Highly crystalline α-zirconium phosphate (α-ZrP)
nanoparticles
were synthesized and exfoliated into nanosheets, and then the hydrophilic
nanosheets were modified into hydrophobic nanosheets with octadecyltrichlorosilane
(OTS). Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis were applied to
confirm the morphology and chemical structure of the nanosheets. Contact
angle measurement was conducted to explore the wettability alteration
of the hydrophobically modified α-ZrP nanosheets, and the result
showed that the wettability of the core was changed into hydrophobicity.
When ZrP–OTS nanosheets were injected during water-flooding,
a Pickering emulsion will be formed. The droplet diameters and viscosities
of the Pickering emulsions were measured. The hydrophobically modified
α-ZrP nanosheets were applied in low-permeability sandstone
cores and various concentrations were tested. The injectivity of the
hydrophobically modified α-ZrP nanosheets was also studied and
the result indicated that the nanosheets exhibit good injectivity.
The mechanisms for enhancing oil recovery by utilizing hydrophobic
α-ZrP nanosheets were analyzed: forming Pickering emulsions
and increasing the viscosity of the displacing phase. Forming emulsions
and increasing the viscosity of the flooding phase can enhance the
microdisplacement efficiency, while good injectivity can also enhance
the macrodisplacement efficiency. The result indicated the possibility
of using hydrophobically modified α-ZrP nanosheets for enhancing
oil recovery in a low-permeability reservoir.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Low-permeability reservoirs
play a significant and increasing role
of oil reserves in the world, but their exploitation always present
poor recovery. Hence, lots of methods have been developed to enhance
oil recovery; because of the relatively cheap cost and easy operation,
water-flooding becomes the reasonable method for the improvement of
oil recovery after primary production in low-permeability reservoirs.
Other methods such as miscible or immiscible gas injection1 and nanofilm flooding technology2 are also popular.

By conducting water-flooding, with
the mechanism of maintaining
the reservoir pressure and displacing crude oil, the recovery can
reach 10–40% of the original oil in place.3 However, there is still considerable amount of oil detained
in the pores after water-flooding, and the reason of this phenomenon
can attribute to interfacial and surface forces. For low-permeability
reservoirs, the urgent issue is the difficulty of injection and high
injecting pressure.

Wettability, as Anderson defined, “the
ability of a fluid
to spread or adhere to the rock surface in the presence of another
immiscible fluid4”, is a major factor
during the process of water-flooding. Some scholars suggested that
after long contact with organic components of oil, the surface of
rocks is oil-wet in some portions.5 In
the primitive reservoir condition, water injection is relatively easy
and the injecting pressure remains stable; however, after long time
water-flooding, this situation will be altered. As the front water
constantly washes the surface of the pores while conducting water-flooding,
the wettability of the pores can be altered into hydrophilicity, and
the post water could be hard to inject, for the existence of hydrogen
bonds.

Nanotechnology, for the utilization of nanomaterials,
can provide
many new methods for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).6−8 Nanoparticles
are in the size of 1–100 nm with dimension, and they have unique
properties for their small sizes also with a greater surface area
per unit volume.9 Nanoparticles can flow
through the pores of the oil reservoirs easily and without any block
because of their small size. In addition, with the large surface/volume
ratio, nanoparticles can be adsorbed on the surface of pores, which
can alter the surface energy and wettability of the system,10 and also the wettability would affect oil recovery
during water-flooding.11 Chaudhury (2003)
and Wasan and Nikolov (2003) first reported that liquids containing
nanoparticles can change the wettability of a solid surface.12,13 Ehtesabi et al. conducted the experiment of using hydrophilic TiO2 nanoparticles to improve recovery of heavy oil from sandstone
cores.14 Wijayanto et al. conducted the
experiment of using hydrophilic aluminosilicate nanoparticles for
enhancing waxy crude oil recovery.15 Numerous
studies have confirmed the ability of nanoparticles to alter porous
media into a more water-wet condition.16−19 All of these methods share the
same characteristics, that is, by injecting the hydrophilic nanoparticles,
altering the wettability of the core, and reducing the interfacial
tension.20−25 However, the utilization of hydrophobic nanoparticles for enhancing
oil recovery has been barely seen in literature studies26,27 and the mechanism is still ambiguous. In our work, we applied hydrophobic
α-ZrP nanomaterials for enhancing oil recovery and analyzed
the main mechanisms.

α-Zirconium phosphate (α-ZrP),
with the formula of
Zr(HPO4)2·H2O, is characterized
for its layered structure and ion-exchange capabilities.28,29 The size of α-ZrP nanomaterials varies from 50 nm to 2 μm
and contains lots of hydroxide groups on the surface.30 Because of the existence of hydroxide groups, α-ZrP
shows the ability of hydrophilicity; hence, hydrophobic alkane is
normally the alternative for modification. α-ZrP nanomaterials
are usually used as rheological thickeners in many areas such as cosmetics
and pharmaceutical products.31 As a member
of lamellar nanomaterials, α-ZrP holds the feature that strong
bonds are in the x and y direction
of the plane while weaker ones are in the z direction;
therefore, guest molecules can achieve intercalation and exfoliation.32 The interlayer distance of α-ZrP nanomaterials
is about 0.76 nm and the thickness of one nanosheet is about 0.66
nm.33 Therefore, α-ZrP can be exfoliated
into monolayers and can be further modified.

In this paper,
we first synthesized highly crystalline α-ZrP
by the refluxing method and then exfoliated α-ZrP nanomaterials
into nanosheets by tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) solution.
HCl solution was subsequently added to make α-ZrP regain activity
regeneration. After that, octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was used
to modify α-ZrP nanosheets from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity.
The results were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Then, the hydrophobically
modified α-ZrP nanosheets were used to conduct the core flooding
test in low-permeability sandstone cores, and the experiment results
showed that hydrophobic α-ZrP nanosheets had good performance
in enhancing oil recovery. The mechanism of this performance was also
studied by contact angle measurement, emulsification test, viscosity
measurement, SEM, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 SEM and TEM
Figure 1a illustrates the SEM image of pristine α-ZrP
nanomaterials which are synthesized by refluxing methods. According
to the image, the α-ZrP nanomaterials exhibit a layered structure
and less regularly hexagonal shape and one single α-ZrP nanomaterial
has the structure with lateral dimensions of about 400 nm. Figure 1b shows the TEM graph
of exfoliated α-ZrP nanosheets. In each pristine α-ZrP
nanomaterials, there are about 30 layers of nanosheets and each monolayer
has a thickness of 0.68 nm.34,35 The distance between
each layer is about 0.76 nm, and each layer is attached with another
mostly by a hydrogen bond because of its abundant hydroxyl groups
(ca. 4.2 group/nm2 per side).36 α-ZrP is a weak inorganic solid acid for it contains medium
strong P–OH Brønsted acid groups. TBAOH is most broadly
used to exfoliate α-ZrP nanoparticles among various reagents.
By reacting with H+ on the surface of α-ZrP nanoparticles
and intercalating into the interlayer, TBAOH solution can exfoliate
ZrP nanoparticles into monolayers. The intercalation process of TBA+ took place first from the edge and then transferred to the
internal gallery of layers.37 Actually,
the whole stage can be divided into two steps, first intercalating
and then exfoliating. The exfoliation can be regarded as an extreme
case of intercalation. However, because of the existence of relatively
higher van der Waals forces, the TBA+ can only partially
exfoliate the α-ZrP nanoparticles, so sonication was adopted
to achieve full exfoliation. By producing ultrasonic cavitation,38 which occurs mainly in the frequency range of
100–1000 kHz, use of sonication can result in complete exfoliation
(shown in Figure 2).

image of α-ZrP nanoparticles and (b) TEM image of
exfoliated α-ZrP nanosheets.

Figure 2 Schematic of the preparation of α-ZrP nanosheets.

2.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Figure 3 shows the
FTIR spectra of pristine α-ZrP, OTS, and hydrophobically modified
α-ZrP (ZrP–OTS). For the pristine α-ZrP, the bands
located at 3510 and 3590 cm–1 represent the asymmetric
and symmetric stretching of the intercalated water, respectively.39 It can be clearly seen from the spectra of ZrP–OTS,
that these two bands had disappeared. It can be attributed to that
the full exfoliation removed this crystalline water, which existed
in the interlayer. The peaks at 3165 and 1620 cm–1 can attribute to symmetric and bending vibrations of −OH
groups in α-ZrP, respectively. The bands at 970 and 1251 cm–1 are due to the out-of-plane and in-plane vibration
of the P–OH groups, respectively. The disappearance of these
bands in ZrP–OTS means the successful reaction of Si–Cl
and −OH groups. In the spectra of OTS, the bands at 2930 and
2850 cm–1 represent the symmetric and asymmetric
stretching of CH2 and CH3 of the long alkyl
chain in OTS, respectively. It can be observed that these two bands
appeared in the spectra of ZrP–OTS, suggesting the successful
covalent grafting on the surface of α-ZrP.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of α-ZrP,
OTS, and ZrP–OTS.

2.3 X-ray Diffraction
The XRD patterns
of α-ZrP nanomaterials and ZrP–OTS are shown in Figure 4. For the pristine
α-ZrP, the interlayer space is ca. 0.76 nm,40 and it can be observed from the pattern, which also indicates
the good crystallinity of the α-ZrP nanomaterials, while in
the XRD pattern of ZrP–OTS, the main sharp peak disappeared
and a new but weak peak appeared at ca. 10.4 Å. When the exfoliation
occurred, the crystalline structure of α-ZrP nanomaterials has
been totally destroyed, which causes the disappearance of the sharp
peak. As the α-ZrP nanosheets get protonated by adding HCl solution,
the nanosheets would get restacked and form a gel because of the existence
of hydrogen bonds on the −OH groups. When the α-ZrP gel
gets dried, recrystallined, and grafted with OTS, the interlayer distance
(ca. 10.4 Å) exhibited is larger than the original one (ca. 7.6
Å) because of the existence of long alkyl chains. In the pattern
of ZrP–OTS, no sharp diffraction peaks were observed as the
α-ZrP nanomaterial pattern, which means that the long chain
alkane was grafted on the α-ZrP nanosheets in random arrangement
and the nanosheets were restacked into a loosely ordered layered structure.

Figure 4 XRD patterns
of α-ZrP and ZrP–OTS.

2.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The thermal
decomposition of the α-ZrP nanomaterials and ZrP–OTS
is studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the results are
shown in Figure 5.
Pristine α-ZrP nanomaterials exhibit two major weight losses
from 118 to 170 and 506 to 607 °C. From 118 to 170 °C, the
pristine α-ZrP nanomaterials display a weight loss of 3%, which
is attributed to the evaporation of the interlayer crystallization
water. From 506 to 607 °C, the 5% weight loss is mainly for the
dehydration condensation reaction of α-ZrP nanomaterials and
the final product is ZrP2O7. For the curve of
ZrP–OTS, the first weight loss appeared from 40 to 100 °C,
which is the loss of the residual solvent on the surface of ZrP–OTS.
There is no similar stage from 100 to 170 °C found on the curve
of ZrP–OTS, which means that the layered structure has been
destructed and the crystallization water has been removed. The next
level of ZrP–OTS starts from 270 to 580 °C, which is mainly
the removal of the grafted long chain alkane and the condensation
of phosphate.

2.5 Wettability Alteration Evaluation
To investigate the wettability alteration ability of the ZrP–OTS
nanosheets, different concentrations are prepared with 20, 50, 100,
200, 500, and 1000 mg/L, by dispersing ZrP–OTS into tetrahydrofuran
solvents. Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) solution (25
mg/L) is also prepared to test its effect. Then, the hydrophilic core
slices, polished by sandpaper first, are soaked in the ZrP–OTS
dispersed system and 25 mg/L CTAB solution for 24 h and dried overnight.
To avoid the nanosheet aggregation, the slices are placed vertically
so that the ZrP–OTS nanosheets can be absorbed on the surface
of the slice freely. After that, the contact angle of the slice is
measured, and the result is shown in Figure 6. The original core slice is highly hydrophilic;
when the water is dropped on the surface of the slice, it will immediately
permeate into the slice, so the original core surface is highly hydrophilic. Figure 6a shows that the
slice is still hydrophilici (CA: 47.7°) which meant that adding
of 25 mg/L CTAB exerts few influences. It can be clearly seen from Figure 6b–g that when
the slice is soaked in 20 mg/L, the contact angle is 73.6°, higher
than the original one while still hydrophilici. It can be attributed
to the reason that when the concentration is low, there are not enough
nanomaterials that are absorbed on the surface of the slice, and the
slice can only partially exhibit hydrophobicity. When the concentrations
are higher, 50 and 100 mg/L, it can be seen that the contact angle
increased correspondingly to 92.7 and 103.5°. This phenomenon
indicates that as the concentration is getting higher, more and more
ZrP–OTS nanosheets are absorbed on the surface of the slice
and alter the wettability of the slice from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity.
However, when the concentrations further increased (200, 500, and
1000 mg/L), the contact angle (113.5, 115.7, and 116.2°) did
not increase significantly. It can be attributed to that when enough
amount of hydrophobic ZrP–OTS nanosheets are absorbed on the
slice, and because of the specific surface energy, the nanosheets
will fully cover the slice and then will not further alter the wettability
of the slice.

of 25
mg/L CTAB; (b–g) contact angle of ZrP–OTS with different
concentrations.

2.6 Emulsification Test and Viscosity Measurement
Pickering emulsion is an emulsion stabilized by solid particles.41 Compared with classical emulsion, normally stabilized
by a surfactant, Pickering emulsion has a specific property. High
resistance to coalescence is a major benefit of Pickering emulsion.42 The existence of ZrP–OTS nanosheets allows
the stabilization of droplets as small as few micrometers. Figure 7a shows the optical
microscopic image of water and crude oil with 25 mg/L CTAB, and Figure 7b shows the image
of water and crude oil (the mass ratio of water/oil is 1/1). It can
be seen that the diameters of the droplet as shown in Figure 7a ranged from 10 to 20 μm
and as shown in Figure 7b ranged from 50 to 100 μm. However, both of the emulsions
were not stable. When ZrP–OTS nanosheets were added in the
system (Figure 7c–f),
the solid nanosheets were adsorbed onto the water/oil interface, and
the surface energy reduced, which led to the stabilization of the
emulsion. The droplet diameters decreased with the increase of ZrP–OTS.
When the concentrations of ZrP–OTS are low (20 and 50 mg/L),
the diameters of the droplet ranged between 20 and 30 μm. When
the concentration is 100 mg/L, the diameter of the droplet was about
10 μm. However, when the concentration was higher (500 mg/L),
the diameter did not decrease obviously. When the ZrP–OTS nanosheets
are added during the water-flooding process, w/o Pickering emulsion
can be formed and thus will enhance the fluidity of the oil.

The viscosities of water and crude oil are 1.08
and 9.76 mPa·s,
respectively, which are measured by using a Brookfield viscosimeter.
The viscosities of emulsified oil with different ZrP–OTS concentrations
are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the viscosities of emulsified oil are between
those of water and crude oil.

2.7 Injectivity Study of ZrP–OTS Nanosheets
Nanomaterials have a good effect when applied for EOR; however,
nanomaterials are easy to get accumulated and cause blockage in the
pore. This phenomenon is more serious in low-permeability reservoirs,
so it is necessary to study the injectivity of ZrP–OTS nanosheets.
Five different concentrations of ZrP–OTS nanosheets are prepared
to study the injectivity. CTAB (25 mg/L) is also prepared to study
its influence. The parameters of the sandstone cores are shown in Table 2, and the flooding
pressures before and after injection are shown in Table 3 and Figure 8, respectively.

and after 25 mg/L and ZrP–OTS

4	200	1.6104	1.4342	
5	500	1.6097	1.4189	
It can be observed from Table 3 and Figure 8 that the flooding pressure stabled about 1.6 MPa.
When 25
mg/L CTAB solution is injected, the injecting pressure is barely changed,
which means that the CTAB exerted few influences in the flooding process
for its weaker hydrophobicity than ZrP–OTS nanosheets. When
the ZrP–OTS solution is injected, the injecting pressure decreases
obviously. When the injecting concentration is 50 mg/L, the flooding
pressure decreases to 1.56 MPa, and when the injecting pressure is
500 mg/L, the flooding pressure decreases to 1.41 MPa. This indicates
that the blockage phenomenon did not occur. The results indicate that
the ZrP–OTS nanosheets have excellent injectivity.

To
understand the mechanism, the core slice was studied by SEM
and EDS. Figure 9 shows
the morphology of the core surface before flooding. The pores of the
core can be clearly seen and the size of the pore tunnel lies in the
micrometer scale. When ZrP–OTS solution is injected, only part
of the surface is deposited with ZrP–OTS nanosheets. As previously
tested (Figure 6),
different ZrP–OTS concentrations displayed different wettability
alteration abilities. When the concentration is low (20 mg/L), only
a small amount of ZrP–OTS nanosheets is adsorbed on the surface
of the core and only sporadic nanosheets can be found in the SEM image
as shown in Figure 10a; also, only a very small portion of Zr is detected in the EDS scanning
(Figure 10b). When
the concentration is higher (500 mg/L), it can be clearly seen that
few layers of ZrP–OTS nanosheets are deposited on the surface
of the core (Figure 11a) and the Zr element took a larger portion than before (Figure 11b). The Zr element
is deposited homogenously on the surface of the pore (Figure 12). However, the ZrP–OTS
nanosheets did not cause blockage because of their thin layered structure.

solution
and (b) EDS measurement of the core after flooding by 500 mg/L ZrP–OTS
solution.

Figure 12 EDS map of Zr after flooding with 500 mg/L ZrP–OTS.

The system potential energy is reduced when ZrP–OTS
nanosheets
are adsorbed on the surface, which enable the absorption to be more
stable. As the ZrP–OTS nanosheets transformed the wettability
of the surface from hydrophilicity into hydrophobicity, during the
water-flooding process, there is layered density distribution of water
molecules, and the density is smaller when the surface is hydrophilic,
for the reduction of potential energy. In addition, the nonuniform
density distribution near the surface still exists, which makes the
average density reduce and format the low density layer of the hydrophobic
surface. When the potential energy between water and core surface,
as the surface exhibits hydrophobic, there is obvious slippage effect
existing,43,44 which plays important role in the injecting
pressure reducing. With the unique layered structure, the ZrP–OTS
nanosheets can exhibit long detention time after long time water-flooding
and will not cause apparent blockage in the long-range injection.

2.8 Core Flooding Experiment
Five different
concentrations are used to evaluate the ZrP–OTS nanosheets’
ability for EOR and the parameters of the core are shown in Table 4. The oil recovery
efficiencies before and after injecting ZrP–OTS nanosheets
are shown in Table 5.

Table 5 shows the
increase in oil recovery as the ZrP–OTS nanosheet concentrations
increase. When ZrP–OTS nanosheets are injected into the core
and encounter oil, a stabilized w/o Pickering emulsion will be formed
during the water-flooding process, as previous analysis. The w/o Pickering
emulsion can increase the microdisplacement efficiency (ED) by enhancing the fluidity of the oil phase. Conversely,
the Pickering emulsion, as the flooding phase, with the decreasing
fluidity compared with pristine water, can enhance the macrodisplacement
efficiency (Ev) by reducing the mobility
ratio.

The effect of good injectivity can enhance the macrodisplacement
efficiency (Ev) by increasing the sweep
efficiency. The overall displacement efficiency  

Hence, the macrodisplacement efficiency
(Ev) and microdisplacement efficiency
(ED) both are enhanced and the overall
displacement efficiency
can subsequently get enhanced.

When the ZrP–OTS nanosheets
are injected, the Pickering
emulsion is formed, and the Pickering emulsion becomes the new displacing
phase fluid. As the viscosity (μD) of the Pickering
emulsion is higher than that of the previous one (water, 1 mPa·s),
the mobility ratio  where λD is the mobility
of the displacing phase, λd is the mobility of the
displaced phase, KD is the permeability
of the displacing phase, Kd is the permeability
of the displaced phase, μD is the viscosity of the
displacing phase, and μd is the viscosity of the
displaced phase. When the viscosity of the displacing phase (μD) increases, the mobility ratio (M) will
decrease. The decrease in the mobility ratio (M)
will increase the sweep efficiency (Ev) and retard the vicious fingering phenomenon.

This result
reveals the possibility of using hydrophobically modified
α-ZrP nanosheets for EOR after water-flooding in the low-permeability
core. Water-flooding is the mostly applied method for improving oil
recovery because of its relatively cheap cost. α-ZrP nanoparticles,
as inexpensive and environmentally friendly materials, have unique
properties compared with other nanomaterials. The combination of water-flooding
and α-ZrP nanomaterials may open a new door for petroleum exploitation.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, highly crystalline
α-ZrP nanoparticles are
successfully synthesized and subsequently exfoliated into nanosheets.
OTS is used to modify α-ZrP nanosheets into hydrophobic. Then,
the injectivity of ZrP–OTS nanosheets is studied. The flooding
pressures before and after ZrP–OTS injection are measured,
which indicate obvious depressurization during the flooding process.
SEM and EDS show that the nanosheets are deposited on the slice uniformly.
The performance of hydrophobically modified α-ZrP nanosheets
for EOR in a low-permeability core is studied. The recovery efficiency
can be improved 19% after applying hydrophobic α-ZrP nanosheets.
Contact angle measurement implied that nanosheet adsorption changed
the wettability of the core slice. The diameter of the Pickering emulsion
droplet is measured, and the result indicates that the diameter decreases
as the nanosheet concentration increases. However, when the concentration
exceeds 100 mg/L, the diameter will not change significantly. The
viscosity of the Pickering emulsion was also measured and the result
shows that the viscosity increased. As the displacing phase fluid,
the increasing viscosity of the w/o Pickering emulsion can decrease
the mobility ratio (M) and increase the sweep efficiency
(Ev). In summary, hydrophobically modified
α-ZrP nanosheets show the possibility for EOR. Being environmentally
friendly and low cost, α-ZrP nanomaterials have a promising
prospect for commercialized industry EOR materials.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Synthesis of α-ZrP Nanoparticles
The α-ZrP nanomaterials were synthesized by the refluxing method.45 First, 9.66 g of ZrOCl2·8H2O was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water, and then 60 mL
of 12 mol/L H3PO4 was added dropwise in the
solution with continuous stirring at room temperature. Then, the mixed
system was stirred and refluxed at 100 °C for 24 h. After the
reaction, the product was centrifuged and rinsed three times with
deionized water to remove the excess H3PO4 and
dried overnight at 65 °C. Then, the product was ground with a
mortar and pestle into fine powder to get highly crystalline α-ZrP
powder.

4.2 Preparation of Single-Layer α-ZrP Nanosheets
α-ZrP (1 g) was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water, and
then 30 mL of 0.1 mol/L TBAOH (the molar ratio of α-ZrP/TBAOH
is 1) solution was added dropwise to reach a constant pH of 8.0. Care
was taken to avoid higher pH conditions, otherwise it can lead to
rapid corrosion of the sheets.33 The colloidal
suspension was subsequently treated with 100 kHz ultrasonication for
4 h to achieve full exfoliation. After the colloidal suspension was
turned into solution of clarity and transparency, 30 mL of 0.1 mol/L
HCl (the same molar of TBAOH) was added dropwise, and then the gelatinous
precipitate of α-ZrP nanosheets was collected by centrifugation
and washed with deionized water until the chloride ions were fully
removed (silver nitrate solution was used to confirm the result).
The α-ZrP nanosheet gel was then rinsed with acetone three times
to exchange the gel from water to acetone; subsequently, the nanosheet
gel was washed with toluene following the previous procedure, which
ultimately transports the α-ZrP nanosheet gel into toluene solvent
with the assistance of ultrasonication.

4.3 Hydrophobic Modification of α-ZrP Nanosheets
The prepared α-ZrP nanosheet gel was dispersed in 50 mL of
toluene solvent, and then 1 mL of OTS solution was added into the
system. The mixed system was placed at 30 °C for 3 h with mild
stirring, and then the product was centrifuged and washed three times
with absolute ethanol. The obtained modified α-ZrP was dried
overnight at 65 °C and ground into powder (labeled as ZrP–OTS).

4.4 Injectivity Study and Core Flooding Experiment
ZrP–OTS nanosheets were dispersed in deionized water by
adding a few amount of CTAB(5 wt % ZrP–OTS nanosheets, and
the maximum 25 mg/L CTAB solution was also employed to study its influence)
with the assistance of an FJ200-S homogenizer at 10 000 rpm
for 2 min and ultrasonication. Different concentrations of ZrP–OTS-dispersed
solutions were prepared. To study the injectivity of ZrP–OTS
nanosheets, the low-permeability manmade core was flooded by deionized
water to measure its water-flooding pressure. In addition, the ZrP–OTS
dispersed solution was injected into the core and the ZrP–OTS
flooding pressure was obtained. Another group of cores was applied
for the EOR experiment. First, the core was saturated with brine water
and then with crude oil and aged for 48 h. Then, brine water was used
to flood the core until no more oil was produced. Subsequently, ZrP–OTS
of 2 PV dispersed solution was injected, and then post water-flooding
was conducted until no more oil existed (the schematic of the core
flooding experiment is shown in Figure 13).

Figure 13 Schematic of the core flooding experiment.

4.5 Characterizations
SEM was performed
by using a field emission scanning electron microanalyzer (FEI Quanta
450) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV to observe the morphology
and the micropores of α-ZrP nanoparticles and the micropores.
FTIR by using Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet 6700 ranging from 800
to 4000 cm–1 was implemented to analyze the chemical
composition of pristine α-ZrP nanoparticles, OTS, and modified
α-ZrP nanosheets. XRD measurement was applied to detect the
crystal structure of pristine α-ZrP nanoparticles and ZrP–OTS
by using a PANalytical X’Pert-Pro diffractometer (40 kV, 40
mA) with Cu (λ = 1.54 Å) irradiation at a scanning rate
of 2 °/s in the 2θ range of 4–40°, and the
scan compensation is 20 °/min. TGA was carried out using a NETZSCH
simultaneous thermal analyzer model STA 449F3 and with a heating rate
of 10 °C/min from 40 to 800 °C in an aluminum crucible under
an inert gas atmosphere.
