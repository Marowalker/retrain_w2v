A high-throughput label-free resonant
waveguide grating biosensor,
the Epic BenchTop, was utilized to in situ monitor the adhesion process
of cancer cells on Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide displaying biomimetic polymer
surfaces. Using highly adherent human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa)
cells as a model system, cell adhesion kinetic data with outstanding
temporal resolution were obtained. We found that pre-exposing the
cells to various concentrations of the main extract of green tea,
the (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), largely affected the
temporal evolution of the adhesion process. For unexposed and low
dosed cells, sigmoid shaped spreading kinetics was recorded. Higher
dose of EGCG resulted in a complete absence of the sigmoidal character,
and displayed adsorption-like kinetics. By using the first derivatives
of the kinetic curves, a simple model was developed to quantify the
sigmoidal character and the transition from sigmoidal to adsorption-like
kinetics. The calculations showed that the transition happened at
EGCG concentration of around 60 μg/mL. Using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide end-point assay, we concluded that EGCG is cytostatic but
not cytotoxic. The effect of EGCG was also characterized by flow cytometry.
We concluded that, using the introduced label-free methodology, the
shape of the cell adhesion kinetic curves can be used to quantify
in vitro cell viability in a fast, cost-effective, and highly sensitive
manner.

Introduction
Natural compounds are becoming more and
more popular in biomedicine,
especially in cancer treatment and to develop novel antimicrobial
agents.1−4 Tea catechins, especially (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG),
have been shown to have various health benefits, for example, anti-metastasis,
anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, and can
prevent cardiovascular disease as well.5−8 EGCG is one of the most studied active substances,
and many studies observed its effects on several cancer and normal
cell types, and in animal models.4 This
compound has significant impact on cell adhesion and movement, apoptosis,
and proliferation, generally by altering gene expression.4,5,9−11 Tea polyphenols
are well known for their antioxidant activities, too.5,12 Among them, EGCG is the most effective compound interacting with
reactive oxygen species.13 EGCG and other
catechins are unstable at high temperature and under alkaline and
neutral conditions; EGCG oxidizes and dimerizes easily5,12,14at pH above 7.5,12,14 In an aqueous solution, it changes from
noncolored at around natural pH to yellow at higher pH; the absorption
in the UV range becomes more pronounced.4,5,15

Determination of cell viability is a critical
step in screening
the efficacy of compounds, when evaluating the response to cytotoxic
moiety. Flow cytometry is a sensitive and mainstream method to determine
compound-induced cytotoxic effects and cell death. The main advantage
of the method allows the analysis on a per-cell basis using fluorescent
dyes to enter viable or dead cells. Propidium-iodide (PI) is a polar,
fluorescent compound and can only enter cells that lack membrane integrity.
After PI staining, nonviable cells show a bright red fluorescence,
whereas viable cells remain nonfluorescent.16 Using the plate-based 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) method, the membrane permeability and mitochondrial
activity of the cells were determined in metabolically active cells.17

However, most of the label-based assays
have serious disadvantages,
for example, labeling techniques use fluorescent markers that may
affect normal cell behavior and the imaging time is often limited
by the low signal and the bleaching of the marker.5

Detection of cellular adhesion is of significant
diagnostic and
basic research utility. Changes in cell adhesion can be a sign for
various illnesses; for example, the variety of integrins, a major
group of cell adhesion receptors that bind to the extracellular matrix,
changes during tumor transformation.5 Measurement
of the effect of bioactive substances on the adhesion of tumor cells
can be an effective tool in the design of antineoplastic pharmaceuticals.5 A wide range of previously existing and well-documented,
conventional label-based experimental methods are available to assess
cellular processes such as in vitro cell viability and adhesion.5,18−25

Label-free biosensors, not requiring the usage of dyes, have
the
ability to become a routine tool for measuring cell adhesion, spreading,
proliferation, signalization, and cytotoxicity as well.5 These techniques are especially promising when
the real-time kinetics of interactions have to be investigated.

In the measurements of label-free techniques, biomimetic surfaces
are usually applied as coatings to create circumstances that resemble
the real biological conditions. The biomimetic surfaces mimic the
materials that occur in vivo, but these artificial substrates are
simpler to hand, they need less preparations, and the created coatings
are more reproducible.

Poly(l-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol)
(PLL-g-PEG) is a biomimetic polycationic copolymer
with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains covalently grafted onto a
positively charged PLL backbone. It spontaneously adsorbs from the
aqueous solution via electrostatic interactions onto negatively charged
surfaces such as tissue culture polystyrene, TiO2, Nb2O5, and SiO2.5,26,27 However, several studies have shown that
it can also adsorb onto nonpolar, hydrophobic poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) surfaces from the aqueous solutions. The PEG side chains stretch
into the bulk aqueous solution to generate a brushlike conformation
due to its high affinity for water. Recent studies have shown that
a PLL-g-PEG layer on metal oxide surfaces displays
resistance to a nonspecific adsorption of proteins and cell adhesion.5,27,28

The copolymer and its cell
adhesive, functionalized counterpart
with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, PLL-g-PEG-RGD, can
be mixed to vary the cell adhesion ligand density and to promote cell
adhesion and spreading on the coated surfaces.5 Here, we use the mixture of PLL-g-PEG and PLL-g-PEG-RGD to create highly cell adhesive surfaces in a reproducible
manner.5,29,30

In the
present work, we investigate the adhesion kinetics of EGCG
pre-exposed cells on PLL-g-PEG-RGD as biomimetic
surfaces using the Epic BenchTop (BT) resonant waveguide grating (RWG)
biosensor. The Epic BT employs resonant waveguide gratings arranged
in a 96- or 384-well array format. In each well, the resonant wavelength
of the waveguide is monitored, which is sensitive to refractive index
variations above the sensing surface. This surface-sensitive high-throughput
label-free technique was previously demonstrated to monitor cell signaling
and adhesion.5,30−35 Thanks to its excellent temporal resolution, the cellular adhesion
can be recorded with unprecedented data quality.30 This feature is exploited in the present work by investigating
the shapes of the cell adhesion kinetic curves in detail. A simple
model is created to quantify the shape of the kinetic curves. The
results of the label-free investigations are compared with classical
MTT assay and flow cytometry employing PI staining. Our work demonstrates
a novel way to measure cell viability in a fast, label-free, and highly
sensitive manner.

Results and Discussion
In vitro
effect of EGCG on cellular viability was accessed by three
different methods using HeLa cells: (i) to analyze real-time cell
adhesion kinetics, (ii) to determine metabolic activity using colorimetric
MTT assay, and (iii) to quantify dead or dying cells by cytofluorometry
with PI staining.

The plate-based EPIC system is suitable for
observing adhesive
parameters in real time as physiologically relevant and quantitative
data related to the cellular fitness and viability. The optical core
of the sensing procedure is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. Using classic end-point
tetrazolium reduction, the cytostatic or cytotoxic activity can be
determined through enzymatic activity as a marker of viable cells
generating a signal that is proportional to the number of viable cells.

Figure 1 Schematic
illustration of the working principle of the Epic BT
biosensor. An optical biosensor found in each well is illuminated
by a broadband light source. The biosensor contains a grating coupled
planar optical waveguide and its surface can be coated with a protein
or polymer of interest. Light coupled into the waveguide creates a
resonant mode and a corresponding evanescent field penetrating to
a depth of 150 nm above the sensor surface. Any refractive index change
inside the evanescent field shifts the resonant wavelength of light
reflected back from the biosensor. The biosensor signal is the wavelength
shift of the reflected light. (A) If there is no change in the evanescent
field, there is no signal. (B) The cell attaches but does not adhere
onto the biosensor surface. This phenomenon represents an adsorption
kinetic curve, which indicates a nonliving, “dead” process.
Note, it also occurs when proteins adsorb onto the surface. (C) The
cells adhere onto the biosensor surface. This phenomenon represents
a sigmoidal kinetic curve, which indicates a “living”
process. (D) Schematic graph of the difference (Δλ) between
the resonant peak wavelengths of the reflected lights. The equipment
plots the Δλ data in time during the experiment (see C
and B).

Adhesion Kinetics of EGCG Pre-Exposed Cells
Recorded by the
Optical Biosensor
The schematic illustration of the employed
methodology is summarized in Figure 2. One can observe an interesting phenomenon on the
kinetic curves measured by Epic BT.

Figure 2 Summarized schematic illustration of the
label-free method employing
the Epic BT biosensor. Cells were pre-exposed to various concentrations
of EGCG and then transferred to the biosensor wells to record their
adhesion and spreading on the RGD displaying polymer surfaces. As
the most striking observation, cell spreading with low concentration
of EGCG or without EGCG shows sigmoidal-like kinetic curves (active,
living process), whereas treatments with high concentration of EGCG
result in adsorption-like kinetic curves (dead process).

If the cells can well adhere and spread, sigmoidal-like
curves
can be monitored as a characteristic pattern of living cells (living
process). In contrast, at higher concentration, adsorption-like curves
imply that the observed change is due to dying or dead cells (dead
process). Note, the adsorption-like curves are typically observed
when discrete objects are adsorbing on a solid surface. In this case,
the main driving force is the unoccupied surface area; therefore,
the adsorption is fastest at the very beginning, when the free surface
area is maximal. In contrast, the sigmoidal kinetics require an active,
self-catalytic, and self-controlled mechanism, a unique characteristics
of the living cells.

In these measurements, we both monitored
the sigmoidal- and adsorption-like
kinetic curves, depending on the concentration of the EGCG. At values
lower than the added 40 μg/mL of EGCG, we received spreading
curves (active, living process), and above this value, adsorption
curves (dead process) (Figure 3). (Supposedly, due to the EGCG, the cells—instead
of active adhesion—may even secrete some cell-specific compounds
at higher extract concentrations.) This border concentration is approximately
40–50 μg/mL, above which the EGCG has harmful effects
on the cancer cells.

Figure 3 Kinetic cell adhesion curves recorded by Epic BT. The
plotted lines
represent the averaged values of the three parallel experiments. For
obtaining these data, the cells were preincubated with solutions having
different EGCG concentrations. After, these treated cells were pipetted
into the biosensor wells and cell adhesion was monitored for 2 h.
It is clearly seen that increasing the EGCG concentration decreases
the sigmoidal character of the kinetic curves. For the highest EGCG
concentrations, the sigmoidal character is completely missing and
adsorption-like curves are recorded.

Following the EGCG preincubation, our observation was that
the
size of the cells shrunk and their shape, spreading, and adhesive
properties also changed. The microscopy images (Figure 4) clearly show that at low EGCG concentrations
(0–40 μg/mL), the cells could well adhere and spread;
after the 2 h period, the cells almost formed a homogeneous layer
on the RGD displaying a biosensor surface. However, at higher EGCG
concentrations of 40–50 μg/mL, the shape of the cells
changed; they are not as spread as the other cells with lower concentrations
or without green tea extract. At higher quantities, the cells remained
rounded. The observation of the same phenomenon can be followed on
the kinetic curves as mentioned earlier.

Figure 4 Microscopic images of
the cells after the measurement in the Epic
BT microplate wells. (A) Cells without EGCG treatment could spread
onto the surface and form adhesive contacts. (B) Cells treated with
250 μg/mL EGCG (highest concentration) remained rounded and
spreading was inhibited. Scale bar: 100 μm. The differences
between the cells treated by the lowest EGCG concentrations cannot
be detected by phase contrast microscopy (images not shown). Note,
in contrast, the label-free kinetic curves well demonstrate the differences
even at low EGCG concentrations (see Figure 3 for more details).

In Vitro Cytotoxic and Cytostatic Activity of the Compound EGCG
on HeLa Cell Culture (MTT assay)
Tetrazolium salts are widely
used for in vitro assessment of metabolic activity of cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) reduction is one of the most frequently used methods
for measuring cytotoxicity and cell proliferation.36 HeLa cells were treated with EGCG at 0.064–500 μg/mL
concentration range and the viability of the cells was determined
by using the MTT assay.

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined from the dose–response curves.
We found that EGCG exhibited a modest, but not negligible cytotoxic
effect on HeLa cells (IC50 > 500 μg/mL). From
the
dose–response curves, it can be observed that the results obtained
with the Epic BT measurements are reconcilable: the transition concentration
is probably 20–30 μg/mL in the MTT cell cytotoxicity
assay as well. The cytostasis assay (at 0.064–1000 μg/mL
concentration range) shows higher inhibitory concentrations.

Evaluation
of Viability Profiles of EGCG-Treated HeLa Cells
by Flow Cytometry
The cells were exposed to EGCG for 1.5
h. Following the exposure and removal of EGCG by washing and trypsinization
of the cells, they were transferred to the FACS tubes and stained
with PI. As HeLa is an adherent culture, when preparing the samples
for assay, the cells is carefully harvested to avoid the loss or damage
of a certain subpopulations, and the cells are thoroughly processed
to single-cell suspension before PI staining. The data shown are typical
of those obtained from repeated experiments. The spontaneous cell
death due to sample preparation was determined for untreated control
cells (5–10% of death). For maximum lysis (100% of death),
the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 20 μL of saponin
at 0.3 mg/mL (data not shown). A threshold was set on the forward
scatter to exclude cell debris or any artifacts. The gates that were
obtained with FACSDiva software and used for data acquisition. The
gated dead cells were displayed on a histogram of log-scale red fluorescence
of PI to enable the differentiation between dead and live HeLa cells.
The cell death was expressed as the percentage of PI positive cells.

Quantification of the Shape of the Label-Free Kinetic Curves:
Comparison with Classical Cell Viability Assays
We analyzed
the kinetic curves of the Epic BT in more detail by using the following
ideas. First, the kinetic data were differentiated (first derivative)
and the following parameter was calculated. 1   is the first
derivative maximal value,  is the first derivative at the t = 0 timepoint
(see Figures 6 and 7 for more details). Note,
in the actual calculations, the first derivative recorded at 2.5 min
was used instead of the first derivative at t = 0
due to practical reasons.

The parameter Δ characterizes
the shape of the kinetic curves in a straightforward manner. Simply,
if Δ > 0 pm/min, the recorded curve has a sigmoidal character.
For all adsorption-like curves (having the maximum of the first derivative
at t = 0), the parameter Δ is zero. Therefore,
these two types of behaviors can be well distinguished.

The
schematic illustration of the method is seen in Figure 5 with all of the relevant parameters
highlighted. The time dependency of the first derivatives for the
actual biosensor measurements are plotted in Figure 6.

Figure 5 Schematic illustration of the calculation method to reveal the
transition EGCG concentration from the Epic BT data from sigmoidal-
to adsorption-like curves. (A) Typical sigmoidal- and adsorption-like
kinetic curves. (B) The first derivative of the curves plotted in
(A) with the parameters appearing in the equation of Δ highlighted.
In case of adsorption-like curves, the parameter Δ is 0 because
the first derivative at t = 0 timepoint is equal
to the first derivative’s maximum value.

Figure 6 First derivatives of the kinetic curves recorded by Epic BT (and
plotted in Figure 4). Data corresponding to HeLa cells treated by EGCG from 0 to 250
μg/mL concentrations and a buffer control is shown. It is clearly
seen that the character of the kinetic curves drastically changes
as the EGCG concentration is increased.

Next, the Δ values for various EGCG concentrations
were plotted
with the concentration data at the x-axis (logarithmic
scale), and the data points were fitted with a linear curve (Figure 7A). The Δ values are 0 pm/min at concentrations higher
than 40 μg/mL and >0 at lower concentrations. The exact transition
concentration is 60 ± 40 μg/mL, calculated by linear extrapolation
(Figure 7A). The error
of the calculation is estimated from the standard errors of the linear
fit. To compare the label-free data with the findings of the labeling
methods, we plotted the MTT cytostasis (Figure 7B), cytotoxicity (Figure 7C), and flow cytometry results (Figure 7D).

Figure 7 Calculated dose–response
curves and the transition concentration
compared with the results of the MTT and cytofluorimetric assays.
(A) Plotted and fitted Δ values. On the left, Δ > 0
pm/min,
indicating an active cell spreading process. On the right, at higher
EGCG concentrations, Δ values are 0 pm/min, showing an adsorption-like
process. The transition concentration between these two types of behaviors
is 60 ± 40 μg/mL, calculated by linear extrapolation. (B)
Result of the in vitro cytostatic activity assay. It shows higher
inhibitory concentrations than cytotoxicity test. (C) Result of the
in vitro cytotoxicity assay (MTT assay). EGCG exhibited a modest,
but not negligible cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells (IC50 > 500 μg/mL). (D) Result of the in vitro flow cytometry
assay.
Cell death rate was expressed as the percentage of PI positive cells.

The calculated transition concentration
is compatible with the
MTT assay because this is the point where the fitted dose–response
curve (cytostatic activity) starts to increase as well. From the results
shown in Figure 7,
the novel method based on Epic BT seems to be much more sensitive
because it shows evident dose dependence even under effective, transition
concentration as well, whereas the other two MTT curves do not show
a difference. Therefore, there is a dose-dependent noncytotoxic effect
as well, which can be clearly monitored and highlighted by Epic BT.
Therefore, the above protocol might serve as an alternative way to
quantitatively characterize cell viability in a completely label-free
and highly sensitive manner.

In general, the Epic BT assay was
more sensitive than the flow
cytometric or MTT assay. The MTT assay gave results approximately
comparable to those from the flow cytometric assay. In comparing the
flow cytometric with the MTT assay, we find higher standard deviations
with the flow cytometric assay (standard deviation less than 10–15%
of mean versus 6–8% for the MTT assay).

Moreover, Epic
BT is a high-throughput and fast method. Only 1
h would have been enough to receive the maximum values of the derivative
curves (see Figure 6). These features make this measurement technique highly cost-effective
too, when compared with standard biosensing equipment having a single
measurement channel. Significant amount of time can be saved by performing
hundreds of experiments in a single run. Moreover, the status of the
cells and the condition of the reagents are always the same in these
parallel performed experiments. It should be also emphasized that
the results obtained by the biosensor are not affected by any molecules
typically used for labeling and possibly even interacting with the
investigated compounds.

Conclusions
Cell-based assays are
widely used to determine if a compound has
a cytostatic activity or a direct cytotoxic effect leading to cell
death. To access cellular viability plays an important role in the
functional characterization of a molecule. There are wide variety
of cell viability methods that provide accurate picture of cytostatic
and cytotoxic activity, such as colometric assays and cytofluorimetric
analysis of individual cells. Previous studies have shown that EGCG
can inhibit cell adhesion,5,23,24,37 and this extract has an obstructive
effect not just on cancer cell adhesion but also on cell movement
and can induce apoptosis too,9,23,24,37−39 whereas EGCG
has an influence on cell viability as well. The classic colorimetric
end-point method to evince this effect is the MTT assay; however,
both MTT- and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS)-based assays underestimate the antiproliferative
effect of EGCG. This phenomenon is probably due to the increased activity
of mitochondrial dehydrogenase in response to the EGCG treatment,
as well as the intrinsic potential of EGCG to reduce MTT and MTS and
increase the formation of formazan.17 Thus,
a careful evaluation of the applied method is essential for the in
vitro assessment of cell viability and proliferation17 after EGCG treatment.

To monitor compound-induced,
real-time dose response, label-free
technologies were demonstrated to be robust, but sensitive tools with
high statistical significance and reduced artifacts.32,40,41

In this study, the Epic
BT—a novel high-throughput label-free
RWG biosensor—was applied to study the effect of EGCG on the
kinetics of cancer cell adhesion. The recorded real-time adhesion
curves were compared with the data of MTT and flow cytometric cell
viability assays.

On the basis of the kinetic information, we
identified normal spreading
curves, i.e., an active process of living HeLa cells, at EGCG concentrations
lower than 60 μg/mL. Above this concentration, we observed simple
adsorption curves lacking normal cell spreading, i.e., a cytostatic
effect on HeLa cells is seen. We calculated that 60 ± 40 μg/mL
is a transition concentration between the two types of kinetic curves
by developing a straightforward mathematical methodology. This concentration
value is the starting point of the increasing part of the fitted cell
viability cytostatic curve obtained from the MTT assays. Our results
show that the high-throughput Epic BT biosensor can be successfully
applied in cytotoxicity assays with a superior sensitivity.

Our technique offers a noninvasive, label-free, cost-effective
platform to characterize cell viability with a high sensitivity and
an accurate correlation with the conventional (classical) tetrazolium
method. Furthermore, this appliance distinguishes the differences
between the efficacy caused by very low EGCG concentrations as well,
whereas the effects of low concentrations were too small to be reliably
defined by the colorimetric or flow cytometry methods. These data
points were represented as scattered flat sections (plateaus) on the
respective graphs. The intensity of the measured signal (effect of
EGCG based on absorbance or intracellular fluorescence intensity)
is not detectable or difficult to quantify; the small changes produced
by low concentrations of EGCG become lost within the base noise.

Using the label-free method, the observation range was considerably
extended due to the enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. The data evaluation
and the quantification of the differences are simpler in the case
of Epic BT as well. Thus, it may have an important role in biomedical
research, for example, in early or second stage drug candidate testing
due to its predictive ability. In our opinion, another possible scope
of the introduced methodology is the testing of cytostatic or cytotoxic
compounds on different tumor cells even from patients to find drugs
that are harmful to the drug-resistant tumor cells as well. One would
be able to measure a lot of active substances simultaneously in a
very short time (in approximately 1 h); 16 drugs with their 8 concentrations
or 8 drugs with their 16 concentrations in the case of a 384-well
plate in triplicates. In this measurement/diagnostic, the spread cells
could be separated from the dead ones in the first run, and then the
survived cells could be treated with other active compounds in the
second run.

Materials and Methods
Synthetic Polymer Solutions
The
synthetic copolymers,
poly(l-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol)
(PLL-g-PEG, [PLL(20)-g(3.5)-PEG(2)])
(hereafter PP) and its RGD functionalized counterpart, PLL-g-PEG/PEG-GGGGYGRGDSP (PLL-g-PEG-RGD [PLL(20)-g(3.5)-PEG(2.3)/PEG(3.4)-RGD]) (hereafter PPR), were obtained
as powders from SuSoS AG, Dübendorf, Switzerland. The materials
were stored at −20 °C until use. Each powder was then
dissolved in 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Schelldorf, Germany) at pH
7.4 to make stock the solutions with a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL.
The coating solution with RGD motifs and PLL-g-PEG
were prepared by mixing the two 1 mg/mL stock solutions (hereafter
PP/PPR).5,30

Preparation of EGCG Solutions
The
EGCG powder (Sigma-Aldrich
Chemie GmbH, Schelldorf, Germany) was solved in 10 mM HEPES at pH
7.4, or in an assay buffer (Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS,
Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Schelldorf, Germany) containing 20 mM HEPES,
pH 7.0, hereafter HBSS–HEPES). The concentration of the dissolved
EGCG solution was 1, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 200, and 500 μg/mL,
resulted in a final concentration of 0.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 100,
and 250 μg/mL, respectively, in the biosensor wells.

Cell Culture
and Cell Adhesion Assay Buffer
HeLa cells
(ECACC 93021013 human, cervix, epitheloid, carcinoma) were routinely
cultured in tissue culture polystyrene Petri dishes (Greiner Bio-One
International GmbH, Kremsmünster, Austria) placed in a humidified
incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). The cells were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biowest SAS, France), 4 mM l-glutamine, 0.25 μg/mL amphotericin B, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin solution. On reaching 80% confluence,
the cells were detached every 3–4 days using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin
and 0.02% (w/v) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution and
not used beyond passage 20.6,38 The cell adhesion assay
buffer was prepared by adding 20 mM HEPES to HBSS and adjusted to
pH 7.0 with a 1 mM NaOH.5,30

Epic Benchtop Resonant
Waveguide Grating Biosensor
We used the Epic BenchTop (BT)
system (Corning Incorporated, Corning,
NY), a next-generation resonant waveguide grating (RWG) imager biosensor.
It accepts 96- or 384-well Society for Biomolecular Screening standard
format biosensor microplates. The bottom of the microplate is a planar
optical waveguide—a thin, high refractive index, transparent
dielectric layer (waveguide layer, made of the biocompatible material
niobium pentoxide) deposited on a thicker glass substratum.5,30 At the central position of each well, a 2 × 2 mm2 optical grating is embedded into the optical structure to enable
the interrogation of the TM0 waveguide mode using a near-infrared
electromagnetic radiation. Thus, individually addressable biosensors
are created in each well of the microplate. All wells of an Epic microplate
are simultaneously interrogated every 3 s by sweeping the illuminating
wavelength through a range of 15 000 pm with 0.25 pm precision
(in the range of 825–840 nm).5,30 Waveguide
mode excitation only happens at a certain wavelength, called the resonant
wavelength (λ). The refractive index variation in an approximately
150 nm thick layer (in the probing depth of the so-called evanescent
wave) over the biosensor surface shifts the resonant wavelength to
λ′. The refractive index variation can be caused by,
for example, bulk refractive index change, molecular adsorption, cell
spreading, or dynamic mass redistribution inside the cells. The primary
signal output of the Epic BT system is the shift in the resonant wavelength
(Δλ = λ′ – λ) in each well.5,30

EGCG Pretreatment of Cancer Cells and the Biosensor Measurement
Wells were given 30 μL assay buffer to prewet the sensors
and establish a baseline with the RWG imager. Following the stabilization
of the biosensor signal, the measurement was stopped and the buffer
was replaced with 30 μL of the coating solution and incubated
for 0.5 h while gently shaking at room temperature.30 The coating solutions were then removed and the wells were
rinsed three times with 30 μL of the assay buffer, the polymers
adsorbed to the surface irreversibly. Wells were then dosed with 30
μL assay buffer for the fourth time to establish a new baseline
for the subsequent room temperature cell spreading assay.30 HeLa cells were trypsinized with 1× prewarmed
trypsin–EDTA. Trypsin was removed before complete detachment
of HeLa cells and its activity arrested by adding culture medium containing
10% FBS.30 Harvested cells were centrifuged
at 380g for 6 min and the cell pellet was resuspended
in assay buffer with intensive pipetting. Cell suspensions and EGCG
solutions (in different concentrations) were pipetted in 1:1 ratio
into 9 eppendorf tubes (with a total volume of 340 μL in each
tubes), and they were incubated together for 3 min. Later, we centrifuged
them again for 6 min at 380g. We removed the supernatant
from the cells, and the assay buffer was added to the cells. The 20 000
treated cells/well were pipetted into the biosensor wells, without
replacing the plate from the Epic BT. Spreading was monitored until
saturation of the biosensor signals. Averaging every 5 subsequent
data points, the effective sampling rate was 1/15 s–1.3030 At the
end of the biosensor measurement, the microplate was placed under
a Zeiss Observer microscope to visually observe and image the cells
with a 20× objective (all wells were completely filled up with
assay buffer and covered with a microscope slide to improve imaging
quality by eliminating the disturbing meniscus).30 All experiments were done in triplicates in three different
wells at room temperature, and only the averaged data were used for
further processing.5,30

MTT Cell Viability Assay
HeLa cells were plated into
a 96-well plate with an initial cell number of 12 500 per well.
After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were treated with the
compound EGCG in 200 μL serum-free medium or in 200 μL
HBSS–HEPES buffer. The cells were incubated with the compounds
at 0.064 to 500 or 1000 μg/mL concentration range for 2 h. The
control cells were treated with serum-free medium only or with HBSS–HEPES
buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing the cells three times
with serum-free medium or HBSS–HEPES buffer, the viability
was determined by MTT.25 A 45 μL
MTT solution (2 mg/mL) was added to each well.42 After 3 h of incubation, the cells were centrifuged for
5 min (380g) and supernatant was removed. The obtained
formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and optical
density (OD) of the samples was measured at λ = 540 and 620
nm using enzyme-linked immunosorbent reader (iEMS Reader, Labsystems,
Finland). The OD620 values were substracted from the OD540 values. In the case of cytostatic effect determination,
the cells were cultivated for further 72 h in DMEM medium at 37 °C
after the washing steps. After 72 h, the viability was determined
by the MTT.

The percent of cytotoxicity and cytostatic effect
was calculated using the following equation 2  where ODtreated and ODcontrol correspond to the optical densities of
the treated and the control
cells, respectively. In each case, two independent experiments were
carried out with four parallel measurements. The 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values were determined from the dose–response
curves, which were defined using a MicrocalTM Origin1 (version 8.6)
software.

Flow Cytometry
Before cell plating, the plates were
coated with PP/PPR 1:1 v/v (total volume of 10 μL, shaking for
3 min, after washing with 200 μL of HBSS buffer three times).

HeLa cells (1 × 105 cells per well) were plated
in 24-well plates. The cells were stimulated with the medium alone,
or with EGCG (0.0039–1 mg/mL) solutions for 1.5 h. After treatment,
the supernatants were removed and the cells were washed with serum-free
DMEM media and then the adherent cells were treated with 100 μL
trypsin solution (Sigma, 2.5 g/L porcine trypsin solution in 0.9%
sodium chloride), trypsin digestion was blocked using HPMI buffer
(20 mM HEPES, 132 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 5
mM glucose, 1 mM CaCl2 [pH 7.4])43 supplemented with 10% (wt/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and
the cells were collected by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min and then washed twice with the serum-free HPMI buffer.
The pellets were resuspended in the HPMI buffer.

The cell viability
was assessed using 10 μg/mL PI solution
(for the gating strategy, fluorescence parameters were gated using
unstained and the PI-stained untreated control cells, and 10 000
cells were counted for each treatment). PI was excited at 488 nm,
using a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) Coherent
Sapphire, 22 mW laser. After staining, the intracellular fluorescence
intensity of the cells was measured on channel PE LP550 and the data
were analyzed with a FACSDiva 5.0 software. All measurements were
performed in triplicates.
