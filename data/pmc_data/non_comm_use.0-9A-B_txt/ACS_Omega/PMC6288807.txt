A series of triazole-substituted
quinazoline hybrid compounds were
designed and synthesized for anticancer activity targeting epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. Most of the compounds
showed moderate to good antiproliferative activity against four cancer
cell lines (HepG2, HCT116, MCF-7, and PC-3). Compound 5b showed good antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 20.71
μM) against MCF-7 cell lines. Molecular docking results showed
that compound 5b formed hydrogen bond with Met 769 and
Lys 721 and π–sulfur interaction with Met 742 of EGFR
tyrosine kinase (PDB ID: 1M17). Compound 5b decreases the expression
of EGFR and p-EGFR. It also induces apoptosis through reactive oxygen
species generation, followed by the change in mitochondrial membrane
potential.

==== Body
Introduction
Cancer is one of the
most devastating diseases in the developing
countries.1 The epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in cell survival, growth,
differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of EGFR is a common
mechanism in cancer progression especially in nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Also, overexpression of EGFR has been observed in different
types of cancers such as breast, ovarian, head and neck, colon, and
so forth.2 Some FDA-approved drugs, EGFR
inhibitors such as erlotinib3 (i), gefitinib4 (ii), icotinib5 (iii),
lapatinib6 (iv), and afatinib7 (v), are used for the treatment of the above-mentioned
cancers (Figure 1).
The interplay of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the EGFR plays
an important role in cancer progression. Excessive ROS can induce
negative responses such as growth inhibition or death of cancer cells.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is also the major mechanism inducing oxidative
stress. Higher ROS levels can trigger overoxidation of the Met residue
of EGFR T790M and shut down the EGFR downstream survival pathway.8 Therefore, direct EGFR inhibition or inhibition
of EGFR function via excessive ROS generation or both may be a feasible
therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of
some reported anticancer agents.

Side effects are major problems with the current EGFR inhibiting
anticancer drugs. For example, erlotinib significantly reduced the
levels of white blood cells, red blood cells (RBCs), and hemoglobin.
It increased liver function markers, aspartate aminotransferase and
alanine aminotransferase levels, and damaged the internal organs in
an experimental rat model.9 Similarly,
unusual hematologic complications were detected after erlotinib was
administered in patients with advanced NSCLC.10 Therefore, it is important to design new EGFR inhibitors as anticancer
agents with low toxicity on normal organs and blood cells.

Quinazoline
is an important heterocyclic moiety used in drug discovery
because of its diverse biological activities.11 Especially, 4-aminoquinazoline moiety showed good efficacy against
various cancers. The structure–activity relationship (SAR)
of EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib and lapatinib revealed a quinazoline
moiety to play an important role in antitumor activity, especially
4-aminoquinazoline moiety. 4-Aminoquinazoline moiety seemed particularly
very important for activity and showed diverse biological activities
such as anticancer,12 antitubercular,13 antimalarial,14 antileishmanial,15 and antibacterial and antifungal activities.16

1,2,3-Triazole is another important pharmacophore
in medicinal
chemistry and it can form hydrogen bonding with biological targets,17 which will be useful for the activity. Also,
triazole moiety-containing molecules (vi–ix, Figure 1) are known to show various
pharmacological activities such as anticancer,18 anti-human immunodeficiency virus,19 antitubercular,20 and anti-inflammatory21 activities. These structural features and importance
in various biological activities have made this moiety very important
in drug discovery. The fight against cancer and hence the research
to cure the disease are continuing since last many years. Many novel
therapeutics were tried, but most of them suffer from severe toxicities.
In an ongoing project in our laboratory on the discovery of new anticancer
agents,22 we were interested to make EGFR
inhibitors. Recently, molecular hybridization approach has been widely
used for the design and synthesis of small hybrid compounds for the
treatment of cancer. The approach mainly involves combining two or
more different pharmacophore moieties in a single molecule having
a common scaffold. These hybrid molecules have many advantages over
the conventional drugs such as toxicity,23 solubility, multidrug resistance, and so forth. In the present study,
we are using the molecular hybridization strategy to combine the biologically
important two scaffolds, quinazoline and 1,2,3-triazole, to get a
small set of new hybrid compounds (Figure 2). As discussed earlier, both quinazoline
and 1,2,3-triazole moieties are very important for the anticancer
activity, thus we synthesized 20 triazole-containing quinazoline hybrid
compounds and performed cytotoxicity studies and the molecular docking
studies thereafter. A lead compound was used to study EGFR inhibition,
ROS generation, and toxicity in normal cells as well as in blood cells.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis was started by converting
4-nitro-benzylbromide 1 to the corresponding azide 2 in the presence
of sodium azide in tetrahydrofuran (THF)–water in 95% yield.
Compound 2 was reacted with different mono-substituted
alkynes under classical “click” condition to produce
different triazole compounds 3 in good yields. Finally,
nitro group in 3 was reduced (Fe/NH4Cl in
ethanol and water) to the corresponding amine 4, which
was further coupled with different 4-chloro quinazolines to give the
desired target compounds (5a–5t) in 73–88%
yield (Scheme 1). All
compounds were fully characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), 13C NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR),
and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data.

Reagents and conditions: (a)

THF, different alkynes, reflux, 80 °C, 3 h, 80–85%; (c)

The average 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values
(concentration needed to inhibit cancer cell line proliferation by
50%) of the compounds (5a–5t) against four human
cancer cell lines that include HCT116 (human colorectal cancer cell
line), HEPG2 (human liver cancer cell line), MCF-7 (human breast cancer
cell line), and PC-3 (human prostate cancer cell line) were determined
using the cytotoxicity assay method. The IC50 values are
listed in Table 1,
and the marketed anticancer drug erlotinib was used as positive control.
On the basis of the cytotoxicity assay results, further efforts were
made to elucidate the SAR. All of the synthesized compounds were screened
against different cancer cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7, HCT116, and PC-3).
Results suggested that most of the compounds showed moderate to good
efficacy toward MCF-7 compared to other cell lines. Among all, compound 5b showed the best activity with an IC50 value
of 20.71 μM in MCF-7 cell lines. Moreover, it was observed that
compounds bearing the −Cl atom at the second position of quinazoline
(5b, 5e, 5h, 5k, and 5n) were better compared to other substitutions.
Surprisingly, all of the above-mentioned active compounds containing
−OMe group at the 6, 7 position of the quinazoline moiety are
resulted, strongly suggesting that the chlorine atom at the 2nd position
and −OMe group at the 6, 7 position of quinazoline are necessary
for the activity.

Table 1 Cytotoxicity Activities of Compounds 5a–5t against HepG2, MCF-7, HCT116, and PC-3 in Micromolar
The best compound 5b has an IC50 value
of 20.71 μM, which is higher than the standard compound erlotinib
(11.57 μM). Interestingly, 5b also shows lower
toxicity than erlotinib on a normal human epithelial kidney cell line
(40.32 ± 4.43 and 29.48 ± 3.32 μM), in human blood
RBC (45.6 ± 2.65 and 16.23 ± 3.23 μM), and in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (37.38 ± 3.55 and 20.46 ±
4.1 μM, respectively). Therefore, though compound 5b shows relatively low toxicity than erlotinib in cancer cells, it
has low toxicity in normal cell lines and normal blood cells. Thus,
compound 5b is expected to be a better drug candidate
than erlotinib. Gratifyingly, compound 5b also has 4-amino
quinazoline moiety as the pharmacophore similar to that of erlotinib
and gefitinib, and we thought that compound 5b shows
anticancer activity through the EGFR-mediated pathway. For this study,
we selected the crystal structure (PDB ID: 1M17)24 of EGFR
tyrosine kinase for the molecular modeling study. To study the interaction
between EGFR tyrosine kinase and triazole-substituted quinazoline
hybrid derivatives, molecular docking of the EGFR protein (PDB ID: 1M17) and compound 5b using discovery studio software was performed. Discovery
studio was used for the visualization of interaction of the target
molecule with EGFR tyrosine kinase. Docking results showed that compound 5b goes and binds in the adenosine 5′-triphosphate
(ATP)-binding pocket of 1M17 and showed two hydrogen bonding interactions with
N1 of quinazoline with the main-chain NH group of Met 769 at a distance
of 3.13 Å and triazole N2 with Lys 721 in the ATP-binding pocket
at a distance of 3.04 Å. Both erlotinib and compound 5b go and bind in the same ATP-binding pocket of EGFR tyrosine kinase
(1M17, Figure 3).

(3D) and two-dimensional (2D) representation of molecular docking

erlotinib in the ATP-binding pocket of EGFR tyrosine kinase.

Compound 5b also showed other interactions such
as
halogen interaction with Gln 767, π–alkyl interaction
with Leu 694, Leu 820, and Cys 751, and π–sulfur interaction
with Met 742. Erlotinib was used as the reference compound, which
also formed a similar H-bond with Met 769 at a distance of 2.85 Å.

EGFR is an important signaling network in the case of cell proliferation,
adhesion, migration, and survival. In order to study the mechanism
of triazole-substituted quinazoline hybrids, we investigated the effect
of compound 5b on the EGFR signaling pathway in MCF-7
cell lines using western blot analysis.25 After treatment with compound 5b in MCF-7 cell lines,
the level of EGFR and p-EGFR decreases with different time intervals
of 12 and 24 h (Figure 4). In this experiment, erlotinib was used as positive control. These
results confirmed that the antiproliferative effect of compound 5b in MCF-7 cell lines is mainly due to the decrease of EGFR
and phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream process. EGFR inhibition
leads to the activation of ROS generation, which leads to DNA damage
and cell death. Cellular generation of ROS is an important factor
of apoptotic cell death. We have examined here the status of ROS generation
by compound 5b. The maximum ROS generation was observed
at 24 h after the treatment of MCF-7 cells with compound 5b. Also, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) mean intensity was 765 in control cells but 1683 in compound 5b (20.71 μM) treated cells after 24 h, indicating a
shift in FITC mean intensity from the control cells to the cells treated
with compound 5b. These results demonstrated that compound 5b (20.71 μM) inducing apoptosis in MCF-7 cells at 12
and 24 h might proceed via the ROS-mediated pathway.26

with compound 5b and erlotinib (positive control).

Apoptosis is the desired way of
cancer cell death. To determine
the effect of compound 5b on apoptosis, fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) was performed on MCF-7 cell lines treated with
compound 5b at different time intervals.27 At the initial stage of apoptosis, phosphatidyl serine
is exposed from inside cell membrane to outside and this can bind
with annexin V. After treatment of MCF-7 cells with compound 5b (20.71 μM) at time points (0, 12, and 24 h), MCF-7
cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) and
monitored by flow cytometry. It was observed that early apoptosis
rates increased from 5.9 to 24.6% and the late apoptosis rates increased
from 0.7 to 14.2%. The results showed that compound 5b increased cellular apoptosis in a time-dependent manner (Figure 5). Flow cytometric
analysis of control cells revealed that 84.4% of the cell population
exhibited fluorescence at the PE-Texas Red A channel, indicating a
higher level of cells having a healthy ΔΨm,
whereas compound 5b (20.71 μM) treated cells at
24 h revealed that 29.5% of the cell population exhibited fluorescence
at the PE-Texas Red A channel, which showed a loss of ΔΨm in 54.9% of cell population after 24 h.28 These results indicate that compound 5b might
induce apoptosis by generation of ROS via the mitochondrial pathway
as it leads to lowering of mitochondrial membrane potential.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of triazole-substituted
quinazoline hybrid
molecules were designed and synthesized as anticancer agents. The
results showed that most of the compounds had moderate to good antiproliferative
effects against four different cell lines HCT116, HepG2, PC-3, and
MCF-7. Among them, compound 5b showed good antiproliferative
effects against MCF-7 cell lines. Molecular docking studies showed
that compound 5b formed hydrogen bond with Met 769 of
the EGFR protein, which regulates the conformation of EGFR which is
responsible for antiproliferative activity. Compound 5b decreased the expression of EGFR and p-EGFR in MCF-7 cell lines,
from which we can conclude that compound 5b exhibits
antiproliferative effects in MCF-7 cell lines through the EGFR signaling
pathway. Compound 5b also caused change in mitochondrial
membrane potential and ROS-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cell lines.
From the above results, it may be concluded that compound 5b acts as the EGFR inhibitor and can be used in the treatment of cancer.
Further optimization of the structure to show improved EGFR inhibitory
and antiproliferative activity is ongoing in the laboratory.

General Experimental
Procedures for Biological Studies
Cytotoxicity Assay
Exponentially growing cells were
seeded into 96-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells per well. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were
treated with all compounds in different concentrations in triplicates.
The cells were incubated for another 24 h. A 20 μL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide solution (5 mg/mL) was added to all wells and incubated for
4 h at 37 °C. The solution was discarded, and the insoluble dark
blue crystals (formazan) were dissolved in 40 μL DMSO. After
15 min, the absorbance was measured using an ELISA reader at a wavelength
of 595 nm. The IC50 of all compounds is the concentration
(μg/mL) of the compound at which there was 50% growth inhibition
with respect to the control culture in different cell lines.

Analysis
of Cellular apoptosis
Apoptosis was assayed
by using an annexin-V FITC apoptosis detection kit (Calbiochem, CA,
USA). Briefly, cells were treated with or without the compounds in
a time-dependent manner (0, 12, and 24 h) and then washed and stained
with PI and annexin-V-FITC in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. The percentages of live, apoptotic, and necrotic cells
were determined by the flow cytometric method (Becton Dickinson, San
Jose, CA, USA). Data from 1 × 106 cells were analyzed
for each sample.

Measurement of ROS
ROS generation
was measured by dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCF-DA). After treatment with the compounds for the time
periods (0, 12, and 24 h), the cells were incubated with 10 μM
DCF-DA at 37 °C for 20 min. Then cell pellets were suspended
in 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were analyzed at
an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 525
nm by FACSCalibur flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA,
USA).

Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (JC1 Assay)
MCF-7 cells were seeded for 24 h and then treated with and without
compounds in a time-dependent manner (0, 12, and 24 h). Cells were
washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with JC-1 dye (5
μg/mL) in darkness for 20 min at room temperature (37 °C).
Emission was determined by the flow cytometric method (Becton Dickinson,
San Jose, CA, USA) at 525 nm.

Western Blot
Treated
or untreated cells were collected
and lysed. Lysates (30 μg of protein per well) were separated
by electrophoresis in 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
and electrotransferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes using
a Trans-Blot system (Trans Blot wet transfer; Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine
serum albumin in TBST (tris buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20,
pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, membranes
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody
for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence
using tetramethylbenzidine as the substrate. β-Actin was used
as the loading control.
