Lithium metal is a leading candidate
for next-generation electrochemical
energy storage and therefore a key material for the future sustainable
energy economy. Lithium has a high specific energy, low toxicity,
and relatively favorable abundance. The majority of lithium production
originates from salt lakes and is based on long (>12 months) periods
of evaporation to concentrate the lithium salt, followed by molten
electrolysis. Purity requires separation from base metals (Na, K,
Ca, Mg, etc.), which is a time-consuming, energy-intensive process,
with little control over the microstructure. Here, we show how a membrane-mediated
electrolytic cell can be used to produce lithium thin films (5–30
μm) on copper substrates at room temperature. Purity with respect
to base metals content is extremely high. The cell design allows an
aqueous solution to be a continuous feedstock, advocating a quick,
low-energy-consumption, one-step-to-product process. The film morphology
is controlled by varying the current densities in a narrow window
(1–10 mA/cm2), to produce uniform nanorods, spheres,
and cubes, with significant influence over the physical and electrochemical
properties.

Introduction
Safe rechargeable batteries
with higher specific energy are crucial
for a wide variety of applications,1−7 and lithium metal is one of the most attractive anodes because it
is the lightest and most electropositive metal, possessing a theoretical
specific coulometric capacity (3860 mAh/g) 10 times greater than that
of the graphite anodes used in lithium-ion batteries (372 mAh/g),
a density of 0.59 g/cm3, and a high negative reduction
potential of −3.040 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode.6,8−12 The emergence of lithium battery technologies, for which a range
of electrolytes and cathodes is contemplated, has been hailed as the
likeliest group of successors to the current multibillion dollar lithium-ion
battery paradigm.13 Such technologies include
lithium–sulfur14−16 and lithium–air/oxygen configurations.17−19 A major problem that emerges when lithium metal anodes are cycled
is the growth of dendrites.3,8,12,20−24 The passage of current through these structures can
short the battery or cause catastrophic failure.23 Efforts to prevent dendrite growth have primarily focused
on blocking these protrusions.8,16,20,22,25−27 Li dendrite growth has been shown to stem from impurities
in the Li metal electrode, which facilitate the nucleation of subsurface
dendritic structures, and removal of such impurities can inhibit dendrite
growth, although the exact impurity that catalyzes dendrite growth
remains unclear.10 What is clear, however,
is that producing lithium with greater control over purity and morphology
will be critical for the success of energy storage technologies built
from a lithium anode platform.

About 75% of current lithium
production originates from brines
in the salars-evaporite basins (dried salt lakes) in the high Andes
of Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia.28 This
lithium is highly diluted, requiring extensive extraction operations
and a copious water supply. It is then concentrated through solar
evaporation (18–24 months). The base metal contaminants depend
on the original brine content, typically Na, K, Ca, and Mg, with Na
being a major impurity of around 1%.29 Lithium
metal with purities in the range of 99.5–99.99% can be subsequently
manufactured using electrowinning from molten eutectic LiCl–KCl
salt electrolysis at around 500 °C.30 The energy requirements (35–40 kWh kg-Li), combined with
the production of anhydrous lithium chloride feedstock, make for an
energy-intensive process.31 Producing high-purity
lithium metal at the level suitable for energy storage technology
(>99.99%) is therefore challenging. For development into form factors
suitable as electrodes, the lithium is extruded from an ingot into
a foil typically limited to thicknesses above 100 μm and often
prepared as a lithium–aluminum alloy foil, to maintain mechanical
strength. There are inherent difficulties associated with preparing
extruded thin lithium metal films <100 μm, with little possibility
for control over microstructure. An alternative, that of a pure thin
film-on-substrate, would be highly desirable for next-generation battery
researchers and lithium metal battery manufacturers alike.

Here,
we demonstrate the ability of producing high-purity (with
respect to metals content) lithium thin films in a variety of highly
uniform and tunable morphologies at room temperature by an electrolytic
cell. Dendrite-free thin films of high purity with respect to base
metal contaminants are electrolytically deposited on a copper anode.
The method is a low energy consumption approach when compared to the
existing lithium manufacturing process. The cell design relies on
a lithium-ion conducting solid-state membrane to transport Li+ ions from an aqueous mineral solution (lithium carbonate
or other suitable lithium containing feedstock) to an organic conducting
electrolyte in the absence of additives.32−36 The morphology of the lithium can be precisely tuned
as a function of current density in an extremely narrow window (1–10
mA/cm2). The morphologies produced are spheres, cubes,
and, most significantly, rods—an array of uniform, self-aligned,
tightly packed, perpendicularly oriented rods with diameters of 300
nm. Purity and structural characterization of the three Li metal film
morphologies (self-aligned nanorods, spheres, and nanocubes) were
characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). To evaluate the electrochemical
performance of the different Li metal film morphologies for Li-ion
batteries, two-electrode cells, in the form of standard CR-2032 coin-type
cells, were fabricated and compared to Li metal foil as a standard.
The rods, with lengths in excess of microns (10–200 μm),
give rise to smooth films of lithium with an iridescent blue color.
Microscopy of the rodlike array is reminiscent of the arrangement
of chitin in morpho butterfly wings, the cause of structural coloration
and their blue color. We present and advocate an additive-free method
to produce high-purity lithium suitable for electrochemical applications,
including energy storage, in which pure, dendrite-free electrodes
with morphological control over a small range of current densities
can be accomplished in one step (Figure 1).

and three-dimensional
of the electrochemical cell.

Results and Discussion
To evaluate the purity of the electrodeposited
lithium metal, samples
were analyzed independently by Intertek (Intertek Group PLC) for ICP-MS.
The lithium purity was determined to be 99.985 wt % against a scan
of 69 isotopes, 99.996 wt % on a metal basis. A complete list of the
elements scanned and their concentration is presented in Table S1, Supporting Information. The major impurities
in the film were silicon (69 ppmw), sulfur (19 ppmw), sodium (13 ppmw),
and phosphorus (10 ppmw). The source of silicon impurities is systemic:
it is known for ICP-MS and confirmed by Intertek that the silicon-rich
environment of the ICP torch regularly causes significant background
problems in the analysis. Consequently, the reported silicon concentration
is unreliable because of these high background levels. The small amount
of sulfur likely stems from the Cu foil pretreatment step, where trace
amounts of sulfuric acid might have adsorbed onto the Cu surface.
Phosphorus contaminants are from the LiPF6 salt in the
organic electrolyte solution that was not completely removed from
dimethyl carbonate (DMC) rinse after deposition.

By controlling
the lithium deposition rates, distinct morphologies
of deposited Li can be prepared, as shown in Figure 2A–C. The deposition rates of −3,
−5, and −7 mA/cm2 formed Li rods, spheres,
and cubes respectively. The low-magnification images (Figure 2) show uniform structures,
which is consistent across the entire 3 cm × 3 cm electrode surface.
The electrochemically deposited films deposited at −3 mA/cm2 form self-aligned, highly compacted nanorods with hemispherical
tips with diameter of about 300 nm. See also Figure S1, Supporting Information. The Li spheres, deposited at −5
mA/cm2, exhibited a higher surface roughness and an average
particle size of ∼1 μm. The Li cubes, deposited at −7
mA/cm2, had an average size of ∼100 nm. This is
a somewhat unique observation of electrodeposited Li metal with sphere
and cube morphologies, and of self-aligned rod morphologies without
any additives.5,6

Li films on 9 cm2 copper foil under different conditions:
(A) rods, (B) spheres, (C)
cubelike morphology. In the case of the rods, a fractured zone was
imaged to illustrate the extent of depth and aspect ratio.

The deposition of relatively thick layers of highly
crystalline
Li metal is further confirmed in the XRD pattern, by a sharp peak
at 35.9° 2θ (PDF #15-0401), as shown in Figure 3. It also shows the formation
of low-crystalline LiF, expected to be a part of the solid–electrolyte
interphase (SEI) layer, defined by broad peaks of low intensities
at 38.7 and 45.0° 2θ (PDF #04-0857). No sign of lithium
oxidation is found in the initial material. LiF is thought to play
a critical role in the formation of nanorods.8,37 Following
exposure to air during the XRD measurement, the sample begins to oxidize,
visible in the diffractograms taken after 15 and 30 min of exposure
(Figure 3). An expected
reaction with air moisture results in the formation of LiOH (peaks
at 32.4, 35.6, and 51.4° 2θ PDF #32-0564) as a hydrolyzation
product, following the reaction 2Li + 2H2O → 2LiOH
+ H2. The intensity of LiOH peaks increases with longer
exposure times. The hydrolysis is ultimately observed visually by
the reactive lithium film turning white. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) is a proven powerful technique in the characterization and compositional
analysis of electrode materials, including electrochemically deposited
lithium.38,39 To acquire complementary information about
the nonmetal contents, understand the composition of the solid–electrolyte
interphase (SEI) layer, and estimate the SEI layer thickness, high-resolution
XPS spectra were recorded for Li rod films (Figure 4A,B). Samples of freshly deposited lithium
films were rapidly transferred from inert atmospheres to the XPS chamber
to minimize the effect of air exposure. XPS was then recorded on pristine
samples, followed by Ar+ sputtering to obtain depth profile
information regarding the film from the surface (0 nm), down to 700
nm with successive intervals. Nonsputtered, pristine samples reveal
the presence of Li as the main element, together with four impurities—F,
O, C, and P (Figure 5a,c). Two of them—C and P, which originate from the organic
solvent and electrolyte (or their decomposition products)—completely
disappear after the Ar+ sputtering of the topmost 10 nm
of the film, suggesting localization of these elements to the film
surface (Figure S2, Supporting Information).
XPS analysis is able to reveal detailed information regarding the
nature and composition of the film: peak deconvolution of the first
scan in the Li 1s region shows that the lithium metal (Li0) signal appears prior to Ar+ sputtering, suggesting an
SEI layer thickness of <10 nm (Figure 4A). The top surface layer consists of lithiated
products of decomposed DMC (viz. CH3OLi, CH3COOLi), organic electrolyte salts (viz. LiPF6, LiPOxFy), LiF, and LiOH.
The presence of LiOH is most likely due to the reaction of Li metal
with water vapors when it is exposed to air during the transfer to
XPS machine. No evidence of pure DMC on the lithium surface was found
in the C 1s region (see Figure S1, Supporting
Information), indicating (i) complete DMC removal upon vacuum drying
at −30 psi in the glovebox antechamber, and/or (ii) post reaction
of DMC with Li at the surface. After sputtering, LiF and LiOH are
the main impurities observed in the sample. The XPS spectra in the
O 1s region also reveal the presence of Li2O (Figure 5a), which may be
due to the exposure of LiOH to high-energy Ar+ sputtering
beams, following the reaction 2LiOH → heating → Li2O + H2O, and therefore the presence of Li2O may be due to the analysis procedure. It is therefore deduced that
fluorine is the major impurity for the electrolytically deposited
lithium film in a H2O/O2-free environment. Considering
the observation of two separate crystalline structures of Li and LiF,
as evidenced by XRD and XPS, and consistent amounts of LiF through
the sample, we suggest that lithium rods are formed by a pure lithium
metal enveloped by a thin layer (<10 nm) of LiF. This layer is
expected to act as a barrier, preventing Li rods from growing in and
keeping them aligned in parallel.14 When
used as an electrode for energy storage applications, the LIF may
also play a beneficial role in the context of Li-ion conductivity,
acting as a protective layer against formation of the SEI layer due
to electrode exposure to organic electrolyte and preventing dendrite
growth upon cycling.9 Similar qualitative
results were obtained for the film of Li spheres, but with a thicker
SEI layer—up to 40 nm (assuming a sputtering rate of 4 nm/min;
see Figure S3, Supporting Information).
A Li0 signal appeared only after the first sputtering.
Moreover, C and P elements were found even after 21 min of sputtering
(∼84 nm in depth). It should be noted that these results might
be affected by surface roughness of the film, which causes nonuniform
exposure to the ion beam and, consequently, uneven etching of the
film.

Figure 5 Galvanostatic charge/discharge capacities of
composite graphite
versus commercial lithium foil (black) and lithium films of different
morphologies, spheres (blue) and rods (red).

To demonstrate the applicability of the lithium films and
their
morphologies, preliminary electrochemical testing was conducted. It
was anticipated and observed that precise control over lithium morphology
during deposition and growth can affect coulometric capacity. As a
preliminary investigation of performance, the electrolytically deposited
lithium films were tested using an asymmetric Li|C coin cell (see Experimental Section for cell preparation details).
Capacity/cycling was analyzed using C-rate. Current density was estimated
to be 2.2 mA/cm2 for 1C. At 0.1C, the gravimetric capacity
of composite graphite versus lithium rods yielded a 1st cycle capacity
of ∼258 mAh/g and a reversible capacity of 100 mAh/g at the
8th cycle, showing around 3 times better performance than lithium
spheres and commercial lithium foil (both showed a reversible capacity
of ∼35 mAh/g) tested under the same conditions. This is in
good agreement with previous theoretical studies and experimental
results, which suggest higher predicted values for rod-structured
films compared to those obtained for smooth films.14 Similar trends in performance were observed at a higher
cycling rate of 0.2C, 3 times higher capacity if lithium rods are
used as a anode when compared to a commercial foil or the lithium
spheres. At an increased C-rate of 0.5, the capacity of all three
coin cells dropped down to 5 mAh/g. This could be due to a limitation
on Li-ion diffusion (insufficient time for ions to intercalate graphite),
which leads to redox reactions occurring mainly at the interface of
the graphite electrode/electrolyte. Upon decreasing the cycle rate
back to 0.1C, performance of the coin cell with Li rods was recovered
up to 76 mAh/g, but gradually decreased down to 13 mAh/h and stabilized
after the 40th cycle. In the case of Li spheres and commercial foil,
the capacities were completely recovered and relatively stable up
to ∼50 cycles. It is noted that the components used to construct
the cells were not of the best choice for testing graphite as the
working electrode (for instance, 1 M electrolyte solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/DMC/diethyl carbonate (DEC) in
4:2:4 by volume ratio is optimized to be used in manganese oxide batteries).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have prepared lithium thin films at room temperature
by an electrolytic cell. The morphology of the lithium can be precisely
tuned as a function of current density in an extremely narrow window
(1–10 mA/cm2). Dendrite-free thin films of high
purity with respect to base metal contaminants are electrolytically
deposited on a copper anode. The cell design relies on a lithium-ion
conducting solid-state membrane to transport Li+ ions from
an aqueous mineral solution (lithium carbonate or other suitable lithium
containing feedstock) to an organic conducting electrolyte in the
absence of additives. The most significant morphology is an array
of uniform, self-aligned, perpendicularly oriented rods with diameters
of ∼300 nm that give rise to smooth films of lithium with an
iridescent blue color.

Experimental Section
Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns
were recorded with a D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Corporation, Cillerica, MA) using Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) with 0.01° 2θ
steps. SEM analysis was performed on a Zeiss Supra 50 VP (Carl Zeiss
SMT AG, Oberkochen, Germany) using an accelerating voltage of 3 kV.
Quantitative elemental analysis was performed by Intertek using a
Thermo Scientific Element 2 SF-ICP-MS. Sample solutions were transported
to the ICP torch using a PFA cyclonic spray chamber configured with
a PFA Meinhard nebulizer and a 2.0 mm alumina injector. A scan of
69 isotopes was performed. The instrument calibration standards for
ICP-optical emission spectrometry analysis were matrix matched to
the samples prepared for analysis. The quantitative trace analysis
routine consisted of eight standards prepared in the range of 0.1–20
parts per billion to bracket the suspected levels in the sample. The
calibration standards were prepared using Inorganic Ventures milligram
per liter (10 mg/L) multielement and single-element stock standards.
The samples of lithium deposited on copper sheets were transferred
to 100 mL beakers containing aliquots of chilled deionized water.
After the lithium dissolved, the aliquots were combined into a 50
mL graduated tube. The sample was diluted to 50 mL with deionized
water. Concentrated nitric acid (0.5 mL) was added to the sample.
XPS analysis of lithium rods on copper substrates was performed using
a PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer (Physical Electronics Inc.) employing
a 200 μm monochromatic Al Kα X-ray beam with an operating
pressure of ∼2 × 10–9 Torr. The emitted
photoelectrons were collected using a 180° hemispherical electron
energy analyzer. Samples were analyzed at a 45° takeoff angle
between the sample surface and the path to the analyzer. High-resolution
spectra were taken at a pass energy of 50 eV and with a step size
of 0.8 eV for survey and 0.05 eV for high-resolution regions. A beam
of 5 kV argon ions was used for sputtering the top layers of the samples.
The peak fitting was carried out using CasaXPS version 2.3.16 RP 1.6.

Electrochemical Testing
To evaluate the electrochemical
performance of the produced lithium films as anode materials for secondary
battery applications, two-electrode cells, in the form of standard
CR-2032 coin-type cells (MTI Corporation, Richmond, CA), were assembled
in an Ar-filled glovebox. The produced lithium metal films of different
morphologies (spheres, rods, and cubes) were compared to commercial
lithium foil (99.9%, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA). Composite graphite,
single coated on copper foil (loading of ≈60 g/m2; MTI, Richmond, CA), was used as the working electrode. A 25 μm
trilayer polypropylene–polyethylene–polypropylene membrane
(Celgard LLC, Charlotte, NC) was used as the separator material. Then,
1 M LiPF6 solution in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC),
DMC, and diethyl carbonate (DEC) in 4:2:4 by volume ratio (MTI, Richmond,
CA) was used as the battery electrolyte solution. The coin cells were
tested in the galvanostatic mode within the voltage range of 0.01–1.5
V versus Li, using an eight-channel battery cycler (BST8-MA, MTI,
Richmond, CA). To estimate current density, graphite capacity was
calculated to be 2.232 mAh/cm2 (60 g/m2, 373
mAh/g). The electrode area, based on 15 mm diameter, was 1.77 cm2, with 0.752π2.232 = 3.94 mAh capacity. Hence,
C would be ∼4 mA and 1C would be a current density of (3.94/1.77)
= 2.2 mA/cm2.

Electrolytic Deposition of Lithium Films
Electrolytic
deposition of lithium metal was carried out using an electrolytic
cell, the schematic of which is depicted in Figure 1.40 The cell comprises
a stainless steel counter electrode (anode), a copper foil working
electrode (cathode), and a lithium-ion conducting glass ceramic membrane
of the form Li1+x+3zAlx(Ti,Ge)2–xSi3zP3–zO12 (LIC-GC, Ohara Corporation), which separates
the two electrodes and electrolyte solutions. A 125 μm-thick
copper foil (Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd, England) was used as a cathode
and, simultaneously, the substrate for lithium metal deposition. Lithium
hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) solution in dimethyl carbonate
(DMC, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used as the organic electrolyte.
An aqueous electrolyte, circulating through the anode compartment
of the cell, was prepared by dissolving lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) in sulfuric acid solution. Electrolytic deposition
was conducted at room temperature using a potentiostat/galvanostat
power supply (Reference 3000, Gamry Instruments, Warminster, PA),
with aqueous electrolyte continuously circulating through the cell.
Lithium metal films were prepared under galvanostatic conditions,
a current between −1 and −10 mA/cm2 was chosen,
depending on the desired lithium film morphology.
