Introduction
Phthalocyanines (Pcs),
that is, planar 18 π-electron aromatic
compounds that consist of four isoindoline units, are well-known functional
dyes, whose unique electronic and optical properties have led to applications
in advanced materials such as dye-sensitized solar cells, photodynamic
therapy drugs, catalysts for organic reactions, chemical sensors,
and electronic devices.1 In the interest
of industrial applications, control over the aggregation of Pc macrocycles
is of prime importance, as aggregated Pcs exhibit low solubility and
less attractive optical properties.2 For
the last decade, our group has been interested in trifluoroethoxy-substituted
Pcs (TFEO-Pcs),3 as these show outstanding
stability and solubility in various organic solvents as well as nonaggregation
properties because of the presence of the highly lipophilic trifluoroethoxy
(TFEO) group at their peri-positions. The purely nonaggregation properties
of the TFEO-Pcs lead to sharp Q-bands, which are attractive for applications
in chemical sensors in terms of clarity and responsivity.4 During our research on the design, synthesis,
and spectral properties of TFEO-Pcs and their derivatives,3 we noticed that TFEO-Pcs are extremely sensitive
toward their protonation in solvents (Figure 1a).5 The UV–vis
spectra of TFEO-Pcs are highly solvent- and concentration-dependent,
which can be observed even by the naked eye. The protonation of Pcs
has been well investigated because protonated Pcs are expected to
find applications in various areas because of their electronic properties,
which include absorption, fluorescence, aggregation, and photochemical
features upon protonation.4b,6 Although the protonation
of Pcs regularly requires acids, TFEO-Pcs are spontaneously protonated,
even in neutral chlorinated solvents such as chloroform.5 Thus, TFEO-Pcs exhibit a very high susceptibility
for the acceptance of protons via the nitrogen atom at the meso-position
(Figure 1b), which
is increased by the influence of the TFEO group at the α-position.6g Even though it is possible in some cases to
visually examine solvent acidity because of drastic color changes,
we describe herein the response of TFEO-Pcs to protons quantitatively,
which allows applications in super-sensitive proton sensors. In addition
to this experimental investigation, these phenomena were investigated
theoretically using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Results and Discussion
To create a reference frame for protonated
TFEO-Pcs, we initially
investigated the UV–vis spectra of four A4-type
Pcs, that is, 16TFEO-Pc,3g,78TFEO-Pc, 4TFEO-Pc, and tBu-Pc(8) upon
addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in trifluorotoluene (Figure 2, Table 1, and Figure S11). In the absence of TFA, 16TFEO-Pc, 8TFEO-Pc, 4TFEO-Pc, and tBu-Pc exhibit maximum absorption wavelengths
(λ0) at 711.5, 712.5, 690.0, and 677.5 nm, respectively.
Upon addition of TFA, the maximum absorption wavelengths of all Pcs
were shifted bathochromically over two steps, depending on the concentration
of TFA. The corresponding peaks (λ1 and λ2) were attributed to the monoprotonated and diprotonated Pcs,
respectively. Interestingly, the values for the wavelength shift of 16TFEO-Pc (Δλ1 = 57.5 nm), 8TFEO-Pc (Δλ1 = 59.0 nm), and 4TFEO-Pc (Δλ1 = 46.0 nm) are larger than that of tBu-Pc (Δλ1 = 22.0 nm). These results suggest that the interaction between
the TFEO substituents at the α-position with the proton at the
meso-position affects the peak shift. Subsequently, we determined
the equilibrium constants (K) between the nonprotonated
Pcs and the monoprotonated Pc (Pc+-H) by titration, and
the results are summarized in Table 1. Among all compounds examined, 8TFEO-Pc exhibits the largest value of K (15.1 × 105 M–1), whereas that of 4TFEO-Pc (K = 7.62 × 105 M–1) decreases by reducing the number of TFEO substituents at the α-position.
Although the number of TFEO substituents at the α-position does
not change, the K value of 16TFEO-Pc (1.70 × 105 M–1) also decreases
because of the strong electronegativity of the fluorine atom. The K value of tBu-Pc (1.61 × 105 M–1),
which does not contain any TFEO substituents, is the smallest among
all compounds examined. Accordingly, 8TFEO-Pc is the
most sensitive toward protonation and exhibits the most drastic changes
to its UV–vis spectrum upon protonation.

With this protonation reference
frame in hand, the concentration-dependent
(1.0 × 10–6 to 1.0 × 10–4 M) UV–vis spectra of 16TFEO-Pc, 8TFEO-Pc, and tBu-Pc were recorded (Figures 3 and S12). The absorption spectra
of 16TFEO-Pc and 8TFEO-Pc in chloroform
show two peaks for the protonated state and nonprotonated state in
the Q band region. Thus, the protonation should be due to proton-containing
impurities (e.g., HCl) in chloroform. Furthermore, we noticed that
the peaks for the protonated states increase with decreasing concentration
of the compounds (16TFEO-Pc: log εmax = 4.42–5.23; 8TFEO-Pc: log εmax = 4.85–5.16) as the abundance ratio of protons in chloroform
increases relative to the quantity of the compound. Simultaneously,
the peaks of the nonprotonated states decrease (16TFEO-Pc: log εmax = 5.17–4.73; 8TFEO-Pc: log εmax = 5.03–4.71). A similar protonation
behavior was observed in dichloromethane, whereas such phenomena did
not occur in 1,4-dioxane, toluene, or trifluorotoluene. The protonation
of 8TFEO-Pc was saturated (1.0 × 10–5 M) at a higher concentration than that of 16TFEO-Pc (6.0 × 10–6 M). This result suggests that
the basicity of 8TFEO-Pc is more suitable for the detection
of protons than that of 16TFEO-Pc. On the other hand, tBu-Pc was only
partially protonated at low concentrations, which suggests desirable
basicity for Pcs that contain TFEO substituents at the α-position.

UV–vis spectra of (a) 16TFEO-Pc and (b) 8TFEO-Pc in chloroform.

Subsequently, we measured the steady-state fluorescence spectra
of 8TFEO-Pc in different organic solvents (Figure 4). The fluorescence spectra
show only one emission band, which was attributed to nonprotonated 8TFEO-Pc, in 1,4-dioxane (725 nm), toluene (725 nm), and trifluorotoluene
(717 nm). In chloroform, on the other hand, two emission bands corresponding
to nonprotonated 8TFEO-Pc (718 nm) and protonated 8TFEO-Pc (775 nm) were observed, and these disappeared upon
addition of pyridine. Furthermore, the peak for protonated 8TFEO-Pc was also observed in trifluorotoluene containing 1 vol % of hexafluoroisopropanol
(HFIP). In the case of pure HFIP as the solvent, a new peak was observed
at a longer wavelength (815 nm). These results demonstrate that a
protonation at the meso-position affects not only the UV–vis
but also the fluorescence properties.

PhCF3 (green), toluene (orange), chloroform (pink), HFIP
(sky blue), PhCF3 with 1 vol % of HFIP (yellow-green),
and chloroform with 1 vol % of pyridine (red).

To investigate potential applications in proton sensors,
the UV–vis
spectra of 8TFEO-Pc containing 1 vol % of various additives
were measured. We discovered that the solvent colors change according
to the pH value of the additive (Figure 5). When ethanol (EtOH) was added, the peak
of the nonprotonated 8TFEO-Pc increased slightly (Figure 5c). When trifluoroethanol
(TFE) was added, the spectrum did not change (Figure 5d). The addition of HFIP and acetic acid
(AcOH) afforded yellow-green solutions and an intense peak for monoprotonated 8TFEO-Pc (Figure 5e,f). When TFA was added, the peak of diprotonated 8TFEO-Pc (816 nm) was observed and the solution turned purple (Figure 5g). When trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid (TfOH) was added, the solution of 8TFEO-Pc turned
blue (Figure 5h) and
a precipitate of multiprotonated 8TFEO-Pc was obtained.
Moreover, when pyridine was added, the peak of the protonated 8TFEO-Pc disappeared and only one Q band of nonprotonated 8TFEO-Pc was observed. This reversible pH-dependent color
change is suitable for applications in proton sensors.

To examine such potential applications in proton sensors
further,
the UV–vis spectra of 8TFEO-Pc were measured using
chloroform from different commercial sources (Figure 6). 8TFEO-Pc was partially protonated
at low concentration in extremely pure chloroform from Sigma-Aldrich,
which uses amylene stabilizers (Figure 6a). In contrast, chloroform obtained from KANTO (Figure 6c) and TCI for high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Figure 6e) is of lower purity and afforded yellow-green solutions,
indicative of high levels of monoprotonated 8TFEO-Pc.
On the other hand, EtOH-stabilized chloroform from Sigma-Aldrich (Figure 6b) and Kishida (Figure 6d) did not suggest
any protonation of 8TFEO-Pc. In addition, the color of
the 8TFEO-Pc solutions did not change in chloroform (Figure 6f) that was distilled
from KANTO (Figure 6c). Consequently, 8TFEO-Pc is able to visualize slight
differences of the solvent conditions.

To further examine the color change upon protonation, we
carried
out DFT calculations using the SPARTAN 14 program, whereby a nonsubstituted
Pc was used as a model compound. The energies of the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO),
and the LUMO + 1 of Pc and the protonated Pcs were calculated at the
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory,9 and
the results are summarized in Table 2 (further details of the calculations are shown in Figure S14). Although the LUMO is twofold degenerate
in the nonprotonated state, these orbitals split into two unoccupied
molecular orbitals with stabilization energy upon protonation because
of its unsymmetrical structure. Although there should be two isomers
in the deprotonated state, that is, an “adjacent” protonated
state and an “opposite” protonated state, only the latter
was used for the calculations, given its stabilization (adjacent state:
−9 050 325.94 kJ/mol vs opposite state: −9 050 337.26
kJ/mol). It should also be noted that the orbital energy level was
stabilized upon protonation. Furthermore, the energy gap between the
LUMO and the HOMO decreases with increasing number of protons added
except for the triprotonated state.

Subsequently, time dependent (TD)-DFT calculations
at the ωB97X-D/6-31G(d,p)
level of theory10 were carried out to examine
the bathochromic shift of the Q-band upon protonation (Table 3). The results of these theoretical
calculations agree nicely with the experimental observations, that
is, the calculated absorption wavelength for the HOMO → LUMO
transition increased with the number of protons added.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated
that A4-type Pcs that contain TFEO
substituents at the α-position are sensitive to the presence
of protons. These Pc derivatives can reversibly accept protons that
exist in solution, resulting in a color change of the solution according
to the acidity of the solution. Especially, 8TFEO-Pc is
super sensitive to protons, which allows distinguishing chloroform
samples from different commercial suppliers. Such Pc derivatives should
thus be expected to find applications in proton sensors.

Experimental
Section
General Information
All reactions were performed in
oven-dried glassware under a positive pressure of nitrogen. The solvents
were transferred via a syringe and were introduced into the reaction
vessels though a rubber septum. All solvents were purified by a standard
method. All of the reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) carried out on a 0.25 mm Merck silica gel (60-F254). The TLC plates were visualized with UV light and 7% phosphomolybdic
acid or KMnO4 in water/heat. Column chromatography was
carried out on a column packed with silica gel (60N spherical neutral
size 50–63 μm). The 1H NMR (300, 700 MHz), 19F NMR (282 MHz), and 13C NMR (176 MHz) spectra
for the solution in acetone-d6 (δ
2.05 ppm for 1H NMR, δ 206.26 ppm for 13C NMR) were recorded on Varian Mercury 300 and JEOL 700 NMR spectrometers.
Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm downfield from internal
C6F6 (−162.2 ppm) for 19F
NMR. UV–vis spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-530 spectrometer.
IR spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-200 spectrometer. Fluorescence
spectra were recorded on a JASCO FP-6200 fluorospectrometer. Matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI–TOF) mass
spectra were taken on Shimadzu AXIMA CFR Plus. Chloroforms for UV–vis
spectra were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich for ACS spectroscopy using
amylene stabilizers (purity ≥ 99.8%), Sigma-Aldrich for ACS
spectroscopy using EtOH as a stabilizer (purity ≥ 99.8%), KANTO
for spectroscopy using amylene stabilizers (purity ≥ 99.0%),
Kishida for spectroscopy using EtOH as a stabilizer (purity ≥
99.0%), and TCI for HPLC using amylene stabilizers (purity ≥
99.5%).

K2CO3 are the same as those of without treating,
this is due to the insolubility of K2CO3 in
chloroform. Thus the protonation was confirmed by the addition of
1 vol % of pyridine, then number of other neutral and slightly acidic
solvents as well as acids. See the results in Figure 5.
