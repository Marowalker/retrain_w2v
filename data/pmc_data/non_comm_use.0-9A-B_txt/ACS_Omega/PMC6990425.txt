Bacterial populations use a cell-to-cell
communication system to
coordinate community-wide regulation processes, which is termed quorum
sensing (QS). Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a universal signal molecule that mediates inter-
and intraspecies QS systems among different bacteria. In this study,
the effects of exogenous addition of AI-2 synthesized in vitro on
physiological behaviors and proteome were investigated in lactic acid
bacteria strains. Exogenous AI-2 had a concentration-dependent effect
on the Enterococcus faecium 8-3 cell
density. There was no significant influence on biofilm formation and
individual morphology of cells upon 60 μM AI-2 addition in E. faecium 8-3 and Lactobacillus fermentum 2-1.
However, it improved the acid and alkali resistance of E. faecium 8-3. With the addition of AI-2, 15 differentially
expressed proteins were identified in E. faecium 8-3, which participate in RNA transport signaling, RNA polymerase,
ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, cysteine and methionine metabolism,
pyrimidine metabolism, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, purine
metabolism, biosynthesis of the amino acid pathway, etc. Among them,
the expression of 5-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine
nucleosidase, which is known to be involved in AI-2 synthesis and
cysteine and amino acid metabolism, was upregulated. These findings
will lay the foundation to clarify the mechanism of cell-to-cell communication
and bacterial physiological behaviors mediated by AI-2.

Introduction
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are commonly
used in the food industry,
including fermented dairy, meat, vegetable, and cereal foods. Diverse
species of LAB can be isolated from plant materials, fermented foods,
and the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract.1 Some of these bacteria have limited physiological abilities and
are constrained to a specific environment. Changes in environmental
factors can play a role in the survival and metabolism of LAB. Some
of the key factors for adapting the changes were attributed to complex
quorum sensing (QS) regulatory networks.2

Quorum sensing (QS) is a system used to communicate between
cells
that regulates various behaviors by a cell density-dependent manner.3 The QS system is switched on when the concentration
of QS signal molecules reaches the threshold and is perceived by cell
membrane proteins. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2), as one of the signal molecules,
is synthesized by the S-ribosylhomocysteine lyase
(LuxS) in both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and used for inter-
and intraspecies communication.4 The biosynthetic
pathway for AI-2 in different bacterial species is highly conserved;
AI-2 can be automatically converted from the precursor substance 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentandione
(DPD).5 The recognition of signals is likely
as important as signal synthesis, or even more. Homologous protein
complexes can perceive and transduce signals and their regulation
plays a key role in defining behaviors.6 Previous research studies have shown that AI-2 has the ability to
regulate a variety of physiological behaviors, including biofilm formation,7 virulence,8 and so
on. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1,
exogenous AI-2 influenced the biofilm amount and virulence factor
expression in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and increased the histological
lung damage in mice.9 In Streptococcus suis, AI-2 supplemented exogenously
had an impact on the expression of virulence genes and host–cell
adherence.10 Exogenous addition of synthesized
AI-2 in vitro showed a negative effect on the biofilm amount in Bacillus cereus and a positive effect on the cells
detached from a mature biofilm.11 Microarray
and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results
indicated an upregulation of the oxidative stress response under the
addition of AI-2 to planktonic Mycobacterium avium.12 The above research showed that exogenous AI-2
had an effect on different bacterial physiological behaviors, although
less investigation was focused on LAB.

Although the interspecies
signal molecule AI-2 is commonly in relation
to pathogenicity and virulence, it has recently been shown that the
LAB strains possess a functional luxS gene and have
the ability to produce AI-2. LAB strains can use the AI-2-mediated
QS system to regulate their physiological functions. In Bifidobacterium breve, AI-2 activities correlated
with gut colonization and pathogen protection.13 Furthermore, the overexpression of luxS gene in Bifidobacterium longum improved
biofilm formation, which is used for early colonization in the host
by probiotics.14 The Lactobacillus
sanfranciscensis metabolic processes were affected
by other sourdough Lactobacilli through the luxS-mediated
QS system.15 Two-dimensional electrophoresis
(2-DE) results showed that the LuxS protein expression level in Lactobacillus plantarum DC400 improved upon coculturing
with other strains.16 These results indicate
that AI-2 activity is produced by the interaction of the relevant
microbial food cultures during the fermentation process. However,
at present, our understanding of the effect of exogenous synthetic
AI-2 on LAB is clearly less. Thus, the mechanism of AI-2 regulating
the physiological behaviors and protein expression of LAB still needs
further study.

In this research, we aimed to explore the effects
of exogenous
AI-2 on LAB physiological functions, including cell morphology, biofilm
formation, and the tolerance to acid and alkaline conditions. The
strains of Enterococcus faecium 8-3
and Lactobacillus fermentum 2-1 with
high production of AI-2 were used for research.17 Furthermore, we employed a gel-free proteome approach to
detect the changes of proteome in both E. faecium 8-3 cells with exogenous synthetic AI-2 and without AI-2. The label-free
quantification (LFQ) method combined with liquid chromatography–quadrupole
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was used to achieve accurate quantification
and improve efficiency and accuracy. This is the first proteome research
to utilize the medium to gain new insights into AI-2-regulated LAB
metabolism.

Results
Effects of AI-2 on Cell Growth and Morphological
Characterization
The impact of in-vitro-synthesized AI-2
on E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 planktonic
bacterial growth was investigated, as demonstrated in Figure 1. The cell density of E. faecium 8-3 increased in the presence of 20, 40,
60, 80, and 100 μM AI-2 compared to that of the control. It
should be noted that with the increase of dosage the promotion effect
was more significant. Meanwhile, higher concentrations (80 and 100
μM AI-2) resulted in the promotion to occur at 1–10 h
and even for 25 h. Compared with that of E. faecium 8-3, synthesized AI-2 played a different role in the regulation
of L. fermentum 2-1 growth. The cell
density showed an increase during 1–7 h and a decrease during
10–25 h upon the addition of 40–100 μM AI-2. However,
these effects were not significant. The above results showed that E. faecium 8-3 planktonic bacterial growth responded
to the exogenous AI-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Nevertheless, there
was no obvious effect on L. fermentum 2-1 growth at the experimental concentration.

Figure 1 Effects of different
concentrations of AI-2 on the cell density
of (a) E. faecium 8-3 and (b) L. fermentum 2-1. *p < 0.05.

As shown in Figure 1, 60 μM AI-2 had a significant effect on bacterial
growth at
10 h and was chosen for further scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and biofilm formation experiments. Comparisons of the cells in the
absence and presence of 60 μM AI-2 were observed by SEM after
10 h incubation. SEM images (6000×) of E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 cells with
different treatments are shown in Figure 2. Two different shapes of bacteria in the
image correspond to the two strains of LAB, spherical in pairs of E. faecium 8-3 and rod shape of L.
fermentum 2-1. The morphology of bacterial cells was
not changed with in-vitro-synthesized AI-2 compared to that of the
control (Figure 2b,d).
The test cells were in a stage of division and proliferation, especially E. faecium 8-3, and their outline was clear and the
surface was smooth. The addition of AI-2 did not have an effect on E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 individual cells. The above results indicated that 60 μM
AI-2 had no effect
on the individual morphology of the test LAB strains.

Effects of AI-2 on Biofilm Formation
To further explore
the influence of AI-2 on E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1, we investigated
its effect on biofilm formation. As shown in Figure 3, 60 μM AI-2 did not affect biofilm
formation significantly at 10 and 24 h. The result indicated that
the presence of 60 μM AI-2 has no significant impact on biofilm
development in E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1.

the absorbance of dissolved bacteria-bound
crystal violet (CV). Both (a) and (b) show that AI-2 has no effect
on biofilm formation.

Effect of AI-2 on Acid
and Alkaline Resistance
To determine
whether AI-2 affects the LAB tolerance of acids and alkalies, E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 were grown in the Man–Rogosa–Sharpe (MRS) medium
supplemented with 60 μM AI-2 (AI-2+ cells). The cell
density of cultures was measured every 3 h until 25 h, and acid and
alkaline stress resistance were compared to that of the control (AI-2– cells). As shown in Figure 4, the cell density of E. faecium 8-3 was significantly affected by the addition of exogenous AI-2
(p < 0.05). Under acidic conditions (pH 4.5),
the growth of E. faecium 8-3 was inhibited
compared to that at pH 6.5 (Figure 1a), which was positively correlated with the decrease
of acidity. However, the growth of E. faecium 8-3 cells in acidic conditions was significantly improved upon the
addition of AI-2. At pH 4.5, the significant promotion effect was
mainly concentrated in the period of 13–25 h with AI-2 (Figure 4a). At pH 5.5, significant
promotion appeared at 4 h and lasted approximately 22 h. These results
indicated that the AI-2 promotion effect would appear with the reduction
of acid stress. Compared with the acid condition, the alkaline environment
was more favorable to the growth of E. faecium 8-3. Under acidic conditions, the maximum bacterial density of E. faecium 8-3 at a stable period is only 0.183 (Figure 4a). However, under
alkaline conditions, it could reach as high as 1.196 (Figure 4d). At pH 7.5, there was a
significant effect on E. faecium 8-3
cell density, which improved the growing ability under alkaline conditions.
The absorbances of AI-2+ cells harvested from all growth
phases were a little higher than those of AI-2– cells,
suggesting that AI-2 played a positive role at pH 7.5 (Figure 4c). At pH 8.5, the growth of E. faecium 8-3 might have reached its maximum capacity,
so the addition of 60 μM AI-2 had no significant effect on it
(Figure 4d).

Figure 4 Effects of
AI-2 on acid and alkaline resistance of E. faecium 8-3. (a) pH 4.5, (b) pH 5.5, (c) pH 7.5,
and (d) pH 8.5. *p < 0.05.

As shown in Figure 5, the strain of 2-1 is L. fermentum, which has stronger growth capacity under acidic stress than that
of E. faecium 8-3. The decrease of
the medium acidity enhanced the inhibition of L. fermentum 2-1 growth, including the maximum cell density and growth rate.
Meanwhile, the presence of AI-2 did not alleviate the inhibition of L. fermentum 2-1. AI-2+ and AI-2– cells showed similar OD595 nm, which indicated that
the influence of exogenous AI-2 on the growth and tolerance of L. fermentum 2-1 in acidic conditions was not obvious
(Figure 5a,b). The
growth of L. fermentum 2-1 in the MRS
medium in the presence and absence of 60 μM AI-2 at pH 7.5 and
pH 8.5 for 25 h was assessed. The growth of L. fermentum 2-1 was basically not affected under the condition of mild alkalinity,
but the rate slowed down due to the exponential phase lag with the
increase of pH value. There was higher cell density in cultures in
the presence of AI-2 following mild alkali treatment (pH 7.5) compared
to that of the control (AI-2– cells), especially
between 16 and 25 h. Interestingly, at pH 8.5, the effect of AI-2
on the growth of L. fermentum 2-1 showed
an opposite effect (Figure 5d) compared to that on cultures before treatment (Figure 5c). The addition
of AI-2 inhibited the growth of L. fermentum 2-1, especially between 19 and 25 h. The above results indicated
that exogenous AI-2 had various effects in different strains and improved
the acid and alkali resistance of a specific strain.

and alkaline resistance of L. fermentum 2-1. (a) pH 4.5, (b) pH 5.5, (c) pH

Proteome Profile of E. faecium 8-3
after Coculturing with AI-2
After culturing of E. faecium 8-3 with the addition of AI-2 for 10 h,
the cells were collected and used for proteome analysis. The intracellular
proteins in tests and controls were extracted to identify proteins
that possibly participate in physiological metabolic processes. A
total of 851 and 960 proteins were detected in the test and control,
respectively. Fifteen proteins displayed significantly different abundance
(>1.5-fold difference, p < 0.05) in the expressed
protein numbers of E. faecium 8-3 after
the coculture was affected by AI-2 (Table 1). In addition, 14 and 24 proteins were uniquely
identified in control and supplement AI-2 conditions, respectively.

The proteins were classified into
different categories according
to Gene Ontology (GO) (Figure 6a). Statistical analysis results showed that the expression
of six proteins decreased from 0.420- to 0.658-fold and the expression
of nine proteins increased from 1.526- to 2.745-fold (Table 1). Differently expressed proteins
were arranged into the following categories: S-adenosylmethionine
cycle, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) metabolic process,
amino acid salvage, ribonucleoprotein complex subunit organization,
ribosomal large subunit biogenesis, ribonucleoprotein complex assembly, l-methionine salvage, l-methionine salvage from S-adenosylmethionine, ribosome assembly, ribosomal large
subunit assembly, RNA repair, l-methionine salvage from methylthioadenosine
(MTA), l-cysteine metabolic process, and tRNA 3′-terminal
CCA addition.

(molecular functions (MFs), biological processes (BPs), and cellular

of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways (top 10).

Based on the above results, many functions were influenced by AI-2
addition. In this study, the enrichment analysis of the upregulated
and downregulated differentially expressed proteins was performed
respectively using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways (Figure 6b)
and it was found that the upregulated differentially expressed proteins
were mainly concentrated in the RNA transport signaling pathway. At
the same time, possible signaling pathways included RNA polymerase,
ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, cysteine and methionine metabolism,
pyrimidine metabolism, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, purine
metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, etc. It suggested that exogenous
AI-2 plays a role in multiple pathways, which are essential for bacterial
establishment and cell metabolism.

Among them, the AI-2 anabolic
related protein MtnN was involved
in the cysteine and methionine metabolic pathways. It suggested that
upregulated MtnN was involved in multiple amino acid metabolic pathways.
We further selected 15 proteins for mRNA level validation based on
bioinformatics analysis and participation in AI-2-induced metabolic
pathways. The RT-PCR results of gene expression were consistent with
the results of proteins (Table 1).

Discussion
AI-2 is widely found
in bacteria and commonly considered as a universal
QS signal molecule for cell communication. In a solution environment,
AI-2 with various forms is converted and balanced;18 therefore, it can be recognized by bacteria of different
species. In this study, we attempted to explore whether exogenous
AI-2 would interfere with the growth of bacteria and our experiments
indicated that exogenous AI-2 had an apparent effect. The influence
of exogenous AI-2 on the morphological characterization of LAB was
similar: there was no effect on the individual morphology of the test
LAB when the concentration of DPD was 60 μM, but it affected
the mutual cross-linking and adhesion between the cells. It was also
found that exogenous DPD had concentration-dependent effects on different
strains. A low concentration of DPD was found to gently promote cell
growth. Higher concentrations of DPD improved cell density, but they
were not always positively correlated. Interestingly, the growth rates
of E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 both at the logarithmic phase increased.
Therefore, during the growth of E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1, exogenous
AI-2 can be used as a substance to promote the growth of bacteria.

The biofilm of bacteria is a typically complex multispecies community
that develops through the adhesion of different species cells onto
a surface and is promoted by cell-to-cell interactions in the bacterial
community. It has been verified that AI-2 played a role in biofilm
formation in many species, but the AI-2 function has been not fully
revealed. Our results showed that 60 μM concentration of DPD
did not influence biofilm formation significantly on E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1. According to the different AI-2 concentrations and bacterial
species, the influence of AI-2 on biofilm formation was also different.
It has been reported that AI-2 affects biofilm formation in a dose-dependent
way in B. cereus.11 The B. cereus biofilm amount
decreased upon the addition of exogenous AI-2 in the concentration
range from 0 to 6.8 μM. The same effect of AI-2 on biofilm was
also confirmed in Eikenella corrodens and Vibrio cholerae.19,20 However, different effects were found in Staphylococcus
intermedius and Streptococcus pneumonia.21,22 Wang et al. reported that when AI-2 levels
reached a threshold, a lot of biological properties altered in bacterial
cells, especially those associated with biofilm formation.10 The concentration of AI-2 higher than 2 μM
showed an opposite function on S. suis biofilm formation, which differs from other bacterial species.10 Bacteria live in the environment predominantly
in the form of biofilms, which has been shown to be a response to
environmental stresses, as well as in mammalian hosts. Thus, the functions
of AI-2 in bacterial community formation and dynamic change were conceivable.
AI-2 can influence the ability to withstand adverse circumstances
of bacteria by influencing the formation of biofilms.

Our previous
study showed that environmental factors did cause
changes in the activity of AI-223 and a
number of bacteria use quorum sensing signal molecules to resist stressful
factors, including starvation, NaCl, hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotics.24−26 In this study, the cell density of E. faecium 8-3 under acidic and alkaline stresses increased when AI-2 was added
to the culture medium. For L. fermentum 2-1, the addition of AI-2 had a relatively small effect on the cell
density. There was only an inhibition effect on cell density under
severe alkaline stress. One possible explanation for this difference
is that AI-2 synthesized in vitro has diverse activities at different
pH values. Another possible explanation is that different bacterial
species have different AI-2 sensing threshold levels. The uptake of
AI-2 was modified by lsrACDBFGE operon, which contained
a transporter complex, LsrABCD; a cognate signal kinase, LsrK; and
an AI-2 repressor, LsrR.27 The operons
in different strains may have dissimilar responses to exogenous AI-2.
Current knowledge relative to the cell’s ability to perceive
or recognize the AI-2 in the LAB was scarce.

As Moslehi-Jenabian
et al. reported, AI-2 activity seemed positively
correlated with acid shock intensity.28 Delisa et al. have proved that AI-2 activity could be increased
for several hours because of the osmolarity pulse in Escherichia coli.29 However,
the AI-2-mediated QS system did not associate with acid and heat tolerance
in Salmonella.30 Hence,
the role of AI-2 in bacterial cells on the response and resistance
to environmental stresses seemed to be strain-specific.

Deciphering
the molecular basis of AI-2 and bacterial cell communication
is the key to understand the metabolic mechanism of LAB and how bacteria
interact with each other. Here, we used E. faecium 8-3 as a model to investigate the effect of AI-2 on LAB protein
expression because the 8-3 strain was more sensitive to exogenous
AI-2, according to the above results. To determine the effect of AI-2
on E. faecium 8-3 protein expression,
we incubated E. faecium 8-3 and exogenous
AI-2 for 10 h prior to cell harvest. In this study, proteome signatures
associated with signal molecule AI-2 were identified. Differential
regulatory proteins provide new insights into bacterial cell communication.
Clearly, AI-2 altered the protein profiles in E. faecium 8-3, indicating that both molecular and biological functions were
affected by the action of quorum sensing signal molecules.

With
the addition of AI-2, the topmost changed protein in E. faecium 8-3 was S-adenosylhomocysteine/methylthioadenosine
nucleosidase (SAHN). It indicated that exogenous AI-2 might induce
the expression of this protein in E. faecium 8-3. S-adenosylhomocysteine/methylthioadenosine
nucleosidase is essential for the methyl cycle in many bacteria and
protozoan species but is not found in mammalian cells. SAHN is indispensable
in the bacterial activated methyl cycle (AMC) process. It is involved
in the cleavage of methylthioadenosine (MTA) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) glycosidic bonds, producing adenine and
methylthioribose (MTR) and S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH), respectively.
They are further transformed into homocysteine, DPD, and methylthioribose-1-phosphate
(MTRP) by the action of MTA kinase and autoinducer synthetase LuxS.
The function of SAHN associated with the production of two QS signaling
molecules, AI-1 and AI-2.31 In E. coli, the loss of sahn gene caused
the accumulation of toxic SAH, resulting in reduced growth.31E. colipfs mutants were known to have strongly impaired growth
and their colonies were much smaller than those of the parent strains.32 Silva et al. reported that there was no significant
effect on biofilm formation in pfs mutants of V. cholerae but had an inhibition effect on the growth
and motility.33 These results are consistent
with the results of this study. In our study, the expression of SAHN
was induced by exogenous AI-2 and resulted in an enhanced effect on
the growth and no effect on biofilm formation. Meanwhile, overexpressed
SAHN promoted the QS system of bacteria.31 The protein of SAHN was associated with cysteine and methionine
metabolism pathways. In the process of catabolism, methionine can
produce a carbon group through the action of methylation and a carbon
group can be used as the methyl source of pyrimidine, purine, and
various methylated compounds.34,35 The addition of exogenous
AI-2 also has an impact on the methyl cycle, thereby promoting the
growth of E. faecium 8-3.

ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter is a ubiquitous superfamily
that is responsible for the transmembrane transport of a variety of
substances.36 Upon the addition of exogenous
AI-2, the expression of EcfA protein in E. faecium 8-3 was downregulated, which participated in the ABC transport pathway.
ECF transporters were used for importing micronutrients in archaea
and bacteria. The zymolyte contains a series of cofactors, transition-metal
ions, water-soluble vitamins, the amino acid tryptophan, and queuosine
and its metabolic precursors.37 ECF import
systems were used for vitamin uptake by some bacteria, with restricted
cofactor biosynthetic capacities, including Mycoplasma
genitalium, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. pneumoniae.38 The addition of exogenous AI-2 could affect the transport
process of different substrates through downregulation of EcfA expression
in the EFC transporter family.

In this study, exogenous AI-2
played a role in the growth of bacterial
cells and physiological behaviors of E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1. At the
same time, the global proteins that might be involved in interaction
between LAB and exogenous signal molecule AI-2 were first identified
and quantified in our research. Exogenous AI-2 promoted the growth
of E. faecium 8-3 but had no effect
on individual morphology and biofilm formation in E.
faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1. The cell density increased under acid and alkaline stresses.
The differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the
cysteine and methionine amino acid synthesis pathways and RNA transport
pathways. However, whether different factors such as concentrations
of AI-2, incubation time, and strain species also have an effect on
the expression of different proteins remains to be further studied.

Materials
and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 isolated from Chinese koumiss were identified previously by
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.17 Strains
were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h in Man–Rogosa–Sharpe
(MRS) broth.39 pEASY-Blunt E1 was used
as the prokaryotic protein expression vector. E. coli strains DH5a and E. coli Transetta
(DE3) (TransGen Biotech) were grown at 37 °C in LB broth with
aeration and used for the cloning and expression of recombinant genes,
respectively. Vibrio harveyi BB170
(ATCC BAA-1117) was used for the measurement of AI-2 activity and
cultured in autoinducer bioassay (AB) medium or marine broth 2216
(Difco) at 30 °C with aeration.40

AI-2 Synthesis in Vitro
In vitro AI-2 synthesis reactions
were performed according to the previous method.41 Briefly, expression vectors harboring the luxS and pfs genes were constructed by the genes of E. faecium 8-3 and prokaryotic protein expression
vector pEASY-Blunt E1. Cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration
for scale-up production of recombinant LuxS and Pfs proteins and induced
with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
Recombinant proteins were isolated and purified by the Ni-IDA-Sefinose
resin kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sangon
Biotech). AI-2 was produced by incubation with 1 mg/mL purified recombinant
LuxS and Pfs proteins and 1 mM S-adenosylhomocysteine
(SAH, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C in 10 mM sodium phosphate
buffer at pH 8.0. Ellman’s assay was employed to quantify homocysteine
concentration and estimate AI-2 concentration by measuring the absorbance
at 412 nm.4 AI-2 activity was detected
by Vibrio harveyi BB170.42

Effect of AI-2 on Growth and Morphological
Characterization
To determine the effects of AI-2 on the
growth of E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1, a growth-curve assay was conducted. E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 were cultured
in MRS broth in the absence or presence of AI-2 (20, 40, 60, 80, and
100 μM) (synthesized in vitro). Strains were incubated at 37
°C for 25 h. After 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 25 h, the optical
density was determined at 595 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo
Scientific Multiskan FC). Morphological changes of E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 upon treatment with AI-2 for 10 h at 37 °C were examined
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as previously described.43 Untreated cells of E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 were used
as a control.

Effect of AI-2 on Biofilm Formation
Biofilm formation
was measured at a static environment in 96-well polystyrene microtiter
plates.44 In brief, overnight cultures
of E. faecium 8-3 and L. fermentum 2-1 were diluted to an optical density
of 0.1 at 595 nm. AI-2 was added to the medium with a final concentration
of 60 μM, and the mixtures (200 μL) were transferred to
96-well microtiter plates (Corning) that were incubated at 37 °C
for 10 and 25 h. Untreated cells were used as a control. Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) was used for washing plates at least 3 times. Then, 0.1%
crystal violet (CV) was added to the dried plates at room temperature
for 5 min. After washing, the plates were also air-dried. Then, 95%
ethanol (200 μL) was added to the dried plates to dissolve bacteria-bound
CV. The OD595 nm of dissolved bacteria-bound CV was
determined to represent the biofilm amount.

Effect of AI-2 on Acid
and Alkaline Resistance
The
overnight cultures of E. faecium 8-3
and L. fermentum 2-1 were inoculated
to sterile MRS broth with different pH values (4.5, 5.5, 7.5, and
8.5). HCl (2 M) and 5 M NaOH were used to adjust the pH of sterile
MRS broth. AI-2 with a concentration of 60 μM was added, and
the mixtures were cultured at 37 °C for 25 h. Untreated cells
were used as a control. After 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25 h,
the optical density was determined at 595 nm using a microplate reader.

Proteome Analysis
E. faecium 8-3 treated with and without AI-2 (60 μM) for 10 h was used
for gel-free proteome analysis. The strain was prepared as biological
triplicates and lysed in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris–HCl,
4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM dl-dithiothreitol (DTT),
pH 7.6. Cell disruption was accomplished with agitation by a homogenizer
(Fastprep-24, MP Biomedical). The supernatants were collected by centrifugation
at 14 000 rpm for 40 min and filter-sterilized by a 0.22 μm
filter. The protein concentration was measured by the BCA protein
assay (Bio-Rad). The protein solutions were stored at −80 °C
for further analysis.

The digestion of proteins was performed
in accordance with the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) procedure.45 In brief, proteins (200 μg) of each sample
were added into 30 μL of SDT buffer (150 mM Tris–HCl,
100 mM DTT, 4% SDS, pH 8.0). DTT and other low-molecular-weight components
were removed by UA buffer (150 mM Tris–HCl, 8 M urea, pH 8.0)
and repeated ultrafiltration (Microcon units, 30 kD) through centrifugation.
Then, the UA buffer was used to block cysteine residues with the addition
of 0.05 M iodoacetamide and incubated for 20 min in the dark. The
UA buffer and 25 mM NH4HCO3 were used to wash
the filter 3 times and twice, respectively. Finally, the protein suspension
was incubated overnight along with trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C
in 25 mM NH4HCO3. The content of peptide was
estimated at 280 nm by UV spectral density.

Liquid chromatography
(Thermo Scientific) was used for LC–MS/MS
and coupled with a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific)
as previously reported.46 Briefly, peptides
were transferred into a reverse-phase trap column (Thermo Scientific
Acclaim PepMap100, nanoViper C18, 100 μm × 2 cm) combined
with a C18 reverse-phase column (10 cm long, 3 μm resin, 75
μm inner diameter, Thermo Scientific Easy Column) in buffer
A and a linear gradient buffer B (0.1% formic acid and 84% acetonitrile)
was used to separate at 300 nL/min over 120 min. A Q-Exactive mass
spectrometer was combined with Easy nLC (Proxeon Biosystems, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) for MS experiments. Positive ion mode was used
in the mass spectrometer. The 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans (AGC target
5e5) with a normalized collision energy of 30 eV were performed
after a full FT scan mass spectrum cycle (the automatic gain control
(AGC) target was 1e6, and the HCD fragmentation was 300–1800 m/z). 0.1% was used to specify the minimum
percentage of target values that can be reached at the maximum fill
time. The HCD spectral resolution was 17 500 at m/z 200, the isolation width was 2 m/z, and survey scans were obtained at a resolution
of 70 000 at m/z 200. The
dynamic exclusion duration was 60 s. The peptide recognition mode
was used to operate the instrument.

Sequence Database Search
and Data Analysis
The abundance
of proteome and raw mass data analysis were performed by MaxQuant
software (version 1.3.0.5) and searched against the UniProt E. faecium database (104 108 total entries,
downloaded on August 24, 2017).47 The relative
protein abundance and spectral intensities were normalized through
the LFQ algorithm.48 Proteins that matched
to contaminants or reverse database were removed. Proteins that were
found in at least two replicates from one sample were further analyzed.49 A t-test was used to quantitatively
analyze protein abundance in different pairs of the sample. The fold
changes of protein abundance >1.5 or <0.67 (p value
>0.05) were included in the quantitative results. The GO visualization
tool50 and the Database for Annotation,
Visualization and Integrated Discovery51 were used to analyze the identified proteins by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment,
including biological processes (BPs), cellular components (CCs), and
molecular function (MFs). The KEGG was used to annotate the functional
genes by GHOST or BLAST comparisons parallel to the manually curated
KEGG GENES database for pathway analysis.52.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
E. faecium 8-3 was cultured in MRS with AI-2 (60
μM) or without (control) at 37 °C for 10 h. Total RNA was
extracted with RNAiso Plus (Takara, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Gel electrophoresis and absorbance (A260/A280 and A260/A230)
were used to detect RNA quality. Isolated RNA was transcribed into
cDNA by a PrimeScrip RT reagent kit (Takara, Japan). qRT-PCR was performed
by the SYBR Green assay kit (Takara, Japan) and a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time
PCR system (Bio-Rad). The 16S rRNA gene was used as a housekeeping
gene. The 2–ΔΔCt method
is used to calculate the relative expression of certain genes.53

Statistical Analysis
Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was
carried out, and P values <0.05 indicated statistical
significance.
