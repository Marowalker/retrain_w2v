Several
nanomaterials rely on the passive accumulation in the neoplasm
target because of enhanced permeability and retention effect. On the
other hand, directing nanomaterials to the target by employing the
targeting agents may lead to a pivotal improvement in the efficacy
of the treatment for a number of cancers. However, targeting moieties
often lose their functionality upon injection in the bloodstream,
leaving questions on their efficiency. Here, we assessed using a significant
in vitro 3D model of pancreatic carcinoma the targeting efficiency
of passion fruit-like nanoarchitectures (NAs) incorporated with a
peptide that can recognize transferrin directly in the medium, thereby
modulating protein solvation. NAs are biodegradable ultrasmall-in-nano
platforms that combine the most appealing behaviors of noble metal
nanomaterials with organism excretion of the building blocks by the
renal pathway. Although the confocal images did not illustrate the
significant differences in the targeting efficiency of the peptide-modified
NAs, an improved internalization was quantitatively observed by inductively
coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis. Our findings demonstrate
that the peptide conjugation of NAs might be considered to enhance
their theranostic potentials for this type of neoplasm.

Introduction
Accurate delivery of
therapeutics to the site of interest is pivotal
for the treatment of a number of diseases, among which are neoplasms,
in order to enhance the efficacy while decreasing the adverse side
effects.1,2 On the one hand, nanomaterials have commonly
demonstrated an intrinsic ability to passively accumulate in a number
of neoplasms because of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
effect.1,2 On the other hand, an increasing number
of investigations have shed light on the fact that the EPR is a complex
phenomenon that may not accurately represent the biological dynamics
in humans.2,3 Thus, despite some drawbacks such as complex
postprocessing procedures, additional production cost, and uncertain
efficiency, a number of targeting agents have been developed and conjugated
to nanomaterials.4,5 An elegant approach to enhance
the targeting efficacy of nanomaterials is through modulation of their
protein corona composition, which leads to an endogenously triggered
selectivity.6 Meanwhile, besides localized
accumulation of nanomaterials to the target, other concerns have hampered
the translation to clinical practice of almost all the candidates
developed in the last 30 years.7,8 This is especially true
for noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), which still remain confined to
the bench-side because of the concerns on undefined persistence, despite
a number of appealing features for theranostics.9−12 The combination of the behaviors
of NPs with the metal excretion from the renal pathway was recently
demonstrated by the platforms developed within the ultrasmall-in-nano
approach.12 Passion fruit-like nanoarchitectures
(NAs) are promising examples of nature-inspired ultrasmall-in-nano
platform that may bring again NPs to the forefront of cancer theranostics
by overcoming the key question of regulatory agencies regarding the
metal persistence after the designed action.13,14 NAs are biodegradable silica nanocapsules comprising gold ultrasmall
NPs (USNPs) embedded in a polymeric functional matrix.13 In cellular environment, NAs disassemble to
biocompatible and renal clearable building blocks in 48 h: silicic
acid, polymers, and endogenous glutathione (GSH) coated gold USNP.14−16 Furthermore, the impressive versatility and robustness of the production
protocol was already demonstrated together with some of their potential
applications as drug delivery vehicles and dual photoacoustic/ultrasound
imaging contrast agents, pointing out that all the components of NAs
are intrinsically essential.14,17,18

Here, we utilized the straightforwardly modifiable surface
of NAs
to perform a click chemistry conjugation of the NPs to a customized
peptide. The employed peptide (Tf2, sequence: CGGGHKYLRW) binds with
transferrin (Kd = 0.90 ± 0.25 μM)
and was designed to target cells overexpressing the transferrin receptor.6 Moreover, Tf2 is capable of endogenously triggering
an enhanced accumulation of NAs in neoplasms by the protein corona
modulation. The cell targeting and internalization performance of
peptide-functionalized NAs were quantitatively assessed on significant
in vitro three-dimensional (3D) models of pancreatic carcinoma. We
have developed 3D spheroids because of their closer resemblance to
in vivo models compared to conventional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer
cell cultures. The advantages of using 3D spheroids include the establishment
of tumor microenvironment, physiochemical gradients, and cell–cell/cell–matrix
interactions.19 In addition, in vitro 3D
models are in agreement with the development and promotion of alternatives
to animal experiments according to the “3Rs concept”.20

Results and Discussion
The 3D cultures
of MIA PaCa-2 were prepared by a modified hanging
method and maintained in an incubator with an orbital shaker.21 It was worth noticing that the orbital shaking
was crucial for the maintenance of the 3D cultures to avoid monolayer
proliferation. The 3D cell cultures can be maintained for up to 1
month, and the diameter of the spheroids range from 650 μm to
about 1 mm. In order to improve the consistency of our investigation,
the 3D spheroids were maintained for 12–14 days, reaching an
average diameter of 950 μm. In Figure 1A, the bright-field microscopy image of a
typical 3D MIA PaCa-2 spheroid is reported, demonstrating the concentric
arrangement of viable and necrotic cells. Moreover, the 3D spheroids
were observed to be a composite of spherical cells with an average
size of 17.1 ± 2.9 μm (Figure 1B,C). The orthogonal view (Figure S1A) illustrated the spherical construction of the
cells more evidently. For comparison, we also cultured MIA PaCa-2
cells in a standard 2D monolayer fashion (Figure 1D,E), demonstrating an epithelial-like growth.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ultrastructure analysis
confirmed that the morphology of the MIA PaCa-2 cells was similar
in both 2D and 3D cultures (Figure S2A,B). Interestingly, cells composing the 3D models were interconnected
mostly by an early tight junction (Figure S2C,D). Signs of mild hypoxia were also observed (Figure S2C).

Passion fruit-like NAs were produced
by employing the standard
protocol.13 The general synthesis scheme
to obtain about 100 nm NAs (Figure S3A)
is illustrated in Figure 2A. To track NAs during the cellular investigations, commercial
AlexaFluor-647 was covalently linked to the polymer [poly-(l-lysine); 15–30 kDa] prior to its use to synthesize the dye-loaded
NAs (NAs-647).15 As expected, the absorbance
spectrum of NAs-647 (Figure 2B) showed the presence of bands because of the dye and the
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold USNPs. Only the
absorbance due to LSPR was observed on the spectrum of the standard
NAs. Furthermore, previous surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy investigations
have demonstrated that the dyes were comprised in the cavity and not
on the surface of NAs.13 The surface modification
of NAs-647 was performed employing a 2 kDa silane–poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG)–maleimide linker in order to (i) incorporate
a thiol-reactive group on the surface of NAs through a single postprocessing
step and (ii) utilize the benefits of PEGylation on nanoparticle-based
theranostics.22 Then, the click chemistry
conjugation of Tf2 peptide to NAs was performed through a maleimide–thiol
reaction. The potential free-maleimide groups left on the surface
of NAs were blocked by employing GSH. The changes in the zeta potential
values after each step confirmed the success of the procedure (Figure S3B). Indeed, the zeta potential for NAs-647
was −21.3 ± 0.6 mV and increased to −7.23 ±
0.41 mV for NAs-647–Tf2 because of the presence of the peptide.
GSH blocking slightly decreased the zeta potential to −8.09
± 0.53 mV, confirming the presence of some free-maleimide groups
after the reaction with Tf2, to which GSH subsequently reacted with.
All cellular experiments were performed using GSH-treated NAs-647–Tf2.
Remarkably, the TEM images (Figure 2C) highlighted that the postprocessing steps did not
affect the physical structure of the NAs. NAs, NAs-647, and NAs-647–Tf2
maintained the “passion fruit-like arrangement,” and
no significant structural modifications were recognized. To further
ensure the success of the functionalization procedure, the maleimide–thiol
reaction was also performed using a thiol-modified Atto-425 instead
of Tf2 (NAs-647–SH-Atto425). The same dye containing a carboxylic
acid functional group was employed to serve as the control sample
(NAs-647/Atto425-COOH). The confocal images after incubation of 3D
MIA PaCa-2 models with both samples (Figure S4) confirmed through Pearson’s coefficient the higher colocalization
of NAs-647 and Atto-425 in NAs-647–SH-Atto425 compared to the
control NAs-647/Atto425-COOH.

Gold USNPs were
embedded in AlexaFluor-647-modified poly(l-lysine). The polymeric
aggregates were employed as templates to form hollow silica nanocapsules
(NAs) by a modified Stöber method. The surface of NAs was modified
by silane–PEG–maleimide linkers. Finally, NAs were click-chemical
functionalized by the peptide Tf2, and GSH was added to block the
excess maleimide ends. (B) Background-subtracted UV–vis spectrum

NAs-647 (middle), and GSH-treated NAs-647–Tf2 (right). The
Gray matrix is due to a not-completely-dry sample during the imaging.
Scale bar: 50 nm.

NAs-647 and NAs-647–Tf2
were incubated for 2 h with 3D MIA
PaCa-2 models, and confocal images were collected from 0 to 72 h postincubation
(Figure 3A). At t = 0 h, both NAs attached on the cell membranes resulting
in individual dots of similar size (inset of Figure 3A). After 24 h, the signals from both types
of NAs appeared more aggregated and more colocalized inside the cells,
highlighting an internalization process. Overall, no qualitative differences
on the targeting efficiency were distinguished between NAs-647 and
NAs-647–Tf2. Interestingly, the intensity of the signals from
the dye increased for both samples at 48 and 72 h time points. This
can be related to the changes in the structures of NAs-647 and NAs-647–Tf2,
implying their biodegradation. Indeed, at time 0 and 24 h, the NAs
were intact, and the dye was quenched because of the proximity to
the gold USNPs, leading to reduced emission intensity.14 On the other hand, at later time points, NAs
disassembled, allowing the dye to increase the distance from gold
USNPs surfaces. This observation was further supported by the decreasing
amount of gold quantified through inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS). It is worth noticing that the imaging quality
in confocal microscopy is dependent on the sample depth. Cells and
NAs located in the inner part of the 3D cell constructs were not clearly
imaged. Therefore, analytical instruments, such as ICP-MS, provide
complementary data that take into consideration the total gold content
of the whole 3D cell construct, for a quantitative analysis of the
samples. Furthermore, the collected data can be normalized for both
the gold loaded in the nanomaterials and the protein content of the
3D cell constructs, in order to obtain a more accurate comparison
of the targeting and internalization efficiencies of nanomaterials.
Indeed, the collected amount of gold from both NAs-647 and NAs-647–Tf2
was double-normalized to the total protein content and to the starting
amount of gold on each NAs where the 3D spheroids were incubated (Figure 3B). NAs-647–Tf2
resulted to an average of 1.5× higher internalization with respect
to NAs-647. Overall, the surface functionalization and peptide conjugation
of NAs may not have generated a substantial improvement in the targeting
efficiency of NAs but led to an increased particle cell internalization.
On the other hand, the significant internalization of nontargeted
NAs-647 may be due to the ability of the MIA PaCa-2 cells to uptake
materials from the environment even if organized in 3D models. Apart
from enhanced internalization, NAs-647–Tf2 also demonstrated
intracellular retention. This effect can be related to the transferrin
receptor-mediated endocytosis, which may also have a different intracellular
fate compared to the nonspecific endocytosis of unfunctionalized particles.23

total protein content.

Conclusions
In summary, we have evaluated the targeting
and internalization
efficiency of the peptide-functionalized passion fruit-like NA on
3D pancreatic carcinoma models. The confocal microscopy images confirmed
the cell localization and internalization of both targeted and nontargeted
NAs after 2 h of incubation. Furthermore, we have quantified an increased
cell internalization of the peptide-conjugated NA. Thus, this approach
can be considered to improve nanoparticle internalization for this
kind of neoplasm, regardless of the concerns with targeting moiety
conjugation in terms of additional procedures and cost.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Alexa-647 was purchased from Invitrogen,
and silane–PEG–maleimide (2 kDa) was from Nanocs. All
other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise
specified. All chemicals were used as received.

Synthesis of
Passion Fruit-Like NAs
Synthesis of Dye-Modified Poly(l-lysine)
Poly(l-lysine) hydrobromide (15–30
kDa) was dissolved in Milli-Q
water to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL. From this stock solution,
150 μL was added with AlexaFluor-647-NHS ester (200 μg)
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (200 μL). The solution was
stirred overnight at room temperature and used without further purification.

Synthesis of Gold USNPs
Gold USNPs with a diameter
of approximately 3 nm were prepared by mixing Milli-Q water (20 mL),
poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (70 kDa, 30% aqueous solution), and
HAuCl4 solution (10 mg/mL in Milli-Q). The solution was
stirred vigorously while adding 200 μL of 8 mg/mL NaBH4. The solution was allowed to further mix for 2 min and aged for
another 10 min.

Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticle Arrays
Poly(l-lysine) (200 μL), plain or dye-modified, was
added to the
solution containing the gold USNPs. The solution was stirred for 20
min. The gold aggregates were collected through centrifugation at
13 400 rpm for 3 min. The product was resuspended in Milli-Q
water (2 mL) and sonicated for a maximum of 4 min.

Synthesis
of NAs or NAs-647
The synthesized gold nanoparticle
arrays (2 mL in Milli-Q) were added to a solution containing absolute
ethanol (70 mL), ammonium hydroxide solution (2.4 mL, 30% in water),
and tetraethyl orthosilicate (40 μL, 98%). The solution was
allowed to gently shake for 3 h. The products, NAs or NAs-647, were
collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min. Particles were
washed twice with ethanol to remove unreacted precursors. A short-spin
centrifugation was done to separate particles with the diameter greater
than 200 nm. The supernatant was then collected and centrifuged again
at 13 400 rpm for 2.5 min. The final product was stored in
1 mL of ethanol.

Surface Modification and Functionalization
of NAs-647
NAs-647 was added to ethanol (5 mL) with a silane–PEG–maleimide
linker (1 mL, 400 μg/mL). The volume was adjusted to 10 mL using
ethanol, and the solution was stirred vigorously for 15 min. The particles
were recovered by centrifugation at 13 400 rpm for 5 min and
washed with ethanol twice. Then, the particles were resuspended in N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer (1.25 mL, 20 mM, pH 7.2) and sonicated. The Tf2
peptide was prepared as reported elsewhere.6 The peptide (250 μL, 400 μg/mL in HEPES buffer) was
added, and the solution was stirred for 2 h. l-GSH (500 μL,
200 μg/mL in HEPES buffer) was then added to the solution to
react with the excess of maleimide groups. The reaction was stirred
for another hour. NAs-647–Tf2 was recovered by centrifugation
at 13 400 rpm for 3 min. Particles were washed twice in ethanol.
The final product was stored in ethanol to maintain sterility and
sonicated for 5 min.

UV–Vis Spectrophotometry
The absorption spectra
were obtained using a double-beam Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. The
samples in PBS (1×) were placed in quartz cuvettes with a 1.5
mm path length.

Electron Microscopy
The TEM observations
of particles
and cells were performed in ZEISS Libra 120 and operated at an accelerating
voltage of 120 kV. The colloidal solutions of the NPs (5 μL)
were deposited to a 300-mesh of carbon-coated copper grids.

Ultrastructure
Analysis of 3D MIA PaCa-2
The MIA PaCa-2
3D spheroids in the suspension have been fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde
in sodium cacodylate buffer (0.1 M pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature
and then treated for resin embedding as previously reported.24 Briefly, the recovered spheroids were kept in
a new fixative solution (overnight at 4 °C), then the cells were
postfixed 1 h (2% OsO4 in sodium cacodylate buffer; 0.1
M pH 7.4), and stained with 3% solution of uranyl acetate in 20% ethanol.
Finally, they were dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin (Epon 812,
Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA, USA). Polymerization has
been performed for 48 h at 60 °C. In order to perform ultrastructural
analysis, 90 nm sections of the treated samples were cut by using
UC7 (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria).

Zeta Potential
Measurement
The zeta potential measurements
were performed on Malvern Zetasizer nano ZS90 using a DTS 1060 standard
capillary cell. During measurements, the NPs were resuspended in PBS
(2 mL) at pH 7.4 and sonicated for 5 min. The reported values are
the average of five consecutive measurements.

3D Cell Culture
Human pancreatic carcinoma cells (MIA
PaCa-2) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
The cells cultured in 2D were maintained in a Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mmol/L l-glutamine, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). 3D cell constructs
were prepared as reported elsewhere, with slight modifications.21 Briefly, cells cultured in 2D were washed
with PBS and detached from the culture plate using trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (Invitrogen). Cells were settled by centrifugation at 200g for 5 min. Fresh culture medium was added. The cells were
counted, and the concentration was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/mL. After homogenizing, 10 μL of cell suspension drops
were placed on the lid of a 35 mm cell culture dish. The lid was flipped
into the chamber containing 2 mL of PBS. The cells were allowed to
settle at the bottom of the drops and were transferred to a 35 mm
suspension/nontreated culture dish after 24 h. The cells were finally
placed inside a CO2 incubator with an orbital shaker (90
rpm).

Cell Incubation in NAs
In a 500 μL plastic vial,
a 200 μL aliquot of NAs-647 or NAs-647–Tf2 stored in
ethanol was added. The particles were collected by centrifugation,
resuspended in a complete medium (200 μL), and sonicated for
5 min. NAs were then added to a 2 mL plastic vial containing 800 μL
of the complete medium and the 3D models, which were transferred using
1 mL pipet tips. The vials were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and
5% CO2. After that, the cells were washed with PBS twice.
All the 3D models were transferred to a 35 mm nontreated culture dish
with 3 mL of the complete medium. The cells evaluated on different
time points were taken from the same culture dish.

Confocal Microscopy
In a 2 mL plastic vial, four to
six cell constructs were collected using 1 mL pipet tips. The cells
were settled and washed in PBS, whereas in 100 μL of PBS, Hoechst
33342 (Invitrogen; 80 μg/mL) and CellMask green plasma membrane
stain (Invitrogen; 10 μg/mL) were added, and the cells were
incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 15 min. Afterward,
the cells were washed twice with PBS, transferred to a LabTek 8-well
chambered cover glass, and added with a 1:1 solution of 70% glycerol
and FBS. Imaging was performed on an Olympus FV1000 inverted confocal
laser scanning microscope equipped with a thermostat chamber set at
37 °C and 5% CO2. The lasers for excitation were 405,
488, and 633 nm. Imaging was done 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after incubation.
All images were analyzed using Fiji-ImageJ software version 1.51s.

Bradford Assay
In a 2 mL plastic vial, four to six
cell constructs were collected using 1 mL pipet tips. The cells were
settled and washed three times with cold PBS. For the final washing,
the cells were centrifuged at 13 400 rpm, 4 °C for 10
min. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were added with 50
μL of lysis buffer. The samples were agitated for 1 h. The lysates
were separated by centrifugation at 13 400 rpm, 4 °C for
10 min. The pellets were saved for gold quantification. The Bradford
assay samples were prepared in 1:5 dilution in PBS. The calibration
curve was prepared using bovine serum albumin standards. Samples,
calibration solution, and blank (3 μL) were placed on 96-well
plates, and 150 μL of Bradford assay solution (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was added. The plate was incubated for 10 min at room
temperature, and the absorbance at 595 nm was recorded.

ICP-MS Analysis
Lysates and pellets were combined,
dissolved in 1 mL ICP-MS-grade HNO3, and digested by microwave
irradiation (200 °C/15 min) in borosilicate glass vessels. An
aliquot (200 μL) of the digested sample solution was diluted
to 2 mL with ICP-MS-grade water. The content of gold was determined
by ICP-MS analysis against a standard calibration curve.
