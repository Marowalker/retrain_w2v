This
study reports the synthesis of thin polymeric films by the
layer-by-layer deposition and covalent cross-linking of polyvinyl
dimethylazlactone and polyethylene imine, which were functionalized
with lauric (12-C), myristic (14-C), and palmitic (16-C) saturated
fatty acids, whose high levels in the bloodstream are correlated with
insulin resistance and the potential development of type 2 diabetes
mellitus. Aiming to assess the effect of the fatty acids on the adhesion
and proliferation of Langerhans β-cells, all prepared films
(35 and 35.5 bilayers with and without functionalization with the
fatty acids) were characterized in terms of their physical, chemical,
and biological properties by a battery of experimental techniques
including 1H and 13C NMR, mass spectrometry,
attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy,
cell staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy among others.
In general, the developed films were found to be nanometric, transparent,
resistant against manipulation, chemically reactive, and highly cytocompatible.
On the other hand, in what the effect of the fatty acids is concerned,
palmitic acid was found to impair the proliferation of the cultured
β-cells, contrary to its homologues which did not alter this
biological process. In our opinion, the multidisciplinary study presented
here might be of interest for the research community working on the
development of cytocompatible 2D model substrates for the safe and
reproducible characterization of cell responses.

==== Body
Introduction
The incidence of type
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased
globally because of the sedentary life style and obesity of the population;
therefore, prevention based on the modification of the diet as well
as other healthcare habits is recommended.1 T2DM is a metabolic disease that is produced by high blood glucose
levels related to a low insulin production of the body, a resistance
to its action, an increase in the production of glucose, or a combination
of them.

The increase in glucose production constitutes a state
prior to
the development of T2DM called prediabetes. At this stage, the β-cells
are able to adapt to this hostile environment by increasing their
insulin production, but only for a limited time. Gradually, the function
of insulin deteriorates up until it is depleted, so that blood glucose
levels begin to increase. As the β-cells defect progresses,
blood glucose levels remain steadily high, and this increased glucose
acts as a toxic agent to the pancreas, consuming the insulin the β-cells
have stored inside them, and thus aggravating it. Other factors such
as the increase in plasmatic fatty acids and chronic inflammation
associated with obesity also act against the pancreas, being toxic
for the β-cells. In different models, high levels of free fatty
acids have been proposed like a determinant factor of apoptosis, which,
connected to the degree of saturation, could also induce an inhibition
of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. In particular, saturated fatty
acids such as palmitic and stearic acids have shown to reduce the
cell viability and activate the unfolded protein response pathway,
which is important to maintain cellular homeostasis.2,3 Therefore, methods that allow us to deepen the grasp on the damage
phenomena in β-cells through the implementation of novel strategies/techniques
are critical for the understanding of the physiology of β-cells
and, as a consequence, for the potential development of therapeutic
protocols. One such method is the preparation of 2D platforms with
particular architecture and/or functionality capable of interacting
with and ruling the response of β-cells. An elegant example
of this approach is the design of thin polymeric films with on-demand
surface functionalization using the layer-by-layer (LBL) technique.4 The LBL methods allow the alternate deposition
of polymer layers, resulting in being useful for the coating of different
substrates such as glass, silicon, gold, and other materials. The
main focus is to control with precision the molecular architecture
of the deposited layers, thus controlling as well the physical, chemical
and mechanical properties of the prepared films.5 In the present work, 2D polymeric films with a series of
terminal fatty acids (lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid) were synthesized
using the LBL technique upon the deposition and covalent cross-linking
of alternate layers of polyvinyl dimethylazlactone (PVDMA) and polyethylene
imine (PEI), leaving PEI at the uppermost layer which was functionalized
with the selected fatty acids. The purpose of the study was to assess
the effect of the fatty acids on the surface adhesion and proliferation
of Langerhans β-cells. The developed systems and polymer precursors
were characterized using a battery of experimental techniques including 1H and 13C NMR, mass spectrometry, attenuated total
reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR),
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), atomic force
microscopy (AFM), cell staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) among others.

Results and Discussion
Overview of the Synthesis
Process
The LBL method allows
the generation of multilayer films wherein different groups can be
incorporated within each formed bilayer, which can also be surface-functionalized.6,7 Moreover, it allows the assembly of alternating layers of polymers
on different substrates, providing additional stability and the possibility
to control the film thickness at the micro and nanometric scales.8,9 As such, the LBL assembly constitutes a convenient coating strategy
to modify the surface properties of materials for a plethora of applications,10 such as the deposition of paints against corrosion
or graffiti,11−14 the development of semipermeable membranes,15 and the fabrication of antifouling,16 superhydrophobic,17−21 and slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces.22−27 Of interest to this study, the use of surfaces prepared by LBL for
seeding and growth of model cells has been implemented for different
biomedical purposes, such as in biomaterial implants, for diagnosis,
cell culture, and assessing of unwanted adsorption of proteins and
bacteria on implantable devices, among others.28−32 In this context, previous studies have reported that
the LBL technique can be used to fabricate thin films by the alternate
deposition and covalent cross-linking of PVDMA and PEI.10,33−40Figure 1 schematizes
the synthesis process of our films, by which 35 and 35.5 bilayer films
were developed, as recommended in previous publications.37,38,41

LBL assembly, (B) LBL film

PEI at the uppermost layer (35.5 bilayers).

Validation of Film Reactivity and Covalent Cross-linking
Surface reactivity is an important feature of materials toward their
chemical functionalization with bioactive molecules (fatty acids in
our case) and subsequent application as substrates for cell seeding.41 The surface reactivity of the developed films
was characterized by ATR–FTIR and CLSM at the PVDMA and PEI
layers (upon formation of 35 and 35.5 bilayers, respectively); the
obtained results are shown in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows representative ATR–FTIR spectra
of the films at both layers of interest. The 35 bilayer spectrum (panel
A) shows distinctive bands of PVDMA, PEI, and the PVDMA–PEI
cross-linking, specifically the amine (at ca. 3275 cm–1, from PEI), azlactone (at ca. 1822 cm–1, from
PVDMA), and amide groups (at ca. 1647 cm–1, from
the PVDMA–PEI system). Meanwhile, the 35.5 bilayer spectrum
(panel B) shows the distinctive bands of PEI (3275 cm–1) and PVDMA–PEI crosslinking (1647 cm–1)
merely. Interestingly, the absence of azlactone bands from PVDMA in
the latter spectrum (35.5 bilayers) shows that most of these groups
(not to say all) reacted with the amine groups of PEI during the covalent
cross-linking; on the other hand, the presence of residual amine groups
from PEI reveals the films as reactive for the desired immobilization
of the fatty acids to be carried out in a following step (see below).

and (B) 35.5 bilayers.

Figure 3 shows representative
CLSM micrographs of a 35 bilayer film, upon a postfabrication treatment
of the film with BODIPY-NCH2CH2NH2, a fluorescent dye that emits in the 430–480 nm region (blue).
The portrayed images show a highly ordered multilayered pattern resulting
from the covalent cross-linking between PVDMA and PEI, which was colored
in blue because of the emission of the dye upon reaction with residual
azlactone groups of PVDMA onto the substrate surface. This even ordering
reveals a highly controlled and uniform reaction process. In general,
strong and uniform interactions between the reacting species give
rise to ordered and flat LBL coatings. By contrast, when weak interactions
take place, the coating process results in the formation of thick
layers wherein polymeric chains are not tightly bound one to each
other at the reacting interface, adopting in consequence a loose and
globular surface conformation. Interestingly, whenever nonregular
structures are formed, they become exaggerated upon further LBL cycles.
As compared to previous publications,40 the wavy structures typically described for weakly-interacting LBL
systems were not detected all along our experimental process (see
FESEM and AFM images shown above). Accordingly, these images provide
evidence of both the proper cross-linking between PVDMA and PEI and
the reactivity of the azlactones groups of PVDMA at the uppermost
surface of the 35 bilayer film.

Appearance, Thickness,
and Topography of the Films
Thin and transparent films with
smooth and homogeneous surface features
were obtained, as demonstrated by optical photography, FESEM, and
AFM (see Figure 4).

different length scales: (A) Photograph of a glass slide (control),
(B) photograph of the coated glass slide (film), (C) FESEM image of
a 35 bilayer thin film, and (D) AFM image of a 35 bilayer thin film.

The thickness of the film was determined by FESEM
by measuring
in at least in five different points, giving an average value of 524
nm (Figure 4C, black
label). With respect to the surface features, an even topography was
observed by FESEM and also confirmed by AFM (Figure 4C,D), revealing an average roughness (Sa) of 1.613 ± 0.008 nm, with a mean value
(Sm) of −18.63 fm, and a peak-valley
height (Sy) of 15.11 nm. It is worth mentioning
that the surfaces were also validated as highly resistant against
the routine manipulation by hands and with forceps all along and after
the synthesis process.

Changes in Topography and Film Thickness
upon Functionalization
with Fatty Acids
PVDMA–PEI films (35.5 bilayers) were
functionalized with palmitic, lauric, and stearic acids in order to
assess their effect on the adhesion and proliferation of Langerhans
β-cells. These fatty acids are believed to be involved in metabolic
pathways of Langerhans β-cells related to insulin resistance
and the potential development of T2DM. The obtained functionalized
films were characterized in terms of their topography, roughness,
and water contact angle (WCA), properties that have been proved to
regulate the early protein adsorption onto materials and their following
affinity to cells.42Figure 5 shows representative 2D AFM images and topography
profiles of nonfunctionalized (panels A,C) and palmitic acid-functionalized
films (B,D). The direct comparison of these panels demonstrate that
the topography of the film remains smooth and homogeneous after functionalization,
yielding a roughness increase of ca. 0.33 nm, a rather small noticeable
change. Moreover, as derived from the topography profile (Figure 4D), it was found
that an increment of Sa is close to 21%,
the Sm and Sy values being calculated as −18.23 fm, and 30.35 nm, respectively.
The increase in peak-valley height value is due to the projections
observed in the topography image, which can be assumed as zones of
accumulation of palmitic acid. With respect to the thickness, the
functionalization of the films led to an increment of about 50% from
ca. 500 to 750 nm. This increase in thickness is ascribed to the 16-C
chain of palmitic acid, and this was evaluated with FESEM analysis
(see the Supporting Information).

WCA Measurement
Protein adsorption and subsequent cell
adhesion have been proved to be dependent on the surface wettability
of solid substrates.43 When an exogenous
material comes into contact with a biological system, integrins spontaneously
adsorb onto the surface. With increased integrin recruitment, the
early cell–protein contact leads to the formation of anchoring
complexes at the lamellipodium leading edge that are reinforced intracellularly
to form larger focal adhesion plaques upon increased intra- and extracellular
tension. In general, cells effectively adhere to substrates presenting
moderate wettability with WCA values in the range of 40–90°.42,43 Taking into account this information, we proceeded to characterize
the WCA of the functionalized surfaces.

Table 1 shows the results obtained from the measurement
of the WCA on the different surfaces: glass, reactive film (35.5 bilayers),
and films functionalized with the fatty acids. The obtained results
reflect good surface lipophilicity of the functionalized films, all
of which exhibiting WCA values higher than those of glass. Interestingly,
the surface functionalization with palmitic acid led to the highest
surface lipophilicity among the tested fatty acids (the highest WCA
value), which can fairly be attributed to the longer chain length
of this acid relative to its homologues.

Evaluation of the Effect of Films on β-Cell
Proliferation
Functionalized PVDMA–PEI films have
been used in other reports
to improve the cell function and regulate the cell proliferation,
proving to be robust and stable in physiological environments.44−46 However, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of lipid structures
attached to these films have not yet been evaluated. Previous results
by our group on the culture of pancreatic β-cells in the presence
of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in solution demonstrated
that saturated fatty acids, including palmitic and stearic acid, induced
lipoapoptosis, whereas unsaturated fatty acids showed the opposite
effect, not interfering with β-cell proliferation.2,3 As a step forward in our research, in the present work, we evaluated
the adhesion and proliferation of β-cells onto PVDMA–PEI
films functionalized with lauric, myristic, and palmitic saturated
fatty acids, employing nonfunctionalized surfaces as a control. As
revealed by optical microscopy and CLSM (Figure 6), the developed PVDM–PEI films with
PEI at the uppermost layer (employed as a control in these experiments,
35.5 bilayers) proved to be cytocompatible and optimal for cell culture
in as much as they sustained the adherence and proliferation of β-cells
up until confluence. This outstanding outcome allowed us to evaluate
the effect of the fatty acids in a reproducible way. With respect
to the biological outcome of the immobilized fatty acids, the lauric
(panels E–H) and myristic acids (panels I–L) proved
to preserve cell adhesion and proliferation exhibited by the control
films (panels A–D), not altering either of these biological
processes. Conversely, the palmitic acid was found to impair cell
proliferation, given that cells were validated as adhered and spread
onto the film but did not proliferate up until confluence as observed
with their counterparts (M–P) at the same time lapse (96 h).
Interestingly, this outcome confirms the lipotoxicity associated to
this fatty acid at solution conditions, previously ascribed to alterations
in metabolism homeostasis of β-cells3,47 and
other cell models.48,49

and cell nuclei for CLSM characterization, respectively. Scale bars
in panels (C,G,K,O) and (D,H,L,P) correspond to 100 and 20 μm,
respectively.

Conclusions
Thin
polymeric films were prepared by the LBL deposition and covalent
cross-linking of PVDMA and PEI first and functionalized with lauric,
myristic, and palmitic saturated fatty acids next. The physical, chemical,
and biological properties of all prepared films were evaluated in
order to assess the effect of fatty acids on the adhesion and proliferation
of Langerhans β-cells. In general, all films proved to be transparent
and resistant against manipulation by hand and with forceps, showing
thickness and topography profiles in the nanometric scale. On the
other hand, the surface reactivity of the PVDMA and PEI layers, together
with the proper cross-linking between them, was validated by the presence
of characteristic ATR–FTIR bands of the azlactone (from PVDMA),
amine (from PEI), and amide groups (from the PVDMA–PEI crosslinking),
as also confirmed using the CLSM images upon postproduction treatment
with BODIPY-NCH2CH2NH2 (staining
in blue the VDPMA layers). Finally, the biological characterization
by optical microscopy and CLSM evidenced an impairing effect of palmitic
acid on the cell proliferation, opposite to lauric and myristic acids,
which did not alter this biological process. Taken together, the multidisciplinary
approach here reported reveals the potential of PVDMA–PEI films
functionalized with saturated fatty acids as cytocompatible 2D model
substrates to assess the effect of the acids on the adhesion and proliferation
of β-cells. Moreover, the validation of the impairing effect
of palmitic acid on the cell proliferation, elsewhere ascribed to
be lipotoxicity, might be of interest for the development of clinical
protocols for the treatment of T2DM. The last but not the least, given
the proven reactivity of both PVDMA and PEI layers (holding active
azlactone and amine groups, respectively), the developed films might
also be functionalized with a broad range of biomolecules to study
their effect on additional cell lines. Accordingly, these findings
pave the way for future studies wherein versatile 2D and even 3D substrates
might be considered for deepening the surface effects of functionalized
biomaterials for cell culture.

The
initiator 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) (3.0 mg,
0.02 mmol, 0.01 equiv) was added into a 10 mL Schlenk flask equipped

the flask, and the mixture was stirred until AIBN was dissolved completely.
After that, VDMA (0.8 g, 5.55 mmol, 1 equiv) was added to the flask,
and the flask was capped with a septum and purged with argon for 5
min. The reaction solution was stirred at 70 °C for 16 h. The
viscous reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath to stop polymerization,
acetone (∼1 mL) was added to the flask, the flask was stirred,
and then, hexane was added to precipitate the product. The polymer

LBL Fabrication of Films
Solutions of PEI and PVDMA
were prepared in acetone (20 mM with respect to the molecular weight
of the polymer repeat unit). Films were deposited layer-by-layer on
glass substrates automatically according to the following steps: (1)
glass was submerged in a solution of PEI for 20 s, (2) glass was removed
and immersed in an initial acetone bath for 20 s followed by a second
acetone bath for 20 s, (3) glass was submerged in a solution of PVDMA
for 20 s, and (4) glass was rinsed in the manner described above.
This cycle was repeated until the desired number of PEI–PVDMA
layers was reached; for this study, 35.5 bilayers. Films were either
characterized or used in subsequent experiments, or dried under a
stream of compressed air and stored in a vacuum desiccator until use.
All films were manufactured at ambient room temperature.

Characterization
of Thin Film Reactivity
To evaluate
the reactivity of the films by CLSM, a bilayer film was immersed in
a solution of 10 mg of BODIPY-NCH2CH2NH2 (see the Supporting Information) in 50 mL of DMSO at room temperature for ∼16 h. The film
was washed for 1 h in DMSO, washed with ETOH, and dried with compressed
air before being analyzed by CLSM.

Postfabrication Functionalization
of Thin Films
PEI–PVDMA
films with 35.5 bilayers were functionalized postfabrication by immersing
film-coated substrates in solutions of either stearic, myristic, or
palmitic acid 20 mM in (DMSO, EDC, and HOBT) at room temperature for
∼24 h. Films were soaked in DMSO for ∼1 h after functionalization,
and DMSO was changed at least once during soaking, washed with ETOH,
and dried with compressed air before being analyzed or used to grow
beta cells.

WCA Estimations
The WCA estimations
were carried out
at room temperature employing a 12 MP, f/1.8, 28 mm (wide), PDAF,
OIS 12 MP, f/2.8, 57 mm (telephoto) camera, working with 2× optical
zoom. Static WCA was measured with the Image J software upon deposition
of 5 μL of droplets of deionized water onto the selected films
(2.5 × 2.5 cm2) at three different locations. Data
are reported as the average.

Cell Culture onto PEI–PVDMA
Films
β-Cells
of the islet of Langerhans were seeded onto reactive and fatty acid-functionalized
films (35.5 bilayers). Briefly, the films were washed with 70% EtOH,
placed in Petri dishes, and put under ultraviolet light for 30 min
prior to cell seeding. Subsequently, 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) was added to each film and removed under vacuum (two times)
to eliminate the excess of EtOH. Then, 8 mL of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS, 10 U/mL penicillin, 10 g/mL streptomycin, and 25 μg/mL
amphotericin B were placed in the Petri dish. Subsequently, the cells
with a density of 163,000 cells/mL were seeded onto the films and
incubated for 96 h to allow their adhesion and proliferation. The
cell culture was carried at standard culture conditions in all cases
(37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere).

Optical
Microscopy
Right after the cell incubation
time onto the films was reached (96 h), a batch of the samples were
stained with the Coomassie dye and observed under a photo zoom inverted
microscope (Cambridge Instruments) employing a 10× magnification
lens. Briefly, 5 mL of methanol at −70 °C was added and
under gentle shaking for 10 min. Then, 5 mL of Coomassie (0.03 g/200
mL) was added to each film and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C under
gentle orbital shaking. Finally, the cells were observed after rinsing
twice with cold PBS (1×) and addition of 5 mL of PBS (1×)
inside a Petri dish. Langerhans β-cells were chosen as a model
for the characterization under adherent conditions. This cell line
is of human physiopathological relevance associated with metabolic
overload.33 The cells were bought from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Confocal Laser Scanning
Microscopy
CLSM experiments
were carried out to characterize both the LBL produced films and the
adhered cells. A LEICA TCS-SP8 confocal microscope (LEICA Microsystems
Heidelberg GmbH) was used. Regarding the surfaces, they were characterized
by operating the microscope in the fluorescence and bright field modes.
The excitation/emission wavelengths for the fluorescence mode were
405/430–480 nm (for detection of BODIPY-NCH2CH2NH2, blue channel). Meanwhile, the excitation wavelength
for the bright field mode was 488 nm. On the other hand, concerning
the cells, they were characterized by operating the microscope in
the fluorescence mode exclusively. The experiments were carried out
to characterize the cellular distribution of Aza-BODIPY-(OH)2. For these experiments, a second bath of the cell-seeded films was
washed with PBS (1×), incubated with Aza-BODIPY-(OH)2 (4 μL/mL in DMSO) for 30 min, and washed again twice with
PBS (1×). Then, the films were added with Hoechst dye (0.2 μL/mL
in PBS), incubated for 30 min, and washed again twice with PBS 1×.
Finally, the films were washed four times with cold PBS (1×),
the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS), and then subjected
to observation. Macroscopically different zones were recorded, preferentially
at the center of the specimens, in order to depict representative
images. The images were recorded at the excitation/emission wavelengths
of 405/430–550 (for detection of Hoechst, blue channel) and
638/650–750 (for detection of Aza-BODIPY-(OH)2,
red channel).
