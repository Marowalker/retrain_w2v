N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most
prevalent modification on eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA). Resveratrol
and curcumin, which can exert many health-protective effects, may
have a relationship with m6A RNA methylation. We hypothesized
that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin could affect growth
performance, intestinal mucosal integrity, m6A RNA methylation,
and gene expression in weaning piglets. One hundred and eighty piglets
weaned at 28 ± 2 days were fed a control diet or supplementary
diets (300 mg/kg of antibiotics; 300 mg/kg of each resveratrol and
curcumin; 100 mg/kg of each resveratrol and curcumin; 300 mg/kg of
resveratrol; 300 mg/kg of curcumin) for 28 days. The results showed
that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin improved growth performance
and enhanced intestinal mucosal integrity and functions in weaning
piglets. Resveratrol and curcumin also increased intestinal antioxidative
capacity and mRNA expression of tight junction proteins. Furthermore,
resveratrol and curcumin decreased the content of m6A and
decreased the enrichment of m6A on the transcripts of tight
junction proteins and on heme oxygenase-1 in the intestine. Our findings
indicated that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin increased
growth performance, enhanced intestine function, and protected piglet
health, which may be associated with changes in m6A methylation
and gene expression, suggesting that curcumin and resveratrol may
be a potential natural alternative to antibiotics.

==== Body
Introduction
The intestinal mucosal barrier, which is responsible for nutrient
absorption and immunological stimuli, is very important for the neonate
development and health,1 particularly in
piglets. Due to oxidative stress, nutritional and environmental challenges,
weaning leads to intestinal mucosal barrier impairment, immune function
disruption, diarrhea, growth retardation, and even deaths in piglets.2 Traditionally, antibiotics have been used to
relieve weaning stress in piglets; however, antibiotics were prohibited
from use in animal feeds in the European Union this year because of
concerns about residues in animal products and the potential appearance
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Some natural products can
exert mucosa barrier protecting ability and may have the potential
to improve weaning stress. Resveratrol is a phenylpropanoid compound
present in strongly pigmented vegetables and fruits. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane)
is derived from Curcuma longa (turmeric
plant). Accumulating evidence indicates that these natural products
have immunomodulatory, antioxidative, antiapoptotic, and antiinflammatory
functions.3−5 In addition,
resveratrol and curcumin can protect intestinal epithelial barrier
against dysfunction under oxidative stress and immune challenge.3 However, their utility is limited because of
low bioavailability.6−8 Furthermore,
resveratrol and curcumin regulate many genes expression to exert their
biological function9,10 but the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear.

Among over 100 distinct RNA chemical modifications
identified thus far, N6-methyladenosine
(m6A) is the most abundant internal modification of eukaryotic
messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Dynamic and reversible m6A methylation
is catalyzed by RNA methyltransferase, including methyltransferase-like
3 (METTL3), methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14),11 Wilms tumor 1-associated protein, and demethylases, including
fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and alkylated DNA repair
protein AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5).12 In addition,
m6A binding proteins are predominantly in the YT521-B homology
(YTH) family and contain the YTH domain (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, YTHDC1,
and YTHDC2).13 A growing amount of evidence
indicates that m6A RNA methylation plays a critical role
in the regulation of gene expression for fundamental cellular processes,
including RNA processing, RNA splicing, RNA nucleation, RNA degradation,
and RNA translation.14,15 In addition, m6A methylation
is involved in diverse physiological functions, including obesity,
immunoregulation, stem cell differentiation, and human chronic diseases.16−18 Interestingly, recent studies
showed that a high-fat diet, betaine, and cycloleucine affect the
m6A RNA methylation patterns,19,20 altering
the gene expression, suggesting that nutritional challenge regulates
the dynamic and reversible nature of m6A modification.

Our hypothesis is that resveratrol and curcumin affect growth performance,
m6A methylation, and gene expression in the intestine of
piglets after weaning, and these compounds may have synergistic effects.
We investigated the effect of the combination of resveratrol and curcumin
on growth performance, intestinal morphology, antioxidant activity,
tight junction protein gene expression, the total content of m6A, and the levels of m6A on the transcript. Pigs
are very similar to humans in anatomy, genetics, and physiology; consequently,
pigs are an excellent animal model to study human diseases,21 and therefore, we choose weaned piglets as the
animal model in this experiment.

Materials
and Methods
Animals and Experimental
Design
All of the procedures were carried out in accordance
with the Chinese Guidelines for Animal Welfare and Experimental Protocol
and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Nanjing Agricultural University, China (NJAU-CAST-2015-098). One
hundred and eighty (90 ♂ + 90 ♀) piglets with an initial
body weight of 7.8 ± 0.6 kg (weaned at 28 ± 2 days) were
randomly divided into six groups that were fed a control diet supplemented
with additives as follows: no addition (CON); 159 mg/kg of olaquindox
+ 81 mg/kg of kitasamycin + 60 mg/kg of chlortetracycline (ANT); 300
mg/kg resveratrol and curcumin (HRC); 100 mg/kg resveratrol and curcumin
(LRC); 300 mg/kg of resveratrol (RES); 300 mg/kg of curcumin (CUR),
respectively. All pigs were housed in pens in an environmentally controlled
room (25.0 ± 0.5 °C) and were allowed to consume feed and
water ad libitum. Each treatment had six replicates and five pigs
per replicate. The compositions of the diets are presented in Table S1 and met the NRC (2012) requirements
for nutrition. Curcumin (≥98%) was obtained from the Cohoo
Biotech Research & Development Center (Guangzhou, China). Resveratrol
(CAS number 501-36-0, ≥98%) was purchased from Seebio Bio-technology
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). One
replicate in each group consumed the diet in which the inert marker
yttrium oxide (Y2O3) was added in a percentage
of 0.01% to measure apparent digestibility.22,23 The
average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed
conversion ratio (FCR) of piglets were recorded carefully. Feed leftovers
were collected after each meal and recorded weekly for calculating
average daily feed intake (ADFI). Body weight was recorded weekly
for calculating average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio
(FCR).

Sample Collection
At 42 days of postnatal age, blood samples were obtained by jugular
venipuncture and heparin sodium was added for anticoagulation. At
56 days of postnatal age, one piglet from each replicate was selected
(n = 6). After electrical stunning, blood samples
were collected and centrifuged at 3500g for 15 min
at 4 °C and then stored at −80 °C. After blood collection,
piglets were sacrificed by the exsanguination. The entire small intestine
starting from the pyloric sphincter to the ileocecal valve was removed
from the abdominal cavity and divided into three segments, including
the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The jejunal and ileal segments were
immediately washed with ice-cold physiological saline to remove the
luminal contents. Approximately 1 cm intestine sections from the middle
of jejunum and ileum were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
The middle of jejunal and ileal mucosae was scraped using a glass
microscope slide24 and were then snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis.

Laboratory Analysis
Fecal samples
were collected from each pen. They were dried at 100 °C for 48
h, milled through a 1 mm screen, and homogenized before analysis.
The apparent digestibility of nutrients was calculated as described
previously.25 The diet and fecal samples
were analyzed for Y2O3 concentrations.22,23
Ash was determined after ignition of a known weight of diet or feces
in a muffle furnace at 500 °C and the dry matter (DM) of the
diets/feces was determined after drying overnight at 103 °C.23
The apparent digestibility was determined using the formula  

Intestinal Morphology
The intestinal segments fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde were dried using a graded series of xylene and ethanol
and embedded in paraffin. The samples (5 μm) were then deparaffinized
using xylene and rehydrated with graded dilutions of ethanol. The
slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Six slides for each
tissue were prepared, and the images were acquired using an optical
binocular microscope with a digital camera (Nikon ECLIPSE 80i, Tokyo,
Japan).

Measurement of Intestinal
Enzyme Activities, Plasma d-Lactate, and Diamine Oxidase
(DAO)
The plasma DAO activity and the level of d-lactate were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit
(Shanghai Yili Biological Technology Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). The
activities of intestine glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), and the concentrations of glutathione (GSH), oxidized
glutathione (GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity
(T-AOC), sucrase, maltase, and lactase were determined using the commercial
kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, Jiangsu,
China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All results
were normalized to the total protein concentration in each sample
for intersample comparison. The protein concentrations were quantified
using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).

Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA from intestinal mucosa was isolated using TRIzol reagent
(Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). DNase was added
to remove contaminant DNA. After the quantification and unified concentration,
total RNA was reversed-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using
a reverse transcription kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu,
China). The primer sequences are listed in Table S2 and synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
The cDNA was amplified using the ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme
Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). The relative gene expression
was calculated by the 2–ΔΔCT method after normalization to β-actin.

m6A Immunoprecipitation (IP)
and Gene-Specific m6A qRT-PCR
The relative abundance
of occludin (OCLN), claudin 1 (CLDN1), zonula occluden (ZO-1), and
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA in m6A antibody IP samples
and input samples was assessed by qRT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated
from mucosa with TRIzol reagent (Vazyme) followed by polyadenylated
RNA extraction using Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT (Invitrogen) kit. A 200
ng aliquot of mRNA was saved as input samples. The remaining mRNA
was used for m6A-immunoprecipitation as given in Dominissini
et al.14 and Zhong et
al.26 A 5 μg aliquot of mRNA was
incubated with m6A antibody (Abcam) in IP buffer (10 mM
Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Igepal CA-630) supplemented
with RNase inhibitor (Fermentas) for 2 h at 4 °C. Dynabeads Protein
A (Invitrogen) was added to the solution and rotated for an additional
2 h at 4 °C. After washing with IP buffer, mRNA was eluted from
the beads via incubation in 300 mL elution buffer (0.1 M NaCI, 10
mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.05% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 200 mg/mL proteinase K) for 1.5 h at 50 °C.
Finally, m6A IP mRNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation,
purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, and analyzed by qRT-PCR.
Primer sequences are listed in Table S3.

Quantification of m6A by Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
Messenger RNA was subjected to liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for the determination of m6A as previously described.13,26 Briefly, 100–200
ng of mRNA was digested by P1 nuclease (Fisher Scientific) in 25 μL
of buffer containing 2.0 mM ZnCl2 and 10 mM NaCl for 2
h at 37 °C. Subsequently, 1 μL of alkaline phosphatase
and 2.5 μL of NH4HCO3 were added and the
sample was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The sample was then diluted
with 75 μL of RNase-free water and filtered through a 0.22 mm
poly(vinylidene fluoride) filter (Millipore). Finally, the sample
was injected into a C18 reverse-phase column coupled on-line to Agilent
6410 triple-quadrupole LC mass spectrometer in multiple reactions
monitoring positive electrospray ionization mode. The nucleosides
were quantified using the nucleoside to base ion mass transitions
of 282.1–150.1 (m6A) and 268.0–136.0 (A). Concentrations
of nucleosides in mRNA samples were deduced by fitting the signal
intensities into the stand curves. The ratios of m6A/A
were subsequently calculated.

Western
Blotting
Proteins were extracted from frozen ileum mucosa
by grinding with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer and phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride. BCA assay kit was used to measure the protein concentrations.
Thereafter, 40 μg of protein/lane was electrophoresed in 4–12%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels followed by transfer to
poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes and blocking with 5% nonfat
dry milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 buffer for 1 h. After blocking,
the membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at
4 °C. The primary antibodies were β-actin (1:7000, 60008-1-AP;
Proteintech, Rosemont, IL), METTL3 (1:1000, 15073-1-AP; Proteintech),
and YTHDF2 (1:500, 24744-1-AP; Proteintech). The membranes were washed
in TBST five times and were processed with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, 1:10 000; Proteintech) for 90
min at room temperature. The blots were developed using an enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Merck Millipore) followed by autoradiography.
Images were recorded using a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-4000 system
(Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and were quantified by Image-Pro Plus 6.0.
β-Actin
was used as the internal standard to normalize the signals.

Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed
as mean with standard error of mean (SEM) and analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance using the SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago,
IL). Differences among group mean were determined by Tukey–Kramer
multiple range test. P < 0.05 was considered as
statistically significant.

(Figure 1A) but there
was no difference among the ANT, HRC, LRC, RES, and CUR groups. No
change in crypt depth was observed in the jejunum of piglets (Figure 1B). The villus height/crypt

We observed that plasma d-lactate was lower in the ANT
group than that in the CON and LRC groups, and the activity of diamine
oxidase (DAO) was decreased in the ANT group compared to the CON and
RES groups at 14 days after weaning (P < 0.05)
(Figure 2A). Piglets
in the ANT, RES, and CUR groups showed a decreased level of both plasma d-lactate and activity of DAO compared to the CON group at 28
days after weaning (Figure 2B).

Intestinal Antioxidant
Capacity and Disaccharidase Activity
The activity of lactase
was higher in the ANT, HRC, LRC, RES, and CUR groups than that in
the CON group in the jejunum (P < 0.05) (Figure 2C). In the ileum,
the activity of lactase in the ANT, HRC, and RES groups was increased
compared to that in the CON group (Figure 2D). In the jejunum and ileum, sucrase activity
was higher (P < 0.05) in the HRC group than that
in the other groups. We only observed increased maltase activity in
the RES group in the ileum (P < 0.05).

Compared
with the CON group, the content of GSH was higher (P < 0.05) in the ANT, HRC, LRC and RES groups in the jejunum (Table 2), and in the ANT,
LRC, and RES groups in the ileum, respectively. The content of GSSG
decreased in the HRC, RES and CUR groups in both the jejunum and ileum
(P < 0.05). The levels of MDA were lower (P < 0.05) in the ANT, HRC, and CUR groups in the jejunum
and also decreased in the ANT, HRC, LRC, RES, and CUR groups compared
to the CON group in the ileum. We observed that higher (P < 0.05) GSH/GSSG ratio in the HRC, RES, and CUR groups in the
jejunum and also in the HRC, LRC, RES, and CUR group in the ileum,
respectively. The activity of SOD was increased (P < 0.05) in the HRC and RES groups in the jejunum but did not
change in the ileum. The activity of T-AOC was higher in the ANT and
RES groups compared to the CON, HRC, LRC, and CUR groups in the ileum
(P < 0.05).

m6A Level and m6A Enrichment in Transcript
The content of m6A
was decreased in the jejunum in RES groups compared to that of the
other groups (Figure 6A). In the ileum, the m6A levels of the ANT, HRC, LRC,
RES, and CUR groups were decreased when compared with that of the
CON group. In particular, the combination of resveratrol and curcumin
at high doses further decreased the content of m6A in the
ileum (P < 0.05).

In the jejunum, supplementation
of resveratrol and curcumin significantly decreased the m6A enrichment in ZO-1 and HO-1 mRNA
compared to the CON and ANT groups (P < 0.05)
in the jejunum but there was no change in OCLN and CLDN1 gene (Figure 6B). In the ileum, the ANT, RES, and CUR additional group showed
a decreased level of the m6A enrichment in OCLN and ZO-1 mRNA compared to the CON group (Figure 6A). The m6A enrichment of CLDN1 and HO-1
gene was lower (P < 0.05) in the HRC, LRC, RES,
and CUR groups than the CON and ANT groups, but there was no difference
(P > 0.05) between the CON and ANT groups in the
ileum (Figure 6B).

Discussion
Resveratrol and
curcumin may have an impact on the weaned piglet growth performance
and the intestinal mucosal barrier functions, as well as the gene
expression. Here, we observed that dietary supplementation with resveratrol
and curcumin improved piglet ADG, ADFI, and FCR, influenced the apparent
digestibility of nutrients, promoted intestinal mucosa growth, and
improved intestinal mucosal integrity in weaning piglets, particularly
in combination of resveratrol and curcumin at high doses. In addition,
the gene expression levels of intestinal antioxidants gene and tight
junction protein gene were increased, and the relative m6A/A level and the m6A enrichment were decreased in the
ileum. Thus, we hypothesized that dietary supplementation with resveratrol
and curcumin can decrease the N6-methyladenosine
level in weaned piglet intestine, then influence intestinal mucosa
permeability and improve intestinal antioxidative ability, and, ultimately,
affect their growth.

Accumulating evidence has identified the
beneficial effects of resveratrol and curcumin on animal health and
disease, including an increase in growth performance and improvement
in intestinal function,3,27,28 but
these functions are utility limited because of low bioavailability.
For the first time, we determined the effect of a combination of resveratrol
and curcumin on growth performance and intestinal function in weaning
piglets. In the present study, low levels of resveratrol and curcumin
in combination did not exert beneficial effects on growth and intestinal
health in weaning piglets; however, the combination of resveratrol
and curcumin at high doses increased growth performance, antioxidant
activity, and intestinal mucosal integrity, suggesting that resveratrol
and curcumin may have synergistic effects. Low bioavailability also
limits the applications of resveratrol and curcumin because of their
similar characteristics: extremely hydrophobic, poor absorption, and
fast systemic elimination.6,7 However, researchers
have found that the combined use of resveratrol and curcumin may have
mutual effects on improving their bioavailability.29,30 Resveratrol
and curcumin should combine with plasma proteins to exert their functions
because they are extremely hydrophobic; however, curcumin and resveratrol
can improve the content of plasma protein, which may be the underlying
mechanism of how they exert their mutual effects.31 In addition, in our previous study, we found that resveratrol
and curcumin can regulate intestinal bacteria in weaned piglets,32 and gut microbiota plays an important role in
curcumin and resveratrol metabolism and biotransformation. Probiotics
may have beneficial effects on the mucosa, and33,34 better
mucosa environment also helps resveratrol and curcumin absorption.
In addition, the present data showed that beneficial effects of resveratrol
and curcumin on the intestinal function and gene expression in the
ileum are better than those in the jejunum, which may be due to the
higher concentration of resveratrol and its metabolite in the ileum
than that in the jejunum.35

N6-methyladenine (m6A), as the most
prevalent internal RNA methylation in eukaryotic mRNA, plays critical
roles in regulating the expression of genes in fundamental cellular
processes, including pri-mRNA splicing, mRNA nuclear transport, molecular
stability, translation, and subcellular localization. In addition,
m6A methylation is involved in diverse physiological functions,
including obesity,36 immunoregulation,
circadian rhythm,26 cellular differentiation,37 antitumor,38 and
other human diseases.39 Interestingly,
due to the dynamic and reversible nature of m6A modification,
nutritional challenges, such as high-fat diet, dietary fasted state,
and supplementation of the diet with betaine and cycloleucine, have
been shown to affect the m6A RNA methylation patterns,
altering the gene expression.20 Furthermore,
resveratrol and curcumin can affect the nutrient absorbance by affecting
the intestinal flora,40,41 which may have a potential connection
with m6A. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the combination
of resveratrol and curcumin decreased the content of m6A in the intestinal mucosal of weaning piglets. Decrease of m6A may be associated with inhibition of oxidative stress by
resveratrol and curcumin since oxidative or heat stress can increase
the m6A levels.15 Moreover,
the effects of resveratrol and curcumin on m6A methylation
may be associated with changes in microRNA since increasing evidence
indicates that curcumin changes the expression profiles of microRNA
in vivo and in vitro,9 and that the formation
of m6A is modulated by microRNAs through regulating METTL3
selectively binding to mRNA substrates.42 We also found that the levels of m6A on OCLN, CLDN1,
ZO-1, and HO-1 transcript reduced in the intestinal mucosal of weaning
piglets. Decrease of m6A modification on genes promotes
mRNA stability,43 leading to upregulation
of gene expression, which is consistent with the expression of OCLN,
CLDN1, ZO-1, and HO-1 mRNA.

Interestingly, we also found that
the level of m6A/A was decreased in the ANT group; the
underlying mechanism might be that antibiotics inhibit the proliferation
of Gram-negative bacteria. After weaning, Gram-negative bacteria proliferate
in large numbers, and the impaired intestinal epithelium leads to
the release of endotoxin into the intestinal mucosa and systematic
circulation and then accumulates in the liver.44 Researchers have found that intraperitoneal injection of
lipopolysaccharide leads to an increased level of liver m6A in chicken45 and weaned piglets.21 The decreased intestinal bacterial population
may be one of the causes of decreased m6A levels in the
intestinal mucosa.

In conclusion, dietary supplementation with
resveratrol and curcumin can enhance the growth performance of weaned
piglets, the apparent nutrient digestibility, and can improve intestinal
mucosal integrity, particularly in the group treated with the combination
of resveratrol and curcumin at high doses. Furthermore, resveratrol
and curcumin can decrease the content of mucosa m6A, which
may promote mRNA stability, leading to an increase in the gene expression
of tight junction proteins and antioxidant gene. The beneficial effects
of resveratrol and curcumin still need further investigation, and
our findings may be helpful in exploring a new natural product as
an alternative antibiotic in healthcare products.
