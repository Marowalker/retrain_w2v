Poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-stabilized
Pd nanoparticles (PTFE-PdNPs)
were prepared in water with 4-methylphenylboronic acid as a reductant
and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and inductively
coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Small PdNPs
with a fairly uniform size were obtained in the presence of PTFE,
whereas aggregation of palladium was observed in the absence of PTFE.
PTFE-PdNPs showed high catalytic activity for the Suzuki coupling
reaction in water and were reused without any loss of activity. No
palladium species were observed by ICP-AES analysis in the reaction
solution after the reaction, nor was any change in particle size observed
after the recycle experiment. PTFE-PdNPs also exhibited excellent
catalytic activity and reusability for the Heck reaction in water.
Although palladium species were not detected in the reaction solution
after the reaction, aggregates and smaller sizes of PdNPs were observed
in the TEM image of the recovered catalyst. PTFE was also useful as
the stabilizer of rhodium nanoparticles (RhNPs) prepared by reduction
with NaBH4. PTFE-RhNPs showed high catalytic activity and
reusability toward arene hydrogenation under mild conditions.

Introduction
In the past several
decades, chemical transformations in aqueous
media have attracted tremendous attention from both academic researchers
and industrial scientists because of advantages such as reaction rate
acceleration and work-up procedure simplification.1,2 In
addition, water is safe, abundant, nontoxic, and inexpensive. The
exploration of catalytic reactions with metal nanoparticle-based heterogeneous
catalysts in neat water is increasing dramatically, because they exhibit
unique surface properties, high specific surface areas, and high catalytic
activities in water.3−5 One major drawback, however, is that metal nanoparticles
tend to lose their catalytic activity during use. This is a consequence
of the formation of aggregates, owing to their high surface energy,
via so-called Ostwald ripening. For this reason, a number of different
solid support materials for metal nanoparticles have been investigated,
including natural polymers,6−12 synthetic polymers,13−18 surfactants,19,20 inorganic supports,21,22 metal–organic frameworks,23,24 covalent organic
frameworks,25,26 and mesoporous supports.27−29

Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of organic halides
with organo-boronic acids (Suzuki coupling reaction)30 and olefins (Heck reaction)31 for carbon–carbon bond formation are extremely useful to
the chemical industry and in research. Both reactions are efficient
methods to construct the sp2 C–sp2 C
bond with high tolerance to the presence of functional groups as the
substituents and have been frequently used to evaluate the catalytic
activity of the developed palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs).6−10,13,15,19,21 For example,
Dewan et al. reported a green and economical synthesis of PdNPs, which
showed high catalytic activity for the Suzuki coupling reaction at
room temperature.12 Arene hydrogenation
has taken part in the facile production of substituted cyclohexane
derivatives on both laboratory and industrial scales.32 One of the most useful transition metal as a catalyst is
rhodium, and the hydrogenation of aromatic rings in water with rhodium
nanoparticles (RhNPs) was also reported recently.33,34

On the basis of the idea that metal nanoparticles with a fairly
uniform size would be stabilized on polymer supports by hydrophobic
interactions in water, our group successfully developed linear polystyrene
(PS)-stabilized metal nanoparticles with applications to several reactions
in water.35−38 Linear PS-stabilized metal nanoparticles, however, could not be
used for the reaction including C–H activation of aromatic
ring and hydrogenation of aromatic ring because PS was used as a support.
Whereas, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)–PS core–shell
nanospheres were obtained from emulsifier-free styrene emulsion polymerization
in water in the presence of PTFE latexes as seeds.39 RhNPs can easily be deposited on the PTFE surface of the
magnetic stir bar by stirring them in an RhNPs/BMImBF4 dispersion
at room temperature.40 According to these
reports, we chose PTFE as a new polymer support and examined the catalytic
activity of PTFE-supported Pd and RhNPs for the Suzuki coupling reaction,
Heck reaction, and arene hydrogenation in water.

Results and Discussion
PTFE-stabilized PdNPs (PTFE-PdNPs) were prepared according to our
previous method for PS-stabilized PdNPs.35 A mixture of Pd(OAc)2, 4-methylphenylboronic acid, and
PTFE was added to a 1.5 mol/L aqueous KOH solution. After the mixture
was stirred vigorously (1350 rpm) at 90 °C for 5 h, the solution
became colorless and a black precipitate formed. An X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern for the black precipitate is presented in Figure 1. In addition to the diffraction
peak at 2θ = 18° ascribed to PTFE, other diffraction peaks
assigned to Pd are observed. The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image indicated that particles with uniform sizes of 2.7 ±
0.4 nm were formed by this preparation method (Figure 2). In contrast, although the nanoparticle
size was similar, most of the Pd formed aggregates when PdNPs were
prepared in the absence of PTFE, suggesting PTFE acted as the stabilizer
for PdNPs (Figure 3). Unfortunately, we could not confirm any obvious differences between
PTFE and PTFE-PdNPs in the Fourier-transform infrared spectra. However,
another broad peak was observed in addition to the peak ascribed to
PTFE in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. When the XPS
analysis for Pd 3d spectra of PTFE-PdNPs was conducted, the existence
of several kinds of Pd species would be estimated and it was difficult
to confirm the interaction between Pd and PTFE (Figure S1). In contrast, fluorine has more a partial positive
charge because of the coordination to PdNPs, thereby justifying the
shifting of the peak position to a higher energy range in PTFE-PdNPs.
That is, it is considered that PdNPs would be immobilized on PTFE
through the interaction with fluorine (Figure 4). The loading of Pd determined by inductively
coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was 2.59 mmol/g.

To evaluate the catalytic activity
of the PTFE-PdNPs, the Suzuki
coupling reaction and the Heck reaction were carried out in water.
When the reaction of bromobenzene with 4-methylphenylboronic acid
was performed in a 1.5 mol/L KOH aqueous solution at 80 °C for
1 h in the presence of PTFE-PdNPs (1.0 mol % Pd based on bromobenzene),
an 86% yield of 4-methylbiphenyl was obtained (Table 1, entry 1). After washing with water and
diethyl ether and subsequent drying, the recovered catalyst was used
for the next run under the same conditions. The catalyst was recycled
at least nine times without any loss of activity (entries 2 and 3).
No palladium species were observed in the reaction solution after
the reaction, as confirmed by ICP-AES. Similarly sized PdNPs and no
aggregates were observed by TEM after the recycling experiments (Figure 5).

Both the electron-rich
and electron-deficient aryl bromides were
reactive, affording the desired coupling products in high to moderate
yields (entries 4–6). The low yield in the case of 4-bromonitrobenzene
would be caused by the reaction of 4-bromonitrobenzene with the catalyst
would be solid–solid reaction because of the high melting point
of 4-bromonitrobenzene. Indeed, the coupling product was obtained
in 95% yield when performing the reaction in the presence of tetrabutylammonium
bromide (TBAB) (entry 7). When the Suzuki coupling reaction was performed
using several arylboronic acids, the yield of the coupling product
decreased with decreasing electron density on the aromatic ring (entries
8–10).

We next investigated the catalytic activity of
PTFE-PdNPs for the
Heck reaction in water. The coupling of iodobenzene with styrene took
place smoothly in water at 90 °C in the presence of PTFE-PdNPs
(1.0 mol % Pd based on iodobenzene) and TBAB to give (E)-stilbene in 91% yield (Table 2, entry 1). When the recyclability of the catalyst
was examined under the same conditions, a slight catalytic deactivation
was observed (entries 2–5). No detectable palladium species
were observed by ICP-AES analysis in the reaction solution after the
reaction. From the TEM image of the recovered catalyst, several aggregates
(>5 nm) and a polymer portion in which PdNPs are not present were
observed (circled areas in Figure 6a,b, respectively). The PdNPs in the recovered catalyst
were slightly smaller than those in the fresh catalyst (Figure 6c). These data suggest that
Ostwald ripening occurred during the reaction. A variety of aryl iodides
were also successfully coupled with styrene to afford the desired
product in good yields (entries 6–9). Although coupling products
were obtained in excellent yields from the reaction with 4-chlorostyrene
(entries 10–14), moderate yields were observed in the case
of 4-methoxystyrene (entries 15–19).

PTFE-stabilized
RhNPs were prepared using NaBH4 as a
reductant in the presence of TBAB. The formation of PTFE-RhNPs was
confirmed by TEM and XRD (Figures 7 and 8). The loading value of
Rh (2.52 mmol/g) was estimated by elemental analysis because RhNPs
did not dissolve completely in acidic solution.

When the mixture of n-octylbenzene
and PTFE-RhNPs
(1.5 mol % Rh based on n-octylbenzene) was stirred
at room temperature in water under H2 pressure (6 atm)
for 15 h, a 97% yield of cyclohexyloctane was obtained. After the
first reaction, PTFE-RhNPs were recovered and successively subjected
to a second through fifth run under the same conditions to afford
the desired products in 96, 96, 95, and 97% yields, respectively (Scheme 1). ICP-AES analysis
confirmed that the aqueous phase contained barely detectable levels
of Rh. However, a larger RhNP size (3.1 ± 0.6 nm) and a broader
size distribution were found by TEM observations of the recovered
catalyst (Figure 9).

Conclusions
In
summary, PTFE-stabilized Pd and RhNPs were prepared. Most Pd
species aggregated when the reduction was performed in the absence
of PTFE, indicating that PTFE was a useful stabilizer for metal nanoparticles.
PTFE-PdNPs had high catalytic activity and reusability for the Suzuki
coupling reaction and the Heck reaction in water. PTFE-RhNPs showed
high catalytic activity for the reduction of aromatic rings in water,
and the catalyst was reused without any loss of catalytic activity.
PTFE was a stable support under the Suzuki coupling reaction conditions
because no increase in the size of PdNPs was observed after the reaction.
In contrast, the stability of PdNPs on PTFE was not as high under
the conditions for the Heck reaction and in the hydrogenation of aromatic
rings.

Experimental Section
General Comments
1H NMR
spectra in CDCl3 were recorded with a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer
(JNM-ECZ400,
JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using tetramethylsilane (δ = 0) as
an internal standard. An ICPS-8100 (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) was
used to perform ICP-AES analysis. A JEM 2100F transmission electron
microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used to confirm the size
of metal nanoparticles. The samples were prepared by placing a drop
of the solution on carbon-coated copper grids and allowed to dry in
air. The reaction was performed using HE-20GB (Koike Precision Instruments,
Hyogo, Japan). TSKgel standard PS was purchased from Tosoh Co., Ltd.
(Tokyo, Japan). Pd(OAc)2, RhCl3, and PTFE (powder,
1 μm particle size) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Missouri,
USA).

Preparation of PTFE-PdNPs
Pd(OAc)2 (8.4
mg, 37.5 μmol), 11.3 mg of PTFE (0.113 mmol of TFE unit), 15.3
mg of 4-methylphenylboronic acid (0.11 mmol), and an aqueous KOH solution
(1.5 mol/L, 3 mL) were added to a screw-capped vial (no. 1, Maruemu
Co., Osaka, Japan) with a stirring bar. After stirring vigorously
(1350 rpm) at 90 °C for 5 h, the solid and the aqueous solution
were separated by centrifugation. PTFE-stabilized PdNPs (13.3 mg)
were obtained after washing with an aqueous KOH solution (1.5 mol/L,
1.0 mL × 5), methanol (1.0 mL × 3), and diethylether (1.0
mL × 5).

Determination of Loading of Pd
PTFE-PdNPs
(1.2 mg)
were placed in a screw-capped vial (no. 7, Maruemu Co., Osaka, Japan)
and then added nitric acid (13 M, 5 mL). In case Pd species are difficult
to dissolve, the mixture was heated at 80 °C. After dissolving
Pd species, the solution was adjusted to 50 mL by distilled water
and then measured the amount of Pd metal by ICP-AES analysis (6.40
ppm, 3.11 μmol Pd).

After the catalytic reaction, the
aqueous phase was adjusted to 10 mL with hydrochloric acid (1 M),
and then, ICP-AES analysis was conducted.

Preparation of PTFE-RhNPs
PTFE (11.3 mg, 0.113 mmol
of TFE unit), 242 mg of TBAB (0.75 mmol), 4.0 M aqueous solution of
RhCl3 (9.38 μL, 37.5 μmol), and water (2 mL)
were added to a screw-capped vial (no. 1, Maruemu Co., Osaka, Japan)
with a stirring bar. To the mixture which was being stirred vigorously
(1350 rpm) at 25 °C was added methanol solution of NaBH4 (0.375 mol/L, 1 mL) dropwise, further stirred for 1 h, and then,
the solid and the aqueous solution were separated by centrifugation.
PTFE-stabilized RhNPs (14 mg) were obtained after washing with water
(1.0 mL × 5), methanol (1.0 mL × 1), and diethylether (1.0
mL × 3). The results of elemental analysis of PTFE-RhNPs are
as follows: C (%): 17.35; N (%): 1.39; F (%): 55.37.

Typical Procedures
for the Suzuki Coupling Reaction
PTFE-PdNPs (2.0 mg, 1.0
mol % Pd based on bromobenzene), 4-methylphenylboronic
acid (102 mg, 0.75 mmol), bromobenzene (78.5 mg, 0.5 mmol), and 1.5
mol/L aqueous KOH solution (1 mL) were added to a screw-capped vial
(no. 02, Maruemu Co., Osaka, Japan) with a stirring bar. After stirring
vigorously (1350 rpm) at 80 °C for 1 h under air, the vial was
immersed in water (∼20 °C) for about 10 min to cool the
reaction mixture to room temperature. After separating the catalyst
and the aqueous solution by centrifugation, the recovered catalyst
was washed with H2O (3.0 mL × 5) and diethyl ether
(3.0 mL × 5), then dried in vacuo, and reused. The aqueous solution
was extracted eight times with diethyl ether. The combined organic
extracts were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporation
of the solvent afforded the desired product. Characterization of the
product was established by comparison of their 1H NMR spectra
with those of authentic samples. Furthermore, the amount of Pd metal
in the aqueous phase measured by ICP-AES was <0.1 ppm.

Typical Procedures
for the Heck Reaction
PTFE-PdNPs
(2.0 mg, 1.0 mol % Pd based on iodobenzene), TBAB (161 mg, 0.5 mmol),
iodobenzene (102 mg, 0.5 mmol), styrene (78.1 mg, 0.75 mmol), and
1.5 mol/L aqueous KOH solution (1 mL) were added to a screw-capped
vial (no. 02, Maruemu Co., Osaka, Japan) with a stirring bar. After
stirring vigorously (1350 rpm) at 90 °C for 15 h under air, the
vial was immersed in water (∼20 °C) for about 10 min to
cool the reaction mixture to room temperature. After separating the
catalyst and the aqueous solution by centrifugation, the recovered
catalyst was washed with 1.5 mol/L aqueous KOH solution (3.0 mL ×
3), diethyl ether (3.0 mL × 5), and methanol (3.0 mL × 3),
then dried in vacuo, and reused. The aqueous solution was extracted
eight times with diethyl ether. The combined organic extracts were
dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporation of the solvent
afforded the desired product. Characterization of the product was
established by comparison of their 1H NMR spectra with
those of authentic samples. Furthermore, the amount of Pd metal in
the aqueous phase measured by ICP-AES was <0.1 ppm.

Typical Procedures
for the Hydrogenation of n-Octylbenzene
To a test tube with a stirring bar were added
PTFE-RhNPs (6.0 mg, 1.5 mol % Rh based on n-octylbenzene), n-octylbenzene (190 mg, 1.0 mmol), and water (3 mL). The
test tube was then placed into a steel autoclave (TVS-1, Taiatsu Techno
Co., Tokyo, Japan). After stirring at room temperature for 15 h under
H2 pressure (6 atm), the catalyst and the aqueous solution
were separated by centrifugation. The recovered catalyst was washed
with diethyl ether (3.0 mL × 3), then dried in vacuo, and reused.
The aqueous solution was extracted eight times with diethyl ether.
The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporation of the solvent afforded the desired product. Characterization
of the product was established by comparison of their 1H NMR spectra with those of authentic samples. Furthermore, the amount
of Rh metal in the aqueous phase measured by ICP-AES was <0.1 ppm.
