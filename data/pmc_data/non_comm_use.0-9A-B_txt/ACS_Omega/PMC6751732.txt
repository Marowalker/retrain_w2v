New
neutral organic superbases with 1-azaazulene(s) as a molecular
backbone are computationally designed, employing two basic substituents:
dimethylaminocyclopropen-imines (CPI) and dimethylaminocyclopropeniminophosphazenes
(CPI-P). Their proton affinities, gas basicities, and pKa values in acetonitrile are obtained using density functional
theory. Azaazulenes substituted with CPI have a computed PA in the
gas phase ranging between 272.9 and 306.8 kcal mol–1, with pKa values in acetonitrile between
28.8 and 36 units. The substitution with the CPI-P group resulted
in even stronger superbases, with a PA from 296.5 to 335.2 kcal mol–1 and corresponding pKa values from 33.9 to 50 units. This exceptionally strong thermodynamic
basicity is accompanied by very high kinetic basicity as well; contrary
to typical proton sponges, the release of a proton from the conjugate
superbase does not demand high activation energy. Because synthetic
routes for both substituents and azaazulenes are already known, newly
designed superbases represent suitable targets for synthesis and application.

1 Introduction
Neutral
organic bases are compounds extensively used as catalysts
in synthetic organic chemistry, due to their ability to initiate a
reaction by spontaneous deprotonation of reagents.1 The important advantages of neutral organic bases over
their ionic inorganic counterparts are much better solubility in organic
solvents and milder reaction conditions. Organic compounds that are
more basic than the proton sponge 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene
(DMAN), with a proton affinity (PA) of 245.3 kcal mol–1 and a gas basicity (GB) of 239 kcal mol–1, are
called superbases.2 From the structural
point of view, the general definition of superbases characterizes
them as bases composed of multiple basic units.3 A great majority of neutral organic superbases known so
far are nitrogen bases, as pointed out in a recent comprehensive review
article by Raczyńska et al.4 where
the gas phase basicity of various nitrogen bases including organic
compounds, but also some biomolecules, is analyzed, based mostly on
the experimental data. However, there are some examples of prepared
superbases where carbon or phosphorus acts as a basicity center5−7 and recently very strong silylene superbases have been designed
computationally.8 A theoretical design
of organic superbases along with computational elucidation of effects
responsible for their superbasic properties represent a vital stage
for synthesis and a range of application of these compounds, as emphasized
in an earlier review article by Maksić et al.9 Although the great number of neutral organic superbases
is already available, most of them are still not as basic as inorganic
bases such as lithium diisopropylamide whose pKa in tetrahydrofuran is 35.7.10 For
comparison, pKa of the strongest commercially
available superbase, phosphazene tBu-P4, in tetrahydrofuran
is 33.9.7b Moreover, theoretical investigation
of fundamental thermochemistry of neutral organic superbases and exploration
of basicity limits can offer insights needed for the design of new
reagents and new chemical reactions in synthetic organic chemistry.

Depending on basic functional groups present in a molecule, neutral
organic (super)bases may be grouped into several classes: amines,1,4 amidines,11 guanidines,12 phosphazenes,13 pyridines,14 phosphines,7b,15 and cyclopropenimines16 (Scheme 1). A combination of these functionalities enables obtaining
even more basic compounds, such as cyclopropeniminoguanidines,17 guanidinophosphazenes,18 and cyclopropeniminophosphazenes,17b,19 also shown
in Scheme 1. Superbase
DMAN, synthesized by Alder fifty years ago,20 represents a special example of an amine with two dimethylamino
substituents at positions 1 and 8 of naphthalene. Because of the repulsion
of electron pairs on nitrogen atoms, the neutral form of the molecule
is destabilized; however, in a protonated form this repulsive interaction
diminishes, which has a positive effect on basicity. Protonation also
induces the formation of an intramolecular H-bond which additionally
stabilizes the protonated form, thus leading to further increase of
basicity. On the other side, the proximity of amino groups induces
a proton shielding,21,22 which means that once the proton
is captivated into the molecule, it cannot be easily released. This
behavior, which is typical of bases similar to DMAN where the aromatic
backbone enables proximity of basic substituents, is the reason why
this type of superbases is called proton sponges. Pozharskii et al.
extensively investigated different naphthalene-based proton sponges
and its analogs, including those with expanded N-alkyl groups and
N-substituents other than alkyl groups,23a chiral proton sponges,23b proton sponges
with different ortho-substituents (e.g., based on tertiary alcohols)23c that interact with dimethylamino groups. It
is interesting that some naturally occurring compounds, like mycosporine-like
amino acid named porphyra-33424a and aplicyanines,24b also act as proton
sponges. The kinetic inertness of typical proton sponges in some cases
limits their use as basic catalysts in organic synthesis.22c

Scheme 1 Main Classes of Neutral Organic (Super)bases
The computational investigation of the basicity
of superbases that
contain substituents based on 1,2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-cyclopropenimine (in further text CPI) predicted
that they should be more basic than guanidines1,2,9 and possibly even phosphazenes.13 In 2010 a convenient two-step synthesis of cyclopropenimines
was reported by Alcarazo and co-workers,25 which encouraged further research and development of superbasic
compounds with a cyclopropenimine motif. The synthesis of the enantioselective
Brønsted base organocatalyst 2,3-bis(di-isopropylamino)cyclopropenimine16c confirmed the theoretical predictions of its
solution basicity with a pKa measured
in acetonitrile of 26.90, which is indeed more basic than guanidines
(pKa of analogous guanidine 23.56). Subsequently,
proton sponges with CPI as pincer ligands were prepared too.26 Superbases containing cyclopropenimino functionality
owe their high basicity to the aromatic stabilization of the cyclopropenium
cation that is formed upon protonation of the system, as shown in Scheme 2.27

Scheme 2 Formation of a Cyclopropenium Cation
The combination of CPI and phosphazene moieties results
in “higher-order
cyclopropenimino superbases”,17b cyclopropeniminophosphazenes (CPI-P), compounds that are more basic
than each of its components taken separately. One such superbase,
consisting of phosphazene as a core and three diisopropylaminocyclopropenimino
substituents, was synthesized,17b and its
pKa in acetonitrile was found to be 42.1.
The CPI-P functionality was also utilized in the computational design
of very strong proton sponges, with a calculated gas phase PA above
323 kcal mol–1 and a pKa in acetonitrile of 48 units,19 which
represents the most basic proton sponge designed so far. However,
similar to other proton sponges, this superbase is kinetically inert;
the calculated activation energy needed for the release of a proton
from the conjugate acid is very high.19

We wondered what alternative aromatic scaffold could be used
in
combination with a CPI and CPI-P motif that would result in a strong
superbasicity and, at the same time, would not suffer from kinetic
inertness that occurs in proton sponges. Azaazulenes are nitrogen-containing
analogs of azulene, an aromatic molecule which is an isomer of naphthalene.
Among azaazulenes, 1-azaazulene is known as a very stable and easily
synthesized compound, with several well-established synthetic paths
for its preparation and preparation of its derivatives.28−31 The experimental data on the basicity of 1-azaazulene are not available,
but the calculated GB of this compound is 231.9 kcal mol–1 (PA = 239.5 kcal mol–1). So far, azaazulenes have
never been used in the design and preparation of organic superbases.

In this work, we present a novel, computationally designed neutral
organic superbases, obtained by utilizing two types of substituents
dimethylaminocyclopropenimines, CPI, and dimethylaminocyclopropeniminophosphazenes,
CPI-P which are combined with 1-azaazulene as a core unit(s). Further,
we have investigated their kinetic basicity by calculation of free
energy barriers for a proton exchange reaction between the neutral
and protonated form of the same superbase.

2 Computational
Methods
All calculations were obtained using the Gaussian09
program package.32 The geometries of all
structures were optimized
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, and the vibrational analysis
was performed to verify the minima or transition states on the potential
energy surface for all structures.

Calculations of PAs in the
gas phase and GBs were carried out at
the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df,2p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The PA
of the molecule B is expressed as a negative change of enthalpy at
298 K for the reaction of protonation 1  

Thus, the PA is calculated according
to the equation 2  

Terms H298(B) and H298(BH+)
are the enthalpies at 298 K of the
neutral (B) and protonated (BH+) base, obtained as a sum
of total energy and thermal correction to the enthalpy calculated
at the level of theory mentioned above, whilst (5/2)RT corresponds to the enthalpy of the proton.

GB represents a
negative change of Gibbs energy for reaction 1, that is, it is a difference
between the sum of the calculated Gibbs energy of the neutral base
and the Gibbs energy of the proton and the calculated Gibbs energy
of the protonated base 3  

The Gibbs energy of the proton in the gas phase, G298(H+), has a value of −6.29
kcal mol–1,33 whereas
the Gibbs energy
of B and BH+, respectively, is obtained as a sum of the
total energy and thermal correction to Gibbs energy calculated at
the aforementioned level of theory.

pKa values in acetonitrile (MeCN) are
estimated using two theoretical approaches. The first one is a procedure
developed by Glasovac et al.,34 which is
based on the correlation between experimental pKa values and calculated basicities 4  

Term ΔGa,sol′(BH+) represents the negative
change of Gibbs energy for the reaction of protonation of a base (eq 1) in acetonitrile. The
Gibbs energy (Ga,sol′) is obtained as a sum of total electronic
energy, the thermal correction to Gibbs energy and the energy of solvation.
The energies of solvation are calculated using the isodensity polarizable
continuum (IPCM) method at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory.

The second approach used in this work for the
estimation of pKa values is based on a
conductor-like polarizable
continuum model of solvation, CPCM.35 We
utilized the thermodynamic cycle presented in Scheme 3, where pyridine with the experimental value
of pKa of 12.5336 served as a reference base Bref.

Utilized for the Calculation of pKa with
the CPCM Approach
The pKa values of the investigated
superbases were given as 5  

The overall Gibbs energy reaction
change in solution ΔrGsol, is calculated as follows 6  where the Gibbs energies in the gas phase
(Gg) represent a sum of total energy calculated
at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df,2p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory and thermal
correction for Gibbs energy. The values of ΔGsol are calculated using the (CPCM)/B3LYP/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d)
model.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 1-Azaazulenes
with Cyclopropenimino and Cyclopropeniminophosphazeno
Substituents
It is expected that the substitution of azaazulenes
with strong electron-donating groups such as cyclopropenimino (CPI)
and cyclopropeniminophosphazeno (CPI-P), would result in an enhanced
basicity of this aromatic compound. Calculations predict that 1-azaazulene
with the gas phase PA of 239.5 kcal mol–1, is more
basic than pyridine, whose PA is 223.8 kcal mol–1 (computed at the same level of theory). Pyridine is an example of
nitrogen-containing aromatic molecule that has been frequently used
as a structural motif for design and preparation of many superbases.4,14,37 We have investigated herein whether
1-azaazulene could also serve as a core unit in the design of novel
superbases.

To investigate the positions of the substituent
on the azaazulene ring that are most favorable for basicity enhancement,
we calculated the PA and GB for 1-azaazulenes substituted with one
CPI group at each of the seven possible positions of the molecule
(Figure 1). Because
the protonation of CPI-monosubstituted azaazulenes (denoted as n-Ac) may occur at the N atom of azaazulene
(Nazaazulene) but also at the imino nitrogen of the CPI
substituent (NCPI), we compared GB and PA values for protonation
at both sites. It should be mentioned that other potential protonation
sites are amino groups of the CPI substituent; however, their PAs
are very low in comparison to the nitrogen of the azaazulene ring
and the imino group of the CPI substituent.

Figure 1 Monosubstituted cyclopropenimino-1-azaazulenes, n-Ac, where n denotes the position
of the substituent on the 1-azaazulene rings (n =
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).

Table 1 contains
the gas phase PAs and GBs for a series of seven monosubstituted cyclopropenimino-1-azaazulenes
(schematically presented in Figure 1), calculated for protonation of Nazaazulene and NCPI, respectively.

7-Ac	264.0	257.3	252.8	246.7	
8-Ac	272.9	265.3	262.1	254.5	
A perusal of the data in Table 1 reveals that all investigated CPI-azaazulenes
possess
PAs greater than 245 kcal mol–1 and therefore, can
be classified as superbases. Molecules 2-Ac and 3-Ac (azaazulenes substituted with the CPI group at positions
2 and 3, respectively) are the weakest bases in the series regardless
of the protonation site, with a PA value of ∼257, and a GB
of ∼250 kcal mol–1. However, in 1-azaazulenes
where the seven-membered ring is substituted at positions 4–8
(n = 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), higher basicity is achieved.
In these five molecules, the preferred site of protonation is always
the azaazulene nitrogen (Nazaazulene) with PA values which
are 11–17 kcal mol–1 higher than those calculated
for protonation of the CPI substituent. The nature of interaction
induced by protonation differs for these two sites. As mentioned earlier,
the protonation at NCPI results in aromatic stabilization
of the three-membered ring (Scheme 2), while the basicity of Nazaazulene in
substituted azaazulenes depends on the electron-donating effect of
the substituents. Further, the protonation of the azaazulene nitrogen
leads to the more efficient π-electron delocalization over the
whole molecule, whereas in the case when nitrogen at the CPI is protonated,
the delocalization is limited to the substituent.38 This assertion is corroborated by the changes of the bond
length between the NCPI and adjacent carbon; in the Nazaazulene protonated systems, this bond length shortens upon
protonation (from ∼1.38 Å in a neutral molecule to ∼1.34
Å, Table S1), while in NCPI protonated systems this bond elongates to the value of 1.43 Å
on average. Moreover, the survey of atomic charges at Nazazulene and NCPI before and after protonation, obtained by Hirshfeld
population analysis,39 shows that reduction
of the negative charge of nitrogen atom upon its protonation is different
for these two sites (Table S2). For molecules n-Ac, (n = 4, 5, 6, 7, and
8) protonated at azaazulene nitrogen, the amount of reduction of negative
charge of Nazaazulene is bigger, compared to the reduction
of negative charge of the NCPI when protonation occurs
at the substituent. The most basic molecule is 8-Ac with
a PA = 272.9 kcal mol–1, followed by 4-Ac and 6-Ac with a PA of 267.0 and 266.8 kcal mol–1, respectively, and 5-Ac and 7-Ac compounds having a PA of 262.4 and 264.0 kcal mol–1, respectively.

Among the molecules protonated at CPI, the
highest PA and GB are
also achieved in 8-Ac. This is due to the additional
stabilizing effect caused by a weak intramolecular hydrogen bond (IHB)
established between the proton on the CPI and the nitrogen atom of
the azaazulene ring (the length of the H-bond is 2.03 Å, Figure 2). Given the positions
of the substituent, this interaction with a nitrogen of the azaazulene
is not possible in other monosubtituted azaazulenes protonated at
the substituent. To assess the strength of this IHB in 8-Ac protonated at the substituent, the AIM analysis40 was performed using the AIMall suite.41 According to the work of Afonin,42 the strength of IHB can roughly be estimated by the calculation
of electron density (ρ) at the bond critical point (BCP) of
the IHB bond, using the following equation that represents improved
Espinosa’s equation42,43 7  

Figure 2 Optimized structure of
the conjugate acid of molecule 8-Ac protonated at the
substituent, with an intramolecular H-bond.

The IHB strength in 8-Ac estimated by the AIM analysis
and eq 7 is 3.3 kcal
mol–1.

The calculated basicity of monosubstituted
azaazulenes shows that
substitution with one CPI group substantially increases the basicity
of azaazulene by pushing electrons toward the nitrogen atom in the
ring, thus making it more susceptible for protonation. Differences
in basicity between azaazulenes substituted at different positions,
although mild, suggest that the electron-donating effect of CPI is
more pronounced when the substituent is placed at positions 4, 6,
and 8, than in the rest of the molecules. Because the inductive effect
of the CPI affects the aromaticity of azaazulene, we explored how
the position of the substituent influences the change of the aromaticity
before and after the protonation, calculating nucleus-independent
chemical shifts, NICS(1),44 for the five-
and seven-membered ring for the neutral and protonated forms of all
monosubstituted 1-azaazulenes n-Ac (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). The results, presented in Table S3, reveal that for all molecules, the
decrease in aromaticity upon protonation is more pronounced in the
five-membered ring. Molecules 5-Ac and 7-Ac show the most noticeable loss of aromaticity, with a ΔNICS(1)
value of 5.6 ppm (from −13.9 to −8.3 and −14.0
to −8.4 ppm going from the neutral to protonated form of the
molecule), whereas for the other studied molecules ΔNICS(1)
is ∼4 ppm or smaller. However, molecules 2-Ac and 3-Ac do not fit into this analysis; despite the mild loss
of aromaticity caused by the proton, their basicity is significantly
smaller when compared with other studied monosubstituted systems.
According to the data from Table S2, the
reduction of the negative charge of the protonation center in 2-Ac and 3-Ac (Δq(Nazaazulen), Table S2) is substantially
smaller than that in the rest of the systems, implying the less efficient
charge delocalization that inversely affects their basicity.

Double and triple substitution of 1-azaazulene with electron-donating
groups should lead to a further increase in basicity. Because the
placement of the electron-donating substituent at position 8 results
in the most basic CPI-substituted 1-azaazulene, followed by substitutions
at positions 6 and 4, we have investigated two superbases containing
two and three CPI groups, respectively, 6,8-disubstituted and 4,6,8-trisubstituted
1-azaazulene, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 1-Azaazulenes substituted with cyclopropenimino (CPI)
and cyclopropeniminophosphazeno
(CPI-P) groups.

The azaazulenes substituted with
the cyclopropenimino group reached
a PA of 290.7 kcal mol–1 (4,6,8-Ac)
and a pKa in acetonitrile of 34.1 units,
according to the CPCM model (Table 2). The change in PA upon substitution by one CPI going
from mono to disubstituted molecule is 9.9 kcal mol–1, whereas the increase in PA going from di to trisubstituted azaazulene
is 8.9 kcal mol–1. This is a very slight difference
in the enhancement of PA, but a certain reduction of basicity increase
(upon addition of one more substituent) is expected because of a well-described
phenomenon of saturation of substituent effects.45 Namely, the capacity of a molecular backbone to accept
electron density brought by a substituent that acts as a strong electron
donor is limited by the size of the backbone; therefore the increase
in basicity is not linearly related to the increase of the number
of electron donor groups.

b For these molecules, it was not
possible to achieve convergence in IPCM calculation.

Another substituent at 1-azaazulene
that we considered is the cyclopropeniminophosphazeno
group (designated here as CPI-P), obtained by a combination of phosphazene
and dimethylaminocyclopropenimine and recently synthesized by Lambert.17b Cyclopropeniminophosphazene is more basic than
dimethylaminocyclopropenimine (CPI), so we anticipated that 1-azaazulenes
substituted with CPI-P could be substantially more basic than CPI-substituted
azaazulenes. The calculated PA, GB, and pKa in acetonitrile of the most basic 1-azaazulenes substituted with
CPI-P, shown in Figure 3, are also presented in Table 2. Because of a convergence problem in the IPCM model for such
types of molecules, pKa values are calculated
using the CPCM solvation model only,35 but
results for superbases with the CPI substituent show that the pKa values obtained by CPCM are in acceptable
agreement with those obtained with IPCM.

The presence of CPI-P
in 1-azaazulene results in extremely strong
superbases; the disubstituted azaazulene has a PA of 313.1 kcal mol–1, while the trisubstituted molecule exhibits even
higher basicity with a PA of 319.2 kcal mol–1 and
a pKa in acetonitrile of 47.5 units. Thus,
for azaazulenes with CPI-P, the overall increase of PA goes from 296.5
kcal mol–1 in the monosubstituted molecule (8-Ap) to 319.2 kcal mol–1 in the trisubstituted
one (4,6,8-Ap). In comparison with CPI-substituted azaazulenes,
the saturation of the substituent effect here is less gradual; the
first increment of PA (from mono to disubstituted) is 16.6 kcal mol–1, while the substitution by the third CPI-P group
enhances the PA for an additional 6.1 kcal mol–1 only. Although substitution of azaazulene with CPI-P results in
very strong superbases, the bulkiness of CPI-P could cause steric
problems when three substituents are present. To estimate a steric
strain caused by the repulsions between the substituents, we compared
the total energy of the three CPI-P groups (without the azaazulene
unit) arranged identically as in optimized geometry of the superbase 4,6,8-Ap, and the total energy of the three molecules of cyclopropeniminophosphazenes
at an infinite distance from each other (i.e., without any mutual
interaction). A prearranged structure containing three CPI-P is by
17.3 kcal mol–1 less stable than three CPI-P groups
at an infinite distance, and this destabilization can be attributed
to the steric strain. Because the saturation of the substituent effect
occurs upon substitution by the third CPI-P, we wondered whether the
presence of the smaller, but less basic functional group CPI as a
third substituent would result in a molecule of similar basicity as 4,6,8-Ap. It turns out that the 1-azaazulene substituted by
two CPI-P groups at positions 4 and 8, and by one CPI group placed
at position 6 (molecule 6c-4,8-Ap, Figure 4), has a PA of 320.2 kcal mol–1, GB of 313.9 kcal mol–1 and pKa in acetonitrile of 45.9, thus being equally basic as 4,6,8-Ap.

3.2 Bis(1-azaazulen-2-yl)-methyl-amines
and Tris(1-azaazulen-2-yl)-amines
with Cyclopropenimino and Cyclopropeniminophosphazeno Substituents
While a high steric strain does not directly influence the basicity
(because the destabilization due to the bulkiness of substituents
is roughly the same in a neutral and protonated molecule), it could
pose difficulty during the synthesis of this type of superbases. To
attenuate this problem, we decided to utilize two and three 1-azaazulene
units in one molecule to act as a core unit in novel azaazulene superbases.
Combining two or three azaazulene units in one molecule enables substitution
with a larger number of electron-donating substituents per molecule,
without further increase in steric strain. The bis(1-azaazulen-2-yl)-methyl-amine
and tris(1-azaazulen-2-yl)-amine (in further text: bis-azaazulenyl
and tris-azaazulenyl, respectively) were employed as a molecular backbone
for superbases that contain two and three 1-azaazulenes, respectively.
New superbases with bis- and tris-azaazulenyl amines are substituted
with CPI and CPI-P, as schematically represented in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Bis(1-azaazulen-2-yl)-methyl-amine
and tris(1-azaazulen-2-yl)-amine
substituted with cyclopropenimino (CPI) and cyclopropenimino phosphazeno
(CPI-P) group.

Calculated values of PAs, GBs,
and pKa values in acetonitrile for bis-
and tris-azaazulenyl derivatives
substituted with CPI and CPIP-P are listed in Table 3. Superbases with two azaazulene units (bis-azaazulenyls)
containing cyclopropenimino group (CPI) do not exhibit a significant
increase in basicity compared to superbases with one 1-azaazulene.
For example, isomers 4-Bc and 6-Bc with
two CPI groups have PAs of 284.9 and 282.3 kcal mol–1, respectively, similar to disubstituted 1-azaazulene 6,8-Ac whose PA is 282.8 kcal mol–1 (Table 2). However, the presence of
two azaazulene units in a molecule makes possible substitution with
four CPI groups (at positions 4 and 6 of each azaazulene) without
steric problems, which results in increased basicity for tetrasubstituted
superbase 4,6-Bc, with a PA of 297 kcal mol–1 and pKa in MeCN of 36.0 units.

Protonation of bis-azaazulenyl
occurs at one of the two present
azaazulenes, each of them carrying its substituent(s). In that arrangement,
the electron-donating group(s) placed at the second, not protonated
azaazulene core, have a smaller influence to the basicity of the system,
compared to substituted 1-azaazulenes (Figure 3) where all the substituents are attached
to the same molecule of azaazulene, and the inductive effect of substituents
is more pronounced. Therefore, the basicity of disubstituted bis-azaazulenyls, 4-Bc and 6-Bc, is expected to be lower than that
in disubstituted 1-azaazulene, 6,8-Ac. However, the reduction
of an inductive effect that adversely affects the basicity of bisazaazulenyls
is compensated by the presence of IHB in the protonated form of molecules 4-Bc and 6-Bc. Although the most stable conformation
of the neutral form of bis-azaazulenyl derivatives corresponds to
the schematic presentation in Figure 5 (where repulsions between lone electron pairs at nitrogen
atoms in the five-membered rings are avoided), the optimal conformer
in the protonated form possesses IHB that occurs after the rotation
of one of the azaazulenes around the C−N(sp3) bond,
as shown in Scheme 4 for molecule 6-Bc.

Scheme 4 Protonation of Bis-Azaazulenyl and
Subsequent Rotation of One Azaazulene
Unit Around the C–N(sp3) Bond, Enabling More Stable
Conformation of the Conjugate Acid
The calculated enthalpy barrier for bond rotation shown in Scheme 4 is low (2.0 kcal
mol–1), implying that it occurs spontaneously at
298 K. The difference in thermodynamic stability between 6-BcH+(a) and 6-BcH+(b) is 7.5 kcal mol–1. The conformer 6-BcH+(b) enables the formation of the intramolecular H-bond between
the hydrogen at N(1) and nitrogen N(1′) of the neighboring
azaazulenyl unit, which stabilizes the protonated form of the superbase
and has a positive effect on its basicity. The length of this IHB
in 6-BcH+(b) is
1.82 Å, and its estimated strength is 6.3 kcal mol–1 (obtained utilizing AIM analysis and eq 7). The presence of IHB represents the main
contribution to the stability difference between (a)
and (b). In the less stable conformer 6-BcH+(a), two hydrogen atoms, one
at the N(1) and the other at the C(3′), are placed at a distance
of 2.17 Å, which is close to the sum of van der Waals radii (2.4
Å), implying that the interaction between them could be attractive.
However, the AIM analysis showed the absence of the BCP between these
two hydrogens. Tetrasubstituted bisazaazulenyl 4,6-BcH+ behaves similarly to 6-BcH+, with a stability difference between conformers (a) and (b) of 7.4 kcal mol–1 and enthalpy barrier for rotation of azaazulene of only 3.3 kcal
mol–1. The length of IHB in 4,6-BcH+(b) is 1.82 Å, and its
strength is estimated to be 6.0 kcal mol–1. In conformer 4,6-BcH+(a), the distance
between hydrogen atoms at N(1) and C(3′) is 2.12 Å, and
AIM analysis did not find a BCP between them.

For CPI-P substituted
bis-azaazulenyls, the most stable protonated
conformers are those with an intramolecular H-bond, analogous to CPI
derivatives. The rotation of azaazulenyl needed for the formation
of this IHB occurs spontaneously in protonated 4-Bp and 6-Bp because calculations predict a negligible enthalpy barrier
(1.8 kcal mol–1 for 6-Bp). However,
contrary to CPI-disubstituted bis-azaazulenyls where the intramolecular
H-bond in a protonated form of the molecule compensates a less efficient
inductive effect of the substituent, disubstituted CPI-P bis-azaazulenyls 4-Bp and 6-Bp (PA = 301.7 and 305.9 kcal mol–1, respectively) have lower basicity compared to analogous
disubstituted 1-azaazulene 6,8-Ap whose PA is 313.1 kcal
mol–1. Besides the less pronounced inductive effect
of the substituent placed at the second azaazulenyl unit, there is
an additional stabilization of the protonated 6,8-Ap—the
intramolecular H-bond between the proton and the nitrogen atom of
the substituent—whose strength is estimated to be 3.9 kcal
mol–1. Therefore, in protonated forms of 4-Bp and 6-Bp, the stabilizing influence of IHB occurring
in the more stable rotamer is not high enough to overcome two stabilizing
effects that are present in protonated 6,8-Ap: the more
efficient inductive effect of two CPI-P placed at the same azaazulene
and intramolecular H-bond between the proton and the nitrogen of the
substituent. Finally, bisazaazulenyl substituted with four CPI-P groups, 4,6-Bp, expectedly has very large basicity, with a PA of over
322 kcal mol–1 and a pKa of 45.7. Again, the rotation of one azaazulene unit is needed so
that a more stable conformer of the protonated superbase is achieved,
and the enthalpy barrier for this rotation is predicted to be only
1.2 kcal mol–1.

The trisazaazulenyl superbase,
a molecule with three CPI groups 6-Tc, whose PA is 293.1
kcal mol–1, is slightly
more basic than the analogous trisubstituted monoazaazulene 4,6,8-Ac (PA = 290.7 kcal mol–1). Superbase 6-Tc in a protonated state possesses one IHB; its calculated
strength is estimated to be 6.6 kcal mol–1. With
a PA of 306.8 kcal mol–1 superbase 4,6-Tc containing six CPI groups (i.e., two substituents per azaazulene
unit) has the highest basicity among CPI-substituted superbases studied
in this work. In cyclopropeniminophosphazeno tris-azaazulenyls, trisubstituted
superbase, 6-Tp, is equally basic as its counterpart
with one azaazulene 4,6,8-Ap, whereas molecule 4,6-Tp containing six CPI-P groups achieves an extremely high
PA of even 335.2 kcal mol–1. Similar to bis-azaazulenyls,
in tris-azaazulenyls the most stable conformation of a neutral molecule
differs from the most stable protonated conformer. We examined rotation
barriers in the conjugate acid, and it turns out that rotation occurs
spontaneously with activation enthalpies of 6.4 and 3.0 kcal mol–1 for 6-Tc and 4,6-Tc, respectively.
For CPI-P substituted tris-azaazulenyls the values of energy barriers
were estimated from a scan, without exact localization of TS on PES,
and their approximate values are 1.0 and 4.0 kcal mol–1 for 6-Tp and 4,6-Tp, respectively.

Bis- and tris-azaazulenyls are systems where double protonation
is possible. Calculation of the second PAs in a gas phase (PA(II))
for bis- and tris-azaazulenyls showed that CPI-substituted systems
studied here have a PA(II) lower than 245.3 kcal mol–1 (superbasicity criterion), except the molecule 4,6-Tc with a value of 249.6 kcal mol–1. For CPI-P substituted
systems, the criterion of superbasicity for the second protonation
is satisfied in molecules 4,6-Bp, 6-Tp,
and 4,6-Tp, and their PA(II) values are 262.3, 262.7,
and 277.3 kcal mol–1, respectively. For tris-azaazulenyls,
even triple protonation may occur. Calculated values of PA(III) for 6-Tp and 4,6-Tp are 213.0 and 247.7 kcal mol–1, respectively.

Finally, to evaluate the kinetic
basicity of some of the novel
superbases presented in this work, we calculated the activation free
energy for the reaction of proton transfer between the protonated
and neutral form of the same superbase. Although new superbases structurally
do not correspond to typical proton sponges, there are several possibilities
for intramolecular H-bonds to be formed upon protonation; therefore,
it is of interest to explore how this feature affects the kinetics
of proton release. For this analysis, we selected CPI-disubstituted
1-azaazulene and CPI-disubstituted bisazaazulenyl (superbases 6,8-Ac and 6-Bc). For the sake of comparison,
the activation free energy for the analogous reaction of the proton
sponge DMAN is also calculated. The activation free energy for the
proton exchange between the protonated and neutral form of DMAN (Scheme 5) is 41.2 kcal mol–1. Such a high barrier indicates that deprotonation
of a conjugate acid is very slow, which is in agreement with the observed
slow kinetics of proton sponges.21

Scheme 5 Proton Exchange between the Conjugate Acid and Neutral Form of DMAN
Contrary to the proton sponge DMAN, the energy
barrier for the
reaction of proton exchange between the protonated and neutral superbase 6,8-Ac is very low, with calculated activation free energy
of 1.2 kcal mol–1. The analogous reaction for molecule 6-Bc also occurs spontaneously, with a calculated free energy
barrier of 1.1 kcal mol–1. Figure 6 shows optimized transition states for proton
exchange between the protonated and neutral form of the same molecule,
for 6,8-Ac, and 6-Bc.

Figure 6 Optimized structures
of the transition state for proton transfer
between protonated to neutral 6,8-disubstituted 1-azaazulene 6,8-Ac (left) and 6,6′-disubstituted bis(1-azaazulen-2-yl)-methyl-amine, 6-Bc (right).

For this reaction, the
transition state that corresponds to transfer
of a proton from the protonated superbase to a neutral one is localized
at PES and connected with both the minima by calculating the intrinsic
reaction coordinate. The frequency of imaginary vibration that corresponds
to the proton transfer between the protonated and neutral molecule
is −1171.8 and −1213.8 cm–1 for 6,8-Ac and 6-Bc, respectively (for comparison,
the frequency of the imaginary mode for proton exchange in DMAN is
−1169.4 cm–1). Such low activation energy
implies that the release of a proton in this type of superbases occurs
very easily.

4 Conclusions
Dimethylcyclopropenimino-
and dimethylcyclopropeniminophosphazeno-based
substituents that act as strong electron donors were employed in the
design of novel superbases using one and combined two or three 1-azaazulenes
as a core unit. The maximum basicity of azaazulene-based compounds
is achieved when substituents are placed at positions 4, 6, and 8
of azaazulene, due to the most favorable distribution of electron
density that makes the nitrogen atom in the azaazulene ring more negative
and thus increases the basicity of the molecule. In molecules based
on one azaazulene unit, substitution with CPI yields superbases with
the calculated PA in a range from 272.9 to 290.7 kcal mol–1 and pKa in MeCN from 28.8 to 34.1 units.
The presence of the same substituent in compounds containing two azaazulenes
as a scaffold resulted in slightly stronger superbases with PA values
from 282.3 to 297 kcal mol–1 and pKa in MeCN from 28.8 to 36, whereas the strongest superbase
with CPI is trisazaazulenyl containing six cyclopropenimino groups
(4,6-Tc) with a PA of almost 307 kcal mol–1. Although the expansion of a core unit that carries electron-donating
groups enables substitution with a larger number of substituents and
therefore leads to an increase in basicity, this dependence is not
linear. This is related to the saturation of the substituent effect,
but it is also a consequence of the fact that the strongest electron-donating
effect originates from substituent(s) placed at the same azaazulene
where protonation occurs, whereas the rest of present groups placed
to the second and third azaazulenyls have a smaller influence on the
system. The important factor that increases the basicity of bis- and
tris-azazulenyl superbases is the IHB between the proton and nitrogen
atom that belongs to the neighboring azaazulene that occurs in the
protonated form of these superbases, regardless of the substituent
type. Substitution with the CPI-P group expectedly resulted in a very
high superbasicity; for molecules with one azaazulene the PA was as
high as 319.2 kcal mol–1 and pKa in MeCN was estimated at 47.5 units. The most basic
bisazaazulenyl with four CPI-P substituents has a PA of 322.8 kcal
mol–1 and pKa in MeCN
of 45.7, whereas the strongest superbase proposed in this work is
tris-azaazulenyl substituted with six cycloropeniminephosphazeno groups, 4,6-Tp, with a PA as high as 335.2 kcal mol–1 and a pKa of 50.

The investigation
of reaction kinetics for the proton transfer
between the neutral and protonated form of the same molecule (dicyclopropenimino-1-azaazulene, 6,8-Ac, and 6,6′-dicyclopropenimino bis(1-azaazulen-2-yl)-methyl-amine, 6-Bc) shows that, unlike in proton sponges, the reaction of
deprotonation has a small activation energy, so their kinetic basicity
is also high—not only the protonation but also a release of
the proton from the protonated base occurs very easily, which makes
them suitable for reactions where fast proton exchange is needed.

Although some of the proposed compounds show remarkable basicity,
their possible application as deprotonating agents in organic syntheses
could be limited by their bulkiness and size. However, unlike the
small superbase, the bulky one would be able to generate the “naked
anion”, which is often needed as an activation step during
organic syntheses.

Given the presence of conjugated π
electrons in azaazulene,
the further theoretical investigation of spectroscopic properties
of the designed molecules is planned to reveal whether the protonation
causes the change of UV/vis spectra, which would lead to the application
of these systems as pH sensors. Because the paths for the synthesis
of 1-azaazulene derivatives are already known,28−31 and having in mind that both
dimethylamino-cyclopropemenimines16 as
well as higher-order cyclopropenimino superbases and cyclopropeniminophosphazenes,17b can be efficiently synthesized, we believe
that new superbases should be recognized as targets for synthesis
and possible application.
