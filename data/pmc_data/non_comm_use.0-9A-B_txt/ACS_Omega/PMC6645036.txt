Two new star-shaped
phenyl- and triazine-core based donor–acceptor (D–A)
type conjugated molecules bearing triphenylamine end-capped arms were
synthesized and characterized as imminent organic optoelectronic materials.
Photophysical properties of the compounds were explored systematically
via spectroscopic and theoretical methods. Because of the presence
of donor–acceptor interactions, these luminogens display multifunctional
properties, for instance, high extinction coefficient, large stokes
shift, and pronounced solvatochromic effect. The compounds also exhibited
phenomenon known as aggregation-induced emission on formation of nano-aggregates
in the tetrahydrofuran–water mixture. The aggregate formation
was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron
microscopy, and dynamic light scattering analyses. Moreover, by controlling
the electron withdrawing ability of the acceptor, complementary emissive
fluorophores (blue and yellow) were achieved. These two complementary
colors together span the entire range of visible spectrum (400–800
nm) and therefore when mixed in a requisite proportion generate white
light in solution phase. These findings have potential for the progress
of new organic white light radiating materials for applications in
lighting and display devices.

Introduction
Over the last several
years, organic conjugated fluorophores have been the subject of active
research1 owing to their bright prospects
in materials science, optoelectronics, and biological fields.2 The rapidly expanding exploration of organic
light emitting materials can be traced back to their easy synthesis,
facile modification, excellent photostability, high emission efficiency
in the visible region, tunable emission color, and low toxicity.3 However, conventional luminescent materials display
high emission in dilute solutions but becomes weakly emissive in the
solid state owing to the strong π–π stacking interaction
which promotes the formation of detrimental nonradiative excimers
and exciplexes.4 To mitigate this aggregation-caused
quenching effect, various approaches have been adopted with only limited
accomplishment.5 In 2001, Tang et al.6 reported a new class of materials known as aggregation-induced
emissive (AIE) materials; wherein, upon aggregation, light emission
was improved rather than being quenched. In 2002, Park et al. reported
aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) materials similar
to AIE materials.7 To decode the unconventional
AIE phenomenon, systematic experimental measurements and theoretical
calculations have been implemented, which led to the conclusion that
restriction of intramolecular motions including rotation, vibration,
stretching, and so forth is the main cause for the AIE effect.8 Taking cue from the aforementioned fact, a series
of new AIE luminogens (AIEgens) have been developed that include siloles,9 cyanostilbenes,10 tetraphenylethenes,11 anthracene derivatives,12 diphenyldibenzofulvenes,13 pyrrole,14 diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives,15 and many others.16−22 The enhanced emission of all the AIEgens in their aggregate and
solid form are also traced to the nonplanar aromatic backbone that
restricts formation of π stacking. However, for most of the
conventional AIE materials, the emission intensity gradually increases
with aggregate formation, but the emission peak maxima do not change
their position. Therefore, the initial emission intensity often remains
in the background affecting the fluorescence enhancement factor calculation.
A better alternative would be to develop a system that changes its
peak position along with emission enhancement upon aggregate formation.
In the literature, several serendipitous reports have appeared where
it is observed that molecules with twisted donor–acceptor (D–A)
systems change emission maxima upon aggregate formation.23 The change in emission peak position is mainly
attributed to the transformation of the molecule from its twisted
intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state in solution to the π–π
stacking state in the aggregates. Upon aggregate formation, the molecular
motion gets restricted, hence TICT get turned off and emission occurs
from aggregates. Triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives have
been extensively applied as the electron donor (D) in opto-electronic
materials,24 and triazine (TRZ) is known as a strong electron acceptor (A) with high symmetry and
AIE activity.25 Again, conjugated star-shaped
donor−π–acceptor (D−π–A) systems
have exhibited some special merits such as broad absorption, large
stokes-shift, easily regulated fluorescence, as well as excellent
nonlinear optical properties.26 By taking
all these factors into consideration, in this work, we synthesized
two conjugated star-burst D−π–A type molecules.
The luminescence behavior of the molecules changed upon aggregate
formation and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) was observed.23 Because of their difference in the extent of
D–A interaction, the two molecules exhibited blue and yellow
photoluminescence in polar solvents.

The blue and yellow are
complementary colors and together they cover the whole range of visible
spectrum. It is reported in the literature that by controlling the
ratio of the molecules with complementary emission, one can successfully
generate white light which covers the whole range of visible spectrum.
The design and advancement of white-light emissive luminescent materials
with tunable emission properties have recently enticed colossal attention
in modern exploration owing to their applications in optoelectronics,
light emitting diodes, optical data storage, photonics, artificial
photosynthesis, as well as solar cell devices, chemosensors, and biosensors.27 Therefore, it is not unexpected that tremendous
research efforts have been invested for developing white-light emitting
materials.28−36 In the literature, several binary and ternary systems27m,37 with complementary photoluminescence have been combined to develop
efficient white light in solution and solid. Apart from physical mixing,
various other principles including fluorescence resonance energy transfer,38 inter- and intramolecular charge transfer,39 excited state intramolecular proton transfer,40 symmetry breaking,41 doping in composite structures,42 photo-induced
electron transfer,43 hydrogen bonding facilitated
J-aggregation,44 mixing of monomer and
excimer fluorescence,45 and so forth have
been used to generate white-light emission. However, these procedures
often suffer from setbacks including cumbersome low yielding synthesis,
uncontrollable energy transfer, temperature sensitivity, and so forth.
Although physical mixing is the most widely used way to develop white
light, several aspects of these methods still require further attention.
The white light generated by physical mixing strictly depends on structural
similarity of the precursor. A preferable homogeneous mixture can
only be achieved when the molecules are almost similar in size and
shape, and they do not display a large difference in their absorption,
quantum yield, photostability, and other physical properties. Also,
a slight variation in their ratio drastically changes the emission
of the combined mixture. Therefore, for practical applications, a
binary/ternary system which can exhibit white light over a varied
range of compositions is of particularly interest.

We herein
report a pair of isostructural fluorophores that display AIE, originated
from their TICT-aggregate dual emission behavior. Besides, by regulating
the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor, complementary emissive
fluorophores (blue and yellow) were achieved. Physical mixing of these
two fluorophores generates white light for a wide range of precursor
ratios.

Results and Discussion
Design Strategy, Synthesis, and Characterization
Two star-shaped D–A conjugated molecules (1 and 2) were prepared by means of the multistep synthesis
as shown in Scheme 1. S1a was synthesized from p-bromoacetophenone
using the p-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst (see Supporting Information). The ethynyl groups were
introduced by Sonogashira coupling of S1a with trimethylsilylacetylene
using [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] and CuI to afford S2a in 84% yield. Subsequent desilylation at room temperature
in a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (2:1), in the presence
of K2CO3, yielded S3a. Finally,
compound 1 was synthesized in 74% yield by Sonogashira
coupling of compound S3a with monobromotriphenylamine
(S4) by using [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] and CuI. Monobromotriphenylamine (S4) was synthesized
following a previously reported procedure.46 Compound 2 was prepared following the similar procedure.
However, S1b was synthesized from 4-bromobenzonitrile
using trifluoro acetic acid.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1 and 2
The compounds 1 and 2 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures S1–S9). The purity of the samples was analyzed by elemental analysis and
melting point determination (see Supporting Information). Finally, from the ESI-MS (Figures S10 and S11) and single crystal X-ray diffraction study (Figure 1a, CCDC 1850927), the formation
of the compounds was confirmed.

along c axis. Color codes: blue (N), dark gray (C),
and light gray (H).

Suitable crystals of
compound 2 were grown by slow evaporation of saturated
solution of the compound in CHCl3. Structural refinements
of 2 revealed that two molecules of 2 are
oriented into a staggered type π–π stacking fashion
in a single unit cell. Moreover, the closest distance between two
molecules in a unit cell is 3.25 Å (C3[1]–N3[2], Figure S12). Crystal structure of 2 shows a planar geometry in the TRZ core having a torsional
angle of 1.34° (N1–C2–C10–C11, Figure S13). The distance between the tri-phenylamine
core to the TRZ core is approximately 12.5 Å (C1–N4, Figure S13). Crystal packing showed that compound 2 has layered packing when viewed along the c axis (Figure 1b).
Important crystallographic data and refinement parameters of 2 are provided in Table S1.

Molecular
Modeling Analysis
The ground-state geometries of 1 and 2 were fully optimized using density functional
theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, as implemented in the Gaussian
09 program package.47Figure 2 illustrates the optimized
structures and the electron density distribution of the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
for compounds 1 and 2. As shown in Figure 2, the 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene
(TPB) part of 1 shows a large deviation
from planarity. The dihedral angle between the central benzene ring
and the substituted phenyl is calculated to be 37.95°. On contrary,
the 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine part of 2 retains
an almost planar geometry. The dihedral angle between the central TRZ ring and the substituted phenyl is 0.07° (≈0°),
which is in close agreement with the X-ray single crystal structure
analysis of 2 with dihedral angle of 1.34°. However,
the TPA at the terminal motifs is twisted away from the
molecular backbone. The HOMO of compound 1 is triply
degenerate and mainly concentrated on electron-rich TPA and spreading up to the bridging alkyne bond (Figure S15). The LUMO is doubly degenerate, but not concentrated
only on the TPB core, rather it extends mostly up to
the bridging acetylenic bond with little involvement of benzene moiety
of TPA end-group as seen in Figures 2 and S15. This
overlapping electron distribution between the two frontier molecular
orbitals is crucial for their optoelectronic device performance. The
HOMO and LUMO energies of 1 are close to −4.92
and −1.43 eV with a calculated band gap of 3.5 eV. Compound 2 exhibits a similar electronic structure for HOMO energy
level. However, the LUMO is largely concentrated on 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine
because of its highly electron-deficient nature. The contribution
of the bridging acetylene bond and the phenyl moiety of TPA in LUMO is much diminished compared to compound 1.
The HOMO of compound 2 is also triply degenerate and
the LUMO is doubly degenerate with energy values close to −4.99
and −2.08 eV, respectively (Figure S16). The calculated band gap is 2.9 eV. The maximum difference between
the HOMO energy levels of the two molecules is 0.07 eV, which indicates
that the HOMO of 2 is unaltered by TRZ.
However, the LUMO (−2.1 eV) is lowered compared to 1 (−1.4 eV) because of the electron-deficient nature of the TRZ unit. This low lying LUMO in compound 2 facilitates
faster and greater extent of charge transfer from donor to acceptor
in the excited state.48 The calculated
frontier orbital energy energies and relative energy band gaps (Eg) are presented in Figure 2 and Table 1. This follows the same trend that was observed from
the UV–vis absorption analysis.

Photophysical Properties
UV–vis spectroscopic
studies of individual compounds (benzene core containing compound 1 and TRZ core containing compound 2) were carried out in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to probe the absorption
pattern. The optical characteristics of compounds 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Both the compounds exhibited dual absorption bands.
The dual band characteristic is quite common in twisted D–A
structures because of partial localization of the conduction band.49 It is clearly observed from Figure 3 that compound 1 has UV absorption bands at 295 nm (ε = 1.380 × 105 mol L–1 cm–1) and 365
nm (ε = 1.836 × 105 mol L–1 cm–1) in THF. Compound 2 also exhibited
two absorption bands at 310 nm (ε = 1.337 × 105 mol L–1 cm–1) and 400 nm (ε
= 1.231 × 105 mol L–1 cm–1). The high energy absorption band can be assigned to the n−π*
transition of TPA moiety, whereas the low energy structured
absorption band could be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer 1ICT transitions from the electron-releasing TPA to the electron-withdrawing cores and 1π–π*
transitions.50 Compound 1 has
a shorter onset of absorption wavelength (λonset =
418 nm) and thus has a larger optical gap (2.97 eV). On contrary,
introduction of an electron deficient TRZ unit in 2 compared to benzene unit in 1 results in the
longer onset of absorption wavelength (λonset = 466
nm) and a smaller optical gap (2.66 eV). Being rigid compared to the TPB moiety, the 1,3,5-triphenyl triazine (TPT) unit gives better planarity to the system 2, thereby
permitting better electron delocalization. This conclusion is further
supported by the DFT calculations.

Figure 3 UV–vis absorption and emission
spectra of 1 and 2 in THF (c = 10–5 M).

Though compound 1 is more nonplanar than compound 2, still it retains electronic communication, which results
an effective D−π–A delocalization leading to effective
energy transfer from donor (TPA) to acceptor (TPB) moiety. Therefore, both the molecules 1 and 2 exhibit single emission peaks at 435 and 545 nm, respectively
(Figure 3). Both the
molecules showed considerable amounts of Stokes-shift of 70 and 145
nm and the quantum yields are 26.01 and 22.20% for compounds 1 and 2, respectively in THF. The photoluminescence
lifetimes measured by the time-correlated single-photon counting technique
reveal that both the compounds have comparable exciton lifetime presumably
due to structural similarity (Tables 1 and S2).

Solvatochromism
The large Stokes-shift observed for compounds 1 and 2 prompted us to further explore the charge transfer interaction
by studying the emission behavior of the substrates in solvents with
varying polarity. The UV–vis spectra of both the compounds
showed that the absorption profiles changed slightly and were practically
free from the effect of solvent polarity (Figures 4a and 5a). On the
other hand, discrete changes in emission color were observed with
alteration of solvent polarity (Figures 4b and 5b). For compound 1 in low polar solvents such as hexane and toluene, the emission
maxima are at around 390 and 410 nm. Nevertheless, with increasing
solvent polarity, the emission maxima gradually shifted to longer
wavelength [475 nm in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)]. The change in emission
maxima is accompanied by decrease in fluorescence intensity, which
can be attributed to pronounced TICT effect in polar solvents. The
observed red-shifted (but weakened) emission intensity of fluorophores
is attributed to the TICT process as the TICT state is vulnerable
to various nonradiative decay processes. TICT is quite a common phenomenon
in systems consisting of donor and acceptor groups linked by a single
bond, where the rotation around that bond leads to decoupling of the
orbitals of these two groups providing the way for almost complete
electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. The highly polar
TICT state is preferentially stabilized with respect to a planar local
excited (LE) state in polar solvent. In nonpolar solvents, the emission
occurs from a locally excited (LE) state; however, when polar solvents
are used emission occurs from TICT giving rise to red-shifted fluorescence.
Because compound 2 consists of a stronger acceptor (A)
unit (TRZ) compared to compound 1, the TICT
effect is more profound in 2 as evidenced from a greater
red shift and highly quenched fluorescence in polar solvents (DMF
and DMSO).

AIE Study
After exploring the origin of absorption and emission
bands in UV–vis and fluorescence spectra, we next investigated
the effect of aggregation on the luminescence behavior of the compounds.
Aggregates were generated by gradually increasing the fraction of
water into the THF solution of the compounds. The formation of aggregates
was further characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
analyses.

The absorption band of 1 did not show
any appreciable change with gradual addition of water in THF up to
40% (Figure 6a). However,
a noticeable diminish in absorption intensity was observed in 60%
water in THF mixture with a red shift of about 20 nm. Furthermore,
a large decrease in molar absorptivity and a maximum red shift of
about 60 nm could be discerned at the water fraction (fw) of 70%. Level-off tails were observed in the visible
spectral region at a water fraction higher than 40%. Such tails are
proposed to originate from the Mie scattering effect when spherical
nano-aggregates are formed in the medium.51

mixture (λex = 370 nm, c = 10–5 M). (c) Photographs of 1 with varying
amounts of water fractions under 365 nm UV light in the THF–water
mixture.

As shown in Figure 6b, luminogen 1 in pure THF (10–5 mol L–1) exhibited an emission
band centered at 435 nm and emitted a blue fluorescence under 365
nm UV light. After adding a poor solvent (water) up to 40%, the emission
intensity is slightly diminished and marginally red-shifted to 450
nm. Now, the electron density distributions of HOMO and LUMO of the
geometry optimized structure of 1 (Figure 2) indicate that there is minimum extent of
charge transfer in its excited state because of poor electron-accepting
power of the TPB ring. Hence, the emission mostly occurs from the
locally excited state (LE). Upon increasing the water fraction to
70%, the aggregate size increases and along with a further bathochromic
shift in the emission spectra. It is well known that dyes upon aggregation
can form π–π stacked structures of the fluorophores,
leading to a reduced band gap with red shift in their emission maxima.23a Thus, it can be speculated that upon aggregation
the compound 1 forms staggered type π–π
stacks and the emission is red-shifted from 436 nm in pure THF to
500 nm in 90% water fraction.

Compound 2 exhibited
two absorption bands at 308 and 400 nm (Figure 7a). Similar to compound 1, for
compound 2 a visible decrease in molar absorptivity with
a red shift of about 20 nm was observed because of aggregate formation,
which is also supported by the appearance of level-off tails. For 2 also, a maximum red shift was observed for water fraction
(fw) of 70%. It shows yellow fluorescence
with a peak maximum centered at 545 nm in dilute THF solution. After
addition of water, emission intensity drastically dropped (from fw 0 to 30%) with a red shift of about 35 nm
(Figure 7b). This reduction
in fluorescence intensity and red shift is attributed to TICT in the
gradually strengthened polar mixed solvent of THF–water. Subsequently,
a striking fluorescence enhancement with a blue-shift of peaks was
recorded. This improved emission and the blue-shifted peak could be
ascribed to the aggregate formation owing to the degraded solvating
power of the aqueous mixture. When larger aggregates are formed at
higher water fraction, the twisting motion of the molecular subunits
is totally restricted; therefore, the TICT process is disrupted. From
crystal structure analysis, it is also evident that due to steric
hindrance the compound can form staggered type π–π
stacks in the aggregate. The final emission comes from the cumulative
excited state along with a blue shift in emission maxima compared
to the TICT emission.52 Unlike the conventional
AIE systems, where the emission intensity only increases, both the
fluorophores upon aggregation display shift in their emission peaks.
For compound 1, the peak undergoes bathochromic shift
due to change from LE state to aggregate with π–π
interacting form, and compound 2 undergoes hypsochromic
transition from TICT to aggregate form. Therefore, both the complexes
exhibit AIE. In our investigation, our deliberate effort to include
donor–acceptor interaction and incorporation of highly twisted TPA rings yielded in generation of different emissive species
including LE, TICT, and π–π stacked aggregated
state, which ultimately manifested in the AIE behavior.

(λex = 405 nm, c = 10–5 M). (c) Photographs of 2 with varying amounts of water
fractions under 365 nm UV light in the THF–water mixture.

Particle Size Analyses
The sudden change in the emission behavior with the change in the
water fraction for both the compounds prompted us to further investigate
the shape, size, and morphology of the aggregates using various techniques
including DLS, SEM, and TEM analyses. For TEM analysis, appropriate
solutions of the complex with different THF–water compositions
were drop-casted on copper grids and slowly dried to afford the final
sample. In mixtures with low water content (50%), both compounds 1 and 2 self-assembled into regular nanospheres
with diameters of 352 and 575 nm. However, when the water fraction
was increased substantially (>70%), the rapid formation of the
aggregate led to the formation of smaller size particles with diameters
of 300 and 150 nm, respectively (Figure 8).

Figure 8 TEM images of aggregates with various THF/H2O fractions. Compound 1 in (a) 50% and (b) 70%
H2O in THF; compound 2 in (c) 50% and (d)
80% H2O in THF.

To further verify our observation, DLS analysis was also
performed on the aggregate with varying solvent fractions (Table S3). It was found that with low water fraction
the formation of particles is gradual; thus, large size particles
with the diameter of 352 nm appear as the main constituent for compound 1 (Figure S20). When the water
fraction was increased to 70%, the average particle size reduced to
300 nm, which clearly supports our observation from TEM analysis.
Compound 2 also exhibited a similar behavior along with
a large decrease in the particle size from 575 nm in 50% water fraction
to 155 nm in 80% water fraction (Figure S21).

Finally, the morphology of the aggregates was obtained from
SEM analysis of aggregated samples deposited on carbon tape after
drying. As observed in Figures 9 and S22, both the compounds showed
spherical morphology in their aggregate forms at the water fraction
of 50%; and when the water percentage was increased, they retained
their spherical morphology, but due to fast aggregate formation their
effective size decreased.

Generation of White Light
Compound 1 mainly
shows blue emission in nonpolar to medium polar solvents including
hexane, toluene, CHCl3, and DCM. Whereas the emission of
compound 2 due to pronounced charge transfer is dominated
by yellow emission. Both the molecules display structural similarity,
similar solubility and fluorescence lifetime. When their normalized
fluorescence intensity is plotted together, it spanned the entire
visible spectrum region from 380 to 720 nm. Hence, it appeared that
if these two complementary fluorophores are mixed in a requisite amount,
it can display white-light emission. DCM was selected as the solvent
for white-light generation because both the molecules were soluble
in any proportions and produce white light in a remarkably wide range
of ratios (Table S4, Figure S27). We initially examined the absorption properties
of the luminogens in DCM solutions (Figures S23 and S24). In DCM, the compounds exhibited two sets of absorption
bands which are almost identical to that in THF. In the initial check,
we found a significant spectral overlap of the absorption spectrum
of 2 with the emission spectrum of 1 in
the solution state (Figure S25). Thus,
there is a strong probability of fluorescence energy transfer cascading
from donor (1) to acceptor (2). Again, the
CIE chromaticity coordinate for 1 appears in blue region A (0.15, 0.11) and the coordinate for 2 appears
in yellow region H (0.42, 0.54) in the CIE diagram (Figure 10d). These results
acclaim that 1 and 2 can be effectively
mixed to effect efficient white-light emission.

proportions excited at 365 nm; (b) emission spectrum of a mixture

for color coordinates of 1 (Point A) and 2 (Point H). The point E indicates white-light coordinates after mixing

concentration was c = 10–5 M in
all the cases.

To evaluate our proposition,
engendering white-light emission by mixing molecular systems with
complementarily emission colors, compounds 1 and 2 were mixed in varied proportions and the subsequent emissions
were recorded. Consequently, a series of solutions was prepared by
varying the relative concentrations of 1 and 2 (Table 2). Upon increasing
the molar ratio of 2 against 1 from 0.0
to 0.9 equivalents, the intensity of higher energy band decreased
gradually, and the intensity of the lower energy band increased progressively
(Figure 10a). White
light was observed within a certain range of ratios of 1 and 2 with the best result obtained when the ratio
of 1 and 2 was 1:4.5 (Figure 10b). On the other side, different
emissive colors were obtained when 1 and 2 were mixed in different other ratios. Interestingly, the compound
which is present in higher quantities dominates the resultant fluorescence
of the mixture of 1 and 2. For example,
when the concentration of 1 is higher than that of 2 the resultant PL is blue color emission, which is the luminescence
color of pure 1. When the concentration of 2 is greater than that of 1, the resultant PL is a yellow
color emission corresponding to 2 (Figure 10c). The emission spectrum
corresponding to point E covered the entire visible region
(400–700 nm) (Figure 10b) with two equal intensity emission maxima at 457 and 550
nm. CIE coordinates were also calculated using luminescence data to
check the purity of the white-light; and this falls in the range of
0.29, 0.33 at λex = 365 nm for the 1:4.5 mixture
of 1 and 2, which was very close to pure
white-light (0.33, 0.33). Previously, most of the reports on generation
of white light by physical mixing of two components suffer from the
fact that a minute change in their molar ratio totally changes their
emission profile.53 This discrepancy mostly
occurs due to uncontrollable energy transfer, formation of inhomogeneous
mixture due to mismatch in size and difference in solubility. In our
investigation, we succeeded in developing two separate fluorophores
which are structurally similar and have comparable solubility, and
because of the difference in their extent of donor–acceptor
interaction, they display complementary emission color. Thus, just
by adjusting their molar ratio, the energy transfer among the fluorophores
is controlled and the white-light emission can be achieved. In our
investigation, we found that the mixture exhibits white light over
a large span of molar ratios of compounds 1 and 2 ranging from (3:17) to (7:13) with CIE coordinates of (0.30,
0.35) to (0.24, 0.29) which are generally acceptable. This upsurges
the reproducibility of the work, where a minor change in the proportion
does not lead to deviation from white-light emission (Table S4, Figure S27).

Thermal Study
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to investigate
the thermal stability of the obtained luminogens. As shown in Figure S27, the TGA analysis revealed that the
onset decomposition temperatures of 1 and 2 under N2 are 405 and 430 °C, respectively. Both
the compounds showed sufficient thermal stability owing to their extensive
conjugated aromatic architectures. The high thermal stability of the
TPA-based luminogens possibly permits them to find extensive applications
for device fabrication.

Conclusions
Two new fluorescent,
star-shaped donor−π–acceptor molecules with electron-accepting
central core bridged by ethyne as π-conjugation arms and TPA
as the peripheral end-capped electron-donating moiety have been synthesized
and their photophysical properties are examined. These luminogens
unveil numerous functional properties. They reveal large molar absorptivity,
exhibit strong emission intensity, and demonstrate perceptible positive
solvatochromic effect. Moreover, these fluorophores are thermally
stable. Spectroscopic studies reveal that the fluorophores show AIE,
which is very prominent for fluorophore 2 from yellow
to red to green. AIE of the luminogens was achieved by progressive
addition of water into their THF solutions. The aggregates formed
were characterized by DLS, TEM, and SEM analyses. On the basis of
on the acceptors, the emission colors can be regulated from blue (1) to yellow (2). By tuning the ratios between
these two compounds almost pure white light was achieved. When these
fluorophores were utilized together in the molar ratio of 1.0:4.5
in DCM, we obtained an intense white-light emission when excited at
365 nm, with CIE values of (0.29, 0.33). As a final remark, such a
white-light emitting solution has prospect for the foundation of new
white-light emitting materials for their potential application in
solution-processed organic electronic devices.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
Reagents used in the present study were obtained
from different standard commercial suppliers. A Bruker make 400 MHz
spectrometer was used to record the NMR spectra, and the chemical
shifts (δ) in the 1H NMR spectra are reported in
ppm relative to TMS as the internal standard (0.0 ppm) or proton resonance
resulting from incomplete deuteration of the solvents CDCl3 (7.26 ppm). 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz,
and the chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm relative CDCl3 at 77.8–77.2 ppm. ESI-MS experiments were performed
in an Agilent 6538 ultra-high-definition Accurate Mass Q-TOF spectrometer.
A Bruker make ALPHA FTIR spectrometer was used for recording IR spectra.
Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were performed using a PerkinElmer
240C elemental analyzer. Analab μ-ThermoCal10 instrument was
used for melting point determination. UV–vis and fluorescence
spectra were recorded with PerkinElmer LAMBDA-750 and HORIBA Jobin
Yvon Fluoromax4 spectrophotometers, respectively. The 1931 Commission
Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates
for the corresponding photoluminescence spectra were calculated by
“GOCIE” software.54 Time-resolved
fluorescence measurements were carried out on Fluorolog 04 using 370
and 395 nm nano-LED source. Quinine sulfate in 0.1 M H2SO4 was used to determine the experimental quantum yields
at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm with Φ = 0.56 for all
assemblies. The quantum yield measurements were done at least triplicate
with values that were within 10% error being averaged. TEM was performed
with a JEOL JEM-2100F instrument operating at 200 kV. DLS measurements
were performed with a Zetasizer instrument ZEN3600 (Malvern, UK) with
a 1738 back scattering angle and He–Ne laser (l = 633 nm). SEM images were obtained using the Zeiss Ultra-55 SEM
instrument with the sample deposited on a silicon vapor. The THF–water
mixtures with various water fractions were prepared by slowly adding
ultrapure water into the THF solution of samples. TGA was performed
in the Mettler Toledo TGA SDTA 851 instrument at a heating rate of
10 °C/min under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Single crystal X-ray
data were collected on a Bruker D8 QUEST diffractometer using the
SMART/SAINT software.

Computational Methodology
Geometry
optimizations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.47 In all calculations, the hybrid B3LYP functional
was used, as implemented in the Gaussian 09 package, mixing the exact
Hartree–Fock-type exchange with Becke’s expression for
the exchange functional55 that was proposed
by Lee, Yang, and Parr for the correlation contribution.56 For all the calculations, the 6-31G basis set
was used. Frequency calculations carried out on the optimized structures
confirmed the absence of any imaginary frequencies.

Quantum Yield
Calculation
For fluorescence quantum yield measurements,
quinine sulfate was chosen as a reference. The quantum yields were
calculated by using eq 1. 1  ΦF and Φ(0.56) are the radiative quantum yields of the
compounds and reference, respectively; A is the absorbance
of the compound; AR is the absorbance
of the reference; I is the area of emission of the
compound; IR is the area of emission of
the reference; and η and ηR are the refractive
indices of the compound and reference solutions, respectively.
