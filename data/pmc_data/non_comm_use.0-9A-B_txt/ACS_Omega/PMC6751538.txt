In
this article, nanostructured amorphous FePO4 (a-FePO4)–carbon nanotube (CNT) composites, with high purity
of FePO4 and a controllable FePO4/C ratio, were
directly synthesized by a fast nanoprecipitation process in a microreactor,
using Fe(NO3)3 and (NH4)3PO4 as precursors. Oxidized CNTs are well dispersed via
strong electrostatic repulsion in a high pH solution system. Subsequently,
a-FePO4 nanoparticles are adhered onto CNTs just following
the fast nanoprecipitation process; then, the precipitated composites
are compacted by ball-milling, forming a compact conductive network
with well dispersed and highly loaded active materials. As cathode
materials for lithium-ion batteries, the composites exhibit a capacity
of 175.8 mAh g–1 at 0.1 C, close to the theoretical
capacity (178 mAh g–1), and a good cycle performance
with a reversible capacity of 137.0 mAh g–1 after
500 cycles at 5 C. Importantly, the enhanced micromixing enables fast
nanoprecipitation in suspension and opens a shortcut for constructing
nanostructured composites that have potential in functionalization
and are easy to handle.

1 Introduction
Rechargeable
batteries supply electrical energy source on demand
for plenty of applications and have become an essential part of our
modern world. Within the last two decades, the ever-growing demands
for more effective batteries raised a strong growth in research focused
on lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology principally. As a main component
of LIBs, cathode materials have significant effects on their electrochemical
performance.1−3 Layered oxide LiCoO2, spinel LiMn2O4, and polyanion-type phosphates4−8 are presently widely implemented in commercial LIBs.9 Among these promising cathode candidates, enormous amount
of research and great expectations are settled on the olivine-type
LiFePO4 because of its abundant resources, high theoretical
capacity, and increased safety.10,11 As an analogue of LiFePO4, amorphous FePO4 (a-FePO4) possesses
extra advantages. The a-FePO4 can be prepared at air atmospheres
and low temperatures, which determines its low cost. Besides, compared
with the two-phase LiFePO4–FePO4 system
like olivine LiFePO4, a-FePO4 is expected to
stabilize a single-phase lithium-intercalation mechanism due to the
notion of a one-dimensional (1D) Li channel being lost, which leads
to a continuous charge/discharge voltage variation and enables the
amount of lithium ions transferred in the charging and discharging
process to be well tracked from the potential. Although FePO4 cathode materials do not have Li ions in the structure, similar
to the lithium predoping process in the lithium-ion capacitors, lithium
predoping could be used to provide preliminary lithium-intercalation
into the FePO4 cathode using an auxiliary lithium metal
electrode before charging of the FePO4/graphite full-cell.
From these viewpoints, a-FePO4 has more advantages compared
with LiFePO4. However, it still suffers from poor ionic
transport and electronic conductivity, causing reduced capacity utilization
at high rates.12−15

Fast transportation of lithium ions and electrons is crucial
to
sustaining rapid charge and discharge processes in the LIBs. Several
practical approaches have been applied to overcome the shortcoming
of some active materials in this aspect, such as decreasing the particle
size,16,17 mixing particles with conductive agents,
and ion doping.14,18 Among them, the most common way
to enhance the conductivity is to coat a carbon layer on the active
particle surface. Unfortunately, the carbon coating method is not
appropriate to improve the electrochemical performance of a-FePO4 because of the phase transformation from the amorphous state
to an electrochemically inert hexagonal system at 460 °C.17 As an alternative method, highly conductive
carbon additives such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or carbon
black are often applied to a-FePO4 materials to improve
the conductivity of the cathodes.19−24

To introduce a-FePO4 into graphene and CNTs, which
have
attracted an extensive area of interest due to high electronic conductivity,
excellent chemical stability, and large surface area,25−29 researchers usually synthesized a-FePO4 in their suspensions.
According to the method of a-FePO4 synthesis, the approaches
to preparing a-FePO4/C composites can be classified into
three categories: hydrothermal method,28,30,31 microemulsion method,12,14,32 and direct precipitation method.18,33−37 Yang et al.31 used the hydrothermal method
to prepare a porous nanowire material composed of a-FePO4 and graphene. This hybrid material exhibited high capacity up to
41.5 mAh g–1 at the discharge rate of 20 C and a
high capacity retention ratio up to 92% over 300 cycles at 0.5 C,
but it suffers from a time-consuming synthesis process, including
a hydrothermal treatment for 12 h and a morphology transformation
period for 24 h. Wang et al.14 fabricated
FePO4/MWCNTs composites with a cylindrical core–shell
structure via a microemulsion method, for which the capacity retention
was around 100% after 200 cycles at 1 C. However, in the microemulsion
system, the FePO4 nucleation process has to be confined
in the nanodroplets with CNTs inside to assure the adhesion of FePO4 and CNTs after particle formation, and an aging process as
long as 3 h was required to fulfill the adhesion. Fan et al.36 used rhodanineacetic acid–pyrene to modify
the graphene, and then both FeSO4 and NH4H2PO4 solutions were added dropwise. The attraction
between Fe2+ and the negatively charged graphene induced
the precipitation of FePO4 particles on the surface of
graphene. However, the purity of a-FePO4 was hard to be
controlled precisely in the reaction system involving multicomponent
coprecipitation processes, and dropwise feeding determined low productivity
as well as difficulties in scale-up. Apart from these main approaches,
other strategies ever reported include atomic-layer deposition,38 mechanochemical synthesis,27 etc. All in all, the synthesis of high-performance a-FePO4-C materials still involves complicated and inefficient processes.
Thus, it is highly desired to develop new strategies of manufacturing
a-FePO4-C materials with the characters of expedition in
process and excellence in product application performance. To this
end, we need to improve the preparation of a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles as well as the combination of a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles and carbon nanomaterials.

Recently, using a membrane dispersion microreactor, our group proposed
a fast and simple approach of preparing a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles that have high purity and narrow size distribution
via fast precipitation.39 By regulating
the addition amount of phosphoric acid, the purity of a-FePO4 could be well guaranteed under different reactant concentrations.40 More recently, we first conducted the surface
modification of a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles
and dispersed them in water and then synthesized the composite composed
of a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles and carbon
nanomaterials by fast suspension mixing and controlled sedimentation
in sequence with the help of a micromixer.41 The reversible discharge capacity reached 119.5 mAh g–1 at 5 C when FePO4/CNT = 80:15, indicating the effectiveness
of their composition. However, it needs to meet two criteria to assure
that this strategy works well. The first is that the monodispersity
of both CNTs and a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles
ought to sustain in a relatively long term. Thus, surface modification
is required for a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles.
The second is that the micromixing of two suspensions ought to be
enhanced as far as possible. Unfortunately, the mixing of two suspensions
is more difficult than that of two fluids obviously. It was noticed
that the preparation of a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles
just relied on the enhanced micromixing of two fluids, and the as-prepared
a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles were well dispersed
in the mixture instantaneously. In addition, learning from using a
T-junction micromixer to synthesize Fe3O4 nanoclusters
with a narrow size distribution from Fe3O4 nanoparticles,42 we recognized the accessibility of controlled
coagulation of nanoparticles in the microreactor. Naturally, we envision
that the FePO4-C nanocomposites might be synthesized via
a one-step coprecipitation method, that is, the solutions containing
iron source, phosphor source, and carbon nanomaterials are continuously
mixed in the microreactor to carry out FePO4 nanoprecipitation
together with the following FePO4-C coagulation. This route
would potentially skip the surface modification of a-FePO4·2H2O nanoparticles and improve the application performance
of FePO4-C nanocomposites substantially.

Accordingly,
in this work, we developed a new facile and fast synthesis
approach of nanostructured a-FePO4-CNT composites via fast
precipitation in a microreactor followed by the ball-milling process.
In detail, the CNT was dispersed in a (NH4)3PO4 solution; after that the obtained suspension was used
as a continuous fluid. The Fe(NO3)3 solution
was selected as the dispersed fluid. They were mixed continuously
to generate the clusters composed of nanosized FePO4 and
CNTs directly. By the utilization of this methodology, the synthesis
process can be achieved within seconds instead of hours (Table S1) due to the extremely small mixing scale
enabled in the microreactor. Meanwhile, it could guarantee the high
purity of FePO4 and adapt the high ratio of FePO4. The electrochemical performance of the composites as cathodes was
further enhanced by mechanical ball-milling, improving the contact
between a-FePO4 and CNT. The factors involved in the preparation
process were thoroughly investigated to understand their influences
on the electrochemical performance of a-FePO4-CNT composites.
The optimizations on procedures and recipes were conducted and further
discussed regarding the dispersion and contact status of a-FePO4 nanoparticles and CNTs. Optimally, the discharge specific
capacities of the cathode reached 175.8 mAh g–1 at
0.1 C and 137.0 mAh g–1 at 5 C and almost did not
exhibit capacity fading over 500 cycles at 5 C, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Proposed Mechanism To Prepare High-Performance
a-FePO4-CNT Composites
We developed the high-performance
a-FePO4-CNT composites with the following features: (1)
the a-FePO4 is composed of nanoparticles; (2) both a-FePO4 nanoparticles and CNTs are well dispersed; and (3) there
exist abundant, uniform, and compact contact sites between a-FePO4 nanoparticles and
CNTs. Accordingly, we proposed a mechanism as shown in Figure 1. In details, CNTs were dispersed
into one of the reactant solutions (containing (NH4)3PO4 or Fe(NO3)3), producing
a high-dispersed CNT suspension via electrostatic repulsion among
charged functional groups (e.g., carboxyl) on the surface of CNTs.
The other reactant solution was introduced into the suspension by
a membrane dispersion microreactor, allowing the fast mixing and reaction
between Fe3+ and HPO42– to
generate a-FePO4 nanoparticles in the mixture. The a-FePO4 nanoparticles were precipitated and then interacted with
surrounding CNTs by electrostatic attraction to generate a-FePO4-CNT aggregates, which were easily separated out as microsized
precipitates. The a-FePO4-CNT aggregates were dried and
then ball-milled to improve the contact between FePO4 nanoparticles
and CNTs.

Figure 1 Schematic of the proposed mechanism for a-FePO4-CNT
composite preparation.

2.2 Dispersion
of CNTs in Reactant Solution
In the stage of making up the
CNTs suspension containing the reactant,
the dispersion state of CNTs is a crucial concern since it determines
the performance of the interconnecting network, which provides fast
electronic conduction pathways between the segregated FePO4 nanoparticles. Nanosized CNTs can offer almost 100% utilization
of the whole carbon network to electron transport among individual
FePO4 particles. However, the utilization will be restricted
if CNTs are agglomerated. Thus, it is necessary to prevent CNTs from
forming huge bundles. In our approach, high dispersion of CNTs was
ensured by chemical functional groups on the surface of CNTs, like
carboxylates, which convey negative charges and, thus, provide the
electrostatic stability that a colloidal dispersion needs. ζ
potential on a surface is the direct indicator of electrostatic interaction.
As seen in Figure 2a, the ζ potential ranges from 21.1 to −28.0 mV for
FePO4 particles, which is dependent on the pH value. Correspondingly,
the ζ potential ranges from 1.8 mV to −73.3 mV for oxidized
CNTs. When the pH is higher than 8, the ζ potential of the CNT
suspension reaches the largest value, and the electrostatic repulsion
among CNTs could increase to the maximum as well. Otherwise, when
the pH decreases to 2, the ζ potential of CNT is almost zero
and the suspension will lose the stability. To investigate the influence
of ζ potential on the dispersion state of CNTs, dynamic light
scattering measurements of suspensions were conducted, and the results
are exhibited in Figure 2b. As seen, it is easily found that the unimodal peak originated
from the CNTs. The CNTs dispersed in the (NH4)3PO4 solution had the size distribution around 142 nm,
and the CNTs dispersed in the Fe(NO3)3 solution
had the size distribution around 712 nm. It indicates that CNTs are
aggregated at a lower pH. For the obtained cathodes, the positive
influence of a better dispersion state of CNTs was to increase the
electric conductivity of the carbon network and decrease the charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) of the cathode, as confirmed
in Figure S2.

solutions.

2.3 Nanoprecipitation
of a-FePO4 and
Aggregation of a-FePO4-CNTs
In the stage of a-FePO4 nanoprecipitation followed by a-FePO4-CNTs aggregation,
the nucleation and growth of FePO4 can take place throughout
the bulk solution once two reactant solutions are mixed. Consequently,
FePO4 particles might generate either close to the CNTs
network, being able to effectively interact with CNTs, or far away
from the network, being prone to agglomerating to larger clusters.
Enhancing the micromixing of two reactant fluids could offset the
difference of CNTs and reactants in the transport property and inhibit
the occurrence of the latter case. Besides, it is obvious that promoting
the nucleation of FePO4 close to CNTs is helpful for building
a more efficient conductive structure, which could be achieved by
increasing the content of CNTs in suspension in our approach. For
a nanoprecipitation process, increasing the concentrations of reactants
usually leads to the decrease of particle size. Thus, our approach
has the potential of providing improved productivity and product performance
simultaneously as long as the good dispersion state of the CNT suspension
and good micromixing performance can be guaranteed.

Figure 3a shows the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of the a-FePO4-CNT composites
under 0.1 M ((NH4)3PO4 and Fe(NO3)3 concentration, FePO4/CNT = 8:1.5)
and pure a-FePO4. Both exhibit no obvious peak, indicating
that FePO4 kept the amorphous structure after adding CNTs.
To further inspect the purity of a-FePO4-CNT composites,
the XRD patterns and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
(ICP-OES) results of composites after 800 °C calcination are
supplied in Figure 3b and Table S2. In comparison with the
diffraction peaks of pure FePO4 indexed from the standard
JCPDS data file no. 29-0715 (green triangle), the XRD patterns of
the composites after calcination show that the crystal structure of
composites was in a hexagonal system with space group P321 (150). In the meantime, diffraction peaks that are relevant to
impurity are not found in the XRD patterns, confirming the excellent
purity of the product. According to the ICP-OES result (Table S2), the P/Fe mole ratio of the composites
was highly close to the stoichiometry of FePO4 (1.00),
implying that the composites contained FePO4 with high
purity. Figure 3c exhibits
the thermogravimetric analysis–differential scanning calorimetry
(TGA–DSC) curve of a-FePO4-CNT composites. Two stages
of mass loss are observed at about 150 and 600 °C, which correspond
to the dehydration process and CNTs oxidation. The whole weight loss
is measured to be about 19.0%. The mass loss of CNTs oxidation is
about 14.7%, which is close to the ratio in feedstock (15 wt %). The
small weight difference may arise from water taken in during weighting.
Herein, we used the content of CNTs added originally to calculate
the specific capacity.

composites; (b) XRD patterns of FePO4 standard (green triangle)
and a-FePO4-CNT composites before and after calcination;
and (c) TGA–DSC curve of a-FePO4-CNT composites.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
of pure a-FePO4, without CNT addition, is displayed in Figure 4a. It exhibits near-spherical
morphology
and an average size of about 20 nm. According to the TEM image (Figure 4b), the surface oxidation
could exfoliate well-dispersed CNTs from their bundles. Figure 4c,d displays different visions
of the as-prepared a-FePO4-CNT nanocomposites under TEM.
Apparently, the a-FePO4 nanoparticles precipitated uniformly
on the CNTs to construct nanocomposites. To further recognize the
structure of the a-FePO4-CNT nanocomposites, the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image is demonstrated in Figure 4e. We can find out that a-FePO4 nanoparticles were in close contact with CNTs, which represents
the same morphology as indicated in the TEM images. To further testify
the existence of CNTs, the elementary analysis of the composites was
carried out by energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and a typical
result is shown in Figure 4f. As seen, the mole ratio of Fe/P is close to 1:1, and the
content of CNT is 15.57 wt %, very close to the TGA result noted previously.
In summary, a-FePO4-CNT composites with close contact between
FePO4 and CNTs as well as uniform particle size distribution
have been successfully prepared by a fast precipitation method. The
contents of FePO4 and CNTs were almost the same as materials
added originally, proving a controllable FePO4/C ratio.

of CNTs; (c–e) TEM and SEM images of a-FePO4-CNT
composites; and (f) EDS of a-FePO4-CNT composites.

As we previously expected, higher CNT concentration
might enable
the fast precipitation to generate more primary FePO4 particles
attached on CNTs and strengthen the contact between FePO4 and CNTs. To prove that, we conducted a series of syntheses of a-FePO4-CNT composites under various reactant concentrations as listed
in Table S3 and then determined the surface
area of samples by measuring the adsorption and desorption isotherms
of a-FePO4-CNT composites. All of the adsorption isotherm
curves shown in Figure 5a display type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, indicating
that both samples were typical mesoporous materials. Calculated from
the N2 adsorption isotherm curves, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of the samples precipitated under 0.025, 0.05,
and 0.1 M ((NH4)3PO4 and Fe(NO3)3 concentration, FePO4/CNT = 8:1.5)
are 89.3, 138.1, and 153.9 m2 g–1, respectively.
In addition, the average size of FePO4 particles was almost
constant under different concentrations (Figure 5b), indicating that the change of surface
area does not result from the variances of particle size. Therefore,
the smaller BET surface area of the sample with higher CNT concentration
was probably due to the tight contact between FePO4 and
CNTs. Furthermore, tight contact also led to higher tap density as
well as less interspace existing in the structure of composites (Figure 5b).

curves and BET surface area of various
samples; (b) particle size and tap density of various samples; (c,
d) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra and cyclic
voltammetry (CV) curves of various samples; and (e) fitting plots
between Zre and ω–1/2 in the low-frequency region of various samples.

The increased contact sites between FePO4 and CNTs explain
the improved electronic conductivity, which could be further investigated
by their EIS measurements. Figure 5c shows the Nyquist curves for all of the cathodes,
which show a straight line at low frequency, and a semicircle ranging
in high and middle frequencies. The straight line and semicircle represent
the diffusion of lithium ions in the electrode and charge transfer
on the cathode surface, respectively. The corresponding equivalent
circuit model is shown in Figure 5c as well.43 As observed
in Table S4, the Rct value of the cathode was much lower than the other two,
revealing a better conductive network for individual FePO4 particles. This result also demonstrates that the electronic conductivity
of the a-FePO4 cathode was significantly improved by increasing
amount of FePO4 particles adhered to CNTs. For lithium
battery cathodes, the ambipolar diffusion can only start at the vicinity
of the point contact between active particles and carbon conductive
agents, which leads to a constrained electric field around this point.
When more contacting points were created, the area for lithiation
reaction increased as well, reflecting a higher apparent lithium diffusion
coefficient, which also can be concluded from the higher and sharper
redox peaks in CV curves. As illustrated in Figure 5d, all CV curves display only one pair of
current peaks located near 3 V, which is in good agreement with the
redox of Fe(III)/Fe(II). The broad redox peaks also prove that the
process of lithiation/delithiation is a continuous, single-phase redox
reaction. For the sample with higher CNT concentration, the redox
peaks were higher and sharper, and the redox interval potential was
smaller, compared with the other two samples, demonstrating the enhanced
lithiation kinetics in the cathode having more FePO4 particles
adhered to CNTs.

Apart from the charge-transfer resistance,
the apparent lithium
diffusion coefficient (D) could also be calculated
with the EIS measurement. The lithium diffusion coefficient was calculated
in Table S5 by using the following equation17 1  Herein, σ is the Warburg factor, C is the lithium-ion concentration in the cathode, F is the Faraday constant, n is the amount
of electrons transferred per molecule redox reaction, A is surface area of the electrode, T is the respective
absolute temperature, and R is the universal gas
constant. As shown in Figure 5e, a distinctly linear relationship between Zre and ω–0.5 is exhibited. These
slopes of lines were used to compare the diffusion coefficients. The
results (Table S6) reveal that the apparent
lithium diffusion coefficient in the 0.1 M sample was 1.6 times of
that of the 0.05 M sample and 3.3 times of that of the 0.025 M sample,
indicating that a significant increment in the diffusion coefficient
could be achieved when more FePO4 particles adhered to
CNTs. Combined with the improved charge-transfer ability, an excellent
electrochemical performance could be expected for the obtained composites.
As seen in Figure S4, the cathode with
0.1 M reactants concentrations exhibits a specific capacity of 127.3
mAh g–1 at 5 C, which was much higher than that
of the cathode with 0.05 M (96.3 mAh g–1) and 0.025
M (81.6 mAh g–1) reactant concentrations at the
same discharge rate.

2.4 Ball-Milling Treatment
of a-FePO4-CNTs
After precipitation, the aggregates
are not compact
enough to form a firm structure. In the macro level, the loose microstructure
affects the volumetric energy density and tap density of the aggregates
adversely. In the micro level, the loose microstructure implies unstable
composite structures. Thus, the final composites with a compact structure
are highly desired for manufacturing high-performance cathodes with
good conductivity and high tap density. In our approach, ball-milling
treatment was conducted for the precipitation aggregates. Since it
did not require pulverization in the ball-milling process, the operation
time could be comparatively short, like 5 h in our work.

Figure 6a illustrates the
comparative EIS results of a-FePO4-CNT cathodes involving
before and after ball-milling. The Rct value of the cathode after ball-milling treatment is 66.0 Ω,
which was far less than that of the cathode without ball-milling treatment
(Table S4). Since these two cathodes were
identical in composition, we could confirm that the application of
ball-milling improves the electron transport performance. Benefiting
from the ball-milling treatment, the aggregates could be compacted
firmly, indicating a comparatively high tap density of 1.05 g cm–3, far larger than that of 0.67 g cm–3 without ball-milling treatment. The rate performance of the cathodes
at various discharge rates (increasing from 0.1 to 5 C gradually and
recovering to 0.1 C) is represented in Figure S5. The cathode after ball-milling treatment displays a specific
capacity of 137.0 mAh g–1 at 5 C, which is larger
than that of the cathode without ball-milling treatment (127.4 mAh
g–1) at the same rate. The result suggests that
the ball-milling treatment significantly improved the utilization
of the cathode active materials.

composites before and
after ball-milling; (b) charge/discharge profiles at current rates
ranging from 0.1 to 5 C of the final composites; and (c) cycling performances
of the final composites at 5 C.

2.5 Comparison of Various a-FePO4-C
Cathodes in Electrochemical Performance
Finally, after taking
the above three stages into consideration, the final composites were
obtained optimally, which present high specific capacity as displayed
in Figure 6b. The charge/discharge
curves of a-FePO4-CNT composites correspond to the discharge
capacities of 175.8, 173.2, 165.8, 155.8, and 137.0 mAh g–1 at rates of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively. For comparison,
pristine a-FePO4 cathodes, mixed with CNTs or carbon blacks
by ball-milling for 5 h, were obtained. As shown in Figure S6, compared to the above results, the marked decrease
in the rate performance indicates a poor dispersion status of the
a-FePO4 and carbon conductive agents and proves that directly
synthesizing a-FePO4-CNTs composites could result in a
better mixing effect than simply ball-milling. The cycling performance
of composites at 5 C was also investigated in Figure 6c. There was no apparent capacity fading
after 500 circles. A detailed contrast of various FePO4/C materials prepared by the in situ synthesis method is shown in Table 1. These above-mentioned
results clearly represent the highest rate performance. Since the
capacity is directly relevant to the conductive materials’
content in the electrode, the carbon content is also compared with
the reported results. As seen, the carbon contents exploited in most
of the literature were much higher than 15 wt % of that in this work.
Generally, combining precipitation and coagulation into one fast step
in the microreactor could assure a good contact status of a-FePO4 nanoparticles and CNTs more flexibly and produce a-FePO4-CNTs cathodes with even higher energy densities.

3 Conclusions
In summary, nanostructured a-FePO4-CNT composites, as
a cathode material for LIBs, were directly synthesized by a fast precipitation
technique in a membrane dispersion microreactor. The prepared alkaline
environment made CNTs distribution uniform, and FePO4 nanoparticles
adhered successfully to CNTs by fast nucleation due to the dense CNTs
network in the suspension. Then, a compact structure of the composites
was formed by ball-milling treatment. It is found that the dispersion
state and concentration of CNTs play crucial roles in the formation
of the good conductive network for a-FePO4 cathodes. With
the help of the CNTs conductive network, the prepared composites show
low charge-transfer resistance and high lithium-ion diffusion ability.
High tap density was obtained through ball-milling as well. Benefited
by the excellent properties of the cathode structure, the as-prepared
a-FePO4-CNT composites performed very well in terms of
specific capacity and capacity retention, which were up to 175.8 mAh
g–1 at 0.1 C and 137.0 mAh g–1 at 5 C, and kept stable at 5 C over 500 cycles without obvious capacity
fading. Furthermore, compared with conventional methods used to synthesize
a-FePO4 in the carbon material suspension, our approach
is flexible to control the ratio of FePO4 to carbon and
ensure the high purity of FePO4 without additional reagent
requirement. Importantly, the enhanced micromixing enables fast nanoprecipitation
in the suspension and opens a shortcut for constructing nanostructured
composites, which have potential in functionalization and are easy
to handle.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
and Materials
Ammonium
phosphate ((NH4)3PO4·3H2O, ≥95%) and ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, ≥98.5%) were obtained from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Nitric acid (HNO3, 65–68%),
sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95–98%), and phosphoric
acid (H3PO4, 85%) were obtained from Beijing
Chemical Works. All of the chemicals were used as received. Carbon
nanotubes (CNTs, FT9101) were obtained from Cnano Technology Co.,
Ltd.

The membrane dispersion microreactor device mainly comprised
two stainless steel sample plates (50 mm × 50 mm × 18 mm)
and a stainless steel microfiltration membrane. The membrane with
a pore size of 5 μm was used in the microreactor as the dispersion
medium. The active area of the microporous membrane was 12.56 mm2, and the geometric size of the microchannel was 15 mm ×
0.5 mm × 0.5 mm (length × width × height).

4.2 Surface Oxidation of CNTs
First,
0.35 g of MWCNTs was added in 100 mL of the mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 (3:1, v/v). After 10 min of sonification
treatment and stirring at 90 °C for 3 h, the suspension was diluted
with water carefully, filtered out, and washed to be neutral with
deionized water.

4.3 Preparation and Application
of a-FePO4-CNT Nanocomposites
As shown in Figure 7, a microreactor
was used to
prepare the a-FePO4-CNT nanocomposites via the precipitation
process. First, the oxidized CNTs were dispersed in 0.1 M (NH4)3PO4 solution by ultrasound treatment
for 20 min to obtain the CNT suspension as the continuous fluid. The
mass ratio of theoretical FePO4 yield to added CNTs was
fixed at 80:15. The dispersed fluid was the aqueous solution containing
0.1 M Fe(NO3)3 and 0.02 M H3PO4. Other conditions with different reactant concentrations
are referred to in Table S3. The flow rates
of both these fluids were set at 50 mL min–1. The
as-prepared nanoparticles in the effluent were filtered, washed by
water, dried, and transferred for ball-milling, in which N-methyl pyrrolidone was added and the nanoparticles were ball-milled
for 5 h. Then, after annealing at 350 °C for 2 h to remove N-methyl
pyrrolidone and crystal water, the a-FePO4-CNT composites
was finally obtained. They were used to construct the cathode. In
detail, they were mixed with poly(vinyl difluoride) (5 wt %) as the
binder, coated on aluminum foils, and vacuum-dried at 120 °C
for 12 h to become the final working electrode.

4.4 Characterization
The particle size
distribution and ζ potential were characterized by a laser scattering
particle analyzer (ZS-90, Malvern). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
were collected on an X-ray powder diffractometer (D8 Advance) using
Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 5° min–1. The Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG) was exploited
to conduct thermogravimetric analysis under an air atmosphere. ICP-OES
spectrometry (IRIS Intrepid II XSP) with a plasma power of 1150 W
and a peristaltic pump rotating at 100 rpm was used to determine elementary
composition of the samples (i.e., iron and phosphorous). A transmission
electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM2010, 120 kV) and a scanning electron
microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM7401, 10 kV) with an energy-dispersive spectrometer
(EDS, HORIBA X-manN) were exploited to observe morphologies
of the a-FePO4 particles, CNTs, and the composites. A Quantachrome
Autosorb-1-C chemisorption/physisorption analyzer was exploited to
measure nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area. To measure
the tap density, we placed the cathode material in a cylinder and
then tapped it at least 50 times by hand. The ratio of the mass and
the volume of the tapped powder was denoted the tap density.

To determine electrochemical performances, we assembled CR2025 coin-type
cells in an argon-filled glovebox with a Celgard 2400 microporous
membrane (polypropylene) as the separator and lithium foil as the
counter electrode. The electrolyte was the mixture of dimethyl carbonate/diethyl
carbonate/ethylene carbonate (1:1:1, v/v/v) containing 1 M LiPF6. Using a LAND CT2001A Battery Analyzer, charge–discharge
measurements were performed in the voltage range of 2.0–4.2
V (vs Li/Li+) at room temperature (25 °C). The mass
of the active material was set as the reference to calculate the capacity.
An electrochemical workstation (VSP, BioLogic) was used to perform
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry
(CV) measurements. For the EIS measurement, the frequency range was
from 106 to 10–2 Hz. For the CV measurement,
the scanning rate was 0.1 mV s–1.
