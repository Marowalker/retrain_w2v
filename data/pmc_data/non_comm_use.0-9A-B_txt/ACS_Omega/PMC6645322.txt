A photoresponsive
microstructured composite is fabricated through
the impregnation of cellulosic filter paper (FP) with a spiropyran-modified
acrylic polymer. The polymer enwraps uniformly each individual cellulose
fiber, increases the thermal stability of cellulose, and ensures the
preservation of the composite functionalities even upon removal of
the surface layers through mechanical scratching. The photochromic
spiropyran moieties of the polymer, even while embedded in the cellulosic
sheet, can reversibly interconvert between the colorless spiropyran
and the pink merocyanine isomeric states upon irradiation with UV
and visible light, respectively. Moreover, the photochromic polymer
presents a faster photochromic response and a higher resistance to
photodegradation, with an outstanding reusability for more than 100
switching cycles when it is incorporated in the cellulose network.
Most importantly, the acidochromism of the modified FP, attributed
to the spiropyran molecules after UV activation, allows the real-time
optical and visual detection of acidity changes and spoilage in food
products, such as wine and milk. Spoilage due to bacterial degradation
and oxidation processes generates acidic vapors that induce the protonation
of the merocyanine. This results in a visually detectable chromic
transition from pink to white of the treated cellulose fibers, corresponding
to a blue shift in the absorption spectrum. The developed photoresponsive
cellulose composite can serve as cost-effective robust optical component
in integrated functional platforms and consumer-friendly indicators
for smart food packaging, as well as portable on demand acidoresponsive interfaces for gas monitoring in industrial and
environmental applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Paper is comprised
of a three-dimensional fibrous network of cellulose,
the most abundant naturally occurring polysaccharide, extracted from
wood pulp through mechanical and chemical processing.1 Structurally, cellulose is a linear homopolymer consisting
of d-glucose units connected by (1 → 4) β linkage,
held together by strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds
between the hydroxyl pendant groups of the glucopyranose rings.2 Owing to their high specific strength and stiffness,
light weight, nontoxicity, abundancy, recyclability, biodegradability,
and low cost, paper-based objects, such as containers, bags, strips,
filters, and cleaning cloths, continue to attract a growing interest
as sustainable alternatives to petroleum derivatives.3 In the last years, a rapid development of cost-effective
paper-based technologies is being registered in the fields of filtering,
printing, packaging, and sensing through the incorporation of functional
molecules and polymers in the cellulose network. In fact, in this
way, additional features and functionalities are introduced to the
paper, such as elasticity, adsorptive, or ion-exchange capability,
resistance to microbiological attack and thermal degradation,4 water and oil repellency,5,6 magnetic
or emitting properties,5,7 electrical conductivity,8 and optical and colorimetric response to pH,
metal ions, volatile amines, and proteins.9−12

Recently, the possibility
to develop sustainable materials with
multiple functionalities that can be activated on demand by means of light stimuli has been explored, by blending polymers
and photochromic spiropyran (SP) molecules. In such systems, the photomodulation
of the material properties arises from the reversible light-triggered
interconversion between two different SP isomers, an apolar colorless
SP and a zwitterionic purple merocyanine (MC), which entails physical
and chemical variations, such as refractive index, dipole moment,
optical absorption and emission, wettability, and chemical recognition.13−15 For instance, our group has exploited SP molecules dispersed within
polymer films, and electrospun fibers and nanofibers of synthetic
and natural polymers to yield mechanically robust platforms with photoswitchable
optical, mechanical, and ion or acid gas-sensing properties.13,16,17 In other studies, SPs have been
embedded in macromolecules from renewable sources, such as polypeptides,
chitosan, and cellulose, through covalent linkage.18,19 As known, a significant advantage of the covalent inclusion of SPs
in a polymer over the simple mixing is the reduction of the SPs aggregation
and, thus, the enhanced physicochemical stability and improved fatigue
resistance.20 However, it was reported
that the direct functionalization of paper with pending SP moieties
by covalent linkage impeded the reversion from the polar MC to the
ring-closed SP isomer because of the dimensional constraints imposed
by the cellulose cavities and by the highly polar cellulosic environment.19 Alternatively, to increase the mobility of the
photochromic units, the incorporation of polymer networks containing
SP moieties through layer-by-layer electrostatic assembly techniques
or the covalent attachment on the cellulose fibers substrate have
been proposed. However, the fabrication of such systems requires time-consuming
multistep functionalization or postprocessing treatments, and the
rate of the SP recovery is significantly affected by the strong electrostatic
or hydrogen bonding interactions between the MC and the cellulose
matrix.20−22

A tremendously important and yet unexplored
application of SPs
incorporated in paper substrates would be in the smart food packaging
area. In fact, the photoactivated acid recognition properties of SPs,
combined with the mechanical and chemical stability, nontoxicity,
and white contrast of paper, could constitute a cost-effective detection
technology that could be directly integrated in the packaging material
to allow a practical monitoring of the food state to the end user,
through wireless detection or naked eye visualization.23,24 In this context, although several types of colorimetric, optical,
electrochemical sensors, radio frequency identification tags, electronic
noses, and biological and enzymatic assays have been proposed,23−27 their use is often impractical for the shelf-life evaluation and
the quality control operations in food processing industries because
of their complex design, long detection times, high costs, chemical
and physical (i.e., temperature, humidity, electromagnetic fields)
interferences, time consuming procedures, and uneasy multivariate
statistical methods or mathematical modeling for data interpretation.25,27 Moreover, to assess the freshness and quality of fish, meat, alcoholic
beverages, and dairy products, much effort has been devoted to the
development of chemoresponsive materials, based on fluorescent dyes,
modified carbon nanotubes and conductive polymers, and of sophisticated
analytical methods (i.e., electrokinetic chromatography, capillary
zone electrophoresis) that can target volatile compounds associated
with microbial decomposition, such as biogenic amines, rather than
acidic byproducts.11,28−30

Herein,
we present a straightforward preparation protocol based
on a noncovalent functionalization of paper strips with SP-modified
poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (SP-PHEMA) upon their immersion in
the corresponding polymer solution. In this way, the amount of SP
adsorbed onto the paper can be controlled by simply changing the dipping
time and the polymer concentration. Moreover, in contrast to the aforementioned
works, the interactions between the SP photopolymer and the cellulose
matrix do not hinder the conformational freedom of the photochromic
moieties, and subsequently, the overall photochromic performance is
enhanced with respect to the SP-PHEMA deposited on glass, in terms
of photoconversion kinetics and resistance to photodegradation, allowing
a high reusability for more than 100 UV–vis switching cycles.
Most importantly, in addition to the material’s attractive
optical properties, we demonstrate its application as photoswitchable
acidochromic sensory probe for food inspection. In particular, through
a case study, we demonstrate for the first time that the acidochromic
properties of SP polymer adsorbed on paper constitute an efficient
and readily available approach to monitor the variations in the acidity
of milk and wine, as they enable the real-time optical and visual
detection of the acidic vapors that are generated in the deterioration
process of these types of food.31 In this
way, it is possible to render paper an ideal acidochromic carrier
for the rapid and effective colorimetric detection of spoilage markers
in smart packaging applications. In light of its optical and chemical
response, the developed composite is suitable for security packaging,
smart in-package food indicators for real-time quality control and
prevention of health hazards, portable acidic vapor sensing platforms
for environmental and industrial monitoring, and several other applications
including rewritable paper or anticounterfeit printing.

Results and Discussion
The SP-PHEMA copolymer was synthesized using standard radical polymerization
procedures.32 The reaction schemes and
chemical characterization are presented in the Supporting Information file (Schemes S1 and S2, Figure S1).
The polymer was then adsorbed on filter paper (FP) by impregnation.
As shown in Figure 1, the surface morphology of the paper samples before and after the
incorporation of SP-PHEMA appeared similar, indicating that the polymer
penetrates within the fibrous cellulose network covering each fiber
uniformly with a thin layer, consistently with previous observations
of cellulose fibers treated with a cyanoacrylate polymer using a similar
approach.5

and (b) FP impregnated
with the photochromic polymer (FP/SP-PHEMA).

To verify the presence of SP-PHEMA onto the FP, chemical
analysis
of FP/SP-PHEMA was carried out through Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy. As it can be observed in Figure 2, the spectrum of the FP/SP-PHEMA presents
the characteristic absorption bands of cellulose, specifically the
stretching modes of the OH groups at 3300 cm–1,
of the C–O at 1030 cm–1 and of the carbon
ring breathing centered and 1161 cm–1,3 which are comparable to those of the untreated
FP, revealing no degradation of the material. Most importantly, the
presence of the carbonyl absorption peak of the polymer at 1728 cm–1 (inset of Figure 2) indicates that the SP-PHEMA was successfully adsorbed
on FP. The other representative bands of the photochromic polymer
at 3400, 1160, and 1074 cm–1, corresponding to the
stretching modes of O–H, C–O and C–O–C,
respectively,33,34 could not be detected in the
FP/SP-PHEMA composite because of the overlap with the strong absorption
peaks of the cellulose in those regions.

polymer (SP-PHEMA) and FP impregnated
with the polymer (FP/SP-PHEMA). Inset: Zoom-in of the 1900–1500
cm–1 spectral region.

The presence of the SP-PHEMA polymer adsorbed on the outermost
fibers surface of FP was also confirmed through X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). As discussed in the Supporting Information, the binding energy variations of the C 1s peak
and its components (Figure S2 and Tables S1 and S2) reveal a possible interaction
via hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of cellulose and
the ester groups of the acrylic polymer, similar to what reported
for composites of cellulose with polyesters.3

To assess the thermal stability of the developed material
and to
evaluate the effect of the interactions between the FP and the SP-PHEMA
polymer on the thermal decomposition profile of the composite, a thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was performed. As shown in Figure 3a, the thermal degradation of the untreated
FP started above 200 °C and the main mass loss was observed in
the 300–400 °C temperature range, as a consequence of
the thermal pyrolysis of the cellulose skeleton.35 For the SP-PHEMA, the highest rate of degradation was observed
above 400 °C, similar to other acrylate polymers.35 Upon incorporation of 1% wt of SP-PHEMA in FP,
the temperatures corresponding to the maximum degradation rates of
FP (T1d) and SP-PHEMA (T2d) extracted from the derivative of the TGA curves (Figure 3b) drastically changed
from 342 to 353 °C and from 439 to 423 °C, respectively,
revealing that the SP polymer impregnation improves the thermal stability
of the paper, in agreement with similar effects observed on cellulose-acrylic
graft copolymers,35 and, at the same time,
that the inter- and intra-molecular interactions between the polymer
chains in the SP-PHEMA become weaker. Both effects could be ascribed
to the formation of H-bonds between cellulose and SP-PHEMA, which,
on the one hand, increases the FP resistance to thermal degradation
and, on the other hand, destabilizes the SP-PHEMA polymer–polymer
interactions. These findings demonstrate that noncovalent embedding
of low contents of acrylic polymers in cellulose significantly improves
the resistance of the latter to thermal decomposition, owing to the
thermally protective polymer layer formed around each cellulose fiber
and, possibly, to stabilizing interactions between the two components.
Interestingly, by substantially increasing the SP-PHEMA concentration
to 17% wt with respect to the FP, the decomposition profile of the
SP-PHEMA component, characterized by the formation of a defined shoulder
at 430 °C, approached the value measured for the T2d of the pure polymer, but only a variation of 3 °C
(356 °C) with respect to the 1% wt FP/SP-PHEMA was registered
in the T1d. This suggests that a concentration
of SP-PHEMA of 1% wt is sufficient to coat and thermally protect the
cellulose fibers, whereas a higher concentration may form a thicker
coating but does not actively contribute to the interactions with
cellulose, leading to a minimal contribution to the further increase
of the thermal stability of FP.

wt of SP-PHEMA polymer. (b) First derivative of the thermogravimetric
curves of the corresponding samples. The degradation temperatures
of FP (T1d) and of SP-PHEMA (T2d) for each sample are indicated in the graph.

The incorporation of the SP-PHEMA
polymer in FP gives rise to important
optical changes upon light irradiation ascribed to the photochromism
of the SP units. As observed in Figure 4a, upon UV irradiation the samples turn from white
to pink. This change occurred in less than 2 min under the irradiation
conditions used in this work. This is due to the photoconversion of
the SP molecules to their isomeric form MC, as demonstrated in Figure 4b by the formation
of an absorption peak centered at 545 nm in the visible region of
the absorption spectrum. The homogeneous color of the sample (Figure 4a) demonstrates that
the impregnation process yields uniformly coated surfaces, rendering
it a practical and fast technique for the functionalization of paper
with photochromic polymers. Moreover, the MC form exhibited a red
fluorescence (Figure 4c) with an emission centered at 620 nm, whereas no signal was registered
for the SP, consistently with other studies on SP-based composites.16,17 The fluorescence imaging allowed to reveal the SP-PHEMA homogeneous
distribution even at the microscale level. In fact, as observed from Figure 4a, the well-defined
fibrous morphology of the cellulose network further indicates that
the fluorescent SP-PHEMA polymer formed a coating layer around each
individual fiber. Upon irradiation of the previously UV-irradiated
sample with visible light, the MC state was reverted to its pristine
SP state in 30 s, and the sample recovered its white color. These
results demonstrate that the paper substrate does not hinder the conformational
flexibility of the SP units attached to the polymer chains, allowing
a reversible interconversion between the two isomers.

confocal images of FP impregnated
with the photochromic polymer (PF/SP-PHEMA) samples before and after
irradiation with UV light (the nonirradiated samples appear identical
to the ones irradiated first with UV light and subsequently with visible
light). (b) Absorption and (c) emission spectra (λex = 560 nm) of FP/SP-PHEMA before and after UV irradiation. SP and
MC refer to the SP and MC forms, respectively.

To further assess the photochromic performance of the developed
material and the effect of the interactions with cellulose on the
efficiency of the photoconversion of SP, the irradiation times needed
for the photoisomerization and the resistance to photodegradation
of SP-PHEMA adsorbed on FP were compared with those of a similar amount
of polymer deposited on a glass slide. As observed in Figure S3a,b, upon UV irradiation under the conditions
used in this work, the maximal photoconversion of SP to MC was reached
after 90 s in the paper composite, and after 150 s in the SP-PHEMA
cast on glass. In a similar way, the SP form was fully restored after
30 s of visible irradiation in the paper composite and after 40 s
in the glass coating. The faster switching rate between SP and MC
measured upon incorporation of the polymer in the cellulose substrate
may arise from a higher mobility and free volume between the SP-PHEMA
polymer chains dispersed in the cellulose substrate, which results
in a more efficient photoisomerization.22 Moreover, the weakening of the inter- and intra-molecular interactions
between the SP-PHEMA polymer chains due to the formation of H-bonds
between cellulose and SP-PHEMA could further contribute to the photoswitchability
of SP because it limits the aggregation of the photochromic moieties.

In addition to the photoinduced recovery process, the spontaneous
reconversion of MC to SP in the FP/SP-PHEMA composite and in the SP-PHEMA
film cast on glass was investigated by storing the samples in the
dark after UV irradiation and the comparison between the two systems
is presented in the Supporting Information file (see Figure S4, Table S3 and relative discussion). In addition
to the faster photoconversion observed in the case of the paper-impregnated
photochromic polymer, a major improvement in its photodegradation
was also registered. As shown in Figure 5a,b, the pure SP-PHEMA polymer coated on
the glass could not undergo more than 50 photoswitching cycles, and
the absorbance peak of MC isomer at 545 nm decreased by ∼20%
after the first 20 cycles (Table S4). Conversely,
after the impregnation in paper, ∼93% of the initial MC optical
signal was retained after the first 20 cycles (Table S4), and although a progressive fall-off was measured,
more than 50% of the intensity was still optically detectable after
110 cycles, whereas the value decreased to 24% after 140 cycles. In
parallel, the chromic change in the sample could be observed by naked
eye up to 70 cycles (Figure S5). The high
resistance to photofatigue can be attributed to the embedding of the
photochromic polymer in the paper substrate and to the polar nature
of cellulose which sensibly reduce the formation of MC aggregates
and the associated photodegradation effects. These findings demonstrate
the robust photochromic response of the composite. To the best of
our knowledge, this is one of the very few studies in which the photochromism
of SP-based systems is demonstrated for more than 100 cycles. Moreover,
such a high reusability in terms of photoswitching cycles has not
been previously documented on SP-functionalized paper substrates.

polymer (SP-PHEMA) on glass upon alternate irradiation with UV and

legend refer to the corresponding cycle number. SP and MC refer to
the spiropyran and merocyanine isomers of the photochromic polymer,
respectively. (b) Absorption at 545 nm of SP-PHEMA on glass upon 60

UV and vis irradiation for 90 and 30 s, respectively. (d) Absorption
at 545 nm of FP/SP-PHEMA upon 150 UV–vis cycles.

The durability of the SP-PHEMA
coating on the FP was assessed by
scratching and subsequently imaging the scratched sample areas through
confocal microscopy after UV irradiation (Figure S6). As demonstrated in the Supporting Information file, the uniform coating of SP-PHEMA around each
cellulose fiber imparts self-similarity. In this way, the material
functionalities are preserved even after the removal of surface layers.

To determine whether the combination of the SP-PHEMA with the FP
would constitute an effective approach to obtain portable indicators
for the optical and visual detection of acidic vapors on demand, the acidochromic properties of the FP/SP-PHEMA composite were investigated
by shining UV light either in the same conditions reported for the
photochromic cycles or for 5 s, using a portable UV lamp, on two samples
used as caps for vials containing liquid HCl and water (Figure 6a). Upon exposure to a neutral
environment, such as water vapors, the UV irradiation promoted the
SP–MC photoisomerization, giving rise to the expected chromic
variation from white to pink in the material (photograph of Figure 6a), as confirmed
by the absorption spectrum of MC in Figure 6a. Conversely, the FP/SP-PHEMA sample in
contact with HCl did not exhibit a significant chromatic difference
after UV irradiation but presented the typical absorption maximum
of the protonated MC species (MCH) centered at 415 nm (Figure 6a).13 This effect is ascribed to the immediate protonation of the formed
MC to its MCH counterpart upon exposure to HCl vapors. The blue shift
in the MC absorbance maximum from to 545 to 415 nm is a result of
the reduction in the electron delocalization that follows after protonation.13 The obtained color (pale yellow) is very similar
to the original white color of the modified FP substrate with SP-PHEMA.
Therefore, the rapid acidochromic response coupled to a distinct photoactivated
colorimetric detection by naked eye of the MC and MCH species demonstrates
the FP/SP-PHEMA sensory functionality. To assess the material potentiality
for the detection of acidic vapors associated to milk and wine
spoilage, FP/SP-PHEMA smart caps were used to seal vials containing
ultrahigh temperature (UHT) and pasteurized milk and three Sangiovese-based
red wines. As they deteriorate, these food samples are known to develop
acidic volatile components, such as acetic acid and lactic acid generated
by bacterial degradation and oxidation processes.36,37 By monitoring the color of the caps every day immediately after
UV irradiation, a progressive transition from pink to white was observable
in time in both milk and red wine samples. Specifically, as shown
in the insets of Figure S7a,b, in the photographs
of Figure 6b,c and
in Video S1, the pink color was no longer
detectable after 5 days in both milk samples and after only 1 day
in all the red wine samples. Furthermore, the spectral analysis confirmed
that the samples cannot be colored due to the protonation of MC to
MCH, similar to what observed upon exposure to HCl vapors (Figure S7a,b). In parallel, the pH and the total
acidity of the food samples were measured for 10 days to investigate
the relation between their chemical modifications and the abovementioned
response of the FP/SP-PHEMA indicator. As shown in Figures 6b and S8a, the pH of the pasteurized and UHT milk samples went from
initial values of 6.70 and 6.75 to 6.60 and 6.62, with a decrease
of 1.50 and 1.90%, respectively, within 5 days. At the same time,
the total acidity, expressed as lactic acid, reached values above
0.16% in both types of milk in 5 days, with a variation of 22% with
respect to their initial values (Figures 6b and S8b). As
previously reported, the pH and acidity of unspoiled milk are approximately
6.70 and 0.14%, respectively, and are mainly associated with citric
acid, phosphates, carbon dioxide, and casein.38 A pH of 6.60 or lower and acidity values above 0.16% on aging are
due to the production of lactic acid by bacterial action.36,38

(FP/SP-PHEMA) samples inserted in hollow screw caps in contact with

irradiation for 90 s (λ = 320–375 nm, power density =
4.15 mW·cm–2) or for 5 s (λ = 365 nm,
power density = 5 mW·cm–2), the pink color
corresponding to the conversion of SP to MC can be visually observed
in the absence of acidic vapors (water vapors), whereas no significant
change is detected in the sample exposed to HCl because of the protonation
of the photogenerated MC to MCH. Inset: Mechanism of the conversion
of SP to MC and subsequent protonation to MCH. (b) Photographs of
UV-irradiated FP/SP-PHEMA samples as caps of a vial containing UHT
milk at day 0 and day 5 and corresponding variation of pH and total
acidity of UHT milk samples as a function of time. (c) Photographs
of UV-irradiated FP/SP-PHEMA samples as caps of a vial containing
table red wine at day 0 and day 1 and corresponding variation of pH
and total acidity of table red wine samples as a function of time.
The chromic change from pink to white is ascribed to the conversion
of MC to MCH, upon exposure to acidic vapors generated during the
spoilage process. The increase in the acidity over time is confirmed
by the increase in the total acidity values and by the decrease of
pH.

Conversely, in the red wine samples,
the most significant changes
in the acidity were detected in the first 2 days. Specifically, the
main decrease (1.0–2.6%) in the pH was measured after one day,
whereas the total acidity, expressed as tartaric acid, increased by
2.5–6.0% after 1 day and reached a plateau at day 2, with an
overall variation of 5–10% depending on the wine (Figures 6c and S9a,b). Such variations with respect to the initial
state were previously attributed to an early stage of wine modification.37 Interestingly, notable differences in the acidity
and pH profiles could be observed among the three wines. In particular,
after 2 days, the table wine T exhibited the highest variation with
respect to the initial values in both pH (∼3%) and acidity
(10%) (Figure 6c),
whereas changes of l.5–1.8% for pH and of 5–8% for acidity
were detected from the analysis of the wines with a certified designation
of origins N and C (Figure S9a,b). The
different changes in the pH and total acidity of the wines might depend
on their alcohol content because their composition is similar (Sangiovese
grape). Specifically, the fastest increase in the acidity and decrease
in the pH were measured in the table wine, which has a lower alcohol
content compared with the other wines. As alcohol is effective in
inhibiting bacterial growth,39 the wines
with a higher alcohol concentration possibly undergo spoilage processes
more slowly with respect to the table wine, consistently with the
obtained results.

Overall, these findings clearly demonstrate
the strong correlation
between the variation of the analytical parameters relative to the
acidity and the color/optical response of the FP/SP-PHEMA composite.
In fact, the chromic variation observed at day 1 and at day 5 in FP/SP-PHEMA
caps on wine and milk samples, respectively, indicates that the FP/SP-PHEMA
system is sensitive to changes of 1.0 and 1.5% in the pH and of 2.5
and 22.0% in the total acidity of wine and dairy products, respectively.
Although in milk such changes are clearly indicative of ongoing alteration
and deterioration processes, further studies are needed to assess
whether the abovementioned modifications in wines registered in the
first 2 days are effectively diagnostic of a compromised state of
the wine due to bacterial or sensory spoilage. However, the results
demonstrate that the FP/SP-PHEMA composite can reveal differences
in the acidity with respect to the pristine values measured immediately
after opening the wine bottles, thus providing information about the
freshness of wine against frauds and counterfeiting. Moreover, as
shown in Figure S10, by plotting the absorbance
ratio of the MCH (415 nm) and MC (545 nm) species as a function of
the total acidity, expressed as lactic and tartaric acid in milk and
wine, respectively, a linear dependence was found (R2 = 0.990) for a concentration range of 0.135–0.175%
for lactic acid and 5.10–5.65 g/L for tartaric acid, indicating
that the optical response of the composite could be used for the quantitative
determination of the acidity upon spoilage.

Another important
feature of indicators is their selectivity toward
the target analytes. Upon testing the composite against vapors of
representative volatile spoilage markers of milk (ethanol, acetaldehyde,
lactic acid, acetic acid)40,41 and wine (acetaldehyde,
acetic acid and ethyl acetate),42 chromic
and spectral changes were observed exclusively in the presence of
vapors of acetic and lactic acid for all selected exposure times ranging
from 60 s to 10 days (Figure S11). These
results clearly demonstrate that the system response is selective
toward acids.

Regarding the reversibility of the response, after
the exposure
to vapors of organic acids and food samples the MC form of the indicator
could not be restored by thermal desorption or light irradiation.
This might be ascribed to a slow desorption of the acid vapors due
to strong interactions with both the polar cellulose substrate and
the MC units of the photochromic polymer. However, such irreversible
response would not hinder the functionality of the developed composite,
as it is intended as a single time use disposable indicator that could
be easily integrated into food packaging materials. Therefore, the
developed material could serve as a low-cost in situ food quality
indicator system, enabling the optical and visual detection of changes
in acidity and, thus, acidic spoilage. Such systems could represent
an alternative to time-consuming sensory analysis based on color,
taste, and flavor carried out by panels of trained experts, a commonly
used technique to assess the quality of wine and dairy products.37 Moreover, they would be especially beneficial
for quality control operations in the food industry and for consumers,
as they would constitute an easily accessible tool integrated in the
package to rapidly verify the food state.

Conclusions
In
summary, we developed a photochromic composite through a straightforward
impregnation method that allowed the incorporation of a functional
polymer with appended SP moieties within an FP microfibrous network.
The homogenous distribution of the SP-PHEMA polymer around each individual
fiber imparted self-similarity properties that preserved the materials’
functionalities upon mechanical scratching and contributed to increase
the thermal stability of FP by 12–14 °C, owing to the
interactions between the SP-PHEMA polymer and cellulose. Most importantly,
a rapid isomerization between the SP and MC forms was registered through
spectral and chromic changes in the material upon UV and vis irradiation
for 90 and 30 s, respectively, with a significant enhancement compared
with the kinetics of photoconversion measured for the SP-PHEMA polymer
deposited on glass, for which 150 and 40 s of UV and vis irradiation
were required, respectively. The faster photochromism, coupled to
an unprecedented reversibility for more than 100 photoswitching cycles,
was attributed to the higher conformational flexibility of the SP
moieties embedded in the SP-PHEMA chains upon dispersion in the cellulose
matrix. In addition, we exploited the photoactivated acidochromism
of SPs to demonstrate the potential utilization of the composite for
smart food packaging applications. By monitoring samples of milk and
red wine for 10 days using FP/SP-PHEMA caps, the changes in the chemical
environment (pH and total acidity), ascribed to the acidic byproducts
of the microbial activity and of deterioration processes, could be
well correlated to the response of the composite films. In particular,
the system was even sensitive to variations in the acidity of wine
that generated changes of just 1% in the pH and of 2.5% in the total
acidity, possibly indicative of spoilage processes. Specifically,
the acidic vapors generated during the samples deterioration could
be detected optically, through the blue shift in the absorption maximum
of the photogenerated MC upon protonation to its MCH counterpart,
and visually by naked eye, through the progressive transition of the
substrates from pink, characteristic of MC, to pale yellow, characteristic
of MCH.

Owing to its outstanding photochromic performance and
the acidochromic
detection in combination with the low-cost and renewability of the
paper substrate, the developed material constitutes ideal smart chips
and caps for smart packaging that would allow the in situ assessment
of the shelf life of food products against counterfeiting and microbial
contaminations in both quality control operations and at the consumer
end. Moreover, it could as well be integrated within various platforms
for environmental monitoring and for a wide range of applications
in textile and printing technologies.

Methods
Materials
Tetrahydrofuran (THF), azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN), 4-dimethylaminopyridine, trimethylamine, Na2CO3, diethyl ether, hexane, MgSO4, methacryloyl chloride,
ethyl acetate (EtOAc), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-dimethyl-6-nitrospiro(2H-1-benzopyran-2,2-indole) (SP), hydroxyethylmethacrylate
(HEMA), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform,
Whatman type-1 cellulose sheets, ethanol, acetaldehyde, lactic acid,
acetic acid (99% v/v), and HCl (37% v/v) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Commercial fat reduced UHT and pasteurized milk and three red wines
made mostly from Sangiovese grape, a table wine (T) [11.5% alcohol
by volume (ABV)], and two wines with a controlled designation of origin,
namely, Chianti DOCG (C) (12% ABV) and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
DOCG (N) (13.5% ABV), were obtained from local supermarkets.

Synthesis
of SP Methacrylate (SPMA)
The reaction scheme
is shown in the Supporting Information file
(Scheme S1). Briefly, 4.5 g (12.8 mmol) of SP were weighted into a
two-necked (150 mL) round-bottom flask and degassed under vacuum for
1 h. After filling with nitrogen gas, 50 mL of CH2Cl2, catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.22 g, 1.8
mmol) at 0 °C, and triethylamine (2.14 mL, 15.3 mmol) were added,
and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 5 min. Then, methacryolyl
chloride (1.50 mL, 15.3 mmol) was added dropwise over a period of
ca. 30 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature
overnight in the dark. It was then subsequently washed with 0.1 M
aqueous HCl, 10% aqueous Na2CO3, water, and
brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered,
and reduced in volume under reduced pressure to yield a brown-orange
solid, which was purified on neutral alumina using hexanes/EtOAc (6:1,
v/v). The purified product was further purified by recrystallization
(CH2Cl2/hexane, freezer) to give fine light
yellow crystals. The reaction yield was 62%.

Synthesis of Poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate-co-spiropyran methacrylate) (SP-PHEMA)
The reaction
scheme
is shown in the Supporting Information file
(Scheme S2). In a Schlenk flask, freshly distilled HEMA (1 g, 7.7
mmol), SPMA (0.323 g, 0.78 mmol), and AIBN (0.1480 mg, 0.0009 mmol)
were dissolved in 25 mL of dry THF under nitrogen atmosphere. The
solution was subjected to three freeze–vacuum–thaw cycles
and subsequently heated in a thermostated oil bath at 65 °C overnight.
After that, the reaction mixture was cooled with liquid nitrogen to
stop the polymerization, diluted with 5 mL of chloroform, and exposed
to air. Solvent and monomer were reduced under vacuum, and the polymerization
mixture was purified by precipitation with 250 mL of dry diethyl ether.
The weight and number average molecular weights of the synthesized
polymer, Mw and Mn, are 19 752 and 14 588 g/mol, respectively.
The polydispersivity index is 1.3539. A shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1), the 1H NMR
(500 MHz, CDCl3, δ in ppm) peaks assigned to the
polymer are: 7.94 (m, 2H), 7.43 (m, 2H), 7.15 (d, 1H), 6.93 (d, 1H),
6.88 (d, 1H), 6.78 (d, 1H), 5.80 (d, 1H), 4.27–3.94 (br, 1H),
3.8–3.72 (d, 2H), 3.44–3.38 (d, 2H), 2.56–2.2
(br, 2H), 1.98–1.82 (br, 2H), 1.72–1.42 (br, 3H), 1.21
(s, 6H), 1.20–1.06 (br, 6H), 1.04–0.96 (br, 3H). The
number of SP functionalities (Mw = 351
g/mol) was determined to be 12 per polymer chain through NMR analysis,
corresponding to a total amount of 29% mol in the polymer.

Preparation
of FP/SP-PHEMA
The FP (2 × 2 cm2 and approximately
400 μm thick) was impregnated through
immersion in a 3% wt and in a 25% wt SP-PHEMA polymer solution in
ethanol for 30 s and dried at room temperature. The amount of polymer
with respect to FP was determined to be 1 and 17% wt, respectively,
through TGA in the conditions reported below. Unless otherwise stated,
the results and discussion refer to FP impregnated with 1% wt of SP-PHEMA.

Characterization
The 1H NMR spectrum of
SP-PHEMA was recorded at 298 K using a Bruker AV-500C spectrometer.
Molecular weights and molecular weight distribution were determined
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using Viscotek GPC/SEC TDAmax
(Malvern, UK). The chromatographic system was equipped with a GPC
column (TSKgel SuperMultipore HZ-H), triple detector array (TDA 305)
consisting of a differential refractive detector, a light scattering
detector and a dual capillary viscometer detector. The GPC chromatography
was carried out using THF as a solvent, calibrated with polystyrene
standard.

The morphology of FP before and after impregnation
with the SP-PHEMA was investigated through an optical microscope (Carl
Zeiss MTB2004).

The chemical analysis of the SP-PHEMA deposited
on a glass slide,
of FP and of the FP/SP-PHEMA composite was performed with a FTIR spectrometer
(Equinox 70 FT-IR, Bruker) coupled to an attenuated total reflectance
(ATR) accessory (MIRacle ATR, PIKE Technologies). Each spectrum was
acquired accumulating 128 scans in the 4000–600 cm–1 spectral range with a scanning resolution of 4 cm–1. In addition, XPS measurements were performed, using a SPECS-Lab
spectrometer with a non-monochromatic Mg Kα source (hν = 1253.6 eV) operated at 15 kV with an emission
current of 10 mA. A charge neutralizer consisting of low-energy (ca.
7 eV) electrons was applied and energy-scale calibration was performed
by setting the C–C/C–H component of C 1s spectrum at
285 eV. Spectra deconvolution was carried out using CasaXPS software.

The thermal decomposition of the samples was investigated by means
of TGA using a TGA (Q500, TA Instruments). Measurements were performed
on 3–5 mg of samples in an aluminum pan under inert N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 50 mL/min, at a temperature range
from 30 to 600 °C and at a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1. The weight loss and its first derivative were recorded
simultaneously as a function of time/temperature.

Absorption
spectra of the SP-PHEMA deposited on glass and of FP/SP-PHEMA
were collected through a UV–visible–NIR spectrophotometer
(Cary 6000i-Varian) in transmission mode, fixing each sample on a
sample holder with a 1 × 1 cm aperture and using untreated FP
and glass slides as references for the baseline correction. The recovery
of the samples after UV irradiation was determined through spectral
scans in the 300–700 nm region every 10 min for 60 min. Emission
spectra and confocal images of the FP/SP-PHEMA composite were acquired
through a confocal microscope system (A1, Nikon, Japan). Excitation
at 560 nm with an energy density of 2.6 × 10–4 mJ·μm–2 on a spot area of 0.12 μm2 was performed using the continuous laser unit integrated
within the microscope set-up and the emission signal in the 580–680
nm range was collected by a 4-PMT 32-channels spectral detector with
a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels and a bi-directional scanning
speed of 1 fps operated by a Galvano scanner.

To evaluate the
scratch resistance of the FP/SP-PHEMA, linear scratches
were performed on a micro-combi tester (Anton Paar Gmbh, Germany)
equipped with a diamond Rockwell indenter tip of 100 μm radius.
The combinations of different scratch loads (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 N) and
scratch events (1, 5, and 10) were evaluated at a constant tip speed
of 2 mm·min–1 and scanning length of 2 mm.
All of the scratch tests were carried out at laboratory conditions
(T = 21 ± 1 °C, 50 ± 5% RH). After
the test, the samples were imaged through confocal microscopy using
the same parameters described above. Z-Stacks of
a 200 μm optically thick section were acquired to determine
the optical depth in each frame and to reconstruct each 3D scratch
profile.

Irradiation of the Samples
UV irradiation was carried
out for 0–180 s using a bromograph chamber (MF 1030/C, Nuova
Delta Elettronica s.n.c., Italy), equipped with four 15 W UV neon
tubes emitting at λ = 320–375 nm with a power density
of 4.15 mW·cm–2. Visible irradiation was conducted
for 0–40 s by means of a white light source with a power density
of 3 mW·cm–2. UV–vis irradiation cycles
on the samples were performed as reported above selecting the following
irradiation times: 90 s UV and 30 s vis for the FP/SP-PHEMA composite
and 150 s UV and 40 s vis for SP-PHEMA deposited on a glass slide.
Alternatively, in Video S1 and in the food
spoilage detection experiments, to allow the real time visual color
change of the samples in contact with acid vapors, UV irradiation
was performed either as reported for the UV–vis irradiation
or for 5 s using a portable UV lamp emitting at λ = 365 nm and
with a power density of 5 mW·cm–2.

Detection of
Acid Vapors
FP/SP-PHEMA samples were inserted
in hollow screw caps to seal several vials that contain HCl, water,
ethanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, acetic, or lactic acid. The
samples were kept in the dark at room temperature for different times
ranging from 60 s to 10 days and were then UV irradiated for 90 s
(λ = 320–375 nm, power density = 4.15 mW·cm–2) to determine the color and optical changes of the
material upon exposure to the vapors of each compound.

Detection of
Food Acidic Spoilage
FP/SP-PHEMA samples
(0.050 g, 3.4 × 10–8 moles of polymer, 9.9
× 10–9 moles of SP units) were inserted in
hollow screw caps to seal vials containing 15 mL of UHT and pasteurized
milk and 15 mL of three types of red wine samples, T, N and C, and
were stored at room temperature in the dark for 10 days. The samples
were irradiated every day as reported for the detection of acidic
vapors or, alternatively, for 5 s (λ = 365 nm, power density
= 5 mW·cm–2) to subsequently visually monitor
the color and the spectral changes. In parallel, the pH and the total
acidity of another set of samples, stored in the same conditions reported
above, were measured daily for 10 days. Specifically, the pH was determined
through a pH meter (Edge, Hanna Instruments), and the total acidity
was determined by potentiometric titration with 0.1 M NaOH. Briefly,
milk samples (15 mL) were kept under magnetic stirring and NaOH was
added dropwise until the pH reached the endpoint of 8.4. In the case
of wine, the titration endpoint was reached at pH 7 and, prior to
the measurements, each sample (10 mL) was degassed to eliminate CO2 and mixed with 10 mL of boiled distilled water. The pH and
total acidity of milk and wine samples were measured, respectively,
as described in the standard ISO 6091:201043 and in the OIV-MA-AS313-15 and OIV-MA-AS313-01 standard procedures
defined by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV).44 In particular, according to these reference
methods described in refs (43) and (44), the acidity of milk is expressed as lactic acid and the acidity
of wine as tartaric acid. All of the tests were conducted in triplicate
to ensure the data reproducibility.
