Fabrication of partially biobased
poly(trimethylene terephthalate)
(PTT) elastomeric blends was done via melt processing. Both natural
rubber (NR) and epoxidized NR (ENR) were investigated as impact modifiers
at 40 wt % loading to avoid lowering the overall biobased content
of the blend system below that of the PTT alone (35% renewable content),
along with maleated polybutadiene rubber (MR) and dicumyl peroxide
(DCP) as reactive compatibilizers. The compatibility of the blend
components was investigated using contact angle, rheometry, and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). The interfacial tensions and work of adhesions
indicated that ENR was more miscible than NR in the PTT blend system,
which was corroborated by the higher shear viscosity of the ENR blends
and strong shear thinning behavior. Additionally, the predictive modeling
of viscosity ratios on the elastomer–thermoplastic morphology
was found to match the SEM micrographs with the dispersed elastomeric
phase within the PTT matrix. The SEM images of the blends also establish
that both the compatibilizers reduced the rubber inclusions size,
though DCP hampered the impact performance as compared to the MR.
In the presence of the MR, there was an increased cross-linking and
observed variation in the Fourier transform infrared peaks demonstrating
chemical interactions between the maleic anhydride groups with the
PTT that allowed for the impact strength to reach 137 J·m–1 or 4.5 times that of the neat PTT, with the modulus
of toughness increased by 82% and an elongation at yield of 50% because
of the flexibility and amorphous nature of the rubber constituent.

Introduction
As sustainable plastics
are now becoming more sought-after, there
has been a growing shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewably
sourced polymers. These biobased plastics are starting to show technical
and economic benefits over their fossil fuel counterparts.1 One such polymer is that of partially biobased
poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), a semicrystalline aromatic
polyester, with its utilization increasing over the past decade as
it provides benefits in biocontent and performance tradeoffs. It has
mechanical properties close to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
and processing criteria near poly(butylene terephthalate), making
it competitive in the thermoplastic market.2 PTT is known for its tensile strength, elastic recovery, surface
properties, chemical and abrasion resistance, dimensional stability,
and crystallization rate.3 However, this
material is inherently brittle and acts as a major drawback, restricting
its application potential as an engineering plastic. To overcome this
weakness, a major focus has been the implementation of elastomeric
inclusions into thermoplastics such as PTT to provide rubber-toughened
plastics that attain greater impact strength.4 This is a result of blending becoming a simple and economic route
for the performance enhancement of polymeric systems to attain superior
physical and mechanical properties. To date, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene,2 ethylene-propylene-diene monomer rubber,5,6 poly(ethylene-octene) elastomer,7,8 poly(styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene),9,10 and polybutadiene11 and their maleic anhydride grafted counterparts
have been tested for their effective toughening of PTT. Unfortunately,
most of them are synthetic elastomers that lower the overall biobased
content of the blend system. Therefore, natural rubber (NR) being
a completely biobased toughening agent is a more environmentally conscious
alternative, which has yet to be explored, to the best of the authors’
knowledge, though there still remains the issue of phase separation
and immiscibility between such polymeric components when blending
thermoplastics with rubbers that affect the final macroscopic properties,
requiring further compatibilization.12,13 Not only are
the individual polymers responsible for the performance of these types
of blends, the final morphology also plays a significant role, with
the distribution, size, and shape of the dispersed phase being affected
during melt processing. Therefore, the use of compatibilizers to influence
the intrinsic parameters such as interfacial adhesion, while monitoring
the effect the extrinsic parameters such as strain rate and temperature
have on them, are important characteristics when toughening rubber-modified
ductile matrices.14

This investigation
was aimed at augmenting the toughness and impact
performance of PTT through inclusion of bioderived elastomeric material,
following a similar setup scene in the previous work.15 By incorporation of NR and its epoxidized alternative along
with maleated polybutadiene and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as compatibilizers
in a melt-blending process, a rubber-toughened PTT was obtained. The
resultant rheological, mechanical, and morphological characteristics
were studied.

Results and Discussion
Contact Angle Analysis
The resulting static contact
angles for the thermoplastic PTT and both elastomeric rubbers were
obtained with distilled water (polar) and diiodomethane (nonpolar),
as listed in Table 1. From the measured values, the PTT had the lowest contact angle
of the polymers tested for both liquids. The angle being below 90°
in the case of water for PTT demonstrates that there is a small hydrophilic
characteristic to the material based on wettability classification
for smooth solid surfaces.16 This affinity
is less so for the epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), where the angle
is close to 90°. For the NR, it is above the 90° threshold,
making it hydrophobic with little wetting occurring on the surface,
though in the case of all three materials, the contact angles were
comparatively high for the polar liquid (70° and above) relative
to the nonpolar liquid (below 60°). This shows that the polymers
tend to have a greater nonpolar characteristic to them that causes
increased wettability and lower contact angle in the case of the nonpolar
diiodomethane and vice versa for the polar water. This is represented
by the large dispersive component of the polymers all above 25 mN·m–1, whereas the polar components are less than 10 mN·m–1 with the highest associated with the thermoplastic.

To further differentiate between
the polymers, the polarity which
is defined as the quotient of the polar component to the total surface
tension of the polymer,17 can be used to
show that the ENR has a polarity between the PTT and NR. This correlates
well with the transition observed for hydrophobic NR to hydrophilic
ENR, which relates to the presence of epoxide, providing increased
polarity regions for greater hydrogen bonding to occur. Another factor
that can be obtained from the contact angle is the work of cohesion
which is twice the total surface tension and emphasizes the work per
unit area required to separate the interface between a solid or liquid
to establish two surfaces.18 The NR had
the lowest work of cohesion followed by ENR and then PTT; these intermolecular
forces, therefore, also increased in the same manner, with PTT having
the greatest attractive forces present.

To elucidate how the
polymers will interact in the blend system,
the interfacial tensions and work of adhesion for the binary blends
were determined, as shown in Table 2. It was recognized that the PTT/ENR interfacial tension
is small in contrast to the PTT/NR. This difference can be associated
to the polarity of the polymers, with closer polarities of PTT and
ENR having lower interfacial tension. On top of this, the solubility
parameters can help explain this gap in interfacial tension as the
PTT has a solubility of 21.4 MPa1/2,19 which has more similarity to the solubility parameter of
ENR 18.2 MPa1/2 over NR 16.9 MPa1/2,20 further demonstrating the enhanced compatibility
between PTT/ENR over PTT/NR. Likewise, when inspecting the work of
adhesion values that describe the blend component interactions, the
PTT/ENR is larger than the PTT/NR by over 10 mN·m–1. The low interfacial tension and high work of adhesion for the PTT/ENR
blend will therefore have greater mixing and less separation under
processing conditions, as it is known that strong polymeric interactions
occur for large work of adhesion and low interfacial tension values,
retaining more stability in the blend system.21 These observations show that there is more compatibility between
PTT and ENR to help improve the blend performance. This was also supported
by the decrease of the PTT glass transition temperature, Tg, with a shift toward the Tg of the ENR, emphasizing some miscibility and interactions between
components, which were not present for the PTT/NR blend, as shown
in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

Rheology
Two additional parameters that can give more
insight into the dispersion characteristics of immiscible blends can
be obtained by the critical capillary number (Cacrit) and the minimum sphere radius of the dispersed phase
(Rα). The critical capillary number
relates to the interface where the dispersed phase breaks up into
smaller sizes because of instability of viscous and shear forces from
the continuous phase overcoming the restoring forces linked to the
interfacial tension.22 The equation for
the calculation of these values was developed by Wu23 for the case of non-Newtonian melt-blended polymeric systems
and relates to the capillary master curve. 1  where ηd and ηm are the viscosities of the dispersed and matrix phases in
Pa·s, respectively, γ̇ is the shear rate in s–1, and σ is the interfacial tension between dispersed
and matrix phases in N·m–1. The exponent in
the equation is positive when ηd/ηm > 1 and negative when ηd/ηm <
1. These immiscible combinations will contain a minimum dispersed
size based on eq 1. It
is seen from Table 2 that both the PTT/NR and PTT/ENR have a similar critical capillary
number, yet the lower value entails less shear force requirements
to cause disperse phase breakup in the PTT/NR blend, although this
same blend has over five times the minimum sphere radius associated
with it relative to the PTT/ENR. This large differentiation is not
likely to be evident, however, because of the processing equipment
providing elongational flow during twin-screw compounding above that
of just simple shear flow,24 which results
in a more nonspherical elongated dispersed phase structure.

To further the analysis of the phase morphology of the blends, the
critical factor known as the melt viscosity ratio can be used. This
ratio is found from the polymer melt viscosities under mixing conditions.25 To avoid behavioral variation in the rheological
characteristics of the blend system from the interaction effects,
each polymer underwent rheology testing separately under comparable
conditions to those in the final compounding process. The resultant
data are represented in Figure 1 for the viscosities of the individual polymers across the
frequency range. For all the elastomers, there is a linear relation
in terms of the reduction in the complex viscosity as the frequency
is increased, which is common in the case of polymeric materials,
which show shear thinning or pseudoplastic behavior.26 The PTT melt had the lowest complex viscosity and displayed
near-Newtonian flow behavior, unlike the three elastomers, making
it flow easily throughout the shear range. Next, both the NR and ENR
show comparable viscosities with a slight increase at low frequencies
for the epoxidized rubber, as it has more polarity and requires greater
forces to break any intermolecular polar interactions. Similarly,
the maleated rubber will have polar anhydride groups present that
cause the large viscosity for this polymer.27

Figure 1 Viscosity
of the neat polymers with respect to the frequency and
their apparent shear viscosities at the processing condition shear
rate.

Figure 1 also shows
the calculated shear rate of 40.6 s–1 for the final
melt mixing stage before injection molding and the corresponding viscosity
values for the various polymers. These were used to calculate the
viscosity ratios for the 60/40 wt % thermoplastic–elastomeric
blends. To determine the type of morphology likely to occur, the ratios
were then placed onto the compositional phase inversion diagrams,
depicted in Figure 2, that have been modeled based on the viscosities of the blend components
and their volume fractions by several authors including Metelkin–Blekht,28 Miles–Zurek,29 Utracki,30 and Steinmann.31 There are three morphologies that can be obtained,
the outcomes being either the thermoplastic as the matrix and elastomer
as the dispersed phase, or the reverse scenario and lastly the case
of co-continuous morphology. The shaded region in Figure 2 relates to the area in which
a co-continuous structure primarily exists and acts as the inversion
boundary, often associated with good compatibilization of the constituents.
Outside of this zone are the areas in which the thermoplastic forms
the matrix with the elastomer as the dispersed phase, and upon transitioning
through the intermediate co-continuous regime, the thermoplastic becomes
the dispersed phase and the elastomer acts as the matrix. For the
case of the PTT/NR and PTT/ENR blends, both their viscosity ratios
are found in the upper right quadrant with volume fractions of 0.51
and 0.52, respectively. This demonstrates that the blends are expected
to have a thermoplastic matrix with an elastomeric dispersed phase.
Similarly, the PTT/maleated polybutadiene rubber (MR) viscosity ratio
was calculated to be 55.6, meaning that it will also maintain the
same morphology. As the viscosity ratio becomes further from the edge
of the phase inversion, there is greater distinction between the matrix
and dispersed components.32 Therefore,
it is expected that PTT/ENR has a more discernible phase differentiation
over the PTT/NR. This morphology of the thermoplastic matrix with
a dispersed elastomer should be more pronounced for the PTT/ENR/MR
ternary blend as the viscosity ratio will be elevated between 3.9
and 55.6.

Figure 2 Theoretical phase morphology of PTT blends based on the viscosity
ratio and volume fraction.

Next, when analyzing the samples containing DCP, the blend
undergoes
dynamic vulcanization while under shear force causing additional variation
in the morphology. As the elastomer is cross-linked from the curing
agent, agglomerates substantially heighten the viscosity of the blend,
which in turn augment the elongational and shear stresses.33 The high viscosity then causes breakup of the
rubber phase into small particles at a critical stress, preventing
coalescence.34 The outcome is a finer dispersion
of the elastomer in the thermoplastic matrix also known as the sea-island
morphology.

To provide additional information on the compatibilization
of the
blends and how they relate to the observed mechanical and morphological
properties, their rheological behavior was investigated. Therefore,
the complex viscosities as a function of the angular frequency for
all the blend samples are presented in Figure 3. For the PTT, there is minimal shear thinning
because of its rigid structure compared to the elastomers in the blend
systems.2 All blend systems exhibit greater
viscosities than the neat PTT for the low frequency range that is
related to the high viscosities of the elastomers themselves and the
ability to restrict PTT flow in the molten state.35 The viscosity of the blends increased in the order of NR,
to ENR, to ENR with MR, which is the same trend of the elastomers
alone. The increased viscosities for the ENR blends relative to the
NR blend is the greater degree of grafting that occurs from the epoxy
groups causing branched chains which leads to greater shear thinning.36 When examining the samples with DCP, the corresponding
blend viscosities increased. This increase can be related to additional
adhesion and cross-linking between the phases.35 However, this was not as effective with the MR present,
as it already promotes further chemical and physical interactions
between the thermoplastic and the elastomer without the need of DCP.

Figure 3 Dependence
of viscosity on the frequency of PTT and its blends.

Furthermore, the storage (G′)
and loss
(G″) moduli were measured and used to provide
tan δ (=G″/G′)
for the various blends, as shown in Figure 4. The storage modulus (not shown) demonstrated
a weak frequency dependence with the blend systems having a greater G′ and smaller terminal slope as opposed to the neat
PTT, while the loss modulus (not shown) showed a greater influence
with the shear rate, with PTT having a larger slope over the blends
at high shear rates, establishing the considerable rheological contribution
from the elastomeric dispersed phase. On the basis of the tan δ
curves, all samples containing ENR had a value below 1, indicating
a gel-like behavior.37 This gel characteristic
may be explained by the cross-linking occurring from the epoxide groups
present.38 As a result, a reduction in
the PTT chain mobility is observed, causing this increase in the storage
modulus versus the loss modulus, which is also documented by the cross-link
density of these blends, as noted in Table 3. The maleated polybutadiene causes a larger
cross-link density of the ENR phase, while the DCP may interact more
readily with the thermoplastic PTT for free-radical initiation and
subsequent cross-linking, as no substantial variation in ENR cross-link
density is observed when DCP is present in the binary system and a
small influence for the ternary blend.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
FTIR
was performed to evaluate how the ENR and MR influence the observed
mechanical and morphological changes and to identify chemical reactions
that may be taking place in the blends. All blends and the corresponding
constituents of PTT, NR, ENR, and MR are all shown in Figure 5 within the range of 1900–800
cm–1. To determine whether there was an interaction
occurring with the ENR incorporated into the PTT and subsequent blends,
the absence or presence of peaks between the corresponding blends
can act as a guide for the type of interactions occurring. For the
epoxy group, the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations associated with
the epoxy ring are located at 1250 and 875 cm–1,
respectively.39,40 These peaks were observed for
the ENR spectra alone, but they were not apparent in the PTT/ENR blends.
The disappearance of both these peaks may be a sign of a reaction
going on between the ENR and PTT via epoxy ring opening, though the
peak found at 1250 cm–1 may be hidden by the wide
peak at 1260–1230 cm–1, related to the stretching
vibration of the C–O bonds from the PTT ester linkage. Along
with this, there is a slight shift in the 1710 cm–1 peak corresponding to the carbonyl group (C=O) stretching
vibration to a higher wavenumber by 5 cm–1 as seen
by the dashed line in Figure 5, which is additional confirmation that the ENR chemically
interacts with the PTT.41 On the basis
of these observations, there is a rationale that the epoxide group
undergoes ring opening during processing and reacts with the hydroxyl
groups along the side chain or at the terminal polymer chain ends.
Similarly, the MR has representative peaks at 1860 and 1780 cm–1 that coincide with the anhydride carbonyl symmetrical
and asymmetrical stretch vibrations.42 These
peaks also vanish upon blending with the PTT/ENR, demonstrating that
a reaction between the maleic anhydride groups and the PTT blend has
likely occurred. Another indication of this is the reduction in intensity
seen at the 1715 cm–1 peaks mentioned earlier for
the two samples containing MR. Possible reactions are depicted in Scheme 1. On the basis of
these interactions, there is a linked compatibility and toughness
observed for the ENR and MR blends. These reactions lead to greater
affinity between the thermoplastic and the elastomer to provide greater
dispersion of the rubber throughout the matrix, as is evidenced by
later findings in morphology and mechanical performance.

Mechanical Properties
The tensile test results for
the PTT samples are given in Table 4. Both the tensile strength and tensile modulus show
a reduction when the elastomeric component is present. This is a decrease
of 58% or more for the tensile strength of the PTT blends and a 51%
or greater loss in tensile modulus. The rubber phase in these samples
are soft and less rigid than the PTT, which reflects the diminished
tensile properties as seen with other rubber-toughened PTT blends.5 However, there is the advantage of elongation
at yield for the ENR blends, as the elongation is larger than the
neat PTT. Here, the elasticity of the ENR provides flexibility, allowing
for larger strains before tensile integrity loss. When the MR was
added alongside the ENR, there was a 17 times greater elongation at
yield over the PTT. This same sample also expressed superior tensile
toughness, determined from the area under the stress–strain
curve, with an increase of 82% compared to PTT, revealing that there
may be greater compatibility and intermolecular interactions occurring
between polymers to avoid the early onset of mechanical failure. As
for the DCP-containing samples, the performance showed no variation
over the PTT/ENR sample and caused a decline in the elongation and
toughness of the PTT/ENR/MR ternary blend, though strength and stiffness
were raised slightly. This may again lead to the notion that the DCP
aids in the cross-linking of the ternary system as seen with the cross-link
densities mentioned earlier, which restricts the molecular chain movement
and stiffens and strengthens the sample.

Another key aspect
to the inclusion of the elastomeric component
is seen from the impact toughness results illustrated in Figure 6. The low Izod impact
strength of PTT demonstrates the notch sensitivity of the thermoplastic,
which may be suppressed by rubber modification. The impact behavior
of all room-temperature samples showed the flat fracture surface having
complete breaks. There was only microscopically sized stress-whitened
zones for these samples as observed with other researchers working
with rubber-toughened PET.43 As for the
PTT/NR sample, the incompatibility and large interfacial tension present
between the polymeric components lead to minimal improvement and the
largest dispersed particles, as represented in Table 5. As the NR is switched to ENR, the epoxide
cross-linking and greater interfacial interactions result in reduced
particle diameters and a greater circularity. These changes provided
further augmentation of the impact strength for the PTT/ENR sample,
which was surpassed when the MR was implemented. For the PTT/ENR/MR
ternary blend, the highest impact strength was observed to have a
4.5 times greater performance or a 357% increase over PTT. This improvement
is related to the heightened cross-link density compared to the binary
system and the dispersed particles reaching the submicron level (<1
μm). The ductility of this sample based on the tensile properties
also correlates well with the impact properties.

and hardness of PTT and its elastomeric
blends (note: no value presented for the PTT/NR hardness, as it was
below the scale limit).

PTT/ENR/MR + DCP	0.83 ± (0.55)	0.73 ± (0.25)	
Next, when the DCP was added to the
ENR blends, the polymer chains
are restrained further with radical-initiated cross-linking, reducing
the flexibility and deformation mechanism of the blend. These samples
became stiff with a network of compatibilizer chains which impedes
the cavitation and renders the toughening of the elastomeric dispersed
phase less effective.44 The hardness of
the ternary blend with DCP emphasizes this rigid behavior, as it had
the largest Rockwell R scale value, 82 HRR, of all
the rubber-toughened PTT blends. Yet, this was not enough to match
the 115 HRR value associated with the PTT because of the soft elastomeric
phase.

Morphological Analysis
Delving into the cryo-fractured
morphology of the PTT blends, distinct differences may be seen in Figure 7. The PTT provides
a definitive brittle fracture with a smooth surface topography. Second,
the binary blend of PTT/NR has a slightly uneven surface that shows
the onset of a small degree of toughening and large dispersed inclusions,
as mentioned in Table 5. When shifting to the ENR blends without MR, there is a similarity
in the morphology. Both samples shown in Figure 7c,e have a unique structure with a large
haphazard surface typically associated with increased ductility, yet
there remains a wide distribution of elongated dispersed elastomeric
domains present. However, once MR was incorporated into PTT with or
without DCP, there was a clear distinction in the resultant topography.
These samples from Figure 7d,f have a pronounced sea-island morphology with a rough uneven
surface. The coarse appearance links well with the impact strength
being the greatest for the PTT/ENR/MR blend. It can also be recognized
that the interparticle spacing between adjacent dispersed elastomeric
regions is larger in the case of the sample containing DCP. Even though
the ternary blend with DCP has a thorough dispersion with less variability
in particle size, the impact strength of the DCP sample was lower
as the rubber is unable to stabilize the crack growth during sudden
impacts within the PTT matrix. Expanding upon this, there already
exists evidence that strongly correlates the reduction in the interparticle
distance (thickness of the matrix ligament between adjacent elastomeric
particles) to the improvement in the impact strength of a rubber-toughened
polymeric blend.45 Therefore, the combination
of a submicron dispersed phase and low interparticle spacing together
provided sufficient conditions for an improvement in the toughness
of PTT, as seen with the PTT/ENR/MR sample.

Conclusions
In this work, a systematic analysis of
the miscibility, rheological,
mechanical, and morphological properties of binary and ternary rubber-toughened
PTT blends prepared via melt compounding was performed. This study
focused on enhancing the performance of the rubber within the PTT
and differentiating between the PTT–elastomeric blends rather
than specifically comparing to PTT alone. On the basis of the contact
angle results, the ENR showed better miscibility characteristics toward
PTT having a low interfacial tension and greater work of adhesion
compared to NR. This enhanced compatibility was further established
with the maleated rubber that provided greater cross-linking, resulting
in augmented viscosities of the ternary blend system, which supported
toughening. Along with this, there was a reduction in the particle
size of the dispersed elastomer phase. Of these samples, the PTT/ENR/MR
blend had an impact strength improvement of 357% over neat PTT, with
a 17 times greater elongation at yield, and only a 65% loss in tensile
strength. Upon the introduction of peroxide as a means of vulcanization,
the mechanical properties were hindered and exhibited a less ductile
and greater separation between rubber inclusions that decreased the
reinforcing capabilities of the elastomeric phase. The mechanical
performance of these rubber-toughened blends is therefore a balance
of compatibility and cross-linking that affect the overall morphology
to allow for the observed rise in impact strength. In future communications,
inclusion of biofibers and biobased reinforcing fillers into the blend
will be adapted to retain the tensile strength and modulus of these
blends.

60, was used from HB Chemical. The ENR with an epoxidation level of
50% (ENR), known as Epoxyprene 50, was received from Muang Mai Guthrie
(Thailand). A maleinized polybutadiene rubber (MR) with a tradename
Ricobond 1731 was supplied by Chemroy Canada Inc. The chemical DCP
99%, a free-radical initiator, was purchased from Fisher Scientific.

Specimen
Preparation
The polymer PTT was initially
dried in an industrial oven at 80 °C for approximately 4 h before
being processed to establish a moisture content below 0.5%. All other
materials were kept under indoor ambient conditions (22 °C and
50% relative humidity) until processing commenced. The PTT was first
placed in the HAAKE PolyLab QC modular torque rheometer at 250 °C
with a screw speed of 100 rpm for 2 min to premelt the thermoplastic.
After this allotted time, the incorporation of any NR or ENR material
within the mixture was done and left for 1 min before the final addition
of maleinized polybutadiene and/or DCP into the blend system. This
was mixed for an additional 2 min until the torque of the machine
had leveled off. All samples including the neat PTT were blended in
the machine for 5 min before being removed and immediately cut into
small <4 cm2 samples for further processing. To create
test samples with the material, the samples were then processed in
a 15 cm3 corotating twin-screw Xplore MC 15 microcompounder
(Netherlands). The same temperature and speeds, 250 °C and 100
rpm, respectively, were used for the extrusion with a retention time
of 1 min. The extrudate was then injection-molded using a 12 cm3 microinjection molding machine Xplore IM 12 with a mold temperature
of 30 °C. The resulting mechanical samples were then used for
performance evaluation.

Characterization
Throughout the
analysis of the studied
samples, the use of neat PTT was considered the control for comparing
the remainder of the samples. The thermoplastic PTT was then kept
constant at 60 wt % of the blend systems, with the elastomeric portion
contributing the additional 40 wt % of the blended samples. Refer
to Table 6 for a complete
breakdown of the various sample constituents.

Rheometry
The rheology of the samples, along with NR,
ENR, and maleated rubber, were conducted using an Anton Paar modular
compact rheometer (MCR 302) equipped with a convection temperature
device (CTD 450). The measurements were performed with a gap separation
of 1 mm between a parallel-plate geometry (diameter of 25 mm) under
a nitrogen atmosphere with the temperature set at 245 °C to prevent
degradation during testing. A dynamic frequency sweep was run from
low to high frequency with a frequency range of 0.1–100 Hz
and a shear strain fixed at 0.1%.

The shear rate (γ̇)
can be calculated from the following equation24 2  where d is the diameter of
the barrel in mm, v is the screw speed in rpm, and g is the channel depth or gap between the screw and the
barrel in mm. In the case of these experiments, all samples underwent
a screw speed of 100 rpm and had a maximum barrel diameter of 15.5
mm and a gap of 2.0 mm during the DSM microcompounding. Therefore,
the shear rate was calculated to be 40.6 s–1 during
processing.

Contact Angle Evaluation
Contact
angle analysis was
conducted, as the surface tension also plays a key role in the rheological
behavior as it relates to the capillary thinning and breakup extensional
characteristics of the blend system.46 The
measurements were obtained from the contact angle equipment ramé-hart
standard goniometer (260-U1) for neat PTT, NR, and ENR. The tests
were conducted under ambient conditions with the polar liquid being
deionized water (γp = 51.0 mN·m–1 and γd = 21.8 mN·m–1) and
the nonpolar liquid being diiodomethane (γp = 0.4
mN·m–1 and γd = 50.4 mN·m–1).47 The droplet interface
between the liquid and the surface was captured with the DROPimage
software (ver. 2.8.05), which then calculated the contact angles via
the circle method following the static sessile drop technique. An
average and standard deviation for each sample was determined based
on three reiterations.

To determine the surface tensions (γ)
of the individual polymers, the model known as Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble48−50 was used, which involves the combination of polar (γp) and dispersive (γd) components. 3  where θ represents the contact
angle
in radians, and the solid and liquid surface tensions for the polar
and dispersive components are differentiated by the superscripts and
subscripts, respectively. The total surface tension was then calculated
via the sum of the two individual components.

The surface tension
values obtained were first extrapolated to
processing temperature conditions using the following equation51 4  where
γ is the surface tension at either
the room temperature during contact angle testing (Tr = 20 °C) or the processing temperature (Tp = 250 °C). The converted surface tensions
were then examined for interfacial tension by the geometric mean equation52 5  where i and j subscripts
distinguish between two individual polymers. The work
of adhesion for the binary blend systems was calculated from the Dupré
equation53 6  

Cross-Link Density of the
ENR Phase
The swelling test
was used to provide the cross-link density of the ENR for the blends
containing the ENR. It has been previously established that the cross-link
density can be obtained from the volume fraction of the rubber phase
when swollen in the sample gel.54 The samples
were prepared in triplicate with a size of 1 cm2 and a
thickness of approximately 3 mm. The samples were predried in an oven
at 105 °C for 4 h before being weighed. The samples were then
immersed in toluene at room temperature for a period of 18 h (overnight)
to reach swelling equilibrium. Following this, the swollen samples
were removed from toluene, and excess solvent on the exterior of samples
was removed via absorbent wipes. To minimize toluene evaporation from
within the samples, they were immediately weighed. From this, the
cross-link density was calculated according to the following equation:41 7  where α
is the weight content of the
ENR in the sample, ρr and ρs represent
the resin ENR (0.97 g·cm–3) and solvent toluene
(0.865 g·cm–3) densities, respectively, and mi and mf refer to
the mass of the samples before and after swelling, repectively.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra
of the PTT samples and individual polymers were acquired using an
attenuated total reflectance IR stage with Nicolet 6700 FTIR (Thermo
Scientific). For each sample, 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm–1 was conducted under ambient conditions in the % transmittance
mode. The samples used were the injection-molded samples, while the
NR, ENR, and MR were all used as received from the manufacturers.

Mechanical Testing
An Instron 3382 Universal testing
machine was used to determine the mechanical properties of PTT and
its blends. Following ASTM D638, the tensile properties were measured
with type IV specimens under ambient conditions with a 5 mm·min–1 test rate. Bluehill software was used to analyze
all the results obtained from tensile experiments.

For the impact
strengths, a TMI Monitor Impact tester was used to test samples 40
h after they were notched with a motorized notching cutter. The values
were obtained in compliance with ASTM D256 method A using a 5 ft·lb
pendulum in the notched Izod impact setup. A minimum of five samples
for each specimen was measured for calculation of averages and standard
deviations.

Hardness testing was performed on the various samples
at room temperature
using the Wilson Rockwell hardness tester model 2001R. This was in
conformation with ASTM D785 Rockwell hardness R scale
using a minor load of 10 kg and a major load of 60 kg with a 12.7
mm diameter steel ball indenter tested in the normal direction of
the sample.

Microscopy Imaging
To establish
the morphological characteristics
of the blend systems, a Phenom ProX (Phenom-World BV) scanning electron
microscope was used to collect micron scale images. To provide an
adequate representation of the interior structure of the samples,
they were first cryo-fractured by immersion in liquid nitrogen for
30 s. The samples containing the elastomer were then immersed in acetone
for 1 h to etch away the rubber phase for imaging purposes. Prior
to analyzing the samples, a Cressington 108 sputter coater was used
to coat the samples with gold to prevent charging. This was followed
by SEM imaging, with parameters set at 2000× magnification and
5 kV accelerating voltage.

ImageJ 1.46r software was then used
to measure the size and shape of the minor elastomeric regions from
the acquired SEM images. The parameters used for the identification
of the elastomeric voids were an area of ≥0.1 μm2, circularity from 0 to 1, inclusion of holes, and exclusion
of edges for a minimum of 1200 particle counts.
