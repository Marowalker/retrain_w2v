Incorporation of flavylium-derived
chalcones in the cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide-templated synthesis of mesoporous silica particles with no
subsequent removal of the micellar phase leads to high luminescence
(0.3 < ϕf < 0.5) and strong color-contrast
photochromic pigments finely tunable over a large pH range (1 <
pH < 11).

Introduction
The pH-driven chemical
reaction network of flavylium compounds
exhibits a diverse and rich photochemical variety, especially due
to the appearance of photochromic systems.1 The photochromic effect arises mainly when trans-chalcone (Ct) molecules are irradiated, which produces cis-chalcone (Cc) species. Afterward, a cascade
of reactions may lead to colored flavylium cations, as depicted in Scheme 1 in the case of 7-(N,N-diethylamino)-4′-hydroxyflavylium.2 All of this occurs in aqueous solutions, and
it was already explored with detail in microheterogeneous systems,
such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles,3 ionic liquids,4 and
pluronic gels,5 for this particular compound.
The fluorescence of the chalcone species, however, is rather elusive.
Twisted intramolecular charge transfer-like processes occur in the
excited states,1,6,7 which
compete along with trans–cis photoisomerization, and therefore
chalcone species are generally nonluminescent.

Scheme 1 One of the challenges
is indeed to immobilize these photochromic
systems as pigments, abandoning solution-based photochromism, which
hinders some potential applications typical of photochromic compounds. Incorporation
in zeolites was already attempted, but no photochromic effects were
observed as the flavylium cation was stabilized.8 Meanwhile, mesoporous silica materials have gained increasing
attention in materials science because of their unique properties,
such as, controlled pore structure, high pore volume, high surface
area, and uniform pore size distribution,9 as well as the potential applications in catalysis,10 adsorption,11 sensing,12 optoelectronics,13 electrochromic devices,14 and in drug
delivery.15 A study on mesoporous silica
was recently carried out, wherein some photochromic effect was observed.
The chalcone was chemically grafted inside the pores of calcined silica,
giving rise to photochemical reactions.16

The covalently bonded chalcones in the MCM-41 particles bring
the
advantage of avoiding lixiviation of the samples when immersed in
aqueous solutions, but until now the photochromic effect has shown
rather low optical contrasts. Usually, these MCM-41 materials are
used without the surfactant, which is eliminated by calcination or
by solvent extraction. A new approach was therefore designed; the
flavylium chalcone was incorporated in the micellar phase during the
synthesis of MCM-41 by an easy single-step method, avoiding the surfactant
removal. This method of inclusion has been much less explored, but
previous work demonstrated that these surfactant–silica hybrid
materials possess promising optical, sensing, and electrochemical
properties.17−24 Because photochromism is indeed enhanced in CTAB micelles (as demonstrated
previously3) and they are an important
ingredient for the formation of MCM-41 particles as templates, the
calcination step is avoided and the chalcone species are directly
incorporated in the CTAB micelles used for the synthesis of MCM-41.
Unusual optical properties arise
afterward, namely, high-fluorescence quantum yields and high-contrast
photochromic effects, depending on the adjusted pH.

Results and Discussion
The material MCM-41–Ct was prepared following literature
procedures16 and by adding flavylium salt
7-(N,N-diethylamino)-4′-hydroxyflavylium
tetrafluoroborate in the CTAB solution according to Scheme S1. The concentration of the dye in the final material
was estimated by UV–vis spectroscopy, extracting the dye from
the material using a 0.2 M HCl aqueous solution, giving a value of
0.05% (w/w), leaving the silica powder colorless. The X-ray powder
diffractogram shows four well-defined basal reflections indexed to
a hexagonal cell and typical of MCM-41 materials, a result also confirmed
with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Figure S3).

The resulting powder was obtained from solutions
at pH ca. 10,
which may be stored at room temperature in the dark for months with
no loss of optical properties. At such basic conditions, ionized chalcone
species should be predominant, namely, Ct– and Ct2–. These
species are usually colored, but without significant photochromic
or fluorescent properties because internal conversion processes completely
dominate their excited-state properties in low-viscosity media.1,3 That is not the case with the powder here synthesized at pH ca.
10, where a very bright photoluminescence was observed upon irradiation
with a UV-A light source (see Figure 1). A luminescence quantum efficiency of 46% was measured
using the diffuse sphere absolute method25 with an average luminescence lifetime of 302 ns (see Table 1). This shows a situation in
which nonradiative processes are greatly quenched, probably due to
the relatively viscous environment of the MCM-41 channels filled with
cylindrical CTAB micelles.

Figure 1 Emission and excitation spectra of MCM-41 noncalcined
powders with
the pores filled with CTAB entrapping Ct2– species (top, equilibrated at pH = 10), Ct– species (middle, equilibrated at pH =
7), or AH+ species (bottom, equilibrated
at pH = 1). Inset shows luminescence of the powders when exposed to
a 360 nm light source.

Table 1 Photophysical Properties of MCM-41
Flavylium Systems Equilibrated at Different pH Values
pH	λexmax/nm	λemmax/nm	ϕf/%	τ/ns	
1.0	560	631	32	2.8	
7.0	495	554	38	226	
10.0	495	559	46	302	
The next step toward the synthesis of a photochromic
powder is
the pH neutralization of Ct–/Ct2– species.
The pristine powder was immersed in buffered aqueous solutions with
a selected pH. The eventual lixiviation of the dye was monitored by
UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (Figure S7). After centrifugation, new powders were obtained and pump-dried.
As a result, at pH < 2, AH+ species were
obtained, whereas at intermediate pH values in the range between 2.5
< pH < 4.5, it was possible to obtain the a priori desired Ct species. Figure 2 shows the light absorption spectra of the
powder in the diffuse reflectance mode at different pH values. The
spectrum of acidic pHs shows absorption maxima at ca. 545 nm, which
corresponds to the presence of AH+ cations.
For pH values equal to 1.8 up to about 5, the spectra are dominated
by a band centered at 440 nm, which is assigned to the Ct species. Therefore, predictably, those are the powders in which
a photochromic effect would be prevalent.

Figure 2 Diffuse reflectance spectra
of MCM-41 noncalcined powders with
the pores filled with CTAB entrapping AH+/Ct/Ct–/Ct2– species depending
on the pH used for equilibration.

At pH = 7.0, ionized chalcone species are still prevalent,
and
therefore the powder is photoluminescent. Interestingly, the excitation
spectrum is very similar to that observed at pH = 10, although small
changes in the emission spectrum give rise to a more “greenish”
color with a slightly lower quantum efficiency (Figure 1 and Table 1). The hybrid material obtained from equilibration
at pH < 2 gives rise to AH+ species and is also highly photoluminescent (Figure 1 and Table 1). The luminescence quantum efficiency is 32%, and
the fluorescence decay has a lifetime of around 2.8 ns, in line with
the typical photophysical properties of flavylium cations. The photoluminescence
color shifts from green/yellow to pink, therefore it is possible to
tune light emission in these pigments with simple pH adjustments.

The neutral Ct species are usually the photochromic
active molecules of the flavylium chemical network.1 Results of Figure 2 already define the pH range in which photochromism may be
active (between 2.5 and 6). The irradiation effects on powders equilibrated
at pH = 2.7 are shown in Figure 3. After 5 min of irradiation at 445 nm (I0 = 7.53 × 10–8 einstein min–1), the color is developed, indicating the formation
of AH+ (maximum absorption at
550 nm) as it is typical of these systems in aqueous solutions as
well as in CTAB micelles, and an isosbestic point at 482 nm is observed,
which is a requirement for a “two-species”-like photochromic
effect. 1  The obvious advantage in
this case is that
the photochromic behavior is immobilized in the form of a pigment
powder. The system may be characterized as a photochromic switch between Ct and AH+ species. Afterward,
the system thermally reverts to its original state, therefore the
original Ct species is fully recovered. The recovery
process follows first-order kinetics, with t1/2 = 46 min (in CTAB micelles t1/2 was about 120 min).3

Figure 3 Absorption spectra in
the diffuse reflectance mode of the MCM-41–Ct
pigment equilibrated at pH = 2.7. (A) Change of absorption spectra
during irradiation with λirr = 445 nm (I0 = 7.53 × 10–8 einstein min–1) during 5 min. (B) Thermal recovery in the dark during
160 min after irradiation (room temperature, 23 °C).

A significant photochromic effect (i.e., with significant
color
contrast) was observed in the pH range 2.6 < pH < 4.8 (Figure S6). The spectroscopic measurements at
both irradiation and thermal re-equilibration show the same general
features, with, nevertheless, different final colored states because
at different pHs the AH+/A equilibrium determines the outcome. At pH = 4.8, the colored
species have maximum absorption at 572 nm, a 22 nm shift compared
to that at pH = 2.7, due to the fact that at this pH quinoidal base A predominates over AH+.

The hybrid photochromic powder is quite robust in terms of
long-term
photochemical stability. Without the presence of photochemical stabilizers,
the system shows large reversibility. At pH = 2.7, on/off irradiation
cycles (445 nm) were monitored by light absorption at 550 nm, and
the contrast remains the same after three cycles within our experimental
constraints (Figure 4).

cycles of the MCM-41–Ct pigment (pH
= 2.7) monitored at 550 nm following the same experimental details
described in Figure 3.

Conclusions
Hybrid mesoporous silica
particles enclosing a flavylium system
were synthesized. The optical properties can be adjusted by pH, showing
remarkable photoluminescent brightness and high quantum efficiencies.
These pigments also show high-contrast photochromic effects, thus
enabling for the first time the production of solid-state flavylium-based
photochromic systems with high reversibility.

Experimental Section
Materials
7-(N,N-Diethylamino)-4′-hydroxyflavylium
tetrafluoroborate was available from previous studies.2,3 All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Solutions were
prepared using Millipore water. The pH of solutions was adjusted by
addition of HCl, NaOH, or the universal buffer of Theorell and Stenhagen.26 CTAB and sodium silicate solution were purchased
from Aldrich.

Synthesis of MCM-41 Containing Ct of 7-(N,N-Diethylamino)-4′-hydroxyflavylium
(See Scheme S1)
The material was
prepared from a gel with the molar composition SiO2:0.29
Na2O:0.50 CTAB:150 H2O, and sodium silicate
solution (10.6% Na2O, 26.5% SiO2) was used as
the silica source. Specifically, 5.0 g sodium silicate solution was
diluted with 15 mL H2O and added slowly to a violet solution
of 4.07 g of CTAB ([(C16H33)N(CH3)3]Br) and 0.050 g of 7-(N,N-diethylamino)-4′-hydroxyflavylium tetrafluoroborate. The
molar ratio of CTAB/Fl is 87. A brown precipitate was formed immediately,
and the pH was adjusted from 11.6 to 10.0 with diluted H2SO4 (2 M). The mixture was stirred for 30 min, and then
the pH was readjusted to 10.0. After further stirring for 30 min,
the mixture was transferred to a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) bottle,
and the gel was crystallized under static conditions at 100 °C
for 2 days. The light yellow solid was recovered by filtration and
was dried at 80 °C for 2 days.

Structural Characterization
The room-temperature powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of MCM-41 type materials were collected
on a Rigaku, model MiniFlex II, diffractometer with a Cu Kα
(λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation source (30 kV, 15 mA). Measurements
were step-scanned in 0.02° 2θ steps in the 1–12°
range, with a scan speed of 0.5°/min. The textural characterization
was obtained from physical adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K, using a
Micrometrics ASAP 2010 V4 instrument. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area was calculated by using the relative pressure data in
the range 0.04–0.2. The total pore volume, Vp, was evaluated on the basis of the amount adsorbed at
a relative pressure of about 0.97. The pore size distributions were
obtained from the adsorption branches of the isotherms, applying the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method with the modified Kelvin
equation and a correction for the statistical film thickness of the
pore walls. The statistical film thickness was calculated using the
Harkins–Jura equation, in the p/p0 range of 0.1–0.95. Thermogravimetric analyses
were performed using TA Instruments SDT 2960 simultaneous differential
scanning calorimetry–thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a
heating rate of 10 °C min–1 from room temperature
to 700 °C. The mesoporous silica was also characterized by TEM
using a Hitachi H8100 TEM. The samples were supported on a carbon-coated
copper grid.

Preparation of the Samples at Different pH
Values (See Scheme S2)
The materials
were stirred
and then equilibrated at room temperature overnight in buffered water
solutions at specific pH values. The suspensions were centrifuged,
decanted, and finally dried under vacuum. Typically, 40.0 mg of the
material was suspended in 5 mL of the appropriate buffered solution.

Measurements
pH values were measured with a MeterLab
pHM240 pH meter from Radiometer Copenhagen. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis
spectra were acquired in a Shimadzu UV-2501PC equipped with an integrating
sphere. The powdered samples were smashed between two quartz lamellae,
and the spectra were run using an identical BaSO4-filled
support as the blank. The remission function, F(R), was calculated using the Kubelka–Munk equation
for optically thick samples. Irradiation experiments were carried
out in a spectrofluorimeter (Spex Fluorolog 3.22) equipped with a
150 W Xe–Hg lamp as the light source and using maximum slit
width, with the following conditions: λirr = 445
nm and I0 = 7.53 × 10–8 einstein min–1.

Fluorescence spectra were
recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog-3 Model FL3-22 spectrofluorimeter, and
luminescence quantum efficiencies were measured by the absolute method
with an Integrated Sphere.25 This method
was checked by measuring the fluorescence quantum yield of a solution
of Rhodamine 6G in ethanol, giving 96.6%, which compares very well
with the value reported in the literature (95% in ref (27)).

Time-resolved
fluorescence decays were acquired by the time-correlated
single-photon counting technique using two different home-built equipment.
The samples were excited at 370 nm using a nanoled (IBH).The electronic
start pulses were shaped in a constant fraction discriminator (Canberra
2126) and directed to a time to amplitude converter (TAC, Canberra
2145). The emission wavelength was selected by a monochromator (Oriel
77250) imaged in a fast photomultiplier (9814B Electron Tubes Inc.).
The phase modulation signal was shaped as before and delayed before
entering the TAC as stop pulses. The analogue TAC signals were digitized
(ADC, ND582) and stored in a multichannel analyzer installed in a
PC (1024 channels).
