The stereoselective
total synthesis of cytotoxic marine macrolide
callyspongiolide has been reported. The 14-membered macrolactone ring
along with Z-olefin in the molecule was constructed
via an intramolecular Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons olefination
in a Z-selective fashion. The other E-olefinic moiety as well as the C9 stereocenter was introduced via
stereoselective addition of the methyl group in an SN2′
fashion. The C5 stereocenter was installed via Sakurai allylation,
whereas the C7 center was fixed by Jacobsen hydrolytic kinetic resolution.
The C12 methyl and C13 hydroxy centers were fixed via Macmillan coupling
reaction. The macrolactone core with a vinyl iodide side chain was
coupled with the known alkyne fragment to complete the synthesis.

Introduction
Secondary metabolites
produced by marine organisms have attracted
the considerable attention of synthetic organic chemists, because
of their interesting structure and function.1 Among various marine organisms, sponge belonging to genus Callyspongia is a rich source of various potent antiproliferative
agents, such as polyketides, polyacetylenes, alkaloids, and cyclic
peptides.2 Callyspongiolide, a cytotoxic
marine natural product, was isolated by Proksch and co-workers in
2014 from the marine sponge of Callyspongia sp.3 A detailed NMR study revealed that
callyspongiolide has a 14-membered lactone ring having five stereocenters
and two alkene functionalities connected to a brominated benzene ring
with a diene-ynic chain (Figure 1). The relative stereochemistry of the lactone part
was established
via the detailed NMR study; however, Proksch et al. were unsuccessful
in determining the absolute stereochemistry of the C21 center, as
they failed to acylate the C21–OH group with Mosher’s
acid. Apart from its complex architecture, callyspongiolide has shown
promising cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines. It
inhibits the growth of mouse lymphoma (L5178Y) cells with an IC50 value of 320 nM. It was also found to be highly cytotoxic
to human cell lines [Jurkat J16T (IC50 = 70 nM) and Ramos
B lymphocytes (IC50 = 60 nM)].3 The complex architecture, important biological activity, and structural
issue of callyspongiolide have become a synthetic target for synthetic
organic chemists. The first elegant total synthesis and stereochemical
assignment of callyspongiolide were reported by Ye and co-workers
in 20 steps with an overall yield of 8.6%.4 Subsequently, Ghosh et al.5a reported
the total synthesis of both epimers at C21 of the proposed structure
of cytotoxic macrolide (+)-callyspongiolide in 22 steps with an overall
yield of 3.32% and confirmed the stereochemical assignment at the
C21 position established by Ye and co-workers. Furthermore, Ghosh
et al. synthesized four different stereoisomers of callyspongiolide
and unambiguously confirmed the absolute stereochemistry at the C21
center.5b Besides, Kotora and co-workers
also synthesized the unsaturated fragment of callyspongiolide.6 Very recently, Harran and co-workers reported
a well-designed total synthesis of (−)-callyspongiolide in
18 steps with an overall yield of 1% by using an unconventional fragment.7 Because of our constant interest in the area
of total synthesis of marine natural products,8 we were attracted by callyspongiolide because of its interesting
structure and function and reported a strategy for making the macrolactone
part of (+)-callyspongiolide.9 In this
article, we reported the total synthesis of callyspongiolide by utilizing
the knowledge developed by us.

Results and Discussion
Inspection
of the structure of callyspongiolide revealed that a
Sonogashira coupling between vinyl iodide-containing macrolactone 2 and ene-yne fragment terminated with the substituted bromobenzene
ring 3 would give callyspongiolide. The 14-membered macrolactone
ring would be obtained from compound 5 via installation
of a Z-double bond at the C2–C3 position by
intramolecular Z-selective Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
reaction (Scheme 1).
The phosphonate 5 might be obtained from alcohol 6 via acylation with
diaryl phosphonoacetic acid followed by functional group manipulation.
The vinyl iodide 6 could be obtained from alcohol 7 through oxidation followed by Takai olefination. The C9-methyl
center and C10–C11 E-olefinic moiety might
be installed via addition of methyl on the C9 carbon in an SN2′ fashion. Thus, reduction of the alkyne functionality of 9 under Lindlar conditions followed by an esterification reaction
with 2-picolinic acid would give compound 8. The propargylic
alcohol 9 could be obtained by the reaction of the anion
generated from alkyne 10 with the aldehyde 11 that could be obtained by proline-catalyzed aldol reaction developed
by the Macmillan group.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis
According to the retrosynthetic plan, our synthesis
commenced from
known compound 14, which was prepared on a multigram
scale via conjugate addition of allyltrimethylsilane to α,β-unsaturated N-acyloxazolidinone 13.10 The removal of chiral auxiliary from 14 with
LiBH4 produced an alcohol, which on protection with TBDPSCl
in the presence of Et3N in CH2Cl2 furnished compound 12 in 89% over two steps. To fix
the C7-hydroxy center of the molecule, the olefinic moiety of compound 12 was subjected to epoxidation with m-CPBA
to furnish a diastereomeric mixture of terminal epoxide, which on
hydrolytic kinetic resolution with (R,R)-12a salen provided diastereomerically pure terminal epoxide 15 (de > 92%, 40%) and diol compound 16 (de > 90%,
44%).11 The diol compound 16 was converted
back into the required epoxide by following a three-step sequence,
as shown in Scheme 2.7c The regioselective opening of terminal epoxide with
TMS-acetylene in the presence of BF3·OEt2 as a Lewis acid took place from the less hindered side of the epoxide
and afforded alcohol 17 in 89% yield with the required
stereochemistry at the C7-position. Finally, TBS protection of the
secondary hydroxyl group followed by TMS deprotection with K2CO3/MeOH provided alkyne compound 10 in 85%
yield.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Alkyne Fragment 10
After synthesizing the alkyne fragment, our
next objective was
to synthesize the aldehyde fragment 11, and this was
planned via d-proline-catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction
developed by Macmillan. Accordingly, the known aldehyde compound was
synthesized on a large scale12 (Scheme 3) and reduced with
NaBH4 to give an alcohol 21, which on TBDPS
deprotection with TBAF, followed by acetonide protection of the resulting
triol, afforded compound 22 in 64% yield over two steps.13 Finally, DMP (Dess–Martin periodinane)-mediated
oxidation of the primary alcohol 22 furnished aldehyde 11.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Aldehyde Fragment 11
Having both fragments 10 and 11 in our
hand, we planned to couple them together. Accordingly, alkyne compound 10 on treatment with n-BuLi gave an anion
that on reaction with the aldehyde 11 gave a diastereomeric
mixture of alcohols (2:1), which on DMP oxidation afforded alkynone 23 in 69% over two steps. Alkynone 23 was subjected
to Noyori reduction with (S,S)-Ru catalyst in the
presence of IPA to afford alcohol 9 in 88% yield (de
> 95%).14 Now, to fix the C9 center
and
the C10–C11 E-olefinic moiety present in the
molecule, the alkyne was partially reduced with H2 in the
presence of 5% Pd on BaSO4 in a mixture of solvents EtOAc/Py/1-octene
(10:1:1) to provide Z-allylic alcohol 24,15 which was acylated with 2-picolinic
acid to give the precursor 8 (77% over two steps) for
asymmetric allylic alkylation. Regio- and stereoselective allylic
substitutions were performed via addition of MeMgBr in the presence
of Me2S·CuBr complex to give compound 25 with good yield and excellent stereoselectivity.16 Acetonide deprotection in the presence of TBS and TBDPS
was a tricky problem. However, compound 25 on treatment
with ZnBr2 in CH2Cl2 furnished diol 26 in good yield.17 Protection
of the diol as PMB acetal followed by opening of the acetal with DIBAL-H
gave primary alcohol 7 in 78% over two steps.18 Oxidation of alcohol 7 under DMP
conditions gave an aldehyde, which on Takai olefination afforded E-alkenyl iodide compound 28 in 87% yield (E:Z = 7:1).19 Selective oxidative removal of PMB from compound 28 was carried out with DDQ (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone)
to afford secondary alcohol 6 in 94% yield (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Compound 6
Having the desired
fragment 6 in hand, we planned
to construct 14-membered macrocycle 2. Accordingly, under
Yamaguchi conditions, 2-(bis(2-tert-butylphenoxy)phosphoryl)
acetic acid was esterified with the alcohol 6 to provide
compound 29 in 82% yield.20 Selectively, TBDPS was removed in the presence of NH4F to give primary alcohol 29A in 76% yield,21 which on DMP oxidation afforded aldehyde 5. At this stage, the crucial intramolecular Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
reaction was carried out by using NaH in THF at high dilution to furnish
macrolactone 2 with good yield and Z-selectivity (Z:E = 80:20).22 Finally, deprotection of TBS group from 2 provided secondary alcohol 30 (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Macrolactone
Core 30
The remaining part of the synthesis is depicted
in Scheme 6. The known
compound 32 was synthesized via minor modification of
the existing
route.4,5 Selective deprotection of TMS and TBS with
K2CO3 in methanol followed by protection of
the phenolic–OH group as TBS ether furnished compound 3. Sonogashira coupling between alkyne 3 and
vinyl iodide 30 went smoothly in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI in THF and furnished compound 33.4 Finally, installation of the
carbamate group23 followed by global deprotection
of the silyl groups completed the synthesis of (−)-callyspongiolide 1 in 86% yield over two steps as a white solid. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of synthetic callyspongiolide
exactly matched with the data reported in the literature.7 Furthermore, the optical rotation of synthetic
callyspongiolide 1 [α]D = −20.8
(c 0.6, MeOH) was very close to those reported in
the literature [α]D = −12.5,3 −13.1,7 −13.0,4 and −25.55a (c 0.1, MeOH).

Conclusions
In summary, the total synthesis of the
anticancer marine natural
product callyspongiolide has been achieved in 25 longest linear sequences
from known compound 12 with an overall yield of 1.12%.
The key reactions involved in our synthesis are Z-selective intramolecular Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction,
organocatalytic Macmillan coupling, Cu-catalyzed asymmetric allylic
alkylation, Takai olefination, and Sonogashira coupling. Although
the route of the present synthesis is a bit lengthy, the synthetic
strategy reported here is quite different from the strategy developed
by others. In addition, the key fragments can be synthesized easily
on a large scale from commercially available cheap starting materials.
Furthermore, the strategy is highly convergent and can be used for
the synthesis of analogues. Currently, we are working in that direction,
which will be reported in due course.

Methods
All reagents were purchased from available
commercial sources. Moisture- and air-sensitive reactions were carried
out under an argon atmosphere. Anhydrous dichloromethane and chloroform
were prepared via distillation over calcium hydride. Diethyl ether,
dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran were dried by using sodium metal and
distilled before use. All reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
using UV light followed by PMA, iodine, ninhydrin, and p-anisaldehyde for visualization. All the compounds
were purified via column chromatography by using a glass column packed
with silica gel of 60–120, 100–200, or 230–400
mesh size. All the solvents used for purification were of technical
grade and distilled before use. All 1H spectra were recorded
at 300, 400, and 500 MHz, whereas all the 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 75, 100, and 125 MHz at ambient temperature by using
CDCl3 as solvent. In all spectra, coupling constant J was measured in Hz. Chemical shifts (δ) of all spectra
data were reported in ppm scale downfield from TMS using the residual
solvent peak in CDCl3 (H: δ = 7.26, C: δ =
77.0 ppm) or TMS (δ = 0.0) as internal standard. All splitting
patterns in spectral data were indicated as follows: s = singlet,
d = doublet, dd = doublet of doublet, dt = doublet of triplet, ddd
= doublet of doublet of doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, qd = quartet
of doublet, m = multiplet, and br = broad. FTIR spectra of all compounds
were reported as cm–1 and recorded on a Bruker infrared
spectrophotometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded
on Orbitrap and TOFMS spectrometers.

LiBH4 (4.51 g, 205 mmol) was added portionwise to the
stirred solution of compound 14 (28 g, 102 mmol) in dry
diethyl ether (180 mL) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed
to be stirred for 1 h at the same temperature followed by quenching
with saturated aqueous NH4Cl (200 mL) and extraction with
diethyl ether (500 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed
with water (30 mL) and brine (20 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo at 20 °C to give crude alcohol
(11.4 g, 101 mmol), which was dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (500 mL) and treated with Et3N (26 mL,
183 mmol), TBDPSCl (28.7 mL, 110 mmol), and DMAP (1.12 g, 9.16 mmol)
at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 24 h, and then it was quenched with a saturated aqueous solution
of NH4Cl (200 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (700 mL). After
washing the combined organic extracts with brine (100 mL), it was

To the solution of olefin 12 (32 g, 91 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (180 mL) at 0 °C
was added m-CPBA (70%, 23.4 g, 136 mmol) and stirred
at room temperature for
10 h. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was quenched
with a saturated solution of aqueous NaHCO3 (200 mL), and
the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was further extracted
with EtOAc (2 × 200 mL). Combined organic extracts were washed
successively with saturated NaHCO3 (100 mL) and brine (100
mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation
of the organic solvents followed by purification of the resulting
crude product via silica gel flash column chromatography (SiO2, 2% EtOAc in hexane) furnished a diastereomeric mixture of
epoxides (31.2 g, 93%) as colorless oil [Rf = 0.6 (SiO2, 10% EtOAc/hexane)]. A mixture of (R,R)-salen CoII precatalyst
(246 mg, 0.407 mmol) in toluene (15 mL) and AcOH (94 μL, 1.63
mmol) was stirred in air for 1 h at room temperature. After 1.5 h,
the solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure,
and the brown residue was dried under vacuum. The (+/−)-epoxide
(30 g, 81.5 mmol) prepared above was added to the reaction flask,
and the reaction mixture was cooled on an ice water bath. Water (880
μL, 49 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for
24 h at room temperature. The enantiomerically pure epoxide and the
diol were purified through column chromatography (SiO2,
2% EtOAc in hexane) to furnish epoxide 15 (de > 92%)
as colorless oil (12 g, 40%) [Rf = 0.6

Experimental Procedure for the Conversion of Diol Compound 16 to the Required Epoxide 15
A solution
of compound 16 (14 g, 36.4 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (100 mL) was treated with Et3N (6.2 mL,
43.7 mmol) followed by pivaloyl chloride (5 mL, 40.4 mmol) at 0 °C
and stirred for 5 h at the same temperature. Then, the reaction mixture
was warmed to room temperature, and a saturated solution of aqueous
NH4Cl solution was added. The reaction mixture was extracted
with EtOAc (2 × 150 mL), and the combined organic layers were
washed with saturated CuSO4 solution (100 mL), water (100
mL), and brine (100 mL). After drying the organic extracts over anhydrous
Na2SO4, it was filtered and evaporated under
reduced pressure. The pivaloyl-protected compound (Rf =
0.5, 40% EtOAc in hexane) thus obtained was used for the next step
after passing through a silica gel column.

To a solution of
pivaloyl compound prepared above (15 g, 31.9 mmol) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (70 mL) was added Et3N (8.9 mL,
63.8 mmol) at 0 °C and stirred for 10 min. Then, MsCl (3.7 mL,
47.25 mmol), followed by DMAP (40 mg, 0.47 mmol), was added to the
reaction mixture, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 2 h. A saturated solution of aqueous NH4Cl was added
to the reaction mixture, and it was extracted with EtOAc (200 mL).
The combined organic extracts were washed successively with water
(70 mL) and brine (70 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure provided
a crude mesylate compound (Rf = 0.5, 20%
EtOAc in hexane), which was used directly for the next reaction without
purification.

The crude mesylate (16 g, 29 mmol) was dissolved
in dry methanol
(100 mL) at room temperature and treated with anhydrous K2CO3 (8.1 g, 58.3 mmol) under a nitrogen atmosphere. After
stirring for 6 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted
with water and then extracted with EtOAc (2 × 200 mL). The combined
organic extracts were washed with water (70 mL) and brine (50 mL)
and dried over Na2SO4. Purification of the crude
product by column chromatography (SiO2, 2% EtOAc in hexane)
gave pure compound 15 (8 g, 59%, over three steps) as
colorless oil.

A stirred solution of TMS acetylene (8.63
mL, 61.10 mmol) in anhydrous THF (80 mL) was treated with n-BuLi (48.9 mL, 1 M in hexane) at −78 °C and
stirred for 30 min. Then, BF3·OEt2 (5.7
mL, 46.8 mmol) was added to the above reaction mixture and stirred
for 10 min. Epoxide 15 (15 g, 40.7 mmol) dissolved in
THF (10 mL) was cannulated to the reaction mixture, and the mixture
was stirred for 2 h at −78 °C. A saturated solution of
aqueous NH4Cl (100 mL) was added to the reaction mixture.
The reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2 × 250 mL), and
the combined organic extracts were washed with brine (100 mL) and
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of
organic solvents under reduced pressure provided a crude reaction
product, which on purification via column chromatography (SiO2, 5% EtOAc/hexane) furnished the title compound 17 as colorless oil (17 g, 89%). Rf = 0.4
