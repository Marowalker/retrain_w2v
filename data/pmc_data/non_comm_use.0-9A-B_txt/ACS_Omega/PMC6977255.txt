The dimensional stable lead electrodes
modified by sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) were prepared with electrochemical deposition and it
shows that a more compact, uniform, and smooth film of Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode reduces the corroded crystal faces and surface
defects. Characterization results demonstrate that the oxygen evolution
potential (OEP) of the Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode was higher,
and its service life is almost 1.6 times longer than the Ti/PbO2(F) electrode. Compared with Ti/PbO2(F) electrode,
the soluble Pb concentration of the Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode
decreased 15.1%, which indicates that the decrease of crystal surface
defects leads to the reduction of Pb ions so that the excellent corrosion
resistance electrodes cause low environmental risks. The modified
electrodes were used as anodes to degrading bisphenol A (BPA) when
an electrolyte is 0.2 M Na2SO4, the applied
voltage is 5 V and electrodes distance is 3 cm, 20 mg/L BPA for electrolysis
time of 180 min can reach up to 97.6%.

1 Introduction
Advanced
oxidation process (AOP) is a kind of technology that converts
organic molecules into small molecules, CO2, H2O, etc. by reactive hydroxyl radicals reacting with organic matter
in wastewater so that complex organic pollutants can be oxidized and
removed effectively.1,2 Electrocatalytic oxidation technology
is one of the AOPs technologies and has many outstanding advantages:
high activity, strong oxidizing ability, high degradation efficiency,
simple operation, low cost, and environmentally friendliness.3−6 Anodic material exists as a core element in the process of electrochemical
oxidation and has attracted the attention of more and more researchers.
A kind of popular anodic material is titanium-based lead dioxide (Ti/PbO2) electrode, which is widely used for its good conductivity,
high oxygen evolution potential, low cost, and high electrocatalytic
efficiency.6−8 Currently, preparing Ti/PbO2 electrode
is mainly electrochemical deposition.9−13 Although it has been widely used in industrial production,
there are still some defects that need to be overcome, such as low
adhesion of the plating layer, peeling easily, instability in the
electrolysis process, and weak corrosion resistance.9 Numerous studies6,8,10−19 have shown that the catalytic activity and stability of the electrodes
can be improved by doping specific metal elements (Bi, Co, Fe, Ni,
Ce), manufacturing nano and microstructured deposits and forming oxide
composites.

Further research on the modification of the Ti/PbO2 electrode
is a focus. To prevent oxidation of the substrate, increase the bonding
force between the lead dioxide coating and the substrate, and reduce
interfacial resistance and internal stress, an electrode having an
intermediate layer (Sb–SnO2) may be prepared on
the substrate.20 It is mentioned in the
literature10,11,15,21,22 that F can
effectively improve the bonding strength and stability of the Ti/PbO2 film and increase the oxygen evolution potential, while the
addition of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (a common anion surfactant,
SDBS)10,23 can change the surface of the electrode
in addition to improving the bonding force. In the present review,
we report that a dimensional stable lead electrode having the Sb–SnO2 film is modified by Nafion (anionic polyelectrolyte)10 and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) prepared by
the electrodeposition method. The characterization of Ti/PbO2 electrodes was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), steady-state polarization curves, and we investigate
the electrode stability by electrode accelerated life test.

In recent years, endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have attracted
widespread attention for interfering with the normal function of the
endocrine system of humans and wild animals. It is observed from different
studies that we are surrounded by a wide range of EDCs in our daily
life.24,25 As a known EDC, bisphenol A (2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane,
BPA) is widely used in the manufacture of epoxy, polycarbonate, and
many plastic products (food and drink packaging, food, and beverage
cans, water bottles, PVC pipes, etc.).12,25−28 The residual BPA was possibly released into the water due to incomplete
reaction resulting in the widespread existence of BPA. Hence, the
purification of residual BPA in wastewater with low degradation rate
needs a considerable amount of attention and it is urgent to minimize
its contamination and remove it effectively.13,25,29

The dimensional stable lead electrode
modified by SDS was used
as anodes to degrading BPA, the effect of electrolyte, electrolyte
concentration, BPA initial concentration, electrode distance, applied
voltage, and current density of degradation reaction were systematically
studied. When electrolyte was 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution,
the applied voltage was 5 V, initial concentration of BPA was 20 mg/L,
electrodes distance was 3 cm, after 180 min, BPA removal efficiency
reached up to 97.6%.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the Electrodes
2.1.1 SEM
Characterization
The SEM images
of electrodes with 500 and 3000 times magnification were shown in Figure 1a–f, which
could be helpful to observe the morphology of the electrodes. Figure 1a,b shows that the
PbO2 film presents pyramid structure and crystals are closely
arranged, and as shown in Figure 1b, an obvious change in the PbO2 film occurs
by adding SDS. Evidently, preparing Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) in an
electroplating bath of an extra 0.05 g of SDS electrode forms a more
compact, uniform, and smooth film, when the magnification was 3000
times in Figure 1d,
crystals can still be observed in the pyramid structure. As we all
known, SDS is typical anionic surfactant that can make the Pb ions
disperse evenly in the solution to obtain the coating with the symmetrical
distribution of PbO2 particles, forming a uniform, compact,
and smooth film. As we all know, SDS is a typical anionic surfactant
that can make the Pb ions disperse evenly in the solution to obtain
the coating with the symmetrical distribution of PbO2 particles,
forming a uniform, compact, and smooth film. Due to the effect of
SDS, the PbO2 particles were separated from each other,
which could not agglomerate in large size. Thus, the size of PbO2 particles became smaller with additional SDS.30 As shown in Figure 1a–e, the distribution of PbO2 particles became denser with an increase of Nafion, while excessive
Nafion will cause damage to the pyramid structure (as shown in Figure 1f).

of Ti/PbO2(F) and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode;
(g) XRD images of Ti/PbO2(F)
and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrodes.

2.1.2 XRD Characterization
The crystal
structure of the electrodes were examined by XRD, and a comparison
of XRD patterns of electrodes is shown in Figure 1g. All the diffraction peaks were corresponding
to the standard card and well-indexed to β-PbO2,
which were assigned to the (110), (101), (200), (211), (220), (301),
(320), and (400) planes of β-PbO2 at 25.28, 31.92,
36.10, 49.04, 52.08, 58.86, 62.48, 66.96, and 74.42°, respectively.12,31 The diffraction peaks intensities of (101) and (301) planes of Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode were larger than that of Ti/PbO2(F) electrode, which means the increased degree of order of β-PbO2 with adding SDS.30 However, the
diffraction peak intensities of (110), (211), (220), (301), and (400)
planes of Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode decreased with the increase
of Nafion,10 which reduces the corroded
crystal faces and surface defects. Generally, the increase of surface
defects leads to the increase of hydroxyl oxygen, resulting in more
free Pb ions existing in solution, which could cause the dissolution
of Pb. While Nafion and SDS make the electrode surface smoother reducing
the surface defects, in this condition, Ti/PbO2(F+SDS)
electrode could be more stable for less dissolved Pb ions.

2.2 Electrochemical Performance of the Electrodes
2.2.1 Steady-State Polarization Curves
The steady-state polarization
curves of the electrode tests were
measured in 0.1 mol/L of HClO4 at a scan rate of 1 mV/s.
As shown in Figure 2a, Ti/PbO2(F, 30 μL) electrode has the highest oxygen
evolution overpotential (OEP). The oxygen evolution overpotential
variation with SDS content is shown in Figure 2b when the F content was 10 μL, the
Ti/PbO2(SDS, 0.05 g) OEP was slightly higher than that
of Ti/PbO2(SDS, 0.10 g). The modified electrode OEP by
Nafion and SDS measured by mean of steady-state polarization curves
and the OEP of Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) was as shown in Figure 2c. The results demonstrated
that the existence of F could somewhat increase the OEP of Ti/PbO2 inhibiting the oxygen evolution reaction to improve the stability
of electrodes effectively, and the OEP of electrodes could be increased
due to existing SDS, also.19,23,30,31

curves in 0.1 M HClO4 at a scan rate of 1 mV/s for Ti/PbO2(F) and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrodes; (d) slopes of
the current to different
scan rates.

2.2.2 Electrochemical
Surface Area
The
difference in the oxidation activity of PbO2 electrodes
made from anode area was researched by the electrochemical surface
area (ECSA). ECSA is generally considered to be a significant parameter
for OER performance, which is proportional to the active sites involved
in electrochemical reactions, the specific calculation method references
the literature.32 The experiments were
carried out in 0.1 mol/L HClO4 between 1.4 and 1.6 V (vs
SCE) with scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV/s. As shown in Figure 2d, we can estimate
that the ECSA of Ti/PbO2(F) is 0.04 cm2 and
that of Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) is 0.15 cm2. Thus, the
introduction of Nafion and SDS not only reduces the corroded crystal
faces and surface defects but also makes the nature in the oxidation activity of Ti/PbO2 anode
have a change.

2.3 Electrode Accelerated Lifetime
Test
As known, the electrode stability is an important factor
for practical
application in an industrial scale, while testing electrode stability
is usually time-consuming. Therefore, the accelerated life test for
electrodes (as Figure 3 shown) was carried out in 2.0 M H2SO4 solution
at a current density of 1 A/cm2 at 60 °C for reducing
test time at the electrolyte volume of 100 mL, which both repeated
for three times. At the beginning of the test, its potential was about
4 V and a sharp increase during the last hours was observed. For Ti/PbO2(F) electrode, as line 1, 2, 3 shows, the service life was
approximately 119, 128, and 143 h, respectively, and for line 4, 5,
6, for Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode, it can be estimated that
the service life was 188, 223, and 228 h, respectively. It was obvious
that the accelerated lifetime of the Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode
was 1.6–1.7 times than that of the Ti/PbO2(F) electrode.

Figure 3 (a) Potential
variation with electrolysis time in accelerated life
test for Ti/PbO2(F) (1, 2, 3) and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS)
(4, 5, 6); (b) XRD patterns for Ti/PbO2 of accelerated
life test for 60, 120 h.

Actually, Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode has the denser and
smoother surface than Ti/PbO2(F) electrode, which can inhibit
the penetration of electrolytes into the interior of the electrode,
therefore, less corrosion would occur and the effect on the conductivity
is slight. Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode has a higher oxygen
evolution potential than Ti/PbO2(F) electrode and oxygen
evolution reaction on Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode is reduced,
which explains the longer service life.12,19

Generally,
the service life of electrodes should be closely related
to using conditions (current density, temperature, pH, etc.), and
accessing the actual service life in industrial applications is certainly
difficult. At present, there is an empirical judgment33 in the academic community about the relationship between
actual service life and its using conditions, which was described
as follows 1  where τ2 is the calculated
life (h), τ1 is the accelerated life (h), i1 is the current density of accelerated test
(A/m2), i2 is the current density
of using under actual conditions (A/m2), and i2 is generally 1000 A/m2.

Thus, take
the maximum value of τ1 for a example,
τ2 of Ti/PbO2(F) was obtained to be 14 300
h (1.63a) and τ2 of Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) was
22 800 h (2.60a), the service life of Ti/PbO2(F+SDS)
electrode is about 1.6 times longer than Ti/PbO2(F) electrode.
Soluble lead concentration in electrolytic solution measured by ICP
was reduced by 15.1% at Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode.

The crystal structure of Ti/PbO2 during the accelerated
life test was examined by XRD, and a comparison of XRD patterns of
60, 120 h was shown in Figure 3b. The diffraction peak intensities of (110), (101), (211),
(220), and (400) planes of Ti/PbO2 electrode decreased
with time going by, which means the decreased degree of order of β-PbO2.

2.4 Effect of Experimental Conditions of BPA Degradation
2.4.1 Effect of Electrolyte
The effect
of electrolyte for BPA degradation at BPA initial concentration of
20 mg/L is shown in Figure 4, electrode distance of 3 cm, applied voltage of 5 V, and
electrolysis time of 180 min. The electrolytes were NaCl, Na2SO4, NaH2PO4, and Na2HPO4, respectively, and the concentration of electrolyte
was 0.02 mol/L.

Figure 4 (a) Degradation of BPA in different electrolyte types
by Ti/PbO2(F); (b) the degradation of BPA in different
electrolyte types
by Ti/PbO2(F+SDS); (c) the BPA removal efficiency in different
electrolyte types by two electrodes for 60 min; (d) the BPA removal
efficiency in different electrolyte types by two electrodes for 180
min.

The electrolyte types made a great
influence on BPA degradation.
As shown in Figure 4a, the removal efficiency of BPA was the best in NaCl solution and
it reached up to 93.54% by Ti/PbO2(F) for 180 min, which
was much higher than others (44.8% in Na2SO4, 22.4% in NaH2PO4, 29.5% in Na2HPO4). At the same time, as shown in Figure 4b, the trend of BPA removal
efficiency by Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) was same as Ti/PbO2(F), it performed as that BPA removal efficiency was 92.0% in NaCl,
43.9% in Na2SO4, 25.3% in NaH2PO4, and 21.8% in Na2HPO4. The electrocatalytic
oxidation performance of two electrodes has only slight differences
as shown in Figure 4c,d. The relationship of BPA removal efficiency by Ti/PbO2(F) for 60 min in different electrolyte types was NaCl (60.2%) >
Na2HPO4 (16.9%) > Na2SO4 (15.7%) > NaH2PO4 (13.6%), which was different
from the degradation efficiency by Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) [NaCl
(53.0%) > Na2SO4 (19.7%) > NaH2PO4 (13.2%) > Na2HPO4 (12.6%)].
The Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) showed better activity in Na2SO4 solution than Ti/PbO2(F) while it was opposite
in NaCl
solution for 60 min. NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 were not considered as an electrolyte for the next
research for low BPA removal efficiency with them. And in the remaining
two electrolyte types, the electrocatalytic oxidation performance
of two electrodes performed consistently, which was that BPA removal
efficiency by Ti/PbO2(F) was slightly higher than Ti/PbO2(F+SDS).

It is clear that BPA removal efficiency is
higher in NaCl solution
than that in Na2SO4 solution. Whereas, it is
because that chlorite ions, hypochlorite ions and other strong oxidation
species that produced by Cl– reacting with OH radical
make the great effect on degradation of BPA.34 Thus, to eliminate the influence of Cl–, we choose
Na2SO4 solution as electrolyte for reflecting
the oxygen evolution activity of Ti/PbO2 electrode more
accurately.

2.4.2 Effect of Electrolyte
Concentration
In this paper, Na2SO4 was chosen to be the
electrolyte of BPA degradation and the degradation curves in different
Na2SO4 concentrations by the electrodes were
as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a presents
the BPA removal efficiency variation with electrolysis time by Ti/PbO2(F) and it is obvious that the higher Na2SO4 concentration has a better degradation effect. Even, when
the concentrations of Na2SO4 were 0.15 M and
0.2 M, BPA removal efficiency reached up to 100% after 120 min. For
Ti/PbO2(F+SDS), as shown in Figure 5b, the change in law of BPA removal efficiency
with increasing Na2SO4 concentration was the
same as Ti/PbO2(F), however, when Na2SO4 concentration was 0.2 M, BPA removal efficiency was 97.6%,
which was lower. A comparison of the degradation effects of the electrodes
could be observed intuitively in Figure 5c, as Na2SO4 concentration
increased, the BPA removal effect of the Ti/PbO2(F) electrode
was better than Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode more distinctly. The result could be explained as
improving the stability of electrodes by inhibiting the oxygen evolution
reaction and further reducing the generation of hydroxyl radicals,
which made the Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode to have lower electrochemical
activity.

(c) the BPA removal efficiency in different Na2SO4 concentrations by two electrodes for 180 min.

2.4.3 Effect of Initial Concentration of BPA
The effect of initial BPA concentration on the electrodes is shown
in Figure 6a,b. The
initial BPA concentrations for study were 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg/L
in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution, respectively, the
electrode distance was 3.0 cm and the applied voltage was 5 V. It
can be observed that the BPA removal efficiency can reach up to 100%
after 120 min, while the BPA degradation rate became more and more
slow with initial increase in BPA concentration. It is a fact that
the unusual dependence of the reaction rate from BPA initial concentration
exists in the degradation process. As well known, the degradation
reaction rate was mainly depended on the speed of organic matter migration
to the surface of the electrode. It presents that the reaction rate
decreases with the increase in initial BPA concentration. As the initial
BPA concentration increases, it transfers more BPA to the surface
of the electrode so that it could prevent contact between the BPA
and the active species, which result in a decrease in reaction rate.12,19,23

Figure 6 Effect of initial BPA concentrations (a,
b), electrode distance
(c, d), applied voltage (e, f) and current density (g, h) for degradation
of BPA by Ti/PbO2(F) and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS).

2.4.4 Effect of Electrode Distance
As
shown in Figure 6c,d,
the effect of electrode distance on BPA degradation was investigated
in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution at electrode distance
of 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 cm, respectively, the initial BPA concentration
was 20 mg/L and the applied voltage was 5 V. The BPA removal efficiency
was observed to reach up to 100% after 180 min and the difference
of different electrode distance was not very obvious, the Ti/PbO2(F) electrode showed faster degradation rate than the Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode. When the electrode distance is 2 cm, the
Ti/PbO2(F) electrode has the fastest degradation rate of
BPA degradation, for the Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode, the
electrode distance of 2.5 cm displayed the best result. The effect
of electrode distance on BPA degradation process could be related
to the resistance of the system, and the electrode distance chosen
to be researched is 3.0 cm whose BPA removal efficiency was ideal
within the determined electrolysis time.19

2.4.5 Effect of Applied Voltage
The effect
of applied voltage on BPA degradation was shown in Figure 6e,f in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution at electrode distance of 3.0 cm, the initial
BPA concentration was 20 mg/L and the applied voltages were 3, 4,
5, and 6 V, respectively. Clearly, when applied voltage increases,
BPA removal efficiency increased for Ti/PbO2(F) electrode
and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode. For Ti/PbO2(F)
electrode, BPA removal efficiencies were both 100% at the applied
voltages of 5 and 6 V after 180 min, simultaneously, 66.7 and 89.3%
of BPA was removed at the applied voltages of 3 and 4 V, respectively.
For Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode, when the electrolysis time
was 180 min, 69.4, 85.2, 97.6, and 100% of BPA could be removed at
the applied voltages of 3, 4, 5, and 6 V, respectively. Whereas, the
increase of the applied voltage brings out more energy consumption
and the electrode service life is also affected by an increased applied
voltage.12,35 Hence, to save energy, the applied voltage
of 5 V was chosen in the experiment ensuring complete degradation
of BPA within 180 min of electrolysis time.

2.4.6 Effect
of Current Density
The effect
of current density was as shown in Figure 6g,h in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution at an electrode distance of 3.0 cm at the applied voltage
of 5 V, the initial BPA concentration was 20 mg/L and the current
densities were 20, 40, 60, and 80 mA/cm2, respectively.
Similarly, BPA removal efficiency by Ti/PbO2(F) electrode
was a little higher than that by the Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode.
When the current density was 20 mA/cm2, 77.2% of BPA was
removed in the degradation system by Ti/PbO2(F) electrode
and BPA removal efficiency was 69.4% by Ti/PbO2(F+SDS)
electrode after 180 min, and BPA removal efficiency was 97.9% by Ti/PbO2(F) electrode and 97.8% of BPA was removed by Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode at the current density of 40 mA/cm2.
When the current densities were 60 and 80 mA/cm2, BPA could
be removed completely within 180 min, and BPA removal efficiency has
reached up to 100% with electrolysis time of 120 min. The reason why
the current density was studied is that it is related to the generation
of hydroxyl radicals.36 As Figure 6g,h shows, the BPA removal
efficiency increased with a current density, which could be explained
by the fact that higher current density promoted the reaction of oxygen
evolution.37 Like the applied voltage,
too high current density is not advisable for BPA degradation considering
energy consumption.

2.4.7 BPA Degradation Analysis
As for
the oxidation mechanism of organic matter, electrocatalytic oxidation
can be classified into direct oxidation and indirect oxidation. In
the direct electrochemical oxidation process, contaminants are adsorbed
to the surface of the anode and then destroyed and removed by the
anodic electron transfer reaction. The oxidation reaction process
of organic matter on the anode is as follows 2   3   4   5  

Obviously, there are two kinds of active
oxygen in the state of adsorbed ·OH and high-valence oxide in
the crystal lattice. To increase the electrochemical incineration
activity, a high concentration of active adsorption sites is required
on the surface of the electrode, and the concentration of adsorbed
hydroxyl radicals is sufficiently high.

Indirect electrochemical
oxidation is a method that utilizes strong
oxidants to degrade pollutants during electrochemical reactions, which
produces superoxide-free radicals such as O2·, H2O2, HO·, and other active groups to oxidize
organic matter in water through the action of electrodes and catalytic
materials. The surface of electrode adsorbs a large amount of hydroxyl
radicals, and chemical reaction can be performed as follows: 6   7   8  

According to the
relevant literature,38 BPA is removed via
the synergistic action of direct and indirect
electrocatalytic oxidation pathways. In the direct oxidation process,
BPA is adsorbed on the surface of the electrode, and the electrons
are directly oxidatively degraded by the electrode catalysis, and
the indirect oxidative degradation of BPA was carried out by the formation
of HO· and other oxidation intermediates during the electrolysis
process.

When the electrolyte was 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution,
applied voltage was 5 V, the electrode distance was 3 cm, BPA initial
concentration was 20 mg/L, and BPA concentration was analyzed by HPLC.
After 180 min, the presence of BPA was not detected in the solution,
indicating that BPA had been degraded and converted to other substances.
The product from degradation of BPA was studied by LC/MS, the results
show the presence of benzoquinone and some small linear organic compounds.
Therefore, it was confirmed that the Ti/PbO2 electrode
was effective for BPA degradation and the general pathway11,38 of BPA degradation can be explained as shown below (Figure 7):

Figure 7 Reaction pathway for electrochemical degradation
of BPA.

3 Conclusions
The Ti/PbO2(F) and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrodes
were prepared successfully with electrochemical deposition. It shows
that adding SDS in electroplating bath can form a more compact, uniform,
and smooth film of the Ti/PbO2 electrode whose particle
size becomes smaller. Hence, it can be obtained that the morphology
and crystallization could be changed by adding SDS and different contents
of Nafion, and it could reduce the corroded crystal faces and surface
defects.

The OEP of the dimensional stable electrode modified
by SDS is
higher than that of the Ti/PbO2(F) electrode. The existence
of F and SDS could increase the OEP of Ti/PbO2 inhibiting
the oxygen evolution reaction to improve the stability of electrodes
effectively, which reduces the process of oxygen evolution resulting
in prolonging the service life according to electrode accelerated
lifetime test, and the service life of Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode
is about 1.6 times longer than Ti/PbO2(F) electrode. Pb
concentrations in electrolytic solution were measured by ICP, which
decreased 15.1% for Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrode, and it indicates
that the reducing of Pb ions shows the excellent corrosion resistance
electrodes causing low environmental risks.

When the electrolyte
was 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution,
applied voltage was 5 V, the electrode distance was 3 cm, BPA initial
concentration was 20 mg/L, BPA removal efficiency for 180 min can
reach up to 100 and 97.6% for Ti/PbO2(F) and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrodes, respectively. Consequently, the dimensional
stable electrode modified by SDS has a longer service life and lower
environmental risks, simultaneously, which also guarantees efficient
removal of bisphenol A.

The titanium plate was pretreated following
these steps. First, the
titanium substrate was cut into such a size that was 3 cm × 1
cm × 0.1 cm and cleaned thoroughly with deionized water. Then,
it was heated with 1.0 mol/L of NaOH at 90 °C for 30 min to remove
surface oil and boiled with 10% oxalic acid for 2 h. Afterward, the
titanium plate was rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for 2–3
times. Finally, the cleaned Ti plate was stored in ethanol solution.

4.2.2 Preparation of Sb–SnO2 Film
The Sb–SnO2 film was prepared by
thermal decomposition.20 The polymer precursor
solution was uniformly coated on the two sides of the titanium plate
with a brush. The titanium plate was dried in an electric blast drying
oven at 130 °C for 10 min, then it was placed in a box-type resistance
furnace at 500 °C for 15 min, and after little cooling, the surface
ash was blown off and the next coating was carried out. The modification
procedure was repeated 10 times, the last firing time was extended
to 1 h, and the sample was cooled with the furnace thereby producing
a Sb–SnO2 film layer.

4.2.3 Preparation
of Ti/PbO2 Electrode
In this study, the Ti/PbO2 electrodes were prepared
by electrochemical deposition in two kinds of electrodeposition solutions.
The Ti plate covered with Sb–SnO2 film was inserted
into the electrodeposition solution containing 0.5 mol/L of Pb(NO3)2, 0.1 mol/L of Cu(NO3)2, 0.1 mol/L of HNO3, and 10 μL of 5% Nafion. The
electrochemical deposition of PbO2 was accomplished under
current density 80 mA/cm2 for 30 min and then 60 mA/cm2 for 30 min at 60 °C. In this way, we can get the Ti/PbO2(F) electrode. And by adding 30 μL of 5% Nafion and
0.05 g of SDS to the deposition solution, the Ti/PbO2(F+SDS)
electrode was prepared.

More details for a selection of the
applied solution compositions and electrolysis conditions for preparation
of the PbO2 anode are presented in the Supporting Information
(Scheme S1). And the current efficiency
of PbO2 during the deposition process are shown in the
Supporting Information (Table S2).

4.3 Electrode Accelerated Life Test
The
accelerated life test was a fast method to investigate electrode stability.
The tested electrode was anode and titanium plate was used as cathode,
which was performed at 1 A cm2 in 2 mol/L of H2SO4 solution at 60 °C. The anode potential was monitored
and recorded periodically, and it is generally considered that the
electrode was deactivated until the electrode potential increased
to 5 V from its initial voltage.39

4.4 Degradation of BPA
The degradation
of BPA was carried out in an electrolytic cell with electrolyte solution
volume of 100 mL. The prepared Ti/PbO2(F) and Ti/PbO2(F+SDS) electrodes were anodes and the cathode was stainless
steel mesh. The degrading solution consists of certain concentrations
of BPA solution and electrolyte solution. Under the condition of stirring
rate of 250 rpm, various factors including electrolyte, electrolyte
concentration, initial concentration of BPA, electrode distance, applied
voltage, and current density were studied. The experiments lasted
for 3 h by the state of direct current (DC) and the samples were taken
at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min. BPA concentration
was analyzed by HPLC and can be calculated from the peak area that
is proportional to the BPA concentration.
