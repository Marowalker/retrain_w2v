Introducing magnetic
behavior in nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides
is essential to broaden their applications in spintronic and nanomagnetic
devices. In this article, we investigate the electronic and magnetic
properties of transition-metal-intercalated tungsten diselenide (WSe2) using density functional theory. We find that intercalation
compounds with composition of T1/4WSe2 (T is an iron-series transition-metal
atom) exhibit substantial magnetic moments and pronounced ferromagnetic
order for late transition metals. The densities of states of the T
atoms and the magnetic moments on the W sites indicate that the moments
of the intercalated atoms become more localized with increasing atomic
number. A large perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy of about
9 meV per supercell has been found for Fe1/4WSe2. Furthermore, using mean field theory, we estimated high Curie temperatures
of 660, 475, and 379 K for Cr, Mn, and Fe, respectively. The predicted
magnetic properties suggest that WSe2 may have applications
in spin electronics and nanomagnetic devices.

1 Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) have attracted much attention
due to their intriguing physical and chemical properties, which stimulate
intense research from both fundamental and technological viewpoints.
The technological aspect includes applications in various fields,
such as electronics, catalysis, photonics, and energy storage.1−5 TMDs are quasi two-dimensional (2D) structures formed by stacking
of MX2 trilayers (M = transition metal, X = S, Se, Te)
that are coupled by van der Waals (vdW) forces. However, the nonmagnetic
nature of most TMDs prevents their applications in spin-electronic
devices. Various approaches have been developed to induce and manipulate
the magnetism in these materials, such as through point defects,6,7 doping,7−10 ion intercalation,11−13 and strain.14−17 Among these approaches, intercalation of foreign
magnetic atoms is of significant interest as the atoms can be stored
in the space between the TMD layers. The systems synthesized this
way provide a unique opportunity to tuning their magnetic properties
depending upon the nature and concentration of the intercalates.

Various spin structures are encountered in these magnetic intercalation
compounds. For example, M1/3NbS2 is antiferromagnetic
(AFM) with intercalated Fe, Co, and Ni atoms,18 whereas M1/3TaS2 is ferromagnetic (FM) with
a small Curie temperature.19 Spintronic
applications normally require large easy-axis magnetocrystalline anisotropy
(K1 > 0). Very recently, Ko et al.13 observed a large unquenched orbital moment of
1 μB for Fe intercalates and a huge magnetocrystalline
anisotropy of 15 meV per supercell in Fe1/4TaS2. Later, giant magnetoresistance and coercivity were observed in
this system.20,21 Mn-intercalated TaS2 has also been found to be magnetic but with easy-plane anisotropy
(K1 < 0).22

The high anisotropy of Fe1/4TaS2 is
a spin–orbit
coupling (SOC) effect linked to the unquenched orbital moment.13 In second-order perturbation theory, the anisotropy
is proportional to ξΔμL, where ξ
is the spin–orbit coupling constant and ΔμL is the change in orbital moment during spin rotation.23,24 The SOC is particularly large in heavy elements, about 300 meV in
the middle of the Pt (5d) series. The question therefore arises whether
similar effects are caused by intercalated iron-series (3d) transition-metal
atoms in other TMDs containing heavy elements. Among other TMDs, WSe2 is another potential candidate, which exhibits pronounced
spin–orbit effects in the absence of intercalated atoms.25,26 Intercalation of alkaline and transition-metal atoms in WSe2 has been investigated in the context of structural, electrical,
optical, and photovoltaic applications.27−31 However, magnetic properties of WSe2 intercalated
with 3d transition-metal elements are still under investigation and
vital for future spintronic devices.

In this article, we investigate
the magnetism of WSe2 intercalated with transition-metal
atoms. A comprehensive density-functional
analysis of energetics and electronic and magnetic properties of series
T1/4WSe2 has been performed, where T is the
iron-series (3d) transition metal ranging from Sc to Ni. Depending
on the intercalated transition-metal atom, the interaction between
neighboring T atoms is ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM).
In particular, we find AFM order in WSe2 for Ti and V intercalate
atoms. For Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co, we find FM order and a large magnetic
anisotropy for Mn and Fe intercalation.

2 Results
and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1, the stoichiometry of the (1/4)T atom per
WSe2 formula
unit can be realized using a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell, and the
intercalated atoms are accommodated in the van der Waals gaps of the
two layers of WSe2. As a result of intercalation, the intermolecular
forces between the neighboring TMD layers are expected to change from
vdW to ionic, metallic, or covalent with the intercalate atom mediating
the interaction.32,33 Therefore, the results for transition-metal-intercalated
WSe2 are calculated without dispersion correction. There
are more than one possibilities of realizing the T1/4WSe2 chemical composition in the supercell, and we chose the one
having the lowest energy. Figure 1 shows the corresponding arrangement of the atoms in
the [T1/4WSe2]8 supercell. Each supercell
contains eight formula units and therefore two T atoms.

Figure 1 Structure of
3d-metal-intercalated WSe2: (a) supercell
of [T1/4WSe2]8 and (b) indexed W
layers in the supercell. The blue, green, and yellow spheres represent
T (Sc to Ni), W, and Se atoms, respectively.

Table 1 shows
the
optimized lattice parameters for [WSe2]8 intercalated
with 3d transition-metal atoms. From the table, we see that the intercalation
increases the lattice constant, c, by up to 12%,
whereas the effect on a is insignificant (a maximum
change of 2.5%). The lattice expansion in the c-direction
reflects an increase in the W–Se bond length, which is a consequence
of the large size of the intercalated atoms and of the charge transfer
to the W and Se atoms. In more detail, WSe2 layers interact
via van der Waals forces, but this interaction changes to metallic
upon intercalation. Furthermore, the intercalate atoms move toward
neighboring W atoms. As a result, one layer of WSe2 induces
more polarization than that from the other. The corresponding in-plane
atomic displacement is 3–5% for W (W1 and W4) atoms near the intercalate atoms, whereas this displacement
is less than 2.5% for other atoms. Table 1 shows the corresponding charge transfers
from the T intercalates to neighboring W and Se atoms. Furthermore,
the charge transfer calculated using Bader charge analysis34 shows that the guest atoms act as mediators
for the interaction between the negatively charged WSe2 layers.

To verify the feasibility
of intercalation in WSe2,
we calculated the energy for inserting transition-metal atoms into
WSe2 using the following equation 1  where the energies refer to one supercell,
that is, to two T atoms, and last term E(T) corresponds
to the total energy of an isolated T atom, which is computed by placing
a T atom in a large supercell. The computed intercalation energies
are tabulated in Table 1. From the table, we can infer that intercalation in WSe2 is energetically favorable. This means that the T atoms remain captured
between the dichalcogenide layers, rather than diffusing between the
layers and recombining to yield precipitates of elemental metals.5 In other words, intercalated compounds are more
robust than atoms or molecules adsorbed on surfaces because of the
thick and chemically inert TMD sheets surrounding the intercalate
atoms.

Figure 2a,b shows
the total spin magnetic moment (μtot) and the spin
moment per intercalated atom (μT) of ferromagnetic
T1/4WSe2, respectively, as a function of atomic
number with and without including Hubbard terms U = 3 and 7 eV and J = 1 eV. The exact value of U is unknown but probably close to 3 eV, and the blue and
green lines in Figure 2 indicate that U has a rather small effect on the
magnetic moment. The total spin moments per supercell shown in Figure 2a slightly differ
from twice of the transition-metal moment shown in Figure 2b. These differences arise
due to the hybridization of iron-series 3d and W 5d moments, which
partially spin-polarizes the neighboring W atoms. In the case of Ti,
V, and Cr guest atoms, the total spin moment is larger than 2μT, which indicates parallel spin alignment between neighboring
transition-metal and W atoms, whereas for intercalated Mn, Fe, and
Co atoms, the total moment is reduced due to antiparallel spin alignment
with neighboring W atoms.

Figure 2 Spin magnetic moments as a function of transition-metal
atom T
in [T1/4WSe2]8: (a) moment per unit
cell and (b) moment on each T atom. The calculations have all been
done for U = 0.0, 3.0, and 7.0 eV, without spin–orbit
interaction and with ferromagnetic T–T exchange.

To gain quantum-mechanical insight into the nature
of magnetism
in intercalated WSe2 systems, we plot the densities of
states (DOSs) of intercalates, as shown in Figure 3. The Se atoms surrounding the T atom form
a nearly distorted octahedron, due to which the 3d orbitals of T atoms
split up into three levels, namely, (i) dz2, (ii) dxy, dx2–y2, and (iii) dxz, dyz, which are broadened by interatomic hopping. The
d bands of intercalated atoms shown in Figure 3 lie in the band gap of the host material.
The DOSs for Sc and Ni have not been shown here because Sc and Ni
do not induce any magnetism. In case of Ti and V intercalates, the
bands are delocalized and hybridized with neighboring W and Se atoms,
resulting in a small ferromagnetic polarization in W, as shown in Figure 3a–d. The bands
of Cr, on the other hand, are localized, as shown in Figure 3e. From Figure 3e, we find that the majority states of Cr
are mostly filled, whereas minority states are empty. This produces
a high magnetic moment in the Cr atoms. Note that the majority states
of Ti, V, and Cr lie within the band gap of WSe2, which
produces a magnetic behavior in Ti1/4WSe2 and
V1/4WSe2.

Figure 3 (a–l) Orbital-projected ferromagnetic
partial density of
states (DOS) of 3d metal atoms in [T1/4WSe2]8 at U = 0 eV (left panel) and U = 3 eV (right panel). The Fermi levels are shown by vertical dashed
lines.

Figure 3g,i shows
that the majority states of Mn and Fe are mostly filled, whereas the
minority states are partially empty, which leads to large magnetic
moments in Mn1/4WSe2. In case of Mn intercalation,
the three sets of states dz2, (dx2–y2/dxy), and (dyz/dzx) are empty, as
shown in Figure 3g,
whereas for the Fe intercalate, as shown in Figure 3i, the dx2–y2/dxy and dyz/dzx levels are partially occupied.

Inclusion
of Hubbard interaction parameter U for
this case pushes the states away from the Fermi level, as shown in Figure 3h,j, which increases
the magnetic moment of Mn and Fe intercalates. For Co intercalation,
the majority and minority states are mostly occupied, partially empty
majority dz2 states, which
yields a small magnetic moment in the Co intercalate. The inclusion
of U somewhat increases the number of unoccupied
minority states. Note that U is not exactly known
for the present intercalates, and its accurate calculation goes beyond
the scope of this article. The inclusion of U has
some effect on the magnetic moment but leaves the overall picture
unchanged.

Table 2 lists the
spin moments on the tungsten atoms. This relatively small moment,
induced through interatomic hybridization by the iron-series atoms,
is most pronounced for Ti and V but virtually negligible for Mn and
Fe. This finding indicates that the magnetism of Ti1/4WSe2 and V1/4WSe2 is largely itinerant,
the magnetic moment being delocalized all over the unit cell. By comparison,
the moments of Mn1/4WSe2, Fe1/4WSe2, and Fe1/4WSe2 are more localized on
the Mn and Fe sites, which limits the degree of 3d–5d hybridization
and the corresponding induced W moment. The same conclusion can be
drawn from the densities of states of Figure 3. As the atomic number of the T atoms increases,
the 3d band narrows because the effective nuclear charge acting on
the T atoms becomes larger toward the end of the iron series. This
leads to a reduced interatomic hybridization, to narrower bands, and
to reduced W moments.

To study the magnetic order in T1/4WSe2,
we compared the total energies of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic
(FM) spin configurations. The AFM configuration is obtained by flipping
one of the T spins in the supercell, similar to previous approximate
calculations of exchange constants.35,36 The AFM configuration
chosen in this article is therefore the one in which neighboring T
layers along the z-direction are aligned antiparallel
and corresponds to minimum energy among different AFM configurations. Figure 4 shows the energy
difference (ΔEJ = EAFM – EFM) between
the FM and AFM states across the iron series without SOC (red curve),
whereas ΔEK is the corresponding
SOC correction (dashed blue). The Sc and Ni intercalates are nonmagnetic,
which implies that there is no magnetic order. For Ti and V intercalates,
we predict AFM order, whereas for Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co, we find FM order.
The respective T moments in the AFM configurations, namely, 1.46,
2.70, 3.82, 3.74, 2.44, and 0.81 μB, for Ti, V, Cr,
Mn, Fe, and Co, are similar to the FM moments discussed above. This
indicates that the system is somewhat anisotropic but otherwise nearly
Heisenberg magnet, with moments nearly independent of the angle between
neighboring spins.

Figure 4 ΔE in [T1/4WSe2]8. The solid (red) lines represent ΔE without SOC (ΔEJ), and the dashed (blue) lines represent the anisotropic contribution
to ΔE due to SOC (ΔEK). Here, ΔEi = EiAFM – EiFM, where (i = J and K).

The calculated ΔE in the absence of
SOC
for Cr, Mn, and Fe intercalates in WSe2 are 85.3, 61.3,
and 49.0 meV, whereas the total ΔE for Cr,
Mn, and Fe after including SOC are 86.4, 62.7, and 38.2 meV, respectively.
From these values, we infer that the anisotropic spin–orbit
coupling effect is relativistically small and normally a minor correction
to the leading isotropic Heisenberg exchange through WSe2 layers. However, it becomes more important if the isotropic Heisenberg
exchange is small by coincidence, for example in the vicinity of an
FM–AFM transition. Figure 4 shows this case for the early transition metals (Sc,
Ti, and V) in T1/4WSe2. Furthermore, to check
the robustness of the magnetic order with respect to correlations,
we performed DFT + U calculations for two different
values of U. We find that U does
not affect the magnetic order in these systems.

It is interesting
to evaluate the magnetic ordering temperature,
that is, the Curie temperature (TC) in
the ferromagnetic case. We use mean-field expression 2  where the energy difference refers to the
switching of one T spin per supercell, as shown in Figure 4. We estimate TC values of 660, 475, 379, and 189 K for Cr, Mn, Fe, and
Co, respectively. The values for Cr, Mn, and Co may be useful for
devices that operate at room temperature.37,38

Apart from yielding a correction to the energy of FM and AFM
states,
the SOC is responsible for the orbital moment contribution to the
total magnetic moment and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The anisotropy
energy, EMCA, is obtained as 3  where Ex and Ez are the
respective self-consistent total DFT energies when the magnetization
is in the film plane (Ex) and parallel to the c- or z-direction
perpendicular to the film (Ez).39 To calculate the AFM anisotropy energy, the
spins of the two T atoms in the supercell are aligned antiparallel
to each other.

Figure 5 shows the
orbital moment and the anisotropy energy in their minimum-energy spin
structures, using U = 0. The orbital moment on the
W atoms is very small and therefore not shown. Note that W has a relatively
strong spin–orbit coupling, but the net orbital moment of the
W atoms is proportional to the induced W spin moment and therefore
strongly reduced. For Ti, V, Cr, and Mn intercalates, the orbital
moments are small, in the range of 0.1–0.25 μB per supercell. Figure 5a shows the plot of total orbital moment of the system along the x- and z-direction. Ti- and V-intercalated
WSe2 exhibit AFM order structure, as discussed above in Figure 4, which results in
zero total orbital moment. In case of Cr and Mn, the orbital moment
is largest in the WSe2 plane and the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy is of the easy-plane type (K1 < 0), whereas for Ti, V, Mn, Fe, and Co intercalates, the total
orbital moment is largest in the plane perpendicular to the WSe2 plane, which suggests an out-of-plane anisotropy. Among the
iron-series intercalates, a significantly large perpendicular orbital
moment of 0.55 μB has been found for the Fe intercalate,
and the resulting orbital moment anisotropy of 0.2 μB (Figure 5a) indicates
strong perpendicular anisotropy. Indeed, Figure 5b shows that Fe1/4WSe2 exhibits a large anisotropy constant of 9.0 meV per supercell.

directions and (b) magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE or EMCA) ∼ K1, measured in meV per supercell.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated
the effect of 3d metal atom intercalation
on the electronic and magnetic properties of WSe2. The
spin structure depends on the intercalated transition-metal atom and
changes from antiferromagnetism at the beginning of the series to
strong ferromagnetism for the later transition metals. The high moments
are also accompanied by high Curie temperatures. Iron intercalation
yields a strong perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 9.0
meV per supercell. Our calculations indicate that Ti and V create
delocalized antiferromagnetism, whereas Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co exhibit
localized ferromagnetism in WSe2. The magnetic moment,
the high Curie temperatures, and the high magnetic anisotropy suggest
that these late iron-series transition-metal atoms intercalated in
WSe2 may have potential applications in spin electronics
and quantum-information devices.

4 Computational
Details
The first-principles calculations were carried out
within the framework
of density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna ab
initio simulation package.40,41 Within the generalized
gradient approximation, we use projector augmented wave pseudopotentials
with exchange and correlation effects described by the Perdew–Burke
and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.42 To accurately
describe the wave functions, a plane-wave cutoff of 520 eV is used.
To account for the dispersion interactions of van der Waals in layered
compounds, we optimized the lattice parameters of pure WSe2 using the semiempirical London dispersion correction of Grimme et
al.43 Considering this correction, the
optimized lattice parameters of pure WSe2 are found to
be a = b = 3.29 Å and c = 13.023 Å, which agree fairly well with earlier
findings.44,45 For WSe2, we find a band gap
of 1.02 eV, which is comparable to the existing literature.46

The lattice parameters and atomic positions
are fully optimized
using a Γ-centered k-mesh of size 7 ×
7 × 5 until the forces on each of the atoms are below 2.0 meV/Å.
For the self-consistent field calculations, a mesh of size 13 ×
13 × 7 is used with an energy convergence threshold of 10–6 eV. A DFT + U scheme is employed
to estimate the electron correlations of the iron-series 3d electrons,
using U = 3 and 7 eV and J = 1 eV
in addition to the uncorrelated case (U = 0).

To calculate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the spin–orbit
coupling (SOC) is included in a noncollinear mode,47,48 using an energy convergence threshold of 1 μeV and a Γ-centered k-mesh of 15 × 15 × 9 to sample the Brillouin
zone of the system.49
