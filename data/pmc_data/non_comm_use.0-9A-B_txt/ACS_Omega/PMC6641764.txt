1,8-Naphthalenediol
(dihydroxynaphthalene, 1,8-DHN) has been shown
to be a potent hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) antioxidant compound because
of the strong stabilization of the resulting free radical by intramolecular
hydrogen bonding. However, the properties, reactivity, and fate of
the 1,8-DHN phenoxyl radical have remained so far uncharted. Herein,
we report an integrated experimental and computational characterization
of the early intermediates and dimer products that arise by the oxidation
of 1,8-DHN. Laser flash photolysis (LFP) studies of HAT from 1,8-DHN
to the cumyloxyl and aminoxyl radicals showed the generation of a
transient species absorbing at 350, 400, and >600 nm attributable
to the 1,8-DHN phenoxyl radical. Peroxidase/H2O2 oxidation of 1,8-DHN was found to proceed via an intense blue intermediate
(λmax 654 nm) preceding precipitation of a black
melanin-like polymer. By halting the reaction in the early stages,
three main dimers featuring 2,2′-, 2,4′-, and 4,4′-bondings
could be isolated and characterized in pure form. Density functional
theory calculations supported the generation of the 1,8-DHN phenoxyl
radical and its subsequent coupling via the 2- and 4-positions giving
extended quinone dimers with intense transitions in the visible range,
consistent with UV–vis and LFP data. Overall, these results
allowed to elucidate the mechanism of oxidative polymerization of
1,8-DHN of possible relevance to melanogenesis in fungi and other
processes of environmental and astrochemical relevance.

Introduction
1,8-Naphthalenediol
or dihydroxynaphthalene (1,8-DHN) is a naturally
occurring polyketide derivative involved in the biosynthesis of black
melanin polymers implicated in virulence, resistance to environmental
stress, and protection against oxidative stress and harmful radiations
in several fungi species.1−4 1,8-DHN is also a possible component of the polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) derivatives that may be generated during
combustion and other processes of high environmental impact that may
contribute to pollution via polymerization mechanisms.5,6 In addition, 1,8-DHN and other hydroxylated PAH derivatives can
be generated by the exposure of naphthalene to ultraviolet radiation
in astrophysical ice analogs, allowing specific prediction of the
existence and possible roles of various oxidized naphthalenes in planetary
environments of possible prebiotic relevance.7−12

Previous studies indicated that 1,8-DHN is a highly efficient
antioxidant,
as denoted by potent hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) properties determined
by the 2,2-di(4-octylphenyl)-1-picrylhydrazyl radical and the azobisisobutyronitrile-initiated
styrene autoxidation assays.13 The antioxidant
behavior was attributed to (a) the large stabilizing effect of the
resulting aryloxyl radical by intramolecular hydrogen bonding and
(b) the additional stabilization of the H-bonded intermediate by the
naphthalene ring system. Both kinetic experiments and theoretical
calculations of the O–H bond dissociation enthalpies revealed
the more effective antioxidant power exhibited by 1,8-DHN with respect
to the parent phenolic and/or catecholic compounds.14−17 Possible exploitation as an antioxidant
was moreover suggested by its inability to form a quinone because
of the meta-like peri dioxygenation pattern, making its oxidation
products expectedly less toxic. Although the HAT process from 1,8-DHN
has been extensively investigated, little information is currently
available about the properties and chemical fate of the resulting
H-bonded radical. In this connection, a systematic mass spectrometric
investigation of the biomimetic polymerization of 1,8-DHN with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)/H2O2 or laccase in phosphate
buffer at pH 7 showed in both cases C–C coupling of the naphthalene
rings as the dominant mode of coupling.18 However, the properties and mode of coupling of the H-bonded phenoxyl
radical, the nature of the main oligomer intermediates, and the mechanism
of the polymerization process beyond the dimer level remained virtually
unexplored.

Herein, we report a combined experimental and theoretical
investigation
aimed at characterizing by laser flash photolysis (LFP) the early
transient species produced by the oxidation of 1,8-DHN and monitoring
their conversion into isolable oligomer intermediates. Specific aims
of the study were as follows: (a) to probe the kinetics and the course
of HAT processes from 1,8-DHN by an approach complementary to those
reported in the literature and to characterize the resulting free-radical
species; (b) to identify the main chromophoric species produced in
the process; and (c) to assess the mode of coupling of H-bonded phenoxyl
radicals via isolation and characterization of dimer intermediates.
Both transient product identification and mechanistic analysis were
supported by extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Results
and Discussion
LFP Experiments
The absorption properties
and kinetics
of the species produced from 1,8-DHN under HAT conditions were investigated
by the cumyloxyl radical (CumO•) and two N-oxyl radicals such as phthalimide-N-oxyl
(PINO) and benzotriazole-N-oxyl radical (BTNO) as
the abstracting species. CumO• was generated by
355 nm LFP of acetonitrile solutions containing dicumyl peroxide (Scheme 1).19

Scheme 1 Generation of the Cumyloxyl Radical by LFP and Its
Action on 1,8-DHN20
For comparative purposes, to aid in the identification
of the main
transient species and to probe the effect of intramolecular hydrogen
bonding, the same experiments were run on 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene
(1,5-DHN), which produces on oxidation a quinone-type intermediate,
and on 1-naphthol, which bears a single OH group. Figure 1 shows the spectral changes
observed following 355 nm LFP of an acetonitrile solution containing
dicumyl peroxide and 1,8-DHN (1), 1,5-DHN (2), or 1-naphthol (3).

Figure 1 Time-resolved absorption spectra observed
after 355 nm LFP of an
argon-saturated MeCN solution (T = 25 °C) containing
dicumyl peroxide (1.0 M) and 1,8-DHN (3.0 mM) (1), 1,5-DHN
(4.9 mM) (2), or 1-naphthol (7.7 mM) (3)
recorded at various time after the 8 ns, 10 mJ laser pulse. Insets:
(a) Decay of the cumyloxyl radical monitored at 490 nm and (b) buildup
and subsequent decay of absorption monitored at various wavelengths.

In the case of 1,8-DHN, the decay
of CumO• monitored
at 490 nm was accompanied by the buildup of a transient species characterized
by three absorption bands centered at 350, 400, and >660 nm, which
can be assigned to the 8-hydroxy-1-naphthoxyl radical produced by
HAT. Comparative inspection of the traces obtained from 1,5-DHN and
1-naphthol as reference substrates under the same conditions showed
a markedly different profile only in the case of 1-naphthol.21 This observation indicated that the contribution
of the second OH group on the adjacent ring was more important than
intramolecular H-bonding in determining the free-radical absorption
properties.

The second-order rate constants (kH) for the reaction of CumO• with these
substrates
were obtained from the slope of the observed rate constant (kobs) versus [substrate] plots, where in turn,
the kobs values were measured following
the buildup of the naphthoxyl radical absorption band at the different
substrate concentrations. The kH values
thus obtained show an almost threefold increase on going from mono
to dihydroxynaphthalenes, with 1,8-DHN giving higher values than 1,5-DHN,
confirming previously reported stabilizing effect of H-bonding exerted
by the peri OH group (Table 1).

HAT from 1,8-DHN was also investigated on the longer
millisecond
scale using two aminoxyl radicals, PINO and BTNO, which are significantly
less reactive than CumO• as hydrogen atom abstractors.
In the LFP experiments, PINO and BTNO were produced by HAT from N-hydroxyphthalimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) to
CumO• (Scheme 2), respectively, which in turn was generated as described
above.22−26

Scheme 2 Generation of PINO and BTNO by LFP and Their Action on 1,8-DHN
Figure 2 shows the
time-resolved absorption spectra observed after 355 nm LFP of an argon-saturated
MeCN solution containing dicumyl peroxide (1.0 M), HBT (9.2 mM), and
1,8-DHN (0.57 mM).

Figure 2 Time-resolved absorption spectra observed after 355 nm
LFP of an
argon-saturated MeCN solution (T = 25 °C) containing
dicumyl peroxide (1.0 M), HBT (9.2 mM), and 1,8-DHN (0.57 mM) recorded
at 127 μs (black circles), 703 μs (white circles), 3.5
ms (red circles), and 10 ms (green circles) after the 8 ns, 10 mJ
laser pulse. Insets: Buildup of absorption monitored at 370 nm; buildup
and subsequent decay of absorption monitored at 400 nm; and decay
of absorption monitored at 480 nm.

The decay of the BTNO radical followed at the maximum absorption
wavelength (480 nm)27 occurs on the millisecond
timescale and is accompanied by the formation of a species characterized
by an absorption maximum around 370 nm that does not decay in this
time regime. Because the lifetime of the naphthoxyl radical formed
following HAT from 1,8-DHN was too short to allow its detection on
this timescale (Figure 1(1), inset b), the species absorbing at 370 nm was tentatively assigned
to a coupling product derived from dimerization of the 1,8-DHN phenoxyl
radical. Support to this hypothesis was provided by the observation
of a similar spectrum, characterized by an absorption band centered
at 370 nm, when the reaction of CumO• with 1,8-DHN
was analyzed 1 ms after the laser pulse, that is, at a significantly
longer time delay as compared to those of the spectra displayed in Figure 1 (see Figures S10 and S11).

Using an excess of
the substrate under pseudo-first-order conditions,
the observed rate constants (kobs) were
measured following the decay of PINO or BTNO at their maximum absorption
wavelengths (380 and 480 nm, respectively).27,28 From the slope of the kobs versus [substrate]
plots, the kH values for HAT from 1-naphthol,
1,5-DHN, and 1,8-DHN to PINO and BTNO were determined. The rate constants
thus obtained are collected in Table 2. kH values are in line
with those determined in a previous study for HAT from activated phenolic
systems.29,30

1,5-DHN	2.9 ± 0.2 × 105	2.60 ± 0.1 × 105	
As observed for HAT promoted by CumO•, the measured kH values increased on
going from mono to dihydroxynaphthalenes,
with 1,5-DHN proving less reactive than 1,8-DHN. However, significantly
larger differences were observed for the N-oxyl radicals as compared
to CumO• [kH(1,8-DHN)/kH(1-naphthol) = 21.8, 14.6, and 2.7 for PINO,
BTNO, and CumO•, respectively], a behavior that
reasonably reflects the lower intrinsic reactivity of the former radicals
as compared to the latter one.

Some of the putative species
accounting for the dynamic absorption
measurements in Figures 1 and 2 with relevant absorption maximum are
indicated below in Scheme 3.

Oxidation Chemistry of
1,8-DHN: Isolation and Characterization
of Oligomeric Intermediates
In subsequent experiments, 1,8-DHN
was oxidized with the HRP/H2O2 system in phosphate
buffer at pH 7,18 and the course of the
reaction was investigated by spectrophotometric analysis.

Data
in Figure 3 show the
rapid development of a visible absorbing species with a maximum at
654 nm and a shoulder at 583 accounting for an intense greenish-blue
coloration persisting over 40 min.

the same time. Time evolution monitored at 583 and 654 nm (b).

By halting the reaction via addition
of sodium dithionite, followed
by extraction with ethyl acetate and acetylation of the extractable
fraction, it was possible to obtain, after a first chromatographic
step, a mixture of dimeric products, as supported by ultraperformance
liquid chromatography (UPLC)–electrospray ionization (ESI)–mass
spectrometry (MS) and NMR evidence (Figure 4). Inspection of the two-dimensional (2D)
NMR spectra of the whole fraction allowed the identification of a
set of resonances ascribable to the unsubstituted portion of the naphthalene
ring (double doublets around δ 7.9 and 7.2 and triplets at δ
7.5–7.6) along with sets of doublets attributable to monosubstituted
aromatic rings (Figure S9). These assignments
were supported by the analysis of the 1H,13C
heteronuclear single-quantum coherence and 1H,13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectra of the same fraction.
By repeated chromatographic steps, three main products were isolated
in pure form and identified by mono and bidimensional NMR analysis
and by MS (Figures S1–S8) as the
2,2′-, 2,4′-, and 4,4′-dimers (Figure 4).

Mechanistic Issues and DFT Calculations
On the basis
of spectrophotometric, LFP, and product isolation experiments, a number
of important issues arose concerning: (1) the actual identification
of the first formed species as the phenoxyl radicals; (2) the nature
of the species responsible for the persistent blue-green coloration
from 1,8-DHN; and (3) the prevalent mode of coupling of the free radical
from 1,8-DHN because the observed order of isolated yields could not
be related in a straightforward manner to the regioselectivity of
the initial free-radical coupling. In addition, it was of interest
to understand the dominant mechanism of oligomer chain growth following
the dimer stage to predict the nature of main oligomer building blocks
in the final melanin-like polymer. To address these issues, a detailed
computational investigation of the structural and spectroscopic properties
of the main oxidation products of 1,8-DHN was carried out at the DFT
level of theory to address mechanistic issues and to corroborate the
main structural conclusions from the preceding experiments.

All structures were geometry-optimized at the DFT level, with a hybrid
functional (PBE0)31 and a reasonably large
basis set [6-31+G(d,p)]. For each species, different tautomers/conformers,
as well as different protonation states were explored. Computations
were performed either in vacuo or by adoption of a polarizable continuum
medium (PCM)32−35 to account for the influence of the solution environment. Nonelectrostatic
contributions to the solvation free energy were accounted for in single-point
PCM calculations employing radii and nonelectrostatic terms of the
SMD solvation model.36 Vibrational–rotational
contributions to the free energy were also computed.

The issue
of the regiochemistry of the initial coupling step was
addressed by investigating the properties of the first-formed radical.
A description of the most stable form of the 1,8-DHN free radical
[(8-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)oxidanyl] and its anion, including structural
parameters, spin density, singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO),
and main electronic transitions with relevant oscillator strengths37−41 is given in Table 3. The simulated absorption spectrum is given in Figure 5.

> 300 nm, f > 0.05) electronic transitions
(TD-PBE0/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM).

Inspection of the simulated spectra for the radical revealed distinct
maxima predicted at ca. 320 and 670 nm. These spectra matched fairly
well with the trace of the developing species in the LFP experiment
attributed to the initially formed free radical. The regioselectivity
issue posed by the radical coupling step was then investigated by
comparing the relative stability of the early coupling products prior
to aromatization. The underlying assumption was that the free-radical
dimerization step is under kinetic control and obeys to the Bell–Evans–Polanyi
principle, whereby dimer product distribution would be dictated by
the energies of the transition states mirroring the relative stability
of the isomeric 2,2′-, 2,4′-, and 4,4′-coupling
products (Scheme 3).

Table 4 reports
the energies computed for the most stable conformers of the isomeric
coupling products. It appears that the 2,2′-dimer is slightly
more stable than the 2,4′- and the 4,4′-dimers in that
order.

The simulated absorption spectra
of the coupling products are reported
in Figure 6. For all,
a similar absorption around 360 nm could be predicted. This maximum
falls close to the absorption maximum found in the LFP experiments
with the BTNO radical, thus supporting the assignment of the transient
species formed in the LFP experiment to the dimers of 1,8-DHN.

To clarify the nature of the blue chromophoric
species produced
by 1,8-DHN oxidation, the possible extended quinone forms arising
from the dimers (Scheme 4) were then investigated and compared for their energy and absorption
properties.

More interestingly, the more
favorable energetics associated with
the 2,2′ coupling mode at the dienedione level were confirmed
at the higher extended quinone-type oxidation level. Inspection of
the main electronic transitions predicted for these systems (Figure 7) revealed in all
cases a consistent band in the 600–700 nm range, the largest
bathochromic absorption being associated with the most stable 2,2′
isomer.

Figure 7 Simulated (TD-PBE0/6-311++G(2d,2p)/PCM//PBE0/6-31+G(d,p)/PCM) absorption
spectra of the most significant extended quinones.

It is thus reasonably argued that the rapidly developing
blue-green
stage of the reaction corresponds to the formation of extended quinone
forms at the dimer level.

Finally, the most viable route for
oligomer growth was preliminarily
investigated. In principle, two possible pathways for trimer formation
can be proposed, namely, (a) the generation of the radical from the
dimer followed by coupling with the monomer free radical and (b) the
nucleophilic addition of the monomer to the extended quinone of a
dimer (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Possible Oxidative Evolution of the 2,2′-Dimer of 1,8-DHN
The competition between the
two reaction pathways would then be
determined by the site of H-atom abstraction from the dimer.

Oxidation of an OH group on the same ring involved in dimerization
(Scheme 5, path b)
would lead to a highly delocalized free radical that can be converted
to the extended quinone supposedly via disproportionation or further
oxidation. Conversely, in the case of free-radical formation from
the OH group on the ring adjacent to that involved in dimerization
(Scheme 5, path a),
evolution toward the extended quinone would be precluded and free-radical
coupling is the sole viable option. Other routes not supported by
a solid literature may be envisaged, but they were not considered
for the purposes of this study.

To assess which of the two pathways
is the most likely, the relative
energies of the free radicals produced by the two competing H-atom
abstraction pathways from the representative 2,2′-dimer were
compared. The results definitively predicted path b as the most favorable,
based on the greater stability of the radical due to extended spin
delocalization. No information about the ionic or radical competing
pathways could be drawn from regiochemical considerations, both giving
in principle the same species.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, LFP and peroxidase oxidation experiments, though
related to different conditions, have provided complementary information
on the free-radical pathways of DHN oxidation. Whereas LFP yielded
insight into the early transient species produced following HAT to
the oxygen-centered radicals, the peroxidase oxidation relevant to
biological fungal pathways allowed the identification of the isolable
oligomer intermediates downstream the initial oxidation step. Altogether,
experimental and computational data demonstrated an initial free-radical
coupling pathway of 1,8-DHN followed by additional radical coupling
steps or alternative phenol-extended quinone coupling processes. The
main findings can be summarized as follows:(a) the initial event
in 1,8-DHN oxidation
is the generation of a naphthoxyl radical following HAT;

(b) isolation and spectral characterization
of a dimeric fraction from the oxidation mixture of 1,8-DHN indicated
the formation of mixtures of isomers arising from coupling through
the 2- and 4-positions;

(c) predicted energies for free-radical
coupling products support 2,2′-dimerization as the most favorable
pathway though differences from the alternative 2,4′- and 4,4′-routes
are not large enough to justify a high degree of regioselectivity,
consistent with the observed isomeric dimer composition;

(d) subsequent dimer–monomer coupling
pathways contributing to the trimer population would be predicted
to proceed via isomers in which the central unit is linked to the
other units via the same ring (see 1,8-DHN trimer b in Scheme 5) and not via both rings (see
1,8-DHN trimer a in Scheme 5) because of the greater stability and spin delocalization
associated with the related free-radical dimer precursor; and

(e) formation of extended
quinones at
each level of the oligomerization sequence may account for the blue-green
chromophoric phase of the reaction.



Further
elucidation of this chemistry may provide a useful background
to inquire into the structural basis of the peculiar redox properties
of DHN-based fungal melanin.4

Experimental
Section
LFP Experiments
LFP experiments were carried out with
an Applied Photophysics LK-60 laser kinetic spectrometer providing
8 ns pulses, using the third armonic (355 nm) of a Quantel Brilliant-B
Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. The laser energy was adjusted to ≤10
mJ/pulse by the use of an appropriate filter. A 3.5 mL Suprasil quartz
cell (10 mm × 10 mm) was used for all experiments. N2-saturated CH3CN solutions of hydroxynaphthalenes (1,8-DHN,
1-naphthol, 1,5-DHN, 1.5–14 mM) and dicumyl peroxide (1 M), N-hydroxyphthalimide (5.0 mM) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole
(9.2 mM), and naphthols (0.1–2.0 mM) were used. All experiments
were carried out at T = 25 + 0.5 °C under magnetic
stirring. Data were collected at individual wavelengths with an Agilent
Infinium oscilloscope and analyzed with the kinetic package implemented
in the instrument. Rate constants were obtained by monitoring the
change of absorbance at the maximum absorption wavelengths of the
cumyloxyl or N-oxyl radicals or of the product naphthoxyl radicals
by averaging 3–5 values. Each kinetic trace obeyed a first-order
kinetic, and second-order rate constants were obtained from the slopes
of the plots of the observed rate constants kobs versus substrate concentration.

Isolation of the Acetylated
Dimers of 1,8-DHN
The oxidation
of 1,8-DHN was carried out according to a previously reported procedure.18 In brief, a solution of 1,8-DHN (500 mg, 3.12
mmol) in acetonitrile (20 mL) was added to a 0.1 M solution of phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4 (300 mL) and treated under vigorous stirring with HRP
(15 U/mL) and hydrogen peroxide (375 μL, 1.2 molar equivalents).
The reaction mixture immediately turned into blue and after 30 s was
quenched by the addition of a saturated solution of sodium dithionite
until the mixture turned brown. After acidification with a 1 M solution
of HCl, the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic
layer was washed with a sodium chloride-saturated solution and dried
over sodium sulphate. The organic solvent was then removed under vacuum
affording a brownish precipitate that was subjected to acetylation
by treatment with acetic anhydride (1 mL) and pyridine (50 μL)
overnight. The resulting mixture was evaporated under a reduced pressure,
and the residue was subjected to preparative thin-layer chromatography
using CHCl3/MeOH 99:1 as the mobile phase to afford the
acetylated dimer fraction. This latter was subjected to further chromatographic

Scheme 1 shows the direct photolysis of dicumyl peroxide
following 355 nm laser flash photolysis. However, as suggested by
a reviewer, dicumyl peroxide sensitization by photoexcited naphthalenediol
cannot be ruled out as an additional pathway for cumyloxyl radical
generation. We thank this reviewer for drawing our attention on this
point. For a recent example of photosensitized homolysis of dicumyl
peroxide see: Walalawela N. ; Greer A.
