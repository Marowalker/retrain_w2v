A free-standing,
antibacterial hydrogel was fabricated using silver-nanoparticle-immobilized
cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and alginate. Surface hydroxyl groups
of CNFs were oxidized to carboxylate groups using (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl
(TCNF), followed by the treatment with silver nitrate solution for
surface adsorption of silver ions. In situ reduction of silver ions
to produce silver nanoparticles was performed for the silver-adsorbed
CNFs. Electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and spectroscopic analysis
revealed that higher amounts of silver nanoparticles were immobilized
on the surface of TCNF than on the surface of native CNF. Silver-nanoparticle-immobilized
TCNF was embedded in alginate gels and silver ions from the matrix
were slowly released for 7 days. Silver-nanoparticle-loaded alginate
gels showed comparable antibacterial activity to silver-ions-loaded
alginate gels, although the former showed a significantly lower cytotoxicity
against animal cells. Thus, the antibacterial gels can potentially
be applied to various skin surfaces to prevent bacterial infection
while minimizing skin damage.

==== Body
Introduction
Skin wounds are often
prone to infection and difficult to heal,
demanding appropriate treatment strategies to facilitate the process
of wound healing.1 Conventional wound dressings
include natural or synthetic bandages, cotton, and gauzes, all of
which may need long-term treatment and potentially adhere to dry-wound
surfaces.2 Hence, many studies have been
directed to identify materials that are ideal for wound dressings.
Hydrogel-based wound-dressing materials offer several advantages such
as cool sensation and moist environment, allowing gaseous exchange,
and absorption of wound exudate.3−6 The major cause of wound contamination is infection
from bacterial pathogens that may easily enter the body via the wound
and reach host tissues, leading to sepsis and death.7 The most widely used method for the treatment of bacterial
infection is antibiotic therapies.

To minimize the abuse of
broad-spectrum antibiotics, silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) with lower bacterial resistance and fewer side effects have
been widely used as topical antibacterial agents.8,9 The
mechanism of action of these nanoparticles involves damage to the
bacterial cell membrane upon conversion of Ag0 to Ag+ that occurs via binding to thiol residues present on membrane
proteins and enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species formation,10 as well as the interruption of the intercellular
metabolic pathways following Ag+ penetration into the cell.11 The toxicity of AgNPs has been recognized as
a limitation of this approach, as these particles are dispersed into
the cell upon Ag+ release. This issue may be solved with
the stabilization of AgNP to fabricate composites with various materials.12,13 Bacterial cellulose was surface-decorated with self-assembled AgNPs
to exert antibacterial activity.14 The
slow release of silver ions effectively attenuated bacterial growth
while minimizing cytotoxicity against epidermal cells. In another
study, chitosan scaffolds were loaded with AgNPs prepared in situ
to minimize host tissue damage. The released silver ions, however,
were shown to exhibit considerable cytotoxicity against fibroblasts
at higher concentrations.15 Chitosan scaffolds
were also loaded with AgNPs to reduce bacterial infection during bone
transplant operation. AgNPs effectively suppressed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus while maintaining osteogenic
proliferation.16

Cellulose nanofibers
(CNFs) have been widely studied in fields
such as electron devices,17,18 cosmetics,19 paper films,20 biomedical
devices,21 and polymer nanocomposites22,23 owing to their nontoxicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility,
and economic sustainability.24−26 The CNFs have a higher aspect
ratio and are more ductile, thereby serving as a useful template for
integrating functionality in wound healing.27 Electrospun CNFs have been chemically immobilized with lytic enzymes
to provide anti-staphylococcal activity.28 Bandages composed of surface-decorated nanofibers showed higher
antibacterial activity against S. aureus but exhibited limited cytotoxicity against keratinocytes in a skin
model. Bacterial cellulose-based hydrogels have been fabricated with
acrylic acid polymers for full-thickness wound healing.29 These hydrogels demonstrated excellent properties
and facilitated cell attachment, migration, and proliferation. Regenerated
bacterial cellulose loaded with antibiotics was also used as antibacterial
sponges.30 The sponges effectively minimized
the rate of wound infections and accelerated the wound-healing process.

In this study, CNF was surface-immobilized with AgNPs by in situ
reduction of silver ions and subsequently embedded in alginate hydrogels
to promote antibacterial activity. Sustained release of silver ions
was investigated from AgNP-decorated CNF. Furthermore, the antibacterial
activity of the hydrogel was investigated and compared with that of
CNF incorporated with silver ions. Cytotoxicity against fibroblasts
was evaluated to assess the potential damage to animal cells.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
schematic presentation of the development of antibacterial hydrogels
containing AgNP-incorporated nanofibers (AL/AgNP@TCNP). The hydroxyl
groups of CNFs were oxidized to carboxylate groups by (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl
(TEMPO) to facilitate the electrostatic adsorption of silver ions
on TCNF. The carboxyl group contents in TCNF was confirmed to be 1.3–1.6
mmol/g in the previous study.26 The incorporated
silver ions were then reduced to metallic silver in situ to form AgNP-incorporated
TCNF (AgNP@TCNF) (Figure 1A). To fabricate nanofiber-embedded hydrogels, AgNP@TCNF was
mixed with alginate solution and the mixture was cross-linked in calcium
solution to form the AL/AgNP@TCNF hydrogels. We sequentially employed
CaSO4 and CaCl2 to control gelation rates, wherein
the first gelation step produced injectable gels and the secondary
gelation step increased the mechanical properties via complete cross-linking
of alginate. This strategy allows the formation of a custom-made hydrogel
capable of fitting into any surface. Previous studies have shown that
CaSO4-based pregelation is needed to form an injectable
gel for applications in three-dimensional bioprinting.33 These studies highlight that the two-step strategies
of cross-linking are advantageous for controlling the gelation times
and the mechanical properties of the cross-linked hydrogels. Thus,
we speculate that these antibacterial hydrogels may adopt various
shapes to cover the affected skin areas and can be further solidified
via secondary cross-linking to improve the mechanical properties.

situ reduction of silver-adsorbed TEMPO-oxidized cellulose
nanofibers (TCNFs) for the fabrication of silver nanoparticle (AgNP)
immobilized TCNFs. TCNFs were immersed in 10 mM AgNO3 solution
(Ag+@TCNF) and subsequently reduced to form AgNP-immobilized
TCNFs (AgNP@TCNFs) in a 0.1% (v/v) formaldehyde solution. (B) Schematic
diagram of the preparation of AgNP@TCNF-embedded alginate hydrogels
(AL/AgNP@TCNF). A solution of 2% (w/v) alginate was mixed with AgNP@TCNF,
presolidified in 0.5% (w/v) CaSO4; the mixture was injected
in a customized shape. A solution of 1% (w/v) CaCl2 was
employed to completely solidify the TCNF hydrogel patch.

To fabricate the AgNP-adsorbed CNF or TCNF, we
reduced the silver-ions-adsorbed
nanofiber and performed characterization studies, as shown in Figure 2. We first oxidized
CNF to TCNF with TEMPO treatment to convert the hydroxyl groups of
carboxylic acids. Solid-state 13C NMR indicated that both
TCNF and CNF exhibited peaks of C1 (104 ppm), C2, C3, C5 (72 and 74
ppm), C4 (83 and 88 ppm), and C6 (64 ppm), whereas TCNF showed a distinctive
peak of carboxyl group (104 ppm), suggesting that the carboxyl groups
were newly formed on TCNF (Figure S1).
Although bare CNF and TCNF showed similar morphologies in the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images, these nanofibers displayed different
surface morphologies after in situ reduction; in comparison to CNF,
TCNF showed a rough morphology, which was associated with the higher
number of nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface. The size of the adsorbed
silver nanoparticle was 12.578 ± 3.34 nm, which is based on the
image analysis of the SEM images. In addition, we obtained energy-dispersive
surface spectra (EDS) and confirmed that these particles were AgNP,
as distinct silver peaks were observed for both nanofiber types. However,
the comparison of the relative peak intensity of silver atoms revealed
that the silver peak of AgNP@TCNF was higher than that of AgNP@CNF.
As the carbon and oxygen peaks in both spectra showed the same intensity,
the higher intensity of silver indicated that the surface of AgNP@TCNF
was covered with higher amounts of silver than the surface of AgNP@CNF.
This observation may be attributed to the fact that the anionic surface
of TCNF electrostatically adsorbed the negatively-charged silver ions
and the higher density of silver ions on the surface of TCNF led to
the efficient reduction of silver ions to AgNP, whereas the low density
of silver ions on CNF produced very few AgNPs. As shown in Figure 2B, we also observed
that the intense dark brown color indicative of reduced silver was
more evident in AgNP@TCNF than in AgNP@CNF. Therefore, this result
clearly indicates that TCNF is superior to CNF in the process of in
situ AgNP formation.

electron
microscopy (SEM) of CNF, AgNP@CNF, TCNF, and AgNP@TCNF. Energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) spectra of AgNP@TCNF and AgNP@CNF were obtained
for elemental detection of C, O, and Ag (inset image) (scale bar =
500 nm) (B) photos of CNF, TCNF, AgNP@CNF, and AgNP@TCNF dispersed
in water.

We analyzed AgNP@TCNF and AgNP@CNF
with X-ray diffraction (XRD)
and the amount of incorporated AgNP was quantified (Figure 3). AgNP@TCNF showed distinctive
peaks of silver at degrees of 37.84, 64.09, and 77.22 in the region
from 5 to 89° (Figure 3A). However, AgNP@CNF and other nanofibers failed to show
any significant peaks of silver at the designated degrees. Although
we observed much smaller and less-frequent AgNPs with AgNP@CNF than
with AgNP@TCNF, the amount of AgNPs on AgNP@CNF was insufficient to
affect the XRD pattern. To determine the effects of silver adsorption
period on the incorporation of AgNP, we dipped TCNF or CNF in HNO3 for 24 h and monitored the amount of AgNP on both nanofiber
types (Figure 3B).
The measurement of AgNP adsorption level after 24 h by inductively
coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) revealed that
AgNP@TCNF and AgNP@CNF showed 32.66 ± 2.10 and 3.60 ± 0.64
μg/mg of AgNP adsorption, respectively. After confirming that
the silver ions were not further reduced to metallic silver after
a 30 min treatment with formaldehyde, we speculated that the formation
of AgNP was mostly affected by the amount of silver adsorbed on nanofibrils.
The initial burst of silver adsorption primarily occurred within 3
h and no significant increase in silver adsorption was observed thereafter,
which is an adsorption pattern typical of electrostatic interactions.
These results clearly suggest that there was extensive silver coating
on the surface of TCNF in comparison to CNF, subsequently inducing
the efficient formation of AgNPs on the surface of nanofibers upon
in situ reduction.

Figure 3 Qualitative and quantitative analyses of AgNP on CNF and
TCNF.
(A) X-ray diffraction patterns of CNF, TCNF, AgNP@CNF, and AgNP@TCNF.
XRD patterns of the samples were measured using an X-ray beam with
a Cu radiation of 1.54 Å at 40 kV and 30 mA. The patterns were
collected in the region of 2θ from 5 to 89° at a scanning
rate of 0.08°/min. (B) Quantification of adsorbed AgNP on the
surface of CNF and TCNF by ICP-OES. The samples dissolved in 10% HNO3 were subjected to quantification with ICP-OES.

To compare the antibacterial properties of hydrogels
with AgNP@TCNF
and Ag+@TCNF, we first determined the release profiles
of silver from each hydrogel (Figure 4A). After 1 week, the cumulative release of silver
from AL/AgNP@TCNF and AL/Ag+@TCNF was 15.45 ± 0.4
and 11.56 ± 0.04 μg, respectively. As the same amount of
silver was incorporated in these hydrogels, the release of silver
was slightly higher in AL/AgNP@TCNF and the overall levels of the
released silver were considerably lower than the initial levels of
silver. We speculated that alginate hydrogel significantly attenuates
silver release from the matrix. To quantify the antibacterial efficacy
of AL/AgNP@TCNF and AL/Ag+@TCNF, a live/dead assay for
bacterial cells and a disk diffusion test with E. coli were performed (Figure 4B–D). On day 7, all the hydrogels containing TCNF with
silver ions (AgNP@TCNF and Ag+@TCNF) showed similar levels
of antibacterial activity, whereas the G/R ratio decreased by 3- to
4-fold as compared to the untreated control group. We observed that
the G/R ratio of bacteria within these hydrogels was similar to that
observed following incubation in a minimum bacterial concentration
(MBC) of silver solution (25 μg/mL). The MBC concentration was
determined by incubating bacterial cells in AgNO3 solutions
of different concentrations (0–50 μg/mL) (Figure S2). The antibacterial activities were
also assessed by confocal microscopy (Figure 4C) and the bacterial cells treated with the
released fractions of hydrogels containing AgNP@TCNF or Ag+@TCNF showed higher intensities of red fluorescence than those without
treatment. Thus, both hydrogels significantly suppressed the bacterial
growth for 24 h because the released amount of silver was between
11.4 and 15.4 μg.

control (without AgNO3), AL/AgNP@TCNF, AL/Ag+@TCNF, and positive control (AgNO3 25 μg/mL). Hydrogels

fractions. Live bacterium ratio was calculated by dividing the red
fluorescence intensity by the green fluorescence intensity. (C) Fluorescence

(D) The zones of E. coli growth inhibition
in the presence of AL/AgNP@TCNF, AL/Ag+@TCNF, and AL/TCNF
for 24 h (scale bar = 2 mm).

To assess the antibacterial properties of these hydrogels,
we placed
the hydrogel patches containing AgNP@TCNF or Ag+@TCNF on
bacteria-containing agar plates and measured the zones of growth inhibition
after 24 h (Figure 4D). An AL/TCNF hydrogel patch was employed as a negative control.
All the TNCF-embedded hydrogel showed a homogeneous mixing in the
hydrogels, where brownish color of AgNP@TCNF was distributed throughout
the matrix (Figure 4D, AL/AgNP@TCNF). The diameters of the inhibition zones were 15,
17, and 19 mm for AL/TCNF, AL/AgNP@TCNF, and AL/Ag+@TCNF,
respectively. A slightly larger zone was observed with the hydrogel
patch containing Ag+@TCNF than with the patch containing
AgNP@TCNF, which may be attributed to the rapid diffusion of silver
ions. The hydrogel patch was in place for only 24 h, which seems too
short a period for AgNP@TCNF to release enough silver ions to generate
antibacterial activity. Although we could not employ an incubation
period longer than 24 h because of the limitation of the test, we
speculate higher antibacterial activities owing to comparable antibacterial
activities between AL/AgNP@TCNF and AL/Ag+@TCNF in the
released fractions for 7 days. Furthermore, as silver ions are considered
cytotoxic to animal cells at high concentrations, the sustained, slow
release of silver would be optimal at concentrations that are low
enough to minimize cytotoxicity but sufficient enough for exert antibacterial
activity. Several studies have indicated that silver ions are released
from AgNP upon the gradual oxidation of the atomic silver in the air
over a period of approximately 3–7 days. AgNP-embedded bacterial
cellulose showed a gradual release profile for 6 days, and 20–28%
release of silver was observed according to NaBH4/AgNO3 molar ratios.34 In another study,
in situ formation of AgNP on the surface of bacterial cellulose was
shown to attenuate the release of Ag cations because of the strong
adhesion between AgNP and the cellulose surface, wherein the release
profile was dictated by Fickian diffusion model in response to the
ionization of atomic silver.14

Most
published reports have employed AgNP or AgNP-immobilized matrices
to facilitate optimum silver release. However, we embedded AgNP-adsorbed
nanofibers to ensure maximum AgNP immobilization, owing to the high
surface-to-volume ratio of the nanostructures. Furthermore, we speculate
that the burst release of silver could be attenuated because the diffusion
of positively charged silver ions out of the negatively charged alginate
cage was controlled both by physical and electrostatic interactions.
Thus, AL/AgNP@TCNF could release silver ions at levels similar to
those observed with hydrogels (AL/Ag+@TCNF) incorporated
with silver ions, and the released silver from AL/AgNP@TCNF showed
antibacterial activity that was comparable to that of the silver-ion-incorporated
hydrogel matrices. Additionally, we did not examine the mechanical
properties of AgNP@TCNF-embedded alginate hydrogels because the alginate
hydrogel play a role of gluing silver-incorporated nanofibrils in
the matrix. However, we speculate that mechanical properties should
be further examined for industrial application of our hydrogel system.

To determine the cytotoxicity of silver-incorporated nanofibers,
NIH3T3 cells were incubated with various concentrations of AgNP@TCNF
and Ag+@TCNF, and the viability was monitored for 48 h
(Figure 5). AgNP@TCNF
showed cytotoxicity similar to that observed for the untreated group
(black bar) in response to various silver concentrations (1–10
μg/mL) for 48 h, indicating that AgNP@TCNF displays minimum
cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells. Ag+@TCNF showed
major cytotoxicity at concentrations of 5–10 μg/mL, but
no cytotoxicity was observed at the lowest concentration (1 μg/mL);
the viability was 74–78 and 76–78% at silver concentrations
of 5 and 10 μg/mL, respectively. Previous studies indicated
that higher concentrations of silver cations are cytotoxic to eukaryotic
cells. AgNP-incorporated chitosan scaffolds showed extreme cytotoxicity
against fibroblasts in the presence of silver from 3.7 to 177.9 mg/device
and a 9–18% inhibition of cell proliferation.15 In another study, however, AgNP-incorporated bacterial
cellulose showed low toxicity and supported the proliferation and
differentiation of epidermal cells for longer than 3 days.14 We speculate that additional animal study can
be required to claim the potential advantages of our hydrogels; however,
animal model simulating a bacterial infection condition is required
to monitor the dramatic difference among the groups because the antibacterial
effect of silver is supportive of the wound-healing process.35 Additionally, we did not employ alginate for
cytotoxicity assay for animal cells because antiproliferation effect
was further attenuated when AgNP@TCNF was encapsulated in the alginate
gel. Thus, we speculate that AL/AgNP@TCNF and AL/Ag+@TCNF
should be further noncytotoxic.

Figure 5 Cytotoxicity assay of AgNP@TCNF and Ag+@TCNF in NIH3T3
cells. WST-1-based cytotoxicity assay was performed for AgNP@TCNF
and Ag+@TCNF with different concentrations of silver equivalents
ranging from 1 to 10 μg/mL. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded
at 0, 12, and 48 h (n = 3). NIH3T3 cells (5 ×
103 cells/well) were seeded in each well (96-well plate).
Asterisk (*) indicates statistically significant level at p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Thus, these findings highlight
that the sustained release of silver
cations from AgNP@TCNF is highly advantageous for minimizing the cytotoxicity
to eukaryotic cells. We did not test the cytotoxicity of AL/AgNP@TCNF
because of limitations of the assay; however, we expect little or
no cytotoxicity of AL/AgNP@TCNF, as the same AgNP@TCNF was embedded
in the hydrogel.

Conclusions
Hydroxyl groups of CNFs
were converted to carboxyl groups to ensure
efficient adsorption of silver ions on the surfaces of CNFs, wherein
AgNPs were formed in situ in formaldehyde solution. The AgNP@TCNF-embedded
alginate hydrogel showed sustained release of Ag+ for extended
period of time and the released media from the hydrogel significantly
attenuated the bacterial growth without any cytotoxicity toward animal
cells. Thus, the current hybrid hydrogel is expected to be a superior
candidate for wound dressing with prolonged antibacterial activity.

(TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TCNFs) and CNFs were donated
by the Korean Forest Research Institute (Seoul, Korea) and used for
the study without further modifications.31−32 Silver(I) nitrate (AgNO3), calcium sulfate anhydrous (CaSO4), calcium chloride
(CaCl2), and t-butanol (C4H10O) were purchased from Daejung Chemical (Seoul, Korea). Formaldehyde

was acquired from DoGenBio Co. Ltd. (Seoul, Korea).

In Situ Reduction
of Silver Ions (Ag+) on TCNF and
CNF
To modify the surfaces of TCNF and CNF with AgNPs, silver
ions were in situ reduced to AgNP on TCNF or CNF in an AgNO3 solution (Figure 1A). Briefly, 3 mL of CNF (10 mg/mL) or TCNF (15 mg/mL) was mixed
with 30 mL of AgNO3 solution (10 mM) and the mixture was
incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 1 h to facilitate
Ag+ adsorption. Silver-ions-adsorbed TCNF (Ag+@TCNF) and CNF (Ag+@CNF) were thoroughly washed with distilled
water (dH2O) twice to remove the unbound Ag+. Ag+@TCNF and Ag+@CNF were subsequently reduced
with 30 mL of Na2CO3 solution (3%, w/v) containing
formaldehyde (0.1%, v/v) at room temperature for 20 min. After washing
twice with dH2O to remove the residual chemicals, the amount
of reduced AgNPs on the surface of TCNF or CNF was quantified by inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Optima 7300
DV, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). To prepare samples for ICP-OES, the
AgNPs on the surface of TCNF and CNF were dissolved in HNO3 (10%, v/v), and the solutions were filtered through 0.45 μm
filters.

Characterization of AgNP-Modified TCNF (AgNP@TCNF) and CNF (AgNP@CNF)
We characterized TCNF and CNF with nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry
(13C NMR; Unity-Inova 600 MHz, Varian Technologies) and
the degree of AgNP adsorption on the surfaces was examined by X-ray
diffractometry (XRD; X’pert-pro MPD, PANalytical, Netherlands),
ICP-OES, and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) equipped ultrahigh-resolution
scanning electron microscopy (UHR-SEM) in the Central Laboratory of
Kangwon National University. For XRD spectroscopy, an X-ray beam with
Cu radiation of 1.54 Å at 40 kV and 30 mA was irradiated on 100
mg of TCNF, CNF, AgNP@TCNF, and Ag@CNF. Atomic silver was employed
for a reference spectrum to determine the surface deposition of AgNP.
For the quantification of AgNP, AgNP@TCNF, and Ag@CNF were dipped
in 10 mM AgNO3 solution for 0–24 h and then reduced
to AgNP in a 0.1% (v/v) formaldehyde solution containing 3% (w/v)
Na2CO3 to determine the effects of preincubation
time on AgNP incorporation. The amount of silver incorporated was
determined by ICP-OES, as described above. For SEM examination, the
AgNP@TCNF or AgNP@CNF solution was semidried at ambient temperature
and the solvent exchanged with n-butanol for freeze-drying.
The freeze-dried samples were coated with iridium and examined by
UHR-SEM at 1 kV (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). Chemical microanalysis was
performed with EDS at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV.

In Situ Formation
of AL/AgNP@TCNF and AL/Ag+@TCNF
Hybrid Gel
To fabricate an injectable hybrid gel, an alginate
solution (2%, w/v) was loosely cross-linked with CaSO4 solution
(0.5%, w/v) and then uniformly mixed with AgNP@TCNF in a 1:1 ratio
through gentle pipetting (Figure 1B). The mixture was completely cross-linked with CaCl2 (1%, w/v) for 20 min to increase the physical strength and
then washed twice with PBS (pH = 7.4). For antibacterial tests, AL/AgNP@TCNF
was fabricated into the shape of a disk using a poly(dimethylsiloxane)
mold (ϕ = 1.5 cm). AL/Ag+@TCNF was prepared under
the same conditions.

In Vitro Release of Ag+ from AL/AgNP@TCNF
and AL/Ag+@TCNF
To investigate the release profile
of Ag+ from AL/AgNP@TCNF and AL/Ag+@TCNF, the
samples
(thickness = 2 mm, diameter = 10 mm) were incubated in 5 mL of PBS
(pH = 7.4) containing 10% t-butanol at 37 °C
with shaking at 300 rpm. At predetermined timepoints (1, 3, and 7
days), the samples were centrifuged, supernatants were collected for
ICP-OES analysis, and the same volume of fresh releasing medium was
added. To prepare samples for ICP-OES, the supernatants were freeze-dried,
dissolved in 10% HNO3, and the solutions filtered through
0.45 μm filters.

Antibacterial Activity Test
Three
different methods
were used to investigate the antibacterial activities of AL/AgNP@TCNF
and AL/Ag+@TCNF against E. coli. To visualize and quantify the antibacterial effect of the hybrid
hydrogel, a live/dead assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the hydrogels were incubated in a releasing
buffer for 7 days and the supernatants were collected, freeze-dried,
and resuspended in 1 mL of dH2O. Each sample was treated
with 1 mL of LB broth containing E. coli (1 × 108 cells/mL) and incubated on an orbital shaker
at 37 °C for 12 h. To quantify bacterial viability, 100 μL
of the cell suspension was mixed with the same volume of a dye mixture
containing SYTO-9 and propidium iodide (PI) in a 96-well plate and
incubated for 15 min. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a
fluorescence microplate reader (Synergy H1, Biotech) with an excitation
wavelength of 485 nm (SYTO-9 and PI) and emission wavelengths of 530
nm (SYTO-9) and 630 nm (PI). Cell viability was calculated by dividing
the live cell fluorescence intensity at 530 nm (I530) by the dead cell fluorescence intensity at 630 nm
(I630) using the following equation  For visualization, bacteria in the
incubation
medium were fluorescently stained with SYTO-9 and PI for 30 min and
observed by high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM880,
Carl Zeiss, Germany) at the Central Laboratory of Kangwon National
University. For the disk diffusion test in LB agar plate, a hybrid
hydrogel (AL/AgNP@TCNF, AL/Ag+@TCNF, and AL/TCNF) (thickness
= 2 mm, diameter = 1.5 cm) was autoclaved and placed on an agar plate
inoculated with 100 μL of E. coli (1 × 108 cells/mL). After incubation at 37 °C
for 24 h, the diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured.

Animal
Cell Viability Assay
To compare the cytotoxicity
of AgNP@TCNF and Ag+@TCNF against animal cells, WST-1-based
cytotoxicity assay was performed using the NIH3T3 cell line. The NIH3T3
cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a cell density of 5 ×
103 cells/well in 200 μL of DMEM supplemented with
10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and cultivated
at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in a humidified
atmosphere for 24 h. After removing the media, the cells were treated
with different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μg/mL) of AgNP@TCNF
or Ag+@TCNF in DMEM (200 μL). After 24 and 48 h treatment,
the media were replaced with 200 μL of fresh media and 20 μL
of WST-1 solution, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. The
optical density of the supernatant was measured at 450 nm wavelength
to evaluate the cell viability.

Statistical Analysis
All the data were evaluated with
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and presented as the mean ±
standard deviation. A value of p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
