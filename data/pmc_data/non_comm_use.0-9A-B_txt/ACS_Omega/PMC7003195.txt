It
is known that reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS)
species
play a diverse role in various biological processes, such as inflammation,
signal transduction, and neurodegenerative injury, apart from causing
various diseases caused by oxidative and nitrosative stresses, respectively,
by ROS and RNS. Thus, it is very important to quantify the concentration
level of ROS and RNS in live cells, tissues, and organisms. Various
small-molecule-based fluorescent/chemodosimetric probes are reported
to quantify and map the effective distribution of ROS/RNS under in
vitro/in vivo conditions with a great spatial and temporal resolution.
Such reagents are now appreciated as an excellent tool for aiding
breakthroughs in modern redox biology. This mini-review is a brief,
but all-inclusive, account of such molecular probes that have been
developed recently.

Introduction
In recent years, the efficacies of clinical
diagnostics, therapeutics,
and medicines have emerged due to our better insights and recent advances
in the understanding of various biological processes at the cellular
and molecular levels.1 The biology of reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) is linked
to the involvement of these intracellular molecular entities in various
biological processes.1−3 Endogenous ROS and RNS are formed through various
intracellular biochemical processes, including nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and mitochondrial electron transport
chain.4,5 Exogenous sources (e.g., radiation, air
pollutants, and certain redox-active xenobiotics) also cause an elevated
level of ROS/RNS in living organisms.6 ROS/RNS
participate in biological processes as immunotoxins as well as immunomodulators,
and their effective build-up in a living organism is linked to its
generation as the byproducts of aerobic metabolism and the immune
system processes.7 Accumulation of the
higher than the optimal level of ROS overhauls the antioxidant mechanisms
and attributes to oxidative cellular stress.8 Mechanisms or the biochemical processes which control the production
of intracellular ROS/RNS are not well comprehended, and it is pertinent
to develop diagnostic strategies at cellular sites of dysfunction.9

Among various ROS and RNS that are operational
in living organisms,
we shall limit our discussions on the strategies for clinical diagnosis
of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as ROS and nitroxyl (HNO) as the RNS for
this mini-review. The biochemistry of HOCl helps the neutrophils to
kill a wide range of infectious agents.10 It is produced during an oxidation reaction between the H2O2 and Cl– ions which is catalyzed by
the myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme, excreted by neutrophils in its inflammatory
state.10 Even though it plays a defensive
role in human health, the elevated levels of HOCl are known to cause
tissue damage and several diseases such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis,
lung injury, rheumatoid, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative
conditions, and various cancers.10,11

The
chemistry of HNO (nitroxyl) and its conjugated base NO– is rather less explored as compared to HOCl. HNO is
the protonated one-electron reduction product of NO and is isoelectronic
with an oxygen molecule (O2). Unlike HOCl, the knowledge
base for insight into the role of HNO in human physiology is still
in its infancy. Angeli’s salt is the most commonly used chemical
for the in situ generations of HNO (rate constant of 4.6 × 10–4 s–1 (at room temperature)), and
this process is favored over a pH range of 4–8.12,13 Commercial availability of this salt has helped in developing the
mechanistic insights of reactions involving HNO with a particular
emphasis on elucidation of the biochemical/physiological role. The
linear HNO structure is less stable than the bent form by ca. 67 kcal/mol.
Computational studies predicted the possible presence of a triplet
state having energy of 18.0–19.0 kcal over the ground singlet
state.14,15 However, to date, experimental evidence
for 3HNO is missing. Importantly, for NO– the triplet state (ground state) is more stable than the singlet
state by ca. 16 kcal/mol.16 Thus, the deprotonation
process is associated with a change in spin state and is spin forbidden
(adiabatic singlet–triplet transition energy is 18.45 kcal/mol),17 and its generation is a slow process, which
is attributed to HNO as the prevalent species (pKaHNO = 11.4)18 at
physiological pH.

HNO is associated with numerous biological
activities with significant
therapeutic potential. A series of reports reveal that the alcohol-deterrent
drug cyanamide (NH2CN) is really a prodrug for HNO, an
inhibitor of the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme.19 HNO has unique positive lusitropic and ionotropic effects
in heart failure without a chronotropic effect and shows favorable
effects in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recent studies also reveal
the role of HNO in cancer therapy.

Considering such significances,
reagents for efficient recognition,
quantification, and mapping of intracellular HOCl and HNO-inappropriate
organelles or quantification in suitable biofluids are highly desired.
This has attracted much attention among the researchers who are active
in the area of chemical biology, environmental science, and clinical
diagnostics. In recent years, a number of reports on fluorogenic receptors
describing specific detection of these two analytes have appeared.
In this short account, we shall limit our discussion only to the recently
reported chemodosimetric receptors for HOCl and HNO. There is a recent
account published by Wu, Chen, Yoon, and their co-workers on receptors
that are specific toward HOCl. Those examples shall be avoided in
this mini-review to avoid any repetition.

Results and Discussion
Receptors
for HOCl
HOCl is an efficient antimicrobial
ROS with high oxidizing potential and is commonly produced in higher
eukaryotes. HOCl oxidizes amino acids containing amines and sulfurs;
in particular, methionine residues are oxidized to the corresponding
methionine sulfoxide. The conversion of methionine sulfoxide is an
efficient one with reaction rate approaching the diffusion limit.
Recent studies reveal that a HOCl-specific transcription factor (HypT)
contributes to HOCl resistance by upregulating the biochemical synthesis
of three methionine residues (Met123, Met206, and Met230). This oxidizing
efficiency of HOCl is being largely utilized for developing various
chemodosimetric molecular probes.

Yang and his team reported
an aqueous-soluble p-methoxyphenol derivative (1) as the dual-signaling (colorimetric and fluorimetric) chemodosimetric
probe for HOCl in aqueous PBS buffer (pH 7.4) medium (Figure 1).20 Following oxidation of 1 to the corresponding quinonoid
derivative, a distinct change in the absorption maxima from 314 to
393 nm was observed with an associated reduction in the emission quantum
yield at 388 nm. Other ROS and RNS species (H2O2, 1O2, O2•–, •OH, •NO, ONOO–, and ROO•) failed to induce, and detectable changes
in the optical spectrum for 1 and these data ensured
specificity of this reagent toward HOCl. This was one of the initial
reports on HOCl recognition. Presumably, the luminescence quenching
process was the deterrent factor for the authors for exploring the
option of using this reagent for intracellular studies.

process for HOCl by the reagent 1.

Chen et al. reported the iridium(III) complex (2)
having an oximated 2,2′-bipyridine for detection of ClO–.21 A facile C=N–OH
isomerization was attributed to an efficient nonradiative decay process
and the poor emission quantum yield (Figure 2). Selective oxidation of the oxime to an
aldehyde or carboxylic acid, induced by ClO–, caused
a luminescence ON response having a luminescence maximum at 578 nm
(λex = 346 nm) in DMF:aq. HEPES buffer medium (pH
7.2). An oxidized carboxy derivative showed a bright orange-yellow
luminescence coming from from [5d(Ir) → π*(bpy)] 3MLCT and [π(ppy) → π*(bpy)] 3LLCT triplet excited states. The authors ensured the specificity
of the reagent 2 toward ClO– in the
presence of other common ROS species. Moreover, the use of test strips
comprising 2 showed very promising sensitivity to ClO–. Similar oxime based probes 3 and 4 were also reported for specific detection of ClO–.22,23

A similar methodology
was utilized for developing
a rhodamine-based
luminophore (5), and this was further explored for mapping
of the endogenous HOCl in live HeLa cells (Figure 3).24

Loo, Zhang, and co-workers reported a hybrid upconversion
luminescence
(UCL) detection system (6) for HOCl (Figure 4).25 Upconverting luminescence nanoparticles (UCNP) are generally preferred
over conventional luminescent molecular probes owing to their stability
toward photobleaching, deeper tissue penetration of the near-infrared
(NIR) active radiation, minimal or no self-induced fluorescence, and
less tissue damage.26−28 The extent of loading of the rhodamine-based oxidizable
receptor was calculated as ∼5.81 wt %. The amino-terminated
rhodamine derivative was loaded onto the surface of UCNPs via interactions
with oleic acid (OA) termini. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) was further used
to replace OA ligands from the surface of UCNPs, which not only helped
in creating an aqueous-soluble triple-layer nanostructure but also
prevented the rhodamine derivative from detachment from the UCNP surface.
Upon reaction of 6 with HOCl, there was a gradual decrease
in green emission from UCL with concomitant increase in the rhodamine-based
emission due to the conversion of the cyclic lactam from an acyclic
xanthene form through an efficient FRET-based energy transfer process.
This ratiometric response was successfully utilized for mapping intracellular
HOCl that was released by MPO-mediated peroxidation of chloride ions
in living cells. A similar probe 7 was further reported
by Xu et al. for specific detection of HOCl.29

The sulfur-containing rhodamine derivatives showed
greater selectivities
for OCl– than those of Se and Te. In 2007, Nagano
and co-workers presumably were the first to demonstrate this using
an appropriate S-functionalized rhodamine derivative (8).30 Authors have also demonstrated the
use of this reagent for mapping the hypochlorous acid that was created
inside phagosomes in real time (Figure 5).

A single conjugated flexible polymer having reactive
centers for
HOCl and target-inert fluorophores was designed. This far-red to NIR
nanoprobe (10) helped in identifying intracellular HOCl
through a FRET-based ratiometric detection (Figure 7).32 Reagent 10 was successfully used for mapping of HOCl fluctuations
in macrophage cells. The dual-emission property of 10 enabled a more sensitive mapping of ClO– in peritonitis
in mice with high contrast.

The azo functionality having an o-amino group
substituted in a phenyl ring undergoes selective oxidation with HOCl
to produce a triazole functionality. This was utilized in developing
Ru(II)-polypyridyl-based luminescent sensors (11 and 12) for HOCl (Figure 8).33

(SR-SIM) images confirmed localization of the reagent in the Golgi
complex and lysosomes. Importantly, reagent 13 was found
to be suitable with 3D-SIM imaging of a single cell.

Two-Photon Reagents for
HOCl Recognition
Presumably,
the first two-photon (TP) active reagent for HOCl was reported by
Chang and co-workers.35 The first TP-active
reagents (14 and 15) that were specific
for imaging HOCl in the mitochondria (14) and lysosome
(15) are shown in Figure 10.35 These probes
showed good selectivity toward HOCl. In particular, the TP imaging
of 14 and 15 in the murine model revealed
that the elevated amount of HOCl could be identified in both the mitochondria
and lysosome of macrophage cells under inflammation conditions. Thus,
these reagents could be utilized to understand the roles of HOCl at
subcellular levels.

hypodermically injected into the right rear paws of the mouse to cause
inflammation. After 1 day, 200 μL of 1 mM 14 (or 15) was intravenously injected, and the paw skin was sectioned
1 h later. (c) CLSM images of reagent and CD11b in the inflamed tissue.

A new TP fluorescent probe (16) having
a pendant imidazoline-2-thione
as an OCl– identification unit and triphenylphosphine
as a mitochondrial-targeting group were reported.36 The precise reaction among imidazoline-2-thione and OCl–® accounted for the luminescence ON response
and the basis for specific recognition even in the presence of other
ROS species. This TP-active reagent 16 was utilized to
image endogenously created mitochondrial OCl– in
live HeLa, HepG2, and RAW 264.7 cells via TP microscopy (Figure 11). Despite being
TP-active, this reagent was not utilized for tissue imaging.

min. The TPM was collected at 400–600 nm upon excitation at
700 nm with femtosecond pulses. Scale bars: (upper) 48 μm and
(lower) 18 μm. Figure 11b was reprinted from ref (36). Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society.

The two-photon activity of the naphathalimide derivative
was utilized
for developing a lysosome-specific luminescent molecular probe (17) that had morpholine functionality as the lysosome-targeting
group.37 Reagent 17 was oxidized
to the corresponding sulfoxide species by ClO– with
an associated luminescence OFF response. Unlike other examples, this
reaction triggered an OFF response, which could be revived by GSH.

The naphthoimidazolium borane derivative (18) participated
in an electrophilic oxidation mechanism associated with B–H
bond degradation to yield a TP-active naphthoimidazolium derivative.38 This reagent could be utilized for monitoring
of endogenously produced HOCl and the changes in endoplasmic reticulum
during oxidative stress situations. Endogenous OCl– mapping in macrophages was then studied. Macrophages were stimulated
by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and interferon γ (IFN-γ).
MPO was attributed to an in situ generation of OCl– and was further treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). These
studies confirmed the efficacy of the reagent for recognition of intracellular
OCl– through TP microscopy (Figure 12).

Guo and co-workers have
reported a series of reagents
for intracellular
quantification of HOCl by introducing a bioorthogonal dimethylthiocarbamate
receptor (Figure 13).39 The authors have successfully demonstrated
the role of the S atom in designing this set of molecular probes (Figure 13 a). Among these,
reagent 19 is found to be the most efficient one, while
allowing a ratiometric luminescence response on a specific reaction
with HOCl at high risk pathogenic concentrations (0.47 mM). This reagent
showed 48-fold enhancement in the ratio for I468 nm/I630 nm with a
good linear
relationship. The release of the thiocarbamate moiety of 19 on reaction with HOCl led to the generation of the corresponding
phenol derivative having a luminescence maximum of 468 nm. The formation
of the phenolic derivative induced an excited-state intramolecular
proton transfer and intramolecular charge transfer processes to result
in a 468 nm luminescence. The authors could demonstrate the use of
this reagent for monitoring the oxidative stress process induced by
elesclomol in live cancer cells (Figure 13b).

Various Receptors for HNO
Initially
it was perceived
that HNO chemical biology was similar
to NO as a biological conciliator. Unfavorable redox potential does
not allow a facile reduction of NO to HNO in physiological conditions.
However, moderate H–NO bond strength (50 kcal mol–1) makes HNO a more efficient hydrogen atom donor than many other
biological antioxidants. This may potentially react with the appropriate
ROS/RNS-based radical species to generate NO, which subsequently reacts,
oxidizing radical species to quench.40 There
is a recent short account on receptors that are specific toward HNO
published by Lin and co-workers. We shall be avowing any appreciable
overlap with examples that are discussed in this mini-review.

Thus, the reactivity and biological implications of HNO and NO
are not similar; it is worth knowing some of the early reports by
Lippard and co-workers in NO recognition. These results have certainly
helped researchers in understanding the clinical biology of HNO and
are mentioned briefly before discussing some of the recent efforts
on HNO recognition.

Lippard’s group reported a series
of Cu(II) complexes for
the detection of NO and were almost silent toward HNO. One of the
representative Cu(II) complexes (20) is shown in Figure 14. These probes
were successfully imaged NO in HeLa cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages.41 Luminescence response of 20 toward
NO was specific. Experimental studies revealed that the NO-triggered
fluorescence enhancement for 19 happened through generation of Cu(I)
with subsequent dissociation to a luminescent secondary amine N–NO
derivative.

To explicate the factors that impart the selectivity
for nitroxyl
(HNO) over nitric oxide (NO) among the metal-based fluorescent reagents,
Lippard and co-workers had studied a series of Cu(II)-cyclam derivatives,
and the one (21) that showed most positive reduction
potential of the series promoted reduction of Cu(II) (Figure 15).42 Generation of Cu(I) with necessary structural changes to adjust
and stabilize the tetrahedral Cu(I) center was stated to be crucial
and attributed to a luminescence ON response. It is worth mentioning
that reduction of the nitrosonium cation (NO+) to NO occurs
at 1.52 V (vs NHE) and fails to reduce Cu(II) in 21.
This is attributed to the specificity toward HNO over NO. Lippard
and co-workers have developed another Cu(II) complex (22) of the mixed thia/aza 14-N2S2 ligand, which
was found to react reversibly with HNO at pH 7.43

Nakagawa et al. introduced a rhodamine-based HNO
specific probe 23 utilizing diphenylphosphine as a response
site. HNO reacted
with the probe to yield a luminescent rhodamine derivative (Figure 16).44

An analogous methodology was utilized by Lin et
al. for developing
reagents (24–26) that were sensitive
to HNO and showed turn ON luminescence response.45 Diphenylphosphine as a responsive site was exploited for
designing these receptors. The reagents could show various emission
colors from green to NIR in response to HNO in aqueous solution and
inside the cells (Figure 17). For the first time, by incubating the living cells with
these reagents simultaneously, we demonstrate the multicolor imaging
of HNO with emission colors in the range of green to NIR in living
systems. Furthermore, reagent 27 showed large turn-on
NIR fluorescence signal upon excitation in the NIR region. This reagent
was also used successfully for detection of HNO in living mice. The
same research group has exploited a similar approach for developing
another rhodamine derivative for recognition of intracellular HNO.46

A similar reaction was utilized by Das and co-workers
for developing
another reagent 28.47 This
reagent showed high specificity toward HNO and localization at the
endoplasmic reticulum of RAW 264.7 cells. This photophysical property
of this reagent was found to be well-suited for its use in SR-SIM
and two-color SIM imaging, permitting more than one organelle to be
imaged at SR-SIM (Figure 18). The option of using this probe for in vivo imaging application
was exhibited using a small marine invertebrate model, Artemia. Designed
substitution at the pyrrole ring with extended conjugation helped
in achieving a luminescence response with maximum at longer wavelength
(586 nm).

The analogous methodology was adopted for developing
another new
BODIPY derivative (29) for specific recognition of HNO.48 The hydrophobic interior of an amphiphilic copolymer
(mPEG-DSPE; DSPE: 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000) was utilized for encapsulating
the reagent 29 to prepare a micellar nanoprobe. This
reagent showed a ratiometric luminescence response on specific reaction
with HNO. Reagent 29 showed efficient cellular internalization
and was effectively used to detect HNO in living HepG2 cells, as well
as in zebrafish larvae (Figure 19).

As discussed earlier, the reactivity of HNO with
biological thiols
reaches the diffusion control limit with rate constants ∼109 M–1 s–1. To address this,
Chan and co-workers had reported a new thiol-based reagent (30) that had the potential to compete against reactive thiols
for HNO.49 The molecular structure and
the luminescent reaction product are shown in Figure 20. Treatment of 30 with an HNO
donor resulted in a 16-fold enhancement in luminescence intensity.
Authors have argued that this reagent showed improved specificity
over various ROS/RNS species and efficacy in the presence of biothiols
(e.g., glutathione in mM concentrations).

Conclusions
Significant advances are achieved in designing
appropriate receptors
for HOCl and HNO, and some of the initial and most recent examples
are summarized in this short account. However, more concerted efforts
are still needed to design the probe for efficient application in
clinical biology and therapeutics. To date, there are only a few examples
that are either NIR-active or TP-active. Such reagents open up the
possibility of developing more efficient reagents. It is argued that
one of the unanswered questions in the field of HNO pharmacology/physiology
remains: is HNO endogenously generated as a physiological effector/mediator?
A question which could, perhaps, be addressed by developing a reagent
that tracks/maps the HNO generated through endogenous biosynthesis
during cardiovascular stress. Researchers have not addressed the query:
how can HNO discriminate between thiol proteins? Addressing such unanswered
questions would help in developing an insight into understanding the
proper physiological function for HNO—which in turn would help
us in designing appropriate and efficient receptors for HNO. The chemistry
of HOCl is a little better understood. Still, there are many unanswered
questions for the physiological role of HOCl, and the area of clinical
diagnosis of endogenous HOCl still needs attention. Better insight
into the HOCl defense mechanism at the molecular level and effective
real-time quantification of endogenous HOCl would help not only in
controlling many pathogenic bacteria by counteracting them but also
for developing efficient molecular probes for HOCl.
