Gellan gum is a naturally
occurring polymer that can cross-link
in the presence of divalent cations to form biocompatible hydrogels.
However, physically cross-linked gellan gum hydrogels lose their stability
under physiological conditions, thus restricting the applications
of these hydrogels in vivo. To improve the mechanical strength of
the gels, we incorporated methacrylate into the gellan gum and chemically
cross-linked the hydrogel through three polymerization methods: step
growth through thiol–ene photoclick chemistry, chain-growth
via photopolymerization, and mixed model in which both mechanisms
were employed. Methacrylation was confirmed and quantified by proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy. The mechanical properties and chemistry of
the cross-linked gels were systematically altered by varying the reaction
conditions. The compression moduli of the resulting hydrogels ranged
between 6.4 and 17.2 kPa. The swelling ratios of the hydrogels were
correlated with the compression moduli and affected by the addition
of calcium. In vitro enzymatic degradation rate was found to depend
on the degree of methacrylation. NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell proliferation
and morphology were related to substrate stiffness, with a high stiffness
leading generally to higher proliferation. The proliferation is further
affected by the thiol–ene ratio. These results suggest that
a hydrogel platform based on the gellan gum can offer versatile chemical
modifications and tunable mechanical properties. The influence of
these substrates on cell behavior suggests that the gellan gum hydrogels
have the flexibility to be engineered for a variety of biomaterials
applications.

1 Introduction
The
overriding design principles for tissue engineering scaffolds
are that the scaffold should best simulate the properties of the native
tissue.1 Namely, the scaffolds should have
similar mechanical properties to the tissue it will replace, the scaffold
should be biocompatible, and the degradation rate of the scaffold
should match that of the surrounding tissue.1 The native extracellular matrix (ECM) is a scaffold for cells to
attach and proliferate. This structure has a high water content and
a three-dimensional network that can be mimicked by hydrogels. Therefore,
research efforts on designing hydrogels have focused on improving
the biocompatibility and controllable mechanical properties to match
those of native tissues.

Gellan gum is a natural polysaccharide
derived from the bacteria
and has potential applications in this area owing to its biocompatibility
and flexibility for modification. The repeating unit of the gellan
gum is a tetrasaccharide comprising l-rhamnose, d-glucuronic acid, and two d-glucose residues. As with other
polysaccharides, lysozyme secreted by monocytes and neutrophils2 can degrade the backbone.3 The kinetics of degradation can be controlled by altering the degree
of cross-linking, as well as the type of cross-linking bond, which
can be achieved by altering the physical or chemical linkages.4 As with changing degradation profiles, the mechanical
properties can also be altered by modifying the type and degree of
cross-links.4 The mechanical property design
requirements for scaffolds depend on the type of tissue, with softer
(<2 kPa) substrates yielding the desired outcomes for liver and
harder (>40 kPa) implants required for bone tissue engineering.1

Cations can be used to cross-link gellan
gum gels by charge-shielding
the polymer chains, promoting physical cross-links and aggregation.
More specifically, multivalent cations provide bridges between carboxyl
groups and reduce electrical repulsion.5 Although monovalent cations can also screen the charges on gellan
molecules, the interaction is much weaker than the ionic bonds formed
between the carboxylic acids and the divalent cations.5 Therefore, physically cross-linked gellan gum hydrogels
will lose their stability in physiological conditions as the divalent
cations are replaced by monovalent cations that are present at much
higher concentrations in vivo.4

One
way to improve the stability of gellan gum hydrogels is to
covalently cross-link the gel.6−8 Carbodiimide amidation and esterification
are commonly employed to conjugate the abundant carboxylic acid or
hydroxyl groups present on the polysaccharide to a moiety capable
of chemical cross-linking. Glycidyl methacrylate9 and methacrylic anhydride6,8,10 have been successfully used to methacrylate gellan
gum.11,12 Enzymatic degradation of the hydrogel is
retained as lysozyme attacks the backbone and can be tuned based on
the degree of modification with acrylates and thiol concentrations.
Likewise, the mechanical properties of these gels can be similarly
tuned.13−15

The thiol–ene photoclick chemistry provides
another free-radical-mediated
method to synthesize hydrogels using cross-linkers containing multiple
thiol groups.16−18 Specifically, a free radical abstracts a proton from
a thiol, generating a thiyl radical. Subsequent propagation steps
occur in a step-growth mechanism between the thiyl radical and the
vinyl group.19 In this work, we examine
the relationship between the mechanical properties and the cross-linking
mechanism with cell proliferation using covalently cross-linked gellan
gum. Through the introduction of carbon–carbon double bonds
to the gellan gum, the polymer can be photo-cross-linked through chain
growth, step growth, or a combination of the two, termed mixed model,
to form gels with varying compressive moduli. Thiol–ene step-growth
cross-linking is not inhibited by oxygen, therefore chain-growth cross-linking
can be controlled by purging oxygen from the precursor solution. By
adjusting the cross-linking conditions, the mechanical properties
of the gel were systematically varied. The degradation profiles of
these polymers in the presence of lysozyme was also investigated.
Correlations between the mechanical properties and the cell proliferation
were explored.

2 Methods and Materials
2.1 Materials
Gellan gum was purchased
from Spectrum Chemical Mfg. Corp. (New Brunswick, NJ); methacrylate
anhydride (MA) was obtained from BeanTown Chemical (Hudson, NH); 2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone
(Irgacure 2959) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); dithiothreitol
(DTT) was supplied by VWR Chemical (Batavia, IL). Fresh deionized
(DI) water (Milli-Q Nanopure, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was
used throughout this study.

2.2 Gellan Gum Modification
Methacrylated
gellan gum was synthesized via substitution of the hydroxyl groups
in the gellan gum repeating units with MA. Briefly, 1 g gellan gum
was dissolved in 100 mL DI water in a round-bottom flask and heated
to 90 °C for 30 min under constant stirring. The mixture was
slowly cooled to 60 °C and either 3.5 mL or 8.5 mL MA was added
for a low modified gellan gum (LMGG) or a high modified gellan gum
(HMGG), respectively. The pH was maintained between 8 and 9.5. After
4 h, the product was dialyzed (12 000–14 000
molecular weight cutoff) against DI water for at least 3 days. The
DI water was refreshed daily. The final product was lyophilized (Labconco,
Kansas City, MO, 4.5 L).

2.3 Characterization of Modification
of Gellan
Gum
To quantify the percent modification of synthesized LMGG
and HMGG, NMR was used to characterize the polymers. The modified
polymers (10 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL D2O. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer with
a sweep width of 6602.1 Hz, a 90° pulse, and an acquisition time
of 2.48 s. All of the spectra were obtained at room temperature. A
total of 16 repetitive scans with 64 points were acquired and the
data were processed in MNova with 128 k-points, zero
filling, and exponential line broadening of 1.0 Hz. The methyl group
on the rhamnose structural unit on gellan gum was used as a reference
(δ = 1.45 ppm). The degree of substitution was calculated using eq 1. 1  where IDB is the
integration of the double bond proton peak, ICHl3rham is the integration of the reference peak,
ηHDB and ηHCH3rham are the number of protons in the double bond and in the methyl
group on the rhamnose, respectively, and ηOHmonomer is the number of reactive hydroxyl sites on the gellan gum.

2.4 Synthesis of Hydrogels
In 1 mL DI
water, 10 mg modified gellan gum was dissolved at 55 °C. To this
mixture, 1 mg Irgacure 2959 was added. For mixed-model LMGG hydrogels,
either 3.4 or 6.8 μL 10 wt % DTT was added for a thiol–ene
ratio of 0.5 or 1, then 2 μL of 0.5 M CaCl2 were
added to solution before degassing for 20 min. For step-growth and
mixed-model HMGG hydrogels, 10 or 20 μL of 10 wt % DTT was added
such that the thiol-to-alkene mole ratio was 0.5 or 1. To these mixtures,
either 0 or 6 μL of 0.5 M CaCl2 was added to yield
a final concentration of 0 or 1 mM Ca2+. For chain-growth
hydrogels, DTT was not added. Chemically cross-linked hydrogels were
obtained by exposing the precursor solution to UV light (15 W, 365
nm, UVP, Upland, CA) for 10 min. Both chain-growth and mixed-model
solutions were degassed before cross-linking.

2.5 Compressive
Modulus
The compressive
modulus for each experimental condition was obtained through manual
compression measurements. Obtained hydrogel pegs (n = 3) approximately 15 × 15 × 6 mm3 were placed
between two microscope slides and measured as weight was added. A
stress–strain curve was created using distances between the
microscope slides measured through Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The
linear regions of the curve under 5–15% strain were used to
report the compressive moduli.

2.6 Swelling
Ratio
The swelling ratio
was measured for the hydrogels in DI water. Each experimental condition
was tested at a concentration of 1% w/v modified gellan gum. The obtained
hydrogels weighed (w0). The hydrogels
were subsequently immersed in DI water until equilibrium was reached
and weighed (ws). The wet swelling ratio
(S) was calculated using eq 2. 2  

2.7 In Vitro Degradation Profile
The
effect of the different cross-linking mechanisms on the degradation
profiles of LMGG and HMGG hydrogels was examined. Hydrogels (n = 3) were immersed in 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme and phosphate
buffered saline (PBS, diluted from 10× solution to 0.1 M, pH
7.4, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and weighed daily.

2.8 Cell Culture
NIH/3T3 fibroblasts
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in complete medium (CM, Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum,
100 U/L penicillin, and 100 μg/L streptomycin) at 37 °C
in 5% CO2. The cells were passaged every 3–5 days
using 0.025% trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Mediatech,
Tewksbury, MA) detachment and subcultured at 6.7 × 103 cells/cm2.

2.9 Cell Proliferation
Cell proliferation
was tested on all gelation formulations for both LMGG and HMGG. A
solution of 10 mg/mL LMGG or HMGG in CM was prepared at 37 °C.
Solutions for the mixed and chain-growth gelation procedures were
degassed for 15 min. To each well, 100 μL of each modified gellan
gum solution was added to 48-well plates (KSE Scientific, Durham NC).
The hydrogels were exposed to UV light for 10 min. Cells were seeded
at a concentration of 1.25 × 105 cells/cm2 on each modified gellan gum hydrogel and 200 μL CM
without phenol red was added the plate was incubated for 48 h. Live
and dead controls were generated by culturing cells without the gel.
After 48 h, the dead control supernatant was aspirated and replaced
with 95% ethanol for 10 min. After this incubation period, the supernatant
in each well was aspirated. To each well, 150 μL of working
solution (2 μM calcein AM (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA) and 7.5 μM
7-aminoactinomycin D (Tonbo Biosciences, San Diego, CA) in PBS) was
added and the plates were incubated to 30–40 min at 37 °C
in 5% CO2. The live cells were quantified using an excitation/emission
of 485/590 nm. The dead cells were measured using an excitation/emission
of 528/645 nm using a plate reader (BioTek Synergy HT Multidetection
Microplate Rreader BioTek, Winooski, VT).

Cells stained using
the live/dead assay were imaged using an EVOS FLoid Imaging Station
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) using the red channel (excitation/emission
586/646 nm) and the green channel (482/532 nm).

2.10 Statistics and Data Analysis
Statistical
analysis was performed using JMP statistical software (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC). Statistical significance of the mean comparisons
was determined by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pair-wise
comparisons were analyzed with Tukey’s honest significance
difference test. Differences were considered statistically significant
for p < 0.05.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Gellan Gum Modification
and Characterization
Methacrylation of gellan gum is schematically
illustrated in Figure 1A. The NMR spectrum
of methacrylated gellan gum is shown in Figure 1B. The 1H NMR spectra of unmodified
gellan gum (Figure 1B top) and modified gellan gum (Figure 1B middle and bottom) were obtained at 25
°C. All three spectra showed the characteristic methyl peak from
rhamnose (δ = 1.3 ppm). Methacrylation was verified and quantified
by the characteristic carbon–carbon
double bond peaks (δ = 5.7 and 6.2 ppm) and a peak corresponding
to the methyl group on the newly methacrylated moiety (δ = 1.95
ppm). The degree of modification was calculated by comparing the integrated
proton peaks from the methyl group on the methacrylate and the methyl
group on rhamnose. The average number of methacrylate groups per LMGG
repeating unit was 0.5 ± 0.06 (Figure 1B middle), which increased to 2.0 ±
0.11 for HMGG (Figure 1B bottom).

(bottom) gellan gum. (C) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
spectra of gellan gum and low- and high-modified gellan gum.

Methacrylation of gellan gum was
further confirmed by FTIR (Figure 1C). The carbon–carbon
double bond peak is expected to appear at 1640 cm–1, which overlaps with other vibrational modes in the gellan gum.
However, the characteristic peak at 1720 cm–1 corresponding
to the carbonyl present on the methacrylate group appeared after chemical
modification and grew in intensity with increasing degree of methacrylation.

The viscosity average molecular weight of GG as well as modified
GG were also measured (Figure S1). Unmodified
GG has a viscosity average molecular weight of 212.2 ± 21.0 kDa.
LMGG and HMGG were significantly different from unmodified GG (266.1
± 6.78 and 383.7 ± 38.4 kDa, respectively). The increase
in the viscosity average molecular weight after modification was higher
(25.5 ± 8.9% for LMGG and 80.1 ± 15.8% for HMGG) than that
calculated via the degree of methacrylation (4.8% for LMGG and 19%
for HMGG). This likely resulted from the change in the solubility
of the polymer that contributed to the increased viscosity.

The resultant gels are labeled by numbers according to their unique
formula shown under each graph. Gels 1–4 are LMGG gels, whereas
5–14 are HMGG gels.

3.2 Compression Modulus
The compressive
moduli of the 14 different formulations of hydrogels were obtained
by analyzing the stress–strain curves in the region of 5–15%
strain. The modulus of the hydrogels ranged from 6.4 to 17.2 kPa.
A higher degree of methacrylation resulted in more rigid substrates,
with LMGG gels ranging from 6.4 to 11.3 kPa and HMGG gels ranging
from 7.4 to 17.2 kPa (Figure 2). The increased mechanical strength in HMGG was expected
due to a higher degree of modification and cross-linking.

and high-modified gellan gum hydrogels cross-linked through different

The mechanical properties of the gellan gum hydrogels
synthesized
here were altered by three factors: the presence of calcium, the chemical
cross-linking mechanism, and the thiol–ene ratio. We first
explore the effect of physical cross-linking on the mechanical properties
of hydrogels by adding divalent cations. Calcium was found to either
increase or have no significant influence on the compressive moduli
of the gels. LMGG gels were not able to form in the absence of calcium.
For HMGG gels, the addition of calcium had little effect on the hydrogels
cross-linked through mixed model. The hydrogels cross-linked through
the step-growth mechanism of equimolar thiol–ene together with
calcium exhibited an increased compression modulus (9.9 ± 0.6
kPa) compared to their counterparts in the absence of calcium (7.3
± 0.8 kPa). A similar trend was observed when half-molar equivalents
of thiol were added, with the modulus increasing from 9.8 ± 0.7
to 12.8 ± 0.9 kPa. The compressive modulus of the gels formed
using chain-growth cross-linking was also improved through the addition
of calcium (14.6 ± 0.8 to 16.5 ± 1.0 kPa).

Divalent
cations such as calcium form bridges between carboxyl
groups and reduce electrical repulsion, resulting in physical cross-links.20 These junctions allow gellan gum chains to bundle
to form helical structures16 and may increase
the mechanical properties. However, the interaction between calcium
cations with the gellan gum hydroxyl and carboxyl groups reduces the
hydrogen bond donors and acceptors available to interact with water,17 thus the strength between the network and the
water matrix decreased. As a result, the compressive modulus was not
significantly influenced in some hydrogels.

We then investigated
how the cross-linking mechanism influences
the hydrogel stiffness. The results showed that the cross-linking
mechanisms significantly affected the mechanical properties for all
of the gels studied here. For LMGG gels, the compression modulus was
increased from 6.4 ± 0.7 to 8.1 ± 0.7 kPa when the cross-linking
mechanism was changed from step growth to mixed model using equimolar
thiol–ene gels. The same trend was observed for half molar
thiol–ene LMGG gels, where the modulus increased from 9.6 ±
0.7 to 11.3 ± 0.8 kPa. Similarly, for HMGG gels, the compression
modulus increased from 7.4 ± 0.8 to 12.4 ± 0.8 kPa in the
absence of calcium and from 9.9 ± 0.6 to 13.0 ± 0.7 kPa
in its presence for equimolar thiol–ene gels. This trend was
also observed for the half molar thiol–ene hydrogels in which
the compression modulus changes from 9.8 ± 0.7 to 16.4 ±
0.9 kPa in the absence of calcium and from 12.8 ± 0.9 to 17.2
± 0.1 kPa in the presence of calcium. Surprisingly, the chain-growth
cross-linked gels had the highest compression modulus of 14.6 ±
0.8 and 16.5 ± 1.0 kPa in the absence and presence of calcium,
respectively.

The chain-growth hydrogels were cross-linked without
dithiol cross-linkers
and expected to have the lowest cross-linking density and thus the
lowest compression modulus. However, the results showed that chain-growth
hydrogels have the highest compressive modulus among the hydrogels
studied here. Two reasons contribute to the high compression moduli
of chain-growth hydrogels compared with the mixed-model and step-growth
hydrogels in this study. First, homopolymerization of acrylate yields
heterogeneous chains and causes a high degree of chain entanglements,
which contribute to a higher modulus.18 Second, there is a parabolic relationship between the thiol–ene
ratio and the resultant hydrogel shear modulus, with the shear modulus
initially increasing and then decreasing with increasing thiol content.21 The two ratios used here may not be optimal
to yield the highest compressive modulus. The higher modulus for the
chain-growth hydrogels over the step-growth hydrogel has been previously
observed by Lin and co-workers.18 In their
study, the chain-growth methacrylated gelatin had a shear modulus
more than double that of the step-growth norbornene functionalized
gelatin (0.9 vs 0.4 kPa).18

The higher
moduli observed in the mixed-model hydrogels compared
with the step-growth counterparts may result from the oxygen level
in the precursor solutions. The presence of oxygen in the precursor
solutions inhibits radical polymerization and reduces cross-linking
density.22,23 The dissolved oxygen in the mixed-model
hydrogel precursor solutions was reduced via degassing to promote
cross-linking.

The thiol–ene ratio also plays an important
role in modulating
the compressive modulus of the hydrogels. Equimolar thiol–ene
hydrogels were initially expected to yield the highest compression
modulus because each thiol group was expected to react with one vinyl
group and consume all of the available vinyls.24 However, carbon–carbon bonds can homopolymerize,
resulting in excessive thiols, which react to form dangling dithiol
bonds.18,24,25 In addition,
increased dithiol results in increased chain transfer, which terminates
chain propagation and reduces the degree of polymerization.21,26,27 For these reasons, half-molar
thiol–ene hydrogels had higher compressive moduli compared
with equimolar gels. For LMGG hydrogels, the half-molar thiol–ene
gels yielded higher compressive moduli than the equimolar gels for
both step-growth and mixed-model cross-linkings (8.1 ± 0.7 and
11.3 ± 0.8 vs 6.4 ± 0.7 and 9.6 ± 0.7 kPa, respectively).
This trend continued for HMGG gels, with the half-molar thiol–ene
gels having higher moduli than their equimolar counterparts. This
relationship between the thiol content and the cross-linking density
for step-growth and mixed-model gels has been observed previously.21,24 Homopolymerization of norbornene is difficult due to steric hindrance
and was still found to have the highest cross-linking density at a
lower than equimolar thiol–ene ratio.24 Defects in cross-linking such as formation of loops and dangling
structures are believed to be responsible for this phenomenon.25

3.3 Swelling Ratio
The swelling ratio
was measured in DI water as an indirect method for assessing the cross-linking
density, as a high swelling ratio generally corresponds to a low cross-linking
density and vice versa. In this work, the wet swelling ratios of the
14 types of gels (Figure 3) were negatively correlated with the compressive moduli (R = −0.55). The swelling ratios of the gels ranged
from 2.46 ± 0.11 to 4.28 ± 0.14 for LMGG gels and from 0.98
± 0.01 to 1.95 ± 0.34 for HMGG gels. A higher compressive
modulus generally resulted in less water uptake. In addition to the
cross-linking density, the formation of ionic bonds and the hydrophilicity
of the network influence swelling.

Figure 3 Swelling behavior of gellan gum hydrogels.
Hydrogels cross-linked
through different mechanisms were swelled in PBS. Data presented as
mean ± SD. n = 3. Statistical analysis through
two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD post hoc test. Bars with the
same letter (A–J) are not statistically different (p < 0.05).

Calcium ions not only form ionic bonds that increase the
cross-linking
density and lower the swelling ratio but also reduce water uptake.
Because all LMGG hydrogels were strengthened with calcium, this discussion
will focus on HMGG hydrogels. The influence of calcium on the swelling
ratio was significant for thiol cross-linked gels. For equimolar thiol–ene
ratio hydrogels, the swelling ratio of the step-growth gels decreased
from 1.94 ± 0.34 to 1.29 ± 0.058 when calcium was added.
Similar decreases in the swelling ratio were observed for equimolar
mixed-model hydrogels when calcium was added (1.73 ± 0.13 to
1.26 ± 0.035). This trend continued for half-molar thiol–ene
gels formed through step-growth cross-linking (1.57 ± 0.033 in
the absence and 1.07 ± 0.030 in the presence of calcium) and
mixed-model cross-linking (1.46 ± 0.031 in the absence and 1.09
± 0.044 in the presence of calcium). Chain-growth gels, on the
other hand, did not have significant differences with or without calcium
(0.98 ± 0.009 and 1.1 ± 0.030, respectively). This could
be caused by the rigid network of chain-growth cross-links, which
may have reduced the effect of the calcium physical cross-links.28

An interesting finding regarding the swelling
measurements was
on the mixed-mode hydrogels. Those hydrogels had similar compression
moduli with or without the addition of calcium, thus they were expected
to have similar cross-linking densities and swelling ratios. However,
mixed-mode hydrogels with calcium had a lower water uptake when compared
to their counterparts without calcium. This phenomenon was caused
by multiple mechanisms regarding how ionic bonds can influence the
swelling ratio. First, the formation of ionic bonds increases the
cross-linking density and reduces the swelling capacity.4 Second, interactions between the carboxylic acids
on gellan gum and calcium cations decrease the available hydrogen
bond donors and acceptors available for interaction with water,17 thus decreasing the amount of water associated
with the hydrogel network. Third, compared with covalently cross-linked
polymeric networks, ionic bonds are less flexible, which reduces their
ability to swell.29

All LMGG gels
showed significantly higher swelling ratios compared
to HMGG gels and all LMGG gels were strengthened with ionic cross-links.
For LMGG gels, the compressive modulus was negatively correlated with
the swelling ratio (R = −0.97). Hydrophilicity
affects the swelling response of hydrogels, with hydrophilic networks
taking up more water.30 LMGG has one methacrylate
group on every two tetrasaccharide repeating unit, whereas HMGG has
two methacrylates on each repeating unit. This suggests that LMGG
will have a stronger affinity for water than HMGG.

The swelling
ratio of gellan gum hydrogels cross-linked via chain-growth
polymerization has been studied previously. The dual cross-linked
gellan gum hydrogel (chain-growth and ionic cross-linking) exhibited
significantly lower swelling ratios (∼100% of original weight),
which is similar to our results.4 The same
group also investigated the gellan gum swelling behavior in PBS. The
dual cross-linked gellan gum hydrogels shrank when immersed in PBS
solution due to the formation of helical structures and cross-links.4 Reis and co-workers found 2500% water uptake
in photo-cross-linked gellan gum hydrogel in PBS after 30 days.9 The same group further investigated and compared
water uptake in photo-cross-linked and ionically cross-linked gellan
gum hydrogels, where both showed ∼2500% water uptake after
90 days.10 However, the swelling ratios
of gellan gum hydrogels in both DI water and PBS were highly dependent
on the degree of methacrylation and the final concentration of the
cations. Due to this reason, our results here cannot be directly compared
with the literature.

3.4 In Vitro Degradation
Lysozyme, an
antibacterial enzyme released by macrophages during the wound-healing
process,31 breaks down the cell walls of
bacteria and releases N-acetyl-d-glucosamine.32 Previous studies have shown that polysaccharides
can undergo enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of lysozyme.11,33−36 It is believed that lysozyme breaks ether bonds connecting the structural
backbone of the polysaccharide.37 The in
vitro degradation profile of hydrogels in this study was obtained
by exposing the hydrogels to PBS or 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme (Figure 4). The hydrogels immersed in
pH 7.4 PBS were stable, with 80% mass remaining after 42 days (Figure 4A). This weight loss
likely results from the dehydration of the gel, as the ionic concentration
of the PBS solution is higher than that in the hydrogels.11 In lysozyme, all of the gels degraded to 20%
of their initial weight after 16 days (Figure 4B), with HMGG gels degrading slightly faster
than LMGG gels. The differences in the degradation rates for LMGG
and HMGG hydrogels may result from differences in network hydrophilicity.
The HMGG backbone contains more hydrophobic methacrylate groups than
LMGG. These methacrylate groups can form hydrophobic kinetic chains
during cross-linking,23,38 which may retard the diffusion
of lysozyme solution into the hydrogel.

Figure 4 Gellan gum hydrogel degradation.
Hydrogels formed through different
cross-linking methods were immersed in (A) PBS and (B) 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme
at 37°C. Data presented as mean ± SD. n = 3.

The stability of gellan gum hydrogels
in PBS has been confirmed
through several studies. Reis and co-workers immersed the gellan gum
hydrogel for 30 days in PBS, and the hydrogels showed less than 20%
weight loss.9 In a later study, the same
group conducted a PBS stability test for both ionic cross-linked and
photo-cross-linked gellan gum gels up to 90 days, which resulted in
nearly 20% weight loss.10 The stability
of another polysaccharide, chitosan, in PBS was also found to retain
80% of its original weight after 18 days,11 which is in line with our findings.

The degradation rate of
polysaccharide hydrogels in lysozyme is
highly dependent on both concentration of lysozyme and the type of
polysaccharide. The photo-cross-linked chitosan hydrogels were found
to completely disintegrated in 1 mg/mL lysozyme after 8 days.11 Methacrylated chitin hydrogels retained 50%
of their original weight after 60 h in 1 mg/mL lysozyme, but completely
degraded in 50 mg/mL lysozyme within 10 h.39 The density of cross-links in the methacrylated chitin gels also
alters the degradation rate, with a higher cross-linking density leading
to a slower degradation rate.39 These results
combined with the observations in our study provide cues for controlling
the degradation rates for future applications using hydrogels as tissue
engineering scaffolds.

3.5 Cell Proliferation
Fibroblasts are
key players in both physiological repair of tissues after injury and
in maintaining skin homeostasis.40,41 They are recruited
to the wound site 2–10 days after injury and differentiate
into myofibroblast.42 The differentiation
of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts was found to be sensitive to substrate
stiffness.43 Myofibroblasts are contractile
cells that bring wound edges together and deposit and remodel the
ECM.42 Therefore, the interaction between
hydrogels, which are used to mimic native ECM, and fibroblasts is
important in designing tissue engineering scaffolds.

The cell
proliferation of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts seeded on 14 various substrates
was visualized by live/dead fluorescence staining (Figure 5A). No dead cells were observed
for any of the hydrogels. All LMGG hydrogels and the chain-growth
HMGG hydrogels showed the highest cell proliferation. LMGG mixed-model
gels showed lower cell proliferation than LMGG step-growth gels. Cell
proliferation on HMGG hydrogels was well correlated with the hydrogel
compressive modulus (R = 0.80). The softest HMGG
gels—those formed using equimolar thiol–ene ratios—yielded
the lowest cell proliferation (4.6 ± 0.5% in the absence and
5.7 ± 0.4% in the presence of calcium). The stiffest HMGG substrates—those
formed through chain-growth cross-linking—had the highest cell
proliferation (46.5 ± 5.7% in the absence and 52.9 ± 5.8
in the presence of calcium).

two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD post hoc test. Bars with the
same letter (A–G) are not statistically different (p < 0.05).

Mechanical signals play an important role in myofibroblast
differentiation,
activation, and adhesion.44 Fibroblasts
differentiate into a contractile myofibroblast phenotype when exposed
to substrates with elastic moduli corresponding to pathologically
stiff fibrotic tissue with microfilament bundles or mature focal adhesions,45 whereas those cultured on softer substrates
show little development of stress fibers.43,46 Fluorescent images of cells stained with a live-dead assay were
used to visualize cell morphology. Here, fibroblasts seeded on the
stiffest hydrogel (gel 5) had some stress fibers and microfilament
bundles (Figure 5A).
The cells seeded on softer substrates (gels 9 and 11) formed clusters
of cells that did not spread on the surfaces. Conversely, the cells
seeded on stiffer hydrogels (gels 12 and 13) spread more evenly across
the surface of the gel.

In addition to mechanical stress, the
surface chemistry can influence
fibroblast morphology and differentiation. As shown in Figure 5, the fibroblasts cultured
on half-molar thiol–ene step-growth HMGG hydrogels in the absence
of calcium showed microfilament bundles even though the gel was softer
than the similarly formed chain-growth gel 6. Microfilament bundles
were only observed on the substrates fabricated with half-molar thiol–ene
ratios. These microfilaments disappeared when the modulus of gel 11
was increased via either more chemical cross-linking (gel 12) or ionic
cross-linking (gel 13).

Several studies have demonstrated that
cell adhesion, spreading,
and proliferation depend on the surface chemistry, topology, and wettability.47−54 Combinatorial approaches for developing nonfouling biomaterials
have revealed that chemistry plays a role in cell activation55 and mitigating the foreign body response.56 A multiarm poly(ethylene glycol)–norbornene
macromer was developed via step-growth method, and the resultant thiol–ene
hydrogel contained more homogeneous networks. Encapsulated MIN6 β-cells
had significantly higher proliferation in the hydrogel formed with
thiol–ene chemistry. Additionally, the encapsulated cells in
the thiol–ene hydrogels grew in clusters.57 Here, the effect of the thiol content was found to be the
major parameter responsible for fibroblast morphology differences.
Cell behavior in relation to the thiol–ene group has not been
studied extensively. More experiments are necessary to decouple the
effect of surface chemistry and mechanical properties on fibroblast
differentiation and morphology.

Cell responses and proliferation
on biomaterial surfaces are crucial
to biomedical applications and tissue engineering. No dead cells were
observed for any of the hydrogels fabricated here. Cell proliferation
data indicate that both LMGG and HMGG hydrogels are biocompatible
and bioactive. In addition, cell proliferation of HMGG was controlled,
in part, by the tunable mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The
design principles of tissue engineering constructs greatly depend
on the native mechanical properties of the organ in which the biomaterial
will be implanted. Owing to their range of compressive moduli (6.4–17.2
kPa), the gellan gum hydrogels fabricated here have the potential
to be used as dermal implants. During the wound-healing process, fibroblasts
differentiate into myofibroblasts and deposit newly synthesized ECM
2 weeks after injury.58 Cell proliferation,
activation of growth factors, and mechanics of ECM are the known contributors
to fibrosis.59 A higher elastic moduli
(16–20 kPa) of granulation tissue during the repairing stage
leads to a significantly higher level of fibroblast differentiation.60 Skin stiffness changes during the proliferation
and regenerative stages and becomes stiffer in fibrotic tissue (∼50
kPa). Thus, a soft tissue scaffold for dermal should be in a relatively
lower range of 1–20 kPa.60 Our hydrogels
have the potential to be applied as biologically active wound dressings
and mimic the mechanical properties and microenvironment of the ECM.

4 Conclusions
We successfully modified gellan
gum by reacting it with methacrylic
anhydride. Both low-modified and high-modified gellan gum hydrogels
were synthesized by varying the amount of methacrylic anhydride. Taking
advantage of the thiol–ene click chemistry, the hydrogels were
fabricated through chain-growth, step-growth, and mixed-model mechanisms.
We demonstrated that the addition of calcium and thiol–ene
ratio can significantly alter the compressive modulus of the resultant
hydrogels. The swelling ratios of hydrogels were negatively correlated
with hydrogel compression modulus. The formation of physical cross-links
through the addition of calcium reduced the network flexibility and
suppressed the hydrogel swelling. NIH/3T3 fibroblasts proliferated
on the hydrogels and had a positive correlation with substrate stiffness.
Cell morphology and spreading were found to be related to substrate
chemistry. In general, the addition of calcium, an optimized thiol–ene
ratio, and mixed-mode cross-linking mechanisms can yield stiffer hydrogels,
which are related to increased fibroblast proliferation. Over all,
this study demonstrated the ability to tune the mechanical properties
of gellan gum hydrogels through the chemical modification and the
addition of divalent ions. The data presented here will help build
a gellan gum platform for future applications in tissue engineering.
