GaSb is one of the
most suitable semiconductors for optoelectronic
devices operating in the mid-infrared range. However, the existence
of GaSb surface states has dramatically limited the performance of
these devices. Herein, a controllable nitrogen passivation approach
is proposed for GaSb. The surface states and optical properties of
GaSb were found to depend on the N passivation conditions. Varying
the plasma power during passivation modified the chemical bonds of
the GaSb surface, which influenced the emission efficiency. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy was used to quantitatively demonstrate
that the GaSb oxide layer was removed via treatment at a plasma power
of 100 W. After nitrogen passivation, the samples exhibited enhanced
emission. Free exciton emission was the main factor leading to this
enhanced luminescence. An energy band model for the surface states
is used to explain the carrier radiative recombination processes.
This nitrogen passivation approach can suppress surface states and
improve the surface quality of GaSb-based materials and devices. The
enhancement in exciton-related emission by this simple approach is
important for improving the performance of GaSb-based optoelectronic
devices.

1 Introduction
The
superficial and interfacial characteristics are important for
the performance of advanced semiconductor devices, which are gaining
increasing interest in optoelectronics.1−5 Surface states are generally induced by the rebonding of surface
dangling bonds (such as forming surface oxides) and surface contamination
(such as the adsorption of gas molecules).6,7 The
presence of these surface states leads to poor photoelectric efficiency
of these devices, so the passivation of surface states has become
an important research focus for practical applications. Investigations
of surface passivation have been intensively carried out for traditional
semiconductors such as II–VI and III–V materials and
for more modern materials such as two-dimensional and perovskite materials.3,8−14 These studies have shown that the properties of semiconductors and
the performances of devices can be improved by optimizing the surface
passivation.

III–V materials possess highly reactive
surfaces and a high
amount of dangling bonds, so they exhibit a high density of surface
states.15−18 This is especially true for GaSb. The performance of GaSb-based
devices is suppressed by the presence of surface states,19,20 which limit the application of GaSb-based devices. Much effort has
been focused on reducing the surface states of GaSb. These have included
incorporating interfacial or capping layers composed of wide band
gap materials, wet chemistry modification approaches, in situ hydrogen
plasma treatment, and the deposition of high-k dielectrics.19,21−23 Sulfur (S) passivation has long been recognized as
a useful method for removing surface states.24,25 By adjusting the treatment conditions, the oxide layer and surface
dangling bonds can be effectively etched or filled.26−28 Unfortunately,
these solution-based processing techniques still leave some residual
oxides and can further degrade the structural quality of the materials.
To overcome this, H2S predeposition annealing has been
proposed, which can provide solid S passivation with strong resistance
to oxidation, compared with (NH4)2S solution
treatment.29−31

Like S, nitrogen (N) should also be a suitable
candidate for passivation.
N is more electronegative (3.08) than S (2.58), so it should be able
to more effectively fill surface dangling bonds. Guo et al.32 proposed N substitution at the high-k/GaAs interface for minimizing interfacial diffusion and
defect states. Alekseev et al. demonstrated that N2H4·H2O wet chemistry passivation could reduce
the surface state density of GaAs nanowires.33 N passivation is also effective for overcoming problems associated
with surface states in InP-based materials.

In the present study,
the N passivation of GaSb based on plasma-enhanced
atomic layer deposition (PEALD) is proposed and realized. Controllable
N passivation consisting of atomic layer etching and N bonding processes
is achieved during PEALD, using NH3 as an N source. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to demonstrate that the removal
of surface states depends on the power of the N plasma. The influence
of N passivation on the luminescence mechanism is discussed, based
on the results of photoluminescence (PL) measurements.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows room-temperature
PL spectra of the GaSb samples with and without N passivation. The
emission at approximately 1714 nm was assigned to the near band gap
emission (NBE) of GaSb.34 After N passivation,
the emission intensity of the samples changed significantly. For example,
the emission intensity of sample 1 was approximately three times higher
than that of the as-grown GaSb. The factor of emission enhancement
was sensitive to the power of the N plasma, as shown in the inset
in Figure 1. Figure S1 shows normalized PL spectra. The full-width
at half-maximum values of the emissions of the four samples were all
50 meV. This implied that the samples possessed the same emission
mechanism.35 In addition, the etching cycle
can also affect the emission intensity; Figure S2 indicates the relationship between emission intensity and
etching cycles. When the power of the plasma was 100 W, the optimum
etching period is 200 cycles.

Figure 1 PL spectra of the samples measured at 300 K.
The inset shows the
integrated intensities of the samples.

The results of the room-temperature PL measurements indicated
that
N passivation was beneficial for improving the emission efficiency.
GaSb has a highly reactive surface and can be easily oxidized at room
temperature through the spontaneous reactions of 2GaSb + 3O2 → Ga2O3 + Sb2O3 and 2GaSb + Sb2O3 → Ga2O3 + 4Sb.36,37 Therefore, the existence of Ga
and Sb oxides can be indicators for the surface states. The enhanced
emission observed in the experimental data indicated a change in surface
states. To support this claim, the chemical compositions of the N
plasma-treated samples were investigated by XPS. Figure 2 shows the XPS spectra of the
Ga (3d) and Sb (3d) regions for the samples. In the Ga (3d) XPS spectra
in Figure 2a, the peaks
at 20.7, 20.35, 19.8, 19.2, and 18.9 eV could be indexed to Ga–O
bonds in Ga2O3 and Ga2O, Ga–N
bonds, Ga–Sb bonds, and Ga–Ga bonds, respectively.38−41 Ga–O and Ga–Sb bonds were observed in the XPS spectrum
of the as-grown GaSb sample because of the native oxide layer covering
the GaSb surface.38,39,42 After N passivation, XPS peaks characteristic of Ga–O bonds
in GaxOy were
not observed, which indicated the complete removal of the surface
oxide. The disappearance of XPS peaks of Ga–O bonds correlated
with the emergence of peaks of Ga–N bonds at 19.8 eV in the
XPS spectra of all N passivated samples. This indicated that N plasma
treatment broke the Ga–O bonds in Ga2O3 and Ga2O and replaced them with Ga–N bonds.39,40 At a higher plasma power of 200 W (sample 2), in addition to Ga–N
bonds, a peak was observed at 18.9 eV, which could be assigned to
Ga–Ga bonds, whereas the intensity of the Ga–Sb bond
decreased. Increasing the plasma power to 300 W (sample 3) caused
the intensity of the peak of Ga–Ga bonds to increase. The presence
of Ga–Ga bonds suggested that Ga clusters were formed at the
surface of GaSb.16,41,42Figure 2b shows the
Sb (3d) XPS spectra of the samples. In the spectrum of the as-grown
GaSb sample, peaks characteristic of Sb–O, Sb–Sb, and
Sb–Ga bonds were observed at 540.1, 537.8, and 537.1 eV, respectively.16,28,38,39,43 These peaks arose from the presence of the
surface oxide, Sb clusters existing between the interface of the surface
oxide and GaSb substrate, and the GaSb substrate, respectively.19,36,37 After N passivation (100 W),
peaks of Sb–O bonds and Sb–Sb bonds disappeared from
the XPS spectra, and peaks of Sb–N bonds at 539.7 eV were observed.44 However, increasing the plasma power to 200
or 300 W again resulted in the emergence of peaks of Sb–Sb
bonds which were related to Sb clusters. These results indicated the
decomposition of the oxide layer and the formation of N-related bonds.
The observation of Ga and Sb clusters indicated that excess plasma
power harmed the GaSb surface and caused surface defects. Thus, the
XPS results suggested that N passivation could suppress surface states
and that an appropriate plasma power during the PEALD process was
essential.

samples.

To explain the increase in NBE
and the underlying physical mechanism,
low-temperature and temperature-dependent PL measurements were carried
out. Figure 3a shows
the PL emission of the samples at 20 K. Six PL emission peaks were
detected in all samples. According to the characteristic energies
of excitonic emission,45−47 the exciton emission peaks at 0.802 and 0.81 eV can
be assigned to free exciton A (FX-a) and free exciton B (FX-b), respectively.
The other emission peaks can be assigned to bound exciton emission
(BE, 0.795 eV), the native acceptor (A, 0.778 eV) level from the conduction
band to the acceptor (BA), or donor–acceptor pair transitions,
the acceptor transition (B, 0.758 eV) related to the complex VGaGaSbVGa,47 and the first-order phonon replica of the native acceptor (A-LO,
0.749 eV).47,48 The FX-related emission of sample
1 was the highest of all samples. Figure 3b,c shows atomic force microscope (AFM) images
of the as-grown GaSb sample and sample 1, respectively. The white
raised particles on surface of the GaSb sample were considered to
be the native oxide on the GaSb substrate. The surface roughness measurement
(RMS) of the GaSb sample was 0.811 nm. N passivation removed the native
oxide, so the surface of sample 1 was smoother (RMS of 0.502 nm).
The samples exhibited different surface morphologies in the AFM images
in Figure S3, thus the surface of GaSb
was sensitive to the power of the N plasma.

Figure 3 (a) Low-temperature PL
spectra of the samples (20 K), and AFM images
of the (b) as-grown GaSb sample and (c) sample 1.

The as-grown GaSb sample and sample 1 exhibited differing
results
in both low-temperature PL measurements and AFM observations. Thus,
these two samples were further investigated to better understand the
origin of the FX emission and the relationship among FX, BE, and A.
Temperature-dependent PL measurements were carried out on the as-grown
GaSb sample and sample 1 from 20 to 200 K, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. For the GaSb sample, increasing the temperature led
to gradual red shifts and decreases in the intensities of the emissions
of FX, BE, and A. The low-temperature (20 K) PL spectrum could be
well-fitted by five individual Gaussian peaks, as shown in Figure 4b. The emission of
peak A was dominant, but its intensity decreased faster than those
of the other emissions. When the temperature increased to 160 K, the
emission of A became totally quenched, as shown in Figure 4a. Figure 4c shows the peak positions of FX, BE, and
A, as a function of temperature. The photon energies of these emissions
could be well-fitted by the Varshni empirical equation: E(T) = E0 – αT2/(T + β).49 As the temperature increased, the bound excitons
had sufficient thermal energy to dissociate and become free excitons,
similar to the phenomena in other semiconductors.50 Thus, the emission of the as-grown GaSb sample was dominated
by FX at 200 K. Figure 5 shows the temperature-dependent PL spectra of sample 1. Compared
with the as-grown GaSb sample, as well as the enhanced FX-a emission,
FX-b emission was also observed, as shown in Figure 5b. The intensities of the FX, BE, and A emissions
decreased continuously with the increasing temperature. However, the
emission of A was quenched at 180 K, as shown in Figure 5a. The trends in the temperature-dependent
emission peaks were the same as those for the as-grown GaSb sample.
At higher temperature, the emission of sample 1 was also dominated
by FX, as shown in Figure 5c.

peak positions of the three emission bands of the as-grown GaSb sample.

emission bands of sample 1.

Figure 6 shows
energy
band diagrams which better illustrate the physical mechanism of the
improved NBE after N passivation. In this experiment, the undoped
GaSb substrate was a p-type semiconductor because of its intrinsic
defects, and its Fermi energy level was located at higher energy than
that of the valence band. The surface states can create a space charge
region and strong surface band downward bending because of Fermi energy
level pinning. Consequently, photogenerated electron–hole pairs
will be separated. Subsequently, the number of excitons and thus the
intensity of exciton-related emission will reduce, as shown in Figure 6a. Figure 6b shows that surface states
are suppressed by N passivation, thereby shortening the space charge
region. The number of excitons and thus the intensity of exciton-related
emission would increase, such as FX. This is consistent with previous
reports.50,51 However, the passivation greatly depends
on the plasma power. Surface treatment at excess plasma power leads
to surface defects such as Ga and Sb clusters and induces many nonradiative
recombination centers. Thus, varying the plasma power can tune the
surface states and influence the emission efficiency.

N passivation.

3 Conclusions
GaSb substrates were treated by N plasma in a PEALD process, in
which the plasma power was varied between 100 and 300 W. The morphology
and optical properties of the samples were investigated. It was confirmed
that surface states related to the surface oxide layer were removed
by N plasma treatment. An optimal plasma power of 100 W was beneficial
for reducing the density of surface states, which could alter the
surface chemical bonding and enhance the emission from GaSb. Excess
plasma power caused the formation of Ga or Sb clusters, which reintroduced
and/or increased the amount of surface defects. N plasma treatment
induced FX emission. Low-temperature and temperature-dependent PL
measurements demonstrated that the FX emission was the cause of the
enhanced PL. N plasma treatment is therefore an effective method for
restraining surface states, to improve the performance of GaSb-based
materials and devices.

4 Experimental Section
A GaSb substrate was used for the passivation experiment; the lattice
orientation of GaSb was (400). The N passivation of GaSb samples was
performed during PEALD (LabNano PE plasma/thermal ALD—Ensure
Nanotech, Beijing, P. R. China). During the passivation process, high-purity
ammonia (NH3) was used as the nitrogen source, and the
number of etching cycles was fixed at 100, 200, 300, or 400. The power
of the plasma generator was set at 100, 200, or 300 W. Prior to N
passivation, the GaSb samples were washed with deionized water to
remove impurities from their surfaces. Samples 1, 2, and 3 were obtained
using plasma powers of 100, 200, and 300 W, respectively. For comparison,
an undoped GaSb substrate was also prepared for use as a reference
sample.

The morphologies of the samples were characterized using
a Multimode
8 AFM. For PL measurements, the PL emission was dispersed by a HORIBA
iHR550 spectrometer and subsequently detected by an InGaAs detector.
During PL measurements, a semiconductor diode laser with a wavelength
of 655 nm was used as the excitation source. A standard phase lock-in
amplifier technique was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.
The excitation power was fixed at 80 mW, and the spot area of the
laser was approximately 0.4 cm2 during the temperature-dependent
PL measurements. To evaluate the changes in the GaSb surface composition
after N plasma exposure, XPS measurements were obtained using a Thermo
Scientific K-Alpha instrument, with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1468.60 eV) as the X-ray source. All XPS spectra
were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
