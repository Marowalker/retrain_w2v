Active palladium colloids formed
upon degradation of a palladacyclic
complex (Herrmann–Beller 1) have been isolated
for the first time and thoroughly characterized with techniques such
as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine
structure spectroscopy. The synthesized palladium colloids have been
utilized as efficient catalysts for the oxidative homocoupling of
aryl boronic acids. Cross-coupling of two different aryl boronic acids
has also been made possible using these active palladium colloids.
This is the first report of this kind of coupling between aryl boronic
acids.

Introduction
In the quest for developing highly efficient
and robust Pd-based
catalysts for C–C bond formation via cross-coupling reactions,1 palladacycles have played a significant role
and, in recent years, found
a wide variety of applications, ranging from catalysts2 for cross-coupling and related reactions to their more
recent application as anticancer agents.3 Early examples for the use of palladacyclic complexes in catalysis
employed azobenzene and hydrazobenzene as coordinating ligands, finding
applications in processes such as selective reduction of alkenes,
alkynes, or nitroalkanes.4

Over the
years, with the increasing demand for more robust, air-stable,
and catalytically active catalysts for addressing synthetically challenging
processes, palladacyclic complexes have come forth as a possible solution.
Since the reports by Herrmann and Beller (the Herrmann–Beller
complex is henceforth referred to as palladacycle 1)
of a highly active palladacyclic complex formed by the reaction of
Pd(OAc)2 and P(o-Tol)3, an exponential growth
in examples related to their use in cross-coupling reactions has been
observed.5 Although the reactivity exhibited
by the palladacycles has been exceptional, the current challenge is
to apply them toward solving more important synthetic problems.

Although the synthetic utility of palladacycles has been well explored,
for many years, the unique reactivity profile of these catalytic systems
was attributed to the presence of either the Pd(II)/Pd(IV)5a,6 or Pd(0)/Pd(II)7 catalytic cycle. However,
the noteworthy work by Jutand and co-workers8 needs a special mention in this regard, providing useful insight
into the possible mechanistic intermediates in these processes.

Another proposal that has gained lot of interest in recent years
is the possibility of palladacycles acting as reservoirs for Pd(0).9 However, one of the strongest
arguments to date, based on experimental evidence, is about the presence
of soluble palladium colloids/nanoparticles.10 Loss of activity for an
immobilized palladacyclic catalyst by Nowotny,11a along with the observation of induction period in the catalytic
reaction followed by sigmoidal kinetic profile by Beletskaya and co-workers,11b has offered support for such assumptions. Several
others have also provided evidence to highlight nanoparticular/colloidal
involvement, notably, Gladysz and co-workers,11c,11d through their report on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmation
of Pd colloids. These initial reports on the presence of Pd nanoparticles/colloids
brought about a flurry of activity, leading to the development of
palladacyclic complexes, which could act as sources of highly active
palladium colloids. Accordingly, a recent review by Alonso and Najera12 elegantly highlights the advantages and applicability
of oxime-derived palladacycles as sources of active palladium colloids/nanoparticles.

Besides these reports, pioneering work by Dupont on the kinetic
and mechanistic aspects of the Heck reaction using the palladacycle
{Pd[κ1-C, κ1-N-Cd(C6H5)C(Cl)CH2NMe2](μ-Cl)}2 has also revealed the presence of highly active Pd(0) colloids.13 The presence of Pd colloids was confirmed by
performing catalyst-poisoning studies, TEM analysis, and time-resolved
ultraviolet–visible analysis.

Although these studies
have provided evidence based on TEM, mass
spectroscopy (MS), and sometimes extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) analysis of the catalytic solutions,14 no data to date has been presented on the isolation of colloids
as well as their applications. To address this gap in the literature,
we present herein the isolation of highly active palladium colloids/nanoparticles
stabilized on carbon, formed through the degradation of palladacycle 1. Support for the formation of colloids has been provided
using techniques such as TEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and EXAFS. The isolated
palladium colloids have demonstrated excellent activity in the oxidative
homocoupling and cross-coupling of aryl boronic acids.

Results and Discussion
Our interest in exploring the possibility of conversion of palladacycles
to active colloids came about as a part of our studies on the application
of Herrmann–Beller palladacycle 1 for diarylmethanol
synthesis. Most of these processes are catalyzed by transition metals,
namely, Fe, Cu, Ti, Rh, and Pd, with the latter showing enhanced reactivity.15,16 Our study on diarylmethanol synthesis from palladacycle 1 was initiated by performing a screening study for the reaction of
an aryl aldehyde with aryl boronic acid using different catalyst systems
in PhMe (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Screening Study for Diarylmethanol Synthesis
Although, the best results were obtained on changing the
solvent
from PhMe to CH3CN/H2O (for a complete screening
study, see the Supporting Information).
In all cases, a catalytic amount of CHCl3 was added, in
line with recent reports on the beneficial effects of its addition
through activation of the Pd-catalyst toward such types of reactions.17 Chloroform when used as the solvent also gave
comparable yields (86%) to those of CH3CN/H2O, and it could also be used as the reaction solvent.

To assess
the applicability of the developed protocol, a scope
study was undertaken using palladacycle 1 in the CH3CN/H2O solvent system at 80 °C (Scheme 2). First, we investigated the
effect of electronics on the aryl aldehyde
on the catalytic reaction. Electron-accepting substituents favored
arylation of the corresponding aryl aldehyde, smoothly furnishing
the desired products in good yields (4a–d; Scheme 2). Interestingly,
electron-releasing substituents led to complete reduction of product
formation, possibly due to the poor reactivity of the respective aldehydes.
In contrast, employing a variety of differently substituted aryl boronic
acids proved to be beneficial in obtaining good yields of diarylmethanols
(4e–j; Scheme 2).

Colloidal/Nanoparticular Pathway Investigation
While
following the catalytic reactions, it was observed that in almost
all cases black particulate matter was formed, pointing toward the
possible formation of palladium colloids/nanoparticles. To investigate
this further, we performed a series of catalyst-poisoning experiments.

The first of this series was an experiment that is popular and
was commonly employed by Whitesides in the early 80s. It encompasses
poisoning the catalytic solutions with Hg, which results in amalgamation
of the colloidal palladium species.18 To
our excitement, complete inhibition of the catalytic reaction was
observed. This alone cannot be taken as absolute evidence for a nanoparticular
pathway, and further analysis was undertaken to ascertain this assumption.
Carbon disulfide (addition of excess of CS2) has also been
employed as catalyst poison,18b,18c resulting in total
inhibition of the catalytic reaction. The addition of tetrabutylammonium
bromide18c as a nanoparticular stabilizer
gave identical yields of the coupling product.

The Collman test19 has been the method
of choice for detecting the nanoparticular involvement in palladacyclic
systems for the past several years. However, the nonavailability of
polyethyleneglycol-bound benzaldehydes or aryl boronic acids prompted
us to run the Crabtree test instead.20 This
test involves the specific use of a homogeneous species inhibitor,
dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (DCT),
as the catalyst poison. The employment of such a sterically demanding
poison would enable selective inhibition of any homogeneous species
present in the catalytic solution via formation of a strong Pd–DCT
complex, whereas in heterogeneous systems, coordination would be unfavorable.

The Crabtree test was carried out by addition of DCT (2.0 equiv.
with respect to the Pd concentration) to the catalytic reaction 2
h prior to the addition of all substrates. The substrates were then
added, and the reaction was continued for 24 h. On completion of the
reaction, analysis of the catalytic products showed slight inhibition
(39% product obtained), suggesting the possible presence of homogeneous
Pd species or soluble Pd colloids (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 (a) Poison Tests for Confirming the
Nanoparticular or Colloidal Catalyst
and (b) Crabtree Test
All of the above results strongly suggest the presence
of active
palladium nanoparticles or colloids. However, the presence of homotopic
Pd catalysts also cannot be excluded, and further analysis is needed
to ascertain the exact nature of the catalytic species.

TEM Studies
of Catalytic Solution
To ascertain the
involvement of palladium colloids/nanoparticles, a detailed TEM study
was undertaken. This was done by
directly subjecting the general catalytic solution to TEM analysis
after a reaction time of 24 h, represented in Scheme 2, involving the reaction between 4-chlorobenzaldehyde
and phenylboronic acid, by simple deposition of the solution on carbon-coated
copper grids. Palladium colloids approximately 2–4 nm in size
were observed to be present in the catalytic solution (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 (a) TEM image of the
catalytic solution, (b) TEM image of the poly(ethylene)
glycol (PEG)-stabilized colloids. (c) HRTEM image of mercury-engulfed
Pd colloids.

Further confirmation
for the involvement of palladium colloids
was obtained by trapping these colloids in the catalytic reaction
with PEG21 (added at the beginning of the
reaction). Because of the stabilized nature of the colloids, they
appear to be well-dispersed compared with the nonstabilized colloidal
particles. The size of the colloidal particles was found to be in
the approximate range of 3–5 nm (Figure 1b). Similar observations were also made during
the HRTEM analysis of mercury-engulfed Pd colloids obtained after
the mercury drop test. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis clearly indicated
the presence of mercury, with the size of the colloids increasing
up to ∼4.0 nm (Figure 1c).

Isolation and TEM Characterization of Palladium
Colloids
Next, we turned our attention toward the possible
isolation of active
palladium colloids from the catalytic solution. For this to be achieved,
we first tried to find the substrate combination that led to the formation
of active palladium colloids. Experiments were performed with palladacycle 1, used in stoichiometric amounts under different conditions,
which have been summarized in Table 1. Only the combination of palladacycle 1 with 4-chlorobenzaldehyde in CHCl3 and added K2CO3 base at 80 °C resulted in the formation of a
black powder. The solution was then centrifuged to obtain the black
powder, which was washed several times with deionized water and after
suspension in dry ethanol was collected and dried in vacuo (see isolation
reaction in Table 1).

The powder thus obtained was characterized thoroughly
by TEM, HRTEM,
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure 2). TEM analysis of the powder (A) suggested
the average size of colloids to be in the range of 2–4 nm,
which is in good accordance with the values obtained from TEM analysis
of the catalytic solution. To obtain a more precise value for the
size of the colloidal particles, HRTEM analysis was performed on the
powder sample, with image (B) of the palladium colloids indicating
the formation of uniformly distributed spherical structures of ∼2
nm diameter.

Figure 2 (A) TEM image of Pd colloids, (B) HRTEM image of Pd colloids
(∼2
nm diameter), and (C) EDS analysis of Pd colloids.

Confirmation of the presence of Pd colloids was
further obtained
by EDS. The spectra thus recorded allowed the identification of characteristic
Pd lines at Lα1 = 2.838 keV and Lβ1 = 3.03 keV, which are commonly assigned to palladium metal, confirming
the successful formation of the palladium colloids. A closer look
at the EDS spectra also reveals the presence of elemental carbon (Kα
= 0.277), which could possibly be obtained through the degradation
pathway of palladacycle 1 or the aldehyde. Copper lines
are observed as a part of the grid used for the analysis.

To
further strengthen our claim for the presence of Pd colloids
in the catalytic solution, powder XRD analysis was carried out on
the isolated black powder. XRD analysis (Figure 3) revealed the palladium colloids to be present
in a single phase (111 of Bragg reflection), obtained at a 2θ
value of 40. A slight hump in the region of 20–30 (2θ)
also points toward the presence of carbon, although its exact nature
cannot be ascertained at this moment and the employment of high-end
characterization techniques, such as XPS or EXAFS, could help shed
light on this aspect.

Figure 3 Powder XRD analysis of Pd colloids.

XPS and EXAFS Characterization of Pd Colloids
To verify
the observation of carbon, to understand its origin, as well as to
accurately determine the composition of the isolated Pd colloids,
XPS was utilized. The XPS spectral analysis revealed only palladium,
carbon, and oxygen, whereas no phosphorus species were observed, suggesting
the absence of phosphine on the surface of Pd colloids (Figure 4).

Figure 4 X-ray photoelectron spectral
analysis of the synthesized nanoparticles.

The overall composition of the nanoparticular material was
revealed
to be 71.5% C, 22.4% O, and 3.4% Pd. On closer inspection of the palladium
peaks (deconvolution of the peaks), it was observed that Pd is present
as a mixture of PdO (66%), Pd(0) (22%), and PdX2 (halides
possibly coming from the aldehyde).

Next, X-ray absorption near-edge
structure analysis and comparison
of Pd colloids with standards, using the Athena22 program, suggest that the colloids are mostly composed
of Pd(0) species along with some Pd(II) (Figures 5 and 6). The comparison
of Pd(OAc)2 and Pd2(DBA)3 with Pd
foil and palladacycle 1 suggest that E0 for the colloids (24341 eV) lies within the region of
Pd(0) (24350 eV) and Pd(II) (24353.3 eV). Thus, the sample of colloids
can be considered as mixture of Pd (0) and Pd(II). The EXAFS region
of Pd colloids in R-space is similar to that of Pd foil, except that
the amplitude was reduced. This can be attributed to the termination
effect.23 The Fourier transforms (FTs)
of the EXAFS data for the Pd colloids are presented in Figure 7. In the R-space, two main
peaks were observed: one in the range of 1.2–2.0 Å and
the other, more prominent one, in the range of 2.3–2.7 Å.
The latter can be attributed to the Pd–Pd shell. For the former,
it is difficult to distinguish between the Pd–O, Pd–C,
and Pd–P shells in the region of 1.2–2.0 Å. Our
mechanistic investigations from other methods prompted us to use the
oxygen shell for fitting purposes. FT spectra and best fits are represented
in Figure 7.

of Pd compounds and Pd nanoparticles plotted in R-space.

Figure 6 Comparison of Pd compounds and Pd nanoparticles plotted
in energy.

Figure 7 FT spectra for palladium
colloids.

The fitting
of Pd colloids using Pd foil and Pd–O shell of Pd(OAc)2 as theory yielded a good fit, with a residual factor (R-value) of 0.006. During the fitting, the data and theory
were k-weighted and Fourier-transformed using a Hanning
window function in the k-range from 3 to 13 Å–1.

On the basis of the fitting values, it is
fair to assume that the
prior peak around 2.0 Å arises from the Pd–O shell. However,
the possibility of a carbon atom cannot be ruled out at this step.
From the fitting, it was possible to calculate the coordination numbers
with respect to the central Pd atom. It was found that there were
roughly six Pd atoms present around the central Pd at the distance
of about 2.78 ± 0.005 Å. About 1.4 ± 0.5 atoms of oxygen
(or carbon) were also present in the lattice at a distance of 1.97 ±
0.013 Å. FTs of Pd colloids show characteristic signatures of
the Pd foil in the FCC structure, which was used as a reference and
theory for calculation purposes.

The percent composition
of Pd(0)/Pd(II) can be obtained by the calibration method using EXAFS
analysis. However, discussion on such experiments is beyond the scope
of this article. We are currently carrying out detailed studies on
the subjected and will be reporting the results of the same shortly.
Besides the two main peaks mentioned above, an additional peak below
1.2 Å was observed, which mostly comes from background. It was
not possible to completely subtract this peak using AUTOBKG without
affecting the amplitude of the peak for the Pd–Pd shell; hence,
it was left untouched.

All of the above characterization details
have enabled us to predict
with greater certainty the formation of highly active Pd colloids
through the possible degradation/conversion of palladacycle 1. Although this is the first time that the isolation and
complete characterization of colloids has been undertaken, it is still
not clear how or by which pathway the palladacycle degrades/converts
to active colloids.

With the well-characterized active palladium
colloids in hand,
we performed a catalytic reaction to obtain diarylmethanol, to prove
that the same species is responsible for the catalytic activity (Scheme 4). To our excitement,
the catalytic reaction with palladium colloids proceeded smoothly
and furnished the coupled product in comparable yields (4b) in some cases, whereas the catalyst performed better than palladacycle 1 in certain other cases (4c and 4g). On the basis of the composition determined by XPS analysis of
the carbon-stabilized Pd colloids, 10 mg (0.32 mol% of Pd) of the
catalyst was able to efficiently catalyze the transformation at a
relatively lower Pd concentration as compared to palladacycle 1.

Oxidative Homocoupling
of Aryl Boronic Acids
With the
success obtained with the isolated Pd colloids in catalyzing the synthesis
of diarylmethanol, we envisaged their use for tackling a more challenging
synthetic process, oxidative homocoupling of aryl boronic acids. Homocoupling
of aryl boronic acids has proven to be a very useful synthetic methodology
for obtaining symmetrical biaryls, with several reports published
over the last decade detailing the homocoupling of aryl boronic acids
as the most convenient pathway.24,25 Although, this transformation
has been carried out using different metals, palladium-catalyzed oxidative
homocoupling is at the forefront.26,27 Recent advancements
have also highlighted the possibility of performing the catalytic
transformation under base- and ligand-free conditions.28 However, most of these reports have been found
to employ homogeneous catalysts that are difficult to recover, and
the catalyst loadings have also been high.

In this regard, nanoparticular
catalysis29 has provided researchers with
a sustainable alternative in terms of catalyst concentration and recoverability.
However, only a few reports have emerged in the literature on their
application in oxidative homocoupling of aryl boronic acids.30 Among other catalysts, Au nanosized catalysts
have also been employed in recent years. However, the relatively expensive
nature of Au+ and Au3+ salts31 make the protocol synthetically less attractive.32 On closer inspection of the these reports, it
is also evident that the protocols have been restricted to aryl boronic
acids, whereas heteroaryl boronic acids provided poor yields. Similarly,
electron-withdrawing substituents on the aryl boronic acids have proven
to be sluggish substrates for homocoupling in general. With this background,
we envisaged the possibility of employing isolated palladium colloids
as catalysts to address these issues with the homocoupling process.

As a starting point of the study, 3-nitrophenyl boronic acid was
chosen as the substrate and an extensive screening study was performed
(Scheme 5). Initially,
the same conditions as that used for diarylmethanol synthesis were
employed (Scheme 4),
without the addition of aldehyde as the coupling partner (40%). Encouraging
results obtained under the conditions prompted us to explore the reaction
further. Eventually, optimum product formation was observed on employment
of air as the oxidant in the CH3CN/H2O solvent
system at 80 °C. It is to be noted that the removal of CHCl3 (that was added in catalytic amounts for diarylmethanol synthesis)
promoted the homocoupling reaction to proceed efficiently.

Scheme 5 Screening
Studies for Oxidative Homocoupling of Aryl Boronic Acids
However, at this moment, the
exact reason for such an observation
is not known. With these results in hand, palladium-catalyzed oxidative
homocoupling of a wide variety of aryl and heteroaryl boronic acids
was undertaken. From the table given below (Scheme 6), it can be observed that the palladium
colloids are able to catalyze oxidative homocoupling of aryl boronic
acids in very good yields. Electronic effects on the aryl boronic
acids were found to have no effect on the catalytic activity of the
colloids, with electron-withdrawing as well as electron-donating substituted
boronic acids exhibiting comparable results. Heteroaryl boronic acids
when employed as substrates also furnished good yields of the homocoupled
products. Similar observations were made on using challenging, bulkier
aryl boronic acids, with good-to-excellent yields of the homocoupled
products obtained under the catalytic conditions.

Scheme 6 Palladium Colloids
for Oxidative Homocoupling of Aryl Boronic Acids
Interestingly, the more reactive alkyl boronic
acid, cyclohexyl
boronic acid, which is prone to protodeborylation,
also underwent the homocoupling reaction, furnishing dicylohexane
in decent yields. Interestingly, 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid when
subjected to homocoupling conditions furnished a polymeric material,
which is insoluble in most organic solvents (characterization was
not possible). Such a species has been described in the literature
to be formed as a part of the homocoupling process, and it has been
assumed that the material in hand is that reported.33

Another interesting result was obtained during the
oxidative homocoupling
of 2-bromo phenylboronic acid under oxidative coupling conditions
(Scheme 7). The homocoupling
reaction when monitored by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
suggested the formation of three different products, with complete
comparison of the starting boronic acid. Instead of exclusively
furnishing the desired 2,2′-dibromo biphenyl, the coupling
process provided two more products, namely, 2-bromobiphenyl and 1,1′
and 2′,1″-terphenyl in a ratio of 10:30:60 (the possible
pathway for 6c has been represented in Scheme 7). Although, this result reiterates
the active nature of the palladium colloids, its efficiency in catalyzing
a subsequent cross-coupling reaction via C–Br activation could
have further synthetic relevance. The possibility of formation of
products 6a and 6c could be understood from
the proposed mechanism that has been put forth on the basis of some
literature evidence for protodeboronation34 and protodehalogenation35 pathways that
are known to take place during the catalytic processes.

Scheme 7 Oxidative
Homocoupling of 2-Bromophenyl Boronic Acid
Cross-Coupling of Aryl Boronic Acids
The success obtained
with oxidative homocoupling of aryl boronic acids (including electron-poor
substituents) prompted us to further investigate the applicability
of the isolated palladium colloids. Crossed homocoupling of substrates
also provides researchers with an attractive alternative to the general
cross-coupling processes. Success in such processes could be achieved
by the judicious choice of electronically different substrates. However,
to date crossed homocoupling has seldom been reported, given the difficulty
in preferentially obtaining the cross-coupled product over the commonly
observed homocoupling product. An example for oxidative cross-coupling
of two different Grignard reagents was recently reported by Cahiez
and co-workers under manganese-catalyzed conditions.36 Similarly, gold(I)-catalyzed cross-coupling of two different
alkynes has also been reported by Shi and co-workers for the synthesis
of unsymmetrical 1,3-diynes.37 Herein,
we present the first report on cross-coupling of aryl boronic acids
using synthesized palladium colloids under aerobic conditions.

At the outset of our studies, we decided to employ one of the coupling
partners as an electron-poor boronic acid (3-nitro phenylboronic acid)
that could serve as the limiting reagent. A more reactive electron-rich
boronic acid (4-methoxyphenyl boronic acid) was then added in excess
(1:1.3) under aerobic conditions using oxygen as the oxidant. To our
surprise, the cross-coupled product (4-methoxy-3-nitrobiphenyl) was
obtained in good yields (68%), providing the possibility of obtaining
differently substituted biaryls via palladium colloid-catalyzed oxidative
coupling of air-stable and cheaply available aryl boronic acids (Scheme 8). Therefore, with
the proper selection of coupling partners it could be possible to
achieve good selectivity toward promoting the cross-coupling process
over the commonly observed homocoupling of aryl boronic acids.

Scheme 8 Cross-Coupling of Different Aryl Boronic Acids for Accessing Unsymmetrical
Biaryls
This is an attractive
synthetic alternative for obtaining unsymmetrical
biaryls compared with using hazardous Grignard reagents. Although
at this moment only representative examples have been highlighted,
the full potential of the synthetic protocol along with mechanistic
studies will be reported elsewhere.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, herein, we report evidence for the degradation/conversion
of palladacycle 1 to active palladium colloids, which
were isolated and thoroughly characterized by techniques such as TEM,
HRTEM, XPS, and EXAFS. The distribution of these palladium colloids,
with an average size of ∼2 nm, on carbon was established by
the above-mentioned techniques. The isolated palladium colloids were
shown to be active catalysts in a variety of coupling processes, including
the synthesis of diarylmethanol and oxidative homocoupling of aryl
boronic acids. One of the first reports on the cross-coupling of aryl
boronic acids was also made possible by the unique reactivity exhibited
by the palladium colloids.
