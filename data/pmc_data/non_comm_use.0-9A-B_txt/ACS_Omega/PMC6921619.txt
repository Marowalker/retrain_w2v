Silkworm excrement is a very useful biomass waste, composed
of
layer-structured fats and proteins, which are great precursors for
carbon composite materials. In this work, new porous composites derived
from silkworm excrement were prepared for selective separation of
flavor 4-methylanisole from the binary 4-methylanisole/4-anisaldehyde
mixture. In particular, the silkworm excrement, possessing a unique
nanosheet structure, is converted into a graphite-like carbon by a
simple calcination strategy followed by a metal-ion-doping procedure.
This Fe@C composite exhibits a special nano-spongy morphology, anchoring
Fe3C/Fe5C2 on the carbon nanosheets.
Density functional theory simulations showed that 4-methylanisole
presents a stronger π–π interaction and attraction
forces with sp2 carbon nanosheets in Fe@C composites than
4-anisaldehyde. The selective adsorption experiments further confirmed
that the Fe@C composites exhibited a 4-methylanisole capacity of 7.3
mmol/g at 298 K and the highest selectivity of 17 for an equimolar
4-methylanisole/4-anisaldehyde mixture among the examined adsorbents
including MOFs and commercial activated carbon materials, which demonstrates
the potential of this low-cost and eco-friendly porous carbon material
as a promising sustainable adsorbent.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Anise compounds are popular
flavor gradients used as additives
in the food industry and medical intermediates,1 mainly containing anisaldehyde, anisole, anethole, estragole,
and 4-methylanisole, and so forth.2 Some
of these species are high value-added flavor compounds, which are
usually found in small amounts in natural plants or crop oils, whereas
pure anisole has been explored as a very sustainable solvent for the
hydroformylation process.3 However, the
complex composition and low concentration have posed difficulties
for their industrial extraction and purification.4,5 Separation
of each species is even more challenging considering that some of
them have similar sizes and chemical properties, which is normally
carried out by the liquid–liquid extraction coupled with distillation
methods.6,7

Certainly, more energy-efficient separation
processes including
adsorption and membrane separation are preferred technologies because
of their ease of operation, high efficiency, and low energy consumption.8 In adsorption, porous materials are the key factors
determining the extraction and separation efficiency.9 Because of this critical role, developing new porous adsorbents
with superior capacity and fast kinetics with targeted species has
gained considerable interest in the scientific community10 as well as in industrial applications.11,12 Among these, porous carbon materials and zeolites, because of their
good chemical and thermal stability, food-grade safety, and cost-effective
nature, have been widely used for purification of flavored chemicals.13−15 However, improvements of adsorption capacity and selectivity for
targeted flavor molecules are always needed. For example, Xiao16 employed an anisole-modified hyper-crosslinked
polystyrene resin and almost doubled the adsorption capacity of vanillin,
that is, from 140.5 to 240.3 mg/g. Medellin-Castillo17 studied ozone-modified activated carbon and found enhanced
adsorption ability toward diethyl phthalate. Besides the adsorption
capacity, improvement of adsorption selectivity has also been reported.
Molecular imprinting and affinity separation have been used to recognize
target molecules and realize great selectivity for larger biomolecules
such as peptides and proteins.18 However,
separation of anisole or anisaldehyde from anise is still very challenging
because ofo their similar molecular size, high boiling points, and
diverse concentrations in industrial processes. As far as we are aware,
there are rarely published reports about this separation.

Silkworm
excrement (SE) is an abundant agricultural waste produced
from the silk reeling industry in China and Southeast Asia.19 Most of the waste is discarded and its improper
disposal can cause severe environmental issues.20 SE is mainly composed of cellulose and proteins with an
ordered structure,21 in which a high content
of carbon with a unique nanosheet morphology has been found.22 In this work, a “one-pot” calcination
of the SE can produce a nano-spongy porous carbon structure loaded
with iron ions. The obtained Fe@C composites demonstrated high adsorption
selectivity toward 4-methylanisole from the 4-methylanisole/4-anisaldehyde
(MA/AY) mixture, in which the synergistic effects of pore size and
functional groups have played an import role, causing a strong interaction
with MA through the possible sp2 C π–π
stacking and weak polar interactions.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
SE was purchased from a
farmer’s market (Yizhou, China). MA (99.0%) and AY (99.0%)
were supplied by Guangdong Hua Fang spice Co. Ltd. (Guangzhou, China).
Analytical grade absolute ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.7%),
FeCl2·4H2O (99.0%), and ZnCl2 (99.0%) were supplied by Aladdin Industrial Co. Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). All the other materials were commercially available and were
purchased at analytical grade and used directly without further purification.
Chemical properties of MA and AY are shown in Table S1.

2.2 Synthesis of Fe@C Composites
SE was
first washed in deionized (DI) water to remove ash from the raw materials
and then dried at 130 °C for 8 h. Then, it was crushed into small
particles with an average diameter of 1–2 mm. After that, the
crushed SE particles (10.0 g) were immersed in a water solution of
mixed ZnCl2 and FeCl2 for 12 h, and then freeze-dried
to maintain the three-dimensional structure. The frozen Fe-doped SE
was heated to 1200 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and held at
this temperature for 1.0 h under N2 atmosphere. After cooling
down to room temperature, the final samples were washed using 10 mmol/L
HCl solution to remove any loosely bonded species. More DI water was
then used to wash the samples until pH 7. These samples were designated
as Fe@C-1 and Fe@C-2, representing weight ratios of Fe/Zn at 1.0/1.0
and 2.0/1.0, respectively. For comparison, calcined SE without Fe
loading was also prepared and named as SE-C.

2.3 Material Characterization
Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker TENSOR
II FTIR spectrophotometer in a range of 4000–400 cm–1. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on
an X-ray spectrometer (Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5406 Å). Raman spectra were carried out on a microscopic
confocal Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, RW1000-inVia) with an excitation
of laser light at 514.5 nm. Specific surface area and pore-size distribution
were evaluated through nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K on a
Micromeritics ASAP 2460. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
were collected on a Cs-corrected ETEM (Titan ETEM G2 USA) at 300 kV
acceleration voltages, whereas surface morphology was observed using
a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy
dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan). Before the TEM measurement,
Fe-containing carbon samples (Fe@C-1 and Fe@C-2) were washed with
HCl to remove the Fe completely. Elemental compositions of the examined
samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo
Fisher, USA).

2.4 Adsorption Equilibrium and Kinetics
For the adsorption experiments, single-component solutions were prepared
by dissolving a certain amount of MA or AY in absolute ethanol and
the batch adsorption was conducted using a thermostatic oscillator
at 250 rpm. For the single-component kinetics study, 50 mL of MA or
AY solution (12.0 mmol/L) was transferred into a 100 mL conical flask,
continuously shaken on a thermostatic oscillator, and incubated at
298 K for 20 min. Then, 50 mg of adsorbents were added into the flask,
and the concentration of the solution components was determined at
the given intervals of time until equilibrium was reached. The binary
adsorption kinetics of MA and AY were performed following the same
protocol at a 1:1 ratio of MA/AY. The equilibrium adsorption capacity qe (mmol/g), transient fractional adsorption
capacity qt (mmol/g),
and selectivity (αMA/AY) were calculated according to eqs 1–3, respectively. 1   2   3  where C0, Ce, and Ct (mmol/L) are the concentrations of the examined component
at the initial condition, the equilibrium condition, and a time t (min) after adsorption started, respectively; V is the volume of the solution (L), and m is the weight of the dried adsorbents (g); Ct,MA and Ct,AY are the concentrations of MA and AY (mmol/g) at adsorption
time t, respectively; qt,MA and qt,AY are the adsorbed amounts of MA and AY at time t, respectively.

The concentrations of MA and AY were analyzed
by a gas chromatography instrument, installed with a HP-INNOWAX column
(30 m × 0.32 mm×0.25 μm) and a flame ionization detector
(FID). Samples were injected into a 1.0 μL loop, at a N2 gas flow of 24 mL/min. The temperatures of the oven and FID
were 180 and 300 °C, respectively. Under these conditions, linear
regression of MA and AY concentrations (y1 and y2, mmol/L) and peak area (x1 and x2) was performed
to obtain a standard curve: y1 = 189599x1 + 763620 (R2 =
0.999, 10.0–80.0 mmol/L) and y2 = 147165x2 – 623200 (R2 = 0.999, 10.0–80.0 mmol/L). All measurements
were performed in triplicate and average values were reported.

2.5 Simulation Method
Calculations were
performed via density functional theory (DFT) following the gradient-corrected
hybrid density functional B3LYP method.23 Chemical structures of MA and AY were optimized with the polarized
continuum model and dielectric constant of ethanol condition.24 All calculations were conducted with a 6-311g+(d)
basis set as implemented in a Gaussian 09 package (revision C.01).
The net charge on the atoms was assigned through the analysis of natural
bonding orbitals. By using highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and least unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy values for a
molecule,25 electronegativity (χ),
chemical hardness (η), and softness (δ) can be calculated
using eqs 4–6, respectively 4   5   6  where I = −EHOMO and A = −ELUMO are ionization potential and electron affinity.26

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structure, Surface Area, and Porosity
FTIR spectra of SE-C, Fe@C-1, and Fe@C-2 are Shown in Figure 1A, in which all have peaks
at 1590 and 670 cm–1 associated with C=O
stretching vibration and N–H bending vibration, respectively.27 Also, a very broad peak near 3426 cm–1 and a sharp spike at 1015 cm–1 were shown in these
samples, corresponding to stretching and bending vibrations of −OH
groups, respectively;28 however, their
lower intensity of FTIR peaks indicates a significant decrease of
O-containing groups from the original SE. Moreover, two narrow vibration
peaks at 750 and 820 cm–1, representing bending
vibration of σ=CH bonding from ortho- and
meta-groups in a benzene ring, had disappeared in both Fe@C-1 and
Fe@C-2 samples.29 It means that the graphitization
degrees of these Fe@C samples were increased after Fe-catalytic calcination.

Figure 1 (A) FTIR
spectra, (B) XRD patterns, (C) Raman spectra, and (D)
nitrogen adsorption isotherms of the as-prepared samples (SE-C, Fe@C-1,
and Fe@C-2).

The PXRD patterns of original SE, calcined SE-C,
and Fe@C composites
are shown in Figures 1B and S1. Original SE has diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 15.2/24.6° and 26.79/29.32° indexed
to CaCO3 and SiO2 species,30 respectively, which might have come from silkworms’
food components.31 After being calcined
at a high temperature, the diffraction peak in all spectra appearing
around 25.5° corresponded to the (002) plane of a partially graphitized
structure.32 After doping Fe species, new
peaks at 2θ = 36.0/45.1 and 41.3/46.1° in Fe@C-1 and Fe@C-2
represent Fe3C and Fe5C2 structures,
respectively,33 and the peak intensity
increases with the increased Fe loading amounts. We believe that these
iron carbides are formed by the reduction of Fe ions during the high-temperature
carbonization process, which also provide weak polar adsorption sites
on the surface of Fe@C composites.34,35

The
effect of Fe loading contents on the graphitization extent
of SE-C was tested via Raman analysis, as shown in Figure 1C, which suggests that all
samples exhibited two overlappings of the D peak and the G peak (ID/IG) as listed
in Table S2. These values can determine
their degree of graphitization.36 The ID/IG values of Fe@C-2
(1.14) and Fe@C-1 (1.08) are obviously lower than that of the SE-C
sample (1.77), confirming a higher degree of graphitization in the
Fe@C samples because of the introduction of Fe species during the
calcination.37,38 This enriched graphitic carbon
in the newly designed Fe@C composites may also have catalytic properties.39

N2 isotherms and the pore size
distribution of SE-C
and Fe@C composites are shown in Figures 1D and S2, whereas
their porosity parameters are listed in Table 1. The SE-C sample showed a type IV isotherm
with a clear hysteresis loop (H4) in its N2 isotherm at
77K, indicating a typical hierarchical structure with micro/mesopores,40 and it has the highest N2 capacity
and surface area (1560.2 m2/g), and a larger hysteresis
loop among the three samples. The hierarchical structure of SE-C was
composed of micropores and mesopores in its pore structure. After
Fe doping, N2 uptake and the surface area, mesopore surface
area, and pore volume of Fe@C-1 (1104.1 m2/g) and Fe@C-2
(904.3 m2/g) decreased as seen in Figure 1D and from Table 1. These changes could be caused by the shrinkage
of pore structure, blockage of pore by Fe species during calcination,
and possible density increase compared to the SE-C sample. Moreover,
the pore size distribution of all these samples were calculated by
employing DFT as shown in Figure S2, suggesting
similar pore-size distribution at 5.0–6.0, 6.7–8.1,
12.0–15.0, and 20.0–25.0 Å.

3.2 Morphology Analysis
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and TEM images of SE, SE-C, and Fe@C composites are
shown in Figures 2 and S3. The original SE presents an interesting wrinkled
structure with a smooth surface as shown in its SEM images (Figure S3A). Further examination by TEM (Figure 2A) shows that SE
actually possesses very thin nanosheet structures, which are not commonly
seen on carbon materials derived from biomass.41,42 It is attributed to a special reconstruction of lamellar structures
from mulberry leaf cellulose by silkworms through intestinal absorption.43,44 After being calcinated with Fe species, SE was transformed into
a 3D nano-spongy network packed with nanosheets (Figures S3B and 2B). This new Fe@C
composite possesses many porous channels, providing a great diffusion
pathway for molecules. Some nanosheets in the original SE were broken
during high-temperature calcination and Fe/Zn activation, which were
reconstructed into a spongy network through self-assembly. Figure 2C shows that Fe species
are uniformly dispersed over the Fe@C-1 composites. Furthermore, a
high-resolution TEM image shows that the clear lattices’ fringe
spacing in Fe@C-1 is around 0.183, 0.201, 0.205 and 0.307 nm, among
which 0.183 and 0.205 nm are assigned to the 312 and 510 planes of
Fe5C2, 0.201 and 0.307 nm are assigned to the
211 and 210 planes of Fe3C, respectively.45,46 These Fe–C lattices can be seen embedded into the carbon
layer, whereas Fe–C bonds were in accordance with the PXRD
results as shown in Figure 1B. The carbon layer with d = 0.345 nm can
be easily assigned to (002) plane of the graphitic carbon,47 confirming the catalytic role of Fe species
in the formation of graphitic carbon in SE.

3.3 Composition Analysis
In order to
study the effects of Fe species on the surface properties of the SE-derived
carbons, XPS elemental analysis was performed on SE-C and Fe@C-1 as
shown in Figures 3, S4, and Table S3,
in which the oxygen atomic percentage was decreased from 11.88% in
SE-C to 3.96% in Fe@C-1 (Figure S4 and Table S3). Thus, we believe that through Fe catalysis
and activation, larger amounts of oxygen in SE were removed during
the calcination of Fe@C-1 compared to SE-C, making the surface of
Fe@C-1 more hydrophobic. Meanwhile, 0.56% atomic percentage of Fe
in the full survey spectrum of the Fe@C-1 sample indicates the successful
grafting of iron on the carbon surface.

Figure 3 High-resolution C 1s
XPS spectra of (A) SE-C and (B) Fe@C-1.

The high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s from the
SE-C and Fe@C-1
samples present peaks at binding energies of 284.8, 285.6, and 286.7
eV, which are assigned to sp2 C, sp3 C, and
O=C–O bands, respectively, as shown in Figure 3A,B.48 Clearly, the intensity of the sp3 C peak in Fe@C-1 was
significantly lower than that in SE-C, as shown in Table S4, whereas the intensity of sp2 C was increased
to 75.3%. The reduction of sp3 C in Fe@C-1 was due to its
transformation into sp2 graphite carbon with Fe catalysis,
which in turn can also enhance the hydrophobicity of Fe@C-1.49,50 Moreover, the presence of Fe in the form of the Fe3C
band (284.3 eV) would weaken the polarity of graphitic carbon as well.

3.4 Adsorption Kinetics
The results of
adsorption kinetics of MA and AY on SE-C, Fe@C-1, and Fe@C-2 at 298
K are shown in Figure 4, in which the adsorption capacity of MA is much higher than that
of AY on these samples. MA and AY have similar molecular structures,
except for a methyl (−CH3) group in MA and an aldehyde
group (−CHO) in AY. The faster adsorption rate by MA also suggests
a stronger interaction between the adsorbents and MA than AY, and
the order of capacity of MA follows Fe@C-1 > Fe@C-2 > SE-C,
which
is not consistent with the trend of their specific surface areas (Table 1). These results demonstrate
that the surface properties and surface areas are at least equally
important in the adsorption of MA. Fe@C-1 composites exhibited not
only the highest adsorption capacity, but also the highest adsorption
density per surface area because of the synergistic effect of iron
sites and carbon sites. However, excessive loading of Fe species may
block the pores of porous carbon and lower the surface area as shown
in the nitrogen isotherm (Figure 1D and Table 1), leading to a slight decrease in adsorption capacity of
MA.

Figure 4 Adsorption kinetic of MA and AY (A) on three materials and (B)
on Fe@C-1 after Fe removal in a single component, and dependence of
−ln(1 – Qt/Qe) of MA (C) and AY (D) adsorption
on time for the three materials at 298 K.

To further understand the effects of Fe species
on the adsorption
efficiency of MA and AY on Fe@C composites, an HCl (1.0 mol/L) solution
was used to completely remove Fe species on Fe@C-1 (Fe-removed Fe@C-1).
The adsorption kinetic curves of MA and AY were measured again as
shown in Figure 4B
and porosity parameters of Fe-removed Fe@C-1 are listed in Table 1, in which the specific
surface area increases greatly. However, the adsorption equilibrium
capacity of MA on Fe-removed Fe@C-1 does not change much compared
to that of Fe@C-1, whereas the kinetics is slower after Fe is removed,
though it is still higher than the SE-C sample. Apparently, the Fe
species played an important role in facilitating the diffusion and
adsorption kinetics of MA on Fe@C composites. On the contrary, the
adsorption uptake of AY on the Fe-removed Fe@C-1 samples increased
majorly because of the increase of its surface area (SBET from 1273.9 to 1396.1 m2/g) rather than
the Fe species. This further suggests that in the absence of Fe species,
the surface area iss a major factor to determine the adsorption properties
of AY.

Moreover, kinetics data of the three samples show that
60% adsorption
uptake for both MA and AY occurs within 30 min and the adsorption
equilibrium is generally achieved after about 100 min. These adsorption
kinetic profiles can be fitted to the linear driving force (LDF) model,
expressed in eq 7. 7  where qe (mmol/g)
and qt (mmol/g) are the
adsorption capacities at equilibrium and adsorption time t (min), respectively, and k (1/min) is the adsorption
rate constant. The fitting curves of the LDF model are shown in Figure 4C,D, and the fitting
parameters are listed in Table 2. The R2 values of the model is
above 0.99, indicating a high degree of agreement between the experimental
data and the model. The slightly higher rate constant of MA than that
of AY is consistent with the observed kinetic curves as described
above. Moreover, Fe@C-2 and Fe@C-1 showed a higher rate constant for
MA and a lower rate constant for AY compared to the bare SE-C sample,
indicating that the Fe-doped surface with enriched sp2 carbon
exhibited higher affinity of MA than that of AY.

3.5 Adsorption Equilibrium
In order to
compare the adsorption capacity of MA molecules on the new adsorbents,
adsorption isotherms of MA were measured on SE-C, Fe@C composites,
and several typical adsorbents including two MOFs and a commercial
activated carbon XFNANO C-AC (Table 1).51 The experimental data
were also fitted using Langmuir and Freundlich models given by eqs 8 and 9,52 whereas the results are shown in Figure 5A,B and the fitted
parameters are listed in Table 3. 8   9  where Qm and Qe (mmol/g) are the maximum and equilibrium adsorption
capacity and KL (L/mmol) is a constant
related to the adsorption energy; KF (mmol(1–1/n)/g·L1/n) is defined as the adsorption or distribution coefficient,
and n is an indicator of the adsorption intensity.

SE-C	0.39	7.12	0.991	3.02	0.22	0.898	
Fe@C-1	0.91	7.56	0.997	3.90	0.19	0.913	
Fe@C-2	0.63	7.35	0.992	3.56	0.18	0.892

MIL-101(Cr)	0.32	7.49	0.995	2.93	0.24	0.902	
The Langmuir model provides a better fitting to the
experimental
data than the Freundlich model, indicating that adsorption of MA may
be preferentially occurring via monolayer formation over the surface
of these adsorbents. Among the examined samples, Fe@C-1 has the highest KL value, indicating the highest adsorption affinity
toward MA molecules. Fe@C-1 also exhibited much higher adsorption
capacity (7.3 mmol/g) than MOFs, in which MIL-101 has mesoporous cages,53 whereas UiO-66 possesses a microporous structure
with hydrophilic metal sites (Zr4+) and a hydrophobic surface.54 In particular, at the feeding concentration
lower than 5.0 mmol/L of MA (the inset of Figure 5B), Fe@C-1 exhibited about 38% higher adsorption
uptake than MIL-101 with SBET = 3163.3
m2/g and UiO-66 with SBET =
1292.4 m2/g (Table 1), which strongly indicates that the high capacity of MA on
Fe@C composites is dominated by the surface properties rather than
by the surface areas of the examined adsorbents. In addition, the
adsorption capacity per unit surface area of these samples, as depicted
in Figure S5, in which Fe@C-1 has an adsorption
capacity of 7.9 × 10–3 mmol/(g·m2), is about 3.6 and 1.8 times higher than that of MIl-101 and UiO-66,
respectively.

3.6 Selective Separation of Binary MA/AY Mixture
Multicomponent adsorption is important to evaluate the real performance
of new adsorbents.55,56 In particular, the effects of
adsorption time, adsorbate concentration, and molar ratio in the multicomponent
mixture on the adsorption selectivity are examined in this work, as
shown in Figure 6.
The selectivity changes on SE-C and Fe@C-1 show a clear decreasing
trend with the adsorption time, whereas the examined MOFs and C-AC
adsorbents show much lesser change in their selectivity with the adsorption
time. However, these MOFs and C-AC have a much lower selectivity ranging
from 4 to 2, indicating again that the surface property is more important
than the surface area affecting the selectivity of binary adsorption
of MA and AY. Fe@C-1 exhibits the highest selectivity (17.3) for MA/AY
at the beginning of adsorption, which is 5.8–2.7 times higher
than the examined MOFs and C-AC. This could be mainly attributed to
the unique nano-spongy morphology and high porosity (Figure 2B,C), which effectively accelerated
the MA diffusion (Table 2) in Fe@C composites. This leads to the preoccupation of adsorption
sites by MA rather than AY, resulting in a higher MA selectivity at
the beginning of the adsorption process. Then, MA selectivity decreases
with the adsorption time, suggesting that more AY molecules are getting
adsorbed onto the adsorbent surface so that the selectivity dropped.
The selectivity of MA/AY on the Fe-removed Fe@C-1 sample is lower
than Fe@C-1 (Figure 6A), which further suggests the important role that the Fe species
has played in the adsorption of MA.

Figure 6 Effects of (A) adsorption time (molar
ratio of MA/AY = 1:1 and
concentration of MA and AY = 12.0 mmol/L), (B) binary mixture ratio
(adsorption time = 1 min and concentration of MA and AY = 12.0 mmol/L),
(C) mixture concentration (adsorption time = 1 min and molar ratio
of MA/AY = 1:1) on selective of MA over AY in binary system on SE-C,
Fe@C, and other porous materials at 298 K.

The effects of adsorbate concentration and the
molar ratio of MA/AY
on selectivity were also studied under the condition of 298 K and
60 s adsorption time, as shown in Figure 6B,C. The results clearly show that the selectivity
on Fe@C-1 increases with the molar ratio between MA and AY, giving
selectivity as high as 43.7 when the molar ratio is 9:1 in the mixture,
as shown in Figure 6B. However, the selectivity on Fe@C-1 decreases with the absolute
concentration of MA and AY in an equimolar mixture solution, changing
from 17.2 at 12 mmol/L to 5.9 at 96 mmol/L of MA and AY, as shown
in Figure 6C. The decrease
in selectivity is possibly due to the quick saturation of limited
adsorption sites or a concentration-dependent diffusion rate at higher
concentrations.

3.7 Electronic Structure of Adsorbate Molecules
and Adsorption
DFT simulations were performed to calculate
the molecular properties including dipole moment (Figure S6), charge distribution (Figure 7), and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energies
(Figure 8). The data
obtained from the calculation for MA and AY are listed in Table S5.

Figure 7 Molecular electrostatic potential for
(A) MA and (B) AY.

Figure 8 MA population of frontier orbitals: (A) LUMO and (B) HOMO,
and
AY population of frontier orbitals: (C) LUMO and (D) HOMO.

The electrostatic potential of MA and AY was mapped
into the constant
electron density surface, as shown in Figure 7. The electrostatic potential was increased
in the color order of red (−0.05 eV) < orange < yellow
< green < blue (+0.05 eV), indicating that electron flows from
the blue to the red region, and the highest electron density exists
in the red region.57 In the case of MA,
electrons were transferred from alkyl and alkoxy groups to the benzene
ring (arrows in Figure 7A), which increased the charge density over the benzene ring (fluorescent
yellow). As for AY, electrons were transferred from the alkoxyl group
to the aldehyde group, and formed the highest charge density shown
by the red color (arrows in Figure 7B). This variation in electron redistribution results
in a lower electron density in the benzene ring of AY than that of
MA, which could be a major reason for the different adsorption behaviors
in experiments. The Fe@C composites possess a high amount of sp2 C, and its graphitic surface will preferentially form π–π
stacking interactions with the benzene ring of MA or AY. However,
AY possesses a strong electron-donating (alkoxyl) group and a strong
electron-withdrawing (aldehyde) group attached to the benzene ring.58,59 The decreased electron density on the benzene ring leads to increased
polarity of the molecule and thus weakens the affinity of AY with
the graphitic surface of the SE-derived carbon composites. These factors
result in a decreased adsorption capacity and slower kinetics of AY,
thus a high selectivity toward MA in the mixture adsorption.

Moreover, the dipole moments and FMO energies of the two adsorbates
were also calculated and are shown in Figure 8. Based on the simulation results, the dipole
moments of MA and AY exhibited a great difference, that is, 1.655
and 5.627 D (Table S5), respectively. Based
on their FMO treatment, HOMO energies as −6.150/–6.731
eV and LUMO energies as −0.545/–2.022 eV for MA and
AY, respectively, were calculated. Through eqs 4–6, we can see
that the electro negativity (χ) and chemical hardness (δ)
for MA are 3.348 and 2.803 eV, and 4.377 and 2.355 eV for AY, respectively.
AY shows a much smaller energy gap between HOMO and LUMO than MA,
indicative of an easy polarization. It was also consistent with their
respective dipole moment data, that is, 1.655 and 5.627 for MA and
AY. According to the principle of similarity compatibility, compared
to AY, MA would prefer to bond with a weak-polar surface of Fe@C-1
(sp2 C with weak-polar Fe–C bond). Meanwhile, the
χ and δ of these two molecules exhibited a similar trend.
MA possesses a lower χ than AY, and thus shows a mild hardness
of the basic property. According to the hard and soft acid and base
theory,24 Fe metal on Fe@C composites belongs
to a soft acid, which prefers to form stronger bonds with a soft basic
center (MA) rather with a hard basic center (AY). Thus, MA as a weak-polar
molecule, would be preferentially adsorbed through the π–π
stacking interactions with the sp2 graphitic carbon surface
and weak polar Fe species on Fe@C composites.60 On the contrary, AY was confirmed to possess the polarity in its
molecule, and thus would not be easily attracted by weakly polar and
graphitic carbon on the surface of Fe–C composites. These factors
collectively contribute to the enhanced adsorption capacity and selectivity
of MA on the currently designed Fe@C composites compared to other
MOFs and porous carbon materials, which shows the potential of SE-derived
Fe@C composites for the separation applications of anisole compounds.

4 Conclusions
New composite adsorbents
have been generated from the SE, which
is a useful biomass waste commonly found in China and South Asia.
A calcination process was used to prepare high-graphitic porous nano-spongy
carbon materials (SE-C). A metal-doping procedure was also used to
modify the surface of SE-C to create Fe@C composites for anisole separation
applications. The microscopy imaging and composition analysis show
that Fe3C and Fe5C2 species exist
on Fe@C composites. Fe activation and catalysis resulted in carbon
surface of Fe–C composites with a high degree of graphitization
having the ratio ID/IG = 1.08/1.14. In particular, Fe@C composites have demonstrated
high adsorption capacity of 7.3 mmol/g 4-methylanisole and fast adsorption
kinetics, compared to highly porous MOF MIL-101 and UiO-66. Selectivity
of MA/AY on Fe@C-1 reached up to 43.7 and 17.3 at 9:1 and 5:5 of binary
MA/AY solution mixtures, respectively, which is 5.8–2.7 times
higher than the examined MOFs and a commercial activated carbon. Our
DFT simulation of MA and AY molecules provides some explanation for
the observed adsorption properties by analyzing the electronic structures
and electron distribution. We believe that the outstanding selective
adsorption of MA was attributed to intensified π–π
interaction from the benzene ring and weak polar alkoxyl from MA with
sp2 C and Fe species on the surface of Fe@C composites.
