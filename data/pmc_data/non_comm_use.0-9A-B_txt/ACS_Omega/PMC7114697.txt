We previously developed a biobetter
version of rhIFN-β (R27T)
that possesses an additional glycosylation site compared with rhIFN-β
1a. Herein, we characterized N-glycosylation heterogeneity of R27T,
which includes both N-glycan site occupancy heterogeneity (macro-heterogeneity)
and complexity of carbohydrate moieties (micro-heterogeneity). N-glycan
site occupancy manifested as distinct differences in size and isoelectric
point. The analysis of complex carbohydrate moieties of R27T involved
the common biopharmaceutical glycosylation critical quality attributes
such as core fucosylation, antennary composition, sialylation, N-acetyllactosamine extensions, linkages, and overall glycan
profiles using weak anion-exchange and hydrophilic interaction high-performance
liquid chromatography with 2-aminobenzoic acid-labeled N-glycans.
The double-glycosylated form accounted for approx. 94% R27T, while
the single-glycosylated form accounted for 6% R27T. N-glycans consisted
of a mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary glycans, some with N-acetyllactosamine extensions, but neither outer arm fucose
nor α-galactose was detected. Sialic acid major variants, N-acetyl- and N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid,
were more abundant in R27T than in Rebif. The major N-glycan, accounting
for ∼42% of total N-glycans, had a di-sialylated, core-fucosylated
bi-antennary structure.

==== Body
Introduction
Several immunomodulatory
treatments have been approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for relapsing-remitting
forms of multiple sclerosis (RRMS).1−4 Among them, recombinant human interferon-β
(rhIFN-β) has long been used as an effective first therapeutic
intervention and a disease-modifying therapy for RRMS.5−7 Although almost three decades have passed since the introduction
of rhIFN-β therapies, they remain important for the management
of MS because of their good long-term safety profile and cost efficacy.8−10 However, there are direct and indirect limitations for clinical
use, including the need for frequent injections and high immunogenicity
and aggregation propensity, the latter of which is responsible for
the therapeutic effect of the protein.11−13 To address these issues,
in our previous study, an additional single-glycosylation site was
introduced at amino acid 25 in rhIFN-β 1a, resulting in R27T
in which Arg at position 27 is mutated to Thr.14 The additional glycosylation site increases the half-life
and in vitro biological activity, as well as thermostability, allowing
less-frequent dosing.14,15

As observed for R27T, glyco-engineering
of therapeutic proteins
can enhance in vivo activities by improving pharmacokinetic properties,
solubility, thermal stability, and protease resistance, and reducing
the immunogenicity, all of which may improve clinical outcomes.16−21 However, despite its importance, it is very difficult to accurately
determine the influence of glycosylation on glycoproteins because
of its inherent complexity. Potential glycosylation sites such as
Asn residues within Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus sequences are not always
occupied by oligosaccharides in mammalian cells because a consensus
sequence alone is essential but not sufficient for N-linked protein
glycosylation, resulting in site occupancy heterogeneity (macro-heterogeneity).22,23 In addition, the composition of attached oligosaccharides can also
vary considerably, although a core pentasaccharide unit (Man3GlcNAc2) is typically linked to an asparagine (Asn) residue
via a chitobiose (GlcNAc2).24 The glycan structure can be highly variable in terms of the antennary
structure, monosaccharide composition, and sialylation depending on
the host cell type, cell culture, and manufacturing conditions.25−28 This results in inherent structural complexity and variability (micro-heterogeneity).22 Since the complexity of glycosylation heterogeneity
makes it difficult to understand structure–function relationships,
it is imperative to characterize glycosylation variability. Herein,
we performed a comprehensive characterization of the main R27T glycoforms.
Glycosylation analysis can identify glycosylation parameters that
may influence drug safety and efficacy profiles via critical quality
attributes (CQAs). In the present study, we investigated common biopharmaceutical
glycosylation CQAs including site occupancy heterogeneity, core fucosylation,
antennary composition, sialylation, N-acetyllactosamine
extensions, linkages, and overall glycan profiles of the R27T glycan.

Results
and Discussion
N-Glycosylation Site Occupancy Heterogeneity
We analyzed
three batches of R27T purification products and purification intermediates.
We defined proteins separated by hydrophobicity over four column steps
into the main target (R27T) and intermediate (shoulder) peaks (Figure S1). Each peak was analyzed by sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and isoelectric focusing (IEF) with Rebif, a single-glycosylated rhIFN-β,
as a reference (Figure 1A). The main R27T peaks revealed a protein of ∼25–26
kDa with an isoelectric point (pI) of ∼5.3–6.9 and a
smear pI of 7.5, 8.0, and 8.3 on IEF gels, while Rebif ran as a 22.5
kDa product with major pI values of 8.0 and 8.3. The intermediate
peaks separated from the major peaks yielded a broad medium-sized
band that ran between the R27T and Rebif bands, and its pI bands were
more basic than those of R27T, and some were within the main pI range
of Rebif, indicating a mixture of single- and double-glycosylated
proteins. We attempted to quantitate species with one or two glycosylation
sites to analyze the glycosylation site occupancy heterogeneity. We
used a microchip assay and capillary IEF (cIEF) to separate and quantitate
species based on size and pI differences (Figure 1B,C). We were able to correlate the size
with glycosylation occupancy, although there was considerable size
variation (∼15.2 kDa for no glycans, 21.9–34.8 kDa for
one glycosylation, and 41.6–45.7 kDa for two glycosylations, Table S1) compared with qualitative analysis
due to limitations of the capillary analysis methods with glycoproteins.29 There were also clear differences in pI (∼7.19–7.97
for one glycan and 5.67–7.09 for two glycans). Based on size
differences, we found that R27T was made up of 94% of the double-glycosylated
form and 6% of the single-glycosylated form (Figure 1B). For the R27T intermediate, the ratio
was 5, 77, and 18% nonglycosylated, single-glycosylated, and double-glycosylated,
respectively. By contrast, the Rebif reference protein displayed 100%
single-glycosylation. These results were supported by cIEF, although
there was a slight difference in ratios (94.1% double-glycosylation
and 1.9% single-glycosylation for R27T, and 84.5% single-glycosylation
and 12.2% double-glycosylation for the R27T intermediate) because
of the more direct effect of the number of sialic acid rather than
the number of glycosylation (Figure 1C). The inclusion of the 6% single-glycosylated form
as a macro-heterogeneity with the 94% double-glycosylation form of
R27T did not have a significant influence on the specific activity,
as discussed in our previous study.14 Thus,
the presence of 6% single-glycosylated R27T could be considered a
control factor for more homogeneous molecular entities and an example
of macro-heterogeneity, but such products would not fail to meet the
quality criteria.

and lanes 5–6 show intermediate peaks comprising mainly non-
or partially glycosylated protein. Lane 7 is the singly glycosylated
Rebif reference. (B) Microchip analysis (C) cIEF analysis.

Sialic Acid Content and Variation
Because sialic acids
are terminal, negatively charged components that can determine the
serum half-life and influence the immunogenicity and biological activity,
they are typically considered to be glycosylation CQAs. The abundance
and terminal capping ratio of sialic acids on galactose are very important
because they impact the function and biological half-life of biopharmaceuticals.30−32

Overall charge profiles for R27T was shown according to the
number of sialic acids (Figure S2). The
2S component was the most abundant (35.6%) followed by 1S (26.1%),
3S (21.7%), and 4S (16.6%). The absolute quantitation of sialic acid
residues of R27T was also measured as the molar ratio of sialic acid
per R27T molecule (Table 1). The sialic acid content of R27T (2.81 mol/mol protein)
was, as expected, much greater (3-fold) than that of Rebif (0.77 mol/mol
protein), and the value was consistent with that in our previous study.14 Sufficient sialylation can prolong the half-life,
as demonstrated in our previous study.14 Sufficient sialylation could be the mean galactose capping ratio
with sialic acids as well as the absolute amount of sialylation. The
galactose capping ratio could have direct effect on the glycoprotein
half-life because neutral glycans without sialic acid are cleared
by asialoglycoprotein receptors in the liver.30−32 The galactose
monosaccharide analysis was performed to investigate the sialic acid
capping ratio and evaluate the quality of R27T and Rebif (Table 1). The terminal sialic
acid capping ratio on galactose was ∼0.28–0.31 for both
R27T and Rebif samples. Considering the pharmacokinetic improvement
from our previous study,14 these capping
ratios were somewhat lower than expected. It could cause some errors
in the ratio between galactose and sialic acid because they are separated
from the glycan under different conditions. Therefore, the absolute
value of capping ratio does not absolutely reflect the degree of capping.
It just means that R27T has a capping ratio similar to that of Rebif,
which is known to be clinically effective and safe.

Table 1 Sialylation Content and Variation
sialylation contents and variation	R27T	Rebif	
Neu5Ac (mol/mol protein)	2.75	0.77	
Neu5Gc (mol/mol protein)	0.06	 	
total sialic acid content (mol/mol protein)	2.81	0.77	
galactose (mol/mol protein)	10.00	2.48	
capping ratio	0.28	0.31	
Another important aspect
of sialylation is variation, which mainly
includes N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Because Neu5Gc cannot
be synthesized in humans, it may be recognized as a foreign epitope
with an immunogenic potential.33,34 Numerous studies have
illustrated the necessity to minimize the relative content of Neu5Gc
sialic acids in glycoprotein biopharmaceuticals.33 Both sialic acid major variants, Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, were
more abundant in R27T samples (2.75, 0.06 mol/mol protein, respectively)
than in Rebif (0.77 mol/mol protein, not detected) (Table 1). The relative Neu5Gc percentage
of the total sialylation for R27T was 2.1%, but this was not detected
for Rebif. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, ∼3% of sialic
acids were identified as Neu5Gc for the recombinant plasminogen activator,
follicle-stimulating hormone, and erythropoietin (EPO).34 In addition, EPO containing 1% Neu5Gc induces
a negligible immunogenic response, whereas EPO with ∼7% Neu5Gc
elicits a clinically significant immunogenic response.35 However, because of differences in products,
as well as dosage and frequency for clinical use, it is difficult
to generalize criteria values for the Neu5Gc content in biopharmaceutical
products. Various factors can be conveniently used to minimize or
maintain Neu5Gc levels below 1% during the manufacturing of R27T.36

Antennary Structures Based on Exoglycosidase
Sequencing
Detailed structures including core fucosylation,
antennary composition, N-acetyllactosamine extensions,
and linkages were identified
by exoglycosidase sequencing. The results of hydrophilic interaction
chromatography (HILIC)–high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed 22 peaks (Figure S3, Table S2). The exoglycosidase treatment facilitated a more accurate analysis
of the N-glycan antennary structure of R27T (Figure 2). A summary of the results of exoglycosidase
sequencing of N-glycans is included in Table S3. Data from sialidase (a368S), fucosidase (a34F, a6F), and galactosidase
(a36G, b4G) exoglycosidase digestion can be used to quantify different
types of antennary structures present within samples. A combination
of enzymes can determine the structures down to the core A2, A3, A3′, and A4 structures, for which the glucose
unit (GU) values are documented (Table S3). Digestion with α-galactosidase (a36G) or α-3/4 fucosidase
(a34F) generated identical chromatograms, indicating that neither
outer arm fucose nor α-galactose moieties were present. Comparison
of digestion with sialidase (a368S) alone and digestion with sialidase
(a368S) plus both fucosidases (a34F and a6F) revealed that most peaks
moved by ∼0.4 GU units, in line with the loss of a core α1-6
fucose component. This means that core-fucosylated structures accounted
for 94% of the total. A comparison of digestion with sialidase (a368S)
plus fucosidases (a34F and a6F) and digestion with sialidase (a368S)
plus fucosidases (a34F and a6F) plus beta-galactosidase (b4G) revealed
the core antennary structures (A2, A3, A3′, and A4) for some peaks. However, a number of peaks did not digest
and reveal the core structures until N-acetylglucosaminidase
(sph) was also added presumably because they contained N-acetyllactosamine extension, which can be added to any antennae,
resulting in diverse isomeric structures. The bi-antennary structures
were the most abundant. The N-glycosylation of R27T consists of a
mixture of bi- (42.5%), tri- (17.2%), and tetra-antennary glycosylation
(8.8%), some of which have N-acetyllactosamine extensions
(29.3%). Most glycosylation in R27T (∼94%) also have a core-fucosylated
structure (Table 2).
This could play a crucial role in the stabilization of the R27T structure
because the core fucose structure of the rhIFN-β carbohydrate
may help to stabilize the rhIFN-β structure.37 In these structures, galactose α1-3 linked to β-galactose
was not observed. This is also very important because the presence
of α-galactose could lead to potential adverse reactions, immunogenic
potential, and neutralization of the drug by anti-α-galactose
antibodies.38

sialidase (a368S; specific for α2-3, -6, -8, and -9 sialic acids);
beta-galactosidase (b4G; specific for β1-4 galactose); α-galactosidase
(a36G; specific for α1-3/6 galactose); fucosidase (a34F; specific
for α1-3 and -4 fucose); fucosidase (a6F; specific for α1-6
> 2 fucose); N-acetylglucosaminidase (sph; specific
for β-GlcNAc). Glycan structures were allocated by a combination
of elution position (expressed as GU value) and subsequent GU values
of peaks following digestion with specific exoglycosidases.

N-Glycan Structure Determination
We performed glycan
structure profiling of R27T. Herein, two strategies for comprehensive
N-glycan profiling, fluorescence profiling by WAX/HILIC–HPLC,
in which HPLC database is publicly available,39−41 and matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), were employed
in this study.

N-Glycan Profiles Based on WAX- and HILIC–HPLC
Because sialic acid is the most common CQA for biopharmaceutical
products, it can be useful to separate N-glycans on the basis of charge
by WAX–HPLC, enabling more accurate relative quantification
of multisialylated structures. R27T glycans were separated on a WAX–HPLC
column, and 17 peak fractions were collected (Figure S4A). Fractions were combined (F2 + F3, F4 + F5, and
F7 + F8) when peaks were not clearly separated. Each fraction containing
zero (F1), one (F4 + F5), two (F7 + F8), three (F9), or four (F10
– 13) sialic acids was then analyzed by HILIC–HPLC (Figure S4B). Fractions 2, 3, 6, and 14–17
did not contain any glycans. Fractions containing charged glycans
were then digested with sialidase and rerun on the HILIC–HPLC
column (Figure 3).
The structures were identified from the GU values in relation to neutral
structures identified by exoglycosidase sequencing. Fraction 1 contained
neutral glycans (bi-antennary structures A2G2 and FA2G2). Fraction 4 + 5 contained mono-sialylated,
core-fucosylated bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary (with zero, one, or
two N-acetyllactosamine repeats) glycans. Fraction
7 + 8 contained di-sialylated glycans, and both major peaks (GU 8.4
and 8.9) digested to FA2G2 at GU 7.5. α2-3-linked
sialic acid adds less to the GU value than α2-6-linked sialic
acid. Thus, we can conclude that the largest peak (GU 8.4) includes
an α2-3-linked sialic acid while the second peak (GU 8.9) has
an α2-6-linked sialic acid. A small proportion of tri-antennary
glycans were also di-sialylated. Fraction 9 contained tri-sialylated,
core-fucosylated bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary glycans with zero,
one, or two N-acetyllactosamine repeats. Both forms
of tri-antennary glycans were identified with sialidase and fucosidase
treatment: A3G3 (GU 8.35), in which the third
GlcNAc is β1-4-linked to the 3-linked mannose, and A3′G3 (GU 8.54), in which the third GlcNAc is β1-6-linked to the
6-linked mannose. There were also some tri-sialylated tetra-antennary
glycans without core fucose. Fraction 10 contained tetra-sialylated,
core-fucosylated tetra-antennary glycans with two or three N-acetyllactosamine repeats. Fraction 11 contained tetra-sialylated,
core-fucosylated tetra-antennary glycans with two N-acetyllactosamine repeats. Both peaks showed the same GU value after
the removal of sialic acids, suggesting that the second smaller peak
contained glycans with α2-6-linked sialic acid(s). Fraction
12 contained tetra-sialylated, core-fucosylated tetra-antennary glycans
with one N-acetyllactosamine repeat, as well as tetra-sialylated
tetra-antennary glycans with and without core fucose. Fraction 13
contained tetra-sialylated, core-fucosylated tetra-antennary glycans.
All peaks digested to the same GU value after the removal of sialic
acids, suggesting that the smaller peaks contained glycans with α2-6-linked
sialic acid(s). The N-acetyllactosamine extension
adds approximately the same value to the GU value as the addition
of an extra antenna (both are Gal–GlcNAc).

Figure 3 HILIC–HPLC profiles
of R27T WAX fractions before and after
sialidase digestion.

A summary of the identified
glycans matched to peaks for the whole
pool is given in Table 3 and Figure S5. The GU values changed
slightly over time (this is normal for sialylated glycans); hence,
peaks in fractions were matched to a profile of the whole undigested
pool run at the same time. The major N-glycan, which accounts for
∼42% of total N-glycans, is a di-sialylated, core-fucosylated
bi-antennary structure. However, R27T also exhibited considerable
variability in its glycoprofile, with tri- and tetra-antennary glycans,
as well as bi-antennary glycan forms being detected. Surprisingly,
rhIFN-β containing a larger proportion of higher antennary glycoforms
showed more sustained bioactivity over time.42 Indeed, in our previous study, R27T exhibited more prolonged signaling
than the mono-glycosylated rhIFN-β, with altered receptor-binding
kinetics.15 A larger portion of higher
antennary components in R27T may therefore influence the cellular
signaling effects.

Identification of N-Glycan Structures Using MALDI-MS
MALDI
spectra from permethylated N-glycans were consistent with most
glycans being core-fucosylated bi-antennary types (FA2G2; H5N4F1) with zero, one,
or two sialic acids (Figure 4). Masses corresponding to the core-fucosylated tri-antennary
glycans (FA3G3; H6N5F1) with one, two, or three sialic acids were also detected.
We also acquired positive control data from the N-glycan of fetuin,
and no peaks were detected in the negative controls (data not shown).
Annotation of the R27T N-glycan structures revealed complex glycans
with variable degrees of core fucosylation, galactosylation, and sialylation.
The major di-sialylated, core-fucosylated bi-antennary structure was
consistent with the 2-AB labeling HPLC results.

Conclusions
We
found the glycosylation heterogeneity of hyperglycosylated recombinant
human interferon-β (rhIFN-β), R27T. The glycosylation
site occupancy showed approx. 94% double-glycosylated form R27T with
6% single-glycosylated R27T. R27T N-glycans were a micro-heterogeneous mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary
glycans, some with lactosamine extensions, but neither outer arm fucose
nor α-galactose was detected. Sialic acid major variants, Neu5Ac
and Neu5Gc, were more abundant in R27T than in Rebif. The major N-glycan,
accounting for ∼42% of total N-glycans, had a di-sialylated,
core-fucosylated bi-antennary structure. These findings could assist
the development of second-generation rhIFN-β products and help
us better understand glycosylation CQAs and their biological significance.

Experimental
Section
rhIFN-β Preparation
R27T was produced from the
CHO cell line by ABION Inc. (Seoul, Republic of Korea). For purification,
R27T was applied to an affinity column to capture the target protein,
and the eluent from the affinity column was sequentially loaded onto
ion exchange and C4 RP-HPLC columns. Most single- and double-glycosylated
R27T molecules were separated by the RP-HPLC step from which the main
peak contained mainly two-glycosylated forms, while the right shoulder
(the intermediate peak) contained a considerable amount of single-glycosylated
R27T. Major and intermediate peaks separated by RP-HPLC were concentrated
and loaded onto a size exclusion column. The Rebif control was purchased
from Merck KGaA (Hesse, Germany).

SDS-PAGE and Microchip
Analysis
Samples (0.8 mg/mL,
30 μL) were denatured at 100 °C for 3 min after mixing
with reducing buffers. Separation took place at 100 V for 30 min within
the stacking gel, and 130 V for 2 h within the 12% TRIS-glycine mini
gel. Coomassie Blue staining was used for protein visualization, and
the quantitative microchip analysis based on the protein size was
performed using a Protein 230 kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn,
Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol on an Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

IEF and cIEF Analysis
IEF was used to confirm the pI
of proteins and was performed using a pH 3–10 IEF gel (Invitrogen,
CA, USA) with 18 μg samples. Coomassie Blue staining was used
for visualization. To quantitate each pI band, we performed cIEF using
a neutral capillary (50 μm internal diameter; total length,
30.2 cm; effective length, 20 cm, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA)
on a PA800 plus CE instrument (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Samples
(5 mg/mL, 10 μL) were prepared and mixed with 240 μL of
master mix, and 200 μL was loaded onto the sample tray. UV detection
was performed at 280 nm.

N-Glycan Release and Labeling
Triplicate
aliquots of
samples and single aliquots of negative control buffers were analyzed
following the release protocol. Triplicate 100 μg aliquots of
samples and equivalent volumes of buffers were reduced and alkylated,
then separated by SDS-PAGE. Samples were washed before overnight incubation
with PNGase F, and the released glycans were eluted, converted to
aldoses, filtered, dried, and resuspended in 20 μL of water.
After drying using an evaporator, 2-AB glycan labeling reagent (LT-KAB-A2
and a LudgerTag 2-AB glycan labeling kit; Ludger, UK) was added to
samples and incubated at 65 °C for 3 h in a heat block. Once
the reaction was complete, samples were purified using LudgerClean
S Glycan Cleanup Cartridges (LC-S-A6, Ludger) to yield labeled glycans.
Drying using an evaporator and redissolving in water gave the final
2-AB-labeled samples for clean-up and analysis.

Sialic Acid
Release and Labeling
A 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene
(DMB) sialic acid release and Labeling Kit (Ludger) was used to analyze
the sialic acid content. A sample volume corresponding to 50–500
μg of product protein in a 1.5 mL screw-cap vial was dried in
a vacuum centrifuge, and sialic acids were released by treating the
dried sample with 25 μL of 2 M acetic acid for 2 h at 80 °C.
After transferring 5 μL of the hydrolyzed sample to another
tube, a 25 μL aliquot of LudgerTag DMB reagent was added, and
the sample was heated for 3 h at 50 °C in the dark. The derivatization
reaction was then quenched by the addition of 475 μL of water.

Galactose Release and Labeling
A sample volume corresponding
to 50 μg of product protein in a 1.5 mL screw-cap vial was dried
in a vacuum centrifuge (EYELA, Japan). Galactose were released by
acid-treating the dried sample. For galactose hydrolysis, 200 μL
of 2 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added, and reaction mixtures
were incubated at 100 °C for 3 h, then dried in a vacuum centrifuge.
Hydrolyzed samples were derivatized with a Labeling Kit (Ludger, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. After dissolving
hydrolyzed samples in 50 μL of sodium acetate, 50 μL of
LudgerTag 2-AB and 50 μL of cyanoborohydride were added, and
the sample was heated for 45 min at 80 °C. The derivatization
reaction was stopped, and samples were serial diluted with BPT (a
purified water-based solvent containing 0.2% butylamine, 0.5% phosphoric
acid, and 1% tetrahydrofuran) before injection into HPLC.

WAX–HPLC
Detection of Differently Charged Glycans
WAX chromatography
separation of the 2-AB-labeled glycans was performed
using a LudgerSep-C3 column (7.5 × 75 mm) at a column temperature
of 35 °C with a sample volume of 25 μL. The gradient involved
100% A for 5 min, followed by 100–96% A over 5–21 min,
96–75% A over 21–61 min, 75–60% A over 61–72
min, and 60% A for 72–75 min, all at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min,
before washing at 100% A for 76–90 min at 0.8 mL/min. Solvent
A was 20% acetonitrile in water, and solvent B was 500 mM ammonium
acetate: 20% acetonitrile. The HPLC system consisted of a Waters Alliance
2795 separation unit and a Waters 2475 fluorescence detector (λex = 330 nm, λem = 420 nm) controlled by Empower
2.

Determining Sialic Acid Content and Variation
A DMB
sialic acid release and Labeling Kit (Ludger) was used to analyze
the sialic acid content. A sample volume corresponding to 50–500
μg of product protein in a 1.5 mL screw-cap vial was dried in
a vacuum centrifuge, and sialic acids were released by treating the
dried sample with 25 μL of 2 M acetic acid for 2 h at 80 °C.
After transferring 5 μL of hydrolyzed sample to another tube,
a 25 μL aliquot of LudgerTag DMB reagent was added, and the
sample was heated for 3 h at 50 °C in the dark. The derivatization
reaction was then quenched by the addition of 475 μL of water.
A monosaccharide release and Labeling Kit (Ludger) was also used to
analyze the galactose content. A sample volume corresponding to 50
μg of product protein in a 1.5 mL screw-cap vial was dried in
a vacuum centrifuge (EYELA, Japan). Monosaccharides were released
by acid-treating the dried sample. For neutral-sugar hydrolysis, 200
μL of 2 M TFA was added, and for amino-sugar hydrolysis, 200
μL of 6 M HCl was added, and reaction mixtures were incubated
at 100 °C for 3 h, then dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Hydrolyzed
samples were derivatized with a Labeling Kit (Ludger) according to
the LT-MONO-96-GUIDE. After dissolving hydrolyzed samples in 50 μL
of sodium acetate, 50 μL of LudgerTag 2-AA (2-AB) and 50 μL
of cyanoborohydride were added, and the sample was heated for 45 min
at 80 °C. The derivatization reaction was stopped, and samples
were serial diluted with BPT (a purified water-based solvent containing
0.2% butylamine, 0.5% phosphoric acid, and 1% tetrahydrofuran) before
injection.

The UPLC analysis was performed within 24 min of
the sample preparation on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II System equipped
with a fluorescence detector (excitation = 373 nm, emission = 448
nm). A 5 μL sample was injected onto a LudgerSep uR2 column
(LS-UR2-2.1 × 100 for sialic acid, LS-UR2-2.1 × 50 for galactose).
Each sample was applied after equilibrating the column with acetonitrile/methanol/water
(9:7:84%) at 0.25 mL/min (for sialic acid) or BPT solvent at 30 °C.

Determining the Antennary Structure by Exoglycosidase Sequencing
The 2-AB-labeled glycans derived from R27T were incubated overnight
at 37 °C with various exoglycosidase enzymes in 50 mM sodium
acetate of pH 5.5. The following exoglycosidases were used: sialidase
(QABio, USA) from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (a368S); specific for α2-3, -6, -8, and -9 sialic acids; beta-galactosidase
(QABio) from Streptococcus pneumoniae (b4G; specific for β1-4 galactose); α-galactosidase
(Sigma, USA) from green coffee bean (a36G; specific for α1-3/6
galactose); fucosidase (QABio) from Almond meal (a34F; specific for
α1-3 and -4 fucose); fucosidase (Sigma, USA) from Bovine kidney
(a6F; specific for α1-6 > 2 fucose); and N-acetylglucosaminidase
(QABio) from S. pneumoniae (sph; specific
for β-GlcNAc). Enzymes were removed by a protein-binding membrane,
and samples were analyzed by HILIC–HPLC using an LSN2-40m-Nlink-35%_G100
and a LudgerSep-N2 column (LS-N24.6 × 150) on a Waters 2795 HPLC
instrument linked to a 2475 fluorescence detector controlled by Empower
software version 2, build 2154. Buffer A was 50 mM ammonium formate
made from Ludger stock buffer # LS-BUFAMMFORM-2M-50ML, and Buffer
B was acetonitrile (190 far-UV/gradient quality; Romil #H049). Samples
were injected in 35% aqueous buffer/65% acetonitrile (35 μL
samples +65 μL of acetonitrile), and the injection volume was
25 μL.

Determining N-Glycan Structures by WAX/HILIC–HPLC
with
Fluorescence Labeling of Glycans
The 2-AB-labeled glycans
derived from R27T were separated using a LudgerSep-C3 WAX–HPLC
column with a manual fraction collection of the separated peaks. The
collected fractions were desalted by the evaporation of the HPLC buffer
in a centrifugal evaporator followed by the addition of 1 mL aliquots
of water to each fraction and subsequent centrifugal evaporation of
the water. This process was repeated until no salt deposit was visible.
Half of each fraction was analyzed directly by LudgerSep-N2 HILIC–HPLC,
and the remaining half was digested with sialidase and then analyzed
by LudgerSep-N2 HILIC–HPLC. For sialidase digestion, aliquots
of 2-AB-labeled glycan fractions were incubated overnight at 37 °C
with Sialidase (QABio) from A. ureafaciens (a368S; specific for a2-3, -6, -8, and -9 sialic acids) in 50 mM
sodium acetate pH 5.5. Enzyme was removed using a protein-binding
membrane before analysis by LudgerSep-N2 HILIC–HPLC.

Glucose
Unit Allocation with the Glycosylation Structure
Waters GPC
software with a cubic spline fit was used to allocate
GU values to peaks. 2-AB-labeled glucose homopolymer (Ludger product
CAB-GHP-30, 2-AB glucose homopolymer ladder) was used as a system
suitability standard as well as an external calibration standard for
GU allocation (the system is deemed to be within specifications if
the peak width at half height for GU10 is less than 0.4 min).

Determining
N-Glycan Structures by HILIC–MS
Aliquots (1 μL)
of the unlabeled portion of N-glycans released
from samples were taken for the permethylation analysis along with
negative and positive controls (buffer, water, and fetuin). The unlabeled
glycan samples were permethylated using methyl iodide in a dimethylsulfoxide/NaOH
suspension for in-solution permethylation of glycans. The permethylated
glycans were obtained from solution by extracting with chloroform,
and samples were run on a Shimadzu Axima Biotech Resonance MALDI-TOF-MS
using 10 mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile as the matrix.
The AXIMA Resonance is a unique hybrid MALDI mass spectrometer designed
for the structural determination of biomolecules by fragmentation
using MS/MS and MSn. The ion-to-trap introduction sequence was optimized
with Rapid-RF Start-Up and helium Hypercool. The peaks are labeled
with the most abundant peak in the molecular ion cluster.
