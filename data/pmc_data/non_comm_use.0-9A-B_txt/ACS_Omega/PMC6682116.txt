Reported here are the design and
fluorescence characters of a NiII/TbIII polymer,
[Tb2Ni3(HCAM)6(H2O)12]n (1) (H3CAM = chelidamic acid). Under physiological
conditions, the binding of biocompatible water soluble 1 to human serum albumin (HSA) was studied by spectroscopy techniques,
which revealed that 1 could inherent the fluorescent
light of HSA in a static quencher course and change the HSA second-level
structure. The marked enhancement in 1 and its fluorescence
intensity provide conclusive evidence that 1 can play
the role of a “turn-on” sensor for recognition and detection
of HSA in other biological interferents with a Ksv value of 7.68 × 104 M–1 and a detection limit of 0.14 μM. Luminescence experiments
show that 1 has high selectivity and sensitivity to MnO4– in other anions. Its quenching efficiency
(Ksv) is 5.54 × 103 M–1, and the detection limit is 0.29 μM.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
environmental pollution is a serious threat to biodiversity
and people’s health, many of which are documented in prior
contaminants by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); in
particular, MnO4– has received widespread
attention.1 Some analytical techniques
such as atomic absorption spectroscopy, ion chromatography, electrochemistry,
and fluorescence determination have been used for the detection of
MnO4–.2,3 However, the
detection accuracy and rate of these methods are not satisfactory.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for new detectors with high sensitivity,
good regeneration, and chemical stability. Polymers are a unique kind
of porous crystalline materials, which have been widely studied for
their application in gas separation/storage,4,5 luminescence,6,7 sensing,8 catalysis,9,10 and
magnetism.11−13 Especially, they can be used for selective detection
of environmental contaminants.14,15 Polymers may be an
ideal new material for detecting MnO4– ions.

It is well known that human serum albumin (HSA) can
interact with
several metabolites and drugs in vivo, thereby changing its pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics characteristics and further affecting its distribution
and activity toward biological targets.16,17 Due to the
complexity of biosystems, selective testing of HSA probes is an important
research object in biomedical analyses. In this work, we are interested
in the selectivity of HSA to BSA. BSA and HSA have 70% biological
similarity.18,19 Therefore, it is very important
to study the probes to distinguish the two similar proteins. Most
of the reported fluorescent probes for serum albumin detection showed
that the selectivity of the probes to HSA was lower than that of BSA,
and their detection limit was above 30 mg/L.20−24 Most of the fluorescent probes reported are fluorescence
quenching mechanisms.25 For all we know,
a few fluorescent probes that have been reported via fluorescence
enhancement may be “turn-on” mechanisms.26,27 Designing and synthesizing “turn-on” sensors is a
challenging task, because there are several factors involved in the
fluorescence process.

In this work, a new heterometallic 2D
coordination polymer (CP)
[Tb2Ni3(HCAM)6(H2O)12]n is synthesized under hydrothermal
conditions. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) study shows that 1 is a pure substance. CD, UV, and fluorescence spectra were
used to study the binding mode of 1–HSA. The affinity
constants of 1–HSA interaction and the changes
of HSA secondary structure were obtained. This CP can discriminately
detect HSA in the solution state. Interactions between HSA and 1 lead to “turn-on” fluorescence, with a Ksv value of 7.68 × 104 M–1 and a detection limit of 0.14 μM. In addition, 1 has a high selectivity for MnO4–, with a Ksv value of 5.54 × 103 M–1 and a detection limit of 0.29 μM.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 General Methods and Materials
CT
DNA, HSA, BSA, 1× TBS buffer solution, and amino acids are used
as chromatographic reagents, and other reagents are of analytical
grade. The solvents used in this study were purified by standard methods.
Milli-Q water was used in all experiments. CT DNA reserve was prepared
with 5 mM Tris-HCl/NaCl buffer (pH 7.4), 1 was prepared
with Milli-Q water, and HSA was prepared with 1× TBS buffer (pH
7.4). All the solutions are refrigerated in a 4 °C refrigerator
and used within 3 d.

Elemental analyses (H, N, and C) were measured
on a PerkinElmer analyzer (model 240). The infrared spectrum of the
400–4000 cm–1 region was analyzed by a Bruker
Vector 22 FT-IR spectrophotometer. The UV electron spectra were determined
by a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer. Circular dichroism spectra were
obtained on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) was measured by a Bruker D8 diffractometer at 40 kV and 40
mA, a copper target tube, and a graphite monochromator. Thermogravimetric
analysis in the range of room temperature to 800 °C was measured
at a heating rate of 10 K·min–1 with a Netzsch
STA409PC thermal analyzer. The emission spectra of 1 in
water solution were detected by a Spex Fluorog-2 spectrofluorimeter
(model F111, Spex Industries, Edison, NJ, USA). The spectrometer uses
a 450 W xenon lamp (XBO 450W/1, Osram, Germany) as the excitation
light source and a 950 V photomultiplier tube (R928, Hamamatsu, Japan)
as the detector. The slit, increment, and integration time of excitation
and emission monochromator are set to 1 mm, 1 nm, and 1 s, respectively.
All spectral data were obtained by a SPEX DM 3000F spectral computer.
Luminescent sensing and fluorescence spectra upon the addition of
various different cations or ions were performed on a Cary 300 spectrophotometer
with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source.

2.2 Synthesis of [Tb2Ni3(HCAM)6(H2O)12]n (1)
1 was obtained by
one-pot synthesis from Tb2O3 (0.04 mmol, 0.014
g), NiCl2 (0.12 mmol, 0.028 g), H2CDA (0.24
mmol, 0.043 g), and triethylamine at pH = 3.0 in 15 mL of water. The
reactants were placed in a 25 mL reactor, and the reaction mixture
was heated to 180 °C under self-generated pressure for 96 h and
cooled to normal atmospheric temperature at a rate of 1.5 °C/h.
One week later, light green rod-like-shaped crystals suitable for
X-ray analysis were obtained, which was filtered and washed with H2O (3 × 5 mL) and diethylether (3 × 5 mL) (yield:
28.0 mg, 39%). Elemental analysis (%): calcd for C42H42N6O42Ni3Tb2:

2.3 Fluorescence Measurements
Using HSA
as the model protein, the protein binding was studied by fluorescence
quenching titration in 1× TBS buffer (pH 7.4). The fluorescence
spectra at 273 and 298 K were measured at λex = 280
or 293 nm when the concentration of 1 was gradually increased
to 3.8 μM in 6 μM HSA solution. The effect of HSA on the
fluorescence of 1 was measured at a fixed concentration
of 10–4 M (λex = 280 nm), and the
binding strength was calculated according to the change of emission
curve.

2.4 CD Spectra
The CD spectra of HSA
(1.2 μM) before and after adding different concentrations of 1 (2.4, 4.8, and 7.2 μM) were measured in the range
of 190–250 nm.

2.5 UV Absorption Spectra
UV absorption
spectra were measured in 1× TBS buffer (pH 7.4), maintaining
a constant concentration of HSA (10 μM) and gradually increasing
the concentration of 1 (0–4.6 μM). The same
concentration of 1 was used as the reference solution
to eliminate the influence of the absorbance of polymer 1 itself. Before testing the spectra, each sample was mixed for 10
min.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis
and Spectroscopic Measurements
In this study, the heterometallic
2D CP was synthesized by one-pot
hydrothermal synthetic approaches. It is noteworthy that hydrothermal
synthesis is a commonly used method in a previous study.28 In the process of synthesizing 2D CPs, water
plays an important role as the solvent of CPs, which is conducive
to the formation of single crystals. In addition, another common strategy
reported for the synthesis of 3d/4f CPs is to use simple compounds
as ligands; however, this strategy rarely yields multidimensional
polymers.29 From the point of view of polymer
synthesis, it is meaningful to obtain 3d/4f two-dimensional CPs. For
example, the degree of protonation of H3CAM ligands depends
on the synthesis conditions, where the ligand is separated into HCAM2–. In addition, the ligand of H3CAM satisfies
the condition of binding 3d and 4f cations simultaneously—3d/4f
metal centers within the asymmetric unit in 1 (NiII/TbIII). The abovementioned synthetic methodology
used water as the solvent. The structure in 1 is characterized
by presenting a covalent 2D CP without lattice H2O molecules.

In the synthesis, it is noteworthy that water as the solvent is
very important in the crystallization process; otherwise, the polymer
crystals cannot be obtained. It is obvious that the synthesis method
in this experiment is effective for obtaining 3d/4f heterogeneous
metal CPs.

Figure S1 shows the crystal
powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) patterns of 1. Compared with the calculated
pattern of X-ray single-crystal data simulation, the line sharpness
and peak position are consistent with the simulated PXRD pattern.
The results show that the structure of the sample is the same as the
X-ray single-crystal data. As depicted in Figure S2a, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra show that 1 is dominated by a broad band and an intermediate frequency
band at 3380.62 cm–1 designated as characteristic
absorption peaks (νO–H) of coordination water
molecules.30 The absence of absorption
peaks at about 1700 cm–1 indicates complete deprotonation
of carboxyl groups. The coordination mode of carboxylic acid with
metal ions was inferred by measuring the difference (Δν
= νas – νs) of the complexes.31 The vibrations of νas(COO–) and νs(COO–) are
at 1608.56 and 1562.56 cm–1 and 1416.99 and 1331.53
cm–1, respectively, for 1, which show
that CAM plays an important role in both monodentate and bidentate
motifs.32 The results of FT-IR spectra
are consistent with those of X-ray single-crystal analysis. Thermogravimetric
analyses were measured to determine divergent temperatures of solvent
molecules in pores for thermal stabilities of 1, and
the result was carried out from 25 to 800 °C (Figure S3). For 1, the first weight loss of 13.1%
in the range of 50–100 °C, consistent with the corresponding
calculated value of 12.02%, is due to the loss of hydrogen. The second
weight loss above 100 °C is attributed to the decomposition of 1. Similar phenomena have been reported.33 The samples were heated for 8 h at different temperatures,
and the corresponding PXRD diagrams were determined. As shown in Figure S4, when heated above 160 °C, all
coordination water molecules are removed and the framework collapses.

3.2 Crystal Structure Description
The
structure of 1 was characterized by X-ray single-crystal
diffraction analysis. Crystallographic data is given in Table S1. Table S2 lists the main bond lengths and angles. When we studied H2CDA and Ni/Tb metal ions, an isomorphous 1 was isolated.
The results of the single-crystal structure show that 1 is a trigonal crystal system (space group R3) and
is found to be an extended 2D CP, with Ni1II and Tb1III centers within the asymmetric units.

In 1, an elementary entity contains two Tb1III ions, three
Ni1II ions, six partly deprotonated HCAM2– ligands, and a dozen end-coordinated water molecules (O6 and O7).
The coordination around the Ni1II center may be best described
as a bit twisted octahedron, with double oxygen atoms O(2)s from the
carboxyl groups, and the Ni–O bond length was 2.023(3) Å;
the bond lengths of other four oxygen atoms O(7)s and O(6)s of H2O and Ni–O were 2.031(4) and 2.052(3) Å, respectively,
as depicted in Figure 1a. The TbIII ion in the structure is nine-coordinated
TbN3O6 with three different ligand molecules,
where the TbIII ion lies in a twisted tricapped triangular
prism (Scheme 1a).34 All six molecules (three O(1)s and three O(3)s)
were from the carboxyl groups, and the Tb–O bond lengths were
2.409(3) and 2.417(2) Å; three nitrogen atoms N(1)s were from
the pyridyl ring, and the Tb–N bond length was 2.495(3) Å.
The bond angles of O–Tb–O ranged between 77.43(10)°
and 147.03(8)°, and those of O–Tb–N ranged between
63.19(9)° and 140.04(9)°, which are within the range of
H3CAM polymers for intramolecular ferromagnetic phenomena35 and/or fluorescence properties.36

Coordination Mode
of the Organic Ligand
One HCAM2– ligand connects one Tb1III ion and one Ni1II ion. Each Tb1III ion was
coordinated by three HCAM2– ligands, and each Ni1II ion was coordinated by two HCAM2– ligands.
One-dimensional zigzag chains were linked by HCAM2– ligands and Ni1II and Tb1III ions (Figure 1b).

The carboxyl
groups are connected to Ni1II ions in the
adjacent one-dimensional zigzag chain to form a two-dimensional surface,
which is characterized by the Tb6Ni6 cycle,
with Tb···Ni, Tb···Tb, and Ni···Ni
distances (5.624, 11.250, and 7.166 Å, respectively) in the cycle,
as shown in Figure 1c.

The coordination mode of HCAM2– can be
found
in Scheme 1b. The HCAM2– tetradentate ligand connects two metal centers (Tb1III/Ni1II). One HCAM2– links one
Tb1III ion by O(1), O(3), and N(1), while O(2) from the
carboxyl group bonded to Ni1 ion in 1. The shortest Tb1III···Ni1II distance through the
HCAM2– anion is 5.624 Å.

3.3 Fluorescence Characteristics of 1
Aromatic
compounds and the complexes have attracted attention
due to their unique fluorescence properties.37 Characteristic emission peaks for the free ligand H3CAM
appear at approximately 442 and 470 nm, which are due to π*−π
and/or π*–n transitions, as shown in Figure S5. Figure 2 shows that emission spectra of TbIII ions in H2O are very weak. Compared with TbIII ions, 1 shows strong emission bands with λex =
280 nm. This result indicates that intramolecular energy is transferred
from H3CAM to TbIII.38−40 Characteristic
emission peaks of TbIII appear at 488, 546, 584, and 624
nm, which are assigned to 5D4 → 7F6, 5D4 → 7F5, 5D4 → 5F4, and 5D4 → 7F3, respectively. Due to the coordination effect in 1, energy transfer is more likely to occur, which greatly reduces
the loss of nonradioactive energy, which can increase the flow strength
of TbIII by several times; therefore, the fluorescence
efficiency of TbIII increases several times.41

The stability of CP 1 was studied with the sample
soaked in aqueous solution for 12 h, filtered, and dried in a vacuum
oven. The samples are characterized by XRD patterns (Figure 3a); PXRD patterns of the desolvated 1 suspended in aqueous solution are in good agreement with
the calculation graph from the single-crystal data. The results show
that the 2D frame of 1 is stable in H2O. On
the other hand, as shown in Figure 3b, the strength of the characteristic peaks at ≈546
nm is almost unchanged, indicating that 1 can maintain
good fluorescence stability within 12 h, so CP 1 could
be used as a polymer for fluorescence detection in H2O
solution.

3.4 Effect of HSA on 1 Fluorescence
Spectra
In this work, 1 was used as a fluorescent
probe to detect common biological reagents. The specific experimental
method is that the crystal material of 1 is ground into
a powder sample and prepared into a suspension under physiological
conditions. The fluorescence spectrum is then tested immediately with
a biological reagent solution containing different concentrations
(10 μM). As shown in Figure 4A, when combined with other biomolecules, the emission
spectrum of 1 has little or very weak change, and the
results show that probe 1 can selectively detect HSA.
As a fluorescent reagent, the strongest emission peak of 1 is at ≈546 nm in an excited wavelength of 280 nm. Figure 4B shows the effect
of [HSA] on the fluorescence of 1. As the concentration
of HSA increased, the emission intensity of 1 increased
gradually, and no shift in emission wavelength was detected.42 The insertion of chromophores into HSA makes
the conjugate structure of chromophores more stable and reduces the
rotation of fluorescent groups, thus limiting the vibration inactivation,
which is regarded as an important reason for fluorescence enhancement
of 1.43Figure 4C shows the luminescence intensity of linear
enhancement with [HSA] from 3.0 to 9.0 μM. Figure 4D shows the influence of [HSA]
on the luminescence intensity of 1, according to the
formula I0/I = 1 + Ksv[HSA], where I and I0 are the fluorescence intensity
after and before adding HSA, respectively, [HSA] is the concentration
of HSA, and Ksv is the rate constant;
the value of Ksv is 7.68 × 104 M–1, which indicates that the effect of
HSA on the fluorescence intensity of 1 is relatively
strong. The fluorescence detection limit of the reaction was calculated
(detection limit = 3σ/k), and its value was
0.14 ± 0.016 μM (S/N =
3). The results show that 1 can be used as a fluorescent
probe for identifying and detecting HSA. However, this bioprobe gave
a detection limit that is lower than the reported detection limit
of HSA (as low as 8.6 nM).44 As far as
we are concerned, little work has been done to identify and detect
HSA using polymers as fluorescent probes, in particular “turn
on” effect on the luminescence intensity.

luminous intensity of 1 under different [HSA] solutions.
(D) I0/I vs [HSA] plot.

We also studied the detection
of HSA in the presence of various
biological interferents (Figure S6). The
test conditions were that the total concentration of HSA was 12 μM
and that of biological interferents was 48 μM. The results showed
that HSA on 1 still had a significant “turn on”
luminescence effect in the presence of 16 biological interfering agents,
indicating that the detection of 1 to HSA was not interfered
by other biological substances, such as BSA, CT DNA, l-histidine,
etc.

3.5 Effect of 1 on HSA Fluorescence
Tryptophan and tyrosine are amino acids related to the fluorescence
of HSA.45 Both tryptophan and tyrosine
emit fluorescence at 280 nm. However, only tryptophan emits fluorescence
at 293 nm.46Figure 5 shows the effect of 1 on HSA
fluorescence. With the increase of [1], the fluorescence
intensity of HSA (55% at λex = 280 nm; 78% at λex = 293 nm) increased steadily, accompanied by blue shifts
of 5 and 4 nm, indicating that tryptophan and tyrosine were involved
in the 1–HSA interaction process. This may be
a result of the interaction between the ligand and the rigid aryl
group.

Figure 5 Fluorescence spectra of HSA (6 μM) with 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.4,
3.0, 3.4, and 3.8 μM 1 (curves 1–7) at (A)
λex = 280 nm and (B) λex = 293 nm
at 298 K.

To further understand the fluorescence
enhancement nature of the 1–HSA system, the fluorescence
data at 273 and 298
K were analyzed by Stern–Volmer equation:47,48I0/I = 1 + Ksv[1] = 1 + kqτ0[1], τ0 =
3.53 × 10–9 s48 (Figure 6). The values of Ksv and kq are listed
in Table 1 according
to the Stern–Volmer curves of I0/I versus [1] at two temperatures.
The data show that there is a significant difference in the value
of Ksv under two wavelengths of excitation,
indicating that Tyr residues participate in the interaction between
HSA and 1. The obtained kq values (∼1013 M–1 s–1) is much higher than the maximum diffusion collision rate and biopolymer
(≈2.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1),49 indicating that fluorescence enhancement
between HSA and 1 is likely to occur via a static mechanism.

The concentration effect of 1 on the structure of
HSA protein was performed by circular dichroism (CD). The CD spectrum
of HSA consists of two negative bands in the far UV region and is
used to study the characteristics of the protein α-helix structure.46Figure 7 shows that the two negative bands at 211 and 223 nm were
observed to decrease steadily and in the presence of shift in CDmax, indicating that the helical structure of HSA changed when
acting with 1. The possible reason is that 1 binds to the amino acid residues in the HSA polypeptide chain, destroying
their hydrogen bond network, which in turn destroys the structure
of the protein. Changes in the CD spectrum in the presence and absence
of 1 indicate that HSA lost its secondary structure at
a higher HSA/1 molar ratio (0.5).

HSA with 0.0 μM 1 (black), 2.4 μM 1 (red), 4.8 μM 1 (green), and 7.2 μM 1 (blue) at 298 K.

In order to investigate the changes of HSA protein structure,
the
UV absorption spectrum of HSA was determined at different amounts
of 1. Figure 8 shows that there is an absorption peak at 220 nm assigned
to the n → π* transition and that at 280 nm is attributed
to the π→π* transition of aromatic rings in aromatic
amino acids.50 The absorption of HSA at
220 nm decreases and redshifts (6.2 nm) with the addition of 1. This may be due to the specific interaction between 1 and HSA, which destroys the α-helix structure. At
the same time, the absorption intensity at 280 nm did not change,
indicating that there was no π–π interaction between 1 and HSA. Excluding the π–π stacking interaction
between 1 and proteins, hydrogen bonding played a major
role in the 1–HSA interaction because the carboxyl
groups, phenolic hydroxyl groups, and coordination H2O
existed in the 2D polymer. In addition, van der Waals forces were
also involved.

3.6 Fluorescence
Effect of MnO4– on 1
To solve the environmental
problems of water pollution, people showed a great interest in the
specific detection of various pollutants in effluent. Due to the widespread
application of MnO4– in the industry
and research experiments, it has caused water pollution; the new material
for detecting MnO4– has become a new
research hotspot,51 so we have also studied
the fluorescence reaction of different anions (10–4 M) such as OH–, Cl–, Br–, I–, SO42–, SO32–, SCN–, Ac–, HCO3–, and CO32–.

Figure 9a shows that only the MnO4– ion exhibited obvious fluorescence quenching, while other anions
had minor effects. In addition, in order to explore the fluorescence
effect of 1 as a MnO4– probe,
the liquid luminescence spectrum of 1 was studied at
different concentrations (25–150 μM) of MnO4–, as shown in Figure 9b. The data show that the fluorescence intensity
of 1 decreases linearly with increasing [MnO4–] in the range of 25 to 150 μM, as shown
in Figure 9c. Further
studying the correlation between quenching results and [MnO4–], the graph of I0/I versus MnO4– concentration
should be based on the formula I0/I = 1 + Ksv[MnO4–].47 In Figure 9d, a fine linear
relation is showed (R = 0.99259). According to the
above equation, the value of Ksv can be
calculated by the slope as 5.4 × 103 L·mol–1, indicating that MnO4– has a high fluorescence quenching efficiency during fluorescence
emission of 1. The detection limit of 1 as
a fluorescent chemosensor for MnO4– was
calculated; the value was determined to be 0.29 ± 0.04 μM
(S/N = 3). A high quenching efficiency
and a low detection limit indicate that 1 can be used
as a luminescent probe to detect MnO4–. We also explored the detection of MnO4– in the presence of several mixed anions (Figure S7). The experimental conditions were that the total concentration
of MnO4– was 9 × 10–4 M and that of anions was 3 × 10–3 M. The
results indicated that MnO4– had a significant
“turn off” effect on fluorescence intensity and that
the MnO4– anion could be selectively
detected by 1 from anions such as OH–, Cl–, Br–, I–, SO42–, SO32–, SCN–, Ac–, HCO3–, and CO32– and was not
affected.

We tried to explore the mechanism of fluorescence detection
as
follows: (1) The PXRD pattern of 1 is consistent with
that calculated by single-crystal X-ray analysis, which indicates
that the two-dimensional structure of 1 is stable (Figure 10a). (2) In the
infrared spectrum of 1–MnO4–, the characteristic peak of MnO4– at
892 cm–1 indicates the existence of MnO4– in the two-dimensional structure of 1. In addition, the color of the solid sample after immersion in KMnO4 aqueous solution was observed to have changed in both UV
and ordinary light, which also confirmed that MnO4– was diffused into the two-dimensional structure of 1 (Figure 10b). (3) The EDS spectrum also supported the presence of Mn on 1 immersed in KMnO4 solutions for 24 h (Figure 11). (4) Only the
fluorescence intensity has changed (no bandshift) (Figure S8). In summary, 1 can selectively detect
MnO4– ions by fluorescence quenching
mechanism “turn off” effect. It is generally believed
that when the added analyte spreads to the microporous frame of the
polymer, it effectively absorbs the energy of the excited state of
the excitation light and/or organic connectors, while upon reducing
energy transfer to TbIII, the polymer’s luminous
radiation will be greatly reduced.52−54 The reported polymer
as a fluorescent probe for the specific detection of MnO4– ion contaminants is still rare. Among them is
{[Ba3La0.5(μ3-L)2.5(H2O)3(DMF)]·(3DMF)}n (L = p-terphenyl-3,4″,5-tricarboxylic
acid; DMF = dimethylformamide) with Ksv = 7.73 × 103 M–1 and detection
limit = 0.28 μM.55 {[Zn(bbib)(oba)]·solvents}n (bbib = 1,3-bis(benzimidazolyl)benzene; oba
= 4,4′-oxybisbenzoate) is a good functional chemosensor for
the detection of MnO4– with a detection
limit of 8.81 ppm.56 Another example is
tyloxapol with a detection limit of 0.392 μM MnO4–.57 Therefore, 1 is a rare example of a new type of luminescent probe for
detecting MnO4– in aqueous solution.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we used a
one-pot hydrothermal synthetic method to
synthesize a two-dimensional TbIII/NiII metal-based
CP as a good candidate for neutrality sensing because the ligand moiety
is a π-conjugated and water-soluble/stable fluorophore. An investigation
of sensing properties reveals that CPs can be used as a fluorescent
detector to detect MnO4– ions in water.
Moreover, it can discriminately detect HSA in aqueous media through
the “turn-on” fluorescence process. The difference in
the response of CPs to HSA and BSA indicates that the probe has certain
selectivity and can specifically detect these two similar proteins.
As far as we know, this is a rare CP based on TbIII/NiII as a multiresponse fluorescence detector for MnO4– and HSA. Under physiological conditions, the
binding properties of 1–HSA were comprehensively
studied, and the results showed that a static mechanism is involved
in a specific interaction between HSA and CPs. CD and UV analyses
show that the α-helix content of HSA is reduced and its structure
is destroyed.
