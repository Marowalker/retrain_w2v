The relative stability constants of Tb(III) complexes
exhibiting binding to a series of 4-substituted analogues of dipicolinic
acid (2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) (DPA) were calculated using density
functional theory (DFT) with the standard thermodynamic cycle. DFT
calculations showed that the strengths of the stability constants
were modified by the substituents in the following (decreasing) order:
−NH2 > −OH ∼ −CH2OH > −imidazole ∼ −Cl ∼ −Br
∼ −H > −F > −I, with the differences
among them falling within one to two log units except for −NH2. Through population and structural analysis, we observed
that the −NH2, −OH, −CH2OH, and halide substituents can donate electrons via resonance effect
to the pyridine ring of DPA while inductively withdrawing electrons
with different strengths, thus resulting in the different binding
strengths of the 4-substituted DPAs to the Tb(III) ions. We believe
that these observations possess utility not only in the ongoing development
of luminescent probes for bioanalytical studies but also for more
recent cross-industrial efforts to enhance reservoir surveillance
capabilities using chemical tracers within the oil and gas sector.

Introduction
Since the demonstration of energy transfer
from aromatic ligands to bound Tb(III) or Eu(III) results in dramatically
enhanced luminescence from the bound lanthanide ions,1−4 extensive studies have been carried out on such systems. Because
of the spectrally narrow and unique emission obtained from lanthanide
ions and the millisecond-range excited-state lifetimes, organic donor–lanthanide
acceptor complexes have been used in a wide variety of applications
including biosensors,5 fluorescence immunoassays,6−8 luminescent probes for time-resolved microscopy and bioimaging,9−14 displays,15−17 and telecommunications.18,19 In recent years, the use of Tb(III)-sensitized luminescence in detecting
ultralow levels of dipicolinic acid (DPA)20−28 has attracted much attention due to its relevance in microbial diagnostics29,30 and biodefense.31−34 Dipicolinic acid is a major constituent of the bacterial endospore
structure,35 released from the spore upon
germination; the exploitation of this naturally occurring system phenomenon
lends itself toward utility as biological indicators for routine environmental
monitoring, markers of sterilization efficiency,36,37 and, in the most inauspicious application, as first responder assays
for Bacillus anthracis spores that
have been employed as delivery vehicles in anthrax attacks.38−41 In addition, trace detection of DPA has been used in studying panspermia,
defined by aeronautics and space-related life detection, and life
in extreme environments.42−45

The specific motivation of this work stems
from recent efforts to deploy DPA-based molecules as subsurface oil
reservoir tracers.46−48 Defined as injecting tracers contained within injection
fluids and monitoring for their appearance in neighboring production
wells, tracer tests provide a plethora of information about reservoir
heterogeneity, well-to-well communication, and fluid dynamics.49−52 This information can then be used for the optimization of improved
oil recovery (waterflooding or chemical EOR).53 Our laboratory has been actively synthesizing and characterizing
DPA derivatives, which altogether serve as “barcodes”
that enable large-scale oil reservoir tracer campaigns including a
multitude of injection and production wells47,48 (here, barcodes are referred to as uniquely identifiable molecules,
which can be traced back to their specific original injection wells).
To this end, it would be beneficial to develop computational methods
for the prediction and prescreening of new ligand designs. Tb(III)-sensitized
luminescence has been selected as the primary detection modality for
DPA-based ligand tracers due to its high sensitivity. The first step
of detection comprises the complexation of the ligands with the terbium
(Tb3+) ions, which have conventionally been quantified
by the stability constants (formation constants).54 In spite of the developments in computational methods and
the vast increase in computational power over the past decades, reliable
calculations of aqueous stability constants have been difficult. Absolute
errors of |log K1exp – log K1calc| > 101 (with K1exp and K1calc are the experimental
and calculated stability constants) have been commonplace, especially
for multivalent anion ligands (due to the difficult solvation calculations
of anion ligands’ diffusive electronic structures).55−57 Nevertheless, the relative errors comparing the stability constants
of ligand–ion complexes with similar structures are more constrained.
Using the cleverly designed thermodynamic cycles, the systematic errors
within the computational protocols may be largely canceled.58−68 In this work, we attempted to calculate the relative stability constants
for the complexation of terbium ions with a series of 4-substituted
DPA analogues to preliminarily predict their efficiency in the Tb(III)-sensitized
luminescence assays. In addition, population and structural analyses
were carried out to elucidate the detailed electronic structures and
the relative binding strengths of the complexes. We believe that the
findings presented in this work not only inform better designs of
the oil field ligand tracers but also offer meaningful insight toward
the ongoing development of luminescent bioprobe applications.

Results and Discussion
Absolute Stability Constants for Nonsubstituted DPA and Tb(III)
Complexes
We first benchmark the different density functional
theory (DFT) methods by calculating the absolute stability constants
for the nonsubstituted DPA and Tb(III) complexes before transitioning
to the (more robust) relative stability constant calculations for
the 4-substituted DPA and Tb(III) complexes. Figure 1 shows the representative equilibrium geometries
of the terbium ion with eight coordinated water molecules, [Tb(H2O)8]3+, DPA2– ligand,
and their complex, [Tb(DPA)(H2O)8]+. We choose these water coordination numbers in the complexes because
they have been predicted to have the most stable structures.58,69,70Table 1 summarizes the computed stability constants
for the nonsubstituted DPA ligand and Tb(III) complexes (Figure 1) using DFT with
different density functionals, basis sets, and solvation models. In Table 1, we also included
the available experiment value.26 As shown,
the computed stability constants deviated from the experiment value
significantly. However, it has been identified that the prediction
of “absolute” stability constants is still out of reach
with current computationally efficient methods; instead, the “relative”
values comparing the trends between the related structures using the
same computation protocols are more trustworthy (next section)55−57,59 (It is noted that more computationally
intensive methods such as explicit solvent quantum calculations may
improve the predictions for absolute stability constants further;71 nevertheless, they are beyond the scope of this
work). Finally, in Table 1, we observed that the selections of basis sets (6-31+G* or
6-311++G**) have the least effect on the calculated stability constants
(with the calculated log K1 varied
by ∼ ±1), while the selections of solvation models (COSMO
or SMD) and density functionals (B3LYP or M06) have much larger effects
(with the calculated log K1 varied
by ∼ ±10 and ±30, respectively). Given the limitations
of the current computationally efficient methods, it would be very
difficult to extract more information from the absolute stability
constant calculations in Table 1.

Relative Complexation Free-Energy Changes and Relative Stability
Constants for 4-Substituted DPA and Tb(III) Complexes
In
this work, we studied eight 4-substituted analogues of DPAs (4-X-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic
acid; XDPA2– in short) with X = −F, −Cl,
−Br, −I, −OH, −NH2, −CH2OH, and −imidazole. The equilibrium geometries for
selected XDPA2– and [Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes are shown in Figure S1. These substitutes have been considered as alternative bioprobes2,4 as well as different barcodes in subsurface oil reservoir tracers.
We define the relative free-energy changes in the gas phase and in
aqueous solution (Figure 2A) as 1   2  with the brackets behind ΔG represent the free-energy changes of the specified complexations.
There were multiple interesting observations in Figure 2A. First, the relative free-energy changes
calculated in the gas phase were much higher than in solutions, with
ΔΔG°g ∼ ±10
kcal/mol and ΔΔGaq ∼
±2 kcal/mol (except for the −NH2 substitute).
The reduced energy variations in solution compared to in the gas phase
have been observed in prior studies (where the solvated ions included
transition metals as well as rare earth elements).55,57,72 Second, the trends of ΔΔG°g and ΔΔGaq generally agree with each other (e.g., positive values
for both ΔΔG°g and ΔΔGaq for the halide and imidazole substitutes
(using COSMO solvation method) and negative values for both ΔΔG°g and ΔΔGaq for the NH2 substitute); however, contradictory
results also exist (e.g., for OH and CH2OH substitutes
where we see positive ΔΔG°g but negative ΔΔGaq). As
a result, caution must be taken when correlating solution stability
constants with only the gas-phase calculations.73−75 Finally, the
different solvation models may give qualitatively different results
(Cl, Br, and imidazole substitutes), which indicated that a consistent
description of ion solvation still remains a challenge in this area.

free-energy changes in the gas phase, ΔΔG°g, and in aqueous solution, ΔΔGaq and (B) relative stability constants, Δlog K1, for the 4-substituted DPA ligands complexing
to Tb(III).

Figure 2B shows the relative stability constants of the different
4-substituted DPAs complexing to Tb(III), which were defined by 3  with the brackets again representing the specified
complexations. Our calculations suggested that the strengths of the
stability constants were modified by the substituents in the following
(decreasing) order: −NH2 > −OH ∼
−CH2OH > −imidazole ∼ −Cl
∼ −Br ∼ −H > −F > −I,
with the differences among them falling within one to two log units
except for −NH2. We note that the calculated order
was consistent with available experimental data from the literature
comparing quantum yields of 4-substituted DPA and Tb(III) complexes
(with order: −NH2 > −OH > −NHAc
> −Cl > −H ∼ −Br),4 which partially validated our DFT calculations since the
strong complexations of the ligands with the ions are the first step
for strong sensitization and luminescence.

Population and Structural Analysis
To further understand
the different binding strengths of the Tb(III) and XDPA2– complexes, we performed population and structural analysis for the
[Tb(DPA)(H2O)8]+ and [Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes. Figure 3 shows the identifying labels of the key
atoms within the complexes.

Figure 3 Identifying labels of the key atoms within the
[Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes.

It has been understood that the substitutes on
rings can donate electrons via resonance effect to the rings as well
as inductively withdrawing electrons.76 The order of electron-withdrawing strengths on the X position (Figure 3): halide > −OH
> −NH2 substitutes on the pyridine ring of XDPA2– result in the following order of partial charges
on the N1 atom (Figure 3): halide > −OH > −NH2 substitutes,
which was clearly observed from the partial charge analysis (Figures 4B and 5B). In addition, the −CH2OH and −OH
substitutes were observed to have similar partial charges on N1 (Figures 4B and 5B). The order of electrostatic potential energy between Tb
and N1 atoms (approximated by the product of their Mulliken charges):
halide > −OH ∼ −CH2OH > −NH2 substitutes, thus, result in the order of stability constant
strengths: −NH2 > −OH ∼ −CH2OH > halide substitutes (c.f. Figure 2). On the other hand, the partial charges
of Tb, O1, and O2 were seem unaffected with the 4-substitution (Figures 4A,C,D and 5A,C,D).

Figure 4 Partial charges predicted by the Mulliken population
analysis in the gas phase for (A) Tb, (B) N1, (C) O1, and (D) O2 atoms
in [Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes.

Figure 5 Partial charges predicted by the Mulliken population analysis
in solution phase for (A) Tb, (B) N1, (C) O1, and (D) O2 atoms in
[Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes.

The natural electron configuration of Tb in the
complexes was analyzed by the Mulliken population analysis with 4f
shell occupancy between 8.13 and 8.15 in [Tb(H2O)8]3+ complexes and between 8.15 and 8.18 in [Tb(DPA)(H2O)8]+ and [Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes for both the gas and solution phases.
Indeed, the 0.13–0.18 electron excess on Tb inert 4f orbitals
may be due to the primitive Mulliken analysis since electron donation
to lanthanides occurs primarily to 5d and 6s orbitals. The natural
6s, 4f, and 5d electron configurations for Tb in different complexes
are summarized in Table S4. It was observed
that the 4-substitutions on DPA ligands have minimum effects on the
relative electron occupations for Tb in the various complexes.

Figure 6 shows the
selected interatomic distances in the [Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes. It was observed that Tb–N1
distances for the strongest binding X = −NH2 complex
were also the shortest (about 0.03–0.04 Å shorter then
X = −H or halide substitutes; Figure 6A), and the next strongest binding X = −OH
and −CH2OH complexes were the next shortest (about
0.01–0.02 Å shorter then X = −H or halide substitutes; Figure 6A). On the other
hand, Tb–O1 and Tb–O2 distances were seem unaffected
with the 4-substitution (Figure 6B,C).

and (C) Tb–O2 pairs.

Conclusions
In the present study, we performed DFT
calculations to study the absolute and relative stability constants
for the Tb(III) complexes with DPA as well as a series of 4-substituted
DPA analogues. Using different basis sets, density functionals, and
solvation methods, we observed that the predictions of the absolute
stability constants have remained challenging, with the selections
of density functionals have the largest effect. We note that the same
conclusion has been pointed out by prior studies,55−57,59 and more research in this area is imminent. On the
other hand, our calculations on the relative stability constants of
the 4-substituted DPA ligands suggested that their binding strengths
to Tb(III) were modified in the following order: −NH2 > −OH ∼ −CH2OH > −imidazole
∼ −Cl ∼ −Br ∼ −H > −F
> −I, with most of the differences among them falling within
one to two log units. In the context of our original motivation for
selecting the ligands as oil field tracers, the results suggest that
these substitutes should all be suitable for the application since
the ligand–ion complexation efficiencies (as the first step
for the Tb(III)-sensitization assays) are only moderately affected.
Nevertheless, the predicted order of the modified stability constants
remains to be experimentally verified. Last but not the least, we
performed population and structural analyses on the [Tb(DPA)(H2O)8]+ and [Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes. We observed that the −NH2, −OH, −CH2OH, and halide substituents
can donate electrons via resonance effect to the pyridine ring of
DPA while inductively withdrawing electrons with different strengths
resulting in different partial charges on N1 as well as different
distances for Tb–N1, thus resulting in the different binding
strengths.

Methods
Thermodynamic Cycle for Calculating Stability Constants
In this work, we focused on the binding of DPA ligands to Tb(III)
for the formation of 1:1 complexes. For the 1:1 metal/ligand complexes
with equilibrium M + L ⇌ ML, the experimental stability constant K1 is related to the Gibbs free-energy change
for the reaction in solution, ΔGaq, by 4  where aML, aM, and aL are the
activities of the species involved in the equilibrium. First-principles
methods have been developed to compute ΔGaq with the thermodynamic cycle shown in Figure 7.57,59,60 In this process, ΔG°g represent
the free-energy changes of the metal and ligand bindings in the gas
phase, and ΔG*solv represent the
free energies of solvation for the transfer of 1 mole of solutes from
the gas phase to the aqueous phase. Note that because ΔG°g were usually calculated with the standard
state of an ideal gas at 1 atm whereas ΔG*solv were calculated with the standard state of 1 M, a conversion
of an ideal gas from 1 atm (24.46 mol/L) to 1 M (1 mol/L) was applied
with 5  Finally, with water, an additional correction, Gaql = Gaq* + RT ln([H2O]), is needed if the pure solvent H2O(l) is
adopted as the reference state for the solvent. Here, RT ln([H2O]) = 2.38 kcal/mol is a free-energy change
associated with moving a solvent from a standard-state solution-phase
concentration of 1 M to a standard state of pure liquid, 55.34 M.
Note that common logarithm (log) was used to express stability constants
following experimental conventions, while natural logarithm (ln) was
used in the rest of the thermodynamic equations.

Computational Details
In this work, we studied [Tb(H2O)8]3+, DPA2–, XDPA2–, [Tb(DPA)(H2O)8]+, and [Tb(XDPA)(H2O)8]+ complexes
with X = −F, −Cl, −Br, −I, −OH,
−NH2, −CH2OH, and −imidazole.
The proposed structures are shown in Figures 1 and S1. Density
functional theory (DFT) calculations reported in this work were performed
using the NWChem 6.8.1 program package.77 We used both B3LYP and M06 density functionals to examine the variations
in the selection of different functionals.78−80 The Stuttgart
relativistic small core (RSC) segmented/ECP set was used for terbium.81 The ECP on the terbium atom accounts for scalar
relativistic effects by replacing 28 electrons with a relativistic
pseudopotential. The 6-31+G* or 6-311++G** basis sets with diffuse
functions were employed for the light atoms.82−85 All geometry optimizations and
frequency calculations were performed in the gas phase. Most of the
geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were performed at
the B3LYP/6-311++G** and M06/6-311++G** level except for nonsubstituted
DPA complexes where 6-31+G* basis set was also considered. Frequency
calculations were used to verify that geometries were minima on the
potential energy surface and to compute thermal corrections to enthalpies
and total entropies (at T = 298.15 K), which were
then combined with the total DFT energies to calculate the gas-phase
free energies for individual species and their differences, ΔG°g (Figure 7).

Using the gas-phase geometries, we calculated
single-point aqueous solvation free energies, ΔG*solv, with both the conductor-like screening model (COSMO)86,87 and the SMD model.88 The free-energy
changes in the aqueous phase, ΔGaq, and the stability constants, log K1, can then be calculated by completing the thermodynamic cycle
(Figure 7). We note
that similar approaches have been used to predict the stability constants
for other metal/ligand complexes including transition metals and rare
earth elements with good results.56−58

The Mulliken population
analysis included in the NWChem software was performed to acquire
the partial charges and the natural electron configuration of the
studied complexes.
