The feasibility of recovering magnesium
from ferronickel slag by
vacuum reduction was evaluated. The thermodynamic calculations indicated
that the magnesia in slag can be reduced to gaseous magnesium by Si,
FeSi, Al, and C, with the minimum reduction temperatures of 2324,
2530, 1678, and 2580 K at 100 000 Pa, respectively. As the
system pressure decreases, the minimum reduction temperatures decline
significantly. Si maintains the minimum reduction temperature of 1585–1673
K at the atmospheric pressure of 10–100 Pa, acting as a suitable
reducing agent for recovering magnesium. To verify the findings, preliminary
vacuum reduction experiments, in which CaO was added to eliminate
the adverse impact of SiO2 in slag, were carried out. By
reducing slag with additions of 50 wt % Si and 30 wt % CaO at 1573
K for 3 h at 10 Pa, the recovery of magnesium reached 97.74%.

==== Body
Introduction
With the continuously increasing demand
of ferronickel alloy, smelting
of nickel laterite resources for production of ferronickel has attracted
considerable attention in the past decade.1 Owing to the advantages of good operational flexibility, high productivity,
and high quality of the crude ferronickel product, the rotary kiln-electric
furnace (RKEF) process has underwent rapid development around the
world and become a major ferronickel smelting technology.1 However, the RKEF process also suffers from a
few shortcomings, particularly high energy consumption and huge discharge
of slag. It was reported that about 14 tons of slag are generated
in the production of 1 ton of ferronickel. By now, slag has become
the fourth largest industrial solid waste in China.2,3

Depending on the cooling methods, ferronickel slag can be classified
into three types, namely, slowly-cooled slag, wind-cooled slag, and
water-quenched slag.4 Among them, water-quenched
slag is a major type in the industry. Many studies have been focused
on the utilization of this type of ferronickel slag,5−14 including those on making construction and building materials,6,7 producing glass ceramics,9 and recovering
the contained metals (e.g., nickel, cobalt).10,11 Because of the existence of magnesia in ferronickel slag, the applications
in construction and building materials have potential swelling problems,
and the addition of ferronickel slag should be limited in a small
range. For the production of glass ceramics, the necessity of applying
various additives increases the complexity of the process. For recovering
metals from ferronickel slag, most relevant studies were focused on
the extraction of iron, nickel, cobalt, and chromium.15−18 However, because of the high contents of magnesia (about 35 wt %)
and silica (about 45 wt %) as well as low contents of the aforementioned
metals (generally less than 10 wt %) in ferronickel slag,19,20 recovering metals from the slag in a cost-efficient way remains
a challenge till the present moment.

In view of the high content
of magnesia in ferronickel slag, it
may be viable to extract magnesium from slag by using a proper method.
Magnesium is the lightest metal among the commonly used structure
metals and widely used in aircrafts, rockets, and automobile industries.21 It is produced by two principal routes: electrolysis
of molten magnesium chloride and thermal reduction of magnesia.22 Because of the high cost of the electrolytic
process, at present, the majority of magnesium is produced from dolomite
by the so-called Pidgeon process based on thermal reduction at low
pressure.23−25 In this process, calcined dolomite is mixed with
the reducing agent (such as silicon, ferrosilicon, and aluminum) to
form a mixture which is then charged into a batch vacuum reduction
furnace to obtain magnesium vapor for condensation and collection.26−28 Regarding the similar content of magnesia in ferronickel slag to
that of calcined dolomite, a new method for recovering magnesium from
ferronickel slag by vacuum reduction was proposed in this study. Its
feasibility was first examined by thermodynamic analysis of reduction
of magnesia considering both effects of reducing agents and reaction
pressure. Because silica is the main impurity component of ferronickel
slag, which may play an important role in the reduction,29 its influence was also examined. The findings
were then verified by preliminary experiments. It was found that by
vacuum reduction of ferronickel slag with additions of Si and CaO,
which controlled the adverse impact of silica, at 10 Pa, high recovery
of magnesium could be obtained from the slag.

Experimental Section
Materials
The ferronickel slag used in this study was
obtained from a ferronickel smelting plant in China, which produces
Ni–Fe alloy by the RKEF process. This slag contained 48.29
wt % SiO2, 30.95 wt % MgO, 2.11 wt % Cr2O3, 7.39 wt % FeO, and 4.04 wt % Al2O3. Its main mineral phase was olivine (Mg1.8Fe0.2SiO4).12 Silicon and calcium
oxide of the analytical grade were used as the reducing agent and
additive, respectively.

Methods
Thermodynamic Calculation
The thermodynamic analysis
of relevant reactions during reduction of ferronickel slag with the
addition of various reducing agents was performed by establishing
the corresponding Gibbs free energy changes of reactions versus temperature
(ΔrGm–T) graphs and phase diagrams using the software FactSage
7.2 (Thermfact/CRCT and GTT-Technologies, Montreal, Canada and Herzogenrath,
Germany) based on its databases of FactPs, FToxid, and FTSalt.

Verification
Tests
In order to verify the findings
of thermodynamic analysis, the vacuum reduction experiments were carried
out. Initially, the ferronickel slag sample with a particle size less
than 0.074 mm was mixed homogeneously with predetermined amounts of
the reducing agent and additives (100% particles passing 0.074 mm).
Then, the mixture was used to produce briquettes of 15 mm in diameter
and 15 mm in height by hydraulic pressing at 50 MPa. The briquettes
were loaded in a graphite crucible and roasted in a vacuum furnace,
which was maintained at a preset temperature (1573 K) and vacuum degree
for a given period of time. After reduction, the briquettes were taken
out for characterization and analysis. The magnesium contents in the
briquettes before/after reduction were measured for calculating the
recovery of magnesium using the following equation 1  where η is the
recovery of Mg; W1 and W2 are the
Mg contents of the samples before reduction and after reduction, respectively; M1 and M2 are the
masses of the samples before reduction and after reduction, respectively.

The chemical compositions of the samples were measured by using
an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Axios Max, PANalytical, Netherlands).
To confirm the phase transformation in ferronickel slag due to vacuum
reduction, the phase compositions of the samples were determined by
using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer (D/Max 2550 PC, Rigaku
Co., Ltd, Japan) with a Cu anode (wavelength 1.54056 Å, step
scan mode, scan range from 10° to 80°, scan speed 5°/min,
and step length 0.02°).

Results and Discussion
Thermodynamic
Analysis
ΔrGm–T Graphs
In vacuum reduction, the reducing agent
and reaction pressure are crucial for the process. In order to seek
a suitable reducing agent for the recovery of magnesium from ferronickel
slag, the reactions between ferronickel slag and different reducing
agents, including Si, FeSi, Al, and C, were investigated. According
to the chemical composition of ferronickel slag, the possible reactions
between magnesia and reducing agents are as follows 2   3   4   5  

The ΔrGm–T graphs of the above reactions
at different pressures are shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1a, in the presence of Si, magnesia can be
converted to gaseous magnesium at different temperatures, depending
upon the system pressure. In specific, at the standard atmospheric
pressure (100 000 Pa), the reduction of magnesia to gaseous
magnesium demands a temperature higher than 2324 K (at which the Gibbs
free energy change of reaction was 0). As the system pressure decreases,
the minimum temperature required for the reduction declines significantly.
For instance, when the system pressure decreases to 10 Pa, the minimum
temperature drops to 1585 K. It will further decrease to 1417 K at
1 Pa.

Figure 1 ΔrGm–T graphs for reactions between MgO and different reducing
agents: (a) Si, (b) FeSi, (c) Al, and (d) C.

As shown in Figure 1b, when FeSi is used as the reducing agent, the ΔrGm value of the reaction between MgO
and FeSi decreases evidently with increasing temperature and decreasing
pressure. The minimum temperature required for reducing magnesia to
gaseous magnesium at the standard atmospheric pressure was 2530 K.
As the pressure decreases to as low as 10 and 1 Pa, the minimum temperatures
required for the reduction decrease to 1598 and 1467 K, respectively.

By using Al as the reducing agent, magnesia will be reduced to
gaseous magnesium above 1678 K at the standard atmospheric pressure,
as shown in Figure 1c. As the system pressure decreases, the minimum temperature required
for the reduction decreases significantly. When the system pressure
decreases to 10 and 1 Pa, the temperatures decline to 977 and 909
K, respectively.

In the presence of C, magnesia can also be
reduced to gaseous magnesium,
in spite of stricter requirements for temperature and system pressure
(Figure 1d). At the
standard atmospheric pressure, the minimum temperature required for
the reduction of magnesia to gaseous magnesium is 2580 K. As the system
pressure declines to 10 and 1 Pa, the temperatures drop to 1622 and
1505 K, respectively.

Based on the above analysis, it is feasible
to recover gaseous
magnesium from the slag despite the high temperature requirement when
the process is operated at the standard atmospheric pressure. By reducing
system
pressure, the minimum temperature required for reducing magnesia to
gaseous magnesium decreases significantly. Among all the reducing
agents, Al has the advantage of low reduction temperature. However,
it is explosive and difficult to control during the reduction process.
Conversely, by using C as the reducing agent, the minimum temperature
required for the reduction is too high for practical operation, which
limits its application. In addition, it causes emission of CO2 which would enter into the condensing zone with magnesium
vapor, reverting the reaction. By comparing Si and FeSi as the reducing
agents, the former one requires lower temperatures for reducing magnesia
to gaseous magnesium, in particular at the system pressure of 10–100
Pa. On the other hand, the latter one has a lower cost. However, some
silicon in ferrosilicon may not participate in the reaction, leading
to the slow reaction rate and low reduction percentage of magnesia.24 In this study, Si was chosen as the suitable
reducing agent.

Phase Diagrams
In order to further
reveal the phase
transformation of ferronickel slag for recovery of magnesium in the
presence of Si, relevant phase diagrams were calculated. The phase
diagrams of the MgO–Si system at the atmospheric pressures
of 100 000, 100, and 10 Pa are shown in Figures 2–4, respectively. As
shown in Figure 2,
MgO and Si remain unchanged until the temperature is higher than 1690
K at which a liquid phase appears. At 1690–1856 K, by keeping
the value of MgO/(MgO + Si) above 0.02, Mg2SiO4 generates and remains stable. When the temperature is elevated to
2073 K, a gas phase emerges, indicating the possibility to obtain
gaseous magnesium at the standard atmospheric pressure. As the system
pressure decreases to 100 Pa, the formation temperature of the gas
phase decreases by 728 K and the stability area of Mg2SiO4 changes significantly. As shown in Figure 3, at 1345–2237 K, when the value of
MgO/(MgO + Si) exceeds 0.6, Mg2SiO4 remains
stable. In other words, the value of MgO/(MgO + Si) should be lower
than 0.6 to ensure the reduction of magnesia to gaseous magnesium.
When the temperature is higher than 2400 K, only the gas phase exists.
It is harmful for recovery of magnesium from the gas phase because
Si also evaporates into the gas phase, resulting in the difficult
separation of magnesium. As shown in Figure 4, when the system pressure decreases to 10
Pa, the phase diagram of the MgO–Si system changes slightly.
The formation temperature of the gas phase decreases further to 1273
K and similarly only the gas phase exists at temperatures above 2223
K.

Figure 2 Phase diagram of the MgO–Si system (100 000 Pa).

Figure 3 Phase diagram of the MgO–Si system (100 Pa).

Figure 4 Phase diagram of the MgO–Si system (10 Pa).

According to Figures 2–4, it is obvious
that the minimum
temperature required for reduction of magnesia to gaseous magnesium
decreases significantly with decreasing atmospheric pressure. Meanwhile,
the theoretical suitable areas (the green areas in Figures 2–4) for recovery of gaseous magnesium from the slag decrease. It shows
stricter requirements for selecting addition of the reducing agent,
indicated by the smaller value of MgO/(MgO + Si) and the lower temperatures
for the process operated at lower pressures.

As aforementioned,
SiO2 is the main impurity component
in ferronickel slag. It may significantly reduce the efficiency for
recovery of magnesium due to its reaction with MgO which produces
MgSiO3 that is expected to suppress the reduction of magnesia.
To avoid this negative impact, the activity of SiO2 must
be lowered and it can be realized by adding alkaline agents, such
as low-cost CaO. Figure 5 shows the calculated phase diagram of the CaO–MgO–SiO2 system. It reveals that the addition of CaO will induce its
reaction with silica to produce Ca2SiO4, CaSiO3, and Ca3Si2O7. Meanwhile,
MgO will remain stable when the mass fraction of CaO is less than
0.7 (the yellow area in Figure 5). From this perspective, with proper addition of CaO, it
is feasible to eliminate the adverse impact of SiO2 during
recovery of magnesium from ferronickel slag by vacuum reduction.

diagram of the CaO–MgO–SiO2 system.

Verification Test of Recovery of Magnesium
from Ferronickel
Slag
To verify the findings of thermodynamic analysis, the
vacuum reduction experiments of slag were carried out by reducing
the slag using Si as the reducing agent. The effect of Si addition
on the recovery of magnesium from the slag was explored under the
conditions of the addition of 30 wt % CaO, reduction temperature of
1573 K, reduction time of 3 h, and system pressure of 10 Pa. As shown
in Figure 6, when the
addition of Si increased from 20 to 50 wt %, the recovery of Mg increased
from 13.30 to 97.74%. As the addition of Si was further increased,
the recovery of Mg increased slightly. It was shown that recovering
gaseous magnesium from the slag was feasible under vacuum conditions,
agreeing with the thermodynamic analysis. The effect of the addition
of CaO on the recovery of magnesium from the slag was examined by
fixing the conditions of addition of 50 wt % Si, reduction temperature
of 1573 K, reduction time of 3 h, and atmospheric pressure of 10 Pa.
According to Figure 6, without the addition of CaO, the recovery of Mg was relatively
low (35.73%). Under the same experimental conditions, the presence
of 30 wt % CaO promoted the recovery of Mg considerably to 97.74%.
When the addition of CaO increased further to 40 wt %, the recovery
of Mg remained relatively stable. The effect of CaO was also verified
by comparing the main chemical compositions of the ferronickel slag
samples after vacuum reduction in the absence or presence of CaO,
which are provided in Table 1. The contents of Mg in the samples after vacuum reduction
with additions of 0 wt % CaO and 30 wt % were 12.55 and 0.30 wt %,
respectively. The big difference between the two cases was believed
to be associated with the phase transformation in slag during vacuum
reduction. This speculation was confirmed by Figure 7 which shows the main phases of the slag
after vacuum reduction. In the absence of CaO, the main phases of
the
slag after vacuum reduction were olivine and silicon, indicating incomplete
conversion of magnesia in the slag even with the excessive addition
of the reducing agent. On the contrary, in the presence of 30 wt %
CaO, the main phases were changed to dicalcium silicate, silicon,
and katiote, partially confirming the desirable reduction of magnesia
in the slag. The experimental results agreed well with the thermodynamic
analysis, verifying the feasibility to recover magnesium from ferronickel
slag by vacuum reduction. It should be pointed out that the process
is not only economically viable but also environmentally friendly.
After the reduction, the resulting slag has the potential to be used
as a good construction material because it had a similar composition
(mainly SiO2 and CaO) to a few types of metallurgical slag
which have been widely applied in construction and relevant fields.30

Conclusions
The feasibility of recovering magnesium from ferronickel slag by
vacuum reduction using different reducing agents (Si, FeSi, Al, and
C) has been evaluated based on the thermodynamic analysis and experimental
verification. The thermodynamic calculations indicated that magnesia
can be reduced to gaseous magnesium by Si, FeSi, Al, and C, with the
minimum reduction temperatures of 2324, 2530, 1678, and 2580 K at
the standard atmospheric pressure, respectively. As the atmospheric
pressure decreases, the minimum temperatures required for the reduction
decline significantly. It was found that Si is suitable for recovery
of magnesium from ferronickel slag with the minimum reduction temperature
of 1585–1673 K at 10–100 Pa despite stricter requirements
for the addition of the reducing agent and temperature with decreasing
atmospheric pressure. For improving vacuum reduction, CaO has been
found to be a good additive for eliminating the negative impact of
SiO2 on the reduction. The experimental verification test
showed that after vacuum reduction of ferronickel slag at 1573 K for
3 h in the presence of 50 wt % Si and 30 wt % CaO at 10 Pa, the recovery
of Mg reached 97.74%, much higher than that without addition of CaO
(35.73%). These results confirmed the good viability of recovering
magnesium from ferronickel slag by vacuum reduction in the presence
of CaO.
