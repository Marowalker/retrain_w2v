Because
of the constantly increasing demand for highly safe lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs), interest in the development of ceramic composite
separators (CCSs) is growing rapidly. Here, an in-depth study of the
adhesion properties of the Al2O3 ceramic composite
coating layer of CCSs is conducted using a peel test and a surface
and interfacial cutting analysis system (SAICAS). Contrary to the
90 and 180° peel tests, which resulted in different adhesion
strengths even for the same CCS sample, the SAICAS is able to measure
the adhesion properties uniformly as a function of depth from the
surface of the coating layer. The adhesion strengths measured at the
midlayer (Fmid) and interface (Finter, interlayer between the separator and
the ceramic coating layer) are compared for various types of CCS samples
with different amounts of polymeric binder, and it is found that Finter is higher than Fmid for all CCSs. Compared with Fmid, Finter is significantly affected by
storage in the liquid electrolyte (under wet condition).

Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) have been utilized as promising power
sources for powering mobile electric devices for several decades.1−3 Recently, the increasing demand for large-scale battery applications,
such as electric vehicles (EVs) and energy-storage systems (ESSs),
has increased the demand for the development of next-generation LIBs
with high energy densities, high rate capabilities, long life cycles,
low cost, and high safety. Safety must be the primary concern because
LIBs that are not safe can harm consumers’ health and influence
the very survival of the companies involved.4,5 In
general, commercialized LIBs contain large amounts of combustible
organic solvents in the electrolytes and can cause thermal runaway
when LIBs are exposed to detrimental conditions (e.g., high-temperature
exposure, overcharge condition, high-temperature operation, and short
circuit).6,7

Separators prevent electrical short
circuits by keeping the positive
and negative electrodes apart and complete the circuit as the ions
pass through the microporous structures in the electrochemical cell.8 In general, commercial separators are based on
microporous polyolefin membranes made of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene,
and their combination because of their superior properties, such as
electrochemical stability, ease of processing, low cost, and high
mechanical strength.8−10 However, the hydrophobic surface character of polyolefin-based
separators has hampered the battery performance because of their poor
compatibility with the conventional polar solvents used in the liquid
electrolyte.9−11 Furthermore, the stretching process, which is indispensable
for the formation of micropores in polyolefin-based separators, is
the main origin of the dimensional shrinkage of these separators upon
exposure to high temperature. This dimensional shrinkage of separators
causes an internal short circuit between electrodes, resulting in
serious safety issues.12,13 Many battery manufacturers and
researchers have considered ceramic composite separators (CCSs) to
be a good option for overcoming the top-priority problems of polyolefin-based
separators, such as the poor wetting ability to liquid electrolytes
and their dimensional stability.14−18

In general, CCSs include composite coating
layers, which consist
of nanosized hydrophilic ceramic particles entangled with a small
amount of polymeric binders. During the manufacturing process of LIBs,
which is accompanied by high mechanical stress, some of the ceramic
particles can detach from the separator surface, act as defects that
diminish the electrochemical performance, and even cause the thermal
runaway of LIBs ascribed to the nonuniform impedance.19,20 To control the quality of CCSs, particularly in composite coating
layers, a measurement and analysis method for evaluating the adhesion
properties of composite coating layers is required.

In this
study, we investigated the adhesion properties of the ceramic
composite coating layers of CCSs using the surface and interfacial
cutting analysis system (SAICAS). In contrast to the conventional
peel test adhesion evaluation technique, the SAICAS can adjust the
blade depth from the coating surface and can thus evaluate the adhesion
properties of the coating layer in the region of interest.16,21−23 First, we compared the adhesion properties measured
using a peel test and a SAICAS technique. Then, we evaluated the effects
of the amount of polymeric binders and the liquid electrolyte swelling
on the adhesion properties of the ceramic composite coating layers
of CCSs.

Results and Discussion
We prepared various types of
CCSs with different amounts of polymeric
binders, as listed in Table 1. For the facile preparation of Al2O3-based ceramic composite coating layer on the hydrophobic PE separators,
we utilized the surfactant-assisted coating technique, as reported
in our previous studies.16,17 We denoted each CCS
0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt %, representing the amount of polymeric binder
in the ceramic coating layer. The physical properties of each CCS,
including the coating thickness, Gurley number, bulk resistance, ionic
conductance, and ionic conductivity, are listed in Table 2 (Figure S2 and Table S3). Regardless of the amount of polymeric binder,
the thickness of the ceramic coating layer was uniformly controlled
to be 6 μm, and the Gurley number was slightly increased for
each case. The 0.5 wt % revealed the highest ionic conductivity that
was ascribed to the increased wettability to the polar liquid electrolyte
because of the existence of the hydrophilic Al2O3.17 As the amount of polymeric binder
increased, the ionic conductivity decreased slightly because the excess
amount of polymeric binders impeded the porous structures of the composite.
It is noteworthy that each CCS nonetheless displayed a higher ionic
conductivity value than that of bare PE.

Before
the SAICAS study, we evaluated the adhesion properties of
the ceramic composite coating layers of CCSs by the peel test. As
demonstrated in Figure 1a,b, we utilized two different types of peeling techniques to pull
the tapes adhered on the top of the coating layers at different angles
of 90° (90° peel test, Figure 1a)24 and 180°
(180° peel test, Figure 1b)25,26 from the substrate. Both these
tests have been randomly used without deep consideration because,
in principle, the adhesion properties measured using both techniques
should be the same. Surprisingly, we found that the techniques resulted
in a variation of adhesion values for each ceramic composite coating
layer of CCSs containing different amounts of polymeric binders: for
0.5 and 1.0 wt %, the 90° peel test showed higher adhesion strengths
than those found by the 180° peel test, whereas a smaller value
was obtained for 2.0 wt % by the 90° peel test than by the 180°
peel test (Figure 1c). Although the exact origin for these phenomena is currently not
clearly understood, these cases show that the peel test technique
is not appropriate for the precise evaluation of the adhesion property
of the ceramic composite coating layers.

Figure 1 Schematics of the (a)
90° and (b) 180° peel tests. (c)
Comparison of the adhesion strength of the CCSs measured by the 90
and 180° peel tests.

We measured the adhesion properties of the ceramic composite
coating
layers for CCSs with different amounts of polymeric binder. We used
CCSs with the ceramic composite coating layers of 6 μm listed
in Table 2 and measured
the midlayer (Fmid, 3 μm from the
surface) and interfacial (Finter, 6 μm
from the surface: interlayer between the separator and the ceramic
coating layer) adhesion strengths of the ceramic composite coating
layer by adjusting the blade depth from the coating layer surface.

To verify the validity of the SAICAS technique for separators,
the CCS surface was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
after measuring Fmid and Finter. After the measurement of Finter, the porous separator substrate was exposed to the surface
while the ceramic coating layer was uniformly covering the entire
area of the CCS (Figure 2). These results prove that the SAICAS blade is precisely regulated
and that the SAICAS results for Fmid and Finter are reliable.

Figure 2 Schematics of the SAICAS
measurements for (a) Finter and (b) Fmid. SEM images
of the CCSs after measuring (c, e) Finter and (d, f) Fmid using a SAICAS.

For both cases, Fmid and Finter, CCSs with
the higher amount of polymeric binder
showed higher adhesion strength values (Figure 3). For convenience, the adhesion strength
of each case is summarized in Table 3. These results are reasonable because a higher amount
of polymeric binder can entangle ceramic particles more firmly. It
is remarkable that the Finter is higher
than the Fmid for each case, which is
in good agreement with the SAICAS results recently reported in our
previous study of electrodes.21 Thus, the
higher Finter can be ascribed to the higher
pressure of the heavier ceramic coating layers on the separator relative
to the midlayer position. In contrast, heterosubstrates can affect
the detachment property between them and Finter because Finter arises from the inorganic
composite coating layer and the polymeric separator, whereas Fmid arises from the same substrate.21 To eliminate this interfacial inhomogeneity
issue, we prepared a 2 wt % CCS with a 10 μm coating thickness
and investigated the Fmid at 3, 6, and
9 μm using SAICAS, where the blade does not meet the polymeric
separator surface during the measurement. The Fmid of each case still showed an increasing trend with increasing
depth from the surface (Figure 4).

(b) Fmid) of the CCSs as a function of
the amount of polymeric binder (0.1, 0.5, and 2.0 wt % CCSs) measured

The effect
of the storage of liquid electrolyte on the adhesion
properties of the ceramic coating layers of CCSs was investigated.
For this purpose, 2 wt % CCS with a 6 μm thick coating, as shown
in Table 2, was immersed
in the liquid electrolyte and stored at 25 and 60 °C for 12 h,
and Fmid and Finter of each storage case were measured. For both temperatures, Fmid and Finter decreased
after storage (Figure 5). Finter after storage at 25 °C
(F25-inter) and 60 °C (F60-inter) showed almost identical values
(F25-inter ≈ F60-inter), whereas Fmid after storage at 25 °C (F25-mid) was higher than that after storage at 60 °C (F60-mid) (F25-mid > F60-mid). Again, as discussed
above, we believe that these discrepancies can be ascribed to the
heterogeneous nature of CCSs:21Finter is the adhesion strength between the heterosubstrates,
whereas Fmid arises from the homosubstrates.
From these results, it is inferred that the substrate affinity between
the ceramic composite layers and the polymeric separators is more
sensitive to the external environment (wet condition) than is the
inner adhesion of the ceramic composite layers.

Figure 5 (a) Finter and (b) Fmid of CCSs
measured using a SAICAS after storage of liquid
electrolyte at 25 and 60 °C for 12 h.

We compared the adhesion properties of the ceramic composite
coating
layers measured by the 90° peel test and SAICAS. As discussed
above (Figure 3 and Table 3), the SAICAS results
revealed that the adhesion strength near the interfaces between the
ceramic composite layer and polymer separators is higher than that
for the midlayer of the ceramic composite layer (Finter > Fmid). In this
case,
the midlayer of the ceramic composite layer would be cracked and a
portion of this layer should be pulled off to the tape surface (Figure 6a), resulting in
the tape becoming nearly semitransparent because the opacity of the
tape is proportional to the transferred amount of the ceramic composite
layer. On the contrary, if Finter is smaller
than Fmid (Finter < Fmid), the entire ceramic composite
layer would be pulled off with the tape surface (Figure 6b), resulting in the tape becoming
opaque white.

composite
coating layer from the CCSs after the 90° peel test when (a) Finter > Fmid and
(b) Finter < Fmid. (c) Digital camera images of the tapes and CCSs after
the 90° peel test.

On the basis of the SAICAS results (Figure 3), we expected the color of the tapes for
all CCSs (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt %) to remain semitransparent because Finter was larger than Fmid for every case (Finter > Fmid). However, after the 90° peel test,
0.5 and 1.0 wt % CCSs turned opaque white, whereas the tape for 2.0
wt % CCS remained semitransparent (Figure 6c). We believe that these conflicting results
were due to the inherent morphologically inhomogeneous nature of the
composite materials. For instance, the composite materials used in
our study included nanometer-sized Al2O3 ceramic
particles and polymeric binders. On the basis of Griffith’s
crack theory,27 the material fracture is
originated due to the presence of microscopic flaws in the bulk material.
If structural defects, that is, microscopic flaws, are present in
the material, the fracture stress increases and the material can be
easily fractured and/or torn apart in spite of its inherent mechanical
strength. Again, together with the adhesion-strength discrepancies
discussed for the 90 and 180° peel tests (Figure 1), the comparison between the 90° peel
test and SAICAS highlighted the incoherent characteristic of the peel
test. SEM images for CCSs (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt %) after the 90°
peel test indicate that our presumption based on the change of tape
color was reasonable; the polymer separator was exposed after the
90° peel test for 0.5 and 1.0 wt % CCSs, whereas the ceramic
coating layers are partially ripped off the polymer separator for
2.0 wt % CCS (Figure 7).

Figure 7 (a) Schematic of the observed area, and SEM images of the same
after the 90° peel test for (b) 0.5, (c) 1.0, and (d) 2.0 wt
% CCSs.

Regardless of the existence of
microscopic flaws, SAICAS is less
affected by the morphological nature of the substrate because it calculates
the adhesion strength on the basis of the force applied by the limited
length of the blade. Consequently, SAICAS can measure the adhesion
strength more accurately than the peel test.

Conclusions
The
adhesion properties of the ceramic coating layer of CCSs were
measured using the peel test and SAICAS. We observed that the peel
test and SAICAS reveal inexplicable differences in the adhesion properties
of CCSs. These are closely related to the microscopic flaws existing
in the bulk material that are closely related to the morphological
feature of the CCSs. Because of the inherent inhomogeneity of CCSs
consisting of ceramic particles and polymeric binders, the microscopic
flaws appear to be inevitable, thus making the peel test inappropriate
for evaluating the adhesion properties of CCSs. In contrast to the
peel test, SAICAS is carried out on the basis of the length of the
blade cutting through the ceramic coating layer and is thus less influenced
by the morphological features of the CCSs. SAICAS could measure the
adhesion strength as a function of the blade depth relative to the
surface coating. By varying the blade depth relative to the coating
layer surface, the adhesion strengths at the midlayer of the ceramic
composite coating layers (Fmid) and the
interlayer between the separator and the ceramic coating layer (Finter) were evaluated. For every CCS, Finter > Fmid. Finter, which is sensitive to the wet environment,
decreased faster than Fmid when the CCSs
were immersed in a liquid electrolyte.

Experimental Section
Ceramic-Composite
Separator Preparation
To investigate
the effect of binder contents on the ceramic layer adhesion, ceramic-composite
separators were prepared by water-based slurry with different binder
contents. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3, AES-11, Sumitomo
Chemical Co.), disodium laureth sulfosuccinate solution (28 wt % ASCO
DLSS, AK Chemtech Co., Ltd.), and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC,
WS-C, Dai-ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) were used as the ceramic particle,
surfactant, and binder polymer, respectively. The binder amount was
increased from 0.5 to 2.0 wt % by decreasing the Al2O3 content while maintaining the surfactant content at 0.1 wt
% and water content at 60 wt %. Single side of the PE separator was
coated using a simple bar-coating process. The one-side-coated separators
were dried in a fume hood for 10 min (70 °C), followed by further
drying in a vacuum oven (24 h, 60 °C) for the complete removal
of any remaining solvent before use. However, the thickness of the
ceramic layer was maintained at 6 μm to ensure a similar internal
structure. To compare the adhesion properties at each vertical position,
only one control coating slurry (2.0 wt %) was used with the same
procedure. To investigate the adhesion properties at three different
positions (3, 6, and 9 μm), a 10 μm thick ceramic layer
was formed on the PE separator.

Air Permeabilities of Separators
Gurley numbers of
the separators were measured to determine the air permeabilities using
a densometer (4110N, Thwing-Albert).16

Ionic Conductivities of Separators
To measure the ionic
conductivities (σ) of the separators, the liquid electrolyte
(a mixture of 1.15 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/ethyl
methyl carbonate (3:7 by vol., Panax Etec, South Korea))-soaked separators
were sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes (radius = 0.8
cm; area = 2.01 cm2), and the bulk resistance was measured
by alternating current complex impedance analyses (VSP, Bio-Logic).
The ionic conductivities were calculated according to the relationship
σ = l/RS, where l is the separator thickness, S is the contact area
between the separator and the stainless steel blocking electrodes,
and R is the measured bulk resistance.19

Peel Test
The adhesion strength
of the ceramic layer
was measured using a peel tester (Versatile Peel Analyzer, Kyowa,
Japan). For the peel test, 19 mm wide and 50 mm long sample pieces
of 3M adhesive tape were attached to the ceramic-coated separator
and the peel strength was measured. The tape was detached by peeling
at an angle of 90° and a constant displacement rate of 30 mm
min–1; the applied load was continuously measured,
and force/displacement plots were obtained. To guarantee the reproducibility
of the test, we conducted at least three measurements for each sample
and averaged the adhesion strength value.

SAICAS Measurements
The adhesion strength between the
PE separator and the ceramic layer and that at the mid-depth of the
ceramic layer were measured using a SAICAS (Daipla Wintes Co., Ltd,
Japan) with a diamond blade (shear angle = 45°; clearance angle
= 10°; rake angle = 20°; and width of blade = 1 mm). To
measure Fmid and Finter, the vertical force (0.5 N) was applied to the blade
until it reached the region of interest. Then, the vertical force
was removed. During the test, the blade moved horizontally at 2.0
μm s–1.

Morphological Analysis
of Ceramic-Composite Separator
After the peel test and SAICAS
measurements, the surface morphology
of the ceramic-composite separator was characterized by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (S4800, Hitachi, Japan).
