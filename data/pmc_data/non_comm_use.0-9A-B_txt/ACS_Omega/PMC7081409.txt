Divanillin was synthesized in high
yield and purity using Laccase
from Trametes versicolor. It was then
polymerized with benzene-1,4-diamine and 2,7-diaminocarbazole to form
polyazomethines. Polymerizations were performed under microwave irradiation
and without transition-metal-based catalysts. These biobased conjugated
polyazomethines present a broad fluorescence spectrum ranging from
400 to 600 nm. Depending on the co-monomer used, polyazomethines with
molar masses of around 10 kg·mol–1 and with
electronic gaps ranging from 2.66 to 2.85 eV were obtained. Furthermore,
time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were
performed to corroborate the experimental results.

1 Introduction
Thanks
to recent works on the selective oxidative coupling of phenolic
molecules via enzymatic catalysis, a biobased platform of lignin-derived
aromatics is now available.1,2 Among them, vanillin
has a large potential, as it is one of the only phenolic compounds
industrially available from biorefinery.3 Vanillin can be easily dimerized from C–C coupling using
an environmental-friendly process as was demonstrated by Llevot et
al.4 Such divanillin was used as a biobased
aromatic building block for designing semi-aromatic polymers exhibiting
different thermomechanical properties.5 However, divanillin monomer has also the potential to be valorized
in the field of organic electronics.6 Indeed,
in addition to the two phenolic functions, such derivative possesses
two aldehyde moieties that can be involved in condensation reactions,
for instance with amino groups, leading to polyazomethines. Polyazomethines
exhibit many advantages, as they can be obtained through metal-free
polycondensation with water as the only byproduct.7−12 Moreover, polyazomethines can be synthesized under microwave irradiation,
which brings the benefit of being faster and more efficient than conventional
heating.13,14 π-Conjugated polyazomethines present
a good thermal resistance and are stable in air.15,16 They possess electronic properties similar to those of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV), which can be tuned to exhibit
a high absolute fluorescence quantum yield when doped and exhibit
a good chemical and electrochemical resistance.9,15−22 Interestingly, such polymers could be prepared by selecting diamino-functionalized
monomers vs bis-aldehyde divanillin.

In this work, we describe
the synthesis of a divanillin monomer
substituted by alkyl chains and its subsequent polycondensation with
1,4-benzene diamine or 2,7-carbazole diamine. The optical and electrochemical
properties of the so-formed polyazomethines were also investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
6,6-Dihydroxy-5,5-dimethoxy-[1,1-biphenyl]-3,3-dicarboxaldehyde
(divanillin or DV) was synthesized from vanillin at room
temperature using the procedure already described by us (Scheme 1).1 In 1H NMR (Figure S1), the signal at 9.7 ppm corresponds to the two aldehyde protons
and the signals at 7.5 and 7.2 ppm to the aromatic ones. The signal
at 3.8 ppm corresponds to the methoxy groups. The structure of DV was also attested by attenuated total reflectance Fourier
transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) (Figure S2).

Scheme 1 Alkylation of Divanillin with 2-Ethylhexyl Side Chains (DVEH) and Polymerization with p-Phenylenediamine
(P1) and Diamino Carbazole (P2)
To improve the solubility of DV and polyazomethines
thereof in classical organic solvents, the latter was alkylated.9,23,24 Etherification reaction was performed
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence of KOH and 2-ethylhexyl
bromide to give divanillin ethyl hexylated or DVEH (Scheme 1). The alkylation
reaction was assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and ATR-FTIR
(Figures S3 and S4); nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) signals around 3.81 ppm and the signals between 0.69 and 1.39
ppm confirmed the completion of the alkylation reaction.

The
divanillin-based monomer (DVEH) was polymerized
at the stoichiometry ratio 1:1 both with commercially available benzene-1,4-diamine
and 2,7-diaminocarbazole to give, respectively, P1 and P2 (synthesized according to the literature)12 (Scheme 1). The polymerization reaction performed under microwave irradiation
is usually faster than conventional heating.25,26 Silica was added to the reaction medium to remove water and shift
the equilibrium toward the polymer formation. P1A and P2 were obtained after 4 h of reaction and purified by precipitation
in methanol. Interestingly, the use of silica allowed a simple recovery
process of the polyazomethine through filtration before precipitation.
However, silica is not necessary to carry out the polymerization reaction.
Indeed, the synthesis of the polyazomethine was also performed without
silica, in just 5 min instead of 4 h (P1B). The crude
polyazomethine was then dissolved in methylene chloride; methanol
was added and then the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator.
The powder obtained was rinsed with methanol, giving the final product P1C.

The polyazomethines were characterized by NMR and
size exclusion
chromatography (SEC). 1H NMR signal at 8.5 ppm clearly
attested the formation of azomethine bond (−CH=N−)
(Figures S5 and S6). All the molecular
characteristics and thermal and optical properties of DVEH-based polyazomethines are reported in Table 1.

drop-casting on quartz.

SEC traces show discrete peaks at low molar masses, according to
a polycondensation pathway with heavy monomers (Figures S7 and S8). Both polymers have a dispersity close
to 2, which is consistent with a step-growth mechanism (at high conversion).
The two families of polyazomethines present apparent number-average
molar masses M̅n of 10 600
and 6200 g·mol–1, respectively, for P1A and P2 for a reaction time of 4 h. For the polyazomethines P1, a similar molar mass was obtained in just 5 min of reaction
after purification. Interestingly, postcondensation probably occurred
during the purification, resulting in a higher molar mass (10 000
g/mol with 70% yield) compared to the crude. It confirms that postcondensation
occurs during solvent evaporation.

The thermal properties of
polyazomethines were determined by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of
10 °C·min–1. All polyazomethines present
good thermal stability with a degradation temperature of around 405
°C (Figures S9 and S10). The diamine
used does not have a significant impact on the thermal stability.
In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses carried
out between −80 and 200 °C did not show any specific transition
neither glass transition nor crystallinity behavior, indicating the
very rigid structure of these polyazomethines and their probable amorphous
state (see Figures S11 and S12).

All the polyazomethines were characterized by UV–vis absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopy analyses. As shown in Figure 1, the carbazole-based polyazomethine’s
main absorption band is red-shifted as compared to that of the phenyl-based
derivative from 364 to 390 nm. This behavior could be due to a stronger
electron-rich/electron-poor coupling in the case of the carbazolylene
derivative or to a more planar conformation increasing the conjugation
length. It is even amplified in fluorescence spectra where the shift
can reach 150 nm. This is coherent with the higher molar attenuation
coefficient of carbazole compared to the that of bisvanillin.27 Both P1 and P2 have
a weak emission, with a fluorescence quantum yield below 2% in the
solution.

Figure 1 Absorption spectra (top) and emission spectra (excited at 360 nm,
bottom) of the two DVEH-based polyazomethines P1A and P2 in methylene chloride.

Electrochemical features of these polyazomethines were determined
by cyclic voltammetry using dichloromethane solutions of tetrabutylammonium
hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as an electrolyte, silver
as a reference electrode, and platinum as a working and counter electrodes.
Finally, the material was solubilized in the electrolyte solution
at a concentration of 0.1 g·L-1 (Figures S13 and S14). The values of the energy
levels are indicated in Table 2.

c Calculated by the Tauc method.

d Calculated by B3LYP/6-31(d,p) level
of theory.

The slight differences
between the electrochemical and optical
band gaps can be explained by the fact that the redox peaks result
from localized sites rather than from the conjugated backbone.28 For the 1,4-diaminobenzene-based polyazomethines,
both optical and electrochemical gaps are comparable within experimental
errors, with a value of around 2.67 eV for the electrochemical gap
and 2.96 eV for the optical one.

In the case of carbazole-based
polyazomethine, these values reach,
respectively, 2.66 and 2.85 eV. These gap reductions are coherent
with the red-shift observed in both absorption and emission spectra.

Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on DV-Ph and DV-Cbz derivatives at B3LYP/6-31 (d,p)
level of theory with chloroform as an implicit solvent conductor-like
polarizable continuum model (CPCM). Different angles in both molecules
were first estimated (Figures S15 and S16 and Table S1). The choice of DFT functional employed is based on
the closeness of the calculated electronic band gap (EG = EHOMO – ELUMO) of monomers (as a function of different
DFT functionals employed, see Table S2 for
more details) with respect to the experimental values determined by
cyclic voltammetry (Table S3). DV-Cbz derivative shows lower EG compared to
that of DV-Ph derivative as reported in Table 2.

Furthermore, Khun’s
model was employed to compute the electronic
band gap at polymer limit (eq 1).29,30 1  When n → ∞, n is the number of monomer units in the oligomer, E0 is to electronic transition energy when N = 1, N is the number of double bonds
along the shortest conjugated pathway between terminal carbon atoms
for oligomers of size n (Figure S17). Dk is the force constant
that represents the strength of coupling between single and double
bonds, implicitly linked to the efficiency of connection between the
units in an oligomer. By plotting EG as
a function of the number of double bonds (N), it
exhibits higher π-conjugation of DV-Cbz derivative,
suggesting a better delocalization of π electrons31 with respect to DV-Ph derivatives,
with the values of Dk as 0.818 and 0.748,
respectively (Table S4). These results
are in agreement with the experimental data.

3 Conclusions
The synthesis of different polyazomethines embedding divanillin
biobased platform was performed. Divanillin was synthesized and alkylated
and then polymerized with two different diamines: 1,4-benzene diamine
and an alkylated 2,7-diaminocarbazole. The polymerization was performed
under microwave irradiation, without any metallic catalyst and with
water as the only byproduct. Remarkably, all polyazomethines present
a broad emission at the beginning of the visible range. The carbazole-based
polyazomethine is red-shifted compared to the phenyl-based one in
the case of both absorption and emission. This bathochromic shift
is expected as the carbazole moiety is more electron-donating than
the phenyl one. Interestingly, the methodology followed meets some
challenges for a “green chemistry” such as lowering
the number of steps, avoiding transition-metal catalyst, and use of
biobased monomers to quote a few. In addition, these new polyazomethines
have promising properties (confirmed by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)
calculations) for optoelectronic applications like an organic light-emitting
diode (OLED) for example.

These encouraging results pave the
way for a whole family of biobased
π-conjugated polyazomethines. Optical properties can be enhanced
by optimizing the structure and/or by playing on doping. The extension
to other π-conjugated moieties is currently investigated. Furthermore,
for a better understanding of optical and electrical properties, small
model trimers and dimers will be isolated and fully characterized.
All these new developments will be discussed in forthcoming papers.

4 Experimental Section
4.1. Materials
Vanillin (>97%),
laccase from Trametes versicolor, and
2-ethyl hexyl bromide (95%)
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. para-Toluene sulfonic
acid (PTSA, 99%) was purchased from TCI. Silica gel (pore size 60
Å, 230–400 mesh particle size, particle size 40–63
μm) was obtained from Honeywell Fluka. All products and solvents
(reagent grade) were used as received except otherwise mentioned.
The solvents were of reagent grade quality and purified wherever necessary
according to the methods reported in the literature. Flash chromatography
was performed on a Grace Reveleris apparatus, employing silica cartridges
from Grace. Cyclohexane: ethyl acetate gradients were used as eluents.
The detection was performed through ELSD and UV detectors at 254 and
280 nm. The reactions under microwave irradiation were performed on
a Discover-SP from CEM, with the temperature measured by infrared;
the power of the apparatus is constantly adjusted to reach and then
stay at the set temperature.

4.2. Characterization Techniques
1H, 13C, and 1H–13C HSQC NMR measurements
were performed with a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer (400.20 and 100.63
MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively) at room temperature
using a deuterated solvent.

IR spectra were recorded with a
Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer using a 0.6 mm diameter beam. The samples
were analyzed with the attenuated total reflexion (ATR) method.

High-resolution mass spectroscopy analyses were performed on an
AutoSpec-Waters spectrometer (EI).

Optical absorption spectra
were obtained with a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(UV-3600, Shimadzu). Photoluminescence spectra were obtained from
a spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax-4, Horiba Scientific).

Molar
masses of polymers P1A, P1B, and P1C measured in THF were determined by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) using a three-column set of Resipore Agilent: one guard column
Resipore Agilent PL1113-1300, then two-column Resipore Agilent PL1113-6300,
connected in series, and calibrated with narrow polystyrene standards
from Polymer Laboratories using both refractometric (GPS 2155) and
UV detectors (Viscotek). THF was used as an eluent (0.8 mL·min–1) and trichlorobenzene as a flow marker (0.15%) at
30 °C.

Molar masses of polymer P2 measured
in THF were determined
by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a three-column set of
TSK gel TOSOH (G2000, G3000, G4000 with pore sizes of 20, 75, and
200 Å, respectively, connected in series) calibrated with narrow
polystyrene standards from Polymer Laboratories using both refractometric
and UV detectors (Varian). THF was used as eluent (1 mL/min) and trichlorobenzene
as a flow marker at 40 °C.

Molar masses of polymer samples
in CHCl3 were measured
by SEC at 40 °C with THF as an eluent, using a Viscotek VE2001-GPC.
Polymer Laboratories-Varian (one guard column and three columns based
on cross-linked polystyrene, pore sizes = 200, 75, and 20 Å),
and PS standards were used for calibration.

TGA was performed
on a TA-Q50, from 25 to 600–700 °C
with the heating of 10 °C·min–1 under
nitrogen flow.

DSC analysis was performed on a TA instrument
under a helium flow,
with an LN2 cooling and modulated with ±0.64 °C every 60
s. The sample was heated at 10 °C·min–1 and cooled down at 5 °C·min–1.

Electrochemical measurements and highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) calculations were
performed in a solution. A solution of 0.1 g·L–1 of the investigated polymer in CH2Cl2 with
0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as an electrolyte
was prepared. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were then performed
on the solution using silver wire as the reference electrode and platinum
as the working and counter electrodes. A solution of ferrocene (1
mM in the same solvent) was prepared in the same conditions and the
redox potential of Fc/Fc+ vs Ag (EFc/Fc+ Ag) was measured, to be used
as a reference for calibration.

4.3. Synthesis of 6,6′-Dihydroxy-5,5′-dimethoxy[1,1′-biphenyl]-3,3′-dicarboxaldehyde
(Divanillin or DV)
A solution of vanillin in
acetone was added to acetate buffer saturated in oxygen with laccase
from T. versicolor. In these conditions,
the dimer formed precipitates and can be recovered by simple filtration.
The filtrate was then simply reloaded in vanillin and oxygen to start
again the synthesis. Yield: 85%.

previously dried DMSO. Then, KOH (0.89 mg, 15.9 mmol) was added to
the reaction mixture, which was heated at 80 °C for 2 h. Then,
2.2 equiv of 2-ethylhexyl bromide was added to the reaction mixture
and heated for 12 more hours. The reaction mixture was then poured
into 300 mL of water and extracted with 100 mL of diethyl ether three
times. The crude product recovered after the diethyl ether evaporation
was purified with flash chromatography in a mixture of cyclohexane/ethyl
acetate (95/5).

a stoichiometric
amount of p-phenylenediamine or 2,7-diaminocarbazole
and the previously synthesized DVEH is put in a suspension
of 5 mL of toluene. Silica (300 mg) was then added with the catalytic
amount of PTSA and the reaction heated at 130 °C for 4 h using
microwave irradiation. The crude polymer was then precipitated in
methanol to afford the final polymers unless specified otherwise.

4.6. Synthesis of Polyazomethine P1B and P1C
In a 10 mL microwave-dedicated glassware, a stoichiometric
amount of p-phenylenediamine and the previously synthesized DVEH is put in the suspension of 5 mL of toluene. A catalytic
amount of PTSA was then added and the reaction heated at 130 °C
for 5 min using microwave irradiation. The solvent is then removed
from the crude mixture to give the crude polymer (P1B). This crude is then dissolved in a minimum amount of methylene
chloride, and 100 mL of methanol was added. The solution turns cloudy.
The solvents are then evaporated using a rotary evaporator to obtain
a yellow powder, which is rinsed with methanol to give the final polymer P1C.
