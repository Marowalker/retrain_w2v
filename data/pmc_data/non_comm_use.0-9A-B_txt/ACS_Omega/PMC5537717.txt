The use of a nanoparticle (NP)-based
antitumor drug carrier has been an emerging strategy for selectively
delivering the drugs to the tumor area and, thus, reducing the side
effects that are associated with a high systemic dose of antitumor
drugs. Precise control of drug loading and release is critical so
as to maximize the therapeutic index of the NPs. Here, we propose
a simple method of synthesizing NPs with tunable drug release while
maintaining their loading ability, by varying the polymer matrix density
of amine- or carboxyl-functionalized hydrogel NPs. We find that the
NPs with a loose matrix released more cisplatin, with up to a 33 times
faster rate. Also, carboxyl-functionalized NPs loaded more cisplatin
and released it at a faster rate than amine-functionalized NPs. We
performed detailed Monte Carlo computer simulations that elucidate
the relation between the matrix density and drug release kinetics.
We found good agreement between the simulation model and the experimental
results for drug release as a function of time. Also, we compared
the cellular uptake between amine-functionalized NPs and carboxyl-functionalized
NPs, as a higher cellular uptake of NPs leads to improved cisplatin
delivery. The amine-functionalized NPs can deliver 3.5 times more
cisplatin into cells than the carboxyl-functionalized NPs. The cytotoxic
efficacy of both the amine-functionalized NPs and the carboxyl-functionalized
NPs showed a strong correlation with the cisplatin release profile,
and the latter showed a strong correlation with the NP matrix density.

==== Body
Introduction
The tuning of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is always a
challenge in the drug development and formulation process. The idea
of delivering the desired concentration of drugs into targeted locations
in the body over time utilizing nanoparticles (NPs) has attracted
the attention of many people. This is especially true in the field
of cancer therapy, vaccine, and tissue regeneration because of the
tissue-targeting ability of the NPs and the tunable release of drugs
inside of the NPs.1,2

Many groups have developed
various types of nanoplatforms for drug delivery, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA),3 hyaluronic
acid,4 lipids,5−7 or block copolymers.8,9 Our
group has made various types of polyacrylamide-based NPs (PAA-NPs)
for cancer diagnosis10−14 and therapy14−17 because
of their ideal characteristics as a platform drug delivery system.
PAA-NPs have proven to be biocompatible both in vitro and in vivo.15,18 In addition, the hydrophilicity and the surface charge of PAA-NPs
can be easily manipulated by changing the type and relative ratio
of acrylamide derivative monomers in the synthesis.19 Such high engineerability also allows the conjugation of
many different types of cancer-targeting moieties onto the surface
of PAA-NPs for active targeting.15,20 We previously
showed that hydrogel NPs loaded with cisplatin, an antitumor drug,
could target SKOV3 ovarian cancer, and they successfully shrunk the
tumor size, whereas free cisplatin had no effect at all on the tumor
growth because of the known cisplatin resistance of the tumor.15,21

Kinetically controlled release of drugs is important for optimal
drug delivery so that the NPs do not release drugs while still circulating
in the blood stream and cause side effects but release most of the
drugs when reaching the targeted area.5 Such a temporally and spatially controlled release behavior can
avoid, or at least reduce, the side effects that are associated with
globally high doses of the drug.20

Temporally controlled delivery can be achieved by changing the matrix
mesh size, porosity, tortuosity, and/or hydration rate.22,23 In hydrogel-based drug delivery systems, the mesh size plays an
important role.20,24,25 The
mesh size (ξ), which is the distance between two polymeric chain
cross-linkers, can be defined by eq 1(24) 1  Here, Q is the swell ratio of the matrix, Cn is the Flory characteristic ratio of the
hydrogel, which describes the flexibility of the chain,26 is the average molecular
weight of a chain between cross-linkers, and Mr is the molecular weight of a repeating unit. NPs with a bigger
mesh size release the drugs faster.25 Zhou
et al. reported the control of the release profile of various small
molecules using the layer-by-layer coating of polyethylenimine and
acrylic acid (AA).27

The cross-linkers
can be classified into two types: chemical and physical ones. In typical
hydrogel NPs, they coexist.23 Chemical
cross-linkers, such as tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate,24 or poly(ethylene glycol)dimethacrylate,28 form rigid connections between polymer chains
via covalent bonding. On the other hand, physical cross-linkers form
weak and reversible connections.23 Some
examples are hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and crystallite formations.23

A typical approach to change the mesh
size (i.e., tune the drug release kinetics) is by varying the relative
ratio of “chemical” cross-linkers to monomers in the
hydrogel.24,28 This approach changes the distance between
the cross-linkers by varying the number of chemical cross-linkers
and the mole fraction of cross-linkers.

Here, we changed the
mesh size of the PAA-NPs by varying the “physical” cross-linking
while maintaining the degrees of chemical cross-linking and evaluated
their drug release profiles. The adjustment of the physical cross-linking
was achieved by changing the polymer matrix density. Even though the
effect of hydrogel density on the drug release profile has been previously
studied in bulk hydrogel,23 to the best
of our knowledge, this concept has not been extensively studied in
NPs. With the NPs prepared in the above-mentioned way, one can change
the mesh size more drastically than by the method of adjusting the
ratio of the chemical cross-linkers because a drastic reduction of
chemical cross-linkers typically ends up in an unstable nanoparticle
structure.29

A reverse micelle polymerization
method was utilized for the synthesis of PAA-NPs with similar size
but different matrix densities because this method controls the size
of the NPs by the formed micelle size, but little by the NP ingredients,
within the range of concentrations of NP ingredients we employed in
this study.15,30

Utilizing this system,
we evaluated the effect of changing the polymer matrix density of
the NPs on drug release profile, using an antitumor drug, cisplatin,
as a model drug in two commonly used forms of PAA-NPs as NP models:
amine-functionalized and carboxyl-functionalized.15,19,31 Amine-functionalized NPs are widely used
for their high cellular uptake and ease of chemical conjugation,13−16 whereas
carboxyl-functionalized NPs are reported to be able to chemically
and reversibly conjugate cisplatin into their matrix.31 We thus chose to evaluate NPs with these two matrices.
Carboxyl-functionalized NPs loaded more cisplatin and released more
cisplatin, per gram of NPs, in a given time, than amine-functionalized
NPs. Also, for further detailed understanding of drug release from
the polymer matrix, Monte Carlo computer simulations were performed.
Notably, however, the synthesized NPs showed similar cisplatin-loading
capacities regardless of the polymer matrix density, but, on the other
hand, the kinetics of their cisplatin release showed an inverse relationship
with the polymer matrix density, for both types of NPs. In other words,
we were able to successfully change the release profile of cisplatin
from the NPs while maintaining their drug-loading ability. Also, we
evaluated the effect of different surface functionalizations of the
NPs on their cellular uptake, the cellular uptake being another important
aspect of the cytotoxicity of NPs. We investigated both NP cell uptake
and the cytotoxicity on a cisplatin-resistant cell line, SKOV3.15 We found that the NP surface
groups with a negative charge resulted in enhanced NP cell uptake,
which enhances the cytotoxicity (as does the improved drug release),
requiring one to make a balanced choice as to the optimization of
cell kill efficacy.

Results and Discussion
The cisplatin-loaded NPs were prepared in two steps: (1) synthesis
of blank NPs and (2) postloading of cisplatin into the blank NPs.
In the postloading method, blank NPs were mixed with a high concentration
of cisplatin—which would disrupt the microemulsion system for
the preloading method used in our previous synthesis15—enabling a high loading of cisplatin.

Temperature Dependence of Cisplatin Loading
To efficiently load cisplatin into the NPs, we investigated the effect
of the loading temperature on the wt % loading of cisplatin, which
is defined by eq 2. We
compared the loading of cisplatin at two different temperatures, for
amine-functionalized NPs, utilizing the blank p[acrylamide (AAm)-co-N-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide (APMA)]
NPs. High temperature is known to help in improving the loading efficiency
and to prevent the potential aggregation of NPs during the loading.4 When cisplatin was loaded at room temperature
(22 °C), the loading of cisplatin was 0.58%, whereas when cisplatin
was loaded into NPs at higher temperature (90 °C), the temperature
reported by the Howell group,4 the loading
was 5.63%. Thus, almost 10 times higher loading of cisplatin was achieved
at the elevated loading temperature. The higher the temperature, the
more flexible the NP matrix becomes; thus, the cisplatin molecules
can migrate further inside of the hydrogel NPs.31 A similar temperature dependency of cisplatin loading was
observed for carboxyl-functionalized NPs, which is consistent with
the work previously reported by the Howell group using a carboxyl
acid containing sugar, hyaluronic acid, as a carrier of cisplatin.4 Because of this high loading, we chose 90 °C
as the loading temperature for the rest of the experiments.

Synthesis of PAA-NPs of Varying Polymer Matrix
Densities
To adjust the polymer matrix density, NPs were
synthesized with the reverse micelle (water-in-oil) emulsion method
(Scheme 1A). In our
system, the nanosized water droplets, which contained monomers and
cross-linkers (Table 1A), were coated by surfactants in the hexane bath. Free-radical polymerization
was performed so as to form NPs inside of the water droplets. The
size of the synthesized NPs was determined by the ratio among the
water phase, hexane phase, and surfactants. In this way, we can tune
the matrix density of the synthesized NPs by changing the NP ingredient
concentration (Table 1B) in the water droplet while unchanging the size and molar composition
of the synthesized NPs to be constant (Table 1A).

a (A) Composition
of NPs in different categories; (B) Three different densities for
each distinct composition of NPs.

The compositions of the NPs and
their estimated matrix densities are summarized in Table 1. For each of the compositions
of the NPs, three different concentrations of the reaction ingredients
in the water phase were employed. The NP polymer matrix density in Table 1B is estimated by
the following equation 2  Here, ρ is
the polymer matrix density (A.U.), A is the weight
of the hydrogel-forming ingredients, and B is the
weight of aqueous solvent during the synthesis (1.3 mL of water and
1 mL of water and 0.77 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) for amine-functionalized
NPs and carboxyl-functionalized NPs, respectively).

Loading of Cisplatin to p(AAm-co-APMA) of Varying Polymer Matrix Densities
First, p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs of three different matrix densities were synthesized
(Scheme 1B) and were
loaded with cisplatin. The results of the loading are summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, the
wt % loading of cisplatin did not change with the variation in the
matrix density. The size of the NPs shrunk after being loaded with
cisplatin, possibly because cisplatin screens the electrostatic repulsion
between the positive amine-functionalized chains of the matrix,23 or cisplatin may act as a cross-linker that
weakly connects the matrix chains by van der Waals forces.

Table 2 Cisplatin Loading to the p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs with Different Polymer Matrix Densitiesa

(±0.07)	35.9 (±6.5)	5.2 (±0.7)	
a The densities of NPs are defined by percentage, using eq 2. PDI, polydispersity index.

Next,
we confirmed that the shrinkage of the size was not due to the degradation
of NPs. The size of blank NPs (no cisplatin) actually slightly increased,
from 51 (±1) nm with PDI of 0.11 (±0.01) to 70 (±1)
nm with PDI of 0.17 (±0.01), after these NPs were exposed to
90 °C for 4 h.

The sizes of the cisplatin-loaded NPs of
different matrix densities were similar, as expected, because the
sizes of the micelles during the synthesis were also similar. No notable
change of ζ-potential was observed after the loading of cisplatin.

Release Profile of Cisplatin-Loaded p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs
The release profiles of cisplatin
from p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs of different matrix densities
were investigated (Figure 1). The cisplatin-loaded 8.4% NPs showed significantly higher
percentage release of cisplatin than cisplatin-loaded 31% and cisplatin-loaded
48%, which results from the loose matrix structure. However, we did
not observe a significant difference in the % release of cisplatin
between 48% NPs and 31% NPs. The change in the polymer matrix density
from 48 to 31% may not be significant enough to observe a notable
change in the release profile. We did not observe complete release
in any of the formulations we tested, probably because some cisplatin
molecules are buried deep inside of the matrix, where the interaction
between the cisplatin molecules and the matrix is stronger than in
the area closer to the surface. However, it is reported that the drugs
slowly released over time even with a rigid matrix; therefore, it
is expected that the cisplatin release continues over time.27

Figure 1 Cisplatin release from
cisplatin-loaded p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs over time. The
dots represent the experimental data, whereas the lines represent
the fitted curve, using eq 3. Percentage representation of NPs shows different polymer
matrix densities. Note that the absolute release pattern is similar
to the % release pattern, within error, due to the similar loadings
of the three NP classes, that is, the 8.4% NPs give the highest release,
by far.

To further quantitatively evaluate the
result, the Peppas equation32 was applied
to fit each of the release curves and thus calculate the effective
diffusion coefficient (D). The data fit is shown
in Figure 1. 3  Here,  represents
the release ratio at time t, D is
the effective diffusion coefficient of cisplatin, a is the radius of the NPs, and C is the fraction
of cisplatin that is released during the initial burst release.

The calculated diffusion coefficients D are summarized
in Table 3. The 8.4%
NPs have the highest value of D. This may be attributed
to the 8.4% NPs having the lowest density. The non-monotonicity of
the three D values might be attributed to the small R2 value for the 31% NPs. Expectedly, as the
density of the NPs goes down, the diffusion coefficient of cisplatin
increases.

Construction of p(AAm-co-AA) NPs
As a next step, we chemically conjugate
cisplatin to NPs to increase the cisplatin loading by using a carboxyl
acid containing monomer, AA, as one of the ingredients of the NPs.31 We prepared the p(AAm-co-AA)
NPs so as to evaluate the effect of the functional group, in the acrylamide
derivative monomer, on the loading and release of cisplatin (Scheme 1C). It has been reported
that cisplatin chemically binds to the carboxyl groups in the absence
of the Cl1– ion (Scheme 1D).33 In the presence
of Cl1–, such as in the body, or in the presence
of H3O+, such as inside cellular lysosomes,
the carboxyl group, initially binding to the platinum center of the
cisplatin, was replaced by Cl– or H3O+, which results in the release of cisplatin from the NPs.31,34

Initially, we constructed NPs by using the same composition
as for the p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs, except substituting
APMA with AA, without changing the molar ratio of the composing ingredients
[p(AAm-co-AA) #1 of Table 1]. Into these NPs, cisplatin could not be
loaded either at room temperature or at higher temperatures. These
NPs formed aggregates during the loading procedure, possibly due to
the loss of surface charge, presumably because of too much consumption
of carboxylic groups by cisplatin. Therefore, the molar percentage
of AA was increased (2.5 to 15%), whereas the amount of cross-linkers
was reduced from 16 to 13% so as to increase the stability of p(AAm-co-AA) #2, as shown in Table 1. The NPs of the modified composition were also prepared
at three different matrix densities, and then, we loaded cisplatin
into these NPs.

When cisplatin was loaded into the above NPs
at high temperature, no aggregation was observed, whereas for the
loading at room temperature, aggregation of the NPs was observed.
Also, it was reported34,35 that cisplatin can be more easily
loaded into the carboxyl group containing NPs under basic conditions.
Therefore, cisplatin was loaded into NPs in the presence of 25 mM
NaOH. The results of the loading are summarized in Table 4. The sizes of the NPs were
measured after loading with cisplatin. The 21% NPs and 34% NPs showed
relatively similar NP sizes (Table 4). On the other hand, the 4.9% NPs had considerably
larger sizes than the other two NPs. This could be because of the
swelling of the NPs because of the low cross-linking of their matrix,
as well as their high negative charge in the aqueous solvent, where
there is no surfactant to restrict their size. Because the 4.9% NPs
are 4 times bigger in size than the other NPs (Table 4), the density of 4.9% is expected to be
8 times lower than the theoretical density.

a The densities of
the NPs are defined by percentage using eq 2.

To understand the
relationship of the polymer matrix density and the diffusion coefficient,
the cisplatin release profiles of the 21% NPs and 34% NPs, which have
similar NP sizes, were evaluated (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Cisplatin release from cisplatin-loaded p(AAm-co-AA) NPs over time. The dots represent the experimental
data, whereas the lines represent the fitted curves, using eq 3. Percentage representation
of NPs shows different polymer matrix densities. The experimental
data, up to 24 h, were used to fit the data. The original (time 0)
cisplatin concentrations are given in Table 6.

As we observed in the case of the
p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs, 21% NPs released more cisplatin
than the 34% overall. The effective diffusion coefficients (D) of the NPs were calculated, using eq 3, so as to understand the relationship between
the polymer matrix density of the NPs and their effective diffusion
coefficient. To calculate the effective diffusion coefficient, the
released cisplatin at each time point was subtracted from the percentage
of cisplatin released during the initial burst.

The 34% NPs
had a smaller effective diffusion coefficient than the 21% NPs, which
is consistent with our intended NP design and their release profile
data (Figure 2). Also,
confirming our expectations, carboxyl-functionalized NPs of lower
polymer matrix density release cisplatin at a faster rate. These observations
give some new insights into the swelling behavior of environment-responsive
NPs. The polymer matrix density had an inverse correlation with the
release kinetics (or mesh size), and this indicates the potency of
upper critical solution-like NPs as drug carriers.31 On the other hand, the 21% NPs had an initial burst release
of cisplatin, possibly due to their loose matrix. We are not aware
of a theory explaining this burst release.36 This implies that the initial burst release is a phenomenon that
is inversely correlated with the polymer matrix density. It indicates
that a similar burst release might occur in environment-responsive
NPs, and environment-responsive NPs might release a significant amount
of drugs rapidly, immediately after the surrounding environment changes.

We then evaluated the release profile of the 4.9% NPs to understand
the effect of the larger size of these NPs. The 4.9% NPs had 1.1%
of initial burst release and released 10% of the cisplatin inside
within 72 h. The 4.9% NPs had a higher effective diffusion coefficient,
whereas the 21% NPs showed the fastest release kinetics. The latter
is presumably due to the size difference between the 4.9% NPs and
21% NPs; the 4.9% NPs are 2.5 times larger than the 21% NPs, on average
(Table 5). The larger
size of an NP slows down the release kinetics from that NP because
the cisplatin molecules need to migrate over a longer distance inside
of the NP (eq 3).

Simulation Methods and Results
We
now perform computer simulations for the processes described in the
previous sections, as an alternate approach for monitoring the rate
of the drug release. Simulations of this type have been extensively
performed in the past,37,38 albeit for different experimental
systems. We briefly describe here the model used. We consider a matrix
made of a two-dimensional square lattice of size L × L sites, where L is the
length of the square. Drug particles (cisplatin molecules) are randomly
placed on the lattice sites and are allowed to diffuse with time,
taking steps only to adjacent sites. If a drug molecule reaches the
perimeter of the matrix, then it is permanently removed from the system.
A certain number of the lattice sites are designated as obstacles,
meaning that they are blocked sites that are hindering the particle
motion. These obstacles give a measure of the difficulty that the
moving molecules have on their way to be released by reaching the
lattice perimeter. They can also be thought of as a measure of the
mobility of the drug molecules. Thus, if a drug particle diffuses
toward a blocked site, then it must bounce back and must subsequently
find an open site to diffuse into. The drug particles are randomly
placed on lattice sites with the initial drug concentration ρ0, avoiding double occupancy. Particle diffusion is simulated
by selecting particles at random and moving them randomly to one of
the nearest-neighbor sites. A particle is removed from the system
when it migrates through one of the perimeter sites. The obstacle
sites are also randomly distributed in the system with concentration
ρs. Time is counted in Monte Carlo steps, where one
(1) such step constitutes one movement, on the average, for all particles
present. We monitor the number of particles released from the system
as a function of time. We average the results over 100 different realizations.

To see the effect of the obstacles during diffusion, we simulate
the drug release for several different concentrations ρs. We show the results in Figure 3. We use an initial concentration of drug
particles, ρ0 = 0.02, and we vary ρs. We observe that as ρs is increased the drug released
is decreased, and interestingly, it reaches a plateau for values of
obstacles ρs > 0.50.

Figure 3 Drug Release Fraction
vs time, for several values
of ρs, which expresses the polymer matrix density.
We used a square lattice with L = 100. The initial
concentration of particles (equivalent to drug loading) is ρ0 = 0.02.

The concentration (mole
fraction) of cisplatin molecules (drug) in the simulation was chosen
to be the same as the experimental data, by using Table 6. Note that these mol % data
express the input fraction of the drug/(drug + monomer + cross-linker).
We now use the following parameters, ρ0 = 0.02 and
ρs equal to the matrix density of the NPs, in an
effort to simulate the experimental system. For the amine-functionalized
NPs, we have five points of experimental data for three different
matrix densities (0.084, 0.31, and 0.48). Each point is the fraction
of cisplatin released after a certain amount of time (h). To have
a common normalization, we divide the experimental data by 10 (this
is similar to dividing the simulation results by 10 and the experimental
data by 100). We then fit one point of the experiment with one point
of the simulation. For example, for the experimental point (12, 0.1039),
if the simulation point of 0.1039 release is achieved after 258 Monte
Carlo steps, we normalize by multiplying the simulation time by 12/258.
Finally, we subtract the initial burst release (release at time zero)
from all experimental values to achieve zero release at zero time.

In Figure 4, we
present the results for ρs = 0.084, 0.31, and 0.48.
The NP sizes are 41 (±5), 37 (±1), and 55 (±9) nm.
To simulate the different NP sizes, we used different lattice sizes
(L = 100, 90, and 134), assuming that 41 nm corresponds
to L = 100. We can clearly see that the simulation
is in good agreement with the experiment for the cases of matrix densities
equal to 0.084 and 0.310. For the matrix density of 0.480, the agreement
is good at early times, but not so good at later times. This may happen
due to the fact that in our simulation, when the concentration of
obstacles is too large, many particles stay totally (or almost totally)
trapped and cannot escape the lattice. It is likely that a similar
phenomenon occurs in the experiment but for lower values of matrix
density than in the simulation.

Figure 4 Drug Release Fraction vs time, for ρs = 0.084, 0.31, and 0.48. The initial concentration of particles
is ρ0 = 0.02. The points are the experimental measurements,
whereas the lines are the computer simulations.

In addition to the parameter
values reported here, we used different values for the initial particle
concentration ρ0 = 0.20 and 0.50. We also tried different
lattice sizes L = 50, 100, and 200. Last, we tried
subtracting the initial burst release from the rest of the values.
For all of the above, the results show similar patterns.

Comparing the Cellular Uptake of Amine-Functionalized
NPs and Carboxyl-Functionalized NPs
Cellular uptake is another
important aspect of designing a highly effective drug delivery system
because releasing drugs inside of the cells means that drugs are released
closer to the site of action, as well as that the NPs may overcome
the multidrug resistance of cancer cells.39,40 We
evaluated how the difference in the surface of NPs affects the cellular
uptake. The cellular uptake of cisplatin was compared between cisplatin-loaded
31% p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs and cisplatin-loaded 21% p(AAm-co-AA) NPs, where the percentages refer to the polymer matrix
density defined by eq 2 (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Cellular uptake
study
of cisplatin from positively charged NPs and negatively charged NPs.
The data are normalized to the cellular uptake of p(AAm-co-AA). The 31% p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs and 21% p(AAm-co-AA) NPs were picked for the experiment; the percentages
refer to the polymer matrix density.

There is an almost 3.5 times higher uptake of cisplatin when p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs were used as drug carriers than when p(AAm-co-AA) NPs were used. This higher cellular uptake of p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs is probably due to the preferable interaction
of amine-functionalized NPs with cellular membranes by electrostatic
interactions, as well as by the enhancement by albumin.41,42 It should be noted that the possibility of agglomeration was evaluated
in complete RPMI using 48% p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs as
representative NPs. Even though the size has been increased from 63
nm (Table 2) to 114
(±2 nm) with a PDI of 0.26 (±0.01) because of the formation
of a protein–NP complex, no sign of severe agglomeration was
observed.42

We also calculated the
absolute cisplatin uptake of SKOV3 to be 22 (±8 fg/cells) and
9.0 (±7 fg/cells) for p(AAm-co-APMA) and p(AAm-co-AA), respectively. This corresponds to less than 0.18%
of the incubating cisplatin, typically of what has been previously
observed to happen.43

Cytotoxicity of Cisplatin-Loaded NPs
Finally,
the cytotoxicity of blank (Figures S1 and S3) and cisplatin-loaded (Figures S4 and S5) p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs and p(AAm-co-AA) NPs was evaluated. No significant indication of cytotoxicity
was observed from the NPs in the absence of cisplatin. On the other
hand, cisplatin-loaded NPs showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity, and
p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs showed a clear dependency of their
cytotoxicity. Also, the cytotoxicity of free cisplatin was evaluated
(Figure S2). The calculated IC50 was 0.7 μg/mL.

The difference in the cellular uptake
(Figure 5) seems to
explain the similarity of IC50 of p(AAm-co-AA) NPs to that of p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs (Figures S4 and S5), regardless of the significant
difference in the release profiles. The 3.5 times difference in the
NP cellular uptake between these two NP formulations could be the
reason for their equal cytotoxic effect even though the p(AAm-co-AA) NPs can release 5 times more cisplatin in 72 h than
the p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs. The higher release per NP
appears to be compensated by a higher NP uptake.

Summary and Conclusions
Controlling the release
kinetics from NPs is important for improving the efficacy of drugs
and reducing the side effects. Specifically, our interest was to evaluate
how tuning of the NP matrix density, which controls the mesh size
of the NP matrix, controls the release profile of cisplatin from hydrogel
NPs. This issue was elucidated by both experiment and simulations,
which illustrate quantitatively the relation between the matrix density
and the drug release rate. Both methods show an initial fast release
at early times, which slows down at later times, and they are in good
agreement. Experimentally, we used a simple method of changing the
polymer matrix density, utilizing reverse micelle polymerization.
Two different formulations, the amine-functionalized NPs [p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs] and the carboxyl-functionalized NPs [p(AAm-co-AA) NPs], were tested for their release profile and cellular
uptake as a function of their polymer matrix density, as defined by eq 2. Both formulations showed
high cisplatin loading, and the change in the polymer matrix density
did not cause a change in the loading ability. Also, both formulations
showed an inverse relationship between their polymer matrix density
and their effective cisplatin diffusion coefficient, a critical factor
that determines the release kinetics from NPs. The NPs with a loose
matrix showed up to 33 times faster cisplatin diffusion in the matrix,
that is, faster release. The p(AAm-co-AA) NPs had
a higher loading of cisplatin, as well as a faster and higher release
of cisplatin, than the p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs. However,
the p(AAm-co-AA) NPs made with a low polymer matrix
density had a higher initial burst release. In case the burst release
is an undesirable characteristic for potential clinical applications,
one method to prevent this problem is to prewash the NPs with a solvent
close to the physiological condition so as to remove the cisplatin
that contributes to the burst release.36 The p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs showed 3.5 times higher
cellular uptake than the p(AAm-co-AA) NPs presumably
because of their amine functionalization, which can facilitate the
cellular uptake via an electrostatic interaction with cell membranes,
as well as because of potential assistance by albumin.41,42 A precise control of the drug release, which can be achieved by
controlling the NP polymer matrix density, as well as the cellular
uptake, should enhance the efficacy of NP-assisted chemotherapy. Our
cell toxicity study showed some correlation between the matrix densities
of the NPs with the drug efficacy. No difference in drug efficacy
was observed between p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs and p(AAm-co-AA) NPs, presumably because the high cell uptake of the
amine-functionalized NPs, the p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs,
was compensated by the higher cisplatin release of the carboxyl-functionalized
NPs, the p(AAm-co-AA) NPs.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
Cisplatin was purchased from Selleck Chemicals LLC. RPMI growth
medium was purchased from Invitrogen. N-(3-Aminopropyl)methacrylamide
was purchased from Polysciences, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. The deionized (DI) water used in this experiment
was purified prior to the experiment, using a Milli-Q system from
Millipore.

Preparation of Blank Poly(AAm-co-APMA) NPs
P(AAm-co-APMA) NPs
were synthesized using a reverse micelle polymerization technique
by modifying the previously described method.15 Briefly, 1.6 g of dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) and 3.47 mL of Brij-30
were added to 45 mL of argon-purged hexane and continued to be stirred
and argon-purged for 20 min in a round-bottom flask. AAm, APMA hydrochloride,
and 3-(acryloyloxy)-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylate (AHM) were dissolved
in 1.3 mL of water in the mol ratio reported in Table 1 and in the amount calculated using eq 2, and all mixtures were
added to the flask and stirred and purged for additional 20 min. The
polymerization was initiated by adding 100 μL of 10(w/v)% ammonium
persulfate (APS) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine
(TEMED). After 2 h, the polymerization was terminated by introducing
atmospheric oxygen. Hexane was removed by rotary evaporation. The
remaining products were washed five times with 150 mL of ethanol and
five times with 150 mL of water in an Amicon stirred cell (Millipore)
using a 300 kDa MW cutoff membrane. The obtained solution was filtered
through a 0.2 μm pore size filter and lyophilized for 72 h for
long-term storage.

Preparation of
Blank Poly(AAm-co-AA) NPs
p(AAm-co-AA) NPs were synthesized similar to that of the p(AAm-co-APMA) NPs but with slight modifications. AOT (4.8 g)
and 9.5 mL of Brij-30 were added to 120 mL of argon-purged hexane
and continued to be stirred and purged with argon for 40 min. A mixture
of AAm, AA, and AHM, which was dissolved in 1 mL of DI water and 0.77
mL of DMF, was added to the flask in the mol ratio reported in Table 1 and in the amount
calculated using eq 2, argon-purged for additional 20 min, and then, the polymerization
was initiated by adding 100 μL of 50 (w/v)% APS and TEMED. After
4 h, the polymerization was terminated by introducing atmospheric
oxygen. Hexane was removed by rotary evaporation. The remaining products
were washed seven times with 150 mL of ethanol and five times with
150 mL of water in an Amicon stirred cell (Millipore) using a 300
kDa MW cutoff membrane. The obtained solution was filtered through
a 0.2 μm pore size filter and lyophilized for 72 h for long-term
storage.

Loading of Cisplatin into
Blank NPs
NPs (10 mg) were mixed with 2 mg of cisplatin dissolved
in 1 mL of water. For the loading of cisplatin to p(AAm-co-AA) NPs, 25 mM NaOH was also added to enhance the reaction between
the carboxyl group in the NPs and cisplatin. In case of room-temperature
loading, the mixture was kept for 3 days at room temperature. Then,
unbound cisplatin was removed by washing the NPs seven times with
7 mL of water using a 100 kDa MW cutoff centrifugal membrane (Millipore).
In case of high-temperature loading, the mixture was kept in a 90
°C oil bath for 4 h. Then, unbound cisplatin was removed, using
the same procedure as for the NP preparation in the case of the room-temperature
loading. The amounts of cisplatin loaded onto the NPs were quantified
using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

Degradation Study of NPs at a Higher
Temperature
The NPs were suspended in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) at a concentration of 10 mg mL–1, heated,
and kept at 90 °C for 4 h. After cooling down the solution to
room temperature, the NPs were diluted to 2 mg mL–1, and their sizes were measured using a Delsa Nano C analyzer (Beckman
Coulter).

Size and ζ-Potential
Measurement
Dynamic light scattering was applied to measure
the hydrodynamic size and the ζ-potential of NPs using a Delsa
Nano C analyzer. The size of the NPs was measured in PBS (pH 7.4)
and in complete RPMI, whereas the ζ-potential of the NPs was
measured in water.

Cisplatin Release
Study
The amount of cisplatin released from the NPs over
72 h was evaluated in PBS (pH 7.4). NP suspensions in PBS were prepared
in the way similar to that of the concentration of cisplatin (25 μg/mL).
Six Eppendorf tubes (1.5 mL) containing cisplatin-loaded NPs in PBS
were prepared. The tubes were kept at 37 °C until specific time
points were reached: 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. At each of the specific
time points, the solution in the tube was filtered using a 100 kDa
MW cutoff centrifugal membrane, and the filtrate was collected. The
other tube was used to measure the total cisplatin concentration in
the tube. The cisplatin concentrations in the filtrates were quantified
using ICP-OES.

Cellular Cisplatin
Uptake Assay
The human ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3, was
cultivated in RPMI with supplementation of 1% of penicillin, streptomycin,
and glutamine and 10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS).
SKOV3 cells were cultivated in a 100 × 20 mm Petri dish to over
80% confluency. Cisplatin-loaded NPs (700 μL) were prepared
in PBS with a cisplatin concentration of 25 μg/mL and mixed
with cells in a Petri dish containing 5 mL of complete RPMI. The cells
were incubated with NPs for 12 h and harvested after that. The populations
on the Petri dishes were counted, and the cells were lysed with nitric
acid. The Pt content in the lysate was measured using ICP-OES. On
the basis of the cell population and Pt content in the cell lysate,
the Pt content per cell was calculated.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed
using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and GraphPad Prism
7.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
