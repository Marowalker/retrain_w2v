Antimicrobial use in livestock has
emerged as a pressing global
issue because of the rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Regulatory
authorities across the globe have taken steps to discourage the misuse
of these antibiotics by banning or limiting the use of medically important
antibiotics in food animals. However, to ensure that food animals
are not being administered antibiotics inappropriately, there is a
need for a reliable, raid-response biosensor that can detect the presence
of these antibiotic residuals in meat products. We have developed
an affinity-based electrochemical biosensor for the label-free detection
of ceftiofur residues in meat samples. The sensor uses a self-assembled
immunoassay to target the ceftiofur biomarker by employing electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy to probe the interfacial capacitive changes
as ceftiofur binds to the sensor surface. We have demonstrated a platform
that can detect ceftiofur within 15 min of introducing the sample
at concentrations down to 0.01 ng/mL in 1× phosphate-buffered
saline and 10 ng/mL in 220 mg ground turkey meat samples.

Introduction
Antimicrobials have played an essential
role in the maintenance
and care for livestock since the mid-twentieth century.1,2 Today, antimicrobials are used in animal husbandry for a range of
applications from therapeutic use to promoting feed efficiency. When
administered at appropriate levels, these drugs exhibit bactericidal
or antimicrobial effects by inhibiting the activity or growth of bacteria.
However, when given in incorrect doses, bacterial drug resistance
may arise through either selection through random genetic mutation
or by horizontal plasmid exchange across an individual bacterium.2,3 Evidence suggests that misusing antimicrobials has contributed to
the rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARBs).4 Concern regarding the rise of ARBs has triggered an international
response; the World Health Organization has made tackling ARBs a priority
on their public health agenda and has released guidelines on the use
of medically important antimicrobials in the food production industry.2

The repeated, widespread use of antimicrobial
growth promoters
(AGPs) in poultry, swine, and beef cattle has been linked to the rise
in local antimicrobial-resistant bacterial populations.3,5 General dosing in the animal’s food leads to only partial
metabolism of the antimicrobials and is passed into the manure.1 The manure then harbors an environment for ARB
proliferation and subsequent spread via run-off or percolation into
rivers or water supplies.2,3

Growing demand
for animal protein in the developing world has led
to farming facilities to vertically integrate their livestock production—where
many animals are raised in close proximity and in poor sanitary conditions.6 Animals in these confined spaces are at high
risk of catching and spreading illnesses, and so, antimicrobials are
often used to curb the spread of disease. Multidrug-resistant ARBs
have emerged in these developing countries, posing a potential worldwide
risk to human health.7,8 ARBs have been found not only
in the treated animals, but also in their manure, local river water
and crops, as well as the gut flora of farm employees and family members.1,9

Human health can be affected by antibiotics directly through
residuals
found in meat or indirectly through the selection of antibiotic-resistant
strains of bacteria.5,10 Gassner and Wuethrich (1994)
demonstrated that residuals of chloramphenicol (a drug developed to
treat typhoid) metabolites in meat products were linked to aplastic
anemia in humans.11 Perhaps more significantly,
it was also believed that the overuse of chloramphenicol in animal
feed may have led to drug resistance of the Salmonella
typhi, the bacterium responsible for typhoid.11

Selection of resistant strains may occur
in pathogens that can
directly infect humans. Resistance may also be selected in bacteria
that reside in animals which may be easily transmitted to humans (e.g.,
rabies, lymes disease, or salmonella). Consequences of infection from
antibiotic-resistant bacteria range from prolonged illness to death
depending on severity of the infection and treatment success rate.12 Modern medicine has provided numerous antibiotic
variants, but some bacterial strains such as the multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA) are not easily treatable
by any antibiotic developed since the 1940s.13

These multidrug resistant bacteria have called for tighter
regulations
in the animal husbandry industry across the globe. The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, the European Union, and other regulatory bodies
have taken strides to ensure the judicious use of medically important
antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals.14 These efforts are defined as maximizing therapeutic efficiency
and minimizing selection of resistant microorganisms. China, which
produces over half of the world’s pork, is among a short list
of countries that places no restrictions on AGP use.8,15 This high-volume use of antibiotics in these developing countries
is believed to be one of the largest contributors to the increased
environmental burden of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs)s.8,15

Among the many different classes of antibiotics, ceftiofur
is a
third-generation cephalosporin labeled for veterinary use.12,15,16 Ceftiofur is often used to treat
respiratory disease in swine, cattle, sheep, and goats as well as
early mortality infections in chickens and turkeys.17 Ceftriaxone—another third-generation cephalosporin—is
critically important to human medicine as it is commonly used to treat
bacterial infections in children. All cephalosporins share the same
mechanism of action,17 thus, resistance
of bacteria toward these antibiotics is a major concern among medical
and veterinary experts.14 Studies have
supported the notion that the use of ceftiofur in animal food products
is a potential source of ceftriaxone-resistant salmonella infections
in humans.16,18,19

As more countries are pressured to adopt regulations limiting
the
use of antibiotics, the regulatory burden has grown when ensuring
the judicious use of antibiotics. A low-cost, reliable, and easy-to-use
biosensor that can detect antibiotics in animal food products would
not only reduce this regulatory burden but could also appeal to consumers
who wish to verify that their food is antibiotic-free.

The current
state-of-the-art antibiotic detection is achieved through
the principle of microbial inhibition. The Charm KIS test, for example,
utilizes bacteria in agar with a pH-indicator media.20 When activated, the bacteria generate acid and the pH indicator
changes colors. In the presence of an antibiotic, the bacterial growth
is inhibited, and the test does not change colors. Although relatively
easy to use, these tests are time consuming and do not provide quantitative
results for regulatory enforcement purposes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have
shown promise as potential analytical methods for identifying antibiotic
residues in food. These tools have demonstrated isolation and identification
of various antibiotics in animal tissue samples. However, large-scale
and low-cost implementation of these systems remains a problem to
be solved. ELISA often demonstrates good sensitivity and specificity,
but it requires a relatively large volume of sample and must be run
on a benchtop plate-reader by a trained scientist to interpret the
results. HPLC analysis is relatively quick to perform, but uses large
quantities of expensive organics and is difficult to implement on
a handheld device.

Although some screening methods for detecting
antibiotic residues
exist,21 these tests are either based on
microbial growth inhibition rather than detection of the analyte itself
or chromatographic methods, which are expensive and time-consuming.
Efforts to incorporate nanomaterials in antibiotic biosensors have
been emerging in the literature,22 however,
many of these biosensors either require labeling of the targeted antibiotic
or have not demonstrated the ability to detect antibiotics in meat
samples. Here, we have developed a novel affinity-based electrochemical
biosensor that can rapidly detect ceftiofur residues directly in meat
samples without the need for labeling of the target antibiotic.

Affinity-based immunosensors offer an attractive solution for scientists
within the animal husbandry industry, as well as regulatory bodies
and consumers for the detection of antibiotics in animal meat products.
Affinity-based immunosensors leverage biomarker detection through
a recognition element that specifically targets the biomarker of interest.
The chemical reaction between the target biomarker and the recognition
element is then transduced to a measure signal output related to the
concentration of the targeted biomarker. Immunosensors, particularly
electrochemical immunosensors, are an attractive solution for single-use
biosensing because of their high sensitivity, selectivity, and scalable
manufacturability.23,24

We have previously demonstrated
many affinity-based biosensors
using nonfaradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to
detect a range of biomarkers for various agricultural and human health
and wellness applications.23,24 Here, we present an
affinity-based biosensor that utilizes nonfaradaic EIS to detect the
presence of antibiotics in turkey meat samples. A highly specific
immunoassay is constructed on the sensor surface to encode specificity
toward ceftiofur—the antibiotic of interest.

Results and Discussion
Fourier-Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy Surface Characterization
Chemisorption
of the dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) crosslinker
and anti-ceftiofur antibody on the gold electrode surface was validated
using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Gold thin films
were deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates using
e-beam vapor deposition at parameters mimicking those used for sensor
fabrication and FTIR analysis. Functionalization of the electrode
surface was carried out as described in the previous section. Before
FTIR measurements, each sample was rinsed thoroughly with distilled
(DI) water, and then dried with N2 air to rid the surface
of any unbound material that may interfere with the analysis. The
infrared spectra of surface-modified samples were recorded with a
Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer.

Absorbance spectral measurements
were obtained with a scan resolution of 4 cm–1 for
64 scans in the spectral range of 4000–600 cm–1. Absorption spectra were recorded for PET–gold surface conjugated
to DSP molecules, and the gold surface with anti-ceftiofur antibodies
linked via the DSP linker molecules. The absorbance peaks observed
in the DSP spectrum of Figure 1 at 1799 and 1724 cm–1 indicate the symmetric
and asymmetric carbonyl stretches, respectively, of the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester. Furthermore, the peak at 1251 cm–1 confirms the presence of the asymmetric C–N–C
stretch of the NHS ester, whereas the peak at 1112 cm–1 can be identified as the succinimide N–C–O stretch.
Finally, the peak at 1822 cm–1 indicates the ester
carbonyl stretch. The presence of these peaks is characteristic of
a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of DSP, confirming the chemisorption
of DSP to the gold surface.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra validating the (a) DSP crosslinker
immobilization
onto bare Au surface and (b) bound anti-ceftiofur antibody conjugated
to DSP crosslinker.

The reaction between
the NHS group with the antibody’s primary
amine group can be noted in the anti-ceftiofur spectrum. The C–O
bonds of the NHS ester are broken and react with primary amines of
the antibody, resulting in a stable amide bond. Suppression of peaks
associated with the NHS ester (1799, 1724, and 1251 cm–1) is observed, whereas peaks at ∼1644 and ∼1552 cm–1 are indicative of amide I and amide II peaks. These
results show a stable formation of the immunoassay through the binding
of the anti-ceftiofur antibodies to the DSP-functionalized surface.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
The electrochemical
response was evaluated at each step of the immunoassay through EIS
measurements. The bulk and interfacial phenomena were visualized using
Nyquist impedance plots (Figure 2a), and values of the impedance modulus (Z*) were extracted at 10 Hz to highlight the impedance changes as
the immunoassay was chemisorbed onto the sensor surface as seen in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) Nyquist impedance
plot, (b) Bode phase plot, and (c) extracted Z* values
at 10 Hz for EIS measurements to validate the
chemisorption of the DSP crosslinker and subsequent anti-ceftiofur
antibody.

A 1× phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) measurement was performed
before any surface modifications to evaluate the baseline electrical
double layer (EDL) properties at the electrode–electrolyte
interface. In the absence of any surface modifications, the 1×
PBS measurement exhibits a compressed semicircle in the Nyquist impedance
plot, indicating a resistance-dominated system where hydrolysis and/or
gold oxidation is occurring as charges leak across the electrode–electrolyte
interface because of the applied dc bias. After subsequent binding
of the DSP linker, a second 1× PBS measurement was taken to examine
how the DSP monolayer impacts interfacial properties. When the DSP
linker self-assembles, an insulative layer forms at the interface,
both reducing the propensity for charge transfer across this interface
and increasing the charge separation between the solvent ions and
the electrode surface.

When extracting the impedance at 10 Hz
(Figure 2c), the Z* drops from 113 528
to 86 295 Ω after binding DSP to the gold electrode surface.
The impedance drop is driven by changes in both the real and imaginary
impedance response. The decrease in charge transfer across the interface
is observed as a large reduction in the real impedance (Z′), a small increase in imaginary impedance (Z″), and an increase in the semi-circle diameter of Figure 2a. Binding of the
DSP molecules also creates a separation of charges and leads to a
reduction in the EDL capacitance (hence, the increase in Z″), shifting the low frequency phase response toward −90°
as seen in the Bode phase diagram in Figure 2b.

After DSP modified the surface,
the addition of the antibody introduces
excess charges at the electrode interface, resulting in a small increase
in Z′ as well as the phase. This increase
is reflected in the overall impedance as the Z* value
at the antibody step was 97 208 Ω. A third 1× PBS
measurement (0-dose) was taken to validate that the antibodies remain
bound to the electrode surface. Although there was a slight increase
in the Z* value (to 102 537 Ω), there
was no significant change observed between the antibody and the subsequent
PBS, indicating that the NHS esters on the DSP molecule have reacted
with the primary amines on the anti-ceftiofur antibody, anchoring
them to the electrode surface.

Calibrated Dose Response
in 1× PBS
The third 1×
PBS measurement after the antibody also serves as a “blank”
for subsequent ceftiofur dose steps. Doses of ceftiofur were prepared
in 1× PBS from 0.1 to 10 ng/mL, and the resulting Nyquist capacitance
plots are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Calibrated dose response across varying concentrations of ceftiofur
administered onto the sensor represented as (a) Nyquist capacitance
plot, (b) percent change in impedance with respect to the antibody
measurement at 10 Hz with SST in dark blue (n = 4),
and (c) percentage change in impedance comparison with respect to
the blank dose (1× PBS) at 10 Hz for nonspecific BSA (green)
and specific ceftiofur (blue) for n = 3.

The measured concentration range was selected as
it spans the typical
concentrations measured in commercially available ceftiofur ELISA
kits. As ceftiofur molecules bind to the immunoassay, the dielectric
permittivity of the EDL is modulated.

Changes in impedance spectra
because of biomarker binding are not
always resolvable depending on the nature of the support matrix and
the biomarker of interest. To address the poor resolution between
ceftiofur concentrations, the impedance data is transformed into a
complex capacitance, which highlights the storage characteristics
occurring at the interface rather than resistive terms which are emphasized
in EIS. A complex capacitance plot is shown in Figure 3a with the imaginary capacitance (C″) on the y-axis and the real capacitance
(C′) on the x-axis. Here,
a semicircle is observed for every dose of ceftiofur with a diameter
of ∼7.5 × 10–6 S, corresponding to the
primary relaxation constant of the immunoassay.

A second, concentration-dependent
semicircle manifests at lower
frequencies with higher doses of the ceftiofur biomarker. This second
semicircle appears due to a second relaxation process in response
to the applied potential. The polar structure of the ceftiofur molecule
likely introduces additional degrees of freedom when binding to the
adsorbed immunoassay. However, further investigation into the immunoassay
structure would need to be carried out before validating this claim.
The percent change in impedance at 10 Hz was the calculated change
for each concentration of ceftiofur with respect to the antibody measurement
and plotted versus ceftiofur concentration between 0.01 and 100 ng/mL
with the initial “0-dose” corresponding to a measurement
in 1× PBS without any ceftiofur antigens.

When the ceftiofur
molecule binds to the immunoassay, a second
dipolar relaxation process emerges, raising the capacitance, and thus,
decreasing the impedance response. For ceftiofur spiked in PBS, the
impedance response varies with a dynamic range between 75967 Ω
(0.01 ng/mL) and 67020 Ω (100 ng/mL), corresponding to a 26%
to a 34% change with respect to a blank solution. A signal-to-noise
ratio of 3 was selected to calculate the specific signal threshold
(SST) impedance as indicated in the following equation 1  

The limit of detection (LOD) is identified as the lowest concentration
of ceftiofur, which can be reliably and feasibly detected from a “blank”
solution.

The LOD can be calculated by using the mean and standard
deviation
for the 1× PBS measurement after binding the antibody 2  

The LOD was found by subtracting the SEM for each concentration
of the ceftiofur (SEM[ceftiofur]) from the mean μ[ceftiofur]. This value was then compared to the SST for each
concentration of ceftiofur, and the lowest concentration that exhibited
a value larger than the SST was determined as the LOD. Concentrations
at and above the LOD show significant impedance responses indicating
that ceftiofur is reliably detectable. Using eq 2, the LOD for ceftiofur was 0.01 ng/mL in
1× PBS. Although a lower LOD likely exists for ceftiofur in 1×
PBS, as seen in Figure 3b, the 1× PBS dose response is meant to validate that varying
doses will elicit a different electrochemical response, not to characterize
the entire dynamic range of the sensor. Thus, 0.01 ng/mL was chosen
as an acceptable lower LOD.

The ability of the biosensor to
respond to ceftiofur in the presence
of nonspecifics is defined as the specificity of the sensor. Robust
biosensing requires evaluation of the nonspecific responses obtained
on interaction with the ceftiofur antibody with non-specific antibiotics
and proteins. The specificity of the sensor is determined by using
BSA (bovine serum albumin) as the nonspecific protein. The binding
interaction between the anti-ceftiofur immobilized on the sensing
platform and increasing dose concentrations of BSA is shown as a calibration
dose response in Figure 3c. The percentage change in imaginary impedance with respect to the
blank dose (1× PBS) is calculated at 10 Hz. The percentage change
in imaginary impedance for the nonspecific protein, BSA, shows no
dose-dependent response for increasing concentrations of BSA and is
observed to be between 3.7 and 15% for BSA concentrations 0.01–10
ng/mL. However, the interaction between ceftiofur with its specific
antibody shows an increasing dose response with increasing ceftiofur
concentrations. The percentage change in imaginary impedance for increasing
ceftiofur concentrations, 0.01–10 ng/mL, is observed to be
27–37%. The outcome of the specificity study is that nonspecific
proteins, such as BSA, show minimum crossresponse to the immobilized
ceftiofur antibody.

Calibrated Dose Response in Meat
Translating from 1×
PBS to the turkey meat enhanced the resolution of bulk capacitive
response as indicated by the Nyquist impedance plots shown in Figure 4a. This is likely
because the turkey samples exhibited a more resistive response, implying
a lower effective ionic content, thus enhancing the effect of interfacial
bulk capacitance. To remove the effects from bulk solution resistance
and focus on affinity binding at the interface, the imaginary impedance
(Z″) was isolated and analyzed at the low-frequency
spectrum to determine dose-dependent changes, as seen in Figure 4b.

Figure 4 Calibrated dose response
across varying concentrations of ceftiofur
absorbed in turkey meat samples administered directly onto the sensor
and represented as (a) Nyquist impedance plot and (b) Z″at 10 Hz (n = 3).

The turkey samples act as a porous solid retaining the electrolyte
within the meat. The addition of these porous boundaries interferes
with the distance for the ions to travel in the bulk of the solution
and is seen as an increase in the high frequency solution resistance.
The low-frequency response of the sample is less impacted by the meat
sample, as it measures interfacial properties and does not probe into
the bulk of the solution. At the low frequency range, it is evident
that as larger concentrations of ceftiofur are added to the meat samples,
a decrease in Z″ is observed. This decrease
is caused again by the binding of electrically charged ceftiofur molecules
modulating the dielectric permittivity within the EDL. The LOD was
again found for the ceftiofur doses in turkey meat. Here, SST was
found using eq 3. 3  

The SST was 159 050.3 Ω. The LOD was then calculated
using eq 2 for the doses
in turkey meat, making the 10 ng/mL dose the only sample reliably
distinguishable from the antibiotic-free meat. It can be concluded
that the sensor performance is effective at detecting ultra-low concentrations
of ceftiofur within meat samples, and the flexible sensor prototype
would greatly reduce the time and financial burden to test meat samples
for the presence of antibiotic residues.

Conclusions
Antibiotic
detecting in meat samples has tremendous importance
in the livestock and consumer marketplace. As new strains of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria continue to emerge, regulatory authorities, such as the FDA
and USDA, will continue to place more restrictions on the use of medically
important antibiotics in food animals. These restrictions place a
larger financial and time burden on livestock farmers to comply with
appropriate dosing of antibiotics and regulators to ensure compliance.
To prevent these operations from being too costly or time consuming,
a faster, cheaper method of antibiotic detection is needed.

This work proposes a low-cost, proof-of-concept biosensor for the
detection of antibiotic residuals. Based on our review of literature
in the public domain, this is the first impedimetric biosensor for
the detection of antibiotics in meat samples. The biosensor demonstrates
high sensitivity (LOD = 0.01 ng/mL) in a physiological buffer, without
the use of any external labels or redox reagents. Monitoring both
changes in EDL capacitance (through Nyquist impedance plots) and SAM
dielectric capacitance (through Nyquist capacitance plots) allows
for the detection medium to be readily swapped for other more complex
samples, such as turkey meat. In the turkey meat samples, the sensor
demonstrates a decreasing trend in the Z″
response at 10 Hz at concentrations of ceftiofur well below the current
standard detection thresholds. Additionally, the sensor was still
able to capture dose-dependent changes within the meat samples with
good sensitivity (LOD = 10 ng/mL). The higher limit of detection was
due to the complex nature of the meat sample matrix. The porous nature
of the meat interferes with the nonfaradaic current conduction, and
physical contact of the meat sample onto the sensor surface may also
impede access to the self-assembled immunoassay. However, this is—to
our knowledge—the first demonstration of a label-free, electrochemical
biosensor for the detection of any antibiotic material.

This
work demonstrates strong feasibility toward a rapid, versatile
antibiotic biosensor by characterizing the effect of a meat matrix
on the immunosensor. An easy to use biosensor that can detect the
presence antibiotic material directly in the meat samples would allow
regulatory authorities, livestock farmers, and everyday consumers
to better monitor the quality of their meat. Further refinement of
the sensor architecture should be explored to validate antibiotic
detection in contaminated meats, by exploring methods to first increase
sensitivity on spiked meat matrices. Additionally, as antibodies can
be produced for nearly any target antigen, it is feasible that this
platform can be modulated to detect other antibiotics by replacing
the anti-ceftiofur antibody within the immunoassay. Additionally,
the sensor could be tested across a variety of meat samples. To increase
the resolution for detection within meat samples, other surface modifications
may be necessary to create a physical barrier between the meat sample
and the immunoassay constructed on the sensor surface (e.g., hydrogel
deposition or another physical polymer barrier). The barrier would
prevent physical interaction between the meat sample and the immunoassay,
likely leading to better stability and sensitivity. However, this
work has demonstrated reproducible detection of antibiotic residues
within meat samples, making this sensor platform as the first demonstration
of in-meat electrochemical antibiotic biosensing.

Experimental
Section
Sensor Fabrication Process
The biosensor was fabricated
on PET substrates using the e-beam deposition technique. Electrodes
were deposited using electron beam physical vapor deposition at a
pressure of 5 × 10–6 Torr. The electrode patterns
were deposited with 125 nm Au onto the precleaned PET substrate. A
polydimethyl siloxane confinement well was prepared to restrict the
sample fluid in a controlled volume around the site of the three electrodes.
To prepare the sensors for electrochemical measurements, the surface
of the gold electrodes and the PET substrate were rinsed with 70%
isopropyl alcohol, and DI water to remove organic residues. The electrodes
were then dried with inert N2 gas to prepare the surface
for self-assembly of the immunoassay. Construction of the immunoassay
first chemisorbs a linker molecule to the electrode surface, and then
binds a capture antibody for subsequent detection of a dynamic range
of the ceftiofur antigen.

The linker molecule specific to our
biosensor is the amine-reactive crosslinker DSP. DSP has a NHS ester
that is highly reactive with the primary amines which are abundant
in antibodies and a cleavable disulfide bond in the molecule’s
spacer arm that interacts with the electrode surface via gold–thiol
interaction. DSP forms highly ordered SAMs,25,26 which immobilize the anti-ceftiofur (α-ceftiofur) capture
antibody. A 150 μL sample of 10 mM DSP was incubated on the
bare sensor surface for 60 min. After DSP immobilization, a sample
of 150 μL of 10 μg/mL α-ceftiofur antibody were
incubated on the sensor surface for 90 min to ensure reaction with
the DSP molecules. High-affinity of the ceftiofur antigen toward the
α-ceftiofur antibody allows for rapid binding interactions.
Specificity studies involved the interaction of increasing dose concentrations
of 0.01–10 ng/mL BSA prepared in 1× PBS with the α-ceftiofur
antibody.

Turkey Meat Matrix Preparation
Turkey meat samples
were prepared from USDA-verified antibiotic free source to ensure
that no ceftiofur residuals would be already present in the samples.
The meat samples (220 mg) were first submerged in 300 μL of
1× PBS (control), a 0.1 ng/mL ceftiofur dose, or a 10 ng/mL ceftiofur
dose for 15 min to ensure uptake of the ceftiofur antigen. The samples
were then placed on the sensor and tested for affinity binding of
the ceftiofur biomarker to the immunoassay. Further refinement of
the incubation time may be necessary to ensure that the ceftiofur
molecules are absorbed within the meat, however, we have demonstrated
through our electrochemical measurements that the ceftiofur molecule
was present in the meat sample upon testing.

Electrochemical Evaluation
Electrochemical experiments
were performed using a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat. Nonfaradaic
EIS was used as a label-free approach to quantify impedance changes
in the electric double-layer capacitance. An input 10 mV sinusoidal
voltage with a dc bias of −0.3 V versus ref was applied at
the working electrode, and then scanned across a frequency range of
1 Hz to 1 MHz (input parameters optimized previously).27 The resultant current response was measured,
and the complex impedance was calculated as the ratio of the input
voltage to the output current. Ceftiofur doses were diluted in 1×
Dulbecco’s PBS (1× PBS) to obtain concentrations of 0.01–10
ng/mL for either sample. A “blank” sample (absent of
the ceftiofur antigen) was tested after functionalization with the
antibody to serve as a baseline measurement before administering subsequent
doses.

After validating the electrochemical response to ceftiofur
in a relatively low noise physiological buffer, the biosensor was
then tested using turkey meat samples to characterize the feasibility
as an antibiotic sensor for animal food products.
