The normal modes of ice IX were investigated
using the CASTEP code
package, which is based on density functional theory. We found that
the translational modes could be divided into three categories: four-bond
vibrations, which possessed the highest energy; two-bond vibrations,
which possessed the medium energy; and cluster vibrations with the
lowest energy. The former two categories represent monomers vibrating
against neighbors and present as two distinct peaks in many ice phases
recorded in inelastic neutron-scattering experiments. It is typically
difficult to assign the molecular vibration peaks in the far infrared
region. The method we developed to analyze the normal modes, especially
in the translation band of ice IX, provided physical insights into
the vibrational spectrum of ice.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Water
is one of the most important materials in the human body
and the most valuable resource on Earth.1 The solid state of water, ice, has been experimentally confirmed
to exist in more than 17 crystalline and amorphous phases, depending
on pressure and temperature.2−11 These phases can be divided into two main categories according to
whether their structure is hydrogen long-range disordered or ordered.
At present, there are six known disordered/ordered pair phases of
ice: Ih/XI, III/IX, V/XIII, VI/XV, VII/VIII, and XII/XIV.12 This work focused on interpreting the vibrational
spectra of ice IX.

Ice III has a hydrogen-disordered structure
and exists at 24–44
°C and 2.4–3.4 kbar. Whalley et al. found that, at 65–108
°C, ice III can gradually transform into a new hydrogen-ordered
phase that is designated ice IX.8 Many
infrared (IR) absorption,13 Raman scattering,14 and neutron scattering15 experiments have been conducted to characterize ice III and ice
IX. Garg and other groups of researchers found by Raman analysis that
pressurizing ice Ih at 150 K transformed it into ice IX.16−19

We performed a series of studies20−27 of the vibrational spectra of ice by developing a method to analyze
its lattice vibrations. We constructed a dual-track approach to verify
the validity for the computational phonon spectrum: collate the simulated
spectrum with inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments and assign
the photon absorption/scattering peaks according to the calculated
normal vibration frequencies.28 The two
distinct peaks in the translational band were found to correspond
to two molecular vibration modes. In this study, we continued to investigate
ice IX and confirmed this finding. In addition, we analyzed the optic
phonons in the far IR region and provided physical insights into molecular
vibrations in the translational band of ice IX.

2 Results
and Discussion
The computed spectra of Raman scattering,
IR absorption, and phonon
density of states (PDOS) are shown in Figure 1, which are divided into four parts according
to the four separate vibrational regions. Due to the wide range of
the intensity in different regions, we adjusted their proportions
for comparison. As the interactions between photons and phonons are
restricted near the Brillouin zone (BZ) center, the peaks of Raman
and IR spectra were close to the frequencies of normal modes. The
spectrum of INS was proportional to the calculated PDOS curve because
INS could collect all the phonon signals throughout the first BZ.20 Comparisons between PDOS and INS and between
the normal modes and Raman/IR peaks are shown in Table 1. Because of the hydrogen-disordered
nature of ice III, their vibrational spectrum does not show sharp
features as ice IX. We supplemented the discussions in the corresponding
context.

a The main peaks of PDOS in the first
column are compared against the INS spectrum. Normal modes (where
the number in brackets indicates the number of degenerate modes) are
compared against experimental Raman and IR Peaks. All units are cm–1.

A primitive
cell contained 12 molecules. Thus, there were 12 ×
3 × 3 – 3 = 105 optic normal modes, and 33 of them were
in the translation band at 66–307 cm–1. From Figure 1, we can see that
the PDOS curve had three main bands at approximately 100, 200, and
300 cm–1. A comparison of the obtained INS measurements
with those reported by Li shows that the set exactly fitted the experimental
curve.29 A detailed comparison of peaks
is given in Table 1.

It is typically difficult to assign the peaks of a vibrational
spectrum in the fingerprint region. To clarify the physical features
of these spectra, we needed to review our previous study of the simplest
phase of the ice family, the hydrogen-ordered structure of ice Ic.
We found two kinds of intrinsic translational modes in this lattice.21 In the strong mode, the molecule vibrates against
with four connecting H-bonds, which is denoted the four-bond mode.
In the weak mode, two perpendicular degenerate modes involve only
two oscillating H bonds, and these are denoted the two-bond mode.
By treating the two H-bonded molecules as a spring, a simple harmonic
oscillator model yielded a strength ratio of . Later,
we also observed this phenomenon
in ices XIV, XVI, XVII, VII, and VIII22−25 and concluded that the two distinct
peaks of ice in the translation band are from two types of vibrational
modes. In this work, we not only confirmed this rule but also determined
the origin of the third lower peak.

As shown in Figure 2, the normal mode at 307 cm–1 was a typical four-bond
mode, in which all the molecules in one primitive cell vibrated along
its HOH angular bisector. This was the highest frequency found for
the translational modes, and there were nine such strong modes from
265 to 307 cm–1, as listed in Table 1.

Figure 2 Top view of nine examples of normal modes. Green
arrows represent
the vibrational directions of the atoms and the size proportional
to the amplitude.

The mode at 245 cm–1 was an example of two-bond
modes that possessed a medium energy of 119–245 cm–1. These two kinds of modes corresponded to vibrations of monomer
and thus were independent of movements. The dynamic vibration of the
mode at 116 cm–1 (see Supporting Information) was very similar to that of the strong mode in
which all molecules vibrated along their bisector. However, this was
a collective vibration in which three molecules combined to form a
cluster. The inner H bonds did not stretch, so the vibrational frequency
was much lower than that of the four-bond mode. Based on the analysis
above, we plotted the distributions of the above three categories
to mimic the PDOS curve, as shown in Figure 3. Compared with the insertion of PDOS, one
can see a minor discrepancy due to phonon dispersion throughout the
BZ as explained in our previous work.28

Figure 3 Fitted
curves of the distributions of four-bond modes (blue), two-bond
modes (red), and cluster modes (green) of ice IX in the translation
band. The PDOS curve is depicted in the inset for comparison.

There were 36 normal modes in the intermolecular
libration band
at 580–1003 cm–1, and the bandwidth was 423
cm–1, which was in good agreement with the bandwidth
at 440 cm–1 described in Li’s report.18

There were three types of vibration modes:
rocking or rotation
of the whole molecule around an axis perpendicular to the molecular
plane; twisting or rotation of the molecule around an axis coincident
with the HOH angle bisector; and wagging or rotation of the molecule
around an axis in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the bisector
of the HOH angle. In an optic mode, the mass center of a primitive
cell remains static, while the molecules within it may vibrate differently.
Two typical modes are illustrated in Figure 2.

All the molecules displayed rocking
vibrations at 580 cm–1 and twisting at 1003 cm–1. As all the molecules
vibrated in wagging mode at 771 cm–1, we cannot
display them all in Figure 2. This normal mode analysis clearly demonstrated that the
order of strength was rocking, wagging, and finally twisting.

Three sharp peaks were observed in the libration region of the
INS spectrum by Li et al. at 88.9 (711 cm–1), 116
(928 cm–1), and 90 meV (720 cm–1).18 These peaks were observed in the
PDOS spectrum at 702, 720, and 916 cm–1, respectively.
However, the Raman/IR data of ice IX were missing in the libration
band. For ice III, four IR peaks were detected in this region by Bertie
et al. at 600, 660, 734, and 925 cm–1.30 These peaks can match well with normal modes
at 593, 662, 737, and 934 cm–1, respectively.

In the bending band, there were 12 normal modes at 1639–1716
cm–1. All the monomer vibrations were the same.
However, the collective vibrations could be classified as in-phase
or out-of-phase vibration modes. The mode at 1639 cm–1 with the lowest energy in this band had an out-of-phase mode, while
the strongest mode at 1716 cm–1 had an in-phase
vibration. On the contrary, an increasing energy trend from in-phase
bending to out-of-phase bending was observed in ice XIV.22 Li et al. found a peak at 210 meV (1680 cm–1) in the INS spectrum,18 which matched well with the PDOS curve. Although the simulated Raman
and IR spectra both contained some peaks in this band, their intensities
were too weak to permit proper detection. We also found an IR medium
peak of ice III at 1690 cm–1,30 which can be observed in normal modes at 1702 cm–1.

There were 24 normal vibration modes in the stretching band
at
3177–3391 cm–1. In this region, the O–H
covalent bonds of each molecule showed symmetric stretching or asymmetric
stretching. Two examples are illustrated in Figure 2 to show that the energy increasing trend
was from symmetric stretching to asymmetric stretching, consistent
with trends in other ice phases. We also found many modes in this
band with one O–H bond exhibiting “isolated stretching”,
while the other remained static, as was reported by Whale et al.31 This is very common in high-pressure ices in
our previous studies of ice XIV, XVI, XVII, and VII. We attributed
this phenomenon as the reduction of symmetry of the local tetrahedral
structure under pressure.

Bertie et al. reported four peaks
in the Raman spectrum at 3151.4,
3274.2, 3360, and 3440 cm–1.17 These peaks matched well with our simulated results at
3177, 3285, 3362, and 3391 cm–1, respectively. In
addition, we noticed that Moberg et al. used two methods to calculate
the Raman spectra, which are many-body molecular dynamics (MB-MD)
and normal mode (NM).12 According to their
work, two main Raman peaks were calculated at 3154 and 3243 cm–1. Furthermore, our results were at 3177 and 3285 cm–1. Compared with the experimental Raman spectrum, we
found that the weak peak calculated by MB-MD matched well with the
experimental data. In contrast, our work of the second peak at 3285
cm–1 was better. Our experiences indicated that
the lattice dynamics simulation based on harmonic approximation is
good enough to present the vibrational spectrum of ices. The INS spectrum
had a peak at 418 meV (3344 cm–1),18 which corresponded to our results at 3355 (PDOS)/3359 cm–1 (normal modes). Four IR sharp peaks of ice III observed
at 3160, 3250, 3290, and 3350 cm–1 can be well matched
with normal modes at 3194, 3276, 3285, and 3362 cm–1, respectively. The Raman spectrum of ice III presented two peaks
at 3159 and 3281 cm–1 reported by Taylor et al.,32 which have their corresponding simulated results
in normal modes at 3177 and 3285 cm–1, respectively.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the vibrational
spectrum of ice IX
using a DFT-based method. We analyzed the normal modes in this model,
especially in the translational band. We divided the translational
modes into three categories: four-bond vibrations, which possessed
the highest energy; two-bond vibrations, which possessed the medium
energy; and cluster vibrations, which had the lowest energy. This
may be a general rule among ice phases.

In ice XV, VII, and
VIII, the cluster modes were relative vibrations
between two sublattices. The four-bond and two-bond modes constituted
the two distinct peaks seen in many ices, while the cluster modes
often had a hump in lower bands or merged with acoustic phonons.

The normal modes of ice IX displayed significant regularities.
In the libration band, the energy-increasing trend was from rocking
to wagging to twisting; in the bending band, this trend was from out-of-phase
bending to in-phase bending; and in the stretching band, it was from
symmetric stretching to asymmetric stretching. Thus, ice IX was confirmed
to have a typical phase that could represent the nature of ice in
terms of molecular and atomic vibrations.

4 Computational
Method
Using CASTEP,33 a package
of first-principles
density functional theory (DFT), we performed geometrical optimization
and phonon calculation of ice IX with the method of linear response.
The linear response was used to calculate the PDOS, which is one of
the most popular methods to provide an analytical way of computing
the harmonic approximation results.34 As
the electron density has a large distribution, we chose generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) for the ice crystal. However, predictions
made by different exchange–correlation (XC) functionals can
have large disagreement and may not be accurate enough as mentioned
by Gillan et al.35 To test the (XC) functional,
we tried RPBE, PBE, PBE + D, PW91, PW91 + D, WC, and PBESOL for geometric
optimization of ice IX. The results showed that the densities are
1.01, 1.15, 1.28, 1.18, 1.58, 1.24, and 1.28 g/cm3, respectively.
Although the densities from PBE and PW91 results are close to the
experiment (1.17 g/cm3), the consequent simulations of
the strongest translation modes are at 370 and 409 cm–1, quite bigger than the experimental data of 317 cm–1. Since the best matchable frequency was at 307 cm–1 of RPBE, we thus chose XC RPBE36 for
this work. The norm-conserving pseudopotential was used to calculate
the PDOS. The energy convergence and SCF tolerance were set at 1 ×
10–9 eV/atom. The energy cutoff was 750 eV, and
the k-point sampling was 2 × 2 × 2. The
hydrostatic pressure was set to 0.3 GPa.
