In
this paper, the coupled Ag-shell/dielectric-core nanorod for
sensor application is investigated and the different dielectric core
plasmonic metamaterial is adopted in our design. The operational principle
is based on the concept of combining the lattice resonance, localized
surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and cavity plasmon resonance modes
within the nanostructure. The underlying mechanisms are investigated
numerically by using the three-dimensional finite element method and
the numerical results of coupled solid Ag nanorods are included for
comparison. The characteristic absorptance/reflectance peaks/dips
have been demonstrated to be induced by different plasmonic modes
that could lead to different responses required for plasmonic sensors.
A nearly perfect absorptance and an approximate zero reflectance with
a sharp band linewidth are obtained from the proposed system, when
operated as an SPR sensor with the sensitivity and figure of merit
of 757.58 nm/RIU (RIU is the refractive index unit) and 50.51 (RIU–1), respectively. Our work provides a promising method
for the future developments of more advanced metamaterial absorber
for chemical sensing, thermal radiation tailoring, field enhanced
spectroscopy, and general filtering applications.

1 Introduction
Plasmonic perfect absorbers
(PPAs) have fascinated increasing attention
in the field of nanophotonic devices because of their unusual capacity
of absorbing and enhancing electromagnetic (EM) waves to the nanometer-scale.1 It can be applied to different fields, such as
resonators,2 refractive index (RI) sensors,3 nanoantennas,4 plasmonic
solar cells,5 biosensing,6−10 and absorbers.11,12 Narrow-band plasmonic absorbers
using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects are widely used in thermal
radiation manipulation,13,14 detection, and sensors.15−18 On the basis of plasmonic nanostructures (PNSs) with the properties
of gap plasmon resonance (GPR),19 cavity
plasmon resonance (CPR),20 and metal–dielectric–metal
structure,11,12 perfect plasmonic absorbers21,22 can be achieved in the visible, infrared regime, and other EM regimes.

Recently, researchers have made many advancing efforts on PPAs
to achieve narrow band absorption11 for
plasmonic sensing applications. The narrow spectrum bandwidth is required
in medical sensing applications, for example the monitoring of chemical
reactions,23 the measurement of gas concentrations,24 as well as the detection of biomolecules.25 However, the general PPAs exhibit complicated
structure, and the resonance wavelength is at a fixed wavelength,
and this limits the diversification of their deployment. The various
approaches which have been reported to narrow the band linewidth giving
sharp spectrum feature12,26,27 are plasmonic gap resonance,28 surface
lattice resonance,29 and magnetic dipole
resonance.30 There are several metastructures
which have been studied for the purpose of absorption and they are
based on gap resonance;31,32 however, these literature
studies did not report on the design of sensors having perfect absorptance
and zero reflectance properties. PPAs need to be designed with simple
structure and tunable in the infrared regime if they are to be successfully
implemented in sensor applications.

The large band linewidth
of plasmon resonances causes strong radiative
damping in metals, which is a major problem because it reduces the
sensitivity and hence lowering the quality factor (Q-factor) of the sensor. An effective way to overcome this drawback
is to couple the plasmonic effects to a system with a narrow resonance.
There are several methods to narrow band tunability of PPAs, for example,
the use of stacked graphene-dielectric sheet,31 applying phase-change material (Ge2Sb2Te5),32 and deploying microelectromechanical
system.33 For practical applications, a
large intensity variation of the absorbed or reflected light at a
certain wavelength is desired, that is, sharp peaks/dips of absorptance/reflectance
with a large modulation depth are required. In contrast to the above
mentioned techniques, we proposed a dual band and tunability PPA consisting
of coupled Ag-shell/dielectric-core (ASDC) nanorod array arranged
in a square lattice. In our design, the PPA is made tunable by physically
modifying the PPA’s material and geometry. Each resonance obtained
from our proposed PPA has excellent correlation with respect to geometrical
and material parameters, and furthermore, it shows excellent tunability
for each resonant wavelength (λres). In the proposed
structure, an open cavity is introduced in ASDC nanorods such that
it is accessible to the surrounding medium, and this makes the ASDC
nanorods an attractive RI sensor. The ASDC nanorods and the bottom
Ag thin film layer provide an optical response of SPR and CPR, and
the positive–negative charge pairs will induce an electromotive
force on the metal surface, thus causing an effective coupled mode
which supports a nearly perfect absorptance and an approximate zero
reflectance. ASDC nanorods that are placed at a Bragg distance above
a metal mirror (i.e., 100 nm Ag bottom layer) form a Fabry–Pérot
nanocavity, and they constitute a coupled photonic–plasmonic
system. The influences of structure and material parameters on the
sensing performance are investigated by using the three-dimensional
(3-D) finite element method (FEM). In addition, we put to use the
strong localized enhancement of the EM wave in the gap and cavity
regions in the ASDC nanorods, and we examine the RI infrared sensing
performance. It is found that the absorptance bandwidth can be changed
by varying the dielectric core in the Ag-shell nanorods, and a nearly
perfect absorptance together with an approximate zero reflectance
with a sharp band linewidth are obtained from the proposed system.
The proposed structure can be operated as SPR sensors where the sensitivity
and figure of merit (FOM) of 757.58 nm/RIU and 50.51 (RIU–1), respectively, are observed. This narrow band linewidth and perfect
absorptance properties are required in sensing and filtering applications.34

2 Simulation Method and Models
To analyze the proposed plasmonic system, 3-D FEM is performed
using a commercially available software package (COMSOL multiphysics).
Because of the symmetry of the structures, a plane wave polarized
in x-axis is used as the incident light at normal
incidence from the top surface. Periodic boundary conditions are considered
in x- and y-directions, and perfectly
matching layers are applied along the z direction.
The Ag permittivity data cited in ref (35) is used. The absorptance (A) is calculated as 1 – reflectance (R) –
transmittance (T), with transmittance being nearly
zero in the infrared realm (i.e., the working region of the proposed
PPA) because of the thickness of the bottom Ag film is thicker than
the skin depth in the infrared region, the transmittance (T) channel is prevented, and the absorptance is reduced
to 1 – R. The sensing capability of the SPR
sensor is usually defined by the following definitions of sensitivity
(S) and FOM.3,4 1  where Δλ is the corresponding
central wavelength shift of the resonant dips and Δn is the difference of the RI. fwhm is the full width at half maximum
of the SPR spectrum, and it is defined as the corresponding λres width at half percentage of the reflectance dip. The Q factor can be calculated as the ratio of peak resonance
wavelength (λres) and the full width at half maximum,
that is, Q = λres/fwhm.36

The coupled ASDC nanorod array is arranged
in a square lattice. Figure 1 depicts a truncated
view of the periodic arrays of the coupled ASDC nanorods. The proposed
structure consists of periodic arrays of coupled ASDC nanorods placed
directly on the surface of a uniform Ag film. The value of the incident
EM wave is fixed at |E0|
= 1 V/m. The closely spaced ASDC nanorods have an outer radius (R) and inner radius (r) of 80 and 70 nm,
thickness (t = R – r) of 10 nm, and gap distance (g) of 20
nm. The filling medium in ASDC is set to air (ε = 1.00) and
silica (SiO2). The lattice constant (a) of the arrays is 470 nm, and the bottom silver film has a thickness
(s) of 100 nm. In addition, the whole structure is
placed on a silica substrate (i.e., glass), and the surrounding material
is assumed to be air or n, where n is the RI of the surrounding medium. The RI of silica is calculated
through the Sellmeier equation.37 All materials
are assumed to be nonmagnetic (i.e., μ = μ0).

Figure 1 Truncated view of the periodic arrays of coupled ASDC nanorods
placed directly on the surface of a uniform Ag film. The unit cell
repeats in the x and y direction
forming a square array with periodicity a. The origin
[(x, y, z) = (0,
0, 0)] of the coordinate system is positioned in the middle plane
of the simulation zone. The closely spaced ASDC nanorods have an outer
radius (R) and an inner radius (r) of 80 and 70 nm, thickness (t = R – r) of 10 nm, and gap distance (g) of 20 nm. The filling relative permittivity (ε)
in ASDC is set to air (ε = 1.00) and silica, respectively. The
lattice constant (a) of the arrays is 470 nm, and
the bottom silver film has a thickness (s) of 100
nm. In addition, the whole structure is placed on a silica substrate,
and the surrounding material is assumed to be air or n, where n is the RI of the surrounding medium.

Thanks to the rapid advances in
the fabrication technique of nanophotonic
structures, the proposed PNSs are compatible with the current fabrication
technology such as a manufacturing based on secondary electron lithography
generated by ion beam milling38−42 and other manufacturing processes.43 Superior
shell-to-shell uniformity with a well-ordered feature is established.40,42 Spacer lithography can construct uniformly patterned nanoshell arrays
with sub-10 nm thicknesses.40,44

3 Results
and Discussion
The EM wave coupling is mediated by diffraction
in the plane of
the ASDC nanorod arrays, which are composed of Ag-shell nanorods and
dielectric-core nanorods in a single structure. Upon the illumination
of the ASDC nanorod arrays with UV–visible–infrared
light, the hybrid modes are excited and exhibited as sharp spectral
peaks/dips in the optical absorptance/reflectance. These peaks/dips
are associated with a manifestation of light trapping in the ASDC
nanorod array system. The absorptance/reflectance spectra ascribe
to the lattice resonance and the coupling from the nanochannel waveguide
to the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode. Figure 2a,b shows the absorptance/reflectance spectra
of the coupled ASDC nanorods with different dielectric core, that
is, air and silica, where air and silica are the testing core materials
for the purpose of comparison and they can be replaced by other materials.
The top end of our proposed ASDC nanorod with air or silica core is
opened to the surrounding ambience and it can be realized by using
the fabrication processes as described in detail in ref (40). The solid Ag nanorods,
as counterpart for a solid or nonshell case, are also investigated
for the purpose of comparison. Because of the symmetry of the proposed
structures, polarization-insensitive absorptance/reflectance can be
easily realized.

Figure 2 (a) Absorptance and (b) reflectance spectra of the coupled
ASDC
nanorods with different dielectric core (air and silica). The results
include the data obtained for solid Ag nanorods which serves as a
counterpart (solid case) for the purpose of comparison.

As displayed in Figure 2a,b, there is one peak/dip with the maximum
absorptance and
minimum reflectance of 60.524 and 39.463% at λres of 955 nm for the solid case, and there are two peaks/dips with
the maximum absorptance and minimum reflectance of 93.656 and 6.323%
at λres of 855 nm for ASDC with air core and 98.489
and 1.496% at λres of 910 nm for ASDC with silica
core for peak/dip 1, respectively. For cases involving ASDC nanorods,
the absorptance/reflectance curves show two significant peaks/dips
with extremely high/small values. They represent two distinct types
of resonances, that is, the two narrow peaks/dips are result from
the surface lattice resonance and gap and cavity plasmonic resonance,
respectively.12 The number of absorptance/reflectance
peak/dip is dependent on the resonant modes in the PNS, that is, only
the SPR mode occurs in solid case, and for cases involving ASDC nanorods
both the SPR and CPR modes occur simultaneously. It is noteworthy
to point out that the corresponding peaks/dips of the absorptance/reflectance
spectra have the same λres. As the dielectric core
in the ASDC cases is changed from air to silica, the λres is red-shifted, which is in accord with previous literature studies.45 These resonances peaks and dips are attributed
to (1) the vertical GPR mode among incident EM wave, Ag/ASDC nanorod
arrays and the bottom Ag thin film (i.e., 100 nm thickness of Ag film
on the silica substrate) and (2) the transverse CPR mode between the
incident EM wave and the dielectric cores in the Ag shells. The vertical
Fabry–Pérot cavities of the ASDC nanorods waveguide
are formed by the dielectric cores, and the air gaps between metal
nanorods behave as the dielectric interfaces.3 With the help of the Ag film of the ASDC nanorods and the bottom
Ag thin film, the vertical GPR and transverse CPR modes can be well-excited.
As is well-known, the λres of PNSs is dependent on
the changing RI of the surrounding dielectric medium, a characteristic
that has been widely used for sensing applications. The case for ASDC
with ε = 1.00 (air) can be regarded as an SPR sensor, where
the change of ε in the cavity of the ASDC nanorods (e.g., ASDC
nanorods with silica core) causes a spectral shift and a large near-field
intensity variation.

To better understand the above-mentioned
phenomena, we calculate
the electric field intensity (|E|, V/m, Figure 3a), magnetic field
intensity (|H|, A/m, Figure 3b), absorbed power density
(Qe, W/m2, Figure 3c,d), and the surface charge
density distributions (coulomb/m2, Figure 3e) at the corresponding λres extracted from peak 1 for the solid case and peak 1 and peak 2 for
the ASDC case with silica core. From Figure 3, it is evident that the distribution profiles
of each resonance have good correspondence with each PNS structure.
It is obvious that the distribution profiles of |E|, |H|, and Qe are strongly confined in the gap region (i.e., gap enhancement)
at peak 1 and peak 2 for all the cases, while only the case of ASDCs
with silica core at peak 1 shows an enhanced distribution profile
of |E|, |H|, and Qe around their outer sides (i.e.,
edge enhancement). The gap enhancement profiles indicate that the
SPPs (i.e., GPR modes) were stimulated by the incident EM waves coupled
with the Ag/ASDC nanorods and the bottom Ag thin film.46,47 The localized distribution profiles of |E|, |H|, and Qe around the Ag MNPs, show that Peak 1 was induced by
the constructive interference, and this has enhanced the Ag MNP absorptance.48,49 The distribution profiles of |E|,
|H|, and Qe for the case of ASDC with silica core at peak 2 is localized between
the Ag MNPs and the Ag film, which indicates a stronger gap plasmon
mode occurring between the gap of Ag MNPs and also between the Ag
MNPs and bottom Ag film. They govern the absorptance and reflectance,33,46 hence resulting in stronger gap enhancement than that of the other
cases.

Figure 3 (a) Electric field intensity (|E|,
V/m), (b) magnetic field intensity (|H|, A/m), absorbed power density (Qe,
W/m2) in (c) x–y sectional plane and (d) x–z sectional plane, and (e) surface charge density (Coulomb/m2) distributions at the corresponding λres extracted
from peak 1 and peak 2 of the solid case and the ASDC case with silica
core.

The mechanism of these distributions
profiles in Figure 3a–d can be explained
by the surface charge density distributions, as shown in Figure 3e. The surface current
on the metal surface could be enhanced by the positive–negative
charge pairs and they induced the electromotive force. The surface
charge pairs of the solid case at peak 1 (λres =
955 nm) shows the same sign with an aggregation of (+ +) and (−
−) charges at the opposite sides of the Ag nanorods, and there
also is a weaker distribution of (+ +) (− −) on the
surface of the bottom Ag thin film. These surface charges exhibit
a typical dipole-like charge pattern, whose resonance is governed
by the GPR mode. For the ASDC with silica core at peak 1 (λres = 910 nm), the charge pairs distribute strongly and uniformly
in the form of (+ −) (+ −) on the rims and on the surface
of the Ag-shell nanorods, and (− −) (+ +) distribution
is observed on the surface of the bottom Ag thin film. There is also
a strong dipole-like charge pattern on the surface of inner/outer
rims and the bottom, which is governed by the vertical GPR mode. This
gives rise to a stronger dipolar effect and enhances the field pattern
around the gap and edge regions. Besides the GPR mode occurring on
the MNP-dielectric interface, the SPP waves are also included in the
light–electron interactions which happens between the incident
EM waves and the dielectric cores (or cavities) region. This produces
a strong coupling between the incident light and the electrons on
the inner and outer Ag-shell walls, hence bringing about the transverse
CPR mode in the nanocavities.48,50 A straightforward qualitative
understanding to this is that the inner electric field in the ASDC
is screened by the inner Ag-shell wall itself while the electric field
skin effect makes its coupling to the outer Ag-shell wall dominant.
As for the ASDC with silica core at peak 2 (λres =
1152 nm), the charge pairs distribute in the form of (− −)
(+ +) at the opposite sides of Ag-shell nanorods and (+ +) (−
−) on the surface of the bottom Ag thin film. In this case,
the distribution of the GPR mode is larger than that of the CPR mode
and this is due to the surface charge density in the gap region being
denser than that of the lateral sides. This can be verified by the
distribution profiles of |E|, |H|, and Qe, which
show stronger field patterns in the gap region than those of the cases
obtained from peak 1. This implies that the eigenmodes of peak 1 originate
mainly from hybrid plasmon mode of the neighboring Ag-shell wall,
which is caused by their strong mutual inductance and capacitive coupling
but not from the individual ring resonator.16 Its near perfect absorption and approximately zero reflectance utilizes
the Ohmic loss in the metal of the ASDC case. The resonance on the
surface and in the cavity of the ASDC can be tuned by changing the
geometric parameters of the structure, and this will be discussed
latter.

These lattice resonances can be tailored over a wide
spectral range
by changing the array lattice constant (i.e., period).11 The lattice constant, a, indicates
the density of the ASDC nanorods in the period arrays along x- and y-axis, and it has a significant
influence on the absorptance/reflectance spectra. To investigate the
influence of the lattice constant, a, the absorptance/reflectance
spectra for the case of ASDC (with silica core) nanorod arrays with a values in the range of [360, 370, 380, 400, 470, 500]
nm were examined, see Figure 4a,b. As can be seen that the peak 1 has a noticeable blue
shift with a stable magnitude of absorptance/reflectance as a is set in the range of [360, 370, 380, 400, and 470] nm,
whereas the absorptance/reflectance have a slight blue shift and a
decreasing (increasing) magnitude of absorptance (reflectance) as a is at 500 nm, indicating that the stronger coupling effect
occurred as a in the range of [360, 370, 380, 400,
and 470] nm. Note that the peak 2 and dip 2 of all cases possess the
resonance wavelength around λres = 1150 nm.

Figure 4 (a) Absorptance
and (b) reflectance spectra for the case of ASDC
(with silica core) nanorod arrays with different lattice constant, a = [360, 370, 380, 400, 470, and 500] nm. The other parameters
are the same as the ASDC (with silica core) used in Figure 2.

The absorptance and reflectance spectra can be also tuned
by t, h, R, and r, respectively. To better understand both the characteristics
of
the GPR and CPR modes, the effects of the thickness (t = R – r) of the Ag-shell
nanorods, outer radius (R), inner radius (r), and the height (h) of the ASDC nanorods
on the absorptance/reflectance spectra are examined. The results of
varying shell-thickness t in ASDC nanorods are shown
in Figure 5a,b, respectively.
The interaction between incident EM wave and ASDC nanorods could result
in the splitting of SPR modes that are hybridized from an outer Ag-shell
surface GPR mode and an inner Ag-shell surface CPR mode. The behavior
of absorptance/reflectance spectra ascribed by varying Ag-shell thicknesses
originates from capacitive coupling of the induced surface charges
at the side wall of the ASDC nanorod gaps. As the thickness of the
ASDCs increases from 8 to 13 nm, the λres is blue-shifted,
which is consistent with previous studies.51 As the outer dimensions of ASDC nanorods remain intact, the λres is sensitive to the thickness of the Ag nanoshell (i.e., t = R – r), which
blue-shifts from 940 to 820 nm for the case of peak/dip 1 and from
1220 to 1050 nm for the case of peak/dip 2, as the thickness is increased
from 8 to 13 nm. The stronger CPR can be obtained from increasing
the transverse cavity resonance using smaller t (e.g., t = 8, 9 and 10 nm) for peak/dip 1 while increasing the
transverse cavity resonance using larger t (e.g., t = 11, 12 and 13 nm) for peak/dip 2. The λres is blue-shifted with decreasing cavity size in ASDC nanorods. This
implies that, by adopting with a proper size of Ag shell-thickness,
one can carve out a cavity region to generate a contour PPA with tailored
absorptance/reflectance spectra at the desired λres. The key lies in the combination of the PNS with the photonic cavity
in ASDC nanorods. The cavity in ASDC nanorods dramatically influences
the resonance performance in PPA.

Figure 5 (a) Absorptance and (b) reflectance spectra
for the case of ASDC
(with silica core) nanorod arrays with different shell-thickness of t = [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13] nm. The other parameters
are the same as the ASDC (with silica core) used in Figure 2.

The absorptance/reflectance spectra for the case of ASDC
(with
silica core) nanorod arrays with varying outer radius (R), inner radius (r), and height (h) are investigated as shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.
As it is shown in Figures 6 and 7, different cavity dimensions
along transverse and vertical directions are demonstrated to be induced
by different plasmonic modes that could lead to different responses
required for plasmonic sensors. Being cavity in ASDC nanorods, the
cavity channel can provide inner resonant modes with a localized electric
field confinement far below the Abbe diffraction limit.40 The λres red-shifts with the
increasing R, r (i.e., increasing
the transverse cavity volume), and h (i.e., increasing
the vertical cavity volume). The varying R, r, and h would yield a change of the cavity
volume in ASDC and result in the change of the surface charge density
on the Ag-shell surface, which is related to the number of positive–negative
charge pairs, that is, varying electron density distributed on the
inner and outer Ag-shell of the ASDC,51 thus forming a strong-coupled mode which favors the near perfect
absorption with proper cavity volume in the ASDC nanorods. In particular,
the strong-coupled modes induce efficient broad band absorptance and
reflectance, whose spectral width and position can be manipulated
by changing ASDC nanorods radius (R–r) and height (h). This suggests that the
CPR with respect to the cavity volume of ASDC nanorods can be affected
by the coupling from R, r, and h. As the Ag-shell thickness of ASDC nanorods remains intact,
the λres red-shifts from 820 to 1020 nm with the
increasing R(r) in the range of
[60(50), 70(60), 80(70), 90(80), and 100(90)] (Figure 6a,b) and from 850 to 1000 nm with the increasing h in the range of [ 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130] (Figure 7a,b) for peak/dip
1 cases. It is worth mentioning that the performance of absorptance/reflectance
spectra are significantly affected by the size of R(r) for the peak/dip 1 cases and by the size of h for peak/dip 2 cases. In Figure 7a,b, the trend of absorptance/reflectance
spectra is quite different between peak/dip 1 and 2. There is a maximum/minimum
at h = 110 nm for the peak/dip 1, whereas the peak/dip
2 is monotone growing/declining with the increasing h. The discrepancies in the observed trends are attributable to the
difference of coupling effect arising from the vertical CPR corresponding
to the incident wavelength of EM wave and the length (i.e., h) of nanocavity channels in ASDC nanorods. Here, the band
linewidth of the coupled photonic–plasmonic resonance is associated
with the ASDC with cavity, which is linked to the Q-factor because of the modified photonic density of states and hence
the modified radiative damping rate. From the Figures 4–7, we observe
that the more the coupling effect on the SPRs and CPRs, the more absorptance
and less reflectance of the ASDC PPA exhibits. This implies that the
resonance arising from the ASDC PPA can be easily tuned by adjusting
its geometrical parameters.

for the case of ASDC
(with silica core) nanorod arrays with the outer radius of R = [60, 70, 80, 90, and 100] nm and the inner radius of r = [50, 60, 70, 80, and 90] nm. The thickness of ASDC is
kept at t = 10 nm. The other parameters are the same
as the ASDC (with silica core) used in Figure 2.

Figure 7 (a) Absorptance and (b) reflectance spectra for the case of ASDC
(with silica core) nanorod arrays with different height of h = [80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130] nm. The other parameters
are the same as the ASDC (with silica core) used in Figure 2.

For the nanoscale sensor applications, the ambient medium
is referred
to as the variation of RI. The testing sample surrounds the ASDC nanorods,
and the testing medium is usually in liquid or gaseous states.48,49 Calculating the absorptance and reflectance spectra for the proposed
structure, we investigated the ASDC (with silica core) nanorod arrays,
to the environmental RI perturbations. The sensitivity of the sensor
is dependent on the variation of the environmental RI surrounding
the PNSs. To verify the sensitivity of the proposed ASDC (with silica
core) nanorod array, the ambient RI of air (n = 1.00),
water (n = 1.33), and phosphate buffer saline52 are used, and the corresponding absorptance/reflectance
spectra are depicted in Figure 8a,b. A noticeable red shift in the position of the λres from 910 to 1160 nm is observed with the increasing RI
of the surrounding ambience. These features in the absorptance/reflectance
spectra indicate the superior sensing properties. The sensitivity
of RI sensors depends critically on the local electric field intensity
around the ASDC nanorods and the overlap of hot spots with the RI
of the surrounding ambience. This is shown in Figure 8a,b, where the absorptance/reflectance spectra
of the metasurface varies in response to the environmental perturbations.
In Figure 8a,b, the
two groups of resonant peaks and dips are both highly sensitive, although
the different plasmonic modes produce the different λres responses. The physical inference for these red shifts is due to
the effective increase in capacitance of the resonant structure attributed
to the increase in the RI of the analyte.10 The trend of peak (dip) of the absorptance (reflectance) spectra
shows a decreasing (increasing) with an increasing RI of the surrounding
ambience. This is caused by the lesser SPR and CPR effects when higher
RI of the surrounding medium is introduced into the PPA system. According
to the absorptance and reflectance spectra at peak/dip 1, the calculated
sensitivity, FOM, and Q factor can be achieved to
the values of 757.58 nm/RIU, 50.51 (RIU–1), and
60.67, respectively. Noting that the near perfect absorptance and
near zero reflectance resonant with a sharp band linewidth narrower
corresponding to their SPR and CPR modes in Figure 8a,b are upright to each other and well-separated
in wavelengths and in spatial distributions. Indeed, we find that
the absorbing bands of peak 1 in Figure 8a displays good Lorentzian line shapes, and
they are well-matched to the couple mode theory.10

to air (n = 1.00) and a surrounding medium water
(n = 1.33). The other parameters are the same as
the ASDC (with silica core) used in Figure 2.

In an infrared absorptance (reflectance) spectra, the peaks
(dips)
correspond to the molecular groups which absorb (reflect) the infrared
light at specific wavelengths, that is, it regulates the dipole moment
by all (or some) number of its vibration normal coordinates, and it
will surely result in some considerable infrared absorption bands.
Therefore, all sensors have to be examined with respect to their sensitivity
on marginal variations in the surrounding medium. The next sets of
data are derived from the testing of the responsiveness of the proposed
ASDC nanorod array under marginal conditions of the test sample (surrounding
medium of the ASDC nanorod array). Figure 8c,d shows a comparison of the electric field
intensity distributions (at the cross section across the ASDC nanorods
center at z = 0 nm and y = 90 ×
10–9 nm, respectively) and the surface charge density (including the 3-D profiles of electric force lines (pink lines)
and the energy flows (cyan arrows) of the proposed ASDC (with silica
core) nanorod arrays exposed to air (n = 1.00) and
a surrounding medium of RI, n = 1.33 (water). After
the ASDC nanorods adsorbed by the surrounding RI medium, a remarkable
gap enhancement and localization of electric field intensity distributions
can be found along the x axis because of the x-polarization of the incident EM wave. The electric force
lines and energy flow arrows of n = 1.33 (Figure 8d) exhibit an irregular
profile compared to that of n = 1.00 (Figure 8c), when the environmental
RI perturbation influences the ASDC nanorods system. The proposed
ASDC structure has a larger overspread capacity of the hot spots and
the ambient media, which is approachable to the variation of surrounding
medium, and would be applied not only for very sensitive RI sensing
but also for improving most monolayer sensitivity, making it a greatly
attractive PPA structure. More potentially, the localized electric
field enhancement of the lattice resonance mode combined with the
SPR and CPR modes is concentrated on the ASDC nanorod surface thus
easily attainable for the measuring target biomolecules in the near
infrared region.

4 Conclusions
We have
proposed a novel approach to the design of PPA which could
support both tunability and sensitivity for highly sensitive RI sensor
application. The influence of structure and material parameters, the
SPRs and CPRs on the sensing performance have been investigated by
3-D FEM. The mechanisms of absorptance and reflectance spectra have
been demonstrated to be induced by the different plasmonic modes generated
on the periodic ASDC nanorods grating. In our design, the PPA is tuned
by changing or modifying the device material and geometry. The proposed
ASDC PNSs with a Fabry–Pérot nanocavity is shown to
provide a means for reducing the band linewidth of the resonances,
and therefore ameliorating the sensing properties of PNSs. The optical
spectrum can be changed by varying the dielectric core of the ASDC,
and a near perfect absorptance and an approximate zero reflectance
having a sharp band linewidth can be obtained from the proposed system.
The proposed ASDC PNS can be operated as SPR sensor with the sensitivity
and FOM of 757.58 nm/RIU and 50.51 (RIU–1), respectively.
In addition, the open cavity of our proposed ASDC nanorod system is
accessible to the surrounding medium, and this makes it attractive
for RI sensor and filtering applications.
