Charged
nucleobases have been found to occur in several known RNA
molecules and are considered essential for their structure and function.
The mechanism of their involvement is however not yet fully understood.
Revelation of the role of N7-protonated guanine, in modulating the
geometry and stability of noncanonical base pairs formed through its
unprotonated edges [Watson–Crick (WC) and sugar], has triggered
the need to evaluate the feasibility of similar roles of other protonated
nucleobases [Halder et al., Phys Chem Chem Phys, 2015, 17, 26249]. In this context, N3 protonation
of guanine makes an interesting case as its influence on the charge
distribution of the WC edge is similar to that of N7 protonation,
though its thermodynamic cost of protonation is significantly higher.
In this work, we have carried out structural bioinformatics analyses
and quantum mechanics-based calculations to show that N3 protonation
of guanine may take place in a cellular environment, at least in the
G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis base pairs. Our results provide a reasonable
starting point for future investigations in order to address the larger
mechanistic question.

Introduction
Noncoding RNAs participate
in a wide variety of cellular processes,1 including regulation of gene expression,2 catalysis of biophysical processes,3 providing
scaffold to bring together multiple
proteins into an active complex,4,5 and so forth. To perform
such diverse functions, RNA has to fold into functionally competent
structures, whose complexities are often comparable to that of proteins.6 In proteins, the complex folded structures are
constructed using twenty physicochemically different amino acids,7 whereas RNAs use only four nucleotides which
are also physicochemically very similar.8 So then, how does RNA display such structural complexity and functional
diversity? A part of the answer possibly lies in biochemically mediated
variations in nucleobase properties. Different sources of such modifications
are post-transcriptional changes,9 metal
ion coordination,10 ionization11 and tautomerization12 of nucleobases, and so forth. Among them, though ionization of nucleobases
is thermodynamically unfavorable at the biological pH (∼7.4),a involvement of charged (mainly protonated) nucleobases
and their importance in modulating nucleic acid’s structure15−18 and function13,19−21 have been highlighted
in various contexts. In fact, charged nucleobases are expected to
be associated with RNA functionalities just as charged amino acids
have been found to be associated with different catalytic functionalities
of proteins (e.g., lysine (LYS) and arginine (ARG) in oxyanion hole
formation, histidine (HIS) in general acid–base catalysis,
and so forth.).7 It may however be noted
that because of the absence of hydrogen atom coordinates in the crystal
structures and ambiguity in detecting them within the solution NMR
structures, the charged nucleobases remain “invisible”
in the available RNA structure databases and their implications in
the RNA structure and dynamics can be studied only on the basis of
circumstantial evidence.22,23

It is unlikely
that an RNA base would be deprotonated as it would
give rise to a more negatively charged polyion. However, numerous
investigations using both biophysical and theoretical methods have
underlined the occurrence and importance of protonated nucleobases
in RNA.11,24 For example, the general acid role of the
C75 residue in the cleavage mechanism of hepatitis delta virus ribozyme
requires protonation at its N3 position,25,26 N3 protonation of A2486 in 23S rRNA of Haloarcula
marismortui (A2451 in Escherichia coli) is necessary for its general base role in the mechanism of peptide
bond synthesis;27 also, it has recently
been established that c-GAMP binding riboswitches use an N1-protonated
adenine to bind to its near cognate ligand c-di-GMP.21 Note that each nucleobase can be characterized by three
interacting edges, e.g., Watson–Crick (WC), sugar, and Hoogsteen
(C–H edge for pyrimidines).28 Protonation,
at a particular edge, changes its hydrogen bond donor–acceptor
network, as it converts a potential hydrogen bond acceptor site to
a hydrogen bond donor.22 At the same time,
protonation-induced charge redistribution modifies the hydrogen bonding
potential of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites of the other
two edges.29 Depending on whether the loaded
proton is sequestered between two nucleobases or is free to exchange
with the solvent, the protonated nucleobases have been categorized
into Class I and Class II, respectively.11 Class I protonated nucleobases, therefore, give rise to a new class
of base pairs (protonated base pairs), where two bases are connected
by at least one conventional interbase hydrogen bond and one additional
proton-mediated hydrogen bond.30,31 It is possible to identify
the protonated base pairs in RNA crystal structures using in-silico
algorithms, such as BPFIND.32 When two
mutually planar bases are found, where, in addition to one conventional
interbase hydrogen bond, two potential hydrogen bond acceptor atoms
from two different bases fall within the hydrogen bonding distance;
BPFIND considers one of them as protonated and hence forms a proton-mediated
hydrogen bond with the other. However, in Class II cases, the protonated
edge is not involved in base-pairing, irrespective of whether it interacts
with other bases or not. Thus, Class II protonation cannot be identified
using similar approaches, and we needed to consider other indirect
methods for the same.

Our approach for identifying possible
instances of Class II nucleobase
protonation mainly involved detailed characterization of geometrical
features of relevant bases and base pairs, both in the crystal structures
as well as after quantum chemical geometry optimization, with and
without involving a protonation hypothesis.23 The feasibility of existence of the putative base pairs, thus shortlisted,
was also subsequently assessed through the computational evaluation
of interaction energies. In the process, we could rationalize several
base-pairing scenarios, among which the cases of G:C W:W Trans and
G:G W:H Cis base pairs are remarkable. They occur frequently in RNA
crystal structures. However, unlike other base pairs, in gas phase
geometry optimization using different post Hartree–Fock (HF)
methods, they deviate significantly from their respective crystal
geometries.33−35 Various attempts were made to identify and characterize
the factors that stabilize these base pairs within the crystal environment.36−39 It has been established that crystal geometry of the G:C W:W Trans
pair (also known as the Levitt base pair) can be stabilized by positive
charge buildup (in the form of metal ion coordination,37,39 by post-transcriptional modification,36 etc.) at the Hoogsteen edge of guanine or by its involvement in
higher order interactions.38 In addition
to these factors, which are visible in the crystal structure, we have
shown that nucleobase protonation at guanine’s N7 position,
which is invisible in the crystal structure, can also stabilize the
crystal geometry of both G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis pairs.23 These observations related to N7-protonated
guanine underscore the importance of Class II nucleobase protonation
in modulating the geometry and stability of RNA base pairs.

In a similar way, analyzing the influence of other protonated nucleobases,
on subsequent base-pairing interactions involving their neutral edges,
should help in developing a comprehensive understanding about the
potential roles of Class II protonation. However, the large variety
of possible base-pairing interactions corresponding to different types
of Class II protonation (Table S1, Supporting Information), respectively, makes a comprehensive analysis
a formidable proposition. Therefore, to begin with, this study focuses
on the interesting case of N3 protonation of guanine, where, though
biophysical experiments suggest that it is unfavorable,40 its possible involvement in base-pairing interactions
is supported by the analysis of RNA crystal structures35,41 and quantum chemical studies.22 It is
significant to note here that though the protonation at both N7 and
N3 of guanine leads to similar charge redistribution at its WC edge,29 unlike in the case of N7 protonation, N3 protonation
at guanine does not result in weakening of the corresponding glycosidic
bond in RNA.42 The question is whether
this difference makes up for the energetic cost of protonation. We
have therefore limited our investigations, using RNA crystal structure
analysis and quantum mechanics (QM)-based calculations, to possible
biophysical consequences of Class II guanine N3 protonation in the
relatively high occurring model systems, G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H
Cis base pairs. The objective is to explore whether N3 protonation
of guanine has similar impacts on their geometries and stabilities,
as found in the case of N7 protonation.

Results and Discussion
It may be reiterated here at the outset that this approach toward
identifying possible Class II protonated base pairs is based on two
considerations: one is the closeness of the optimized structure to
the observed crystal structure and the other is the extent of base-pairing
stabilization, as computed for model systems without protonation versus
those with protonation at different possible sites. In principle,
for the protonated model systems, one could consider the base-pairing
stabilization as composed of two factors—the energy required
for protonation and the subsequent stabilization due to base pair
formation. This is expected to provide insights into “how”
the energetically unfavorable protonation takes place and how, through
consequent charge redistribution, the base pair formation is energetically
compensated. In this context, the relative ease of protonation at
N3 vis-a-vis that at N7 of guanine has also been examined.

Guanine N3
Protonation is Thermodynamically less Feasible than
N7 Protonation
The thermodynamic cost of protonation (ΔΔGprot) at the N3 position of guanine has been
reported to be significantly higher than that at the N7 position.29 Because it was also reported that the ΔΔGprot values are dependent on the level of theory
and dielectric constant of the medium,29 the ΔΔGprot values calculated
at the MP2 level were compared with the same calculated at four different
density functional theory (DFT) functionals, for example, M05-2X,
B3LYP, its long range-corrected (CAM-B3LYP) and its dispersion-corrected
version (B3LYP-D3(BJ)). Our results show that out of all the possible
sites of nucleobase protonation, the thermodynamic cost of protonation
is the maximum for protonation at guanine’s N3 position (Figure 1). This is generally
valid for both the gas and solvent phases and for all the five levels
of theory (Figure 1). However, the difference in the ΔΔGprot values for N3 and N7 protonation of guanine is the
least at the MP2 level; 16.8 kcal mol–1 in the gas
phase and 6.2 kcal mol–1 in the solvent phase. In
the gas phase, the difference is maximum at CAM-B3LYP (18.4 kcal mol–1), and in the solvent phase the difference is maximum
at M05-2X (8.7 kcal mol–1). Essentially, based on
this understanding that N7 protonation intuitively appeared to be
more probable, we had focused on base pairs involving N7 protonation
in our earlier work.39 However, detailed
studies with the two putatively N3-protonated base pairs tell a different
story, as is discussed below.

Comparison of N3 and N7
Protonation-Induced Charge Redistribution
at the WC Edge of Guanine
In general, protonation at any
imino nitrogen reduces the electronic charge density over all the
polar atoms in a nucleobase. As a consequence, the hydrogen bonding
potential gets improved for the hydrogen bond donor sites. At the
same time, the hydrogen bonding potential of the hydrogen bond acceptor
sites get compromised.29 In case of guanine
(Figure 2), protonation
at the Hoogsteen edge (at the N7 position) reduces the electronic
charge density on all the three polar sites of the WC edge (O6, N1,
and N2). As a result, hydrogen bonding potential of both N1 and N2
gets improved and that of O6 gets compromised. Previously, it was
shown that the resulting stronger H-bonds further stabilize the crystal
geometry of the G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis base pairs.23 Interestingly, analysis of partial charges obtained
from natural population analysis (NPA) suggests that protonation at
the sugar edge of guanine (at N3 position) also induces similar changes,
especially on the polar sites of the WC edge (Figure 2). In both the cases (N3 and N7 protonation),
such charge redistributions are associated with enhanced delocalization
of the lone pair of the exocyclic amino group into the ring π
system (Figure 2D).
The consequent changes in the hybridization state of the amino nitrogen
(sp3 → sp2) are characterized by (a)
shorter C2–N2 bonds (dC2–N2) and (b) depyramidalization of the exocyclic amino group. Hence,
it is expected that guanine N3 protonation should be able to stabilize
the G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis base pairs.

from NPA (at B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) level)
are reported as a fraction of elementary charge (e) for (A) neutral,
(B) N3 protonated and (C) N7 protonated guanine. (D) Conjugation between
the lone pair of electrons of the exocyclic amino group and the ring
π electrons. Red, blue, and black colors are used for oxygen,
nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms, respectively. Pyramidalization of the
exocyclic amino group has been characterized by the improper dihedral
angle (ψ) between C2, HS, HW, and N2,
where, HS and HW represent the hydrogen atoms
of the exocyclic amino group that belongs to the sugar edge and the
WC edge, respectively. The improper dihedral angle (ψ) and the
C2–N2 bond length (dC2–N2) are reported in degrees and Å, respectively.

Note that for G:G W:H Cis pair, the N3 protonation
may take place
at any of the two guanines. However, protonation at the N3 position
of guanine reduces the hydrogen bonding potential of both the polar
sites (N7 and O6) of its Hoogsteen edge (Figure 2B). Therefore, N3 protonation at the second
guanine (whose Hoogsteen edge is involved in the W:H cis pairing)
is not expected to stabilize the G:G W:H Cis pair. For this reason,
in this article, we have considered N3 protonation at only the first
guanine of the G:G W:H Cis pair (i.e., whose WC edge is involved in
the W:H cis pairing).

Analysis of the Neighboring Residues: Indirect
Support for Guanine
N3 Protonation Hypothesis
A protonated N3 is likely to be
closely associated with crystal water molecules. Accordingly, it has
been analyzed and found that (Table 1) out of the 202 occurrences [116 in HDRNAS and 86
in nucleic acid database (NDB)] of G:C W:W Trans base pair and 345
occurrences (123 in HDRNAS and 222 in NDB) of G:G W:H Cis base pair,
∼15% instances have at least one water molecule within the
3.5 Å distance of the N3 atom. It is to be noted that, 3.5 Å
is a well-accepted cut-off value for the donor–acceptor distance
of water-mediated hydrogen bonds in biological systems.43 Abundance of the water molecules in the neighborhood
of guanine N3 is indicative of the possibility of charge transfer
between the nucleobase and the neighboring environment.

Within
the crystal environment, if positive charge build up is
frequently observed at a particular edge of a base pair, it is expected
to have an influence on the geometry and stability of the base pair.
This is well-documented for the case of the Levitt base pair, where
positive charge build up is frequently observed in different forms
(post-transcriptional modification, metal ion coordination, etc.)
at the Hoogsteen edge of the guanine.36,39 This positively
charged environment further stabilizes the crystal geometry of the
Levitt base pair.36,37,39 Hence, the RNA crystal structures have been analyzed to find out
similar signs of detectable positively charged environment (such as
that provided by charged amino acid residues or metal cations) near
guanine’s sugar edge in G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis base
pairs. Contrary to expectations, Table 1 shows that metal ions or amino acid residues are rarely
observed within the 3.5 Å cut-off distance. It is known that
metal ions occurring within 3.5–6 Å of an imino nitrogen
of a nucleobase may interact with it through the water molecules of
its first coordination shell.44 A search
in this range also revealed only some more instances (13%) with at
least one metal cation, and even fewer instances (7%) with amino acid
residues, near the N3 atom. However, further increasing the cut-off
distance to 10 Å reveals an interesting picture. As shown in Table 1, ∼41% instances
have at least one metal cation and ∼22% instances have at least
one amino acid residue within the 10 Å distance of the N3 atom.
Figure S1A,B (in the Supporting Information) further show that among the amino acid residues, the ones with
positively charged side chains, for example, LYS, ARG, and HIS are
the most frequent in both the nonredundant datasets. Similarly, among
the metal cations, Mg2+ and K+ are the most
frequent ones (Figure S1C,D). Occurrences
of water molecules also increase significantly on increasing the cut-off
distance, for example, ∼29% (at 6 Å) and ∼43% (at
10 Å). In this context, it is important to note that a number
of biophysical studies have highlighted the importance of such long-range
electrostatic interactions in biological molecules.45,46 For example, Fersht and co-workers have shown that the pKa of the active site residue His-64 is affected
by the change of only one surface charge which is 14–15 Å
away from the active site of the serine protease subtilisin.47,48 Other studies on metal ion binding to proteins have revealed that
long-range electrostatic interactions can modulate the protein-Ca2+ binding affinity.49 It is evident
from the above discussion that similar to guanine’s Hoogsteen
edge in the Levitt base pair, positive charge build up is also frequently
observed at guanine’s sugar edge in these two base pairs. Hence,
possibility of positive charge buildup in the form of “invisible”
protonation cannot be ruled out.

Analysis of the Optimized
Geometries: Further Support for Guanine
N3 Protonation Hypothesis
Optimized Geometries with N3- and N7-Protonated
Guanine
The geometries of G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis base
pairs, optimized
using various quantum chemical methods, show that in the absence of
protonation of the guanine, their FOPT geometries are remarkably
different from their respective HOPT geometries (Figure 3). Root mean square
deviation (rmsd) between HOPT and FOPT geometries
are 3.8 and 2.7 Å, respectively, for G:C W:W Trans (Figure 3A) and G:G W:H Cis
(Figure 3G) base pairs.
Interestingly, both the FOPT geometries obtained with N3-protonated
(Figure 3E,K) and N7-protonated
guanine (Figure 3F,L)
are significantly close to the respective HOPT geometries
(rmsd < 1 Å). Therefore, as with N7 protonation, N3 protonation
of guanine may also be considered as a stabilizing factor for these
two noncanonical base pairs.

of G:C W:W Trans
(A−F) and G:G W:H Cis (G−L) base pairs obtained at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p).
The optimizations have been performed with three different protonation
states of guanine: neutral, N3-protonated, and N7-protonated. Interbase
hydrogen bonds are shown in broken lines. For each hydrogen bond,
the distance between hydrogen and acceptor atom (in normal font) and
the distance between the donor and acceptor atom (in italic font,
within parentheses) are reported in Å. Interaction energies (Eint) of the base pairs (calculated at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ)
have been reported in kcal mol–1. The values in
parenthesis represent the solvent-phase interaction energies. RMSD
values between the FOPT and HOPT geometries
are reported in Å.

Compensation for the Cost of Protonation
It is to be
noted that the FOPT geometries with N3-protonated guanine
(Figure 3E,K) have
noticeably shorter interbase hydrogen bonding distances and also are
significantly more buckled and propeller-twisted (Table 2) compared to N7 protonated
ones (Figure 3F,L).
It was shown that such changes in planarity of base-pairing interaction
(characterized by Buckle, Propeller Twist, and Stagger values), on
geometry optimization, are mediated by the interplay and balance of
different components of the interaction energies, of the exchange
repulsion (EX), and electrostatic attraction (ES) components.33 Thus, different components of the interaction
energies of the HOPT and FOPT geometries of
the N3- and N7-protonated systems, as shown in Figure 4, suggest that the comparatively more buckled
and twisted geometries of N3-protonated systems are associated with
comparatively larger increase in their EX component. This is of course
also accompanied by a concomitant compensating increase in the attractive
electrostatic component because of the shortening of the hydrogen
bonding distances. Further, the importance of the charge–dipole
interaction between the two pairing bases in determining the interaction
energy has been discussed in the context of Class I protonated base
pairs.22 Here, the positive charge center
is located closer to the base-pairing edge (i.e., the WC edge) for
protonation at the N3 position and hence is expected to influence
the charge–dipole interaction between the two pairing bases
to a greater extent. Consequently, the N3 protonated systems are also
associated with the comparatively larger increase in the polarization
(PL), charge transfer (CT), and ES components (Figure 4).

Distribution of the frontier orbitals corresponding
to the optimized
geometries of the N3- and N7-protonated base pairs are shown in Figure
S2 of the Supporting Information. Note
that these two base pairs have two interbase hydrogen bonds (H-bond)
between them. Formation of these interbase hydrogen bonds are such
that both the H-bond acceptors belong to the neutral base and both
the H-bond donors belong to the protonated guanine. Interestingly,
in the N3-protonated G:G W:H Cis pair, the LUMO is distributed over
the H-bond donors and the HOMO is distributed over the H-bond acceptors.
Therefore, a CT between HOMO and LUMO may stabilize the H-bonds along
the base pair. A similar complementary orientation of the frontier
orbitals is missing in N7-protonated pair.

These factors may
be collectively resulting in a higher interaction
energy which, in turn, may compensate for the higher thermodynamic
cost of protonation at the N3 position. For example, in the gas phase,
interaction energy of the N3-protonated systems are higher than that
of the N7-protonated systems by 5.6 and 6.8 kcal mol–1 for the G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis pairs (Figure 3), respectively. Considering the effect of
the solvent environment, the differences reduce to 2.7 and 3 kcal
mol–1, respectively (Figure 3). To understand the reason for such large
reduction, the contribution of the Hartree–Fock (% HF) and
the correlation (% corr) components of the gas phase interaction energies
of these two base pairs have been calculated (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). It has been found that
the interaction energies of both N3- and N7-protonated base pairs
are dominated by their respective HF components (% HF > 75%), though
the contribution of the correlation component is comparatively higher
for N7-protonated systems.

Consequences of guanine N3 protonation
are not limited only to
the formation of stronger base-pairing interactions. Rather, analysis
of the charge redistribution at the free edges of the two base pairs
(Figure 5) reveals
that both N3 and N7 protonation lead to improved H-bonding potential
of these free edges. Charge redistribution at a particular site is
quantified as the difference between the partial charges (Δq) of the paired base and isolated base. A negative Δq indicates better H-bonding potential for H-bond acceptors.
Again, a positive Δq indicates better H-bonding
potential for H-bond donors. Therefore, guanine N3 protonation in
the G:C W:W Trans pair results in improved H-bonding potential of
all the H-bond donor–acceptor sites at the Hoogsteen edge of
guanine and the C–H edge of cytosine. Similarly, guanine N3
protonation in the G:G W:H Cis pair results in improved H-bonding
potential of all the H-bond donor–acceptor sites at the Hoogsteen
edge of the first guanine and the WC edge of the second guanine. Such
improvements in the H-bonding potentials of the free edges are expected
to result in stronger higher order interactions, such as base triples.
Those stronger higher order interactions will further compensate for
the thermodynamic cost of protonation. Note that improvement in the
H-bonding potential of the free edges because of the N7 protonation
is somewhat limited. Rather, it has a negative impact on the H-bonding
potential of its sugar edge.

Figure 5 Change in partial charge distribution (Δq) at the H-bond donor–acceptor sites of the free
edges due
to base-pairing. Green text is used for sites with improved H-bonding
potential and red text is used for sites with reduced H-bonding potential.
All values are reported as a fraction of elementary charge.

Involvement of G:C W:W Ttrans
pairs in base triples and quartets
have already been studied comprehensively by Chawla and co-workers.38 Interestingly, G:G W:H Cis pairs also occur
frequently in isolated base triples and quartets. We have found that
in HDRNAS dataset, 88 out of 123 occurrences of G:G W:H Cis pairs
(i.e., 71.5%) interact with a third base to form a base triple. In
the NDB data set, the ratio is 54.5%, that is, 121 out of 222 occurrences.
Many of these base triples (22 in HDRNAS and 30 in NDB) are also part
of a base quartet. These base quartets are of 7 types as illustrated
in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Examples of
base quartets that involve a G:G W:H Cis pair. The
two guanine bases that form the W:H cis pair are labeled in blue.
Interbase hydrogen bonds are shown in broken lines. Out of the seven
base quartets shown, one belongs to cyclic topology (A), three belong
to star topology (B–D), and three belong to linear topology
(E–G). Details of the quartet topologies are described in http://quarna.iiit.ac.in/.

Effect of Dispersion Interactions
In order to account
for the dispersion interactions, FOPT geometry optimizations
have been performed using the MP2 theory and with dispersion corrected
DFT functionals, B3LYP-D3(BJ) and M05-2X. Note that M05-2X is highly
parameterized to account for middle-range dispersion effects, whereas
the DFT-D3 method in conjunction with the Becke–Johnson (BJ)
damping function accounts for both long-range and middle-range correlation
effects.50Figure 7 illustrates the optimized geometries of
G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis base pairs with N3- and N7-protonated
guanine. It shows that though there are noticeable variations depending
on whether dispersion correction is used or how it is implemented,
in general, the results obtained using the B3LYP-D3(BJ) functional
and MP2 theory are consistent with the results obtained using the
B3LYP functional, that is, (a) both N3 and N7 protonation of guanine
can stabilize the crystal geometry of G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis
pairs, which are otherwise unstable under gas phase geometry optimization,
(b) N3-protonated systems are more buckled and propeller twisted than
N7-protonated systems and also have shorter interbase hydrogen bonds,
and (c) interaction energy of N3-protonated systems are higher than
that of N7-protonated systems. It may however be kept in mind that
parameterized approach toward incorporating dispersion corrections
may involve error compensations arising out of different factors,
and one may observe discrepancies, in the general trends listed above,
for
specific cases.

Figure 7 Optimized geometries of the G:C W:W Trans (A−F)
and G:G
W:H Cis (G−L) pairs with N3- and N7-protonated guanine obtained
by the MP2 theory and DFT with M05-2X and B3LYP-D3(BJ) functionals.
Other annotations are same as shown in Figure 3.

This may be the reason why in the case of computations on
G:C W:W
Trans pair, using M05-2X functional, the results obtained show that
the FOPT geometry with N3-protonated guanine (Figure 7C) is similar to
the geometry obtained with neutral guanine (Figure 3D) and is significantly deviated from its
crystal geometry (rmsd = 2.5 Å). Another interesting observation
in this context is that, for B3LYP-optimized geometries, the buckle
and propeller twist observed in the FOPT geometries of
N3-protonated systems are comparatively higher than those for N7-protonated
systems (Table 2).
Such differences between the N3- and N7-protonated systems are not
observed at other levels of theory. It may be mentioned in this context
that graphene sheets, on geometry optimization at the B3LYP level,
retain their planarity but develop a curvature at the DFT-D levels
of the theory.51 This demands for a closer
look at the variation of the rotational (buckle, open angle, and propeller
twist) and translational (stagger, shear, and stretch) parameters
of the optimized base pairs because of the level of theory used for
optimization. As illustrated in Figures S3 and S4 of the Supporting Information, the three parameters
that define the planarity of a base-pairing interaction (i.e., buckle,
propeller twist and stagger) are more sensitive to the level of theory
used for optimization, at least for G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis
base pairs. Also, in comparison to the M05-2X functional, the trends
shown by the B3LYP-D3(BJ) functional are closer to that shown by the
MP2 level of theory.

Overall, the trends obtained from QM calculations
are also consistent
with the trends observed in instances of G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H
Cis base pairs present in the nonredundant RNA crystal structure datasets.
As shown in Figure 8, a number of instances of both the base pairs are associated with
similar high buckled and propeller-twisted geometries in the HDRNAS
dataset.

Conclusions
Following up on our
earlier work demonstrating the possibility
of base pairs involving N7-protonated guanine,23 we have investigated the possibility of other protonation
sites. As test cases, we have carried out quantum chemical studies
on the effect of N3 protonation of guanine on the geometry and stability
of the G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis base pairs, which are otherwise
unstable when subjected to gas-phase geometry optimization. Consistent
trends revealed by our studies at different levels of theory indicate
that, while both N7 and N3 protonation of guanine have very similar
effects on the geometries and stabilities of these base pairs, the
N3-protonated systems have greater stability associated with them.

Detailed energy decomposition studies have also been carried out
to rationalize the higher stability of the N3-protonated systems.
It may be concluded that both in terms of energetics as well as in
terms of consistency with observed nonplanar geometries, N3 protonation
appears to be a possible alternative stabilizing factor in the two
cases studied. This is despite the higher energy cost involved in
N3 protonation compared to N7 protonation.

This study opens
up an important area of investigation in understanding
the structure, folding, and function of RNA molecules in terms of
hitherto undetected protonation of bases.

Methods
Nomenclature
of Base-Pairing Interactions
As per Leontis
and Westhof (LW) nomenclature scheme, base-pairing interaction between
edge X of base M and edge Y of base N in cis orientation is represented
as MN cXY.28 However, the nomenclature
used in this manuscript is slightly different. The same base pair
is represented as M:N X:Y Cis. This sort of representation is also
intuitive, and at the same time, because of the presence of the text
delimiter (:), it is more convenient for parsing of metadata files,
especially when modified nucleobases (represented by more than one
character, e.g. 7MG, 2MA, etc) are involved. If the interbase hydrogen
bonds in a particular base pair involve any of the sugar atoms (O2′,
O3′, etc) a prefix “r” is added with the base,
e.g., G:rC W:S Cis.

Analysis of RNA Crystal Structure Datasets
For this
study, two different nonredundant sets of RNA crystal structures have
been analyzed, one is provided by the NDB52 maintained by the BGSU server and the other is provided by the HDRNAS53 database. As discussed earlier,39,54 on the basis of resolution (cutoff = 3.5 Å), chain length, R-factor, and so forth, further 838 and 167 structures have
been shortlisted from NDB and HDRNAS dataset, respectively (see the Supporting Information). Occurrences of G:C W:W
Trans and G:G W:H Cis base pairs within these sets of RNA crystal
structures were identified using the BPFIND32 software. Details of the BPFIND algorithm are discussed in the Supporting Information. Geometries of the detected
base pairs have been characterized by 3 rotational (buckle, open,
and propeller twist) and 3 translational (stagger, shear, and stretch)
parameters, as calculated by NUPARM55,56 package. Large
values of buckle, propeller twist, and stagger parameters indicate
the nonplanarity of the two bases. Large open angle, shear, and stretch
indicate deformation in the interbase hydrogen bonding. BPFIND estimates
the deviation of a base pair from its ideal planar geometry by the
geometry-based hybrid parameter called “E-value”.32 On the basis of the E-value, the least distorted
examples of G:C W:W Trans (515G:548C; 1N78 chain C) and G:G W:H Cis
(251G:254G; 3KNH chain A) were selected for QM calculations.

Geometry
Optimization
The base-pairing systems were
modeled, from the extracted crystal coordinates, by adding hydrogen
atoms at appropriate positions and by replacing the sugar and phosphate
backbone by a methyl group. As explained by Gatti and co-workers in
their recent article,57 both experimental58 and computational59 studies support that replacing sugar-phosphate backbone of nucleotides
by a methyl group does not influence the physicochemical properties
of base–base interactions. Further, our earlier calculations
on purine–purine reverse WC base pairs60 reinforce the argument that in the context of base pairs, such type
of modeling reduces the computational cost without compromising with
any important chemical information. The optimized geometries of the
modeled systems (base pairs and individual bases) were obtained in
two steps. First, all the non-hydrogen atoms were kept fixed at their
crystal coordinates and only the hydrogen atoms were allowed to change
their positions. Thus, these hydrogen-optimized (or HOPT) geometries represent the crystal geometry with hydrogens placed
at their respective minimum energy positions. The HOPT geometries
were further optimized, by removing all constraints, to obtain the
corresponding full optimized or FOPT geometries, representing
the minimum energy structure of the base pairs in the absence of the
crystal environment. Hessian calculations performed over the FOPT geometries confirm that they are not associated with any
imaginary frequencies. All the QM calculations have been performed
using Gaussian 09 software.61 RMSD between
the HOPT and FOPT geometries have been calculated
using the VMD software.62 The geometry
optimizations (HOPT and FOPT) have been performed
using the Becke, three-parameter (parameterized by Lee–Yang–Parr)
hybrid generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional (B3LYP63,64) and a double zeta basis set [6-31G+(d,p)]. B3LYP, is arguably the
most well-tested65−67 DFT functional for studying the ground state electronic
properties of nucleobases and similar systems. However, B3LYP does
not account for the dispersion interactions. To understand the role
of dispersion interactions in these base-pairing systems, the FOPT geometry was also obtained using the Møller–Plesset
perturbation theory68 with second order
perturbation correction (MP2) and dispersion-corrected DFT with B3LYP-D3(BJ)
and M05-2X functionals. The way of considering the dispersion interactions
are fundamentally different in B3LYP-D3(BJ) and M05-2X. In B3LYP-D3(BJ),
the dispersion correction has been empirically added by Grimme’s
method (third order) with Becke–Johnson damping,69,70 whereas in M05-2X,71 the dispersion correction
has been incorporated during the parameterization itself. For systematic
comparison, we have also used the CAM-B3LYP functional,72 which is the long-range corrected version of
B3LYP.

Interaction Energy Calculation
Interaction energies
of the optimized systems have been calculated as Eint = E(base pair) – ΣE(individual bases), using the MP2 theory and aug-cc-pVDZ
basis set. The CPCM74,75 implicit solvent model was implemented
to estimate the impact of a polar solvent environment (ϵ = 78.4)
over these interaction energies. Kitaura–Morokuma decomposition
analysis76 was performed using the GAMESS-US
software,77 to study the partitioning of
the two-body intermolecular interaction energies into electrostatic,
PL, CT, and higher-order coupling terms, within the HF approximation.
Though we have attempted to calculate the basis set superposition
error (BSSE) for the optimized base pairs using the counterpoise73 method, the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level wavefunctions
do not converge for some of the cases. Hence, the interaction energies
are reported without the BSSE correction. However, it may be noted
that earlier studies23 have reported that
for both the neutral and protonated G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis
base pairs optimized at the M05-2X/6-311G+(2d,2p) level, the BSSE
energy component is within 3–4 kcal mol–1 at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory.

As suggested earlier,29 the thermodynamic cost of protonation at a particular
site of a nucleobase has been determined by the change in free energy
(ΔΔGprot) of the following
process: neutral base + H2O → protonated base +
OH–. NPA78,79 was performed using
the NBO package80 incorporated in the Gaussian
09 software to study the charge distribution of the individual bases.
