The effect of geometrically rigid
trans α,β-unsaturated
ε-amino acids on the structure, folding, and assembly of α,ε-hybrid
peptide foldamers has been reported. From single-crystal diffraction
analysis, the unsaturated tetrapeptide 1 has stapler-pin-like
structure but without intramolecular hydrogen bond. The asymmetric
unit has two molecules that are stabilized by multiple intermolecular
hydrogen bonding interactions as well as π–π stacking
interactions between the aromatic rings of 3-aminocinnamic acid. Peptide 1 does not form organogel. But on hydrogenation, peptide 1 provides the saturated α,ε-hybrid peptide foldamer 2, which forms instant gel in most of the aromatic solvents.
The gel exhibits high stability. The unsaturated peptide 1 has porous microsphere morphology, but saturated analogue 2 has ribbonlike morphology. The gel has been used efficiently
for removal of cationic organic pollutants from waste water.

Introduction
To mimic the structure
and function of well-folded biopolymers,
like peptides, proteins, and DNA, synthetic oligomers containing designer
building blocks that exhibit distinct conformational characteristics
have promoted many recent advances in foldamers’ study.1−3 The incorporation of noncoded β-, γ-, δ-, or ε-amino
acids into folded structures with α-amino acid chains has been
widely used in the design of foldamers having hybrid backbones.4−6 Previously, foldamer studies mainly focused on design and synthesis
of new secondary motifs, a goal that is still alive, but recent trends
have expanded to include functionality in foldamers.7−10 Introducing a conformational bias by incorporating conformationally
rigid amino acid residues has been shown to increase the crystallinity
of foldamers.11 This is reported by substantial
solid state studies of peptides containing α-aminoisobutyric
acid (Aib) or allied α,α-dialkylated amino acid residues.12,13 But the crystallographic analysis of hydrogen-bonded novel hybrid
peptides has been possible in peptides containing stereochemically
constrained unsaturated amino acids, where the auxiliary degrees of
backbone torsional rotation have been restricted by unsaturation.14−16 For example, Gopi and co-workers have reported the unsaturated amino
acid-triggered folding of polypeptides.17 But controlling molecular orientation and diverse degrees of self-assembly
of unsaturated peptides in comparison to controlling those of their
saturated analogues is still challenging.18

Herein, we have synthesized a tetrapeptide containing trans
α,β-unsaturated
ε-amino acid and α-aminoisobutyric acid. Although the
3-(3-aminophenyl)propionic acid has been extensively investigated
in biology and material science,19,20 very little
is known about the conformational properties of the unsaturated analogue
3-aminocinnamic acid. The natural existence and very good bioactivities
of unsaturated amino acids motivated us to examine the conformational
preferences of these amino acids in hybrid peptides. Aib is helicogenic
and conformationally rigid. 3-Aminocinnamic acid is also geometrically
constrained. So introduction of Aib and 3-aminocinnamic acid will
be fascinating not only for molecular structure but also for directing
molecular orientation (for adjustment of steric factors) and crystal
packing (Figure 1).
Interestingly, the α,ε-hybrid peptide 1 exhibits
stapler-pin-like conformation in solid state. The two peptide molecules
in the asymmetric unit are antiparallel and stabilized by multiple
intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions and π–π
stacking interactions. Hybrid peptide 1 does not form
gel in organic solvents. However, on hydrogenation, peptide 1 provides saturated analogue α,ε-hybrid peptide 2, which forms instant gel in most of the aromatic solvents.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) reveals that
peptide 1 has porous microsphere morphology but peptide 2 has ribbons-like morphology. Moreover, the organogel of
α,ε-hybrid peptide 2 is used efficiently
to remove organic pollutants from waste water.

α,ε-hybrid peptides 1 and 2.

Results and Discussion
The noncoded
amino acid trans-3-aminocinnamic acid methyl ester
was synthesized by the condensation reaction between 3-nitrobenzaldehyde
and malonic acid in dimethylformamide–water medium at 120 °C
for 6 h, followed by esterification with thionyl chloride in methanol
at room temperature and finally the reduction of the nitro group with
iron–acetic acid at 100 °C for 3 h (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Methyl (E)-3-Aminocinnamate 6
The α,ε-hybrid peptide foldamer 1 was
synthesized using traditional solution-phase peptide coupling methodology
by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) as a coupling reagent (Figure 2). Foldamer 2 has been synthesized by reduction of foldamer 1 with hydrogen and Pd/C catalyst in methanol (Figure 2). The disappearance of characteristic cinnamic
acid signals and appearance of new signals for 3-phenylpropanoic acids
in the 1H NMR spectrum indicates the formation of peptide 2 from peptide 1. The synthesized compounds and
intermediates were purified by column chromatography and analyzed
by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), and mass spectrometry.

First, we have investigated
the assembly of α,ε-hybrid
peptide foldamers 1 and 2 in solution using
different spectroscopic experiments. The solution state UV/vis spectra
shows no change of spectral positions (249 and 278 nm for π–π*
transition), but intensity of absorption increases with increasing
peptide 1 concentration in methanol (Figure 3a). For peptide 2, the typical absorption band in methanol solution at 244 nm increases
with increasing peptide concentration (Figure 3b). The results suggest that irrespective
of unsaturation and rigidity, the intermolecular interactions for
both the peptides are similar.

Figure 3 UV/vis spectra of (a) peptide 1 and (b) peptide 2 with increasing concentration in
methanol.

FT-IR spectroscopy is a superb
experiment to investigate the structure
and self-assembly patterns of peptides. The unsaturated α,ε-hybrid
peptide 1 exhibits N–H stretching vibrations at
3365 cm–1 and amide I and amide II exhibit peaks
at 1677 and 1535 cm–1, respectively.21 However, the saturated α,ε-hybrid
peptide 2 shows N–H stretching vibration at 3430
cm–1 and amide I and amide II show peaks at 1651
and 1584 cm–1, respectively (Figure 4).21 Hence, the
peptide backbone changes on hydrogenation.

Figure 4 FT-IR spectra of peptides 1 and peptide 2.

To explore the molecular conformation and self-assembly pattern
of the 3-aminocinnamic acid containing α,ε-hybrid peptide
foldamer 1, single-crystal X-ray crystallography was
performed. Light yellow color monoclinic crystals of peptide 1 were obtained from methanol–water solution by slow
evaporation. There are two molecules of peptide 1 in
the asymmetric unit (Figure 5) in antiparallel arrangement.22 The two molecules are stabilized by four intermolecular N–H···O
hydrogen bonds between Aib NH and Boc C=O and 3-aminocinnamic
acid NH and Aib C=O. A strong face to face π–π
stacking interaction between 3-aminocinnamic acid moieties stabilized
the dimer. The centroid to centroid distance is 3.621 Å (Figure 6). The α,ε-hybrid
peptide foldamer 1 adopts stapler-pin-like conformation
in solid state. The ϕ and ψ values of the Aib residues
are in the helical region of the Ramachandran diagram. Table 1 shows the important backbone
torsion angles of peptide 1. In higher order packing,
the peptide 1 molecules self-assemble to form a porous
structure (Figure 7) through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and π–π
stacking interactions. The diameters of the pores are 4.4 and 6.1
Å. Table 2 shows
the hydrogen bonding parameters of peptide 1. We have
tried to crystallize peptide 2 from different solutions
but failed to obtain X-ray quality crystal.

To determine the conformational
properties of the peptides in solution,
NMR experiments were performed. The variable temperature 1H NMR experiment of peptide 1 in CDCl3 exhibits
very little shifts of the amide protons with increasing temperature,
indicating hydrogen-bonded stable structure in solution (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). Generally,
incorporation of small amounts of hydrogen bond-accepting solvents
like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 in CDCl3 solution of peptide results in monotonic downfield shifts
of exposed NH functions, leaving solvent-shielded NH functions almost
unaffected.29 The effects of adding DMSO-d6 to CDCl3 solutions of peptide 1 are reported in Figure S3 in
the Supporting Information. Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information shows that Aib(1), Aib(3), and Aca(4) NHs
are solvent exposed, as evident from their significant chemical shift
changes (Δδ −0.23, 0.33, and −0.39, respectively)
upon the addition of DMSO-d6 in CDCl3 solutions. Aca(2) NH exhibits very little chemical shift
change (Δδ −0.09) for peptide 1 even
at higher percentages of DMSO-d6. Therefore,
the results obtained from the solution-state studies are consistent
with the peptide 1 conformation in the crystal. Table S1 in the Supporting Information shows
Δδ values of all NHs for peptide 1. On the
other hand, temperature-dependent 1H NMR experiment of
the saturated peptide 2 in CDCl3 also exhibits
little shifts of the amide protons with increasing temperature, indicating
hydrogen-bonded stable structure in solution. Whereas on the addition
of DMSO-d6 to CDCl3 solutions
of peptide 2 (Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information), Aib(1) and Aib(3) NHs undergo significant
chemical shift change (Δδ 0.66 and 1.24, respectively).
Interestingly, AcaH(2) and AcaH(4) NHs exhibit minimal chemical shift
change (Δδ −0.22 and −0.11, respectively)
even at higher percentages of DMSO-d6.
The results suggest that peptide 2 forms intramolecular
hydrogen-bonded folded structure in CDCl3 solution.29Table S2 in the Supporting
Information shows Δδ values of all NHs for peptide 2.

Considering the porous structure of α,ε-hybrid
peptide
foldamer 1, a wide range of organic solvents were tested
to make gel by using the traditional heating–cooling technique
and other methods.23 But the unsaturated
tetrapeptide 1 did not form gel. On the other hand, the
saturated peptide 2 was found to form gel (Figure 8) in most of the aromatic solvents
like xylene, toluene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, etc. The phase-selective
gelation was confirmed by the inverted vial experiment (Figure 8).23 The transparent gel shows stability for 2–3 months at room
temperature.

Figure 8 (a) Inverted vial confirms the gelation of peptide 2 in xylene; (b) the phase-selective gelation of peptide 2 from xylene–water mixture.

The morphology of the α,ε-hybrid peptides was
examined
by field emission scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM) measurements.
For FE-SEM experiments, dilute solutions (0.5 mM) of corresponding
peptides were drop casted on microscopic glass slides and finally
dried under vacuum for 2 days. Figure 9 depicts the FE-SEM images of the peptides 1 and 2. From Figure 9a,b, the peptide 1 shows the polydisperse
microspheres morphology. The average diameter of the microspheres
is ca. 1 μm. From Figure 9c,d, the peptide 2 xerogel from xylene exhibits
ribbons-like morphology. The diameter of the ribbons is ca. 500 nm
and several micrometers in length.

peptide 1 showing polydisperse microspheres morphology.
(c, d) FE-SEM
images of the xerogel of saturated α,ε-hybrid peptide 2 from p-xylene showing ribbons-like entangled network.

The macroscopic character of the gel was obtained primarily
from
the rheology measurement.24 Both G′, a parameter for the elastic response of the gel
(the storage modulus), and G″, a measure of
the viscous response (the loss modulus), were examined at 25 °C
as a function of time. For organogel (10 mg/mL) of peptide 2, the storage modulus (G′) was found to be
approximately an order of magnitude higher than the loss modulus (G″), suggesting an elastic rather than a viscous
sample (Figure 10).
Such a rheological response is a characteristic, mainly shown by gel
networks that have physical cross-links through weak co-operative
interactions.24

Presently, water pollution by organic dyes is a
major problem for
the global community. Most of these dyes are discharged from textile,
cosmetic, and other industries. Even very low concentrations of dyes
in the waste water are undesirable as well as toxic for living cells.25 Most of these dyes are nondegradable due to
their robust chemical structures.26 In
this context, gels can be used to purify water from dyes.27,28 For this purpose, 1 mM solution of dyes rhodamine 6G (cationic),
methyl violet (cationic), methyl orange (anionic), and pyrocatechol
violet (neutral) was prepared. Then, 2 mL of these solutions were
placed in vials containing gel of α,ε-hybrid peptide 2 in xylene. The peptide 2 gel was found to absorb
the cationic dyes selectively. The reason behind the absorption of
only cationic dyes may be attributed to the presence of aromatic rings
and the amide bonds that make the peptide neutral but electron rich.
This electron-rich peptide can easily undergo attractive interactions
with the cationic dyes but not with anionic or neutral dyes due to
repulsive interactions. The absorption of dyes was very rapid, and
this was studied by UV/vis spectroscopy (Figure 11). Within 24 h, more than 95% removal of
the dyes was observed. The gel can also absorb a mixture of cationic
dyes (rhodamine and methyl violet) selectively from waste water (a
mixture of dyes, including cationic, anionic, and neutral dyes). The
results obtained have been included in the Figure S5 Supporting Information. The peptide 2 gel can
be reused several times for the cationic dye removal. For this purpose,
first, we let the gel absorb the dyes (cationic) and then the gel–dye
mixture was treated with deionized water.30 The mixture undergoes removal of the dyes.31 The process was repeated three times, and the removal (visually)
of dyes occurred in each case.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have discussed the effect
of geometrically rigid
trans α,β-unsaturated ε-amino acids on the conformation
and assembly of α,ε-hybrid peptide foldamers. The unsaturated
α,ε-hybrid peptide foldamer 1 has stapler-pin-like
structure in solid state. Two molecules of α,ε-hybrid
peptide foldamer 1 in the asymmetric unit are stabilized
by multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions and π–π
stacking interactions. Unsaturated α,ε-hybrid peptide
foldamer 1 does not form organogel. But on hydrogenation,
saturated α,ε-hybrid peptide foldamer 2 forms
instant gel in most of the aromatic solvents. The gel exhibits high
stability and can be used to remove cationic organic pollutants from
waste water efficiently. These α,ε-hybrid peptide foldamers
containing functionalizable carbon–carbon double bonds in peptide
backbone may provide advanced functional materials by postsynthetic
modification.

Peptide Synthesis
The peptide 1 was synthesized
by the traditional solution phase method.32 The amino acid C-terminus was protected by methyl ester formation.
Coupling was promoted by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). The peptide 2 was synthesized by hydrogenation of peptide 1 using hydrogen and Pd/C. The purification of products was done using
column chromatography on silica gel (mesh size 100–200), with n-hexane–ethyl acetate solution as eluent. The reaction
intermediates and final peptides were fully characterized by 1H NMR (400 and 500 MHz) spectroscopy, 13C NMR (125
MHz) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and FT-IR spectroscopy analysis.
Further, X-ray crystallography was performed to characterize the peptide 1.

mixed in 20 mL of dry DCM in an
ice-water bath. Compound 10 was then added to the solution,
followed immediately by 0.21 g (1 mmol) of DCC. The reaction was cooled
to room temperature and stirred for 48 h. DCM was dried, and the product
was mixed with ethyl acetate (40 mL), and dicyclohexylurea (DCU) was
filtered off. The organic layer was treated with 2 M HCl (3 ×
30 mL), brine (2 × 30 mL), and 1 M sodium carbonate (3 ×
30 mL). The extract was then dried by using anhydrous sodium sulfate
and concentrated under vacuum. The product was purified by silica
gel (100–200 mesh) using n-hexane–ethyl
acetate (3:1) as eluent to yield peptide 1 as a white
solid. Yield: 0.24 g (0.4 mmol, 48.19%). 1H NMR (400 MHz,

NMR Experiments
All NMR spectroscopy
were done on a
400 MHz Jeol or 500 MHz Bruker spectrometer. Compound concentrations
were in the 1–10 mM range in DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 solution.31

FT-IR
Experiments
FT-IR spectroscopy in the solid state
was performed with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum RX1 spectrophotometer using
KBr disk method.

Absorption Spectroscopy
The absorption
spectra of peptides
were measured on a Perkin Elmer UV/vis spectrometer (Lambda 35) using
a quartz cell having 1 cm path length.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The fluorescence spectra
have been recorded on a Perkin Elmer fluorescent spectrometer (LS
55) using a quartz cell having 1 cm path length. Slits of 2.5/2.5
width were used.

Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry
was carried out
on a Waters Corporation Q-Tof Micro YA263 high-resolution mass spectrometer
by electrospray ionization (positive mode).

Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy
Field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed to examine the
morphologies of the synthesized peptides. A drop of peptide solution
was casted on a clean microscopic glass slide and dried under vacuum.
The samples were gold-coated, and the images were captured in an FE-SEM
apparatus (Jeol Scanning Microscope-JSM-6700F).

Gelation
The peptide 2 (5 mg) was mixed
in 1 mL of solvent, and gel was obtained by heating–cooling
technique.

Rheology Experiments
To examine
the thixotropic behavior
and mechanical strength of the gel, we have done rheological measurements
on a MCR 102 rheometer (Anton Paar, Modular Compact Rheometer) by
a steel parallel plate geometry having 40 mm diameter at 20 °C.
The rheometer was attached to a Peltier circulator thermocube to control
the temperature accurately. The storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of the gel
were then recorded by using the setup.31

X-ray Crystallography
Diffraction quality light yellow
color crystals of peptide 1 were obtained from methanol–water
solution by slow evaporation. Intensity data were collected with Mo
Kα radiation by a Bruker APEX-2 CCD diffractometer. Data were
processed using Bruker SAINT package. The structure solution and refinement
were performed by SHELX97. Refinement of nonhydrogen atoms was performed
using anisotropic thermal parameters.31 Crystal data of compound 1: C32H40N4O7, Mw = 592.68, P121/c1, a =
21.5402(19) Å, b = 17.4732(14) Å, c = 19.4743(15) Å, α = 90°, β = 114.956(3)°,
