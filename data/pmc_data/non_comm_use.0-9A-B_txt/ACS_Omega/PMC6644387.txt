A novel hydrogel bead [tannic acid
(TA)–poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA)/sodium alginate (SA)] with high strength prepared by biocompatible
PVA, TA, and biocompatible SA via an instantaneous gelation method
was applied to remove methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. The
obtained TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads were fully characterized
by thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
so on. The adsorption performances of TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads
for MB were investigated by changing the factors of TA content, initial
concentration, pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and temperature
systematically. The maximum capacity of TA–PVA/SA hydrogel
beads for MB removal was obtained to be 147.06 mg/g at 30 °C,
whose capability was better than that without TA. After fitting the
adsorbed data, it was basically consistent with the Langmuir isotherm
and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic studies indicated
that MB removal was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. It is concluded
that the low-cost TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads as an easily recoverable
adsorbent have a great potential on the removal of hazardous dyes
from wastewater.

==== Body
Introduction
When dyes are used
to beautify the world, the wastewater containing
these hazardous materials produced from many manufactories using dyes
to whitewash their products, for example, textile, dyestuffs, paper,
and plastic, are wantonly spread into the biosphere.1 Once a certain amount of dyes or their degradation substances
enter into human body, the toxins can endanger people’s health
and even cause a variety of diseases, for instance, cancer, deformity,
mutation, and so on2 Methylene blue (MB)
as a common cationic dye is widely used in the field of textile, food,
paper, printing, and pharmaceutical industries, which is very harmful
for the organism because it can easily be associated with oppositely
charged cell membrane surfaces.3 Furthermore,
the color value of MB is very high, and it is clearly colored inside;
although the concentration is low (<1 mg/L), it is still considered
as a toxic colorant.4 Therefore, the removal
of MB from wastewater is an important environmental problem. Therefore,
the dyes containing wastewater must be fully treated before it is
discharged into the environment.

So far, several conventional
approaches have been developed to
remove MB from the simulated solution, including biological methods,
coagulation and flocculation,5 chemical
oxidation,6 membrane filtration,7 photocatalysis,8 and
adsorption.9 Among this, adsorption is
a flexible, simple, and effective method.10 It is worth noting that the key to adsorption is to find an adsorbent
with high removal rate and low cost. It plays a decisive role in the
removal of toxic substances.11

In
recent years, the three-dimensional network polymeric hydrogel
used as adsorbents has attracted wide attention.12 During the removal process, the dye molecules can quickly
permeate into the hydrogel network in solution and then combine with
the hydrophilic functional groups in its body, for example, −OH.
Therefore, the hydrogel adsorbents have good adsorption properties
and a great potential in practical applications of water purification.13,14 Recently, PVA poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels have been used more
and more in the field of sewage treatment because of their good mechanical
strength, chemical stability, hydrophilicity, high biocompatibility,
biodegradability, and so on.15 At the same
time, its structural integrity can be maintained during the deformation.16 As the report goes, a type of PVA hydrogel beads
are considered to be the adsorbent for the feasibility of adsorbing
MB dyes.15 The hydroxyl group in the adsorbents
plays a positive role because it has great affinities to cationic
MB after taking a negative charge. Agarwal et al. studied PVA to remove
bromothymol blue and MB from wastewater.17 Tannic acid (TA) is one of the natural organic matter because a
complex compound of polyphenol contains a number of o-dihydroxy and trihydroxy aromatic ring structures. This structure
has given it a series of unique chemical properties.18 Its benzene ring can produce π–π conjugate
with the benzene ring of the dye molecule.19 Nevertheless, TA is a water-soluble compound and has the disadvantage
of being leached by water when it used directly as an adsorbent.20 Bertagnolli et al. immobilized TA via polyethylenimine
to achieve effective adsorption of boron.21 It is worth mentioning that TA is involved in the mixed solution
of PVA and sodium alginate (SA) to form TA–PVA/SA hydrogel
beads, which can be utilized to purify the MB dye from sewage. TA
can increase the adsorption capacity and thermal stability. The reaction
between SA and CaCl2 can form a shell of hydrogel beads,
and the cross-linking of boric acid with hydroxyl groups on PVA can
further improve the stability of hydrogel beads.

In this work,
novel hydrogel beads were prepared easily via an
instantaneous gelation method and applied to the removal of MB from
aqueous solution. The assembled hydrogel beads were characterized
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Many factors affecting the MB adsorption from
the simulated solution by TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads were studied
in detail, including different TA contents, pH values, contact time,
initial concentration, different adsorbent dosage, environmental temperature,
and competitive ions. Besides, adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms,
introparticle diffusion, and thermodynamic analyses are further analyzed.
Finally, the optimal adsorption conditions will be obtained.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of Hydrogel Bead
The surface and cross-sectional
SEM images of TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads are presented in Figure 1. The diameter of
the hydrogel beads mainly ranges from 1.0 to 1.5 mm. As shown in Figure 1b, the surface of
TA–PVA/SA beads is an irregular gully shape. As is presented
in Figure 1d, the inner
part of TA–PVA/SA can be a three-dimensional network structure
with lots of open pores; this may be because of the hydrogen bonding
between the phenolic hydroxyl group in the TA molecule and the alcoholic
hydroxyl group in the PVA chain.22 These
structures will provide a convenient diffusion channel benefit to
remove MB dye by TA–PVA/SA beads.

Figure 1 SEM images of the TA–PVA/SA
hydrogel beads adsorbent: (a)
surface, (b) surface magnification, (c) cross section, and (d) cross-sectional
magnification.

Figure 2a presents
the FT-IR spectra of pure PVA, SA, TA, and the TA–PVA/SA hydrogel
beads. In the spectrum of TA–PVA/SA hydrogel, the peaks at
1200 and 1320 cm–1 are mainly supported by TA, the
bands at 2900–2950 cm–1 are mainly because
of PVA,23 and the bands ranging from 1560
to 1740 cm–1 are attributed to SA. As shown in Figure S1b, the color reaction between FeCl3 and TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads further confirmed the
successful immobilization of TA on the hydrogel beads. The results
indicate that the hydrogels are prepared by TA, SA, and PVA successfully.

Figure 2 (a) FT-IR
spectra, (b) TGA, and (c) derivative thermogravimetric
curves of the TA, PVA/SA, and TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads.

The TGA of the TA, PVA/SA, and
TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads
is shown in Figure 2b,c. It is presented that the first weight loss below 120 °C
is mainly because of the water evaporation that is adsorbed on materials.
With the increase of heating temperature, the TGA curves of TA and
two kinds of hydrogel beads (Figure 2a,b) show different stages. For TA, the second mass
loss lying in between 230 and 360 °C is attributed to the decomposition
of groups (e.g., oxygen-containing groups) and the oxidation of carbon,
and the third mass loss corresponds to thermal decomposition.24 For PVA/SA, the second mass loss lies in between
150 and 430 °C and the third loss falls into the range from 430
to 460 °C. For TA–PVA/SA gel, the second mass loss ranges
from 240 to 420 °C, which is mainly because of TA, and the third
mass loss ranges from 420 to 500 °C, which is mainly because
of PVA/SA.17 It can be seen that TA is
successfully introduced into TA–PVA/SA beads by comparing the
thermogravimetric curve of TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads with that
of PVA/SA and TA.

The TA–PVA/SA beads before and after
adsorbing MB were characterized
by XPS to evaluate the element of the dye, and the results are shown
in Figure 3. Compared
to the peaks of O 1s, C 1s, and Ca 2p in TA–PVA/SA beads, the
TA–PVA/SA bead-loaded MB can clearly observe S 2p and N 1s,
which are special elements of the MB dye. The results confirm that
the dye has been absorbed on the TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads adsorbent.

Effect of Different TA Content on MB Absorption
TA–PVA/SA
hydrogel beads containing different amounts which were prepared in
laboratory under the same conditions were compared to the adsorption
properties. As shown in Figure 4a, the hydrogel beads without TA and the adsorption amount
of MB on microspheres is the lowest. With the increase of TA ratio,
the adsorption capacity of TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads increases
gradually. When the ratio reaches 1:0.11, the amount of adsorption
reaches 147.06 mg/g. This is because TA contains a large number of
phenolic hydroxyl groups (−OH), which can hydrolyze to anions
(−O–) under basic condition, and the interaction
with MB is stronger. Thus, it can be inferred that the proportion
of TA is increased from 0 to 0.11, and the more −OH contained
in the hydrogel beads adsorbent, the more MB dye is adsorbed. Further
increase of TA content, the mixed solution (containing TA, PVA, and
SA) is too viscous to drop into solution (3% CaCl2-saturated
boric acid) to prepare the TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads. Therefore,
the TA–PVA/SA beads adsorbent with the ratio of TA–PVA
to 0.11:1 is used to adsorb MB dye.

Figure 4 Effects of different factors on the adsorption
amount of MB onto
the TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads: (a) TA content in TA–PVA/SA

(b) pH (cond. pH = 2–10, C0[MB]

120 mg/L, V = 100 mL, T = 30 °C, t = 12 h, pH = 9, dos. = 50 mg), (d) initial concentration
(cond. C0 = 20–160 mg/L, V = 100 mL, T = 30 °C, t = 12 h, pH = 9, dos. = 50 mg), (e) adsorbent dosage (cond. dos.
= 50–125 mg, C0[MB] = 120 mg/L, V = 100 mL, T = 30 °C, t = 12 h, pH = 9), and (f) temperature environment (cond. T = 20–40 °C, C0[MB] = 120 mg/L, V = 100 mL, t =
12 h, pH = 9, dos. = 50 mg).

Effect of pH on MB Absorption
The pH of the dye solution
may affect the dissociation of functional groups such as alcoholic
hydroxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups which worked as the active
sites of the adsorbent.25 The adsorption
experiments of MB on TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads are conducted
in different pH ranging from 2.0 to 10.0, and the results are presented
in Figure 4b. It could
be seen that the MB adsorption was highly pH-dependent, and the adsorption
of MB on TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads is favored at higher pH value.
The MB adsorption amount on TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads obviously
increased from 49.3 to 143.0 mg/g as the solution pH increase from
2.0 to 10.0. It has been reported that MB is a weak base and only
reacts in strong acid solutions to produce small amounts of protonated
cations. Therefore, it is certain that within the weakly basic pH
range in question, MB is a positively charged cation which is not
protonated.26 When the pH of the solution
is low, TA was mainly in the form of molecules, and the force between
MB and TA is weak. When the pH of the solution increases gradually,
TA can be partially dissociated into negative charge anions (−O–), interacting with the positive-charged MB stronger,
thus, resulting in the increase of the adsorption amount.

Effect of Contact
Time on MB Absorption
Contact time
is an important factor that indicates whether the adsorbent removes
the target contaminant to reach the equilibrium.27Figure 4c shows the relationship between contact time and the TA–PVA/SA
hydrogel beads’ capacities to adsorb MB. First of all, the qt increases fast within a short
time, for example, the removal amount reached 104.96 mg/g with 2 h.
The adsorption amounts reached about 140.86 mg/g when the contact
time is 12 h. Finally, the qt tends to be stable at 12–48 h, and the adsorption capacities
of the MB reach 144.19 mg/g. The adsorption amounts a rapid increase
initially owing to the high probability of the MB occupying site and
the excess active sites on the hydrogel beads. With the prolongation
of time, the sites on the adsorbents are occupied; the probability
of interaction between MB and the adsorption sites are lower; and
the adsorption gradually slows down and eventually tended to balance.

Effect of Initial Concentration on MB Absorption
The
removal amount is significantly affected by the initial concentrations
of dye solution.28 It is noteworthy that,
as the concentration increases, the adsorption amount increases rapidly,
until an inflection point occurs and the amount of adsorption tends
to be stable. The removal amount is 137.1 mg/g at 100 mg/L MB dye
initial concentration, which increases to 139 mg/g at 140 mg/L initial
concentration (Figure 4d). Its adsorption amount is quite similar. The initial concentration
is an important information for exploring the adsorption capacity
of adsorbents.29 At lower initial concentrations,
the adsorbents are relatively over-dosed and the sites are occupied.
With the increase of initial concentration, the adsorption capacity
increases gradually, and the sites are gradually occupied. At higher
concentrations, MB is relatively excessive, and the sites of the adsorbents
are almost all occupied. Even if the initial concentration of MB solution
is increased further, the TA–PVA/SA beads will not supply more
active sites for the MB molecules.30

Effect of Adsorbent Dosage on MB Absorption
The effect
of different TA–PVA/SA dosages on the adsorption process is
studied. Figure 4e
shows the relationship between removal amount of the MB and the dosage
of TA–PVA/SA beads, and the removal amount decreased from 147
to 84 mg/g as the dosage of TA–PVA/SA beads increased. Because
the initial MB concentration is fixed, when the TA–PVA/SA hydrogel
beads adsorbent amount increased, the total adsorption amount of MB
beads on the hydrogel beads increases, but the adsorption amount per
unit mass of TA–PVA/SA beads is decreasing, and the utilization
of adsorbent would be greatly reduced. Therefore, the dosage of 50
mg TA–PVA/SA hydrogel bead adsorbents are selected for other
experiments.

Effect of Temperature on MB Absorption
The effect of
temperature on the removal amount is an important factor to study
dye adsorption in industrial wastewater at different temperatures. Figure 4f shows the relationship
between temperature and removal amount of the MB. Obviously, the MB
dye removal capacity decreases as the temperature rises from 20 to
40 °C, which reveals that MB dye adsorption is exothermic in
nature. The decrease in adsorption amount might be because of the
increased solubility of MB with the temperature risen which causes
the dissociation of the adsorbed dyes. Another possible reason is
that the enhanced interaction of TA and PVA may reduce some of the
active adsorption sites at higher temperatures and thus reduce the
adsorption amount.31

Effect of Competitive
Ions on MB Removal
Dye industrial
wastewater contains a variety of impurities and MB coexists, such
as metal ions, salts, acids, and alkalis. Therefore, removing MB from
wastewater containing competitive ions is of great significance to
environmental safety. It has been reported that the presence of competing
ions may affect the adsorbent’s adsorption capacity.32Figure S2 shows the
change in adsorption capacity of MB because of the presence of competing
ions. Obviously, the addition of NaCl causes a reduction in the removal
rate of MB, and a further increase in the amount of NaCl has a significant
effect on the results. This is because the Na+ and Cl– ions in the solution can affect the electrostatic
interaction between the adsorbent and the target contaminant.33 Therefore, the decrease in adsorption capacity
is due to the fact that a large amount of positively charged Na ions
in the solution compete with MB at the same time for the active sites
on the adsorbent.

Adsorption Kinetic Study
The adsorption
mechanism is
provided by adsorption kinetics which is of a great significance in
wastewater treatment.34 To evaluate the
mechanism of MB dye adsorption onto TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads,
the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics were employed
to interpret the experimental data, as shown in eqs 1 and 2.

Pseudo-first-order
model35 1  

Pseudo-second-order model36 2  where k1 (h–1) and k2 (g/mg
h) are
the rate constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order adsorption,
respectively.

Figure 5a shows
the relationship between time and log(qe–qt) or t/qt. The rate
constants and the corresponding R2 values
of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order are given in the Table 1. The pseudo-second-order
model provides better correlation coefficients than that of pseudo-first-order
model, and the qe values are in good agreement
with experimental qe values which suggests
that the MB dye followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.

Introparticle Diffusion Study
The
adsorption process
can be divided into different steps, including the transfer of the
target contaminants to the surface of the adsorbent particles, then
to the active center of the adsorbent, and finally immobilize on the
active site through adsorption and complexation.37 Introparticle diffusion can reflect changes in the removal
rate of a target contaminant. Therefore, the Weber–Morris equation eq 3 could be used to identify
the controlled rate, as follows38 3  where kid (mg/g
min0.5) is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and C is the intercept.

Figure 5b shows the linear-fitted introparticle diffusion
model image, and the data obtained in the process of MB removal is
presented in Table 2, implying that three steps had happened. On the first stage, it
is a rapid process on adsorption, which can be attributed to the fact
that many active sites in the TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads can
be occupied by MB molecules. As the adsorption amount increases, the
active sites on the TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads decrease; the
adsorption is going to the second portion, whose rate is limited by
diffusion.39 In the last part, the adsorption
capacities is almost constant because the adsorbent sites are almost
entirely occupied at equilibrium.

Adsorption Isotherm Study
The isotherm
models of Langmuir
and Freundlich are employed to get more insights into the removal
process of MB dye by TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads. The Langmuir
isotherm model is assumed to have affinity for monolayer adsorption.
The adsorbent surface has the same active site and the adsorption
energy.40 Whereas the Freundlich isotherm
model is used to understand the adsorption of multiple adsorption
layer surfaces.41 They can be expressed
as the following equations, respectively.

Langmuir isotherms42 4  

Freundlich isotherms43 5  where qm (mg/g)
is the maximum amount of MB adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent
and KL (L/mg) is the constant related
to the maximum removal energy. KF (mg/g)/(mg/L)1/n and n are the Freundlich
constants related to the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity,
respectively. Figure 5c displays the adsorption isotherms of the MB removal from solution
by the TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads. In addition, the corresponding
parameters of the models and the fitted equilibrium data are presented
in Table 3. Results
showed that the Langmuir model gave a better description of adsorption
than the Freundlich model with R2 >
0.99
and the qm reaching 147.06 mg/g. The Freundlich
model, whose R2 values (0.85) are not
close enough to 1, was demonstrated such that it is unable to predict
the adsorption data process.

Thermodynamic Study
To understand the thermodynamic
properties of the MB dye adsorption process, thermodynamic parameters
such as standard entropy (ΔS°), standard
enthalpy (ΔH°), and standard Gibbs free
energy (ΔG°) were calculated. Their relations
are expressed by the equations as44 6   7   8  where, Kc is the
equilibrium constant and R (8.314 J/mol K) is the
gas constant. qe (mg/g) and Ce (mg/L) are the adsorption amount and equilibrium concentration,
respectively. The ΔH° and ΔS° were gained from the slope and intercept of plot
between ln Kc and 1/T45 and these parameters are listed in Table 4. The values of ΔG° are all less than zero for all studied temperature
ranges, indicating the spontaneous and viable nature of the adsorption
properties. ΔH° is a negative value, indicating
that adsorption of MB dye by TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads is exothermic.

Reusability of Adsorbent
The TA–PVA/SA hydrogel
beads for the dyes are reused for 5 cycles which are washed by 0.1
mol/L HCl solution as the eluent. In Figure 6, the first adsorption capacity is 123.06
mg/g, which is better than that of other cycles. However, with the
increase in the number of cycles, the adsorption amount can be maintained
at a steady value about 100 mg/g. It is clearly observed that the
TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads had effective properties for MB absorption
compared with other adsorbents of others (Table 5).

Conclusions
The TA–PVA/SA
hydrogel beads are easily prepared, and the
removal ability is probed by MB dye from simulated sewage. The experimental
results show that TA content plays an important role in the adsorption
of MB by TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads whose maximum removal amount
reaches 147.06 mg/g which is much better than that without TA. The
adsorption processes are well-described by the pseudo-second-order
model and the experimental data fit the Langmuir isotherm well. According
to thermodynamic studies analysis, TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads
removal of MB from simulated sewage is a spontaneous process with
exothermic properties. After five cycles of analysis, TA–PVA/SA
hydrogel beads still maintain good performance in removing MB dye.
Therefore, the new hydrogel beads are provided to remove dyes such
as MB from wastewater.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
chemicals are used without further purification.
TA (water soluble) was purchased from Aladdin. SA (AR), PVA (Mn = 80 000, AR), CaCl2, and
boric acid were purchased from Chemical Reagent Factory of Tianjin,
China. MB, a cationic dye with a molecular formula (C16H18ClN3S·3H2O), as shown in Figure 7, was supplied by
Aladdin and used as adsorbate. The ultrapure water (UW) (18.25 MΩ·cm)
was used in all experiments.

of MB.

Preparation of TA–PVA/SA
Hydrogel Beads
The
TA–PVA/SA hydrogel bead adsorbents were prepared by the following
steps: PVA (2.0 g) and SA (0.26 g) were placed into a flask filled
with 50 mL of UW under mechanical stirring in a 95 °C water bath
for 1 h. After complete dissolving, the solution was stirred for an
addition of 3 h at 65 °C. The TA solution was prepared by adding
0.22 g of TA to 10 mL of UW under ultrasonic dispersion for 15 min
at 25 °C and then added dropwise to the above mixture, and continued
to stir for 1 h at 65 °C. The appellant mixed solution was slowly
added dropwise to the stirring of 3% CaCl2-saturated boric
acid solution by a syringe (Figure 8). The TA–PVA/SA hydrogel beads were thoroughly
washed by UW and dried in a vacuum freeze-drying machine.

hydrogel bead adsorbents.

Characterization
The structure of the samples and the
chemical composition were characterized by the FT-IR (Nicolet iS10,
America). Determination of thermal stability of samples by TGA (Mettler-Toledo,
Switzerland) from 45 to 800 °C under nitrogen flow (20 mL/min)
with 10 °C/min. The microscopic appearance of the samples was
observed by SEM (FSM-5600LV, Japan) at 20 kV. The chemical composition
of the samples was subjected to XPS (Thermo Scientific, USA) analysis
using Al Kα radiation. The concentration of solutions before
and after adsorption was measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer
(UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan).

MB Adsorption and Desorption
The
adsorption of MB from
aqueous solution onto TA–PVA/SA beads composite was systematically
evaluated. Before adsorption experiment, a series of diluted MB solutions
were prepared with UW and were analyzed by a UV spectrophotometer
which records characteristic absorption peak of MB at 664 nm. First,
a certain amount of adsorbent was added to a 150 mL Erlenmeyer flask
having a certain concentration (100 mL) and placed in an isothermal
water bath shaker at 190 rpm. After a period of time, the supernatant
was centrifuged and the concentration was measured with an ultraviolet
spectrophotometer. Effect of different TA content (0–0.22 g),
different pH (2–10), TA–PVA/SA dosage (50–125
mg), contact time (0–48 h), initial MB concentration (0–160
mg/L), and temperature (20, 30, and 40 °C) have been explored
to evaluate the performance of sorbents. Then, the adsorption capacity
was calculated using eq 9(51) 9  where qt (mg/g) is the
adsorbed amount after time t, C0 and Ct (mg/L)
are the initial concentration and remaining
concentration after time t, respectively. V (mL) is the volume of MB solution and m (mg) is the weight of TA–PVA/SA beads.

The reusability
of TA–PVA/SA adsorbent was carried out in the repeating adsorption–desorption
process. TA–PVA/SA beads (0.05 g) after adsorbing MB were placed
in a glass bottle containing 0.1 mol/L HCl solution (100 mL). After
shaking for 1 h, the TA–PVA/SA beads were separated from the
solution and used for the following adsorption.
