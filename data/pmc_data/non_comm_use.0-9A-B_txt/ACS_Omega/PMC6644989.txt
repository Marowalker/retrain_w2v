An
Ag–TiO2 photocatalyst with 3.5 atom % silver
content, synthesized by a single step sol–gel method, possessed
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs; 1–5 nm) on the TiO2 surface, but owing to the nonplasmonic nature of AgNPs and the wide
band gap of TiO2, this material exhibited poor activity
in a photocatalytic degradation reaction. However, this least active
Ag–TiO2 catalyst showed a sudden increase in activity
during a photocatalytic amine self-coupling reaction showing the highest
activity, which was interpreted as amine (reactant) adsorption-driven
activity enhancement. We found that amine adsorption occurred over
AgNPs converting into plasmonic AgNPs as well as on the TiO2 surface reducing the band gap and therefore facilitated the visible
light excitation and the electron-transfer process efficiently, resulting
into overall enhancement in the photocatalytic activity. Thus, a very
efficient, stable, and visible light active photocatalyst (amine-adsorbed
Ag–TiO2) was developed by simply adsorbing an amine
in the least active Ag–TiO2 photocatalyst.

1 Introduction
Over
the last four decades, titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based
photocatalysts have gained much attention in the area of heterogeneous
photocatalysis for the removal of pollutants1 and for synthesis reactions,2 including
water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, to establish eco-friendly
and energy-sustainable chemical processes. There have been tremendous
efforts for designing new TiO2-based photocatalysts with
visible light absorption characteristics and reduced photogenerated
electron–hole pair recombination rate for efficient and visible
light-induced photocatalysis.3 The plasmonic
nanoparticles (NPs) of noble metals such as silver, gold, palladium,
platinum, and so on deposited on the surface of TiO2 have
been considered to be effective in visible light absorption and electron-transfer
process, facilitating the electron–hole pair separation and
thus enhancing the overall photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 photocatalyst.4 The plasmonic
NPs absorb visible light owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR; the collective oscillation of conduction electrons in the NPs
resonating with the electromagnetic field of the light) and excite
the conduction electrons for transfer to a reactant (electron acceptor)
to initiate chemical reactions. The holes created in plasmonic NPs
can trap the TiO2 conduction electrons and thus reduce
the charge recombination process in TiO2.

The silver,
being the cheapest noble metal with good electron-trapping
performance, has been considered to be suitable for the surface modification
of TiO2 by plasmonic NPs to have enhanced photocatalytic
activity under visible light irradiation.5 In addition, the interband electronic transition (of 4d electrons
to the 5d bands) in plasmonic AgNPs under UV light irradiation can
also induce the reactions.5a The photocatalytic
activity of the AgNPs themselves supported on inert or nonsemiconductor
metal oxides has also been reported;5a because
of the LSPR effect of the supported AgNPs, the chemical reactions
are conducted at ambient temperature by an efficient electron-transfer
mechanism under visible/solar light irradiation.

The TiO2-supported AgNP plasmonic photocatalysts have
been prepared by different methods and have been proven to be very
efficient in visible light photocatalysis.4,5 Here,
we report that an Ag–TiO2 catalyst, prepared by
a single step sol–gel method6 using
3.5 atom % silver concentration [designated as Ag(3.5)T], possessed
AgNPs (1–5 nm) on the TiO2 surface resembling a
TiO2-supported AgNP catalyst. However, owing to the nonplasmonic
nature of AgNPs and the wide band gap of the support (TiO2), the Ag(3.5)T catalyst exhibited poor activity in a photocatalytic
degradation (PCD) (of phthalic acid) reaction under UV light irradiation.
We found that the strong interaction between the AgNPs and TiO2 in the Ag(3.5)T catalyst resulted into an electron-deficient
TiO2 support, forming nonplasmonic AgNPs and widening the
TiO2 band gap. However, in the photocatalytic self-coupling
of benzyl amine (BA) to imine (Scheme 1), surprisingly, the Ag(3.5)T catalyst showed sudden
enhancement in activity during the reaction, which was interpreted
as the reactant (amine) adsorption-driven activity enhancement. The
adsorption of heteroatoms (X = O, S, or N) containing substrates on
the surface of a metal oxide photocatalyst can occur during the reaction;
the adsorbed molecules through heteroatoms create a new electron-donor
level above the valence band of metal oxide, which can easily transfer
the electrons (by visible light excitation) to the conduction band
of metal oxide and ultimately to an electron acceptor.4 Our investigation reveals that the adsorption of the amine
substrate in the Ag(3.5)T catalyst occurs not only on the TiO2 surface (which reduces the band gap) but also over nonplasmonic
AgNPs converting into plasmonic AgNPs and thus facilitates visible
light absorption and electron-transfer process efficiently showing
overall enhancement in photocatalytic activity. Thus, a least active
Ag–TiO2 photocatalyst could be converted into a
very efficient and visible light active photocatalyst. This finding
motivated us to develop an efficient photocatalyst (i.e., amine-adsorbed
Ag–TiO2) by simply adsorbing an amine on the least
active Ag–TiO2 catalyst for visible light PCD and
photocatalytic synthesis (PCS) reactions.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Activity of TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 Catalysts in PCD and PCS Reactions
The important
characteristics of the TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 catalysts with 0.18 to 3.5 atom % silver, synthesized by a single
step sol–gel method, are summarized in Table 1. The catalytic assessment of the synthesized
Ag–TiO2 catalysts for the PCD of phthalic acid,
as a model pollutant, in water under UV light irradiation (Figure 1a) shows that the
Ag(0.55)T catalyst is highest in activity and Ag(3.5)T is a least
active catalyst. The highest activity of Ag(0.55)T can be attributed
to its better features such as high surface area (98 m2/g), small anatase crystallites (7 nm), low-energy excitation characteristic,
and less agglomerated particles (Table 1, Figure 1b,c). In spite of visible light excitation characteristic (Figure 1b), the Ag(0.55)T
catalyst exhibited marginal activity in PCD under visible light irradiation
(see red color points in Figure 1a). In addition to the inferior characteristics of
Ag(3.5)T among Ag–TiO2 catalysts, viz., less surface
area (51 m2/g), big crystallites (23 nm), wide band gap
(3.16 eV), and agglomerated particles (Table 1 and Figure 1d), its poor performance in PCD was found to be greatly
attributed to the ineffectiveness of excess silver present as AgNPs
on the TiO2 surface, which has been discussed in the following
section.

In a previous
study on the synthesis of Ag–TiO2 with 0.75–3.5
atom % silver content by a single-step sol–gel
method, 0.75 atom % silver was found to be effective to control the
growth of crystallites and particles showing best physicochemical
properties and highest photocatalytic activity in the PCD of phthalic
acid.6 The crystallite size and the average
particle size of Ag–TiO2 were observed to be increasing
with increase in the silver concentration.6 The increasing amount of silver in Ag–TiO2 increases
the silver concentration on the TiO2 surface (because of
bigger size of Ag+ ions than Ti4+ ions, Ag+ ions migrate to the TiO2 surface), which promote
the growth of crystallites by the coalescence of adjacent crystallites
during calcination, resulting into big particles and their agglomeration.8,9 The results (Table 1 and Figure 1) show
that a lower concentration, that is, 0.55 atom % silver in Ag(0.55)T,
is even much effective to control the growth of crystallites and particles
providing best physicochemical properties (such as small size of anatase
crystallites and particles with uniform shape and size, less agglomeration
of particles, and high surface area) and the highest photocatalytic
activity in the PCD of phthalic acid. The formation of small anatase
crystallites in Ag(0.55)T can be attributed to the grain-boundary
pinning caused by silver ions (at 0.55 atom % concentration) limiting
the grain growth by the symmetry-breaking effects of the silver at
the boundary.10 The small and spherical
particles with homogeneous shape and size, and with less agglomeration
in Ag(0.55)T (Figure 1c), give high surface area, whereas the big agglomerated particle
in Ag(3.5)T (Figure 1d) provides less surface area.

To assess the potential of synthesized
Ag–TiO2 catalysts in a PCS reaction, the photocatalytic
self-coupling of
BA to imine (Scheme 1) was studied as a model reaction under UV light irradiation, in
acetonitrile (ACN; solvent) and in presence of air, at 30 °C.
Imines are important in the synthesis of a variety of compounds, and
their synthesis by photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amines using
TiO2-based and other photocatalysts is reported.11 Surprisingly, the catalysts having 0.55–3.5
atom % silver showed a sudden increase in activity (conversion of
BA) after 6 h of reaction (Figure 2) and the increase in activity was noticed to be more
prominent with an increase in silver content. Thus, Ag(3.5)T, the
least active catalyst in the PCD reaction, exhibited the highest activity
in a PCS reaction, that is, in the self-coupling reaction of BA.

Figure 2 Progress
of self-coupling reaction of BA with different catalysts
under UV light irradiation [93 μmol BA, 5 mL ACN, 10 mg catalyst,
in UV light (λ: 280–400 nm), in air, at 30 °C; selectivity
of imine: 100%; the conversion values reported are within ±2%
precision].

The adsorption-driven
activity enhancement in the bare TiO2 catalyst has been
reported for aerobic oxidation of amines
to imines under visible light irradiation.11e The surface-adsorbed amine molecules through N provide new electron-donor
levels above the valence band of TiO2 and facilitate visible
light excitation of electrons.4 The increased
activity of the catalysts (with 0.55–3.5 atom % silver content)
after 6 h of reaction can be ascribed to the adsorbed reactant (BA)
molecules in the catalysts during the reaction. The spent Ag(3.5)T
catalyst was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which showed
significant weight loss in the range of 200–750 °C (Figure S2), attributed to the surface-adsorbed
organic species. The possibility of the adsorption of BA molecules
in the Ag(3.5)T catalyst was confirmed by the TGA of the BA-adsorbed
Ag(3.5)T catalyst. The BA-adsorbed Ag(3.5)T and BA-adsorbed TiO2 (for comparison) catalysts were prepared by adsorbing BA
in both the catalysts in dark. For the adsorption of BA in the catalyst,
10 mg catalyst was suspended in dried ACN (5 mL) and stirred for 30
min in dark, and then BA (93 μmol) was added by a micropipette
in the solution. The solution was stirred for 2 h under closed condition
in dark, and then the catalyst was filtered, washed with methanol
(5 mL; 3 times), and dried at 70 °C for 5 h. The TGA profile
of BA-adsorbed Ag(3.5)T showed significantly very high weight loss
for adsorbed BA species than BA-adsorbed TiO2 (Figure S3), indicating higher adsorption capacity
of Ag(3.5)T for BA. Furthermore, the weight losses in TGA of the BA-adsorbed
Ag(3.5)T were at high temperatures, which can be ascribed to strongly
adsorbed (or chemisorbed) BA species, probably on the metal sites
(silver and TiIV sites).12 Thus,
it is evident that the enhanced activity of Ag(3.5)T and other catalysts
(with 0.55–3.0 atom % silver) during the coupling reaction
of BA (Figure 2) is
attributed to the adsorption of BA molecules in the catalysts.

2.2 Photocatalytic Activity of Amine-Adsorbed
TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 Catalysts
To
prove our assumption to be true, the BA-adsorbed catalysts were prepared
by adsorbing BA in all the catalysts in dark as discussed above. All
the BA-adsorbed catalysts gave increased conversion of BA in the coupling
reaction under UV irradiation for 3 h as compared to respective pristine
catalysts (Table 2)
and the adsorption-driven activity enhancement can be seen much significant
in Ag(3.5)T [∼10-fold as compared to the pristine Ag(3.5)T
catalyst]. Interestingly, the conversion with pristine Ag–TiO2 catalysts decreases with the silver content, whereas with
BA-adsorbed Ag–TiO2 catalysts, the conversion was
observed to be increasing with the silver content (Table 2), and thus, the BA-adsorbed
Ag(3.5)T gave complete conversion. It is to be noted that the pristine
Ag(3.5)T catalyst gave ∼95% BA conversion in 14 h (Figure 2), whereas the BA-adsorbed
Ag(3.5)T gave complete conversion in 3 h (Table 2).

Few amines
such as aniline-, pyridine-, and n-butylamine-adsorbed
Ag(3.5)T catalysts were also prepared by stirring 10 mg catalyst in
5 mL of ACN containing 93 μmol amine in dark for 2 h. Irrespective
of amine nature, all amine-adsorbed Ag(3.5)T catalysts exhibited enhanced
activity [as compared to the pristine Ag(3.5)T catalyst] in the coupling
reaction of BA under UV irradiation for 3 h giving almost complete
conversion of BA (Table 2). No cross-coupling product was obtained, which could have been
formed with aniline- and n-butylamine-adsorbed catalysts
because of leaching of amine and subsequent reaction with the reactant
(BA), indicating irreversible adsorption (chemisorption) of amine
molecules in the catalyst. The chemisorption of BA in Ag(3.5)T is
also evident from the high-temperature weight loss of the adsorbed
BA species in the TGA of the BA-adsorbed Ag(3.5)T catalyst (Figure S3). Interestingly, the BA-adsorbed Ag(3.5)T
[designated as BA–Ag(3.5)T] exhibited activity even under visible
light irradiation giving almost complete conversion of BA in 3 h (Table 2) as well as the fastest
PCD of phthalic acid (Figure 3). Thus, we found that the amine adsorption transformed a
least active Ag(3.5)T catalyst into an efficient and visible light
active catalyst.

Figure 3 PCD of phthalic acid under visible light (λ >
450 nm) irradiation
using pristine and BA-adsorbed catalysts [100 ppm phthalic acid aqueous solution (400
mL), 1 g catalyst, in air, at 30 °C; BA–TiO2, BA–Ag(0.55)T, and BA–Ag(3.5)T are BA-adsorbed TiO2, Ag(0.55)T, and Ag(3.5)T catalysts, respectively].

The results such as the increasing
activity of the Ag–TiO2 catalysts (0.55–3.5
atom % silver) after 6 h of the
reaction (Figure 2)
and the increasing activity of BA-adsorbed Ag–TiO2 catalysts with the silver content (Table 2) clearly suggest that the silver species
might be the major sites for the adsorption of BA in these catalysts
promoting their catalytic activity. Therefore, the silver species
in Ag(3.5)T were thoroughly characterized.

2.3 Characterization
of Silver Species in the
Ag(3.5)T Catalyst: Presence of Nonplasmonic AgNPs
Because
of much larger radius of the Ag+ ion (∼126 pm) than
that of the Ti4+ ion (∼68 pm), Ag+ ions
cannot enter the lattice of TiO2 to form a stable solid
solution. On calcination, Ag+ ions migrate to the TiO2 surface and form silver oxide or reduced silver (AgNPs) in
Ag–TiO2 materials depending on the concentration
of silver. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and elemental
mapping analysis of the Ag(3.5)T catalyst showed the presence of silver
and its uniform distribution over the TiO2 surface (Figure 4a,b). The nature
of the silver (ionic/oxidic or reduced silver) in Ag(3.5)T was characterized
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Figure 4c), and the silver was found
to be in reduced form (Ag0; 100%; binding energy: 368 eV).
The silver in the catalysts with <0.75 atom % silver content could
not be detected in XPS analysis. In Ag(0.75)T, silver was found to
be present as silver oxide (75%; binding energy: 367.19 eV) and reduced
silver (Ag0; 25%); however, we could not detect any particles/clusters
of the silver species by X-ray diffraction (XRD)/transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) probably because of very less concentration and/or
very small cluster/particle size of the silver species and their fine
distribution over the TiO2 surface. From XPS analysis,
it was found that on increasing the silver content in Ag–TiO2, the proportion of oxidic silver species decreases and that
of reduced silver (Ag0) increases; for example, silver
in Ag(2.5)T exists as 46.5% silver oxide and 53.5% Ag0,
and the Ag(3.5)T catalyst contains only Ag0. Thus, the
increase in silver content in the catalyst increases the amount of
Ag0; in Ag(0.75)T, Ag(2.5)T, and Ag(3.5)T, Ag0 was 25, 53.5, and 100%, respectively. The surface characterization
of Ag(3.5)T by TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis (Figure 4d,e) revealed the
presence of AgNPs (with the majority of NPs in 1–5 nm) on the
TiO2 surface resembling a TiO2-supported AgNP
catalyst. The existence of AgNPs in Ag(3.5)T was also confirmed from
the HRTEM image (Figure 4e) showing lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.125 nm, for (201)
planes of the metallic silver (Ag0).13 In addition, the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.36
nm for (101) planes of anatase TiO2 can also be seen in
the HRTEM image.

3d XPS,

the Ag(3.5)T catalyst, and (f) PL emission spectra of catalysts at
the excitation wavelength of 290 nm (*peaks represent various recombination
sites of TiO2;14 #peaks represent
recombination sites created by silver, which are absent in bare TiO2; the wavelength range of 529–650 nm is not shown because
of high signal of the second harmonic from the scattered excitation
light).

The Ag–TiO2 catalysts
with 0.18–0.75 atom
% silver show low-energy/visible light excitation characteristic,
exhibiting an additional band with absorption band edge at ∼530
nm in absorption spectra (Figure 1b), which was assigned to LSPR of silver species. However,
the catalysts with a higher silver content (>0.75 atom %) did not
show similar absorption/LSPR band, showing the nonplasmonic nature
of silver species. The decrease in band gap of Ag(0.55)T and Ag(0.75)T
as compared to bare TiO2 (Table 1) can be attributed to impurity energy levels
created by silver oxide species. The higher band gap of Ag(0.18)T
and Ag(0.37)T than bare TiO2 was the effect of crystallite
size reduction, whereas gradual increase in band gap with an increase
in silver content from 1.5 to 3.5 atom % can be ascribed to the increasing
AgNP–support interaction.15 The
significant widening of band gap in the Ag(3.5)T catalyst (as compared
to bare TiO2; 3.06 eV) is an indication of strong interaction
between AgNPs and the TiO2 support. The band gap widening
in SiO2-supported TiO2 catalysts was explained
as a strong SiO2–TiO2 interaction, showing
increased binding energies of TiIV and O.15 It is evident that in addition to the inferior features
of Ag(3.5)T among other Ag–TiO2 catalysts, the poor
activity of Ag(3.5)T in the PCD reaction can be ascribed to the wide
band gap of TiO2 and nonplasmonic nature of AgNPs, showing
no characteristic LSPR band (at ∼400 nm)16 in DRS (Figure 1b). The photoluminescence (PL) study revealed that AgNPs in
Ag(3.5)T are effective in reducing the charge carrier recombination
by capturing the electrons from TiO2 (showing reduced intensity
of the peaks as compared to bare TiO2 and highly active
Ag(0.55)T catalyst; Figure 4d), but the AgNPs are unable to excite the electrons by absorption
of the radiation energy (because of their nonplasmonic nature) for
the transfer to an electron acceptor (O2), exhibiting poor
activity in the PCD reaction. Numerous supported AgNP photocatalysts
(including AgNPs supported on the supports having a wide band gap),
synthesized by various methods, have been reported to exhibit excellent
activity in visible light-induced photocatalysis because of plasmonic
AgNPs.4,5 Therefore, we believe that the synthesis
by the present route results to Ag–TiO2 catalysts,
that is, Ag(3.5)T, with nonplasmonic AgNPs and a wide band gap of
TiO2.

In Ag 3d XPS of Ag(3.5)T, an additional peak
at 365.4 eV (other
than the Ag0 peak at 368.4 eV) was seen (Figure 4c), which was ascribed to the
decreased binding energy of Ag0 representing Ag0 atoms having increased electron density. In addition, the increased
binding energies of TiIV and O in Ag(3.5)T (Table S1) as compared to bare TiO2 revealed the reduced electron density on TiO2. The increased
electron density on Ag0 atoms is assumed to be at the AgNP–TiO2 interface because of accumulation of excess electrons coming
from TiO2 and by complexation of AgNPs with titanols (Scheme 2a). To align the
Fermi level positions of silver and TiO2, the electrons
migrate from TiO2 to AgNPs,17 creating high electron density on the interfacial Ag0 atoms and reduced electron density on TiO2. To fulfill
the need of electrons by AgNPs for the alignment of the Fermi levels,
the surface titanols may also be involved in complexation with interfacial
Ag0 atoms. The complexation of AgNPs with carbohydrate’s
hydroxyl groups stabilizing the AgNPs by a noncovalent interaction
has been reported to show the binding energy value of 365.4 eV for
Ag0.18 Thus, at the AgNP–TiO2 interface, there will be excess negative charges on Ag0 atoms (of AgNPs) and positive charges on TiO2 (Scheme 2b). This kind of
charge distribution at the interface could not polarize the electron
distribution in AgNPs to acquire negative charges (high electron density)
away from the interface, that is, on the surface of AgNPs, and to
show plasmonic nature. In the Ag/AgCl photocatalyst, the negatively
charged AgCl surface plays a crucial role to establish plasmonic AgNPs
by polarizing electron distribution in AgNPs (positive charges near
the interface and negative charges on the AgNP surface).19 The huge AgNP–TiO2 interface,
that is, more interaction between AgNPs and TiO2 in Ag(3.5)T
(because of fine dispersion and small size of AgNPs), created an electron-deficient
TiO2 support, which made the AgNPs of nonplasmonic nature.

2.4 Sites
for the Adsorption of Amine in Ag(3.5)T
and the Mechanism for the Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of Amine-Adsorbed
Ag(3.5)T
The adsorption of aniline in all the catalyst samples
was studied to find out the adsorption capacity of the catalysts for
an amine and also to observe the effect of silver content and nature
(oxidic/reduced silver) on adsorption amount. Aniline was selected
because of its less basicity as compared to other studied amines and
its comparatively better UV absorption characteristics. In the suspension
of catalyst (10 mg) in ACN (5 mL), aniline (93 μmol) was added
and stirred at room temperature in dark for 2 h. After adsorption,
the solution was centrifugated (5000 rpm) and then decanted. To find
out the amount of adsorbed aniline in the catalysts, the solution
was analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy (Agilent, Carry 5000) in
the wavelength range of 190–1100 nm. The results showed increasing
adsorption capacity of catalysts with silver content (Figure 5), and highest or almost complete
adsorption of aniline (9.9 mmol aniline/g) was observed in Ag(3.5)T.

Figure 5 Amount
of aniline adsorbed in various catalysts.

We also studied the effect of the amine concentration (molar
amount
of aniline: 50, 93, and 150 μmol) in solution (ACN; 5 mL) on
the adsorption and the subsequent effect of the adsorbed amount of
amine on the catalytic activity of the amine-adsorbed Ag(3.5)T keeping
the adsorption time (2 h) and the catalyst amount (10 mg) constant.
At 50 and 93 μmol amount of aniline in the solution, the complete
adsorption of aniline (>99%) in Ag(3.5)T was observed. However,
the
amount of adsorbed aniline in Ag(3.5)T at 50 μmol amount was
lesser (5 mmol aniline/g) than that at 93 μmol amount (9.2 mmol
aniline/g). The conversion of BA in the coupling reaction with the
aniline-adsorbed Ag(3.5)T catalyst containing 5 mmol aniline/g was
lesser (62%) than the catalyst having 9.2 mmol aniline/g (BA conversion:
99%). This result reveals that the more amount of adsorbed aniline
in Ag(3.5)T increased the conversion of BA, that is, the activity
of the catalyst. We found that at 150 μmol amount of aniline
in the solution, the adsorbed amount of aniline in Ag(3.5)T was slightly
increased to 9.9 mmol/g, and there was no significant increase in
conversion (99.5%) or activity of the catalyst. We also extended the
adsorption duration (from 2 to 6 h; at excess amount of aniline, i.e.,
150 μmol), but a slight increase in the adsorption amount (10
mmol aniline/g) was noticed with no further change (increase/decrease)
in the activity (conversion of BA: 99%). This study indicates that
the adsorption capacity of the Ag(3.5)T catalyst is ∼10 mmol
aniline/g, showing the highest enhancement in the activity. Thus,
we found that the amine-adsorbed Ag(3.5)T with 9.2 mmol aniline/g
(or prepared by adsorption using 93 μmol aniline solution) gave
substantially high activity.

The acidity of the bare TiO2, Ag(0.55)T, and Ag(3.5)T
catalysts was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia
(NH3 TPD) (Table 3) to confirm that whether the increase in silver content increased
the acidity of the Ag(3.5)T catalyst, showing the highest adsorption
of amine because of the surface acidic sites. The bare TiO2 was found to contain a negligible amount of acidity with very weak
strength, which may be generated by surface titanols. Ag(0.55)T possessed
a significant amount of acidity (1.42 mmol NH3/g; weak
and medium strength); however, Ag(3.5)T had nominal acidity (0.14
mmol NH3/g). Therefore, the surface acidic sites cannot
be the sites for amine adsorption in Ag(3.5)T. With increase in silver
content in the Ag–TiO2 catalysts, there is an increase
in proportion of Ag0 and also in the amount of amine (aniline)
adsorption (Figure 5), which clearly indicates that the AgNPs provide the major sites
for amine adsorption in the catalysts promoting the activity.

The characterization of BA–Ag(3.5)T
by XPS revealed that
the adsorption of BA occurred over AgNPs as well as on the TiO2 surface (Scheme 2c; see the Supporting Information for details). We found that the adsorption of BA on AgNPs in Ag(3.5)T
converted them into plasmonic AgNPs, showing a characteristic LSPR
band in DRS (Figure 6a). The adsorption of BA through N creates Ag+ sites (characterized
by a peak at 367.5 eV in Ag 3d XPS; Figure 6b) on AgNPs by shifting the electron density
in the interior.20 The bonding of an amine
with silver can occur by charge transfer from the highest occupied
molecular orbital at the amine molecule to the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (5sp orbitals) at the Ag+ sites.21 The electrons introduced by adsorbed BA in AgNPs will force
excess electrons accumulated at the interface Ag0 atoms
of AgNPs to be transferred to TiO2 to align the Fermi levels,
which is also evident from the disappearance of the peak at 365.4
eV (Figure 6b) and
lowered binding energies of TiIV and O as compared to the
pristine Ag(3.5)T catalyst (Tables S3 and S4). Thus, BA adsorption over AgNPs in Ag(3.5)T populated excess negative
charges on TiO2 at the interface, which polarized the electron
distribution in AgNPs, creating negative charges (high electron density)
away from the interface (Scheme 2d) to exhibit plasmonic nature. In addition, BA adsorbed
over the TiO2 surface (TiIV sites) in BA–Ag(3.5)T
will also increase negative charges on TiO2 polarizing
the AgNPs to show the LSPR effect.

Figure 6 (a) DRS of pristine catalysts and BA-adsorbed
catalysts, (b) Ag
3d XPS of the BA–Ag(3.5)T catalyst, and (c) PL emission spectra
of BA-adsorbed catalysts at the excitation wavelength of 290 nm (the
wavelength range of 529–650 nm is not shown because of high
signal of the second harmonic from the scattered excitation light).

Because of the LSPR effect, the
plasmonic AgNPs in the BA–Ag(3.5)T
catalyst can absorb visible light and easily excite the surface electrons
for transfer to an acceptor, and the positive holes (h+) created in AgNPs are transferred to TiO2. Thus, BA adsorption
in Ag(3.5)T facilitates the visible light absorption and charge carriers’
transfer process, resulting into enhanced catalytic activity. The
better charge-transfer mechanism in BA–Ag(3.5)T is also evident
from much reduced peak intensity in the PL spectrum (Figure 6c), showing much decreased
charge carrier recombination as compared to the pristine Ag(3.5)T.
Furthermore, BA adsorbed over the TiO2 surface (TiIV sites) in BA–Ag(3.5)T creates N-donor levels above
the valence band for the excitation of electrons under visible light
irradiation, showing red-shifted TiO2 absorption edge (reduced
band gap) in DRS (Figure 6a).4a

2.5 Dehydrogenative
Activity of the Amine-Adsorbed
Ag(3.5)T Catalyst
The oxidative activation of the substrates
such as amine, alcohols, and so on with the help of a photocatalyst
and O2 (oxidant) is widely reported for the PCS reactions.11,22 However, the PCS reactions under anaerobic condition (in the absence
of oxygen) is highly desirable for the selective conversion of a substrate
avoiding the active oxygen species-mediated undesirable oxidation
reactions. BA–Ag(3.5)T was also demonstrated to be efficient
in anaerobic condition (in N2 atmosphere) under visible
light irradiation for selective conversion of BA to the corresponding
imine (99% BA conversion in 3 h) and in selective dehydrogenation
of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (Table 4; 90% conversion in 6 h using excess volume
of the ACN solvent; Figure S8).

c Reaction using 14 mL ACN, in N2 atmosphere,
under visible light irradiation (λ > 450
nm), 6 h.

On comparing the
results with the reported photocatalysts studied
for both the PCS reactions, we noticed excellent activity of BA–Ag(3.5)T
in terms of selective and faster conversion of substrates.11,22 Thus, we found a catalyst, that is, BA–Ag(3.5)T, which can
activate the substrates such as amines and alcohols via dehydrogenative
mechanism (without the help of O2) and can be a promising
photocatalyst for selective organic transformations under anaerobic
condition and visible light irradiation. The plausible mechanism of
photocatalytic coupling of BA over the BA–Ag(3.5)T catalyst
is shown in Scheme 3; the dehydrogenation of BA with the help of BA–Ag(3.5)T (removal
of two protons and two electrons, followed by reduction of protons
into H2) produces an imine intermediate, which reacts with
a second molecule of BA to form the imine product. Under visible light
irradiation, the LSPR of plasmonic AgNPs in BA–Ag(3.5)T provides
energetic electrons to the protons (electron acceptor) for reduction
into H2 leaving positive holes (h+) in AgNPs.
TiO2 (by visible light excitation) supplies the electrons
to AgNPs (to react with h+) and receives the electrons
from BA (reactant) molecules.

Coupling of BA to Imine Product
over the BA–Ag(3.5)T Catalyst (CB: Conduction Band; VB: Valence
Band; DL: Donor Level)
2.6 Reuse of the Spent BA–Ag(3.5)T Catalyst
The stability of BA–Ag(3.5)T was confirmed from its reusability
in the next cycle of PCS reactions under visible light irradiation.
The spent BA–Ag(3.5)T catalysts, recovered from PCS reactions
(carried out under visible light irradiation) by filtration, were
washed with ACN (15 mL) and then with methanol (15 mL) and dried at
80 °C for 2 h. The dried catalysts were used in the next reaction
cycle of PCS reactions under visible light irradiation. The BA and
benzyl alcohol conversions with spent BA–Ag(3.5)T catalysts
were 97% (in 3 h) and 91% (in 6 h), respectively, showing similar
activity to the fresh BA–Ag(3.5)T catalyst. The TGA of spent
BA–Ag(3.5)T catalysts (used in both PCS reactions in visible
light) resembled the TGA profile of the fresh BA–Ag(3.5)T catalyst,
showing no significant decrease in adsorbed amine content (9.0 mmol/g).
The silver content in the spent BA–Ag(3.5)T catalyst was found
to be 3.49 atom %, indicating no significant loss of silver.

3 Conclusions
An Ag–TiO2 catalyst with
3.5 atom % silver, synthesized
by a single step sol–gel method, was found to be least active
because of the presence of nonplasmonic AgNPs and the wide band gap
of the TiO2 support. This catalyst could be transformed
into an efficient photocatalyst by amine adsorption on AgNPs converting
into plasmonic AgNPs as well as on the TiO2 surface narrowing
the band gap. The plasmonic AgNPs and reduced band gap of the amine-adsorbed
Ag–TiO2 catalyst facilitate the visible light excitation
and the efficient charge carriers’ transfer process, exhibiting
enhanced photocatalytic activity (as compared to the pristine catalyst).
Exceptional activity of the amine-adsorbed Ag–TiO2 photocatalyst under anaerobic condition and in visible light shows
an excellent scope of its application in selective organic transformations.
This report suggests to study different metals (Ag, Au, Cu, etc.)
loaded on semiconductors as well as on inert supports after adsorbing
various heteroatoms (N, S, etc.) containing organic molecules to devise
efficient plasmonic photocatalysts for visible light-induced photocatalytic
processes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
The chemicals used in the
experiments were of synthesis grade. Titanium tetra iso-propoxide (TTIP; 98%) was purchased from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd.,
India, and aqueous ammonia (25%) and phthalic acid (99%) were obtained
from S.D. Fine Chem. Ltd., India. Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was from Merck Ltd., India. The chemicals such as BA (99%; Spectrochem
Pvt. Ltd, India), aniline (99%; S.D. Fine Chem. Ltd., India), pyridine
(99%; S.D. Fine Chem. Ltd., India), n-butyl amine(99%;
S.D. Fine Chem. Ltd., India), benzyl alcohol (99%; Merck Ltd., India),
ACN (99.8%; Merck Ltd., India), and methanol (99%; Merck Ltd., India)
were used after drying with 3 Å molecular sieves for 24 h.23 Degussa P25 TiO2 [AEROXIDE TiO2 P25; anatase phase: 89%, crystallite size: 25 nm, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area: 50.2 m2/g] was gifted by Degussa (Germany).

4.2 Synthesis of Bare TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 Catalysts
The bare TiO2 was synthesized
by a sol–gel method;6 in the TTIP–methanol
solution (20 wt % solution), aqueous ammonia was added dropwise under
continuous stirring until the solution achieved a pH of 9–10.
The stirring of the resulting gel was continued for 2 h at room temperature.
The obtained gel was filtered, washed with methanol, dried at room
temperature (30 °C) for 2 h and then at 80 °C for 12 h,
and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h to get bare TiO2.

The Ag–TiO2 catalysts with 0.18–3.5 atom
% silver content (namely, Ag(0.18)T, Ag(0.37)T, Ag(0.55)T, Ag(0.75)T,
Ag(1.5)T, Ag(2.5)T, Ag(3.0)T, and Ag(3.5)T; the value in parentheses
denotes silver content in atom %) were synthesized by a single step
sol–gel method (Scheme 4),6 by dissolving the required
amount of AgNO3 in the TTIP–methanol solution (36
mL TTIP, i.e., 0.12 mol, and 160 mL methanol), followed by dropwise
addition of aqueous ammonia in the solution under stirring until a
pH of 9–10 was achieved. The resulting gels were filtered and
washed with distilled water several times to remove the nitrate ions,
followed by washing with methanol. The gels were dried at room temperature
for 2 h and then at 80 °C for 12 h and were calcined at 400 °C
for 4 h to obtain Ag–TiO2 catalysts.

Diagram of the Synthesis of Ag–TiO2 Catalysts
4.3 Characterization
of Catalysts
The
silver content (atom %) in the Ag–TiO2 catalysts
was estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP–AES; PerkinElmer Instrument, Optima 200 DV). The Ag–TiO2 samples (100 mg) were dissolved in HF solution (40%; 15–20
drops), followed by addition of 5 wt % boric acid solution making
up to 100 mL in a volumetric flask, which were analyzed by ICP. The
BET surface area of the catalysts was measured from a N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm study at liquid nitrogen temperature
(77 K) using ASAP 2010, Micromeritics after degassing the catalysts
under vacuum at 110 °C for 2 h. The XRD analysis of the catalysts
was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Advanced D8)
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a Lynx Eye
detector by scanning the sample in 2θ range of 15–80°
with a scanning rate of 0.02° s–1 and a time
per step of 0.1 s/step. The morphology of the catalyst particles was
analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (FEI instruments). The
EDX and elemental mapping analysis of the sample were carried out
by using a Field Emission Gun Nano Nova scanning electron microscope
(FEG-SEM) 450 with EDX. A TEM study was carried out by using a FEI
Tecnai (Philips, Holland) TEM instrument with an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV and the HRTEM analysis was performed on a FEI Titan HRTEM
instrument. The XPS analysis were carried out using VSW Scientific
Instrument (UK), equipped with the Al Kα source (1486.6 eV),
in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (in the range of ∼1–9
× 10–9 Torr), and the photoelectrons were detected
using a concentric hemispherical analyzer by keeping constant pass
energy (40 eV). The DRS of the catalysts were recorded under ambient
conditions in the wavelength range of 190–2500 nm using the
UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent, Carry 5000).
The PL emission spectra of the samples were measured on a fluorescence
spectrophotometer (LS 55 PerkinElmer), which was equipped with a xenon
lamp (450 W) as the excitation source. The emission spectra were recorded
with an excitation at 290 nm. TGA of the catalysts was carried out
using a TGA/differential scanning calorimetry thermal analyzer (Mettler
Toledo, STARe SF1052) by heating the sample from 25 to 800 °C
with the heating rate of 10 °C/min in the flow of nitrogen gas
(50 mL/min). The NH3 TPD of the catalysts was carried out
using Micromeritics (USA). The sample (50 mg) was heated at 100 °C
for 1 h under helium flow (30 mL h–1), and NH3 was adsorbed on the samples at 50 °C by exposing to
a flow of helium mixed NH3 gas (10%, 20 mL h–1) for 1 h. The desorption of NH3 was performed by heating
the sample up to 800 °C (12 °C min–1)
and was measured by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity
detector.

4.4 Typical Procedure for the PCD of Phthalic
Acid
In a photocatalytic reactor (quartz tube; placed in
a wooden box), 400 mL aqueous solution of phthalic acid (100 ppm;
prepared in deionized water) along with the catalyst (1 g) was charged.
The reaction was carried out at constant temperature (30 °C)
under continuous stirring, aeration, and light irradiation from the
source (UV light: Phillips high-pressure mercury lamp, 120 W, 280–450
nm wavelength; visible light: ASAHI Spectra, XHQA450 lamp, 300 W,
>450 nm wavelength). The degradation of the phthalic acid was monitored
by analysis of the reaction mixture (remaining concentration of the
phthalic acid in water) using a high-performance liquid chromatograph
(Dionex Ultimate 3000) with C8 column (Acclaim 120, 5 μm, 120
Å, 4.6 mm × 250 mm), ACN–water solvent system (50:50),
flow rate of 1 mL/min, and 235 nm wavelength of the photodiode array
detector at a constant column temperature of 25 °C.

The
irradiation of phthalic acid aqueous solution (in the absence of a
catalyst) did not show any reduction in the concentration, indicating
no photolysis of phthalic acid. In dark, the adsorption of phthalic
acid from aqueous solution (100 ppm) in all the catalysts was studied
and found to be in the range of 4.0–4.5%, showing almost similar
adsorption capacity of all the catalysts for phthalic acid. Therefore,
the variation in catalytic activity of the catalysts in the PCD of
phthalic acid (shown in Figure 1a) cannot be attributed to the adsorption behavior of the
catalysts for phthalic acid.

4.5 Typical Procedure for Photocatalytic
Self-Coupling
of BA to Imine and for Photocatalytic Dehydrogenation of Benzyl Alcohol
to Benzaldehyde
The PCS reactions (self-coupling of BA to
imine and for the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde)
was carried out in a nonaqueous medium (dried acetonitrile; ACN) at
constant temperature (30 °C) in air or in N2 atmosphere
(anaerobic condition) under UV–visible light irradiation (UV
light: Phillips high-pressure mercury lamp, 120 W, 280–450
nm wavelength; visible light: ASAHI Spectra, XHQA450 lamp, 300 W,
>450 nm wavelength) under continuous stirring. The substrate (BA/benzyl
alcohol; 93 μmol) dissolved in dried ACN (5 mL) was taken in
a quartz reaction tube (capacity; 30 mL), and the mixture was allowed
to be stirred for 5 min. In this mixture, 10 mg catalyst was then
added, and the reaction tube was placed in a chamber for irradiation.
After the reaction, the catalyst was filtered from the reaction mixture.
The reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A)
having a HP-5 (60 m) capillary column with a programmed oven temperature
from 50 to 280 °C, 0.5 cm3/min flow rate of N2 as the carrier gas and a flame ionization detector.

The conversion of substrate (BA/benzyl alcohol) was calculated on
the basis of its weight percent as follows:  

The selectivity of the product (imine/benzaldehyde)
was calculated
as below  

The products formed
in the reactions were characterized by gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis, and
the data were matched with those reported in the literature. GC–MS
analysis was carried out using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer
(Agilent 5975C GC/MSD with 7890A GC system) having an HP-5 capillary
column of 60 m length and 250 μm diameter with a programmed
oven temperature from 50 to 280 °C at 1 mL min–1 flow rate of He as the carrier gas and ion source at 230 °C.
