The
work reported here aims toward the optimization of electrode
preparation methodologies for superior performance of supercapacitors
through a rigorous understanding of underlying physical parameters.
Oxygen-functionalized few-layer graphene was employed as an active
material while binders [Nafion, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and
polytetrafluoroethylene], solvents for active material dispersion
[ethylene glycol and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)],
and electrode-drying temperatures (100, 170, and 190 °C) were
varied. Maximum specific capacitances at different electrode preparation
conditions ranged from 240 to 318 F g–1 at 1 mV
s–1 scan rate of cyclic voltammetry for the same
active material. The study revealed that the electrodes prepared using
the PVDF binder, the NMP solvent for active material dispersion, 170
°C electrode-drying temperature (slightly below the boiling temperature
of the solvent) provided the best electrochemical performance. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy revealed that the resistance for electron transfer
at the electrode/electrolyte interface can be minimized while mass
transport and pseudocapacitive charging can be improved significantly
by tuning electrode preparation methodologies which resulted in smaller
time constants and hence better capacitor performances. Scanning electron
microscopy images revealed that graphene layers were properly stacked
much similar to the synthesized nanomaterial wherein better electrochemical
performances were achieved, avoiding the agglomeration of nanomaterials
on the electrode surface. Low viscosity of the solvent for active
material dispersion and better solubility of the binder in the solvent
helped to reduce the agglomeration of nanomaterials by minimizing
the strong van der Waals interaction which causes agglomeration.

Introduction
Increasing energy demands
impelled scientists to design efficient
energy storage devices having superior power and energy densities.
In this regard, supercapacitors display enticing energy storage properties
such as high power density, rapid charging/discharging rates, and
longer cyclic life in comparison with conventional batteries.1,2 Energy storage through the physical adsorption/desorption of electrolyte
ions renders rapid charge/discharge rate and longer cycle life for
supercapacitors.3 Thus, supercapacitors
serve as one of the best alternative energy storage devices. They
are classified into two categories, which are electrical double-layer
capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. EDLCs store energy due to
the electrolyte ion accumulation at the nanomaterial interface,4−6 whereas energy storage in pseudocapacitors is due to the faradaic
redox reactions which occur at the electrode/electrolyte interface.7,8 Moreover, in the case of pseudocapacitors, only electron transfer
takes place at the electrode/electrolyte interface and avoids any
chemical reactions. Furthermore, energy storage in EDLCs is an electrostatic
interaction in nature, whereas pseudocapacitance can be classified
as an electron-transfer phenomenon. Different types of nanomaterials
such as covalent organic frameworks,9,10 metal–organic
frameworks,11 transition-metal oxides,12−14 conducting polymers,15 activated carbon,
and16 graphene17−21 have been shown as electrode materials for supercapacitor
applications. In this regard, high surface area, excellent electrical
conductivity, superior thermal conductivity, and so forth made graphene
an ideal supercapacitor material.18 However,
for supercapacitor studies, different research groups employed different
electrode preparation protocols and we envisioned that different methodologies
could immensely affect the performance of supercapacitors because
the morphology of nanomaterials can be altered during electrode preparation
which may inhibit achieving the best electrochemical performance of
a particular nanomaterial. In general, supercapacitor electrodes are
prepared from a mixture of an active material and a polymeric binder
which is deposited on the electrode by drop-casting the uniform mixture
of an active material and a binder in a solvent, followed by drying
in an oven at a particular temperature.

Herein, we report the
supercapacitor performance of oxygen-functionalized
few-layer graphene (OFG) as an active material at various electrode
preparation conditions. Three types of binders [Nafion, polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)], two different
solvents [ethylene glycol (EG) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP)] for OFG dispersion, and three drying temperatures (100, 170,
and 190 °C) were used to optimize the electrode preparation methodology.
Electrode preparation methodology for the supercapacitor performance
of OFG has been optimized utilizing the results obtained from cyclic
voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments,
and a rigorous analysis of physical parameters.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Electrodes
Nafion, PVDF, PTFE, NMP, and
EG were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Platinum (Pt) foil
and Pt wire were purchased from Alfa Aesar. A standard calomel electrode
(SCE) was purchased from CH Instruments, TX, USA. The chemicals were used without any further purification. Milli-Q
water was used throughout the experiments.

Synthesis of OFG
OFG was synthesized in two steps following
a reported method.20 Briefly, in the first
step, graphite was oxidized to graphite oxide (GO) by a modified Hummers’
method,22,23 and in the second step, GO was reduced by
formic acid at 160 °C to synthesize OFG.19,20 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of OFG was
240 m2 g–1, having a pore radius of 1.8–2.1
nm.20 Oxygen content in the material was
19% (atomic percentage) wherein hydroxyl, carbonyl, and acid functionalities
were 11, 4, and 4%, respectively.20

Electrode
Fabrication
In this work, electrodes were
fabricated using different methodologies to investigate the physical
parameters that influence the performance of supercapacitors. OFGs
with a binder coated on Pt foils were used as working electrodes.
A series of electrodes were fabricated using different binders (Nafion/PVDF/PTFE)
and different solvents (EG/NMP) for OFG dispersion at varied drying
temperatures (100, 170, and 190 °C). The active material (6 mg)
(OFG) and 1 mg of the binder (Nafion/PVDF/PTFE) were dispersed in
1 mL of solvent (EG or NMP). The solution mixture was stirred vigorously
for 6 h to impart homogeneity. After that, 100 μL of an aliquot
of the solution mixture was drop-casted on a Pt foil electrode in
an area of 1 cm2. Total mass loading on each electrode
was 0.6 mg/cm2. Then, the electrodes were dried in an oven
for approximately 20 h at a specific drying temperature (100/170/190
°C). The purpose of the binder is to keep the active material
attached on the electrode in the electrolyte solution. The dried electrodes
were used for electrochemical characterization.

Electrochemical
Experiments
All electrochemical characterizations
were performed on a biopotentiostat (model CHI 760D) and a potentiostat
(model CHI 620E) (CH Instruments, Austin, TX). A regular three-electrode
setup comprising saturated calomel electrode (SCE), Pt wire, and OFG
coated on Pt foil was used as reference, counter, and working electrodes,
respectively. All experiments were carried out at room temperature
in ambient condition with aqueous 2 M H2SO4 electrolyte.
CV experiments were carried out in a potential window of 1 V at different
scan rates (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s–1).
Galvanostatic charge/discharge studies were also performed in a potential
window of 1 V at different current densities (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10
A g–1). EIS experiments were obtained at a potential
of 0.4 V versus SCE with a 10 mV amplitude and a frequency ranging
from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz. It is important to note that 0.4 V is the
formal potential for the redox peak observed (vide infra) and the
origin of this redox peak is presumably due to the presence of hydroxyl
functionalities on the sheet edges of graphene.19,20 Capacitance (C) values from CV curves were calculated
using eq 1, wherein C, I, ν, and E denote
the capacitance, the current, the scan rate, and the potential range,
respectively. The numerator ∫I dE was obtained by calculating the areas obtained from CV curves. Similarly,
capacitances from the galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments were
calculated from eq 2.
In eq 2, t is the time taken for the charge/discharge process. Finally, specific
capacitance (Csp) values were obtained
by dividing the capacitance values with the mass of the active material
deposited on the electrodes. 1   2  

Scanning Electron Microscopy
For
SEM studies, the prepared
electrodes were directly placed on a conductive carbon tape and sputter-coated
with gold for 2 min. Experiments were done using a Carl Zeiss (ULTRA
Plus) FE-SEM at a working voltage of 20 kV. SEM image was also taken
for the as-prepared OFG, wherein the dried nanomaterial was spread
over a carbon tape and gold-coated for 120 s.

Results and Discussion
SEM Image
Comparison for Electrodes Prepared with Different
Binders
The SEM image of the as-prepared OFG is shown in Figure 1a which revealed
the stacked layered structure of the as-synthesized nanomaterial.20The SEM images of the electrodes prepared using
three different binders (Nafion, PVDF, and PTFE) are shown in Figure 1b–d, wherein
EG was used as a solvent for OFG dispersion and the electrodes were
dried at 170 °C. Figure 1b shows that when Nafion was used as a binder, the distribution
of OFG was not uniform on the electrode and significant agglomeration
was visible in comparison to the as-synthesized OFG (Figure 1a). On the other hand, the
PVDF binder resulted in a better morphology wherein entangled layered
stacking was visible (Figure 1c), much similar to the prepared OFG, which may provide better
access of electrolyte ions inside the nanomaterial toward the enhancement
of specific capacitance. Figure 1d highlights that when PTFE was used as a binder, although
sharp edges were detectable, agglomeration of layered stacks was visible
which could inhibit the diffusion of electrolyte ions inside the pores
in comparison to PVDF. Low-resolution SEM images at the same electrode
preparation conditions are shown in Figure S1.

SEM Image Comparison of
Electrodes Prepared in Different Solvents
for OFG Dispersion
Electrodes prepared using different binders
demonstrated that PVDF provided the most uniform morphology; hence,
PVDF was chosen as a default binder while solvents for OFG dispersion
were varied and the electrodes were dried at 170 °C. Figure 2a shows that the
NMP solvent provided excellent stacked graphene layers which were
comparable with the as-synthesized OFG (Figure 1a). Furthermore, prominent sharp edges were
also noticeable. Figure 2b shows that the EG solvent also resulted in layered stacking, albeit
the layers were entangled, which could restrict the electrolyte ion
diffusion inside the pores. Low-resolution SEM images at the same
electrode preparation conditions are shown in Figure S2.

SEM Image Comparison of Electrodes Dried
at Different Temperatures
The PVDF binder and the NMP solvent
for OFG dispersion provided
a better morphology on Pt electrodes, and hence these two conditions
were chosen while electrode-drying temperatures were varied. At 100
°C drying temperature, slight agglomerations of graphene layers
were observed which may inhibit electrolyte accessibility (Figure 3a). However, the
electrode dried at 170 °C resulted in an excellent stacking of
graphene layers (Figure 3b), whereas the electrode dried at 190 °C resulted in a severe
agglomeration which could be due to the rapid evaporation of the solvent
(Figure 3c). It is
important to mention that the boiling point of NMP is 202 °C,
and these results suggest that the electrodes dried at a temperature
very close to the boiling point could be detrimental. Low-resolution
SEM images at the same electrode preparation conditions are shown
in Figure S3.

The electrodes were prepared using the PVDF binder and the NMP solvent
for OFG dispersion.

In summary, the SEM results
indicated that PVDF, NMP, and 170 °C
were the best binder, good solvent for OFG dispersion, and best electrode-drying
temperature, respectively. In the next few sections, we discuss the
electrochemical results and unravel the connectivity between SEM and
electrochemistry.

Electrochemical Results
Electrochemical
measurements
were performed to investigate the supercapacitor performances of different
electrodes. As an example, electrodes prepared using the PVDF binder,
NMP as a solvent for OFG dispersion, and 170 °C electrode-drying
temperature have been discussed rigorously in this section, and this
experimental condition also provided the best supercapacitor performance
(vide infra). CV experiments furnish relevant information regarding
the charge/discharge behavior. An ideal double-layer capacitor shows
a rectangular CV curve wherein the current rapidly rises to reach
a plateau value within few millivolts of applied potential which indicates
a fast charging behavior,24 whereas a faradaic
process exhibits peaks in CV due to the electron transfer across the
electrode/electrolyte interface.25Figure 4a shows rectangular
CV curves for OFG which was due to the fast adsorption/desorption
of electrolyte ions and hydroxyl functionalities present on the sheet
edges of graphene, resulted in a modest faradaic peak.19,20 Specific capacitances were calculated from the CV curves using eq 1, and the values ranged
from 318 to 197 F g–1 (Table 1). The specific capacitance values increased
at slower scan rates because more electrolyte ions can percolate inside
the pores of the electrode at a longer time scale (Figure 4b and Table 1). To further verify the electrochemical
performances, galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments were performed
and the obtained results were in agreement with those of CV wherein
the specific capacitance values ranged from 331 to 213 F g–1 (Figure 4c and Table 1). The charge/discharge
curves were symmetrical, with a good linear relationship behavior,
a characteristic of the capacitive behavior (Figure 4c). Similar to CV, the specific capacitance
values dropped at a higher current density because of the less diffusion
of electrolyte ions at a faster time scale (Table 1). Retentions of specific capacitances with
increasing scan rate of voltammetry and current densities were 62
and 64%, respectively (Figure 4b,d and Table 1). In a long-term cyclic test, 100% specific capacitance retention
was observed after 5000 cycles, indicating the superior stability
of OFG as a supercapacitor (Figure S4).

EIS results provide in-depth insights of physical
parameters such
as diffusion kinetics of the electrolyte inside the nanomaterials,
electron-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface,
and double-layer charging at the electrode/electrolyte interface.26 In a Nyquist plot, imaginary component of impedance
(Z″) is plotted against real component of
impedance (Z′) (Figure 4e), whereas in a Bode plot, phase angle is
plotted against log(frequency) (Figure 4f). The impedance characteristics of a supercapacitor
swing in between a pure resistor (phase angle 0°) and a pure
capacitor (phase angle 90°). At high frequencies, the electrochemical
system behaves like a pure resistor because capacitance is inversely
proportional to the frequency which causes a near-zero impedance for
a capacitor. Intermediate-frequency regions are affected by physical
parameters such as porosity, morphology, thickness of the nanomaterials
deposited on the electrode, etc., which affects the diffusion of electrolyte
ions from the electrolyte to inside the nanomaterials, and in low
frequencies, it behaves like a capacitor.27 A semicircle is usually observed in the high-frequency region of
Nyquist plot (Figure 4e), and the diameter of the semicircle on the real axis provides
the resistance toward electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte
interface (Ret) which was found to be
0.3 Ω (Table 2). The plot displayed a sharp rise of impedance parallel to the Z″ axis in the intermediate-frequency region, representing
an excellent capacitive behavior (Figure 4e). The intersection of the straight line
observed in the intermediate-frequency region with the high-frequency
regime provides the “knee frequency” which is attributed
as the starting frequency at which the diffusion of electrolyte begin
because at high frequencies, the time scale is too short for diffusion
to occur.16 Beyond the knee frequency,
the electrodes predominantly behave like capacitors and contribution
toward the specific capacitance is maximum in this time frame.28 The knee frequency in this specific case was
found to be 317 Hz, and the high value implies the faster diffusion
of electrolyte ions inside the nanomaterials. The highest phase angle
value was 81.2° (close to 90°), indicating an excellent
capacitive behavior (Figure 4f). EIS results were further analyzed utilizing an equivalent
circuit model (Figure 5), and the results are summarized in Table 2. The solution resistance (Rs) has been placed in series with all other circuit elements
because the current passes through the electrolyte solution at all
frequencies. A constant phase element (CPE, Qdl) was used to represent double-layer charging just at the
electrode/electrolyte interface at a very fast time scale (Figure 5). A CPE has been
used instead of a capacitor presumably because of the inhomogeneity
or roughness of the interface.29 At the
high-frequency region, the current flows through Qdl after passing through Rs. As the frequency decreases, the impedance offered by Qdl increases rapidly, and hence at the intermediate-frequency
region, the current passes through Ret and diffusion capacitance (Qd) which
represents the capacitance obtained due to the diffusion of electrolyte
ions inside the pores of the nanomaterials (Figure 5). Rdes represents
the resistance for ion desorption from the nanomaterials, and for
a good supercapacitor material, a high value of this parameter is
desirable. In the low-frequency region, the current passes through Rdes because Qd offers
very high impedance. Finally, the current passes through Qps which represents pseudocapacitive charging, that is,
the passage of electrons inside the nanomaterial.

a Electrodes were dried at 170 °C.

To further analyze EIS results, RC time constants
(τRC) were calculated using the following formula:
τRC = Rs × Cdl, wherein Cdl represents
the double-layer capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte interface
at a very fast time scale. Cdl was calculated
from the value of Qdl utilizing the following
equation: Cdl = Qdl × (ω)(a1–1), wherein the ω value was taken where imaginary component of
impedance was maximum in the high-frequency semicircle region.

To gain further insights, complex capacitance calculations were
performed. The complex capacitance (C(ω)) is
defined by eq 3a, wherein C′(ω) and C″(ω)
represent the real and imaginary parts of complex capacitances and
are further defined by eqs 3b and 3c, respectively.30 3a   3b   3c  

Figure 6a shows
the real part of capacitance (C′(ω))
change versus frequency. The variation of capacitance with the frequency
portrays electrolyte ion penetration inside the pores of nanomaterials
at a particular frequency. At lower frequencies, the electrolyte ions
can access the pores deep inside the nanomaterial and hence C′(ω) increases. However, at high frequencies,
the electrolyte ions can only access the surface of the pores and
hence C′(ω) decreases. At very high
frequencies, it behaves like a resistor and C′(ω)
becomes independent of frequency. The value of real part of capacitance
at low frequencies is a measure of capacitance stored in the system. Figure 6b shows the change
in C″(ω) with frequency. C″(ω) attains a maximum at a frequency f0. The inverse of this frequency provides the dielectric
relaxation time constant (τo) for the whole system.
Nearly half of the low-frequency capacitance for the whole system
is attained at τo, and the value was found to be
4.64 s in this study. This parameter is also referred to as the supercapacitor
factor of merit.30

Electrochemical Performance Comparison for Electrodes Prepared
with Different Binders
The impact of binders on supercapacitor
performance has been discussed in this section. Herein, binders (Nafion,
PVDF, and PTFE) for electrode preparation were varied while the solvent
for OFG dispersion was EG and the electrodes were dried at 170 °C. Figure 7a shows the representative
CV curves at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 for electrodes
having different binders, and they were predominantly rectangular
in shape, where faradaic peaks were most pronounced for electrodes
prepared with the PVDF binder, followed by PTFE and Nafion. The specific
capacitance obtained from the CV curves followed the following trend:
PVDF > PTFE > Nafion (Table 3 and Figure 7a,b). Maximum specific capacitances obtained for PVDF, PTFE,
and
Nafion binders were 280, 260, and 240 F g–1, respectively.
Galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments also revealed a similar
trend (Figure S5 and Table S1), and the results obtained from these two electrochemical
techniques were in agreement with each other (Tables 3 and S1). Retentions
of specific capacitances with increasing scan rates of CV were similar
for different binders (Figure 7b). Figure 7c shows comparative Nyquist plots for the three binders. The vertical
rise in the low-frequency regime was steeper in the case of PVDF compared
to PTFE and Nafion, highlighting that PVDF shows a better capacitive
behavior. Ret values for PVDF, PTFE, and
Nafion were 0.4, 0.45, and 0.6 Ω, respectively, suggesting the
ease of electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface trend
as PVDF > PTFE > Nafion (Table 4).

EIS analysis further
suggests that pseudocapacitive charging (Qps) which represents electron transfer inside
the nanomaterial was faster for PVDF and the trend PVDF > PTFE
> Nafion
(Table 4). Knee frequencies
were 175, 67, and 121 Hz for PVDF, PTFE, and Nafion, respectively.
These values also suggest the ease of mass transport inside the nanomaterial
for electrodes prepared with the PVDF binder. The Bode plot demonstrates
that the slope for transition from a resistor (high-frequency region)
to a capacitor (low-frequency region) was shallow for PVDF compared
to those of PTFE and Nafion, presumably because of the enhanced faradaic
charge storage mechanism (Figure 7d). Furthermore, for the PVDF binder, in the low-frequency
region, phase angles continued to enhance toward a higher value which
is indicative of a good capacitive behavior (Figure 7d). On the other hand, in the cases of PTFE
and Nafion, phase angles slightly decrease after reaching a maximum
value in the low-frequency region which could be due to the dissolution
of the electrolyte ions or the unfavorable diffusion of ions (Figure 7d).13 This observation is also reflected by a decrease in Rdes for Nafion and PTFE presumably due to the
fact that lesser number of ions were adsorbed at the porous interface
as the resistance for the desorption of ions was lowered (Table 4). As a consequence,
the capacitance values also declined for PTFE and Nafion (Table 3).

Complex capacitance
studies showed that PVDF and PTFE had higher C′(ω)
values compared to Nafion and C′(ω)
values of PVDF dropped more sharply with
increasing frequency in comparison with PTFE (Figure 8a). The highest C′(ω)
obtained for the three different binders followed the following order:
PVDF > PTFE > Nafion (Figure 8a). These results imply that the electrodes with the
PVDF
binder were more capacitive in nature than those with PTFE and Nafion. Figure 8b displays C″(ω) versus frequency. τ0 values for Nafion, PVDF, and PTFE were 2.15, 3.84, and 1.77 s, respectively.
We speculate that a higher τ0 value for PVDF could
be due to the higher faradaic contribution which was observed in the
CV curves. Finally, all of these results suggest that the PVDF binder
could provide much better electrochemical performance compared to
Nafion or PTFE because it provides less resistance for electron transfer
at the electrode/electrolyte interface (Ret), higher knee frequency, higher pseudocapacitance (Qps), higher resistance for ion desorption (Rdes), and lower RC time constant (τRC) (Table 4). These
results are also in agreement with those of the SEM studies which
demonstrated the better stacking of graphene layers with the PVDF
binder which will allow the penetration of more electrolyte ions deep
inside the pores, improve electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte
interface, and facilitate pseudocapacitive charging. Besides, the
agglomeration of graphene layers in the cases of Nafion and PTFE presumably
imposed restriction on the percolation of the electrolyte ions inside
the pores. Differences in performances with different binders can
be rationalized by their properties. Nafion is known to be hydrophilic
in nature because of the presence of sulfonic acid groups (Figure S8a), whereas the basal plane of OFG is
hydrophobic. Hence, the interaction between OFG and Nafion is weak;
that is, binding affinity of Nafion with OFG was inferior. As a consequence,
agglomeration within the OFG sheets was severe (vide supra). It has
been previously reported that flat or wrinkled graphene sheets tend
to agglomerate during electrode preparation because of the strong
van der Waals attraction between parallel sheets and to achieve the
best performance of synthesized graphene, agglomeration should be
minimized.31 On the other hand, PVDF and
PTFE are hydrophobic in nature (Figures S8b,c), and hence the binding affinities of these two binders with OFG
were much better. Furthermore, these two binders are soluble in NMP
which resulted in fine dispersion during electrode preparation which
helped to minimize agglomeration. However, the solubility of PVDF
in NMP is higher in comparison to that of PTFE, and hence agglomeration
with the PVDF binder was less. Moreover, previous report suggests
that interfacial interaction between PVDF/PTFE and OFG can enhance
because of the hydrogen bonding between the fluorine atoms of the
binder and the hydroxyl functionalities of OFG and thus helped to
avoid agglomeration.32

Electrochemical Performance Comparison of Electrodes Prepared
from Different Solvents for OFG Dispersion
In this section,
solvents for OFG dispersion have been varied to understand the role
of the solvent in supercapacitor performance while PVDF was chosen
as a binder because it was found to be the best binder (vide supra).
The electrodes were dried at 170 °C, and two solvents used were
EG and NMP. The electrodes prepared from both solvents resulted in
rectangular CV curves, indicating fast double-layer charging/discharging,
and the hydroxyl functionalities resulted in small faradaic peaks
(Figure 9a). However,
the faradaic contribution was slightly higher for the electrodes prepared
from NMP compared to those prepared from EG. Specific capacitance
values obtained were higher for the electrodes prepared from the NMP
solvent than those of the electrodes prepared from of EG (Table 5). Maximum specific
capacitance was 318 F g–1 for NMP, whereas the value
was 280 F g–1 for EG. The results of galvanostatic
charge/discharge studies were in agreement with those of CV (Tables 5 and S2 and Figures 9a and S6). Retentions of
specific capacitance values with increasing scan rates of voltammetry
were 62 and 70% for NMP and EG, respectively (Table 5 and Figure 9b).

Figure 9c displays
the comparison of Nyquist plots for the two solvents. A vertical rise
at the low-frequency region parallel to the imaginary axis was higher
for the electrodes prepared from NMP, indicating a better capacitive
behavior. Ret was also low for NMP (0.3
Ω) compared with that for EG (0.4 Ω) (Table 6). Knee frequencies were 317
and 175 Hz for NMP and EG, respectively, suggesting that diffusion
occurred much faster for the electrodes prepared from the NMP solvent.
Transition from resistive to capacitive behavior was shallower for
the electrodes prepared from NMP, implying a more faradaic-type charge
storage phenomenon (Figure 9d). A higher phase angle of 81.2° was obtained in the
case of NMP compared with 79.2° in EG, highlighting better capacitive
performance for the electrodes prepared from the NMP solvent (Figure 9d). Equivalent circuit
fitting results suggested that pseudocapacitive charging (Qps) was faster for the electrodes prepared from
NMP while the resistance for the desorption of electrolyte ions (Rdes) was higher for NMP (Table 6). Furthermore, RC time constant (τRC) was also smaller for the electrodes prepared using the
NMP solvent compared to that for the electrodes prepared using EG
(Table 6).

Complex capacitance studies showed
that the value of C′(ω) was higher for
NMP compared to that for EG (Figure 10a). τ0 values were 3.84 and 4.64 s
for EG and NMP, respectively
(Figure 10b). A slightly
higher time constant for the electrodes prepared from NMP was presumably
due to the enhanced faradaic contribution.

vs frequency of OFG for the electrodes
prepared from two different solvents (EG and NMP) for OFG dispersion
with PVDF as a binder. The electrodes were dried at 170 °C.

In summary, electrochemical analysis
showed that the electrodes
prepared from the NMP solvent had higher specific capacitance because
of the faster diffusion of electrolyte ions inside the nanomaterial,
lower resistance for electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte
interface, smaller RC time constant, higher pseudocapacitive charging,
and higher resistance for ion desorption. These results firmly suggest
NMP as a better solvent for OFG dispersion compared to EG. SEM studies
indicated the better stacking of graphene layers for the electrodes
prepared from NMP compared to those prepared from EG (vide supra)
which helps more electrolyte ions to percolate inside the pores of
nanomaterials, and as a result, more double-layer capacitance and
a better faradaic contribution were obtained. A careful look at the
properties of these two solvents suggests that 10 times higher viscosity
of EG compared to NMP could be the possible reason for the observed
difference in electrochemical performances (Table S4) because all other properties of these two solvents are
similar. The solvent having lower viscosity helps in the uniform spreading
of active materials on the electrode surface which assists in efficient
evaporation of the solvent during electrode drying and results in
less agglomeration. This observation was supported by the SEM images
(vide supra), and the electrochemical results also demonstrated enhanced
redox peaks due to the hydroxyl functionalities for the electrodes
prepared from the NMP solvent compared to the electrodes prepared
from the EG solvent (Figure 9a). Indeed, these results suggest that the solvent for active
material dispersion plays a key role in supercapacitor performance.

Electrochemical Performance Comparison of Electrodes Prepared
at Different Drying Temperatures.
Earlier results suggested
PVDF as the best binder while NMP was a better solvent for OFG dispersion.
Hence, these two experimental conditions were chosen while the electrode-drying
temperatures (100, 170, and 190 °C) were varied because we speculated
that the rate of evaporation of solvent may significantly affect the
performance of a supercapacitor. Similar to the previous experiments,
CV curves were mostly rectangular but faradaic peaks were most prominent
wherein the electrodes were dried at 170 °C, followed by 100
and 190 °C (Figure 11a). The highest specific capacitance was maximum when the
electrodes were dried at 170 °C (318 F g–1 at
1 mV s–1, Table 7). The specific capacitance values followed the following
trend: 170 °C > 100 °C > 190 °C (Table 7). Specific capacitance retentions
with increasing
scan rates of voltammetry were similar at different experimental conditions
(Figure 11b and Table 7). Galvanostatic charge/discharge
experiments yielded similar results (Figure S7 and Table S3). The Nyquist plots demonstrated
that the vertical line at a low frequency parallel to the imaginary
component was steepest when the electrodes were dried at 170 °C,
highlighting a high capacitive behavior, and the decrease of slope
followed the following order: 170 °C > 100 °C > 190
°C
(Figure 11c). Electron-transfer
resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface (Ret) followed the following trend: 170 °C > 190
°C
> 100 °C (Table 8). Knee frequencies were 67, 317, and 82 Hz for 100, 170, and 190
°C drying temperatures, respectively, which highlights that the
diffusion process occurred fastest when the electrode-drying temperature
was 170 °C. The maximum phase angle obtained was highest when
the electrodes were dried at 170 °C (81.2°), and the following
trend was observed: 170 °C (81.2°) > 100 °C (79°)
> 190 °C (78.7°) (Figure 11d). These results suggest that the electrodes
dried
at 170 °C exhibited the best capacitive behavior in these series
of experiments.

EIS analysis further
suggested that the pseudocapacitive charging
was highest when the electrodes were dried at 170 °C and the
trend was 170 °C > 100 °C > 190 °C (Table 8). Furthermore, the
resistance
for the desorption of electrolyte ions (Rdes) was also highest and the RC time constant (τRC) was less at 170 °C drying temperature (Table 8). Complex capacitance studies demonstrated
that the highest value of C′(ω) followed
a similar trend as 170 °C > 100 °C > 190 °C,
which
indicates that the value of capacitance obtained must be comparatively
higher when the electrodes were dried at 170 °C (Figure 12a). The τ0 values were found to be 4.64, 10.0, and 8.25 s for 170, 100, and
190 °C, respectively (Figure 12b). The lowest dielectric relaxation time constant
and highest specific capacitance value for the electrodes prepared
at 170 °C drying temperature imply that this particular condition
has higher energy density as well as high power density which makes
it a suitable candidate for supercapacitor studies. In summary, it
can be concluded that indeed the electrode-drying temperature affects
the supercapacitor performance and herein 170 °C drying temperature
provides the best supercapacitor performance of OFG because of the
lower electron-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface,
higher pseudocapacitive charging, higher resistance for the desorption
of electrolyte ions, smaller RC time constant, and smaller dielectric
relaxation time constant. The SEM studies also indicated that the
stacking of graphene layers was best when the electrodes were dried
at 170 °C (vide supra). The role of electrode-drying temperature
in supercapacitor performance can be rationalized by noting that the
viscosity of the solvent decreases with increasing temperature; hence,
the electrodes dried at 170 °C will result in uniform spreading
of active materials on the electrode surface which assists in the
efficient evaporation of the solvent compared to the electrodes prepared
at the drying temperature of 100 °C; and hence, less agglomeration
was observed for the electrodes dried at 170 °C. This observation
was supported by the SEM images (vide supra) and enhanced redox response
due to the hydroxyl functionalities (Figure 11a). However, the electrochemical performance
significantly declined when the electrode was dried at 190 °C
because this temperature was close to the boiling point of NMP (202
°C). At 190 °C, the solvent started to boil, and because
of the rapid boiling of the solvent, OFG sheets agglomerated severely
because of the strong van der Waals interaction between graphene sheets.31 It is important to mention that boiling and
evaporation are significantly different processes. Evaporation is
a surface phenomenon and a slow process, whereas boiling is a bulk
phenomenon and the process is rapid. Finally, this study clearly shows
that the optimization of electrode-drying temperature is a crucial
parameter to improve the performance of a supercapacitor.

Figure 12 (a) C′(ω) vs frequency and (b) C″(ω) vs frequency of OFG for electrodes prepared
at different drying temperatures (100, 170, and 190 °C) with
NMP as a solvent for OFG dispersion and PVDF as a binder.

Conclusions
A series of experiments
for electrodes prepared using different
binders, solvents for OFG dispersion, and varying electrode-drying
temperatures have shown that all of these parameters affect the performance
of a supercapacitor. This study revealed that the best electrode preparation
methodology was PVDF as a binder, NMP as a solvent for OFG dispersion,
and 170 °C electrode-drying temperature wherein a maximum specific
capacitance of 318 F g–1 was achieved. On the other
hand, the electrodes prepared with Nafion as a binder, EG as a solvent
for OFG dispersion, and electrode-drying temperature of 170 °C
provided worst electrochemical performance wherein a maximum specific
capacitance of only 240 F g–1 was attained. The
SEM studies revealed that the stacking of graphene layers was significantly
improved while more edges were also exposed at the best electrode
preparation condition and the morphology of OFG on the electrode surface
was very similar to that of the as-synthesized material. Low viscosity
of the solvent and good solubility of the binder in the solvent helped
to achieve uniform dispersion of OFG on the electrode surface, and
hence the agglomeration of OFG sheets was avoided. A thorough electrochemical
analysis revealed that several physical parameters were impacted at
different electrode preparation conditions, attention on these parameters
is needed to extract the best performance from nanomaterials, and
they are as follows: (a) electron-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte
interface can be decreased, (b) pseudocapacitive charging can be improved,
(c) knee frequency can be increased which ensures the fast diffusion
of electrolyte ions inside the pores of nanomaterials, (d) resistance
for ion desorption can be increased, (e) RC time constant can be decreased,
and (f) dielectric relaxation time constant can be minimized which
represents half of the low-frequency capacitance for the whole system
and referred to as the supercapacitor factor of merit. Finally, we
hope that this work will bring attention in the scientific community
regarding electrode preparation methodology for supercapacitor applications
which has been overlooked till date. Furthermore, we speculate that
the physical parameters mentioned herein will be even more important
wherein pseudocapacitance is the predominant contributor toward the
specific capacitance.
