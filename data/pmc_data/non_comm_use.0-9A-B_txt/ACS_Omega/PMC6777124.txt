Syndiotactic polystyrene
(SPS) physical gels containing a large
amount of the ionic liquid 1-butylpyridinium bromide ([C4py]Br) were systematically prepared and their physical properties
were examined in detail. The gels had stable forms for a long time,
having storage elastic modulus values of normal gels. They showed
nearly the same values of the electrical conductivity (∼7 mS/cm)
as those of the mixed solutions of [C4py]Br, suggesting
that the distribution of [C4py]Br was uniform in these
gels and that the charge transportation in these SPS gels was not
interrupted by a three-dimensional network of SPS fibrils consisting
of the SPS δ crystalline phases.

Introduction
Syndiotactic polystyrene
(SPS), which is a useful heat-resistant
engineering plastic material with high workability, was first synthesized
in 1986 by using a metallocene catalyst.1 SPS is known to have complex polymorphic behavior2−4 and forms physical
gels when dissolved in some organic compounds.5 Thermoreversible gels of SPS have been extensively studied so far
since Kobayashi et al.6 Finally, SPS gels
are established to have a three-dimensional network of fibrils consisting
of the δ crystalline phases such as a δ clathrate phase7,8 or a δ intercalate phase.9−11 If all of the solvent
molecules are evacuated from SPS gels, the X-ray diffraction peaks
of the SPS samples are identical to those of SPS δ empty crystalline
phase,12 which is monoclinic (space group P21/a; a =
1.74 nm; b = 1.18 nm; c = 0.78 nm;
γ = 117°) and exhibits per unit cell 2 identical cavities
centered on the center of symmetry and bounded by 10 phenyl rings.12,13 Previously, we examined where more than 60 solvent compounds could
form SPS gels.14−16 Finally, it was concluded that the formation of SPS
thermoreversible gels was strongly dependent on the molecular volume
of the solvent and compatibility between SPS and the solvent and that
there is a “gelation range” of solvent molecules as
for molecular volume size and solubility parameter.

An ionic
liquid (IL) is defined as a salt whose melting temperature
is, at most, 100 °C. Because it has unique properties, such as
nonflammability, negligible volatility, wide electrochemical window,
and high ionic conductivity, the application of ILs has become a topic
of advanced research.17−21 If SPS gels containing a large fraction of ILs can be prepared,
they would be a useful soft material for batteries and sensors.

The first trial in obtaining SPS gels containing ILs was carried
out using partially sulfonated SPS.22 The
gels could include 30 wt % of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide,
an IL, but this did not show any electric conductivity. In 2017, Jana
et al. reported that the membranes made of SPS aerogel with a thickness
of ∼100 μm were swollen with 1-n-butyl-methylpyrrolidinium
bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide, an IL, and that the ionic conductivity
of the membrane was found to be 6.33 × 10–4 S/cm.23

In the present paper, we
show our method of preparing SPS gels
having a large amount of IL that are perfectly in gel form and electrically
conductive.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of SPS Gels Containing ILs
We have already
examined the structure and properties of SPS/pyridine (Py) gels.16 Taking into account good compatibility between
SPS and Py, we tried to produce SPS gels containing ILs having a pyridinium
ring. The thermogravimetry (TG) plots showed that the temperatures
where the thermal decomposition process of 1-butyl-4-methylpyridinium
tetrafluoroborate and 1-butylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
occurred happened to overlap with the temperatures where SPS decomposition
occurred, which started above 320 °C. However, the thermal decomposition
of 1-butylpyridinium bromide ([C4py]Br) started above 200
°C and ended below 300 °C. Therefore, we realized that we
could determine the fractions of SPS, [C4py]Br, and solvent
in SPS gels from the TG plots of the gels. Thus, we chose [C4py]Br for the purpose of producing SPS gels containing a plenty of
IL. [C4py]Br whose melting point was 95 °C can easily
be liquefied by its exposure to the open air for long time periods
because it is hygroscopic. However, the addition of 1 wt % water into
[C4py]Br was found to give the stable liquid state. Thus,
we used a mixture of [C4py]Br with 1 wt % water. Hereafter,
we call this solution to be ILBr.

Before finding the better
preparation conditions of SPS gels containing ILBr, we tried the following
experiments step-by-step. First, we tried to directly dissolve SPS
pellets in ILBr at high temperatures, but this ended in failure. Thus,
we chose some solvents able to form SPS physical gels and tried to
mix ILBr in them. The solvents used included chloroform, Py, toluene,
tetrahydrofuran (THF), piperidine, and pyrrolidine. ILBr was insoluble
with toluene, THF, and piperidine even at high temperatures. Only
less than 10 wt % of ILBr was found to be soluble in these. Although
ILBr was slightly soluble in chloroform, SPS did not dissolve in a
mixture of ILBr and chloroform. Finally, ILBr was found to be mixed
at any ratio with Py and pyrrolidine at room temperature.24 Then, we dissolved SPS in Py and pyrrolidine-containing
ILBr at high temperatures and successfully obtained SPS gels by cooling
at room temperature. For example, 5 wt % SPS gels were formed with
Py with 10 wt % of ILBr or with pyrrolidine with 20 wt % of ILBr.

Now that SPS gels containing an IL were formed, their structures
were examined by the wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements
(Figure 1). The fibrils
of SPS/Py gels were reported to be of SPS/Py δ intercalate phase10,11 [the typical reflection peaks are at 2θ = 5.7° (010)
and 10.3° (200)] when the gels were wet;16 however, by drying SPS/Py gels at 40 °C for 24 h under vacuum,
they changed to SPS δ empty phase [2θ = 8.6° (010)
and 10.4° (2̅10)]12 because
of the desorption of Py molecules.

Figure 1 WAXD profiles of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels [Py: [C4py]Br = 9:1 (weight ratio)] (1–3)
and SPS/Py gels (4, 5).
SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels; (1) wet gel, (2) just after drying
under vacuum, (3) dried powder after washing with methanol. SPS/Py
gels; (4) wet gel, (5) powder gel after drying under vacuum.

The wet gels made of 5 wt % SPS with Py containing
10 wt % of [C4py]Br showed the same WAXD profiles as 5
wt % SPS/Py wet gels,
meaning that the fibrils forming a three-dimensional network were
the SPS δ intercalate phase. We dried this SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gel at 40 °C for 24 h under vacuum and found a reflection
peak at 2θ = 8.3° corresponding to the 010 with the SPS
δ monoclinic phase having guest molecules.7,8 In
the case of SPS/Py gel, all of the guest Py molecules were desorbed
after drying under vacuum and the crystalline phase changed to SPS
δ empty phase. Therefore, there is a possibility that [C4py]Br can be a guest molecule inside the cavity of the SPS
nanoporous δ phase because the cation part of [C4py]Br is 9.59 Å × 4.99 Å × 1.82 Å (87.1
Å3)25 and the cavity volume
of SPS δ empty phase is 120–160 Å3. When
the SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels were dried under vacuum, [C4py]Br remained as the liquid state without being evaporated.
Therefore, we washed out [C4py]Br with methanol from the
dried gels. Along with washing, the reflection peak at 2θ =
8.3 turned out to be shifted to 8.7°. In fact, there are two
nanoporous-crystalline δ phases, the monoclinic one with typical
2θ = 8.3°–8.4° as well as a triclinic one with
2θ = 8.7°.26 Thus, the change
of the WAXD profiles before and after extraction with methanol could
be the transformation from the nanoporous-crystalline monoclinic δ
phase toward the triclinic one. In any way, the fibrils forming a
three-dimensional network in SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gel was established
to be of the SPS nanoporous-crystalline δ phases. Figure S1 shows the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) pictures of SPS fibrils.

So far, it can be concluded that
(1) the shape of SPS gels containing
[C4py]Br is kept to be stable due to the three-dimensional
network of SPS fibrils whose structure is of SPS/Py δ intercalate
phase and (2) the fibril structure is not destroyed even by evaporation
of Py under vacuum and by direct surrounding of ILBr because the structure
of SPS fibrils is maintained by the formation of SPS δ clathrate
phase with either Py or [C4py]Br as a guest. Thus, we can
expect that the contact of [C4py]Br with SPS/Py gels would
increase the fraction of [C4py]Br in SPS gels without getting
collapsed.

Therefore, we carried out the following experiments.
First, we
prepared 1.2 g SPS gels with mixed solvents of Py and ILBr, with a
weight ratio of Py/ILBr = 9:1 in screw tubes. Second, we mounted 0.6
g of ILBr or Py solutions of ILBr as shown in Figure S2, with different ratios on the SPS/Py/ILBr gels and
left them at 25 °C for 1 week. The concentration of SPS was of
5 wt %.

The SPS gels kept the same shapes as those in the initial
stage
even after the mount of ILBr for 1 week. The WAXD charts of all SPS
gels after mounting ILBr or ILBr solutions show that the fibril structure
of the gels was still made with SPS δ intercalate crystalline
phase. We measured TG/differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the SPS
gel part (Figure S2). In these wet gels,
each fraction of SPS, Py, and [C4py]Br was calculated because
the plateau regions were observed.27 The
fractions of [C4py]Br against all solvents in the SPS gels
were 16, 21, and 46 wt %, respectively, when the mounting solvents
were 20, 50, and 100 wt % of ILBr. These values were found to be nearly
the same of the fractions of [C4py]Br in all of the mixed
solvents (13, 24, and 41%) calculated when all [C4py]Br
molecules were uniformly distributed in the SPS gel and the liquid
that was mounted on the gel. Although the contact area of the interface
between the gel and liquid is not wide, all of the solvent molecules
appear to be mixed and reach the equilibrium state, where each solvent
is uniformly distributed. This means that the interface of SPS/Py
gels does not interrupt [C4py]Br from entering the SPS
gel part and that the gel network composed of the SPS δ crystalline
phase is so stable that the gel shape should be maintained. Thus,
we understand that the immersion of SPS/Py gels in ILBr would be a
good way of increasing the fraction of [C4py]Br in the
gels.

Finally, we have established the preparation way of SPS
gels where
the weight ratio of [C4py]Br is 80 wt % or more. The preparation
way can be summarized as follows: first, SPS was dissolved in Py at
high temperatures such as 140 °C and cooled at room temperature.
The gel samples for the measurements of viscoelasticity and electrical
conductivity were prepared by casting the Py solutions of SPS into
each regular mold after cooling the solution around 120 °C. After
keeping the gels at room temperature for 1 day, the gels were immersed
in ILBr or Py solutions of ILBr. We obtained SPS gels containing various
concentrations of [C4py]Br by changing the immersion time
or the composition of ILBr in the liquid that SPS gels were immersed
in. The fraction of [C4py]Br in an SPS gel was measured
with TG/DTA. Though SPS/Py gels were slightly opaque at 5 wt % SPS,
the color of the gels turned brown after immersion in ILBr.

Viscoelastic
Properties of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br Gels
Now that the
SPS gels with high fractions of an IL compound were
prepared with ease, we studied their physical properties, such as
viscoelasticity and electrical conductivity. To evaluate the viscoelastic
properties of the SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels, dynamic frequency
rheological measurements were carried out using a rheometer. Figure 2 shows the frequency
dependence of the storage elastic modulus, G′,
for SPS/Py/[C4py]Br and SPS/Py. Each gel was 5 wt % of
SPS. The results are summarized as follows: (i) The G′ value of each gel increased with an increase of frequency,
but the frequency dependence of the SPS gels containing [C4py]Br was less than that of the SPS/Py gel without [C4py]Br. (ii) The reproducibility was so high that the inside of the
gels was assumed to be uniform (the G′ values
of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels containing 35 and 41 wt % of [C4py]Br were nearly the same at each frequency as shown in Figure 2). (iii) The G′ values of SPS gels containing ∼40 wt %
[C4py]Br were found to be tens of thousands Pascal, indicating
that the SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels had enough mechanical strength
to keep stable shapes. Thus, our SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels are
expected to utilize as good soft materials. For example, the values
are similar to the ionogel prepared with gelator and poly(methyl methacrylate).28 Thus, it is ascertained that we have succeeded
in preparing stable gels with a large amount of IL only by using inherent
SPS, namely, without being chemically modified and without adding
any reagents such as gelators.

Figure 2 Viscoelastic properties of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br [the fractions
of [C4py]Br were 35 (black circle) and 41 wt % (red square)
and SPS/Py gels (blue triangle)] at 25 °C: the SPS concentrations
of all of the gels were 5 wt %.

Guenet et al. observed that the loss elastic modulus, G″, became larger than G′ at much lower
frequencies, when fibril–fibril interaction in a gel was not
strong enough so that there was a phenomenon of junction modification
by chain slipping under stress.29,30 We expected that the
large fraction of ILs might weaken the interaction between SPS fibrils.
However, the frequency dependence of G″ (Figure S3) did not show the change Guenet et
al. observed. The junction of fibril networks in SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gel was found to be unchanged by the addition of a large amount
of [C4py]Br.

Electrical Conductivity of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br Gels
Last, we examined the electrical conductivity
of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels by changing the fraction of [C4py]Br
and SPS. We used a low resistivity meter. To keep the same conditions
for the measurements of conductivity, all of the gels were prepared
in the same template made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). We obtained
each fraction of SPS, Py, and [C4py]Br in a gel from the
TG chart of the SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gel (Figure 3). The fractions of an SPS gel were expressed
to be as (w, x, y; z) where w, x, and y are the wt % of [C4py]Br, Py,
and SPS in a gel, and z is the fraction (wt %) of
[C4py]Br in the total solvents, that is, [C4py]Br and Py. For example, the fractions calculated from line 3 of Figure 3 are (79.2, 17.3,
3.46; 82.0), where the fraction of [C4py]Br in the solvents
of the gel, that is, z, was obtained by 79.2/(79.2
+ 17.3) × 100 (=82.0 wt %).

Figure 3 TG traces of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br
gels at a scan rate of
10 °C/min: (1) SPS pellet, (2) ILBr, and (3–6) SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels (5 wt % of SPS) with different fractions of [C4py]Br (see the definition of (w, x, y; z) in the text).
(3) (79.2, 17.3, 3.46; 82.0), (4) (62.1, 33.6, 4.21; 64.9), (5) (52.6,
42.3, 5.03; 55.4), (6) (45.6, 49.5, 4.94; 47.9).

In Figure 4, the
electrical conductivity of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gel (SPS, 5
wt %) was plotted as a red circle against the fraction of [C4py]Br in all of the solvents inside the gel. Needless to say, the
electrical conductivity of SPS/Py gel was not measurable due to its
high resistivity. However, all SPS gels containing [C4py]Br
were found to be electrically conductive, as shown in Figure 4. The highest value of conductivity
observed in Figure 4 was 7.4 mS/cm for SPS/Py/[C4py]Br where [C4py]Br was 48 wt % in the gel. The conductivity was around 7 mS/cm
at ∼40 wt % of [C4py]Br in the solvents of the SPS
gel, which is nearly the same as the SPS gel whose G′ value was tens of thousands Pascal (Figure 2). Thus, our SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels
are concluded to be not only stable but also conductive.

Figure 4 Electrical
conductivity of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels (red
circle) and SPS/Py gels (blue triangle), solutions of Py and [C4py]Br (black square) at a fraction value of [C4py]Br/([C4py]Br + Py).

Figure 4 demonstrates
that the SPS gel containing 79 wt % [C4py]Br had a lower
conductivity than the gel containing a lower fraction of [C4py]Br. As a matter of fact, the conductivity of [C4py]Br
without Py was 3 μS/cm.31 To obtain
the electrical conductivity of the mixed solutions between Py and
[C4py]Br,32 we used an electrode
as the conductivity sensor (black square of Figure 4). As it is already known,17−21 the conductivity of the solution with ILs tends to
increase compared with that of the inherent IL itself. In the case
of [C4py]Br and Py, the mixture of 60 wt % [C4py]Br turned out to show the highest conductivity (∼7 mS/cm).
The measurement methods were different between the SPS gels and the
mixed solvents, but the values of electrical conductivity appear to
be nearly the same. Note that the conductivity values of the SPS gels
and the mixed solvents were nearly the same at the same composition
of [C4py]Br. The conductivity values of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels whose fractions of [C4py]Br in the solvents,
that is, [C4py]Br and Py, were 45–65 wt % were found
to be around 7 mS/cm, which was almost identical to that of the solutions.

In addition, we measured the conductivity of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br with 9.1 wt % of SPS ([C4py]Br 60%, Py 31%) [[C4py]Br/([C4py]Br + Py) = 66%] to be 7.1 mS/cm, which
was identical to that of the 5 wt % SPS gel. From the standpoint of
conductivity, it follows from these results that (1) the distribution
of the IL ([C4py]Br) is uniform in the SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels and (2) the charge transportation in these SPS gels is
not interrupted by the three-dimensional network of SPS fibrils. SPS
is a typical electrically insulating material, but the existence of
SPS fibrils in the gels does not prevent the solvent molecules from
diffusing in the area where solvent molecules gather together. This
result is consistent with our studies on the molecular motion in SPS
gels using fluorescent probe molecules.33

Moreover, we kept this gel sample (SPS 9.1 wt %) for half
year
in a screw tube. Syneresis of Py did not occur and the size did not
change, while a little syneresis was observed for an SPS/Py gel with
10 wt % SPS.

In conclusion, we prepared SPS gels containing
high concentrations
of [C4py]Br by the immersion of SPS/Py gels in [C4py]Br. Some ionogels reported are so stiff that the G′ values were over 100 kPa, but our gels have relatively low G′ values. Moreover, the electrical conductivity
was as high as 7 mS/cm. Thus, we can conclude that we developed an
efficient soft material with a stable shape and high conductivity.

Experimental Section
Materials
SPS was kindly supplied
by Idemitsu Kosan
Co., Ltd. It is 98% syndiotactic with an Mw of 152 000, and an Mw/Mn of 1.9. SPS was dissolved with a solvent in
a screw tube by heating the mixture at high temperature after influx
of dry nitrogen gas for 1 min. The solvents used included chloroform,
Py, toluene, THF (Wako Co.), piperidine, and pyrrolidine (Sigma-Aldrich).
The ILs used were 1-butylpyridinium bromide ([C4py]Br)
(Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo Kasei), 1-butyl-4-methylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 1-butylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(Tokyo Kasei). All of the ILs and solvents were used without purification.
The heating temperature of a sample was sometimes higher than the
boiling temperature of the solvent by 10–20 °C. In the
case of SPS/Py gels and SPS/pyrrolidine gels with 5–10 wt %
SPS, the heating temperatures were 130–140 and 120–130
°C, respectively. After SPS was perfectly dissolved, the solutions
were well stirred by using a vortex mixer, heated again for 2 min,
and finally cooled at room temperature (around 25 °C) for 1 day.

Measurements
WAXD patterns were measured at room temperature
using a Rigaku MicroMax 7 HFM with a beam of Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15418 nm) that was finely focused by a confocal mirror
and collimator. SPS wet gels and dried powders measured for the WAXD
were filled in a capillary made of soda lime glass with a diameter
of 1.0 mm (Hilgenberg GmbH). The diffraction patterns were detected
by a Rigaku R-Axis IV++ and recorded on an imaging plate. The data
were analyzed by using FIT2D program. Diffraction intensities at constant
2θ shown in a diffraction pattern were obtained by the integration
of all diffraction intensities around the beam.

The TG/DTA data
of SPS gels, which were filled in platinum pans, were obtained using
a Rigaku Thermo Plus EVO2 TG/DTA 81205Z instrument in air while increasing
the temperature from 15 to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. Gels for the dynamic
frequency rheological measurements were prepared in a PTFE bottle
whose inner diameter was 25 mm. SPS/Py solutions with 5 wt % SPS (around
120 °C) were poured to the vessel and cooled at room temperature.
The height of the gels was arranged to be 1 cm. The fraction of [C4py]Br in the SPS gels for this purpose was increased by the
mount of ILBr, that is, a mixture of [C4py]Br with 1 wt
% water, on the gel in the vessel. The measurements were carried out
with an ARES G-2 rheometer (TA Instruments) whose stage for samples
had a diameter of 2.5 cm.

SEM pictures were obtained using a
JEOL JSM-6300 or JEOL JSM-6510LV
after drying an SPS/Py gel on a glass plate under vacuum at 40 °C
for more than 2 days. Dried SPS samples were stuck on a double-sided
tape of carbon and coated with platinum. In the case of SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gels, the same method did not give the clear SEM pictures
of SPS networks due to the disturbance of [C4py]Br. Thus,
we washed the dried SPS/Py/[C4py]Br gel with methanol and
dried the gel powder.

We used a low resistivity meter (Loresta-GX
MCP-T700, Mitsubishi
Chemical Analytech) with a 4-pin probe (ASP probe). We obtained values
of electrical conductivity of our SPS gels by measuring their surface
resistivity and by using calculation software of the machine, where
we inputted each size of our gels (length, breadth, and height). To
keep the same conditions for the measurements of conductivity, all
of the gels were prepared in the same template made of PTFE: the sizes
were 1 cm × 5 cm × 0.5 cm (depth). Moreover, we obtained
the electrical conductivity of the mixed solutions between Py and
[C4py]Br, and we used a Conducell 4USF-PG 120 conductivity
sensor (Hamilton) connected to a Stratos Eco 2405 Cond converter (Knick).

The fraction of water
was not determined
by our TG/DTA charts because of the small amount of water added and
the strong interaction between pyridine and water.

To be exact, this conductivity
was measured
for ILBr, which included 1 wt % of water.


We prepared the solutions of Py and [C4py]Br by mixing Py and ILBr, which contained 1 wt % of water.
DTA measurements at a scan rate of 10 °C/min did not show any
peak of water, although the sharp peak due to [C4py]Br
appeared around 104 °C. Thus, we judged that water molecules
had strong interaction with Py molecules so that their roles were
involved in the Py phases.
