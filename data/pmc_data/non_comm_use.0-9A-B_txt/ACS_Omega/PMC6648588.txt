Anisotropy and depolarization are
two interconvertible parameters
in fluorescence and light scattering spectroscopy that describe the
polarization distribution of emitted and scattered photons generated
with linearly polarized excitation light. Whereas anisotropy is more
frequently used in fluorescence literature for studying association/dissociation
of fluorophore-bearing reagents, depolarization is more popular in
the light-scattering literature for investigating the effect of scatterers’
geometries and chemical compositions. Presented herein is a combined
computational and experimental study of the scattering and fluorescence
depolarization enhancement induced by light scattering in turbid samples.
The most important finding is that sample light scattering and fluorescence
depolarization increases linearly with sample light-scattering extinction.
Therefore, one can extrapolate the analyte-specific scattering and
fluorescence depolarization through linear curve fitting of the sample
light scattering and fluorescence depolarization as a function of
the sample concentration or the path length of the sampling cuvettes.
An example application of this linear extrapolation method is demonstrated
for quantifying the fluorophore-specific fluorescence depolarization
and consequently its anisotropy for an aggregation-induced-emission
sample. This work should be important for a wide range of macromolecular,
supramolecular, and nanoscale fluorescent materials that are often
strong light scatterers due to their large sizes.

Introduction
Fluorescence and light
scattering anisotropy or depolarization
is a measurement of the polarization distribution of the fluorescence
emission and scattered photons excited with linearly polarized light.
Although the anisotropy spectrum r(λ) and depolarization P(λ) are two interconvertible parameters as shown
with eqs 1 and 2, their popularity differs in fluorescence and light-scattering
literature works. Anisotropy is more popular in fluorescence spectroscopy
literature,1−12 whereas depolarization is more commonly used in the light scattering
literature.13,14 Experimentally, fluorescence
anisotropy or depolarization is measured by exciting the fluorophores
with vertically linearly polarized light (V) and then detecting the
intensity of Stokes’ shifted emission that is vertically (IVV(λ)) and horizontally polarized (IVH(λ)). The variable G(λ) in eqs 1 and 2 is for correcting the polarization bias in the instrument
response, and it is commonly referred to as G-factor
or G-factor spectrum.15 1   2  The quantification
of a material-scattering
depolarization spectrum is achieved with the recent polarized resonance
synchronous spectroscopic (PRS2) method.16 In this case, IVH and IVV intensities used in eq 2 are the PRS2 intensity obtained by setting the detection
polarization in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively.
Again, the first letter in the subscripts of IVH and IVV refers to the linear
polarization of the excitation photon and the second is the polarization
of the detected photons. The excitation and detection wavelengths
are kept identical and they simultaneously change in the PRS2 spectral
acquisitions. Although quantification of the material light-scattering
depolarization spectrum for samples that are pure scatterers and simultaneous
photon absorbers and scatterers is straightforward with this PRS2
method, caution should be exercised for fluorescent samples that are
simultaneously photon absorbers, scatterers, and emitters.16,17 For these samples, one must reliably separate material on-resonance
fluorescence, the fluorescence emission at the same wavelength with
the excitation photons, from the light scattering.17

Although fluorescence and light scattering depolarization
share
the same mathematical forms, they differ significantly in origin,
magnitude, and information content. Fluorescence anisotropy is a function
of the fluorophore fluorescence lifetime, angle between fluorophore
excitation and emission dipoles, and rotational mobility in solutions.15 Due to relatively long fluorescence lifetime
of common fluorescent materials, fluorescence depolarization of small
fluorophores in solutions is usually close to unity, i.e., the total
randomization of the emission polarization. Fluorescence depolarization
occurs as long as the rotational diffusion rate of fluorophore in
solutions is comparable to or faster than the fluorophore emission
lifetime time scale. Events increasing the hydrodynamic radius of
the fluorophore-bearing molecules reduces their rotational frequency,
decreasing the fluorescence depolarization and increase the fluorescence
anisotropy. As such, fluorescence anisotropy has been an effective
tool for studying the antibody/antigen binding, dye self-assembly
and inclusion, supramolecular formation, and biomaterial–nanoparticle
interfacial interactions.1−12

In contrast, light scattering occurs instantaneously upon
photon
excitation (within femtosecond time scale): scatterers are essentially
immobile in solutions during individual photon excitation and scattering
cycles. The degree of the light-scattering depolarization depends
solely on the scatterers’ geometries and their chemical compositions.13,14,16,18 As an example, the light-scattering depolarization spectrum of linear
solvent molecule CS2 is 0.5 crossing the entire UV–vis
region whereas depolarization of the tetrahedral CCl4 is
essentially zero (below the limit of detection of 0.02).14 Light-scattering depolarization has enabled
in situ and nondestructive monitoring of the structural modification
of plasmonic gold nanoparticle aggregation and porphyrin self-assembly.13,18

Whereas quantification of the sample light scattering and
fluorescence
depolarization is straightforward, reliable determination of the intrinsic
analyte-specific fluorescence and scattering depolarization in turbid
samples is challenging. This difficulty arises from the depolarization
propagation occurring from the multiplicative light scattering and
the interplay of light-scattering and fluorescence emission depolarizations.
Taking fluorescence depolarization measurement as an example, light
scattering can enhance the sample fluorescence depolarization through
depolarizing the excitation photons and additional depolarizing of
the emitted photons. As it will be shown later in this work, such
depolarization enhancement occurs even when the intrinsic scattering
depolarization of the scatterers in the sample is zero.

The
complication of fluorescence anisotropy by sample light scattering
has been long recognized.19,20 There are extensive
theoretical and experimental works on how multiplicative scattering
affects the sample photon absorption, scattering, and fluorescence
anisotropy.21−28 Many of these methods involve complex mathematical models and/or
lengthy data acquisitions and analysis procedures. One operationally
relatively simple approach to alleviate the complication of the external
light-scattering depolarization in fluorescence anisotropy measurement
is to use a cuvette of small path lengths (e.g., 3 mm × 3 mm
square cuvette instead of the conventional 10 mm × 10 mm) to
reduce the excitation and detection path lengths.29,30 In this case, the sample fluorescence anisotropy determined with
the small cuvette is approximated as the fluorophore-specific fluorescence
anisotropy.29,30 Imaginably, the accuracy of this
approximation depends on the cuvette size, the sample turbidity, as
well as the intrinsic light scattering and fluorescence depolarization
of the analytes in the sample. It would be ideal if one can extrapolate
the sample light scattering and fluorescence anisotropy until sample
light scattering extinction is zero. In this case, the sample light
scattering and fluorescence anisotropy are equivalent to the analyte-specific
scattering and fluorescence anisotropy.

Governed by this hypothesis,
we reported herein a combined computational
and experimental investigation of the effect of multiplicative light
scattering on the light scattering and fluorescence depolarization
of solution samples. One of the most important findings is that the
sample light scattering and fluorescence depolarization but not their
anisotropy increase linearly with the sample scattering extinction
intensity. The analyte-specific scattering depolarization and fluorescence
depolarization can be readily linearly extrapolated by the linear
curve-fitting of the sample light scattering or fluorescence depolarization
as a function of the analyte light scattering extinction or the cuvette
path length in the scattering and fluorescence depolarization measurements.
Therefore, it is operationally much more convenient to first quantify
the analyte-specific light scattering and fluorescence depolarizations
and subsequently convert the depolarization into anisotropy if needed.
Validation of this linear extrapolation method is performed with fluorescent
polystyrene nanoparticles (fPSNPs) that are simultaneous photon absorbers,
scatterers, and fluorescent emitters. An example application of this
technique is demonstrated using the emission-induced emission of 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethylene
(TPE).

Results and Discussion
Effect of Multiplicative Scattering on Light
Depolarization
Effect of multiplicative scattering on light
depolarization is
demonstrated with polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) with a diameter
of 0.1 μm. PSNP is a pure light scatterer in the wavelength
region from 300 to 800 nm.16 Therefore,
PSNP UV–vis extinction spectrum is its scattering extinction
spectrum. Whereas UV–vis intensity of the PSNP linearly increases
with the PNSP concentration following the Beer–Lambert Law
(Figure 1A), the experimental
PSNP PRS2 VH signal increases nonlinearly with the PSNP concentration.
It increases faster than one would expect from a linear dependence
of light-scattering intensity as a function of scatterer’s
concentration (Figure 1B,C). Since the PRS2 VH detects only scattered photons with a polarization
direction 90° perpendicular to the polarization direction of
the excitation light, the rapid increase of the VH signal as a function
of the PSNP concentration indicates that the PSNP sample light-scattering
depolarization increases with the PSNP concentration or the sample
light-scattering extinction. Otherwise, the PSNP VH signal could only
linearly increase with increasing PSNP concentration in the case that
light scattering imposes no significant sample inner filter effect
(IFE) on the detected light-scattering intensity or increases slower
than the scatterer’s concentration when the sample IFE by light
scattering is strong.

(black) intercept from the linear curve fitting in (E) as a function

modeling was performed by assuming the samples are pure light scatterers
with no significant photon absorption and emission.

Recent work has shown light scattering and absorption
extinction
differ drastically in their sample IFE in fluorescence measurements.31 Significant IFE occurs with the sample photon
absorption extinction as low as 0.05, but no detectable IFE is observed
when the sample light-scattering extinction is as high as 1. The fact
that PSNP VH signal increases faster than the PSNP concentration strongly
indicates that light-scattering extinction has no significant IFE
on the light-scattering intensity measurements. In contrast, the sample
photon absorption extinction invariably reduces sample light-scattering
intensity through its IFE.31

It is
currently impossible to experimentally quantify the depolarization
enhancements induced by the sample multiplicative light scattering.
Evaluation of the sample light-scattering depolarization requires
determination of the sample PRS2 VV and VH signal. However, the PRS2
VV intensity of a PSNP sample is drastically higher than its PRS2
VH signal, because the intrinsic PSNP light-scattering depolarization
is negligibly small, leaving most scattered light in the vertical
polarization under the vertically polarized light excitation. The
PRS2 VV signal of a PSNP sample with scattering extinction as low
as 0.002 surpasses the saturation threshold, which is about 2 000 000
counts of the Fluoromax-4 instrument. As such, the light-scattering
depolarization enhancement due to multiplicative light scattering
is not a concern in practice in our current light-scattering depolarization
measurements.31 However, in fluorescence
measurements, the sample light-scattering extinction can be readily
higher than 0.02, the threshold value for significant derivation to
occur in the PSNP PRS2 VH signal as a function of its concentration
(Figure 1B). Since
light-scattering depolarization and fluorescence depolarization are
intertwined, understanding how multiplicative light scattering enhances
sample scattering depolarization is critical for reliable quantification
of the analyte-specific fluorescence depolarization in turbid samples.

The mechanistic diagram (Figure 1D) illustrates how multiplicative light scattering
enhances sample light-scattering depolarization. In this diagram and
the subsequent simulations shown in Figure 1E–G, the intrinsic scattering depolarization
is assumed to be zero, i.e., there is no detectable PRS2 VH signal
if no multiplicative scattering event occurs. For a linearly polarized
incident photon propagating in direction K0 with an electric field (polarization) in E0 direction, the electric vector E0 will be rotated to ES when the photon
is scattered into direction KS. Therefore,
the vertical electric field of the polarized photons will be randomized
after experiencing a secondary or higher order of multiplicative scattering,
resulting in loss of polarization due to the additive property of
depolarization. Figure 2E simulates PRS2 intensities of a pure scatterer with intrinsic zero
depolarization as sample scattering extinction increases. This validates
the trend that PRS2 VV intensity increases slower than scattering
extinction, which was not observable with measurement, and the increase
of PRS2 VH intensity agrees with the experimental observation in the
previous section.

(M) and (N) are obtained by extrapolating the intercepts of sample
depolarization as a function of excitation scattering extinction for
every emission wavelength. The error bars represent the fitting errors
of the intercepts from the linear curve fitting. Y values in (O) and (P) are average sample depolarizations of different
concentrations and the error bar represents standard deviations.

Computational simulation revealed
that empirically, the sample
light-scattering depolarization increases linearly with the sample
light-scattering extinction and the intercept is the scatterer’s
intrinsic scattering depolarization (Figure 1F–H). This finding is important: it
provides a simple way for one to linearly extrapolate the intrinsic
light-scattering depolarization through the sample dilutions or measurements
with a series of cuvettes differing in the path lengths. In contrast,
light-scattering anisotropy is nonlinearly dependent on the sample
light-scattering extinction (Figure S1,
Supporting Information), making such extrapolation difficult. Therefore,
it is operationally easier to calculate the analyte-specific light
scattering depolarization than its scattering anisotropy.

Extrapolating
Analyte-Specific Fluorescence Depolarization through
Sample Dilution
fPSNP is a commercial composite nanoparticle
containing two fluorophores, rhodamine and alexa 532, in a polystyrene
matrix. There are two considerations in choosing fPSNP as a model
for studying the effect of multiplicative scattering on fluorescence
depolarization. First, fPSNP itself is a simultaneous scatterer, absorber,
and emitter. Its UV–vis extinction cross section spectrum is
decomposed into its absorption and scattering component spectra (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Furthermore,
fPSNP has no significant light-scattering depolarization,16 which enables us to compare our experimental
data with the computational results of the zero analyte-specific light
scattering depolarization. Second, the highest fPSNP concentration
used in the experimental study is 2.01 nM (Figure 2B), which is sufficiently low to avoid any
significant fPSNP aggregation. Furthermore, as photon scattering and
emission occur by the same analyte (fPSNPs in this study), the possibility
of concentration-dependent scatterers/emitters interactions is excluded.
Therefore, the fluorescence depolarization variations as a function
of fPSNP concentration must be due exclusively to the multiplicative
light scattering effect. In contrast, several previous works used
mixtures of photon emitters and scatterers to investigate the effect
of light scattering on fluorescence anisotropy measurements.23,24,28 In these cases, possible concentration-dependent
scatterer/scatterer, scatterer/emitter, and emitter/emitter interactions
can also introduce variations in the sample fluorescence anisotropy,
complicating the data analysis.

Using the recent PRS2 technique,16 we decomposed the UV–vis extinction spectra
(Figure S2, Supporting Information) obtained
with the fPSNP samples into its scattering and absorption extinction
spectra (Figure 2A–D).
The four dashed lines in Figure 2B–D are the excitation wavelengths (365, 400,
470, and 500 nm from left to right) used for the fluorescence depolarization
measurements shown in Figure 2E–H.

The fluorescence depolarization of the fPSNP
samples obtained with
the 365 and 400 nm excitation depends strongly on the sample concentration
(Figure 2E,F), whereas
that with excitation wavelength of 470 and 500 nm is essentially independent
of the sample concentration (Figure 2G,H). Empirically, the sample fluorescence depolarization
linearly increases with the increasing light-scattering extinction
of the samples for the fPSNP fluorescence spectra obtained with the
365 and 400 nm excitations (Figure 2I,J). In contrast, the ones obtained with the excitation
wavelengths of 470 and 500 nm remain constant for the fPSNP samples
(Figure 2G,H).

Using the similar linear curve-fitting shown in Figure 2I,J, we obtained the analyte-specific
fPSNP fluorescence depolarization at each emission wavelength under
all four excitation wavelengths (Figure 2M–P). Apparently, the analyte-specific
fPSNP fluorescence depolarization is strongly emission- and excitation-wavelength
dependent. This is in sharp contrast to the small molecular fluorophores
dispersed in solution. The fluorescence depolarization of crystal
violet and rhodamine 6G dissolved in solution are totally independent
of their excitation and emission wavelengths (Figure S4, Supporting information).

Detailed reasons
for the strong excitation and emission wavelength
dependence of the fPSNP fluorescence depolarization are beyond the
scope of this work. Since fPSNPs are composite nanoparticles containing
rhodamine and alexa 532 in the polystyrene matrix, it is entirely
possible that there are a wide range of emitting species in individual
fPSNP that differ in their peak excitation and emission wavelengths,
as well as their fluorescence lifetime and the angle between their
excitation and emission dipole. Such emitting species can be well-dispersed
rhodamine and alexa 532, oligomers, or simple mixtures.

Whereas
the experimental data obtained with fPSNP (Figure 2) provide unambiguous evidence
that the multiplicative light scattering enhances the sample fluorescence
depolarization, quantitatively understanding the experimental correlations
depicted in Figure 2I–L between the depolarization enhancement vs sample light-scattering
extinction is challenging. The computational simulation performed
in the preceding section is for the light-scattering depolarization
enhancement induced by light scattering for the analytes that are
assumed to be pure light scatterers with no photon absorption and
emission. In contrast, a turbid fluorescent sample must simultaneously
contain photon absorbers, scatterers, and emitters. Computationally
modeling the effect of light scattering depolarization on fluorescence
depolarization is extraordinarily complicated as it must take into
considerations of the complex interplay of sample light absorption,
scattering, and emission, as well as the additive effect of the scattering
and emission depolarizations. Nonetheless, the fact that the higher
the intrinsic fluorophore fluorescence depolarization, the smaller
is the enhancement induced by the sample light scattering (Figure 2I–L) is consistent
with the computational simulation showing that the higher the intrinsic
scatterer’s scattering depolarization, the smaller is the enhancement
induced by the sample multiplicative light scattering (Figure 1G,H).

Extrapolating Fluorophore-Specific
Fluorescence Depolarization
through Cuvette Path Lengths
Sample dilution described in
the preceding section for extrapolating the intrinsic fluorescence
depolarization can be applied straightforward for applications where
dilution will not perturb the structure and composition of light-scattering
and emitting species. Such a technique is rarely applicable in realistic
fluorescence anisotropy or depolarization measurements for studying
the association/dissociation events, for sample dilution can perturb
the sample compositions. In this case, one can extrapolate the analyte-specific
fluorophore depolarization through measurements with a series of fluorescence
cuvettes with different effective path lengths (Figure 3).

(K) scattering extinction
spectra of one fPSNP sample measured with different cuvettes. The
four dash lines in (A), (F), and (K) are excitation wavelengths (365,
400, 470, and 500 nm) used for the fluorescence depolarization measurements.
The concentration of the fPSNP sample is 2 nM. Sample SSF depolarization

365, (C) 400, (D) 470, and (E) 500 nm. All as-acquired SSF are shown
in Figure S5. Sample depolarization at

fitting, with slopes, intercepts, and their standard deviations indicated
in the graphs. The error bars represent the standard deviations of
three measurements. Linear extrapolation of the analyte-specific fluorescence
depolarization (PaF) by linear curve fitting of the sample fluorescence
depolarization as a function of the cuvette path length is presented
in Figure S6, Supporting Information. Analyte
specific fluorescence depolarization spectra as a function of scattering
extinction at excitation wavelengths of (L) 365, (M) 400, (N) 470,
and (O) 500 nm. (L) and (M) are obtained by extrapolating the intercepts
of sample depolarization until scattering is zero as a function of
excitation scattering extinction for every emission wavelength. The
error bars represent the fitting errors of the intercepts from the
linear curve fitting. (N) and (O) are average sample depolarizations
measured with different cuvettes. The error bar represents the standard
deviations.

The fPSNP total photon
extinction, scattering extinction, and absorption
extinction are proportional to the cuvette path lengths (Figure 3A,F,K), indicating
the applicability of the Beer–Lambert Law to samples that are
simultaneously photon absorbers, scatterers, and emitters. Again,
the fluorescence depolarization of the fPSNP samples depends strongly
on the sample light-scattering extinction or cuvette path length for
the fluorescence emission produced with excitation wavelengths of
365 and 400 nm (Figures 3B,C and S6) whereas sample depolarization
with excitation wavelengths of 470 or 500 nm is essentially independent
of the scattering excitation or the cuvette path length (Figure 3D,E).

The analyte-specific
fluorescence depolarization obtained with
the linear extrapolation method is independent of the excitation and
detection beam sizes. This conclusion is drawn by comparing the analyte-specific
fluorescence depolarization of the fPSNP samples with spectra measured
with different excitation and detection monochromator slit widths.
Changing the monochromator slit width not only modifies the size of
the excitation and detection beam, it can also change the effective
photon excitation and detection path lengths.32 The analyte specific depolarization (0.21 ± 0.009) obtained
with a 3 nm slit width (Figure S7) is statistically
identical to that (0.21 ± 0.003) obtained with 5 nm (Figure 3G), indicating the
robustness of this linear extrapolation method.

The experimental
results obtained with the sample dilution and
cuvette path length are in excellent agreement, which provides a critical
validation of the cuvette path length approach. The sample fluorescence
depolarization as a function of the sample extinction intensity shown
in Figure 3G–J
is very similar to its corresponding counterpart shown in Figure 2I–L. The emission
wavelength-dependent analyte-specific fluorescence depolarization
in Figure 3L–O
also agrees well with its corresponding counterparts in Figure 2M–P. A head-to-head
comparison of the results obtained with the two extrapolation methods
is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S8).

The data obtained with the excitation wavelength
of 365 and 400
nm indicate that it is unreliable to approximate the analyte-specific
fluorescence anisotropy as the sample fluorescence anisotropy measured
with the 3 mm cuvette, the smallest commercially available one. Taking
365 excitation as an example (Figure 3G), the fluorescence depolarization acquired with the
3 mm square cuvette is 0.29 ± 0.004 whereas the extrapolated
analyte-specific depolarization is only 0.21 ± 0.003, yielding
a difference of 38%. One potential solution is to use even smaller
cuvettes (commercial or custom-made) for the fluorescence depolarization
measurements. Such an approach is, however, operationally difficult.
Indeed, sample handling becomes incredibly difficult even with the
3 mm square cuvette. Both bubble trapping and strong surface tension
make the sample loading as well as cuvette cleaning challenging.

Although fluorescence depolarization and anisotropy are interconvertible,
the cuvette-path-length- and sample-concentration-based linear extrapolating
methods are only applicable for fluorescence depolarization but not
for fluorescence anisotropy (Figure S9,
Supporting Information). Such difficulty arises from the nonlinear
relationship between fluorescence depolarization and anisotropy (eq 1). For applications where
fluorescence anisotropy is desirable, one can use a suitable linear
extrapolation method to obtain the fluorescence depolarization and
then convert it into anisotropy.

Quantification of the Analyte-Specific
Fluorescence Depolarization
in Aggregation-Induced Emission (AIE)
An example application
of the linear extrapolation of the analyte-specific fluorescence depolarization
through the sample fluorescence depolarization as a function of the
cuvette path length is demonstrated with aggregation-induced emission
(AIE) of TPE. The experimental results are compared with those from
the linear extrapolation through sample dilutions (Figure 4). AIE has gained tremendous
interest in the recent literature for its applications in electroluminescence
devices, fluorescence sensors, and cell imaging.33−40 However, quantitatively understanding the optical properties of
AIE is challenging because essentially all AIE samples are simultaneous
photon absorbers, scatterers, and fluorescence emitters, as many literature
AIE samples appear to have high turbidity.41−43 Therefore,
one should correct the light-scattering depolarization to obtain the
analyte-specific fluorescence depolarization or anisotropy of the
emitting aggregates.

(D) Sample fluorescence depolarization as a function of the nominal
TPE concentrations. (H) Sample fluorescence depolarization PsF as a function of the cuvette path length. The nominal TPE concentration
used for data in (H) is 200 μM. The PaF is linearly extrapolated
analyte-specific fluorescence depolarization.

TPE is one of the most commonly studied model AIE reagents,41 and it serves as an excellent example for illustrating
the technical challenge in the quantitative understanding of the AIE
photon absorption, scattering, and emission properties. TPE is highly
soluble in THF but insoluble in water. Even 1 mM TPE can fully dissolve
in THF, and the sample solution is completely transparent with no
detectable fluorescence activities. In contrast, a 200 μM TPE
solution in THF/water (v/v 1:9) mixture solvent is highly turbid but
exhibits a strong fluorescence emission (Figure S10, Supporting Information), with its PRS2 VV scattering signal
saturating the instrument detector (data not shown). Indeed, experimental
decoupling of the TPE light scattering and absorption extinction contribution
to its UV–vis extinction with PRS2 is possible only when the
nominal concentration is below 1 μM in the THF/water mixture
solvent. However, in this case, the fluorescence signal of TPE becomes
very low due presumably to the low nominal TPE concentration and the
possible dissociation of the TPE aggregates due to dilution (data
not shown). Therefore, it is currently impossible to experimentally
decouple the extinction contributions for TPE samples under the normal
AIE concentrations.

The upper row plots in Figure 4 are obtained through sample
dilution of TPE in THF/water
mixture solvent, whereas those in the lower row are for data acquired
with the same TPE samples but housed in a series of cuvettes with
different path lengths. The relative long tails in the UV–vis
extinction spectra (Figure 4A,E) in the wavelength region longer than 500 nm are due most
likely to the sample light scattering. No spectral feature is observed
when TEP is fully dissolved in THF.

Using the instrument G-factor spectra obtained
by dividing the sample SSF HV by its SSF HH (Figure S11, Supporting Information) and the SSF data in Figure 4B,F, the fluorescence depolarization
spectrum of the TPE samples is calculated (Figure 4C,G) using eq 2 shown in the Introduction section. Not surprisingly,
the average sample fluorescence depolarization crossing the emission
wavelength region increases with the nominal TPE concentration (Figure 4D) or the cuvette
path length (Figure 4H).

It is unreliable to linearly extrapolate the analyte-specific
fluorescence
by using the sample fluorescence depolarization as a function of the
nominal TPE concentration (Figure 4C). First, the first data point apparently deviates
significantly from the linearity. Second, the structure and composition
of the aggregated TPE change in these samples. Recent research performed
with porphyrin indicates that dilution of porphyrin aggregated at
a high concentration induces instantaneous porphyrin disintegration.
Therefore, the sample-dilution extrapolating analyte-specific fluorescence
depolarization is not recommended for samples involving association/disassociation
equilibrium.

In contrast, the linearity between the sample fluorescence
depolarization
and cuvette path length enables us to extrapolate the TPE-specific
fluorescence depolarization, the intercept of the linear curve-fitting
(Figure 4H). The actual
TPE fluorescence depolarization is 0.54 ± 0.002, which is 27.8%
and 9.3% smaller than the sample fluorescence depolarization measured
with 10 and 3 mm square cuvettes, respectively.

The fact that
TPE has such small fluorescence depolarization is
likely due to its large aggregation size, which reduces its mobility
in solution. This data is consistent with a recent report that dispersed
porphyrin has fluorescence depolarization as large as 1 whereas the
fluorescence depolarization of the aggregated porphyrin is as small
as 0.5.18 The fact that TPE emission depolarization
is approximately independent of both its excitation and detection
wavelengths is surprising, given the relatively broad size distribution
of the TPE aggregates (particle diameter ranges from 316 to 416 nm, Figure S10). Fluorescence depolarization is a
function of fluorescence lifetime and fluorophore rotational frequency;
both parameters should relate to the size of TPE AIEgen. Furthermore,
the excitation and emission spectra of TPE AIEgen can also be size
dependent. Future work is needed to understand the wavelength independence
of fluorescence depolarization of the aggregated TPE.

Conclusions
In summary, light
scattering and fluorescence depolarization are
important for studying analyte structural and optical properties but
multiplicative light scattering complicates the determination of analyte-specific
light scattering and fluorescence depolarization. Both computational
simulation and experimental investigation reveal that multiplicative
scattering introduces scattering depolarization even when the scatterers’
intrinsic scattering depolarization is zero. The linear extrapolation
method that employs a series of cuvettes with different path lengths
provides a simple strategy to obtain the analyte-specific light scattering
and fluorescence depolarization. This method is easy to implement
and especially valuable for fluorescent anisotropy or depolarization
studies where sample dilution is problematic. The example application
demonstrated in this work should be directly applicable to the growing
number of researches on aggregation-induced emission wherein the samples
are usually highly turbid. For applications where fluorescence and
scattering anisotropy are desirable, one can readily convert their
linearly extrapolated depolarization into anisotropy.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Equipment
Polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs,
Cat #16688) and fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (fPSNPs, Cat
#18719) were obtained from Polysciences, Inc. They both have a nominal
diameter of 0.1 μm. Crystal violet perchlorate (Cat #255246),
Rhodamine 6G (Cat #R4127), and 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethylene (TPE) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Nanopure water
(18.2 MΩ cm, Thermo Scientific) was used for solution preparation.
The UV–vis extinction spectra were acquired using a Thermo
Scientific Evolution 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer. Polarized
Stokes’-shifted fluorescence (SSF) and polarized resonance
synchronous spectroscopy (PRS2) spectra were obtained with a Horiba
Fluoromax-4-spectrofluorometer equipped with computerized excitation
and detection polarizers. All PRS2 spectra were acquired with a 1
cm × 1 cm fluorescence cuvette. Unless stated otherwise, fluorescence
measurements for each sample were performed with all four square cuvettes
with lengths and widths of 3 mm × 3 mm, 4 mm × 4 mm, 5 mm
× 5 mm, and the 10 mm × 10 mm, respectively.

UV–Vis,
Polarized SSF, and PRS2 Measurements
The UV–vis extinction
spectra were acquired with a slit width
of 2 nm. The widths of both the excitation and detection monochromator
slits were 2 nm, and the spectral integration time was 0.3 s in SSF
and PRS2 spectral acquisitions, except that the polarized SSF spectra
of fPSNPs acquired with excitation wavelengths of 365 and 400 nm were
obtained with an enlarged slit width of 5 nm to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio. For the PRS2 and polarized SSF spectra, the vertically oriented
polarization is abbreviated as “V” and the horizontally
one as “H”. Excitation polarization is indicated prior
to detection polarization. As an example, “PRS2 VH”
refers to a spectrum acquired with vertical polarization at excitation
and horizontal detection polarization. The polarized SSF and PRS2
spectra were obtained by “S1/R1 spectra”, where the
signal from the sample detector (S1) has been normalized with that
from the reference detector (R1) so that spectral variation caused
by wavelength- and/or time-dependent intensity fluctuations in the
xenon lamp is eliminated. All PRS2 and polarized SSF spectra shown
in this work were solvent-background-subtracted before further data
processing. The G-factor spectrum needed for correcting
the instrument polarization bias in the light scattering and fluorescence
depolarization measurements was obtained with PSNPs reported in this
work. Sample depolarization (Ps(λ))
is calculated using the equation .

TPE Sample Preparation for the Emission-Induced Emission
Stock TPE solution of 2 mM was made in THF. Subsequently, 0.3 mL
of THF stock solution was added and mixed with 2.7 mL of water to
prepare the aggregated TPE stock solution in THF/water (v/v = 1:9)
of 200 μM. The diluted aggregated TPE series was prepared by
diluting the 200 μM aggregated TPE solution by the THF/water
mixture solvent into 100, 50, and 12.5 μM. Its polarized SSF
spectra were acquired with excitation of 365 nm and emission wavelengths
from 375 to 650 nm. All measurements are done after a 1 h incubation
to ensure complete TPE assembly.

Computational Simulation
The computational simulations
were carried out using a finite step scattering program developed
by coauthor Zou on the basis of the Mie scattering theory. In the
simulations, the incident light ray propagated along Z axis with polarization along X axis and the detection
window was arranged along Y axis. In each step, the
light travels 1000 cm. The light may propagate along the previous
path direction or be scattered by the medium in a 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette.
The scattering efficiency was calculated on the basis of the thickness
of the path (1000 cm) and the concentration of the scatterer. The
scattered light ray may propagate along 100 previously generated random
directions controlled by a random number generator. The depolarization
of the scattered light along any selected direction was determined
by the Mie theory. The step will continue until the light ray is out of the
range of the cuvette. Over 1000 trajectories were simulated for the
statistical accuracy of the calculations.
