In
this paper, we illustrate an efficient, convenient, and simplistic
fluorescence technique for the specific identification for nitro explosive
2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) in 100% water medium by bright cyan blue
color-emitting poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-supported copper nanoclusters
(PVP-CuNCs) as a fluorescence probe. PVP-CuNCs exhibited linear fluorescence
quenching response toward the increasing concentration of TNP analyte.
Surprisingly, TNP only reduces the emission signal of PVP-CuNCs, whereas
various nitro explosives cause very slight reducing emission intensity,
validating the good specificity of the PVP-CuNC probe toward TNP.
The highest Stern–Volmer quenching constant (Ksv) value of 1.03 × 107 dm3 mol–1 and the extremely lowest limit of detection
of 81.44 × 10–12 mol dm–3 were achieved solely for TNP in 100% water medium which is astonishing
and exclusive for this nanoprobe. The sensing pathway for the high
sensitivity of PVP-CuNCs assay to quantify the TNP is expected to
combine with the inner filter effect process and static quenching.
The static quenching mechanism between TNP and PVP-CuNCs is further
verified by fluorescence decay measurements. Furthermore, the developed
fluorescence sensing platform is applied for the quantification of
a trace amount of TNP in real samples named dam water, sea water,
and match stick.

Introduction
Nowadays, the quantification
of explosive chemicals is essential
for homeland security, military operations, humanitarian efforts,
and environmental cleaning.1 Nitroaromatic
explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP, picric acid), 2,4-dinitrotoluene
(DNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) are frequent components of
industrialized explosive chemicals and originates in global landmines,
that construct a main aim in dangerous nitro explosive determination.1−3 Among them, TNP is a stronger explosive material which contains
high explosion velocity and low security coefficient and is broadly
utilized until World War I owing to the fact that it has potent explosive
properties than TNT.4−6 Furthermore, TNP has more significance in pharmaceuticals
(antiseptic), militaries, and matchstick and dye industries.7−9 Instead of such values, TNP induces several sensitive health effects:
TNP is partly ascribed to the nitro and phenol functionalities. TNP
is a reason for sturdy irritation to the skin/eye, and it is a main
source of the prospective scratch to the organs concerned in the respiratory
system.10 Moreover, because of the electron
deficient nature of TNP, the degradation of TNP is more complicated
in the ecosystem which is possibly accountable for several chronic
diseases, namely, cancer and cyanosis.11,12 Hence, there
is an imperative necessity to build up finer methodologies for examining
the trace amount of TNP in aqueous solution to environmental pollution
as well as to prevent terrorist fears.

Various analytical methodologies,
including high-performance liquid
chromatography,13 surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy,14 nuclear quadrupole resonance,15 electrochemical methods,16 thermal neutron analysis,17 ion
mobility spectrometry,18 and energy-dispersive
electron diffraction techniques19 have
been documented for the determination of TNP. Even though, these methods
are extremely selective and relatively high-priced, they need a long
time for analysis and regular careful calibration is necessary. Moreover,
the specific quantification of trace amounts of TNP has not been an
easy assignment. In this consideration, fluorescent-based methodologies
are mostly important and probable for the fast determination of TNP
at room temperature because of good response, super sensitivity, and
simple operation. Recently, luminescent nanomaterial-based fluorescent
sensors are more interesting.

Several inorganic fluorescent
nanostructures, named MoS2 quantum dots, graphitic carbon
nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets, and CdTe/ZnS quantum
dots were utilized for the quantification
of TNP.20−22 These inorganic luminescent material-based TNP-sensing
tactics are not suitable and also these materials are very toxic in
nature. Hence, the ultrasensitive and selective determination of TNP
in an eco-friendly medium remains a challenging task. To date, fluorescent
gold (Au), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu) nanoclusters (NCs) have materialized
as an attractive nanomaterials and these NCs are applied in the area
of chemo-biosensors, bioimaging, and catalytic applications owing
to their low toxic, outstanding photostability, better quantum yield,
large Stokes shifts, biocompatibility, and water solubility.23−25 Among them, fluorescent CuNCs have received superior interest over
AgNCs and AuNCs as the precursor for the synthesis of CuNCs because
they are comparatively abundant, cheap, and readily existing from
commercial sources.26,27 Furthermore, fluorescent CuNCs
became good choice for biological cell labelling and imaging and these
CuNCs were used as a fluorescent probe for the determination of different
analytes.27−32 Although, numerous ascertained applications were documented in modern
times by using the CuNCs, however NCs applications in the quantification
of TNP are very few. For example, very recently, cysteine-functionalized
CuNCs were used for the detection of TNP with the limit of detection
(LOD) being 0.19 μM.33 Wu et al.,
reported that bovine serum albumin-stabilized CuNCs were applied as
a fluorescence probe for the determination of TNP with the LOD value
being 0.12 μM.34

In this work,
Cu-based fluorescent NCs were applied for the quantification
of trace amounts of TNP with high selectivity and sensitivity in aqueous
medium. Poly(vinylpyrrolidine) (PVP)-supported CuNCs were prepared
by the reduction of Cu2+ ions with ascorbic acid (AA) in
water at ambient temperature. PVP-CuNCs exhibit the emission maxima
at 430 nm and when excited at 380 nm show cyan blue color emission
under an ultraviolet (UV)-lamp. Emission features of PVP-CuNCs were
efficiently reduced and quenching efficiency is linearly enhanced
with increasing concentration of TNP. With an outcome from emission
spectral experiments of PVP-CuNCs with TNP, the concentrations of
TNP are estimated. Other nitro aromatic compounds and some potentially
interfering molecules which did not influence the emission intensity
of PVP-CuNCs have suggested the excellent selectivity of this method.
Furthermore, the developed sensing approach was applied for the various
real samples such as dam water, sea water, and matchstick.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of PVP-CuNCs
CuNCs
were prepared by
treating the mixture of PVP and Cu2+ ions with AA in pH
6.0 at ambient temperature. In the reaction mixture, Cu2+ ions are connected to the nitrogen (N) atom by the relation of lone
pair electrons of N atom with unfilled orbital of Cu2+ ions,
ensuing in regions of their high concentration. AA is a gentle reducing
reagent, capable to reduce Cu2+ ions preferably at such
sites.35 After completion of the reduction
process, PVP-supported CuNCs were collected. The resultant PVP-CuNCs
were characterized by emission, absorption, high resolution transmission
electron microscope (HR-TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and
zeta potential measurements.

To investigate the emission characteristics
of the collected PVP-CuNCs, emission and excitation spectra of PVP-CuNCs
were monitored and analogous results are displayed in Figure 1. As depicted in Figure 1, PVP-CuNCs illustrated an
emission maximum at 430 nm under excitation wavelength at 380 nm (solid
line) and PVP-CuNCs show well-defined excitation spectrum at 380 nm
(dotted line). As described in the inset of Figure 1a, the resultant PVP-CuNC colloidal dispersion
is yellow in color under day light and shows strong cyan blue color
emission under an UV lamp (λ = 365 nm). UV–vis absorption
of the spectrum of PVP-CuNCs is presented in Figure S2. As illustrated in Figure S2,
PVP-CuNCs did not observe any surface plasmon resonance peak at 560
nm which clearly indicates the creation of CuNCs instead of larger
Cu nanoparticles. Similar kinds of absorption spectral results for
CuNCs were reported earlier.32,33,35

= 365 nm).

The size distribution and morphology
of highly fluorescent cyan
blue emissive PVP-CuNCs were characterized by HR-TEM analysis and
resultant HR-TEM images at different magnifications are visualised
in Figure 2. As noticed
in Figure 2, HR-TEM
images of PVP-CuNCs show roughly quasi spherical in morphology and
monodispersed with average size ∼2.8 ± 0.3 nm. Moreover,
HR-TEM images did not show larger Cu nanoparticles or aggregation
because of the protective layer of PVP template. In addition, the
morphological characteristics of PVP-CuNCs in aqueous medium DLS measurement
were recorded and typical DLS observation is provided in Figure S3. The average hydrodynamic diameter
size of PVP-CuNCs is around ∼5 nm (Figure S3). PVP-CuNCs were further distinguished by zeta potential
analysis. The value of the zeta potential measurement data provides
a suggestion of the stability of the nanostructures in solution medium.36−38 Zeta potential result for PVP-CuNCs is shown in Figure S4. As depicted in Figure S4, zeta potential value of PVP-CuNCs is found as −30.6 mV,
which suggested that the stability of the PVP-CuNC colloidal solution
was based on steric stabilization by the PVP template. Similar kind
of PVP-supported metal nanoparticles was reported earlier.39 From the above results, PVP-supported CuNCs
successfully prepared.

Figure 2 HR-TEM images of PVP-CuNCs at different magnifications.

Stability of PVP-CuNCs
The stability of highly fluorescent
PVP-CuNCs was examined by evaluating the emission intensity of PVP-CuNCs
at various time intervals up to 30 days and the collected emission
spectral data are portrayed in Figure S5. It can be seen from Figure S5, we found
that the emission intensity of freshly prepared and up to 30 days
aged PVP-CuNCs remained the similar. These observations clearly designate
that the resultant cyan blue emissive PVP-CuNCs are extremely stable
in suspension medium in 30 days. Furthermore, photostability of PVP-CuNCs
was inspected under constant irradiation of PVP-CuNCs with UV light
for 120 min and corresponding results are given in Figure S6. As exposed in Figure S6, no noticeable alteration in the emission intensity was examined
which clearly points out the good photostability of PVP-CuNCs. In
addition, the stability of PVP-CuNCs at various ionic strengths was
also evaluated by the emission intensity of PVP-CuNCs in the presence
of various anions (50.00 × 10–3 mol dm–3). The relative emission intensity was calculated
by the fraction of the emission intensities of PVP-CuNCs before and
after the addition of various anions and is publicized in Figure S7. As described in Figure S7, most of the anions did not influence the emission
intensity of PVP-CuNCs. Interestingly, PVP-CuNCs are tolerant at an
ionic strength of up to 50.00 × 10–3 mol dm–3 concentrations of NaCl, which recommends that this
nanoprobe is appropriate for the determination of TNP in the occurrence
of higher ionic species in real water samples (Figure S8).

Sensitive Detection of TNP by PVP-CuNCs
For the good
chemosensors, fast response to the target is extremely vital. To discover
the probable application of the highly fluorescent PVP-CuNCs for the
detection of TNP in aqueous solution, quantitative determination of
TNP using the spectrofluorimetry approach by PVP-CuNCs was investigated.
The fluorescence spectral changes of PVP-CuNCs with various amounts
of TNP are given in Figure 3. In the absence of TNP, PVP-CuNCs show maximum emission at
430 nm while showing exciting wavelength at 380 nm (Figure 3). As visualized in Figure 3, the emission intensity
of PVP-CuNCs was steadily reduced with increasing concentration of
TNP, simultaneously emission color of the solution also changes from
cyan blue to colorless under UV light (inset of Figure 3).

dm–3. (λexi = 380 nm, λemi = 430 nm). Inset shows PVP supported CuNCs without (i)
and with (ii) the last addition of TNP. Condition: 100% water medium.

Interestingly, when 144.00 ×
10–9 mol dm–3 of TNP solution
was added into the PVP-CuNCs colloidal,
the emission characteristics of the CuNCs were nearly 98% quenched.
The achieved emission spectral response has clearly designated that
PVP-CuNCs can rapidly quantify the trace amount of TNP. To find the
linear relationship and lowest detection limit of the present approach,
the emission intensities of the PVP-CuNCs were plotted against various
amounts of TNP analyte and yielded calibration curve is shown in Figure 4. Calibration graph
illustrates that the proposed sensing tactic is well linear fit with
concentrations ranging from 6.00 × 10–9 to
144.00 × 10–9 mol dm–3. According
to (3σ) the International Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
criterion, LOD is calculated as 81.44 × 10–12 mol dm–3.

concentrations
of TNP.

Emission Quenching Mechanism
The emission quenching
follows various pathways such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET), exited state reactions, inner filter effect (IFE), ground
state complex formation, and dynamic quenching.21,33,34,40 Both in the
IFE and FRET process, generally there must be an excellent spectral
overlap between the emission or excitation spectrum fluorescence probe
and UV–vis absorption spectrum of analyte. To explore the exact
emission quenching mechanism for the PVP-CuNCs, ocular characteristics
of TNP and PVP-CuNCs were tested. The spectral overlap between the
emission/excitation spectra of PVP-CuNCs (donor) and UV-absorption
spectrum of TNP (acceptor) is represented in Figure 5. As demonstrated in Figure 5, TNP exhibits a broad absorption spectrum
of 300–480 nm with strong absorption maxima at 353 nm. Furthermore,
upon the excitation of 380 nm, PVP-CuNCs give the strong and wide
emission maximum at 430 nm. The extensive spectral overlap of emission/or
excitation spectra of fluorescence probe and absorption spectrum of
TNP proposed that the observed emission quenching can occur from IFE
and FRET processes (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Normalised spectral overlap between the emission/excitation spectra
of PVP-CuNCs (donor) and UV-absorption spectrum of TNP (acceptor).

To differentiate the IFE and FRET
processes, time-resolved fluorescence
life time experiments of PVP-CuNCs in the absence and various concentrations
of TNP molecules were recorded and collected life time decay profile
is displayed in Figure 6. As demonstrated in Figure 6, the fluorescence decay data fitted by tri exponential function
and yielded life time value for PVP-CuNCs is 3.36 ns. Upon the addition
of different concentrations of TNP to PVP-CuNCs, very minor change
of fluorescence decay lifetimes from 3.36 to 3.33 and 3.33 to 3.28
ns (Table S1) has occurred. Fluorescence
lifetime observations eliminated the chance of the FRET process between
TNP and PVP-CuNCs. Different from the FRET process, two molecules
involved in the process IFE should not elementally interrelate with
each other and the analyte does not alter the average decay lifetime
of the fluorescence probe.41,42 Hence, the IFE process
is believed as one main process in the reducing emission intensity
of PVP-CuNCs by TNP. Even though the IFE process is generally considered
as a cause of error in fluorometric methods and the IFE process is
utilized as budding luminescent sensors. There is no rejecting that
the IFE process is significant, predictable, and a leading feature
in spectrofluorimetric methods. In this tactic, the IFE process-based
fluorescent chemo-biosensors did not necessitate ascertaining of any
chemical connecting between the analyte and fluorescence probe, however,
utilize the fluorescence moieties and acceptor which presents easy
and significant flexibility.43−45

Figure 6 Fluorescence decay profile for PVP-CuNCs
with various concentrations
of TNP in aqueous medium.

In addition, the coexistence of different emission quenching
pathways
including dynamic (collisional) or static quenching process is too
feasible. The emission quenching observations for PVP-CuNCs by TNP
were treated with the traditional Stern–Volmer equation (eq 1)40 1  where F0 and F denotes the IFE-corrected emission intensities of PVP-CuNCs
before and after the addition of TNP; Ksv is the Stern–Volmer constant; [TNP] represents the concentration
of picric acid; Kq denotes the quenching
constant; and τ is the average lifetime of the fluorescence
probe. According to the eq 1, the plot of F0/F versus [TNP] is displayed in Figure S9. It can be noticed from Figure S9 that
the Stern–Volmer curve shows well linearity with the concentration
ranging from 6.00 × 10–9 to 90.00 × 10–9 mol dm–3, and the correlation coefficient
is 0.9916. From the slope of the linear Stern–Volmer graph, Ksv and Kq are estimated
to be 1.07 × 107 dm3 mol–1 and 3.18 × 1015 dm3 mol–1 s–1, respectively. The obtained Kq value is much larger than the most scatter dynamic quenching
constant (2 × 1010 dm3 mol–1 s–1), representing the ground state complex formation
(static quenching process) between TNP and PVP-CuNCs.40 Recently, Shanmugaraj and John, previously demonstrated
the analogous behavior in the determination of TNP using cysteine-stabilized
CuNCs.33 In this case, highly sensitive
detection of TNP by PVP-supported CuNCs is because of strong emission
quenching and IFE process (Scheme 1) between the nanoprobe and analyte.

of Detection TNP by PVP-CuNCs
Effect of Other Interferences
Specificity is a crucial
factor to appraise the characteristics of a fluorescent sensing methodology
and selective identification of TNP is an exciting and interesting
section of research. For validating the specific quantification of
TNP by the present method, the emission characteristics of the PVP-CuNCs
by TNP were examined in the presence of various nitro-substituted
aromatic and potential interfering compounds. The relative emission
intensity and fluorescence color changes of PVP-CuNCs with 50-fold
higher concentrations of potential interfering compounds are displayed
in Figure 7. As depicted
in Figure 7, interestingly,
TNP only showed remarkable response toward the emission spectrum of
PVP-CuNCs compared to various other nitro substituted and potential
interfering analytes. In addition, the fluorescence color of the PVP-CuNCs
under a UV lamp (λ = 365 nm) also designated that insignificant
influences for the elected potential interfering salts display the
superb specificity of the present approach in the identification of
TNP and this methodology can be easily visualised with naked eye (inset
of Figure 7). Moreover,
it is important to observe that the emission or excitation spectrum
of PVP-supported CuNCs largely overlaps the UV–vis absorption
spectrum of TNP, whereas, other interfering substances have nearly
no absorption peak over the emission or excitation spectrum of CuNCs
involving the subsistence of IFE between PVP-supported CuNCs and TNP.
Therefore, in this approach, the IFE process increases the emission
quenching efficiency of PVP-CuNCs by TNP compared to other potential
interfering substances. The examined superb specificity toward the
TNP by PVP—CuNC-based selective recognition is elucidated through
combined ground state complex formation and IFE process. Furthermore,
PVP-CuNCs illustrated outstanding reaction toward the TNP only even
in the existence of 50-fold higher concentration of major interfering
nitro-substituted analytes which corroborates the utility of this
nanoprobe for the analysis of real water samples.

of 50-fold higher concentrations of common interfering nitroaromatics
and TNP in 100% water medium. Inset: Corresponding photographs under
UV light (wavelength = 365 nm).

Practical Applications
To further verify the specificity
and practical benefit of this nanoprobe, it investigated the PVP-CuNCs
to quantify the TNP in dam water, sea water, and matchstick head black
powder mixed water samples. No alteration in the emission spectrum
of PVP-CuNCs is monitored, PVP-CuNCs with real water samples which
are considered because of the absence of TNP. Nevertheless, when real
water samples were spiked with known concentrations of TNP level and
treated with PVP-CuNCs, while, the emission intensity of PVP-CuNCs
is reduced. It is clearly suggested that the observed reducing emission
intensity of PVP-CuNCs is solely because of the addition of spiked
concentrations of the TNP analyte. According to the emission quenching
experiments, the recoveries (%) of TNP levels were calculated and
are listed in Table 1. It is observed from Table 1, good recoveries (%) of TNP and the relative standard deviation
of real water samples were less than 2.82%, informing the super precision
and good reproducibility of the current method. Hence, it is worthy
to note that the resultant PVP-CuNCs were appropriate to analytical
application for the specific quantification of trace amount of TNP
in real water (dam water, sea water and matchstick head black powder
mixed water) samples. Furthermore, comparison of the current sensing
technique with previously documented methodologies for TNP quantification
were also made6,20,21,33,34,41,42,45−49 and are listed in Table S2. Among all
the sensing approaches, the current sensing technique is super-sensitive,
efficient, convenient, low-toxic, rapid, simplistic, and precise and
supplies consistent fluorescence spectral outcomes even at the trace
level of TNP in aqueous medium.

Conclusions
To summarize all, a fast, simple, low-toxic, convenient, and extremely
sensitive fluorescence platform is constructed for the specific identification
of trace level of TNP in aqueous medium by high cyan blue color-emitting
PVP-supported CuNCs. The resultant bright cyan blue color-emitting
PVP-CuNCs showed the emission intensity is almost completely quenched
(98%) with the final addition of TNP analyte. In addition, this methodology
is applicable to the naked eye detection of TNP by PVP-CuNCs under
an UV lamp. Lowest LOD of the PVP-CuNCs toward TNP in water medium
was about 81.44 × 10–12 mol dm–3. Time resolved fluorescence lifetime decay data were revealed that
the static quenching process involved between the TNP and PVP-CuNCs.
The superb emission quenching performance of PVP-CuNCs by TNP is recognized
to the ground state complex formation and IFE process. This simplistic
methodology demonstrated that the super specificity and potential
interference such as nitro-substituted analytes did not affect the
detection of TNP in water medium. High selectivity and ultra sensitivity
can assure PVP-CuNCs as a realistic nanoprobe for the quantification
of the trace amount of TNP in real water samples such as dam water,
sea water, and matchstick head black powder mixed water samples with
good recoveries.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Copper
sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) and
nitrobenzene were obtained from Merck.
PVP (mean molecular weight, ∼40 000), AA, TNP, 3,5-dinito
salicylic acid, 4-nitrophenol, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 2-nitrotoluene,
4-nitrotoluene, and DNT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Aniline,
phenol, benzene, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, 2-nitrobenzoicacid,
4-nitrobenzoicacid, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were collected from
Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd., India. All other chemicals were of at least
analytical reagent grade and utilized as received. Doubly distilled
water was used in the every experiment. All the analyses were performed
minimum three times and at room temperature.

Apparatus
Emission
spectral studies were monitored
by a JASCO FP-6600 spectrofluorometer with excitation wavelength at
380 nm in the emission mode. Both the emission and excitation slit
widths were kept at 5 nm. Absorption spectra were recorded from 800
to 200 nm by a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer with 1.0 cm quartz cells.
Nanostructure and morphology of NCs were verified by JEOL JEM 2100
HR-TEM operating at 200 kV. DLS information was evidenced to determine
the average size (hydrodynamic diameter) of CuNCs. DLS analysis results
were acquired by Malvern Zetasizer Nano. Zeta potential experiments
were recorded by Zetasizer Nano, ZS with 633 nm He–Ne laser,
equipped with a MPT-2 autotitrator (Malvern, UK). Fluorescence lifetime
experiments were performed on Horiba Scientific equipped with an NL-C2
pulsed diode excitation source of 380 nm.

Preparation of Poly(vinylpyrrolidine)-Stabilized
CuNCs (PVP-CuNCs)
CuNCs were prepared in accordance with
an earlier reported method.35 Briefly,
10 mL water was added to 0.5 g of PVP
and this solution was sonicated for 10 min, then the pH of the solution
was changed to 6.0 using 1.0 mol dm–3 concentration
of NaOH. Next, 0.1 mL of CuSO4·5H2O (100.00
× 10–3 mol dm–3) and 1 mL
of AA (100.00 × 10–3 mol dm–3) were dissolved with the PVP solution and this reaction mixture
allowed reacting for 6 days at ambient temperature (25 °C). After
6 days, clear yellow color solution was collected, the collected colloidal
solution exhibits cyan blue color emission under an UV lamp (λ
= 365 nm) which clearly indicates that the formation of PVP-supported
CuNCs. Finally, the obtained CuNCs were dialyzed against doubly distilled
water and stored at 4 °C for further application purpose.

Detection
Procedure for TNP
For the quantification
of TNP, different known concentrations of TNP were added into the
(0.750 mL) PVP-CuNC colloidal solution and make up to the mark of
5 mL standard measuring flask using doubly distilled water. This reaction
mixture was shaken well and incubated for 5 min at ambient temperature
(25 °C). Then, 2 mL of the reaction mixture was transferred to
the emission cuvette and the emission spectrum was recorded in the
range from 390 to 500 nm. All the experiments were carried out minimum
three times and the given data were mean of three individual experiments.
In the exploration of the selective determination of TNP in the present
approach, some nitro aromatic and aromatic compounds were elected
as interfering molecules. Specificity for TNP was verified by the
mixing of various nitro aromatic and aromatic stock solutions rather
than TNP by identical conditions. The relative emission intensity
of PVP-CuNC colloidal solution with 12.00 × 10–9 mol dm–3 of TNP remained unaltered after 5 min
which suggested that the reaction completed in 5 min. Hence, all the
emission titration experiments were made 5 min after the successive
addition of TNP (Figure S1).

Real Sample
Analysis
Siruvani dam water was collected
from Siruvani, Coimbatore, India and sea water was collected from
the ocean near Pondicherry beach, India. This sea water was filtered
thrice by qualitative filter papers. Matchstick head black powder
is acquired and suspended in aqueous solution by sonication method
and filtered. This filtrate of matchstick was applied for real sample
analysis. These real water samples were mixed with known amounts of
TNP and monitored by PVP-supported CuNCs. At last, emission spectral
responses were monitored by standard addition procedure. The recovery
(%) was determined as the ratio between amounts of added and estimated
TNP.36−38
