Abused
or misused carbadox (CBX) and cyadox (CYA) in animal feed
may cause food safety concerns, threatening human health. Here, we
describe the design of a novel hapten for preparation of a monoclonal
antibody against CBX and CYA simultaneously. Using this antibody,
colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA) was developed for
screening of CBX and CYA residues in chicken breast. Under optimal
conditions, semiquantitative analysis results were visible by eye,
with a visual limit of detection of 8 μg/kg for CBX and CYA,
and cut-off values of 20 μg/kg for CBX and 40 μg/kg for
CYA in chicken breast. Quantitative analysis could be performed using
a hand-held strip scanner, with a calculated limit of detection of
2.92 μg/kg for CBX and 2.68 μg/kg for CYA in chicken breast.
Validated by liquid chromatography–MS/MS, the developed GICA
provides a useful tool for rapid on-site CBX and CYA residue screening
in chicken breast.

==== Body
Introduction
Carbadox (CBX) and cyadox (CYA) belong
to the class of compounds
known as quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides, which are widely used as antibacterial
growth-promoting agents in animal feed.

Because CBX has mutagenic,
teratogenic, and carcinogenic properties,
many countries have forbidden its use in food animals.1 CYA is a novel species of quinoxaline and is considered
to be safer than CBX, and thus, has replaced other quinoxalines in
some countries.2 However some studies recently
reported that CBX might have potential mutagenicity and liver toxicities
at certain doses.3 Thus, it is necessary
to establish a screening method for CBX and CYA residues for animal-origin
food.

Several instrument methods have been established for detection
of CBX and CYA, such as high-performance liquid chromatography with
ultraviolet (UV) detection4,5 and high-performance
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS).6−8 Because of its high accuracy and sensitivity, HPLC–MS/MS
is used as the standard method for actual sample detection. However,
such methods usually need complex sample pretreatment, expensive instruments,
long detection times, and professional technicians. These disadvantages
restrict their application for the rapid screening of large numbers
of samples.

Compared with these instrumental methods, immunoassay
methods have
advantages of simple sample preparation, low cost, time-saving, and
convenient operation. For this reason, immunoassays, including enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA),9,10 colloidal gold immunochromatographic
assay (GICA),11−18 and fluorescence immunoassays,19−21 have been widely applied
in food safety on-site detection. Recently, some research studies
about immunoassays for the rapid detection of quinoxalines had been
established.22−29 As shown in Table 1, ic-ELSA and immunochromatographic assays have been developed to
simultaneously detect five quinoxalines: CBX, CYA, olaquindox (OLA),
quniocetone (QCT), and mequindox (MEQ).30 However, no immunoassays have been reported for simultaneous detection
of CBX and CYA in animal tissues.

In this work, we first designed
a novel hapten for CBX and CYA
monoclonal antibody (mAb) preparation. Based on this antibody and
the visualization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), a strip sensor was
fabricated for rapid detection of CBX and CYA residues in chicken
breast.

Results and Discussion
Hapten Design
CBX (MW = 262.23)
and CYA (MW = 271.24)
are both of low-molecular weight and have no immunogenicity. Thus,
they need to be coupled to a carrier protein to induce an immune response
by the mouse. However, CBX and CYA have no active groups (Figure 1a), such as −NH2 or −COOH that can react directly with a carrier protein.
In order to prepare a mAb which can identify CBX and CYA simultaneously,
we kept the shared structural element of CBX and CYA, (E)-2-(hydrazonomethyl)quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide, as the hapten (Figure 1b). Besides, the
−NH2 of the hapten can conjugate with a carrier
protein using the GA method. GA is a common protein coupling method
and can introduce a five carbon chain as the spacer arm that is beneficial
to exposure of the antigenic determinant. This results in conditions
that are favorable for the mouse’s immune system to produce
antibodies against CBX and CYA. The LC–MS/MS spectrum (Figure 2a,b) revealed a molecular
ion at m/z 205.1 [M + 1]+ at a retention time of 2.287 min, which supported a molecular formula
of C9H8N4O2 (MW 204.19).
The structure of the hapten in this work was also further confirmed
by 1H NMR spectrometry (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) (Figure 2c): δ 8.40–8.54 (m, 5H), 8.18 (s, 1H), 7.86–7.93
(m, 2H).

Antigen Characterization
Antigens, including hapten–ovalbumin
(OVA), hapten–BSA, and hapten–keyhole limpet hemocyanin
(KLH), were characterized by UV spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 3, the characteristic
UV absorption peaks of hapten and carrier proteins were at 378 and
280 nm. The antigens simultaneously had the absorption peak of hapten
at 345 nm and carrier proteins at 280 nm, and the obviously shifted
peaks indicated these antigens were successfully produced.

mAb Characterization
The sensitivity
of a mAb determines
to a great extent the sensitivity of the associated immunoassay. The
assay buffer plays a vital role in immunoassay analysis. The pH value,
ionic strength, and organic solvent content of assay buffer have an
effect on protein configuration, which will influence the conjugation
of the antibody and antigen.31,32 Besides, different
analytes have different dissolved conditions; for example, dibutyl
phthalate could be sufficiently dissolved at a certain concentration
of organic solvent; tetracycline could undergo hydrolysis under acidic
and basic conditions, and remain stable under neutral conditions.
In this work, NaCl content ranging from 0.4 to 6.4% was tested to
assess the effect of ionic strength. As shown in Figure 4a, the absorbance value decreased
significantly along with the increasing NaCl content. The maximum
absorbance value (Amax) was less than
1.0 when the NaCl content was greater than or equal to 3.2%. The biggest Amax/IC50 value was obtained when
the NaCl content was 0.4% in assay buffer. The methanol content and
pH value of assay buffer have few effects on Amax values. The biggest Amax/IC50 value was obtained when the methanol content was 10% and
the pH value was at 7.4 (Figure 4b,c). Thus, assay buffer with 0.4% NaCl content, 10%
methanol content, and pH 7.4 was used to establish the standard curve.
Under these optimum conditions, the IC50 values of CBX
and CYA were 1.84 and 1.85 ng/mL (Figure 4d), respectively.

Identification of the
mAb subtype benefits the selection of the
mAb purification method.33Figure 4e shows that the mAb against
CBX and CYA was subtype IgG2a, which can be purified using the salting
out method (caprylic acid–saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation
method), protein A, or protein G method.34 We used the protein G method for ascites purification to obtain
the mAb.

In general, a large Kaff value indicates
high mAb affinity. A high affinity antibody, with a Kaff value between 107 and 1012 L/mol,
can limit the consumption of antibody and antigen in immunoassay development.
Through fitting the curve in Figure 4f, [Ab]t values of 2.14 × 109, 4.94 × 109, and 2.50 × 109 mol/L
were obtained at the corresponding coating concentrations of 1, 0.3,
and 0.1 μg/mL, respectively. Substituting into the calculating
formula, the Kaff value of our mAb was
3.19 × 109 L/mol. In addition to establishment of
the GICA, this antibody was also applied in immunoaffinity column
development for the pretreatment of positive samples containing CBX
or CYA.35

The cross-reactivity of
our mAb is shown in Table 2. As shown, it has little cross-reactivity
with QCA, with an IC50 value of 25.5 ng/mL and cross-reactivity
(CR) of 7.3%. However, it shows no cross-reactivity with other quinolones
(CR < 1.0%), including OLA, MEQ, QCT, and MQCA. This indicated
that the methyl group had a significant influence on antibody generation
in the mouse.

Table 2 Cross-Activity of mAb
GICA Principle and Establishment
The schematic diagram
showing the GICA principle is shown in Figure 5. The GNP-labeled mAb was first conjugated
with target analytes (CBX or CYA) to form the GNP-labeled-mAb–CBX
(or CYA) complex. The complex flowed with the standard or sample solution
from the sample pad to the absorption pad due to the capillary action
of the absorption pad. When the solution reached the T zone on the
nitrocellulose (NC) membrane, the unconjugated GNP-labeled mAb conjugated
with the hapten–OVA on the T line. When it reached the C zone,
the GNP-labeled mAb always conjugated with the goat antimouse IgG
antibody on the C line. If the sample was negative, the GNP-labeled
mAb conjugated with the hapten–OVA and generated a red line
in the T zone. If the sample was weakly positive, some of the GNP-labeled
mAb could also react with the hapten–OVA on the T line and
produce a light red line in the T zone. If the sample was positive,
all of the GNP-labeled mAb conjugated with the CBX (or CYA), and no
extra GNP-labeled mAb could conjugate with the hapten–OVA sprayed
on the T line. Therefore, the T zone was colorless. Meanwhile, the
C zone would always appear as a red line because of the conjugation
between the GNP-labeled mAb and the goat antimouse IgG antibody. If
the C line was colorless, this indicated that the strip was invalid.

(b) Schematic illustration in negative, weakly positive, and positive
sample.

The coating antigen on the T line
and the amount of the mAb used
for GNP labeling was optimized. As shown in Figure 6a,b, when the coating antigen was hapten–OVA
and the amount of mAb was 8 μg/mL GNP solution, the T line color
was relatively lighter at a CBX concentration of 5.0 ng/mL, which
showed that the inhibition to CBX was relatively better.

for GICA. (a) Coating antigen on the T line; (b) mAb
amount for GNP labeling; (c) sample suspension solution.

The sample resuspension solution plays an important role
in actual
sample analysis. Three surfactant species (Tween-20, ON-870, and Triton-100)
at 3% in 0.01 M pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were optimized.
From Figure 6c, it
can be seen that the GNPs clumped on the sample pad, which resulted
in the T line and C line color being really light. Compared with PBS,
the addition of the surfactant increased the flow of sample solution
on the strip. However, it also caused visible GNP aggregation on the
sample pad when the surfactant was Tween-20 or ON-870. Consequently,
0.01 M PBS pH 7.4 with 3% Triton was chosen as the chicken breast
sample resuspension solution for analysis of CBX and CYA in this work.

Under the above optimal conditions, a series of fortified samples
(0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 10, 20, and 40 μg/kg) were tested to establish
the GICA method for detection of CBX and CYA residues in chicken breast.
As shown in Figure 7a,c, the cut-off values when the T line became colorless were 20
μg/kg for CBX and 40 μg/kg for CYA. The lowest concentrations
when the T line color become too light to see with the naked eye,
defined as the visual limit of detection (LOD), were 8 μg/kg
for both CBX and CYA. These results can be used for semiquantitative
analysis of unknown samples. If the CBX (or CYA) content of a sample
was equal to or greater than 20 μg/kg (or 40 μg/kg), it
was considered a positive sample. If the CBX (or CYA) content was
between 8 and 20 μg/kg (or 40 μg/kg), it was a weakly
positive sample, while if the CBX (or CYA) content was below than
8 μg/kg, the sample was negative.

and CYA in spiked chicken breast. (a,c) are
strip image results. 1 = 0, 2 = 2.0 μg/kg; 3 = 4.0 μg/kg;
4 = 8.0 μg/kg; 5 = 10 μg/kg; 6 = 20 μg/kg; 7 = 40
μg/kg. (b,d) are standard curves established for GICA analysis.

For quantitative analysis, results were evaluated
using a hand-held
strip scanner. The standard curves established with the chicken matrix
are shown in Figure 7b,d. Twenty blank chicken breast samples were tested, and the corresponding
CBX and CYA concentrations were calculated using the matrix standard
curve. The average plus three times the standard deviation was defined
as the calculated LOD (cLOD). According to this calculation, the cLOD
was 2.92 μg/kg for CBX and 2.68 μg/kg for CYA. Therefore,
the proposed GICA and hand-held strip scanner could be applied to
screening of CBX or CYA residues in chicken samples on site.

Validation
of GICA with LC–MS/MS
To evaluate
the accuracy, recovery tests were performed. Samples were spiked with
CBX (or CYA) at concentrations of 4, 8, or 12 μg/kg. From Table 3, we can see that
the recovery rate ranged from 89.5 ± 8.9 to 109.6 ± 10.3%
for CBX and CYA analysis, with coefficients of variation (CVs) ranging
from 9.0 to 14.6% in chicken breast. The LC–MS/MS results further
confirmed the proposed GICA, with recovery rates ranging from 93.9
± 8.9 to 114.4 ± 8.5%, and CVs ranging from 6.8 to 9.9%.
These results further confirmed the feasibility of the proposed GICA
method.

Conclusions
In this work, we designed a new hapten for production of a mAb
against CBX and CYA. Based on this antibody, a GICA was established
for semiquantitative and quantitative screening of CBX and CYA residues
in chicken breast samples. The detection process could be completed
within 15 min. Recovery tests validated the accuracy, and the LC–MS/MS
method further validated the results. In conclusion, the developed
GICA method could be applied for rapid detection of CBX and CYA residues
in chicken breast samples in the field.

Hapten Design
The scheme of CBX–hapten synthesis
is shown in Figure 1b, and comprised three steps, as follows.

Synthesis of 2-Methylquinoxaline
1,4-Dioxide
The compounds
2-methylquinoxaline (5.00 g, 34.7 mmol) and 3-chlorobenzoperoxoic
acid (29.9 g, 174 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (50.0 mL).
After stirring overnight at room temperature, this reaction mixture
was poured into ice/water. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane.
The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated. The residue was purified
on a silica column to give 2-methylquinoxaline 1,4-dioxide (4.10 g)
as a yellow solid with a yield of 67.2%.

Synthesis of 2-Formylquinoxaline
1,4-Dioxide
A solution
of 2-methylquinoxaline 1,4-dioxide (1.00 g, 5.68 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane
(10.0 mL) was added to selenium dioxide (1.26 g, 11.4 mmol) and stirred
overnight at 100 °C. The reaction mixture was then poured into
ice/water, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate.
The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated. The residue was purified
on a silica column to give 2-formylquinoxaline 1,4-dioxide (800 mg)
as a yellow solid with a yield of 72.7%.

Synthesis of 2-(Hydrazonomethyl)quinoxaline
1,4-Dioxide (Hapten)
A solution of 2-formylquinoxaline 1,4-dioxide
(500 mg, 2.63 mmol)
in dichloromethane (5 mL) was added dropwise to hydrazine hydrate
(410 mg, 7.88 mmol) and stirred overnight at room temperature. The
reaction mixture was poured into ice/water; then, the aqueous layer
was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were
washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated.
The residue was purified on a silica column to give the hapten (300
mg) as a yellow solid with a yield of 55.9%.

The structure of
the hapten was characterized by 1H NMR spectrometry and
LC–MS/MS analysis.

Antigen Preparation
The antigen was synthesized using
the glutaraldehyde method.36 In detail,
20 mg hapten was dissolved in 2 mL dimethylformamide and then 600
μL of glutaraldehyde, diluted ten times using PBS (0.1 M, pH
7.4), was added dropwise. Thirty minutes later, the activated solution
was divided into three equal volumes and each was added drop by drop
into a carrier protein solution (KLH, BSA or OVA, 5 mg/mL in 0.1 M
carbonate buffer solution pH 9.6). After 2 h of stirring the reaction
at room temperature, the conjugates were dialyzed six times against
0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4). Then, hapten–KLH, hapten–BSA, and
hapten–OVA were obtained and characterized using an UV–visible
spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The hapten–KLH
was used as the immunogen, with hapten–BSA and hapten–OVA
used as the coating antigens.

Immunization Schedule
Female BALB/c mice (6–8
weeks old) were immunized to produce antibodies against CBX and CYA.37 Before immunization, the immunogen was emulsified
with isometric FCA or FICA. Each mouse was then injected subcutaneously
with 100 μg hapten–KLH emulsified with FCA for the first
immunization. Every twenty one days, the mouse was given a booster
injection of 50 μg hapten–KLH emulsified with FICA. After
four immunizations, the serum of each mouse was assessed using ic-ELISA.
The detailed ic-ELISA procedure has been described in our previous
publication.38 The mouse with the highest
titer and the highest inhibition with CBX and CYA was sacrificed for
cell fusion. Three days before cell fusion, this mouse was injected
intraperitoneally with 25 μg hapten–KLH without any immunologic
adjuvant.

Cell Fusion and Hybridoma Screening
As described in
our previous reports,38,39 spleen cells and sp 2/0 cells
were fused at a ratio of 1:5–10 using the PEG method. Through
HAT medium culture screening, the hybridoma cells would survive culture
under 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cell supernatants were further
screened using ic-ELISA. The wells with the highest titer and highest
inhibition with CBX and CYA were subcloned using the limiting dilution
method. After three rounds of subcloning and screening of cell supernatants,
a single cell mass was picked out and cultured at an extended scale.
Then, this cell line was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Ascites
Preparation and Purification
Before being inoculated
intraperitoneally with hybridoma cells, BALB/c mice were injected
with sterilized paroline (1 mL/mouse). After seven to ten days, ascites
were collected using an injection syringe and then centrifuged for
10 min at 8000 rpm. The AKTA pure protein purification system (GE
Healthcare Little Chalfont, UK) was used to obtain pure mAb. The concentration
of mAb was tested using a NanoDrop One (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA).

mAb Characterization
The mAb characterization
indicators
included sensitivity (half inhibition concentration, IC50), antibody subtype, affinity (Kaff),
and CR %.

ic-ELISA Assay Optimization and Sensitivity
The ic-ELISA
assay buffer was optimized by testing various sodium chloride concentrations
(0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4% by mass fraction), different pH values
(4.7, 6.0, 7.4, 8.8, and 9.6), and methanol concentrations in PBS
(0, 10, 20, 30, and 40% by volume fraction). The IC50 at
each condition was obtained using the standard curve generated using
a series of CBX solutions (0, 0.14, 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3,
and 100 ng/mL). The ratio of absorption values of blank control (Amax) and IC50 value (Amax/IC50) was used to evaluate the ic-ELISA
performance.

Antibody Subtype
The antibody subtype
was determined
using a mAb isotyping ELISA kit.18 The
different HRP-labeled secondary antibodies included IgA, IgG1, IgG2a,
IgG2b, IgG3, and IgM.

Affinity
As described in our previous
publications,
the antibody was diluted from the 1 μg/mL stock to form a gradient
of 8-fold serial dilutions. The coating antigen (hapten–OVA)
concentrations were 1, 0.3, and 0.1 μg/mL. The mAb affinity
was tested by ic-ELISA. By fitting the antibody concentration to the
absorption values, the antibody concentration when the absorbance
is half of the initial value ([Ab]t) can be calculated.
The affinity constant (Kaff) was calculated
using the following equation, where n is the multiple
of two corresponding antigen concentrations37  

Cross-Reactivity
Other quinoxalines, including CYA,
OLA, MEQ, QCT, MQCA, and QCA, were used to evaluate the cross-reactivity
of the mAb. Similarly, the IC50 values of each quinoxaline
were determined. The CR % could be obtained from the following equation,
as described in previous reports40  

Gold Immunochromatographic
Assay
Preparation of GNPs
GNPs with a diameter of 25 nm were
synthesized using the citrate reduction method14,41 Briefly, 100 mL of chloroauric acid solution (HAuCl4·4H2O, 0.01%, w/v) was boiled under continuous stirring; then,
2.0 mL fresh trisodium citrate solution (1%, w/v) was added quickly
into the boiled solution. Five minutes after the color changed to
wine red, the solution was cooled to room temperature while stirring.
The solution was then stored at 4 °C for further use.

Preparation of GNP-Labeled mAb
First, the mAb was diluted
to 0.2 mg/mL using 0.2 M borate buffer solution (pH 8.8); then, 40
μL of 0.1 M potassium carbonate solution was added into 10 mL
of the GNP solution. Next, 400 μL mAb was added to the GNP solution,
and the mixture was allowed to stand for 45 min at room temperature.
Finally, 500 μL BSA solution (10%, w/v) was added to the mixture
and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the solution was
centrifuged at 8000 rpm, 4 °C for 45 min. The supernatant was
then removed, and the sediment was resuspended in 1 mL 0.01 M PBS
solution with 0.02% sucrose.

Strip Fabrication
The strip for
the GICA was made up
of four parts, comprising the sample pad, NC membrane, absorption
pad, and PVC backing sheet.42 The hapten–OVA
and goat antimouse IgG were sprayed onto the T zone and the C zone
of the NC membrane, respectively. The NC membrane was placed in the
middle of the PVC backing sheet, while the sample pad and absorption
pad were glued at either end of the PVC sheet with a 2 mm overlap.
After drying at 37 °C for 24 h, the fabricated card was cut into
strips with a width of 3.85 mm. The strips were stored in a dry environment
for further use.

GICA Procedure
To perform the test,
150 μL of
standard (CBX or CYA) or sample solution was mixed with 50 μL
GNP-labeled mAb in a microplate well. The mixture was incubated for
3 min at room temperature. The strip was then dipped into this well,
so that the solution flowed from the sample pad to the absorption
pad due to capillary action. After 5 min, the results could be visualized
by the naked eye. For quantitative analysis, the strip was tested
using a hand-held strip scanner, which could give the T/C value (the
ratio of color intensity between the T line and the C line) directly
within 30 s. The standard curve was established by fitting a series
of CBX or CYA standard concentration (X axis) against
T/C values (Y axis) using the logistic function.

Analysis of Spiked Chicken Breast Using the Strip Test
Chicken breast samples were purchased from a local supermarket and
were proven to be CBX and CYA-free by LC–MS/MS analysis. A
series of spiked CBX or CYA chicken breasts were examined using the
developed GICA method. Each sample was pretreated as follows: 5.0
g of minced chicken breast was weighted into a 50 mL centrifuge tube;
then, 20 mL of acetonitrile was added, and the tube was vibrated for
3 min. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min, after
which 4 mL of the supernatant was removed and dried using pressured
blowing concentrators at 45 °C. The residue was dissolved in
4.0 mL PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) containing 3% Triton-100 solution, and
80 μL was used for GICA analysis. The chicken substrate standard
curves were established for CBX and CYA quantitative analysis.

Recovery
Test
Fortified CBX or CYA chicken breast samples
at three concentrations (4, 8, and 12 μg/kg) were used to evaluate
the proposed GICA protocol. To validate the GICA results, these spiked
samples were tested using LC–MS/MS analysis at the same time.
