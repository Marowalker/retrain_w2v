In this study, all-inorganic copper
halide salt K2Cu2Cl6 single-crystal
and thin films were prepared.
The single-crystal diffraction data belonged to the monoclinic K2Cu2Cl6 (space group = P2(1)/C, unit cell parameters of a = 4.0340 Å, b = 13.7987 Å, c = 8.7445 Å, α = 90.000, β = 97.123, and
γ = 90.000). As far as we know, this is the first study of the
copper halide salt K2Cu2Cl6 for optoelectronic
applications. The band gap of K2Cu2Cl6 is calculated to be approximately 1.85 eV. A low-cost photodetector
based on the K2Cu2Cl6 thin film was
efficient under different monochromatic light from 330 to 390 nm with
different chopping frequencies (1.33–30 Hz). Density functional
theory (DFT) computational results indicate that the valence bands
(VBs) and conduction bands (CBs) are shifted up in energy using the
orbital-dependent correction to the DFT energy. Partial density of
states reveals that the VBs and narrow CBs are derived from the hybrid
orbitals of Cu2+ 3d and Cl– p, respectively.

Introduction
As one kind of metal
halide salts (MHSs), lead halide salts (LHSs)
have attracted widespread attention because of organic–inorganic
LHSs.1,2 Recently, the power conversion efficiencies
(PCEs) of solid thin-film solar cells based on organic–inorganic
LHS materials are more than 22%,3 which
is close to the PCEs of the commercially silicon solar cells. In addition,
organic–inorganic LHSs present promising performance in field-effect
transistors,4 light-emitting diodes,5 and so on. However, using organic–inorganic
LHS involves a number of challenges. First, the toxicity of Pb in
organic–inorganic LHSs cannot meet environmental friendliness.6 Second, the structure of organic–inorganic
LHSs can be easily destroyed by moisture and heat, resulting in poor
stability of the photoelectronic device.7 Thus, it is necessary to develop a high-performance, low-cost, corrosion-resistant,
nonprecious all-inorganic and lead-free MHS. Recently, numerous researchers
have developed alternative lead-free MHS materials,8 such as tin (Sn) halide salts,9 germanium (Ge) halide salts,10 bismuth
(Bi) halide salts,11 manganese (Mn) halide
salts,12,13 copper halide salts (Cu),14 and Sb(V) halide complexes15 for optoelectronic applications.

Results and Discussion
Herein, all-inorganic copper halide salt K2Cu2Cl6 single-crystal and thin films were prepared by a mixture
(as shown in Figure 1a) of 1 mM KCl and 1 mM CuCl2 in an aqueous solution. Figure 1b shows the synthesized
dark-red single crystals. The single structure is solved by a direct
method and expanded using difference Fourier techniques with the SHELXL-97
program. The single-crystal diffraction data are assigned to the monoclinic
K2Cu2Cl6 (space group = P2(1)/C, unit cell parameters of a = 4.0340 Å, b = 13.7987 Å, c = 8.7445 Å, α = 90.000, β = 97.123, and
γ = 90.000). The schematic diagram of the unit cell structure
is shown in Figure 1c (ball-stick), 1d (polyhedron), which indicates
that the Cu2Cl62– dimers are
located at the corners and center of the unit cell in the b–c plane. The structural refinement
and detailed crystal data for the K2Cu2Cl6 single crystals can be found in Tables 1 and 2 and Tables S1 and S2.

To characterize the
absorption property of K2Cu2Cl6,
UV–vis absorption spectroscopy was
carried out. Figure 2a shows the UV–vis absorption curve of K2Cu2Cl6 single crystals. Strong absorption from 300
to 568 nm is observed. The absorbance is decreased quickly from 568
to 628 nm, which indicates the existence of the band gap. It is very
interesting that the absorbance is relatively strong from 700 to 1100
nm. The reason may be the existence of the Jahn–Teller effect
or double spin chains in the K2Cu2Cl6 crystal structure. To obtain the band gap of K2Cu2Cl6, diffuse reflection spectroscopy of K2Cu2Cl6 single crystals was carried out as shown
in Figure 2b. According
to the previous literature,16 K2Cu2Cl6 can be regarded as direct allowed transition.
Thus, Eg for the thin film is determined
to be approximately 1.85 eV from the intercept of the linear part
of the [F(R)hv]2
plot on the X-axis.

The K2Cu2Cl6 thin films
(Figure 3a) were formed
by
a spinning–coating mixture of 1 mM KCl and 1 mM CuCl2 in an aqueous solution. To determine the structure of the film,
we measured the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the film. Figure 3b shows the XRD results of
the K2Cu2Cl6 thin film on TiO2. The diffraction peaks of K2Cu2Cl6 films at TiO2 are basically corresponding to the
diffraction peaks obtained by single-crystal diffraction data.

Figure 3b shows
the corresponding crystal faces of each diffraction peak. Strong peaks
at 12.08°, 12.94°, 16.52°, 26.70°, and 37.90°
are assigned to the (011), (020), (021), (111), and (132) planes,
respectively. The results indicate that the surface of the TiO2 electron-collecting layer induces the growth of K2Cu2Cl6 along (132). To measure the uniformity
and thickness of each layer in fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO)/TiO2/K2Cu2Cl6 device, we tested
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the cross-sectional
structure, which is shown in Figure 3c. The thickness of FTO is 348.54 nm. The thickness
of the K2Cu2Cl6 film is from 18.45
to 142.66 nm. Moreover, the thickness of the dense-TiO2 film on the FTO conductive glass is 33.54 nm. Also, the voids between
the TiO2 particles are very small, which will prevent short
circuit.

Under AM1.5, 100 mW/cm2 simulated illumination,
we studied
the photoresponse properties of the device (Figure 4a) by recording the photocurrent–time
characteristics. An evident Ion/Ioff photoresponse is observed, as shown in Figure 4b. We estimated the Q generated in the initial 5 s illumination by integrating
the I–t area, as shown in Figure 4c. Q is calculated to be 66.4 nC in the initial 5 s.

of the FTO/TiO2/K2Cu2Cl6/carbon electrode device. (b)

under the measured photocurrent density decay curve in initial 5 s.

To probe the photoresponse of
the device under the monochromatic
light, we recorded the Ion/Ioff photoresponse under different wavelengths with a flashlight
frequency of 1.33 Hz, as shown in Figure 5. The Ion/Ioff photoresponse is not observed under 300
nm. When the wavelength is shifted to 330 nm, the Ion/Ioff photoresponse is obvious.
The Ion/Ioff photoresponse clearly decreases when the light wavelength is tuned
to 390 nm. However, the device still has a photoelectric response
at this wavelength. The Ion/Ioff photoresponse is irregular when the wavelength of
light changed to 400 nm. Although the K2Cu2Cl6 thin film absorbs infrared light, we cannot measure the photoelectric
response in the infrared wavelength range. The reason may be the unsuited
structure or mismatched energy level. We will optimize the unsuited
structure or mismatched energy level to make it infrared-light response
in another study. We studied the Ion/Ioff photoresponse of the device at 330 nm with
different flashlight frequencies, as shown in Figure 6. The experimental results show that the
response of the device at 1.33 Hz is obvious. The photoelectric response
device at 20 Hz is also obvious. The regularity of the device at 40
Hz becomes weak.

FTO/TiO2/K2Cu2Cl6/carbon

a flashlight frequency of 1.33 Hz.

with a 330 nm light beam.

To better explain the density of states (DOS), the DOS and
band
structure of K2Cu2Cl6 were calculated
with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT). The results in Figure 7 indicate that the
band structure of K2Cu2Cl6 along
the highly symmetric points has a band gap of about 0.26 eV. It is
well-known that the calculated band gaps based on the general Kohn–Sham
theory are often to be underestimated compared to the experimental
value 1.70 eV. The total magnetic moment is 3.775 μB. Additionally, we considered the K2Cu2Cl6 band gaps obtained with these U–J values of 2, 3, and 4 eV as 0.39, 0.45, and 0.47 eV, respectively.
The total magnetic moment is increased to 4.00 μB with the U–J value of 4
eV. It is worthwhile that the valence bands (VBs) and conduction bands
(CBs) are shifted up in energy using the orbital-dependent correction
to the DFT energy. To further reveal the factors controlling the band
gap trends, DOS and partial DOS (PDOS) were calculated. PDOS reveals
that the VBs and narrow CBs are derived from the hybrid orbitals of
Cu2+ 3d and Cl– p, respectively. Thus,
the small gap of 0.26 eV is limited to the contribution of the hybrid
orbitals of Cu2+ 3d and Cl– p.

Figure 7 Calculated
band structure and DOS and PDOS projected on the constituted
atoms of K2Cu2Cl6 using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functionals with spin polarization. Note that the band gaps
are often underestimated in PBE calculations.

Conclusions
In summary, all-inorganic copper halide salt
K2Cu2Cl6 single-crystal and thin
films were prepared.
The single-crystal diffraction data belonged to the monoclinic K2Cu2Cl6 (space group = P2(1)/C). The band gap of K2Cu2Cl6 is determined to be approximately 1.85
eV. A low-cost and efficient photodetector based on the K2Cu2Cl6 thin film under different monochromatic
light from 330 to 390 nm with different chopping frequencies (1.33–30
Hz) is beneficial for future industrial production. The performance
is related to narrow CBs derived from the hybrid orbitals of Cu2+ 3d and Cl p.

Fabrication and Characterizations
of FTO/TiO2/K2Cu2Cl6/Carbon
Electrode Devices
The devices of the FTO/TiO2/K2Cu2Cl6/carbon electrode were fabricated
and characterized
according to the previous literature.16 The TiO2 layer was covered by the K2Cu2Cl6 layer by spin-coating the aqueous solution
of 170 mg CuCl2 and 75 mg KCl (3000 rpm for 30 s). The
active area of the FTO/TiO2/K2Cu2Cl6/carbon electrode devices was 1 cm2. The
photoresponse of the devices was measured under the bias voltage of
0.00 V.

Growth of K2Cu2Cl6 Single Crystals
Typically, 170 mg of CuCl2 and 75 mg of KCl were dissolved
in 4 mL of deionized water. The above solution was heated to 80 °C
via an oil bath. Then the solution was transported to an oven and
heated to 80 °C. The dark-red single crystal will be observed
by slow evaporation (from 80 to 40 °C for 20 h).

Single-Crystal
Characterization
The characterization
of the single crystal was according to the previous literature.16

Computational Methods
The DOS and
band structure of
K2Cu2Cl6 were calculated with spin-polarized
DFT implemented with the Vienna ab initio simulation package.17,18 The interaction between the electron and the ion is described by
the projector-augmented wave method.19 The
PBE20 functional is applied to describe
the electron exchange–correlation and the kinetic energy cutoff
is 520 eV. The experimental lattice parameters for K2Cu2Cl6 are used with a = 4.034 Å, b = 13.7987 Å, c = 8.7445 Å,
and β = 97.123°. The atomic positions were optimized until
the force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV/Å. The Monkhorst–Pack k point used in the structural optimization and calculations
of DOS were 6 × 2 × 3 and 10 × 4 × 6, respectively.
The band structure of K2Cu2Cl6 was
calculated along the highly symmetrical point in the Brillouin zone.
