The
natural healing process for tendon repair is associated with
high upregulation of collagen type III, leading to scar tissue and
tendon adhesions with functionally deficient tendons. Gene delivery
systems are widely reported as potential nanotherapeutics to treat
diseases, providing a promising approach to modulate collagen type
III synthesis. This work investigates a proof-of-concept four-arm
cationic polymer-siRNA polyplex to mediate a transient downregulation
of collagen type III expression in a tendon cell culture system. The
tendon culture system was first supplemented with TGF-β1 to
stimulate the upregulation of collagen type III prior to silencing
experiments. The four-arm poly[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl acrylate] (PDMAEA)
polymer was successfully synthesized via RAFT polymerization and then
mixed with siRNA to formulate the PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes. The formation
of the polyplex was optimized for the N:P ratio (10:1) and confirmed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. The size and solution behavior of
the polyplex were analyzed by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential,
showing a hydrodynamic diameter of 155 ± 21 nm and overall positive
charge of +30 mV at physiological pH. All the polyplex concentrations
used had a minimal effect on the metabolic activity of cultured cells,
indicating good biocompatibility. The dose and time effects of the
TGF-β1 on collagen type III gene expressions were analyzed by
qPCR, showing an optimal dose of 10 ng mL–1 TGF-β1
and 3-fold increase of COL3α1 expression at
48 h in cultured tenocytes. The PDMAEA-siRNA polyplex
concept observed a limited yet successful and promising efficiency
in silencing collagen type III at 48 h compared to PEI-siRNA. Therefore,
this concept is a promising approach to reduce tissue scarring and
adhesion following injuries.

==== Body
Introduction
Injuries to tendon
tissues are a common musculoskeletal problem
that can result in severe pain, reduced mobility, and diminished quality
of life in a certain patient population. Tendon injuries can arise
from sudden tendon rupture or can be chronic in nature, which is widely
known as tendinopathy.1−3

Tendon rupture can be caused by acute mechanical
overloading, whereas
tendinopathy occurs when the tissue is exposed to chronic overuse
or in age-related tissue degeneration conditions.4 When injuries occur, the natural healing process is complex
and varies in clinical outcomes based on the anatomical location of
the tendon tissue.

Furthermore, owing to the avascular nature
of tendon tissue, the
natural healing process is relatively slow and disordered resulting
in a wide range of changes at both cellular and molecular levels.
Typically, the wound healing process comprises three overlapping phases.
These are the inflammatory phase, proliferative phase, and tissue
remodeling.5,6

The management of cases with minor
injuries could be relatively
straightforward; often, a combination of moderate rest and/or medical
interventions may be sufficient. In other cases, the management poses
greater challenges, which may require advanced therapies. Several
approaches have been investigated to augment the healing process,
namely, the use of biologics (growth factors, cells therapy, siRNA)
or implantable materials (scaffolds).7,8 One of the
major challenges is the limited accessibility to human tendon tissues
to assess the clinical benefit of these new therapies. Consequently,
studies often rely on using animal models, and equine is one of them.9,10

As mentioned earlier, various cellular and molecular changes
occur
during the natural healing process.11,12 One of the
key features following tendon injuries is the formation of a scar
tissue (disorganized collagen fibers with mature fibroblast cells).1−3 Williams et al. studied the histological appearance and composition
of a scared tendon tissue and compared to that of a healthy tendon,
using equine superficial flexor tendon.13,14 Results showed
that the cell-to-matrix ratio was increased in the scar tissue. Moreover,
they reported a change in the type of collagen. In normal tendon tissue,
aligned collagen type I is the most abundant protein, which constitutes
95% of the tissue. In contrast, in the reparative scar tissue, a substantial
increase in the quantity of disorganized collagen type III was observed.
This increase in collagen type III may lead to a weaker tensile strength
when compared to that of a normal tissue. Other studies conducted
in human subjects have reported similar significant changes in collagen
type III concentration at the site of injury, but no significant changes
in collagen type I was observed.15−17

Endogenous expression
of growth factors is understood to orchestrate
the wound healing process. Both insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)
and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) seem to play a
pivotal role in the healing process, in particular on the expression
of collagen types I and III.11 Dahlgren
et al. studied the temporal expression of these endogenous growth
factors in equine flexor tendons following collagenase induced lesion.18 The result of their study showed an increase
in message levels for TGF-β1 in 1 week and IGF-I in 4 weeks.
Similarly, message levels for both collagen types I and III were increased
by week one and remained high for further 8 weeks.18 Others have used exogenous growth factors to bolster the
wound healing process by enhancing cellular expression of collagen.
Nonetheless, it is plausible that in cases where the expression of
collagen type III (disorganized smaller fibers) is exceeding and remains
at a high undesirable level in the regenerative phase of healing process
may lead to inferior mechanical properties, scar tissue formation,
and/or tendon adhesion.13,18−21 Therefore, discrete control and transient regulation of collagen
type III expression during the wound healing process may be more desirable
as a new therapeutic approach.

Several new approaches have been
investigated to manipulate the
concentration of collagen types and morphology of collagen fibers
by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA). One way to control expression of
collagen type III is by upregulating microRNA (miRNA) levels. Millar
et al. studied miRNA29a expression in both in vitro tenocyte culture
and in vivo models.22,23 They showed that miRNA29a is
able to regulate both IL-33 function and collagen type III synthesis.
Furthermore, interleukin-33 (IL-33) plays an important role in the
transition from type I to type III collagen synthesis in early stages
of tendon remodeling. Downregulation of miRNA29a was sufficient to
enhance collagen type III synthesis. In addition, small interfering
RNA (siRNA) and siRNA-mediated silencing have been developed to target
the gene of interest. For example, patisiran (Onpattro, Alnylam) is
an FDA-approved siRNA-based treatment used in the treatment of polyneuropathy
in patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, paving
the way for the use of siRNA for treatment of other conditions including
tendon-related disorders.24,25

Notwithstanding
the efficacy of siRNA treatment, administration
of naked siRNA is challenging as it can be degraded in the bloodstream
or unable to cross cell membranes and may pose risk to induce an immunogenic
response.26,27 With that in mind, numerous siRNA delivery
systems have been developed, including lipid-based and polymer-based
systems.28−30 The latter system is more accessible for customization
and optimization as its components can be defined and adjusted, using
a variety of starting materials and polymerization techniques.

Herein, we synthesized a new synthetic four-arm poly[2-(dimethylamino)
ethyl acrylate] (PDMAEA) polymer using reversible addition-fragmentation
chain transfer (RAFT).31 The synthesized
polymer was mixed with custom-designed siRNA to target collagen type
III to form polyplexes (a mixture of condensed polymer and siRNA)
in nanometer-sized range. In order to investigate the toxicity profiles
of these polymers and polyplex, cultured equine tenocytes were treated
with various concentrations of the polyplexes. We then induced overexpression
of collagen type III in the cultured cells using TGF-β1 growth
factor at optimal concentration, prior to treating the cells with
the polyplexes. Our result showed that the new polymer is well tolerated
by the cells when compared to standard PEI, and the collagen type
III message level was suppressed at 48 h of post-treatment compared
to 72 h when PEI polyplex was used. This study shows a proof of concept
to use a new and safe siRNA-based approach as a potential treatment
by regulating the collagen type III synthesis in tendon-related disorders.

Results
In this study, the aim was to use PDMAEA as the delivery vector
in the format of a polyplex for the delivery of specific siRNA to
knockdown the expression of COL3α1 in TGF-β1
stimulated tenocytes as shown in Scheme S1. A four-arm cationic DMAEA polymer was successfully synthesized
with a molecular weight of ∼10 kDa using our previously established
protocol (Scheme 1).31

Characterization
of PDMAEA-siRNA Polyplexes
Prior studies
demonstrated the significance of particle size, surface charge, and
method of preparation of polyplexes in gene transfection.32−35 Previously, we optimized the polyplexation of PDMAEA polymers with
model dsDNA.31 The results of this study
showed that a N:P ratio of 10:1 is ideal (the ratios of moles of the
amine groups of cationic polymers to those of the phosphate ones of
DNA) for the formation of a stable polyplex with hydrodynamic diameters
of 155 ± 21 and positive zeta potential values at a relevant
pH range. Hence, in this work, a N:P ratio of 10:1 for the PDMAEA-siRNA
polyplexes was used. Characterization of the polyplex was carried
out using agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the polyplex formation. Figure 1A demonstrates the
polyplex formation at a 10:1 N:P ratio (lane 2) compared to free siRNA
in the absence of the PDMAEA polymer (lane 1). Full-length agarose
gel electrophoresis is shown in Figure S2. Figure 1B demonstrates
the well-defined hydrodynamic diameter size and positive zeta potential
values of the PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes measured at pH 5.4, 6.4, and
7.4, in the pH range that occur during intracellular uptake. Particle
sizes are calculated from the intensity, number, and volume distributions.
The number and volume distribution are marginally smaller than the
intensity distribution but show a similar trend across all measured
pH values.

siRNA in the absence of the PDMAEA (lane 1) and PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes

in Figure S2. (B) Hydrodynamic diameter

intensity, number, and volume distributions, respectively. Black dots
above columns correspond to the zeta potential of the polyplexes measured
at pH 5.4, 6.4, and 7.4. All data are presented as mean ± SD
(n = 3). L (lane); nm.d (diameter in nanometers);
mV (millivolts).

Calculated mean sizes
for the PDMAEA-siRNA polyplex were 155 ±
21, 47 ± 7, and 82 ± 17 nm for intensity, number, and volume
distributions respectively. The mean zeta potential values are +41.6
± 2.2, +38.9 ± 1.6, and +29.7 ± 1.1 for pH of 5.4,
6.4, and 7.4 respectively. These variations between intensity and
number distributions are expected from DLS measurement owing to the
presence of heterogeneous polyplex populations. Notably, the positive
zeta potential value is greater at pH 5.4 compared to pH 7.4, likely
due to the higher protonation of the amine groups on the side chains
of the polymer at a lower pH value. Nonetheless, the size distributions
and zeta potential values of the PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes are within
the range of reported values for polyplexes employed in transfection
experiments.

Effect of the PDMAEA and PEI Polymers and
PDMAEA-siRNA and PEI-siRNA
Polyplexes on Cultured Tenocytes
The results in Figure 2A,B show the cytotoxicity
of PDMAEA and PEI polymers as well as PDMAEA and PEI-siRNA polyplexes,
as measured by the standard MTS assay, in cultured equine tenocytes,
at a range of polyplex concentrations of 0.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, and 50 μM and for the incubation times of 24, 48, and
72 h. All examined PDMAEA polymer and polyplex concentrations had
no or minimal effects on the metabolic activity of the cultured cells
compared to untreated control cells. Similarly, different incubation
times of the cells with the PDMAEA polymer or polyplexes resulted
in no significant changes in cellular metabolic activity. The results
indicated that both PDMAEA and PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes had low cytotoxicity
and were well tolerated by the cultured equine tenocytes. In contrast,
the examined PEI and PEI-siRNA polyplexes had significant (p < 0.0001) cytotoxic effects on the cultured equine
tenocytes, especially in concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 50 μM
and regardless of the incubation time.

Collagen Type III Expression Levels Remain Constant with Serial
Passaging of Equine Tendon Cells
The effect of serial passage
on its expression in equine tendon cells was determined to ensure
that collagen type III gene expression levels did not decrease over
time in culture. COL3α1 was expressed at high
levels at all passages between cells isolated from different donors,
although they were variable. No significant differences in COL3α1 expression were observed at any passage between
P0 and P10 (Figure 3A). In contrast, COL1α1 has a higher expression
at P0 than it does at P3 through to P10 (Figure 3B). However, COL1α1 levels do not significantly change beyond P3 with the further passage.

over serial passaging (P0 to P10) in three independent lines of equine
tendon cells. (A) COL3α1shows no significant
differences in expression between any passages. (B) COL1α1expression at P0 is significantly higher than at P3 through to P10
as indicated by the asterisk. However, after P3, there is no significant
change in COL1α1 expression with the further
passage. Statistical significance was tested using linear regression
analysis using R (v.3.5.2).

TGF-β1 Treatment
TGF-β1 was used to upregulate
the synthesis of collagen type III in cultured equine tenocytes. In
order to optimize the dose of TGF-β1, cultured tenocytes were
supplemented with different concentrations of TGF-β1 from 0.5
to 50 ng mL–1 for 24 h. The results in Figure 4A show the relative
expression of COL3α1 as measured by qPCR. The
data showed that the relative expression of COL3α1 (fold change) increases with increased concentration of TGF-β1
up to a 3-fold increase at 10 ng mL–1. However,
at higher concentrations of 25 and 50 ng mL–1 TGF-β1, COL3α1 exhibits lower fold increases of 2.5- and 1.5-fold,
respectively. Therefore 10 ng mL–1 was used in the
following experiments.

were treated with different concentrations of TGF-β1 for 24

qPCR. (B) Adult equine tenocytes were treated with 10 ng mL–1 TGF-β1, and COL3α1 mRNA levels were
analyzed by qPCR at 24, 48, and 72 h after stimulation. Data in panels

to untreated cells. The dashed line represents the baseline equal

gene expression was used to normalize the data. Data are presented
as mean ± range. TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1);
+TGF-β1 (adult equine tenocytes treated with transforming growth
factor-β1); -TGF-β1 (untreated adult equine tenocytes).

In addition, to study the fold changes in COL3α1 expression as a function of time, we examined
the fold change of COL3α1 in the cultured tenocytes,
using a concentration
of 10 ng mL–1 and incubation times of 24, 48, and
72 h. The results in Figure 4B demonstrate that COL3α1 expression
increased for all time points in samples supplemented with TGF-β1
compared to samples without TGF-β. Furthermore, the maximum COL3α1 expression occurred after 48 h of TGF-β1
stimulation.

PDMAEA-siRNA Transfection of Equine Tenocytes
Next,
the siRNA-mediated knockdown of COL3α1 in the
TGF-β1 stimulated equine tenocytes using PDMAEA-siRNA polyplex
was investigated. Cells with no added TGF-β1 and PDMAEA-siRNA
random polyplex were used as a negative control, whereas PEI-siRNA COL3α1 was used as a positive control. The results
in Figure 5 show the
fold change in COL3α1 as measured by PCR after
48 (Figure 5A) and
72 h (Figure 5B) compared
to the non-transfected control cells cultured in the absence of TGFβ1.
It can be seen that the target PDMAEA-siRNA COL3α1 polyplex mediated a reduction in fold change of 2 in COL3α1 expression compared to the non-target PDMAEA-siRNA-random after
48 h, providing a positive insight into the potential of the polyplex.
In contrast, the target PEI-siRNA COL3α1 polyplex
showed no reduction compared to the non-target PDMAEA-siRNA random.
However, at 72 h, the target PDMAEA-siRNA COL3α1 had no silencing effect compared to non-target PDMAEA-siRNA random,
but the target PEI-siRNA COL3α1 polyplex showed
a fold change of 2 reduction compared to the non-target PDMAEA-siRNA
random COL3α1. Nonetheless, the overall fold
increase of COL3α1in TGFβ1 treated versus
untreated cells was higher at 48 h compared to 72 h.

tenocytes. Adult equine tenocytes were treated

RNA); PEI (polyethyleneimine).

Discussion
The overall aim of this study was to establish
a simple formulation
based on a well-defined four-arm cationic polymer for the delivery
of siRNA. The intent was to target and suppress collagen type III
synthesis in an ex vivo tenocyte culture. In this study, a four-arm
PDMAEA cationic polymer with a molecular weight of approximately 10
kDa was chosen. This was based on a previously optimized system where
we demonstrated that this specific molecular weight was able to readily
form polyplexes with dsDNA molecules and reduce cytotoxicity compared
to its linear counterpart or “gold-standard” transfecting
agent PEI.31 We also demonstrated that
the four-arm PDMAEA polymer could form a polyplex with siRNA at a
relatively low N:P ratio, likely due to the lower steric hindrance
in the open four-arm structure. The hydrodynamic diameter of the formed
polyplexes was investigated at a pH range that resembles the changes
that occur in the cytosol. All concentrations examined of the PDMAEA
polymer successfully resulted in polyplex formation with the siRNA.
The resulting particles had an average hydrodynamic diameter of 155
± 21 nm. Previous reports suggested that particle sizes less
than 200 nm could be efficiently taken up by cells.36−38 Similarly,
the presence of a positive surface charge is reported to affect cellular
uptake.39,40 The zeta potential of the polyplexes at
relevant pH values above +20 mV is an indication of colloidal stability.

Previous studies showed a “tradeoff” relationship
between transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity of gene delivery
vectors. For example, polyethyleneimine (PEI), a non-viral vector,
is reported to produce high transfection efficiencies but demonstrates
significant cellular toxicity, as shown in the present work per results
in Figure 2A,B. In
contrast, we demonstrated that the PDMAEA polymer profile was well
tolerated in cultured equine tenocytes at different concentrations
and incubation times.31 Nonetheless, the
biocompatibilities of both the PDMAEA and PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes
were re-examined. There was no apparent cytotoxicity of the PDMAEA
or PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes in cultured tenocytes, rendering it a good
candidate for gene targeting. The biocompatibilities of the PDMAEA
and PDMAEA-siRNA polyplex were illustrated at a range of concentrations
(including the concentration used in transfection). The MTS standard
metabolic assay was used, which is often used to measure the cytotoxicity
of molecules in cultured cells.41 The results
showed that the polymer and the polyplex concentrations used had minimal
cytotoxicity toward cultured cells over prolonged incubation times
up to 72 h. Therefore, the data indicate that both the PDMAEA and
the PDMAEA-siRNA polyplex were well tolerated by the tenocytes and
can be used as a safe proof-of-concept gene delivery vector. In contrast,
the obtained results demonstrated that the metabolic activity of the
cultured tenocytes was significantly hampered by all the tested concentrations
of PEI polymer, except for the dose used in transfection (0.25 μM),
which did not significantly reduce the metabolic activity compared
to PDMAEA polymer at the same concentration. However, the effect on
the metabolic activity of the PEI-siRNA polyplexes at transfection
concentration (0.25 μM) was found to be significant at 24 and
48 h of incubation times, but not at 72 h, suggesting a potential
recovery of the cultured tenocytes in longer periods of incubation.
Similar to PEI polymer, the rest of the tested PEI-siRNA polyplex
concentrations showed cytotoxic effects in the cultured tenocytes.
Therefore, the results suggest that PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes are a
good candidate for gene delivery and allow for the use of a wide range
of polymer concentrations, whereas PEI-siRNA polyplexes should be
used at lower concentrations to avoid a greater cytotoxic effect.

Next, collagen type III silencing mediated by the polyplex was
investigated. However, gene expression in tendon cells has been shown
to change with culture42,43 and can change rapidly from the
expression levels found in the native tissue.44 We, therefore, confirmed that COL3α1 expression
levels did not decline over time in culture and that the use of high
passage cells in these studies would still give applicable results.
We found that, while there was variation in COL3α1 expression at each passage, it was highly expressed in all donor
cell lines at all passages and that there is no significant difference
in COL3α1 expression at any passage between
passage 0 and passage 10 in equine tenocytes. This is in contrast
to a previous study on human tenocytes that showed that COL3α1 expression increased with passage.42 We
also demonstrate that COL1α1 levels drop significantly
between passage 0 and passage 3 but remain constant until passage
10. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that there is no significant
difference in collagen gel contraction and response to inflammation
in equine tendon cells used between passages 4 and 11.45 Therefore, although the effect on collagen knockdown
was performed in high passage cells in this current study, we believe
that the results provide an accurate in vitro model.

Ideally,
we would have chosen to use tenocytes isolated from rupture
sites that are reported in the literature to produce more collagen
type III than cells isolated from healthy tendon tissue.46 However, in the absence of suitable donor tissue,
we increased the synthesis of collagen type III using TGF-β1.47 Since this was a new experiment, we first investigated
the effect of concentration and incubation time of TGF-β1 in
cultured tenocytes. Using PCR to calculate the relative expression
of COL3α1, we were able to determine the effect
of different doses of TGF-β1. From there, we determined the
optimal concentration and length of application of TGF-β1 which
induced maximal COL3α1 gene expression. The
conditions were optimized for both PDMAEA and PEI and to allow for
direct comparisons with the PCR assays. Both polymers have an equal
amount and concentration of the therapeutic siRNA and were tested
under the same conditions.

Next, we demonstrated that the PDMAEA-siRNA
polyplex could specifically
silence COL3α1 gene expression in TGF-β1
boosted tenocyte culture conditions. As measured by PCR, the fold
change in the COL3α1 silencing effect was observed
only for the polyplex formed with the target PDMAEA-siRNA COL3α1. However, the silencing effect was more apparent
at 48 h compared to 72 h, likely since the highest induction of COL3α1 synthesis was achieved at 48 h by TGF-β1.
We also noted that PEI-siRNA polyplex mediated silencing was greatest
at 72 h. The two polymers have different transfection efficacies where
PEI achieves its greatest silencing at 72 h, but our polyplex achieves
it at 48 h without cytotoxicity, as confirmed per the MTS assay and
shown in Figure 2A,B.
Although messenger RNA analysis by qPCR has been widely used as a
tool to assess gene expression in tendon tissue engineering, future
work could benefit from protein or other analysis to provide other
quantitative methods for this study.

Conclusions
This
study provides a successful proof-of-principle that the PDMAEA
polymer can be used for delivery of siRNA to target collagen type
III overexpression with potential application in tendon injuries.
Optimizing the polyplex system can further provide a more comprehensive
understanding of this technique as a specific silencing system. For
example, the collagen type III knockdown was performed on tenocytes
derived from one individual animal, and therefore, further biological
replicates would provide greater insight into the effectiveness of
this approach. Our polyplexes are well tolerated with increased concentrations
suggesting that repeated doses might be possible. As tendon is avascular,
systematic absorption might be less favorable in comparison to direct
local injection with the aid of ultrasound scanning. Furthermore,
the effect on collagen type III silencing could be studied further
by determining the effect on COL3α1 protein
expression and localization. Additionally, determining the effect
of applying a short pulse of TGF-β1 versus a sustained exposure
and the effect of TGF-β1 over longer periods of time would provide
a deeper comprehension into the potential silencing mechanism. Further
work would be required to determine the impact on the ratio of collagen
types III and I following COL1α3 knockdown.
Following a tendon injury, there may also be an influx of cells from
outside the tendon, for example, bone-marrow-derived stromal cells.
Future work should aim to investigate whether this technology can
also be used to reduce COL1α3 expression in
such cell types. Studies on the dose duration and efficacy of uptake
can also be examined as future progress from this work. Further studies
will also investigate the development of the injectable and controlled-release
system to deliver PDMAEA-siRNA polyplex over a prolonged period of
time in order to control tendon adhesion and tissue scarring. This
could be carried out by loading or encapsulating the polyplex into
polymeric nanoparticles composed of degradable polymers, using standard
double emulsion techniques, in which the rate of the polymer degradation
can be used to tune the release profile.48

penicillin–streptomycin solution (Fisher), l-glutamine
(Fisher), HEPES (Bioreagent, 99%, Sigma), Tri Reagent solution (Invitrogen),
1-bromo-3-chloropropane (Sigma), isopropanol (Sigma), ethanol (Sigma),
and gelatine solution (Sigma) were used as received. The DNA-free
DNA Removal Kit (Thermo Fisher), High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Thermo Fisher), and SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma)
were used according to manufacturers’ guidelines. Phosphate
buffered saline tablets (PBS, Fisher Chemical) were used at 1×
concentration in ultrapure water for cell culture purposes. Ethidium
bromide was used at a concentration of 6 μg mL–1 in 1× TAE for agarose gel electrophoresis. Paraformaldehyde
(Sigma) was used at 3% concentration for immunocytochemical techniques.
Adult horse tendon cells (received at passage 7) were provided by
Dr. D. Guest (Animal Health Trust, U.K.) and were grown as monolayers
and expanded to passage 9 for the experiments. Human recombinant TGF-β1
was purchased from Peprotech.

Preparation of PDMAEA-siRNA
Polyplexes
siRNA solution
was added to a microcentrifuge tube at a final concentration of 132
μg mL–1 in HEPES buffer (100 μL, 30
mM, pH 7.4). Calculated amounts of the PDMAEA were prepared in 100
μL of HEPES buffer (30 mM, pH 7.4) and added to siRNA to form
polyplex at a N:P ratio of 10:1. The polyplex solution was diluted
to 1 mL with HEPES buffer resulting in a final siRNA concentration
of 13.2 μg mL–1 and a final PDMAEA concentration
of 0.6 mg mL–1. Solutions were mixed by vortexing
for 15 s and then allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at room temperature
before characterization.

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
PDMAEA-siRNA
polyplexes
(8 μL of the sample with 2 μL of 1× loading dye)
were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel in Tris-acetate–EDTA (TAE,
pH 8.0). Electrophoresis was performed at 80 V for 40 min in a Mini-Sub
cell system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The gel was later submerged in
0.006% ethidium bromide solution for post-cast staining for 1 hour.
Bands were visualized and photographed using a ChemiDoc-It 2810 imager
(U.V.P, USA). Data were collected and analyzed using the software
provided.

Dynamic Light Scattering
The size and dispersity of
the PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes were determined by dynamic light scattering.
1 mL of PDMAEA-siRNA polyplex (prepared in 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) was
added to a cuvette, and the samples were examined using a Zetasizer
Nano ZS (Malvern, U.K.) equipped with a He-Ne laser (4 mW, 633 nm).
The measurement angle was set at 173° backscattered. The size
distribution of the scattering polyplexes was determined and reported
as average light intensity, volume, and number of polyplexes.

Surface
Charge Measurement (Zeta Potential)
The surface
charge of the PDMAEA-siRNA polyplexes was measured by a Zetasizer
Nano ZS (Malvern, U.K.) using a DTS 1060 folded capillary cells. The
measurements were recorded in 10 mM HEPES buffer solution at pH 5.5,
6.5, and 7.4. The zeta potential measurements are reported as mean
value ± standard deviation from three measurements of at least
20 runs per measurement.

Cells Metabolic Activity Assay
Adult
equine tendon
cells were isolated, as described previously,49 from healthy adult horse tendons with the approval of the Animal
Health Trust Ethical Review Committee (AHT_02_2012). These cells were
analyzed previously for their gene and protein expression,45,49 ability to contract a collagen gel,50 and the effect of gene knockdown.51 Tendon
cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (PS). All
cell cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells at passage 9 were seeded at
10000 cells/0.32 cm2 (96-well plates) and allowed to adhere
for 24 h before the experiment began. The PDMAEA or PEI-siRNA polyplexes
were freshly prepared as described previously at different concentrations
of the PDMAEA or PEI polymer, ranging from 0.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, and 50 μM. The polymer and polyplexes were incubated
for 24, 48, and 72 h. To analyze the metabolic activity of the equine
tenocytes, 10% MTS reagent was used according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. After 1 h of incubation, the absorbance was read at 490
nm in a microplate reader (Omega). For PEI containing samples, the
supernatant was removed and transferred to a fresh plate before absorbance
was read. All the data are presented as a percentage of cell metabolic
activity compared to non-treated cells.

Collagen Type III Expression
Level in Serial Passages of Equine
Tendon Cells
Three independent tendon cell lines were cultured
from three different horses and RNA extracted at every passage to
determine the expression of COL1α1 and COL3α1 using qPCR.

TGF-β1 Treatment
Adult equine tendon cells (passages
7–9) were cultured in six-well plates at a density of 600000
cells/9.6 cm2. To determine the optimal stimulation dose
of TGF-β1 for collagen type III upregulation, different concentrations
(0.5, 1, 10, and 25 ng mL–1) were prepared in PBS
(1×) containing 0.1% BSA and added to the cell culture medium.
Cells were then incubated for 24 h prior to harvesting, and COL3α1 levels were analyzed by qPCR. For transfection
efficiency analysis, cells were cultured in the same conditions as
described previously but using 10 ng mL–1 concentration
of TGF-β1. Cells were then harvested after 24, 48, and 72 h,
and COL3α1 levels were analyzed by qPCR.

RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis
Adult equine tenocytes
were directly lysed with 1 mL of Tri-reagent per well according to
the manufacturer’s protocol and preserved at −80 °C
until analysis. After thawing, 100 μL of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane
were added to each sample. After gently shaking, the tubes were incubated
at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C for
20 min, in order to separate the RNA to the aqueous phase, which was
then transferred to fresh tubes. 500 μL of isopropanol was added
to each tube, vortexed, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.
Tubes were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant
was discarded. RNA pellets were washed with 1 mL of 70% ethanol. After
centrifugation at 4 °C, ethanol was discarded, and pellets were
left to dry in air for 10 min before solubilizing the RNA in 20 μL
of nuclease-free water. RNA was then treated with Ambion DNA-free
DNA Removal Kit (Life Technologies, Paisley, U.K.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA purity was assessed using
a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). RNA samples with
values below 1.8 at a ratio of 260/280 were excluded. First-strand
complementary DNA (cDNA) was made from 1 μg of RNA using High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit on a PTC-100 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad)
using the following protocol: 10 min at 25 °C, 120 min at 37
°C, and 5 min at 85 °C. 200 ng of synthesized cDNA in a
20 μL reaction volume was used in a quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qRT PCR).

Quantitative PCR
Primer sequences
used in the qPCR
are reported as follows: 18S rRNA gene forward CCCAGTGAGAATGCCCTCTA,
reverse TGGCTGAGCAAGGTGTTATG; COL3α1 gene forward
CTGGTGCTAATGGTGCTCCT, reverse TCTCCTTTGGCACCATTCTT. Synthesized cDNA
was amplified using an SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix master mix,
and qPCRs were performed on a Rotor-Gene Q 2plex Platform (Qiagen).
All qPCR reactions were performed in duplicate. PCR cycle conditions
were set as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min
followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 15
s. At the end of the program, the temperature was reduced to 60 °C
and then gradually increased by 1 °C increments up to 95 °C
to produce a melt curve. Gene expression was normalized to the 18S
rRNA gene expression levels using the threshold cycle (Ct) –
relative quantification method (2–ΔΔCt). The Ct values of the 18S gene did not change between the control
and treated samples. Data are presented as a fold change compared
to unstimulated cells. In all reactions, a standard curve including
five dilutions of known cDNA was generated to ensure highly efficient
product amplification. R2 of all reactions
was 0.98–0.99.

PDMAEA-siRNA Transfection of Equine Tenocytes
Adult
equine tenocytes were seeded into six-well plates at a density of
600000 cells/9.6 cm2 and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cell
culture media were then supplemented with TGF-β1 at 10 ng mL–1 concentration for 24 h. The PDMAEA-siRNA polyplex
was prepared as described before and added to the wells to achieve
a final siRNA concentration of 50 nM (this equals to 4.5 μM
polyplex concentration). Cells were then harvested, RNA was extracted,
and COL3α1 and 18S mRNA levels were analyzed
by qRT PCR. Control cells with no TGF-β1 and cells treated with
PDMAEA-siRNA random were used as a negative control, whereas PEI-siRNA
was used as a positive control. All experiments were performed in
duplicate.
