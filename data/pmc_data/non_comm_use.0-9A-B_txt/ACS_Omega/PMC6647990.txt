A novel
method whose starting materials was Fe–P waste slag and CO2 using a closed-loop carbon and energy cycle to synthesize
LiFePO4/C materials was proposed recently. In the first
step, Fe–P slag was calcinated in a CO2 atmosphere
to manufacture Fe3(PO4)2, in which
the solid products were tested by XRD (X-ray diffraction) analysis
and the gaseous products were analyzed by the gas detection method.
In the second step, as-synthesized Fe3(PO4)2 was further used as the Fe and P source to manufacture LiFePO4/C materials. Also, the influence of the preparation conditions
of Fe3(PO4)2, including calcination
time and calcination temperature, on the energy storage properties
of as-obtained LiFePO4/C was investigated. It was found
that the LiFePO4/C materials, which was synthesized from
Fe3(PO4)2 obtained by calcining Fe–P
waste slag at 800 °C for 10 h in CO2,
exhibited a higher capacity, better reversibility, and lower polarization
than other samples. The discharge capacity of as-obtained LiFePO4/C can reach 145 mAh/g at 0.1 C current rate. This work puts
forward an environment-friendly method of manufacturing LiFePO4/C cathode materials, which has a closed-loop carbon and energy
cycle.

1 Introduction
Since lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) was reported
as a novel cathode material for lithium ion battery (Li-ion battery)
by Padhi et al., it has been intensively studied during the past decade.1 Due to its high theoretical specific capacity
(170 mAh/g) and environmental friendliness,2−4 LiFePO4 has been one of the most
widely used cathode materials for Li-ion battery powering electric
vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, aerospace devices, and military
devices. Until now, LiFePO4 was mainly synthesized by the
method of solution phase or solid phase. Solution-phase methods, including
sol–gel method,5 solvothermal method,6 emulsion drying method, co-precipitation method,7,8 etc., was not perfect for large-scale industrial production because
of its dependence and complicated preparation route. In contrast,
the solid-phase synthesis methods were feasible and straightforward
when compared to the solution method. Generally, ferrous compounds,
such as FeC2O4·2H2O, Fe2O3, or FePO4,9 are mainly used as raw materials to synthesize LiFePO4. However, Fe(III) in FePO4 has to be reduced to Fe(II)
for the manufacturing of LiFePO4, which will complicate
the roasting process. Also, as the commercialization of LiFePO4, the prices of FePO4 has been rising steadily.10 Other Fe(II) compounds such as FeC2O4·2H2O and Fe(CH3COO)2 are not only expensive but also toxic, which make it an inconvenience
for producing LiFePO4. Therefore, Fe3(PO4)2 is a promising alternative Fe and P source for
LiFePO4 production.11

Fe–P waste slag was a solid waste sourced from the yellow
phosphorus industry, which is an important chemical industry, especially
in western China.12,13 In the traditional industry,
Fe–P waste slag cannot be efficiently utilized to manufacture
other products, while it was commonly used as a low-quality resource
for the steel-making industry. It is urgent to develop a novel method
to make both Fe and P in Fe–P slag comprehensively utilized,
which can benefit both the environment and the related industry. As
for the yellow phosphorus industry, about 150 kg of Fe–P slags
will be generated for manufacturing 1 ton of yellow phosphorus. Therefore,
Fe–P slag is of low cost (no more than $500/ton,) and a huge
production (more than 140,000 tons per year in western China) resource
in western China.12,13 In our previous research, Fe–P
slag was determined as Fe1.5P, which can be treated as
a mixture of FeP and Fe2P.10 Also, CO2 is a conventional waste gas, which is gradually
accumulating in air and considered as the primary greenhouse gas.14,15 In recent years, both chemical and electrochemical methods were
reported to transfer CO2 to other chemicals, which show
great potential to reduce the CO2 concentration in air.
However, almost all the method faces huge cost problems for practical
applications.16,17

In our previous research,
we have demonstrated that Fe–P waste slag can react with Li2CO3 and H3PO4 under a CO2 atmosphere to generate LiFePO4.13 However, the chemical mechanism insight of this process
is unclear. In this work, we develop a two-step method, inspired by
our previous work, of synthesizing LiFePO4. At first, Fe–P
slag was calcined under a CO2 atmosphere for producing
Fe3(PO4)2. In the second step, as-synthesized
Fe3(PO4)2 is further used as the
Fe and P source for synthesizing LiFePO4. Also, the CO
gas, generated in this step, is determined by a home-made online CO
detection system. Finally, we found that this two-step method has
a closed-loop carbon and energy cycle, while the CO gas generated
in the first step is enough to be used as a fuel in the second step.
Also, CO2, as the gaseous product in the second step, can
feedback to the first step as the gaseous reactant.

2 Results and Discussion
Initial
experiments were carried out by calcining Fe–P slag under a
CO2 atmosphere to study the reaction between Fe1.5P and CO2. In this test, Fe1.5P powder was
respectively calcined at 750, 800, 850, and 900 °C for 10 h under a CO2 atmosphere, and the as-obtained
solid products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
The XRD patterns of the as-obtained products are shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1a, Fe–P waste
slag was composed of FeP and Fe2P, which was also confirmed
in our previous research.10 There were
three diffraction peaks appeared when the roasting temperature increased
to 750 °C, which agreed well with standard diffraction
peaks of Fe3(PO4)2 (JPCDS no, 49-1087).13 This indicates that Fe1.5P can be
oxidized to Fe3(PO4)2 by CO2 with a temperature above 750 °C. The typical diffraction
peaks of Fe3(PO4)2 centered at 2θ
≈ 29.5°, 30.7°, and 42.0°, and their peak intensities
increase, whereas those of Fe2P and FeP decrease while
increasing the calcining temperature. When the calcining temperature
is above 850 °C, the solid products did not show
any other diffraction peaks except that of Fe3(PO4)2, indicating that Fe3(PO4)2 is the only solid product for this reaction in the test condition.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the solid products from roasting Fe–P
slag under a CO2 atmosphere with (a) different calcination
temperatures and (b) different calcination times.

Furthermore, Fe1.5P powder was calcined at 800 °C
for 5, 10, and 15 h in a CO2 atmosphere, and the XRD patterns
of the as-obtained solid products are shown in Figure 1b. Herein, the as-obtained solid products
were respectively labeled as FP800°C5h, FP800°C10h, and
FP800°C15h. It was shown that FP800°C5h exhibited the typical
diffraction peaks of Fe3(PO4)2 (JPCDS
#49-1087). Also, there were typical peaks attributed to Fe2P, while peaks for FeP were not identified, indicating that FeP was
entirely consumed by CO2 in the first 5 h, but Fe2P was not. As the calcination time extends to 10 and 15 h, the peak
intensity of Fe3(PO4)2 increase obviously,
while that of Fe2P decrease dramatically, implying that
Fe2P reacted with CO2 and generated Fe3(PO4)2.

A home-made online gaseous detection
system determined the gaseous product for the reaction between Fe–P
slag and CO2. The schematic diagram of this online CO testing
system is illustrated in Figure 2a. In this test, a coil heat exchanger was employed
to cool down the outlet gas from the tube furnace followed by flowing
it into a CO sensor with a resolution of 0.5 ppm (Membrapor, Switzerland).
In this test, Fe1.5P powder was roasted in a CO2 flow (200 mL/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature
to 900 °C with a slope of 10 °C/min. Also, the temperature
compensation of this system was carried out with an empty sample crucible,
which is shown in Figure S1. The CO concentration
in off-gas was tested, and its concentration is shown in Figure 2b. It was shown that
CO liberation started with a temperature of about 600 °C, which
indicated that the reaction between Fe–P slag and CO2 was started at about 600 °C. As the rising of roasting temperature,
the CO concentration increased dramatically to about 4500 ppm with
a temperature of about 700–80 °C, indicating that the
reaction between Fe–P slag and CO2 got a fast reaction
stage in this temperature range. As the consumption of Fe–P
slag, the CO concentration decreased dramatically to about 0 ppm at
900 °C. According to this result, it is safe to conclude that
CO was generated from the reaction between Fe1.5P and CO2, while this reaction can be started at about 600 °C
and got to a fast reaction stage after 700 °C.

According
to the above product analysis for this reaction, its solid product
and gaseous product were Fe3(PO4)2 and CO, respectively. Basically, the overall reaction equation was
proposed based on the analysis of products for this reaction between
Fe1.5P and CO2, while the reaction equation
was shown as 1  

As shown in
this equation, Fe1.5P was oxidized to Fe3(PO4)2 by CO2 under the testing condition,
as CO2 was reduced to CO at the same time. This is the
general chemistry for preparing Fe3(PO4)2 in this method.

In this work, Fe3(PO4)2 was further used as the iron and phosphorus
source for manufacturing LiFePO4. As for the preparation
of LiFePO4/C, Li2CO3 was used as
the lithium source, while H3PO4 was used as
the phosphorus source to make up the content difference of iron and
phosphorus in Fe3(PO4)2. In this
work, Fe3(PO4)2 with different roasting
temperatures and roasting times was used for the preparation of LiFePO4/C. The XRD patterns of the LiFePO4 synthesized
are shown in Figure 3a. Herein, as-synthesized LiFePO4 was labeled as LFP-FP750°C10h,
LFP-FP800°C10h, LFP-FP850°C10h, and LFP-FP900°C10h,
corresponding to their Fe3(PO4)2 precursors
manufactured by calcining at 750, 800, 850, and 900 °C, respectively.
The XRD patterns of LiFePO4/C obtained from Fe3(PO4)2 prepared with different calcination
times are shown in Figure 3b. Also, the LiFePO4/C samples obtained from Fe3(PO4)2 precursors prepared with different
calcination times were labeled as LFP-FP800°C5h, LFP-FP800°C10h,
and LFP-FP800°C15h. As shown in Figure 3, all of the indexed peaks match well with
the standard peaks of LiFePO4 (JPCDS #40-1499),10 indicating that the as-prepared samples were
orthorhombic LiFePO4 crystals.

of LiFePO4/C synthesized
from Fe3(PO4)2 prepared at (a) different
temperatures and (b) different calcination times.

Therefore, the possible
chemical reaction occurred in the synthesizing of LiFePO4 could be reasonably described as 2  

As shown in this reaction equation, this reaction released
CO2 and H2O from the decomposition of Li2CO3 and H3PO4. Also, glucose
was used as the carbon source in this experiment, which is the most
commonly used cheap and effective carbon source for LiFePO4.18 Therefore, the LiFePO4 samples
obtained in this work were labeled as LiFePO4/C.

Further, the average grain sizes of the as-obtained LiFePO4/C samples were calculated using Scherrer’s formula,19 and the results are shown in Tables S1 and S2. The average grain sizes of the as-prepared
LiFePO4/C samples arranged from 50 to 70 nm and have a
larger crystal size when roasting with a longer calcination time or
a higher calcination temperature.

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of both Fe3(PO4)2 and
LiFePO4/C are shown in Figure 4. The Fe3(PO4)2 samples,
including FP800°C10h, FP800°C15h, and FP900°C10h, are
shown in Figure 4(a-1),
(b-1), and (c-1), respectively, while the corresponding LiFePO4/C
samples, including LFP-FP800°C10h, LFP-FP800°C15h and LFP-FP900°C10h,
are given in Figure 4(a-2), (b-2), and (c-2), respectively. As shown in Figure 4, all the Fe3(PO4)2 and LiFePO4/C samples showed an irregular
shape, and their particle dimension arranged from several micrometers
to decades
of micrometers. Besides, it was found that the smaller particle size
Fe3(PO4)2 generated the smaller particle
size LiFePO4/C product, while there was no apparent agglomeration
that occurred in the synthesis of LiFePO4/C from Fe3(PO4)2. Also, the particle size of FP900°C10h
was relatively bigger than that of FP800°C10h, indicating that
increasing the calcination temperature can increase the sample size.

and (c-2) LFP-FP900°C10h.

Further, the influence of the preparing condition for Fe3(PO4)2 on the energy storage properties of
the corresponding LiFePO4/C was studied using a galvanostatic
charge/discharge test, cyclic voltammograms, and EIS measurements,
and the results are shown in Figure 5a–f.

charge/discharge curves, (b)
CV curves, and (c) EIS plots of LFP-FP750°C10h, LFP-FP800°C10h,
LFP-FP850°C10h, and LFP-FP900°C10h. (d) Galvanostatic charge/discharge
curves, (e) CV curves, and (f) EIS plots of LFP-FP800°C5h, LFP-FP800°C10h,
and LFP-FP800°C10h.

The galvanostatic charge/discharge
curves of the LiFePO4/C samples are shown in Figure 5a. This test was performed
in the voltage range of 2.4–4.2 V at 0.1 C rate. All the curves
exhibit a similarly steady charge plateau at ∼3.44 V and a
discharge plateau at ∼3.41 V, which correspond to the extraction
and insertion of Li ion in LiFePO4, respectively. As shown
in Figure 5a, the discharge
capacities of LiFePO4/C depended on the calcination temperatures
for manufacturing Fe3(PO4)2. The
initial discharge capacities of LFP-FP750°C10h, LFP-FP800°C10h,
LFP-FP850°C10h, and LFP-FP900°C10h were 93, 145, 108, and
104 mAh/g, while the corresponding Coulombic efficiencies were 88,
95, 88, and 86%, respectively. This noted that the sample from 800
°C calcination delivered both maximum discharge capacity and
Coulombic efficiency among all the samples. The galvanostatic charge/discharge
curves of as-synthesized LiFePO4/C from Fe3(PO4)2 with different calcination times are shown in Figure 5d. The initial discharge
capacities of LFP-FP800°C5h, LFP-FP800°C10h, and LFP-FP800°C15h
at 0.1 C are 92, 145, and 122 mAh/g, and the corresponding Coulombic
efficiencies are 91, 95, and 91%, respectively. This noted that the
sample with 10 h calcination time delivered higher capacity and Coulombic
efficiency than other samples. The cycle performance of the sample
LFP-FP800°C10h at 0.1 C current rate was subsequently investigated
as given in Figure S2. After 25 cycles
at 0.1 C rate, the capacity retention ratio remains at about 97%,
indicating that the LFP-FP800°C10h sample has a distinguish reversibility.
Also, according to the XRD and SEM experimental results discussed
above, the LFP-FP800°C10h sample has a smaller average grain
size, which may benefit the transportation of Li ion. Also, an appropriate
degree of crystallinity is another critical factor that influences
the capacity of LiFePO4. In this method, the LFP-FP800°C10h
sample showed the optimized capacity under the influence comprehensively
by both factors.

The cyclic voltammograms of as-synthesized
LiFePO4/C, from Fe3(PO4)2 precursors prepared with different calcination temperatures and
calcination times, performed at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s are given
in Figure 5b,e, respectively.
One pair of symmetric oxidation/reduction peaks in each CV curve indicates
that as-synthesized LiFePO4/C has a reversible two-phase
reaction between LiFePO4 and FePO4. The oxidation
and reduction peaks refer to Li-ion extraction from LiFePO4 and insertion into FePO4, respectively. The oxidation
potential (EO), reduction potential (ER), separation of redox peak potentials (ΔE), oxidation peak current (IO), and reduction peak current (IR) are
summarized in Tables S3 and S4. It is shown
that ΔE of as-synthesized LiFePO4/C increases as the calcination temperature and calcination time
increases.
Also, the peak current intensity decreases with longer calcination
time for synthesizing Fe3(PO4)2.
By considering the particle dimension distribution analysis, it was
inferred that the larger LiFePO4/C particle size would
be detrimental to the transportation of lithium ion in the cathode,
while the larger particle size was caused by longer calcination time
and calcination temperature in the synthesis of Fe3(PO4)2.

The Nyquist plots of as-synthesized LiFePO4/C, from Fe3(PO4)2 prepared
with different calcination temperatures and calcination times, and
its equivalent circuit are shown in Figure 5c,f. All curves exhibit a similar shape with
a depressed semicircle in the high-to-medium frequency region and
an oblique line in the low-frequency region. The EIS curves were fitted
using the R(QR)(Q(RW)) model provided by the ZsimpWin software. The
constant phase element (CPE) is defined as Q to substitute
for capacitance if taking the nonhomogeneity, such as porosity, roughness,
and geometry, in the system into account.10,20Rs, Rct, W, Rf, Qd, and Qf refer to the ohmic resistance
of the electrolyte, charge-transfer resistance, Warburg impedance,
and the resistance of the solid electrolyte film (SEI), constant phase
element of the film, and the electrolyte film/electrode interface,
respectively. The simulated results of Rct, W, Rf, Qd, and Qf are summarized in Tables S5 and S6. The charge-transfer reaction
impendence Rct of LFP-FP800°C10h
has the lowest value among the obtained samples; however, the Warburg
impedance W of that is the highest one, implying
that LFP-FP800°C10h has fast electrode reaction kinetics but
a low lithium diffusion rate in the bulk electrode. Rct and W show the smallest value for
the LFP-FP800°C10h sample, indicating that it has a better dynamics
property than other samples. As a result, the LiFePO4/C
sample from Fe3(PO4)2 obtained by
calcinating Fe1.5P powder at 800 °C for 10 h in a
CO2 atmosphere, exhibits preferable electrochemical performances
including high charge/discharge capacity, low polarization degree,
and fast electrode reaction kinetics.

Based on this work, an
environment-friendly method of manufacturing LiFePO4 is
put forward using Fe–P and CO2, and this is described
as flowing steps. The schematic description of the preparation process
is illustrated in Figure 6. At first, an airslide disintegrating mill was employed to
pulverize Fe–P waste slag to a 2000 mesh size. The powdered
Fe–P slag from the mills was carried to the rotary kiln, and
Fe–P powder was calcined in a CO2 atmosphere at
800 °C for 10 h to manufacture Fe3(PO4)2. The Fe3(PO4)2 manufactured
in the first step was further ball milled with H3PO4/Li2CO3 in a molar ratio of 1:1:1.5,
and another 10 wt % glucose was added as the carbon source. The mixture
was calcined at 700 °C for 6 h in an Ar atmosphere in a furnace,
and the final product LiFePO4/C was subsequently obtained.

Figure 6 Schematic description
of the method for preparing
LiFePO4/C.

Fe–P slag used in this method was a widespread waste slag
in western China. Through this method, Fe–P slag can be utilized
for manufacturing the high value-added LiFePO4/C. Furthermore,
the CO2 gas, generated in the second step, can be used
as a reaction gas in the first step. Also, the CO gas generated in
the first step can be collected and used as a fuel for this process.
It gives this method an environmentally friendly and high value-added
property.

In this work, CO2 was utilized as a reactant,
while it was reduced to CO in the synthesis of Fe3(PO4)2. However, the CO gas in the obtained gaseous products can
be used as a fuel for the next step of manufacturing LiFePO4. Also, its combustion product is CO2, which can be feedback
to the first step as the reactant gas. In the reaction of the synthesis
of Fe3(PO4)2, every kilogram of Fe–P
slag will consume about 779 m3 of CO2 and generate
about 779 m3 of CO, which can be collected using gas separation
technology and feedback to oxidize Fe–P slag in the first step.
The detailed calculation process was given as below. The volume of
CO generated in the synthesis of Fe3(PO4)2 was first calculated. As for the reaction showed as formulation
3, for 1 kg of Fe–P slag, the volume of CO generated in this
reaction was calculated as  In which, VCO is the volume of CO generated
in this method for 1 kg of Fe–P slag. MFe1.5P is the relative molecular mass of Fe1.5P (115 g/mol). According to formulation 3, the volume of CO generated
in this reaction is equal to that of CO2 as the reactant
gas. Therefore, about 779.1 m3 CO2 will be consumed
for the synthesis of Fe3(PO4)2, and
it will generate 779.1 m3 of CO at the same time. Considering
that the combustion heat of CO is 12.64 MJ/m3, the overall
combustion heat for 779.1 m3 CO (QCO) was calculated as  

This design can make carbon dioxides
circulate in a closed-loop carbon cycle of this industry process.
This closed-loop carbon cycle can effectively reduce CO2 emissions and give this method an environmental characteristic,
avoiding the massive emissions of CO2. By considering that
the combustion heat of CO was 12.64 MJ/m3, the CO gas generated
in the first step can generate 9846.6 MJ heat for 1 kg of Fe1.5P. The corresponding thermodynamic parameters and calculation process
are given in the Supporting Information. This amount of energy can be used in the next step to synthesize
the LiFePO4/C composite. It was estimated that this amount
of CO generated in the first step was enough to drive the reaction
in the second step. Therefore, this built a closed-loop energy cycle
for this method, as shown in Figure 6. This design supplies a green strategy for manufacturing
Fe3(PO4)2 and LiFePO4.

In this
method, all the Fe and P from Fe–P slag was fully utilized
for manufacturing LiFePO4, which provided a new way for
the multipurpose use of Fe–P waste slag. Also, the CO gas generated
in the first step can be used as a fuel in the second step. Also,
CO2, as the gaseous product in the second step, can feedback
to the first step as the gaseous reactant. Therefore, it avoided massive
emissions of CO2. Due to this closed-loop carbon cycle
and energy cycle, this method has environmentally friendly property,
which can significantly reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emission.

3 Conclusions
A novel method with a closed-loop carbon and energy cycle was proposed
to synthesize LiFePO4/C materials for Li-ion batteries.
At first, Fe3(PO4)2 was synthesized
by calcining Fe–P slag in a CO2 atmosphere followed
by as-obtained Fe3(PO4)2 reacting
with Li2CO3 and H3PO4 for
synthesizing LiFePO4/C cathode materials. Further, it was
found that LiFePO4/C materials, synthesized from the Fe3(PO4)2 obtained by calcining Fe–P
waste slag at 800 °C for 10 h in a CO2 atmosphere,
exhibited a high capacity (145 mAh/g at 0.1 C rate), good reversibility,
and low polarization degree. In this method, the CO gas generated
in synthesizing Fe3(PO4)2 can be used as a fuel
in the second step. While its combustion product, CO2,
can be feedback to the first step as the reactant gas. It formed a
closed-loop carbon and energy cycle, which can dramatically reduce
the energy consumption and CO2 emission for this method.
This work puts forward an environment-friendly method for manufacturing
LiFePO4/C cathode materials, which can remarkably reduce
its energy consumption and CO2 emission.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Methods
Fe–P waste
slag used throughout this work was previously determined as a mixture
of FeP and Fe2P, which is denoted as Fe1.5P
for simplification in this paper.10 Fe1.5P (∼98.0%) powder was first calcined
in a CO2 atmosphere at 750–900 °C for 5–15 h to synthesize Fe3(PO4)2, which was further used as the Fe and P source in the next
step for manufacturing LiFePO4. As-synthesized Fe3(PO4)2 was mixed with H3PO4 (∼85%)/Li2CO3 (∼99.6%) in a molar ratio of 1:1:1.5, and 10 wt % glucose was added
as the carbon resource. The mixture was ball milled using ethanol
as the dispersing agent to form a rheological phase. After being dried,
the mixture was calcined at 700 °C for 6 h in a quartz tube furnace
flushed by argon to manufacture LiFePO4/C. As for the tail
gas treatment for this work, a mixture of CO2 and CO was
separated using a method of alkali absorption, and as-obtained CO
was collected and centralized treated in a torch.

4.2 Characterization
The
phase structures of as-synthesized Fe3(PO4)2 and LiFePO4/C were tested by X-ray diffraction
analysis (XRD, Philips X’Pert Pro, Holland) with a step of
0.04° s–1 in the range of 10–80°
using Cu Kα radiation at the power of 40 kV × 40 mA. The
morphologies and particle sizes were observed using a scanning electron
microscope (JSM-7500F, Japan).

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical performances
of as-synthesized LiFePO4/C were investigated as the cathode
material for Li-ion batteries using 2032-type coin cells. The galvanostatic
charge/discharge test, cyclic voltammetric (CV) test, and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were used to analyze the
electrochemical properties of the as-synthesized LiFePO4/C materials. For preparing the LiFePO4/C electrode, the
as-synthesized LiFePO4/C materials were well mixed and
ground with 10 wt % conductive acetylene black and 7 wt % commercial
LA132 binder (Chengdu Indigo Power Source Co. Ltd., China), and then
the mixture was coated on washed aluminum foil. After being dried
in vacuum at 100 °C for 10 h, the coated foil was subsequently
cut into round wafers as the working electrode. Metal lithium was
applied as both the reference electrode and the counter electrode.
A Celgard 2300 microporous polyethylene membrane was employed as the
separator, and the electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved
in the mixed solution of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate
(DMC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 by volume, Shenzhen
Capchen Chemicals Co. Ltd., China). CR2025-type coin cells were assembled
in an argon-filled glove box. Galvanonstaic charge/discharge measurements
were performed in the range of 2.4 to 4.2 V versus Li+/Li
at room temperature on a Neware battery-testing instrument (Shenzhen
Neware Tech-144 nology Ltd., China). EIS and CV measurements were
carried out using an electrochemical workstation controlled by the
Powersuit software (Princeton Applied Research, USA). The EIS analysis
was performed in a frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz with an
amplitude of 5 mV, and the CV measurements proceeded between 2.4 and
4.2 V.
