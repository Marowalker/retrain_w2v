Pure and Eu3+-doped zinc
sulfide (ZnS) crystallites
were synthesized through a hydrothermal method using water and ethanol
(W/E) as the solvent. The powder samples have been characterized systematically
using a number of characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, photoluminescence
spectroscopy, and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The band
gap of ZnS and ZnS/xEu3+ was calculated
according to absorption spectroscopy, and an obvious red shift with
the increasing molar fraction of Eu3+-doped ions was found.
The luminescent mechanism of ZnS was explored by measuring the emission
spectra of ZnS with different ratios of Zn and S. The emission spectra
of ZnS/xEu3+ included the characteristic
emission peak of ZnS and Eu3+ ions. The CIE chromaticity
coordinates of the ZnS/xEu3+ sample varied
with the molar fraction of Eu3+ ions. The emission intensity
and morphology changed with the ratio of W/E in the process of hydrothermal
reaction. The results indicate that the luminescence of the ZnS crystallite
can be modulated by doping a certain amount of Eu3+ ions,
changing the ratio of Zn and S, or adding moderate ethanol as the
reaction medium.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, as one of the representative II–VI group
semiconductors, zinc sulfide (ZnS) with a wide band gap of 3.6 eV
has been used as an attractive material for a UV–blue semiconductor
laser device or quantum dot light-emitting devices.1,2 Compared
with CdS and CdSe, ZnS has a lower toxicity and better biocompatibility,
which causes broad applications in a biological fluorescence detection
field.3 Besides, ZnS is also a kind of
luminescence material and could produce different emissions corresponding
to defect levels. Because of the various interface structures and
larger specific surface areas of ZnS, there exist a lot of dangling
bands and defects in the surface. Actually, emissions rooting from
the recombination of electron–hole pairs are few and mainly
occur at the defect in the lattice.

There are two kinds of methods
for the preparation of ZnS materials
including oil-phase and aqueous-phase method, which leads to different
features of the obtained nanoparticles.4,5 The crystallite
material obtained by the oil-phase method has high quantum yield,
narrow half-peak width, controllable particle size, good monodispersity,
and stability. However, the process of its preparation is highly toxic,
costly, and dangerous. The aqueous-phase method is environmentally
friendly owing to its use of water as the solvent and inorganic salt
as the reaction precursor. Therefore, the operation is simple, and
the reagent is nontoxic and cheap. As one of the aqueous-phase methods,
the hydrothermal method is wildly used, and the obtained crystal has
high purity and good dispersion. Its advantage follows from higher
stability, and the process itself is fast and requires only a low
thermal supply. Recently, there have been a series of reports about
ZnS materials synthesized by the hydrothermal method, and the results
are satisfactory.6−8

When ZnS is doped with different impurities
such as transition-metal
elements and rare-earth (RE) elements, it can also achieve in the
region of visible and near-infrared fluorescence because of the production
of new energy level. Moreover, the doped materials have unique electric
and magnetic properties and could be used in many fields. The study
of transition-metal element doping is relatively mature, and its luminescence
property has been improved in intensity and color and so forth.9,10 Because of the similar charge and ionic radius of Zn2+ ions and transition-metal ions, the doped ions could enter the lattice
of ZnS easily. Compared with the common element, RE has more electronic
energy levels, spectral line, and longer excited-state lifetime. In
the same way, RE doping in ZnS could add a new energy level between
the valence and conduction bands, and their characteristic peaks would
appear in the spectra, which could produce a new color after combining
with the ZnS emission. Therefore, nanomaterials doped with RE have
been viewed as a promising candidate for fabricating a new type of
light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Nowadays, there are a lot of reports
concerning the preparation and properties of the doped ZnS nanoparticles
by the hydrothermal method, and most of the doping ions are transition-metal
ions such as Mn2+, Cu2+, and Co2+.11−16 Certainly, there exist a series of reports about RE doping such
as Eu3+, Gd3+, Pr3+, and so on, which
are worth our consideration.17−19 Also, among the REs, Eu3+ is a common red-light activator because of its simplest energy-level
structure and excellent emission at the red region and thus becomes
a preferred candidate for red-emitting materials. However, there is
little investigation on the Eu3+-ion-doped ZnS by the hydrothermal
method.

In this paper, we employed a hydrothermal route to synthesize
ZnS/xEu3+ crystallite. The obtained crystallite
showed
pure cubic phase and was spherical and monodispersed, and the emission
spectra were rooted from the transition of 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, and 5D0 → 7F4 of Eu3+, which could indicate that
the Eu3+ ions enter into the lattice of the ZnS crystallite
preliminarily.

2 Results and Discussion
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared
ZnS crystallite are shown in Figure 1, in which the diffraction peaks are in well agreement
with the standard JCPDS card no. 05-0566. The main diffraction peaks
are located at 2θ = 28.56°, 47.52°, and 56.29°
corresponding to the reflection from (111), (220), and (311) planes,
respectively, which confirms the cubic zinc blende ZnS crystals. No
impurity peaks were detected, revealing the single-phase ZnS products.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of ZnS.

Figure 2 depicts
the UV absorption spectrum of the ZnS crystallite, and we could find
that the absorption region is from 300 to 400 nm and the direct band
gap energy (Eg) was approximated from
a Tauc plot, that is, a plot of (αhν)1/2 versus photon energy (hν), using
the relationship20 1  where hν is the photon
energy, A is a constant, α represents the absorption
coefficient, α = 4πk/λ (k is the absorption index), λ is the wavelength, and n = 1/2 for the allowed direct band gap. It can be clearly
seen from the inset that the direct band gap value is 3.452 eV by
extrapolating the absorption edge of ZnS.

Figure 2 UV–vis absorption
spectrum of ZnS.

The excitation and emission
spectra of the ZnS sample are given
in Figure 3. As shown
in this figure, all of the emission spectra have two peaks at around
483 and 586 nm, which could be ascribed from a trap-state emission
arising from surface defect sites.21 The
intensities of the two peaks vary from different excitation wavelengths,
and the ratio of their intensities is shown in the inset. In addition,
the excitation spectra monitored for 483 nm are composed of a main
peak located at 347 nm and a shoulder peak at 360 nm, whereas the
excitation spectrum monitored for 586 nm has three peaks at 309, 337,
and 400 nm. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the emission dominates at 483 nm when the excitation
wavelengths are 309 and 400 nm. However, the relative intensity of
the peak at 586 nm is stronger when the ZnS sample is excited by 337,
347, and 360 nm light. The results indicated that the emission peaks
at 483 and 586 nm correspond to different defects.

Figure 3 Excitation and emission
spectra of ZnS.

To explore the luminescence
mechanism, a series of ZnS samples
with different values of Zn/S have been synthesized, and their XRD
patterns are shown in Figure 4. The three main diffraction peaks of the samples with Zn/S
= 1.5:1 and 1:1.5 are coincident with the JCPDS card no. 05-0566,
which reveals that the cubic zinc blend structure of the ZnS crystallite
could be obtained even when the ratio of Zn and S is adjusted in the
fabrication process.

Figure 4 XRD patterns of ZnS with different ratios of Zn/S.

The emission spectra excited at
400 nm of ZnS samples with different
values of Zn/S are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the shape of the emission spectra
changes considerably when the ratio varies from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5. The
peak at the orange region is observed at 608 nm resulting from the
red shift of 586 nm, and the peak located at 498 nm is shifted from
483 nm. When the ratio is 1.5:1, Zn is relatively excessive so that
the sulfur vacancy dominate on the surface, which results in a stronger
peak at 498 nm, whereas when the ratio is 1:1.5, S is excessive and
the zinc vacancy is much more than the sulfur vacancy, which leads
to a stronger peak at 608 nm. Therefore, we could conclude that the
peak located at 498 nm (483 nm) belongs to the transition of sulfur
vacancy, whereas the peak at around 608 nm (586 nm) belongs to the
transition of zinc vacancy.

Figure 5 Excitation and emission spectra of ZnS with
different ratios of
Zn/S.

The decay behaviors of the ZnS
sample with different values of
Zn/S (1.5:1, 1:1.5, and 1:1) are measured. The decay curves excited
at 400 nm are shown in Figure 6, and they can be well-fitted using a first-order exponential
decay formula 2  

Figure 6 Lifetime of ZnS with different ratios of Zn/S.

It can be calculated that τ
is 4.68, 4.05, and 3.26 ns, respectively.
The variation of lifetime that could be attributed to the peak at
483 nm is a result of sulfur vacancy transition, and the sample with
Zn/S = 1.5:1 has more sulfur vacancy.

Figure 7 shows that
the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the sample prepared with different
values of Zn/S 1:1, 1.5:1, and 1:1.5 are (0.26, 0.40), (0.33, 0.44),
and (0.40, 0.45), respectively, which shows the change of color from
green to orange. In addition, the luminescence photography is obtained
under the irradiation of a UV lamp. The result revealed that the ratio
of Zn and S has a bigger effect on the emission properties of the
ZnS crystallite.

Figure 7 CIE chromaticity coordinates of ZnS with different ratios
of Zn/S.

As we all know, it is significant
to adjust the ratio of water
and ethanol (W/E) in the reaction process of the hydrothermal reaction.
Therefore, we have prepared a series of samples with different W/E
and their XRD patterns, and the emission spectra excited by 400 nm
are given in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. The XRD patterns revealed
that the obtained materials all belong to the cubic zinc blend structure.
From Figure 9 and its
inset, we could find that the emission intensities of the samples
vary with W/E. When W/E is 1:1, the intensity of emission spectrum
reaches the maximum, and the full width at half-maximum is the narrowest,
which indicates that the optimal reaction condition is half water
and half ethanol, and in this case, the obtained particles have a
good size distribution.

Figure 8 XRD patterns of ZnS with different ratios of
W/E.

Figure 9 Emission spectra of ZnS with different ratios
of W/E.

To investigate the reason of various
spectra, a series of SEM images
of ZnS with different ratios of W/E are obtained and given in Figure 10. Meanwhile, the
calculated diameters of the particles are shown in Figure 10, and (a–e) correspond
to the ratios of 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 and (f) shows the various
curves of crystal size and difference with the W/E. The histograms
of diameter distribution are shown in Supporting Information. From the SEM images, we could find that the ZnS
nanoparticles are spherical, and the diameters vary from 1.39 to 2.25
μm, which match with the change of the peak position in Figure 9 because of the quantum
size effect. The crystallite size and its variance are the minimum
when the W/E ratio is 1:1, which verify what we mentioned in the last
paragraph. As a kind of solvent, ethanol could dissolve oleic acid
in the process of preparation. Therefore, the content of ethanol would
have influence on the solubility of oleic acid, which acts as a surfactant.
Then, the surface state will be changed, and the coating thickness
is optimal when the ratio is 1, which led to better morphology and
performance.

ratios of W/E (a) 3:1, (b) 2:1, (c) 1:1, (d) 1:2, and (e) 1:3 and
(f) relationship between crystallite size and difference and W/E.

A series of Eu3+-ion-doped
ZnS samples with different
concentrations have been synthesized, and their powder XRD patterns
are shown in Figure 11. It could be observed that both Eu3+-doped samples maintain
the same crystal phase with undoped ZnS, which indicates that the
doping of Eu3+ does not change the structure of the ZnS
crystallite. No diffraction peaks associated with any other impurity
material are detected.

Figure 11 XRD of ZnS/Eu3+ with different molar
fractions of Eu3+ ions.

To verify the presence of Eu in the doped samples, the EDS
spectrum
is measured and analyzed. Figure 12 shows the EDS spectrum of 3.5% Eu3+-doped
ZnS crystallite, and it revealed the emission peak corresponding to
Eu along with the characteristic peaks of Zn and S. Table 1 summarizes the estimated atomic
percentages of Zn, S, and Eu in different samples. In addition, the
doped samples show an improved stoichiometry with Zn and S ratio close
to 1:1. It is worthy to note that with the increasing doping concentration,
there is a systematic increase in the atomic percentage of Eu along
with a simultaneous decrease in the Zn content, indicating a possible
replacement of Zn by Eu in the ZnS host lattice. However, there must
be a part of Eu3+ occupying the gap position of ZnS.

0.045, and 0.050)
crystallite is shown in Supporting Information, and it could be found that the absorption region is before 390
nm, which leads to a red shift as a result of the increase of the
Eu3+-doped concentration. The band gaps of ZnS doped with
different molar fractions of Eu3+ are shown in Figure 13, and it indicates
that the band gap became more and more small with the increase of
the doping dosage of Eu3+ ions, and their values are shown
in the inset of Figure 13. Compared with pure ZnS, the calculated band gaps of the
doped crystallite are 3.295, 3.279, 3.257, 3.224, 3.213, and 3.141
eV with the molar fraction of Eu3+ varying from 0.025 to
0.05. Both the shift of absorption and the band gap are the result
of Eu3+ present in the conduction and valence band of the
ZnS crystallite.

different
molar fractions of Eu3+ ions.

The emission spectra of different concentrations of the Eu3+-doped ZnS crystallite are shown in Figure 14 under a single excitation wavelength of
395 nm. It can be seen from the figure that except the peak of ZnS,
there are three peaks which are located at 595, 622, and 701 nm corresponding
to the 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, and 5D0 → 7F4 transition
of Eu3+, respectively. Moreover, when the molar fraction
is 0.035, the intensities of the peak of ZnS/Eu3+ reach
the maximum.

To further investigate the site occupancy information, the
decay
behaviors of the ZnS/Eu3+ sample with different Eu3+ concentrations (0.030, 0.035, and 0.040) are measured. The
decay curves under 395 nm monitoring at 621 nm are shown in Figure 15, and they can
be well-fitted using a second-order exponential decay formula22 3  

Figure 15 Lifetime of ZnS/xEu3+ with different x.

It can be calculated that τ
is 0.450, 0.676, and 1.832 mS
when the molar fraction of Eu3+ is 0.030, 0.035, and 0.040,
respectively. The result reveals that Eu3+ ions mainly
occupy two types of site, and τ changes with the dosage of Eu3+ ions.

Figure 16 shows
the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the ZnS/Eu3+ sample
at (0.27, 0.40), (0.27, 0.39), (0.27, 0.38), (0.26, 0.38), (0.26,
0.39), and (0.39, 0.42) corresponding to the molar fraction from 0.025
to 0.050, respectively. Also, the results indicate that the doping
of Eu3+ into ZnS makes the chromaticity coordinates vary
in the green region.

3 Conclusions
We have
reported a series of pure and Eu3+-doped ZnS
crystallites obtained by a simple hydrothermal route. The XRD pattern
indicates the cubic zinc blend structure of ZnS and ZnS/Eu3+ crystallite was prepared under different conditions. The emission
spectrum shows that the ZnS crystallite could be excited by different
wavelengths, and there are two emission peaks corresponding to the
sulfur and zinc vacancies. In addition, the optimal ratio of W/E is
1:1. The UV–vis absorption spectroscopy and the calculated
band gap show that the band gap became smaller and smaller with the
increase of the doped concentration. The emission spectra of ZnS/Eu3+ included the blue and red emission peak corresponding to
ZnS and Eu3+ ions, and the two emission peaks induce the
samples taking on white. In a word, the emission of the ZnS crystallite
can be modulated by changing the excitation wavelength, by changing
the ratio of water/ethanol or Zn/S, and by adding some Eu3+ ions.

4 Experimental Details
The ZnS and ZnS/Eu3+ crystallites were synthesized by
a hydrothermal method. The starting materials including Zn(CH3COO)2, Na2S, oleic acid, and Eu(CH3COO)3·6H2O are the analytical reagents
without further purification. A certain amount of Na2S
was put into a beaker with deionized water and stirred by a magnetic
stirrer (solution A). Zn(CH3COO)2 and moderate
deionized water were put into another breaker and stirred by a magnetic
stirrer (solution B). When Na2S was totally dissolved,
4 mL of oleic acid was dropped into solution A, and a large number
of flocs were produced. Then, moderate absolute alcohol was added,
and the mixed solution became pale yellow and clear. After that, solution
B was added into the mixed solution slowly, and then a white emulsion
was formed. The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously for 10 min
and transferred into a 100 mL reaction kettle with polytetrafluoroethylene
lining. Then, it was placed in a drying oven and heated at 210 °C
for 14 h. At last, the product was collected by centrifugation and
washed several times with trichloromethane and absolute ethanol. Then,
the final product was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 8 h. The ZnS/Eu3+ crystallite was prepared by adding proportional Eu(CH3COO)3·6H2O into solution B, and
the other operations remain unchanged.

Powder XRD data were
measured on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and
40 mA. The room-temperature photoluminescence spectra were measured
by a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a
150 W Xe lamp as the excitation source. A Hitachi U-4100 ultraviolet
and visible spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV–vis
absorption spectra. The measurement of luminescence lifetime was conducted
by utilizing a Horiba FL-1057 luminescence spectrometer by an excitation
source of 375 nm pulse laser radiation (nano-LED). SEM images were
obtained using an FEI NOVA NANOSEM 450. All of the measurements were
identified at room temperature.
