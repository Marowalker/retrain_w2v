The classic G-quadruplex
motif consists of a continuous array of
3–4 guanine residues with an intermittent loop size of 1–7
nucleotides (G3–4N1–7G3–4N1–7G3–4N1–7G3–4). An RNA G-quadruplex is able to attain only
one parallel G-quadruplex topology owing to steric constraints. Investigating
the possibilities of the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes with a stretch
of sequences deviating from this classic motif will add to the overall
conformations of RNA G-quadruplexes, bestowing diversity to this structure.
Here, we report unusual combinations of guanine residues involved
in RNA G-quadruplex formation in the 5′ untranslated region
(UTR) of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) mRNA using the mutagenesis
approach. Different permutations and combinations of guanine residues
form G-quadruplexes. Upon investigation, G-quadruplexes in 5′
UTR of VWF mRNA are shown to exhibit an inhibitory function.

Introduction
G-quadruplexes are noncanonical secondary
structures found in guanine-rich
regions of DNA and RNA. It consists of G-quartets stacked one above
the other in the presence of monovalent cations. The building unit
of a G-quartet is formed of four guanine residues Hoogteen hydrogen
bonded and arranged in a planar configuration.1 The classic G-quadruplex motif consists of continuous stretches
of 3–4 guanine residues with intermittent loop length of 1–7
nucleotides (G3–4N1–7G3–4N1–7G3–4N1–7G3–4). However, there are reports indicating G-quadruplex
formation by a stretch of sequences deviating from this classic motif.
Phan et al. showed that five G-tract sequences in the c-myc promoter
region can form fold-back G-quadruplexes.2 Chen et al. also reported the formation of unusual intramolecular
G-quadruplexes in the PDGFR-β promoter region.3 Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, they
showed that a guanine region can fold back to fill up the gap in the
broken G-strand. Subsequently, Mukundan and Phan reported intramolecular
DNA G-quadruplexes with three G-quartets, three double-chain reversal
loops, and a bulge.4 They showed that in
spite of the interruption of the first guanine and the next two guanines
by the thymine nucleotide, G-quadruplex formation takes place with
interfering thymine forming the bulge and projecting out of the G-quartet
core.

However, the above-mentioned structures of the G-quadruplex
are
found at the DNA level. There is a requisite to assess varied combinations
of guanine residues in G-quadruplex formation at the RNA level. Studies
on RNA G-quadruplexes have been majorly performed on classic motifs
forming G-quadruplexes with 2–3 G-quartets.5−22 Owing to the presence of 2′ hydroxyl groups in ribose sugars,
the C 2′ endo conformation is possible in RNA, which further
causes anticonformation of the glycosidic bond. Thus, owing to steric
constraints, the RNA G-quadruplex is able to attain only one parallel
G-quadruplex topology.23 As a matter of
fact, exploring the possibilities of varied combinations of guanine
residues in G-quadruplexes at RNA levels will add to the overall conformations
of RNA G-quadruplexes, further adding diversity to this structure.

RNAs are more plastic to accommodate variations in their classic
motif to form G-quadruplexes than dsDNAs. While evaluating the role
of G-quadruplexes in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of several
mRNAs, we hit upon von Willebrand factor (VWF) mRNA having a G-rich
sequence in its 250 nts-long UTR with gene regulatory activity. The
VWF functions as an antihemophilic factor carrier and a platelet-vessel
wall mediator in the blood coagulation system and is crucial in the
homeostasis process. Biophysical characterization of this G-rich sequence
in VWF indicated the ability of this nonclassic motif to form G-quadruplexes.
To determine the guanine residues involved in this unusual G-quadruplex
formation in the 5′ UTR of VWF mRNA, we employed a mutagenesis
approach and a reporter system in cellular conditions. Herein, on
the basis of our results, we reported the existence as well as function
of unusual RNA G-quadruplexes in the 5′ UTR of VWF mRNA.

Results
Dual Luciferase
Assay for Assessing the Role of the G-Rich Sequence
in the 5′ UTR of VWF
To assess the role of the G-rich
sequence in the 5′ UTR of VWF, the entire 5′ UTR of
the VWF gene was cloned at the 5′ end of the Renilla luciferase gene of psiCHECK-2 vector (wtUTR).
As a control, a mutant construct mUTR was generated, where guanine
residues at several positions were mutated to adenines (mUTR). The
presence of the G-rich sequence in the 5′ UTR of the VWF (wtUTR)
repressed the reporter gene expression to 59% (Figure 1). This indicates that the G-rich sequence
in the VWF UTR executes gene inhibitory function.

Figure 1 G-rich sequence in 5′
UTR of VWF mRNA inhibits gene expression.
Dual luciferase assay was performed with HEK 293T cells transfected
with wild-type construct (wtUTR) and mutant construct (mUTR) harboring
point mutations (highlighted in yellow color in the above table where
the sequences represent a snapshot of 250 nts long 5′ UTR of
VWF cloned in psiCHECK-2 vector) in G-rich region of 5′ UTR
of VWF. Experiments were performed in triplicate and the results are
expressed in mean ± SE. Asterisks indicate statistical significance
(Student’s t-test) relative to mUTR-transfected
cells (*, p < 0.05).

Quantification of mRNA Levels in the Presence and Absence of
the G-Rich Sequence Using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
To assess the changes in the transcript level in the presence and
absence of the G-rich sequence, real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) of HEK 293T cells transfected with wtUTR and mUTR constructs
was performed. The transcript levels of reporter genes were similar
in cells transfected with wtUTR and mUTR constructs, indicating that
the UTR G-rich sequence does not alter the mRNA levels of this gene
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 The mRNA levels
of reporter genes remains unchanged in the presence
and absence of G-rich sequence in 5′ UTR of VWF. The transcript
level of reporter genes in cells transfected with wtUTR and mUTR constructs
were quantified using real-time RT-PCR. Experiments were performed
in triplicate, and the results are expressed in mean ± SE.

Biophysical Characterization
of VwtRNA and VmutRNA Sequences
We took a wild-type G-rich
sequence (VwtRNA) of VWF and a mutant
version of the same sequence (VmutRNA), where we mutated guanine residues
at four positions. We performed UV melting of the VwtRNA and VmutRNA
sequences in 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100
mM KCl. UV melting of the VwtRNA sequence shows hypochromicity upon
recording absorbance at 295 nm as a function of temperature (Figure 3A). This hypochromic
UV profile at 295 nm is the characteristic signature of the G-quadruplex.24,25 The wtRNA gave a melting temperature (Tm) value of 74.2 °C. However, VmutRNA oligonucleotides did not
show this UV profile, indicating that they are unable to form the
G-quadruplex. To determine the number of molecules involved in G-quadruplex
formation, we performed UV melting of VwtRNA in different strand concentrations
and calculated the Tm from the melting
profile. UV melting of different strand concentrations gave similar Tm, indicating the formation of intramolecular
G-quadruplexes (Figure 3D).

Figure 3 Biophysical characterization of 2 μM VwtRNA (black) and 2
μM VmutRNA (red) oligonucleotides using (A) UV melting, (B)
CD, (C) TDS, and (D) Tm calculated from
UV melting of VwtRNA at different strand concentrations. Experiments
were performed in 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing
100 mM KCl.

Circular dichroism (CD)
is a technique used for the structural
characterization of a macromolecule. We prepared 2 μM of the
above sequences in 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer containing 100 mM
KCl and took their CD scans. Figure 3B depicts the CD profile of these sequences. The VwtRNA
shows a positive peak at 262 nm and a negative peak at 239 nm, a distinctive
trait of the parallel G-quadruplex. The VmutRNA gave a positive peak
at 266 nm and a negative peak at around 235 and 205 nm, suggesting
its inability to form G-quadruplexes. This VmutRNA sequence is used
as a control for our other experiments. In addition, thermal difference
spectrum (TDS) analysis of VwtRNA and VmutRNA oligonucleotides of
VWF was carried out. The TDS is obtained by subtracting the absorbance
values of the structure in folded and unfolded conditions and plotting
differential absorbance values as a function of wavelength.26 The TDS of VwtRNA oligonucleotides gave maxima
at 245 and 274 nm and a minimum at 296 nm. This corresponds well with
the TDS profile of the G-quadruplex. The VmutRNA sequence gave only
one positive signal at 258 nm, suggesting that it does not form G-quadruplexes
(Figure 3C).

RNase
T1 Footprinting of RNA Oligonucleotides
To determine
the guanine residues involved in the G-quadruplex in the VWF gene,
we performed RNase T1 footprinting of an in vitro transcription (IVT)-generated
VWF oligonucleotide (Figure 4). The RNase T1 enzyme is known to cleave RNAs after guanine
residues in a single-stranded condition. Secondary structure formation
confers bonded guanine residue protection against RNase T1 cleavage.

Figure 4 RNase
T1 footprinting of in vitro transcribed VWF RNA oligonucleotide.
Lanes 1, 2, and 3 represent footprints of VWF RNA oligonucleotide
in the presence of Mg2+, K+, and Li+ ions, respectively, and lane 4 represents RNase T1 ladder. The guanine
residues protected against RNase T1 cleavage in the presence of K+ ions are highlighted in red color (sequence given below).
Numbering of guanine residues is done on the basis of its position
under in vitro-transcribed VWF RNA oligonucleotide.

As potassium ion stabilizes the G-quadruplex better
than lithium
ions and magnesium ions do not contribute to its stability, we performed
footprinting of VWF RNA in the presence of these ions. We compared
the intensity of footprint signals in the presence of K+ versus Mg2+. In the presence of K+ ions, several
guanine residues are protected against RNase T1 cleavage, as reflected
by the less intense bands on gels (Figure 4). Footprinting of VWF RNA shows protection
of guanine residues G15, G17–18, G20–22, G26–28,
G30–32, G34–35, and G38–39 (highlighted in red
color) in the presence of potassium ions. The numbering of these guanine
residues is done on the basis of their position in the 5′ UTR
of VWF. The protection of these large number of guanine residues well
indicates highly polymorphic G-quadruplex formation in this RNA. It
suggests that a mixed population of G-quadruplex structures forms
under in vitro condition.

Dual Luciferase Assay for Determining the
Number of G-Quartets
Involved in G-Quadruplex Formation in the 5′ UTR of Genes
Before determining the complete sequence of the G-quadruplex under
cellular conditions, we assessed whether G3 quadruplex (G-quadruplex
with three G-quartets) formation is taking place in the VWF gene.
Thus, we individually mutated each guanine residue in continuous stretches
of three Gs (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, and M9) by site-directed
mutagenesis and examined the changes in gene expression upon cell
transfection.

Mutations of the consecutive guanine residues
in G-tracts of the G-quadruplex sequence in the VWF 5′ UTR
(M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, and M9) brought back the gene expression
of these mutants similar to that of control mUTR, where G-quadruplex
formation was disrupted (Figure 5). This suggests that these residues are highly important
for G-quadruplex activity and show that G3 quadruplex formation occurs
in the 5′ UTR of VWF.

Figure 5 G-quadruplex in 5′ UTR of VWF mRNA contains
three G-quartets.

and constructs with point mutations in G-tracts (highlighted in yellow
color in the table above where the sequences represent a snapshot
of 250 nts long 5′ UTR of VWF cloned in psiCHECK-2 vector).
Experiments were performed in triplicate and the results are expressed
in mean ± SE. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (Student’s t-test) relative to VWF mUTR-transfected cells (*, p < 0.05).

Dual Luciferase Assay for Determining Complete G-Quadruplex
Sequences in the 5′ UTR of VWF
Once we have shown
that the G-quadruplex in the 5′ UTR of VWF is composed of three
G-quartets, we pursued our search for the complete G-quadruplex forming
sequence in the 5′ UTR of VWF. As we have already traced three
G-tracts (comprising three guanine residues), there is a requirement
for a fourth G-stem to form G-quadruplexes. Because these G-tracts
have G-rich neighbors at both their sides, we initially assessed the
role of guanine residues toward the 5′ region. We mutated the
guanine residues G17 and G18 in M10 construct and G15 in M11 plasmid,
transfected them into cells, and performed dual luciferase assay.
We observed that mutations in the M10 and M11 plasmids reduced the
gene expression to 32 and 22%, respectively (Figure 6). Surprisingly, this inhibition in reporter
protein production by these plasmids was higher compared to wtUTR,
where the presence of G-quadruplexes suppressed the reporter protein
production to 59%. This suggested that instead of abrogating G-quadruplex-mediated
gene suppression, these mutations have aggravated its suppressive
effects. This further indicates that these guanine residues are not
participating in the G-quadruplex function under normal conditions.
As a matter of fact, it suggested that guanine residues toward the
3′ region of three G-tracts are involved in the G-quadruplex
formation.

Figure 6 Guanine located toward 5′ side of the three G-tracts are
not involved in native G-quadruplex formation in 5′ UTR of
VWF mRNA. Dual luciferase assay results of HEK 293T cells transfected
with wtUTR and constructs with point mutations in G-tracts (highlighted
in yellow color in the table above). Experiments were performed in
triplicate and results are expressed in mean ± SE. Asterisks
indicate statistical significance (Student’s t-test) relative to VWF mUTR-transfected cells (*, p < 0.05).

Thus, to pinpoint the
guanine residues involved in the G-quadruplex
stem formation, we individually mutated several guanine residues present
in the 3′ region of the constructs—M12, M13, M14, M15,
M16, M17, and M18. Again, mutations in M15 and M16 caused further
reduction in gene expression (31 and 44%, respectively), whereas the Renilla luciferase gene expression in M12 and M13
was similar to that of the wtUTR (Figure 7). Interestingly, the mutations in M17 and
M18 increased the gene expression (71 and 82% respectively) as compared
to wild-type constructs (59%) and the mutations in M14 brought back
the gene expression similar to control plasmid mUTR, where the G-quadruplex
formation was completely disrupted. There was no significant difference
in the reporter gene expression between M14 and mUTR. These results
suggested that guanine residues mutated in M14 (G38) and M18 (G45)
constructs are highly important in G-quadruplex formation.

located toward 3′ side of the three G-tracts
are involved in native G-quadruplex formation in 5′ UTR of
VWF mRNA. Dual luciferase assay results of the HEK 293T cells transfected
with wtUTR and constructs with point mutations in G-tracts (highlighted
in yellow color in the table above). Experiments were performed in
triplicate and the results are expressed in mean ± SE. Asterisks
indicate statistical significance (Student’s t-test) relative to VWF mUTR-transfected cells (*, p < 0.05).

Furthermore, to identify
a third guanine residue engaged in the
G-quadruplex stem formation, we generated mutants M19, M20, M21, M22,
and M23, where we mutated several guanine residues to permit the possibility
of only one G-quadruplex formation. We found that the Renilla luciferase expression in M19, M20, M21, M22,
and M23 are 46, 35, 37, 81, and 51%, respectively (Figure 8).

residues involved in the native G-quadruplex
formation in 5′ UTR of VWF mRNA. HEK 293T cells were transfected
with VWF wtUTR and constructs with point mutations in the G-tract
of 5′ UTR of VWF (highlighted in yellow color in the table
above), and dual luciferase assay was performed. Experiments were
performed in triplicate and the results are expressed in mean ±
SE. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (Student’s t-test) relative to VWF mUTR-transfected cells (*, p < 0.05).

Next, we performed UV melting experiments using four mutated
oligonucleotides
that correspond to M12, M15, M16, and M22 (sequences from 20th base
to 45th base as shown in the Figures 7 and 8) along with the wild-type
sequence. We observed that the oligonucleotides corresponding to M12,
M15, and M16 show typical hypochromicity upon recording absorbance
at 295 nm as a function of temperature (Figure 9), confirming the formation of G-quadruplexes.
The oligonucleotide that corresponds to M22 does not show typical
hypochromicity, indicating its inability to form G-quadruplexes.

20 to 45 shown in WT, M12, M15, M16, and M22. Experiments were performed

2 μM oligonucleotides.

Discussion
In comparison with the DNA G-quadruplex,
the RNA G-quadruplex is
a newer field of research. Information on RNA G-quadruplex formation
is limited to classic G-quadruplex motifs, where the guanine residues
in G-stretches vary from 2 to 4 nucleotides. Owing to the presence
of steric hindrance induced by the 2′ hydroxyl group of ribose
sugars, only parallel topology is possible limiting the conformational
diversity of the RNA G-quadruplex.23 Recently,
stacked dimeric G-quadruplexes with bulges have been reported in the
5′ terminal region of human telomerase RNA (hTERC).27 Another report by Perreault and group showed
that an RNA G-quadruplex can form with a long central loop of 30 nucleotides
and can modulate translation.28 Also, RNA
mimics containing G-quadruplex structures of unusual topology were
shown to induce fluorescence in chromophore.29,30

Although studies on unusual DNA G-quadruplex formation validated
their occurrence in in vitro conditions by primarily employing an
NMR technique approach,3,4 their existence in in cellulo
condition still requires authentication. Thus, we added dimensions
to our study by examining the existence of unusual RNA G-quadruplexes
in cellular conditions and assessing its function in the UTR of an
mRNA. We employed site-directed mutagenesis and reporter assay approach
to test the guanine residues involved in the RNA structure formation
in the 5′ UTR of VWF mRNA.

We explored the role of the
G-rich sequence in the 5′ UTR
of VWF mRNA by cloning the entire 5′ UTR of VWF gene in reporter
vector (wtUTR) and generating mUTR mutant that mutated guanine residues
at several positions. On performing the dual luciferase assay, we
obtained a significant decrease in the Renilla luciferase gene expression in wtUTR constructs, indicating that
the G-rich sequence in the 5′ UTR of VWF mRNA exhibits gene-inhibiting
function. Furthermore, the transcript profile of reporter genes in
cells transfected with wtUTR and mUTR was similar, indicating that
the G-rich sequence does not regulate transcription and mRNA stability.

Furthermore, to test the ability of the G-rich sequence (VwtRNA)
in the VWF UTR to form G-quadruplexes, we performed its biophysical
characterization using UV and CD spectroscopy in 10 mM sodium cacodylate
buffer containing 100 mM KCl. CD spectra of the VwtRNA sequence displayed
the parallel G-quadruplex signature, well in agreement with the previous
reports on RNA G-quadruplexes.5−18 Also, on performing UV melting at 295 nm wavelength, the VwtRNA
sequence displayed a hypochromic shift with increasing temperature,
a trait distinctive to the G-quadruplex. On the other hand, mutRNA
mutant sequences harboring mutations in guanine residues did not display
CD, TDS, and UV signature of the G-quadruplex, indicating its inability
to form G-quadruplexes.

Close inspection of the CD profile (Figure 3B) revealed small
amplitude of signals around
290 nm. A UV TDS (Figure 3C) also showed a negative peak at around 290 nm. Additionally,
we observed mild hypochromicity below 60 °C in UV melting studies
(Figure 3A). All of
these observations hint toward the formation of antiparallel structures
from a small fraction of the oligonucleotide. So far, all known naturally
occurring RNA G-quadruplexes are parallel stranded.23 However, recently an unusual G-quadruplex motif is found
in a 97 nt RNA fluorogenic aptamer known as Spinach. Spinach, an in
vitro-selected RNA aptamer that binds a GFP-like ligand and adopts
an elongated fold containing two sets of coaxially stacked helical
stems that flank the ligand-binding region (L).29,30 This L region folds into a new RNA quadruplex motif that contains
only two layers of G-tetrads. There are two strands in this L region,
and each strand contributes four Gs to the quadruplex, forming two
parallel segments via double-chain reversal loops. Within the 5′
side of the ligand binding region, there are two pairs of consecutive
residues with antiglycosidic conformations, each of which forms a
corner of the quadruplex connected through the double-chain reversal
loop. Within the 3′ side of the ligand binding region, pairs
of noncontiguous guanosine residues form the other two corners of
the quadruplex, connected through the double-chain reversal loop and
looped-out residues. Within this configuration, three guanosine residues
adopt the syn-glycosidic conformation, and one adopts
the anticonformation, giving rise to an unusual G-quadruplex topology.
We may have a similar kind of situation in the present case; however,
high-resolution structural study is required for any confirmative
understanding.

Once we confirmed the ability of wtRNA sequences
to form G-quadruplexes
in vitro, we assessed the participation of three G-quartets in G-quadruplex
formation (G3 quadruplex) in the UTR by incorporating mutations in
G-tracts of G-quadruplexes of the VWF UTR. Point mutations in G-quartets
completely disturbed the activity of G-quadruplexes and showed gene
expression similar to mUTR, where G-quadruplex activity was completely
disrupted. In other words, we demonstrated that G3 quadruplexes prevail
in the VWF UTR, where G-quadruplexes are composed of three G-quartets.

We continued our search for complete G-quadruplex sequences in
the VWF UTR by assessing the involvement of guanine residues at the
neighborhood of these G-tracts. From results based on point mutations
and luciferase reporter assay, we found that the mutations of guanine
residues at the 5′ side of G-tracts did not abrogate the function
of the G-quadruplex, indirectly suggesting that guanine residues present
at the 3′ side of G-tracts are highly important in the G-quadruplex
formation. As three guanine residues of the fourth strand of the G-quadruplex
are required to form from seven guanine residues, 35 combinations
of guanine residues are possible. By employing the procedure of site-directed
mutagenesis and reporter assay, we ascertained the essentiality of
two residues: G38 (mutated in M14) and G45 (mutated in M18) in G-quadruplex
formation. G38 mutation in M14 restored the gene expression similar
to that of the mutant mUTR and G45 mutation in M18 partially rescued
the reporter gene expression from the suppressive effects of G-quadruplexes.
There is also a possibility of the involvement of M17 (G42) in the
G-quadruplex formation, as its mutation slightly increased the gene
expression.

Although G34/G35/G39/G41 mutations (M12, M13, M15,
M16) did not
abrogate the G-quadruplex formation, we hypothesized that one of these
residues is involved in the G-quadruplex formation because they lie
close to two residues G38 and G45, which are highly important for
the G-quadruplex formation. Because the 5′ UTR of VWF is G-rich
and the vicinity of three G-tracts contains several guanine residues,
the chances of polymorphic G-quadruplex formation are quite high in
this region. Different combinations of guanine residues may give rise
to the G-quadruplex structure. This polymorphism is well-supported
by RNase T1 footprinting results of VWF RNA oligonucleotides, where
a large number of guanine residues was protected against cleavage,
indicating that mixed population of G-quadruplexes exists under in
vitro condition. For this reason, our in cellulo study testing the
complete G-quadruplex forming sequence in the VWF 5′ UTR was
highly intriguing. Whenever we mutated a guanine residue (a potent
candidate) to adenine in a few instances, it changed the gene expression
of the reporter genes in other directions. Instead of restoring the
reporter gene expression back to the mutant mUTR, it further repressed
the gene expression. Point mutations in this G-rich region probably
permit the other guanine residues to take up the charge of the G-quadruplex
formation, demonstrating a shift in the equilibrium upon mutating
guanine residues. The resulting G-quadruplex function deviates from
the wild-type G-quadruplex role and may modify the extent of gene
regulation accordingly. As a matter of fact, as point mutations change
the gene expression of the reporter gene extensively, we speculate
that a specific combination of G-tracts within this segment may aid
the formation of a conformational switch, thereby fine-tuning the
VWF gene expression. The fine-tuning of the VWF gene expression is
of prime importance because it is involved in blood clot formation
and homeostasis maintenance. The existence of such a flexible conformational
switch has previously been reported in RNA G-quadruplexes located
in VEGF IRES.16

Owing to the shift
in equilibrium in overall G-quadruplex configuration,
it was very difficult to pin-point a third guanine residue involved
in G-quadruplex formation under normal cellular conditions. However,
as we have identified the involvement of G38 and G45 residues in the
G-quadruplex, it has narrowed down our search for the third residue
from five possible combinations. To further identify the third guanine
residue among G34, G35, G39, G41, and G42 forming the G-quadruplex
stem, we undertook a reverse approach where we negated the possibility
of polymorphic G-quadruplex formation and permitted the chance of
only one G-quadruplex formation involving G38, G45, and G34/G35/G39/G41/G42
(M19, M20, M21, M22, M23). However, dual luciferase assay of all of
these mutants showed G-quadruplex existence and inhibitory function,
indicating the possibility of G34/G35/G39/G41/G42 involved in the
stem formation. Among these mutants, M23 mutant showed gene expressions
similar to that of wild-type wtUTR, suggesting that the G-quadruplex
formed in M23 may be mimicking the activity of G-quadruplexes present
in the VWF wtUTR.

In UV melting studies, we observed that oligonucleotide
corresponding
to M22 did not show any typical hypochromicity upon recording absorbance
at 295 nm as a function of temperature, indicating its inability to
form G-quadruplexes, which in fact was also reflected its inability
to suppress the protein expression in luciferase studies. Mutations
in M22 increased the gene expression to 81%. Oligonucleotides corresponding
to M12, M15, and M16 showed typical hypochromicity, confirming the
formation of G-quadruplexes and corroborating qualitatively with observations
obtained in luciferase studies. However, M12 that affects the luciferase
expression similarly as wtUTR gives a very different melting profile
from wtUTR. Oligonucleotides deviating from a typical G3–4N1–7G3–4N1–7G3–4N1–7G3–4 sequence need some kind of an inducer to form a quadruplex in vivo.
We have seen that the in vitro-selected RNA aptamer29 does not have typical G-stretches in its sequence and does
not give typical quadruplex signature in UV melting, CD, and footprinting
at low concentrations. However, at very high concentrations (mM range)
and in the presence of the GFP-like ligand, this aptamer showed quadruplex
signature in vitro. Similarly, here we speculate that some cellular
components, such as proteins, can act as inducers to form highly stable
RNA quadruplexes. Actually, it is highly difficult to correlate in
vivo and in vitro results in the absence of inducers. More similar
type of studies is required to have a fair knowledge on inducers and
their role in RNA quadruplex formation.

The best strategy to
test the unusual RNA G-quadruplex occurrence
is to extrapolate the findings of DNA G-quadruplexes at the RNA level.
“Alternate G-quadruplex with bulge” is the structure
known to exist in DNA, where the G-stretch interfering nucleotide
forms the bulge projecting out of the G-quadruplex core.4 The RNA G-quadruplex was revealed to form from
the sequence GGGUUGCGGAGGGUGGGC, where cytosine-interrupting contiguous
guanine residues form a bulge employing NMR studies.27 On the basis of these reported alternate G-quadruplex structures
and our results, we built five models of alternate RNA G-quadruplexes
present in the 5′ UTR of VWF in normal cellular conditions.
All of these models show that the residues G20–22, G26–G28,
G30–G32, G38, and G45 are involved in the stem formation and
residues A23–A25, A29, and U33 are involved in the loop formation.
Out of these, four models have two bulges and one model has only one
bulge. In the first model, G34 is involved in the stem formation;
U33 is involved in the loop formation; the residues G35, U36, and
U37 form the first bulge; and G39, U40, G41, G42, A43, and U44 form
the second bulge (Figure 10A). In the second model, G35 forms the stem; U33 and G34 form
the loop; U36 and U37 form the first bulge; and G39, U40, G41, G42,
A43, and U44 form the second bulge (Figure 10B). In the third model, G39 is involved
in the stem formation; U33, G34, G35, U36, and U37 form the loop;
and the residues U40, G41, G42, A43, and U44 form the bulge (Figure 10C). In the fourth
model, G41 constitutes stem; U33, G34, G35, U36, and U37 are involved
in the loop formation; G39 and U40 form the first bulge; and G42,
A43, and U44 form the second bulge (Figure 10D). In the fifth model, G42 constitutes
the stem; U33, G34, G35, U36, U37 form the loop; the residues G39,
U40, G41 constitute the first bulge; and A43 and U44 constitute the
second bulge (Figure 10E).

mRNA. The numbering of guanine residues represents their position
in 5′ UTR of VWF mRNA.

To unravel the overall structure of such G-quadruplexes under
in
vitro condition, NMR of VWF RNA is highly required. As the existence
of the unusual structure in DNA G-quadruplexes was demonstrated using
the NMR approach, the same would highlight the residues involved in
RNA G-quadruplex formation; however, it would be difficult to experimentally
establish this complicated fold, particularly for RNA (personal communication
with Prof. Anh Tuan Phan). Moreover, in vitro studies would not be
able to build an overall picture of an unusual RNA G-quadruplex at
the cellular level as indicated by RNase T1 footprinting analysis.

To summarize, our study pioneers in establishing the existence
as well as the importance of the unusual RNA G-quadruplex structure
in the UTR of mRNA. The existence of RNA G-quadruplex structures with
varied combinations of guanine residues requires extensive research,
and much progress on its functional aspects is called for. Testing
the alternative ways to form G-quadruplexes will diversify the entire
arena of RNA G-quadruplex complexity, predictability, and functionality.

Materials
and Methods

The HPLC-purified RNA oligonucleotides
(Table 1) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. The concentration of oligonucleotides was calculated
from their absorbance readings obtained from the UV spectrophotometer
and their molar extinction coefficient values.

The DNA oligonucleotides employed
for the cloning purpose were
also procured from Sigma-Aldrich.

Cloning
The dual
luciferase vector psiCHECK-2 was used
for the cloning purpose. The 5′ UTR sequence of the genes studied
were inserted at the Nhe I restriction site located at the 5′
end of the Renilla luciferase gene
(Scheme 1). Briefly,
the primers against 250 bp VWF 5′ UTR were designed according
to the GenBank Sequence NM_000552.3. The entire 5′ UTR of
VWF were PCR-amplified from MCF-7 cDNA employing the Phusion DNA polymerase
Hot Start II enzyme (Thermo Scientific) and thereby gel eluted using
a gel extraction kit (Qiagen).

UTR of VWF Cloned at the Nhe
I Site of Renilla Luciferase Gene of
psiCHECK-2 Vector
The position of forward primer
(FP) and reverse primer (RP) used for cloning is also shown. The G-rich
sequence in 5′ UTR of VWF is highlighted in bold.

Both the vector and the amplicon (VWF 5′ UTR) were
digested
by Nhe I restriction enzymes (NEB) and again purified using the PCR
purification kit (Qiagen). The Nhe I-digested vector was dephosphorylated
using Calf intestinal dephosphatase (NEB) to prevent self-ligation.
The dephosphorylated vector and the amplicon were ligated at 22 °C
for 16 h using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas). The clones were digested
with the Nhe I restriction enzyme, gel-run, and checked for insert
release. The positive clones were subsequently confirmed by sequencing.

Site-directed mutagenesis at specific positions in the 5′
UTR of VWF (mUTR, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11, M12,
M13, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18, M19, M20, M21, M22, and M23) were carried
out using a Kappa Ready Mix (Saflabs). Briefly, wild-type constructs
(wtUTR) were PCR-amplified with primers containing mutations at the
annealing temperature of 58 °C. Then, the wild-type vector backbone
was digested with Dpn 1 at 37 °C for 6 h. DH5α Escherichia coli cells were then transformed by these
PCR products. The positive clones obtained were confirmed by sequencing.

Cell Culture
The HEK 293T cell line was maintained
at the humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 incubator
at 37 °C. The cells were grown in high-glucose DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic–antimycotic (Gibco).

Dual Luciferase Assay
The HEK 293T cells in a 24-well
plate were transfected with the aforementioned plasmids using the
lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The dual luciferase assay
was performed after 48 h of incubation. Briefly, the transfected cells
were lysed with passive lysis buffer. Then, the Renilla and firefly luciferase readings of cell lysates were obtained using
a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Tecan plate reader. The
ratio of the Renilla luciferase activity
to the firefly luciferase activity was subsequently calculated and
normalized against the corresponding mutant plasmid readings (mUTR).

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
The HEK 293T cell lines
were transfected with the plasmids (wtUTR and mUTR) in a 48-well plate
using the lipofectamine 2000 reagent. After 24 h of incubation, the Renilla and firefly luciferase mRNA levels were quantified
using real-time PCR. Briefly, the total RNA of the transfected cells
was isolated using the Trizol reagent. Then, cDNA was prepared using
the MMuLV reverse transcriptase enzyme and oligo dT primers (Fermentas).
Subsequently, forward and reverse primers of the firefly and Renilla luciferase genes were used to quantify mRNA
levels of reporter genes using a SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) and the Roche Detection system. The transcript level of Renilla luciferase gene was normalized using the
Pffafl method and depicted in histogram.

UV Spectroscopy
The RNA samples (2 μM) were prepared
in 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM KCl.
The samples were first preheated at 95 °C for 5 min and then
slowly cooled to 4 °C. The UV melting experiments were performed
using a Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Varian) equipped
with a Peltier temperature controller. The samples were heated at
95 °C and then allowed to cool to 20 °C at 0.2 °C/min.
The absorbance values were recorded at the wavelength of 295 nm and
at 0.2 °C data intervals of heating and cooling steps. The UV
melting of VwtRNA was also performed at different strand concentrations
in 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM KCl.

Circular Dichroism
The RNA samples (2 μM) were
prepared in 10 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100
mM KCl. The CD experiments were conducted in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter
(Jasco Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Peltier temperature
controller, and scans were taken at 200–350 nm wavelength at
20 °C. Postsubtraction of buffer alone, the CD scans were taken
in triplicate and the resultant average scan was collected.

Thermal
Difference Spectrum
TDS is calculated by recording
the absorbance of RNA samples at the wavelength of 200–350
nm at temperatures 20 and 95 °C. The TDS curve is then obtained
by subtracting their absorbance values and plotting it against the
wavelength. The RNA samples were prepared in 10 mM sodium cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM KCl.

In Vitro Transcription
The dsDNA template for IVT was
prepared by annealing the primer set at 37 °C for 1 h.

The RNA was transcribed from the DNA template harboring T7 promoter
using a MEGAscript Kit (Ambion). Briefly, the DNA template was incubated
with NTPs, T7 DNA polymerase, and enzyme mix buffer for a duration
of 16 h at 37 °C. The template DNA was then degraded using the
TURBO DNase enzyme (Ambion). The RNA products were subsequently purified
using NucAway columns (Ambion).

Footprinting
RNA
oligonucleotides were radiolabeled
using a KinaseMax kit (Ambion). Briefly, RNA was incubated with T4
polynucleotide kinase and (γ-32P) ATP for 1 h at
37 °C. The reaction was stopped using 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) and by heating at 95 °C for 2 min. The labeled RNA
was further purified using NucAway columns (Ambion).

5′
end radiolabeled RNAs were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and subsequently
cooled to 37 °C in 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, and 150
mM LiCl to assist the structure formation. The structured RNA was
then digested with 0.025 units of RNase T1 for 15 min at 37 °C.
In addition, an RNase T1 ladder was generated by digesting RNA in
buffer containing 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2,
and 100 mM LiCl for 2 min at 37 °C with 0.6 U of RNase T1. All
reactions were stopped by the addition of stop buffer containing 95%
formamide and 18 mM EDTA and subsequent immediate snap chilling on
dry ice. Equal counts of digested products were separated onto a 15%
denaturing gel in 0.5× tris borate EDTA buffer and exposed to
a phosphorimager screen. The gel images were scanned on a Typhoon
scanner (GE Healthcare).
