A series
of compounds with cobalt doping in the indium site of
Ba2In2O5 brownmillerites exhibited
excellent oxygen reduction activity under alkaline conditions. Doping
(25%) retains the brownmillerite structure with disorder in the O3
site in the two-dimensional alternate layer along the ab plane. Further substitution of cobalt in the indium site leads to
the loss of a brownmillerite structure, and the compound attains a
perovskite structure. Cobalt-doped samples exhibited far better oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) activity when compared to the parent Ba2In2O5 brownmillerite. Among the series
of compounds, BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ with the highest Co doping and oxygen vacancies randomly distributed
in the lattice exhibited the best ORR activity. BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ showed a 40 mV positive
shift in the onset potential with better limiting current density
and a nearly four-electron-transfer reduction pathway when compared
to the parent Ba2In2O5 brownmillerite.

Introduction
Owing to the increased
energy demand and high levels of pollution
from the conventional fuels, an alternative energy source with minimal
environmental impact is the need of the hour. Fuel cell technology
is considered as one of the promising options with environmentally
benign byproducts.1−3 An oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode
of low-temperature fuel cells has gained considerable interest in
the past few decades because of its importance in the efficiency of
the fuel cell.4 The ORR is, in general,
a sluggish electrochemical reaction and requires precious metals as
electrocatalysts to enhance activity and durability.5−7 The state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for the ORR in fuel cells is
based on platinum (Pt). However, a widespread use of Pt is limited
because of its high cost and scarcity.8−10 The ORR under alkaline
conditions is more facile than under acidic conditions; moreover,
a wide range of non-noble metal-based materials have been shown as
potential candidates toward electrocatalysis under such conditions.11,12 Metal oxides involving perovskites, brownmillerites, spinels, pyrochlores,
and so forth; heteroatom-doped carbon nanomorphologies; nitrogen-coordinated
metals on carbon matrixes; and so forth are studied as ORR catalysts.13−20 Because of the low cost, high stability under strong alkaline conditions,
high corrosion resistance, and facile synthesis procedure, perovskite-type
oxides are investigated extensively in the past few years as electrocatalysts
for the ORR.21 Transition-metal atoms in
these oxides are believed to be the active center for the ORR. Perovskite-type
oxides are also reported to exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward
the ORR under cathodic polarization because of the formation of oxygen
vacancy.

Brownmillerites, A2B2O5, a class
of compounds structurally similar to perovskites and having an inherent
oxygen vacancy in their structure can be envisaged as potential electrocatalysts
for the ORR. These compounds have oxygen vacancies ordered in the
two-dimensional layer in the lattice.22 Doping “B” site with transition metals exhibiting
redox properties can be envisaged to improve the ORR activity of the
compounds. Moreover, doping will also lead to the random distribution
of oxygen vacancy along the lattice, which will again add to the efficiency
of the catalyst. In the present study, cobalt doping in the indium
site of Ba2In2O5 brownmillerite and
its effect on the structure as well as ORR activity under alkaline
medium is investigated. The parent Ba2In2O5 is a thoroughly studied mixed ionic and electronic-conducting
material showing excellent ionic conductivity at higher temperature
where the orthorhombic structure of brownmillerite transforms to cubic
with the oxygen vacancies disordered in the lattice.23 Cobalt (Co) is chosen as a dopant in this study mainly
because of its ability not only to enhance conductivity and redox
property but also to induce oxygen vacancy disorder in the brownmillerite
lattice.24,25 Also, the incorporation of such a redox
center in the lattice will make the catalyst tolerant to local changes
in the oxygen concentration owing to the structural stability of brownmillerite
and may result in an effective ORR active electrocatalyst. It was
in fact observed that Co doping in Ba2In2O5 improved the ORR activity of the samples.

Results and Discussion
Ba2In2–xCoxO5−δ series of compounds
was synthesized by a solid-state reaction, and the phase purity of
the compounds was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Figure 1a represents the
PXRD patterns of all the synthesized compounds.

Figure 1 (a) PXRD pattern of Ba2In2–xCoxO5−δ (x = 0.5, 1,
and 1.5) and (b) enlarged portion
of PXRD patterns of Co-doped Ba2In2O5 brownmillerite. The shoulder peaks are due to Kα2 radiations.

The PXRD pattern of Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ reveals that the compound crystallizes
in a tetragonal system, whereas further doping in the “B”
site of Ba2In2O5 with cobalt leads
to the formation of a cubic perovskite structure. Further, a closer
observation into the PXRD patterns of the Co-doped Ba2In2O5 system reveals that with increase in the Co
concentration, there is a gradual shift in the peaks toward higher
2θ as shown in Figure 1b, which indicates a decrease in the lattice parameters with
higher Co doping. This can be attributed to the lower crystal radii
of cobalt than that of indium.

The detailed structural parameters
of the synthesized materials
were determined by Rietveld refinement of the PXRD patterns using
GSAS–EXPGUI software. The structural parameters obtained after
refinement of cobalt-doped Ba2In2O5 compounds are tabulated in Table 1. The Rietveld refinement plot of the compounds is
shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Rietveld refinement of the PXRD pattern of Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ was carried
out using the structural parameters of hydrated Ba2In2O5 in P4/mmm space
group (JCPDS file no. 01-089-9079).26 The
In/Co ratio in the “B” site was manually assigned as
75 and 25% of the occupancy, respectively, and the refinement with
these parameters proceeded smoothly.

However, refinement of the patterns of systems with
higher concentrations
of Co with the same model was not fruitful. Hence, a model of cubic
perovskite, BaZrO3 (JCPDS file no. 01-074-1299), was selected
because the PXRD pattern of this model matches with that of Ba2In2–xCoxO5−δ (x = 1 and 1.5)
with a small shift in 2θ values.27 Rietveld refinement with these parameters proceeded smoothly, and
both BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ and BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ fitted to the cubic Pm3̅m space group.

The polyhedral representations of the compounds
are shown in Figure 2. In Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ, the
brownmillerite structure of hydrated Ba2In2O5 is retained. There is a disorder in the O3 site in the two-dimensional
alternate layer along the ab plane evident from the
two equivalent positions of the O3 site. Further substitution of cobalt
in the indium site of Ba2In2O5, viz.,
BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ and
BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ,
leads to the loss of the brownmillerite structure, and the compound
attains a perovskite structure with the B-site cation (In/Co) surrounded
by six oxygen atoms in an octahedral geometry as shown in Figure 2b,c. The oxygen vacancies
in these compounds are randomly distributed throughout the lattice.

refinement parameters for (a) Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ, (b) BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ, and (c) BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ.

The lattice parameters of Co-doped Ba2In2O5 with variation in the Co concentration are depicted
in Figure 3. For comparison
with other cubic systems, the pseudocubic lattice parameter of tetragonal
Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ was calculated (see the Supporting Information for details). It is evident from the plot that cell lengths and
cell volumes decrease with increase in Co concentration. This can
be attributed to the smaller crystal radius of Co (0.72 and 0.68 Å
for tetrahedral and octahedral coordination, respectively) when compared
to that of In (0.76 and 0.94 Å for tetrahedral and octahedral
coordination, respectively).28

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were
carried
out to study the oxidation state of metals. Figure 4 shows the XPS spectra obtained over the
range of 772.5–800 eV. In this region, the Co 2p3/2 and Ba 3d5/2 peaks overlap around 780 eV and Co 2p1/2 and Ba 3d3/2 peaks overlap around 796 eV; however,
individual peaks could be extracted through deconvolution.29 The Ba2+ peak lies at slightly higher
binding energy when compared to Co ions. The spin–orbit splitting
of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 in all the compounds
was found to be around 15.3 eV, indicating Co in the +3 oxidation
state. Also, the absence of satellite features around 786 eV discards
the chances of Co2+ on the surface.30

in black circles, fitted spectra in red, deconvoluted peaks of Co
and Ba in brown and pink, respectively, and the baseline in blue.

Further, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface
area of all the samples was measured using N2 adsorption
study. It was observed that the surface area of the sample was in
between 0.1 and 0.6 m2 g–1 as expected
from the high-temperature solid-state synthesis method employed for
the preparation of the samples. The BET surface area of the samples
is tabulated in Table S1 (Supporting Information). It can be observed that the surface area gradually increases with
increase in the Co concentration, where various factors such as transition
in the structure from tetragonal to cubic as well as intermediate
grinding during the synthesis can attribute to this.

To get
an insight into the conductivity of the samples, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements using the pellets made from
these oxide materials were performed at 300 °C under ambient
atmosphere. The analysis of the ac impedance scans obtained from such
materials can be done on the basis of the Bauerle model31 as mentioned by Jankovic et al. in similar compounds.32 Table S2 (in the Supporting Information) shows the total resistance of the Co-doped Ba2In2O5 samples. It can be observed that
the resistance decreases with increase in the Co concentration, indicating
better conductivity of the samples with a higher concentration of
Co. The enhancement in the conductivity is due to the enhanced amount
of Co in the lattice, which also leads to the transition of the structure
from tetragonal to cubic, which in fact facilitates the conductivity
through the lattice. The improved conductivity in the samples will
favor the transfer of charges from the catalyst to oxygen during the
ORR.33

The detailed electrochemical
studies on the series of compounds
for the ORR activity were carried out in alkaline medium using cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) methods. All the
samples were mixed with Vulcan XC-72 carbon to improve the electrical
conductivity of the compounds. The contribution from carbon toward
ORRs in the catalyst composite is negligible, as evident from our
previous studies in the brownmillerite–carbon composite.15 At first, the cyclic voltammogram of all the
samples was recorded in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a sweep
rate of 20 mV s–1 and then under O2 saturation
at the same sweep rate. Figure 5a represents the voltammograms of all the samples under both
N2- and O2-saturated solutions. No characteristic
peaks are observed under N2-saturated solution, whereas
a clear reduction peak can be seen in all the samples under O2-saturated solution. An increase in the reduction current
after purging O2 in the solution indicates the ORR activity
of the samples.

(d) dependence of the electron-transfer number of Co-doped Ba2In2O5 on varying potentials; the experiments
were done in 0.1 M KOH solution using Hg/HgO and Pt wire as the reference
and counter electrodes, respectively.

A detailed investigation on the ORR activity of the samples
was
performed by the RDE method. Figure 5b represents the LSVs of Co-doped Ba2In2O5. It is evident from the figure that there is
an improvement in the ORR activity with increase in the Co concentration.
The onset potential of Co-doped samples is more positive than that
of the parent Ba2In2O5, which was
observed to be around −0.12 V versus Hg/HgO.16 Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ exhibited an onset potential of −0.11 V which is 10 mV more
positive than that of the parent Ba2In2O5. However, BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ and BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ exhibited onset potentials of −0.09 and −0.08 V, respectively,
which are 30 and 40 mV higher than that of the parent Ba2In2O5. Also, it is evident from the figure
that with increase in the Co concentration, the limiting current density
increases, which can be attributed to the ability of cobalt to enhance
the conductivity of the catalyst. The improved ORR activity of BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ and BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ when compared
to that of the parent brownmillerite and with increase in the cobalt
concentration can be attributed to the presence of catalytically active
Co atoms in the “B” site. It is well-known that the
transition metals in such oxides are responsible for ORR activity.
Interestingly, Co doping in Ba2In2O5 gives a better voltammogram with a distinct mass transport region;
these types of behaviors are not visible in many other brownmillerites
and other oxide systems.16,34−36 This observation can be correlated to the studies carried out by
Suntivich et al. where the authors have observed that an eg filling of 1 in the Co3+ ion in LaCoO3 enhances the ORR activity. Similar configuration can also
be expected in our case because Co is mainly in the Co3+ state. Too little eg filling leads to
strong B–O2 bonding, whereas too high eg filling leads to very weak B–O2 bonding;
both the situations are not desirable for good ORR activity. However,
moderate eg filling will lead to an ideal
state where the bond strength between the B-site cation and O2 will be neither too strong nor too weak, leading to maximum
activity as evident from Sabatier’s principle.13

LSVs of all the samples at different electrode rotation
rates in
O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution are represented in Figure
S2 (Supporting Information). It is clear
from the figure that the limiting current density increases with increase
in the rotation rate of the electrode; this can be attributed to the
enhanced rate of mass transport at a higher electrode rotation rate.37 Additional information such as number of electrons
(n) involved in the ORR was determined by the Koutecky–Levich
(K–L) equation38  where “j” is
the disk electrode current density, “k”
is the reaction rate constant, “n”
is the number of electrons exchanged per O2 molecule, “F” is the Faraday constant (96 500 C mol–1), “CO2” is the bulk oxygen concentration (1.2 × 10–6 mol L–1), “DO2” is the diffusion coefficient of molecular oxygen
in 0.1 mol L–1 KOH solution (1.9 × 10–5 cm2 s–1), “ν” is
the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm2 s–1), and “ω” is the electrode rotation
speed in radians per second (=2πf = 2πrpm/60).
A plot of the inverse of current (i–1) as a function of the inverse of the square root of the rotation
rate (ω–1/2), which is known as the K–L
plot, is a useful method to analyze the ORR kinetic parameters of
an electrocatalyst. A comparison of the K–L plot of the various
samples at −0.49 V is shown in Figure 5c. It is evident from the figure that the
slope of the K–L plot changes along the series. This suggests
that the number of electrons involved in the ORR in the series changes
with Co concentration. In fact, at this potential, the number of electrons
involved for the ORR on Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ was found to be ∼3, whereas those
for BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ was ∼3.5 and for BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ was ∼3.9. The number of electrons (4
or 2) involved in the ORR mechanism decides whether the reaction proceeds
through a four-electron direct hydroxide pathway or two-electron peroxide
intermediate pathway. Direct reduction of oxygen to hydroxide via
the four-electron pathway is more efficient and desirable in the ORR.39 Hence, BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ with an electron-transfer number ∼4
and with more positive onset potential and the highest limiting current
density exhibits better ORR activity among the series of compounds.
The K–L plot of all the samples at different potentials is
shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information).

The number of electrons involved in the ORR mechanism for
all the
samples at different potentials was calculated from the K–L
equation. Figure 5d
demonstrates the dependence of the applied potential on the electron-transfer
number in these samples. It is clear from the figure that the number
of electrons involved in the ORR for BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ is in between 3.7 and 4, indicating
that the ORR in this system mainly proceeds via the four-electron
mechanism involving direct hydroxyl formation. However, on the other
hand, it is observed that the number of electrons involved in the
ORR on Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ is between 3 and 3.3. A value around 3 can be attributed to the
simultaneous reaction involving both two-electron peroxide intermediate
pathway and four-electron direct pathway.40 It is worthy to note that the ORR on BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ (n = ∼3.5) also
proceeds through both two- and four-electron pathways, but four-electron
direct reduction is more predominant. In addition to this, rotating
ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments were performed on BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ to get a
better insight into the mechanistic aspect of the ORR. Figure 6a represents the disk and ring
current obtained in the RRDE measurements. A negligible ring current
compared to the disk current gives a rough idea about the formation
of inferior intermediate peroxide (HO2–) during
the ORR process.

and (b)
corresponding percentage of the peroxide yield and the number of electron
transfer derived from the RRDE voltammogram for BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ in the presence of
O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a sweep rate of 10 mV s–1.

Further, the number of electrons
(n) involved
in the reaction pathway and the percentage of peroxide generated were
calculated from the RRDE data using the below equations:    where ID is the
disk current, Ir is the ring current,
and N = 0.38 is the current collection efficiency
of the Pt ring; the collection efficiency (N) was
calculated by using a simple reversible couple of a ferrocyanide/ferricyanide
system41 as reported in our previous studies.42 As evident from Figure 6b, RRDE results clearly show less than 12%
of the peroxide yield that gives a direct value of the number of electrons
involved in the ORR which ranges between 3.75 and 3.99 over the entire
range of a potential window.

The stability of the BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ catalyst was studied
by a chronoamperometric
stability (current vs time) test in alkaline media. As shown in Figure
S4a in the Supporting Information, the
BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ catalyst
exhibits better current response (only 10% loss) after 600 s; however,
under similar conditions, a commercial 40 wt % Pt/C catalyst reveals
more than 50% degradation. Further, the inset of Figure S4a demonstrates an almost 30 mV negative shift in
its half-wave potential after 2000 durable cycles, indicating poor
stability under alkaline conditions. On the other hand, a methanol
crossover test has been carried out in 1 M methanol in 0.1 M KOH solution
for 600 s. Importantly, in methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) there
is no considerable change in relative current with respect to time
even after the addition of methanol in 0.1 M KOH solution for the
BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ catalyst,
whereas the Pt/C catalyst exhibits major changes in relative current
values as evident from Figure S4b in the Supporting Information. Thus, the BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ catalyst shows better selectivity toward
ORR kinetics under alkaline media.

From these observations,
it is clear that the incorporation of
cobalt in the indium site of Ba2In2O5 improves the ORR activity of the sample. The ORR activity of Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ is considerably enhanced from that of the parent Ba2In2O5, although both the systems have oxygen vacancies
ordered in the alternate layers. Hence, the increase in the activity
is solely attributed to the incorporation of active Co sites in the
brownmillerite lattice. Further incorporation of Co, viz., BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ and BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ, results
in the loss of a brownmillerite structure and formation of a cubic
perovskite structure where the oxygen vacancies are randomly distributed
in the lattice. This composition with the highest Co concentration
exhibits the best ORR activity among the series. The enhancement in
the ORR activity is due to the enhanced concentration of cobalt, but
the role of random distribution of vacancies which will help in the
O2 adsorption cannot be ruled out. The role of oxygen vacancy
in the ORR is already reported in the literature and correlated to
the ease of O2 adsorption and oxide ion conduction.16,43 The enhanced surface area and improved conductivity will also contribute
to the better ORR activity of samples with a higher concentration
of Co. Further, the ORR activity of these samples can be enhanced
by heteroatom doping in the anionic site as observed in our previous
studies on anion doping in a Ca2Fe2O5 system.44 The ORR activity of BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ is comparable
with that of other perovskite-type oxides reported in the literature.
The ORR performance of some of the perovskite catalysts is given in
Table S3 (Supporting Information). On comparing
with the state-of-the-art 40 wt % Pt/C catalysts, the onset potential
of BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ is found to be 136 mV more negative (Figure S5, Supporting Information). However, high cost, scarcity, and
huge instability45 of the Pt-based catalyst
for the ORR in alkaline medium make them a poor choice in an alkaline
fuel cell. Hence, cost-effectiveness, improved stability, and scope
of fine-tuning these materials by different doping strategies make
them potential candidates for future fuel cell technology.

Conclusions
In summary, Ba2In2O5 brownmillerites
with Co doped progressively in the In site were synthesized and tested
for ORR activity in alkaline medium. Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ, with the least concentration
of Co, retained the brownmillerite structure with disorder in the
O3 site in the two-dimensional
alternate layer along the ab plane. However, higher
concentrations of Co in the site of Ba2In2O5, viz., BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ and BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ, lead to the loss of the brownmillerite structure, and the compound
attains the perovskite structure with oxygen vacancy distributed randomly
in the lattice. Both the cell length and cell volume gradually decreased
with increase in Co concentration owing to the smaller crystal radius
of Co when compared to that of In. XPS studies revealed that Co exists
in the +3 oxidation state in the sample. Interestingly, Co-doped samples
exhibited a far better ORR activity when compared to the parent Ba2In2O5 brownmillerite. They also exhibited
a well-defined LSV which was not observed in the parent Ba2In2O5 system. The enhanced activity of Co-doped
samples is attributed to the presence of catalytically active Co in
the lattice. Among the doped systems with increase in the Co concentration,
the ORR activity increases, which can be correlated to both the Co
concentration and the random distribution of oxygen vacancy in the
higher Co-doped systems. Also, the role of the improved surface area
and conductivity with increase in the Co concentration can be attributed
to the enhancement in the ORR activity in higher Co-doped samples.
Moreover, the Co concentrations are found to have an impact on the
reaction pathway. The parent brownmillerite is known to exhibit a
two-electron reaction pathway, which proceeds through a peroxide intermediate.
However, for Ba2In1.5Co0.5O5−δ, the number of electrons involved in the ORR was found to be ∼3,
indicating that both two-electron peroxide intermediate pathway and
four-electron direct pathway occur simultaneously. However, with increasing
Co concentration, the four-electron direct pathway predominates with
an electron-transfer number of ∼3.5 and ∼3.85 for BaIn0.5Co0.5O3−δ and BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ, respectively.
This was further confirmed by the RRDE measurements, which reveal
that the number of electrons involved in the reaction during the ORR
for the entire potential window was between 3.75 and 3.99 with a maximum
peroxide yield of 12%. Also, the samples were much more stable than
the commercial Pt/C. The composition BaIn0.25Co0.75O3−δ with the highest Co concentration exhibited
the best ORR activity among the series.

Experimental Section
All the samples with composition Ba2In2–xCoxO5−δ (x = 0.5, 1, and 1.5) were synthesized by the solid-state
method. High-purity BaCO3 (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich), In2O3 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and CoCO3 (Co 43–47%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as the starting materials.
Stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials were weighed and
ball-milled at 300 rpm for 3 h in a Fritsch Pulverisette 6 Planetary
Mill for homogeneous mixing. The samples were then calcined at 900
°C for 12 h. Subsequently, they were ground in a mortar and again
calcined at 1300 °C for 18 h at a slow heating rate with intermediate
grinding. The phase purities of all the samples were determined by
PXRD in a PANalytical X’Pert Pro dual goniometer diffractometer
with Ni-filtered Cu Kα at 40 kV and 30 mA and an X’celerator
solid-state detector with a step size of 0.008 and time per step 45.72
s. The diffraction pattern was obtained at room temperature in Bragg–Brentano
geometry. Lattice parameters of the samples were calculated by the
Rietveld refinement method in the PXRD pattern using GSAS–EXPGUI
program.46 The oxidation state of cobalt
in the samples was studied using XPS measurements carried out on a
VG Micro Tech ESCA 3000 instrument at a pressure of >1 × 10–9 Torr with a pass energy of 50 eV, an electron takeoff
angle of 60°, and an overall resolution of ∼0.1 eV. All
binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) arising
from adventitious carbon. The surface areas of the samples were determined
by N2 adsorption at the temperature of liquid nitrogen
using the Autosorb iQ Quantachrome system. The samples were degassed
at 300 °C under vacuum for 6 h prior to the analysis to remove
the adsorbed moisture on the catalyst surface. The specific surface
area was calculated using the BET model at a relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.05–0.3.

The EIS measurements were performed using a CHI604E electrochemical
analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc., USA). For making pellets for the measurement,
1 g of the synthesized oxide material was weighed and pressed in 13
mm pellet die. The ac impedance spectroscopy was performed over a
frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 MHz with an amplitude of 50 mV.

The electrochemical properties of the catalyst were measured by
CV and LSV techniques using a CHI760E electrochemical workstation
(CH Instruments, Inc., USA) in a conventional three-electrode test
cell with Hg/HgO and Pt wire as the reference and counter electrodes,
respectively, at room temperature. The catalyst was prepared by ball
milling (300 rpm for 90 min) with a mixture of the sample and Vulcan
XC-72 carbon in the ratio of 4:1. A slurry of the catalyst was prepared
by ultrasonically mixing 5.0 mg of the sample carbon composite in
960 μL of isopropanol–water (3:1) solution and 40 μL
of 5 wt % Nafion solution for 30 min to get a homogeneous suspension.
For preparing the working electrode for CV and RDE measurements, a
glassy carbon (GC) electrode was first polished using 0.05 μm
of alumina, and then the electrode was cleaned using Milli-Q water.
Catalytic slurry (4 μL) was loaded onto the surface of the GC
electrode of 3 mm diameter (0.0707 cm2 geometrical area).
The slurry was allowed to dry slowly at room temperature to obtain
a thin homogeneous catalyst film.47 The
final catalyst loading on the electrode surface (geometrical area
= 0.0707 cm2) was 283 μg cm–2.
An aqueous solution of 0.1 M KOH (Aldrich, ≥85%) was used as
the electrolyte for normal CV and RDE studies. Kinetics of ORRs of
the catalyst were studied by using RDE in 0.1 M KOH using a three-electrode
cell assembly at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 at 400,
900, 1200, 1600, 2000, and 2500 rpm at room temperature. The yield
of peroxide produced during the ORR and the number of electrons transferred
per oxygen molecule were calculated by RRDE measurements at 1600 rpm
in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution.
