Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is
a target-specific anticancer antibody-drug
conjugate (ADC). In the present study, critical quality attributes
for different manufactured products, such as the drug to antibody
ratio (DAR), conjugation site, and site conjugation ratio, are similar,
which is contrary to the traditional view that conjugation at lysine
sites is randomly assigned. To investigate this result, a series samples
with different DARs were prepared. Site conjugation ratios of the
27 different conjugation sites (corresponding to 54 potential sites)
were analyzed. We found that the correlation coefficients of the 26
site conjugation ratio and the DAR were R2 > 0.9, and the remaining one was R2 >
0.7. By comparing three batches of samples with a DAR value of ∼3.3
in a stability study, we found that degradation rates of conjugation
sites of the samples incubated at 40 °C were basically the same.
These data show that the conjugation ratio and the conjugation stability
of each site may remain consistent if the process parameters are stable.
LC/MS/MS was used to study the unconjugated linker of the crosslink
byproducts produced by a two-step method. We determined four forms
of unconjugated linkers: (N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate
(MCC) unconjugated to DM1, hydrolyzed MCC unconjugated to DM1, lys-MCC-lys,
and lys-MCC-cys. We believe that the current study can provide an
effective guide for the processing of ADCs, control of product quality,
and reduction of side reaction products.

==== Body
Introduction
Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have a
high degree of heterogeneity.1,2 Because conjugation
can occur in several but not all of the available
sites of antibodies, a particular ADC can contain multiple conjugation
molecules. Therefore, an ADC is a mixture of conjugated substances,
and appropriate tests are required to evaluate the heterogeneity and
ensure product consistency.3 To demonstrate
the consistency of an ADC, a comprehensive method needs to be established
to analyze the consistency of different batches of ADCs. It is important
to assess the consistency because even tiny structural differences
can significantly affect the safety and/or effectiveness of ADCs.4 The ADCs on market are derived from different
multiple batches not only in the process of clinical trails but after
the ADCs come into the market. Ensuring consistency between batches
enables better evaluation of the relationship of the ADCs and their
clinical outcomes, thereby eliminating the efficacy or safety risks
caused by quality differences among batches.

Trastuzumab emtansine
(T-DM1) is an ADC for human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer therapy,5,6 and it was approved by FDA in 2013 with the trade name Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab
emtansine) in 2013. Adotrastuzumab emtansine employs DM1, a semisynthetic
cytotoxic payload of the maytansinoid class, which is conjugated via
lysine residues (its primary amine group) of the antibody. Compared
to sugar chain conjugation, ADCs with site-specific properties derived
from nonnatural amino acid conjugation, disulfide conjugation, and
conjugation primary amine-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate
(MCC)–DM1-connected ADCs possess a high heterogeneity due to
rich conjugation sites of the antibody sequence. Therefore, the batch
quality must be strictly and thoroughly compared and assessed because
of the high heterogeneity of T-DM1.

As shown in Figure 1A, we studied the T-DM1 prepared
by a two-step method.7−9 First, the antibody was coupled with the bifunctional
linker succinimidyl
4-MCC (SMCC) to obtain the intermediate T-MCC. The remaining SMCC
and the derivative were then removed and DM1 was added to form a covalent
bond with the other functional group of the MCC moiety of the intermediate
to complete the conjugation processes. In the chemical conjugation
reaction, antibodies, toxin moieties, and SMCC varied with the process
parameters being fluctuated. All the process parameters such as pH,
temperature, stirring speed, buffer system, bioreactor texture, and
organic solvent will influence the quality of the final products.
For example, it is found in the process development that ADCs produced
in different temperatures, even with same drug to antibody ratio (DAR),
vary differently to a large extent in the site conjugation ratio.
Therefore, compared to the antibody, ADC heterogeneity is more complicated
to evaluate. In-depth equivalence assessment need to be addressed
in effective payload, conjugation sites, drug distribution, drug conjugation
stability, and unconjugated linker through more mass spectrometry
techniques.

Figure 1 (A) Schematic diagram of the conjugation process and (B) the equation
of MCC hydrolysis.

SMCC is a bifunctional
linker that not only acts as a bridge in
T-DM1 but also causes many side reactions.10−12 LC/MS/MS has
proven to be an efficient and powerful tool for studying these byproducts. Figure 2 shows the DAR that
was characterized by mass spectrometry after T-DM1 deglycosylation.
In addition to main peaks of the antibodies connected to a series
of DM1 separated with a 957 Da difference, there is a 222 Da difference
between adjacent main peaks. Chen et al.7 considered this peak as an active unreached maleate group of MCC.
Carrasco-Triguero et al.13 consider that
this is the reason why the active maleate group of MCC is linked to
another primary amine group of lysine on the antibody to form a crosslink.
The present study shows that unconjugated linkers exist in a variety
of forms. In addition to the two cases described above, the active
MCC maleimide group forms a maleimide-thiol conjugate with a free
disulfide bond to obtain another cross-linker.14 Furthermore, maleamides may be hydrolyzed and are not able
to undergo a Michael addition reaction with DM1 when hydrolyzed.15 Currently, the formation of metabolites during
pharmacokinetic reactions of T-DM1 has not been clarified, and the mechanism of metabolic product
formation needs to be further studied.16 As there are side reaction products of the unconjugated linker,
the existence and proportion of T-DM1 need to be well estimated and
strictly controlled.

Figure 2 (A) ADC profiles determined by ESI-TOF-MS when the N-glycosidase
reaction condition is strictly controlled at pH 7.4 for 3.5 hours,
the 0–7 DM1 conjugated components are clear to identify, D0∼D7:
0∼7 DM1-conjugated T-DM1; L: unconjugated linker. (B) Time
course displaying the molecular weight shift from ∼222 to ∼229Da
(Δmass of D1+L and D1).

In this study, we analyzed the heterogeneity of ADC batches
in
the aspects of the DAR, conjugated sites, drug distribution, and site-conjugation
stability. By adjusting the process parameters used to prepare different
samples, the relationship of the site conjugation ratio and process
parameters was studied, and the unconjugated linkers were identified.
This analysis is important for the production of lysine-conjugated
ADCs.

Results
Analysis of the DAR
The DAR, as
a critical quality
attribute, determines the payload of ADCs and is critical for evaluating
ADC heterogeneity.17,18 Intact MS has been widely recognized
as a fast and accurate method for characterizing the ADC drug load
curve. In T-DM1 analysis, the pH and duration of the enzyme-cutting
depeptide are the major factors of the drug distribution curve and
the unconjugated linker. Figure 2A shows that when the N-glycosidase
reaction condition is strictly controlled at pH 7.4 for 3.5 h, the
0–7 DM1-conjugated components are clear to identify. The molecular
weight difference between the main peaks is approximately 957 Da,
and the secondary molecular weight of the unconjugated link is shifted
by ∼222 Da. With the increase in deglycosylation time or pH,
although the molecular weight difference between the main peaks remained
∼957 Da, the sample DAR value decreased by ∼0.3 after
30 h of enzyme cutting, and the molecular weight shift from ∼222
to ∼229 Da (Figure 2B). In addition, the rate of DM1 shedding is accelerated in
the alkaline buffer required for deglycosylation, and the maleimide
group of SMCC hydrolyzed to +18 Da (Figure 1B). Because of the mass spectrum sensitivity
limitations, it is difficult to effectively isolate the two ∼145 000
Da antibody components with 18 Da differences, and the molecular weight
signal peaks of deconvolution of each mass spectrometry involve a
collection of similar molecular weight components with very small
differences. This explains why MCC molecular weight shift increased
due to hydrolysis.

Conjugation Process and DM1 Conjugation Site
Level
Four batches of T-DM1 processed with the same conjugation
parameters
and four batches of Kadcyla were conducted using characterization
analysis. Table 1 shows
that the difference of the DAR of the four batches is less than 0.1,
and the proportion of unconjugated linkers is ∼5%. By using
MCC–DM1 as a post translational modification (PTM), the chymotryptic
peptide conjugation site containing PTM19 was identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). 42 sites (corresponding
to 84 sites of the complete molecule, 4 sites of N-terminal amino
groups, and 80 lysine sites, Table 2) were identified with the 547 Da characteristic peak,20 mass error <10 ppm, no dehydration modification,
and adequate collision-induced dissociation (CID) as basic requirements
of conjugated peptide identification. 42 different differential sites
were all identified in the samples.

Because of the incomplete
signal of the unconjugated peptide at
the 15 conjugation sites, only 27 different conjugation sites from
four batches of samples (B-lot1-4) were counted and included in the
relative standard deviation (RSD) calculation (Table 3). The RSD of LC-126K was 12.02%, and the
RSD of the other 26 sites was less than 10%. This result indicates
that the conjugation level of the site under the same conjugation
process may also be relatively stable. To further validate the experimental
results, the conjugation rate of 27 sites of four different batches
of Kadcyla was analyzed (Table 3): only 5 sites had RSD > 10%: LC-103K, 25.40%; LC-126K,
54.97%;
HC-208K, 12.89%; HC-320K, 16.32%; and HC-395K, 19.52%. The 10% RSD
threshold was confirmed by analytical repeatability analysis. During
the test, a sample was divided into four, and the four subsamples
were prepared in parallel before analysis of the proportion of conjugation.
It was found that even when the pretreatment and characterization
analysis were the same, the differences in enzyme cutting and mass
spectrometry ionization efficiency resulted in a slight difference
in the proportion of conjugation at the same conjugation site. According
to statistics, the deviation due to instrumental and sample pretreatment
differences should not exceed 10%.

To further
understand the above findings, we strictly controlled
the conjugation reaction process parameters and contact materials:
buffer solution (pH 6.5), antibody concentration (12.5–13 mg/mL),
final N,N-dimethylacet amide (DMA)
concentration of 10%, temperature (25 °C), and stirring speed
(120 rpm); only the proportions of SMCC and DM1 were changed, samples
with DAR values of 1.10, 1.37, 1.62, 2.05, 2.08, 2.81 and 3.73 were
produced with the same batch of antibody (Table 1). The conjugation sites of all samples were
analyzed. The above 42 conjugation sites are confirmed for the sample
with DAR 3.73. In the low-DAR sample, 35 DM1 conjugation modification
sites are found. Furthermore, no different conjugation sites from
the previous sample were found in the above DAR gradient samples.
At the same time, we observed that with the DAR increased, the proportion
of each site increased accordingly.

Three different lysine conjugation
sites for the antibody N-terminal,
hinge regions, and Fc region were selected for further study (Figure 3). Take the HC-225K
site as an example, the conjugation ratios were 2.33, 2.94, 3.03,
4.08, 4.37, 6.19, and 8.39%, as shown in Figure 3. The data were fitted perfectly well with
the corresponding DAR values of seven samples, the regression model y = 0.025x – 0.0077, (R2 = 0.993) (Table 4). R2 represents the correlation
coefficient between the MS-DAR value and the site conjugation level.
The fitted curve is more linearly related when R2 is closer to 1. It is generally believed that when R2 > 0.8, the curve has a high linear correlation.
When 0.5 < R2 < 0.8, it is considered
that the curve fitted is shown as a significant straight line. This
result is vastly different from traditional recognition that lysine
conjugation is randomly reacted. To ensure the validity of the data,
the conjugation sites with incomplete unconjugated peptide signals
were removed, and linear analysis was performed on 27 conjugation
sites in all samples of gradient DAR.

conjugation site levels
(three different conjugation sites), taking the HC-225K site (the
blue line) as an example, the conjugation ratios were 2.33, 2.94,
3.03, 4.08, 4.37, 6.19, and 8.39%.

a Line 1 was calculated by seven results
of sample 1–7 and line 2 was calculated by seven results of
sample 1–7 and H-DM1. Slope is the slope of the fitted curve.
Sig P was the P-value of line 1
and line 2.

Table 4 shows R2 > 0.99 for nine sites, R2 >
0.95 for a total of 26 sites, R2 >
0.9 for all sites, and R2 of 0.785
for only one site LC-126K, the reason why R2 for site LC-126K is relatively lower is because the conjugation
level on this site is lower than other sites, it may be biased because
of a relatively higher coefficient of variance (CV) values. We introduce
the p value to determine the significance of the
regression model using regression analysis by IBM SPSS statistics
22. It is generally considered that p < 0.05 is
statistically significant, and when p < 0.001,
the regression model is extremely significant. The results showed p > 0.001 only for the LC-126K site and p < 0.001 for the remaining sites. These sites with different conjugation
ratios at different regions of the antibody sequence showed good linearity,
which also suggests that the small molecule conjugation efficiency
at each site under fixed process parameters is probably relatively
conservative.

During the study of the DAR gradient samples,
we prepared a sample
S-HLINK DAR 3.54 with the conditions that reaction temperature increased
and other parameters remain unchanged. At the same time, to investigate
the impact of antibodies to crosslink the reaction, herceptin-DM1
(H-DM1) DAR 3.12 (Table 1) was prepared by the standard crosslink process, and the MS-DAR
results show that S-HLINK’s unconjugated linkers are as high
as 31.83% and that they remains at ∼4% for H-DM1. This shows
that high temperatures have a great impact on the conjugation process.
Two samples’ conjugation sites were analyzed as data shown
in Table 4. The 27-site
conjugation rate of H-DM1 was substituted into the corresponding linear
equation, and the R2 and p values are generally consistent of both the initial equation and
new linear equation. The p value (Sig P, using univariate analysis of variance by IBM SPSS statistics 22)
of both slope differences is >0.5, showing no difference statistically.
The MS-DAR values of the S-HLINK samples and H-DM1 were substituted
into 27 initial equations, and the coefficients of variation (CV %
values) of the theoretical site conjugation ratio and the actual measured
values were calculated. The 26 H-DM1 sites have CV values < 10%,
the 9 S-HLINK sites have CV values > 10%, and the overall deviation
fluctuation is also larger for the 9 S-HLINK sites. We also adjusted
the pH of the crosslink buffer system to 7.5, and a large number of
unknown peaks was shown as characterized by MS of the product. It
was studied that SMCC was hydrolyzed and DM1 was cleaved because of
the long crosslink reaction in alkaline buffer.

The above results
prove that the efficiency of the batch conjugation
is consistent as long as the conjugation process is consistent and
the quality of the antibody is similar. However, if the key process
parameters of conjugation change, such as temperature and pH, the
site conjugation rate will change. Through analysis of the conjugation
ratio, the consistency between different batches of samples can be
analyzed.

Stability Study of the Conjugation Site
Stress tests
are often used to identify chemical degradation at each site of antibodies.8,21 If the quality of the ADC batches is consistent, the structural
stability of each batch should be comparable. We exposed three batches
of 100 g of T-DM1 (liquid form) to a high-temperature condition (40
°C) for 2 months to assess the rate of shedding at each conjugation
site.

Figure 4 shows that during the incubation time of T-DM1 at high temperatures,
the ultraviolet detection for drug to antibody ratio (UV-DAR) decreased
and the content of free small molecules in solution increased rapidly;
the trend of each batch was basically the same. After the sample incubation
at 40 °C for 10 days, intact MS detection signal was chaotic
and irregular and unable to conduct MS-DAR statistical analysis. According
to mass spectrum data analysis, the chaotic signal may be derived
from DM1 shedding in different ways resulting in variation of modified
molecules left on the lysine residues of the antibody, according to
the mass spectrometry analysis.

Figure 4 (A) Is degradation rate at each conjugation
site calculated by
UV-DAR, incubated at 40 °C over ∼62 day time period. (B)
Is time course displaying the free drug, incubated at 40 °C over
∼30 day time period, the sample contains all forms of free
drugs.

Figure 5 shows the
degradation rate at each conjugation site for 62 days determined by
peptide mapping. The data shows that the degradation rate at different
sites differs significantly. For example, the LC-126K site could not
be detected, while HC-417K degradation was only ∼28%, which
demonstrates that the shedding of DM1 is also related to the solvent-accessible
surface area of each conjugated site. Except the 6 sites with RSD
> 10%, the RSD of the remaining 21 sites was still below the threshold
of 10%. This result indicates that after the same conjugation reaction
procedure, the trend of the change in antibody quality remains the
same, and the physicochemical properties of the final products (T-DM1)
are also equivalent if the crosslink processes are the same.

Figure 5 Degradation
profile at each conjugation site (40 °C for 62
days) of B-Lot1, B-Lot2 and B-Lot3 determined by peptide mapping.
Degradation rate data are shown by mean ± standard error bar.

We find that with the UV-DAR decreasing
rate (Figure 4A), the
content increasing
rate of free small molecules (Figure 4B) and the corresponding degradation rate of the conjugation
site were not consistent. When incubated for 30 days at high temperature,
UV-DAR was reduced by ∼14%, and the free small-molecule content
was less than 5%. UV-DAR decreased by ∼28% when incubated for
62 days at high temperatures, whereas peptide analysis showed that
the majority of the conjugation site degradation rate had exceeded
50%. We perceive that if the shedding small molecules are not complete
DM1 molecules, the UV absorption of the solution will be biased because
the degradation rate determined by UV-DAR is the rate of the whole
sample containing degradative DM1 which cannot be removed, while peptide
analysis determines the degradation rate of each site. Peptide modification
analysis revealed that a large number of MCC–DM1 breaks at
the ether bond, and the shedding small molecules with a molecular
weight of 547 Da are characteristic fragments (Figure 6). In addition, long-term stability experiments
confirmed the presence of the corresponding peptide, which suggests
that the toxic moiety degradation of T-DM1 cannot be genuinely evaluated
merely by qualifying small free drug content or UV-DAR. LC/MS analysis
of the conjugation site ratio should be applied to determine the drug
payload.

°C over 62 days. The shedding small molecules with a molecular
weight of 547 Da are characteristic fragments.

Unconjugated Linker
The major side product in T-DM1
prepared by a two-step method is the unconjugated linker, it is formed
because the interval between the two reactions of the nucleophilic
substitution reaction and subsequent DM1 Michael addition reaction
is quite long, and there is an ultrafiltration exchange step to remove
the remaining SMCC, there is sufficient time for a side reaction of
the SMCC maleimide active group.22 Chen7 reports that the unconjugated linkers of the
sample are all lys-MCC-lys. However, the molecular weight of six crosslink
peptides increases by 222 Da instead of theoretical 219 Da, according
to the literature. Liuxi Chen8 identified
three sites which only connected to SMCC, they considered the unconjugated
linker existed in an activated/unreacted form of modified 219 Da,
according to the molecular weight shift of 222 Da of the unconjugated
linker in MS-DAR, we speculate that there is a modified form of hydrolyzed
MCC +237 Da.

First, we conducted a site modification analysis
of the highly unconjugated linker sample S-HLINK. A total of 11 sites
were found modification of 219 and 237 Da; however, it is difficult
to determine when the unbounded MCC is hydrolyzed. According to previous
research, maleimide can be hydrolyzed at high temperature and high
pH, which indicates that maleimide group may be hydrolyzed in the
crosslink reaction or during the pretreatment of the peptide analysis
sample, even during the high-temperature peptide mapping analysis
and thus result in a +237 Da modification but the 219 Da modification
indicates that the unconjugated linker has an active/unreacted form.

To find the potential cross-linkers, we modified all peptide sequences
of 42 sites with DM1 conjugation and set it only bind to MCC (i.e.,
+219 Da). A total of 42 modified peptide sequences were introduced
into the protein modification database of UNIFI MS software as a protein
modification. These long, crosslink peptides were characterized by
a high-energy collisional dissociation fragmentation technique. In
the UNIFI software analysis, a cross-linker-modified peptide was defined
as an α peptide, and the peptide identified as a protein modification
was defined as a β peptide. 18 sites were identified as the
lysine–MCC–lysine form and 1 lys-SMCC-cys (Table 5) by high-energy collision
dissociation analysis of highly unconjugated linker peptide fragments.
In an example (Figure 7), fragmentation of both α and β chains was observed
in the MS/MS spectrum. Bioconjugate techniques14 introduced that the reaction of maleimide with thiol groups
is 1000 times faster than the primary amine reaction at pH 7.0. When
the first step crosslink completed, the free maleimide group of MCC
can form a covalent bond with the primary amine that has a close spatial
position. In addition, when the mercapto group of the nearby cystine
side chain is free, MCC maleimide can rapidly form a cross-linked
covalent bond with it. Using the full-length IgG (PDB ID: 1HZH)23 crystal structure to extract the spatial distance of these
cross-linkers (Figure 8), it shows that the maximum distance of the amino acid residues
at both ends of the cross-linker in the hinge region is 30 Å,
and the distance between amino acid residues at both ends of the cross-linker
in the nonhinge region is not more than 15 Å. In this study,
the hinge area tends to be more flexible,24 which corresponds to that observed in previous studies.

sample and fragmentation of both α and β chains was observed

Based
on the above results, the unconjugated linker modification
of Kadcyla and the candidate biosimilar are identified. Additionally,
by detecting the retention time of the peptide and the m/z signal and comparing them to the identified cross-linker
signals, it was found that all 19 cross-linker forms exist. In addition,
both Kadcyla and the candidate biosimilar have the unconjugated linker
form of +219 and +237 Da.

Discussion
Considering
the fact that only a small proportion of heterogeneous
products can be used to objectively evaluate the acceptable treatment
window and relationship between the efficacy and toxicity of the drugs
because of the reason that toxic moieties conjugated to ADCs. Some
clinical trials failed because of safety problems caused by the toxicity
of toxic moieties. Accordingly, ADC developers strongly emphasize
conjugation processes. However, as they solve the connectivity conundrum,
scalability and other process concerns often emerge. Therefore, the
structural heterogeneity analysis of lysine-linked ADCs is extremely
important for the development of production technology. Although detection
methods, such as size-exclusion chromatography, differential scanning
calorimetry, capillary isoelectric focusing, and circular dichroism
spectroscopy have been widely used to assess the molecular physicochemical
properties in terms of thermodynamics, charge, and hydrophobicity,
we do not have a clear understanding of the microscopic drug conjugation
sites. It is reported that drug conjugation sites can significantly
affect linker stability and antibody localization.25,26 Thus, detailed in-depth structural characterization is an important
part of the quality assessment of lysine-linked ADCs. In this study,
we used MS-based technology to obtain the structural information of
the T-DM1 candidate drug and Kadcyla (in addition to the literature)
and analyzed the relationship between the conjugation sites and the
process through statistical analysis.

The conjugation sites,
DM1 conjugation site ratio, and the unconjugated
linker are the characteristic properties of an ADC, all of which reflect
the possible distribution of conjugation sites of the toxic moieties
and the side effects in the crosslink reaction process. According
to the number of conjugation sites, the identified 42 sites are distributed
in all samples. Regarding the proportion of conjugation sites, although
the degree of ionization of different peptides is different, this
is only a relative proportion. According to the statistical analysis
of 27 sites, four batches of T-DM1 drug candidates have consistent
conjugation ratios, except for slight differences in the conjugation
ratios at one site, their conjugation ratios of the remaining sites
are consistent, and the consistent chemical stability of the interbatch
conjugation sites was also demonstrated in the thermal stability studies.
Unconjugated linkers are the main side-reaction products during the
conjugation process. For four batches of ADCs, the percentage of coupled
linkers ranges from 4.3 to 5.1%. We identified four forms of unconjugated
linkers, and in particular, the two forms of crosslinks that would
affect the advanced structure of drug molecules. The above information
shows that under the strict control of the conjugation process, each
lysine site results in the same conjugation ratio and the same side
reaction level, and the interbatch consistency of ADCs can be ensured.

Over time, for all lysine-linked ADC conjugation sites, the identification
of lys residues as conjugation sites for small molecules increased
from 47 to 90%. Thus, we believe that, unlike the traditional concept,
the attachment of small molecules may be distributed over all lys
residues, and the ratio of solvent exposure at each site is directly
related to the efficiency of the site conjugation and shedding rate.
With the development of mass spectrometry techniques, it is possible
to identify small fractional conjugations at all lys sites. ADCs are
an emerging technology relative to antibody drugs. However, more efforts
and time are needed to overcome technical barriers. Only when industry
and regulators learn from each other, a more effective platform process
can be developed and applied in parallel with the regulatory framework.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the relationship between the conjugation sites and
the manufacturing technology has been elucidated and forms of unconjugated
linkers have been identified. We find that the physicochemical properties
of the final products (T-DM1) are equivalent if the crosslink processes
are the same and that the UV-DAR decreasing rate, the content increasing
rate of free small molecules, and the corresponding degradation rate
of the conjugation site were not consistent. Also, we find that the
conjugation efficiency and the conjugation stability of each site
remain consistent if the process parameters are stable. Our findings
may provide an evidence as an effective guide for manufacturing of
ADCs and thus decrease side production during reaction in addition
to have a good control of the product quality.

Materials and Methods
Sample
and Materials
Kadcyla and Herceptin were purchased
from Genentech Roche. Naked IgG1 mAb Trastuzumab was manufactured
by Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). DM1
was obtained from Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Inc. Sequencing grade-modified
trypsin and Asp-N were purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison,
WI, USA).

Sample Preparation for Intact LC/MS
ADC samples were
diluted to a concentration of 4 mg/mL in 100 μL of 1 M tris-HAc
buffer (pH 7.8). Then, 2.5 μL of glycerol-free PNGase F (New
England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) solution was added to each sample,
followed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h.

Intact LC/MS
Deglycosylated
ADC was desalted using
a Waters Mass PREPTM Micro Desalting VanGuardTM precolumn (2.1 ×
5 mm) on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC H-Class Bio system. The mobile phase
consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water (phase A) and 0.1% formic
acid in acetonitrile (ACN) (phase B) was delivered at a flow rate
of 0.3 mL/min using a 6 min gradient program from 5% (B) to 100% (B).
The column temperature was set to 70 °C. The eluent was diverted
into a Waters Xevo G2S Q-TOF mass spectrometer for analysis. The capillary
voltage for the Q-TOF was set at 3 kV, and the cone voltage was set
at 120 V. The source and desolvation temperatures were 150 and 350
°C, respectively. The MS spectra were collected at 1 spectrum
per second, and the Q-TOF analyzer was set to scan from m/z 200 to 4000. The mass spectra were then deconvoluted
and analyzed using the UNIFI Scientific Informatics System (version
1.8) software.

Drug-to-Antibody Ratio
The relative
MS responses for
peaks observed in the resultant deconvoluted spectra were employed
for DAR calculations. The first peak in the deconvoluted ADC spectrum
was assigned as deconvoluted trastuzumab, D0. The following peaks
were assigned as D1-7 based on an averaged mass difference of 957
Da (DM1 with linker). The second series of less abundant peaks observed
were separated by an offset of approximately +222 Da. They are unconjugated
linkers, assigned as D1+L to D7+L. The average DAR was calculated
using eq 1, where i denotes the drug load for each
mAb isoform

500 mM iodoacetamide stock solution to a final concentration of 20
mM, and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Buffer
exchange (0.1 M Tris, 2 M urea, pH 7.8) was performed using an NAP-5
column (GE Healthcare, Wilmington, MA, USA). Sequencing grade-modified
lys/trypsin was added to each sample (enzyme-to-protein ratio, 1:25,
w/w), and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The digested
peptide mixture was diluted to 0.45 mM. Leucine enkephalin (LeuEnk,
sequence YGGFL) was added to the mixture at the final concentration
of 0.05 mM. The injection volume for each LC/MS run was 10 μL.

Peptide Mapping LC/MS
Mobile phase A was prepared with
water containing 0.1% formic acid, while mobile phase B was prepared
with acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Peptides from protein digests
were separated on an ACQUITY UPLC peptide column (2.1 × 100 mm
BEH C18 column, 1.7 μm) using a 115 min linear gradient at a
flow rate of 0.300 mL/min from 2 to 45% (B). The column temperature
was set to 70 °C. For the data acquisition during the peptide
analysis, a Xevo G2S Q-TOF mass spectrometer was operated either in
MSE or Fast DDA mode. The capillary voltage for the Q-TOF was set
at 3 kV, and the cone voltage was set at 60 V. The source and desolvation
temperatures were 120 and 400 °C, respectively. The MS spectra
were collected at a rate of 1 spectrum per second, and the Q-TOF analyzer
was set to scan from m/z 50 to 2000.
For the MSE mode, the instrument alternated between low-energy and
high-energy scans (0.4 s per scan), which were used to generate intact
peptide ions (from low-energy scans) and peptide product ions (from
high-energy scans). A collision energy ramp between 25 and 65 V was
used for fragmenting peptides in the high-energy scans.

Relative Site
Occupancy Calculation
The raw LC/MS data
for peptide analysis were processed using the UNIFI Scientific Informatics
System (Version 1.8) to generate precursor masses and the associated
product ion masses (charge state reduced and de-isotoped) for subsequent
protein identification and quantification. The following criteria
were used to identify the conjugated peptides during the current analysis:
(1) mass accuracy for the matched precursors must be within 5 ppm
of mass error; (2) at least three primary fragment ions must be matched
for each mass-confirmed peptide; and (3) signature fragments (m/z 547.221) must correspond to the drug
payload and are observed for identification of conjugated peptides.

For peptide quantification, extracted ion chromatogram peak areas
that correspond to all the charge states along with all the specified
adduct ions of each peptide (e.g., sodiated adducts) were combined
as a single measure to quantify the abundance of the peptide and its
conjugated isoforms. All the peak areas were normalized against the
peak areas of the spiked-in internal standards, and triplet injections
were performed for each sample. The relative site occupancy from digestion
was calculated as the ratio of the conjugated peptide peak area to
the total peptide peak area using eq 2  

Free Drug Analysis
The ADC samples
(200 μL each)
were treated with 400 μL of cold methanol and incubated for
30 min in an ice bath. The samples were then centrifuged at 13 000
rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to further analysis
using RP (ZORBAX Eclipse Plus 95 Å C18, 4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5
μm) liquid chromatography. The standard curve was generated
using serial dilution of a DM1 standard stock solution. The free DM1
amount was calculated by eq 3 as follows: free DM1 % = moles of free
DM1/(moles of ADC × DAR).

Protocol for Conjugation
A solution of SMCC was prepared
in DMA at a concentration of approximately 20 mM, and a solution of
DM1 was prepared in DMA at a concentration of approximately 10 mM.
Trastuzumab at a concentration >12 mg/mL was displaced in buffer
A,
pH 6.5 (buffer A = 50 mM PB, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5). Based
on the estimated reagent scale, DMA was slowly added, followed by
a 2- to 10-fold molar excess of the SMCC solution. The conjugation
reaction was carried out using approximately 10 mg/mL trastuzumab
with 10% DMA in buffer A, pH 6.5, and continued for 2 h. Excess SMCC
was removed by gel filtration using a Sephadex G25 desalting resin
with buffer A. Under stirring, DMA was slowly added, followed by a
2- to 7-fold molar excess of the DM1 solution, such that the final
content of organic cosolvent was 10%. The reaction was allowed to
proceed for 3 h, and the product was purified by the G25 desalting
resin.
