==== Body
We found some errors, so we would like
to correct errors and add some points in our original article, which
was already published. Additions and corrections to the article are
given below.

Page 13647, first paragraph: “...secretion
of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone” should read “secretion
of thyroid-stimulating hormone.

Page 13649: Scheme 2 title should
read “Synthesis of N-Boc-3-(Thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine 4aa.

Page 13649, Scheme 3 footnote: “(b) N-formylmorpholine,
Et2O” should read “(b) N-formylmorpholine, n-BuLi, Et2O”.

Page 13651, Scheme 6 footnote: “(b) HCl or TFA or p-TsOH·H2O, 0–50 °C”
should read “(b) HCl or TFA or p-TsOH·H2O, 0 to 50 °C”.

Page 13652, “oral
administration of TRH and TRH mimetics at a dose of 50 and 5 μmol/kg”
should read “oral administration of TRH and TRH mimetics at
a dose of 50 and 10 or 5 μmol/kg”.

Page 13653,
Table 1, footnote c should read “cEffective dose for increasing rectal body temperature by 1 °C
per h (nmol/°C/kg body weight) in reserpine-induced hypothermia
mice. Each value represents the mean ± SD of at least three animals.
Administration dose: 50 μmol/kg for TRH, 10 μmol/kg for
compounds 65, 67, 69, 73, 75, 76, 77, and 78, 5 μmol/kg for compounds 1, 59, 64, 66, 68, and 70. The formula for computation is as follows: AUC0–7h: Area under the rectal temperature–time curve for 7 h. Administration
dose (50, 10, or 5 μmol/kg) × 7 h/[(AUC0–7h of test compounds temperature at time 0 × 7 h of test compounds)
– (AUC0–7h of saline temperature at time
0 × 7 h of saline)]”.

Page 13654, Table 2, footnote
f should read “fNC: Not calculated.

Page 13661: “after oral administration of TRH and TRH mimetics
up to 7 h after a dose of 50 and 5 μmol/kg/mL” should
read “after oral administration of TRH and TRH mimetics up
to 7 h after a dose of 50 and 10 or 5 μmol/kg/mL”.

Page 13663, Abbreviation paragraph: “TSH, thyrotropin-stimulating
hormone” should read “TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone”.

Below are shown the corrected Scheme 10 and Table 1.
