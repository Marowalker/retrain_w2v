In this work, a series of porous
carbon materials (PCs) were obtained
at different carbonization temperatures (800, 900, 1000, and 1100
°C) by a simple and fast solvent-free method. Moreover, the feasibility
of PCs as reliable and efficient adsorbents to capture diclofenac
sodium (DCF) from the water was evaluated. Notably, porous carbon
(PC) prepared at 1000 °C (PC-1000) was found to be the best candidate
for the adsorption of DCF. Remarkably, adsorption equilibrium was
achieved within 3 h, which followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic
model with a high correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.994). Furthermore, experimental data obtained from
adsorption
isotherm indicated that the capture of DCF onto PC-1000 followed the
Langmuir adsorption model (R2 > 0.997),
wherein its maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 392 mg/g.
In addition, based on the results obtained from the zeta potential
of PC-1000 under different pH and the adsorbed quantity of DCF along
with functional groups created on the surface of PC-1000, electrostatic
and H-bonding interactions were proposed as the possible adsorption
mechanisms. Due to its high stability and excellent reusability, PC-1000
has been testified as a promising candidate for removing DCF from
contaminated water.

Introduction
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs are effective anti-inflammatory,
antirheumatic, analgesic, antipyretic, and anticoagulant.1,2 Also, they are one of the most widely used anti-inflammatory drugs
in the world.3,4 Inevitably, they are easily being
released into the environment through direct discharge of domestic
sewage and industrial wastewater due to their broad applications.5 Since nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are
lipophilic and nonbiodegradable,6 they
can result in a series of serious environmental problems.2 Diclofenac sodium (DCF), one of the most consumed
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,7 has
been frequently detected in wastewater and natural water, wherein
its concentrations in rivers and groundwater were found in the range
of ng/L to g/L.8 Due to its high water
solubility (5000 mg/L) and low log Kow (1.56),9 DCF is not easy to remove from
water in conventional water treatment plants.10,11 Thus, in general, they may still exist in the treated effluents.12−14 Worse still, even at a low concentration, the continuous emission
of DCF into environment will cause serious toxic effects on aquatic
organisms. In addition, accumulation through food chain will pose
a great threat to other organisms and human health.15,16 Therefore, it is extremely important to develop a simple and efficient
method for removing it from the polluted water.

Compared to
existing treatment techniques, such as biodegradation,17 advanced oxidation processes,18−20 and electrochemical
degradation,21 adsorption stands out because
of its high efficiency and simple operation.22−25 For instance, compared to photocatalysis,
adsorption will not be limited by light and in some cases, the adsorbed
target could be recovered. Adsorption has been widely used for contaminants
treatment, including pharmaceuticals,26 heavy metals,27 and dyes.28 So far, several carbonaceous materials, such
as carbon nanotube,29−31 graphene,32,33 activated carbon,34 and porous carbon (PC),35−37 have been exploited
to remove nonsteroidal drugs from water.38,39 Among them, PCs have received increasing attention due to their
high hydrophobicity, large specific surface area, high thermal/chemical
stability, and relatively low cost.40,41 Presently,
there are many methods for the construction of PCs. In general, the
hard- and soft-template syntheses are two of the most commonly used
methods. However, these syntheses involved the preparation of precursors,
which were carried out under hydrothermal, solvothermal, or ionic
heat conditions, requiring a large number of solvents or high reaction
pressure.42−44 As a consequence, neither its environmental impact,
process safety, energy consumption, nor production cost is sufficient,
which has resulted in difficulties in practical applications.45 Compared with the traditional solvent-involved
method, in addition to producing less pollution and waste, the solvent-free
method has the advantages of being easy to operate and time-saving.46 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop
a solvent-free method for preparing PC.

Recently, Zhang et al.47 synthesized
a nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) without employing
any solvent or catalyst. The specific surface area of OMCs was >1000
m2/g. Yet, Yu et al.48 prepared
a carbon material with a high specific surface area (1340 m2/g) by polymerizing phenol (P) and formaldehyde (F) under high salt
condition (ZnCl2) and subsequent high-temperature carbonization.49 These results indicated that solvent-free strategy
was promising for PC preparation.

In the current work, PC materials
were prepared by a solvent-free
preparation method via pyrolyzing the mixture of hydroquinone, hexamethylenetetramine
(HMTA), Pluronic F127, and ZnCl2. Remarkably, Pluronic
F127 and ZnCl2 were used as the soft and hard template,
respectively. Meanwhile, hydroquinone was employed as the carbon source,
and HMTA was thermally decomposed into ammonia and formaldehyde, which
were utilized as the in situ N-dopant and the cross-linking agent,
respectively. The templates of ZnCl2 and Pluronic F127
could be removed and converted to carbonaceous residues, respectively,
during the process of high-temperature carbonization. The adsorption
properties of the PCs over DCF were investigated. The influence of
environmental interference factors (ions strength and humic acid)
was also explored. Furthermore, a plausible adsorption mechanism was
discussed based on the influences of the amounts of acidic functional
groups and the zeta potential of PCs on the adsorption performance.

Results
and Discussion
XRD, Raman, and N2 Adsorption–Desorption
Measurements
To confirm the structure of PCs, XRD and Raman
spectroscopy characterizations
were performed primarily. As shown in Figure 1a, two broad diffraction patterns appeared
at about 26 and 44o, which correspond to the amorphous
carbon and the graphitized carbon (100) plane, respectively, indicating
the successful preparation of the carbon materials. As the temperature
increased, the peak intensity of the graphitized carbon was gradually
enhanced. Furthermore, no phase of elemental Zn or ZnCl2 was observed in the XRD spectrum, indicating that Zn might exist
at very low concentrations or is completely eliminated during the
process of carbonization. It was inferred that first, ZnCl2 is converted into ZnO nanocrystals during the heating process, and
then the derived ZnO was transformed into Zn due to the carbothermal
reduction; finally, Zn was removed via evaporation at high temperature
owing to its low boiling point.48 As shown
in Figure S1 and Table S1, XPS analysis
also confirmed that the zinc content of PCs was almost negligible
(<0.4 wt %). Figure 1b shows the Raman spectrum of the prepared PCs. The D peak at ∼1350
cm–1 represents the amorphous carbon or defective
carbon, and the G peak at ∼1590 cm–1 represents
the graphitized carbon. It could be clearly seen from the figure that
as the temperature increased, the ID/IG value gradually decreased, indicating that
the degree of graphitization was gradually enhanced. It was consistent
with the results of XRD analysis, which indicated that the increase
in carbonization temperature resulted in increased structural order
of carbon materials.50

isotherms, and (d) BJH pore-size distributions

The texture characteristics
of the PCs and FC-1000 were investigated
by N2 adsorption–desorption analysis, and the obtained
data confirmed that the PCs had a highly microporous structure but
FC-1000 had a macropore structure (Figure 1c,d and Table S2). As shown in Figure 1c, according to the IUPAC classification,51 the isotherms of PCs can be classified as type
I, which confirmed the existence of micropores. However, that for
FC-1000 is found to be Type II with a hysteresis loop type H3, which
indicated that FC-1000 might be composed of aggregated nonporous particles
and the aggregation of nanosized particles formed the interparticle
voids (macropores).52 It could be seen
from Table S2 that the specific surface
areas of the synthesized PCs were 922.1 to 1235.7 m2/g
(SBET: PC-1000 > PC-1100 > PC-900 > PC-800), which
were
much larger than that of FC-1000 (744.3 m2/g). The values
were equivalent to or even exceeded the PCs reported in the works
of literature, such as oxidized activated carbon (704 m2/g)40 and commercial activated carbon
(865 m2/g).53 This phenomenon
was attributed to the fact that the evolution of Zn during carbonization
accelerated the development of the pores.54 Besides, PC-800 and PC-900 had a similar specific surface area and
pore volume, which were much smaller than those of PC-1000 and PC-1100.
It was conjectured that some volatile fractions were decomposed and
softened, forming an intermediate melt in the pores, but increasing
carbonization temperature results in pore expansion or coalescence
of neighboring pores to reduce the intermediate melt’s influence
into pore volume and surface area due to partial blockage.54−56

SEM and TEM Measurements
To investigate the morphology
and pore structure of PC-1000, SEM and TEM characterizations were
employed. As shown in Figure 2a,b, PC-1000 had a well-developed and uniform porous structure.
It could also be seen from the TEM images that PC-1000 has well-distributed
and abundant porous structures. The porous structure of the carbon
material can result from the vacancies left by the migration and evaporation
of PF127 and Zn during the high-temperature carbonization.

and (c, d) TEM images showing the microstructure of
PC-1000.

Choice of Adsorbents
To gain insight into the influence
of carbonization temperature and ZnCl2 on the adsorption
performance of carbon materials, the adsorption properties of carbon
materials toward pharmaceutical pollutants were investigated by taking
DCF as a model substrate. As illustrated in Figure 3, PC-1000 showed a better adsorption capacity
than other PCs, which could be attributed to the significant influence
of the surface area and pore volume of the adsorbents. Since ZnCl2 was generally believed to function as a dehydrating agent,57 it is suggested that ZnCl2 promotes
dehydration reactions of the phenolic resin, which results in aromatization
of the carbon skeleton with the concomitant generation of a pore structure.58 To further investigate the effect of ZnCl2, the adsorption performance of FC-1000 toward DCF was also
investigated. As shown in Figure 3, the adsorption capacity of PC-1000 for DCF was much
larger than that of FC-1000. This also confirms that ZnCl2 functionalized as a porogen can improve the specific surface area
of PCs, leading to an improvement of its adsorption performance. However,
it is worth noting that the surface area and pore volume of PC-1100
were similar to those of PC-1000, but their adsorption performance
differed. Therefore, the results confirmed that the adsorption capacity
of the material for DCF was affected by other factors such as type
and quantity of its functional groups in addition to the surface area
and pore volume (this will be further discussed in the section of
adsorption mechanism). Considering energy consumption and adsorption
performance, PC-1000 was selected as an optimized adsorbent for subsequent
experiments. As shown in Figure S2, 5 mg
was selected as the optimum adsorbent amount for DCF adsorption.

properties of different materials toward DCF (conditions:
dosage = 5 mg/50 mL, C0 (DCF) = 50 mg/L, T = 25 °C, t = 6 h.).

Adsorption Kinetics and Isotherms
To determine the
time required for adsorption equilibrium, the effect of contact time
on the adsorption of DCF onto PC-1000 was observed. As shown in Figure 4a, the adsorption
equilibrium for DCF over as-prepared PC-1000 could be obtained within
3 h. The experimental data were analyzed using pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order models (Supporting Information). The parameters
are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Figure S3, the pseudo-second-order
model with a higher linear correlation (R2 > 0.994) was more suitable to describe the adsorption of DCF
over
PC-1000 compared to the pseudo-first-order model. In addition, the
calculated Qe value obtained from the
pseudo-second-order kinetic model was more closely related to the
experimental value, indicating that the rate control step was mainly
chemical adsorption.59

(t = 6 h) over adsorption (conditions: dosage = 5

The
effect of initial DCF concentration on adsorption was also
investigated. The obtained isotherm, as shown in Figure 4b, revealed that the amount
of the DCF adsorbed onto the PC-1000 gradually ascended before reaching
a steady state. The Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal models were
utilized for data simulation (details can be found in the Supporting
Information). The parameters and the fitting curves are shown in Table 2 and Figure S4, respectively. The linear correlation coefficient
for the Langmuir model (R2 > 0.997)
was
higher than that of the Freundlich model (R2 > 0.864), indicating that the single-layer chemisorption played
a dominant role in the adsorption process.66 As could be seen from Table 2, the value of maximum adsorption capacity (Q0) was 392 mg/g at 25 °C. Table 3 shows the performance of the reported DCF
adsorbents; the as-prepared PC-1000 had equal or even better performance
than the other adsorbents. These results illustrated that PC-1000
was powerful and well suited for efficient and rapid removal of DCF
from wastewater.

Possible Adsorption
Mechanism
Understanding the adsorption
mechanism is vital to the adsorbent for its performance optimization
and commercial application. The results obtained in this study from
the adsorption of DCF by the synthesized PC (Figure 3 and Table S2)
indicated that there was another specific interaction between DCF
and PC in addition to the surface area of the adsorbent. When the
solution’s initial pH was lower than the pKa of the diclofenac acid (4.2), the DCF exists in its
neutral form; thus, its solubility is low (<3.6 mg/L).67 Therefore, to study the effect of pH on the
adsorption of DCF on PCs, solutions with a final concentration of
50 mg L–1 was prepared in the pH range of 5 to 12.

To gain insight into its adsorption mechanism, the effect of solution’s
initial pH on the adsorption of DCF and zeta potentials of PC-1000
was studied first. Of particular concern is that both the state of
the adsorptive and the adsorbent are affected by the pH of the solution.
As shown in Figure 5, both of the zeta potential and adsorption capacity decreased with
the increase in pH, indicating that the electrostatic interaction
was critical.68 In particular, DCF has
a negative charge at pH > 4.2. On the other hand, the surface of
PC-1000
was negatively charged under such condition, and the surface charge
decreased with pH increase. These results were similar to those reported
for other PCs used for DCF uptake.69 If
the adsorption was primarily motivated by electrostatic interaction,
the amount of adsorbed DCF could be negligible at high pH condition.
However, the experimental results showed that PC-1000 still had considerable
adsorption capacity for DCF. Therefore, some other factors that contributed
to adsorption should be taken into consideration.

Figure 5 Effect of pH on adsorption
(conditions: dosage = 5 mg/50 mL, C0 (DCF)
= 50 mg/L, T = 25 °C, t = 6
h) and zeta potential of PC-1000.

Previous studies had confirmed that aromatic compounds such as
DCF could be adsorbed onto porous materials (such as carbon nanotubes70 and PC65) due to
the contribution of π–π stacking interaction between
the benzene rings of frameworks and DCF. In this study, electrostatic
interactions and possible π–π interactions did
not adequately explain the amount of DCF adsorbed by PC-1000. Although
the surface area of PC-1100 was similar to that of PC-1000, the adsorption
capacity was not as good as that of PC-1000, which indicated that
the surface groups of PCs also played an important role. As shown
in Table S3, there were carboxylic acid
(pKa = 4.2), lactone, and phenolic (pKa =10.0) groups on the surface of the adsorbents.
Meanwhile, the absorption peaks corresponding to the carboxylic group
at 1650 and 1400 cm–1 and lactone group at 1330
to 1050 cm–1 were observed in the infrared spectrum
of PC-1000 (see Figure S5). The value of qt that decreased with increasing pH (Figure 5) could be explained
by the increase in the negative surface charge of the adsorbent and
the number of deprotonated species (COO– and O–) of the DCF. Under these conditions, electrostatic
repulsion between negative DCF and adsorbents increased at high pH.
Additionally, compared to PC-1100, PC-1000 with more carboxylic acid
groups exhibited a better adsorption performance for DCF under natural
pH, providing further evidence for the presence of electrostatic interactions.
In addition, due to the presence of abundant polar groups on adsorbents
and DCF, hydrogen bonding interactions may occur between adsorbents
and DCF. Phenol/carboxylic acid protons could pass hydrogen bonding
with carbonyl and carboxylate functional groups (protonation) or deprotonated
oxygen atoms to form attractive interactions, which have been observed
by some of the previously reported works.41,71 Therefore, electrostatic, π–π stacking and hydrogen
bonding interactions may be plausible mechanisms for efficient capture
of DCF. The schematic diagram of adsorption mechanism at the molecular
level is showed as follows (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Schematic diagram of adsorption mechanism at the molecular
level.

Effect of Humic Acid
Considering the complexity of
the actual wastewater sample, the effect of humic acid (HA), which
is widely presented in the actual wastewater, on adsorption was evaluated.
As shown in Figure 7, the HA has little effect on the adsorption of DCF by PC-1000. This
result was due to the low adsorption affinity of PC-1000 for HA. Thus,
the PC-1000 could be used as a promising adsorbent for contaminant
treatment.

Figure 7 Effect of humic acid (conditions: dosage = 5 mg/50 mL, C0 (DCF) = 50 mg/L, T = 25 °C, t = 6 h).

Reusability of Adsorbents
Reusability is an important
indicator to evaluate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of any
adsorbent. The reusability of PC-1000 for DCF removal was confirmed
by solvent (0.1 mol/L NaOH in methanol) washing followed by repeated
drying by vacuum. To authenticate that the PC-1000 successfully adsorbed
DCF, the FT-IR spectra of PC-1000 (fresh, adsorbed DCF and reused)
and DCF were collected (Figure S5). The
FT-IR spectra of fresh PC-1000, DCF, and DCF-adsorbed PC-1000 are
shown in Figure S5. The peaks of DCF were
observed on the DCF-adsorbed PC-1000, which verified that DCF was
adsorbed onto PC-1000 successfully. At the same time, the FT-IR spectrum
of the reused PC-1000 showed a similar frequency band to the original
one, indicating successful removal of the adsorbed DCF. The repeatability
test was carried out for five cycles, and the results obtained are
shown in Figure 8.
After the cycles, the amount of DCF adsorbed by PC-1000 was negligibly
reduced, indicating that PC-1000 had very good stability and reusability.
Hence, PC-1000 can be considered as an easy-to-prepare, recyclable,
and competitive adsorbent for removing drug contaminants from water.

ability of PC-1000 for DCF (conditions: dosage = 5 mg/50
mL, C0 (DCF) = 50 mg/L, T = 25 °C, t = 6 h).

Practical Application
The adsorbent was applied to
treat the lake water samples from two lakes (East Lake and Fruit Lake,
Wuhan), and the sampling sites were located around the hospitals.
Before adsorption, the samples were filtrated with a syringe filter
(polytetrafluoroethylene, hydrophobic, 0.45 μm). The results
are shown in Figure 9 and Tables 4 and 5. Adsorption peaks centered around 276 nm were observed
for both samples, indicating the presence of contaminants. A spiked
experiment was also designed for both samples. Remarkably, 5 mg of
adsorbent was put into 50 mL of solution, and the resulting mixture
was incubated at 25 °C for 6 h under shaking. Then, the filtered
solution was tested. The results showed that PC-1000 could successfully
remove the contaminants in the actual water samples with high efficiency
(Table 5).

Conclusions
In
short, we have successfully established a simple, fast, solvent-free
one-pot process for the preparation of PCs. The prepared PCs had a
rich microporous structure, high specific surface area, and excellent
thermal/chemical stability as well as remarkable adsorption properties
toward drug contaminants in aqueous solution. Moreover, it possessed
very good reusability for DCF removal. We are firmly convinced that
this work can improve the feasibility of the PCs as an effective candidate
for removing drug contaminants from aqueous solutions.

Materials and
Methods
Chemicals
Zinc chloride (≥98%), hexamethylenetetramine
(HMTA), methanol, and hydroquinone were obtained from Sinopharm Chemistry
Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Pluronic F127 and humic acid
(HA) were obtained from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Diclofenac sodium
(DCF) was obtained from Macklin (Shanghai, China). N2 (99.99%)
was supplied by the Oxygen Co. of WISCO (Wuhan, China). All the chemicals
were of analytical grade and utilized as received.

Preparation
of PC
Hydroquinone (0.5 g), 0.15 g of HMTA,
1.25 g of Pluronic F127, and 3 g of ZnCl2 were placed in
a mortar and ground at room temperature for 10 min to make them uniformly
mixed. Then, the mixture was placed in the center of a 5 × 3
cm porcelain boat; the porcelain boat was placed in a tube furnace,
calcined at 160 °C for 2 h under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere,
calcined at 360 °C for 2 h to remove Pluronic F127, and then
heated to 800 °C for 2 h to carbonize. Finally, it was naturally
cooled to room temperature, and the product PC was collected. The
carbonization temperatures were changed to 900, 1000, and 1100 °C
to explore the optimum synthesis temperature, where the remaining
conditions were unchanged. The obtained PC was referred to as PC-T,
where T represented the carbonization temperature. To further investigate
the effect of ZnCl2 on the material synthesis, a porous
carbon named FC-1000 was prepared at 1000 °C without ZnCl2.

Characterization of PCs
An X-ray diffractometer (D8
Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu-Kα radiation was used to analyze
the crystal phases of PCs. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
was recorded with a Nicolet 6700 (Thermo Fisher, USA). The elemental
valence states (C, O, N, and Zn) were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) with an Al K-alpha X-ray source by EscaLab 250Xi
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Raman spectra were obtained using
Labor Raman HR (Horiba, USA). The N2 adsorption isotherms
at −196 °C were measured by using a surface area and porosity
analyzer (ASAP2460, Micromeritics, USA) to evaluate the special surface
area. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of
PCs pretreated at 150 °C for 12 h were achieved. The surface
areas were estimated from the N2 adsorption isotherms using
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation in the relative
pressure range of 0.05–0.20. The pore volume and pore size
distribution were determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) model and t-plot method, respectively. The structure and morphology
of the samples were observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
(SU8010, Hitachi, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
(JEM-2010, Tokyo, Japan). The zeta potential of adsorbent was measured
at various pH values using a zeta potential and nanometer particle
size analyzer (Nano ZS90, Mastersizer, UK). The amount of acidic functional
groups (AFG) of materials was determined by Boehm titration.72

Adsorption Experiments
DCF was dissolved
in water directly
to prepare 100 mg/L stock solutions. Solutions of DCF with the chosen
concentrations of 10–100 mg/L for adsorption experiments were
prepared by successive dilution of the prepared stock solution. For
the adsorption experiment, 5 mg of adsorbent was put into 50 mL of
solution and the resulting mixture was incubated at 25 °C for
a certain period under shaking. Afterward, the solutions were collected
by filtration with a syringe filter (polytetrafluoroethylene, hydrophobic,
0.45 μm). The concentration of the residual target contaminant
was evaluated by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Shimadzu,
UV-1800, Japan) at 276 nm. The average values considered as the standard
were acquired from three consecutive experimental results. Different
kinetic models (pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic
models) and adsorption isotherm models (Langmuir and Freundlich models)
were utilized to analyze the adsorption results. The detail methods/equations
for the calculation of adsorption results are explained in the Supporting
Information. The effect of the solution’s initial pH on the
adsorbed amount over PC-1000 was ascertained by adjusting the pH values
with HCl or NaOH solution (0.1 mol/L). The reusability of PC-1000
for DCF capture was verified by ultrasonically washing several times
with 0.1 mol/L NaOH in methanol, and subsequent drying was conducted
by vacuum drying at 60 °C overnight. Total organic carbon (TOC)
in the collected water samples before and after adsorption was determined
by using a TOC analyzer (TOC-L CPN, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).

Boehm
Titration Experiments
PC (0.50 g) for analysis
was added to each of the three separate beakers containing 50 mL of
0.10 mol/L NaOH,·Na2CO3, or NaHCO3, respectively, and the mixture was magnetically stirred at room
temperature for 24 h. Finally, the liquid fraction was collected by
filtration, and the amount of the acidic functional group was calculated
by titrating the filtered solution with 0.10 mol/L standard aqueous
solution of HCl. Methyl red was used as an indicator for all titrations.
