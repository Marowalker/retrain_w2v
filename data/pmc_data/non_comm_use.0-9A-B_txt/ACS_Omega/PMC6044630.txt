Peptides from skin
secretions of amphibians are considered important
components of their immune system and also play a relevant role in
their defense mechanism against predators. Herein, by using mass spectrometry
(MS), we characterize the sequence of 13 peptides from the gland secretion
of the hylid tree frog, Boana punctata. Using in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging
MS of a transverse section of the skin tissue, we show that some peptides
are stored as longer molecules that are cleaved after being secreted,
whereas others do not undergo any modification. Sequence comparison
with peptides from other Boana species
and analysis of the three-dimensional theoretical structure indicate
that this cleavage depends on both the presence of a specific sequence
motif and the secondary structure. The fact that peptides undergo
a rapid cleavage upon secretion suggests that stored and secreted
peptides may have distinct roles for anuran survival, including defense
against pathogens and predators.

1 Introduction
Mass
spectrometry (MS) has become a powerful tool to investigate
the chemistry associated with diverse biological systems.1 This technique allows to detect hundreds to thousands
of ions from a single biological sample and also to detect specific
classes of compounds.2 Thus, MS opens exciting
perspectives to deeply investigate chemical interactions in nature.3 Within different biological contexts, MS-based
protocols allow a more holistic approach of chemical interactions
through proteomics and metabolomics.2,3 In addition,
the improvement of MS-imaging (IMS) reinforces the importance of MS
protocols in assisting different fields of biology to assess some
of the dogmas of biology.3

Peptides
from skin secretions of anuran amphibians (frogs and toads)
have been the subject of numerous studies since the early 90s.4−6 Much of the interests in anuran peptides are related to the high
concentration in which they are secreted, when compared with analogue
substances in mammals,4,5 as well as to their promising
neuroactive and antimicrobial activities.3 During the last decade, identification of the amino acid sequence
of anuran peptides was predominantly conducted through MS techniques,
mainly matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), which
allowed for characterization of a high diversity of structures in
several species from different families.6 These peptides are stored within serous glands (SGs) and are released
on the skin surface under different stress situations.7 A few studies have suggested that at least some primary
peptides are cleaved immediately after secretion.8−10 Whereas the
benefits of this cleavage are not understood,8,10 combined
strategies using different MS techniques may be useful to examine
the occurrence and potential function of cleavage mechanisms in different
species.

Hylidae is one of the largest families of amphibians11 and is considered one of the most important
sources of bioactive peptides.6 Most research
efforts have been focused on the subfamilies, Pelodryadinae and Phyllomedusinae,
whereas information on skin peptides in species of the largest subfamily
Hylinae (706 species) is scarce. Possible explanations to justify
this deficiency include the use of poorly sensitive methodologies
in pioneer studies9 and inadequate bioassays.6 Nevertheless, of the few reports on cleaved peptides
as a result of postsecretory events, most come from studies in the
species of the Hylinae tribe Cophomantini.

Boana
punctata is a common tree
frog species with a wide distribution in South America.12 It is closely associated with emergent aquatic
vegetation in large water bodies.12 This
species has become well-known very recently because it is the first
species of amphibian known to have natural fluorescence.13 In addition, it is the first species of the
tribe Cophomantini for which the structure of peptides from skin secretion
has been described. B. punctata is
a very interesting model to investigate peptides in anurans from morphological,
functional, and evolutionary perspectives because the structure and
ultrastructure of the skin has been well-characterized.14 Moreover, the skin secretion has at least two
peptides, one with antimicrobial activity (hylaseptin P1; HSP1), which
may actually be a cleavage form of a larger peptide,9,15 and a second one, which is likely related to an antipredatory function
(phenylseptin).9,10

Here, we report, on the
basis of MS analyses of skin gland secretions
and direct skin IMS analysis in transverse tissue sections, compelling
evidence for a postsecretory peptide cleavage. Sequence alignment,
including all other peptides reported in Cophomantini, suggests that
the postsecretory peptide cleavage is site-specific and may occur
in other species of the genus Boana. Our results provide valuable information on peptide storage and
secretion from the amphibian’s skin glands and may assist future
research on the function and mechanism of action of these substances.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Peptide Identification
from Skin Gland Secretion
Lyophilized dorsal skin secretions
of males and females of B. punctata were solubilized and analyzed by high-performance
liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS) without
any previous separation step. Fractionation of the crude extract gave
a rich chromatographic profile with more than 22 chromatographic peaks
(Table 1). Tandem MS
analyses (ESI-MS/MS) allowed identification of 20 peptides, along
with the Hyloin fluorophores hyloin G-1 (Hy-G1) and hyloin G-2 (Hy-G2; Table 1).13 The primary structures of 13 peptides were determined by
de novo sequencing through MS/MS analysis of the type b and y + 2 fragment ions from the precursor ions
[M + H]+, [M + 2H]2+, and [M + 3H]3+ observed in the MS spectrum of each peptide. Table 1 also shows a comparison between m/z experimental and m/z theoretical data for precursor ions of each sequenced
peptide. An example of the sequence process is shown in Figure S1
and Table S1 (under the Supporting Information) for peptide P9, whereas detailed analyses of b and y + 2 ions observed for each peptide are depicted
in Table S2. Because of low abundances
of some ions in the MS/MS spectrum, the sequence of the remaining
seven peptides could not been identified. For this reason, we do not
discard that they contain posttranslational modifications or that
they are cyclized.Table 1 Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and Compounds

Four of the 13 identified
peptides have an amidated

The proposed primary structures of the peptides P4, P5, P10, and P11
were confirmed by chemical synthesis. An example of the MS/MS fragmentation
comparison between the natural and synthetic form of the same peptide
is depicted in Figure S2. The uncertainty
owed to the presence of Ile/Leu in the sequence of these peptides
was inferred by comparison of retention times of natural and synthetic
peptides (Table S4).

2.2 Skin Peptides in Cophomantini Tree Frogs
A search in
the APD database revealed a 92 and 78% sequence similarity
between peptides P11 and P10, identified here in B.
punctata, and HSP1, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP)
identified in this same species from a different locality.9 A quick comparison with peptides reported in
other species of the tribe Cophomantini suggested some sequence similarities
(Figure 1). We examined
these similarities by aligning all peptide sequences published in
species of this tribe, which include eight species from the genus Boana that were extracted using surface electrical
stimulation (SES).9,10,15−19 Nevertheless, we have excluded from the analysis 18 peptides identified
in Boana pulchella having a very low
amino acid sequence similarity (data not shown), which were obtained
by solvent extraction.19

of the 13 peptides identified in
the gland secretion from dorsal skin of B. punctata and peptides described in other Cophomantini tree frogs. Arrow indicates
the proteolytic cleavage site reported by de Magalhães and
co-workers.18

Sequence similarity between the peptides described here and
those
found in other Boana tree frogs suggests
putative homologies. For instance, peptide P8 described here shares
85% sequence similarity with peptide P22 described in B. pulchella. Additionally, the difference in one
amino acid between HSP1 and peptide P11 (current work) described for
different populations of B. punctata indicates potential differences at population levels. Although some
authors20,21 have proposed that skin peptides profile
may be used in combination with other information sources, such as
molecular and morphological characters to discriminate hybrids, species,
and clades at higher taxonomic levels, no systematic analysis has
been performed to assess this suggestion. Furthermore, because peptide
profile may vary according to environmental factors,22 a better understanding of the variability and evolution
of these substances represents the necessary previous steps to its
use in systematics.

The peptide alignment (Figure 1) shows a partial overlap of
some of the sequences
reported herein with longer sequences from other Boana species. Because the 13 peptides were observed in all samples examined
in this study, a likely explanation is the existence of a specific
cleavage mechanism. A proteolytic cleavage site was described in Boana raniceps for ranispetins (Figure 1 arrow).18 As reported by these authors, cleaved peptides were most
commonly detected in the gland secretion, whereas full-length raniseptins
were only observed when low temperature and pH conditions were controlled
during the extraction procedures. Although we froze the gland secretion
at −80 °C within 5 min after extraction, a study carried
out with Xenopus laevis(8) considered a few minutes delay to be enough to alter the
relative amounts of intact peptides.

An endopeptidase, specifically
a metalloprotease, identified from
the skin of X. laevis has been described
to be responsible for peptide cleavage in this species.23 According to Giovannini and co-workers,8 this enzyme would be able to recognize a Xaa-Lys
bond (Xaa = Leu, Gly, Ala, or Lys), whereas, according to Resnick
and co-workers,23 the enzyme would hydrolyze
peptides on the basis of a specific secondary structure (see below).
In X. laevis, the enzyme is stored
in SGs and is cosecreted with peptides.23 As it can be observed in Figure 1, raniseptins and cinerascetin show the motif Gly-Lys
between residues 14 and 15, suggesting the existence of a putative
cleavage site. Partial overlap of peptides P4 and P5, which have Lys
in the N-terminal, with the second half of raniseptins and of peptides
P7, P9, P10, and P11, and hylaseptin-P1 (HSP-1), which has Gly in
the C-terminal, with the first half of ranispetins and cinerascetin,
suggests that cleavage of larger intact peptides has occurred in B. punctata. Furthermore, phenylseptin, previously
described for B. punctata, has a Gly-Lys
motif at amino acids 10 and 11, which may also explain the presence
of the shorter peptide P12, with 100% overlap with the former and
a Gly in the C-terminal.

It is also interesting to observe that
peptides that end in Gly
or Ala have their C-terminal in the form of carboxylic acid, whereas
peptides that start with Lys have the C-terminal amidated (P2), suggesting
that the latter corresponds to the C-terminal region of an intact
mature peptide (exception was observed for P4 and P5). Gly-Lys bonds
also occur in position 9–10 in P8 (this work) and P22 (B. pulchella) and in position 10–11 in raniseptins,
CtL-Ha, P7, and P9. The absence of cleavage peptides at this position
may be related to the sequence context next to the potential cleavage
site, which is influenced by the secondary structure of the intact
mature peptides.8,18,24 Gershon24 has found that residues located
proximate to the scissile cleavage site (Lys) can produce an inhibitory
effect toward tryptic attack. For instance, residues such as Asp between
position −3 and +1, Thr between positions −3 and +2,
Ile at positions −2 and −1, and Val at position −1
suppressed the cleavage of Lys-Xaa. These findings may explain the
absence of other peptide fragments in the skin secretion analysis
of B. punctata, despite the occurrence
of different putative cleavage sites. For example, although peptide
P-1976 has two Lys in its sequence at Gly11Lys12 and Leu6Lys7, we only observed the peptides
derived from the former cleavage. The absence of cleavage in the latter
could be explained by the presence of Asp4 at position
−3 of Lys7.

2.3 Spatial
Distribution of Peptides in the Skin
of Frogs
Distribution of skin peptides in B. punctata was examined by MALDI imaging of transverse
sections of dorsal and lateral skin tissues using MS and MS/MS (Figure 2). This sample preparation
and a laser scanning resolution of 20 μm allowed discrimination
of the precise distribution and sequence of peptides within different
gland types occurring in this species. In addition, transverse sections
of the same samples were processed by classical histological methods
and viewed in a light microscope. Light microscopy (LM) examination
along with published detailed structural and ultrastructural analyses
of the skin of this species14 aided in
the interpretation of IMS data.

hematoxylin and eosin. ep, epidermis; de, dermis.

Figure 2A
shows
an adult male of B. punctata and the
skin regions dissected for analysis, whereas Figure 2B shows the global mean MS spectra of the
dorsal and lateral skins, respectively. Analyses of MALDI-MS and MS/MS
IMS data confirmed the presence of at least six peptides corresponding
to ions m/z 1319.8, m/z 1683.3, m/z 1976.2, m/z 2367.5, m/z 2546.7, and m/z 2683.7 in both skin regions and the presence of ion m/z 1088.7 exclusively in the lateral region (Figures 2B and S3). The peptides were found within SGs in both
lateral and dorsal skins and were not detected either in ordinary
mucous glands in the dorsal skin or in specialized mucous glands in
the lateral skin (Figure 2D–G). Because of limitations of the hematoxylin and
eosin staining, which did not allow distinguishing ordinary SGs from
specialized SGs, we were not able to establish the precise location
of peptides on SGs (Figure 2H, right side). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to show the distribution of chemical substances from
the skin of amphibians in transverse sections. One of the main advantages
of this sample preparation is that it allows for examining the differential
distribution of compounds within different gland types.

Direct
MS/MS analysis of the skin transverse section enabled determination
of the sequence of peptides corresponding to ions m/z 1683.3, m/z 1976.2, and m/z 2367.5 (Figure S3; Table S3), whereas the sequences of
remaining ions could only be partially determined. Sequence comparisons
with peptides found in the skin gland secretion indicate that ion m/z 1683.3 corresponds to peptide P13,
whereas ions m/z 1976.2 and m/z 2367.5 correspond to full-length peptides
that were cleaved after the glands secreted their content. Specifically,
peptide P12 found in the gland secretion would be the result of cleavage
of ion m/z 1976.2 between Gly11 and Lys12, (Figure 3), and peptide P11 would be that of cleavage
of ion m/z 2367.5 between Gly14 and Lys15. It is worth noticing that phenylseptin,
which was identified in the skin gland secretion from specimens in
another population of B. punctata,10 is identical to ion m/z 1976.2, and that the first 16 N-terminal amino acids are
identical in both, ion m/z 2367.5
and cinerascetin, found in Boana cinerascens.15

or identical peptides identified in the gland secretion of B. punctata [B. punctata_P11, B. punctata_P12, and B. punctata_P13 (this article); B.

situ MALDI IMS and peptides identified in the gland secretion.

2.4 Three-dimensional
(3D) Theoretical Structure
Analysis and Activity Projection
3D theoretical structure
analysis of the identified peptides in B. punctata shows that they all exhibit similar characteristics to those present
in active AMPs. The mechanism of action of AMPs is primarily based
on the perturbation of the target cell wall membrane.25 The vast variability of primary structures of antimicrobial
sequences found in diverse amphibian species shows that selectivity
for different membrane lipid compositions is not due to the linear
sequence but due to the 3D structure and the distribution of their
residues. Most AMPs are cationic molecules with an amphipathic distribution
of the residues that allow them first to approach the membrane through
electrostatic interactions and subsequently disrupt the cell wall
membrane through hydrophobic interactions.

Twelve of the thirteen
peptides identified here in B. punctata present a theoretical 3D structure with an α-helix motif (Figure 4). Schiffer and Edmundson
wheel projection diagrams show an amphipathic distribution of the
amino acid residues (Figure 4),26 where 9 identified peptides
were cationic, with +1 (P2, P6, P9, P10, P11) or +2 (P4, P5, P7, P8)
net charges, and 12 peptides have at least 5 hydrophobic residues
on the same surface, granting a well-defined hydrophobic side. These
characteristics suggest that the peptides could interact with membranes,
both in an electrostatically and a hydrophobically way, with the prospect
to be AMPs.

Combinatorial techniques and, specifically, the
development of
soluble synthetic combinatorial libraries with the use of positional
scanning deconvolution process, show that there are most important
amino acid(s) or building block(s) for every position and many acceptable
conservative substitutions that do not alter the activity potency
(e.g., valine for isoleucine and serine for threonine).27 This observation suggests that P11 will have
the same 3D structure and antimicrobial activity described for HSP-1.
These peptides differ in only one conservative substitution (Ile2 for Val2). Several techniques such as circular
dichroism and antimicrobial assays were employed with B. punctata peptides, demonstrating that HSP-1 adopts
an α-helical structure in the presence of a membrane-mimetic
ambient and weak antimicrobial activity with no significant lytic
effect toward red or white blood cells.9 This was also observed in homologous sequences described for AMPs
in other anuran species.28 The weak activity
projected for P11 is also supported by the minimum inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) determined for cinerascetins that this peptide presents MICs
in the order of 16 and 10 μM for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively.

Activity of P4 and P5 peptides could be projected taking into account
that evaluated for the Rsp-1 and its both halves, Rsp-1 (1–14)
and Rsp-1 (15–29). It has been described that mature raniseptins
peptides identified in B. raniceps are
subjected to specific cleavage that gives rise to two halve fragments.
It was further observed that the C-terminal fragments presented antimicrobial
activity at least 30-folds lower than the precursor.

The same
analysis could be done with phenylseptin and peptide P12,
the latter being identical to the N-terminal region of the former.
However, phenylseptin was pondered as possibly responsible for sensorial
aversive properties for predators. Therefore, it is plausible that
a similar aversive activity could also be performed by P12 as part
of a general warning strategy against natural predators of B. punctata. In the case of the remaining peptides
that presented original sequences, additional work should be carried
out to evaluate the biological function.

Peptide secondary structure
determines the accessibility of certain
residues to proteases.8,23 Analysis of the 3D theoretical
structure shows two α-helix motifs for raniseptins and Ctx (Ile21)-Ha mature peptides, where Gly14Lys15 in raniseptin and Gly10Lys11 in Ctx(Ile21)-Ha are placed in between the α-helix motifs. Considering
that in B. punctata the same process
might occur for mature peptides, we theoretically modeled the peptide
sequences corresponding to assembly of P7 or P12 as the N-terminal
half and of P4 or P2 as the C-terminal one, as if they were joined
in a mature peptide, taking into account the possible existence of
a Gly-Lys cleavage site (Figure S4). Two
α-helix bound by a coil with the Gly-Lys motif was found in
all tested combinations.

2.5 Potential
Roles for a Postsecretory Cleavage
Mechanism of Amphibian Peptides
Considering the results discussed
in sections 2.2 and 2.3, it seems that peptide cleavage depends on various
factors, such as the sequence and secondary structure. In the cases
in which peptides meet specific conditions, cleavage may be a rapid
phenomenon that occurs under a natural state. For instance, the same
peptides may be detected in situ and in gland secretions (i.e., peptide
P13), whereas in other circumstances, full-length peptides are only
found within the gland (i.e., ions m/z 1976.2 and 2367.3) or in the gland secretion when using particular
conditions, such as low temperature.18 Therefore,
it seems likely that a rapid enzymatic cleavage mechanism occurs shortly
after peptides are secreted. Furthermore, the fact that this mechanism
occurs in distantly related groups, such as hylids tree frogs of the
genus Boana and pipids of the genus Xenopus, suggests that peptide cleavage should be
relatively common in anurans.

Different hypotheses have been
proposed to explain the rapid cleavage of secreted peptides in amphibians.
Some suggested that it may function as an “inactivation mechanism,”
because prolonged exposure to AMPs present in the secretion would
be expected to induce toxicity to the host organism itself.8,29 If this is the case, SGs in the skin that store full-length peptides
should have a protective system against the toxic peptides. Alternatively,
peptides with antibiotic activity may be activated by proteolysis.8 Still, evidences in Cophomantini are contradictory:
hylaseptin, which is a cleaved peptide, exhibits antimicrobial activity,9 whereas cleaved raniseptins exhibit much lower
or null antimicrobial activity when compared to intact raniseptin.
Because the gland content is secreted under stress conditions mostly
associated with predation,7 a rapid endoproteolysis
may constitute a line of defense against predators.18 In fact, it has been shown that protein degradation can
generate peptides with diverse biological functions and degrees of
bitterness.30 In this context, we observed
that a cleaved form of phenylseptin would be a way to increase the
bitterness of this molecule because apparently, the bitter scale of
peptides is related with short peptides that share a Phe-Phe motif.
Finally, published evidence indicate that amphibian skin peptides
have at least two important functions, a host-shielding antimicrobial
activity and a toxic effect against predators.31 Our results, alongside previous research, suggest that
a simple and rapid enzymatic cleavage may account for these two important
ecological functions for anuran survival.

3 Conclusions
Resistance to conventional antibiotics by certain pathogenic microorganisms
is an increasingly serious problem and many infections are no longer
easily cured, leading to expensive and prolonged treatment as well
as a higher risk of death (press release, World Health Organization,
World Health Day 2011).32 AMPs from amphibians
gland secretions were demonstrated to have notable activity against
a wide variety of pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Moreover, Raaymakers and co-workers have recently shown that AMPs
also act as a toxin delivery system against predators.31 Although many species of amphibians have already
been studied worldwide, our knowledge of the diversity, evolution,
and biological functions of peptides in this group of vertebrates
is limited. Still, much of the null effects reported several years
ago for a defensive role of related compounds could be associated
with the use of inadequate bioassays and less sensible methodologies.
Our findings call for a reinterpretation and reanalysis of the roles
of skin peptides in these species of amphibians. The cleavage mechanism
proposed herein, taken together with evidences in distantly related
species, suggest that this mechanism may be widespread in amphibians.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Amphibian Skin Secretions
Female
and male specimens of the tree frog B. punctata were collected at night in the outskirts of the city of Santa Fe,
Santa Fe, Argentina, and next to Forte Coimbra, Mato Grosso do Sul,
Brazil. Frog secretion was obtained by mild electric stimulation of
the dorsal skin region (3–6 V, 1–2 min), collected in
distilled water, frozen within the first 5 min after collection, and
lyophilized.

Collection permits were issued by Secretaria de
Medio Ambiente, Ministerio de Aguas, Servicios Públicos y Medio
Ambiente, Province of Santa Fe, Argentina (021-2011 and 063-2013)
and Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade
SISBIO (Permit 50071-1). All procedures involving animals were carried
out according to the regulations specified by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales,
Universidad de Buenos Aires (Res C/D 140/00) and those specified by
Conselho Nacional de Controle de Experimentação Animal,
Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação,
Brazil. Authorization access in SISGEN (Sistema Nacional de Gestão
do Patrimônio Genético e do Conhecimento Tradicional
Associado). Voucher specimens of B. punctata are housed at the herpetological collection of the Museo Argentino
de Ciencias Naturales “Bernardino Rivadavia”, Buenos
Aires, Argentina (MACN 40110-17, 43337-48) and Coleção
Celio F.B. Haddad, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, São
Paulo, Brazil (CFBH 40991-94).

4.2 Peptide
Separation and Sequencing
Liquid chromatography (LC)-diode
array detector (DAD)-time-of-flight
(TOF) high-resolution MS analyses were performed using an Agilent
1200 series LC with a DAD coupled with a QqTOF Mass Spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonics, Billerica—USA). Skin secretion was dissolved in
ultrapure cold water, filtered, and injected into a C18-Luna column
(Phenomonex—100 mm × 2.0 mm × 3 μm) with temperature
adjusted to 30 °C. The mobile phase (flow 0.3 mL min–1) consisted of water/formic acid 0.1% (v/v) (A) and methanol (B)
in the following gradient: 0.0–25.0 min (10–75% B) and
25.0–35.0 min (75–100% B). Q-TOF acquisition parameters
were as follows: capillary 3.5 kV, end plate offset 500 V, and capillary
temperature at 200 °C; N2 was used as the dry gas
at 6.0 L min–1 and nebulizer pressure was 3 bar;
drying gas temperature was 200 °C; positive ESI mode. All peaks
were automatically selected for fragmentation during the LC-ESI-MS/MS
experiments. Fragmentation was performed by collision-induced dissociation
using ultrahigh pure argon as the collision gas, with a collision
energy of 35 eV for each precursor ion. The collision cell quadrupole
was set to an energy of 7.0 eV, the cell radiofrequency was set at
800 Vpp, and the gas flow rate at 30%. Accurate masses
were obtained by multipoint mass calibration using sodium formate
as the internal standard. Further details of MS/MS conditions used
in LC-ESI-MS/MS experiments are depicted in Table S5.

The molecular mass determination of compounds presented
in the gland secretion was performed by selecting the ions [M + H]+, [M + H]2+, and/or [M + 3H]3+. De novo
peptide sequencing was performed through manual interpretation of
tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) of fragments b and y + 2 of ions [M + H]+ and [M + 2H]2+. Data acquisition and interpretation were performed using the software
Bruker Compass Data Analysis v. 4.0. Fragment analysis was carried
out following the Biemann nomenclature.33 The MS/MS spectra were uploaded to Global Natural Products Social
Molecular Networking (GNPS).34

The
amino acid sequence similarity search was carried out using
NCBI nonredundant database through the PSI-BLAST algorithm.35 The program Compute pI/Mw Tool was used for
theoretical pI and molecular mass calculation. ClustalW tool was used
to calculate the identity and similarity scores among the peptides.36

4.3 Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis
Peptides
were manually synthesized by the solid-phase approach using Fmoc/t-butyl chemistry.37 Peptide
elongation was carried out in polypropylene syringes fitted with a
polyethylene porous disk. Solvents and soluble reagents were removed
by suction. A Wang Resin and Rink amide MBHA Resin (Peptides International)
were used for C-terminal carboxylated and amidated peptide synthesis
respectively. Samples were treated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/triisopropylsilane/water
(95:2.5:2.5) for removal of the protecting group and cleavage. Identity
of the peptide was confirmed by electrospray MS on a MicroTOF Q II
(Bruker Daltonics).

4.4 Sequence Comparison within
Cophomantini Tree
Frogs
The search for similar sequences was performed employing
an online database of AMPs.38 Because of
the Leu/Ile uncertainty in some of the determined sequences, the search
for sequences similar to those of B. punctata was done using two extreme approaches, assigning all uncertainties
(X) to Leu or to Ile. The similarity in the sequences of peptides
identified in this work were compared, employing the alignment of
multiple sequences, on the online server MAFFT.39 This alignment included sequences described in B. punctata(9,10) and in all species
of the tribe Cophomantini, subfamily Hylinae. The specific sequences
included were the following: eight peptides of B. raniceps (raniseptins),18 peptides of Boana albopunctata (hylin-1a and Ctx-Ha),16 peptides of Boana lundii (hylin-b1 and hylin-b2),17 one peptide
of Boana semilineata (Hs-1),40 and one peptide of B. cinerascens (Cinerascetin-01).15 For comparison,
uncertainties (X) in the peptide sequence identified in our study
in B. punctata were either left as
Leu or were tentatively assigned to Leu or to Ile based on similarities
with the amino acid sequence identified in the same or related species
and also on comparisons with synthetic analogues (Table S4).

4.5 Sample Preparation for
MALDI IMS
The frog skin sections preparation for the MALDI
imaging studies
was the challenging part of this work. The skins were very thin and
fragile, making it almost impossible to obtain transverse sections
without suitable embedding. We tried several embedding materials,
among which we found that 2% carboxymethyl cellulose worked the best
while eliminating several problems in ionization.

The frog skins
were removed, immediately embedded, and frozen. Samples were sectioned
in slices of 10 μm width in a cryotome (CM1860 Cryostat, Leica
Biosystem, Nussloch, Germany) at −20 °C. Sections were
mounted on a indium tin oxide-coated glass slide for MALDI imaging
(Bruker Daltonic, Bremen, Germany), followed by matrix coating in
Imageprep (Bruker Daltonic, Bremen, Germany). Sixty cycles from the
solution of 7 mg mL–1 of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic
acid matrix in 50% acetonitrile/H2O with 0.2% TFA was applied.
Each cycle was based on spraying, filling chamber with nitrogen, and
drying. After that, the tissue sample was subjected to analysis by
MALDI imaging.

4.6 MALDI IMS
Analyses
were performed
using a MALDI-TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics, UltrafleXtreme, Bremen, Germany)
system equipped with a smartbeam-II laser system controlled by a FleXcontrol
v.3.3 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), employing AutoXecute mode.
IMS data were analyzed and normalized using FlexImaging v.2.1 (Bruker
Daltonics). The settings of the instrument were as follows: positive
ion reflector mode; ion source 1, 25.00 kV; ion source 2, 22.40 kV;
lens, 8.30 kV; pulsed ion extraction, 120 ns; laser frequency, 100
Hz; and matrix suppression mass cutoff, m/z 600. The spectra were recorded across a mass range of m/z 700–4000 and accumulate 500
shots per spectrum. The images were collected from a transverse section
of frog skin at 20 μm spatial resolution in both x and y directions using MS positive-ion mode. A
peptide calibration standard II (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany)
was used as the external calibration of the mass spectrometer. The
average mass deviation was below 10 ppm. MS/MS analysis directly from
frog skin was performed to confirm assignments and identify the major
peptides in the positive-ion reflector mode. The ions selected were
accelerated to 19 kV in the LIFT cell for MS/MS analysis, where the
settings of the instrument were as follows: pulsed ion extraction,
110 ns, laser frequency, 100 Hz, and 500 shots. De novo peptide sequencing
was performed through manual interpretation of tandem mass spectra
(MS/MS) of fragments b and y + 2
of [M + H]+ ions. Data acquisition and interpretation were
performed using the software, Bruker Flex Analysis v. Fragment analysis
was carried out following Biemann nomenclature.33 The MS/MS spectra were uploaded to PeptideAtlas.41 Accession number: PASS0118.

4.7 Light Microscopy Images
For LM images,
10 μm sections of dorsal and lateral skin samples were cut before
and after the sections were used for MALDI IMS. These sections were
mounted onto microscope slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin,
mounted with glycerol, covered with quartz coverslips, and observed
using LM. These images were compared with those detailed by Brunetti
and co-workers.14
