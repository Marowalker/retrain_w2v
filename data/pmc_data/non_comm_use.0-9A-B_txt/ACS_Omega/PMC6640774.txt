In
many biomedical applications, broad full-color emission is important,
especially for wavelengths below 450 nm, which are difficult to cover
via supercontinuum generation. Single-crystalline-core sapphires with
defect-driven emissions have potential roles in the development of
next-generation broadband light sources because their defect centers
demonstrate multiple emission bands with tailored ligand fields. However,
the inability to realize high quantum yields with high crystallinity
by conventional methods hinders the applicability of ultra-broadband
emissions. Here, we present how an effective one-step fiber-drawing
process, followed by a simple and controllable thermal treatment,
enables a low-loss, full-color, and crystal fiber-based generation
with substantial color variability. The broad spectrum extends from
330 nm, which is over 50 nm further into the UV region than that in
previously reported results. The predicted submicrometer spatial resolutions
demonstrate that the defect–ligand fields are potentially beneficial
for achieving in vivo cellular tomography. It is also noteworthy that the
efficiency of the milliwatt-level full-color generation, with an optical-to-optical
efficiency of nearly 5%, is the highest among that of the existing
active waveguide schemes. In addition, direct evidence from high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy together with electron energy loss
spectroscopy and crystal-field ligands reveals an excellent crystalline
core, atomically defined core/cladding interfacial roughness, and
significant enhancements in new laser-induced electronic defect levels.
Our work suggests an inexpensive, facile, and highly scalable route
toward achieving cellular-resolution tomographic imaging and represents
an important step in the development of endoscope-compatible diagnostic
devices.

1 Introduction
The increasing utility of biophotonics has stimulated the development
of clinical optical coherence tomography (OCT) to achieve cellular
spatial resolution and, eventually, three-dimensional tissue imaging
in vivo.1−3 This development of a noninvasive label-free technique
has resulted in increased demand for endoscope-compatible broadband
light sources (BLSs) with efficient luminescence. This urgent work
has included exploration of available broad emissions, especially
in the full-color (UV to red) region because the axial resolution
of OCT is primarily governed by a bandwidth of 3 dB and is inversely
governed by the square of the center wavelength of the light source.

Over the past decade, several alternatives have been developed
to fabricate bulk-type BLSs, including crystalline (or amorphous)-assisted
multiple emission ions,4−6 photonic crystal fiber generated supercontinuums,7−9 and high-power superluminescent diodes (SLDs).10−12 However, each
of these approaches presents one or more drawback. For example, the
design of multiple active ions in a crystalline host is highly challenging
because of the deteriorated crystal quality and, consequently, weak
luminescence, which is insufficient to meet practical requirements.13 In addition, amorphous matrices suffer from
poor chemical durability and require stringent processing to suppress
cluster formation and crystallization.14 Second, for emissions below 450 nm, obtaining the aforementioned
supercontinuum is difficult because of the large detuning resulting
from pulse laser excitation. Additionally, expensive and extremely
sophisticated ultrafast lasers become unfavorable when integrating
with compact scanning apparatuses, limiting their size and simplicity
as well as increasing their cost.

Despite the success of high-quality
InGaN growth, white SLDs with
a blue InGaN chip combined with a yellow phosphor blended with organic
resins have attracted intensive research interest because of their
unique properties and potential applications.15 However, this configuration presents a poor Commission Internationale
de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinate because a red
light component, typically above 600 nm, is lacking.16 Moreover, the high working temperature of high-power SLDs
would cause severe carbonization at the phosphor/resin interface,
resulting in the degradation of illumination and inducing color shifting.17

Unlike
the above bulk-type examples, the compact, low-cost, and highly heat
dissipating fiber-based BLSs are highly suitable for long-range biomedical
endoscopic applications and high-capacity telecommunications.18 These materials feature directional high luminescence
and better light collimation, leading to higher coupling efficiencies
of light into optical fibers where no traditional light source is
attainable. Thus, finding suitable materials with fiber-waveguide
and BLS functionalities remains challenging because simple band-to-band
emission in a single material host is difficult. To this end, a facile
route for achieving fiber-based BLSs covering the full-color range
(UV to red) for applications in an OCT system is highly desirable.

Herein, we demonstrated defect-driven full-color broadband emission
by engineering a glass-clad sapphire crystalline-core fiber using
the laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) technique to create new defect
levels within the bandgap and conduction band.19−21 Glass-clad
sapphire fibers with and without thermal treatment presented tunable
full-color emission when pumped with 325 nm excitation. Unlike heavy
particle irradiation22−26 and thermochemical reaction,27−29 which are often accompanied by
poor crystallinity and insufficient formation of F- and F2-type color centers, leading to a limited bandwidth and low-yield
emission, our proposed facile approach can not only provide a range
extending over 50 nm deeper into the UV region than that previously
achieved and efficient red emission over 600 nm but also can preserve
the material’s high crystallinity. The predicted submicrometer
spatial resolutions demonstrate that the impact of defect–ligand
fields on the relative strength and controlled emitters is potentially
beneficial for full-color emission to achieve in vivo ultrahigh resolution
OCT. Additionally, comparing the measured full-color generation obtained
with defect ligands and examining the high-crystallinity sapphire
core by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed that these
extra bandwidths constitute an effect of considerable oxygen and aluminum
defect centers, which were effectively facilitated by the inclusion
of small amounts of Ti and Cr ions. Equally importantly, we report
for the first time the direct atomic observation of the impacts of
annealing on the crystallinity of a sapphire crystal fiber. Excellent
crystallinity with low propagation loss was observed on a large scale
along the core/cladding interface of the annealed samples, benefiting
from atomic-scale interfacial roughness, far behind the optical wavelength
scale. These results unambiguously demonstrate the applicability of
defect-driven emission as an inexpensive, facile, and highly fluorescent
route.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Impact
of Thermal Treatments on the Nanostructure
Figure 1a shows
the schematics of the procedure by which borosilicate glass-clad sapphire
crystalline-core fibers were grown in a reducing environment that
favors Ti3+ over Ti4+ ions.30Figure 1b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) side-view image of
an LHPG-grown 40 μm diameter sapphire crystalline core with
a uniform diameter and smooth surface along the fiber. A smooth waveguide
surface ensures low-loss propagation because scattering loss stems
from random fluctuations of the core diameter and could become the
dominant attenuation factor.31−33 The bright-field end view of
an as-grown glass-clad sapphire crystalline-core fiber is shown in Figure 1c. It should be noted
that dealing with this type of “heterostructure” material
is an issue in fiber fabrication. The hardness of the crystalline
core and that of the glass cladding are quite different. We have developed
a face preparation process for the hybrid crystalline-core glass-clad
fibers that comprises grinding (using SiC with grain sizes ranging
from 10 to 3 μm) followed by fine polishing (using diamond with
grain sizes ranging from 3 to 0.1 μm). When using this preparation
procedure, the surface processing between the core and cladding can
be controlled, with a depth variation of less than 15 nm. Figure 1d presents the corresponding
compositional distributions of Al and Si. Energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) results indicate that the 40 μm sapphire
core bonds closely to the surrounding borosilicate glass cladding,
ensuring effective optical confinement. In addition, the EDX mappings
clearly delineate hexagon-like core signatures, corresponding to c axis hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures, as illustrated
in Figure 1e.

square region in (c). (e) Crystallographic orientation of the c axis of sapphire.

To directly examine the impact of thermal treatments on the
interfacial
nanostructure and luminescent efficiency, we investigated the nanostructure
at the core/cladding interface. A high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) image (Figure 2) of a representative sample without annealing shows
atomically abrupt interfaces, arranged in a close-packed manner and
in the [21̅1̅0] orientation. The interface plane is nearly
parallel to (011̅0). The lattice image (Figure 2a) from the local area of this sample presents
further dark tweed contrast and planar defects, as indicated by the
two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transform of the [21̅1̅0]
zone axis (inset of Figure 2a), which is streaky along [0002]. The inverse Fourier transform,
shown in Figure 2b,
confirms that abundant nanometer-sized faults occur in the {0002}
planes and propagate in the ⟨011̅0⟩ direction,
as denoted by the red lines. Figure 2c shows a Fourier-filtered image of a thin region within
the sapphire core in which the misfit dislocations are marked by ⊥.
In fact, the rapid heating and cooling that occur during such an LHPG
process could cause considerable residual stress. The employed CO2 laser heating may result in a temperature of over 2000 °C,
as evidenced by the change of the sapphire crystal into a melt, observed
using yttrium–aluminum–garnet (YAG) crystal fibers.34 Thus, defect formation under the influence of
laser heating during LHPG growth, as occurs during pulsed laser ablation,
can result in faults, dislocations, and twins.35,36 Nevertheless, because of the transformed sapphire crystalline core,
which has a defective structure and ionic vacancies, these defect
centers could act as color emitters for broadband generation, as has
been discussed later. Recently, dislocations in the c plane of GaN grown on sapphire were suggested to be significantly
reduced from an initially random dispersed state during high-temperature
annealing.37−39 High-temperature treatments have been shown to be
effective in recovering the corundum-type structural misorientation
introduced during crystal growth, which is relevant in the present
case of III-nitrides.40,41 In addition, surface roughness
has been shown to significantly influence key high-brightness light-emitting
diode (LED) wafering. Although annealing treatment has been correlated
to effective charge transfer (Ti4+ to Ti3+)
in bulk sapphire for efficient laser actions,42,43 the effects of annealing on glass-clad sapphire crystal fibers have
not been studied yet. In this work, the impacts of high-temperature
treatment were investigated to understand how the nanostructure of
the core/cladding interface is influenced by annealing and to elucidate
the process of defect reduction with respect to the fluorescent properties
for potential OCT applications.

interface showing a γ-Al2O3 nanocrystallite

(d). (f) Inverse Fourier transforms of (e) showing the orientation
relationship (01̅1̅)γ∥(202̅1̅)α and (1̅01̅)γ∥(011̅1̅)α, with misfit dislocations at the γ-Al2O3/α-Al2O3 interface.

In Figure 2d, the
HRTEM observations also indicate that the core/cladding interface
consists primarily of a corundum phase with some nanocrystallites
of spinel-like γ-Al2O3, presumably because
of glass cladding-induced interdiffusion. The γ-to-α transformation
involves a change in the face-centered cubic (FCC)–HCP oxygen
framework and is commonly thermally activated in alumina at temperatures
above 500 °C.44−46 In our case, however, the transformation of the α-form
to the metastable γ-Al2O3 occurs via a
different mechanism, that is, sapphire/silica interdiffusion. Therefore,
glass cladding by laser irradiation in the LHPG system would introduce
nonstoichiometric numbers of Al, Si, and O atoms. More Si and O atoms
will be displaced than Al atoms because of the weak bonding of SiO2. Further, the displacement energies of Si and O atoms in
silica are estimated to be 20 and 10 eV, respectively, assuming an
Si–O bond energy of ∼5 eV.47 In contrast, the displacement energies of Al and O atoms in sapphire
are 20 and 65 eV,48 respectively. As a
result, during irradiation, α-to-γ transformation occurs
via inward diffusion of excess Si and O atoms from the borosilicate
glass cladding. In fact, all of the Al3+ in α-Al2O3 are in octahedral sites, whereas γ-Al2O3 contains a random distribution of Al3+ and vacancies in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the spinel
structure. In contrast, a small amount of Si signal, detected by point-count
EDX, was collected at a depth of 10 nm across the interface by HRTEM;
this signal is considered to be nearly inevitable when fabricating
such glass-clad/crystalline-core fiber waveguides. According to the
HRTEM observations, γ-Al2O3 does not form
distinguishable clusters but rather appears to exhibit oriented attachment
to the sapphire core, as shown in Figure 2d. The electron-diffraction pattern and magnified
lattice fringe in the inset of Figure 2d allow the measurement of interplanar spacings of
0.251 nm for (202)γ, 0.219 nm for (02̅2̅)γ, 0.342 nm for (011̅1̅)α, and 0.218 nm for (202̅1̅)α. (Note:
γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3 [i.e., sapphire] are denoted by γ and α, respectively;
the diffractions of γ and α are circled in cyan and red,
respectively.) Figure 2e shows the identified nanocrystallites with close attachment to
γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3 (denoted as γ and α, respectively), following
a crystallographic relationship (01̅1̅)γ∥(202̅1̅)α and (1̅01̅)γ∥(011̅1̅)α, which
were also identified by the high-resolution lattice image and 2D and
inverse Fourier transforms in the [1̅11]γ∥[011̅2]α zone axis. Data from the local regions of the γ-Al2O3 nanocrystallites processed in Figure 2f indicate the existence of
numerous misfit dislocations (marked by ⊥), with the half-plane
parallel to the (1̅01̅)γ edge-on along
the γ-Al2O3/α-Al2O3 interface. The interfacial misfit dislocations occur periodically
and are evenly spaced in nearly all 2(011̅1̅)α planes. Although spinel-like structures are present at the core/cladding
interface, their abundance is negligible because the size of these
nanocrystallites is far behind the wavelength of light when the signal
passes through the crystalline core of the fiber. Specifically, the
scattering loss of nanocrystallites shows an a6 dependence (where a is the radius of the
nanocrystallite).49

Figure 3a,b shows
the micrographs and corresponding 2D Fourier-filtered images of the
processed sample after annealing recorded along the sapphire [011̅1]
zone axis, respectively. The interfacial selected-area electron-diffraction
(SAED) pattern is also shown in the inset of Figure 3a, which reveals a high crystallinity and
the absence of planar defects. Significantly, excellent large-scale
crystalline quality of the sapphire core was achieved along the interface
between the annealed samples, suggesting that half-plane dislocation
and planar defects disappeared. The defect-free sapphire crystalline
core was obtained from prolonged thermal treatment at 1650 °C
for 3 h. Careful examination of around 30 TEM images showed that the
defect densities of the fibers with and without annealing are estimated
to be ∼10–6 #/nm2 and ∼10–2 #/nm2, respectively. On the basis of these
data (Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting
Information (SI)), we can conclude that the effectiveness of high-temperature
annealing is related to the reduction of the interfacial root-mean-square
roughness (0.5350 vs 0.1933 nm) and correlation length (2.4938 vs
1.0660 nm). Both small interfacial roughness and correlation length
favor achieving very low propagation losses within the glass-clad/crystalline-core
fibers. This is because the interplay of light with roughness increases
as the interfacial variation increases, and scattering increases when
the correlation length is comparable to the wavelength. In addition,
scattering loss α can be deduced on the basis of a theoretical
model in terms of interfacial roughness σ and correlation length Lc, developed by Payne and Lacey50 1  where k0, d, and n1 are
the free-space
wave vector, core radius, and core index, respectively. Function g is primarily determined by the waveguide geometry, whereas f is determined by σ and Lc. The extracted scattering losses for our sapphire crystalline-core
fiber with interfacial roughness values of 0.5350 (nonannealed) and
0.1933 nm (annealed) are calculated to be 1.236 and 0.069 dB/cm, respectively.
This nearly atomically smooth core/cladding interface represents an
order of magnitude improvement in roughness and hence a low propagation
loss compared to that in the traditional ultrafast-laser-inscribed
waveguide, which exhibits typical values from 1 dB/cm to a few dB/cm.31 These results highlight the clear superiority
of our LHPG-based fiber-drawing technique over other techniques, such
as ultrafast-laser inscription. It is also noteworthy that unlike
that in most ceramic-prepared sapphire fibers that are polycrystalline
and rather void after annealing, and51−53 in some cases contain
intragranular amorphous phases at grain boundaries if incomplete crystallization
occurs, we find no evidence of an amorphous inclusion nor any impurity
precipitation within the core region. By contrast, a single-crystalline-core
fiber exhibits a relatively small scattering loss because of the lack
of grain boundaries and pores that reduce optical quality.

core and borosilicate glass cladding after annealing, which shows

interface viewed edge-on in the [011̅1] zone axis. (b) The corresponding
Fourier-filtered image confirms the effectiveness of the dislocation
reduction during annealing and hence (c) sapphire cores with high
crystallinity are obtained.

2.2 Ligand-Driven Full-Color Evolution
The impact of annealing treatments on the full-color evolution from
the starting material to the as-grown glass-clad sapphire core fibers
is shown in Figure 4a. Strong, sharp peaks superimposed on the broadband emission are
distinctly observed near the excitation wavelength. These peaks can
be assigned to the spontaneous Raman scattering modes of the sapphire
crystalline core, suggesting the effectiveness of waveguide confinement
with high crystallinity and low propagation loss. Both the fluorescent
and Raman spectra were probed by a 325 nm laser in the center of the
core region at room temperature. Figure 4a shows the spectra of step 2, denoted by
pink (nonannealed) and blue (annealed) curves, with three broad fluorescent
bands at 330–400, 400–600, and 600–650 nm. These
differ significantly from those of the starting material (the orange
curve in Figure 4a)
and the as-grown 40 μm sapphire core (the cyan curve in Figure 4a), which exhibit
commonly observed green-to-red emissions with weak blue and UV–visible
parts in the sapphire crystals27,54,55 because of insufficient oxygen monovacancies, as discussed in detail
below. The chromaticity coordinates of these four studied samples
are depicted in the 1931 CIE diagram (Figure 4b), indicating that the emission colors from
the starting material to the as-grown glass-clad sapphire crystalline-core
fiber can be tuned from orange to yellow-green by step 1 and then
to white or green by step 2 (annealing). The corresponding CIE coordinates
are (0.413, 0.402), (0.316, 0.424), (0.287, 0.333), and (0.286, 0.406),
respectively. Notably, the color coordinate of the nonannealed sample
(nearly white emission) is located in the vicinity of the pure white
point of (0.333, 0.333), whereas the annealed sample shows intense
green light and could be useful in improving the radiant efficiency
of the typical colored LEDs that lack green emitters.56 The above results clearly demonstrate the versatile applicability
of this method as a facile route and indicate a different physical
color center-formation mechanism during the LHPG-based fiber-drawing
processes.

Figure 4 (a) Representative 325 nm excited full-color generations of the
starting material (orange), LHPG-grown 40 μm sapphire core (cyan),
and glass-clad sapphire crystalline-core fiber with (blue) and without
(pink) annealing, with insets showing the luminescent image from the
fiber end faces. (b) Corresponding color evolutions of (a) during
the growth and thermal treatment of the glass-clad sapphire crystalline-core
fibers. The predicted axial resolutions in air of (c) the nonannealed
and (d) Ar-annealed samples estimated from (a) are approximately 0.97
and 1.03 μm, respectively; the power envelop spectra are shown
by pink curves. This submicrometer spatial resolution demonstrates
enormous potential for achieving in vivo tomographic imaging with
ultrahigh resolution. (e) Full-color emission as a function of excitation,
showing a maximum output power up to milliwatt order. This result
is comparable to that obtained using III–V and III-nitride
light-emitting diodes. (f) Picture of (e) coupled to an SMA optical
fiber and dispersed by a reflective holographic grating.

More importantly, full-color emission with a 3
dB bandwidth covering
the whole UV–visible range has potential as a cellular-resolution
OCT BLS, as shown in Figure 4a. To test this applicability, Figure 4c,d presents simulated interferometric signals
of the nonannealed and Ar-annealed samples estimated from the broadband
spectrum in Figure 4a, respectively. The normalized power envelope, 20 log[H(z)], is calculated via the Hilbert transform, H(z), of the simulated interferometric
signal, as shown by the pink curves in Figure 4c,d. The predicted axial resolutions in air,
estimated from the full-color bandwidth, are approximately 0.97 and
1.03 μm, respectively. The predicted submicrometer-scale axial
resolution of the ligand-driven full-color fiber source in air is
smaller than the corresponding resolutions of OCT images based on
conventional broadband gain media (2.2 μm for Ti3+:sapphire57 and 1.45 μm for Ce3+:YAG58) and white-light sources
(1.6 μm59). The broadband emissions
from representative Ti3+:sapphire and Ce3+:YAG
crystals are among those used as high axial resolution OCT light sources
in the near infrared and visible wavelength ranges, respectively.
A variety of imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), photoacoustic tomography (PT), and confocal and multiphoton
microscopy, have been used for in vivo and ex vivo physiology investigations.60,61 However, these techniques have inherent limitations, such as poor
imaging resolution (MRI and PT) and shallow penetration depth (confocal
and multiphoton microscopy). In this regard, OCT finds a niche among
these techniques. The imaging resolution of OCT is typically limited
to a few micrometers, which is better than that of MRI and PT; however,
its imaging depth is greater than that of confocal and multiphoton
microscopy. The predicted submicrometer-scale axial resolution of
our proposed fiber source is smaller than the corresponding resolution
of OCT based on conventional broadband gain media. This ability has
been recognized to be important for understanding the dynamic interactions
of cellular behaviors at different stages. Probing the response at
a cellular level may provide further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
information. Ideally, it is hoped that the desired OCT configuration,
consisting of a full-color fiber source with a fast scanning rate,
can offer a truly viable architecture for high-resolution tomography.
Investigations are currently underway toward the realization of this
ultimate goal. Overall, these submicrometer spatial resolutions demonstrate
that the impact of defect–ligand fields on the relative strength
and controlled emitters is potentially beneficial for full-color emission
to achieve in vivo ultrahigh resolution OCT.

Figure 4e shows
the measured and fitted output powers as a function of the 325 nm
incident pump power. Figure 4f shows the corresponding picture of the generated full-color
emission coupled to a commercial SMA fiber and dispersed by a reflective
holographic grating. The maximum output power of the full-color emission
was limited by the available pump power. It is noteworthy that as
much as ∼1.2 mW (white light) and ∼1.6 mW (green light)
of the output power were achieved, corresponding to optical-to-optical
efficiencies of 4.7 and 6.6%, respectively. To our knowledge, these
high conversion efficiencies are the highest among conventional glass
fibers.62−64 The high optical-to-optical conversion efficiency
can be ascribed to the large emission cross-sections of the color
centers produced by the odd-parity phonon vibrations.65 The emission cross-sections of the F- and F2-type color emitters in the sapphire crystal are 1–2 orders
of magnitude higher than those found in typical transition-metal-doped
sapphire66−69 and YAG21,34,70 wideband gain
media (10–23 m2 vs 10–21–10–22 m2). The resulting high
conversion efficiency
is also the highest reported to date among the existing waveguide-type
white light-production techniques, including that obtained using supercontinuum
lasers. It is also noteworthy that an increase in the fiber length
generally leads to higher losses, as introduced by absorption and
propagation losses. However, a longer fiber length is necessary in
practice to extract the maximum output power from the sapphire crystalline
core, because the gain saturation increases with increasing emission
cross-sections for the F- and F2-type color emitters. The
nature of these larger emission cross-sections of the color emitters
in the sapphire crystalline core ensures a higher output power. Moreover,
on the basis of the calculated numerical aperture of 0.89 and solid
angle of 2.89 in a 40 μm diameter sapphire core fiber, one can
evaluate luminous fluxes of ∼0.8 lm (white light) and ∼1.1
lm (green light) from the milliwatt-order full-color generations.
These results lead to a luminance of ∼108 cd/m2 and are comparable to those obtained using III–V and
III-nitride light-emitting diodes.71,72

Conventional
X-ray diffraction (XRD) can give direct information
about the crystalline quality and size as well as the presence of
defects in the crystal. This is especially true for the large single
crystals or polycrystalline materials in bulk forms. Although XRD
is a promising technique for the characterization of the overall degree
of crystallinity of bulk samples, it is rather difficult to measure
the fiber quality precisely between the core and the cladding with
micrometer-scale spatial resolution when using this method. This is
because XRD is limited by the beam diameter of the X-ray source, which
is typically in the range of a few to a few tens of millimeters. The
spatial resolution of XRD is often poor and is further exacerbated
when directly examining a micrometer-sized crystal fiber core and
cladding. Several previous reports have addressed stress field and
crystal quality determination, with submicrometer spatial resolution,73−77 in bulk samples and waveguide structures, in which it is not possible
to use XRD techniques. The spatially resolved nature of Raman microscopy
allows direct and quantitative analysis of any type of fiber-waveguide
structure. Of course, both Raman spectroscopy and XRD techniques are
complementary on different orders of scale. Additionally, in our specific
cases, direct probing of the micrometer-sized crystal fiber core by
XRD remains challenging because of the presence of the amorphous glass
cladding that surrounds the core. Considering the volume difference ratio (1/63) between the crystalline
core (radius = 20 μm) and the glass cladding (radius = 160 μm),
we expect that the XRD data will have a strong broad background (from
the amorphous glass cladding) and remarkably weak XRD peaks (from
the crystalline core). Unfortunately, the etching approach78 would not be practical either because the stress-dependent
XRD results obtained after removal of the cladding would be different
from those for the original glass-clad case. As an alternative, a
relatively reliable and rapid optical testing technique of confocal
Raman microscopy79−81 has been used to investigate both the fiber quality
and the residual strain with high spatial resolution, as shown in Figure 5a,b.

group theory, showing the typical two A1g and five Eg Raman active modes.77 Another important conclusion from Figure 5a is that the frequency shift
of the second Raman peak presents a strain-dependent behavior, as
shown in an enlarged plot of the Raman spectra from 700 to 800 cm–1 in Figure 5b. By fitting of the Raman spectra shown in Figure 5b, the peak wavenumber of the
annealed fiber was determined to be 754.374 cm–1, with a narrowest 3 dB linewidth of 12.32 cm–1. The extracted linewidths for the nonannealed fiber and the bulk
source rod are 13.11 cm–1 (754.470 cm–1) and 12.74 cm–1 (755.630 cm–1), respectively. This ∼6.0% reduction in the 3 dB Raman linewidth
following subsequent preferential annealing agrees well with the HRTEM
results shown in Figures 2 and 3 and also corroborates the reported
improvement in fiber core quality.

On the other hand, the blueshift
of the second Raman peak in the
as-grown glass-clad forms of sapphire relative to the peaks of the
starting material and the as-grown 40 μm sapphire core shows
that the sapphire matrix experiences considerable strain.77 The presence of this residual strain is attributed
to the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) mismatch between the sapphire
crystalline core and borosilicate glass cladding, which develops when
the temperature changes during the LHPG process and remains within
the crystal fiber as it cools to room temperature. Considering the
average reported value of the strain-induced Raman shift of ∼1.700
cm–1/GPa in bulk sapphire,77 this difference in the Raman shift of ∼−1.256 cm–1 (from 755.630 to 754.374 cm–1)
corresponds to a tensile stress change of ∼−0.74 GPa,
as found for typical luminescent Nd:YVO4, Nd:YAG, and Cr:YAG analogs.34,82,83 In contrast, one can reasonably
estimate the thermally induced residual stress, σ, in the sapphire
core in terms of Young’s modulus ν, Poisson’s
ratio E, core-to-clad volume fraction f, TEC α, and temperature change ΔT using
the following relation84 2  where 3  Assuming that the
physical properties of the
micrometer-sized fiber are similar to those of the millimeter-sized
bulk sample, the values of ν, E, and α
for the c axis sapphire core are 0.23, 400 GPa, and
4.5 × 10–6 °C–1,85,86 respectively. Furthermore, f = (20 μm)2/(160 μm)2 = 1/64, and typically, ΔT = 525–25 °C = 500 K (i.e., the transition
temperature for borosilicate glass is 525 °C). Additionally,
ν, E, and α for the borosilicate cladding
are 0.2, 64 GPa, and 3.8 × 10–6 °C–1,87,88 respectively. On the basis of
this theoretical model, the residual stress was calculated to be ∼−0.80
GPa, which compares favorably with the experimentally determined value
of ∼−0.74 GPa. Thus, the rapid heating and cooling in
this glass cladding process caused significant residual stress between
the crystalline core and the glass cladding, which exhibit considerably
different TECs. Therefore, the thermally induced tensile stress, reaching
values as high as the GPa range, and not the γ-Al2O3-to-sapphire lattice mismatch, induced strain at the
core/clad interface. Additionally, Pezzotti et al. reported the piezospectroscopic
effect of c plane sapphire to account for the observed
strain dependence of F+-type-center emission under application
of biaxial stress.89 This is similar to
the present case of glass-clad c axis sapphire crystalline-core
fiber with TEC mismatch between the crystalline core and glass cladding.
The room-temperature TECs of the sapphire crystalline core and the
borosilicate glass cladding are 4.5 × 10–6 and
3.8 × 10–6 °C–1, respectively.
When compared with the unclad bulk sapphire rod, this TEC mismatch
generates a tensile strain field radially within the core region during
the fiber-drawing process. For an isolated Al3+ ion in
this structure, the local structural arrangement comprises an Al3+ ion surrounded by six oxygen ions in an octahedral site.
This octahedral site may then be distorted by the aforementioned tension
along the C3 symmetry axis, which is analogous
to the case produced under a controlled strain field in ref (89). (Note that there may
be some of planar defects that are not studied in ref (89).) This may illustrate
the origin of the strain-tailored optical properties of hybrid glass-clad/crystalline-core
fiber devices.

2.3 Ligand-Engineered Full-Color
Tuning
As demonstrated in Figure 4, achieving full-color light emission from
a single fiber
with high crystallinity by engineering the electronic structure using
the LHPG technique represents a significant breakthrough. Thus, further
investigating the origin of color center formation using different
fiber growth conditions is important. It should be noted that the
scattering of photons in biological tissue is less pronounced in the
near infrared region than that in the UV region. Short-wavelength
emission in the UVA (320–400 nm) range typically penetrates
tissue to only a few hundred micrometers. However, many biomedical
diagnostic methods for conditions, such as colonic dysplasia and polyps,
use UVA emission to discriminating adenomas from normal tissues in
vitro.90,91 UVA can penetrate the skin more deeply than
UVB (290–320 nm) and is thought to play a key role in skin
aging and wrinkling. It is believed that UVA does not cause major
damage to the epidermis; however, prolonged exposure to UVA radiation
can induce tissue-specific damage and cellular mutagenicity and produce
reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative DNA damage.92,93

Referring to step 2 in Figure 1, the luminescence spectra of the sapphire crystalline-core/glass-clad
fibers both with and without annealing were found to primarily comprise
nine emission bands according to Gaussian deconvolutions, as shown
in Figure 5c,d. These
principal luminescent bands exhibit peaks at approximately 352, 378,
400, 406, 455, 475, 530, 587, and 636 nm and agree well with the known
F- and F2-type centers, Ti3+/Ti4+ ions, Ti4+-facilitated aluminum vacancies (Ti4+–VAl‴), and Cr3+ ions with peaks at 330, 380, 410, 420, 460,
480, 510, 590, and 650 nm,42,94−97 as listed in Table 1. Alternatively, the luminescent band at ∼530 nm can be assigned
to donor emission centers, such as interstitial aluminum ions (AlAl×).98 Note that the center wavelengths are nearly
identical and that the corresponding discrepancies are all within
5%, except for those of the F+ center, which are shifted
by 6.7% from 330 to 352 nm because of the longer excitation wavelength
(260 vs 325 nm). This red-shifted Stokes shift shows that the typical
F-type center emission originates from a trapped
charge coupled to lattice vibrations by analogy to the phonon-assisted
alkali halides.99

To date, abundant reports on the formation of defect
emitters in
sapphire crystals have been published because of their impressive
electronic transitions and thus a variety of luminescent properties
over the entire full-color spectral range have been developed. However,
to the best of our knowledge, no direct observations of the effects
of the interplay between color center evolution and thermal treatments
have been reported, especially in the fiber form. As summarized in Table 1, the first salient
feature is that the gain–bandwidth product (σ)(Δν)
(i.e., the area of the Gaussian-fitted peak) ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ ions in the annealed sample is almost 8 times higher
than that in the nonannealed sample, suggesting that heating under
reducing conditions can generate a significant number of Ti3+ centers. In fact, the reduction of sapphire increases the ratio
of Ti3+ to Ti4+ ions and thus this conclusion
persists.42,43 Therefore, it is common to anneal Ti:sapphire
crystals in strongly reducing environments to optimize the laser efficiency
in favor of the Ti3+ ions. By comparison, a nonannealed
sample contains a rather large (σ)(Δν) ratio of
Ti4+ emission band at 420 nm, implying that the formation
of the Ti4+ ions must be accompanied by the simultaneous
introduction of aluminum vacancies for charge compensation. This is
because local charge neutrality requires that an aluminum vacancy
be formed for every three Ti4+ ions. Thus, charge-compensating
defect centers (OO× and VAl‴) associated with the Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions should occur via the following reaction in Kröger–Vink
notation: 4  Here, TiAl× and TiAl• represent
the Ti ions with 3+ and 4+
charges, respectively, and OO× is the interstitial oxygen. Indeed, compared
to that in the Ar-reduced sample (i.e., the annealed fiber) in Figure 5d, we found that
the growth of the 40 μm sapphire core under oxidation results
in a 4-fold enhancement in (σ)(Δν) at 471 nm, indicating
the domination of Ti4+–VAl‴ in the nonannealed sample. In
addition, Ti4+–VAl‴ also acts as a hole trap in the charge-exchange
state, generally resulting in blue-green emissions in the 450–500
nm range. For the nonannealed sample, the negatively charged Ti4+–VAl‴ is likely to be compensated for by positive charges,
namely, the F+ and F2+ centers, resulting
in rather large F+ and F2+ concentrations
compared to those in the Ar-annealed sample. Thus, the enhanced oxygen
divacancy concentrations in Mg-doped sapphire single crystals result
from such a heating process in air.28,95 It should
be noted that the total (σ)(Δν) intensity of the
F+ and F2+ centers decreased by over
2-fold after annealing. Therefore, the reduction of the sapphire core
decreases the concentrations of F+ and F2+ to a greater extent than that in the nonannealed sample,
as denoted by the first two purple Gaussian deconvolutions in Figure 5c,d. This behavior
arises because heating in an inert Ar atmosphere can efficiently suppress
the occurrence of many more oxygen vacancies than heating in ambient
air. Thus, we observe a remarkable color deviation between the nearly
white light and green light produced by the absence of short-wavelength
blue emissions, as evidenced by the chromaticity coordinates in Figure 4b. Analogously, the
F+/F concentration ratio of the Ar-annealed sample was
reduced by ∼13%, which is consistent with the values obtained
by high-energy bombardment and thermochemical reduction in Ar.22

In addition to the aforementioned Ar-prepared
sample in the wavelength
range of <400 nm, it is also noteworthy that the (σ)(Δν)
intensity of the F+ center is 2 times smaller than that
of the sapphire fiber without annealing, as shown in Figure 5c,d. In contrast, in the same
sample, the F22+ center at ∼590 nm shows
an intense yellow emission with a four-fold enhancement. Thus, the
interaction after thermal annealing is expected to significantly impact
the tailoring of both the short (blue)- and long (orange)-wavelength
emissions, given the previously observed thermal-induced interconversion
between the F+ and F22+ centers.
This phenomenon was recently proven experimentally by Ramírez
et al.95 5  where ϕ is the binding energy of the
F22+ centers. For thermal treatment at 1650
°C, F+ centers aggregate more energetically and form
a cluster. The resulting Ar-annealed sapphire crystalline core contains
substantial amounts of F22+ centers, yielding
strong emission at 586 nm, as shown in Figure 5d. Accordingly, this high-temperature heat
treatment often leads to large aluminum interstitial concentrations
and observable quantities of oxygen vacancies because of their high
formation energy, as confirmed by the intense green light at 500–550
nm in Figure 5d. Alternatively,
for the sapphire fiber without annealing, the F+ center’s
mobility is too low for it to be an F22+ center,
and relatively weak luminescence at ∼590 nm is observed. Figure 6 shows the corresponding
EELS spectra of both the Ar-annealed and nonannealed glass-clad sapphire
crystal fibers. For comparison, these spectra were probed in regions
with similar thicknesses. The intensity of the O-K edge of the Ar-annealed
sample is higher than that of the nonannealed sample, demonstrating
that the oxygen concentration in the Ar-annealed sample exceeds that
in the nonannealed sample. However, as evidenced by the luminescence
analyses in Figure 5c,d, heating the sample under an inert gas can substantially reduce
the total amount of oxygen vacancies (F+, F2+, and F22+ centers) by ∼14%.
Thus, we suggest that the nonannealed sample can include numerous
misfit dislocations and stacking faults within its sapphire core,
as indicated by HRTEM and EELS. Such dislocation formation may be
responsible for the appearance of the considerable numbers of vacancies
and interstitial centers in the luminescence spectrum.

Figure 6 EELS spectra of the O-K
edge of glass-clad sapphire crystalline-core
fibers with and without annealing treatment. These results indicate
that the intensity of the first O-K peak in the sapphire core decreases
as the oxygen vacancy concentration increases.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Fabrications
of Hybrid Crystalline-Core Glass-Clad
Fibers
As shown in Figure 1a, a c axis sapphire rod with a rectangular
cross-section of 0.5 × 0.5 mm2 was used as the starting
material. The commercially available starting materials were prepared
by the Czochralski method. To engineer wideband full-color generation
and effectively facilitate the generation of F- and F2-type
color centers, ca. 50–100 ppm Ti and Cr ions were doped into
the 40 μm sapphire core. A 40 μm diameter sapphire crystalline
core was first grown at a rate of 3 mm/min in an ambient atmosphere
by the LHPG technique (see the SI and Figures S3 and S4 for details). The grown fiber can be as long as 50
cm, depending on the fiber-drawing system that is used. The 40 μm
core and cladding maintain single-crystal and amorphous structures,
respectively. Apart from the growth rate, the parameter that most
strongly affects the fiber quality is the temperature used for the
high-temperature treatment, as discussed in the Section 3. Thermal annealing treatment was performed
at 1650 °C in a strongly reducing atmosphere of 5% H2 and 95% Ar for 3 h. In the second step, the as-grown, 40 μm
core with/without thermal treatment was inserted into a borosilicate
glass capillary with a 320 μm outer diameter and grown again
using the co-drawing LHPG technique to form the borosilicate glass-clad
sapphire crystalline-core fiber. The growth rate of the glass cladding
is 6.5 mm/min. Note that the glass cladding waveguide structure in
this step was prepared in a ∼10–3 Torr reducing
atmosphere to prevent void formation.

3.2 Characterization
of Nanostructures and Optical
Properties
After the co-drawing LHPG process, the surface
morphology of the as-grown fiber was examined, and EDX analysis was
conducted by SEM (JXA-8900R; JEOL). The atomic structure at the glass-clad
sapphire crystal-core interface and the SAED pattern were investigated
by field-emission HRTEM (Tecnai G2 F20; FEI), equipped
with an EELS operating at 200 kV. The HRTEM specimen was prepared
with a dual-beam focused ion beam (FIB, SMI3050, Seiko), which can
make precise cuts in specific areas and along selected crystallographic
orientations (Figure S5). Atomic image
processing and 2D Fourier filtering of the HRTEM images were performed
using the Gatan DigitalMicrograph software. HRTEM images were compared
with diffraction patterns using the processed image to confirm the
local orientation relationship between the nanometer-sized crystallites
and the sapphire core matrix.

Wavelength-tunable full-color
and Raman experiments were conducted with a 325 nm He–Cd laser
(IK3802R-G; Kimmon Koha) as the light source and a high-spectral-resolution
spectrometer (LabRAM HR 800; JOBIN-YVON) with an 1800 mm–1 grating. A 40× objective lens with a numerical aperture of
0.50 (LMU-40X-NUV; OFR) was employed to achieve submicrometer spatial
resolution. The bright-field end view of an as-grown glass-clad sapphire
crystalline-core fiber was obtained using a metallographic microscope
(LV100ND; Nikon). The corresponding refractive index profile is shown
in Figure S6. To measure the full-color
output power, the 325 nm excitation was coupled to an 18 mm long fiber
by an objective (LMU-40X-NUV; OFR). The full-color output and the
residual excitation were first collimated by an achromatic lens with
a 10 mm focal length and further blocked by a long-wavelength-pass
filter (BLP01-325R-25; Semrock) before detection by a photodetector
(818-UV, Newport). The sensing range of the photodetector was 200–1100
nm. The filtered full-color emissions were collected by an optical
fiber (M15L02; Thorlabs) and then dispersed by a reflective holographic
grating (GH13-36U; Thorlabs) in the whole UV–visible range.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we presented an effective
and facile method of tailoring
color-tunable BLSs with ultra-broadband emissions by engineering the
defect–ligand properties. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we
designed and fabricated a sapphire crystalline core–borosilicate
glass cladding fiber with intentionally laser-introduced defects and
dopants as color emitters using the LHPG technique. Interestingly,
the full-color luminescence could be finely tuned to cover the whole
UV–visible region while retaining high crystallinity and low
waveguide loss, which remains challenging in optics and materials.
In addition, HRTEM and EELS
indicated that the full-color broadband emission resulted from an
assembly of abundant dopant-facilitated aluminum vacancies and oxygen
monovacancies and divacancies, providing high axial resolution in
air for OCT in the submicrometer range. On the basis of
these results, this study expands upon the potential for using functional
defect–ligand-driven ultra-broadband emission from crystalline
fibers in next-generation clinic endoscope-compatible diagnostic devices.
