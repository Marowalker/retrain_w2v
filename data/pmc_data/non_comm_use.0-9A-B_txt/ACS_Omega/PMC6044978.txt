A core–shell nanocarrier with
triple layers, where each
layer is sensitive to one specific physiological stimulus, has been
fabricated for highly accurate cancer therapy. The nanocarrier consists
of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (core structure for drug loading),
fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled hyaluronan (FITC–HA, first
shell for imaging with enzymatic response), disulfide bond-embedded
silica (SiO2, second layer with glutathione response),
and switchable zwitterionic surface (third layer with pH response).
The nanocarrier decorated with zwitterionic surface is able to offer
long blood circulation time due to the weak nonspecific protein absorption.
After these nanocarriers were gradually gathered around tumor cells
through enhanced permeability and retention effect, the zwitterionic
surface could switch to positive charge in low-pH environment, which
was in favor of cellular uptake due to the strengthened positive nanocarrier–negative
cellular membrane interaction. Once internalized into tumor cells,
the high concentration of glutathione in cytoplasm could cleave disulfide
bonds to remove the SiO2 shell and the HA layer would be
exposed, which would be further degraded by hyaluronidase to trigger
payload release. The fluorescent spectrum and images reveal that both
glutathione and hyaluronidase are required for the release of preloaded
drugs from these nanocarriers. By employing the multiple response,
our nanocarriers could achieve effective antibiofouling ability while
maintaining enhanced cellular internalization and targeted drug delivery,
resulting in preferred cancer cell cytotoxicity, which is much higher
than that of free doxorubicin. The in vitro data exhibited that our
nanocarriers may provide an effective strategy for accurate cancer
treatment.

Introduction
Nanocarrier for drug
delivery has attracted increasing interest
in localized chemotherapy, offering potential solutions to decrease
adverse effects and improve therapeutic efficacy for tumor therapy.1−3 Typically, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), which show tremendous
advantages, such as large surface area, abundant surface functionalization
sites, and ease of cell internalization, have been widely used for
drug delivery.4−6 In addition, silica-based materials were considered
to have good biocompatibility and biodegradability, which gradually
degraded to orthosilicic acid, drained by the blood or lymphatic system,
and finally excreted through the kidneys.7 This clear metabolism indicates no toxicity of the silica-based
materials.8 However, an ideal MSN nanocarrier,
which is able to (1) circulate in blood for long time, (2) selectively
accumulate around tumor tissue, (3) effectively uptake by tumor cells,
and (4) intracellularly release antitumor drug, has not been developed.

Accordingly, “stealthy” poly(ethylene glycol)-modified
MSNs with tumor-targeting moieties at terminal are rationally designed
to realize enhanced circulation of the nanocarriers and effective
cancer cell internalization.9,10 However, the introduction
of active targeting ligands, e.g., arginine-glycine-aspartate peptide,
only yields limited benefits to the two procedures mentioned above.11 As to further address this issue, our group
developed an MSN with pH-responsive zwitterionic surface, which would
adjust the antibiofouling ability of the nanocarriers to promote internalization
to cancer cells after preferential aggregation around solid tumor
by changing zwitterionic surface to positive charge.12 Nevertheless, the resultant positive charge on MSNs could
inhibit the release of positively charged drugs, meanwhile absorb
plenty of negatively charged drugs, resulting in an obvious limitation
of these nanocarriers. Thus, MSNs covered by degradable shield with
switchable zwitterionic surface, where the surface would “turn
on” the antibiofouling property for prolonged blood circulation
while losing the antibiofouling ability in solid tumor, and then the
degradable shield being easily removed in tumor cells to trigger the
payload release and eliminate the influence of surface charge, are
required.

Various degradable shields with stimuli responsiveness
to specific
triggers, including pH,13−16 light,17 redox,18−20 magnetic field,21 light-enzyme,22 pH-enzyme,12,23−25 pH-redox,26 and pH-adenosine triphosphate,27 have been successfully introduced to MSNs to
ensure payload release only in given cell types for optimal cancer
therapy. However, the drug release from these systems either only
relied on single stimulus or required external triggers to assist.
The former may cause certain amount of drug release at unexpected
location, whereas the latter may complicate the chemotherapy. In addition,
the combination of the stimuli-responsive cleavable shield with switchable
zwitterionic surface to MSNs has not been reported yet. Inspired by
our previous work, we intend to fabricate a drug-delivery capsule
covered by shield with multiple functions, which simultaneously offer
the prolonged blood circulation time, efficient tumor internalization,
and stimuli-responsive drug release. In addition, these stimuli as
mentioned above originate from the biochemical pathology so that the
drug release could only happen in disease place and at designed time.

In view of the above, we fabricated a nanocomposite by mesoporous
silica nanoparticles, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled hyaluronan
(FITC–HA), disulfide bond-embedded silica (SiO2),
and pH-responsive zwitterionic surface terminal with −COO– and −N+(Me)3 for tumor
therapy and imaging, which is denoted as MSN–HA–SiO2–N-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride
(TSA)/2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (DMA) (Scheme 1). The pH-responsive zwitterionic layer prevents
nonspecific protein adsorption during circulation (alkaline environment)
and provides efficient internalization into tumor cells (acidic environment)23,28 due to the pH-induced charge reversal. When the nanoparticles are
around healthy cells (HaCaT cells, pH = 7.4), the zwitterionic surface
terminal with −COO– and −N+(Me)3 would offer high resistance to cell endocytosis.
The net charge of the nanoparticles would switch from zwitterionic
to positive charge in the acidic environment surrounding tumor cells
(e.g., HeLa cells) owing to the cleavage of the negatively charged
−COO– group and the formation of positively
charged NH3+. The positive nanoparticles are
easy to bind with tumor cell membrane, which has negative charge,
leading to preferential uptake of these nanoparticles by tumor cells.
The MSN’s core serves as a container for efficient loading
of antitumor drug, whereas HA and disulfide bond are in charge of
intracellular drug release, due to the degradation triggered by high
concentration of hyaluronidase (HAase) and glutathione (GSH) in tumor
cells.29,30 Moreover, the introduction of FITC results
in the ability of real-time drug tracing and selective tumor cell
imaging.

and
Zwitterionic Surface Multiple-Functionalized MSN (MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA), as Well as the Selective Cell Internalization,
Targeted Drug Delivery, and Responsive Drug Release in Tumor Cell
Based on This Nanocarrier
Results and Discussion
MCM-41-type mesoporous silica
nanoparticles (MSNs) were fabricated
through a sol–gel approach catalyzed by base using cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) as structure-directing agent. To fabricate the MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA nanocarriers, the resulting MSNs were derivatized
with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to introduce the amine groups
(MSN-NH2). Then, the HA shell was formed on the exterior
surfaces of MSN-NH2 through strong Coulombic interaction
and hydrogen bonds between amino groups and HA (MSN–HA). The
plenty of hydroxyls on HA were not only used to introduce fluorescein
isothiocyanate (MSN–HA–FITC), but also serve as reaction
points for further sol–gel process with tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) and bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]disulfide to generate the
silica shell with disulfide bond embedding (MSN–HA–SiO2).31 The resulting MSN–HA–SiO2 was then modified by N-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium
chloride (TSA) and APTES with a ratio of 1:1, following the conversion
from amino groups to carboxyl group by reacting with 2,3-dimethylmaleic
anhydride (DMA) to form the final zwitterionic surface terminal with
−COO– and −N+(Me)3, which was denoted as MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA.
The resultant MSN-NH2, MSNs–HA–FITC, MSN–HA–SiO2, and MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

As shown in Figure 1a, the as-synthesized MSN-NH2 has a round shape with diameter
of about 150 nm and an ordered arrangement of lattice array. Figure 1b obviously shows
5 nm thick organic layers on the MSNs, demonstrating the successful
immobilization of HA. After silica coating, the shell increased to
about 25 nm (Figure 1c), which has no obvious change after zwitterionic layer formation
(Figure 1d). A similar
contrast between the new shell and the MSN core verified the successful
generation of silica layer on MSNs.

MSNs (MSN-NH2), (b) FITC–HA-fabricated MSN-NH2 (MSN–HA–FITC), (c) breakable organosilica matrix-covered
MSN–HA–FITC (MSN–HA–SiO2),
and (d) switchable zwitterionic surface-modified MSN–HA–SiO2 (MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA).

The size distributions of MSN-NH2, MSNs–HA–FITC,
and MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA were also
investigated by dynamic light-scattering measurements. As shown in Figure S1, the size of MSN significantly increased
from 100 to 160 nm after the formation of hydrophilic HA shell, which
presents larger radius of hydration than its real size. The further
enhancement of the nanoparticle size to about 180 nm was observed
after relative hydrophobic SiO2 modification, demonstrating
the stepwise synthesis of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA.

The stepwise synthesis and functionalization of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA were also investigated by IR spectra, ζ-potential
measurement, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and fluorescence spectrum
(Figures S2–S5), which, respectively,
present (1) characteristic covalent bond vibrations of HA, TSA, and
DMA; (2) different charges of various MSNs in agreement with the electrical
properties of their grafted groups (amine, HA, SiO2-OH,
ammonium, and carboxyl); (3) exact weight percentage of each component;
and (4) the characteristic emission peak of FITC at about 520 nm,
revealing the successful formation of the MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA core–shell nanocarrier with triple
shells.

The pH-responsive zwitterionic property of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA was investigated by ζ-potential measurements
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at different pH values. Figure 2a shows that the
charge on the surface of the nanocarriers is neutral at pH 7.4 after
co-functionalization of zwitterion (TSA and DMA), whereas the surface
charge returns to the primary value without DMA modification (positive
charge) because of the acid-triggered cleavage of linkages among amines
and DMA.32 The zwitterionic surface and
positive surface showed opposite performance for nonspecific protein
resistance, where the protein absorption percentage of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA at pH 6.8 (83%) is about 7 times larger than
that of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA at pH
7.4 (12%), indicating that our MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA could not only prevent biosystem clearance (pH 7.4),33 but also able to be preferentially captured
and internalized by tumor cells (pH 6.8).34 The GSH-responsive cleavage of silica shell and the enzyme (HAase)-induced
degradation of HA shell were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA, Figure 2c). As
can be seen from this figure, the percentage of organic matter in
MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA dropped from about
25 to 20% after the GSH treatment, and a further 15% of organic matter
was lost after addition of HAase into the GSH solution, which come
from the loss of TSA/DMA, organosilica matrices, and HA. Moreover,
the TGA curve and the residual ratio of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA after GSH and GSH/HAase treatment, respectively,
match the data of MSNs–HA and MSNs, indicating that most of
silica shell and HA shell were effectively removed from MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA under appropriate condition. The dual stimuli-responsive
decomposition results in the release of fluorescent probe (FITC),
which could be used to track the metabolism and release procedure
of preloaded drugs (Figure 2d).

As a nanocarrier for biomedical
applications, the stability of
MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA under physiological
condition is also important, which has been investigated by TEM after
incubation in PBS and serum for 7 days (Figure S6). As can be seen from this image, there is no obvious change
of the size and morphology of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA after the incubation, which means that MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA is quite stable under physiological condition.

Doxorubicin (DOX), a model anticancer drug, was selected to evaluate
the drug loading and stimuli-responsive release of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA. The drug-loading capacity and encapsulation
efficiency of MSN-NH2 and MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA at different mass ratios of DOX/MSNs are available
in Table S1. The DOX-loading capacity gradually
raised to 31.2 and 24.9 wt % for MSN-NH2 and MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA, respectively, when the mass ratio of DOX/MSNs
increased to 1:2. Further increase of the DOX would not change the
number, which indicates that the saturated loading capacities of MSN-NH2 and MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA for
DOX are 31.2 and 24.9 wt %, respectively. The encapsulation efficiencies
of MSN-NH2 and MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
showed peak values of 98.5 and 91.8 wt %, respectively, and then decreased
due to overloading. These data show that both MSN-NH2 and
MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA exhibit high drug-loading
capacity, and the surface modification would cause a small drop of
the drug-loading capacity and efficiency, due to the DOX leak from
the nanoparticles during the functionalization.

To evaluate
the performance of MSNs–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
for real antitumor therapy, the stimuli-responsive
release of drug from this nanocarrier was investigated under different
solutions (PBS buffer in the presence of 10 mM GSH and 0.1 mg/mL HAase
or GSH/HAase) to mimic the biosystem. The amount of DOX released from
MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA was analyzed by
fluorescence spectrometry through monitoring the fluorescence intensity
of the DOX in the solution. As shown in Figure 3a, there is no visible DOX release from the
nanocarrier before triggering even after 20 h incubation (pH 7.4).
After GSH addition (silica shell removal from the nanocarrier by cleavage
of disulfide bond), a slight leakage of DOX about 5% appeared, which
could be attributed to small amount of physical absorption. However,
the DOX release immediately appeared after further addition of HAase,
owing to the enzyme-induced degradation of the HA layer, which ends
in 40 h with over 90% DOX release. The corresponding fluorescence
spectrum is displayed in Figure 3b, which shows the obvious characteristic peak of both
DOX and FITC after the stepwise treatment of GSH and HAase. The release
profiles of DOX from MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
in the solution containing only HAase, only GSH, and HAase/GSH were
also compared (Figure S7). As can be seen
from this figure, only 3 and 8% of DOX were released from MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA after up to 48 h incubation in PBS with only
HAase and only GSH, respectively. It can be attributed to the full
sealing of MSN by the antibiofouling property of TSA/DMA, SiO2 shell, and HA layer, which would effectively encapsulate
DOX and prevent the DOX release. However, the obvious DOX release
appeared after treatment by both HAase and GSH, which reach about
92% within 48 h incubation. These results not only show that GSH and
HAase are all needed to induce DOX release from MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA, but also further verify the drug-tracking
ability of our nanocarrier, due to the concomitant DOX and the FITC
probe.

release kinetics of doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA. (b) The corresponding UV–vis absorption
spectra of DOX, FITC, and DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA after GSH/HAase treatment.

As to further understand the necessity of each
component of our
design, the release profile of DOX from MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA with no disulfide bonds in the SiO2 shell was also investigated (Figure S8). Briefly, we used only 100 μL of TEOS to fabricate the silica
shell for the control nanoparticle instead of using 30 μL of
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 70 μL of bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]disulfide
for the nanoparticle containing disulfide bonds. Figure S8 indicates that only very tiny amount of DOX appeared
in the solution even after up to 48 h incubation in PBS with glutathione
(GSH) and hyaluronidase (HAase), due to the complete block of DOX
fully covered by SiO2 shell. However, the MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA with disulfide bonds presented sustained DOX
release in 48 h and ended with over 90% of final release. These results
indicate that the introduction of disulfide bonds to form a cleavable
SiO2 shell is required for effective drug delivery.

To further investigate the mechanism of the responsive drug release,
the hydrodynamic size change of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA after treatment by GSH and HAase was measured by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure S9). As can be seen from this figure, the size of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA decreased to about 125 nm after 48 h treatment
with GSH and HAase, which is close to the size of MSN-NH2, indicating the complete removal of the SiO2 shell and
HA shell. These results demonstrate that the DOX release comes from
the decomposition of the SiO2 shell and HA shell.

To confirm the integration behavior of the MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA for selective imaging and targeted drug delivery,
DOX-encapsulated nanocarriers were incubated with Hela (human cervical
carcinoma cell) and HaCat (human keratinocyte cell) and then a fluorescence
microscope was used to investigate endocytosis of the nanocarriers
and DOX release in both Hela and HaCat cells (Figures 4 and S10). As
shown in these figures, yellow fluorescence (merging of the green
FITC and red DOX) is strongly localized in the Hela cells after 1
h incubation and no obvious DOX fluorescence (red) was observed in
both cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating the effective drug-tracking
property, enhanced tumor-selective ability, and negligible premature
release. Extending the incubation time to 12 h makes more DOX enter
into the nucleus of Hela cells, accompanied by plenty of green dots
(FITC) dispersed in the cytoplasm. The disassembly of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA to green and red parts could be attributed
to the stepwise decomposition of the disulfide bond-containing SiO2 shell and the hyaluronic acid layer by the high concentration
of glutathione and hyaluronidase in cytoplasm, which would expose
the MSN core and trigger the DOX release. The DOX would quickly enter
the nucleus owing to the DOX’s natural property,25 whereas the FITC bound to hyaluronic acid fragment
would be located in the cytoplasm, resulting in plenty of green fluorescence
in the cytoplasm and red fluorescence only in the nucleus. The persistent
green fluorescence in tumor cells would serve as fluorescent probe
for specific cell imaging. As particle-associated DOX would show concurrent
green and red fluorescence, which could not pass the nuclear pore
owing to size mismatch, the separation of green and red fluorescence
as well as the existence of DOX in nucleus lead us to believe that
DOX has been released from the MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA.35 For HaCaT cells, only
weak red fluorescence and few green dots appeared in HaCat cells even
after 24 h incubation, demonstrating the tumor-targeted DOX delivery
and selective tumor cell imaging by MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA. As a comparison, the internalization behavior of
free DOX to Hela cells and HaCaT cells was also investigated, exhibiting
similar low internalization percentages in these two types of cells.
All of these results indicated the integration behavior of the MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA for selective imaging and targeted drug delivery.

microscopy images of Hela cells (tumor cell) and HaCaT
cells (normal cell) after incubation with free DOX and DOX-loaded
MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA for 1 and 12 h.
The scale bar is 50 μm.

As to further verify our design, DOX-loaded irresponsive
zwitterionic
MSNs, DOX-loaded positive MSNs, and DOX-loaded MSNs before TSA and
DMA modification (MSN–HA–SiO2) were also
used as controls to investigate the Hela cell uptake (Figures S11 and S12). As can be seen from Figure S11, only a tiny amount of fluorescent
nanoparticles could be observed even after up to 24 h incubation for
the group of irresponsive zwitterionic nanoparticles. Moreover, the
nucleus is pure blue and all nanoparticles are orange or yellow, which
is a mixture of red DOX and green MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA, indicating all DOX has been well encapsulated in
the nanoparticles. It is obvious that the irresponsive zwitterionic
nanoparticles could not enter the cytoplasm, where the high concentration
of glutathione and hyaluronidase would quickly decompose these nanoparticles
to release DOX.25 The tiny amount of fluorescent
nanoparticles appeared in the image could be attributed to physical
deposition during incubation. However, strong red fluorescence (DOX)
appeared in the Hela nucleus only in 24 h incubation, accompanied
by plenty of green dots (FITC-labeled nanoparticles) dispersed in
the cytoplasm, demonstrating the effective uptake of nanoparticles
and following DOX release. These results indicate that the zwitterionic
nanoparticles would offer high resistance to cell endocytosis, whereas
the positive nanoparticles are easy to uptake by cell.

The data
of cellular uptake of DOX-loaded MSNs before TSA and DMA
modification (MSN–HA–SiO2) are provided in Figure S12. As shown in the figure, plenty of
red DOX appeared in the Hela cell nucleus within 12 h incubation,
accompanied by strong green fluorescence (FITC) dispersed in the cytoplasm,
whereas the intensities of both the red and green fluorescences are
all weaker than those of the group of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA. These results indicated that MSN–HA–SiO2 could be taken by cancer cells and then release DOX, but
the uptake efficiency is relatively lower than that of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA.

3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT)
assays were applied to evaluate the tumor therapy efficiency of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA because the selective cellular internalization
and stimuli-triggered drug release were expected to show high performance
and specific cytotoxicity only to tumor cells. Thus, the in vitro
cytotoxicities of Hela cells and Hacat cells were collected after
co-culture with DOX or DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA with the same amount of DOX (0.1 μg/mL) against
different periods of time (Figure 5). As can be seen from the figure, pure DOX exhibited
equally low cytotoxicity to either normal or tumor cells. Nevertheless,
using MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA to deliver
DOX can enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX to Hela cells with only 25%
cell viability after 48 h incubation. In addition, the in vitro anticancer
capacity of DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
to Hela cells was 3-fold higher than that to HaCat cells after 48
h incubation. This is because of the different cellular microenvironments
(acidity) around these two types of cells, which could either trigger
or inhibit the switch of zwitterionic surface of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA, resulting in disparate cellular uptake and
toxicity. These data not only exhibit that MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA enhances the anticancer capability of encapsulated
DOX, but also endow the encapsulated DOX with a highly selective cytotoxicity
to cancer cells.

Figure 5 Viability of Hela cells and HaCaT cells incubated with
(a) doxorubicin
(DOX)-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA and
(b) free DOX with increasing incubation time and the same amount of
DOX (0.1 μg/mL).

The cytotoxicities of DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2 to Hela cells and HaCat cells were explored as negative control.
As shown in Figure S13, similar cytotoxicity
to either Hela cells or HaCat cells was also observed due to the equal
cellular uptake efficiency of MSN–HA–SiO2 to both cancer and normal cells. Moreover, the anticancer capacity
of DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2 to tumor cells
is weaker than that of DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA, which could be attributed to the enhanced endocytosis
of the positive MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
in the acid tumor environment.

The cytotoxicity of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
without drug loading was also evaluated by the MTT method (Figure S14). As shown in Figure S14, the pure MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
was nontoxic to either Hela or HaCaT cells even at 100 μg/mL
and with 48 h incubation. These data further exhibit that (1) DOX
is the source of the cytotoxicity of our system instead of nanocarriers
and (2) the MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA exhibits
safety and efficacy for fighting cancer even at high doses.

Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated an MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA nanocarrier using MSNs (core for drug loading),
FITC–HA (enzyme-degradable shell with fluorescent probe), disulfide
bond-embedded silica (GSH disintegrable shell), and switchable zwitterionic
surface (shell with pH-induced bioantifouling) for targeted tumor
therapy and imaging. Owing to the multiple-response-assisted drug-delivery
strategy, the nonspecific absorption of these nanocarriers to proteins
was greatly suppressed during blood circulation, whereas the cellular
uptake would be enhanced in the acidic tumor microenvironment. After
the selective internalization to tumor cells, the DOX inside the orifice
of MSNs would be released in the cytoplasm due to the complete removal
of the HA shell and SiO2 shell induced by the high concentration
of GSH and HAase. Moreover, the whole procedure could be effectively
tracked by the FITC probe with green fluorescence. These properties
of high deactivation during blood circulation, preferential uptake
by tumor cells, as well as intracellular drug release indicate that
our MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA provided a
promising prospect to achieve accurate therapy for tumor eradication.

All of the chemicals and reagents used in this study were of analytical
grade and used as received without further purification. GSH was obtained
from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., and HAase was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

Preparation of Amino Group-Functionalized
Mesoporous Silica
Nanosphere through Disulfide Linkage (MSN-NH2)
MCM-41-type MSNs were fabricated through a sol–gel approach
catalyzed by base using CTAB as structure-directing agent. First,
52.8 mL of NH3·H2O (29 wt % NH3 in water) was added to 1000 mL of deionized water containing 1.12
g of CTAB with magnetic stirring. After that, 5.8 mL of tetraethyl
orthosilicate was added with rapid stirring, followed by heating up
to 50 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the mixture was placed overnight
and then purified by repeating centrifuge and water/ethanol wash.
To obtain the MCM-41-type MSNs, we used acidic methanol (9 mL of HCl/400
mL of methanol) to extract the surfactant templates at 70 °C
for 36 h, which were then dried under vacuum for 20 h after completely
washed with water and ethanol. The as-synthesized MSNs were suspended
in 50 mL of anhydrous ethanol containing APTES (1 mL, 50% in ethanol),
followed by stirring for 12 h. The resulting powder was dried under
vacuum to get MSN-NH2 after completely washed with water
and ethanol.

Drug Loading and FITC–HA Shell Formation
on MSN-NH2
To load doxorubicin (DOX) into MSN-NH2 and introduce the hyaluronic acid (HA) shell on the surface
as enzyme-degradable
cap, 10 mL of absolute ethanol was used to disperse 200 mg of MSN-NH2 and 0.5 g of doxorubicin. After 24 h stirring at room temperature,
10 mL of HA solution (5% in water) was added into the suspension and
agitated for another 8 h. The resulting powder was dried under vacuum
after several times washing with water and ethanol to get DOX-loaded
MSN–HA.

Furthermore, the DOX-loaded MSN–HA was
then suspended in 50 mL of absolute ethanol containing 0.1 g of fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) under vigorous stirring. The mixture was agitated
for 3 days, following by filtration and washing with copious ethanol
by a fritted funnel. To achieve the complete removal of the unbound
FITC, persistent washing was performed until there is no visible color
in the eluant. The resulting MSN–HA–FITC was allowed
to dry at room temperature overnight.

formation of disulfide bond-embedded silica shell on MSN–HA–FITC
was exactly prepared according to our previous work,36 the only difference is using MSN–HA–FITC
to replace protein.

Surface Functionalization of MSN–HA–SiO2
The resulting MSN–HA–SiO2 powder
was suspended in anhydrous ethanol. Then, N-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium
chloride (TSA) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) were added
with a mole ratio of 1:1. After 24 h stirring, the product (MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/APTES) was dried overnight under vacuum and thoroughly
washed with ethanol.

The obtained MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/APTES (200 mg) was suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide
(6 mL) with 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride DMA (70.2 mg, 0.58 mmol).
After 20 min deaeration by N2, triethylamine (0.2 mL) and
pyridine (0.2 mL) were injected under N2 atmosphere. The
suspension was then reacted for another 24 h and dried under vacuum
after ethanol wash to get the zwitterionic mesoporous silica nanoparticle
(MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA).

Drug-Loading
Capacity and Encapsulation Efficiency Measurements
Quantitative
analyses of loaded DOX for MSN-NH2 and
MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA were conducted
by fluorescence spectroscopy at 590 nm (Em). The DOX-loading capacity
and encapsulation efficiency were obtained by the following equations    

pH-Induced
ζ-Potential Change of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA was suspended
in 0.1 mg/mL PBS solution with pH 6.8
or 7.4, followed by different incubation times at 37 °C. Periodically,
part of the solution was withdrawn and measured by a particle analyzer
(Delsa Nano C System, Beckman Coulter). Measurements were performed
30 times for each sample, and the results were treated by Delsa Nano
software version 2.31.

Antibiofouling Property of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich)
was used as a model protein to investigate the antibiofouling property
of MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA by protein
adsorption measurements. MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA
was first mixed with PBS solution (pH 6.8 or 7.4) containing BSA for
1 day incubation at 37 °C. Then, 200 μL of the solution
was withdrawn after vortex to ensure homogeneity and centrifuged at
10 000g for 5 min to collect the aggregate
of the protein-adsorbed MSNs. The residual protein was analyzed using
UV–vis spectroscopy by measuring the peak signal at 280 nm.

In Vitro Drug Release
DOX-encapsulated MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA nanocarriers were placed in simulated biosystem
(i) PBS buffer with pH 7.4; (ii) PBS buffer with pH 7.4, GSH; (iii)
PBS buffer with pH 7.4, GSH and HAase at room temperature. After that,
2 mL of supernatant was withdrawn at designed time point and analyzed
by fluorescence spectroscopy after centrifugation to measure the content
of DOX released from the nanocarriers (Em at 590 nm).

Confocal Microscopy
Analysis of Tumor Targeting and Selective
Drug Delivery
To observe the selective tumor-targeting drug
delivery of the DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA,
Hela cells (cancer cells) and HaCaT cells (normal cells) were employed.
The cells were first seeded at 24-well plates containing glass coverslips
with a concentration of 2.5 × 104 per well. Then,
these cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibico) and
penicillin–streptomycin (100 U/mL and 100 μg/mL, Gibico),
followed by 1 day incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. On the following day, DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA containing 0.1 μg/mL DOX and/or 0.1
μg/mL free DOX was added to the cells. The cells were stained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Life Technologies). Then,
the following procedures were conducted: 1 and 12 h incubation, PBS
rinsing, 4% paraformaldehyde fixing, and permeabilization in 0.1%
Triton X-100. Afterward, the cells were rinsed and mounted and the
fluorescence was recorded by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51,
Olympus, Japan).

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Analysis
Hela
cells and HaCaT
cells were seeded in a 96-well plate with a concentration of 3 ×
103 per well for 24 h before treatment. These cells were
exposed to DOX only and equivalent DOX-loaded MSN–HA–SiO2–TSA/DMA with a DOX concentration of 0.1 μg/mL
for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Then, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to measure cell viability following
the manufacture’s protocol. The absorbance of the wells at
570 nm was read through Varioskan Flash multimode reader (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

Characterization
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM)
images were collected on a Philips CM200 transmission electron microscope
under the operation voltage of 200 kV. The TEM samples were obtained
by dropping 5 μL of solution onto carbon-coated copper grids.
All of the TEM images were visualized without staining. The IR spectra
were measured by an AVATAR 320 FT-IR spectrometer. The ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectra were measured by a Hitachi U-2910 spectrophotometer.
All pH values were measured by a Sartorius BECKMAN F 34 pH meter.
The ζ-potentials were measured by a Delsa Nano C particle analyzer
(Beckman Coulter) running Delsa Nano software and using 4 mW He–Ne
laser operating at a wavelength of 633 nm and an avalanche photodiode
detector. In vitro and intracellular releases were, respectively,
monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy
using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a fluorescent lamp;
Ex = 488 nm, Em = 590 nm for DOX and Ex = 488 nm, Em = 520 nm for
FITC.
