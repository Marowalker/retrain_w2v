A facile and efficient
protocol has been
developed for mild construction of fused pyrimidines via l-proline-catalyzed reaction of 4-hydroxy coumarins, aldehydes, and
2-aminobenzothiazoles/urea. The reaction has been carried out rapidly
and efficiently in water under mild and metal-free conditions. Current
etiquette has efficiently synthesized the heterocycles and avoids
the use of hazardous solvents over conventional organic solvents.
A plausible reaction mechanism has been established in this study.
This study represents the first case in which l-proline as
a homogeneous catalyst has been explored in the synthesis of fused
pyrimidines in water in view of simple procedure and acceptable efficiency.
This method gives the target product in excellent yield with ease
of workup.

1 Introduction
Multicomponent
reactions (MCRs) are emerging
as a useful tool for the preparation of complex molecules with high
efficiency via single step over the multistep synthesis. Worldwide,
MCR has been explored as an efficient tool for the synthesis of many
active drugs.1,2 MCRs offer several advantages
such as one-pot rather than multistep for target compound synthesis
and avoid unnecessary expensive purification, high atom economy, toxic
reagents, and solvents.3

Proline
is a bifunctional chiral organocatalyst which has advantages over
other catalysts such as inexpensive, efficient, and readily available.4l-Proline possesses acidic (−COOH)
and basic (−NH) moieties and catalyzed chemical transformations
similar to enzymatic catalysis.5l-Proline has effectively catalyzed various organic transformations,6,7
direct catalytic asymmetric aldol,8 Mannish,9 Michael,10 Diels–Alder,11 α-amination reaction,12 Knoevenagel-type condensation,13 Biginelli reaction,14 and asymmetric
Hantzsch reaction.15

Thiazole moiety
is a ubiquitous scaffold and has involved in many natural and synthetic
molecules having interesting activities such as antiviral, anticancer,
antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, antiparkinson, and anti-inflammatory
activities.16−23 Similarly, coumarin moieties have involved in plants24 and have shown anticoagulation, antiviral,25 anti-inflammatory,26 antibacterial,27 and anticancer28 activities. Fused pyrimidines,29 chromenopyrimidine,30 and pyrimidines
have also been reported as antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory,
antihypertensive activities,31−33 calcium channel modulators,34 and antimicrobial
agents.35−37 Coumarins and
their derivatives (Figure 1A) such as warfarin, coumatetralyl, and difenacoum are used
as an anticoagulant, whereas phenprocoumon and bromadiolone have antiviral
and potent rodenticide, respectively.38 Carbochromen39 is an effective coronary
vasodilator. In organic and medicinal chemistry, 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones have great importance among other promising categories.40 Some drugs have a pyrimidine core in their structure
such as monastrol (A),41 trimethoprim
(B),42 and zidovudine (C)43 (Figure 1B).

Figure 1 Some drugs with coumarin (A) and pyrimidine
(B) core.

In our ongoing research interest
to explore novel and convenient synthetic protocols for the construction
of bioactive heterocyclic derivatives,44 we report, herein, an alternative protocol for the three-component
synthesis of fused pyrimidines in the presence of l-proline
in water at 70 °C (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Fused
Pyrimidines
2 Results
and
Discussion
Initially, we studied the one-pot reaction of
4-hydroxy coumarin (5 mmol), benzaldehyde (5 mmol), and 2-aminobenzothiazole
(5 mmol) in water. The reaction was forwarded efficiently in water
with good yield and time. However, water is a green, cheap, readily
available, and efficient solvent for clean synthesis. That is why
water has chosen as a green solvent for the first eco-friendly approach
for the synthesis of pyrimidines. Further, we have studied the selection
of catalyst and loading amount in water.

Different catalysts
have been used in water as an eco-friendly solvent, and results are
summarized in Table 1. It was observed that highest yield was found with l-proline
after 3 h as compared to other catalysts (Table 1, entry 3). Catalysts such as (p-toluenesulfonic acid) p-TSA, KCl, TEA, CaCl2, LiBr, H2SO4, and sulfamic acid have
afforded moderate yield with higher time as compared to l-proline (Table 1,
entries 5–11). Remaining catalysts have shown significant yield
(Table 1, entries 12–16).
Screening results have confirmed that l-proline was selected
as the best catalyst for further study.

2	l-proline (5 mol %)	4.0	87

a Isolated Yield.

To investigate
the catalyst
loading, the reaction of 4-hydroxy coumarin (5 mmol), benzaldehyde
(5 mmol), and 2-aminobenzothiazole (5 mmol) has been performed with
different amounts of l-proline (Table 1, entries 1–4) in water. Among the
screening results, it was found that excellent yield was obtained
with 10 mol % l-proline in water. There was no significant
impact on yield and time when the amount of catalyst has been increased.
That is why 10 mol % loading of l-proline as a catalyst was
the optimized amount for promoting the reaction. To confirm the time
for completion of reaction, reaction of 4-hydroxy coumarin (5 mmol),
benzaldehyde (5 mmol), and 2-aminobenzothiazole (5 mmol) has been
performed at different time intervals. After 3 h time interval, highest
yield (91%) was found (Figure 2) which could not be increased further by increasing the time
interval.

Figure 2 Comparison
of reaction time with respect to yield.

After screening the parameters, the scope of the present
methodology has been investigated in the synthesis of various substituted
fused pyrimidines using substituted aldehydes. Variety of electron-donating
(methoxy, hydroxyl, methyl, and dimethylamino) and electron-withdrawing
substituents (chloro and nitro) on aldehydes have been investigated,
and results are incorporated in Table 2. From Table 2, it is clear that the reaction was performed smoothly with
parasubstituents. Further, the synthesized pyrimidines have been characterized
by spectroscopic analysis. The spectral data of synthesized fused
pyrimidines (4a–4k) confirmed the probable structures,
and characterization data have been placed in the Supporting Information. Copy of all 1H and 13C NMR spectra is incorporated in the Supporting Information.

Table 2 Synthesis of Library
of Fused Pyrimidinesa
a Reaction conditions:
4-hydroxy coumarin (5 mmol), aldehydes (5 mmol), and 2-aminobenzothiazole
(5 mmol) using l-proline (10 mol %) in water at 70 °C.

Product formation was established
using 1H NMR wherein product 4a depicted singlet
at 6.39 δ which has been assigned for C–H and multiplet
in the downfield region between 7.05–7.17 δ for three
aromatic hydrogens and adjacent to it; another sharp triplet was observed
at 7.17 δ which is assigned to two other protons of the aromatic
ring, whereas the multiplet in downfield between 7.22–7.30
δ was observed for four protons of the coumarin ring. Furthermore,
remaining aromatic protons of the benzothiazole ring were expected
in the downfield region between 7.38 and 7.51 δ as a multiplet. 13C NMR further confirmed the structure of 4a,
wherein the carbonyl resonates of the coumarin ring were found at
δ 167. The adjacent carbon to coumarin oxygen resonates has
been assigned at δ 152 and carbon of −C=N–
resonates at δ 142. Carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group appeared
at δ 102 and asymmetric carbon appeared at δ 68. Remaining
aromatic carbon resonates were found at δ 114–131. Molecular
ion peak in mass spectra was found at 383 [M + H] in the ESI which
confirmed the probable structure of product 4a. All of
the remaining fused pyrimidine derivatives furnished satisfactory
spectroscopic and analytical data.44i All
of the data are in good agreement according to their assigned structures.

Reaction conditions in hand, we have explored the present methodology
for the scope of substituents. To extend the scope, we used substituted
benzothiazole and 4-hydroxy coumarin with urea and guanidine. As stated
in Table 2, parasubstituted
derivatives showed significant yield of fused pyrimidines. The reaction
has undergone smoothly with the parasubstituent, leading to the formation
of product with significant yield (Table 3, 5a–5d). There was not
any significant effect of substituents on 4-hydroxy coumarin and 2-aminobenzothiazole.

Table 3 Synthesis of Fused
Pyrimidines Using Substituted Benzothioazole and 4-Hydroxy Coumarina
a Reaction conditions:
substituted 4-hydroxy coumarin
(5
mmol), derived benzaldehyde (5 mmol), and substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole
(5 mmol) using l-proline (10 mol %) in water at 70 °C.

As stated earlier, coumarin
derivatives are versatile molecules
with good biological profile according to the slight changes in their
structure. That is why, we have explored the current protocol using
urea and guanidine instead of 2-aminobenzothiazole to develop new
pyrimidines. Results are depicted in Table 4 which involve variety of electron-donating
(methoxy, hydroxyl, and dimethylamino) and electron-withdrawing substituents
(chloro and nitro) on aldehydes. Results from Table 4 clearly demonstrated that the reaction was
performed smoothly with the substituent on aldehydes. Synthesized
compounds have been characterized by spectroscopic analysis. The spectral
data of the newly synthesized fused pyrimidines (6a–6h) confirmed the probable structures and concluded in the Supporting Information. Copy of all 1H, mass, and 13C NMR spectra is placed in the Supporting Information. To further explore the
present methodology, we have examined heterocyclic aldehydes and found
no impact on yield and time.

Table 4 Synthesis of Library
of Fused Pyrimidines Using Ureaa
a Reaction conditions:
4-hydroxy coumarin (5 mmol), aldehydes (5 mmol), and urea (5 mmol)
using l-proline (10 mol %) in water at 70 °C.

It was found that this three-component
reaction has not been yet reported with guanidine. Hence, further
reaction conditions have been explored with guanidine in place of
urea or 2-aminobenzothiazole. Surprisingly, it has been found that
the reaction could not be carried out with guanidine and biscoumarin;
compound 8 was observed with poor yield instead compound 7 (Scheme 2). The structure of compound 8 was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

Scheme 2 Optimization with
Guanidine
The proposed mechanism
for the three-component reaction of 4-hydroxy coumarin (1), aldehydes (2), and 2-aminobenzothiazole (3) to synthesis fused pyrimidines (4) is shown in Scheme 3. Literature has
been supported that l-proline having dual functionality and
can catalyze aldol-related reactions such as Knoevenagel condensation
and Michael addition.45,46

Scheme 3 Proposed Reaction
Mechanism
In this reaction,
we could
suggest that first of all iminium ions may be formed by using aldehyde
catalyzed by l-proline which further facilitates the Knoevenagel
condensation for the formation of intermediate 10. Further,
2-aminobenzothiazole reacts with intermediate 10 through
Michael addition to the C=C bond and forms intermediate 11. Then, intermediate 11 reacts with amino group
and forms intermediate 12 which finally forms target
compound 4 through dehydration.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, a clean,
safe, mild, and metal-free protocol has been developed for the synthesis
of fused pyrimidines with good yield in water as a green solvent using
2-aminobenzothiazole/urea, aldehydes, and 4-hydroxy coumarin. The
results show that l-proline was successfully used in water
as a homogeneous catalyst which generates a green platform in future
for the synthesis of novel molecules. The protocol for the synthesis
of fused pyrimidines was successfully implemented with excellent yield.
Methodology has attempted the use of l-proline in the transformation
of fused pyrimidines. In terms of green solvent, water was used as
an environmental benign solvent, which is very inexpensive and having
reactivity and selectivity toward reaction media. Over traditional
methods, our method has many advantages such as simple set of workup,
single shot purification, clean synthesis, and approachable yield.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Experimental Section
All reagents such as l-proline, 4-hydroxy coumarin, aldehydes,
and so forth were of analytical grade. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE II 500 NMR spectrometer
using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as
a solvent. Purity of the compound was checked by TLC. Melting points
were determined in open capillary and are uncorrected.

4.2 Typical Procedure for Synthesis
To a round-bottomed
flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer were
added water (10 mL), l-proline (10 mol %), aldehydes (5 mmol),
4-hydroxy coumarins (5 mmol), and 2-aminobenzothiazole/urea (5 mmol).
The resulting mixture was stirred and refluxed at 70 °C. Reaction
completion has monitored by TLC analysis. After completion of reaction
that was monitored by TLC, the mixture was cooled to room temperature.
The solid was filtered and recrystallized in ethanol to provide the
fused pyrimidines.
