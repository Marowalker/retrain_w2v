To improve the efficiency
of photoinduced charge separation on
the surface of dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles, we synthesized
the Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized, Pt-cocatalyst-loaded TiO2 nanoparticles RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 (RuCP2 = [Ru(bpy)2(mpbpy)]2–, RuP4 = [Ru(bpy)(pbpy)2]6–, RuP6 = [Ru(pbpy)3]10–, H4mpbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-bis(methanephosphonic
acid), and H4pbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-bis(phosphonic
acid)) using phosphonate linkers with bridging Zr4+ ions.
X-ray fluorescence and ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra
revealed that a layered molecular structure composed of Ru(II) photosensitizers
and Zr4+ ions (i.e., RuCP2–Zr–RuP6 and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6) was successfully formed on the surface
of Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles, which increased the surface
coverage from 0.113 nmol/cm2 for singly layered RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 to 0.330 nmol/cm2 for triply layered RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2. The
photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the doubly layered RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 was three times
higher than that of the singly layered RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, whereas the activity of
triply layered RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 was less than
half of that for RuCP2@Pt–TiO2. The photosensitizing efficiencies of these Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized
nanoparticles for the O2 evolution reaction catalyzed by
the Co(II)-containing Prussian blue analogue [CoII(H2O)2]1.31[{CoIII(CN)6}0.63{PtII(CN)4}0.37]
decreased as the number of Ru(II)-photosensitizing layers increased.
Thus, crucial aspects of the energy- and electron-transfer mechanism
for the photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution reactions
involve not only the Ru(II)-complex-TiO2 interface but
also the multilayered structure of the Ru(II)-photosensitizers on
the Pt–TiO2 surface.

Introduction
To effectively address
global energy concerns, solar water splitting
is one of the most promising reactions to generate clean and renewable
energy resources (i.e., dihydrogen and dioxygen) from water without
the formation of environmental pollutants.1−7 From the pioneering work on TiO2 by Honda and Fujishima,1 extensive efforts have been devoted to develop
various types of solar water splitting systems, including not only
heterogeneous photocatalysts based on semiconductor materials8−15 but also homogeneous photocatalytic systems based on molecular materials.16−27 Recently, an extraordinary heterogeneous solar water splitting device
was developed by Nocera and co-workers.10,11 This wireless
device, which is composed of heterogeneous O2 and H2 evolution catalysts attached to both surfaces of a central
solar cell, exhibits high solar-to-fuel efficiency (2.5%). From the
viewpoint of reducing the energy costs required to fabricate solar
water splitting devices, a photocatalyst sheet developed by Domen
and co-workers is also noteworthy.15 The
photocatalyst sheet composed of two particle-based hydrogen and oxygen
evolution photocatalysts embedded on a thin Au-conducting layer shows
good solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (1.5%), and its solution-based preparation
technique is thought to be effective in reducing the cost for device
preparation.

Homogeneous photocatalytic systems composed of
molecular photosensitizers
and catalysts have also been widely studied for several decades not
only to achieve a highly efficient photocatalytic system but also
to investigate the fundamental steps in the solar water splitting
reaction.4,5,16−27 Among them, a molecular photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) and its analogues have been
used widely to drive the photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution reactions in the presence of various sacrificial reagents.28−33 For example, Sun and co-workers reported a supramolecular photocatalyst
constructed from two [Ru(bpy)3]-type photosensitizing units
connected with the highly active molecular O2-evolving
catalyst [Ru(6,6′-dcbpy)(pic)2] (6,6′-H2dcbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylic acid;
pic = 4-picoline). Compared with a molecular-based multicomponent
system, the activity of the supramolecular photocatalyst was enhanced
considerably by the connection between the photosensitizing units
and the catalytic center.35−39 A similar supramolecular photocatalyst for the H2 evolution
reaction was developed by Sakai and co-workers by coupling a Ru(II)
photosensitizer with a Pt(II) water reduction catalyst; relative to
a multicomponent molecular-based system, higher photocatalytic activity
was also observed.40,41 These works clearly indicate
the importance of electron transfer, viz., the connection between
the molecular photosensitizer and the catalyst. However, in these
half reactions, sacrificial reagents also elicit negative and complicated
effects on the photocatalytic activity.42−44

Recently, dye-sensitized
photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPECs) have
been developed extensively not only to avoid the effect of sacrificial
regents but also to develop more practical devices for solar fuel
production.45−54 The well-known molecular photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3]2+ is used widely as the sensitizing dye in DSPECs because
of the efficient electron injection from the surface-bound photoexcited
[Ru(bpy)3]2+* species to the conduction band
of the semiconductor substrate (typically TiO2). Relatedly,
it has recently been established that the bonding interactions between
the [Ru(bpy)3]-type dye and the semiconductor substrate
play a crucial role in the electron injection dynamics.55−68 For example, Durrant and co-workers found that a photoexcited electron
of the surface-bound Ru(II) dye [Ru(4,4′-dcbpy)2(NCS)2] (4,4′-H2dcbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic
acid) was promptly injected from the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer
(MLCT) excited state to the conduction band of the TiO2 substrate on the picosecond time scale.57 Recently, Meyer and co-workers reported that the introduction of
an electron-accepting or electron-donating molecular layer between
the semiconductor substrate and the [Ru(bpy)3]-type dye
greatly improved the lifetime of the charge-separated state.66,67 They also reported that the energy transfer occurs in a bilayered
structure composed of two different Ru(II) photosensitizers on ZrO2 nanocrystalline films.68 These
fascinating studies motivated us to prepare a semiconductor-nanoparticle-based
photocatalyst with a functional multilayered molecular structure.
In this work, we newly prepared Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized
Pt-cocatalyst-loaded TiO2 nanoparticle (Pt–TiO2) photocatalysts to improve the photoinduced charge separation
efficiency by the formation of a photosensitizing multilayered structure
on the surface of Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles. Three different
Ru(II) photosensitizers (Scheme 1a: RuCP2 = [Ru(bpy)2(mpbpy)]2–, RuP4 = [Ru(bpy)(pbpy)2]6–, and RuP6 = [Ru(pbpy)3]10–; H4mpbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-bis(methanephosphonic
acid) and H4pbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-bis(phosphonic
acid)) with two to six phosphonate linkers were used to regulate precisely
the redox potentials in both the ground state (Ru(III)/Ru(II)) and
the photoexcited state (Ru(III)/Ru(II)*).64 Zr4+ ions were used to form multilayered structures on
the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles, which is possible because
of their ability to bind the phosphonate groups tightly.69−73 In this paper, we report on the synthesis and photocatalytic performance
of three different Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles with photosensitizing
singly, doubly, and triply layered structures (Scheme 1b: RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, respectively).
Although the approach of employing TiO2 nanoparticles as
an electron mediator to connect the H2-evolving catalyst
and the molecular photosensitizer (so-called “through particle
mechanism”)74−82 has been reported previously, the effect of the photosensitizing
multilayered structure has scarcely been examined. Notably, we found
that the photocatalytic activity of the doubly layered RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle for the H2 evolution reaction was remarkably higher than that of the
singly layered RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle, indicating that the energy- and electron-transfer
dynamics in the Ru(II)-photosensitizing layers play a crucial role
on the photocatalytic activity for both the O2 and H2 evolution reactions.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
Energy-dispersive
X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) spectra were measured to estimate the amount of
Ru(II) complexes immobilized on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle
surface (Figure 1).
Two characteristic peaks assigned to Pt Lα and Lβ originating
from the Pt cocatalyst on the TiO2 nanoparticle were clearly
observed for all three Ru(II)-complex-immobilized nanoparticles. The
intensities of these peaks were almost comparable with that of the
Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles, indicating that the Pt cocatalyst
did not detach from the TiO2 surface during immobilization
of the Ru(II) photosensitizers. The amount of Pt on the TiO2 nanoparticles was estimated to be ca. 5.1 wt % by the intensity
ratio of the Kα peak of Ti to the Lα peak of Pt. Transmittance
electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that Pt nanoparticles with
diameters ranging from 2 to 5 nm were loaded uniformly on the TiO2 nanoparticle surface (Figure S1). In the XRF spectra of the three Ru(II)-complex-immobilized nanoparticles,
the peaks assigned to Ru Kα radiation were observed clearly,
indicating that the Ru(II) complex was successfully immobilized on
the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle surface. It is noteworthy
that the intensity ratio of Ru Kα radiation to that of Pt Lα
increased in the order of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 < RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 < RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2. In addition, Zr Kα radiation was barely observed for
Pt–TiO2 or RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, although it was observed clearly and
its intensity increased significantly in the order of RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 < RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2. Overall, these XRF spectra are
indicative of the successive immobilization of the Ru(II) photosensitizers
on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles by the Zr4+-ion linkers. In addition, TEM images of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 and RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 (Figure S1) suggest that the size of the Pt cocatalyst loaded on the
TiO2 nanoparticles barely changed in response to the immobilization
of the Ru(II) complexes. We estimated the amount of each element in
the Ru(II)-complex-immobilized nanoparticles based on these XRF spectra.
The estimated molar ratios of Ru to Pt (Ru/Pt) of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 were 0.318, 0.477, and 0.964, respectively,
clearly indicating that the amount of the immobilized Ru complexes
on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles increased in the order
of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 < RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 < RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 (Figure S2). This result also indicates that Zr4+ ions play
a key role in the successive immobilization of phosphonate-functionalized
Ru(II) photosensitizers on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles.

of Pt–TiO2 (black), RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 (red), RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 (blue), and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 (green) nanoparticles.

To fully investigate the amount of immobilized
Ru(II) complexes
on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle surface, as well as
the surface coverage per unit area (details given in the Supporting Information), ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra of the supernatant solutions were
recorded following the immobilization of RuCP2, RuP4, and RuP6 (Figure S3). The results are summarized in Table 1. The estimated surface coverage of the immobilized
Ru(II) complexes per unit area of RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 is approximately 1.5 and 2.9 times larger than that of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, respectively.
This result agrees quantitatively with the results of the XRF spectra.
The occupied area of the TiO2 surface per one Ru(II) complex
molecule (i.e., molecular footprint) was also calculated based on
the amount of immobilized Ru(II) complexes per unit area. The occupied
area of RuCP2 in RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 was estimated
to be 1.47 nm2. This value corresponds approximately to
the molecular footprint of RuCP2 (1.66 nm2, Figure S4) estimated
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, suggesting that the
TiO2 nanoparticle surface is almost fully covered by RuCP2 molecules to form a RuCP2-photosensitizing molecular layer on the
Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle surface. However, the amount
of immobilized RuP6 in RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 was slightly less than the amount
of immobilized RuCP2 in RuCP2@Pt–TiO2. This
is likely caused by the larger molecular footprint of RuP6 (2.09 nm2, Figure S5) compared with that of RuCP2 (1.66 nm2, Figure S4) on account of its six phosphonic acid groups. In fact, the molecular
size of RuP6 (679 Å) estimated
by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis is larger than that
of RuCP2 (534 Å),83 which is consistent with the smaller amount
of immobilized RuP6 than RuCP2. In addition, the electrostatic
repulsion between the negatively charged phosphonate groups may also
contribute to the lower surface coverage by RuP6. Interestingly, the amount of immobilized RuCP2 in RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 is almost identical to that in RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, suggesting that
the number of Zr4+ ions bound by the RuP6 phosphonate groups is large enough to immobilize RuCP2 to form a second photosensitizing
layer on the outer edge of the nanoparticle. However, in the case
of RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, the amount of
immobilized RuCP2 in the outer
layer was smaller than that in RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, which is probably due to the smaller
number of phosphonate groups in RuP4 than RuP6. Thus, these
results clearly indicate that self-assembled, layered molecular structures
composed of Ru(II) photosensitizers and Zr4+ ions have
been successfully constructed on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles.
In the infrared (IR) spectra of the three Ru(II)-complex-immobilized
nanoparticles (Figure S6), the symmetric
stretching band of the P–OH group at 950 cm–1, which was clearly observed in RuP6, RuP4, and RuCP2, almost disappeared following immobilization
with concomitant formation of symmetric and asymmetric stretching
modes of the P–O bond at 1000–1200 cm–1. These results suggest that Zr4+ ions were coordinated
to the deprotonated phosphonate groups of the phosphonate-functionalized
Ru(II) photosensitizers during the immobilization reaction.58 The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns
of all Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles were almost identical to that of nonimmobilized Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles (Figure S7), suggesting
that any crystalline impurities were not formed in the immobilization
reactions of the Ru(II) photosensitizers and Zr4+ cations.
The particle diameter distribution was also measured by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) (see Figure S8) to investigate
the influence of the immobilized Ru(II) photosensitizers on the dispersibility
of the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles in water. The average
particle diameters of the three Ru(II)-complex-immobilized nanoparticles
are in the range of 600–730 nm, which is comparable with that
of TiO2 and Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles. Thus,
the dispersibility of these nanoparticles in water changed very little
by the immobilization of the Ru(II) photosensitizers. Therefore, the
Ru(II) complexes were uniformly immobilized on the Pt–TiO2 surface without any growth of Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle
aggregates. In addition, particles smaller than Pt–TiO2 were not observed in the DLS measurements, suggesting that
the nanoparticles composed of only molecular Ru(II) photosensitizers
or Zr4+ ions did not precipitate separately during the
immobilization reactions.

UV–vis diffuse reflectance
and emission spectra were measured
to investigate the photophysical properties of the three Ru(II)-complex-immobilized
Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 2, both 1MLCT absorption
and 3MLCT emission bands derived from the Ru(II) photosensitizers
were observed in all three Ru(II)-complex-immobilized nanoparticles.
Clearly, these results provide additional evidence that the Ru(II)
complexes were immobilized on the Pt–TiO2 surface.
Interestingly, even when the same Ru(II)-complex concentration in
the suspended aqueous solution is used (note that the Ru(II)-complex
concentration is not uniform on account of the immobilization process,
but the amounts in the suspensions are constant at 2.5 μM),
the emission intensities of the Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized
Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles decreased significantly in
the order of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2. As mentioned in the Introduction, photoexcited electrons of Ru(II) photosensitizers
are known to be injected rapidly to the conduction band of TiO2, which quenches 3MLCT phosphorescence.55−68 Thus, one possible reason for the emission intensity decrease is
that the electron injection efficiency from the Ru(II) photosensitizer
to TiO2 is improved by increasing the number of immobilization
cycles of the Ru(II) complex. We previously reported that the shorter-lived
emission species than RuCP2 was
observed for the RuCP2@TiO2 nanoparticle without the Pt cocatalyst in the solid state.83 Considering that all three Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized
Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles were hardly emissive in the
solid state, the Pt cocatalyst loading may improve the emission quenching
efficiency. A second plausible reason is due to energy-transfer quenching
among the immobilized Ru(II) complexes.

K.

Photocatalytic H2 Evolution
Photocatalytic
water reduction was investigated using the three Ru(II)-complex-immobilized
nanoparticles (100 μM as Ru(II) complex) RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 as the photocatalytic water reduction
catalysts in the presence of 0.5 M l-ascorbic acid (H2A) as the sacrificial electron donor in aqueous solution (pH
= 2.2). The amount of H2 evolution versus time is plotted
in Figure 3, and the
results are summarized in Table 2. Blue light-emitting diode (LED) light (λ =
470 ± 10 nm) was irradiated to photoexcite the Ru(II) photosensitizers.
In all three reactions, the amount of H2 evolution increased
linearly with the irradiation time and the estimated turnover numbers
(TONs) per one Ru(II) photosensitizer were much greater than 1, indicating
that the Ru(II)-complex-immobilized Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles
act as photocatalysts for the H2 evolution reaction. By
contrast, a negligible amount of H2 was observed in the
reaction system containing [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the
molecular photosensitizer and Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles
as the water reduction catalyst (Figure S9) probably because of the low emission quenching efficiency of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ by H2A under the acidic condition.84 Therefore, the immobilization of the Ru(II)
photosensitizer on the TiO2 nanoparticles by the phosphonate
linkers is a crucial component for the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. Notably, the amount of H2 evolution,
apparent quantum yield (Φ), TON, and turnover frequency (TOF)
of RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 were
approximately three times larger than that of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, whereas those of RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 were much less than those
of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2. These results indicate that the insertion of an inner RuP6 layer between RuCP2 and the TiO2 nanoparticle surface via Zr4+ ions greatly enhances the photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution; by contrast, further insertion of a middle RuP4 layer between the inner RuP6 and outer RuCP2 layers significantly suppresses the activity.
The enhancement may be due to improved charge separation efficiency
in RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 because
the amount of Ru(II) photosensitizers in these three reactions is
equal (100 μM); that is, the optical absorption intensities
are almost comparable among the three reaction solutions. The suppression
of the photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution by the insertion
of a RuP4 middle layer may be
related to energy-transfer processes among the three different Ru(II)
photosensitizers. To clarify why the photocatalytic H2 evolution
activity depends so strongly on the structure of the Ru(II)-photosensitizing
layer immobilized on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle surface,
emission quenching experiments were performed in the presence of the
sacrificial electron donor H2A (Figure S10). Using the same molar ratio of Ru(II) photosensitizer
to H2A as that in the photocatalytic H2 evolution
reaction, the emission quenching efficiency was found to decrease
in the same order as that of the photocatalytic H2 evolution
activity (i.e., RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2). Thus, the formation of
a multilayered structure composed of Ru(II) photosensitizers and Zr4+ ions on the Pt–TiO2 surface greatly affects
the photoinduced charge separation process among the TiO2 and Ru(II) photosensitizers.

As mentioned in the Introduction, Meyer
and co-workers already reported that the energy-transfer processes
occur from photoexcited RuCP2 ([RuCP2]*) to RuP6 to generate [RuP6]* species in the RuCP2–Zr–RuP6 bilayer structure formed on a nanocrystalline ZrO2 film.68 This energy transfer from RuCP2 to RuP6 would be thermodynamically favorable because the emission energy
of RuP6 (1.91 eV = 650 nm) is
slightly smaller than that of RuCP2 (1.97 eV = 630 nm),64 which can
be attributed to the stabilized π* energy levels on the 2,2′-bipyridyl
ligands by the directly attached electron-withdrawing phosphonate
substituents. Thus, in the case of RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, the energy transfer could occur in the
same direction from the outer-layered [RuCP2]* to the inner-layered RuP6 (process (a) shown in Scheme 2) to generate [RuP6]* on the Pt–TiO2 surface, followed
by electron injection from [RuP6]* (which can be generated by both energy transfer and/or direct
photoexcitation) to the conduction band of TiO2 (process
(b) in Scheme 2). This
electron injection is known to be favorable because the redox potential
of Ru(III)/Ru(II)* in RuP6 is
more negative [−0.69 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)]64 than the conduction band minimum of TiO2 (−0.41 V vs NHE at pH = 2.2).85,86 Another possible pathway to inject an electron to TiO2 is the reductive quenching of [RuCP2]* by H2A. However, the efficiency would be negligible
because of the relatively small reductive quenching efficiency of
[Ru(bpy)3]2+ by H2A at pH = 2.2.84 Thereafter, the generated hole in [RuP6]+ could be transferred to the RuCP2 located at the outer edge of
the RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle
(process (c) in Scheme 2) because of the slightly lower Ru(III)/Ru(II) redox potential of RuCP2 (1.22 V vs NHE) than that of RuP6 (1.43 V vs NHE)64 to generate a charge-separated state in the nanoparticle
(i.e., [RuCP2]+–Zr–RuP6@Pt–[TiO2(e–)]). In this way, the excited electron in the conduction
band of TiO2 is spatially separated from the hole localized
in the outer-layered RuCP2, resulting
in suppression of charge recombination and thus a longer lifetime
of the charge-separated state. In the case of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, however, charge recombination
would occur more easily because of back electron transfer from [TiO2(e–)] to [RuCP2]+ because the hole is localized on RuCP2, which is directly bound to the Pt–TiO2 surface. This hypothesis is consistent with the results from
the emission measurements; the emission intensity of RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 was weaker than that of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 (Figure 2b), and the quenching
efficiency of RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 by
H2A is higher than that of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 (Figure S10). Thus, the formation of a long-lived, spatially charge-separated
state in [RuCP2]+–Zr–RuP6@Pt–[TiO2(e–)] could improve not only the efficiency of electron
injection from RuP6 to TiO2 via energy transfer from RuCP2 but also the reactivity of the sacrificial electron donor
by hole migration from the inner-layer [RuP6]+ to the outer-layer RuCP2, leading to an enhancement of the photocatalytic
activity of the H2 evolution reaction.

photosensitizers and l-ascorbic acid (H2A) and

By contrast, the catalytic activity of H2 evolution
of the triply layered RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 was significantly
lower than that of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, despite the presence of three different Ru(II) photosensitizers
immobilized on the Pt–TiO2 surface, as well as the
doubly layered RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2. Unfortunately,
we have not yet determined the cause of the lower photocatalytic activity
of RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, but one plausible
factor can be envisioned. The reason is that RuP4 introduced as a photosensitizing middle layer
negatively affects the direction of energy transfer. Considering the
emission energies of the three photosensitizers [i.e., RuP6, RuP4, and RuCP2 are 1.91 eV (650
nm), 1.88 eV (660 nm), and 1.97 eV (630 nm), respectively],64 thermodynamically favorable energy transfers
in the RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles
would be limited in the following two directions: (i) from the outer RuCP2 layer to the middle RuP4 layer and (ii) from the inner RuP6 layer to the middle RuP4 layer (Scheme S1).
In other words, the photoexcitation energy would concentrate on RuP4 in the middle layer, but the
photoexcited [RuP4]* could not
inject the electron to TiO2 because the distance from the
TiO2 surface to RuP4 would be too far for direct injection owing to the presence of the RuP6 inner layer (i.e., it would be
associated with a high electron-transfer barrier). In addition, indirect
electron injection via the reduction of RuP6 would also be difficult because the Ru(III)/Ru(II)*
redox potential of RuP4 (−0.74
V vs NHE) is not negative enough to reduce RuP6 (Ru(II)/Ru(I), −1.29 V vs NHE).64

Photocatalytic O2 Evolution
Photocatalytic
water oxidation was investigated using the three Ru(II)-complex-immobilized
nanoparticles (100 μM as Ru(II) complex) RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 as the photosensitizers and a Co(II)-containing
Prussian blue analogue [CoII(H2O)2]1.31[{CoIII(CN)6}0.63{PtII(CN)4}0.37] (hereafter CoPt–PBA)
as the water oxidation catalyst34 in the
presence of 5 mM Na2S2O8 as the sacrificial
electron acceptor in a 40 mM phosphate buffer aqueous solution (pH
= 7.3). The amount of evolved O2 versus irradiation time
is plotted in Figure 4, and the results are summarized in Table 3. The induction period for the initial 5
min was due to the location of the O2 detector that is
placed on the head of the sample vial. Although the concentrations
of the Ru(II) photosensitizers in these three reactions are identical
to those used in the photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions
discussed above, the TON decreased in the order of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, suggesting that the photosensitizing
efficiency for the O2 evolution reaction is suppressed
by the formation of additional Ru(II)-photosensitizing layers on Pt–TiO2 via the Zr4+ linkages. Likewise, emission quenching
experiments in the presence of various Na2S2O8 concentrations (Figure S11) suggest that the emission quenching efficiency also decreased in
the same order of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2. Given that the surfaces
of all three Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized nanoparticles are
covered by the same molecular photosensitizer (i.e., RuCP2) and that their average sizes are comparable
(see Figure S8), their distinct reactivities
in response to the Na2S2O8 sacrificial
electron acceptor could not be due to differences in the photosensitizer
sizes or surface conditions.

a 5 mM Na2S2O8 sacrificial electron
acceptor in 40 mM phosphate buffer aqueous solution (pH = 7.3) under
an Ar atmosphere. A blue LED light (λ = 470 ± 10 nm) was
used as the irradiation source.

As mentioned in the previous
section, the photoexcited energy transfer
among the Ru(II) photosensitizers could play an important role in
the charge separation process. In the case of RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, [RuP6]* in the inner layer could inject an excited electron
to TiO2 after direct photoexcitation or the energy transfer
could originate from [RuCP2]*
in the outer layer. Although this charge separation process should
positively influence H2 evolution, it would negatively
influence the O2 evolution reaction in the presence of
an electron acceptor such as S2O82–; a key process to drive this photocatalytic water oxidation reaction
is the electron transfer from the Ru(II) photosensitizer on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles to the sacrificial electron acceptor S2O82–. However, energy transfer
among the Ru(II) complexes and the subsequent electron injection to
TiO2 would suppress the electron-transfer efficiency from
the Ru(II) photosensitizer to S2O82– (Scheme S2). Therefore, the reactivity
with Na2S2O8 decreased as the number
of Ru(II) complex layers increased, resulting in lower water oxidation
activities for RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 versus RuCP2@Pt–TiO2. In other words,
the multilayered structure composed of Ru(II) photosensitizers and
Zr4+ bridging ions on Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles
acts as a photoinduced charge separator in which electrons tend to
migrate to the inside of the TiO2 nanoparticles.

Conclusions
We synthesized the Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized, Pt-cocatalyst-loaded
TiO2 nanoparticles RuCP2@Pt–TiO2, RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2, and RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 using phosphonate linkers with bridging Zr4+ ions
and investigated their photocatalytic activities for both the water
oxidation and reduction reactions. The photocatalytic O2 evolution activity in the presence of a CoPt–PBA catalyst
decreased as the number of Ru(II)-photosensitizing layers on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles increased (RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 > RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2). Notably, the photocatalytic performance
of the doubly layered
nanoparticle RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 for
the H2 evolution reaction was approximately three times
higher than that of the singly layered RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle, whereas the
activity of the triply layered nanoparticle RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 was the lowest among the three nanoparticle
systems investigated. A crucial factor for the photocatalytic activity
of these sensitized nanoparticle systems is the electron- and energy-transfer
processes in the Ru(II)-photosensitizing layers on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles. A characteristic feature was observed for
the doubly layered nanoparticle RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2. Specifically, the photoexcited energy
transfer from the outer [RuCP2]* to the inner RuP6 and the
hole transfer from the electron-injected [RuP6]+ to the outer RuCP2 are key factors for high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. However, these two processes suppress the reactivity
when S2O82– is used as the
sacrificial electron acceptor, resulting in a lower photocatalytic
performance for the O2 evolution reaction in the presence
of CoPt–PBA. The photosensitizing efficiency for O2 evolution and the photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution
of the triply layered RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 system were remarkably
lower than those of the other Ru(II)-complex-immobilized nanoparticles,
which is probably caused by the detrimental effect of the RuP4 middle layer to the energy-transfer processes.
This work clearly demonstrates that the immobilization of multilayered
structures composed of molecular Ru(II) photosensitizers and Zr4+ linkages on Pt–TiO2 surfaces is a simple
and promising method to improve the photoinduced charge separation
efficiency for solar fuel production. Moreover, this study establishes
that the key factors for higher charge separation efficiency include
the direction of the photoexcited energy transfer and the subsequent
electron transfers in the layered structure. The next important step
to achieve water splitting without the use of sacrificial reagents
must address how to transfer the hole located on the H2-evolving photocatalyst surface to the O2-evolving catalyst.
Further studies on controlling the electron- and energy-transfer processes
in Ru(II)-photosensitizing multilayered structures and the development
of a new hole-transfer mediator are now in progress.

Experimental

Synthetic Procedures
All starting materials were used
as received from commercial sources, and solvents were used without
any further purification. TiO2 nanoparticles (ca. 15 nm
in diameter) were purchased from the Sakai Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.
Unless otherwise stated, all reactions were performed in air. The
Co(II)-containing Prussian blue analogue34 [CoII(H2O)2]1.31[{CoIII(CN)6}0.63{PtII(CN)4}0.37] and the Ru(II) molecular photosensitizers
(RuCP2, RuP4, and RuP6)87,88 were synthesized using previously reported
methods. The Pt-cocatalyst-loaded TiO2 nanoparticles (hereafter
Pt–TiO2) were prepared using a previously reported
photodeposition method.89

Single-Crystal
Preparation of RuP6
The chloride salt of RuP6 (22.2
mg) was suspended in water (6 mL), and the pH was adjusted
to 6 using a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution to dissolve the suspensions.
A 5 M HCl aqueous solution (0.6 mL) was then added to this red solution.
Red RuP6 crystals began to form
after being kept at 298 K for 5 days (yield: 18.7 mg, 72%). One of
the crystals was used for X-ray diffraction analysis, whereas the
remaining crystals were dried under vacuum. Elemental analysis (%)

Preparation
of RuCP2@Pt–TiO2
The powder of Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles
(30 mg) was dispersed in acidified water (3 mL) by the addition of
a 60% HClO4 aqueous solution (50 μL). A 2.5 mM aqueous
solution of RuCP2 (3 mL) was
added to the Pt–TiO2-dispersed solution and then
stirred continuously overnight to immobilize RuCP2 on the Pt–TiO2 surface. The
obtained RuCP2-immobilized Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles (RuCP2@Pt–TiO2) were collected by ultracentrifugation
(50 000 rpm; 15 min), and the supernatant solution was removed.
After washing twice with a 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution
(ca. 6 mL), RuCP2@Pt–TiO2 was dried in air at 298 K for 1 day. The amount of RuCP2 immobilized on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle surface was estimated by using XRF and UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy of the supernatant solution (see the “Synthesis and Characterization” section
and Supporting Information).

Preparation
of RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2
The powder of Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles (30 mg) was
dispersed in acidified water (3 mL) by the addition of a 60% HClO4 aqueous solution (50 μL). To this dispersed solution,
a 2.5 mM aqueous solution of RuP6 (3 mL) was added and then stirred continuously overnight. After
ultracentrifugation (50 000 rpm; 15 min) to isolate the RuP6-immobilized Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles (RuP6@Pt–TiO2), the obtained RuP6@Pt–TiO2 precipitates were washed twice with a 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution (ca. 6 mL) and then dispersed in methanol (3 mL).
To this dispersed solution, a 20 mM methanol solution of ZrCl2O·8H2O (3 mL) was added and stirred continuously
for 1 h to bind the Zr4+ ions to the phosphonate groups
of the surface-immobilized RuP6 species. Unreacted Zr4+ ions were removed by ultracentrifugation
(50 000 rpm; 15 min) and washing twice with methanol (ca. 6
mL); the sample was then dried under vacuum at 298 K. The obtained
Zr4+-attached nanoparticles (i.e., Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2) were dispersed
again in acidified water (3 mL) by the addition of a 60% HClO4 aqueous solution (50 μL), added to a 2.5 mM aqueous
solution of RuCP2 (3 mL), and
then stirred continuously overnight to immobilize RuCP2 to the Zr4+ ions bound to the
phosphonate groups of RuP6. Finally,
the obtained RuCP2–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles
were isolated by ultracentrifugation (50 000 rpm; 15 min),
washed twice with a 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution (ca. 6
mL), and then dried in air at 298 K for 1 day. The amounts of RuCP2 and RuP6 immobilized on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle
surface were estimated by using XRF and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
of the supernatant solution (see the “Synthesis
and Characterization” section and Supporting Information).

Preparation of RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2
The
immobilization of RuP6 and binding
of Zr4+ ions were conducted by the same method outlined
above to prepare the Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles. The dried Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles
were dispersed in acidified water (3 mL) by the addition of a 60%
HClO4 aqueous solution (50 μL). To this dispersion,
a 2.5 mM aqueous solution of RuP4 (3 mL) was added and then stirred continuously overnight to form RuP4-immobilized RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles. After isolation
by ultracentrifugation (50 000 rpm; 15 min) and washing twice
with a 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution (ca. 6 mL), the obtained
nanoparticles were dispersed again in methanol (3 mL), added to a
20 mM methanol solution of ZrCl2O·8H2O
(3 mL), and then stirred continuously for 1 h to form the Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles.
After isolation by ultracentrifugation (50 000 rpm; 15 min)
and washing twice with methanol (ca. 6 mL), the obtained precipitates
were dispersed in acidified water (3 mL) by the addition of a 60%
HClO4 aqueous solution (50 μL), added to a 2.5 mM
aqueous solution of RuCP2 (3
mL), and then stirred continuously overnight. Finally, the target RuCP2–Zr–RuP4–Zr–RuP6@Pt–TiO2 nanoparticles were isolated
by ultracentrifugation (50 000 rpm; 15 min), washed twice with
a 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution (ca. 6 mL), and then dried
at 298 K in air for 1 day. The amounts of RuCP2, RuP4, and RuP6 immobilized on the Pt–TiO2 nanoparticle surface were estimated by XRF and UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy of the supernatant solution (see the “Synthesis and Characterization” section
and the Supporting Information).

Measurements
UV–vis absorption spectra and diffuse
reflectance spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2400PC spectrophotometer.
The obtained reflectance spectra were converted to absorption spectra
using the Kubelka–Munk function F(R∞). Luminescence spectra were recorded
on a JASCO FP-6600 spectrofluorometer at 298 K. Each sample solution
was deoxygenated by N2 bubbling for 30 min at 298 K. IR
spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT-IR 4100 spectrophotometer using
KBr pellets. PXRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer
equipped with a graphite monochromator using Cu Kα (λ = 1.54187 Å) radiation and a one-dimensional LynxEye
detector. DLS analysis was conducted using an OTSUKA ELSZ-1000SCl
analyzer. TEM was recorded on a JEOL 2010 FasTEM microscope (200 kV).
Energy-dispersive XRF spectra were recorded on a Bruker S2 PUMA analyzer.
Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis of RuP6 was conducted using a Rigaku XtaLAB P200 diffractometer
with graphite monochromated Cu Kα radiation and a
rotating anode generator. Diffraction data were collected and processed
using the CrysAlisPro program.90 The structure
was solved by the direct methods using SIR-2011,91 and structural refinements were conducted using the full-matrix
least-squares method with SHELXL-2013.92 Nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, whereas H atoms
were refined using the riding model. All calculations were performed
using the CrystalStructure crystallographic software package.93 The crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1 and deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre (CCDC-1542141). Although several alerts (levels A and
B) are reported, these are due to the highly disordered crystal water
molecules.

Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Reaction
Under dark
conditions, a phosphate buffer solution (40 mM, pH = 7.3) containing
a Ru(II) photosensitizer (100 μM of the Ru(II) complex) and
water oxidation catalyst (1 mg CoPt–PBA) was placed in a Pyrex
vial (volume ca. 5 mL) with a small magnetic stirring bar and covered
with a rubber septum. To this mixed solution, a Na2S2O8 aqueous solution (50 mM) was injected using
a syringe, and the resultant solution was deoxygenated by bubbling
with an Ar gas for 30 min. A robust O2 sensor probe (Pyro
Science, FireSting O2 oxygen meter) was equipped on top of the septum
to detect the oxygen concentration within the vial’s headspace.
The vial was irradiated from the bottom with a blue LED lamp (λ
= 470 ± 10 nm; 160 mW; Opto Device Lab. Ltd., OP6-4710HP2). The
temperature was controlled at 293 K using a homemade aluminum water-cooling
jacket with a water-circulating temperature controller (EYELA CCA-1111).
The TON and TOF were estimated from the amount of evolved O2, which required four photoredox cycles of the Ru(II) photosensitizer
to oxidize one water molecule. The apparent quantum yield (Φ)
was calculated using the following equation.94 1  Here, Ne stands
for the number of reacted electrons, NO2 is the number of the evolved O2 molecules,
and Np is the number of incident photons.

Photocatalytic Water Reduction Reaction
Under dark
conditions, an l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution (0.5 M, pH
= 2.2) containing a Ru(II) photosensitizer (100 μM of the Ru(II)
complex) was placed into a homemade Schlenk flask-equipped quartz
cell (volume: 265 mL) with a small magnetic stirring bar. Each sample
flask was doubly sealed with rubber septa. This mixed solution was
deoxygenated by Ar bubbling for 1 h. The flask was then irradiated
from the bottom with a blue LED lamp (λ = 470 ± 10 nm;
160 mW; Opto Device Lab. Ltd., OP6-4710HP2). The temperature was controlled
at 293 K using a homemade aluminum water-cooling jacket with a water-circulating
temperature controller (EYELA CCA-1111). The gas samples (0.3 mL)
for each analysis were collected from the headspace using a gastight
syringe (Valco Instruments Co. Inc.). The amount of evolved H2 was determined using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 490 Micro
Gas Chromatograph). The TON and TOF were estimated from the amount
of evolved H2, which requires two photoredox cycles of
the Ru(II) photosensitizer to reduce one water molecule. The apparent
quantum yield (Φ) was calculated using the following equation.94 2  Here, Ne stands
for the number of reacted electrons, NH2 is the number of the evolved H2 molecules,
and Np is the number of incident photons.
