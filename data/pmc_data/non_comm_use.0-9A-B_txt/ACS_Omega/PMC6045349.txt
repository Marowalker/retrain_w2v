Fob1 protein plays
an important role in aging and maintains genomic
stability by avoiding clashes between the replication and transcription
machinery. It facilitates polar arrest by binding to replication fork
barrier (RFB) sites, present within the nontranscribed spacer region
of the ribosomal DNA. Here, we investigate the mechanism of unidirectional
arrest by creating multiple prosthetic forks within the RFB, with
fluorescent adenine analogue 2-aminopurine incorporated site-specifically
in both the “permissible” and “nonpermissible”
directions. The motional dynamics of the RFB-Fob1 complexes analyzed
by fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay kinetics
shows that Fob1 adopts a clamp-lock model of arrest and causes stronger
perturbation with the bases in the double-stranded region of the nonpermissible-directed
forks over those of the permissible directed ones, thereby creating
a polar barrier. Corroborative thermal melting studies reveal a skewed
distribution of GC content within the RFB sequence that potentially
assists in Fob1-mediated arrest.

Introduction
Pause of DNA replication
forks at certain physiologically programmed
sites within the genome has been observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
alike.1 These sites have been programmed
for a variety of functions, from the maintenance of fidelity in the
replication process to the avoidance of clashes between the replication
and transcription machinery.2,3 In prokaryotes, this
occurs during the bidirectional replication of the circular genome,
and the process has been thoroughly investigated both structurally
and mechanistically.4,5 Analogous replication fork barrier
(RFB) sites have been observed in eukaryotes in the ribosomal DNA
(rDNA) repeat regions (100–200 repeats)6−9 (Figure S1), where polar arrest proteins like Fob1 (fork blocking) in yeast
enforce unidirectional transcription and replication. During replication,
these repeats get stochastically excised by recombination10 at the stalled forks and is one of the causes
of aging in yeast.11

Intriguingly,
the eukaryotic RFB systems do not exhibit any similarity
both at the DNA and the protein level with the prokaryotic system.
Moreover, since the discovery of Fob1, there has been very little
information regarding its domain organization and the mode of binding
of Fob1 to RFB sites. Earlier bioinformatics studies had proposed
that it has a zinc finger motif that partakes in DNA binding.12,13 Till date, because of the paucity of the X-ray structure, limited
knowledge regarding its molecular mechanism of arrest is available.
The polar nature of Fob1-mediated arrest was first demonstrated by
Brewer et al. who, by employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis,
were able to show blocking of replication intermediates.14 It was demonstrated that accumulation of forks
occurred only in an orientation-dependent manner and forks that approach
from the direction of 5S rRNA transcription are arrested. However,
the oppositely directed fork can pass through the site, unimpeded.14,15 Moreover, this fork-blocking property was shown to be independent
of transcription as it occurred even in RNA polymerase 1 knockout
strains, thereby reasserting that RFB activity is sequence-specific.
To understand the mechanism by which fork blocking occurs in this
eukaryotic system, we have undertaken a thorough in-depth study of
the DNA recognition element responsible for fork stalling. A series
of prosthetic forked DNA constructs were designed, with the fork progressing
to different extents as well as progressing from different directions
within the RFB (ter) sequence (Figures S2 and S3). The directions of the approaching
fork have been termed “permissible” or “nonpermissible”
depending on whether they are approaching from the reported passive
direction and are allowed to pass through the RFB site or arrested,
respectively. Fluorescent adenine analogue 2-aminopurine (2-AP) has
been used as a reporter of the local environment,16−20 and this probe has been incorporated site-specifically
in the prosthetic forks that were constructed. A combination of thermal
melting studies, fluorescence lifetime, and fluorescence anisotropy
decay kinetics was performed in the presence and absence of Fob1 to
aid in deciphering the mechanism of DNA recognition and polar arrest
by this protein. The results show that the Fob1 protein causes polar
arrest by preferentially interacting with the double-stranded region,
a few bases ahead of the nonpermissive directed fork by acting as
a unidirectional clamp.

Results and Discussion
Fob1 from Ashbya gossypii, a close
homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used as a model system to establish the mechanism of polar
arrest. The Ashbya gossypii Fob1 protein
was identified from a BLAST search as a close homologue, and we believe
both fungi adopt a common mechanism of regulation. The intergenic
NTS1 region, which contains the ter sequences, is
highly conserved across fungal species. In fact, in the case of S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii, the ter1 sequence is identical. Therefore, the
choice of protein should not affect the interpretations. This Fob1
construct was used due to ease of purification, solubility, and stability
of the protein. Because this particular protein has not been characterized
earlier, to confirm its ability to bind the ter1
sequence and to gain an estimate of its binding constant under steady-state
conditions, bulk fluorescence anisotropy experiments were carried
out with the 5′-6-FAM-labeled ter sequence
(Figure 1A). Results
reveal that Fob1 is able to bind both the double-stranded and forked
sequences with similar affinity (Figure 1B) and exhibits 10-fold less affinity for
single-stranded ter. The confirmatory electrophoretic
mobility gel shift assay (EMSA) with various fork constructs in both
permissible and nonpermissible directions (Figure 1C) was instrumental in reaffirming our findings.
Armed with this information, site-specific experiments were undertaken.

Artificial forks where an adenine
analogue, 2-AP, was substituted
only at the natural adenine sites in the double-stranded region are
labeled with a postscript “D*”, and when it was substituted
at the fork, it was labeled as “F*”. A prescript of
“N” or “P” has been added for nonpermissible/permissible
directed forks, and for sequences where 2-AP was incorporated at the
fork junction, a postscript of “tD” has been used. Fluorescence
anisotropy decay kinetics data was fit satisfactorily to a sum of
two exponentials, where the local dynamics of the base in the DNA
strand was represented by the faster rotational correlation time (ϕ1), whereas the global motion of the entire DNA or the complex
was represented by the slower rotational correlation (ϕ2). Order parameter S2 (eq 6) for the probe was subsequently
calculated.21

Anomalous Behavior of 2-AP
at Forks
Free 2-AP has a
single fluorescence lifetime of 11 ns but when incorporated within
a DNA, 2-AP exhibits upto four lifetimes with the shortest lifetime
(τ1, 20–70 ps; Table 2) ascribed to base-pairing and the associated
stacking interactions between bases.22 The
longest lifetime is attributed (5–9 ns, Table 2) to an extrahelical component, and the origin
of the middle two lifetime components (0.2–0.6 and 1.5–3
ns) is presumed to represent conformations in between the completely
stacked state and extrahelical state. Because of the inability to
assign the middle two lifetime components, we prefer to use the mean
lifetime (τm) in differentiating the mode of binding
of Fob1 (see below). However, the observed variation in the mean lifetime
reflects the relative contributions of the shortest and the longest
lifetime components. Increase in the mean lifetime caused by Fob1
binding (see later) arises mainly due to increase in the value of
the shortest lifetime component and a concomitant decrease in its
amplitude, which reflect weakening of base-pairing. Thus, the change
in the value of mean lifetime could be interpreted to indicate the
change in the strength of base-pairing.

Our studies reveal a
unique observation for 2-AP at the fork positions: an enhancement
in the mean fluorescence lifetime when compared to that for the single-stranded
DNA was observed for all of the fork positions irrespective of the
direction or position of the fork within ter1 (Tables 1 and S1). This is in sharp contrast to the decrease
in the mean lifetime for 2-AP located at base-pairing locations (Table 1) on going from single-stranded
to double-stranded DNA. For example, for sequence N2F*_ss, where the
natural adenine is replaced by 2-AP at the 10th position, the enhancement
in the mean lifetime from 0.45 to 1.1 ns was observed for the same
base in the single-stranded versus forked structure, respectively
(Figure 2A,B). This
behavior at the forks is reminiscent of an earlier report of a higher
fluorescence intensity of 2-AP when presented in a fork.23,24 Because the 2-AP at the fork junction is in a constricted environment,
an enhancement in the lifetime was observed (Tables 1 and S1) for all
of the fork positions irrespective of the direction or position of
the fork. The cause of this behavior lies in the unique position that
the base is presented with: between a rigid double-stranded region
and a more flexible single-stranded region. The base is unable to
stack well with either region, leading to a lower level of quenching.
We believe that this unique change in lifetime is a signature property
of the fork and can be used in general to detect fork-like structures.

Effect of Fork Direction
on ter1
Before
proceeding to Fob1-mediated polar arrest, we wanted to test whether
in the absence of the protein the ter1 sequence inherently
possesses any property toward polar unwinding. Thermal melting profiles
of various prosthetic forks (Figure 3A,B) show that an early melting occurs for the constructs
with the fork situated in the permissible direction and a comparatively
higher melting temperature is observed for the oppositely directed
forks, clearly indicating that in these short constructs the partially
unthreaded permissible forks are easier to open than the nonpermissible
ones. A closer look at the sequence reveals that this differential
melting occurs because of the skewed distribution of the G–C
base pairs. Analyzing other RFBs reveal that Fob1-binding sequences
consistently contain this skewed distribution (Figure S4). This is particularly striking because this mode
is very different from other fork-blocking systems like the ter sequences in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. In contrast to eukaryotes, the ter sequences in prokaryotic systems show high degree of
homology and have conserved bases that serve as signature sequences.5,25

sequences; mismatch at the 5′ end represents forks directed

Fob1 Binding Causes Larger Perturbation to the Double-Stranded
Region
After analyzing the motional dynamics of various 2-AP
prosthetic forks in detail, the Fob1 protein was added to these sequences.
Information regarding differential perturbation of bases (double-stranded
vs forked region) caused by Fob1 binding was the first question that
was addressed. All experiments were performed under saturating conditions
(28 μM Fob1, see Figure 1B). This was to ensure that the Fob1–DNA complexed
state is the predominant form. The sequences were designed such that
2-AP was incorporated within the double-stranded region at positions
5, 7, and 4 from the fork (N1D*, N2D*, and N3D*, respectively; Figure 4C) or at the fork
positions itself (N1F*, N2F*, and N3F*; Figure 4C). It was observed that the fractional increase
in the mean lifetime of 2-AP on Fob1 binding (Figure 4A,D) in all of the cases exhibited a larger
change for the probe present within the double-stranded regions of
the prosthetic forks. The sensitivity of this region was also reflected
from the comparatively larger increase in dynamic restriction in the
local motion (Figure 4B), which was on an average 1.5–2-fold higher than that for
the bases present at the fork regions (Table 1, Figure 4E). Restriction in the motional freedom of 2-AP due
to protein binding is also evident from the decrease in the amplitude
associated with the faster correlation time (Figure 4E, Table S2).

in the mean lifetime and order parameter, respectively, in the presence

and in red at the fork junctions.

It should be pointed out that the change in motional dynamics
(ΔS2) is a more robust indicator
of the extent
of perturbation caused by Fob1 binding when compared with the fractional
increase in the mean lifetime because the mean lifetime is sensitive
to DNA architecture. Furthermore, if the extents of perturbation of
the double-stranded and fork regions are very similar, we should have
seen a larger value of ΔS2 for the
fork sites when compared to that for the double-stranded region, contrary
to the observations (Figure 4E). This is because the bases at the fork positions are relatively
less stacked and therefore Fob1 binding at this position should have
resulted in greater restriction. However, because the results indicate
that Fob1 binding consistently perturbs the double-stranded region
more significantly as compared with the fork positions, we can conclude
that Fob1 binds preferentially to this architecture. Moreover, it
was noted that the increase in the mean fluorescence lifetime of 2-AP
on going from ds-DNA to ds-DNA–Fob1 complex arises mainly from
a decrease in the amplitude of the shortest lifetime and a concomitant
increase in the amplitude of the longest lifetime (Table 2). As mentioned earlier, the decrease in the amplitude of
the shortest lifetime is an indication of Fob1-binding-caused weakening
of the stacking interaction of 2-AP with the neighboring base (Table 1). The longest lifetime
component of ds-DNA does not change significantly on binding to the
protein. However, the amplitude of the longest component increases
on protein binding; this is due to the perturbation caused by protein
binding, resulting in an increase in the population of the extrahelical
component, a consequence of partial opening of the helix. From the
above observations, it is clear that Fob1 latches ahead of the fork
position within the double-stranded region of the construct.

Polarity of Fob1 Binding to DNA
The experiments performed
above clearly demonstrated that Fob1 binding perturbs the double-stranded
DNA architecture over fork junction positions. The next question asked
is whether Fob1 shows any preference for forks arriving from the opposite
directions. This question is the central theme of this work. Two sets
of constructs were designed (Figure 5A,B) such that 2-AP’s were positioned in the
base-paired region with the fork approaching from the nonpermissible
(N1D*, N2D*, N3D*, and NtD*) or the permissible end (P4D*, P1D*, and
PtD*). A comparison of the fractional change in the mean lifetime
(Figure 5C) showed
that the base-paired positions in constructs with forks progressing
from the nonpermissible direction face a greater perturbation as compared
to that for those from the permissible direction. In some cases, the
difference in lifetime between the permissible versus nonpermissible-directed
forks is greater than 4-fold. A greater change in the order parameter
was also observed for 2-AP in the nonpermissible forks compared to
that in the permissible forks (Figure 5D). This difference is likely caused by the larger
extent of perturbation to base stacking, as well as the reduction
in the space available for local motion of the base, for the forks
in the nonpermissible direction. The enhanced changes for the nonpermissible-directed
forks indicate a stronger interaction of the DNA–protein complex
for these constructs, thereby resulting in slower dissociation of
the complex. It is worth noting that for creating a polar block the
difference in the rate of dissociation of the Fob1–DNA complex
rather than the difference in binding affinity is more relevant. This
has been observed earlier where surface plasmon resonance studies
on the polarity of termination of replication in the E. coli Tus-Ter system revealed
the importance of the dissociation rate in explaining the mechanism
of polarity difference.5 Therefore, the
above observations assert that Fob1 perceives the directionality of
the forks and that there exists an asymmetric mode of binding of Fob1
to DNA. The protein possibly differentiates between the permissible
and nonpermissible directions of ter1 and binds such
that the two ends of ter1 interact and perceive a
different face of the protein. Because of its differential mode of
binding of oppositely directed forks, the protein would provide an
easier route for the passage of a fork progressing from the permissive
direction, whereas impede the progress on the nonpermissive side,
leading to polar stalling of replication forks.

respectively, in the presence of Fob1. The bar graphs in blue and
green represent 2-AP in base-paired regions of nonpermissible and
permissible forks, respectively.

To confirm that the preferential perturbation effects of
Fob1 are
not due to local 2-AP position but solely due to directionality, fork
constructs where the position of 2-AP in the double-stranded or fork
sequence remains constant but the direction of the forks is different
were made (Figure 6A, Table 1). Interaction
of Fob1 with these different DNA architectures, in terms of both the
fluorescence dynamic parameters, reveals that Fob1-binding-caused
perturbation follows the order N1D* > P1D* > N2F* > P5F*
(Figure 6B,C). Thus,
the protein
distinguishes between the constructs and, as established before, Fob1
favors the double-stranded region of a construct with forks directed
from the nonpermissible end over the permissible directed forks. Overall,
it can be inferred from here that the nature of protein binding is
related to not only the sequence but also the DNA architecture that
is being presented to it.

end is not influenced
by local 2-AP position. (A) Cartoon representation of forks demonstrating

mean lifetime and order parameter, respectively, in the presence of

forks at fork junctions and in blue and green at the base-paired position.

Fob1 Polarity Is Sequence-Specific
Finally, to ascertain
the specificity of the results seen with the prosthetic forks in ter1, two random constructs created with forks on opposite
sides were studied as control sequences (Figure S5A, Ct1_ds and Ct2_ds). The control sequence was designed
such that the position of 2-AP remains constant and after annealing
with partially complementary sequences, the pair of oppositely directed
forks generated possess equal number of G–C base pairs in the
double-stranded region. The fluorescence dynamic parameters (Tables 2 and S2) show very similar binding properties, with
the differences being indistinguishable (Figure S5B,C). The results reveal the absence of any preferential
extent of perturbation by Fob1 to the two control sequences. The observations
clearly indicate that the binding prejudices that we observe for the
oppositely directed forked constructs of ter1 are
caused by specific interactions of Fob1 with this sequence.

Insights
into the Mechanism of Polar Arrest by Fob1
In this work,
the aim was to investigate if Fob1 can sense a polar
block in a standalone setting or does it require a host of other proteins
to exert this effect. By employing 2-AP, a highly environmentally
sensitive site-specific fluorescence probe, into a series of artificial
DNA forked structures, it was established that Fob1 can indeed create
a unidirectional block. This strategy of incorporation of 2-AP into
replication forks has been successfully employed earlier to identify
the DNA breathing events at the fork junctions as well as the GTP-dependent
helicase activity-dependent interaction of primosome at the replication
fork.23,24 Corroborating thermal melting studies showed
that the choice of RFB as a blocking sequence is not arbitrary, rather
a specific arrangement of bases termed as “sequence effect”,
which is possibly one of the contributors to the fork polarity. This
effect is magnified by the presence of Fob1, which possesses the ability
of sensing differentially directed forks. Fob1 acts like a clamp,
few base pairs ahead of the fork, and via preferential interaction
with the double-stranded region at the nonpermissible end acts like
a polar barrier. Reasoning from the converse behavior it manifests
on the DNA unthreading from opposite directions, it is likely that
Fob1 binds DNA in an asymmetric manner, posing different faces on
either end of the sequence. During replication, the progress of a
fork toward a particular base tends to cause a decrease in the stacking
interactions that is sensed by Fob1. On perceiving the direction of
approaching fork, Fob1 accordingly alters its mode of binding, enhancing
its hold on the sequence for a fork approaching from the nonpermissible
direction, whereas allowing progression of the fork from the permissible
side and thus bringing about polarity. The larger restriction in the
nonpermissible direction would necessitate a larger force to remove
the protein, resulting in slower dissociation of the complex in this
orientation for fork progress. As mentioned above, in this scenario,
the difference in the rate of dissociation of the Fob1–DNA
complex rather than the difference in the binding affinity is the
dominant controlling factor for polarity-based mechanisms in DNA–protein
interactions, as noted in earlier studies.5 In an in vivo setting, we believe that Fob1 possibly strengthens
this barrier in consort with other proteins. The event can be multistep
where Fob1 first forms a terminator complex at the RFB site and then
recruits the other members. The biophysical analysis of the Fob1-RFB
system, along with the use of 2-AP, provides a precise site-specific
resolution in studies pertaining to these events. We believe that
the site-specific fluorescence dynamics is an invaluable tool used
here to obtain insights into the binding footprints of proteins on
their cognate sequences, in greater detail.

Materials and
Methods
Cloning and Protein Purifications
Due to problems of
low expression of the Fob1 protein from S. cerevisiae, studies with the homologous Fob1 system of Ashbya
gossypii were initiated. For the experiments, Fob1
(1–450 residues) that comprises the DNA binding region was
cloned in a modified pET vector, with an N-terminal hexahistidine
tag. Plasmids were transformed in Rosetta cells and grown in Luria
Bertani broth with antibiotics chloramphenicol and kanamycin at concentrations
30 and 35 μg/mL, respectively, at 37 °C and 250 rpm. Protein
expression was induced with IPTG (isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside)
at 0.8 mM concentration. The induced cells were grown for about 6
h at 25 °C and harvested. The cells were resuspended in buffer
A (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) and homogenized
by sonication. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 20 000
rpm and 4 °C, the supernatant was added to Ni-NTA beads (GE Healthcare,
WI) that had been equilibrated in buffer A. The beads were subsequently
separated by centrifugation and mounted on a column, followed by a
slow wash with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 15 mM
imidazole). The protein was eluted with the buffer containing imidazole
at 200 mM (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole). The
eluted protein was desalted using desalting columns (Econo-Pac10DG
columns, Bio-Rad) into a buffer containing 35 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 250
mM NaCl, 3% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT and used for the fluorescence studies.

DNA Synthesis and Annealing
Modified (Table 1 and Figures S2 and S3) and unmodified DNA sequences were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies. The oligonucleotides were quantified
by employing a spectrophotometer (GE, GeneQuant 1300, WI) at 260 nm.
The complementary strands of the modified (2-AP incorporated) DNA
were taken in 20% excess, so as to ensure complete annealing of the
latter. For the unmodified constructs, the complementary strands were
taken in an equimolar ratio. The DNA sequences were annealed in the
presence of 1× annealing buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mM NaCl).
The mixture was subjected to a temperature of 95 °C for 5 min
by placing in a water bath, which was then allowed to cool slowly
to room temperature. The samples were stored at −20 °C.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)
The oligonucleotides
were labeled with radioactive 32P as the phosphate group
at the 5′ end of the DNA. Approximately, 1 nmol of the labeled
oligonucleotide was incubated with the protein (purified in 35 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 3% glycerol) concentrations ranging from
4.2 μM to 65 nM obtained by 2-fold serial dilution in a total
of 10 μL of reaction mixture. The incubation mixture also contained
10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mM KCl, 1.8 mM DTT, 2 μg/mL
hemoglobin, and 7.4% glycerol. After 30 min of incubation at 25 °C,
the samples were run in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with
TBE as the running buffer (89 mM Tris-base, pH 8.3, 89 mM boric acid,
2 mM EDTA) at 100 V and 4 °C. Gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging
using Storm 625 (GE healthcare) and software ImageQuant (GE).

Thermal
Melting of DNA
DNA thermal melting studies
were carried out in a Varian Cary 100 Bio UV–visible spectrophotometer.
DNA was taken at ∼2 μM concentration in a buffer containing
20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. The absorbance
of the samples was monitored at 260 nm wavelength as the temperature
was raised from 20 to 95 °C at the rate of 1 °C/min.

Time-Resolved
Fluorescence
The time-resolved fluorescence
decay and anisotropy decay measurements were performed with a Rhodamine
6G dye laser that generates pulses of 1 ps width.18,22,26,27 The dye laser
was driven by a passively mode-locked frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser
(Vanguard, Spectra Physics). The samples were excited with the second-harmonic
output of the angle-tuned KDP crystal (310 nm). The curves for fluorescence
decay were obtained from a time-correlated single-photon counting
setup coupled to a microchannel plate photomultiplier (model 2809U,
Hamamatsu Corp.). The instrument response function (IRF) was obtained
at 310 nm from a very dilute colloidal suspension of dried nondairy
coffee whitener. The IRF half-width was ∼40 ps. The fluorescence
emission of the samples was collected through a 345 nm cut-off filter
followed by a monochromator at 370 nm with a collection bandwidth
of 3 nm. The number of counts in the peak channel was ∼10 000.
The fluorescence emission for obtaining the lifetime was monitored
at 54.7° (magic angle) to avoid contribution from anisotropy
decay. The emission in directions parallel and perpendicular to that
of the incident polarized light was collected for the time-resolved
anisotropy measurements.

The samples consisted of 7 μM
oligonucleotides, with and without the protein at 28 μM concentration.
The complex was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before data
collection. The buffer consisted of 35 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl,
3% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT.

Data Analysis
Analysis of Fluorescence
Decay Kinetics
Analysis of
the fluorescence decay for the lifetime measurements was performed
using a nonlinear least-squares iterative deconvolution method based
on the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm and expressed as a sum
of exponentials with the following equation 1  where αi is the
amplitude of the ith component associated
with fluorescence lifetime τi such
that ∑αi = 1. The mean lifetime,
τm, of the system is obtained from ∑αiτi.

Analysis
of Fluorescence Anisotropy Decay Kinetics
The time-resolved
anisotropy decay curves were derived from experimentally
obtained I∥(t)
and I⊥(t) with
the following equation 2  where r(t) is the time-dependent anisotropy, G(λ)
is
the geometry factor at the wavelength of emission, λ, and I∥(t) and I⊥(t) are the fluorescence intensities
collected with the emission polarizer at 0° (parallel) and 90°
(perpendicular) with respect to excitation, respectively. The value
of G(λ) for the optics for measuring emission
was calculated independently using 50 μM solution of 2-AP.

The fluorescence anisotropy decay analysis was performed by globally
fitting I∥(t)
and I⊥(t) as 3   4   5  where r0 is the
anisotropy in the absence of any rotational diffusion and βi is the amplitude associated with the ith rotational correlation times ϕi, such that ∑βi =
1. ϕ1 represents the local motion of the fluorophore,
and ϕ2 represents the global motion of DNA or the
DNA–Fob1 complex. The model assumes that the sample contains
a population having uniform motional dynamics properties with each
species associated with two rotational correlation times. The r0 value was estimated to be 0.31 in a separate
experiment with a sample in 70% glycerol. For the analysis of anisotropy
decays, the r0 value of 0.31 with a window
of 0.01 was used. Anisotropy parameters ϕi and βi were estimated
by analyzing, globally, I∥(t) and I⊥(t) using eqs 3 and 4 by fixing r0 (as mentioned
above) and intensity decay parameters estimated by analyzing the decay
obtained at the magic angle by eq 1. This procedure enabled us to reduce the number of
free parameters in eqs 3 and 4 and thereby enhanced the robustness
of the recovery of anisotropy decay parameters. Errors in the recovered
parameters were estimated from a combination of several decay profiles
from a sample and multiple samples. All of the decay curves were analyzed
independently to obtain stable fits with χ2 values
close to unity and random distribution of residuals.

The extent
of restriction of 2-AP motion was estimated from generalized
order parameter S2 given by the following
equation21,28,29 6  To compare the changes in
the mean lifetime
of 2-AP in the constructs, caused by Fob1 binding, the fractional
increase in the mean lifetime was assessed by the following formula 7  The Fob1-binding-induced
changes in the spatial
restriction to the local motion of 2-AP in DNA constructs were analyzed
by 8
