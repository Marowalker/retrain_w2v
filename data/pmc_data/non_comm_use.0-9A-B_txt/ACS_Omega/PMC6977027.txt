Slow-release fertilizers (SRFs) have been widely used
to reduce
environment pollution derived from excessive nutrients. Coated fertilizers
have been designed and prepared using various materials. However,
development of new green coating materials and simple process is still
a huge challenge. In this study, tannic acid (TA), a natural polyphenol,
was used to prepare poly(tannic acid) (PTA)-coated fertilizers with
urea prills as the core, and the technology of the coating process
in a spout fluidized bed was developed. PTA coating could be formed
rapidly by the fast oxidation of TA by an oxidation solution containing
CuSO4 and H2O2. The coated urea release
behavior was systematically studied in water and soil. In both water
and soil, the release rate of nitrogen from coated urea is much slower
than that from raw urea. Raw urea was completely dissolved within
30 min, while 27% of urea was released from coated urea. The pot experiments
indicated that coated urea has a positive effect on the plant growth
as well. Our results provide an effective method to prepare environment-friendly
SRFs, indicating a promising application in sustainable agriculture.

==== Body
Introduction
Rapid population growth has made food
shortages severe, and global
food demand is expected to double by 2050.1 Fertilizers have been used as crucial agrochemicals to supply plant
nutrients, which play a pivotal role in maintaining food production
sufficiently for the continuously growing population of the world.
It has been reported that ∼70% of the nutrients of plant growth
come from fertilizers.2 However, overuse
of fertilizers has caused many serious environmental problems that
have been a widespread concern, such as water, air, and soil pollution.3−5 For example, urea is widely used as a nitrogenous fertilizer. It
is highly soluble in water, but the rapid and excessive release of
nitrogen is harmful to plants. It may be converted to ammonia by an
enzyme or microorganism, leading to easier volatilization and leaching
to the natural environment. Therefore, a slow-release fertilizer (SRF)
has been designed and developed to mitigate fertilizer pollution and
to avoid plants from suffering damage from fast nutrient release.6−8

Compared with traditional fertilizers, SRFs have many advantages
such as improving fertilizer utilization efficiency,9,10 reducing the frequency of fertilization,11 and alleviating the potential impact on the environment.12−14 Coated fertilizers are among the most developed SRFs. Generally,
they are prepared by coating leakproof materials such as inorganic,
synthetic, or natural polymers on a nutrient core.10 The nondegradability and nonrenewability of synthetic polymers
are always accompanied with environmental pollution and additional
manufacturing costs, which have limited the widespread application
of SRFs. Biocompounds such as cellulose,15 starch,16 chitosan,17 and some superabsorbents10,18−20 have been widely used in SRFs due to their renewability and biodegradability.21 However, the coating materials with green, natural,
and low-cost properties still have a big room for improvement. More
recently, inspired by mussel adhesion, dopamine and catecholamines
have been used for surface modification and functionalization of versatile
materials. In our previous study, polydopamine (PDA) is a potential
candidate to make coated SRFs,22−25 but it is expensive and does not meet the industrial
utilization purpose and sustainable development. Tannic acid (TA),
a type of commercial polyphenol, is usually extracted from plants,
such as Tara pods, gallnuts, and Sicilian Sumac leaves. It has a similar
adhesion property and forms a poly(tannic acid) (PTA) coating, which
could be a substitute for PDA as a coating material of SRFs.

Various methods have been applied to prepare coated fertilizers,
such as rotary drum, rotary turntable, and fluidized bed.26 The rotary drum and rotary turntable technologies
have been widely used, but they have shortcomings. They require a
large quantity of coating materials, generate local humidity, form
holes, and collapse in the coating, leading to a rough coating with
low repeatability and poor fertilizer efficiency.27 The fluidized bed can form a uniform coating by using melt
or liquid coating materials, which can be controlled by adjusting
coating conditions including coating cycles, temperature, and spraying
rate.28,29 However, there are no reports on PTA-coated
fertilizers made by a spout fluidized bed, which provides an economic
and efficient method for the preparation of promising coated SRFs.

In this study, the oxidation rates of TA by various oxidation solutions
were studied by UV–vis spectroscopy. PTA coating was formed
on four different substrates by spraying technology to investigate
the forming mechanism of PTA coating, which was analyzed by FT-IR,
static water contact angles, and EDX. The morphology of the PTA coating
was investigated by SEM and AFM. Urea, the most widely used nitrogen
fertilizer, was used as a starting material to prepare the coated
fertilizer by a single spout fluidized bed using optimized PTA formation
conditions. Compared with industrial urea prills, the coated urea
release rate was slower in water and soil. The release behavior of
coated urea was evaluated by the pot experiment. Such results provide
a promising methodology to prepare coated fertilizers and shine light
on the development of new SRFs.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Urea prills (⌀ 1.18–3.35 mm,
46.4% N) were purchased from Xinlianxin Energy and Chemical Co., Ltd.
(Xinjiang, China). Tannic acid (TA, 99%) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich
(Shanghai, China). Anhydrous cupric sulfate (CuSO4) was
purchased from Shengao Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was purchased from
Yongsheng Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Sodium periodate
(NaIO4) was purchased from Kelong Chemical Reagent Factory
(Chengdu, China). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was purchased from Shanghai
Titan Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Glass, polyurethane
(PU), polycarbonate (PC), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), and silicon
rubber (Si-rubber) were received from Shenzhen Jinhongsheng Material
Co. Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). Deionized water was used throughout the
experiment. All other chemicals were analytical-grade and used as
received.

Characterization
The absorbance change of the TA solutions
at λ = 350 nm was recorded by a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(UV-3200PCS, MeiPuDa Company, Shanghai, China). The contact angle
of the substrate was tested by a water contact angle tester (DSA100,
Kruss, Germany). The morphology of PTA coating deposited on the PC
substrate was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-6490LV,
Japan Electronics Co. Ltd.). The compositions of coating were analyzed
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet iS10, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra, and
elemental mapping (SEM with EDS detector). Atomic force microscopy
(AFM, MultiMode 8, Bruker, Germany) was used to test the flatness
and uniformity of coating. The thickness of the layers on the substrates
was measured with an ellipsometer (L116s, Gaertner Scientific Corporation,
USA).

PTA Coating Formation by Spraying Technology
The plane
substrates were cut into 2 × 2 cm, washed with Milli-Q, sonicated
in ethanol for 30 min, and then dried at room temperature. Then the
substrates were prepared and fixed on an iron stand. The TA, NaIO4, and CuSO4 + H2O2 solutions
were prepared freshly with DI water. TA and oxidation solutions were
placed in an atomizer device in equal amounts. The angle and the distance
between the atomizer nozzle and the substrate were fixed at 90°
and 20 cm, respectively. Each spraying lasted for 5 s, which may be
repeated to obtain suitable coating thickness. The substrates were
washed with DI water and dried under a stream of air.

Preparation of PTA-Coated Urea
TA (15 or 25 mg/mL),
PVA (1 mg/mL), and oxidation (CuSO4 + H2O2) solutions were prepared freshly. Then the PTA-coated urea
granules were prepared by a single spout fluidized bed (WBF-2G, Chongqing
Aibote Electromechanical Co. Ltd. China). The process parameters are
as follows: the temperature was 45–50 °C, spray rate was
2–10 rpm/min, atomization pressure was 1.8–2.0 MPa,
and the coating was ∼20 g per 500 g of raw urea granules. The
PTA-coated SRFs were dried at 54–60 °C for 10 min in the
spout fluidized bed.

Release Property of PTA-Coated Urea in Water
1 g of
SRF was enclosed in a dialysis bag (MWCO = 100), placed in a conical
bottle with 200 mL of DI water (pH = 6.8 ± 0.2), and incubated
at 25 ± 0.5 °C in an oscillator (100 rpm/min, ZHEY-100D,
Shanghai Zhicheng Analytical Instrument Manufacturing Co., Ltd., China).
2 mL of the solution was withdrawn at certain time periods, and 2
mL of fresh medium was added to maintain a constant volume of solvent.
The release of coated urea was evaluated by the para-dimethylamino-benzaldehyde colorimetric method.30 Each sample has three parallel experiments.

Release Property of PTA-Coated Urea in Soil
A 300 mesh
sieve was placed at the bottom of a PVC pipe having a diameter of
5 cm and a height of 30 cm. 15 cm (275 g) of soil was filled, then
2 g of fertilizer was added dispersedly, and 5 cm (125 g) of soil
was covered to the top. A 250 mL container was attached to the bottom
of the PVC tube. Initially, the soil was wet with a certain amount
of water, and then 50 mL of water was added for a leaching cycle,
which may be repeated until the urea was released completely. The
released urea was measured with the Kjeldahl method by Kjeldahl apparatus
(Foss 2300, Foss Tecator AB, Denmark). All the experiments were carried
out in triplicate.

Results and Discussion
Oxidation Kinetics of TA in Solution
It is found that
the phenolic derivatives could be oxidized by different oxidation
solutions, such as Tris–HCl (pH = 8.5), H2O2, CuSO4, and NaIO4. First, the oxidation
process of TA in various oxidation solutions was monitored by UV–vis
spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 1. The increase of absorbance at around λ = 350
nm is attributed to the oxidation of phenolic hydroxyl of tannin to
quinone31 (Figure S1). Similar results have been reported on the oxidation of dopamine.32 Among these results, the solution contains both
CuSO4 and H2O2 and shows the fastest
oxidation rate and the greatest absorbance increase at around λ
= 350 nm, indicating the fastest TA oxidation. Such a phenomenon may
be ascribed to a large number of active oxidants (O2– and HO2·) by using CuSO4 and H2O2.33 The
concentrations of CuSO4 and H2O2 were
optimized, as shown in Figure 1B,C. The optimum concentrations for CuSO4 and H2O2 are 17.8 and 19.6 mM, respectively. The solution
contains NaIO4 and shows the second-fastest oxidation rate,
which is optimized and selected as a comparison condition for further
testing.

solutions, their corresponding photographs, and a certain amount of

PTA Coating on the Planar Substrate by Spraying Technology
PTA is a potential coating material to prepare SRF. It has been
reported that catechol derivatives are easily deposited on the substrates
by the dipping method.34,35 However, it requires a longer
time (480 min), while the thickness of the coating is hard to control.
In addition, urea, which is soluble in water, cannot be coated with
PTA by dipping in aqueous solution. Spraying is an alternative method
for PTA coating, as shown in Scheme 1. A solution containing TA was mixed with oxidation
solution during spraying, which was sprayed on the substrate through
a spraying gun with airflow. Such a process may be repeated until
the desired thickness was achieved. Uncoated materials can be removed
by rinsing at a predetermined time. After drying by vacuum, substrates
with PTA coating were obtained, which was used for further studies.
In this study, four kinds of substrates including PTFE, PU, PC, and
glass were selected with different hydrophilicity.

Scheme 1 Deposition of PTA
on the Substrate by Spraying Technology
PTA coating can be easily and rapidly deposited
on substrates by
the spraying method, resulting in the surface color to turn into brownish,
which are exhibited by digital photographs in Figure 2A. This color change indicates the formation
of PTA coating. Figure 2B shows the FT-IR spectrum of PTA coating. The peaks at 3415, 1720,
and 1617 cm–1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations
of the phloroglucin of TA, C=O, and C=C of quinone formed by tannic
acid oxidation, respectively. PTA coatings are able to efficiently
induce the reduction of Ag+ and form Ag nanoparticles,
leading to the color of the substrates to become blackish (Figure S2). This phenomenon is attributable to
the reduction of PTA, indicating that the PTA was successfully coated
on the surface of the substrates. After PTA deposition, the surface
hydrophilicity may be different and caused a change of water contact
angle. The difference in the water contact angle (Figure 2C) indicates that the interface
becomes more hydrophilic. The thicknesses of the PTA on PC and silica
substrates are 1511 and 516 nm for NaIO4 and 1309 and 547
nm for CuSO4 + H2O2 (Figure 2D), respectively.

Figure 2 (A) Digital
photographs, (B) FT-IR spectra, (C) static water contact
angles, and (D) thickness analysis of PTA on various substrates.

SEM was employed to investigate PTA morphology
on the PC substrate,
which is presented in Figure 3. The plain PC substrate was used as a control group. A rough
surface with globular sediments was formed on the PC after treatment
with NaIO4, while a smoother coating when using CuSO4 + H2O2 was formed. PTA coating on the
substrates may induce Ag formation. After treatment with silver nitrate
(AgNO3) solution, a large amount of Ag particles was found
on the PC surface (Figure S3), indicating
the successful PTA deposition. Ag was dispersed uniformly on PTA,
as shown in the mapping analysis (Figure S3). EDX shows similar results that C, O, and Ag elements are present
evenly on the coating. Besides, I and Cu were found by EDX in the
coating deposited on the PC by NaIO4 and CuSO4 + H2O2, respectively. AFM and ellipsometry
were used to measure the roughness (Figure 3) and thickness (Figure 2D and Figure S4) of PTA coating, which was consistent with SEM results. The average
surface roughness (Rq) increases from
0.903 (plain PC) to hundreds of nanometers for these coatings deposited
by NaIO4 and CuSO4 + H2O2 spraying, respectively. The coating prepared by CuSO4 + H2O2 shows a better uniformity, which may
be attributed to the rapid polymerization of TA and the fast homogenous
nucleation of PTA. The stability of PTA coating on the PC substrate
surface was tested by treatment with strong base, acid, and acetone
(Figure S5). The coating is more stable
in acid and organic solvent than that in base. After 2 h of immersion,
2 mL of solution was withdrawn and diluted three times, and then its
absorbance was recorded (Figure S5). In
the same condition, the elution solution of PTA coating prepared by
CuSO4 + H2O2 spraying shows a lower
absorbance, indicating less PTA leakage. This spraying process simulates
spraying technology of the single spout fluidized bed. Therefore,
PTA-coated SRF was prepared by using CuSO4 + H2O2 as an oxidation solution in a spout fluidized bed.

and mapping (right) of PTA coating on PC substrates.

Preparation of PTA-Coated Urea in the Spout Fluidized Bed
As shown in Scheme 2, the urea granules were suspended in hot airflow, which were coated
by atomized droplets containing TA and oxidases in the spout fluidized
bed. Coating thickness can be controlled by spraying times and cycles,
while solvent evaporation can be used to control urea agglomeration.
PTA-coated urea (PTA@urea) was successfully prepared by using CuSO4 + H2O2 to oxidize TA (Figure S6). The PTA@urea has a black coating, which is consistent
with the results of PTA coating on the flat substrates. SEM was used
to examine the surface and cross-sectional morphology of PTA coating
on urea (Figure 4).
The urea particle has a rough and irregular surface (Figure 4A,D). As shown in Figure 4B, PTA@urea a good
core–shell structure where the urea prills were coated with
PTA (Figure 4B). The
PTA coating has a smoother surface (Figure 4E) in which thickness is 50 ± 5 μm
(three spraying cycles, Figure 4B inset). However, some cracks and holes were found on the
PTA coating. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a water-soluble synthetic
polymer, has been widely used in a variety of coatings due to its
excellent film-forming, emulsifying, and adhesive properties.36 PVA was used as an additive during the preparation
of coated urea, which was defined as PVA + PTA@urea. The SEM image
of PVA + PTA@urea (Figure 4C,F) is similar to PTA@urea, which presents that the PTA layer
was well coated on urea particles. Interestingly, there are no pores
and cracks on the PVA + PTA coating (Figure 4F). The PVA may serve as a cross-linking
site during the PTA formation by the oxidation of CuSO4 + H2O2.

PVA + PTA@urea, and surfaces of (D) urea, (E) PTA@urea, and (F) PVA
+ PTA@urea; insets are the high-magnification images of fracture surfaces
of the corresponding SRFs.

Bed
Release Behavior of PTA-Coated Urea
The release property
is the most important parameter for coated urea. Urea release from
PTA@urea and PVA + PTA@urea in water and soil is shown in Figure 5. Urea was quickly
dissolved in water and almost completely released within 30 min. However,
32% urea was released from PTA@urea and 27% from PVA + PTA@urea at
the same predetermined time (Figure 5A). This result is in agreement with SEM studies. The
defect of PTA coating may cause a faster release, while a denser coating
made by PVA and PTA may slow the urea release rate. Urea could be
released completely from PTA@urea and PVA + PTA@urea within 240 and
420 min, respectively. Urea formed SFRs in soil shows similar results
(Figure 5B), which
indicated that the urea is released slower from PVA + PTA@urea than
that from PTA@urea.

and

Pot Experimental Analysis
Pot experiments were conducted
for the effectiveness of coated urea on plant growth. The digital
photos show the 30 days’ growth of the cotton plant (Figure 6). Compared with
control and plant growth with urea, the plant grew faster with coated
urea. Details are listed in Table 1. The plant fertilized with PVA + PTA@urea has shown
better parameters than those with water and urea. The improvement
of cotton production may be attributed to the following reasons. First,
urea is released from coated urea in a slow and sustained manner,
which has a positive effect on the growth of the cotton plant. Second,
PTA may induce nitrogen fixation,32 promoting
and accelerating plant growth. Finally, the biodegradable coating
may be used as a carbon source for beneficial bacteria and microbes
to enhance soil respiration.

Conclusions
In this work, PTA-coated urea was developed
as a kind of environment-friendly
SRF using a spout fluidized bed. In planar substrate PTA coating studies,
PTA was rapidly formed on various substrates using a simple spraying
technology by mixing of TA and oxidation solutions. PTA prepared by
the oxidation of CuSO4 and H2O2 showed
a thicker and smoother coating, which was selected to prepare PTA-coated
urea. The thickness of PTA on the urea core was controlled by the
spraying cycles. The PTA-coated urea release is significantly slower
than raw urea prills. The PTA-coated urea shows a positive effect
on cotton plant growth in the pot experiments. Such environment-friendly
SRFs prepared by a spout fluidized bed with simple spraying technology
might facilitate the development of new SRFs and broaden their application
in modern green and sustainable agriculture and horticulture.
