Despite
the significant progress, C–H arylation with aryldiazonium
salts is a major challenge because of the faster rate of oxidative
addition compared to the C–H insertion, leading to a deleterious
homocoupling product. Recently, this limitation has been overcome
by merging a photoredox catalyst with transition-metal catalysts which
proceeds through a distinct single electron-transfer mechanism. However,
we have observed that the photoredox catalyst is not necessary for
the C–H arylation of aniline rather chemical reactivity can
be controlled by tuning the electronic nature of the substrate. We
report, herein, a palladium-catalyzed C–H arylation of aniline
carbamates with aryldiazonium salts under external oxidant, acid,
base free conditions at room temperature. Mechanistic studies suggest
that the present reaction proceeds through a directed electrophilic
metalation pathway which is the slowest step. However, the oxidative
addition may take place through either ionic (2e–) or radical (1e–) pathway to generate hypervalent
Pd(IV) or Pd(III) intermediate, respectively. A facile reductive elimination
from the hypervalent palladium complex furnishes the C–H arylation
product under mild conditions. The carbamate directing group is easily
removed from the product to obtain the corresponding ortho-arylated
aniline, which is a precursor for plethora of carbazole alkaloids
and other biologically active molecules. The reaction is scaled-up
to gram scale to furnish the desired product in comparable yields.
Finally, we have applied this C–H arylation methodology for
the synthesis of series of carbazole alkaloids such as clausine V,
clauszoline K, O-methoxymahanine, and O-methylmurrayamine-D.

1 Introduction
Aryldiazonium
salts are a viable surrogate to the conventional
aryl halides and oxygen-based electrophilic coupling partners.1 Although they have been used extensively in Heck–Matsuda
arylation of alkenes, they have not been explored much in C–H
arylations.2−6 This could be attributed due to the fact that oxidative addition
of metal complex to the diazonium salts is extremely facile, whereas
C–H insertion proceeds through a high energetic pathway at
a sluggish reaction rate7,8 because the differentiation
in the kinetics of deleterious side product such as homocoupling formation
becomes predominant. However, the reactivity of the catalyst could
be manipulated to obtain the selective cross-coupling product through
C–H activation. Recently, the Chang group has reported an highly
reactive iridium(III)-catalyzed C–H arylation of benzamides
with aryldiazonium salts.9 The Gooßen
group also reported an iridium(III)-catalyzed C–H arylation
of carboxylic acids.10 The Sanford group
introduced a dual catalysis concept for C–H arylation with
diazonium salts by merging photoredox and palladium catalysis which
proceeds through the radical pathway.11 Several other groups have also extended this concept to other molecular
systems.12 Although palladium and photoredox
dual catalysis has been explored, only palladium-catalyzed C–H
arylation of aniline carbamates with aryldiazonium salt is not known.
Previously, ortho C–H arylation of aniline derivatives was
reported by the Lipshutz and the Jeganmohan group with arylboronic
acids where stoichiometric metal or nonmetal oxidants were necessary.13 The Li group reported ortho-arylation of aniline
carbamates with diaryliodonium salts.14 However, expensive iodonium salts, addition of strong acid additive,
and requirement of moderate temperature are some of the limitations
of this methodology. As a part of our research program in C–H
functionalization, we have accomplished the synthesis of indoles and
indolines from aryl urea through C–H activation at room temperature.15 On the other hand, we have performed chemo-,
regio-, and stereoselective Heck–Matsuda reaction with allyl
alcohol at room temperature.16 During Heck–Matsuda
reaction, we observed that after oxidative addition to the aryldiazonium
salts, a highly electrophilic palladium species is formed which undergoes
alkene insertion rapidly.4e Keeping this
in mind, we hypothesized that the similar electrophilic palladium
may undergo a facile electrophilic C–H insertion to the electron-rich
arenes under mild conditions. We report herein a palladium-catalyzed
ortho C–H arylation of aniline carbamates with inexpensive
and readily available aryldiazonium salts at room temperature. Interestingly,
both coupling partners are derived from the inexpensive aniline derivatives
where aniline carbamate acts as a nucleophile and aryldiazonium salts
as an electrophile in this palladium catalysis (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Directed C–H Arylation with
Diazonium Salts
2 Results
and Discussion
Initially, we started optimization of the
reaction condition with
acetanilide and phenyldiazonium salts using palladium(II) acetate.
However, only a trace amount of arylation product was obtained. We
realized that the ortho-position of acetanilide may not be electron-rich
enough for electrophilic ortho-palladation. Therefore, we examined N,N-dimethyl phenyl urea as an aniline
counterpart, which is more electron-rich than acetanilide. However,
a mixture of mono- and diarylation product was obtained. Therefore,
we anticipated that because of the electron-donating nature of the N,N-dimethyl group, the ortho-position
becomes highly electron-rich for uncontrolled electrophilic palladation.
Therefore, a less electron-rich substrate could be a better substrate
for selective monoarylation. From the literature, the Li group has
demonstrated aniline carbamates as a versatile and removable directing
group for C–H arylation with expensive diaryliodonium salts.14 Thus, we decided to use this moderate electron-rich
carbamate substrate for further optimization. As hypothesized, only
monoarylation product was obtained from this aniline carbamate substrate.
Subsequently, we examined several palladium catalysts, and electrophilic
palladium(II) trifluoroacetate was found to be better than palladium(II)
acetate (entry 4 vs 11, Table 1). Other palladium(0) catalysts provided homocoupling of the
aryldiazonium salts via facile oxidative addition. Among different
solvents tested, methanol was found to be optimal for this transformation.
However, excess amount of diazonium salt was necessary because of
the deleterious homocoupling product formation from the corresponding
diazonium salts. Strikingly, we did not find any positive influence
of photoredox catalysts under the irradiation of blue light-emitting
diode (LED), green LED, or household CFL on this palladium-catalysis
condition for this substrate. Any other oxidants, acids, bases, and
so forth did not improve the yield of the reaction further. Thus,
we decided to proceed for the substrate scope under this optimized
condition.

f Homocoupling product was isolated.

A series of aniline were converted
to the corresponding methyl
carbamate and examined the C–H arylation scope. Unsubstituted
aniline carbamate provided the corresponding C–H arylation
product in moderate to good yields (3a, 3b, and 3v, Scheme 2). However, electron-rich substrates provided the ortho C–H
arylation products in excellent yields. Thus, methoxy- and methyl,
dioxymethylene, 3,4-dimethoxy, and benzyloxy-substituted aniline carbamates
reacted with a series of diazonium salts to furnish the desired monoarylation
product. Diazonium salts containing electron-donating groups such
as methoxy, methyl, tert-butyl, dimethyl groups, and so forth were
an effective coupling partner (3h, 3j, 3k, 3l, 3m, 3n, 3o, 3r, 3u, and 3w, Scheme 2). In addition, electron-withdrawing
groups such as trifluoromethyl, fluoro, or even nitro groups on diazonium
were also proved to be an effective coupling partner for this transformation
(3d, 3e, 3f, 3p, and 3q, Scheme 2). Halogens such as chloro- and bromo- on the diazonium counterpart
were compatible which is useful for further cross-coupling reactions
(3c, 3t, and 3v, Scheme 2). Although ortho-methyl-substituted
carbamate provided moderate yield (3q and 3s, Scheme 2), sterically
hindered naphthalene furnished high yield of the cross-coupling product
selectively at the ortho-position where the peri C–H bond remains
inert (3r, Scheme 2). Among all aniline carbamates examined meta-methoxy or meta-methyl carbamate were efficient
substrates presumably because of electron donation and formation of
highly nucleophilic center at the ortho-position for facile electrophilic
palladation. A similar result was also observed by the Lipshutz group
during C–H arylation of arylurea at room temperature using
the cationic palladium catalyst.13a It
was further supported by the fact that electron-withdrawing nitro-,
chloro, fluoro-substituted aniline did not furnish any product. A
combination of meta-methoxy carbamate and para-nitro-substituted
diazonium provided the corresponding diazocoupling product because
the electronic nature of the coupling partners favored diazocoupling
over the oxidative addition. Similar to methyl carbamate, ethyl carbamate
(3b, Scheme 2) also exhibited similar reactivity and provided the corresponding
products in comparable yield. However, corresponding phenyl carbamates
were found to be ineffective for this transformation. The interesting
feature of this present reaction is that the anilines lacking ortho-
or meta-substitution also provide the corresponding monoarylation
product which are prone to undergo double arylation.

3 Mechanistic Studies
The present C–H arylation
reaction at room temperature proceeds
through three key steps: (1) ortho C–H activation by the cationic
palladium(II) complex to form palladacycle; (2) oxidative addition
of the palladacycle to aryldiazonium salt; and (3) reductive elimination
to form the desired biaryl product. During optimization and substrate
scope studies, we observed that N,N-dimethylanilineurea was highly reactive to provide a mixture of
mono- and ortho-, ortho-diarylation product, whereas acetanilide furnishes
trace amount of arylation product. Ultimately, methylcarbamate of
aniline provided the ortho-selective monoarylation product. In addition,
electron-rich aniline carbamates are better substrates for C–H
arylation with respect to yield. Furthermore, electrophilic palladium(II)
trifluoroacetate is a superior catalyst than palladium(II) acetate.
However, other cationic palladium(II) complexes bearing strongly coordinating
acetonitrile ligand were found to be inferior. This could be attributed
due to the fact that although these complexes undergo facile electrophilic
palladation, subsequent oxidative addition to aryldiazonium salts,
ligand exchange, or reductive elimination steps may be inhibited by
acetonitrile which is well precedented in the literature.17 A non-coordinating anion source, that is, tetrafluoroborate,
is crucial for this reaction to occur. All of these data suggest that
the electrophilic metalation mechanism might be operative instead
of concerted metalation deprotonation. Presumably, the initial electrophilic
ortho-palladation takes place with cationic palladium(II) trifluoroacetate.
Subsequently, one equivalent tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4) is generated which helps for the persistence of highly cationic
palladium species without any external acid additive. Thereby, directed
electrophilic ortho-palladation may take place to generate the palladacycle.
Because the present arylation reaction takes place at room temperature,
it is presumed that electrophilic palladation and oxidative addition
steps are competitive. To determine the involvement of C–H
activation in the rate-determining step, we prepared a d5-aniline carbamate (d5-1a) and subjected
to the reaction conditions with equimolar quantities of aniline carbamate
(1a). From this competitive experiment, the KH/KD value was determined
as 4.2 (Scheme 3a).
Therefore, the C–H activation step is slower than oxidative
addition to aryldiazonium salts. It is further supported by the fact
that a substantial amount of homocoupling product from the corresponding
diazonium salt is formed through the faster oxidative addition. Typically,
palladium(II)-catalyzed C–H arylation proceeds through the
ionic pathway. Whereas, Sanford and others have demonstrated that
a distinct single-electron process is evoke merging of palladium(II)
and photoredox catalysts.11,12 When we performed the
standard reaction in the presence of stoichiometric amount of radical
scavengers such as TEMPO or BHT, the reaction was completely suppressed.
We have also detected the TEMPO-adduct of the corresponding diazonium
salt from gas chromatography mass spectrometry. However, these radical-scavenging
experiments are not sufficient to propose the radical pathway at this
moment and warrant further studies. In fact, recent studies revealed
that a single palladium complex can also promote two distinct 2e– and 1e– processes simultaneously.18

Scheme 3 Control Experiments
From control experiments and previous literature,11,12,13a,17 we speculate that the present C–H arylation at ambient condition
initiates through the formation of arylpalladium(II) palladacycle.
Subsequently, oxidative addition to the aryldiazonium salt may lead
to the formation of cationic palladium(III) (via 1e– process with aryl radical from the diazonium salts) or palladium(IV)
(via 2e– process) intermediate. The cationic palladium(III)
species may disproportionate to generate corresponding palladium(IV)
and palladium(II) species.18 The hypervalent
palladium(IV) species then undergo rapid reductive elimination to
provide a cross-coupling product and palladium(II) species for the
subsequent runs. Thus, no external oxidant is necessary for this process
(Scheme 4).

Reaction and Deprotection
To
demonstrate the synthetic utility of the present mild protocol,
we have performed a C–H arylation reaction in gram scale. When
carbamate 1w was subjected to the standard reaction conditions
with para-methoxyphenyldiazonium salt, the corresponding
cross-coupling product was obtained in comparable yields. Thus, the
present reaction is reproducible in higher scale and useful for industrial
process development. Further, refluxing the cross-coupling product 3w with potassium hydroxide in aqueous methanol furnished
the corresponding amine in quantitative yields(Scheme 5).

4 Application to the Synthesis of Carbazole Alkaloids
Owing to their diverse biological and photochemical properties,
numerous classical and nonclassical methods have been developed for
the synthesis of carbazole moiety.19 In
recent years, two complementary approaches for their synthesis via
C–H activation are (1) C–C bond formation to obtain
ortho-aryl aniline followed by C–N bond formation20 and (2) C–N bond formation to obtain N,N-diarylaniline followed by C–C
bond formation.21 Carbazole alkaloids isolated
from diverse natural sources exhibit an impressive array of biological
activities. Therefore, intrigued by nature, we turned our attention
to apply this mild protocol for the synthesis of carbazole alkaloids.
The present strategy for carbazole synthesis is the successive C–H
amination of the C–H arylation product. Our initial efforts
for the synthesis of carbazole directly from incipient carbamate protecting
group were in vain. Therefore, we screened several other conditions
for carbazole synthesis. Finally, we applied Miura’s condition
for carbazole synthesis through C–H amination.22 The corresponding cross-coupling product was deprotected
under alkaline condition to obtain the corresponding 2-arylaniline
in quantitative yield. Subsequently, aniline was protected with 2-picolinamide,
and the C–H amination reaction was performed under inexpensive
copper catalysis. Gratifyingly, the picolinamide-protecting group
is removed under the same reaction condition under microwave irradiation.
Finally, clausine V was synthesized from the corresponding meta-anisidine as a carbamate and para-anidine
as a diazonium counterpart in 4 steps, 54% overall yield, whereas
Dash et al. reported in 2 steps, 51% yield.21a,23 Notably, both cross-coupling partners are originated from inexpensive
anilines, which offers a practical route for carbazole alkaloid synthesis.

Subsequently, almost similar strategy was applied for the synthesis
of clauszoline K.24 The C–H arylation
between meta-anisidine carbamate and meta-toluidine diazonium salt provided the corresponding 3l in 89% yield. Subsequent deprotection–protection steps followed
by the carbazole formation step afforded excellent yields in all steps.
Finally, oxidation of the methyl group by DDQ furnished the desired
clauszoline K in 77% yield and 59% overall yield in 5 steps, whereas
Knölker et al. reported in 3 steps with 57% overall yield(Scheme 6).24c

Scheme 6 Synthesis of Clausine V and Clauszoline K
In a collaborative research
program, to evaluate anticancer properties,
we were interested to develop a scalable, concise methodology to synthesize
(±)-mahanine and related carbazole alkaloids. Originally, (−)-mahanine,
a dioxygenated and pyranocarbazole alkaloid, was isolated by Narasimhan
et al. from an edible plant leaf of Murraya koenigii in 1970, and recent studies show a prominant anticancer activity.25 Therefore, a significant attention has been
drawn for the efficient synthesis of mahanine.26

In our strategy, a substituted aniline carbamate, 3w, afforded the corresponding C–H arylation with para-methoxydiazonium salt in 75% yield. Next, the carbamate
group was
deprotected under alkaline condition to obtain the corresponding aniline
in quantitative yield. Considering the scale-up issues under microwave
irradiation, we redesigned our synthetic route for a practical synthesis
of (±)-mahanine integrating conventional and robust methodology.
In this approach, the aniline was converted to the corresponding azide
via one-pot diazotization–azidation. Refluxing the azide compound
in xylene at 140 °C afforded the corresponding carbazole via
nitrene insertion to the C–H bond in 82% yield.26a The O-benzyl group was deprotected under Pd/C,
H2 (balloon pressure) in methanol to obtain the corresponding
phenol in 90% yield. The side chromene ring was constructed under
titanium(IV) isopropoxide condition with citral to provide the desired
(±)-O-methoxymahanine in 75% yield and 37% overall
yield in 6 steps, whereas Knölker et al. reported in 5 steps
and 57% overall yield.27 However, our all
attempts to deprotect the −OMe group [BCl3 in dichloromethane
(DCM), BBr3 in DCM, trimethyliodosilane in DCM, AlCl3 in benzene reflux, AlI3 pyridine in MeCN, for
details; see the Supporting Information] were in vain because of the instability of mahanine under acidic
condition. Interestingly, under one of the demethylation conditions
with tetrabutylammonium iodide and boron trichloride, the (±)-O-methoxymahanine was converted to the O-methylmurrayamine-D in 54% yield and 7 steps, 20% overall yield
(Scheme 7).

5 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a palladium(II)-catalyzed C–H
arylation of aniline carbamates with diazonium salts from an inexpensive
aniline precursor. By the judicial choice of directing group and catalyst,
the present reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature without
any base, oxidant, silver, or photoredox catalyst to provide monoarylation
at the ortho-position selectively. The present reaction proceeds via
directed electrophilic metalation at the ortho-position to form a
palladacycle which undergoes oxidative addition to the aryldiazonium
salts. However, the mode of oxidative addition either via ionic (2e–) or radical (1e–) is not clear at
this moment and warrants further studies. The present C–H arylation
reaction is scalable, and the directing group is removed easily. The
present protocol provides a direct access to carbazole alkaloids or
their derivatives, such as clausine V, clauszoline K, O-methoxymahanine, and O-methylmurrayamine-D. We
anticipate that this practical method will find many academic and
industrial applications.

6.1 General Information
All manipulations
with air-sensitive reagents were carried out under dry nitrogen atmosphere.
Unless otherwise stated, all commercial reagents were used without
additional purification. Solvents were dried using standard methods
and distilled before use. TLC was performed on silica gel plates (Merck
silica gel 60, F254), and the spots were visualized with
UV light (254 and 365 nm) or by charring the plate dipped in KMnO4 or vanillin charring solution. 1H NMR was recorded
at 300, 400, and 600 MHz frequency, and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 75, 100, and 150 MHz frequency in the CDCl3 solvent using TMS as the internal standard. 19F NMR spectra
were recorded in the CDCl3 solvent using hexafluorobenzene
as the internal standard. Chemical shifts were measured in parts per
million (ppm) referenced to 0.0 ppm for tetramethylsilane. The following
abbreviations were used to explain multiplicities: s = singlet, d

constants, J, were reported in hertz unit. HRMS (m/z) was measured using EI and ESI techniques
(JEOL-JMS 700 and Q-Tof Micro mass spectrometer, respectively).

6.1.1 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Aniline
Carbamates
Aniline carbamates were synthesized according
to the reported procedure.14 In a 100 mL
round-bottom flask, sodium carbonate (20 mmol) was dissolved in 25
mL of water. To this homogeneous mixture, 25 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE) was added to form a biphasic mixture. In this biphasic mixture,
the corresponding aniline precursor (10 mmol) was added. To the reaction
mixture, 15 mmol methyl chloroformate was added dropwise. Then, the
reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. After reaction
completion, water was added and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 ×
50 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with 1 M HCl (2 ×
50 mL) and brine (2 × 50 mL). The organic part was dried over
Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure.
The crude reaction mixture was purified by column chromatography using
hexane ethyl acetate to yield corresponding aniline carbamate.

6.1.2 General Procedure for Aryldiazonium Tetrafluoroborates
Aniline (10 mmol) was taken in a 50 mL round-bottom flask and cooled
in an ice bath, and tetrafluoroboric acid solution (48 wt % in H2O, 3.4 mL, 26 mmol) was added at 0 °C. A precipitate
was formed which was dissolved in minimum amount of distilled water.
Sodium nitrite (0.7 g, 10 mmol) in distilled water (2 mL) was added
dropwise to the reaction mixture and allowed to stir for 0.5 h at
0 °C. Thick precipitate was formed and collected by filtration.
The precipitate was washed with diethyl ether (40 mL) three times.
The resulting precipitate was recrystallized with acetonitrile/diethyl
ether to give desired aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborate as a crystalline
solid.

6.1.3 General Procedure for Arylation of Aryl
Carbamate
Aryl carbamate (0.2 mmol) and Pd(TFA)2 (10 mol %) were taken in an oven-dried 25 mL round-bottom flask
containing a stir bar. Then, dry methanol (2 mL) was added followed
by the addition of aryl diazonium salt (2 equiv). The round-bottom
flask was purged by nitrogen, and the reaction mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 30 min. The second fraction of aryl diazonium
salt (2 equiv) was added and purged with nitrogen. The reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure. The crude mixture was purified by column chromatography
using hexane/ethyl acetate to yield the corresponding arylated product.

Effect, Scheme 3a
1 (15.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), d5-1 (15.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), and
Pd(TFA)2 (6.7 mg, 10 mol %) were taken in an oven-dried
25 mL round-bottom flask containing a stir bar. Then, dry methanol
(2 mL) was added followed by the addition of phenyl diazonium salt
(2 equiv). The round-bottom flask was purged by nitrogen, and the
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The second
fraction of phenyl diazonium salt (2 equiv) was added and purged with
nitrogen. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for
16 h. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude
was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with a gradient
of elution of pet ether and ethyl acetate to give the desired arylated
product. The product was analyzed by 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3).
