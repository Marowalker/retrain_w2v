Three random copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 were obtained
by electrochemical polymerization
of donor–acceptor–donor monomers M1, M2, and M3 with 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene moiety,
respectively, using a 1:1 molar ratio of the corresponding monomers,
to find new properties and a more effective way to control the optoelectronic
properties in conjugated system. For comparison purpose, polymers P1, P2, and P3 were prepared from
the corresponding monomer units M1–M3, respectively, by electrochemical polymerization. We also present
efficient synthesis, characterization, and comparative density functional
theory (DFT) calculations of the monomers M1–M3 and polymers P1–P3. Cyclic
voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry, and electrochromic properties
of all of the polymers P1–P3 and
copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 were carried out and a throughout comparison was made. We have shown
that electrochemical copolymerization is a powerful strategy to tune
the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, band gap, and
color of the copolymer. Thus, this finding clearly indicates that
the copolymers show significantly different optoelectronic properties
compared to their constituent polymers.

1 Introduction
Conjugated
polymers have gained significant interest due to their
potential applications in various fields like organic field-effect
transistors,1 organic light-emitting diodes,2 electrochromic devices,3 photovoltaics,4 electronic displays,
supercapacitors, thermoelectric devices,5 etc. over the past decades.6,7 Conjugated polymers
based on donor–acceptor–donor (DAD) backbone are great
exploration as organic semiconductors because they offer tailoring
optoelectronic properties by changing the donor and acceptor units.
By the appropriate selection of donor and acceptor units, a large
variety of electron-rich and electron-deficient polymers can be generated
for the stabilization of electron and hole with fine tuning of band
gap and energy levels according to requirement.

The optoelectronic
properties of DAD polymer can be further effectively
tuned by copolymerization of DAD monomer with other building blocks.
Recently, copolymers have attracted significant interest due to their
tunable physical and chemical properties, namely, band gap, highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO), optical absorption, morphology, solubility, stability, etc.8 It is also noted that nowadays a large variety
of donor and acceptor units are available for tuning the optoelectronic
properties.9 Among them, thiophene (Th),
benzothiadiazole (BTZ), and their derivatives have been the most used
chromophores for the synthesis of DAD conjugated polymer. In fact,
3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and its polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOT) are the most successful building block and conjugate polymer,
respectively, used in optoelectronic applications.10,11

Development of copolymer not only leads to new materials but
also
creates interesting new properties. Indeed, the copolymers are significantly
different in chemical and physical properties compared to constituting
DAD polymer and homopolymer. Generally, DAD conjugated polymer has
been prepared from the corresponding DAD monomer by both chemical
and electrochemical polymerizations, whereas copolymer was obtained
using two or more different comonomers or monomer units. It is noteworthy
to mention that electrochemical polymerization has always offered
resulting polymers with better and controlled properties like purity,
least chemical defects, improved electrical conductivity, etc. It
may be mentioned here that the advantage of electrochemical polymerization
is that the longer monomer unit requires less number of C–C
bond formation to obtain critical polymer length than the shorter
monomer unit.12 Therefore, the resulting
polymer from the longer monomer unit has minimum chemical defects
due to less number of unnecessary couplings.

Apart from chemical
and other copolymerization methods,13 several
studies have been reported for electrochemical
copolymerization of EDOT moiety with various units such as thiophene,14,15 EDOT–methanol,16 bithiophene,17 pyrrole,18−20 aniline,21 indole,22,23 carbazole,24 thieno[3,4-b]thiophene,25 thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine,26 etc.27 For example, Ludwigs and co-workers reported
a three-dimensional randomly branched copolymer from EDOT and thiophene
units by electrochemical polymerization, followed by optoelectronic
properties discussion.14 Saavedra et al.
reported electrochemical copolymerization of EDOT with an EDOT–methanol
monomer.16 Estrany and co-workers synthesized
the copolymers obtained from N-methyl pyrrole and
EDOT using various concentration ratios and finally studied the electric
and electronic properties.18 Sotzing and
co-workers reported electrochemical copolymerization of EDOT and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene in different conditions and studied the stability
and doping level.25 Recently, Zhang and
co-workers have reported a cross-linked copolymer by electrochemical
polymerization of dithienyl pyrrole derivative with EDOT moiety.28

Given the many advantages of copolymers,
over the last few decades,
significant progress has been made in this area. However, it is surprising
that practically nothing is known about the copolymer of EDOT with
the DAD monomer unit.28,29 Although, the DAD polymer has
interesting optoelectronic properties for different possible applications.8,30 According to the recent investigation, regio-irregular polymer synthesized
from the unsymmetrical monomer unit enhances the charge-transport
properties.31 Thus, these results created
our interest to consider the three unsymmetrical DAD monomer units M1–M3 for electrochemical copolymerization
with EDOT moiety (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of Monomers M1–M3 and EDOT Used for Electrochemical Polymerization
Furthermore, various conjugated
polymers such as polythiophene,
polyaniline, polypyrrole, polyselenophene, polycarbazole, DAD polymer,
and so forth have been successfully reported for electrochromic applications.3 Among these PEDOT, DAD polymers and their derivatives
have attracted more attention due to their fast switching time, high
optical contrast, and persistent reversible optical response.3 According to the past study performed on conjugated
polymers, most of the electrochromic polymers have either red or blue
color in their neutral state, whereas very few conjugated systems32 have been reported in the literature to be a
green or other color polymer in the neutral state.

Considering
many promising properties of PEDOT and DAD polymers
and their derivatives, we have decided to synthesize random copolymers
by electrochemical polymerization using a mixture of EDOT and DAD
monomers to find new properties and a more effective way to control
the optoelectronic properties in conjugated polymers. In this work,
we have prepared three random copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 by electrochemical polymerization
of DAD monomers M1–M3 with EDOT moiety,
respectively, using a 1:1 molar ratio of the corresponding monomers.
For comparison purpose, polymers P1–P3 have been obtained from the corresponding monomer units by electrochemical
polymerization. We also present efficient synthesis, characterization,
and comparative density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the
monomers M1–M3 and polymers P1–P3. Furthermore, we also report the
cyclic voltammetry (CV), spectroelectrochemistry, and electrochromic
properties of all polymers P1–P3 and
copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3. These results clearly indicate that the copolymers show significantly
different optoelectronic properties compared to their constituent
polymers. This investigation presents a general method for electrochemical
copolymerization by using a mixture of DAD and EDOT units for making
random copolymers.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of DAD Monomers
The known
DAD monomers M1,33M2,34 and M3(34) were synthesized according to the adopted modified literature
procedure from commercially available compounds. The fluorine-substituted
monomer M1 was obtained by Stille coupling reaction between
2-tributylstannylthiophene and 5-fluoro-4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)
[(Ph3P)4Pd] in refluxing toluene in 66% yield
as an orange solid (see Scheme S1 in the
Supporting Information (SI)). 5-Fluoro-4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
was prepared from 1,2-diamino-4-fluorobenzene in two steps.35 Similarly, the Stille coupling reaction of 4,7-dibromo-thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine with 2-tributylstannylthiophene in the presence
of (Ph3P)4Pd in toluene gave unsymmetrical monomer M2 in 60% yield as a red solid (Scheme S2). The unsymmetrical selenium analogue M3 was
prepared from 2-tributylstannylthiophene and 4,7-dibromo-selenadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine by the Stille coupling reaction in 52% yield
as a red solid (Scheme S3). 4,7-Dibromo-selenadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine was synthesized from 2,5-dibromopyridine-3,4-diamine,
as shown in Scheme S3.36

2.2 UV–Vis Absorption
Spectroscopy
UV–vis absorption spectra of monomers M1–M3 were measured in dichloromethane.
All of the three monomers
show two well-defined peaks, as shown in Figure 1. The peak at around 270–350 nm originated
from π–π* transition derived from the main conjugation
of backbone, while the lower-energy peak corresponds to the charge
transfer from thiophene to acceptor moiety. It may be noted that parent
thiophene absorbs at λmax 232 nm and EDOT absorbs
at λmax 256 nm. The lower-energy absorption bands
of M2 and M3 (λonset of M2 and M3 are 560 and 595 nm, respectively) show
bathochromic shift (red shift) compared to M1 (λonset = 515 nm), which may be due to more electron-deficient
nature of pyridine ring in M2 and M3 compared
to benzene ring in M1. Furthermore, the selenium analogue M3 exhibits red-shifted absorption compared to monomer M2. Previously, it is reported that selenium analogue
has a lower band gap compared to sulfur analogue.37

2.3 Electropolymerization
The electrochemical
polymerization of monomers M1–M3 was
performed in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in dichloromethane containing 0.01 M monomer concentration
by repetitive cycles over the active range of anodic redox potential
of the monomers. The oxidation peaks of M1–M3 were initiated to be around ∼1.11, 1.23, and 1.14
V, respectively (Figure 2a for M1 and Figure S1 for M2 and M3 in the SI).34 Under repeated cycles, monomers were polymerized to produce insoluble
and stable polymer films P1–P3 (Scheme 2) on the working
electrodes.

Figure 2 Multisweep electropolymerization of monomers: (a) M1, (b) mixture of EDOT and M1 (1:1), (c) mixture of EDOT
and M2 (1:1), and (d) mixture of EDOT and M3 (1:1) on glassy carbon electrode using 0.1 M TBAPF6 in
dichloromethane.

Scheme 2 Polymers P1–P3 Obtained via Electrochemical
Polymerization of M1–M3, Respectively
Following the electrochemical
polymerization of the monomers M1–M3, we focused our attention on electrochemical
copolymerization using DAD monomers with EDOT moiety. Copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 (Scheme 3) were prepared by
electrochemical polymerization using a 1:1 molar ratio of DAD monomers M1–M3 with EDOT, respectively, having
a total monomer concentration of 0.01 M and 0.1 M TBAPF6 as supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane (Figure 2b–d). In all of the cases under anodic
polymerization condition, insoluble and stable polymer films were
produced on electrodes. It should be mentioned here that small difference
in oxidation potentials between DAD monomers M1–M3 and EDOT is quite feasible to produce equimolecular copolymer.

Scheme 3 Copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 Obtained via Electrochemical Copolymerization of EDOT with M1–M3, Respectively, Using a 1:1 Molar
Ratio
To find more information about
the redox behavior of the polymer
films, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was studied in a monomer-free solution
using TBAPF6/acetonitrile as an electrolyte and solvent
system. All of the polymer films P1, P2, P3, PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 were also investigated under different scan rates in CVs,
as presented in Figures 3 and S2. It is observed that the CVs of
copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 are quite different from those of polymers P1–P3, respectively (Table 1). A linear dependence between peak current intensity
and scan rate for all of the polymers has been observed (Figure S3 in the SI). This linear relationship
suggests that the electrochemical behaviors of the films are non-diffusion-controlled.
The ratio of ipa to ipc suggests the pseudo behavior of polymers. This might
be due to slow interfacial transfer of electrons and slow transition
between oxidized and neutral states. Moreover, all of the polymers
films are stable under different scan rates and show good adherence
behavior on the electrode surface. Further, the stability during cycling
and switching is also a very important characteristic of such type
of polymers for possible commercial applications. The electrochemical
stabilities of the polymer films P1, P2, P3, PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 were investigated by repeated cycles between neutral and
oxidized states at a scan rate of 200 mV s–1, and
the films are found to be reasonably stable (Figure S4). The introduction of the EDOT unit in the copolymers improved
the stabilities of PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 compared to the polymers P1–P3. It may be mentioned here that most of the charge losses
occurred during the initial cycles (i.e., between 1st and 50th cycles),
whereas no significant charge loss has been observed between 51th
and 100th cycles. Thus, the stability of the films is comparable to
the previously reported stability of the other DAD polymers.38

2.4 Spectroelectrochemistry
Spectroelectrochemical
studies of the electrochemically prepared polymer films P1, P2, P3, PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 were carried out to investigate
the electronic properties, band gap, doping level, and the effect
of copolymerization.34 All of the spectroelectrochemical
measurements were recorded in acetonitrile using 0.1 M TBAPF6 as electrolyte by applying different potentials from initially neutral
to oxidized state. The spectroelectrochemical studies of P1, PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 obtained on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass are shown in Figure 4, while P2 and P3 films are presented in Figure S5.

in monomer-free solution using 0.1 M TBAPF6 in acetonitrile
at different applied potentials.

The optical band gaps of the polymers calculated from the
onset
of the absorption spectra are shown in Table 1. The optical band gaps of electron-deficient
pyridine ring-based polymers P2 and P3 are
1.63 and 1.57 eV, respectively, which are comparable to the reported
values (slight difference might be due to the point of comparison
being from the onset of absorption spectra).34 The optical band gap of P3 is slightly lower than that
of P2 because of the presence of Se atom in the peripheral
ring in P3. It should be noted that previously the Se-containing
polymers have a slightly lower band gap than the S-containing polymers.37 The optical band gap of benzene ring-based polymer P1 (1.64 eV) is comparable to that of P2. The
optical band gaps of all of the copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 are slightly lower compared
to the band gaps of constituting polymers P1–P3, respectively. As shown in spectroelectrochemistry of all
of the polymers and copolymers (Figures 4 and S5), a series
of spectra were collected at various potentials ranging from neutral
state to oxidized state. All of the films in the neutral state exhibit
a wide range of colors, as shown in Figure S6. As electrochemical doping of the polymers increases by applying
potential, the strong absorption peak at about ∼550 nm gradually
decreases and generates polarons and bipolarons at the near-IR region.
Importantly, few polymers change their color significantly from neutral
state to oxidized state.

2.5 Electrochromic Properties
The electrochromic
behaviors of the polymer films P1, P2, P3, PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 were explored using the chronoamperometric technique to
investigate the switching time, optical contrasts, and transmittance
change in both visible and near-IR regions. The polymers show good
optical contrasts in both visible and near-IR regions. The electrochromic
properties for the polymers are summarized in Table S1. For example, the optical contrasts for polymer P1 were calculated as 11.4% at 382 nm, 15.3% at 582 nm, and
24.8% at 1100 nm, whereas P2 shows slightly lower optical
contrasts (Figure 5a,b). However, we could not find relevant data for P3 as the transmittance was very poor and no redox-stable species was
found after few cycles. Similarly, optical contrasts of copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 are shown
in Figure 5c–e.
Interestingly, PE-co-M2 and PE-co-M3 show significant
transmittance changes between their redox states in both visible and
IR regions. The coloration efficiency was also calculated for all
of the polymers, which show maximum values for PE-co-M2 (99.92 cm2 C–1 at 548 nm and 69.23 cm2 C–1 at 1100 nm). The electropolymerized polymers exhibit a short response
time (<1 s) in several reduction and oxidation processes. We found
that in general, reduction process shows comparatively less response
time than their oxidation (Table S1). In
particular, P1 obtained its 95% of optical contrast in
0.83 s at 382 nm during the reduction process. P2 also
shows less response times of 1.11 and 0.31 s in the visible region
and 0.57 and 0.26 s in the IR region during its oxidation and reduction
processes, respectively (for 95% of the optical contrasts). Likely,
copolymers also show good response time for both the reduction and
oxidation processes. The Coulomb efficiency for all of the polymers
(except P3, no suitable data could be generated) was
found to be close to 100% for many cycles. This predicts that the
charge consumed in the oxidation process is almost the same as its
ejection during reduction. These data indicate that the redox process
and the color variation occur completely and reversibly. The electrochromic
properties analyzed in this study are promising, and all of the polymers
and copolymers may be suitable candidates for the energy-saving window
applications.

2.6 Computational
Study
Chemical structures
of monomers M1–M3 were optimized
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The calculated dihedral angle,
HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO–LUMO gap for the monomers are presented
in Table S2. The optimized structures are
highly planar, and the calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps of M1–M3 are in excellent agreement with the experimental
optical band gap (Figure S7 and Table S2). Polymers P1–P3 were calculated
at the PBC/B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory by using the polymer unit
cell by attaching two monomer units  anti to each other. Interestingly,
the optimized geometries of P1–P3 are planar as shown in Figures S8–S10. The calculated band gaps of P1 (Eg = 1.66 eV), P2 (Eg = 1.52 eV), and P3 (Eg = 1.44 eV) are in excellent agreement with the experimental band
gap from the spectroelectrochemistry (the calculated band gap is consistently
overestimated by 0.1 eV) (Table 2). It is observed that the replacement of S atom with
Se atom of the heterocyclic ring in polymer P3 causes
slight decrease in the band gap (∼0.1 eV).

We have shown that electrochemical
copolymerization is a potential
strategy to tune the HOMO energy level, band gap, and color of the
copolymer. This observation is supported by CV, spectroelectrochemistry,
and electrochromic measurement. We can summarize that the copolymer
with EDOT moiety has a higher-lying HOMO level and a lower band gap
compared to its constituent polymers.

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 General Information
Reagents of reagent
grade were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used
without purification unless noted. In most of the column chromatographic
separations, hexane and dichloromethane were used as eluents unless
mentioned. Columns were prepared with silica gel (60–230 mesh). 1H NMR spectra were recorded using CDCl3 solvent
with tetramethylsilane as the external standard. Mass spectra were
taken using a Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS spectrometer. UV–vis–NIR
spectra were obtained on a UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer.

3.2 Electrochemistry and Spectroelectrochemistry
Measurements
CV spectra were carried out with Nova 1.1 Metrohm
AUTOLAB-PGSTAT. TBAPF6 was dried under vacuum. CV measurements
were performed with a three-electrode cell using 0.1 M TBAPF6 as a supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane or acetonitrile solvent.
Polymer films were obtained on electrodes using dichloromethane as
the solvent, and the CV analysis of the polymer films was done in
acetonitrile solvent. All of the measurements were performed under
a N2 atmosphere, and before each measurement, N2 was purged through the solution for 10 min to deoxygenate the system.
A Au wire was used as the counter electrode, glassy carbon electrode
(diameter, 2.0 mm) was used as the working electrode, and Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode. Ferrocene/ferrocenium
couple in this system was used for external standard. For spectroelectrochemical
measurements, polymer films were prepared on ITO-coated glass electrodes
(dimension 7 mm × 50 mm × 1.1 mm (T), Rs < 10 Ω sq–1) as
the working electrode, the counter electrode was a gold wire, and
Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode. The 0.1 M TBAPF6 as an electrolyte was used in acetonitrile. Before examining
the optical properties, the polymer films were rinsed with acetonitrile
to remove the monomers.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
three random copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 based on DAD monomers M1–M3 with EDOT moiety were obtained by electrochemical
polymerization, respectively. For comparison purpose, the monomers M1–M3 were electrochemically polymerized
to obtain the polymers P1–P3, respectively.
We have also presented efficient synthesis, characterization, and
comparative DFT calculations of the monomers M1–M3 and polymers P1–P3. A
comparative study on CV, spectroelectrochemistry, and the electrochromic
properties of all polymers P1–P3 and
copolymers PE-co-M1, PE-co-M2, and PE-co-M3 was carried out and it was found that electrochemical copolymerization
is a powerful strategy to tune the HOMO level, band gap, and color
of the copolymer. It was summarized that the copolymer with EDOT moiety
has a higher-lying HOMO level and a lower band gap. Furthermore, copolymers PE-co-M2 and PE-co-M3 show better
electrochromic behavior than their corresponding polymers P2 and P3; however, in the case of PE-co-M1, no significant improvement
has been found. Further work to extend this copolymerization using
other types of donor and acceptor units for optoelectronic applications
is in progress in our laboratory.
