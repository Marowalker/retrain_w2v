Herein, we report an atomic layer
deposition (ALD) process for
Cu2O thin films using copper(II) acetate [Cu(OAc)2] and water vapor as precursors. This precursor combination enables
the deposition of phase-pure, polycrystalline, and impurity-free Cu2O thin films at temperatures of 180–220 °C. The
deposition of Cu(I) oxide films from a Cu(II) precursor without the
use of a reducing agent is explained by the thermally induced reduction
of Cu(OAc)2 to the volatile copper(I) acetate, CuOAc. In
addition to the optimization of ALD process parameters and characterization
of film properties, we studied the Cu2O films in the fabrication
of photoconductor devices. Our proof-of-concept devices show that
approximately 20 nm thick Cu2O films can be used for photodetection
in the visible wavelength range and that the thin film photoconductors
exhibit improved device characteristics in comparison to bulk Cu2O crystals.

Introduction
Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) is a p-type semiconductor material
that crystallizes in a simple cubic structure.1 The p-type conductivity of Cu2O originates from intrinsic
Cu vacancies in the crystal lattice, which facilitates the formation
of acceptor levels approximately 0.25–0.45 eV above the valence
band maximum.2,3 Other properties of Cu2O related to its semiconducting character include an optical band
gap of 2.1–2.2 eV for the bulk material,4,5 a
high absorption coefficient in the visible wavelength range,4 hole mobility ranging from 40 to 120 cm2/(V s), and electron diffusion length reaching up to 5 μm.6−11 Moreover, Cu2O is nontoxic, low-cost, and consists of
earth-abundant elements. Due to this favorable combination of chemical,
electronic, and optical properties, Cu2O has been studied
for a wide range of applications, including heterojunction12,13 and homojunction solar cells,14,15 photoelectrochemical
water splitting,16,17 thin film transistors,10,18 nonvolatile memories,19,20 photodiodes, and photoconductors.11,21−23 Furthermore, copper(I)-based ternary oxides, such
as CuAlO224 and SrCu2O2,25 are promising candidates
for transparent p-type conductive oxides,26 and delafossite class CuMO2 (M = Ta, Fe, V) compounds
show promise in solar energy applications.27 Consequently, several methods have been developed for synthesizing
Cu2O and for modifying its chemical, electronic, and optical
properties. These methods include solvothermal methods,28 electrodeposition,14,16,29 sol–gel synthesis,30 thermal oxidation of copper,4,5,31 sputtering,2,7 chemical vapor deposition
(CVD),32−34 and atomic layer deposition (ALD).23,35−39 From these methods, the solvothermal approach produces freestanding,
one-dimensional Cu2O nanostructures, whereas the rest of
the techniques are better suited for synthesizing Cu2O
thin films. Among the thin film synthesis methods, ALD stands out
due to its unique ability to produce conformal, high-quality and pinhole-free
films uniformly on large area substrates.40,41

The ability of ALD to produce high-quality thin films originates
from a deposition mechanism where the film growth proceeds via saturative
and self-limiting surface reactions between alternately supplied gaseous
precursors.42 This concept enables several
unique features, such as control of film thickness on a subnanometer
level, fabrication of nanolaminates, flexible introduction of dopants,43 and the deposition of conformal films on three-dimensional
structures, such as high aspect ratio vias and trenches.40,44 Previous reports on ALD of Cu2O have been based on the
use of CuCl + H2O,35 (nBu3P)2Cu(acac) + H2O/O2 (Bu = butyl, acac = acetylacetonate),36 Cu(dmamb)2 + H2O (dmamb
= 1-dimethylamino-2-methyl-2-butoxy),23,37,38 and Cu(dmap)2 + H2O (dmap =
1-dimethylamino-2-propoxide).39 The deposition
process based on CuCl + H2O is limited to temperatures
of 350 °C and higher as CuCl needs to be heated to 340 °C
to obtain sufficient vapor pressure for gas phase deposition. It was
also noted that this deposition process is not suitable for obtaining
phase-pure Cu2O films due to the reductive thermal decomposition
of CuCl that leads to the formation of metallic copper in the films.35 In the case of the (nBu3P)2Cu(acac) + H2O/O2 process, film deposition was achieved at significantly lower temperatures,
110–130 °C.36 This deposition
process exhibited good ALD characteristics, especially on SiO2 substrates. Further improvement in ALD of Cu2O
was achieved using an aminoalkoxide copper precursor, Cu(dmamb)2, in combination with water vapor.37 The optimal deposition temperature for this process with respect
to saturation, film crystallinity, and surface roughness was shown
to be 140–160 °C. Films deposited from Cu(dmamb)2 and H2O were polycrystalline, phase-pure Cu2O and contained negligible amounts of carbon and nitrogen impurities
as analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rutherford backscattering
spectrometry. In addition, the Cu2O films deposited using
the Cu(dmamb)2 + H2O process had a direct allowed
optical band gap value of 2.52 eV and hole mobility of 8.05 cm2/V.37 Finally, another aminoalkoxide
copper(II) compound, Cu(dmap)2, was used with water vapor
at 110–200°C.39 The focus of
this study was the deposition and characterization of 5 nm thick films
using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), X-ray diffraction, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. Cu2O films
deposited using the Cu(dmap)2 + H2O process
were reported to be X-ray amorphous and to oxidize upon exposure to
air, which was attributed to the small thickness of the films. Interestingly,
for both the Cu(dmamb)2 + H2O and the Cu(dmap)2 + H2O processes, the obtained films were of the
Cu(I) oxide (Cu2O) phase even though the oxidation state
of copper in these precursors is +2. This implies that copper is reduced
during the deposition process. In CVD experiments based on aminoalkoxide
copper precursors, the reducing agent was identified to be the aminoalkoxide
ligand.45,46 Therefore, it is conceivable that hydrogenated
aminoalkoxide ligands can act as in situ formed reducing agents in
ALD as well. However, this reaction mechanism has not been verified
experimentally.39

In this study,
we have used copper(II) acetate, Cu(OAc)2, in ALD to deposit
Cu2O thin films. Cu(OAc)2 is a commercially
available bulk chemical that exists both in the
hydrated form, Cu(OAc)2·H2O, as well as
in the anhydrous form.47 In the solid state,
both the hydrated form and the anhydrous variant exist as dimers.48 A clear advantage of using copper(II) acetate
in Cu2O film deposition is the low cost of the precursor,
in particular if the hydrated variant is considered.

Heating
hydrated Cu(OAc)2·H2O to approximately
110–160 °C results in the loss of water of crystallization
and the subsequent formation of anhydrous Cu(OAc)2.47,49 At temperatures where volatilization starts to occur, the thermal
properties of Cu(OAc)2 are complicated by both the reduction
of copper and the formation of cluster molecules in the gas phase.50 A thermogravimetric study performed under a
dynamic N2 atmosphere showed that heating Cu(OAc)2 to 200 °C in oxygen-free conditions results in the reduction
of copper from Cu2+ to Cu+ and the evaporation
of copper(I) acetate, CuOAc.47 The reduction
of Cu(OAc)2 to CuOAc upon heating in vacuo was observed
also in another thermogravimetric study.51 There, it was also noted that the residue of heated Cu(OAc)2 contained both Cu2O and metallic Cu. This indicates
that the reduction of Cu(OAc)2 to CuOAc is likely to proceed
via a two-stage, solid state comproportionation reaction. In the first
stage, Cu(OAc)2 is partially decomposed to form metallic
copper 1  The in situ formed metallic copper then reacts
with Cu(OAc)2 and volatile CuOAc is formed via comproportionation 2  The existence of this reaction pathway is
supported by the fact that CuOAc can be obtained from Cu(OAc)2 by heating the latter to 180–190 °C together
with copper dust in reduced pressure.52 If Cu(OAc)2 is heated to 290 °C and above in oxygen-free
conditions, complete decomposition of the compound occurs47 and results in the formation of metallic copper
and volatile species deriving from the acetate ligand, such as acetic
acid, acetone carbon dioxide, and water.53

The reduction of Cu(OAc)2 to CuOAc has also been
shown
to occur by means of mass spectroscopy.50 In an extensive study by Didonato and Busch, it was demonstrated
that a majority of the volatile species forming from Cu(OAc)2 contain copper as Cu+, which is in agreement with the
findings of the thermogravimetric experiments described in the literature.47,51 The mass spectrometric study also established that volatile copper(I)
species that result from heating Cu(OAc)2 form cluster
molecules that contain either two, three, or four copper atoms.50 This implies that CuOAc species in the gas phase
are either dimeric, trimeric, or tetrameric. In the context of ALD,
the thermally induced reduction of Cu(OAc)2 to CuOAc is
significant because it enables the deposition of Cu(I) films from
a Cu(II) precursor without the need for a reducing agent.

To
examine the use of Cu(OAc)2 as a precursor in ALD,
we have conducted a complete process development study using water
vapor as the co-reactant. This precursor combination produces Cu2O films at deposition temperatures of 180–220 °C.
The deposition chemistry described herein fulfills the characteristics
of an exemplary ALD process, namely saturation with respect to both
precursors, accurate thickness control, and the deposition of highly
crystalline, impurity-free films. Moreover, we demonstrate that this
ALD chemistry can be used to fabricate photoconductor devices and
that these devices exhibit photoconductivity and appreciable spectral
responsivity under illumination in the visible wavelength range.

Results
and Discussion
Film Deposition Experiments
In the
film deposition
experiments, both Cu(OAc)2·H2O and Cu(OAc)2 were tested for their suitability in ALD. No significant
differences in the films deposited from Cu(OAc)2·H2O compared to the films deposited from anhydrous Cu(OAc)2 were observed. An apparent reason for this finding is that
Cu(OAc)2·H2O is converted to anhydrous
Cu(OAc)2 in the process of heating the copper precursor
to its ALD source temperature, 175–185 °C. Close to the
source temperature, the reduction of Cu(OAc)2 starts to
take place, and CuOAc is evaporated. Because several thermal events
occur before the source temperature is reached, Cu(OAc)2·H2O does not appear as an ideal ALD precursor. However,
no adverse effects related to the conversion of Cu(OAc)2·H2O to Cu(OAc)2 were detected in the
film deposition experiments. Moreover, film deposition did not occur
without the co-reactant (H2O), i.e., when the pulsing sequence
[Cu(OAc)2·H2O—purge] was repeated
for 2000 cycles, which indicates that the water of crystallization
does not contribute to the film deposition. In the following discussion,
we will refer to the copper precursor as Cu(OAc)2 because
the water of crystallization in Cu(OAc)2·H2O is removed at temperatures relevant to film deposition. Similarly,
as the evaporating copper species is Cu(I) acetate, we refer to the
copper precursor in the gas phase as CuOAc.

Film deposition
was studied in the temperature range of 180–240 °C. Deposition
experiments related to the effect of deposition temperature and saturation
were performed using 1000 deposition cycles. For the depositions done
at 180 °C, a source temperature of 175 °C for Cu(OAc)2 was used to maintain a thermal gradient between the copper
precursor and the substrates. For the film deposition experiments
at 200–240 °C, a source temperature of 185 °C was
used. As seen from Figure 1a, the growth per cycle (GPC) values for films deposited by
1000 cycles were 0.13 ± 0.01 at 180 °C and 0.11 ± 0.01
at 200–240 °C.

The dashed lines in panels (a)–(c) are to guide the reader’s
eye. The solid line in panel (d) is a linear fit to the data points.
The R2 value describing the goodness of
fit is 0.99365.

The GPC values obtained
for Cu2O in the temperature
range of 180–220 °C are low, which renders the deposition
of films thicker than 100 nm impractical. However, we note that the
GPC values obtained for the Cu2O deposition process described
herein are comparable to those based on (nBu3P)2Cu(acac) + H2O (<0.10 Å
on SiO2 substrates),36 Cu(dmamb)2 + H2O (0.13 Å at 140–160 °C),37 and Cu(dmap)2 + H2O processes
(0.12 Å at 120–160 °C).39 Films deposited at 240 °C were visibly metallic due to the
thermal decomposition of CuOAc. As the aim of this work was to deposit
Cu2O films, deposition experiments at temperatures above
240 °C were not conducted.

Saturation experiments were
performed with 1000 deposition cycles
at 200 °C. As seen from Figure 1b,c, the saturative growth mode characteristic to ALD
was obtained for both Cu(OAc)2 and H2O using
2.0 s pulses. For films deposited by 1000 cycles, 3.0 s long purge
times for both precursors were sufficient for obtaining uniform films
over 5 × 5 cm2 substrates (Figure S1). Finally, the thicknesses of Cu2O films deposited
at 200 °C with an increasing number of deposition cycles were
measured (Figure 1d).
Atypically, for an ALD metal oxide process, the GPC of the Cu2O films did not remain constant as the number of deposition
cycles was increased. The application of 500 and 1000 deposition cycles
at 200 °C resulted in films with thicknesses of 6.5 and 11.3
nm, respectively, which averages to a GPC of 0.12 Å. With 3000,
5000, and 7000, the thicknesses of the obtained films were 24.2, 43.0,
and 58.0 nm, respectively, which averages to a GPC of 0.08 Å.
This finding entails that the deposition of Cu2O using
this process is substrate-enhanced in the early stages of film growth.54,55 A probable reason for this behavior is that the adsorption density
of the copper precursor is higher on the native oxide-terminated Si
than on the Cu2O film itself. We hypothesize that this
is due to the lability of hydroxyl groups on Cu2O surfaces,
as Cu(I) hydroxides are known to decompose to oxo-terminated Cu2O at elevated temperatures.56

According to field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses (as discussed later), films
deposited with 500 cycles on Si substrates are not continuous. Consequently,
the effective surface area and the number of adsorption sites at the
early stages of the film growth is higher compared to the stage where
a Cu2O film fully covering the underlying Si substrate
has formed. Despite the nonconstant GPC over an increasing number
of deposition cycles, the thickness of Cu2O films deposited
at 200 °C could be accurately controlled in the range of 5–60
nm, which signifies that the ALD chemistry described herein is a viable
candidate to be used for applications in which sub-100 nm films are
required. The good thickness control of this ALD process was also
proven by depositing an approximately 50 nm thick Cu2O
film on a trench structure with an aspect ratio of approximately 2:1.
For this trench structure, 100% conformality was achieved using a
pulse and purge sequence of 2 s Cu(OAc)2 pulse—7
s purge—3 s H2O pulse—7 s purge (Figure S2).

Film Crystallinity and
Structure
The crystallinity
of the films was studied with X-ray diffraction in the grazing incidence
geometry. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) patterns of
films deposited with 5000 cycles at 180–240 °C are shown
in Figure 2a and the
effect of the film thickness on the crystallinity of films deposited
at 200 °C is shown in Figure 2b.

with
5000 cycles at 180–240 °C and (b) the effect of film thickness
on crystallinity at a deposition temperature of 200 °C.

The peaks in the diffractograms
shown in Figure 2 are
indexed according to the ICCD cards
for cubic Cu2O (ICCD PDF 5-667) and cubic Cu (ICCD PDF
4-836). According to GI-XRD analysis, the films deposited at 180–220
°C are polycrystalline, phase-pure cubic Cu2O. The
most intense reflections are those assignable to the (111) and (200)
planes of cubic Cu2O. Based on Rietveld refinement,57 the unit cell dimensions in Cu2O
films deposited at 180–220 °C are within ±0.01 Å
of the reported literature value of 4.2685 Å.58 As discussed above, films deposited at 240 °C were
visually metallic due to the thermal decomposition of the copper precursor.
The GI-XRD pattern of films deposited at 240 °C confirmed the
formation of metallic copper (Figure 2a). However, these films were not pure metallic copper,
as reflections assignable to both metallic Cu and Cu2O
could be observed in the diffractogram. The adhesion of the films
deposited at 240 °C was poor, which signifies that this ALD chemistry
is not suitable for depositing metallic copper thin films on oxide
surfaces. The saturation studies and GI-XRD experiments indicated
that the optimal deposition temperature for this ALD process is 200
°C. Therefore, this temperature was used to deposit films for
further characterization, including morphology studies, compositional
analysis, and study of optoelectronic properties.

The morphology
of the Cu2O films was analyzed using
FESEM and AFM. Plane-view micrographs of Cu2O film deposited
on Si substrates with 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, and 7000 cycles are presented
in Figure 3. As observed
from Figure 3a, films
deposited over 500 cycles on Si are not continuous. Upon increasing
the deposition cycle count to 1000, the underlying Si substrate is
no longer observed, which indicates the formation of a continuous
Cu2O film (Figure 3b). Films deposited with 1000, 3000, and 5000 cycles contained
larger grains that emerge from the underlying polycrystalline layer.
For films deposited over 7000 cycles, the larger grains were no longer
observed, and a more uniform surface morphology was obtained.

plane-view FESEM micrographs of Cu2O
films deposited at 200 °C over a cycle number of (a) 500 (6.5
nm), (b) 1000 (11.3 nm), (c) 3000 (24.2 nm), (d) 5000 (43.0 nm) and
(e) 7000 (58.0 nm). The 200 nm scale bar applies to all images.

The surface roughness of the Cu2O films was quantified
using AFM. The average root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values of Cu2O films deposited with 500,
1000, 3000, 5000, and 7000 cycles are listed in Table 1. Top-down view of AFM images of these films
is presented in Figure S3. According to
the AFM results, the surface roughness of Cu2O films deposited
at 200 °C increases with the increasing film thickness. This
effect is common for polycrystalline ALD films and can be attributed
to a film growth mechanism where the grain size grows with increasing
film thickness.55

Table 1 Root-Mean-Square
Surface Roughness
(Rq) Values of Cu2O Films Deposited
at 200 °C
cycle count	500	1000	3000	5000	7000	
film thickness (nm)	6.5	11.3	24.2	43.0	58.0	
Rq (nm)	4.0	1.9	3.4	7.7	9.3	
In comparison to other ALD
Cu2O processes, the deposition
process presented herein produces films of similar surface roughness.
For the Cu(dmamb)2 + H2O process, Rq values of 4.8 and 6.1 nm were reported for 30 nm thick
Cu2O films obtained at 180 and 240 °C, respectively.37 These values are comparable to the root-mean-square
roughness of 3.4 nm measured for a 24 nm thick Cu2O film
deposited at 200 °C. Notably, the surface roughness of the film
deposited by 500 cycles is 4.0 nm, which corresponds to approximately
60% of the nominal thickness of this film. Since 500 deposition cycles
at 200 °C produces isolated islands instead of continuous films,
high surface roughness is to be expected.

To study the early
stage growth in more detail, the surface roughness
of films deposited with 200, 400, 600, and 800 cycles was mapped.
From the AFM images presented in Figure 4, it can be observed that the film deposited
with 200 cycles consists primarily of isolated copper oxide islands
on the Si substrate surface, whereas 400 and 600 deposition cycles
lead to the formation of a surface texture consisting of larger grains,
and subsequently, to increased surface roughness (3.6 nm for 400 cycles
and 4.4 nm for 600 cycles). After 800 deposition cycles, the film
surface starts to smoothen, as evidenced by a decrease of Rq to 3.5 nm. In comparison to a film deposited
over 1000 cycles (film thickness 11 nm, Rq = 1.9 nm), the sample deposited with 800 cycles has a higher surface
roughness, which implies that at 200 °C continuous Cu2O layers are formed at a film thickness of approximately 11 nm. We
base this conclusion in the observation that a minimum in surface
roughness is observed at 1000 deposition cycles (Figure S4).

Compositional Analysis
of the Films
The composition
of a Cu2O film deposited at 200 °C with 7000 cycles
was studied using the combination of time-of-flight elastic recoil
detection analysis (ToF-ERDA) and XPS. ToF-ERDA is an ion-beam technique
that can be used to quantitatively detect all elements and that can
be also used for depth profiling with a resolution in the order of
nanometers, which makes this method useful in compositional analysis
of thin films.59 According to ToF-ERDA
measurements, the Cu/O ratio in the analyzed film was 1.96, which
signifies that the films are nearly stoichiometric Cu2O
(Table 2).

Table 2 Elemental Composition (atomic %) of
a Cu2O Film Deposited over 7000 Cycles at 200 °C as
Determined Using ToF-ERDA
Cu	O	H	C	Cu/O ratio	
65.8	33.6	0.4	≤0.2	1.96	
The composition of the films differs
from the stoichiometric value
of 2.0, as the films were also found to contain minor amounts of light
impurity elements, 0.4 atom % of hydrogen, and ≤0.2 atom %
of carbon. According to the ToF-ERDA depth profile presented in Figure 5a, the hydrogen in
the films is concentrated on the surface, while the bulk of the films
is free of impurities. This suggests that the surface impurities are
hydroxides that form upon exposure to ambient moisture.

Figure 5 ToF-ERDA and
XPS analysis of Cu2O films deposited at
200 °C. (a) ToF-ERDA depth profile, (b) high-resolution photoelectron
spectrum of the Cu 2p3/2 binding energy region, (c) Auger
electron spectrum in the Cu LMM KE region, (d) high-resolution photoelectron
spectrum of the O 1s binding energy region.

We emphasize that the amount of hydrogen and carbon impurities
observed in the Cu2O films is exceptionally low for ALD
metal oxide films. The low level of hydrogen and carbon impurities
incorporated in the films indicates that the film-forming surface
reactions between CuOAc and water vapor proceed in a clean manner
without ligand decomposition. This is to be expected, as the most
probable film-forming mechanism in ALD of metal oxides when using
water vapor as the co-reactant is ligand exchange.60 In the case of a metal acetate precursor such as CuOAc,
the by-product of a ligand exchange reaction is acetic acid, which
has a high vapor pressure and is thus unlikely to remain on the film
surface.61 The existence of the ligand
exchange mechanism is supported by an in situ reaction mechanism study
performed by employing quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) and quartz
crystal microbalance (QCM) techniques (Figure S5). The Supporting Information also
contains further discussion on the question of the reaction mechanism.

To complement the ToF-ERDA experiments, the Cu2O films
were analyzed with respect to the oxidation states of copper and oxygen
using XPS. Peak fitting of the photoelectron spectra was performed
using the parameters published by Biesinger et al.62,63 The XPS survey spectrum and a spectrum covering the entire Cu 2p
binding energy region are shown in Figure S6. The most intense peak in the Cu 2p3/2 binding energy
region was found at 932.4 eV, which lies 0.2 eV higher than the reported
literature value for Cu2O, 932.2 eV (Figure 5c).63 Moreover,
the main peak for Cu 2p3/2 at 932.4 eV shows asymmetry
toward higher binding energy values. We assign the minor peak shift
and asymmetry to partial surface oxidation, i.e., the formation of
a Cu2+ terminated surface. Accounting for the minor oxidation
of the film surface, the best fit to the main Cu 2p3/2 peak
was obtained by deconvolution to Cu2O (the major peak at
932.4 eV) and CuO (the broad peak at 933.6 eV). The partial oxidation
of surfaces is a well-known phenomenon for several thin film materials,
including Cu2O.64,65 However, it has been
shown that the surface oxidation of nanocrystalline Cu2O in ambient conditions proceeds only to a minor extent,65−67 as can also be observed for the films deposited in this work.

Further evidence for the deposition of Cu2O films with
minimal surface oxidation was obtained from the Cu LMM spectrum (Figure 5c), which showed
an intense peak assignable to Cu2O at 916.7 eV.63 Compared to the Cu 2p binding energy region,
the Cu LMM peak serves as a reliable fingerprint for identifying between
metallic Cu and Cu2O. Although the Cu 2p3/2 binding
energy values of Cu and Cu2O are separated only by 0.4
eV, the literature values for LMM kinetic energy of Cu (918.6 eV)
and Cu2O (917.0 eV) are separated by 1.6 eV and are therefore
more suitable for identification between the metal and oxide.63 Moreover, the Auger parameter, i.e., the sum
of the Cu 2p3/2 main peak binding energy and the Cu LMM
main peak kinetic energy is 1849.1 eV, which is in excellent agreement
with the literature value of Cu2O (1849.2 eV).63

To complete XPS analysis, the O 1s spectra
were investigated (Figure 5d). Deconvolution
of the asymmetric peak found in the O 1s binding energy range showed
maxima at 530.3 and 531.6 eV. The peak at 530.3 eV corresponds to
the lattice oxide of Cu2O, whereas the peak at 531.6 eV
can be ascribed to a defective oxygen component in Cu2O,
or to surface hydroxyl species.62,63 Both of these options
are possible sources for the O 1s signal present at 531.6 eV since
the films were found to be slightly understoichiometric and contain
excess hydrogen on the film surface (Figure 5a).

Optical and Electrical Characterization
Cu2O thin films hold potential for optoelectronic applications
that
rely on visible light because Cu2O has a high absorption
coefficient and an optical band gap in the visible range.4 To estimate the optical band gap of our Cu2O films, we employed the Tauc plot method.68,69 Furthermore, to show that ultra-thin ALD films can be used as photoconductors,
we prepared simple test structures (Figure 6a) and characterized the devices with respect
to responsivity and time constants.

test structure.

Inset: time-dependent photoresponse with chopped illumination (10
s on, 10 s off). In (b)–(d) the photoconductor was under a
10 V bias. In (c) and (d) a 405 nm laser was used for illumination.

Tauc plot analysis for a Cu2O film deposited with 3000
cycles at 200 °C revealed a direct forbidden optical band gap
of approximately 2.1 eV (Figure S7), which
is in agreement with values reported for Cu2O thin film
samples.4 Characterization of the photoconductor
structures showed that the spectral responsivity of the devices follows
the optical absorbance of the Cu2O films (Figure 6b) and that the responsivity
increases with increasing photon energy when the incident illumination
power density is kept constant. Further photocurrent measurements
revealed a definite dependence between responsivity and the illumination
power density (Figure 6c). Fitting a power law function ΔI = aPb, where ΔI is the photocurrent, P is the incident illumination power density, anda and b are constants yields ΔI ≈ P0.5. As evident
from Figure 6c and
the fitted power law exponent, the dependence of responsivity on illumination
power density is nonlinear, which is typical for photoconductor structures.
The highest responsivity, approximately 90 mA/W, was observed when
using 405 nm illumination at an incident power density of 1 mW/cm2. The responsivity of our devices based on 24 nm thick Cu2O films is comparable to values reported for photodetectors
based on electrodeposited, approximately 1 μm thick Cu2O films.70

In photodetection, time
constants for the response (τr) and decay (τd) are of interest. While our
proof-of-concept photoconductor devices displayed promising responsivities,
temporal photocurrent measurements revealed slow switching characteristics
(Figure 6d). The photocurrent
did not saturate even after 1 min of illumination and the time needed
for recovery was correspondingly long, in the order of 5 min. The
response and decay processes can be represented by a biexponential
model incorporating fast (τr1, τd1) and slow (τr2, τd2) components.
From biexponential curve fits shown in Figure 6d, we obtain time constants of τr1 = 2 s, τd1 = 22 s, τr2 = 24 s, and τd2 = 352 s. We propose that the slow
switching behavior originates from the persistent photoconductivity
(PPC) effect intrinsic to Cu2O. Two models have been proposed
to explain the PPC effect in Cu2O, that is, a model based
on dissociation and association of copper vacancy complexes by Kuzêl,71 and an electron trapping model by Tapiero et
al.72 The PPC effect causes the conductivity
of Cu2O to increase slowly under illumination and the increased
conductivity to persist even when the illumination is stopped. For
photoconductor devices, this implies an increase in the baseline current
under illumination (Figure 6d inset). In bulk crystals of Cu2O, the increase
in conductivity after illumination can persist for several days.73 However, in the case of our ultra-thin photoconductors,
the nanometer level thickness of the device contributes to a significantly
faster PPC discharge. The PPC effect in Cu2O can also be
discharged by heating the material to 120 °C and above,73 however, such an approach is impractical for
photodetection. Alternatively, introduction of dopants to the Cu2O lattice can be used to suppress the PPC effect. Isseroff
et al. suggested that lithium doping can suppress PPC in Cu2O,74 which in turn could enable photodetection
at operating temperatures close to RT, and furthermore lead to improved
response and decay times in photodetector devices based on Cu2O. As ALD is known for its capability to produce doped transition
metal oxide thin films of high-quality,43 we expect more detailed studies on this topic to emerge in the future.

Conclusions
In this work, we have studied the applicability
of copper(II) acetate
as a copper precursor in ALD. Deposition of high-quality Cu2O thin films was achieved in the temperature range of 180–220
°C when water vapor was used as the co-reactant. The ALD process
described herein exhibits saturative growth characteristics, enables
accurate thickness control, and can be used to deposit conformal films
on trench structures (AR 2:1). GI-XRD, ToF-ERDA, and XPS measurements
showed that the films deposited at 200 °C are polycrystalline,
phase-pure, and nearly stoichiometric Cu2O with less than
0.5 atom % hydrogen and carbon impurities. As the deposition temperature
range of this ALD process matches well with processes reported for
other transition metal oxides, the Cu(OAc)2 + H2O ALD process can enable new routes for depositing ternary and quaternary
Cu+-based materials, such as CuAlO2 and SrCu2O2. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we have demonstrated
that ultra-thin Cu2O films made using ALD exhibit appreciable
photoconductivity and photoresponsivity in the visible wavelength
region. The use of Cu2O thin films for photodetection applications
is, however, obstructed by the persistent photoconductivity phenomenon,
which manifests as the slow response and decay times. According to
our experiments, the adverse effect of persistent photoconductivity
is less prominent in Cu2O thin films than in bulk crystals
of Cu2O. Further material engineering efforts, such as
cation doping may improve the performance of Cu2O-based
devices and should thus be explored.

Materials and Methods
Film Deposition
Cu2O thin films were deposited
using a commercial, hot-wall F-120 ALD reactor operated in the cross-flow
configuration.75 Nitrogen (AGA, 99.999%,
O2 ≤ 3 ppm, H2O ≤ 3 ppm) was used
as both carrier and purging gas at a flow rate of 400 sccm. The reactor
pressure during the depositions was in the order of 10 mbar. Films
were deposited on 5 × 5 cm2 squares of soda lime glass
(SLG) and native oxide-terminated Si(100) (Okmetic Oy, Vantaa, Finland).
The SLG substrates were cleaned using ultrasonication with successive
baths of an alkaline cleaning solution, absolute ethanol, and deionized
water, whereas the Si substrates were used as received. Copper(II)
acetate was evaporated from an open glass boat held inside the ALD
reactor at either 175 or 185 °C depending on the deposition temperature.
Both the monohydrate, Cu(OAc)2·H2O (Sigma
Aldrich, ≥99.0%) and anhydrous Cu(OAc)2 (Sigma Aldrich,
99.99%) were used in the deposition experiments. Water vapor was led
to the reactor through a needle valve from an external reservoir held
at room temperature.

Film Characterization
All characterization
studies
were performed using films deposited on Si(100) substrates unless
otherwise noted. Film thickness was measured with X-ray reflectivity
using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer equipped
with an X-ray source emitting Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54
Å). The same diffractometer was also used to perform X-ray diffraction
(XRD) experiments. The XRD measurements were performed in the grazing
incidence (GI) geometry at an incidence angle of 1°.

Electron
microscope images of the films were obtained using a Hitachi S4800
field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Atomic force
microscopy (AFM) experiments were performed using a Veeco Multimode
V tool equipped with a Nanoscope V controller. The AFM images were
captured in the intermittent contact mode (tapping mode) in air using
Si probes with a maximum nominal radius of 10 nm (Bruker). To remove
artefacts caused by sample tilt and scanner bow, the images were flattened
using an algorithm included in the Nanoscope 1.6 software package
(Bruker). Film roughness was calculated from 2 × 2 μm2 images as root-mean-square (Rq) values.

The film composition was studied using time-of-flight
elastic recoil
detection analysis (ToF-ERDA). The ToF-ERDA measurements were conducted
using a 50 MeV 127I9+ ion beam in a configuration
described in full elsewhere.76 The chemical
state of the films was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The XPS spectra were collected with an Omicron ARGUS spectrometer
operated at a pass energy of 20 eV. The thin film samples were excited
with X-rays emitted from a standard Mg source (Kα line, photon
energy of 1253.6 eV). No sputtering was performed prior to the measurements.
The binding energy scale was calibrated using the C 1s peak of ambient
hydrocarbons located at 284.8 eV. Peak fitting was performed using
the CasaXPS software package (www.casaxps.com).

Absorbance spectra of Cu2O films deposited on
SLG substrates
were measured in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm using a
Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. Tauc plots constructed from the
absorbance data were used to estimate the optical band gaps of the
films. The band gap analysis was performed for a direct forbidden
band gap, as prompted by Malerba et al.4

Photoconductor Fabrication and Electrical Measurements
Photoconductor
structures were made by evaporating copper electrodes
through a source–drain shadow mask (Ossila E321, channel width
1 mm, channel length 30 μm) onto Cu2O films deposited
on SLG substrates by 3000 cycles at 200 °C (film thickness of
approximately 24 nm). Electrical measurements were performed using
a Keithley 2450 sourcemeter. Laser diodes emitting at 405, 450, 532,
635, 780, and 980 nm (Thorlabs) were used to illuminate the devices
from the film side. The incident power density on the device surface
was controlled with neutral density filters. Due to the persistent
photoconductivity effect in Cu2O, responsivity values were
calculated from the difference between the photocurrent and dark current
obtained from temporal photocurrent measurements (sample illuminated
for 10 s and kept in the dark for 10 s).
