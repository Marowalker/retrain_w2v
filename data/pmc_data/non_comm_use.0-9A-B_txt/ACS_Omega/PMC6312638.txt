This
article provides a survey of four “unconventional”
methods employed in the synthesis of natural products in the Hudlicky
group. The utility of flash vacuum pyrolysis is highlighted by examples
of many natural products attained via vinylcyclopropane–cyclopentene
rearrangement and its heterocyclic variants. Preparative organic electrochemistry
was used in oxidations and reductions with levels of selectivity unattainable
by conventional methods. Yeast reduction of ketoesters was featured
in the total synthesis of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Finally, the use
of toluene dioxygenase-mediated dihydroxylations in enantioselective
synthesis of natural products concludes this presentation. Recently,
synthesized targets in the period 2010–2019 are listed in the

are placed in appropriate context with the work of others, and a detailed
guide to the current literature is provided.

1 Introduction
The practice and the methods
of organic synthesis have changed
very little in the last (almost) 200 years.‡ The new technology, such as modern analytical instrumentation, made
it possible to accrue results at a faster rate and with very small
quantities of material. However, the actual physical execution of
experiments has changed very little; we still perform reactions in
ordinary glassware and follow up with ordinary work up and purification.
Compared with the advances in biology, especially molecular biology
and genomics, there has not been a detectable paradigm shift in the
way we perform organic synthesis of complex molecules. Of course,
there exist some departures from “conventional” methods
that have appeared in the last 50 years or so. These would include
the use of ultrasound, microwave, mechanochemistry, photochemistry,
flow technology, development of transition metal catalysis, and other
improvements.1 Major developments in computational
chemistry have allowed advances and predictions, especially in catalysis.
Electrochemical and enzymatic methods have been used in total synthesis
occasionally but not with the frequency of use of the above-mentioned
techniques. The use of lipases is well established as a means of resolution
of meso compounds, but the employment of oxidoreductases is less common.
Even less common is the use of preparative electrochemistry.

In this review, four “unconventional” methods are
discussed in the context of their contribution to specific research
problems in the Hudlicky group over the last four decades. A brief
literature overview and the state of the art are provided also.

2 Discussion
2.1 Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis
(FVP)
Pyrolysis
(Greek pyr and lysis; separation by fire) has been used since ancient
times and middle ages to prepare methanol, sulfuric acid, glass, and
other products. The use of high temperature to effect chemical transformations
dates back to the 19th century and was frequently used in structure
elucidation of natural products by degradation. A classic experiment
in this category is, without a doubt, von Gerichten’s pyrolysis
of morphine in 18812 that produced phenanthrene,
as shown in Figure 1. He mixed 10 g of morphine with a 10-fold excess weight of zinc
dust and heated the dry mixture to 300 °C. Purification of the
distillate yielded crystalline phenanthrene identified by its melting
point (98–100 °C), elemental analysis, smell, and taste!
This single experiment established, together with an additional “gentler
and kinder” confirmation by Hofmann elimination,3 that the phenanthrene core of morphine contained
14 of 17 carbon atoms of this alkaloid.

Figure 1 von Gerichten’s
degradation of morphine to phenanthrene
and morphol.

Besides the use of pyrolysis
in degradation studies, various forms
of this technique have been applied to rearrangements requiring elevated
temperatures. These techniques include heating a solution in a sealed
tube or an autoclave, passing a solution through a hot tube under
inert gas, gas-phase pyrolysis under a flow of inert gas, and evaporation
of a substance through a hot tube under high vacuum, i.e., flash vacuum
pyrolysis (FVP). Many other experimental variations exist, and these
have been well reviewed.4 The advantage
of FVP rests in the very short time that the substrate spends in the
hot zone (milliseconds) under high vacuum (∼10–5 mm/Hg). Under these conditions, molecular collisions are minimized
and all of the thermal energy is used for activation.

When I
started my independent career at the Illinois Institute
of Technology, one of my projects involved the development of a two-step
[4 + 1] cyclopentene annulation as a general method of synthesis
for triquinane terpenes.5 The method is
comprised of intramolecular cyclopropanation followed by thermal rearrangement
of vinylcyclopropanes to cyclopentenes.6 Eventually, this method evolved into a more efficient [2 + 3]
intermolecular annulation,7 as depicted
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Evolution of
FVP-based annulation strategies for the synthesis
of natural product frameworks containing five-membered rings.

Both methods relied on FVP at
∼550 °C for the rearrangement
to annulated cyclopentenes. Initial experiments were met with failure,
and pyrolysis of the vinylcyclopropane provided mixtures of various
dienes and decomposition products.

Reviewing the background
of the vinylcyclopropane–cyclopentene
rearrangement yielded an interesting piece of information: In Corey’s
1975 paper,8 a footnote described performing
the rearrangement by FVP through a tube containing chips of “lead
potash glass”. Such material was no longer available, because
of FDA safety concerns, and we have instead performed the pyrolysis
by using a Vycor tube pretreated with a slurry of PbCO3.§ This protocol provided excellent results
and reasonable yields of cyclopentenes.

It is not clear what
exactly the role of lead would be in the high-temperature
rearrangement. After the pyrolysis, we observed that the Vycor tube
was coated with metallic lead. This, of course, would require a reduction.
Some speculation has been advanced but has not been substantiated.§

A possible explanation would involve the pyrolysis
of lead carbonate
to lead(II) oxide and CO2, dissociation of the vinylcyclopropane
to a carbene species, trapping of it with PbO (producing lead carbenoid
and N2O), metallo-Diels–Alder cycloaddition, and
reductive elimination. These methods later evolved into [4 + 1]
azide-diene annulation and were applied to the synthesis of pyrrolizidine
alkaloids.9

Since its discovery by
Neureiter in 1959,10 many applications
of the vinylcyclopropane–cyclopentene rearrangement
and its heteroatom variants have been reported. Note that the corresponding
cylopropylimine–pyrroline rearrangement had been reported in
1929 by Cloke.11 In Figure 3, we highlight some of the historical milestones
of these rearrangements. The rearrangement of the parent system to
cyclopentene was reported independently in 1960–1961 by the
group of Vogel, Overberger, and Frey.12 Vinyloxirane–dihydrofuran rearrangement followed in 1971,
published by Paladini and Chuche.13 Atkinson
and Rees,14 and Lwowski15 reported the vinylaziridine–pyrroline rearrangement
in 1967–1968. Wilson provided the conditions for cyclopropyl
aldehyde–dihydrofuran rearrangement as early as 1947.16 It is also likely that some of these rearrangements
occurred much earlier but were not identified as such. For example,
the vinylcyclopropane–cyclopentene rearrangement may have taken
place during the preparation of vinylcyclopropane itself by Hofmann
elimination at high temperatures.17 In
all synthetic applications, some form of high-temperature thermolysis
was employed to provide the required activation energy.

Figure 3 Some of the
milestones in the rearrangements of vinylcyclopropanes
and their heteroatom analogues.

In the applications to natural product syntheses, most of
the high-temperature
rearrangements proceeded in respectable yields. The success depends
on the volatility of the substrate and/or the quality of the vacuum
attainable. Figure 4 shows selected examples of terpene synthesis that featured the vinylcyclopropane–cyclopentene
rearrangement. In 1979, Piers used it in his synthesis of zizaene
(26)18 and Trost employed
his cyclopentene annulation method in the total synthesis of aphidicolin
(29).19 In the 1980s, the
rearrangement was featured in many syntheses of cyclopentane-containing
terpenes especially during the so-called “triquinane era”.
Paquette’s synthesis of α-vetispirene (35)20 reportedly proceeded in 100% yield!
[Unfortunately, the treatise on the practical limits of chemical yields
was not available until 2010.21]. In 1978,
our group initiated a program aimed at a general synthesis of natural
products containing five-membered rings. The program was successful,
as evidenced by the attainment of many triquinane terpenes, such as
hirsutene (32),22 isocomene
(38),23 pentalenic acid (41),24 and most notably, a 14-step
synthesis of the racemate of retigeranic acid (44),25 still standing as the shortest one to date.
The preparation of terpenoids the size of retigeranic acid (44) or aphidicolin (29) may very well define
the limits of the utility of FVP, as substrates of higher molecular
weight may not be fully vaporized, even under very high vacuum.

Figure 4 Vinylcyclopropane–cyclopentene
rearrangement in terpene
synthesis.

Heteroatom variants of the rearrangement
(oxa-, aza-, and thia-)
were also employed in total synthesis of natural products, some of
which are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Examples of natural products attained from the heteroatom variants
of the vinylcyclopropane–cyclopentene rearrangement.

The syntheses of mesembrine (45)26 and aspidospermine (46)27 by Stevens featured the cylopropylimine–pyrroline
rearrangement, as did Pinnick’s synthesis of isoretronecanol
(47).28 Vinylaziridine–pyrroline
rearrangement was featured in our syntheses of supinidine (48)29 and hastanecine (49),30 among others. In addition to FVP, a low-temperature
rearrangement by nucleophilic opening and reclosure was also employed.31 Vinyloxirane–dihydrofuran rearrangement
was employed in our synthesis of ipomeamarone (50).32 It would appear that the various forms of the
rearrangement resurfaced during the first decade of the 21st century.
Somfai’s synthesis of anisomycin (51)33 featured a vinylaziridine–pyrroline rearrangement.
Njardarson’s synthesis of biotin (52)34 featured a vinylthiirane–dihydrothiophene
rearrangement, whereas salviasperanol (53)35 was prepared by Majetich via vinyloxirane–dihydrofuran
rearrangement.

From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that
the use of FVP
had an enormous impact on the total synthesis of natural products
via the vinylcyclopropane–cyclopentene rearrangement and its
heterocyclic variants. Only a few examples of this technology have
been discussed in this chapter, and for a more detailed listing, recent
reviews can be consulted.6f,6g,7

2.2 Preparative Organic Electrochemistry
The
use of electrochemistry in synthetic organic chemistry is not
very common. It is widely used by physical organic chemists and, of
course, in industry for the manufacturing of many commodity chemicals.
In preparative organic chemistry, electrochemistry represents an ideal
technology for oxidations and reductions by removal or addition of
electrons by Faraday units. For this reason, we have referred to it
as a “no reagent approach” to synthesis.36 In the United States, this technology has been
widely used by several groups in methodology development as well as
in application to natural product synthesis. Incorporation of electrochemistry
into daily usage requires some investment into instrumentation and
a bit of a learning curve on the part of the chemist. When an electrochemical
oxidation or reduction is appropriate for a solution of a problem
and when such a transformation is successful, it is far superior to
any traditional method. The applications of electrochemistry to organic
synthesis have been reviewed and appear to enjoy a recent renaissance.37

A few beautiful examples are shown in Figures 6 and 7. Little employed cathodic reduction followed by oxidation
in his synthesis of hirsutene to generate the azo intermediate 57 as a direct precursor to the diyl 58 whose
cyclization produced the linear triquinane 59, which
was converted to hirsutene (32), as shown in Figure 6.38 Little also applied electrochemical reductive cyclizations
in his synthesis of quadrone (64),39 as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Little’s syntheses of hirsutene (32) and quadrone
(64).

Figure 7 Electrochemical furan
annulations by Wright and Moeller.

Wright applied electrochemical furan annulations and [4 + 3]
cycloadditions to the synthesis of tricyclic systems such as 67,40 envisioned to be useful in
an approach to the nerve growth factors such as erinacine (68), as shown in Figure 7. The electrochemical furan annulations were developed into a general
method of synthesis.41 Moeller applied
this methodology to a creative synthesis of alliacol (71) in 2004.42 Other notable examples of
electrochemical transformations can be found in the cited reviews.

We entered this field by accident (literally) and out of dire necessity
because the project we were working on presented serious hazards.
In the mid-1990s, we were asked by Novartis Crop Protection, Inc.
to synthesize some presumed metabolites of the insecticide pymetrozine
(72) isolated from several soil samples. The structures
of the two metabolites were assigned by mass spectrometry, and synthetic
samples were required for matching. Eventually, a large amount of
both metabolites would be required and a reliable procedure provided
to prepare 14C-labeled samples for soil fate studies. The
synthesis of both 73 and 74 was extremely
arduous and required anionic hydroxylation, as shown in Figure 8. Several attempts at the synthesis
of 73 and 74 by various condensation approaches
failed. The anionic hydroxylation shown in Figure 8 did provide small amounts of the desired
metabolite after multiple chromatographic separations. We adjusted
the synthesis to a 20 g scale and successfully ran 16 reactions, producing
∼2.6 grams of 73 per run. The 17th attempt exploded
during the warm-up phase completely destroying the fume hood [the
lithium peroxide intermediate, small peroxides derived from s-BuLi, oxygen, and tetrahydrofuran formed a very hazardous
mixture]. Because >150 grams of product was eventually required,
we
had to get creative [it was estimated that to complete this task by
the current method, at least 45 new fume hoods would have to be acquired!].

Figure 8 Anionic
hydroxylation of pymetrozine.

The solution to the problem was provided by the anodic oxidation
of pymetrozine, as shown in Figure 9, and proved to be remarkably effective. We were able
to eventually produce >150 g of the desired metabolite 73 as well as 74, by performing the electrochemical oxidation
on different derivatives of pymetrozine.43 The advantage of using the electrochemical method was clear: no
hazard, clean conversion, effective solution to the problem, and great
savings in time [to produce the initial small samples took >6 months
of effort. To prepare 150 g of 73 by electrochemical
oxidation took 3 days!].

Figure 9 Electrochemical oxidation of pymetrozine on
a medium scale.

Encouraged by these results,
we have initiated our own forays into
electrochemistry with the intent to develop selective methods of oxidation
and reduction. Some examples of such selective transformations are
shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Examples of electrochemical oxidations and reductions.

For example, anodic oxidation of 77 under the conditions
similar to those used for pymetrozine produced a mixture of hemiaminals 78 that were then cyclized under Lewis acidic conditions to
octahydroisoquinoline 79, an intermediate in one of our
approaches to morphine.44 Electrochemical
reduction of vinyl bromide in 80 was accomplished with
mercury pool cathode and proved the method of choice for generation
of many intermediates used for the synthesis of inositols.45 A highly selective reduction of vinyl iodide
over vinyl bromide in 81 was also achieved, as was oxidation
of the diene diol 82 to the syn epoxide 84 (via the intermediate bromohydrin 83).45 Electrochemical reduction of the alkenyl bromide 85 derived chemoenzymatically from p-bromothioanisole
was accomplished selectively using a mercury pool cathode to furnish
diene diol 86,46 as shown
in Figure 10. Such
selectivity might not be attainable by using conventional reducing
agents. It should be noted that diol 86 was not available
by enzymatic dihydroxylation of thioanisole (only the corresponding
sulfoxide was obtained).46

To expand
the utility of electrochemical reductions, we became
interested in the selectivity of reduction of allyl and cinnamyl groups
as a means of differential protection in the synthesis of conduritols.
Some examples of highly selective reductions are shown in Figure 11. The selective
deprotection of the cinnamyl group over allyl group was accomplished
in the bis-ethers 87 and 90 at −2.8
V (Hg pool).47 Note the comparison with
the classic dissolved-metal reduction, which was not selective at
all. It is interesting that the exo-cinnamyl group
underwent reduction preferentially to the endo-cinnamyl
unit in 93, furnishing a good yield of the allylic alcohol 94 (itself not reduced further), whereas the dissolved-metal
reduction produced only the fully reduced alcohol 95.47 Substrate 96 contains two cinnamyl
ethers and three allylic C–O bonds. At −2.91 V (Hg pool),
only the exocyclic cinnamyl ether is reduced to afford alcohol 97 in 78% yield.47

Figure 11 Selective reductions
of cinnamyl over allylic ethers.

Encouraged by these remarkably selective reductions, we examined
reductions of cinnamyl groups in the presence of other functionalities,
as shown in Figure 12. Thus, a selective reduction of a cinnamyl over benzyl ether was
accomplished with 98.48 The
cinnamyl group was reduced preferentially from oxygen versus nitrogen
in ether 99 and from the ester moiety in ester-amide 100.48 The use of a reticulated
vitreous carbon electrode allowed the selective reduction of the vinyl
bromide in 101, whereas both the bromine and the cinnamyl
ether were reduced at Hg-pool cathode.48 Cinnamyl carbamate was selectively deprotected over allyl carbamate
in 102 in 79% yield.48 Finally,
selective reduction of the cinnamyl group was accomplished from carbonates
versus carbamates, as shown for 103,49Figure 12.

Figure 12 Selectivity in reductions of the cinnamyl group from various substrates:
halide vs ether and oxygen vs nitrogen selectivity.

The examples shown above demonstrate that a remarkable
level of
selectivity is attainable by the use of electrochemical methods. There
is, of course, a learning curve associated with their usage and a
modest investment in equipment (potentiostat and electrodes) is required.
The practitioner needs to learn how to obtain either cyclic or linear
sweep voltammograms to gather information about the potential at which
various electrochemical events may occur [this is the electrochemist’s
equivalent of running NMR spectra of starting materials before committing
them to a reaction].

Once the response of the substrate to the
applied current or voltage
is known, preparative scale electrolysis can be performed. There are
also more sophisticated methods, such as the use of divided cells,
but the examples shown in this section have all been performed under
very simple conditions. Despite the simplicity of operation and the
excellent chemoselectivity obtained in oxidations and reductions,
electrochemistry remains on the fringes of synthetic organic chemistry.
We hope that the foregoing discussion will help convince the traditionally
minded organic chemists of the utility of electrochemical methods.

There has been some renaissance of interest in electrochemical
methods. Two recent reviews have been published by Baran, in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.50 and in Chem. Rev.51 listing various
examples as well as benefits of electrochemical transformations. The
latter review contains the word “renaissance” in the
title and is truly exhaustive, with 914(!!) references. The sentiments
expressed above related to the “activation energy” on
part of the practitioner to be willing to engage in new technologies
as well as the cost of operation are also echoed in Baran’s
reviews. His recent work on the electrochemical oxidation in the synthesis
of subglutinols A and B52 and dixiamycin
B53 represents truly exceptional examples
of creativity and efficiency in synthesis. Perhaps these disclosures
will stimulate wider interest in organic electrochemistry.

2.3 Examples of the Use of Oxidoreductase Enzymes
in Synthesis
The use of oxidoreductases in synthesis is not
as common as the use of various lipases for desymmetrization of meso
compounds or resolutions. This is likely because of two factors: first,
oxidoreductases require cofactors, and therefore working with isolated
enzymes would be prohibitively expensive, unless recycling loops are
introduced into the experimental protocol. Second, the whole-cell
transformations, in which the cofactors are provided by the life cycle
of the cell, require specialized equipment [fermentors, autoclave,
high-speed centrifuge, incubators, etc.], not readily available in
a synthetic chemistry laboratory. For these reasons, whole-cell biocatalysis
is not commonly employed in academia but is, of course, quite prevalent
in the pharmaceutical industry. There are, however, many manuals available
for the “uninitiated” organic chemist who is interested
in biocatalysis as a method of choice for asymmetric synthesis.54

2.3.1 Baker’s Yeast
Reductions
The reduction of carbonyl groups in ketoesters
and/or diketones represents
a widely used method in synthesis and is easily performed with conventional
glassware available in a synthetic laboratory.55

In the 1970s, when I was in graduate school at Rice
University, R. V. Stevens taught several “intense” courses
in synthesis (both mechanisms and design of complex molecules). He
always said to look at both sides of a functional group and/or draw
synthetic targets in several different orientations because different
ideas may transpire.

This advice constituted a major departure
from the usual teaching
of synthetic chemistry or even general organic chemistry [for example,
any chapter on esters focuses primarily on the chemistry of the carbonyl
group and not on that of the attendant alkoxide]. I have frequently
used this principle and found it extremely beneficial in both synthetic
design and the generation of new ideas.

One such idea is shown
in Figure 13 and to
my knowledge was unprecedented at the time.
Of the thousands of reported baker’s yeast reductions of ketoesters
such as 104, none were performed with substrates that
would contain a chiral center on the alkoxy portion. This was surprising
and at the same time could be exploited as a means of resolution of
the alkoxide(s), as depicted in Figure 13.

Figure 13 Principle of resolution of alkoxides containing
a chiral center.

The principle is quite
simple: in the reductions of substrates
such as 107, containing additional chiral centers on
the side chain, the level of induction diminishes with increasing
distance from the reduction site. On the other hand, the distance
from the alkoxide center to the reduction site in 109 is always constant and there was a good reason to believe that the
reduction of compounds such as 109 would provide a means
of resolving the alkoxides. Compounds 110 and 111 are NOT diastereomers; they are functionally different and are more
easily separated than stereoisomers. Following their separation, a
simple hydrolysis provides the resolved enantiomers of the alcohols 112. The results of the resolutions are shown in Figure 14. It became clear
that reasonable levels of enantiomeric excess would be available only
with alkoxides containing larger groups at the chiral carbon. Nevertheless,
these results were useful and represent, to our knowledge, the only
case where baker’s yeast reduction was used to resolve the
alkoxide portion of the ketoester.56 The
reductions were also conducted with ketoamides, as shown in Figure 14. The level of
resolution was found to depend somewhat on the steric bulk of the
substituents at the chiral center.57,58 Finally, the
reduction protocol was applied to the ketoester 131 containing
the azidodiene functionality, as shown in Figure 15.59

Figure 14 Resolution
of ketoesters and ketoamides via baker’s yeast
reductions.

Figure 15 Resolution of ketoester 131 and applications to total
synthesis of pyrrolizidine alkaloids.

Reasonable levels of resolution were attained in the intermediates 132 and 133, which furnished, after separation
and hydrolysis, the enantiomerically enriched alcohols 134 and 135. These alcohols then served as intermediates
for enantiodivergent synthesis of pyrrolizidine alkaloids.59 Finally, it was observed that at longer reaction
times, the resolved ketoester 132, containing an acidic
proton at the stereogenic center, and an enolized ketoester that can
abstract this proton intramolecularly underwent racemization and were
eventually completely converted to the single enantiomer 133, thus allowing all of the substrate mass to be converted to the
hydroxyester.59 The hydroxyester 133 does not have the internal base (enolate) and cannot racemize.
This was an important observation that made application of this methodology
useful in total synthesis.

I believe the above discussion underscores
the value of the advice
R. V. Stevens provided to his class at Rice University. No doubt there
will be future applications of the microbial processes as these are
always conducted in aqueous media and therefore are considered environmentally
friendly.

2.3.2 Use of Toluene Dioxygenase
in Synthesis
of Natural Products
The last section of this article will
highlight the use of arene cis-dihydrodiols in the
synthesis of natural products. I was very fortunate to be able to
enter this field with the help of my former Rice University classmate,
Dr Larry Kwart, who joined my group in the late 1980s and brought
the required know-how about fermentation chemistry. The concept of
this then new program was simple and is outlined in Figure 16.

Figure 16 Enzymatic dihydroxylation
of aromatic compounds by bacterial dioxygenase(s).

The transformations depicted in Figures 16 and 17 are unique
and represent one of the very few reactions [if not the only one]
for which a synthetic equivalent has not been invented.60 The combination of the enzymatic oxidation with
traditional synthetic methods led to unprecedented levels of efficiency
in many applications to the total synthesis of complex molecules.
The discovery of this unique transformation is credited to David Gibson
who isolated the first dihydrodiol61 [although
this transformation may have gone unobserved in the early 1900s62] and who later provided the robust Escherichia coli-based recombinant organisms for
large-scale whole-cell fermentation63 to
either dihydrodiols 140 or catechols 141.

Figure 17 Enzymatic dihydroxylation of aromatic compounds.

This unique methodology has gone unnoticed by organic chemists
for almost 20 years but did enter the field of synthesis in the early
1980s, and since then, many applications to enantioselective (and
enantiodivergent) synthesis of complex natural products have been
published.64

Like electrochemistry,
the whole-cell fermentation requires a moderate
investment into equipment. Sterile conditions and fermentors are required
for work with the recombinant strains on scales of 10–15L.65 However, the work with the blocked mutant strain, Pseudomonas putida 39/D, can be performed in ordinary
glassware and has been described in an Org. Synth. publication.66 The yields of metabolites
derived from good substrates (halo- and alkylbenzenes) are as high
as >30 g/L when carried out with the recombinant strains, whereas
those obtained with P. putida 39/D
yield only ∼200 mg/L. The diol derived from bromobenzene is
available from Aldrich, although the price may discourage chemists
from this commercial source [5 g of suspension in phosphate buffer,
423.5 CAD, catalog number 489492-5G]. The diols provide excellent
starting materials for enantioselective synthesis and possess rich
functional content, allowing for a variety of transformations, as
shown in Figure 18.

Figure 18 Functional content of arene dihydrodiols and access to their enantiomers.

A frequent criticism of chemoenzymatic
synthesis points out that
only one enantiomer is accessible by the use of enzymes. The diols
provide an excellent opportunity also for enantiodivergent synthesis.
This is accomplished in several ways. According to the proposed model
for the enzymatic dihydroxylation,67 because
the larger group directs the dihydroxylation, p-iodobromobenzene
provides diol 144, in which the more reactive halogen
is removed by reduction to furnish ent-146.68 Enantiodivergent synthesis is also possible
by considering symmetry of operations and the order of application
of reagents, as has been amply demonstrated on many occasions.69

Several major reviews64c,64d,64f,64g published in the last decade
provided compilations of natural products attained from the arene
metabolites and/or summaries of the development of new methodologies
by groups working in this area, primarily those of Lewis (Bath), Hudlicky
(St. Catharines), Banwell (Canberra), Boyd (Belfast), and Gonzalez
(Montevideo). Some of the recent accomplishments also take advantage
of the ipso-diols derived from benzoic acid by mutant strains,70 as shown in Figure 19. These metabolites have not been used as
frequently as those derived from arenes by toluene (and naphthalene
or biphenyl) dioxygenase(s) but a fair number of total syntheses originating
in diols such as 148 have been reported. As in the case
of toluene dioxygenase-mediated dihydroxylations, the precise mechanism
of the benzoate dioxygenase-catalyzed production of diols of type 148 remains speculative, although some details have recently
been disclosed.71

Figure 19 Metabolism of benzoic
acids by Ralstonia eutrophus.

The structures shown in Table 1 illustrate the diversity
of targets attained from
various metabolites by total synthesis. A selection of natural products
that were synthesized since ∼2010 is provided. For natural
product targets synthesized between 1987–2009, consult the
compilations published in several major reviews.64d,64f,64l,64m

Table 1 Selected Total Syntheses from Arene cis-Dihydrodiols for the Period 2010–201972−109
The observant
reader may notice that all of the targets shown in Table 1 have been attained
from only 16 different diene diol metabolites. The detailed compilation
of these diols conducted in 200464i listed
more than 400 such metabolites, obtained by dihydroxylation of arenes
by various strains. Thus, more than 96% of these compounds have yet
to find use in enantioselective synthesis! With such a large number
of homochiral compounds available and with new metabolites being isolated,
one would expect that many more applications will be forthcoming.

3 Outlook
This brief survey of four,
somewhat unconventional, methods of
organic synthesis should convince the reader of the enormous diversity
in both targets and techniques that become available when the practitioner
chooses to depart from the use of conventional methods of operation.
The techniques discussed allowed for the synthesis of hundreds of
targets that would otherwise not be attainable. With new technologies
being introduced into the mainstream portfolio of a synthetic organic
chemist, there may be few limits to the complexity of structures that
can be synthesized, especially if organic chemists learn to extend
their collaborations with biologists. Of special significance must
be the recognition of value that biology and biological techniques
offer to a synthetic chemist. The table of products that were synthesized
from the enzymatically derived diene diols illustrates well the fact
that none of these targets could have been easily reached by conventional
synthetic methodology. In agreement with the spirit of Marc Tius’s
quote,‡ it would not be an exaggeration to expect
that the future of synthetic chemistry lies almost solely in the exploitation
of biological methods. This premise will be validated (or not) by
future generations of practitioners who do not fear venturing outside
of their comfort zones and are willing to learn new things.

‡ Quote from Marc Tius in an
account on The Quest for a Practical Synthesis of Morphine Alkaloids
and Their Derivatives by Chemoenzymatic Methods by Hudlicky, T.; Reed,
J. W. Acc. Chem. Res. 2015, 48, 674–687: “Consider that if you
could resurrect an organic chemist from 100 years ago, he would recognize
most of the glassware in the lab, and once he spent a month reading
about transition metal reagents and a few other novelties from the
past 50 years he could understand pretty much everything we are doing,
because the goals of organic synthesis have scarcely changed in a
century. Now think about performing the same thought experiment with
a biologist. The biologist of 100 years ago would be completely mystified
by today’s biology. Organic synthesis either finds its mojo
again or this branch of chemistry as we know it and practice it will
be extinct.” Marc Tius, October 2014.

(Wiley-VCH, 2007). The following speculation has been advanced to
explain the presence of Pbo in the Vycor column after pyrolysis:
