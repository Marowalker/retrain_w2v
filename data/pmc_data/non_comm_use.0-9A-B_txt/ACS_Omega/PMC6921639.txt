Sodium lignosulfonate is a polymer with extensive sources
and abundant
functional groups. Therefore, it has potential value for research
and wide utilization. In this study, the adsorption material was prepared
by blending sodium lignosulfonate and chitosan, which could adsorb
anionic and cationic dyes and metal ions. The composite was characterized
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetry (TG). The results showed that
the composite was cross-linked mainly by the strong electrostatic
interaction between the protonated amino group in chitosan and the
sulfonate group in sodium lignosulfonate. Moreover, the effects of
initial concentration, adsorption time, initial pH, and mass ratio
of chitosan to sodium lignosulfonate on the adsorption performance
of the composite were investigated. Meanwhile, the adsorption processes
were agreed well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir
isotherm model. The adsorption mechanism was that the electrostatic
interaction between the protonated amino and hydroxyl groups of the
composite with anionic (SO3–) and HCrO4– groups of Congo red and Cr(VI), respectively.
In addition, the electrostatic interaction between SO3– of the composite and positively charged group of Rhodamine
B played an important role in the adsorption of Rhodamine B.

1 Introduction
The wastewater from dyestuff,
electroplating, textile and other
industries contain dyes, heavy-metal ions, and other harmful chemicals,
causing water contamination.1,2 The dyes in wastewater
are harmful to aquatic organisms and affect the aesthetics because
of their high toxicity and high visibility.3,4 Rhodamine
B and Congo red as typical dyes are widely used in many industries,
which have to be removed from wastewater due to their carcinogenic
and mutagenic effects.5,6 Similarly, Cr(VI), derived from
various industries such as electroplating, textile, storage batteries,
and leather tanning, is non-biodegradable and highly toxic, posing
a serious threat to human health.7,8 To remove these
contaminants, various techniques have been developed, including adsorption,9,10 membrane filtration,11 catalytic degradation,12,13 electrochemical process,14 advanced oxidation
process,11 etc. Among them, adsorption
has potential application prospect due to its high efficiency, economic
feasibility, and convenient operation. Various adsorption materials
have been reported for the removal of pollutants such as polymers,15 inorganic materials,16 biomaterials,17−19 and macromolecular materials.20 In recent years, biomaterials have become the concern of
materials, owing to environmental protection, renewability, and high
removal efficiency for pollutants.

Lignin, the second most abundant
organic compound, is a kind of
macromolecular polymer with three-dimensional network structure.21,22 Although lignin is abundant, it is rarely used as a raw material
in industrial production due to its complex molecular structure.23 Therefore, the effective utilization of lignin
is very meaningful and promising. Due to its phenolic hydroxyl, alcoholic
hydroxyl, and carboxyl, lignin could be used as an adsorbent to adsorb
dyes and metal ions.11,24 However, it has been shown that
the adsorption property of lignin was poor in previous researches.25 Therefore, many studies focused on its modification
to improve its adsorption capacity.26

Chitosan, the only natural polysaccharide with amino group, is
obtained from deacetylation of chitin, which widely exists in nature.27 It is a linear natural polymer composed of β(1,4)-2-amino-2-deoxygen-d-dextran and β(1,4)-2-acetylamino-2-deoxygen-d-dextran. Chitosan could adsorb pollutants on account of its active
sites including amino and hydroxyl groups.28 It could improve the adsorption performance of other materials by
cross-linking. Therefore, development of chitosan–lignin composites
is a good way to improve the adsorption properties of lignin.

Some studies prepared chitosan–lignin composites by solvent
evaporation,29 blending method,30 and layer-by-layer self-assembly.31 Due to their excellent properties, the composites
have a wide range of applications in the fields of cosmetics, biomedicine,32 biology,33 and others.
However, only a few studies have reported its application in sewage
treatment. Sohni et al.34 fabricated a
chitosan/nanolignin composite material as a highly efficient adsorbent,
and its adsorption results demonstrated efficient removal ratio (about
83%) of methylene blue dye. Nair35 reported
the adsorption of the chitosan–alkali lignin composite for
Remazol Brilliant Blue R and Cr(VI) and found that it had the highest
removal percentage of pollutants compared to chitosan and alkali lignin.
Wysokowski et al.36 developed the chitin–lignin
adsorbent with a high adsorption efficiency of nickel(II) and cadmium(II)
(88.0 and 98.4%, respectively). The findings from these studies illustrated
that the composites had the ability to adsorb dyes and metal ions.
However, a composite that can adsorb heavy-metal ions, anionic dyes,
and cationic dyes has not been fully investigated in previous studies.

As the main form of lignin, lignosulfonate has sulfonate groups,
derived from sulfite pulping process, which is a polyanionic electrolyte
with good water solubility.37,38 The present study prepared
the chitosan–lignosulfonate composite and explored its molecular
structure, synthesis mechanism, thermal stability, and surface morphology.
Also, it was the first time to comprehensively investigate its adsorption
performance of Congo red (anionic dye), Rhodamine B (cationic dye),
and Cr(VI) (metal ion). Moreover, the change of adsorption active
sites in the composite was skillfully studied through analyzing the
effect of different mass ratios between chitosan and lignosulfonate
on the adsorption capacities for different pollutants. The adsorption
kinetics and adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted. Finally,
the adsorption mechanism of the composite on pollutants was revealed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Chitosan–Lignosulfonate
Composites
2.1.1 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FT-IR) Analysis
The FT-IR spectra of sodium lignosulfonate,
chitosan, and the composite are shown in Figure 1. For sodium lignosulfonate, the peaks at
3420 and 2932 cm–1 were due to the stretching vibrations
of −OH and C–H, respectively. The peaks at 1594 and
1419 cm–1 were associated with C–C stretching
in aromatic rings.39 The peak at 1113 cm–1 represented the C–O–C stretching vibration
in the methoxy group. The peak at 1036 cm–1 corresponding
to S=O stretching indicated the existence of sulfonate groups.40

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of sodium lignosulfonate, chitosan, and
chitosan–lignosulfonate
composite.

In chitosan, the broad peaks at 3447–3391
cm–1 were attributed to the stretching of O–H
and N–H bonds.41 The peaks at 2890
and 1614 cm–1 were assigned to stretching vibrations
of C–H in the alkyl
group and N–H in the amino group, respectively. The peak at
1169 cm–1 was related to the C–O stretching.42 The peak at 667 cm–1 was due
to the out-of-plane bending of the O–H group.

After compounding
sodium lignosulfonate with chitosan, it could
be observed that the FT-IR spectra of the composite had all the key
characteristics of sodium lignosulfonate and chitosan with some small
changes due to the weak interaction between the two materials. In
composite, the peaks of N–H stretching moved from 1614 cm–1 (in chitosan) to 1594 cm–1 and
the peak at 1036 cm–1, similar to that of sodium
lignosulfonate, was attributed to S=O stretching.43 It could be inferred that −NH2 was protonated into −NH3+, and there
was electrostatic interaction between −NH3+ and −SO3–. The shifts of C–O
stretching peak from 1169 cm–1 (in chitosan) to
1155 cm–1 and C–O–C peak from 1113
cm–1 (in sodium lignosulfonate) to 1064 cm–1 were clearly observed. The results suggested that the hydrogen bonding
existed between the hydroxyl group in sodium lignosulfonate and the
glucosidic bond in chitosan, and there was the interaction between
the hydroxyl group in chitosan and the ether bond in sodium lignosulfonate.29

According to the FT-IR characterization,
the interactions in the
chitosan–lignosulfonate composite are depicted as Scheme 1, including weak
hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interaction. A weak bond was formed
between hydroxyl group of chitosan and methoxy group of sodium lignosulfonate
(shown as dashed line 1 in Scheme 1). Also, the hydroxyl group in the phenolic ring of
sodium lignosulfonate could also interact with β-1,4-glycosidic
oxygen in chitosan (dashed line 2). It could be seen that the electrostatic
interaction existed between the protonated amino group in chitosan
and the sulfonate group in the sodium lignosulfonate (dashed line
3).

Scheme 1 Preparation of Chitosan–Sodium Lignosulfonate Composite
2.1.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermalgravimetric
analysis (TGA) curves describe the trend of material degradation with
an increase in temperature and characterize the thermal stability
of materials. The thermogravimetric curves of chitosan, sodium lignosulfonate,
and chitosan–lignosulfonate composite are shown in Figure 2. The thermal degradation
of chitosan, sodium lignosulfonate, and the composite proceeded in
two stages. In the first stage, chitosan was obviously weightless
around 100 °C, while the weight loss of sodium lignosulfonate
and chitosan–lignosulfonate composite occurred at around 150
°C, indicating the evaporation of water absorbed in materials.44 In the second stage, there was the degradation
of three materials. It was clear that chitosan degraded in the range
of 250–410 °C owing to the breaking of the molecular chain,
and sodium lignosulfonate decomposed in a wide temperature range of
150–500 °C due to the volatilization of low-molecular-weight
lignin fragments.45 The composite degraded
in the temperature range of 250–410 °C, which might be
related with pyrolysis of chitosan molecular chains and lignosulfonate.

Figure 2 Thermogravimetric
curves of chitosan, sodium lignosulfonate, and
chitosan–lignosulfonate composite.

Comparing the degradation ranges of the three materials,
it was
found that the weight loss of the composite was merely about 40% in
the temperature range of 250–410 °C and the weight loss
rate of the composite was higher than that of chitosan and lower than
that of sodium lignosulfonate. It was indicated that the degradation
rate of the composite was reduced by the addition of sodium lignosulfonate.
The weight loss of composite was higher than that of sodium lignosulfonate
and lower than that of chitosan at 800 °C, proving that the composite
had the corresponding binding region of sodium lignosulfonate and
chitosan.34

2.1.3 Surface Morphology Analysis
The
surface morphologies of sodium lignosulfonate, chitosan, and the composite
are shown in Figure 3. It could be found from Figure 3a that the surface of sodium lignosulfonate was rough
with some folds and holes. As seen from Figure 3b, chitosan presented an uneven network structure
and had many pores with different sizes, which were mainly due to
the interlacing of the molecular chains of chitosan. As seen in Figure 3c, these cross sections
of molecular chains were arranged neatly and distributed evenly, which
might be the molecular chains of chitosan cross-linking with sodium
lignosulfonate. It was speculated that the ordered arrangement of
chitosan molecular chains was due to the strong electrostatic interaction
between sodium lignosulfonate and chitosan.

composite of adsorbing Cr(VI); (e) chitosan–lignosulfonate
composite of adsorbing Rhodamine B; and (f) chitosan–lignosulfonate
composite of adsorbing Congo red.

The surface morphology of the Cr(VI)-adsorbed composite
is shown
in Figure 3d. It was
found that the composite after adsorption for Cr(VI) had a more dense
surface and was caked, which indicated that Cr(VI) was fully adsorbed
by the composite. Also, it could be observed from Figure 3e that the surface of composite
was smoother and some clumps appeared, which manifested that the composite
adsorbed Rhodamine B. Figure 3c shows that the composite after adsorption for Congo red
had a more uniform surface with small holes, which illustrated that
Congo red could be adsorbed by the composite and was mainly adsorbed
on the surface of the composite.

2.1.4 Elemental Analysis
Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of chitosan–lignosulfonate composite
and pollutants-adsorbed chitosan–lignosulfonate composite is
shown in Figure 4.
Cr element was found in the Cr-adsorbed composite, indicating that
Cr was adsorbed by composite. After the adsorption of Rhodamine B,
the atomic percentages of C and O in the composite changed from 54.77
to 59.72 and from 37.36 to 33.28, respectively, which validated that
the composite adsorbed Rhodamine B. The atomic percentages of N and
S had a noticeable increase after adsorbing Congo red by composite,
which fully proved that the composite had the ability to absorb Congo
red.

and (d) chitosan–lignosulfonate composite of adsorbing Congo
red.

2.2 Effect of Mass Ratio
The mass ratio
of sodium lignosulfonate and chitosan had a great effect on the adsorption
performance of the composite. The adsorption capacity of the composites
with different proportions for pollutants is shown in Figure 5. The adsorption amount of
Congo red showed a gradual increasing trend with an increase in chitosan
(with amino group). Congo red (anionic dye) could be adsorbed through
electrostatic interaction between its anion group and the protonated
amino group in the composite.3 The result
indicated that the reason for the rising adsorption amount of Congo
red was the increase of protonated amino groups in the composite.

Figure 5 Adsorption
amount of Cr(VI) and Rhodamine B and Congo red by the
chitosan–lignosulfonate composite with different mass ratios
(inset: the amount of adsorption sites on the chitosan–lignosulfonate
composite at different mass ratios).

It also could be observed that the adsorption amount
of Rhodamine
B decreased with the increase in chitosan. Absorption of Rhodamine
B (cationic dye) on the composite was due to the electrostatic interaction
and the formation of hydrogen bonds.46 It
could be inferred that the decreased adsorption amount of Rhodamine
B was due to the reduction of sulfonic groups and hydroxyl groups
in the composite.

In addition, the adsorption amount of Cr(VI)
tended to decline
with the reduction of mass ratio. At a pH of 2, Cr(VI) existed predominantly
in the form of HCrO4– and the amino and
hydroxyl groups in the composite were fully protonated to form the
positively charged groups, resulting in the electrostatic interaction
between HCrO4– and the composite.47,48 It was speculated that the reduction of the hydroxyl group was higher
than the increase of the amino group as the chitosan increased.

As seen in Figure 5, it is clear that the adsorption amount of the composite for the
pollutants followed the order: Congo red > Cr(VI) > Rhodamine
B. However,
the adsorption sites of the composite for Cr(VI) were more than that
for Congo red from the inset in Figure 5. It was because (i) the molecular weight of Cr(VI)
was lower than that of Congo red and (ii) the adsorption of Cr(VI)
included not only the electrostatic interaction but also hydrogen
bonding interaction. With an increase in chitosan, the amount of free
amino groups increased and the number of the free sulfonic groups
and hydroxyl groups declined in the composite. It proved that the
preparation mechanism of the composite was consistent with the result
of FT-IR.

2.3 Adsorption Dyes and Cr(VI) on the Pollutants
2.3.1 Effect of pH
The pH of the solution
is an important parameter affecting the adsorption amount of pollutants.
It determines the level of electrostatic adsorption between adsorbent
and adsorbate. Under different initial pH conditions, the adsorption
amounts of the composite for Cr(VI), Congo red, and Rhodamine B are
shown in Figure 6.
As seen from Figure 6a, the adsorption amount of the composite for Cr(VI) decreased drastically
with increase in the pH value within the range of 2–8. When
the pH value was higher, the trend of decrease tended to be stable.
It was clear that the adsorption of the composite was pH dependent.
Cr(VI) exists predominantly in the form of HCrO4– ions in the aqueous solution below pH of 4, while this form transfers
to CrO42– and Cr2O72– anions with an increase of pH.47 At the pH below 4, the composite was fully protonated with
a surface full of positive charge, which facilitated the electrostatic
interaction between the composite and HCrO4–. The decrease of the adsorption amount could be explained by the
competition of the anions (CrO42–, Cr2O72–) and OH– in the composite.49 In addition, the
amount of positive charge on the composite surface reduced due to
the deprotonation of functional groups with the increase of pH value.
Therefore, Cr(VI) solution with a pH of 2.0 was selected for adsorption
experiments.

Figure 6 Effect of the initial pH on the adsorption of (a) Cr(VI),
(b) Rhodamine
B, and (c) Congo red.

The adsorption of dyes is greatly affected by the
pH of the solution.
From Figure 6b, it
can be clearly seen that a slight increase in the adsorption capacity
for Rhodamine B occurred with an increase in pH from 2 to 7, mainly
due to the protonation of composite at a low pH value. There were
some positive charges on the surface, and the adsorption of cationic
dye molecules was inhibited. When the pH was increased, the number
of positively charged groups in composite decreased due to the increase
of OH– and deprotonation of functional groups. Thus,
the adsorption ability of the composite for Rhodamine (cationic dye)
was enhanced. As the pH increased from 7 to 10, the decline of the
adsorption amount was due to the agglomeration of Rhodamine B, which
hindered the adsorption for the dye.50

As shown in Figure 6c, the adsorption amount went up with an increase of the pH and reached
the maximum at pH 7. It was indicated that the surface of composite
was positively charged owing to the protonation of amine and hydroxyl
groups and the electrostatic attraction occurred between the composite
and Congo red at a low pH value. The adsorption capacity showed a
decreasing trend at higher pH, which could be clarified by the fact
that the negative charge on the surface of the composite was not conducive
to the adsorption of Congo red due to electrostatic repulsion. Therefore,
the adsorption system with a pH of 7 was chosen for further adsorption
experiments for Congo red.

2.3.2 Adsorption Kinetics
The effect
of contact time on the adsorption of pollutants by the composite is
shown in Figure 7a.
The adsorbed amount of Cr(VI) increased rapidly within 25 min, and
then the upward tendency was steady until reaching an equilibrium
state. In addition, the adsorbed amount of Rhodamine B on the composite
showed a rapidly rising trend within 40 min, and then the uptake rate
decreased distinctly after 100 min. Among the three pollutants, the
adsorption capacity of Congo red on composite was the highest. The
adsorption amount increased obviously within 100 min, and then the
increasing rate decreased slowly.

Figure 7 (a) Effect of adsorption time on the adsorption
amount of chitosan–lignosulfonate
composite for Cr(VI), Rhodamine B and Congo red; (b) pseudo-second-order
kinetic model.

The pseudo-first-order model and the pseudo-second-order
model
were used to describe the adsorption process. The equations are given
as follows (eqs 1 and 2, respectively):51 First-order kinetic
model:
1   Second-order kinetic model:
2  where qe (mg/g)
and qt (mg/g) are the
amounts adsorbed at equilibrium and at the time t (min), respectively; k1 (min–1) and k2 (g/mg/min) are the pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order constants, respectively.52,53

From Figure 7b,
it is observed that the kinetics of adsorption for different pollutants
was best described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The kinetic
model parameters and the correlation coefficients are shown in Table 1. It could be found
that the correlation coefficient of the second-order kinetic model
was higher than that of the first-order kinetic model, and the maximum
adsorption in the second-order kinetic model was matched well with
the experimental data. It was indicated that the second-order kinetic
model was more consistent with the adsorption process of the three
pollutants and the adsorption rates of pollutants were controlled
by chemical adsorption.54,55

Table 1 Kinetic Model Parameters for the Adsorption
of Cr(VI), Rhodamine B, and Congo Red
 	pseudo-first-order	pseudo-second-order	
pollutant	qe (mg/g)	k1 (min–1)	R2	qe (mg/g)	k2 (g/mg/min)	R2	
Cr(VI)	64.51	0.2378	0.9466	68.97	0.0027	0.9994	
Rhodamine B	34.69	0.0850	0.9372	38.17	0.0027	0.9987	
Congo red	240.33	0.0229	0.9496	285.71	0.0001	0.9927	
2.3.3 Adsorption Isotherm
It is well
known that the adsorption capacity is greatly affected by the concentration
of the pollutants. The effect of the concentration on the adsorption
of the composite for pollutants is shown in Figure 8. It could be found that the adsorption amount
of pollutants enhanced with an increase in the initial concentration.
And then, it tended to be a stable state after a certain concentration.
The reason was mainly that the amplification of the concentration
would facilitate the diffusion of pollutants to the surface of the
adsorption material.56 Eventually, the
adsorption of pollutants reached a saturated state at a certain concentration.

Figure 8 Fitting
of the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Tempkin isotherm models
to the adsorption experiment of (a) Cr(VI), (b) Rhodamine B, and (c)
Congo red on the composite.

Three equilibrium isotherm models were used to
describe the adsorption
process successfully. The Langmuir isotherm model assumes that the
adsorption takes place on a single molecular layer and there is no
interaction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent. The Freundlich
isotherm model is suitable for a heterogeneous multilayer adsorption
process.57 The Tempkin isotherm shows that
the increase of heat in the adsorption process is linear when the
interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent is not considered, and
it is appropriate for heterogeneous multilayer adsorption. The three
isotherms are calculated by the following eqs 3–5, respectively45,58 Langmuir isotherm:
3   Freundlich isotherm:
4   Tempkin isotherm:
5  where Ce (mg/L)
is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate in the solution; KL (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant related to
the maximum adsorption capacity and the energy of adsorption; qmax (mg/g) is the saturated adsorption capacity; KF is the Freundlich constant of the adsorption
capacity; 1/n is a parameter related to the adsorption
strength; b (J/mol) is the heat of adsorption; and A is the isothermal constant related to adsorption.35,59

The adsorption isotherm parameters are shown in Table 2. It was observed that the Langmuir
model was the best model to simulate the adsorption of the two dyes
with the highest correlation coefficient among the three models. It
was indicated that adsorbing the two dyes on the composite was a homogeneous
adsorption covering a single surface, which was mainly a chemical
adsorption process. The Tempkin model best matched the adsorption
process of Cr(VI), which indicated that the adsorption heat and temperature
of the composite presented a well linear relationship in the adsorption
process. However, the correlation coefficient in Langmuir reached
0.99, which is higher than that in Freundlich. This proved that the
adsorption was mainly a chemical process and the surface of the composite
had adsorption sites with homogeneous adsorption energy. Moreover,
the Freundlich constant (1/n) represented the intensity
of adsorption, which meant 0.1 < 1/n ≤
0.5 was quite easy to adsorb; 0.5 < 1/n ≤
1 was easy to adsorb; and 1/n > 1 was difficult
to
adsorb.60 Hence, for Rhodamine B and Cr(VI),
the values of 1/n were lower than 0.7, indicating
the adsorption was easy. In addition, the adsorption of Congo red
was the easiest with 1/n of 0.4053. Combined with
the maximum adsorption amount in the adsorption process, it could
be concluded that the composite had the best adsorption capacity on
Congo red among the three pollutants.

2.4 Adsorption Mechanism
According to
the above analysis, the adsorption mechanism of the composite on the
Congo red, Rhodamine B, and Cr(VI) is proposed and shown as Scheme 2. It was clear that
the electrostatic interaction between the protonated amino groups
of the composite and the anions (SO3–) of the Congo red played a main role in Congo red adsorption. The
adsorption mechanism of Rhodamine B by the composite was as follows:
(i) electrostatic interaction between the anion group (SO3–) of the composite and the positively charged
group of the Rhodamine B and (ii) the weak hydrogen bond between the
carboxyl of Rhodamine B and methoxy group of the composite.43 Cr(VI) existed in the form of HCrO4– under acidic conditions, which was adsorbed due
to the electrostatic interaction between protonated amine and hydroxyl
groups of the composite and the HCrO4– anion.61 Based on the above reactions,
it could be seen that the type and number of adsorption sites in chitosan–lignosulfonate
had increased significantly. It was indicated that the chitosan–lignosulfonate
composite could be an excellent adsorbent for anionic and cationic
dyes and metal ions.

Cr(VI) Adsorption on Composite
3 Conclusions
In this work, chitosan–lignosulfonate
composite was successfully
prepared by using a simple blending method. It was found that the
composite was cross-linked by weak hydrogen bond and electrostatic
interaction. Functional groups, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic
interactions in composites enhanced surface and chemical properties
of the composite than chitosan and sodium lignosulfonate. The results
showed that the mass ratio of chitosan to sodium lignosulfonate, the
initial concentration of pollutants, and the contact time had great
effects on the adsorption capacity of the composite. Moreover, it
revealed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was matched well
with the adsorption kinetics of pollutants on the composite and the
adsorption isotherm could be fitted well with the Langmuir model.
In addition, the mechanism of adsorption was presented by analyzing
the surface characterization of the composite, which were electrostatic
interaction and weak hydrogen bond between the composite and the pollutants.
The composite could adsorb both anionic and cationic dyes and had
an excellent adsorption capacity for Cr(VI). Therefore, the study
of sodium chitosan–lignosulfonate composite has potential value
in sewage treatment.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Sodium lignosulfonate (C20H24Na2O10S2,
MW 534.51 g/mol, 96%), chitosan (C6nH11nNO4n, 95% deacetylated,
viscosity 100–200 mPa s), Rhodamine B (C28H31ClN2O3, MW 479.01 g/mol, AR), and Congo
red (C32H22N6Na2O6S2, MW 696.66 g/mol, BS) were obtained from Shanghai
Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7, MW 294.18 g/mol, GR) was provided by Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Acetic acid (CH3COOH, MW 60.05
g/mol, AR) was purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. In addition,
all other solutions were prepared by distilled water. All chemicals
in the experiments were used without further purification.

4.2 Preparation of Chitosan–Lignosulfonate
Composite
A certain quantity of sodium lignosulfonate was
added to 30 mL of distilled water and stirred well. Chitosan was dissolved
in 30 mL of aqueous acetic acid (1% v/v). The sodium lignosulfonate
solution was dropped into chitosan solution and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently,
the composite was vacuum filtered and then dried at room temperature
for 48 h. Finally, the composite was ground into powder. The mass
ratios of lignosulfonate to chitosan were 10:1, 10:2, 10:3, 10:4,
10:5, 10:6, 10:7, 10:8, 10:9, and 1:1. To establish the adsorption
models of the composite, a further experiment of the composite (10:3)
was conducted.

4.3 Characterization
Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was taken on a Spectrum 100
(PerkinElmer, England) FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400
cm–1 using KBr disk method. Thermalgravimetric analysis
(TGA) was carried on a TGA2050 analyzer (TA Instruments Ltd.) from
25 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen
atmosphere. The morphologies and structures of the composite, chitosan,
and sodium lignosulfonate were characterized by a JSM-6700F (JEOL
Ltd., Japan) field-emission scanning electron microscope. An UV-5100
(Metash Instruments Ltd., China) spectrometer was utilized for measuring
the adsorption capacity of pollutants. Energy-dispersive X-ray analyses
(EDAX) of the composites and pollutant-adsorbed composites were performed
by JEOL JSM-7610F field-emission scanning electron microscope.

4.4 Adsorption Experiment
Effect of mass
ratio: 20 mL of 100 mg/L Cr(VI) solution was mixed with 0.02 g composites
of different mass ratios and then shocked at 25 °C for 24 h at
150 rpm. Rhodamine B solution (100 mg/L) and Congo red solution (1
g/L) were also subjected to same adsorption experiments as described
above.

Effect of pH: the initial pH value of the solution was
adjusted using 1 mol/L HCl and 1 mol/L NaOH. Twenty milliliters of
pollutant solution with different pH values was mixed with 0.02 g
of composites and shocked at 25 °C for 24 h at 150 rpm.

Adsorption kinetics: the kinetic studies were conducted through
adding 0.02 g of composite (10:3) into 20 mL of pollutant solutions
including Cr(VI) solution (100 mg/L), Rhodamine B solution (100 mg/L),
and Congo red solution (1 g/L). Afterward, the solution was shaken
at 25 °C, 150 rpm, and different time intervals of 5–300
min.

Adsorption isotherm: the isotherm experiments were carried
out
via putting 0.02 g of composite (10:3) in 20 mL of Cr(VI) solution,
Rhodamine B solution, and Congo red solution with different concentrations
from 200 to 350, 100–400, and 550–950 mg/L, respectively.
Subsequently, the adsorption solution was dispersed at 25 °C
for 24 h at 150 rpm.

The pH of Cr(VI) solution was adjusted
to 2. Also, the concentration
of the pollutant solution was determined by a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Cr(VI) concentration was measured at 540 nm using 1,5-diphenyl carbazide
as the complexing agent.5 The concentrations
of Rhodamine B and Congo red were measured in absorbance of the peaks
at 554 and 497 nm, respectively. The adsorption capacity (qe) was calculated by the following equation 6 6  where C0 (mg/L)
and Ce (mg/L) are the initial concentration
and the equilibrium concentration after adsorption, respectively; W (mg) is the dosage of the composite; and V (L) is the volume of the solution.
