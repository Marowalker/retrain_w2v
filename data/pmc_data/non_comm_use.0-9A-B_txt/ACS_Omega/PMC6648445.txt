In this study, a new heterobimetallic Mo(VI)–V(V) organosilicon
Schiff base complex has been prepared and characterized by different
techniques, such as FTIR, Raman, MS, ICP-AES, TGA, and XPS. The bimetallic
nanocomplex, revealed by TEM images, showed high oxidation stability
and desired activity in the aerobic oxidation of a structurally diverse
set of benzylic alcohols in ethanol as a safe solvent. Further, oxidation
of benzylic hydrocarbons successfully occurred, producing the target
compounds in high yields and excellent selectivities. Our results
demonstrated a cooperative effect between Mo(VI) and V(V) as redox
active sites in an organosilicon Schiff base framework. A facile and
practical reusability of the solid catalyst at the end of the reaction
was observed.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, the development of new synthetic strategies that take green
chemistry into consideration has become a very imperative topic. Because
catalysis can be considered as one of the central themes in green
chemistry,1−3 optimizations
of existing chemical transformations associated with the development
of practical and environmentally friendly processes depend appreciably
on the improvement of catalyst performance. In particular, transition-metal-based
catalysts render an effective manner to achieve the optimal conditions
in terms of high efficiency and selectivity of the processes.4−6 Nature as a provenance of specific
and highly efficient catalysts containing two or more metal centers
in the active site has long been definitely well-known.7,8 In this context, inspired by it, several research groups have developed
multimetallic catalytic systems for various organic and bioorganic
transformations.9−12 Cooperative and synergistic benefits together
with these processes further enhance their potential to high performance.

Recently, bimetallic complexes have attracted extensive investigations
into their synthesis and development in catalysis.13−18 In general, incorporating
multiple metal centers into a single ligand structure can promote
reactivity and selectivity.19 Also, the
ability to orchestrate with other catalytic modes in a complementary
pathway is arguably attributed to the development of these robust
complexes.20−22 On the other
hand, the properties of bimetallic catalysts are significantly different
from their related monometallic systems, which accrued from the “synergistic”
effects.23,24 Nevertheless, it would be interesting to
include such compounds in considering assays because of the potentially
superior performance of bimetallic catalysts as compared to their
monometallic counterparts.

Owning to their varied characteristics
and tunable compositions, they are intensely used in a variety of
applications as catalytic reforming reactions,25 adsorbents,26 pollution control,27 and valuable conversions.28−31 Despite these
priorities, most of the bimetallic complexes are still limited to
noble metals, including Pd, Pt, Au, Ru, and Rh, which are costly and
unavailable.32−36 Therefore,
to achieve the full potential of this strategy, exploitation of more
naturally abundant metals deserves future attention. So, it is of
great interest to improve the understanding and design of novel heterogeneous
bimetallic catalysts.

Selective oxidation reactions as a significant
class of clean chemical transformations have been extensively used
in the synthetic organic chemistry at both laboratorial and industrial
levels.37,38 Although there are widespread means of achieving
this conversion, typically most of them rely on the use of hazardous
terminal oxidants or cause the generation of by-products. With a view
to tackling problems for such oxidations and due to environmental
concerns, more sustainable chemical processes have been promoted.39−41 Today, a clean and environmentally
friendly process using environmentally benign oxidants, such as oxygen,
which is among the cheaper and lesser polluting stoichiometric oxidants,
is preferred.42−45 Therefore, the use of a catalytic system
with implementation of a transition-metal-based catalyst in combination
with oxygen as an alternative oxidant would potentially lead to significant
improvements over many existing systems. Molybdenum complexes have
attracted considerable interest, especially as catalysts for oxidation
reactions in recent years.46−48 However, as far as we know, only a few reports have described the
catalytic activity of molybdenum-based bimetallic catalysts in oxidation
reactions.49−51 Besides, Mo
is a well-known multivalent element, which is predicted to display
very close redox potentials to vanadium. Therefore, we developed a
Mo–V bimetallic complex for the aerobic oxidation transformation.

In view of the above and in continuation of our interest in exploring
green oxidation methods,52−58 herein, we
wish to describe an efficient aerobic benzylic C–H oxidation
to the corresponding carbonyl compounds using a Mo(VI)–V(V)
bimetallic nanocomplex containing an organosilane Schiff base ligand
(HL). The nanocomplex could be readily recovered and reused five times
without significant loss of its catalytic activity (Scheme 1).

Bimetallic Nanocomplex
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Catalyst
Just recently, we have reported the synthesis
of a new organosilicon aldehyde from the oxidation of (3-chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane
and used it as an appropriate linker for designing new heterogeneous
catalysts through formation of the imine bond, generating a new HL
(Supporting Information).52 When we added Mo and VO acetate salts to the ethanolic
solution of the title HL under ultrasonic agitation, a new heterobimetallic
Mo(IV)–V(V) nanocomplex was acquired (Scheme 2), which is the subject of this work.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of the Mo(IV)–V(V) Bimetallic
Nanocomplex
ICP-AES analysis revealed that the contents of Mo and V are 0.35
and 0.089 wt %, respectively. The FTIR spectrum of the bimetallic
Mo(VI)–V(V) nanocomplex (Figure 1) reveals the presence of major bands at 802, 908,
and 862 cm–1, which are attributed to the stretching
vibrations of V–O groups as a bridge59 and the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the cis-MoO2 moiety.60 The peaks at 2955 and 1442 cm–1 are related to
the C–H stretching vibration of methylene groups. Evidently,
the peak at 1665 cm–1 can be assigned to the C=N
stretching mode of the imine bond. The absorption bands at 1127–1142
cm–1 correspond to the Si–O bond.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of the Mo(IV)–V(V)
bimetallic nanocomplex.

More
evidence for the integrity of this structure was obtained by the Raman
spectrum. The bimetallic nanocomplex exhibited four main vibration
modes in 647, 806, 862, and 910 cm–1 (Figure 2). The peak at 806 cm–1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of V–O groups
as a bridge.59 The absorption bands at
862 and 910 cm–1 can be assigned to the symmetric
and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the cis-MoO2, respectively. The most intense peak at 647 cm–1 may be assigned to the stretching of the Mo–O–V
bond.

Mo(IV)–V(V) bimetallic
nanocomplex.

To investigate the surface chemical composition and chemical
state of elements in the bimetallic Mo(VI)–V(V) complex, XPS
measurements were carried out in the region from 0 to 1100 eV and
calibrated on the basis of C 1s (285 eV) (Figure 3). The respective peaks for Si 2p, Mo 3d,
N 1s, V 2p, and O 1s confirmed the presence of these elements in the
prepared complex (Figure 3a). From Figure 3b, the spectra of Mo species were seen to exhibit two peaks at 233
and 235.8 eV, which correspond to the characteristic signals of Mo(VI).61 The observed peak at 517.4 eV (Figure 3c) was assigned to VO(V) species,
in terms of the V 2p3/2 orbital. Furthermore, the peak
at a binding energy of 522.1 eV was attributed to the V 2p1/2 orbital.62

complex; (b) Mo 3d; (c) V 2p.

TEM observations clearly
revealed a semispherical morphology for the title bimetallic complex
with sizes ranging between 75 and 93 nm (Figure 4).

of the Mo(VI)–V(V) bimetallic
nanocomplex.

To study the stability of the bimetallic
complex against temperature, the TGA experiment was performed from
room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
As can be seen in Figure 5, the nanocomplex started to degrade at 343 °C, which
indicates the desired stability of the catalyst. The organic parts
decomposed completely at 643 °C.

XRD was employed to investigate
the crystallinity of the prepared complex, and a wide peak at 2θ
about 20° demonstrated well an amorphous structure as depicted
in Figure 6.

2.2 Catalytic Activity
Initially, blank experiments were performed under O2 (1
atm) for the oxidation of 1-phenyl ethanol (1 mmol) as a model substrate
using NHPI (N-hydroxy phthalimide) in ethanol (2
mL). No product was observed in the absence of catalyst or NHPI, even
after 12 h of stirring under reflux conditions. Then, the catalytic
activities of MoO2(acac)2 and VO(acac)2 salts and molybdenum and vanadyl Schiff base complexes as monometallic
complexes were examined at the same reaction and conditions. The results
presented in Figure 7 clearly showed the superiority of the title Mo(VI)–V(V) bimetallic
nanocomplex than the other catalysts for the oxidation of 1-phenyl
ethanol.

Figure 7 Comparison
of oxidation
of 1-phenyl ethanol (1 mmol) in the presence of NHPI (0.1 mmol) in
EtOH (2 mL) by various catalysts at 75 °C under O2 (1 atm) after 2 h.

Afterward, to achieve the standard condition for this
reaction, different factors were evaluated, such as the nature and
amount of solvent, temperature, oxidant nature, and the quantity of
NHPI or catalyst. The schematic examination can be found in Figure 8. The results in Figure 8a recommended EtOH
as a green solvent enabling the reaction to proceed faster than those
in MeCN, EtOAc, and solvent-free conditions. Also, the reaction did
not proceed in water. Further investigation demonstrated an improvement
in the reaction yield by reducing the solvent amount to 0.5 mL and
increasing the temperature to 75 °C (Figure 8b,c).

Figure 8 Screening of (a) solvent
nature [catalyst (0.013
g), NHPI (0.1 mmol), temperature (75 °C)], (b) solvent amount
[catalyst (0.013 g), NHPI (0.1 mmol), temperature (75 °C)], (c)
temperature [catalyst (0.013 g), EtOH (0.5 mL), NHPI (0.1 mmol)],
(d) NHPI amount [catalyst (0.013 g), temperature (75 °C), EtOH
(0.5 mL)], (e) catalyst amount [NHPI (0.06 mmol), temperature (75
°C), EtOH (0.5 mL)], and (f) various oxidants in the oxidation
of 1-phenyl ethanol (1 mmol) catalyzed by the Mo–V complex
under O2 (1 atm) after 2 h.

The efficiency of oxidation was
affected remarkably by the amount of NHPI, indicating that a radical
process prevails to a great extent in the present system (Figure 8d). Also, a survey
of the results in Figure 8e indicated that the finest activity was observed with 0.013
g of the catalyst; hence, it was taken as the most appropriate quantity
of the Mo–VO complex under the conditions employed in this
work. On the basis of the data in Figure 8f, among the common oxidants examined, TBHP
and O2 were conceivable, giving relatively higher yields
for this transformation; nevertheless, O2 is superior because
of the economic factor and the eco-friendly advantage.

Having
obtained the optimized conditions, the aerobic oxidation of various
benzylic alcohols was examined (Table 1). Structurally and electronically diverse benzylic
alcohols were generally excellent substrates for this system, and
no overoxidation of alcohols occurred. Our results exhibited the oxidation
performance affected by the electronic properties of substrates. Electron-withdrawing
groups on the phenyl rings of alcohols accelerated the reaction (Table 1, entry 6), whereas
electron-donating ones retarded it (Table 1, entries 2–5). On the basis of the
results, the steric hindrance of alcohols was not dominant. Furthermore,
secondary benzylic alcohols gave moderate to excellent yields (Table 1, entries 7–10).
To demonstrate the chemoselectivity of the method, cinnamyl alcohol,
an alcohol containing a C=C double bond, and 4-(methylsulfanyl)benzyl
alcohol, carrying an oxidative sensitive sulfur atom, were subjected
to the oxidation procedure. The related carbonyl compounds were produced
in both cases, and the olefin moiety and sulfide group remained intact
(Table 1, entries 11
and 12). In addition, heterocyclic alcohol, such as furan-2-ylmethanol,
was a good substrate in this transformation and afforded the corresponding
aldehyde in 48% yield (Table 1, entry 13). It should be mentioned that attempts to oxidize
saturated aliphatic alcohols under different conditions failed.

System Catalyzed by the Mo(VI)–V(V) Nanobimetallic Complexa
a The reactions were run with substrate (1 mmol),
NHPI
(0.06 mmol), and catalyst (13 mg) under O2 (5–7
mL/min) at 75 °C in EtOH (0.5 mL).

b The products were identified by comparison with authentic
sample retention times of GC analysis and NMR spectra.

c The selectivities of products were >99%
based on GC analysis.

The promising results obtained in the oxidation of benzyl alcohols
impelled us to evaluate the potential of the title bimetallic nanocomplex
for the selective oxidation of benzylic hydrocarbons. The result obtained
from the oxidation of ethyl benzene under the optimized conditions
for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols was disappointing. Therefore,
to achieve new conditions for an efficient oxidation, several factors
were screened (see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). The best performance of the bimetallic nanocomplex
was obtained in the selective oxidation of ethylbenzene (1 mmol) using
NHPI (0.1 mmol) and acetic acid (0.3 mL) in the presence of 10 mg
of catalyst under aerobic conditions at 75 °C.

Next, the
scope of this catalytic system was tested with a number of benzylic
hydrocarbons under optimized conditions, and target compounds were
produced in good to excellent yields (Table 2). It was noteworthy that the afforded carbonyl
compounds were the sole products in all cases. The reaction also proceeded
smoothly with electron-accepting or -releasing substituents on benzylic
hydrocarbons (Table 2, entries 2 and 3). The chemoselectivity of the procedure was remarkable.
2-Phenyl ethanol oxidized selectively to 2-hydroxy-1-phenylethan-1-one,
whereas the hydroxyl group was tolerated in the reaction (Table 2, entry 7). Moreover,
adamantane gave only 2-adamantanone with 48% yield (Table 2, entry 8).

Nanocomplexa
a The reactions were
run with substrate (1 mmol),
NHPI (0.1 mmol), and catalyst (10 mg) under O2 (5–7
mL·min–1) at 75 °C in AcOH (0.3 mL).

b The products were identified
by comparison with authentic sample retention times of GC analysis
and NMR spectra.

c The selectivities
of products were >99% based on GC analysis.

We also investigated
the recyclability of the catalyst. To this goal, the catalyst was
subjected to aerobic oxidation of 1-phenylethanol and ethylbenzene
under the optimized conditions. After completion of the reaction,
the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation,
followed by decantation with ethanol (3 × 5 mL), drying at 60
°C for 2 h, and then using directly for further reactions. The
catalyst showed remarkable results without noticeable loss of activity
even after 10 runs as indicated in Figure 9. These observations illustrate a promising
approach from a sustainable and practical chemistry viewpoint.

Figure 9 Recycling of
the catalytic
system for the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol and ethylbenzene using
the Mo(VI)–V(V) bimetallic nanocomplex, according to procedures
mentioned in the Experimental Section.

The possibility of metal leaching during the oxidation reaction was
the final examination. The leaching of Mo and V from the catalyst
was excluded by AAS analysis of filtrates. The analysis of the product
mixtures after centrifugation of the hot solution showed no Mo or
V within the limit of detection (<1 ppm). The stability of the
catalyst was also documented by recording the FTIR spectra of the
used catalyst recovered from the reaction of both 1-phenylethanol
and ethylbenzene (Figure 10). Quite the same spectra were observed, demonstrating that
the catalyst preserved its integrity during the oxidation reaction.

the used one in aerobic oxidation of (b) 1-phenylethanol and (c) ethylbenzene.

Table 3 shows the
merit of this operational protocol in comparison with those previously
reported methods, in terms of catalyst loading, yield, and especially
conditions used in the aerobic oxidation of 1-phenylethanol and ethylbenzene
as model substrates. Therefore, the title methodology is environmentally
benign because of using oxygen as an ideal oxidant, reusing of an
active catalyst, and finally green reaction media.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we
have designed a new heterobimetallic organosilicon Schiff base nanocomplex
containing Mo and V, both of which are biologically significant transition
metals. The Mo(VI)–V(V) bimetallic nanocomplex was found to
be an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for aerobic oxidation of benzylic
alcohols and benzylic hydrocarbons in the presence of NHPI. The presented
catalytic oxidation systems showed remarkable selectivities. The intriguing
features of this catalytic system are the use of oxygen as a green
oxidant, safe reaction media, reusability, and recyclability of the
catalyst, which render the catalyst amenable to use in industrial
applications. The catalytic system inspired by the presented method
is expected to provide a new strategy toward more sustainable transformations,
which is currently ongoing in our laboratory.

Nanocomplex
To a solution of HL (1 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL),
a mixture of Mo(acac)2 (0.5 mmol) and VO(acac)2 (0.5 mmol) in ethanol (10 ml) was gradually added over a period
