A simplistic and low-cost method
that dramatically improves the
performance of solution-grown hematite photoanodes for solar-driven
water splitting through incorporation of nanohybrid metal oxide overlayers
was developed. By heating the α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 electrode in an inert atmosphere,
such as argon or nitrogen, the photocurrent increased to over 2 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, which is
10 times higher than that of pure hematite under 1 sun (100 mW/cm2, AM 1.5G) light illumination. For the first time, we found
a significant morphological difference between argon and nitrogen
gas heat-treated hematite films and discussed the consequences for
photoresponse. The origin for the enhancement, probed via theoretical
modeling, stems from the facile incorporation of low formation energy
dopants into the Fe2O3 layer at the interface
of the metal oxide nanohybrid overlayer, which decreases recombination
by increasing the electrical conductivity of Fe2O3. These dopants diffuse from the overlayer into the α-Fe2O3 layer readily under inert gas heat treatment.
This simple yet effective strategy could be applied to other dopants
to increase hematite performance for solar energy conversion applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Hematite (α-Fe2O3) thin films have
been actively investigated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting
because of their narrow band gap of approximately 1.9–2.2 eV,
their sufficiently deep valence band position for water oxidation,
and high relative existence of hematite in the earth’s crust.
It has been reported to possess a maximum theoretical photocurrent
of 12.6 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE) under 1 sun illumination and a theoretical solar-to-hydrogen
(STH) efficiency of 12.9–15.3%.1−3 However, hematite suffers
from poor charge transport capacity with a short hole diffusion length
of 2–4 nm, thus making recombination a severe limiting factor.4−6 To improve the STH conversion efficiency, charge separation and
surface reaction kinetics need to be enhanced. This can be achieved
in several ways, for example, through morphology variation,7 the addition of dopants,7−13 and cocatalysts on the surface.5,6 The latter
two techniques introduce passivating surface states which can decrease
surface recombination at low photovoltages. In terms of bulk dopants,
which act to increase the electrical conducting properties of the
photoanode, a number of metals/metal oxides have been combined with
hematite, such as Pt11 Ti12 or SiO2,2,8 SnO2,7 and TiO2.13 Generally the addition of such dopants requires high temperatures
(>600 °C) under oxidizing conditions, which can also cause
the
diffusion of SnO2 from the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)
layer of the substrate into the hematite film with a consequential
increase in donor density and conductivity.7,14,15 In cases where Sn is used as a dopant from
the FTO substrate in high temperature (>600 °C) treatment
methods,
there is limited control over dopant concentration in the hematite
layer, thus resulting in poor device performance. As such, there is
a need for a simpler, more cost-effective method of modifying hematite
photoanodes for enhanced activity, and more work is needed to understand
the role of dopants and overlayers. There are many reported synthetic
routes for hematite synthesis at low temperature (<700 °C),
such as magnetron sputtering,6 atmospheric
pressure chemical vapor deposition,16 and
atomic layer deposition (ALD).17 Electrodeposition
is a popular solution-based technique; however, there are comparably
fewer reports of hematite synthesis by electrodeposition, which is
surprising given its comparative low-cost and scalability. Herein,
we report an easy, affordable method to prepare robust α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 layered
photoanodes, which exhibit significantly higher photocurrents than
pure α-Fe2O3. Surprisingly, following
a low temperature (≤500 °C) heat treatment of the α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 photoanodes
in inert gas (argon or nitrogen), a near 10-fold increase in the photocurrent
compared to those heated in air was achieved. From scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images, there was an obvious morphological difference
in the hematite after argon treatment and nitrogen treatment. The
microstructure thermodynamics of the substitutional doping was elucidated
using density functional theory (DFT) studies to investigate the reason
for the enhanced activity. This revealed low formation energies at
the surface compared to the bulk under experimental conditions indicating
large dopant concentrations (SnFe and TiFe)
at the interfaces that increase the conductivity. These results shed
light on a new strategy to significantly enhance the activity of hematite
photoanodes for efficient solar energy conversion to fuels. This uncomplicated
inert gas heat treatment method can be applied to other hematite/dopant
anodes.

Results and Discussion
α-Fe2O3 (hematite) photoanodes were
prepared by heating electrodeposited FeOOH (iron oxyhydroxide) films
at 500 °C for 1 h. The SnO2–TiO2 metal oxide overlayer precursor solution was introduced by spin
coating directly onto the α-Fe2O3 films.
In SEM images (Figure 1a–c), the thickness of the α-Fe2O3 layer was ca. 300 nm, while the overlayer was ca. 100 nm. The host
material α-Fe2O3 average particle size
was ca. 25 nm in diameter. In the overlayer, very small SnO2 and TiO2 particles, ca. 5 nm in diameter, were also identified.
This is because the precursor solution, peroxotitanic acid, is a thixotropic
fluid which can also work as a medium, so that Sn precursors can mix
into the Ti precursors easily, a phenomenon we observed previously
during deposition of BiVO4/TiO2 films.18 In this study, it is considered that the dopant
particles are monodispersed and ultrafine, which is advantageous for
the doping process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used
to elucidate the exact nature of the chemical species present in the
α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 films, see Figure S1 (Supporting Information). From the Fe(III) 2p region, we observed Fe 2p3/2 at
710.8 eV, indicating the presence of Fe in the 3+ oxidation state.19,20 For the samples containing overlayers, the metal oxide species were
characterized for both Sn and Ti incorporation; with the Sn, the 3d5/2 peak was centered at 486.7 eV, matching the expected 4+
oxidation state,21 and the Ti 2p3/2 transition was centered at 458.8 eV, corresponding to Ti4+.19,20

and (g) Ar at 550 °C.

In general, there is no significant effect on the morphology,
crystallinity,
and optical absorption of hematite even if it is heated at temperature
≤500 °C in air.22 We first
probed the effect of inert gas treatment on the morphology of the
films. The SEM images (Figure 1d–g) reveal that before annealing in inert gas, the
original α-Fe2O3 film exhibited a very
porous morphology. After heat treatment in nitrogen, the particles
appear to enlarge and coalesce; as such the particle size increase
was proportional to the temperature. Following the heat treatment
in argon, the morphology changed significantly. The particles fused
together much more, resulting in a mesoporous-like structure. This
was similar to the shape after 800 °C in air, which is reported
in refs2,7 From our XPS analysis at several positions of the bare α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, only following the heat treatment
in argon did the Sn 3d peak of FTO glass disappear (Figure 2S), which suggests that the heat treatment in argon
leads to significantly better coverage of the mesoporous hematite
film. Furthermore, it was noted that no nitrogen species were detected
by XPS analysis, indicating no chemical reaction with nitrogen. Focused
ion beam-SEM (FIB-SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
cross-section analysis was conducted to explore the elemental distribution
in the α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 films before and after inert gas treatment. Figure 2 (also see Figure 3S) displays the SEM images of the cross-section with
EDS elemental distribution for the Fe, Ti, Sn, and O elements. With
regard to the Fe2O3 particles, these agreed
with that shown in Figure 1. Surprisingly, the nanohybrid metal oxide overlayer became
thinner and almost disappeared after the treatment. In particular,
it was clearly detected that the distribution peak of Ti spread uniformly
in the treated porous hematite layer. In other words, it seems that
the overlayer became an ultrafine protective shell on the surface
of each hematite particle. Figure 3S indicates
in detail the diminution of the Ti peak in the EDS spectra of the
samples after the inert gas treatment. Metal oxides (SnO2 and TiO2) of the overlayer will not disappear by heating
at a low temperature of 500 °C under inert gas. For this reason,
Ti density was lowered to the detection limit level of the EDS after
the inert gas treatment. It can be inferred that an extremely small
amount of dopant is required for highly photoactive Fe2O3 anode.

500 nm.

The lattice parameters of bare
α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/TiO2, and α-Fe2O3/SnO2 films were calculated from X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 4S–6S and Table 1S). We found that the lattice
volume decreased after inert gas treatment. For example, in the case
of bare Fe2O3, the lattice volume was 303.11
Å in air, and after Ar and N2 treatment, it became
302.70 and 302.71 Å, respectively. Likewise, the lattice volume
of Fe2O3/SnO2 changed from 302.78
Å (air) to 302.41 Å (Ar) and 302.59 Å (N2); the lattice volume of Fe2O3/TiO2 changed from 302.75 Å (air) to 302.44 Å (Ar) and 302.60
Å (N2). Previous reports have described that the unit
cell length of pure α-Fe2O3 enlarges as
a function of the annealing temperature in air.23 After inert gas treatment, the volume decreased due to
site distortion of the bare α-Fe2O3. In
general, the smaller the crystal size, the lower is the average site
distortion.23 Consequently, when Ti or
Sn was doped into the Fe2O3 unit cell, it is
thought that crystal lattice distortion was mitigated by the dopants.
According to previous reports, when the crystal distortion change
after doping is small, the appearance of the material does not change
but the conductivity improves.7,9 In Figure 7S, there is no big change in the XRD pattern of Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 before
and after inert gas treatment. Peaks are located at the same points
as in references JCPDS file of α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 33-0664), SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445), and TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272). As the thickness of the hematite layer
was ca. 300 nm, the metal oxide overlayer thickness was <100 nm,
and because of the low treatment temperature of 500 °C, the peaks
of Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 films appeared relatively weak. After inert gas treatment, the peaks
of Fe2O3 appeared clearly stronger than before
treatment because of the improvement of crystallinity. UV–vis
spectroscopy shows that the absorption of these α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 photoanodes
did not alter significantly after inert gas heat treatment (Figure 8S), indicating good stability and, in
addition, no Fe2TiO5 or other mixed iron/metal
oxide phases were found from our XRD and XPS studies, indicating that
these were pure α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 films. Our results above demonstrated that
under inert gas treatment at 500 °C, hematite undergoes a change
in morphology. Plausibly, this allows for the overlayer dopants to
diffuse into the Fe2O3 layer more readily.

PEC performance of the α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 electrodes was investigated first
by measuring the photocurrent density–potential (J–V) curves, as shown in Figure 3a. The α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 films were measured
in 1 M NaOH (pH 13.6) electrolyte under 1 sun with an AM 1.5G filter.
Without inert gas heat treatment (black line), the photocurrent was
low (<0.6 mA/cm2 at 1.7 V vs RHE). Astonishingly, after
heating in nitrogen or argon gas at 500 °C, they exhibited a
significant increase in activity to around 5.0 mA/cm2 at
1.7 V versus RHE. The activity was recorded from the α-Fe2O3 containing both SnO2 and TiO2, with a photocurrent of ca. 2.0 mA/cm2 at 1.23
V versus RHE. Furthermore, the onset potential exhibited a dramatic
cathodic shift by as much as 0.7 V versus RHE. Generally speaking,
onset potential can be improved by surface treatment. On the other
hand, photocurrent plateau can be improved by increase in charge carrier
concentration via doping.5,16,24 To compare the effect of heat treatment in argon versus nitrogen, J–V curves were collected from α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 films
(Figure 3a). Interestingly,
after N2 treatment the photocurrent onset shifted cathodically
to a greater extent than after Ar treatment. In the low potential
range, the N2-treated samples showed higher photocurrent
density (1.04 mA/cm2 at 1.0 V vs RHE) than the Ar-treated
samples (0.64 mA/cm2 at 1.0 V vs RHE). On the other hand,
in the high potential range, the Ar-treated samples showed higher
photocurrent density than the N2-treated samples (JAr = 3.32 mA/cm2 at 1.5 V vs RHE, JN2 = 2.71 mA/cm2 at 1.5 V vs RHE). Similar relationship between Ar and
N2 treatment was obtained from the J–V curves of the α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 samples processed after annealing
at 450 °C (Figure 9S). It is generally
accepted that the conductivity of hematite and the amount of band
bending both affect the photocurrent at higher potentials, whereas
the onset potential shift is controlled by surface state passivation.5,16,24 However, in previous literatures,
the onset potential was in the range of 0.8–1.0 V versus RHE.
In this study, the onset potential of α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 (inert gas) films
showed more negative values at 0.65 V versus RHE (Figure 10Sa,b). Even though the onset potential of N2-treated Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 and Ar-treated Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 are the same at 0.65 V versus RHE, the photocurrent
density has noticeable difference in the low potential range. Likely
if onset potential is in a high level, it will be difficult to shift
any further. The surface state effect may only display on photocurrent
in the low potential range. The difference in the effect of Ar and
N2 treatment on the photocurrent is dominated by the morphological
change from heating hematite in a low oxygen atmosphere. This suggests
that nitrogen treatment has a greater effect on the surface of hematite,
whereas argon heat treatment permits SnO2–TiO2 migration into the bulk. Both gases have a different level
of oxygen impurity—this gives a different partial pressure
of oxygen and this has the greatest effect on the results. From the
SEM/EDS, XRD, and PEC results, it is likely that the SnO2–TiO2 overlayer can diffuse deeper into the hematite
host after argon heat treatment compared to nitrogen, leading to higher
photocurrent plateau. In addition, PEC performances of individual
SnO2 and TiO2 overlayers on α-Fe2O3 were measured (Figure 3c,d). The photocurrent density after heating at 500
°C in argon increased; for example, in the case of α-Fe2O3/SnO2 film, the photocurrent density
went up from 0.08 to 1.20 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V versus RHE.
However, the maximum photocurrent was not as high compared to the
composite SnO2–TiO2 on α-Fe2O3 photoanode. Furthermore, little change in PEC
performance was exhibited by the pure α-Fe2O3 film after inert gas treatment (Figure 3b). This indicates that the excellent photoactivity
is a result of the presence of the SnO2–TiO2 overlayer. From the results above, the migration of the nanosized
metal oxide species from the overlayer into the α-Fe2O3 layer appears to occur more readily after inert gas
treatment than after heat treatment in air, and therefore leads to
a certain amount of doping at the interface of the hematite surface.

To experimentally ascertain the
effect of Sn/Ti doping on the electronic
properties of hematite, donor densities (NA) and flat-band potentials (Vfb) of the
α-Fe2O3/MO anodes were estimated from
the Mott–Schottky plot (Figures 4a and 11Sa–c). From
the Mott–Schottky plot of before and after inert gas treatment,
the slope of the linear part of the curves understandably presented
a difference. The summary of the Mott–Schottky plot analysis
is shown in Tables 1 and 2. The flat-band potentials are consistent
and matched to onset potentials of bare α-Fe2O3 (air) and α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 (inert gas) films showing at ca. 0.55 V versus
RHE and ca. 0.65 V versus RHE, respectively (Figures 3a,b and 10Sa–c). At a low temperature of <500 °C, heat treatment for hematite
has been discussed previously22 in which
there is no significant change in the flat-band potential. In Table 1, the flat-band position
and donor density almost did not change after heat treatment of the
bare Fe2O3 films (Vfb = ∼0.6 V vs RHE and NA = ∼1018 cm–3), so there was no resultant change
in photoresponse. In contrast, it is clear that the flat-band potential
of Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 (air) shifted to more positive values, possibly due to the influence
of the metal oxide overlayer. It was considered that because the dopants
were not incorporated into hematite sufficiently, there was no change
in the donor density. However, after inert gas heat treatment, the
donor densities of the films were of the order of 1018 cm–3 for Fe2O3 and up to 1020 cm–3 for α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2. A higher donor density can
lead to an increase in electrical conductivity.20 The interfacial properties between the hematite photoelectrode
and the electrolyte were also analyzed by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The inset figure of Figure 4b shows the electronic equivalent
circuit model representing the hematite photoanode/electrolyte system
used in the EIS data modeling. RS represents
the circuit series resistance, whereas Rbulk and Rct represent the resistance of
the bulk charge-trapping resistance and charge-transfer resistance
across the hematite–electrolyte interface, respectively. Cbulk represents the bulk capacitance of space-charge
layer and the Helmholtz layer. Css represents
the capacitance corresponding to surface states. The Nyquist plots
(imaginary-real components of impedance plots, −Z″ vs Z′) were collected at 1.23 V
versus RHE under 1 sun light; it is obvious from Figure 4b that the maximum imaginary
impedance (−Z″) of inert gas-treated
Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 films are less than 0.5 × 103 Ω. The maximum
imaginary impedance of the Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 (air) electrode without inert gas treatment
showed a higher number of ca. 1 × 103 Ω. Simultaneously,
the bare Fe2O3 (air) electrode exhibited a much
larger maximum imaginary impedance of ca. 10 × 103 Ω. Inert gas treatment is thought to be able to promote the
conductivity of the hematite anode by charge separation and charge
transport properties. As a result, the recombination rate of electron–hole
pairs was decreased and the photocurrent density was improved. Many
literatures have been investigated for Sn and Ti doped into hematite.
It is interpreted that the transportation of electrons is improved
by creating a heterojunction of the suitable position of the conduction
bands.20,27,28 Therefore,
an increase in electrical conductivity can lead to longer lifetime
of photogenerated charge carriers from the consequence of reduced
recombination. On the other hand, according to the Dunn et al. report,25 doping Sn into hematite can accelerate the hole
transfer rate in hematite. From our results of PEC measurements, both
separation of charge carriers in hematite and transfer of holes across
the anode as well as the electrolyte interface have been promoted
by doping Sn and Ti into hematite under inert gas at <500 °C.

We carried out photoluminescence (PL) measurements
(Figure 12S) on the α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 samples. We
observed
strong emissions from the sample before inert gas treatment, which
was the PL response exhibited at about 570 nm, which can be assigned
to band edge emission. Obviously, the samples after Ar and N2 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the emission intensity,
which is a strong indication of the efficiency of charge separation.
This is in good agreement with our PEC observation. High donor density
and low PL intensity suggested the SnO2–TiO2 overlayer after inert gas treatment can improve electron
transfer through an increase in charge conductivity, and therefore
can reduce electron–hole recombination. Indeed, dopants such
as Sn and Ti have been reported to improve photoactivity by increasing
the donor density, carrier conductivity, and charge separation, along
with decreasing the density of trap states and electron–hole
recombination.13,20,26−29 The nanohybrid metal oxide SnO2–TiO2, in effect, creates suitable junctions with hematite for photogenerated
electron transfer from the metal oxides into hematite and through
to the counter electrode. Consequently, by applying a low bias, the
holes diffuse to the surface to promote water oxidation.28 To confirm that the photocurrent was indeed
a direct product of water splitting as opposed to side reactions,
the photogenerated amounts of hydrogen and oxygen were measured by
gas chromatography, while applying a constant potential of 1.5 V versus
RHE. Evolution of hydrogen and oxygen from a α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 hybrid anode
were collected at regular intervals. After 90 min reaction, 100 μmol
of hydrogen and 51 μmol of oxygen were measured from the headspace,
equivalent to an approximate 2:1 molar ratio (Figure 5). This indicates that the photocurrent is
a direct result of water splitting. Furthermore, the faradic efficiency
was over 90%. This result indicated that with the applied bias at
1.5 V versus RHE, the photogenerated holes can move from the valence
band of hematite to the electrolyte, passing through the remaining
ultrathin overlayer for water oxidation. The stability test revealed
an excellent record for α-Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 (Figure 6); the slight decrease in photocurrent is
due to the accumulation of oxygen gas bubbles on the surface.

With the intent to investigate
the effect of air/inert gas heat
treatment and metal oxide incorporation on the electronic properties
of hematite, DFT modeling of Fe2O3 was undertaken
in parallel with the experimental work. To elucidate the effects of
doping in the bulk and on the {0001} surface, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBEsol) + U(30−32) approach was utilized to calculate
large supercells and slabs to simulate the dilute limit. PBEsol + U is known to accurately describe the structural and electronic
properties of Fe2O3 compared to an experiment.33−37 The substitutional dopants considered in this study were Ti and
Sn to mimic the effects of unintentional incorporation of dopants
from the TiO2 and SnO2 overlayers, respectively.

The conventional unit cell of α-Fe2O3 is shown in Figure 13S, displaying the
crystal structure of the three-dimensional array of the FeO6 distorted octahedra. The structural parameters and bond lengths
are shown in Table 2S and show excellent
agreement with experimentally measured values and with previous theoretical
works using DFT + U.33−37

The density of states (DOS) and band structure
for bulk α-Fe2O3 are shown in Figures 14Sa,b, respectively. In the DOS, the
valence-band maximum (VBM) is primarily
made up of ∼70% O 2p states mixing with ∼30%
Fe 3d states, whereas the conduction-band minimum (CBM) is predominantly
Fe 3d states (∼90%) with some mixing with
O 2p states (∼10%). The band structure in Figure 14Sb shows that α-Fe2O3 has an indirect band gap of ∼2.19 eV with a
VBM situated between Γ and L and the CBM at F, which is consistent with previous theory and experiment.33−35,38−43 The direct band gap from the VBM to the conduction band has a magnitude
of ∼2.29 eV. Both the VBM and CBM are made up of flat bands
with high effective masses. The reasoning behind this is the lack
of mixing between Fe and O at either the VBM or CBM. This is in contrast
to the energy range >5 eV, which shows increased dispersion due
to
an enhanced mixing between the Fe s states and O p states. The dopant states were calculated using oxygen
partial pressures to simulate the experimental conditions of 773 K,
1 atm. Substitutional Sn and Ti dopant defects (SnFe and
TiFe) possess formation enthalpies of 3.32 and 2.73 eV,
respectively, suggesting easy incorporation of Sn and Ti into the
Fe2O3 lattice under thermodynamic equilibrium.
This is corroborated with previous theoretical studies showing similar
low formation energies.33,44 The DOS for the bulk
supercells are shown in Figure 7a–c for the pure, Ti-, and Sn-doped supercells. For
TiFe (Figure 7b), the Ti d states appear at the CBM and continue
to be prevalent in the conduction band up to ∼4 eV. This behavior
is seen in other theoretical works using DFT + U.45 The Fermi level in Ti-doped Fe2O3 appears at ∼1.94 eV compared to the band gap in the
host supercell of ∼2.1 eV. The DOS for the Sn-doped supercell
shows a considerable percentage of Sn d and s states in the valence band from ∼2 to ∼1
eV; there is also substantial Sn s and p states from the CBM toward 4 eV. The Fermi level occurs at ∼1.5
eV above the VBM indicating a large reduction of the band gap from
the host supercell. The formation energies for the {0001} surface
are calculated at 773 K, 1 atm and are shown in Table 3S. SnFe is found to be most stable in site
3 (Figure 15S) on the {0001} surface and
is more stable than the next most preferable site (site 1) by ∼0.26
eV (ΔHf = 0.72 eV). TiFe, on the other hand, is shown to be most stable in site 1, which
is the three-coordinate position and is more stable than site 2 by
∼0.14 eV (ΔHf = 0.14 eV).
From our calculations, surface doping is therefore highly favorable
in Fe2O3, predicting a large concentration of
dopant species at the interface. The DOS for the pure {0001} surface,
Ti-doped surface (in site 1), and the Sn-doped surface (in site 3)
are shown in Figure 7d–f. For both doped surfaces, there exist gap states ∼0.6
eV above the VBM comprising predominantly Fe d hybridization
with O p. In each case, the Fermi level on the surface
is trapped in these states at ∼0.6 and ∼0.76 eV above
the VBM for TiFe and SnFe, respectively. In
TiFe, most of the Ti d states occur in
the conduction band from ∼2 to 4 eV above the VBM. In the Sn-doped
{0001} surface, there is considerable mixing of Sn s and d states in the valence band up to the VBM
owing to the possibility of Sn2+ lone pairs, while substantial
Sn s, p, and d states are seen in
the conduction band. Our results indicate that the dopant states (not
water-splitting reaction mechanism) will be most prominent at the
α-Fe2O3/SnO2(TiO2) interfaces and should explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity
seen. Both Ti and Sn dopants are low formation energy donors and have
been known to increase the conductivities of Fe2O3 films, which has the effect of enhancing the electron transfer from
the conduction band of Fe2O3 to the SnO2 (TiO2) layers.46

Sn-doped supercells respectively. (d–f) show the DOS for the
{0001} surfaces of the host, Ti (site 1), and Sn (site 3) surfaces,
respectively. In each example, the VBM is set to 0 eV and the position
of the Fermi level is depicted by the orange line. Both spin-up and
spin-down states are shown, and the dopant states have been scaled
accordingly for clarity. In (e,f), the zoomed-in gap states are inset.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed
a series of highly active, stable α-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting, whose
activity was remarkably enhanced through addition of a metal oxide
overlayer and low heat (≤500 °C) treatment under an inert
gas. This method of overlayer formation is much simpler and lower
in cost than other thin film deposition techniques, such as ALD, and
therefore is easier to scale-up. Using this method, the average unit
cell volume decreased (calculated from lattice parameters of Fe2O3/TiO2 and Fe2O3/SnO2), and the morphology changed significantly after
heating in argon gas. We have shown that the SnO2–TiO2 layer after inert gas treatment induces a substantial effect
on the PEC activity of hematite, both in terms of maximum photocurrent
and onset potential. We found that the metal oxide dopants can migrate
easily from the overlayer through to the α-Fe2O3 layer at modest temperatures under reduced oxygen conditions,
which ultimately led to a 10-fold rise in photocurrent. From our electrochemical
measurements, it was found that the donor densities of the films increased
when Sn and Ti dopants are incorporated. Theoretical modeling revealed
that the dopant defects, TiFe and SnFe, were
found to possess low formation energies under the experimental synthesis
conditions. More likely, under inert gas treatment, even at low temperatures
(≤500 °C), intrinsic electronic structure of hematite
can be improved by TiFe and SnFe. This will,
in turn, lead to improved donor density and electronic conductivity
and retard recombination, therefore, higher stable photocurrents can
be obtained. We believe this facile, cost-effective strategy can be
applied to other hematite/dopant photoelectrodes to strengthen their
activity for solar fuel production.

Experimental Section
Film Preparation
Nanoparticle α-Fe2O3 films (area of
about 1.0 cm × 1.5 cm) were fabricated
by galvanostatic deposition at 60 °C. The bath was an aqueous
solution containing 0.2 M iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O, Acros Organics). Conducting FTO glass
(TEC15, NSG) was used as the substrate. Before deposition, the FTO
glass substrates were sonicated in acetone and distilled water for
30 min each, dried in air, and then placed in a furnace at 400 °C
for 30 min. The anodic deposition was carried out in galvanostatic
mode. A 5 cm2 Pt gauze was used as the counter electrode.
Iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) films were deposited at a constant current
density of +0.3 mA/cm2, corresponding to an electric charge
of 0.27 C/cm2. After each deposition, the resulting film
was rinsed with deionized water and dried in air. To obtain crystalline
α-Fe2O3 electrodes, as-deposited films
were annealed in air at 500 °C for 1 h at a rate of 5 °C/min.
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) and tin oxide (SnO2)
were introduced as overlayers on the α-Fe2O3 films. The precursor of TiO2 was 0.01 wt % peroxotitanic
acid, prepared by dissolving amorphous TiO2 into hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2, Sigma-Aldrich, 30 wt % in H2O) in an ice-bath. The SnO2 precursor solution
was obtained from a filtered solution of 0.05 g tin powder (Sn, 150
μm, Goodfellow Ltd, England) in 20 ml H2O2, after stirring for 24 h. The precursor mixture was made by adding
the SnO2 precursor solution to the peroxotitanic acid of
1:1 vol %. The solution was sonicated for 10 min before spin-coating
onto the α-Fe2O3 film at 1000 rpm for
10 s. This coating process was repeated five times to obtain the overlayer
thickness of 100 nm, followed by heat treatment at 500 °C in
air for 1 h. A final annealing process was carried out at 450, 500,
and 550 °C, ramp rate 5 °C/min for 1 h in nitrogen (BOC,
99.998%) or argon gas (BOC, 99.998%), flow rate 200 mL/min.

Film Characterization
The morphologies of the films
were characterized using a JEOL JSM-6700F field emission SEM. The
EDS analysis result was obtained by a FIB-SEM (Zeiss Crossbeam 540)
equipped with an EDS unit (Oxford Instruments, silicon drift detector—X-MaxN). The acceleration voltage was 15 kV. XPS data were collected
on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer under
ultrahigh vacuum (<5 × 108 Torr) using a monochromatic
Al Kα X-ray source, at an operating ion gun energy of 200 eV,
scanning 10 times for each element. The adventitious carbon 1s peak
was calibrated to 284.5 eV and used as an internal standard to compensate
for any charging effects. Phase identification of the films was achieved
using a Bruker D8 DISCOVER LynxEye thin-film X-ray diffractometer
equipped with Cu Kα1 (using 40 kV and 40 mA, λ = 1.540619
Å) radiation, operated in 2θ scan mode from 15° to
66°, X-ray incident angle at 1°, 0.05° step size, 6
s per step. To confirm α-Fe2O3, SnO2, and TiO2, reference JCPDS files for α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 33-0664), SnO2 (JCPDS
no. 41-1445), and TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272) are cited. The
PL spectra were obtained by using Horiba Scientific LabRAM HR Evolution
as the excitation source operated at a wavelength of 325 nm.

PEC Measurements
Photoresponse of the α-Fe2O3 films
was measured using a 150 W xenon solar
simulator lamp (Newport, 96000) fitted with an AM 1.5G filter, a monochromator
with a 395 nm long pass filter, and a home built programmable light
chopper (Oriental Motor). The light output was calibrated to 1 sun
(100 mW/cm2). PEC performance of the films was evaluated
in a three-electrode configuration using a potentiostat/galvanostat
analyzer (Ivium Technologies GmBH). The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl
in 3 M KCl (BaSi Inc., UK), and a 5 cm2 Pt gauze was used
as the counter electrode. Films were illuminated from the FTO glass
substrate side. The scan rate for cyclic voltammetry was 10 mV/s.
The electrolyte comprised a 1 M NaOH solution (pH 13.6). All potentials
in this work are reported against the RHE, obtained from those relative
to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode using the Nernst equation, ERHE = EAg/AgCl0 + EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH, where ERHE is
the converted potential versus RHE, EAg/AgCl0 = 0.1976
at 25 °C, and EAg/AgCl is the experimentally
measured potential against the Ag/AgCl reference. Mott–Schottky
plots (capacitance–potential curves) were recorded of the impedance
in the dark at a frequency of 10 k Hz with ac amplitude of 10 mV. Equation 1 was used to determine
the flat-band potential (Vfb) and carrier
density (NA). 1  where NA is the
carrier density, ε0 is the permittivity in vacuum,
εr is the relative permittivity (α-Fe2O3 was taken as 32),47V is the applied potential, T is the absolute
temperature, e is the electronic charge, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. EIS data were recorded
using a Zennium E Electrochemical Workstation (Zahner) under solar
simulator light (1 sun, AM 1.5G) with a 100 kHz to 100 mHz frequency
range at 0.23 V versus Ag/AgCl in the electrolyte of 1 M NaOH solution
(pH 13.6) and with an alternate current perturbation of 10 mV.

GC Measurements
PEC water splitting on the Fe2O3/SnO2–TiO2 film was carried
out at an applied potential of 1.5 V versus RHE under AM 1.5G 100
mW/cm2 irradiation. An airtight three-electrode configuration
electrochemical cell was used, and 1 M NaOH (pH 13.6) was used as
an electrolyte. The evolved gases during the reaction were collected
by a gas-tight syringe from the headspace of the cell at regular intervals.
The evolved hydrogen and oxygen amounts were recorded by gas chromatography
(Varian 430-GC, 5A mol. sieve column, TCD detector, oven at 50 °C,
Ar gas as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 mL/min).

Computational
Methodology
To simulate the bulk and
surface properties of α-Fe2O3, the periodic
DFT code VASP48−51 together with the PBEsol52−54 functional was used. The PBEsol
functional is a gradient corrected functional revised for solids and
gives a reasonable representation of the structural and electronic
parameters of inorganic semiconductor materials, despite the well-documented
underestimation of the band gap.52,55,56 An on-site Coulomb “U”
correction57 was applied (Ueff = 4 eV) to describe the Fe d states, consistent with
previous theoretical studies.33,34,38,58,59 The projector augmented wave method60 was used to describe the interactions between the core and valence
electrons for each species involved in the calculations (Fe[Ar], O[He],
Ti[Ar], and Sn[Kr]).

The calculations were split into the bulk
structural and electronic properties, bulk dopant states, and surface
dopant states. For the bulk properties, a geometry optimization was
carried out on the unit cell of α-Fe2O3 containing 10 atoms which crystallizes in the rhombohedral R3̅c space group (corundum). For
all optimizations (unit cell, supercells, and surface slabs), a plane-wave
energy cutoff of 700 eV was used for accurate total energy convergence,
which was deemed to be complete when the force on all atoms was less
than 0.01 eV Å–1. The unit cell was sampled
using a Γ-centered k-point grid of 8 ×
8 × 8. From our calculations, the lowest energy magnetic ordering
was determined to be antiferromagnetic as seen in neutron diffraction
studies and previous DFT work.35,38,61−63

To elucidate the effects of doping in the bulk,
large 3 ×
3 × 3 supercells containing 270 atoms were created to simulate
the dilute limit. Structural optimizations were carried out relaxing
all but the cell volume and angles using a Γ-centered k-point grid of 2 × 2 × 2. The substitutional
dopants considered in this study were Ti and Sn to mimic the effects
of unintentional incorporation of dopants from the TiO2 and SnO2 interfaces, respectively. The enthalpy of formation
of the defects was treated using the equation 2  ED and EH refer to the total energies of the defective
supercell in the neutral charge state and the host supercells, respectively. Ei and μi are the elemental reference energies in their standard states
(where i = Fe(s), O2(g), Ti(s) and Sn(s)) and their respective chemical potentials,
respectively. n refers to the number of atoms of i taken away from (+n) or added to (−n) the system.

To gain an insight into surface segregation,
the formation energies
for Ti and Sn doping were calculated on the most stable Fe-terminated
{0001} surface of α-Fe2O3.58,59,64,65 To cleave the surface, the Metadise code66 was used to yield a 260-atom surface with a ∼27 Å thick
slab with ∼27 Å of vacuum. On the {0001} surface, three
different Fe sites are seen (depicted in Figure 15Sa,b). Site 1 has a three-coordinate trigonal pyramid coordination,
with sites 2 and 3 possessing distorted octahedral coordination. Γ-centered k-point grids of 3 × 3 × 1 were used to ensure
adequate convergence of the total energy when optimizing the surfaces.
Doping was carried out on both sides of the slab to ensure that no
dipole moment perpendicular to the surface was created.

The
chemical potential of μO can be calculated
using the oxygen partial pressure and temperature using the equation67  where H, T, and S are enthalpy, temperature, and entropy,
respectively. p0 = 1 atm with reference
to a zero state; .68−70 In the experimental synthesis,
annealing of the layered films occurred at 500 °C (∼773
K) and 1 atm, thus μO (773 K, 1 atm) = −0.82
eV, determined using data from thermochemical tables.71 μFe (773 K, 1 atm) can, therefore, be
determined within the formation enthalpy of Fe2O3 giving μFe (773 K, 1 atm) = −3.43 eV. μTi and μSn are limited via the formation of
the secondary phases, TiO2 and SnO2, respectively.
SnO2 and TiO2 were relaxed using plane-wave
cutoffs of 700 eV and Γ-centered k-point meshes
of 8 × 8 × 8 (FeO) and 8 × 8 × 6 (SnO2 and TiO2) with the same force convergence criterion mentioned
above. The enthalpies of formation for each phase was determined to
be −3.32 eV (FeO), −5.36 eV (SnO2), and −9.06
eV (TiO2), which agree well with the experiment.71 μTi (773 K, 1 atm) and μSn (773 K, 1 atm) are thus calculated to be −7.66 eV
and −3.66 eV, respectively.
