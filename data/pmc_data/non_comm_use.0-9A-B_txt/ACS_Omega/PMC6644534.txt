1 Introduction
The
design and preparation of any catalyst with superior catalytic
activity has become an important area of research. Nanoparticles as
catalysts offer receive much interest due to their higher surface/volume
ratio. The major drawback of using bare nanoparticles is agglomerization.
Therefore, it needs some stabilizer. At the same time, discovery of
graphene oxide has attracted much attention of chemists. Graphene
oxide offers interesting electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties1 and has a large surface area with various functional
groups, which provides for chemical modifications and makes graphene
oxide an important candidate in research.1b,2 Moreover,
it also acts as a good catalyst support. Therefore, scientists doped
NPs on the GO. Which internally stabilized the
NPs with no need for extra stabilizing agent. Metal/graphene oxide
nanocomposites play a vital role in several areas of research, such
as catalysis,1b sensors,3 and photocatalysis,4 for the
reduction process in organic synthesis,1b toxic metal ion removal,5 cellular imaging,6a,6b drug delivery,6c and many other properties
reported in the literature.6d−6l Copper is a cheap metal and shows a broad spectrum of catalytic
activity starting from C–C coupling7 to heterocycle synthesis.8 From the brief
discussion above, we were inspired to prepare a copper oxide/reduced
graphene oxide nanocomposite (CuO/rGO) for catalysis.

Flavanones
are basically oxygen-containing heterocycles,9 having a wide range of biological and pharmaceutical
properties. They exhibit antiviral,10 anticancer,11 antioxidant,12 anti-inflammatory,13 anti-HIV,14 and antiallergic
activities.15 The flavanone skeleton, also
present in many natural products, belongs to the flavonoid group.16 Some of the important flavanones which show
biological activities are shown in Figure 1. Therefore, flavanone is a very attractive
target for chemists and biologists. On the other hand, a triazole
molecule shows huge biological and pharmaceutical activities. In the
literature, it is reported that heterocycles containing a triazole
moiety show better biological activity than its mother heterocycles.17 Along this line, we plan to synthesize flavanones
attached to triazole. Various methodologies have been reported for
the synthesis of flavanones using a range of catalysts such as Hg(OCOCF3)2,18 iodine,19l-proline,20 ionic liquid EAN,21 NSSDAIL,22 silica ferric hydrogensulfate (SFHS),23l-alanine in the presence of base,24 PMA-SiO2,25N-methylimidazole,26 etc. Although each procedure has their own advantages, they also
have certain deficiencies, such as the use of toxic organic solvents,
harsh conditions, expensive and nonreusable catalysts, etc. However,
no method has been reported for the synthesis of flavanone-containing
triazole in one step. We herein report a CuO/rGO nanocomposite that
is an efficient, green, and sustainable catalyst for flavanone synthesis,
and it is also efficient for the construction of flavanones with triazole
in one pot.

2 Results and Discussion
Our investigation
progressed with the synthesis of CuO/rGO nanocomposites
as was reported by Zhang.28a Graphite oxide
was synthesized according to the modified Hummers method from graphite
powder.28b,28c In the second step, a mixture of GO (30
mg), CuCl2 (18 mg), and deionized water (200 mL) was taken
in a 500 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was then ultrasonicated
(50 Hz) for 1 h at room temperature. Then NaBH4 (10 mL,
1%) was added dropwise, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 100
°C for 24 h. After that, the reaction mixture was cooled at room
temperature, and the CuO/rGO nanocomposites were collected by centrifugation.
The resulting CuO/rGO nanocomposites were then dried at 100 °C
(Scheme 1) and characterized
by various analytical techniques.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation for the Synthesis
of CuO/rGO Nanocomposites
To determine the various functional groups, Fourier transform
infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of the synthesized CuO/rGO were obtained. The comparative
FT-IR spectrum of GO and CuO/rGO nanocomposites is shown in Figure 2. In this spectra,
GO shows absorption peaks at 3383, 1732, and 1107 cm–1 due to the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxy functionalities.29 In the FT-IR spectrum of CuO/rGO nanocomposites,
the intensity of −OH stretching was reduced significantly,
indicating reduction of GO during the doping process.6d,6e,6l The absorption peak at 513 cm–1 in CuO/rGO is due to the Cu–O stretching vibrations,
and the present results are in close agreement with those reported
values.1b,30 The number of peaks becomes weak or decreases
in CuO/rGO due to chemical reduction.1b,30

Figure 2 Comparative
FT-IR spectra of GO and CuO/rGO nanocomposites.

The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of GO (Figure 3A) shows the characteristic
diffraction peaks at 2θ ∼ 9.33 and 42.20 due to [001]
and [100] planes, indicating the oxidation of graphite to GO.29 In the PXRD pattern of the CuO/rGO nanocomposite
(Figure 3B), the disappearance
of the [100] plane at 2θ ∼ 42.20 and concomitant appearance
of a peak at 2θ ∼ 24.90 indicated the reduction of GO
to rGO during the doping of CuO NPs onto GO. The other diffraction
peaks at 2θ ∼ 36.45, 42.40, 43.28, 61.48, and 73.57 arise
due to Cu2O, CuO, and Cu particles. These values are very
close to the reported ones.31a

Figure 3 PXRD pattern
of (A) GO and (B) CuO/rGO nanocomposites.

The size and shape of the CuO/rGO were analyzed from transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure 4). Figure 4A represents the low-magnification image of CuO/rGO
nanocomposites, which indicates the incorporation of CuO NPs on the
surface of rGO. At 5 nm magnification (Figure 4B), it is found that the CuO NPs are 5–15
nm in size. Further, in the high-resolution (HR) TEM image (Figure 4C), the lattice fringes
exhibit an interplanar lattice spacing of 0.23 nm, which corresponds
to the (111) atomic planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice
of CuO.31b,31c The spherical shape of the CuO NPs is clearly
visible in the high-magnification TEM image (Figure 4C). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
analysis was also performed for the present catalytic system. In the
SEM image (Figure 4D), we observed that the spherical CuO NPs are embedded on the layers
of rGO. We also carried out SEM at lower magnification, which is shown
in Supporting Information Figure S1A. The
chemical composition and oxidation states of the prepared catalyst
were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. The EDX spectrum shows
the presence of Cu, O, and C species (Figure 4E). Further, the EDX spectrum carried out
at lower magnification is given in Supporting Information Figure S1B,C, indicating the presence of Cu, O,
and C species along with other impurities. The low loading of Cu was
confirmed by ICP-AES analysis (12.889%). The above discussion indicates
the successful preparation of CuO/rGO nanocomposites.

nanocomposites at 200 nm (A), 5 nm (B), and
2 nm (C). SEM image (D) and EDX spectrum (E) of CuO/rGO nanocomposites.

Initially, we investigated the
XPS analysis of GO. The presence
of oxygen in the XPS survey spectrum of GO confirms the oxidation
of graphite to GO (Figure 5A). The C 1s spectrum of GO shows four prominent peaks at
284.6, 286.6, 287.8, and 288.6 eV, corresponding to sp2-hybridized carbon and carbon containing various functionalities
such as hydroxyl (C–OH), epoxide (C–O–C), and
carboxyl (HO–C=O) groups (Figure 5B).29 The high-resolution
XPS peaks were analyzed using a Voigt function fitting followed by
removal of the Shirley background. The XPS survey spectrum (Figure 5C) of the prepared
catalyst clearly shows the presence of Cu 2p3/2, O 1s,
and C 1s peaks, indicating the successful preparation of the CuO/rGO
nanocomposites. Figure 5D shows the C 1s XPS spectrum of CuO/rGO nanocomposites. In the spectrum,
there is a significant decrease in the intensities of the peaks (Figure 5D), which, in turn,
prove the reduction of GO to rGO. The Cu 2p spectrum of CuO/rGO nanocomposites
(Figure 5E) shows prominent
peaks at 932.4 and 934.4 eV, corresponding to the Cu 2p3/2 peak of Cu+ and Cu2+ species. It also shows
peaks corresponding to Cu 2p1/2 at 952.3 and 954.3 eV,
which are characteristic of Cu+ and Cu2+ species.32a Further, satellite peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 were observed at 943.0 and 962.4 eV. The
binding energies of core levels are in agreement with those in previous
reports.6e,32b−32d The fitting of high-resolution
XPS data is used to quantify the atomic percentage32e (Table SI2.).

spectrum of CuO/rGO nanocomposites (E).

Figure 6 shows
the
Raman spectrum of GO (Figure 6A) and CuO/rGO nanocomposites (Figure 6B). In both spectra, two bands are clearly
observed, viz. the D band and G band. The ID/IG values for GO and CuO/rGO nanocomposites
are found to be 1.06 and 1.64, respectively. In the Raman spectrum
of CuO/rGO nanocomposites (Figure 6B), the slightly lower shift of the D band and a slightly
higher shift of the G band, along with the higher ID/IG value, prove the reduction
of GO due the incorporation of CuO NPs onto GO sheets.

Figure 6 Raman spectrum of GO
(A) and CuO/rGO nanocomposites (B).

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to study the
thermal
stability of the prepared catalyst. The TGA thermogram of GO (blue
line) shows a characteristic thermal degradation at a temperature
of around 180 °C, which is attributed to the degradation of various
functional groups.32f,32g On the other hand, the TGA thermogram
of CuO/rGO nanocomposites (red line) shows a weight loss (∼48%)
at around 335 °C, which can be ascribed to the degradation of
various functional group containing oxygen in CuO/rGO. Another weight
loss (∼3%) is observed at around 675 °C, which corresponds
to the degradation of the C–C skeleton of rGO (Figure 7).33

thermogram of GO and CuO/rGO nanocomposites.

The prepared CuO/rGO nanocomposite was then employed to show
its
catalytic activity for the synthesis of flavanones from chalcones.
We initiated our study by taking substituted 2-hydroxychalcone (1a, 1.0 mmol) as the model substrate (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Model Reaction for the Cyclization
of Chalcone to Flavanone
The experiment was performed in the absence of any catalyst,
with
water (3 mL) as the solvent at room temperature. However, the reaction
did not lead to any product even after 3 h of stirring, and only the
starting material was revealed by thin layer chromatography (TLC)
(Table 1). The same
reaction was performed in the presence of catalyst (CuO/rGO, 10 mg)
under the same condition, and the identical result was encountered
(Table 1). Then we
applied heat to the reaction, and it was observed that with increasing
temperature (50, 60, and 80 °C) the yield of the desired product
increased, but the best result (92% yield) was obtained under refluxing
conditions for 30 min (Table 1).

a The reaction
was carried out with
1 mmol 1a and 10 mg of catalyst.

b Isolated yield.

To understand the effect of copper in CuO/rGO nanocomposites,
the
model reaction was setup with graphite oxide (10 mg) and rGO (10 mg),
and a trace amount of the product was observed (Table 1, 28 and 20%). Therefore, it was concluded
that Cu is an essential component in this reaction. In order to make
the procedure more economic, screening of the catalyst concentration
was carried out. Seven sets of reactions were performed using 2-hydroxychalcone
(1a, 1 mmol) and water (3 mL) with varying catalyst loading
under standardized conditions. It was found that the yield of the
product increased with increased catalyst loading from 1 to 8 mg.
Further increase of the catalyst loading (10 to 12 mg) did not have
any impact on the product yield (Figure 8). So, it proved that 8 mg of the catalyst
was enough for the conversion of chalcone 1a to flavanone 2a in excellent yield (92%).

Figure 8 Chart showing the amount of catalyst loading.

Likewise, various polar and nonpolar
solvents were tested for the
present catalytic process, including water, ethanol, acetonitrile,
chloroform, 1,4-dioxane, and toluene. It was found that under refluxing
conditions for 30 min the polar aprotic and nonpolar solvents, such
as acetonitrile, chloroform, 1,4-dioxane, and toluene, did not have
much effect on this catalytic process (Figure 9), but polar protic solvents, such as water
and ethanol, showed better conversion (92 and 94%, respectively) of
starting material to the desired product within a time frame of 30
min at their refluxing temperature (Figure 9). Though ethanol showed a slight increase
in the product yield, we chose water as the solvent for the present
catalytic process as it is environmentally benign, green, sustainable,
and easily available. After that, we changed our focus and carried
out the reaction under solvent-free reaction conditions (neat condition)
in the presence of catalyst (8 mg). The reaction resulted in a lower
yield (19%) of the desired product even after prolonged heating for
3 h at 100 °C (Table 1).

Figure 9 Chart showing the standardization of various solvents.

After obtaining the excellent result (Table 1, entry 6), we investigated
the generality
and substrate scope for this reaction (Scheme 3). Likewise, numerous flavanones were prepared
from substituted chalcones (1a–1u) containing both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups
at o-, m-, and p-positions of the aromatic ring (Figure 10). It was found that both electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing substituents at different positions of the
aromatic ring furnished good to excellent results. Therefore, it was
concluded that the nature and position of the substituent have no
influence on the product yield. We also prepared a flavanone-containing
heterocyclic system (furan ring, 1m) and naphthalene
moiety (1l). In both cases, excellent results were encountered
(Table 2). We tried
to synthesize flavanones containing an aliphatic side chain, but much
less chalcone was formed in the case of aliphatic aldehydes, such
as butanal and propanal.

Table 3 shows the
results of some reported methodologies. From this table, it is clear
that these reported procedures suffer some drawbacks such as long
reaction time, lower yield, use of toxic, hygroscopic solvents and
reagents and use a nonrecyclable catalyst. On the other hand, we used
green and environmentally friendly solvent (water) and a recyclable
catalyst. Moreover, reaction time is short, and product yields are
very high. Therefore, the present methodology is superior to other
reported procedures.

The plausible mechanism for the
present reaction is shown in the Scheme 4. First, the catalyst
CuO/rGO increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon of the
conjugated system of 2-hydroxychalcones (1). Then hydroxyl
group of the chalcone attacked the β-position of the conjugated
part of the molecule according to Michael fashion (1A). Finally, intramolecular proton transfer (1B and 1C) followed by tautomerization furnished the final product 2.

the Present Reaction
Next we tried to synthesize flavanones containing a 1,2,3-triazole
moiety. We constructed the triazole by click reaction using alkyne
and azide. For this, chalcone containing an alkyne end was synthesized
(1n and 1o) from salicylaldehyde and propargyl
bromide (Scheme 5).
Then flavanone-enclosed alkyne moieties 2n and 2o were synthesized from chalcones 1n and 1o. In the next step, aryl azide, flavanones 2n and 2o, and catalyst were refluxed in water for 1 h.
To our delight, flavanone with triazoles 4a–4j were formed in excellent yields of 90–97% (Scheme 5 and Table 4).

(1 h).

b Isolated yield, after
column chromatography.

To
make the procedure easier, straightforward, and economically
viable, we tried to combine the two steps in a single step. So, chalcone 1n, aryl azide 3g, and CuO/rGO catalyst in water
were refluxed for 2 h (Scheme 6). After purification and characterization, it was found that
instead of flavanone-containing triazole, open chain triazole 5a was formed.

Scheme 6 Then we changed our strategy.
First chalcones 1n and 1o were converted
to flavanones 2n and 2o, and then in the
same pot, alkyl azides (3a–3f) were
added and refluxed for 1 h. It was
observed that after 1 h of reflux, flavanone-enclosed triazoles 4a–4j were formed nicely and furnished
excellent yield (90–97%). In order to show the versatility
of the present protocol, we investigated the reaction with both electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing substituted phenyl azides (Figure 11). In both cases, good to
excellent amounts of the desired products were obtained (Table 4).

Figure 11 Substrate scope for
1,2,3-triazoles.

We tried to develop
an efficient, green, and sustainable catalyst.
Therefore, reusability of the catalyst was examined. The model reaction
was setup with chalcone 1n (1 mmol), benzyl azide 3a (1 mmol), water (3 mL), and catalyst (8 mg) under the same
refluxing conditions. After completion of the reaction (TLC), the
catalyst was recovered by centrifugation followed by filtration. The
recovered catalyst was washed with water, ethanol, and diethyl ether
and dried. The recovered catalyst was then used in another seven consecutive
runs, and not much decrease in the catalytic activity was observed
(Figure 12). Further,
the structures of the flavanone and flavanone-containing triazoles 2t, 4e, and 4g were confirmed from
X-ray crystallography (Figure 13).

Figure 13 X-ray crystal structures of 2t, 4e, and 4g (CCDC numbers 1573626, 1580712, and 1580713).

A gram scale reaction was setup
with a CuO/rGO nanocomposite catalyst
to show industrial application. In our present study, chalcone 1n (4 mmol, 1113 mg) and CuO/rGO (32 mg) were stirred in 15
mL of H2O for 30 min. After that, phenyl azide 3a (4 mmol, 477 mg) was added, and the stirring was further continued
for another 1 h. After completion of the reaction (TLC), the catalyst
was recovered by centrifugation followed by filtration, and the crude
mass was purified by column chromatography. A product yield of 85%
(1.35 g) was achieved for the catalytic gram scale reaction (Scheme 7). Thus, this methodology
could be efficient for the synthesis of a triazole moiety containing
flavanone.

Scheme 7 Gram Scale Reaction
3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
developed an easy and efficient method for
the synthesis of flavanone-containing triazole moiety in one step
using substituted 2′-hydroxy acetophenones, aldehydes, aryl
azides, and CuO/rGO. After completion of the reaction, catalyst was
separated easily by centrifugation followed by filtration. Then it
was reused in seven consecutive runs. Gram scale reaction was carried
out for industrial applications. This protocol avoids the use of toxic
and hazardous solvents, costly catalysts, and long reaction times,
which in turn satisfies some principles of green chemistry.

Procedure for the Synthesis
of CuO/rGO Nanocomposites
Graphite oxide was synthesized
according to a modified Hummers method
from graphite powder.28b,28c In the second step, a mixture
of GO (30 mg), CuCl2 (18 mg), and deionized water (200
mL) was taken in a 500 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was then
ultrasonicated (50 Hz) for 1 h at room temperature. Then NaBH4 (10 mL, 1%) was added dropwise, and the reaction mixture
was stirred at 100 °C for 24 h. After that, the reaction mixture
was cooled at room temperature, and the CuO/rGO nanocomposites were
collected by centrifugation and filtration and dried at 100 °C.

Procedure for the Cyclization of Chalcones 1a–1u to Flavanones 2a–2u
In a clean round-bottom flask, chalcones 1a–1u (1 mmol) and catalyst (CuO/rGO, 8 mg) were added in water
(3 mL) and refluxed for 30 min. Then the catalyst was recovered by
filtration with water, ethanol, and diethyl ether and dried. The recovered
catalyst was then used in another set of reactions. The filtrate-containing
product was then extracted with chloroform (3 × 5 mL), and the
organic extract was washed with water (3 × 10 mL) and brine (1
× 10 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. It was then concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude mass
was then purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate and
hexane as eluent.

Procedure for the Synthesis of 1,2,3-Triazoles 4a–4j from Flavanones 2n and 2o
In a clean round-bottom flask flavanones 2n and 2o (1 mmol), aryl azides 3a–3f (1 mmol), catalyst (CuO/rGO, 8 mg), and water
(3 mL) were refluxed. After completion (TLC), the catalyst was recovered
by centrifugation and filtration, and the recovered catalyst was then
washed with water, ethanol, and diethyl ether and dried under reduced
pressure and reused for another set of reactions. The filtrate-containing
product was then extracted by chloroform (3 × 10 mL), and the
combined organic extract was washed with water (3 × 10 mL) and
brine (1 × 10 mL) and dried (Na2SO4). It
was then concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude mass was then
purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate and hexane as
eluent to afford the desired product (4a–4j).

Procedure for the Synthesis of 1,2,3-Triazoles 4a–4j from Chalcones 1n and 1o in One Pot
A mixture of chalcones 1n and 1o (1 mmol), catalyst (CuO/rGO, 8 mg), and water
(3 mL) was taken in a round-bottom flask and refluxed for 30 min.
Then aryl azides 3a–3f (1 mmol) were
added into the same reaction mixture, and refluxing was continued
for another 1 h. After that, the reaction mixture was cooled at room
temperature, and the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation followed
by filtration. The recovered catalyst was washed with water, ethanol,
and diethyl ether and dried. Then the catalyst was used in another
set of reactions. The product was extracted from the filtrate using
chloroform (3 × 5 mL), and the combined organic extract was washed
with water (3 × 10 mL) and brine (1 × 10 mL) and dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4. The organic solvent was then
evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude mass was then purified
by column chromatography using ethyl acetate and hexane as eluent.
