In
this work, we present the synthesis of original thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomers with rigid substituents (e.g., perfluorinated
chains, and aromatic groups) and demonstrate the ability to prepare
nanotubular and nanoporous structures via templateless, surfactant-free
electropolymerization in organic solvents (dichloromethane). For the
majority of synthesized monomers, including a significant amount of
water in the electropolymerization solvent leads to the formation
of nanoporous membranes with tunable size and surface hydrophobicity.
If water is not included in the electropolymerization solvent, most
of the surfaces prepared are relatively smooth. Tests with different
water contents show that the formation of nanoporous membranes pass
through the formation of vertically aligned nanotubes and that the
increase in water content induces an increase in the number of nanotubes
while their diameter and height remain unchanged. An increase in surface
hydrophobicity is observed with the formation of nanopores up to ≈300
nm in diameter, but as the nanopores further increase in diameter,
the surfaces become more hydrophilic with an observed decrease in
the water contact angle. These materials and the ease with which they
can be fabricated are extremely interesting for applications in separation
membranes, opto-electronic devices, as well as for sensors.

1 Introduction
Because
of their large surface area, nanoporous interfaces such
as nanotube arrays have gathered significant interest over recent
years. Applications of interest for these interfaces include optical
and electronic devices, sensors, as well as for the manipulation of
surface wetting properties.1−8 Similar to what has been observed and studied on natural surfaces
with nanotubular arrays (e.g., Gecko pads), both surface hydrophobicity
and water adhesion of nanoporous interfaces are highly dependent on
the geometry of nanotube arrays (e.g., diameter, height, pore size,
and spacing between nanotube features).3−8 In order to develop these well-ordered surfaces, researchers often
rely on hard or rigid templates such as anodized aluminum/titanium
membranes to direct the formation of tubular and porous features.9−13 Unfortunately, templated processes are lengthy and challenging to
implement, especially on a large scale. Furthermore, a new template
is needed for every desired modification to the surface geometry (e.g.,
changing diameter or spacing within the array).

To avoid the
need for templates, researchers have recently become
interested in using templateless electropolymerization as an alternative
and rapid approach for the preparation of highly ordered, nanotube
structures.14 As one example, electropolymerization
of pyrrole in aqueous solutions has been studied by many different
research groups.15−25 With pyrrole as the monomer, the in situ formation of porous structures
is attributed to the release of gas bubbles (H2 and/or
O2) from H2O directly during electropolymerization.
While the exploitation of this gas release is a relatively straightforward
process, a surfactant is needed to stabilize the gas bubbles so the
porous structures can readily form. More recent studies have identified
approaches that eliminate the need for surfactants and thus permit
the formation of tubular features via electropolymerization in organic
solvents (e.g., CH2Cl2). In these studies, tubular
features form only if trace H2O is present in solution.
Using this type of approach, vertically aligned nanotubes with high
water adhesion have been developed using rigid monomers such as 3,4-phenylenedioxythiophene,
naphthalenedioxythiophene, and thienothiophene derivatives.26−31

As demonstrated by prior research, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomers and associated analogues are excellent candidates
to obtain nanotubular structures as well as hollow spheres via electrodeposition.29−31 In this work, we demonstrate that with the judicious design of the
thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomer structure, it is possible
to obtain nanoporous membranes with the tunable size and surface hydrophobicity.
Rigid substituents (e.g., perfluorinated chains, aromatic groups)
were incorporated into thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomers
(Scheme 1) and their
efficacy at electropolymerization was explored. We also highlight
how the inclusion of water in the electropolymerization solvent significantly
impacts the formation of porous structures.

Scheme 1 Monomers Investigated
in This Work
2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Templateless Electropolymerization
Electropolymerizations were performed in CH2Cl2 or CH2Cl2 + H2O solutions containing
0.1 M of Bu4NClO4 and 0.01 M of the monomer
of interest. Cyclic voltammetry was chosen as the electrodeposition
method because it enables robust polymer growth at an interface and
also because it has the advantage of enabling precise characterization
of the electrochemical phenomena. This includes monomer oxidation
and polymerization, polymer oxidation and reduction, as well as water
oxidation and reduction which has been shown to be responsible for
producing O2/H2 gas bubbles.29 For the monomers synthesized in this study, the oxidation
potentials (Eox) were determined to be
≈1.54–1.70 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE),
depending on the structure. Using this information, electrodepositions
were performed from −1 V to Eox at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1. In order to observe
the polymer growth, the number of scans was varied (1, 3, or 5 scans).

Representative cyclic voltammograms for select monomers (thieno-F4, thieno-BiPh, and thieno-NaPh) are presented in Figure 1. From these voltammograms,
it is evident that the intensity of the polymer oxidation/reduction
peaks is highest for thieno-F4, thieno-Ph (not displayed),
and thieno-PhOPh (not displayed). This is likely due to steric hindrance
being the lowest with these substituents (Scheme 1). As a result, the thickness of the polymer
deposited after cyclic voltammetry is greatest for these monomers.
A small peak at ≈−0.5 V versus SCE was also detected
during the back scans with all the monomers, but this is particularly
evident when the solvent is CH2Cl2 + H2O. In prior works, this particular peak was found to be very important
for the formation of porous structures and is attributed to the formation
of H2 bubbles from H2O in solution (2H2O + 2e– → H2 (bubbles) + 2OH–).21,23 With the monomers studied here,
this peak is particularly intense in the cyclic voltammogram of thieno-NaPh
and thieno-Pyr. In the literature, it has been shown that the formation
of O2 bubbles from H2O is possible during forward
oxidation scans at roughly 1.5–2.0 V versus SCE (2H2O → O2 (bubbles) + 4H+ + 4e–), which could also contribute to the development of porous structures.
However, this process is more difficult to detect by cyclic voltammetry
because the monomer oxidation occurs at roughly the same potentials
(nmonomer → polymer + 2ne– + 2nH+) and thus cannot
be isolated in this study.

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms (5 scans) of select monomers
(thieno-F4, thieno-BiPh, thieno-NaPh) in CH2Cl2 (left hand column) and CH2Cl2 + H2O (right column) with Bu4NClO4 as the electrolyte.
Scan rate: 20 mV s–1.

2.2 Surface Properties
The surface morphologies
after electrodeposition via cyclic voltammetry (3 scans) of all monomers
in both CH2Cl2 and CH2Cl2 + H2O are highlighted in Figures 2 and 3. From these
images, it is clear that including water in the solvent mixture has
a significant impact on the surface morphology. Most notably, all
films prepared with CH2Cl2 as the solvent are
nonporous (left-hand column, Figures 2 and 3). With thieno-Ph, thieno-BiPh,
and thieno-NaPh, the surface morphology with CH2Cl2 as the solvent is ultimately very smooth. Wrinkles are observed
for thieno-Pyr surfaces as well as more subtle wrinkles (that are
less notable due to additional rough features) on thieno-F4 films. Of all electropolymerizations conducted in CH2Cl2 as the solvent, the roughest surfaces form from thieno-F4 and thieno-PhOPh (Figure 2). In these cases, the morphology consists of a high
density of spherical particles across the surface, but as noted, the
morphology is nonporous.

Figure 2 SEM images of polymer surfaces obtained from
thieno-F4, thieno-Ph, and thieno-PhOPh via cyclic voltammetry
(3 scans) and
using CH2Cl2 (left hand column) or CH2Cl2 + H2O (right column) as the solvent.

Figure 3 SEM images of polymer surfaces obtained from
thieno-BiPh, thieno-NaPh,
and thieno-Pyr via cyclic voltammetry (3 scans) and using CH2Cl2 (left hand column) or CH2Cl2 + H2O (right column) as the solvent.

In contrast to the surfaces polymerized with CH2Cl2 as the solvent, the films prepared in CH2Cl2 + H2O (right-hand columns, Figures 2 and 3) are porous.
With thieno-Ph as the monomer, the morphology consists of tubular
features, while nanoporous membranes are obtained with all other monomers.
The pore size of the membranes is smallest with thieno-BiPh (Ø ≈ 100 nm, Figure 3) and largest with thieno-PhOPh (Ø ≈ 500 nm, Figure 2). Highly packed nanopores with homogenous
distribution of the pore size (Ø ≈ 300
nm) are observed in the case of thieno-Naph. As highlighted in Figure 4, for thieno-NaPh,
the size of the pores does not vary with the number of deposition
scans.

Figure 4 SEM images of polymer surfaces obtained from electrodeposition
of thieno-NaPh in CH2Cl2 + H2O via
cyclic voltammetry after 1 (top, left), 3 (top, right), or 5 (bottom)
scans.

Surface hydrophobicity of all
surfaces after electrodeposition
was characterized via water contact angle measurements (Tables 1 and 2). The data reveal that thieno-F4 surfaces have the strongest
hydrophobic behavior, with 120° < θw <
135° regardless of the solvent employed and the number of deposition
scans (Tables 1 and 2). This result is expected, as the perfluorinated
chains on the monomer structure significantly reduce overall surface
energy. Furthermore, as demonstrated in Figure 2, rough surfaces result from electrodeposition
of thieno-F4 in CH2Cl2 and CH2Cl2 + H2O, which following either the
Cassie–Baxter or Wenzel wetting regimes of wetting will further
enhance hydrophobic behavior.

Films obtained with thieno-BiPh and thieno-NaPh in CH2Cl2 are less hydrophobic with θw ≈
85°–88°, regardless of the number of scans because
of the relative smooth nature of these surfaces (Figure 3). Films obtained from thieno-Ph,
thieno-PhOPh, and thieno-Pyr in CH2Cl2 have
intermediate surface hydrophobicity; θw increases
with the number of scans from 72° to 115°.

When the
solvent is CH2Cl2 + H2O, different
wetting behavior is observed. With thieno-BiPh, θw ≈ 80° and this value does not vary with the number
of scans as the surfaces are relatively smooth (Figure 3). With thieno-NaPh as the monomer, the nanoporous
structures have hydrophobic behavior as θw is as
great as 112.4° (5 scans). Interestingly, despite having qualitatively
similar porous features, the same is not observed for thieno-PhOPh
where hydrophobicity decreases slightly with the number of scans.
Cases of increasing θw with increasing number of
deposition scans (thieno-Ph, thieno-NaPh, thieno-Pyr) can be explained
using the aforementioned Cassie–Baxter equation. This wetting
regime assumes air is trapped inside nanoporous structures when a
water droplet is deposited onto a surface, which causes increases
in the observed θw.32 Films
with nanotubular structures (thieno-Ph) also displayed an increase
θw up 120° with increasing number of deposition
scans, indicating that air is also trapped within these features.
However, in other cases, this assumption is not valid. For example,
with thieno-PhOPh, a decrease in θw to 65.9°
after 3 scans is observed because, as mentioned previously in the
discussion, the nanopores on this surface are the largest in this
study (Ø ≈ 500 nm) and therefore, the
assumption of trapped air within these features is no longer valid.
In this case, the decrease in θw can be explained
with the Wenzel equation because the larger porous structures enable
complete penetration by water, a quality typical of Wenzel wetting.33

In order to better evaluate the influence
of the water content
on the formation of nanoporous membranes, the solvent CH2Cl2 + H2O was simply diluted by CH2Cl2. The percentages tested were 35 and 65% of CH2Cl2 + H2O versus CH2Cl2. The monomer selected was thieno-NaPh. First of all, we observe
a huge influence of the water content (Figure 5). At a low water content [CH2Cl2 + H2O (35%)], the formation of vertically
aligned nanotubes is observed. The diameter of the nanotubes was roughly
200 nm and height 300 nm. However, the number of nanotubes was not
very important. Here, when the water content increases, it was observed
a huge increase of the number of nanotubes while their diameter and
height remain unchanged [CH2Cl2 + H2O (65%)]. Here, the formation of nanoporous membranes is obtained
especially with 100% of CH2Cl2 + H2O.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrate
the ability to obtain nanotubular
and nanoporous structures using a templateless electropolymerization
method in the organic solvent (CH2Cl2) and without
the aid of a surfactant. Using thieno[3,4-b]thiophene
monomers with rigid substituents, such perfluorinated chains or aromatic
groups, nanoporous membranes were obtained when a significant fraction
of water was included in the electrodeposition solvent (e.g., CH2Cl2 + H2O). The inclusion of water in
the solvent mixture drove this surface formation, as surfaces formed
via electrodeposition in neat CH2Cl2 were relatively
smooth. We also clearly demonstrated using different water contents
that the formation of nanoporous membranes pass through the formation
of vertically aligned nanotubes and that the increase in water content
induced an increase in the number of nanotubes while their diameter
and height remained unchanged. For the nanoporous surfaces, the pore
size and the surface hydrophobicity were tunable by selection of the
appropriate monomer. For example, an increase in hydrophobicity was
observed with increasing pore size up to ≈300 nm, after which
decreasing hydrophobicity was noted. Many applications could be envisaged
for these surfaces in separation membranes, opto-electronic devices
or sensors.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Monomer
Synthesis
Thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylic
acid (thieno-COOH) was synthesized
in three steps from 3,4-dibromothiophene (Scheme 2), as reported in the literature.34−36 Then, 1.5 equiv of thieno-COOH was mixed with 1.5 equiv of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride and a catalytic amount of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine
in 20 mL of absolute acetonitrile. After stirring at ambient conditions
for 30 min, 1 equiv of the corresponding amine was introduced to the
mixture and left stirring. After 48 h, the crude product was purified
via gel chromatography (eluent: cyclohexane/diethyl ether 50:50).
The NMR details are given in the Supporting Information.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Route for Monomers Studied
4.2 Electrochemical Depositions
Electrochemical
depositions were performed using a potentiostat (Metrohm Autolab)
equipped with a three-electrode system consisting of a gold plate
(2 cm2) as the working electrode, a carbon-rod as the counter
electrode, and a SCE as the reference electrode. The electrochemical
cell was first filled with 10 mL of the solvent containing 0.1 M of
tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) as
the electrolyte, as well as 0.01 M of the monomer of interest. Two
different solvents were employed in order to better evaluate the influence
of H2O content: neat dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and dichloromethane saturated with water (CH2Cl2 + H2O). The latter was prepared by mixing
CH2Cl2 with a high amount of deionized H2O. To have precise desired H2O fraction, any additional
H2O remaining after mixing was removed by extraction. It
should be noticed that the solubility of water in dichloromethane
is very low, around 0.17 g/100 mL, which means there is around 17
mg in the electrochemical cell we used (10 mL).

After determination
of the oxidation potential (Eox) for each
synthesized monomer, templateless electrodepositions were performed
under potentiodynamic conditions via cyclic voltammetry at a scan
rate of 20 mV s–1. The total number of scans was
varied (1, 3, and 5) in order to characterize polymer growth. After
electrodeposition, substrates were washed three times in dichloromethane
to remove any unreacted monomer or nonadhered oligomers.

4.3 Surface Characterization
Surface
morphology was investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
using a JEOL 6700F microscope. Surface wettability was characterized
by goniometry using a DSA30 goniometer (Bruker) and the “drop
shape analysis system” software. Water droplets (2 μL)
were deposited onto surfaces and the apparent contact angles (θw) were determined at the triple point. Each data point presented
reflects a mean of five measurements (n = 5).
