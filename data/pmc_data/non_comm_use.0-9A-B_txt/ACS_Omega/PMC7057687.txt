In the current report,
hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) nanoparticles
were successfully prepared by means of a hard-templating method and
further modified with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) via radical polymerization.
Structural analysis, surface spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric characterization
confirmed a successful surface modification of HMS nanoparticles.
A hairy PSS was clearly visualized by high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy measurement, and it is grown on the surface of
HMS nanoparticles. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area and average pore size of HMS nanoparticles were reduced after
surface modification because of the pore-blocking effect, which indicated
that the PSS lies on the surface of nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the
PSS acts as a “nano-gate” to control the release of
curcumin which is triggered by pH. The drug-release profile of unmodified
HMS nanoparticles showed a stormed release in both pH 7.4 and 5.0
of phosphate buffer saline buffer solution. However, a slow release
(9.92% of cumulative release) of curcumin was observed at pH 7.4 when
the surface of HMS nanoparticles was modified by PSS. The kinetic
release study showed that the curcumin release mechanism from PSS@HMS
nanoparticles followed the Ritger–Peppas kinetic model, which
is the non-Fickian diffusion. Therefore, the PSS-decorated HMS nanoparticles
demonstrate potential for pH-triggered drug release transport.

Introduction
Methods have been established
to fight cancer, including surgery,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.1,2 Despite their advantages
in promoting apoptosis of almost all cancer cell lines, the chemoagents
(alkylating agents and antimetabolites) are also cytotoxic to normal
cells, damage the DNA and even the immune system, and change the normal
building blocks of RNA and DNA.3,4 Moreover, there are
at least 40 side-effects experienced by patients caused by cytotoxic
chemoagents, such as anaphylaxis, cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity,
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, and many more.5,6 Reduction
in the dose of chemoagents not only restricts their effectiveness
toward cancer cells but also leads to inadequate treatment and a slow
recovery period.7 Compared to the chemoagents,
the biologically active compounds of the medicinal plants possess
potent anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer
activity, which cure various diseases such as cancer without causing
toxicity.8 One of the safe, inexpensive,
and readily available natural compounds that have been used for an
anticancer drug is curcumin.9,10

Curcumin (diferuloylmethane)
is a naturally occurring compound
extracted from Curcuma longa plant
which possesses anticancer activity and has a variety of therapeutic
properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and
antiseptic activities.11−13 Unfortunately, curcumin lacks water solubility and
bioavailability.14,15 Therefore, the development of
a drug delivery system to deliver curcumin is mandatory in order to
improve solubility and bioavailability of curcumin, thereby increasing
its therapeutic activities. Nasrallah et al. successfully improved
the in vitro release performance of curcumin (as shown by improving
the Higuchi dissolution constant) in simulated physiological conditions
by doping the curcumin to ZnO nanoparticles.16 Encapsulation of curcumin by poly(l-lysin)-silica sol microcapsules
was enabled the production of a strong free radical scavenging activity,
which indicated the applicability of this system for poorly water-soluble
drug models.17 In addition to these examples,
various drug carriers, such as organic polymer-based [poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid),18 starch,19 lipid nanocapsules,20 microbubbles,14 gelatin/sodium alginate,21 chitosan,22 etc.],
inorganic-based (silica nanoparticles,23−25 magnetite nanoparticles,26 etc.), and hybrid organic–inorganic (vanillin–chitosan-coated
calcium ferrite,27 polymer-coated magnetite
nanoparticles,28,29 cellulose–halloysite nanotube
hydrogel,30 polymer-coated mesoporous silica,31−33 etc.), have been reported to be capable of improving activity of
curcumin. Among them, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are a
promising candidate for a drug delivery carrier because they have
a high surface area and pore volume, tunable pore diameter, are rich
in hydroxyl groups for functionalization, and are biocompatible.34 The current issues in the development of MSNs
as drug carriers are the improvement of drug storage capacity and
design of controlled- and targeted-drug release. In order to improve
the drug storage capacity of MSNs, various shapes of MSN nanostructures
are developed, such as spherical shape,23,25,31−33 nanocubes,24 rodlike nanostructures,35−37 hollow nanostructures,38−40 and so forth. The current finding demonstrates that the hollow nanostructure
of MSNs has high drug storage capacity because of the presence of
a hollow interior devoted to entrap a large quantity of drugs.

Hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) nanoparticles are one of MSNs platform
member, having a superior pore volume to provide more room for guest
molecule storage.38,40 Compared to the solid MSNs, the
HMS nanoparticle reveals unique advantages in mass diffusion and transportation
because of the presence of cavities and mesoporous shells.41 Although the HMS nanoparticle provides a large
cavity to accommodate more guest molecules, it still lacks drug release
ability as a result of weak interaction between unmodified nanoparticles
with entrapped drug molecules which limit its capability to carry
drugs to the targeted cells.42 Modification
of MSNs with polymers was reported as one such approach to protect
the entrapped guest molecules effectively from premature release and
degradation before reaching the targeted cells.43 The polymer acts as a barrier for drug release on the physiological
environment (pH = 7.4) but storm release is achieved at either cancer
cells (pH = 5.5–4.5) or their microenvironment (pH = 6.9–6.5).44

Polymers like polyelectrolytes are capable
of acting as a “nano-gate”
to control the drug release that is triggered by pH. Generally, the
polyelectrolyte-coated drug carrier-based silica nanoparticles are
composed of an assembled multilayer of positively charged poly(allylamine
hydrochloride) (PAH) and negatively charged poly(styrene sulfonate)
(PSS) as reported by previous studies.45−47 In some reports, a single
polyelectrolyte, a positively charged PAH, was employed to develop
pH-triggered drug carrier-based polymeric nanocapsules.48,49 A slow-release mechanism of curcumin which followed the Higuchi
kinetic release mechanism was observed from the PAH-based nanocapsules,
in which the maximum release of curcumin was found in basic media
rather than in acidic and neutral media. Because of the targeted-release
of drugs in the cancer environment (the pH more acidic than normal
cells),44 a negatively charged polyelectrolyte
like PSS was employed in our study. In this study, the HMS nanoparticles
were surface-modified by growing a negatively charged polyelectrolyte
PSS as a nanogate in order to control the curcumin drug release and
to give a negative surface charge under a neutral condition. This
is important to prevent the electrostatic interaction between nanoparticles
with negatively charged plasma or blood cells, which caused toxicity
during drug transport.50 In addition, surface
engineering of particles by grafting PSS could improve the in vitro
and in vivo osteoblast cell response, and enhance the cell adhesion
and differentiation because of the presence of SO3– groups.51 Recently, surface
modification of silica nanoparticles by polyelectrolytes was achieved
by physical modification, such as layer-by-layer and physical adsorption
that have weak interaction to the surface of nanoparticles. Alternatively,
radical polymerization of PSS is one of the chemical modification
methods to attach the polymer tightly on the surface of nanoparticles.
To the best of our knowledge, the growth of polyelectrolyte especially
PSS via radical polymerization on the surface of HMS nanoparticles
is not yet studied and reported. A combination of high storage capacity
of the HMS and the nanogate features of PSS will create a powerful
drug delivery carrier. Herein, we construct HMS nanoparticles and
further chemically modify them with PSS as pH-triggered drug delivery
carriers.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of HMS and PSS@HMS
The
PSS@HMS nanoparticles
were prepared through three steps of reaction as shown in Figure 1, that is, preparation
of HMS nanoparticles, silylation of HMS nanoparticles, and polymerization
of styrene sulfonate monomers on silylated-HMS surfaces. The presence
of vinyl groups on the surface of HMS nanoparticles provided active
sites for polymerization of styrene sulfonate which promoted by the
radical reaction. AIBN is a powerful radical initiator for promoting
a radical polymerization under mild temperature conditions. The polymerization
was terminated by adding cold methanol into the suspension. In the
last steps, the sodium ion was ionic-exchanged to form PSS.

Figure 1 Synthesis illustration
of PSS@HMS nanoparticles.

Both HMS and PSS@HMS nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for functional group analysis.
The FTIR spectra of HMS as depicted in Figure 2a shows typical peaks of Si–O and
O–H stretching vibration at around 1100 and 3400 cm–1, respectively. Peaks at around 1700 and 1400 cm–1 are characteristic of C=O and C=C stretching vibration,
respectively. Decorating PSS onto HMS surfaces can be proven by the
presence of asymmetric and symmetric vibration of S=O groups
at around 1170 and 1040 cm–1, respectively. This
data confirms that the presence of a new functional group associated
with PSS functional groups is found on the PSS@HMS sample. Therefore,
it can be assumed that the PSS was successfully grown on the HMS surfaces.

Figure 2 (a) ATR–FTIR
spectra and (b) low-angle XRD patterns of HMS
and PSS@HMS.

The structure of HMS and PSS@HMS
nanoparticles were compared by
low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. Figure 2b reveals the low angle XRD patterns of HMS
and PSS@HMS, which confirms that both HMS and PSS@HMS nanoparticles
have similar patterns to MCM-41. At a glance, the PSS@HMS XRD pattern
appears almost identical to that of unmodified HMS nanoparticles.
It implies the mesostructure of HMS preserved after modification.
However, there is a shift of 2θ at ca. 2.1–2.3°
after modification (silylation and growing PSS on the HMS surfaces).
The d100-basal spacing of HMS is found
to be 42.05 Å. Functionalization and introduction of PSS on the
HMS surfaces decrease the d100-basal spacing
to 38.83 Å. It can be attributed to the formation of a siloxane
network of TMPMA between the (100) planes of HMS. The shift and decrease
in intensity of the XRD peak for PSS@HMS nanoparticles signify that
modification occurs not only in the surface of HMS nanoparticles but
also inside their pore channels which affects the size of the average
pore diameter.52

Figure 3 shows X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of HMS and PSS@HMS. The peaks
appearing at a binding energy of 532.5, 154.5, and 103.5 eV are attributed
to the O 1s, Si 1s, and Si 2p electrons, respectively, detected at
both HMS and PSS@HMS XPS spectra. New peaks were observed on the PSS@HMS
XPS spectra at a binding energy of 284.5 and 167.5 eV associated with
C 1s and S 2p, respectively, confirming the presence of PSS in the
HMS surfaces. Accordingly, the Si 2p core-level XPS spectra of PSS@HMS
as shown in Figure 3b reveals three chemical bonding states, Si–O, Si–O–C,
and Si–C located at each binding energy of 102.1, 102.7, and
103.27 eV, that appeared on PSS@HMS surfaces.53,54 A deconvolution of C 1s core-level XPS spectra (Figure 3c) shows characteristic signals
of C=O (sp2 288.1 eV), which correspond to the carbonyl
group of TMPMA. The other two signals are C–C (sp3 285.1 eV) and C=C (sp2 283.9 eV), assigned for
a backbone chain and benzene ring of PSS.55,56 In addition, a weak signal at 167.5 eV, which is only found at PSS@HMS
XPS spectra, is a characteristic peak of S 2p of −SO3Na, the side groups of PSS. The deconvolution S 2p core-level XPS
spectra (Figure 3d)
indicates two signals at a binding energy of 167.3 eV (S 2p3/2) and 168.5 (S 2p1/2) assigned for the −SO3Na characteristic peak.57 The presence
of these peaks designated that the PSS successfully anchored to the
HMS surfaces. It is also supported by elemental analysis (Table S1) generated from XPS spectra, showing
that the S atom is only found in PSS@HMS by 2.17%.

and PSS@HMS nanoparticles. (b) Si 2p, (c)
C 1s, and (d) S 2p core-level XPS spectra of PSS@HMS nanoparticles.

Previously, the structural and surface characterization
confirmed
that the PSS was successfully grown on the surface of HMS nanoparticles.
In order to support these data, a thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)
characterization was performed as one of the powerful tools for semiquantitative
analysis, analyzing the presence of PSS on the surface of HMS nanoparticles.
As shown in Figure 4, HMS nanoparticles demonstrate one consecutive weight loss meanwhile
PSS@HMS nanoparticles have three. The HMS nanoparticles exhibit a
weight loss of about 18% in the temperature range 30–100 °C
with an endothermic reaction, indicating a loss of water molecules.
A monotonical decrease is found and it reaches a plateau at above
300 °C, corresponding to removal of water molecules entrapped
inside the pore structure and hollow interior. A loss of water molecules
is also observed in the PSS@HMS nanoparticle TGA curve of about 11%
and undergoes an insignificant decrease until a temperature of around
300 °C. A second stage degradation of about 8% occurs in the
temperature range 300–480 °C, which is a contribution
from desulfonation and destruction of the PSS backbone.58 The third step is an exothermic reaction of
the silane compound and side-chain degradation occurred in the temperature
range 504–544 °C.

Morphology and Textural Properties
Field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) analysis are intensely used to study the morphology
of materials, and they are powerful tools to help in visualizing the
structure of nanoparticles.59 An FESEM
image of HMS nanoparticles (Figure 5a) shows well-shaped spherical nanoparticles with an
average particle size of 81.45 ± 17.21 nm. A hollow interior
of HMS nanoparticles is clearly visible in the center and edge of
the nanoparticles as depicted in the inset image of Figure 5a. In addition, the HMS nanoparticles
have uniform particle size distribution as shown in Figure 5b. Silylation and further polymerization
of PSS on the surface of HMS nanoparticles do not gradually change
their morphology. However, the nanoparticles appear to stick together
as observed in Figure 5c. The hairy PSS is noticeably observed by HRTEM measurement (Figure 5d) on the surface
of HMS.

Figure 5 (a) FESEM image (insert image indicates HRTEM of HMS nanoparticles,
scale bar = 20 nm) and (b) particle size distribution of HMS nanoparticles.
(c) SEM image and (d) HRTEM image of PSS@HMS nanoparticles.

The previous result has described the structural
and morphological
characteristics of HMS and PSS@HMS nanoparticles. However, in order
to confirm the mesoporous properties of both nanoparticles, it is
important to perform the N2 adsorption–desorption
characterization. The result (Figure 6) reveals a type IV of the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm for both HMS and PSS@HMS nanoparticles, indicating a characteristic
of mesoporous materials with capillary pore geometry. The distinction
between these two nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
lies in their hysteresis loop because of the presence of PSS on the
surface of HMS nanoparticles. It also affects the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and the average pore diameter of HMS nanoparticles.
HMS nanoparticles have a high BET surface area of 1116.66 m2 g–1 with a regular pore diameter of 18.86 Å.
Functionalization and growing PSS in the surface of HMS nanoparticles
gradually decrease the BET surface area to 519.53 m2 g–1. The polymer backbone of PSS may completely cover
the surface of HMS nanoparticles as observed in the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm which was also supported by TEM measurement. Consequently,
the average pore diameter of PSS@HMS nanoparticles decreases to 16.84
Å. The same results were also found by previous research after
modifying, grafting, or decorating the surface of nanoparticles either
by polymer, silane compounds, or organic moieties.23,60

Figure 6 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of HMS and
PSS@HMS. The inset images indicate the pore size distribution of each
nanoparticle.

Figure 7 shows the
hydrodynamic particle size of PSS@HMS nanoparticles measured under
various pH conditions of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution (pH
= 3–7). The data clarifies that the nanostructure size of PSS@HMS
dynamically changes as a consequence of the pH values. The average
hydrodynamic particle size of PSS@HMS was found to be 344.2 nm (PDI
= 0.398) at pH 7, but increased to be 425.5 nm (pH 6, PDI = 0.434),
405.6 nm (pH 5, PDI = 0.383), 546.1 nm (pH 4, PDI = 0.495), and 438.9
nm (pH 3, PDI = 0.420). The increasing hydrodynamic particle size
of PSS@HMS nanoparticles is because of the structural conformation
of the hairy PSS polymer which is affected by pH of the environment.
As revealed in TEM measurements, the hairy PSS polymers are found
to stick to the surface of the nanoparticles. By increasing the pH,
the polymer backbone expands in all directions (as illustrated in
the inset image in Figure 7) because of electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged
polymer. Consequently, the hydrodynamic particle size of PSS@HMS nanoparticles
increases under acidic conditions.

Figure 7 Hydrodynamic particle size of PSS@HMS
nanoparticles measured by
the DLS method at various buffered-pH solutions.

As shown in Figure S3, the zeta (ζ)-potential
of PSS@HMS nanoparticles is −29.00 ± 0.75 mV (PDI = 0.398)
at pH 7 of PBS solution. It indicates a moderately stable suspension
which reflects a good dispersibility. Because the nanoparticles have
relatively high ζ-potential as a function of pH, the PSS@HMS
nanoparticles are difficult to agglomerate which directly minimize
their toxicity.61,62 The ζ-potential, also known
as electro kinetic potential, not only reflects the suspension stability
of materials but also indicates the surface charge of nanoparticles.63 The surface charge of PSS@HMS nanoparticles
at pH 7 of PBS solution is negative, thereby minimizing the electrostatic
interaction with the negative charge of plasma or blood cells. The
pH value of PBS solution influenced the surface charge of PSS@HMS
nanoparticles. The ζ-potential of nanoparticles becomes more
positive in acidic solution because of the protonation of PSS. This
positive charge makes nanoparticles easily penetrate the cancer cells
(acidic environment).

In Vitro Release Study of Curcumin
To investigate the
pH-dependent drug release of HMS and PSS@HMS, the in vitro drug release
experiment was carried out at two different pH values, that is, pH
= 7.4 and 5.0 as representative of physiological and cancer environment
conditions.43,44 The drug release study was monitored
for both unmodified HMS and PSS@HMS nanoparticles. There is no initial
burst release of curcumin observed in both nanoparticles as shown
in Figure 8. The cumulative
release of curcumin from all of nanoparticles is less than 50% even
when the experiment was carried out until 43 h. The drug release profiles
of curcumin-loaded HMS (HMS-Cur) nanoparticles at the two different
pH values show an insignificant difference. It indicates that the
HMS without modification is unable to control the drug release which
triggered by pH. On the contrary, a very slow curcumin drug-release
profile (9.92%, ca. = 1.79 mg L–1) is achieved at
pH 5.0, while a storm release (22.27%, ca. = 4.03 mg L–1) is clearly observed at pH 7.4 for PSS@HMS nanoparticles. This finding
proves that the polyelectrolyte PSS acts as a barrier to prevent premature
release of drugs from the drug carrier, the so-called “nano-gate”.45,46

Figure 8 In
vitro release profile of HMS-Cur and PSS@HMS-Cur at pH 7.4 and
5.0.

The mechanism of drug release
of curcumin from PSS@HMS nanoparticles
can be explained based on the structural behavior of PSS toward the
pH. It was previously described from dynamic light scattering (DLS)
analysis that by decreasing pH (acid condition), the polymer backbone
of PSS expanded due to a high positive charge (ζ-potential =
+35.66, Figure S3). It enables the curcumin
molecules to easily escape from the PSS@HMS nanoparticles. Moreover,
the hydrogen bonding between PSS and curcumin is disturbed at low
pH, in which the sulfonate group is protonated. A similar mechanism
was also proposed by Nasab et al., in which they prepared chitosan-capped
MSNs as pH-responsive drug carriers.31 At
low pH, the ionizable functional groups of the polymer are protonated,
creating a cationic polyelectrolyte. Consequently, the polymer is
swelled because of its repulsive force between the positively charged
chains. In this state, the number of released curcumin increases.

Kinetic Study of Curcumin Release
The study of kinetic
drug release is critically important to understand the drug-release
mechanism along with better prediction of the in vitro and even in
vivo temporal drug release from host materials. Ritger–Peppas
and Higuchi kinetic release models were considered to mathematically
study the release mechanism and kinetic release rate of curcumin from
HMS and PSS@HMS nanoparticles.64−66 Nonlinear fitting data to the
models is shown in Figure S4 and the parameters’
values are presented in Table 1. According to the Ritger–Peppas model, the drug-release
mechanism for a spherical sample is divided into three categories
based on the diffusion exponent (n) value, that is, n ≤ 0.43 (Fickian diffusion), 0.43 < n < 1 (anomalous (non-Fickian) transport), and n = 1 (zero-order release). All of the nanoparticles reveal the diffusion
exponent (n) value between 0.43 and 1 which indicates
the non-Fickian drug-release mechanism, except for the curcumin released
from HMS at pH 7.4 of PBS solution which follows the Fickian release
mechanism. The data shows that the release mechanism of curcumin from
HMS nanoparticles strongly depends on the pH of the environment as
a driving force for curcumin diffusion from the HMS nanostructure
to the PBS solution. Meanwhile, the curcumin release mechanism of
PSS@HMS nanoparticles is influenced not only by the media environment
but also by the structural behavior of the PSS polymer chain at different
pH values. It was previously discussed that the polymer chain of PSS
expanded in an acidic medium and shrank at neutral pH (illustrated
in Figure 7). This
phenomenon supports the kinetic release mechanism of PSS@HMS which
follows the non-Fickian release mechanism according to the Ritger–Peppas
model. In order to confirm the Fickian release mechanism of HMS at
pH 7.4, the Higuchi kinetic model is studied. The Higuchi model fits
to demonstrate the Fickian release mechanism and is frequently applied
to describe the drug-release mechanism from the thin-film ointment.67,68 Nevertheless, this model also can be used for spherical systems
as reported by previous research.16,17,48,49 As expected, the correlation
coefficient (R2) of the Higuchi model
for curcumin release from HMS nanoparticles at pH = 7.4 is higher
than that of other systems. This strongly confirms that the curcumin
release mechanism of HMS nanoparticles (pH = 7.4) follows Fickian
diffusion (obeys the Fick’s law).

Table 1 also shows
the Ritger–Peppas kinetic release rate (k)
and Higuchi dissolution (kH) constants.
The k value of PSS@HMS nanoparticles is lower than
unmodified-HMS nanoparticles at both pH 5.0 and 7.4 which indicates
a slow release rate of curcumin. The k value depends
on the structural and geometrical characteristics of particles.68 Therefore, the release rate of curcumin from
PSS@HMS nanoparticles slows down because of the presence of PSS on
the surface of nanoparticles which extend the diffusion rate of curcumin
from one site to another site until it releases to the PBS medium.
In this study, the Higuchi dissolution constant (kH) is also measured. It can be found that the kH of PSS@HMS at pH 5.0 is 5.6515% h–1 two times higher than that at pH 5.0. The kH value depends on the particle size, where it increases with
the increase in the hydrodynamic particle size.48 As shown in Figure 7, the hydrodynamic particle size of PSS@HMS at pH 5.0 is higher
than that of PSS@HMS nanoparticles measured at pH 7.0.

Conclusions
In summary, HMS nanoparticles, fabricated by hard-templating methods,
were successfully decorated by PSS via radical polymerization which
was confirmed by structural analysis, surface spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric
and morphological studies. The presence of PSS on the surface of HMS
can be visualized by HRTEM measurements like a hair sticking on the
surface of HMS nanoparticles. Modification of HMS nanoparticles by
growing PSS on their surface affects their textural properties by
decreasing the BET surface area and reducing the average pore size.
Nevertheless, the BET surface area of PSS@HMS nanoparticles is still
higher, fulfilling the requirement as a drug carrier. It is proved
by a high loading capacity of up to 85.48%. The presence of PSS as
a nanogate on the surface of HMS nanoparticles enables them to control
the drug release of curcumin triggered by pH, which cannot be achieved
by unmodified-HMS nanoparticles. The in vitro drug release study of
curcumin from PSS@HMS nanoparticles revealed that a slow release of
curcumin was found under physiological conditions, but it was stormed
out under acidic conditions. The kinetic release study demonstrated
that the Ritger–Peppas drug release model played a role in
determining the release mechanism of curcumin from nanoparticles,
in which the release of curcumin from PSS@HMS was followed by non-Fickian
diffusion in both pH 7.4 and 5.0.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of HMS Nanoparticles
HMS nanoparticles were
prepared by the hard-templating method. The as-prepared solid template, l-serine-capped magnetite nanoparticles (l-ser@MNP
procedure available in Supporting Information), was added into stabilized surfactant micelle solution, which was
prepared by adding 0.125 g hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide into
a mixture solution of ethanol (3 mL) and distilled water (60 mL) at
80 °C for 1 h, pH = 10 adjusted by NH4OH. The mixture
was stirred for 1 h at 800 rpm. Afterward, 50 μL of TEOS was
wisely added to the suspension and stirred for 20 h. The intermediate
product was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water,
and redispersed in methanol for template removal. To the suspension,
2 mL of HCl was added and stirred overnight (this procedure was repeated
twice). Then, the HMS nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation,
washed several times with distilled water, and dried by a freeze-drying
machine. The HMS nanoparticles were structurally characterized by
attenuated total reflectance FTIR (ATR–FTIR, PerkinElmer Spectrum
400), low angle powder XRD (Rigaku MiniFlex600), XPS (Quantera SXM-GS),
and TGA (STA Lineises PT-1600). The morphology of the nanoparticles
was observed by FESEM (Hitachi S-4800) and HRTEM (JEOL JEM-2100).
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was measured
to determine the BET surface area and pore size of the nanoparticles.

Synthesis of PSS-Decorated HMS Nanoparticles
Two step
reactions were involved in the synthesis of PSS-anchored HMS nanoparticles,
namely, silylation and polymerization. About 0.1 g of HMS nanoparticles
were dispersed in 50 mL of toluene and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Then, 48 μL (0.2 mmol) of 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate
(TMPMA, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the suspension and refluxed for
24 h. The silylated HMS was collected by centrifugation and washed
with fresh toluene, ethanol, and distilled water, sequentially. Then,
it was redispersed in 5 mL of distilled water. Afterward, 70 μL
of N,N′-azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN, 15% in acetone, Sigma-Aldrich) was dropped and mildly stirred
at 70 °C for 10 min. About 0.2072 g (1 mmol) of sodium-4-vinyl
benzene sulfonate (Na-VBS, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 5 mL distilled
water and directly added into the suspension. Polymerization was terminated
by adding cold methanol after 20 h of reaction. The product was soaked
in 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl overnight and collected by centrifugation. The
PSS-decorated HMS nanoparticles (denoted as PSS@HMS) were repeatedly
washed with distilled water and dried using a freeze-drying machine.
Then, the PSS@HMS nanoparticles were characterized by using techniques
such as FTIR, low-angle XRD, XPS, TG/DSC, FESEM, HRTEM, N2 adsorption–desorption. The hydrodynamic particle size and
zeta potential of the PSS@HMS nanoparticles were evaluated by a Zetasizer
(Malvern).

Study of in Vitro Release of Curcumin
Adsorption of
curcumin was performed under room temperature. About 0.1 g of nanoparticles
was added into 20 mL of curcumin solution (200 mg L–1 in ethanol/water 3:7) and stirred for 24 h. Afterward, the nanoparticles
were collected by centrifugation and the remaining solution was measured
using UV–vis spectrophotometry (U-4100 Hitachi) to determine
the loaded amount of curcumin. The adsorption efficiency of HMS and
PSS@HMS nanoparticles toward curcumin was found to be 83.52 and 85.48%
(Table S2).

The release of curcumin
from nanoparticles carried out under two conditions, PBS solution
pH = 7.4 and pH = 5.0. About 10 mg of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles
were soaked in PBS solution and shaken at 200 rpm. The supernatant
(10 mL) was collected and measured by UV–vis spectroscopy (U-4100
Hitachi) to determine the release amount of curcumin. The cumulative
release of curcumin from either HMS or PSS@HMS was defined as the
amount of curcumin released into solution per amount of curcumin adsorbed
onto nanoparticles.
