Here, we propose a waveguide-integrated
plasmonic Schottky photodetector (PD) operating based on an internal
photoemission process with a titanium nitride plasmonic material.
The theoretically examined structure employs an asymmetric metal–semiconductor–metal
waveguide configuration with one of the electrodes being gold and
the second being either gold, titanium, or titanium nitride. For the
first time, we measured a Schottky barrier height of 0.67 eV for titanium
nitride on p-doped silicon, which is very close to the optimal value
of 0.697 eV. This barrier height will enable photodetection with a
high signal-to-noise ratio when operating at a wavelength of 1550
nm. In addition to the measured optical properties of high absorption
losses and reasonably large real part of the permittivity that are
desired for this type of PD, titanium nitride is also compatible with
easy integration on existing complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor
technology. The use of titanium nitride results in a shorter penetration
depth of the optical mode into the metal when compared to Ti, which
in turn enhances the probability for transmission of hot electrons
to the adjacent semiconductor, giving rise to an enhancement in responsivity.

Introduction
Photodetectors (PDs) are one
of the basic building blocks of an optoelectronic link that converts
light into an electrical signal. On-chip monolithic optoelectronic
integration requires the development of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor
(CMOS)-compatible PDs that operate in the telecom wavelengths (1.1–1.7
μm).1−3 While sensitivity
is the most important attribute for PDs in long-distance communications,
for short-distance interconnects, the most critical factor is the
total energy dissipated per bit. The optical energy received at the
PD is directly related to the transmitter optical output power and
the total link loss, which includes the coupling losses, the link
attenuation, and additionally, a power margin. Hence, for 10 fJ/bit
transmitted optical energy, the received optical energy could be 1
fJ/bit.3 Thus, minimizing the optical losses
at the PD is crucial for optimizing the performance of the overall
system.

PDs usually operate on the basis of the photoelectric
effect or exhibit an electrical resistance dependent on the incident
radiation. The principle is based on the absorption of photons and
the subsequent separation of the photogenerated charge carriers—electron–hole
(e–h) pairs.4 However, this approach
does not work for near-infrared (NIR) light in Si because the NIR
photon energies (0.79–0.95 eV) have no sufficient energy to
overcome the Si band gap (1.12 eV). In the case of Ge-based PDs (band
gap 0.67 eV), the small PD detection area limits the response.4 An alternative approach utilizes the intrinsic
absorption of the metal for photodetection that is accomplished by
internal photoemission (IPE) in a Schottky diode.5−10 In this configuration,
the photoexcited (“hot”) carriers in the metal are emitted
to the semiconductor/insulator over a potential ΦB, called the Schottky barrier, that exists at the metal–semiconductor
(MS) interface.

In the semiconductor/insulator, the injected
carriers are accelerated by the electric field present in the depletion
region of the Schottky diode and then collected as a photocurrent
at the external electrical contacts. Usually, the Schottky barrier
is lower than the band gaps of most semiconductors, thus allowing
photodetection of NIR photons with energy hν
> ΦB. The process of photon-induced emission of
electrons from metals and its collection was described by Spicer.11,12 It is based on the Fowler proposal and consists of a three-step
model: (1) generation of hot electrons in the metal through the absorption
of photons, (2) diffusion of a portion of the hot electrons to the
MS/insulator interface before thermalization, and (3) injection of
the hot electrons with sufficient energy and correct momentum into
the conduction band of the semiconductor/insulator through IPE.

To optimize the efficiency of the IPE process, the optical power
should be confined at the boundary between the materials forming the
Schottky barrier. This allows for an increased interaction of the
light with the metal in a very close vicinity of the interface where
the photoemission process takes place. The solution for this is well
known and is called a surface plasmon polariton (SPP). The SPPs are
guided optical surface waves propagating along the boundary between
the metal and dielectric with a maximum field located at this interface
and decaying exponentially in both media.13,14 One
of the main advantages of SPP emanates from the fact that it is not
diffraction-limited while tightly confining the optical field to deep
subwavelength dimensions. SPP offers a long interaction length between
the propagating mode and the PD, and therefore, a larger portion of
the optical energy can be absorbed adjacent to the Schottky barrier
from where it is collected.

Plasmonic elements including PDs
have been suggested as an alternative technology to overcome the scaling
limitations of conventional photonic components.15 They offer high integration densities, low device capacitance
for higher bandwidth operation, and operation with ultralow energies.
SPPs can decay either radiatively via emission of photons or nonradiatively
through the generation of excited (hot) carriers. The photoexcited
hot carriers with sufficient energy have the possibility to overcome
the potential barrier between the metal and the semiconductor, leading
to a measurable current through light-induced charge separation. The
potential barrier can be overcome either directly by the high-energy
electrons or through quantum mechanical tunneling. The probability
of tunneling depends on the barrier width and height as well as the
charge carrier energy.

Results and Discussion
The considered arrangement consists of a metal–semiconductor–metal
(MSM) structure with the semiconductor Si placed between the metals
(see Figure 1), similar
to the one presented in ref (5). For this plasmonic waveguide structure, the electric field
of the propagating mode reaches maxima at both MS interfaces and decays
exponentially into the semiconductor, with the electromagnetic energy
distributed across the metal and semiconductor. The relative amount
of energy in the metal and the semiconductor depends on the optical
properties of the material and the waveguiding geometry. The penetration
depth of light into the metal, that is, the skin depth, depends on
the optical properties of the metal.13,14 A large negative
real part of the permittivity, which is a consequence of large plasma
frequency because of larger carrier concentration, gives rise to a
small penetration of the field into the metal, whereas a small imaginary
part of the permittivity leads to lower absorption in the metal.13,14 Therefore, it can be deduced that the field penetration into the
metal influences the trade-off between confinement and propagation
losses—that is, less light in the metal results in more inside
the dielectric what lowers
the absorption losses and confinement of the mode.

for photodetection with the light coupled from the Si waveguide to
the MSM junction, which is biased with an external voltage.

Here, we
examine TiN as a replacement for Ti as it shows much better plasmonic
behavior and, consequently, is able to confine the absorbed energy
much closer to the MS interface. As a result, the hot carriers have
much higher probability to be transferred across the Schottky barrier.
The probability of hot carrier transfer increases significantly for
metals with low Fermi level. To calculate the probability of hot electron
injection to the semiconductor over the potential barrier requires
finding a relation between the lateral wavevector, k||m, which is continuous across the boundary, and the
wavevectors, kzm and kzs, that is, the wavevectors in the metal and semiconductor,
respectively, that are normal to the interface30      Here, EF = h̵2kF2/2m0 is the Fermi energy, kF is
the Fermi wavevector, m0 is the mass of
the electron in the metal, and ms is the
effective mass of the electron in the semiconductor. Only the hot
electrons with the lateral wavevector, k||m, less than kmax, have a finite probability
to be transferred over the Schottky barrier. The hot electrons which
can be injected into the semiconductor have a cone of allowed wavevectors
given by sin2 θ = kmax2/kF2. Inside the
cone, the probability of IPE of a hot electron that is generated by
a photon with energy h̵ω is given by30  

Among many metals commonly
used in plasmonics, TiN possesses the lowest Fermi energy (EF = 4.2 eV) that makes it favorable for this
type of photodetection. Furthermore, good plasmonic properties comparable
with that of Au make TiN an ideal candidate as a replacement for Au
and development of CMOS-compatible PDs.

The operation principle
is based on the intrinsic absorption of metals that is accomplished
by IPE.5−10 The absorbed photons in the metal create hot carriers that are transmitted
across a potential barrier at the MS interface. Plasmonics is an ideal
approach for realizing such PDs as a metal stripe can be used both
to act as an electrode and to support the plasmonic mode, with the
mode field strongly localized at the MS interface where it reaches
its maximum. Thus, light is perfectly concentrated in the region where
its absorption leads to the highest generation rate of photoelectrons.
To minimize the dark current in the presented MSM configuration, one
of the metal electrodes needs to act more as an absorbent compared
to the other. Hence, an asymmetric MSM structure is highly desired,
where the light is mostly absorbed in one MS interface.

The
band diagram of an asymmetric MSM, Au–Si–TiN, PD junction
is sketched in Figure 2 with the plasmonic mode guided between the metal contacts (Figure 1). In this junction,
the SPP mode mostly dissipates its energy at the Si–TiN interface
where hot electrons are created in the TiN metal by the absorbed photons.22−25 When
the maximum carrier energies exceed the Fermi energy, the hot electrons
have an increased probability of crossing the potential barrier at
the TiN–Si interface. Also, if the Schottky barrier height
at the second MS interface (Au–Si) exceeds that of the TiN–Si
interface, the built-in potential difference φbi across
the silicon core impedes electron photoemission. Therefore, no significant
current flow can be observed. For an applied voltage to the Au–TiN
electrodes, when a positive potential at the Au electrode exceeds
φbi, the photoemission from TiN is enabled.

In this paper, we examine the impact of different metal materials
such as gold (Au), titanium (Ti), and titanium nitride (TiN) on the
performances of the PD. Gold has been the metal of choice for most
plasmonic components.13,14 However, it has a relatively
low melting temperature, low mechanical durability, high surface energies,
and incompatibility with standard CMOS fabrication.16,17 These
major drawbacks have limited its commercial uptake in many potential
applications. In contrast, Ti and TiN are CMOS-compatible and are
characterized by high melting temperature, extreme mechanical durability,
and low surface energy.16 Furthermore,
TiN shows optical properties similar to those of gold, which makes
it attractive for many applications.16−19 In our MSM PD arrangement,
the left electrode is chosen to be Au, while the second electrode
changes between Au (symmetric MSM)25 and
Ti and TiN (asymmetric MSM).26

For
the optical characterization, thin 100 nm-thick films of TiN were
deposited on the SiO2 substrate by dc reactive magnetron
sputtering from a 99.99% titanium target in an argon–nitrogen
environment. To achieve a “metallic” TiN, the deposition
rate and substrate temperature were kept constant at 1.38 nm/min and
150 °C, respectively. After deposition, the optical constants
of the TiN films were extracted from variable angle spectroscopic
ellipsometry measurements performed at room temperature over a spectral
range of 400–1700 nm with the dielectric functions fitted to
the Drude–Lorentz model. By slightly changing the deposition
rate and substrate temperature, the TiN optical properties can be
tuned.18,19 Finally, the dielectric functions were compared
with gold and titanium. As observed, Au shows the highest negative
real part of permittivity, while the imaginary part is the lowest
among the presented materials. In comparison, Ti shows a very small
negative real part of permittivity, while the imaginary part is higher
compared to that of Au. In the case of TiN, it shows a similar real
part as Au, while the imaginary part of permittivity for sample TiN
2018 is higher for longer wavelengths compared to that for sample
TiN 2014.18,19 It is a consequence of slightly higher oxygen
incorporation during a fabrication process.

To characterize
the electrical properties of TiN–Si contacts, we measured the
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for TiN deposited on both n-doped (n = 2–4 Ω·cm) and p-doped (n =
10–20 Ω·cm) silicon. The TiN thickness was h = 50 nm for both samples for which a sheet resistance
was measured at 50 Ω/sq. (ρ = 2.5 × 104 Ω·cm), while its diameter changed from d = 100 μm to d = 200 μm. A ring-shaped
Au structure was used as the top contact on the TiN/p-Si device. The
substrate was used as the bottom contact (inset in Figure 3b).

Figure 3 Measured current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the fabricated TiN–Si
junction
(inset in b) for different TiN contact areas—diameter d = 100 μm and d = 200 μm.
Schottky barrier heights of ΦB = 0.35 eV and ΦB = 0.67 eV for (a) n-doped and (b) p-doped Si, respectively.

For a Schottky PD,
the barrier height is a very important parameter. Values for the barrier
heights of Au and Ti were taken from the literature,5,7,20 while for TiN, its value was
extracted from our I–V measurements
(Figure 3). The dark
current of a Schottky diode is expressed by  where S is the contact area, A*
is the effective Richardson constant, ΦB is the Schottky
barrier height, and V is the applied voltage.

As can be observed from Figure 3, the smaller contact area results in a smaller dark
current. However, this behavior is more pronounced for TiN on n-doped
Si (Figure 3a) because
of the lower Schottky barrier height when compared to that for TiN
on p-doped Si as more carriers can flow from TiN to Si. For TiN–p-Si
(Figure 3b), the device
shows a rectifying behavior with the forward bias current limited
by the series resistance of the contact (RS = 822 Ω). The dark current of 8.1 nA was measured for a reverse
bias of 0.1 V. The ideality factor was calculated to be n = 1.3. For the TiN–n-Si contact (Figure 3a), the series resistance of the contact
was calculated to be RS = 110 Ω,
while the dark current was around 0.46 μA for a bias voltage
of −0.1 V. The ideality factor was calculated to be 1.3. The
Schottky barriers deducted from the curves were ΦTiN = 0.35 eV for n-Si and ΦTiN = 0.67 eV for p-Si.
The inset in Figure 3b shows the measurement setup.

The barrier heights for Au on
n-Si- and p-Si-type substrates were taken at ΦAu =
0.8 eV and ΦAu = 0.32 eV, respectively, while those
for Ti were taken at ΦTi = 0.5 eV for n-Si and ΦTi = 0.61 eV for p-Si.

Thus, for the n-Si core-based
MSM structure, the calculated, established built-in potential differences
across the core are φbi = 0.3 eV and φbi = 0.45 eV for Au–Si–Ti and Au–Si–TiN,
respectively. For p-doped Si, the corresponding potential difference
is φbi = −0.29 eV for Au–Si–Ti
and φbi = −0.35 eV for Au–Si–TiN.
A negative potential sign means a lower Schottky barrier at the Au
interface compared to the second interface—Ti–Si or
TiN–Si. It should be mentioned here that the Schottky barrier
height between Au and p-doped Si differs greatly from the data presented
in ref (5) where the
Schottky barrier height was taken as ΦAu = 0.82 eV.
However, even references provided in this paper suggest that this
value refers to n-doped Si rather than p-Si.21 Consequently, the built-in potential difference of φbi = 0.2 eV in Au–(p-Si)–Ti used in the literature5 is not proper. However, the presented results
constitute an excellent step in the realization of future waveguide-integrated
PDs.

When light is coupled to the MSM plasmonic waveguide, it
dissipates its energy at both MS interfaces. The amount of power absorbed
at a given interface depends on the metal’s optical properties—the
larger the magnitude of the imaginary part of the complex permittivity,
the larger the absorption. The device geometry was simulated for 1550
nm appropriate to telecom application by using the two-dimensional
finite element method (FEM) with COMSOL. The FEM is a well-established
technique for the numerical solution of partial differential equations
or integral equations, where the region of interest is subdivided
into small segments and the partial differential equation is replaced
with a corresponding functional. In our calculations, the complex
permittivities of Au, Ti, and TiN18,19 were taken
at the wavelength of 1550 nm.18,19 As the probability of
hot electron transfer to a semiconductor depends strongly on the position
in the metal where the electrons are generated, the penetration depths
of the SPP electric field in the metal dm should be considered. The penetration depth can be expressed by  where εm′ and εd are the real
part of metal permittivity and dielectric, respectively.
As TiN provides a higher negative real part of permittivity compared
to Ti,18,19 the electric field penetration depth into
the metal is lower. Thus, hot carriers are generated closer to the
MS interface which enhances the probability of hot carrier transfer
to a semiconductor. As a result, the proposed arrangement can provide
better performances compared to the MIM arrangement with one of the
electrodes being Ti.5Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the longitudinal component of the electric field inside
a Si gap and into the metals for gap widths of w =
100 nm (Figure 4) and w = 200 nm (Figure 5) for different MSM materials: Au–Si–TiN (TNI
2018),18,19 Au–Si–Ti, Au–Si–TiN
(TNI 2014),18,19 and Au–Si–Au, respectively.
The corresponding electric field profile as a function of position,
for all the metal combinations, is shown in (i) and (j).
This allows for observation of the influence of both material properties
and gap width on the electric field’s distribution inside the
gap, as well as the absorption at the MS interfaces. Figures 6 and 7 show results for the same metal combination but for a wider gap
of 500 nm.

As mentioned in the “Photodetector design”
section,
the amount of the energy in the metal and dielectric depends on the
material’s optical properties and the waveguide geometry. A
large negative real permittivity of a metal gives small penetration
into the metal, whereas a small imaginary permittivity leads to lower
losses, hence absorption. The penetration depth into the metal is
defined mostly by the longitudinal component of the electric field.
For waveguide-integrated PDs, the smaller penetration depth into the
metal indicates that more hot carriers can participate in the transition
to the semiconductor, enhancing the photocurrent. As the penetration
depth in the metal increases, the transition probability decreases.
Hot electrons generated far from the MS interface can lose their energy
through scattering, which reduces the transition probability to the
semiconductor. Thus, for photodetection, the main objective is to
achieve high absorption as close as possible to the MS interface.

For the Au–Si–Au structure, the electric field distribution
both in the gap and in the metal is symmetric, which limits its application
in a PD. Furthermore, absorption in the metal is very small; thus,
a significant amount of hot carriers is not generated. In comparison,
the absorption in the metal is highly enhanced when Ti–Si or
TiN–Si interfaces are used in Au–Si–Ti or Au–Si–TiN
structures, respectively.

The magnitude of the electric field
into a MS interface for a gap width of g = 100 nm
and for the Ti–Si interface reaches 19.3 (a.u.), while for
the TiN–Si interface, it exceeds 15.1 (a.u.) and 13.6 (a.u.).
Simultaneously, the absorption depth for Ti is much longer, and even
after 50 nm, the magnitude of the electric field into a metal reaches
6.3 (a.u.), while for TiN, this value is achieved only after 25 nm.

As mentioned earlier, hot carriers generated far from the MS interface
have a low probability of participating in a transition to a semiconductor.
Taking into account an electron mean free path into Ti and TiN that
is in the range of 50 nm,24 we expect a
low probability of transition for the hot carriers generated above
this distance. It is worth noticing that the imaginary part of the
mode effective index for the Au–Si–Ti structure (nim = 0.630·i) is more
than 2.5 times higher than the imaginary part of the Au–Si–TiN
structure (nim = 0.264·i and nim = 0.255·i) (Figure 4). Thus,
making the Au–Si–TiN PD 2 times longer, we can achieve
even better absorption into the metal, and simultaneously, more hot
carriers will be generated close to the TiN–Si interface that
can participate in a photocurrent generation. As reported in refs,28,29 the bandwidth
of the MSM PDs is limited by the carrier transit time rather than
by the RC time constant. Thus, making a PD even 2.5 times longer will
not influence its bandwidth.

Even more pronounced behavior is
observed for the wider gap of g = 200 nm (Figure 5). The magnitude
of the electric field at the Ti–Si interface for the Au–Si–Ti
structure reaches 12.8 (a.u.) and drops to 4.3 (a.u.) after 50 nm
inside Ti. In comparison, the magnitude of the electric field at the
TiN–Si interface reaches 11.4 (a.u.) and drops to 2 (a.u.)
after the same distance of 50 nm inside TiN. Furthermore, the imaginary
part of the mode effective index for the Au–Si–Ti (nim = 0.368·i) structure
is over twice as higher as the Au–Si–TiN structures
(nim = 0.171·i and nim = 0.176·i); as a result,
a 2 times longer Au–Si–TiN PD can provide the same absorption
losses. At the same time, it can ensure much more hot carrier generation
in a shorter distance from the MS interface.

When the gap between
metals is further increased to g = 500 nm, the absorption
losses for the symmetric Au–Si–Au structure decrease
as a result of lower electric field penetration into Au (Figure 6a). However, for
the asymmetric structures (Figures 6b and 7a,b), it can be observed
that two separate modes propagate on each side of the MS interface.
For the Au–Si–Ti structure, the real part of the mode
effective index for the mode associated with the Au–Si interface
is significantly higher than the Ti–Si mode effective index,
while the absorption is around 20 times smaller (neff = 3.45 – 0.033·i for
Au–Si and neff = 3.27 –
0.656·i for Ti–Si). On the contrary,
for the Au–Si–TiN structure, the real part of the mode
effective index for both modes associated with the Au–Si and
TiN–Si interfaces is very close to each other, with the absorption
of mode associated with the TiN–Si interface being 4–5
times higher compared to the mode bounded to the Au–Si interface.
Simultaneously, the electric field decays much faster at the TiN–Si
interface compared to that at the Ti–Si interface, thus many
more hot electrons can participate in a transition to Si.

For
the TiN–Si interface, 90% of the power is absorbed within a
33 nm-thick TiN area attached to Si. Compared to it, for the Ti–Si
interface, this area increases to 50 nm.24 Taking into account the electron mean free path in TiN and Ti being
evaluated at 50 nm, the hot electron generated in TiN has higher probability
to participate in transition to Si without interface scattering compared
to Ti. As a result, the internal quantum efficiency increase calculated
at 35% can be achieved. Furthermore, compared to Au, Cu, Al, and Ag,
TiN provides a lower Fermi energy (EF =
4.2 eV) and a longer electron mean free path (50 nm). While the former
increases the cone of allowed wavevectors of hot electrons that can
be injected into the semiconductor, the latter ensures an increase
in the number of hot electrons reaching the MS interface. As a result,
assuming the Schottky barrier height of ΦB = 0.35
eV and Si (ms = 0.3·m0), the probability of IPE of hot electrons generated
by a photon with energy h̵ω = 0.8 eV
(λ = 1550 nm) was calculated at 2.4% for Au–Si and 3.2%
for TiN–Si. It is over 1.33 times higher for TiN even without
taking into account the electron mean free path.

Apart from
the responsivity and bandwidth, another important figure of merit
of the PD is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)27 defined as SNR = is2/in2, where is and in are the signal and noise
currents, respectively. It is highly desired to enhance the signal
while keeping the noise at the low level. One solution to achieve
a high SNR is by reducing the dimensions of the active Schottky junction
area. Another solution is through optimizing the Schottky barrier
between the metal and semiconductor that should be as close as possible
to the ideal value of ∼0.697 eV for telecom applications at
1550 nm (∼0.8 eV) that is calculated from ΦBopt = hν – 4kT/e.27 Thus, the Schottky barrier
height of ΦB = 0.67 eV between TiN and p-doped Si
based on our measurements is very close to the optimal value of ΦBopt = 0.697 eV for an ideal diode.27 The Schottky barrier height of ΦB = 0.67 eV for
the p-Si–TiN contact is much closer to the ideal value when
compared to p-Si–Ti or p-Si–Au contacts that were measured
at 0.61 and 0.32 eV, respectively.27

Conclusions
We propose titanium
nitride as an alternative material for application in compact waveguide-integrated
PDs. In addition to its CMOS compatibility with standard fabrication
technology, TiN offers superior electrical properties in terms of
the Schottky barrier height, calculated at 0.67 eV for a junction
formed between TiN and p-doped Si and 0.35 eV for a junction between
TiN and n-doped Si. The value of 0.67 eV is very close to the optimal
Schottky barrier height of 0.697 eV for an operating wavelength of
1550 nm (∼0.8 eV) that enables very high SNR. Simultaneously,
titanium nitride offers superior optical properties for photodetection—reasonably
high negative real part of permittivity and reasonably high imaginary
part, enabling a high absorption and reduced penetration depth when
compared to Ti. All these properties make titanium nitride a favorable
material for the fabrication of on-chip PDs.
