To
assess the plausibility of prebiotic nucleic acid polymerization
by a sequential phosphitylation–sulfurization mechanism, the
rates of hydrolysis and sulfurization of bis(2′,3′-O-methyleneadenosin-5′-yl)-H-phosphonate, a dinucleoside
H-phosphonate diester, have been determined over a wide pH range (0.52–7.25)
and in the presence of varying amounts (0–30 mg) of elemental
sulfur. The pH-rate profile of hydrolysis resembled the one previously
reported for the H-phosphonate analogue of thymidylyl-3′,5′-thymidine,
with a relatively wide pH-independent region flanked by acid- and
base-catalyzed regions. Sulfurization to the respective phosphorothioate
diester, in turn, was found to be base-catalyzed over the entire pH
range studied. Despite the facile hydrolysis of H-phosphonate diesters
and the extremely low solubility of elemental sulfur in water, sulfurization
and hydrolysis proceeded at comparable rates under neutral and mildly
acidic conditions.

Introduction
The emergence of an
information-carrying polymer, possibly RNA,
was a defining moment in the origin of life.1−6 The key step in the prebiotic polymerization of RNA, that is, nonenzymatic
esterification of phosphoric acid, is hindered by significant kinetic
and thermodynamic barriers, as well as the low solubility of phosphate
minerals in water.7−9 With the notable exception of a recent report on
in situ-activated polymerization of nucleoside 5′-monophosphates,10 the enzyme-free nucleic acid polymerizations
described in the literature have employed preactivated monomers.11−14

The relatively facile reactions of trivalent phosphorus15 and high solubility of phosphite minerals16 make the involvement of phosphorous acid, rather
than phosphoric acid, in prebiotic phosphorus chemistry an intriguing
alternative.9,17−20 Trivalent phosphorus could have
originated from either terrestrial21 or
extraterrestrial22−25 sources, and in the Archean ocean, phosphite may have been more
abundant than phosphate.26 Even in contemporary
oceans, between 10 and 20% of the dissolved phosphorus bears an oxidation
state lower than +5.27

In contrast
to phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid undergoes rapid
esterification under anhydrous conditions.28,29 The resulting H-phosphonate monoesters are stable in aqueous media,
whereas the respective diesters are rapidly hydrolyzed.30 In the presence of a suitable oxidant, however,
H-phosphonates are readily converted to the much more stable pentavalent
counterparts, such as phosphates or phosphorothioates. Interestingly,
this reaction is faster for diesters than for monoesters31 or inorganic phosphite32,33 and could, hence, drive polymerization. Oxidative coupling of H-phosphonate
monoesters with alcohols has already been demonstrated in anhydrous
media using elemental bromine34 or sulfur29 as the primary oxidant. Owing to the reversibility
of the hydrolysis and esterification reactions of phosphorous acid
derivatives, such a pathway could in principle work even in aqueous
solution (Scheme 1).
The plausibility of this hypothesis depends on the relative rates
of the various hydrolysis, esterification, and oxidation steps.

Scheme 1 Oxidation, Esterification, and Hydrolysis Pathways for Phosphorous
Acid and Its Mono- and Diesters
In the present study, the rates of hydrolysis and sulfurization
of bis(2′,3′-O-methyleneadenosin-5′-yl)-H-phosphonate
(1h) were measured over a wide pH range and in the presence
of various amounts of elemental sulfur. The symmetric H-phosphonate
diester 1h was chosen as a model compound because of
the relative simplicity of the expected product mixture. Fission of
either of the P–O bonds yields the same alcohol and H-phosphonate
monoester and sulfurization at the phosphorus atom does not give rise
to a new chiral center. Finally, the methylene bridge between the
2′- and 3′-oxygens prevents H-phosphonate migration.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation of the H-Phosphonate Diester
and Monoester Model
Compounds
The model H-phosphonate diester 1h was synthesized from 2′,3′-O-methyleneadenosine
(2) following a procedure previously reported for various
primary and secondary alcohols.35 Accordingly,
the phenoxo ligands of diphenyl phosphite were displaced by 2′,3′-O-methyleneadenosine (2)36 in anhydrous pyridine (Scheme 2). The desired product 1h precipitated
out of the reaction mixture and could be isolated by simple filtration.
The respective monoester 3h was obtained through a similar
process except that an excess of diphenyl phosphite was used, and
the transesterification step was followed by hydrolytic cleavage of
any remaining phenoxo ligands (Scheme 2). The same procedure has previously been used for
the preparation of various nucleoside-5′-H-phosphonates.37

H-Phosphonate Diester Hydrolysis and Sulfurization
The reactions of the H-phosphonate diester 1h were
first
studied in the presence of 0–30 mg of sublimed elemental sulfur
to find out whether sulfurization can compete with hydrolysis in aqueous
solution. The reaction mixtures were thermostated to 60.0 ± 0.1
°C, and their pH was adjusted to 4.56 with a 100 mM acetic acid
buffer and ionic strength to 1.0 M with sodium chloride. The volume
of the reaction mixtures was 272 μL, and the starting concentration
of 1h was 10.0 μM. In other words, the amount of
sulfur vastly exceeded the amount of 1h in most of the
experiments. However, owing to the extremely low solubility of sulfur
in water,38 the situation was reversed
in the solution phase. To obtain a reproducible dispersion of the
insoluble sulfur, the reaction mixtures were sonicated before starting
the kinetic runs. Samples were withdrawn from the reaction mixtures
at appropriate time intervals, and their compositions were determined
by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC).
Only the expected reactions, viz., hydrolysis of 1h to
2′,3′-O-methyleneadenosine (2) and its 5′-H-phosphonate (3h) (Scheme 3, k1) and sulfurization of 1h to the corresponding phosphorothioate
(1s) (Scheme 3, k2) were observed during a typical
kinetic run. A representative time–concentration profile is
depicted in Figure 1. Pseudo-first-order rate constants for the overall disappearance
of 1h were obtained by applying the first-order rate
law to the time-dependent concentration of 1h. The rate
constants thus obtained were then broken down to contributions of
hydrolysis and sulfurization based on the relative concentrations
of 3h and 1s, respectively.

of 1h (□), its
hydrolysis products 3h (●) and 2 (○),
and the sulfurization product 1s (■) in the presence
of 3 mg of sublimed elemental sulfur; T = 60.0 °C,
pH = 4.56 (200 mM acetate buffer), and I(NaCl) =
1.0 M.

Scheme 3 Reaction Pathways for the Hydrolysis
and Sulfurization of the H-Phosphonate
Diester 1h
The observed pseudo-first-order rate constants for the
hydrolysis
and sulfurization of 1h as a function of the amount of
sulfur in the reaction mixtures are presented in Figure 2. As expected, the hydrolysis
rate was essentially independent on m(S8). The sulfurization rate, in turn, exhibited a clear dependence
on m(S8) in the presence of small amounts
of sulfur, with leveling-off in the presence of larger amounts. The
sulfurization rate exceeded the hydrolysis rate when approximately
15 mg of S8 was added to the reaction mixture.

Figure 2 Observed rate
constants for the hydrolysis (●) and sulfurization
(○) of 1h as a function of the amount of elemental
sulfur; T = 60 °C, pH = 4.56 (100 mM acetate
buffer), and I(NaCl) = 1.0 M.

Given the very low (and constant) concentration of elemental
sulfur
in the solution phase, it appears likely that sulfurization of 1h takes place at the interface between the solution and the
insoluble sulfur particles. This interpretation is further borne out
by the observation that the rate of sulfurization was dependent on
the particle size of the sulfur used: a single flake of sulfur was
approximately an order of magnitude less efficient as a sulfurizing
agent than an equal amount of sublimed sulfur (data not shown). Although
some of the reaction components, notably the hydrolysis product 3h, are amphiphilic and could, in principle, solubilize sulfur,
such a process is not likely to play a major role at the low concentration
of the potential surfactants.39 The saturation
of the sulfurization rate observed at larger amounts of sulfur could
stem from aggregation of the particles and the scattering of the data
from difficulties in maintaining a uniform particle size distribution
throughout the kinetic runs.

Rate constants for the hydrolysis
and sulfurization of 1h were also determined over a wide
pH range (0.52–7.25) in
the presence of a fixed amount (3.0 mg) of sublimed sulfur (Figure 3). The pH of the
reaction solutions was adjusted with hydrogen chloride and formic,
acetic, and cacodylic acid buffers. Hydrolysis was subject to a very
modest buffer catalysis in formic and acetic acid buffers. For the
pH-rate profile, rate constants at zero buffer concentration were
obtained by linear extrapolation from rate constants measured in 20,
50, 100, and 200 mM buffers. No buffer catalysis was observed with
hydrolysis in cacodylate buffer or with sulfurization under any of
the conditions used. In these cases, the rate constants presented
in Figure 2 are averages
of at least three measurements carried out at different buffer concentrations.
All of the observed rate constants are summarized in the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 pH-rate profiles for
the hydrolysis (●) and sulfurization
(○) of 1h in the presence of 3.0 mg of sublimed
elemental sulfur; T = 60 °C and I(NaCl) = 1.0 M.

The pH-rate profile for
hydrolysis closely resembles the one previously
reported for the H-phosphonate analogue of thymidylyl-3′,5′-thymidine.30 Accordingly, hydrolysis of 1h was
first order in hydronium ion under strongly acidic conditions and
first order in hydroxide ion under neutral and mildly acidic conditions.
The intervening pH-independent region, however, was considerably wider
than with thymidylyl-3′,5′-thymidine. The observed rate
constant may be expressed by eq 1 1  where k1H and k1OH are the second-order
rate constants for the hydronium- and hydroxide-ion-catalyzed hydrolysis,
respectively, k1W is the first-order rate constant for the pH-independent
hydrolysis, and KW is the ion product
of water under the experimental conditions (1.58 × 10–13 M2). The values obtained for k1H, k1W, and k1OH by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the experimental data to eq 1 were (1.4 ± 0.2)
× 10–2 M–1 s–1, (1.3 ± 0.1) × 10–4 s–1, and (7.1 ± 0.7) × 103 M–1 s–1, respectively.

As previously demonstrated
for the hydrolysis of simple H-phosphonate
diesters,40,41 all of the partial reactions in all likelihood
proceed by a nucleophilic attack on phosphorus (rather than carbon).
Accordingly, the most probable explanation for the observed hydronium
ion catalysis is facilitation of the nucleophilic attack of a water
molecule by preequilibrium protonation of the H-phosphonate. The pH-independence,
in turn, is open to two kinetically equivalent interpretations, viz.,
the attack of a water molecule on neutral H-phosphonate or the attack
of a hydroxide ion on a protonated monocationic H-phosphonate. Hydroxide
ion catalysis becomes the predominant pathway already at pH 5, suggesting
that hydroxide ion is a better nucleophile than water by at least
7 orders of magnitude (pKW under the experimental
conditions = 12.8). Similarly, protonation of the H-phosphonate diester
makes it more electrophilic, but the magnitude of this activation
cannot be estimated as acidity constants of monoprotonated H-phosphonate
diesters are not known. Finally, the hydroxide ion catalysis is undoubtedly
attributable to the attack of a hydroxide ion on a neutral H-phosphonate.

Sulfurization of 1h was base-catalyzed over the entire
pH range studied, but the dependence on hydroxide ion concentration
appears to be less than first order. The observed rate constant may
be expressed by eq 2 2  where k2OH is the rate constant for the
hydroxide-ion-catalyzed sulfurization, KW is the ion product of water, and n is the reaction
order with respect to hydroxide ion. The values obtained for k2OH and n by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the
experimental data to eq 2 were 1.9 ± 0.8 M–n s–1 and 0.53 ± 0.02, respectively.

Bases play
a dual role in the sulfurization of H-phosphonate diesters.42 First, a sufficiently strong base is required
to abstract the P–H proton, thereby converting the H-phosphonate
into a more reactive phosphite anion.43 Second, bases can activate sulfur by breaking its eight-membered
ring structure.44,45 The fractional order dependence
on hydroxide ion concentration probably stems from this dual role
as well as the heterogeneity of the sulfurization reaction. It can
be speculated that the reaction order n is exactly
1/2, but the data at hand do not allow a firm conclusion to be drawn.

Conclusions
Sulfurization of H-phosphonate diesters by elemental
sulfur is
able to compete with hydrolysis despite the extremely low solubility
of elemental sulfur in water. The reaction is base-catalyzed over
a wide pH range, with the relative rate of sulfurization to hydrolysis
reaching a maximum around pH 5. In other words, once formed, H-phosphonate
diester linkages could be stabilized by sulfurization to the respective
phosphorothioate diester linkages even in aqueous solutions. One could,
for example, envision cycles of de- and rehydration driving nucleic
acid polymerization in a volcanic environment enriched in phosphite
and sulfur.

Experimental Section
General Methods
NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker
Avance 500 NMR spectrometer, and the chemical shifts are given in
ppm. Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF-Q ESI mass spectrometer.
Synthesis of 2′,3′-O-methyleneadenosine
(2) has been described in the literature.36 The other chemicals were commercial products
and were used as received.

Kinetic Measurements
The reactions
were carried out
in sealed tubes in a dry bath thermostated to 60.0 ± 0.1 °C.
The pH of the reaction solutions was adjusted with hydrogen chloride
and formic, acetic, and cacodylic acid buffers and the ionic strength
(1.0 M) with sodium chloride. Sublimed elemental sulfur was added
to the reaction mixtures and dispersed by sonication before the start
of each kinetic run. The initial concentration of the starting material 1h in the kinetic runs was 10.0 μM. The composition
of aliquots drawn from the reaction mixtures at appropriate time intervals
was determined by RP-HPLC on a Hypersil-Keystone Aquasil C18 column
(150 × 4 mm and 5 μm), eluting with a linear gradient (8–55%
over 15 min) of acetonitrile in a 60 mM acetic acid buffer (pH = 4.3).
The flow rate was 1.0 mL min–1, and the detection
wavelength was 260 nm. The observed retention times were as follows:
4.6 min (3h), 7.4 min (2), 7.7 min (1s), and 9.9 min (1h). The identity of these
components was verified by HPLC-mass spectometry (MS) (with 1s) or spiking with authentic samples (with 1h, 2, and 3h). Molar absorptivities of the
dimeric components (1h and 1s) were assumed
to be twice as high as those of the monomeric components (2 and 3h).

(1h)
2′,3′-O-Methyleneadenosine
(2, 0.290 g, and 1.04 mmol) was coevaporated from anhydrous
pyridine, and the residue was redissolved in anhydrous pyridine (10
mL). Diphenyl phosphite (95.0 μL and 0.361 mmol) was added,
and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h,
during which a solid precipitated. This material was isolated by filtration
and found to be the desired product 1h in sufficient
purity for the kinetic experiments. The low yield (18.8 mg and 6%)
thus obtained suggests that most of the products remained in the pyridine
solution, but no attempts were made to recover it. 1H NMR

purified on a silica gel column, eluting with a mixture of Et3N, MeOH, and CH2Cl2 (1:19:80, v/v).
