Feed coal, fly ash
(FA), and bottom ash (BA) were collected from
a 300 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. A mechanical screen classifier
was used to separate and obtain particles with different sizes. The
distribution of valuable elements, including aluminum (Al), lithium
(Li), and gallium (Ga), and rare earth elements (REE) in the samples
was investigated. Results indicate that the contents of SiO2 and Al2O3 in sized ash particles decreased
as the particle size decreased; meanwhile, the contents of CaO, SO3, and Fe2O3 apparently increased. The
sulfur-fixing product anhydrite tended to be distributed in the fine
ash particles. The valuable elements were more enriched in FA than
in BA. The Li, Ga, and REE were evenly distributed in FA particles
with different sizes. Separating ash particles with a superhigh concentration
of these rare elements was difficult using the mechanical screen,
but a part of the anhydrite or CaO in circulating fluidized bed ash
could be removed easily. The Li and REE in the feed coal were highly
associated with quartz, kaolinite, and other fractions containing
SiO2 and Al2O3. No definitive relationship
between the Ga concentration and Al2O3 content
in the feed coal and ash samples was observed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Coal is the primary fossil
energy resource in China, and the yield
of coal production in the country reached 3.41 Gt in 2016.1 Coal gangue and coal sludge produced from coal
mining and washing processes are regarded as industrial solid wastes,
and their average production is approximately 15–25% of the
raw coal production in China.2,3 Circulating fluidized
bed (CFB) combustion technology has great fuel flexibility, and CFB
boilers can burn the worst grade of available fuels.4 Electric power generation via coal gangue combustion in
a CFB boiler is a potential method for heavily consuming these wastes.
In recent years, the amount of CFB boilers has been increasing in
China, especially in the Shanxi Province. Combustion in these CFB
boilers generates large amounts of fly ash (FA) and bottom ash (BA)
solid wastes, which are presently underutilized. With low economic
benefits, CFB FA and BA have been mainly used in the building material
industry as fillers in brick manufacturing and additives in cement
and concrete.5 Large amounts of CFB ash
could not be consumed and are still dumped into ponds or piled on
land. The irregular accumulation and inappropriate disposal of ashes
endanger human health and the environment.

Many coalfields with
high content of valuable elements, such as
aluminum (Al), lithium (Li), gallium (Ga), and rare earth elements
(REE) have been discovered in Northwest China, especially in Inner
Mongolia and Shanxi Province.6,7 Compared with common
Chinese and worldwide coals, the coals from Jungar, Inner Mongolia
are more highly enriched with Al, Li, Ga, and REE.8,9 Sun
et al.10 found that the Li, Ga, and Al
contents of the coals from the Pingshuo Mining District, Ningwu Coalfield,
Shanxi Province in China have reached an economically valuable level.
In addition, the contents of these valuable elements in coal gangue
from these districts are evidently higher than those in coal because
these valuable elements are mainly found in the inorganic matter of
coals.11 Most of these inorganic valuable
elements in coal gangue or coal are moved to FA and BA during combustion
in the CFB boilers.12,13 The recycling of these valuable
metals from coal ash not only conserves natural resources and reduces
environmental impacts but also utilizes ash with high economic benefit.14 Generally, the selection of recovery technology
and recovery cost is considerably influenced by the concentration
of valuable elements in coal ash. Understanding the distribution of
valuable elements in FA and BA is essential for the improvement of
recovery technology. Furthermore, coal ash is a complex mixture and
is assumed to be composed of various particles. The particle size
and distribution of elements are uneven due to the different formation
conditions of coal ash. Ke et al.15 corroborated
that the larger CFB ash particles were composed of some hard materials
such as quartz, mullite, and glass particles with different sizes
have different chemical composition and mineral matter. Li et al.16 investigated the distribution characteristics
of heavy metals in different sizes of FA from a sewage sludge circulating
fluidized bed incinerator and corroborated that the heavy metal contents
of small-sized FA were higher than those of large-sized FA. Raclavská
et al.17 studied the enrichment and distribution
of 24 elements within the subsieve particle size distribution ranges
of FA from waste incinerator plants and affirmed that a great enrichment
of the majority of elements was observed for a particle size range
of <100 μm and was attributed to the vaporization and condensation
mechanisms. López-Antón et al.18 investigated the behavior of thallium in a 50 MW industrial circulating
fluidized bed combustion plant and the distribution of thallium among
BA and FA. They contended that thallium is relatively homogeneously
distributed in all of the ash samples regardless of their composition
but is slightly related to surface area, which in turn is dependent
on particle size and unburned carbon content. Most studies on element
distribution in coal ash are focused on deleterious elements.19−22 However, the distribution characteristics of valuable elements,
including Al, Li, Ga, and REE, in different sizes of FA and BA from
industrial CFB boilers are unclear to date. In addition, extracting
the rare elements from coal ash is difficult due to the relatively
low concentration of rare elements in coal ash. The difficulty in
extraction will be reduced, and the economics of valuable element
extraction will be enhanced if certain size fractions are more enriched
in these valuable elements. Furthermore, whether the simplest mechanical
screening can be used to increase the concentration of rare elements
in coal ash with specific particle size is still unclear.

In
this work, the mineral matter, chemical composition, and rare
element (Li, Ga, and REE) content in feed coal, FA, and BA from a
300 MW circulating fluidized bed in a coal gangue power plant are
investigated. A mechanical screen classifier is used to separate particles
in different sizes of FA and BA. The distribution characteristics
of mineral matter, oxides, and rare elements in the sized particles
are investigated systematically. This study mainly aims to clarify
the distribution and enrichment of valuable elements in the differently
sized feed coal, FA, and BA from the industrial CFB boiler.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characteristics of Feed
Coal
2.1.1 Particle Size Distribution
Figure 1 depicts the particle
size distribution of feed coal. The percentage of 5–40 mesh
coal particles is the highest (reaches up to 67%), and the percentage
of other particle sizes is less than 10%. Compared with the particle
size of feed coal in a pulverized coal furnace, the size of feed coal
in the CFB furnace is relatively bigger (0.4–3 mm).

Figure 1 Particle size
distribution of feed coal.

2.1.2 Proximate Analysis
Table 1 exhibits the proximate analysis
of sized feed coal samples. The ash contents of coal particles with
different sizes vary. As the particle size decreases, the ash content
in coal particles gradually decreases, indicating that more inorganic
matter exists in coarse coal particles. In contrast, the content of
fixed carbon in coal particles increases with the decrease in particle
size.

2.1.3 Mineral Matter
Figure 2 illustrates the mineral matter
and their contents in coal samples with different particle sizes.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of coal particles with sizes
of 5–40, 40–80, 80–120, and 160–200 mesh
are not given because they are similar to the patterns illustrated
in Figure 2. The major
minerals in feed coal are kaolinite (2SiO2·Al2O3·2H2O) and quartz (SiO2). The feed coal also contains a small amount of boehmite (AlOOH)
and gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O). The mineral matter
content in coal varies with the size of coal particle. The content
of kaolinite in coal particles bigger than 80 mesh decreases slightly
as the particle size decreases and then decreases dramatically when
the coal particle size is smaller than 120 mesh. The content of quartz
in coal particles decreases with the decrease in particle size. The
boehmite is mainly distributed in the coarse coal particles (>160
mesh), whereas the gypsum is mainly distributed in the fine coal particles
(<80 mesh). In addition to crystalline minerals, coal also contains
noncrystallized inorganic matter, which is usually referred to as
amorphous matter.23 The main chemical composition
of amorphous matter in coal should be SiO2 and Al2O3 based on the chemical composition of inorganic matter
and mineral content in coal. The content of amorphous matter in coal
particles increases gradually with the decrease in particle size.

Figure 2 Mineral
matter (a) and their contents (b) in feed coal particles
with different sizes.

2.1.4 Chemical Composition
Table 2 presents the major chemical
composition and rare element content in raw feed coal and sized coal
particles. The distribution of mineral matter in coal particles with
different sizes causes the chemical composition variation of coal
particles. Overall, the contents of SiO2 and Al2O3 decrease gradually as the coal particle size decreases,
whereas the contents of Fe2O3, CaO, and SO3 show an increasing trend with the decrease in coal particle
size. The decrease of kaolinite and quartz with a decrease in feed
coal particle size results in the decrease in SiO2 and
Al2O3 contents in the fine coal particles. The
variation of CaO and SO3 content in the coal particles
with different sizes is caused by the distribution of gypsum in feed
coal particles. The concentration variation trend of Li and REE with
coal particle size is consistent with that of SiO2 and
Al2O3. Unlike Li and REE, Ga is evenly distributed
in coal particles.

Figure 3 shows the
concentration of Li and REE as a function of the contents of quartz
and kaolinite. The Li and REE concentrations in feed coal particles
are highly correlated with the content of quartz. A clear relationship
is found between the concentration of Li/REE and the content of kaolinite,
although r2 is lower than that of quartz. Figure 4 shows that the Li
and REE concentrations in feed coal particles are highly correlated
with the contents of SiO2 and Al2O3 and their sum. These results confirm that the occurrence of Li and
REE in coals is related to minerals and amorphous fractions. Karayigit
et al.24 found that Li is closely related
to the aluminosilicates in coal. Lewińska-Preis et al.25 proved that Li in the Kaffioyra coal was bound
to minerals and that 72% of Li was associated with organic matter
in Longyearbyen coal. Sun et al.26 claimed
that the content of Li was much higher in inorganic matter than that
in organic matter. This result implies that the occurrence of Li in
coal deeply depends on the type, origin, and characteristics of coal.
Coal gangue containing abundant kaolinite accounts for approximately
60% of the feed coal. Hence, the Li and REE in the feed coal are associated
with quartz, kaolinite, and other fractions containing SiO2 and Al2O3.

of (a) Li and (b) REE and
contents of quartz and kaolinite.

Figure 4 Relationship between the concentration of (a) Li and (b) REE and
contents of SiO2, Al2O3, and their
sum.

Gallium is generally related to
clay minerals, boehmite or other
aluminum-containing fractions, and probably as substitute for Al in
the framework structure of minerals.8 In
addition, Ga may occur in organic matter in some coals.27 However, no definitive relationship between
the concentration of Ga and the contents of kaolinite, boehmite, organic
matter, and Al2O3 in the feed coal is observed
in this work.

The loss of ignition (LOI) of BA is higher than that of FA due
to the high content of unburned carbon or unreacted limestone in BA.
The content of SiO2 in FA is lower than that in BA, whereas
the contents of Al2O3, Fe2O3, and MgO in FA are higher than those in BA. These results indicate
that the inorganic matter rich in SiO2 tends to be distributed
in coarse BA particles and that the inorganic matter rich in Al2O3 is more likely to enter the fine FA particles. Table 2 affirms that the
contents of CaO and SO3 are enriched in the fine particles.
However, the contents of CaO and SO3 in FA are similar
to those in BA caused by the addition of limestone (CaCO3), which is used for catching sulfur oxide in the flue gas in this
plant. The particle size range of limestone is 0.08–2.5 mm,
and the content of the 0.63–2.5 mm particle is the highest
in the feed limestone.28 Compared with
the FA, the feed limestone is coarser. Therefore, the sulfur-fixing
product anhydrite (CaSO4) and unreacted limestone/lime
enter the BA easily.29 The particle size
of limestone can decrease dramatically due to the decomposition of
limestone at high temperatures. A part of fine limestone and its derivative
particles enter the FA, leading to similar contents of CaO and SO3 in the FA and BA.

Table 3 shows that
the concentration of rare elements in the FA particle is higher than
that in the BA particle, indicating that the Li, Ga, and REE are more
abundant in fine FA particles during coal combustion. Elements, such
as Al, Li, Ga, and REE, in ash are widely considered to be valuable
elements, which can be extracted for recycling. They can also be concentrated
from coal to FA during coal combustion. The content of alumina in
FA is approximately 15% higher than that in coal. Compared to those
in coal, the concentrations of Li, Ga, and REE in FA increase by approximately
57, 51, and 80%, respectively.

2.3 Composition
of Ash Particles with Different
Sizes
2.3.1 Particle Size Distribution
Figure 5 shows the particle
size distribution of the ash samples. The weights of particles with
the sizes of >160 mesh and <300 mesh are extremely low. The
particle
size distribution of FA is narrow, ranging from 160 to 300 mesh. Particles
in the range of 200–240 mesh account for approximately half
of the FA particles. Unique working conditions, including coarse feed
coal and the relatively low combustion temperature, cause the FA collected
from the CFB boiler to be distinctly coarser than the FA collected
from the pulverized coal plant.30

Figure 5 Particle size
distribution of (a) FA and (b) BA.

In contrast, the particle size distribution of BA is wide,
ranging
from 5 to 200 mesh, and the particles with sizes between 5 and 40
mesh hold the largest proportion of BA.

2.3.2 Composition
of FA Particles with Different
Sizes
The main chemical composition and mineral content in
FA particles with different sizes are determined by X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) and XRD, respectively. The results of the FA1–FA4 samples
are similar. Therefore, only the results of FA1 are illustrated in Figure 6 to avoid redundancy.
The contents of SiO2 and Al2O3 in
FA decrease slightly as the particle size decreases; meanwhile, the
contents of CaO, SO3, and Fe2O3 increase.
The mineral matter in FA comprises quartz, anhydrite, and hematite
(Fe2O3). The amount of crystalline minerals
accounts for ∼20% of FA quality and the other is the amorphous
component. The kaolinite in feed coal decomposes above 600 °C
and transforms into amorphous matter including metakaolin and amorphous
Al and Si oxides, which would transform to mullite or other crystalline
aluminosilicates above 1000 °C.31,32 However, the
operation temperature of CFB boilers is 800–900 °C. The
amorphous metakaolin, Al, and Si oxides cannot transform to crystalline
mineral and still exist in the ash. Similar to the content variation
of quartz in feed coal particles, the quartz content decreases with
the decrease in FA particle size. Limestone (CaCO3) powder
is used for capturing sulfur oxide in the flue gas in this plant,
and it transforms into anhydrite during coal combustion. The content
of anhydrite in fine FA particles is higher than that in coarse FA
particles. Iron oxide in FA mainly exists in the form of hematite
according to their similar contents in FA.

Figure 6 Content variation of
(a) main components and (b) minerals in FA1
with particle size.

Figure 7 depicts
the content variation of Li, Ga, and REE in FA with particle size.
Results demonstrate that the distribution of Li, Ga, and REE in FA
particles with 200–260 mesh is basically homogeneous. Previous
studies20,33 have noted that the heavy metals or some
trace elements were more abundant in the small-sized FA particles.
However, no definitive trend in variation of Li, Ga, and REE was observed
between the FA particles with different sizes. Generally, the volatile
elements tend to be enriched in fine FA particles. These indicate
that the Li, Ga, and REE in the coal are nonvolatile or weak-volatile
elements under CFB conditions.

Figure 7 Content variation of (a) Li, (b) Ga, and
(c) REE in FA with particle
size.

Figures 3 and 4 show that the
Li and REE in the feed coal are associated
with quartz, kaolinite, and other fractions containing SiO2 and Al2O3. However, the relationship is not
observed in the FA particles. The inorganic matter, including minerals
in feed coal, underwent a series of complex changes during the combustion
process. The chemical structure of inorganic matter and the environment
of rare elements have changed, which may lead to the scattered distribution
of these rare elements in FA.

Figure 8 illustrates
the content variation of the main chemical components and mineral
matter in BA1 particles with different sizes. Similar to the element
distribution in the FA particles, the contents of SiO2 and
Al2O3 in BA decrease as the particle size decreases;
meanwhile, the contents of CaO and SO3 increase. The mineral
matter in BA comprises quartz, anhydrite, and lime (CaO). Limestone
decomposes to form lime at high temperatures. A small amount of lime
cannot react with sulfur oxide to form anhydrite and remains in the
BA. Hematite is not found in BA. Figure 8b shows that the quartz tends to be distributed
in coarse BA particles and anhydrite and lime tend to be distributed
in fine BA particles. Minerals containing Al2O3 are not detected in FA and BA. Hence, all of the Al2O3 exist in CFB coal ash in the form of amorphous matter. The
content of amorphous matter in the BA particles decreases with the
decrease in particle size.

Figure 8 Content variation of (a) main components and
(b) minerals in BA1
with particle size.

Figure 9 illustrates
the variation of Li, Ga, and REE concentrations in BA with particle
size. Overall, the concentration of Li in BA decreases with the decrease
in particle size. Figure 9b shows that Ga is evenly distributed in the BA particles
of 5–200 mesh size. Figure 9c demonstrates that the concentration of REE in the
40–80 mesh sized BA particles is slightly higher than that
in other sizes of BA particles. The concentration of REE in BA particles
decreases when the particle size is smaller than 160 mesh.

Figure 9 Variation of
(a) Li, (b) Ga, and (c) REE concentration in BA with
particle size.

Figure 10 indicates
that the Li concentration in BA is poorly correlated with the content
of SiO2 and quartz compared with the relationship in feed
coal. In contrast, the Li concentration in the BA is positively correlated
with the contents of Al2O3 and amorphous fractions.
However, no definitive relationship is observed between the concentration
of Ga/REE and the contents of minerals or other oxides in the BA.

3 Conclusions
Al is
mainly found in feed coal in kaolinite and boehmite. A small
amount of Al exists in the amorphous matter of feed coal. The average
contents of Li, Ga, and REE are concentrated at 121, 35, and 180 mg/kg
in the feed coal, respectively. The contents of Al, Li, and REE in
the feed coal decrease gradually with the decrease in coal particle
size. Ga is evenly distributed in sized coal particles.

These
valuable elements are more enriched in FA than in BA. The
average contents of Al2O3 and Li, Ga, and REE
are concentrated at 34.15% and 190, 53, and 324 mg/kg in FA, respectively.
The content of Al2O3 in FA is approximately
15% higher than that in coal. Compared to those in coal, the concentrations
of Li, Ga, and REE in FA increase by approximately 57, 51, and 80%,
respectively.

For the FA and BA, the contents of SiO2 and Al2O3 decrease as the particle size decreases;
meanwhile,
the contents of CaO, SO3, and Fe2O3 increase. The sulfur-fixing mineral anhydrite is enriched in the
fine particles, whereas Al2O3 is enriched in
the coarse particles. However, no significant variation is found in
the concentrations of Li, Ga, and REE in the FA particles with different
sizes. The concentration of Li in BA decreases with the decrease in
particle size.

These rare elements are not enriched in a certain
size particle
and are evenly distributed in the sized FA particles. Enrichment of
these rare elements in FA particles with a certain size using the
mechanical screen is difficult, but a part of anhydrite or CaO in
FA and BA can possibly be removed using this method.

The Li
and REE in the feed coal are highly associated with quartz,
kaolinite, and other fractions containing SiO2 and Al2O3. The Li concentration in the BA is positively
correlated with the contents of Al2O3 and amorphous
fractions. However, no definitive relationship between the Ga concentration
and contents of minerals containing Al2O3, organic
matter, and other fractions in the feed coal and ash samples is observed.
A thorough understanding of the physical and chemical nature of FA
and BA from an industrial CFB boiler is invaluable in the proper utilization
of this important resource. Data in this study can be helpful in the
development of an efficient utilization technology of CFB FA.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials and Preparation
Feed coal,
FA, and BA were collected in Pingshuo Coal Gangue Power Plant in the
north of Shanxi Province in China, which generates electricity using
mixtures of coal gangue and weathered coal as raw materials. Feed
coal (5 kg) was collected on the conveyer belt. To investigate the
distribution of valuable elements in coal with different particle
sizes, the feed coal was sieved using a stack of nested sieves with
the following meshes: 5, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 (about 3080, 385,
193, 128, 96, and 77 μm, respectively). The coal particles after
sieving were ground to less than 77 μm using a grinder for 20
min.

FA and BA were collected from the outlet of the precipitator
and slag separator, respectively. First, the FA was collected each
day at 5:00 am, 10:00 am, 17:00 pm, and 22:00 pm, respectively. These
ash samples were mixed evenly to guarantee representative ash samples.
The BA samples were collected using the same method. The FA and BA
samples were collected at the same time. The fly ash samples collected
in four days were denoted as FA1, FA2, FA3, and FA4, respectively.
The BA samples collected in four days were denoted as BA1, BA2, BA3,
and BA4, respectively.

The FA samples were sieved using a stack
of nested sieves with
the following meshes: 160, 200, 240, 260, and 300 (about 96, 77, 64,
59, and 51 μm, respectively). The BA samples were sieved using
a stack of nested sieves with the following meshes: 5, 40, 80, 120,
160, and 200 (about 3080, 385, 193, 128, 96, and 77 μm, respectively).
The sieving operation generally lasted 30–60 min depending
on the particle size and the amount of sample loaded. The weight of
particles with different sizes was recorded, and the mass fraction
of these particles was calculated.

4.2 Analytical
Methods
4.2.1 Proximate Analysis of Coal Sample
The proximate analysis of coal sample was conducted according to
the Chinese National Standards GT/T 212-2008.

4.2.2 Measurement of Chemical Composition
The main chemical
compositions of all samples were measured by X-ray
fluorescence (XRF, Bruker, S8 Tiger).

To analyze the chemical
composition of inorganic matters and mineral matter in coal samples
accurately, the organic matter in the coal was removed by oxygen plasma
oxidation in a K1050X plasma furnace (Quorum Technologies Ltd.). The
acquired ash sample was referred to as low-temperature ash (denoted
LTA).

The LTA, FA, and BA samples (0.1g) were digested using
a mixture
of 4 mL of aqua regia (VHCl/VHNO3 = 3:1) and 2 mL of n hydrofluoric
acid (HF) at 180 °C for 60 min in a microwave digestion system
(Anton Paar, 3000). Then, the contents of Li, Ga, and REE in digestion
solution were determined by an inductively coupled plasma emission
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, ICAP6000).

4.2.3 Determination
of Mineral Matter
X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, D2, Bruker)
with Cu Kα radiation
was used to determine the mineral matter in specimens, which were
scanned with a 2θ step size of 0.02° from 10 to 80°.
The mineral matter in ash samples was quantified by TOPAS software
(Version 4.2, Bruker). Zinc oxide was added into ash samples to determine
the content of minerals and amorphous matter.34 The detailed method was given in other literature data.35
