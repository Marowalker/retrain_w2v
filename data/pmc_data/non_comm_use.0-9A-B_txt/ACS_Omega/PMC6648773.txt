As it governs
the overall performance of lithium-ion batteries, understanding the
reaction pathway of lithiation is highly desired. For Co3O4 nanoparticles as anode material, here, we report an
initial conversion reaction pathway during lithiation. Using graphene
liquid cell electron microscopy (GLC-EM), we reveal a CoO phase of
the initial conversion product as well as morphological dynamics during
Co3O4 lithiation. In accordance with the in
situ TEM observation, we confirmed that the Co3O4 to CoO conversion is a thermodynamically favorable process by calculating
the theoretical average voltage based on density functional theory.
Our observation will provide a useful insight into the oxide electrode
that undergoes conversion reaction.

1 Introduction
Whereas lithium (Li)-ion batteries have been
widely used in various applications such as laptops, electric vehicles,
and so forth,1−3 high-capacity
anode materials are desired for light and portable devices.4,5 Cobalt (II,III) oxide (Co3O4) is one of the
promising materials because of its superior theoretical capacity (1100
mA h g–1).6−11 It is known that the Co3O4 anode has severe volume aggregation at high C-rates12 and undergoes either of two different lithiation
pathways.13 One pathway involves the Li-intercalation
process followed by full conversion to Co and Li2O    

The other is the reaction pathway through
the CoO phase, followed by full conversion to Co and Li2O    

Although the pathway accompanying the Li-intercalation process has
been frequently studied,14−16 the conversion process of Co3O4 to CoO is
still ambiguous because of a lack of direct observation.

Here,
we realize the direct observation on the initial conversion of Co3O4 to CoO upon lithiation by using graphene liquid
cell electron microscopy (GLC-EM), which has been used to acquire
high-resolution imaging in a liquid electrolyte solution.17−19 Furthermore, density functional
theory (DFT) calculation is adopted to calculate the relative voltage
profile, and the calculations confirm that the Co3O4 to CoO conversion follows a thermodynamic pathway.

2 Results and Discussion
Co3O4 nanoparticles are prepared by ball-milling
for 12 h. Figure 1a
shows a bright-field transmission electron microscopy (BF–TEM)
image of Co3O4 nanoparticles and Figure 1b shows the corresponding selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The diameters of particles
are 10–40 nm, which well correspond to the calculated average
crystal diameter of 24.6 nm from an X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
(Figure S1) according to Scherrer eq 1 1  

Figure 1 (a) BF–TEM image
(inset: particle size distribution graph) and (b) SAED pattern of
Co3O4 nanoparticles.

In order to investigate
the morphological dynamics during the initial conversion reaction,
in situ GLC–TEM is conducted. The GLC is prepared by encapsulating
liquid electrolyte with Co3O4 nanoparticles
between two graphene sheets. The liquid electrolyte is 1.3 M of (LiPF6) dissolved in a solvent mixture consisting of 3:7 volumetric
ratio of ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate (EC/DEC) and 10 wt
% of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), which was used in our previous
studies.17−19 Chemical lithiation
is initiated by the decomposition of LiPF6 to Li by dissolution
of electrons and radicals under electron beam irradiation.17−19 The schematic diagram of the
fabricated GLC is shown in Figure S2a.
A high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF–STEM) image and the corresponding energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of C, O, F, P, and Co are shown in Figure S2b to observe the morphology and element
distribution. Co3O4 nanoparticles are observed
inside the graphene sheets and liquid electrolyte, and all of the
chemical components of the electrolyte (C, O, F, P) are shown in all
parts of the HAADF–STEM image, but Co is selectively present
at the place where Co3O4 nanoparticles locate.

Using the GLC, a direct visualization on the initial conversion
reaction of Co3O4 to CoO is realized. The time-sequential
TEM images in Figure 2a show the lithiation process of individual Co3O4 nanoparticles. The conversion of Co3O4 to
CoO happens particle by particle (yellow to green to red). Ultrasmall
nanocrystals are generated and embedded within the amorphous matrix
and their morphology is similar to the lithiated Co3O4 particles in a previously reported work.20Figure 2b,c shows high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
images and corresponding crystal schematics, which confirm pre- and
post-lithiated crystal structures. During lithiation, clearly the
phase transition from Co3O4 to CoO occurred.
The total area change versus time is shown in Figure 2d. As lithiation and volume expansion happen
particle by particle, volume expansion occurs step by step. The formed
CoO nanocrystals and their total number is shown in Figure 2e. The number of nanocrystals
also increases step by step, which has a similar trend to the total
volume increase. The average size of the nanocrystals remains constant,
where stable morphology and phase are maintained during TEM observation
because of a small amount of liquid inside the GLC, which is not enough
to fully lithiate the particles.

HRTEM image and crystal structure of Co3O4 (before
lithiation) and (c) CoO (after lithiation). (d) Total area of the
particles with time. (e) Average size and number of CoO nanocrystals

In addition, this crystal structure
change is also identified with SAED patterns (Figure 3a,b). In accordance with HRTEM images, the
phase transition from Co3O4 to CoO is observed
in the GLC. In Figure 3c,d, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of the Co-L2,3 edge is shown before and after lithiation. The average ratios of
L3/L2 are measured as 2.39 and 4.51, which corresponds
to the value of Co3O4 (1/3 Co2+ and
2/3 Co3+) and CoO (Co2+) reported in previous
literature.20,21

situ TEM
experiment. (c) EELS spectrum of the Co-L2,3 edge before
and (d) after lithiation (inset: ratio between the L3 and
L2 peaks).

To further delve into the
theoretical aspects of the conversion reaction of Co3O4 to CoO, the average voltage V of electrode
is determined using the following equation, based on Nernst eq 2 2  where E(charge)
and E(discharge) are the DFT energies of the charged
and discharged phases, respectively. E(Li), x, and e are the DFT energy per atom of
bulk Li, the number of the Li atoms, and elementary charge, respectively.

Here, two different reaction pathways are considered and plotted
in Figure 4: (i) the
conversion of Co3O4 into CoO and (ii) the intercalation
of Li into Co3O4 (LiCo3O4). In the case of the first pathway, the formation of CoO takes place
at 2.08 V, and Co forms subsequently at 1.81 V. On the other hand,
the intercalation of Li into Co3O4 takes place
at 1.89 V, followed by conversion to Co at 1.86 V. According to the
Nernst equation, the high voltage value indicates low Gibbs-free energy
changes in the reaction pathway, which corresponds to thermodynamically
favorable reaction. On the basis of these results, the conversion
to CoO is a favorable process with respect to Li intercalation into
Co3O4. As lithiation in the GLC is chemical
lithiation,17−19 it
follows the thermodynamic reaction pathway and transition from Co3O4 to CoO takes place, which corresponds with our
GLC results.

Figure 4 DFT-based voltage profile
of the Li–Co3O4 system in the case of
conversion of Co3O4 to CoO (red) and intercalation
of Li into Co3O4 (LiCo3O4, blue).

To prove that the reaction in GLC–TEM actually
occurs in the real electrochemical battery cell experiment, ex situ
experiments are conducted. Figure S3a shows
the galvanostatic charge–discharge profile of the first cycle
and Figure S3b–d shows the SAED
patterns at each voltage level. At 1.2 V, the phase transition of
CoO is found and at the end of the discharge, both CoO and Co phases
are present. Ex situ EELS is also obtained to analyze the electronic
structure of lithiated Co3O4 (Figure S4). The positions and ratios of the L3 and
L2 peaks well match with the EELS spectrum from the in
situ experiment. Additional electrochemical information such as cyclic
voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance measurement, and galvanostatic
charge–discharge tests for subsequent cycles are provided in
the previous study.22 The CV analysis clearly
matches with the reaction pathway seen in this report, where two cathodic
peaks are present at 0.75 and 0.6 V, attributed to the reduction of
Co3O4 to CoO and subsequently CoO to Co.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
during the initial lithiation stage, we demonstrate that Co3O4 nanoparticles change into CoO phases rather than intercalation
phases using GLC–TEM. The DFT calculation further demonstrates
that the conversion of Co3O4 to CoO follows
a thermodynamic pathway, where chemical lithiation triggered in the
GLC is a thermodynamically favorable process. As the lithiation pathway
considerably affects the reaction kinetics, cycle retention characteristics,
and rate capabilities,23−25 our
study will provide an insight into designing anode materials of spinel
oxide with multiple oxidation states.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Fabrication of the GLC
Co3O4 nanoparticles were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
For the fabrication of the GLC, the multilayer graphene was initially
synthesized. Using Cu foil (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) as the substrate, graphene
was synthesized by using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then, the
Cu foil was etched with 20% phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%, Junsei) for 20 min for removing impurities and oxides. As
for the conditions of CVD, the temperature was set to 1050 °C
for 30 min and stabilized for 60 min under 200 standard cubic centimeters
per minute (sccm) of hydrogen (H2) gas. Subsequently, 20
sccm of methane (CH4) gas, which acted as the carbon source,
was injected for 25 min and was later cooled to room temperature at
a rapid rate. Such a synthesized multilayer graphene was transferred
to a holey carbon Au TEM grid (quantifoil, 300 mesh, hole size = 2
μm). Ammonium persulfate (0.2 M, (NH4)2S2O8, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to etch the Cu
foil for 6 h. Then, it was washed with water to remove the (NH4)2S2O8. The GLC was prepared
by dropping 20 μL of the electrolyte mixture containing Co3O4 nanoparticles, lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6), and EC/DEC (v/v = 3:7) with 10 wt % of FEC on one graphene-transferred
grid and placing another graphene-transferred grid on the top.26 Liquid cells were formed during spontaneous
drying by graphene sheets by the van der Waals force.

4.2 In Situ TEM Observation
To carry out the in situ TEM observation, a Titan ETEM G2 microscope (FEI) was used at an operating voltage of 300 kV. The
range of the electron beam dosage was between 800 and 1000 e–/Å2 s. The dynamics in the process of lithiation
upon e-beam irradiation were recorded in a charge-coupled device camera
(Gatan Ultrascan 1000). Furthermore, EDS elemental mapping was obtained
using JEOL JEM 2100F under a 200 kV accelerating voltage. EELS analysis
was conducted using GIF Quantum 966 in a Titan ETEM G2 microscope
(FEI).

4.3 Other Characterizations
The crystal structures of Co3O4 were confirmed
by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-2500, Rigaku) using Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). Ex situ TEM images and SAED patterns
of Co3O4 nanoparticles were taken using JEOL
JEM 2100F under a 200 kV accelerating voltage.

4.4 Particle Analysis
To measure the
average size and area of the particles, the following methods were
used. First, time-series images were extracted from the movie at 0.5
s intervals. Second, the edge of the CoO nanocrystals were drawn to
sharpen the boundaries. Finally, using “Analyze Particles”
plugins in ImageJ software, the number and area of nanocrystals were
calculated.

4.5 Computational
Details
DFT calculations are performed using the Vienna Ab
initio Simulation Package27 within the
projector-augmented wave scheme as formulated by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof28 with spin-polarization. A cutoff energy of 520
eV is adopted for the plane-wave expansion of wave functions and k-point grids of 1000/n are used with the
Monkhorst–Pack method for LiCo3O4 and
the γ-centered method for all others, where n is the number of atoms in the supercell. A Hubbard U term of 3.32 eV is chosen for Co2+ and Co3+ based on previous literature.14,29−32 The
DFT energies are converged within 1.0 × 10–6 eV. All structures in our study are based on those from the Materials
Project33 which are fully relaxed using
the aforementioned settings.

4.6 Ex Situ Electrochemical Test
The electrochemical cell
testing was conducted in a manner similar to the previously reported
literature.22 Briefly, the electrochemical
cells were fabricated in the Ar-filled glove box, with a 2032-type
coin cell. To start with, the slurry was made in a mortar, with Co3O4 nanoparticles, binder, and carbon black, in
a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The binder consisted of carboxymethyl cellulose
and polyacrylic acid, in a weight ratio of 1:1. The slurry was casted
onto the Cu foil, dried at 60 °C for 10 min, and dried inside
the vacuum oven at 150 °C for 2 h to completely remove the solvent.
The average amount of loaded active materials was 1.5 mg cm–2. The electrochemical cell was assembled with a counter electrode
(Li foil), a separator (Celgard 2325), a slurry-casted electrode,
a spacer, a spring, and an electrolyte. The electrolyte consisted
of 1.3 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in organic
solvent of EC/DEC with 10 wt % of FEC. The CV was conducted with a
scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in the voltage range of
0.01–3.0 V. After the specific electrochemical cell test, the
electrochemical cells were transferred to the antechamber of the glove
box, the cells were disassembled, and the electrode was washed with
dimethyl carbonate prior to analysis.
