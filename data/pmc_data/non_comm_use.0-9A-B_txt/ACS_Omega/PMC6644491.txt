The synthesized itaconic acid-based
dendritic amphiphile (Ita3C12) monomers and the methacryl
polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane
(MAPOSS) cross-linkers were directly introduced for the construction
of automatic vertical alignment (auto-VA) layers in the host nematic
liquid crystal (NLC) medium. The auto-VA layer can be stabilized by
irradiating UV light. For the automatic fabrication of a polymer-stabilized
multidomain VA (PS auto-MDVA) layer with a pretilt angle, Ita3C12 and MAPOSS were photopolymerized under the electric field
by irradiating UV light on the multidomain electrode cell. Mainly
because of the pretilted NLC at zero voltage, the electro-optic properties
of the PS auto-MDVA cell were dramatically improved. From the morphological
observations combined with surface chemical analyses, it was found
that various sizes of protrusions on the solid substrates were automatically
constructed by the two-step mechanisms. We demonstrated the PS auto-MDVA
cell with the enhancement of electro-optic properties as a single-step
process and investigated how the protrusions were automatically developed
during the polymer stabilization.

==== Body
Introduction
Liquid crystals (LCs)
have been widely studied and used in numerous
applications, especially in display industry, because of several advantages,
such as low power consumption, lightweight, thinness, and low manufacturing
cost.1−5 The LC display (LCD) is classified by types of LC alignment and
electrode technique.6−8 Various advanced LCD technologies have been developed
for twisted nematic,9,10 vertical alignment (VA),11,12 in-plane switching,13 and fringe-field
switching14,15 modes. Among them, the VA mode of LCD shows
not only advantages in the high contrast ratio and simple process
but also some technical drawbacks, such as slow response time and
narrow viewing angle.16−20 Therefore, the polymer-stabilized VA (PSVA) mode was suggested to
overcome these limitations and to improve the electro-optic properties,
such as fast response time, low power consumption, and wide viewing
angle. The conventional PSVA mode needs additional processes even
after the formation of VA layer: doping a small amount of reactive
monomers in the host nematic liquid crystal (NLC) medium and subsequently
polymer-stabilizing under an electric field larger than the threshold
voltage for memorizing the pretilt angle of the host LC molecules.
The fine modification of the pretilt angle is of importance for reducing
the response times in the PSVA mode.21−26

In our previous work, itaconic acid-based dendritic amphiphile
(Ita3C12) monomers were newly designed and synthesized
for the construction of automatic VA (auto-VA) layers in the LC cell.1 It was found that the auto-VA layers were successfully
fabricated by directly introducing Ita3C12 in the NLC medium.
Ita3C12, which was initially dissolved in the host NLC
medium, was gradually migrated toward the substrate for the formation
of self-assembled monolayers, which induced the VA of host NLC medium
from surface to bulk. The constructed auto-VA layer exhibited a strong
surface anchoring energy (1.404 × 10–4 J/m2) after polymer stabilization with a methacryl polyhedral
oligomeric silsesquioxane (MAPOSS) cross-linker. Furthermore, the
auto-VA layer after polymer stabilization was thermally stable even
though the temperature of the host NLC medium was increased to nematic–isotropic
transition temperature (TNI). However,
the polymer-stabilized automatic vertical alignment (PS auto-VA) cell
without the pretilt angle of NLC directors cannot be applied as a
real LCD device due to the slow response time, the increased threshold
voltage, and the narrow viewing angle.

In this study, we successfully
demonstrated the automatic fabrication
of polymer-stabilized multidomain VA layers with pretilted NLC medium
(polymer-stabilized multidomain VA (PS auto-MDVA)) by polymer stabilization
of the optimized amount of Ita3C12 monomers with MAPOSS
cross-linkers in a LC medium under the electric field by irradiating
UV light. The electro-optic properties of PS auto-MDVA cells were
significantly enhanced after polymer stabilization. It was realized
that the good mechanical and chemical stabilities of PS auto-MDVA
layers were mainly due to the polymerized Ita3C12/MAPOSS
protrusions on the solid substrates and the pretilted host NLC medium.
Additionally, we investigated the automatic formation of protrusions
by utilizing the combined techniques of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM).

Results and Discussion
Chemical and Morphological Studies of the
PS Auto-MDVA Cell
Ita3C12 monomers were synthesized
and polymerized with
MAPOSS cross-linkers for the construction of the PS auto-VA layer
in the NLC cell. The concentrations of Ita3C12 monomers
and MAPOSS cross-linkers were optimized for the fabrication of the
auto-VA layer on the entire area of the LC cell without generating
any light scatterings (Figure S1). The
PS auto-VA layers exhibited a strong surface anchoring energy (1.404
× 10–4 J/m2) similar to the conventional
VA layers and the mechanical properties that were thermally stable
even if the temperature of the host NLC was increased to TNI.1

To confirm the chemical
stability of the PS auto-VA layer, the Ita3C12/MAPOSS/LC
mixture was filled in a couple of cells. Both of them showed uniform
dark states (Figure S2a,d). One of the
LC cells was exposed to UV light for polymer stabilization, whereas
another LC cell was retained without UV treatment for comparison.
After the polymer-stabilization process in the former LC cell, the
host NLC medium was removed by a solvent mixture (methylene chloride
(MC)/n-hexane = 1/4). The disassembled LC cells were
washed with organic solvents, such as chloroform, MC, n-hexane, and acetone and reassembled. Thereafter, pure LC was injected
into the reassembled LC cells. The PS auto-VA cell showed uniform
dark states even after the reassembly process (Figure S2e). According to the conoscopic polarized optical
microscopy (POM) image represented in the inset of orthoscopic POM
image, the pure LC in the reassembled LC cell was vertically aligned
(Figure S2f). On the other hand, the auto-VA
cell without polymer stabilization showed a typical schlieren texture
(Figure S2b,c). That means, the auto-VA
layer was stable against organic solvent attacks and was fixed on
substrates after polymer stabilization. Furthermore, to investigate
the elemental composition of the PS auto-VA layer located on the substrates
of the LC cell, the fabricated PS auto-VA cells were disassembled
and those substrates were examined with XPS.27−29 The XPS data
for the PS auto-VA layers on the substrates is represented in Figure 1. As shown Figure 1a, C–C bond,
C–O bond, and C=O bond peaks were located on 284.8,
286, and 289 eV, respectively. The C–C bonds were alkyl chains
of Ita3C12 and MAPOSS, and the C–O and C=O
bonds were in the ester and carboxylic groups of ItaC12 and MAPOSS.27 In the case of oxide (O
1s scans), Si–O and metal oxide peaks were located at 532.9
and 530 eV, respectively (Figure 1b). The Si–O peak proved the presence of MAPOSS
as well as the glass area of the substrates. Note that both MAPOSS
and glass were composed of Si–O bonds.28,29 The metal oxide peaks were detected on the electrodes of the substrates.
The XPS result indicated the fact that the PS auto-VA layer located
on the substrates of LC cells was composed of polymerized Ita3C12/MAPOSS and fixed on the substrates. The PS auto-VA layer
was quite stable against chemical attacks even after the disassembly.

(C 1s) and (b) oxide (O 1s) spectra of chemical binding energy at
the protrusions on the substrates obtained after washing the unpolymerized
host LC medium.

In previous research,
we investigated the surface morphology of
the PS auto-VA layer on the substrates of the LC cell by AFM and recognized
that the PS auto-VA layer was composed of nanosized protrusions (Figure 2).1 In this study, to enhance electro-optic properties of the
PS auto-VA layer, the multidomain electrode cell designed for inducing
the formation of a multidomain LC medium and wide viewing angle was
used and Ita3C12 and MAPOSS in the LC medium were polymerized
under an electric field for generating pretilted LC directors. Furthermore,
to investigate the surface morphology of the PS auto-VA layer on the
substrates of the multidomain electrode cell, the PS auto-MDVA layer
was observed by AFM and field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM). When the auto-VA layer was constructed, Ita3C12 and MAPOSS were phase-separated and gradually migrated onto the
substrates. However, Ita3C12 self-assembled as a dimer
by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acids of Ita3C12 and the dimers were still dissolved in the host LC medium
and aligned parallel to the host LC molecules, as shown in Figure 3a. After the construction
of the auto-VA layer, electric field was applied to the fabricated
auto-VA LC cell (Figure 3b). Under the square-waveform electric field at 5.6 V, Ita3C12 and MAPOSS located on the substrates and in the LC medium
were polymerized by irradiating UV light (Figure 3c). Finally, when the electric field was
removed, the directors of host LC were aligned vertically with a slight
pretilt angle (about 2°) (Figure 3d).21−26 Note that the multidomain electrode substrates were consisted of
prominent electrode areas based on indium tin oxide (ITO) and nonelectrode
areas based on silicon oxide of the glass area of substrates.

of the PS auto-MDVA
cell. (a) Before polymer stabilization without an electric field,
Ita3C12 and MAPOSS are migrated on the electrode substrates
and induce LC vertical alignment. The self-assembled Ita3C12 dimers are still dissolved in the host LC medium. (b) Before polymer

reacted with each other, and the polymerized Ita3C12/MAPOSS
beads in the host LC medium are migrated into the electrode substrates.
(d) After polymer stabilization and without electric field: the host
LC molecules memorize the pretilt angles (about 2°) from vertical
alignment even after removing the electric field.

For investigating the protrusions on the substrate in detail,
FE-SEM
was used. According to FE-SEM images (Figure 4), after the construction of the auto-MDVA
layer, the VA layer on the electrode areas exhibited the protrusions
with 37 nm width in averaged values (Figure 4a). On the other hand, the VA layer on the
nonelectrode areas exhibited the protrusions with 17 nm width in averaged
values (Figure 4b).
From this result, several explanations were postulated that the sizes
of the protrusions were influenced by several factors, such as elastic
energy distribution of the host LC medium, caused under electric field,
and chemical affinity between MAPOSS and the materials of the substrate.
The elastic energy of the host LC medium is changed gradually when
the host LC molecules are reoriented under an electric field.30−35 To prove experimentally whether the electric field influenced the
determination of the sizes of protrusions, Ita3C12 and
MAPOSS were polymerized in the multidomain electrode cell without
applying electric field. The identical result was obtained, as shown
in Figure S3. After polymerizing Ita3C12 and MAPOSS without applying electric field, the protrusions
on the electrode areas exhibited 37 nm width in averaged values (Figure S3b) and those on the nonelectrode areas
exhibited 17 nm width in averaged values (Figure S3c). The widths of protrusions which are polymerized without
and with the electric field were matched up. It means that the elastic
energy change of the LC medium did not affect the determination of
the sizes of the protrusions on the substrates. To test other speculations,
the height of protrusions was measured by AFM.36−38 As represented
in Figure 5, the topographic
AFM images and their corresponding height profiles of the protrusions
on the substrates indicated that the heights of the protrusions on
the electrode areas were higher than those on the nonelectrode areas.
The heights of prominent electrodes were about 80 nm. After the construction
of the PS auto-VA layer, the VA layer on the electrode areas exhibited
the protrusions with 8 nm height in averaged values (Figure 5c,d). On the other hand, the
VA layer on the nonelectrode areas exhibited the protrusions with
4 nm height in averaged values (Figure 5e,f). From AFM and FE-SEM images, we discovered that
some protrusions were existed on the electrode and nonelectrode areas
as nanosized beads smaller than the protrusions on the nonelectrode
areas (Figure 5d,f).
These results can be supported by two mechanisms. The first is the
chemical affinity of MAPOSS and the materials of the substrate. When
the LC mixture was injected into the fabricated multidomain electrode
cell, automatic phase separation and subsequent migration onto substrates
were induced because of the low solubility of MAPOSS in the host LC
medium. The MAPOSS and nonelectrode areas were consisted of silicon
atoms; however, the electrode areas were not. Therefore, MAPOSS and
the nonelectrode areas have more chemical affinity than that of the
electrode areas. As a result, MAPOSS molecules on the electrode areas
were more aggregated themselves than those on nonelectrode areas (Figure 3a). When Ita3C12 and MAPOSS in the fabricated multidomain electrode LC cell
were polymerized by UV, the protrusions on the electrode areas were
bigger than those on the nonelectrode areas (Figure 3d). The second is phase separation induced
by the polymerization of Ita3C12 and MAPOSS in the host
LC medium. When Ita3C12 and MAPOSS in the LC medium were
polymerized by irradiating UV light, nanosized beads were formed in
the LC medium. The nanosized beads were no longer dissolved in the
LC medium, and phase separation against the LC medium was induced
by low solubility. Then, the nanosized beads of 2–4 nm were
gradually migrated onto the entire surfaces regardless of the substrate
materials. As a result, we confirmed that polymerizations were occurred
in the host LC medium and on the substrates of the LC cell simultaneously.

Improved Electro-Optic
Properties of the PS Auto-MDVA Cell
POM images and voltage-dependent
transmittance (VT) curves of the
fabricated PS auto-MDVA cell with the pretilt angle were investigated
to confirm the enhancement of electro-optic properties, such as threshold
voltage and response times. The threshold voltage can be defined as
the applied voltage when the LC cell has 10% of the maximum transmittance.39−42 The threshold voltage is an important factor in determining how
much energy is required to reorient the directors of the LC medium.
A decrease in the threshold voltage can be evidence for the fact that
the director of the LC medium is slightly tilted. Acorrding to voltage-transmittance
curves in Figure 6a,
the threshold voltage after polymer stabilization was decreased about
0.36 V at the voltage of 10% maximum of transmittance. The applied
electric field range was from 0 to 10 V.

transmittance curves before and after polymer
stabilization at 5.6 V, and (b) rising time vs grayscale for the PS
auto-MDVA LC cell before and after polymer stabilization. The time-resolved
LC textures at 5.6 V (c) before and (d) after polymer stabilization,
where the white scale bars correspond to 100 μm.

For the observation of time-resolved LC textures,
POM images were
obtained before and after polymer stabilization with the voltage applied.
Both the LC cells before and after polymer stabilization maintained
the dark states without applying any electric fields. This indicated
that the host LC was vertically aligned in initial states and the
LC directors were even slightly tilted after polymer stabilization.
Before polymer stabilization, LC directors were not tilted. Consequently,
the LC molecules without polymer stabilization were bumped with themselves
while applying the higher electric field than the threshold voltage.21−26 Therefore, the LC cell before polymer stabilization has a long time
to reorient the LC texture perfectly. When the electric field (5.6
V) was applied across the auto-MDVA cell before polymer stabilization,
schlieren textures were perfectly disappeared after 13 600
ms (Figure 6c). In
contrast, the PS auto-MDVA cell did not exhibit Schlieren textures
anymore and the response time of the reorientation of LC directors
at 5.6 V applied state was about 2000 times faster than before polymer
stabilization (6.1 ms). The results clearly indicate that the electro-optic
properties of the PS auto-MDVA cell are significantly enhanced by
the pretilt angle of the host LC medium.

Conclusions
For
automatically fabricating the polymer-stabilized (PS) multidomain
vertical alignment (MDVA) layer with a pretilt angle (PS auto-MDVA),
Ita3C12 monomers with MAPOSS cross-linkers were photopolymerized
in the LC medium under the electric field by irradiating UV light.
The fabricated PS auto-MDVA cell exhibited improved electro-optic
properties, such as lower threshold voltage, faster response time,
and wider viewing angle, which were mainly resulted from the induced
pretilt angle and the multidomain states of host LC molecules. On
the basis of the morphological observations combined with surface
chemical analyses, it was found that the protrusions formed on the
electrode areas (37 nm width and 8 nm height) were bigger than those
on the nonelectrode areas (17 nm width and 4 nm height) and the final
surface morphology was determined by the two-step mechanisms. Because
of the different chemical affinities between MAPOSS and the substrate
materials, the diffused MAPOSS on the electrode areas was first aggregated
to form bigger nanosized droplets rather than those on the nonelectrode
areas. Second, smaller nanosized beads were formed during the photopolymerization
of dissolved Ita3C12 and MAPOSS. The smaller nanosized
beads were further phase-separated against the host LC medium and
gradually diffused onto the entire substrates regardless of the chemical
affinities between MAPOSS and the substrate materials. We successfully
demonstrated a PS auto-MDVA cell with enhanced electro-optic properties
and additionally investigated the two-step mechanisms for the automatic
formation of protrusions on the multidomain electrode substrates during
polymer stabilization.

dendritic amphiphile
monomer (Ita3C12) was synthesized according to a previously
described method.1

Preparation of the Auto-VA
Cell and Auto-MDVA Cell
The PS auto-VA test cells were fabricated
by sandwiching two bare
electrode substrates. The bare electrode substrates were washed several
times with distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, and acetone. The washed
electrode substrates were further dried in a high-vacuum oven at 80
°C for 3 h. Two cleaned electrode substrates were attached to
each other and sealed with 5 μm cell gap tapes. The dimensions
of the auto-VA cell were 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm. The empty cells were
filled with the NLC mixture (NLC/Ita3C12/MAPOSS = 99.5/0.4/0.1
wt %). The LC mixture was prepared by stirring at 60 °C for 1
day.

The PS auto-MDVA cells were also fabricated by sandwiching
the nonpatterned ITO glass (upper one) and the multidomain electrode
substrate (downward one) provided by a display company. The multidomain
electrode substrates were carefully washed several times with distilled
water, isopropyl alcohol, and acetone and then dried in a vacuum oven
at 80 °C for 3 h. The cell gap of the fabricated cell was maintained
to be 5 μm by cell gap tapes. The typical dimensions of the
auto-MDVA cell were 2 cm × 2 cm. The homogenous LC mixture was
injected into the cells by capillary forces.

Characterization
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a JNM-EX400 spectrometer
in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) at room temperature. Chemical
shifts were quoted in parts per million (ppm) and referenced to tetramethylsilane.
Orthoscopic microphotographs and conoscopic textures were taken by
using cross-polarized optical microscopy (POM, Nikon ECLIIPSE E600POL)
with a LINKAM LTS 350 heating stage. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
images were taken on an Agilent 550 AFM (Agilent technologies) using
silicon cantilevers with spring constants of 20–30 N/m. The
scan speed varied from 0.0 to 1.0 line/s, and the resonance frequencies
were set as 140–160 kHz. The contact angle was measured by
a contact angle analyzer (Phoenix-300, SEO). Electro-optical switching
behaviors were measured by LCMS-200 (Sesim Photonics Technology, Korea).
A scanning electron microscope (SUPRA 40VP, Carl Zeiss) and an X-ray
photoelectron spectroscope (K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific) were utilized
for morphological and chemical investigations, respectively.
