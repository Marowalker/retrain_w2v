A simple
yet powerful flame chemical vapor deposition technique
is proposed that allows free control of the surface morphology, microstructure,
and composition of existing materials with regard to various functionalities
within a short process time (in seconds) at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure as per the requirement. Since the heat energy is directly
transferred to the material surface, the redox periodically converges
to the energy dynamic equilibrium depending on the energy injection
time; therefore, bidirectional transition between the semiconductor/metal
is optionally available. To demonstrate this, a variety of Sn-based
particles were created on preformed SnO2 nanowires, and
this has been interpreted as a new mechanism for the response and
response times of gas-sensing, which are representative indicators
of the most surface-sensitive applications and show one-to-one correspondence
between theoretical and experimental results. The detailed technologies
derived herein are clearly influential in both research and industry.

1 Introduction
Every
change in the world has a cause even if it is not scientifically
defined. Here, in natural sciences and engineering, it is defined
that the reaction takes place and that the reaction itself takes place;
there is already a subject of interest and another factor influencing
this subject. The physicochemical reactions, depending on the research
or practical purpose, can either help a reaction occur or can prevent
a reaction from happening. For example, catalysts such as Ag, Au,
Pd, and Pt help a reaction to occur at a higher rate.1−4 However, the coating layer that protects the surface of raw materials
serves to slow the original reaction, such as that observed in abrasion
resistance, toughness, weatherability, flame retardancy, solvent resistance,
waterproofness, and windproofness.5−8 The presence of two subjects in a reaction
indicates that, as in the case of mass in Einstein’s mass–energy
equivalence principle (E = mc2),9 the original energy of each
factor is not the same. Therefore, for these two subjects to behave
as a system, it is only necessary to reduce the energetic difference
and reach energy equilibrium. Then, according to the chemical reaction
rate equation,10 if the energy-quantity
difference such as the concentration as well as the energy-level difference
such as the wavelength of each of the two subjects are large, the
energy gradient will increase and, consequently, the reaction to equilibrium
will be accelerated. Conversely, if the energy difference between
them is small, the reaction to equilibrium will become slower. In
other words, the physicochemical change between the two entities depends
on the reaction and the rate of reaction; this qualitative and quantitative
relationship is already well-reflected in the thermodynamics.11,12 However, it is important to note that the two entities engaged in
energy exchanges do not necessarily have to be visible masses. That
is, it can be said that mass–mass, mass–energy, and
energy–energy pairs are all possible because mass itself represents
energy. For example, among the various types of energies such as light,
electricity, chemical, heat, nuclear, and sound,13−15 heat energy
in particular is a function of temperature, as seen in Q = c × m × ΔT, where Q, c, m, and ΔT are the heat (calorie),
specific heat, mass, and change in mass temperature, respectively.16 Therefore, through methods such as heat conduction,17 thermal convection,18 and thermal radiation,19 it is not only
directly involved in endothermic reaction,20 exothermic reaction,21 and enthalpy reaction22 of the two subjects, but also causes redox reaction23 and a change of state of solid–liquid–gas
materials.24 In this case, if one is the
thermal energy of a solid material and the other is the thermal energy
of the outer surface of the material, if the thermal energy outside
the material is larger than the thermal energy inside the material,
then energy transfer by direct contact between the matter and thermal
energy will be the most efficient because there is minimal loss in
the transfer process, rather than indirect energy transfer between
the material and the thermal energy through other mediators. That
is, in direct contact, the energy equilibrium between the two entities
is assumed to occur in the shortest time. However, despite this ideal
process, due to problems of temperature gradient and control by the
heat source, until now, the transfer of thermal energy to materials
has relied on indirect methods such as thermal evaporation,25 sputtering,26 hydrothermal
processes,27 metal organic chemical vapor
deposition,28 ion beam-assisted deposition,29 and atomic layer deposition.30 These methods mostly require vacuum conditions31,32 to (1) reduce the loss due to the intermediate medium, (2) increase
the transfer efficiency of heat energy via indirect heat transfer,
and (3) prevent the unwanted oxidation process at high temperatures,
except in some cases such as thermal interface materials, where vacuum
is not necessary.33,34 The first equilibrium of the
reaction of the two energies, whether by direct contact or via an
indirect medium, can be said to be the surface (the interface between
the two different energies) of the material.35 In other words, physicochemical changes in existing substances imply
that the reaction and equilibrium begin to affect the surface of the
material at least, even if the inside of the material is unaffected,
and these changes evidence the entry and exit of energy. In this study,
we introduce a simple yet powerful new technology that can arbitrarily
control the morphological, structural, and compositional changes of
a surface in a short time (within seconds) without the need of vacuum.
This method, called the “flame chemical vapor deposition (FCVD)”
herein, uses a flame that transfers the energy of the heat source
directly to the material, and thus, its thermal efficiency is higher
than that of indirect conventional processes and the larger energy
difference can be freely controlled to facilitate bidirectional transition
of a semiconductor (SnO2) to metal (Sn). Particularly,
since the oxidation reaction and reduction reaction of the substance
are easily controlled according to the energy injection time in a
short period (within seconds), it is clearly different from the conventional
deposition method, in which only one reaction can be selected between
the two reactions. That is, simplicity, operability, and efficiency
of this technology are superior. This approach eliminates the annoyance
of a path that has to go a long way (the existing process method)
toward the destination (surface functionalization) and suggests a
solution such as the shortest straight path (our method) to arrive
at the destination.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Beadlike Sn-Based Particles Obtained from
the Surface of Preformed SnO2 Nanowires (NWs)
Since SnO2 is a representative metal oxide semiconductor,
various methods for fabricating SnO2 NWs are already well-known.36−38Figure 1 shows the
typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1a,d,g,j) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure 1b,c,e,f,h,i,k,l)
images of the sample in which the Sn-based nanoparticles (NPs) as
a secondary phase were synthesized on the preformed SnO2 surface at intervals of 15 s within 1 min. As reported in previous
studies, usually in the case of a secondary phase, physicochemical
adsorption of noble metal particles on the surface enhances surface
reactivity,39,40 and a PN junction, which has
electrical properties opposite to those of the base, is induced (p-type
NP on n-type NW, and vice versa).41,42 However, in
special cases, even the size of the beads can be precisely controlled,
yielding a technology whereby the dimension of each bead can be sensitively
changed even at low humidity changes.43 However, even if such a multifunctional process can be accomplished
and a careful and precise process is feasible, considering the expense
required for the experimental setup and the amount of work over a
long period in vacuum, the fabrication of hybrid NWs with surface-adsorbed
NPs might not be cost-effective. Figure 1a–c show the typical distribution
of beadlike Sn-based NPs uniformly arranged along the length of the
uniform SnO2 NWs at room temperature formed by FCVD for
15 s. At this point, the NPs are roughly tens of nanometers in size;
however, occasionally, the FCVD energy is concentrated and sphere-like
Sn-based particles of several hundred nanometers in size compared
to conventional beads are observed. This morphological trend is observed
for FCVD process times of 30 s (Figure 1d–f), 45 s (Figure 1g–i), and 60 s (Figure 1j–l), and the difference in size of
the NPs is not noticeable to the eye; nevertheless, the density of
the NPs gradually increased. In the case of FCVD for 15 s (Figure 1a–c), relatively
sparse NPs were generated, whereas in 60 s (Figure 1j–l), the small NPs became so dense
that they adhered to the surface of large sphere-like Sn-based particles.
Under almost all of the FCVD conditions (Figure 1c,f,i,l), Sn-based particles are confirmed
to be crystalline rather than amorphous. To confirm this, low- and
high-magnification SEM images are shown in the Supporting Information. The bare SnO2 NWs are observed
to have a flat surface (Figure S1a–c), whereas the preformed SnO2 NWs formed for 120 s collapsed
(Figure S1p–r). Therefore, the process
time can be determined according to the type and microstructure desired.

durations of FCVD at room temperature. SEM, TEM, and high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images respectively showing surface changes of SnO2 NWs after FCVD for (a–c) 15 s, (d–f) 30 s,
(g–i) 45 s, and (j–l) 60 s.

2.2 Composition and Distribution of Sn-Based NWs
and NPs Depending on the Process Time
In the short time,
the composition of NPs formed on the existing SnO2 NWs
and the SnO2 NWs expected to be damaged due to incident
energy, as determined via point energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) and mapping measurements, are shown in Figure 2. First, the atomic ratio of O and Sn determined
by point EDX revealed that the NPs generated when energy was applied
for 15 s on the surface of SnO2 (Figure 2a–d) are composed of 100 atom % Sn,
which indicates complete reduction of SnO2 NWs (Figure 2b,d). With an increasing
process time, the oxidation reaction proceeds continuously and the
ratio of oxygen increases: for example, 43.21 atom % oxygen for a
process time of 30 s (Figure 2e–h) and 63.76 atom % oxygen for a process time of
45 s (Figure 2i–l).
Then, when the critical value is reached, that is, 59.89 atom % for
a process time of 60 s (Figure 2m–p), the reduction reaction, in which the ratio of
oxygen decreases, proceeds again. In other words, it can be interpreted
that oxidation and reduction approach dynamic equilibrium as reduction
and oxidation repeatedly occur within the range where the initial
SnO2 does not collapse. However, the EDX mapping data (Figure 2c,d,g,h,k,l,o,p)
show that the interiors of the existing SnO2 NWs continuously
maintain the composition of tin and oxygen. Thus, FCVD is the optimal
method for functionalizing a surface in a short period. The same conclusions
as those drawn from EDX and mapping analyses were derived from the
XPS measurement (Figure S2) as well as
the interplanar spacing measurement from the line profile in HRTEM
(Figure S3). In short, only the equilibrium
of the FCVD reaction proceeding for 15 s tended toward full reduction,
resulting in the presence of Sn alone (Figures S2a,b and S3a–c).44,45 Thereafter, the oxidation
progresses for process times of 30 and 45 s (Figures S2c,d and S3d–i), and reduction proceeds again at a
process time of 60 s, indicating the formation of SnO2 (Figures S2e and S3j–l).

2.3 Change
in the Work Function of SnO2 NWs with Sn-Based Particles
Due to Surface Change
To determine
the change in the energy of the preformed SnO2 due to the
FCVD method generating a heterogeneous material on the surface, we
examined the work function46 of five different
samples, including bare SnO2 NWs, via ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Figure 3a). At this time, as shown in Figure 3, since the energy of the incident
beam is 21.2 eV, the work function of each sample (SnO2 NWs + particle of surface) can be obtained by subtracting the cut-off
energy value at 21.2 eV and adding the equipment correction value
of 0.1 eV. Thus, the obtained work function values are 4.25 eV (Figure 3b), 4.4 eV (Figure 3c), 4.6 eV (Figure 3d), 4.5 eV (Figure 3e), and 4.55 eV (Figure 3f) corresponding
to the samples fabricated under bare conditions and by the FCVD process
with 15 s increments in the process time. As mentioned earlier (Figure 2), as the density
of nanoparticles increases (i.e., as the FCVD process continues),
the oxidation and reduction reactions alternately decrease in width,
and the work function can be considered closer to the work function
of the constant dynamic equilibrium with a decrease in the range of
the work function. Then, since the change in sample is similar to
that in bare SnO2 NWs, as shown in photoluminescence (PL)
(Figure S4a)47 and Raman (Figure S4b)48 analyses, only the peak intensity of the oxygen defects
are different, whereas the peak positions are not significantly different.
That is, the change in work function under different conditions does
not imply the creation of a new bandgap, and the absence of new peaks
in the Raman spectrum confirms that no new material is synthesized.

and (f) 60 s FCVD SnO2 NWs.

2.4 Semiconductor–Metal Bidirectional Transitions
on the Surface of SnO2 NWs from NO2 Gas-Sensing
As mentioned above, because the FCVD process is more sensitive
to the surface changes in the sample, NO2 gas-sensing was
performed to confirm this. As shown in Figure 4, NO2 gas-sensing was conducted
at relatively low temperatures such as room temperature (Figure 4a), 100 °C (Figure 4b), and 150 °C
(Figure 4c), and sensing
parameters such as the response (Figure 4d), response time (Figure 4e), and recovery time (Figure 4f) were evaluated for each temperature. The
most important aspect was that the best response was obtained for
FCVD for 15 s regardless of the temperature (Figure 4a–d). In particular, the surface reactivity,
which is almost seven times even at room temperature through a simple
process in seconds can be said to be superior to the result of NO2 gas-sensing in the meantime.49,50 As seen in Figure 2, this is because
a process time of 15 s forms metal Sn particles on the surface of
the SnO2 NWs and these metal NPs play a spillover role
in the prolonged adsorption of NO2 gas.51,52 Moreover, with an increase in temperature, the sensing response
of the samples at 30–60 s increases and becomes greater than
that of the sample at 15 s because semiconductors are more sensitive
to temperature than metals;53 therefore,
the work function change of the semiconductor comprising a compound
of Sn and O at 30–60 s is larger than that of the Sn metal.
The representative NO2 gas-sensing indicators are summarized
in Table 1.

2.5 One-to-One Correspondence Mechanism of Surface
Change and Gas Reaction of SnO2 NWs at Room Temperature
The NO2 gas-sensing data presented in Figure 4 depend on the FCVD process
conditions; therefore, it is necessary to objectify them to one-to-one
correspondence as to why and how they are causal. To do so, it is
important to understand precisely the meaning of gas-sensing indicators
such as the response time and response. Since all of the data except
for the sensing data are obtained at room temperature, the gas-sensing
at room temperature is based on their correlation. First, the response
time of the surface of the SnO2 NW sample with adsorbed
particles is considered as an index of the change in the response
speed since the change in surface area affects the carrier channel
from the gas-sensing perspective. Therefore, the change in work function
shown in Figure 3 is
due to the surface change through FCVD, and the change in work function
can be regarded as an index of the response speed change of the gas
sensor. As shown in Figure 5a, a significant graph of work function and response time
(Figure 5c) relationship
was obtained from the experimental results. Second, at room temperature,
the response is a factor that links how much gas has affected the
surface, which can be considered as a direct correlation between the
type of material, surface area, and gas concentrations that are brought
into contact with the gas. This is a factor related to the quantity,
such as intensity, and in the gas sensor field, this is traditionally
increased by functionalizing the particle on the surface to produce
a spillover effect. This spillover effect can be different depending
on the kind of material that produces the effect. Since NWs and NPs
formed from a single material, such as in this experiment, do not
change between different materials, only the surface structure and
particle metallization can be the variables under a single concentration.
However, when the structure is considered to be similar, the degree
of metallization of the particle, that is, the atomic concentration
of Sn, can be regarded as a factor related to the response. As shown
in Figure 5b, a significant
relationship exists between the response (Figure 5d) and Sn concentration. However, all of
these results are obtained at room temperature. Thus, as seen in Figure 4, when the temperature
increases to 100 and 150 °C, the response order does not change;
however, the response time or recovery time changes. This implies
that the Sn concentration is not temperature-dependent at these temperatures;
however, the work function of the sample is temperature-dependent.
This inference is consistent with the temperature dependence of the
above-mentioned semiconductor. In this way, the interpretation of
the gas-sensing mechanism as a response time of the entire sample
and response of the local sample is another advanced interpretation
compared with the previous research results. Hence, undoubtedly, the
entire process, from a similar kind of synthesis to a sensing application
mechanism, will serve as an important reference in the future.

3 Conclusions
Hybrid nanomaterials functionalized with Sn-based beads with different
characteristics were fabricated under various FCVD conditions within
1 min on preformed SnO2 NWs. This technology can be used
to control the oxidation and reduction reactions newly evolved from
the vacuum-based deposition process so far and a combination of a
semiconductor–metal or semiconductor–semiconductor is
freely available from the preformed SnO2. To support these
theories, a customized verification was performed by various surface
measurements such as SEM and TEM for morphological analysis, EDX,
elemental mapping, XPS, PL spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy for
elemental composition analysis, HRTEM for microstructural analysis,
UPS for energetic relationship determination, and NO2 gas-sensing
for practical applications. The advantages of FCVD, presented herein
for the first time, are remarkable in terms of time, cost, and practicality.
Therefore, it is believed that not only the SnO2 material
presented here but also other materials can be continuously developed
in both the research and engineering sectors by this approach.

4 Experimental Section
First, 1 g of tin powder (99.9%)
was placed in an alumina boat
and positioned at the center of a horizontal tube furnace. Then, a
silicon substrate was placed on it upside down. SnO2 nanowires
were fabricated by heating at 900 °C under 50 sccm oxygen gas
and 100 sccm argon gas for 1 h. The pressure was maintained at 1 Torr.
The surface of the SnO2 nanowires was modified by performing
flame chemical vapor deposition (FCVD) directly on them. Here, a temperature
of 1300 °C was instantaneously applied under 50 sccm butane and
50 sccm argon gas. The process time was divided into units of 15 s,
up to 120 s, to obtain the samples.

The obtained samples were
analyzed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Hitachi S-4200) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 200
kV, JEOL JEM-2010, Japan) to observe the morphologies; energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS, K-Alpha plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), photoluminescence
(PL) spectroscopy (LabRAM HR800, Jobin Yvon, France), and Raman spectroscopy
(Raman, LabRAM HR800, Jobin Yvon, France) were performed to determine
the chemical distributions; high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) was used to observe the microstructures; and ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Theta probe base system, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.) was carried out to evaluate the work function. Finally,
the samples were used for NO2 gas-sensing to determine
the surface reactivity.

For the gas-sensing experiment, an interdigitated
electrode was
formed on the sample, following which a sensor element was formed
by wire bonding. Subsequently, the sensing performance toward 10 ppm
NO2 gas was measured at room temperature, 100, and 150
°C, and the sensing parameters such as response, response time,
and recovery time were calculated. The response is expressed as the
ratio Rg/Ra, where Rg is the resistance in NO2 gas and Ra is the resistance
in air atmosphere. The response time showed up to 90% of the response
time, and the recovery time showed up to 90% of the recovery time.
