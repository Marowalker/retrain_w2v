The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mitigates the
flux of
methane from marine sediments into the water column. AOM is performed
by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) that reverse the methanogenesis
pathway and partner bacteria that utilize the released reducing equivalents
for sulfate reduction. Here, we investigated small-molecule extracts
from sediment-free thermophilic enrichment cultures of ANME-1 and
sulfate-reducing bacteria using ultraperformance liquid chromatography
with high-resolution mass spectrometry. During the analysis, we discovered
a novel thioquinoxalinol-containing redox molecule as a major component
of the chemically derivatized small-molecule pool. This compound contains
both a redox active quinoxaline heterocyclic ring and a thiol group.
Additionally, the same core structure was identified that contains
a sulfate ester on the hydroxyl group, which likely makes the molecule
more water soluble. Hydrated versions of both structures were also
observed as major compounds in the extracts. On the basis of reactions
of model compounds such as quinoxalin-6-ol, the hydrated version appears
to be formed from the addition of water to the dehydropyrazine ring
followed by an oxidation. These thioquinoxalinol compounds, which
represent completely new structures in biochemistry, may be involved
in electron transport processes within and/or between ANME-1 and sulfate-reducing
bacteria, may serve protective roles by reacting with toxic compounds
such as hydrogen sulfide, or may transport sulfate as a sulfate ester
into the sulfate-reducing bacteria.

==== Body
Introduction
Organisms across all domains of life produce
an extensive suite
of small molecules that play critical roles in life processes. For
example, coenzymes such as pyridoxal phosphate and thiamine-pyrophosphate
allow enzymatic reactions to occur that are not possible by proteins
alone, while others including coenzyme A, coenzyme M, vitamin B12, folates, and methanopterin, function as carrier molecules
for metabolic intermediates. Furthermore, completely new coenzymes
or modifications to currently known coenzymes continue to be discovered.1−3 Other small biomolecules are involved in essential processes such
as electron transfer carried out by flavin- and nicotinamide-containing
cofactors, biochemical signaling such as homoserine lactones in quorum
sensing, or metal-binding performed by siderophores.

The anaerobic
oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulfate as the terminal
electron acceptor is carried out by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea
(ANME) existing in consortia with syntrophic bacteria in marine anaerobic
environments. Given the key role of methane in the global carbon cycle
as well as its concerning and increasing role as a greenhouse gas,
a detailed biochemical understanding of methane sources and sinks
is critical. ANME utilize a reverse methanogenic pathway to oxidize
methane to CO2, thereby limiting the amount of methane
that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.4 Because of the lack of electron sinks,
ANME shuttle reducing equivalents via an unconfirmed mechanism to
sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which use the electrons in their
own energy metabolisms to reduce sulfate to sulfide.5−7 Sulfate-coupled AOM is performed by three different described clades
of ANME that vary widely in terms of phylogeny, ecology, and physiology.7,8 The metagenome of ANME-1 from Black Sea mats was first published
in 2010,9 followed by genomes of meso-
and thermophilic ANME-1 archaea.10 In general,
the presence of partner bacteria is essential for ANME activity, whereas
at least Candidatus Desulfofervidus auxilii, the partner bacteria of thermophilic ANME-1, can be cultured independently
in the presence of hydrogen and sulfate as the sole redox couple.11 Current evidence indicates that direct interspecies
electron transfer occurs between ANME and SRB, as opposed to metabolic
by-products, such as hydrogen or formate, being produced by ANME and
consumed by the partner bacteria.12−16 Electron transfer is likely mediated by small molecule
and/or protein bound redox carriers, and the transfer may be facilitated
by intercellular wiring consisting of pili-like connecting structures.13 The presence of multiheme cytochromes encoded
in the genomes of ANME supports the involvement of these proteins
in interspecies electron transfer,13,16 but this has
not been confirmed and other electron carriers may also be involved.

Here, we studied the small-molecule molecular inventory of thermophilic
AOM enrichments containing ANME-1 and Ca. D. auxilii partner bacteria.
These microbial consortia have extremely low growth rates and yields,
with doubling times of about 2 months.17 Thus, investigating their biochemistry is difficult because obtaining
enough cellular material for many traditional biochemical analyses
is currently out of reach. Therefore, here we take advantage of the
sensitivity of mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze and characterize
small molecules present in these consortia to reveal unique biochemical
insights into AOM.

In our nontargeted analysis by ultraperformance
liquid chromatography–high-resolution
electrospray ionization–MS (UPLC–HR-ESI–MS),
we identified and characterized a series of novel biomolecules. We
propose chemical structures for the four related molecules containing
a common thioquinoxalinol core structure (Figure 1). The thioquinoxalinol structure has some
similarities to the methanophenazine electron carrier first isolated
in Methanosarcina mazei,18 as well as FAD, NAD, and menaquinone. However,
unlike these established redox cofactors, the thioquinoxalinol molecules
described here also have a thiol group, which could be involved in
connecting thiol redox reactions with the reduction of the quinoxaline
ring.

Figure 1 Proposed chemical structures of the bimane-sulfoxide derivatized
thioquinoxalinol-containing molecules (A–D) identified in this
work. The core parts of the molecules obtained from the cells are
in red, while the chemically derivatized portions are in black. The
molecules are shown in their protonated forms as detected by ESI–MS.

Results and Discussion
Summary of the Identification of the Proposed Thioquinoxalinol-Containing
Compounds
This work was specifically undertaken to explore
AOM cultures for novel low molecular weight molecules that would reveal
new biochemistry occurring within and/or between ANME-1 and their
SRB partners. In our established workflow, water/methanol-soluble
cell extracts were prepared and the mass spectral data were analyzed
for the presence of potentially unique molecules identified based
on their measured exact masses and isotopic peak abundances. We then
attempt to determine structures by comparing with similar known molecules
and finally by the chemical synthesis of the molecule of interest
or the synthesis of structural analogues.

Because we were specifically
interested in thiol-containing compounds in this work, the cell extracts
from ANME-1/SRB consortia were derivatized with bimane. This procedure
results in thioethers and shields the compounds from oxidation when
exposed to air. The resulting thioether from the bimane derivatization
was subsequently oxidized to the sulfoxide and then analyzed by UPLC–HR-ESI–MS.
Several major peaks were observed in the total ion chromatogram that
appeared to be related compounds of unknown identity (Figure 2). The characteristics of the
oxidized bimane derivatives were used to establish that all of the
molecules contained a single thiol group. Based on the exact masses
of the molecules, their fragmentation patterns, and the measured isotopic
cluster intensities of the intact molecules and their fragments, we
were able to propose likely structures for four related thioquinoxalinol-containing
molecules. The basic structure contains a reduced thioquinoxalinol
core with a thiol and a methylated nitrogen (Figure 1). The most abundant molecule observed, and
likely the native biologically-active version, has a sulfate-ester
(Figure 1A). Finally,
hydrated versions of each of these were also observed as major peaks
(Figure 1B,D). Each
of the four compounds identified were observed as multiple peaks (Figure 2) with the retention
times and masses indicated in Table 1, with each peak having the same masses and very similar
fragmentation patterns, indicating the formation of different stable
isomers. These compounds were not detected in growth media after the
growth of these cells nor were they detected in the cells of methanogens
or their spent media. In the next sections, we will elaborate on the
structural characterization of these novel biomolecules.

minor peaks in the 415.147 trace result from the fragmentation of

showing a (M2 + H)+ ion. Each (M + H)+ and (M2 + H)+ ions all showed the (M + Na)+ ions at
the expected masses. The 495 and 513 34S isotopic ions
all indicated the presence of two sulfur atoms and the 415 and 433 34S isotopic ions both indicated the presence of one sulfur
atom. The recorded 495/415 and 513/433 ion intensity ratios indicate
the different efficiencies at which the sulfated molecules lose SO3. nd = not determined due to interference by another peak.

Characteristics of the Bimane-Sulfoxide Form of Thioquinoxalinol
Sulfate
The first thioquinoxalinol-containing molecule that
we identified and characterized was the bimane-sulfoxide derivatized
thioquinoxalinol sulfate (Figure 1A). From the measured mass of 495.101 and the fact
that it contained two sulfurs, the elemental formula of the derivative
was likely C20H23N4O7S2. The mass spectrum of the 10.86 min eluting peak is shown
in Figure 3. Because
the sample had been converted into a sulfoxide, this left the original
thioquinoxalinol sulfate with an elemental formula of C10H12N2O4S2. The calculated
mass for thioquinoxalinol sulfate measured from the (M + H)+ from each peak observed in the order eluted in Figure 2 were 494.091, 494.091, 494.095,
and 494.093. The isotopic intensities measured for the (M + H)+ ion were M + 1 = 20%, M + 2 = 9.6%, and M + 3 = 1.8%; from
the (M + Na)+ ion were M + 1 = 20%, M + 2 = 9.8%, and M
+ 3 = 1.1%; and from the M+ – SO3 ion
was were M + 1 = 20%, M + 2 = 5.36%, and M+ + 3 = 0.7%.
Taken together, these isotopic abundances confirm that the parent
molecule contained two sulfur atoms and the M+ –
SO3 ion contains one sulfur. The peaks containing thioquinoxalinol
sulfate also showed (M2 + H)+ = 989.190, (M2 + Na)+ = 1011.171, (M3 + H)+ = 1483.294, (M3 + Na)+ = 1505.270, and (M3 + K)+ = 1521.242, further confirming the mass
of the parent molecule. An unexpected observation was that only some
of the isomers formed both (M2 + H)+ at 989.190
and (M3 + H)+ ions (Table 1), which we currently do not have an explanation
for.

Figure 3 (A) Mass spectrum observed for the bimane sulfoxide derivative
of thioquinoxalinol sulfate. The spectrum was that recorded at the
elution time of 10.86 min in Figure 2. (B) Unexpected fragmentation of the bimane-sulfoxide
derivative produced a substituted sulfine and protonated methylbimane,
the latter of which is observed as the base peak in the mass spectrum
(m/z = 193.096).

The mass spectra of the molecules contained an
intense 193.096
fragment ion (Figure 3A), arising from the bimane-sulfoxide derivative, as the base peak.
This 193.096 ion is observed along with 191.084 and 192.085 in the
ESI fragmentation of thiol-containing compounds derivatized with bimane.
The 193 ion occurs as a major ion in ∼40% of molecules producing
these three ions, but never as the base peak. This fragmentation ion
would originate by an elimination of a reduced methylbimane with the
formation of a sulfine (Figure 3B). The occurrence of such a fragment in other molecules has
been previously observed.19 These data
indicate that the carbon atom attached to the sulfoxide and quinoxalinol
contained at least one hydrogen.

The mass spectrum of the bimane-sulfoxide
derivative of thioquinoxalinol
sulfate has a strong fragment ion at 415.147 (Figure 3A). This corresponds to a mass loss of 79.968
corresponding to the neutral loss of SO3 from the (M +
H)+ ion, indicating a possible sulfate ester-containing
molecule. Importantly, this fragment could not arise from the loss
of PO3 from a phosphate monoester because it would have
a mass loss of 78.958 from the (M + H)+. Alkyl monosulfate
esters are known to fragment with the loss of H2SO4.20 Negative mode ESI–MS
analysis of a series of aromatic sulfate esters revealed a neutral
loss of SO3, whereas nonaromatic sulfate esters do not
fragment in this way.21 These observations
indicated that the molecule of interest here contained an aromatic
sulfate ester. The reduction in the intensity of (M + H)+ + 2 from the presence of 34S in the (M + H)+ ion compared with the (M + H)+ – SO3 ion indicated the fragment contained one of the two sulfurs present
in the molecule. The intensity of the +2 isotope ion from the measured
989.190 corresponding to (M2 + H)+ again indicated
the molecule contained two sulfur atoms.

Characteristics of the Bimane-Sulfoxide Form of Thioquinoxalinol
The bimane-sulfoxide form of the thioquinoxalinol without a sulfate-ester
(Figure 1C) had a measured
mass of 415.147. This would leave the mass of the core structure at
208.067 after the subtraction of the bimane and sulfoxide modifications
and result in an elemental formula of C10H11N2OS. There are no compounds reported in SciFinder with
this elemental formula that have the characteristics that we have
described. Considering that the original structure must have one thiol
group, one phenol, two nitrogens, and six sites of unsaturation, only
a few biochemically relevant structures are possible; one is that
proposed here (Figure 1C) and the others are positional isomers of this structure.

Taken together, the mass spectral data are consistent with the structures
of the thioquinoxalinol molecules shown in Figure 1. Two major aspects of the structure remain
ambiguous due to the fact that MS does not easily reveal positional
isomers. The first is that the methyl group could be on the other
nitrogen, and the second is that the hydroxyl (or sulfate) group could
be on either the 7th or 8th position of the quinoxaline ring. The
position of this hydroxyl group in our proposed structure is the same
as that found in methanophenazine, which is a well-characterized redox
molecule in methanogens.18 Analysis of
a pure cell pellet of Ca. D. auxilii for the thioquinoxalinol compounds
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and UV absorbance showed that they
are below the limit of detection (∼5 nmol/g dwt) in these samples.
This indicates that the ANME in the consortia are producing the compounds,
thus supporting their relation to methanophenazine in methanogens.

Evidence for the Proposed Structures Based on Comparisons to
Synthetic Analogues
To further support the proposed structure
of the molecule from the AOM consortia, we adapted literature procedures
for the chemical synthesis of a thioquinoxalinol (Figure S1). The final derivatized synthetic product had a
completely oxidized ring and thus was two mass units lower than the
thioquinoxalinol isolated from the cells (m/z 413.194 vs 415.143). The synthetic procedure yielded four
different isomers (Figure S2). Mass spectral
analysis of these synthetic products showed the characteristic protonated
methylbimane fragment (Figure 3B). To provide further support for this base peak ion observed
with the bimane-sulfoxide derivatives of the compounds studied here,
the bimane-sulfoxide derivative of mercaptoethylpyrazine was prepared
in the same manner as the samples from the cells and purified by preparative
TLC. This molecule also produced the same m/z 193.0972 fragment, showing that this related model thiol
compound also fragments to produce a protonated methylbimane.

We next wanted to investigate the potential redox properties of these
newly discovered biomolecules. Because the above synthetic procedure
yielded low amounts of the final products, we instead studied the
properties of the core quinoxaline without the sulfate and thiol functionalities.
Thus, quinoxaline-6-ol was methylated with methyl iodide, and the
products were assayed by TLC to reveal two colored spots which were
purified by preparative TLC. LC–MS analysis revealed that the
top spot was the starting material and the lower spot was the methylated
product. The bottom spot contained two compounds both with a M+ = 161.1, resulting from having one methyl on the nitrogen
on the same side as the hydroxyl group (7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-1-ium, Figure S3) and the other having the methyl group
on the opposite side from the hydroxy group (7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-4-ium).
This mixture was readily reduced with dithionite, and the UV–vis
spectrum recovered upon exposure to air, thus demonstrating the redox
active characteristics of the model compound.

Characterization of the Hydrated Forms of Thioquinoxalinol Derivatives
In addition to thioquinoxalinol sulfate, we also observed a series
of peaks with the mass of bimane-sulfoxide thioquinoxalinol sulfate
but corresponding to the addition of water. These molecules had a
mass of 513.116 which is 18.0106 higher than thioquinoxalinol sulfate
(Figure 1). In the
UPLC–HR-ESI–MS measurements, five peaks with this mass
were observed (Figure 2 and Table 1). Possible
routes for the formation of these compounds from thioquinoxalinol
sulfate are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Possible routes for the enzymatic and chemical conversion of reduced
thioquinalinol sulfate into the water addition products. The indicated
reactions could occur either before or after the formation of the
derivatives.

The reason for this addition of water is not clear,
but the fact
that five peaks were observed indicates that some of the formation
represents side reactions not related to the true function of this
molecule because the multiple peaks are a result of racemic products.
To test this with our model compounds, the 7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-4-ium
and 7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-1-ium mixture was exposed to sodium
hydroxide in the presence of air, which indeed generated a hydroxylated
form (Figure S4A). Many examples exist
where hydroxide is known to add to the electrophilic sites of oxidized
coenzymes. A prime example of this is the addition of water to NAD+.22 Additionally, diquaternary
salts of pyrazines are known to undergo the addition of alcohols with
no change in the redox state,23 and quinoxalines
undergo redox reactions at a carbon electrode to produce water addition
products as the result of the formation of a 1,4-didehydro product.25 It has also been reported that 1,4-dihydroquinoxaline
can undergo the addition of water during electrochemical studies but
the mechanism is not clear. A similar mechanism has been reported
for lumazine.24

Another route for
the formation of the water adduct could start
with the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the 7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-4-ium
and 7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-1-ium mixture. Thus, we treated 7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-1-ium
mixture with hydrogen peroxide and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride (TCEP) as was done during the isolation of the cell
extract sample. The product obtained was 7-hydroxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-one (Figure S4B). We propose
that a peroxide anion adds to the C-2 carbon of 7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-1-ium
and the generated hydroperoxide is reduced to an alcohol with the
TCEP, a well-known reaction.25 The resulting
enamine then undergoes a rearrangement to form the enol alcohol that
undergoes a rearrangement to form the stable product, 7-hydroxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-one. This compound cannot be oxidized back to 7-hydroxy-1-methylquinoxalin-1-ium.

Reason for the Occurrence of Several Different Isomers
As indicated in Table 1, each of the bimane-sulfoxide containing derivatives showed multiple
chromatographic peaks. The presence of these multiple peaks can be
explained as a result of different stereochemistries at the chiral
atoms (circled in Figure S5). Because the
sulfoxides were generated by chemical oxidation, they will be composed
of two possible stereoisomers. Furthermore, depending on the route
for the water addition, additional chiral centers will be generated.
These chiral centers will lead to diastereomers which will generate
multiple LC peaks for both thioquinoxalinol, thioquinoxalinol sulfate,
and their hydrated forms.

Analysis of Thioquinoxalinol Bimane Thioethers
We also
analyzed cell extracts that were derivatized with bimane but not oxidized
to the sulfoxide. Scanning of the data for the expected different
forms of the bimane derivatives indicated the presence of three of
the thioquinoxalinol-containing molecules (Figure S6). The most intense form detected was the hydrated form with
no sulfate ester with a measured mass of 415.147. The next most abundant
peak was the completely oxidized form of the intact compound with
a measured mass of 477.0897. The least intense peak was the intact
cofactor but with quinoxaline ring reduced by (2H+ + 2e–) with a measured mass of 479.1054. The elution times
of the molecules matched their expected polarities.

Abilities of Quinoxalines, Pyrazines, and Phenazines To Undergo
Redox Reactions
Although the literature lacks data on the
reduction potentials of any thioquinoxalinol molecules, data have
been reported for comparable redox active compounds. The closest analogues
are ubiquinone, phenazine methosulfate, and pyocyanin with established
reduction potentials of +113,26 +80,27 and −34 mV,28 respectively. These data indicate that thioquinoxalinol is likely
to have a mid-range reduction potential. The effect of the addition
of the sulfate ester is hard to predict, and the redox properties
could be substantially different if the molecule is bound to a protein.

Analysis by UV–vis spectrophotometry revealed that N-methylated
quinoxaline-6-ol is readily reduced by dithionite, whereas quinoxaline-6-ol
and thioethylpyrazine cannot be reduced with dithionite. It thus appears
that the introduction of the methyl group on the nitrogen to generate
a quaternary nitrogen is required for the compound to be reduced by
dithionite (−660 mV). Quaternary salts of pyrazine29 and quinoxalines30 can be N-methylated with methyl iodide. The diquaternary salts can
only be prepared using oxonium salts, which are stronger alkylating
reagents.23 These resulting methylated
compounds can undergo redox reactions,31,32 thus supporting
the role of the thioquinoxalinol molecule discovered here as a redox
active compound.

5-Methylphenazonium methyl sulfate (phenazine
methosulfate) is
a well-established electron carrier that can replace flavins in flavoproteins.33 It undergoes reduction with NADH as well as
other reducing agents. Phenazine itself can be readily reduced to
5,10-dihydrophenazine which is unstable in air,34 and such reduced phenazines readily reduce ferric (hydr)oxides,
which may play an important role in the iron uptake.35 Pyrazine and quinoxaline heterocycles have established
redox characteristics, where they can be reduced in aqueous solutions
both electrochemically36 and with titanium(III)
chloride37 and can undergo two one-electron
transfers.38 Pyrazine is completely reduced
to piperazine by nickel–aluminum alloy39 and quinoxaline can also be reduced to 1,4-dihydroquinoxaline,40−42 which appears to be stable in air. This is analogous to NADH which
is also stable in air in the reduced form. Electrochemical reduction
produces 1,4-dihydropyrazines, which are unstable to isolate and isomerize
into 1,2- or 1,6-dihydropyrazines.41 Hydroxyquinolines
can participate in two-electron reactions to produce aminophenol–quinoneimine
tautomers,43 and dihydroquinoxalines disproportionate
to the oxidized and reduced compounds.44 Thus, the reduction of the quinoxaline ring to 1,4-dihydroquinoxaline
is the form of the thioquinoxalinol sulfate isolated in this study.

Function of Thioquinoxalinol and Its Sulfate Ester
Although it is not possible to report the actual concentrations of
these thioquinoxalinol compounds based on the current data, the derivatized
versions are the major peaks in the total ion chromatogram (Figure 2) and thus these
compounds are likely major compounds with important functions in these
consortia. If their ion intensities are compared to the intensity
of coenzyme F430 in the same sample and it is assumed that
the amount of F430 is the same as reported for methanogens,45 then the combined amounts of the thioquinoxalinol-containing
molecules was ∼36 mM in the original cell pellet. Because the
sensitivity of F430 detection by MS is very high due to
the Ni(III) imparting a single positive charge, it is possible that
the concentrations of the compounds reported here could be even higher.

Thioquinoxalinol and thioquinoxalinol sulfate have all of the hallmarks
of redox carrier coenzymes (Figure 5). The core structure has chemical features comparable
to methanophenzine, a membrane-bound electron carrier in methanogens.18 In the nonsulfated form, thioquinoxalinol could
also undergo reactions analogous to quinones. The presence of the
sulfate ester will make the thioquinoxalinol more water soluble and
the thiol may allow it to transfer electrons thorough thiol groups.
Because one of the nitrogens has an attached methyl group, then it
has the appearance of a pyridine nucleotide with the C-4 being replaced
with a nitrogen (Figure 5). The most intriguing component of the thioquinoxalinol molecules
is the presence of both a redox active quinoxaline ring and thiol
group. All of the known redox active coenzymes have only one redox
center.

Figure 5 Similarities in the chemical structures among the known redox coenzymes
and thioquinoxalinol and its sulfate ester.

An intriguing possible function of the thioquinoxalinol
molecule(s)
in the AOM consortia is to mediate electron transfer between ANME
and SRB (Figure 6A).
As discussed above, thioquinoxalinol likely has a reduction potential
between about −50 to +100 mV based on established properties
of structurally similar redox molecules. This indicates that it could
not serve as a direct electron donor for the SRB partner in AOM consortia
because electrons with potentials of around −250 mV are required.46,47 Interestingly, our proposed structure is very similar to the artificial
electron acceptor, 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, Figure 5). AQDS has a sulfonic
acid in place of a sulfate ester and an anthraquinone ring in place
of the quinoxaline ring. This artificial molecule can be used as an
electron acceptor in AOM consortia where it decouples methane oxidation
from sulfate reduction, indicating that ANME can release electrons
to extracellular electron acceptors to carry out methane oxidation.14 Additionally, Lovley reported in 2002 that some
methanogens can use AQDS as an electron shuttle for Fe(III) reduction.48 This has been confirmed by recent work with Methanosarcina acetivorans.49 Because the expected reduction potential of thioquinoxalinol is
within the range of ferrihydrite,50 it
is possible that these molecules discovered here are involved in Fe(III)
reduction (Figure 6A).

Figure 6 Possible functions of thioquinoxalinol sulfate. (A) Proposed electron
transfer between ANME-1 and SRB assisted by the thioquinoxaline redox
carrier. (B) Possible involvement of the thioquinoxaline redox carrier
in the oxidation of H2S to polysulfides and S8. This process would be involved in the removal toxic hydrogen sulfide.

In the potential roles described above, the thiol
group has no
clear functional requirement. A possible alternative or additional
function is shown in Figure 6B, where the thioquinoxalinol is involved in sulfur metabolism.
Here, hydrogen sulfide reduces the quinoxaline ring and the resulting
sulfane sulfur reacts with the thiol to form a persulfide (−SSH)
which leads to the formation of S8. The production of S8 mediated by thioquinoxalinol sulfate would reduce the amount
of toxic sulfide. This type of biochemistry is comparable to the established
role of flavoproteins in the reduction of disulfides.51 Once reduced, the thioquinoxalinol compound could be involved
in oxygen detoxification. Finally, the identification of sulfated
and nonsulfated thioquinoxalinol implicates a possible role as a sulfate
carrier for delivering sulfate to the SRB.

Final Comments
One must consider that thioquinoxalinol
represents a primitive coenzyme that originally had several redox
functions. Once we have a proven route to its isomerically pure chemical
synthesis, we will explore these functions.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Quinoxalin-6-ol, 4-(benzyloxy)benzene-1,2-diamine
hydrochloride, and mercaptoethylpyrazine was supplied by Enamine,
Monmouth Jct., NJ. Methyl iodide, monobromobimane (mBBr) and α-thioglycerol
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis MO. 4-Phenylbut-3-en-2-one
and dichlorotris(triphenylphosphino)ruthenium(II) were obtained from
Ambeed, Arlington Heights, IL. S-Benzylthioglycerol
was prepared by the reaction of α-thioglycerol with chlorotoluene.
The final product was purified by chromatography on a SiO2 column by elution with a mixture of methylene chloride and methyl
acetate mixtures. The details of the chemical synthesis of the thioquinoxalinol
core structure with an oxidized quinoxaline is described in the Supporting Information and shown in Figure S1.
This synthesis produced the expected four isomers that are shown in Figure S2.

Origin and Cultivation of AOM-Performing Consortia
The thermophilic AOM consortia were cultured from hydrothermal vent
sediments collected from mat-covered sites in the Guaymas Basin, Gulf
of California, Mexico (27.7438° N, 111.409133° W)17 during RV Atlantis cruise AT15-56 in November/December
2009 (Alvin Dive 4570). At the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology,
Bremen, Germany, sediments were diluted with sulfate reducer medium
prepared after Widdel and Bak.52,53 We provided methane
(0.225 MPa CH4 (g)) and sulfate (28 mM SO4–2 (aq)) as sole electron donor and acceptor, respectively,
and carbon dioxide (0.025 MPa CO2; 30 mM dissolved inorganic
carbon) as a carbon source. Samples were incubated at 50 °C and
culture media were exchanged when sulfide concentrations exceeded
∼12 mM and samples were regularly diluted (1:2; 1:4), reaching
sediment-free states after 3 years. To determine the molecular inventory
of the cultures, 450 mL of culture was harvested at about 10 mM sulfide
content. Under anoxic conditions, cells were centrifuged and cell
pellets were immediately frozen. Additionally, fresh and highly sulfidic
incubation media were analyzed. ANME-1 containing cell consortia were
separated from the media and cells, and the spent media were sent
from Germany to the US at −80 °C.

Extraction of Cell Pellets
The extraction procedure
is diagramed in Figure S7 and described
here. The black pellet (0.283 g wet weight) containing the ANME-1/SRB
cells was placed in a sealed tube with 3 mL of 60% methanol in water,
and the sample was heated with shaking for 5 min at 100 °C. This
heating ensured that all proteins were denatured so as to release
all bound cofactors. After cooling, the samples were centrifuged and
the pellets were re-extracted in the same manner a second time. The
resulting red extracts were combined and evaporated to 1 mL with a
stream of nitrogen and large molecules were removed from the sample
using an Amicon Ultra—0.5 mL 3K centrifugal filter. (The red
color of the extracts likely comes from the resazurin added to the
growth media.) After evaporation of the samples to a volume of ∼70
μL, a portion of this sample was assayed directly by UPLC–HR-ESI–MS.

Analysis of Cell Content in the Black Pellet Based on the Amount
of Protein Extracted
A 51.4 mg portion of above black wet
pellet was dried to produce 10.3 mg of a dark gray solid, indicating
that the pellet was 80% water. Extraction of this solid with 100 μL
of 0.5 M NaOH for 5 min at 100 °C released 0.5 mg of protein
(Figure S7). Based on established data
showing that 55% of the dried weight of Escherichia
coli is protein, one can calculate that only ∼1.1
mg of the dried pellet was from cells. Considering that 0.283 g wet
weight of cell pellet was used, then the data reported here were derived
from only 6 mg dry weight of cells. The bulk of the sample has been
identified using Raman spectroscopy as crystals of magnesium phosphate
Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O (bobierrite),
Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O (vivianite),
FeS2, and amorphous carbon.

Formation of Derivatives
The remaining cell extract
was treated with mBBr that converted all thiols into fluorescent thioethers.
The methods for the modification of the thiol groups were developed
following those described by Fahey,54 which
have also been modified for the analysis of sulfite and thiosulfate
in sea water55 and for the identification
of 3-mercaptopropionic acid in methanogens.56 To the concentrated sample, 20 μL of 50 mM TCEP (adjusted
to pH 7 with NaOH), 20 μL of 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 9.3), and
20 μL of 0.1 M solution mBBr in acetonitrile were added. The
TCEP was added to reduce any disulfides formed during aerobic sample
preparation. Samples were then assayed for the presence of thiol-containing
compounds using UPLC–HR-ESI–MS as preciously described.56

After completion of the two assays above,
the remaining sample was reacted with a molybdate-containing catalyst
in the presence of peroxide.57 This reaction
specifically converts molecules containing thioethers into sulfoxides.
This transformation occurred in those molecules where the thiol groups
had been converted into bimane derivatives. In this procedure, 3 μL
of 0.1 M H2O2 and 3 μL of 0.2 μM
of the Mo reagent were added to 40–70 μL of the bimane
derivatized sample with mixing. After 20 min at room temperature,
3 μL of a 0.1 M solution of thiosulfate was added and after
2 or more hours, the sample was assayed by UPLC–HR-ESI–MS.
The sample was then assayed a third time to confirm the presence of
sulfoxides. This was done to further confirm that the original molecule
contained a thiol group.

Chemical Synthesis and Characterization of Model Compounds
Quinoxalin-6-ol was monomethylated at one of the two nitrogens
with methyl iodide (Figure S3). Thus, 5
mg of quinoxalin-6-ol was mixed 100 μL of methyl iodide, 100
μL of methylene chloride, and 100 μL of acetonitrile and
heated at 60 °C for 1 h.58 The resulting
red sample was then evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in water
and purified by preparative TLC using the solvent consisting of 5%
formic acid in acetonitrile. In this solvent system, two major colored
spots with UV absorbance were observed in about equal amounts. The
top TLC spot was yellow and the lower spot was red. These spots were
scraped from the TLC plate eluted with the TLC solvent and their MS
and absorbance spectra obtained. The top yellow band (Rf = 0.61) was same as quinoxalin-6-ol and had the same
UV absorbance spectra (248 nm λmax, 232, and 350
nm in methanol) as the starting material. LC–MS showed a single
peak with (M + H)+ = 147.1. The bottom red band had a Rf = 0.23 and had a λmax = 275
nm in water. A solution of the bottom band in anaerobic 50 mM TES
buffer with 10 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.3 had absorbance peaks
of 275, 335, and 469 nm with the relative intensities of 1.0, 0.10,
and 0.32, respectively. As expected, the TLC-purified lower band showed
two LC–MS peaks both with a M+ = 161.1 resulting
from having one methyl on the nitrogen on the same side as the hydroxyl
group and the other having the methyl group on the opposite side from
the hydroxyl group. We did not try to establish which TLC spot was
which positional isomer. LC–MS spectral data for these compounds
were recorded on an AB Sciex Quadrupole MS interfaced with an Agilent
1200 series LC as previously reported.56

The original quinoxalin-6-ol sample had an absorbance spectrum
that was unchanged in the presence of dithionite, indicating the compound
could not be reduced by dithionite. On the other hand, the lower purified
TLC spot containing the two N-methylated quinoxaline-6-ol isomers
was reduced with dithionite in water. This was confirmed by the loss
of the red color. Shaking the sample in air for a few seconds completely
restored the original spectrum and the red color, indicating that
the methylated quinoxaline ring was redox active. In contract, a solution
of mercaptoethylpyrazine exposed to dithionite showed no reduction.

A sample of the monomethylated quinoxalin-6-ol was mixed with 25
μL of 1 M NaOH, and the sample was heated at 60 °C for
6 h. After the addition of 2 μL of HOAc, the resulting sample
was purified by preparative TLC using 5% HCOOH in CH3CN.
The product with Rf = 0.63 was eluted
from the plate and assayed by UPLC–HR-ESI–MS to show
two peaks with M+ = 177.067 corresponding to C9H9N2O2. These correspond to the
structures shown in Figure S4.

UPLC–HR-ESI–MS Analysis of Samples
Samples
were analyzed on a Waters SYNAPT G2-S high-definition mass spectrometer
connected to a Waters Acquity UPLC I-class system with an Acquity
UPLC BEH C18 (Waters, 2.1 mm × 75 mm, 1.7 μm particle size)
column. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was
100% acetonitrile. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min and gradient elution
was employed in the following manner (t (min), %
B): (0.01, 5), (6, 15), (21, 35), (23, 65). For each analysis, 10
μL of the sample was injected. The mass spectral data were collected
in high-resolution MSe continuum mode. A lock spray scan (function
3) was collected every 20 s for calibration, and the lock spray analyte
used was leucine-enkephalin. Parameters were 2.8 kV capillary voltage,
125 °C source temperature, 350 °C desolvation temperature,
35 V sampling cone, 50 L/h cone gas flow, 500 L/h desolvation gas
flow, and 6 L/h nebulizer gas flow. The collision energies for the
low-energy scans (function 1) were 4 and 2 V in the trap region and
the transfer region, respectively. Collision energies for the high-energy
scans (function 2) were ramped from 25 to 45 V in the trap region
and 2 V in the transfer region. Data were analyzed using MassLynx
program (Waters). The extracted ion chromatograms for the molecules
in Figure 1 are shown
in Figure 2.

hazards were encountered.
