==== Body
“What is the Impact Factor of ACS
Omega?” This is a question that we, editors of ACS Omega, frequently encounter during our travels to conferences
around the
world. This question arises even though our Journal Scope states:
“ACS Omega is an open-access global publication
for scientific articles that describe new findings in chemistry and
interfacing areas of science, without any perceived evaluation of
immediate impact.”

As we mentioned in our previous Editorial,1 in 2018 ACS Omega advanced from
Clarivate Analytics’
Web of Science Emerging Sources Citation Index to the main Science
Citation Index Expanded database. As a result, the journal received
its inaugural Impact Factor in June 2019. After fielding this question
innumerable times since our journal launch, we can finally answer
this question for researchers. The inaugural Impact
Factor of ACS Omega is 2.584. In mentioning this,
it should be noted that the journal started publishing articles in
July 2016, and therefore, this value does not include the full two-year
cycle of published content nor the full time frame (up to two full
years) to earn citations. Thus, the window for the Impact Factor is
smaller, and consequently, the value received is lower than a full
two-year Impact Factor. We anticipate, based on broad experience with
other journals launching midyear, that the Impact Factor released
in the summer of 2020 will increase.

But, let us look beyond
this single metric, whose pros and cons
are well documented,2,3 to the many ways in which we can
already measure the impact (not only the Impact Factor) of ACS Omega. ACS Omega has attracted a truly
global authorship (Figure 1), with 4,250 peer-reviewed articles published since launch
(data range July 2016–May 2019) by corresponding authors from
71 different countries already earning 8,320 citations (Clarivate
Web of Science, accessed June 24th, 2019). Displayed in Table 1 are the top 10 most cited articles.
Articles published in ACS Omega have cumulatively
been viewed and downloaded nearly 3 million times by interested readers
from around the world (Figure 2). In keeping with our open-access mission, this readership
profile is made up of an approximately 50%/50% split between ACS institutional
subscribers and nonsubscribers. Additionally, articles published in ACS Omega have been mentioned over 5,500 times on social
media, including more than 400 mentions in various news Web sites
and blogs. Our Twitter (https://twitter.com/ACS_Omega) demographics have spanned 80
countries with close to 3,000 unique tweeters sharing content from
our journal. Here, we share a selection of articles that grabbed attention
on social media (Table 2). As always, we are grateful to all of our authors, reviewers, editorial
board members, and readers who have helped make ACS Omega an impactful journal by all these metrics. This is just the beginning
of our journey, and we are confident that the influence of our nascent
journal will continue to grow.

In closing,
we would like to provide a few updates on ACS
Omega of interest to our authors and readers.

•As
promised in our previous Editorial,1 we
initiated various strategies and workflows to handle
the growing number of submissions and to accelerate our processing
times. As a result, there has been a marked improvement in our processing
times in 2019, with median submission to first decision times now
at 22 days and submission to acceptance now at 53 days (down from
62 days in 2018). We continue to strive to provide a truly valuable
author experience, ensuring that articles are handled as expeditiously
as possible, maintaining our journal’s uncompromising hallmarks
of high-quality peer review and careful editorial decision making.

•By popular demand, we have introduced a new manuscript
type called “Mini-Reviews”, short accounts of rapidly
emerging areas, techniques, or processes, in cross-disciplinary research
domains. We encourage interested authors to read the detailed submission
guidelines for this new manuscript type at https://pubsapp.acs.org/paragonplus/submission/acsodf/acsodf_authguide.pdf and contact the Managing Editors at managing.editor@omega.acs.org with any presubmission inquiries.

•Finally, we sincerely
thank Prof. Dean Tantillo, one of
our inaugural Associate Editors, for his outstanding service to our
journal as he bids the team farewell at the end of June 2019 and welcome
our newest Associate Editors who joined the team in the second quarter
of 2019: Prof. Sarbajit Banerjee (Texas A&M University, USA) and
Prof. Jeehiun Lee (Rutgers University, USA). With these editorial
changes, the composition of our board remains topically and geographically
diverse, with four editors based in Europe, three in China, two in
India and the USA, and one in each Brazil and Japan. Maintaining diversity
remains at the heart of ACS Omega’s mission
in serving our global authorship and enhancing our global impact.
