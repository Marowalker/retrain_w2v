A convergent and
stereoselective approach for the synthesis of
marine natural product (MNP) phormidolide D (PM D) is proposed. Two
main disconnections divided PM D in three molecular fragments: the
macrocyclic core 4, the stapling iodoalkene 9 corresponding to the central part of PMs, and the east fragment 5 that includes the unusual bromo-methoxy-diene moiety and
a tetradecanoic acid ended with a (E)-dichloro-ene
functionality. Procedures for the preparation of compounds 5, 9, and the never-reported fatty acids 7 and 8, present in PMs C and D, respectively, have been
afforded with good yields and high degree of stereoselectivity. The
absolute configuration of all of the generated stereocenters has been
established. The reaction to link iodoalkene 9 and formylmacrolactone 4, using the Nozaki–Hiyama–Takai–Kishi
coupling, gave an advanced synthetic intermediate with total stereocontrol.
Finally, a deeper study of protecting groups and reaction conditions
for the last step of the synthesis is needed. All the information
gathered in this publication will be of great value to continue performing
synthetic studies for the preparation of these NPs. The versatility
and the presence of a common polyol chain in oscillariolide and PMs
A–C would allow applying the same retrosynthesis for the synthesis
of the mentioned MNP.

==== Body
Introduction
Polyketides, and more
specifically macrolides, represent a family
of marine natural products (MNPs) of great interest from a biological-therapeutical
point of view,1 but at the same time, they
show high complex molecular architectures that make their syntheses
a real challenge. Phormidolides C and D (Scheme 1, PMs C and D, 1–2) are
marine polyketides isolated by the biotech company PharmaMar that showed cytotoxic activity in three tumor cell lines with an
unknown mechanism of action.2 From a structural
point of view, PMs C and D present 13 stereocenters and 5 di- and
trisubstituted double bonds distributed in the following moieties:
a tetrahydrofuran (THF)-containing macrolide (C1–C14), a polyhydroxylated
chain (C15–C31) terminated with a unusual bromo-metoxy-diene
moiety, and two different tetradecanoic fatty acids (C39–C52)
containing a terminal (E)-dichloro-ene or (E)-bomo-chloro-ene functionalities linked to the C27 hydroxylic
position.a So far, and to the best of our knowledge,
no total synthesis of PMs C and D or the related PM A3 and oscillariolide4 has been
described.

Scheme 1 (a) First Retrosynthetic Analysis for the Preparation
of PMs C and
D and (b) Second-Generation Retrosynthesis Described in This Publication
The structural and stereochemical
elucidation of PMs C and D were
carried out through mono- and bidimensional advanced NMR techniques
(1H, 13C, 1D-TOCSY, gCOSY, gHSQC, and gHMBC)
and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS).b The relative configuration of stereocenters present in the macrocyclic
core was determined using rotational nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy
combined with the J-based configuration analysis and nuclear Overhauser
effect experiments. The two only stereocenters, with unclear configuration
after the NMR analysis, were C3 and C14 positions. To solve this issue,
our group reported the chemical syntheses of three different diastereomeric
protected macrocyclic cores (C1–C15 fragment). NMR comparison
of the synthetic and natural products suggested to us that the 3R,14R
configuration was the most plausible one.2 A second-generation synthesis of the C1–C15 moiety with the
mentioned stereochemistry, after the removal of the protecting groups,
enabled a second NMR comparison with the NP which showed high similarity,
hence confirming our 3R and 14R stereochemical hypothesis.5

Stereochemistry of the C15–C31 fragment,
common to oscillariolide4 and PM A,3 was determined
by the chemical shift and the coupling constant in comparison with
PM A, whose absolute configuration was previously determined by Gerwick
and co-workers. Recently, our group described the synthesis of the
C19–C31 polyhydroxylated chain,6 including the tricky bromo-methoxy-diene motif.7 This allowed a new NMR chemical shift comparison between
the synthetic and NPs showing high degree of similarity, thereby confirming
the absolute configuration of the polyol chain by chemical synthesis.

Our initial proposed retrosynthesis (Scheme 1, a) explained during the enantioselective
synthesis of the polyhydroxylated chain was based on a single disconnection
through the C15–C16 bond.6 Both
fragments 3 and 4 would be linked in the
last step of the synthesis through a Nozaki–Hiyama–Takai–Kishi8 (NHTK) coupling reaction. However, this approach
posed some clear disadvantages. First, a high number of linear synthetic
steps for the preparation of 3 would be required, and
the introduction of the C16 iodoalkene functionality would not be
trivial. Second, a possible lack of chemoselectivity in the formation
of C15–C16 bond using NHTK conditions could have occurred because
of the presence of other reactive positions in 3 such
as C31 or C52. For these reasons, a new retrosynthetic analysis that
overcame all the above-mentioned problems was necessary.

The
new synthetic approach (Scheme 1, b) envisions a disconnection through the C22–C23
bond to create it at the end of the route through a previously optimized6 Mukaiyama aldol addition from aldehyde 5 (C23–C31) and methyl ketone 6 (C1–C22).
Fatty acids 7 and 8 present in different
PMs would be synthesized separately and esterified at the C27 position
during the synthetic route toward 5. Then, fragment 6 would be planned to be prepared by means of the NHTK8 coupling of enantiopure iodoalkene 9 (C16–C22) and the previously reported C1–C15 fragment
aldehyde 4.5 A reliable preparation
of central fragment 9 is crucial because of its useful
bivalent nature (methyl ketone and iodoalkene) that allows its use
as a “stapling” compound between macrocycle 4 and aldehyde 5.

Herein, we report the preparation
of fatty acids 7 and 8, present on both
PMs C and D, and the synthesis
of aldehyde 5 and iodoalkene 9. Furthermore,
with fragments 5, 9, and 4 in
hand, the first synthetic approach for the synthesis of MNP PM D (PM
D) is discussed.

Results and Discussion
Fatty Acids Preparation
Tetradecanoic acids containing
(E)-dihalogenated terminal double bonds were prepared by direct dihalogenation
of the corresponding terminal alkyne using the methodology developed
by Negoro and Ikeda.9 The use of these
halogenation conditions had important advantages such as good yields,
easy experimental setup, mild conditions, stereospecificity toward
the (E) double bond, and regioselectivity for the desired isomer in
the case of bromochlorination.

The synthetic route was initially
started using commercially available 11-bromo-1-dodecanol 10 through the protection of the hydroxyl prior to the alkyne introduction
and through triple bond halogenation. The tetrahydropyranyl (THP)
protecting group was chosen as the most convenient protecting group
for the whole synthetic route.c After the THP
protection of 10 and acetylide introduction, alkyne 11 was obtained in high yield. This compound is common to
both synthetic routes for the preparation of fatty acids 7 and 8 (Scheme 2). The key reaction of 11 with tetrabutylammonium
dichlorobromide (TBADCB) in CH2Cl2 at room temperature
(rt) produced terminal alkene 12 as a single (E) double-bond
isomer. (E) Stereochemistry was obtained due to the reaction mechanism.9 However, compound 12 was obtained
as an 89:11 mixture of inseparable regioisomers.d The THP removal followed by a double Dess–Martin and Pinnick
oxidation rendered fatty acid 7 found in PM C. Finally, 7 was protected as a methyl ester and purified to obtain 14 in good yield with a single final purification from 11. It is important to mention that this final protection
was performed to facilitate the purification process and to enhance
the stability of the compound for long-term storage.

Scheme 2 Preparation
of the Fatty Acids Present in PMs C and D
Reagents
and conditions: (a)
PPTS, CH2Cl2, 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran, rt, 95%; (b) lithium acetylide–diethylamine complex,
DMSO, rt, 99%; (c) TBADCB, CH2Cl2, rt; (d) tetrabutylammonium
trichloride, CH2Cl2, rt; (e) p-TsOH, MeOH, rt; (f) DMP, CH2Cl2, rt; (g) NaClO2, NaH2PO4, 2-methyl-2-butene, tBuOH/H2O, rt; and (h) TMSCHN2, CH2Cl2, MeOH. Yields: 14 = 20% from 11; 15 = 12% from 11.

A similar synthetic route was followed for the preparation of 8, using tetrabutylammonium trichloride for the halogenation
of 11. This salt was prepared by the reaction of tetrabutylammonium
chloride with in situ generated chlorine.10 Protected alkene 13 was obtained as a single stereoisomer
and then, a deprotection–oxidation sequence similar to that
used for 7 delivered fatty acid 8. Finally,
methyl ester protection and purification produced ester 15. These two simple synthetic routes allowed an easy, efficient, and
scalable preparation of the fatty acids present in PMs C and D.

Preparation of Fragment C23–C31 (5)
With both fatty acids in hand, the challenging preparation of aldehyde 5, the east end of the molecule, was investigated. The route
was started from the previously reported alcohol 16 (Scheme 3).6 t-Butyldimethylsilyl (TBS)-hydroxyl protection, DIBAL-H
regioselective ketal reduction,11 and Swern
oxidation afforded aldehyde 17 with good synthetic yields
at the gram scale. Then, the Mukaiyama aldol addition of (E)-((4-bromo-3-methoxybuta-1,3-dien-2-yl)oxy)trimethylsilane(6) produced ketol 18 as an
inseparable mixture of diastereomers (82:18) enriched in the undesired
C27-(S) isomer.e Then, as it happened in our
previous work,6 a three-step procedure
was necessary to introduce the methylidene moiety including triethylsilane
(TES) protection of 18, olefination using the Tebbe reagent
and TES pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (PPTS)-mediated
removal to afford homoallylic alcohol 19 in good yield.
At this point, C27-diastereomers were separated by column chromatography
and the absolute configuration of the major isomer was confirmed using
Mosher’s derivatization.12f Mitsunobu hydroxyl inversion13 of 19, followed by basic hydrolysis of the
generated nitrobenzoate, cleanly delivered the C27-(S) isomer compound 20. Then, alcohol 20 was esterified with (E)-13,14-dichlorotetradec-13-enoic acid (8)
to obtain the protected C23–C31 fragment of PM D, ester 21. tert-Butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) removal
at position C23 and Dess–Martin oxidation gave us access to
aldehyde 5 in 12 steps with useful yields from alcohol 16.

77%; and (m) DMP, NaHCO3, CH2Cl2,
93%.

Preparation of Fragment C16–C22 (9)
The synthesis of the central bifunctionalized
C16–C22 fragment 9 (Scheme 4) began with the aldol addition of silylenolether 22(14) to aldehyde 23(15) to obtain ketol 24 as
a C19 epimeric
mixture. Several reported enantioselective strategies using N-Ts-l-valine or a tryptophan-derived oxazaborolidine
as chiral inductors for this addition were tested unsuccessfully.16,17 The racemic mixture 24 was reacted with the chiral
(R)-methoxyphenylacetic acid (MPA) to obtain the
corresponding diastereomeric esters that were easily separated via
column chromatography to isolate the desired C19-R epimer 25-R,R and its diastereomer 25-S,R. Taking advantage of the
fact that 25-S,R is the enantiomer of 25-R,S, and therefore spectroscopically identical; it was possible to identify 25-R,R without additional derivatizations using Mosher’s
model.18f

Scheme 4 Preparation
of Compound 9, Fragment C16–C22
Reagents and conditions: (a)
BF3·Et2O, CH2Cl2,
63%; (b) (R)-MPA, EDC·HCl, DMAP, THF; (c) column
chromatography to isolate C19 diastereomers 25-R,R, 41%
and 25-S,R, 42%; (d) TMSOTf, 1,2-bis(trimethylsiloxy)ethane,
−78 °C to rt, 97%, (e) LiOH·H2O, MeOH,
65 °C, 92%; (f) TBSOTf, Et3N, CH2Cl2, 74%; and (g) PPTS, MeOH, quant.

Ester basic hydrolysis at this point was nonviable probably because
of methyl ketone known basic media instability; therefore, C21 position
had to be protected. Mild protecting conditions20 to install the ketone 1,3-dioxolane protecting group were
used and subsequent LiOH-mediated ester saponification rendered alcohol 26 in high yield for this two-step transformation. Finally,
alcohol protection using TBSOTf and ketal removal to recover the methyl
ketone delivered the desired iodoalkene 9 as a single
(R) enantiomer, as needed.

Endgame of the Synthesis
Having
synthesized fragments 5, 9, and 4,5 the pieces of the synthetic puzzle
should be put together. First
of all, the union of aldehyde 4 and iodoalkene 9 using the CrCl2–NiCl2-mediated
NHTK coupling (Scheme 5, a) was attempted.8,21 This methodology allowed the
selective formation of the C15–C16 bond in the presence of
methyl ketone because of the well-known chemoselectivity of NHTK coupling
toward aldehydes, thereby demonstrating the useful orthogonal reactivity
of compound 9. Unfortunately, the reaction between 9 and 4 gave stereoselectively compound 6 possessing the configuration R-C15 with only 18% yield.8

Scheme 5 (a) NHTK Coupling To Obtain Alcohol 6, the C1–C21
Fragment and (b) Determination of C15 Absolute configuration Using
VT Mosher Methodology19
Reagents and conditions: (a)
CrCl2, NiCl2, DMF, 48 h, 18% and (b) (R)-MPA, EDC·HCl, DMAP, THF, 48 h.

Because of the low amount of compound 6 available,
it was decided to use the variable temperature (VT) Mosher determination
that allows assigning the absolute configuration of a secondary alcohol
performing a single derivatization.19 First,
alcohol 6 was converted into its corresponding (R)-methoxyphenylacetic ester 27. Then, 1H NMR of compound 27 in CD2Cl2 was recorded at 25 and −60 °C, and the C15-(R)
configuration was confirmed by calculating the increment in chemical
shift (Scheme 5, below).g

When the synthetic route was planned, the
formation of the C22–C23
bond was envisioned as its last step based on our previous outstanding
results on the formation of this bond while working in the synthesis
of the polyhydroxylated chain. As depicted in Scheme 6a, the Mukaiyama addition of silylenolether 29(22) to aldehyde 28 gave not only almost quantitative yield but also total stereoselectivity
toward the desired C23-(R) diastereomer 30.6 Bearing this precedent in mind, methyl ketone
and the hydroxyl present in compound 6 were simultaneously
transformed into the corresponding silylenolether and protected hydroxyl
in quantitative yield to render the nucleophile for the final Mukaiyama
addition, compound 31 (Scheme 6, b). However, when the Mukaiyama addition
of silylenolether 31 to aldehyde 5 (using
the same conditions applied for the preparation of 30) was performed,6 no conversion toward
the product took place, recovering both starting materials after column
purification. Modification of the reaction conditions by increasing
the equivalents of BF3·Et2O and the temperature
to 0 °C resulted in no reaction either. After these negative
results, it was concluded that the formation of the C22–C23
bond using the Mukaiyama methodology with the coupling partners 5 and 31 was not possible in this case.

Scheme 6 (a) Precedent
Work in the Formation of the C22–C23 Bond and
(b) Endgame of the Total Synthesis
Regents
and conditions: (a) BF3·Et2O, −78
°C, CH2Cl2 (5% Et2O), 2 h, 98%, dr = 98:2; (b) TMSOTf, Et3N, DMAP, CH2Cl2, rt, 4 h, quant.; and (c) BF3·Et2O, −78
°C, CH2Cl2 (5% Et2O), 2 h, no
reaction.

The reason for this lack of reactivity
is unknown, but by comparison
with our reported precedents, it can be hypothesized that steric congestion
around carbons C22 and C23 hinders reagents approximation. The presence
of a tetradecanoic ester (C27) and p-methoxybenzyl
(PMB) (C25) in aldehyde 5 reduces somehow the necessary
carbonyl activation by BF3·Et2O. In addition,
a secondary TBSO-protected hydroxyl (C19) in the large functionalized
compound 31 could suppress its reactivity as a nucleophile.

Conclusions
Highly convergent strategies are the process
of choice for the
total synthesis of large NPs such as PM D. The synthetic approach
reported herein is composed of a total of 73 reactions, but the longest
synthetic sequence to achieve PM D is only 20 steps long (the preparation
of 5 from the commercially available starting material
plus Mukaiyama addition and C21 reduction). The use of highly convergent
strategies normally relies on final complex reactions because large
molecular entities have to be efficient and stereoselectively linked.

In summary, this publication reports a highly convergent approach
toward the NP PM D. A robust and scalable synthesis of fatty acids 7 and 8, present in PMs C and D, using a stereoselective
and regioselective halogenation of acetylene to obtain (E)-dihalogenated
terminal double bonds with high yield under mild conditions is described.
Stereoselective efficient strategies for the preparation of 5 (C23–C31 fragment) and 9 (C16–C22
fragment) are fully described setting up the conditions to achieve
total synthesis. A notable NHTK coupling of macrocyclic fragment 4 and iodoalkene 9 was performed in useful yield
and with total substrate-controlled diastereoselectivity.

Finally,
the last C22–C23 bond formation using the Mukaiyama
methodology to link aldehyde 5 and silylenolether 31 did not work despite our previous encouraging results with
smaller molecules. These adverse results do not invalidate the proposed
retrosynthetic strategy that probably could give good results using
less hindered protecting groups. Therefore, a revision of the protecting
groups in positions C19 and C25 should be carried out before embarking
on the synthesis of these complex NPs. Consequently, all the information
reported in this publication will be of great value in the development
of the total synthesis of MNPs PMs B–D.
