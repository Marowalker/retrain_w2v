Saposin B (SapB)
is a human lysosomal protein, critical for the
degradation of O-sulfogalactosylceramide (sulfatide).
SapB binds sulfatide and presents it to the active site of the enzyme
arylsulfatase A. Deficiency of SapB leads to fatal activator-deficient
metachromatic leukodystrophy. Given the conformational flexibility
and the large hydrophobic “pocket” produced upon (physiologically
relevant) homodimerization, SapB may have broader substrate diversity
than originally thought. Herein, we present evidence using fluorescence
spectroscopy and computational docking studies that SapB binds a wide
variety of ligands at KD values varying
from micromolar to nanomolar, with entropy being the primary driving
force. We further demonstrate, for the first time, that SapB has two
binding sites that can sequentially (and in a preferred order) accommodate
up to two ligands at once.

1 Introduction
Saposin
B (SapB) is an intralysosomal, heat-stable human glycoprotein
that functions as a nonenzymatic cofactor in the degradation of O-sulfogalactosylceramide (sulfatide) by presenting the
lipid to the active site of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ASA).1,2 SapB was the first of four saposins to be discovered and is a product
of the post-translational cleavage of prosaposin, along with SapA,
SapC, and SapD.1 All four saposins are
nonenzymatic.1,2 SapB has been extensively investigated
due to its role in the lethal lysosomal storage disease activator-deficient
metachromatic leukodystrophy (AD-MLD), the result of a buildup of
sulfatides in the lysosome.1,3 SapB favors a dimeric
structure, has a variable degree of α-helical character across
pH ranges (∼53% at ∼lysosomal pH pf 5; ∼68% at
pH 7.0), three disulfide bonds, and a hydrophobic binding pocket,
consistent with its role in lipid binding.1,2,4,5

Previous
work has almost exclusively focused on SapB interaction
with lipids, lipidlike molecules, and ASA. Recently, our group and
others have shown that SapB can bind ligands beyond sulfatide. It
has been shown that SapB binds coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and serves as a binding and transfer protein for the coenzyme,
with [SapB-CoQ10]complex being detected in human urine.6,7 It has also been shown that SapB binds the lysosomotropic antimalarial
drugs atovaquone6 (ATO) and chloroquine5 (CQ), as well as the bisretinoid N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine8 (A2E), which accumulates in the lysosome of patients with
macular degeneration.9−11

The critical importance of SapB as a lysosomal
activator and transporter
protein and its multiligand binding characteristics beyond sulfatide
degradation raise important questions about the driving forces and
factors that influence such a wide range of ligand interactions. Herein,
we present evidence using fluorescence spectroscopy and computational
docking studies, supported by our prior work using isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC)5,6 and protein crystallography,5 that SapB binds a wide variety of ligands with KD values ranging from micromolar to nanomolar
(see Scheme 1 and Figure 1). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a ligand’s calculated partition coefficient
(c Log P) can be used
to predict binding affinity with SapB and that SapB-ligand binding
is driven principally by entropic factors. We hypothesize that deviation
from this general binding model, as in the case of the [SapB-ATO]complex, is likely due to the presence of a second and strong
binding site for ATO (and perhaps for other ligands as well) on the
surface of the protein. Such superficial binding is shown to block
access of other ligands to the deeper binding pocket inside SapB.

pH 5.5 with 2 μL injections of 2 mM ligand (only HCQ was dissolved
in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 5.5; all other ligands were prepared
in 100% dimethylformamide (DMF)), conducted at room temperature. Because
of HCQ’s own fluorescence emission of around 360 nm, minimal
fluorescence quenching was observed upon HCQ binding to SapB. The
data was analyzed using the double logarithmic Stern–Volmer
equation, as previously described.5,8 SapB was prepared
and structurally validated, as previously described.12

2 Results and Discussion
The interaction of SapB, prepared as previously described,12 with a variety of ligands was followed by monitoring
the quenching of the fluorescence intensities of the protein’s
tyrosine residues8 upon binding (Figure 1a–f). An excitation
wavelength of 278 nm was used and the fluorescence emission was monitored
between 285 and 500 nm.

For each ligand tested, the quenching
of the protein’s fluorescence
intensity was monitored at the maximum emission wavelength of 330
nm (see Figure 1) and
the data was analyzed using double logarithmic Stern–Volmer
plots5,8,13 (Supporting eq 1 and Supporting Figure 1a–f). The log of the binding affinity (KA) for each ligand is reported in Table 1 and shows a general increase
in the KA value as the ligand hydrophobicity
increases, consistent with the known primary function of SapB as a
binder and extractor of lipids within the lysosome. Interestingly,
a plot of Log KA versus c Log P (Figure 2) shows a strong correlation
(i.e., R2 > 0.9) and a clear linear
trend
of all ligands tested with the exception of [SapB-ATO]complex, suggesting that [SapB-Ligand]complex formation is primarily
driven by entropy. To support this idea, we measured the thermodynamic
binding parameters ΔS° and ΔH° for six of the bound substrates shown in Scheme 1 (see Table 2). As can be observed, with
the exception of ATO, the binding interactions are both enthalpically
and entropically favored, although the entropic contributions are
much more pronounced (i.e., −20.6 kJ mol–1 < −TΔS < −47.9
kJ mol–1 vs −1.8 kJ mol–1 < ΔH < −8.6 kJ mol–1) than their enthalpic counterparts. Notably, the strongest entropy
of binding observed for ATO, postulated to bind at an alternate “second”
binding site, offers further insights into the deviation from the
Log KA versus c Log P plot linearity, as mentioned
earlier (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Plot of Log KA against ligands’
calculated c Log P for several ligands binding to SapB at pH 5.5. Each fluorescence
quenching experiment was performed in triplicate with each point on
the plot representing the average of three runs. The data was fitted
using a linear least squares regression, excluding the data point
for ATO. The slope and intercept of the best-fit line (R2 = 0.934) are 0.191 and 3.28, with standard errors of
0.017 and 0.190, respectively. The shaded area denotes the upper and
lower 95% confidence intervals.

The previously published crystal structures of SapB4 and [SapB-CQ]complex5 show a v-shaped, hydrophobic pocket for SapB suitable for
lipid
and/or small molecules binding. However, NMR solution structure studies19 of SapB have proven challenging, with molecular
dynamics modeling revealing20 an inherently
flexible SapB dimer, with at least three separate conformations postulated.
Additional work has shown that this dimeric flexibility might play
a role in overall SapB function because mutants with more rigidity
have led to a decline in function.4 This
suggests that a mechanism underlying the broad binding specificity
of SapB reported herein, and its ability to bind a variety of hydrophobic
molecules, is likely due to the inherent conformational flexibility
of the protein.19,20

To probe the adaptability
of the pocket and its ability to accept
multiple ligands, we conducted “order of addition” fluorescence
binding experiments using preformed [SapB-Ligand]complexes, followed by direct titrations of a second ligand (ligand = ATO
or A2E; see Scheme 1c, 1e, respectively). Titration of A2E into
a preformed solution of [SapB-ATO]complex resulted in no
A2E binding compared to SapB binding of A2E alone, as a control (Supporting Figure 4, green and black curves,
respectively). This lack of A2E binding indicates a blocking effect
for ATO consistent with the computational docking studies21−23 shown in Figure 3a, suggesting that ATO is more surface bound than “buried”
inside the SapB hydrophobic pocket. However, titration of ATO into
a preformed [SapB-A2E]complex solution resulted in a clear
binding of ATO to SapB (see Supporting Figure 5). The inability of the SapB dimer to accommodate two ATO
molecules at the same time is due to the surface-bound nature of the
ATO molecule and the subsequent asymmetric structure of the SapB dimer
(Figure 3a). These
observations are in agreement with a recent ITC study suggesting one
ATO molecule binds per SapB dimer.6 On
the contrary, SapB dimer is able to initially bind one A2E molecule
followed by another molecule of ATO (Figure 3b and Supporting Figure 5) presumably because A2E binds into a deeper pocket buried
inside the hydrophobic cavity of the SapB dimer.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate
that (a) SapB binds a broad range
of ligands, (b) such binding is primarily driven by entropic forces,
and (c) can be predicted from the log KA versus ligand’s c Log P plot, and (d) that SapB can accommodate certain ligands
in a specific and sequential order. Such a preferred order of binding
is likely due to the large hydrophobic pocket produced upon the homodimerization
and conformational flexibility of SapB as previously described.20

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Saposin B (SapB)
was prepared and purified according to literature reports.12 All SapB solutions in this study were prepared
in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. Protein concentration was determined
spectrophotometrically using a molar absorptivity value of 2950 M–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. Ligand solutions
were prepared in 100% dimethylformamide (DMF) to a concentration of
2 mM, with the exception of hydoxychloroquine (HCQ), which was prepared
in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. The concentrations of all the ligands
were determined via ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy using
molar absorptivity values of: 36 900 M–1 cm–1 at 440 nm for A2E; 7500 M–1 cm–1 at 331 nm for CQ; 226.9 M–1 cm–1 at 329 for HCQ; 27 300 M–1 cm–1 at 253 nm for ATO; 22 540 M–1 cm–1 at 279 nm for PEth; 27 500 M–1 cm–1 at 280 nm for PCho; 4150 M–1 cm–1 at 283 for CoQ4; and 3750 M–1 cm–1 at 282 nm for CoQ9.

4.2 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence
quenching measurements were performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter
equipped with a QNW Peltier temperature controller. The binding experiments
were conducted at 25.00 ± 0.01 °C in 50 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 5.5, using 278 nm excitation wavelength for SapB emission spectra
at 330 nm (Figure 1a–f) with excitation and emission monochromators bandwidth
of 5 nm each. Temperature sensitive binding experiments were performed
between 20.00 ± 0.01 and 40.00 ± 0.01 °C using 278
nm excitation wavelength for SapB emission spectra at 331 nm, with
excitation and emission monochromators bandwidth of 5 nm each. The
fluorescence quenching data were analyzed using OriginLab software
version 8.

4.3 Docking Studies
Studies were performed
with SwissDock using the structure of SapB-CQ (PDB 4V2O) as a model. The
orientation of the ATO ligand was checked manually using Coot and
optimized for putative hydrogen bonding interactions.21−23
