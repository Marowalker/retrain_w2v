A simple approach of template growth
of graphitic-carbon nitride (g-CN), a polymeric unit consisting of
C, N, O, and H elements derived from extracts of green plant Aloe vera, which are rich in several chemical constituents,
has been successfully experimented in this work. Comparing several
other methods used for synthesizing g-CN involving a large amount
of toxic components, here, we propose the simplest route economically
and environmentally highly viable for near future. Green plants are
highly rich in natural carbon and nitrogen compounds, such as acemannan,
glucose, aloin, protein, etc. Way before g-CN research, many carbon-based
materials have been synthesized for multifunctional properties, but
g-CN has much benefit over them due to the presence of elements such
as C, N, O, and H, thus making it electron-rich. Multifunctional properties
of graphitic-carbon nitride interface bonding as a supercapacitor
or as a metal-free catalyst thus help degrade dyes. Violet-blue broad
band emission was even noticed when excited at 240 nm via C–C
bonding (π–π* transition) in the absorption band
with an extinction coefficient of ∼104 M–1 cm–1. With our research, we want to pave new ways
of synthesizing such materials present in our nature in a biological
form, which can protect our environment, thus causing less harm to
mankind.

1 Introduction
An
insatiable demand for energy by humans has to be soon satisfied by
replacing it with other ways of harvesting energy. Problems related
to the shortage of energy and environmental decay are paving way for
considering strategies to utilize solar energy resources efficiently
and effectively.1 In the last few decades,
several inorganic materials as a catalytic material for dye degradation
and hydrogen production from water under light irradiation have been
synthesized using various techniques. Such materials are metal species
used for energy conversion produced chemically.2−4 Like TiO2-based materials for photocatalysts, which have been modified
by incorporating several other materials such as gold and carbon nitride,
which increase the surface area, leading to an increase in adsorption
due to enhanced active sites on the surface of the TiO2.5,6 For devising
metal-free materials with such applications, attention was made toward
graphitic carbon nitride, a new catalyst that is metal-free with a
suitable band gap for the wide optical regime, having unique optical,
electronic, photocatalytic, and other properties. Graphitic carbon
nitride is a polymeric semiconductor mainly composed of C, O, and
N, which is generally environmentally friendly and, due to covalent
C–N bonds, is highly stable both thermally (up to 600 °C)
and chemically.7 Several investigations
have been done from nonporous to mesoporous and 2D- to 1D-type graphitic
carbon nitride that can help increase and modulate the photocatalytic
properties.8,9 Unfortunately, as-prepared graphitic carbon
nitride has low photocatalytic efficiency due to a low surface area
and low e––h+ carrier generation
when light is irradiated upon it.10 To
overcome this issue, several methods were developed to design the
nanoarchitecture of bare graphitic carbon nitride with soft and hard
template approaches, functionalizing them at an atomic level and modifying
them electronically at energy levels.11 One way to overcome these issues is novel biosynthetic routes that
are explored using green plant extracts that are even environmentally
friendly.12−16 In Table 1, we have
compared the bioroute (using Aloe vera gel)-synthesized graphitic carbon nitride with the literature (research
done in the last 2–3 years). These methods help in controlling the growth of crystal and its
morphology. Aloe vera is a widely used
plant for its medicinal value consisting of phytochemicals such as
acemannan, aloin, protein, glucose, etc. Aloe vera and such other green plants have low cost and are easily available
as a substitution to hazardous (toxic) chemicals.17

Owing to the recent demands of 2D (two-dimensional)
nanosheets due to its special optical, electrical, catalytic, and
sensing properties, it has become an emerging field. Graphene is one
of the well-known carbon sheets that have good chemical and thermal
stability and good electronic properties and provide a larger surface
area. It usually consists of an atomic-layer-thick planar sheet consisting
of a sp2-bonded carbon layer.18−24 Analogous to graphene is graphene oxide having C–O moieties
obtained by chemical treatment of graphite, either dissolving in water
or other organic/inorganic solvents. The attachment of oxygen to carbon
is via functional groups that are exhibited at the edge or basal planes
of the graphene sheet.25 These functional
groups help in the interaction of other materials with graphene sheet
by charge transfer-tuning its electronic, catalytic, and optical properties.
In recent years, the study of graphene oxide-based nanomaterials has
become popular, particularly in the field of electrochemical applications.26 The importance of such nanomaterials in this
field is relevant as compared to graphene due to its better results.27 Reducing graphitic carbon nitride to graphene
oxide by simply washing it using organic solvents such as acetone
was even demonstrated in our research. Here, we propose a facile method
of biogenic synthesis by simply burning the Aloe vera extract using camphor (green fuel agent) in a vacuum condition.
Thus, the obtained pristine powder was annealed at 600 °C in
a vacuum furnace to remove excess amorphous carbon. This method is
promisingly more effective in a large-scale for next-generation nanotechnology
and materials revolution. Further, the powders were analyzed using
XRD, FTIR, Raman, SEM, and TEM and then employed to study various
properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Model
Reactions and Growth of Formation of Small g-C2N Template
As shown in Scheme 1a, Aloe vera leaves have unique toxicological
and biological properties since our history of usage in cosmetics;
wound/burn healing promoters; anti-inflammatory, antiprotozoal, and
ultraviolet radiation protectors; and several others.11Aloe vera gel contains various
constituents such as glucose, protein, acemannan, amino acid, aloin,
etc. having C, O, N, and H elements. It mainly contains two parts,
flesh and gel; the inner gel can be taken out by simply peeling the
outer surface and etching the gel inside the green leaves, releasing
nectar having a major product: a gel dispersed in an ample amount
of water (≥98 wt %) of a light green liquid. The nectar was
then cleaned free from any outer fleshes as we had to use only the
gel as a medium in a way it forms a biotemplate of pristine g-C2N, as follows. So, the obtained gel was dried in air and burnt
with camphor (Scheme 1b), which itself is a biofuel, in a vacuum furnace for 10 min at
250 °C. The powder formed as the end product (Scheme 1c) contained a large amount
of amorphous soot such as carbon that was removed by annealing the
sample at 600 °C for 2 h in a vacuum furnace. As shown in Scheme 1c, the pristine g-C2N is brownish in color, which soon turned blackish upon annealing
at 600 °C, as shown in Scheme 1d. Let us not confuse this g-C2N with g-C3N4 as, here, two atoms of carbon bond to one nitrogen
atom. Scheme 1e,f shows
the polycondensation reactions occurring where monomers having two
functional groups (OCN and OH groups) form a chain-like network by
a chemical reaction via successive bonding (van der Waals force exists
between the graphitic layer and carbon nitride). This is akin to g-C2N network bonding of C and N elements via O and H elements,
thus forming the scaffold of the whole structure, as shown in Scheme 1g,h, forming a template-like
growth of carbon nitride over graphitic sheets of carbon. A usual
triazine-based pattern of g-C2N is shown in Scheme 1i, where a chain of a monomeric
unit forms a bonded polymer via C, N, and H elements. At room temperature,
graphitic carbon nitride is a layered structure material where van
der Waals force acts on to hold the stacked layers of covalent C–N
bonds. Thus, each layer is composed of tri-s-triazine
units that are connected with polymeric amino groups. This tri-s-triazine ring kind of structure provides the polymer unit
chemical stability in both alkaline and acidic media and high thermal
stability up to 600 °C temperature in air.14Scheme 1j shows how the bonds (van der Waals force) present between graphitic
sheets and carbon nitride weaken at 600 °C and break completely
when annealed above it in Scheme 1k.

2.2 X-ray Diffraction and Phonons in Small g-C2N Template
Nanostructures
g-C2N is preferentially grown in
small template nanostructures of (131) facets exhibiting a modified
XRD pattern of a well-known g-C2N cubic (c) crystal structure
(Pa-3 space group28).
For example, a typical XRD pattern in Figure 1a,b from as-burnt and annealed g-C2N at 600 °C for 2 h in vacuum has markedly tailored peak positions
and intensities relative to those of bulk g-C2N prepared
in a solid-state reaction.28 It contains
a part of oxygen that bonds the graphitic layer to the carbon nitride
nanostructure. A normalized value Ip =
100 of a maximum peak intensity arises in the (131) peak at an interplanar
spacing d131 = 0.3178 nm instead of the
(111) peak at 0.6224 nm in the bulk sample. Here, one prominent peak
that is marked as (210) with an interplanar spacing d220 = 0.4244 nm shows a cubic phase, which grows over
amorphous graphite with a small increase in lattice parameters. A
polymorphic (cubic to hexagonal phase) c → h change occurs
in a bared g-C2N on a surface layer upon release. In Table 2 are given dhkl, Ip, and (hkl) values in XRD peaks observed in the samples. The dhkl values calculated by average lattice parameters a = 1.0205 nm, b = 1.0514 nm, and c = 1.1184 nm reproduce the observed values within a deviation
of ±0.0005 nm (under an error in the measured values) in the
major peaks of the as-burnt sample. A template of graphitized C-sp2 layer adapts its lattice parameters due to surface force
exerted by the C–N functional groups so as it has a decreased
lattice volume V′ = 1.2501 nm3 (density
ρ′ = 1.213 g-cm3) for the annealed sample
and lattice volume V = 1.1999 nm3 (density
ρ = 1.264 g-cm3) for as-burnt g-C2N over
a bulk value Vb = 1.2531 nm3 (ρb = 1.210 g·cm3). Upon annealing,
the as-burnt sample causes the graphitized layer to desorb off gradually,
thus showing a decrease in the intensity of peaks (broadening occurs)
due to surface C–N functional group reordering. Thus, a (220)
peak in the as-burnt sample depresses upon heating the sample at 600
°C, as shown in Table 3.

The C–N moieties arrange itself via oxygen
and hydrogen groups present at the surface of the graphitic carbon
sheet. Some functional groups such as OH presented at ∼3400
cm–1 due to intermolecular H bonds could be easily
removed by heating the samples at 100 °C before taking the IR
spectra. In Figure 2a, the five phonon bands shown at ∼2360, 1715, 1615, 1438,
and 1065 cm–1 have been assigned to C≡N stretching,
C=O stretching, C=N stretching, benzene ring, and C–N
stretching vibrations.10,29,30 When g-C2N is annealed at 600 °C for 2 h, IR phonon
bands in Figure 2b
from 600–1800 cm–1 disappear while thinning
g-C2N in a sample by removal of functional groups from
the surface of template graphitic carbon. The band group assigned at 1428 cm–1 is a benzene-like
carbon ring as it reproduces a 2D network over a graphitic carbon
in a co-bonded surface layer. The IR bands
of annealed samples can be well compared with those of carbon dots
formed by washing the as-prepared sample, as shown in Figure 2c, which connotes the clear
picture of assignments (functional groups) to each band present.

the spectra after washing (a) in acetone (inset).

The phonons of wide group C=C stretching are seen
in Figure 3 in the
Raman spectrum in the graphitic carbon nitride g-C2N where
C-sp2 is bonding coherently with a carbon nitride group
forming a template. As seen for a single D-band of 1329 cm–1 known in graphene,31 two distinct overlapping
bands are displaced one another at 1310 and 1415 cm–1 in a group in the as-burnt g-C2N sample (a bit shifted
to 1350 and 1395 cm–1 in the annealed sample), similarly
in two major graphitized carbon bands assignments framed on C2N facets—most likely (131) and (031), as seen in template
growth of g-C2N plates as in the HRTEM images. Similarly,
Raman bands expand in the single-phonon band with a high-intensity
G-band (of 1591 cm–1 in graphene) with an average
frequency of 1580 cm–1 (a bit shifted to 1585 cm–1 in the annealed sample) as a result of graphitized
carbon template trying to oscillate coherently to the C–N functional
groups bonded via oxygen. Further, the ID/IG ratio has grown further from 0.80
for as-prepared g-C2N to 0.85 in account of an induced
local microstrain in the conjoint structure, as evident from a large
γ = 0.86% value analyzed for the samples in terms of inhomogeneous
broadening in the XRD peaks in Table 2. Even a core–shell nanostructure of C-Fe3O4 shows only a single G-band at ∼1590 cm–1 when the shell thickness of the nanostructure is
varied.32 The part of the graphitized template
bonded to the carbon nitride functional group via oxygen tries to
release and rebind upon annealing at 600 °C, reducing the intensity
of D and G phonon bands in a wide group with a shift to higher frequencies
by smaller values. When the as-burnt g-C2N is probed to
measure at higher frequencies, the Raman phonon bands generated D′,
2D, and G + D at 2387, 2616, and 2883 cm–1, respectively.

Figure 3 Raman
spectra of the (a) as-prepared and (b) annealed g-C2N using
an Aloe vera gel.

To find out the chemical state of g-C2N, we probed
in to comprehend the details of XPS by analyzing the spectrum in Figure 4a. The quality and
composition of samples are well shown through XPS spectra. The oxidation
states of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen elements in g-C2N were obtained in Figure 4b–d. These XPS spectra were calibrated using the C1s
peak at 284.6 eV. The existence of the carbon peak was attributed
to the adsorption of the residue of organics present in the Aloe vera gel during the synthesis process. The carbon
element in the g-C2N sample gives two broad peaks at ∼287.6
(285.3), and 283.7 eV for C=O (2p1/2) (C–O),
and C–C (marked with 2p3/2). The asymmetric XPS
of O1s shows that several oxygen moieties are present on the surface
region; lattice oxygen centered at 529 and 530 eV is assigned for
the OH– group, 532 eV for the O2– group, and 533 eV for H2O. The nitrogen N1s element present
in g-C2N shows one band assigned to C–N–C
group centered at 398 eV and another at 400 eV assigned to the N–H
group.7,20

The local g-C2N microstructure is refined,
thereby releasing the template graphitized carbon with embedded carbon
nitride nanodots bonded via functional groups. In Figure 5a,b, FESEM images show how
tiny nanodots as small as 10–50 nm embed the surface of the
graphitized carbon layer, forming a template. Thus, embedding as a
“second-level hierarchical structure” as a composite
template with a thickness of 15–20 nm. Figure 5c displays the plate-like sheets uniformly
separated when seen in a microscale range of FESEM. When this image
was magnified as in Figure 5d, it clearly shows the embedded nanodots on the surface layer
bonding via functional groups to the graphitized carbon sheets. As
soon this graphitized carbon layer is heated or washed with organic
solvents (acetone), it etches out, leaving nanodots of the carbon
with templates as rectangular prisms/plates (w =
20–40 nm width and ϑ = 10–20 nm depth), which
contain a pure carbon layer that is displayed as a bright outline
with a thickness of 10–20 nm, as seen in the FESEM images in Figure 5d. The stage of template
growth of pure g-C2N nanostructures has a better stability
in a rigid C-sp2 template layer bonded via C–N–O
bonds in a regular two-dimensional network. Such g-C2N
cross-link through C–N–O bonds as a second-level hierarchical
structure in a small nanotemplate structure, as seen in FESEM images
in Figure 5. Similarly,
HRTEM images in Figure 6a–d show a close view of template plates of graphitized carbon
bonded to surface carbon nitride nanodots via functional groups of
C–O entities, with a magnified region in inset of Figure 6a. Figure 6b,c displays the carbon plate-embedding
nanodots of g-C2N of 20–55 nm in the dispersed microstructure.
Exfoliated graphitized plates in the form of films (150–250
nm wide and 300–600 nm long) are seen in the lattice image
of HRTEM as in Figure 6a,b, which looks transparent with a few nanometer thickness. Figure 6a shows the layers
of graphite sheets more in region A (darker) and less in region B
(brighter) similarly in Figure 6b, which exhibits thin sheets of graphite-like carbon grafted
with small carbon nitride crystallites marked as A and B on carbon
sheet C, which has a d-spacing of 0.3344 nm for the
(343) crystallographic plane (fringe formed due to interference of
light refracted from carbon nitride lattice and graphite layers). Thus, from the literature,
O2– inclusion as in a graphitized C–O network
markedly gets stretched to over a d-spacing of 0.3356
nm for the (002) plane in the pure graphite.33,34 A C-sp2 graphitic network thus expands via co-bonding
with N2– and O2– on carbon plates,
which adapts concurrently as foresaid using Raman and FTIR bands in
softer phonons. Figure 6c shows the carbon nitride
crystallites of sizes 20–50 nm bonding to the graphite layered
sheets of carbon. Figure 6d shows the lattice image of g-CN where a boundary separates
the amorphous graphite sheet with carbon nitride crystallites with
a d-spacing of 0.1816 nm of the (343) crystallographic
plane. Some larger lattice entities found in FESEM images become opaque,
which are not easy to be seen in HRTEM images. Figure 6e,f shows the SAED pattern of graphitic carbon
nitride (small g-C2N plates/prisms (w =
10–20 nm)) having concentric rings, indicating that the carbon
nitride particles are well dispersed and bonded in a polycrystalline
form. It clearly exhibits from the pattern of (332) and (343) arrays
with spacing values of d332 = 0.2240 nm
and d343 = 0.1816 nm, stacking ⊥
to a [131] zone axis, as studied using an e– beam
incident facing its (303) facet.

2.3 Optical Properties of Small g-C2N Template Nanostructures
The insets of Figure 7a,b show the Tauc plots of
the as-prepared and annealed g-C2N at 600 °C, respectively,
to manifest the band gap Eg. Here, (αhν)1/r versus energy hν in eV was plotted, where α is the normalized value
of  (in cm–1), h is denoted as Planck’s
constant (6.626 × 10–34 J·s), and ν
is the frequency of light. The following values of the exponent r denote the nature of the transition:35−37r = 1/2 for direct allowed transitions; r = 3/2 for
direct forbidden transitions; r = 2 for indirect
allowed transitions; r = 3 for indirect forbidden
transitions.

Figure 7 Electronic absorption spectra and Tauc plots for (a) as-prepared
and (b) annealed g-C2N at 600 °C.

The outcome plot of the analysis shows a distinct linear
region that specifies the onset of absorption. Thus, we need to extrapolate
the linear regime to the abscissa hν by reproducing
the energy of the optical band gap of the g-C2N nanostructures
for all its samples. The band gap of as-prepared g-C2N comes to be ∼3.9
eV, which increases to 4.12 eV upon annealing at 600 °C, thus
showing a quantum confinement and blue-shift. The value ε varies
in relation to absorbance, while the C value controls the solute–solute
and solvent–solute interactions. The size and morphology of structures in the solute along with the
solvent determine the interactions to the C value. For example, in
the extinction coefficient of the sample (as-prepared g-C2N (molecular weight = 38), the concentration C is
0.1 mg in 10 mL,  (optical length
of quartz cell) is 10 mm = 1 cm, and absorbance A = 1.31 at 263 nm is calculated below, which comes to be ∼5
× 103 M–1 L cm–1, while this extinction coefficient for g-C2N annealed
at 600 °C decreases to lower values of spin-allowed transitions
of ∼6.9 × 102 M–1 L cm–1 with a hike in the band gap.  

It is interesting
to learn that the synthesized as-prepared and annealed (at 600 °C)
g-C2N samples extend the strong emission in ultraviolet
as well as along the visible regions. Unusually, the bands were not
observed with significant intensity in the absorption spectra. For
example, Figure 8a,b
compares light excitation and emission spectra measured for the as-prepared,
annealed, and washed samples of g-C2N using a pulse xenon
lamp as a light source. The present emission spectra were measured
by exciting the samples at λex = 240 nm, while the
excitation spectra were monitored corresponding to the emission band
at λem = 512 nm in finding the optical origin of
these bands of the electronic transitions. Two broad groups of emission
bands appear over 300–580 nm and 580–900 nm in a common
λex = 240 nm excitation, while those of the excitation
spectra appear in a strong group in the extreme UV region over 240
to 340 nm with rather weak bands over longer wavelengths of 310–430
nm on common λem = 512 nm irradiation by the xenon
lamp. As described elsewhere, the blue light emission near 430 nm
ascribes to the C–C transitions, and the red emission near
675 nm ascribes to the C–O transitions of the g-C2N lattice. A strong excitation band prevails below 240 nm due a charge-transfer
transition between O2– and C2+ and the
band gap transition in the g-C2N crystallites. Eventually,
the π → nπ* promotes both the
emission (model inset of Figure 8) and excitation bands over the entire regions, which
is a demand nowadays in tuning the light absorption, emission, and
associated properties in this kind of hybrid nanocomposite.

burning out a residual carbon.

2.4 Photocatalytic Mechanism and Degradation of
MB Dye
Photocatalytic mechanism can be well explained in
four steps. The first step is the absorption of light (i.e., photons)
via photocatalysts (graphitic carbon nitride), and then the electrons
get excited from a valence band to a conduction band. The second step
is the result of electron–hole pair recombination that occurs
either in the core of the materials or on the surface of it, that
is, related to the release of energy in the form of light emission
(luminescence) or as heat of the lattice. The third step can be attributed
to the recombination of charges (electrons and holes) as the important
process that controls the overall photocatalyst efficiency after the
absorption of photons (light energy). Charges (electrons or holes)
that migrate onto the surface layer of the photocatalysts do not go
through the recombination and may indulge in other oxidation and reduction
reactions with adsorbents such as oxygen, water, and any other inorganic
or organic species. We can postulate the reactions in four steps as
follows:38 step 1, absorption of light
(photocatalysts + hν → photocatalysts
× (e– + h+)); step 2, recombination
(e– + h+ → hν
+ heat); step 3, reduction of adsorbents + e– →
adsorbent–; step 4, oxidation of adsorbents + h+ → adsorbent+.

A methylene blue dye
with a concentration of 2.6 × 10–6 M was well
mixed with g-C2N photocatalysts of ∼1.6 mg with
a final concentration of ∼5 × 10–5 M.
This material acts as a sensitizer for the light irradiated to stimulate
the whole mechanism due to its electronic structure that is formed
by a completely/partially filled valence band (VB) and a vacant conduction
band (CB). One of the best methods that can be used for applications
such as degradation of hazardous pollutants of waste produced from
industries, production of hydrogen gas, purification of air, and antibacterial
activity38−40 is the photocatalytic mechanism. When light is irradiated
(photons) on the surface-graphitized g-C2N hybrid catalyst,
if this energy is equivalent to or more than band gap energy, then
valence band electrons are excited to the conduction band, causing
hole formation in the valence band. These holes could oxidize donor
molecules and react with water molecules to form hydroxyl ions. The
electrons present in the conduction band could actively react with
dissolved oxygen ions to form superoxide ions, leading to redox reactions.
Now, the electrons and holes present in CB and VB can go under the
oxidation and reduction process with any species absorbed on the surface
of the catalyst. The degradation of methylene blue dye without a catalyst
in the presence of UV and visible light shows a marked degradation
of ∼12–13%, as shown in Figure 9a. Then, the performance of the photocatalytic
degradation of g-C2N powders (as-prepared and annealed
at 600 °C) was studied by considering methylene blue (MB) as
the target dye. Photocatalytic studies were done under UV (24 W; intensity,
400 lux; λ < 400 nm) and visible light bulb irradiation at
the sample surface under stirring condition. In Figure 9b, as the UV and visible light irradiating
time t reaches 60 min, the methylene blue dye in
the as-prepared sample decays rapidly until a minimum C/Co ≅ 100%. A nearly two times
larger dye lasts in the annealed sample under both UV and visible
light irradiation, decaying much slowly at ∼60%. The graphitic surface
layer in the as-prepared sample promptly favors its catalytic feature,
which breaks down at 600 °C (van der Waals force weakens between
the graphitic layer and carbon nitride groups), causing slow degradation
of dye. A reasonably larger degradation rate constant k = 0.015 min–1 (against 0.003 min–1 in the annealed graphitic carbon nitride) thus prolongs in a pseudo-first-order
reaction in a nonlinear regression of ln(C/Co) = −kt over t in Figure 9c in this example. Other samples involve much lower k-values as determined, assuming the linear plots in Figure 9c.

3 Conclusions
A biogenic template of
graphitized carbon species bonded to surface carbon nitride via functional
groups dispersed uniformly in a green Aloe vera gel has been explored to synthesize stable g-C2N template
hybrid nanostructure reactions in its small tissues at moderate temperature,
a facile biogenic synthesis. An Aloe vera-obtained green gel was dried in air, then finely dispersed and pulverized
in camphor, and burnt in a vacuum furnace at 250 °C for 10 min.
The rate of production was obtained at ∼0.33%. Finally, the
so-obtained 20 mg powder was pulverized using mortar and pestle to
uniformly finely divide the powder. A fine biocomplex is grown in
situ in the synthesis with multifunctional properties. It thins down
the graphitic layer as plates when the as-prepared g-C2N sample was heated ≥600 °C in a vacuum furnace for 2
h. The results were characterized using XRD, HRTEM, SAED, and lattice
images of the g-C2N samples obtained of small template
nanostructures. As seen for a D-band, two distinct overlapping bands
are displaced on one another at 1310 and 1415 cm–1 in a group in the as-burnt g-C2N sample (1329 cm–1 known in graphene), while a single phonon band with
a high intensity G-band (of 1591 cm–1 in graphene)
with an average frequency of 1580 cm–1 is displaced
in a group in the as-burnt g-C2N sample (a bit shifted
to 1350 cm–1 in the annealed sample). Last, optical and
photocatalytic properties were measured in comparison to microstructures
of g-C2N template nanostructures.

Section
4.1 Synthesis of Biogenic g-CN and C–O
Moieties Template Growth
Regarding the biogenic template
growth of graphitic carbon nitride using the self-combustion route
of small tissues in a green Aloe vera gel, here, carbon nitride bonded to surface-layered graphitic sheets
was synthesized as follows. A fresh gel of around 6 g was extracted from the inner parts of
green leaves of an Aloe vera plant
(from a garden at IIT-Kharagpur), and any immiscible fleshes were
washed away by using a specific filter (made of steel) with 50–100
μm pores. It was then dried and burnt in a vacuum furnace using
camphor as a fuel agent at 250 °C for 10 min. The rate of production
was obtained around 0.33%. Finally, the so-obtained 20 mg powder was
pulverized using mortar and pestle to uniformly finely divide the
powder. A hybrid-phase g-C2N emerged after the organics
had been burnt out in a self-propagating spontaneous combustion in
camphor (a fuel). It was heated at 600 °C in a vacuum furnace
for 2 h to remove impurities of carbon (soot) obtained while burning
with camphor. We even derived graphene oxide by simply washing as-prepared
g-C2N in acetone, which certainly etches out the outer
surface of g-C2N; the only ones remaining were graphene-layered
sheets with functional groups on it, which are also called as C–O
moieties.

4.2 Measurements of the g-C2N Structure
and Properties
The XRD patterns were scanned over 20°
to 80° of diffraction angle 2θ by using an X-ray diffractometer
(X’PertPro PANalytical), with an X-ray beam of Cu Kα
of λ = 0.15410 nm in wavelength, which delineate a semi-crystalline
g-C2N of as-burnt and annealed powders. The data were collected
slowly at small 2θ intervals under 0.01° in resolving the
weak intensity peaks. Size, morphology, and surface topology in the
g-C2N samples were studied with field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) using a ZEISS EVO 60 FESEM at 5–20
kV acceleration voltages. High-resolution transmission electron microscopic
(HRTEM) images, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), and lattice
images of the samples mounted on a carbon-coated copper grid were
studied using an analytical TEM of FEI Tecnai G2 20S-TWIN operating
at 200 kV. The C-sp2, as a breed of a 2D network (amorphous)
on coherent g-C2N facets, exhibits multiple D- and G-bands
in Raman spectra over 1200 to 1800 cm–1 as studied
by exciting the samples at 514.5 nm by an Ar+ ion laser.
Binding energies (Eb) in the XPS bands
were calibrated with the adventitious C1s at 284.6 eV. The photocatalytic
performance of powders (as-prepared and annealed at 600 °C) was
studied by considering methylene blue as the target dye.

The
absorbance A states how much radiation an object
absorbs of particular λ values in such transitions. The Beer–Lambert
relation describes A of a sample of a specific concentration
through which a continuous beam of light is allowed to travel. In
a logarithmic scale used in the absorption spectrophotometer, the
realistic value  is the optical
length that is 10 mm, and C is the concentration
of the solution (0.1 mg of sample in 10 mL of distilled water) obtained
from , where ε is the extinction
coefficient, also known as absorption coefficient with a unit M–1 L cm–1. Photocatalytic studies were done
under UV (24 W; intensity, 400 lux; λ < 400 nm) and visible
irradiation at the sample surface under stirring condition. Aqueous
solutions of methylene blue with a concentration 5 × 10–5 M with a photocatalyst loading of 1 g/L were taken. The dispersions
were equilibrated for dye adsorption on the photocatalyst surface
for 30 min. During the degradation period, the dispersions were collected
at regular intervals of 30 min in the case of UV light irradiation.
To note down the extent of the degradation, the samples were centrifuged
at 6000 rpm for 10 min to collect the so-far degraded dye solution.
Using the PerkinElmer spectrophotometer, powder dispersed in distilled
water (0.01 g L–1) was used to measure its light
absorption spectrum (200–850 nm) relative to distilled water
as a reference, using an Edinburgh FL spectrometer by a xenon lamp
900.
