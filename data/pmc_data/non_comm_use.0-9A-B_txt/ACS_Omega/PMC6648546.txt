Graphene oxide (GO)
is an attractive precursor for graphene, provided
by the well-known wet-chemical oxidative process. The intercalation
of acid in graphite is considered as a crucial step, and its subsequent
oxidation holds special relevance in synthesis. So far, the above
chemistry is dominated by usage of H2SO4. Recently,
H3PO4 appeared as a suitable intercalant for
graphite. However, its role is not well understood in the formation
of GO, especially when present as a co-acid with H2SO4. Additionally, a relatively lower toxicity of H3PO4 as compared to H2SO4, elimination
of toxic NaNO3 usage, and a facile purification protocol
are encouraging in terms of low-cost production of GO with a reduced
environmental impact. Here, we report the systematic synthesis and
characterization of GOs prepared with the variation in the ratio of
H2SO4 and H3PO4. Ab initio
simulations revealed that intercalation is primarily affected because
of the usage of a mixture of co-acids. Interestingly, the ratio of
the acids dictated the nature of the functionalities, extent of the
defects, and morphology of the GOs, accounting for a pronounced effect
on thermal stability, contact angle, zeta potential, and hydrodynamic
size. The oxidation mechanism showed a predominance of H2SO4 content, whereas H3PO4 is found
to mainly govern the intercalation of graphite, thereby affecting
the acid-based intercalation–oxidation chemistry of graphite.
The as-prepared GO suspension exhibited a high adsorption capacity
for methylene blue dye removal in water, suggesting its potential
as an adsorbent material in water treatment. The utility of the two
acids affects the acid-based intercalation–oxidation chemistry
of graphite and simultaneously may open up new opportunities for synthesized
GOs, on tenets of green chemistry, in a wide arena of applications.

1 Introduction
Graphene
oxide (GO) acts as a suitable precursor of graphene because
of its relative ease of preparation, handling, and processability
at a lower cost, thereby enabling its commercial applicability. It
can be used as such or modified chemically and/or thermally to further
extend its utility. Electronic and electrical applications demand
a more intact carbon framework of graphene with a larger sheet size
and existence of functionalities on the edges, whereas biomedical
applications favor a smaller sheet size with a higher degree of functionalities
at both edges and the basal plane. Thus, a good control in sheet size,
oxygen content, and nature of functionalities with optimization of
the synthesis process is of paramount importance to dictate the end-use
application.

In general, the wet-chemical oxidative synthetic
route for interconversion
of graphite to GO involves four steps,1 namely, (a) graphite intercalation, (b) oxidation, (c) exfoliation
of oxidized sheets, and (d) subsequent purification to remove impurities.
The extent of oxidation and nature of functionalities in GO is affected
by the nature and source of graphite,2,3 amount,4,5 and nature of oxidant,6,7 water,8 hydrogen peroxide,9 sulfuric
acid, physical parameters such as temperature,10 and reaction time.11−13

The formation of graphite
intercalation compounds (GICs) involves
insertion of small molecules/ions (guest) within the layers of graphite
(host) as favored by effective host–guest energetic dynamics
and interaction.14−18 Schafhaeutl and Brodie noticed the appearance of “blue-lustrous
color” in reflected and “purple color” in transmitted
light because of reaction of graphite with H2SO4 and oxidizing agents, which are attributed to the formation of GICs.19,20 Hofmann and Thiele reported the formation of GICs with H2SO4, in the presence of HNO3, KMnO4, HIO4, HClO4, selenic acid, and phosphoric
acid.21,22 The so-formed GICs are highly unstable and
known to decompose instantaneously even with atmospheric moisture.
It is reported that the oxidation of graphite to form C–O bonds
occurs at the intercalation stage and/or with the treatment of KMnO4, as aided by the generation of charge on the sp2-hybridized carbon.23 The interlayer distances
of GICs formed by H2SO4 and H3PO4 are similar, 7.3–7.9 Å, with the latter having
a higher intercalation efficiency, suggesting that H3PO4 is as equally effective as H2SO4 and
worth exploring in graphene chemistry.24

Exfoliation of graphite flakes into defect-free few-layer
graphene
via a nonoxidative route is also reported by forming GICs24,25 and then explored for various applications.26,27 Recently, graphite intercalation has also been mediated by a K–tetrahydrofuran
complex, which facilitates the diffusion of DMSO molecules into the
intergalleries and results in widening of the interlayer spacing by
inducing strong dipolar interactions.28 However, all these reports are limited to exfoliation without proceeding
further to the oxidation step.

Nishina et al.29 reported that KMnO4 and H2SO4 alone are sufficient to convert
graphite to GO and NaNO3 is not necessary to facilitate
oxidation. Similarly, Tour et al.30 eliminated
the utility of NaNO3 by the introduction of H3PO4 as a co-acid to H2SO4 (1:9,
v/v) in KMnO4 (six equivalents)-mediated oxidation of graphite.
Lochab et al.31 further simplified the
purification procedure of GO synthesized by an improved method. GO
synthesized by the improved method differs significantly from Hummers’
method and revealed a predominance of different types of oxidative
functionalities, suggesting the role of H3PO4 in affecting the extent of oxidation. Likewise, H3PO4 and H3BO3 also assisted in a reasonable
exfoliation of graphite.32 Recently, efficacies
of intercalants on graphite have regenerated research interest, and
it is worth exploring their potential in generation of oxidized graphene
materials. However, the subsequent role of intercalation during the
oxidation of graphite to form GO still demands further exploration.
Interestingly, the greener aspect in GO preparation by recycling and
reuse of sulfuric acid is found to be attractive as it reduced the
amount of water required for purification and thereby lowered the
overall production cost.33 Kumar and Srivastava
et al.34 reported electrochemical exfoliation
of graphite electrodes in the presence of H2SO4 and H3PO4 as a pretreatment step, followed
by oxidation as a simple synthetic route for preparation of ∼10
μm GO sheets.

The most widely used Hummers’ method
for synthesis of GO
involved treatment of graphite with KMnO4 and NaNO3 in concentrated H2SO4 at 98 °C.
The reaction is considered to be hazardous, especially during the
scale-up of the reaction. Furthermore, the requirement of higher volumes
of acids demands an excessive amount of water for purification to
alleviate the corrosive nature of nanoparticles.35 This process accounts to a higher E-factor (environmental)
with generation of more waste, as a consequence leading to a greater
negative environmental impact. This motivates exploration of an effective
substitute to H2SO4 and NaNO3, which
can add greener potential to widely synthesized GO nanomaterial.

Interestingly, H3PO4 is a weak acid with
relatively lower toxicity and without hazardous issues of gas liberation.
It is widely used as a food additive and as an acidifying additive
in soft drinks. In the current work, GO is synthesized using various
co-mixtures of H2SO4 and H3PO4 (v/v) to analyze the effect of addition of H3PO4 on GO properties. Figure 1 shows a generalized synthetic procedure adopted in
the current work, and it is considered to be sustainable as compared
to Hummers’ method because of the following reasons: (i) H2SO4 is a highly corrosive irritant with a very
high toxicological profile, raising environment concerns, and therefore,
a safer alternative, H3PO4, with equivalent
intercalating efficacy in graphite needs exploration; (ii) no generation
of the toxic gas(es) SOx and NOx because of reduction in the volume of H2SO4 usage and elimination of NaNO3 in the process,
respectively; (iii) reaction is carried out at a milder temperature
of 50 °C, preventing explosion due to in situ generated oxidant
Mn2O7 from KMnO4 in acidic medium;36 (iv) lower energy requirement for the reaction;
and (v) purification of synthesized GOs is followed mainly by a simple
gravity-settling process to encourage bulk synthesis with a cost-effective
and time-saving protocol.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of intercalation and
oxidation chemistry
of graphite using acids.

To further understand the role of acid intercalants on graphite,
we also performed computational studies. Experimentally, GOs are analyzed
systematically to determine the nature and extent of oxygen-rich functionalities
with variation in the ratio of intercalants. An appreciable effect
in generated oxo-functionalities in GOs is revealed as a function
of the acid ratio, simultaneously assisting in developing an understanding
of acid-based intercalation–oxidation chemistry of graphite.
The so-formed GOs differ significantly in their properties, which
may open up new avenues to various graphene-dominated applications.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Graphite
flakes (Alfa Aesar,
99.8%, 325 mesh, 44 μm), sulfuric acid (Finar), potassium permanganate,
phosphoric acid, hydrogen peroxide (30%, w/v), and methylene blue
(MB) dye (Fisher Scientific) were used as received.

2.2 Characterization Techniques
Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS5
spectrometer equipped with an iD5-ATR accessory, in the range of 800–2000
cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Absorbance measurements were carried out on a Thermo Scientific
Evolution 201 UV–vis spectrophotometer by preparing dispersions
of the respective nanomaterial in deionized water. Raman spectra were
obtained using a STR 500 confocal micro-Raman spectrometer by Airix
Corporation at λ of 532 nm. The distance between defects points
(LD) and average crystallite size (La) of the sp2 domains in the GO samples
was calculated according to the literature.37,38 X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed on PANalytical X’pert
Pro Powder with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron Multiprobe Surface Analysis
System) measurements were carried out using a monochromatized Al Kα
(1486.7 eV) radiation source to analyze the surface chemistry of synthesized
GOs. Thermal behavior was investigated using Shimadzu, Japan, DTG-60
in the temperature range of 50–800 °C under nitrogen atmosphere
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Elemental analysis was performed
using Elementar (Germany, Vario EL III). The average particle size
and zeta potential (ζ) of the particles were measured by the
dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument (Nanosizer, Malvern, UK)
with an Ar laser (λ = 830 nm, detector angle = 90°, and
sample volume = 10 μL at room temperature). The surface morphology
of synthesized GOs was studied using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM; Nova Nano FE-SEM 450 (FEI)) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM; The Tecnai G2 20 (FEI) S-Twin) at an accelerating voltage of
10 and 200 kV, respectively. Contact angle (CA) measurements were
performed to characterize the surface properties of GO on glass substrates
using a CA Metering System ACAM D3 (Apex Instruments). A drop of MilliQ
water (2 μL) was placed on the surface of the GO-coated surface
(200 μL of GO dispersion, 0.5 mg/mL followed by heating in an
air-oven at 50 °C), and images were immediately captured using
a CCD camera equipped with a magnifying lens. The CA reported is an
average value of five measurements at different locations. The optical
images of GO coated on the glass substrate were taken using a fluorescence
microscope (Nikon, eclipse Ti-U, Make-Japan). For dye removal assay,
GO (1.5 mg/mL, 400 μL) was mixed with MB (1 mg/L, 800 μL)
by a vortex mixer. The suspension was incubated at 25 °C for
1 h and then centrifuged (Eppendorf 5810R) at 14 000 rpm for
20 min, and a supernatant was used to record the absorbance.

2.3 Computational Details
The computational
study of intercalation of H2SO4 and H3PO4 acids between the graphitic layers was performed using
the density functional theory-based approach, as implemented in the
Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).39,40 A 6 × 3 × 1 supercell of graphite was considered to model
GIC with different concentrations of acid molecules having H2SO4/H3PO4 ratios (with molar volumetric
ratios in parenthesis) as 4:0 (10:0), 3:1 (∼7:3), 2:2 (∼4:6),
and 0:4 (0:10) in between the carbon layers. For each ratio, various
configurations of GIC were modeled and relaxed to obtain the minimum
energy structure. The electron–ion interactions in all the
calculations were treated using projector-augmented wave41 pseudo-potentials with a plane-wave energy cutoff
of 520 eV. To account for the exchange correlation interactions, the
generalized gradient approximation with van der Waals (vdW) corrections
[optimized Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof-vdW (optPBE-vdW)]42−45 was used to incorporate vdW interactions between the acid molecules
and the graphitic layers. A Γ-centered k-point
grid of 4 × 8 × 4 was considered for all the abovementioned
configurations. The total energy convergence criterion for the self-consistent
calculations was set to be 10–4 eV, whereas a Hellmann–Feynman
force convergence criterion of 0.01 eV/Å was set for all the
calculations.

2.4 Oxidation of Graphite
To graphite
flakes (0.5 g) in a conical flask kept in an ice bath, a designated
volume of the H2SO4/H3PO4 (67 mL; 10:0, 8:2, 5:5, 2:8, 0:10, v/v) mixture was added. The mixture
was stirred for 15 min before the addition of KMnO4 (3
g). Upon complete addition, the reaction mixture was heated to 50
°C and stirred for 12 h. The reaction was allowed to cool down
to room temperature before addition of H2O2 (3
mL) followed by the addition of distilled water (220 mL). The reaction
mixture was allowed to stir for 15 min, and the stirring was stopped
to carry out the purification process. Purification was carried out
by gravity settling for ratios 10:0, 8:2, and 5:5 and the rest were
purified by centrifugation. The residue of GO was washed and re-dispersed
in water to remove excess acid until the pH of the supernatant was
found to be neutral. The residue obtained was dried at 60 °C
in a vacuum oven to form GO. The GOs synthesized are named as 10:0,
8:2, 5:5, 2:8, and 0:10 depending on the ratio of H2SO4/H3PO4 used in the synthesis.

3 Results and Discussion
The formation of GICs occurs
via protonation of the benzenoid ring
with acid to form graphite sulfuric acid intercalate, [C24+(HSO4–)(H2SO4)2]n,21 with an increase in interlayer spacing to 7.98 Å (cf.
graphite 3.4 Å).1,46 Likewise, H3PO4 also accounted for the expansion of graphite layers.24 At this stage, a fewer lattice defects are also
generated because of formation of oxo-species47,48 on H2SO4-intercalated graphene as a result
of electron transfer to the conducting graphite with compensation
of charges prior to the entry of KMnO4.49 This suggested intercalation as one of the crucial steps,
and it may be responsible for affecting the quality of oxidized graphene.50 The intercalants act by opening up the edge
of graphite, allowing the diffusion of acid further to open the gap
in the graphite sheets. Once entered, it impedes the re-stacking of
the sheets, mediating the entry of oxidizing agents and assisting
their oxidation. The most widely used acid is H2SO4, which acts as an intercalant and also provides acidic pH
to assist in the oxidation of graphite with KMnO4.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effect of intercalants
on the interlayer spacing in graphite and on the associated intercalation
energy. First-principles quantum chemical calculations are performed
to model the graphitic systems with intercalant acid molecules H2SO4/H3PO4 in the ratios of
4:0 (10:0), 3:1 (7:3), 2:2 (4:6), and 0:4 (0:10) with the molar volumetric
ratio given in parenthesis. Figure 2a–d depicts the optimized structure of the lowest
energy configurations for each ratio of H2SO4/H3PO4. The formation of hydrogen bonding in
between the acid molecules is clearly evident from Figure 2, confirming their dipole–dipole
intermolecular interactions. The distances between oxygen and hydrogen
atoms participating in hydrogen bonding are summarized in Table S1. It can be noticed from the table that
a short intermolecular oxygen–hydrogen bond forms in between
the two H2SO4 acid molecules, as can be seen
in the cases of 4:0 and 3:1 (where the concentration of H2SO4 is higher). However, with the increase in H3PO4 content, longer bonding interactions are observed.

plot of graphite intercalated with H2SO4 and
H3PO4 in each ratio. (f) Table 1: Interlayer
distance and intercalation energy for different ratios of H2SO4 and H3PO4.

Table 1 (in Figure 2) tabulates the interlayer distance between the graphene layers
that
changes because of intercalation of acid molecules. On analyzing the
data, we noticed that the interlayer distance is maximum (9.27 Å)
in the case of neat H3PO4 (0:10), followed by
neat H2SO4 (8.73 Å), confirming that H3PO4 is as equally effective as H2SO4 in expanding the graphitic galleries, well in agreement with
the results of Kovtyukhova et al.24 In
the case of mixed acid concentrations, however, a relative decrease
in the interlayer distance is noticed. This distance decreases with
the addition of H3PO4 and goes to 8.66 Å
and then 8.39 Å, when the H2SO4/H3PO4 ratio is 3:1 (∼7:3) and 2:2 (∼4:6),
respectively. To check the variation of the intercalation efficiency
with respect to the acid ratio, we calculated the intercalation energy,
as shown in Table 1. Interestingly, a similar trend to the interlayer
distance is noticed in the intercalation energy. The value is maximum
in the case of neat H3PO4, 0:10 (−6.34
eV), whereas minimum is observed in the 4:6 ratio (−4.85 eV).
Overall, the intercalation energy is found to decrease with the increase
in the concentration of H3PO4 in the acid mixture.
These results suggest that the highest intercalation efficiency for
H3PO4 may provide enhancement in the formation
of GIC.

To understand these results in depth and further validate
our claim,
the charge density difference (ρdiff = ρgraphene+mols – ρgraphene –
ρmols) is calculated. The charge density differences
in 1-D and 3-D for each of the four computationally investigated systems
are depicted in Figures 2e and S1, respectively. The formation
of dipoles in between graphene and the molecules is clearly evident
from Figure S1. It is noticed that the
maximum charge transfer takes place in the interface region between
the graphene sheet and the acid molecules. Dipoles are also found
to form around the molecules (when z = 1.5–2
Å) where H3PO4 is present. Interestingly,
except in case of neat H2SO4, the dipole strength
is found to be maximum near the graphene sheets only. Thus, as compared
to H2SO4 molecules, H3PO4 acid molecules are found to transfer more charge to the graphene
sheet, as shown in Figure S1, suggesting
that H3PO4 molecules may provide assistance
for charge transfer to graphene through dipole formation.

The
computational results suggest that the incorporation of H3PO4 molecules can be helpful to increase the intercalation
efficiency of graphite layers. The formation of hydrogen bonding in
between the acid molecules can further assist the chemical oxidation
process at the basal plane efficiently. Therefore, based on our computational
intercalation efficiency results of the acid mixture combination,
the experiments were performed by varying the ratio of acids (H2SO4 and H3PO4) systematically
to mediate the synthesis of GO with KMnO4 and to unravel
their effect on the properties of GO.

As graphite oxidation
is also facilitated by water and hydrogen
peroxide,8,51−54 the same quantity of both is
utilized to assist the comparison. To begin with, the effect of variation
on the acid ratio is monitored during synthetic steps and the respective
yields of GO are obtained, as shown in Figure 3 and Table S2.

Figure 3 (a) Synthetic
scheme for GO preparation; (b) optical images during
synthesis of GO with variation of the intercalant ratio (H2SO4/H3PO4) at various stages captured
at different times. The inset shows the diluted volumes of the reaction
mixture which can be noticed by the respective color changes.

The usual purple color of KMnO4 is observed in graphite
initially. The addition of acid (nature and ratio) to the reaction
mixture resulted in noticeable color changes with time (0.5 h vs 12
h), as shown in Figure 3b. Neat H2SO4 addition showed a characteristic
green color. With an increase in H3PO4 in the
acid ratio, a drastic color change is observed. In the initial 30
min, H2SO4/H3PO4 samples
showed a greenish to reddish brown, and then further pink and black
colors after 12 h, suggesting the effect of variation in the ratios
of the two acids in the formation of GO. Further, the addition of
hydrogen peroxide/water also resulted in a visible change in color
from the usual yellowish-orange to lustrous black with increase in
the amount of H3PO4 in the reaction mixture.

The appearance of different colors at various stages is a consequence
of subsequent intercalation/de-intercalation of compounds and existence
of different oxidation states of manganese ions in the reaction mixture.
In general, bulk synthesis of GO is indicated by the conversion of
black color of graphite to yellow color in aqueous peroxide, which
upon drying resulted in the formation of a brown to yellow graphite
oxide. In our case, the finally purified GO showed both a different
color and state. The 10:0 ratio resulted in a brown film, whereas
0:10 existed as a black lustrous powder. The intermediate ratios exhibited
a lighter shade of brown and yellow thin films, whereas 8:2 resulted
in a black film. Furthermore, the yield of the obtained oxidized material
is varied and is found to be substantially high when H3PO4 is present as a co-acid in the reaction mixture. A
higher yield is suggestive of the formation of a highly oxidized material26 and entrapment of species, if any.

The
effect of different intercalating agents on conversion of graphite
to oxidized material is analyzed by XRD, as shown in Figure 4a. It is reported that besides
the reaction conditions, the temperature of drying of GO dispersion
is also important,12 which is again kept
the same, to ascertain and compare the degree of oxidation in synthesized
GO by XRD. The absence of the characteristic peak due to graphite
at 26.8° excludes their occurrence in all the samples except
0:10 in H2SO4/H3PO4. The
interlayer spacing (d) evaluated on the d001 plane can be correlated to the degree of oxidation.
The “d” value between the layers increased
from 3.35 Å in pristine graphite to 8.75 Å in neat H2SO4 (10:0)-treated graphite and is found to be
in excellent agreement with our computational analysis (8.73 Å
in H2SO4-intercalated graphite, Table 1). On
the contrary, neat H3PO4 (0:10) revealed a “d” value of 3.36 Å, suggesting that H2SO4 may have a higher potential to assist exfoliation
and oxidation of graphite than H3PO4 alone.
However, the former option may be ruled out, as H3PO4 exhibited a higher interlayer distance, intercalation energy,
and charge density accumulation in graphene sheets as observed from
our computational studies.24 Additionally,
this is also supported from our observation that with the addition
of H3PO4 in H2SO4, that
is, when the acid ratio (H2SO4/H3PO4) is 8:2, the highest evaluated “d” of 9.27 Å was revealed, representing the strongest
oxidation and higher exfoliation. A lower “d” of 9.0 Å is reported with the 9:1 (H2SO4/H3PO4) mixture for the same size graphite
flakes.30 This further confirmed that an
initial increase in H3PO4 content in H2SO4 assisted in expanding the graphite galleries to aid
the oxidation of basal planes. With further increase in H3PO4 content, that is, 5:5 and 2:8, “d” reduced to 9.05 and 6.41 Å, respectively, supporting
a lowering in the capability of the acid mixture to facilitate oxidation
of graphite by KMnO4. The XRD results suggested that oxidation
is extensive up to an equal volume ratio (5:5) of the acids.

Figure 4 (a) Powder
XRD spectra of graphite and GOs synthesized by varying
intercalant ratios (H2SO4/H3PO4) with their corresponding interlayer spacing “d” (calculated using Bragg’s equation: nλ = 2d sin θ) and fwhm (Γ)
values. (b) FTIR spectra of synthesized GOs and their characteristic
vibration bands due to presence of different oxygenated functionalities.

A similar reduction in the interlayer
distance is observed in the
co-acid mixture from our computational results, as shown in Table
1. The primary step for the formation of GICs involved protonation
of the benzene ring with acid followed by reactions facilitating the
generation of oxo-functionalities in graphite. Therefore, H3PO4 may be prudential to form GIC, but may not be as effective
as H2SO4 to oxidize because of its relatively
weak acidic nature, as apparent from its acidity dissociation constant
(Ka) values, H2SO4 (1.1 × 103) ≫ H3PO4 (7.1 × 10–3). Probably, an optimum ratio
of two acids is desired to facilitate both exfoliation and oxidation.
It is well known that KMnO4 exhibits variable oxidation
states depending upon the nature and pH of the mixture. Neat H3PO4 and up to 50% of H3PO4 conc. showed a reduction in the oxidation state of manganese in
KMnO4 from Mn7+ to Mn3+ with an in
situ evolution of oxygen.55 However, in
neat H2SO4, it changes from Mn7+ to
Mn2+, indicating different oxidizing potentials of permanganate
in the presence of two acids.

Additionally, a significant broadening
in the XRD peak in synthesized
GOs is observed as confirmed from the change in the full width at
half maximum (fwhm, Γ) from 0.1 to 0.4 in 10:0 to 2:8 of H2SO4/H3PO4-treated graphite,
as shown in Figure 4a. This is attributed to the lattice distortion that occurs in the
vertical stacking order of the graphite lattice56 because of the generation of heterogeneous nanostructures
associated with variable extents of oxidation. As compared to graphite,
the 0:10 sample (inset of Figure 4a) clearly showed a substantial difference in Γ
and peak position. This shift to a lower 2-theta value and reduced
Γ in 0:10 can be attributed to the changes in the chemical/physical
environment across the sheets upon treatment with H3PO4.

Chemical oxidation of graphite to GO is supported
by FTIR (Figure 4b)
and is consistent
with the literature data.57 The characteristic
stretching vibration modes due to O–H, >C=O of carboxylic
acid and ketonic, sp2-hybridized C=C, and C–O–C
epoxide functionalities are observed at 3200, 1730, 1625, and 1054
cm–1, respectively.58,59 As compared
to 10:0, the prominence of >C=O, C–O–C, and
the
O–H peak in ratios 8:2 and 5:5 is apparent, confirming the
richness of their surfaces with highly oxidized functionalities. In
the case of 2:8 and 0:10, the peaks are ill-defined and quite broad.
This suggested the occurrence of either a comparative lower degree
of oxidation and/or existence of physically and chemically bound structures
due to H3PO4 treatment on graphite, which is
in congruence with XRD. The 0:10 sample showed intense stretching
vibrations because of H3PO4 and organo-phosphates.
The peaks observed at 980, 1178, and 890 cm–1 are
attributed to the P–O–C, hydrogen-bonded P=O,
and P–O bond, respectively.60,61

Figure 5 shows the
XPS of GOs to understand the effect of addition of H3PO4 as a co-acid on the generation of chemical functionalities
in GO. A significant difference in the C 1s XPS spectra (Figure 5a) is reflected,
confirming the potentiality in the formation of different types of
oxidative-functionalized species on the surface of GO by varying the
ratio of the two acids. The C 1s XPS spectra of all the synthesized
GOs (Figure 5b–f)
are de-convoluted and fitted at a binding energy (B.E.) of ∼284.6,
286.2, 288.1, and 289.6 eV corresponding to the C=C/C–C/C–H,
C–OH/epoxy, C=O, and COOH functional groups, respectively.
The evolution of various functionalities and their respective percentage
components determined are tabulated in Table S3.

Figure 5 High-resolution XPS spectra: (a) stacked C 1s; (b–f) deconvoluted
C 1s of synthesized GOs with variation in the extent and nature of
oxidative functionalities. The four distinct regimes observed are
COOH (pink), C=O (green), C–O–C/C–OH (red),
and C=C, C–C, C–H (blue).

In general, epoxy and hydroxyl functionalities exist on the
basal
plane, and their further oxidation demands breaking of C–C
bonds to introduce ketones and further to carboxyl functionalities
that are located at the edges of basal planes or at the periphery
of GO.62 As the source of graphite and
the adopted methodology are similar, the formation of various oxidized
functionalities is mainly attributed to the variation in the acid
ratio. The 10:0 and 0:10 samples clearly showed that neat H2SO4 resulted in the formation of a relatively higher oxidized
surface as compared to neat H3PO4 (Figure 4b), which is in accordance
with their effect on the oxidizing potential of KMnO4 and
intercalation efficiency of graphite.24,55

It is
observed that H3PO4 is not as effective
as H2SO4 to enable the oxidation of carbonyl
groups further to carboxylic acid. The peak corresponding to nonoxidized
graphitic C–C bonds at B.E. of 284–283 eV is the most
dominant peak in the 0:10 sample, inferring lowest defects induced
because of only H3PO4-treated graphite, which
corroborates well with XRD. On addition of H3PO4 in small quantity to H2SO4 (i.e., 8:2), the
percentage of COOH functionalities on GO is nearly unaffected. However,
a substantial increase in C=O and C–OH/C–O–C
functionalities is observed, confirming the assistance provided by
H3PO4 in expanding the galleries without compensating
the oxidizing potential of KMnO4/acid-mediated oxidation
of the graphite surface.

With a further increase in H3PO4 content,
5:5, a slight reduction in COOH groups is reflected, but sp2 domains are still highly etched as dominated by C=O and C–O–C/C–OH
groups, which is in good agreement with FTIR. However, with reversal
in ratio from 8:2 to 2:8, COOH functionalities doubled with richness
of C–C/C–H structures, as shown in Table S3. Surprisingly, a nearly 2.5-fold reduction in C–OH
and enhancement in C=O-rich groups is also observed. This reduction
in C–OH functionalities with increase in H3PO4 content is attributed to the conversion of 1,2-diols to the
cyclic structures to form C–O–P-linked organophosphates63 and/or to carbonyl groups from 1,1-diols64 because of the dehydrating nature of phosphoric
acid. Additionally, the water liberated because of conversion of H3PO4 to pyrophosphoric acid (2H3PO4 ⇌ H4P2O7 + H2O)55 may also be responsible for
prominence of sp2 carbon content65 which also increased with the increase in H3PO4 content, that is, for 5:5, 2:8, and 0:10, it increased to 19, 27,
and 75%, respectively. Beyond the 5:5 ratio of acid, that is, 2:8
and 0:10, phosphorus (P 2s and P 2p) peaks are evident at B.E. of
191.6 and 134.6 eV, respectively, which corresponds to P as in PO43–n of phosphoric acid
and organophosphates (Figure S2a).60,61,66,67 The atomic percentage of P determined as 2 and 13% for 2:8 and 0:10,
respectively, supported the observation in FTIR.

The stacked
O 1s spectra revealed a broadening of the peak with
a significant shift toward lower B.E., with the increase in H3PO4 in the intercalant ratio (Figure S2b). This asymmetric development in the shape of the
O 1s peak due to different oxidative functionalities suggested the
existence and variation of different chemical states of oxygen with
single and double bonds with variation in the acid ratio. The fitting
of O 1s of 10:0 clearly showed C–O and C=O and/or P=O
at 532.8 and 531.3 eV, respectively (Figure S2c).68 In addition to chemically bound oxygen
with carbon on GO, the latter peak also contains a component which
is ascribed to the adsorption of phosphoric acid on the GO surface.
Despite additional extensive efforts of purification of GOs prepared
with 2:8 and 0:10 acid content, P % still remained unchanged, which
may be responsible for slightly higher yields, as shown in Table S2. The atomic percentage determined from
elemental analysis (Table S4) also supported
the presence of S in the samples.

Optical images of GO aqueous
dispersions (Figure S3a) clearly showed brown color for all ratios, except 2:8
and 0:10, which is characteristic of existence of highly oxidized
GOs. The 2:8 and 0:10 samples showed a brown-gray color, inferring
a lower degree of oxygen functionalities. To scrutinize this behavior
and also the stability of aqueous dispersion, a time-dependent UV–vis
study was performed (Figure S3b). UV–vis
spectra of the GOs (Figure S3b) showed
absorption due to conjugated carbon double bonds and oxygenated functionalities
at ∼227 and ∼300 nm (shoulder), respectively, consistent
with the literature.2 The 0:10 sample showed
no absorption features because of its powdery, stacked nature due
to the least oxidized surface reconfirming that H3PO4 alone is not as equally effective as H2SO4 to etch the surface of graphite. The excellent aqueous dispersion
stability of synthesized GO from 10:0 to 5:5 is supported by optical
images with insignificant changes in absorbance values with time.
After 30 days, the absorbance intensity at 300 nm remains unchanged
in the 5:5 ratio, consistent with the presence of a higher amount
of oxidative functionalities, which is in congruence with XPS and
FTIR results. On the contrary, a substantial change in the optical
behavior of 2:8 is noticed, with change in absorbance values, which
is suggestive of the presence of larger particles with substantially
less oxidized areas and/or the existence of residual unoxidized graphite
particles.63 To ascertain whether the settled
nanoparticles are unoxidized graphite, they were separated, re-dispersed,
and analyzed by UV–vis (inset in Figure S3b) and FTIR (Figure S4). The characteristics
are similar to GO particles, confirming heterogeneity in the sample
with randomly and sparsely distributed oxo-functionalities with retention
of larger graphitic domains, in congruence with XRD and XPS. A noticeable
darkening of the aqueous GO dispersion (10:0) is observed after 15
and 30 days, suggesting time-mediated partial re-graphitization in
aqueous conditions.

Figure 6 shows the
Raman spectra to probe the degree of disorder in synthesized GOs,
and the results are compared with graphite.69 Pristine graphite revealed a weak D band (1356 cm–1) with a sharp and strong G band peak (1584 cm–1) associated with the breathing mode of aromatic rings because of
dangling bonds in plane terminations and bond stretching of the sp2 carbons, respectively. The degree of disorder (intensity
ratio, ID/IG) is found to increase after oxidation because of introduction of
oxidative functionalities in sp2 domains, consistent with
the literature.56 The ID/IG ratio is determined as
0.86 for the 10:0 and 0.6 for 0:10 samples treated with neat H2SO4 and H3PO4, respectively,
confirming that H2SO4 assisted in the formation
of holes and functional groups at defect sites, whereas H3PO4-treated graphite bears relatively more extended conjugated
structures.

Figure 6 (a) Raman spectra of graphite and synthesized GOs. (b) Zoomed-in
image of Raman spectra in the range of 2000–3500 cm–1 representing the intensity of 2D, D + G, and D′ bands, suggesting
the stacking order of graphite galleries in different oxidation levels.

With the addition of H3PO4 in H2SO4, the degree of defects
increased as indicated by the
increase in the ID/IG ratio and distance between defects (LD) (Table S5), suggesting an enhancement
in the introduction of defects across the GO because of effective
intercalation efficiency and oxidizing capacity of H3PO4 in conjunction with H2SO4. The calculated
average crystallite size (La) of the sp2 domains in the GOs is found to decrease from 148.4 nm in
precursor graphite to 22.5, 21.0, 21.3, and 17.0 nm for 10:0, 8:2,
5:5, and 2:8, respectively. This decrease in La supported the breaking of crystallites of graphite because
of oxidation and formation of defects, disorders, tetrahedral sp3structures, and crystalline domains, consequently generating
amorphous structures in GO. The changes in overtone bands, 2D, D +
G, and 2G bands (Figure 6b), illustrated the disruption of the graphitic AB stacking order
in graphite. In comparison to graphite, overtone bands are apparent,
confirming the disordered structure in GOs, with the increasing oxidation
level.54 The I2D/IG ratio in the case of 0:10 is similar
to that of graphite, supporting the existence of stacked nanostructures.

Figure 7 shows the
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of synthesized GOs, and the respective
mass losses are presented in Table S6.
Both 10:0 and 8:2 samples showed a three-step decomposition, whereas
higher H3PO4-treated ratios revealed a two-step
mass loss behavior (Figure 7b). The mass loss below 100 °C is due to adsorbed water,
that at ∼250 °C is due to loss of labile chemical functionalities
such as COOH, C–OH, and epoxides, and a higher mass loss at
≥400 °C is attributed to the degradation of more thermally
stable C=C, C=O, and complex functionalities in the
graphitic network.70 The % mass loss observed
at 250 °C followed the order of 0:10 < 2:8 < 10:0 <
8:2 ≈ 5:5, confirming the predominance of more labile functionalities
in the same fashion, which corroborated well with the XPS (Table S3). TGA data of 0:10 correlated well with
the presence of H3PO4 and organophosphates structures
as determined by XPS and FTIR studies. A mass loss of ∼7% at
∼154 °C (cf. boiling point of H3PO4) is indicative of physioadsorbed H3PO4 in
GO (Figure 6b). Interestingly,
a higher char yield (mass left after combustion) is also supportive
of the existence of more stable carbon architecture in 0:10 and 2:8
because of a lower degree of oxidation and the presence of phosphorus,
as the latter is known to promote carbonization with enhancement in
char yield.71

Figure 7 (a) TGA and (b) DTG analyses:
graphite and GOs synthesized by varying
acid ratios.

The effect of H3PO4 incorporation in synthesis
revealed a significant variation in the surface morphology of GO as
determined by SEM and TEM from Figures 8 and 9, respectively. The SEM
image of 10:0-treated GO exhibited excessive wrinkling, whereas 8:2
showed folding and bundling of the sheets. The 5:5 and 2:8 samples
revealed a relatively smooth surface morphology. The former ratio
showed the presence of nanostructural leafy domains, whereas the latter
ratio revealed a layered architecture. In the case of 0:10, aggregation
of particles with no regular sheet-type structure is observed. Elemental
mapping of 0:10 (Figure 8f) revealed a high percentage of carbon with homogeneous distribution
of phosphorus, supporting uniform entrapment of H3PO4 and formation of organophosphates across the interlayer spaces
within oxo-functionalized graphite sheets, in congruence with FTIR
and XPS analyses. The different morphology of GO prepared with variable
acid ratios is an indication of different extents of exfoliation,
sheet size, and agglomeration of layered structures.

area zone. Scale bar ∼10 μm.

Figure 9 TEM (a–e) images and inset of GO synthesized showing the
surface morphology at different resolutions; (f) SAED pattern of the
0:10 sample exhibiting the hexagonal pattern of crystalline domains.

In an analogy, TEM studies (Figure 9) also corroborated
well with SEM. The 10:0 sample
showed extensive wrinkling of the sheet than the 8:2 sample. In 5:5,
leafy domains are clearly visible with folding across, forming the
midrib and veins. A heterogeneity in 2:8 is indicative of the difference
in degree of oxidation, consistent with UV–vis (Figure S3) and FTIR (Figure S4) results. The 10:0 sample exhibited dense particulates and
the existence of graphitic domains as confirmed from selected area
electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. The SAED patterns for 10:0,
8:2, and 5:5 showed a typical diffusive ring-like motif because of
the merging of diffraction spots across several stacked GOs, indicating
the polycrystalline behavior of the samples (Figure S5).72 The diffused ring diffraction
pattern is typical of a disordered structure which is observed in
GO, illustrating the disruption of the conjugated structure of graphite
due to oxidation. The 2:8 sample showed a little predominance of diffraction
spots, which is attributed to the retention of graphene-like lattice
substances within the oxidized GO domains (Figure S5d).72 The existence of such graphitic
islands or unoxidized sp2 domains within the oxidized GO
sheets are substantially present as reported previously.73,74 The 0:10 sample showed a set of sixfold symmetric diffraction points
of a typical hexagonal configuration (Figure 9f), which could be attributed to the highest
formation of super-lattice-type ordered arrays because of a larger
amount of graphitic islands, as also supported by XRD and Raman analysis.

Additionally, AFM images (Figure S6)
supported sheet-like morphology and the existence of mono- and few-layered
structures in 8:2 and 5:5 samples, respectively. The 2:8 sample showed
a very high stacking order of ∼50 nm, which also supported
the formation of the layered structure.

The influence of various
oxygenated functionalities in GO is evaluated
with the help of zeta potential and DLS analysis (Figure 10). Zeta potential (ζ)
is necessary for characterizing the electrical properties of interfacial
layers in dispersion. The ζ values of synthesized GOs (Figure 10a) in an aqueous
dispersion using different ratios of intercalants, that is, 10:0,
8:2, 5:5, 2:8, and 0:10, are measured as −36, −34, −30,
−25, and −16 mV, respectively. A value of ζ ≥
30 (negative or positive) is considered to be stable for dispersions
because of higher inner-particle electrostatic repulsions originated
from ionization of labile groups. A greater ζ value for 10:0,
8:2, and 5:5 implies their higher stability in aqueous dispersion,
which is in congruence with UV–vis studies (Figure S2b). The ζ values are attributed to the development
of surface charges on nanomaterial because of their interaction with
water. The more ionizable groups that are present, such as hydroxyl,
phenolic-OH, and −COOH, with higher acid dissociation constants, Ka, are expected to dissociate rapidly to account
for higher ζ values of GO. Especially, −COOH and phenolic-OH
exhibit relatively easier dissociation because of stabilization of
the respective structures by resonance and polar interactions. A decrease
in the ζ value is revealed with a decrease in H2SO4 in the intercalant ratio, which is a reflection of simultaneous
decrease in negatively charged functionalities, as supported by XPS
data. In analogy to UV–vis and Raman results, 0:10 showed the
lowest ζ, attributable to the least stability of its aqueous
dispersion, which is consistent with their lowest density of polar
oxo-groups.

Figure 10 (a) Zeta potential, pH of respective dispersions (in parenthesis),
and (b) DLS of different as-obtained GOs in aqueous medium.

In addition, the sheet size, particle
size distribution, and colloidal
homogeneity of nanoparticles in aqueous media also supported the above
observations. The average hydrodynamic sizes of GOs obtained are observed
as 238, 456, 534, 2163, and 4865 nm for 10:0, 8:2, 5:5, 2:8, and 0:10
ratio, respectively (Figure 10b). The smaller size and larger ζ values accounted for
a higher colloidal stability and homogeneity for 10:0, 8:2, and 5:5
samples. A larger hydrodynamic size in the latter ratios (2:8 and
0:10) is due to less oxidized graphitic domains along with their relatively
larger sheet size, accounting for their moderate to lowest stability
in aqueous dispersions.

A qualitative knowledge on the nature
of functional groups (ionizable
and non-ionizable) (Figure S7) is determined
by pH analysis. The acidic −COOH and phenolic −OH groups
would react with basic NaOH instantaneously to undergo acid–base
neutralization reaction. Whereas carbonyl undergoes nucleophilic addition,
epoxide and organophosphates are expected to undergo base-mediated
ring opening reaction with NaOH. The control sample (aq. NaOH) showed
a pH of 9.7. Base-treated GO samples for 10:0, 8:2, 5:5, 2:8, and
0:10 showed a lowering in pH as a result of consumption of NaOH because
of their reaction with GO. A higher consumption of NaOH is observed
for 5:5, which is in accordance with the presence of the highest number
of base-reactive functional groups. Ideally, 2:8 and 0:10 should reflect
the lowest consumption of NaOH because of lower oxygenated functionalities
but entrapped H3PO4, and the existence of reactive
phosphorus structures in these samples accounted for a higher consumption
of NaOH.

The nature of functionalities, that is, hydrophilic
versus hydrophobic,
wettability of the underlying substrate,75,76 density of coating, and roughness, interplay and affect the CA of
water on graphene nanomaterial. To minimize the errors, GO samples
are coated at the same concentration on the same substrate with the
same volume to pursue the CA measurements. The synthesized GOs (Figure 11a) showed a lower
water drop CA than an unsupported graphene (∼90°),77 supporting their hydrophilic nature. The 10:0
and 0:10 showed a higher CA, whereas intermediate ratios exhibited
lowering in value, and the least value is observed for 5:5, inferring
the highest hydrophilicity and a comparatively smoother surface morphology,
consistent with SEM images. The optical images, inset of Figure 11a, of the samples
represent similar observations pertaining to roughness and hydrophilic
behavior of GOs.78

Figure 11 (a) CA and (b) UV–vis
spectra of the supernatant obtained
from MB-treated GO samples.

MB (methylthioninium chloride) is a cationic dye, which remained
a concern because it is an industrial pollutant in water bodies and
demands remedial measures for its removal. Previous reports showed
a promising behavior of GO in removal of MB dye.79 The potential of oxidative functionalities present on GOs
along with the π-framework is effective in removal of dye because
of both polar and π–π interactions. To observe
the effectiveness of GOs synthesized from different intercalant ratios,
aqueous GO dispersions at the same concentrations are used for MB
dye removal. The maximum at 660 nm because of MB species is found
to decrease with the type of GO used, signifying their potential in
MB removal (Figure 11b). The adsorption capacity of the dye on GO is directly proportional
to the oxygen functionalities present as they interact effectively
with positively charged MB dye via polar interactions. It can be seen
from the UV–vis spectra that the adsorption of MB by 10:0 is
maximum followed by 8:2 and other ratios. The least adsorption of
MB by 0:10 suggested the occurrence of least content of oxygen functionalities
on the surface of GO.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, using first-principles simulations and various measurements,
we successfully demonstrated the effect of variation in the ratio
of acid intercalants, namely, H2SO4 and H3PO4 in graphite. Understanding the variable intercalation
behavior of the two acids, we synthesized GO using various ratios
of H2SO4 and H3PO4 in
the presence of KMnO4 to mediate the oxidation of graphite.
Both H2SO4 and H3PO4 are
found to control the exfoliation and oxidation of graphite sheets.
H3PO4 is highly effective in exfoliation of
layers of graphite, whereas H2SO4 simultaneously
controls the extent of oxidation of GO sheets too. Neat H2SO4 led to formation of oxygen-rich functionalities, whereas
neat H3PO4 led to mild oxidation of graphite.
The nature and amount of functionalities generated on the GO surface
are primarily governed by the ratio of 2. An equivolume ratio of acids
led to an enhancement in oxygenated functionalities at the basal plane.
The current work suggests that the alteration in the ratio of acids
is effective in tailoring the functionality in GOs, thereby advancing
their scope for electronic and/or biomedical applications.
