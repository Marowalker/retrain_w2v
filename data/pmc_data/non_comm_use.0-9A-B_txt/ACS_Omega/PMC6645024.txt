Visible-light-responsive
photocatalysts used in the highly efficient
hydrogen production exhibit several disadvantages such as photocorrosion
and fast recombination. Because of the potential important applications
of such catalysts, it is crucial that a simple, effective solution
is developed. In this respect, in this study, we combined SiC (β
modification) and TiO2 with CdS to overcome the challenges
of photocorrosion and fast recombination of CdS. Notably, we found
that when irradiated with visible light, CdS was excited, and the
excited electrons moved to the conduction band of TiO2,
thereby increasing the efficiency of charge separation. In addition,
by moving the holes generated on CdS to the valence band of SiC, in
the opposite direction of TiO2, photocorrosion and fast
recombination were prevented. As a result, in the sulfide solution,
the CdS/SiC composite catalyst exhibited 4.3 times higher hydrogen
generation ability than pure CdS. Moreover, this effect was enhanced
with the addition of TiO2, giving 10.8 times higher hydrogen
generation ability for the CdS/SiC/TiO2 catalyst. Notably,
the most efficient catalyst, which was obtained by depositing Pt as
a cocatalyst, exhibited 1.09 mmol g–1 h–1 hydrogen generation ability and an apparent quantum yield of 24.8%.
Because water reduction proceeded on the TiO2 surface and
oxidative sulfide decomposition proceeded on the SiC surface, the
exposure of CdS to the solution was unnecessary, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy confirmed that photocorrosion was successfully suppressed.
Thus, we believe that the effective composite photocatalyst construction
method presented herein can also be applied to other visible-light-responsive
powder photocatalysts having the same disadvantages as CdS, thereby
improving the efficiency of such catalysts.

1 Introduction
Because
of the fast population increase and technology development
experienced nowadays, energy usage is constantly rising.1 Currently, the main source of energy is fossil
fuels, the excessive use of which causes various problems such as
energy exhaustion, global warming, and environmental pollution.2−5 Therefore, it is crucial to develop a method to generate renewable
energy that does not emit pollutants and carbon dioxide.6−8 In addition, the formation of hydrogen sulfide is a local problem
arising in places such as volcanic zones, geothermal power plants,
and oil-refining plants.9,10 At present, the main
desulfurizing processing method is the Claus process, which includes
multiple steps and intense conditions.11,12 Therefore,
a novel method that employs simpler and milder conditions is required.

In this respect, we propose the use of photocatalytic hydrogen
generation and hydrogen sulfide decomposition. A photocatalytic reaction
that proceeds under sunlight is very attractive13,14 because it can generate hydrogen, which has drawn significant attention
as a clean energy source.15,16 To achieve an efficient
photocatalytic reaction, it is required to utilize not only ultraviolet
light with high energy but also visible light.17,18 Therefore, we considered the use of cadmium sulfide, which has a
strong reducing power and visible light responsiveness.19−21 However, cadmium sulfide (CdS) exhibits several disadvantages such
as fast recombination due to a narrow band gap and photocorrosion
by the shallow valence band (VB) position.22−24 As a possible
solution to the recombination issue, it has been reported that by
combining CdS with TiO2, excited electrons generated on
CdS move onto TiO2, thereby increasing the efficiency of
charge separation and improving the hydrogen generation ability.25,26 However, in the system employed in these studies, TiO2 has been used as an acceptor that only receives electrons, which
eventually leads to lack of separation of the holes on CdS. In addition,
reports have indicated the suppression of photocorrosion using graphene
sheets or shells of specific materials, such as K2[CdFe(CN)6] or SiO2.27−30 However, in these cases, it is possible that the
charge transfer in the sheet or the shell slows down the reaction.
Furthermore, these methods require complete surface coverage and morphology
control. Therefore, simpler approaches for the suppression of photocorrosion
are needed.

Thus, in this work, we have combined SiC and TiO2 with
CdS in an effort to overcome the fast recombination and photocorrosion
challenges. SiC is a stable photocatalyst, which contains no heavy
metals and has attracted an increasing amount of attention in the
recent years for its use in semiconductor devices.31,32 In addition, TiO2, the most well-known photocatalyst,
is a stable and inexpensive material with a conduction band (CB) position
suitable for hydrogen production.33Figure 1 displays the schematic
illustration of hydrogen evolution with the photocatalyst prepared
in this study, in which SiC acted as a sink for the photogenerated
holes on CdS. Indeed, there are studies, which have reported on the
improvement in efficiency by constructing a cascadal band position
with three kinds of composite semiconductors using an electrode system
and a sheet-type semiconductor.33−35 However, to the best of our knowledge,
there is still no report on the construction of powders in semiconductors
and on the enhancement of the efficiency by a triple composite photocatalyst.
Using this novel photocatalyst, which should improve the separation
of holes and electrons, we have previously significantly improved
the amount of hydrogen production and H2S resolution, which
was confirmed by Na2S decomposition.36,37 Recently, we also reported that the hydrogen production ability
of CdS is improved by the addition of SiC and TiO2.38

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the hydrogen evolution and sulfide
decomposition
mechanisms of the CdS/SiC/TiO2 composite photocatalyst.

Herein, we build on our previous
findings and deepen the understanding
of the catalyst system by performing further characterizations using
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS),
eventually achieving more accurate optimization and an improved synthesis.
Furthermore, by evaluating the activity using monochromatic light,
the wavelength dependence and apparent quantum yield were determined.
Moreover, the reaction scheme of the SiC composite photocatalyst was
discussed in detail, with a focus on the movement of the hole to the
VB of SiC. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of the most efficient
photocatalyst tested herein was found to be 1090 μmol h–1 g–1, and the apparent quantum yield
was 24.8%.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 XRD Patterns
of the Prepared Photocatalysts
Figure 2 displays
the XRD patterns of the prepared CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1) composite
photocatalyst and the respective pure materials. The characteristic
diffraction peaks of CdS were detected at 2θ angles of 26.6°,
43.9°, and 52.1°, which can be indexed to the (111), (220),
and (311) crystal planes, respectively, of β-CdS (cubic) (JCPDS
PDF no. 04-006-3897). In the case of SiC, the characteristic peaks
found at 2θ angles of 35.6° and 41.3° were indexed
to the (111) and (200) crystal planes, respectively, of β-SiC
(cubic) (JCPDS PDF no. 00-029-1129). However, very small peaks from
hexagonal SiC appeared at 33.6° and 37.9° and corresponded
to the (101) and (103) crystal planes, respectively, of α-SiC
(hexagonal) (JCPDS PDF no. 00-022-1273). In the case of TiO2, the diffraction peaks detected at 2θ angles of 25.3°,
37.9°, 48.0°, 54.2°, and 54.8° were indexed to
the (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) crystal planes, respectively,
of tetragonal anatase TiO2 (JCPDS PDF no. 00-064-0863).
Considering the peaks of the CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1) composite
photocatalyst and corresponding pure materials, it can be assumed
that the prepared composites consist of β-CdS, β-SiC,
and TiO2. Furthermore, the peak detected at 28.2°
suggested that a small part of anatase TiO2 was transferred
to rutile TiO2.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of the CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1)
composite and
the respective pure materials.

The XRD patterns for the CdS/SiC composite photocatalysts
with
different composite ratios are shown in Figure S1. As can be observed, the proportion of CdS increased with
the weakening of the peak intensity of SiC. In addition, because the
CdS peak appeared rather wide, it was assumed that the crystallite
size was larger than that of SiC. Moreover, from the XRD patterns
of the photocatalysts in combination with TiO2 (Figures S2 and S3), it can be seen that the peak
intensity changes according to the composite ratio. However, in the
case of the TiO2 composite, a crystal transition took place,
as shown in Figure 2, because of the sintering operation, and crystallites grew, thereby
making the CdS peak sharp. The same tendency was observed also in
the case of the CdS/TiO2 composite, which did not contain
SiC (Figure S4).

2.2 Ultraviolet–Visible
DRS
DRS
spectra of the prepared composites and the respective pure materials
are shown in Figure 3. The absorbance of each composite was a combination of the absorbances
of the individual pure materials. The band gap and absorption edge
of each pure material were estimated by extrapolation from the intersection
of the slope and the flattened line of the spectra (Figures S5–S7). The calculated band gaps of CdS, SiC,
and TiO2 were found to be 2.12, 2.52, and 3.23 eV, respectively,
from which the absorption edges were calculated to be 587, 494, and
385 nm, respectively. Figure 3 shows that SiC absorbs at a wavelength longer than 494 nm,
which does not contribute to the reaction characteristics for the
indirect band gap.40 Therefore, the band
gap of the main absorption between the VB and the CB was found to
be 2.52 eV. In the photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiment,
a light source with a wavelength longer than 420 nm was employed to
confirm that there was no photoexcitation on TiO2, and
the main charge separation was performed on the CdS photocatalyst.

Figure 3 Diffuse
reflection spectra of the CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1)
composite and the respective pure materials.

DRS spectra with different composite ratios are shown in Figures S5–S8. When SiC was included in
the composite, the CdS absorption became weaker with the increasing
proportion of SiC (Figure S8). Similarly,
in the case of TiO2, the absorption of CdS and SiC became
weaker as the proportion of TiO2 increased (Figure S9–S11).

2.3 Fluorescence
Spectroscopy Analysis
From the fluorescence spectra displayed
in Figure 4, it can
be seen that the CdS fluorescence
appearing from 510 to 550 nm was quenched by the presence of SiC or
TiO2 in the composite. The quenching due to the presence
of TiO2 suggests that the electrons excited by CdS were
transferred to the CB of TiO2 (Figure 1).37 By contrast,
the quenching due to the presence of SiC indicates that the hole generated
in CdS moved to the VB of SiC.17,39 We concluded that the
electrons and holes were inactivated after the transfer because of
nonradiative inactivation.32

CdS/TiO2 (1:1), and CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1) composite
photocatalysts.

2.4 Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) Images
and Models of the Prepared Photocatalysts
Figure 5 displays the TEM images of
the prepared composite photocatalysts and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the CdS/SiC/TiO2 composite
(1:1:1, containing 1 wt % Pt). The TEM image of pure CdS (Figure 5a) clearly showed
an agglomeration of fine particles of about 5–20 nm. After
compositing with SiC (Figure 5b), the fine CdS particles with a diameter of about 5–20
nm were deposited on the SiC nanoparticles with a size of about 50–200
nm, thereby indicating that there was no change in the particle size
of CdS before and after the composite formation. The TEM image of
CdS/SiC/TiO2 shows fine TiO2 particles with
a size of about 5–20 nm on the CdS/SiC photocatalyst (Figure 5c). Furthermore,
the TEM and EDS mapping images of the CdS/SiC/TiO2 composite
loaded with Pt (Figure 5d) indicated that CdS dispersed through SiC in the core and subsequently
precipitated and that TiO2 was composited in a way that
it partly covered the CdS/SiC composite.

Figure 5 TEM and EDS mapping images

Pure CdS, (b) CdS/SiC (1:1), (c) CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1),
and (d) CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1) after loading with 1 wt %
Pt.

We concluded that a part of the
Pt is distributed around SiC, most
specifically around CdS, because of the use of a visible-light-induced
(λ > 420 nm) photodeposition method, with CdS absorbing most
of the irradiated light. However, as TiO2 was composited
to cover CdS, the area where TiO2 was present was considered
to have received electrons from CdS (Figure 1), leading to the precipitation of Pt. In
other words, although the distribution of Pt depended on the position
of CdS, Pt was deposited on the TiO2 surface because of
electron transfer from CdS, which occurred in the area covered with
TiO2. Another important observation from the TEM images
was that, in all composite forms, the SiC surface was partially exposed.
Considering the photocatalytic reaction occurring on the prepared
composite photocatalyst, we concluded that it would be necessary to
expose the SiC surface because the oxidation reaction proceeds on
SiC.

2.5 Photocatalytic Activity
Figure 6 presents the relationship
between the photocatalyst combination ratio and the hydrogen production
amount. As can be seen, the most effective combination ratio was that
of the CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1) composite photocatalyst. Generally,
it was found that when either SiC or TiO2 was combined
with CdS, the amount of hydrogen generation increased. Furthermore,
when both were present in the composite, a further improvement of
the hydrogen production amount was observed. However, an excessive
amount of SiC caused weakening of the CdS absorption and a decrease
in the amount of hydrogen production (Figure S8). By contrast, deficient SiC led to insufficient transfer of holes
generated on CdS and poor SiC surface exposure where the oxidation
reaction takes place, thereby reducing the hydrogen generation efficiency.
Moreover, an excessive amount of TiO2 also caused decreased
hydrogen generation efficiency because of the weak CdS absorption
and the relatively smaller SiC surface on which the oxidation reaction
can proceed (Figures S9–S11). By
contrast, an insufficient composite amount of TiO2 caused
the separation of excited electrons to become deficient and the efficiency
of charge separation to decrease. Therefore, the visible-light absorption
was mainly carried out by CdS, whereas the oxidation and reduction
reactions proceeded on the SiC and TiO2 surfaces, respectively,
because of the carrier movement.

of SiC and TiO2 to CdS and the rate of hydrogen generation
[orange, pure CdS; blue,
CdS/SiC 1:1 composite; yellow, CdS/TiO2 (1:1) composite;
green, CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1:1) composite].

To examine the improvement of efficiency in greater
detail, the
cocatalyst was deposited on the main composite, and the action spectra
were recorded. Table 1 shows the hydrogen production rates obtained using the synthesized
composite photocatalysts: pure CdS, CdS/TiO2 (1:1), CdS/SiC
(1:1), and CdS/SiC/TiO2 (1:1), both with and without the
Pt cocatalyst. We found that the CdS/TiO2 (1:1) composite
exhibited 5.6 times higher hydrogen evolution rate (85.2 μmol
h–1 g–1) than pure CdS. This improvement
was due to transfer of excited electrons from CdS to the CB of TiO2, thereby preventing recombination on CdS and increasing the
efficiency of charge separation.40−42 This assumption was
supported by the photoluminescence spectra shown in Figure 4.

CdS/SiC	65.6	467.1	7.1 times	
CdS/SiC/TiO2	165.1	1090.4	6.6 times	
For CdS/SiC, considering the relative positions of
the CdS and
SiC bands,43,44 we can conclude that efficiency
improvement was caused by the transfer of holes generated on CdS to
the VB of SiC. Therefore, the CdS/SiC composite exhibited hydrogen
generation ability of 65.6 μmol g–1 h–1, which is 4.3 times higher than that of pure CdS.
However, Figure 3 shows
that because SiC has absorption of 494 nm, efficiency may also be
improved by the influence of electrons excited by SiC. This assumption
is supported by the action spectra of CdS and CdS/SiC (Figure 7), which show that although
no SiC excitation occurred at wavelengths of λ = 500 and 540
nm, the efficiency of CdS/SiC was improved compared to that of pure
CdS. On the basis of this observation, we concluded that the hole
transfer to SiC VB was responsible for improving the efficiency of
hydrogen evolution.

Figure 7 Photoresponse of the prepared composite photocatalysts
and pure
CdS.

On the basis of the above observations,
we proposed two possible
mechanisms for hydrogen evolution and sulfide decomposition: one that
includes SiC excitation (Figure 8a) and the other occurring in a wavelength region that
does not excite SiC (Figure 8b). The hydrogen generation ability can be explained not only
by SiC excitation but also by the fact that holes tend to move to
more stable band positions. Because SiC is an n-type semiconductor,45 holes cannot move in SiC. However, when the
substance to be oxidized approaches within the effective particle
diameter of holes present on SiC, the reaction can proceed. Thus,
the CdS/SiC/TiO2 photocatalyst clearly showed higher activity
in terms of hydrogen production ability and quantum yield than the
other two kinds of composites shown in Figures 7 and 8 because the
carriers moved in the opposite direction, as the destination for electron
transfer was the CB of TiO2 and that for hole transfer
was the VB of SiC (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Schematic illustration of the hydrogen evolution and sulfide decomposition
mechanisms using the CdS/SiC/TiO2 composite photocatalyst
with the Pt cocatalyst. (a) Reaction in the wavelength region where
SiC electrons are excited. (b) Reaction in the wavelength region where
there is no absorption by SiC.

For the photocatalysts after Pt deposition, the hydrogen
generation
ability was the same as that before Pt deposition, improved with the
combination of TiO2 and SiC, and further improved upon
formation of a tricomposite photocatalyst. However, after Pt deposition,
the photocatalysts, in which TiO2 was composited, showed
smaller improvement than the ones that did not contain TiO2. Although Pt acts as an electron acceptor, promotes charge separation,
and lowers overvoltage, it is assumed that such a tendency was obtained
because charge separation promotion induced by Pt was the same as
that of TiO2. The most efficient CdS/SiC/TiO2 composite photocatalyst with the Pt cocatalyst exhibited hydrogen
generation ability of 1090.4 μmol g–1 h–1, which is 7.4 times higher than that of pure CdS
with the Pt cocatalyst. In addition, the apparent quantum yield of
this composite reached 24.8% at 420 nm. Furthermore, the action spectra
reveal that the apparent quantum yields of all composite photocatalysts
reached 0% at 580 nm, indicating that hydrogen was produced by the
excited electrons produced by absorption of CdS, whereas the absorption
derived from the indirect band gap of SiC was not used to excite electrons.

2.6 Photocorrosion Suppression
In the
synthesized photocatalysts, CdS was sandwiched between SiC and TiO2, thereby reducing CdS exposure, which enabled suppression
of photocorrosion and recombination between the CB of TiO2 and VB of SiC. To confirm the stability of the composite photocatalyst,
a hydrogen production experiment was conducted for 24 h using the
most efficient composite photocatalyst (CdS/SiC/TiO2 1:1:1
with Pt 1 wt %). Figure 9 shows the relationship between the hydrogen evolution amount and
the reaction time. The presence of a sacrificial reagent in the experiment
confirmed that the hydrogen production rate remained constant.

Figure 9 Amount of evolved
hydrogen as a function of time for the most efficient
CdS/SiC/TiO2–Pt composite photocatalyst.

The stability of the photocatalyst in pure water
and the extent
of photocorrosion suppression were examined by visible-light irradiation
(λ > 420 nm). Hydrogen was not detected from the reaction
using
either photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation, probably due
to both kinetic and thermodynamic factors. In particular, the VBs
of CdS and SiC were shallower than those of the oxide photocatalysts,
which weakened the driving force. Furthermore, as the potential could
not reach that of the oxygen generation reaction proceeding with two
electrons, the holes were not consumed and no hydrogen evolution occurred.
In addition, although the generally assumed oxygen generation reaction
proceeded with four-electron oxidation, which explains the VB position
of CdS and SiC from the thermodynamic viewpoint, the reaction did
not proceed probably because the electrons were inactivated before
storing the four excitation electrons, owing to the insufficient intensity
of the irradiation light.46

The X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the photocatalysts
used in this experiment were obtained before and after light irradiation,
and the XPS peaks of elemental sulfur are shown in Figure 10. The photocatalyst before
use showed a peak corresponding to S2– in the bound
state (Figure 10a)
and a peak derived from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2. By
contrast, the sulfur peak of pure CdS after use shifted to the higher
energy side (Figure 10b), indicating that S2– was oxidized by light irradiation,
thereby leading to the precipitation of single sulfur (S0).47 However, for the CdS/SiC/TiO2 composite photocatalyst, no such shift was observed because
of the elution suppression due to reduced CdS exposure and carrier
transport to SiC, such that the generated holes on CdS were no longer
used for photocorrosion.

use for hydrogen
production, and (b) pure CdS and (c) the CdS/SiC/TiO2 composite
photocatalyst after use.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we successfully
improved the efficiency of the hydrogen
generation reaction accompanied by sulfide decomposition by compositing
SiC and TiO2 with CdS. The most efficient catalyst, which
was obtained after depositing Pt as a cocatalyst, achieved 50 times
higher hydrogen production rate than pure CdS and 24.8% apparent quantum
yield using a 420 nm light source. In this photocatalytic reaction,
electrons excited on CdS were separated into the CB of TiO2, and the generated holes were separated into the VB of SiC. Moreover,
via this cascadal carrier transport, fast recombination of CdS and
photocorrosion was successfully suppressed. All in all, we believe
that the photocatalyst construction presented in this study can also
be applied to other visible-light-responsive photocatalysts and expect
that similar efficiency improvement and photocorrosion suppression
would be observed.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The synthesis of the photocatalysts
was carried out according to a previously reported simple two-step
method.38 The CdS/SiC nanocomposites were
prepared via a facile wet chemistry approach. A requisite amount of
SiC powder (β modification, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) was dispersed in 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH ethanol solution
and mechanically stirred for 1 h. Then, 3.08 g of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo,
Japan) was fully dissolved in ethanol (100 mL) and added to the SiC
dispersed mixture. The resulting suspension of SiC and cadmium ions
was mechanically stirred for 1 h. Thereafter, 20 mL of an aqueous
solution containing 2.4 g Na2S·9H2O (Wako
Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was added dropwise to
the aforementioned mixture, and the agitation was continued for 1
h. The formed composite powder was filtered, washed with pure ethanol
and ultrapure water, and dried at 353 K for 24 h.

The CdS/SiC/TiO2 composites were synthesized via a sol–gel process
at room temperature through the hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide
(Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan) in the presence of the CdS/SiC
composite. First, the CdS/SiC powder was dispersed in 100 mL of isopropanol
and stirred for 30 min. Then, the required amount of titanium isopropoxide
was added dropwise, and the suspension was stirred for another 30
min. Pure H2O was subsequently added dropwise, and the
resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h. The prepared composite powder
was filtered, dried, and calcined at 673 K for 2 h under air flow
to increase the crystallinity of TiO2. Composites with
different molar ratios were fabricated according to this method by
adjusting the amounts of SiC powder and titanium isopropoxide used.
For comparison, CdS alone was prepared via a similar method, which
excluded the addition of SiC. In this approach, 1 wt % Pt was deposited
on the composite photocatalysts using H2PtCl6·6H2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan) through
a photodeposition method under visible light (λ > 420 nm)
in
methanol solution.

The synthesized composite photocatalysts
were characterized by
XRD (sample horizontal type multipurpose X-ray diffractometer, Ultima
IV, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan), DRS (U-3900/3900H spectrophotometer, Hitachi
High-Tech Science, Tokyo, Japan), fluorescence spectroscopy (FP-6600
fluorophotometer, JASCO, Tokyo, Japan), TEM/EDS analysis (EM-002BF,
Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), and XPS analysis (JPS-9010MC, Mg anode, JEOL
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).

4.2 Photocatalytic Reactions
Photocatalytic
experiments were conducted in a gas-closed circulation system equipped
with a vacuum line. Each photocatalyst sample (0.4 g) was suspended
in 240 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.1 M sodium sulfite and
sodium sulfide. A 300 W Xe lamp (Lamp House R300-3J) with an ultraviolet
(UV) cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as a visible-light
source. A 3 mL aliquot of the evolved gas was collected through a
gas-sampling port that was directly connected to a gas chromatograph
(GC-8A Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). A Xe lamp with band-pass filters (λ
= 420, 460, 500, 540, and 580 nm, Asahi Spectra, Tokyo, Japan) was
employed in the determination of the apparent quantum yield, which
was calculated according to eq 1(48) 1  

The number of incident photons was
measured using a silicon photodiode detector (S1337-1010BQ, Bunkoukeiki
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and the number of reacted electrons was
calculated from the evolved hydrogen.

4.3 Durability
Evaluation
To confirm
the photocorrosion suppression, we conducted light irradiation experiments
in pure water. Each photocatalyst sample (0.03 g) was suspended in
a 23 mL vial bottle containing 15 mL of pure water, followed by degassing
the reaction mixture by Ar bubbling. A 300 W Xe lamp with an UV cutoff
filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the visible-light source.
A
0.1 mL aliquot of the evolved gas was collected by a gas-tight syringe
and then injected into the gas chromatograph for analysis of the generated
gas. XPS analysis was performed on the photocatalyst both before and
after light irradiation.
