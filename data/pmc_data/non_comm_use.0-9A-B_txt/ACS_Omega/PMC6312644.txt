The
activity of a host of antimicrobial peptides has been examined
against a range of lipid bilayers mimicking bacterial and eukaryotic
membranes. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms and the nature of
the physicochemical properties underlying the peptide–lipid
interactions that lead to membrane disruption are yet to be fully
elucidated. In this study, the interaction of the short antimicrobial
peptide aurein 1.2 was examined in the presence of an anionic cardiolipin-containing
lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulations. Aurein 1.2 is
known to interact strongly with anionic lipid membranes. In the simulations,
the binding of aurein 1.2 was associated with buckling of the lipid
bilayer, the degree of which varied with the peptide concentration.
The simulations suggest that the intrinsic properties of cardiolipin,
especially the fact that it promotes negative membrane curvature,
may help protect membranes against the action of peptides such as
aurein 1.2 by counteracting the tendency of the peptide to induce
positive curvature in target membranes.

1 Introduction
Whenever pathogens are
exposed to antibiotic agents, resistance
can develop. Indeed, resistance to antibiotic agents that are used
clinically has become a global public health problem.1 Membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptides have, however,
remained effective against bacteria on an evolutionary timescale and
thus have the potential to form the basis of a new class of therapeutics.2 These relatively small peptides are found throughout
the animal and plant kingdoms and are vital components of the defense
systems of complex multicellular organisms.2 Membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptides bind to the surface of
microbial membranes and beyond a threshold concentration, induce the
formation of transmembrane pores, or otherwise destabilize the membrane.
The skin secretions of many amphibians are rich in such peptides.
In particular, Australian tree frogs of the genus Litoria secrete a series of pore-forming or membrane-disrupting antimicrobial
peptides that are in general active against both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria.3,4 Amongst them is the peptide aurein
1.2. Aurein 1.2 has 13 amino acids and a net charge of +1e at neutral pH. It is unstructured in aqueous solution but folds
into an α-helix upon binding to model membranes.5−8 Aurein 1.2 is the smallest amphibian peptide to show antibiotic
and anticancer activity.3 Because aurein
1.2 is too short to span a lipid bilayer but is membrane-lytic, it
has been generally considered to operate via the so-called “carpet”
mechanism whereby the peptide destabilizes membranes in a detergent-like
manner leading to micellization. This has been supported by a range
of studies, including vesicle leakage experiments followed by fluorescence
spectroscopy,9,10 solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,7,10 neutron reflectometry,10 quartz crystal microbalance,10−13 and dual polarization interferometry14,15 experiments. Collectively, these experiments show strong interaction
between aurein 1.2 and lipid headgroups prior to a rapid aggregation-driven
micellization of lipid bilayers beyond a threshold peptide concentration
that is itself a function of the lipid composition. Coarse-grained
simulations of aurein 1.2 with zwitterionic and anionic lipid bilayers
have also suggested that aurein 1.2 might form pore-like structures.16,17

The membrane-binding properties of aurein 1.2 have been extensively
examined experimentally using a wide range of zwitterionic (phosphatidylcholine
and phosphatidylethanolamine) and anionic (phosphatidylglycerol) lipid
bilayers.6,11,13,18−20 Overall, aurein 1.2 appears to
interact preferentially with anionic lipids, probably because of its
cationic nature.6,21 For example, the effect of aurein
1.2 on the thermotropic phase behavior of a series of phospholipid
bilayers, including 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DMPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine,
and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol
(DMPG) bilayers, has been investigated using differential scanning
calorimetry. The greatest effect was with a DMPG bilayer, suggesting
strong interactions between aurein 1.2 and DMPG.6 Similarly, mixed DMPC/DMPG bilayers have been found to
be more sensitive to lysis by aurein 1.2 than pure DMPC bilayers.10,11,15 This preferential interplay with
anionic lipid bilayers is consistent with the antibiotic and anticancer
activity of aurein 1.2, as anionic lipids are commonly found in the
outer membrane leaflet of both bacterial and cancer cells.22−24 However, despite strong interactions of aurein 1.2 with membranes
containing anionic lipids, aurein 1.2 is not very potent against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
aureus or lipid bilayers consisting of either an E. coli lipid extract or lipids mimicking the composition
of a S. aureus membrane.8,14,25 Both these bacteria contain significant
amounts of the anionic lipid cardiolipin. Cardiolipin is a vital component
of membranes in which electron transport and phosphorylation are coupled,
namely, bacterial plasma membranes, chromatophores, chloroplasts,
and mitochondria. It has a unique “double-lipid” structure
in which two 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-phosphate groups are connected by
a central glycerol moiety. The quadruple-chain structure of cardiolipin
leads to a high degree of cohesion in the interfacial region of a
cardiolipin-containing bilayer and results in an increase in the structural
integrity of the bilayer.26 Although this
might explain why membranes containing cardiolipins appear to be less
sensitive to the effects of some antimicrobial peptides and antibiotics
than are membranes containing other anionic lipids,26−29 the precise molecular basis for
this finding is still unclear.

In this study, the interaction
of aurein 1.2 with model membranes
containing cardiolipin was investigated using atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations. The effect of varying amounts of peptide over
a range of temperatures was simulated in order to examine the potential
role played by cardiolipin in maintaining the integrity of the membranes.

2 Theoretical Methods
2.1 Simulation Systems
Aurein 1.2 (GLFDI
IKKIA ESF-NH2) is a cationic, 13-residue, C-amidated peptide with a net charge of +1e under
physiological conditions. Like in a number of other tree frog antimicrobial
peptides, the C-terminus of aurein 1.2 is amidated,
which is essential for its antimicrobial and anticancer activity.30 The initial structure of aurein 1.2 was built
as an ideal α-helix using PyMOL.31 The behavior of aurein 1.2 was investigated in a range of systems,
as detailed in Table 1. In the first system (system A), the structure of a single aurein
1.2 molecule was examined in an aqueous environment. In system B,
one copy of aurein 1.2 was simulated in the presence of a mixed cardiolipin/phosphatidylglycerol
bilayer. The peptide was initially placed in the water phase. The
102-lipid bilayer consisted of a mixture of phosphatidylglycerol lipids
(namely, POPG, 2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol)
with 25 mol % of cardiolipin (TOCL, 1,1′,2,2′-tetraoleoylcardiolipin),
corresponding to 76 POPG molecules with 26 TOCL molecules. The phosphatidylglycerol
component of the bilayer was a racemic mixture of 2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-(1-glycerol) (l-POPG) and 2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-d-(1-glycerol) (d-POPG). The lipids cardiolipin and
phosphatidylglycerol are present in a broad range of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacterial membranes but tend to be found in higher
concentrations in Gram-positive bacteria. The 3:1 POPG/TOCL bilayer
composition used in this study was designed to mimic a Gram-positive
bacterial membrane. The relative phosphatidylglycerol-to-cardiolipin
ratio can vary greatly amongst bacteria (about 1:1 in S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2.5:1 in Bacillus cereus, and 18:1
in Bacillus subtilis).24,32 The cardiolipin content in membranes also changes in space (cardiolipin-enriched
domains) and time (stage in the life cycle).24,33,34 Furthermore, bacteria can contain significant
amounts of O-aminoacylated glycerophospholipids,
especially O-(l-lysyl)phosphatidylglycerol
lipids in S. aureus.35,36 Although O-(l-lysyl)phosphatidylglycerol
lipids have been shown to promote resistance to antibiotics and cationic
antimicrobial peptides in S. aureus(37,38) and other bacteria39,40 by changing
the overall charge of the membrane surface, its protective effect
has been primarily ascribed to a stabilization of the membrane, thereby
hampering disruption or perturbation of the membrane induced by antibiotics
and cationic antimicrobial peptides. O-(l-Lysyl)phosphatidylglycerol lipids would then have only a minimal
effect on the binding of antibiotics and cationic antimicrobial peptides
to the membrane.35,41,42 Therefore, although the lipid composition used in the simulations
did not include O-(l-lysyl)phosphatidylglycerol,
this is not expected to affect the binding of aurein 1.2 onto the
mixed POPG/TOCL bilayer. The initial configuration of the bilayer
was constructed using PACKMOL43 and equilibrated
for 56 ns before the addition of a peptide. Cl– and
Na+ counterions were included to neutralize each charge
in the systems. All systems comprised sufficient water molecules to
ensure a fully hydrated state.

b The time in brackets for simulations
D1–D4 indicates the simulation time for the particular systems
excluding the cumulated time over previous simulations.

c The peptides were either left free
to bind to either leaflet of the lipid bilayer or allowed to bind
to only one of the two leaflets by position-restraining a layer of
water molecules between the peptides and the periodic image of the
lipid bilayer along z, thereby stopping the peptides
from diffusing freely to the other leaflet.

d D1 corresponds to the first 20 ns
of C1.

Systems A and B were
simulated three times each starting with different
initial velocities. Each simulation was 100 ns in length. In the case
of system B, the initial configuration of aurein 1.2 was taken from
one of the simulations of system A. Systems C and D contained larger
numbers of aurein 1.2. In order to accommodate the larger number of
peptides, the TOCL/POPG bilayer was duplicated along the x and y axes (the two directions defining the plane
of the bilayer), resulting in a bilayer of 408 lipids.

In systems
C1, C2, and C3, 10 peptides are bound to the same leaflet
of the bilayer. Simulations were performed at three different temperatures:
298, 318, and 338 K corresponding to systems C1, C2, and C3, respectively.
At the start of the simulations, the peptides were placed in the water
phase. To ensure all peptides were bound to the same leaflet, the
positions of a layer of water molecules were restrained by applying
a harmonic potential to each water oxygen with a force constant of
100 kJ mol–1 nm–2 to make a barrier,
preventing the diffusion of peptides toward the other leaflet. The
peptides were placed between this barrier and the bilayer surface.
The position restraints on the water molecules were removed once all
peptides were bound to the bilayer surface. In systems C4 and C5,
20 copies of aurein 1.2 were placed in the water phase. In these cases,
the peptide was free to bind to either of the two leaflets of the
lipid bilayer. The simulations were performed at 298 K (system C4)
and 338 K (system C5).

In D, the number of peptides was progressively
increased from 10
(system D1) to 40 (system D4). System D1 consisted of the first 20
ns of simulation of system C1. After 20 ns, five peptides were added
to system D1, leading to system D2 (15 peptides). After another 55
ns, a further 15 peptides were added to yield system D3 (30 peptides).
Then, after 25 ns, 10 more peptides were added to give system D4 (40
peptides). Systems D3 and D4 were simulated for 25 and 100 ns, respectively.
The cumulated simulation time over systems D1, D2, D3, and D4 was
200 ns. The peptides in D1 to D4 were restricted to binding only to
one leaflet by using a layer of position-restrained water molecules
as described previously. Note, in systems C and D, the level of hydration
corresponded to 70–100 water molecules per lipid. The configuration
of each extra copy of aurein 1.2 was selected randomly from the simulation
of aurein 1.2 in water (system A). The secondary structure was a mixture
of partially α-helical and nonhelical structures.

Finally,
two systems (E1 and E2) were derived from snapshots of
the simulation of systems D1 (E1) and D2 (E2) at 20 and 60 ns, respectively.
These times correspond to the cumulated time over systems D1 and D2.
All copies of the peptide were removed. Position restraints were applied
to all nonwater atoms, and the system progressively relaxed by gradually
decreasing the force constant from 500 kJ mol–1 nm–2 to 0 over 5 ns. Systems E1 and E2 were then simulated
for 40 ns.

Experimentally, vesicle leakage has been observed
for peptide-to-lipid
ratios (P/L) in the range of 1:100
to 1:5 for phosphatidylcholine and mixed phosphatidylcholine/phopshatidylglycerol
vesicles.9,10 Given that P/L ranged from 1:100 to 1:10 in systems B, C, and D, the peptide concentrations
used was favorable for membrane disruption to occur in the simulations.
Note, aurein 1.2 has been shown to inhibit the growth of a range of
Gram-positive bacterial strains at concentrations within 1–100
μg mL–1.8,44,45 Variations in these concentrations between bacterial genera and
strains may be due to specific membrane or cell wall components promoting
or hindering the lytic activity of aurein 1.2 that are yet to be identified.

2.2 Simulation Parameters
All simulations
were performed using the GROMACS simulation package version 3.3.3.46 The united-atom GROMOS 54a7 force field47 was used to describe aurein 1.2. Force-field
parameters for POPG and TOCL were derived from the GROMOS 54a7 force
field for lipids modified by Kukol.48−50 The simple-point-charge
(SPC) water model was used to describe the solvent water.51 Periodic boundary conditions and a minimum-image
convention were used in all three directions. All simulations were
performed at constant temperature and pressure. The temperature and
pressure were maintained using the weak-coupling method of Berendsen52 with time constants of 0.1 and 4 ps for the
temperature and pressure, respectively. The simulations of the isolated
peptides in water (system A) were performed at a constant temperature
of 310 K. The simulations of the other systems that include a lipid
bilayer were performed either at 298, 318, or 338 K as indicated in Table 1. To our knowledge,
the phase transition temperature Tm from
a gel to a liquid-crystalline phase has not been determined for a
mixed POPG/TOCL bilayer. However, experimental studies of binary mixtures
of the related cardiolipin molecule TMCL (1,1′,2,2′-tetramyristoylcardiolipin)
with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (DMPG) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (DPPG) indicated
that the lipid species mixed well, almost ideally, and that the observed
values of Tm in mixtures containing 20–30
mol % TMCL were within a temperature range defined by the Tm values of the lipid species and closer to
that of a pure DMPG or DPPG bilayer.53,54 Therefore,
given that for both POPG and TOCL, Tm <
273 K,55−59 it is reasonable to assume that a POPG/TOCL bilayer with 25 mol
% TOCL is in a fluid phase at the temperature examined. In addition,
an equimolar mixture of POPG and TOCL was shown to form a stable,
homogeneous lamellar phase.60 The temperatures
of the solute and solvent were independently coupled to the temperature
bath. A reference pressure of 1 bar was used. For the simulation of
the systems comprising a single peptide (systems A and B), a 2 fs
time step was used. In all other simulations (systems C1, C2, C3,
C4, C5, D1, D2, D3, D4, E1, and E2), a time step of 4 fs was used.
This was achieved by a combination of replacing some hydrogens by
virtual interaction sites (dummy atoms) and increasing the mass of
others.61 This removes high-frequency motions
allowing a larger time step to be used without affecting the thermodynamic
properties of the systems significantly. The lengths of all covalent
bonds within the peptide and lipid molecules were constrained using
the LINCS algorithm.62 The geometry of
the SPC water molecules was constrained using SETTLE.63 Lennard-Jones and electrostatic nonbonded interactions
were described using a twin-range method. Interactions within the
shorter range cutoff of 0.8 nm were calculated every step, whereas
interactions within the longer range cutoff of 1.4 nm were updated
every second time step together with the generation of the neighbor
list. To correct for the truncation of interactions beyond the 1.4
nm long-range cutoff, a reaction-field correction was applied using
a relative dielectric constant of 78.64

2.3 Analysis
The evolution of the secondary
structure of aurein 1.2 in the simulations was determined using the
program STRIDE.65 The helicity of aurein
1.2 was calculated as the percentage of amino acids assigned to be
in an α-helix by STRIDE with respect to the total number of
amino acids in the peptide (13). The average probability for an amino
acid to fold into an α-helix during the simulations is referred
to as the helix propensity.

The propensity of each amino acid
to interact with a lipid bilayer (contact probability), was estimated
by calculating the frequency that any atom of a given amino acid was
within 0.3 nm of any lipid atom.

The relative solvent accessible
surface area (SASA) of each residue
in aurein 1.2 was calculated using the method of Lee and Richards
with a 0.14 nm solvent probe.66,67

To evaluate the
extent to which the lipid bilayer underwent deformation
in the simulation, the ratio between the area a of
the simulation box within the plane of the bilayer (xy plane) at time t during the simulation and the
corresponding area a0 in the initial frame
of the simulation at t = 0 was calculated. For the
simulations of systems C2, C3, C4, C5, D1, D2, D3, D4, E1, and E2,
the value of a0 was taken from the initial
frame of the simulation of system C1. If a/a0 ≈ 1, then the lateral area of the bilayer
is unchanged and the surface of the bilayer stayed flat. In contrast, a/a0 < 1 indicates that either
the bilayer remained planar but the lipids were packed more densely
or the bilayer experienced bending, buckling, rippling, or infolding.

The interaction of aurein 1.2 with a lipid species was assessed
by calculating the distance r of carbon α of
Phe3 in aurein 1.2 with every lipid of a given species
(TOCL, d-POPG or l-POPG) within a radius rmax = 1.5 nm, taking periodic images into account.
The position of the lipids was taken as the position of the phosphorus
atom in d-POPG and l-POPG, and that of the phosphorus
atom in TOCL that lay closer to the Cα of Phe3. Then,
the frequency f(r) for aurein 1.2
to be at a distance r ≤ rmax from each lipid species throughout the simulation
was binned using  where n(r) is the number of occurrences in the simulation
when r was within a bin r1 < r ≤ r2.
The bin size r2 – r1 was 0.05 nm.

3 Results
3.1 Structure of Aurein 1.2 and Interaction with
a Lipid Bilayer
Circular dichroism, NMR, and infrared spectroscopy
experiments have shown that aurein 1.2 is primarily unstructured in
aqueous solution but readily folds into an amphipathic α-helix
in a solution containing d3-trifluoroethanol
(70% v/v in water) or in a membrane-mimetic
environment.3,5−8,68 To
examine the effect of the environment on its structure, aurein 1.2
was simulated in bulk water and in the presence of a TOCL/POPG model
membrane (systems A and B, respectively; Table 1). Note, in the absence of a peptide, the
TOCL/POPG lipid bilayer relaxed to a state in which the area per lipid AL calculated for each lipid species using a
grid-based approach69 was 0.85, 0.86, and
1.02 nm2 for d-POPG, l-POPG, and TOCL,
respectively. Despite the absence of experimental data on a fluid-phase
POPG/TOCL bilayer, this is consistent with AL values determined experimentally for fluid-phase TOCL and
TMCL bilayers (1.298 and 1.04 nm2)70,71 and mixtures in which TMCL was found to increase the area per lipid
of DMPC in a DMPC/TMCL bilayer. Specifically, it was estimated that AL was 0.74 nm2 in a 4:1 DMPC/TMCL
bilayer, whereas AL = 0.64 nm2 in a fluid-phase DMPC bilayer.70 Given
that AL = 0.647 nm2 for a fluid-phase
POPG bilayer,72AL is likely to be around 0.75–0.90 nm2 in
a 3:1 POPG/TOCL bilayer.

In bulk water and in the presence of
a TOCL/POPG bilayer, the peptide was initially α-helical. In
aqueous solution, aurein 1.2 transitioned between a helical and a
nonhelical structure multiple times during the 100 ns simulation.
The average helicity was 47% over the three simulations. In the presence
of a TOCL/POPG bilayer, the peptide is bound to the lipid bilayer
within the first 4 ns in all simulations and remained associated with
the membrane, thereafter. Like in the simulations in solution, the
helical content of aurein 1.2 tended to vary between 0 and 30–50%.
This is illustrated in Figure 1A which shows the time evolution of the helicity of aurein
1.2 during one of the three simulations of system B. The region of
the peptide most likely to adopt an α-helical structure was
composed of residues Phe3 to Lys8, which showed
an average helix propensity of greater than 20% (inset in Figure 1A). The average probability
of contact between each amino acid in aurein 1.2 and the lipid bilayer
over all three simulations is displayed in Figure 2A. Note, a contact between an amino acid
and the TOCL/POPG lipid bilayer was defined when any atom of this
amino acid was within 0.3 nm of any atom in a lipid molecule. From Figure 2A, it is clear that
the residues that were associated with the lipid bilayer more than
50% of the time (Gly1, Leu2, Phe3, and Phe13) are hydrophobic. This is in line with previous
experimental and coarse-grained simulation studies that identified
Phe3 and Phe13 as the key residues that anchor
aurein 1.2 within a range of lipid bilayers.13,73 A helical wheel projection of the structure of aurein 1.2 is shown
in Figure 2B. As can
be seen, Leu2, Phe3, and Phe13 lie
on the same face of aurein 1.2 when it adopts an α-helical structure
(Figure 2B). However,
despite its clear amphipathic character, in the simulations, aurein
1.2 was on average only about 50% α-helical, and a range of
alternative binding modes of aurein 1.2 on the TOCL/POPG bilayer was
also observed. Indeed, residues Ile5, Ile6,
Ile9, and Ala10 that form the central part of
the peptide and in the simulations had the highest helical propensity,
and did not interact strongly with the membrane. In fact, the contact
probability of Ile5, Ile6, and Ala10 was less than that of Lys7 and Lys8 despite
lying on the opposite side of the helical wheel projection. The relative
solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) was calculated for each amino
acid and with respect to the simulation of aurein 1.2 in solution
in system A (Figure 2C). It is interesting to note that for all residues except Phe3, there was relatively little change in the extent to which
residues were solvent-exposed whether the peptide was free in solution
or bound to the lipid bilayer. However, Phe3 was clearly
involved in interactions with lipids and showed a marked decrease
in solvent accessibility in all simulations of system B (average relative
SASA of 36%).

panel A, the inset shows the probability of each residue along the
aurein 1.2 sequence to lie in an α-helix. In panel B, the helicity

system D1. The green vertical dashed lines correspond to the times

3.2 Deformation
of a Lipid Bilayer due to Aurein
1.2 Adsorption
To examine the effect of binding of multiple
copies of aurein 1.2 on a lipid bilayer, 10 copies of aurein 1.2 were
simulated in the presence of a TOCL/POPG bilayer at 298, 318, and
338 K (systems C1, C2, and C3, respectively; Table 1). Note, all peptides were restrained to
bind to the same leaflet of the bilayer. In all cases, the peptides
were bound to the bilayer within 20 ns and remained bound throughout
the rest of the simulations. The binding of the peptide to the lipid
bilayer at 298 K was associated with an increase in the average helical
content in the peptides. This is indicated by the black line in Figure 1B, which corresponds
to the time evolution of the average helicity of aurein 1.2 in the
simulation of system C1. The red and blue lines in Figure 1B correspond to the simulations
at 318 and 338 K and show a loss of helicity with increasing temperature.
The average helicity calculated over the 10 peptides from 20 ns on
for systems C1, C2, and C3 was 27, 21, and 3%, respectively. Snapshots
of the structure of the peptide-bound TOCL/POPG bilayer at the end
of the simulations of systems C1, C2, and C3 are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen,
the binding of 10 copies of aurein 1.2 induced significant buckling
of the lipid bilayer, especially at 338 K (system C3). As an estimate
of the deviation of the bilayer surface from planarity, the change
in the lateral area of the simulation box a/a0 was calculated. Figure 4A displays the variations of a/a0 throughout the simulations of systems
C1 and C3. In both simulations, the area of the simulation box decreased
significantly. This is especially evident in the case of system C3
(a/a0 ≈ 0.85 after
80 ns). In system C1, a/a0 stabilized at about 0.93. These values are consistent with the extent
of bending and curvature observed in Figure 3. Note, a layer of water molecules was position-restrained
initially to ensure the initial bending of the peptides to the same
leaflet. The position restraints were removed after all the peptides
were bound to the leaflet, that is, within 20 ns of simulation for
all systems. It is unlikely that the deformation undergone by the
lipid bilayer was caused by these temporary position restraints as,
for example, the bilayer remained flat (a/a0 ≈ 1) in simulation C3 for the first
30 ns simulation. Simulations of systems C4 and C5 at 298 and 338
K, respectively, were performed as controls. The peptide was free
to bind to either of the two leaflets and, in this case, only negligible
curvature was observed, even at 338 K (Figure 5). In both simulations, a/a0 remained close to 1 (Figure 4A). Indeed, for system C5, a/a0 increased slightly to about
1.02–1.03 on average as a result of an expansion of the lipid
bilayer at high temperature. This clearly indicates that the distortion
of the lipid bilayer was associated with the asymmetric binding of
aurein 1.2. Despite the high degree of buckling of the bilayer in
system C3, the structural integrity of the bilayer was maintained.
The peptides neither aggregated nor penetrated into the bilayer in
any of the simulations (Figure 3). The amino acids that were in close contact with the lipids
at 298 K in the simulation of system C1 (contact probability greater
than 50% in Figure 6) were similar to those observed in the simulation of a single peptide
bound to a TOCL/POPG bilayer in system B (Figure 2A), that is, Gly1, Leu2, Phe3, Asp4, Lys7, Lys8, and Phe13. Again, the contact probability of Phe3 was noticeably higher (87%) than for the other residues for
which the contact probability was in the range of 50–64%. At
higher temperatures in the simulations of systems C2 (318 K) and C3
(338 K), the contact probability increased for all residues, possibly
because the peptides were less structured, thereby exposing all the
residues to the bilayer. Figure 7 displays histograms of the frequency f(r) for d-POPG, l-POPG, and TOCL
in the simulations of systems C1, C2, and C3 (panels A, B, and C,
respectively) to lie at a distance r ≤ 1.5
nm from a peptide taking the position of the carbon α of Phe3 in the peptide as a reference. Phe3 was chosen
as a reference because it was identified as a key membrane-anchoring
residue in all simulations. Note, f(r) was averaged over all 10 copies of aurein 1.2. As can be seen,
there were more POPG molecules than TOCL molecules in the immediate
vicinity (r ≤ 0.7 nm) of aurein 1.2 in all
simulations. This suggests that aurein 1.2 may interact preferentially
with POPG over TOCL. There was no clear distinction between the two
enantiomers of POPG.

3.3 Effect of Increasing Asymmetric
Binding of
Aurein 1.2
The effect of the binding of aurein 1.2 to a TOCL/POPG
bilayer was further investigated by gradually increasing the concentration
of aurein 1.2, starting from 10 copies of the peptide in system D1
(P/L = 1:41) to 15 in system D2
(P/L = 1:27), 30 in system D3 (P/L = 1:14), and finally 40 copies in system
D4 (P/L = 1:10) (Table 1). As noted above, the initial
binding of 10 aurein 1.2 peptides induced only limited curvature at
298 K. However, as the number of peptides bound to the bilayer was
increased (systems D2, D3, and D4), the degree of buckling of the
bilayer increased to the point that the bilayer formed hairpin-like
structures. Snapshots of the systems at the end of the simulations
are depicted in Figure 8. In all simulations, the peptides remained at the surface of the
bilayer. The increasing deformation of the TOCL/POPG bilayer is also
shown by the variation of a/a0 in Figure 4B. Each increase in the concentration of aurein 1.2 on the surface
of the bilayer led to a further reduction in the lateral area of the
bilayer. Interestingly, Figure 8 shows that aurein 1.2 was bound to the bilayer uniformly,
that is, it did not bind preferentially to regions of positive or
negative curvature but, instead, to regions where the extent of curvature
was greater. Removing the peptides (systems E1 and E2) resulted in
a commensurate reduction of the deformation of the bilayer with the
bilayer either becoming completely flat in the case of system E1 or
retaining some curvature after 40 ns in the case of system E2 (Figure 9). This is consistent
with the variations of a/a0 illustrated in Figure 4C. a/a0 converged to
close to 1 within 10 ns in the case of system E1, whereas the relaxation
of system E2 was slower with a/a0 reaching 0.9 by the end of the simulation. The change
in peptide helicity as a result of adding more copies of aurein 1.2
was also examined. The average helicity of the 10 peptides that were
included initially in system D1 was calculated during the combined
200 ns of simulation of systems D1, D2, D3, and D4 (Figure 1C). The vertical dashed lines
in Figure 1C mark the
times when more copies of aurein 1.2 were added, corresponding to
systems D2, D3, and D4. Note, the variations in helicity in the first
20 ns of the simulation of systems C1 (Figure 1B) and D1 are identical as they correspond
to the same simulation. Despite a spike following the first increase
in peptide concentration, the average helicity remained stable fluctuating
between 17 and 25%. Neither the number of peptides nor the extent
of curvature of the lipid bilayer seemed to affect the helical content
of aurein 1.2.

4 Discussion
Because of their high potency and selectivity against given cell
types, antimicrobial peptides have attracted wide interest as potential
next-generation antibiotics. However, the molecular details underlying
cell specificity and the mechanism leading to membrane disruption
have remained unclear. The interaction of aurein 1.2 with negatively
charged lipid bilayers consisting of phosphatidylglycerol only or
mixed with phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine has already
been investigated extensively.6,9−11,13−15,17,19−21,25 Therefore, this study focused
on how the presence of cardiolipin in a phosphatidylglycerol bilayer
could mitigate or suppress the membrane-disruptive activity of the
antimicrobial peptide aurein 1.2. Aurein 1.2 is a short peptide (13
amino acids). Antimicrobial peptides that are too short to span the
membrane pores have been assumed to preferentially self-assemble on
to the membrane surface and to lyse the membrane in a detergent-like
manner.74 This mechanism, referred to as
the carpet model or the detergent-like model can account for the general
features observed experimentally, but the mechanism of micellization
of membranes at the atomic level has yet to be determined. It has
been proposed that antimicrobial peptides may trigger the formation
of nonlamellar (hexagonal and cubic) lipid phases, alter lipid packing,
change the distribution of lamellar-forming and nonlamellar-forming
lipids, or simply neutralize negatively charged lipids.75 The effect of antimicrobial peptides on the
morphology of membranes has alternatively been proposed to be induced
by the strain imposed by the insertion of peptides that have a wedge-like
structure into the membrane interface, thereby perturbing the lipid
packing and order within membranes.76

In a previous simulation study, the structure of aurein 1.2 along
that of three other cationic antimicrobial peptides from Australian
tree frogs, namely, citropin 1.1, maculatin 1.1, and caerin 1.1, was
investigated in the presence of a series of membrane environments
(micelle, planar lipid bilayer, and lipid bilayer containing a pore).74 It was found that the peptides lost their α-helical
structure when bound to a planar DMPC membrane but remained helical
when bound to a region of high local positive curvature, such as a
preformed toroidal-shaped pore in a 2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer, indicating that the helicity
of the peptides depended on the matching of their intrinsic curvature
with that of the target lipid bilayer. In that case, the helicity
of aurein 1.2 was around 50%,74 in agreement
with estimates from the experiment.5,6,68 In contrast, in the simulations of systems C1 and
D1–D4, the helicity was in general below 25%. The lower helical
content suggests that the interaction between aurein 1.2 and the POPG/TOCL
bilayer used in this work may prevent aurein 1.2 from adopting a fully
α-helical structure but it is important to note that the helical
content and the lytic activity of aurein 1.2 on different model membranes
are not directly correlated.8

In
the simulations presented here, aurein 1.2 was allowed to interact
with a highly negatively charged lipid bilayer containing cardiolipin.
Given that aurein 1.2 has been shown to exhibit a greater affinity
toward anionic than zwitterionic lipid bilayers6,10,25 and the concentration in aurein 1.2 (peptide-to-lipid
ratio P/L between 1:100 and 1:10)
was within a range consistent with vesicle leakage experimentally,9,10 the POPG/TOCL mixture was expected to be sensitive to the action
of aurein 1.2. In all simulations, aurein 1.2 was bound to the lipid
bilayer, with Phe3 and Phe13 playing an important
role in anchoring the peptide to the bilayer, in line with previous
studies.13,73 Phe3 seemed to interact preferentially
with POPG than with TOCL. This is interesting as although the potential
for the binding of the peptide to induce clustering of POPG was not
examined in the present study because of statistical limitations,
the finding that Phe3 was preferentially surrounded by
POPG is consistent with results from small-angle neutron scattering
experiments that suggested that aurein 1.2 caused the redistribution
and clustering of DMPG lipids in a DMPG/DMPC lipid bilayer.20

In none of the simulations was the lipid
bilayer disrupted, even
at a high peptide-to-lipid ratio of 1:10 (system D4), a concentration
at which dye leakage from vesicles composed of an equimolar POPG/POPC
mixture has been observed experimentally.9 Instead, aurein 1.2 induced a high degree of curvature of the lipid
bilayer (see Figure 8D). Indeed micellization of the lipid bilayer may require longer
timescales. Furthermore, the size of the system and the periodic boundary
conditions may also contribute to an artificial stabilization of the
hairpin-like structures induced by aurein 1.2, preventing them from
evolving toward micelles. However, it is likely that properties intrinsic
to cardiolipin, namely, its structure and its surface charge density,
played a key role in reducing the susceptibility of the POPG/TOCL
bilayer to aurein 1.2. Cardiolipin consists of two diacylphosphatidate
moieties linked together through a glycerol headgroup. The relatively
small size of the polar headgroup compared to the volume of the quadruple-chained
hydrophobic region promotes the formation of nonlamellar lipid phases,
in particular, the inverted hexagonal phase (HII), depending
on the pH and the concentration of monovalent or polyvalent cations.77,78 Cardiolipin increases negative curvature in a lipid bilayer79 and has been shown to form microdomains in regions
of high intrinsic negative curvature in E. coli.80,81 In short, TOCL and aurein 1.2 are expected
to induce opposing effects with respect to the curvature of the lipid
bilayer. Thus, in the simulations, TOCL is predicted to work against
the membrane-disrupting action of the peptide, even at high concentrations.
The impairment of the lytic activity of the antimicrobial peptides
magainin 2, polybia-MP1, LL-37, and ΔM2 by negative curvature-inducing
lipids has also been reported.27,28,82 Specifically, phospholipid bilayers that contain HII phase-promoting
lipids such as cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine require higher peptide-to-lipid
ratios than phosphatidylglycerol for these peptides to form transmembrane
pores. Importantly, the buckling resulting from the interaction of
aurein 1.2 with the lipid bilayer was reversible. Indeed, after the
removal of the peptides, the lateral area of the simulation box relaxed
back to its value prior to the binding of the peptides and the surface
of the TOCL/POPG lipid bilayer flattened (Figures 4C and 9). This demonstrates
that the deformation of the bilayer in the simulations was caused
and maintained by the binding of peptide. Note, although the bilayer
was still visibly distorted at the end of the simulation of system
E2 (Figure 9B), the
progressive and steady increase of a/a0 simply suggests that longer timescales are required
for the system to relax fully.

Furthermore, it has been shown
experimentally that the motion and
the conformational flexibility of the glycerol headgroup in cardiolipins
are very restricted compared to other phospholipids.26,83 Interlipid interactions involving hydrogen bonding between the headgroups
are also limited in cardiolipins, potentially leaving the headgroup
more exposed to water, ions, and other solutes such as peptides.26,71,79 Aurein 1.2 that bears two positively
charged lysine residues and a net charge of +1e at
physiological pH bound strongly to the surface of a TOCL/POPG bilayer
as indicated by the high probability of contacts between the lipids
and the majority of the amino acids in the simulations (Figures 2A and 6). The propensity of aurein 1.2 to fold into an α-helix in
these simulations with cardiolipin is lower than in previous computational
and experimental work without cardiolipin.5,6,68,74 Overall, the
results of the simulations presented here are consistent with experimental
observations that aurein 1.2 is much less potent against E. coli and S. aureus model membranes,14,25 as compared to bilayers containing
phosphatidylglycerol lipids but not cardiolipin.6,9−11,15,21

5 Conclusions
In this study, the interaction
of aurein 1.2 with an anionic, cardiolipin-containing
lipid bilayer was examined using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.
Although aurein 1.2 has been shown to be potent against anionic lipid
bilayers, the effect of the presence of cardiolipin was unclear. In
general, aurein 1.2 is bound to the lipid bilayer at various peptide-to-lipid
ratios. However, in none of the simulations was aurein 1.2 able to
destabilize or disrupt the lipid bilayer, even at high peptide concentrations.
Instead, the binding of aurein 1.2 was associated with a high degree
of buckling of the lipid bilayer that was reversible in the conditions
tested. The simulations suggest that the ability of aurein 1.2 to
destabilize membranes by inducing positive curvature in them is opposed
by the intrinsic properties of cardiolipin, namely, its structural
rigidity in the interfacial region of membranes, the solvent exposure
of its charged phosphate groups, and its tendency to promote negative
membrane curvature. The presence of cardiolipin in bacterial membranes
may therefore be associated with potential resistance mechanisms against
membrane curvature-dependent antimicrobial peptides.
