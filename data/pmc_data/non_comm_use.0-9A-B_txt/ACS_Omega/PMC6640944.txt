A bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)acetone/aniline-based
benzoxazine (BHBA-a) was prepared from a bisbenzylidene-containing
bisphenol, bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)acetone (BHBA), aniline,
and paraformaldehyde through Mannich condensation in a cosolvent of
toluene/ethanol (2:1, v/v). The structure of BHBA-a was
successfully confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and 1H and 13C NMR spectra. According to the differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of BHBA, an immediate exothermic
peak after the melting peak was observed, suggesting that BHBA is thermally active. NMR data of thermally treated BHBA confirm that the immediate exothermic peak after melting of BHBA in the DSC thermogram is resulted from the curing of
a double bond. UV and 1H NMR spectra of BHBA-a show that the bisbenzylideneacetone moiety underwent dimerization
through the [2π + 2π] cycloaddition. Therefore, two procedures
were applied to cure BHBA-a. The first one was thermal
curing of the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone and oxazine moieties.
The second one was photocuring of the bisbenzylideneacetone moiety,
followed by thermal curing of the oxazine moiety. The thermal properties
of thermosets were evaluated based on these two procedures. Thermosets
of BHBA-a exhibit Tg as high
as 318 °C for curing procedure 1 and 342 °C for curing procedure
2. These values are much higher than that of a traditional bisphenol/aniline-based
benzoxazine thermoset. We conclude that the thermal curing of the
double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone and photodimerization of bisbenzylideneacetone
contributes to the good thermal properties.

1 Introduction
Polybenzoxazines
feature for special characteristics such as a
moderate-to-high thermal property,1−14 superior electrical properties,15 low
water absorption,16 and low surface energy.17 Main-chain-type polybenzoxazine precursors18,19 and multifunctional benzoxazine6,20−25 have been developed to enhance the properties of traditional bifunctional
benzoxazines. Introducing photosensitive moieties such as methacryloyl26,27 and coumarins28−30 is another strategy to enhance the properties of
benzoxazine thermosets. For example, Ishida et al. prepared methacryloyl
functional benzoxazine and studied its photopolymerization and thermally
activated polymerization.26 They found
that photopolymerization can be successfully carried out with and
without a photoinitiator, but the thermally activated polymerization
is compromised by low-temperature degradation. Kiskan and Yagci28 and Kuo et al.29,30 prepared coumarin-containing
benzoxazines and found that polybenzoxazine with highly cross-linking
networks can be obtained after photo- and thermal curing. Yagci et
al. used benzoxazine as a hydrogen donor for photoinitiated free-radical
polymerization of methyl methacrylate in the presence of 2-chlorothioxanthone
as a sensitizer to prepare benzoxazine-containing poly(methylmethacrylate).31,32 A cross-linked structure is formed, which contains small domains
of polybenzoxazine after ring-opening polymerization of benzoxazine.

Photo-cross-linkable liquid crystalline polymers with bis(benzylidene)cycloalkanone,
such as pentanone, cyclohexanone, and cycloheptanone, have been prepared
by Gangadhara and Kishore.33 They found
that the photoreactivity decreases with the increase in the ring size
of cycloalkanone. The chromophores with linear structure are likely
to favor bimolecular reactions, leading to the cross-linking of the
polymer chains. Murali and Samui have also reported bisbenzylidene
cycloalkanone as a versatile building block for polymers.34 Some of the resulting polymers have a melting
point at around 260 °C, indicating that the double bond of bisbenzylidene
cycloalkanone is thermally stable at a temperature as high as 260
°C. On the basis of bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cycloalkanone, Alagar
et al. synthesized bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cycloalkanone/aniline-based
benzoxazine (Scheme 1a).35 However, the double bond of bisbenzylidene
cycloalkanone is an exocyclic double bond, which is expected to be
less photo- and thermal reactive because of the steric hindrance.
If we replace the cycloalkanone moiety with the acetone moiety, the
steric hindrance is expected to be significantly reduced. In this
work, bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)acetone (BHBA) was prepared,
and a BHBA/aniline-based benzoxazine (BHBA-a) was prepared from BHBA, aniline, and paraformaldehyde
(Scheme 1b). The differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of BHBA (Figure 1, will be discussed
later) shows that the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone is thermally
reactive. Because the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone is thermally
reactive, two procedures were applied to cure BHBA-a.
The first one was thermal curing of the bisbenzylideneacetone and
oxazine moieties. The second one was photocuring of the bisbenzylideneacetone
moiety, followed by thermal curing of the oxazine moiety. The thermal
properties of thermosets were evaluated based on the two procedures.
Detailed synthesis and analysis were reported.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization of BHBA
BHBA was prepared from 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde
and acetone in the presence of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate,
a catalyst recommended by Narender et al. (Scheme 2). The characteristic peaks of CH=CH at 7.09 and 7.66 ppm and the signal of phenolic
OH at 10.03 ppm were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. The
characteristic peaks of CH=CH at
142 and 123 ppm and the signal of carbonyl at 188 ppm were observed
in the 13C NMR spectrum. Through the 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and 1H–13C heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) (Figures S1 and S2), the signals of aromatic hydrogens and
aromatic carbons can be correctly assigned. Figure 1a shows a DSC thermogram of BHBA. An immediate exothermic peak after the melting peak
was observed, suggesting that the double bond of BHBA is thermally active.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of BHBA and BHBA-a
2.2 Synthesis
and Characterization of Benzoxazine
(BHBA-a)
BHBA-a was prepared by
the Mannich condensation of BHBA, aniline, and formaldehyde
(Scheme 2). Reaction
in 1,4-dioxane, a common solvent for Mannich condensation, at 80 °C
for 12 h leads to low conversion and some byproducts. However, BHBA-a can be successfully prepared using toluene/ethanol
(2/1) as a solvent, a recommended medium for Mannich condensation
in our previous work.36Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR
spectra of the reaction product of the Mannich condensation in toluene/ethanol
(2:1) at 80 °C for various reaction times. A signal of triazine,
an intermediate for the Mannich condensation, was observed initially
at 4.8 ppm after 1 h, and the triazine signal gradually transforms
to benzoxazine. After 24 h, no phenolic OH and triazine signals were
observed, suggesting that the reaction was complete. After washing
the crude product by toluene, BHBA-a can be obtained
with high purity (Figure 3).

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of the reaction product of the Mannich
condensation in toluene/ethanol (2:1) at various reaction times.

Figure 3 (a) 1H NMR and (b) 13C
NMR spectra of BHBA-a in DMSO-d6.

Figure 3a shows
the 1H NMR spectrum of BHBA-a. The characteristic
peaks of oxazine at 4.71 and 5.53 ppm were observed. No signal of
phenolic OH was observed, suggesting the purity of BHBA-a. Figure 3b shows
the 13C NMR spectrum of BHBA-a. The characteristic
peaks of oxazine were also observed at 48.7 and 79.3 ppm. Through
the 1H–1H COSY (Figure S3) and 1H–13C HETCOR (Figure S4), the signals of aromatic hydrogens
and aromatic carbons were correctly assigned. A melting point at 204
°C with a delta enthalpy of 79 J/g, followed by an exothermic
peak at 235 °C with a delta enthalpy of 175 J/g, was observed
for BHBA-a in the DSC thermogram (Figure 1b). The processing window between the melting
peak and the exothermic peak temperature was 31 °C.

2.3 Thermal Properties of Thermally Cured Poly(BHBA-a)
Figure S5 shows
the 1H NMR spectra of BHBA after thermal treatment
at 240 °C for 2 h. The signals of C=C double bonds at
7.09 and 7.66 ppm disappeared, and new absorptions at 2.2 and 3.6
ppm appeared. It is known that a cyclobutane structure will be formed
in the photodimerization of bisbenzylideneacetone and the signal of
cyclobutane will be at around 4–5 ppm (4.19 and 4.58 ppm, as
shown in Figure 6).
However, there was no new absorption at around 4–5 ppm in Figure S5, suggesting that the reaction is resulted
from the thermal curing of the double bond, not from the dimerization
of bisbenzylideneacetone. The immediate exothermic peak after the
melting of BHBA also supports the thermal curing of the
double bond (Figure 1). Therefore, the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone (marked in
red in Scheme 3) and
benzoxazine (marked in blue in Scheme 3) are both thermal curable moieties in BHBA-a. Figure 4 shows the
dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) thermograms of P(BHBA-a)-X. The Tg taken from
the peak temperature of tan δ is 276 and around 318 °C
for P(BHBA-a)-220 and P(BHBA-a)-240, respectively.
The high modulus at 300 °C (higher than 1 GPa) and the small
height of tan δ intensity (less than 0.15) indicate the very
high cross-linking density of P(BHBA-a)-X. Generally, thermosets of bisphenol-based benzoxazines such as bisphenol
A/aniline-based poly(B-a) and bisphenol F/aniline-based poly(F-a)
exhibit Tg at around 150–160 °C.1,3 The very high Tg value supports the
cross-linking of the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone in BHBA-a. As listed in Table 1, the Tg values of thermosets
of bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclopentanone/p-toluidine-based
benzoxazine P(BHBP-T) and bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclohexanone/p-toluidine-based benzoxazine P(BHBH-T)35 are 202 and 189 °C, respectively. Although
the Tg values are measured by different
instruments, the Tg values of P(BHBP-T) and P(BHBH-T) are obviously lower than
that of P(BHBA-a)-X. In the introduction
part, we speculated that the exocyclic double bond of bisbenzylidene
cycloalkanone is much less thermally reactive than the double bond
of bisbenzylideneacetone because of the steric hindrance. This result
supports our speculation. According to rubber elasticity theory, the
cross-linking density of P(BHBA-a)-220 was calculated
by eq 1 suggested by
Nielsen and Landel37 1  where Ee′ is the storage modulus
in the rubbery state (dyne cm–2) and ρx is the cross-linking density (mol cm–3).

The value of ρx is
as high as
11.8 × 10–3 mol cm–3. This
value is much higher than those of other benzoxazine thermosets, demonstrating
the high cross-linking density characteristic of P(BHBA-a).20,37

Table 1 lists the
thermal stability data on P(BHBA)-X in
a nitrogen atmosphere. P(BHBA-a)-X has
the 5 wt % decomposition temperature higher than 405 °C and a
char yield at 800 °C as high as 61%. Generally, the thermoset
of bisphenol-based benzoxazines such as bisphenol F/aniline-based
and bisphenol A/aniline-based benzoxazines exhibits 5 wt % decomposition
temperature at around 300–350 °C.1,3 The
result demonstrates the high thermal stability characteristic of P(BHBA)-X. In addition, as listed in Table 1, the 5 wt % decomposition
temperatures of thermosets of bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclopentanone
and bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclohexanone-based benzoxazines35 are 259 and 247 °C, respectively, which
are much lower than that of P(BHBA-a)-X. We think the reason for better thermal stability of P(BHBA-a)-X is the same as that discussed previously for Tg values.

2.4 Thermal
Properties of UV- and Thermally Cured
Poly(BHBA-a)
Figure 5 shows the UV absorption spectra of BHBA-a in dimethylacetamide (DMAc) at a concentration of 0.8
mg/40 mL after irradiation at 365 nm for various periods of time.
An isosbestic point at 315 nm, a π–π* absorption
of the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone at 365 nm, and a δ−δ*
absorption of cyclobutane at 280 nm were observed. The intensity of
π–π* absorption decreases with the increase in
irradiation time, and the intensity of δ−δ* absorption
increases with the increase in irradiation time. After irradiation
for 30 min, an approximately 50% reduction of the π–π*
absorption was observed. This result indicates that one of the two
double bonds remains after UV irradiation, and the structure of BHBA-a dimer is proposed in Scheme 4.

Figure 5 UV absorption spectra of BHBA-a in DMAc at a concentration
of 0.8 mg/40 mL after irradiation at 365 nm for various periods of
time.

Scheme 4 Structure of BHBA-a, BHBA-a Dimer, and
P(BHBA-a)-uv-X
Figure 6 shows the 1H NMR spectra of BHBA-a after irradiation at 365 nm for various periods of
time. Two new
absorptions at 4.19 and 4.58 ppm, corresponding to the cyclobutane
structure of the BHBA-a dimer (Scheme 4), appear after irradiation for 15 min. The
appearance of the new absorption of cyclobutane is consistent with
the result of UV analysis (Figure 5). The signals for oxazine at 4.7 and 5.6 ppm are intact,
suggesting that oxazines are stable under the UV irradiation that
we have applied. The oxazines in the BHBA-a dimer can
be thermally cured, leading to P(BHBA-a)-uv-X (Scheme 4).

Figure 6 1H NMR spectra of BHBA-a after irradiation
at 365 nm for various periods of time.

Figure 7 shows
the
DMA thermograms of P(BHBA-a)-uv-X. The Tg taken from the peak temperature of tan δ
is 294, 318, and 342 °C for X as 200, 220, and
240, respectively. With the same curing temperature, the Tg value of P(BHBA-a)-uv-X is higher than that of P(BHBA-a)-X. This result indicates that the BHBA-a dimer, a tetrafunctional
benzoxazine, contributes to a higher cross-linking density.29 In addition, as shown in Figure 7, the modulus of the thermosets remains higher
than 1 GPa at 300 °C, suggesting that the thermosets exhibit
a very high cross-linking density. Furthermore, the Tg values of the thermoset of bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclopentanone
and bis(4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclohexanone-based benzoxazines,35 P(BHBP-a)-uv-200 and P(BHBH-a)-uv, are 221 and 206 °C, respectively. These values are much
lower than that of P(BHBA-a)-uv-X, confirming
our speculation that the exocyclic double bond of bisbenzylidene cyclohexanone
is much less photoreactive than the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone
because of the steric hindrance. According to rubber elasticity theory,
the cross-linking density of P(BHBA-a)-uv-220 calculated
by eq 1 is as high as
13.64 × 10–3 mol cm–3, further
demonstrating the high cross-linking density characteristic of P(BHBA-a). Table 1 lists the thermal stability data of P(BHBA-a)-uv-X. However, the thermal stability of P(BHBA-a)-uv-X is lower than that of P(BHBA-a)-X, probably because of the less thermal stability
of cyclobutane moiety or the degradation from UV irradiation.

of P(BHBA-a)-uv-X.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully prepared BHBA-a from BHBA, aniline, and paraformaldehyde
in a cosolvent of toluene/ethanol
(2:1, v/v). The DSC thermogram of BHBA shows an immediate
exothermic peak after the melting peak (Figure 1), suggesting that BHBA is thermally
active. The NMR data of thermally treated BHBA (Figure S5) confirm that the immediate exothermic
peak after melting of BHBA in the DSC thermogram is resulted
from the curing of the double bond. The UV absorption (Figure 5) and 1H NMR (Figure 6) spectra of BHBA-a show that the bisbenzylideneacetone moiety can be photocured
to afford a tetrafunctional benzoxazine, BHBA-a dimer.
Therefore, two curing procedures were applied for BHBA-a to afford thermosets. The first one was thermal curing of the bisbenzylideneacetone
and oxazine moieties, forming thermoset P(BHBA-a)-X. The second one was photocuring of the bisbenzylideneacetone
moiety, followed by thermal curing of the oxazine moiety, forming
thermoset P(BHBA-a)-uv-X. According
to the DMA thermograms (Figure 4), P(BHBA-a)-X exhibits a very
high Tg value (318 °C as X is 240). The cross-linking of the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone
might be responsible for the Tg being
much higher than that of the thermoset of general bifunctional benzoxazines.
According to the DMA thermograms (Figure 7), P(BHBA-a)-uv-X exhibits a higher Tg value (342 °C
as X is 240) than that of P(BHBA-a)-X, indicating that the BHBA-a dimer, a tetrafunctional
benzoxazine, contributes to a higher cross-linking density. In addition,
the data in Table 1 show that bisbenzylideneacetone-based polybenzoxazines exhibit much
higher thermal properties than those of bisbenzylidene cycloalkanone-based
polybenzoxazines, probably because of the less steric hindrance of
the double bond of bisbenzylideneacetone. In conclusion, we successfully
demonstrate that incorporating bisbenzylideneacetone into benzoxazine
appears to be a good strategy to afford high-performance benzoxazine
thermosets, and this work contributes the structure–property
relationship for the design of high-performance benzoxazine thermosets.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde
(from
Acros), acetone (from Acros), boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (from
Alfa), aniline (from Acros), paraformaldehyde (from PanReac), and
all solvents (high-performance liquid chromatography grade) were purchased
from various commercial sources and were used without further purification.

4.2 Characterization
DMA was performed
using a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond DMA analyzer with a sample size
of 5.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 0.2 cm. The storage modulus E′ and tan δ were determined as the sample
was subjected to the temperature scan mode at a programmed heating
rate of 5 °C/min at a frequency of 1 Hz. The test was performed
using a bending mode with an amplitude of 5 μm. UV spectra were
obtained using UV WinLab Lambda 25. Thermogravimetric analysis was
performed using a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 at a heating rate of 20 °C/min
in an atmosphere of nitrogen or air. DSC scans were obtained using
a PerkinElmer DSC 7 calorimeter in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min. NMR measurements were recorded using a Varian
Inova 600 NMR spectrometer in DMSO-d6,
and the chemical shift was calibrated by setting the chemical shift
of DMSO-d6 at 2.49 ppm. IR spectra were
obtained from at least 32 scans in the standard wavenumber range of
667–4000 cm–1 using a PerkinElmer RX1 infrared
spectrophotometer.

DSC thermogram. FT-IR (KBr): 1601 cm–1 (C=C
stretch), 1648 cm–1 (C=O stretch), 3325 cm–1 (OH stretch). UV–vis λmax(C2H5OH) = 351 nm (−C=C−).

Benzoxazine (BHBA-a)
BHBA (1.0
g) (3.76 mmol), aniline (0.7 g) (7.52 mmol), paraformaldehyde (0.451
g) (15.04 mmol), and toluene/ethanol (2:1) (30 mL) were introduced
into a 250 mL round-bottom glass flask equipped with a condenser and
a magnetic stirrer. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 24 h.
The solvent was evaporated in vacuum, and the powder was washed by
toluene and dried at 100 °C to afford a yellow powder with a
yield of 73%. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ = 4.71 (4H, H10), 5.53 (4H, H11),
6.80 (2H, H6), 6.88 (2H, H15), 7.14 (6H, H3,13), 7.24 (4H, H14), 7.53 (2H, H5),
7.58(2H, H7), 7.65 (2H, H2). 13C

(C13), 120.77 (C15), 121.761(C8),
123.61 (C3), 127.16 (C4), 127.53 (C7), 128.43 (C5), 129.12 (C14), 142.15 (C2), 147.53 (C12), 156.12 (C9), 188.01

stretch), 1232 cm–1 (Ar–O–C asymmetric
stretch), 1367 cm–1 (C–N stretch), 1601 cm–1 (C=C stretch), 1648 cm–1 (C=O stretch). A melting peak at 205 °C with an enthalpy
of 76 J/g and an exothermic peak at 235 °C with an enthalpy of
178 J/g were observed in the DSC thermogram.

4.5 Sample Preparation and Curing Procedure
4.5.1 Thermal Curing
BHBA-a (2.0 g) was melted,
stirred on a hot plate, and then cured at 180
°C (2 h), followed by 200 °C (2 h), 220 °C (2 h), and
240 °C (2 h). The thermoset is named P(BHBA-a)-X, in which X is the final curing temperature.
For example, if the curing procedure includes 180 °C (2 h), 200
°C (2 h), and 220 °C (2 h), the sample is named P(BHBA-a)-220.

4.5.2 Photocuring Followed
by Thermal Curing
BHBA-a (1.0 g) was dissolved
in DMAc (20 wt %) and
irradiated by UV light (100 W, 365 nm) for 30 min. The solution was
heated in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h to remove the solvent and
then cured at 180 °C (2 h), followed by 200 °C (2 h), 220
°C (2 h), and 240 °C (2 h). The thermoset is named P(BHBA-a)-uv-X, in which X is the final curing temperature.
