An
innovative wood flour-based adsorbent for Pb(II) removal was
synthesized via a cost-effective and environment-friendly method,
which could be high on the priority list owing to its high absorption
capacity. By increasing the specific surface and introducing functional
groups through delignification and amination, the experimental adsorption
capacity of the prepared adsorbent could reach 189.9 mg/g in 180 min
(pH = 4, T = 293 K, dosage = 1 g/L, and ion concentration
= 300 mg/L). This value is higher than most of those achieved in previous
studies on wood-based adsorbents. Pseudo-second-order and Langmuir
models were utilized to describe the adsorption kinetics and isotherms,
respectively. The effects of solution pH, adsorbent dosage, and temperature
on the adsorption efficiency were also evaluated. With a low decrease
rate of 20.2% in five cycles, the adsorbent possessed reusability.
The adsorbents exhibited high selectivity in the Pb(II), Cu(II), and
Zn(II) mixed solution, and the selectivity coefficient k of adsorbents to Pb(II) could reach approximately 2.74 in triad.
The method could prompt the development of cost-effective methods
for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater.

1 Introduction
The
removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater has been a concern
for a long time.1 With the continuous development
of electroplating, smelting, battery-making, and mining industries,
vast heavy metals, including Pb(II), Zn(II), and Cu(II), are discharged
into the water environment as wastes.2,3 These heavy
metals are toxic, nondegradable, and often deposited in organisms,4 entering animals, plants, and human bodies through
the ecological system, resulting in serious damages to the current
ecological environment and human health. Thus, there is an urgent
need to develop in order to address these serious environmental problems.5 As the United States Environmental Protection
Agency stipulates, Pb(II) could damage the nervous system in children,
affecting their intelligence, hearing, and hematopoietic ability.6 When the Pb(II) level increases, the probability
of contracting cardiovascular diseases is increased, leading to death.4 Therefore, it is desired to create new materials
and technologies for heavy-metal wastewater treatment.

Studies
have been conducted on the development of various methods,
such as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, membrane filtration,
and adsorption, to remove heavy metals from wastewater.7−11 During chemical precipitation, heavy metals could be removed by
forming insoluble precipitates. This method provides process simplicity,
good compatibility, and low cost. However, it involves disposal and
separation challenges.7 Ion exchange treatment
removes the dissolved heavy metal ions via the cation or anion exchange
between specific resins and heavy metals. The approach exhibits high
capacity, selectivity, fast kinetics, and high regeneration; however,
the technique is highly sensitive to pH and is not suitable for highly
concentrated metal solutions.8 Membrane
filtration treatments, including ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis,
and nanofiltration, could achieve high removal efficiency and involve
no phase change, but the cost is relatively high.9 Meanwhile, specific adsorbents are used to adsorb heavy
metals by physical and/or chemical interactions. Among various processes,
adsorption seems to exhibit the greatest potential because of its
good operational flexibility, high efficiency, and low cost.11

Currently, the common adsorbents prepared
from heavy metal ions
mainly include activated carbon,12 diatomaceous
earth,13 resin adsorbents,14 and so on. These adsorbents exhibit good performance, but
their preparation requires strict conditions and high energy consumption.
Recently, increasing efforts have been devoted to search for low-cost
adsorbents with high efficiency. Bioadsorbents, including tree bark,
sawdust, eggshell, lignin, cellulose, algae, and microbes, among others,
have drawn considerable attention.1,15−19 Among these bioadsorbents, wood flour (WF), which is composed of
natural polymers such as lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and other
extractives, is available in large quantities with low cost. It is
a multiscale porous material with a definite specific surface area
and abundant hydroxyl groups. In the process of cutting and pruning
trees and manufacturing of wood products, numerous WF wastes could
be produced. Burning or grinding of WF could result in environmental
pollution and waste of resources. Therefore, the reasonable utilization
of WF waste also presents a challenge.

Several studies have
explored the application of wood in wastewater
remediation.20−23 On the one hand, the adsorption properties of natural wood have
been extensively studied. Poplar wood sawdust has been utilized to
remove copper, zinc, and cadmium from electroplating wastewater.24 Maple wood sawdust has been used in Cu(II) adsorption;
at pH = 6.0, the maximum adsorption of 9.5 mg/g was obtained.22 On the other hand, wood could be modified to
expand its applications in water remediation. Meranti sawdust could
be used as adsorbents; it could adsorb Cu(II), Cr(III), Ni(II), and
Pb(II) ions from aqueous solutions with concentrations in the 1–200
mg/L range.21 Bulk beech wood after esterification
was explored for the remediation of Cu(II) from water.25 At low concentrations, the material could remove
up to 95% of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions. Moreover, iron- and zinc-doped
sawdust biochar was investigated for simultaneous removal of Cu(II)
and tetracycline from aqueous solutions via sole and binary systems,
with the help of sorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics models.26 These studies have continuously promoted the
application of wood in the wastewater treatment; however, the adsorption
capacity of these methods is relatively low, probably owing to the
existence of wood fillers with a relatively small specific surface
area and a small number of chelating groups.

To address the
aforementioned problems and optimize wood processing
residues, delignification and amination were employed to modify WF
in this study. Delignification could remove hemicellulose and lignin
to enhance the porous and loose structure of wood to enlarge its specific
surface area and increase the contact area of heavy metal ions and
absorbents. Simultaneously, the amino group could be introduced on
the wood structure surface by amination, which could be used as the
active site for chelating heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions.

The objective of this study is to synthesize a novel wood-based
adsorbent by delignification and amination and evaluate the adsorption
capacity for Pb(II) in aqueous solutions. The effects of pH, contact
time, adsorption temperature, and initial Pb(II) concentration on
the adsorption behavior of the adsorbent were also evaluated. Moreover,
the adsorption mechanism was explored by kinetics and isotherm analysis.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Chemicals
Balsa wood
flour was supplied by Zhuhai DE CHI Technology Co., Ltd. (Zhuhai,
China). All chemicals were used without further purification. Sodium
sulfite (Na2SO3, 98%), acryloyl chloride (AC)
(C3H3ClO, 98%), and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA)
(C8H23N5, TP) were purchased from
Heowns Biochemical Technologies Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Sodium
hydroxide (NaOH, 96%, AR), ethanol (CH3CH2OH,
99.7%, AR), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, AR), dichloromethane (DCM)
(CH2Cl2, 99.5%, AR), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, AR) were obtained from Beijing Chemical Works
(Beijing, China). Lead dinitrate (Pb(NO3)2,
99%, AR) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.
(Shanghai, China). Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%, AR) was provided by Xilong Chemical
Co., Ltd. (Shantou, China), and copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99%, AR) was purchased
from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China).

2.2 Preparation of Wood Flour Adsorbent
2.2.1 Delignification of Wood Flour
Balsa
wood sawdust was ground to 100 meshes to obtain WF. Delignified wood
flour (DWF) was prepared as described in the study by Hu et al.27 The WF was dispersed in a boiling solution with
2.5 M NaOH and 0.4 M Na2SO3 and reacted for
2 h under magnetic agitation. Deionized water was then used to remove
chemical residues and neutralize the solution. The upper suspension
was removed by suction filtration, and the treated WF was retained.
Subsequently, to adopt more radical measures to remove the lignin
and hemicellulose, the treated WF was dispersed in 3 M H2O2 boiling solution for 2 h and then washed to neutral
pH, filtered, and freeze-dried. The freeze-drying process could protect
the wood physical structure from full degradation and could ensure
porosity. After these delignification procedures, DWF was obtained.

2.2.2 Grafting Carbon–Carbon Double Bond
onto Delignified Wood Flour
The amount of AC used was calculated
as a 3-fold excess (mol) in glucopyranose equivalents (MW = 162 g/mol)28 under the assumption that DWF is 100% cellulose.
Theoretically, 1 mol of cellulose contains about 3 mol of hydroxyl
groups and could react with 3 mol of AC. Subsequently, 0.3 mol of
AC (27.15 g) and 0.1 of mol DWF (16.2 g) reacted in 1 mol of DCM (84.93
g) for 24 h under magnetic agitation at an ambient temperature. After
being washed with isopropyl alcohol three times, the samples were
freeze-dried to obtain DWF—C=C.

2.2.3 Amination of DWF—C=C
To modify DWF—C=C
with amino groups, 16.2 g of WF—C=C
was dispersed in 200 g of ethyl alcohol, and 0.15 mol of TEPA (28.40
g) was added dropwise. The reaction continued for 1 h under magnetic
stirring at ambient temperature. The sample was then washed with ethyl
alcohol several times and freeze-dried to obtain DWF–NH2 (Scheme 1).

2.3 Characterization
The morphological
features, element percentages, and distribution of adsorbents were
observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Hitachi
SU8010 instrument, Japan) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS; EX-350, Horiba Scientific, Japan). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area, total pore volume, and pore diameter distribution
were measured with a computer-controlled nitrogen gas adsorption analyzer
(Quantachrome AUTOSORB IQ). To achieve high test accuracy, samples
were further milled to 200-mesh particles and then analyzed with a
FTIR device (Nicolet 6700 Thermo Scientific, United States).

2.4 Adsorption Study
Stock solutions
of Pb(II) were prepared by dissolving Pb(NO3)2 in deionized water and further diluted to the concentrations required
for the experiments. The DWF–NH2 adsorbent was mixed
with a 100 mL of Pb(NO3)2 solution under constant
magnetic stirring.

The adsorption kinetics was determined at
a Pb(II) concentration of 300 mg/L and pH = 4, with a DWF–NH2 dosage of 1 g/L for 10–180 min at 293 K. The adsorption
isotherms were determined with different initial Pb(II) concentrations
(100–400 mg/L) and pH = 4, with a DWF–NH2 dosage of 1 g/L at 30 °C for 180 min. The pH effect was investigated
by varying the pH value from 2 to 5, being adjusted with 0.1 M HCl
or NaOH solutions at 293 K for 180 min, with a dosage of 1 g/L and
an ion concentration of 300 mg/L. For the adsorbent dosage study,
the adsorbent was examined at the dosages ranging from 0.05 to 0.4
g and pH = 4 at 293 K for 180 min, with an ion concentration of 300
mg/L. Meanwhile, the temperature study was determined at 293–333
K and pH = 4 for 180 min, with a dosage of 1 g/L and an ion concentration
of 300 mg/L. For competitive adsorption experiments, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were also dissolved to obtain a 300 mg/L solution.
For the regeneration study, the concentration was 200 mg/L. After
the adsorption under optimal conditions, the Pb(II) ions on the adsorbents
were desorbed by 1 M HCl for 2 h, and the adsorbents were freeze-dried,
ready for subsequent test cycles. The regeneration study was repeated
five times. After filtration, the metal ion concentration was determined
by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS6300 Shimadzu). The adsorption
capacity qe, adsorption amount qt, and the removal rate R could
be calculated using eqs 1–3. The pH values were measured using
an OHAUS ST20 pH detector.

2.5 Determination of Adsorption
Capacity and Removal
Rate
The metal ion adsorption performance of adsorbents was
determined by the adsorption capacity qe, adsorption amount qt, and removal rate R, which could be calculated using the following equations 1   2   3  where qe (mg/g) and qt (mg/g) represent
equilibrium adsorption amount and that of time t,
respectively, R (%) is the removal rate, C0 (mg/L), Ct (mg/L),
and Ce (mg/L) represent the initial, residual,
and equilibrium concentrations of the adsorbate, respectively, V (L) is the volume of adsorbate solution, and M (g) represents the dosage of the adsorbent.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Morphology and Structure
of Samples
The morphologies of the WF samples are shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1a, WF indicated that despite
several embossments,
the surface was generally smooth and close-knit. The lignin and hemicellulose
were intertwined, able to connect and fix the wood cell structure.
In Figure 1b, the DWF
surface contained numerous warped folds, indicating that the delignification
loosened the tight connections.29 In Figure 1c,d, similar loose
fibrous structures appeared, with an average fiber diameter of about
3 μm. Moreover, the morphologies of DWF–NH2 after Pb(II) adsorption under different magnifications are shown
in Figure 1e–g.
As pointed by the yellow arrows, hexagon pieces were scattered over
the surface, with a diameter of about 2.5 μm. These pieces may
be the chelate of Pb(II) with the amidogen on DWF–NH2 adsorbents.30 This finding demonstrated
that the Pb(II) ions were successfully adsorbed.

(a) WF, (b) DWF, (c) DWF—C=C,

X-ray (EDX) spectrum of DWF–NH2–Pb (the yellow
arrow points to the adsorption of a chelating agent).

As shown in Figure S1, FE-SEM observations
around the wood pits of DWF–NH2, the chelate with
a larger size was easily blocked around the pores. Due to the different
microstructures of wood powder, hydroxyl accessibility of crystalline
and amorphous regions of wood powder fibers, and the solution infiltration
process, the chelate groups would not be equally distributed. Actually,
acryloyl chloride and tetraethylenepentamine had less molecular weight,
easily penetrated into wood, and reacted with the hydroxyl of amorphous
regions.

The FE-SEM observation and the EDX spectrum of DWF–NH2–Pb are depicted. In Figure 1g, hexagonal pieces were scattered over the
wood-based adsorbent surface. The corresponding element distribution
is presented in Figure 1h. The red luminous point reflected the distribution of Pb elements,
and the intensity of hexagonal pieces pointed by yellow arrows was
relatively higher, confirming Pb(II) adsorption.

3.2 Porosity of Samples
The nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples are presented
in Figure 2. All isotherms
of the samples were similar to the Type II and III isotherms identified
in the original IUPAC classification of 1985, indicating that the
samples were nonporous or macroporous adsorbents with relatively weak
adsorbent–adsorbate and adsorbed molecules clustered around
most favorable sites. As a result of unrestricted monolayer–multilayer
adsorption up to high p/p0, a more gradual curvature indicated a significant overlap of monolayer
and multilayer adsorption.31

Figure 2 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms of (a) WF, (b)
DWF, (c) DWF—C=C, and (d) DWF–NH2.

The shapes of hysteresis loops
approximated the H3-type hysteresis
loop identified in the original IUPAC classification of 1985, stating
the existent capillary condensation, with numerous slits formed by
the accumulation of flaky particles inside.31,32 The number of micropores in the material may be lower than the minimum
value, and mainly mesopores and macropores were found in wood.33

The curves of the pore diameter distribution
obtained by the DFT
method are presented in Figure S2. The
results in Figure S2a,b indicate that the
order of pore volume from large to small was DWF > DWF—C=C
≈ DWF–NH2 > WF. This tendency was consistent
with the BET surface area data in Table 1. The pore volume of DWF was the maximum,
reaching 0.019 cm3/g, followed by 0.009, 0.008, and 0.004
cm3/g. The average pore diameters of WF, DWF, DWF—C=C,
and DWF–NH2 were 10.0, 55.5, 19.0, and 32.3 nm,
respectively. The BET surface area and porosity were reduced by grafting
modification at the late stage. Owing to the low molecular weight
and strong polarity, the ethanol solvent could cause swelling in wood
and increase its pore size.34 However,
the pore in wood remained larger than that of pure WF. Delignification
could remove fillers, such as lignin and hemicellulose, and increase
porosity, pore diameter, and specific surface area. Grafting double
bonds or amino groups could fill the pores of wood to a certain extent,
resulting in the decreased pore size and specific surface area.

3.3 Constituent Analysis of Samples
The
FTIR spectra of WF, DWF, DWF—C=C, and DWF–NH2 are presented in Figure 3. The clear transmittance peaks of the samples could
be assigned as follows: 3407 cm–1 (−OH stretching
vibration);35 2900 cm–1 (−C–H stretching vibration of the −CH3 group);36 1738 cm–1 (—C=O stretching of the acetyl group);37−39 and 1595 and 1505 cm–1 (aromatic skeletal vibration)
provided by residual lignin.40 After delignification,
the weak peaks at 1235 cm–1 disappeared, confirming
the successful removal of hemicellulose.41 The peaks of —C=O stretching of the acetyl group in
DWF—C=C and DWF–NH2 could confirm
the successful grafting of the carbon–carbon double bond onto
DWF. The absorption peaks at 1566 cm–1 (−N–H
bending vibration of amide) and 1635 cm–1 (alkene)
may overlap with the peaks of aromatic skeletal vibration from the
bit residual lignin;42 thus, the peaks
of the groups were not apparent.16 In the
spectra of DWF–NH2, the broad absorption bands at
3400 and 3200 cm–1 attributed to the −NH2 stretching vibration also overlapped with the OH stretching
vibration bands.22

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of WF, DWF,
DWF—C=C, and DWF–NH2.

To further explore the constituents, the weights
and atomic percentages
of the elements from the EDX spectra of the samples are listed in Table 2, which presents the
averages of a specific area. After the delignification and grafting
of the carbon–carbon double bond, the samples slightly changed,
but no nitrogen element could be detected. However, after the introduction
of amino, the nitrogen element could be evidently observed, confirming
that the amino was grafted with wood by adding TEPA. The percentage
of the N element that was ultimately obtained could change with the
difference in the accessibility of wood cellulose, degree of reaction,
and uniformity problem caused by penetration. Thus, 100% grafting
would be difficult to achieve.

4 Evaluation
of the Adsorption Capacity of Adsorbents
4.1 Effect
of Solution pH and Adsorbent Dosage
on Pb(II) Adsorption of DWF–NH2
Figure 4a shows the adsorption
capacity and removal rate of Pb(II) by using the DWF–NH2 adsorbent at varying pH levels. The solution pH could affect
the metal ion ionization, hydrogen ion concentration of surface functional
groups, adsorption equilibrium, and adsorption kinetics of heavy metals.
When pH was lower than 4, adsorption was repressed because the high
H+ concentration and protonated amino groups intensified
the competition and repulsion between H+ and the metal
ions for active sites on the adsorbent surface.17 At a higher pH value, the active sites passivated by H+ were released, and the adsorption was enhanced. Chelates
were more easily formed between metal ions and nitrogen atoms in DWF–NH2 because of the increased deprotonation of the amino group.
Thus, with an increase in pH, qe and R of Pb(II) adsorption increased rapidly, reaching 186.6
mg/L and 62.18%, respectively, at pH = 4. The values obtained at pH
= 4 and 5 were approximately equal. These variables were not evaluated
at pH = 6 because of the precipitation of Pb(II) ions, forming Pb(OH)2.17 Usually, wastewater containing
heavy metals is acidic.43−45 Therefore, pH = 4 could be regarded
as the optimal pH value for Pb(II) adsorption and used in all subsequent
studies.

Figure 4 (a) Effect of solution pH on Pb(II) adsorption (T = 293 K, t = 180 min, dosage = 1 g/L, ion concentration
= 300 mg/L). (b) Effect of adsorbent dosage on Pb(II) adsorption (T = 293 K, t = 180 min, ion concentration
= 300 mg/L, pH = 4).

Figure 4b
illustrates
the effect of the adsorbent dosage on Pb(II) adsorption. When the
dosage was 0.5 g/L, qe was only 87.4 mg/g.
However, with an increase in dosage, qe increased until the maximum of 193.0 mg/g was reached because of
the large number of unsaturated active sites accessible for interaction
with Pb(II).4,46 As the dose increased from 0.5
to 1 g/L, the adsorption increased by a large margin; thus, the 1
g/L dose was chosen as the optimal dose in further adsorption studies.

4.2 Kinetic Study on Metal Ion Adsorption of DWF–NH2 Adsorbents
The adsorption kinetics of metal ions
on DWF–NH2 was investigated at a constant of pH
= 4 under ambient temperature and the Pb(II) starting concentration
when the dose was 300 mg/L. In the Supporting Information, the pseudo-first-order (eq 1) and the pseudo-second-order models (eq 2) were used to fit the
experimental data.

The nonlinear and linear fitting results
of the different models are presented in Figure 5. The kinetic parameters and correlation
coefficients R2 of Pb(II) removal onto
DWF–NH2 were calculated and are listed in Table 3. As shown in Figure 5a and Table 3, adsorption quickly proceeded,
and the adsorption reached equilibrium within 180 min. The experimental qe value of DWF–NH2 was 189.9
mg/g, whereas that of DWF was only 106.7 mg/g. The R2 value for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was
0.9924, which was higher than that for the pseudo-first-order kinetic
model (0.9403). The linear fitting results were the same as those
in Figure 5b,c. These
results indicated that the adsorption was dominated by chemical adsorption
via the exchange or sharing of electrons between adsorbents and adsorbates.2,47−49

and pseudo-second-order

4.3 Adsorption Isotherms of
Metal Ion Adsorption
of DWF–NH2 Adsorbents
Adsorption isotherms
could indicate the interaction pattern between the adsorbent and adsorbate,
explaining the adsorption mechanisms. The adsorption process was fitted
using the Langmuir (eq 4), Freundlich (eq 5), and Temkin (eq 6) models in the Supporting Information, and the raw isotherms of
Pb equilibrium adsorbed amount with the equilibrium concentration
(qe vs Ce)
are presented in Figure S3.

The adsorption
isotherm fitting results are shown in Figure 6 and Table 4. By linear fitting and comparison of results, the
Langmuir model showed better adsorption of adsorbates with higher
correlation coefficient R2 (0.9864). This
result indicated that DWF–NH2 adsorbents had a homogeneous
surface with identical sorption sites.2,8 The RL values for 100, 200, 300, and 400 mg/L were
0.722, 0.565, 0.464, and 0.394, respectively, which confirmed that
the adsorption process was favorable.8,21 In addition,
the R2 value of the Temkin model was higher
than 0.95; thus, strong interactions between the adsorbed metals and
the adsorbent were observed during adsorption.8

Table 5 shows the
comparison of the maximum adsorption capacity of the resulting adsorbent
toward Pb(II) (equilibrium condition), reported previously and in
the current study. The adsorption capacity of DWF–NH2 was relatively higher. Furthermore, the simple process and mild
condition of DWF–NH2 preparation provided a better
application foreground.

4.4 Effect
of Temperature on Pb(II) Adsorption
of DWF–NH2
To explore the thermodynamic
characteristics of the DWF–NH2 adsorbents, the adsorption
isotherm experiments were conducted at different temperatures (293,
313, and 333 K) (Figure 7a). The industrial application usually requires a mild treatment
temperature; temperatures close to ambient temperature, 293, 313,
and 333 K, were selected, similar to those used in many previous studies.16,21Figure 7a presents
the change in qt as a function of time
at different temperatures. Higher temperatures could contribute to
the adsorption process. Room temperature was more feasible; thus,
room temperature (293 K) was adopted for the test.

Figure 7 (a) Effect of temperature
on adsorption capacity for Pb(II) (pH
= 4, t = 180 min, dosage = 1 g/L, and ion concentration
= 300 mg/L); (b) Pb(II) equilibrium adsorption capacity of DWF–NH2 in the adsorption–desorption experiment (adsorption
conditions: pH = 4, t = 180 min, dosage = 1 g/L,
ion concentration = 300 mg/L, and T = 293 K; desorption
conditions: HCl concentration = 1 M, t = 120 min).

4.5 Regeneration
Performance
In addition
to excellent adsorption capability, recycling stability is vital for
an adsorbent to be applicable. To evaluate the regeneration ability
of DWF–NH2, 1 M HCl was selected as the eluent for
Pb(II) desorption, and desorption continued for 120 min. Figure 7b shows the adsorption
performance of DWF–NH2 for Pb(II) adsorption during
five cycles. The qe value of DWF–NH2 for Pb(II) decreased by approximately 20.20% (from 174.8
to 139.5 mg/g) after five cycles. The decrease could be attributed
to the irreversible combination and the protonation of partial functional
groups in DWF–NH2, leading to a reduction in the
number of binding sites and weakening the electrostatic attraction
between the adsorbates and the adsorbents. In the last cycle, the
adsorption capacity was 139.5 mg/g. This result demonstrated that
DWF–NH2 has benign potential to be used as a reusable
adsorbent.1,2,14

4.6 Competitive Adsorption Experiments
Competitive adsorption
experiments were conducted by adding 0.1 mg/100
mL of DWF–NH2 into a mixed solution consisting of
Pb(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) ions under the following conditions: individual
concentration, 300 mg/L; pH 4; temperature, under 293 K; duration,
180 min. The selectivity coefficient k is calculated
according to eq 8 in the Supporting Information.
A selectivity value of >1 indicates adsorption selectivity toward
that ion.

Figure 8a shows the adsorption quantity of the adsorbents for Pb(II), Cu(II),
and Zn(II) ions at different times. Adsorption increased with time.
Compared with adsorption in a single system, although the adsorption
of Pb(II) was inhibited to a certain extent because of the competition
for active sites, the adsorption selectivity to Pb(II) of the adsorbent
still exhibited good performance with a higher selectivity coefficient k (Figure 8b). The selectivity coefficient k of the adsorbents
to Pb(II) could reach approximately 2.74 in 180 min, which was 3 times
as high as that to Zn(II) and 10 times that to Cu(II). The adsorption
capacity of the tested metal ions followed the order Pb(II) > Zn(II)
> Cu(II), demonstrating a high adsorption selectivity for Pb(II)
on
DWF–NH2. The covalent index and electronegativity
of Pb was higher than other elements, suggesting that Pb(II) exhibited
a stronger attraction than Cu(II) and Zn(II) to the lone pair of electrons
in nitrogen atoms to form complexes.55

Figure 8 Comparison
of (a) qt and (b) k of
Pb(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) ions on DWF–NH2 (pH =
4, dosage = 1 g/L, T = 293 K, and
individual ion concentration = 300 mg/L).

5 Conclusions
A novel DWF–NH2 adsorbent was synthesized by
delignification and amination of waste WF. By characterizing the morphological
characteristics and components of the samples, the successful introduction
of —C=C and −NH2 was confirmed. The
adsorption capacity of DWF–NH2 could reach 189.9
mg/g, higher than the values obtained in most existing studies. The
adsorption process of Pb(II) on DWF–NH2 was well
described by the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models, indicating
that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto DWF–NH2 was dominated
by chemical adsorption via the exchange or sharing of electrons between
the adsorbents and the adsorbates. With a slight reduction in adsorption
capacity in the regeneration study, the DWF–NH2 showed
an unlimited potential as a reusable adsorbent for practical application.
The result also revealed high selectivity to Pb(II) in the Pb(II),
Cu(II), and Zn(II) mixed solution owing to differences in the covalent
index. This study provided a practical method for preparing an economical,
efficient, environment-friendly, and reusable adsorbent based on waste
WF, for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater.
