A detailed
knowledge of the reactivity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran
(TCDF) at the molecular level is important to better understand the
transformation of dioxins analogous to TCDF in the environment. To
clarify the reactivity of the organic hydroperoxides toward TCDF,
the reaction of the TCDF with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its anion has been investigated theoretically. For the
reaction of the neutral H2O2, a molecular complex
can be formed between TCDF and H2O2 first. Then,
the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of TCDF by H2O2 occurs in the presence of the water molecules to form an
intermediate containing an O–O bond. Finally, the O–O
bond cleavages homolytically for the above intermediate. On the other
hand, as for the reaction of the anion of H2O2 (HO2–), the nucleophilic addition of
HO2– to TCDF can also occur besides the
nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction mentioned above, resulting
in the dissociation of the C–O bond of TCDF. Unlike the reaction
involving neutral H2O2, no water molecules are
required. In addition, the selected substitution effects, such as
F-, Br-, and CH3-substituents, on the reactivity of the
above reaction have also been explored. Hopefully, the present results
can enable us to gain insights into the reactivity of the organic
hydroperoxides with TCDF-like environmental pollutants.

1 Introduction
It is well known that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are
one of the most difficult-to-treat pollutants because they are resistant
to environmental degradation via biological, chemical, and photolytic
processes under natural conditions. They have potential adverse impacts
on human health and the environment because of their high toxicity.
As one of the typical POPs, polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs)
belonging to the dioxins have attracted extensive attentions. There
are many anthropogenic and natural sources to produce PCDFs in the
presence of the chlorine source. To this day, more and more studies
have been performed to understand the formation1−8 and degradation9−20 of PCDFs. Moreover, many methods have been developed for the thermal
and chemical decomposition of PCDFs. However, only the active hydroxyl,
NO3, and H radicals can react with PCDFs due to their unique
structures. Therefore, seeking novel species to react with PCDFs is
important for the transformation of PCDFs.

Recently, it has
been reported that the organic hydroperoxides
(e.g., H2O2) can readily react with the chlorinated
benzoquinones (e.g., tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone and
2,5-dichlorobenzoquinone), where OH, organic alkoxyl radicals, and
other highly reactive free radicals have been produced experimentally.21−24 Moreover, these produced radicals can lead to the DNA oxidation,
which can be used to account for the potential carcinogenicity of
the halogenated aromatic compounds.25 In
addition, it was also found that water molecules are necessary for
the production of free radicals.26,27

From
the structural viewpoint, PCDFs have similar geometrical features
as those of the chlorinated benzoquinones. For instance, all of them
have planar ring structures and C–Cl bonds. Meanwhile, they
are also good electron acceptors because they have positive electron
affinities.28−31 In this case, it is expected that PCDFs and chlorinated benzoquinones
may have some similarities in reactivity.

Inspired by the reactivity
of organic hydroperoxides with chlorinated
benzoquinones,21−27 we wonder if the organic hydroperoxides can also react with the
PCDFs so as to transform the PCDFs. If possible, what are the detailed
reaction mechanisms? Clearly, the answers of the above questions can
give us a full understanding of the reactivity of organic hydroperoxides
as well as the transformation of PCDFs environmental pollutants. Unfortunately,
no relevant studies have been reported so far to the best of our knowledge.
Probably, the high toxicity of the PCDFs limits the performance of
the relevant experiments.

Therefore, taking 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran
(TCDF) as a model
compound of PCDFs, its reactions with H2O2 and
its anion have been explored using the density functional theory (DFT).
The detailed reaction mechanisms have been discussed for the whole
reaction as well as the substitution effects of F-, Br-, and CH3-groups on the reactivity of the title reaction. Expectedly,
the present findings not only can further enrich the understanding
of the potential reactivity of organic hydroperoxides but can also
provide useful clues to the performance of the related experimental
studies on the transformation of the PCDFs environmental pollutants.

2 Results and Discussion
As displayed in Scheme 1, the reaction mechanisms of
the title reaction have been
proposed. Similar to the reaction between tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone and H2O2,26,27 the whole reaction is initiated by the formation of a molecular
complex (MC). Then, the nucleophilic attack of H2O2 to TCDF takes place to form an intermediate (IM) containing
an O–O bond. Finally, the O–O bond homolytically decomposes,
leading to the production of radicals. The above reaction mechanisms
were testified as follows.

Scheme 1 Proposed Reaction Mechanism between TCDF
and HO2–
2.1 Reaction of TCDF with the Neutral H2O2
First of all, the direct reaction between
TCDF and H2O2 has been investigated. In view
of the C2v symmetry of
TCDF and the possible orientations of the H atom in H2O2, four nucleophilic attack modes of H2O2 to TCDF, i.e., modes a, b, c, and d, have been considered. As shown
in Figure 1, the corresponding
transition states TSn (n = a–d)
for each mode have been located.

Figure 1 Optimized transition states for the direct
nucleophilic attack
of H2O2 on TCDF. The selected distances are
given in angstrom, which is true for the following figures.

As presented in Table 1, the calculated energy barriers
for the four nucleophilic
attack modes are 51.06, 51.28, 53.82, and 52.08 kcal/mol, respectively.
Obviously, such high-energy barriers suggest that it is very difficult
for the title reaction to take place under normal conditions. Can
solvent effects promote the nucleophilic attack processes? To answer
this question, the solvent effects in aqueous solution have been considered
by employing the solvent model density (SMD) model. As a result, as
presented in Table 1, the energy barriers of the four reaction processes have been changed
ranging from −2.71 to 0.24 kcal/mol upon going from the gas
phase to solution, suggesting slight solvent effects on the reaction
involving the neutral H2O2. Therefore, the nucleophilic
attack processes are still difficult to proceed even in the solution.

level of theory. ΔE1 and ΔE2 refer to the results in the gas phase and
in aqueous solution calculated with the SMD solvation model, respectively.

Moreover, given the fact that
the above nucleophilic attack process
involves the proton transfer (PT) process from H2O2 to the dissociated chlorine atom of TCDF and water molecule
is a good catalyst in assisting the PT, the reaction between TCDF
and H2O2 has been explored with the help of
the different numbers of water molecules ranging from 1 to 3 based
on the attack mode b. For simplicity, the symbols MC(nw), IM(nw), and TS(nw) have been
used to denote the located MCs, intermediates, and transition states,
where nw stands for the number of the water molecules introduced.
Here, four reaction pathways have been named as A, B, C, and D in
terms of the numbers of the introduced water molecules in the reaction,
corresponding to the presence of 0, 1, 2, and 3 water molecules, respectively.

2.1.1 Formation of the MCs
First, the
MCs formed during the reaction have been investigated based on the
intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations of the located transition
states TS1(nw)n=0–3 in the nucleophilic attack processes. As shown in Figure 2, different MCs MC(nw)n=0–3 have been obtained.
In view of the high toxicity of TCDF and the instability of MCs, it
is necessary to characterize them theoretically. Therefore, the atoms-in-molecule
(AIM) analyses of these MCs have been performed. Correspondingly,
the molecular graphs and the topological analyses of these MCs have
been given in Figure S1 and Table S1 of
the Supporting Information (SI), respectively.

Figure 2 Optimized molecular complexes
(MCs), intermediates (IMs), and transition
states (TSs) for the available reaction pathways.

As displayed in Figure 2, TCDF, H2O2, and H2O interact
with each other via the intermolecular H-bonds in the MCs. As shown
in Figure S1 of the SI, this point can
be further verified by the location of the corresponding bond critical
points (BCPs). As for the introduced H2O molecules, they
interact with both the TCDF and H2O2 via intermolecular
H-bonds. As presented in Table S1 of the
SI, the positive ∇2ρbcp and Hbcp at the BCPs suggest that most of the intermolecular
H-bonds are governed by the electrostatic interactions, which can
be also reflected from the large H-bonding distances. For the selected
H-bonds formed between H2O2 and H2O in MC(2w) and MC(3w), they should possess the partial covalent
properties as can be seen from the positive ∇2ρbcp and negative Hbcp at the BCPs.

As displayed in Figure 3 and Table 2, the formed MC(0w) has been stabilized by 1.75 kcal/mol relative
to TCDF and H2O2. Moreover, the stabilization
energy increases upon increasing the number of water molecules. For
instance, MC(1w), MC(2w), and MC(3w) have been stabilized by 7.64,
17.14, and 24.81 kcal/mol, respectively. At the same time, the negative
enthalpy changes suggest that the formation of the MCs is an exothermic
process. Especially, the released reaction heat increases upon increasing
the numbers of water molecules, which is crucial for the subsequent
reaction steps probably.

reactants and
products, respectively.

2.1.2 Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Process
As displayed
in Figure 2, all of
the transition states TS1(nw)n=0–3 in the nucleophilic attack process
have been located, where all of them have been verified by the IRC
calculations. As displayed in Figure 4, the microscopic details during the nucleophilic attack
process can be observed. For instance, for the process without involving
water molecules, one of the O atoms (O22) of H2O2 directly attacks the C atom (C11) of TCDF. Meanwhile, the H atom
(H23) of H2O2 and the Cl atom (Cl19) of TCDF
begin to dissociate simultaneously. As a result, the intermediate
IM(0w) can be obtained accompanied by the dissociation of the H23
and Cl19 atoms. Note that the O22–H23 bond of H2O2 begins to increase significantly until the O22 atom
approaches the C11 atom of TCDF within a certain distance, reflecting
the asynchrony of the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction.
As for the process involving one water molecule, as displayed in Figure 4, the introduced
H2O molecule accepts the proton of H2O2 and gives its own proton to the chlorine atom of TCDF simultaneously,
reflecting the catalytic role of H2O in the PT. Moreover,
no zwitterionic species have been observed during the PT process.
Therefore, the above PT processes should proceed in one step. Similarly,
the same phenomena have also been observed in the PT processes assisted
with 2 and 3 water molecules.

Figure 4 Variations in the selected bond lengths along
with the IRC of the
transition states TS1(0w) (left) and TS1(1w) (right).

To further clarify the catalytic role of water
molecules, the selected
distances associated with the nucleophilic attack processes have been
analyzed. As shown in Figure 2, it was found that the distances between the dissociated
chlorine atom and its adjacent C atom (RC···Cl) in the TSs decreased upon introducing the water molecules. Moreover,
the RC···Cl decreases upon
increasing the number of water molecules. For instance, the RC···Cl is 2.293, 2.201, 2.158,
and 2.135 Å in the transition states TS1(nw)
involving 0, 1, 2, and 3 water molecules, respectively. However, the
opposite is true for the distance between the attacking O atom of
H2O2 and the attacked C atom of TCDF. In other
words, H2O2 and TCDF have no obvious geometrical
deformation upon introducing the water molecules relative to the direct
reaction, implying the decrease in the energy barriers in the presence
of water molecules.

Expectedly, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, the original energy barrier has been reduced
significantly
with the help of explicit water molecules. For instance, the energy
barrier is decreased by 30.43 to 20.85 kcal/mol with the help of three
water molecules, suggesting the positive catalytic role of water molecules.
Therefore, it is feasible for the nucleophilic aromatic substitution
process to take place with the assistance of H2O molecule.

2.1.3 Cleavage of the O–O Bond
Subsequently,
the intermediates IM(nw)n=0–3 containing the O–O bond can be
produced after the nucleophilic aromatic substitution process. As
displayed in Figure 2, more intermolecular H-bonds can be observed in intermediates IM(nw)n=0–3, which can be
verified by the presence of the BCPs, as shown in Figure S1 of the SI. Moreover, as presented in Table S1 of the SI, these intermolecular H-bonds
can be divided into two groups in terms of the AIM results. Namely,
for the intermolecular H-bonds involving the original TCDF fragment,
they should be governed by the electrostatic interactions, as can
be seen from the positive ∇2ρbcp and Hbcp at the BCPs of H-bonds. On
the other hand, the rest H-bonds formed between the other fragments
should possess partially covalent characters as can be seen from the
positive ∇2ρbcp and negative Hbcp results at the BCPs, as well as their short
H-bonding distances ranging from 1.552 to 1.795 Å.

To explore
the strength of the O–O bonds, the vertical and adiabatic bond
dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of the O–O bonds in IM(nw)n=0–3 have been calculated
as well as that of H2O2. As presented in Table 3, the O–O bond
of H2O2 is significantly weakened upon the formation
of the IM(nw)n=0–3. For instance, the corresponding vertical BDE of H2O2 (48.62 kcal/mol) has been decreased by about 27.53 to 21.09
kcal/mol in IM(0w). Meanwhile, the significant decreases in the adiabatic
BDE have also been observed if the structural relaxation effects are
considered. Therefore, from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, it is
easy to cleavage for these O–O bonds in IM(nw)n=0–3.

bond in H2O2 and the Intermediatesa

a All of the units
are in kcal/mol.
The data in parentheses refer to adiabatic BDEs.

Moreover, as displayed in Figure 2, the corresponding
TSs involved in the cleavage of
the O–O bond have been located. As displayed in Figure 3 and Table 2, the energy barrier is 5.42 kcal/mol for
the cleavage of the IM(0w). Moreover, the energy barriers are 7.66,
21.90, and 28.31 kcal/mol with the help of 1, 2, and 3 water molecules,
respectively. Here, note that these TSs are lower in energy by 1.04,
4.91, 2.42, and 2.73 kcal/mol than the free reactants, respectively.
Therefore, the intermediates IM(nw)n=0–3 can produce two radicals via the homolysis of the
O–O bond.

Compared with the nucleophilic attack processes,
the energy barrier
for the cleavage of the O–O bond is relatively small. Therefore,
the nucleophilic attack process should be the rate-determining step
in the whole reaction. At the same time, as shown in Table 2, the negative enthalpy changes
suggest that the whole reactions are exothermic processes.

2.2 Reaction of TCDF with HO2– Anion
Moreover, given the fact that the anion of H2O2 (HO2–) exists due
to the dissociation equilibrium of H2O2, and
that the HO2– anion is a better nucleophile
relative to the neutral H2O2, so the direct
reaction between TCDF and HO2– has also
been investigated.

As shown in Figure 5, four different modes of nucleophilic attack,
i.e., modes a′, b′, c′, and d′, have been
considered based on the structural symmetry of TCDF. Similar to the
reaction of TCDF with the neutral H2O2, the
MCs and TSs for the four modes have also been located. Subsequently,
nucleophilic attack by HO2– on TCDF takes
place, resulting in the formation of the intermediates containing
an O–O bond. As expected, the subsequent process should proceed
to produce radicals through the cleavage of the O–O bond homolytically.
Unlike the reaction of the neutral H2O2 mentioned
above, no explicit water molecules are needed here. Moreover, it was
found that the formed four MCs have been stabilized by about 24.34,
22.90, 31.35, and 30.87 kcal/mol relative to the separated reactants,
respectively. Similarly, the corresponding TSs are also lower in energy
by about 16.69, 15.84, 15.55, and 15.01 kcal/mol relative to the initial
reactants. So, the calculated energy barriers for the nucleophilic
attack of TCDF by HO2– are 7.65, 7.06,
15.81, and 15.87 kcal/mol relative to the MCs, respectively. In aqueous
solution, the energy barriers are 17.71, 17.29, 21.55, and 21.67 kcal/mol
relative to the separated reactants, respectively. Compared with the
results in the gas phase, the important solvent effects should be
highlighted for the anionic system. Overall, the calculated energy
barrier for the reaction of HO2– with
TCDF is smaller than that of the reaction of the neutral H2O2, exhibiting the dependence of the title reaction on
the pH value of the solution.

Figure 5 Optimized MCs and TSs in the nucleophilic aromatic
substitution
reaction of TCDF with HO2–.

In addition, as shown in Figure 6, another reaction mode has also been observed,
i.e.,
the HO2– can attack the C* atom directly
attached to the O atom of TCDF. In detail, first, a MC′ can
be formed following by the nucleophilic addition of HO2– to the C* atom via TS1′ to form IM′,
where the energy barrier is only 1.08 in the gas phase relative to
the corresponding MC, respectively. Then, the C*–O bond in
the intermediate IM′ can be dissociated via the transition
sate TS2′. Here, the corresponding energy barrier of 1.71 (4.17)
kcal/mol in the gas phase (aqueous solution) suggests that the dissociation
of the C*–O bond is easy to occur, where the energy barrier
of the dissociation of the O–O bond of IM′ is 13.13
kcal/mol. Moreover, the energy barrier of 26.76 kcal/mol is required
to overcome the dissociation of the O–O bond after the dissociation
of the C*–O bond. Therefore, it is easy to dissociate the C–O
bond of TCDF in the presence of HO2–.

2.3 Substitution Effects
To further investigate
the reactivity of the organic hydroperoxides with TCDF and its derivatives,
the reactions between H2O2 and the F- and Br-substituted
TCDFs have been investigated, as well as the reaction between the
TCDF and the CH3-substituted H2O2. Here, only the rate-determining step, i.e., the nucleophilic attack
process involving three water molecules, has been considered. As shown
in Figure 7, the located
TSs are similar to the above TS1(3w). For the reactions of F- and
Br-substituted TCDF with H2O2, the calculated
energy barriers of 19.03 and 18.98 kcal/mol are lower by 1.82 and
1.87 kcal/mol than those of the results before substitution. As for
the reaction of the CH3-substituted H2O2 with TCDF, the energy barrier of 21.76 kcal/mol is higher
than that of the result before substitution by 0.91 kcal/mol. Thus,
it is feasible for the reaction to take place between the neutral
organic hydroperoxides and the TCDF and its derivatives.

Figure 7 Calculated
TSs in the nucleophilic attack of TCDF and its derivatives
by hydroperoxides (top) and their anions (middle and bottom), where
F-, Br-, and CH3-substitutions are shown from left to right,
respectively.

Moreover, the reactions
involving the anions of the organic hydroperoxides
have also been investigated. Taking the model a′ for example,
the corresponding TSs have been given in Figure 7. For the reactions of HO2– with F- and Br-substituted TCDF, the energy barriers
are 3.04 and 8.66 kcal/mol relative to the MCs, which are lower and
higher by 4.61 and 1.01 kcal/mol than those of the reactions before
substitution, respectively. Similarly, as for the reaction of the
CH3-substituted HO2– with
TCDF, the energy barrier of 3.83 kcal/mol is lower than the reaction
before substitution by about 3.82 kcal/mol.

As for the nucleophilic
addition reaction of HO2–, as displayed
in Figure 7, the energy
barriers associated with the
C–O bond dissociation are 1.43, 1.85, and 4.68 kcal/mol for
the F-, Br-, and CH3-substituted cases, respectively. On
the basis of the above results, one can say that the anions of the
organic hydroperoxides are easier to react with the TCDF and its derivatives
than those of the neutral hydroperoxides.

In summary, the organic
hydroperoxides (especially their anions)
can react with TCDF and its derivatives. Taking the reactions of ROO– (R = H or alkyl groups) with TCDF as an example, their
reaction mechanisms can be outlined as follows. As shown in Figure 8, on the one hand,
nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction occurs between TCDF and
ROO– to form an intermediate containing an O–O
bond. Then, the O–O bond of the intermediate cleavages homolytically,
leading to the production of the different radicals depending on the
selected substituents in the ROO–. On the other
hand, nucleophilic addition reaction can also easily occur between
TCDF and ROO–, resulting in the dissociation of
the C–O bond of TCDF. Certainly, more complicated experiments
are highly desirable to further verify the present findings.

groups).

3 Conclusions
In this study, the reaction mechanisms of the neutral and anionic
H2O2 with TCDF and its derivatives have been
explored using the DFT. The principal conclusions are summarized below.(1) It is difficult
for the reaction to
take place between TCDF and neutral H2O2 for
the direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution process. However, the
explicit water molecules can efficiently promote the proceeding of
the reaction via the decrease in the energy barrier. On the contrary,
the bulk solvent effects have slight influences on the reaction.

(2) The reaction of TCDF and
its derivatives
with HO2– can occur easily and does not
require the assistance of water molecules. On the one hand, nucleophilic
aromatic substitution reaction can occur between TCDF and ROO–, leading to the production of the different radicals
depending on the selected substituents in the ROO–. On the other hand, nucleophilic addition reaction can also easily
occur between TCDF and ROO–, leading to the dissociation
of the C–O bond of TCDF. Overall, it is much easier for the
anions of the organic hydroperoxides to react with the TCDF than those
of the neutral cases, suggesting the high dependence of the reactivity
of the title reaction on the pH value of the media.

(3) In view of the fact that the formed
extremely reactive radicals (e.g., hydroxyl and alkyl radicals) may
cause potential damage to organisms, so the title reaction can partially
account for the toxicity mechanism of TCDF-like environmental pollutants.
Certainly, the related experiments are highly desirable to further
confirm the present findings.



4 Computational Details
Geometry optimizations for all of
the species in this study have
been performed within the framework of the DFT theory using the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
level of theory, where the accuracy and reliability of the DFT have
been confirmed by many systems.32−45 Then, vibrational frequency analysis has been carried out for the
optimized geometries to confirm the stability of the located stationary
points. Moreover, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)46,47 calculations were also carried out to ensure that the calculated
transition states connected the reactant and product properly. In
addition, all of the Cartesian coordinates of the studied species
have been given in the SI for reference.

For comparison, the selected calculations have also been performed
at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. As presented in Table 1, both the B3LYP and
M06-2X methods can give consistent results with each other for the
calculated energy barriers in the nucleophilic attack process. Given
the compromise between the accuracy and computational cost for the
present systems, the results using the B3LYP method have been mainly
discussed throughout.

To explore the implicit solvent effects
on the reactivity of the
reaction, the SMD solvation model48 was
used. To clarify the catalytic role of water molecules in assisting
the PT process, different numbers of water molecules ranging from
1 to 3 have been introduced.

To confirm the formation and the
nature of the intermolecular H-bonds,
atoms-in-molecules (AIM) analyses have been performed. According to
the AIM theory,49 the interatomic interactions
were indicated by the location of a bond critical point (BCP) and
the interaction strengths can be evaluated from the electron density
(ρbcp) at the BCP. Similarly, ring structures were
characterized by their corresponding ring critical point. What is
more, the topological parameters at the BCP, e.g., the Laplacian of
ρbcp (∇2ρbcp)
and the energy density (Hbcp), can be
used to characterize the nature of the H-bonding interaction. In detail,
∇2ρbcp < 0 suggests the existence
of a covalent bond and ∇2ρbcp >
0 and Hbcp > 0 suggest the presence
of
a noncovalent bond, such as H-bonds and van der Waals interactions.
In addition, when ∇2ρbcp > 0
and Hbcp < 0, the interactions should
have partial
covalent properties.50−52

To evaluate the O–O bond strength in
the formed intermediate,
the adiabatic bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of the O–O
bonds have been calculated as the enthalpy difference between the
dissociated fragments and the intermediate. As for the vertical BDE,
it is calculated as the total energy difference before and after the
dissociation without considering the structural relaxation.

All of the DFT calculations were done employing Gaussian 09 software
package.53
