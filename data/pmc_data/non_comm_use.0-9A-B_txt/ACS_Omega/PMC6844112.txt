Chalcocite-dominant
secondary copper ore with a high pyrite content
had a rapidly increased iron concentration in the middle and later
periods of bioleaching, which increased the difficulty of separating
copper and iron ions in the leaching solution. In the two aspects
of microbial community succession and energy band theory, the selective
dissolution mechanism of chalcocite in this type of copper ore was
analyzed and illustrated using experiments and first-principles calculations.
The results showed that controlling the solution potential at a lower
level was beneficial to the selective leaching of chalcocite, while
bacteria promoted the leaching of pyrite and chalcocite simultaneously
by oxidizing Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the solution. Below
700 mV of solution potential, the bacterial community, mainly consisting
of Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus, had a stronger promotion on the selective dissolution of chalcocite.
The solution energy level of bioleaching was higher than ideal pyrite
but lower than ideal chalcocite, which resulted in the accumulation
of electrons on the surface of pyrite and the formation of holes at
the top of the chalcocite valence band. When bacteria assisted the
oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and caused the raise
of the solution potential, the difference between the solution energy
level and the top of the pyrite valence band would be smaller than
the width of the pyrite energy gap. Below 700 mV, the assistance of Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus on
the oxidation of Fe2+ was weak. Chalcocite would be selectively
dissolved by oxygen and a small amount of Fe3+ in the solution.
Because of the existence of Fe, Cu, and S vacancies in real minerals,
the atomic activity in the Cu–S bond and the Fe–S bond
enhanced, and the reaction difficulty between chalcocite, pyrite,
and electron acceptors in the solution reduced. The solution potential
should be controlled at 600 mV or less to ensure the selective dissolution
of chalcocite.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Chalcocite (Cu2S) is a kind of secondary mineral formed
by oxidation, reduction, dissemination, and migration of primary sulfides
such as chalcopyrite. As an important raw material for copper extraction,
chalcocite has the highest copper content in copper sulfide minerals.
Bioleaching of chalcocite has the advantages of economy and environmental
protection. Its principle is to complete the oxidation of Fe2+ and S2– by bacteria and directly or indirectly
promote the dissolution of copper sulfide minerals.1 With the gradual depletion of chalcopyrite-dominant copper
ores, more and more chalcocite-dominant copper ores with a high pyrite
content are treated. However, in the middle and later periods of bioleaching
of copper ores, iron ions in the leaching solution tend to accumulate
rapidly.2 This problem increases the difficulty
of separating copper and iron ions from the leaching solution and
makes the influence of wastewater on the environment deeper. Therefore,
it is necessary to selectively dissolve chalcocite from the secondary
sulfide copper ores with a high pyrite content in bioleaching.

In chalcocite-dominant copper ores, Fe mainly exists as pyrite
(FeS2). In bioleaching, S2– on the surface
of pyrite participates in the single electron transfer reaction, and
is oxidized to Sn2–,
S0, and SO42– in turn by bacteria.3 Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ by bacteria and entered the solution to promote the dissolution
of chalcocite.4 Chalcocite is transformed
into covellite by multistep oxidation. Under the action of Fe3+ and dissolved oxygen, covellite is further decomposed into
Cu2+ and S0.5 Obviously,
Fe2+ ions produced by pyrite dissolution are closely related
to the dissolution of chalcocite, and are also the main source of
Fe2+ ions required by bacteria.

Previous studies
have shown that dissolved oxygen and Fe3+ are the two main
oxidants for pyrite dissolution. With the low pH
value, the oxidation rate of pyrite is positively correlated with
the concentration of Fe3+.6,7 Because the
change of the concentration ratio between Fe3+ and Fe2+ determined the oxidation reduction potential (ORP), the
dissolution rate of pyrite is closely related to the solution potential.
Electron transfer of the oxidant from the mineral surface to the solution
is a limited step in pyrite dissolution. Therefore, the oxidation
of pyrite is controlled by the chemical reaction.8 When the solution potential is greater than 546 mV in bioleaching,
the bonds on the surface of pyrite break and the ore begin to dissolve.9 When the solution potential is greater than 600
mV, the oxidation rate of pyrite accelerated significantly,10 and bacteria can increase the oxidation rate
of Fe2+ by more than 106 times.11 Therefore, it can be considered that controlling bacterial
activity and delaying the oxidation of Fe2+ are the two
essential methods to control pyrite dissolution. Previous studies
have shown that the bioleaching of chalcocite is controlled by the
diffusion of Fe3+ ions and chemical reactions. When the
concentration of Fe3+ in the solution is lower than 0.058
mol/L, the leaching process is mainly controlled by the mass transfer
of Fe3+ ions. When the concentration of Fe3+ ions is higher than 0.058 mol/L, the leaching process is mainly
controlled by the surface charge transfer of minerals.12 Compared with pyrite, the leaching of chalcocite
is less affected by bacteria. With the increase of the Cu2+ concentration in the solution, the number of bacteria on the surface
of chalcocite decrease, and Cu+ are mainly oxidized by
Fe3+ in the solution.13,14 At present,
the dissolution behavior of pyrite in bioleaching has been studied
extensively. However, more theoretical analyses about the dissolution
characteristics of mixed minerals containing pyrite and chalcocite
are needed.

The surface reaction of a metal sulfide semiconductor
in an electrolyte
solution is the critical factor affecting its dissolution mechanism.
The difference between the ORP of the solution and the Fermi level
of the solid determines the reaction mechanism. The semiconductor
band model can describe the reaction process of the sulfide ore surface
in the solution clearly. Holmes and Crundwell have explained the dissolution
mechanism of pyrite in acidic solution by energy band diagram.7 The diagram shows the energy levels of solid
and liquid at the pyrite–solution interface. At the dissolution
equilibrium, the Fermi levels of solids and liquids are equal. The
study on the mixed bioleaching system of sphalerite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite
shows that bacteria enhance copper leaching mainly by enhancing the
ability of oxygen to obtain electrons.15 Obviously, the model of the energy band can also be used to explain
the dissolution mechanism of chalcocite in the presence of pyrite
in bioleaching.

Using the first-principles method of density
functional theory
(DFT), we can accurately obtain the crystal parameters and properties
of various minerals. This provides great convenience for the theoretical
analysis of the energy band in the dissolution of sulfide ores. However,
there are few DFT studies and band analyses in bioleaching of chalcocite,
which have significant research value. Based on the analysis of previous
works, we speculate that the dissolution of chalcocite in real minerals
is easier on the conditions of higher solution potential and the ferrous
oxidation rate. In this paper, pure minerals of chalcocite and pyrite
were separated from secondary copper sulfide samples. By analyzing
the change of the solution potential and the bacterial community structure,
the difference of dissolution of two minerals in bioleaching was studied.
Subsequently, the crystal models of chalcocite and pyrite were constructed,
and the energy band distributions of the two minerals in real conditions
were investigated. Our objectives are to determine the dominant group
in the selective leaching and the leaching effect of chalcocite with
the change of the solution potential and the bacterial community structure.
Furthermore, the role of pyrite in selective bioleaching of real minerals
should also be determined to explain the mechanism of selective dissolution
of chalcocite in bioleaching.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Bacteria on the Leaching Process
of Pure Minerals
The chemical composition analysis results
of the secondary copper sulfide sample are shown in Table 1. It shows that the sample contained
0.28% of Cu, 3.03% of Fe, and 3.51% of S, respectively. The sample
consists of quartz, muscovite, pyrite, chalcocite, and a small amount
of covellite, as described in the previous work.35 It can be inferred that copper mainly exists in the form
of chalcocite and covellite, and iron mainly exists in the form of
pyrite.

Table 1 Chemical Composition Analysis of Sample
element	Cu	S	Fe2O3	As	SiO2	Al2O3	CaO	K2O	Na2O	MgO	
content (wt %)	0.28	3.51	3.03	0.02	78.77	14.17	0.07	1.48	0.06	0.05	
Table 2 shows the
chemical composition analysis results of two pure minerals separated
and enriched from the raw ore. It shows that the purity of the two
pure mineral samples is greater than 92%. The content of Fe in chalcocite
and Cu in pyrite is less than 3%, which means that the influence of
the two elements on the dissolution of respective main minerals can
be neglected.

Table 2 Chemical Composition Analysis of Pure
Minerals (wt %)
mineral	Cu	Fe	S	SiO2	purity	
chalcocite	68.42	2.53	23.98	0.11	92.40	
chalcocite (theoretical)	80.00	 	20.00	 	100.00	
pyrite	0.19	44.19	47.94	1.39	92.13	
pyrite (theoretical)	 	46.67	53.33	 	100.00	
The leaching experiments of pure minerals were carried
out in conical
flasks. The effect of the inoculation ratio on the leaching efficiency
of metal ions from two pure minerals was investigated. The results
are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Effect of various inoculation ratios (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) on leaching
efficiency of pure minerals at 30 °C.

As shown in Figure 1, the leaching effects of metal ions from chalcocite and pyrite by
bacteria are obviously different. Between 0 and 120 h, the leaching
efficiency of Cu increases slowly. When the leaching time exceeded
120 h, the leaching efficiency increases significantly. For pyrite,
the increase of leaching efficiency of Fe is the highest from 75 to
220 h. After 220 h, the leaching efficiency of Fe barely changes.
At the same leaching moment, the leaching efficiency of Cu is always
higher than pyrite. It can be seen that the change of the inoculation
ratio has little effect on the leaching efficiency of metal ions from
two pure minerals. The results show that the leaching efficiency of
Cu is higher when the inoculation ratio is 1:10.

The solution
potential was controlled during the leaching process.
The dissolution differences of the two pure minerals at solution potentials
of 640 mV and 800 mV were investigated. The results are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

Figure 2 Leaching efficiency variety of chalcocite and pyrite with time
at 640 mV of solution potential and 30 °C (the initial pH value
is 1.8).

Figure 3 Leaching efficiency variety of chalcocite and
pyrite with time
at 800 mV of solution potential and 30 °C (the initial pH value
is 1.8).

As shown in Figures 2 and 3, with the change
of the solution potential,
the leaching efficiencies of copper and iron ions are different obviously.
Changes of potential have little effect on the dissolution of chalcocite.
At 640 mV of solution potential, the leaching efficiency of Cu is
more than 75%, while the leaching efficiency of Fe is only about 5%
on day 20. At 800 mV of solution potential, the leaching efficiency
of Cu is close to 90%, and the leaching efficiency of Fe increased
above 40%. It can be inferred that the solution potential has a significant
effect on the selective leaching of chalcocite. A lower solution potential
is helpful for selective dissolution of chalcocite.

2.2 Effect of Bacteria on Leaching Process of
Mixed Pure Minerals
Due to the existence of Fe3+/Fe2+ pairs, Fe3+ in the solution can simultaneously
promote the oxidation of Cu+ in chalcocite and Fe2+ in pyrite, and promote the dissolution of the two minerals in the
leaching system. The ratio of Fe3+/Fe2+ pair
will be affected by the release of Fe2+ from pyrite dissolution,
and the potential of the solution will be affected. Therefore, it
is helpful to understand the selective leaching mechanism of chalcocite
by mixing pure minerals of pyrite and chalcocite and studying the
leaching characteristics of the mixed ore.

The chalcocite/pyrite
mixed pure minerals with a mass ratio of 1:2 were leached at 30 °C
for 14 days. The variation of metal ion leaching efficiency and solution
potential with time is shown in Figures 4 and 5.

Figure 4 Leaching efficiency
variety of chalcocite and pyrite with time
(the initial pH value is 1.8 and the inoculation ratio is 1:10).

Figure 5 Solution potential variety of mixed pure minerals with
time.

It can be seen from Figure 4 that the presence of bacteria
has different effects on the
leaching efficiency of copper and iron from mixed pure minerals. When
there were no bacteria in leaching, because of the higher electrostatic
potential of pyrite, the contact between pyrite and chalcocite would
produce a galvanic effect, which would inhibit the dissolution process
of pyrite as the cathode.21 The dissolution
of pyrite and chalcocite was promoted after bacterial inoculation.
With the presence of bacteria, the potential of the solution increases
from 260 mV to about 550 mV after 14 days of bioleaching (Figure 5). This indicates
that the oxidation of Fe2+ in the solution and mineral
surface by bacteria increases the potential of the solution, accelerates
the mineral dissolution rate, and then increases the difference of
leaching efficiency between two sulfide ores due to the galvanic effect.

Therefore, bacteria can promote the dissolution of mixed pure minerals,
and the selective dissolution of chalcocite can be achieved by controlling
the potential of the solution.

2.3 Varieties
of Microbial Community Structures
during Selective Leaching
2.3.1 Response of Microbial
Community Structures
on Different Sulfide Minerals
The structures of the microbial
community absorbed on the leached sample of different sulfide ores
were analyzed by the sequencing strategy PE300. The results are shown
in Figure 6. Original
represents the starting strain. Pyrite and chalcocite represent the
microbial communities in the leaching solution of the two pure minerals,
respectively.

Figure 6 Frequency of genus in microbial communities from bioleaching
solution
of pure minerals after 14 days of bioleaching (original represents
the starting strain).

The results in Figure 6 show that the dominant
genera in the starting strain are
classified into Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus, and Sulfobacillus, which have strong oxidation
ability toward iron and sulfur. Leptospirillum is
the dominant bacterium in pyrite leaching, while Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus are the dominant bacteria in
chalcocite leaching. The proportion of Sulfobacillus is higher. It can
be inferred that the dissolution of pyrite is mainly promoted by the
oxidation of low-valent iron by Leptospirillum, while
the dissolution of chalcocite is mainly promoted by the oxidation
of low-valent sulfur by Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus.

2.3.2 Response of the Community
Succession on
Solution Potential
The leaching experiments of secondary
copper sulfide samples were carried out in a stirred tank reactor.
The effect of the solution potential on the leaching efficiency of
Cu from copper sulfide ore samples was investigated. The results are
shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Leaching
efficiency variety of Cu and Fe ions with solution potential
after 14 days (the initial pH value is 1.8 and the inoculation ratio
is 1:10).

The initial solution potential
is 370 mV. Figure 7 shows that the Cu in the sample has obvious
selective dissolution characteristics when the solution potential
is controlled. When the solution potential is greater than 700 mV,
the Cu leaching efficiency is greater than 75%, while the Fe leaching
efficiency is only about 6%. Although the Cu leaching efficiency reached
about 80% above 700 mV, the Fe leaching efficiency rapidly increased
to more than 30%. Therefore, the selective leaching of chalcocite
is effective when the solution potential is controlled below 700 mV.

The structure of the microbial community absorbed on the leached
sample at different solution potentials was analyzed by the sequencing
strategy PE300. The results are shown in Figure 8. Samples are represented by numbers 1–6.
The potential of sample 1 is not controlled during leaching, and the
potential is higher than 840 mV. The solution potential of samples
2–6 are controlled to be 800, 760, 700, 640, and 600 mV, respectively.

Figure 8 Frequency
of genus in microbial communities of copper sulfide ores
at different potentials after 14 days of bioleaching (1–6 represent
the samples from different potential control conditions).

As shown in Figure 8, the structures of microbial communities change greatly at
different
potentials. At 840 mV, the dominant bacteria is mainly Leptospirillum, whose proportion decreases rapidly at lower potential. It was reported
that Leptospirillum ferriphilum was
the dominant iron(II)-oxidizer in later stages of leaching.22,23 At 700 mV or a lower potential, the proportion of Leptospirillum decreases to almost 0, and is mainly replaced by Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus.

It can be inferred that
the iron oxidizing ability of the community
dominated by Leptospirillum at high potential is
stronger. The increased dissolution rate of pyrite leads to more iron
ions and is not conducive to the extraction and separation of copper
from the leaching solution. Conversely, the sulfur oxidation ability
of the community dominated by Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus at low potential is stronger. The two bacteria
are conducive to the selective dissolution of chalcocite. It was reported
that in pyrite bioleaching of Acidithiobacillus,
the thiosulfate leads to sulfate without S formation.24 Obviously, the presence of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria also
eliminates the effect of sulfur in leaching.

2.4 Semiconductor Band Theory Analysis of Selective
Leaching of Chalcocite
Based on the density functional theory,
the crystal models of chalcocite and pyrite were constructed using
the program CASTEP. Structural optimizations and electronic property
calculations were also performed. The crystal structures is shown
in Figure 9. There
are Fe–S bonds and S–S bonds in the pyrite cell, and
only Cu–S bonds and Cu–Cu bonds in the chalcocite cell.

(B) pyrite.

2.4.1 Analysis of Mulliken
Population
Mulliken population is a method proposed to show
the distribution
and bonding of electric charges between constituent atoms, which characterizes
the distribution, transfer, and bonding properties of electrons between
atoms. When the population is greater, the covalent bonds formed between
the atoms are stronger. Conversely, for a smaller population, electron
clouds have a small degree of overlap and the bond exhibits ionicity.
The atomic coordination of the two minerals are shown in Figure 9. Mulliken population
analysis focuses on bonds formed by atoms around vacancies. The populations
of ideal and defective pyrite and chalcocite are listed in Tables 3 and 4.

In Table 3, with
the presence of Fe vacancy in the pyrite crystal, the length of most
Fe–S bonds increases slightly, the population decreases from
0.48 to 0.43, and the bonds covalency are stronger. The length of
the S–S bond increases slightly with a little change of the
population. In the pyrite crystal with S vacancy, the lengths of most
Fe–S bonds increase slightly and the populations remain unchanged.
The length of the S–S bond decreases slightly, while the population
increases from 0.31 to 0.35, and the bond covalency is also stronger.
The above results show that the surface of pyrite with Fe vacancy
has stronger hydrophilicity than ideal pyrite.18 The presence of vacancy enhances the atomic activity in
the Fe–S bond, and reduce the reaction difficulty between pyrite
and electron acceptors such as O2 and Fe3+ in
the solution. The presence of S vacancy mainly weakens the activity
of S atoms in S–S bonds and increases the reaction difficulty
between pyrite and electron acceptors in the solution.

In Table 4, with
the presence of Cu vacancy in the chalcocite crystal, the lengths
of Cu–S bonds decrease significantly, the populations decrease
from 0.30–0.40 to 0.09–0.18, and the bond ionicity becomes
stronger. In the chalcocite crystal with S vacancy, the populations
of Cu–S bonds decrease to 0.12, with a stronger bond ionicity.
The length and population of Cu–Cu bonds in chalcocite with
vacancy have no directional variation trend. The above results show
that the surface of chalcocite with Cu or S vacancy has stronger hydrophilicity
than ideal chalcocite. The presence of vacancies enhances the atomic
activity in Cu–S bonds and reduces the reaction difficulty
between chalcocite and electron acceptors in the solution. It is difficult
to bond between S atoms in chalcocite.

2.4.2 Analysis
of Density of States (DOS)
The band structure and atomic
density of states (DOS) of two mineral
cells are shown in Figures 10 and 11. The value of the Fermi level
is set at 0 eV.

Figure 10 DOS of atoms on different types of pyrite. (A) ideal crystal;
(B)
Fe vacancy crystal; (C) S vacancy crystal.

Figure 11 DOS
of atoms on different types of chalcocite. (A) ideal crystal;
(B) Fe vacancy crystal; (C) S vacancy crystal.

In Figures 10 and 11, the DOS at the Fermi level is close to 0. Therefore,
the crystals mainly exhibit semiconductor properties. As shown in Figure 10, the valence band
of pyrite from −17 to −10 eV is mainly contributed by
the S 3s orbital, followed by the Fe 3d, Fe 4s, and S 3p orbitals,
and the Fe 4p orbit has the least contribution. The energy range from
−8.0 to −1.5 eV below the top of the valence band is
mainly contributed by Fe 4s and S 3p orbitals. Among them, S 3p orbital
contributes more, followed by the Fe 4s orbital. The Fe 3d orbital
in the valence band near the Fermi level contributes more and the
activity of Fe atoms are stronger. With the presence of Fe and S vacancies,
the DOS of pyrite from 0.4 to 3.5 eV is less than ideal pyrite, and
the atomic activity of Fe increases, which is consistent with the
results of Mulliken population analysis. S vacancy also leads to an
increase of DOS at the Fermi level and a decrease of the energy gap,
which enhances the metallicity of pyrite.

As shown in Figure 11, the valence band
of chalcocite from −15 to −13 eV
is mainly contributed by the S 3s orbital, followed by the S 3p orbital.
The energy range from −7.0 to 0 eV below the top of the valence
band is mainly contributed by Cu 3d and S 3p orbitals. The Cu 3d orbital
in the valence band near the Fermi level contributes more and the
activity of the Cu atoms are stronger. With the presence of Cu and
S vacancies, the DOS of chalcocite from −7.5 to 0.5 eV is less
than ideal chalcocite, and the atomic activity of Cu and S increases.
The Cu and S vacancies in chalcocite lead to a decrease of the bond
energy of copper and S from −7.5 to 0.5 eV, and an increase
of the activity of copper and S atoms. The S vacancy also leads to
an increase of DOS and a decrease of the energy gap at the Fermi level.
S vacancy also leads to an increase of DOS at the Fermi level and
a decrease of the energy gap.

2.4.3 Analysis
of Band Theory in Selective Dissolution
of Chalcocite
Previous studies showed that at the higher
Fermi level than the ORP of the solution, the electrons would migrate
from the semiconductor to the solution and the electron-deficient
region would be formed on the semiconductor surface.25,26 The Fermi levels of chalcocite and pyrite were calculated by Dmol3. The results are shown in Table 5.

Table 5 Calculated Value
of Fermi Levels of
Chalcocite and Pyrite
minerals	the calculated
value (eV)	
pyrite (ideal)	–5.690	
pyrite (Fe vacancy)	–5.638	
pyrite (S vacancy)	–5.621	
chalcocite (ideal)	–4.555	
chalcocite (Cu vacancy)	–4.539	
chalcocite (S vacancy)	–4.446	
As shown in Table 5, the Fermi levels of ideal chalcocite and ideal pyrite
are −4.56
eV and −5.69 eV, respectively. Fe, Cu, and S vacancies raise
the Fermi level of chalcocite and pyrite. The increase of the Fermi
level is beneficial to the transfer of electrons from the mineral
surface to the solution, and to the adsorption of dissolved oxygen
on the surface. With the increase of the hole on the surface, S2– and S are more easily oxidized to SO42–. This causes the formation of more hydrophilic groups
on the surface of the two sulfide ores and the acceleration of mineral
dissolution. No matter what vacancy exists, there are significant
differences between the Fermi levels of the two minerals. The band
gap width of pyrite is about 0.95 eV, while that of chalcocite is
about 1.1 eV.27,28 Based on the Fermi level data
in Table 5, the schematic
diagrams of the energy band structure of chalcocite and pyrite are
drawn in Figure 12.

Figure 12 Energy band structure of chalcocite and pyrite including the solution
energy level. EF, Ec, and Ev represent Fermi energy,
valence band maximum, and conduction band minimum, respectively. The
subscripts Fe, S, and i represent Fe vacancy, S vacancy, and ideal
crystal, respectively.

In semiconductor physics,
the energy level of the standard hydrogen
electrode (SHE) can be determined to be −4.5 eV. The relationship
between energy level E and solution potential Eh can be expressed by eq 1.29 1  In bioleaching, the solution potential
fluctuates
in the range of 250–850 mV (vs SHE). The energy level corresponding
to the potential is between the Fermi level of chalcocite and pyrite.
According to the Nernst equation, when the ratio of Fe3+/Fe2+ changes from 10–3 to 103, the corresponding energy levels of potential change from −5.45
to −5.09 eV. The energy levels of the solution and Fe3+/Fe2+ pairs are also shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12 shows
that the Fermi level of ideal pyrite (−5.69 eV) is lower than
the energy level of the solution (−4.75 to −5.35 eV)
without adding bacteria. Electrons can migrate from the solution to
the pyrite surface and form an electron accumulation zone. At a lower
solution potential (Figure 5, about 330 mV), the energy difference between the top of
the pyrite valence band and the solution (about 1.04 eV) is greater
than the width of the pyrite gap (0.95 eV). Therefore, it is difficult
to form electron holes at the top of the valence band, and the apparent
dissolution rate of pyrite is relatively low (Figure 4). The Fermi level (−4.56 eV) of ideal
chalcocite is greater than the energy level of the solution. Electrons
can easily migrate from the chalcocite surface to the solution. The
formation of more holes on the surface of chalcocite promotes the
fracture of the Cu–S bond, which shows a higher apparent dissolution
rate (Figure 4).

Fermi levels of pyrite and chalcocite increase with the presence
of vacancies in both crystals. For pyrite, it is easier to form holes
on the Fe–S bond and the dissolution rate of pyrite increases.
For chalcocite, the rate of electron migration from the Cu–S
bond to the solution accelerates. Chalcocite tends to further transform
into covellite and dissolve.

With the presence of bacteria, Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus oxidize
low-valent sulfur to
S0, S2O32–, and
SO42– and assist the oxidation of Fe2+, which increases the ratio of Fe3+/Fe2+ and the solution potential. When the energy level of the solution
crosses the bottom energy level of the ideal pyrite conduction band
(−4.92 eV) and approaches the top energy level of the valence
band (−5.87 eV), the electron holes at the top of the valence
band increase, and the dissolution rate of pyrite also increases.
At the same time, the loss of electrons at the top of the ideal chalcocite
valence band brings a large number of holes. Cu+, which
moves to the solid–liquid interface continuously is oxidized
to Cu2+ by dissolved oxygen and Fe3+ of the
solution. When the potential is not controlled, the concentration
of Fe3+ and the potential of the solution will continue
to increase. Above 800 mV, Leptospirillum becomes
a dominant group, rapidly oxidizing Fe2+ and leads to the
increase of the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio continuously.
It is difficult to inhibit the dissolution of pyrite.

If vacancies
exist in pyrite and chalcocite crystals, Leptospirillum will replace Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus as the dominant group earlier because of the higher Fe2+ concentration in the solution.

If the potential of the solution
is controlled at a lower level
(<700 mV or −5.2 eV), the oxidation extent of Fe2+ by Leptospirillum is limited, and the concentration
of Fe3+ in the solution is relatively low. Chalcocite is
selectively dissolved by oxygen and a small amount of Fe3+ in the solution. Because of the presence of Fe, Cu, and S vacancies,
the Fermi level of real minerals is higher than ideal. Therefore,
the solution potential should be controlled at 600 mV or less to ensure
the selective dissolution of chalcocite.

Accordingly, we can
consider the feasibility of treating the secondary
sulfide ore by two-stage bioleaching. In the first stage of bioleaching,
ORP is maintained below 600 mV, so that chalcocite is completely converted
to covellite and some copper ions, and the iron leaching amount is
controlled at a low level. In the second stage, the separation of
covellite and pyrite is considered to realize the effective control
of the iron ion concentration in the leaching solution. The kinetic
investigation of the two-stage dissolution process of chalcocite also
supports this view indirectly.30

3 Conclusions
Through bioleaching and first-principles
method analysis of secondary
copper ores and pure minerals, the mechanism of selective dissolution
of chalcocite in bioleaching was explained.

For pure minerals,
the leaching efficiency of copper from chalcocite
was higher than pyrite at the same leaching time. Controlling the
solution potential at a lower level was beneficial to the selective
leaching of chalcocite. For mixed pure mineral, bacteria increased
the leaching efficiency of metal ions from pyrite and chalcocite simultaneously
by oxidizing Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the solution.

Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus were the dominant group in the
leaching of chalcocite, and the proportion of Sulfobacillus was higher. Leptospirillum was the dominant bacterium
in the leaching of pyrite. Below 700 mV of solution potential, the
bacterial community, mainly consisted of Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus, had a stronger promotion on
the selective dissolution of chalcocite.

In bioleaching, the
solution energy level was higher than ideal
pyrite but lower than ideal chalcocite, which resulted in the accumulation
of electrons on the surface of pyrite and the formation of holes at
the top of the chalcocite valence band. When bacteria assisted the
oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and caused the raise
of the solution potential, the difference between the solution energy
level and the top of the pyrite valence band would be smaller than
the width of the pyrite energy gap. Then, the holes at the top of
the pyrite valence band increased. The acceleration of pyrite dissolution
provided more Fe2+ for Leptospirillum.
Below 700 mV, the assistances of Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus on the oxidation of Fe2+ were weak, and the concentration of Fe3+ was relatively
low. Chalcocite was selectively dissolved by oxygen and a small amount
of Fe3+ in the solution.

Because of the presence
of Fe, Cu, and S vacancies in real minerals,
the surface of chalcocite and pyrite had stronger hydrophilicity than
ideal minerals. The atomic activity in the Cu–S bond and the
Fe–S bond enhanced, and the reaction difficulty between minerals
and electron acceptors in the solution reduced. Real minerals had
smaller energy gaps and higher Fermi levels. Leptospirillum could replace Acidithiobacillus and Sulfobacillus as the dominant group at 600 mV or more. Therefore, the solution
potential should be controlled at a lower level to ensure the selective
dissolution of chalcocite.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Samples
The secondary copper sulfide
sample was obtained from the Zijinshan Copper Mine of Fujian Province
of China. The particle size of the sample was less than 2 mm. Pure
minerals of pyrite and chalcocite were obtained by separating and
enriching from raw ore through hand sorting, gravity separation, and
flotation. Pure minerals were all ground and sieved to minus 0.074
mm.

The bacteria used in the experiment were collected from
the sump pit of ore heap of Zijinshan Copper Mine. After 4 to 5 days’
breeding and domestication in the laboratory, the bacteria with good
tolerance on copper and iron ions were obtained. Bacteria were cultured
on 9 K medium. The optimum growth temperature of the bacteria is 30–45
°C, and the optimum pH value is about 1.2–2.5.

4.2 Leaching Experiments
The copper sulfide
sample and pure minerals were ground and sieved to minus 0.074 mm,
respectively. The leaching experiments of pure minerals were carried
out in conical flasks. A certain amount of samples and 9 K medium
were added into the conical flask. The pH of the solution was adjusted
to a certain value between 1.8 and 2.0 with 20% (v/v) sulfuric acid
and ensured that the initial pH of the solution in the conical flasks
was the same so that the initial solution potential was roughly the
same. The initial inoculated cell density was 2 × 107 cells/mL. The inoculation ratio (volume ratio of bacterial liquid
to pulp) in conical flasks were 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5, respectively.
In the process of leaching, the pH and potential of the solution were
measured every day, and the concentration of copper and iron ions
in the supernatant were measured every 3 days. After leaching, residues
were filtered and dried. The leaching experiments of copper sulfide
samples were carried out in a stirred tank reactor, as shown in Figure 13. The reactor could
detect the solution pH value and ORP online and control the potential
by filling different gases during the leaching process. Before every
leaching, the pulp concentration was adjusted to 5%. In the leaching
process, the stirring speed was 120 rpm, and the temperature was controlled
in the range of 30–35 °C. The pH range of the solution
was the same as that of pure mineral leaching experiment. After leaching,
residues were filtered and dried.

the pH and potential of the solution.

4.3 Model of Crystal Structures of Minerals
Based on the density functional theory, the calculations were performed
using the programs CASTEP and DMol3. Structural optimizations
and electronic property calculations were performed using CASTEP and
GGA-PW91.16,17 The valence electrons (Fe 3d64s2, S 3s23p4, and Cu 3d104s2) were considered using ultra-soft pseudopotentials.18 A plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff
of 270 eV was employed for the geometry optimization. A Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling density of 2 × 2 × 2 mesh was used.19,20 The convergence tolerances for
geometry optimization calculations were set to the maximum displacement
of 0.002 Å, the maximum force of 0.08 eV Å–1, the maximum energy change of 2.0 × 10–5 eV/atom
and the maximum stress of 0.1 GPa, and the self-consistent field (SCF)
convergence tolerance was set to 2.0 × 10–6 eV/atom. The spin-polarization was used for all calculations. Properties
were calculated with the same parameters as geometry optimization.
The Fermi levels of crystals were calculated by Dmol3,
with the GGA-PW91 method, DNP basis set, effective core potentials,
a fine quality, and SCF convergence threshold of 1.0 × 10–6 eV/atom.

4.4 Analytical Techniques
The chemical
compositions were confirmed by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF,
XRF-1700, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using a standardless quantitative
analysis method and chemical analyses. Microscopic observation and
analysis of element distribution in leaching residues were conducted
using a mineral liberation analyzer, which included a scanning electron
microscope (JSM-7001F, Japan Electron Optics Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan)
and an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (INCA X-Max,
Oxford Instruments, Oxford, U.K.). Potential and pH of the leaching
solution were determined by the pH/ORP meter (Seven Excellence S400,
Mettler Toledo, Zurich, Switzerland) and a Pt electrode with reference
to a Ag/AgCl electrode. All of the potential values mentioned were
normalized to the hydrogen scale in this work. The concentrations
of Cu2+ and total iron were determined by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectrometry (725-Agilent Technologies, California).

The leaching efficiency E of metal ions were calculated
by eq 2. In the equation, C is the concentration of metal ions, V is the volume of the solution, α is the grade of the metal, m is the mass of ore samples, and M is
the molecular weight 2  

Microorganisms were harvested
from 5.0 mL representative leaching
solutions. The cells were centrifuged at 12000g for
10 min for cell collection. Total DNA was extracted using the PowerWater
DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN China Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). DNA quality
assessment and quantification were conducted using a NanoDrop ND-1000
Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE). PCR
was conducted on Applied Biosystems (ABI) Veriti 96-well Fast Thermal
Cyclers with bacterial primer pair (341 F of the forward primer and
805 R of the reverse primer) for the V3-V4 region of the 16 S rRNA
gene.31,32 Each sample was amplified under the following
conditions: 94 °C for 5 min, 28 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s,
62 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, then 10 min at 72 °C.
PCR products were purified using the EZNA Gel Extraction Kit (Omega
Bio-tek). The library quality was assessed on the QuantiFluor-ST (Promega).
Then, the library was sequenced on an Illumina Miseq platform (Majorbio,
Shanghai) with the sequencing strategy PE300. The sequencing datasets
of bacteria and fungi have been deposited in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (accession
No. PRJNA555796).

4.5 Data Analysis
All sequence processing
and diversity estimates were performed using the QIIME. To obtain
clean tags, low-quality sequences and chimeras were filtered, trimmed,
and removed.33 Most of the sequence lengths
after quality control were between 450 bp and 460 bp. High-quality
nonchimeric sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) using a 97% similarity threshold and the uclust algorithm with
optimal uclust settings. The taxonomy of OTU representative sequences
was phylogenetically assigned to taxonomic classifications by the
RDP Classifier with a confidence threshold of 0.8.34 All experiments were performed at least three times. Each
data point and error bar represented the mean and standard deviation,
respectively.
