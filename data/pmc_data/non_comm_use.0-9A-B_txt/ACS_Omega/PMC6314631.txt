Starlike branched polyacrylamides
(SB-PAMs) were synthesized using
reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer copolymerization
of acrylamide (AM) and N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide)
(BisAM) in the presence of 3-(((benzylthio) carbonothioyl)thio)propanoic
acid as a chain transfer agent, followed by chain extension with AM.
The amount of incorporated BisAM in the core and the amount of AM
during chain extension have been systematically varied. Core structures
were achieved by incorporation of total monomer ratios [BisAM]/[AM]
ranging from 0.010 to 0.143. The obtained macromolecular chain transfer
agents had weight average molecular weights in the range of (2.2–7.8)
× 103 Da and polydispersity indices between 1.2 and
15.1. Kinetic experiments were performed to investigate the extent
of control of polymerization. Finally, the expansion of the core structures
by chain-extension polymerization resulted in the successful preparation
of high molecular weight SB-PAMs with apparent molecular weights ranging
from 19 to 1250 kDa.

Introduction
Polyacrylamide (PAM)
and its derivatives are widely used in cosmetics,
biomedical applications, and wastewater treatment, amongst others.1−3 Hereby, the main purpose (mostly in aqueous solution) of the polymer
is to enhance the solution viscosity and consequently to improve its
rheological properties.4 Nowadays, however,
there is an increasing demand for more specific polymer structures
with even higher complexity.5 In that matter,
complex polymeric structures consisting of different designs and molecular
architectures including block, graft, brush, star, and hyperbranched
(hb) polymers have attracted much attention.6,7 Specifically
interesting are star, branched, and hb polymers, because of their
unique rheological and physical properties in aqueous solutions compared
to their linear analogues.6,8−11 Traditional synthetic routes such as free-radical, anionic, cationic,
and group transfer polymerizations are unsatisfactory, in particular,
to prepare unconventional PAMs, because stringent control over reagent
purity and reaction conditions is indispensable.7 In fact, the reactions are characterized by low control
over the molecular weight distribution (MWD) and chain architecture.12 In contrast, however, living/controlled radical
polymerization techniques, such as atom transfer radical polymerizations
(ATRP),4,13−16 nitroxide-mediated polymerization,17,18 and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization,19 amongst others,20 have proven to be versatile in synthesizing a wide range of polymer
architectures.21−24 Star or starlike copolymers have been studied extensively and are
well documented in the literature.11,22,25,26 When preparing the
materials from multifunctional initiators,15 the final product is very well characterized. However, for industrial
upscaling, this might not be the most suitable approach because of
the high cost of such molecules. In this context, the use of a bifunctional
monomer and thus the core/arm approach is much more attractive. The
preparation of such architectural structures by RAFT polymerization
can be achieved via the “arm-first” (AF) or “core-first”
(CF) approach24,27,28 or via combinations.29 In the AF approach,
linear polymer chains are first synthesized and later attached to
a core via copolymerization with a divinyl comonomer.27,30 In contrast, the CF approach makes use of a multifunctional initiator,
which is commonly referred to as the macro chain transfer agent (mCTA)
or macro RAFT agent.22 Those hb-cores are
formed by cross-linkage of the monomer and comonomer [a cross-linker
or a branching agent (BA)] in each repeating unit,6 while the RAFT functionality remains within the core moiety.23,31 The process is driven by intermolecular reactions between the chain-end
radicals and the pendant double bonds,26 which in turn generates “randomly” branched polymers.27,32 Consequently, the core (macro RAFT agent) is further used to synthesize
starlike polymers by chain extension with conventional vinyl monomers
[acrylic acid or acrylamide (AM)] in the presence of multifunctional
RAFT agents.32 Recently, the preparation
of hb polymers as core moieties has been reported via RAFT copolymerization
of di(ethylene glycol) methacrylate and ethylene glycol diacrylate
as the BA in the presence of benzyl pentanoate as the CTA.33 Similarly, Perrier et al. documented the synthesis
of “core-first” branched polymers by using ethylene
glycol dimethacrylate as a cross-linker and different vinyl monomers.30

In this article, we report our results
on the investigation on
the RAFT copolymerization of AM with N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BisAM) as the BA, followed by
chain extension with different levels of AM addition to obtain water-soluble
starlike branched polyacrylamides (SB-PAMs). Detailed experimental
work on the effect of the synthesized branched molecular architectures
and the degree of branching in relation to rheology is shown in a
follow-up paper.34 In that paper, macromolecular
properties of the polymers are related to enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
performance and are evaluated in EOR simulations.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
AM (electrophoresis grade, ≥99%),
BisAM (≥99%), 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (ACVA,
≥98.0%), cyclooctane (≥99.5%), and sodium chloride (NaCl,
≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
3-(((Benzylthio)carbonothioyl)thio)propanoic acid (BCPA) was synthesized
according to the literature.8,35 However, further purification
of BCPA was performed by recrystallization twice from dichloromethane,
obtaining the RAFT agent as a yellow solid powder with 66% yield.
All other chemicals were of reagent grade and used without further
purification.

Synthesis of the Macro RAFT Agent (mCTA)
A 25 mL round-bottomed
flask was charged with the acrylamide monomer, AM (e.g., Table 1, entry 1: 0.5783
g, 8.136 mmol), divinyl monomer, BisAM (0.0128 g, 0.083 mmol), RAFT
agent, BCPA (0.0703 g, 0.258 mmol), and initiator, ACVA (0.0358 g,
0.128 mmol) (in that order). The monomers, RAFT agent, and initiator
were dissolved in a mixture of sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer solution
(pH = 5) and ethanol (50:50 vol %) before addition to the reaction
mixture. The use of this solvent ensures the solubility of all components.
After addition of a magnetic stirrer, the system was degassed by purging
with nitrogen gas (N2) for at least 30 min under vigorous
stirring (1050 rpm) and subsequently sealed. After deoxygenation,
the system was placed in an oil bath at 70 °C to initiate polymerization.
All reactions were performed under nitrogen. After a given reaction
time, the mixture was exposed to ambient air and diluted with demineralized
water (5 mL) to terminate the reaction. A sample of 0.3 mL was taken
from the solution mixture for determination of AM conversion by gas
chromatography (GC) and the molecular weight and weight distribution
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). To isolate the polymerized
macro RAFT agent, the solvent (buffer solution/ethanol mixture) was
evaporated at low pressure (<100 mbar). The yellowish, gel-like
product was dissolved in sufficient demineralized water (typically
a few drops). Afterward, the reaction mixture was precipitated in
an excess amount of methanol. Hereafter, the precipitated product
was decanted and filtered over a 0.45 μm filter element by using
a vacuum pump. The solid residue was then dried in an oven at 70 °C.
The detailed reaction conditions for the synthesis of the macro RAFT
agent are summarized in Table 1. The linear mCTA (entry 13) was synthesized under similar
conditions. GPC traces of the obtained macro RAFT agents are reported
in the Supporting Information file.

SB-PAM Polymerization
A 250 mL three-necked
flask was
charged with the macro RAFT agent (e.g. Table 2, entry 1: 0.0502 g, 0.156 mmol), monomer,
AM (5.0009 g, 0.070 mol), and initiator, ACVA (0.0024 g, 0.086 mmol)
which were dissolved in sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer solution
(20 mL) at pH = 5. Subsequently, the system was purged with nitrogen
gas (N2) under vigorous stirring (1050 rpm) for at least
30 min. After degassing, the system was placed in an oil bath at 80
°C to initiate the reaction. All reactions were performed under
nitrogen. During the reaction, the mixture of the reactants transitioned
from yellowish to a whitish gelatine-like homogeneous paste. The viscosity
of the solution visibly increased with time. After a given reaction
time, the mixture was exposed to ambient air and diluted with demineralized
water to terminate the reaction. A sample of 0.3 mL was taken from
the reaction mixture for the determination of AM conversion by GC
and the molecular weight and weight distribution by GPC. Afterward,
the product was precipitated by washing the polymer in an excess amount
of methanol. Subsequently, the precipitated polymer was decanted and
dried in an oven at 70 °C. The linear polymer (entry 19) was
synthesized under similar conditions.

Characterization
AM conversion was determined using
GC. Hereby, the reaction mixture samples (0.3 mL) were precipitated
in acetone solution with 1000 ppm of pentadecane (reference). The
precipitated polymer solution was filtered to remove the solid and
injected on a Hewlett Packard 5890 GC system with an Elite-Wax ETR
column. The theoretical molecular weight (Mtheor.) was calculated, according to the literature,12,22,35 as follows 1  where Mtheor. is
the theoretical molecular weight of the synthesized polymer, M0,AM and M0,BisAM are the initial monomer concentration of AM and BisAM, respectively,
(mol), M0,RAFT is the initial concentration
of the RAFT agent (mol), MAM is the molecular
weight of the AM monomer, MBisAM is the
molecular weight of the BisAM monomer, MRAFT is the molecular weight of the RAFT agent, and X represents the monomer conversion. GPC was performed with an Agilent
1200 system with Polymer Standard Service (PSS) columns (guard, 100
and 3000 Å, 8 × 300 mm). A 50 mmol sodium nitrate (NaNO3) aqueous solution was used as the eluent. GPC samples were
dissolved in 50 mM sodium nitrate (with Milli-Q water) prior to injection.
The elution was conducted at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min at 40 °C.
Linear PAM standards were used for baseline calibration with WinGPC
software (PSS) to calculate the apparent molecular weight and polydispersity
index (PDI) of the GPC samples. The chemical structure of macroCTA
and chain-extended samples was confirmed by 1H NMR. The
spectra were recorded on Varian Mercury Plus 400 MHz. D2O was used as the solvent.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of the Macro RAFT Agent
The synthesis of
the macro RAFT agent, as outlined in Figure 1, was performed by copolymerization of a
vinyl monomer (AM) and divinyl comonomer (BisAM) at constant amounts
of CTA (BCPA) via RAFT, generating “core-like” branched
macromolecular structures (macro RAFT agent). The amount of BisAM
was altered by changing the total monomer ratio of [BisAM]/[AM], ranging
from 0.010 to 0.143. The pH was maintained at 5 during polymerization
to prevent hydrolysis of the CTA.22,23,36 The properties of the macro RAFT agent are given
in Table 1. For all
entries, the ratio of monomer to CTA to initiator, [AM + BisAM]/[CTA]/[I]
was maintained constant at 64/2/1, except for entry 1, where the ratio
was 32/2/1. 1H NMR spectra (see Supporting Information) confirm the formation of the PAM macro CTA, evidencing
the incorporation of BCPA moieties and residual pendant double bonds
from BisAM. Higher initial BisAM/AM ratio resulted in higher amount
of pendant double bonds; however, an accurate quantification was not
possible because of overlapping and broadening of the peaks. The molecular
weight averages (Mn), determined by GPC
analysis were between (2.2 and 7.8) × 103 and PDIs
were between 1.2 and 15.1 (Table 1). The GPC traces (see Supporting Information) show that the MWD becomes broader and multimodal
as the BisAM/AM ratio increases. As it can be noted here, Mn,theor. is always lower than Mn,GPC. The theoretical molecular weight is calculated
through the conversion values, based on GC analysis. In this context,
the observed differences might be due to the accuracy of both techniques
and to the differences in hydrodynamic volumes. Furthermore, some
samples have such a high PDI that the average value represents a mere
indication. In any case, for the linear polymer (entry 13 in Table 1), the discrepancy
is roughly 20%, the lowest among all samples. As suggested by an anonymous
reviewer of this work (whom we wish to acknowledge), the systematically
higher than calculated Mn can also suggest
a not optimal efficiency of the controlling functional groups, resulting
in a lower than calculated growing polymer chains and, as a consequence,
a higher than calculated molecular weight. This may be ascribed to
the engulfing of the reactive chain ends at the early stage of core
formation, preventing some of them from effectively reactivating chain
growth in the second stage; another option could be some side reactions,
such as core–core coupling, resulting in deactivation of a
fraction of the RAFT-active groups. This would also be compatible
with the increase of PDI with Mn (Table 1). The amount of BisAM,
as the BA in the copolymerization system, significantly influenced
the branching capability of the prepared macromolecules. The total
monomer conversion was high throughout all experiments with average
values of 94.6 ± 3.6%. Similar observations were reported by
Vo and co-workers,37 Perrier’s group,30 Wang et al.,27,38 and Taton
et al.,32 amongst others.39−41 The cross-linker concentration shows a substantial effect on the
growth of molar mass of the branched copolymers. From the results,
it can be seen that the deviation from an apparent linear equivalent
molecular weight increases and broader MWDs occur at increased BA,
suggesting prominent branching and/or cyclization reactions.38 Previously published articles report that with
significantly more than one divinyl comonomer per chain (high BA),
macrogelation occurs.30,32,37,42 However, this is only valid at fixed CTA
values. In fact, it is frequently reported in the literature that
much higher BA content can be incorporated into the polymeric structure
when [CTA]/[BA] ratios >0.5 are used to effectively suppress the
macrogelation
process.6,37,42−46 In this context, Li et al. investigated the effect of the critical
overlap concentration (C*) of polymers on cyclization
by preparation of water-soluble cationic branched copolymers via quaternization.47 The latter concentration is the threshold for
interaction or overlapping of the domains of polymer chains and is
a function of the molecular volume and radius of gyration.48 The authors conclude from their model system
that intramolecular (primary) cyclization is strongly favored with
relatively high proportions of a divinyl comonomer (BA) if the corresponding
monomer/polymer concentration is comparable to or lower than C*.47 The authors argue that
the overlap concentration causes an interpenetration of associating
polymeric coils, which in turn favors primary cyclization. The results
of several studies, confirm this theory.32,49 In the present study, however, all copolymerizations were conducted
with 14–15 wt/vol %, while the estimated C*, according to Li et al., is 5 wt/vol % for an AM/BisAM copolymerization
system.47 In fact, the obtained results
can be interpreted in relation to pronounced primary cyclization reactions,
causing the broadening of the MWD. Hence, intramolecular cyclization
reactions dominated over intermolecular branching reactions at increased
BA concentrations.

Synthesis of the SB-PAM
Copolymers
The synthesis of
SB-PAMs was performed according to Figure 2a, using different amounts of AM (5 g: entry
1–11, 10 g: entry 12–15, and 15 g: entry 16–18)
(Figure 2b) with the
branched macromolecular cores (macro RAFT agents) listed in Table 1. A linear reference
polymer (entry 19) was prepared. The experimental conditions are presented
in Table 2. Soluble
polymers were produced in all entries with maximum achievable monomer
conversion of 89.9% (entry 5). The used mCTA amount was fixed at 0.5
g, whereas the initiator amount for the SB-PAMs was based on 0.5 mol
% of the specific average molecular weight of the macro RAFT agent
because the trithiocarbonate functionality remained in the core.23 The experimental molecular weight of entry 1–4
(PDI < 2) was directly determined by the GPC analysis. For entry
5–18, the experimental molecular weight falls outside the measurable
range of the GPC and thus could not been determined with reliable
accuracy. The GPC is calibrated based on well-defined linear AM standards
with Mn up to 465 000, rendering Mn of entries 5–18 outside the range of
the calibration standards. Because of these limitations, we can only
use the Mn and PDI values obtained by
GPC as merely indicatives of a qualitative trend. However, we can
observe from Table 2 that in the lower range of Mn, the measured
values are systematically higher than the calculated ones. This is
in line with what is observed for the cores and it can be ascribed
to the inefficiency of the RAFT controlling groups. As Mn increases well above the column limit, this trend cannot
be observed anymore, but it is very likely that GPC significantly
underestimates these values. Moreover, the hydrodynamic volume of
SB-PAMs is reported to be smaller than their linear counterparts because
of the compactness of branched polymers.4 Nevertheless, for studying the effect of AM concentration and the
effect of the mCTA with more precision, GPC traces are presented for
a series of selected SB-polymers, such as entry 2, 9, 10, and 11 (Figure 3), entry 2, 4, 6,
8, and 10 (Figure 4), entry 9, 12, 15, and 16 (see Supporting Information), and entry 16, 17, and 18 (Figure 5).

An increase of incorporated BA (in the core moiety) leads
to bimodal
weight distributions and more pronounced high molecular weight shoulders
(Figure 3: only for
entry 9 and 10). This could be due to the fact that the cores with
higher BisAM/AM ratio already present multimodal MWD (see Supporting Information file). According to Zhu
et al., this effect can also originate from random-branched polymers
having randomly distributed primary chains,50 while another explanation is a star–star coupling reaction
(side reaction).51 Star–star coupling
is a termination reaction taking place between two free “arm”
macro radicals.52 The bimodal MWD was reported
in comparable studies conducted by Wang et al.27,53 The apparent monomodal distribution observed for entries 11–18
could simply be ascribed to higher molecular weight and longer branches.
The growth of the molecular weight shoulder (Figure 4) might be related to the increased amount
of cross-linker concentration, resulting into more branching points
and ultimately causing the double-star by coupling of two PAM arms
(long-chain branching52).27 Indeed, all other entries present monomodal MWDs, which
in contrast to the former reveals the typical behavior of a star-shaped
polymer, with randomly distributed primary chains.50 Increasing the amount of AM (e.g., entry 12 and 16) favored
star polymer formation with higher molecular weights. The MWD seems
to become narrower, but because the values of molecular weight obtained
for these polymers are higher than the detection limit of the column,
these could be artifacts. As a confirmation of the reached limit for
the column, apparent molecular weights for entries 16–19 are
very similar (Figure 5). Fröhlich and co-workers studied possible shielding effects
on the formation of star-shaped polymers via RAFT polymerization.
Besides the common steric congestion,51 the authors documented that steric crowding (expansion of the core)
can be of significance. Consequently, the formation of longer chains
around the core, as well as the compactness of the core causes termination
reactions.54 In theory, cores with higher
BA content should form systems with a higher number of branches, but
because of the mentioned crowding and termination (also evidenced
by broader MWD), probably less and longer chains are formed. To further
investigate the kinetics of polymerization, an experiment with 0.7
mol AM and a macro RAFT (core moiety) containing a BisAM/AM ratio
of 1:11 was performed. In Figure 6a, the monomer conversion, PDI, and molecular weight
GPC are displayed, while in Figure 6b, the pseudo first-order kinetic plot for polymerization
is illustrated. From Figure 6b, nonlinearity can be observed, which indicates the occurrence
of termination reactions.55 Given the conditions
of the experiment and taking into account previously obtained results,
the nonlinearity as well as the increase of Mn at constant conversion (Figure 6c) probably arises from star–star
coupling reactions. The kinetic data, together with the GPC traces
(Figure 7), showing
the development of bimodal distribution during polymerization, suggest
that, even though the PDI remains narrow (and actually decreases)
with conversion, polymerization is not a completely controlled process,
in line with previously reported synthesis of hb polymers via RAFT.30

Conclusions
SB-PAMs have been successfully prepared
by RAFT copolymerization
of AM with BisAM as BA, in the presence of a CTA BCPA followed by
RAFT chain extension with various levels of AM. The BA was effectively
incorporated into the core moiety with total monomer ratios [BisAM]/[AM]
ranging from 0.010 to 0.143. The obtained macromolecular branched
cores (mCTA) had weight average molecular weights in the range of
(2.2–7.8) × 103 Da and PDIs between 1.2 and
15.1 at high monomer conversions of 94.6 ± 3.6%. The increasing
PDI value is argued to be the result of dominant intramolecular cyclization
reactions due to increased BA concentration. Chain extension polymerization
with varied levels of AM showed that an increase in the monomer (AM)
to macro RAFT agent (mCTA) ratio results in higher average molecular
weights with high monomer conversions. GPC traces elucidated the formation
of high molecular weight shoulders, as a result of star–star
coupling reactions of two PAM arms. Detailed experimental work on
the effect of the synthesized branched molecular architectures and
the degree of branching in relation to rheology is shown in a follow-up
paper.34 There, macromolecular properties
of the polymers are related to EOR performance and are evaluated in
EOR simulations.
