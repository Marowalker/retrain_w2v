In this work, Pseudomonas
cepacia lipase immobilized on cellulosic polyurethane
was used as a catalyst
for biodiesel production via trans-esterification reactions in order
to provide cost-effective methods of enzyme recycling. The efficacy
of the immobilized enzyme catalyst at low loading (6.2 wt %) and the
effects of temperature, water content, and reaction time in model
trans-esterification of glyceryl trioctanoate were investigated extensively.
It was found that water was necessary for the reaction of glyceryl
trioctanoate with ethanol to proceed. A high conversion of glyceryl
trioctanoate (∼70%) was obtained at 35 °C, with only 5.0
wt % of water content over a reaction period of 12 h.

Introduction
Availability and fluctuating
costs of fossil fuels continue to
drive research into new biofuel production and associated biomass
conversion technologies. The use of bioderived diesel, namely, fatty
acid alkyl esters, has been extensively studied and validated for
use as a replacement and/or supplement to traditional fossil-derived
diesel, in part, because of its comparatively straightforward preparation.
Biodiesel production is achieved through catalytic trans-esterification
of vegetable oils, animal fats, or microalgal oils with alcohols including
methanol,1,2 ethanol,3,4 1-propanol,5 and 2-butanol,6 a
procedure needed in order to provide the necessary physical properties
of the fuel to ensure engine compatibility.7

Currently, these required trans-esterification processes are
undertaken
mainly using soluble alkaline metal-based catalysts, for example,
sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, potassium hydroxide, or potassium
methoxide, which give fast diffusion and reaction kinetics.8 However, in the presence of the dissolved metal
cations, saponification of free fatty acids also occurs, which lowers
yields of the target bioderived diesel. In contrast, although inorganic
acid-catalyzed trans-esterification reactions for biodiesel production
(using, e.g., HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4) are possible and not strongly affected by the presence of
free fatty acids,9 industrial use of acid-catalyzed
processes is problematic because of slow reaction rates and the corrosive
nature of the acid. Furthermore, both homogeneous acid- and base-mediated
biodiesel manufacturing processes are hindered by the difficulty in
separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture, something that
is not only an issue for downstream use of the bioderived diesel itself
but also for the recovery of the coproduced glycerol, which is an
increasingly important commodity chemical in its own right.10

In order to circumvent some of the problems
surrounding soluble
acid- and base-mediated trans-esterification reactions, a range of
alternative heterogeneously catalyzed trans-esterification strategies
for bioderived diesel production have been explored, with enzymatic
catalysts having started to emerge as promising candidates, although
their application remains in its infancy.11 This nascent method of enzyme-mediated trans-esterification for
biodiesel production has recently been reviewed by Norjannah.12 In this area, the use of lipase triacylglycerol
acylhydrolase (EC 3.1.1.3) has received considerable interest, as
it has been shown to catalyze both the hydrolysis of triglycerides
and trans-esterification reactions, thus potentially leading to a
reduction in the number of necessary process steps required for bioderived
diesel manufacture.13−16 Indeed, a number of studies have explored the production of biobased
diesel mediated by lipases, in particular with enzymes such as Pseudomonas cepacia and Candida antarctica.17,18 Importantly, in contrast to traditional
homogeneous chemical trans-esterification methodologies, enzyme-promoted
trans-esterification is achieved at neutral pH, something that eliminates
corrosive waste streams, prevents by-product soap formation, and facilitates
both bioderived diesel and glycerol recovery. Additionally, the overall
life cycle for enzymatic routes to bioderived diesel has relatively
low energy consumption compared with traditional acid- or base-catalyzed
trans-esterification reactions.8 However,
in general, the catalytic performance of enzymes is significantly
poorer than that achieved using soluble base catalysts, such as sodium
hydroxide or potassium methoxide.19 Furthermore,
appropriate choice of reactant alcohol is crucial because methanol
is known to act as a strong inhibitor of lipase catalytic activity
and to decrease the enzyme’s stability.20,21 For example, Shimada et al. have reported that during studies of
immobilized C. antarctica-mediated
trans-esterification of vegetable oil, methanol led to complete enzyme
deactivation.22

An additional disadvantage
of enzyme-mediated trans-esterification
is the high cost of lipases, something that is further compounded
by the fact that their recovery and reuse are difficult. Therefore,
in order to provide cost-effective methods of enzyme recycling, efforts
have been made to prepare and utilize solid-supported lipases. To
this end, a range of inorganic particles,23,24 natural macromolecules,25−27 and polymers28,29 have been explored as supports for lipases, with many diverse immobilization
methods having been developed, such as adsorption,30,31 covalent binding,32 affinity immobilization,33,34 and entrapment.35,36 Choosing the most suitable immobilization
method has become an important factor for increasing enzymatic trans-esterification
efficiency; potential support materials and methods for lipase immobilization
have been recently reviewed by Datta et al.37

Cellulosic polyurethane has received particular attention
as an
appropriate support material because of its demonstrated biocompatibility,
as well as its hydrogen bond-forming potential, which can enhance
its mechanical and surface properties.38 For example, hydrophilic cellulosic polyurethane variants [possessing
poly(ethylene adipate)diol units] favor enzyme loading by adsorption
compared with related materials with relatively hydrophobic surfaces
bearing poly(propylene)glycol motifs.39 Such hydrophobic supports have been shown to reduce enzymatic activity
as a result of unfolding of the hydrophobic core of the enzyme toward
the surface of the support.40

Thus,
with a view to developing a recyclable immobilized enzymatic
catalyst for bioderived diesel production via trans-esterification,
in this paper, we describe the immobilization of P.
cepacia lipase (PCL) on cellulosic polyurethane by
adsorption and explore the efficacy of the resulting heterogeneous,
supported enzyme as a catalyst in model trans-esterification reactions,
exploring the effects of temperature, water content, and reaction
time. In this study, PCL was regarded as the enzyme of choice because
it has previously been reported that P. cepacia is reasonably tolerant toward methanol, a substrate of particular
importance in commercial fatty acid upgrading to bioderived diesel.41

Results and Discussion
Cellulosic
polyurethane provided by Sea Marconi is made from hemicellulose
cross-linked by diisocyanate linkages. The resulting material has
both hydroxyl and urethane groups on its surface, which can be used
as potential sites through which enzymes may be grafted, offering
a means of accessing a heterogeneous catalyst of relevance to trans-esterification
reactions. Consequently, with a view to generating an immobilized
form of the enzyme P. cepacia, a portion
of this cellulosic polyurethane material was treated, under appropriate
conditions, with the lipase and the resulting material subsequently
tested in catalytic trans-esterification reactions.

Analysis of Polymer-Supported
PCL
A high immobilization
yield of PCL of 88.0% is obtained, which was calculated by measuring
the difference in the PCL concentration of the supernatant before
and after the immobilization process. Attempts were subsequently made
to analyze the resulting material by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy because it has been shown to be a powerful tool for assessing
the conformation of lipase via the three amide signature bands:44 1645 cm–1 (C–O stretch),
1583 cm–1 (N–H bend and C–N vibration),
and ∼1434 cm–1 (N–H bend, C–C
and C–N vibrations).43 The FTIR
spectra of cellulosic polyurethane and cellulosic polyurethane-immobilized
PCL samples are shown in Figure 1. However, the vibrational bands for the urethane bonds
of cellulosic polyurethane overlap those of the lipase amide bands,
which make it difficult to use FTIR to confirm the conformation of
the immobilized PCL, although the spectra do show the presence of
PCL on the cellulosic polyurethane.

(− black) and cellulosic
polyurethane-immobilized PCL sample (− red).

In order to further confirm the presence of the
lipase on the polymeric
support material, the morphologies of the cellulosic polyurethane
before and after PCL immobilization were investigated using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 2(2) shows the immobilized PCL attached to the surface
of the polymer as spherical particles with a broad size distribution,
something attributed to the formation of lipase aggregates.45,46 These spherical features were not observed on the pure cellulosic
polyurethane.

polyurethane-immobilized
PCL (2).

Effect of Temperature and
pH on the Hydrolytic Activity of Immobilized
PCL
Before the immobilized PCL was used as a catalyst for
trans-esterification, the effects of temperature and pH on its hydrolytic
activity were investigated and compared with those from identical
studies using the free lipase. The effect of temperature on the hydrolytic
activity of free and immobilized lipases for p-NPP
hydrolysis at pH 7.0 over the temperature range of 25–65 °C
is shown in Figure 3(1). It was found that the hydrolytic activity of PCL decreased after
immobilization, something that is attributed to the restricted conformational
mobility of the enzyme structures on the support surface compared
with free lipase.47,48 The hydrolytic activity of free
PCL starts to decrease when reaction temperatures above 35 °C
are employed, although notably, immobilized PCL retained its hydrolytic
activity up to 55 °C, but for reactions conducted above this
temperature, a decrease in their performance occurs. It is proposed
that this loss in efficacy is not a result of leaching, rather it
is attributed to the restricted conformational mobility of the enzyme
structures following immobilization on the cellulosic support surface,
which makes the enzyme sensitive to the increased temperature. Consequently,
if the immobilized PCL was subject to leaching at this temperature,
then this would lead to a relatively high hydrolytic activity. Whether
this effect took place was explored through an analysis of the stability
of the polymer support at 55 °C for 16 h as studied by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) (see the Supporting Information for details). Application of this heating cycle resulted only in
a 3.1% of weight loss, which indicates that the polymer material used
as the PCL support is very stable at 55 °C.

Figure 3 (1) Effect of temperature
on the hydrolytic activity of free PCL
at pH 7 (a) and immobilized PCL (b) and (2) effect of pH on the hydrolytic
activity of free PCL (a) and immobilized PCL (b). p-NPP = p-nitrophenylpalmitate.

The impact of pH on the catalytic activity of the immobilized
PCL
was studied at 30 °C over the range of pH 5.0–9.0, with
the results being shown in Figure 3(2). Here, the best hydrolytic activity is achieved
between pH 5.0–7.0, albeit with levels lower than that achieved
using the free lipase. Further increase in the reaction pH leads to
a significant attenuation in the hydrolytic activity of the immobilized
PCL. This is attributed to alteration of intermolecular interactions
of the lipase, such as dispersion and H-bonding between the enzyme
and the polymer support, which result in deleterious conformational
changes of the enzyme, as reported previously.43,49

In summary, from the data presented in Figure 3, it is evident that first, the free PCL
is slightly more hydrolytically active than the immobilized PCL across
the temperature and pH ranges tested. Second, the reactivity of the
immobilized PCL is more sensitive to both temperature and pH than
that of the free PCL. Because the hydrolytic activity of the immobilized
PCL may potentially be attributed to leaching of PCL from the support
and thus it may be expected that if leaching has occurred, then, the
highest leaching may align with the highest conversion activity at ∼pH
5–7. Consequently, to explore this issue, a PCL leaching experiment
was performed at pH 7.

Leaching of PCL
Tests to probe the
influence of PCL
leaching from the support upon catalytic activity were carried out
in a phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.0, under stirring at 200 and
500 rpm at 35 °C for 24 h. After both tests, no PCL was detected
in the supernatant liquid, which indicates that PCL was firmly immobilized
on the cellulosic polyurethane.

Catalytic Trans-Esterification
Reactions
In prior studies,
it has been reported that P. cepacia is reasonably tolerant of methanol poisoning, in contrast to other
readily available enzymes such as Candida rugosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens.41 However, this was not found to be the case for
our new immobilized PCL, although it should be noted that the previously
reported experiments with free enzyme were not repeated because our
work was focused purely on improving the reusability of PCL through
immobilization. Incubation of the immobilized PCL was undertaken with
either methanol or ethanol at 30 °C for 24 h, prior to hydrolytic
activity testing. It was found that although the catalytic activity
of the immobilized PCL was inhibited significantly by methanol, no
inhibition was observed with ethanol. Additionally, a number of test
reactions (reaction of glyceryl trioctanoate with methanol catalyzed
by the immobilized PCL) were carried out to verify the reproducibility
of the catalytic tests. It was found that in each case, the conversion
of the starting glyceryl trioctanoate in these test reactions was
very low, less than 5.0%. As such, we propose that the immobilized
PCL is somehow being inhibited by methanol. Thus, because we clearly
demonstrate that any such inhibition process is significantly reduced
when using ethanol in the place of methanol, our subsequent work reported
in this paper focused exclusively on reactions of glyceryl trioctanoate
with ethanol. Here, an excess of ethanol was used in order to maximize
conversion (glyceryl trioctanoate/ethanol = 1:4). The mass ratio of
glyceryl trioctanoate/immobilized PCL was kept at 20:1 for all reactions.

It has been reported that water has a strong influence on the catalytic
activity and stability of lipase for lipase-catalyzed trans-esterification,
especially when reactions are undertaken in predominantly nonaqueous
media. The water is believed to play multiple roles including mass
transfer of substrates and products, enhanced nucleophilicity and
proton transfer at the active site, and solvent shell-mediated dynamics
for accessing catalytically competent conformations.50,51 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that lipase catalytic activity
generally depends on the available interfacial area of the immiscible
organic–water interface, which can be increased by the addition
of water.52 Because glyceryl trioctanoate
and water are indeed immiscible, catalytic tests were undertaken using
the immobilized PCL in the presence of 5.0 and 10 wt % of added water;
the results are presented in Figure 4. Significantly higher conversions of glyceryl trioctanoate
were obtained for reactions performed with 5.0 wt % of water, than
those achieved with 10.0 wt % of water. It is believed that this is
a competitive reaction and that this effect can be attributed to fast
hydrolysis of the acylenzyme intermediate, which is initially formed
in the reaction before it can be trapped by ethanol. Furthermore,
catalytic tests employing 5.0 wt % of water were essentially unaffected
by changes in temperature. In contrast, at 10 wt % of water content,
conversion decreases as temperature is also increased. Consequently,
an optimum water content is required to maximize the lipase activity
as has been demonstrated previously for the trans-esterification reaction
of canola oil catalyzed by immobilized Thermomyces
lanuginosus.53

Figure 4 Results of
trans-esterification of glyceryl trioctanoate with ethanol
performed over 24 h at various temperatures with () 5.0 wt % and () 10.0 wt % of water. The
mass ratio of glyceryl trioctanoate to catalyst was 20:1, and the
molar ratio of glyceryl trioctanoate to ethanol was 1:4.

Subsequently, a detailed investigation was carried
out probing
glyceryl trioctanoate/ethanol trans-esterification with different
water contents, which were varied between 0 and 15.0 wt % at 35 °C
for 24 h; results are shown in Figure 5. Notably, only 4.7% conversion of glyceryl trioctanoate
was achieved in the absence of water. Substrate conversion increased
significantly to 42% when the water content was only increased slightly
to 1.0 wt % and increased to 77% in the presence of 2.5 wt % of water.
Indeed, good conversions of glyceryl trioctanoate were obtained when
the water content lies in the range between 2.5 and 7.5 wt %. By way
of comparison, a blank test was carried out in the absence of immobilized
PCL at 35 °C for 24 h with 5.0 wt % of added water, which leads
to only 2.6% conversion of glyceryl trioctanoate, confirming the role
of immobilized PCL in catalyzing trans-esterification.

Figure 5 Effect of water content
on trans-esterification of glyceryl trioctanoate
with ethanol at 35 °C for 24 h. The mass ratio of glyceryl trioctanoate
to catalyst was 20:1, and the molar ratio of glyceryl trioctanoate
to ethanol was 1:4.

A number of prior studies
have concluded that trans-esterification
of triglycerides catalyzed by lipases in the presence of optimal quantities
of water occurs in two stages, as illustrated in Scheme 1.17,54 It is believed that initial triester hydrolysis occurs releasing
glycerol, forming an acyl-enzyme intermediate in which the acyl moiety
of the substrate is transiently attached to a hydroxy group of the
enzyme. Subsequently, the acyl-enzyme intermediate is trapped by ethanol
and forms the ethyl octanoate product. This is consistent with our
observed dependence of catalysis on maintaining an optimal water content.

Scheme 1 Suggested Pathway for Trans-Esterification Reactions of Glyceryl
Trioctanoate with Ethanol Catalyzed by the Immobilized PCL Catalyst
To Produce Ethyl Octanoate
Because a relatively high conversion of glyceryl was obtained
at
35 °C for 24 h with 5.0 wt % of H2O, the conversion
of glyceryl trioctanoate with ethanol was investigated with different
reaction times under the same process conditions. Subsequently, the
conversion of glyceryl trioctanoate was found to be relatively low
over the first 3 h of reaction (44%), but increased to 73% after 12
h (Figure 6). Increasing
the reaction time further to 24 h led only to an additional 14% substrate
conversion. Consequently, all further catalytic tests for the trans-esterification
of glyceryl trioctanoate mediated by immobilized PCL were performed
for a period of 12 h. The relatively low degree of substrate conversion
and long reaction time of these initial studies indicate that the
immobilized PCL is considerably less active for catalyzing trans-esterification
than traditional homogeneous base catalysts. It is noteworthy, however,
that in the present study, the immobilized PCL was used with a relatively
low lipase loading of 6.2% and, furthermore, the mass ratio of glyceryl
trioctanoate to immobilized PCL was kept relatively low, at 20:1.
In contrast, it has been reported that a relatively high conversion
of soybean oil can be achieved but this occurs only with a higher
PCL loading of ∼13.6% and a lower mass ratio of soybean oil
to immobilized PCL of 10:3.52

Figure 6 Results of
trans-esterification of glyceryl trioctanoate at 35
°C with 5 wt % of water as a function of reaction time. The mass
ratio of glyceryl trioctanoate to catalyst was 20:1, and the molar
ratio of glyceryl trioctanoate to ethanol was 1:4.

Because the primary rationale for choosing an immobilized
form
of PCL for this type of trans-esterification reaction was to enhance
the catalyst stability and to facilitate its separation from the reaction
mixture and subsequent reuse, recycling tests using the immobilized
PCL system were carried out. This screening was undertaken at 35 °C
for 12 h with 5 wt % of water, with a constant mass ratio of glyceryl
trioctanoate to immobilized PCL of 20:1. After each reaction, the
catalyst was separated by filtration and washed thoroughly with water
and then freeze-dried prior to reuse; immobilized PCL was recycled
four times, and the catalytic performance was recorded (Figure 7). After the first recycling
test, the conversion of glyceryl trioctanoate decreased by 11.9%,
with then a further 8.3 and 6.5% decrease from the second and third
recycling tests, respectively. The conversion of glyceryl trioctanoate
dropped by 42% after four reuse cycles. Although the origins of the
loss in activity are not readily apparent, we propose that this may
be attributed to washing after each recycling test or catalyst inhibition
resulting from the presence of the intermediate product, octanoic
acid. Further studies are needed to understand the factors affecting
the longevity of the immobilized PCL.

PCL for trans-esterification

Conclusions
This
preliminary study exemplifies that enzyme-mediated trans-esterification
of triglycerides can offer an environmentally benign, process-efficient
option for bioderived diesel production through improved ease of separation
of catalyst from the reaction, coupled with an acid-/base-free waste
stream. In this study, PCL was successfully immobilized on cellulosic
polyurethane, with the resulting system showing good thermal stability
and moderate water tolerance. The immobilized PCL was successfully
used as a catalyst, at low loading (6.2 wt %), for trans-esterification
of glyceryl trioctanoate with ethanol. It was found that water was
necessary for the conversion of the triester, with acceptable conversions
of ∼75% being obtained at 35 °C, with 5.0 wt % of water
and a reaction period of 12 h. This preliminary catalysis performance
data indicate the promise of immobilized enzymes in bioderived fuel
production. However, more research is required to understand why the
immobilized PCL is more sensitive to methanol than ethanol. Similarly,
the origins of the relatively quick deactivation of the immobilized
PCL over the four repeat recycling test needs to be better understood,
in particular looking at the potential for catalytic inhibition by
reaction products. Building on these results, immobilized PCL will
be used as the catalyst for trans-esterification of extracted nonpolar
microalgal oil in future research.

Experimental Section
Catalyst
Preparation
PCL with activity ≥30 000
U/g, Triton X-100, p-nitrophenylpalmitate (p-NPP), bovine serum albumin, glyceryl trioctanoate, ethyl
octanoate, and dihexyl ether were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium
phosphate (tribasic) and sodium carbonate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich,
and 4-nitrophenol and phosphoric acid from Alfa Aesar. BCA protein
assay reagent A and Piercei BCA protein assay reagent B were purchased
from Thermo Scientific. Cellulosic polyurethane was kindly donated
by Sea Marconi Technology SAS, Italy. Deionized water was used to
prepare all aqueous solutions, unless stated otherwise.

In order
to remove possible residual impurities from the cellulosic polyurethane,
the material (2 g) was incubated with ethanol (20 mL) for a period
of 20 h at 25 °C, followed by a thorough washing with potassium
phosphate buffer solution (60 mL, 0.01 M, pH 7, 0.1% (v/v) Triton
X-100). The resulting pretreated polymer support was added to a PCL
solution (30 mL, 5 mg/mL in a potassium phosphate buffer solution)
and the mixture incubated at 30 °C for 24 h, during which time
the vessel was shaken at 150 rpm. Subsequently, the mixture was separated
by centrifugation (4000 rpm) at 15 °C for 15 min. The resulting
polymer-immobilized lipase material was washed thoroughly with potassium
phosphate buffer to remove any unbound lipase, followed by vacuum
drying of the solid material for 24 h, which was then stored at 5
°C until required. The supernatant removed by centrifugation
was combined with the washings; the concentration of residual (Cx)-free PCL in this solution was then determined
using the BCA protein assay method.42 The
immobilization yield was calculated by measuring the difference in
the PCL concentration of the supernatant before (C0) and after (Cx) the immobilization
process according to the following equation  

The PCL concentrations in the supernatant before and after
immobilization
were 5 mg/mL and 580.3 μg/mL, respectively. This corresponds
to an immobilization yield of PCL of 88.0% and hence to a lipase loading
on the cellulosic polyurethane of 6.2% by mass.

Instrumentation
FTIR spectra were recorded from 800
to 2000 cm–1 on a PerkinElmer 1600 Series instrument
with 8 cm–1 resolution. Electron micrographs were
obtained using a Hitachi SU70 analytical scanning electron microscope.
TGAs were conducted using a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA, purged with air.
Gas chromatographic (GC) analyses were performed with a Shimadzu GC-2014
gas chromatograph with an AOC-20i auto injector and an AOC-20s auto
sampler, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary
column (HP-5, length 30 m, ID 0.25 mm and film thickness 0.25 μm);
H2 was used as the carrier gas. The column was heated with
a temperature profile of 40–300 °C at 20 °C/min and
subsequently held for 2 min. The temperatures of the injection port
and FID were set at 230 and 305 °C, respectively.

Determination
of Immobilized PCL Hydrolytic Activity
Determination of the
hydrolytic activity of the immobilized PCL was
carried out according to the spectrophotometric protocol reported
by Dhake et al.43 Immobilized lipase (10
mg including the support) in potassium phosphate buffer solution (2.91
mL, 0.01 M, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100) was preheated to 30 °C,
then a p-NPP solution (80 μL of 20 mM, dissolved
in 2-propanol) was added to give a total volume for the mixture of
3 mL, which was then kept at 30 °C and stirred at 200 rpm for
5 min. Subsequently, Na2CO3 solution (1 mL,
0.1 M) was added to terminate the reaction. Finally, the solid component
was removed by centrifugation, and the absorbance at 410 nm due to
the release of p-nitrophenol into the supernatant
following the enzymatic hydrolysis of p-NPP was measured.
Each lipase activity assay was performed in triplicate, and mean values
are reported. For comparison, the hydrolytic activity of free lipase
was also tested. The same procedures were followed except that free
lipase was used as the catalyst instead of the immobilized PCL. The
amount of free PCL used for the hydrolytic activity test was calculated
according to the following equation  

Probing the Effect of Temperature
and pH on Free and Immobilized
PCL Stability
The temperature stability of the free and immobilized
PCL was studied by incubation (for 60 min) with potassium phosphate
buffer solutions (pH 7.0) at 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65 °C, followed
by a hydrolytic assay (in triplicate) as detailed in the above section.

The effect of pH on free and immobilized PCL stability was investigated
by incubating samples at 30 °C for 30 min in phosphate buffer
solutions (2.91 mL, 0.01 M K3PO4/H3PO4, with 0.1% Triton X-100) at pH values from 5.0 to
9.0, followed by hydrolytic assay, which were performed in triplicate
and mean values reported. The masses of free lipase and immobilized
PCL used were the same as detailed in the above section.

PCL Leaching
Test
Leaching of immobilized PCL from
the support was investigated in phosphate buffer solution (3 mL) at
pH 7.0. Separate suspensions of immobilized PCL (10 mg) were stirred
at 200 and 500 rpm for 24 h, followed by centrifugation. The lipase
concentration in the supernatant was tested using the BCA method.

PCL-Catalyzed Trans-Esterification Reactions
A screw-capped
glass vial (14 mL) was charged with glyceryl trioctanoate (1.43 g),
immobilized PCL catalyst (71.7 mg), with the mass ratio of glyceryl
trioctanoate/catalyst = 20:1, and an amount of ethanol (molar ratio
of glyceryl trioctanoate/ethanol = 1:4) and either 5 or 10 wt % of
water. When the molar ratio of glyceryl trioctanoate/ethanol was set
at 1:4, a 55.0% conversion of glyceryl trioctanoate was obtained.
On increasing the molar ratio of glyceryl trioctanoate/ethanol from
1:4 to 1:6, the conversion of glyceryl trioctanoate only increased
by 1.5%. Accordingly, the molar ratio of 1:4 was applied to all following
reactions. In order to investigate the effect of reaction temperature
on the thermal stability of the immobilized lipase, a series of reactions
were performed at 30, 35, and 40 °C for 24 h. To further investigate
the effect of water on the catalytic activity of the immobilized lipase,
a set of tests were carried out with different water contents in ethanol
at 35 °C over a period of 24 h. It was found that immobilized
PCL shows good activity for trans-esterification of glyceryl trioctanoate
with ethanol at 35 °C when the water content was 5 wt %. Accordingly,
the conversion of glyceryl trioctanoate was investigated over different
reaction times, each performed at 35 °C with 5 wt % of water.
Blank experiments (without any immobilized PCL) were also carried
out at 35 °C with 5 wt % of water; the conversion of glyceryl
trioctanoate was only 2.6% over a period of 24 h in this blank test.
After each catalysis test reaction, the solid fraction was separated
by centrifugation. The resulting liquid fraction was diluted with
hexane to provide solutions for GC analysis, to which was added dihexyl
ether (0.45 mL) as an internal standard, prior to analysis.
