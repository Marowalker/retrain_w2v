The synthesis of
a highly porous composite of ZIF-67 and reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) using a simple stirring approach is reported.
The composite has been investigated as an electrode to be assembled
in a supercapacitor. In the presence of an optimized redox additive
electrolyte (RAE), that is, 0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4, the ZIF-67/rGO composite electrode
has combined the properties of improved conductivity, high specific
surface area, and low resistance. The proposed composite electrode
in the three-electrode system shows an ultrahigh specific capacitance
of 1453 F g–1 at a current density of 4.5 A g–1 within a potential window of −0.1 to 0.5 V.
Further, the ZIF-67/rGO composite electrode was used to fabricate
a symmetrical supercapacitor whose operation in the presence of the
RAE has delivered high values of specific capacitance (326 F g–1 at a current density of 3 A g–1) and energy density (25.5 W h kg–1 at a power
density of 2.7 kW kg–1). The device could retain
about 88% of its initial specific capacitance after 1000 repeated
charge–discharge cycles. The practical usefulness of the device
was also verified by combining two symmetrical supercapacitors in
series and then lighting a white light-emitting diode (illumination
for 3 min). This study, for the first time, reports the application
of a ZIF-based composite (ZIF-67/rGO) in the presence of an RAE to
design an efficient supercapacitor electrode. This proposed design
is also scalable to a flexible symmetric device delivering high values
of specific capacitance and energy density.

Introduction
The ever-growing environmental
concerns originating with the present
energy demands have motivated the researchers to develop alternative
technologies for energy conversion and storage. Lithium (Li)-based
rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors have received significant
attention in the above context. Li batteries demonstrate high energy
density but do not necessarily possess sufficient cycle life.1 On the other hand, supercapacitors are considered
as a good alternative in terms of high power delivery and long cycle
life but they usually deliver moderate levels of energy density.1−3 Therefore, the development of next generation supercapacitors demands
for the realization of both high energy and high power density features.
Such supercapacitors can be considered useful for various electronic
applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles, portable power supplies,
pulsed electronic devices, and so forth.2,4−6

The last decade has witnessed an enormous expansion in the
applications
of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in areas such as gas storage,
catalysis, biosensors, solar cells, and so forth.7,8 MOFs
are characterized with unique features of high specific surface area,
hierarchical pore size distribution, structural tailorability, and
high chemical and thermal stabilities.8,9 Recently, various
MOFs have also been advocated as potential electrodes in supercapacitors
on virtue of their highly porous structures.8 Nonetheless, most of the pristine MOFs bear poor electrical conductivity.
Consequently, MOF-based electrodes do not support efficient transfer
of charge to the current collector. This limitation of MOFs can be
overcome by forming their composites with other conductive materials
such as conducting polymers, graphene, and so forth. Because of the
presence of MOFs, such electrically conductive composites possess
a high surface area characteristic which is an advantageous factor
over a competitive electrode material, such as bare graphene, carbon
nanotubes, and other forms of carbon.

Salunkhe et al. have reported
the use of a composite of zeolitic
imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with polyaniline (PANI) as a supercapacitor
electrode (electrolyte = 1 M H2SO4).10 The electrode demonstrated a specific capacitance
value of 236 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1. The application of a composite electrode of UIO-66
with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in the presence of 6 M KOH as an
aqueous electrolyte has been demonstrated to yield a moderate value
of specific capacitance, (302 F g–1).11 However, this value of specific capacitance
was achievable only at a low current density, for example, 0.15 A
g–1. The functioning of a Mn–MOF-derived
Mn3O4/graphene composite electrode has been
proposed wherein the supercapacitor was able to yield a specific capacitance
of 456 F/g (1 A g–1).12 Xu et al. reported a ZIF-67/polypyrrole nanotube composite-based
electrode to attain a specific capacitance of 597.6 F g–1 at a current density of 0.5 A g–1 (electrolyte
= 1 M Na2SO4).13 Several
other MOF-based electrodes have also been proposed to design supercapacitors
with considerable levels of specific capacitance.14−20 As the literature survey has revealed, most of the MOF composite-based
supercapacitor studies have been carried out in the presence of aqueous
electrolytes. The assembly and complete device performance of those
systems have not been reported.

The characteristics of an electrode
material significantly influence
the output parameters such as specific capacitance, cyclic stability,
and energy and power densities of a supercapacitor. Simultaneously,
the electrolytes also play a big role to decide the overall performance
(e.g., energy density and cyclic stability) of a supercapacitor.21−23 Apart from the commonly used aqueous and organic solutions, some
redox active species such as K3[Fe(CN)6], hydroquinone,
and potassium iodide can be listed as alternative electrolytes.8,23−25 They can also be mixed with common aqueous electrolytes
(e.g., H2SO4, Na2SO4,
and KOH).26 In some studies, the use of
redox additive electrolytes (RAEs) has been suggested to enhance the
electrochemical performance of supercapacitors.8,27−29 Most of these studies have been carried out on graphene
and metal oxide/hydroxide electrodes-based supercapacitors.26,30,31 As per our knowledge, no previous
data are available to assess the performance of MOF or MOF composite-based
supercapacitors in the presence of RAEs.

The present work reports
a simple, stirring-based, environment-friendly,
and acid-free synthesis of a highly porous ZIF-67/rGO composite. ZIF-67
is a large surface area material (e.g., 947 m2 g–1) that, when mixed with rGO, has yielded the formation of a highly
porous and electrically conductive hybrid composite. The ZIF-67/rGO
composite introduces improved electron transport and electrolyte ion
diffusion characteristics as compared to the bare ZIF-67.32 In this work, we have investigated the application
of the ZIF-67/rGO composite as a supercapacitor electrode material
in the presence of an optimized RAE solution, that is, 0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4.
The use of the RAE is explored in view of its apparent advantages
as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Our studies have revealed
that the ZIF-67/rGO-redox system could deliver high values of specific
capacitance and energy density, supplemented with an excellent cyclic
stability. The studies have been extended to assemble a symmetrical
supercapacitor device using two identical ZIF-67/rGO electrodes. The
symmetrical supercapacitor has also delivered enhanced values of specific
capacitance and energy density compared to the earlier reported MOF-based
devices. Further, the device (series of two symmetrical supercapacitors)
has been demonstrated to energize a white light-emitting diode (LED).
As per the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report to
underline the excellent supercapacitor performance of a ZIF-composite
electrode/RAE system.

Results and Discussion
MOFs (including
ZIFs) are known for their high specific surface
area and hierarchical pore size distribution characteristics. The
hybrid structure of ZIF-67 with rGO should offer the synergistic benefits
of both components. The polyhedral-shaped crystals of ZIF-67 decorate
over the 2D rGO sheets and the resulting composite attains properties
of high surface area, porosity, capacitance, and enhanced charge transfer.
The detailed studies, as elaborated in the following paragraphs, outline
various characteristics of the ZIF-67/rGO composite along with its
potential use as an efficient supercapacitor electrode material.

The structure information and the crystal phase of the samples
were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of a reference (ZIF-67)
and the synthesized composite (ZIF-67/rGO) (Figure 1). Both the samples of ZIF-67 and ZIF-67/rGO
have shown characteristic diffraction peaks of the MOF. This observation
is indicative of a successful integration of ZIF-67 in the synthesized
composite.33−35 The notable peaks in the XRD pattern of ZIF-67/rGO
can be listed as: 7.2° (011), 10.4° (002), 12.7° (112),
14.7° (022), 16.4° (013), 18° (222), 22.1° (114),
24.5° (233), 25.6° (002), 26.5° (134), 29.6° (044),
31.3° (244), 32.5° (235), and 43.1° (100).33−35 In particular, a low intensity 2θ peak at 25.6° (002)
is an indicator of the presence of rGO (CCDC no. #671073).36 It may also be noted here that rGO is unlikely
to reflect many diffraction peaks due to its mono- to few-layered
structure.37 Nonetheless, the XRD analysis
has provided useful evidence about successful formation of the desired
nanocomposite of ZIF-67/rGO.33

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of ZIF-67/rGO and ZIF-67 samples.

ZIF-67 is a zeolitic type of MOF having a general formula
of Co(2-MeIM)2. The morphological characterization of the
samples (ZIF-67
and ZIF-67/rGO) has been performed with field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) analysis (Figure 2a,b). Figure 2a shows the morphology of ZIF-67, which indicates a 3D polyhedral
shape of the ZIF-67 particles with an average size of 500 nm. The
formation of the ZIF-67/rGO composite was evidenced with the apparent
uniform growth of the MOF crystals over the sheet-like surface of
rGO. TEM analysis of the sample also supports the formation of the
composite between ZIF-67 and rGO in which a crystal of ZIF-67 resides
over the rGO sheet [Figures 2c,d and S1 show a high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image]. The energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) analysis-based elemental composition of
the ZIF-67/rGO composite has been presented in Table 1, which confirms the presence of cobalt (from
ZIF-67) along with carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen contents.

As the morphological and microstructural analyses
with FESEM and
TEM suggest, the proposed approach to synthesize the ZIF-67/rGO composite
has resulted in the formation of the desired composite wherein the
structural features of both the components could be preserved. This
was important to ensure efficient charge storage through enhanced
transport of electrolyte ions inside the electrode material.8 The introduction of additional porosity owing
to the presence of ZIF-67 should facilitate the electrode material
with good supercapacitor performance.

Raman spectroscopy has
been used to study the vibrational modes
of samples under study (Figure 3a). These studies were carried out over a spectral region
of 200–1400 cm–1 under room temperature (RT)
conditions. The ZIF-67/rGO sample was characterized with two prominent
peaks at 1349 and 1579 cm–1, related with D and
G bands, respectively, of rGO nanosheets.38 It is well known that the D band correlates with the stretching
of C–C bonds and is common to all sp2 hybridized
carbon lattices. The D band is an also an indicator of the disorder-
and defect-induced breathing mode of sp2 rings.38 The intensity of the D band was larger than
the G band indicating the presence of defects in the rGO fraction
which might have been introduced during the chemical reduction step.
The appearance of some other peaks at 262, 424, 521, and 681 cm–1 can be associated with the presence of ZIF-67.35,39

Figure 3 (a)
Raman and (b) FTIR spectra of ZIF-67 and ZIF-67/rGO composites.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra of ZIF-67 and ZIF-67/rGO
are shown in Figure 3b. Both the samples showed a common band around 3450 cm–1 to signify the surface O–H stretching vibrations of the C–OH
group.34 The sample of rGO showed a main
band at 1662 cm–1 corresponding to epoxide which
helped us to verify the reduction of GO into rGO. A relatively less
intense band at 1662 cm–1 was due to the skeleton
vibration of rGO. No major signal related to (nonreduced) graphene
oxide (GO) [e.g., at 1220 cm–1 (C–O), 1621
cm–1 (C=O), 3400 cm–1 (O–H),
1415 cm–1 (C–O–H), 1732 cm–1 (C=O), and 1040 cm–1 (C–OC)] was
observed to confirm the presence of graphene as rGO. The bands related
with ZIF-67 appeared at 759, 996, 1142, 1304, 1428, and 1580 cm–1.33,40 The bands in the region of 600–1502
cm–1 corresponded to the bending and stretching
modes of ZIF-67, while a specific signal at 1580 cm–1 could be associated with the stretching modes of C=C and
C=N. Another band at 3135 cm–1 could be ascribed
to the stretching mode of C–H from the aliphatic chain in the
linker (2-methylimidazole). The presence of characteristic signals
from both rGO and ZIF-67 provided evidence of successful formation
of the ZIF-67/rGO composite.

The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of ZIF-67
and ZIF-67/rGO composites (performed at 77 K) are shown in Figure 4. The results for
rGO are summarized in Figure S2. Both the
samples of ZIF-67 and ZIF-67/rGO showed typical type-I surface area
profiles with microporous characteristics in majority (Figure 4a). The adsorption isotherms
showed a steep rise at low relative pressure and then quickly attained
a balance to suggest dominant microporous characteristic. The values
of specific surface area for ZIF-67, ZIF-67/rGO, and rGO were estimated
to be 947, 571, and 58.2 m2 g–1, respectively.
A significantly large specific surface area of ZIF-67 can be linked
with the presence of micropores.41Figure 4b shows the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
pore size distribution plots for the samples of ZIF-67 and ZIF-67/rGO.
The diameter of most of the pores was found to lie within the range
of 1–20 nm. The values of mean centered porosities for ZIF-67
and ZIF-67/rGO were assessed as 1.26 and 1.73 nm, respectively, which
verified their microporous characteristics.

and ZIF-67/rGO and (b) Pore size distribution plot for ZIF-67 and

In literature, significant
focus has been laid on the development
of new materials to achieve improved electrochemical performance of
supercapacitor devices. Some recent studies have highlighted the fact
that the selection of an appropriate electrolyte can also play a vital
role.8 For instance, the introduction of
redox additives in parent aqueous or organic electrolytes has been
suggested to produce enhanced supercapacitor performance.8,31 The application of such RAEs facilitates redox reactions on the
surface of the active electrode material, thereby leading to enhancement
in the pseudocapacitance of the system.42 In the present study, for the first time, we have investigated the
performance of a ZIF-67-based composite electrode in conjunction with
a RAE. For this, an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M Na2SO4 was mixed with a redox active species, that is, potassium
ferricyanide, in varying concentrations from 0.05 to 0.5 M. Amongst
various tested combinations, highest ionic conductance was realized
from a composition of 0.3 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1
M Na2SO4 (Figure S3). The addition of 0–0.3 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4 was found to boost the ionic
conductance of the resulting electrolyte with a maximum conductance
for 0.3 M K3[Fe(CN)6].

Based on some initial
tests, the desirable charging–discharging
conditions of the ZIF-67-redox or ZIF-67/rGO-redox supercapacitor
system were satisfactorily met with the application of 0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4 as
the optimized RAE composition. The use of K3[Fe(CN)6] in concentrations larger than 0.2 M did not allow complete
discharging of the supercapacitor system even at higher current densities.
Therefore, 0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4 was selected as the optimized composition of the RAE
for all other electrochemical studies. For a thorough evaluation and
comparison, in all studies, we have investigated the supercapacitor
performance of the ZIF-67 or ZIF-67/rGO electrode in the presence
of both 1 M Na2SO4 (reference electrolyte) and
0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4 (RAE).

The ZIF-67 or ZIF-67/rGO composite electrode
was first characterized
with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to probe its potential
as an electrode for supercapacitors. Nyquist plots have been used
to determine the values of series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), electric double layer capacitance (EDLC), and Warburg resistance
(W or Rw) (Figure 5). The electrode characteristics
were found better in the presence of RAE because of a faster rate
of electron transport and electrochemical reactions. ZIF-67 has a
relatively less conductivity in its native form. After the incorporation
of rGO, the ZIF-67/rGO electrode was characterized with lower values
of Rs and Rct (Rs = 3.9 Ω and Rct = 1.1 Ω) than the pristine ZIF-67 electrode (Rs = 4.7 Ω and Rct = 1.8 Ω). Apparently, the ZIF-67/rGO electrode was characterized
with a lower charge transfer resistance in the redox electrolyte.
This can be attributed to the formation of the [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– redox
couple that enhanced the ionic concentration (and conductivity) of
the system and allowed faster transport of more number of electrolyte
ions toward the surface of the active electrode material. As a result,
we observed a decrease in both the solution and charge transfer resistances.30,43

Figure 5 Nyquist
plots for ZIF-67 and ZIF-67/rGO electrodes in the presence
of the RAE (inset shows corresponding equivalent circuit).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge
discharge (GCD)
measurements have been performed to evaluate the specific capacitance,
energy density, and power density of the fabricated electrodes. Figure 6a shows the cyclic
voltammograms recorded during the functioning of ZIF-67/rGO electrodes
in the optimized composition of the RAE (0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4) at various scan rates
(100, 50, 20, 10, and 5 mV s–1) within a potential
range of −0.1 to +0.5 V. Comparative voltammograms with 1 M
Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte solution are shown
in Figure S4a. The ZIF-67/rGO electrode
has shown distinct anodic and cathodic peaks because of the Faradaic
nature of the ZIF-67 component. CV data were used to estimate the
values of specific capacitances (Cs, in
F g–1) according to the expression given in eq S1. Clearly, lower scan rates should yield
better values of specific capacitance because of the availability
of sufficient time for the electrolyte ions to undergo adsorption/desorption
at the electrode interface.8,44,45 (Figures 6a and S4a). The above comparative study also confirmed
that the ZIF-67/rGO electrode would yield much higher current values
in the presence of RAE. In comparison to the simple aqueous electrolyte,
the use of RAE was clearly beneficial to obtain a much improved value
of specific capacitance. For instance, for a fixed scan rate of 5
mV s–1, ZIF-67/rGO yielded a specific capacitance
of 562 F g–1 with the use of the RAE compared to
a value of 46.5 F g–1 obtained with the simple 1
M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte.

ZIF-67/rGO electrode at different scan rates,
and (b) comparative CV curves for ZIF-67/rGO and ZIF-67 electrodes
(scan rate = 5 mV s–1). Electrolyte = 0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4.

A similar positive effect with
the use of the RAE was also realizable
with the use of the bare ZIF-67 electrode as well (Figure 6b). The bare ZIF-67 system
yielded a specific capacitance value of 510 F g–1. Therefore, the abovementioned investigations have clearly highlighted
that the selection of RAE with the MOF/graphene composite electrode
should be more effective to achieve high values of specific capacitance
and energy density. The formation of the Fe(CN)63–/Fe(CN)64– redox couple happened to
be the major factor contributing toward enhanced pseudocapacitance
and energy density.23,30 The addition of the redox active
K3[Fe(CN)6] species in the parent 1 M Na2SO4 medium ensured extra density of charge carriers
(electrons). Both ZIF-67 and the ZIF-67/rGO electrodes showed distinct
anodic and cathodic peaks when they interacted with the redox electrolyte
(Figure 6b). This can
be attributed to the surface redox reactions that took place in the
presence of the redox electrolyte. Cobalt ions (of ZIF-67) undergo
different oxidation states via Faradaic reactions for the system to
deliver pseudocapacitive behavior.46 Subsequently,
overall conductivity of the composite electrode improved as a result
of faster electrochemical reactions.30 The
abovementioned combined effects synergized to facilitate a remarkable
electrochemical performance of the proposed ZIF-67/rGO-redox supercapacitor.

The contribution of rGO in the ZIF-67/rGO composite was also evident
in delivering a better specific capacitance (Figure 6b). The mixing of ZIF-67 with rGO introduced
conductive pathways to the electrode resulting in an improved electronic
transport between the composite electrode and its associated current
collector.

Along with CV, GCD analysis of a supercapacitor system
also allows
us to assess various important electrochemical parameters, for example,
specific capacitance and energy and power densities. The results of
GCD investigations for the ZIF-67/rGO electrode using both redox additive
and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolytes at various values
of current density are presented in Figures 7a and S4b. The
ZIF-67/rGO electrode delivered better electrochemical activity at
lower current densities in both the cases of redox additive and simple
aqueous electrolytes. The GCD profiles exhibited nonlinear characteristic
with a small voltage drop to suggest a low internal resistance of
the electrode.30 Further, increase in the
current density caused a slower discharging of the system. A relatively
fast (thus incomplete) diffusion of electrolyte ions into the pores
of the electrode material at high current densities can be associated
with the abovementioned observation.8 GCD
data were used to calculate the specific capacitance (Cs) of the electrodes according to the mathematical expression
given in eq S2 of the Supporting Information.47 A depiction of the specific capacitance
values as a function of current density is made in Figure 7b, which is indicative of the
fact that a low current density facilitates better specific capacitance.
This property is attributed to the fact that at lower current densities,
electrolyte ions have extra time to access the pores of the active
electrode surface which in turn allows more efficient electronic and
ionic transport.2,6

RAE (a) GCD curves

densities, (c) comparative GCD curves for ZIF-67/rGO and ZIF-67 electrodes,
and (d) capacity retention versus cycle number plot for the ZIF-67/rGO
electrode.

Figure 7c shows
comparative GCD curves for the ZIF-67/rGO and ZIF-67 electrodes using
the optimized RAE at a constant current density of 4.5 A/g. The results
again clearly verified the improved performance of the ZIF-67/rGO
composite electrode as compared to the ZIF-67 electrode. Nonlinear
GCD patterns have been observed because of the occurrence of quasireversible
Faradaic reactions. Because of these Faradaic reactions, the charge/voltage
ratio does not remain constant and varies with time. Therefore, the
values of specific capacitances in the abovementioned systems have
been calculated by integrating the discharging current area (eq S2).47 The values
of specific capacitance with ZIF-67/rGO and ZIF-67 electrodes (at
a current density of 4.5 A g–1) have been estimated
as 1453 and 1014 F g–1, respectively. A higher specific
capacitance by ZIF-67/rGO is explained by the incorporation of rGO
nanosheets which facilitated faster electron transport and more efficient
diffusion of ions into the redox sites of the composite material.

Further, the ZIF-67/rGO electrode has also shown a good long-term
cyclic stability as it retained almost 90% of its capacity after 1000
continuous charge–discharge cycles (Figure 7d). The abovementioned value of cycle stability
suggests an extraordinary performance of the proposed ZIF-67/rGO composite
electrode. The abovementioned feature can be attributed to the combination
of EDLC and Faradaic capacitance achieved by the double layer charging
process. A comparison of the performance of the ZIF-67/rGO electrode
proposed in this study with earlier reported MOF-based supercapacitor
electrodes is given in Table 2, which clearly indicates that the ZIF-67/rGO-redox system
is superior in terms of all three critical performance parameters,
that is, specific capacitance, energy density, and power density.

Amongst the two components of the ZIF-67/rGO composite, ZIF-67
stores charge via pseudocapacitive behavior, whereas rGO accumulates
charge via the EDLC mechanism. Because of this synergy, the use of
the ZIF-67/rGO-redox system has shown promising performance in terms
of specific capacitance and other critical parameters as well. After
assessing the different electrode characteristics, we have assembled
a symmetrical supercapacitor using two equally weighed ZIF-67/rGO
electrodes. About 1 mg cm–2 of the active material
was deposited over each electrode. A filter paper (0.22 μ pore
size) was used as the separator. The two ZIF-67/rGO electrodes were
then sandwiched with the separator paper after soaking all of them
in the redox electrolyte solution. The separator paper prevented the
device from short circuit while allowing transport of ions across
the two electrodes. The device was then tested in a two-electrode
symmetrical cell configuration.

Figure 8 shows the
results of the EIS studies (Nyquist plots) carried out for the ZIF-67/rGO//ZIF-67/rGO-redox
supercapacitor device. The high- and low-frequency regions were analyzed
to estimate the values of Rs and Rct as 22.9 and 8.3 Ω, respectively. A
semicircle shape in the high-frequency region confirmed pseudocapacitive
characteristic of the device, facilitated by the application of RAE.
A low value of Rct (along with a linear
behavior) in the low-frequency region was indicative of the fast charge
transfer mechanism during the charging or discharging of the developed
symmetrical supercapacitor device.49

device (inset shows the equivalent circuit).

The two-electrode symmetrical supercapacitor device, that
is, “ZIF-67/rGO//ZIF-67/rGO”
was first studied for its working potential window. The related CV
curves, recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV/s, for different potential
windows (from 0 to +1.5 V) are shown in Figure 9a. A potential range of 0–1.5 V was
found suitable to obtain maximum current from the device; hence, those
conditions were maintained in all further studies carried out on the
device. CV curves (investigated at different scan rates, e.g., 5–50
mV s–1) followed identical patterns and maintained
their shape (Figure 9b). However, the best current values were achievable with a scan
rate of 5 mV s–1.

potential windows, (b) CV curves at different scan rates, (c) GCD
curves at different current densities, and (d) variation of specific
capacitance as a function of current density.

Figure 9c
shows
the GCD curves for the symmetrical supercapacitor device at various
current densities (3–10 A g–1). A longest
discharging time was found for a current density of 3 A g–1. The device parameters (specific capacitance, energy density, and
power density) have been calculated according to eqs S3–S5″. The maximum specific capacitance
calculated from the GCD curves was 326 F g–1 at
a current density of 3 A g–1, which is an excellent
value for a full symmetrical supercapacitor cell. The variation of
specific capacitance as a function of current density is also shown
in Figure 9d. Here
also better values of specific capacitance were observed at lower
current densities. The estimated values of energy and power densities
at different current densities are indicated in Figure 10a. The Ragone plot has been
used to evaluate the “ZIF-67/rGO//ZIF-67/rGO” symmetrical
supercapacitor for its maximum energy density, which was found to
be 25.5 W h kg–1 (at a power density of 2.7 kW kg–1). This significant high value of energy density reflects
an excellent performance of the proposed device. The favorable material
characteristics of the ZIF-67/rGO electrode along with enhanced redox
behavior from the chosen RAE might be accounted for an enhanced performance
of the present supercapacitor design.

capacity retention of the “ZIF-67/rGO//ZIF-67/rGO”
symmetrical supercapacitor device during successive 1000 charge–discharge
cycles.

The cyclic stability of the symmetrical
supercapacitor device was
also assessed (Figure 10b). The device retained 88.8% of its initial specific capacity after
1000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. Therefore, the ZIF-67/rGO-redox
system could be projected as a practically viable supercapacitor design
with better performance than most of the previously reported MOF-based
supercapacitors.

Two symmetrical supercapacitors were joined
in a series configuration
and then tested to power a white LED (2.5 V, 1.8 mA, 45 mW). The joining
of two symmetrical supercapacitors helped to increase the overall
potential of the device. The white LED remained illuminated for at
least 3 min. This practical demonstration of the supercapacitor’s
efficiency is a vital indicator of potentiality of the ZIF-67/rGO
composite to explore this composite material in future energy storage
devices.

Conclusions
The present research has demonstrated the
application of a ZIF-67/rGO
composite as an efficient supercapacitor electrode material. This
supercapacitor design has been found to work much more efficiently
in the presence of a RAE [0.2 M K3(Fe(CN)6)
+ 1 M Na2SO4] than the simple aqueous electrolyte.
The ZIF-67/rGO composite was prepared from aqueous medium by a simple
stirring-based one-pot method. The resulting ZIF-67/rGO composite
was characterized with a large specific surface area and good electrochemical
performance. The porosity of the material allowed it to behave as
an ion reservoir with short diffusion pathways, thereby enabling rapid
transport of ions. The synergistic enhancements in the composite’s
properties facilitated its application as a supercapacitor electrode
to attain high specific capacitance (∼1453 F g–1 at a current density of 4.5 A g–1) with an excellent
cyclic stability (∼90.5% even after performing 1000 cycles
of charging–discharging). We have also demonstrated the assembly
of a symmetrical supercapacitor device using two ZIF-67/rGO electrodes.
The operation of the symmetrical supercapacitor in the presence of
RAE delivered a high energy density of 25.5 W h kg–1 at a power density of 2.7 kW kg–1. The device
also showed a fair level of cyclic stability (∼88.8%) even
after 1000 charge–discharge cycles. A series of two symmetrical
devices could illuminate a white LED for at least 3 min. To conclude,
it can be outlined that a combination of high surface to volume ratio,
desirable porous properties, and high electrical conductivity make
the ZIF-67/rGO composite as an attractive material to be explored
in high efficiency supercapacitor electrodes. The use of RAE is useful
for further enhancing the electrochemical performance of the MOF-based
supercapacitor electrodes.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All
different chemicals/materials used in
this study were of analytical or high purity grade and used without
any further purification. Graphite powder and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate
(Co(NO3)2·6H2O) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), potassium ferricyanide
(K3[Fe(CN)6]), and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) were purchased from Merck, India. Polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF), 2-methylimidazole, and L-ascorbic acid were
purchased from Himedia, India.

Synthesis of GO and rGO
GO was synthesized using graphite
powder as the starting material (modified Hummers method).38 Briefly, graphite powder was mixed with KMnO4 in a weight ratio of 1:6 (i.e., 1.5 g graphite + 9 g KMnO4). A mixture of H2SO4 (180 mL) and H3PO4 (20 mL) was added to the abovementioned contents
causing an exothermic reaction that raised the temperature of the
reaction mixture to about 35–40 °C. The temperature was
raised further (by heating) to about 50 °C after which the contents
were stirred well for another 2 h. Next, the reaction mixture was
cooled to the RT (25 ± 2 °C) and then placed in an ice bath
before adding 1.5 mL of 30% H2O2. It was followed
by another round of stirring (30 min). Subsequently, the reaction
mixture was centrifuged (8000 rpm, 15 min) to remove impurities such
as amorphous carbon and acid content. For further purification, the
recovered product was washed by centrifugation in the presence of
deionized water, 30% HCl, and ethanol in that order. The above synthesized
and purified GO was dried at 80 °C. The product was manually
crushed to form a fine powder before preserving it at RT conditions.38

For some comparative studies, rGO was
synthesized using ascorbic acid as the reducing agent. Briefly, 1
mg mL–1 aqueous dispersion of GO was mixed with
500 mg of L-ascorbic acid, and the resulting mixture was
left to stir for 1 h maintaining a solution temperature of 95 °C.
After the reaction, the settled black powder was recovered by centrifugation
at 8000 rpm (15 min). The sample was washed multiple times with deionized
water and then left to dry in an oven (80 °C, 12 h).

Synthesis of
ZIF-67/rGO Composite
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate
(450 mg) and GO (45 mg) were dispersed separately in 3 and 20 mL of
deionized water, respectively. The GO sample was sonicated for 2 h
to get a clear dispersion, followed by the addition of 5.5 g of 2-methylimidazole
(linker). The metal ion solution was then added to the mixture of
GO + linker, and the resulting reaction contents were left to stir
for 6 h at RT. After the completion of the reaction, the composite
of ZIF-67/rGO was recovered by centrifugation. The product was washed
with deionized water (twice) and methanol (once) before drying it
under vacuum conditions (80 °C, 12 h).

Material Characterization
and Equipment
XRD patterns
were collected using an X-ray diffractometer ( Bruker, D8 ADVANCE;
scan speed = 4° min–1, Cu Kα radiation
wavelength = 1.54060 Å). Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw
(inVia) system by exciting the sample with a 532 nm laser source.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were carried
out by a FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet iS10; scan rate of 2.5 cm s–1). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area
measurements were performed on a BELSORP-max system from Microtrac.
The ionic conductivity of different concentrations of K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4 has been
evaluated using a portable handheld ionic conductivity meter (model
no. Lovibond sense-direct CON-200). Morphology/microstructural analysis
were investigated with field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM, Hitachi S4300; applied voltage = 5–7 kV) and TEM (Technai
G20; accelerating voltage = 200 KV). The electrochemical measurements
were performed with the PGSTAT 302N instrument (Autolab).

Electrochemical
Testing
Different electrochemical measurements,
including CV, GCD, and EIS, were carried out with a three-electrode system which consisted
of a platinum wire (Pt) as counter, Ag/AgCl as reference, and the
active material over the grafoil substrate as working electrodes.

The working electrode was prepared by mixing the active material
(ZIF-67/rGO composite) with carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) in a w/w ratio of 8:1:1. A slurry of this mixture was formed
in the copresence of N-methyl pyrrolidone. The slurry
was then uniformly coated over a carbon paper (grafoil). Thus, the
obtained electrode paper was left to dry in an oven (80 °C) for
12 h. As determined by the weight analysis, the active mass ratio
of the coated material over the electrode was 2.58 mg cm–2 for redox electrolyte measurements in three-electrode measurements.

The electrochemical studies in three-electrode systems were carried
out exploring two types of electrolytes, namely, 0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4 (RAE) and
1 M Na2SO4 (aqueous electrolyte). CV curves
were collected at various scan rates (100, 50, 20, 10, and 5 mV s–1) over a potential range of −0.1 to 0.5 V.
GCD measurements were also performed at various current densities
(e.g., 8.5, 7, 6, 5.5, and 4.5 A/g) setting the cutoff potential in
the range of −0.1 to 0.5 V (vs the Ag/AgCl reference electrode).
EIS measurements were performed over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to
100 kHz maintaining an alternating current amplitude of 10 mV.
