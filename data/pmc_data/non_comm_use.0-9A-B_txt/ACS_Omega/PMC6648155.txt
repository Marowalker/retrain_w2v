The production of fuel from the hydrodeoxygenation
of vegetable
oils has been extensively investigated on account of the decline of
petroleum-based fuels and increase of ecological problems. The conversion
of jatropha oil over Al-MCM-41-supported Ni, W, and Ni–W catalysts
was studied at 3 MPa and 360 °C. Over the monometallic Ni and
W catalysts, the biofuel yield was low, about 19.3 and 12.5 wt %,
respectively, whereas the highest biofuel yield reached 63.5 wt %
over the Ni–W bimetallic catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and high-resolution TEM results suggested that the proper amount
of Ni and W would form a Ni17W3 active phase,
the particle size of which varied with the content of Ni and W or
preparation methods. The crystalline Ni17W3 phase
formed when the content of both Ni and W reached 10%. With further
increase of the content of W or Ni to 15%, the crystal size of Ni17W3 grew from 7 to 14 nm or to 20 nm, whereas the
biofuel yield decreased with the increase of the Ni17W3 crystal size. The 10Ni–10W/Al-MCM-41 catalyst with
the Ni17W3 crystal size of 7 nm showed the best
performance for the transformation of jatropha oil into high-grade
biofuel.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
exhaustion of traditional petroleum-based fuels and the deterioration
of ecological environment have triggered the development of biomass
conversion technology to obtain alternative products to replace petroleum-based
fuels.1−7 Typical feedstocks for renewable fuels were lipids or fatty acids
originated from different biomass (e.g., jatropha,8−10 microalgae
or rapeseed oil,11,12 waste cooking oils, and fats13,14). Among these, vegetable oil-based feedstocks were potential resources
because of their high energy content and similar structure to traditional
fossil fuels.15 Especially, the hotspot
was concentrated on inedible vegetable oils. Jatropha can be cultivated
mostly in wasteland and produces much more bio-oil than canola, sunflower,
and soyabean.16 Compared with traditional
fuels, jatropha oil exhibited an excellent flash point, solidifying
point, ignition point, and kinematic viscosity.17 But the application of crude jatropha oil was limited due
to its oxygen content which caused some deleterious properties: poor
heating values, high viscosity, instability, and a tendency for polymerization.18

Catalytic deoxygenation (DO) (in the presence
of H2)
has been developed to upgrade vegetable oils using heterogeneous catalysts.19 Currently, the DO reaction includes three distinct
parallel approaches: hydrodeoxygenation (−H2O),
decarbonylation (−CO), and decarboxylation (−CO2), as displayed in Scheme 1.15,20−22 Mainly two
types of catalysts were widely researched to catalytically convert
vegetable oils into hydrocarbons: noble-metal catalysts and transition-metal
sulfides catalysts. Although noble metals (mainly Pd and Pt) were
conducive to DO reactions, the availability of noble metals was limited
for their scarcity and high costs.14 It
has been widely reported that sulfided NiMo, CoMo, and NiW oxides
were effective for DO.23 Zhang and co-workers13 investigated the sulfided CoMo catalysts to
upgrade waste cooking oil, and found that hydrodecarbonylation/decarboxylation
reactions were the major pathways during the removal of oxygen. Toba
and colleagues24 researched the hydrodeoxygenation
performance of sulfided catalysts. They found that sulfided Ni–Mo
and Ni–W catalysts had better hydrodeoxygenation activity than
sulfided Co–Mo catalysts, and low-grade waste oils could be
completely converted into hydrocarbons at 350 °C. Unfortunately,
in these systems, sulfur leaching caused the deactivation of catalysts
and contamination of alkane products.

Scheme 1 Pathways for the
DO of Fatty Acids
Peng and co-workers11 researched
the
catalytic DO of microalgae oil and disclosed that triglycerides were
hydrogenated and the C–O of fatty acid esters was selectively
cleaved due to the function of Ni nanoparticles. Hence, nonexpensive
Ni-based catalysts could be promising alternatives for noble-metal
catalysts. Furthermore, Ni–W bimetallic catalysts have been
recently considered as prospective materials for the DO process. Echeandia
et al.25 conducted phenol hydrodeoxygenation
using Ni–W/active carbon (AC) catalysts, and proposed that
an electronic effect between nickel and tungsten occurred, and Ni–W/AC
showed a good hydrodeoxygenation performance. Subsadsana et al.26 reported the catalytic transformation of palm
oil and concluded that binary NiW-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalysts exhibited
higher activity for the conversion of palm oil into hydrocarbons than
the monometallic catalysts. Wang et al.27 studied Ni(Co)–W–B catalysts for cyclopentanone hydrodeoxygenation.
It was found that WO3 existed in Ni(Co)–W–B
catalysts, which was a great Brønsted acid site, resulting in
low selectivity of oxygenates. Rana and co-workers28 investigated the conversion of waste vegetable oils and
gasoline mixtures into biofuel on the Ni–W catalyst supported
on SiO2–Al2O3. It was proved
that the supported Ni–W catalyst favored decarboxylation and
decarbonylation and gave considerable jet range products. Meanwhile,
it was proposed that mesoporous supports played a crucial role in
the transformation of triglyceride for good diffusion of feedstocks.

Although, some reports concerning the catalytic transformation
of vegetable oils on Ni–W bimetallic catalysts without sulfuration
have been researched, the crystal size effects of nickel and tungsten
active components on the catalytic performance were still not clear.
Besides, the active species with different particle sizes had different
catalytic performances during the reactions of heterogeneous catalysis.29 Thus, in the present work, a series of Ni–W/Al-MCM-41
bimetallic catalysts with various contents of nickel and tungsten
were synthesized. Al-MCM-41 was used as support for its large surface
area and uniform mesopore.30,31 The DO of jatropha
oil over these catalysts was conducted. Catalyst characterizations
were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), N2-physisorption, temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [including high resolution
TEM (HRTEM)], and so forth. Ni17W3 alloy was
found to be the active phase for the conversion of jatropha oil to
biofuel, and the crystal size effect on the biofuel yield is discussed
in detail. This work provides new thoughts about the preparation of
a potential kind of catalyst with versatile functions to convert a
vegetable oil into high-performance biofuel.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Inductively Coupled Plasma
Atomic Emission
Spectroscopy and XRD of All Samples
The actual contents of
Ni and W in all catalysts were detected by the inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES) test (seen in Tables S1 and S2), and it was found that the
actual contents of both Ni and W were somewhat lower than the controlled
ones, whereas those of Ni were closer to the controlled ones compared
to those of W.

All precursors and catalysts were tested by the
XRD technique. The XRD patterns are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. All precursors had a peak at around 23° corresponding to the
amorphous silica in the support.32 As shown
in Figure 1A, when
only 10% Ni was loaded on the Al-MCM-41, the peaks of 37.2°,
43.3°, 62.9°, and 75.3°, corresponding to NiO (PDF
65-6920) were observed. When the W content increased from 2.5 to 15%,
the intensity of NiO diffraction peaks decreased, and when W loading
was less than 10%, only NiO crystallite peaks were observed, whereas
when W loading reached or surpassed 10%, a new diffraction peak at
2θ of 30.8° attributed to NiWO4 (PDF 15-0755)
and peaks at 2θ = 23.7°, 28.5°, and 33.6° attributed
to WO3 (PDF 20-1324) were observed, respectively. The intensity
of NiWO4 and WO3 peaks did not enhance with
further increasing W loading. When loading 10% W solely, WO3 crystallite peaks appeared at 2θ = 23.7°, 28.5°,
33.6°, and 41.5° (PDF 20-1324), as displayed in Figure 1B. When fixing the
W loading at 10%, with the Ni loading increasing from 2.5 to 15%,
the NiO peaks appeared and the intensity increased. When the Ni loading
reached or surpassed 10%, the peak of 2θ = 30.8° attributed
to NiWO4 (PDF 15-0755) was observed.

15). Intensity is given in arbitrary units (a.u.).

For reduced monometallic 10Ni catalyst, the diffraction
peaks at
2θ = 44.4°, 51.7°, and 76.2° were attributed
to the metal nickel (PDF 04-0850), as shown in Figure 2A. Fixing the Ni loading at 10%, when the
mass loading of W increased from 2.5 to 15%, the intensity of the
metal Ni diffraction peaks decreased. When the W loading reached 10%,
the peaks for crystalline WO2 appeared at 25.7°, 36.8°,
and 53.1° (PDF 32-1393) and the peak for W3O appeared
at 39.7° (PDF 41-1230). It could be observed that the diffraction
peaks at about 44°, 51°, and 75° had broad peaks and
relatively poor symmetry. The PDF card showed that Ni17W3 diffraction peaks should appear at 2θ = 43.9°,
51.2°, and 74.9° (PDF 65-4828). Considering the fact that
the diffraction peak of NiWO4 observed on the precursors
vanished, NiWO4 could be transformed to Ni17W3, according to the literature.33,34 It was speculated that Ni17W3 phase might
form, the diffraction peaks of which overlapped with those of Ni.
That is, the diffraction peaks at about 44°, 51°, and 75°
were the overlapped peaks of Ni17W3 and Ni phases.
To further prove the overlapping phenomenon, the following three catalysts
were prepared: (1) 10Ni–10W–Ni catalyst (impregnated
Ni species first), where only the diffraction peak at about 2θ
= 44.4° for Ni phase was observed; (2) 10Ni–10W-700-Redu.
catalyst (increased the reduction temperature to 700 °C), where
only the diffraction peak at about 2θ = 43.9° for Ni17W3 phase was observed; and (3) 10Ni–10W-700-Calc.
catalyst (increased the calcination temperature to 700 °C), where
the overlap of diffraction peaks at about 2θ = 44° for
Ni17W3 and Ni was observed. Comparing the XRD
patterns of these catalysts and enlarging the profile of the diffraction
peak near 2θ = 44° (seen in Figure S1), the individual diffraction peak at 2θ = 43.9°
of Ni17W3 and the individual diffraction peak
at 2θ = 44.4° of Ni were relatively narrow and symmetrical,
whereas the overlapped diffraction peak of Ni17W3 and Ni at about 2θ = 44° became broad and asymmetric.
Besides, when the reduction temperature increased to 700 °C,
there existed the individual diffraction peaks of W at 2θ =
40.4°, 58.4°, and 73.4° (PDF 89-3728) and Ni17W3 without Ni phase. When the calcination temperature
increased to 700 °C, the overlapping phenomenon of Ni17W3 and Ni phases on 10Ni–10W-700-Calc. catalyst
was more obvious than that of the 10Ni–10W catalyst. HRTEM
measurement was carried out to further confirm the existence of Ni17W3 on these catalysts. Lattice fringes on the
catalysts were observed, as shown in Figure S2. The value of lattice distance (d) was about 0.21
nm based on the HRTEM results, and there existed both Ni and W on
these particles based on energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) results (seen
in Figure S3). The standard value of the
Ni17W3 lattice distance was 0.207 nm provided
by the PDF card of MDI Jade 6.0 software, thus, it further proved
the formation of Ni17W3 alloy phase, and Ni17W3 alloy phase mainly exposed the crystal face
of (111). Thus, the peak-fitting of these peaks was conducted based
on the PDF 65-4828 card provided by MDI Jade 6.0 software; then, according
to Scherrer’s formula, their particle sizes were separately
calculated. Furthermore, all of these peaks strengthened with the
increase of W loading. The WO3 diffraction peaks at 23.5°,
33.1°, and 40.4° (PDF 32-1395) and those for WO2 at 25.7°, 36.8°, and 53.1° (PDF 32-1393) were observed
on pure 10W catalyst in Figure 2B. Fixing the loading of W at 10%, when the loading of Ni
was 2.5 and 5%, the crystalline W3O peaks appeared at 35.4°,
39.7°, and 43.7° (PDF 41-1230) and the diffraction peaks
of WO3 disappeared. When the loading of Ni reached or surpassed
10%, the diffraction peaks of Ni17W3 appeared
and the intensity enhanced with increasing Ni loading. At the same
time, the intensity of Ni peaks enhanced with increasing the content
of nickel as well. The crystal sizes of different species were calculated
by the Scherrer equation and are listed in Table 1. For 10Ni–yW catalysts
(y = 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5, 15), the Ni crystal size
on 10Ni catalyst was 15 nm and its crystal size slightly decreased
with adding W species. When the W content reached 10%, the crystal
size of Ni17W3 was about 7 nm, and grew up to
14 nm with continuously increasing the content of W to 15%. Besides,
for 10W–xNi catalysts (x =
0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5, 15), the crystal Ni17W3 phases were also observed when the addition of Ni species was equal
to 10%. Although with consistently increasing the content of Ni from
10 to 15%, the crystal size of the Ni17W3 phase
increased from 7 to 20 nm. For Ni–W bimetallic catalysts, when
the W content was equal to or more than 10%, W3O and WO2 species could be observed. The crystalline size of W3O varied little with varying W content and that of WO2 varied from 17 to 29 nm. Although the deconvolution might
not be very accurate, the variation trend of the particle sizes would
provide some valuable information about the size of particles.

2.2 XPS Results
XPS measurements were
conducted to analyze the chemical states of Ni and W. For 10Ni–yW catalysts (y = 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5,
15) as shown in Figure 3A, the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 near 852.3 and 855.5
eV was attributed to Ni0 and Ni2+, separately.35 With increasing W loading from 2.5 to 15%, the
Ni 2p3/2 binding energy moved from 852.3 to 852.8 eV. The
increase of Ni 2p3/2 binding energy was caused by the electron
transformation from Ni to W in Ni17W3 alloy
as observed in XRD. The electronegativity of tungsten was stronger
than nickel, causing charge transfer from Ni to W.34,36−38 The peak located at 861.4 eV was attributed to a
satellite peak of Ni 2p3/2 due to multielectron excitation.25 Accordingly, the binding energy of W 4f doublets
at 35.6 and 37.7 eV decreased to 34.8 and 37.0 eV when the W loading
increased from 2.5 to 15% in Figure 3B. The W 4f doublets with binding energy near 35.6
and 37.7 eV were corresponded to W6+ 4f7/2 and
W6+ 4f5/2 species in WO3 or NiWO4.39

2p and (B) XPS spectra of W 4f for 10Ni–yW
catalysts (y = 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5,

As described in Figure 4A, the binding energy of Ni
2p3/2 of 10W–xNi catalysts (x = 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5,
15) also increased from 852.3 to 853.7 eV, which resembled the 10Ni–yW catalysts (y = 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5,
15). For the results of 10W–xNi catalysts
(x = 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5, 15) in Figure 4B, there also existed similar
decrease of the W 4f binging energy to that in Figure 3B. The above results confirmed the formation
of Ni17W3 alloy on these catalysts.

2.3 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
Results
As depicted in Figure 5A,B, the isotherms with a hysteresis loop were identified
as a type IV characteristic of mesoporous materials. It was disclosed
that the support and all catalysts belonged to mesoporous materials.40 According to the pore size distributions from Figure 6A,B, it was found
that the pore size of support was mostly in a range of 2 and 30 nm,
which also indicated the presence of mesopores in the material. Ni–W
bimetallic catalysts distributed mainly in 2–20 nm compared
with the support. Besides, fixing 10% Ni or 10% W, the pores of 2–30
nm obviously decreased with increasing the other metal content from
2.5 to 15%. Thus, the results proved that some Ni and W species entered
into these pores, whereas others supported on the surface of the carrier
without blocking the 2–30 nm mesopores.

0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5, 15).

Tables 2 and 3 demonstrated the physicochemical properties of
all catalysts. As observed from Tables 2 and 3, the surface area and
pore volume of Al-MCM-41 were 808 m2·g–1 and 1.16 cm3·g–1, respectively.
The surface areas of 10Ni and 10W catalysts were 522 and 708 m2·g–1, respectively. When the W loading
increased from 2.5 to 15%, the surface areas of binary Ni–W
catalysts were slightly larger than the 10Ni catalyst because of the
interaction of active components or the smaller active Ni–W
particles.41 With the Ni content increasing
from 2.5 to 15%, the surface area of binary Ni–W catalysts
decreased compared with the 10W catalyst. As a whole, fixing 10% Ni
or 10% W, with increasing the other metal content from 2.5 to 15%,
the surface areas and pore volumes of Ni–W bimetallic catalysts
declined comparing to the carrier as expected, disclosing that the
active components were indeed loaded on the surface and channels of
the support.

2.4 TPR Results
TPR graphs of all precursors
were obtained to decide the reduction temperature of nickel and tungsten
species. As displayed in Figure 7A, for 10Ni precursor, the α1 reduction
peak centered at about 368 °C was caused by the reduction of
bulk NiO.32 The α2 reduction
peak appeared at higher temperature (about 483 °C), and the shoulder
was attributed to highly dispersed NiO interacting strongly with the
support.35,42 On the 10W precursor in Figure 7B, the β1 peak
at about 500 °C resulted from WO3 interacting weakly
with the carrier, whereas the intense β2 and β3 peaks at around 623 °C and at 735 °C were caused
by WO3 and WO2 reduction, respectively.25,39 Fixing the loading of Ni at 10% in Figure 7A, with loading W species, the α1 reduction peak shifted toward higher temperature (370–390
°C), implying that W species enhanced the interaction between
NiO with the support. Additionally, with increasing the loading of
tungsten, the intensity of the α1 reduction peak
weakened, and the α2 reduction peak became broader
and shifted toward higher temperature. Combined with XRD, the results
demonstrated that the broad peaks in the range of 528–590 °C
were caused by coreduction of NiO and WO3 or NiWO4.33,43−46 When the W loading reached 10%
or above, the fitted peak at 535–550 °C was attributed
to the reduction peak of NiWO4,20,39,40 which led to the formation of the Ni17W3 alloy.

TPR curves of 10W–xNi precursors (x = 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5,
15).

When the W loading was fixed at
10% as depicted in Figure 7B, the NiO reduction peak (366–443
°C) appeared and its intensity increased with increasing nickel
contents. When the nickel loading reached 10% or above, the β1 peak disappeared and the β2 peak became
broader and shifted toward a lower-temperature range (513–618
°C). Similarly, the fitted peak at 513–550 °C resulted
from the NiWO4 reduction peak. Additionally, the reduction
peak in the range of 698–772 °C resulted from the reduction
of WO2. In comparison with monometallic precursors, the
reduction temperature of Ni increased and that of W species decreased
on Ni–W bimetallic precursors. It was suggested that there
existed interaction between Ni and W on Ni–W bimetallic precursors.

2.5 TEM Results
Representative TEM images
of the catalysts showed metal particles with different shapes, and
the particle size distributions were also determined by TEM pictures.
As displayed in Figure 8, the nearly spherical particles of metal Ni species slightly formed
agglomerates on the 10Ni catalyst. With the addition of metal W, the
particles gradually dispersed well and there existed both spherical
and elliptical particles on the Ni–W bimetallic catalysts.
Besides, the particle sizes on 10Ni–2.5W and 10Ni–5W
catalysts mainly distributed between 14–18 and 13–16
nm, respectively. When the loading of W increased to 10 and 15%, the particle size distributions over
10Ni–10W, 10Ni–12.5W, and 10Ni–15W catalysts
changed from 9–12 to 17–20 nm (Table 4).

Similarly, some groups of dark-thread-like floccules could be observed
on the 10W catalyst in Figure 9. With the increase of Ni content, the spherically shaped
metallic particles could be clearly seen and had a better dispersion
degree than the 10W catalyst. As a whole, the particles of Ni–W
bimetallic catalysts had a better dispersion than the monometallic
ones, and both spherical and elliptical particles were observed. Besides,
10W–2.5Ni and 10W–5Ni catalysts had broad distributions
between 16–20 and 16–19 nm, respectively. But when the
content of nickel increased, the particle size distributions changed
from 9–12 to 18–27 nm over 10Ni–10W, 10W–12.5Ni,
and 10W–15Ni catalysts, seen in Table 4. Hence, it was indicated that adjusting
Ni and W loadings to an optimum value could obtain small particles
with better dispersion. The particle size distributions by TEM were
a little bit bigger than those based on XRD results.

2.6 Catalytic
Activity Evaluation
Tungsten-based
catalysts were considered as promising hydrocracking catalysts with
the DO performance.20,47,48 It was found that the jatropha oil could be completely converted
into hydrocarbons, and no linoleic acid (C18:2), palmitic
acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and oleic
acid (C18:1) were seen in the products, as shown in Figure S4. Shown in Table 5, the low bio-oil yield of 19.3 wt % was
obtained on 10Ni catalyst, and the main liquid products were composed
of C6–C18 straight-chain alkanes, the detailed composition
of which is given in Table S3. When fixing
the Ni loading at 10%, with increasing W content from 2.5 to 10%,
the yield of bio-oil increased from 11.7 to 63.5 wt %. Yet, with the
loading of W continuously going up to 15%, the bio-oil yield decreased
to 28.7 wt %. The major liquid products were also composed of C6–C18
straight-chain paraffins, a few i-paraffins, aromatics, and naphthenes
on Ni–W bimetallic catalysts, as shown in Table S3. Combined with XRD results, it was observed that
there was no Ni17W3 phase on the 10Ni, 10Ni–2.5W,
and 10Ni–5W catalysts, and the bio-oil yields were low. When
the Ni17W3 phase was observed when the W loading
reached 10%, the bio-oil yield was the highest and the contents of
i-paraffins and aromatics were the lowest. With the W content going
up from 10 to 15%, the Ni17W3 crystal size grew
up from 7 to 14 nm, the bio-oil yield decreased, and the contents
of i-paraffins and aromatics increased.

Nickel catalysts were well-known for their hydrogenation performance
and had a good selectivity for oxygen removal under mild hydrodeoxygenation
conditions.49−53 The jatropha oil was completely transformed into alkanes with no
residual linoleic acid (C18:2), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and oleic acid (C18:1), as seen in Figure S5. For 10W catalyst,
the C6–C18 straight-chain alkanes were the main liquid products
as seen in Table S4. Besides, fixing the
W loading at 10%, when Ni loading was 2.5%, seen in Table 5, the bio-oil yield exhibited
a slight decrease compared with the 10W catalyst. When the Ni loading
changed from 2.5 to 10%, the yield of bio-oil increased from 11.9
to 63.5 wt %. However, when Ni content increased from 10 to 15%, the
yield of bio-oil declined to 31.9 wt %. Except a minor amount of i-paraffins,
aromatics, and naphthenes on Ni–W bimetallic catalysts, the
major liquid products were composed of C6–C18 alkanes, as shown
in Table S4. Hexadecanoic acid (C16) and
octadecanoic acid (C18) might be transformed to C15–C18 alkanes
by hydrodeoxygenation, decarbonylation, or decarboxylation reaction,
then the formed long alkanes would be further cracked into short alkanes
(C6–C14), ascribing to the existence of acidic sites in the
catalysts (seen in Figures S6 and S7 and Table S5).54 i-Paraffins
and aromatics were obtained by isomerization and aromatization reactions.
Combined with XRD results, when there existed no Ni17W3 alloy, the bio-oil yields were not high. When the content
of Ni was equal to 10%, the bio-oil yield enhanced and the amounts
of i-paraffins and aromatics declined with the Ni17W3 alloy formed. When the nickel loading went up continuously
from 10 to 15%, the Ni17W3 alloy crystal size
became bigger from 7 to 20 nm, while the bio-oil yield decreased from
the highest (63.5 wt %) to 31.9 wt %, and i-paraffins and aromatics
increased. It implied that when there existed only Ni, W3O, WO2 phases, the bio-oil yields were not high. With
the formation of the Ni17W3 alloy phase, the
bio-oil yield increased greatly. Besides, the crystal sizes of Ni,
W3O, and WO2 phases varied little and that of
the Ni17W3 alloy phase increased with increasing
Ni or W from 10 to 15%, while the bio-oil yield decreased. Therefore,
Ni, W3O, and WO2 phases might not be the main
active phases and the crystal sizes slightly affected the bio-oil
yield. The Ni17W3 alloy phase was the main active
phase, and the increase of its crystal size caused the decrease of
bio-oil yield. Ni17W3 might prevent the formation
of i-paraffins and aromatics, and the inhibition of isomerization
and aromatization reactions decreased with the increase of Ni17W3 particle size.

To further verify the
role of Ni17W3, the
10Ni–10W–Ni catalyst (first impregnating Ni, calcination,
then impregnating W), 10Ni–10W–W catalyst (first impregnating
W, calcination, then impregnating Ni), and the solid mixture of 10Ni
and 10W as catalyst (which was mechanically mixed by 3 g total mass
of 10Ni and 10W catalysts at the ratio of 1:1 to make the total contents
of Ni and W the same as 10Ni–10W) were prepared and the activity
experiments under the same conditions were conducted. There were no
Ni17W3 diffraction peaks on the above catalysts
as seen in Figure S8, consequently, the
bio-oil yields were very low compared with 10Ni–10W as shown
in Table S6. Therefore, the best activity
of 10Ni–10W might really come from the presence of Ni17W3 alloy in this system.

The preparation methods
of the catalyst, such as calcination temperature
(increased to 700 °C), reduction temperature (increased to 700
°C), the loading amount of Ni and W (increased the loading of
Ni and W, they were both 20%, respectively), the impregnation procedure
of the components (impregnated Ni or W species first), and the rate
of reduction and reduction time (at a fast or slow rate of reduction
temperature) were varied, and the catalytic performances of the samples
were tested under the same conditions. The results were as follows:
(1) when increasing the loading amount of both Ni and W to 20%, the
particle size of Ni17W3 increased and the bio-oil
yield decreased. (2) When increasing the reduction temperature to
700 °C, the active phases of the catalyst changed. The diffraction
peaks of pure Ni17W3 were observed at 2θ
= 43.9°, 51.2°, and 74.9° (PDF 65-4828), and the diffraction
peaks of W were observed at 2θ = 40.4°, 58.4°, and
73.4° (PDF 89-3728), and the particle size of Ni17W3 grew up to 10 nm, and consequently, the bio-oil yield
was low. (3) When increasing the calcination temperature to 700 °C,
the overlapped peaks of Ni17W3 and Ni were more
obvious than before, and the particle size of Ni17W3 grew up to 13 nm, while the bio-oil yield was 16.9 wt %.
(4) When changing the impregnation order of Ni and W, no matter which
order was followed for first impregnating Ni or W, the main diffraction
peak at about 2θ = 44° was only Ni phase. There were no
Ni17W3 phases observed and the bio-oil yields
were also low. (5) When increasing or decreasing the rate of reduction
temperature, the particle size of Ni17W3 could
increase to 11 or 12 nm and the bio-oil yields were not high. Based
on the above XRD results as seen in Figure S9, the amount of Ni17W3 phase actually increased,
accompanied by the particle size of Ni17W3 increasing
by varying the preparation methods of the catalysts, but the bio-oil
yields all decreased, as shown in Table S7. These results also supported the previous discussion, that is,
the Ni17W3 alloy was the main active phase and
the small particle size of Ni17W3 made a big
contribution to the high bio-oil yield.

The thermogravimetry
(TG)–MS experiment for the best catalyst
10Ni–10W was carried out after the first run. The weight loss
rate of the used catalyst was 33%, and there were two weight loss
peaks at the temperature of about 350 and 500 °C (seen in Figure S10). The TG results suggested that carbon
deposition was serious. The best catalyst 10Ni–10W was picked
out to study the reuse. The catalyst was regenerated by calcination
and reduction, and then, the catalytic activity was tested under the
same conditions. In the second run, the bio-oil yield was 46.0 wt
% and the obtained bio-oil was clear, and in the third run, the bio-oil
yield was 39.0 wt % and the obtained bio-oil was still clear. The
components of the bio-oil were both C6–C18 straight-chain alkanes
on the regenerated catalysts (seen in Figure S11). After three runs, the active phases of the best catalyst had no
obvious change, as seen in Figure S12,
whereas the particle size grew a little bigger than the fresh catalyst
and the bio-oil yield decreased, as shown in Table S8. It was further proved that the small particle size of Ni17W3 favored the increase of bio-oil yield. How
to keep the stability of this catalytic system needs further study.

3 Conclusions
In this article, Ni–W
bimetallic catalysts realizing complete
transformation of jatropha oil was discussed. Compared with monometallic
catalysts, the 10Ni–10W/Al-MCM-41 bimetallic catalyst exhibited
excellent catalytic performance with 63.5 wt % bio-oil yield. The
high catalytic activity of the 10Ni–10W catalyst was due to
the existence of small particles of Ni17W3 alloy
(about 7 nm). Excessive Ni or W loading would increase Ni17W3 alloy particle size and decrease the bio-oil yield.
The Ni–W bimetallic catalyst is a promising hydrodeoxygenation
catalyst for biofuel production, and small crystal size of Ni17W3 for high bio-oil yield and desired products
could be obtained by adjusting the loading of Ni and W.

4 Experiments
4.1 Synthesis of Support
The MCM-41 support
was synthesized by the hydrothermal method.55 Appropriate amounts of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and
sodium hydroxide were added to 200 mL of deionized water, and the
mixed solution was stirred until these components were fully dissolved
at room temperature. Ethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added carefully,
then the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 5.5 by addition
of dilute nitric acid, and stirring for 3 h. The synthesis gel was
formed at room temperature and then filtered, water-washed until neutral,
dried for 3 h at 110 °C, and subsequently calcined at 540 °C
for 8 h.

According to the above procedures, by adding aluminum
nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O) to the
mixed solution after the addition of TEOS, Al-modified MCM-41 could
be obtained.

4.2 Synthesis of the Catalysts
All samples
were synthesized by the conventional impregnation method and TPR.
In brief, a proper amount of a mixed solution of ammonia metatungstate
and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) was used for impregnation. The catalyst precursors were
obtained by drying at 110 °C, and the impregnated supports were
calcined at 600 °C. First, the precursors were reduced under
a flow of H2, heated to 400 °C at a fast rate, then
the temperature was raised to 600 °C at 2 °C·min–1 and maintained for 2 h. Subsequently, the catalysts
were cooled down in a N2 flow overnight. The obtained catalysts
were designated as xNi, yW, or xNi–yW, in which “x” and “y” represented
the controlled content of nickel and tungsten, separately. Control
samples were also prepared by varying the preparation conditions.

4.3 Catalyst Characterizations
Atomic
absorption spectroscopy was obtained by a VG PQ ExCell to test the
actual contents of Ni and W. Before the test, all catalysts were dissolved
by a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid (48%), nitric acid, ammonia
(25–28%), hydrogen peroxide (27%), and citric acid.

XRD
was conducted on a Shimadzu XRD-6100 diffractometer by using Cu Kα
radiation. The XRD pattern was gained in the diffraction angle range
of 5°–80°.

XPS spectra were taken by an AXIS
Ultra DLD (Kratos) spectrometer
using monochromatic Al Kα radiation at 80 eV pass energy. The
contaminant carbon (C 1s = 284.6 eV) as an internal standard calibrated
the binding energy of the samples.

N2 adsorption
and desorption isotherms at 77 K were
measured using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 analyzer. The surface
area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
equation, whereas the pore volume and average pore diameter were decided
by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method using the desorption
branches of the isotherms.

TPR in H2 was tested on
a Micromeritics AutoChem II
2920 instrument. The TPR program was carried out under a mixed flow
of H2/Ar at 5 °C·min–1 heating
rate to 900 °C, and then kept for 1 h.

An FEI Tecnai G2
20 TWIN instrument (operation voltage 200 kV)
with EDX spectrometer obtained TEM images and HRTEM images.

Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) in NH3 was measured
on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. The TPD program was
conducted under a mixed flow of 10% NH3/He at 150 °C,
and then kept for 4 h.

4.4 Catalytic Performance Evaluation
Using a fixed-bed reactor, the DO of jatropha oil was conducted.56 Typically, 3 g of catalyst sample (40–60
mesh) was loaded and mixed uniformly by small porcelain balls in the
reactor to improve heat transfer. The experiments were conducted at
360 °C and overall pressure of 3 MPa in a mixed flow of H2 and N2. Jatropha oil was continuously added to
the reactor with a liquid micro pump for 5 h. The liquid yield (yield)
could be calculated based on the following equation  where Wproduct and W were the mass
of total oil products and added
jatropha oil during the reaction, respectively. In addition, the repeated
activity experiments were carried out, and the standard deviations
are listed in Table S9.

4.5 Raw Material and Product Analysis
Gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS, Agilent
5973) equipped with a capillary column (HP-INNOWax, 30 m × 0.25
mm × 0.25 μm) detected the liquid products and jatropha
oil. The temperatures of injector and detector were both 553 K. The
temperature program for the GC oven was set as follows: 343 K (4 min),
5 K min–1, 373 K (6 min), 10 K min–1, 433 K, 10 K min–1, 503 K (6 min). The jatropha
oil contained linoleic acid (C18:2), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and oleic acid (C18:1) revealed by GC–MS analysis, as shown in Figure S13, and the peak area contents were about
14.97, 9.50, 5.13, and 19.82% respectively. According to Hua et al.,57 the composition of jatropha oil from Panzhihua
in Southeast China was mainly 40.31 wt % oleic acid (C18:1), 32.69 wt % linoleic acid (C18:2), 17.25 wt % palmitic
acid (C16:0), and 7.42 wt % stearic acid (C18:0). Then, the liquid products were quantitatively analyzed by a gas
chromatograph (PerkinElmer Clarus 680) equipped with an Elite-Petro
column (100 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 μm). The injector and
detector temperatures were both set at 553 K. The temperature program
for the GC oven was set as follows: 308 K (10 min), 5 K min–1, 323 K (55 min), 1.3 K min–1, 473 K.
