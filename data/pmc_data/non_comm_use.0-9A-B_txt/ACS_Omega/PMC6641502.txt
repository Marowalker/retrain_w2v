We
have studied the effects of dispersion interactions on the dynamics
of vibrational frequency fluctuations, hydrogen bonds, and free OD
modes in supercritical heavy water at three different densities by
means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The vibrational
spectral diffusion, as described by the frequency fluctuations, is
studied through calculations of frequency time correlation of stretch
modes of deuterated water, and its relations to the dynamics of hydrogen
bonds and free OD modes are described. In addition, some of the other
dynamical, structural, and electronic properties such as diffusion,
rotational relaxation, radial distribution functions, hydrogen bond
and coordination numbers, and dipole moments are also investigated
from the perspectives of their variation with inclusion of dispersion
interactions at varying density of the solvent. Although some changes
in the structural properties are found on inclusion of dispersion
corrections, no significant difference in the fluctuation dynamics
of OD stretching frequencies and also in other dynamical quantities
of supercritical water are found because of dispersion effects. The
dynamics of water molecules under supercritical conditions is very
fast compared to the corresponding dynamics under ambient conditions.
The large thermal effects at such a high temperature seem to take
over any relatively minor changes that might be introduced by weak
dispersion interaction.

1 Introduction
Information about the
hydrogen bond dynamics of water molecules
can be obtained experimentally by studying the vibrational spectral
diffusion of stretch modes of water through time-dependent infrared
spectroscopy.1−16 In the liquid state, water molecules are in continuous motion that
leads to the breaking and formation of hydrogen bonds, and this process
also affects the vibrational frequencies of water. Various research
groups have performed studies to investigate how these two phenomena
are related to each other.1−22 It is known that water molecules form three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded
network in the liquid phase. In aqueous solutions, apart from water–water
hydrogen bonds, water molecules also form hydrogen bonds with many
other charged or polar molecules, and this hydrogen-bonded network
can be perturbed by increasing the temperature of the solutions.

Water under supercritical conditions is of great importance because
it behaves like a fluid of different characteristics at such high
temperatures. The nature of supercritical water changes from liquidlike
to a gaslike fluid on decrease of density without any phase transition.
The electronic property of water changes as also the dipole moment
and polarizability of water molecules when one moves from ambient
to the supercritical states. The dynamical properties like hydrogen
bond dynamics, rotational motion, diffusional motion of water molecules,
and also the vibrational frequency fluctuations in supercritical water
can be very different from those of the ambient water. To understand
these dynamical properties, especially the dynamics of vibrational
spectral diffusion and its relations with other relevant dynamical
modes, one needs to look at the molecular dynamics of water at the
supercritical state. The first experimental study of time-dependent
infrared spectroscopy of supercritical water was done about a decade
ago.23,24 In that study, it was inferred that vibrational
spectral diffusion in supercritical water, if any, would take place
rather fast with a timescale of less than 300 fs. Theoretical studies
of the hydrogen bond structure and dynamics in supercritical water
were first carried out using molecular dynamics simulations with empirical
potential models of water.22,25−28 Subsequently, the connection of hydrogen bond dynamics with vibrational
spectral diffusion was also investigated through ab initio simulations
without involving any empirical potential models.29 There have also been other first principles simulation
studies of water which looked into various structural and dynamical
behavior of supercritical water.30,31 However, all
these studies were performed within density functional theory for
the electronic structure calculations using the well-known BLYP functional32,33 without any long-range dispersion corrections. It may be noted that
BLYP and other functionals belonging to the same generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) category do not properly include the dispersion
interactions, especially at long distances. In recent years, there
have been a number of theoretical studies which have shown that inclusion
of dispersion corrections34,35 into BLYP or other
GGA functionals provide better phase diagram, structure, and dynamics
of water.36−40 In view of these results, very recently, some work has also been
carried out to look at the effects of dispersion interactions on the
hydrogen bond dynamics and vibrational spectral diffusion of liquid
water.41−43 However, to the best of our knowledge, no theoretical
study has yet been carried out on how the dispersion interactions
affect the vibrational spectral diffusion and its correlations with
various dynamical properties of water under supercritical conditions
and also their dependence on the density of supercritical water. Here,
we have performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of supercritical
water to address these issues by using a dispersion corrected density
functional.

In the present work, we have carried out ab initio
molecular dynamics
simulations of supercritical water by using the BLYP32,33 functional with dispersion corrections,34,35 which is referred to as the BLYP-D functional. Three different densities
of supercritical water have been considered in the current study.
The vibrational spectral diffusion has been investigated by calculating
the frequency time correlation functions from the simulation trajectories.
The calculation of the stretching frequencies is done by using the
method of wavelet analysis while the hydrogen bond dynamics and rotational
relaxation of water molecules are looked at by calculating appropriate
time correlation functions. The BLYP-D functional is found to produce
a higher peak in the O–O radial distribution function than
the corresponding BLYP result at the supercritical state, and our
results are found to be in good agreement with the results of an earlier
study.37 However, we have not observed
any significant changes in the dynamics of spectral diffusion of water
because the molecular dynamics of water molecules is very fast at
this higher temperature compared to that of ambient water. It is found
that the decay of vibrational spectral diffusion has primarily two
timescales. At the higher density (1.1 g cm–3),
there is a short timescale corresponding to the dynamics of free OD
bonds and first inertial motion of OD bonds which is followed by a
slower timescale corresponding to the hydrogen bond lifetime. At lower
density, an opposite scenario is found where the longer-time component
is found to correspond to the timescales of free OD modes. With inclusion
of dispersion corrections, it is found that the longer timescale of
vibrational spectral diffusion decreases from ∼0.2 to ∼0.1
ps at 1.1 g cm–3 and from ∼0.54 to ∼0.50
ps at 0.39 g cm–3. In addition to the dynamics of
spectral diffusion, we have also looked at the average frequency–structure
correlations for the higher and lower densities of supercritical water
by using the BLYP-D functional.

We have organized the rest of
the paper as follows. The effects
of dispersion interactions on structural properties and also the relationship
between the OD stretching frequency and the D···O distance
are presented in section 2. The results of vibrational spectral diffusion of OD modes
are discussed in section 3. The relations between the hydrogen bonds, free OD bond dynamics,
and the vibrational spectral diffusion are discussed in section 4. The results of rotational
correlation functions and translational diffusion are presented in section 5. The results of
dipole moment calculations are discussed in section 6, and our conclusions are briefly summarized
in section 7. We have
the computational details of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
and frequency calculations in section 8.

2 Effects of Dispersion Interactions
on the Structure,
Hydrogen Bonds, and Frequency–Structure Correlations
In Figures 1 and 2, we have shown the structural features of supercritical
water for the BLYP-D functional, and the results have also been compared
with those of the BLYP functional. The oxygen–oxygen radial
distribution function is found to be more structured for the BLYP-D
functional compared to that produced by the BLYP functional. Also,
the BLYP-D results are found to be in better agreement with experimental
results.44 Our results are also in good
agreement with the earlier results of Vuilleumier and co-workers.37 It is found that the effects of dispersion interactions
on radial distribution functions (O···D and O···O)
become more pronounced as the density is decreased. We have calculated
the hydrogen bond (HB) numbers for both functionals at the three densities.
The presence of a hydrogen bond is determined by using a set of configurational
criteria. If the O···D distance is less than the distance
of first minimum of the intermolecular O···D radial
distribution function and the O···O distance is less
than the first minimum of the intermolecular O···O
radial distribution functions, then a hydrogen bond exists between
the two water molecules. The HB numbers are found to be 2.76 (2.89),
1.73 (1.90), and 1.25 (1.46) at densities of 1.1, 0.78, and 0.39 g
cm–3 for the BLYP (BLYP-D) functional. The same
for the bigger system of higher density is 2.8 (2.9) for BLYP (BLYP-D)
functional.

respectively. *The experimental results44 at the density of 0.75 g cm–3 are also shown in
both the figures.

It is important to see
how the frequency–structure correlation
varies with the inclusion of dispersion interaction and also with
the thermodynamic conditions. The contour plots of the conditional
probability of finding a particular frequency for a given D···O
distance are shown in Figure 3. The contour plots are found to be more elongated along the X-axis with decreasing densities under supercritical conditions.
In all cases, substantial dispersions are found in the probability
distributions which means no single instantaneous frequency could
be assigned to a given D···O distance. However, the
average frequency is seen to increase with increase of the D···O
distance. The rate of increase is also seen to gradually decrease
as the density is decreased. Also, the position of the maximum probability
moves to a larger distance–higher frequency value with decrease
of density, which can be linked to the weaker and less number of hydrogen
bonds at the elevated temperature. The extent of correlation between
the structure and OD frequency can be quantified in terms of the correlation
coefficient between the OD frequency and the D···O
distance. The correlation coefficient can be defined in the following
way 1  where x is the D···O
distance denoted by R. Clearly, χR = 1.0 for a perfect
linear correlation, while a zero value of the correlation coefficient
χR means there is no statistical correlation between
the OD frequency and the D···O distance. The values
of χR are given in Table 1 for all the systems studied here. The values
of χR for supercritical water are found to be smaller
than that for ambient water. Clearly, for supercritical water, the
correlation between the stretch frequency and the hydrogen bond distance
is far from perfect. However, the correlation coefficient is still
far above zero, which means that a statistical correlation between
the stretch frequency and the nearest D···O distance
continues to exist to some extent even at supercritical states, especially
when the density is not too low.

functional.

3 Dynamics of Vibrational Spectral Diffusion
The dynamics
of vibrational spectral diffusion of OD bonds is investigated
by calculating the frequency–frequency time correlation function
which is defined as 2  where δω(t) is
the fluctuation from the average frequency at time t. The results of Cω(t) are shown in Figure 4. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the frequency correlations generally show a biphasic
decay with a very fast decay within 100 fs and then a relatively slower
decay extending over a longer time. The slower decay is seen to extend
beyond 0.5 ps for the lower density of 0.39 g cm–3. To quantify the timescales of this biphasic decay, we have used
a biexponential fitting of the calculated frequency–frequency
time correlation function by the following function29 3  

Figure 4 Time correlation functions
of OD fluctuating frequencies of supercritical
water for the density of 1.1, 0.78, and 0.39 g cm–3, respectively, for the BLYP-D functional. Results are also included
for the density of 1.1 g cm–3 under ambient conditions.
The different curves are as shown in the figure. The light gray curves
show the biexponential fits.

The biexponential fits (eq 3) to the simulation results are also shown in this
figure.
The corresponding timescales are included in Table 2. We first discuss the values of the shorter
relaxation time (τ1). For the same system size of N = 32, τ1 is found to decrease from 0.10
to about 0.06 ps, whereas τ2 is found to increase
from 0.13 to 0.50 ps when the density is decreased from 1.1 to 0.39
g cm–3. For the larger system of N = 64, the values of τ1 and τ2 are
0.07 and 0.16 ps, respectively. All these quoted values are for the
BLYP-D functional although the BLYP values are not too different.
The error bars of these timescales, which were calculated by dividing
the total trajectory of a given system into blocks of 7.5 ps, were
found to be less than 8% for the smaller systems of N = 32 and about 3% for the larger system of N =
64. As expected, the timescales are found to be better converged for
the larger system. Combining both the density and system size effects,
the slowing down of the second relaxation time (τ2) is found to be more significant than the acceleration of the short-time
dynamics (τ1) with decrease of density. It is, however,
noted that the weight of the short-time dynamics is significantly
higher than that of the longer-time relaxation characterized by τ2. For τ1, the effect of density decrease
is found to be almost as much as the system size effect, and thus,
no definite conclusion could be drawn regarding the variation of this
timescale. This variation is found to be as much as the scattering
of its calculated values. Regarding the effect of the dispersion corrections,
it is seen that the dispersion corrections make the dynamics significantly
faster for ambient water, which was also found in earlier studies.37,39−43 However, for supercritical water, the corresponding change in the
dynamics due to dispersion corrections is found to be much less significant.
We also note that each OD mode has been treated as a local oscillator
for calculations of vibrational frequencies. Because the effects of
vibrational population relaxation and Forster energy transfer through
resonant excitonic couplings are not incorporated in our current calculations,
the present work can be better considered as an approximation of the
spectral diffusion of isotopically diluted water. In this context,
we note the recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulation study45 of vibrational spectral diffusion in liquid
water including van der Waals corrections where the intermolecular
energy transfer and the delocalization of the O–H stretch mode
were shown to be particularly important for the vibrational spectral
diffusion in neat liquid water.

To have a better understanding about the dynamical
origin of the
vibrational spectral diffusion timescales, we have calculated the
hydrogen bond dynamics and also the survival dynamics of free OD bonds.
The rotational dynamics of OD modes are also calculated, and the results
of these calculations are discussed in the next two sections.

4 Dynamics of Hydrogen Bonds and Free OD Modes
The calculation
of hydrogen bond dynamics is done by using the
so-called population correlation function approach.46−51 In particular, we have calculated the continuous hydrogen bond correlation
function, SHB(t), which
gives the probability that a pair of water molecules, which was hydrogen-bonded
at time t = 0, remains hydrogen-bonded continuously
up to time t. The integral of SHB(t) provides the average lifetime of a hydrogen
bond. We have defined hydrogen bond by using a set of configurational
criteria. If the O···D distance is less than the distance
of first minimum of the intermolecular O···D radial
distribution function and the O···O distance is less
than the first minimum of the O···O radial distribution
function, then a hydrogen bond exists between the two water molecules.
An OD mode is considered to be dangling or free when it is not hydrogen-bonded.
Like hydrogen bond dynamics, we have also calculated the correlation
function (SDB(t)) of
free OD bond dynamics by using a similar population correlation function
approach.52 The results are shown in Figure 5a,b. The corresponding
lifetimes, τHB and τDB, are given
in Table 3. It can
be seen from Table 3 that for the higher density systems (1.1 g cm–3), τDB is less than τHB for both N = 32 and 64. Thus, for higher density, an OD bond remains
free for a shorter time than it remains hydrogen-bonded even at supercritical
temperature. Similar observation can also be made for ambient water
(Table 3) although
the absolute values of the timescales are much longer for ambient
water. For the lower density systems, however, the two timescales
of τHB and τDB are found to follow
a reverse order with τHB now less than τDB (Table 3).
Thus, for the lower density systems of 0.78 and 0.39 g cm–3, an OD bond remains free for a longer period compared to the period
over which it remains hydrogen-bonded. Because the dynamics of hydrogen
bond breaking and reformation are believed to be the primary factors
which influence the OD frequency changes, the shorter timescale of
the frequency fluctuations (τ1) may be linked to
the shorter of the two timescales of hydrogen bond and free OD bond
dynamics, that is τHB and τDB, while
the longer timescale may be connected to the longer of τHB and τDB. However, a close look at the numerical
values of Tables 2 and 3 reveal that this linking of τ1 to the shorter and τ2 to the longer of τHB and τDB is not perfect. This means the
dynamics of frequency fluctuations is not merely determined by the
dynamics of associated hydrogen bond breaking and reformation, but
other dynamical modes, possibly involving more than just the nearest
neighbor, also contributing to the frequency fluctuations of an OD
mode. Also, in addition to the free OD modes, the relaxation of weakly
hydrogen-bonded modes is also expected to contribute to the dynamics
at the higher frequency side. This is more so because of the simple
geometric definition that we have used to characterize the free OD
modes. A more robust geometric definition of the free O–H modes
of water has been provided recently by Nagata and co-workers53 in the context of air–water interfaces.
Regarding the effects of dispersion corrections, we note that the
hydrogen bond lifetime for pure water under ambient conditions for
the BLYP-D functional is shorter than that produced by the BLYP functional.54 Thus, under ambient conditions, the BLYP-D functional
produces a faster hydrogen bond dynamics. For supercritical water
also, the BLYP-D functional is found to produce a slightly faster
dynamics compared to that for the BLYP functional, although the timescales
of supercritical water are rather short, and the changes in relaxation
times may be within the scattering caused by system size effects.

5 Rotational Dynamics of OD Bonds and Translational
Diffusion
We have also calculated the density dependence
of the dynamics
of rotational motion of OD bonds of water molecules under supercritical
conditions. It is known from previous studies that rotational motion
plays an important role in the breaking of hydrogen bond dynamics
and hence in the spectral diffusion.29,55−59 Therefore, it would be interesting to see to what extent the dispersion
interaction affects this motion. In Figure 6, we have shown the decay of orientational
function ⟨cos θ(t)⟩, where θ(t) is the angle between the orientation of an OD vector
at times 0 and t, and the average is carried out
over all the OD bonds present in a system. A biphasic decay is clearly
seen in the figure. There is a fast decay due to inertial rotation
of the molecules which is followed by a relatively slower decay. The
timescales of the biexponential fit (τrotfast and τrotslow) and associated weights are given
in Table 4. At low
density (0.39 g cm–3), the increasing weight factor
of fast inertial motion of OD mode is found to be a key factor for
the hydrogen bond dynamics and spectral diffusion because the faster
timescale in spectral diffusion is very much closer to the hydrogen
bond lifetime and inertial rotational time at low density. At higher
density (1.1 g cm–3), the hydrogen bond lifetime
is found to be longer than the inertial rotational time. As the coefficient
of inertial component is relatively small at higher density, the vibrational
spectral diffusion of water molecules generally takes place through
slower dynamics of hydrogen bond breaking. Thus, the hydrogen bond
breaking is believed to be responsible for the slower component of
the spectral diffusion at higher density. The inclusion of dispersion
correction produces slight changes in the rotational dynamics of supercritical
water. However, such changes appear to be not so significant because
under supercritical conditions the molecular dynamics of water molecules
is very fast due to thermal effects. In other words, the strong thermal
effects take over any small changes that might be introduced by weak
dispersion corrections.

a The values shown in brackets are

To see the effects of dispersion corrections on the translational
motion of water molecules, we have calculated the diffusion coefficient
of water molecules for both functionals by calculating the mean square
displacements. The diffusion coefficient is found to be ∼30
(47.4) (×10–5 cm2 s–1) and ∼113.0 (89.27) (×10–5 cm2 s–1) for the density of 0.78 and 0.39 g
cm–3, respectively, for the BLYP-D (BLYP) functional
at supercritical conditions for N = 32. The current
result of the diffusion coefficient at the lower density (0.39 g cm–3) can be compared with the available experimental
value of 137 ± 7 (×10–5 cm2 s–1) at 0.23 g cm–3 at 673 K.60 For the higher density system (1.1 g cm–3) with N = 64, the diffusion coefficient
is found to be 20 (18.9) (×10–5 cm2 s–1). Clearly, significant dependence of the diffusion
coefficient on system size is found for supercritical water when N is changed from 32 to 64. The effect of the system size
on diffusion was also found to be significant for ambient water in
earlier studies.61

6 Dipole
Moment Distributions
At supercritical conditions, the dynamics
of water molecules is
very fast. The solvation properties of supercritical water also differ
very much from those of ambient water. The reduction of polarity and
the reduced hydrogen bond formation ability are believed to be the
key factors for this altered solvation feature.29 Thus, we have calculated the average dipole moment of water
molecules for the current systems. The dipole moments of individual
water molecules in the supercritical conditions at three different
densities have been calculated by using the maximally localized Wannier
functions and Wannier function centers method.62,63 We have observed that the average dipole moment of a molecule decreases
on reduction of density for both the functionals. Overall, only small
changes in the dipole moment are found when the results are compared
for the two different functionals at a particular density. The results
of the dipole distributions are shown in Figure 7, and the values for the average dipole moments
are given in Table 5 for both the functionals. The results of dipole moment distribution
of water molecules under ambient conditions have also been included
in Figure 7 for comparison.

7 Summary and Conclusions
We have carried out first principles
molecular dynamics simulations
of supercritical water at three different densities using the dispersion-corrected
BLYP-D functional. Calculations with the BLYP functional are also
done for a system with a larger number of water molecules. It is found
that at supercritical conditions, the peak height of the O···O
radial distribution function of supercritical water decreases with
decrease of density of pure water. The peak heights of O···O
and O···D radial distribution functions for the BLYP-D
functional are found to be greater than that of the BLYP functional.
The difference between the peak heights of the radial distribution
functions for the BLYP and BLYP-D functionals is found to increase
with decrease of density. Slight changes in the dynamical properties
are also found on inclusion of dispersion corrections. At supercritical
temperature, the dispersion-corrected BLYP-D functional is found to
produce very similar hydrogen bond dynamics as the BLYP functional
for both higher and lower densities. In case of the free OD bond dynamics,
the difference between the two functionals is found to be very small
at higher densities, but some noticeable differences are found at
the two lower densities. Also, when the system size is increased from
32 to 64 water molecules for the higher density, some noticeable changes
in the structural and dynamical properties of supercritical water
are found. These changes due to system size effects are generally
not large but still they fall in a similar range as the changes caused
by the dispersion corrections, which means further simulations of
even bigger systems would be required to arrive at numbers that are
converged with respect to the system size. This issue of system size
effects is further discussed below. From the present BLYP and BLYP-D
results for a given system size, it may be concluded that the dispersion
corrections have only minor effects on the vibrational spectral diffusion
and other dynamical properties of water under supercritical conditions.

We finally note that although the present study involved many ab
initio simulations of supercritical water of different density, functional,
and system size, still it can be further extended in many directions.
The main limitations of the current study are (i) use of a rather
small system size (N = 32) for most of the simulations
except two systems where N = 64 was used, and (ii)
use of only one dispersion corrected functional (BLYP-D) where many
other choices are also available in the literature. As discussed in
earlier sections, noticeable effects of system size are found in our
calculations. The box length for the N = 32 systems
is rather small at the higher density, and it cuts through the second
peak of the oxygen–oxygen radial distribution function, which
means that the description of the second solvation shell around a
given water is incomplete for the higher density system for N = 32. This inappropriate description of the second solvation
shell likely affects the overall structure and dynamics of the system.
In fact, the issue of the system size could be even more important
for supercritical water, where large density fluctuations would require
larger boxes. Thus, it would be worthwhile to extend the current study
to larger systems, possibly with N = 128, 256, and
beyond, to verify the convergence of the results with respect to the
system size and also to examine how does the convergence of supercritical
water compare with that of ambient water with respect to the system
size. In the current paper, we have still chosen to present the results
of N = 32 and 64 systems because these results show
the extent of system size effects in this smaller region of N, which would be useful for future studies. Also, for a
given N (=32 or 64), the current simulations provide
us an important information that the dispersion corrections in the
structure and dynamics of supercritical water are not as important
as they were found for ambient water. Regarding the second point of
the use of only BLYP-D functional which falls under the scheme of
the so-called DFT-D2,34,35 we note that there are many other
alternative and possibly more accurate schemes available to include
dispersion corrections such as DFT-D3,64 DFT-vdW,65 and so on. While DFT-D2 has
proven to be accurate enough in many situations, the case of supercritical
water can be challenging in terms of quantitative accuracy because
of large density fluctuations. Certainly, it would be interesting
and also worthwhile to consider some of the other schemes of dispersion
corrections in ab initio simulations of supercritical water. We hope
to address some of these issues in our future work.

8 Computational Details
The ab initio simulations were performed
by using the method of
Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics,66 where the quantum many-body potentials and forces are calculated
on-the-fly through quantum electronic structure calculations. The
electronic structure of the extended simulation systems was represented
by the Kohn–Sham (KS)67 formulation
of density functional theory within plane wave basis. The core electrons
were treated via the norm-conserving pseudo potentials of Troullier–Martins,68 and the plane wave expansion of the KS orbitals
was truncated at a kinetic energy cut-off of 70 Ry. We have used a
fictitious orbital mass of μ = 800 a.u.69 and a simulation time step of 3 a.u. The hydrogen atoms were assigned
the mass of deuterium to decouple the dynamics of the ionic and electronic
subsystems over the simulation run length. Thus, we have considered
D2O rather than H2O in the current simulations.
The BLYP-D functional has been used, which incorporates dispersion
corrections at the D2 level34,35 into the BLYP32,33 functional. As described below, we have performed simulations at
fixed densities in NVT and NVE ensembles. Thus, adjustment or equilibration
of the density due to dispersion corrections was not considered in
the present study. It may, however, be noted that recent simulations
of ambient water in the NPT ensemble have shown that the BLYP functional
with D2 dispersion correction predicts the density of liquid water
in close agreement with the experimental value at normal temperature
and pressure.70

We have run a total
of four different simulations with the BLYP-D
functional and another four with the BLYP functional. We used the
CPMD code71 for all the present simulations.
The first three systems are at density of 1.1, 0.78, and 0.39 g cm–3. All these systems contain 32 water molecules periodically
replicated in all dimensions. The length of the box is 9.8652 Å
for the density of 1.1 g cm–3, 11.12 Å for
0.78 g cm–3, and 13.98 Å for the density of
0.39 g cm–3, respectively. Each system was equilibrated
for approximately 10 ps in a canonical (NVT) ensemble. Subsequently,
each system was further run for ∼30 ps in the microcanonical
(NVE) ensemble for calculations of various structural and dynamical
properties. Also, to see the effects of system size, we have also
run simulations of a bigger system of 64 water molecules using the
BLYP and BLYP-D functionals. The edge length of the cubic box of this
bigger system is 12.418 Å. These systems were equilibrated for ∼15
ps in the NVT ensemble, and then, they were run for another 30 ps
in the NVE ensemble for calculations of the structural and dynamical
properties. We have defined our simulation systems as systems 1, 2,
and 3 for the densities of 1.1, 0.78, and 0.39 g cm–3 and N = 32, where N is the number
of water molecules. System 4 is for the density of 1.1 g cm–3 and N = 64. The functional is mentioned explicitly
in each case whenever the results are discussed. The BLYP results
for the smaller systems of the current study are found to be in agreement
with the earlier results of ref (29). The BLYP-D results at room temperature are
obtained from the trajectory of ref (41) for bulk water molecules. We have verified through
an additional simulation that the results of bulk water of ref (41) are very close to that
of pure water for the same system size and temperature.

After
the trajectories were generated, we calculated the fluctuating
frequencies of OD bonds by using the wavelet method.72−75 More details on the OD frequency calculations using this method
are available in refs;29,54,76 hence, here we include only the key details. A wavelet can be visualized
as a small ripple or a wave with a compact support with an associated
frequency. The wavelet transformation of a time-dependent function f(t) is defined as 4  where  is the complex conjugate of a
mother wavelet
with two tunable parameters a and b. Clearly, the right hand side of the above equation represents the
overlap between the mother wavelet and the function f(t). Following the earlier work,76 we have taken f(t) as
the time-dependent fluctuations in the OD bond distance and the corresponding
momentum along the simulation trajectory. We have considered the commonly
used Morlet–Grossman wavelet72 as
the mother wavelet 5  with λ = 1 and σ = 2. The wavelet
transformation of the time-dependent fluctuations is then carried
out for different values of a for different given
values of b. The value of a, which
maximizes the wavelet transform of the above equation, gives the corresponding
frequency (obtained from the parameter a) at the
time given by the parameter b.
