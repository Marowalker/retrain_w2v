The holy grail in nanoelectronics
is the construction of nanodevices
with high density, low cost, and high performance per device and per
integrated circuit. One approach is the fabrication of surface nanostructures
and atomic-scale templates via the autonomous assembly of atoms and/or
molecules on well-defined surfaces. To steer the atomic or molecular
growth processes and create a wide range of surface nanostructures
with desired properties, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms
that control the surface self-assembly processes is required. The
capability to manipulate the nanodevices at the submolecular level
with good controllability is also of paramount importance. This review
highlights some key recent developments in the fabrication of low-dimensional
nanostructures based on supramolecular self-assembly on predefined
surfaces, with particular emphasis on the rapidly expanding field
of two-dimensional materials. Special attention is also given to the
latest progress in single-molecule manipulation for future device
applications.

1 Introduction
Nanostructured materials
with length scales in the range of ∼0.1–100
nm in at least one dimension are of great interest for their unique
properties and potential applications in future nanodevices.1 To build surface nanostructures and atomic-scale
templates with desired functionalities, much effort has been allocated
to understand and manipulate individual atoms and molecules on well-defined
surfaces. Rapid developments in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology
have been achieved over the last 30 years or so with the invention
and refinement of a variety of fabrication and characterization tools.
Among various promising methods are included molecular beam epitaxy
to fabricate well-ordered ultrathin films on surfaces and scanning
probing microscopy to characterize spatial morphology and electronic
properties with atomic resolution. A wide range of well-organized
nanostructures have been fabricated, for example, isolated individuals/clusters,
one-dimensional chains/ribbons, and two-dimensional (2D) extended
networks, which can be used as quantum dots, high-density data storage
media, sensors, spin valves, and so on.2−4 However, significant
challenges remain in nanostructure fabrication and device operation
with high stability, repeatability, and controllability, particularly
in high temperature and under ambient conditions.

A promising
bottom-up route to fabricate regular nanostructures
over large macroscopic areas is the autonomous assembly of atoms and/or
molecules on well-defined surfaces. In general, the spontaneous formation
of self-assembled nanostructures is determined by the competing adsorbate–adsorbate
and adsorbate–substrate interactions. By the rational design
and selection of the building blocks and the supporting surfaces or
predefined templates, we are able to steer the formation of nanopatterns
via the selective coupling of functional constituents to specific
adsorption sites on the substrates, that is, reconstructed surfaces5 and periodic (porous) nanonetworks6 or the directionality of lateral adsorbate–adsorbate
interactions such as metal–ligand interactions7 and intermolecular hydrogen/covalent bonding.3,8 When the dimension goes down to the nanometer scale, various physical
phenomena, such as quantum confinement effects and surface/interface
interactions, play critical roles in determining the electronic and
optical properties of the nanostructured materials, which are significantly
different from their bulk components. Therefore, the capability to
construct robust and tunable nanostructures with varying sizes, shapes,
and hence functionalities is required to fulfill the demanding requirements
from various device types.

In this perspective, we will briefly
review the latest progress
in the fabrication and characterization of low-dimensional nanostructures
on predefined surfaces based on supramolecular self-assembly. We will
focus particularly on site-selective adsorptions on various surface
templates, from the well-known Au(111)-(22 × √23)-reconstructed
structure to the new 2D materials including graphene, h-BN, and single-layer
transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) supported by metallic substrates
with geometric and electronic corrugations (sections 2-4). We then discuss
the surface-assisted synthesis of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons
(GNRs) from small molecular precursors in section 5. Advances in scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) combined with noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM) in surface
characterization will also be addressed. Developments in single-molecule
operations with increasing density, tunability, and thermal stability
for device applications are presented in section 6. We conclude with our perspective on the
future outlook for this field.

2 Molecular Self-Assembly on
Reconstructed Surfaces
Substrates with well-defined reconstructions
can serve as templates
for molecular self-assembly. As a prototype reconstructed surface,
the Au(111)-(22 × √23) surface is composed of valleys,
ridges, and elbows that result from alternating face-centered cubic
(fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) regions. Previous works have
shown the formation of various surface atom/molecule nanostructures
mediated by the Au(111) reconstruction structure.5,9−15 Elegant examples are demonstrated in Figure 1b,e, where 4′-(4-methylphenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine
(SND) molecules16 (Figure 1a) and [30]trithia-2,3,5,10,12,13,15,20,22,23,25,30-dodecaazahexaphyrin
(HTAP) molecules17 (Figure 1d) prefer to first reside at the elbow and
then the valley of the Au(111) surface at low coverages. A clear hierarchy
for selective adsorption is observable for the two coexisting elbow
sites denoted as X and Y in Figure 1b, as the single SND molecules first decorate the X
elbows, whereas the Y elbows remain free.

Figure 1 Selective adsorption
of organic molecules on the Au(111)-reconstructed
surface. (a) Chemical structure of SND (Swiss Nano Dragster) molecule
and (b) STM image revealed that the molecules first adsorbed at specific
elbows donated “X” and then along the valleys of hcp
and fcc reconstruction at low coverage. (c) STM (top) and AFM (bottom)
images of the SND molecules in fcc/hcp valley (left) and X-elbow (right).
(d) HTAP molecular structure and (e) STM image of HTAP adsorbed on
the Au(111) elbows and in the fcc regions at low coverage. (f) Long-range
STM image shows substrate-mediated orientation growth of HTAP on Au(111)
at high molecular coverage. Green or blue triangles highlight the
two orientations adopted by the HTAP molecules. (b,c) Reproduced with
permission from ref (16) and (e,f) from ref (17).

With advances in the combined
STM/AFM techniques,18 investigations of
single organic molecules on surfaces
reveal better insights into local conformational changes. Figure 1c shows typical STM/AFM
images of the SND molecule located at the valley (left column) and
X elbow (right column), respectively. STM images do not reveal drastic
differences; however, the corresponding AFM images clearly show a
conformational change and suggest a variation of the interactions
between the SND pyridine units and the underlying Au atoms at different
adsorption sites. As such a subtle interplay between the molecular
adsorption and the underlying surface potential governs the diffusion
processes as well as the friction forces of complex molecules at surfaces,
such investigations could help facilitate the design for future molecular
nanovehicles.19,20

The Au(111) reconstruction
can also template the long-range ordering
of the adsorbed molecules.9,17 In Figure 1f, HTAP molecules align into
one preferred orientation in the fcc or hcp regions as the molecular
coverage increases, and the supramolecular orientation alternates
the neighboring fcc and hcp regions, as highlighted by the green and
blue triangles, respectively. The long-range orientational self-assembly
is stabilized by S···H intermolecular hydrogen bonding
as well as molecule–substrate interactions.

Other notable
well-ordered molecular arrays engineered by the site-specific
interactions between the adsorbed molecules and the periodically reconstructed
substrates are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a
shows a nanomesh template formed on the 6H–SiC(0001) surface
upon annealing. The quasihoneycomb nanomesh corresponds to the 6√3
× 6√3R30° reconstruction of a single
graphene-like carbon layer partially covalently bonded to the truncated
SiC surface.21−23 Upon deposition of 0.85 ML chloroaluminum phthalocyanine
(ClAlPc) molecules, a well-ordered single-layer dipole array was observed
on the SiC nanomesh, as shown in Figure 2b.24 As each ClAlPc
exclusively adsorbs at the center of the SiC nanomesh holes in a Cl-up
configuration, the intermolecular distance of ∼1.85 nm is determined
by the underlying template, in contrast to that of 1.51 nm for the
close-packed ClAlPc on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.25 The alignment of the ClAlPc molecular dipole
and the out-of-plane component of the surface dipole of the SiC nanomesh
play a crucial role in the formation of the ClAlPc nanoarrays.

Figure 2 (a) Typical
large-scale STM image shows the carbon nanomesh template
(the so-called 6√3 × 6√3R30°
reconstruction) on the 6H–SiC(0001) surface formed by annealing.

In Figure 2d,e,
the square p(10 × 10) reconstruction of Bi on
Cu(100) enables the assembly of manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) and
copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecules into a chessboard pattern.26 The CuPc molecules prefer to adsorb at the pore
sites (dark regions), whereas the MnPc (or cobalt phthalocyanine)
molecules adsorb at the nodes (bright regions). The chessboard assemblies
are mainly driven by the site-specific interactions between the central
transition-metal ions of the Pc molecules and the reconstructed Bi
template.

3 Moiré Patterns in Single-Layer Graphene
and h-BN
Periodic moiré patterns formed in 2D layered
crystals on
a supported substrate can also serve as a template for nanostructure
formation.27Figure 3a represents a prototype moiré superstructure
induced by the lattice mismatch between a single-layer graphene (Gr)
and the Ru(0001) substrate.28 The three
distinct regions are defined as top (triangle), fcc (orange hexagon),
and hcp (blue hexagon). The graphene–metal distance varies
significantly from the fcc/hcp sites (∼2.1 Å) to the top
sites (>3.6 Å) and thereby the graphene–metal interactions,
which together result in a corrugation of the surface electronic potential
of over 0.3 eV across the moiré unit cell.29 Such significant geometric corrugation and periodic electronic
modulation are usually formed in graphene as well as h-BN monolayers30 grown on strongly interactive metals and play
an active role in the molecular assembly.

Gr/Ru(0001) with three distinct regions, top (triangles), fcc (orange

Kagomé lattice at sufficiently high coverage. (d) TCNQ monolayer

Figure 3b reveals
the site-selective adsorption of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules
on the Gr/Ru(0001) hexagonal moiré pattern. The molecules first
adsorb on the fcc region at low coverage. As the coverage increases
gradually, the molecules subsequently grow along the top fcc edges,
followed by a filling of the hcp regions.28 As a result, a Kagome lattice of FePc molecules on the epitaxial
Gr/Ru(0001) surface is formed in Figure 3c with the top regions remaining unoccupied.31 Combined with theoretical density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, the coupling of the polarized Pc molecules
to the surface dipole of the corrugated Gr/Ru(0001) moiré pattern
is suggested to dominate the hierarchical supramolecular assembly
to maximize the adsorption energy.

The assembly of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane
(TCNQ) molecules
on Gr/Ru(0001) demonstrates similar site-selective adsorption, where
the fcc/hcp regions are first decorated.32,33 However, the driving mechanism is different from the dipole mediation
for FePc as discussed above. As a strong electron acceptor with low
electron affinity, TCNQ tends to adsorb at the lower part of the Gr
ripples, where the electron density is higher and the local work function
is lower, to facilitate surface charge transfer. When the coverage
increases to a full monolayer, the molecules assemble into well-ordered
close-packed molecular arrays. As shown in Figure 3d, the TCNQ monolayer on Gr/Ru(0001) contains
two distinct features, with the brighter features at top sites. Further
investigations confirmed that the TCNQ molecules adsorbed at top sites
are neutral, whereas the ones at fcc/hcp sites are negatively charged
and give rise to Kondo resonance. Additionally, the spin-polarized
dI/dV spectra taken at the different
molecular domains (Figure 3e) reveal the existence of magnetic contrast because of the
formation of long-range magnetic order in the TCNQ monolayer, which
might have potential applications as a spin filter or polarizer.33

Monolayer h-BN as a nanotemplate for molecular
assembly has also
been carefully studied.34−39 Analogous to graphene, the h-BN single layers grown on metal substrates
also exhibit selective adsorption of molecules because of the presence
of a hexagonal moiré pattern. Figure 3f demonstrates that MnPc molecules are selectively
trapped on the pores of the h-BN/Rh(111) ripples.38 Three types of MnPc with different topographic characteristics
can be identified, as highlighted by the red, blue, and yellow circles.
Detailed investigations and DFT calculations verify that the different
topographic signatures can be assigned to multiple charged and neutral
molecular states with different energy-level positions, which significantly
depend on the adsorption site and orientation of the MnPc molecules
with respect to the h-BN moiré surface.

Similarly, free-base
porphyrin (2H-P) and TCNQ also exhibit preferential
adsorption behavior on the h-BN/Cu(111) surface.39 A highly ordered array of the 18-2H-P-molecule clusters
forms at the coverage of ∼0.4 ML, as shown in Figure 3g. The superstructure with
a periodicity of 7 nm is identical to the underlying h-BN/Cu(111)
moiré template. When the coverage exceeds 0.4 ML, the 18-molecule
clusters disintegrate and the 2H-P molecules form extended highly
ordered porous networks with a periodicity of 3.2 nm (Figure 3h). Obviously, the template
effect is overridden when the number of molecules is high enough.

The formation of molecular nanostructures on such 2D moiré
patterns is actually complicated and varies from molecule to molecule
and material to material, as they are determined by the weak interactions
between the molecules and the substrate.27 No preferential adsorption is observed when the surface potential
corrugation of the moiré-patterned substrates is very small.40,41 This observation is also consistent in other 2D materials including
TMD monolayers supported by the underlying substrates.

4 2D TMD-Patterned Monolayers
Atomically layered TMDs are
the latest member of the 2D family,
and relevant studies of self-assembly are still at their infancy compared
to that of graphene and h-BN. Among the limited number of published
studies, a well-ordered closed-packed perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride
array has been fabricated on a single-layer WSe2 atop graphite
substrate, and the molecular highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital gap is enlarged by the WSe2 interlayer because of the reduced dielectric screening of the monolayer
TMD.42 Another study on C60F48 (fluorinated fullerene) assemblies reveals a surface liquid
to solid phase transformation with the increased molecular coverage.43 However, the formation of the liquid phase composed
of isolated C60F48 individuals is triggered
by the repulsive intermolecular interaction induced by interfacial
charge transfer, which has nothing to do with site-selective adsorption.44 The studies also indicate that the deposition
of organic molecular layers on 2D materials is a promising approach
to modify their electronic properties.

A prototype TMD monolayer
with an intrinsically patterned structure
was fabricated by Lin et al.—1H/1T PtSe2 monolayer
on a Pt(111) substrate grown by direct selenization in a poor Se environment.45 The atomic-resolution image in Figure 4a shows the triangular pattern
of monolayer 1H/1T PtSe2 constructed by alternating 1T
and 1H phases. Interestingly, when pentacene molecules are deposited,
they are selectively adsorbed within the 1H domains to form well-ordered
triangular clusters (Figure 4b,c). As the 1T and 1H phases of TMD materials usually possess
different electron densities as well as chemical reactivities, it
is no surprise that the patterned 1H/1T PtSe2 monolayer
can be utilized as a template for molecular self-assembly. In principle,
such preferential adsorptions of selected molecular species to one
specific domain could be used in dual functionalization for catalysis
or other applications.

pattern constructed by alternating 1T and 1H domains. (b) Pentacene
molecules selectively adsorb on the 1H phase region of PtSe2. (c) Enlarged STM image of a triangular molecular cluster. (a–c)

5 GNRs Fabricated by Molecular Precursors
Molecular
self-assembly on surfaces can also be harnessed to synthesize
unique low-dimensional nanostructures with useful properties. Among
various approaches to make the zero band gap graphene semiconducting,
the most promising is the fabrication of GNRs which can behave as
either a metal or a semiconductor depending on their widths and/or
edge structures.46−50 Compared to many top-down methods such as lithography or unzipping
carbon nanotubes, bottom-up methods to synthesize GNRs from small
molecular precursors have more advantages in atomically precise control
with predefined structures and widths.46,51−53 For example, straight armchair-edged GNRs with various widths can
be fabricated from 10,10′-dibromo-9,9′-bianthryl (DBBA)
monomers on the Ag(111) surface with two-step annealing (Figure 5a–e), by the
linear coupling and surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenation.54 Predefined by the molecular precursor, 7-, 14-,
and 21-GNRs can be formed, where the numbers denote the number of
carbon atoms in the direction perpendicular to the GNR axis. The STM
image in Figure 5e
reveals the different electron scattering patterns observed in the
7- and 21-GNRs induced by the width-dependent electronic structures.
Such width-dependent phenomena arising from the quantum confinement
effect have been widely explored in both theory and experiment.55−58

Figure 5 (a–d)
Schematic diagram shows the bottom-up synthesis of
atomically precise GNRs from the DBBA precursor with varying ribbon
widths. (e) STM image reveals the different electron scattering patterns
in 7- (lower) and 21-GNRs (upper) on Ag(111). (f) Schematic drawing

boron-doped precursor molecules (C40H24B2Br2). (g) Large-scale STM image showing the fused
B-GNR with different widths on the Au(111) surface by further annealing

filtered image for a better view (lower left panel) and the theoretical
simulated AFM image (lower right panel). (a–e) Reprinted with

A variety of GNRs, such
as chevron-type GNRs,59,60 junctions,52,57,61,62 as well as
N- or B-doped GNRs,63−65 have been fabricated by different molecular precursors. Figure 5f–h shows
an elegant example of the synthesis of boron-doped GNRs (B-GNRs) by
an organoboron precursor on the Au(111) surface.64 After annealing at an elevated temperature (510 °C),
B-GNRs with various widths were obtained by the fusion of the armchair
edges (Figure 5g).
In Figure 5h, the chemical
and structural properties of the B-GNR are well-resolved by a combination
of high-resolution STM and AFM techniques, revealing a doping density
of 4.8 atom %. Such substitutionaly doped GNRs further demonstrate
higher chemical reactivity compared to that of the nondoped ribbons.
This indicates that the low-dimensional carbon-based materials with
better device performance and wider applicants are achievable by proper
functionalization.

6 Toward Device Applications
The ultimate practical aim of the fabrication and investigation
of nanostructures is the design of single-molecule-based functional
devices using individual molecules as diodes, switches, data storage
bits, magnets, or spin valves. The realization of such molecular devices
largely depends on our ability to manipulate a single molecule between
multiple conformational, chemical, electronic, or spin-valley states.
Intensive research efforts have been devoted to trigger and understand
the single-molecule operations by various external sources, such as
light, temperature, electric/magnetic field, inelastic tunneling electron,
and so on.66

The ClAlPc molecule
represents a prototype nonplanar molecule,
which possesses two distinct electric dipole configurations on a surface,
namely, Cl-up (“1”) and Cl-down (“0”),
as shown in Figure 6a. In 2012, Huang et al. demonstrated that a reversible switching
between the Cl-up and the Cl-down configurations with good controllability
and repeatability can be realized in close-packed ClAlPc molecular
arrays at 77 K.25 The switching direction
is simply controlled by the polarity of the tip voltage pulses and
the two states can be easily distinguished because the Cl-up state
has a much brighter central protrusion (Figure 6b). This work demonstrates the capability
of writing, reading, and erasing single binary bits of information
with single-molecule precisions. Such ordered monolayer molecular
dipole arrays can serve as an ultrahigh-density storage device with
the capacity of around 40 Tb/cm2. In 2014, Zhang et al.
further demonstrated that the molecular bit density is tunable by
a controlled deposition of a guest molecule, that is, perfluoropentacene
(PFP), into the ClAlPc dipole arrays.67 Various binary networks were fabricated with different binary molecular
ratios, for example, Figure 6c shows a ClAlPc/PFP network with a ratio of 1:2, and Figure 6d,e shows another
with a ratio of 1:1. Although the binary networks are stabilized by
weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the neighboring ClAlPc
and PFP molecules, reversible dipole switching is nevertheless well-controlled
(Figure 6d,e).

Figure 6 (a) Schematic
drawing shows the reversible single-molecule switching
induced by STM tip pulses. (b) In the well-ordered ClAlPc molecular
dipole arrays, the Cl-down molecules (“0”) were switched
from Cl-up molecules (“1”) by positive voltage pulses,
and the switch can be reversibly controlled by negative pulses. (c–e)
Density of the single-molecular bits can be tuned and controlled by
the deposition of a guest molecule, that is, PFP. The reversible switching
is not affected by the neighboring molecules in the binary molecular
network. (f)Model shows an AND logic gate and the operation of the
proposed molecular device. (g) Demonstration of the manipulation process
of the logic gate via the STM tip to input signals. The orientational
information can be transferred from one molecule to another via effective
intermolecular coupling along the molecular array at room temperature.
(a,b) Reprinted with permission from ref (25); (c–e) from ref (67); and (f,g) from ref (68).

In 2017, Li et al. presented a practical realization of signal
transmission and processing at room temperature using in-plane molecular
orientation as the information carrier.68 The proposed model for an AND logic gate is shown in Figure 6f. The operation is based on
the fact that the tin phthalocyanine dichloride molecules adsorbed
on the Cu(111) surface can rotate between two stable in-plane orientations,
which are effectively coupled to each other via lateral intermolecular
interactions along the molecular chains, and the orientations are
controllable with STM tip pulses. As demonstrated in Figure 6g, when the “0”
signal (β orientation) is input into either A or B molecule,
the output obtained from Y is “0”; in contrast, when
the “1” signal (α orientation) is input into both
A and B molecules, the output becomes “1”. As such,
molecular logic gates, OR and AND, can be constructed and operated
with good thermal stability at room temperature.

7 Conclusions
and Outlook
In conclusion, surface molecular assembly is
a promising approach
for fabricating atomically precise nanostructures and templates with
desired functionalities for applications in future nanodevices. We
predict that there will be increasing research interest in supramolecular
nanostructures formed on 2D materials because of their novel and tunable
optoelectronic and other exotic properties. Organic 2D nanostructures
allow us to harness the advantages of both 2D materials and organic
semiconductors to create layered assemblies with unique functions
for flexible devices. The selective deposition of organic molecular
layers is also an efficient bottom-up approach to functionalize 2D
crystals (e.g., selected strong organic dopants to tune the carrier
type/concentration and the Fermi level position of graphene and 2D
TMDs) for robust device applications. A comprehensive understanding
of the chemical, geometrical, and electronic properties of such molecular
nanostructures is now possible with the combination of atomically
resolved STM and AFM techniques. More work is needed to identify robust
molecular nanostructures which can perform useful operations at the
atomic scale with high controllability.
