Naringin, a Chinese herbal medicine,
has been demonstrated to concentration-dependently
promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
However, it remains a challenge to load naringin on coatings for osteogenesis
and further control the release kinetics. Here, we demonstrated that
the release behavior of naringin on rutile nanorod films could be
controlled by either mixing naringin with gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)
before spinning onto the films or soaking the obtained GelMA-incorporated
films with the naringin solution to achieve the distinct degradation-type
release and diffusion-type release, respectively. We further revealed
that the naringin-loaded coatings facilitated adhesion, proliferation
and late differentiation, and mineralization of MSCs. Our findings
provided a novel strategy to engineer the coatings with controlled
release of naringin and emphasized the bioactivity of naringin for
the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.

Introduction
Naringin, a Chinese traditional herb,
is the main active component
of Rhizoma drynariae. It has been demonstrated to
be able to promote the adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenesis of
cells.1,2 The biological activities of naringin express
a dose-dependent manner. For example, Liu et al. proved that naringin
enhanced the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human
amniotic fluid-derived stem cells in the range 1–100 μg/mL,
while an inhibition effect occurred at 200 μg/mL.3 Li et al. found that 10 μg/mL naringin
showed the most remarkable effect on osteocalcin expression of rat
bone marrow stromal cells.4 Therefore,
it is necessary to control the release of naringin to optimize its
function.

Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) is one type of hydrogel
biomaterials
which attracts the attention to control the release of drug. Researchers
have proved that GelMA could provide sustained and localized presentation
of drug after a burst release.5−7 Furthermore, GelMA has been demonstrated
to regulate the fate of stem cells by mimicking the physiochemical
properties of the extracellular matrix. Nichol et al. demonstrated
that cells readily proliferated and elongated on the surface of GelMA
hydrogel.8 Fang et al. found that Bio-GelMA
significantly enhanced proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
activity of encapsulated adipose-derived stem cells.9 We, therefore, speculated that GelMA might be a suitable
carrier to control the release of naringin and meanwhile promote the
osteogenesis of stem cells. However, it remains to be discovered how
to load naringin in GelMA and how to fix GelMA as a coating on the
surface of biomaterials.

With the development of nanotechnologies,
we have seen great progress
in surface modification of implants during the past few years.10 The TiO2 film on the implant surface
with good stability has attracted a lot of interest. TiO2 nanorod films have been demonstrated to be osteo-conductivity.11−13 Moreover, Ge et al. found that mesoporous bioactive glass incorporated
with TiO2 nanorod films could restrain the initial burst
release of rhBMP-2 and improve rhBMP-2 function.14 Thus, rutile nanorod films were selected here to fix GelMA.

In this study, naringin was loaded by two distinct manners in GelMA
incorporated on TiO2 nanorod coatings to realize controlled
release. Also, a series of in vitro experiments were carried out to
evaluate their activities for osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs).

Results
The surface morphologies
of TiO2 nanorod coatings before
and after GelMA incorporation were observed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). As shown in Figure 1A, the dimension and height of nanorods were nearly 100 and
600 nm, respectively. These results were consistent with our previous
work.15 The distinct spacing between nanorods
was further beneficial for the incorporation of GelMA (Figure 1B). As shown in Figure 1C, the release profile of naringin
was sustained after an apparent burst release. We also analyzed the
release kinetics (Figure 1D,E). During the first stage of burst release, the intercept
represented the initial percentage of released naringin. The parameter
was 2.70 for naringin-M and 14.99 for naringin-S, which suggested
that more drug might be reserved in naringin-M. During the second
stage of sustained release, the slope represented the rate of released
behavior. The parameter was 3.76 for naringin-M and 3.01 for naringin-S,
which revealed higher concentration of naringin released from naringin-M
in unit time. According to the release kinetics, we inferred that
these two typical coatings with distinct release kinetics of naringin
could provide an ideal model to further explore their activities for
osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.

behaviors for naringin-M and naringin-S, respectively.

We first observed that the cellular morphology on various
substrates.
As shown in Figure 2, the morphology of MSCs cultured on naringin-M and naringin-S remarkably
displayed more filopodia compared to that of the other two substrates.
These results suggested that the coatings loaded with naringin promoted
the spreading of MSCs.

accordingly. Filopodia were indicated by the arrow.

Immunofluorescence was further employed to observe the adhesion
behaviors of MSCs on various substrates. As shown in Figure 3A, the cellular area was larger
on naringin-M and naringin-S compared to on that of cells on Ti and
GelMA. Moreover, quantitative analysis also confirmed the obvious
attachment and spreading of MSCs on the coatings loaded with naringin
especially on day 3 (Figure 3B). It was worth to note that MSCs on naringin-M displayed
more vinculin with higher fluorescence intensity than the others on
day 3.

nuclei (blue). (B) Cytomorphometric evaluation of area, perimeter,
and Feret’s diameter. (C) Quantitative analysis of fluorescence

The cellular viability and proliferation were evaluated by
using
live/dead assay and CCK-8 assay. As shown in Figure 4A, the density of MSCs increased obviously
on naringin-M and naringin-S. Especially the number of attached cells
was significantly upregulated on naringin-M and naringin-S even after
5 days of culture. These results were further confirmed by the quantitative
analysis of CCK-8 results (Figure 4B), which could be attributed to the bioactivity of
naringin.

live cells were stained with calcein (green), and the dead cells were
stained with ethidium (red). (B) CCK-8 assays.

Assessment of osteogenesis genes was achieved by real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). The results are shown in Figure 5A. After 7 days of culture, all expressions
of osteogenic-related genes were upregulated on naringin-M compared
to the others. After 14 days of culture, there was no obvious difference
between the coatings loaded with naringin, but expression of osteogenesis
genes was notably upregulated when compared to Ti and GelMA. What
is more, the larger area of ALP-positive with higher intensity displayed
on naringin-M and naringin-S than on the two others after 7 days of
culture as shown in Figure 5B. Moreover, the quantitative analysis revealed remarkably
upregulated ALP activity on naringin-M (Figure 5C).

Discussion
Recently, GelMA has been
widely used to control the drug delivery.
GelMA, acting as carriers, can interact with drug by physisorption
and covalent linking. In general, drug delivery from GelMA is mediated
by diffusion and degradation.16 At first,
diffusion dominances the release profile because matrix degradation
is slow.17 Drug is immobilized by macro/nano-entrapment.
Once GelMA is dissolved in the solvent, the diffusion of drug from
the porous structure occurs. The molecular weight of drugs and the
pore size of GelMA play important roles in the release process.18−20 The degradation of GelMA can be divided into bulk and surface erosion.16 Bulk erosion is homogenous when GelMA swelling
is faster than the polymer disintegration. In contrast, surface erosion
is heterogeneous when the polymer disintegration is predominant. A
number of parameters are related in the process such as the chemical
structure of GelMA, exposure time to UV light, the concentration of
the GelMA hydrogel, and others.21,22 In this work, we designed
two coatings to achieve degradation-type release (naringin-M) and
diffusion-type release (naringin-S). Naringin delivery was constant
and sustained after a burst release from two coatings (Figure 1C). However, the release kinetics
of two coating was different (Figure 1D,E). Because the molecular weight of naringin was
low, the entrapped naringin could be released from the porous structure
of GelMA easily. Therefore, the initial percentage of released naringin
from naringin-S was higher than that of naringin-M.

Moreover,
we demonstrated that the release of naringin was beneficial
to the attachment (Figure 3), osteogenesis (Figure 5), and mineralization (Figure 6) of MSCs. Though the biological activities
of naringin have been confirmed,23−25 the mechanism of its
osteo-conductivity is complicated and yet to be illuminated. Several
studies manifested that extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)
1/2 were found to be activated by naringin, and osteogenic differentiation
was repressed when the inhibitor of ERK 1/2 was used.26,27 The activation of ERK 1/2 is downstream of the Ras family.28 Lin et al. demonstrated that the Ras family
was remarkably activated by naringin.29 Furthermore, the ERK 1/2 pathway can regulate osteogenic differentiation
through microRNA.30 Meanwhile, GelMA hydrogels
and collagen have also been demonstrated to regulate the osteogenic
differentiation of MSCs via ERK signaling pathways.31,32 In this study, the osteogenic differentiation potential of MSCs
on naringin-M was more remarkable compared to that of naringin-S.
For the naringin-S, the naringin was entrapped in the pore structure
of GelMA and released quickly. When it comes to the naringin-M, the
naringin not only physically absorbed on GelMA but also covalently
bonded with GelMA during the curing process. Therefore, the detected
concentration of naringin released from naringin-M was lower than
that from naringin-S at the initial stage. Nonetheless, the synergistic
release of naringin with degraded GelMA from naringin-M enhanced the
osteogenic differentiation of MSCs more effectively. These results
suggested that there might be a synergistic effect of naringin and
GelMA to regulate the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs because of
the similar signaling pathway potentially involved, which needs further
investigation.

Conclusions
In summary, we designed
GelMA-incorporated rutile nanorod films
loaded with naringin which enhanced osteogenesis of MSCs. The release
behavior of naringin was shown to play a critical role in the fate
of MSCs. Despite two distinct coatings could both control the release
of naringin, the degradation-type release of naringin-M was demonstrated
to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs more effectively.
In all, our study may provide a potential strategy to achieve controlled
release of naringin and stress osteogenic function of naringin.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of the Four Typical Substrates
Four typical
substrates were prepared as following: Ti, GelMA (the GelMA hydrogel
incorporated rutile nanorod films), naringin-M (mixing naringin in
the GelMA hydrogel), and naringin-S (soaking the obtained GelMA with
the naringin solution). Rutile nanorod films were prepared by two
steps. First, quartz substrates (1 cm × 1 cm) were ultrasonically
cleaned by acetone (Hushi), absolute ethanol (Hushi), and distilled
water. Second, dissolved acetylacetone (62 μL; Aladdin), distilled
water (36 μL), tetrabutyl titanate (680 μL; Aladdin),
and polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.4 g; Ourchem) were diluted with ethanol
into 10 mL. Then, 20 μL of the solution was spin-coated on the
quartz substrate at the speed of 8000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, the substrates
were calcinated at 700 °C for 1 h to get nanodot films. The nanorod
films were further prepared by the following hydrothermal process.
The hydrothermal solution was prepared by mixing the 49 mL HCl (Hushi)
into 50 mL distilled water as well as the addition of 1020 μL
tetrabutyl titanate. The reaction was carried out at 160 °C for
2.5 h. After the reaction, the substrates were calcinated at 700 °C
for 1 h. The obtained nanorod films were then washed for three times
using water and ethanol. The topography of substrates was observed
by field-emission SEM (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU-70).

To prepare the
GelMA coatings on the nanorod films (GelMA substrate), 50 μL
of the GelMA hydrogel solution (5% GelMA hydrogel and 2.5 mg/mL type
I collagen solution in the volume ratio of 10:1) was spin-coated on
the rutile nanorod films at 8000 rpm for 40 s. The naringin-M substrate
was prepared by mixing the naringin (Sigma) to the hydrogel solution
to reach the final concentration of 1.4 g/L before spinning. Also,
the naringin-S substrate was prepared by soaking the GelMA substrate
in 1.4 g/L naringin solution.

Evaluation of the Release
Behaviors
To study the release
kinetics, naringin-M and naringin-S substrates were placed in a 24-multiwell
plate each containing 500 μL phosphate buffer saline (PBS, Genom).
At the corresponding point, the original PBS was collected for measurement
by ultraviolet spectroscopy at 415 nm and another new 500 μL
PBS was added to continue the release experiment. An empirical equation
simplified from the Higuchi equation, Q = kt1/2 + b, was applied. Q represents the total released percentage after time t, k reveals the rate of release behavior,
and b is the percentage of initial burst release.

Cell Culture and Seeding
MSCs were extracted from the
bone marrow of the tibias and femur of Sprague-Dawley rats (Slaccas).
MSCs were cultured in α-modified minimum essential medium (α-MEM;
Genom) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (ScienCell) and 1% penicillin
streptomycin (Genom) under a humidified atmosphere of 0.5% CO2 at 37 °C. The P3–P5 of MSCs were digested with
0.25% trypsin (Genom) and seeded on the surface of four substrates
with a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in a 24-multiwell
plate each containing 500 μL of the cell suspension. The culture
medium was renewed every other day.

Morphology of the Cells
The samples were fixed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde (Hushi) solution for 2 h at room temperature.
Then, the samples were rinsed with PBS three times. After this, 1%
osmic acid was used to fix the samples. The dehydration process was
achieved by gradient ethanol of 50, 70, 80, 95, and 100%. The samples
were dried and sprayed with gold. The morphology of cells was observed
by field-emission SEM (Hitachi SU-70).

Immunostaining of the Cells
After 1 and 3 days of culture,
the samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Biosharp)
for 20 min at room temperature. Then, the samples were rinsed with
PBS three times. 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS was supplemented to
rupture cell membranes for 10 min at 4 °C and then washed with
PBS. 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Biofrox) added with 2% FBS was
used as the sealant at 4 °C for 1 h. Focal adhesions were stained
with antivinculin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in 2% BSA at 4 °C
overnight. The samples were then rinsed with 0.05% Tween (Vetec) in
PBS three times. The actin cytoskeleton was stained by rhodamine phalloidin.
The cellular nuclei were stained using Dapi (Vector). Cells were visualized
by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Nikon, Japan). The quantitative
analysis was carried out using ImageJ software.

Cellular Viability
For live/dead staining of cells,
substrates were first rinsed with PBS and then stained by calcein-AM
and ethidium homodimer-1 for 30 min. Samples were observed by the
inverted fluorescent microscope. For the CCK-8 assay, at the designed
time points, 500 mL of the α-MEM medium and 50 mL of the CCK-8
(Dojindo) solution were added in each sample and incubated at 37 °C
for 2 h. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

Gene Expression
Analysis and ALP Activity
The cells
seeded on four substrates were collected on day 7 and day 14. RNA
was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then was reversed
into cDNA following DNAseI treatment. Real-time PCR was used to detect
the indicated gene level of ALP, RUNX2, and COL-1. The primers were
listed as following (Table 1).

For the ALP activity,
by the end of day 7, ALP Assay Kit (Beyotime)
was used to evaluate the ALP activity according to the manufacturer
protocol. Also, the resulting optical density values were detected
at 405 nm.

Evaluation of Mineralization
After
21 days of culture,
the samples were fixed using 70% ethanol for 1 h at room temperature
and incubated with 1% Alizarin Red S (Sigma) for 20 min. The calcium
nodule was observed by camera. After this, the samples were incubated
in PBS for 15 min and then in 10% cetylpyridinium chloride (Aladdin)
for 15 min. The quantitative analysis was achieved by measuring the
absorbance at 560 nm.

Statistical Analysis
The data were
expressed as the
mean ± standard error of the mean. Statistical significance test
was determined using ANOVA followed by Student’s t-test. *P < 0.5, **P < 0.01,
and ***P < 0.001 were considered to be statistically
different.
