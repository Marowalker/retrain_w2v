Carbon-based
materials, as electrodes for supercapacitors, have attracted tremendous
attention. Therefore, nitrogen-doped porous carbons (NPCs) were prepared
through a facile carbonization/activation strategy by treating different
mass ratios of melamine–urea–formaldehyde resin and
KOH. It is clearly demonstrated that because of the introduction of
KOH, the resulting NPCs were shown to have increased specific surface
area and a rich pore structure, and the best sample possessed a large
specific surface area of 2248 m2 g–1 and
high N content, which contributed to the good electrochemical performance
for supercapacitors. Accordingly, a three-electrode system assembles
NPCs as an electrode using aqueous KOH solution; the specific capacitance
was 341 F g–1 under the current density of 1 A g–1 and retained a specific capacitance of almost 92%
after 5000 cycles. The maximum energy output for a symmetrical solid-state
supercapacitor with NPCs as the electrode material was 9.60 W h kg–1 at 1 A g–1. NPCs have promising
applications on high-performance supercapacitors and other energy-storage
devices.

1 Introduction
The energy crisis poses a huge
challenge to the sustainable development of human society, forcing
humans to consider researching and developing efficient, clean, safe,
green, and high-performance energy storage and conversion materials
and equipment.1−5 Supercapacitors,
as a kind of green energy-storage device, have attracted extensive
attention because of its high power density, excellent rate performance,
and good reversibility along with long durability.6−10 Furthermore, the electrode materials play a vital
role in supercapacitors.11 Porous carbons
of excellent thermochemical stability, low toxicity, good electrical
conductivity, and large specific surface area have received extensive
attention in electrode materials.12−15 However, porous carbons
generally have defects such as poor energy density and lower specific
capacitance, which hinder the widespread application of carbon materials
in commercial supercapacitors.16−18 Therefore, developing high-performance porous carbon electrode materials
is still a huge challenge for researchers.

Many studies have
demonstrated that the electrochemical capability of porous carbons
can be promoted effectively by introducing functional groups such
as nitrogen,19 phosphorus,20 and sulfur.21 Incorporating
N atoms not only significantly promotes surface wettability, electrical
conductivity, and cycle stability of carbon materials but also increases
the pseudocapacitance through the Faraday reaction.22,23 In
general, a common strategy for preparing nitrogen-doped porous carbons
(NPCs) is by utilizing reactive nitrogen sources to passivate carbon
surfaces;24 another strategy is carbonization
and activation of N-containing precursors.25 N-containing compounds are used as precursors to synthesize NPCs,
thereby improving its electrochemical performance, for example, polyaspartic
acid,26ortho-aminophenol/formaldehyde
resin,27 polypyrrole,28 polyacrylonitrile,29 and so
forth. Zhou et al.30 used m-aminophenol formaldehyde resin as a carbon and N source to obtain
N-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials through precarbonization
and KOH activation. When applied as a supercapacitor electrode material,
it exhibited good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance
of 271.5 F g–1 under 0.2 A g–1 and a high specific capacitance retention of 94.1% after 10 000
cycles. Wang et al.31 synthesized activated
mesoporous carbons (AMCs) by using KOH to activate phenolic-resin-based
carbon. By changing the mass ratio of KOH/carbon, AMCs with 1118 m2 g–1 of specific area could be obtained,
and in 1 M H2SO4, it showed a high specific
capacitance of 260 F g–1 under 1 A g–1 and the capacitance was 163 F g–1 under 20 A g–1., and furthermore, the capacitance did not decrease
after 10 000 cycles at 2 A g–1.

In
this paper, an effective strategy was introduced to prepare NPCs.
It involved two processes, precarbonization of the resin and an activation
reaction process. By adjusting the activation temperature, the amount
of activator, and the activated carbon, NPCs with abundant micropores
were successfully synthesized. The highest specific capacitance of
341 F g–1 under 1 A g–1 was achieved
in 6 M KOH. Furthermore, the electrode maintained a capacitance of
92% after 5000 cycles, which was conducted at a high current density
of 10 A g–1. Symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor
of NPCs-2-700 had a significant energy density as well as functional
density, and the results of light-emitting diode (LED) bulb illuminated
by two series-connected symmetric solid-state supercapacitors showed
the potential of the electrode materials in actual application. The
low cost and excellent performance of the electrode materials may
be further advantageous for supercapacitors and have potential applications
on other energy-storage devices.

2 Results and Discussion
The morphology and pore structure
of the obtained samples were studied using field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
as shown in Figure 1. SEM image (Figure 1a,b) showed that after activation with KOH at 700 °C, the structure
of AC-500 opened up, resulting in a rough surface and pore structures
of the carbon material. Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) mapping images of NPCs-2-700 are exhibited in Figure 1e, which indicate that numerous
N atoms were successfully in situ codoped in the carbon nanosheets.
High-resolution TEM showed that the sheet had abundant micropores,
and the amorphous microporous structure of samples could be clearly
observed in Figure 1c,d. An important factor with regard to the electrical conductivity
and surface wettability was the unique microporous structure of carbon
materials, which suggested their promising applications in supercapacitors.32

NPCs-2-700, (c,d) TEM images of NPCs-2-700, and (e) EDX mapping images
of NPCs-2-700.

Typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of NPCs-2-y ascertained the crystallographic structure
of the product, as shown in Figure 2a. These carbonization products all displayed two diffraction
peaks at 2θ around 25 and 44°, and it could be concluded
that these carbonized products all possessed a porous carbon (002)
crystal face as well as a (100) amorphous structure. Synchronously,
we observed a decrease in the intensity of the peak at 25° with
the increase of activation temperature; this could be ascribed to
the fact that the structures of the graphitized samples were severely
damaged at high temperatures during activation.30

adsorption/desorption
isotherms, and (d) corresponding pore size distributions of NPCs-2-600,
NPCs-2-700, and NPCs-2-800.

The specific nature could be further elucidated by
Raman spectroscopy. The curves of Raman spectroscopic analysis in Figure 2b indicated two characteristic
broad peaks of the NPCs corresponding to the disordered carbon structures
(D-band) and graphitic layer structures (G-band) at 1337 and 1595
cm–1, respectively. The degree of graphitization
was expressed by the ID/IG ratio; the higher the ID/IG ratio, the larger the defect of the
structure.33 The values of ID/IG were 0.94, 0.97, and
1.04 for NPCs-2-600, NPCs-2-700, and NPCs-2-800, respectively, proving
that the graphitization degree decreased with the increase of temperature.
Besides, the results were consistent with the observation from XRD.

The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms along with the
corresponding pore size distribution for the three samples of the
NPCs are shown in Figure 2c,d. Obviously, in Figure 2c, NPCs-2-600, NPCs-2-700, and NPCs-2-800 underwent
micropore filling under a relatively low pressure (P/P0 < 0.2), and the amount of gas
adsorption increased sharply. Subsequently, a horizontal or near-horizontal
curve appeared, indicating that the micropores were totally full of
N2, with little or no further adsorption occurring, and
their curves showed the characteristics of type I adsorption isotherm.
The pore size distribution curve in Figure 2d further confirmed the micropore property.
When the activation temperature increased, the specific surface area
and the total pore volume of the NPCs increased first and then decreased;
when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 700 °C, the specific
surface area and the total pore volume of the NPCs increased from
373 m2 g–1, 0.21 cm3 g–1 to 2248 m2 g–1, 4.57
cm3 g–1. However, the specific surface
area and total pore volume at 800 °C were 1815 m2 g–1 and 1.14 cm3 g–1, which
might be due to the collapse of pores during carbonization.34 In addition, more detailed pore parameters obtained
from the N2 adsorption isotherm are given in Table 1.

The surface element
content and the chemical bond changes of NPCs were obtained using
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Three peaks of C, N, and O
could be found in all of the spectrum in Figure 3a as a result of successful incorporation
of N. In addition, as shown in Figure 3b–d, the N 1s spectrum could be divided into
three separated peaks centered at 397.81, 399.72, and 401.06 eV, which
were referred to pyridine-N (N-6), pyrrolic/pyridinic-N (N-5), and
quaternary-N (N-Q), respectively. The strength of these peaks varied
with the activation temperature, indicating that the contents of N-6,
N-5, and N-Q also changed with temperature. The N contents of samples
NPCs-2-600, NPCs-2-700, and NPCs-2-800 were 6.69, 2.18, and 1.07%,
respectively, implying that the N content gradually decreased with
the increasing activation temperature. The various relative contents
of different N corresponded to the ratio of the fitted peak areas
(Table 2). According
to the data in Table 2, the relative contents of the elements were more significantly affected
by temperature. The N-6 and N-5 contents in all samples were more
than 70% of the total N atoms; furthermore, N-6 and N-5 could contribute
a significant additional pseudocapacitance of the material because
they were deemed to be electrochemically active in alkaline solution,
and it was vital for increasing the capacitance of NPCs.35 It is worth noting that the contents of N-5
and N-6 accounted for 83.9% of the total N of NPCs-2-700, contributing
to the better capacitance performance.

The electrochemical capability
study of NPCs for supercapacitors was carried out on a three-electrode
system by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge
(GCD) tests as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
in 6 M KOH. The CV curves of NPC electrodes at a scanning speed of
20 mV/s and a voltage range of −0.8 to −0.2 V are shown
in Figure 4a; all CVs
showed a regular rectangle, indicating that NPCs had an ideal double
capacitance behavior. In general, the capacitance of a capacitor was
measured by comparing the area of the CV curve within the same potential
window. As shown in Figure 4a, NPCs-2-700 had the largest CV curve area, implying that
its capacitance was the largest of all samples; identical conclusions
were obtained from the results of GCD of NPCs in Figure 4b, and the discharge time of
NPCs-2-700 was the longest. Specifically, using formula 1, the maximum capacitance of NPCs-2-700 at
1 A g–1 was calculated to be 341 F g–1, which was higher than most of the reported NPCs (Table S1). In addition, the capacitance values of NPCs-2-600,
NPCs-2-800, NPCs-1-700, and NPCs-3-700 were 252, 236, 312—, and 314 F g–1, respectively. The CVs of NPCs-2-700
under different sweep speeds (10–100 mV/s) are revealed in Figure 4c. It could be observed
in the curves that the current of NPCs-2-700 increased with the increase
of the sweep speed. Moreover, all CV curves showed similar rectangular
shapes, indicating that NPCs-2-700 had excellent capacitance characteristics.36 As shown in Figure 4d, the GCD curves of NPCs-2-700 were obtained
at 1–10 A g–1. Excitingly, even at high current
densities, all curves maintained a good isosceles triangle shape.
This result was consistent with the CV test results and demonstrated
that NPCs-2-700 possessed ideal supercapacitor behavior and excellent
electrochemical reversibility. According to formula 1, the Cm values
of NPCs-2-700 were 341, 146, 93, 54, and 25.5 F g–1 at a current density of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 A g–1, respectively. When the current density increased, the capacitance
reduced significantly; the reason may be that interfacial electrolytes
adsorbed a great deal of electrolyte ions, and consequently, the concentration
of the electrolyte ion at the interface decreased rapidly and the
polarization increased.37 Moreover, as
can be seen from Figure 4e, the GCD cycle stability of NPCs-2-700 was studied at 10 A g–1, and the capacitance remained at almost 92% after
5000 cycles, which showed no significant capacity loss, indicating
that NPCs-2-700 had outstanding cycle stability as an electrode material.

plots of NPCs-2-600, NPCs-2-700, and NPCs-2-800.

The EIS of the NPCs were obtained in the frequency range from 100
to 0.01 kHz, and this analysis could provide an insight into the resistance
and capacitance behavior of the symmetrical supercapacitor. The semicircle
in the high-frequency range and the vertical line in the low-frequency
range of the Nyquist curves indicate the capacitive performance of
the material.38Figure 4f shows the EIS diagram of NPCs-2-600, NPCs-2-700,
and NPCs-2-800 porous carbon materials tested at open circuit potential.
Among the three curves, the semicircle diameter of the NPCs-2-700
curve was the smallest in the high-frequency region, and additionally,
the oblique line of the NPCs-2-700 curve was closest to the vertical
axis in the low-frequency region, indicating that the contact resistance
of NPCs-2-700 was the lowest and the electrical conductivity was excellent.
This was supported by the CV and GCD test results.

For the purpose
of satisfying the actual application, it is necessary to further explore
the performance of these samples in symmetric solid-state supercapacitors.
A symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor based on NPCs-2-700 was assembled
(denoted as NPCs-2-700//NPCs-2-700). It can be seen from Figure 5a that in different
potential windows (between 1.0 and 1.5 V), the CV curves of the NPCs-2-700//NPCs-2-700
at 30 mV/s showed a quasi-rectangular shape. When the potential window
reached 1.4 V, the curve shape remained unchanged, indicating that
the solid-state supercapacitor exhibited an outstanding capacitive
behavior and fast charge/discharge characteristics. Nevertheless,
when the potential window reached 1.5 V, the electrode current increased
sharply, and the shape of the curve changed significantly because
the polarization of the electrode material at a high potential decomposed
the electrolyte. Therefore, the potential window of the device was
chosen between 0 and 1.4 V (Figure 5b), and all CVs showed almost typical rectangular shapes
under different scan rates, even under 100 mV/s, which imply that
it owned excellent rate capability and double-layer capacitance effect.
The result could be attributed to the high porosity and N content,
which are beneficial to the rapid diffusion as well as conversion
of electrolyte ions. With constant current charging, symmetric capacitors
were tested for charge and discharge at various current densities. Figure 5c shows the GCD curves
at different current densities (1–10 A g–1). All curves showed the typical shape of a symmetrical triangle,
which was typical of double-layer capacitors. Calculated by formula 2, we obtained specific
capacitances of 98.70, 45.39, 28.59, 15.58, 8.81, and 6.39 F g–1 for current densities of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 A
g–1. Moreover, Figure 5d presents the Ragone plots for NPCs-2-700//NPCs-2-700,
which imply the correlation between energy density (E, W h kg–1) and power density (P, W kg–1). E and P for symmetric NPCs-2-700//NPCs-2-700
were calculated from he formulas 3 and 4. The results showed that the
energy density of the symmetric supercapacitor changed from 9.60 W
h kg–1 at 1 A g–1 to 6.21 W h
kg–1 at 10 A g–1 with the increase
of current density, and the power density varied from 350.15 W kg–1 at 1 A g–1 to 3349.59 W kg–1 at 10 A g–1, and the retention
of E is 64.7%, which is higher than the value reported
in previous literature based on carbon material as the symmetric supercapacitor
electrode.30,39−42 What is more, as shown
in Figure 5e, because
of the excellent capacitive performance, the two charged symmetric
solid-state supercapacitors could power one LED for more than 60 s.

3 Conclusions
In
conclusion, carbon-based material has attracted a lot of interest
in supercapacitor electrodes, and we successfully synthesized NPCs
with a porous structure by carbonizing melamine–urea–formaldehyde
resins and KOH activation, possessing a large specific surface area
(2248 m2 g–1) along with a narrow pore
size distribution. The obtained NPCs showed a high charge-storage
capacity in the three-electrode system, and NPCs-2-700 had a specific
capacitance of 341 F g–1 under 1 A g–1 and also exhibited outstanding cycle stability (remain almost 92%
specific capacitance). Moreover, the assembled symmetric capacitor
NPCs-2-700//NPCs-2-700 possessed the highest energy density of 9.6
W h kg–1 under 1 A g–1, and the
power density was 350.15 W kg–1. Increasing N content
and micropore volume are the key to improving the performance of electrode
materials. These results offer new possibilities for developing high-performance
supercapacitor electrode materials and can also be explored in other
electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of NPCs
As shown in Scheme 1, the NPCs were synthesized
by utilizing melamine–urea–formaldehyde resins as the
carbon and nitrogen source and KOH as the activator. The synthetic
steps of the resins were as follows: 4.8 g of urea, 13.01 g of formaldehyde
aqueous solution (37%), and 30 mL of deionized water were added to
a three-necked flask and fully dissolved by ultrasonication; then,
triethanolamine was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 8.5–9.5.
The solution was then magnetically stirred in a 70 °C water bath,
and 3.4 g of melamine was added. The reaction was carried out for
3 h. Finally, the solution was allowed to stand, naturally cooled,
suction filtered, and washed with deionized water. The obtained sample
was dried at 85 °C in vacuum for 24 h to obtain dried resins.
The dried resins were carbonized at 550 °C for 2 h under a N2 condition, and the activated carbon obtained by carbonizing
at 550 °C (AC-550) was ground into a powder for use.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Schematic of NPCs
In
the KOH activation, AC-550 and KOH (the weight ratios of KOH and AC-550
are 3, 2, and 1) were added to an appropriate amount of ethanol solution
The mixture was thoroughly mixed under magnetic stirring and then
dried at 65 °C for over 24 h. The obtained dry mixture was activated
at 600, 700, and 800 °C under a N2 atmosphere with
a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 for 2 h. The resulting
NPCs were removed of impurities with 1 M HCl and washed with deionized
water at room temperature, and then the powder was dried in a vacuum
oven to give the final NPCs. The final samples were abbreviated as
NPCs-x-y (the mass ratio of KOH
to AC-550 is represented by x; x = 1, 2, and 3; the temperature of activation is represented by y; y = 600, 700, and 800).

4.2 Electrochemical Tests
To gain more insight into the electrochemical performance of the
NPCs, the electrochemical tests were implemented in a three-electrode
system under ambient condition and were conducted in an electrochemical
working station (CHI760E). The Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the
counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The preparation
method of the working electrode (WE) was as follows:43 NPCs (80 wt %), acetylene black (10 wt %), polyvinylidene
difluoride (10 wt %), and appropriate amount of ethanol were completely
ground by a mortar, and the mixture was pasted evenly on a 1 ×
1 cm nickel foam. Then, the nickel foam was compacted under a pressure
of 10 MPa and dried overnight at 60 °C. The CV tests of NPCs
were investigated at different scanning rates between −0.8
and −0.2 V. GCD tests were performed between 1 and 10 A g–1. EIS tests of NPCs were performed at an open circuit
voltage between 100 kHz and 10 mHz, and the amplitude of ac voltage
was 5 mV. From the GCD tests, the specific capacitance of samples
in the three-electrode system could be calculated according to the
following formula44 1  where I (A) is the
discharge current, Δt (s) is discharge time, m (g) is the mass of the NPCs, and ΔV (V)is the discharge voltage. In a symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor,
the mass of the active material on two WEs was the same. The two electrodes
were immersed in poly(vinyl alcohol)/KOH, and a diaphragm was placed
between the two WEs to assemble a symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor.
The electrochemical properties of the NPC electrode material were
evaluated by CV and GCD, and the specific capacitance of the individual
electrode was obtained by the following formula44 2  where the discharge current, discharge
time, and total mass of NPCs on the two electrodes and the voltage
window are represented by I (A), Δt (s), m (g), and ΔV (V),
respectively. Energy density (E, W h kg–1) was calculated by the following formula44 3  where Cs (F g–1) is the specific capacitance of a single electrode in the two-electrode
system and V (V) is the operating voltage. Power
density (P, W kg–1) was received
from the equation44 4  where t (s) is the discharge time.
