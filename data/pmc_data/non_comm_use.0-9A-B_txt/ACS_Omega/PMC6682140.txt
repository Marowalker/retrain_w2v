Synchronized motion between two self-running
oil droplets floating
on an aqueous phase is reported. We describe the results of our observation
on the interference between a pair of centimeter-sized nitrobenzene
droplets undergoing back-and-forth motion on a waterway. The two droplets
exhibit a swinging type of synchronization when a thin glass capillary
is placed at the midpoint of the waterway with a narrow rectangle
shape. Furthermore, 2:1 synchronized oscillation of the periodicities
of this back-and-forth motion is generated when the capillary is shifted
away from the center of the waterway. We discuss the mechanism of
the emergence of synchronized swinging motion for the pair of droplets
based on a simple mathematical model with nonlinear coupled differential
equations.

Introduction
Living organisms maintain
their lives through the dissipation of
chemical energy under isothermal conditions. Through a long evolutionary
process, organisms have developed a “technique” to generate
macroscopic motion by diminishing the effects of large fluctuations,
Brownian motion, inherent to individual molecular components with
a length scale of nanometer, i.e., motor proteins. On the other hand,
humans are adapting the approach by using rigid bodies to obtain macroscopic
mechanical motion by suppressing fluctuation to achieve energy transduction.
The realization of self-regulated macroscopic motion using chemical
energy with a nonrigid body under mild conditions is a long-standing
target of research and still remains an interesting subject. Recently,
numerous studies have been undertaken to generate self-propelled motion
on a macroscopic scale driven by thermodynamic nonequilibrium,1−4 including chemical reactions,5−9 transfer of a chemical substance,10−29 temperature gradient,30−33 photoirradiation,34−38 external vibration,39 stationary
electrical potential,40 and so on. These
studies have revealed that various kinds of regular motions can be
generated by the introduction of symmetry breakage in the experimental
system in terms of either the shape of the objects or on the environmental
boundary conditions.1 In an experimental
system with active droplets, fluctuation of the interface, or interfacial
instability, due to the Marangoni effect has been proposed to cause
specific macroscopic motions. It has been reported that irregular
agitation induced by a chemical Marangoni effect can be transduced
into characteristic repetitive up–down or rotational motion,
simply by choosing appropriate boundary conditions.10,26,41,42 For example,
Sumino et al.10 found that an oil droplet
exhibits a rhythmic back-and-forth (reciprocating) motion under geometrical
constraint with a narrow rectangle shape, whereas it undergoes random
motion in an isotropic environment.

In the present study, we
performed an experiment on the interference
between a pair of active droplets undergoing back-and-forth the motion
on a waterway with a narrow rectangle shape. The droplets exhibit
a swinging type of synchronization when a glass capillary is placed
at the midpoint of the waterway.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the experimental system, where a pair of droplets of nitrobenzene
(density: 1.2 g/cm3) with the same volume (100 μL)
are situated on an aqueous phase using a pipette. In our experiments,
all of the chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. All of the experiments were carried
out at room temperature (24 ± 2 °C). It has been found that
heavy oil droplet, such as nitrobenzene and aniline, can float on
aqueous solution by avoiding sinking to the bottom because of the
supporting effect of the interfacial tension and tends to exhibit
active self-propelled motion driven by Marangoni instability.10,26,41,42 Before the investigation on the interference of the self-propelled
motion of the couple of droplets, we have explored the effect of chemical
compositions of the aqueous phase on the self-propelled motion; for
example, we have explored the effect of chemical compositions of the
aqueous phase on the self-propelled motion by adding various chemical
species, such as sodium chloride, sucrose, quinine chloride, and acetic
acid, at different concentrations. As the result, we found that the
self-propelled motion of a nitrobenzene droplet becomes most vivid
when submolar concentration of acetic acid is added to the aqueous
solution. Thus, in the present study, we adapted acetic acid solution
to observe the spontaneous motion of oil droplets and confirmed that
a regular back-and-forth reciprocating motion is generated in a reproducible
manner. To observe the interference between the droplets undergoing
back-and-forth motion, we placed a glass capillary (ϕ = 1.8
mm for the part dipped into the waterway) at the middle of the waterway,
as depicted in Figure 1a. In the absence of a glass capillary on the waterway, the droplets
tend to merge together to form a single droplet through the collision.
With a capillary, the twin droplets remain each other on the left
and right chambers without fusion and exhibit a back-and-forth motion. Figure 1b shows images of
the droplets taken at 1 s intervals, revealing that the droplets exhibit
a swinging-type synchronization.

Figure 1 Pair of oil droplets exhibiting self-propelled
motion on an aqueous
phase in a narrow rectangular vessel. (a) Experimental setup: Two
droplets of nitrobenzene (each 100 μL) were situated on an aqueous
phase of 0.3 mol/L acetic acid. A pipette was inserted at the midpoint
of the waterway. The droplets began to exhibit translational motion
immediately after contact with the aqueous solution. (b) Upper image:
Side view of the experimental setup. Lower image: Snapshots of the
swinging droplets at 1 s intervals.

Figure 2 shows
the
spatiotemporal diagrams for the droplet motion. As shown in Figure 2a1, the droplets
undergo 1:1 swinging-type synchronization, where a narrow pipette
(ϕ = 1.8 mm) was put at the middle of the waterway in the experiments
as depicted in Figure 1. When the intervening narrow pipette was replaced by a thick glass
rod (ϕ = 5.0 mm), the droplets exhibit unsynchronized motion.
It is noted that replacement of the interference barrier of the narrow
pipette by the glass rod with a wider diameter causes the coupling
strength between the self-moving droplets to be weaker. The difference
in the interference mode of coupled motion can be depicted as a phase
diagram, as shown in Figure 2a2,c2. For a 1:1 synchronized motion, the trajectory shows
a regular loop along a straight line with a slope of unity (Figure 2a2). Figure 2c1 shows the spatiotemporal
diagram when the intervening pipette was positioned on the right-hand
side of the waterway, revealing the appearance of a 2:1 synchronization
of the back-and-forth motion. Recently, we have reported the up–down
self-propelled motion for a floating oil droplet by prohibiting translational
motion using a thin glass rod.43 It was
found that a pair of neighboring droplets undergo an in-phase synchronization.
Such an experimental trend was argued in terms of the Marangoni effect
under gravitational instability for a heavy oil droplet. The mode
of the synchronization of the swinging-type motion in the present
study is regarded to correspond to the in-phase synchronization of
the up–down motion of the two droplets.

a pipette with the diameter of 1.8 mm is inserted at the midpoint

between the motions of the left and right droplets, X1 and X2, respectively. For
all of the experiments, the volume of the droplets was 100 μL
and the aqueous phase was 0.3 mol/L acetic acid solution, using the
waterway shown in Figure 1a.

To clarify the mechanism that
underlies the synchronized motion
of the two droplets, we performed a numerical study based on a simple
theoretical model. We adopted a model for self-propelled directional
motion on a quasi-one-dimensional waterway, as in a previous study10 1  where m denotes the mass
of the droplet, η is the viscosity of water, and α is
the ratio between the driving force and viscous damping. In our modeling,
we omitted the noise term used in the previous study10 to abstract the essential quality of the self-propelled
motion through simplification of the differential equation. Equation 1 implies that the
self-propelled motion is a phenomenon generated under thermodynamically
open conditions, i.e., competition between the driving force and viscous
damping.

Next, we consider the motion of the droplets on the
left-hand and
right-hand sides of the waterway by using dimensionless positional
variables, x1 and x2, corresponding to the left and right droplets, respectively 2  where μ1 and μ2 are the parameters that determine the period
of back-and-forth
motion, and they are set to ca. 0.35. The value of α is set
to 0.26. The variables of x1 and x2 are defined as negative and positive, respectively.
Thus, the differential equations on x1 and x2 in eq 2 are symmetric with respect to each other.
The second term on the right-hand side of eq 2 represents the interaction between the two
droplets. Here, we simply assumed that the interaction between two
droplets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
them;42 thus, the interaction is effective
only when the distance between them is short and tends to induce an
in-phase motion. The last term of eq 2 represents the boundary effect, or potential energy
of the vessel wall and barrier of the inserted capillary or rod. We
chose these values to reproduce the stable translational motion of
the droplets. 3  The potential energy U is
schematically depicted in Figure 3a2–c2, where we consider the repulsive effect
due to the meniscus near the glass wall and inserted pipette/rod.
We adopted the parameters for the boundary effect, k = 80, a = 0.25, b = 6.75, to roughly
reproduce the geometry of the meniscus around the hydrophilic glass
wall. Figure 3a1,b1
shows the results of the numerical simulation when the waterway is
divided at the midpoint. To check for the appearance of the synchronized
state, μ1 and μ2 are set to be somewhat
different: μ1 = 0.36, μ2 = 0.32. Figure 3a1 shows a 1:1 synchronization,
corresponding to the experiment in Figure 2a1, with the interaction parameter γ
= 0.4. On the other hand, Figure 3b1 shows the unsynchronized state, where the interaction
parameter is smaller γ = 0.1. Figure 3c1 shows the appearance of 2:1 synchronization,
where the waterway is divided 2:1, suggesting a reproduction of the
experimental trend in Figure 3c2. Except for the placement of the barrier, the parameters
for 2:1 synchronization are the same as those for 1:1 synchronization.
In our simple model equations, the important spatial variables were
not included such as size and morphology of the droplets and the width
and depth of the waterways. It is noted that, through such very simple
mathematical modeling, the essential features on the behavior of a
pair of the self-propelled droplets have been well reproduced.

with eq 2; the values
of the parameters are given in the text. (a1) 1:1 Synchronization
when the strength of the interaction parameter is γ = 0.4 at
the middle of the waterway. (b1) Out of synchronization when the strength
of interaction is smaller γ = 0.1. (c1) 2:1 Synchronization
when the intervening barrier is shifted to give a 2:1 ratio for the
respective lengths of the waterway under conditions similar to those
in (a2). The result of numerical simulation for t = [0,100], where the time step is 0.01. (a2–c2) The profiles
of the potential function U, where x1,x2 = 0 corresponds to the
position of the glass pipette or rod, and the edges on the left and
right correspond to the position of the walls of the vessel. Around
the vicinity of the boundary, we considered the effect of the meniscus
as explained in the text. (a3–c3) Correlation diagram of between
the left and right droplets denoted as x1 and x2, respectively.

In summary, we have clarified that the synchronized
swinging motion
of a pair of droplets is generated in a spontaneous manner. When we
vary the relative length of the waterway as a control parameter, the
mode of synchronization changes from 1:1 to 2:1. It may be interesting
to extend the experiments to produce other types of synchronized motion,
such as mode coupling with more than two droplets and the interaction
of different-sized droplets. These studies are expected to contribute
to the development of a system that exhibits self-organized motion
working driven by chemical nonequilibrium under isothermal condition.
