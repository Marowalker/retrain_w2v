A molecular Ni(II)–NNN
pincer complex (1) exhibited
unprecedented reversible single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation
and color change upon heating and cooling due to a subtle change in
the N–Ni(II) bond length and ligand conformation. UV–vis,
thermogravimetric, differential scanning calorimetry, single-crystal
structural data, temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction, and
Raman and computational studies supported the structural change of
the Ni(II) complex with temperature.

Introduction
Smart materials that
exhibit modulation in physical properties
such as color, fluorescence, and magnetic and electronic properties
with respect to external stimuli have received significant attention
in recent years due to their potential applications ranging from biology
to materials science.1 In particular, temperature-induced
color-changing (thermochromic) materials have found applications in
thermochromic coatings, smart dyes, switches, security markers, thermal
warning, medical strips, and sensors.2 Among
the thermochromic materials, inorganic materials are having additional advantages
such as good thermal stability and durability in extensive range of
temperatures over organic materials, though latter provide synthetic
versatility. Inorganic semiconducting oxides (V2O5, PbO, and TiO2) and mixed-metal halides exhibited reversible
thermochromism.3 Inorganic salts such as
copper(I) iodide, ammonium metavanadate, and manganese violet have
shown irreversible phase transition and color change with temperature.4 Thermochromic behavior of inorganic materials
is attributed to the change of coordination geometry, guest absorption/desorption,
bond breakage/formation dynamic structural change, strength, charge
transfer, and mode of coordinating ligand.5,6 For
instance, yttrium-iron garnet, Y3Fe5O12, displayed reversible thermochromic properties due to a temperature-induced
red shift of the O2––Fe3+ ligand-to-metal
charge-transfer band.7 Thermal expansion
of axial Cu–O bonds in the 3d–4f hetero-bimetallic complex,
Ho2Cu(TeO3)2(SO4)2, with temperature exhibited reversible thermochromism.8 Single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformation
via dehydration and rehydration of the mixed-metal complex, [Co2(ppca)2(H2O)(V4O12)0.5], exhibited reversible thermochromism between red
and brown.9 Fu and co-workers have reported
low-temperature thermochromism in various iodometallate-based inorganic–organic
hybrids.10 Inorganic–organic hybrids,
{(MV)2[Pb7Br18]}n, exhibited thermoswitchable conductance intervened via
thermochromism-controlled electron transfer.11 Metal–organic hybrids based on polyhalobismuthate, [Dim]2[Bi2X10] (X = Cl, Br, and I), revealed
photoluminescence with long emission lifetime as well as reversible
thermochromism in a solid state.12 The
alteration of coordination equilibrium with temperature in ionic-liquid-based
cationic nickel(II) complexes leads to color change from blue-green
to orange.13 Temperature-induced reversible
phase transition and coordination geometry have been observed in the
nickel(II)–isopropylamine complex.14 Thus, thermochromism in Ni(II) complexes was mostly caused by the
change in coordination number and coordination geometry.15,16 However, the mechanism of color change of nickel(II) complexes (metal–organic
materials) at different temperatures has not been well understood
and also scarcely reported. Hence, nickel(II) complexes that retain
their single-crystalline character after color change could provide
structural evidence for thermochromism and its relevant mechanism.
Herein, we report a series of nickel(II)–NNN pincer complexes
(1–4) that exhibited reversible thermochromism.
Complex 1 showed octahedral coordination geometry of
Ni(II). Temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and
Raman spectra of 1 suggested a clear structural change
at 140 °C that contributed for thermochromism. Significantly,
the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of 1 shows
that it maintains its same single-crystal structure before and after
heating. The structurally similar Ni(II)–NNN pincer complexes
of 2–4 also exhibited reversible
thermochromism.

Results and Discussion
The reaction
of the tridentate pincer ligand Py–NNN (L1–L4) with NiCl2·6H2O in methanol
at room temperature (RT) produced nickel–NNN
pincer complexes (1–4) in good yield
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Nickel(II)–NNN Pincer Complexes (1–4)
Slow diffusion of
diethyl ether vapor into methanol solution of 1 produced
light green crystals (Figure 1). Interestingly, green crystals converted
into purple upon heating at 150 °C (1B). Although
it was slow, the purple crystals were reversed to green completely
upon cooling to room temperature in a duration of 5 h. The complex 1 was melted at 235 °C and produced a dull sand-colored
powder material upon cooling to room temperature. However, recrystallization
of the sand-colored powder from methanol produced pale green crystals
(1D). Heating of 1D at 150 °C showed
a color change from pale green to purple, whereas cooling produced
a color change from purple to green slowly, which perfectly matched
with 1. Thus, complex 1 exhibited clear
reversible thermochromism between green and purple upon heating and
cooling (Figure 1).
Further clear color switching of 1 without significant
decomposition indicated its good thermal stability.

Figure 1 Reversible thermochromic
behavior and SCSC transformation of complex 1.

Single-crystal analysis of 1 showed monoclinic space
group P21/n (Table S1). Nickel(II) center adopted a distorted octahedral
coordination geometry with three-nitrogen coordination from the Py–NNN
ligand and oxygen coordination from water and two chloride ions (Figure 2a). In complex 1, the bond lengths of Ni(1)–N(1), Ni(1)–N(2),
and Ni(1)–N(1) are 1.9945(14), 2.3520(14), and 2.3709(15)Å,
respectively, and Ni(1)–Cl(1), Ni(1)–Cl(2), and Ni(1)–O(3)
bond lengths are 2.4266(5), 2.3979(5), and 2.0260(14) Å, respectively.
The bond angles in N(1)–Ni(1)–O(3), N(2)–Ni(1)–N(3),
and Cl(2)–Ni(1)–Cl(1) are 178.67(6), 154.37(5), and
172.230(17)°, respectively (Table S2). The coordinated water molecule formed intermolecular H-bonding
interaction with Cl of another complex and produced a dimeric structure
that was further stabilized by other weak H-bonding interactions between
morpholine oxygen and hydrogen. The relevant O–H···Cl
and C–H···O hydrogen bonding distances are 2.275
and 2.919(1) Å, respectively, and hydrogen bond angles in O(3)–H(2)···Cl(1)
and C(2)–H(2A)···O(2) are 161.80(1) and 123.52(1)°,
respectively (Figure 3). Interestingly, the crystal of 1 when heated at 150
°C showed complete color change from green to purple (1B) as well as retained its single-crystalline character [SCSC transformation].
The digital image taken at room temperature undoubtedly confirmed
the color change from green to purple (Figure 2b). Hence, we expected that single-crystal
analysis of 1B would provide clear reason for color change
by heating. But structural analysis of 1B also revealed
the same monoclinic space group P21/n and almost indistinguishable structure from 1 (Table S3). Ni(II) center displayed distorted
octahedral geometry with three-nitrogen coordination from the pincer
ligand, one water molecule, and two chloride ions (Figure 2b). A closer look of the 1B structure revealed only a very slight conformational change
in the morpholine ring and orientation of chloride ions. It is noted
that 1 showed thermochromism at 150 °C but single-crystal
analysis was performed at room temperature. Thus, contrary to our
expectation, the structure reversed to the initial state while cooling
though the crystal retain purple color.

The purple crystal (1B) slowly converted back to a
green crystal (1C) upon cooling for a longer time (Figure 1). The structure
of 1C also perfectly matched with 1 and 1B. Similarly, structural analysis of pale green single crystals
(1D) also revealed the same structure of 1 (Table S8). A comparison of the Ni–N
and Ni–O bond lengths of 1, 1B, 1C, and 1D showed insignificant variation in
bond lengths (Figure S1, Tables S2, S4, S6, and S8); all four structures showed a similar dimeric structure
via H-bonding between coordinated water and chloride ions (Figure 3 and Table 1).

Overall
single-crystal analysis of 1, 1B, 1C, and 1D divulged only structural integrity
of 1 upon heating/cooling/melting, which confirmed that
there is no water/chlorine breakage from the coordination sphere.
However, it also did not provide any clear structural evidence to
explain thermochromism. To gain insight into structural-change-induced
thermochromism, we have performed temperature-dependent PXRD (Figure 4a). Interestingly,
the PXRD pattern of 1 did not show any pattern change
up to 140 °C, but exhibited a clear change of PXRD pattern when
heating at 160 °C. This clearly indicates that 1 undergoes a structural change upon heating at above 140 °C
that causes the color change. The PXRD pattern of the cooled crystals
perfectly matched with 1, which confirmed structural
reversibility (Figure 4b). However, the exact structural change of 1 at higher
temperature could not be obtained at this time. To verify that the
bond stretching frequency variation occurs with temperature, we have
performed Raman spectral studies (Figure S2). The Raman spectrum of 1 recorded at room temperature
showed intense peaks, whereas decrease of peak intensity and disappearance
of some peaks were observed at 150 °C. It is noted that Raman
spectra did not show a significant change up to 140 °C. Thus,
Raman studies also supported the phase change of 1 upon
heating at above 140 °C temperature. The differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) studies of 1 showed a clear phase transition
at 146 °C before melting at 235 °C (Figure S3). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 indicated no loss of coordinated water or chloride ions upon heating
up to 150°C (Figure S4).

PXRD patterns of 1. (b)

the sample cooled from 160 °C to room temperature (blue).

Electron spin resonance (EPR)
studies of 1 and 1B did not show a significant
change in the structures except
a slightly strong peak between 900 and 1200 gauss (Figure S6). Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) studies did
not show a significant change in the peak position and suggest that 1 did not undergo any structural change chemically after heating
(Figure S7). The electronic spectrum of
complex 1 was recorded in the solid state to understand
the color change (Figure 5). Absorption spectra of 1 clearly showed differences
before and after heating in the longer wavelength range (Figure 5). Before heating, 1 showed ligand-based π–π* transitions
at 261 and 312 nm, whereas the ligand-to-metal (L → M) charge-transfer
transition was observed at 413 nm. The absorption at 706 nm could
be assigned to the d–d transition.15

Figure 5 Solid-state
UV–vis absorption spectra of 1 and 1B.

The ligand-centered transitions
did not show significant change
after heating. However, 1B exhibited a red-shifted L
→ M charge-transfer transition and blue-shifted d–d
transition and appeared as a broad band between 460 and 580 nm.

Thus, absorption spectra of 1 clearly evidenced the
color change before and after heating and supported thermochromism.
The heating and cooling thermochromic cycle of 1 has
also been performed four times to confirm the stability and reversibility
(Figure S8). Further, to investigate the
influence of side arms of nickel complexes on thermochromic behavior,
Ni(II) complexes with a different substituent (piperidine, piperazine,
and methylpiperazine) instead of morpholine have been synthesized
to evaluate the structural robustness on thermochromism (2–4).

Interestingly, the complexes 2 and 3 exhibited
clear reversible thermochromism upon heating and cooling of solids
(Figure 6). In contrast,
heating of complex 4 at 90 °C resulted in melting,
affording a brown liquid, which upon cooling to room temperature turned
green without solidification. Significantly, the green compound showed
reversible thermochromic behavior. Upon heating the green liquid at
90 °C, it turned brown, and upon cooling, the green color was
retained (Figure 6).
Thus, by keeping the coordination element constant, different substituents
on the side arms of the pincer ligand could alter the thermochromism
of nickel complexes. Unfortunately, our efforts to grow single crystals
of 2–4 were futile and hence solid-state
structural studies for 2–4 could
not be performed. However, the structures of 2–4 were confirmed using mass and FTIR spectroscopy studies.

the complexes by means of temperature.

Conclusions
The simple Ni(II)–NNN pincer complex
showed reversible thermochromism
in the solid state upon heating and cooling due to reversible structural
change. Temperature-dependent PXRD and Raman studies supported the
structural change of 1 at higher temperature. TGA and
DSC studies indicated that the compound 1 did not undergo
any decomposition or lose of coordinated ligands. However, only the
structure determination at higher temperature can provide a clear
mechanism of thermochromism.
