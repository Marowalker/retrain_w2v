The hybrids of M(en)3Ag2I4 (M
= Zn or Ni) are isostructural to each other and crystallize in space
group P6322 with quite similar lattice
parameters. The hybrid solid solutions ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1) have been prepared via self-assembly in
the mixed N,N-dimethylformamide
solution of AgNO3, KI, and ethylenediamine, meanwhile,
with certain relative amount of [Zn(en)3]2+ and
[Ni(en)3]2+ ions at ambient condition. All hybrid
solid solutions are isostructural to the parent hybrids M(en)3Ag2I4 (M = Zn or Ni). The UV–vis–near
IR diffuse reflection spectra in solid state, thermogravimetric analysis,
variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility, and dielectrics have
been investigated for ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α <
1). The intensity of bands centered at 540 and 860 nm in UV–vis–near
IR spectra, arising from the d–d electron transition in Ni2+ ion, as well as the Curie constant decreases linearly with
the molar fraction of Zn (α)/Ni (1 – α), whereas
the c-axis length, the C–N and C–C
bond lengths in the ethylenediamine, the frequency-independent dielectric
permittivity and the onset temperature of dielectric relaxation, and
so forth show nonmonotonical alternation with the fraction of Zn (α)/Ni
(1 – α) in the solid solution, and the origin for these
differences is further discussed.

Introduction
Solid solutions are
a class of unique materials. Generally, a solid
solution not only preserves the important properties of its components
but also in some cases, imparts synergistic properties to its components;
for example, the well-known “bronze”, one of the first
solid solutions made by humans and composed of the metals tin and
copper, is much stronger and harder than either of its components
and was an extremely useful material to the ancients.

It is
an efficient strategy to improve the performance and modulate
the desirable nature of a functional material via making into a solid
solution. For example, the nanocrystals (NCs) of cesium lead halide
perovskites (CsPbX3 with X = Cl, Br, and I) have recently
became a topic of extensive research,1−8 and among them, the CsPbBr3 NCs show photoluminescence
quantum yields which are close to 100%9,10 and a wide
range of applications.2−5,11 Regarding the CsPbBr3 NCs, the cubic phase of CsPbI3 NCs is more attractive
for tunable lasers, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells owing to
the lower band gap (1.73 eV) and larger exciton Bohr radius (6 nm
for CsPbI3 with respect to 3.5 nm for CsPbBr3), but they are significantly less stable, and a phase transition
occurs from cubic to orthorhombic phase of CsPbI3 below
315 °C.12,13 The band gap of orthorhombic
phase CsPbI3 (2.25 eV) is larger than that of cubic phase
CsPbI3 (1.73 eV); moreover, the orthorhombic phase CsPbI3 shows indirect band gap; these disadvantages make it less
suitable for many optoelectronic applications. The cubic phase CsPbI3 is stabilizable in both NCs and thin films via forming solid
solution, namely, by partially replacing I– ions
in CsPbI3 with Br– or Cl– ions.12,14−17 In the study of organic solar
cells, Zhang and co-workers found that a ternary solar cell, where
two types of miscible donor molecules form solid solution to result
in enhancement of hole mobility and abatement of charge recombination,
shows higher cell efficiency than the corresponding binary solar cell
with only one type of donor molecule.18

In hybrid ferroelectric material area, most recently, a series
of A-site perovskite solid solutions, with a formula of [(NH2NH3)x(CH3NH3)1–x][Mn(HCOO)3] (x = 1.00–0.67), were successfully synthesized
and the ferroelectricity was investigated; the study revealed that
with x value decreasing from 1.00 to 0.67, the critical
temperature TC is lowered; meanwhile,
the transition from paraelectric to ferroelectric phase becomes more
diffuse in the dielectric spectroscopy because of the A-site [NH2NH3]+ substituted by [CH3NH3]+ leading to decrease of the framework
distortion and the polarization in the ferroelectric phase of solid
solution, and this finding opens a new line of research into these
MOF-based materials.19

In the study
of molecule magnet, Ren et al. found that two spin-Peierls
compounds, [Cl-BzPy][Ni(mnt)2]20 and [Cl-BzPy][Pt(mnt)2]21 (Cl-BzPy+ = 4′-chlorobenzyl-1-pyridinium and mnt2– = maleonitriledithiolate), show isomorphic and quite similar lattice
parameters but distinct temperature of spin-Peierls transition, with TC ≈ 275 K in [Cl-BzPy][Pt(mnt)2] versus 106 K in [Cl-BzPy][Ni(mnt)2], and then they achieved
the solid solutions of [Cl-BzPy][NixPt1–x(mnt)2] with x = 0.09–0.91 via mixing the acetonitrile solution
at a certain molar ratio of [Cl-BzPy][Ni(mnt)2] to [Cl-BzPy][Pt(mnt)2] and crystallizing at ambient temperature. Interestingly,
the spin-Peierls transition temperature, TC, is precisely tunable from 106 to 275 K in this solid solution family
of [Cl-BzPy][NixPt1–x(mnt)2] (x = 0.09–0.91).22

Recently, Jiang et al. reported two new
iodoargentate framework
hybrids of M(en)3Ag2I4 (M = Zn and
Ni) with the tridymite topology.23 The
further studies disclosed that those two iodoargentate frameworks
display distinct optical24 and electrochemical
DNA recognition25 behaviors. Hybrid Zn(en)3Ag2I4 shows intense ultraviolet light
absorbance, whereas Ni(en)3Ag2I4,
besides the intense absorbance within the ultraviolet region being
similar to that in Zn(en)3Ag2I4,
displays two additional intense absorption bands, centered at 540
and 860 nm, in the visible and near infrared regions, respectively.
Given that the hybrids M(en)3Ag2I4 (M = Zn and Ni) are isomorphic, moreover, possess rather similar
cell parameters; it is possible to harvest the hybrid solid solutions
of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4. Herein, we present the study of the
preparation strategy for ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 via in situ self-assembly
process in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) and the investigation for the Zn/Ni relative content dependence
of structural, magnetic, optical, and dielectric properties of hybrid
solid solutions ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1).

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
The solvents and chemicals,
such as DMF, ethylenediamine (en), KI, AgNO3, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co. Ltd. of China, which are of analysis pure grade, and used
as received without further purification.

Sample Preparation
Polycrystalline samples of Ni(en)3Ag2I4 and Zn(en)3Ag2I4 were achieved
using the published method23,24,26 and labeled as ZnNi-I and ZnNi-VII,
respectively.

Each polycrystalline sample of solid solution
was prepared using the same process, which is also similar to the
preparation for Ni(en)3Ag2I4 and
Zn(en)3Ag2I4. The difference in the
process of preparing each solid solution sample only concerns the
relative content of Zn2+ to Ni2+ ions in the
starting DMF solution containing Zn(NO3)2 and
Ni(NO3)2. In the starting DMF solution, the
total concentration of Zn2+ and Ni2+ ions was
maintained at 0.15 mol L–1 and the molar ratio of
Zn(NO3)2 and Ni(NO3)2 is x/(1 – x) for each solid solution
sample (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9), and the
corresponding solid solution sample is labeled as ZnNi-II, ZnNi-III,
ZnNi-IV, ZnNi-V, and ZnNi-VI, respectively.

Chemical and Physical Characterizations
Elemental analyses
(for C, H, and N) were performed with an Elementar vario EL III analytical
instrument. The molar fraction, α/1 – α, of Zn/Ni
in each molecular solid solution sample was determined using a Sciex
ELAN inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. The magnetic susceptibility
measurement was carried out using Quantum Design (SQUID) MPMS-5S magnetometers,
with the magnetic field of 5 kOe within a temperature range from 2
to 300 K. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with Rigaku
TG-DTA 8120 in flowing N2 with a heating rate of 10 K/min.
UV–vis–near IR diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded
by Shimadzu UV 3101PC. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected
on a Bruker D8 diffractometer at ambient temperature, operated at
40 kV and 40 mA, with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å),
and the measurement was performed in the 2θ range of 5°–50°
with 0.01°/step. The variable-temperature PXRD measurements were
performed using a Shimadzu XRD-6100 diffractometer, operated at 40
kV and 40 mA, with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
The diffraction angle 2θ ranges from 5 to 50° with a scan
rate of 0.01°/step. During the measurements, the heating or cooling
rate of temperature is ±10 K·min–1 and
the sample was kept at the set temperature for 15 min to ensure that
the sample and probe have the same temperature.

The temperature-dependent
ac dielectric permittivity was measured on a concept 80 system (Novocontrol,
Germany); each powdered polycrystalline pellet, with 7 mm in diameter,
was made under the static pressure of 6 MPa pressure. The pellet thicknesses
are 0.49 mm (54 mg) for Ni(en)3Ag2I4 (ZnNi-I), 0.47 mm (52 mg) for ZnNi-II, 0.47 mm (53 mg) for ZnNi-III,
0.44 mm (50 mg) for ZnNi-I, 0.46 mm (52 mg) for ZnNi-V, 0.43 mm (47
mg) for ZnNi-VI, and 0.49 mm (54 mg) for Zn(en)3Ag2I4 (ZnNi-VII). The pellet was sandwiched by two
copper electrodes with gold during the dielectric measurement. The
ac frequency spans from 1 to 107 Hz, and the temperatures
range from 173 to 453 K for ZnNi-I to V and from 173 to 438 K for
ZnNi-VI and ZnNi-VII.

X-ray Crystallography
Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction
data were collected for the selected single crystals using a Bruker
diffractometer-SMART-APEX II with a charge-coupled device and D8-QUEST
with a CMOS area detector. Both employed graphite-monochromated Mo
Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data reduction and
absorption corrections were performed using the SAINT27 and SADABS28 software packages,
respectively. The structures were solved by the direct methods using
SHELXS-2014.29 The nonhydrogen atoms were
anisotropically refined using a full-matrix least-squares method on F2. All hydrogen atoms were placed at the calculated
positions and refined as riding on the parent atoms. In the crystal
structure of each hybrid solid solution ZnNi-x (x = II–VI), the Zn2+ and Ni2+ ions distribute randomly at the Wyckoff position 2b to form a solid
solution and the occupied factor of site was determined based on the
analysis of the relative content of Zn to Ni, which was achieved by
ICP measurements for each sample of ZnNi-x (x = II–VI). The pretreatment of these hybrids for
ICP measurement is dissolved in the samples with concentrated nitric
acid. The details of data collection, structure refinement, and crystallography
are summarized in Table S1. Further details
can be obtained from the cifs deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre and can be obtained free of charge on request via http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. The CCDC reference numbers range from 1580489 to 1580494 and 1584776.

Results and Discussion
Characterization for the Composition
The molar fraction
of Zn/Ni was determined for each polycrystalline sample of ZnNi-x (x = II–VI) using the ICP technique,
and the results are summarized in Table 1. It is found that the molar fraction of
Zn/Ni in the final polycrystalline product is rather close to that
in the starting material for the preparation of each hybrid solid
solution, and the final polycrystalline sample corresponds to a formula
of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 with α = 0 for ZnNi-I, 0.1 for
ZnNi-II, 0.31 for ZnNi-III, 0.49 for ZnNi-IV, 0.7 for ZnNi-V, 0.89
for ZnNi-VI, and 1 for ZnNi-VII. These results demonstrate that Zn
can be substituted by Ni at an arbitrary molar ratio in the hybrid
Zn(en)3Ag2I4 to form a solid solution
and vice versa. This conclusion is further supported by the single-crystal
structure analysis.

The microanalysis for C, H, and N
elements was also performed for
this series of hybrids, and the theoretically calculated values for
C, H, and N elements were gained on the formula ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4, where the α value was obtained from ICP measurement
for each sample of ZnNi-x (x = I–VII).
The contents of C, H, and N elements found together with calculated
on the formula ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 are summarized in Table 2 for each sample of ZnNi-x (x = I–VII), and they are coincided
with each other.

Crystal Structure
The crystal structures of ZnNi-I
and ZnNi-VII were previously reported to be isomorphic with space
group P63.23 However, to check the published cifs of both ZnNi-I and ZnNi-VII
using the PLATON program30 indicates that
their space group should be P6322. In
this study, the crystal structures of ZnNi-x (x = I–VII) were determined at ambient temperature,
revealing that they are isomorphic to each other and crystallize in
space group P6322 with rather analogous
lattice parameters. Thus, only the crystal structure of ZnNi-VII is
described in detail.

There are one silver ions, two distinct
I ions, one zinc ions, and half of an ethylenediamine molecule contained
within an asymmetric unit of ZnNi-VII, as shown in Figure 1a. The Zn1 ion locates at the
special crystallographic site, the Wyckoff position 2b, with a threefold
rotational axis passing through. In addition, there are three ethylenediamine
molecules coordinated to that zinc ion forming a bivalence cation.
The coordinated ethylenediamine molecule possesses a C2 point with the twofold rotational axis passing through
the midpoint and Zn1. All of these symmetry operations make the bivalence
cation, [Zn(en)3]2+, possessing the D3 point group symmetry (ref. Figure 1b which was viewed along threefold
rotational axis). The Ag1 is coordinated with four iodine ions I forming
a tetrahedral coordination sphere, [AgI4]3–, which has a symmetry with C3 point
group (ref. Figure 1c and viewed along threefold rotational axis). The threefold rotational
axis passes through I2 and Ag1 ions in the coordination tetrahedron.
Both I1 and I2 ions act as the μ2-bridged ligands
and the I2 ion connecting two neighboring Ag+ ions arrange
in a linear fashion, whereas the I1 ion linking two neighboring Ag+ ions adopt in a nonlinear manner with bond angle ∠Ag1–I1–Ag1
of 143.62(3)° in ZnNi-VII. In addition, the bond length is 2.194(7)
Å for Zn–N, 2.8556(4) for Ag1–I1, and 2.8829(15)
Å for Ag1–I2 in ZnNi-VII, and these values are comparable
to those in the literature.23

unit with nonhydrogen atom labeling with 50% probability
thermal ellipsoids, (b) Zn(en)32+ coordination
octahedron, and (c) [AgI4]3– coordination
tetrahedron viewed along threefold axis in ZnNi-VII.

As for the hexagonal screw axis along c-axis and
twofold axis along a-/b-axis, the
[AgI4]3– coordinated tetrahedrons connected
with each other by sharing vertex forming a helical inorganic anionic
open framework [Ag2I4]n2n– and forming two types
of hexagonal channels along the c-axis and a-/b-axis, shown as in Figure 2a,b. The charge-balanced cations
[Zn(en)3]2+ are fulfilled within the channels.
The nearest Zn···Zn distance is 7.2194(4) and 9.0542(3)
Å along the c-axis and a-/b-axis, respectively. Only weak van der Waals interactions
are found between the inorganic framework and [Zn(en)3]2+ coordinated octahedral guests.

along (a) c-axis and (b) a-axis
directions in ZnNi-VII. These show the open framework
with hexagonal channels formed by [AgI4]3– tetrahedra and [Zn(en)3]2+ fulfilled within
the channels.

Unit Cell Parameters and
Bond Lengths
The plots of
normalized lattice parameters, a, c, and V, versus the molar fraction (α) of
Zn in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 are shown in Figure 3a for ZnNi-x (x = I–VII), indicating that the a-/b-axis length and the cell volume increase monotonically
with α increasing, whereas the plot of the c-axis length versus the molar fraction (α) of Zn in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 displays a double-peak shape and two peaks locate
at ca. α = 0.31 and 0.7. As the molar fraction α of Zn
in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 changes from 0 to 1, the c-axis length and the cell volume increase by 0.4 and 1.2%, respectively.

Figure 3 Plots
of the normalized (a) cell parameters and (b) band lengths
of M–N, C–N, C–C, Ag–I1, Ag–I2,
and bond angles of ∠I2–Ag–I1 and ∠I1–Ag–I1
against the molar fraction of Zn (α) in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4.

The bond lengths of M–N,
C–N in the [M(en)3]2+, as well as Ag–I1
and Ag–I2 are plotted
against the molar fraction (α) of Zn in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4, which is depicted in Figure 3b for ZnNi-x (x =
I–VII). The bond length of M–N almost linearly increases
with the molar fraction (α) of Zn in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4, and this observation is in good agreement with the fact that the
Zn2+ ion radius (0.74 Å) is larger than the Ni2+ ion radius (0.69 Å).31 The
bond lengths of both Ag–I1 and Ag–I2 in the inorganic
framework are almost independent on the change of the molar fraction
(α) of Zn in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 for ZnNi-x (x = I–VII). However, the bond lengths of
N–C and C–C in the ethylenediamine molecule change irregularly.

Magnetic Susceptibility
Because the Ni2+ ion
shows paramagnetism, the variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility
was measured in the temperature range of 1.8–300 K for the
polycrystalline samples of ZnNi-x (x = I–VI) and the corresponding plots of χm against T are depicted in Figures 4 and S3, where
the symbol χm denotes the molar magnetic susceptibility,
corresponding to per formula unit of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4. All samples of ZnNi-x (x = I–VI) display the Curie–Weiss-type
magnetic behavior in 1.8–300 K and that is understandable.

Figure 4 Plots
of variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility of ZnNi-x (x = I–VII) in different temperature/magnetic
susceptibility scales.

In the series of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4, the paramagnetism of
each sample contributes from the [Ni(en)3]2+ ions occupied in the channels of framework because the distances
between the neighboring [Ni(en)3]2+ are large
enough; for example, the nearest [Ni(en)3]2+ ions show the Ni···Ni distances of 9.002(2) Å
along a-/b-axis direction and 7.218(7)
Å along c-axis direction even if in the crystal
structure of ZnNi-I (Ni(en)3Ag2I4), the magnetic couplings between the neighboring [Ni(en)3]2+ is rather weak and each solid solution can be considered
as an isolated spin system. Accordingly, the magnetic susceptibility
data are fitted using eq 1 for each solid solution 1  

In eq 1, the symbols C and θ denote the Curie
constant and Weiss constant,
respectively, and the χm and χ0 represent
the molar magnetic susceptibility and the temperature-independent
paramagnetic susceptibility, respectively. The temperature-independent
paramagnetic susceptibility generally includes two parts, in which
the diamagnetism contributes from the atom core of molecules as well
as the possible temperature-independent van Vleck-type paramagnetism
originates from the coupling between the magnetic ground and excited
states through a magnetic field.32 The
best fits were performed for the magnetic susceptibility data of ZnNi-x (x = I–VI) in the range of 1.8–300
K, to give the parameters of C, θ, and χ0, which are summarized in Table S2. The Weiss constant (θ) obtained from the best fits of magnetic
susceptibility is so small for all samples of ZnNi-x (x = I–VI), indicating the existence of
almost absence of magnetic exchange interaction between the neighboring
paramagnetic [Ni(en)3]2+ ions. The Curie constant
decreases with the relative content of Ni2+ ions reducing
in ZnNi-x (x = I–VI). The
Curie constant C = 1.311 emu K mol–1 is obtained from magnetic susceptibility fit for ZnNi-I (Ni(en)3Ag2I4), which is slightly larger than
the spin-only value 1.0 emu K mol–1 for an S = 1 spin system owing to the existence of unquenched orbital
magnetic moments in Ni2+ ion with electronic configuration
d8. For other hybrids ZnNi-x (x = II–VI), the corresponding Curie constant Cx (x = II–VI) is theoretically
related to the C value of ZnNi-I (Ni(en)3Ag2I4) and the molar fraction of Ni2+ ion in ZnNi-x (x = II–VI)
according to eq 2 2  

In eq 2, the symbol
α is the molar fraction of Zn2+ ions in the hybrid
solid solution ZnNi-x (x = II–VI)
with a formula of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4. Therefore, the relative
content of Ni2+ in the hybrid solid solution ZnNi-x (x = II–VI) can be calculated
using the Curie constants and eq 2 and the corresponding α values are listed in Table S2, which are basically in agreement with
the corresponding results determined using the ICP technique.

UV–Vis–Near
IR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
The UV–vis–near
IR diffuse reflectance spectra of
ZnNi-x (x = I–VII) are displayed
in Figure 5a,b. Hybrid
ZnNi-VII (Zn(en)3Ag2I4) shows two
absorption bands in the wavelength ranges of 200–400 nm and
absence of any absorbance in the visible and near IR spectroscopy
regions (400–1200 nm); hybrid ZnNi-I (Ni(en)3Ag2I4) shows the absorption bands being rather similar
to ZnNi-VII in the ultraviolet light region, but possesses two additionally
intense absorption bands with a maximum at ca. 540 and 860 nm. The
absorption bands in the ultraviolet light region in ZnNi-I and ZnNi-VII
attribute to the electron transitions from the valence bands to conducting
bands within the {Ag2I42–}∞ inorganic framework. It is no doubt that the absorption
band centered at 860 nm is assigned to the d–d electron transition
within the Ni2+ ion, and the absorption band with a maximum
at 540 nm arises probably from the d–d electron transition
within the Ni2+ ion or the charge-transfer transition from
the donor of anionic framework to the acceptor of Ni2+ ions
in the UV–vis–near IR diffuse reflectance spectrum of
ZnNi-I.24,33 Other hybrid solid solutions, ZnNi-x (x = II–VI), show analogous UV–vis–near
IR diffuse reflectance spectra to ZnNi-I owing to the existence of
Ni2+ in the crystals, but the relative intensity of both
bands centered at 540 and 860 nm reduces with the molar fraction of
Ni reducing in the crystal (Figure 5b). The relative intensities of two bands in the visible
and near IR spectroscopy regions are plotted against the molar fraction
of Zn (α)/Ni (1 – α) for each hybrid solid solution
of ZnNi-x (x = II–VI), which
are displayed in Figure 5c,d, respectively, indicating good linear relationship, and this
is further confirmed by the linear fits with more than 0.99 adjusted
coefficient of determination for two plots.

Figure 5 (a,b) UV–vis–near
IR diffuse reflectance spectra
of ZnNi-x (x = I–VII) in
different wavelength ranges and plots of absorption band intensity
against the molar fraction, α, of Zn in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 for (c) 540 (d) 860 nm.

In a dilute solution, the light absorbance of a solute follows
the Beer–Lambert law, namely, the light absorbance of a solute
is proportional to its concentration. The good linear relationship
between the relative intensities of two bands at 540 and 860 nm and
the molar fraction of Ni in the solid solution demonstrate the Ni2+ ions homogeneously distribute in the lattice of each solid
solution; this conclusion is further supported by the single-crystal
structure analysis.

Although the UV spectra of ZnNi-x (x = I–VII) in the ultraviolet
light region of 200–400
nm show high similarity, the band edges exhibit obvious distinction
from each other. As illustrated in Figure 5a, the band edge shifts toward lower energy
side as the molar fraction of Zn (α) reduces in the hybrid solid
solution family of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4, namely, the energy band
gap of {Ag2I42–}∞ inorganic framework decreases with α reducing. This fact demonstrates
that the slight change of guest molecule geometry nature, such as
the molecular volume of guest, directly affects the bonding nature
of the {Ag2I42–}∞ inorganic framework.

Dielectrics
To remove the moisture
adsorbed on the
surface of sample pellet, prior to the measurement of dielectrics,
the pellet sandwiched by two copper electrodes covered gold was heated
to 383 K (110 °C) and then the measurements of dielectrics were
performed for two consecutive heating–cooling cycles. As shown
in Figures 6a and S5, the plots of dielectric permittivity (ε′)
versus temperature measured in two consecutive heating–cooling
cycles are almost the same for ZnNi-x (x = I–VII), indicating that the trace amount of moisture adsorbed
on the surface of sample pellet was completely eliminated.

Figure 6 Plots of dielectric
permittivity (ε′) vs temperature
of ZnNi-VII and the data obtained from (a) two consecutive heating–cooling
cycles at f = 104 Hz and (b) first cooling
process at the selected frequencies.

The temperature dependences of dielectric permittivity (ε′)
obtained from the first cooling process are displayed in Figures 6b and S6 for ZnNi-x (x = I–VII) at the selected frequencies. The dielectric spectra
of ZnNi-x (x = I–VII) show
common characteristics, namely, the ε′ value is independent
on the ac frequency in the lower temperature region, while increases
quickly with the temperature, which depends strongly on the ac frequency,
in the higher temperature region, indicating the existence of thermally
activated dielectric relaxation behavior in the higher temperature
region.34,35 For instance, as depicted in Figure 6b, ZnNi-VII shows a temperature-independent
dielectric permittivity at the temperature below ca. 373 K, which
value varies slowly from 11 to 11.7 as the temperature is elevated
from 173 to 373 K. The dielectric permittivity of ZnNi-VII depends
strongly on the ac frequency at the temperature above 373 K. The temperature,
where the thermally activated dielectric relaxation is clearly visible
in ε′–T plot, is defined as the
onset temperature (Tonset), which is summarized
in Table 3 together
with the ac frequency-independent dielectric permittivity (ε′)
and the corresponding temperature region for ZnNi-x (x = I–VII). It is worth noting that there
is no simple linear relationship between the frequency-independent
dielectric permittivity (ε′) and the molar fraction of
Zn/Ni in the ZnNi-x as well as between the Tonset and the molar fraction of Zn/Ni in the
ZnNi-x.

Relationship between Physical
Properties and Relative Content
of Zn/Ni
In the solid solutions of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1), there exists good linear relationship between
the intensity of bands centered at 540 and 860 nm as well as the Curie
constant and the molar fraction of Zn/Ni. This is because that the
bands centered at 540 and 860 nm arise from the d–d electron
transition in the Ni2+ ion and the magnetic susceptibility
also contributes from the Ni2+ ion. In the crystal structure
of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1), the distance
between the nearest neighboring Ni2+ ions is large enough
so that there is neglectable interaction between them, as a result,
the relationship between the intensity of d–d electron transition
band and the concentration of chromophore follows the Beer–Lambert
law, as well as the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility
obeys the Curie–Weiss law and the Curie constant is proportional
to the molar fraction of paramagnetic centers in solid solutions of
ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1).

On the other
hand, the lattice parameters, thermal stability (the characteristic
onset temperature of starting release of the coordinated ethylenediamine
molecules), the frequency-independent dielectric permittivity, and
the onset temperature of thermally activated dielectric relaxation
change nonmonotonically with the molar fraction of Zn/Ni in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1). As shown in Figure 3a,b, the nonmonotonic
alternation of cell parameters are related to the nonhomogeneous change
of C–N and C–C bond lengths in the guest [M(en)3]2+ ion.

In the guest [M(en)3]2+ ion, the bonds of
metal ion (Zn2+/Ni2+) with ethylenediamine molecules
are mainly governed by the electrostatic interaction; as displayed
in Figure 3b, the M–N
bond length increases linearly with the molar fraction of Zn (α)
in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1), indicating that
the bind energy of M–N in [M(en)3]2+ ion
decreases with increasing the molar fraction of Zn (α); accordingly,
the thermal stability of [M(en)3]2+ ion should
decrease with increasing the molar fraction of Zn (α) in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1), and this conclusion
is basically consistent with the alternation of the onset temperature
of losing ethylenediamine molecules of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1).

The electric polarizability is the
tendency to allow an externally
applied electric field to induce electric dipoles (separated positive
and negative charges) in a material. Polarization P is related to the applied electric field E by 3  where the symbols ε0 and
εr represent the permittivity of the free space and
the relative dielectric constant of a material. On the other hand,
the P is also the density of atomic-induce electric
dipole per unit volume 4  Therefore, 5  where p is the electric-induce
dipole moment and N is the density of dipoles. As
mentioned above, the εr of a material is relevant
to the electric-induce dipole moment, which depends on the crystal
structure. Consequently, both the nonmonotonic change of unit cell
volume and the electric-induce dipole moment in a unit cell give rise
to the nonmonotonic change of frequency-independent dielectric permittivity
and the onset temperature of thermally activated dielectric relaxation
in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1).

Conclusions
The hybrid solid solutions ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α <
1) have been prepared and characterized, and the crystal structures,
TGAs, the UV–vis–near IR diffuse reflection spectra
in solid state, variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility, and
dielectric properties have been investigated. The molar fraction of
Zn (α)/Ni (1 – α) in each hybrid solid solution
is rather close to the value calculated from the molar ratio of Zn/Ni
in the starting mixed solution for preparation of each solid solution.
The Zn2+ and Ni2+ form solid solution in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1) owing to two isostructural
parent hybrids having rather similar lattice parameters. The distance
is large enough between the neighboring Ni2+ ions in the
lattice of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1), leading
to the existence of neglectable electric and magnetic dipole interaction
as well as spin coupling in the lattice of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1); thus, the relationship between the intensity
of bands centered at 540 and 860 nm in UV–vis–near IR
spectra and the relative content of Zn/Ni shows dilute solution behavior,
as well as the solid solutions of ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α <
1) show magnetic feature of an isolated magnetic system. However,
the lattice parameters, the frequency-independent dielectric permittivity,
and the onset temperature of thermally activated dielectric relaxation
exhibit nonmonotonic change with the fraction of Zn/Ni in ZnαNi1−α(en)3Ag2I4 (0 < α < 1), attributing to the nonhomogeneous
alternation of N–C and C–C bond lengths in the [M(en)3]2+ guests and synergistic interaction. This study
provided an insight into understanding the correlation between the
given functionality and the relative content of components in hybrid
solid solution.
