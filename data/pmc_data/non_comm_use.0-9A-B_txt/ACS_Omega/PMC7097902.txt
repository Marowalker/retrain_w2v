In this study, the
waste silicon powder generated in the production of solar-grade polysilicon
scrap was used as the raw material, and silicon nitride (Si3N4) was directly efficient prepared by the microwave heating
nitridation. The temperature raising characteristics of silicon powder
by microwave heating and the influencing factors of the nitridation
reaction process were studied. The thermogravimetric analysis was
performed, and the temperature raising dielectric properties of silicon
powder were studied. The electromagnetic field and temperature
distributions of the microwave heating-induced silicon powder nitridation
process were simulated using COMSOL software. The nitridation reaction
of silicon powder induced by microwave heating has better temperature
raising characteristics: the average heating rate can reach 135 °C/min,
and the reaction time is significantly shortened (only 10–20
min). Microwave heating decreases the nitridation reaction temperature
by more than 100 °C and greatly shortens the reaction time. With
the increase of nitrogen pressure and reaction time, the nitridation
reaction is better. In addition, the conversion of the nitridation
reaction is more than 97%, and the products are mainly β-Si3N4 with the uniform and columnar morphology. Finally,
it is proved that the efficient recovery and utilization of industrial
waste silicon powder are realized, and there is lower energy consumption
by microwave heating technology.

1 Introduction
Solar
power
generation has the advantages of cleanliness, environmental protection,
safety, convenience, and abundant resources.1,2 However,
with the rapid development of solar power generation, the recycling
of a large amount of cutting waste generated during the preparation
of solar cells is a current research hotspot.3−6 Lin et al.4−6 recovered high-purity
silicon
powder by different methods from cutting waste. A new idea that uses
solar-grade polycrystalline silicon cutting waste to produce special
ceramics realized the comprehensive utilization of cutting waste and
increased the added value of the product. Si3N4 products are receiving more and more attention because of their
excellent physical and chemical properties, such as high-temperature
strength, thermal shock resistance, oxidation resistance, abrasion
resistance, and self-lubrication. These products have been used in
the manufacturing of high-temperature components of gas engines and
filters, high-temperature ceramic bearings, thermal insulators, corrosion-
and wear-resistant components in the chemical industry, and high-speed
cutting tools, with broad application prospects.7−9 Si3N4 powder is the
primary raw material of Si3N4 products; its
preparation is an essential topic of current research, which has been
widely considered.

At present, the preparation methods of silicon
nitride powder mainly include the direct nitridation method,10−12 the carbothermal reduction method,13−17 the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis
method,18 the chemical vapor deposition
method,19,20 the sol–gel method,21,22 and the silicon-imide thermal decomposition method.23 Wang et al.24 prepared Si3N4 powder with higher purity by preheating-assisted
combustion at low N2 pressures. Ye et al.25 prepared the yttrium aluminum garnet (Y3Al5O12) precursor-coated Si3N4 powder using the urea homogeneous preparation technique, in which
urea was used as a precipitant. Arik et al.26 synthesized Si3N4 from sepiolite by the carbothermal
reduction and nitridation process. Weimer et al.27 obtained α-Si3N4 powder from
pyrolyzed rice hulls by carbothermal nitridation. Zhou et al.28 successfully synthesized the well-crystallized
pure rod-shaped α-Si3N4 powder by carbothermal
reduction–nitridation. Huo et al.29 synthesized Si3N4 nanowires from a spent Fe–Si
catalyst. Wang and Wada30 used the carbothermal
reduction of silica to synthesize Si3N4 nanowires.
In order to obtain silicon nitride powders by conventional preparation
technology, high nitridation reaction temperatures, low heating rates,
and longer nitridation reaction times or high equipment conditions
are required, and the high production cost limits the widespread use
of Si3N4 ceramic materials. Therefore, some
new preparation techniques are being developed, including the discharge
plasma method31 and the microwave method.32,33 Among them, the microwave technology has attracted much attention
because of its advantages of fast and uniform heating, high efficiency,
and energy saving.34−38

In this
study, the preparation of silicon nitride from solar-grade waste silicon
powder by microwave heating and direct nitridation was studied. The
characteristics of microwave heating in the nitridation reaction of
silicon powder were investigated. The thermogravimetric and dielectric
properties of silicon powder were measured and analyzed, and the effects
of nitridation time and nitrogen pressure on the nitridation reaction
process were studied. The energy consumption of the nitridation reaction
was calculated. The electromagnetic field and temperature distributions
of the microwave heating-induced silicon powder nitridation process
were simulated using COMSOL software.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Thermogravimetric Analysis
To study the
nitridation and oxidation behavior of silicon powder before the experiment,
thermal analyses were carried out under nitrogen and oxygen, as shown
in Figure 1. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of silicon powder under the nitrogen atmosphere is
illustrated in Figure 1a. The temperature range of test was from 25 to 1500 °C, and
the heating rate was 10 °C/min. It can
be seen from the thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry
(DTG) curves in Figure 1a that the silicon powder exhibits a slight weight loss at lower
temperatures, which might have been caused by the evaporation of water
absorbed by the silicon powder. The mass is relatively stable with
the change of temperature, and the corresponding conversion rate of
the nitridation reaction of silicon powder undergoes little change.
This indicates that the temperature is the main factor limiting the
direct nitridation of silicon powder at this stage. When the temperature
is higher than 900 °C, it can be seen from the TG and DTG curves
that the quality of the silicon powder begins to increase slowly.
This indicates that the partial nitridation reaction of silicon powder
began, but the reaction rate did not increase significantly. When
the temperature reached 1350 °C, the mass change curve and the
mass change rate show a sudden increasing trend. The results indicate
that the silicon powder undergoes intense nitridation reaction to
form silicon nitride. With the temperature rising to around 1400 °C,
the rate of weight gain of the sample decreased rapidly, indicating
that the nitridation reaction had been basically completed.

Figure 1 TGA of silicon
powder
in different atmospheres: (a) nitrogen atmosphere and (b) oxygen atmosphere.

Figure 1b shows the
thermogravimetric behavior of silicon powder under the oxygen atmosphere.
The initial stage is the same as under the nitrogen atmosphere. Thereafter,
the phenomenon of slight weight loss occurs immediately. When the
temperature rises to 600 °C, it can be seen from the TG curve
that the quality of the silicon powder begins to increase slowly.
It indicates that part of silicon powder began to oxidize, but the
reaction rate was not significant. When the temperature was over 750
°C, the weight of the sample increased significantly, indicating
that the silica powder would undergo severe oxidation. It also indicates
that the oxidation temperature of the silicon powder is much lower
than the nitridation temperature. Therefore, the nitridation process
must be carried out in the absence of oxygen.

2.2 Determination
of Raw Material Dielectric Parameters
To study the microwave
absorption properties of silicon powder,
the dielectric parameters of silicon powder with different densities
during heating were measured. As illustrated in Figure 2, the test temperature range is from room
temperature to 1000 °C. Figure 2a–c presents the relative dielectric constant,
the relative dielectric loss factor, and the dielectric loss tangent,
respectively. Generally, the dielectric loss tangent is the main parameter
to show the absorption of microwave energy and its conversion into
thermal energy. As shown in Figure 2, the relative dielectric constant, the relative dielectric
loss factor, and the dielectric loss tangent of silicon powder range
from 1.0 to 6.0, 0.1 to 1.0, and 0.1 to 0.2, respectively. With the
increase of the test temperature below 600 °C, the relative dielectric
constant and the relative dielectric loss factor of the silicon powder
changed very slightly, and the dielectric loss tangent increased significantly.
This indicated that the silicon powder had excellent ability to absorb
microwaves, and could be heated by microwaves. When the temperature
increased from 600 to 800 °C, the relative dielectric constant
and the relative dielectric loss factor increased rapidly with the
increase of temperature. Then, with the continuous increase in temperature,
the trend remained unchanged or decreased. However, the dielectric
loss tangent increased rapidly after 600 °C, reached its maximum
at 750 °C, and then decreased rapidly. It can be seen from the
dielectric parameter test that the properties of the samples have
changed in the temperature range of 600–800 °C. This can
be proved by the rapid changes in the relative dielectric constant
and the relative dielectric loss factor. Since the dielectric testing
system is open, some silicon powder may be oxidized due to the increase
in temperature. Especially, when the temperature is higher than 750
°C,
the dielectric loss tangent decreases rapidly because of the severe
oxidation reaction of silicon powder. Therefore, the microwave absorption
capacity of the sample was reduced. In addition, the relative dielectric
constant and the relative dielectric loss factor increased with increasing
silicon powder density, while the dielectric loss tangent did not
change significantly below 600 °C. However, the dielectric loss
tangent of high-density silicon powder was more significant in the
temperature range of 600–750 °C. This may also indicate
that the oxidation rate of silicon powder decreases under dense conditions,
and it still has good microwave absorption ability until 750 °C.
These results were consistent with the TGA in the oxygen environment,
as illustrated in Figure 1b.

constant, (b) loss factor, and (c) loss tangent.

2.3 Temperature
Raising Characteristics of Microwave Heating during the Nitridation
Process of Silicon Powder
Figure 3 illustrates the heating curves of 100 g
of silicon powder under different microwave powers operated under
the nitrogen atmosphere. It can be seen from Figure 3 that microwave heating of silicon powder
has better temperature raising characteristics, and the heating rate
increases significantly with the increase of microwave power. First,
1350 °C was set as the target temperature of the experiment.
When the microwave power was 1500 W, it took 58 min to heat the silicon
powder to 1350 °C, and the average heating rate was only 23 °C/min.
When the microwave power was 2000 W, it took 30 min to rise to 1350
°C, and the average heating rate was about 45 °C/min. This
is consistent with the result of Xu et al.39 Furthermore, when the microwave power was 2500 W, the heating rate
of silicon powder increased rapidly, and the time to raise the temperature
to 1350 °C was only approximately 10 min. The above average heating
rate could reach 135 °C/min, while the heating rate of the conventional
heating method was 5–10 °C/min.40 Therefore, microwave heating is significantly faster than the traditional
heating methods, and it dramatically shortens the processing time.

rising and electromagnetic distribution heated by microwaves: (a)
temperature raising characteristics, (b) electromagnetic field distribution,
and (c) temperature distribution.

The process of nitridation reaction is a fast-changing dynamic
process. It is difficult to simulate and calculate the effect of silicon
nitride formation on the distribution of the microwave electromagnetic
field and the change in the heating process. Therefore, we only simulate
the temperature rise process of silicon powder. COMSOL software was
used to simulate the electromagnetic field and temperature distribution
in the nitridation process of microwave heating of silicon powder,
as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows
the actual heating curve and the simulated heating curve. The simulated
power is 2000 and 2500 W. It can be seen from the figure that the
actual heating curve and the simulated heating curve have a higher
degree of fit. When the temperature exceeds 850 °C, the actual
process begins to slow. This may be because the microwave absorption
property of the material becomes worse when silicon nitride is formed,
and the heating rate becomes slower. We have measured the dielectric
parameters of silicon nitride, and the results show that the microwave
absorption performance of silicon nitride powder is poor, which is
consistent with that reported in the literature.41 Furthermore, we have also carried out an experiment of
microwave heating of silicon nitride powder; the results are the same
as the dielectric test, which also shows that silicon nitride powder
is difficult to be directly heated by microwaves. Figure 3b shows the electromagnetic
field distribution. In microwave ovens, the electric and magnetic
fields are symmetrically distributed. Figure 3c shows a temperature distribution diagram.
The temperature is slightly higher on the surface than in the interior,
which is also consistent with the experimental results. In order to
solve the problem of uneven distribution of the electromagnetic field,
rotation was adopted to ensure uniform heating.

2.4 Effect of the Heating Method on
the Nitridation Process
Figure 4 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of samples under different nitridation reaction methods and of the
silicon powder raw material. The effects of conventional heating and
microwave heating on the nitridation reaction were studied. First,
the samples were heated to 1250 and 1350 °C by conventional heating
for a duration of 20 min. The N2 pressure was maintained
at around 121 kPa. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the XRD peak of the raw material corresponds
to the standard diffraction peak of silicon (PDF: 75-0589), and no
other impurity phase appears. This indicates that the purity of the
silicon powder was relatively high, and was consistent with the test
results of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Table 2). When the sample was heated
to 1250 °C by the conventional method for the nitridation reaction,
the XRD peak of the sample showed no significant change compared with
the silicon powder raw material. This indicates that there was no
obvious nitridation reaction of silicon powder. When the temperature
was raised to 1350 °C, the XRD pattern of the sample had an obvious
Si3N4 peak, but the peak intensity of the Si
phase was the highest. The residual silicon is about 12.1% analyzed
by XRD. This indicates that the conversion of nitridation reaction
was relatively lower, to be only about 81.24%, even though Si3N4 was generated when the conventional heating
was raised to 1350 °C. This may be affected by the diffusion
of nitrogen. Besides, the conventional heating for the nitridation
reaction was consistent with the results of TGA, which indicated that
a vigorous nitridation reaction occurred at 1350 °C, and was
substantially completed at 1450 °C. Moreover, it can be seen
from Figure 4 that
there are some peaks of Si2N2O phase due to
the oxidation of some Si powder. When a small amount of SiO2 is mixed in the Si powder, the Si2N2O substance
is easily formed during the nitridation process,42,43 and
the reaction equations are described below 1   2  

Figure 4 XRD pattern
of conventional heating, microwave
heating, and raw material samples.

In addition, the samples of the nitridation reaction heated
by microwaves were analyzed. The temperature of the nitridation reaction
was set to 1250 °C, and the microwave power was 2000 W. The nitrogen
pressure and the holding time were the same as traditional heating.
It can be seen from Figure 4 that when the temperature was raised to 1250 °C by microwave
heating, the silicon powder was almost completely nitridated. The
XRD pattern of the sample corresponded to the β-Si3N4 peak, and a small amount of α-Si3N4 phase and traces of the residual Si phase were observed.
The mass percentage of β-Si3N4, α-Si3N4, Si2N2O, and Si phases
was analyzed to be 93.2, 4.7, 0.7, and 1.4%, respectively. The sample
was mainly of the β-Si3N4 phase after
the nitridation reaction. Moreover, the conversion of nitridation
reaction can reach 97.69%. This indicates that the nitridation reaction
can be completed at a lower temperature and within a shorter time
by microwave heating, which has the advantages of rapid reaction rate
and high efficiency.

The energy consumption of the nitridation
process by conventional heating and microwave irradiation was calculated.
The energy consumption during the heating process and the reaction
process (holding stage) was calculated. The results are shown in Table 1. From the table,
we can see that with a microwave power of 2000 W (the conversion rate
of electrical energy to microwave energy is generally 0.7–0.8),
the energy required for heating to 1250 °C in 30 min and holding
for 20 min is about 1.8 kW·h. When using conventional heating,
the energy required for heating to 1250 °C at a heating rate
of 10 °C/min and holding for 20 min is about 15.8 kW·h,
and the energy required for heating to 1350 °C is about 17.7
kW·h. The energy consumption of the microwave heating process
is much lower than that of the conventional heating.

Nitridation

Figure 5 presents scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the raw material and silicon nitride
samples. Figure 5a
shows the raw material of silicon powder, and its morphology is mainly
silicon scrap. Figure 5b,c shows the nitridation products by conventional heating at 1250
and 1350 °C, respectively. Figure 5d shows the nitridation product by microwave heating
at 1250 °C. It can be seen from Figure 5b that when the powder is heated to 1250
°C by conventional heating, there is no significant change in
the shape of silica powder. The result indicates that the reaction
temperature was not reached, and no obvious nitridation reaction occurred,
which is consistent with the XRD analysis. When the temperature reached
1350 °C, the morphology of the sample changed, and larger silicon
nitride crystals were formed. However, there was still a large amount
of residual silicon powder without nitridation. This indicates that
although a part of the silicon powder had been nitridated, the conversion
rate of the reaction was lower. Furthermore, it can be seen from Figure 5d that the morphology
of the crumb-like silicon powder completely crystallized into larger-sized
particles at 1250 °C, and the size and the shape are relatively
uniform and mainly columnar. The result indicates that the nitridation
reaction by microwave heating was more efficient than traditional
heating. The nitridation temperature can be reduced by more than 100
°C by microwave heating, and the morphology of the reaction products
was more uniform.

microwave heating at 1250 °C.

2.5 Effect of the Reaction
Time on the Nitridation Process
Figure 6 illustrates the
XRD patterns of samples after different reaction times. The power
of the microwave was set to 2000 W, and the reaction temperatures
were set to 1250 °C for the holding times of 5, 10, and 20 min.
The N2 pressure was maintained at 121 kPa. It can be seen
from the XRD patterns that there are silicon phase, β-Si3N4 phase, α-Si3N4 phase,
and Si2N2O phase in the sample when it is held
at 1250 °C for only 5 min. This indicates that the nitridation
reaction of silicon powder was incomplete (the conversion is only
83.93%), and there were more residual silicon and intermediate phases.
When the holding time was 10 min, the XRD peak of the sample corresponded
well with β-Si3N4. The amounts of the
residual silicon phase and the α-Si3N4 phase were small. The conversion of the nitridation reaction reached
97.03%, indicating that the silicon powder had been basically nitridated
10 min after the reaction. When the holding time was extended to 20
min, the diffraction intensity of the silicon phase and the α-Si3N4 phase was further reduced or disappeared. The
product was mainly β-Si3N4, and only a
small amount of α-Si3N4 phase and silicon
phase remained. The nitridation reaction was completed with a conversion
of 97.69%. The conversion of nitridation reaction after different
reaction times is shown in Figure 7. The results indicate that the conversion of the nitridation
reaction increases with time, but the reaction is almost complete
after 10 min. Thus, the direct nitridation reaction by microwave heating
of silicon powder could achieve good results within 10–20 min.
Compared with other traditional processes, which usually take 1–5
h or longer, this method significantly shortens the process of the
nitridation reaction of silicon powder.13,14,26,27

after different reaction times.

rate after different reaction times.

Figure 8 shows the
SEM images of samples
at different holding times. In Figure 8a, the morphology of the sample is complex, with filamentous,
granular, and flocculent crystals at the temperature of 1250 °C
for 5 min. This indicates that the nitridation reaction is insufficient.
When the temperature was maintained for 10 min, the morphology of
the sample was relatively uniform, and mainly composed of columnar
crystals. However, the surface was flocculent and relatively rough,
and there were still a small number of filaments. When the temperature
was maintained for 20 min, the morphology of the sample was relatively
uniform, mainly composed of columnar crystals, and no filaments were
observed. This indicates that the silicon powder had completed the
nitridation reaction and formed a relatively uniform phase when the
temperature was held for 20 min. The SEM microstructures were consistent
with the phase analysis based on XRD.

2.6 Effect
of N2 Pressure on the Nitridation
Process
In addition, the effect of different N2 pressures on the nitridation reaction of silicon powder was investigated.
Wang24 et al. reported the preparation
of silicon nitride powder by combustion synthesis under a low N2 pressure of 140–200 kPa. In this study, the microwave
power was set to 2000 W, the temperature was raised to 1250 °C,
and kept for 20 min. The N2 pressure was set to 106, 111,
and 121 kPa. Figure 9 illustrates the XRD patterns of samples under different N2 pressure conditions. When the N2 pressures were 106 and
111 kPa, the diffraction intensity of the silicon phase and of α-Si3N4 was higher, indicating that there were more
silicon residues and α-Si3N4 formed by
nitridation reactions, and the nitridation reaction was incomplete.
In addition, more Si2N2O phases were formed,
which may be due to oxidation. The conversions of nitridation reaction
under the N2 pressures of 106 and 111 kPa were only 84.33
and 89.24%, respectively. As the N2 pressure increased
to 121 kPa, the diffraction intensities of the silicon phase and the
α-Si3N4 phase in the sample were significantly
reduced. The silicon powder was almost nitridated to form β-Si3N4, and only minimal amounts of α-Si3N4 and silicon phases were left, which meant that
the nitridation reaction was more thorough. The conversion of nitridation
reaction increases with N2 pressure, as shown in Figure 10. Therefore, this
study indicates that under the conditions of rapid nitridation of
silicon powder heated by microwaves, a suitable increase in the N2 pressure is beneficial to the nitridation reaction of silicon
powder. This may be due to the promotion of the diffusion of nitrogen
atoms inside the silicon crystal under pressure, which accelerates
the nitridation of silicon atoms. This result is consistent with the
study of Atkinson et al.44

Figure 9 XRD pattern
of samples at different N2 pressures.

rate at different
N2 pressures.

Figure 11 illustrates the
SEM images of samples under different N2 pressure conditions.
It can be seen from Figure 11 that when the N2 pressure is 106 kPa, a large
amount of silicon scrap is not nitridated, and the formed silicon
nitride particles have a sheet shape. When the N2 pressure
is 111 kPa, there is little silicon scrap left, and the silicon nitride
particles crystallize and grow. When the N2 pressure is
121 kPa, the nitridation reaction is better; there is no residual
silicon powder; and the uniform silicon nitride crystal is formed.

kPa.

2.7 Mechanism
of Nitridation
Process
Conventional heating is a slow heating process from
the outside to the inside, as shown in Figure 12a. The surface temperature of the sample
is relatively high and uniform, so the nitridation reaction is preferentially
performed and a uniform silicon nitride layer is formed, which will
block the diffusion of nitrogen and cause some resistance to further
nitridation. In addition, silicon nitride has good thermal insulation
properties, which will hinder further reaction of the internal silicon,
as shown in Figure 12c, so the nitridation reaction by traditional heating requires a
higher temperature, and the conversion rate is lower. Microwave heating
is achieved by in situ conversion of electromagnetic energy inside
the material. According to the distribution characteristics of the
electromagnetic field, microwave heating will lead to a hot spot distribution
inside the material. However, it is difficult to measure it in the
actual experiment because of the internal heating characteristics
of microwaves. Therefore, we
combined with the actual experiment the calculation and simulation
of the distribution characteristics of the electromagnetic field and
the related literature reports45−47 to explain the obtained results.
Moreover, while some
areas will rapidly heat, the adjacent areas will achieve rapid heating
through heat transfer, as shown in Figure 12b; this greatly shortens the heat transfer
distance, and hence microwave heating has a higher heating rate. Furthermore,
the temperature around the hot spot is too high resulting in local
overheating, and reaching the local nitridation reaction temperature.
Thus, the nitridation reaction of Si may occur in advance at the hot
spots, and the overall temperature of the material is not too high.
This will not form a completely wrapped silicon nitride layer, so
the diffusion of nitrogen and further reaction will not be hindered
(as Figure 12d). In
addition, microwaves can penetrate the silicon nitride layer on the
silicon surface and continue to heat the inner part. Therefore, microwave
heating can reduce the temperature of the silicon powder nitridation
reaction and improve the conversion efficiency of the nitridation
reaction.

3 Conclusions
In order
to realize the preparation of silicon nitride from the
industrial waste silicon powder by direct nitridation, the microwave
heating–nitridation technology was applied in this study. Microwave
heating of silicon powder has a higher heating rate, which significantly
shortened the nitridation reaction time, improved the preparation
efficiency of silicon nitride powder, and also greatly reduced the
energy consumption. Compared with traditional heating, microwave heating
can reduce the nitridation temperature of silicon powder by more than
100 °C. The conversion of the nitridation reaction is over 97%,
and the obtained sample is mainly β-Si3N4. Moreover, with the increase of the reaction time and nitrogen pressure,
the nitridation effect is better. When the nitridation reaction of
silicon powder by microwave heating was conducted at 1250 °C
for 20 min under the pressure of 121 kPa, excellent results were obtained
in this study. The obtained product was mainly β-Si3N4, and its morphology was uniform and columnar.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Processes
The solar-grade waste polysilicon powder was provided by RZL (ReneSola
Zhejiang Ltd.), which was produced during the cutting process of polysilicon
chips. The purity of silicon powder was more than 99.9%, which was
determined using a Shimadzu energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analyzer.
The composition and the content of raw materials are shown in Table 2. The average particle size of the silicon powder was around
74 μm, measured using a laser particle size distribution analyzer
(HYL-1076). N2 used in the experiment was industrially
pure. The silicon powder was placed in a corundum crucible; the corundum
crucible was then put in a thermal insulation barrel (polycrystalline
mullite fiber), and thermal insulation cotton (polycrystalline mullite
fiber) was filled between the thermal insulation barrel and the crucible.
Afterward, the thermal insulation barrel was placed in a microwave
high-temperature sintering furnace. The microwave instrument is a
multimode cavity instrument. After closing the door of the microwave
oven, the vacuum was pumped below 1 kPa, and then the oven was filled
with nitrogen. The process was repeated three times, and the nitrogen
gas was then continuously injected into the furnace chamber to ensure
that the pressure was maintained at 100–125 kPa. The sample
was heated by the microwaves at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. The schematic
of microwave nitridation is presented in Figure 13. To study the influence of microwaves on
the heating characteristics of silicon powder, the power of the microwave
oven was set to 1500, 2000, and 2500 W. When the temperature rose
to the set temperature (1150, 1250 and 1350 °C), it was kept
for 5–20 min. The nitridation reaction equation is given below 3

After cooling
to room temperature, the samples were taken out for analysis. During
the experiment, an infrared thermometer was used to measure the temperature.

4.2 Characterization Method
TGA data were collected
using a TG and DTG analyzer (STA 449 F3
Jupiter, Netzsch, Germany). The starting material (3.083 mg) was heated
from 25 to 1500 °C at 10 °C/min under an N2 atmosphere
(20 mL/min), and another starting material (3.543 mg) was heated from
25 to 1200 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min under an oxygen atmosphere
(20 mL/min). The temperature raising dielectric properties of samples
were measured by the cavity perturbation method. The process of measuring
the dielectric properties by the cavity perturbation method has been
described in our previous research.48 The
temperature range of the raw material test was from room temperature
to 1000 °C. The microscopic morphology and microstructure of
samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope (TESCAN
VEGA3 SBH, Czech). The phase transition of silicon powder during the
nitridation process was analyzed by XRD (PANalytical X’Pert3
Powder, the Netherlands), and XRD patterns were obtained using CuKα
radiation (λ = 1.54060 Å) at 40 kV, 40 mA, and a scan rate
of 8 °/min. The relative amounts of various phases in the samples
were determined according to the method reported by Gazzara and Messier.32,49 The conversion rate of Si is expressed as follows 4  where P is the conversion
rate; WSi0 is the content of
free Si; and WSi1 is the content
of compound Si.
