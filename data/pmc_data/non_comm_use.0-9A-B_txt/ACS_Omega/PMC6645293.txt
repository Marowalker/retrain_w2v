Nowadays,
the infection caused by the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) and countless different
types of bacterial infection cause the death of millions of people
worldwide. Thereby, several strategies have explored for the advancement
of better and active antimicrobial agents; one of these lies in the
form of two-dimensional carbon-based nanocomposites. Herein, we demonstrate
the synthesis of the graphene–polyindole (Gr@PIn) nanocomposite
and polyindole (PIn) and significantly enhance the proficiency against
MRSA strains which are immune to most antibiotics. The synthesized
Gr@PIn and PIn have been characterized by the various biophysical
techniques, especially X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy
[scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM)], Fourier transform infrared, Raman, UV–vis spectroscopy,
and thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopic investigations
unveiled the disintegration of bacterial cell wall upon interaction
with Gr@PIn. Significantly, the Gr@PIn found to be very potent in
the eradication of the MRSA strain with minimal toxicity to the mammalian
cells. Assessment of the antibacterial mechanism revealed that the
Gr@PIn adhered toward the bacterial surface, irreversibly interrupted
the membrane layer structure of the bacteria, eventually penetrated
cells, and efficiently impeded protein activity, which inherently
turns into bacterial apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, last, the synthesized
Gr@PIn efficiently treated the S. aureus-mediated experimental skin infection in BALB/c mice as well. This
work magnifies our comprehending antibacterial mechanism of nonmetallic
graphene-based PIn nanocomposite and provides the support to activity
anticipation.

Introduction
Bacterial contamination
will continue to provide a significant
threat to public health, notably with rising levels of antimicrobial
resistance in previous years. ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus
faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) are responsible for most of the hospital-possessed infections
and one of the principal threats to healthcare as the consequences
of their multidrug resistance.1 Therefore,
the pathogen in the ESKAPE group, particularly the methicillin-resistant S. aureus, has appropriately attracted interest over
the earlier years.2,3

The rapid development of
nanotechnology has designed numerous antimicrobial
nanomaterials in present years. Nowadays, polymer-based nanocomposites
have drawn the significant attention of researchers toward energy
storage and conversion, excellent surface area, excellent carrier
mobility, enhanced electrochemical activity, and useful mechanical
characteristics in the biomedical field.4

In addition to the characteristics mentioned earlier, polymers
can also show antimicrobial properties.4 Among the various polymers, polyindole (PIn) has attained a tremendous
attention in the past couple of years. Indole contains benzene and
pyrrole rings simultaneously; indeed, PIn might have the attributes
of both poly(para-phenylene) and polypyrrole.5 The advantages of PIn are the significant redox
activity, sufficient thermal reliability, and slow degradation rate
in comparability with those of polyaniline and polypyrrole.6 Some nanocomposites of polymers have reported
with metal oxides, metal nanoparticles, and graphene and carbon nanotubes
widely used in antimicrobial applications.7−11 A variety of materials such as carbon nanomaterials,
inorganic nanomaterials, and conjugated polymers have been explored
to synthesize antimicrobial agents.12−15 Among them, graphene, a 2D nanomaterial,
has also revealed various applications in different fields such as
energy storage, nanoelectronics, nanocatalysis, and antimicrobial
properties.16−19 Recently, among these applications, the biomedical potentiality
of graphene and its own functionalized derivatives have received much
more attention from a medicinal chemist for drug discovery.15 Heretofore, graphene-based nanomaterial, such
as graphene oxide (GO), reduced GO (RGO), graphene quantum dots, and
graphene-based nanocomposites, being implemented to biosensors, bioimaging,
drug delivery, and photothermal therapy.20,21 Also, they reveal in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity.20 Liu et al. proposed antimicrobial mechanism
for graphene-based nanomaterials, which include cellular trauma with
graphene nanomaterials, wrapping the bacteria and membrane disruption
through graphene nanosheets, and oxidative stress because of superoxide
anion generation with the approach of graphene nanocomposite, limiting
the metabolism of bacteria.22 Moreover,
the graphene-based nanocomposite in animal’s models in the
presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) pathogen would probably generate the in-depth
understanding of the antimicrobial activity of graphene-based nanocomposite.
Besides, in vivo models would also provide a possibility to investigate
potential toxicity of graphene-based nanocomposite.

In this
research work, we address the issues to establish the effect
of PIn polymer and graphene PIn nanocomposite (Gr1@PIn
and Gr3@PIn = Gr@PIn) on MRSA microbes. The motivation
of the current study was to develop a simple, excellent, economical,
and eco-friendly strategy for the synthesis of Gr@PIn nanocomposites
as excellent antibacterial agents. A series of PIn and graphene nanocomposite
(Gr@PIn) materials were synthesized through aqueous medium polymerization
method to disperse the modified graphene which reduced via eco-friendly
strategies throughout the PIn matrix. Gr@PIn nanocomposites for the
antimicrobial agent have the following advantages, most notably solubility,
inexpensive, adequate mechanical strength, eco-friendly, biocompatible,
and processability, for the application. The strategy in this research
work successfully verified that the chemical bonding of the PIn modified
on the graphene-based polymer matrix, and the π–π
interaction among the aromatic system of the modified graphene and
PIn might have them both drastically improve the dispersion of graphene
in conjugated PIn via eco-friendly aqueous polymerization. Because
of the graphene layers exhibiting high surface area, flexible nanoscale
films with high aspect ratios were dispersed in the polymer matrix;
this strategy might improve the antibacterial properties drastically.
The synthesized graphene-based nanocomposites characterized by using
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman,
UV, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and electron microscopy [scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)].

Additionally, we have discussed these considerations through systematically
exploring the contagious ability of methicillin-resistant bacteria
in the presence of Gr@PIn under in vitro conditions as well as in
vivo employing Balb/c model-based skin infection. Subsequently, treatment
with the Gr@PIn composite formulation, the invasive potency of MRSA
was reduced to 60% and further the electron microscopic studies showed
that Gr@PIn nanocomposite formulation can potentially damage the cell
wall of MRSA and successfully inhibit the biofilm formation and further
inhibit MRSA growth in a concentration-dependent manner.

Results and Discussion
PIn and
Gr@PIn Structural Characteristics
XRD technique
was used to analyze the structure and phase of the synthesized samples.
The XRD pattern of PIn, Gr1@PIn, and Gr3@PIn
is shown in Figure 1. Pristine PIn shows 2θ = 22.368 with a d spacing of 3.629
Å. As the RGO concentration increases in the PIn, a typical enhancement
in the gallery spacing of the synthesized PIn in Gr1@PIn
and Gr3@PIn, respectively, followed the ranging from 3.744
to 3.773 Å with a redshift in 2θ from 20.368° to 21.552°.
This enhancement within the gallery spacing of the synthesized PIn
in the respective RGO could anticipate to the lamination all over
the PIn (inset Figure 1 clearly showed). Moreover, PIn has depicted distinctive diffused
XRD spectra signifying their amorphous character and a broad peak
at 2θ between 20° and 30°, which reveals the presence
of weak π–π stacking between the RGO sheets attributable
to the creased and improperly ordered structure.23,24 Consequently, XRD data distinctly reveal the successful synthesis
of PIn, Gr1@PIn, and Gr3@PIn in this study.

Figure 1 XRD spectrum
of synthesized Gr1@PIn, Gr3@PIn,
and PIn (inset: XRD shift).

Furthermore, the morphology of the synthesized PIn, Gr1@PIn, and Gr3@PIn nanocomposites is determined
through
SEM and high-resolution (HR) TEM. As shown in Figure 2A–C, SEM images of PIn, Gr1@PIn, and Gr3@PIn were distinctly hierarchical microstructures
on the scale of 5 μm. In Figure 2A, the PIn consists of homogeneously distributed spheres.
As RGO concentration increases, the surface morphology continuously
modified is observed in the Gr1@PIn and Gr3@PIn
nanocomposite (Figure 2B,C) with hierarchical microstructure constructed from a framework
of graphene sheets, on which PIn is attached. Complimenting energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrum (EDAX) is revealed by the presence of C (carbon), N
(nitrogen), and O (oxygen) in Gr3@PIn nanocomposite. Additionally, Figure 2D shows that elemental
mapping analysis will offer an instantaneous elemental distribution
of the samples, which ensure the homogeneous distribution of C (carbon),
N (nitrogen), and O (oxygen) atoms in Gr@PIn nanocomposites. In addition
to that, PIn reveals the formation of a single-phase system with homogeneous
discrete nanoparticle regime, as shown in TEM images (Figure 3A–C). Because the RGO
was incorporated with the PIn at lower concentration (Gr1@PIn), the morphology of the nanocomposite exhibited lateral RGO
sheets looking similar to nanorods probably because of strong intrachain
interactions of indole units which favored the formation of lateral
RGO sheets. Furthermore, as the concentration of graphene increases
in the sample Gr3@PIn, RGO sheet is distinctly observed.
Moreover, the morphology of the PIn in the nanocomposite (Gr3@PIn) was a hollow nanosphere, which is confirmed by the sharp distinction
within the dark edge and the pallid center in the TEM images (Figure 3C). Moreover, synthesized
pristine RGO nanosheet at 100 nm scale TEM image was shown in Figure
S1 of the Supporting Information, which
apparently can be seen as in a crumbled-shape nanosheet. Herein, polymerization
of indole is taking place in the presence of RGO, and with the polymerization
of polymer, RGO covalently bonded with PIn. With a known constant
concentration of indole, the optimized quantity of Gr1@PIn
shown rod-shaped morphology. Increasing the quantity of RGO, that
is, Gr3@PIn cannot provide rod-shaped morphology in the
nanocomposite. As the optimal quantity of RGO is required through
the polymerization to attain rod-shaped morphology, the optimum quantity
might reduce the interfacial energy barrier between the solid surface
and bulk monomer solution, significant to the subsequent propagation
of the indole polymerization producing the RGO rod-shaped morphology.25 Furthermore, indolium ion is hydrophilic, unlike,
RGO functions as a hydrophobic group. Therefore, RGO and indolium
may yield micelles acting as a template to form the rod-shaped nanostructures.
Furthermore, at a low ratio of RGO–indolium (Gr1@PIn), the additional indolium ions may produce vesicles, which in
turn may develop toward a low curvature rod-shaped vesicle caused
by extended carbon chain of RGO. The self-assembled indolium–RGO
vesicles become diluted because of the strong intrachain interactions
of indolium ions which favored the formation of lateral RGO sheets.
At a high ratio of RGO-indolium, vesicles are overloaded in the reaction
and polymer chains do not develop to the same magnitude in every vesicle.
Consequently, we acquire a different type of morphology. The rod-shaped
morphology developed through the emergence of vesicles within a longitudinal
direction and the graphene sheets is possible through the agglomeration
of unused a-RGO sheets, which is shown in the TEM image. The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns for PIn (Figure 3A′) consists of the
continuous ringlike patterns revealing the amorphous nature of PIn.
However, the SAED pattern of Gr1@PIn and Gr3@PIn shows some distinct ringlike patterns (Figure 3B′,C′) besides the continuous
ring, revealing the appearance of crystallinity attributable to the
presence of RGO because RGO concentrations increase crystallinity
in polymer nanocomposite.

and (C′) Gr3@PIn SAED pattern of the corresponding
TEM images.

The FTIR spectrum of
PIn, Gr1@PIn, and Gr3@PIn is shown in Figure 4. The major peak
at ∼3350 cm–1 has
shown N–H stretching; the peak at 1600–1400 cm–1 indicates C–C stretching of the benzenoid ring of indole;
peaks at 1450 and 1383 cm–1 revealed the C–N
and C=N stretching, respectively, out of plane deformation
of benzene, indicated by the peak at 735 cm–1.24,26 Furthermore, peak at ∼3350 cm–1 confirms
that no polymerization has occurred at nitrogen.26,27 The spectrum of the nanocomposite, that is, Gr@PIn (Gr1@PIn and Gr3@PIn) displayed the same but weak peaks as
PIn at 619, 1118, 1383, 1608, and 3350 cm–1, which
correspond to −C–H, −C–N, −C–C,
−C=C, and −N–H stretching vibrations,
respectively (all functional group vibrations incorporated in Table 1), and synthesized
RGO, FTIR are incorporated into Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. In Figure S2, the spectrum of RGO exhibits the existence of the basal plane of
graphene sheet at 1690 cm–1 and a broad peak at
3400 cm–1, associated with O–H vibration.
This is worth noting that most of the significant FTIR peaks of PIn
shifted, with regard to the lesser value of wavelength in the Gr@PIn
nanocomposite which has correlated with the confined growth and restricted
modes of vibrations in the PIn, in the presence of RGO on account
of π–π interactions between RGO layers and aromatic
PIn rings.24,26,28

Raman spectrographic analysis had become one among the foremost
widespread techniques for the characterization of disordered and amorphous
carbons. In Figure 5, the PIn, Gr1@PIn nanocomposite, and Gr3@PIn
nanocomposite were studied by Raman spectroscopy. Figure S3 (Supporting Information) revealed that two prominent
peaks at around 1340 and 1592 cm–1 were related
to the verified G band (E2g symmetry of sp2 carbon
atoms) and D band (breathing mode of A1g symmetry and relevant
to structural anomalies and disorder) with a D/G ratio of 1.42, respectively.
The spectrum for the nanocomposite (Gr@PIn) showed that two strong
peaks have shown for all of these samples at 1355 and 1587 cm–1, significant to D and G bands which represent different
atomic ratios of sp3/sp2 carbons.24 The D/G intensity ratios of Gr1@PIn
nanocomposite and Gr3@PIn nanocomposite are 1.32 and 1.36,
respectively. From Figure 5, it clearly shows that PIn polymerization does not influence
the structure of RGO (Figure S3), and the
intensity ratio of graphene and Gr@PIn nanocomposite revealed more
sp3 carbon owing to the efficient relationship between
PIn and RGO with a D band ratio to G band varying from 1.26 to 1.36
for graphene and Gr@PIn nanocomposite, respectively.29

PIn and Gr@PIn Optical
Characteristics
The UV–vis
absorption spectra of the pure PIn and Gr@PIn nanocomposite (Gr1@PIn nanocomposite and Gr3@PIn nanocomposite) recorded
at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide solvent are shown in Figure 6. The UV–vis
spectra of the PIn show characteristic bands at 280 nm, that of Gr1@PIn show characteristic bands at 284 and 326 nm, and that
of Gr3@PIn show characteristic bands at 290 and 333 nm,
respectively. The bands have occurred around 326–333 nm, which
may be assigned to the π to anti-π (π → π*)
transition of the aromatic C–C bonds and to the n to anti-π
(n → π*) transitions of the C=O bond.17,30 The absorption peak at 280–290 nm is because of the photon,
that is, π–π* transition in benzenoid rings. These
transitions increase the conducting property because of the benzenoid
rings and the formation of polaron in the nanocomposite. This effect
attributes to the increase in adsorption coefficient.5 However, Gr@PIn nanocomposites have given rise to the gradual
decrease in the peak intensity at around 280 nm and other peak formations
between 350 and 400 nm with a redshift because of the incorporation
of RGO as well as the increase in the concentration of the nanocomposite
(Gr1@PIn and Gr3@PIn). The 610 nm peak could
be allotted because of the polaronic excitation peak and its position
around minimum absorption sides. The absorption spectra of Gr@PIn
reveal the distinctive feature in contrast to pristine PIn. Mainly
n to π* transition would exist in nanocomposite, whereas the
π–π* transition seemed to be altered to higher
energy region with a lower intensity of polaronic peak (610 nm), that
unveiled the interactions between graphene and PIn.31

and Gr3@PIn.

PIn and Gr@PIn Thermal Characteristics
The composition
and structure of the PIn, Gr1@PIn, and Gr3@PIn
have analyzed by TGA. As demonstrated in Figure 7, all of the samples reveal slight mass depletion
around 100 °C caused by the deintercalation of H2O.
PIn started off to disintegrate at a quite low temperature below 250
°C and comprehensively oxidized at around 600 °C. The carbonized
fragments remained even at a higher temperature. The outcome revealed
the covalent bond lead in the best thermal stability within Gr1@PIn and Gr3@PIn nanocomposites. Noticeably, there
was rarely any mass loss at 100–300 °C for nanocomposite,
that is, Gr@PIn, which revealed that the oxygen-functionalized groups
were very scarce.32 It also finally demonstrated
a mass loss of 37 and 28% between 170 and 600 °C for Gr1@PIn and Gr3@PIn nanocomposites, respectively, which primarily
attributed to the decomposition of the PIn. The outcome mentioned
above proposed the robust covalent bond interaction between PIn and
RGO and performed a crucial role in the enhancement of thermal stability
of the nanocomposite.

and Gr3@PIn.

Antibacterial Assessment of PIn and Gr@PIn Nanocomposites
In light of the convincing evidence, the expanded growth of high
resistance in the clinical isolates of MRSA and newly evolved families
of antimicrobial agents have a short life span; thus, the need to
explore new antibacterial drug is of superior importance. Researchers
are nowadays drawing their attention to graphene-based nanocomposite,
trying to explore the emerging prospects and to evolve superior graphene-based
antimicrobial drugs against MRSA. The antibacterial potency of the
in situ Gr@PIn nanocomposite was calculated against resistant SA isolates.
Standard vancomycin was taken as a controlled standard antibiotic.
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for the graphene-based
nanoclusters (NCs) was found to be around for Gr3@PIn nanocomposite
128 μg/mL against MRSA ATCC 43300 and 64 μg/mL against
MRSA ATCC BAA-1708, whereas the other Gr1@PIn nanocomposite
had an MIC of 256 μg/mL for both of the strains. The PIn alone
had an MIC of 512 μg/mL for both of the MRSA strains, whereas
the vancomycin had an MIC of 16 and 8 μg/mL for different MRSA
strains, respectively. Further, the antibacterial potential of our
synthesized NCs was evaluated by agar diffusion assay (Figure 8A). The zone of inhibition
assay suggested the active bactericidal activity of nanocomposite
against the two tested MRSA bacteria. The ROS produced by internalized
nanocomposite damages DNA and other cellular machinery components
of bacteria. Live-dead assay employing fluorescence microscopy also
established the antimicrobial potential of nanocomposite against MRSA
strains. The bacterial cells in their log phase were treated with
different Gr@PIn nanocomposite formulations for 3 h, followed by staining
with the propidium iodide (PI) and SYTO-9 dyes. In general, PI penetrates
cells with disrupted and damaged membrane lesions. The NC treatment
resulted in profound staining of cells with PI probe. The control
group (live cells) showed green fluorescence, whereas the experimental
samples treated with various formulations for 3 h showed bright red
fluorescence. Because of the binding of dye with DNA of dead bacteria,
dead cells appeared sharp red in points because of acquired PI. The
PI bound to the double-stranded DNA is an indicator of NC-mediated
damage of bacterial cell wall33 (Figure 8B). [Data are not
shown for MRSA ATCC 44300]. The Gr3@PIn nanocomposite showed
a prominent antibacterial effect against both of the MRSA strains,
as suggested by agar diffusion results (Table 2). Among various treatment groups, Gr3@PIn nanocomposite-treated group showed profound bacterial
inhibition.

To study the antibiofilm activity of graphene-based PIn nanocomposite,
the XTT assay was performed. The data obtained exhibited the dose-dependent
antibiofilm activity of graphene-based nanocomposites (Figure 9) (data are not shown for MRSA
ATCC 44300). There was a significant decrease in the bacterial count
[p-value < 0.01 (**)] of both of the MRSA strains
in the group treated with Gr3@PIn nanocomposite as compared
with the vancomycin treatment. No significant difference was found
between the Gr3@PIn nanocomposite and vancomycin-mediated
killing of MRSA. The observation concords with the zone of inhibition
assay.

Figure 9 Antibiofilm activity of different Gr@PIn formulations (A). Effect
of Gr@PIn nanocomposite against biofilm development in MRSA ATCC BAA-1708
strain. Growth inhibition was assessed by comparing relative metabolic
activity determined using XTT assay; untreated control was considered
showing 100% activities. Experiments were performed in triplicates;
results are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD); **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001.

However, PIn-treated groups showed
shallow inhibitory activity
as compared to the Gr3 and Gr1 groups; thus,
the higher activity is due to the presence of Gr groups that are responsible
for enhanced ROS production, thus assisting the likely antibiofilm
effect. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that significant reduction
in CFUs was evident in both of the cases when compared to positive
control group (Figure 10) (MRSA ATCC 43300 also responded in the same manner upon treatment
with Gr1@PIn nanocomposite; however, data are not shown
with regard to simplicity).

Effect of Gr3@PIn Combination on Bacterial Cell Wall
as Revealed by EM Analysis
SEM microscopy was employed to
analyze the surface morphology variations of the control and treated
MRSA ATCC BAA 1708 bacterium with synthesized Gr1@PIn and
Gr3@PIn nanocomposite. As demonstrated in Figure 11A, control MRSA ATCC BAA 1708
bacterium was mostly round with smooth morphology and intact cell
surfaces. To treat with Gr3@PIn NCs, cell walls of MRSA
ATCC BAA 1708 bacterium turned into wrinkled and disrupted morphology
with the impaired surface. Further, bacterial cell lysis resulted
in the release of cytosolic content upon their exposure to the Gr3@PIn formulation (Figure 11B) (data are not shown for MRSA ATCC 44300). Additionally,
bacterial cell lysis was confirmed through TEM in Figure 11B. Herein, apoptosis has occurred
through the cytosolic content release upon treatment with Gr3@PIn nanocomposite.

various Gr3@PIn with MRSA ATCC BAA-1708 strain. B. TEM

Hemolysis Assay
The essential leading function of every
preferred pharmaceutical drug candidate is that the product should
be biocompatible, and it should be nontoxic toward healthy cells.
Therefore, to study its biocompatibility, the synthesized Gr@PIn nanocomposite,
red blood cell (RBC) lysis test was conducted. The exposure of our
nanocomposite with healthy cells revealed little or no toxicity and
led to minimal lysis of healthy cells. As demonstrated in Figure 12, the Gr3@PIn NCs around 27.2% and Gr1@PIn showed lysis of 27%
(P ≤ 0.001) additionally at a higher concentration
of 512 μg/mL. Although, similar to the concentration increases,
the cell viability declined proportionally.

Antibacterial Potential
of Gr@PIn Nanocomposite against S. aureus Skin Infection in Balb/C Mice
Keeping into consideration
the strong antibacterial potential of
Gr3@PIn combating against both MRSA ATCC 43300 in addition
to ATCC BAA-1708 isolates, we evaluated its probability to cure acute
cutaneous dermatitis contagion in the animal model. As shown in Figure 13A, reddening of
the skin in Balb/C mice because of being exposed against MRSA triggered
cutaneous bacterial infections and resulted in localized skin disruption.
The remaining bacterial load in the skin was analyzed through the
details of bacteria in the given specimen by culturing in the solid
agar medium. The outcomes revealed that the Gr3@PIn treatment
efficiently eliminated skin infection (Table 3, Figure 13 B). Supplementing with Gr3@PIn causes immense
reduction in the bacterial burden (∼45% reduction) when compared
to untreated control (P < 0.005).

(B) Mice were infected topically with MRSA ATCC BAA-1708 and treated
with various Gr@PIn groups concurrently after infection. Mice inoculated
with phosphate-buffered saline alone were used as a control. After
treatment with various Gr@PIn, skin lesions were cut; the homogenized
and bacterial count was determined by CFU assay on the 11th day; (C)
on day 11, biopsy specimens were taken instantly after the conclusion
of the experiment, fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formalin and embedded
in parafilm. The biopsy specimens were stained with HE. Experiments
were performed in triplicates; results are shown as mean ± SD;
***P ≤ 0.001.

Histopathological Analysis
With the various Gr3@PIn formulation, we studied histopathological analysis of
the infected Balb/C mice through the bacterial burden, skin architecture,
and sustained inflammatory changes. On day 11 postinfection, the treated
skin samples were taken out aseptically and stained using hematoxylin
and eosin (HE) staining. The healthy group exhibiting normal skin
histology has a regular intact epidermal layer, unlike MRSA-infected
skin experiencing thin epidermal layer with dysfunction through the
existence of a significant number of inflammatory cells. Figure 13C reveals that
treatment with Gr3@PIn leads to healing of epidermal layer
with negligible skin damage. In conclusion, right after the Gr3@PIn NCs formulation treatment, the skin attained a typical
architecture.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
successfully synthesized an active antibacterial
Gr@PIn nanocomposite via eco-friendly and facile strategy, and RGO
was achieved through the reduction of exfoliated GO using the glucose
as a reducing agent. The Gr@PIn was effective in inhibiting MRSA and
was seen to be resistant to a vast area of antibiotics. The mechanism
of antibacterial action of Gr@PIn nanocomposite could adhere toward
the bacterial surface, irreversibly interrupting the membrane layer
structure of the bacteria, eventually penetrating cells, and efficiently
impeding protein activity, which inherently turns into bacteria apoptosis
in vitro. Electron microscopy revealed the bacterial surface deterioration
through the Gr@PIn nanocomposite. Additionally, Gr@PIn nanocomposite
has the potential to inhibit the S. aureus-mediated lysis of RBCs. In conclusion, our study suggests that the
synthesized Gr@PIn nanocomposites have great antibacterial characteristics
against MRSA with minimal toxicity and biocompatibility as found in
vitro studies. Remarkably, Gr@PIn nanocomposite revealed great potential
to prevent bacterial infection under in vivo environments and eradicate S. aureus-mediated skin contagion in BALB/c mice.
The antimicrobial Gr@PIn nanocomposite might be promising as antimicrobial
drugs for the decolonization of MRSA and the treatment of MRSA-associated
diseases. The Gr@PIn was additionally efficient in suppressing MRSA
and found to become resistant up to a range; this is undoubtedly large
for antibiotics.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of RGO
To synthesis GO, we used modified
Hummer method with 20 μm mesh and Sigma-Aldrich graphite powder
as a precursor, in continuation of our earlier work.16−19 RGO sheets were synthesized through the followed method: 50 mL of
homogeneous GO dispersion (3 and 5 mg mL–1 in two
distinct beakers) was ultrasonicated for 2 h in deionized water; a
colloidal solution obtained in the clear beaker. Following that, 150
mg of glucose was added, followed by the stirring for 24 h. Then,
50 μL of liquor ammonia solution (25 w/w %) was added to the
colloidal solution of GO in each beaker and vigorously agitated during
30 min and after that retained at 90 °C for 1 h. The solution
was obtained at room temperature, centrifuged, and cleaned out with
ethanol and water and then was dehydrated at 40 °C in a vacuum
oven for 24 h. RGO powder was obtained.

Synthesis of Gr@PIn (Gr1@PIn and Gr3@PIn)
Nanocomposite
For the synthesis of Gr@PIn (Gr1@PIn and Gr3@PIn) by varying the RGO concentration for
the 3 mg mL–1 (Gr1@PIn) and 5 mg mL–1 (Gr3@PIn), 1 M sodium dodecyl sulfate
surfactant was dissolved in ethanolic solution (1:1 ethanol and water)
and stirred continuously for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 1 M indole
was introduced under constant stirring, followed by RGO. After stirring
for 3 h, 1.5 M anhydrous FeCl3 was added slowly into the
stirred solution. The solution rapidly turned into light green as
anhydrous FeCl3 was dropped into the solution. The commixture
was placed inside a conventional microwave oven (Samsung Electronics,
750 W) at an irradiation power of 180 W for 3 min. The dark green
precipitate was filtered and rinsed by dissolving in ethanol, dichloromethane,
and deionized water repeatedly to remove monomer/oligomer and unreacted
oxidant.34 Eventually, the synthesized
sample was dried out into a vacuum oven and stored for analysis. The
same process was used for indole polymerization through the conventional
strategy, utilizing anhydrous FeCl3 as the oxidant. Also,
PIn samples were synthesized through the microwave irradiation according
to a similar procedure stated above. Nevertheless, synthesized PIn
was washed repetitively through ethanol and after that by dichloromethane
to eliminate the unreacted monomer and dehydrated in a vacuum desiccator.
