Hollow glass microsphere-reinforced
epoxy hollow spheres (HGMS–EHSs)
were prepared by a “rolling ball method” using expanded
polystyrene beads, HGMSs, and epoxy resin (EP). The three-phase epoxy
syntactic foam (epoxy/HGMS–EHS–HGMS composite) was fabricated
by combining HGMS–EHS as a lightweight filler with EP and HGMS
by a “molding method”. The HGMS–EHS and epoxy
curing agent systems were well mixed by scanning electron microscopy.
Experiments show that higher HGMS–EHS stack volume fraction,
lower HGMS–EHS layer number, higher HGMS–EHS diameter,
lower HGMS–EHS density, higher HGMS volume fraction, and lower
HGMS density result in a decrease in the density of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam. However, the above factors have the opposite
effect on the compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam. Therefore, in order to obtain the “high-strength and
low-density” three-phase epoxy syntactic foam, the influence
of various factors should be considered comprehensively to achieve
the best balance of compressive strength and density of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam. This can provide some advice for the preparation
of buoyancy materials for deep sea operations.

Introduction
The
solid buoyancy material is a low-density, high-strength, seawater-resistant
composite foam material. It is mainly used to provide net buoyancy
for various underwater operating systems, ensuring that its counterweight
equipment can work stably and safely under water.1,2 At
the same time, it also has the advantages of low water absorption,
good weather resistance, resistance to hydrostatic pressure, and large
safety and reliability. It can be applied to the buoy system, marine
mining system, deep sea carrying operation equipment, marine survey
and monitoring system, offshore oil system, and so forth.3−5 The syntactic foam buoyancy material forming process can be further
subdivided into the casting method, the vacuum impregnation method,
the liquid-transfer molding method, the particle deposition method,
and the molding method.5 Among them, the
compression molding method is ideal, and it is also the most commonly
used molding method. In order to obtain a low-density solid buoyancy
material, along with the addition of a blowing agent to the matrix
resin, a lightweight filler may be added.6,7 The
latter is the most effective way to obtain low-density three-phase
composite buoyancy materials at present, among which the lightweight
fillers are the most widely used hollow glass microspheres (HGMSs).8,9

HGMSs are hollow glass thin-walled beads with a diameter ranging
from several micrometers to hundreds of micrometers and appear gray
or white.10−13 It has many advantages such as loose drying, good fluidity, strong
mechanical properties, low density, and so forth.14,15 The density of the HGMSs is generally in the range of 0.1–0.6
g/cm3, and the density of the three-phase composite buoyancy
material prepared from the reinforced hollow spheres thereof is generally
in the range of 0.2–0.7 g/cm3.16−18 Solid foam
materials can be classified into one-phase foam materials and two-phase
and three-phase syntactic foam materials because of their different
compositions.19,20 The one-phase foam material mainly
refers to a polymer-based foamed material such as a polystyrene foam
material and a polyurethane foam material.21−24 The polymer foamed material has
a low compressive strength and is highly limited. The two-phase syntactic
foam material refers to a composite of epoxy resin (EP) and hollow
glass microbeads, and the added HGMSs reduce the density of the buoyant
material and show good compressive strength.25,26 The three-phase syntactic foam material is based on a two-phase
syntactic foam material with some hollow materials, such as hollow
glass bead-reinforced hollow spheres.27 Because the HGMS-reinforced hollow sphere has good compatibility
with the resin matrix, it can be well combined in the preparation
process.28 Therefore, the three-phase syntactic
foam in which HGMS-reinforced hollow spheres are added not only has
a lower density but also maintains a strong compressive strength.29,30

In this experiment, HGMS–epoxy hollow sphere (EHS)
reinforced
by hollow glass beads was used as the third phase to adjust the density
of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam. The three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam was prepared by EP/HGMS-reinforced EHS–HGMS (EP/HGMS–EHS/HGMS)
by molding. The three-phase epoxy syntactic foam has the advantages
of low density and high strength. The effects of HGMS–EHS diameter,
stacking ratio, layers, types, and fillers on the density and compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam will be studied.
The microstructures were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM).

Results, Analysis, and Discussion
HGMS–EHS Macroscopic
Morphology and Density Characterization
Figure 1 shows the
digital image of HGMS–EHS. As can be seen from the figure,
the HGMS–EHS blended with the epoxy curing agent system/HGMS/EPS
has a uniform surface. This feature facilitates better integration
with the matrix, resulting in better mechanical properties of the
three-phase composite buoyancy material.

Figure 1 Digital image of HGMS–EHS.

Figure 2 shows the
relationship between the HGMS–EHS diameter and density. Figure 2a is a representation
of the density at different layers of HGMS–EHS with an initial
diameter of 7–8 mm. As can be seen from the figure, the average
density of the HGMS–EHS-1 layer is 0.092 g/cm3;
the average density of the HGMS–EHS-3 layers is 0.249 g/cm3. Figure 2b
is a representation of the density at different layers of HGMS–EHS
with an initial diameter of 9–10 mm. As can be seen from the
figure, the average density of the HGMS–EHS-1 layer is 0.079
g/cm3; the average density of the HGMS–EHS-3 layers
is 0.221 g/cm3. Figure 2c shows the density characterization of HGMS–EHS
with different types of HGMS. As can be seen from the figure, the
average density of HGMS–EHS with K1 hollow glass microbeads
was 0.103 g/cm3; the average density of HGMS–EHS
with S38HS hollow glass microbeads was 0.158 g/cm3. Figure 2d is a comparison
between the densities of two different diameters of HGMS–EHS.
The average density of HGMS–EHS-2 layers-7–8 mm is 0.192
g/cm3; the average density of HGMS–EHS-2 layers-9–10
mm is 0.158 g/cm3.

Figure 2 Relationship between the HGMS–EHS diameter
and density;
(a) Ø EPS-7–8 mm (S38HS); (b) Ø EPS-9–10 mm (S38HS); (c) different HGMS, Ø EPS-9–10 mm; and (d) different diameter HGMS–EHS-2
layers.

It can be concluded from Figure 2a,b that when the
initial diameter of the EPS is the
same, the density of HGMS–EHS increases as the number of layers
of HGMS–EHS increases. Figure 2c shows that the density of HGMS–EHS enhanced
by S38HS is higher than that enhanced by K1 when the initial diameter
of EPS is the same and all of them are 9–10 mm. It can be seen
from Figure 2d that
when the number of layers of HGMS–EHS is the same, the smaller
the diameter of HGMS–EHS, the higher the density.

Characterization
of Density and Compressive Strength of the
Three-Phase Epoxy Syntactic Foam
Effect of HGMS–EHS
Filled with Different Stacking Volume
Ratios on Density and Compressive Strength of the Three-Phase Epoxy
Syntactic Foam
Figure 3 is a graph showing the density change of a three-phase epoxy
syntactic foam filled with different stacking volume fractions of
HGMS–EHS. It can be seen from the figure that the density of
the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam ranges from 0.578 g/cm3 (0%) to 0.575 g/cm3 (20%), 0.523 g/cm3 (40%),
0.487 g/cm3 (60%), 0.427 g/cm3 (80%), and 0.404
g/cm3 (90%). Figure 4 is a graph showing the compressive strength change of a three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam filled with different stacking volume fractions
of HGMS–EHS. It can be seen from the figure that the compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam ranges from 33.72
MPa (0%) to 29.96 MPa (20%), 27.05 MPa (40%), 22.08 MPa (60%), 19.76
MPa (80%), and 18.02 MPa (90%). From Figures 3 and 4, it can be
concluded that the density and compressive strength of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam without HGMS–EHS are the largest. With
the increase of HGMS–EHS stacking volume fraction, the density
and compressive strength begin to decrease. The three-phase epoxy
syntactic foam without HGMS–EHS is actually a two-phase syntactic
foam. It consists of an epoxy curing agent system and HGMSs. Its interior
is solid and has no voids, so its compressive strength is very large.
The compressive strength of the three-phase syntactic foam with HGMS–EHS
(20, 40, 60, 80, 90%) begins to decrease. First, HGMS–EHS is
the hollow material because it has already been shrunk inside itself.
Second, the composite foam is no longer a pure entity, and voids have
already been created. As the number of HGMS–EHS increases,
the number of internal voids increases, and the compressive strength
decreases.

stacking volume fractions of HGMS–EHS.

Figure 4 Compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam filled
with different stacking volume fractions of HGMS–EHS.

From Figures 3 and 4, it can be concluded
that with the increasing stacking
volume fraction of HGMS–EHS, the density and compressive strength
of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam are reduced. Therefore, it
is necessary to find the balance point between density and compressive
strength so as to achieve the best combination of high strength and
low density of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam.

Characterization
of Density and Compressive Strength of the
Three-Phase Epoxy Syntactic Foam Filled with Different Layers of HGMS–EHS
Figure 5 is a graph
showing the density change of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam
filled with different layers of HGMS–EHS at HGMS–EHS
stacking volume fractions of 60, 80, and 90%. It can be seen from Figure 5a that the density
of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam ranges from 0.422 g/cm3 (0 layer) to 0.467 g/cm3 (1 layer), 0.487 g/cm3 (2 layers), and 0.510 g/cm3 (3 layers); the density
of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam in Figure 5b ranges from 0.367 g/cm3 (0 layer)
to 0.409 g/cm3 (1 layer), 0.427 g/cm3 (2 layers),
and 0.486 g/cm3 (3 layers); the density of the three-phase
material in Figure 5c ranges from 0.317 g/cm3 (0 layer) to 0.380 g/cm3 (1 layer), 0.404 g/cm3 (2 layers), and 0.464 g/cm3 (3 layers). Figure 6 is a graph showing the compressive strength of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam filled with different layers of HGMS–EHS
at HGMS–EHS stacking volume fractions of 60, 80, and 90%. It
can be seen from Figure 6a that the compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy composite
foam ranges from 10.54 MPa (0 layer) to 18.09 MPa (1 layer), 22.08
MPa (2 layers), and 27.42 MPa (3 layers); the compressive strength
of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam in Figure 6b ranges from 7.78 MPa (0 layer) to 15.41
MPa (1 layer), 19.76 MPa (2 layers), and 23.63 MPa (3 layers) and
that shown in Figure 6c ranges from 7.08 MPa (0 layer) to 15.34 MPa (1 layer), 18.50 MPa
(2 layers), and 23.58 MPa (3 layers). From the longitudinal view of Figures 5 and 6, that is, the volume fraction of HGMS–EHS remains
unchanged; the density and compressive strength of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam increase with the increase of HGMS–EHS
number, which is independent of the volume fraction of HGMS–EHS.
From the horizontal view of Figures 5 and 6, that is, the number
of layers of HGMS–EHS remains unchanged, and the density and
compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam under
four layers increase with the increase of HGMS–EHS volume fraction,
which is consistent with the conclusion of Figures 3 and 4. With the increasing
number of layers of HGMS–EHS, the compressive strength and
density of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam increase. Therefore,
considering the density and compressive strength, HGMS–EHS
(2 layers) is an ideal number of layers. The density compression ratios
of the two-layer three-phase epoxy syntactic foam are 0.0221 (60%),
0.0216 (80%), and 0.0218 (90%), respectively. By comparison, it can
be concluded that the density compression ratio of the three-phase
material filled with 80% HGMS–EHS is almost the same as that
of the material filled with HGMS–EHS 90%, but the density of
the three-phase material filled with 90% HGMS–EHS is lower.
Therefore, it is desirable to choose HGMS–EHS volume fraction
90%.

foam at 60% HGMS–EHS stacking volume fraction; (b) density

foam at 90% HGMS–EHS stacking volume fraction.

Characterization of Density and Compressive Strength of the
Three-Phase Epoxy Syntactic Foam Filled with Different Diameters of
HGMS–EHS
Figure 7 is a graph showing the density change of a three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam filled with different diameters of HGMS–EHS.
It can be seen from the figure that the density of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam ranges from 0.450 g/cm3 (the initial
diameter of HGMS–EHS is 7–8 mm) to 0.404 g/cm3 (the initial diameter of HGMS–EHS is 9–10 mm). Figure 8 is a graph showing
the change in compressive strength of a three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam filled with different diameters of HGMS–EHS. From the
figure, it can be concluded that the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam
has a compressive strength of 22.50 MPa (the initial diameter of HGMS–EHS
is 7–8 mm) to 18.02 MPa (the initial diameter of HGMS–EHS
is 9–10 mm). It can be seen from Figures 7 and 8 that the density
and compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam decrease
with the increase of the diameter of HGMS–EHS.

Characterization of Density and Compressive Strength of the
Three-Phase Epoxy Syntactic Foam Filled with Different Volume Fractions
of HGMS (S38HS) in the Epoxy-Hardener System
Figure 9 is a graph showing the change
in density of HGMS in the epoxy-hardener system of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam. When the stacking volume fraction of HGMS–EHS
in the mold is 90%, the density of the three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam ranges from 0.492 g/cm3 (40%) to 0.453 g/cm3 (50%), 0.404 g/cm3 (60%), 0.367 g/cm3 (70%),
and 0.342 g/cm3 (75%). Figure 10 is a graph showing the change in compressive
strength of HGMS in the epoxy-hardener system of a three-phase epoxy
syntactic foam. It can be seen from the figure that the compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam ranges from 14.10
MPa (40%) to 16.07 MPa (50%), 18.02 MPa (60%), 18.70 MPa (70%), and
17.03 MPa (75%). Figure 11 shows the digital image of the three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam filled with different volume fractions of HGMS (S38HS) in the
epoxy-hardener system. As can be seen from the figure, there is no
HGMS–EHS in the lower half of the sample (40%); there are some
HGMS–EHS in the lower half of the sample (50%); in samples
filled with HGMS (60%), HGMS–EHS was distributed throughout
the three-phase foam. Referring to Figures 9 and 10, it can be
concluded that the density of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam
decreases as the volume fraction of HGMS increases, and the compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam increases first and
then decreases because the HGMS/epoxy curing agent system mixes well
when the HGMS volume fraction is low. When HGMS–EHS was added,
the volume fraction of HGMS–EHS continued to rise because of
the fluidity of the substrate. However, HGMS–EHS in the lower
half of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam becomes very less, that
is, HGMS–EHS is unevenly distributed in the entire three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam, and the compression strength is low. As the
volume fraction of HGMS increases, the fluidity of the HGMS/epoxy
curing agent system becomes poor. The degree of floating of HGMS–EHS
becomes less, that is, it is evenly distributed throughout the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam. Because HGMS–EHS is concentrated in the
upper part, the direct contact probability between HGMS–EHS
and HGMS–EHS is increased, and the compressive strength of
the three-phase epoxy composite foam is lower. It can be seen from
the figure that when the volume fraction of HGMS is 70%, the compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam reaches the maximum
(18.07 MPa). When the volume fraction of HGMS reaches 75%, the compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam begins to decrease.
The reason is that when 75% of HGMS is filled into the epoxy curing
agent system, the entire substrate is almost free of fluidity, resulting
in some HGMS–EHS and HGMS–EHS being in direct contact
with each other. The anticompression ability of HGMS–EHS itself
is very poor, and it can be seen from Figure 3 that the pure matrix has a strong anticompression
ability. It is precisely due to the adhesion of the matrix that all
of HGMS–EHS are combined to make the compression resistance
of HGMS–EHS stronger. Without the bonding of the matrix, the
compression resistance of HGMS–EHS becomes poor, resulting
in a decrease in the compressive strength of the entire three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam.

Characterization of Density and Compressive
Strength of the
Three-Phase Epoxy Composite Foam Filled with Different Kinds of HGMS–EHS
Figure 12 is a
graph showing the change in density of a three-phase epoxy composite
foam filled with different types of HGMS–EHS. It can be seen
from the figure that the density of the three-phase epoxy composite
foam to which HGMS–EHS (K1) is added is 0.331 g/cm3; the density of the three-phase epoxy composite foam with HGMS–EHS
(S38HS) is 0.404 g/cm3. Figure 13 is a graph showing the change in compressive
strength of a three-phase epoxy composite foam filled with different
types of HGMS–EHS. It can be seen from the figure that the
maximum compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy composite foam
with HGMS–EHS (K1) is 16.05 MP; the maximum compressive strength
of the three-phase epoxy composite foam with HGMS–EHS (S38HS)
is 18.02 MPa. From the above two figures, it can be concluded that
as the density of the HGMSs increases, the density and compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy composite foam increase.

Characterization of Density and Compressive Strength of the
Three-Phase Syntactic Foam Filled with Different HGMS-Enhanced Fillers
Figure 14 is a
graph showing the change in density of a three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam filled with different HGMS-enhanced fillers. It can be seen from
the figure that the density of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam
filled with HGMS (K1) is 0.347 g/cm3; the density of the
three-phase epoxy syntactic foam filled with HGMS (S32) is 0.376 g/cm3; and the density of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam
filled with HGMS (S38HS) is 0.404 g/cm3. Figure 15 is a graph showing the change
in compressive strength of a three-phase epoxy syntactic foam filled
with different HGMS-enhanced fillers. It can be concluded that the
compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam filled
with HGMS (K1) is 9.03 MPa; the compressive strength of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam filled with HGMS (S32) is 17.40 MPa; and the
compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam filled
with HGMS (S38HS) is 18.02 MPa. For the three sets of comparisons,
the same HGMS–EHS was used, including the initial diameter,
volume fraction, type, number of layers of HGMS–EHS, and the
volume fraction of HGMS in the epoxy curing agent system. The difference
is that there are only different types of HGMS in the filler. Among
the three HGMSs, the K1 density is the lowest, S32 is the second,
and S38HS is the highest. Therefore, from Figures 14 and 15, it can be
concluded that as the density of HGMS in the filler increases, the
density and compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam increase.

Morphological
Characterization of the Three-Phase Epoxy Syntactic
Foam
Figure 16 shows the sectional view of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam.
The general structure of the three-phase epoxy composite foam can
be seen from the cross-sectional view, where a represents an epoxy
curing agent system-hollow glass microbead composite two-phase system
(epoxy/hardener-HGMS), b represents an EHS (HGMS–EHS), c/d
is the contracted EPS sphere in HGMS–EHS, and e/f are hole
defects. It can be seen from the figure that the centimeter-element
EHS (HGMS–EHS) is evenly dispersed in the epoxy/hardener-HGMS,
and the EPS template has also been uniformly shrunk in HGMS–EHS.
This shows that the composite produced is still very uniform. It can
also be found that there is no obvious interface between HGMS–EHS
and epoxy/hardener-HGMS and they are very tightly combined. The main
reason is due to the fact that the EP for preparing the centimeter
hollow sphere HGMS–EHS is the same as the EP in epoxy/hardener-HGMS,
so the interface is tightly combined. The holes e and f are produced
because of the ingress of air during mixing and preparation. The pores
increase the porosity of the three-phase material, which leads to
a decrease in the bonding strength of the material and also adjusts
the overall density and performance of the material.

Figure 16 Sectional view of the
three-phase epoxy syntactic foam.

Figure 17 is an
SEM image of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam. The figure is divided
into three parts a, b, and c; a is the inner surface of the sphere;
b is the wall of the sphere; c is the outer surface of the sphere,
and inside the red circle is HGMS. It can be seen from the figure
that the inner surface of the sphere is relatively smooth, which helps
to improve the performance of HGMS–EHS and the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam. The dispersion of HGMS in the sphere wall and
the outer surface of the sphere is relatively uniform, and the bonding
between HGMS and HGMS connected by the epoxy curing agent is also
very tight, which is beneficial to the performance of three-phase
materials. At the same time, it can be seen from the figure that there
is no obvious boundary between the sphere wall and the outer surface
of the sphere because the composition of both HGMS and EP is the same.
Because of the same material used, the bond between HGMS–EHS
and the epoxy curing agent system is better and less prone to breakage.

Conclusions
1 The influence of stacking volume fraction
of HGMS–EHS: the maximum compressive strength [HGMS (S38HS),
60%] of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam decreases with the increasing
stacking volume fraction of HGMS–EHS (9–10 mm, 2 layers)
from 33.72 MPa (0%) to 29.96 MPa (20%), 27.05 MPa (40%), 22.08 MPa
(60%), 19.76 MPa (80%), and 18.02 MPa (90%). Its density also decreases
as the HGMS–EHS stack volume fraction increases from 0.578
g/cm3 (0%) to 0.575 g/cm3 (20%), 0.523 g/cm3 (40%), 0.487 g/cm3 (60%), 0.427 g/cm3 (80%), and 0.404 g/cm3 (90%).

2 The influence of layers of HGMS–EHS:
when the stacking volume fraction of HGMS–EHS is 90%, the compressive
strength of the three-phase syntactic foam increases from 7.08 MPa
(0 layer) to 15.34 MPa (1 layer), 18.50 MPa (2 layers), and 23.58
MPa (3 layers). The compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy
composite foam increases with the increase of the HGMS–EHS
layer. With the increasing number of layers of HGMS–EHS, the
compressive strength and density will increase. Because the three-phase
epoxy composite foam prepared by HGMS–EHS (2 layers) has higher
compressive strength than HGMS–EHS (1 layer), the density is
not as large as that produced by HGMS–EHS (3 layers). In order
to balance the density and compressive strength of the three-phase
foam, the two-layer HGMS–EHS is ideal.

3 The influence of diameter of HGMS–EHS:
the larger the diameter of the EPS template, the larger the diameter
of the produced HGMS–EHS. The compressive strength of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam was reduced from 22.50 MPa (HEMS-EHS-7–8
mm 2 layers) to 18.02 MPa (HEMS-EHS-9–10 mm 2 layers). When
the large-diameter HGMS–EHS-filled three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam has a lower density, its compression strength also decreases.
Therefore, the diameter of the EPS should be selected according to
actual needs.

4 The influence
of density of HGMS–EHS:
when the stacking volume fraction of HGMS–EHS is 90%, the compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam rises from 16.05
MPa (HGMS–EHS-K1-9–10 mm 2 layers) to 18.02 MPa (HGMS–EHS-S38HS-9–10
mm 2 layers). Therefore, it can be concluded that the compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam increases as the
density of HGMS–EHS increases. When the density of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam filled with HGMS–EHS (S38HS) becomes higher
than that of HGMS–EHS (K1), the compressive strength also increases.
Therefore, it is necessary to select a specific type of HGMS–EHS
according to specific requirements.

5 The influence of volume fraction of
HGMS: the compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam increases from 14.10 MPa (40%) to 16.07 MPa (50%), 18.02 MPa
(60%), and 18.70 MPa (70%) and then decreases down to 17.03 MPa (75%).
The compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam increases
from 40 to 70%. The reason is that with the increasing HGMS volume
fraction, the fluidity of the matrix is getting worse and worse, resulting
in the decrease of HGMS–EHS floatation, that is, HGMS–EHS
can be distributed evenly throughout the three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam. When the volume fraction of HGMS reaches 75%, the compressive
strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam suddenly drops. The
reason is that the matrix filled with HGMS (75%) has substantially
no fluidity, which makes it easy for HGMS–EHS to come in contact
with each other so that the entire foam has poor compression strength.

6 The influence of HGMS type:
when the
HGMS in the epoxy curing agent/HGMS system has the same volume fraction
(60%), the compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic
foam reduces from 18.02 MPa (S38HS) to 17.40 MPa (S32) and 9.03 MPa
(K1). Because the density of different HGMSs is different, the densities
of the three HGMSs of K1, S32, and S38HS are 0.125, 0.32, and 0.38
g/cm3, respectively. When the density of HGMS increases,
the density and strength of HGMS–EHS will increase first, and
then the density and compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy
syntactic foam, which is composed of HGMS–EHS as a filler,
will also increase. From the above discussion, it can be concluded
that the type of HGMS will affect the density of the three-phase epoxy
syntactic foam, but the effect on its compressive strength is the
opposite. Therefore, in order to obtain a higher strength three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam, HGMS (S38HS) or HGMS (S32) can be selected.
In order to pursue the low-density performance of the three-phase
epoxy syntactic foam, HGMS (K1) can be selected. In practice, the
type of HGMS should be selected according to the requirements of working
conditions (Table 1).

Formula
In order to compare the effects
of different diameters, different layers, different types, different
volume fractions of HGMS–EHS, different volume fractions of
HGMS, and different epoxy curing agent systems on the performance
of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam, in this experiment the following
ratios were adopted. The initial foam balls (EPS) were 7–8,
9–10 mm. The number of layers of HGMS–EHS was 1, 2,
3 layers. Hollow glass bead-enhanced hollow spheres: K1 enhancement
hollow spheres and S38HS enhanced hollow spheres. Three HGMSs are
set in the matrix: S38HS, S32, and K1 (see Table 2 for details).

Preparation of the Epoxy
Composite-Reinforced Hollow Sphere
HGMS–EHS was prepared
by a “rolling ball method”. Figure 18 depicts the preparation
process of HGMS–EHS. (a) is an EPS pellet. (b) is a mixed pellet
of EPS and an EP curing agent system. (c) is a HGMS, that is, an unreduced

The preparation process is as follows: step 1:
3 parts of EP and
1 part of curing agent are weighed and placed in a defoaming mixer,
and the stirring time is set to 5 min, the rotation speed is 2000
rpm, and then the epoxy curing agent system can be obtained. Step
2: weigh a certain amount of EPS (Figure 18a) and the epoxy curing agent system to
mix evenly. (The ratio of epoxy curing agent to EPS ball is 39 g of
EP and 13 g of curing agent per 10 g of pellets). Step 3: put the
epoxy system-coated EPS (Figure 18b) into the ball machine and add HGMS. After the ball
is evenly distributed, remove the epoxy system/HGMS-coated EPS (Figure 18c). Finally, the
epoxy system/HGMS-coated EPS was heated in a vacuum drying oven (DZF,
Shanghai Yiheng Instruments Co., Ltd., China) at 50 °C for 2
h, and the internal EPS pellets were denucleated. After cooling, the
HGMS–EHS was obtained (Figure 18d). Figure 1 shows the preparation process of one-layer HGMS–EHS,
and the two-layer HGMS–EHS performs the process of Figure 1 on the basis of
1 layer and so forth.

Preparation of the Three-Phase Epoxy Syntactic
Foam
Figure 19 shows the
preparation process of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam. Step
1: configure the filler, that is, place the EP, curing agent, and
HGMS in a stirred container and then mix well. The proportion of EP
and curing agent is 3:1 (Figure 19a). Step 2: this step is based on the volume of the
entire mold (Ø 70 mm × 65 mm, H 60 mm). HGMS–EHS was completely filled into the mold (100%),
and then HGMS–EHS with different stacking volume fractions
was selected according to the experimental ratio. Step 3: fill the
filler with HGMS–EHS into the mold. It is necessary to wipe
the inside of the mold and the polyester film multiple times with
a release agent before filling in order to prepare the prepared sample
to be flat and easy to remove from the mold. Step 4: pressurize with
a hot and cold press (CS-105H, Huizhou Chengsheng Hardware Machinery
Equipment Co., Ltd., China) (Figure 19b). A constant load of a standard weight (5.0 kg/cm2) was placed on top of the mold to keep the HGMS–EHS
fully dispersed and prevented from floating. First, pressurize with
a hot press at a temperature of 100 °C for 1 h and then pressurize
with a cold press for 15 min. Step 5: the three-phase composite foam
was allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 h to complete the
curing process (Figure 19c). The quality of each component is calculated as follows

Preparation of the Three-Phase Epoxy Syntactic Foam Filled with
Different Bulk Volume Fractions of HGMS–EHS
Table 3 shows the formulation
of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam filled with different bulk
volume fractions of HGMS–EHS. In order to study the effect
of HGMS–EHS with different stacking volume fractions on the
compressive strength of the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam, six
groups of HGMS–EHS (S38HS) with different stacking volume fractions
of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 90% were selected as fillers to be added
into the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam. The HGMS–EHS (0%)
group was used as a blank compared to the other five groups. The variable
for this experiment is the stacking volume fraction of HGMS–EHS
(S38HS) in the three-phase epoxy syntactic foam.

were the same, in order to study the effect of different layers of
HGMS–EHS (S38HS) on the mechanical properties of the three-phase
composite foam, different layers of HGMS–EHS were added to
the two-phase composite foam. There are two variables in this experiment:
one is the volume fraction of different HGMS–EHSs (60, 80,
90%) and the other is the number of layers of HGMS–EHS (0 layer,
1 layer, 2 layers, 3 layers).

different volume fractions of HGMS (S38HS) on the compressive strength
of the three-phase epoxy composite foam, HGMS with different volume
fractions (40, 50, 60, 70, and 75%) was added into the epoxy-hardener
system to make the two-phase composite foam, respectively. Then, 90%

Performance Measurement and Characterization
The calculation
of HGMS–EHS density is based on the random selection of HGMS–EHS.
The purpose of random selection is to avoid the contingency of the
experiment. Fifty samples were selected for each diameter and type.
The diameter and mass of 50 samples were measured using a digital
vernier caliper (SHAHE, Ningbo KECHENG Instrument Co., Ltd., China)
(accuracy of 0.01 mm) and a digital analytical balance (FA1106, Biuged
Laboratory Instruments (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd., China) (accuracy of
0.001 g). The average density of HGMS–EHS was calculated using
the total mass of 50 samples versus the total volume of the top 50
samples. The formula is as follows  

Three-phase composite
buoyancy material
density calculation: for a three-phase composite buoyancy material,
the mass is measured with a digital analytical balance (accuracy of
0.001 g). The volume is the volume of the mold (Ø 70 mm × 65 mm, H 60 mm), and the density is
the mass divided by the volume.

The mechanical properties of
the three-phase composite buoyancy
material samples were tested by an electronic universal testing machine
(CMT5350, Shenzhen Suns Technology Co., Ltd., China). This experiment
used GB/T16491-2008 as the standard.

SEM (JEM-4701, JEOL, Japan)
was used to observe the wall thickness
of the HGMS-enhanced sphere and its microscopic morphology with the
bond site of the epoxy curing agent system. Before SEM observation,
the sample should be cleaned by an ultrasonic cleaner (SK2200H, Shanghai
Kudos Ultrasonic Instrument Co., Ltd., China) in order to remove some
dust and make the observation results clearer. The principle of preparation
of the SEM sample is as follows: as far as possible, the position
where the ball is relatively regular or large is selected. The sample
includes epoxy curing agent/HGMS system and HGMS–EHS. The sample
used is thin, so it needs to be sprayed with gold in order to impart
it strong conductivity and to make the observation results clearer.
