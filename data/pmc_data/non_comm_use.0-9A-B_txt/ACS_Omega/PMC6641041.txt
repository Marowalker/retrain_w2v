The formation of
materials with tunable wettability is important
for applications ranging from antifouling to waterproofing surfaces.
We report the use of various low-cost and nonhazardous hydrocarbon
materials to tune the surface properties of aluminum oxide nanoparticles
(NPs) from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic through covalent functionalization.
The hydrocarbon surfaces are compared with a fluorinated surface for
wettability and surface energy properties. The role of NPs’
hydrophobicity on their dynamic interfacial behavior at the oil–water
interface and their ability to form stable emulsions is also explored.
The spray-coated NPs provide textured surfaces (regardless of functionality),
with water contact angles (θ) of 10–150° based on
their surface functionality. The superhydrophobic NPs are able to
reduce the interfacial tension of various oil–water interfaces
by behaving as surfactants.

1 Introduction
The
control of surface properties by introducing various organic
molecules, with diverse surface energies, has attracted much research
in the past decades. This is due to the extensive range of potential
applications from self-cleaning, anti-icing, and waterproofing using
superhydrophobic surfaces,1−5 to antifogging and antifouling using superhydrophilic surfaces.6−9 By mimicking the surface structure as of natural phenomena (e.g.,
lotus and rice leaves, butterfly wings, etc.), researchers have reported
processes to control the surface hydrophobicity.10−13 Surface energy and surface structure
are the main parameters essential for designing and fabricating surfaces
with designed wettability.14 Hydrophobic/hydrophilic
surfaces have generally been obtained by creating micromaterials and
nanomaterials to introduce surface roughness and functionalization
in low and high surface energy materials for appropriate surface chemistry.12,15,16 There are various physical and
chemical methods to obtain rough surfaces with the desired surface
energy, including plasma treatment,17 template
methods,18 spin and spray coating methods,19,20 electrochemical methods,21 and bottom-up
fabrication of micro-nanostructure.22

We have previously reported that the superhydrophilic membranes
can be designed using appropriate surface chemistry (such as zwitterion
carboxylic acids).8,9 Following this work, we have shown
that low-cost and hydrocarbon-based superhydrophobic surfaces may
be prepared using alumina nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with
highly branched “hedgehog” carboxylic acids.3,23 Although much previous work has shown that superhydrophobic surfaces
may be designed using fluorocarbon materials,10,15,24−27 our work demonstrated for the
first time, that the superhydrophobic surfaces (contact angle ∼155°)
can be obtained using relatively short-chained, highly branched hydrocarbon
chains (nc = 13–15). As a result
of using these green materials, the undesirable environmental and
commercial consequences of using fluorocarbons could be eliminated.28

In this work, we explore the structure–surface
property
relationships using various carbon chain lengths and branching substituents
to chemically modify aluminum oxide NPs through covalent functionalization,
with various carboxylate derivatives. The results demonstrate that
subtle changes in chain functionality enable the control of surface
wettability, roughness, surface energy, and the NPs ability to behave
as surface-active agents.

2 Results and Discussion
The alumina NPs used in this study have an average particle size
of d = 13 nm and specific surface area of 100 ±
15 m2/g. The carboxylic acids (Scheme 1) were chosen to investigate the effect of
carbon chain length and branching factor on the surface properties
of the NPs. The acids 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (MEEA, I) and octanoic acid (II) have a linear chain
length of nc = 7 and 8, respectively,
whereas 2-hexyldecanoic acid (III) has the longest linear
chain (effective linear chain length) of nc = 10. These two systems were compared with a fluorinated surface,
9H-hexadecafluorononanoic acid (IV)
that was synthesized previously.3

Scheme 1 Carboxylic
Acids with Different Functionalities and Chain Lengths
Investigated for Functionalization of Alumina NPs
The alumina NPs were refluxed overnight in the
presence of the
desired carboxylic acid in the appropriate solvent. Previous work
has demonstrated that the reaction results into covalent attachment
of the carboxylate group to the aluminum oxide surface via a topotactic
reaction.29,30 Furthermore, the interaction is generally
stable up to 250 °C and at pH below 9 (above which the carboxylic
acid is dissociated, causing aggregation).31 The degree of functionalization was determined by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) (Figure 1). The unfunctionalized alumina NPs show only a small mass loss of
<800 °C associated with dehydroxylation of the alumina (Figure 1a). Upon functionalization
with carboxylic acids, mass loss initiates at ca. 250 °C (see
TGA traces of pure carboxylic acids in Figure S1), with rapid weight loss occurring in the range 350–400
°C (Figure 1b–e).
The weight loss and hence the grafting density of the acids were calculated
for each sample (Table 1). In previous studies, it was shown that a packing density of 2–4
molecules per nm2 of linear octadecylphosphonic acid and
octadecyltrichlorosilane is for fully covered flat aluminum surfaces.32 Fully packed surfaces of 6 molecules per nm2 were obtained for linear C16-phosphonic acid-functionalized
aluminum NPs of around 40 m2/g specific surface area.15 Taking into consideration the NPs’ specific
surface area of around 100 m2/g and the bulky and branched
nature of the some of the carboxylic acids used in this study, the
grafting densities of 2–3.5 molecules per nm2 is
in good agreement with these prior results.

Fourier transform infrared attenuated
total reflection (FTIR-ATR)
spectra of carboxylic-functionalized NPs (Figure S2) confirm covalent attachment (chemisorption rather than
physisorption) of the organic functional groups, as after reaction
with the NP surface the C=O stretching band of the carboxylic
acid (ca. 1700 cm–1)33 is reduced or/and replaced by bands at 1400 and 1600 cm–1. These two peaks are due to the symmetric and asymmetric stretches
of carbonyls in bidentate modes.20,30

2.1 Surface Nanostructures
Films of the
NPs were produced by dispersion of the NPs in 2-propanol (2 wt %)
and then spray coated onto microscope slides at 80 °C. The coated
surfaces were then analyzed by contact angle measurements, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Static
and dynamic equilibrium contact angle and surface free energy (SFE)
of the native and functionalized surfaces are summarized in Table 2, and the images of
the droplets are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen from the water and oil contact angle
data, the hydrophobicity/olephobicity of the hydrocarbon surfaces
correlates with the SFE on the basis of the surface functionality.
It has been reported that the SFE decreases in the order of CF3 < CF2H < CF2 < CH3 < CH2.23,34,35 The film with MEEA NPs exhibits the highest surface energy of 80.7
mN/m due to the (−OCH3) functionality and therefore
superhydrophilicity and superolephilicity properties. Whereas films
with octanoic NPs exhibit a lower SFE of around 53 mN/m due to the
presence of CH2 and CH3 functionality. By introducing
branches into the system, such as 2-hexyldecanoic-NPs, the SFE reduces
to ca. 48 mN/m and hydrophobicity and olephobicity increase by around
10 mN/m. The increase in superhydrophobicity in the branched systems
has been observed previously, and it is believed to be a direct consequence
of increasing the CH3/CH2 ratio per acid chain
compared to that of normal linear HC chains.3,23,36 The hydrocarbon surface’s wettability
was compared with that of the fluorinated films functionalized with
9H-hexadecaflurononanoic NPs. As can be observed
from the data, the films with CF3 and CF2H have
a hydrophobicity similar to that of octatonic NPs due to the same
number of carbons in the acid chains; however, as the hydrogen is
replaced by fluorine the olephobicity has increased, which in turn
reduces the SFE to around 6 mN/m, which is in a typical range for
the fluorinated surfaces.12,34,37

The film roughness was measured using
AFM (Figure 3). The
roughness of the coatings increased
gradually from those with no functional group (native NPs) to those
with the branched hydrocarbon functionality (Table 3). The rms roughness (Rq) values for the films formed from octanoic
and 2-hexyldecanoic NPs is about 100 nm compared to those of the unfunctionalized
surfaces (Rq ∼60 nm). Increases
in roughness can account for some of the observed increase in contact
angle on the basis of the Wenzel and Cassie theory.38,39 The roughness of the surfaces with MEEA NPs increased slightly from
those of the native NPs to around 80 nm. However, as both hydrophobicity
and hydrophilicity are reinforced by roughness, the already high surface
energy MEEA NP films become more hydrophilic due to the roughness.40,41 This demonstrates that roughness alone is not responsible for the
hydrophobicity and chemical treatment of a surface (surface functionality)
also has a big role. The combination of both roughness and surface
chemistry defines the wetting properties of a surface.

of (a), the particles were unstable due to electrostatic effects when
contacted by the probe, and as a result, obtaining images with a scan
size of 10 × 10 μm2 was not possible.

The film morphology was also examined by SEM, and the images of
the superhydrophobic (2-hexyldecanoic NPs) and superhydrophilic (MEEA
NPs) films are shown in Figures 4. The SEM images of the native NPs and the other functionalized
NPs are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S4) for comparison. The modified particles have similar
surface morphologies, which consists of NPs aggregated into a complex
porous structure. However, they show a unique difference to the native
NPs, that is, the functionalized particles appear to be packed much
more efficiently than unmodified particles, as is also evident from
the AFM images in Figure 4. A difference in the packing density is also observed within
the modified NPs with different functionalities. As shown in Figure 4, the branched 2-hexyldecanoic
NPs generate densely packed disordered surface layers permitting high-density
surface coverage of CH2 and CH3 groups compared
to those generated by NPs functionalized with MEEA.

2.2 NPs’
Influence on Liquid–Liquid
Interfacial Tension (IFT)
To explore the potential applications
of these particles, the stability of the NPs in various oils and their
ability to form stable oil/water emulsions were examined. The effect
of these NPs on reducing the water/oil IFT for potential enhanced
oil recovery applications was also studied. The dispersibility of
NPs in water and in different oils for 0.5 and 1 wt % concentrations
were examined and are summarized in Table S2. This experiment was carried out to provide evidence of suitable
solvents to use for emulsion formation. The data indicated that the
higher the NPs’ concentration the lower the dispersibility
in the selected solvents. As was expected, 1 and 0.5 wt % of hydrophilic
NPs (native and MEEA NPs) displayed stability only in water, whereas
the rest of the functionalized NPs had no dispersibility in water.
The most superhydrophobic NPs (2-hexyldecanoic NPs) showed the most
dispersibility in a majority of the oils studied, especially at 0.5
wt % concentration. The fluorinated functionalized NPs were not stable
in any solvent tested here due to both their hydrophobicity and olephobicity
properties.

After establishing suitable solvents for the NPs,
the effect of the NPs’ concentrations (0.5 and 1 wt %) on IFT
of the different oils in water was examined. The octanoic NPs and
2-hexyldecanoic NPs were initially dispersed in oils for measuring
the IFT of oils in water, whereas native NPs and MEEA NPs were dispersed
in water for water-in-oil IFT measurements. The interfacial measurements
were carried out over 30 min and the mean values are given in Table 4. In general, 1 wt
% NPs have a larger effect in reducing IFT compared with 0.5 wt %
NPs. It can be observed from the data that the IFT values decrease
with increasing hydrophobicity of the NPs. The difference in IFT reduction
can be explained according to the surface functionality of the NPs.
The more hydrophobic surfaces (octanoic NPs and 2-hexyldecanoic NPs)
behave more closely to surface-active amphiphilic surfactants at the
oil–water interface, resulting in the highest reduction in
IFT. However, more hydrophilic NPs (MEEA NPs and native NPs) provide
the least surface activity and therefore the lowest IFT reduction.
From the standard deviation data it can also be concluded that the
superhydrophobic NPs reach equilibrium (at the oil/water interface)
much faster than the hydrophilic functionalized NPs. This behavior
was also observed by Rana et al.,42 wherein
variations in the hydrophobicity of monolayers changed the interfacial
behavior of NPs.

Alumina and functionalized
NPs were used to stabilize oil/water
emulsions. Octanoic NPs and 2-hexyldecanoic NPs were dispersed in
hexadecane, and various fractions of water (10–90%) were added
before emulsification. Native alumina and MEEA NPs were dispersed
in water, and fractions of hexadecane were varied. The emulsions formed
by 2-hexyldecanoic and MEEA NPs are shown as a model compound in Figure 5a,b, respectively.
As can be seem from the Figure 5a, around 5 min after emulsification, one-phase emulsions
(type IV)43 were formed for 10–50%
water addition and two phases (with excess water, type II) were observed
for 75–90% water. After 1 day the one-phase emulsions were
changed to two phase (with excess oil, type I); however, the emulsion
fractions were still significant beyond 1 day (e.g., 0.6 for 90:10
and 0.9 for 50:50 oil–water ratios). The same behavior was
observed for octanoic NPs, excepting a difference that was observed
at the 50:50 oil–water ratio, at which the type II emulsions
were observed beyond 1 day. Figure 5b shows the small volume of emulsions formed by MEEA
NPs, and as can be observed, immediately after emulsion formation,
type II (with excess water) were formed for 10–50% oil addition
and type I (with excess oil) emulsions were formed insignificantly
for 75–90% oil. After 1 day, the small fraction of emulsions
that were stabilized by NPs stayed the same; however, the NPs’
rich water phases were unstable, and NPs appeared to precipitate out
of the water phase. The same behavior was also observed for native
NPs.

added water (10–90% from left to right), and (b) MEEA NPs dispersed
in water, with added hexadecane (10–90% from left to right)
5 min after preparation, after 1 day, and after 3 days from top to
bottom, respectively.

3 Conclusions
Although previous work
has shown that superhydrophobic surfaces
may be prepared using various fluorocarbon low surface energy chemicals15,26,27 and hedgehog hydrocarbons,3 this work focuses on hydrocarbon linear and branched
carboxylic acids (with different surface energies) to demonstrate
that hydrophobicity can be readily tuned on the basis of the nature
of the chemical functionality. The resulting functionalized NPs created
films with different hydrophobicity despite having comparable effective
chain length. The dispersibility of the NPs in various solutions was
directed by the functionality of the surfaces. Centered on the NPs
dispersibility in various oils, the stability of oil–water
emulsions using NPs and the effect of the NPs in reducing IFT was
studied for the first time. The results have shown that the IFT is
reduced greatly in the presence of superhydrophobic NPs at 1 wt %
concentration, as they perform in the same way as amphiphilic surfactants.
The understanding of the relationships between the superhydrophobic
and superhydrophilic NPs and the resulting oil stability, emulsion
properties, and IFT at the oil/water boundary is highly instructive
yielding insights that could greatly benefit the future development
of enhanced oil recovery. Our future studies include micromodels of
oil displacement studies to evaluate their application as a replacement/modification
of surfactant flooding.

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
and Characterization
Alumina
NPs (Aeroxide-Alu), all of the carboxylic acids, 2-propanol, and all
of the oils (n-decane, hexadecane, toluene, and hexane)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Distilled
water (15 MΩ cm; Millipore) was used throughout the experimental
process.

TGA experiments were conducted on a TA Instrument,
SDT Q600. The samples were run in an open alumina crucible under continuous
air flow. The heating profile was equilibrated at 50 °C and then
ramped at 20 °C·min–1. SEM was performed
with a Hitachi field emission S-4800 microscope. FTIR measurements
were performed with a Thermoscientific i510 recording spectra in the
400–4000 cm–1 region, with 16 scans. Contact
angle measurements were obtained by the sessile drop method (resulting
static contact angle, advanced and receding contact angle), using
a DSA25 Expert Drop Shape Analyzer (Krüss) under ambient conditions,
using deionized water. Diiodomethane was also used for SFE measurements.
Each stated contact angle is the average of three measurements from
various positions on the surface. AFM and tapping mode cantilevers
(RTESP; Bruker) were used for surface imaging. The AFM tips were 10
nm in radius. Images for each sample were obtained using intermittent
contact mode, at a scan rate of 0.5–1 Hz and an image resolution
of 512 × 512 pixels. Images were obtained with a scan size of
10 × 10 μm2. The captured images were analyzed
using JPK offline-processing software to determine the surface roughness
from the AFM scans. The mean roughness measurements determined the
average (Ra), root-mean-square (Rq), and peak-to-valley roughness (Rt) for each sample type.

4.2 Synthesis
of Covalently Functionalized Carboxylate
NPs
The synthesis procedure is based upon a modification
of literature procedures.8,44 The alumina NPs were
refluxed overnight in toluene (100 mL) with the carboxylic acids 2-hexyldecanoic
acid and 9H-hexadecafluorononanoic acid and in methanol
(100 mL) with octanoic acid and 2-2-2-methoxyethoxyethoxy acetic acid.
The functionalized particles were then centrifuged for 30 min and
then redispersed in 2-propanol (2 × 30 mL) and ethanol (1 ×
30 mL) and then centrifuged again to remove unreacted carboxylic acid.
Finally particles were oven dried at 80 °C overnight.

4.3 Spray Coating of Nanoparticle Films
Nanoparticle dispersions
in 2-propanol (2 wt %) were sprayed onto
glass slides. The slides were heated at 80 °C during the spray
coating. The spray coating was performed until a film was optically
visible (typically three layers of coating). The coatings were kept
consistent among the samples, and it was made sure that visually there
were no signs of large aggregates on the glass. The glass-coated surfaces
were therefore slightly bluish and completely transparent. The NPs’
film sticks to the glass sufficiently to obtain stable results for
the surface characterization techniques; however, it is possible to
scratch the coating if contacted by a sharp material.

4.4 NPs’ Stability in Oils and IFT Measurements
Native and the functionalized alumina NPs (0.5 and 1 wt %) were
dispersed in various oils by sonicating in an ultrasonic bath for
15 min and then were left on a roller mixer for 2 h before the IFT
measurements. Density of the oils in the presence of each nanoparticle
was determined for accurate IFT measurements. The density was measured
by weighting exactly 1 mL of each nanofluid and then dividing the
mass by volume. The measurement was repeated three times to minimize
the error, and the density values are given in the Supporting Information, Table S1. IFT of NPs at the various oil–water
interfaces was measured using the pendant drop method (DSA25 Expert
Drop Shape Analyzer; Krüss).

4.5 Emulsion
Preparation
Emulsions were
prepared by initially dispersing 1 wt % of unfunctionalized and MEEA
NPs in water and hydrophobic NPs in various oils. The oil used was
selected on the basis of the NPs’ dispersion stability. For
each type of emulsion, five different water and oil ratios (90, 75,
50, 25, and 10) were used, and then the emulsions were made by probe
sonicating (Cole Palmer Ulterasonic Processor) the sample for 4 min
at 20% amplitude. The resulting emulsions and the phase ratios were
immediately examined visually, after 24 h and after 3 days. Emulsions
of alumina NPs functionalized with 9-hexadecafluronaraic acid were
not prepared because of their lack of stability in any of the oils
tested.
