The
binding site of the macrolides laulimalide and peloruside A,
which is different from that of the clinically useful drugs paclitaxel/taxol
and ixabepilone (tax site), is known to be between two
adjacent β-tubulin units (ext site). Here, we report
our study of the binding of these molecules to an α1β1/α2β2-tubulin
“tetramer” model. AutoDock 4.2.6//AutoDock Vina dockings
predicted that the affinities of laulimalide and peloruside A for
the tax site are quite similar to those for the ext site. However, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated
that only when these two ligands are located at the ext site, there are contacts that help stabilize the system, favoring the
β1/β2 interactions. The binding affinity of laulimalide
for this site is stronger than that of peloruside A, but this is compensated
for by additional β1/β2 contacts that are induced by peloruside
A. MD studies also suggested that epothilones at the tax site and either laulimalide or peloruside A at the ext site cause similar stabilizing effects (mainly linking the M-loop of
β1 and loop H1–B2 of β2). In a “hexamer”
model (3 units of αβ-tubulin), the effects are confirmed.
Metadynamics simulations of laulimalide and peloruside A, which are
reported for the first time, suggest that peloruside A produces a
stronger change in the M-loop, which explains the stabilization of
the β1/β2 interaction.

Introduction
Laulimalide
(1) and peloruside A (henceforward peloruside, 2) are antimitotic macrolides isolated from marine sponges
that grow in the Pacific Ocean, around Indonesia, Vanuatu, Okinawa,
and the Marshall Islands and around New Zealand, respectively (Figure 1).1,2 In
sharp contrast to other microtubule-stabilizing agents (MSAs), such
as paclitaxel/taxol, docetaxel/taxotere, epothilones A and B (3a and 3b), and many other macrolides, which
bind to β-tubulin at the so-called taxol site (henceforward tax site), compounds 1 and 2 compete
with each other but not with the former macrolides for the tax
site and, consequently, retain their activity against taxol-resistant
tumors.

Figure 1 Laulimalide (1) and peloruside (2), two
macrolides that share a common binding site, different from the tax site. Epothilones 3a and 3b.

As is well-known, paclitaxel is
used clinically against breast
and ovarian cancer treatments, whereas ixabepilone is a macrolactam
analog of 3b that is useful against metastatic breast
cancer. Although the toxicity of 1 is disappointing,
the antiangiogenic effect and the activity against neurodegeneration
and autoimmune disorders of 2 maintain hopes for the
development of clinical uses of these MSAs. Very recent excellent
reviews and full papers summarize these studies.3−16

Two issues have worried bioorganic and medicinal chemists
for a
long: (a) where is the binding site of 1 and 2? (b) How two molecules (ligands) that are so different structurally
can share the same binding pocket? The fact is that 1 has two hydrogen-bond donors and clog P = 2.19
± 0.55 (so it is relatively hydrophobic), whereas 2 has five hydroxyl groups and clog P = 0.44 ±
0.67 (so it is quite polar).

The first issue has been solved
in recent years, after some initial
doubts. In fact, more than a decade ago some of us suggested a hypothetical
site in α-tubulin (α site, Figure 2), mainly relying upon blind
molecular docking carried out with AutoDock 3.0 on an αβ-tubulin
dimer.17 This binding site is located below
the B9–B10 loop of α-tubulin, which does not exist in
β-tubulin (where the tax site is found). This loop
has to be raised up to permit the entry of ligands 1 and 2 into this α-tubulin binding pocket, which is rather
similar to the tax site. Surprisingly, molecular docking
calculations predicted that these ligands would have similar binding
affinities for the tax site and α site.18 Jiménez-Barbero et al., after
determining the bioactive conformer of 2 by NMR, confirmed
this α site, also using AutoDock 3.0.18

Figure 2 B9–B10 loop of α-tubulin represented in red.
(A) Original
conformation (closed loop) and (B) conformation revealing
a new cavity (open loop).

However, on the basis of H/D exchange mass spectrometry of
the
complex of bovine tubulin with 2, Schreimer and co-workers
reported in 2008 that the binding site of peloruside was on the external
side (outer surface) of β-tubulin.19 Later, Schreimer et al. confirmed this binding site for laulimalide,
using a mass shift perturbation technique.20 Much more recently, using X-ray crystallography (from cocrystals
of the tubulin dimer, protein RB3, and tubulin tyrosine ligase at
a 2.1–2.2 Å resolution), Steinmetz et al. established21 that 1 and 2 bind
to the β-tubulin pocket already proposed by Schreimer et al.20 and interact with a second tubulin dimer of
the neighboring filament.

Henceforward, we call this external
binding site “the ext site”. In other words, 1 and 2 link two vicinal β-tubulin units
(in two different
filaments). Calculations concerning this issue by Hamel et al. (1 and 2, Glide),22 by Horwitz and co-workers (1 and 2, AutoDock),23 and by Liao et al. (2, AD4.2 and
AMBER 10)24 are worth noting. Two excellent
articles, by Tuszynski et al. (1, AMBER 12 and AMBER
14),25,26 which appeared when the present study with
other methods had started, are also key because, as it will be demonstrated
herein, our results confirm and complement them. As a matter of fact,
there are important differences with the outcomes of the previous
computational studies, as recognized by the authors themselves, although
most are minor. Sometimes, three binding sites were found. Liao et
al.,24 for instance, found that the tax site was the most favorable for 2, followed
by the ext site and by a new site in α-tubulin,
but outside the B9–B10 loop. We cannot repeat or even summarize
here all the agreements and divergences, but it is understandable
that the use of tubulins arising from different animal sources, the
nature of the characterization techniques for such delicate complexes,
the features of the cocrystals (sometimes quite artificial in relation
to the intracellular world), the disparate calculation methods and
their simplifications, and so forth cannot give rise to identical
results. Generally speaking, all of the studies are “approaches
to the truth”.

Be that as it may, for 1 and 2, there
is sufficient experimental evidence in favor of the ext site, an outer site between two adjacent β-tubulins (in vicinal
filaments). No doubts remain. Why was the AutoDock method unable to
locate this binding site more than 12 years ago?17,18 Are there updated docking methods currently available that are much
more reliable in this respect? We would like to consider these questions.

In a preceding paper,27 we examined
the pros and cons of several updated docking programs (AutoDock, UCSF
DOCK, and Glide), as far as the reproduction of Protein Data Bank
(PDB) structures of cocrystals of proteins and natural macrolides
or related compounds is concerned. Because AutoDock methods allow
for a global blind docking, we used here AutoDock 4.2.628 (henceforward AD4.2), AutoDock Vina29 (ADVina), and AutoDock PSOVina (PSOVina).30 AD4.2 has a scoring function based on a semiempirical
force field, which includes intramolecular terms, a full desolvation
model, and the entropic energy of the ligand, whereas Vina has a hybrid
scoring function (a mixture of empirical- and knowledge-based scoring
function) with a more rapid and accurate search algorithm for the
binding mode predictions29 and PSOVina
combines the particle swarm optimization algorithm with the local
search method adopted in Vina.30 Vina and
PSOVina give less reliable scoring values than AD4.2, but they are
extremely quick. In this context, we demonstrated27 that the rescoring of Vina with AD4.2 (which we called
AD4.2//Vina) gave rise to better results (energy gaps between poses),
so it turned out to be our method of choice for macrolide–receptor
interactions. Thus, we have included here AD4.2//Vina calculations.
Also, we have examined for the first time AD4.2//PSOVina (i.e., rescoring
with AD4.2 of the docked poses obtained from PSOVina).

Here,
we first check whether AD4.2, ADVina, and PSOVina can detect
the above-mentioned binding site (ext site) or not, with
models of microtubules. Afterward, with the refinement provided by
the rescorings and MD calculations, we compare the features of the
interaction of 1 and 2 with the amino acid
units of the ext site, that is, we analyze the second
issue mentioned in the preceding paragraphs regarding the analogies
and differences between 1 and 2.

Results
and Discussion
Blind Docking to the αβ-Tubulin
Dimer Model
First of all, PDB structure 1JFF was overlapped with 2XRP, to treat α-tubulin
as we did.17 The B9–B10 loop was
maintained in an
open conformation. Blind docking with different programs indicated
the binding sites marked in Figure 3. The outcomes are summarized in Table 1. A long hyphen in a column of this and the
following Tables mean that the percentage of low-energy conformers
found at that site was <5%.

The blind docking results with the
B9–B10 loop in its “open
arrangement” (Table 1) located many conformers (over 50% in 7 out of 10 calculations
of Table 1) at the
α site, although the conformer with the lowest binding energy
did not coincide from one docking program to another.

For 1, with AD4.2, ADVina, and AD4.2//PSOVina, the
conformation with the lowest binding energy was in the α
site (−8.83, −8.3, and −8.43 kcal/mol,
respectively). However, the AD4.2//Vina rescoring method predicted
it would be at the ext site, with a binding energy of
−9.65 kcal/mol.

Meanwhile, the blind docking of 2 suggested that the
conformation with the lowest binding energy was at the α
site with AD4.2 (−5.31 kcal/mol), whereas it was at
the ext site (−6.8 kcal/mol) with ADVina. Nevertheless,
rescorings with both AD4.2//Vina and AD4.2//PSOVina predicted that
the highest affinity conformation would be at the tax site (−6.66 and −5.06 kcal/mol, respectively). By the way,
the binding energies obtained with AD4.2 are not very different from
those we had obtained with the old AutoDock 3.0.

We estimated
the barrier associated with the opening of the B9–B10
loop, the pocket here called α site, at the OPLS2005
level. We found no suitable bonds whose rotation allowed the pocket
to be opened with a barrier lower than 20 kcal/mol. Thus, this α site probably does “exist”, but we expect
that it is usually inaccessible. Moreover, for this allosteric site
to be effective, it should be capable of producing additional favorable
interactions between this α-tubulin (α1) and the closest
α-tubulin (α2) in the vicinal filament. We did not observe
any such α1/α2 interaction in silico (proceeding in the
same way as described below, with a tetramer model, for β1/β2
interactions). We (some of us) obviously thus retract part of the
previous results concerning the chances for the α site published in 2004.17 The main issue was
not the poor performance of the old AutoDock because some of the updated
AD calculations shown in Table 1 also suggest that the affinities for this site and/or the
percentages of conformers binding to it are high.

With the B9–B10
loop “closed”, that is, in
its expected arrangement, the tax site was predicted
(Table 2) to “contain”
most conformations as well as a good percentage of those conformations
that showed the highest affinities in the case of 1.
In the case of 2, the conformations with the highest
affinities were generally those predicted to interact with the ext site. Interaction with the outside part of the B9–B10
loop (on, around, and near the above-mentioned α site, which is now “closed”) was predicted by all of the
methods to be irrelevant.

To summarize, an overall
view of Table 2 suggests
that 1 has a preference
for the tax site, whereas 2 would rather
stay at the ext site. The structural differences between 1 and 2, especially the fewer polar groups and
hydrogen-bond donors in 1, may explain the preference
of 1 for a more
hydrophobic pocket such as the tax site (the binding
pocket of clinical drugs that are hardly soluble in water, such as
paclitaxel, for which clog P = 3.95 ± 0.81).

Docking to a Tubulin Tetramer Model
Going further, Figure 4 shows a new model
with two α-tubulins and two β-tubulins (α1β1/α2β2,
the minimum representative fragment of two adjacent filaments of a
microtubule), to evaluate features of the lateral contacts. Other
authors have very recently calculated the interactions of tetramers
with 1(25,26) or with 2(24) via other methods. Our blind docking outcomes
in the case of 1 are shown in Figure 4 and the results for 2 in Figure 5. The dockings were
only carried out on α1β1 and the upper part of α2β2
(for the sake of simplicity and computer time issues).

model (α1β1/α2β2), according to ADVina and
PSOVina.

Figure 5 Blind docking of 2 on the upper
part of a tetramer
model (α1β1/α2β2), according to ADVina and
PSOVina.

Significant percentages of poses
are found in the pore (around
the pores), but these values are not indicated in Table 3, which only shows the binding
affinities and the percentage of conformers from Figures 4 and 5 concerning the tax site and the ext site. The affinities for α site (“closed”)
are very low, and the percentages of conformers near this zone are
insignificant (<5%); therefore, these values are not included in Table 3 and neither are they
considered anymore herein.

Table 3 suggests
that 1 and 2 may be distributed similarly
at the tax site and the ext site, although
each docking approach predicts different percentages. We also note
that 1 interacts more strongly than 2 with
both sites, in general. Furthermore, in the light of AD4.2//Vina,
there is one pose of 1 and another of 2 with
the highest affinities for the ext site. The details
of their binding modes are shown in Figure 6. Thus, the best pose of 1 shows
a hydrogen bond with Ser298 (a distance of 1.9 Å) and hydrophobic
interactions between the 3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety
and Tyr342, Pro307, and Tyr312. Meanwhile, there are several hydrogen
bonds between the OH groups of 2 and Phe296 (1.9 Å),
Ser298 (2.3 Å), and Arg308 (2.1 Å), as well as a weaker
hydrogen bond (3.0 Å) with Asp120 of the adjacent β-tubulin
(β2); ligand 2 also shows hydrophobic contacts
with Tyr312 and Tyr342.

with AD4.2//Vina.
Hydrogen bonds and interatomic distances (Å) are shown in red.
Hydrophobic contacts are depicted in gray (dotted lines).

We carried out docking experiments in which both
pockets, tax site and ext site, were occupied
with ligands
at the same time: the tax site with a competitor of paclitaxel
and docetaxel, such as epothilone A, 3a, and the ext site with either 1 or 2. It
did not allow us to observe significant differences with respect to
filling the model with only one ligand. The fact is that the approach
of the M-loop to the β2-tubulin is similarly favored in both
cases. There seems that the effect of 3 and the effect
of 1–2 do not significantly potentiate
each other, even if (or when) they are located in the same β-tubulin.
This agrees with the cryo-electron microscopy (EM) studies of Nogales
and co-workers (Kellogg et al.),7 who concluded
that “simultaneous binding cannot be the reason for the synergistic
effect observed in the cellular context”.

Molecular Dynamics
Simulation of the Tetramer Model
Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of the tetramer (α1β1/α2β2),
with or without the ligand docked on the external site of β1
(i.e., between β1 and β2), were first performed with trajectories
of 20 ns. The calculations were later repeated with longer trajectories
(50 ns), which confirmed the initial results. Various parameters were
analyzed throughout the trajectory, especially the root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) of backbone atoms and the total number of intermolecular
hydrogen bonds between the ligand and protein. As is known, the evolution
of rmsd values from the starting structure is important for the convergence
of the system. From the simulations in the absence of ligand, we observed
that the rmsd oscillated between 1.24 and 7.89 Å, with a mean
value of 5.25. The rmsd of the complex with 1 varied
from 0.99 to 4.39 Å, with a mean value of 3.50 Å. The complex
with 2 oscillated between 1.12 and 4.29 Å, with
a mean value of 3.28 Å. The rmsd values of all of the protein
atoms, with and without the ligands inside, are shown in Figure 7, which indicates
that the two complexes reached an equilibrium state after ca. 7.5
ns. Thus, 50 ns simulations are long enough to stabilize the systems.

Figure 7 rmsd plot
of the interaction between β1-tubulin and β2-tubulin
without any ligand (blue), with 1 inside the ext
site (red), and with 2 at the ext site (orange).

The root-mean-square
fluctuation (RMSF) analysis of the β1-tubulin–ligand
complexes showed more fluctuation in the residues corresponding to
the M-loop region (ca. 3.5 Å). The plot revealed that Ser280
has a high RMSF value (4.4 Å). In general, the RMSF values decreased
slightly with the ligands inside, as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 RMSF plot of β1-tubulin. Graphic representation
of the M-loop
and helices 9 and 10 (H9 and H10).

The binding mode of 1 at the ext site (Figure 9) showed
three hydrogen bonds: with the side chain of Ser298 at a distance
of ca. 2.0 Å and with 40% binding during the simulation; with
the side chain of Asp297 (1.8 Å/81%); and with Asn339 (2.0 Å/76%).
Hydrophobic interactions of the 3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran
moiety with Phe296, Tyr342, Phe343, Pro307, and Tyr312 were also evident.
In the case of 2, five hydrogen bonds were noted: with
Phe296 (1.8 Å/99%), Tyr312 (1.8 Å/98%), Ser298 (2.4 Å/83%),
and Gln293 (1.9 Å/40%), as well as with Asp120 of β2 (2.0
Å/87%). This last hydrogen bond is now predicted to be much stronger
than by docking. Hydrophobic interactions of 2 with Pro307
and Tyr342 are also pointed out in Figure 8. The conclusion is that both 1 and 2 bind to the ext site with the “weapons”
they have: the less polar ligand, 1, with one hydrogen
bond and three hydrophobic contacts; the more polar molecule, 2, with three hydrogen bonds and two hydrophobic contacts.
Moreover, 2 exhibits one further hydrogen bond with the
neighboring β2, which may make the β1/β2 interaction
stronger.

Figure 9 Binding modes of 1 (A) and 2 (B) after
the MD simulations. Hydrogen bonds are shown as red dotted lines,
with interatomic distances in angstrom, and amino acid residues in
blue. Hydrophobic contacts are indicated in gray. All interactions
of 1 are with residues of β1, whereas 2 also interacts with Asp120 of β2.

The agreement between Figure 6 (AutoDock) and Figure 9 (MD) is not perfect, but it is remarkable. The difference
is that the MD simulations detected some additional interactions,
readily noted by comparing Figures 6 and 9.

Binding Energy Calculations
First, we calculated the
binding energies of the two complexes using molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann
surface area (MM–PB/SA). This method has been used to evaluate
the relative binding stabilities of supramolecular systems.31 It has also been applied to better understand
the interactions, by decomposing the total binding energy into its
various components. We found an average binding energy of −39.39
± 2.77 kcal/mol for 1 and of −33.16 ±
3.07 kcal/mol for 2. Thus, the binding affinity of 1 for the ext site is higher than that of 2. On the basis of the individual contributions to the binding
energy, it may be suggested that the van der Waals energy is more
significant in the case of 1, whereas the electrostatic
energy contributed much more to the binding energy for 2, as shown in Table 4.

The binding energy was also decomposed per residue. As shown in
blue bars in Figure 10, the α-amino acid units (residues) that interact more strongly
with 1 than with 2 are Ser298 (−0.94
± 0.05 kcal/mol), Phe307 (−0.69 ± 0.03 kcal/mol),
Tyr312 (−0.95 ± 0.05 kcal/mol), and Val335 (−1.42
± 0.04 kcal/mol). Meanwhile, 2 interacts more strongly
than 1 with Asp297 (−2.41 ± 0.07 kcal/mol),
Asp306 (−1.85 ± 0.04 kcal/mol), and Tyr342 (−1.51
± 0.06 kcal/mol) (see red bars); in contrast, the interactions
of 2 with protonated side chains (the basic Arg308 and
Lys338) are unfavorable. Overall, the protein–ligand affinities
are mainly determined by the residues of the H9–B8 and H10–B9
loops (Figure 11).

Analysis of the Side Contacts
between β1- and β2-Tubulin
We subsequently analyzed
the MD of the lateral contacts between
the two adjacent β-tubulin units (β1/β2) without
any ligand, using Molecular Dynamics consensus (MDcons).32 The principal contact areas (Figure 12) involved M-loop/H9/H10 of
β1 and H3/H2–B3 of β2, that is, between residues
280–340 of β1 and 50–135 of β2. These contacts
are already present in the model (with two filaments close together,
under favorable conditions for the formation of microtubules), as
seen in the 2XRP crystal structure.33−35

β2.

The yellow stripe highlights the interactions of the M-loop.

When the MD simulations were carried
out with either 1 or 2 at the ext
site, new contacts between
the M-loop of β1-tubulin and loop H1–B2 of β2-tubulin
were noted (Figure 13), which appeared to be stronger in the case of 2 than 1. The side chain of Arg284 (guanidinium ion) of β1
interacts with the CO group of the alanyl unit (Ala56 of β2),
whereas the CONH group of Ala285 of β1 interacts with the threonine
OH group (Thr57 of β2). Figure 14 summarizes the interactions. The red circles and arrows
highlight the domains where the number of contacts increased. On the
contrary, the number of contacts between the H9/M-loop regions of
β1 and H3 of β2 decreased slightly. This may explain why
the antitumor activities of 1 and 2, although
all IC50 values are in the nanomolar range, are not as
strong as those of paclitaxel and epothilones.3−16

Figure 13 New lateral contacts between the adjacent β-tubulins (β1
and β2), as predicted by MD simulations with 1 or 2 at the ext site.

Figure 14 Graphic representation of the lateral contacts between β1-
and β2-tubulin of the α1β1/α2β2 tetramer
model, with 1, 2, or 3a at
the ext site of β1 (top) and with 1, 2, or 3a at the tax site of β1 or 3a at the tax site of β2
(bottom). The areas where the changes of the lateral contacts are
predicted to be more relevant, with respect to the tetramer in the
absence of ligands, are highlighted in red circles. As in Figure 12, the yellow stripes
highlight the interactions of the M-loop.

For the sake of comparison, the effect of 3a at the ext site (Figure 14, top) was calculated, with the best docking
pose obtained
from AD4.2//Vina as the starting point. The MD simulations indicated
that 3a at the ext site decreases significantly
the interactions of the M-loop of β1 with the H1–B2 loop
of β2 (red circle). Contacts of the M-loop of β1 (as well
as of H9 and vicinal domains of β1) with H3 of β2 are
noted, but it seems that they are not sufficient compensation.

Also for comparison, the effects of 1, 2, and 3a at the tax site were calculated
(see Figure 14, bottom).
Inside the tax site, only 3a gave rise to
the additional stabilizing contacts (red circle) between β1-tubulin
and β2-tubulin. This occurs either with 3a at the tax site of β1 or β2 (!), indicating that the
allosteric effect is “propagated” in both directions.
By contrast, 1 and 2, although they can
be accommodated within the binding pocket of the tax site, showed fewer contacts between the M-loop (β1) and the H1–B2
loop (β2) (red circle) and also, in comparison with 3a, between the H9/M-loop region (β1) and H3 (β2). Although
not included in Figure 14 to save space, analogous results were obtained with 3b instead of 3a.

It is known36−39 that there is a synergy between the tax site-interacting
MSAs and the ext site-interacting MSAs in tumor cell
cultures, although exceptions have been reported and additional factors
are probably involved.7 As mentioned, the
chances that in vivo one tax site-binding ligand and
one ext site-binding ligand were both bound to a microtubule
at the same β-tubulin unit or at vicinal β-tubulins are
scarce.7 In spite of that to gain insight
into the potential cooperation or the absence of cooperation between
both types of antimitotic drugs, we carried out MD simulations in
which two vicinal pockets were occupied with the corresponding ligands,
that is, the tax site of β1 with 3a and the ext site of β1 with 1 or 2. We observed that the effect of 3a (at its
site) and the effect of 1–2 (at their
site) are similar; they favor the contacts of the M-loop of β1
with the loop H1–H2 of β2 (red circles), as Tuszynski
et al. also showed using AMBER.25 The benefit
of mixing 1 or 2 with 3a, if
they would occupy neighboring sites, may lie on the reinforcement
of the stability of the contacts highlighted by red circles. Furthermore,
the tendency of 3a to improve the contacts between H9/M-loop
and H3 may compensate the tendency of 2 to slightly undermine
or weaken these contacts, with respect to a tetramer already formed,
without ligands, arising from the two neighboring filaments of the
above-mentioned crystal structure. However, the MD results do not
predict a strong cooperation.

MD Simulations of a Hexamer
Model
With the purpose
of confirming or rejecting the preceding observations and assumptions,
a hexamer model (α1β1/α2β2/α3β3,
almost 2700 amino acid units, over 300 kDa) was built up on the basis
of the crystal structure 3JAS (containing three protofilaments) and various MD experiments
were undertaken with ligands 2 and 3a at
the respective binding sites. The results are summarized in Figure 15.

Figure 15 Graphic representation
of the lateral contacts, in a hexamer model
(α1β1/α2β2/α3β3), between β1-
and β2-tubulin and between β2- and β3-tubulin. First
column: MD of the hexamer model (from the crystal structure of three
protofilaments). Second column: one molecule of 2 was
included in the ext site of β1. Third: 2 was included in the ext site of β2. Fourth: 3a at the tax site of β1. Fifth: 3a at the tax site of β2. Red circles,
as always, highlight the interactions between the M-loop and loop
H1–B2.

MD calculations predict
that 2, at β1 or β2,
stabilizes both the union of β1 and β2 and of β2
and β3 via the interactions between the M-loop and loop H1–B2
(red circles). These mainly involve amino acid units Tyr283, Arg284,
Ala285, Thr207, and Glu290 of the M-loop and residues Ala56, Thr57,
Lys60, and Val62 of loop H1–B2. The H9–H3 contacts decrease
significantly or partially or do not decrease (see Figure 15).

Ligand 3a, at the tax site, produces
similar effects. It is also predicted that 3a at its
site stabilizes not only the proximal linkage but also the following
and the previous contacts (red circles), confirming what was noted
in the case of the tetramer model.

The combination of 2 and 3a, at their
respective binding sites (on the same or vicinal β-tubulins,
despite the fact that, as mentioned above, it seems improbable in
practice),7 again showed a moderate or
scarce additivity, as in the tetramer model. Bearing in mind the structure
of a complete eukaryotic microtubule, with 13 protofilaments (and
the features of the seam), the explanation of the synergy or lack
of synergy should be computationally investigated using larger models.

Metadynamics
During the MD simulations of the tetramer
model, we detected transient folded conformations with the M-loop
of β1 adopting an α-helix arrangement but it was not found
to be an energy minimum. Because the cocrystal structures of tubulin
protofilaments with 1 and protofilaments with 2, very recently published,21 showed the
M-loop folded as an α-helix (Figure 16), we have subjected our tetramer model
to a metadynamics simulation with Desmond.32,40 To the best of our knowledge, after an extensive search through
SciFinder and SciFindern, metadynamics simulations of 1 or 2 (interacting with β1) have not been
previously reported. There are no metadynamics studies of other antimitotic
macrolides, the total syntheses of which are a long-standing research
line of the senior author.41−45 There is only one metadynamics study that involves the microtubule-destabilizing
agent combretastatin.46 Two works on the
energy profiles of other antimitotic agents have also been reported.47,48

The results for the complex of 1 with the tetramer
model are shown in Figure 17. The key amino acids indicated by Steinmetz et al.21 were considered in the simulation, with the
distance between Arg284 and Glu290 as CV1 and the distance between
Thr276 and Gln294 as CV2. Two metastates were found: in A, the Arg284–Glu290 distance was shortened to 2.1–3.2
Å (see Figure 17, A), whereas the separation between Thr276 and Gln294
was maintained around 10 Å; in B, these distances
were reduced to 3.7–4.3 Å and around 7.6 Å, respectively.

variables CV1 and CV2 for 1.

The results for the complex of 2 with the tetramer
model are summarized in Figure 18. There are three metastates that have a similar energy.
The above-mentioned distances are reduced to 1.7 and 3.9 Å (see A), to 3.6 and 2.4 Å (see B), and to 3.5
and 3.9 Å (see C).

Conclusions
In a tubulin tetramer model (α1β1/α2β2,
with side contact), rescorings with AutoDock 4.2.6 (AD4.2//Vina) predict
that 1 and 2 have strong interactions at
several points of the tubulin surface. Small percentages of the total
numbers of conformers of 1 and 2 are found
at the tax site and the ext site. At first
sight, this does not agree with the experimental preference of 1 and 2 for the ext site. However,
when β1/β2 lateral contacts are analyzed by means of MD
calculations, once 1 and 2 are at the ext site, it is confirmed that the interactions of β1-tubulin
with the adjacent β2-tubulin become much stronger than when
they are at the tax site (which is a larger pocket that
is hardly affected by the size and noncovalent bonding effects of
these two ligands). Moreover, the more polar molecule, ligand 2, causes a larger shift of the M-loop, which gives rise to
stronger β1/β2 lateral contacts than those provoked by 1. In other words, although molecular docking predicts that
the binding affinity of 1 for the ext site is higher than that of 2, the difference is partially
compensated for by the more favorable β1/β2 lateral interactions
that are induced by 2, as compared to 1.
The metadynamics simulations explain how ligand 1 at
the ext site of β1, by bringing together Arg284
and Glu290, shifts the M-loop to an α-helix conformation, as
well as how ligand 2 forces to an even greater extent
the approach both of Arg284 and Glu290 and of Thr276 and Gln294, which
also causes the M-loop to adopt the α-helix form, in accordance
with the reported crystal structures.21 All of the experimental results are thus in agreement and the main
question posed in the introduction—how can two ligands that
are structurally so different exert similar antitumor activity?—can
be answered as follows:(a) Ligand 1 has a much higher
affinity for the hydrophobic ext site than 2 has.

(b) In contrast,
the more polar ligand, 2, favors the lateral contacts
between the neighboring tubulins
(βn and βn+1) more than 1 does.

(c) In both cases, the interaction between
the M-loop of βn and the H2–B3
loop of βn+1 is favorable (Figures 14 and 15, red circles) and other stabilizing interactions
are maintained. The interaction of the H9/M-loop region of βn with the H3 domain of βn+1 is slightly undermined.

(d) The affinity of the M-loop of βn (for the H2–B3 loop of βn+1) is reinforced after folding to an α-helix,20 which is produced in the case of 2 by shortening distances Arg284–Glu290 and Thr276–Gln294.



The events, when ligands 1 or 2 approach
the binding site, can be represented as in Figure 19 (a cartoon). We are conscious that the
results are approximate because of the unavoidable simplifications,
including the use of tetramers or hexamers instead of large microtubule
portions (MD calculations that are practically infeasible at present),
but they pave the way for future computational studies, in which we
plan to examine more deeply the known experimental synergy between
some tax site- and ext site-binding antimitotic
drugs,43−46 in the light of the cryo-EM studies of Kellogg et al.7 and of the calculations disclosed here. In our
MD simulations on tetramer and hexamer models, adding 1 and 3a or 2 and 3a, both
types of drugs are predicted to favor mainly the contacts between
the M-loop of one β-tubulin with the H1–B2 loop of the
neighboring β-tubulin, as expected.7,25 Moreover,
to our surprise, the contacts between the next and previous pair are
also favored. We also hope to apply the successful methods examined
here to the study of the interactions between other antitumor macrolides
and the cytoskeleton protein actin.

Methods
Tubulin Crystalline Complexes
The crystal structures
of tubulin with laulimalide (PDB ID: 4O4I) and peloruside (PDB ID: 4O4L)21 were downloaded from the PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/). The protein
and nucleotide models were obtained from the 1JFF crystal structure,49 and missing residues 35–60 in α-tubulin
were obtained from the 1TUB crystal structure.50 The
α-tubulin subunit with the “open” B9–B10
loop model was generated from 1JFF coordinates, following Pineda et al.17 The model of two adjacent tubulin heterodimers
(“tetramer” α1β1/α2β2) was obtained
using 2XRP(33) as the template. The “hexamer”
model (α1β1/α2β2/α3β3) was obtained
using the 3JAS crystal structure51 as the template.
Tubulin residue numbering is as defined in Löwe et al.49 As known,3−16 each α-tubulin comprises around 450 amino acid units or residues
and each β-tubulin consists of around 445 amino acid units.
Before starting the calculations, guanosine triphosphate was removed
from the tubulin structures.

Preparation of the Structures and Blind Docking
Coordinate
files for 1 and 2 were extracted from the
corresponding PDB files and used as reference structures for rmsd
calculations. AutoDock 4.2 Tools were used to add polar hydrogen atoms
and Gasteiger charges. The blind dockings were run with AutoDock 4.2.6
(AD4.2) using an empirical free-energy method, with an initial population
of 150 individuals, a maximum number of 2 500 000 energy
evaluations, and a mutation rate of 0.02 (by default). The dockings
were carried out over 50 runs using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm.
The docking area, as defined by the grid box, was centered [100 (x),
80 (y), and 111 (z)], with a size of 50 × 38 × 70 and with
a spacing of 1.000 Å between the grid points. In the case of
AutoDock Vina and PSOVina, the dockings were executed over 50 runs,
with an exhaustiveness of 30.

Molecular Dynamics
All of the MD simulations in this
study were performed using Desmond (release 2016-2).32 Orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions were set up to
specify the shape and size of the repeating unit buffered at 10 Å
distances. The ligand–protein complexes were solvated with
the TIP3P water model, and ions were added to neutralize the system.
Na+ and Cl– ions were also added to the
solvated system at a concentration of 0.15 M. After building the solvated
system, we carried out minimization and relaxation of the ligand–protein
complex under the NPT ensemble using the default Desmond protocol.
The MD simulations were performed with the periodic boundary conditions
in the NPT ensemble using OPLS2005 force field parameters; the ligand−β-tubulin
and β-tubulin−β-tubulin interactions turned out
to be almost identical to those obtained with AMBER.24−26 The temperature and pressure were kept at 300 K and 1 atm (1013.25
hPa), respectively, using Nose–Hoover temperature coupling
and isotropic scaling. Finally, the analysis of the contacts between
the two adjacent β-tubulins was done with MDcons.52

Root-Mean-Square Deviation and Fluctuation
rmsd and
RMSF calculations were carried out using the “simulation–interaction
diagram” scripts.32 Frames from
each interval were aligned to the first frame of the trajectory; the
values were calculated using the backbone α-carbon atoms.

Binding Energy Calculations
Gibbs free energy was calculated
using Gromacs 2016.2,53 from the method
developed by Kumari et al.54 The interaction
energies of 1 and 2 with the microtubule
model (tetramer) were calculated using MM–PB/SA methods for
20 to 40 ns. For each simulated system, total snapshots were taken
from the last 10 ns of the trajectory at the interval of 20 ps. This
methodology includes electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions,
polar solvation energy, and nonpolar solvation energy. The MM–PB/SA
analysis also offers an individual contribution to the binding energy
and per residue contribution that provides the important amino acid,
which can be helpful in designing dual inhibitors.

Metadynamics
Parameters
We have used metadynamics simulations
to construct the free-energy surface (FES) of the tetramer model with
Desmond.32 As known,40 metadynamics is a method that enhances conformational sampling
of the free-energy landscape, by making use of some reaction coordinates.
These reaction coordinates are so-called “Collective Variables”
(CVs). They are carefully selected degrees of freedom along which
the system is expected to proceed by traversing the complete conformational
path. In the present study, the simulation temperature was kept at
300 K and a pressure of 1.013 bar. Initial Gaussian height was kept
at 0.03 kcal/mol. The CVs used for these metadynamics simulations
were the distances between Arg284 and Glu290 and between Gln294 and
Thr276. The simulations were run during 50 ns.
