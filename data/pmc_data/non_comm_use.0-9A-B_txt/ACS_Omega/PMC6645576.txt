Supported bimetallic nanoparticles
are very promising heterogeneous
catalysts for carbon–carbon cross-coupling reactions, though
reports focusing on their synergistic activity for promoting such
reactions are very limited. In the current study, bimetallic Pd–Ag
hybrid nanoparticles supported on carbon quantum dots (CQDs), Pd–Ag@CQDs,
were synthesized by a facile and fast UV-light-driven (365 nm) one-pot
protocol for the first time to investigate such a synergistic activity.
The physico-chemical structural features of the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid
were evaluated by UV–vis, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray
diffraction, electron-dispersive X-ray, and transmission electron
microscopy analyses. The nanohybrid was found to have dimensions in
the range of ca. 3–5 nm. The bimetallic Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid
was utilized as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for promoting
the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction with aryl bromides and
aryl chlorides under ligand-free and ambient conditions. The synergistic
activity of the components of the nanohybrid induced catalytic enhancement
of the cross-coupling reaction in terms of short reaction times (<1
h) and high yields (>90%). The heterogeneous character of the nanohybrid
system also enabled easy separation and recyclability (up to six cycles).

Introduction
Carbon–carbon
(C–C) cross-couplings are one of the
most relevant research topics in the current synthetic chemistry.
These coupling reactions provide a significant tool for the construction
of many important compounds.1 In this context,
the pioneering efforts of Suzuki, Heck, and Negishi toward palladium-catalyzed
C–C cross-coupling reactions are the benchmark for modern synthetic
organic chemistry.2 The Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction is arguably one of the most widely applied
C–C bond formation reactions till date. The aforementioned
reaction provides a potent synthetic pathway for preparing biaryl
compounds, which are generally used in fields of natural products,
pharmaceuticals, agro-chemicals, and polymers.3 The traditional Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction utilizes
homogeneous palladium complexes with ligands (such as phosphine) as
catalysts.4 Despite high activity and selectivity
of these catalytic systems, challenges associated with their recovery
and recyclability limit their utility in the industrial process. Further,
challenges in preparation, cost, and use of toxic ligands (e.g., phosphine)
confine the aptness of such catalysts in large-scale applications.5 In this milieu, heterogeneous palladium catalysis
presents a promising avenue to address these setbacks as validated
by the continuing research efforts in this area.6

Again in recent times, nanocatalysis is being widely
applied in
promoting synthetic organic transformations. These catalysts generally
consist of nano-dimensional active components (metal/metal oxides)
dispersed over a solid support. The catalytic activity, selectivity,
and stability of these nanocatalysts mainly depend upon their shape,
size, composition, and structure.7 These
nano-dimensional particles enhance the surface area of the catalyst,
thereby increasing the chances of contact between the reactants and
the catalyst. Moreover, their heterogeneous nature makes them easily
separable from the reaction mixture, thereby facilitating easy product
isolation. In this regard, palladium-based nanocatalysts are emerging
as one of the most exciting alternative catalysts in the field of
C–C cross-coupling reactions owing to their high activity and
selectivity compared to conventional catalysts.8 As a matter of fact, recent reports on Pd nanoparticle-catalyzed
C–C cross-couplings still suggest its crucial importance in
this scenario.9 Furthermore, considerable
efforts are being devoted to immobilization and stabilization of Pd
nanoparticles (PdNPs) in various heterogeneous supports such as organic
matrices, organic–inorganic fluorinated hybrid materials, polymers,
glass–polymer composites, ionic liquids, and so forth. In addition,
PdNPs are also being synthesized with organic–inorganic supports
such as carbon,10 carbon nanotubes,11 graphene,12 alumina,13 silica,14 zeolite,15 clays,16 iron oxide,17 and zinc ferrite18 for promoting C–C couplings. More recently, biosynthesized
PdNPs are also reported for showing promising catalytic action toward
C–C cross-coupling.19 However, major
drawbacks of such nano-catalysts include aggregation of PdNPs and
the need for additives and stabilizers that hamper the overall reaction
process.

In this juncture, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) represent
an interesting
choice of support because of its high surface functionality, chemical
stability in various media, and inertness to supported metals. CQDs
are promising class of carbon nanomaterials composed of amorphous
and poor crystalline carbon cores (predominantly graphitic sp2 domains) with sizes varying from 2 to 10 nm.20 Apart from displaying a fascinating size- and excitation
wavelength-dependent photoluminescence behavior, CQDs show unique
properties such as excellent aqueous solubility at the nano level,
high photostability, and biocompatibility. All of these factors allow
CQDs to be considered as green, benign, and inexpensive nanomaterials
with a wide range of applicability.21 In
addition, their facile mass scale production from bioresources promotes
their variety of applications. However, the potential of CQDs remains
barely explored in terms of catalytic applications in synthetic organic
chemistry, as compared to other carbon-based nanomaterials such as
carbon nanotubes and graphene. In this regard, our group is currently
engaged in exploring the photo-catalytic activity of CQDs with the
emphasis on promoting clean and green synthetic transformations.22 However, surprisingly, only a few literature
reports cite the use of CQDs in C–C cross-coupling reactions,
with very little information on their role.23 Keeping this in mind, CQDs are used as sites of nucleation and growth
of NPs, forming new functional materials in turn, where CQDs may play
a pivotal role in stabilization of the metal NPs and enhancement of
catalytic activity. Hence, the utilization of CQDs in the formation
and stabilization of Pd–Ag NPs may lead to a stable catalytic
system for the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction. Moreover,
the heterogeneity of the system can offer advantage in terms of catalyst
recovery and recyclability.

Herein, we report the synthesis
of a nanohybrid system of Pd–Ag
hybrid NPs supported over CQDs by a facile UV-light-driven reduction
process using CQDs as the “green” reductant and stabilizer.
The synthesized nanohybrid was characterized by using UV–vis,
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), electron-dispersive X-ray (EDX),
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The Pd–Ag@CQD
nanohybrid was employed as the heterogeneous catalyst for promoting
the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of aryl boronic
acids with aryl bromides and aryl chlorides under ligand-free and
ambient conditions. The nanohybrid was found to immensely enhance
the reaction rate and the product yield. This catalytic enhancement
of the reaction was investigated using different variants of the components
of the nanohybrid.

Instrumentation
UV–visible
spectra were observed by a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (model: UV-300, Thermo Fisher, USA). FT-IR spectra
were recorded on an FT-IR spectrophotometer (model: Impact 410, Nicolet,
USA) using KBr pellets. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were
measured with the help of a powdered XRD (PXRD) machine (model: D8
FOCUS, Bruker AXS, Germany) operating at a wavelength of 1.5 Å
and Cu Kα as a irradiation source. The size, shape, and distribution
of the nanohybrid were observed from a transmission electron microscope
(model: JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan) at an operating voltage of 200 kV using
Cu grid Ultrathin C, Type A, 400 mesh. The microscopic data were analyzed
for inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) images by using Gatan DigitalMicrograph
software. The elemental composition of the nanohybrid was confirmed
through an EDX technique using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
(model: JSM 6390LV, JEOL, Japan) instrument. The surface area of the
nanohybrid was analyzed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
analysis (model: 1000E, Quantachrome, USA). The analysis of leaching
of elements was done by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS, model: NexION 2000, PerkinElmer, USA). The characterization
of the isolated products was carried out using 1H and 13C NMR on an NMR instrument (model: ECS-400, JEOL, Japan)
using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard and CDCl3 as the solvent.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of the Pd–Ag@CQD Nanohybrid
The bimetallic Pd–Ag@CQD
nanohybrid was synthesized by in
situ reduction of Pd2+ and Ag+ ions with as-prepared
CQDs through a UV irradiation-assisted one-step wet chemical protocol,
as depicted in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Pd–Ag@CQD Nanohybrid
It is widely reported that CQDs are capable
of reducing metal salts.23,25 In the current process,
CQDs acted as both reducing as well as stabilizing
agents. As reported earlier, the surfaces of CQDs are enriched with
diverse polar functionalities such as alkoxyl, hydroxyl, epoxy, aldehydic
carbonyl, and carboxylic groups.21 These
surface functionalities facilitated the complexation of Pd2+ and Ag+ ions with CQDs and subsequently helped in their
reduction to Pd0 and Ag0. In addition, CQDs
promoted nucleation-oriented growth of these NPs on their surfaces
and helped in their stabilization. The reduction process was greatly
augmented by the excellent electron-releasing ability of photo-excited
CQDs under UV radiation (λexc = 365 nm), leading
to a dramatic decrease in the reduction time. It is demonstrated earlier
that photo-excited CQDs can serve as both electron donors and electron
acceptors, owing to their photo-ripening capability.22,26 Further evidence for the reduction of Pd2+ and Ag+ ions by CQDs was obtained by observing the dramatic quenching
of the signatory fluorescence emissions of CQDs (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). This UV-light-assisted
fast reduction process was validated by control experiments conducted
under dark and visible light, both of which were recorded for longer
durations (Table S1 of the Supporting Information). Various literature suggested the role of peripheral polar moieties,
especially hydroxyl groups and aldehydic groups, in the reduction
of metal ions.27 In this study, presumably
aldehydic, alkoxyl, epoxy, and hydroxyl groups of CQDs played a pivotal
role in simultaneous reduction of both Pd2+ and Ag+ ions. Details of the reduction mechanism and formation of
the nanohybrid have been provided in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Mechanism of UV-Light-Assisted Reduction
and Subsequent Formation
of the Pd–Ag@CQD Nanohybrid
A UV–vis study suggested the formation of the Pd–Ag@CQD
nanohybrid, considering the changes in absorbance from its precursors
(Figure 1a). The characteristic
absorbance peaks of CQDs at 220 and 280 nm were either obscured or
diminished, along with the absorbance peak of the Pd2+ ion
at 282 nm.19a,24 Further, the appearance of a
continuous absorbance with a weak shoulder between 300 and 380 nm
was attributed to PdNPs, followed by a broad peak at 420 nm corresponding
to surface plasmon resonance of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) pointed toward
the presence of the bimetallic Pd–Ag hybrid phase. Such strong
but broad surface plasmon peaks are well-known in the case of various
metal NPs. The absorbance appears over the wide range of 200–1200
nm.28 These results strongly indicated
the role of CQDs as the reducing agent in the formation of the nanohybrid
and supported the proposed reduction and formation mechanism involving
nucleation and formation of the Pd–Ag nanohybrid on the surface
of CQDs.

(c) EDX map of the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid; and (d) PXRD patterns
of the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid.

FT-IR analysis further revealed key changes in the surface
functionalities
of CQDs before (i), during (ii), and after (iii) the formation of
the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid (Figure 1b). The broad O–H stretching band
of CQD, because of extensive H-bonding between the hydroxyl moieties,
underwent further broadening during the complexation with Pd2+ and Ag+. Ultimately, this broad O–H band underwent
sharpening at 3400 cm–1 after the formation of the
nanohybrid, which indicated the strengthening of the hydroxyl functional
groups, possibly stabilizing the Pd–Ag hybrid particles. The
C–H stretching bands underwent a similar transition during
the process, before finally sharpening at 2926 and 2853 cm–1 after the formation of the nanohybrid. Similarly, the C=O
(carbonyl) stretching band of CQDs endured intensification during
the complexation, along with more intensification and minute shifting
from 1650 to 1670 cm–1 after the formation of the
nanohybrid. This plausibly indicated the oxidation of alkoxyl and
hydroxyl groups to carbonyl groups on reduction of Pd2+ and Ag+. The change in the O–H bending band of
CQDs after the formation of the nanohybrid seen at 1360 cm–1 further demonstrated the change in hydroxyl functional groups because
of the presence of the Pd–Ag hybrid particles. Further, the
sharp C–O (alkoxyl) stretching band at 1044 cm–1 and the oxirane C–O–C stretching band at 886 cm–1 of CQDs diminished in due course of complexation
and formation of the nanohybrid, undergoing transformation to C=O
groups as described before. These changes in the intensity and shifting
of the band positions in the nanohybrid clearly indicated the strong
interactions between CQDs and the bimetallic Pd–Ag hybrid phase.
Similar observations were reported by Dey et al.23a and Shen et al.25 These prominent
observations pointed toward the contribution of alkoxyl, carbonyl,
oxirane, and hydroxyl groups in the nanohybrid formation and thereby
provided ample evidence in favor of the presumed reduction and nanohybrid
formation mechanism.

EDX analysis confirmed the presence of
elements like C, O, Pd,
and Ag in the nanohybrid, with the corresponding wt % values of 42.35,
29.78, 17.72, and 10.15, respectively (Figure 1c). PXRD analysis results gave interesting
evidence regarding the physical structure of the nanohybrid (Figure 1d). The nanohybrid
displayed the characteristic broad peak of CQDs centered at 2θ
= 23° (d-spacing of 3.7 Å), indicating
the presence of CQDs. Moreover, the nanohybrid exhibited five sharp
diffractions indexed as (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes
of a face-centered-cubic (fcc) lattice with corresponding peaks at
2θ = 38.2° (d-spacing of 2.29 Å),
44.5° (d-spacing of 1.98 Å), 64.6°
(d-spacing of 1.40 Å), 77.5° (d-spacing of 1.19 Å), and 81.8° (d-spacing
of 1.14 Å), respectively. PdNPs and AgNPs are known to exhibit
the typical fcc lattice of Pd and Ag metals.12a Surprisingly, no characteristic diffraction peaks for pure Pd or
Ag were observed for the nanohybrid. This phenomenon suggested that
Ag entered into the Pd crystal lattice, merging together to form a
single crystalline Pd–Ag hybrid phase possibly during nucleation-oriented
growth over CQDs.12b,29 BET analysis revealed that the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the prepared
catalyst shows a type V isotherm and the surface area of the nanohybrid
to be 674.327 m2 g–1 (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information).

Morphological
characteristics of the nanohybrid including shape,
size, and particle distribution envisioned by TEM analysis and confirmed
the presence of the Pd–Ag nanohybrid particles supported over
CQDs. TEM images displayed near-spherical morphology and uniform particle
distribution of the nanohybrid, albeit with some amount of agglomeration
(Figure 2a). The Pd–Ag
nanohybrid particles (in red circles) nucleated upon CQDs (in yellow
circles), thereby forming a stable and supportive nanohybrid system
(Figure 2b). Statistical
analysis revealed that the size distribution lies between 2 and 6
nm, and the largest fraction of particles possessed sizes in the range
of 3–5 nm (Figure 2c). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of Pd–Ag@CQD
further showed the presence of lattice fringes (Figure 2d,e). Conversion of selected areas (in yellow
and red squares) into corresponding IFFT images revealed different
interplanar distances (inset). The interplanar distance of 0.364 nm
was attributed to lattice planes of CQDs, which is close to the (002)
crystallographic plane of CQDs, whereas the interplanar distances
of 0.185 and 0.145 nm were attributed to lattice planes of the Pd–Ag
nanohybrid phase, which is close to (200) and (220) planes of the
Pd–Ag hybrid.12a Selected area diffraction
(SAED) patterns of the nanohybrid are in good agreement with the crystalline
Pd–Ag nanohybrid phase, which were also consistent with PXRD
pattern results.

Catalytic Application of
the Pd–Ag@CQD Nanohybrid in
Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reaction
The catalytic
activity of the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid was evaluated in the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction. For this purpose, the coupling of 4-ethylphenylboronic
acid with 4-bromoanisole was chosen as the model reaction using ethanol–water
(1:1) as the solvent system and K2CO3 as the
base. 1 wt % of the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid, with respect to 4-ethylphenylboronic
acid, was employed as the catalyst. The reactions were performed at
room temperature under aerobic conditions without the addition of
any ligands or additives (Scheme 3). The reaction afforded 4-ethyl-4′-methoxy-1,1′-biphenyl
with a 70% yield in 4 h. For this reaction, an ethanol–water
mixture (1:1) provided a highly polar co-solvent system in which the
substrates were easily homogenized, and thus, it acts as a stable
dispersion medium for the nanohybrid catalyst. Moreover, the choice
of the ethanol–water solvent offered a neat and green reaction
medium. In similar lines, the choice of K2CO3 presented a mild, inexpensive, effective base necessary for the
cross-coupling reaction.

Scheme 3 Model Reaction for Pd–Ag@CQD-Catalyzed
Suzuki–Miyaura
Cross-Coupling
To study the effect
of the catalyst loading on the reaction rate
and its efficiency, the model reaction was utilized, and the results
are summarized in Table 1. From this study, it was observed that the catalyst loading is essential
for the reaction to proceed (entry 1). Also, it was seen that the
catalyst loading affected the reaction rate, in correlation with the
reaction time and the product yield (entry 2–5). Further, it
was found that catalytic loading of 5 wt % was the optimized amount
for the coupling reaction (entry 4), as a further increase in catalyst
loading to 7.5 wt % did not have any substantial increment in the
reaction rate and its efficiency (entry 5). Catalytic loading of 10
wt % eventually led to the decrease in the yield, with some amount
of agglomeration observed in the reaction medium (entry 6). This may
also be caused by adsorption of some amount of reactants on the surface
of the catalyst.

To determine
the applicability and limitation of the current procedure,
reactions of different aryl boronic acid derivatives with substituted/unsubstituted
aryl bromides and aryl chlorides were examined using the optimized
conditions. Aryl bromides/chlorides were chosen for this purpose as
the activation of C–Br or C–Cl bonds are tougher than
C–I bonds.2 The results are summarized
in Table 2.

c Isolated yield, purified by column
chromatography and authenticated by NMR analyses (Fig S4–S15
in the Supporting Information).

From the substrate study, it was
observed that rate of the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction depends on the nature of substituents on both
the aryl halides and aryl boronic acids. The presence of electron-releasing
substituents on the aryl boronic acid as well as on aryl halides required
less time to complete, whereas those with electron-withdrawing substituents
took a little longer duration for completion. This may be due to the
presence of polar electron-releasing moieties on the surface of the
nanohybrid catalyst (from CQDs), which facilitated better interactions
with the substrates having electron-releasing groups than those with
electron-withdrawing groups. Dey et al.23a and Borah et al.19a reported comparable
observations regarding the effect of substituents. In most of the
cases, the homo-coupling product was not observed and did not exceed
3% in some cases.

The reusability of the catalyst is very important
from the perspective
of green and sustainable chemistry. Accordingly, the catalyst was
screened for reusability by employing the model reaction for consecutive
runs and analyzed by gas chromatography (Figure 3, Table S2 of the Supporting Information). The procedure afforded completion of the reaction
in the comparable reaction time and the product yield during the first
three runs, as that for the fresh catalyst. The catalyst was found
to be reusable up to the third run without any loss of the catalytic
activity. However, the catalyst demonstrated some amount of agglomeration
in the reaction medium after the fourth run, with a slight loss in
catalytic activity as manifested by a decrease in the product yield.
This slight loss of activity can be attributed to the agglomeration
of the nanohybrid, leading to deactivation of the catalytic system
after several runs of the reaction and the recovery process. Similar
observations were made by Dey et al.,23a Borah et al.,19a and Moussa et al.12a regarding agglomeration of NPs in the reaction
medium on subsequent catalytic cycles. To verify any change in the
structure and morphology after undergoing several runs, the recovered
catalyst was analyzed by PXRD. The results, in general, hinted toward
an intact state and the structure of the catalyst, without much significant
changes, which are supported by the appearance of previously observed
diffraction patterns for the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid (Figure 4a). Also, the EDX
study of the recovered catalyst displayed almost the same elemental
composition as seen before (Figure 4b). In addition, the leaching of Pd and Ag in the reaction
medium was studied by ICP analysis (Table S3 of the Supporting Information). The study disclosed the leakage of
0.871 ppm Pd and 0.520 ppm Ag in the reaction mixture, amounting to
a loss of 0.058% Pd and 0.034% Ag from the total amount of the catalyst.
These results suggested the presence of trace amounts of Pd and Ag
soluble in the reaction medium; however, because the amount was less
than 1 ppm, the leakage can be treated as very minute.

The highest turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency
(TOF)
were found to be 752.3 and 12.53 min–1, respectively,
for Pd–Ag@CQDs for the cross-coupling reaction. Details on
calculation of TON and TOF are provided in the Supporting Information.

The mechanism of the C−C
cross coupling reactions catalyzed
by heterogeneous palladium catalysts is a subject of great scientific
interest, as to identify the exact species responsible for the catalysis.3 However, it is widely accepted that the mechanism
follows a heterogeneous catalytic cycle. The heterogeneity of the
catalyst was supported by using the hot filtration test, as discussed
in the Supporting Information, Figure S3;
however, there was a very miniature amount of leached metals in the
filtrate as detected by ICP analysis.

Study of the Catalytic
Role of the Components of the Pd–Ag@CQD
Nanohybrid in the Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reaction
From the catalyst optimization study and substrate study, it was
seen that the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction was greatly
enhanced by the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid in terms of the reaction
time and yield. To explain the basis of this enhancement, that is,
the role of the components in the nanohybrid system, the reaction
was emulated with different variants of the catalyst viz., CQDs, AgNP,
PdNPs, and the results are summarized in the Table 3. For this purpose, the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction of the aryl boronic acid derivative and aryl
chloride was chosen to be the model reaction. This is because, as
the reaction with aryl bromides was comparatively faster and easier,
the toughest reaction conditions, that is, with aryl chlorides, were
emulated for better understanding of the role of the catalyst in the
cross-coupling reaction.

From the study,
it was observed that the reaction did not proceed
in the presence of only CQDs as the catalyst (entry 1). A similar
observation was made when only AgNPs were used in catalytic amounts
(entry 2). Both of these initial observations can be attributed to
the inability of CQDs and AgNPs to singlehandedly catalyze the reaction.
On the other hand, when only PdNPs were used, the reaction proceeded
sluggishly, with a very low yield of 16% (entry 3). This can be accredited
to the difficulty in activation of the C–Cl bond of aryl chloride
under the current reaction conditions. Hence, this outcome necessitates
the presence of palladium for the reaction to proceed. Again, when
both PdNPs and AgNPs were used in tandem, a slightly better yield
of 22% was recorded (entry 4). This pointed toward the role of AgNPs
in assisting PdNPs for catalyzing the reaction and signified the catalytic
enhancement brought about by the combination of the two. The reaction
was not successful with combination of AgNPs and CQDs (entry 5), as
observed earlier. However, the combination of PdNPs and CQDs afforded
better results with a reduced reaction time and an increased yield
of 20% (entry 6). Hence, the presence of CQDs in tandem with PdNPs
resulted in the catalytic enhancement of the reaction too. Now, when
PdNPs, AgNPs, and CQDs were used together, the reaction time decreased
further, and the yield of 25% was recorded (entry 7). The outcome
suggested the synergistic ability of CQDs and AgNPs in assisting PdNPs
in the catalytic enhancement of the cross-coupling reaction. This
result was comparable to the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid system, which
recorded the minimum time with a maximum yield (entry 8).

Hence,
it can be suggested that Ag and CQDs played a pivotal role
in the stabilization and activation of Pd in the nanohybrid, thereby
providing crucial assistance during the catalytic process. The integration
of Pd with Ag in the nanohybrid augmented the activity of Pd by virtue
of synergistic metal–metal interactions, thereby making an
energetic electron transfer process feasible between them.30 Additionally, CQDs with their surface functional
moieties served as the reaction surface by means of secondary interactions
like π–π interactions, H-bonding, and so forth,
with the reactants, especially during the oxidative addition and transmetallation
steps (Scheme 4). The
rate-determining step in the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling
reaction, the oxidative addition step, may be accelerated by the activated
Pd species, leading to the enrichment of inherent catalytic activity
of the reaction. Furthermore, the energy released during electron
transfer to the surrounding environment probably contributed to the
enhancement of catalytic activity.30

Scheme 4 Synergistic Role of the Pd–Ag@CQD Nanohybrid in the Suzuki–Miyaura
Cross-Coupling Reaction
Thus, overall, these observations clearly exhibited that
the enhanced
activity in the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction might
be attributed to the synergistic effect between Pd–Ag hybrid
NPs existing adjacent to each other, supported over CQDs.

Conclusion
Photo-activated CQDs can be used as the reducing and stabilizing
agent for synthesis of the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid by a facile
and expeditious single-step protocol. Structural analyses confirmed
the formidable structural integration of CQDs with Pd–Ag hybrid
NPs in the nanohybrid system. Most interestingly, the Pd–Ag@CQD
nanohybrid served as an effective heterogeneous catalyst for the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction under a normal atmosphere and ligand-free
conditions. The synergistic action of the components in the nanohybrid
induced catalytic enhancement of the cross-coupling reaction in terms
of short reaction times and high yields. The heterogeneous nature
of the nanohybrid enabled catalyst recovery and reusability.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
Palladium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA), silver nitrate (Merck, India), and dextrose anhydrous (Merck,
India) were utilized as received. CQDs were prepared by microwave
irradiation after a slight modification in the reported procedure
(as described in the Supporting Information, Scheme S1).24 Other chemicals and solvents
were of reagent grade and used without further purification.

Synthesis
of the Pd–Ag@CQD Nanohybrid
Pd–Ag@CQDs
were synthesized by a facile UV-light-assisted reduction process by
employing CQDs as the biobased reducing as well as stabilizing agent.
In a typical experiment, 5 mL of 10 mM Pd(OAc)2 solution
and 5 mL of 10 mM AgNO3 solution in ethanol were taken
in a round-bottomed flask. Ten milliliters of as-prepared CQDs (concentration
of CQDs was 24 mg/mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and it was
stirred under UV light at a wavelength of 365 nm for 1 h. The formation
of the Pd–Ag@CQD nanohybrid was indicated by a change in the
color of the solution from greenish brown to metallic brown, along
with the disappearance of the green luminescence of CQDs with advancing
reaction time. The nanohybrid was collected, centrifuged at 5000 rpm,
and washed five times with ethanol–water to remove the excess
metal salts and unbound CQDs. The obtained nanohybrid was dispersed
in ethanol by ultrasonication and stored under ambient conditions.
For structural analysis, the nanohybrid was oven-dried at 45 °C
for 24 h under vacuum.

General Procedure for the Suzuki–Miyaura
Cross-Coupling
Reaction
Aryl boronic acid (0.255 mmol) and aryl halide (0.25
mmol) were taken in a 50 mL round-bottomed flask and dissolved in
2 mL of EtOH–H2O (1:1) as the solvent. To this reaction
mixture, a 2 mL ethanolic dispersion of the 5 wt % Pd–Ag@CQD
nanohybrid (wrt aryl boronic acid) was added, followed by the addition
of K2CO3 (1.0 mmol). The reactants were stirred
under room temperature, and the progress of the reaction was monitored
by thin-layer chromatography. After completion of the reaction, the
catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation
at 5000 rpm, washed five times with ethanol–water, and dried
under vacuum. The crude reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl
acetate (10 mL × 3), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, followed by drying under reduced pressure. Isolation of
the desired product was achieved by column chromatography using hexane
and ethyl acetate as the eluent. The products were identified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses as provided
in the Supporting Information.
