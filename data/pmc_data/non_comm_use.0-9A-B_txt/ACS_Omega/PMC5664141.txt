We recently demonstrated
the far-red light-activatable prodrug
of paclitaxel (PTX), Pc-(L-PTX)2. Upon illumination with
a 690 nm laser, Pc-(L-PTX)2 showed combinational cell killing
from rapid photodynamic therapy damage by singlet oxygen, followed
by sustained chemotherapy effects from locally released PTX. However,
its high lipophilicity (log D7.4 >
3.1)
caused aggregation in aqueous solutions and has nonselectivity toward
cancer cells. To solve these important problems, we prepared folic
acid (FA)-conjugated and photoactivatable prodrugs of PTX with a polyethylene
glycol (PEG) spacer of various chain lengths: FA-PEGn-Pc-L-PTX [n = 0 (0k, 5), ∼23
(1k, 7a), ∼45 (2k, 7b), ∼80
(3.5k, 7c), or ∼114 (5k, 7d)]. The
PEGylated prodrugs 7a–d had a much improved hydrophilicity
compared with the non-PEGylated prodrug, Pc-(L-PTX)2. As
the PEG length increased, the hydrophilicity of the prodrug increased
(log D7.4 values: 1.28, 0.09, −0.24,
and −0.59 for 1k, 2k, 3.5k, and 5k PEG prodrugs, respectively).
Fluorescence spectral data suggested that the PEGylated prodrugs had
good solubility in the culture medium at lower concentrations (<1–2
μM), but showed fluorescence quenching due to limited solubility
at higher concentrations (>2 μM). Dynamic light scattering
indicated
that all of the prodrugs formed nanosized particles in both phosphate-buffered
saline and culture medium at a concentration of 5 μM. The PEG
length affected both nonspecific and folate receptor (FR)-mediated
uptake of the prodrugs. The enhanced cellular uptake was observed
for the prodrugs with medium-sized PEGs (1k, 2k, or 3.5k) in FR-positive
SKOV-3 cells, but not for the prodrugs with no PEG or with the longest
PEG (5k), which suggests the optimal range of PEG length around 1k–3.5k
for effective uptake of our prodrug system. Consistent with the cellular
uptake pattern, medium-sized PEGylated prodrugs showed more potent
phototoxic activity (IC50s, ∼130 nM) than prodrugs
with no PEG or the longest PEG (IC50, ∼400 nM).
In conclusion, we have developed far-red light-activatable prodrugs
with improved water solubility and FR-targeting properties compared
with the nontargeted prodrug.

Introduction
Photodynamic therapy
(PDT), a clinically approved and minimally
invasive technique, has received great attention as a promising method
for the treatment of several types of cancers1−4 and other diseases, such as acne
and neovascular age-related macular degeneration.5−8 Upon activation of the photosensitizer
with the appropriate wavelength of light, reactive and cytotoxic singlet
oxygen is produced.9,10 Singlet oxygen has a very short
half-life (∼10–320 ns) and a short diffusion distance
(<270 nm) in biological systems.11−13 Therefore, it is difficult
to kill cancer cells completely and prevent recurrence.14,15 To overcome this limitation, we developed prodrugs in which the
photosensitizers were conjugated with anticancer agents via a far-red
light-cleavable amino acrylate linker (Figure 1).16−20 The anticancer drugs are released only at the tumor site after illumination
with far-red light, avoiding the systemic side effects from chemotherapy
and simultaneously killing cancer cells that survived PDT damage.
However, aggregation due to higher lipophilicity and nonspecific uptake
into normal cells is still an issue.

Figure 1 Nontargeted (a,b)17,18 and targeted (c)19 prodrugs of CA4 previously
synthesized by our group.

To improve the selectivity to cancer cells, we selected a
tumor-targeting
group, folic acid (FA), which recognizes the folate receptors (FRs).
FRs are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface receptors
that tightly bind to the FA or folate.21,22 Several researchers
have reported that the FRs are overexpressed in numerous types of
human cancer, such as ovarian, breast, brain, colorectal, epithelial,
and lung cancer, whereas the expression is limited in normal cells
or tissues.23−28 Because of the vast difference in the number of FRs in tumors and
normal cells or tissues, FRs can be exploited to target folate-conjugated
drugs or imaging agents to FR-positive tumors and prevent cellular
uptake in normal cells or tissues.29−33 Once the folate tightly binds to the FR receptor,
the folate-conjugated drugs or imaging agents can be internalized
through endocytosis. Thus, incorporation of FA into the molecule is
a popular way to selectively target FR-positive tumor cells. Numerous
FA-conjugated prodrugs have been prepared to target FR-overexpressing
tumors.34,35

Similarly, inclusion of a polyethylene
glycol (PEG) spacer is a
popular strategy to increase hydrophilicity and avoid aggregation.
Introduction of the PEG spacer increases the hydrophilicity and improves
the pharmacokinetic profile of the prodrugs36−40 by reducing kidney elimination, prolonging the plasma
circulation time of the prodrugs,41 and
protecting the prodrugs from proteolytic enzymes.42 In addition, PEGylation provides passive tumor-targeting
via enhanced permeability and retention effect.43,44 PEG can be modified with folates that are recognized selectively
by the FR in tumor cells to acquire receptor-mediated active tumor-targeting.45−48 There were several reports that PEGylated prodrugs with hydrophilic
PEG or PEG-folate and hydrophobic therapeutic molecules were able
to self-assemble to form micelles or aggregates because of their amphiphilic
nature.49−53

Previously, our group prepared nontargeted and folate-targeted
light-activatable prodrugs of combretastatin A-4 (CA4; Figure 1).16−19 The targeted prodrugs with the
appropriate PEG chain length (2k) showed an FR-mediated uptake, selective
cytotoxicity, and a more efficient antitumor activity than the nontargeted
prodrug.19 Similarly, we successfully showed
that the nontargeted far-red light-activatable prodrug of paclitaxel
(PTX), upon illumination with 690 nm light, released free PTX and
demonstrated promising phototoxicity in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells.20 On the basis of these studies, we were determined
to develop folate conjugates of PTX, one of the most popular, clinically
approved anticancer drugs, with modifications to a previously prepared,
nontargeted, far-red light-activatable PTX prodrug (Figure 2a,b). To improve its selectivity
toward FR-positive cancer cells (Figure 2c), we replaced one molecule of PTX with
an FR-targeting group, FA. FA was conjugated to the photosensitizer
either directly or via the PEG spacer.

nontargeted prodrug of PTX (a) and folate
conjugates of PTX, with or without PEGs, reported in this manuscript
(b). FR-mediated cellular uptake and biological effects upon illumination
with 690 nm light (c).

In the present study, we prepared five folate conjugates
of PTX,
of which one was non-PEGylated (direct conjugation) and the other
four were PEGylated with PEG spacers of different chain lengths (1k,
2k, 3.5k, and 5k). All of the prepared prodrugs were evaluated for
in vitro cellular uptake in FR-positive SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells
with or without excess FA. Furthermore, we tested the dark (without
light) and phototoxicity (690 nm) of the prepared prodrugs to determine
the cytotoxic effects in SKOV-3 cells in vitro. As these prodrugs
are polymeric conjugates of the hydrophobic PTX and tend to self-assemble
in aqueous solutions, we evaluated the particle size distribution
in both phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and a complete medium.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated
Folate Conjugates
of PTX and Phthalocyanine (Pc)
We prepared the folate conjugates
of PTX by conjugating silicon Pc with PTX on one side and FA, with
or without the PEG spacer, on the other side (Figure 2 and Scheme 1). We used PEG of the following molecular weights (chain
lengths): 1k, 2k, 3.5k, and 5k. As our previously reported20 nontargeted prodrugs of PTX were highly lipophilic
and tended to aggregate, one of our goals was to improve its solubility
and prevent aggregation. The PEG chain length affected the physicochemical
properties and the cellular uptake of molecules. Therefore, we selected
various chain lengths of PEGs to find the appropriate size for a better
cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in our system. As reported in our
previous study,20 the most reactive 2′-OH
of PTX, which has a critical role in binding with tubulin,54 was chosen to conjugate with Pc. First, we conjugated
the single PTX molecule with Pc by reacting an equimolar concentration
of compound 1 and PTX propiolate (2) in
tetrahydrofuran (THF) to get a mixture of disubstituted and monosubstituted
PTX derivative (3). The desired compound 3 was obtained in 41% yield after purification with silica gel chromatography.
Non-PEGylated folate conjugate (FA-Pc-L-PTX) (5) was
prepared by directly reacting compound 3 with the activated
FA. Briefly, FA was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in the
presence of N,N’-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) for 16 h at
room temperature (rt) and was then treated with compound 3. The reaction was stirred at rt for 24 h to obtain the FA-conjugated
derivative 5 in 53% yield.

Conjugates of PTX
Reagents and conditions: (i)
THF, 2 h, rt, 41%; (ii) (a) FA, DCC, NHS, anhydrous DMF, 16 h (b)
Et3N, anhydrous DMF, 24 h, rt, 53%; (iii) diglycolic anhydride,
anhydrous DMF, rt, 36 h, 70%; and (iv) (a) DCC, NHS, anhydrous DMF,
20–24 h and (b) 6a–d, Et3N,
36–48 h, 29–45%.

For the preparation
of PEGylated folate conjugates (FA-PEG1k–5k-Pc-L-PTX)
(7a–d), compound 3 was converted
to acid derivative 4 by reacting
it with an equimolar concentration of diglycolic anhydride in dimethylformamide
(DMF) to get compound 4 in 70% yield. Compound 4 was then activated by reacting it with DCC and NHS for 20–24
h and was finally conjugated with the folate PEG amine (FA-PEGn-NH2) (6a–d) in the presence of triethylamine (Et3N) for 36–48
h. PEGylated folate prodrugs were obtained in 29–45% yield.
The prodrugs were characterized with proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR), ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis), fluorescence,
and mass spectroscopies. In 1H NMR (Figure S14), we observed the changes in the chemical shift
for the protons in the diglycolic linker, adjacent to the conjugation,
from 3.9 to 3.7 ppm, which is due to the reduction in the deshielding
effect of free carboxylic acid after conjugation.55 Similarly, after conjugation, for methylene proton in the
folate PEG amine, there was a shift from 2.8 to 3.2–3.3 ppm
(overlapped with H2O from the solvent). The pattern was
similar for the other prodrugs.

Photophysical Properties
and log D7.4 Values
UV–vis
absorption and fluorescence properties
of the prepared PEGylated and nonPEGylated folate conjugates (5 and 7a–d) were measured in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) (Table 1 and Figure 3a,c). Experiments
were performed in duplicate (Figure S23a,c). The UV–vis spectrum of Pc was not affected by the conjugation
with PTX and folate PEGs. All of the folate conjugates showed Pc’s
typical sharp Q-band at 678 nm. Similarly, the fluorescence spectra
showed the typical pattern of Pc with λflu at 680
for all folate conjugates. This finding clearly indicates that the
prepared folate conjugates retained the optical imaging capability
of Pc. However, both absorbance and fluorescence (Figures 3 and S23) for all folate conjugates in PBS were reduced compared to those
in DMSO. This is due to the aggregation of folate conjugates in PBS
as compared to DMSO.

in DMSO (c) and PBS (d) of all folate conjugates at 2 μM concentration.

Partition coefficients,
as anticipated, showed that the hydrophilicity
of the folate conjugates increased on increasing the PEG chain length
from 1k to 5k. Folate conjugate 7d, with the longest
chain length, showed the lowest log D7.4 (−0.59), whereas folate conjugate 7a, with the
shortest chain length, showed the highest log D7.4 (1.28). Folate conjugate 5, without PEG, was
the most lipophilic, log D7.4 = 2.22.
Compared with the nontargeted prodrug [Pc-(L-PTX)2, log D7.4 > 3.1], all of the folate conjugates,
and
in particular, the PEGylated folate conjugates showed much improved
hydrophilicity.

Influence of the PEG Chain Length on the
Cellular Uptake of
Folate Conjugates (5 and 7a–d)
From the cellular uptake study (Figure 4) of folate conjugates 5 and 7a–d to SKOV-3, we found that 7a–c showed a better cellular uptake than 5 and 7d. At 24 h (Figure 4f), there was more than 12-fold increase in the intracellular prodrug
accumulation of 7a–7c compared with prodrug 5. The introduction of the PEG chain length from 1k to 3.5k
(7a–c) enhanced the cellular uptake; however,
the uptake was dramatically reduced when the PEG chain length reached
5k (prodrug 7d).

Figure 4 Time-dependent cellular uptake (a–e)
of folate conjugates 5 and 7a–d and
total uptake of folate
conjugates 5 and 7a–d at 24 h (f)
with or without excess (0.5 mM) FA.

The folate conjugates were expected to be internalized by
FRs on
the cell membrane. By adding FA (0.5 mM) to the culture medium, we
expected a competition between FA and FA-conjugated prodrugs for the
same receptors. 7a, 7b, and 7c demonstrated a decreased uptake of 55, 62, and 69%, respectively,
in the presence of FA (Figure 4). This finding indicates that >50% of the uptake of 7a, 7b, and 7c was mediated through
FRs. By contrast, for prodrug 5, with no PEG spacer,
no difference was observed in the cellular uptake, with or without
FA. Similarly, there was little decrease (22%) in the cellular uptake
of 7d, with a 5k PEG, upon adding FA. Our results showed
that the optimal PEG chain length for cellular uptake is around 1k–3.5k
(7a–c).

The low uptake of prodrug 5 might be due to its high
aggregation in aqueous solutions. It was the most lipophilic (log D7.4 = 2.22) among the prodrugs. Its aggregation
was demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Although all of the prodrugs
have the same fluorophore (Pc), the fluorescence of prodrug 5 in PBS was mostly quenched compared with other prodrugs
(fluorescence: 238 950 vs 1 056 130 arb unit, Figures 3d and S23d). Furthermore, we compared the concentration-dependent
fluorescence of prodrugs 5, 7b, and 7d in a complete medium (0.039–40 μM) using a
plate reader (Figures 5 and S24). The fluorescence of prodrug 5 was much lower compared with those of prodrugs 7b and 7d, supporting the observation that prodrug 5 was more aggregated than 7b and 7d, even in the complete medium. Prodrugs 7b and 7d showed fluorescence quenching at higher concentrations
(>5 μM).

Figure 5 Concentration-dependent (40–0.039 μM) fluorescence
of folate conjugates 5, 7b, and 7d in the complete medium.

The low cellular uptake of prodrug 7d is probably
due to both high water solubility and steric hindrance by longer PEG
spacers. We speculate that an excessively long PEG chain (5k for 7d) not only hindered the interaction of the FA moiety and
FRs, reducing FR-mediated uptake, but also rendered prodrug 7d too hydrophilic, reducing the nonspecific uptake. It was
reported that PEG conjugates with a longer chain length (5k) could
not be taken up by the cells, whereas PEG conjugates with a shorter
chain length (2k) were able to enter the cells.56 Therefore, selection of PEG with an appropriate chain length
is vital for attaining a better cellular uptake.

In vivo optical
imaging was performed to see the time-dependent
biodistribution of folate conjugates, 5, 7a, and 7d, in tumor-bearing mice (Figure S26). The images suggest that compound 7b has better tumor localization compared to 5 and 7d, consistent with the in vitro uptake.

Characterization
of Self-Assembled Aggregates or Micelles of
Folate Conjugates (5 and 7a–d)
Some studies showed that hydrophobic compounds (e.g., PTX) attached
to the polymer, making amphiphilic PTX-polymers, have a tendency to
form self-assembled aggregates or micelles in aqueous solution and
affect the cellular uptake.52,53 Thus, we analyzed the
particle size distribution of all targeted prodrugs (5 and 7a–d) in aqueous solutions, PBS, and complete
medium (Table 2 and Figure 6).

At 5 μM, the average diameters
were around 100–150
nm in the medium and 170–200 nm in PBS. The diameters were
slightly smaller in the medium than in PBS, but were still much larger
than what we expected from their molecular weights (approximately
2000–7000 Da). Self-assembled micelles or aggregates were stable
in the complete medium and PBS for at least 7 days. We also measured
the zeta potential (zp) of the targeted prodrugs (5 and 7a–d). The zp values were similar (−10 to 20
mV) for all prodrugs, indicating that the nanoparticles were in an
unstable suspension (less than −30 mV).57 Moreover, the zp of prodrugs 5 and 7d showed more fluctuation than those of 7a–c during
the 7 day observation. All of the folate conjugates formed self-assembled
aggregates or micelles in aqueous solutions.

Furthermore, the
fluorescence of 7b was measured in
different solvents using the plate reader (Figure S25). We found that the fluorescence of 7b was
highly quenched in PBS, indicating that the micelle or aggregate formation
is higher in PBS than in other solvents (DMSO, complete medium, 5%
Tween 80 in PBS). The fluorescence was higher at low concentrations
of <5 μM in the complete medium than it was in DMSO, whereas
the fluorescence decreased as the concentration increased. We expected
that the prodrug would mostly remain as a monomer in DMSO. However,
the fluorescence was not higher than that observed in the complete
medium. As was previously reported,58 we
hypothesized that the low fluorescence of 7b in DMSO
was probably because of the quenching of the singlet oxygen state
of Pc through the photoinduced electron transfer process. Therefore,
we protonated 7b in DMSO solution with acid (HCl) and
measured the fluorescence. We found that the fluorescence increased
dramatically with protonation. This finding confirms that the prodrugs
remain mostly in the monomeric form, without fluorescence quenching,
in acidic solution. Comparing the fluorescence of prodrug 7b in the complete medium, DMSO with HCl, and 5% Tween 80 in PBS, fluorescence
was significantly reduced in the complete medium, which is probably
due to quenching by the formation of micelles. This result further
supports our observation that all of the prodrugs form micelles in
the complete medium.

Dark and Phototoxicity of Folate Conjugates
(5 and 7a–d)
The folate
conjugates were evaluated
for cytotoxicity after illumination (phototoxicity; Figure 7b) with a 690 nm laser. After
illumination, 7a–c demonstrated higher phototoxicity
than 5 and 7d, which was consistent with
the findings from the uptake study (Figure 4). The IC50 values of 7a–c (124–137 nM) was about 3 times less than those of prodrugs 5 and 7d (415 and 406 nM, respectively, Table S1). Furthermore, prodrugs 7a–c showed a higher maximum inhibition (Emax = 90%) than prodrug 5 (80%). Emax and IC50 values for 7a, 7b, and 7c were similar. Notably, prodrug 7b showed a broader dose–response curve with a hill
slope of 0.8 (Table S1) compared with prodrugs 7a and 7c, suggesting that prodrug 7c produces antitumor activity over a wide concentration range.

Figure 7 Dark (a) and
phototoxicity (b) profiles of folate conjugates (5 and 7a–d) against SKOV-3 ovarian cancer
cells. The experimental data were obtained from MTT assays 72 h post-treatment.

Without illumination (dark), low
toxicity was observed for all
folate conjugates (5 and 7a–d). More
than 90% of cells survived after 72 h of incubation with 7a–d (1k–5k) at a concentration of 500 nM (Figure 7a). For non-PEGylated prodrug 5, 40% of cells were killed at a concentration of 1000 nM after 72
h of incubation.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully
prepared folate conjugates of PTX with
(or without) PEG spacers of various chain lengths ranging from 1k
to 5k. As observed from the log D7.4 values,
the PEGylation of far-red light-activatable PTX prodrug has increased
the hydrophilicity, thereby reducing the tendency to aggregate randomly.
Another advantage is the amphiphilic nature of these prodrugs. Because
of the presence of both hydrophobic (PTX) and hydrophilic (FA-PEG)
moieties, the prodrugs can self-assemble to form micelles, which could
be advantageous as a drug-delivery system for PTX. Moreover, PTX can
be replaced with other therapeutic agents as needed. We evaluated
the cellular uptake of the prepared prodrugs in SKOV-3 cells in vitro.
The results showed that the uptake was FR-mediated, which enables
these conjugates to selectively target FR-positive tumors. In addition,
we found that the optimal chain length for the FR-mediated uptake
lies between 1k and 3.5k. By conjugating the bulky Pc group to the
essential 2′-OH of PTX, we were able to reduce its cytotoxicity,
as seen in the results from the dark toxicity study, where more than
90% of SKOV-3 cells survived after 72 h of incubation with folate
PEG conjugates (7a–d). Furthermore, we tested
the phototoxicity of these prodrugs, and the results were consistent
with the results of the uptake study. Prodrugs 7a–c showed higher phototoxicity than 5 and 7d. From these findings, we can clearly conclude that phototoxicity
was dependent upon the cellular uptake of these conjugates. Overall,
prodrug 7b, with a PEG spacer of 2k, showed a better
FR-mediated uptake and cell survival inhibition at a wide concentration
range compared with prodrugs 7a and 7c.
Therefore, we have selected prodrug 7b for further studies.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instruments
All reagents and solvents
were of analytical grade and used without further purification. They
were obtained from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, VWR, USA,
and Fisher Scientific, USA). Starting materials (FA-conjugated PEG
amines 6a–d) were obtained from Nanocs. The dialysis
membrane (Spectra/Por 7 Standard RC) was purchased from Spectrum Laboratories,
Inc. (cat # 132104 and 132108). High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) grade solvents were purchased from Pharmco-AAPER. An analytical
thin-layer chromatography instrument was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(silica gel matrix on an aluminum plate, cat # Z193291) and was used
to monitor the reaction, either with UV or ninhydrin staining. Column
chromatography was carried out in 40–63 μm (230–400
mesh) silica gel purchased from SiliCycle, Inc. (cat # R10030B). Gel
permeation chromatography was performed on a Sephadex G15 (cat # 17-0020-01)
or G25 (cat # 17-0032-01) medium obtained from GE Healthcare Life
Sciences. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer.
The data were analyzed using iNMR (version 5.4.2), and the chemical
shifts were calibrated according to the residual solvent peaks. Chemical
shifts (δ) were recorded in ppm with coupling constants (J) in hertz. We used an Agilent 1260 series HPLC system
(Agilent Technologies, USA) and a BDS Hypersil C18 column (250 ×
4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size) with a Pinnacle DB C18 guard column
(10 × 4 mm, 5 μm particle size) to evaluate the purity
of compounds. We recorded the UV–vis absorption spectra using
UV–vis LAMBDA 25 (PerkinElmer) and a 10 mm optical path length
quartz cuvette. The fluorescence was recorded on a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog
fluorometer from Horiba Scientific. High-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) analysis was done using an AB SCIEX QSTAR Elite hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight
mass spectrometer at the CORE facility of OUHSC. Human ovarian cancer
cells (SKOV-3) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
and used for all in vitro experiments. All reagents for cell culture
were purchased from Invitrogen (Waltham, MA). Cells were maintained
in the culture medium [McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL penicillin G, 50 μg/mL streptomycin,
and 1.0 μg/mL Fungizone]. Cells were incubated at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 incubator (Sanyo MCO-18AIC-UV).

Synthesis of
Pc-L-PTX (3)
Compound 1 (319.5
mg, 0.40 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added to 150 mL of
dry THF in a round-bottom flask and was stirred for 10 min in a N2 atmosphere. Compound 2 (362.3 mg, 0.40 mmol,
1.0 equiv) dissolved in 50 mL of dry THF was then added dropwise into
a vigorously stirred solution of 1 over 1.5 h and was
then allowed to stir for an additional 30 min at rt. The reaction
mixture was evaporated under a reduced pressure, and the crude product
was purified with silica gel column chromatography using dichloromethane

FA (19.4
mg, 0.044 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (3 mL) under sonication.
After complete dissolution, DCC (10.9 mg, 0.052 mmol) was added, followed
by NHS (6.07 mg, 0.052 mmol) at rt. The reaction mixture was stirred
for 16 h at rt. The white precipitate was removed by filtration through
a 0.2 μm filter. To an activated solution of FA was added a
solution of compound 3 (50.0 mg, 0.029 mmol) in anhydrous
DMF (0.5 mL), followed by Et3N (12.2 μL, 0.088 mmol)
slowly at rt. The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 24 h. The
compound was purified by passing through Sephadex G-15, using DMF
as the eluent. It was then dialyzed [molecular weight cutoff (MWCO
1000)] in DMF (24 h), followed by DCM (20 h). After dialysis in DCM,
the solution was concentrated and further crashed out in cold ether
to obtain compound 5 (33 mg, 52.9%) as a dark green solid.

UV–Vis and Fluorescence
Measurement
Concentrations
of all prodrugs were adjusted with the UV–vis spectrum based
upon the extinction coefficient of compound 4 (Figure S22). UV–vis and fluorescence spectra
in DMSO were measured at a 2 μM concentration. Fluorescence
was measured using 0.6 mL of the sample. The sample was excited at
605 nm with a slit width of 8 nm. Emission was recorded from 640–680
nm with a slit width of 5 nm. Both UV–vis and fluorescence
spectra were normalized at 800 nm. Concentration-dependent fluorescence
was measured using a plate reader (SpectraMax Gemini EM, Molecular
Devices) with an excitation wavelength of 605 nm and emission at 680
nm. The sample volume used was 200 μL.

log D7.4 Determination
log D7.4 for all of the folate conjugates
(5 and 7a–d) was determined using
the previously reported method.19,20 Briefly, DMSO stocks
of prodrugs were prepared in 5 mM concentrations. n-Octanol and PBS were presaturated with PBS and n-octanol, respectively. Ten microliters of DMSO stock was added to
presaturated n-octanol and PBS (1 mL each) in 2 mL
Eppendorf tubes. The mixture was then vortexed for 30 min. After that,
it was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min (5, 7a, and 7b), 15 min (7c), or 30 min (7d) and was kept in the dark to stand for phase separation.
Once there was a clear phase separation, both layers were collected
in different vials. Fifty microliters of the sample from each layer
was diluted to 3 mL with DMSO, and UV–vis spectrum was measured.
log D was measured as the log ratio of the absorbance
in octanol to absorbance in PBS: log D7.4 = log[octanol Absmax/PBS Absmax].

Cellular Uptake of Folate
Conjugates on SKOV-3 Cells
SKOV-3 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 10 000
cells/well in 180 μL of the complete medium and were incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h. The 4 mM stock solutions of folate conjugates
in DMSO were diluted to 50 μM with the complete medium before
the solutions were added to the wells. The diluted solutions (20 μL)
were added to each well to achieve a final concentration of 5 μM
per well.

To determine whether the uptake of the conjugates
was mediated through FRs, additional uptake assays were performed
under the same conditions with 0.5 mM FA. Ten thousand SKOV-3 cells
in 96-well plates were preincubated with 0.5 mM FA. After 1 h, the
diluted conjugate solutions were added to each well to achieve a final
concentration of 5 μM per well. After incubation for 0, 1, 3,
6, 9, 16, and 24 h, the medium was collected to quantify the extracellular
concentration of conjugates with 10x dilution with DMSO. DMSO solution
(200 μL) containing 10% of the medium was added to each well
to lyse the cells. The cell lysate was then used to determine the
intracellular concentration of conjugates. The extracellular and intracellular
prodrug concentrations were determined by fluorescence measurement
of the diluted medium and cell lysate. The prodrug concentration was
quantified by its fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence plate
reader (SpectraMax Gemini EM, Molecular Devises) with excitation at
605 nm and emission at 680 nm and a bottom reading option. Data were
analyzed using SoftMax Pro software version 5.4.1.

Size Measurement
and Stability of Folate Conjugates (5 and 7a–d) in PBS and Complete Medium
Self-assembled aggregates or
micelles of folate conjugates (5 and 7a–d) in the aqueous solution were
characterized by measuring their hydrodynamic diameter, zp, and PDI
via the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method. The size and zp were
measured at a concentration of 5 μM at 37 °C. The measurements
were carried out on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Dark and Phototoxicity
Study
The cytotoxicity of all
conjugates was evaluated under both dark and illuminated conditions.
For the dark toxicity assay, SKOV-3 cells (5000 cells/well) were seeded
on 96-well plates and then incubated for 24 h. Four millimolar stock
solutions of conjugates in DMSO were diluted to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0,
and 10 μM in the complete medium. Twenty microliters of diluted
solutions were added to each well (180 μL), and the plates were
gently shaken using an orbital shaker for 30 min in the dark. The
plates were incubated for another 3 days in the dark at 37 °C.

For phototoxicity assays, cells were prepared in the same way as
cells used in the dark toxicity assays. After adding the conjugates
and incubating for 24 h, the medium containing drugs that were not
taken up into cells was removed. The cell monolayers were washed three
times with PBS, and 200 μL of fresh medium was added to each
well. The plates, without lids, were placed on an orbital shaker (Lab-Line,
Barnstead International) and illuminated using a diode laser (690
nm) at 5.6 mW/cm2 for 30 min to achieve a light dose of
10 J/cm2. Then, the plates were placed back into the incubator
for another 72 h. After the incubation, the MTT assay was performed
as described previously.20

The concentration–cytotoxicity
relationships for targeted
conjugates were analyzed with the sigmoidal Hill Equation using the
nonlinear least squares regression (Prism, Version 7.02, GraphPad
Software, Inc. CA). The analysis provided relevant pharmacodynamic
parameters (Emax, IC50, and Hill slope), where Emax is
the maximum cytotoxicity, IC50 is the drug concentration
producing 50% Emax, and Hill slope represents the steepness of the
curves.
