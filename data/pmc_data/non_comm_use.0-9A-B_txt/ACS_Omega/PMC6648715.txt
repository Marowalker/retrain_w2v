In situ methods for
the sequestration of perfluorooctyl-1-sulfonate (PFOS) that are based
on PFOS binding to polyquaternium polymers were reported previously,
providing an approach to immobilize and concentrate PFOS in situ.
To apply these methods in real life, the concentrations of polymers
that permit efficient sequestration must be determined. This is only
possible if the stoichiometry and strength of PFOS binding to polyquaternium
polymers are known. Here, we report on the use of fluorous-phase ion-selective
electrodes (ISEs) to determine the equilibrium constants characterizing
binding of PFOS to poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin)
and poly(diallyldimethylammonium) in simulated groundwater and in
soil suspensions. We introduce a new method to interpret potentiometric
data for surfactant binding to the charged repeat unit of these polyions
by combining a 1:1 binding model with the ISE response model. This
allows for straightforward prediction and fitting of experimental
potentiometric data in one step. Data fit the binding model for poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) chloride
in soil-free conditions and in the presence of soil from Tinker Air
Force Base. When the total PFOS concentration in a soil system is
known, knowledge of these PFOS binding characteristics permits quantitative
prediction of the mobile (free) and polymer-bound fractions of PFOS
as a function of the concentrations of the polyquaternium polymer.
Because the technique reported here is based on the selective in situ
determination of the free ionic surfactant, we expect it to be similarly
useful for determining the sequestration of a variety of other ionic
pollutants.

==== Body
Introduction
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFASs) are compounds in which all or the majority of the
hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine.1 They typically comprise a long hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl chain
(C4–C16), which makes them chemically
very stable2,3 and strongly hydrophobic.4 These unique properties led to the extensive use of PFASs
in industrial and consumer products.5,6 Consequently,
thousands of tons of PFASs have been produced annually since the 1950s.7 It was only in 2001 that the distribution of
some of these PFASs in the environment all across the globe was discovered.8 In particular, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS)
has been found to be one of the most prevalent PFASs in the environment,
leading to health advisories for drinking water by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and much continued study.6,7,9 Because the elimination half-life of PFOS
in humans is 5.4 years, the removal of even trace concentrations of
this compound from the environment is important.7,10

Numerous studies have been conducted to determine the best strategies
for PFOS sequestration or degradation, including sorptive removal,11−13 flocculation,14 and oxidative,15 reductive,16 thermal,17 and microbial degradation.18 One of the approaches for in situ sequestration of PFOS
from groundwater is based on binding of PFOS to positively charged
functional groups.14 Polyquaternium polymers,
which are polycationic polymers that are often added to water to remove
organic and inorganic anions by coagulation,19 are also suited for PFOS sequestration. Advantages of their use
are their low cost, the ability to inject these polymers as solutions
into the subsurface, the rapid reduction in aqueous phase PFOS, and
the in situ application.20 Because there
are currently no efficient techniques available for in situ destruction
of PFOS, polymer sequestrants are an attractive approach to stop expanding
PFAS plumes, effectively immobilizing PFOS.

Two polyquaternium
polymers have been used to bind PFOS by electrostatic and nonpolar
interactions.20,21 Importantly, it was shown that
these polyquaternium polymers bind to Ottawa sand and to soil from
Tinker Air Force Base (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma), which immobilizes
the PFOS–polymer aggregates and thereby results in effective
containment. Although the sequestration of PFOS to Ottawa sand-bound
polyquaternium polymers was studied to determine the quantity of PFOS
that can be retained,20 a quantitative
understanding of PFOS binding to these polymers and to polymer–soil
aggregates under environmental conditions has been lacking. Therefore,
to understand model and design remediation strategies that use polyquaternium
polymers as PFOS sequestrants, the binding interactions between PFOS
and these polycations have been studied in this work.

Interactions
of nonfluorinated surfactants and polymers have been studied since
the early 1970’s.22−28 A few of these investigations implemented ion-selective electrodes
(ISEs) as the chemical sensors to determine the fraction of freely
dissolved surfactants coexisting with surfactants bound to polyelectrolytes.25−27 Because ISEs measure selectively only the activity of freely dissolved
ions and allow for in situ measurements even in turbid soil suspensions
where many spectroscopic techniques fail, they are an excellent choice
for such studies.28,29 Moreover, in situ measurements
using ISEs inherently avoid sample preparation that is typical of
liquid chromatography and is often associated with artefacts due to
surfactant adsorption to container and filter surfaces. Also, in situ
ISE measurements are not affected by equilibrium shifts that result
from changes in volumes and solvents in the course of ex situ analysis.
In this context, various models have been proposed to quantify binding
of surfactants to polyions, including models according to which the
surfactants bind with a 1:1 stoichiometry to the individual charged
repeat units of the polyions, as well as models involving cooperative
binding.22−24

In this study, we found that a 1:1 binding
model that does not invoke cooperativity accurately describes the
binding interactions between PFOS and the individual repeat units
of poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin), 1, and poly(diallyldimethylammonium), 2, which
each carry a positive charge (see Figure 1). These polyquaternium polymers are good
candidates for sequestration of PFOS because they have a high charge
density and a hydrophobic backbone and side chains. To measure free
PFOS in the presence of these polymers using an ISE with a fluorous
membrane, a fluorophilic imidazolium cation was synthesized for use
as an anion-exchange site. Fluorous-phase ISEs have been shown before
to have excellent selectivity for PFOS over other anions,30 but anion-exchange sites used previously to
prepare such ISEs were found to undergo oxidation, limiting the detection
limits, and long-term stability of such sensors.31 The newly prepared imidazolium anion-exchange site provides
stable sensor responses, and the fluorous-phase membranes prepared
therewith show very high selectivities for PFOS over both carbonate
and bicarbonate, which allows for direct monitoring of PFOS binding.
To simulate environmental conditions, binding of PFOS to the polyquaternium
polymers was also measured in the presence of soil from Tinker Air
Force Base, demonstrating the applicability of ISEs for such measurements.
Because interactions of polyquaternium polymers and soil from Tinker
Air Force Base have been reported previously,21 equilibrium constants as determined in this work can be used to
model the amount of polyquaternium polymers needed to sequester a
desired amount of PFOS under environmentally relevant conditions.

Theory
Response Mechanism of PFOS–Selective
Electrodes
ISEs are sensors that detect the concentration
of target ions within a given sample solution by current-free measurements
of the electrical potential, E, with respect to a
reference electrode. The key component of the ISE is the ion-selective
membrane, which is in direct contact with the sample. Any change in
the measured potential (that is, E) is the direct
result of a change in the phase boundary potential, ΔΦPB, at the interface of the sample and the ion-selective membrane.
The latter is given as follows for a PFOS–selective electrode 1  where R is the ideal
gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday’s constant, Φo is a constant
that depends on PFOS and the nature of the PFOS–selective membrane, z is the charge of PFOS, and aPFOS,sample and aPFOS,mem are the activities of
PFOS within the sample and the membrane phase, respectively. Under
conditions in which aPFOS,mem does not
depend on aPFOS,sample, eq 1 can be simplified to 2  which
shows that the measured potential depends linearly on the logarithm
of the activity of PFOS within the sample. The essence of making a
good PFOS–selective electrode is, therefore, (i) to choose
a membrane material that permits selective transfer of PFOS into the
ISE membrane and (ii) to make aPFOS,mem independent of the sample. The latter is typically achieved by inclusion
into the membrane matrix of strongly hydrophobic cations (commonly
referred to as cationic sites).

For the work presented here,
PFOS–selective membranes were doped with the fluorophilic salt 3. Prior to their first use for measurements in samples of
interest, the membranes were immersed into a potassium perfluorooctyl-1-sulfonate
(KPFOS) solution, resulting in the transfer of PFOS into the fluorous
sensing membrane in exchange for iodide transferring from the membrane
into the aqueous phase. This process is referred to as conditioning
and has to be performed with every new electrode. Conditioning loads
the bulk of the PFOS–selective membrane with a constant concentration
of PFOS that equals the concentration of fluorophilic cations. When
the PFOS–selective electrode is subsequently immersed into
samples that contain different concentrations of PFOS, this does not
affect the composition of the membrane bulk, but it affects ion concentrations
in the nanometer-thin charge separation layer at the interface of
the sample and the PFOS–selective membrane (see Figure 2). The charge separation at
this interface is the cause of the phase boundary potential, ΔΦPB. Interested readers are referred to tutorials and reviews
on ISEs.32,35,36

cationic sites confined to the sensing membrane.

Binding of PFOS to Polyquaternium Polymers and Sensor Response Model
Binding models that describe 1:1 binding of surfactants to the
individual charged repeat units of polyions were reported previously.24,25,27 Here, we present a new method
to interpret potentiometric data for surfactant binding to the charged
repeat unit of polyions by combining the 1:1 binding model with the
ISE response model presented in the prior section. This allows for
straightforward prediction and fitting of experimental potentiometric
data in one step, avoiding more cumbersome initial calculations of
bound and free concentrations of the surfactant ion, followed by fitting
of binding isotherms, as previously suggested.24,37 This streamlined approach is described in the following for PFOS
as the species detected selectively by the ISEs.

Binding of
PFOS to the charged units of the polyquaternium polymers in a 1:1
stoichiometry is described by the following reaction 3  where [PFOS]free is the
concentration of free PFOS within the sample solution, [R]free is the concentration of free charged polymer repeat units, and [PFOS·R]
represents a section of the polymer with a bound PFOS molecule. This
equilibrium is characterized by the binding constant, K 4  To relate K to experimental data, the terms [PFOS]free and [R]free must be replaced with known parameters
or experimental observables, i.e., the total PFOS concentration, [PFOS]total, and the total concentration of free charged polymer
repeat units, [R]total. As shown in the Supporting Information, solving the combination of eqs 3 and 4 gives [PFOS]free as follows 5  Equation 5 describes
[PFOS]free in a system where [PFOS]total and
[R]total can be experimentally controlled, leaving only
the binding constant, K, as a variable.

As
it follows from eq 2,
the response of an ISE for PFOS in its working range is given as32 6  where Eo is the standard potential of the electrochemical
cell (including contributions from the reference electrode and the
liquid junction between the reference electrode and the sample).38,39 For the experiments described below, the ionic strength is dominated
by the 10 mM NaHCO3 used to simulate groundwater, allowing
us to simplify eq 6 by
assuming a constant activity coefficient for PFOS, which can, therefore,
be combined with Eo into a new constant Eo′ 7  Finally, insertion of the right-hand
side of eq 5 for [PFOS]free into eq 7 gives 8  Equation 8 shows that
for a given [R]total, the stronger PFOS binds to the polymer,
the lower the PFOS concentration that is detected, and because of
the negative charge of PFOS (z = −1), the
higher E becomes. For a fixed total concentration
of PFOS, eq 5 predicts
that the concentration of [PFOS]free decreases continuously
as the concentration of [R]total increases, and eq 8 shows that E increases (see Figure S5).

However,
the fluorous ISEs used for this work have a lower limit of detection
(i.e., the lowest concentration that can be detected) that is determined
by very small fluxes of KPFOS from the inner filling solution across
the sensing membrane into the sample solution, locally contaminating
samples at their interface to the sensing membrane of the ISE with
PFOS.40 This prevents E from increasing without end, as it is predicted by eq 8,29 and
it results in a lower limit of detection for PFOS that is determined
by the KPFOS flux and therefore unaffected by (i) the concentration
and/or pH of the bicarbonate buffer used and (ii) the amount of HCl
used to adjust the pH. To account for this quantitatively, it is also
important to recognize that the ISE’s limit of detection is
lowered (i.e., improved) when polyquaternium polymer is added to the
aqueous sample. This can be explained by binding of this polyquaternium
polymer to the PFOS that is leaching continuously at very low concentrations
out of the sensing membrane into the sample (referred to here as [PFOS]limit). To account for this in the fitting model, an additional
term, [PFOS]limit, is added to eq 8, giving 9  ISE response curves as predicted
using eq 9 are presented
in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Predicted measured
potential, E, versus the logarithm of the total polyquaternium
polymer concentration. Black, blue, and red traces are predicted for
[PFOS]total = 41.6 μM, Eo′ = −63.8 mV, [PFOS]limit = 6 μM, and the
values of 104, 105, and 5 × 105 M–1, of the binding constants, K, as indicated in the figure. Note that the numerical values for
the former three parameters were obtained from fits of data shown
in Figure 4.

As Figure 3 shows, the ISE’s response at low
polyquaternium polymer concentrations is unaffected by the inclusion
of [PFOS]limit. However, at high polyquaternium polymer
concentrations (i.e., low concentrations of PFOS in the bulk of the
aqueous sample), E does not continue to increase
continuously, as predicted by eq 8 and shown in Figure S5. The plateau
at high polymer concentrations is the result of the limit of detection
of the PFOS ISE. Equation 9 was used to fit all experimental data discussed in the following.

Results and Discussion
Equilibrium Constants for Binding of PFOS
to Polyquaternium Polymers in Absence of Soil
Data collected
during additions of KPFOS to 10 mM sodium bicarbonate solutions were
used to experimentally determine the standard potential, Eo′ (Figure 4).

Figure 4 E values
measured during the addition of KPFOS to a 10 mM NaHCO3 solution (×) and a fit (solid line) based on the Nikolskii–Eisenman
equation41 (see Supporting Information for more details).

The highest concentration of PFOS used for sensor calibrations
was limited by the concentration of the PFOS solution used for these
additions, which was kept below the solubility limit of PFOS (1.3
mM).9 Polyquaternium polymer was then added
to the sample solution, which caused E to increase
as [PFOS]free decreased. Figure 5 shows data characteristic of the addition
of poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
to PFOS-containing solutions. The experimental data exhibit the same
trend as predicted by eq 9 and Figure 3, where E rises with increasing polyquaternium polymer concentrations.
For clarity, data for two fits of polyquaternium polymer additions
to a solution of constant [PFOS]total are presented (for
a more comprehensive set of data, see Figures S6 and S7).

Figure 5 E values measured during the addition
of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (black ×) or poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) (blue circles) to a 25.4 μM KPFOS
solutions (10 mM NaHCO3, pH = 7). The black and dashed
blue lines represent fits of the experimental data fitted based on eq 9.

Data for addition of either poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
or poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) into solutions
of constant [PFOS]total were collected with three separate
ISEs. Equilibrium constants for binding of PFOS to poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin)
were calculated to be 2.7 ± 0.6 × 105 and 6.4
± 0.7 × 105 M–1, respectively
(95% confidence intervals). A similar equilibrium constant for binding
of the longer but nonfluorinated molecule 1-decylsulfonate to poly(l-lysine)24 at neutral pH was reported
to be 2 × 105 M–1. Equilibrium constants
for PFOS binding to solid surfaces such as powdered multiwalled carbon
nanotubes42 and alumina43 measured using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) techniques have been reported as 2.9 × 106 and 3.1 × 107 M–1, respectively.
In addition, these techniques report adsorption capacities of 5.2
× 10–3 g PFOS/g multiwalled carbon nanotubes
and 2.2 × 10–5 g PFOS/g alumina, respectively.
For comparison, the binding of one PFOS molecule to each polymer repeat
unit results in 3.08 g PFOS/g poly(diallyldimethylammonium) and 3.63
g PFOS/g poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin).
In view of environmental remediation, the applicability of polyquaternium
polymers as solutions and the high mass efficiency in the use of polyquaternium
polymers as compared to other adsorbents may be advantageous.

Effect
of Soil on Systems Containing Polyquaternium and PFOS
To
more closely simulate environmental conditions that are relevant to
PFOS sequestration from an environmentally relevant sample, soil from
Tinker Air Force Base was first equilibrated for 1 week with polyquaternium
polymers in an aqueous solution that contained 10 mM NaHCO3 (adjusted to pH = 7). Then, the blend of soil and polymer was added
(by stepwise addition from an aqueous mixture) to buffered solutions
that contained PFOS. For the interpretation of such an experiment,
in addition to PFOS binding to the polymer (eq 3), three additional equilibria were initially
considered to either directly or indirectly affect the concentration
of freely dissolved PFOS (i.e., PFOS bound neither to soil nor polymer) 10   11   12  Although
PFOS is known to bind certain types of soil,44 we found that in the absence of polyquaternium polymers, PFOS does
not bind to soil from Tinker Air Force Base when buffered soil mixtures
were added into solutions with [PFOS]total = 0.35 mM, resulting
in soil concentrations as high as 14.7 g soil/L (Table S1). Measured E values during the addition
of soil remained constant within ±1 mV, indicating that even
at the high concentration of [PFOS]total, which should
promote binding, [PFOS]free did not change. Would PFOS
binding to soil have been observed, the equilibrium described by eq 10 could have been studied
in detail using the presented technique. However, for this work, there
was no need to consider this additional equilibrium reaction. Therefore,
equilibrium constants for binding of PFOS to polyquaternium polymers
in the absence of soil (eq 3) were determined quantitatively as discussed in the previous
section considering only the equilibria described by eqs 11 and 12.
Binding of polyquaternium polymers to soil (eq 11) from Tinker Air Force Base has been studied
in detail in a previous study for the same conditions used here.20 This binding leads to a reduction of the concentration
of the polymer in solution. However, soil-bound polymer still binds
PFOS (eq 12), although
with an affinity expected to be different from that of the dissolved
polymer.

Experimental data for PFOS binding to polymer–soil
mixtures as a function of the polymer concentration are shown in Figures 6, S8, and S9, along with sensor responses predicted using the
binding constants determined for soil-free conditions.

Figure 6 Evidence for polymer
binding to soil: experimental E values collected
during the addition of a poly(diallyldimethylammonium)/soil mixture
(black ×) or a poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin)/soil
mixture (blue circles) to a 300 μM KPFOS solution (10 mM NaHCO3, pH = 7). The solid black and dashed blue lines are predictions
for PFOS binding to the polymer if soil was absent (K = 2.7 × 105 and 6.4 × 105 M–1, respectively).

For each polyquaternium polymer, the concentration of polymer
required to bind a given amount of PFOS increased as a result of the
presence of soil. In addition, in the plots of log10[PFOS]free versus log10[R]total, the onset
of binding at [R]total ≈ 10–3.5 M is characterized by a smaller slope (more pronounced for poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin)), indicating reduced binding constants
of PFOS to the polycationic polymer (see Figure 3). Moreover, the onset of the binding region
moved to higher polymer concentrations (i.e., log10[R]total), resulting in a shift of the entire response to the
right (see Figure S10 for further illustration).

To fit the experimental data, we used previously reported20,21 information about binding of polyquaterniums polymers to the same
Tinker Air Force Base soil samples as used in this study. Specifically,
it was known from the work that 97.9 and 98.5% of poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin),
respectively, are bound to this type of soil at the same concentrations
we used in this study. With the vast majority of each polymer bound
to soil, and considering the equilibrium constants for PFOS binding
to the polycationic polymers determined for soil-free conditions,
it follows that the concentration of charged repeat units free in
solution is not large enough to bind a significant amount of PFOS
(<2% of the total PFOS bound) for the concentration range of log10[R]total shown in Figure 6. Therefore, it can be concluded that PFOS
binds predominantly to soil-bound polymer, resulting in soil/polymer/PFOS
aggregates. Experimental data were fitted to eq 9 using the concentration of charged repeat
units bound to soil, i.e., 97.9 or 98.5% of the total concentration
of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin), respectively. Data and fits characteristic
of this binding are presented in Figure 7 (for full sets of data, see Figures S11 and S12). Equilibrium constants for
binding of PFOS to soil-bound poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride
and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) were determined
to be 9.3 ± 0.6 × 104 and 7.3 ± 1.2 ×
104 M–1, respectively (95% confidence
intervals). For comparison, binding constants, measured by LC–MS,
of PFOS to sand-bound poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) were reported to be an order of magnitude
weaker, with K = 3.1 × 103 and 1.6
× 103, respectively20 (the
affinity of the polyquaternium polymer to sand was stronger than its
affinity for soil from Tinker Air Force Base).

Figure 7 E values
measured during the addition of soil-bound poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
(black ×) or poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin)
(blue circles) to a 300 μM KPFOS solutions (10 mM NaHCO3, pH = 7). The black and dashed blue lines represent fits
of the experimental data fitted based on eq 9.

In the presence of soil, binding constants decreased 3-fold
and 9-fold for poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin), respectively, as compared to the corresponding
soil-free systems. Although these binding constants are noticeably
reduced, the PFOS that is bound to polymer is retained on soil particles,
is no longer mobile, and can be employed to contain groundwater contaminant
plumes. Importantly, the thus determined binding constants can be
used to model quantitatively real-life sequestration of PFOS.

Prediction
of the Effect of Polyquaternium Polymer Concentrations on the Efficiency
of PFOS Sequestration
The equilibrium constants determined
for PFOS binding to poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) in soil-containing samples can also
be used to determine the concentrations of polyquaternium polymers
needed to bind a targeted fraction of PFOS. To illustrate this graphically,
a three-dimensional plot is presented in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Three-dimensional plot showing the fraction
of sequestered PFOS as a function of the total soil-bound polymer
and total PFOS concentrations (calculated for K =
9.3 × 104 M–1), where log10[polycation]total is the concentration of poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
in g/L.

As Figure 8 illustrates, the fraction of PFOS bound
to the polycationic polymer in a given system strongly depends both
on [PFOS]total and the total polymer concentration. As
the concentration of PFOS increases, an increasing amount of polyquaternium
polymer must be added to ensure near complete binding of PFOS to soil
(Table S2). As the desired fraction of
bound PFOS increases, there is diminishing returns for any additional
polymer added to the system. The bound fraction of PFOS, as illustrated
in Figure 8, is important
because it illustrates the effectiveness of PFOS removal from the
environment. However, the concentration of PFOS that remains freely
dissolved in solution is also important, as it provides the final
outcome on whether the purified water has been successfully decontaminated.
For example, an increase from 99 to 99.9% of PFOS removed from solution
represents only a small change in fraction bound, but it corresponds
to a very large change in free PFOS concentration that is difficult
to visualize with an illustration as Figure 8. Therefore, the data of Figure 8 are replotted in Figure 9 to show the concentration
of PFOS that goes unbound based on the concentrations of [PFOS]total and [R]total (see Figure S13 for poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin)
data). Here, a logarithmic y-axis allows for intuitive
visualization of the concentration of PFOS that is not bound to the
polymer–soil blend, which is the portion of PFOS that will
not be sequestered from the aqueous phase.

Figure 9 Plot showing the concentration
of unbound PFOS versus the total amount of PFOS in a system. The dashed
black line shows the EPA health advisory PFOS level (log10[1.86 pM] = −11.7).9 The solid
line in black stands for a system without polymer. All other lines
are labeled with the concentration (in g/L) of the soil-bound poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
polymer. Colored diamonds refer to data from Figures 7 to S11.

The concentrations of unbound
PFOS from Figure 9 can
be directly compared to the recommended EPA health advisory level
of 70 parts per trillion, which corresponds to 1 ng/L or 1.86 pM.
The input concentration of polyquaternium polymer bound to soil can
be adjusted to achieve the maximum allowable free concentration of
PFOS (log10[1.86 pM] = −11.7). At a contaminant
concentration in groundwater that is typical in view of EPA data (≈0.1
nM),9 a charged repeat unit concentration
of 1 mM lowers the free PFOS concentration to <0.1 nM (Figure 9), which is below
the health advisory level. This 1 mM concentration of charged repeat
units corresponds to a concentration of 0.16 g/L of poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
polymer (which in the absence of soil is miscible with water at any
concentration but will bind to soil, as discussed above). Concentrations
above this range could be used to provide a permeable absorptive barrier
that has a sufficiently high effective capacity to keep the PFOS concentration
low over extended periods of time.

Conclusions
In
summary, the equilibrium constants for PFOS binding to the polyquaternium
polymers poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) were determined in absence and presence
of soil using fluorous-phase ISEs. These sensors were fabricated using
a semifluorinated imidazolium cation as an anion-exchanger specifically
developed for this purpose. Binding constants can be determined directly
by fitting emf data obtained when adding polyquaternium polymers to
solutions of PFOS, which streamlines the data interpretation reported
in prior work. Even though the affinity of the polyquaternium polymers
for PFOS was decreased by the presence of soil, PFOS was still bound
with affinities of 9.3 ± 0.6 × 104 and 7.3 ±
1.2 × 104 M–1 for poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin),
respectively. These quantitative data can be used to predict the concentrations
of polyquaternium polymers required to reduce the concentration of
unbound PFOS. Specifically, PFOS concentrations can be reduced below
the EPA health advisory level of 0.1 nM using poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
chloride concentrations as low as 0.16 g/L.

Experimental Section
Materials
Potassium perfluorooctyl-1-sulfonate (KPFOS) and imidazole were
purchased from Alfa Aesar, KCl, NaHCO3, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-7-methyloctyl
iodide, perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene, and 1 M HCl from Sigma Aldrich,
and poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride and poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) from Accepta (Manchester, U.K.). All
materials were used as received. Polypropylene volumetric flasks and
beakers (purchased from BRAND, Wertheim, Germany) were used to reduce
PFOS adsorption to container surfaces.31

Preparation of PFOS–Selective Membranes
PFOS–selective
membranes were prepared to contain 1.0 mM of the anion-exchanger salt
1,3-di(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-7-methyloctyl)imidazolium iodide (3; to provide permselectivity)32 and 10 mM of the fluorophilic electrolyte 1,3-di(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-7-methyloctyl)imidazolium
tetrakis[3,5-bis(perfluorooctyl)phenyl]borate (4; to
reduce membrane resistance)33,34 in perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene
as the inert fluorous membrane matrix (see Figure 10). The syntheses of 3 and 4 and the preparation of the fluorous-phase PFOS–selective
electrodes are described in the Supporting Information.

of PFOS–selective electrodes used in this work. Compound 3 imparts permselectivity and compound 4 reduces
electrical resistance.

Polyquaternium Polymer Additions to Solutions of Constant Total PFOS
Concentrations
After equilibration of the ISEs with pH-buffered
PFOS solutions (as described in the Supporting Information), the electrodes were rinsed and placed in a solution
containing only 10.0 mM NaHCO3 (pH = 7.0, adjusted with
1.0 M HCl). Potentials were monitored until they were stable (≈20
min). Then, the concentration of PFOS was increased stepwise to 25.4
μM by small additions (Δlog[PFOS] ≈ 0.3) of a concentrated
KPFOS solution (0.735 mM), while monitoring the potential after each
addition. Once the concentration of 25.4 μM KPFOS was reached,
poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride or poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin) was added stepwise, increasing the concentration
of the polymer in increments of log[polymer] ≈ 0.3. The measured
electrical potential was allowed to stabilize after each addition
(≈5 min).

Potential readings as a function of the PFOS
concentration were fitted with the Nernst equation. These fits were
used to determine the standard cell potential and the limit of detection
of the sensor, which was likely determined by a transmembrane flux
of KPFOS from the inner filling solution of the electrode through
the membrane into the sample. These values were then used as constants
when fitting data measured during the addition of polyquaternium polymer.
A detailed description of the fitting process is included in the Results and Discussion.

Soil Preparation
Soil was obtained from Tinker Air Force Base, a Department of Defense
Facility located in the South Central United States (Oklahoma City,
OK). Located within the Central Red-bed Plains of the Central Lowland
Physiographic Province, Tinker Air Force Base soil is colored red
by ferric anhydride. Soil oven-dried overnight at 100 °C was
sieved to a 40–50 mesh size range (i.e., 0.420–0.297
mm) to ensure media homogeneity. Pre-existing PFAS contamination of
the soil was evaluated by mixing 5 g of soil with 20 mL of methanol
for 72 h in a centrifuge tube. After centrifugation for 15 min, the
methanol supernatant was decanted and analyzed with high-performance
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry for PFAS content, but
none was detected.

Polyquaternium Polymer–Soil Additions
to Solutions of Constant Total PFOS Concentrations
Solutions
of a polyquaternium polymer and Tinker Air Force Base soil were prepared
by mixing 100 mL of 10 mM NaHCO3 (pH = 7), 25 g of Tinker
soil, and 2.277 g/L of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride or 2.274
g/L of poly(dimethylamine-co-epichlorohydrin). Polyquaternium/soil
mixtures were stirred for 1 week prior to use to ensure equilibrium
binding. In addition, mixtures not containing a polyquaterniums polymer
were prepared. The volume displaced by the addition on 25 g of Tinker
Air Force Base soil to 100 mL of water was measured to be 9.8 mL.
This displaced volume was corrected for when adding well-mixed polyquaternium/soil
mixtures to PFOS-containing solutions.
