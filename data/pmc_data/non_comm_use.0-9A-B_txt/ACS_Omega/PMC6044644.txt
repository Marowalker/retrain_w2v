The fluorescence
lifetime of the endogenous fluorophore of reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in HeLa cells is affected
by the application of nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs).
In this study, we found that after nsPEF application, the fluorescence
lifetime became longer and then decreased in a stepwise manner upon
further application, irrespective of the pulse width in the range
of 10–50 ns. This application time dependence of the NADH fluorescence
lifetime is very similar to the time-lapse dependence of the NADH
fluorescence lifetime following the addition of an apoptosis inducer,
staurosporine. These results, as well as the membrane swelling and
blebbing after the application of nsPEFs, indicate that apoptosis
is also induced by the application of nsPEFs in HeLa cells. In contrast
to the lifetime, the fluorescence intensity remarkably depended on
the pulse width of the applied nsPEF. When the pulse width was as
large as 50 ns, the intensity monotonically increased and was distributed
over the entire cell as the application duration became longer. As
the pulse width of the applied electric field became smaller, the
magnitude of the field-induced increase in NADH fluorescence intensity
decreased; the intensity was reduced by the electric field when the
pulse width was as small as 10 ns. These results suggest that the
mechanism of electric-field-induced apoptosis depends on the pulse
width of the applied nsPEF.

Introduction
Intracellular signaling
plays a pivotal role in cell functioning,
which requires coordinated and accurate transformation of information
from organelles and/or signaling proteins to others through cell membranes.
One of the best examples can be seen in programmed cell death, which
is called apoptosis. During apoptosis, cells die in a highly coordinated
manner, following the induction of the cell death signal. During the
process, chromatin condensation and nucleus fragmentation occur without
damage to the surrounding cells, which later induce structural changes,
such as a reduction in cell volume and membrane blebbing. Mitochondria
are well known as one of the key regulators of intracellular signaling
in apoptosis. Many research groups have emphasized the role of certain
biochemical processes, including the disruption of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) production through the alteration of electron transport processes,
the alteration of cellular oxidation reduction, and the release of
proteins that trigger the activation of caspase family proteases,
which takes place in mitochondria during apoptosis.1−6

Several chemical substances trigger apoptosis, including death
receptor-mediated apoptosis inducers such as staurosporine (STS) and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; however, it remains unclear why
a variety of cells die in the same manner in response to the same
substances and conditions.7−10 A common feature of apoptosis is the transformation
of both information and apoptotic-activated proteins from the inner
membrane of mitochondria to other intracellular organelles due to
the collapse of the transmembrane potential. This collapse opens voltage-dependent
channels and results from the nonequilibrium of ions between the inner
and outer spaces of mitochondria, which can be induced by apoptotic
substances and death receptors.11

Over the past several years, significant progress has been made
in delivering external biomolecules, DNA, and quantum dots into living
cells and in intracellular recordings of the action potential through
electroporation by pulsed electric fields (PEFs).12−16 Along with this, a number of researchers have also
reported electric-field-induced increases in intracellular calcium,
nuclear perturbations, apoptosis, and other physiological processes.17−20 Several approaches regarding electric fields have been demonstrated
to manipulate the cell interior, but the effects of PEFs on intracellular
processes are not fully understood. The responses of individual cells
undergoing physiological and biochemical activation and/or changing
processes are quite heterogeneous in time and space. Moreover, measurements
of these physical parameters under bulk conditions with conventional
physiological and biochemical methods often fail to reveal the intracellular
kinetics and subcellular dynamics that are involved. However, it is
important to understand how cells actually work under these specific
conditions. Autofluorescence microscopy (i.e., autofluorescence intensity
and lifetime imaging) is one of the most useful and robust noninvasive
techniques for evaluating the subcellular activity of individual cells
undergoing different physiological and biochemical changes.21−24

In our previous study,25 fluorescence
lifetime and intensity images of enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) demonstrated the effects of PEFs on HeLa cells expressing EGFP.
After the application of PEFs with a 50 ns pulse width and a 40 kV
cm–1 strength, we measured the cell morphological
changes and the EGFP fluorescence lifetime reduction. Furthermore,
we detected the loss of plasma membrane asymmetry by assessing the
redistribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer layer of the
plasma membrane. We concluded that apoptosis is induced by the application
of nanosecond PEFs (nsPEFs). However, we did not completely understand
the mechanism of the observed field-induced apoptosis in these cells.
In addition, these experiments were performed only with applied electric
fields having a pulse width of 50 ns.

The electrical model of
biological cells predicts that electric
fields will interact with intracellular structural proteins without
affecting the outer cellular membrane, as long as electric fields
with a pulse width (t) that is shorter than the charging
time of the outer membrane (τc) are applied. In the
cases where t ≫ τc, for example,
no field effect would be expected in intracellular organelles, although
some changes or heating effects in the outer plasma membrane may be
expected.26 In contrast, the effects of
electric fields on intracellular organelles and proteins are expected
when t is much smaller than τc of
the outer membrane. If electric pulses whose width is shorter than
τc of the outer membrane are applied with an amplitude
larger than that of the voltage across the subcellular membrane, it
is expected that the PEF will cause significant effects on the intracellular
function and dynamics. This selective nature of electric fields with
respect to the charging time of the membrane will hold true for both
the extracellular membrane and the subcellular organelle membranes,
which may induce selective and controlled effects from PEFs on subcellular
organelles and signaling.

In this study, we used a homemade
bioelectric chip fabricated on a culture glass slide prepared by the
UV photolithographic method.25 The chip
is available for the application of PEFs in any kind of living cells/tissues
(size ≤100 μm) and for the real-time monitoring of the
effects of PEFs on living cells/tissues. The aim of this study was
to activate the physiological and biochemical intracellular mechanisms
that take part in the process of programmed cell death to better understand
the biological effects of PEFs through the noninvasive detection of
intracellular coenzymes in the form of autofluorescence measurements
of NADH. The visualization of intracellular NADH by fluorescence intensity
and lifetime microscopy makes it possible to distinguish intracellular
organelles such as mitochondria and cytosol, which take part in glucose
metabolism for ATP production, from other nonfluorescent organelles
without inducing exogenous chromophores. To examine the pulse-width
dependence of the applied electric-field effect, electric fields with
square pulse widths of 10, 20, 30, and 50 ns were applied to living
HeLa cells; responses were monitored using NADH autofluorescence intensity
and lifetime microscopy.

Results
Autofluorescence intensity
and lifetime images of endogenous NADH
in HeLa cells were observed before and after the application of PEFs
with a pulse width of 50 ns, strength of 45 kV cm–1, and a repetition rate of 1 kHz. The results are shown in Figure 1. The intensity image
shows the natural distribution of NADH within the cells. Because of
the very weak fluorescence signal, the nucleus can be differentiated
from other NADH-fluorescent organelles when the electric field is
not applied, and the intensity of mitochondria-associated NADH appears
dominant. As shown in Supporting Information (Figure S1), the fluorescence decay profiles of NADH were fitted
by assuming a biexponential decay, that is, ∑iAi exp(−t/τi), where Ai and τi are the pre-exponential factor and the lifetime of the ith component, respectively, that is, i = 1 and 2.
A third component whose lifetime is longer than 10 ns exists, but
this component was neglected in the present analysis because the contribution
of this weak emission was very small.23 The histogram of the average fluorescence lifetime, that is, ∑iAiτi/Ai in each pixel, is also shown in Figure 1. This is the amplitude
average lifetime that a fluorophore would have if it had the same
steady-state fluorescence as the fluorophore with several lifetimes.27 The decay profiles show both fast- and slowly
decaying components whose lifetimes are ∼460 ps and ∼3.9
ns, respectively, before the application of the electric field (see Table 1 and Figure S1). Note that the analysis whose results are shown
in Table 1 was carried
out by assuming a biexponential decay for the summation of the decay
profiles of all of the pixels. These quickly and slowly decaying components
were assigned to two different protein-bound species of NADH in HeLa
cells, loosely protein-bound NADH and tightly protein-bound NADH,
respectively, as opposed to free and protein-bound NADH. As shown
in our previous paper,23 the shift of the
picosecond time-resolved fluorescence due to the existence of free
NADH was not observed in HeLa cells, suggesting that the classification
between loosely and tightly protein-bound proteins may be appropriate
in the present case.

Control experiments were done with a biochip to confirm that the
observed changes in intensity and lifetime of NADH autofluorescence
in HeLa cells, as well as structural changes, resulted from the application
of the PEF and not from any external factors such as laser light irradiation
or measurement conditions. Thus, time-lapse measurements of autofluorescence
images of NADH in HeLa were performed under the same experimental
conditions but without the application of the electric field. Changes
in cell morphology and autofluorescence lifetime were not observed
without the application of the electric field, even after 1 h photoirradiation
under a similar irradiation light intensity, as shown in Figure S2. These results indicate that the observed
changes in the fluorescence properties of NADH and in cellular morphology
were induced by the application of the nsPEFs.

The application
of a 50 ns PEF enhanced the intensity of NADH fluorescence
and also changed the intracellular intensity distribution in each
cell; the increased intensity extended over the entire region of the
cell, and the nucleus could not be distinguished from other organelles
after the application (see Figure 1). The intensity was estimated by integrating the decay
profile at each pixel, and these intensities were summed for all of
the cells observed in the images to estimate the total intensity before
and after the application of electric fields. Along with the change
in intensity, the average lifetime of NADH also changed, that is,
from ∼1.3 ns (before application) to ∼1.6 ns (after
the 120 s application) (see Table 1 and the histogram in Figure 1). However, further application of 180 s,
that is, a total field application duration of 300 s, induced a decrease
in the lifetime to ∼1.4 ns, although the intensity became stronger.
We also noticed that the longer application of the 50 ns PEF induced
swelling in the cellular structure, as shown in Figure S3.

Similar experiments with different pulse
widths of 30, 20, and
10 ns were carried out with the same repetition rate, field strength,
and application duration. These results are shown in Figures 2–4. It was then found that the effect of nsPEFs on
the NADH fluorescence intensity depended on the pulse width of the
applied electric field. As mentioned, the NADH fluorescence intensity
increases after the application of the electric field of 50 ns pulse
width. Application of electric fields with a much shorter pulse width
of 10 ns, however, led to a slight decrease in NADH fluorescence intensity
both after the 120 s application and after the 300 s application.
Plots of fluorescence intensity obtained after the application of
nsPEFs relative to the intensity obtained before the application of
the electric field are shown in Figure 5a for different pulse widths, as a function of the
field application duration. The intensity observed with a 30 ns pulse
width shows the application duration dependence similar to that with
a 50 ns pulse width; the intensity monotonically increased with increasing
application duration, although the magnitude of the increase is smaller
than that with the 50 ns pulse width (see Figure 5a). With a 20 ns pulse width, the fluorescence
intensity slightly increased after the 120 s application, but the
intensity is nearly the same after the 300 s application. Thus, the
magnitude of the field-induced increase in NADH fluorescence intensity
appears to decrease with smaller pulse widths of the applied electric
field, and the field effect on intensity changes from enhancement
to quenching as the pulse width becomes smaller from 50 to 10 ns.

intensity of NADH
in HeLa cells after the application of an electric field (IF≠0) relative to the
intensity before the application (IF=0) as a function of field application duration, with different
pulse widths of 10, 20, 30, and 50 ns, a field strength of 45 kV cm–1, and a repetition rate of 1 kHz. (b) Plots of the
ratio of the fluorescence lifetime of NADH after the application of
an electric field (τF≠0)
relative to the lifetime before the application (τF=0), as a function of the pulse width of the applied
electric field. An expanded view of the intensities for 10 and 20
ns pulse widths is also shown in the inset of (a). The intensity was
estimated by integrating the intensities of all of the pixels, and
the lifetime was obtained from the peak in the histogram.

When the same field strength and the same repetition
rate are used,
the electrical energy produced by the applied electric field is proportional
to the pulse width, and the total energy produced by a 50 ns pulse
width is fivefold higher than that produced by a 10 ns pulse width.
As shown in Figure 5, however, it is clear that the difference among the various pulse
widths, with regard to the duration dependence of field-induced intensity
changes, does not come from the difference in the total electric power
of the applied electric field. There is a clear gap between 30 and
20 ns regarding the pulse-width dependence of the field effect on
the fluorescence intensity, which may be related to the nature of
the effects of nsPEFs on the intracellular function.

Regarding
the field-induced changes in fluorescence lifetime, a
similar trend was observed with any pulse width in the range of 10–50
ns, in contrast to the field effect on intensity. As shown in Figures 1d–4d, the average lifetime became longer in the first
step, that is, after the first application of the PEF for 120 s. After
the next 180 s application, the lifetime became shorter, but it was
still longer than that observed before the application of the electric
field. The lifetime and pre-exponential factor of each of the fast-
and slowly decaying components observed before and after the application
of electric fields with pulse widths of 10, 20, and 30 ns are also
shown in Table 1, together
with the results for 50 ns. This analysis was carried out by assuming
a biexponential decay for the summation of all of the decay profiles
collected from different pixels in the image, which is the same as
the one used for the evaluation of the lifetime before and after the
application of the electric field having a 50 ns pulse width. In every
case, the average lifetime is very similar to the peak lifetime of
the histogram shown in Figures 1d–4d. As shown in Table 1, the magnitude of the change
in lifetime after the application of 120 s has a tendency to decrease
with increasing pulse width of the applied field. This behavior is
clearly seen in Figure 5b. The magnitude of the reduction in lifetime after the 300 s application
was rather small when the shorter pulse widths were used; the difference
in the lifetime between the 120 and 300 s applications relative to
the difference between the 0 and 120 s applications was smaller with
a pulse width of 10 or 20 ns than that with a pulse width of 30 or
50 ns. For example, this ratio was 0.38 and 0.72, respectively, for
pulse widths of 10 and 50 ns.

The lengthening of the average
fluorescence lifetime after the
application of the electric field of 120 s mainly resulted from the
lengthening of the lifetime of the fast-decaying component in every
pulse width, as shown in Table 1. Moreover, the difference in the average
lifetime after the 120 s application between the short pulse width
(10 or 20 ns) and the large pulse width (30 or 50 ns) came from the
difference in the lifetime of the slow component; the lifetime of
the slow component became larger with the application of electric
fields of a 10 or 20 ns pulse width compared to that of electric fields
of a 30 or 50 ns pulse width. After the 300 s application, the lifetime
of the fast component became shorter, resulting in a shorter average
lifetime for the 300 s application than for the 120 s application.
With 10 or 20 ns pulse width, the pre-exponential factor of the slow
component increased after the 300 s application, and the lifetime
of the fast component was still longer than that before the application
of the electric field. In the case of 50 or 30 ns pulse width, the
lifetime of the fast-decaying component after the 300 s application
was similar to the one observed before the application of the electric
field, and the difference in the average lifetime after the 300 s
application and before the application came from the difference in
the pre-exponential factor of the slowly decaying component.

The experimental results of the effects of nsPEFs on the NADH fluorescence
intensity and lifetime in HeLa cells are summarized as follows: (1)
when the pulse width is as large as 50 or 30 ns, the fluorescence
intensity increases and distributes over the entire cell with application
of the electric field; (2) when the pulse width is smaller than some
threshold, the fluorescence intensity is nearly constant or slightly
de-enhanced by nsPEF application; (3) the fluorescence lifetime becomes
longer by applying nsPEF of any pulse width in the range of 10 –
50 ns; (4) after the 300 s application, the fluorescence lifetime
is shorter than that observed after the 120 s application but still
longer than that before the field application; (5) the field-induced
lengthening of the fluorescence lifetime after the 120 s application
mainly results from the lengthening of the lifetime of the fast-decaying
component in the case of 30 or 50 ns pulse width, whereas the lengthening
of both the fast- and slowly decaying components leads to the lengthening
of the average lifetime for 10 or 20 ns pulse width; (6) the field-induced
increase in the pre-exponential factor of the slow component plays
an important role in showing the difference with a 30 or 50 ns pulse
width between the lifetimes before the application and after the 300
s application, whereas both the lifetime of the fast component and
the pre-exponential factor of the slow component change after the
300 s application for 10 or 20 ns pulse width.

Discussion
When
the pulse width of the applied electric field is sufficiently
small, the voltage across the membrane is negligible, resulting in
the deep penetration of the applied electric field into intracellular
organelles. In contrast, when the pulse width of the applied electric
field is large enough in comparison to the charging time τc, the voltage across the membrane becomes very large, resulting
in the breakdown of the cell membrane and production of holes on the
cell surface. In a single-shell model,28 τc is given as follows 1  where V is the volume fraction
of cells in the suspension, ρ1 and ρ2 are external and internal resistivity, respectively, Cm is the capacitance of the membrane per unit area, and r is the radius of the spherical cell.

By assuming
that a spherical cell has a radius of 10 μm,
ρ1 and ρ2 of 100 Ω cm, membrane
capacitance of 1 μF cm−2, and a volume fraction
much smaller than one, the charging time is estimated to be 150 ns,
which is much larger than the pulse width of the applied electric
field used in this study. In this case, the electric-field effect
observed in this study is considered to result mainly from the field
effect on the intracellular function.

In addition to the change
in intensity and lifetime of NADH autofluorescence,
structural changes of HeLa cells are induced by the application of
the electric field. The cellular blebbing induced by the applied electric
field was more dominant with a short pulse width of 10 or 20 ns than
with 50 or 30 ns pulse width (see Figures S3 and S4). It is conceivable from the discussion using the above eq 1 that electric fields with
shorter pulse widths penetrate more deeply into mitochondria through
membranes and induce direct modifications of the DNA structure and
biochemical processes, which may affect other signal proteins, subcellular
organelles, and/or biochemical processes.

As mentioned previously,
apoptosis was induced in HeLa cells expressing
EGFP by applying nsPEF with a pulse width of 50 ns and a strength
of 40 kV cm–1.25 Fluorescence
of EGFP is much stronger than the autofluorescence of NADH, and so
the field-induced change in the cellular structure can be clearly
observed in EGFP-expressing HeLa cells. Such a structural change is
also shown in Figure S5. nsPEF-induced
apoptosis has also been reported in other cells, including Jurkat
cells.18,29,30 Our results
show that the effects of nsPEF on the intensity and lifetime of NADH
autofluorescence in HeLa cells are similarly ascribed to electric-field-induced
apoptosis. In the present measurements of NADH autofluorescence, EGFP
has not been expressed in HeLa cells, and the autofluorescence of
NADH has been monitored. Irrespective of the presence of EGFP, we
can conclude that apoptosis is induced by the application of nsPEF
in HeLa cells. Apoptosis is traditionally defined by physiological
changes, such as cell shrinkage, cell surface blebbing, and DNA fragmentation.
Accordingly, some of these physiological changes were observed in
this study, as mentioned above.

Measurements of NADH autofluorescence
lifetime in HeLa cells were
performed with STS, a known inducer of apoptosis.1−5,31 Time lapse of the NADH
fluorescence lifetime following the addition of STS showed the same
trends as those observed in the present results of the pulsed electric-field
effect; after the addition of STS, the autofluorescence lifetime of
NADH increases followed by decreases in a stepwise manner.31 As shown in Figure S6, the results reported above have been reconfirmed in the present
study. Thus, our findings, while showing that the lifetime of NADH
fluorescence increases after the application of an electric field,
also support that apoptosis is induced by the application of nsPEF
in HeLa cells. Similarly to previous experiments with STS, the NADH
fluorescence lifetime becomes shorter after the 300 s application
in comparison with the 120 s application, as shown in Figures 1−4 and S6. The nonmonotonic time-lapse dependence
of the field-induced increase in the fluorescence lifetime of NADH
following the application of an electric field may indicate a multistep
process of apoptosis under the application of PEFs. In the case of
STS-induced apoptosis, the fluorescence intensity of NADH increased
immediately just after the addition of 1 μM STS and continued
to increase until a certain time (∼70 min). After that, the
intensity saturated, as shown in Figure S6, which is different from the field effect on the NADH fluorescence
intensity given in Figure 5, particularly with the short pulse application.

In
terms of the origin of the field-induced increase of fluorescence
intensity, two possibilities can be considered. The first is a field-induced
increase in fluorescent NADH concentration; the second is a field-induced
increase in the fluorescence quantum yield of NADH. The fact that
the average fluorescence lifetime becomes longer in the presence of
the electric field indicates that the nonradiative decay at the emitting
state becomes slower in the presence of the electric field, that is,
the quantum yield of the NADH fluorescence increases after the application
of the electric field. As shown in Figure 5, the fluorescence intensity becomes higher
by a factor of more than 2 and 4 with a pulse width of 50 ns for the
application duration of 120 and 300 s, respectively, whereas the increase
in the lifetime is less than twice in both cases. These results show
that the field-induced increase in intensity cannot be explained only
by the increase in the fluorescence quantum yield. Therefore, there
is no doubt that the field-induced increase in fluorescence intensity
observed with a pulse width of 30 or 50 ns mainly results from the
field-induced increase in the number of fluorophores, that is, the
concentration of the emitting species of NADH is increased by the
application of the PEFs. When the pulse width is as short as 10 or
20 ns, and the field-induced change in fluorescence intensity is very
small, the concentration of the emitting species of NADH is not so
sensitive to the applied electric field. In every pulse width, however,
the fluorescence quantum yield is considered to increase in the presence
of electric fields because the fluorescence lifetime becomes longer
in their presence. As the pulse width becomes smaller, the ratio of
the fluorescence lifetime after the application of nsPEF relative
to the one before application becomes larger (see Figure 5b). These results suggest that
the field-induced enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield becomes
larger with decreasing pulse width, that is, the nonradiative decay
rate becomes slower with the application of nsPEF, and it is more
prominent as the pulse width becomes smaller. The decrease in the
nonradiative decay rate may indicate a shift in the population of
proteins to which cellular NADH is strongly bound, consistent with
a metabolism that is more efficient in ATP production. The field-induced
change in the fluorescence lifetime of NADH is considered to arise
from the physical effect: Intermolecular interactions of NADH with
surrounding amino acids of protein may be changed by the application
of electric fields, as an irreversible process. In fact, the change
in protein structure was reported to be induced by nsPEF using ricin,32 that is, the secondary structure of ricin was
slightly changed by nsPEF, resulting in the reduction of the toxicity
of ricin. We have previously shown that the fluorescence lifetime
of NADH has a tendency to increase with decreasing polar environment
around NADH, and the increase in the lifetime with binding to a protein
can also be explained in terms of the decrease in the hydrophilicity
of NADH.33 The present results also reflect
the change in the polar environment around NADH, which can be considered
to arise from the change in the interaction between NADH and a protein.

The fact that the NADH fluorescence spreads diffusely throughout
the cell after the application of nsPEF indicates that pores are opened
in the inner mitochondrial membranes, that is, the so-called mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (MPTP) complex, which may induce apoptosis,
is generated by the application of nsPEF,34 particularly when the pulse width of the applied electric field
is as large as 50 or 30 ns. Through the MPTPs produced in the inner
and outer mitochondrial membranes, NADH probably spreads into the
protoplasm from mitochondria. Membrane damage causes the leakage of
coenzymes such as NADH from mitochondria and their diffusion into
all parts of the cell, including the nucleus.35 With a large pulse width, both apoptosis and necrosis may be initiated.36 If only necrosis occurs, however, the fluorescence
lifetime of NADH is considered to be unaffected by the applied electric
field, as demonstrated by H2O2-induced necrosis.31 Therefore, it is likely that apoptosis is surely
induced by the applied electric fields with pulse widths of 50 and
30 ns, although the primary process of necrosis cannot be excluded
completely. In fact, a similar spread of NADH fluorescence throughout
the cell during early apoptotic stages has been reported in high-NaCl-induced
apoptosis of mIMCD3 cells.37 As the pulse
width of the applied electric field becomes smaller, the redistribution
of the NADH fluorescence intensity is inconspicuous, suggesting that
the MPTP is induced by the electric field whose pulse width is larger
than some threshold. Even with the short pulse width of 10 or 20 ns,
the field-induced lengthening of the lifetime of NADH fluorescence
was observed, indicating field-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells with
short pulse widths of 10 and 20 ns.

As mentioned, the fluorescence
lifetime shows a similar field effect
in every pulse width in the range of 10–50 ns, but the fluorescence
intensity shows different field dependence, that is, the field effect
on the fluorescence intensity remarkably depends on the pulse width
of the applied nsPEF. The intensity is largely enhanced by electric
fields with a pulse width of 50 or 30 ns, whereas the field effect
on the intensity is very small with a pulse width of 10 or 20 ns.
Furthermore, with 10 ns, the intensity decreases after the application
of electric fields. The energy saved in mitochondrial NADH is transferred
to an electrochemical proton gradient that is necessary to drive the
phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The electron transport process starts
with the oxidation of mitochondrial NADH to NAD+, and so
the redox ratio of NADH/NAD+ can be regarded as an indicator
of cellular metabolism.38 The autofluorescence
of NADH directly reflects the cellular metabolic state because the
oxidation of NADH to NAD+ via the electron transport chain
results in a characteristic loss of the NADH fluorescence signal.
As a potential origin of the field effect on fluorescence intensity
with 50 or 30 ns pulse width (i.e., the field-induced increase in
the concentration of fluorescent NADH), the depletion of energy metabolism
in mitochondria from the disruption of electron transport should be
considered.1 On the basis of the measurements
of the cytosolic ATP level in intact cells throughout the apoptotic
process, apoptotic stimuli such as STS and TNF-α were found
to induce significant enhancement of ATP levels, and it was suggested
that an elevation of cytosolic ATP level is a requisite to the apoptotic
cell death process.39 If so, the field-induced
enhancement in NADH fluorescence intensity would not come from the
field-induced increase in the ratio of NADH/NAD+ but, rather,
from the number of NADH molecules probably generated in the tricarboxylic
acid cycle, which may be significantly increased by the application
of PEFs with 50 or 30 ns pulse width.

Short pulses (10 ns) were
more effective in inducing membrane blebbing
compared to long pulses (50 ns) (cf. Figures S3 and S4). As mentioned, the effect of the PEF on subcellular
membranes depends on the charging time of the subcellular membranes.
If the pulse width of the applied electric field is shorter than the
charging time of the subcellular membrane, the electric field can
pass through the subcellular organelle membrane. Even when the charging
time of the mitochondrial inner membranes is longer than 20 ns, the
short pulses of 10 and 20 ns may pass through the outer and inner
membranes of mitochondria and activate or modify the proteins inside
the mitochondria very efficiently. The activation or modification
process may then lead to efficient apoptotic cell death. The present
results suggest that the nature of the apoptosis induced by the short
pulses of 10 and 20 ns is different from that induced by the long
pulses of 30 and 50 ns.

If a change in mitochondrial membrane
permeability is essential
for apoptosis,40 mitochondria outer-membrane
permeabilization (MOMP) may be induced by the application of the PEF,
and apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and an
apoptosis-inducing factor may be released into the cytosol.41 This would be true in the cases of 10 or 20
ns pulse width, where it is unlikely that MPTP is important. It is
well known that the release of cytochrome c from
mitochondria plays an important role in apoptosis. This mechanism
is mainly controlled by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, such as Bcl-2
(antiapoptotic) and Bak & Bax (proapoptotic), which are located
between the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria.42 It seems that nsPEFs either reduce the expression
of Bcl-2 or increase the expression of Bak and Bax. The disruption
of the mitochondrial membrane and the formation of pores by the PEF
should release cytochrome c from mitochondria. Therefore,
MOMP may play an important role in field-induced apoptosis by nsPEF
whose width is as short as 10 or 20 ns, irrespective of the caspase-dependent
and -independent mechanisms.41,43 Unfortunately, in the
present experiments it is not known whether the calcium ion is required
for nsPEF-induced apoptosis.18

It
is well recognized that mitochondria are a major source of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), such as single oxygen (1O2) and anionic superoxide (O2–), and
the production of 1O2 and O2– increases during the apoptosis.7−9,44 For example, it has been shown that STS-induced apoptosis
in HeLa cells is mainly mediated by the anionic superoxide (O2–).7 Thus, it
is conceivable that ROS production due to electron leakage in the
respiratory chain may induce the quenching of NADH autofluorescence.45 The dynamic quenching of fluorescent NADH by
ROS may be supported by the field-induced changes in NADH intensity
and lifetime under the application of PEFs. The lifetimes of both
fast and slow components observed after the 300 s application were
shorter than the corresponding ones observed after the first 120 s
application (see Table 1). However, the field-induced quenching of NADH fluorescence observed
after the application of a 10 ns PEF may be interpreted in terms of
static quenching of fluorescent NADH by ROS. At the moment, it is
not certain whether the concentration of NADH is significantly enhanced
by the application of electric fields with pulse widths as short as
10 or 20 ns.

Conclusions
Autofluorescence lifetime
images as well as intensity images of
the endogenous fluorophore of NADH were recorded in HeLa cells, before
and after the application of nsPEFs with a strength of 45 kV cm–1, a repetition rate of 1 kHz, and a pulse width of
10, 20, 30, or 50 ns. In every case, the fluorescence lifetime of
NADH became longer by applying nsPEFs, and further application induced
a decrease in the lifetime. This behavior was very similar to the
time-lapse dependence of the fluorescence lifetime of NADH in HeLa
cells observed after the addition of STS, a well-known apoptosis inducer.
Morphological changes in the cell structure were also induced by the
application of PEFs. These results show that apoptosis is induced
in HeLa cells by the application of nsPEFs having a pulse width in
the range of 10–50 ns. The magnitude of the field-induced change
in lifetime, as well as the field-induced change in morphology, became
larger when the pulse width of the applied electric field was reduced.
These findings indicate that field-induced apoptosis becomes more
efficient with decreased pulse widths of the applied electric fields,
with the field strength remaining the same, likely because electric
fields with a short pulse width can penetrate deeply into the mitochondria
and initiate apoptosis more efficiently. When the pulse width of the
applied electric field is as large as 30 or 50 ns, the fluorescence
intensity increases with the applied electric field and its magnitude
monotonically increases with increasing application duration. Furthermore,
the intensity distribution spreads over the entire region of each
cell. MPTP induced by the applied electric field probably plays a
significant role in the initiation of apoptosis with a pulse width
as large as 50 or 30 ns. As the pulse width becomes smaller, the magnitude
of the field-induced change in intensity becomes smaller, and the
intensity decreases when the pulse width is as small as 10 ns. With
such a short pulse width, MOMP, which induces a release of apoptotic
factors and activates the apoptotic process, may occur. At the same
time, ROS may be produced by the field-induced leakage of electrons
from the respiratory chain during electron transfer to molecular oxygen,
and the produced ROS may induce the quenching of NADH fluorescence.
Fluorescence lifetime and intensity images observed before and after
the application of PEFs suggest that nsPEF-induced apoptosis could
be caused by two mechanisms depending on the applied nsPEF pulse width.

Methods
Biochip
Fabrication
Microchannel bioelectric chips
were fabricated on microscopic cover glasses using the UV photolithographic
method. Microwall arrays of microchannels were produced by SU-8, 2015
negative photoresist (Micro Chem) by the exposure of UV light.25 After the chemical treatments, the array of
photoresist microchannels could be produced. The Au layer was then
deposited twice (35 nm each) at +30° and −30°, respectively,
with respect to the substrate, to cover the sidewalls of the photoresist
microchannels by helicon sputtering (MPS-4000c1/HC1; ULVAC, Japan).
Finally, the resultant electrode microchannels were immersed in acetone
for 10–15 min. The ultrasonic treatment was used to take out
the gold film from the undesired area of the substrate. The width
and depth of the microchannels were about 100 ± 1 and 20 ±
1 μm, respectively, as shown in Figure S7. The living cells were cultured between the microchannels. In this
study, nsPEFs having durations of 10, 20, 30, and 50 ns were applied
with a voltage of 450 V and a load resistance of 50 Ω, which
correspond to a field strength of 45 kV cm–1 for
an interelectrode distance of 100 μm using a pulse generator
(Avtech Electrosystems Ltd.). The internal field factor was taken
as unity.

Cell Culture
HeLa cells were cultured in the fabricated
biochips at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, D5796; Sigma) supplemented with 2 × 105 U dm–3 penicillin G, 200 mg of streptomycin sulfate,
and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
The cell culture medium was replaced with calcium- and magnesium-free
phosphate buffered saline medium just before the measurements.

Autofluorescence
Intensity and Lifetime Imaging
Measurements
of endogenous NADH intensity and lifetime images of cultured cells
before and after the application of the PEFs were carried out by an
inverted microscope (TE2000E; Nikon, Japan) through the objective
lens (40×) using a time-correlated single photon counting system
(SPC-830; Becker & Hickl GmbH).25 The
second harmonic output at 380 nm from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser
(Tsunami, Spectra Physics, pulse duration of about 80 fs, repetition
rate of 81 MHz) was used as the excitation light for NADH. The autofluorescence
signal of NADH was detected using a microchannel-plate photomultiplier
tube in the region of 447–460 nm. The analysis of the collected
data was done with SPC image software (Becker & Hickl GmbH). The
observed fluorescence decays were fitted by a convolution of the instrumental
response function with a multiexponential decay.

Fluorescence
images were initially observed before the application of the electric
field, with two other image measurements taken to examine the electric-field
effect. The PEFs with four different pulse widths of 10, 20, 30, and
50 ns with the same strength (45 kV cm–1) and repetition
rate of 1 kHz were used. The first image measurement was taken following
the application of the above-mentioned electric field for 120 s. After
that, the same PEF was further applied for 180 s and the second image
measurement was taken, that is, the image measurements were done after
field application duration of 120 and 300 s, respectively. The acquisition
time of the images was fixed at 20 min in every case.
