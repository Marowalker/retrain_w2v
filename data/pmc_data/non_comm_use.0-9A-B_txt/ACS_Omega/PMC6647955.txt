Zeolite faujasite is widely used
as a catalyst in many industrial
catalytic applications. In this study, synthesis and characterization
of magnetic zeolite Y–palladium–nickel ferrite were
studied. First, palladium nanoparticles were combined with nickel
ferrite and then placed on zeolite Y by ultrasonic treatment. The
structure and morphology of the synthesized magnetic zeolite Y–palladium–nickel
ferrite were characterized using Fourier transform infrared, X-ray
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
energy-dispersive X-ray, vibrating sample magnetometer, and inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis. Also, we investigated
the catalytic activity of this prepared zeolite in Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling reaction between phenylboronic acid and aryl halides. Our
study shows that magnetic zeolite Y–palladium–nickel
ferrite is a suitable catalyst for Suzuki–Miyaura coupling
reaction. Short reaction time, high yield, and easy reusability are
the advantages of using this catalyst in carbon–carbon cross-coupling
reactions.

1 Introduction
Zeolites
are microporous aluminosilicate materials with a large
number of open channels, pores, and cages that are distributed on
a molecular scale with a high mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability.1 There are reports about various applications
of zeolites such as ion-exchange, catalysis, adsorptive separation,
renewable energy, and in biomedical devices.2−7 One of the most studied zeolites, Na-Y (Z-Y), has been widely used
as an industrial catalyst for several important processes, such as
membranes8 and catalytic conversions.9 The crystalline structure of zeolite Y is the
result of the spatial connection between silicate and aluminate units
that can build 12-member ring pores (7.4 Å). These pores join
together to form super cavities.10

Recently, there is a lot of interest in the use of
microwave and ultrasonic energies. Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic
radiation with frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 300 GHz. The microwave
method is extensively applied in different fields such as dehydration
of solid compounds, medicine, and formation of inorganic materials.11 Also, ultrasonic wave is a kind of mechanical
energy, which is characterized by vibrating particles in a medium
with a frequency greater than 20 000 Hz. When ultrasonic waves
pass through a solution, local high temperatures and high pressures
are created. These results lead to the generation of microscopic cavities
that grow. After that, these bubbles collapse in order to release
a great local energy, for the formation or breaking of chemical bonds.12 There are many reports about the use of ultrasound
as a green source of energy in the preparation of micrometer-sized
molecular sieves.13−19 Compared with the common hydrothermal synthesis, the preparation
of materials using microwaves and ultrasonic waves has benefits such
as rapid reaction, narrow particle size distribution, and wide synthesis
of compounds having a high degree of purity.20

The nickel ferrite (NF) compound, NiFe2O4, is a well-known inverse spinel including Ni2+ and Fe3+ ions distributed between the octahedral and tetrahedral
sites, respectively.21 There are many reports
about the use of nickel ferrite such as biomedical, electric, and
electronic devices, ferro-fluids, magnetic refrigeration, color imaging,
and microwave devices.22−25 Also, there are many techniques like citric acid combustion, organic
gel-thermal decomposition, sol–gel autocombustion, hydrothermal
process, thermolysis, co-precipitation, gel-assistant hydrothermal
process, self-propagation, and use of microemulsion for the preparation
of nanocrystallite NF.26−28 Amongst the reported techniques for the preparation
of NF nanostructures, the microwave technique has gathered the most
attention because of some benefits such as feasibility, inexpensiveness,
environmental friendliness, and short reaction time.29

The palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura (S–M)
carbon–carbon
cross-coupling reaction between an aryl halide and phenylboronic acid
(benzeneboronic acid) is among the most powerful tools for constructing
C–S, C–N, and C–C bonds in the synthesis of organic
compounds.30 As biaryl derivatives are
applied as the building block of a vast range of natural products,
herbicides, polymers, and pharmaceuticals, much efforts have been
spent on the development of simple and practical conditions for doing
the S–M coupling reaction.31,32 There are
many catalytic systems limited to the couplings of aryl iodides and
aryl bromides.33 Recently, the use of available
aryl chlorides and aryl fluorides in these transformations have received
a lot of interesting, and a number of effective catalysts have been
developed for this aim.34 Generally, most
of the phosphine ligands used in palladium-catalyzed processes are
harmful, expensive, and air- or water-sensitive.35 Also, the Pd-based bimetallic nanostructures with some
low-cost elements such as Co, Fe, and Ni as the novel catalysts present
excellent stability, selectivity, and performance in different organic
reactions.36,37 In some cases, the catalytic
performance of non-noble metals can be increased by the use of ultrafine
polyacrylonitrile fibers38 and zeolite39 or some phosphine ligands40 as stabilizers.

Recently, we reported S–M
cross-coupling reactions between
aryl halides and benzeneboronic acid in the presence of zeolite Y/palladium
nanoparticles as a catalyst.41

In
this study, for the first time, the preparation and characterization
of magnetic zeolite Y–palladium–nickel ferrite (Z-Y–Pd–NF)
by ultrasonic treatment are reported. In this route, the crystallization
temperature and synthesis time are shorter than in other methods.
This catalyst displays three main advantages in the S–M reaction.
(1) The contact between the reactants and the catalyst increase considerably
because of having a high active surface area. (2) It is easily separated
from the mixture of reaction by applying an external magnet because
of insolubility and paramagnetic properties of the Z-Y–Pd–NF
composite. (3) The Z-Y–Pd–NF shows high performance
in carbon–carbon coupling reactions. Other advantages of the
use of the prepared catalyst in S–M coupling reactions are
rapid reaction, suitable yield, and reusability.

2 Results
and Discussion
In this study, the preparation of a magnetic
catalyst, Z-Y–Pd–NF,
via ultrasonic treatment has been demonstrated, which can be suitable
for S–M cross-coupling reactions (Figure 1). First, Z-Y was synthesized by the sonochemical
method. Second, NF NPs were synthesized using facile and fast microwave
radiation. Then, ultrasonic treatment was used to deposit Pd and NF
NPs on the Z-Y surface. Figure 2 displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern with sharp reflections
at 2θ of 6.08°, 10.04°, 11.7°, 13.48°, 15.5°,
20.2°, 23.4°, 26.8°, and 31.1° belong to 111,
220, 311, 331, 511, 440, 533, 642, and 555 planes of the Z-Y structure.
According to Figure 2, there are no impurities in this compound, which proves the Z-Y
phase.41

Figure 2 XRD pattern of Z-Y.

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum and scanning
electron
microscopy (SEM) image of the prepared Z-Y are presented in Figure 3. This synthesized
zeolite shows the characteristic bands of the faujasite (FAU) framework.
The appeared bands at 567 and 719 cm–1 are assigned
to the bending and symmetric stretching vibrations of Si–O
or Al–O bonds, respectively. Also, the band at 1002 cm–1 is ascribed to the Al–O tetrahedral vibration
(Figure 3a). The small
cavities on the external surface of Z-Y with uniform structure are
observed in the SEM image as given in Figure 3b. Figure 3c shows a histogram of particle size distribution with
the average particle size of 76 nm for the prepared Z-Y. According
to these results, the structure and morphology of the prepared Z-Y
were completely performed after 3 h by ultrasonic irradiation.

(b) SEM image, and (c) histogram of particle
size distribution of the prepared Z-Y.

Figure 4a–c
reveals FT-IR spectra, SEM image, and the histogram of particle size
distribution of the synthesized NF NPs under microwave radiation.
Three different times for the synthesis of NF NPs were investigated
(10, 20, and 30 min). The best time for the synthesis of NF NPs was
30 min [monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC)]. According to Figure 4a(i), the C–O
bending vibrations of NF NPs were observed in the range of 1380–1420
cm–1. Additionally, the appeared peaks at 470 and
560 cm–1 correspond to Ni–O and Fe–O,
respectively.42 The morphology of the product
was examined by an SEM image (Figure 4b). It seems the agglomeration of particles had occurred
because of the high magnetism of NF NPs. Furthermore, the average
particle size is 58 nm for NF NPs (Figure 4c).

different times (i
= 10 min, ii = 20 min and iii = 30 min), (b) SEM image of the synthesized
NF NPs via microwave (360 W, 30 min) and (c) histogram of particle
size distribution of NF NPs.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the NF NPs
are
given in Figure 5.
According to the TEM images, NF NPs have a core–shell structure
with the average diameter size from ∼40 to ∼60 nm.

The XRD pattern of NF NPs shows that the final
product has a good
match with the crystalline system of the cubic phase related to JCPDS
card no. 01-088-0380 (Figure 6). The diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 18.44°,
30.33°, 35.72°, 37.36°, 43.39°, 53.85°, 57.40°,
and 63.03° belong to 111, 220, 311, 222, 400, 422, 511, and 440
planes of the NF phase. According to the XRD pattern, the pure phase
of NF has been synthesized and there are no impurities in this compound.

Figure 6 XRD pattern
of the prepared NF NPs.

The magnetic property of NF NPs was investigated by a vibrating
sample magnetometer at 300 K. As shown in Figure 7, the magnetic hysteresis curve of NF NPs
reveals a super-paramagnetic behavior.43 Its saturation magnetization value is 41.5 emu g–1. Therefore, this magnetic material is separable using an external
permanent magnet from the reaction solution.

Figure 7 Magnetization curve of
the prepared magnetic NF NPs.

The characterization of the magnetic catalyst, Z-Y–Pd–NF,
was investigated as a suitable candidate in S–M carbon–carbon
coupling reaction. The FT-IR spectrum and SEM image of the prepared
Z-Y–Pd–NF via ultrasonic treatment have been given in Figure 8. Three sharp peaks
have been observed at 451, 730, and 1074 cm–1, which
belong to T–O (T = Si, Al, Ni), T–O (T = Si, Fe), and
Al–O tetrahedral vibrations, respectively (Figure 8a).44 Because the vibration peaks of Fe and Ni are near the range of 400–800
cm–1, these peaks overlap with the peaks of Z-Y.
The morphology of Z-Y–Pd–NF is resembling a rose flower
as shown in Figure 8b,c.

Figure 8 (a) FT-IR spectrum, (b,c) SEM images of the synthesized Z-Y–Pd–NF
by the ultrasonic method.

The XRD pattern of Z-Y–Pd–NF is given in Figure 9. There are a number
of prominent Bragg reflections with indices [(111), (200), and (311)],
which clearly reveal that the resultant product is Pd(0).45 In addition, there are sharp reflections at
2θ of 10.1°, 12.4°, 13.51°, 20.07°, 21.59°,
26.86°, 27.71°, 28.6°, 30.07°, and 33.2°
that confirm the Z-Y presence.41 The diffraction
peaks at 2θ of 18.40°, 30.29°, 35.8°, 37.32°,
43.31°, 53.6°, 57.38°, and 62.99° prove the existence
of NF NPs.43 The elemental analysis of
Z-Y–Pd–NF were carried out by energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) study and clearly displayed Pd, Ni, and Fe existence (Figure 10). In addition,
the elemental analysis of Pd, Ni, and Fe were determined as 0.05,
0.12, and 0.15 mol % by inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP–OES), respectively.

Z-Y–Pd–NF.

Figure 11 displays
TEM images of the prepared Z-Y–Pd–NF. This sample has
a shell–core structure as well as the prepared NF NPs.

of the prepared Z-Y–Pd–NF (a,b) with core–shell
structure.

Figure 12 reveals
the magnetization curve of Z-Y–Pd–NF. Accordingly, the
saturation magnetization for Z-Y–Pd–NF is equal to 5.01
emu g–1. This study proves the paramagnetic behavior
of the catalyst because of the presence of magnetic nanoparticles
on the zeolite surface. The saturation magnetization of Z-Y–Pd–NF
is considerably lower than that of the bulk magnetite because of the
low amount of NF NPs dispersed on the zeolite surface.

2.1 Catalytic Evaluation
Carbon–carbon
bond formation is one of the most fundamental reactions for the construction
of molecular frameworks in organic chemistry. Therefore, first, the
effect of temperature in the S–M catalytic system was studied
(Table 1). According
to Table 1, when the
temperature is 80 °C, better catalytic performance of Z-Y–Pd–NF
is obtained in the product.

In addition,
a solvent plays an important role in improving the
rate of this coupling reaction. Therefore, several experiments were
carried out to find the best solvent for the S–M coupling reaction
(Table 2). A high yield
was achieved with the H2O/EtOH (1:1) solvent. The other
solvents, namely, EtOH, H2O, DMF, DMSO, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran
(THF), had lower yields in comparison to H2O/EtOH. It was
found that the least yield was obtained when THF was utilized as the
solvent. Potassium carbonate, K2CO3, was selected
as the base for optimizing the conditions of the reaction.

ICP–OES elemental analysis
shows that the amounts of Pd,

the amount of catalyst, Z-Y–Pd–NF, the reaction of bromobenzene
with benzeneboronic acid in the H2O/EtOH solvent system
at 80 °C was considered. Therefore, the optimal amount of the
catalyst is 0.01 mol % (Table 3).

There are three fundamental
steps for the S–M carbon–carbon
coupling reaction: oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive
elimination as demonstrated in Figure 13. Oxidative addition is the rate-determining
step in the catalytic cycle and the relative reactivity decreases
in the order of I > OTf > Br > Cl. A pathway for the activation
of
the catalyst is proposed as in Figure 13. First, Pd(0) nanoparticles were placed
on the surface of zeolite Y by the reaction between PdCl2 and zeolite Y in the presence of ultrasonic waves. The pathway for
reducing palladium ions is organic radicals as per the following reactions 1–3 1   2   3  

Figure 13 General catalytic cycle for the S–M
cross-coupling via Z-Y–Pd–NF.

Rehspringer reported that ultrasonic waves can reduce some
metals
like Pd(II) and Pt(II).46 Thus, initially
Pd(0) converts into a Pd(II) complex in an oxidative addition step
(intermediate 1 in Figure 13). Under the participation of a base, phenyl boronic acid
reacts with intermediate 1 in transmetalation to afford intermediate
2. This is followed by reductive elimination to give the desired product
and regenerate the original Pd(0) species.

This study shows
that aryl iodides (entries 1, 4) and aryl bromides
(entries 2, 5) can easily react with phenylbronic acid. However, aryl
chlorides (entries 3, 6, 7, and 9) and aryl fluoride (entry 8) react
slowly with phenylbronic acid. Furthermore, the aryl halides having
electron-withdrawing groups can efficiently couple with phenylboronic
acid in comparison to aryl halides containing electron-donating groups
with phenylboronic acid. Interestingly, Z-Y–Pd–NF causes
the reaction between a deactivated 4-CNC6H4F
and phenylboronic acid (entry 8) to occur with 62% of yield. To the
best our knowledge a few catalysts can react with aryl fluorides.
In the oxidative addition step, adding palladium into a C–X
bond occurs in the order I > Br > Cl > F, based mainly on
the strength
of the C–X bond.47 Considering the
abovementioned reaction protocol, this magnetic catalyst can be applicable
to a wide range of aryl halides in all cases.

The reaction of
chlorobenzene with phenylboronic acid in this study
has been compared with a number of noble metal-based compounds presented
in recent investigations on S–M reactions (Table 5). The catalytic performance
of the synthesized Z-Y–Pd–NF by the ultrasonic method
is very good because of short times and more yields in comparison
with other catalysts. For example, when Fe3O4/P (GMA-AA-MMA)–Pd (entry 7) has been used as a catalyst,
the yield of the final product is 9% after 3.0 h, but our catalyst
shows 83% yield after 2.0 h. In another comparison, when PdPtZn (entry
4) has been used, CTAB has been applied as a stabilizer for catalyst
stability, but in this work no stabilizer has been applied.

Nowadays, catalyst recycling in the synthesis of organic compounds
has received chemists’ attention. Therefore, the recycling
of the prepared catalyst, Z-Y–Pd–NF, in the modified
S–M reaction of phenylboronic acid with bromobenzene is considered
and the findings are given in Figure 14. Upon completion of each reaction, the solid catalyst
is separated by applying an external magnet, washed with ethyl acetate,
and reused without further purification. According to Figure 14, no significant loss of catalytic
activity is observed after eight consecutive reactions for magnetic
Z-Y–Pd–NF.

3 Conclusions
In this study, a suitable,
green energy procedure, sonochemistry,
was used to synthesize magnetic Z-Y–Pd–NF. The advantages
of this method are application of green energy, short time synthesis
of Z-Y–Pd–NF, and creation of regular zeolite with a
uniform structure and cavities. The structure and properties of Z-Y–Pd–NF
were characterized by various techniques. To investigate the performance
of Z-Y–Pd–NF, it was used in the S–M coupling
reaction as a catalyst. The Z-Y–Pd–NF showed excellent
efficiency in carbon–carbon cross-coupling reactions and interestingly,
fluorobenzene could react with phenylboronic acid in the presence
of this catalyst. Other advantages of using Z-Y–Pd–NF
in S–M carbon–carbon coupling reactions are short reaction
time, high yield, and easy recoverability. More importantly, catalyst
recycling is easily achieved using a permanent magnet.

4 Experimental Section
All of the chemicals were purchased
from Merck Company and used
without further purification. Microwave radiation was obtained by
a domestic microwave oven (LG, Model: MC-3223CS/00, power: 360 W)
at atmosphere pressure. Ultrasonic generation was carried out by an
ultrasonic instrument (FAPA, Model: UP400) with a standard probe.
The powder X-ray diffraction was performed by a STOE-STADV instrument
(Cu Kα = 1.5418 Å). SEM images were obtained using TESCAN
and ZEISS (Sigma VP-WDS detector) instruments. TEM images were obtained
using a Zeiss-EM10C-100 kV instrument. FT-IR spectra were recorded
with a Shimadzu spectrometer (KBr pellets) from 400 to 4000 cm–1. ICP–OES was obtained by a VISTA-PRO instrument. 1H NMR spectra of products were taken with a Bruker 400 MHz
ultrashield spectrometer using CDCl3 and TMS as the solvent
and internal standard, respectively.

4.1 Synthesis

Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.8 g) and
Ni(NO3)2·5H2O (0.3 g) as metal
sources, NH2CH2COOH (0.23 g) as a fuel and organic
driving agent, and NH4NO3 (0.48 g) as an oxidizer
were used for this part of the synthesis. These materials were mixed
and transferred into a domestic microwave oven with a power of 360
W for 30 min. The resulting compound was collected, washed several
times with ethanol and distilled water for removal of the residual
initial materials, and dried at 70 °C for 24 h. Finally, the
dark brown color NF powder was obtained.55

4.2 Synthesis of Magnetic Z-Y–Pd–NF
First, Z-Y was produced using a starting aluminosilicate gel with
a molar ratio of 1 Al2O3/4 Na2O/9
SiO2/170 H2O. Then, H–Y zeolite was obtained
by ion exchange of Z-Y with a solution of ammonium chloride (1 M,
4 h, and 80 °C), which we have reported in our previous paper.41 The product was filtered and washed with distilled
water. After that, it was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and then calcined
at 500 °C in a furnace. This prepared sample was added to a 100
mL round-bottom flask containing 50 mL of EtOH, 0.05 g of PdCl2, and 0.05 g of NF. This mixture was transferred to an ultrasonic
device (1 h, 150 W). After that, the final product was filtered, washed,
and dried overnight at 100 °C. The yield of Z-Y–Pd–NF
was obtained at 85 wt % (0.85 g).
