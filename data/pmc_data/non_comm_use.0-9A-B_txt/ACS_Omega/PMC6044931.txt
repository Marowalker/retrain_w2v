Three tobacco types
(Burley, Flue Cured, and Oriental) and eight
cigarette brands were unequivocally identified using an electronic
nose formed by only three sensors based on a single novel conducting
polymer (PF-BTB) doped with different porphyrins (H2TPP, H2TPFP, and H2BTBOP). The synthesis and characterization
of the polymer are also discussed. Small changes in the porphyrin
structure caused significant changes in the electrical conductance
response patterns of the sensors upon exposure to complex chemical
matrixes, representing a novel approach for tuning the selectivity
of chemiresistive sensors for e-nose application. This e-nose is fast,
cheap, reliable, can be easily operated, and could be a valuable tool
for border agents fighting cigarette smuggling around the world, helping
them prevent losses of millions in tax revenues and sales.

1 Introduction
Fraudulent
imitation of commercial products such as cigarettes
is a problem worldwide. In Brazil, the cigarette industry and the
government lose yearly millions in sales and tax revenue because of
such illegal activity.1 Usually, a visual
inspection performed by a trained agent is not enough to identify
counterfeiting, requiring an auxiliary analytical method to support
an apprehension. In Brazil, the vast majority of counterfeit cigarettes
enter the country via land borders and, because they are normally
located in remote areas (frequently dense forests), a cheap, rapid,
and portable system is necessary to help border agents in the task.
Electronic noses (e-noses) come as a reasonable choice to meet all
of these requirements.

e-Noses have been used to identify a
great variety of analytes
since their development in 1982.2 This
powerful tool has assisted many fields of knowledge, from medicine
to chemistry, being applied in distinct situations, such as wine-quality
inspection,3 tuberculosis diagnosis,4 characterization of juices,5 and differentiation of aromatic flowers.6 Food analysis is one of the most reported in literature,7 and the reason for that lies on the fact that
most products in this industry come from animal or vegetal sources,
therefore containing a great variety of chemical compounds in their
composition. This complexity challenges traditional analytical methods
but, on the other hand, gives a perfect kind of matrix e-noses that
are needed to perform a reliable differentiation.

e-Noses work
with an array of sensors, each of them capable of
changing its behavior differently when exposed to volatile substances
released by analytes. These responses together produce a pattern that
is sent to a single processing system and, to provide a good identification,
it must be unique to each of the analyzed aromas.8 Sensors of different nature, relying on different chemical
and physical phenomena, can play this role in the e-nose apparatus.
Despite their different nature, they all aim at creating a pattern
to identify the volatile compounds they are exposed to.9 Among the most popular types are polymeric sensors,
composed by a doped conductive polymer layer, which is capable of
changing its conductivity when exposed to organic vapors.10 Some advantages of this material are room-temperature
operation, low power consumption, fast responses, high selectivity,
and virtually unlimited possible polymeric structures.11 The polymeric thin film deposited on the surface
of these sensors interacts with the incoming vapors, which causes
a conformational change in the structure. This phenomenon affects
the conductivity observed and is specific to each type of matrix analyzed,
forming the physical basis for the detection of compounds.12 A further discussion of the detection mechanism
has been previously published.15

Cigarette brand and tobacco analyses by e-noses have been reported
in the literature using different sensors (e.g., metal oxide semiconductors
and conductive polymer/carbon black)13 and
other techniques;14 however, the complexity
of these e-noses systems is higher when compared to the methodology
discussed herein, employing 6 to 32 different sensors to perform these
analyses. In a previous paper,15 we first
reported a new type of composite layer to be used in e-noses: a single
conductive polymer had its chemiresistive behavior modulated by chemical
interaction with different porphyrins, generating independent analytical
signals and, therefore, producing a rich pattern for each analyte
studied. As a proof of concept, an e-nose formed by these three sensors
was used for classifying four volatile organic solvents (propanone,
ethanol, ethyl acetate, and toluene). To further explore this idea
and solve a real analytical problem, this work was focused on testing
a far more complex system, tobaccos and cigarettes, analyzing the
volatile compounds released by these samples. Also, a novel conductive
polymer, PF-BTB, was synthesized, characterized, and
employed for this task, showing the versatility of this active layer
system.

2 Results and Discussion
A three-sensor
array was initially used to identify the three most
common tobacco types produced in Brazil: Burley, Flue Cured, and Oriental.
This experiment was planned to test the e-nose system and opened the
possibility to more complex approaches, carried out afterward. The
outputs registered in these experiments are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Conductance outputs.
A: Burley; B: Flue Cured; and C: Oriental.

The data were mathematically processed to calculate the relative
response (Ra) parameter to each exposure/recovery
cycle for each analyzed tobacco. The Ra parameter expresses the interaction between the sensor and the volatiles
released by the analyte. G1 and G2 represent, respectively, the absolute conductance
measured immediately before and after the exposure (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Response pattern and Ra calculation. ton = V1 and V2 on and V3 off; toff = V1
and V2 off and V3 on. For V1, V2, and V3, see Figure 11.

Calculated (Ra)s for the last
six peaks
in each graph, as shown in Figure 1, were plotted in a three-dimensional scatter (Figure 3), revealing three
well-separated clusters that provided an outstanding classification.

Figure 3 Plot of
the relative responses (Ra)s
for tobacco types.

On the basis of the good
selectivity observed in Figure 3, the e-nose was subjected
to a more complex test: screening eight different cigarette brands
(Table 1) under the
same conditions. Figure 4 shows two outputs as an example (one for each supplier; please see
the supporting information for the complete set of conductance outputs).

Employing the same mathematical procedure
described in Figure 2, a new three-dimensional
scatter was plotted and, again, a very good clustering is observed,
despite the number of brands analyzed (Figure 5).

3 Conclusions
The results presented in this
work showed a very efficient e-nose
based on composite sensors. The scope of its application was considerably
expanded from simple compounds (organic solvents) to very complex
chemical matrixes, presented herein. A new conductive polymer, PF-BTB, combined in pairs with porphyrins H2TPP, H2TPFP, or H2BTBOP, generated three autonomous
sensors and a fully functional e-nose array. The behavior of these
pairs demonstrated their different nature, as only three distinct
sensors would be capable of performing a very complicated identification
involving eight chemically similar analytes (Figure 5). This result suggests an intimate molecular
relationship between conductive polymers and porphyrins, showing that
substitutions in these macrocyclic structures lead to substantial
changes in the chemiresistive behavior of these pairs.

The analytical
procedure proposed is fast, cheap, reliable and,
above all, user friendly, which are all features essential to field
applications carried out by border patrols fighting cigarette smuggling.
The selectivity achieved broadens the application of this system to
a great variety of brands and could make this method a valuable tool
to differentiate genuine cigarettes from counterfeit products crossing
every day national borders around the world.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Solvents and Reagents
Commercial
grade dimethylformamide (DMF; Aldrich) was dried over anhydrous CuSO4 for 2 days and then distilled at 44–45 °C (25
mmHg) using a 40 cm Vigreux column and stored over freshly dried 4
Å molecular sieves.

Commercial grade chloroform (Synth)
was heated under reflux over phosphorous pentoxide for 5 h, distilled
at 58–60 °C (710 mmHg), and stored over freshly dried
4 Å molecular sieves.

Bromine (Aldrich) was shaken with
concentrated H2SO4 1:1 (v/v) before use.

All other commercial chemicals were used as received (Aldrich).

4.2 Synthesis of PF-BTB
Poly(9,9-n-octyl-2,7-fluorenylenevinylene-alt-4,7-dibenzothiadiazole-2,5-thiophene), PF-BTB (5), was designed to be a low band gap
polymer containing
fluorene, thiophene, and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units, which have
previously successfully produced low band gap polymers in similar
structures.16 The synthesis was carried
out via Heck polymerization, following the synthetic pathway, as shown
below (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route toward PF-BTB
4-Bromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (1),17 2,5-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)thiophene
(2),18 and 9,9-dioctyl-2,7-divinyl-9H-fluorene (4) were synthesized according to
literature procedures.16b

4.2.1 2,5-Bis(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl)thiophene
(3)
A solution containing 2,5-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)thiophene (2) (1.44 g, 2.17
mmol), 4-bromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 94% (1) (1.00 g,
4.37 mmol), PdCl2(PPh3)2 (0.03 g,
0.05 mmol), and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) was stirred under
reflux for 5 h. The resulting mixture was washed with distilled water,
and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with CH2Cl2. The organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated under vacuum. The residue was purified by flash-column
chromatography with (3:2 n-hexane/CHCl3) as eluent to afford 0.680 g (1.92 mmol) of an orange solid (η
= 88%). mp 180–183 °C (188–189 °C19).

1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.18 (s, 2H), 7.90–7.94 (m, 4H), 7.62 (t, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H).

13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ 155.6,
152.2, 140.5, 129.7, 128.8, 127.4, 125.5, 120.4.

4.2.2 Polymerization (PF-BTB) (5)
Br2 (34 μL, 0.67 mmol) dissolved
in CHCl3 was added dropwise to a stirred solution of 2,5-bis(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl)thiophene (3) (0.10
g, 0.28 mmol), FeCl3 (0.90 mg, 5.6 μmol), and CHCl3 (10 mL). The mixture was refluxed for 5 h, forming the brominated
monomer BTB as an insoluble orange solid that was filtrated, washed
with distilled water, and dried under vacuum overnight [1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.17 (s, 2H), 7.90 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.79 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H)].
Then, (0.10 g, 0.19 mmol) of this product was added without further
purification to a reaction vessel containing 9,9-dioctyl-2,7-divinyl-9H-fluorene (4) (0.08 g, 0.19 mmol), P(o-tol)3 (0.03 g, 0.10 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (3.8 mg, 0.02 mmol), triethylamine (1 mL), and 8 mL of anhydrous
DMF. The mixture was degassed with anhydrous N2 and heated
to 90 °C for 48 h. The polymer was precipitated by adding 80
mL of methanol, filtrated, and dried under vacuum. The solid was washed,
in sequence, with methanol and hexane for 1 h each using a Soxhlet
apparatus. The liquids were discarded, and then the resulting solid
was extracted thoroughly with chloroform during 24 h. The chloroform
was evaporated affording 0.09 g of a black solid (η = 43% over
two steps). Gel permeation chromatography analysis using polystyrene
as the standard revealed that the weight-average molecular weight
for PF-BTB is 2.9 kDa.

4.3 Characterization
of PF-BTB
The polymer was initially characterized
by UV–vis spectroscopy
using a dilute chloroform solution (6 mg/L) (Figure 6).

Figure 6 PF-BTB UV–vis absorption
spectrum in chloroform
solution.

The absorption spectrum shows
two strong bands: the first one at
250–400 nm, representing πdelocalized–πlocalized* and πlocalized–πdelocalized* transitions, and the second one in the
425–620 nm range, representing π–π* transitions
for π electron states delocalized along the polymer chain.20 The polymer optical band gap (Eg) estimated from the absorption edge is 2.0 eV (620 nm).

The infrared spectrum was registered using KBr pellets and is shown
in Figure 7. The tentative
assignment of the most significant bands is listed in Table 2.

The bands at 963 and 3006 cm–1 reveal that the
Heck polymerization formed trans-double bonds between the two monomeric
units in PF-BTB.

A PF-BTB sample was
casted onto an indium tin oxide-coated
glass electrode which was used as the working electrode in a cyclic
voltammetry experiment performed in a 0.2 M solution of LiClO4 in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV/s, from −0.2
to 2.5 V, using a Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. Figure 8 shows a well-defined oxidation peak starting at 1.16
V [highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy] with a maximum
at 1.45 V. Using the optical band gap, the reduction potential can
be estimated at −0.84 V [lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) energy].

solution,

4.4 Porphyrins Syntheses
meso-Tetra(phenyl)porphyrin (H2TPP) (6),22meso-tetra(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (H2TPFP) (7),23 and 5,15-({3,5-bis(isopentyloxy)benzene}porphyrin)
(H2BTBOP) (8)24 (Figure 9) were synthesized according to literature
procedures.

Figure 9 Synthesized porphyrins, H2TPP (6), H2TPFP (7), and H2BTBOP (8).

4.5 Sensors Preparation
Stock solutions
containing 2.5 mg of PF-BTB, 0.72 μmol of each
free-base porphyrin (H2TPP, H2BTBOP, or H2TPFP), and
0.75 mL of chloroform were prepared. These solutions (20 μL)
were deposited by spin-coating onto interdigitated electrodes (1 cm2, 18 μm gap between digits),16c,25 generating polymeric films of ≈1 μm thickness (Figure 10). The sensors
were used over 1 week, showing no signs of decomposition or significant
decrease in the conductivity observed.

4.6 e-Nose Apparatus
The e-nose system
for dynamic sampling used in this work was entirely built in our laboratory
and is shown, as a schematic representation, in Figure 11. A complete measure cycle is composed by an exposure phase
(valves 1 and 2 open and valve 3 closed), when the sample headspace
is carried to the sensors’ chamber, and a recovery phase (valves
1 and 2 closed and valve 3 open), when ambient air passes through
the sensors. Each analyte was kept in the sample compartment at 30
°C during the whole experiment, and the airflow was maintained
at 0.6 L·min–1. For all analytes, the exposure
(10 s)/recovery (180 s) cycle was repeated 10 times, and the four
initial peaks were disconsidered. The conductance was registered by
a conductivity meter,26 operating with
80 mV peak-to-peak 2 kHz triangle wave ac voltage, and connected via
a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter to a personal computer. The sensors
do not require any type of cleaning or preparation between samples.

4.7 Sample Preparation
Burley, Flue Cured,
and Oriental tobacco leaves, subjected to the same postharvest processing,
were obtained from a national producer from Vale do Rio Pardo region,
state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and grinded until the resulting
aspect matched the tobacco found in cigarettes. All cigarettes were
obtained from local suppliers, and the tobacco contained in a single
cigarette was removed and placed in the sample’s container
for each measurement.
