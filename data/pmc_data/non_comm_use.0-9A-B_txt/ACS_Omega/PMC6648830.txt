A new mixed pyridyl–carboxylate
ligand with two picolinate
chromophores and a flexible linear spacer, potassium 2,2′-(butane-1,4-diylbis((pyridin-2-ylmethyl)azanediyl))diacetate
(K2bpbd), which is obtained in high yield and spectroscopically
characterized, has been utilized to make new lanthanide complexes,
namely, [Ln(bpbd) (H2O)2(NO3)]·xH2O, where Ln = Tb (1) and x = 6, Ln = Sm (2) and x =
7, and Ln = Dy (3) and x = 7. These
complexes have been extensively characterized by various spectroscopic
techniques (UV–vis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy),
elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analysis, field emission scanning
electron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. These show very
intense characteristic luminescence features that confirm the antenna
effect of the ligand on the metal center. These complexes have been
utilized for the detection of various nitroaromatic compounds. Among
these three complexes, 1 is found to be the best for
the selective sensing of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol in water with a detection
limit of (0.35 ± 0.05) ppm. Its Stern–Volmer constant, KSV [(5.48 ± 0.1) × 104 M–1], is one of the highest among similar sensors reported
so far.

Introduction
In recent years, lanthanide
complexes have attracted researchers
from various fields for their unique structural features and interesting
magnetic, catalytic, and optical properties.1 Thus, these multifunctional materials have become very important
as magnetic probes, nuclear medicine, optical amplifiers, and sensors,
where modulation of the structures of lanthanide complexes is found
to be the key to their application in such fields.2−5 On the basis of the understanding
in coordination chemistry, the structures of lanthanide complexes
can be controlled by metal ligand interaction, interligand steric
constraints, and so forth. The high ionic character of lanthanides
favors binding with the atoms, which are hard Lewis bases, requiring
a combination of carboxylate and amine as ligands.6 For ligands with low denticity, the final structure remains
difficult to predict in such complexes and often results in coordinated
solvent molecules, which are detrimental to certain properties such
as luminescence (vide infra). On the other hand, the coordination
chemistry of lanthanides with multidentate ligands affords mononuclear,
discrete polynuclear, and coordination polymers.

Utilizing such
information, most recently, the use of polycarboxylates
(two-component systems, where the metal salt is the other component)
or a combination of neutral and anionic nitrogen and oxygen-containing
ligands (three-component systems) has been initiated for the generation
of functional porous frameworks with an expected increased thermal
stability.3−6 However, the lanthanide chemistry (two-component systems) with mixed
ligands, containing both pyridyl and carboxylate groups in the same
ligand, has been explored primarily for establishing their physicochemical
properties with limited applications.6 In
particular, such neutral species are crucial in the development of
new materials with specificity for applications that utilize molecular
recognition.

Lanthanide(III) ions show very unique spectroscopic
properties
because of the shielding of the 4f orbitals by the filled 5s and 5p
subshells with very narrow “finger-like” emission bands
which emerge from f–f transitions. Each lanthanide ion shows
characteristic absorption and emission spectra and can emit in the
entire electromagnetic spectrum from near-UV [Gd(III) and Eu(III)
(red), Tb(III) (green), Sm(III) (orange), Dy(III) (yellow), Tm(III)
(blue)] to near-infrared (NIR) [Yb(III), Nd(III)].7 On the basis of the high energy gap between the lowest
luminescent energy state and the highest nonluminescent energy state,
Sm(III), Eu(III), Tb(III), and Dy(III) ions give strong luminescence
in the visible range.8 Their unique luminescence
properties9 include sharp emission, large
Stoke shift, insensitivity to oxygen, and a long excited lifetime
which ranges from microseconds (for Nd and Yb) to milliseconds (for
Tb and Eu). Their luminescence not only decays because of a radiative
process but can also be quenched through nonradiative decay of the
excited state via coupling of the lanthanide energy level with the
vibrational modes in the surrounding of the lanthanide ion. The most
efficient quenchers are the O–H oscillators (both in solution
and in the solid state). The extent of this quenching is inversely
proportional to the energy gap between the emissive state and the
ground state of the metal.10,11 The other quenchers
of luminescence are the harmonics of N–H, C–H, and C=O
stretching vibrations, but not as O–H oscillators.11 Polydentate ligands not only increase the stability
of the lanthanide complexes in solution but also allow the metal center
to be protected from water molecules. Therefore, the luminescence
of the lanthanide-based complexes is controlled by the denticity of
the ligand. In the presence of linkers with low denticity, the lanthanides
coordinate to solvent molecules, such as water, resulting in the deactivation
of the Ln(III) excited states nonradiatively (vide supra).10

Because of the parity-forbidden intraconfigurational
f–f
transitions by the Laporte selection rule, the Ln(III) ions show these
transitions with a very low molar extinction coefficient (ε
< 10 M–1 cm–1), limiting the
practical applications of the lanthanides. Fortunately, this drawback
of lanthanides can be circumvented by using aromatic chromophores,12 which are directly bound to the Ln(III) center
and absorbed in the UV–vis spectral region. Thus, the absorption
spectra of lanthanide complexes are dominant by the ligand-centered
absorption bands, which are generally very strong and occur in the
UV–vis region. Highly intense luminescence from lanthanides
can be achieved via an “antenna effect”13 where the Ln(III) ions are sensitized by ligands, which
have high triplet energies, through an energy transfer from the triplet
state of the ligand to the excited state of Ln(III) ions. To promote
the energy transfer, the triplet state of the ligand should be higher
than the lowest excited state of the Ln(III) ion. One of the simplest
chromophoric unit is the picolinate moiety, which has been extensively
used for the sensitization of lanthanide emitters.14 Similarly, other ligand moieties have been used for demonstrating
the antenna effect in Ln(III) compounds.15 The aromatic and heteroaromatic carboxylate-based ligands are well-known
to form coordination compounds with lanthanides.6 However, exploitation of such compounds has been limited
for sensing applications.

Sensing based on luminescence is gaining
more attention because
of its simplicity, selectivity, and sensitivity.16,5b,5c The nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) such
as nitrobenzene (NB), dinitrobenzene (DNB), dinitrotoluene (DNT),
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) (also
known as picric acid, PA) are strong oxidizing agents because of the
presence of the electron-withdrawing groups. Out of these, TNT and
TNP, which are highly explosive and dangerous energy sources, have
been frequently used as common ingredients of explosive devices, such
as bombs, grenades, and mine fillings.17,18 TNP is also
used in dyes, fireworks, and leather industries. During its production
and use, it is released into the environment, polluting air, underwater,
soil, and the biosystem, consequently leading to serious health and
environmental issues.19 Therefore, the
detection of NACs has attracted more attention in the last decade
for the concerns of national security, civilian safety, and environmental
protection.20 There are many organic polymers,
coordination polymers, and metal–organic frameworks which are
used for the detection of NACs.15 However,
the lanthanide systems remain far less explored5 compared to the frameworks based on the d-block transition-metal
elements for the reasons mentioned above.

With an understanding
for the choice of ligand and its denticity,
in this work, a new mixed pyridyl–carboxylate ligand with two
picolinate chromophores and a flexible linear spacer, potassium 2,2′-(butane-1,4-diyl
bis((pyridin-2-ylmethyl)azanediyl))-diacetate (K2bpbd),
was synthesized (Scheme 1). The picolinate moiety acts as an antenna, whereas the carboxylate
and the C4 spacer direct the dimensionality and the geometry of the
self-assembled metal complexes. Using this ligand, three new lanthanide
complexes, namely, [Ln(bpbd)(H2O)2(NO3)]·xH2O, where Ln = Tb (1) and x = 6, Ln = Sm (2) and x = 7, and Ln = Dy (3) and x = 7, have been prepared and extensively characterized by various
spectroscopic techniques [UV–vis and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy], elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD). These complexes show very intense characteristic
luminescence features that confirm the antenna effect of the ligand
on the metal center. Their luminescence property was exploited to
do sensing experiments with various NACs. Among these three complexes, 1 is found to be the best for the selective sensing of TNP
in water with a detection limit of (0.35 ± 0.05) ppm.

Scheme 1 Synthetic
Procedure for K2bppd
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The ligand K2bpbd was obtained
in two steps from commercially available 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde,
2-bromoacetic acid, and 1,4-diaminobutane in an overall yield of 60%
(see Scheme 1). In
the first step, the condensation of the aldehyde and diamine in a
ratio of 2:1 resulted in the formation of a Schiff base which was
reduced by sodium borohydride in a single pot to yield the intermediate
bpbn in 98% yield. The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrum confirmed the formation of bpbn (see Figure S1). In the second step, bpbn was reacted with the
potassium salt of bromoacetic acid in water (prepared with 2 equiv
of potassium hydroxide) to synthesize K2bpbd in high purity
(see Figure S2). Its high-resolution mass
spectrometry data are consistent with its formula (see Figure S3). It was further characterized by FTIR
spectroscopy (see Figure S4). For K2bpbd, a peak at 1592 cm–1 corresponds to
the asymmetric stretching frequency of carboxylate, a peak at 1402
cm–1 corresponds to the symmetric stretching of
carboxylate, and a peak at 768 cm–1 corresponds
to the C–H stretching near the nitrogen of pyridine. Compared
to the ethylene-21 or propylene-bridged
derivatives,22 where these were isolated
as the perchlorate salt or the acid itself requiring either extra
steps or further neutralization of the ligand with a base prior to
reacting with metal salts, we prepared it as a potassium salt, K2bpbd. This provides added advantages to isolate it and to
separate the by-product KNO3 (which is much more soluble
in water than the metal complex) in making the metal complexes.

The lanthanide complexes (1–3) were synthesized
by reacting the corresponding lanthanide nitrate salt and the ligand
in a 1:1 ratio in water by the conventional one-pot synthesis at room
temperature. All the complexes obtained are off-white in color. Our
attempts to get suitable single crystals of 1–3 were not successful. This is consistent with the reported fact that
the crystallization of such compounds is difficult.22 Thus, numerous other analytical techniques have been used
to fully characterize them.

Spectroscopic Characterization
The
FTIR spectra of 1–3 were collected at room temperature
in the solid
state using KBr pellets from 4000 to 400 cm–1. These
spectra (Figures S5) are very similar in
nature. To utilize the FTIR data of these metal complexes for their
structural characterization, the binding of the carboxylate groups
in the bpbd ligand and the nitrate anion was analyzed based on the
data listed in Table 1. The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the dicarboxylate
groups in 1–3 are at ∼1584–1594
and ∼1407–1410 cm–1, respectively.
The difference in the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations
(184, 176, and 180 cm–1, respectively, for 1–3) is in the range observed for chelated bidentate
carboxylates but below the typical value (>225 cm–1) for the monodentate binding mode.23 These values are similar to those observed for over 10 lanthanide
compounds with the ethylene21 and propylene22 analogs of bpbd. This suggests that the carboxylate
group is coordinated to the metal center in a bidentate chelated binding
mode. Similarly, a peak at 1384 cm–1 in 1–3 corresponds to the nitrate binding in a monodentate fashion to the
metal center. For a concrete confirmation of the chelated binding
mode of the carboxylate group and the monodentate binding mode of
the nitrate group in 1–3, the FTIR data of few
similar compounds, which are also characterized by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, are considered. For example, in (Me2NH2)3[Eu3(MHFDA)4(NO3)4(DMF)2]·4H2O·2MeCN
(where H2MHFDA = 9-methyl-9-hydroxy-fluorene-2,7-dicarboxylic
acid),5d the values for the symmetric and
asymmetric stretching frequencies of the chelated carboxylate group
were observed at 1589 and 1429 cm–1, respectively,
whereas for the monodentate nitrate group, a peak at 1388 cm–1 was observed.

Carboxylate and Nitrate in 1–3

1	1594	1410	1384	
2	1584	1408	1384	
3	1587	1407	1384	
For the lattice and coordinated water
molecules, the characteristic
broad features at 3423 and ∼3247–3256 cm–1, respectively, are observed because of the O–H stretching
frequency. Our group has been working with such systems containing
mixed carboxylate and pyridyl ligands for a decade and thus has developed
a database to supplement the data compiled in Nakamoto book.23 In one such study,24 we have unequivocally established the stretching frequencies of
the lattice and coordinated water molecules similar to those observed
for 1–3 through variable-temperature FTIR and
single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation.

Thermal Properties
For studying the thermal stability
as a function of temperature, TGA was conducted for the single-phase
polycrystalline samples of 1–3 between 25 and
500 °C under a dinitrogen atmosphere (see Figure 1). From the multistep decomposition process
observed for these compounds, it is clearly evident that they show
similar thermal stability. Using the differential thermal analysis
(DTA) curves (see Figure S6), three steps
in their decomposition process are established. In the first step,
six lattice water molecules are lost below 100 °C with a good
agreement between the calculated and found values (14.4% calcd, 12.8%
found for 1; 16.6% calcd, 16.8% found for 2; and 16.7% calcd, 16.5% found for 3). With this initial
loss of lattice water molecules, these compounds are stable up to
220 °C. The second step corresponds to the loss of coordinated
water molecules and the release of nitrate ion (15.3% calcd, 17.3%
found for 1; 14.5% calcd, 14.46% found for 2; and 15.6% calcd, 13.5% found for 3). In the final
step, up to 500 °C, it is found that a partial decomposition
of the bpbd ligand (carboxylate and pyridyl groups) has occurred (34.99%
calcd, 33.22% found for 1; 35.5% calcd, 35.6% calcd for 2; and 38.02% calcd, 36.7% found for 3).

Crystallinity and Morphology
The PXRD patterns were
recorded for 1–3 at room temperature, as shown
in Figure 2. On the
basis of these patterns, 1, 2, and 3 are found to be isostructural. It also confirms the phase
purity and crystallinity of bulk samples of 1–3.

Figure 2 PXRD patterns of 1–3.

To comprehend the surface morphology of 1–3, FESEM was performed (see Figure 3). The samples 1, 2, and 3 show polyhedral, flake, and globular type of morphology,
respectively.

and 3 (bottom).

Proposed Structure
As mentioned earlier, our efforts
to elucidate the structures of 1–3 by single-crystal
XRD were not successful. However, their intensive characterization
described in the above sections provides important observations to
propose their structures, as shown in Figure 4 for 1 as an example. First
of all, their PXRD data suggested the isostructural nature of 1–3. Furthermore, their TGA patterns are very similar
in nature, whereas the absorbance in 1–3 is ligand-centered.
Second, based on the analysis of FTIR data, the binding modes of the
carboxylate groups in the bpbd ligand and the nitrate anion are found
to be bidentate (chelated) and monodentate, respectively. Utilizing
such detailed and conclusive information, a polymeric chain structure
can be proposed. In this structure, the coordination number of the
metal center is 11, which is not unusual but observed in many lanthanide
complexes. Considering a few crystal structures of lanthanides with
similar ligands where the carboxylate groups are attached to the pyridyl
groups instead of the alkyl nitrogen (compared to bpbd)6a as well as other polycarboxylate ligands,5d,5e this structure is reasonable. This provides an understanding for
the interaction of NACs with 1–3 (vide infra),
and thus their application as luminescent probes for the detection
of NACs can be studied utilizing the antenna effect of the ligand.
Furthermore, the stability of these complexes in water is confirmed
by the observation of the antenna effect of the ligand (see “Photophysical Properties” section).

of 1.

Photophysical Properties
The emission spectra of 1–3 recorded at room
temperature with 1 mg in 2 mL
Milli-Q water are displayed in Figures 5–7. As a reference, the emission spectrum of the K2bpbd
ligand is shown in Figure S7. The characteristic
luminescent behavior of 1–3 suggests that the
intramolecular energy transfer from the ligand to Ln(III) is observed,
with no ligand-centered broad emission. In case of Tb(III), intramolecular
energy transfer is much more effective than those for Dy(III) and
Sm(III) complexes. Comparing the emission spectra of 1 and Tb(NO3)3·6H2O in Figure 5, it is clear that
the ligand has sensitized the Tb(III) center and thus demonstrates
the antenna effect in the lanthanide complexes.

Figure 5 Emission spectrum of 1 (excited at 340 nm). For showing
the antenna effect in 1 by the ligand, the emission spectrum
of Tb(NO3)3·6H2O recorded under
the same conditions is also shown.

nm, bottom)
of 3 (excited at 270 nm).

[Tb(bpbd)(H2O)2(NO3)]·6H2O (1)
The solid-state reflectance spectra
of K2bpbd and 1 (Figure S8) were recorded to determine the excitation wavelength for 1 at 340 nm. This is in the range of the excitation wavelength
(325–340 nm) used for other Tb compounds in the literature.5b,5c Upon excitation at 340 nm, the emission spectrum was collected in
the range 470–650 nm at room temperature. It displays characteristic
emission bands at 489, 545, 586, and 621 nm and the typical emission
spectrum dominated by the hypersensitive 5D4 → 7F5 transition.6a The emission band at 545 nm is the most intense, which
corresponds to green luminescence, as shown in Figure 5.

[Sm(bpbd)(H2O)2(NO3)]·7H2O (2)
The emission
spectrum of 2 recorded from 555 to 750 nm at room temperature
(excitation
wavelength: 260 nm) is shown in Figure 6. It consists of four characteristic optic bands centered
at 564, 604, 648, and 707 nm, which are attributed to the f–f
transitions of 4G5/2 (emitting level) → 6HJ/2 (J = 5,
7, 9, and 11).25 The emission band at 604
nm is the most intense, which corresponds to orange luminescence.
However, its intensity is one order of magnitude less than that observed
for the most intense peak for 1.

[Dy(bpbd)(H2O)2(NO3)]·7H2O (3)
The emission spectrum of 3 was recorded at
room temperature. The excitation at 270
nm resulted in second-order interference, and thus to avoid this the
emission spectrum was recorded in two segments. As shown in Figure 7, the observed metal-centered
emission bands at 484 and 576 nm, which correspond to yellow luminescence,
result from the 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 and 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 transitions, respectively, whereas a very weak signal
at 664 nm is attributed to the 4F9/2 → 6H11/2 transition.25 However,
the intensity of bands at 484 and 576 nm is 4 times less than that
observed for the most intense peak for 1.

Sensing of
NACs
On the basis of the photophysical properties
of 1–3, luminescence sensing was carried out with
various NACs (TNP, TNT, 2,4-DNP, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, 1,3-DNB, 4-NP,
2-NP, and NB) in water. The quenching efficiency (%) of different
NACs by 1, calculated using the equation (I0 – I)/I0 × 100%, is plotted in Figure 8. The luminescence intensity at 545 nm is
monitored which decreases with a gradual addition of 10 μL of
NAC (2 mM in water) for a total of 120 μL. It is observed that
other NACs exhibit negligible to moderate quenching effect in comparison
to TNP, thereby showing better selectivity for TNP. The quenching
efficiency of 1 for the NACs in water shows the following
order: TNP ≫ 2,4-DNP > 4-NP > 2-NP > NB > 1,3-DNB
> 2,6-DNT
> TNT ≫ 2,4-DNT. The decrease in quenching efficiency with
the reduction in the acidity of phenolic NACs can also be ascribed
to the presence of Lewis basic moieties like oxygen of the nitrate
anion, where these oxygen atoms can form H-bonding interactions with
the phenolic protons of the nitrophenol derivatives, which are absent
in the other NAC analytes. Focusing on TNP, an incremental addition
of TNP to 1 produced an inconceivable and significant
luminescence quenching of (92 ± 0.16)% (Figure 9).

Figure 8 Luminescence quenching % of different NACs for 1.

Figure 9 Effect on the emission spectrum of 1 upon incremental
addition of TNP (numbers shown in μL). Inset: quenching % for
three runs showing reproducibility of the data.

The three-dimensional (3D) Stern–Volmer (S–V)
plot
of all analytes for 1 is shown in Figure 10. In Figure S9, all nitrophenols are compared. The S–V plot of TNP for 1 shows linearity at lower concentrations and deviates from
linearity at higher concentrations (Figure S10). This was further elaborated by using the S–V equation  where I0 and I are the luminescence intensities of the probes, before
and after the addition of NACs, KSV is
the S–V constant (M–1), and [A] is the molar
concentration of the analyte. Using the linear region of the S–V
plot, a KSV value of (5.48 ± 0.1)
× 104 M–1 is obtained for 1 (Figure S11). Thus, the limit
of detection of TNP is found to be as low as (0.35 ± 0.05) ppm
based on the value of 3σ/m (Figure S12). These results vividly depict that 1 has a high selectivity
for TNP over other potentially interfering NACs. The KSV value of 1 is one of the highest among
similar sensors.5,15,26 Only two Tb(III) compounds containing di- and tricarboxylates have
been reported for TNP sensing prior to this study. The KSV values for these compounds are 7.47 × 104 M–1 ({[Tb(L)1.5(H2O)]·3H2O}n, H2L = 2-(2-hydroxy-propionyl
amino)terephthalic acid)5c and 3.42 ×
104 M–1 ([Tb(1,3,5-BTC)]n, 1,3,5-BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate).5b Similarly, the KSV value for {La(TPT)(dimethyl sulfoxide)2]·(H2O)}n (H3TPT = p-terphenyl-3,4″,5-tricarboxylic acid)5g is 9.89 × 104 M–1. Further comparison with any organic or metal–organic probes
(KSV values), such as fluorescein-based
F1 (3.94 × 104 M–1), {Cd3(TPT)2(DMF)2]·0.5(H2O)}n (6.56 × 104 M–1), [Cd(NDC)0.5(PCA)] (3.5 × 104 M–1), and UiO-67-dcppy (2.9 × 104 M–1), indicates that the selective sensing of TNP by 1 is outstanding.26 Out of the
last three probes, the detection limit (0.13 ppm) was reported only
for F1.

Figure 10 3D S–V plot of various analytes in water for 1.

For further elaboration, the strong
supramolecular interactions
between TNP and 1 can be considered. The acidic hydrogen from TNP can bind with the oxygen of the nitrate
anion through hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, the electron
transfer from the electron-rich picolinate moiety of 1 to electron-deficient TNP is possible through π–π
interactions (see Scheme S1). In case of
other analytes, electrostatic interaction is the chief and sole principle
leading to the quenching of 1, and thus the quenching
constants are much lower compared to the hydroxy-containing counterparts.
Moreover, there is no deviation from linearity in their S–V
plots (Figure S9). Therefore, the luminescence
quenching of 1 by TNP can be described as a result of
the competitive processes of energy absorption by TNP and the electronic
interactions between TNP and the ligands coordinated to the Tb(III)
center. On the basis of the absorption spectra of the NACs (Figure S13) and the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy
diagrams of the NACs (Figure S14), upon
excitation of 1 at 340 nm, TNP absorbs a lot more of
excitation energy than the other nonphenolic analytes, leaving less
energy source for the bpbd ligand. This reduces the probability of
energy transfer from the ligand to the metal center which is the source
of the antenna effect on the luminescence intensity of the Tb(III)
center in 1. In addition to the primary competitive processes
mentioned above, inner filter effect (IFE) can also exist to some
extent and contribute to the quenching process with a varying effect.
In the past, the correction factor for IFE is described for solution
systems.27 The IFE has also been utilized
as one of the sensing tools where the absorbance changes of the absorber
translate exponentially into luminescence intensity changes but with
less selectivity.28 However, the IFE has
to be a minor component for the selective sensing of TNP by 1 because of the fact that its concentration used in this
study is very low (1 mg in 2 mL water). Interestingly, its concentration
is the lowest among all similar probes5b,5c (e.g., 10
mg in 1.5 mL water), but this variation does not result in much different KSV values and detection limits (vide supra).
This effect is further reduced as the instrument used in this study
has horizontal slits. For a control experiment to evaluate the contribution
of the IFE, a species has to be chosen which will have the same absorption
at the excitation wavelength for TNP but will not interact with 1. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find a nonaromatic species,
which will not interact with the electron-rich picolinate moiety of
the ligand attached to the Tb center in 1 and yet absorb
at the desired wavelength. Furthermore, for solid probes dispersed
in a solvent (for recyclability purpose), it is not so practical to
do measurements for the quantification of the minor contribution of
IFE. Thus, no attempt was made for any IFE correction in this case.

The quenching efficiency (%) of different NACs by 2 is plotted in Figure S15a. The luminescence intensity at 604 nm is monitored,
which decreases with a gradual addition of 10 μL of NAC for
a total of 120 μL. Unlike 1, all NACs exhibit moderate
but similar quenching effect for 2. The 3D S–V
plot of all analytes for 2 is shown in Figure S16. The S–V plot of TNP for 2 shows
linearity at a lower concentration (Figure S17), providing a KSV value of (6.96 ±
0.1) × 103 M–1. An incremental addition
of TNP to 2 (Figure S15b)
provides a limit of detection of 14 ppm based on the value of 3σ/m
(Figure S18).

(%) of different NACs by 3 is plotted in Figure S19a. The luminescence
intensity at 484 nm is monitored, which decreases with a gradual addition
of 10 μL of NACs for a total of 120 μL. Unlike 1, all NACs exhibit a moderate but similar quenching effect for 3. In case of 3, the 3D plot of all analytes
is shown in Figure S20. The S–V
plot of TNP for 3 shows linearity at a lower concentration
(Figure S21), providing a KSV value of (1.05 ± 0.01) × 104 M–1. An incremental addition of TNP to 3 (Figure S19b) provides a limit of detection
of 0.9 ppm based on the value of 3σ/m (Figure S22).

Conclusions
Using a new pyridine–carboxylate
ligand, complexes of Tb(III),
Sm(III), and Dy(III) have been synthesized in good yields. Their purity,
physicochemical, and luminescent properties were established by various
analytical techniques. The FTIR spectroscopy data conclusively confirmed
the chelating bidentate binding mode of the carboxylate and the monodentate
binding mode of the nitrate. These complexes were found to be stable
in the solid state up to 220 °C. On the basis of the PXRD and
TGA data, compounds 1, 2, and 3 were found to be isomorphous. All these complexes showed their characteristic
visible and NIR luminescence through intramolecular energy transfer
from the ligand to the lanthanide center because of the antenna effect.
The Tb(III) complex (1) showed selective sensing of TNP
over other NACs with the best detection limit of (0.35 ± 0.05)
ppm. This work encourages us to put further efforts to improve the
sensitivity and efficacy of the sensors, and thus numerous derivatives
are designed for future studies. Furthermore, sensing of other neutral
molecules, anions, and cations is being carried out with such compounds.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
The compounds 2-Pyridinecarboxaldehyde,
2-bromoacetic acid, 1,4-diaminobutane, samarium nitrate, dysprosium
nitrate, and terbium nitrate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anhydrous
sodium sulfate was obtained from Merck. The solvents used were of
reagent grade and without purification. D2O was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich and CDCl3 was obtained from Merck. Each
FTIR spectrum was recorded with 16 scans (resolution: 4 cm–1) on a PerkinElmer spectrum RX I FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets
in the range from 4000 to 400 cm–1. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz using a Bruker ARX 400 spectrometer,
with tetramethylsilane (Si(CH3)4) as an internal
standard. SpinWork software was used to analyze the data. TGA–DTA
data collection was carried out in a Shimadzu DTG-60H analyzer with
a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a flow atmosphere of nitrogen
from 25 to 500 °C by using an aluminum pan. UV–vis absorption
spectra were obtained on a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
in the range 200–800 nm. C, H, and N analyses were performed
on a Leco TruSpec Micro CHNS analyzer; the typical mass of a sample
was 2 mg. PXRD patterns were collected in the 2θ = 3–50°
range with a scanning speed of 5° per min with a 0.02° interval
on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer using BB geometry, a sample rotation
(120 rpm) attachment, and a Dtex Ultra detector. The luminescence
spectra for the solid samples were recorded by a HORIBA Fluorolog-3
(FL3-21) spectrofluorometer. FESEM was performed on a JEOL JSM-7600F
instrument; the samples were well-dispersed in MeOH, drop-casted on
a silicon wafer, dried, and coated with gold using a working distance
of 4.5–15 mm and voltage 10–15 kV.

Caution! Bromoacetic acid is a very reactive, toxic, and strong alkylating
agent that should be handled wearing nitrile gloves in a chemical
hood.

Synthesis of K2bpbd
Step I: To a solution
of 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (3.8 mL, 40 mmol) in 5 mL of methanol,
1,4-diaminobutane (2 mL, 20 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 °C
with continuous stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h
at room temperature followed by the addition of a slight excess of
sodium borohydride at 0 °C. After stirring for another 12 h,
the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a brown
residue. The residue was extracted with dichloromethane and washed
with water (3 × 2 mL), followed by drying the organic phase with
anhydrous sodium sulfate. The evaporation of the dichloromethane layer
under reduced pressure afforded a yellow oily product (bpbn). Yield:
4.4 g (98%). 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ: 8.53 (d,
2H), 7.62 (t, 2H), 7.30 (m, 2H), 7.13 (d, 2H), 3.97 (s, 4H), 2.66
(s, 4H), 2.59 (t, 2H), 1.59 (t, 4H).

Step II: To a clear solution
of bromoacetic acid (830 mg, 6 mmol) in 5 mL water, a solution of
potassium hydroxide (349 mg, 6 mmol) in 5 mL water was added in a
dropwise fashion over a period of 15 min with constant stirring which
was continued for further 30 min. This resultant solution was added
dropwise to a solution of bpbn [830 mg (3 mmol) in 5 mL of water kept
at 0 °C for 30 min] with vigorous stirring. After half an hour,
a solution of KOH [354 mg, (6 mmol) in 5 mL of water] was added to
the above reaction mixture at 0 °C, and the resulting reaction
mixture was further stirred for 96 h. Upon removal of the solvent
under reduced pressure, a solid was obtained. To the crude product,
dry methanol was added to separate out the by-product potassium bromide
via filtration; the filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced
pressure, and the solid was redissolved in 5 mL of dry methanol and
filtered to remove potassium bromide; this step was repeated one more
time. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure, yielding
a semisolid to which 5 mL of acetonitrile was added and left undisturbed
for 12 h. The desired product, an off-white solid, was isolated by
decanting the solvent and vacuum-dried. Yield: 800 mg (60%). MS (ESI-TOF): m/z calcd for [(C20H24N4O4K2) + 1]+, 463.11;

In a 10 mL round-bottom
flask, Tb(NO3)3·6H2O (20 mg,
0.046 mmol) was added to a 2 mL aqueous solution of K2bpbd
(21 mg, 0.046 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 day at
ambient conditions. A white solid product was obtained via filtration,
which was washed with cold water and air-dried. Yield: 24 mg (69%).
