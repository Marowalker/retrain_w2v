Commercial producers
of containerized ornamental plants almost
exclusively use soilless media as the substrate for growing the plants.
Soilless media are composed primarily of organic materials as opposed
to mineral soils. Significant amounts of pesticides can leach from
pots containing soilless media to which pesticides have been added
as drenches or top-dressings. One of the goals of this project was
to identify whether individual components comprising soilless media
have differing affinities for the pesticides acephate, imidacloprid,
metalaxyl, and plant growth regulator paclobutrazol. One-point 24
h equilibrium sorption assays were conducted to characterize sorption
of the pesticides to sand, perlite, vermiculite, coir, peat, pine
bark, and aluminum-water treatment residuals (Al-WTRs). Five-point
isotherms were then constructed for the more sorptive peat and pine
bark substrate components, and for the Al-WTRs. Results indicated
significant differences in pesticide behavior with each substrate.
Sorption of acephate to most of the substrate components was relatively
low, comprising 21–31% of the initial amounts for soilless
media components and 63% in Al-WTRs. Al-WTRs were highly sorptive
for imidacloprid as evidenced by a partition coefficient of KF = 3275.4 L kg–1. Pine bark
was the most sorptive for metalaxyl-M with a measured KF = 195.0 L kg–1. Peat had the highest
affinity for paclobutrazol (KF = 398.4
L kg–1). These results indicate that none of component
of soilless media has a universally high attraction for all of the
pesticides studied.

==== Body
Introduction
Soilless media are used throughout the
ornamental plant production
industry for growing containerized ornamental plants. Soilless media
composition differs widely between growers and sources. This is partly
due to the needs of specific ornamental crop species such as providing
a good balance of root aeration and water retention,1 wettability,2 and low transport
costs.3 Typical components of soilless
media include a variety of organic materials,4,5 as
well as inorganic and synthetic substrates.6 Common inorganic components include sand and processed materials
such as perlite and vermiculite. Inorganic materials typically make
up a small percentage of the overall volume of media used in the industry.
The organic components, which make up the majority of the media, include
peat, coir, pine bark, rice hulls, and many other plant-based materials
depending on the region or climate.5−7 While field production
of containerized ornamental plants relies almost entirely on soilless
media, it should also be noted that the greenhouse production of vegetables,
fruit, and ornamentals, as well as urban horticulture systems, also
rely on soilless media because of its advantages of avoiding soil-borne
pathogens, allowing production in areas where native soils are not
suitable, and allowing better control of chemical, physical, and hydraulic
characteristics relative to soil-based systems.7 Demand for high-quality food crops, cut flowers, potted
plants, and bedding plants grown using soilless media will continue
to increase as the global standard-of-living increases.7

Plant production practices can contribute
to the contamination
of surface water with pesticides,8−13 but few studies have investigated factors contributing to losses
of pesticides from ornamental plant production areas.14,15 Hinz and colleagues (2019)52 recently
reported that significant losses of pesticides may occur from ornamental
plants to which the pesticides were applied to the soilless media
as liquid formulation drenches or as surface-applied granular formulations.
Pesticide leaching from containerized plants is analogous to contaminant
transport in the vadose zone, with the soilless media mimicking the
porous system of soils.7,16

Sorption or retention of
pesticides to media components depends
on both pesticide and material properties such as, chemical structure,
organic carbon content, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and ion-exchange
capacity.17,18 Information on possible sorptive interactions
between pesticides and individual components of the soilless media
could lead to the development of formulations with greater potential
for holding the pesticides in the pot and preventing contamination
of surface and ground water. However, only a few studies have investigated
sorption of a limited number of pesticides to some of these materials.
de Wilde and colleagues19,20 proposed using some
components of soilless media in on-farm biopurification systems to
remove pesticides from contaminated water. They evaluated sorption
of lenacil, isoproturon, metalaxyl, isoxaben, and linuron on different
components, and found that peat, coconut chips, and straw had higher
sorption coefficients for the pesticides relative to sand, chopped
willow, and dried cow manure. Other studies found that amending calcisols
and regosols with composted pine bark, coir, and coffee grounds reduced
the leaching potential of phenylurea herbicides.21 Pine bark and coir have also been reported to sorb-persistent
organics such as organochlorine insecticides22,23 and triazine herbicides.24

Another
potentially useful material for reducing leaching of pesticides
from ornamental plant containers is water treatment residuals (WTRs).
WTRs are byproducts of drinking water treatment plants.25,26 Efforts have focused on finding uses for these materials, which
are otherwise disposed of in landfills or by other means. WTRs are
mostly composed of fine soil particles, organic materials, and Fe
and Al hydroxides depending on the salt used as the coagulant during
the water purification process.27 These
materials develop surface charges as a result of uncoordinated hydroxyl
groups, which lead to surface reactivity.28 Al-WTRs have been proposed as sorbents for some inorganic constituents
such as soluble forms of arsenic in soils29 and for field-reactive barriers for soluble phosphorous removal.30,31 Al-WTRs have also shown potential for immobilizing some emerging
contaminants such as veterinary antibiotics (tetracyclines) in manure-amended
soils.32 The sorption potential of Al-WTRs
for pesticides and other organic contaminants has otherwise received
little attention.

This study characterized the sorption/retention
of a suite of selected
pesticides on mineral (sand, perlite, vermiculite) and organic (coir,
peat, and pine bark) components of typical soilless media formulations
used by the containerized plant production industry. The potential
for use of Al-WTRs as an amendment to sorb the pesticides was also
evaluated. Study hypotheses were that organic soilless media components
and Al-WTRs have a higher sorption capacity for the pesticides used
in this study relative to the inorganic/mineral components.

Results
and Discussion
Solvent Selection
A summary of the
pH and EC values
for each extractant–media–component combination (including
Al-WTRs) is shown in Table 1. Relative to ornamental plant production guidelines, the
10 mM CaCl2 extractant did not produce a realistic matrix
in terms of the proper conditions for ornamental plant root zone development
because of the low pH (except perlite pH = 6.42 ± 0.05) and very
high salinity values (EC ranging from 3.05 to 4.28 dS m–1). Conversely, the potassium-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) was an acceptable
extractant for most components in terms of providing salinities within
recommended values for ornamental plant production. In addition, the
matrix produced by this buffered extractant also showed nearly enough
capacity (without liming) to buffer against acidity associated with
the peat, pine bark, and Al-WTRs relative to CaCl2 and
water. The acidity of these materials is related to the buffering
capacity (ionization of functional groups) in organic materials42 and the presence of uncoordinated hydroxy groups
in Al-WTRs,27 which also have a large buffering
capacity.43

One-Point
Sorption Equilibria
One-point sorption isotherm
studies were conducted to provide an initial approximation of the
interaction between all compounds of interest and each substrate component
or the Al-WTRs. The data are summarized as means ± one standard
deviation in Figure 1. Sorption of the pesticides was variable (Figure 1), but all exhibited some sorption that was
greater than what would be expected by chance (ANOVA P values < 0.001). The largest amount of acephate (63.3%) sorbed
to the Al-WTRs, while sorption to sand was the least (6.5%) (Figure 1). Sorption to perlite,
vermiculite, coir, peat, and pine bark was intermediate, ranging from
21.0 to 31.0%. In comparison, sand and perlite had little affinity
for imidacloprid, sorbing only 9.3 and 10.2%, respectively, while
43.0% of the initial amount adsorbed to the inorganic component vermiculite
(Figure 1). Coir, peat,
pine bark, and Al-WTRs had the highest affinities for imidacloprid,
accounting for the sorption of 76.2, 91.2, 87.1, and 82.6% of the
initial mass added to the solution, respectively. More than 35% of
the initial mass of metalaxyl-M sorbed to all the materials evaluated
(Figure 1). In this
case, 60.3% of the initial mass sorbed to sand, which was the highest
amount of sorption of any of the compounds to sand. The least amounts
of metalaxyl-M sorbed to the perlite (35.0%) and Al-WTRs (41.0%),
while sorption to pine bark was the greatest (79.2%). Sorption to
vermiculite, coir, and peat ranged from 58.8 to 69.8%. No paclobutrazol
sorption occurred on the sand or perlite (Figure 1). Paclobutrazol sorption was highest with
the peat (92.9%), pine bark (88.9%), and Al-WTRs (84.5%), while sorption
to vermiculite (60.3%) and coir (70.4%) was intermediate.

Multipoint Batch Equilibria Isotherms: Pine Bark, Peat and Al-WTRs
Based on results from the 1-point isotherms, peat, pine bark, and
Al-WTRs were selected for further investigations into the sorptive
behavior of the four chemicals. These studies evaluated sorption at
5 initial concentrations (Table 2). Isotherms for each pesticide
and sorbate are shown in Figures 2–5, and a summary of fitted model parameters is shown
in Table 3. The appropriateness
of the regression was assessed based upon the model R2. In general, better linear regressions and model goodness-of-fit
are related to higher R2 values.40,41 Most sorption isotherms were “L-type”37 and followed the Freundlich model which suggests progressive
saturation of the sorbate surfaces with subsequent decreases in sorption
as the concentration in solution increases. However, there were several
exceptions to this general trend, including sorption of acephate to
Al-WTRs, imidacloprid to pine bark, and Al-WTRs, and paclobutrazol
to peat.

a The solutions were equilibrated
in a background of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5).

b KF:
Freundlich model nonlinear partition coefficient (Se = KF × CeN) where Se is
the sorbed concentration (mg kg–1) and Ce is the
solution concentration (mg L–1). N is the model exponent.

c The best fit model was a Langmuir
isotherm, where Se = (Smax × Ce)/(KL + Ce). KL is the
affinity coefficient that corresponds with the apparent sorption coefficient
in the lower concentrations (14.6 ± 3.7 L kg–1), and Smax is the Al-WTRs maximum sorption
capacity, in this case 1004.2 ± 88.0 mg kg–1.

d The isotherm was linear
(i.e., the
exponent N = 1).

Sorption of acephate to Al-WTRs was best described
by a Langmuir
isotherm indicating that the reactive surfaces of the material would
have a finite sorption maxima (Smax) of
1004.2 mg kg–1 and an apparent sorption coefficient
of 14.6 L kg–1 (Figure 2). Pine bark had the highest affinity (i.e.,
largest sorption coefficient) for acephate (KF = 89.0 L kg–1, N = 0.83),
followed by Al-WTRs (KF = 14.6 L kg–1), and peat (KF = 3.73
kg–1, N = 1.31).

While sorption
of imidacloprid to peat was best described by the
Freundlich model, sorption to the pine bark and Al-WTRs was best described
by linear partitioning models, indicating no saturation of active
sorption sites throughout the concentration ranges evaluated (Figure 3). Imidacloprid sorption
coefficients for the Al-WTRs were an order of magnitude higher (KF = 3275.4 L kg–1, N = 1) than for peat (KF = 290.4
L kg–1, N = 0.77) and pine bark
(KF = 157.4 L kg–1, N = 1). In this case, over 99% of the applied mass sorbed
to the Al-WTRs regardless of the initial concentration.

Sorption
of metalaxyl-M to all three substrates was best described
using Freundlich models (Figure 4). Metalaxyl-M had the highest affinity for pine bark
(KF = 195.0 L kg–1, N = 1.44), followed by peat (54.9 L kg–1, N = 1.20), and Al-WTRs (3.4 L kg–1, N = 2.1).

Sorption of paclobutrazol to pine
bark and Al-WTRs was best described
with Freundlich models, having sorption coefficients of 88.4 L kg–1 (N = 0.89) and 88.0 L kg–1 (N = 0.78), respectively (Figure 5). Sorption of paclobutrazol to peat was
greater in this media and was described with a linear model, which
produced a sorption coefficient of 398.4 L kg–1 (N = 1).

Sorption of pesticides to soils, sediments,
and other solid surfaces
such as soilless media components is a complex, nonlinear phenomenon
that depends on many factors related to the specific pesticide and
reactive surfaces on/in sorbent.44,45 These properties
include the solid-solution ratio, pH, EC, redox potential, presence
of and types of functional groups, pKa, sorbent colloidal fraction content (such as clay type and content),
and organic matter content and composition. While determination of
specific mechanisms for sorption was beyond the scope of this study,
some speculation can be made which could direct future mechanistic
studies. Of all the chemical–sorbent combinations, the sorption
coefficient of imidacloprid to Al-WTRs (3275.4 L kg–1) was 1–3 orders of magnitude greater than any of the others.
This high degree of sorption may be through interaction of the nitro-amino
group with positively charged moieties within the Al-WTRs because
nitro groups carry a net negative charge. The Al-WTRs should have
regions with net positive charges at the pH values used to conduct
these studies.28 Sorption was best described
using a linear model. Because saturation did not occur within the
range of concentrations evaluated, this linear model may fit within
a Langmuir (assumes a 1:1 interaction between surface active moieties
and sorbates) or Freundlich model (exponent N = 1;
assumes more interactions than Langmuir). Experiments using higher
concentrations of the pesticide are needed to determine which of these
two models best describe sorptive interactions. The lower affinity
of the other chemicals for WTRs was likely due to the lack of these
strongly negatively charged functional groups. Sorption of acephate
to WTRs was best described by a Langmuir model and displayed saturation
kinetics (Figure 2)
illustrating a finite number of sorptive sites. We speculate that
sorption occurred between the positively charged sorbent active sites
on the Al-WTRs and the polar carbonyl and phosphoryl functional groups.
Sorption of metalaxyl-m and paclobutrazol to Al-WTRs was best described
using Freundlich models, which allow for interactions between sorbent
and sorbate through multiple mechanisms. Sorption in this case may
have been due to a combination of hydrophobic nonpolar interactions
as well as polar interactions with the −Cl and hydroxyl group
in paclobutrazol and the carbonyl groups in metalaxyl-M. Both of these
chemicals are more hydrophobic than acephate and imidacloprid (Table 2). Paclobutrazol sorption
to Al-WTRs was the second greatest having a KF of 88.0 L kg–1 as compared to KF values of 14.6 and 3.36 for acephate and metalaxyl,
respectively. In this case, paclobutrazol’s Kow is 6–26 times higher than the others.

The organic materials peat and pine bark are both derived from
plant sources but differ in the degree of weathering with peat forming
over thousands of years versus pine bark sources that are weathered
for a few months to a few years. The specific chemical and physical
properties of the pine bark substrates depend on the tree species,
harvesting methods and season, and how and when the materials are
processed.46 Pine bark is derived from
phloem, which consists of lignin, cellulose, polysaccharides, and
a variety of other components. Lignin is a biopolymer of oxidatively
coupled alcohols including: hydroxy-cinnamyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol,
sinapyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol.47 Likewise, cellulose is a complex biopolymer
composed of β-d-glucopyranose units linked together
through glycosidic bonds.48 Both of these
complex molecules have abundant hydroxyl and methoxy functional groups
that can participate in sorptive processes. Imidacloprid was the only
chemical for which sorption to pine bark was best characterized using
a linear model (Figure 3). As discussed earlier, this linear model may describe Freundlich
or Langmuir sorptive interactions at higher concentrations than tested.
As with the Al-WTRs, imidacloprid sorption to pine bark likely occurred
through specific interactions; in this case, interactions between
the polar hydroxyl and methoxy functional groups in the cellulose/lignins
and the polar nitro group on imidacloprid. Interestingly, saturation
of the active sites was not observed indicating an abundance of sorptive
sites. Sorption of acephate, metalaxyl-m, and paclobutrazol was characterized
by Freundlich models. Sorption of these compounds also did not reach
saturation and was likely due to a combination of polar and hydrophobic
interactions between the materials.

As mentioned earlier, peat
is derived from highly weathered plant
materials, including lignin and cellulose. Important functional groups
associated with weathered soil organic matter include carboxyl, phenolic-OH,
carbonyl, sulfonic, sulfhydryl, amine, imide, and nitrogen heterocycles.28 Peat is one of the most widely used soilless
media substrate components in the ornamental plant production industry.5 Peat has been proposed as a sorbent for organic
contaminants49 with potential use for biopurification
systems.20 Paclobutrazol and imidacloprid
had the highest affinities (KF values
of 398 and 290 L kg–1, respectively) for peat relative
to acephate and metalaxyl (KF values of
3.7 and 54.9 L kg–1, respectively). In this study,
acephate, imidacloprid, and metalaxyl-m sorption was best characterized
with Freundlich models, indicating nonspecific sorption processes.
As with pine park, sorption of these compounds was likely due to a
variety of processes including polar interactions and hydrophobic
interactions. Imidacloprid sorption may be facilitated through polar
interactions of the chlorine as well as the nitro groups with sulfhydryl,
amine, imide, and heterocyclic N functional groups in the organic
material. Sorption of metalaxyl-M to peat (KF of 54.9 ± 9.4 L kg–1) observed in
this study is similar to that reported by de Wilde and collaborators
(KF = 58.8 L kg–1).20 In contrast, paclobutrazol sorption was best
described using a linear model. In this case, saturation of sorption
sites was not observed at the concentrations tested. As discussed
earlier, this may be representative of the linear portion of Langmuir
or Freundlich isotherms. Of the three materials, paclobutrazol sorption
to peat was the greatest (Figure 5). The increased sorption relative to pine bark likely
reflects the increased diversity and abundance of functional groups
because of greater weathering. Paclobutrazol has an active hydroxyl
group and an electron-withdrawing chlorine that may facilitate interactions
of the molecule with polar or charged functional groups.

Interestingly,
retention of the two most sorbed chemicals to peat
(paclobutrazol and imidacloprid) was much less in pine bark, indicating
significant differences in the physical and chemical properties of
the materials. The physical and chemical properties of pine bark media
components are known to change with aging,50 though they have not been thoroughly characterized. One important
feature to consider is the particle size of the material. Pine bark
used in these studies was homogenized with an average particle size
of 9.5 mm (3/8 in.). Coarser pine bark particles such as found in
actual production containers, might have a lower retention capacity
for any of these chemicals because of the reduction in reactive surface
area.

One of the original motivations for this project was to
identify
whether soilless media recipes could be developed to optimize retention
of pesticides in the container and minimize leaching. As seen in this
study, sorption to soilless media components can be highly variable
depending on the chemical and substrate component. As a result, at
present, a targeted chemical-specific approach would be required to
minimize leaching of pesticides from ornamental plant production containers.
Further research is needed to determine whether other chemicals behave
similarly, as well as testing the adequacy of Al-WTRs and other materials
(e.g., different biochars) as amendments for soilless growing media
formulations.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
Four active ingredients were
selected for the study, including the insecticides acephate and imidacloprid,
the fungicide metalaxyl-M, and the plant growth regulator paclobutrazol.
These pesticides were chosen based on their use in ornamental plant
production and their contrasting chemical–physical properties.
A summary of the chemical and physical characteristics of these pesticides
is shown in Table 2. Analytical standards were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich PESTANAL
(St. Louis, Missouri, USA) with >98.5% purity. Aqueous solutions
of
pesticides were prepared in reagent-grade water produced by a Nanopure
Infinity UV System (Barnstead-Thermolyne; Dubuque, Iowa USA). Optima
grade methanol, water, and formic acid for liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry analysis were purchased from Fisher Chemical (New Hampshire,
USA). Ammonium formate (NH4HCO2), calcium chloride
(CaCl2), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), potassium
dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), potassium hydrogen
phosphate (K2HPO4), and KCl were obtained from
Fisher Chemical (>95% purity for all). Sodium azide (NaN3, 98% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as a microbial
biocide in aqueous solutions used for the sorption experiments.

Media and Al-WTRs
Samples of the most commonly used
components of soilless media were donated by SUNGRO (Orlando, Florida,
USA). Mineral media components included sand, perlite, and vermiculite;
while organic components included peat, coir, and pine bark. All media
components were thoroughly mixed before taking subsamples for characterization
and cold storage. Al-WTRs were provided by a water treatment plant
in Florida. Al-WTRs were stored in polyethylene containers at 4 °C
until needed.

Solvent Selection
Containerized
plant production methods
use target pH and EC values in leachates as guidance for managing
nutrients within the pots.33,34 Because these same
properties can affect sorption of pesticides, evaluation of pesticide
sorption must be conducted under similar conditions to maintain relevance.
EC and pH were measured in extracts of individual media components
using three common background extractants: ultrapure water, 10 mM
CaCl2, and 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (8.34 mM KH2PO4 + 1.66 mM K2HPO4, pH
6.5). These three extractants were evaluated to determine their abilities
to produce extracts with pH and EC values within the ranges suitable
for ornamental plant production. The recommended pH and EC values
for industrial production of potted ornamental plants are 5.5–6.5
(pH) and 0.8–1.6 dS m–1 (EC).33,34 The media-to-solution ratio used to characterize pH and EC was 1:5
(v/v) based on recommended methods for analysis of loose growing media.35 Sodium azide (100 mg L–1)
was included in the phosphate buffer to minimize pesticide degradation
due to microbial activity. Acidity was further neutralized in the
buffered solutions with the organic components (coir, pine bark, and
peat) by addition of calcium hydroxide (2 mM Ca(OH)2).
Individual media components and extract solutions (1:5 v/v) were added
into 500 mL plastic bottles, which were then shaken for 1 h on an
Eberbach horizontal shaker. After shaking, the bottles were placed
on a lab bench for 15 min to allow settling of the larger particles.
The clear supernatant solutions were filtered through Whatman #1 filter
paper and immediately stored in amber glass bottles. The pH and EC
measurements were made in 250 mL beakers at 22 °C. Extract pH
was determined using a benchtop pH meter with a silver chloride electrode
(Fisherbrand accumet AP100). EC was measured using a Digital-Aid portable
EC meter (Clearwater, Florida, USA). Both pH and EC meters were calibrated
according to manufacturer recommendations using standardized pH buffers
(pH 4, 7, and 10, Fisher Chemical) and KCl solutions (1, 5, 10 mM),
respectively. Following measurements, media extracts (water, 10 mM
CaCl2, and phosphate buffer) were stored at 4 °C for
later use during the calibration and validation of the analytical
methods.

Sorption Isotherms
To evaluate sorption, 2 g of each
individual media component or the Al-WTRs and 20 mL of the most appropriate
solvent (identified above) were added into 50 mL Teflon [poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
PTFE] Oakridge centrifuge tubes. These ratios produced a mass/solution
ratio of 1:10. Each pesticide was spiked into the aqueous phase in
the tube. The Oakridge tubes were then shaken on an Eberbach horizontal
shaker for 24 h to achieve equilibrium between the solvent and solid
phases. This incubation period was based on literature reports where
equilibrium was achieved after shaking for 12 h for imidacloprid in
Florida soils (>95% sand and <1% organic C content),36 and after shaking for 24 h for metalaxyl-M sorption
to several organic substrates (compost, chopped willow, straw, coconut
chips, peat mix, and manure).19 No references
were available for acephate or paclobutrazol sorption, but preliminary
studies confirmed that 24 h was adequate for achieving equilibrium.
After equilibrating, tubes were placed in a stationary rack to allow
settling of the larger solid materials. The liquid fraction was then
removed for preparation and analysis.

To initially screen the
materials for sorptive activity, one-point sorption isotherms were
conducted at a single pesticide concentration with all combinations
of media components (peat, pine bark, coir, sand, perlite, vermiculite,
and Al-WTRs) and pesticides. Pesticide spiking concentrations (4.75–5.28
mg L–1) were based on the label-recommended application
rates for ornamentals (Table 2). Based on the results from these assays, the most surface-active
materials were further evaluated using 5-point batch isotherms.

Based on significant interactions observed in the one-point isotherm
studies, peat, pine bark, Al-WTRs, and sand were selected to evaluate
sorption using five-point sorption isotherms (Table 2). Sand was included as a control treatment
where sorption or interaction was minimal. The spiking levels for
the 5-point isotherms were based on both the recommended application
rates listed on product labels and the water solubility of the pesticide
(Table 2). The Freundlich
and Langmuir mathematical models used to characterize pesticide sorption
isotherms are well-established in the literature and have been explained
in reviews.37,38

Extract Preparation and
Analysis
Prior to analysis,
sample solutions for most compounds were filtered through Target2
0.2 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) syringe filters with a
30 mm housing (Thermo Scientific catalog #F2500-6). The filtered solutions
were transferred into 2 mL amber glass high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) vials. However, the filtration step reduced the recoveries
of paclobutrazol from most substrates by 31–50%, except in
the peat and Al-WTRs matrixes which had recoveries of 134 and 95%,
respectively. As a result, the PVDF filtration step was omitted for
analysis of paclobutrazol samples. Instead, these samples were centrifuged
in the same 50 mL Oakridge Teflon tubes (15 min, 5000 rpm) where the
batch equilibrium study was conducted. Afterward, 2 mL aliquots were
taken from the clear supernatant and were directly injected into the
analytical system for analysis.

Pesticide concentrations
in the aqueous supernatants from the sorption isotherm studies were
analyzed at the Organic Contaminants Analytical Research Laboratory
housed in the Soil and Water Sciences Department (University of Florida,
Gainesville), using the liquid chomatography conditions described
by CDFA (2013).51 Briefly, acephate, imidacloprid,
metalaxyl-M and paclobutrazol were analyzed by direct injection (10
μL) into a Waters 2695 HPLC (Waters Corp., Milford MA, USA)
equipped with a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro-RP column (80 Å, 50
× 2 mm, 4 μm) and coupled to a Micromass Quattro Ultima
MS/MS system (Waters Corp., Milford MA, USA) operated in the single-ion
monitoring mode with one quantifier and one qualifier m/z. The m/z transitions
used included m/z 184 > 125 (quantifier)
and 184 > 143 (qualifier) for acephate, m/z 256 > 175 (quantifier) and 256 > 209 (qualifier)
for imidacloprid, m/z 280 > 192
(quantifier) and 280 > 220
(qualifier) for metalaxyl-M, and m/z 294 > 70 (quantifier) and 294 > 125 (qualifier) for paclobutrazol.
Conditions used to perform m/z transitions
are summarized in Table 4. Run time per sample was 15 min, with retention times of 1.16 min
(acephate), 2.50 min (imidacloprid), 8.84 min (paclobutrazol), and
9.22 min (metalaxyl-M).

The potential for co-extraction of interfering constituents was
evaluated by comparing instrument responses for each pesticide spiked
into extractant alone and spiked into the media extracts. When substantial
deviations in responses occurred between the two, matrix-matched calibration
curves were warranted. As a result of these studies, calibration curves
were built in reagent-grade water, as well as in pesticide-free extracted
matrices described earlier. Most calibration standard curves included
concentrations of 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 ng mL–1. The minimum acceptable R2 for calibration
curves was 0.99. To evaluate the influence of the filtering step on
accuracy and recoveries, pesticides were spiked into extraction solutions
in tubes without substrates, which were then shaken as previously
described followed by analysis by direct injection before and after
filtration. The limits of detection (LODs) were calculated using pesticide-free
matrices extracted from each substrate component using the isotherm
incubation method described earlier. Each pesticide was spiked into
the pesticide-free supernatant to achieve concentrations of 100, 200,
or 500 ng mL–1 before analysis (Table 5). The spiking levels differed
between pesticides and individual media components because of matrix
effects on analyte signals. The LOD was calculated using LOD = sd
× t, where sd is the standard deviation of the
spikes (n = 8), and t is the one-tailed t statistic for 99% confidence with n –
1 degrees of freedom (Smith, 1999).39 LODs
ranged from 0.02 to 0.10 mg L–1 for acephate, 0.02–0.19
mg L–1 for imidacloprid, 0.02–0.08 mg L–1 for paclobutrazol, and 0.02–0.10 mg L–1 for metalaxyl-M (Table 5).

Statistical
Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed
using SigmaPlot 14 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, California, USA).
Pesticide sorption coefficients (and corresponding variance estimates)
were optimized using linear and nonlinear regression procedures based
upon the Marquardt–Levenberg algorithm. Media component effects
on sorption of the initial mass applied was evaluated with one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the significance level set at 0.05.
The Holm–Sidak method was used for multiple comparisons after
detecting significant differences between sorption means in the one-way
ANOVA procedure. The goodness-of-fit of the linear regression models
selected for the sorption isotherms was evaluated using the coefficient
of determination (R2).40,41
