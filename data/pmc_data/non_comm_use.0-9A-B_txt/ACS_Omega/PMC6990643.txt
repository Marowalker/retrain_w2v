The high costs for producing catalysts
for fuel cells combined
with low efficiency in oxygen reduction make metal–organic
complexes a promising alternative to noble-metal catalysts. The electrochemical
activity of Cu-complex-based catalysts has been reported by many authors,
but only a few works are devoted to theoretical studies. In this manuscript,
we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a CuII complex of
3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole. The determining steps for the associative
and dissociative mechanisms are the oxygen adsorption and the oxygen
bond cleavage, respectively. The barrier for breaking the O–O
bond in the dissociative mechanism was estimated at 0.7 eV.

==== Body
Introduction
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the
cathodic reaction in energy-converting
devices such as fuel cells, which are still limited by the absence
of efficient catalysts.1−3 Pt-based catalysts are the most used for ORR because
of their electrochemical properties, such as high activity and electrochemical
stability and durability in acid media.2 However, the high cost of platinum makes commercial production of
fuel cells economically nonviable.4 Metal–organic
complexes are a promising alternative to Pt-based catalysts. Gewirth
and co-workers showed that a copper complex of 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole
supported on carbon black has a very high activity for oxygen reduction.5 Although many works report on the activity of
Cu-complex-based catalysts,5−11 there is lack of information from the theoretical point of view.

Computational methods based on density functional theory (DFT)
afford a convenient and practical means of investigating the thermodynamics
of many processes.12−14 Such methods are commonly used in the study of a
great variety of materials, as they do not require the preparation
and testing of the large numbers of specimens demanded by experimental
investigations.15 Besides, these methods
can be considered a crucial complement to experimental techniques
in which some information is difficult to access. DFT calculations
can be used to introduce useful information about the ORR on a copper-based
complex employed as the catalyst material. The energetics associated
with the interaction between the species are fundamental in the study
of electrocatalysis of the reactions involved in fuel cells, and the
density of states (DOS) plots enable the evaluation of orbitals participating
in this interaction.

To provide relevant information about oxygen
reduction, in this
manuscript, we use DFT calculations to investigate the mechanisms
for ORR on a CuII complex of 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole
(Hdatrz).

Results and Discussion
Geometry and Electronic Structure
A proper understanding
of the ORR demands an adequate description of the active sites on
the catalytic material, both with regard to the arrangement of atoms
and the electronic structure.

The geometry of the [CuII(Hdatrz)·5H2O·2SO4] complex was fully
optimized, and the resulting structure is represented in Figure 1A; the complex is
pentahydrated and each Cu atom is connected to a sulfate. Water molecules
and sulfates are omitted in Figure 1B to provide more clarity. The Cu–Cu distance
after optimization is of the order of 3.4 Å, in good agreement
with the value reported in ref (5). Computational details are described in Appendix A.

Figure 1 (A) [CuII(Hdatrz)·5H2O·2SO4] complex. (B) Water molecules and sulfates are omitted for
clarity.

Both species O* and HO* adsorb
on one of the Cu atoms with a distance
of 2.39 and 2.33 Å, respectively. HOO* adsorbs on a nitrogen
atom (Cu–N), 2.78 Å away from it. Also, the molecular
species, O2* and H2O*, are somewhat apart from the [CuII(Hdatrz)] complex, 3.54 and 3.84 Å, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the
density of states plots projections onto the d orbital of copper and
p orbital of nitrogen atoms in the [CuII(Hdatrz)] complex
and the p orbital of the oxygen in the adsorbed species. For the projections,
we selected the atoms of Cu and N closest to the interacting species,
therefore, those with the highest contribution to the DOS. O* strongly
interacts with both the d orbital of copper and the p orbital of nitrogen,
in which there is a significant change in the structure of these orbitals
compared to the pure complex (Figure 2A,C). The shoulder in the range of −1 to 0 eV
for the Cu d orbital disappears. Also, for the N p orbital, the structure
below −3 eV completely changes. The oxygen 2p orbital in the
HO* and HOO* species interacts with the nitrogen 2p of the complex,
while no meaningful change in the structure of the copper d orbital
is observed. Calculated binding energy of O* is about 5.3 eV, followed
by HO* (2.9 eV) and HOO* (0.5 eV). On the other hand, the interaction
of molecular species with the complex are weaker, of the order of
0.3 eV.

ORR Mechanisms
In the present work, we investigated
two distinct mechanisms for the ORR: associative and dissociative
(this with two possible routes). While in the former, the cleavage
of the O–O bond does not occur before hydrogenation; in the
latter, the bond breaking is an important condition before the hydrogenation
process. Both mechanisms start with the chemisorption of the O2 molecule. In the following, we present the reaction steps
for the associative mechanism 1   2   3   4   5  

The free
energy diagram for the associative
mechanism is depicted in Figure 3. We calculate the free energies using the method outlined
in Appendix B. Two configurations were considered:
under standard conditions (pH = 0, p = 1 bar, T = 298 K, and U = 0) and changing the
electrode potential to U = 1.23 V (the maximum operating
potential of fuel cells). The pH was chosen to be zero, hence considering
the reaction steps are in acid media.

Figure 3 ORR free energy diagram for the associative
mechanism.

O2 adsorption precedes
hydrogenation, and at potential U = 0.0 V, this step
is uphill and all other steps are downhill.
As shown in the DOS plots (Figure 2B), HOO is weakly adsorbed to the complex (small interaction
with the 2p orbital of nitrogen), thus favoring the breaking of the
HO–O bond, which leads to water and O* formation (step 3). Despite the strong binding
energy of O*, at low potentials, the hydrogenation weakens the interaction
with the [CuII(Hdatrz)] complex, making the reaction in step 4 exergonic. The same
holds for hydrating HO* (step 5), the binding energy drops to 0.34 eV and water is formed.
Considering the high potential of 1.23 V, only the adsorption of O
is downhill and all other steps are uphill.

The reaction steps
that were considered in our investigation for
the dissociative mechanism are shown below 6   7   8   9   10  

Alternatively,
the dissociative mechanism may occur by a different
route, with reactions 11 and 12 replacing reactions 8 and 9, respectively 11   12  

The two
possible routes for the dissociative mechanism are displayed
in the free energy diagram in Figure 4. Oxygen dissociation takes place before hydrogenation,
and for this step, the barrier was estimated at 0.7 eV. Using the
zero cell potential, U = 0.0 V, subsequent steps
are downhill. The dissociation barrier of the O2 molecule
was determined using a series of calculations moving the molecule
toward the [CuII(Hdatrz)] complex. The O–O interaction
weakens during the approach, and the energy reaches a maximum (transition
state). The bond length at the transition state is 1.52 Å (against
1.26 Å in the gas phase). The oxygen is parallel to the [CuII(Hdatrz)] complex, with each oxygen directing to opposite
Cu–N bonds. As previously pointed out, hydrogenation weakens
the interaction with the [CuII(Hdatrz)] complex at low
potentials. At U = 1.23 V and after breaking the
oxygen bond, the steps are uphill. Reaction 11 is approximately 0.3 eV more favorable than reaction 8. Through this mechanism,
there is no formation of HOO*.

mechanism.

Conclusions
Few
theoretical works report on the use of copper-based complexes
as catalyst materials for ORR. The [CuII(Hdatrz)] complex
is presented as an alternative to noble-metal-based catalysts providing
good activity at affordable prices. The theoretical method employed
in our investigation constitutes a highly useful tool to assist in
the elucidation of processes occurring in the electrochemical environment.
DFT calculations were performed to describe the geometric properties
and the electronic structure of the complex, and its interaction with
some species. Our results show that oxygen adsorption is the determining
step for the associative mechanism. On the other hand, for the dissociative
mechanism, the process should overcome a barrier of the order of 0.7
eV to cleavage the oxygen bond before hydrogenation.

Appendix
A. Computer methods
All DFT calculations were carried out
using the SIESTA code.16 SIESTA uses a
numerical linear combination of
atomic orbitals as the basis set and describes the core–electron
interaction using norm-conserving pseudopotentials in the Kleinman–Bylander
form.17 Exchange and correlation interactions
were treated with the PBE18,19 generalized gradient
approximation functional. For comparison, the PW91 exchange–correlation
functional20,21 was also used for geometry optimization.
We considered the PBE functional more suitable and employed it to
the rest of the calculations.

First, we performed the geometry
optimization of the [CuII(Hdatrz)·5H2O·2SO4] complex and the
convergence criterion was achieved when the force on each atom was
less than 0.04 eV/Å. To calculate the interaction with O2, HOO, O, HO, and H2O, each species was placed
close to the complex and the optimization procedure was repeated with
all atoms free to move.

To calculate the barrier to break the
O–O bond in the dissociative
mechanism, we bring the O2 molecule closer to the [CuII(Hdatrz)] complex, in steps of 0.1 Å, fixing the oxygen
atoms on the orthogonal axis only. While approaching the molecule
to the complex, the bond length increases and the energy rises to
a maximum. After that, the energy decreases and each oxygen atom adsorbs
to a site. The nudged elastic band (NEB) method could be also an option
to calculate the transition state since both the initial (O2) and final (2O*) states are well-known. We used the NEB method elsewhere.14

Details on the method used to calculate
the differences in the
free energies presented in this manuscript can be found in the next
appendix.

Appendix B. Free Energy Calculation
Here, we summarize
the method used for calculating the differences
in the free energy for the ORR. The procedure was proposed by Nørskov
et al.12

The reference potential
is set to be that of the standard hydrogen electrode, and the chemical
potential for the reaction H+ + e– can
be related to that of 1/2H2 in the gas phase, which is
in equilibrium under standard conditions (pH = 0, p = 1 bar, T = 298 K, and U = 0) 13  

Differences in the free energy, ΔG, are
calculated using the equation 14  where ΔE is the interaction
energy obtained directly from DFT calculations, ΔZPE is the
change in the zero-point energy, and the values used in the present
study are taken from ref (12).TΔS is the entropic
term whose values were obtained from standard tables for gas-phase
molecules,22 ΔGpH is the contribution of the H+ concentration to
the free energy (in our study we considered pH = 0), and ΔGU is the shift in energy at specific electrode
potential for all states involving an electron in the electrode (−eU).

For pH other than zero, one can correct the free
energy of H+ ions using the equation 15  

In eq 15, kB is the Boltzmann constant.

At standard conditions ΔG (pH = 0 and U = 0) = ΔG0, and eq 14 becomes 16  

Change in the free energy of O2, ΔG0 = 4.92 eV, was derived
from the reaction 2H2O → O2 + 2H2 using experimental values.
Besides, the entropy for gas-phase water was taken at p = 0.035 bar and T = 298 K, in which this is in
equilibrium with liquid water.
