The stainless steel
mesh (SSM) has received growing consideration
as an electrocatalyst for efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution
reactions. Recently, the application of SSM as an oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) electrocatalyst has been more promising, while its
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity is very low,
which definitely affects its overall water splitting activity. Herein,
a simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method followed by phosphorization
is employed to significantly boost the overall water splitting performance
of SSM. The CBD method could allow the voids between the SSM fibers
to be filled with Ni and P. Electrocatalytic studies show that the
CBD-treated and phosphorized stainless steel (denoted SSM-Ni-P) exhibits
an HER overpotential of 149 mV, while the phosphorization-free CBD-treated
SSM (denoted as SSM-Ni) delivers an OER overpotential of 223 mV, both
at a current density of 10 mA cm–2. An asymmetric
alkaline electrolyzer assembled based on the SSM-Ni-P cathode (HER)
and SSM-Ni anode (OER) achieved an onset and 10 mA cm–2 current densities at an overall potential of 1.62 V, granting more
prospects for the application of inexpensive and highly active electrocatalysts
for electrocatalytic water splitting reactions.

Introduction
Highly efficient electrolytic
processes such as hydrogen and oxygen
evolution reactions are in high demand for the production of clean
energy such as hydrogen fuel.1−7 Compared to the mature hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the
acidic medium,8−10 oxygen evolution reactions (OER) have intrinsic advantages
in alkaline media (4OH– → 2H2O
+ O2 + 4e–) in terms of easy production
of oxygen molecules evolving from the electrocatalysts11−14 and straightforward assembly of the overall alkaline electrolytic
device.15,16 However, the sluggishness in the reaction
kinetics17,18 usually leads to the unsatisfactory catalytic
activity of the electrocatalysts during the overall water splitting
process.19,20 The utilization of not only noble metal
oxides such as IrO2 and RuO221,22 but also other transition metal compounds as promising OER catalysts23,24 has shown undoubtedly enhanced performance in the assembly of the
overall water splitting devices.25,26 These electrocatalysts
are mostly prepared on 2D planar27 and
3D substrate structures28−30 especially glassy carbon31 and nickel foam/carbon cloth,32−34 respectively,
thereby forming substrate-assisted catalysts.35,36 However, despite the successful fabrication of these catalysts on
2D and 3D structures, the tendency of the active materials peeling
off from the substrates remains an unquestionable challenge,33,37−39 which should be urgently addressed.

One of
the promising approaches to address the tendency of the
catalysts peeling off from the substrates is fabricating self-supporting
electrocatalysts.38 On the race to accomplishing
the abovementioned approach, the stainless steel mesh (SSM) especially
the 304-, 316-, and AISI 304-type has attracted great attention38,40−42 not only due to its low cost but also its chemical
stability in the alkaline environment.43−45 SSM has shown impressive
performance as an OER electrocatalyst in its pristine form37,38 and significant performance enhancement upon different facile surface
modification or exfoliation methods to improve its surface area.46,47 Nevertheless, the HER performance of SSM is less attractive due
to its limited active sites.47 Impressive
efforts have been explored to boost the HER performance of SSM,41,47 with less advancement, which definitely affects the development
of self-supporting SSM-based alkaline electrolyzers.38,41,47

Herein, we demonstrated
that simple chemical bath deposition (CBD)
followed by phosphorization strategy clearly enhanced the HER catalytic
activity of SSM and its application as a cathode in the assembly of
the alkaline electrolyzer successfully boosted its overall water splitting
activity. Phosphorization is an effective strategy to enhance the
HER properties of electrocatalysts due to its stability and tendency
to promote hydrogen adsorption and water dissociation during HER.38,48,49 However, fewer reports have been
found to enhance the HER catalytic performance of SSM via phosphorization.41 In addition, incorporation of Ni could effectively
increase the active sites of electrocatalysts, which is beneficial
for enhancing both the HER and OER performances of the electrocatalysts.48,50 The facile and scalable CBD process of the SSM involves simple immersion
of pristine SSM in boiled nickel chloride solution for only 120 s
followed by phosphorization. As a result, Ni-rich CBD-treated SSM
(SSM-Ni) exhibits an overpotential of 223 mV at a current density
of 10 mA cm–2, while the Ni-rich phosphorus-doped
SSM (SSM-Ni-P) reaches a current density of 10 mA cm–2 at an overpotential of 149 mV, resulting in an overall water splitting
potential of 1.62 V. The enhanced water splitting activity is based
on the enriched Ni active sites of SSM for the OER and the dual incorporation
of Ni and P active sites for the HER. This work opens more opportunity
for the optimization, cost-effective, and scalable fabrication of
overall water splitting devices based on SSM.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of SSM-Ni
First, 304 stainless steel SSM
(1000 mesh) (Foshan Guangmei Stainless Steel Co., Ltd.) with 2 ×
3 cm was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and distilled
water and then dried in an oven at 60 °C. After that, the stainless
steel was put into a boiling solution containing 0.5 M NaNO3 and 2 M NiCl2·6H2O for 120 s and dried
naturally at room temperature.

Synthesis of SSM-Ni-P
For phosphorization, 500 mg of
sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2·H2O) and SSM-Ni were put at two separate positions in a porcelain boat
with NaH2PO2·H2O at the upstream
side of the three-temperature zone tube furnace and the SSM-Ni at
the second-temperature zone. The sample was heated at 400 °C
for 60 min with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere
with a flow rate of 200 sccm. After natural cooling, the SSM-Ni-P
sample was obtained.

Synthesis of SSM-P
SSM-P was prepared
under the same
conditions as SSM-Ni-P, but pristine SSM was used instead of SSM-Ni.

Materials Characterization
The morphology was characterized
by a scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Quanta 400/INCA/HKL). An
X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab) was used to derive the
crystalline structure of the as-prepared samples. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (FESEM, Quanta 400/INCA/HKL) was performed on an ESCALab250
to determine the chemical compositions and valence states in the samples.

Electrochemical Characterization
All the electrochemical
tests were carried out on a CH Instruments electrochemical workstation
(CH760E) with a three-electrode system in which the Pt wire was used
as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl solution was used
as the reference electrode, and the prepared sample was directly used
as the self-supporting working electrode. During the test, the prepared
sample was sealed with epoxy resin, leaving only an area of 1.0 cm2 for contact with the 1 M KOH solution and a small area at
the other end for ohmic contact.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction
Test
OER overpotential was
calculated according to the following equation: overpotential (mV)
= (measurement potential (vs SCE) + 0.197 + 0.059 × pH –
1.229 (vs REH)) × 1000. The polarization curve (LSV) was measured
between 0.0 and 1.0 (vs SCE) at a scanning rate of 1 mV/s, and the
Tafel graph was measured at the same scanning speed. The Tafel slope
was derived from the equation η = b log j + a, where η, b, and j are the overpotential, Tafel slope, and
current density, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements were performed at a current density of 20 mA/cm2 with an ac amplitude applied of 5 mV and frequency range
of 0.01–1000 kHz. The constant current stability of the working
electrode was carried out for 25 h under the condition of intense
stirring of the electrolyte.

Hydrogen Evolution Test
HER overpotential
was calculated
according to the following equation: overpotential (mV) = (measurement
potential (vs SCE) + 0.197 + 0.059 × pH – 0 (vs REH))
× 1000. The polarization curve (LSV) was measured between −1.0
and −2.0 (vs SCE) at a scanning rate of 1 mV/s. Tafel, EIS,
and stability tests were the same as those of the OER tests above.

Overall Water Splitting Test
SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P were
used as anode and cathode materials, respectively, to measure the
LSV curve in 1 M KOH solution at a scanning rate of 1 mV/s between
1.0 and 2.0 V. Also, the constant current stability analysis for 25
h was carried out in the process of intense agitation.

Results
and Discussion
Morphological and Electronic Properties
SSM-Ni can
be obtained by a simple CBD method, and SSM-Ni-P can be obtained by
phosphorization of CBD-derived SSM-Ni as shown in Scheme 1. The CBD process involved
simple immersion of clean SSM into boiling solution for just 120 s
to obtain the SSM-Ni sample (Scheme 1a). The solution contains 2 M NiCl2·6H2O and 0.37 mmol of NaNO3. After drying, the pristine
SSM and CBD-treated SSM (SSM-Ni) were subjected to morphological characterization. Figure 1a,b displays the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pristine SSM and SSM-Ni,
respectively. The surfaces of both samples appear very smooth. However,
the voids in SSM is open (yellow dazed area in Figure 1a), while the voids in SSM-Ni are filled
up (red dazed area in Figure 1b). Compared to the elemental mapping of SSM (Figure S1), the elemental mapping of SSM-Ni in Figure S2 shows that the filled-void area consists
of the Ni element. After phosphorization of SSM-Ni using N2 gas at 400 °C for 60 min (Scheme 1b), the morphology of the newly formed SSM-Ni-P
sample also shows that the voids are filled (blue dazed areas in Figure 1c). The mapping spectrum
shows the presence of P confirming successful phosphorization (Figure 1d). Elemental mapping
in Figure 1e–j
clearly shows that the filled-void positions in the SSM-Ni-P sample
are characterized with Ni and P. According to the results obtained
from the EDS elemental mapping of SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P samples in Figure 3e–j and Figure S2, we believe that Ni exists both at
the surface and voids between the SSM fibers. According to Table S1 and Figure 1d inset, the Fe atomic composition in the
SSM sample reduces from 70.41 to 66.06 in SSM-Ni and 58.71 in SSM-Ni-P,
like those of Cr, while the atomic composition of Ni increases from
7.45 in SSM to 8.71 in SSM-Ni and slightly reduces to 8.16 in SSM-Ni-P.
It should be pointed out that previous reports have demonstrated the
reduction of both Fe and Cr compositions could lead to an increase
in their catalytic performances.42,44 Hence, we
proposed that the catalytic properties of SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P should
be improved with respect to that of SSM.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route of Both SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P Samples
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS)
analyses were used to study the phase and electronic structure characterization
of the SSM, SSM-Ni, and SSM-Ni-P samples. Based on the XRD spectra
in Figure S3, the three samples consist
of the austenite-type stainless steel (PDF card #33-0397)38 and the three samples depict no notable difference.

The result implies that the CBD and phosphorization processes have
no specific effect on the phase properties of the samples. The XPS
spectra of the three samples confirmed the presence of Fe, Cr, Ni,
and O, while that of SSM-Ni-P is characterized with an additional
P peak (Figure S4). The Fe 2p XPS spectra
of SSM, SSM-Ni, and SSM-Ni-P are shown in Figure 2a. The peak around 707.0 eV is assigned to
the Fe0 peak,38 and the peak
around 710.8 eV is assigned to the Fe peak in the FeCr alloy.51,52 It can be observed that the Fe0 peak of SSM shifted to
the higher binding energy, suggesting oxidation of the Fe0 and changes in the electronic states of SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P. In
addition, the Cr 2p XPS spectra of the three samples are compared
in Figure 2b. The peak
around 573.2 eV corresponding to Cr0 disappears in SSM-Ni-P,
suggesting the removal of elemental Cr in the phosphorized sample.
Moreover, the peak around 576.2 eV corresponding to Cr in the FeCr
alloy51,52 in the SSM sample also shifted to the higher
binding energy in both SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P, indicating oxidation or
modification in the electronic structures of both SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P.
According to Figure 2c, the Ni peak around 852.8 eV that is assigned to the zero oxidation
state of Ni (i.e., Ni0) is negligible in SSM but prominent
in those of SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P, confirming that both samples are
Ni-rich. Furthermore, the peak around the binding energy of 856.1
eV in SSM-Ni suggests the presence of the Ni peak of Ni2+ from NiCl2,38,52 while the intensities
of these peaks reduced in SSM-Ni-P prescribing the binding of Ni with
phosphorus. Moreover, XPS results further justify that Ni exists in
both Ni0 and Ni2+ forms. It should be pointed
out that the Ni2+ does not turn into Ni0 after
phosphating, indicating the presence of Ni2+ from NiCl2 in both SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P samples. Moreover, the origin
of Ni0 might be related to the strong order of electroactivity
of Fe compared to Ni; that is, Fe can easily reduce Ni. Hence, due
to the higher composition of Fe in SSM, more composition of Ni0 can be found observed according to the XPS results. Indeed,
only SSM-Ni-P features the presence of P, while those of SSM and SSM-Ni
are phosphorus-free according to the P 2p XPS spectra in Figure 2d. The XPS analysis
confirms that, after CBD treatment and phosphorization, the surface
and electronic properties of both SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P have been modified.
Such modifications have also been proven to be of positive significance
to improve OER and HER properties of electrocatalysts.53

Electrocatalytic Properties
Both
the HER and OER catalytic
properties were tested in a three-electrode configuration system using
our three as-prepared electrocatalysts as the working electrode, carbon
rod counter electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and
1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. First, the HER linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV) curves of the electrocatalysts are shown in Figure 3a-I.

LSV curves
of SSM, SSM-Ni, and SSM-Ni-P. (b) HER and (c) OER Tafel plots of SSM,
SSM-Ni, and SSM-Ni-P electrocatalysts.

Among the compared three catalysts, SSM-Ni-P delivers a 10 mA cm–2 current density at an overpotential of 149 mV, displaying
the best HER performance compared to those of SSM-Ni and SSM at 346
and 402 mV, respectively. Insights on the kinetics of the electrocatalysts
were studied using Tafel slopes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS). Figure 3b shows
the HER Tafel plots of SSM, SSM-Ni, and SSM-Ni-P electrocatalysts.
The Tafel slope of SSM-Ni-P is 80 mV dec–1, which
is also significantly smaller than those of SSM (136 mV dec–1) and SSM-Ni (145 mV dec–1). Moreover, the charge
transfer resistance Rct (i.e., semicircle
in the Nyquist plots) of SSM-Ni-P also remains the smallest among
the compared samples, further confirming the enhanced kinetics of
SSM-Ni-P over those of SSM-Ni and SSM (Figure S5a). The improved performance can be attributed to the synergistic
contribution of both Ni and P, creating more active surface and sites
for efficient evolution of hydrogen.

Thus, the active electrochemical
surface areas (ECSAs) of the three
tested electrocatalysts were further performed to justify the superiority
in the performance of SSM-Ni-P as shown in Figure S6. Figure S6a–c shows the
cyclic voltammetry curves in the voltage range of −0.71 to
−0.73 V and different scan rates of 20, 50, 100, and 200 mV
s–1. According to the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value that were obtained from the different
CV curves at different scan rates, the Cdl of SSM-Ni-P is 18.8 mF cm–2, while those of SSM-Ni
and SSM are 40 and 1.7 mF cm–2, respectively (Figure 4a). Thus, with an
electrode area of 0.5 cm2, the HER ECSAs of SSM, SSM-Ni,
and SSM-Ni-P are 28, 35, and 313 cm–2ECSA, respectively, assuming that the specific capacitance of the catalysts
is 60 μF cm–2.54,55 The normalized
LSV curves to ECSA further reveal that SSM-Ni-P displayed the lowest
potential and Tafel slope compared to SSM-Ni and SSM, indicating intrinsic
catalytic activity of the SSM-Ni-P electrocatalyst (Figure 4b). Due to the fact that we
study the electrocatalytic performance of the electrocatalysts using
the Hg/HgO reference electrode, we redetermined the double-layer capacitance
values of the electrocatalysts. The SSM-Ni-P electrocatalyst still
displayed a much higher double-layer capacitance value than SSM-Ni
and SSM (Figure S7). Thus, based on similar
morphological structures of SSM-Ni-P and SSM-Ni, we proposed that
the higher double-layer capacitance value of SSM-Ni-P might be attributed
to the phosphorization process, which increases the HER catalytic
sites compared to that of SSM-Ni.

a function of scan rate

curves obtained from panel (a) to ECSA. (c) Plots of the capacitive
currents as a function of scan rate for the three electrocatalysts
during OER and (d) the normalized LSV curves obtained from panel (c)
to ECSA.

The higher Cdl value of SSM-Ni-P over
those of SSM-Ni and SSM indicates that SSM-Ni-P is characterized with
the highest active sites for the HER process, further indicating the
reasons for the superior performance of the SSM-Ni-P electrocatalyst.
To have deep insight on the impact of phosphorization on the SSM-Ni-P
catalyst, pristine SSM was directly annealed with the same condition
as SSM-Ni-P (details in the Experimental Section) without CBD treatment and the performance was compared with that
of SSM and denoted as SSM-P. Interestingly, the HER performance of
SSM-P is not only superior to that of SSM (Figure S8a) but also superseded that of SSM-Ni (Figure S8b). Moreover, the Tafel slope, Rct, and Cdl values of SSM-P
further confirmed the better HER of SSM-P over SSM and SSM-Ni (Figure S8c–f), justifying that the phosphorization
process greatly contributed to the HER performance of SSM-Ni-P electrocatalysts.

During the OER, both SSM-Ni and SSM-Ni-P nearly show the same overpotential
at 10 mA cm–2 current density, but SSM-Ni displays
superior performance to SSM-Ni-P at higher current densities (Figure 3a-II), suggesting
SSM-Ni as the optimized OER electrocatalyst. In addition, the Cdl value obtained from the CV curves in Figure S9 is 2.9 mF cm–2 for
SSM-Ni, which is also higher than those of SSM-Ni-P (1.7 mF cm–2) and SSM (1.2 mF cm–2) (Figure 4c). By assuming that
the specific capacitance of the electrocatalysts is 60 μF cm–2,54,55 the OER ECSAs of SSM, SSM-Ni,
and SSM-Ni-P are 20, 48, and 28 cm–2ECSA, respectively. After normalization of the OER LSV curves to ECSA,
SSM-Ni still revealed the best catalytic performance compared to SSM-Ni-P
and SSM, also confirming superior intrinsic catalytic activity of
the SSM-Ni-P catalyst (Figure 4d), indicating that the main active sites for the superior
OER performance are from CBD-treatment-induced Ni. Furthermore, the
Tafel slope of SSM-Ni is the smallest (42 mV dec–1), while that of SSM (49 mV dec–1) is even smaller
than that of SSM-Ni-P (43 mV dec–1) (Figure 3c), suggesting that the phosphorization
process may have no effect on the OER kinetics. To have further information
on the OER kinetics, the Nyquist plot recorded shows that the charge
transfer resistances in both SSM-Ni-P and SSM are nearly the same
(Figure S5b), indicating that the phosphorization
process really has no effect on the OER performance. As we performed
the HER, the performance of SSM-P was also compared with that of SSM.
According to Figure S10a–d, both
SSM and SSM-P catalysts display approximately the same features, finally
justifying that the process of phosphorization has no effect in enhancing
the OER performance of SSM. Thus, SSM-Ni was selected as the optimized
OER electrocatalyst and utilized for further OER measurements.

The most important parameter of an electrocatalyst is its durability.
Both SSM-Ni-P and SSM-Ni were subjected to chronoamperometry measurements
at different current densities of 10, 20, 30, and then to 10 mA cm–2 as shown in Figure 5. Both electrocatalysts exhibit excellent stability
up to 25 h. The HER electrocatalyst (SSM-Ni-P) displayed an overpotential
retention of about 95% (Figure 5-i), while the OER electrocatalyst (SSM-Ni) achieved 100%
overpotential retention (Figure 5-iii) after 25 h of durability testing. Both the HER
and OER electrocatalysts still exhibit excellent kinetics after the
stability test (Figure S11a,b). Moreover,
both electrocatalysts also show excellent phase stability (Figure S11c,d).

and SSM-Ni electrocatalysts, respectively, up to 25 h. (i) LSV curves
before and after HER stability test and (ii) SEM image of SSM-Ni-P
electrocatalyst after HER stability test. (iii) LSV curves before
and after HER stability test and (iv) SEM image of SSM-Ni-P electrocatalyst
after HER stability test.

According to the post-morphological characterization of the SSM-Ni-P
electrocatalyst, the SEM image shows that its morphology could be
retained (Figure 5-ii).
Elemental mapping in Figure S12 confirmed
the presence of the elements including their various distributions.
The compositions of Fe, Ni, and P elements reduce, while those of
Ni and O increase, suggesting the formation of nickel oxide and hydroxide
species on the catalyst surface (Table S2), which could play a role in protecting the catalyst during HER
electrolysis. For the post-OER analysis, the morphology of SSM-Ni
could also be maintained (Figure 5-iv). Moreover, same as that of the HER catalyst, all
the elements present in the elemental mapping of the SSM-Ni OER electrocatalyst
were observed (SSM-Ni) (Figure S13), suggesting
excellent stability of the OER catalyst. Additionally, the atomic
compositions of Ni and O also increase as those of other elements
decrease (Table S3) further suggesting
that the oxides or hydroxides of nickel were formed, which could also
serve as protection for the catalyst upon the OER electrolytic process.
All these results confirm the excellent and impressive stability of
SSM-Ni-P and SSM-Ni as efficient and stable HER and OER electrocatalysts,
respectively.

Based on the fact that the testing stability performance
of the
electrocatalyst for a longer period of time using the Ag/AgCl reference
electrode is not quite suitable, we also tested both the HER and OER
performances of the three electrocatalysts using the Hg/HgO reference
electrode. Interestingly, the HER performance of SSM-Ni-P in the Hg/HgO
reference electrode is superior to that in the Ag/AgCl reference electrode
(Figure S14). However, the OER performance
of SSM-Ni in the Hg/HgO reference electrode is inferior to that in
the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Figure S15). It should be pointed out that the enhanced HER performance difference
of SSM-Ni-P using the Ag/AgCl reference electrode compared to the
Hg/HgO reference electrode is the same as the OER performance difference
using the Hg/HgO reference electrode compared to the Ag/AgCl reference
electrode. Hence, the overall water splitting activity of SSM-Ni-P//SSM-Ni
should not be affected. The HER LSV curves using Hg/HgO after the
stability test reduce, while that of OER almost maintains its initial
LSV curve.

Overall Water Splitting Activity
Having discover the
optimized HER and OER electrocatalysts, an alkaline electrolyzer or
overall water splitting based on these electrocatalysts was designed.
The device was denoted as SSM-Ni-P//SSM-Ni. Other alkaline electrolyzers
based on other electrocatalysts were also designed for comparison
such as SSM//SSM, SSM//SSM-Ni-P, SSM-Ni//SSM, SSM-Ni-P//SSM-Ni-P,
SSM-Ni//SSM-Ni, and SSM-Ni-P//SSM-Ni, as shown in Figure 6a. Among the electrolyzers
assembled as mentioned above, SSM-Ni-P//SSM-Ni displayed the best
performance.

When compared with commercial
Pt-C and IrO2 coated on
SSM (denoted SSM/Pt-C//SSM/IrO2), our as-designed SSM-Ni-P//SSM-Ni
delivered an overall potential of 1.62 V, which was comparable to
that of SSM/Pt-C//SSM/IrO2 (Figure 6b), superior to previously reported stainless
steel based overall water splitting devices such as SSFS//SSFS,41 and also comparable to NASSM//NASSM47 (see Table 1 for details and Figure 6c). Finally, the SSM-Ni-P//SSM-Ni electrolyzer was
subjected to 25 h of chronopotentiometric stability testing at different
current densities displaying excellent stability (Figure 6d) with about 99% potential
retention as shown in Figure 6e, potentially demonstrating the utilization of stainless
steel as a promising electrocatalyst for the production of H2 and O2.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the overall
water splitting performance of the stainless
steel mesh (SSM) was significantly enhanced by simple chemical bath
deposition (CBD) followed by phosphorization. The optimized HER and
OER electrocatalysts denoted as SSM-Ni-P and SSM-Ni could reach a
current density of 10 mA cm–2 at lower overpotentials
of 149 and 223 mV, respectively, which allow the assembly of an overall
water splitting device with an overall potential of 1.62 V at 10 mA
cm–2 current density. The CBD method introduced
Ni as the active site, which not only filled up the voids of the SSM
but also was evenly distributed on the catalyst surface for efficient
OER. Phosphorization of the CBD-treated SSM induced more active sites
for achieving efficient HER activity. This work did not only show
great significance toward a simple strategy to improve the catalytic
activities of steel-based electrocatalysts but also portray an easy
scaling-up strategy for commercial utilization.
