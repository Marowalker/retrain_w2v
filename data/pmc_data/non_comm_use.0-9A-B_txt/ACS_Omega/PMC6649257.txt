The dehydration products
of gypsum under different temperature
and water vapor pressure were investigated by thermodynamic theory.
Additionally, the rehydration mechanism of soluble anhydrite was also
studied by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The thermodynamic calculation
results reveal that the dehydration mechanism of gypsum significantly
depended on ambient temperature and water vapor pressure. In the high-temperature
and low water vapor pressure region, gypsum dehydrates to form γ-CaSO4 in a single-step process (CaSO4·2H2O → γ-CaSO4); with increasing water vapor
pressure, gypsum undergoes the CaSO4·2H2O → γ-CaSO4 → β-CaSO4·0.5H2O reaction path and as water vapor pressure
increases further, the occurrence of a two-step conversion path CaSO4·2H2O → β-CaSO4·0.5H2O → γ-CaSO4 was observed. It was also
found that gypsum is stable in the low-temperature and high water
vapor pressure region and does not dehydrate to form any calcium sulfate
hemihydrate. Finally, the rehydration mechanism of soluble anhydrite
was studied by MC simulations. The simulation results are in agreement
with the experimental data and support the finding that γ-CaSO4 rehydration forms CaSO4·0.67H2O in high relative humidity. Another important result revealed by
the MC simulation is that γ-CaSO4 has an extraordinary
ability to capture water molecules from an extremely dry atmosphere,
which is very useful in some fields, such as in drying processes and
even for extracting liquid water from extremely dry atmosphere.

Introduction
Gypsum is one of the
most important minerals on earth, and its
dehydration product, plaster of paris, is mainly used as a building
material. Furthermore, there are abundant deposits of gypsum mineral
in nature; moreover, recent studies have indicated that Mars also
has an abundance of gypsum mineral as well as other mineral calcium
sulfate phases (β-CaSO4·0.5H2O).1−6 Furthermore, both the phosphate industry and thermal power plants
generate large amounts of byproduct gypsum (phosphogypsum, flue gas
desulfurization gypsum, etc.). Extensive efforts have been made to
studying the process of gypsum dehydration. However, the dehydration
mechanisms of gypsum that have been reported in previous studies still
remain confusing and even contradictory. Some researchers have argued
that gypsum undergoes a two-stage dehydration process, where β-CaSO4·0.5H2O is formed first and then γ-CaSO4 is obtained by further dehydration of β-CaSO4·0.5H2O.7−10 McAdie11 studied the gypsum
dehydration process at 124.3 °C under different water vapor partial
pressures. Their experimental results reveal that gypsum dehydration
proceeds through only a single CaSO4·2H2O → γ-CaSO4 step when the ambient water vapor
pressure is less than 26664 Pa; however, a two-step process of CaSO4·2H2O → β-CaSO4·0.5H2O → γ-CaSO4 is observed if the practical
water vapor pressure is greater than 40 130 Pa. Badens et al.12 investigated the dehydration process of gypsum
using a combination of controlled transformation rate thermal analysis
and Laue diffraction, concluding that there is only one dehydration
step from gypsum to γ-CaSO4 at 500 Pa or below; whereas
β-CaSO4·0.5H2O is an intermediate
product when the practical water vapor pressure reaches 900 Pa. Ball
and Norwood13 have argued that γ-CaSO4 is directly obtained during gypsum dehydration at a water
vapor partial pressure range of 1.33 × 10–2 to 6000 Pa and at a temperature below 115 °C. Lou et al.14 studied the dehydration mechanisms of flue gas
desulfurization gypsums and pointed out that gypsum dehydration proceeds
through a one-step process at a negligible partial water vapor pressure
and below 100 °C, while two-step processes are observed at an
autogenous water vapor pressure and a temperature of approximately
100 °C. Abriel et al.15 studied the
dehydration mechanism of gypsum using neutron and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and proposed a novel gypsum dehydration pathway of CaSO4·2H2O → CaSO4·0.75H2O → γ-CaSO4. Prasad et al.16 and Carbone et al.17 investigated the dehydration mechanism of gypsum using in situ micro-Raman
and energy-dispersive XRD, respectively, and concluded that γ-CaSO4 was first obtained in the gypsum dehydration process, and
then the formed γ-CaSO4 was transformed into β-CaSO4·0.5H2O by a rehydration reaction in which
0.5H2O water molecules reentered into the crystal structure
of γ-CaSO4.

To date, much effort has been made
to researching the dehydration
pathways of gypsum; however, it is still not well understood. In this
study, a theoretical thermodynamics approach was employed to elucidate
the dehydration pathways of gypsum.

Theoretical and Simulation
Methods
Monte Carlo Simulations
The number of sorbates is allowed
to vary in the grand canonical ensemble (μVT). In view of this,
adsorption isotherms were calculated using grand canonical Monte Carlo
(GCMC) simulations with the Metropolis algorithm.18 The GCMC simulations were carried out using periodic boundary
conditions of 3 × 3 × 3 unit cells of γ-CaSO4.

The water molecules used in the simulation calculations are
rigid molecules. The force field plays a key role in MC simulations.
In this work, the DREIDING force field19 was employed to model all interactions between water molecules and
the γ-CaSO4 lattice. The theoretical formulae of
the nonbonded interactions in the DREIDING force field are represented
by the 12-6 LJ potential and Coulombic terms 1   2   3  where rij and σij are the actual and
reference distances between atoms i and j, respectively; εo is the permittivity of free space
(εo = 8.8543 × 10–12 C2 J–1 m–1); εij is the potential well-depth; and qi and qj are the value of the charge on atoms i and j. The LJ interactions between unlike
atoms are treated with the sixth-order mixing rule.20

The atom-based summation method with a cutoff distance
of 0.15
nm was employed to compute both the Coulombic interactions and the
van der Waals interactions between the water molecules, the calcium
sulfate framework, and the hydrogen bond terms in the system (spline
width: 0.1 nm; buffer width: 0.05 nm). The MC simulations were performed
at 215 and 298 K. The coupling to the heating bath was carried out
using a Nose thermostat.

Thermodynamic Data for CaSO4·2H2O,
β-CaSO4·0.5H2O, and H2O(g)
Thermodynamics is a rigorous theory and is widely used
in chemistry, materials science, metallurgy, and other fields. The
large number of thermodynamic calculations used in this work is very
helpful for determining the gypsum dehydration pathways.

The
standard Gibbs energy of formation values of CaSO4·2H2O, β-CaSO4·0.5H2O, γ-CaSO4, and H2O(g) can be obtained from the literature;21,22 these thermodynamic data are crucial for calculating the phase equilibrium
of the CaSO4–H2O system. Thermodynamic
data are generally tabulated in the literature at the interval of
100 K, which is inconvenient for thermodynamic calculations. Therefore,
it was necessary to fit the values of the standard Gibbs energy of
formation of CaSO4·2H2O, β-CaSO4·0.5H2O, and H2O(g) using polynomial
functions of the temperature; the numerical calculations were performed
by MATLAB, T represents the numerical value of Kelvin
temperature, and it was found that the results could be represented
by the following equations 4   5   6   7  

Correction of the Gibbs Free Energy of Formation of γ-CaSO4
The water molecules in the air can easily enter
into the γ-CaSO4 lattice because of its honeycomb
structure. Because of this, pure γ-CaSO4 without
a trace of crystal water is difficult to obtain. Therefore, the value
of the Gibbs free energy of formation of γ-CaSO4 tabulated
in the literature is not sufficiently accurate. To obtain exact thermodynamic
data, it is necessary to make a correction for the Gibbs free energy
of formation of γ-CaSO4. Kevin23 studied the effect of relative humidity on the number of
combined water molecules in the calcium sulfate subhydrate unit cell
at a temperature of 298 K, and the experimental result indicates that
the total number of combined water is strictly equal to 0.5 when the
relative humidity is maintained at 0.1%. Additionally, CaSO4·2H2O began to dehydrate when it was heated to 459
K under a water vapor partial pressure of 1 atm. On the basis of these
experimental results, the numerical values of the Gibbs free energy
of formation of γ-CaSO4 at 298 and 459 K can be calculated
using eq 9, obtaining
−1311.74 and −1250.19 kJ·mol–1, respectively.

The process of γ-CaSO4 transformation
into β-CaSO4·0.5H2O by absorbing
the water vapor in the air can be expressed by the following reaction 8  

To calculate the standard
Gibbs energy of formation of γ-CaSO4, we write 9  

To obtain the accurate expression
of the Gibbs free energy of formation
of γ-CaSO4 at the temperature of interest, eq 5 can be transformed into
the following form 10  where the symbol a and the
symbol b in eq 10 are the two undetermined parameters. By substituting
the values of the standard Gibbs energy of formation of γ-CaSO4 at 298 and 459 K for parameters a and b successively, a matrix equation was derived. 11  

The numerical values of parameters a and b were obtained by solving the above
matrix equation, and
the calculation reads 12  

By inserting the numerical values of a and b into eq 10, the accurate expression for the Gibbs free
energy of formation
of γ-CaSO4 was rewritten as follows 13  

Gibbs Free Energy of Formation of CaSO4·nH2O
The framework of γ-CaSO4 has a honeycomb structure;24 therefore,
γ-CaSO4 quite easily rehydrates to form calcium sulfate
subhydrate (CaSO4·nH2O) 14  

Karni argued that the number of combined
water in CaSO4·nH2O can
range from 0 to 0.67.25

The Gibbs
free energies of CaSO4·2H2O, β-CaSO4·0.5H2O, and γ-CaSO4 at different
temperatures can be calculated using eqs 4, 6 and 13, and the calculation results are tabulated
in Table 1.

The standard molar
Gibbs free energy of formation of CaSO4·nH2O is not available in literature
studies. Valero26 proposed an approximation
method and provided a mathematic expression to calculate the thermodynamic
properties of the hydrated substance, as in eq 15. 15  where  and  are the standard molar
Gibbs free energies
of formation of γ-CaSO4 and H2O, respectively;
ΔGhydr,Ao is the standard molar hydration Gibbs free
energy of CaSO4; and n is the total number
of the water molecules in the CaSO4·nH2O phase.

While the above formula is accurate and
its associated deviation
rarely exceeds ±2%, it still does not meet the requirements for
the exact thermodynamic calculation in this work. Expression (15) is only a first-order linear function of the independent
variable n, and consequently, its precision is limited.
The values presented in Table 1 indicate that the standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation
of the CaSO4·nH2O phase
depends on the two independent variables, namely, the temperature
(K) and total water content (n). This implies that
nonlinear multiple regression is suitable for evaluating the standard
molar hydration Gibbs free energy of the CaSO4·nH2O phase. Therefore, the following polynomial
for the CaSO4·nH2O phase
was employed (Figure 1) 16  where a, b, c, d, e, f, and g are all underdetermined parameters.
MATLAB was used to fit the nonlinear function, given by eq 16, to the data presented in Table 1, and the calculation
results indicate that the values of coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f, and n are −1426.73,
3.8422 × 10–1, 1.6603 × 10–6, −292.72, 2.1002 × 10–1, 1.4389 ×

−1.9774 × 10–8, respectively. Inserting
these values into eq 16 yields 17

Results and Discussion
Thermodynamic
Analysis of the Pathway of Gypsum Dehydration
Each of the
below three chemical reactions may be spontaneous when
gypsum is heated in ambient condition. However, the question of which
dehydration reaction of gypsum will occur in practice requires further
analysis of the thermodynamic calculations and the experimental results. 18   19   20  

The standard Gibbs energy for a chemical
reaction is the difference in standard molar Gibbs energies of the
products and reactants in their standard states; it is easy to obtain
the standard Gibbs energy of reaction by using the appropriate combination 21  

When a system is in equilibrium, its standard
Gibbs energy of reaction
is equal to zero, that is, 22  

Substituting eqs 22 into 21 yields 23  

By applying the above-mentioned
formula 23 to reactions 18–20 successively, we obtain 24   25   26  

By inserting
the polynomials 4, 6, 7, and 9 into eqs 24–26 separately and by simplifying the result, we obtain the following
three expressions 27   28   29  where PH2O(gypsum–hemihydrate) is the equilibrium water
vapor
pressure of the reaction for the transformation of CaSO4·2H2O into β-CaSO4·0.5H2O, PH2O(gypsum–anhydrate) represents the dissociation pressure of β-CaSO4·0.5H2O dehydrated to form γ-CaSO4, and PH2O(hemihydrate–anhydrate) naturally denotes the equilibrium water vapor pressure of the transformation
of β-CaSO4·0.5H2O into γ-CaSO4.

To show the results of thermodynamic calculations
more clearly,
expressions 27–29 are simultaneously plotted in Figure 2.

data of Kelley:27 open circles and diamond
denote the water vapor partial pressure of gypsum–hemihydrate
and hemihydrate–soluble anhydrite equilibrium, respectively.
Symbol A is the intersection of red, green, and blue curves and the
axis of ordinates, B, C, and D, are the intersections of red, green,
and blue curves and the horizontal line in Figure 2, respectively.

Three curves of the equilibrium water vapor pressure plotted
versus
the changes in temperature divide Figure 2 into four parts. It is easy to conclude
that CaSO4·2H2O is stable and does not
dehydrate to form β-CaSO4·0.5H2O
or γ-CaSO4 when the temperature and water vapor partial
pressure are located in the zone above curve AB. With the increase
of temperature, CaSO4·2H2O will partially
lose its combined water and produce β-CaSO4·0.5H2O. If the temperature and water vapor pressure increase further,
that is, if the coordinate point defined by the two values of both
the temperature and water vapor pressure is in the ACD zone, CaSO4·2H2O first dehydrates to form γ-CaSO4 and then the formed γ-CaSO4 absorbs the
water molecules in the autogenous or ambient atmosphere. Consequently,
the water molecules reenter the γ-CaSO4 framework
to generate β-CaSO4·0.5H2O. In the
region below curve AD, both β-CaSO4·0.5H2O and γ-CaSO4 are thermodynamically unfavorable;
hence, gypsum dehydrates to directly form γ-CaSO4 in a single-step process (CaSO4·2H2O
→ γ-CaSO4).

The open circles and diamond
denote the experimental water vapor
partial pressure of gypsum–hemihydrate and hemihydrate–soluble
anhydrite equilibrium, respectively. It is clear that the experimental
results agree well with the result of the thermodynamic calculations.

Thermodynamic Analysis for the Transformation of Gypsum into
the CaSO4·nH2O Phase
Over the past decades, many studies have proposed the existence
of various subhydrates with a general chemical formula of CaSO4·nH2O, where the numerical
value of n ranges from 0 to 0.67.25,28 If the dehydration product CaSO4·nH2O occurs upon the heating of gypsum, then the dehydration
reaction of gypsum can be expressed as the following reaction 30  

Considering that reaction (30) is at
equilibrium if the total difference in the
Gibbs free energy is equal to zero, that is, 31  

By inserting (4), (7), and (17) into (31),
the expression is simplified to 32  

Figure 3 shows an
overview of the effect of the temperature and water vapor pressure
on the combined water number n in the CaSO4·nH2O phase formed by the dehydration
of gypsum. In the higher relative humidity and lower temperature zone,
the thermodynamic calculation results favor the occurrence of the
CaSO4·nH2O (n > 0.5) phase and the combined water number n can
approach its maximum of 0.67 because of the effect of the steric hindrances
associated with the H2O–H2O bond distance
in the channel of the γ-CaSO4 lattice.29 In fact, the occurrence of the CaSO4·0.67H2O phase has been confirmed by the in situ
XRD, and the initial dehydration product of gypsum was the CaSO4·0.67H2O phase.1

Surfaces of the equilibrium water vapor pressure calculated
by eq 29 and of the
saturated vapor pressure of water. (b) Projections of the intersection
of different relative humidity water vapor surfaces and the equilibrium
water vapor surface obtained from eq 32.

If the ambient temperature
is low and the relative humidity is
high, gypsum is stable and does not decompose to form any calcium
sulfate hemihydrate. Furthermore, gypsum is thermodynamically unstable
when the ambient temperature and relative humidity are high.

MC Simulation
of Adsorption Water Vapor in the γ-CaSO4 Lattice
The γ-CaSO4 lattice consists
of Ca2+ ions and a SO42– tetrahedron,
and the alternating Ca2+ and SO42– ions in chains −Ca–SO4–Ca–SO4– form straight chains running along the
[001] direction30,31 such that these chains present
a periodic arrangement and show a honeycomb structure. The faveolate
voids appear to give the γ-CaSO4 framework the ability
to absorb water molecules from the air, forming a CaSO4·nH2O phase. In fact, the study
of the adsorption phenomenon has a significant benefit for the manufacturing
of plaster of paris and for obtaining the water vapor content in very
dry areas, such as the desert or even Mars (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Projection of the γ-CaSO4 lattice along the [001]
vector, illustrating that the channels consist of six chains of alternating
Ca2+ and SO42– perpendicular
to the plane of the paper.

Figure 5 shows
the
adsorption isotherms of water in the γ-CaSO4 framework,
along with the experimental data. It is clear that the MC simulation
calculations agree well with the experimental results;28,29 therefore, the relevant parameter setting employed in the simulation
calculation processes is a suitable and powerful tool for investigating
and predicting the adsorption isotherms of water vapor on the γ-CaSO4 lattice at different ambient temperatures and relative humidities,
especially in a very low temperature and humidity environment that
is very difficult to be achieved in the laboratory.

to 100 RH % derived from Rietveld refinements1 and simulation at 298 K. (b) Density maps for
water vapor molecules in a γ-CaSO4 framework.

The experimental and calculated
results presented in Figures 5 and 6 indicated that γ-CaSO4 has an excellent ability
to adsorb water vapor at fairly low relative humidities in the temperature
range of 215–298 K. γ-CaSO4 can rehydrate
to form CaSO4·0.5H2O by adsorbing water
vapor from the air when the relative humidity is as low as approximately
1% at 298 K; however, the number of combined water in the γ-CaSO4 lattice approaches 0.67 when the relative humidity is more
than 80% at 298 K. Additionally, the MC simulation results also reveal
the conformation of the water molecules distributed in the channel
of the γ-CaSO4 framework.

Figure 6 Cumulative H2O occupancy for the CaSO4·nH2O (0 < n < 0.67) phase
from 0 to 0.07 kPa derived from the simulation at 215 K.

It is obvious that γ-CaSO4 has
a strong adsorption
ability under low water vapor pressure and at low temperature, although
the amount of water adsorbed of γ-CaSO4 is less than
MOF-801 (a porous metal–organic framework, Zr6O4(OH)4 (fumarate)6).32 With further decreases in the ambient temperature, γ-CaSO4 can still capture 0.5 combined water molecules per CaSO4 unit cell at about 0.04 Pa water vapor pressure and 215 K;
these numbers show clearly that it may be utilized to harvest water
from the extremely dry Martian atmosphere. Because the water vapor
mixing ratio and atmospheric pressure on the surface of Mars are circa
600 ppm33 and 610 Pa, respectively,34 it is easy to draw the conclusion that the water
vapor pressure on the Martian surface is approximately equal to 0.366
Pa. The MC simulation result (Figure 6) indicates that γ-CaSO4 has the ability
to absorb water molecules to form CaSO4·nH2O phases from the extremely dry Martian atmosphere;
the numerical value of crystal water n increases
from 0 to 0.5 when the water vapor pressure ranges from 0 to 0.04
Pa at the average surface temperature of 215 K on Mars. Obviously,
the water vapor pressure on Mars is far higher than the equilibrium
water vapor pressure for γ-CaSO4 rehydration to transform
CaSO4·0.5H2O. Thus, γ-CaSO4 has a great potential to be used as a key material to indigenously
obtain water on Mars. Additionally, the structures of γ-CaSO4 and CaSO4·0.5H2O are highly similar
as both crystal lattices provide honeycomb channels of 0.4 nm diameter.35,36 As a result, the faveolate framework of γ-CaSO4 can remain almost unchanged throughout many cycles of the dehydration
and water absorption processes of γ-CaSO4.

Conclusions
In this work, the dehydration pathways of gypsum and the rehydration
mechanism of soluble anhydrite were mainly investigated by thermodynamic
modeling and MC simulations. The dehydration pathways of gypsum are
largely determined by ambient temperature and water vapor pressure.
In the low-temperature and high water vapor zone above curve AB in Figure 2, gypsum is thermodynamically
stable; in the ABC zone, CaSO4·2H2O will
partially dehydrate its crystal water to form β-CaSO4·0.5H2O, and as the temperature is increased, gypsum
undergoes a two-step dehydration process (CaSO4·2H2O → γ-CaSO4 → β-CaSO4·0.5H2O). In the region below curve AD, both
β-CaSO4·0.5H2O and γ-CaSO4 are all thermodynamically unfavorable; therefore, gypsum
dehydrates to directly form γ-CaSO4 in a single-step
process (CaSO4·2H2O → γ-CaSO4). Additionally, in the processes of gypsum dehydration and
γ-CaSO4 rehydration, the maximum n, which is the number of crystal water of the formed CaSO4·nH2O, approaches 0.67; furthermore,
MC simulations have successfully predicted the occupation of water
molecules in the γ-CaSO4 framework.

γ-CaSO4 has an extraordinary ability to capture
water molecules from extremely dry atmosphere, endowing γ-CaSO4 a great potential to become a key material used to extract
liquid water from very dry air. Moreover, it could also be used to
industrial drying processes at room temperature in many fields because
of its remarkable ability to absorb water vapor.
