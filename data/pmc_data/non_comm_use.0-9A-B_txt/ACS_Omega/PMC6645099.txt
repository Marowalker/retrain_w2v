Design, synthesis, and application
of cyclodextrin (CD) containing
thermoresponsive hydrogels fabricated from thiol-reactive telechelic
polymers are reported. Hydrophilic polymers containing 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate and/or di(ethylene glycol)methylether methacrylate monomers
as side chains and thiol-reactive groups at chain ends were synthesized.
A series of hydrogels was fabricated using thiol–ene conjugation
of these thiol-reactive polymers with multivalent thiol-containing
CDs as crosslinkers. Clear and transparent hydrogels were obtained
with good conversion (79–89%) by utilizing the “nucleophilic”
and “radical” thiol–ene “click”
reactions. Analysis of the amount of residual thiol groups in these
hydrogels using Ellman’s reagent suggested that gels with a
moderately well-defined network structure were obtained. Hydrogels
fabricated using different telechelic polymers were examined for their
properties such as morphology, equilibrium water uptake, and rheological
characteristics. Cytocompatibility of these hydrogels was ascertained
by a cell viability assay that demonstrated low toxicity toward fibroblast
cells. Thereafter, the CD-containing hydrogels were evaluated for
the loading and controlled release of puerarin, an antiglaucoma drug.
Utilization of thermoresponsive polymers as the matrix for these hydrogels
allows use of temperature as a stimulus to modulate the drug release.
A slower and more sustained drug release was observed at physiological
temperatures compared to ambient conditions. The effect of temperature
on the elasticity of the hydrogel was investigated rheologically to
demonstrate that the collapse of the network structure occurs near
physiological temperatures. The increased hydrophobicity and compactness
of the gel matrix at higher temperatures results in a slower drug
release. The strategy employed here demonstrates that tuning the matrix
composition of hydrogels with well-defined network structures through
appropriate choice of responsive copolymers allows design of materials
with control of their physical properties and drug-release behavior.

Introduction
Cross-linked hydrophilic
polymeric networks, often referred to
as hydrogels, have drawn widespread interest in recent years as potential
candidates for applications in areas such as fabrication of drug-release
devices, tissue engineering scaffolds, implant materials, and bioimmobilization
platforms.1−11 Over the past decade, a variety of different synthetic strategies
have been employed for the preparation of hydrogels. Besides the synthesis
of covalently cross-linked hydrogels via free-radical cross-linking
of hydrophilic polymerizable units, various “click chemistry”-based
methodologies including thiol–ene, azide–alkyne cycloaddition,
and Diels–Alder reactions were effectively utilized in cross-linking
of monomers and polymers.12−16 Along with the development of efficient cross-linking strategies,
an important concept that has evolved in recent years relates to their
synthesis with a well-defined network structure. Such structurally
well-defined hydrogels are obtained when efficient network formation
is accurately controlled by using building blocks containing precisely
positioned cross-linking points.17−19 Hydrogels with a near-ideal
network structure enable fabrication of materials with a well-defined
structure–property relationship.20 Near-ideal network structure hydrogels imply that polymer chain
connectivity is homogenous throughout the gel. This is in contrast
to hydrogels where cross-linking between polymeric chains is random,
for example, often encountered in photopolymerized hydrogels. A simple
approach to obtain near-well-defined network materials involves effective
cross-linking of polymers bearing reactive groups at their chain ends,
with multivalent cross-linkers. Polymers bearing reactive functional
groups at their chain ends are referred to as telechelics and are
important functional macromolecules widely used as building blocks,
cross-linkers, and chain extenders.21−24 Telechelic polymers with precise
end-group reactive functionalities provide ideal building blocks for
fabrication of well-defined network structures.

Utilization
of hydrogels in drug delivery is widespread, and it
is well-established that the release of drugs can be controlled by
varying the chemical and physical properties of these materials.25−27 Depending on the drug and the intended application, the loading
and release of the drug can be tuned using electrostatic and/or hydrophobic
interactions with the hydrogel matrix. While most hydrophobic interactions
are nonspecific, utilization of precise building blocks like cyclodextrins
(CDs) provide an element of control because the interaction of the
guest molecules depends on the size of the CD cavity. It has been
demonstrated that β-CD, along with other CDs, has a remarkable
ability of forming inclusion complexes with hydrophobic molecules.28−30 Because of this unique behavior, β-CD and its derivatives
have been extensively investigated in the design of sustained drug
delivery systems.31−34 The multivalent construct of β-CD also allows its use as a
cross-linking agent for obtaining hydrogels, and several hydrogels
have been prepared using this approach.35,36 In a recent
study, Shih et al. utilized the multivalent thiol- and alkene-functionalized
β-CDs for fabrication of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels
in applications of drug delivery and cell encapsulation. The approach
was to modify the CD hydroxyl groups with various degrees of substitution
that the resulting CD derivatives enable the tuning of gelation kinetics
and gel properties.37 Several significant
studies combine the molecular recognition abilities of CDs with temperature-responsive
polymers to fabricate responsive hydrogels.38−40 However, importantly,
none of these reports utilizes a strategy that would yield near-well-defined
hydrogel structures, so the CDs are located in a heterogeneous environment
instead of a homogenous one. This usually arises from employing CD
building blocks where the number of reactive units is not precisely
controlled. In addition to this, current CD-based hydrogel platforms
utilize mostly N-isopropylacrylamide and related
monomers as temperature-responsive units. New materials employing
di(ethylene glycol)methylether methacrylate (DEGMA) and other PEG-based
building blocks as temperature-responsive handles may provide a wider
perspective of the material design by exploiting their important features,
such as high biocompatibility and antibiofouling nature. Envisaging
materials which combine discrete well-defined building blocks to produce
well-defined network structures will enable rational improvement and
tunability of such materials.

We recently reported the fabrication
of CD-containing hydrogels
with well-defined network structures.41,42 Hydrogels
were synthesized using nucleophilic and radical thiol–ene “click”
reactions by utilizing the telechelic linear PEG-based polymers. Although
the study demonstrated that multivalent CDs act as a versatile cross-linker,
the utilization of linear PEGs can only allow tailoring of the properties
of these hydrogels to a certain extent, and it lacks stimuli-responsiveness.
To expand the properties of these materials to include aspects such
as stimuli-responsiveness, the methodology should be adaptable to
polymers other than linear PEGs. It is well-established that PEG-based
graft polymers containing oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains exhibit
lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in aqueous solution, and
this behavior of DEGMA-containing copolymers has been exploited to
obtain thermoresponsive hydrogel materials.43−48

Herein, we report the fabrication of CD-containing thermoresponsive
hydrogels with near-well-defined network structures by employing copolymers
containing PEG-based side chains. Thiol–ene click reactions
between homotelechelic maleimide and vinyl group-functionalized (co)polymers
with a heptathiol-functionalized β-CD crosslinker were utilized
(Scheme 1). Efficient
reactions between maleimide and vinyl groups with thiols through the
nucleophilic and radical thiol–ene reactions, respectively,
provided hydrogels with good yields. By varying the composition of
the polymers, characteristics such as their water uptake capacity,
surface morphologies, and rheological behaviors can be tuned. Importantly,
utilization of thermoresponsive copolymers provides a handle for varying
the properties of these hydrogels as a response to temperature. Temperature-responsive
modulation of drug release from these CD-containing hydrogels was
evaluated using puerarin, a poorly water-soluble drug employed in
treatment of glaucoma. It can be envisioned that the reported hydrogels
with discrete CD units and a temperature-responsive polymer matrix
can be of potential interest in drug delivery devices such as soft
contact lenses. The demonstrated UV-initiated curing of hydrogels,
as well as catalyst-free thiol–maleimide addition can also
enable fabrication of injectable hydrogels for tissue engineering
and regenerative medicine.

Addition Reactions and Their Drug-Loaded States
Results and Discussion
Telechelic
polymers with thiol-reactive end groups and 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (HEMA)/DEGMA side chain groups were evaluated in the
fabrication of CD-containing stimuli-responsive hydrogel networks
(Scheme 2). Bismaleimide
and bisvinyl end-functional polymers (P-BMs and P-BVs, Scheme 2) were obtained by utilization
of reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)
polymerization, with subsequent postpolymerization modification (synthetic
details provided in Supporting Information). Chain transfer agents carrying furan-protected maleimide and vinyl
groups were used in the polymerization of HEMA and DEGMA monomers
(Scheme S1 and Figures S1–S6). Analyses of these polymers using proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and size exclusion chromatography
revealed that polymers were obtained with good control over molecular
weight and relatively narrow distributions (Table S1 and Figure S7). Subsequently,
radical-induced cross-coupling reactions with functionalized azo-initiators
were performed to introduce thiol-reactive functional groups to the
polymer chain ends. The dithiobenzoate end groups of the copolymers
were replaced with reactive maleimide or unactivated alkene moieties
by using 20-fold excess of appropriately functionalized azo compounds
per chain end group to provide cross-coupling products in a quantitative
manner. After extensive purification of the modified polymers to remove
the small molecule impurities, successful end-group transformation
was established by 1H NMR analysis (Figures S8 and S9).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Thermoresponsive Hydrogels
via Thiol–Ene Addition
Reactions
Hydrogels were prepared
via thiol–ene reactions of bisalkene-functionalized
(co)polymers with a heptavalent thiol-functionalized β-CD cross-linker
(β-CD(SH)7). Relatively small molecular weight polymers
were chosen to promote high coupling efficiency during gelation. Hydrogels
via nucleophilic thiol–ene reactions were obtained by combining
the solutions of maleimide-functionalized homotelechelic polymers
and β-CD(SH)7. Through multiple Michael additions
of thiol groups onto maleimides, rapid cross-linking occurs, and in
approximately 1 min, no flow of sample was observed. To ensure complete
network formation, gelation was continued for 12 h. As expected for
the nucleophilic thiol–maleimide reaction, it was observed
that gelation was promoted in the presence of a catalytic amount of
Et3N. For the bisvinyl-functionalized RAFT polymers, hydrogels
were obtained via UV-induced thiol–ene reaction of vinyl functionalities
with thiol groups of the cross-linker β-CD(SH)7.
The reactions were conducted under UV light (365 nm) in the presence
of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA) as a photoinitiator.
To compare the effect of side chain groups on the physical and morphological
properties, a library of hydrogels was prepared using HEMA-/DEGMA-based
homopolymers and copolymers. The nomenclature indicating composition
of polymers and hydrogels utilized is as follows: P-BM-D refers to
polymer (P)-containing bismaleimide (BM) and DEGMA (D), whereas H-CM-D
suggests hydrogel (H) obtained from conjugation of CD with a maleimide
polymer (CM) composed of DEGMA. The abbreviation HD refers to polymers
and hydrogels with an equimolar amount of HEMA and DEGMA. Table 1 summarizes the compositions,
feed ratios, and gel conversions of thus obtained hydrogels.

Thiol–maleimide Michael addition and radical thiol–ene
reactions have been widely employed to synthesize and functionalize
polymeric materials because the reactions proceed with high conversions
under metal-free conditions.49−54 Polymers with maleimide or alkene end functionalities were reacted
with a β-CD(SH)7 cross-linker through nucleophilic
and radical thiol–ene reactions to prepare hydrogels H-CMs
and H-CVs (Table 1,
entry 1–6). HEMA-/DEGMA-based polymers with similar molecular
weights were used in gel fabrication. In each case, the amount of
cross-linker and polymer was adjusted to obtain molar-equivalence
coupling of alkene and thiol functionality. In ideal circumstances,
it can be assumed that complete pairing of maleimide or vinyl groups
with thiols would render well-defined network structures. On the other
hand, the steric bulk of polymer chains, chain entanglements, loop
formations, steric crowding, and undesirable side reactions at cross-linking
nodes will compromise the ideal network formation. Hydrogels were
obtained with good gel conversions, yet attempts of further increase
in yields were unsuccessful, and this was attributed to abovementioned
reasons. In general, slightly higher gel conversions were obtained
for the hydrogels prepared by thiol–maleimide conjugation.

To gather further information about the cross-linking efficiency
of the processes, residual thiol content in hydrogels were obtained
via Ellman’s thiol analysis. Hydrogels prepared using various
telechelic polymers were reacted with 5,5-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic
acid (DTNB, Ellman’s reagent), and the resulting 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic
acid (TNB) fragment were quantified spectrophotometrically. To keep
the disulfide formation minimal, hydrogels were analyzed directly
after their preparation. The values of the amount of thiol used and
the percent thiol consumed in hydrogel formation are reported in Table 1. According to the
results, thiol consumptions proceeded with efficiencies between 80
and 90%, and a slightly higher conversion was observed for the hydrogels
obtained using thiol–maleimide addition. The most likely reason
for nonquantitative thiol consumption is the high steric crowding
around the heptavalent cross-linker that diminishes the efficient
coupling of complementary groups. Thus, to test the effect of cross-linker
functional group crowding on conjugation efficiency of maleimide and
vinyl groups with thiols, a series of hydrogels were synthesized using
tetra-thiol-functionalized cross-linker and analyzed for thiol-group
consumption (Figure S10). Hydrogels synthesized
by using P-BM-H and P-BV-H polymers with a sterically noncrowded tetra-thiol-functionalized
cross-linker pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) resulted
in higher gel conversions (97 and 91%, respectively) as well as increased
thiol consumptions (91.6 and 86.3%, respectively, Table S2, Supporting Information), which suggests the effect
of steric crowding at the cross-linking points on conjugation efficiency.

The hydrogels obtained using nucleophilic and radical thiol–ene
reactions were clear and transparent in their wet state. On the basis
of the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) analysis
of freeze-dried hydrogels, continuous gel structures with low porosities
were observed for DEGMA-based hydrogels (Figure 1). Notably, for both of the hydrogel series
prepared by bismaleimide- and bisvinyl-functionalized polymers, relatively
higher porous structures were observed for HEMA-based gel networks.
Hydrogels were investigated in terms of their swelling behaviors by
monitoring their water uptake with time until a constant weight was
reached. All hydrogels showed high swelling capacity and fast swelling
kinetics because of hydrophilic side chains (Figure 2). Higher swelling was obtained with HEMA-based
hydrogels, which can be attributed to the higher hydrophilic character
of the HEMA monomer.

The viscoelastic gel properties were examined via
dynamic frequency
scan analysis of samples at equilibrium swelling. The measurements
revealed that the storage and loss moduli of networks exhibit low
oscillation frequency dependence suggesting the viscoelastic gel behavior
(Figure 3).55 The storage (G′) and
loss (G″) moduli values ranged from 101 to 104 Pa, and for the all samples tested, the
storage modulus was found to be greater than loss modulus which is
a distinguishing rheological property of elastic solid materials.
It was observed that the feed of DEGMA in hydrogel composition affects
the rheological properties, as stronger viscoelastic materials were
obtained upon increasing the DEGMA content.

The potential applications of hydrogels are mostly related
to the
composition of the network structure, whereby the structural and chemical
compositions of the hydrogel define their physical and chemical characteristics.
To further demonstrate the utility of the polymeric building blocks
chosen in this study, hydrogels obtained from HEMA- and DEGMA-based
hydrophilic polymers were evaluated as temperature-responsive materials.
Hydrogels undergoing conformational changes in response to changing
stimulus (i.e., temperature, pH, and magnetic field) have been extensively
investigated as important materials in drug delivery.56 These materials are often referred as intelligent/smart
hydrogels because they respond to physical or chemical stimuli by
phase transition or volume collapse. Especially, changes in swelling/deswelling
kinetics allow the controlled release of cargo entities. Temperature-responsive
hydrogels are by far the most extensively studied materials as smart
delivery platforms. Among the widely employed and most extensively
studied polymers for the preparation of stimuli-responsive drug delivery
platforms are poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-based
systems that exhibit thermally reversible phase changes above ∼32
°C. Far less studied polymers based on oligoethylene glycol groups
that possess an LCST of ∼26 °C and above, depending on
the number of ethylene glycol groups, might provide a convenient tool
to control the temperature responsiveness over a wider temperature
range. The presence of diethylene glycol side chains leads to a thermoresponsive
behavior because such polymers possess an LCST of ∼26 °C.57,58 Thus, in this study, the hydrogel H-CV-D, prepared from a bisvinyl-functionalized
DEGMA homopolymer was investigated in terms of temperature-responsive
gel properties. According to the turbidimetry measurements of H-CV-D,
a transition temperature near 28 °C was observed when monitoring
the loss of transmittance with increasing temperature (Figure 4). The sample displayed a reversible
phase transition as a transparent gel was obtained upon cooling. The
variation of the swelling ratio of the hydrogel below and above the
LCST temperature (25 and 35 °C) also indicated the tunability
of the gel behavior. Above the LCST, the equilibrium water uptake
capacities of these gels were appreciably reduced (Figure 5). Rheological studies performed
at temperatures below and above the LCST revealed increased storage
modulus (G′) values at higher temperatures
(Figure 6). Such a
behavior can be expected based on the collapsed network structure
due to loss of hydration of polymer chains. As expected, the change
in transparency, water uptake, and rheological studies performed using
a bisvinyl-functionalized HEMA polymer demonstrated no significant
temperature responsive behavior (Figures 4–6).

nature of hydrogels monitored by heating the swollen
gel. Transition temperature was measured by monitoring the change
of transmittance upon heating.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of nucleophilic and radical thiol–ene
hydrogels was evaluated on L929 fibroblast cell line using CCK-8 cell
viability assay (Figure 7). The results demonstrate no significant cytotoxicity in case of
both types of hydrogels, and thus suggest that the biocompatibility
of the fabricated materials makes them suitable for various biomedical
applications.

Release of therapeutically relevant
materials such as drugs and
biomolecules from hydrogels holds immense potential to realize pragmatic
administration systems. Most of the strategies to load and release
drugs from noneroding hydrogels are based on the diffusion of encapsulated
drug molecules into and out of the network. Thus, the matrix composition
plays a very important role. The drug uptake and release properties
of obtained hydrogels were studied using a poorly water-soluble drug,
puerarin, a traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of
glaucoma (solubility as 0.011 M at 25 °C).59 It is been established that β-CD can form inclusion
complexation with puerarin, and the stability constant of the inclusion
complex between puerarin and β-CD is 266.26 M–1.60 Hydrogels prepared from HEMA-/DEGMA-based
polymers and β-CD(SH)7 were loaded by puerarin using
the solution absorption method. Hydrogel disks swollen in water were
soaked in drug solution (0.80 mg/mL), and the drug loading was checked
spectrophotometrically until it reached equilibrium, usually after
incubating for a period of 24 h (Table 1). Hydrogel drug loading capacities were found to be
dependent on the nature of the copolymer used. For all hydrogels,
increasing the HEMA content caused an increase in drug loading. This
result could be attributed to the fact that the highly hydrophilic
nature of the HEMA-based matrix allows better diffusion of the drug
into the hydrogel. For the release studies, hydrogels loaded with
puerarin were gently rinsed with distilled water and placed in a release
medium. To mimic sink conditions, the drug-released solution was switched
with a fresh one after regular time intervals. The drug release was
monitored by collecting the release samples and analyzing via UV spectroscopy.
As shown in Figure 8, all hydrogels exhibited an initial burst release which could be
ascribed to the removal of the free drug near the surface of the hydrogel.61 An increase in the amount of burst release was
observed for hydrogels with a higher HEMA content, while all DEGMA-based
hydrogels showed a lower initial burst and more sustained release.
Among the hydrogel series prepared by nucleophilic and radical thiol–ene
reactions, radical thiol–ene-based hydrogels exhibited a relatively
low initial burst and a more sustained release. This discrepancy may
originate from the more compact network structure of UV-fabricated
gels, as well as the difference in polarity of chemical composition
at cross-linking points because these gels also exhibited lower water
retention. The cumulative release of puerarin from CD-incorporated
hydrogels and release profiles are comparable with other systems reported
in literature and may be altered by using different concentrations
of puerarin in the soaking solution.62

Figure 8 Cumulative
release of puerarin from hydrogels (a) H-CMs and (b)
H-CVs.

The temperature-dependent release
studies of the drug from hydrogels
demonstrated stimuli-responsive modulation of release profiles. The
release of the drug from DEGMA-based hydrogel (H-CV-D) decreased upon
increasing the temperature from 25 to 37 °C (Figure 9a). The lower initial burst
release above LCST was attributed to the entrapment of the drug molecules
within the collapsed hydrogel matrix. However, as expected, for the
HEMA-based hydrogel (H-CV-H), a higher initial burst release was observed,
as temperature was increased from 25 to 37 °C (Figure 9b). These results demonstrate
the judicious choice of synthetic polymers as the hydrogel matrix
to obtain near-well-defined structured materials which can provide
responsive materials with tunable properties.

Conclusions
Utilization
of telechelic polymers in the fabrication of β-CD-containing
hydrogels was demonstrated. HEMA- and/or di(ethylene glycol) methyl
ether methacrylate (DEGMA)-based hydrophilic polymers were synthesized
using RAFT polymerization. Thiol-reactive maleimide and vinyl functional
groups were placed at polymer end groups by using a functional group
containing chain transfer agents and postpolymerization modification
of existing polymers. The end-group functional polymers were utilized
in hydrogel fabrication. Obtained hydrogels comprising different polymers
were characterized in terms of properties like equilibrium water uptake,
rheological behavior, and morphology. These β-CD-containing
hydrogels have been tested on drug sorption and controlled release
by employing an antiglaucoma drug puerarin. According to the release
studies, radical thiol–ene-based hydrogels exhibited a relatively
lower initial burst and more sustained release on puerarin instance.
In addition, temperature-responsive release profiles were observed
in the DEGMA-based network. It can be envisioned that the methodology
outlined here can be extended to obtain near-well-defined CD-containing
hydrogels that would be responsive toward other physical, chemical,
or biological triggers through judicious choice of the polymeric building
blocks.

Experimental Section
Materials and Characterization
All
chemicals used were
of reagent grade (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) and were used as received.
The solvents were obtained from Merck Co. (Germany) and used as received.
The detailed synthesis of thiol-reactive telechelic polymers is described
in Supporting Information. Synthesis of
β-CD thiol (β-CD(SH)7) was undertaken according
to reported literature.63 The puerarin
used was supplied by TCI Chemicals (Japan). Thiol–ene reactions
of hydrogel synthesis were performed at 365 nm using a handheld UV
lamp (Blak-Ray UVP model B-100AP/R high intensity UV lamp with a 100
W spot bulb and 7° beam width). Morphologies of dried gels were
investigated without sputtering with an ESEM XL-30 (Philips, Eindhoven,
The Netherlands) SEM operating under high vacuum, with a 10 kV accelerating
voltage at a working distance around 10 mm. The rheological behaviors
of hydrogel samples were characterized in terms of loss (G″) and storage (G′) moduli of hydrogel
samples equilibrated in water by measuring the angular frequency dependence
of modulus values. Measurements were conducted out at 25 °C using
0.5% strain between 0.05 and 100 rad/s using an Anton Paar MCR 302
rheometer. A parallel plate of 8 mm diameter was used for analysis
and a gap of 2.0 mm between plates was used. During measurements,
a solvent trap was used to reduce solvent evaporation.

Representative
Hydrogel Formation via Nucleophilic Thiol–Ene
Reaction
Hydrogels were obtained through multiple thiol–ene
reactions between maleimide groups of polymers and β-CD(SH)7. For a representative example, the bismaleimide-functionalized
polymer P-BM-HD (50.0 mg, 14.0 × 10–3 mmol)
was added to a vial containing dimethylformamide (DMF) (100 μL).
A solution of β-CD(SH)7 (5.0 mg, 4.0 × 10–3 mmol) and triethylamine (0.39 μL, 2.8 ×
10–3 mmol) in DMF (100 μL) was then added
to this solution. To achieve homogenous gelation, the mixture was
sonicated briefly. In about 1 min, no flow of sample was observed.
To ensure complete conjugation, gelation was continued for 12 h. After
gelation, unreacted reagents were removed by washing the gel with
DMF followed by distilled water several times. The gel sample was
frozen and lyophilized to yield a dried sample.

Representative
Hydrogel Formation via Radical Thiol–Ene
Reaction
Hydrogel synthesis was accomplished through multiple
thiol–ene reactions between vinyl groups of telechelic polymers
and thiol groups of β-CD(SH)7. The bisvinyl-functionalized
polymer P-BV-HD (50.0 mg, 0.013 mmol) was placed in a vial and dissolved
in DMF (100 μL). A mixture of β-CD(SH)7 (4.72
mg, 3.8 × 10–3 mmol) and DMPA (0.2 equiv per
thiols) in DMF (100 μL) was then added and irradiated with UV
light for 30 min at 365 nm. After gelation, residual chemicals were
removed by rinsing the gel with DMF and distilled water several times.
The dried gel was obtained by freeze-drying.

Determination of Thiol
Content
The total thiol amount
left in the gels were obtained using Ellman’s sulfhydryl assay.64 After reacting free thiol groups of hydrogels
with DTNB, they were obtained with reference to the extinction coefficient
of TNB2– species. The experimental procedure is
briefly as follows: 0.1 M sodium phosphate, containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (1 mM, pH 8.0) buffer was prepared as a reaction medium. A solution
of Ellman’s reagent was obtained using DTNB (4 mg) in 1 mL
of reaction buffer. A fresh hydrogel sample (5 mg) was placed in a
vial and 2.5 mL of reaction buffer and Ellman’s reagent solution
was added onto the sample. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C,
the total thiol content was calculated by measuring the absorbance
at 412 nm and using the extinction coefficient of TNB2– species (14 150 M–1 cm–1).65

Swelling Studies
A cylindrical sample of a hydrogel
with a size of ∼1 cm in diameter and ∼0.2 cm in height
was placed in a vial of deionized water, and the change in mass of
the sample was measured at different times till the hydrogel reached
constant weight. The percentage change in weight was calculated using
the equation 1  where Wwet and Wdry refer to the wet and dry hydrogel weights,
respectively. The swelling curves were plotted by taking the average
of three measurements.

Loading and Release of Drug
Loading
of drug into the
gels was accomplished by the solution absorption method. Gel samples
(∼50 mg) were incubated in a puerarin-containing aqueous solution
(25 mL 0.80 mg/mL) with gentle stirring at 100 rpm. Change in the
puerarin concentration in the solution was analyzed using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer at 250 nm until a constant concentration was achieved
(usually about 24 h). The drug loading amount was determined from
the difference between the initial and the final concentration of
the drug in the incubation medium. The percent drug loading was calculated
as 2  where Wdrug and Whydrogel refer to the weight of the drug and
the weight of the hydrogel sample, respectively.

The drug loaded
hydrogels were rinsed with distilled water (2 mL) and then immersed
in distilled water (15 mL) as the release medium. The release tests
were carried out at 37 °C by shaking the medium at 100 rpm. The
release medium (5 mL) was sampled at predetermined time intervals
and replaced with the same volume. The amount of the drug in the collected
media was determined using UV–vis spectroscopy. The results
were expressed in terms of cumulative release as a function of time.

Cytotoxicity Experiments
Cytotoxic activity of the
hydrogels was tested using the L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. Cells
were seeded in a 96-well plate, 100 μL of appropriate culture
medium at a density of 5000 cells/well, and incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. Cell-adhered plates were treated with hydrogels H-CM-HD
and H-CV-HD (5 mg) at 37 °C for 48 h. After the incubation, sample
solutions were removed, and wells were washed twice with PBS (100
μL). Cell viability was determined by using CCK-8 assay. By
adding CCK-8 (10%) to every well (total 70 μL) and incubation
for 4 h, absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader.
These experiments were repeated three times.
