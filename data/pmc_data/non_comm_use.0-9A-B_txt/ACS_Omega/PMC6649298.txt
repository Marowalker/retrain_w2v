Controlled
dielectric breakdown (CDB) of silicon nitride thin films
immersed in electrolyte solution has been used to fabricate single
nanofluidic channels with ∼10 nm and smaller diameters, nanopores,
useful in single-molecule sensing and ionic circuit construction.
A hand-held Tesla-coil lighter was used to form nanofluidic ionic
conductors through a ∼10 nm thick silicon nitride membrane.
Modifications to the conventional approach were required by the low-overhead
Tesla-coil-assisted method (TCAM): increased circuit resistance by including
water in place of electrolyte and discrete rather than continuous
voltage applications. The resulting ionic conductance could be tuned
with the number of voltage applications. TCAM and conventional CDB
produced nanopores with different conductance versus pH curves, suggesting
different surface chemistry. Nevertheless, sensing experiments using
the canonical test molecule, λ-DNA, produced signals comparable
to translocation results through solid-state nanopores fabricated
by other methods. Thus, the TCAM method offers flexibility in fabrication
and in the properties and function of the nanoscale ionic conductors
that it can generate.

Introduction
Nanopores have enjoyed decades of use
and ongoing development as
a platform for single-molecule sensing, with a strong focus on applications
such as DNA sequencing but including other analytes and fundamental
biophysical investigations.1−8 The most frequent experimental configuration relies on resistive-pulse
sensing and has been referred to as a molecular-scale version of Coulter
counting: analytes are electrophoretically passed through a <100
nm diameter, <100 nm long nanochannel, a nanopore, immersed in
electrolyte solution, and analyte presence is revealed when it induces
a measurable change in the nanopore conductance. The frequency of
this occurrence is proportional to analyte concentration. More broadly,
the nanopore can be thought of structurally as a nanoscale aperture
or nanofluidic channel and functionally as an ionic circuit component.9−17 The rich application possibilities have inspired considerable effort
in nanopore technology development to bring them to fruition. Thin-film
silicon nitride (low-pressure chemical vapor deposition silicon nitride,
SiNx) is a popular choice of material
because it is robust, widely used, and can withstand a range of chemical
and mechanical treatments. Although SiNx is a standard nanofabrication material,11,18 the small dimensions of the nanopores can nevertheless present considerable
challenges to fabrication. SiNx nanopore
fabrication efforts have largely depended upon the use of expensive
and operationally demanding instrumentation such as transmission and
(wet) scanning electron microscopes, helium ion microscopes, and large-scale
accelerator facilities.5,12,19−25 Recently, controlled dielectric breakdown (CDB) was developed as
a new nanopore fabrication method, free of the barriers associated
with methods relying on complex and costly instrumentation and large-scale
facilities.26−28 Application of a high field strength, typically ≤1
V/nm across a solution-immersed membrane (with solution on each side
isolated from the other side by the membrane) yields a nanopore, with
a number of operational benefits and monitoring possibilities emerging
from this fabrication method and configuration.26−29 We were inspired by this successful
effort,27,28 and by the barriers to adoption of even
such an elegant fabrication method that might emerge in the wide range
of applications for nanopores, to ask if one could even more easily
fabricate a nanopore, preferably “by hand” and with
the push of a button. Our hypothesis was that we could, with sufficient
consideration, use the Tesla-coil lighter as an exceptionally low-barrier
tool to form nanopores in free-standing silicon nitride membranes.

Nanopore conductance analysis is a well-benchmarked method to approximate
nanopore size and profile nanopore surface chemistry, and it directly
characterizes a nanopore as an ionic circuit element.26,29−33 The method additionally complements the fabrication method by also
being low overhead so that instrumentation eliminated from the fabrication
workflow need not be reintroduced during characterization. In brief,
a nanopore in electrolyte solution can be thought of as an ionic conductor,
with its conductance determined by its dimensions and surface chemistry
for a given solution composition. For a cylindrical nanopore of radius r0 and total length L (here
the length of the nanopore is taken to be equal to the SiNx membrane thickness), the total nanopore conductance
can be approximated as26,29−34 1  where K is the solution conductivity,
σ is the nanopore surface charge density, μ is the surface
counterion mobility, and α and β are model-dependent parameters
both set to 2 as in earlier work.35 With
known solution and surface parameter values, measurements of the conductance
can be used to uncover effective nanopore sizes, r0. Nanopores with ionizable surface species have σ
= σ(pH) so that G can be tuned by pH (independent
of geometrical parameters, here r0 and L), and the resulting dG/dpH can yield
insight into nanopore surface chemistry. To illustrate, it is conventional,
in most instances, to treat the surface charge density of amphoteric
SiNx nanopores as being governed by the
monoprotic equilibrium 2  that would have  when protonated in sufficiently acidic
solutions, and  when deprotonating
in sufficiently basic
solutions. The change in total conductance, with fixed K and r0 but changing pH, arises from
the surface chemistry through pH-dependent changes of σ. We
can approximate36 σ for a monoprotic
acidic-terminated surface as 3  with e, Γ, pKa, β, Ceff, W the elementary charge,
number of surface chargeable
groups, dissociation constant of those groups, inverse of the thermal
energy, effective Stern layer capacitance, and Lambert W function.

Translocation of the canonical test molecule, λ-DNA,
through
a nanopore provides additional nanopore size information and directly
probes the molecular sensing performance of the nanopore. The change
in nanopore conductance, ΔGλ-DNA, due to translocation of λ-DNA (cross-sectional radius rλ-DNA, effective linear charge
density qλ-DNA) through the
nanopore can be expressed as32,37 4  where . Using eq 4 to solve ΔG = ΔGλ-DNA for rλ-DNA should yield a value consistent with the
literature radius if translocation was successful. Furthermore, when
measured with a nanopore of sufficient size, the conformational flexibility
of λ-DNA allows it to translocate linearly or folded, with corresponding
ΔG = nΔGλ-DNA (n = 1, 2, etc.):
observation of these quantized peaks should thus be further evidence
of successful nanopore formation supporting λ-DNA translocation.37,38

Results and Discussion
The Tesla coil was used to replace
the entire CDB setup of Kwok
et al.27 Simply using the Tesla coil in
place of a conventional voltage source for CDB in 1 M and even 10
mM KCl, however, was unsuccessful: post-CDB measurements of the cross-membrane
conductance produced currents beyond the dynamic range of the current
amplifier. Thus, crucial modifications were made to reduce the cross-membrane
voltage drop provided by the Tesla coil, to allow for controlled pore
formation. Fabrication was done in ultrapure water ( K−1∼ 18 MΩ cm) rather than in electrolyte medium (typically
1 M KCl with K−1∼ 1 mΩ cm),
and a 1 GΩ resistor was placed in series with the membrane and
the Tesla coil (Figure 1). Straightforward timed voltage application was precluded by the
Tesla-coil’s push-button operation with built-in circuit time
out. The number of pulses, generated by a quick push-and-release of
the button, required to generate a particular conductance value through
the 11 ± 1 nm batch of membranes was reported in place of voltage
application time (Figure 2). The minimum number of pulses needed to produce a reasonable
conductance in the range of typical nanopore measurements was ∼20.
The continued increase in the through-membrane conductance with repeated
voltage pulse applications was consistent with the increase of conductance
in conventional CDB with increasing total voltage application duration,
both consistent with increasing size of nanopores once formed.

Figure 1 Cross-sectional
view (through the PTFE custom holder) of the setup
used to fabricate a nanopore through a nominally ∼11 ±
1 nm thick SiNx membrane using a commercial
Tesla-coil lighter. One of the electrodes of the Tesla-coil lighter
was directly connected to a Ag/AgCl electrode and the other serially
through a 1 GΩ resistor.

Figure 2 Growth of conductance through a SiNx membrane
with a nominal thickness of 11 ± 1 with number of
Tesla-coil pulses. Each pulse was applied to the membrane in ultrapure
water, whereas conductance measurements were performed after exchanging
water for 1 M KCl electrolyte buffered at pH ∼ 7.

Figure 3a shows
a typical current–voltage curve observed for a nanopore fabricated
through the Tesla-coil-assisted method (TCAM) with an estimated r0 (eq 1) of ∼9 nm. Figure 3b shows a typical pH-conductance profile of a SiNx nanopore (∼12 nm) fabricated through
the conventional CDB process. The behavior of dG/dpH
is consistent with the amphoteric nature of the SiNx surface.11,39 This curve profile can be attributed
to the presence of a mixture of surface amine and hydroxyl functional
groups, with the overall surface charge density dictated by the pKa values and relative abundances of the surface
head groups.11,39 Briefly, when pH = pI, the surface
charge is zero; when pH < pI, basic functional groups will protonate
and impart a positive charge to the surface; and when pH > pI,
acidic
groups will deprotonate and impart a negative charge to the surface.
This d|σ|/dpH trend produces changes to Gsurface that increase G from its bulk-only
minimum at the isoelectric point (pI). The pI ∼ 4.3 ±
0.4 (3 unique pores) using a fit to G versus pH is
consistent with a value of ∼4.1 reported in the literature.39Figure 3c shows the pH-conductance profile of a nanopore (∼9
nm) fabricated by the Tesla-coil-assisted method: three unique nanopores
exhibited an initial plateau (|σ| ∼ 0 → Gsurface ∼ 0) followed by dG/dpH > 0 consistent with monoprotic, rather than amphoteric, surface
chemistry. It is possible that a plateau in conductance versus pH
could arise from a charged surface already fully deprotonated at pH
2 (a diprotic surface with sufficiently high pKa1, for example), but the conventional understanding
of SiNx surface chemistry would make this
an unlikely possibility. The pKa of the
monoprotic surface chargeable groups of the nanopore surface was calculated
by fitting the pH-conductance profile (using eqs 1 and 3 with Ceff and Γ free parameters optimizing to
3.1 ± 1.6 F/m2 and 16.8 ± 1.6 nm–2) to yield a best-fit
value of ∼5.6 ± 0.5 (3 unique nanopores). These results
illustrate that TCAM produces a functional ionic conductor with different
pH-dependent conductances than by conventional CDB. The trend of the
conductance with pH (Figure 3) suggests that the Tesla coil generates a nanopore with different,
ostensibly simpler, surface chemistry.

Nanopore measurements
of λ-DNA translocation (0.125 nM in
4 M LiCl buffered to pH ∼ 7) were used as an additional means
to profile the Tesla-coil-assisted nanopores. A +600 mV potential
was applied across the membrane to electrophoretically drive the λ-DNA
through a ∼9 nm nanopore. Measurements were acquired at a rate
of 100 kHz with 4-pole low pass Bessel filter built-in to the Axopatch
200B set to 10 kHz and extracted using a custom thresholding program
written in Labview. Scatter plots showing the event magnitude means
() and durations (τ) are shown in Figure 4a. We created histograms
of the current values within blockages that occurred after the addition
of λ-DNA, plotted in Figure 4b. The resulting ΔG profile
shown in Figure 4b
was fitted with the sum of three Gaussian functions, g = ∑i=13Ai e-((ΔG–μi)/(√2σi)2, with Ai, μi, and σi, the amplitude coefficient, mean, and standard deviation, respectively,
with all parameters left free. Qualitatively, the appearance of more
than two peaks is consistent with the translocation of λ-DNA
in linear and folded conformations. The first peak centered at ΔG = 0 nS corresponds to the open pore (baseline) current.
The second peak was detected only in the presence of the λ-DNA
and setting ΔG = ΔGλ-DNA with the manufacturer-provided L = 11 ± 1 nm, we calculated rλ-DNA ∈ [1.26, 1.37] (in nm), within the range of hydrated radii
values reported for DNA.40−42 The third peak was centered at
ΔG = ∼2.03ΔGλ-DNA, which is further evidence supporting the
successful use of the Tesla-coil-assisted nanopore for translocation-based
molecular sensing in that the nanopore is sufficiently large to accommodate
the passage of folded-over λ-DNA. The event duration data shown
as a histogram in Figure 4c was fit with a sum of two exponential decays ϕτexp = exp(−τ2/2σ2) × ((A1 exp(−τ/τ1) + A2 exp(−τ/τ2))θ)
that were truncated below the event duration mode, τmode, before being convolved with the Gaussian, and with all parameters
left free. Analysis of the event durations gives a ∼1000 μs
time constant corresponding to a translocation speed of ∼20
ns/base pair, comparable to translocation speeds reported for nanopores
fabricated by other means.43

Conclusions
Here, we have demonstrated a portable, time-
and cost-effective
method (TCAM) to fabricate nanopores using a hand-held Tesla-coil
lighter. The use of the Tesla-coil lighter required modifications
to the conventional CDB configuration, principally inserting series
resistance to compensate for the high fixed output voltage and applying
a discrete number of voltage pulses in place of a continuously timed
voltage. Given the need to add in series resistance to prevent uncontrolled
pore formation in the ∼10 nm thick membranes, we expect that
such a technique should be amenable for forming nanopore ionic conduction
paths through thicker SiNx membranes than
those employed here. The TCAM nanopores could successfully translocate
the canonical λ-DNA test molecule, with translocation characteristics
similar to those through more conventionally fabricated nanopores.
The nanopores showed fundamentally different surface chemistry, however,
as shown in the shape of the conductance versus solution pH curve.
In contrast to the amphoteric SiNx nanopore
fabricated by CDB, which can be pH-tuned from both charge polarities
through a neutral surface charge at the isoelectric point, these TCAM
pores exhibited a flat response to pH in acidic solution over a fairly
large range before an appreciable Gsurface onset in more basic solutions. Such behavior has two benefits. First,
the nanopore conductance is independent of solution pH over a reasonably
broad range, allowing the use of such a nanopore as a stable ionic
conductor in a range of different solutions. Second, it allows, to
an extent dictated by the presence of solution-available ionizable
groups with suitable pKa within the analyte,
tuning of analyte charge by solution pH within the plateau range without
appreciably changing the nanopore charge. That this can occur without
the need for the often difficult, and at least time-consuming, step
of initial nanopore surface chemical modification, is especially salutary
in terms of easing experimental burdens. Translocation characteristics
of λ-DNA through these nanopores were consistent with measurements
in nanopores fabricated by other means, underscoring the utility of
this fabrication method for molecular sensing, beyond simple ionic
conduction. We note, however, that such a low-overhead fabrication
route may be useful in other domains, including the straightforward
fabrication of leak valves in vacuum science, nanochannels for fundamental
condensed matter studies, or as solution apertures in nanoparticle
synthesis where conventional nanopore instrumentation overhead might
otherwise prove burdensome.13−16

Materials and Methods
Silicon nitride
membranes on silicon frames (Norcada Inc, NT005Z,
Lot # L45 with a nominal thickness of 11 ± 1 nm) were compressed
between two silicone gaskets in a custom PTFE holder with two ∼500
μL sample wells.8 The electrodes
of the Tesla-coil lighter (Tesla Coil Lighters, Amazon, ASIN: B01A02F714)
were connected, in series with a 1 GΩ resistor (Newark Electronics,
66KK6871), to 1.0 mm diameter Ag/AgCl electrodes immersed in the sample
wells of the PTFE holder containing ultrapure water (∼18 MΩ
cm), as illustrated in Figure 1. Precautions appropriate to a high voltage power supply capable
of igniting flammable materials should be observed.

After 18
pulses, the ultrapure water was exchanged with aqueous
1 M potassium chloride buffered at pH ∼ 7 with N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid potassium salt to obtain a current–voltage (I–V) curve. All electrical measurements were
carried out using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster
City, CA) in voltage clamp mode operated by custom Labview (National
Instruments Corp., TX) programs. If the conductance remained ∼0
nS (no pore formation had appeared to take place), electrolyte was
thoroughly exchanged with ultrapure water, and a small number of additional
pulses (2–3) was applied. This process was continued until
a pore, or a pore of desired size, was formed.

Curve fitting
of data was performed using the NMinimize method
of the NonlinearModelFit of Mathematica 11.0.1.0 (Wolfram Research,
Champaign, IL).
