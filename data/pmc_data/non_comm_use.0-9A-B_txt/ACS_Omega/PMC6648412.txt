Catalytic auto-oxidation with air
is a highly desirable method
for green synthesis. Described here is a method for acid-catalyzed
one step air-oxidative fragmentation of 2-aryl-1-tetralones to alkyl-2-(3-oxo-3-aryl)
benzoates in the presence of alcohol. This method was then demonstrated
using concise synthesis of a key intermediate of antiasthma drug Montelukast
sodium. Moreover, the paradoxical nature of the reaction in which
ester forms but only within a low concentration threshold of alcohol
helps in understanding the mechanism of the reaction.

Introduction
Fragmentation reactions
are highly efficient in building molecular
complexity from simpler molecular assembly.1 These aesthetically pleasing reactions are efficient by virtue of
their high atom economy and step minimization potential in a synthetic
sequence.2 On the other hand, auto-oxidation
reaction is used as the green synthetic method in which air oxygen
is a renewable oxidant.3 Hence, the synthetic
method involving auto-oxidative fragmentation is highly desirable
for efficient green synthesis.4 O2 is widely used as economic and environment-friendly oxidant in the
production of bulk chemical from simpler petroleum-derived hydrocarbons.5 However, because of lack of selectivity and control,
O2 is not commonly used as oxidant in chemical laboratory
and pharmaceutical industry.6 It is known
that carbonyl compounds undergo auto-oxidation under basic conditions
to form α-hydroperoxides, which undergo C–C bond cleavage
in both acidic and alkaline condition.7,8 Ishikawa et
al. while reporting aryl migration in air oxidation of 2-aryl-1-tetralone
also mentioned few examples in which the fragmentation product was
obtained, most notably 2-phenyl-1-tetralone 1 was converted
to benzoic acid derivative 2 as sole product in the presence
of the TsOH catalyst (Scheme 1).9

Scheme 1 The abovementioned
one step reaction slowly proceeded to form a
diarylpropane framework without any sensitizer, light or pure oxygen.
Intrigued by these reported findings, and because of the absence of
further reports in the literature for this transformation, a study
was conducted to find out the synthetic scope for acid-catalyzed air-oxidative
fragmentation of 2-aryl-1-tetralones, which were easily accessed from
1-tetralone via palladium-catalyzed α-arylation methods.10

Results and Discussion
Reaction
optimization with 1 under various conditions
was performed which is summarized in Table 1. When the reaction was performed in toluene
at 80 °C the reaction was complete within 72 h and the benzoic
acid derivative 2 formed in 88% yield. Temperature of
80 °C in toluene was found to be optimum as increasing (entry
2) or decreasing (entry 3) reaction temperature, the reaction became
slower and yield went down. The reaction also proceeded in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) with good yield. Trifluoroacetyl in toluene and HCl in THF also
catalyze the conversion with good yield. When relatively weak acetic
acid was used as solvent, the reaction proceeded but with only 38%
yield of 2 (other byproducts formed was not characterized).
No reaction was observed when the reaction was run either in methanol
or in mixed solvents of 10% (v/v) of methanol in THF (entry 9) and
10% (v/v) of methanol in toluene (entry 10). Interestingly, when 5%
(v/v) methanol in toluene was used as solvent, low yield of methyl
ester product 3a instead of 2 was obtained.
This result prompted to run the reaction in even lower alcohol concentration
in toluene. Accordingly, reaction was run in 2% (v/v) methanol and
surprisingly within 8 h starting ketone 2 was consumed
completely and 3a formed in 90% yield. Further lowering
of methanol concentration resulted incomplete reaction (data not shown).
On the other hand switching to ethanol the ethyl ester 3b formed in good yield even though reaction took longer time. However,
switching to bulkier 2-propanol, no isopropyl ester was observed even
after prolonged reaction time instead low yield of 2 was
obtained. The latter result indicates of steric constrain of alcohol
for the transformation. When the reactions (entries 12 and 15) were
run in the dark no significant change in yield observed (data not
shown).

Optimization results in Table 1 suggest that alcohol
concentration beyond a threshold
inhibits the reaction and such threshold concentration may vary in
different solvents. Further screening of the catalyst and solvent
with varying alcohol ratio would be synthetically useful. However,
with good yield obtained in toluene, TsOH combination within limited
screening, focus of this study was shifted to find out the substrate
scope as well as influence of the α aromatic group for this
new transformation. Thus reaction was carried out on α-aryl
tetralones with varying electronic nature of the α-aryl group,
summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 Auto-Oxidative Fragmentation of 2-Aryl-1-tetralones
to Methyl-2-(3-oxo-3-aryl) Benzoatesa
a All the reactions were run with
0.05 M concentration of the starting 2-aryl-1-tetralone.

b Yields reported are isolated yield.

c 1.3 equiv of the catalyst was
used.

d Reaction was run in
toluene without
MeOH, rest of the reaction mixture contained mostly aldehyde 4g.

All the reactions
were performed in 2% (v/v) of methanol in toluene.
It was generally observed that electron-donating substituent increases
the reaction rate while rate decreases with the electron-deficient
aryl group. Thus, reaction time is relatively longer in ortho and
para tolyl compounds (entries 1 and 2) compare to 1 (Table 1, entry 12), whereas
with para methoxy compound, reaction became faster, but lower yield
was obtained (entry 3). Reaction also proceeded faster in case of
α-naphthalene compound (entry 6). In contrast, slower reaction
was observed in case of p-chloro, and 3-carboxaldehyde-substituted
compounds (entries 4 and 7) even though good yields were obtained.
The catalyst amount was increased to 1.3 equiv for the α-pyridine
compound; as with 0.3 equiv of the catalyst, no reaction was observed
(data not shown) probably because of basic nitrogen of pyridine (entry
5). Under the reaction condition, the acetal group of compound 4h also hydrolyzed to give product 5g (entry
8). Interestingly, when the reaction with 4h was performed
without methanol, a small amount of 5g was obtained along
with mostly 4g (entry 9). This indicates that methanol
generated from the hydrolysis of acetal is enough to form the ester
product.

The generality of the abovementioned method was demonstrated
in
three step synthesis of a key intermediate 11 toward
synthesis of Montelukast sodium, a selective LTD4 antagonist, used
for the treatment of asthma.11 3-bromobenzaldehyde 6 was condensed with 7-chloroquinaldine 7 in
acetic anhydride to get 8 with 92% yield. Palladium-catalyzed
coupling of 8 with 1-tetralone gave α-aryl product 10, which readily underwent oxidative fragmentation to form
methyl benzoate product 11 in 82% yield.12 Alternatively, product 11 was also obtained
via condensation of aldehyde 5g (from entry 7, Table 2) with 7-chloroquinaldine 7 in acetic
acid albeit in moderate 58% yield (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Air oxidation of 2-aryl-1-tetralone
in the absence of light or
sensitizer indicates that triplet oxygen (3O2) rather than singlet oxygen (1O2) is the actual
oxidizing agent.13 Recently, quantum chemical
calculation on enol addition to triplet oxygen was found to be energetically
possible via the formation of triplet diradical (stabilized by intramolecular
H-bond) followed by intersystem crossing to the singlet state in the
formation of α-hydroxyperoxide.14 Higher alcohol concentration would disrupt such intramolecular H-bonding
and might be one possible reason for low concentration threshold found
in this study. For conversion of hydroperoxide 12 to
ester 3, two reaction paths can be plausible based on
earlier literature report (Scheme 3).9

Scheme 3 Plausible Mechanism
If the reaction follows cyclic
path A, then first benzoic acid
intermediate 2 would form en route to ester 3. However, high yield of ester formed in the reaction in the presence
of low concentration of alcohol suggests that path A involving endoperoxide 13 is unlikely. In fact, when acid 2 was heated
in 2% (v/v) methanol in toluene with 0.3 equiv TsOH. H2O for 8 h, no significant amount (<5%) of ester 3 was obtained (data not shown). This together with result from Table 2 (entry 9) suggests
the reaction mechanism is acyclic one (path B) in which addition of
alcohol initially forms hemiacetal 14 which subsequently
undergoes C–C bond cleavage to form 3.

Conclusions
In conclusion, synthetic utility of novel acid-catalyzed auto-oxidative
fragmentation combined with esterification of 2-aryl-1-tetralones
have been demonstrated. The reaction condition is relatively mild
and only air atmosphere is enough for auto-oxidation. The rate enhancement
in the presence of small alcohol concentration not only makes the
transformation synthetically more useful but also helps in understanding
the mechanism of the reaction.

Experimental Section
General Information
Starting materials, reagents, and
solvents (dry) were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without
further purifications. All reactions were conducted in oven-dried
(110 °C) glassware. Progress of reactions was monitored by silica
gel thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (with fluorescent indicator),
visualized under UV. Products were purified by flash column chromatography
on 100–200 mesh silica gel. 1H NMR were recorded
in Bruker 400 MHz (FT NMR) or Bruker 300 MHz (FT NMR) using tetramethylsilane
as an internal reference. 13C NMR were recorded in Bruker
100 MHz (FT NMR) or Bruker 75 MHz (FT NMR). High-resolution mass spectra
(HRMS) were measured on an Agilent quadrupole time-of-flight mass
spectrometer instrument with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source.
Melting points were uncorrected. The known 2-aryl-1-tetralones 1, 4a–f were prepared according to the
previously reported protocols.15−17 The unknown 2-aryl-1-tetralones 4h, 10 were synthesized following the procedure
reported by Palucki and Buchwald.18

General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Methyl-2-(3-oxo-3-aryl)
Benzoates 3a and 4
To a solution
of α-aryl tetralone (0.50 mmol) in toluene (10 mL) in a two
neck round-bottom flask was added MeOH (0.2 mL) and TsOH·H2O (29 mg, 0.15 mmol). The reaction flask was then fitted with
a condenser in one neck and air balloon on another neck. The reaction
mixture was then heated at 70 °C and monitored by TLC. Upon completion
of the reaction, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and to
that sodium acetate (0.2 mmol) was added and stirred for 10 min. The
reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl acetate (50 mL) and washed
with water (10 mL) and then brine (10 mL). Evaporation of solvent
followed by column chromatography (silica gel with ethyl acetate/hexane
as an eluent) gave the desired methyl-2-(3-oxo-3-aryl) benzoates.
