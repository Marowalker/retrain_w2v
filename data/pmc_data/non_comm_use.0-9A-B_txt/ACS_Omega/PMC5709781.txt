Understanding the
intermolecular interactions between nucleotides
and artificial receptors is crucial to understanding the role of nucleic
acids in living systems. However, direct structural evidence showing
precise interactions and bonding features of a nucleoside monophosphate
(NMP) with a macrocycle-based synthetic molecule has not been provided
so far. Herein, we present two novel crystal structures of uridine
monophosphate (UMP) and thymidine monophosphate (TMP) complexes with
a macrocycle-based dinuclear receptor. Structural characterization
of these complexes reveals that the receptor recognizes UMP through
coordinate–covalent interactions with phosphates and π–π
stackings with nucleobases and TMP through coordinate–covalent
interactions with phosphate groups. Furthermore, the receptor has
been shown to effectively bind nucleoside monophosphates in the order
of GMP > AMP > UMP > TMP > CMP in water at physiological
pH, as investigated
by an indicator displacement assay.

Introduction
In recent years, there
has been a growing interest in designing
artificial receptors that recognize nucleotides as target substrates,1−27 with the goal to mimic their
biological interactions with enzymes.25,28 Nucleotides
are the fundamental building blocks of DNA and RNA, playing many critical
roles in biology. For instance, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is used
in generating universal chemical energy for cellular functions, guanosine
triphosphate (GTP) is involved in the synthesis of DNA and proteins,
and uridine monophosphate (UMP) is the central building block in the
synthesis of RNA.29,30 Although an abundance of information
is available on solution binding studies and theoretical calculations
predicting the binding modes of nucleotides,4−26 structural reports of nucleotide complexes with synthetic receptors
are indeed limited.31−40 In 2008, Bianchi and co-workers reported the first structure of
a nucleoside triphosphate complex with a synthetic receptor, showing
hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking interactions
between a thymidine 5′-triphosphate and a polyamine-based receptor.31 Several structures of nucleotides, nucleosides,
or nucleobases as pure or mixed ligands with transition metal ions
were also reported.32−40 In particular, the central role played by nucleoside monophosphates
(NMPs) in many biological events makes them attractive targets for
mimicking their biological interactions.41−46 For instance, as characterized by X-ray analysis, UMP was found
within the cavity of a Bacillus subtilis orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase via hydrogen bonds
and salt bridges between the nucleotide and the protein.46 However, to the best of our knowledge, a crystallographically
characterized NMP complex with a macrocycle-based synthetic receptor
has not been reported yet.

Most of the synthetic receptors for
nucleotides are mainly based
on the construction of recognition sites with positive charges from
polyazamacrocycles that have been shown to be capable of binding nucleotides19−21,47−52 and of numerous catalytic activities, including hydrolase, phosphatase,
and kinase activity.53−57 Their interactions, however, occur primarily through hydrogen bonding
or electrostatic interactions between the charged groups and the phosphate
moieties of nucleotides, which often depend on the pH of the solution.
On the other hand, macrocycle-based dinuclear metal complexes are
attractive hosts that have shown to bind nucleotides through Lewis
acid/base (coordinate–covalent) interactions in water at physiological
pH.58−64 Fabbrizzi and co-workers synthesized an expanded dinuclear cryptate
that contains two copper(II) ions as binding sites to selectively
recognize GMP with respect to other NMPs in MeOH/water solution.63 It was suggested that in addition to phosphate
groups, enolate oxygen atoms of GMP formed bonds with the metal centers.
Hydrazone-based dinuclear copper(II) complexes recently synthesized
by Dharmaraj and co-workers have been shown to bind DNA via an intercalative
mode.64

Even though several transition
metal complexes have been employed
for nucleotide complexation, the design of artificial receptors that
effectively recognize nucleotides in water at neutral pH still remains
a challenge. Recently, we have been interested in simple and easily
synthesizable macrocycle-based dinuclear complexes as probes for anion
recognition, which are expected to be more flexible than their bicyclic
analogues, thereby allowing them to interact with anions of variable
shapes and sizes.65−68 As learned from nature,42−46 an ideal receptor for nucleotide binding should be designed on a
multipoint recognition strategy to bind phosphate and aromatic base
simultaneously. Herein, we describe a macrocyclic dinuclear copper(II)
receptor 1 that possesses two metal centers and two aromatic
groups, providing effective binding sites for multipoint recognition
of NMPs (Chart 1).
We have structurally characterized two NMP complexes: one with UMP
and the other with thymidine monophosphate (TMP), showing multipoint
recognition with a dinuclear copper(II) receptor 1. The
receptor and NMP alternatively assemble into a one-dimensional chain
through bonds between the phosphates and the metal ions.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The receptor 1 was synthesized
from the reaction of L with 2 equiv of CuBr2 in H2O, as described previously.65 The molecule was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis, confirming the formation of a dinuclear complex, as shown
in Figure 1. Numerous
attempts to obtain crystals of 1 with different nucleotides
provided two X-ray quality crystals of UMP and TMP complexes that
were grown from an aqueous solution of 1 containing 2
equiv of UMP and TMP, respectively. The isolated crystals were found
to be stable at room temperature and characterized by single crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis.

Crystal Structure Analysis
Receptor 1
Structural
analysis of the
dinuclear copper complex (1) reveals that it crystallizes
in the triclinic space group P1, with two CuII ions at both ends of the macrocycle, forming a dinuclear
complex. As shown in Figure 2, the macrocycle is folded, where each CuII is
coordinated with three macrocyclic nitrogens and one bromide in a
square planar coordination environment. The two square planes remaining
on the same side are approximately parallel with respect to each other,
thus allowing the macrocycle to adopt a rigid boat-like structure.
The Cu–Br distances are almost equal, with Cu–Br distances
of 2.5705(17)–2.5582(17) Å. The bonded bromides are in
equatorial positions, as opposed to the previously reported complex
[CuII2(L)Br3(H2O)]+ in which one bromide coordinated to a copper ion
in a square pyramidal geometry with an elongated Cu–Br bond
(Cu–Br = 2.959(4)).65 The remaining
two bromides (Br3 and Br4) are outside the cavity interacting with
the secondary nitrogen atoms (N4 and N19) via NH···Br
interactions. Thus, the receptor incorporates positive charges and
planar hydrophobic groups as potential binding sites.

UMP Complex
of 1
The treatment of the
receptor 1 with 2 equiv of Na2UMP in H2O/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (2:1, v/v) yielded suitable crystals
for X-ray analysis. Structural analysis by single crystal X-ray diffraction
reveals that the asymmetric unit of the complex contains two macrocycles,
four CuII ions, and four UMP groups, providing two nearly
identical UMP-bound units connected through phosphate groups (Figure 2a). The macrocycles
are faced in opposite directions, whereas both UMP groups remain on
the same side of each macrcocycle. Clearly, two coordinating bromides
in [1·Br2]2+ (Figure 1) are exchanged with two UMP
guests, forming the receptor–UMP complex. As shown in Figure 1b, two UMP units
in their anionic forms are coordinated to the macrocyclic host through
metal–ligand bonds, showing a folded conformation with aromatic
spacers between the copper binding sites. The noteworthy feature of
this structure is that each UMP binds to the receptor via two types
of intermolecular interactions: (i) traditional metal–ligand
(coordinate–covalent) interaction between CuII and
phosphate and (ii) face-to-face π–π stacking (centroid–centroid
distances = 3.61–3.63 Å)69 between
one aromatic ring of 1 and the uracil base (pyrimidine-2,4-dione)
of UMP. The two aromatic rings are slightly shifted with respect to
each other with a dihedral angle of 4.97 (1)°. Such an assembled
complex of NMP with a synthetic receptor exhibiting multipoint recognition
has not been structurally characterized before. The X-ray structure
of the protein–DNA complex reported earlier showed similar
types of interactions in which four positively charged groups on the
protein (Arg 16, 21, 80 and Lys 46) exhibited strong electrostatic
interactions with the DNA phosphates.70 Four aromatic residues (Tyr 26, 34, 41 and Phe 73) interacted via
π–π stackings with each of the five nucleotide
bases.

unit of [1·(UMP)2]2, (b) single
macrocyclic unit showing [1·(UMP)2] motif,
and (c) assembled UMP complex showing a chain along the c axis. Hydrogen atoms and external solvent molecules are omitted
for clarity.

In the complex [1·(UMP)2]2, each CuII is coordinated with three macrocyclic N atoms
and two anionic O atoms in a square pyramidal coordination environment.
The distances of Cu···O bonds are 1.921(9) (Cu1···OIC)
and 1.915(9) Å (Cu2···O1D), which are comparable
to the corresponding distances reported for a copper complex with
5′-UMP (1.92(1) and 1.93(1) Å).32 Two uracil bases of the coordinated nucleotides in the complex are
stacked with the aromatic rings of the receptor in a sandwich fashion
(Figure 2c). Thus,
this particular geometrical conformation of the receptor makes it
ideal to recognize two UMPs, providing an example of a structurally
characterized macrocycle-based nucleoside complex.

TMP Complex
of 1
We were also successful
in growing X-ray quality crystals of 1 with TMP from
the treatment of 1 with 2 equiv of Na2TMP
in water. As shown in Figure 3a, the structural aspects of this crystal are nearly similar
to that of the UMP complex, containing two macrocycles, four CuII ions, and four TMP, whereas two nearly identical TMP-bound
units are connected through phosphate groups of TMP in an asymmetric
unit. Figure 3b shows
the structural motif of a single macrocyclic unit as [1·(TMP)2], with two coordinating TMP groups on the
same side of the folded macrocycle. However, as opposed to the 1-UMP complex exhibiting strong π–π interactions,
there are no such interactions between the receptor’s rings
and the thymine base (5-thethylpyrimidine-2,4-dione) in the 1-TMP complex. This could be possibly due to the steric effect
of the methyl group that is present on the thymine base. A similar
steric effect of methyl groups was also predicted theoretically for
the binding of thymine and uracil with a cholesterol-armed triazacyclononane.71 In crystals, each TMP serves as a linker of
two macrocyclic units through phosphate and copper bonds. Notably,
in both cases, the receptor and the NMP alternatively assemble into
a one-dimensional supramolecular polymer, forming a 1-D chain through
bonds between phosphates and metal ions (Figures 2c and 3c).

Fluorescence Binding Studies
Based on IDA Mechanism
An indicator displacement assay that
was first employed by Anslyn
in anion binding chemistry72 was used to
examine the binding ability of the receptor 1 (in the
form of [Cu2LBr4]) for nucleoside
monophosphates (NMPs) in solution. As shown in Figure 4, upon the increasing addition of 1 (2.0 × 10–4 M) to EY (eosin Y, 2.0 ×
10–6 M) in water buffered with 20 mM HEPES at pH
7.4, the fluorescence intensity (I) gradually decreased
possibly due to the Lewis acid–base interactions between the
host and the negatively charged EY. The addition of 5 equiv of 1 to EY resulted in an almost complete quenching of the emission
(fluorescent OFF). This phenomenon is attributed to the formation
of a receptor–indicator complex (1·EY) that
quenches the excited state of EY through an energy-transfer process.66 The change in the fluorescence intensity (I/I0) was analyzed by a nonlinear
regression method, which gave the best fit with a 1:1 binding model,73 yielding the association constant of 5.17 (in
log K).

Figure 4 Decrease of fluorescence intensity of
EY upon the gradual addition
of 1 in water at pH 7.4. λex = 470 nm,
λem = 537 nm. The inset shows the titration plot
of I/I0 against [1]0/[EY]0.

The complex 1·EY was then investigated
for its
potential to bind several NMPs including UMP, GMP, AMP, TMP, and CMP
in water at pH = 7.4. As depicted in Figure 5, the addition of UMP (2.0 × 10–3 M) to 1·EY (1/EY =
2:1, [EY]0 =2.0 × 10–6 M) led to
a complete restoration of fluorescence intensity of EY. This observation
suggests the formation of a receptor–UMP complex while the
bound dye EY releases from 1·EY to the solution,
as signaled by the fluorescence enhancement (fluorescent ON). Similar
fluorescence enhancement was also observed on the addition of other
analytes to 1·EY (Supporting Information). Analysis of the titration data from the fitting
of I/I0 with [anion]0/[1·EY]0 suggested the formation
of a 1:1 complex. The calculated conditional constants (Kcon) for [1·EY + anion = 1·anion + EY], which are dependent on the experimental conditions,
are listed in Table 1, showing the binding strength in the order of GMP > AMP >
UMP >
TMP > CMP. For comparison, we also investigated the binding interactions
of 1·EY for ADP (as diphosphate), ATP (as triphosphate),
and inorganic phosphate. The chemosensor showed a strong binding affinity
(log Kcon) in the range from 5.12
(3) to 5.23 (3) toward GMP, UMP, and AMP, as compared to that of other
anions included. However, no interactions were observed for nucleosides,
such as adenosine, uridine, guanosine, cytidine, and thymidine, suggesting
that the binding of NMP to 1·EY occurs primarily
through the interactions of phosphate groups with 1·EY.
Several dimetallic complexes have been previously reported by others
with NMPs63 or nucleoside polyphosphate64 in solution. For example, Hamachi and co-workers
reported a xanthene-based Zn(II) complex that was shown to strongly
bind several polyphosphate derivatives in the range from (log Kcon) 5.69 to 6.23; however, it showed moderate
affinity for cAMP (3.14) and no affinity for AMP or GMP.62 The observed binding trend, as listed in Table 1, roughly suggests
that in addition to the metal–ligand interactions between the
metal centers and the phosphate groups, the higher conjugated π-rings
in nucleobases (e.g., GMP and AMP) contribute enhanced interactions
possibly due to the π–π interactions between the
nucleobases and the receptor’s aromatic groups. The appreciably
higher binding strength of the ensemble 1·EY for
UMP (log Kcon = 5.1) with respect
to that for TMP (log Kcon = 4.8)
is consistent with the crystal structure of [1·(UMP)2]2 exhibiting π–π interactions
(Figure 2a), whereas
such interactions are absent in [1·(TMP)2]2 due to the steric effect of the methyl group present
on the thymine base (Figure 3a). However, the solution binding model is in contrast to
that observed in the solid states for UMP or TMP, where suitable crystals
of the NMP complexes were obtained under different conditions. Such
discrepancy in anion binding modes in the solid state and solution
was reported in the literature.74,75 It is important to
note that at this pH, an NMP may be present as different species (e.g.,
diprotonated or monoprotonated); thus, this value may not account
for the ionic state used for the titration or present in crystals.
The results indicate that the ensemble 1·EY shows
potential to act as a “fluorescent OFF–ON” probe
for the fluorescence sensing of biologically relevant anions. A similar
ensemble of [Ni2L(H2O)6]4+ with EY was previously reported that selectively binds
biologically relevant oxalate anions, displaying the sharp color change
in water at physiological pH.67

Conclusions
We have shown that a
dinuclear receptor possessing multipoint binding
sites recognizes UMP via coordinate–covalent interactions for
phosphates and hydrophobic π–π stackings for aromatic
bases and TMP via coordinate–covalent interactions for phosphates,
resulting in the formation of two rare examples of NMP complexes with
a macrocycle-based artificial receptor. The structures clearly show
the intermolecular bonding features between two discrete molecules,
mimicking nucleotide–protein interactions, for example, in B. subtilis orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase,46 in ribonucleotide reductases of Salmonella typhimurium,42 and in single-stranded DNA with G5BP of bacteriophage fd.70 In addition, the receptor has been
successfully employed in an indicator displacement approach72 for fluorescence sensing of nucleoside monophosphates
in water at physiological pH. Understanding the interactions between
nucleotides and synthetic receptors is a key step toward understanding
the functions of nucleic acids in life. Taken together, these findings
may be useful in developing highly sensitive molecular sensors for
living cells19,20 and in drug design for biomedical
applications.64,76,77

Experimental Section
General
All reagents and solvents
were purchased as
reagent grades and were used without further purification. NMR spectra
were recorded on a Varian Unity INOVA 500 FT-NMR. Chemical shifts
for samples were measured in CDCl3 and calibrated with
TMS as an internal reference. The elemental analysis was carried out
using an ECS 4010 Analytical Platform (Costech Instrument). Fluorescence
titration studies were performed using a Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer
(HORIBA Scientific) in water at pH 7.4. The pH was adjusted by using
0.02 M HEPES purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company. Experimental
conditions were used as follows: λex = 470 nm, λem = 537 nm, dex = 2, and dem = 3 for eosin Y dye.

Synthesis
L
The free macrocycle
was synthesized following the procedure as described before.65 In a typical reaction, N-methyl-2,2′-diaminodiethylamine
(1.1719 g, 10.0 × 10–3 mol) in CH3OH (350 mL) and terephthalaldehyde (1.3413 g, 10.0 × 10–3 mol) in CH3OH (350 mL) were added slowly
to a three-neck round-bottom flask containing 500 mL of CH3OH over 6 h under stirring at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was
further stirred overnight at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated,
and the imine thus obtained was reduced with NaBH4 (1.56
g) at room temperature for 8 h. The solvent was removed under reduced
pressure, and the resulting reaction product was dispersed in water
(100 mL). The macrocycle was extracted from the aqueous phase to organic
phase by CH2Cl2 (3 × 100 mL). The organic
portions were collected and dried by anhydrous MgSO4 (2
g). The solid was filtered off and the solvent was evaporated to dryness.
The crude product was purified by column chromatography (neutral alumina,
2% CH3OH in CH2Cl2). Yield: 1.6342

[Cu2II(L)Br4]·H2O, 1
The free amine L (146
mg, 0.332 mmol) was mixed with 2 equiv of CuBr2 (148 mg,
0.662 mmol) in 5 mL of H2O. The solution was stirred at
60 °C for 1 h. After the solvent was evaporated under reduced
pressure, the solid product was suspended in 2 mL of diethyl ether
and collected by filtration. The blue microcrystals were dissolved
in 2 mL of water–methanol mixture (1:1, v/v) and recrystallized
by slow evaporation of the solution, providing air stable X-ray quality
crystals after 3 days. Yield: 247 mg, 84%. Anal. Calcd for C26H44Br4Cu2N6O: C, 34.57;

was further characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis.

[Cu2II(L)(UMP)2]2·2(C2H6OS)·24H2O
The metal complex
(1) (88 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of water–DMSO
(5:1, v/v) with 2 equiv of UMP (uridine 5′-momophosphate disodium)
(74 mg, 0.2 mmol). After the solution was stirred for 20 min at room
temperature, the mixture was kept for crystallization at room temperature,
yielding X-ray quality crystals after one month. The compound was
characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis.

[Cu2II(L)(TMP)2]2·14H2O
The metal complex (1) (88 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of water–DMSO
(5:1, v/v) with 2 equiv of TMP (thymidine 5′-momophosphate
disodium) (73 mg, 0.2 mmol). After the solution was stirred for 20
min at room temperature, the mixture was kept for crystallization
at room temperature, yielding X-ray quality crystals after 1 month.
The compound was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis.

Fluorescence Binding Studies
Binding Constant of 1 for EY
The binding
affinity of 1 for EY was determined from the titration
of EY with 1 in water at pH 7.4. The pH of the solution
was maintained using 20 mM HEPES in water. In this case, the quenching
of fluorescence was observed due to the addition of 1 to EY. Initial concentrations of EY and 1 were 2.0
× 10–6 and 2.0 × 10–4 M, respectively. Each titration was performed by 20 measurements
varying [1]0/[dye]0 = 0–20,
and the conditional constant K was calculated by
fitting the ratio of I/I0 (Φ =I/I0, where I0 = initial fluorescence intensity of EY, I = fluorescence intensity after the addition of 1) with a 1:1 association model73 using
the equation (the error limit in K was less than
15%).  

Binding Constant of 1·EY for NMP
The binding affinity of 1·EY for different NMPs
was examined from the competition reaction, and binding constants
were calculated from the titration of 1·EY with
anions in water under the same experimental conditions described in
the preceding section. Initial concentrations of 1·EY
and an NMP were 2.0 × 10–6 and 2.0 × 10–3 M, respectively. In this case, EY was displaced from 1·EY by the addition of an NMP, resulting in an enhancement
of the fluorescence intensity. Each titration was performed by 20
measurements varying the [anion]0/[1·EY]0 = 0–200, and the association constant K was calculated by fitting the ratio of I/I0 (Φ = I/I0, where I0 = initial fluorescence
intensity of 1·EY, I = fluorescence
intensity after the addition of an anion) with a 1:1 association model73 using the equation (the error limit in K was less than 15%).  

X-ray Crystallography
The crystallographic data and
details of data collection for the crystals (1, [1·(UMP)2]2 and [1·(TMP)2]2) are given in Tables S1–S3. Intensity data for 1 and [1·(UMP)2]2 were collected using a diffractometer with a
Bruker APEX ccd area detector and graphite-monochromated Mo Kα
radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å),78,79 whereas those
for [1·(TMP)2]2, with a Rigaku
diffractometer, with a Pilatus CMOS area detector and Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å),80 as described before.81 The structures
were refined by SHELXL2013 program.82

There were two macrocycles, four Cu(II) ions, and four UMP groups
in the asymmetric unit of the cell for [1·(UMP)2]2. The asymmetric unit contains 24 water molecules
and two DMSO molecules (not shown in figures for clarity). One of
the two DMSO molecules was shown to be disordered. The occupancies
of the T-labeled DMSO refined to 0.665(10) and 0.335(10) for the unprimed
and primed atoms, respectively. Restraints on the positional parameters
of the disordered DMSO, the positional parameters of hydrogens bonded
to N and O atoms of the complex, and the displacement parameters of
two water oxygens were required. In the case of [1·(TMP)2]2, there were also two macrocycles, four Cu(II)
ions, and four TMP groups per asymmetric unit. Several waters were
so disordered that they were best fit using the Squeeze program.83 Restraints on the positional parameters of the
disordered atoms and the displacement parameters of all atoms were
required. CCDC 1015181, 1019485, and 1536988.
