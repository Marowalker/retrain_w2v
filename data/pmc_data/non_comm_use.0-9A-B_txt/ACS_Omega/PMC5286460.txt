Molecular probes
that selectively highlight pancreatic cancer (PC)
tissue have the potential to improve pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) margin assessment through the selective highlighting of individual
PC cells. Herein, we report a simple and unique family of systematically
modified red and near-infrared fluorescent probes that exhibit a field-effect-derived
redshift. Two of thirteen probes distributed to the normal mouse pancreas
following systemic administration. One selectively accumulated in
genetically modified mouse models of PDAC. The probe exhibited intracellular
accumulation and enabled visualization of four levels of the structure,
including the whole organ, resected tissue, individual cells, and
subcellular organelles. In contrast to the small-molecule probes reported
previously, it possesses an inherent affinity toward PDAC cells and
thus does not require conjugation to any targeting agent. The fluorescent
probe can thus promote new strategies not only for precision image-guided
surgery, but also for PC detection, monitoring of therapeutic outcomes,
and basic research.

==== Body
Introduction
It was estimated that
approximately 53 000 people would have been diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer (PC) in the United States in 2016 and would have
had a postdiagnosis life expectancy of 5–7 months.1 PC is projected to become the second leading
cause of cancer-related death by 2030.2 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most prevalent form
of PC. Current screening for PDAC using techniques such as magnetic
resonance imaging and computed axial tomography is relatively expensive
and ineffective, as over half of all cases are diagnosed after metastasis
has occurred, limiting treatment options. Surgical resection is the
treatment of choice because chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy
alone do not significantly improve life expectancy.3 Unfortunately, surgical resection is only possible in 15–20%
of cases.4 Moreover, to date there has
been no intraoperative guidance to differentiate malignant pancreas
from normal pancreatic tissues. PC and healthy tissue are currently
distinguished through white light visualization and palpation as well
as by rapid frozen section (FS) analysis using histopathological pattern
recognition through standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
while the surgical resection is in progress.5

Intraoperative assessment of PDAC margin status during surgery
is challenging using current technology. Nearly 75% of all patients
have residual disease from margins not assessed by FS analysis. Limitations
of FS analysis include negative assessments due to time constraints
in the operating room and microscopic metastases not detected at the
time of surgery.6 In addition, cellular
architecture distortion and tissue artifacts are common issues that
occur during FS sample preparation. Slides produced by formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue processing would be highly desirable over FS-based H&E; however,
it is well known that the tissue processing time is too lengthy for
intraoperative use.

Fluorescence imaging has the potential to
improve PDAC detection
during surgery via the use of highly tumor-specific molecular probes
to facilitate tumor identification. It offers the potential for less
subjective, rapid, real-time ex vivo confirmation of negative margin
status during surgery. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores have excitation
and emission maxima between 650 and 900 nm, where hemoglobin and H2O have their lowest absorption coefficients. Moreover, NIR
phonons cause minimal photoinduced damage to biological samples and
have relatively high tissue penetration depth and signal-to-background
ratios (SBRs). Therefore, NIR probes can enhance the overall image
quality and collection time. However, to date there are no clinically
approved PC-specific fluorescent dyes. Commercially available dyes,
including the only FDA-approved in vivo fluorescent contrast agents,
indocyanine green, methylene blue (MB), and fluorescein, exhibit nonspecific
fluorescence and largely act as blood pool agents.

Results and Discussion
One of the main challenges in PDAC therapy is drug delivery and
is largely attributed to the hypovascular and fibrotic tumor microenvironment.7 Thus, to attain desirable PDAC-selective accumulation
and SBR, we have synthesized a focused library of systematically modified
1-substituted benzo[c]xanthene fluorophores (Figure 1) to begin to define
factors modulating tissue biodistribution,8 such as probe size, lipophilicity, solubility, and ionization state.
To minimize the effects of autofluorescence, these compounds were
designed to exhibit significant bathochromic shifts compared to traditional
long-wavelength 3-substituted benzo[c]xanthenes via
the formal repositioning of polar groups.9−12

Figure 1 1-Substituted benzo[c]xanthene library.

Compounds 1–13 (Figure 1) were designed taking into
account the uptake and related “drug-like” properties
that can be used as quantitative descriptors for predicting and optimizing
biodistribution and tissue targeting.13 The predicted absorption spectra and physicochemical properties
of 1–13 are shown in Figures S1–S3 (Supporting Information
(SI)). Compounds 1–13 exhibit maximum absorption
peaks between 400 and 650 nm and are within the requirements to be
considered for tissue targeting according to the Lipinski14 and Veber15 rules.
Log D values ranged from 0.5 to 5 (Lipinski
rule: <5), molecular weights were between 400 and 500 g/mol (Lipinski
rule: <500 g/mol), 0–4 hydrogen bond donors (Lipinski rule:
<5) and 4–5 hydrogen bond acceptors (Lipinski rule: <10)
were present, and polar surface areas ranged between 48 and 87 Å2 (Veber rule: <140 Å2). Experimental details
for the synthesis of each compound are provided in the SI.

The spectral properties of this series
of probes (1–13), based on seminaphthofluorescein,
seminaphthorhodafluor, and seminaphthorhodamine
scaffolds, were screened for pH and solvent dependence (Figure 2, Table 1, and Figures S4–S9). Absorption and fluorescence spectra of compounds containing ionizable
hydroxyl groups (seminaphthofluorescein 1 and seminaphthorhodafluors 3, 5, and 11) exhibited pH dependence
over the physiological range (Figures S4 and S5) and solvatochromic effects (Figure S5). In aqueous solution, the hydroxyl forms of 1, 3, 5, and 11 were red emitting,
whereas their conjugate bases exhibited NIR fluorescence. Solvent
dependence is at least partially attributable to differences in the
equilibria between tautomeric forms of the compounds in the various
solvents tested. Solvent and pH sensitivity were addressed via derivatization.
Methoxy-functionalized analogues (2, 4, 6, and 12) displayed relatively bright red fluorescence
and were independent of variations in pH (Figures S6 and S7) and solvent composition (Figure S7). Replacing the hydroxyl group with an amine generated a
series of NIR-emitting seminaphthorhodamines (9, 10, and 13). The spectral properties of 9, 10, and 13 were pH independent
and only modestly dependent on solvent composition (Figure S8). Transposition of the hydroxyl and amine functionalities
in seminathorhodafluors 3 and 5 generated
compounds 7 and 8. This lowered their pKa values, resulting in spectral properties that
were not pH dependent in the physiological range.

to 15 μM. Aqueous solutions contain 10% DMSO and 12.5 mM HCl,

or 510 nm, and NIR-emitting fluorophores were excited at 630 nm. Emission
spectra are normalized to their corresponding absorption peaks. Excitation
Emission Matrices (EEMs) are provided in the SI.

Compounds 2, 12, and 13 are
representative of the three classes of benzo[c]xanthenes
designed in this study and were chosen as candidates for initial in
vivo and ex vivo screening for pancreas and PDAC targeting based on
the following considerations. First, their predicted physiochemical
properties (Figures S1–S3) cover
a relatively broad range of log D values,
enabling evaluation of the influence of lipophilicity on targeting.
Second, each exhibits desirable pH independence. Third, their spectral
properties (Figures S6–S8) show
that they have the highest quantum yield and brightness within each
of the three classes of benzo[c]xanthenes. The predicted
physicochemical properties of 2, 12, and 13 are shown in Figure 3, allowing correlation between the in vitro and in vivo targeted
localization and the molecular characteristics of the synthesized
fluorophores. In vitro cell viability (Figure S10A) and time-dependent fluorophore uptake (Figure S10B) were assessed in the presence of compounds 2, 12, and 13 in Capan-1 cells (a
representative PDAC cell line). The cytotoxicity studies demonstrated
that compound 2 was the least toxic (IC50 30.08
μM), followed by compounds 13 (IC50 26.08
μM) and 12 (IC50 17.79 μM). Each
fluorophore exhibited similar kinetics, demonstrating uptake within
30 min of fluorophore application. Compound 13 exhibited
the greatest uptake and 2 the lowest during this period.

and summary of calculated physicochemical properties
of 2, 12, and 13. Color-mapped
surfaces show the molecular electrostatic potential (blue is positive,
green is neutral, and red is negative).

The subcellular localization of 2, 12, and 13 was investigated in Capan-1 cells after 1 h
incubation. Organelle-specific fluorescent probes were used to assess
the site-specific uptake of each fluorophore. The preferential intracellular
localization of compound 2 (Figure S10C) was within vesicular structures that may embody lipid
droplets, endosomes, or other membrane-based vesicles. In contrast
to 2, compounds 12 (Figure 4) and 13 (Figure S10E) demonstrated more homogeneous distribution across
cells with extensive accumulation in the mitochondria (Mito) as well
as limited accumulation in the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 12 and 13 are cationic, and they distribute electrophoretically
in the mitochondrial matrix in response to the electric potential
across the mitochondrial membrane.16

cells. Images of subcellular organelles stained with commercial fluorescent
trackers (top row) are labeled 4’-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (blue), ER (green), or Mito (green); bottom row contains merged
view of compound 12 with fluorescent organelle trackers.

The initial biodistribution profile
screening of 2, 12, and 13 was
carried out in healthy
CD-1 mice and compared to that of MB to assess their pancreas specificity
(Figure 5). Compound 12 exhibited the highest and most persistent fluorescence
SBR in the pancreas as compared to that in the surrounding organs
at the 4 h time point. It had a 4-fold higher uptake in normal pancreas
tissue as compared to that of previously studied MB (log D = −0.62). MB extravasated to some degree but demonstrated
poor penetration into normal pancreas tissue (Figure S11). The low in vivo efficacy of MB could be attributed
to its relatively low lipophilicity and high water solubility, as
it is preferentially and rapidly cleared through the renal system
after systemic administration. MB’s low tissue fluorescence,
rapid clearance rate, and reduced bioavailability limited its pancreas
tissue selectivity and thus its potential for image-guided surgery
applications. From the study herein, higher log D value compounds 2 and 12 exhibited improved
pancreas specificity, whereas 13 and MB had relatively
lower log D values and diminished pancreas
accumulation, which correlates well with previous studies.13,17

Genetically engineered mouse models
of PDAC tumors that recapitulate
the clinical, pathological, and genomic features of human PDAC18,19were used to assess the specificity of the designed fluorophores
for PDAC accumulation both in vivo and ex vivo. Compound 12, which afforded the highest pancreas tissue uptake in healthy mice,
was chosen for further study in the genetically modified PDAC tumor-bearing
mouse model. Ex vivo staining of pancreas tissue derived from healthy
and PDAC mice showed that their characteristic features were highlighted
by 12 (Figure 6A). The healthy mouse pancreas tissue showed uptake of 12 in its abundant acinar cell population. In contrast, in
the cancerous tissue, 12 localized in the PDAC-associated
ductal epithelial cells, enabling them to be observed via an increased
fluorescence signal that was visually brighter compared to that of
the acinar cells in the healthy tissue. Thus, 12 enabled
ex vivo staining to distinguish the features of healthy and PDAC tissue
ex vivo (Figure 6A).

tissue from PDAC tumor-bearing mice ex vivo either following systemic
administration of compound 12 (top) or from an uninjected

Compound 12 was systemically administered to n = 5 genetically modified PDAC mice. Pancreas-specific
fluorescence was monitored over a 1.5 h period. Significantly more
fluorescence was seen in compound 12-injected PDAC-bearing
animals compared to that in uninjected control PDAC-bearing animals
(Figure 6B,C). After
euthanasia, the pancreas was assessed microscopically for PDAC-specific
fluorophore accumulation. Representative intraoperative fluorescence
images over time as well as the in vivo organ biodistribution kinetics
of compound 12 are shown in Figure S12.

Representative serially sectioned tissues stained
with pan-cytokeratin
to assess PDAC specificity of compound 12 confirmed that
accumulation of compound 12 in the PDAC tumor tissue
was significantly higher than that in the surrounding tissues and
that compound 12 showed specificity for the malignant
cells (Figure 7). H&E
staining of the PDAC specimens revealed that uptake of 12 occurred in ductal tissue epithelial cells, similar to the ex vivo
staining pattern (Figures 6A and 7). This is consistent with the
fact that pancreatic ductal epithelial cells give rise to PDAC.20 Furthermore, the accumulation of 12 in PDAC mouse acinar cells (Figure 7D) also demonstrated colocalization with the pan-cytokeratin
immunofluorescence staining. This supports studies that have shown
that genetic mutations of acinar cells are associated with precancerous
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia that progresses to PDAC over
time.21,22

with 12 to those obtained with the antibody confirms
their similar PDAC-staining patterns.

Conclusions
In summary, the synthesis of a focused probe
library with predictable
physicochemical properties afforded a simple molecular probe (12), enabling the imaging of PDAC in a genetically engineered
mouse model both in vivo and ex vivo, providing the opportunity for
dual clinical utility. Compound 12 offers highly attractive
characteristics, such as high contrast, tumor specificity, and adaptation
to clinical and intraoperative workflows. Conjugation to a biological
targeting agent was not required for PDAC tumor specificity. Compound 12 functioned at the level of the whole organ, enabling visualization
of a cancerous pancreas with excellent SBR. It targeted PDAC tissue
and cells as evidenced by comparison with H&E staining and the
immunohistochemistry pan-cytokeratin assay, and it allowed for ready
distinction between individual cell morphologies. At the subcellular
level, it demonstrated accumulation in the mitochondria. Compound 12 is highly tumor specific, enabling the imaging of PDAC
at four different levels of structure in a genetically engineered
mouse model. It thus possesses desirable properties for promoting
enhanced PC detection, therapeutic monitoring, and image-guided surgery.

Methods
Prediction
of Physicochemical Properties and Molecular Modeling
Physicochemical
partition coefficient (log  D) values
at pH 7.4 were calculated using Marvin and JChem
calculator plugins (ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary). Molecular orbital,
UV–vis spectra, and electrostatic map calculations were performed
using density functional theory modeling on gas-phase B3LYP/6-31G
optimized geometries using Gaussian 09.23

Synthesis of Fluorescent Probes
Seminaphthofluorescein,
seminaphthorhodafluors, and seminaphthorhodamines (Figure 1) were synthesized in two to
three steps. The initial step involved the condensation of hydroxybenzophenones
with the corresponding naphthols in a mixture of CH3SO3H/TFA 1:1 at 80 °C for 16–24 h to produce the
lactones or carboxylates. Subsequent Fisher esterification to produce
the methyl ester derivatives was carried out in MeOH catalyzed by
either H2SO4 or HCl. Further alkylation was
attained by treatment of either the carboxylate or methyl ester intermediate
with methyl iodide in the presence of K2CO3 in
dimethylformamide to produce the corresponding methyl ethers. The
required starting materials, 2-(2,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid,
2-(4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, 2-(8-hydroxy-1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydropyrido[3,2,1-ij]quinoline-9-carbonyl)benzoic acid, and 1,8-naphthalene
derivatives, were synthesized according to described or modified literature
protocols. In general, overall good yields were obtained for most
of the fluorophores included in this series with the exception of
the condensation products between 2-(2,4- dihydroxybenzoyl)benzoic
acid and 8-amino naphthol derivatives 7 and 8, where the major isolated product corresponded to fluorescein. All
compounds were isolated by flash column chromatography or preparative
thin-layer chromatography and characterized by NMR and high-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

UV–Vis Absorption
and Fluorescence Spectroscopy
UV–vis spectra were
collected using a Cary 50 UV–vis
spectrophotometer at room temperature (rt) using a reduced-volume
1 cm quartz cuvette. Fluorescence spectra were collected on a Cary
Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). All
absorption spectra were reference corrected. Fluorescence spectra
were corrected for the wavelength-dependent response of the R928 photomultiplier
tube using a manufacturer-generated correction file. Quantum yields
were reported as the average of multiple measurements using multiple
references. EEMs were collected over various spectral regions, using
5 or 10 nm step sizes for emission and excitation. The band pass for
excitation and emission was 5–10 nm.

Cell Culture
The
human PDAC cell line Capan-1 was obtained
from Dr. Rosalie Sears’s laboratory at Oregon Health and Science
University (OHSU) and was maintained in RPMI medium (Gibco) in a humid
atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All media were supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin.
Cell viability was determined by Cell Titer-Blue assay. Monolayers
of 104 Capan-1 cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well
plates and incubated with decreasing concentration from 100 μM
of each compound in growth media containing 10% FBS. After 24 h incubation
time, 20 μL of Cell Titer-Blue reagent was added into each well
and culture cells were incubated for additional 2 h. Fluorescence
intensity in each well was recorded at 560/590 nm using a SpectraMax
M5 Microplate Reader. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 2, 12, and 13 were determined by interpolating values in the graph (% cell viability
vs fluorophore concentration). For the comparison of cellular uptake
rates in Capan-1 cells, the absorbance of the media was measured as
background, and the absorbance of the supernatant was obtained to
determine the cellular uptake, using the absorbance of 10 μM
fluorophore in cell-free media as the standard reference.

In Vitro Live
Cell Imaging
Monolayers of 104 Capan-1 cells were
seeded in triplicate in eight-well plates and
incubated for 24 h in growth mediun containing 10% FBS and were allowed
to attach. For subcellular colocalization experiments, the medium
was extracted and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), and phenol red-free growth medium was added to each well. Organelle
trackers were added to each well, and incubated with the fluorophore
of interest (final concentration 0.5 μM) for 1 h. Cells were
washed with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Fluorescence
microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss inverted microscope with
an Axioscan fluorescence camera for imaging. The final concentrations
of organelle trackers used were as follows: DAPI 0.5 μM, Mito-tracker
green 0.5 μM, and ER-tracker green 1 μM.

Animals
Approval for the use of all animals in this
study was obtained from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) at OHSU. Male CD-1 mice weighing 22–24 g were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Genetically engineered
mouse models of PDAC based on the targeted expression of an oncogenic
KRAS mutation (KRASG12D) in the mouse pancreas were used to model
the human disease. Mice expressing the KRAS mutation alone, termed
“KC mice”, develop the full range of intraductal neoplastic
lesions (PanINs) that are histologically indistinguishable from human
PanINs. The mice develop PanINs with 100% penetrance, but these lesions
do not progress to metastatic disease.19,24 A modification
of the KC mouse that was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Rosalie
Sears (Department of Molecular & Medical Genetics, Oregon Health
and Science University) was used to more closely model human PDAC.
This mouse model, termed “KMC mice”, included overexpression
of the wild-type Myc oncogene,25,26 similar to their previously
published breast cancer mouse models.27 This PC mouse model developed PanIN lesions by 10 weeks of age and
rapidly progressed to PDAC, including metastatic disease, more closely
representing the human disease (Sears Lab OHSU, unpublished data).
Both KC and KMC mice were used to assess compound 12 accumulation
in PDAC. All animals were placed on 5V75 chlorophyll-free diet from
TestDiet (St. Louis, MO) 1 week before any imaging studies. Before
surgery, mice were anaesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg
xylazine (Patterson Veterinary, Devens, MA). The peritoneal cavity
was surgically exposed by removal of the overlying skin and muscle
tissue to image fluorophore biodistribution following intravenous
injection.

Intraoperative Fluorescence Imaging System
In vivo
murine biodistribution images and macroscopic images of resected tissues
were acquired using a custom-built small animal imaging system capable
of real-time color and fluorescence imaging. The imaging system consists
of a QImaging EXi Blue monochrome camera (Surrey, British Columbia,
CA) for fluorescence detection with a removable Bayer filter for collecting
co-registered color and fluorescence images. A PhotoFluor II light
source (89 North, Burlington, VT) was focused onto the surgical field
through a liquid light guide and used unfiltered for white light illumination.
For fluorescence detection, the light source was filtered using a
545 ± 12.5, 620 ± 30, or 650 ± 22.5 nm bandpass excitation
filter for compounds 2 and 12, compound 13, and MB fluorescence excitation, respectively. The resultant
fluorescence was collected using a 605 ± 35, 700 ± 37.5,
or 720 ± 30 nm bandpass emission filter for compounds 2 and 12, compound 13, and MB image collection,
respectively. All filters were obtained from Chroma technology (Bellows
Falls, VT). Camera exposure times ranged from 50 to 200 ms for fluorescence
image collection. All images collected for comparison between treatment
groups were acquired with the same exposure time and are displayed
under equal normalized brightness and contrast levels where indicated.

Systemic Administration of Fluorescent Compounds
For
initial in vivo testing and biodistribution studies, 100 nmol of compounds 2, 12, and 13 were injected systemically.
Fluorophores were diluted in PBS. For comparison with previous studies,
120 nmol MB was injected systemically. Mice were administered blank
PBS for control images (n = 3 mice per group, 5 groups).
For PDAC tumor mice model testing 100 nmol of compound 12 was injected systemically (n = 5 mice).

In Vivo
Biodistribution Imaging
The biodistribution
of compounds 2, 12, and 13 was
assessed using the intraoperative fluorescence imaging system to collect
images of the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was exposed,
and images were collected so that the bladder, adipose tissue, intestine,
kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, spleen, and stomach were visible
within the field of view. For initial biodistribution studies, images
were collected immediately after injection and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120,
and 240 min following injection. For MB injected mice, images were
collected for the same time course, but only up to 60 min due to the
rapid clearance of MB.
For PDAC tumor-bearing mice, images were collected immediately after
injection and at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min following injection. Vehicle-injected
control animals were imaged for the same time course as the fluorophore-injected
animals for initial testing or immediately following injection only
for studies involving MB or PDAC tumor-bearing mice to assess tissue
autofluorescence for comparison to injected animals. Fluorophore biodistribution
kinetics were measured using region-of-interest analysis on images
collected of the peritoneal cavity. Mean fluorescence intensities
in each organ or tissue type were measured from images collected at
each time point. All intensities were normalized to the muscle intensity
at that time point by dividing by the measured muscle intensity. Using
the normalized fluorescence intensities for each organ or tissue type,
mean intensities were calculated for each group. Upon completion of
initial biodistribution studies, animals were euthanized and their
organs were resected. Macroscopic images of the resected organs were
collected using the intraoperative fluorescence imaging system, and
the mean fluorescence intensity of each resected organ was measured
using region-of-interest analysis. Fluorescence intensities were normalized
to the muscle intensity in the same manner as in vivo measurements.
Mean intensities were calculated for each group using the normalized
values. For biodistribution studies in PDAC tumor-bearing mice, only
the pancreas was resected and imaged following euthanasia.

Ex Vivo
Fluorescence Microscopy, Pathology, and Immunofluorescence
Staining
The resected pancreas tissue from compound 12 in vivo biodistribution studies with PDAC tumor-bearing
mice was fixed with 2% PFA for 12 h, flash frozen in optimal cutting
temperature (OCT) compound with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80
°C. Cryosections were cut at 10 m onto Superfrost Plus slides
(Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific). Slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G
(Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) and coverslipped. Serial sections
were obtained for cytokeratin immunofluorescence microscopy, enabling
imaging of compound 12 and immunofluorescence labeling
with 0.01 mg/mL of directly labeled anti-pan-cytokeratin conjugated
to AlexaFluor 488 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Briefly, slides were
rinsed with PBS for 2 min to remove residual OCT. Then, slides were
fixed by immersion in 2% PFA for 15 min and washed with PBS for 5
min three times. Primary antibody was incubated on the slides for
1 h at rt. Following incubation, slides were washed with PBS three
times for 5 min each, then postfixed with PFA for 15 min, and washed
with PBS once for 5 min before mounting with Fluoromount-G. For cytokeratin
immunofluorescence controls, serial sections were stained using the
above immunofluorescence procedure but without antibody present in
the staining solution that was incubated on the slides. For H&E
pathological analysis, slides previously stained for cytokeratin expression
were unmounted and rinsed with PBS to remove residual mournting media
before H&E staining. Images were acquired on an Axio Observer
inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) at 10, 20,
or 40× magnification. A PhotoFluor II was used unfiltered for
H&E color images and filtered using a 545 ± 12.5 or 470 ±
20 nm bandpass excitation filter for compound 12 or Atto
488 excitation, respectively. Color images were collected using an
Axiocam 105 camera (Zeiss) and fluorescence images were collected
using an Axiocam 506 camera (Zeiss), where a 605 ± 35 or 525
± 25 nm bandpass emission filter was used for compound 12 or Atto 488 fluorescence image collection, respectively.
