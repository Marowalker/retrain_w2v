Rhein
(4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid) is an anthraquinone
compound mainly isolated from the herbal medicine rhubarb. It possesses
a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects. However, the lack of sustained
release properties and the poor bioavailability hinder clinical transformation.
Hydrogel-based drug delivery system provides an ideal carrier to improve
the release control and the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. Herein,
we present a chitosan hydrogel for the delivery of rhein. This rhein–chitosan
hydrogel (CS–Rh gel) exhibited superior characteristics including
mechanical strength, sustained release, and low toxicity. For medical
application, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot
analyses indicated that CS–Rh gel significantly suppressed
the production of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α
and IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 cells. Additionally,
CS–Rh gel blocked the neuroinflammation-related mitogen-activated
protein kinase (JNK, ERK, and p38)-signaling pathways. Interestingly,
these inhibitory effects at 48 h outperformed the pharmacologic actions
at 24 h, showing that the CS–Rh gel exerted optimal sustained
antineuroinflammation. This study highlights a novel chitosan hydrogel
containing rhein used as a potential antineuroinflammatory agent.

==== Body
Introduction
Drug delivery systems represent a promising
therapeutic agent as
carriers to enhance pharmaceutical efficacy. They commendably achieve
long-term release of their payloads,1 realize
drug retention in the injured tissues,2 avoid unacceptable toxicity,3 etc. These
properties may replenish the therapeutic drawbacks, which the conventional
administration of a drug through oral or intravenous has faced.4 Therefore, considerable attention has been focused
on the applications of drug delivery systems in medical and biotechnological
fields.5

With the development of
drug delivery systems, the polymeric hydrogel
has been provided as an attractive choice.6 Polymeric hydrogels are three-dimensional cross-linked polymers
with a strong capacity for expansion following water adsorption. The
polymeric hydrogels contain natural and synthetic polymers. In contrast,
the natural polymers show better biocompatibility and biodegradability,
as well as lower or null toxicity.7 Chitosan,
a naturally derived amino polysaccharide obtained from the partial
deacetylation of chitin, displays versatile characteristics such as
biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and antibacterial
activity. Hence, the chitosan-based hydrogel is the ideal drug carrier
for disease treatment.

Neuroinflammation is a prevalent pathological
feature of neurological
diseases, including traumatic brain injury, cerebral ischemia, and
intracerebral hemorrhage.8−11 The release of proinflammatory factors triggers the
death of neuronal cells, which is detrimental to the tissue repair
of the brain. Despite the fact that several antineuroinflammatory
agents have shown promising results, many of them failed in the clinical
trials. Finding an antineuroinflammatory drug for the clinical application
is urgently required and encouraged.

Fortunately, herbal medicines
are now considered as potential bioactive
candidates against diseases. The pharmacologist Youyou Tu, who won
the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, has discovered the
herbal medicine artemisinin for the treatment of malaria.12 Additionally, arsenic trioxide is recommended
as the first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia.13 The incorporation of herbal medicine into the
mainstream of medical systems has been commended by the World Health
Organization. Hence, neuroscientists and pharmacists tend to explore
natural products from the library of herbal medicines that function
as antineuroinflammatory agents.14

Rhein (4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid) is a lipophilic
anthraquinone compound mainly isolated from the herbal medicine rhubarb
(Rheum palmatum L. or Rheum tanguticum Maxim, Dahuang in Chinese).15 Rhein performs pharmacological antineuroinflammation.16 Unfortunately, the clinical translation has
been hindered by various factors: (1) rhein has been demonstrated
as a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP450, which can completely inactivate
drug-metabolizing enzymes, thus resulting in adverse effects;17 (2) moreover, rhein undergoes metabolism in
the liver, in particular, the glucuronidation, exhibiting low bioavailability.18 Recently, Lai and Rogach highlight the hydrogels
to enhance the delivery efficacy of herbal medicine.19 Thus, adopting chitosan-based hydrogel loads with rhein
is expected to overcome the therapeutic challenges.

Herein,
we fabricated a rhein–chitosan hydrogel (CS–Rh
gel) and evaluated its mechanical strength with sustained release
properties. For further medical study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated
BV2 microglial cells were performed as an in vitro neuroinflammatory
model. Finally, the antineuroinflammatory responses of the CS–Rh
gel were tested.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Materials
All chemical reagents and solvents
were used as received without further purification unless otherwise
noted. Chitosan (low molecular weight, 75–85% deacetylated)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rhein (purity > 98%, HPLC) was
obtained
from Natural Field Bio-Technique Co., Ltd. (Xi’an, China).
All of the other reagents were of analytical grade. Deionized water
(Milli-Q, 6.8 MΩ) was used throughout this study.

Synthesis of
CS–Rh Gel
Chitosan solution was
obtained by dissolving chitosan in 1% v/v acetic acid aqueous solution.
The rhein powder was dissolved in 0.1 M NaHCO3. All solutions
were chilled in an ice bath for 15 min. Then, the rhein solution was
added dropwise to the chitosan solution by evenly stirring at ice
bath condition. The mixed solution was placed not less than 37 °C
to allow the gelation. Gelation time was determined by the test tube
inverted method. Here, the concentration of rhein in the hydrogel
was controlled at 0–2.5 mg/mL. The concentration of chitosan
was 6.67 mg/mL. Each final liquid solution was clear and homogeneous.

Structure of CS-Rh Gel
Micrographs of the external
surface of CS–Rh gel were obtained by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, FEI HELIOS NanoLab 600i) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, FEI Titan G2 60-300). The concentration of rhein in the solution
was 1.4 mg/mL.

Rheological Analysis
Rheological
characterization of
the samples was carried out on a rotated rheometer (AR 2000ex, TA
Instrument). We performed dynamic frequency sweep measurements (frequency:
0.1–100 Hz; strain: 0.1%; T = 25 °C),
strain sweep measurements (strain: 0.01–100%; frequency: 10
rad/s; T = 25 °C), and time sweep measurements
(the first step the strain was 0.1%, 120 s; the second step the strain
was 40%, 20 s; frequency: 10 rad/s; circulation for 5 times). The
concentration of rhein in the solution was 1.4 mg/mL.

Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
The
FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum
One instrument. Potassium bromide was mixed with powdered samples
to prepare thin films for studies. All spectra were recorded by transmittance
mode at different wavelengths from 4000 to 400 cm–1. Potassium bromide without samples was used as the control. The
concentration of rhein in the solution was 1.4 mg/mL.

Drug Release
The solution was formed from phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4, 10 mmol/L) solutions containing rhein (1.1,
1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 mg/mL). A 3 mL sample of the release medium was
soaked up from the sample vials periodically and replenished with
a 2 mL fresh PBS to maintain a constant volume. The rhein in the medium
was measured at 228 nm using the ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV-2450,
Shimadzu, Japan). A cuvette filled with fresh PBS was scanned as a
blank to provide a spectral background in the ultraviolet determination.

Cell Culture
Mouse BV2 microglial cell lines were provided
by the Institute of National Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource
(Beijing, China). BV2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a 5%
CO2-humidified incubator at 37 °C.

Cytotoxicity
Test
The cells were seeded in the 96-well
plates (1 × 104/well cells) and allowed to attach
overnight. A series of concentrations of CS–Rh gel (5, 10,
and 20 μM) were added to each well for 24 h. Next, 10 μL
of MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well for
an additional 4 h. After removing the supernatant, 150 μL of
DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the resulting formazan crystals.
The optical density was determined.

LPS-Induced Inflammation
and Drug Treatment
BV2 cells
were plated at a density of 1 × 105/well in 6-well
plates and incubated overnight to become near confluent. Cells were
then incubated at 37 °C and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL)
for 24 or 48 h in the presence or absence of CS–Rh gel. Experiments
included cells grown in the medium alone as the control.

Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
The productions
of TNF-α and IL-1β in the supernatant of the treated and
untreated BV2 cell cultures were determined using ELISA kits (CUSABIO,
Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Western Blot Analysis
BV2 cells were washed with PBS
and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer. After 30 min on ice, the lysates
were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to produce
whole-cell extracts. The supernatants were collected. The protein
concentrations were measured using the bicinchoninic acid (Cwbiotech)
method. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto poly(vinylidene difluoride)
membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 5% skim milk for 2
h before incubating with the following primary antibodies: rabbit
anti-JNK (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit anti-p-JNK (1:200, Santa Cruz), rabbit
anti-ERK (1:10 000, Abcam), rabbit anti-p-ERK (1:500, Abcam),
rabbit anti-p38 (1:200, Proteintech), rabbit anti-p-p38 (1:1000; Abcam),
rabbit anti-IL-1β (1:200, Proteintech), rabbit anti-TNF-α
(1:1000, Abcam), mouse anti-β-actin (1:4000, Proteintech), or
rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:2000, Proteintech) antibody at 4 °C for
overnight and then with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit
secondary antibody (1:6000, Proteintch) and antimouse secondary antibody
(1:3000, Proteintch) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunopositive
bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo
Fisher) and a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS digital documentation system (Bio-Rad).
The band density was quantified using Image J software. The amount
of protein expression was presented relative to the levels of β-actin
or ratio of phosphorylated protein: total protein.

Immunofluorescence
BV2 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 25 min and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Cells
were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37 °C
and followed by either of the primary antibodies: mouse anti-TNF-α
(1:50, Proteintech) and rabbit anti-IL-1β (1:50, Proteintech)
at 4 °C overnight. The cells were subsequently incubated with
the corresponding Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse lgG (1:1000,
Proteintech) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit lgG (1:1000,
Proteintech) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were counterstained
with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 37 °C. Images were obtained
using a laser confocal microscope (TCS SP8 X & MP, Leica, Germany).

Statistical Analysis
All data in this study are presented
as the mean ± standard deviation. Data were analyzed by a one-way
analysis of variance. SPSS 18.0 was used for the statistical analyses.
The criterion for statistical significance was p <
0.05.

Results and Discussion
Morphology and Characteristics of the CS–Rh
Gel
As shown in Figure 1A, the mixture of chitosan and rhein was liquid at
4 °C and
formed a nonflowing gel at 37 °C. The gelation time was within
2 min. Temperature-induced gelation of chitosan/rhein solutions was
observed. This thermosensitive property may help the CS–Rh
gel undergo in situ gelation in the body and easily fill irregular
cavities.20 The representative photographs
of the gel showed its saffron yellow and homogeneous appearance (Figure 1A). In addition,
these hydrogels stayed their original gel state for up to 3 months
under room temperature (Figure 1B). It indicates that CS–Rh gel is stable for over
a long period. The interior morphology of the CS–Rh gel was
examined in the freeze-dried state and observed by SEM and TEM (Figure 1C). The samples displayed
highly connected polymer network morphology.

Figure 1 Morphology and rheological
characteristics of the CS–Rh
gel. (A) Images of the solution state at 4 °C and hydrogel state
at 37 °C; (B) CS–Rh gel stayed its original gel state
for up to 3 months; (C) SEM and TEM exhibited the polymer network
morphology of the CS–Rh gel; (D–F) Oscillatory shear
rheology of the CS–Rh gel. G′ is the
storage modulus and G″ is the loss modulus.

The frequency sweep of the hydrogel
suggested that the values of
the storage modulus (G′) were greater than
the loss modulus (G″). In addition, the G′ and G″ values were freely
dependent on frequency, confirming the solid-like behavior of the
CS–Rh gel (Figure 1D). The results of strain-dependent oscillatory shear rheology
showed a strain at a yield of 17.8% (this was the strain at the cross
point of G′ and G″,
which described the transition of the gel network to a liquid state; Figure 1E). The step-strain
measurements exhibited material properties of the CS–Rh gel
recovered completely and rapidly when transitioning from a high magnitude
strain (40%) to a low-magnitude strain (0.1%) for over five cycles
of breaking and reforming (Figure 1F). This phenomenon reveals the dominant elastic nature
of the gel. The good mechanical strength of the CS–Rh gel provides
the possibility for its application in bioengineering.21

Structure of the CS–Rh Gel
FTIR spectra of chitosan
and CS–Rh gel were compared to explore the structure of CS–Rh
gel (Figure 2A). As
to the chitosan, the characteristic band of 3446 cm–1 was due to the existence of OH. It shifted to 3268.75 cm–1 and became broad after the CS–Rh gel formation. The apparent
peaks at 1565.9 and 1415.4 cm–1 were attributed
to the amido bond and CN stretching vibration, respectively. After
gelation, the peaks shifted from 1565.9 to 1380.7 cm–1 and from 1415.4 to 1228.4 cm–1. The strengthened
intensity of the peaks revealed the formation of hydrogen bonding
between chitosan and rhein. FTIR analysis demonstrated that the amino
group of chitosan has conjuncted with the carboxyl group of rhein.
In the presence of 1% acetic acid, CS–NH2 was converted
into a protonated aminosaccharide unit (CS–NH3+) (Figure 2B,a). Additionally, rhein was completely dissolved in the NaHCO3 and ionized into an acid radical ion (Figure 2B,b). Subsequently, the interactions between
the positive ion and negative ion took place, resulting in the gelation
(Figure 2B,c). The
experimental results suggest that it is feasible to constitute hydrogels
through the interactions between chitosan and rhein.

release study. (A) FTIR spectra of chitosan
and CS–Rh gel; (B) theoretical CS–Rh gel formation;
and (C) CS–Rh gel exhibited sustained release property.

Drug Release Study
The accumulated amount of rhein
released from the hydrogel is presented in Figure 2C. The release profiles exhibited a fast
release rate in the first 24 h and then experienced a moderate release
within 100 h. The CS–Rh gel displayed a long-term sustained
release property. As the concentration of rhein increased, the release
rate declined. The reason may be that the carboxyl group derived from
rhein has a high potentiality to increase the number of intermolecular
hydrogen bonding in CS–Rh gel. This property tends to strengthen
the cross-linked network, leading to the sustained release. Therefore,
the release control of CS–Rh gel ensures the improved and prolonged
pharmacological activities for medical application.22

CS–Rh Gel Provides No Affection on
the Viability in Vitro
The cytotoxicity of CS–Rh gel
was assessed by the cell viability
of BV2 cells. After MTT assay, the results indicated that there was
no significant cytotoxicity on BV2 cells at the ranges from 0 to 20
μM (Figure 3A).
According to the results of MTT assay, 3 and 15 μM of CS–Rh
gel were selected for further medical studies. BV2 cell line, a well-known
microglial cell line from the murine brain, exhibits both phenotypic
and functional properties of reactive microglial cells.23 The present study illustrates that the CS–Rh
gel shows high biocompatibility, implying that the hydrogel is an
ideal potential delivery system for rhein.

antineuroinflammatory responses of the CS–Rh
gel in LPS-induced BV2 cells. (A) CS–Rh gel provided no significant
effect on the viability of BV2 cells (N = 4/group);
(B, C) ELISA exhibited that LPS dramatically increased the productions
of TNF-α and IL-1β compared with the controls at both
24 and 48 h, while the high dose (15 μM) of CS–Rh gel
reduced the levels of TNF-α by 43.08% and IL-1β by 45.72%
at 24 h. When the treatment continued to 48 h, the hydrogel alleviated
the expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β by 72.03 and 52.41%,
respectively (N = 3/group); (D) representative Western
blot expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β; (E, F) Western blot
analysis showed that CS–Rh gel (15 μM) reduced the expressions
of TNF-α by 57.43% and IL-1β by 39.44% at 24 h in the
LPS-induced BV2 cells. When the treatment continued to 48 h, the hydrogel
alleviated the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β by 74.96 and
41.81%, respectively (N = 3/group). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

CS–Rh Gel Inhibits
the LPS-Induced Inflammatory Responses
in BV2 Cells
To evaluate the effects of CS–Rh gel
on proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, we examined
the expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β. The ELISA demonstrated
that LPS dramatically increased the productions of TNF-α and
IL-1β compared with the controls at 24 and 48 h (Figure 3B,C). We further found that
15 μM of CS–Rh gel significantly suppressed the secretions
of TNF-α and IL-1β at both 24 and 48 h (Figure 3B,C). Interestingly, compared
with the LPS group, the 15 μM of CS–Rh gel reduced the
levels of TNF-α by 43.08% and IL-1β by 45.72% at 24 h
(Figure 3B,C). When
the treatment continued to 48 h, the hydrogel alleviated the expressions
of TNF-α and IL-1β by 72.03 and 52.41%, respectively (Figure 3B,C). The observations
suggest that these attenuations reinforced by CS–Rh gel at
48 h present a larger degree, which may reflect the sustained release
of antineuroinflammatory responses. Hence, 15 μM of CS–Rh
gel is chosen as the drug dose in the following experiments.

Further Western blot analysis confirmed that LPS notably increased
the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β compared with the controls
at 24 and 48 h (Figure 3D–F). Compared with the LPS group, CS–Rh gel reduced
the levels of TNF-α by 57.43% and IL-1β by 39.44% at 24
h (Figure 3E,F). When
the stimulation continued to 48 h, the hydrogel lowered the expressions
of TNF-α and IL-1β by 74.96 and 41.81%, respectively (Figure 3E,F). It is evident
that CS–Rh gel caused an excellent sustained released antineuroinflammation.
Further cellular immunofluorescence labeled by TNF-a (red) and IL-1β
(green) confirmed the suppressive effects of CS–Rh gel on LPS-induced
inflammation in BV2 cells (Figure 4).

staining

in LPS-induced BV2 cells in the presence or absence of CS–Rh
gel (scale bar = 25 μm).

Microglia, a type of resident macrophage cells in the central
nervous
system undergoes rapid activation in the process of neuroinflammation.24 In response to injury and other stimuli, the
over-activated microglia cells migrate to the damaged areas, secreting
huge amounts of proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and
IL-1β. These excessive inflammatory factors are detrimental
to neurons, contributing to the pathogenesis of neuronal disorders.25 Previous studies have shown that regulating
these proinflammatory mediators improves neuroinflammatory diseases.26 In this study, LPS-induced BV2 cell line was
used as the in vitro model for the screening and evaluation of the
antineuroinflammatory efficacy. We found that the antineuroinflammatory
responses of the CS–Rh gel at 48 h were superior to the effects
at 24 h. It illustrates that the sustained released property of the
hydrogel contributes to the prolonged pharmacological activities.

CS–Rh Gel Suppresses MAPK (JNK, ERK, and p38) Phosphorylation
in LPS-Induced BV2 Cells
We next investigated the effects
of CS–Rh gel on MAPK-signaling pathways in LPS-induced BV2
cells (Figure 5A–D).
LPS significantly increased the levels of the p-JNK (at 24 and 48
h), p-ERK (at 48 h), and p-p38 (at 24 and 48 h). CS–Rh gel
markedly caused dephosphorylations of JNK (at 48 h), ERK (at 48 h),
and p38 (at 24 and 48 h) compared with the LPS group (Figure 5B–D). The results suggest
that CS–Rh gel obviously blocks the neuroinflammation-relevant
MAPK-signaling pathways. Furthermore, the hydrogel triggers the controlled
release inhibitions.

Figure 5 Effects of CS–Rh gel on the MAPK-signaling pathways
in LPS-induced
BV2 cells. (A) Representative Western blot expressions of p-JNK, JNK,
p-ERK, ERK, p-p38, and p38; (B–D) Western blot analysis showed
that the levels of the phosphorylations of JNK (at 24 and 48 h), ERK
(at 48 h), and p38 (at 24 and 48 h) were notably increased in the
LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. CS–Rh gel markedly suppressed p-JNK
(at 48 h), p-ERK (at 48 h), and p-p38 (at 24 and 48 h) compared with
the LPS group (N = 3/group). *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

The MAPK-signaling pathways are
considered as the classical pathways
that regulate the neuroinflammatory responses.27 The activations of MAPKs lead to the massive releases of
inflammatory factors (such as TNF-α and IL-1β) and initiate
a strong oxidative stress response, consequently accelerating the
inflammatory processes.28 The MAPKs mainly
include JNK, ERK, and p38.29 Pharmacological
interference with the MAPK-signaling pathways is considered to be
a promising antineuroinflammatory strategy. In the present study,
a drastic and rapid increase in the phosphorylation of MAPKs was found
in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. CS–Rh gel significantly deactivated
MAPK (JNK, ERK, and p38) phosphorylations. The findings indicate that
CS–Rh gel regulates the neuroinflammation-associated signaling
pathways.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed
a novel CS–Rh gel with superior
characteristics including good mechanical strength, sustained release,
and low toxicity. The hydrogel provides sustained antineuroinflammatory
effects (Figure 6).
This study highlights a novel chitosan hydrogel containing rhein from
herbal medicine used as a potential antineuroinflammatory agent.

attenuated proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β
in LPS-induced BV2 cells. Moreover, the antineuroinflammatory effects
were associated with the inhibition of MAPK (JNK, ERK, and p38)-signaling
pathways.
