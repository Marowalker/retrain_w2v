The arylative oxygenation of the
electron-rich olefins styrene,
α-methylstyrene, vinyl pyrrolidinone, and vinyl oxazolidinone
was accomplished using arenediazonium salts and catalytic amounts
of FeSO4 in an effective single electron transfer radical
process. A broad range of aryldiazonium salts was tolerated using
water, methanol, or their combination with acetonitrile to furnish
the corresponding carbohydroxylated and carbomethoxylated products
(42 examples), including functionalized dihydroisocoumarin and dihydrobenzofuran
systems in good to excellent yields (up to 88%). The protocols developed
for the Fe(II)-catalyzed carbohydroxylation were also compared to
Ru(II) and Ir(III) photoredox carbooxygenations of these electron-rich
olefins. The Fe(II)-catalyzed process proved to be highly competitive
compared to the photoredox and the uncatalyzed processes. The proposed
mechanism for the Fe(II)-catalyzed reactions involves the synergic
combination with an effective Fe+2/Fe+3 redox
system and a radical polar crossover mechanism featuring an unprecedented
capture of the reactive N-acyliminium in the case
of vinyl pyrrolidinone and vinyl oxazolidinone.

Introduction
Arenediazonium salts
are synthetically versatile compounds which
are prone to thermal and photochemical decomposition allowing the
preparation of a variety of aryl radicals (Scheme 1A).1,2 For many decades, these
well-known reactive intermediates have been useful tools for the construction
of C–C bonds, and recently, they have also been instrumental
in the realization of quite a number of important transformations.2 Besides the thermal and photochemical procedures,
aryl radicals can also be generated by single electron transfer (SET)
from electron-rich olefins to arenediazonium salts,3 although such procedures usually require large excesses
of the olefins. Despite their efficiency, such procedures make these
reactions less viable as a synthetic method when we consider cost,
sustainability, as well as its practical aspects with respect to the
isolation and purification of the desired product (Scheme 1B).4,5 The
formation of aryl radicals from arenediazonium salts can be also promoted
by transition metals, such as Fe, Cu, and Ti. Examples are well documented
in the literature, usually in stoichiometric or over stoichiometric
amounts to achieve synthetic relevant results (Scheme 1C).6 Among the
available approaches to generate aryl radicals from arenediazonium
salts, the use of Fe is particularly attractive due to its availability,
low cost, low toxicity, and versatility in ionic and radical processes,6a but, surprisingly, its catalytic version is
unprecedented in the literature. Inspired by recent developments and
applications of aryl radicals in organic synthesis,1 we decided to investigate the Fe-catalyzed carbohydroxylation/carbomethoxylation
of readily available electron-rich olefins, such as styrenes, vinyl
pyrrolidinone, and enecarbamates (Scheme 1D). We also briefly compared our Fe-catalyzed
protocols with some already established photoredox processes, to take
into account their relative efficiency and practicality.

Scheme 1 Application
of Aryldiazonium Salts in Radical Reactions
Results
and Discussion
Our studies began with the styrenes due to
their well-recognized
synthetic potential and the precedents available in the literature.7 We selected α-methylstyrene and 4-CF3-benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate as a reaction model to
compare the FeSO4·7H2O-catalyzed conditions
and the photoredox conditions using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O and Ir(ppy)3 as photocatalysts.
Additionally, the use of styrenes provided us the opportunity to reinvestigate
the excellent work reported by Heinrichet al., where SET conditions
were employed to promote their arylation but using a 6-fold excess
of the starting styrene to achieve good yields of the carbohydroxylated
products.4

After some experimentation
(see Supporting Information for optimization), we found that the use of 11
mol % FeSO4·7H2O and just 1.5 equivalents
of α-methylstyrene in MeCN/H2O (4:1) furnished the
carbohydroxylated product 3 in an 87% isolated yield
after 4 h at 60 °C (Table 1, entry 1), whereas the protocol of Kindt et al. using 6 equivalents
of α-methylstyrene is reported to furnish 3 in
57% in 15 min at 70 °C (Table 1, entry 2). For comparative purposes, we also carried
out some photoredox reactions of this model reaction using commercially
available Ru and Ir catalysts. The photoredox arylations gave product 3 in 70 and 63% yields after 12 h, using 5 mol % [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O and Ir(ppy)3, respectively (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). Somewhat surprisingly, the noncatalyzed reaction
furnished a 65% yield of the carbohydroxylated product 3, but only after 12 h at 60 °C (Table 1, entry 5). This latter result indicates
a clear tendency of electron-deficient arenediazonium salts to generate
aryl radicals under thermal or photochemical conditions and was not
totally surprising. However, it should be pointed out that this result
was achieved after a long period of time (12 h). In contrast, the
FeSO4-catalyzed arylation provided a higher yield (90%
yield) of compound 3 in only 4 h, clearly demonstrating
the influence of catalytic FeSO4 in the arylation process.

In view of the
encouraging results with the FeSO4-catalyzed
carbohydroxylation, the scope of this process was then evaluated employing
several electronically distinct arenediazonium salts having styrene,
and α-methylstyrene as substrates (Table 2).

e Reaction performed in pure MeCN.

The protocol allowed the synthesis
of carbohydroxylated systems
from arenediazonium salts containing electron-donating, electron-neutral,
and electron-withdrawing substituents. Most importantly, the privileged
dihydroisocoumarin and dihydrobenzofuran systems were obtained in
good yields (up to 73%) using ortho-hydroxy benzenediazonium
and ortho-carbomethoxy benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborates.
These bicyclic systems constitute the framework for many bioactive
natural products such as silvestrol and amycofuran.8 Notably, compounds 3e, 3g, 3h, and 3i synthesized in somewhat lower yields
of 38, 48, 26, and 23%, respectively, were obtained by Kindt et al.
in only 6, 23, 10, and 12% yields using large excesses of the starting
styrenes.4 In spite of these low yields
with the Fe-catalyzed reactions, they highlight the clear synthetic
advantage of the Fe catalysis on rather challenging substrates. Furthermore,
the FeSO4-catalyzed carbooxygenations displayed in Table 2 indicate that the
radical polar crossover mechanism as proposed by Heinrich to explain
the formation of the carbohydroxylated products does not seem to be
the major pathway operating under the Fe-catalyzed conditions since
the polar crossover mechanism is more efficient when using large excesses
of styrenes. Therefore, the main involvement of a Fe+2/Fe+3 redox mechanism seems to be a more plausible rationale for
outcome of these reactions. The lower yields obtained with electron-rich
arenediazonium salts are due to their lower efficiency to propagate
the radical chain reaction under SET conditions, mainly in the case
of styrenes.1

Having established
a successful Fe(II)-catalyzed route to the carbooxygenation
reaction of styrenes, we then sought to evaluate the generality of
our protocol with other olefins. Vinyl pyrrolidinone, a readily available
and inexpensive olefin used in a number of studies aiming at the development
of new synthetic methods, was then chosen as a viable substrate for
the Fe-catalyzed carbooxygenations.11

The distinct electronic characteristic of vinyl pyrrolidinone we
compared to the styrenes was another interesting feature to choose
it as a new substrate for our studies. We then selected 4-methoxyphenyldiazonium
tetrafluoroborate 2e as the arylating partner, ZnCO3 as base, and water as the solvent for a preliminary investigation
toward the carbohydroxylation of vinyl pyrrolidinone 4 (Table 3). Water
was chosen for its greener nature and because all reaction components
are soluble in this solvent. Starting with two equivalents of olefin
in the absence of FeSO4, the carbohydroxylated product 5e was obtained in 40% after 24 h, with only partial consumption
of the aryldiazonium salt (Table 3, entry 1). In agreement with literature reports,4,5 a large execess of the olefin 4 (7 equiv) accelerated
the reaction, furnishing a moderate 68% yield of the carbohydroxylated
product 5e after 1 h (Table 3, entry 2). Carbooxygenation of olefin 4 (2 equiv) and 5.5 mol % FeSO4 at 40 °C provided 5e in 62% yield after 24 h (entry 3). However, to our delight,
raising the reaction temperature to 60 °C gave a good yield (79%)
of the desired product 5e after only 30 min (entry 4).
Performing the reaction under open-flask conditions provided 5e in 70% after 3 h, demonstrating a surprising tolerance
of the reaction to oxygen (entry 5).12

With the basic
reaction parameters established, we evaluated the
reaction scope using water or methanol as a solvent to give the method
a greener aspect (Table 4). Therefore, contrary to the protocol developed for styrenes, the
carbooxygenation of vinyl pyrrolidinone can be carried out in pure
H2O or methanol avoiding the use of acetonitrile as co-solvent.

tetrafluoroborate (0.3 mmol, 1 equiv), 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone 4 (67 mg, 0.6 mmol, 2 equiv), ZnCO3 (56 mg, 0.45

mol %), H2O for 5a–o,and
MeOH for 5p–r (1.5 mL), nitrogen
atmosphere. Isolated yields were calculated from an average of two
runs.

b Reaction performed
in gram scale.

Having water
as the solvent, the method provided good yields of
the carbohydroxylate product regardless of the electronic nature of
the arenediazonium salts or its substitution pattern, with the exception
of the naphthyldiazonium salt, which furnished the product 5i in 37% yield.

The robustness of the protocol was further demonstrated
by performing
the synthesis of carbohydroxylated product 5j at the
gram scale (73% yield, 1.14 g, 4.75 mmol). The reaction also proved
effective in methanol, but with a significant decrease in yields.
The methoxylated products 5p–r were
achieved with yields of 34, 39, and 56% respectively. The use of anhydrous
methanol did not improve the yields.

Once the feasibility of
the FeSO4-catalyzed carbohydroxylation
of vinyl pyrrolidinone was demonstrated, photoredox approaches for
the carbohydroxylation of 4 employing 3-CF3-benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate 2h were investigated
in a way to compare our best Fe-catalyzed result in Table 5 (5h) with photoredox
alternatives. Under our standard reaction conditions, the N,O-hemiacetal 5h was obtained
in an excellent 81% isolated yield after 30 min (Table 5, entry 1). The Ru and Ir photoredox
reactions furnished 70 and 45% yield of 5h, respectively,
after 12 h of light irradiation (entries 2 and 3), whereas the uncatalyzed
reaction provided only 38% of 5h after 12 h (entry 4).
As observed with the styrenes, the FeSO4-catalyzed carbohydroxylations
of vinyl pyrrolidinone exhibited a superior performance to both photoredox
reactions.

Taken together,
the results shown above with the styrenes and vinyl
pyrrolidinone encouraged us to extend the FeSO4-catalyzed
carbooxygenation to another electron-rich olefin, the readily available exocyclic enecarbamate 6. However, due to its low solubility in water, the addition
of acetonitrile as co-solvent was necessary, as well as a catalyst
loading of 11 mol % FeSO4 to reach yields comparable to
those observed with vinyl pyrrolidinone and styrenes (Tables 2 and 4).

The carbohydroxylation/carbomethoxylation of enecarbamate 6 proved to be reasonably efficient for different arenediazonium
salts, providing the products 7c–t in yields ranging from 43 to 69% regardless of the electronic nature
of the arenediazonium salt (Table 6).

b Reactions performed in methanol.

Following the procedures adopted before, for comparative
purposes,
the photoredox carbohydroxylation of vinyl oxazolidinone 6 with Ru and Ir catalysts was carried out, together with the uncatalyzed
reaction. To our satisfaction, the results shown in Table 7 indicate that the Fe (II)-catalyzed
carbohydroxylation of olefin 6 is highly competitive
with the photoredox protocols.

To demonstrate
that these stable carbohydroxylated products (N,O-hemiacetals) can be converted into
potentially synthetic intermediates, the N,O acetal 5j was selected for some straightforward
transformations. The carbohydroxylated product 5j was
then efficiently converted into the corresponding unsaturated compound
(90% isolated yield) under mild acidic conditions with Amberlyst.
Oxidation of compound 5j with o-iodoxybenzoic
acid (IBX) gave the corresponding imide in 57% isolated yield, as
demonstrated in Scheme 2 (nonoptimized conditions).

Reagents and reaction conditions:

acetone (7.5 mL), rt, 1 h. (ii) 5j (0.3 mmol), IBX (126
mg, 1.5 equiv), EtOAc (6 mL), 65 °C, 8 h. Isolated yields in
both cases.

Although a radical mechanism for
these transformations was anticipated
in view of literature precedents,1 the
role and impact of the Fe+2/Fe+3 redox system,
as well as the putative formation of an intermediate iminium ion/carbocation—the
point of entry of a nucleophile—were not evident under our
protocol conditions. Therefore, to confirm the nature of the intermediates
involved, we carried out the reaction of arenediazonium salt 2e with vinyl pyrrolidinone 4 in the presence
of TEMPO. Gratifyingly, the reaction provided the TEMPO adduct 8, which was isolated and characterized (Scheme 3), thus indicating the presence
of the expected radical intermediates in the carbohydroxylation/carbomethoxylation
reactions.

Scheme 3 Proposed Catalytic Cycle for the Fe(II)-Catalyzed
Reaction of Vinyl
Pyrrolidinone and the Vinyl Oxazolidine with Arenediazonium Salts
With this finding in hand, it was possible to
rationalize the formation
of the carbohydroxylated/carbomethoxylated products 3, 5, and 7 involving the contribution of
several factors (Scheme 3): the aryl radical A can be generated from the aryldiazonium
salt by three different pathways: (i) the formation of a thermolyzable
electron donor–electron acceptor complex between the electron-rich
olefin and the diazonium salt,13 (ii) via
single electron transfer (SET) with a Fe(II) species, or (iii) by
a radical polar crossover mechanism. Subsequently, the aryl radical A undergoes anti-Markovnikov radical addition to olefin B, generating the intermediate C, which can then
perform another SET process with a Fe(III) species, regenerating the
Fe(II) catalyst, or yet, reacting directly with another aryldiazonium
salt through a radical polar crossover mechanism.4

The polar crossover mechanism proposed by Heinrich
for the carbooxygenation
of styrenes appears to play a secondary role when associated with
the Fe+2/Fe+3 redox system. The carbooxygenation
reactions of styrenes, vinyl pyrrolidinone, and vinyl oxazolidinone
using catalytic Fe(II) are usually fast, whereas the uncatalyzed reactions
of these olefins lead to low yields of the carbooxygenated product
after a long period of time. For example, the uncatalyzed carbohydroxylation
of α-methylstyrene (1.5 equiv) gives a reasonable yield of 65%
of 3d only after a period of 12 h (Table 1, entry 5). Nevertheless, a synergic combination
of the Fe+2/Fe+3 redox system and the radical
polar crossover mechanism cannot be entirely discarded in the case
of styrenes. A rationale for the Fe(II)-catalyzed carbohydroxylation
of the styrenes is presented in Scheme 4.

Carbohydroxylation

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a synthetically useful Fe(II)-catalyzed
carbohydroxylation/carbomethoxylation protocol for electron-rich olefins
such as styrenes, vinyl pyrrolidinone, and vinyl oxazolidinone. To
the best of our knowledge, these studies constitute the first examples
of a Fe-catalyzed carbohydroxylation/carbomethoxylation of these olefins.
Overall, our results demonstrate that for vinyl pyrrolidinone and
vinyl oxazolidinone, the putative N-acyliminium intermediates
can be effectively trapped by a nucleophile to yield the corresponding
carbohydroxylation/carbomethoxylation products, which are frameworks
found in several natural products and useful advanced intermediates.8,14−16 In the case of styrenes, in contrast to a literature
report,4 only a small excess of the starting
olefin was required for effective Fe(II)-catalyzed carbohydroxylation
or carbomethoxylation.

The effective production of aryl radicals
from arenediazonium salts
by a Fe-catalyzed ground-state electron-transfer process has allowed
the synthesis of valuable intermediates, including dihydrocoumarin
and dihydrobenzofuran systems in good to excellent yields under mild
conditions.

Experimental Section
General Information
Unless otherwise
indicated, all
common reagents and solvents employed were obtained from commercial
suppliers and no further purification was performed. The aryldiazonium
salts were prepared from methods described in the literature.17 1-Vinyl-2-pyrrolidone and styrenes were distilled
under reduced pressure prior to their use. Iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate
was purified following the literature procedure.18 3-Vinyloxazolidin-2-one 6 was synthesized
following the literature procedure.19

All NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance 400 or 500 MHz spectrometer,
employing residual nondeuterated solvent signal as an internal reference
(CHCl3 = 1H 7.26 ppm, 13C 77.0 ppm).
All results are reported as follows: chemical shift (δ) (multiplicity,
coupling constant, integration). Splitting patterns are indicated
as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, qui
= quintet, dd = doublet of doublets, td = triplet of triplets, m =
multiplet, b = broad, app = apparent. All coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz). Note: the CDCl3 employed in the NMR analysis was previously passed through a short
pad of basic alumina to avoid decomposition of the N,O-acetals.

High-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) was conducted using electrospray
ionization (ESI) (Waters Xevo Q-Tof, Thermo LTQ - FT Ultra, or Thermo
Q Exactive).

Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed
employing Merck
Silica gel 60 F254 plates using short-wave (254 nm) UV light and ethanolic
phosphomolybdic acid solution (5% m/v) as a color reagent.

IR
spectra were recorded on an Agilent Technologies Cary 630 FTIR
using attenuated total reflectance technique, with scans between 4000
and 650 cm–1, with 8 cm–1 resolution.
The compounds were analyzed in its pure form on a germanium sample
holder. The maximum absorbing frequencies are reported in cm–1.

Chromatographic purifications were performed on a Biotage—Isolera
One flash purification system employing Biotage SNAP Ultra 10 g cartridges
and operating in a gradient mode (EtOAc/hexanes) with a flow rate
of 36 mL/min.

Melting points were determined on a capillary
melting point apparatus
and are uncorrected.

Isolated yields were calculated from an
average of two runs.

General Procedure for the Meerwein Carbooxygenation
of Styrenes,
Vinyl Pyrrolidinone, and Vinyl Oxazolidinone (3, 5, 7)
A screw-capped vial containing
a magnetic stirring bar was charged with FeSO4·7H2O (5.5–11 mol %), solvent (1.5 mL), olefin (0.45 mmol,
1.5 equiv for 1 or 0.60 mmol, 2.0 equiv for 4 and 6), ZnCO3 (57 mg, 0.45 mmol, 1.5 equiv),
and the corresponding arenediazonium salt (0.3 mmol, 1 equiv) (this
order of addition must be followed since it plays an important role
in the overall reaction). For compound 3, MeCN/H2O (4:1, v/v) was used as the solvent; for the specific case
of compound 3q, the solvent was anhydrous MeCN. For compounds 5, the solvent was pure H2O, except for compounds 5p–r, when MeOH was used. For compound 7, H2O/MeCN (4:1, v/v) was used as solvent, except
for 7r–t, when MeOH was used.

The vial content was slightly shacked after each addition. The vial
was then sealed with a cap containing a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
septum, and the system was flushed with N2 for 2 min. A
nitrogen balloon connected to a needle was attached to the vial through
a septum, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for the
defined reaction time. Next, the vial was opened and the reaction
mixture was placed on the top of a sodium sulfate/silica gel plug
and then rinsed with EtOAc (3 × 20 mL). The solvent was evaporated,
and the products were purified by flash chromatography.

form (75 mg), and acetone (7.5 mL). The round-bottom flask was sealed,
and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h.
The vial was opened, and the crude reaction mixture was filtered through
a cotton plug, which was then rinsed with EtOAc (2 × 15 mL).
The filtrate was evaporated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure,
and the residue was purified by flash chromatography.

vial was sealed with a cap containing a PTFE septum, and the system
was flushed with N2 for 2 min. A nitrogen balloon was attached
to the system through the septum, and the reaction mixture was stirred
at 65°C for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the vial
was opened and an extra amount of IBX (50 mg) was added. The system
was again closed, flushed with N2, and left under stirring
at 65°C overnight. Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with
CH2Cl2, filtered through a short plug of Celite,
and the plug was rinsed with more CH2Cl2 (3
× 15 mL). The solvent was evaporated on a rotary evaporator under
reduced pressure, and the product was purified by flash chromatography.
