To
improve the performance of carbon paper used for applications
such as electrodes for electrochemical devices and air filters, two
types of long carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with average diameters of 20
and 49 nm were prepared by the liquid pulse injection (LPI) technique
by adjusting reaction conditions. Carbon paper was made from the CNFs
through a simple filtration process. The paper prepared from the CNFs
with an average diameter of 20 nm (LPI-CNF(20) paper) was firm
and flexible even though it was prepared without using any binders.
LPI-CNF(20) paper also had a high surface area and showed a high electrical
conductivity and a moderate gas permeability according to its void
size. These properties are required for cathodes in the latest battery
systems such as lithium–air batteries. In electrochemical experiments
conducted to evaluate the performance of LPI-CNF(20) paper as a cathode,
the paper showed a larger discharge capacity on the basis of the cathode
weight than a conventional cathode (a commercially available carbon
paper combined with a porous carbon), which indicated that it has
a high potential to be used as a cathode in lithium–air batteries.

==== Body
Introduction
Carbon papers (CPs) formed from carbon
fibers (CFs) have several
unique properties, such as a high electrical conductivity, a high
mechanical strength, high gas permeability, and high chemical resistance.
Hence, they are often used as current collectors for the latest energy
storage/conversion systems, such as fuel cells and lithium–air
batteries.1−5 When they are used in lithium–air batteries, they are generally
coated with porous carbons using a binder, because their surface area
is too small for surface reactions such as Li2O2 deposition to significantly proceed. In a typical preparation process
of commercially available carbon papers, fibrous precursor polymers,
whose diameters are several micrometers, are casted or woven into
a paper and then the polymer paper is carbonized at a high temperature.6,7 As the surface area of such carbon papers depends on the diameter
of the fibers composing it, it is difficult to increase the surface
area when the diameter of the fibers is large. As a potential method
to produce fibrous carbon precursors with a smaller diameter, the
electrospinning method is known. Through this method, fibers having
diameters from several micrometers to less than 100 nanometers can
be obtained8−10 and such fibers can be easily casted into a paper.
Because carbon fibers obtained from such fibrous polymers without
heat treatment generally have an amorphous structure or a turbostratic
structure,11,12 their electrical conductivity
is considered not to be as high as that of carbons composed of highly
aligned graphene sheets. Therefore, papers constructed from fibrous
carbons with such a highly aligned crystal structure and with a small
diameter are preferable for various applications.

Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) are well-known fibrous carbons with small
diameters and are formed by highly aligned graphene sheets. The diameter
of CNTs is generally below 10 nm, which is much smaller than that
of CFs, and the walls of CNTs are composed of a few layers of stacked
graphene sheets. Because of their unique structure, CNTs have a large
surface area (the theoretical surface area of single-wall CNT is around
1300 m2/g), a high electrical conductivity, and show a
high chemical resistance. When CNTs are casted into a paper, they
can be used as high-performance electrodes in electrochemical devices.13,14 In previous studies of lithium–air batteries, CNT paper showed
a very high discharge capacity when used as a cathode.15

CNTs are generally prepared through chemical
vapor deposition (CVD),
where gaseous carbon sources flow into a heated reactor with metal
nanoparticles located inside; CNTs elongate through the catalysis
of the nanoparticles. In general, metal nanoparticles with appropriate
sizes are supported on a substrate prior to CNT production.16 Although CNTs with small diameters and a highly
aligned crystal structure can be prepared through this method, their
productivity is not so high because this process is basically a noncontinuous
“batch” process. Therefore, CNT paper tends to be extremely
expensive. Generally, the required surface area in electrodes for
various battery systems is not so high.17,18 Therefore,
papers with only moderate surface areas are thought to be preferable,
if they are much more inexpensive than papers produced using CNTs.

To prepare such fibrous carbons, a modified CVD method has been
developed, where the precursor of metal nanoparticles, usually an
organometallic complex like ferrocene, is continuously provided along
with the carbon source into the reactor. The precursor is heated in
the reactor and decomposes, releasing numerous metal atoms. These
metal atoms aggregate and form metal nanoparticles. They contribute
to the formation of primary fibrous carbons, and then carbon layers
are deposited on the catalytically formed primary fibrous carbons
through thermal deposition of the carbon source.19 By using this method, fibrous carbons can be continuously
produced but the diameters of the carbons through this method tend
to be larger than those of CNTs. The diameter of fibrous carbons obtained
through this method is usually several tens of nanometers to several
hundred nanometers, so the fibers are usually called carbon nanofibers
(CNFs). However, it is difficult to prepare CNFs with a high aspect
ratio through this method because the catalyst life of the generated
metal nanoparticles tends to be extremely short. Therefore, the obtained
CNFs are thought not to be suitable for preparing CNF papers due to
their limited aspect ratio. As it is difficult to reduce the diameter
of the resulting CNFs in this method, it is essential to produce longer
CNFs at a high productivity to prepare papers from CNFs.

To
efficiently produce CNFs with long lengths, the liquid pulse
injection (LPI) technique was developed.20−25 In this method, the initial source, which is a mixture of the catalyst
source and the carbon source, is injected as a liquid pulse into a
heated reactor. As soon as the solution makes contact with the heated
wall of the reactor, the pulse is vaporized and the catalyst source
in it instantaneously decomposes, releasing numerous metal atoms,
as heat transfer between the solid wall and the liquid pulse rapidly
proceeds. The metal atoms quickly coagulate and form fine metal nanoparticles.
Fiber growth initiates as the nanoparticles make contact with the
carbon source and reach the appropriate temperature. As this method
enables the generation of highly active nanoparticles in a highly
dense state, a large amount of long and uniform fibers can be produced
at a high yield. Graphene sheets composing the wall of the obtained
CNFs are well arranged in parallel to the axis of the fiber. Therefore,
the CNFs obtained through this method are thought to have a high electrical
conductivity. In addition, the diameter of the CNFs can be easily
controlled, as the amount of thermal deposition of the carbon source
can be regulated by adjusting the initial source composition and the
carrier gas flow rate. The long and thin CNFs prepared through the
LPI technique are expected to be easily castable into the form of
a paper, and the resulting CNF paper is thought to be suitable for
the electrode of batteries due to the high electrical conductivity
of the CNFs which compose it.

In this work, we prepared CNFs
with different diameters through
the LPI technique and prepared paper from them to investigate how
the diameter and length of CNFs affect the properties of the resulting
carbon paper. The evaluated properties were surface area, gas permeability,
and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, to demonstrate its high
potential as an electrode, we conducted discharge tests using the
CNF papers as the cathode in lithium–air batteries.

Results
and Discussion
CNFs with different diameters were prepared
by adjusting reaction
conditions in the LPI technique to investigate the effects of the
thickness of CNF on properties of the CNF paper prepared from them. Figure 1 shows scanning electron
microscope (SEM) images of the two types of LPI-CNFs, commercially
available CNFs and a carbon paper (CP). Note that the commercially
available CNFs and CP were, respectively, chosen as a sample which
has a fiber diameter comparable to that of the LPI-CNFs and a sample
which is generally used for the current collector in batteries. The
diameters of the two types of LPI-CNFs are significantly different,
as shown in Figure 1a,b. Therefore, the diameter of LPI-CNFs was successfully controlled
by shortening the reaction time and by decreasing the concentration
of the carbon source in the initial solution by using methanol as
a diluent, which suppresses the deposition of carbon layers on the
fibers. Their average diameters were calculated using SEM images and
were 49 and 20 nm, respectively. Using these values, the LPI-CNFs
will be denoted as LPI-CNF(49) and LPI-CNF(20) hereafter. As the aspect
ratio of the obtained LPI-CNFs is extremely high, their lengths cannot
be determined from SEM images. The high aspect ratio of the obtained
CNFs can also be indirectly confirmed from the insets shown in Figure 1; the appearance
of the LPI-CNFs is cotton-like, whereas the commercially available
CNFs appear to be of a powder form. The commercially available CNFs
have a diameter similar to that of LPI-CNF (20) (Figure 1c), and therefore the difference
of their appearances suggests that the LPI-CNFs are much longer than
the commercially available CNFs. Figure 1d shows an SEM image of CP. The diameter
of the CFs composing the CP can be determined as ca. 9 μm, which
is much larger than that of CNFs. Considering their smaller diameters,
LPI-CNF(20) and LPI-CNF(49) are expected to show higher surface areas
than those of the CFs composing CP. Therefore, papers prepared from
them are expected to be suitable for the cathode in lithium–air
batteries.

Figure 1 SEM images of (a) LPI-CNF(49), (b) LPI-CNF(20), (c) commercially
available CNFs, and (d) CP. The insets show the morphology of the
samples.

The prepared fibers were casted
into a paper through a filtration
process, where the fibers were first dispersed in toluene and then
simply filtered out using a membrane filter. Figure 2a shows a photograph of a sample prepared
from commercially available CNFs. The sample still looks powdery even
after the filtration process due to the short lengths of the CNFs
used to make it and is easily fractured into pieces even when gently
handled. Figure 2b
shows a photograph of a sample prepared through the filtration process
from LPI-CNF(49). It was also fragile and could not be completely
peeled off from the membrane filter, but its structure was confirmed
to be firmer than that of papers made from commercially available
CNFs because the pealed LPI-CNF(49) was still aggregated in fragments
with dimensions of several millimeters. This suggests that long fibers
contribute to the strengthening of the paper prepared from them but
the entanglements between the fibers are not sufficient to make self-standing
paper. Next, the LPI-CNF(49) samples were reinforced by passing a
poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder solution through them after
filtration. A typical reinforced sample is shown in Figure 2c and will be referred to as
LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper hereafter. LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper was so firm
that it could be pinched with tweezers without falling apart, indicating
that it may have enough strength to be applied to electrodes for batteries.
Paper samples were also prepared from LPI-CNF(20), as shown in Figure 2d. The obtained samples
(LPI-CNF(20) paper) were self-standing even though they were synthesized
without using any binders and could be handled easily without damaging
their structure. This would be because LPI-CNF(20) easily get entangled
with each other due to their diameter and/or their length. Considering
that the difference of the diameters of LPI-CNF(20) and LPI-CNF(49)
is not so large, their length may be significantly different. Moreover,
LPI-CNF(20) paper can be folded without being fractured (Figure 2e), a feature that
even CP (Figure 2f)
does not have. Such a flexible paper is expected to be applicable
to various applications.

Figure 3a,b
shows
N2 adsorption isotherms and pore size distributions of
LPI-CNF(20) paper, LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper, and CP. All of the isotherms
show low uptakes in the low relative pressure region, around P/P0 = 0, which indicates that
the samples hardly have micropores and their surface areas are attributed
mainly to the external surface of fibers. Their Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas (SBET) were calculated
and are listed as shown in Table 1. SBET of CP (0.9 m2/g) is much lower than those of LPI-CNF(20) paper (200 m2/g) and LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper (19 m2/g) because
the diameter of the carbon fibers constructing CP is extremely large.
From the diameters determined from SEM images, the surface areas of
LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper and LPI-CNF(20) paper can be estimated as 43
and 106 m2/g, respectively. Considering the LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF
paper, the difference between the estimated surface area and the BET
surface area is thought to be due to the bundling of fibers and/or
clogging of voids by the binder. Considering the LPI-CNF(20)/PVDF
paper, the BET surface area is larger than the estimated surface area,
which is thought to be due to surface roughness. As only a moderate
surface area is required in cathodes for lithium–air batteries,
it is expected that both LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper and LPI-CNF(20) paper
can be used for this application. Moreover, the N2 uptake
of LPI-CNF(20) paper increased at a high relative pressure of P/P0 ≈ 1, which indicates
that LPI-CNF(20) paper has many voids between the fibers which compose
it, whose sizes are comparable to meso- and macropores, as confirmed
from its pore size distribution shown in Figure 3b. In cathodes for lithium–air batteries,
such meso- and macropores are mainly used for Li2O2 deposition during the discharge process.18,26,27 Hence, a high capacity is expected when
LPI-CNF(20) paper is used as the cathode in lithium–air batteries.

To
utilize CNF papers as a catalyst support used in a flow system,
electrodes for fuel cells, and lithium–air batteries, a moderate
gas permeability is required. Hence, the gas permeability of the obtained
CNF papers were evaluated through air flow experiments. Figure 4 shows the pressure drop that
occurs when air is passed through the CNF papers at different linear
velocities. The data of CP was also measured, but the results are
not shown as the values were negligibly small. LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper
shows a lower resistance than that of LPI-CNF(20) paper. This can
be regarded as a reasonable result because the void size in CNF papers,
which affects the resistance, depends on the diameter of the fibers
that compose it. The size of the voids within the papers were estimated
using the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, as shown in (eq 1). 1  Here, Q is the volumetric
flow rate, R is the radius of the voids, ΔP is the pressure drop, μ is the viscosity of air,
and L is the thickness of the sample. Although this
equation was formularized for cylindrical voids, it can be used to
roughly estimate the size of the voids in CNF papers. The estimated
void diameters of LPI-CNF(20) paper and LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper were
0.41 and 2.1 μm, respectively. The estimated void diameters
are similar to the size of the voids observed in SEM images. This
means that the prepared CNF papers have moderate gas permeabilities
corresponding to their void size. These results also indicate that
the CNF papers have a fairly uniform structure.

The electrical conductivity of materials to be used in electrodes
is extremely important. Therefore, the electrical conductivity of
CNF papers and CP were calculated from I–V plots and the results are shown in Table 1. Considering that the LPI-CNF papers were
simply formed through filtration of preprepared CNFs, connections
based on only physical contact exist between the CNFs that form them.
Because of this, their electrical resistance is concerned to be higher
than that of CP, which is produced by carbonizing a precursor paper
constructed from a fibrous polymer. LPI-CNF(20) paper, however, shows
a very high electrical conductivity comparable to that of CP. This
is thought to be due to two reasons: LPI-CNF(20) is so long, so the
number of highly resistant connecting points can be reduced, and the
electrical conductivity of LPI-CNFs is higher than that of the CFs
constructing CP because fibrous carbons prepared through CVD methods
including LPI-CNFs generally show a high electrical conductivity due
to the well-arranged graphene sheets composing them, even without
an additional heat treatment.28,29 However, the electrical
conductivity of LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper was lower than that of LPI-CNF(20)
paper and CP, whereas the porosities of the three samples are comparable.
This is because the insulating PVDF binder tends to reduce the number
of the electrical paths within the paper. These results show that
LPI-CNF(20) paper has sufficient electrical conductivity to be used
as electrodes in batteries and it can also be used as a current collector
like CP.

To evaluate the performance of LPI-CNF(20) paper as
a cathode for
lithium–air batteries, LPI-CNF(20) paper was electrochemically
tested at a current density of 50 mA/(g-cathode) using a 2032 coin
cell having small holes on the cathode cover, enabling O2 to diffuse into the cell. For comparison, CP and Ketjen black (KB)
coated on CP (CP-KB) were also tested. Figure 5 shows discharge curves of LPI-CNF(20) paper,
CP, and CP-KB. LPI-CNF(20) paper showed a high discharge capacity
of 921 mAh/g, whereas that of CP was only 2.5 mAh/g. This is because
LPI-CNF(20) paper has a high surface area and a moderate volume of
voids where Li2O2 can be deposited. As for CP,
the extremely small surface area hardly contributes to the deposition
of Li2O2 in the discharge process. Because of
this, CP is generally used for the cathode of lithium–air batteries
after being combined with KB to increase the surface area available
for Li2O2 deposition; CP-KB showed a very high
discharge capacity on the basis of the weight of KB (about 6000 mAh/(g-KB)
at 50 mA/(g-KB)). However, the amount of KB that can be loaded on
CP (9.1 mg) is only 1.1 mg, as shown in Table 2, and hence the discharge capacity based
on the cathode weight is not quite large. In Figure 5, the discharge capacity of CP-KB measured
at a current density based on the cathode weight (50 mA/(g-cathode))
is 415 mAh/g, which is smaller than that of LPI-CNF(20) paper. The
areal capacity of LPI-CNF(20) paper was calculated to be 5.5 mAh/cm2, which is larger than that of CP-KB (2.1 mAh/cm2) and is comparable to that of a sheet made of 12 mg of single-walled
CNTs (about 6.5 mAh/cm2@0.4 mA/cm2).15 In addition to these results, LPI-CNF papers
have a high productivity because the LPI-CNFs that are used to synthesize
them can be more efficiently prepared through the LPI technique than
typical CVD methods and the paper itself can be easily synthesized
through a simple filtration process without using any binders. Although
only the initial performance of LPI-CNF(20) paper as a cathode has
been evaluated in this study, the performance should be further improved
by combining it with a suitable porous carbon. Considering their unique
properties, LPI-CNF(20) paper is thought to be a promising material
for being utilized not only in lithium–air batteries but also
in other electrochemical devices.

Conclusions
Two types of CNFs having different average fiber diameters were
separately prepared through the LPI technique by adjusting reaction
conditions. From the LPI-CNFs with an average diameter of 20 nm, self-standing
papers could be prepared through a simple filtration process. The
obtained paper had a firm and flexible structure, with a high surface
area of 200 m2/g, and showed a high electrical conductivity.
Its electrochemical evaluation as a cathode in lithium–air
batteries exhibited that it has a larger discharge capacity based
on the cathode weight than a porous carbon CP. This result suggests
that the LPI-CNF paper can be potentially used as a cathode in lithium–air
batteries without additional porous carbons and binders. Moreover,
considering the features of high surface area, high gas permeability,
and high electrical conductivity, LPI-CNF papers are also expected
to be used for other applications, such as filters for the electrostatic
removal of pollutants from air, catalyst supports, and electrodes
for other electrochemical devices.

Method
Materials

(99.5%), thiophene (97.0%), ferrocene
(98.0%), methanol (99.8%), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 99.0%), and
toluene (99.0%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries.
Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF, KF Polymer #1100) and commercially
available carbon nanofibers were purchased from Kureha Corporation
and Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., respectively. Ketjen black
(EC600JD) was purchased from Lion Specialty Chemicals Co., Ltd. Tetraethylene
glycol dimethylether (TEGDME, 99.0%) and lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate
(99.995%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. Lithium foil
(0.2 mm in thickness, 99.8%) and carbon paper (CP, TGP-H-030) were
purchased from Honjo Metal Corporation and Toray Industries, respectively.

Preparation of CNFs and CNF Papers
CNFs were mainly
prepared according to the literature.30 An initial solution for LPI-CNF(49) was prepared by mixing benzene,
ferrocene, and thiophene at a weight ratio of 94:5:1. The initial
solution for LPI-CNF(20) was a mixture of benzene, ferrocene, thiophene,
and methanol, with a weight ratio of 14:1.5:0.3:84.2. Figure 6 shows the experimental apparatus
used for CNF production. H2 flow rate was set at 409 and
999 cm3/min when preparing LPI-CNF(49) and LPI-CNF(20),
respectively. The reactor was heated until the temperature at its
center position reached 1473 K. At this temperature, 100 μL
of the initial solution was injected into the reactor using a syringe
and the injection was repeated 100 times at an interval of 60 s. After
cooling down to room temperature (RT), the generated CNFs were collected
from the bottom of the reactor.

Figure 6 Experimental apparatus for CNF production.

The obtained CNFs were wetted
with a few drops of NMP and were
kneaded for 3 min using a planetary mixer (AR-100, Thinky). The wet
CNFs were suspended in toluene by ultrasonic irradiation. The suspension,
in which the CNF concentration was 50 wt %, was vacuum-filtered with
a hydrophobic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane (pore size: 0.1 μm,
Advantec). For preparing LPI-CNF(49)/PVDF paper, an excess amount
of 0.01 wt % PVDF/NMP solution was passed through the CNF layer just
after the filtration of the LPI-CNF(49) suspension. The obtained sample
was dried at RT. The areal density of the resulting CNF papers was
approximately 6 mg/cm2.

Characterization
CNFs and CP were observed using a
field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-6500F, JEOL). The
porous structures of the samples were evaluated by N2 adsorption
experiments conducted at 77 K using an adsorption apparatus (BELSORP
mini, BELSORP max, Microtrac BEL). Before adsorption experiments,
the samples were heated under a N2 flow at 523 K for 4
h. The specific surface areas were calculated by applying the BET
method to the obtained N2 adsorption isotherms. Gas permeability
of the paper samples was evaluated by measuring the pressure drop
that occurs when air was passed through the samples. For the measurement
of pressure drops, the paper sample was fixed in a handmade cell,
where the cross-sectional inner diameter was 11 mm. The flow rates
of air were regulated in the range between 100 and 400 cm3/min. In the measurement of electrical conductivities, paper samples
were cut into rectangles (10 mm × 20 mm) and both ends of them
were fixed to current collectors with a conductive paste (Dotite D-500,
Fujikura Kasei). Both ends were connected to a potentiostat (HA-151,
Hokuto Denko). Different voltages were applied between the ends of
the samples, and the resulting currents were measured to obtain I–V plots. From the slope of the I–V plots, the electrical conductivity
of the sample was calculated.

Performance Evaluation
as a Cathode for Lithium–Air Batteries
The performance
of LPI-CNF(20) paper, CP, and CP-KB as a cathode
for lithium–air batteries was evaluated. LPI-CNF(20) paper
and CP were used without modifications. For CP-KB cathode preparation,
KB was mixed with a 12% PVDF solution in NMP at a weight ratio of
19/1 (KB/PVDF) for 3 min using a planetary mixer (AR-100, Thinky).
The obtained mixture was rubbed into CP. The KB-introduced CP was
dried at 388 K under vacuum for 15 h and then punched out into circles
with a diameter of 16 mm using a punching tool. The casted KB weight
on the circular cathode was adjusted to about 1.3 mg.

2032-type
coin cells with small holes in the cathode cap for allowing O2 diffusion were assembled in a glovebox filled with Ar. Lithium
metal, a glass fiber filter (GF/A, Whatman), and a solution of CF3SO3Li in TEGDME (TEGDME/CF3SO3Li = 4:1, molar ratio) were used as the counter electrode, the separator,
and the electrolyte, respectively. The cells were set in a gas-tight
box into which oxygen was supplied at a flow rate of 10 cm3/min. They were discharged until 2.0 V vs Li/Li+ at a
current density of 50 mA/g (0.3 mA/cm2) after 10 h of rest
in an oxygen atmosphere.
