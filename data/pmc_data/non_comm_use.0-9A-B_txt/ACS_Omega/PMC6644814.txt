Vacuum-processed diphenylbis(3-(pyridine-2-yl)phenyl)silane
(2PTPS),
diphenylbis(3-(pyridine-3-yl)phenyl)silane (3PTPS), and diphenylbis(3-(pyridine-4-yl)phenyl)silane
(4PTPS) have been used as electron-transporting host materials combined
with tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine (TCTA) as the hole-transporting
host, which induce balanced charge carrier transport for high-efficiency
phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes. The 4PTPS-based organic
light-emitting diodes with tris[2-phenylpyridinato-C2,N]iridium(III) [Ir(ppy)3] dopant showed highest current efficiency and external quantum efficiency
of 53.54 cd/A and 15.61%, compared to 2PTPS (40.75 cd/A, 11.84%) and
3PTPS (29.35 cd/A, 8.54%). These results were attributed to the well-aligned
structure with preferential horizontal orientation of the emitting
material layer by the diffraction intensity distribution as a function
of azimuthal angle in two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction
analysis. The molecular orientation of TCTA:4PTPS material with a
narrow azimuthal intensity distribution had better priority to the
horizontal direction than the other TCTA:2PTPS and TCTA:3PTPS materials,
which is related to the charge transport as well as the device efficiency.
We found that the preferential horizontal orientation of the co-host
material with a balanced charge carrier was not affected by Ir(ppy)3 dopant with a homoleptic structure and bis-[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C2](picolinato)iridium [Firpic]
dopant with a heteroleptic structure in the co-host/dopant system.

Introduction
The
organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are attracting much attention
because of their advantages, such as self-emissive, flexible, and
low power consumption for next-generation display and lighting applications,
and various studies have been carried out to improving the device
efficiency by the development of both host and dopant materials. The
co-host (or mixed host) materials composed with hole-transporting
(HT) and electron-transporting (ET) materials have been investigated
due to their advantages of high efficiency by balanced charge carriers,
low driving voltage, and controllable carrier mobility.1−6 Blue emitting phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) with single host material
have shown lower external quantum efficiency (EQE) than green, red,
and orange PhOLEDs over 30%, but it reported a high efficiency of
29.5% by using mCP:B3PYMPM as the co-host and bis-[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C2](picolinato)iridium [Firpic]
dopant for horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moment
in 2014.7 The synthesized universal ET
host materials based on tetraphenylsilane with pyridine moieties produced
high EQEs in bis(2-phenylbenzothiozolato-N,C2′)iridium(acetylacetonate) [Bt2Ir(acac)]-based orange-red (∼35.5%), tris[2-phenylpyridinato-C2,N]iridium(III) [Ir(ppy)3]-based green (∼29%), and Firpic-based blue (∼20.9%)
due to high triplet energy (ET) and electron
mobility (μe) in solution-processed PhOLEDs. The
ET host material can align the charge-carrier balance and broaden
the electron–hole recombination zone by using the HT/ET co-host
material in the emitting material layer (EML).8 Recently, some research groups suggested that the investigation
of molecular orientation is known as one of the key factors for high
device efficiency by improving the outcoupling efficiency. It has
been theoretically estimated that the preferential molecular orientation
of the emitters with a horizontal orientation can increase the EQE
by up to 45%, which is higher by about 25–30% than that achieved
by isotropically oriented molecules.9−11 One of the studies on
organic molecular orientation of tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine
(TCTA) with HT property showed different hole mobility and molecular
orientation by different processes, such as the face-to-face π–π
stacking in vacuum process and randomly oriented molecules in solution
process.12 However, most studies on the
molecular orientation of the emitting materials in conventional PhOLEDs
have only been discussed about the dopant orientation with heteroleptic
or homoleptic structure, different linker kinds, and linker positions,
which are identified using indirect analysis methods on device characteristics.
Kim and co-workers have investigated the molecular orientations of
the Ir complexes/Firpic combination with preferred horizontal orientation
in the co-host material. In this group, the effects of intermolecular
interaction between host and dopant molecules on the emitting dipole
orientation (EDO) of dopants are studied by comparison between emitting
dipole distribution and intermolecular binding energies.7,13 The relationships between the molecular structure of Ir complexes
and their EDO, which have different substituted positions of functional
groups, such as strong electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl group,
elongated propyl group, planar, and charge conjugated phenyl group,
were also studied.14 The transition dipole
moments of the films were analyzed from the angle-dependent photoluminescence
(PL) spectra. The Brütting group has investigated various molecular
orientations; for example, three phosphorescent heteroleptic Ir complex
dopants with different orientations of benzopyranopyridinone (bppo)
and 2-phenylpyridinate (ppy) with isotropic dipole orientation, and
acetylacetonate (acac) with relatively horizontal dipole orientation
to the substrate can control the alignment of the emitting molecules
to improving device efficiency.15 The horizontal
orientation of fluorescent emitter Coumarin 6 depends on increase
in the glass transition temperature due to decrease in the molecular
surface mobility during deposition.16 The
different orientations in the evaporated and solution-processed four
different irdium complexes doped host materials were analyzed by the
angular dependent PL analysis or dipole moments calculation using
variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry.17 In another study on molecular orientation, the dipole–dipole
potential of seven Ir complex phosphorescent emitters was strongly
correlated with the transition dipole orientation using the spectral
radiant intensity based on experimental and simulated data.18 The orientation emitters with various dopant
ratios of 0–50 wt % and different dopant molecule structures
in host/dopant system have been investigated by X-ray diffraction
analysis.19

In our previous works,
we first reported the relationship between
device efficiency and molecular orientation on the nondoping fluorescence
OLEDs of different molecular orientations with two linker types through
direct-analysis methods using two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray
diffraction (2D-GIXD) analysis.20 In thermally
activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs, we found that the molecular
orientation of the emitting materials had different horizontal and
random orientations as a function of linker positions of para and
meta, which showed 12.5 times difference of the device efficiency.21 This improved device efficiency was confirmed
by the enhanced out-coupling efficiency of a well-aligned stacking
structure in the EML with a horizontal molecular orientation to in-plane
and out-of-plane analysis using 2D-GIXD.

In this study, we investigated
the relationship between the vacuum-processed
PhOLED properties and the molecular orientations of nPTPS (n = 2, 3, 4) as host materials using 2D-GIXD
analysis in high-efficiency PHOLEDs. The nPTPS ET
host materials have many advantages, such as good morphological stability
and high ET property for balanced charge-carrier transport by pyridyl-substituted
linker in solution-processed PhOLED, as reported in the literature.8 In particular, we analyzed the 2D-GIXD patterns
and the out-of-plane spectra of the co-host and co-host/dopant molecules,
as well as the azimuthal intensity profiles for a plot of orientation
distributions of molecules. The research on preferential orientation
of the host material has been discussed for the first time using 2D-GIXD
analysis, and is believed provide new evidence for identifying the
cause of device efficiency.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a,b show
the chemical structures of the nPTPS composed of
tetrahedral silicon and two meta-pyridine substituents,
as well as two dopant materials. To obtain high device efficiency,
the energy levels of each layer were considered with a balanced charge
carrier, and Figure 1c shows the energy-band diagram of the fabricated PhOLEDs. The near-edge
X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra of the TCTA:nPTPS (n = 2, 3, and 4) films in Figure S1 are assigned to the π* (C=C)
orbital at 284.5 eV, the σ* (C–H) orbital mixed with
Rydberg orbitals around (287–291) eV, and σ* (C–C)
or σ* (C=C) orbitals in the energy range (292–307)
eV (see the Supporting Information). The
tilting angle α between the C=C double bond in the conjugated
planes and the substrate surface with a photon beam size (0.1 mm ×
0.3 mm) were determined. The inset in Figure S1 is the average tilt angle of approximately (55 ± 5)°.

and 4PTPS electron-transporting host materials and (b) Ir(ppy)3 and Firpic dopant materials. (c) Energy-band diagram of PHOLEDs.

The π* resonance intensity
of the TCTA:nPTPS (n = 2, 3, and
4) films shows similar values
with increase in the incidence angle (θ). The crystallinity
as the C=C/C–H ratio of the films is insignificant because
all films have randomly orientated distributions.

For define
the molecular orientations of nPTPS
emitting materials, we analyzed the scattered X-ray intensity in synchrotron
2D-GIXD analysis of co-host (TCTA:nPTPS), co-host/dopants
(TCTA:nPTPS:Ir(ppy)3, or TCTA:nPTPS:Firpic) films with the spectra of out-of-plane (i.e.,
perpendicular to the substrate) scattering to the plane and azimuthal
angle scan (see Figures 2–4). In our previous works, to improve
device efficiency, we focused on the correlation between device efficiency
and molecular orientations as a function of substituent linker positions
using 2D-GIXD analysis with scattered X-ray intensity.20,21 However, it is difficult to distinguish the randomly oriented molecules
in the 2D-GIXD patterns because the amorphous material appears lacking
any special features, compared to polycrystalline (full Debye rings)
or single crystal (dots).22 To define the
molecular orientation distributions on the plane of the films, the
molecular orientation of emitting materials should be investigated
by 2D-GIXD analysis with in-plane or out-of-plane scattering as well
as azimuthal intensity plot. Figure 2a–c show the 2D-GIXD patterns for vacuum-processed
co-host (TCTA:nPTPS) films on SiO2/Si
substrate, respectively. In the 2D-GIXD patterns, qx,y or qz means an in-plane or an out-of-plane
component of the scattering vector, q, respectively. Figure 2a–c show that
all of the 2D-GIXD patterns for the TCTA:nPTPS films
consistently present a weak and broad diffraction peak because vacuum-processed
molecules usually tend to be randomly oriented on the substrate due
to the weak molecular interaction.23Figure 2d shows the out-of-plane
intensity profiles, in which a broad diffraction peak is evident at qz = 1.43 Å–1, induced by vacuum-processed planar TCTA molecules with an amorphous
structure. The planar packing distance (d = 2π/q*) of all the vacuum-processed TCTA:nPTPS
is estimated to be 4.4 Å. It is similar to the face-to-face π–π
stacking distance (d ∼ 3.8 Å) because
of the loosely packed and rough structure of the vacuum-deposited
TCTA molecules with a weak intermolecular interaction.12,24 Additionally, all of the 2D-GIXD patterns of the TCTA:nPTPS films show anisotropic intensity distributions. In particular,
relatively strong diffraction intensity is distributed along the out-of-plane
direction, which implies that the planar packing of the TCTA:nPTPS molecules is preferentially distributed along the
out-of-plane direction. To compare the planar packing distributions
of the TCTA:nPTPS films, Figure 2e shows the diffraction intensity distributions
as a function of azimuthal angle. All of the TCTA:nPTPS molecules present a maximum intensity at χ = 0, indicating
a flat-on orientation. Vacuum-processed TCTA:4PTPS film shows the
narrowest azimuthal intensity distribution, whereas vacuum-processed
TCTA:2PTPS and TCTA:3PTPS present relatively broad azimuthal intensity
distributions. This implies that the TCTA:4PTPS film has more flat-on
orientation compared to TCTA:2PTPS and TCTA:3PTPS, as described in Figure 2f,g. In general,
the flat-on orientation along the out-of-plane directions induces
a fast charge transport due to the formation of delocalized states
by the overlapping of π-orbitals.12 Therefore, the vacuum-processed TCTA:4PTPS shows priority in the
horizontal orientation, compared to TCTA:2PTPS and TCTA:3PTPS.

Figures 3 and 4 shows the 2D-GIXD for
vacuum-processed TCTA:nPTPS:Ir(ppy)3 and
TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic films on SiO2/Si substrate, respectively.
All of the 2D-GIXD patterns for vacuum-processed TCTA:nPTPS:Ir(ppy)3 and TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic also similarly exhibit
anisotropic ring pattern at qz = 1.43 Å–1, which is the same as discussed
in Figure 2 and literature.12,19 In the out-of-plane intensity profiles for TCTA:nPTPS:Ir(ppy)3 (Figure 3e), all films show a weak diffraction peak at qz = 0.75 Å–1, which originates from the diffraction of the (220) plane of Ir(ppy)3.13 The TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic films
show the same feature as the nondoped and Ir(ppy)3-doped
TCTA:nPTPS because the small doping concentration
of 5 wt % does not affect the peak, which originates from the fully
amorphous TCTA (Figure 4e).

Figures 3f and 4f show the
azimuthal intensity plot of the TCTA:nPTPS:Ir(ppy)3 or TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic films. The
full width at half maximum for azimuthal intensity distributions of
TCTA:4PTPS, TCTA:4PTPS:Ir(ppy)3, and TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic
are estimated as 99.4, 71.6, and 89° by Gaussian model fitting,
respectively. The co-host/dopant molecules of TCTA:4PTPS:Ir(ppy)3 and TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic shows a slightly increased flat-on
orientation, compared with the host/host molecule of TCTA:4PTPS film.
The enhanced flat-on orientation in the co-host/dopant molecule probably
arises from the slight increase in the intermolecular interaction
by the addition of a dopant because the linear binding geometry of
the co-host/dopant molecule with a larger binding energy more strongly
causes the bound molecules to align horizontally along the substrate
than in the host/host or dopant/dopant system.13 Similar to the TCTA:4PTPS film, the TCTA:4PTPS:Ir(ppy)3 and TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic films showed the strongest and the
narrowest intensity distributions near χ = 0°, implying
a higher flat-on orientation than Ir(ppy)3 or Firpic-doped
TCTA:2PTPS and TCTA:3PTPS films. The results of the 2D-GIXD analysis
show that the predominant features of the molecular orientation in
the host/host (TCTA:nPTPS) and/or co-host/dopant
(TCTA:nPTPS:Ir(ppy)3 or TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic)
systems are not affected by the homoleptic Ir(ppy)3 or
heteroleptic Firpic dopant with an almost isotropic emitting dipole
orientation, as described in Figures 3f,g or 4f,g. It can be proposed
that the orientation of the host material determines the preferential
orientation in the EML.

To compare the orientation ratio between nPTPS
molecules, the parameters of the crystal orientation factor to a set
of hkl planes were calculated using the equation
⟨cos2 ϕ⟩hkl for a set of hkl planes and Herman’s
orientation function f2,25 and Tables 1, 2, and 3 summarize the parameters. The orientation parameter ⟨cos2 ϕ⟩hkl with
azimuthal angle ϕ has the value of unity, and the parameter f2 of Herman’s orientation function is
used to describe the degree of orientation. The f2 values of the emitting materials in co-host or co-host/dopant
systems are close to 0.1, whereas the films with 4PTPS host have relatively
higher values than 2PTPS or 3PTPS. This means that the orientation
of 4PTPS is mostly parallel to the reference direction because f2 is unity when the normal of the reflection
plane is parallel to the reference direction, when value zero is random
orientation and −0.5 is perpendicular to the reference direction.25

The
vacuum-processed Ir(ppy)3-doped devices show similar
current–density curves and high luminance of 23 630,
11 040, and 22 950 cd/m2 in 2PTPS, 3PTPS,
and 4PTPS emitters, respectively, as shown in Figure 5a,b. Among them, the current efficiency (CE)
and EQE of the Ir(ppy)3-doped 4PTPS device shows the highest
values of 53.54 cd/A and 15.61%, respectively, compared with the devices
with 2PTPS (40.75 cd/A, 11.84%) and 3PTPS (29.35 cd/A, 8.54%), as
shown in Figure 5c,d.
The highest efficiencies of the TCTA:4PTPS:Ir(ppy)3 device
can be explained by the following effects: (i) as calculated in literature,
the solution-processed nPTPS host materials have
a higher μe of ∼10–4 cm2/(V s) in the order of 4PTPS < 3PTPS < 2PTPS than the
2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) electron-transporting layer (ETL)
with μe of ∼10–5 cm2/(V s), but it has different device structure compared with
our vacuum-processed device.8 In Ir(ppy)3-doped devices, the higher ET of
2PTPS (2.82 eV), 3PTPS (2.82 eV), and 4PTPS (2.90 eV) host materials
than Ir(ppy)3 (∼2.4 eV) dopant, nPTPS can prevent reverse energy transfer from the dopant to the host.
(ii) From the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of 2PTPS (−6.47,
−2.41 eV), 3PTPS (−6.50, −2.30 eV), and 4PTPS
(−6.55, −2.27 eV), the proper exciton recombination
of 4PTPS might be explained as the hole-blocking effect due to the
deep HOMO level of 4PTPS, which effectively confines carriers within
the emitting layer.26 (iii) The preferential
orientation of the 4PTPS host material has a higher flat-on orientation
with strong and narrow intensity distributions in the azimuthal intensity
plot compared with 2PTPS and 3PTPS host materials, as shown in Figures 2–4.

and (d) quantum-efficiency versus applied voltage of the vacuum-processed
TCTA:nPTPS:Ir(ppy)3 devices.

To confirm the preferential host orientation, the
vacuum-processed
Firpic-doped devices with a heteroleptic structure were investigated
and shown to have similar tendency as the Ir(ppy)3-doped
devices with a homoleptic structure, as shown in Figure 6. The device with TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic
showed similar current–density curves and higher luminance,
CE, and EQE (7874 cd/m2, 11.08 cd/A, and 5.95%) compared
with 2PTPS (5835 cd/m2, 6.2 cd/A, and 3.15%) and 3PTPS
(4130 cd/m2, 6.52 cd/A, and 3.41%) devices. The featured
device performance in TCTA:4PTPS:Firpic is believed to be due to the
priority of the host molecular orientation to the horizontal direction,
and we found that the preferential orientation was not affected by
Firpic or Ir(ppy)3 dopants.

Conclusions
By comparing the 2D-GIXD analysis and device
characteristics, the
preferential host orientation to the horizontal direction in the emitting
material can be one of the main factors for improving device efficiency,
and, in particular, priority of the host material was not affected
by the dopant materials with a homoleptic or a heteroleptic structure.
The Ir(ppy)3- and Firpic-doped TCTA:4PTPS devices with
a preferential horizontal orientation showed highest CE and EQE due
to balanced hole and electron recombination in the EML with the well-aligned
stacking structure in the horizontal direction, compared with 2PTPS
and 3PTPS materials with a relatively random orientation. This correlation
between the preferential orientation of charge-balanced HT-host/ET-host
material and device characteristics can contribute to device efficiency
and useful molecule design of emitting materials.

Experimental
Details
Materials
nPTPS (n = 2, 3, and 4) were synthesized in Gyeonsang National University,
and detailed synthetic procedures are given in the literature.8 We used Ir(ppy)3 and Firpic dopants
with sublimed grade (>99.7%) from Ossila. The 4,4′-cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)benzenamine] (TAPC),
TCTA, and 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) of sublimed grade (>99.5%) were
purchased from Lumtec Co.

Microstructure Analysis and Device Characterization
Near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and 2D-GIXD
measurements
were, respectively, carried out using the 4D and 9A U-SAXS beamline
of the Pohang Light Source (PLS-II) in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory.
Detailed X-ray measurement procedures are given in the literature.20,21 Electrical and optical characteristics of PhOLEDs were measured
by the Keithley 236 source meter unit and CS-1000 (Konica Minolta
Co.) spectroradiometer.

Device Fabrication
The indium tin
oxide-coated glass
substrates were used as anode, cleaned with deionized water, acetone,
and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min using an ultrasonic bath, and dried
in the oven for 1 day. Before device fabrication, the substrate was
treated under O2 plasma for 60 s. In our vacuum process,
molbdenum oxide (MoO3, 5 nm) and TAPC (70 nm) were used
as hole-injection and -transporting materials. Ir(ppy)3 and Firpic dopants were relatively co-evaporated with 5 wt % ratio
during the EML deposition. TPBi (30 nm), 8-hydroxyquinolatolithium
(Liq, 1 nm), and aluminum (Al, 120 nm) were continuously evaporated
and used as ETL, interlayer, and cathode, respectively.
