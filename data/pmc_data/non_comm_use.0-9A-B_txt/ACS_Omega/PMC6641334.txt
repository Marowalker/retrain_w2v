Bulk
polymer-derived ceramic (PDC) composites of SiCO with an embedded
graphene network were produced using graphene-coated poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA) foams as templates. The pyrolysis of green bodies containing
cross-linked polysiloxane, PVA foams, and graphene oxide (GO) resulted
in the decomposition of PVA foams, compression of GO layers, and formation
of graphitic domains adjacent to GO within the SiCO composite, leading
to SiCO composites with an embedded graphene network. The SiCO/GO
composite, with about 1.5% GO in the ceramic matrix, offered an increase
in the electrical conductivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude
compared to that of pure SiCO ceramics. Additionally, the unique graphene
network in the SiCO demonstrated a drop in the observed thermal conductivity
of the composite (∼0.8 W m–1 K–1). Young’s modulus of the as-fabricated SiCO/GO composites
was found to be around 210 MPa, which is notably higher than the reported
values for similar composites fabricated from only ceramic precursors
and PVA foams. The present approach demonstrates a facile and cost-effective
method of producing bulk PDC composites with high electrical conductivity,
good thermal stability, and low thermal conductivity.

1 Introduction
Silicon-based
polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) based on the pyrolysis
of polymeric precursors were first demonstrated in the 1960s and have
since gained momentum in the materials research community due to their
ease of fabrication, highly tailorable nano- and microstructures,
and unique material properties.1−7 The polymer-to-ceramic conversion process has demonstrated easy
integration of functional groups into the ceramic material. Additionally,
the polymeric precursors enable materials to be formed using common
polymer-processing strategies such as extrusion, blow molding, injection
molding, and spin-coating.8−12 Utilizing such techniques, ceramics in the forms of fibers,13,14 porous materials,15−17 and membrane coatings18,19 have been
fabricated, which are otherwise known to be difficult or even impossible
to obtain through conventional routes. Common polymeric precursors
used for PDC fabrication include oligosilazanes and polysiloxanes,
both of which demonstrate a unique nanostructure, leading to the observed
material properties. Typically, nanodomains of Si3N4 or SiO2 surrounded by carbon nanodomains are found
within the structure of an oligosilazane- or polysiloxane-based PDC,
respectively.1,7,20−22 This type of nanostructure has offered PDCs various
attractive material properties such as low density, high-temperature
thermomechanical properties, high piezo resistivity, and chemical/thermal
stability.20,21,23,24 Applications of such PDCs have been found
in micro-electro-mechanical systems,25−27 energy storage devices,12,28−30 and high-temperature sensors.31−34

Whereas many applications
require materials with a high electrical
conductivity, PDCs possess a low electrical conductivity of 10–12–10–4 S cm–1 due to their semiconductive characteristics.35,36 Adding conductive components such as carbon nanotubes,20,37−39 carbon fibers,40 carbon
black,41,42 graphite flakes,43 reduced graphene oxide (GO),44,45 and metal salts46,47 into an insulating PDC matrix can effectively increase the electrical
conductivity of the PDC-based composites. In addition, introducing
percolated networks of conductive materials into PDC composites is
found to be a highly effective method of increasing the electrical
conductivity.48−50 For example, additions of embedded graphene aerogels
were reported to be able to increase the electrical conductivity of
composites to 1.57 S cm–1.49

Here, we report the introduction of conductive percolated
graphene
oxide (GO) networks into bulk PDC composites through a facile templating
method, where polysiloxane is infiltrated into GO-coated poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) foams to produce the green bodies used for pyrolysis.
PVA foams provided a continuous network to support GO and served as
a sacrificial component that decomposed during pyrolysis, leading
to a GO network embedded in SiCO PDCs. The impact of the percolated
GO networks on the preparation of bulk PDC composites, graphitic domain
formation, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity is investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 illustrates
the fabrication process of SiCO/GO composites. The graphene network
was obtained by immersing the preshaped PVA foam into a GO–ethanol
dispersion where GO flakes were deposited onto PVA foam walls. The
liquid SiCO precursor (SILRES 62C) was filled into the voids of the
PVA foam and cross-linked to produce SILRES 62C/GO/PVA green bodies.
The PVA foam was decomposed during the pyrolysis, which led to different
shapes of SiCO/GO composites with a continuous GO network.

Scheme 1 Schematic
Illustration of the Preparation of GO Network Embedded
PDC Composites
The GO used in this
study is a commercially available multilayered
graphene oxide produced through ball-milling with hydrogen peroxide.
The edges of the GO flakes are functionalized with hydroxyl, carbonyl,
and carboxylate groups, and the oxygen content is reported to be about
5 wt %. The GO flakes have sizes below 1 μm (Figure 1a), with the average size of
flakes used in this work being around 350 nm, as measured from dynamic
light scattering (DLS) (Figure S1). Figure 1b clearly shows the
multilayer structure of GO. Additionally, four sets of 6-fold selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns circled in Figure 1c indicate the existence of
the stacked multilayer graphitic structure in GO.52−54 The arcs in
the SAED image corresponding to spacings of 2.10 and 1.23 nm are attributed,
respectively, to the (1100) and (1120) lattice fringes of graphitic
structures randomly oriented in GO flakes.55−57 The typical
thickness of GO flakes is found to be around 8 nm from the atomic
force microscopy (AFM) height profile (Figure S2), suggesting that GO flakes have about eight layers of stacked
graphene.

(c) SAED pattern of GO flakes. Four sets of 6-fold SAED pattern regarding
the (1100) lattice fringe of graphitic structures are labeled in red,
blue, green, and purple circles. (d) Raman spectrum of GO flakes.
The positions of the G peak, D peak, and two-dimensional (2D) peak
are at 1563.8, 1343.9, and 2693.6 cm–1, respectively.

The Raman spectrum verifies the
existence of graphitic domains
in the GO flakes due to the presence of the characteristic G, D, and
2D peaks at 1563.8, 1343.9, and 2693.6 cm–1, respectively
(Figure 1d). The intensity
ratio between the D peak and the G peak is 0.39, which is much smaller
than that for GO synthesized from Hummer’s method (0.9–1.9).58−61 The intensity ratio of the D peak and the G peak is related to the
ratio between sp3 carbon and sp2 carbon. A smaller
value of the intensity ratio reflects a higher percentage of sp2 carbon in the samples (i.e., more ordered graphitic structures
with fewer defects). Therefore, GO is observed to have a more ordered
crystalline structure than GO synthesized by Hummer’s method.
The graphitic structure along the basal plane of the GO flakes yield
GO with electrical conductivities of around 10 S cm–1, which are much higher than that of GO synthesized from Hummer’s
method (∼4 × 1010 Ω sq–1).62 Meanwhile, the functional groups
on the edges facilitate the dispersity of GO in solvents such as ethanol,
acetone, and water, making GO an excellent candidate for solution-based
processing. It should be noted that ethanol is the best medium to
disperse this GO, which can be attributed to the abundance of hydroxyl
groups on the edges of the GO flakes. Therefore, ethanol was used
as the dispersant for GO in the preparation of the PDC composites.

GO flakes were attached to the surface of PVA networks through
van der Waals interaction when the PVA foams were immersed into GO–ethanol
dispersions. Figure 2a,b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PVA foams
covered by GO. High-magnification SEM images (Figure 2b) show the excellent coverage of GO on the
PVA foam walls compared to the SEM image of bare PVA foam (Figure S3).

Figure 2 SEM images of (a, b) GO-attached PVA foams
after the immersion
of PVA foams in the GO dispersion, (c, d) SILRES 62C/GO/PVA composite
green bodies, and (e, f) SiCO/GO composites obtained from SILRES 62C/GO/PVA
composites pyrolyzed at 1000 °C.

The GO-coated PVA foams were filled with the polymeric precursor
in a vacuum environment and then cured at 160 °C to obtain the
green bodies for pyrolysis. The vacuum-assisted SiCO precursor infiltration
produced the fully dense green bodies (Figure 2c) by removing the trapped air between the
PVA foam and the SiCO precursor. The thickness of GO-coated PVA foam
networks within the green bodies is around 10–25 μm,
as seen from Figure 2d.

The green bodies were pyrolyzed at 1000 °C to produce
SiCO/GO
composites. The linear shrinkage of the composites after pyrolysis
at 1000 °C is 22–24% compared to that of green bodies
(Figure S6). The cross-sectional area of
the PDC composites shows the interface between the GO component and
the SiCO matrix (Figure 2e,f). The breakage of the SiCO/GO composites happens at the interface
due to the poor interactions between the matrix and graphitic domains.
It is interesting to notice that the thickness of the GO component
is less than 2 μm, suggesting that the PVA was decomposed during
pyrolysis. The SEM images of the cross section (Figure 2e,f) and the surface (Figure S7) of SiCO/GO composites indicate the formation of
fully dense SiCO/GO composites due to the successful infiltration
of SILRES 62C and complete PVA decomposition. In contrast, SiCO samples
pyrolyzed from pure cross-linked SILRES 62C have obvious cracks due
the stresses generated in the pyrolysis process. We believe that the
embedded GO network plays two roles in producing crack-free PDC composites:
(1) providing channels to release the gas produced by the pyrolysis
of SILRES 62C and decomposition of PVA and (2) functioning as a scaffold
to hold together the SiCO matrix. The measured Young’s moduli
of the bulk fully dense SiCO/GO composites pyrolyzed at 1000 °C
have an average value of 213.4 MPa (Table S2). In comparison, bulk SiCN ceramics produced from oligosilazane
using poly(vinyl alcohol) sponges as templates63 have a low strength (80 MPa) due to 10% pores in the ceramic.
The higher strength of the SiCO/GO composites observed in the current
study is likely attributed to lower porosity.

The mass change
of SILRES 62C/GO/PVA composites and each component
in the PDC composites (i.e., PVA, SILRES 62C precursor, and GO) during
pyrolysis was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA).
The TGA curves in Figure 3 show the mass loss of materials from room temperature to
1000 °C. The thermal decomposition of PVA foam causes a dramatic
mass loss from 300 to 350 °C, and only 4% of the original mass
remains at 1000 °C. On the contrary, the mass of GO remains nearly
constant through the heating process. The minimal mass loss at 100–150
°C is due to the evaporation of residual moisture, with 96% of
its original mass remaining at 1000 °C. The major mass loss in
the SILRES 62C decomposition happens from 300 to 800 °C, and
around 75% of its original mass remains at 1000 °C. This mass
loss is primarily attributed to the decomposition of organic components
in SILRES 62C during the heat treatment. The breakage of Si–H
bonds and Si–C bonds in the polymeric precursors leads to a
release of gases such as methane and hydrogen.64−68 The major mass loss of the green body composite is
in the temperature ranging from 200 to 800 °C, and about 63%
of its original mass remains at 1000 °C. These TGA studies suggest
that most of the PVA decomposed with a minimal loss of the GO during
pyrolysis. The loading percentage of GO in SiCO/GO composites is then
calculated from the density of each component and is found to be around
1.4–1.9 wt % (density of composites ∼1.76 g cm–3, Table S3; GO 1.8 g cm–3 and pure SiCO 1.768 g cm–3, Table S4).

Figure 3 TGA curves of the SILRES 62C/GO/PVA composite and each
component
in the composite.

The elemental compositions
of SiCO/GO composites obtained at different
pyrolysis temperatures were investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) (Table 1). The atomic percentage of carbon decreases as the pyrolysis
temperature increased, corresponding to the decomposition of the organic
components into carbon-containing gases such as methane and ethane.69 At the same time, the atomic ratio between silicon
and oxygen in ceramic composites is around 0.5 during the entire pyrolysis
process, suggesting the existence of SiO2 clusters in SiCO
ceramics, which is in accordance with the observation of the structural
evolution of PDCs in previous reports.35,70,71 The dissociation energy of the Si–O bond (452
kJ mol–1) is higher than that of the C–C
bond (346 kJ mol–1), Si–C bond (318 kJ mol–1), and Si–H bond (319 kJ mol–1) in the composites.72 Therefore, SiO2 clusters are the dominant component in SiCO ceramics. However,
the hydrogen contents in composites cannot be monitored by EDS, but
it is believed that the hydrogen contents decrease by applying higher
pyrolysis temperatures due to the decomposition of Si–H bonds.

In this
study, Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the generation
of the graphitic domains within pure SILRES 62C, SILRES 62C/GO composites,
and SILRES 62C/GO/PVA composites at different temperatures. It has
been reported that graphene facilitates the formation of graphitic
domains in PDCs during pyrolysis.49Figure 4a shows that SILRES
62C pyrolyzed at or above 800 °C shows the G peak and the D peak,
which are the signature Raman peaks of graphitic domains in Raman
spectra. Although GO itself has Raman signals originating from the
graphitic domains (Figure 1d), it is interesting to note that SILRES 62C/GO composites
pyrolyzed below 700 °C show no discernible G or D peaks (Figure 4b). It is believed
that low GO concentration in the composites makes them undiscernible
in the Raman spectra of SILRES 62C/GO composites pyrolyzed below 700
°C. Therefore, the signature G and D peaks in the Raman spectra
of SILRES 62C/GO composites pyrolyzed at or above 700 °C are
not attributed to the GO component, but to the graphitic domains generated
from the pyrolysis of SILRES 62C precursor. Furthermore, the G peaks
shift from 1586.4 to 1614.7 cm–1 when the pyrolysis
temperature increased from 700 to 1000 °C. The blue shift (28.3
cm–1) of the G peaks indicates the effective transition
from amorphous carbon to graphitic domains in composites during pyrolysis.73,74 Similarly, the G peak and the D peak appear in the Raman spectra
of SILRES 62C/GO/PVA composites pyrolyzed at and above 700 °C
(Figure 4c). The blue
shift of the G band (3.9 cm–1) of the SILRES 62C
samples is much smaller than that of the pyrolyzed SILRES 62C/GO composites
(23.1 cm–1) and SILRES 62C/GO/PVA composites (28.3
cm–1) (Table S5). Therefore,
GO-coated PVA foams are shown to facilitate the formation of graphitic
domains in the composites. During the pyrolysis of preceramic polymers,
carbon atoms are produced between SiO2 domains, which can
crystallize into graphitic domains. If graphene is presented in the
matrix, the transition of carbon atoms generated in the area close
to graphene may have different values of the thermodynamic variables
of state, which could lead to a reduction of crystallization activation
energy and an overall lowering crystallization temperature.

with 2 wt % GO, and (c) SILRES 62C/GO/PVA composites pyrolyzed at
different temperatures.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were conducted
to
investigate the composition evolution during the pyrolysis process.
Because the transition to graphitic carbon in the composites happened
at around 700 °C, as indicated by both SEM imaging and Raman
spectroscopy, XPS study was focused on the composition change at 700
°C. The XPS peaks at the carbon and silicon binding energy regions
are presented in Figure 5. The XPS peaks of the composites pyrolyzed at 700 °C have a
small red shift at the carbon region compared to those of the green
body sample, indicating the formation of graphitic “free carbon”
domains.75−77 Deconvoluted XPS spectrum at the carbon region for
the composites pyrolyzed at 1000 °C shows a peak with the binding
energy of 284.6 eV, suggesting the formation of graphitic domains.
On the contrary, the XPS peak in the silicon region shifts to a lower
energy region when the composites were pyrolyzed at 700 °C and
further shifts to a lower energy region when the composites were pyrolyzed
at 1000 °C. The breakage of Si–C bond and Si–H
bond decreases the valance of the silicon element in the composites
and leads to the observed shift of the silicon XPS peak to the lower
energy region. Therefore, the silicon shift can be correlated to the
decomposition of the organic component.

composites at (a) carbon region and (b)
silicon region before pyrolysis (room temperature), at the transition
state of pyrolysis (700 °C), and after pyrolysis (1000 °C).

To understand the effect of graphitic
domains on the electrical
conductivity of SiCO/GO composites produced from SILRES 62C/GO/PVA,
the electrical conductivities of the samples obtained at different
pyrolysis temperatures were measured at room temperature (25 °C)
(Figure 6). The composites
obtained below 300 °C show electrical resistance beyond the measurement
range even with embedded conductive GO networks. The charge accumulation
on the bare samples in SEM studies also illustrates their low electrical
conductivity (Figure S8). However, the
electrical conductivity increased significantly when the pyrolysis
temperature was above 300 °C due to the removal of functional
groups from GO.78 The electrical conductivity
of the composites pyrolyzed at the temperature ranging from 300 to
600 °C increased with higher pyrolysis temperatures. Such an
increase was not caused by the formation of graphitic domains in composites
because the Raman study showed that the formation of conductive graphitic
domains in the SILRES 62C precursor only happened above 700 °C.
It is also interesting to note that the electrical conductivity increment
slope in Figure 6 is
similar to the increase slope of linear shrinkage of the composites.
Therefore, we believe that the increase of electrical conductivity
of composites pyrolyzed between 300 and 600 °C was caused by
the shrinkage of the composites, which pushed the graphene sheets
closer to each other, facilitating easier charge transport. Furthermore,
the electrical conductivity of composites pyrolyzed above 700 °C
continued to increase, whereas the shrinkage of the samples diminished.
The increased electrical conductivity in this temperature range was
attributed to the formation of graphitic carbons in ceramic matrices.
It is important to note that the SiCO/GO composites obtained at 1000
°C are very stable at high temperature in air, as shown in Scheme 2 and the video.

The

is 5 mm × 5 mm × 40 mm.

The electrical
conductivity of GO ceramic composites produced from
pyrolyzing SILRES 62C/GO/PVA green bodies at 1000 °C (∼1
S cm–1) is much higher than that of the recently
reported SiCO/graphene composite paper (0.05 S cm–1).28 Moreover, it is much higher than
the calculated electrical conductivity (∼0.19 S cm–1) using various models by considering the electrical conductivity
of GO (∼10 S cm–1), SiCO matrix (1.8 ×
10–5 S cm–1), and the concentration
of GO (∼1.4–1.9%) (see the Supporting Information).79−82 We believe that the higher observed electrical conductivity is attributed
to the formation of percolated graphitic domains guided by the GO
network (Figure S9). Scheme 3 illustrates the graphitic domains formed
in composites during pyrolysis. The formation of such graphitic domains
in the composites follows two mechanisms, namely, self-crystallization
(Scheme 3a) and GO-induced
crystallization (Scheme 3b,c). The self-crystallization process generates graphitic domains
when pure SILRES 62C was pyrolyzed (Scheme 3a). The abundance of graphitic domains increases
with increased pyrolysis temperatures, as demonstrated by Raman spectroscopic
analysis (Figure 4c).
The electrical conductivity of SiCO obtained at 1000 °C was around
1.8 × 10–5 S cm–1. Both self-crystallization
and GO-induced crystallization happened when SILRES 62C/GO was pyrolyzed
(Scheme 2b). The abundance
of graphitic domains within the matrix increases with increasing pyrolysis
temperatures while GO induces the formation of graphitic domains from
the surface of GO flakes. However, the contribution to the overall
electrical conductivity (8.7 × 10–4 S cm–1) is limited because graphene is randomly dispersed
in the SiCO matrix (Figure S10). Both self-crystallization
and GO-induced crystallization happened when SILRES 62C/GO/PVA composites
were pyrolyzed (Scheme 2c). Because the GO has formed a network in the matrix, the graphitic
domains produced on GO networks greatly enhanced the electrical conductivity
(1 S cm–1). Although SiCO/GO composites produced
from SILRES 62C/GO and SILRES 62C/GO/PVA have similar amounts of GO,
the electrical conductivity of SiCO/GO produced from SILRES 62C/GO/PVA
is much higher due to the GO network formed on PVA foams.

the Pyrolysis Processes
Investigation of the thermal conductivity of SiCO/GO composites
showed that embedded GO had a negative impact on the thermal conductivity.
The SiCO/GO composite pyrolyzed at 1000 °C has a thermal conductivity
of 0.7654 ± 0.1091 and 0.8676 ± 0.1289 W m–1 K–1 at room temperature (25 °C) and at 300
°C, respectively. The thermal conductivity of SiCO/GO composites
is much lower than the reported thermal conductivity of pure SiCO
(1.5–3 W m–1 K–1).83,84 The observed decrease in thermal conductivity is probably due to
the increase in phonon scattering sites at ceramic/GO interfaces when
GO is embedded into the composites.85 Although
the in-plane thermal conductivity of graphene is among the highest
of any known material at around 2000–4000 W m–1 K–1,86,87 the obtained thermal
conductivity is still heavily dependent on substrates and defects.
The mechanism of reduction of thermal conductivity by GO is currently
under investigation.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
bulk SiCO/GO composites are produced using GO-coated
PVA foams as templates. The embedded GO network enables the production
of crack-free PDC composites by providing channels to release the
gas produced in the pyrolysis and scaffolds to hold together the SiCO
matrix. The GO networks in the composites greatly increase the electrical
conductivity by providing effective pathways for electron transport,
facilitated by the formation of conductive graphitic domains in the
ceramic matrix. It is interesting to find that the GO network has
a negative impact on the thermal conductivity of SiCO/GO composites,
which is likely due to an increase in phonon scattering at the interfaces.
Understanding the mechanism of high electrical conductivity and low
thermal conductivity in bulk SiCO/GO composites is important in their
applications as thermal insulator, energy sources, and high-temperature
sensors. The reported method provides a facile and effective approach
to produce bulk PDC composites with multiple functions.

4 Experimental Procedure
4.1 Materials
The
polysiloxane precursor
(SILRES 62C, Wecker), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) foam (Sponge King),
Pyro-Duct 597-A conductive adhesive (Aremco), ethanol (Fisher), and
copper wire (Fisher) were used as received. Argon was purchased from
Air Liquide and used without further purification. Edge functionalized
graphene oxide (GO) is a few layers of graphene oxide from Garmor
Inc. with functional groups such as hydroxyls, carbonyls, and carboxylic
acids found only on the edges of the graphene flakes. These functional
groups enable good dispersity of GO in solvents such as ethanol, acetone,
and water. Meanwhile, the electrical conductivity of this kind of
GO (∼10 S cm–1) is much higher than those
synthesized from Hummer’s method, which are considered as insulators.
This difference is attributed to retaining the graphitic structure
along the basal plane of the GO flakes, which facilitates charge transport
by interplane hopping among GO flakes.

4.2 Materials
Synthesis
4.2.1 Preparation of SiCO/GO Composites from SILRES
62C/GO/PVA Composites
A mixture containing 700 mg of GO and
100 mL of ethanol was sonicated (Branson digital sonifer equipped
with stainless steel tips) for 30 min to obtain a homogenous GO dispersion.
Preshaped PVA foams were immersed into the GO dispersion for 2 h.
The GO-coated PVA foams were then heated in a vacuum oven at 50 °C
for 12 h to completely evaporate the residual ethanol within PVA foams.
The dried PVA foams were immersed in the SILRES 62C precursor under
vacuum for 12 h to ensure that all voids were filled with the precursor.
The filled samples were heated at 160 °C for 16 h to cross-link
the polysiloxane, followed by pyrolysis of this green body (i.e.,
cross-linked composite). In a typical pyrolysis process, the green
bodies were pyrolyzed in a Lindberg Blue M Furnace equipped with a
one inch quartz tube following a heating schedule of 2 h at each 300,
400, 600, and 1000 °C. The ramping rate for all heating steps
was 1 °C min–1, and the composites were allowed
to cool naturally after pyrolysis. The whole pyrolysis process was
conducted in argon atmosphere. To study the composition evolution
of ceramic composites during pyrolysis processes, composites with
different final pyrolysis temperatures (300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800,
and 900 °C) were obtained. The details of the pyrolysis conditions
are summarized in Table S1.

4.2.2 Preparation of SiCO/GO Composites from SILRES
62C/GO Composites
A mixture containing SILRES 62C and GO
of a mass ratio of 50:1 was sonicated by a horn sonifer for 30 min.
After sonication, the mixture was poured into cylinder-shaped molds
made from aluminum foil. The filled molds were heated in an oven at
160 °C for 16 h to cross-link the precursor. After peeling the
aluminum foil off of the cured samples, the samples were taken through
the same pyrolysis procedure as described above for the SILRES 62C/GO/PVA
ceramic composites. Similarly, SILRES 62C/GO ceramic composites with
different final pyrolysis temperatures (300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800,
900, and 1000 °C) were prepared to study the evolution of the
ceramic structure. These composites have GO randomly dispersed in
SiCO matrices.

4.2.3 Preparation of SiCO Ceramics
from Pure SILRES
62C
The liquid SILRES 62C precursor was poured into molds
made from aluminum foil and placed in an oven at 160 °C for 16
h to cross-link the precursor. After removing the aluminum foil, the
cross-linked SILRES 62C samples were pyrolyzed at different final
pyrolysis temperatures (300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000
°C) using the same pyrolysis conditions stated in the previous
two sections.

4.3 Characterization
4.3.1 Measurement of Electrical Conductivity
Electrical resistance
was measured across the two ends of cylinder-shaped
samples using an electrochemistry workstation (CH Instruments). The
resistance was then used to calculate the electrical conductivity.
The resistance of each sample was measured three times for error analysis.

4.3.2 Measurement of Thermal Conductivity
The
thermal conductivities of the samples were calculated from eq 1, where κ is the
thermal conductivity (W m–1 K–1), α is the thermal diffusivity (m2 s–1), Cp is the specific heat capacity (J
kg–1 K–1), and ρ is the
density (kg m–3).51 1  The thermal diffusivity was measured using
the laser flash method (FlashLine 5000 by Anter Corporation). Disks
with a 12.5 mm diameter and 1–2 mm thickness were made from
the PDC composites before and after pyrolysis at 1000 °C. To
make the disks opaque to the laser radiation, they were sputter coated
with ∼15 nm platinum (Pt) followed by coating with a graphite
aerosol spray. Specific heat capacity was measured separately by using
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, TA Instruments). About 10
mg of the PDC composites before and after pyrolysis at 1000 °C
was used in the DSC tests. The ramping rate was 5 °C min–1 with scanning temperatures ranging from 10 to 170
°C for green bodies and 10 to 350 °C for pyrolyzed PDC composites.
The acquired endothermal curves were used to calculate heat capacities
at specific temperatures (Figure S11).

4.3.3 Measurement of Linear Shrinkage
Linear
shrinkage was obtained by measuring the change of dimension
from multiple cylinder-shaped samples after pyrolysis processes at
different temperatures.

4.3.4 Measurement of Young’s
Modulus
Young’s moduli of the composites were acquired
by an Instron
50 kN Electromechanical Load Frame Universal Testing Machine at room
temperature. For the test, 20 mm × 20 mm samples of the SILRES
62C/GO/PVA composites pyrolyzed at 1000 °C were used. The compression
experiments were performed at room temperature until sample breakage
was detected with a cross-head speed ranging from 40 to 86 μm
min–1. Young’s modulus was calculated from
the ratio of the force applied per unit of area to the strain of the
sample.

4.3.5 Characterizations
The size distribution
of the GO flakes was examined using dynamic light scattering (DLS,
Malvern ns290). TEM images and selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns were obtained from a JEOL 1011 transmission electron
microscope. The thickness of the GO flakes was measured by a Veeco
Dimension 3100 atomic force microscope system. The proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum of the SiCO precursor
was obtained from a Bruker Avance III 400 (400 MHz) (Figure S4). The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum
of polysiloxane precursor was investigated by a Perkin Elmer Spectrum
100 spectrometer (Figure S5). The morphology
and elemental composition of the ceramic composites were examined
with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS Ultra 55) coupled
with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The decomposition
and mass loss of the ceramic composites and starting materials were
acquired by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, TA Instruments) in
argon atmosphere. Raman spectra of the ceramic composites were obtained
from a WiTec Raman system equipped with a 532 nm laser operated at
a power of 0.175 mW for all characterizations. The chemical states
of the elements in the ceramic composites were tested by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5400).
