Aldehyde oxidase
(AO) is a molybdenum-containing enzyme involved
in the clearance of drug compounds containing aldehydes and N-containing
heterocyclic fragments. AO has gained considerable interest in recent
years because of examples of too fast clearance of drug compounds
in development. Thus, it is important to be able to predict AO-mediated
drug metabolism. Therefore, we have characterized the structural and
energetic aspects of different mechanisms with density functional
theory using the molybdenum cofactor as a model for the reactive part
of the enzyme. For a series of 6-substituted 4-quinazolinones, the
trend in activation energies is the same for three tested reaction
mechanisms. Using the concerted mechanism as a model for the enzymatic
reaction, the transition states (TSs) for the formation of all
possible metabolites for a series of known AO substrates were determined.
The lowest activation energies correspond in all cases to the experimentally
observed sites of metabolism (SOMs). Various molecular properties
were calculated and investigated as more easily determinable markers
for reactivity. The stabilities of both intermediates and products
correlate to some extent with the TS energies and may be used to predict
the SOM. The electrostatic-potential-derived charges are also good
markers for the prediction of the experimental SOM for this set of
compounds and may pave the way for the development of fast methods
for the prediction of SOM for AO substrates.

==== Body
Introduction
Aldehyde oxidase (AO)
is an enzyme located in the cytosol of cells
and belongs to the xanthine oxidase (XO) family of molybdoenzymes
that requires a molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) for the catalytic activity.1,2 The precise physiological role of AO remains unclear, but in humans,
it plays an important role in drug metabolism.2,3 Although
aldehydes are not often present in drug compounds, this functional
group can be a result of biotransformation by other drug metabolizing
enzymes, such as the cytochrome P450s, and can be subsequently oxidized
to a carboxylic acid by AO. More importantly in drug discovery, AO
oxidizes a range of N-containing heterocyclic aromatic rings that
are often present in drug compounds. Therefore, several drug discovery
projects have been discontinued after clinical evaluation owing to
high clearance.2 However, AO activity can
also be exploited to activate compounds, increasing the bioavailability
as observed for famciclovir. In addition to the broad substrate profile
of AO, it can also reduce N- and S-oxides and hydrolyze amides.4

In drug discovery projects, it is important
to understand and predict
the AO-mediated reactions of new compounds, preferably prior to synthesis.
In several theoretical studies, different reaction mechanisms have
been investigated and it may be difficult to prove which is correct.
These types of investigations are typically done with density functional
theory (DFT) on a model system containing a part of the MoCo and the
substrate. For AO and XO, Alfaro and Jones suggest a concerted mechanism,
in that the transition state (TS) has the OH of MoCo attacking the
sp2-hybridized C atom while the H atom of the substrate
is transferred to the S atom of the MoCo because it explains the trends
in the rate of product formation for a series of 4-substituted quinazolinones
and also the large observed deuterium isotope effects.5 The effect of a neighboring Glu residue, Glu1270 in human
AO, on the activation energies has been estimated to enhance the stability
of the TS and thus decrease the activation energy for the reaction.5,6 Other mechanisms for the related XO have been proposed in which
an O instead of OH attacks the C atom of the substrate and where a
proton is transferred to the neighboring O of aldehydes or N of xanthine.
The next step, the hydride transfer to S of MoCo, is the rate-limiting
step.7−9

The mechanistic studies have primarily been
done with DFT, and
the TSs are typically time-consuming to determine. Therefore, other
simpler methods to estimate the most probable site of metabolism (SOM)
have been applied to larger sets of compounds. For example, Torres
et al. investigated the partial charges on the aromatic C atom and
the stability of the hydroxylated intermediates and found that the
latter energy descriptor provided a good predictor for reaction by
AO.10 Models combining the stabilities
of the intermediates with a steric factor have been developed to address
whether the SOM is accessible to predict clearance and formation of
SOMs.11,12 Xu et al.12 used
these two descriptors to develop
a decision-tree model for the prediction of SOM with predictivity
values of 0.905 and 0.867 for the training and test set, respectively.
This model predicts either the most reactive sites or medium reactive
sites that are accessible as SOMs. The decision-tree model was shown
to be more predictive than a model that is only based on the intermediate.

In this work, we use MoCo to study the AO reactions by DFT calculations
to determine the activation energies for the possible reactions. Thus,
the steric restraints from the enzyme are not included, which is a
potential pitfall for using the activation energies for the prediction
of SOMs. However, it has previously been observed that the electronic
features of substrates play a major role in the prediction of AO metabolites.10 Several reaction mechanisms have been considered,
and their reaction profiles were determined. Finally, we relate other
molecular properties characterizing the reaction with the activation
energies to enable fast estimates of AO oxidations on large sets of
compounds.

Results and Discussion
Mechanism for 6-Substituted 4-Quinazolinones
The 6-substituted
4-quinazolinone compounds are both XO and AO substrates. Initially,
activation energies were determined for the same series of 6-substituted
4-quinazolinone compounds as studied by Alfaro and Jones (see Figure 1).5 We studied both the concerted and stepwise mechanisms,
as these previously have been proposed as plausible reaction mechanisms.
In addition, the effect of deprotonation of the Mo-bound OH was investigated
to mimic the transfer of a proton to the nearby Glu1270 residue. The
different mechanisms are shown in Figure 1. All energies and distances are shown in Supporting Information, Tables S1–S3.

Figure 1 Reaction
mechanisms of 6-substituted 4-quinazolinones (R = NO2,
CF3, Cl, H, CH3, OCH3,
and NH2) studied in this work. (A) Reaction 1: concerted
mechanism, (B) reaction 2: concerted mechanism with deprotonated MoCo,
and (C) reaction 3: stepwise mechanism with an initial proton transfer
to the nitrogen and subsequent hydride transfer. The H and N atoms
directly involved in the mechanism are colored to ease the interpretation.

For the concerted mechanism (Figure 1A, reaction 1), the
MoCo-bound OH makes a nucleophilic
attack on the C atom (C2) next to the N atom while the H atom is transferred
to the S atom of MoCo. The structures of the reactants, TSs, and products
along with the energies are plotted in Figure 2A. As observed previously,5 4-quinazolinone compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents
at position 6 have the lowest activation energies while the electron-donating
substituents increase the barriers (see Table 1). In vacuum, the B3LYP-calculated activation
energies range from 164 to 181 kJ/mol by comparing the TS and reactant
energies, whereas the activation energies are 93–141 kJ/mol
(cf. Table S1A) when compared with the
separated MoCo and substrate species. Notably, the trends are exactly
the same whether the reactants or separated species are used as reference
(R2 = 0.98). These energies are high but
on average agree within 1 kJ/mol with previously determined energies
for the same substrates when comparing the TS to the separated MoCo
and substrate species. With B3LYP-D3, that is, including dispersion,
the activation energies are similar (within ∼8 kJ/mol) to those
determined with B3LYP and the trends are the same as also observed
by the correlation to the B3LYP energies (R2 = 0.99). The reactions are characterized by short OMoCo–CSub distances (∼1.5 Å) and rather
long HSub–Csub distances (∼1.4
Å) in the TS (cf. Table S1A). In agreement
with the observations by Alfaro and Jones, the lower activation barriers
for the electron-withdrawing groups result in slightly shorter OMoCo–CSub and longer HSub–Csub distances, which is more similar to the product structures.5

for the separated MoCo
and substrate, the intermediates, and the products are given in Tables S1–S3.

c Correlation to the activation energy
for reaction 1 at the B3LYP level. The correlation with the activation
energy for reaction 1 determined as the energy difference between
the TS and the sum of the separated MoCo and substrate is R2 = 0.98. The correlation between TS1 and TS2
for reaction 3 is 0.98 at both B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 levels.

Near MoCo, there is a Glu residue,
Glu1270 in human AO, which has
been considered to be able to deprotonate the OH of MoCo in XO and
AO.5,13 Initially, we included a model for this
residue in the calculations to mimic the activation or the deprotonation
of the OH group. However, we did not succeed in optimizing the TS.
We then characterized the reaction with a deprotonated OH in MoCo
(Figures 1B and 2A, reaction 2). By doing this, the possible energetic
penalty for deprotonating OH is ignored. This significantly decreases
the activation energies to 35–93 and 32–89 kJ/mol for
B3LYP and B3LYP-D3, respectively (see Table 1), and a correlation of R2 = 0.98 with the concerted mechanism with an OH in MoCo
is observed (Figure 1A, reaction 1). Including solvation increases these barriers because
the MoCo with a formal charge of −2 is stabilized in the presence
of solvent. For example, the activation barrier for 4-quinazolinone
increases from 84 kJ/mol in vacuum to 110 and 123 kJ/mol for ε
= 4 and 80, respectively (see Supporting Information, Table S2).

Both of these mechanisms involve a concerted oxidation
of the substrate
and a hydride transfer from the substrate to MoCo, a mechanism already
suggested in 1987 by Skibo et al.14 based
on kinetic studies on substituted quinazolinones by buttermilk XO
and in agreement with more recent computational studies.5

Next, we studied the hydrogen transfer
of the MoCo-bound OH to
the N atom of the substrate, followed by the formation of a tetrahedral
intermediate and a subsequent H transfer to the S atom of MoCo (Figure S1A, reaction 4).6−8,15 However, instead we observed that the other O atom
bound to MoCo spontaneously reacted with the aromatic atom as shown
in Figures 1C and 2B (reaction 3). The activation energies for the
initial proton transfer are rate-limiting and range from 71 to 84
kJ/mol in vacuum and are systematically smaller with B3LYP-D3 by about
4–8 kJ/mol. The subsequent transfer of the H atom to the S
atom of MoCo has a lower TS energy, and the trends in barrier height
are similar to the first and rate-limiting step.

Because the
TS along the path presented in Figure S1A could not be identified, it was then tested if
the trends from a previous study about oxidation of xanthine could
be reproduced.7 In this study, MoCo oxidizes
a negatively charged xanthine (Figure S1B, reaction 4) because previous QM/MM studies had shown this to be
a favorable reaction path. Despite differences in the methods (e.g.,
inclusion of relativistic effects and dispersion functional), we could
reproduce trends from these TS energies (see Table S4), that is, the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl C atom
is lower in energy than the subsequent H transfer to the S atom of
MoCo. Further examination of the binding pocket of AO (PDB entries 4UHW and 4UHX)16 reveals, however, that there is not a residue to abstract
the proton from the substrates, like Glu802 in XO, and therefore,
we did not pursue this reaction further.

Although the different
reaction mechanisms studied with this small
model system have very different activation energies in absolute numbers,
the relative trends of the rate-limiting TS energies are the same
with R2 of 0.98 and 0.96 for reactions
2 and 3 at the B3LYP level compared with reaction 1 (Table 1). Thus, all mechanisms are
equally useful for the following studies because the ranking of the
TS energies at different sites in a substrate would be the same. We
decided to continue with the concerted mechanism because it agrees
well with the observed large deuterium isotope effects, suggesting
that the hydride transfer to the S atom of MoCo is rate-limiting.14 Moreover, reaction 3 would require a heteroatom
accepting a proton as neighbor to the C atom that is oxidized, which
is not always the case, for example, for a substrate such as N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide (DACA).
Thus, in the following, the TSs were determined with the mechanism
for reaction 1.

Activation Energies for AO Substrates
To explore the
reactions for AO substrates, we investigated all possible AO sites
in quinazoline, phthalazine, and quinoline using reaction 1 (Figure 3). For comparison,
the most electron-withdrawing (NO2) or electron-donating
(NH2) substituents at position 6 of quinazoline were included.
Moreover, the observed AO SOMs of phenanthridine and DACA were included.
The latter, DACA, was included because it has an unusual SOM opposite
to the N atom of the aromatic ring. Finally, we also studied famciclovir
as an example of a compound, where AO metabolism increases the bioavailability
of the active species.

was modeled as 2-aminopurine. */** indicate primary/secondary SOMs.
Aromatic C atoms were colored according to TS energies (kJ/mol, at
the B3LYP level) for the concerted reaction. TS energies are relative
to the separated MoCo and substrate (cf. Tables S6–S11). The scale is from 131.9 kJ/mol (C4 of quinazoline)
to 203.9 kJ/mol (C4 of phenanthridine). Nonaromatic C atoms and aromatic
N atoms are colored white.

Quinazolines
The trends in activation energies for
oxidations of C2 in 6-NO2 and 6-NH2 quinazolines
were similar to the 6-substituted 4-quinazolidine compounds, that
is, the electron-withdrawing group has a low barrier (Table S5). Considering all possible aromatic
C atoms for quinazoline, C2 and C4, that is, the observed AO SOMs,
have the lowest barriers of 154.2 and 131.9 kJ/mol, respectively (cf. Table S6, TS energies at the B3LYP level relative
to separated MoCo and substrate). The primary SOM, C4, has the lowest
barrier as clearly seen in Figure 4, where it is also observed that positions 5, 6, 7,
and 8 have significantly higher TS energies of 164.9–191.1
kJ/mol.

energies) for the AO substrates. For each compound, the TS energies
for the aromatic C atoms are listed. */** indicate primary/secondary
SOMs.

Phthalazine
Phthalazine
has three different C atoms,
which in principle can be oxidized by AO. The reaction with the lowest
TS energy of 152.1 kJ/mol oxidizes C4 and yields 1-phthalazinone (Figure 4 and Table S7), which also is the primary metabolite
observed experimentally.18 Reactions on
C5 and C6 have higher TS energies of 184.1 and 188.6 kJ/mol, respectively.

Quinoline
Although quinoline itself is not a drug compound,
the quinoline moiety is present in numerous drug compounds and natural
products.19 Examples on quinoline-containing
compounds are the alkaloids such as quinine, quinidine, cinchonine,
and cinchonidine, which all are oxidized at C2 in the quinoline moiety
to give the corresponding lactams.20 The
DFT calculations show that oxidation at the most reactive C atom C2
has a TS energy of 156.2 kJ/mol (Figure 4 and Table S8)
and corresponds to the experimentally observed AO metabolite of quinoline.21 TS energies for reactions on the remaining C
atoms range from 167.1 to 202.4 kJ/mol.

Famciclovir
Famciclovir
is a prodrug of penciclovir
with an improved oral bioavailability. The conversion of famciclovir
to penciclovir requires hydrolyses of the ester functionalities and
an AO-mediated oxidation of the 2-aminopurine moiety at position 6
forming the 6-oxo-metabolite. In addition to this major metabolite,
the isomeric 8-oxo- and the 6,8-dioxo-metabolites are also formed
in smaller amounts.22 The TS energy for
forming the 8-oxo-metabolite of 151.9 kJ/mol is 20 kJ/mol (Figure 4 and Table S9), lower than that required for the formation
of the 6-oxo-metabolite (with the primary SOM); however, both reactions
have relatively low TS energies. Thus, the TS energies do not reflect
the formation of the primary and secondary metabolites, which are
most likely due to the steric hindrance at C8, an effect that is not
taken into account when not considering the rest of the enzyme. It
is also worth mentioning that the DFT calculations were not done on
the actual famciclovir molecule, but on the parent moiety, 2-amino-9-methylpurine,
that is, without considering the flexible substituent on N9.

N-[2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide
DACA has been included in this study because it is a substrate
for AO, although it does not contain a cyclic −CH=N–
moiety. Experimentally, it has been shown that metabolism takes place
at position 9, yielding the 9(10H)-acridone metabolite.23 The DFT calculations were performed on 4-methylacridine
and showed that oxidation at C9 has the lowest TS energy of 153.7
kJ/mol (Figure 4 and Table S10), whereas the other C oxidations are
in the range of 170.0–190.0 kJ/mol and, thus, more unfavorable.
Although not having a neighboring N atom, the geometry in the TS for
oxidation of C9 is very similar to those on C atoms in substrates
next to a N atom (comparing Tables S9 with S1–S8, S11). Other metabolic enzymes may
also metabolize DACA, CYP450 may give N-demethylated metabolites and
FMO may give N-oxide, and these metabolites may subsequently be oxidized
at C9 by AO.24 The result for this atypical
AO substrate suggests that the mechanism-based approach presented
here is not limited to −CH=N– containing compounds
but is generally applicable. This is in contrast to reaction 3 in
which the H atom of the Mo-bound OH is transferred to a N atom next
to the C atom of the substrate.

Phenanthridine
In phenanthridine, C6 is the most reactive
site, and oxidation proceeds via the lowest TS energy (150.7 kJ/mol,
cf. Table S11) in agreement with experimental
data showing that phenanthridinone is the only metabolite formed by
AO.25 This energy is significantly lower
than that of TS energies of 171.3–203.9 kJ/mol for the other
C atoms.

Considering the DFT-calculated TS energies for all
of the relevant C atoms, the TS energies at the B3LYP level for the
experimentally observed SOMs range from 131.9 (C4 of quinazoline)
to 172.0 kJ/mol (C6 of famciclovir). For quinazoline, phthalazine,
quinoline, DACA, and phenanthridine, the lowest TS energies are observed
for the atoms that are the experimentally observed primary SOMs. For
famciclovir, both of the experimentally observed primary and secondary
SOMs correspond to atoms associated with low TS energies. Thus, based
on these AO substrates, it seems that a threshold of ∼160 kJ/mol
could be used to estimate whether AO oxidation takes place.

The present approach considers only the interactions between the
MoCo and the substrate and, accordingly, ignores the effect of the
surrounding protein. The substrate specificity between AO and XO metabolisms
seems to be caused by two residues in the active site: Val811 and
Met889 in AO and Glu802 and Arg880 in XO.26 Thus, the active site in AO is more hydrophobic than the XO active
site, where the Glu802 and Arg880 residues in several X-ray structures
are seen to fix the orientation of the substrate by several hydrogen
bonds.27 One may therefore speculate that
AO-mediated metabolism primarily is determined by reactivity and XO-mediated
metabolism by reactivity and the possibility for establishing some
specific hydrogen bonds. In both cases, the shape of the active sites
may also play a role.

Fast Methods for the Prediction of SOM
Because the
TS energies are time-consuming to determine, we investigated if other
estimates of the reactivity could be used to indicate whether a site
in the AO substrate is a likely SOM. The energies of the species formed
along the reaction pathway were determined, that is, stability of
the hydroxylated tetrahedral intermediate, the cation intermediate,
and the product (Figure S2 and Table S12). We also considered the electronic
properties of the aromatic C atoms via their electrostatic potential
(ESP) and natural bond order (NBO) charges (Table S12). All calculated estimates of the intermediate or product
stability were correlated with the TS energies. The best correlations
are observed for the stability of the products and the ESP charges
with R2 of 0.62 and 0.58, respectively.
Slightly worse correlations are observed for the intermediate stabilities
and NBO charges (cf. Table 2 and Figure S3). As shown in Figures 5 and S4, the stabilities of the intermediate, the
cation, and the product are generally more favorable for the SOMs
than the non-SOMs, whereas positively charged C atoms are characteristic
for the atoms being SOMs.

More important than the correlation
coefficient is the ability
to distinguish between SOMs and non-SOMs. As already noted, the TS
energies are lowest for the SOMs, and thus, they could be good predictors
of where the AO reaction oxidizes the substrates. This is also clearly
observed in the box plots in Figure 5 where the box and whiskers for the SOMs are in a narrow
range of ∼150 kJ/mol with only two outliers (C4 of quinazoline
and C6 of famciclovir, see also Figure 4). The product stabilities and ESP or NBO charges of
the SOMs are separated from the other aromatic C atoms in Figure 5. Thus, for larger
sets of compounds, it would be reasonable to consider these simpler
properties as indicators of AO-mediated SOM than determining the more
time-consuming TS energies.

Torres et al.10 investigated the relationship
between the charge of a carbon atom near a nitrogen atom and the ability
to predict the SOM in the compound. Their conclusion was that ESP
charges were not as predictive as other reactivity measures because
they were not always able to predict the primary SOM correctly. Although
the ESP (and NBO) charges do not correlate well with the activation
energy of the different sites, the most positive charges are the SOMs
in all compounds, except for DACA. In DACA, C3 has a charge that is
+0.13 compared with +0.11 for C9 (cf. Table S12C). Torres et al. instead used the stability of the tetrahedral intermediate,
with OH added to the C atom and an H atom added to the N atom, resulting
in a net addition of water, to predict >90% of the SOMs correctly.
The stability of the intermediate was also used as a descriptor by
Jones and Korzekwa and Xu et al.11,12 As seen in Figure 5, there is a separation
between the SOM and the non-SOM stability for our estimates of the
tetrahedral intermediates. Two sites are not correctly predicted (the
intermediate generated from a reaction on C4 of quinoline and C7 of
phenanthridine is more stable). The energy of the intermediate for
C9 of DACA, on the other hand, is very low (214 kJ/mol compared with
all other intermediates). Although the decision-tree model is an ultrafast
method, the determination of the energy difference at the B3LYP level
reduces the speed of the method and it could be interesting to develop
a model based on the ESP charges, where only one calculation is necessary,
instead of a calculation of both the substrate and the intermediate.

Conclusions
We have studied three different mechanisms for
the AO-mediated
oxidation of N-containing heterocyclic compounds and their trend in
activation energies. We showed that the TS energies for all three
reactions correlate. In addition, B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 energies correlate.
For one of the mechanisms, the concerted mechanism, we have determined
the activation energy for the formation of all possible metabolites
showing that the reaction with the lowest activation barrier generally
corresponds to the formation of the experimentally observed metabolite.

We have also shown that the SOM for AO-mediated metabolism can
be derived from various molecular properties such as the ESP partial
charges, which indicates that it will be possible to develop methods
to predict SOM, which are considerably faster than the methods relying
on identifying TSs.

Methods
The MoCo was modeled as
a Mo–dithiolene complex, with an
oxygen, a hydroxyl, and a sulfur substituent. All calculations were
done at the DFT/B3LYP or DFT/B3LYP-D3 level of theory.28−31 Previous calculations on reactions with Mo-containing model systems
with 1,2-dimethyldithiolene bound have shown that B3LYP can reproduce
coupled cluster-derived energies.32,33 The TSs were
identified by scanning the reaction coordinates before the TS optimizations
were done. The TSs were verified by making a frequency calculation.
All structures were optimized using the def2-SVP basis set, and the
final energies were determined using the def2-larger TZVPP basis set.34 The energies were corrected for the zero-point
vibrations. It is indicated that the energies are corrected for solvation
with the COSMO model with dielectric constants of 4 and 80.35 The COSMO calculations were done with optimized
radii of H, C, N, O, and S and 2.0 Å for Mo.7 All activation energies were given relative to the sum
of the MoCo and substrate energies. ESP and NBO charges were calculated
for each atom of the different substrates with single-point DFT calculations,
using the def2-SVP basis set. For the stability of intermediates,
cation and product geometry optimizations were conducted using the
def2-SVP basis set.34 As shown in Figure S2, the difference in energy was calculated
between the substrate and MoCo and (1) the sum of the product and
the protonated and dehydroxylated MoCo; (2) the sum of the intermediate
and the dehydroxylated MoCo; and (3) the sum of the cation and the
MoCo + H–. TURBOMOLE was used for all DFT calculations.36
