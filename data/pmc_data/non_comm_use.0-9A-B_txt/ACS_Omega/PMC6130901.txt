Metals
on metal implants have long been used in arthroplasties
because of their robustness and low dislocation rate. Several relatively
low-corrosion metals have been used in arthroplasty, including 316L
stainless steel, titanium, and cobalt–chromium–molybdenum
alloy. Debris from these implants, however, has been found to cause
inflammatory responses leading to unexpected failure rates approaching
10% 7 years surgery. Safety assessment of these materials traditionally
relies on the use of simple two-dimensional assays, where cells are
grown on the surface of the material over a relatively short time
frame. It is now well-known that the composition and stiffness of
the extracellular matrix (ECM) have a critical effect on cell function.
In this work, we have evaluated how cobalt ions influence the assembly
of type I collagen, the principle component of the ECM in bone. We
found that cobalt had a significant effect on collagen matrix formation,
and its presence results in local variations in collagen density.
This increase in heterogeneity causes an increase in localized mechanical
properties but a decrease in the bulk stiffness of the material. Moreover,
when collagen matrices contained cobalt ions, there was a significant
change in how the cells interacted with the collagen matrix. Fluorescence
images and biological assays showed a decrease in cell proliferation
and viability with an increase in cobalt concentration. We present
evidence that the cobalt ion complex interacts with the hydroxyl group
present in the carboxylic terminal of the collagen fibril, preventing
crucial stabilizing bonds within collagen formation. This demonstrates
that the currently accepted toxicity assays are poor predictors of
the longer-term biological performance of a material.

Introduction
Cobalt–chromium–molybdenum
alloys are one of the
most common alloys used for both metal-on-metal (MOM) arthroplasties
and implant resurfacing because of their high level of robustness
and low risk of dislocation.1−3 MOM implants have been found to
have lower wear rates than metal-on-polyethylene implants and generate
smaller wear particles;4,5 however, there is a 500-fold increase
in the generation rate of these small particles.4−6 Metallic debris
from MOM implants has been shown to initiate inflammatory responses
which can lead to issues such as implant loosening and bone resorption.7−10 In 2013, the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement
Registry found unexpected failure rates approaching 10% after 7 years
for MOM hip replacements alone.1 Furthermore,
MOM implants are 1.5 times more likely to fail 2 years post primary
surgery in comparison with metal-on-polyethylene implants.11 These failures were discovered because of the
unexpected pain in patients, even in those with well-positioned implants,
which suggested an adverse biological reaction to implant material
derivatives rather than a biomechanical failure.12 Damage as a consequence of the release of particles and
ions from the implant surface has been shown to affect both the bone
and the surrounding soft tissue.13

In addition to the production of particulate debris due to wear,
MOM implants are also susceptible to corrosion processes in vivo that
lead to the generation of small particles (including nanoscale) and
the release of implant metal ions. Tribocorrosion occurs at the surface
of articulating components of MOM implants as a consequence of the
combination of mechanical wear and localized corrosion.14 The unchallenged implant surface is protected
from dissolution because of the presence of a passive surface oxide
layer that limits corrosion. Disruption of this passive surface layer
(due to mechanical damage) results in the exposure of the underlying
metal, dissolution (anodic reaction), and the formation of metal cations.
The reaction produces electron flow from the corroding site to the
metal surface (cathode), which is passive. Hydrolysis of released
metal ions leads to a local acidification, which can subsequently
allow free ions to easily migrate away from the original surface.15,16 Cobalt–chromium–molybdenum alloys are protected by
a passive oxide layer, which is 1–4 nm thick and primarily
comprised chromium and cobalt oxides. The repetitive mechanical movement
associated with load-bearing arthoplasties results in the abrasion
of this thin oxide layer. Alongside the generation of particulate
debris, the ionic cobalt and chromium released either remains in the
solution or precipitates within the extracellular tissue space. As
cobalt is more soluble than chromium, it is more likely to remain
in the ionic form and interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM).14

Most investigations into how cobalt ions
affect the surrounding
tissue have focused on two-dimensional cell cultures, mimicking the
osteolytic inflammatory response, driven by a direct interaction between
macrophages and cobalt debris.17−20 In particular, cobalt ions have been found to interact
with DNA and nuclear proteins, ultimately causing cell death.21 More specifically, cobalt ions are able to cross
the cytoplasmic membrane, accumulating in the cell nucleus and subsequently
the surrounding structures.21−23 It has also been found that cobalt
ions cause apoptosis in macrophages after 24 h and necrosis after
48 h.24,25 Furthermore, cobalt ions exacerbate inflammation
by increasing the amount of proinflammatory cytokines that are released
from macrophages, such as tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-1b, and Il-6.19−21,26,27 In addition to this, two-dimensional cell cultures looking at the
direct effect of cobalt ions on osteoblast/mesenchymal stem cells
have also been investigated. Studies showed how addition of cobalt
ions into the cell media caused a decrease in the proliferation and
function of osteoblasts and the differentiation of mesenchymal stem
cells to osteoblasts.28−31 In addition to being a degradation product from metallic prostheses,
cobalt has been used to stimulate the HIF 1a pathway and angiogenesis.
Glasses loaded with up to 1 wt % have proven to be nontoxic with a
maximal dose of 5 wt % before toxicity occurs. At this point, there
are no reports on how much concentration may influence the ECM or
ECM interactions.32−34 However, it is well-known that cell interactions
are driven by small changes in the three-dimensional ECM, and therefore,
two-dimensional studies are not sufficient.35

To date, studies in this area have investigated only the cellular
effect of metal debris. However, it is the ECM that directly interacts
with both implant and the surrounding tissue. The ECM mostly comprises
collagen type I and provides not only structural support to cells
and surrounding connective tissue but also plays a role within the
differentiation of surrounding cells.35−40 Collagen type I chains comprise a triple amino acid repeating sequence,
Gly-X-Y, where glycine residues occupy every third position, and the
X and Y residues are usually proline and hydroxyproline, respectively.
Three collagen chains bind together via hydrogen bonding to form a
triple helical structure, typically spanning 300 nm in length.41 After both intra- and extracellular modification,
the triple helix forms a collagen molecule.42 As collagen matrix formation is hierarchical, multiple stages are
required prior to collagen fiber formation. Five-stranded microfibrils
super-twist and quasihexagonally stack, via covalent and hydrogen
bonding, to form a collagen fibril. Because of the parallel staggering
formed from the super-twist, a regular overlapping pattern, referred
to as d-spacing, can be observed. This typically
measures approximately 67 nm.43−45 Fibrils can range from 50 to
a few hundred nanometers in thickness and aggregate, via covalent
bonding, to form fibers.41 These fibers
are cord-shaped and typically range within 1–20 μm in
diameter.43 Collagen fibers are the main
constituents of the ECM and provide structural support to surrounding
cells. As metallic ions produced from corrosion of MOM implants are
so small, they can interact with the collagen fiber at much earlier
stages of development. This can hinder the hierarchical process of
collagen formation and may potentially alter both mechanical and structural
properties of the matrix. Any changes to the structure of the ECM
will drastically affect the way in which cells attach and thereby
affect the tissue function. This study investigates how the presence
of cobalt(II) ions affects collagen matrix formation and cell interactions
to better understand unexpected MOM failures. Osteoblast cells were
used to understand the effects of changes to the ECM without the influence
of inflammatory changes. A maximum concentration of 200 ppm was used
as this is the highest recorded cobalt concentration at the injury
site.46 This study highlights the importance
of understanding the long-term biocompatibility of materials regarding
not only cell response but also changes to the ECM.

Results
The effect of cobalt ions on the fibrillogenesis of collagen formation
was analyzed using UV–vis spectrophotometry. Turbidity measurements,
as shown in Figure 1A, suggest that the cobalt ion concentration has a detrimental effect
on the kinetics of collagen fibril assembly. It takes much longer
for the fibrils to fully form with the addition of cobalt as shown
by the extension of the growth phase. This is further shown by comparing
the growth phase ratios with respect to 0 ppm, as shown in Figure 1B. Turbidity results
suggest that even at low concentrations, the cobalt ions interact
with the collagen fibrils. To determine the loss of cobalt ions from
collagen hydrogels, a leaching assay was performed, as shown in Figure 1C. The CoCol gel
with a cobalt concentration of 200 ppm released only 8 ppm of cobalt
ions into the surrounding media after 6 days. Given the small size
of the cobalt ions,4 it is unlikely that
they are trapped sterically in the hydrogel matrix. This suggests
that the ions are binding strongly within the hydrogel, preventing
their diffusion into the media.

cobalt concentration with respect to 0 ppm. (C) Leaching of cobalt
ions from collagen hydrogels at varying time points. The initial cobalt
concentrations were 0, 67, 133, and 200 ppm.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to fully understand
the effect of cobalt ions on the formation of collagen matrices. The
microstructure of collagen fibrils doped with cobalt is shown in Figure 2. These images show
that there are areas of both high- and low-density collagen fibrils
in samples containing cobalt, as demonstrated in Figure 2A,B. These observations were
also confirmed by reflectance microscopy images, shown in Figure 2C, as there is more
collagen agglomeration with the addition of cobalt. This indicates
that the cobalt ions alter the localized structure of the collagen
matrix.

levels of cobalt ions. (B) Density histogram indicating the number
of fibrils present within a 5000 pixel2 area. Fibrils were
separated into three categories, low (4–6 fibrils), medium
(7–10 fibrils), and high (11–13 fibrils), and the number
of areas with distinct number of fibrils was tallied to obtain the
area frequency. (C) Confocal reflectance images of 1 mg mL–1 collagen with added cobalt ions.

Force spectroscopy measurements on the CoCol gels were performed
to determine the effect of cobalt addition on the adhesiveness of
the samples. Because there is no alteration to the chemical nature
of the collagen gel, nanomechanical properties could effectively reflect
the localized arrangement of collagen fibrils. Large adhesion forces
measured by the AFM tip are due to an increased contact area as a
result of a readily deformed collagen network and vice versa. Samples
containing 0, 67, and 133 ppm of cobalt appear to have both stiff
and soft fibrils. However, adhesion forces of the 200 ppm sample show
that the fibrils are only soft, as shown in Figure 3. This result indicates that increased concentrations
of cobalt ions could possibly block the important cross-linking binding
sites for collagen and hence result in a porous matrix with enhanced
local adhesiveness and reduced stiffness.

gels at 0 (A), 67 (B), 133 (C), and 200 ppm
(D) indicating the adhesion force of collagen fibrils.

To analyze the dispersion of cobalt throughout
the bulk matrix,
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements of CoCol gels were obtained,
indicating the presence of cobalt ions, as depicted in Figure 4. It was shown that there were
regions of localized cobalt, instead of an even dispersion, with an
average 3-fold increase in cobalt concentration at areas of high intensity.
This suggests that the increase in the heterogeneity of collagen fibrils
within CoCol gels may be due to the uneven distribution of cobalt
ions.

ppm collagen hydrogel. (A) Bright-field image of bulk hydrogel, (B)

2 used to obtain an average of a 3-fold increase in cobalt fluorescence,
and (F) average cobalt concentration of all object areas separated
by relatively high and low concentrations, giving a P value <0.1.

The effects of the heterogeneous
dispersion of cobalt on the bulk
material properties of collagen hydrogels were determined using oscillatory
rheology, shown in Figure 5. Overall, there was a reduction in the storage and loss moduli
of the gel with the addition of even low concentrations of cobalt.
This indicates that the addition of cobalt ions reduces the stiffness
of the hydrogel. This bulk property may be due to the areas of low-density
collagen fibrils caused by cobalt collagen interactions as they are
structurally weaker over the bulk gel structure.

(A) and G″ (B)
from a frequency sweep of collagen hydrogels with the addition of
an increasing concentration of cobalt ions.

As the underlying structure of collagen effects the growth
and
proliferation of cells, various biological assays were performed.
MC3T3 cells maintain a relatively high viability when seeded onto
CoCol gels up to a cobalt concentration of 133 ppm, as shown by the
confocal fluorescence images in Figure 6A. In comparison, MC3T3 cells seeded within a cobalt-doped
culture medium only maintained a relatively high viability up to a
cobalt concentration of 67 ppm, as shown in Figure 6B. This further indicates that any cell response
is not due to the direct interaction between the cells and the cobalt
ions. Furthermore, the presence of cobalt ions within the collagen
hydrogel caused a change in the morphology, with an initial increase
in actin filament elongation prior to reduction in the cellular cytoskeleton
entirely, as shown in Figure 6C. Metabolic activity of the cells is reduced with the addition
of cobalt ions as shown by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Figure 6D shows an 82% decrease in the absorbance showing a decrease
in active mitochondria at a cobalt concentration of 100 ppm. The alamarBlue
assay and trypan blue assay indicate that the proliferation of cells
significantly decreased when low concentrations of cobalt ions were
added to the collagen structure. This decrease was significant for
both cells seeded onto CoCol gels and cells seeded within a cobalt-doped
culture medium as shown in Figure 6E,F. This suggests that the structure of CoCol gels
is directly affecting the way in which cells attach and therefore
proliferate, causing a reduction in viability that correlates with
the cobalt concentration.

To experimentally determine the preferential binding site
between
cobalt ions and collagen, Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) of both 0 and 200 ppm of cobalt-doped collagen samples
were performed. Raman spectra of both 0 and 200 ppm collagen samples
showed characteristic protein peaks such as the C=O peak at
1606.75/1607.76 cm–1 and the secondary amide peak
at 1205.08/1207.25 cm–1, as shown in Figure 7A.47 However, in order to determine any subtle differences between each
sample, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the data
set after cosmic ray removal. The majority of information was described
by the first two principal components. Figure 7B corresponds to the scores plot48 for all the Raman spectra, within which two
clusters separating the 0 ppm sample and 200 ppm sample were obtained.
The position of relative differences between the 0 and 200 ppm samples
was determined through plotting the loading vectors as a function
of wavenumber.49 The plot of the first
loading, shown in Figure 7C, indicates the most prominent changes between the spectra
through intense peaks.48 It was found that
the largest variation between the Raman spectra of the 0 ppm sample
and the 200 ppm sample occurred at 869 and 1000 cm–1, respectively.

hydrogels,
(B) score plots of the first two principal components, (C) loading
plots of the first principal component indicating changes at 1000
and 869 cm–1, and (D) DSC measurements indicating
a reduction in energy required to remove bulk water between 0 and
200 ppm CoCol gels.

These wavenumbers correspond
to a C–O bond,47 with this vibration
being suppressed within the 200 ppm
sample. DSC results show that bulk water within the 200 ppm collagen
sample is not bound as strongly as that within the 0 ppm collagen
sample. All the bound water within the 200 ppm collagen sample is
removed at a temperature of 120.3, 5 °C lower than that of the
0 ppm collagen sample. In addition, the energy required to completely
remove the water bound within the 0 ppm collagen sample is 14% more
than that within the 200 ppm collagen, as shown in Figure 7D. This highly suggests that
cobalt is binding to the collagen fibril, reducing the number of tightly
bound water molecules surrounding the protein.

Discussion
The
introduction of cobalt ions to collagen hydrogels causes significant
effects in both the gel structure and the way in which cells attach
to the collagen. These ions cause a change in the kinetics of fibril
formation. The elongation of the growth phase indicates that cobalt
ions directly interact with the collagen fibrils. On incubation, the
CoCol gels released a maximum of only 8 ppm of cobalt, suggesting
that there is a strong interaction between the cobalt ions and the
hydrogel, preventing the cobalt ions from diffusing out of the gel.
AFM and confocal reflectance images show how increasing the concentration
of cobalt increases areas of high-density collagen. A density histogram
indicates that the addition of cobalt to the collagen matrix causes
a high number of fibrils per unit area. These regions suggest that
the cobalt ions ionically interact with the matrix to create areas
of agglomeration, indicating that the cobalt ions are most likely
present within these high-density regions. Overall, this causes an
increase in the heterogeneity of the local collagen matrix. Force
spectroscopy measurements indicated that a concentration of 200 ppm
produced softer fibrils than that of 0 ppm. Furthermore, samples containing
67 and 133 ppm had areas of both stiff and soft fibrils, whereas 200
ppm only had soft fibrils. This may be due to a decrease in cross-linking
sites between fibrils, as they are blocked by cobalt ions.

Cobalt
distribution throughout the bulk of the hydrogel, determined
via XRF–, further indicates that the collagen fibril agglomeration
sites are formed because of an increase in the localized cobalt concentration.
As there was a 3-fold relative increase in cobalt concentrations at
select sites, it can be assumed that these areas correspond to high-density
collagen areas.

Regions of high and low densities of collagen
make the overall
bulk structure less stiff. Oscillatory rheology shows a decrease in
the storage and loss moduli with even low concentrations of cobalt,
indicating a reduction in overall stiffness. This may be due to the
low-density areas of collagen which act as weak points within the
structure. The increase in ionic bonding between collagen fibrils
and cobalt ions prevents the interactions forming between collagen
fibrils themselves and therefore reduces the overall stiffness of
the hydrogel structure.

As we determined from Figure 1C, there was insignificant
leaching of cobalt ions
from the collagen hydrogel to have any effect on cell proliferation
and viability. Therefore, any decrease is due to the change in the
matrix formation alone. Fluorescence images suggest that the manipulation
of collagen fibrils by the introduction of cobalt ions results in
not only a decrease in cell viability but also a change in the morphology
of the cells. This was further confirmed by phalloidin and DAPI staining,
showing that at low concentrations of cobalt, there was an elongation
of actin filaments, preventing the alignment of cells. Increasing
the concentration of cobalt ions also caused a reduction in the actin
filament production. This may be due to an increase in the heterogeneity
of the bulk matrix. Cell viability staining indicated that there was
no overall cell death until 200 ppm of cobalt was added, however,
because the heterogeneous distribution of cobalt in collagen cell
viability varied between 67 and 133 ppm. Force measurements indicated
that at 200 ppm, fibrils formed an overall soft material. This may
explain why cell death significantly increased at 200 ppm as the fibrils
were not stiff enough to support cell growth. The MTT assay, alamarBlue
assay, and trypan blue assay further suggest that the manipulation
of collagen fibrils by cobalt ions prevents cells from behaving normally.
The decrease in cell proliferation with an increase in cobalt ions
may imply that poorly formed collagen fibrils, resulting in a heterogeneous
matrix, cannot facilitate signaling between cells. The reduction in
attachment sites between the cell and the collagen fibril results
in a rounding-off of the cells, preventing the cells from signaling
to each other and proliferating.

When cobalt(II) chloride is
dissolved in water, the predominant
cation is [Co(H2O)6]2+.50 As [Co(H2O)6]2+ is a positive complex in solution, it will interact with negatively
charged amino acid residues along the collagen chains. Negatively
charged collagen chains can interact with water molecules and form
a dense and strongly bound hydration monolayer. Four water molecules
of the monolayer bind with the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of both
glycine and hydroxyproline in collagen, as shown in Figure 8A.51,52 Proline, however, is not associated with collagen hydration, participating
only in interchain hydrogen bonding.53 Initial
hydration of the collagen molecule, referred to as nonfreezing bound
water, is formed when water binds to hydrophilic amino acid residues
of the collagen. Once all hydrophilic sites are filled, the water
binds to nonpolar regions of the collagen, referred to as freezing
bound water, completing the hydration monolayer, Figure 8B.52

of water with a collagen fibril, not to scale. (A) Four water molecules
per three collagen residues. (B) Nonfreezing and freezing bound water
layers surrounding the collagen fibril. Image adapted from Fullerton
and Amurao.49

As there is a lack of direct interactions between neighboring
collagen
molecules, it is assumed that hydrogen bonding of water bridges between
residues in neighboring molecules contributes to the matrix assembly.
Intrachain water bridges are dependent on the local environment and
are typically two to three molecules long. Water bridges form in three
ways, either between two hydroxyl groups, C–O···watern···O–C; between two
carboxyl groups, C=O···watern···O=C; or between a hydroxyl group and
a carbonyl group in adjacent molecules, C–O···watern···O=C.47

When [Co(H2O)6]2+ is introduced
into the collagen matrix, it may interact either directly with individual
collagen fibrils or with water molecules of the nonfreezing bound
water layer, depicted in Figure 9A,B. We then examined possible underlying mechanisms
responsible for cobalt collagen interaction. Direct interaction of
cobalt complexes with collagen molecules occurs through either the
carbonyl groups present in both glycine and hydroxyproline or the
hydroxyl group present in hydroxyproline alone, shown in Figure 9C,D. If the cobalt
complex interacts with the nonfreezing bound water layer, then hydrogen
bonds will form between the water molecules and the cobalt complex,
incorporating the complex into the water bridge, shown in Figure 9E. In addition, cobalt
may also interact with the carboxylic terminal of the collagen molecule,
as shown in Figure 9F.

Proposed binding sites of a cobalt complex with a collagen fibril
where interactions occur with the carboxylic group (C), hydroxyl group
(D), forming a water bridge (E), or interactions with the hydroxyl
structure in the carboxylic terminal (F).

Raman spectroscopy showed suppression of a secondary alcohol
vibration,
with a reduction in the C–O bond peak, between 0 and 200 ppm
collagen samples. This suggests that cobalt ions interact specifically
with a hydroxyl group.52−54 Although this is present within the hydroxyproline,
previous studies into complex interactions with collagens show preferential
binding to terminal sites of the molecule.55 Therefore, it is more likely that the cobalt ions interact with
the hydroxyl structure at the carboxylic terminal. DSC measurements
showed that a 14% decrease in energy is required to remove bound water
from the 200 ppm CoCol gel. This suggests that cobalt ion interactions
prevent water binding either by blocking of the binding sites or altering
the assembly of the collagen molecules, preventing these binding sites
from being accessible.

Conclusions
We have shown that cobalt
ions have an adverse effect on the way
in which collagen fibrils form. An increase in the cobalt ion concentration
lengthens the time it takes for a collagen matrix to form and produce
areas of both high-density and low-density collagen fibrils. This
causes an increase in the structural heterogeneity, reducing the overall
stiffness of the collagen hydrogel. This change in matrix formation
prevents osteoblasts from attaching and proliferating at a normal
rate, changing the cell morphology and ultimately resulting in a decrease
in cell viability. We have also suggested that the binding site for
cobalt ions lies with the hydroxyl group present in the C-terminal.
This leads toward a reduction in crucial stabilizing bonds within
matrix formation, explaining the decrease in matrix stiffness and
reduction in energy required for bulk water loss.

This gives
further insights into the underlying mechanisms that
result in unexpected failures of MOM implants. As we have shown, the
collagen matrix is adversely affected, and it is likely that the extensive
necrosis seen is more a result of the metal debris changing the ECM
structure rather than interacting with the surrounding cells directly.

Materials
and Methods
Cobalt-doped collagen hydrogels (CoCol gels):
Cultrex rat collagen
type I (AMS Biotechnology Europe Marketplace, UK) supplied at a concentration
of 5 mg mL–1 was diluted to 3 mg mL–1 using a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) stock (NaCl 0.137 M, KCl
0.003 M, Na2HPO4 0.008 M, KH2PO4 0.0015 M). This stock was created by dissolving two Oxoid
PBS tablets (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) in 200 mL of distilled
water. The cobalt(II) chloride stock was made to a concentration of
72.67 mg mL–1 with double-distilled water. Collagen
was further diluted to the desired concentrations using Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) or cobalt-infused
DMEM and neutralized with 1 M sodium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, UK)
prior to incubation for 3 h to ensure gelation.

Turbidity
A UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Cecil
Instruments, UK) was used to measure the turbidity of collagen dispersion
during the process of fibril formation. Temperature was maintained
at 37 °C, and samples were placed into a disposable 1 cm plastic
cuvette, with absorbance measured at 620 nm.

Leaching Assay
CoCol gels were prepared using Co concentrations
of 0, 67, 133 and 200 ppm within a 12-well plate. PBS (2 mL) (as prepared
above) was added to the wells, removed at the fixed time points, and
frozen. A 7500ce inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer
(Agilent Technologies, USA) was used to determine the concentration
of leached cobalt ions from the frozen PBS samples. A two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to obtain the statistics.

Atomic Force
Microscopy
CoCol gels were prepared as
indicated above but with a buffer of PBS to reduce building up of
salt during dehydration. Samples were deposited onto a pressure cleaned
silicon wafer using an adjustable micropipette, resulting in a thin
collagen layer on the solid substrate. The gel was dehydrated in an
incubator over 24 h and subsequently washed three times with distilled
water. A 10 × 10 μm2 area of each sample was
imaged by a NanoWizard 4 NanoScience AFM (JPK Instruments, Germany),
using a cantilever with a frequency of 20 kHz and a spring constant
of 0.9 N m–1 in the intermitted contact mode. Fibril
density was determined by counting the number of fibrils present in
a 5000 × 5000 pixel area. For each concentration, 108 areas were
allocated over three samples to determine overall fibril density.
Fibril density was classified as low (4–6 fibrils), medium
(7–10 fibrils), and high (11–13 fibrils) and determined
by separating the number of fibrils into three distinct groups. A
two-way ANOVA was used to obtain the statistics.

Reflectance
Microscopy
CoCol gels were prepared within
a 35 mm imaging dish with an N#1.5 coverslip base. The gels were imaged
with a 60× water immersion lens with a 488 nm laser on an Olympus
FX1000 microscope in the reflection mode. A three-dimensional stack
of fixed volume was acquired via multiple images in the z-direction and compressed into a two-dimensional plane.

Force Spectroscopy
CoCol gel (16 μL) was added
to a silicon wafer. A Dimension 3100 AFM with a NanoScope IV controller
(Veeco, Santa Barbara, USA) was used to perform nanomechanical adhesion
measurements. Silicon nitride cantilevers (Budget Sensors, UK), with
a nominal spring constant of 0.3 N m–1, were used
to carry out these force measurements in the PBS solution. One hundred
force curves were acquired over a 10 × 10 μm2 area from each location (three separate locations on each CoCol
gel sample) for analysis. The control experiment, without the presence
of a collagen film, was conducted on a titanium substrate. Overall
adhesion forces between the AFM tip and the collagen film, which is
reflected by the hysteresis between approaching and retraction curves,
were analyzed using Carpick’s toolbox, which is a suite of
MATLAB scripts.

X-ray Fluorescence
A high-resolution
measurement of
a 4.9 mL sample of 200 ppm CoCol gel was analyzed using a TORNADO
M4 XRF (Bruker, UK). A scan area of 100 ms pixel–1 was used with a speed of 30 m s–1 for three cycles.
Ten object areas were taken over the entirety of the scan area over
both high- and low-intensity regions. The differences in the height
of the peaks were measured, and the average difference is used to
give an increase in the relative concentration of cobalt ions. Mann–Whitney
test was performed to determine the statistics between average cobalt
counts with respect to high- and low-density areas.

Rheology
CoCol gels were prepared in Petri dishes at
a collagen concentration of 1 mg mL–1 and a gel
height of 1 mm. Samples were maintained at a temperature of 37 °C
for 5 min prior to measurement. Rheological measurements were taken
with an AR-G2 rheometer (TA Instruments), using a parallel plate geometry
with a gap of 1 mm. A sandblasted plate was used to minimize the wall
slip, and samples remained in the Petri dishes during measurement.
Strain sweeps were taken, at a frequency of 1 Hz, in order to establish
the limit of the linear viscoelastic region, the lowest value of which
was found to be 0.01, for samples doped with 200 ppm of cobalt. Frequency
sweeps were therefore performed at a strain of 0.01 over a frequency
range of 0.01–10 Hz.

Cell Culture
Mouse MC3T3-E1 (passage
23, ATCC CRL-2593)
osteoblast precursor cells were cultured in a α-minimum essential
medium (α-MEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) supplemented with 1% penicillin–streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK), 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), and
4% l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Cells were maintained
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 within a humidified incubator.

Confocal Fluorescent Imaging
CoCol gels, at a collagen
concentration of 1 mg mL–1, were gelled within a
12-well uncoated 10 mm glass diameter MatTek dish. For cell viability
experiments, MC3T3 cell suspensions were seeded at a density of 200 000
cells mL–1 onto the gel surface and grown within
the supplemented α-MEM (culture medium). In addition to this,
MC3T3 cells were seeded at the same density onto the base of the wells.
These were grown within the culture medium which had been doped with
cobalt concentrations of 0, 67, 133, and 200 ppm. After culturing
for 3 days, the medium was removed, and samples were washed with PBS.
Calcein AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) and propidium iodide (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, UK) dyes were prepared, with 300 μL added
to each well and incubated for 30 min. For morphology experiments,
MC3T3 cell suspensions were seeded at a density of 200 000
cells mL–1 onto the surface of the CoCol gel and
cultured for 3 days. The culture medium was then removed, and surfaces
of the CoCol gel were washed twice with PBS (as prepared above). Cells
were fixed within 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and washed as described
before. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5
min. Staining with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin and DAPI (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, UK) allowed for visualization of the cytoskeleton and
nuclei. Images were taken on a FV10-ASW confocal microscope with a
10× lens with image dimensions of 800 × 800 pixels.

MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromine)
Assay
MC3T3 cells were seeded into a 48-well plate at a density
of 7500 cells per well. Cells were initially cultured using supplemented
α-MEM for 24 h. This was then aspirated and replaced with a
cobalt-infused culture medium. Culture media containing Co(II) ions
were prepared by adding the stock cobalt solution to the supplemented
α-MEM up to a concentration of 200 ppm. The pH was adjusted
using 1 M sodium hydroxide to neutral and diluted to the desired cobalt
concentrations. Cells were cultured in cobalt media for a further
24 h prior to performing the MTT assay (Merck, USA). A stock solution
of sterile-filtered 5 mg mL–1 MTT (Sigma, UK) in
PBS was prepared and stored at 4 °C in light-deprived conditions.
After culturing for 3 days, cobalt media was aspirated and replaced
with 200 μL of supplemented α-MEM and 0.5 mg mL–1 of MTT within each well. This was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C
to allow for the formation of formazan crystals. The MTT and α-MEM
solution was then removed, and 200 μL of 0.22 μm sterile
filtered dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well. The plate was
then agitated for another 2 h at room temperature to dissolve formazan
crystals. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader
(Promega, UK). A one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine the statistics.

alamarBlue Assay
MC3T3 cell suspensions were seeded
onto the surface of the cobalt-doped collagen hydrogel at a concentration
of 200 000 cells mL–1 in 12-well plates.
After culturing for 3 days, the culture medium was aspirated, and
300 μL of fresh medium mixed with 10% alamarBlue dye (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, UK) was added. This was incubated at 37 °C
for 4 h before 100 μL of the medium was removed and placed into
a 96-well plate. Absorption was read at 570 nm. A two-way ANOVA was
conducted to determine the statistics.

Trypan Blue Assay
CoCol gels at concentrations of 0,
67, 133, and 200 ppm were gelled within a 12-well plate. MC3T3 cell
suspensions were seeded onto the gels at a concentration of 100 000
cells mL–1. Samples were cultured for 3 days within
a humidified incubator. In order to detach cells from the collagen
hydrogel, 0.1% collagenase was added to each sample followed by incubation
for an hour. To count cells, 100 L of media was added to 100 L of
trypan blue, to produce a diluting factor of 2, and both live and
dead cells were counted using a hemocytometer. A two-way ANOVA was
conducted to determine the statistics.

Raman Spectroscopy
Two 1 mL samples of 0 and 200 ppm
of cobalt-doped collagen gels were analyzed using the inVia Qontor
Confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw, UK). PBS was used as a buffer
within these gels to remove any additional signal from DMEM. A 60×
water immersion lens was used to obtain Raman spectra. An extended
scan over the spectral range of 100–4500 cm–1 was taken at random positions throughout each sample. Each scan
had a 30 s acquisition using a 785 nm laser with the pinhole in at
10% power. Thirty scans of each sample were obtained, with cosmic
ray removal performed on a wire. Averaging and normalizing of the
data were obtained using Microsoft Office 365 Excel (2013). Reduction
of the spectral range of 350–2650 cm–1 was
performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, 2007) to remove any background
effects.

Principal Component Analysis
Raman spectra from both
0 and 200 ppm CoCol samples were imported into MATLAB software (R2017a).
The data set comprised 60 spectra in total, 30 from each sample. Before
PCA, all spectra were normalized and reduced to a spectral range of
350–2650 cm–1 to remove any background interference.
Once PCA was conducted over the data set, principal components were
chosen based on the highest fraction of variance. Both the scores
and loadings values were plotted with respect to wavelength to aid
data interpretation.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Samples of 0 and
200 ppm of cobalt-doped collagen gels were analyzed using a METTLER
TOLEDO DSC 1 (METTLER TOLEDO, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland). Samples
were weighed into 46 μL aluminum DSC pans (METTLER TOLEDO),
capped with aluminum DSC lids (METTLER TOLEDO), and sealed with a
press (METTLER TOLEDO). This was calibrated with indium and zinc standards.
PBS was used as a buffer within the gels to remove any additional
signal from DMEM. Experiments were conducted under a nitrogen flow
rate of 50 mL min–1, and samples were heated from
25 to 135 °C after gelation at a rate of 5 °C min–1.
