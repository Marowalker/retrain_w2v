Herein, we report
the synthesis and characterization of a chemosensor, 5-(diethylamino)-2-(2,3-dihydro-1H-perimidin-2-yl)phenol (HL), synthesized from
a condensation between 4-(diethylamino)salicylaldehyde and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene.
Upon investigation of the sensing properties of HL, it
was found that this sensor may be employed for simple yet efficient
detection of Cu2+ in aqueous methanol solutions. The selective
and ratiometric response to Cu2+ yielded an outstandingly
low limit of detection of 3.7 nM by spectrophotometry and is also
useful as a naked-eye sensor from 2.5 μM. The system was studied
by spectrophotometric pH titrations to determine Cu2+ binding
constants and complex speciation. Binding of Cu2+ to HL occurs in 1:1 stoichiometry, in good agreement with high-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) results, Cu2+ titrations, and Job’s plot experiments, while the
coordination geometry was tentatively assigned as square pyramidal
by spectroscopic studies.

Introduction
The design and synthesis
of new chemosensors for the detection of trace metals, anions, and
small molecules continue to be strongly pursued due to their potential
for use in medical, biological, industrial, and environmental applications.1−16 Currently, the detection of biologically active metals such as Fe2+/3+,17,18 Cd2+,19,20 Hg2+,21,22 and Cu2+23−26 is receiving considerable attention due to their possible adverse
effects on human health.27 Of these metals,
copper is the third most abundant transition metal found in humans
and plays an essential role in several cuproenzymes.28 However, free copper is also able to oxidize cellular components
through its redox activity, damaging nucleic acids, proteins, and
lipids.29 Hence, an imbalance of copper
may be detrimental to human health, causing pathogenesis such as Parkinson’s
disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Wilson’s disease, Menkes
disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).30−32 In particular,
copper is a common pollutant due to its widespread usage in industry,
agriculture and drinking water systems. The World Health Organization
(WHO) has advised that 2 ppm (31.5 μM) is the recommended upper
level for copper in drinking water.33 Although
a considerable number of chemosensor systems have been developed for
copper(II) ions (Table 1), the design and successful construction of ultrasensitive and highly
selective systems, particularly those with naked-eye detection ability,
still represents a significant challenge.

Herein, we report a potential chemosensor,
HL (Scheme 1), capable of extremely fast colorimetric and ratiometric detection
of Cu2+ with an impressively low detection limit of 3.7
nM. Detection of copper at low micromolar levels is also possible
in the absence of a spectrophotometer, as the visible response of
HL to Cu2+ is significant. Spectrophotometric
acid–base studies were carried out in addition to several UV–vis-based
metal detection assays, ESI-HRMS, and electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) studies in order to probe the nature of the binding of HL to Cu2+ in terms of its sensing ability for this
metal ion.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of HL
Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Structure of HL
HL was synthesized from the condensation of
4-(diethylamino)salicylaldehyde and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene in isopropanol
in the presence of a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic
acid, as shown in Scheme 1. It was characterized via 1H and 13C NMR, ESI-HRMS, FT-IR, and STA (simultaneous thermal analysis) techniques
(Figures S1–S5). Single crystal
X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) studies demonstrate that HL crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbcn space group,
with cell dimensions of a = 25.524(5) Å, b = 13.835(3) Å, c = 9.914(2) Å,
and α, β, γ = 90°. A typical bifurcated hydrogen
bond is also observed between the hydroxide proton (O1H) and the dihydroperimidine
nitrogens (N1 and N2). These hydrogen bonds appear to result in the
dihydroperimidine nitrogens being positioned slightly above the plane
of the naphthalene ring and twist the plane of the salicyl moiety
so that the naphthalene and salicyl ring systems are almost perpendicular
(Figure 1). Both edge-to-face
and face-to-face π-contacts are present in the lattice between
the naphthalene moieties (Figure S6). Crystallographic
data is summarized in Table S1, and detailed
crystallographic information can also be found in the Supporting Information.

view. Bifurcated hydrogen H-bonding represented by dotted lines.

Screening of Metal Cations
The interaction with common metal cations was investigated using
20 μM solutions of HL in a MeOH/H2O
(1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) mixture by addition of two equivalents
(40 μM) of the cations. In the presence of Cu2+,
the absorbance spectrum develops immediately a strong absorption at
408 nm (ε = 3.815 × 104 M–1 cm–1) associated with generation of a yellow color
(Figure 2). Small peak
changes were also observed for Hg2+ and Fe3+, but importantly no other cations gave rise to an intense band centered
at 408 nm as observed for Cu2+. The sensing mechanism likely
involves a dual ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition
(an intense band at 408 nm) characteristic of a Cu2+ center
coordinated to a phenoxyl58−60 and naphthalene amine based61,62 ligand such as HL, which also incorporates an electron
donor diethylamino group.

of common metal ions. (b) Color changes observed by the naked-eye,
colorimetric detection for Cu2+ (yellow), while solutions

colorless.

Acid–Base Equilibrium
Studies
To characterize the acid–base properties of
HL and investigate its interaction with Cu2+, pH titrations monitored by UV–vis spectrophotometry were
performed for HL alone and in the presence of Cu2+. The main spectral features of HL varying with
a change of pH are the composite band at 310–350 nm assigned
to a intraligand π–π* charge transfer (CT) transition
from phenol and phenolate,58 the shifting
band at 260–280 nm assigned to a intraligand π–π*
charge transfer (CT) from naphthalene amine,61,62 and the increasing absorption band at 230 nm (Figure S7a). The spectral variations were fitted to a speciation
model containing three protonation equilibria (Figure S7b), and the protonation equilibrium constants obtained
are presented in Table 2. The highest protonation detected occurs around pH = 11 and is associated
with moderate spectral change, being assigned to protonation of the
phenoxyl group as found in similar functions.63 Around pH = 5.5, there is an intense spectral change likely associated
with protonation of the tertiary amine attached to the phenoxyl group.
Below pH = 3.5, there is a very small spectral change possibly arising
from protonation of one of the secondary amines of the dihydroperimidine
group.

In the presence of an equimolar
amount of Cu2+, the UV–vis spectrum of HL changes significantly on moving from acidic to basic pH with a new
band developing centered at ca. 408 nm (Figure S8). The spectral variations were in this case successfully
fitted to a speciation model containing three complex species corresponding
to different protonation states (Figure 3), and the complexation equilibrium constants
obtained are presented in Table 2. It should be stressed that all complex species found
are of 1:1 metal-to-ligand ratio. At lower pH, the complex exists
mainly as the species [CuHL]2+, while around
and above neutral pH, there are two hydroxo species formed likely
from deprotonation of water molecules coordinated to the metal center.
It is worth noticing that the [CuL]+ species
was not obtained in the data fitting, suggesting that it may only
exist in very low abundance in equilibrium, if at all. Thus, what
is observed corresponds to a double deprotonation step of the complex
from [CuHL]2+ to [CuL(OH)] around
pH = 4–5. The complexation constants obtained for this system
evidence a high thermodynamic stability of the complex formed between
HL and Cu2+, also resulting in the almost
complete absence of free Cu2+ above pH = 5 (Figure 3) under the conditions employed.

of CuCl2 versus pH (at 25 μM in MeOH/H2O 1:1).

Cu2+ Detection
Performance
The stoichiometry of the interaction between
HL and Cu2+ was also probed in buffered pH
by the continuous variation method (Job’s plot). The molar
ratios between HL and Cu2+ in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) medium were varied with
the combined molarity fixed at 50 μM (Figure S9). The intersect between the two fitted linear sections was
determined at a molar fraction of 0.50, confirming the 1:1 stoichiometry
of HL interaction with Cu2+ observed above
and also in agreement with the results from the ESI-HRMS (Figure S10) and Cu2+ titration experiments
(see below).

In order to determine the sensitivity of HL toward Cu2+ a metal titration experiment was
conducted in buffered pH, in which 5 μL additions of CuCl2 in aqueous solution were added to a cuvette with 20 μM
of HL dissolved in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES,
20 mM; pH = 7.00) mixture (Figure 4). Upon the addition of Cu2+ up to 20 μM,
a directly proportionate increase in the band at 408 nm was observed.
An isosbestic point was observed at 346 nm, occurring between the
peak maximum for HL (∼320 nm) and that for the
complex (408 nm), indicating a formation via a single equilibrium
step. Furthermore, after 20 μM had been added, no further spectrophotometric
change was observed, indicating saturation of HL with
1 equiv of Cu2+. This is in good agreement with the 1:1
stoichiometry found above. A linear relationship was observed on plotting
the ratio between the complex peak maximum and the isosbestic point
(408 nm/346 nm) absorptions versus the effective Cu2+ concentration,
indicating that this spectrophotometric change is ratiometric and
thus can be used to estimate the concentration of Cu2+ independently
of the HL concentration. The limit of detection (LoD)
and limit of quantification (LoQ) were calculated from this ratiometric
change of 408/346 nm, yielding outstanding values of 3.7 nM and 12.4 nM
respectively. To the best of our knowledge, HL proves
to be one of the most sensitive UV–vis-based chemosensors for
Cu2+ detection and is comparable to some of the highest
sensitivity fluorescence-based sensors so far reported (Table 1).

mixture. The peak associated with formation of the complex is at λmax = 408 nm. (b) The linear plot used for LoD and LoQ calculations
was obtained by plotting the absorbance ratio of the complex band
over the isosbestic peak.

To assess the naked-eye Cu2+ detection ability
of HL, we added increasing aliquots of Cu2+ to 20 μM samples of HL prepared in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) mixture and found that
the presence of Cu2+ becomes visually detectable at as
low as 1.5 μM and is clearly evident from 2.5 μM (Figure 5).

of CuCl2.

Cu2+ Detection Selectivity and Reversibility
The selectivity of HL for Cu2+ was also probed
in the presence of competing cations; UV–vis experiments were
conducted in which Cu2+ complexation was investigated in
solutions containing an excess of a competing metal ion. This was
carried out in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH =
7.00) medium, where HL was present at 20 μM, Cu2+ at 1 equiv (20 μM), and a competing cation in a 4
equiv (80 μM) excess (see UV–vis spectra Figure S11). As shown in Figure 6a, the selectivity of HL for
Cu2+ is unaffected by the presence of any of the competing
cations employed. In each case, the solution color observed by the
naked-eye is in good agreement with the UV–vis measurements,
with all solutions exhibiting a yellow color associated with formation
of the Cu2+ complex (Figure 6b).

nm. (b) Competing ion solutions as visible to the naked-eye; the detection
of Cu2+ by the observed color change to yellow remains
unaffected by other metal ions.

Reversibility studies employing ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid disodium salt (H2Na2EDTA) were undertaken
in order to probe the robustness of HL with respect to
its repetitive binding to Cu2+. As with previous experiments,
HL was prepared as a 20 μM solution in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) mixture. Initially Cu2+ was added at 1 equiv (20 μM), followed by 4 equiv
(80 μM) of EDTA4–. Subsequent cycles were
undertaken by adding a further 80 μM of Cu2+ followed
by 80 μM of EDTA4– (Figure 7). The addition of EDTA4– results in the disappearance of the band at 408 nm, while the further
addition of an excess of Cu2+ results in the reformation
of this band. As the absorbance peak (λmax = 408
nm) was not significantly affected after several cycling events, this
result indicates that HL is suitable as a reversible
sensor.

a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) mixture
at λmax = 408 nm after cycling with additions of
Cu2+ (20 μM initially, 80 μM thereafter) and
EDTA4– (80 μM).

Structural Study of the Cu2+ Complex
In
order to probe the binding mode of HL to Cu2+, we focused on the visible and EPR spectra of the complex. The EPR
spectra of frozen complex solutions in buffered MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) media, in the absence and also
in the presence of additional O- or N-donor atoms (respectively, DMSO
or pyridine, Figure 8), all unambiguously display a single species of rhombic symmetry
and a dx2–y2 ground state, consistent with elongated rhombic-octahedral
or distorted square-based pyramidal stereochemistry.64 The A hyperfine coupling constants and g factors of these complex samples obtained by spectral
simulation (Table 3) are indicative of either N3O or N2O2 equatorial coordination donor sets as seen from the values of g3 and A3,65 pointing to involvement of one O and 2 N donor
atoms from HL on the equatorial positions of the complex.
Additionally, the visible spectra obtained for samples under similar
conditions to those used for the EPR study (Figure S12) display two distinguishable absorptions (as shoulders
of the higher energy one) centered at the 610–620 and 730–750
nm regions, a feature that has been assigned to Cu2+ complexes
of square pyramidal geometry featuring strong axial bonding interaction.66,67 Thus, we propose that these spectroscopic results are in accord
with HL forming a distorted square pyramidal complex
in solution by coordination of Cu2+ to the phenoxyl O and
both secondary amine N atoms to define an approximate equatorial coordination
plane, with additional donors from the media completing the coordination
sphere at the remaining equatorial and axial positions of the metal
center.

Detection of Cu2+ in Tap Water
To evaluate the sensing potential of HL in real world samples, two tap waters suitable for human
consumption were taken from the Sydney area in New South Wales, Australia.
A third sample of known concentration (5 μM of CuCl2) was prepared using Milli-Q water and a standardized Cu2+ solution. These samples were prepared in a MeOH/H2O (1:1,
v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) buffered media with HL at
20 μM. The samples were analyzed using UV–vis, and the
ratio of their absorbance at 408/346 nm plotted against a linear calibration
plot (Figures S13 and S14). As shown in Table 4, the measured 5 μM
spike of each tap water, and the 5 μM laboratory prepared water
sample are in good agreement with the expected values. Thus, HL is suitable for the quantitative detection of Cu2+ far below the WHO guidelines of 2 mg/L (31.5 μM).

Conclusions
In
summary, we report an efficient colorimetric Cu2+ chemosensor
for use in aqueous methanol media. The sensor HL exhibits
an excellent ratiometric response, also visible by the naked-eye,
corresponding to a clear color change from colorless to yellow. In
addition, Cu2+ sensing is selective, being unaffected by
the presence of the wide range of other metal cations tested. In buffered
medium at pH = 7, an outstanding 3.7 nM limit of detection for Cu2+ was obtained in the low nanomolar range, one of the most
sensitive reported in aqueous media. Furthermore, the reaction stoichiometry
between HL and Cu2+ was unambiguously established
as 1:1, and the complexation is reversible employing EDTA4–/Cu2+ cycling. The coordination geometry of the formed
complex was also tentatively assigned as square pyramidal. The complexation
constants determined from the pH titrations point to the formation
of a thermodynamically stable complex that exists almost exclusively
as [CuL(OH)] in the range of pH = 5–8. According
to the preliminary results, the simplicity and effectiveness of this
sensor show great potential for real word applications in Cu2+ detection via qualitative (visible color change) and quantitative
(spectrophotometric) methods.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
All chemicals and solvents were of commercial grade and used without
further purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared with type
I water from a Milli-Q water purification system. Metal standards
were prepared from chloride (Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, K+, Ca2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ba2+ and Hg2+) or nitrate salts (Pb2+)
of analytical grade, then standardized using literature complexometric
titration methods with H2Na2EDTA.68

Synthesis of HL
The preparation
of HL was optimized from a literature procedure (Scheme 1).69 In a 50 mL round-bottom flask, 4-(diethylamino)salicylaldehyde
(1000 mg, 5.2 mmol), 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (825 mg, 5.2 mmol), and
a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA)
were combined and dissolved in isopropanol (30 mL). This mixture was
heated at 65 °C for 24 h, and the resulting precipitate was filtered
and washed with 50% isopropanol (H2O/isopropanol, v/v).
The product was then dried under vacuum at 40 °C, yielding 1.4
g (82%) of HL as a white crystalline powder. Crystals
suitable for SC-XRD were grown by slow evaporation of HL in an ethanol/acetone mixture (1:4 v/v). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6 with TMS, 300 MHz) δ (ppm) 9.16 (s.

262 nm (abs = 0.324, ε = 16 200).

General Methods
Characterization of HL was carried out using a range
of techniques. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured
on a Bruker DRX-300 NMR spectrometer. FT-IR measurements were conducted
on a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer. High resolution electrospray ionization
mass spectra (ESI-HRMS) were collected using a Waters Xevo QToF quadrupole
mass spectrometer with samples dissolved in methanol. Simultaneous
thermal analysis (STA) was undertaken on a Netzsch STA449 C Jupiter
thermo-microbalance. A PerkinElmer Lambda 45 UV–vis spectrophotometer
was used to conduct the Job’s plot and titration experiments,
while all other UV–vis works were performed using a Varian
Cary 100 spectrophotometer. Quartz cuvettes with a 1 cm optical path
length were used for all UV–vis measurements. Single crystal
X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) was undertaken at the Australian Synchrotron
on the MX1 beamline at 100(2) K with silicon double crystal monochromated
radiation.70 Data collection was through
Blu-Ice71 software, with data integration
and reduction undertaken using XDS;72 following
this, an empirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS
software.73 The crystal structure was solved
by direct methods, and the full-matrix least-squares refinements were
conducted using the SHELX74,75 suite of programs via
Olex2 interface.76

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
A 2.00 mM stock solution of HL was prepared in MeOH;
this solution was used for all spectroscopic experiments. Metal interaction
studies were conducted using 20 μM HL in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v, HEPES 20 mM, pH = 7.00) buffered mixture with
2 equiv (40 μM) of various chloride and nitrate salts. Competing
ion studies were prepared with a similar mixture, 20 μM HL in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v, HEPES 20 mM, pH = 7.00)
mixture. CuCl2 was added as 1 equiv (20 μM), with
competing metal ions added in a higher excess (80 μM). Job’s
plot measurements were undertaken using literature protocols,77,78 where HL and Cu2+ were prepared in various
molar ratios, with the combined concentration of both at 50 μM
in all analytical solutions. These molar ratio mixtures were prepared
in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v, HEPES 20 mM, pH = 7.00) buffered
mixture.

The complex formed by HL and Cu2+ was studied in more detail in the visible range using higher concentration
samples in both the absence and the presence of additional coordinating
compounds, namely, DMSO as a good O-donor and pyridine as a good N-donor.
These were prepared in buffered aqueous medium (HEPES 20 mM, pH =
7.00) containing both HL and Cu2+ at a 1:1
concentration ratio in the 0.78–1.0 mM range in the following
solvent mixtures (v/v): (a) MeOH/H2O 1:1, (b) MeOH/H2O/DMSO 2:2:1, and (c) MeOH/H2O/DMSO/pyridine 50:50:25:1.
In these spectra, the relevant bands (600–800 nm) appear as
shoulders on the more energetic band at ∼410 nm, so the maxima
of these absorptions were determined employing the second-derivative
method.

EPR Spectroscopy Studies
The electron paramagnetic
resonance spectra were measured on a Bruker EMX 300 spectrometer operating
at the X-band and equipped with a continuous-flow cryostat for liquid
nitrogen. Here, the complex formed by HL with Cu2+ was also studied in the absence and in the presence of additional
coordinating compounds, similar to the procedure used for visible
absorption studies. The samples were prepared in buffered aqueous
mixtures (HEPES 20 mM, pH = 7.00) containing both HL and
Cu2+ at a 1:1 concentration ratio in the 0.20–0.48
mM range in the following solvent mixtures (v/v): (a) MeOH/H2O 1:1, (b) MeOH/H2O/DMSO 2:2:1, and (c) MeOH/H2O/DMSO/pyridine 50:50:25:1. The EPR spectra of the frozen sample
solutions were acquired at 130 K at a microwave power of 2.0 mW and
a frequency of 9.5 GHz. The experimental spectra were then simulated
using the SpinCount software79 in order
to obtain the corresponding g factors and A hyperfine coupling constants. All spectra were successfully
simulated considering the presence of a single paramagnetic complex
species.

Equilibrium Studies
The equilibrium constants for the
protonation of HL and the formation of its Cu2+ complexes were determined by UV–vis pH titrations in the
range of pH = 3–11. The experimental setup used in these titrations
consisted of a closed titration vessel of 5–70 mL volume with
thermostat jacket set on top of a 801 magnetic stirrer and connected
to a Dosimat Plus 865 buret, all from Metrohm, as well as being coupled
to a Haake F3 thermostatic water circulator for temperature control.
All experiments were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C in MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v) medium at 0.10 ± 0.01 M in KCl, using standardized
KOH solutions in MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v) as titrant (at ca.
0.10 M for protonation and 0.02 M for complexation); a nitrogen atmosphere
was maintained in the titration vessel. The KOH titrant solutions
were prepared from dilution of a commercial ampule and standardized
using Gran’s method.80 The starting
solutions for titrations contained KCl at 0.10 M, HCl at 1.0 ×
10–3 M (for pH ≈ 3.0), HL at
2.5 × 10–5 M (and CuCl2 in equimolar
amount in the case of complexation), all in a starting volume of 20
mL. After each titrant addition, a sample of ca. 1 mL was taken from
the titration solution, placed in a 1 cm Hellma 114-QS cuvette and
measured on a PerkinElmer lambda 45 UV–vis spectrometer, after
which the sample was returned to the titration solution. The pH was
not measured experimentally; instead the proton concentration was
calculated from the addition volumes and concentrations of the titrant
solutions. The titration data were fitted using the HypSpec software,81 in the range of 240–370 nm in the absence
of Cu2+ or of 370–500 nm in the presence of Cu2+. Species distribution diagrams were plotted with the HySS
software at 25 μM of HL.82

Sensitivity Studies of HL with Cu2+
To determine the sensitivity of HL to Cu2+, a metal titration approach was used in buffered pH, where 5 μL
additions of CuCl2 aqueous solution were added to a cuvette
with 20 μM of HL dissolved in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) mixture, until no further spectral
shift was observed. The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantification
(LoQ) were calculated using 3σ/m and 10σ/m, respectively,83 where σ
is the standard deviation of a blank solution and m is the slope of the linear plot obtained. For the standard deviation
(σ) determination, we took 10 repeated spectra measurements
of a blank solution (HL solution in the same conditions
used for measurements but without any addition of Cu2+)
and calculated the standard deviation for the absorbance values at
408 nm, obtaining a value of σ = 2.34 × 10–4.

Detection of Cu2+ in Tap Water
Tap water samples
were taken from residential drinking taps in southeast (tap 1) and
northwest (tap 2) Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. An additional
sample of a known Cu2+ concentration (5 μM) was prepared
in Milli-Q water. To probe the accuracy and precision of HL, tap water solutions were also spiked with 5 μM of Cu2+, and all samples were measured with 5 replicates.

Quantitative detection of Cu2+ in these samples was carried
out by UV–vis spectroscopy with HL (20 μM)
in a MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v; HEPES, 20 mM; pH = 7.00) buffered
media. The ratiometric response taken from 408/346 nm was plotted
against a calibration curve in the same media. As the water sample
was 40% of the total in cuvette volume, a correction for sample dilution
was applied.
