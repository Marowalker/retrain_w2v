Bacterial
biofilms are responsible for persistent infections and
biofouling, raising serious concerns in both medical and industrial processes. These motivations
underpin the need to develop methodologies to study the complex biological
structures of biofilms and prevent their formation on medical implants,
tools, and industrial apparatuses. Here, we report the detailed comparison
of Escherichia coli biofilm development
stages (adhesion, maturation, and dispersion) on gold and titanium
surfaces by monitoring the changes in both frequency and dissipation
of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) device, a cheap and reliable
microgravimetric sensor which allows the real-time and label-free
characterization of various stages of biofilm development. Although
gold is the most common electrode material used for QCM sensors, the
titanium electrode is also readily available for QCM sensors; thus,
QCM sensors with different metal electrodes serve as a simple platform
to probe how pathogens interact with different metal substrates. The
QCM outcomes are further confirmed by atomic force microscopy and
crystal violet staining, thus validating the effectiveness of this
surface sensitive sensor for microbial biofilm research. Moreover,
because QCM technology can easily modify the substrate types and coatings,
QCM sensors also provide well-controlled experimental conditions to
study antimicrobial surface treatments and eradication procedures,
even on mature biofilms.

1 Introduction
Bacteria manifest two
modes of growth: planktonic, where the cells
are free to move in a liquid environment, and biofilm, in which the
cells grow onto a surface in a sessile state.1,2 In
the latter form, the microorganisms are closely packed on a solid
surface within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances
(EPSs). This viscoelastic scaffold constituted of proteins and polysaccharides
provides many structural and functional benefits such as improved
resources capture, adhesion to surfaces, digestive capacity, protection
against external agents, and prevention of bacterial dehydration.
Furthermore, the EPS matrix facilitates intercellular interactions
and horizontal gene transfer.3 Another
key feature of bacterial biofilms concerns the development of their
peculiar resistance against antimicrobial agents.4 This leads to persistent infections in humans because of
the contamination of medical devices,5 biofouling
and corrosion problems in industrial settings,6,7 and
major issues in wastewater treatments,8 which contribute to the rise of health care costs and economic losses.
Moreover, bacterial biofilms can be found on most surfaces in the
environment, whether natural9,10 or synthetic materials.2,5 Therefore, the significance of biofilms has motivated ongoing research
efforts to understand the mechanism of biofilm formation and to select
and/or engineer more efficient antimicrobial surfaces.11

Biofilm formation is a dynamic and complex
physiological process
involving different development stages12−14 (Figure 1), which should be considered when designing
strategies for biofilm treatments. First, the planktonic cells approach
the surface, where a conditioning layer is formed. This layer is composed
of organic and inorganic molecules that are either secreted by the
cells nearby the surface or settled from the bulk solution. Interactions
between the bacteria and the conditioning layer can facilitate microbial
adhesion. Consequently, physical interactions and bacterial appendages
allow the planktonic cells to adhere onto the surface (early adhesion).
As soon as the adhesion becomes irreversible, bacteria start multiplying,
forming clusters and producing EPS, thus losing their motility and
forming the initial biofilm (step 1 in Figure 1). The biofilm grows until it reaches its
maximum thickness, thus achieving the maturation stage (step 2 in Figure 1). As soon as the
biofilm reaches a critical mass, it starts to disperse planktonic
cells (step 3 in Figure 1). This dispersion process allows bacteria to swim back into the
bulk liquid for colonizing new surfaces.

Figure 1 Stages of biofilm development.
Bacteria appendages, such as curli,
drive cell adhesion onto solid surfaces (step 1). This interaction
is stabilized by the production of EPSs, which improve the attachment
and offer both mechanical and chemical protection for the bacteria.
Biofilm growth and maturation (step 2) is followed by the release
of free-floating bacteria for further colonization (step 3).

Traditional biofilm research focused their attention
on biofilms
formed on conventional surfaces, such as steel,15 plastic,16 glass17 surfaces in test tubes, 96-well plates,18 or flow cells.19 In
particular, there is an increasing interest in the selection, design,
and production of novel antimicrobial surfaces to prevent biofilm-associated
infections20−22 and biofouling.23,24 For instance,
Pappas et al.25 succeeded in killing almost
70% of a population of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by using a temperature-responsive
polymeric surface.

Several new methodologies have been developed
or adapted to biofilm
studies.26−28 Microtiter plate,29 Calgary
device,30 and the biofilm ring test31 provide high-throughput studies, but they do
not offer real-time investigation during the biofilm development stages.
Flow chambers32,33 and microfluidic34,35 systems allow the formation of the biofilm in situ with real-time
monitoring by optical detection methods,36 thus requiring the use of additional instrumentation. In addition,
the common microscopic techniques applied to study biofilms [i.e.,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM),37 atomic
force microscopy (AFM),38 and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM)39] are time-consuming
and expensive. Among these techniques, quartz crystal microbalance
(QCM) is a cost-effective and reliable technology for bacterial biofilm
studies. In fact, QCM has received increasing attention because of
its flexibility in investigating molecular recognition and surface
phenomena.40,41 In particular, QCM can measure
mass deposition/adsorption with a resolution of ≈1 ng/Hz, monitor
changes in the stiffness of materials adsorbed on the QCM sensor surface,42 and track various biological processes involving
DNA hybridization,43,44 antigen–antibody binding,45,46 and prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell adhesion responses to different
stimuli.47,48 More recently, QCM has been used as a sensor
platform to study the biofilm adhesion,49−51 the physiological and
genetic factors related to biofilm formation,52 and the effect of flow conditions over bacterial cells.53 In addition, the QCM sensing surface can be
easily functionalized with different types of materials.54−56 Specifically, Reipa et al.57 combined
the QCM device with reflectance measurements to track the formation
of the biofilm of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the gold sensor surface. They verified the presence of a mature
biofilm by confocal and fluorescence microscopy at the end of the
experiment. However, the reflectance measurements suffered from solution
turbidity and biofilm inhomogeneity. Another QCM-based approach to
capture the stages of biofilm formation of the bacterium Pseudomonas putida was developed by Sprung et al.58 In this work, biofilm formation was tracked
on either a pristine (i.e., clean gold) or a modified (i.e., Lipodex
E, concanavalin A, or phenanthrene) gold sensor surface. However,
independent validation of the presence and status of the biofilm using
other methods (e.g., microscopy and microbiological techniques) was
not provided. Recently, Amer et al.59 developed
a custom QCM multichannel system to improve the accuracy of the QCM
measurement with different bacteria. However, detailed information
on various biofilm development stages was missing. All these aspects
were recently reviewed by Alexander et al.,60 with extensive discussions on the factors affecting bacterial adhesion
and biofilm formation, modifications of the QCM gold sensor surface,
and modelling of the QCM response.

The interaction between bacteria
and the surface they interact
with has critical implications in biofouling and infections. For this
reason, it is important to develop reliable and flexible methodologies
to study biofilm formation on a wide range of materials. Since the
antimicrobial resistance of bacterial biofilms is a time-dependent
property,61−64 real-time analysis performed at high temporal resolution can shed
new insights to understand biofilm formation and identify optimal
eradication treatments. Because QCM offers both these advantages,
in the present work, we focused on the use of this technology to characterize E. coli biofilm formation in real time on two typical
metal surfaces: gold and titanium. Most of the existing work of using
QCM to study biofilm involves gold-based electrodes. Indeed, gold
is the most common metal used for QCM sensors41 and has the advantages of easy surface modification. Nevertheless,
the electrode of the metal/quartz resonators can be directly incorporated
in the QCM device to track biofilm growth under conditions resembling
real environments. Therefore, in this work, we investigated biofilm
formation not only on gold but also on titanium surfaces as titanium
has been widely used in implantable devices because of its corrosion-resistant
nature and biocompatibility.65

In
this work, E. coli biofilm development
stages are investigated directly on the QCM surface by monitoring
the sensor resonant frequency and energy dissipation signals for ≈24
h. Differences in terms of morphology and biomass between the biofilms
grown on gold and titanium electrodes are measured and confirmed by
AFM and crystal violet (CV) staining outputs. Finally, QCM technology
can be easily extended to other bacteria types and materials, thus
providing a general tool to investigate biofilm formation in real
time.

2 Results and Discussion
QCM is used
to track E. coli biofilm
formation and identify its development stages on gold and titanium
surfaces. The morphology of the formed biofilm is then characterized
by AFM directly on the metal sensor surface. Finally, both QCM and
AFM results are verified through the CV assay, a standard microbiological
staining technique used to evaluate biofilm biomass.

2.1 Real-Time
Observation of E.
coli Biofilm Development Stages on Gold and Titanium
Substrates
QCM with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) allows
to measure both the resonant frequency of the oscillating quartz and
the energy dissipation associated with the material adsorbed on the
sensor surface.41 Whereas negative changes
in the resonant frequency usually indicate an addition of mass on
the QCM, an increase in the energy dissipation is related to a reduction
in the stiffness of the material in contact with the sensor surface.

The QCM sensorgrams started recording when the E.
coli culture is set directly on the metal sensor surface
(Figure 2). Various
phases of the biofilm development can be distinguished based on the
frequency and dissipation values captured in the sensorgram, with
the focus on the data obtained 1 h after the culture medium was loaded
in the QCM chamber (vertical dashed line at the end of the red data
in Figure 2a–d).

Figure 2 QCM sensorgrams
of E. coli growing
on gold (a,c) and titanium (b,d). The color scheme highlights the
stages of the experiment: initial stabilization with culture medium
[red, (I)], biofilm formation [blue, (II)], maturation [yellow, (III)],
and release of free planktonic cells [green, (IV)]. (e,f) Panels show
the dissipation vs frequency plots for measurements performed on gold
and titanium, respectively.

Figure 2 illustrates
the QCM sensorgrams of E. coli’s
growth on both gold and titanium sensors. For the gold-based QCM measurements
(Figure 2a,c), the
sensor signals are stabilized in lysogeny broth (LB) [red data, (I)]
before loading the inoculum (vertical dashed lines at about 1 h).
This leads to bacterial adhesion and growth on the QCM electrode (see
stage 1 in Figure 1), which results in a progressive decrease in frequency and increase
in dissipation followed by signal stabilization at about 11 h [blue
data, (II)]. This behavior reflects the formation of a soft layer
of bacteria and EPS on the sensor surface. Both frequency and dissipation
signals remain stable for the next ≈6 h [yellow data, (III)],
meaning that the biofilm reached its maturation, and the viscoelasticity
properties of the attached layer remain unchanged. Next, at ≈17
h, bacteria start to be released in the liquid phase,1 causing a mass loss and an increase in the viscoelasticity
of the biofilm, which corresponds to the increase of both resonant
frequency and dissipation energy in the QCM sensorgram [green data,
(IV)]. At the end of the measurement, at ≈24 h after the loading
of the inoculum, the QCM sensor reaches final values of Δf and ΔD of −34 ± 5 Hz
and 40 ± 12 ppm, respectively.

Similar phases [i.e., incubation
with LB in red, (I); biofilm formation
in blue, (II); maturation in yellow, (III); dispersion in green, (IV)]
can be observed on the titanium substrate (Figure 2b,d). However, the overall frequency variation
on titanium is smaller but with larger noise than the one obtained
on gold (the final Δf value is −13 ±
14 Hz). On the other hand, the dissipation signal exhibits similar
profiles on both gold- and titanium-based QCMs until the biofilm reaches
the maturation phase [yellow data, (III)]. Subsequently, in the last
stage, the dissipation signal reaches much larger values on titanium
(the final ΔD value is 68 ± 19 ppm) in
comparison to the values on the gold electrode (ΔD 40 ± 12 ppm). Our observations suggest that the E. coli biofilm formed on titanium is less abundant
and more viscoelastic than those produced on gold. The comparison
of the QCM sensorgrams with two different substrate materials shows
that QCM is able to distinguish the effects of different materials
on biofilm formation. Further confirmation can be seen by the dissipation
versus frequency plots (Df plots shown in Figure 2e,f for gold and
titanium, respectively). In these graphs, the ΔD/Δf ratio highlights the structural properties
of the biofilm attached on the QCM. Briefly, a larger ΔD/Δf value corresponds to a more
viscoelastic film attached to the surface.

The incubation of
the gold surface with LB [red data, (I) in Figure 2e,f] produces a compact
layer on the QCM, which causes, on both Au and Ti, a significant change
in frequency but minor variations in dissipation. On the other hand,
all three phases of the biofilm development (II, III, and IV, shown
in blue, yellow, and green, respectively in Figure 2e,f) produce a much steeper trend on titanium,
indicating that the biofilm formed on Ti is softer than that produced
on Au.

2.2 Morphological Characterization of E. coli Biofilm via AFM and Biomass Estimation Using
CV Assay
After E. coli have
grown on QCM gold and titanium electrodes for 8, 16, and 24 h, the
resulting microbial biofilms are imaged by an atomic force microscope
operating in the tapping mode. The high spatial resolution offered
by AFM allows not only to image the single cells constituting the
biofilm but also to identify the contribution of the EPS matrix. Such
a detailed and time-dependent morphological characterization is missing
in many papers focusing on the use of QCM for biofilm study. Indeed,
this technique has proven to be extremely useful for characterizing
the bacterial biofilm morphology, bacterial interactions, and attachment
on surfaces.66 Therefore, we used AFM images
to correlate the biofilm structure at specific times with the stages
highlighted by the QCM sensorgrams. Growth and development of E. coli biofilms on gold and titanium QCM electrodes
are reported in Figure 3.

Figure 3 High-resolution AFM images of E. coli biofilm on gold (left panels) and titanium (right panels) QCM electrodes
at different growth times. The rows show the progressive magnification
of the bacterial biofilm (20 μm × 20 μm and 10 μm
× 10 μm areas, respectively) after 8, 16, and 24 h from
the loading of the inoculum.

The high-resolution images clearly show the biofilm development
stages both on gold and titanium. At 8 h (panels I, II, VII, and VIII),
the bacteria adhere onto the metal surfaces, start to aggregate, and
produce EPS, leading to biofilm formation. On gold (panels I and II),
more than half of the QCM gold electrode is already covered by bacteria
and EPS. On the other hand, only fewer bacteria adhere on the titanium
surface (panels VII and VIII), with a consequential lower amount of
EPS surrounding the microbial cells. At 16 h (panels III, IV, IX,
and X), the biofilms approach the maturation stage. In particular,
on gold (panels III and IV), we can clearly see the compact structure
constituted of bacteria and EPS. At the same time, on titanium (panels
IX and X), only ≈50% of the surface is covered by cells and
EPS. Finally, at 24 h (panel V, VI, XI, and XII), both single cells
in rod-shapes and biofilms are captured in the image, meaning that
the biofilm has reached the final dispersion stage by releasing free-floating
bacteria. On titanium, even though some areas present a completely
formed biofilm at 24 h (top left area in panel XI), the titanium surface
is not completely covered by the bacteria. These observations imply
that E. coli has higher affinity for
gold than titanium.

Additional verification of the QCM results
is obtained by the CV
assay. This staining procedure is one of the most common techniques
used to measure cell biomass and is routinely used to study biofilm
formation. Unfortunately, the fact that CV is a disruptive assay strongly
limits its use for time-dependent characterizations. In this technique,
the biofilm biomass is estimated by measuring the absorbance of the
stained sample at 570 nm. The greater the biofilm mass, the higher
the absorbance signal. We used the CV assay to measure the biofilm’s
biomass after 24 h of bacterial growth on the gold and titanium QCM
surfaces and on the plastic substrate of a 96-well microtiter plate,
which we used as the reference material. The results of the CV staining
are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 CV assay for E. coli grown on three
different surfaces: plastic (red), gold (blue), and titanium (green).
In all these tests, bacteria are grown for 24 h before staining. While E. coli reaches mostly the same biomass on both plastic
(reference) and gold, the bacteria produces a smaller biofilm on titanium.

The absorbance of sterile culture medium (LB, used
as background)
is almost the same on plastic (0.03 ± 0.01), gold (0.04 ±
0.01), and titanium (0.02 ± 0.01). After 24 h, the biomass of
the E. coli biofilm on the gold electrode
(0.69 ± 0.05) is similar to the one reached on the plastic plate
(0.69 ± 0.06), which is used as a reference surface. On the other
hand, the biofilm produced on the titanium surface is less massive
(0.44 ± 0.09). The CV results are consistent with the QCM measurements,
confirming the higher affinity of E. coli for gold over titanium substrates.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we demonstrate that QCM devices provide a cheap
and reliable alternative to conventional microbiological techniques
to study stages of biofilm formation in real-time with high temporal
resolution, without the need of any labelling or disrupting procedure.
The QCM results are in good agreement with the high-resolution imaging
provided by AFM as well as with the outcomes of the conventional CV
staining technique, thus confirming the reliability of the surface
sensitive device used in this work.

We show that the QCM system
allows the detailed real-time characterization
of the stages of bacterial biofilm development on both gold and titanium
for more than 24 h, thus proving the effectiveness of this sensing
platform in comparative studies on biofilm growth of different materials.
We also report that E. coli has higher
affinity and more abundant biofilm formation on gold sensors in comparison
to titanium sensors. Since the QCM surface properties can be easily
modulated and the sensor platform can be integrated with microfluidic
setups, this technology can offer an enormous range of opportunities
for investigating biofilm properties and development, screening for
biofilm specific drugs, developing antimicrobial surface treatments,
and designing biofilm eradication procedures.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Bacterial Growth
E.
coli (WT MG1655, Lab collection) is streaked on LB
agar (Sigma-Aldrich, L3022 and A1296) plates. The stock is kept in
glycerol at −80 °C. Single colonies are picked from the
plates and used to inoculate 20 mL of LB and grown overnight (≈16
h) at 37 °C under continuous shaking (200 rpm).

4.2 QCM
The QCM-D device (openQCM Q-1)
is purchased from Novaetech, Italy. Gold-quartz (QL0765) and titanium-quartz
(QL0763) oscillators are purchased from IEV, Italy. They are AT-CUT
quartz with a fundamental frequency of 10 MHz. The quartz crystal
and the metal electrode diameters are 1.37 and 0.6 cm, respectively.
The liquid is confined on the quartz oscillator via an open cell that
allows sample volumes up to 200 μL. The cell is closed with
a Teflon cover, and the whole sensing modulus is protected by a three-dimensional-printed
cap containing a water reservoir. This is critical to prevent sample
evaporation. Both resonant frequency and dissipation values are recorded
in real time via the manufacturer’s software. Data are then
analyzed using OriginPro 2017 (OriginLab).

4.3 Monitoring E. coli Biofilm Formation Using QCM
LB (200
μL) is loaded
into the QCM chamber, and when both the frequency and dissipation
signals are stable (it takes about 1 h from the loading of the LB),
1 μL of the overnight bacterial culture (equal to an initial
concentration of bacteria of about 2 × 107 CFU/mL) is then added to the QCM chamber. Both resonant frequency
and dissipation are monitored for 24 h. All measurements are performed
in triplicate.

4.4 Morphological Characterization
of Microbial
Biofilms via AFM
Microscopic characterization of E. coli biofilms grown on QCM gold and titanium surfaces
is performed using an atomic force microscope (Dimension ICON3 from
Bruker, Japan) equipped with aluminum back-coated cantilevers (OTESPA-R3,
Bruker, Japan) having nominal tip radius values ≈ 7 nm, spring
constant k ≈ 26 N/m,
and resonant frequency f0 ≈ 300
kHz. The microbial biofilms are imaged in the tapping mode with a
scanning speed of 1 line/s and a relatively high amplitude set-point
ratio (Asp/Afree ≈ 0.85) to reduce the risk of tip contamination.
Areas of 20 μm × 20 μm and 10 μm × 10
μm are scanned with a resolution of 512 pixels per line. All
measurements are performed in triplicate, and image analysis is performed
using NanoScope Analysis 1.8 software (Bruker, USA).

4.5 CV Staining
CV assay is a well-established
methodology used to quantify the mass of biofilms.67,68 Most of the existing CV staining protocols require that the bacteria
be cultivated on microtiter plates.69,70 In this work,
a custom procedure has been developed to stain the bacteria directly
onto the sensor surface to validate the results obtained with the
QCM device at the end of 24 h. First, a CV staining solution (0.5%)
is prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of CV powder (Sigma-Aldrich, C6158)
in 80 mL of distilled water, followed by addition of 20 mL of methanol.
The solution is gently mixed to completely dissolve the dye powder.
The bacterial biofilm is grown for 24 h in a standalone device consisting
of a quartz sensor and the open cell of the QCM device. Growing conditions
are similar to those used for growing bacteria on the QCM (wells are
filled with 200 μL of culture medium, and after 1 h, 1 μL
of the overnight culture is loaded). At the same time, as a control,
cells are grown under the same conditions in a 96-well plate at room
temperature. Each condition is tested five times, and wells containing
only the culture medium are used as the background. After 24 h, the
exhaust medium is aspirated, and the biofilms are washed twice in
a gentle stream of tap water. Then, the plate and the device are inverted
on a filter paper and tapped gently to remove any remaining liquid.
Next, 100 and 50 μL of 0.5% CV staining solution are added to
the sample well of the customized device and the 96-well plate, respectively.
Both the QCM device and the plate are then incubated for 20 min at
room temperature on a bench rocker oscillating at 20 rpm. Both electrodes
of the QCM device and the plastic substrate in the 96-well plates
are washed four times using tap water and then tapped on a filter
paper. Both the plate and the device are next air-dried for 24 h at
room temperature without lids. A methanol droplet (250 and 125 μL
for device and plate, respectively) is added to each well. Next, both
the plate and the QCM device are incubated for 20 min at room temperature
on a bench rocker at 20 rpm. Samples in the standalone device are
then moved to the multiwell plate. Finally, the absorbance at 570
nm is recorded using an ELISA plate reader (Multiskan GO from Thermo
Scientific).

4.6 QCM Surface Cleaning
QCM gold-coated
quartz substrates are cleaned by using the “piranha solution,”
a 3:1 mixture of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and 30%
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Since the piranha
solution is a strong oxidizing agent, it is commonly used in microelectronics
to remove organic contaminants from substrates. In the fume hood,
hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 216763) is slowly poured in a glass
beaker containing sulfuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 258105) resulting
in an extremely exothermic reaction. After the solution cools, QCM
sensor substrates are immersed with steel tweezers in the reactive
solution for about 2 min. Next, the substrates are washed with Milli-Q
water and dried with a gentle stream of nitrogen. This aggressive
chemical treatment allows QCM sensor substrates to be reused up to
four times.

Because the piranha solution etches the titanium
electrodes, the titanium surfaces are cleaned via sonication in acetone
and then isopropanol. Each step takes about 5 min. Finally, similar
to the gold electrodes, the titanium surfaces are rinsed with Milli-Q
water and dried with a gentle stream of nitrogen.
