Metal
halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have attracted significant
research interest in the next-generation display and solid illumination
fields due to their excellent optical properties of high photoluminescence
quantum efficiency, high color purity, obvious quantum confinement
effect, and large exciton binding energy. A large amount of surface
defects and nonradiative recombination induced by these defects are
considered as major problems to be resolved urgently for practical
applications of perovskite QDs in high-efficiency light-emitting diodes
(LEDs). Herein, we report an efficient passivation of green perovskite
QD CH3NH3PbBr3 with trioctylphosphine
oxide (TOPO). By simply adding the appropriate amount of TOPO into
the nonpolar toluene solvent to synthesize CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs, the surface defects of these as-synthesized
perovskite QDs are obviously reduced, along with an increased photoluminescence
lifetime and suppressed nonradiative recombination. Further investigation
indicates that electronegative oxygen from TOPO (Lewis base) bonds
with uncoordinated Pb2+ ions and labile lead atoms in perovskite.
With TOPO passivation, the green perovskite QD LEDs based on CH3NH3PbBr3 show significant performance
improvement factors of 93.5, 161.1, and 168.9% for luminance, current
efficiency, and external quantum efficiency, respectively, reaching
values of 1635 cd m–2, 5.51 cd A–1, and 1.64% in the eventual optimized devices. Furthermore, the presence
of TOPO dramatically improves stabilities of CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs and related devices. Our work provides
a robust platform for the fabrication of low-defect-density perovskite
QDs and efficient, stable perovskite QD LEDs.

Introduction
In recent years, perovskite
materials have attracted significant
research interest in photovoltaics due to their advantages of easy
synthesis, low cost, high absorption coefficient, and long carrier
diffusion distance.1−3 The power conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar
cells have remarkably increased from 3.8 to 23.6% over the past few
years.4−7 In addition to their high performance in photovoltaic fields, perovskites
have also been intensively investigated as attractive semiconductor
materials for other optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, and lasers.8−14 Especially, perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have shown tunable emission
color from the ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths,15 a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) of over
90%,16 and high color purity with a narrow
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of about 20 nm.17 Moreover, compared with bulk materials, QDs have exhibited
obvious quantum confinement effects and large exciton binding energies,18−20 and so they generally have a higher luminous efficiency. Since the
first hot-injection synthesis work of colloidal CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) reported by
Schmidt et al.,21 several methods for synthesizing
perovskite QDs have been developed, for example, the template-based
growth method,22,23 the ligand-assisted reprecipitation
technique,24,25 and the nonaqueous emulsion synthesis
method,26 and perovskite QD-based LEDs
have also become the focus of research work.27−29

In addition
to a high luminous efficiency, stability problem is
another key factor that restrains further applications of perovskite
QDs into LEDs. All-inorganic perovskite QDs, typical CsPbBr3 QDs, have shown the best thermal and chemical stability among all
kinds of perovskite QDs.30,31 Notably, the hot-injection
method is the best option for obtaining high-quality all-inorganic
perovskite QDs, but it requires inert gas protection and high-temperature
growth conditions, which conflict with low-cost consumption.32,33 Meanwhile, CsPbBr3 QDs cannot fully match the pure green
color (∼520 nm) in the National Television System Committee
chromaticity diagram because their photoluminescence (PL) peak wavelength
is located within a range of <520 nm, even though the size of the
CsPbBr3 QD is slightly larger than the exciton Bohr diameter.34 Compared with all-inorganic ones, CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs undergo extremely fast degradation
under moisture, oxygen, UV light, and high-temperature circumstances
due to the inherent instability of organic CH3NH3+ cations,35,36 but fortunately they have the
advantages of pure green emission and easy one-step room-temperature
(RT) synthesis by simply dropping their precursor solution containing
PbBr2, CH3NH3Br, oleic acid, n-octylamine, and N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) into a nonpolar solvent toluene.24 Surface defect site passivation is usually considered as a useful
approach to reduce surface defects and simultaneously enhance the
stability of perovskite QDs. Several groups utilized Lewis bases and
acids to reduce defect densities and improved performances of perovskite
films and devices.37−39 Koscher and Yang et al.40,41 reported the surface treatment of perovskite QDs with inorganic
salts, for example, thiocyanate, sodium nitrate, etc. Additionally,
ligand-exchange methods were also used to enhance the PL performances
of perovskites.31,42 Unfortunately, the above-reported
methods have been rarely applied in organic–inorganic hybrid
perovskite-based electroluminescent (EL) devices due to the limited
conductivity of perovskite QDs after treatment. In addition, researchers
have also used tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetramethyl orthosilicate,
and (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane to synthesize silica-coated perovskite
NPs,43−45 but the shell thickness has a notable influence on
device performances due to the insulative characteristics of silica.
These NPs are usually used for down-conversion luminescence devices.

TOPO, as a kind of alkylphosphine oxide, is a commonly coordinating
material during the synthesis of II–VI and IV–VI quantum
dot systems.46−48 In 2016, Ginger et al. post-treated CH3NH3PbI3 with TOPO, realizing organic–inorganic
hybrid perovskite films with PL lifetimes exceeding 8 μs.49 Sun et al. reported that TOPO treatment can
dramatically improve the stability of CsPbX3 NCs against
ethanol treatment.50 Manna et al. used
TOPO instead of aliphatic amines to synthesize bright, size-tunable
CsPbBr3 QDs with narrow size distributions and high yields.51 You et al. first reported efficient green perovskite
LEDs based on a quasi-two-dimensional composition, and the PL lifetimes
were significantly increased by coating TOPO onto the perovskite film
surface, with which green LEDs reached a current efficiency (CE) of
62.4 cd A–1 and an external quantum efficiency (EQE)
of 14.36%.52 Despite significant improvements
in the film quality and device performances, particularly for two-dimensional
perovskites, TOPO has not been applied in organometallic halide perovskite
QDs yet and its influence on the electrical properties of LEDs remains
unclear. Herein, we deduce that TOPO as a passivation material is
also suitable for organic–inorganic halide perovskite QDs due
to the large surface-to-volume ratio and a large number of defects
on the QD surface. In You’s work,52 it is noteworthy that the entire QD film cannot be completely passivated
using the above-mentioned post-treatment technique since this technique
is mainly aimed at the passivation of the film surface. To solve this
problem, we add TOPO into toluene, a key nonpolar solvent, for forming
perovskite QDs to sufficiently passivate the surface defects of these
QDs. By optimizing the TOPO doping concentration, we fabricate highly
efficient green perovskite QD LEDs with the maximum luminance, CE,
and EQE values of 1635 cd m–2, 5.51 cd A–1, and 1.64%, showing improved factors of 93.5, 161.1, and 168.9%
compared with those of control devices without any treatment. Meanwhile,
CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs and LEDs also show
significantly improved stability after TOPO passivation.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a schematically
illustrates the typical synthesis process of perovskite QDs. A mixture
of CH3NH3Br, PbBr2, oleic acid, and n-octylamine was dissolved into DMF to form a precursor
solution, and then a fixed amount of the precursor solution was dropped
into toluene mixed with TOPO under vigorous stirring at RT. With the
addition of precursors, yellow-green colloidal solutions are formed
(Figure 1b), and under
the illumination of a 365 nm ultraviolet lamp, all QD samples show
very bright green light emissions, which from left to right are denoted
as Control, TOPO-50, TOPO-100, and TOPO-150, respectively, corresponding
to TOPO addition amounts of 0, 50, 100, and 150 μL. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of the as-synthesized CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs at various TOPO concentrations
and their corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns (Figure 2a–d) indicate
the presence of monodisperse cubic-shaped QDs with high crystallinity.
The HRTEM images show that the lattice spacing and the FFT patterns
are well-defined spots that are in accordance with the crystallographic
parameters for the CH3NH3PbBr3. The
TEM (left images in Figure 2a–d), HRTEM (upper right images in Figure 2a–d), and FFT (bottom
right images in Figure 2a–d) show a QD size of ∼6±2 nm and an interplanar
distance of 2.96 Å, which correspond to the (200) crystal face.
The statistical data on QD diameters in Figure S1 demonstrate slightly smaller sizes for QDs with TOPO passivation
compared with their Control counterparts. The QD size will increase
first and then slightly decline with a continuous increase in the
doping TOPO amount.

To clearly observe the passivation effect of TOPO and better
elucidate
its influence on the radiative recombination of QDs, we measured the
PLQY of the CH3NH3PbBr3 QD solution
by using a fluorescence spectrometer equipped with an integrating
sphere, with an excitation wavelength of 405 nm. The PLQY for the
series of RT-synthesized CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs with a variable concentration of TOPO increases from 44% for
the control sample to 66% (TOPO-50), 67% (TOPO-100), and 69% (TOPO-150).
We also characterized the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay curves of
these CH3NH3PbBr3 film samples at
the same excitation wavelength of 405 nm, with the corresponding measurement
results presented in Figure 3a. The recombination lifetimes were extracted from the TRPL
decay curves with the biexponential fitting function of I(t) = Afe–t/τf + Ase–t/τs. Here,
τf and τs are the fast and slow
decay lifetimes, respectively, and Af and As are their respective decay amplitudes. The
average lifetime (τavg) is calculated with τavg = Afτf + Asτs. Generally, fast decay represents
trap-assisted recombination at the crystal surface and the long-lifetime
component means radiative recombination inside the crystals.53Figure 3a and Table 1 clearly indicate that the PL kinetics of the TOPO-passivated QDs
is slower than that of the control without any modification. CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs passivated with TOPO show
relatively long PL lifetimes compared with their counterpart without
TOPO, indicative of the suppression of nonradiative recombination
via a reduction in electronic trap sites. Figure 3b shows the PL spectra of CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs. As the concentration of TOPO increases,
the PL peak position of the QDs shows a slight red shift of 3 nm (from
518 to 521 nm), whereas the FWHM of the PL spectra remains at ∼23
nm regardless of the TOPO concentration, and this result is consistent
with previous reports.49 The slight red
shift in the PL spectra is unrelated to compositional changes at the
grain boundaries and variations in crystallinity.49 Moreover, the TOPO treatment does not trigger a microscopic
restructuring of CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs,
as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure S2). The XRD patterns clearly display the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite characteristic peaks at 14.9,
21.2, 30.1, and 35.2°, which correspond respectively to the (100),
(110), (200), and (210) crystal planes of a cubic phase structure.54 Compared with the Control sample, the two small
peaks of TOPO-150 located at 21.2 and 35.2° indicate that the
introduction of TOPO increases the crystallinity of the QDs on both
the (110) and the (210) crystal planes. However, the small peak at
14.4° of samples indicates that a small amount of PbBr2 was present in the perovskite films, which was always located at
the grain boundary.55 As the concentration
of TOPO increases, the gradual disappearance of that small shoulder
may be attributed to the action of TOPO on PbBr2. Furthermore,
the FWHM of the diffraction peak for these TOPO-treated samples remarkably
becomes wider than that of the Control, meaning that the smaller QDs
are obtained with the use of TOPO. However, with the continuous increase
in TOPO concentration, the FWHM of these TOPO-treated samples becomes
narrow, indicating that larger QDs are then obtained with more amount
of TOPO used. On the whole, the size of the QDs passivated with TOPO
is smaller than that of the Control counterpart, which is consistent
with statistical results of HRTEM images (Figure S1).

a All of the samples were fitted with
a biexponential function.

The organic small molecule TOPO is a typical example of L-type
ligands (Lewis bases), which is able to bind to electron-deficient
(electrophilic) surface sites of perovskite QDs with undercoordinated
metal ions and further generate a fine surface passivation effect.56 To confirm this point, Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy measurements on TOPO, PbBr2, and TOPO-passivated
PbBr2 film were performed, with the corresponding result
shown in Figure 3c.
No obvious peak occurs in the FTIR spectra of PbBr2 in
a wavenumber range of 900–1800 cm–1 mainly
due to the location of PbBr2 characteristic peaks at 200
and 64 cm–1.57 An observable
absorption peak located at 1150 cm–1 in the control
TOPO film corresponds to the P=O bond stretching vibration,
whereas this P = O bond absorption peak shifts to approximately 1100
cm–1 in the film comprising TOPO:PbBr2, indicative of the bond formation between PbBr2 and TOPO.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) determinations were also performed
to further investigate the surface properties of colloidal CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs (Figure S3). Figure 4a–d shows the Pb 4f XPS spectra of the resulting QDs. The
XPS spectra of Pb 4f for all samples have two symmetric peaks, which
are respectively attributed to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels. Both Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 peaks from
TOPO-modified samples slightly shift toward lower binding energies
compared with those of the control counterpart. In addition, both
Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 can be further fitted
with two peaks, where the high-energy peak comes from the contributions
of Pb–Br bonding (136.1 and 141.0 eV) and the low-energy one
originates from the metallic Pb (134.3 and 139.0 eV). With the increase
in TOPO concentration, the metallic Pb peaks (134.3 and 139.0 eV)
disappear and the Pb2+ peak intensities at 136.1 and 141.0
eV decrease, both of which indicate that the introduced TOPO will
strip off the labile lead atoms and uncoordinated Pb2+,
leaving perovskite QDs with fewer surface defects.58 The O 1s peaks shown in Figure S4 can be fitted into two peaks. The small band centered at 529.8 eV
can be associated with the oleic acid bound on the QD surface, whereas
the peak of the O 1s core level at a high binding energy can be originated
from oxygen bound with lead atoms. Notably, the high-energy peak of
all TOPO-modified samples is centered at 530.3 eV, slightly higher
than those of the control counterpart at 530.0 eV, indicative of the
bond formation between the electronegative oxygen and the uncoordinated
Pb2+/metallic Pb.59,60 The Br 3d peaks shown
in Figure S5 can be divided into two peaks
of 66.2 and 67.2 eV, corresponding to the inner and surface Br ions,
respectively. Both peak intensities decline with the increasing TOPO
amount, revealing the possible reaction of TOPO with PbBr2.52,56 The N 1s spectrum of CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs (see Figure S6) shows two peaks with binding energies of 398.0 and 399.5 eV, implying
the existence of two chemical conditions of the N element. The peak
with a binding energy of 398.0 eV can be assigned to the presence
of n-octylamine in the CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs, whereas the peak at 399.5 eV originates from
methylamine.60

(d) 150 μL of TOPO.

This part verifies the TOPO’s influence on CH3NH3PbBr3 QD stabilities by locating
them within
a RT ambient atmosphere. A group of QD solutions with different TOPO
addition amounts were simultaneously measured for a comparison. According
to the photographs shown in Figure S7,
the fresh Control QDs without TOPO obviously aggregated into large
particles 5 h later and then precipitated from the solution after
5 days of being present in ambient atmosphere at 20 ± 2 °C
and 50 RH%, whereas the TOPO-passivated samples significantly prolonged
lifetimes of CH3NH3PbBr3 QD solutions.
The greater the amount of TOPO we added, the longer the lifetime achieved.
With the addition of 100 μL and 1 mL of TOPO, denoted as TOPO-100
and TOPO-1000, respectively, the aggregation time can be delayed to
3 and >20 days, respectively. We summarized solution stabilities
of
perovskite QDs from recently published literature into Table S1. The statistics indicate that all-inorganic
perovskite QDs universally have significantly longer lifetimes than
their organic–inorganic counterparts, reaching more than 4
months.61 In contrast, most of the organic–inorganic
perovskite QDs, even with the encapsulation of an inorganic salt matrix
or oxide shell (NaNO3, SiO2, etc.), still show
a relatively short life of under 1 month or several days.41,43,45 However, insulated layer encapsulation
or shell layer protection prevents carrier transportation within films,
thus restraining its further applications in the light-emission layer
of LEDs. Our organic–inorganic perovskite QDs are comparable
to or slightly better than the organic–inorganic ones with
a potential applied into the EL layer.21 Based on the above analysis, the efficient passivation and stability
improvement in CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs indicate
a potential application of our perovskite QDs in LEDs, particularly
used as a good candidate for a highly efficient EL layer.

In
some literature, excessive ligands or long-chain ligands protect
QD surfaces with reduced defects and improved stability and realize
a high PLQY with unity, but they also trigger poor carrier injection
and transportation in the eventual assembled film, which will seriously
damage the EL performances of devices.54,62,63 To verify the influence of TOPO employment on electrical
transportation and EL properties, we prepare perovskite QD LEDs with
device structures of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS, 40 nm)/poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK, 40 nm)/TOPO-passivated
CH3NH3PbBr3 or CH3NH3PbBr3/1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene
(TPBi, 45 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (Figure 5a) and then test the device performances. Here, ITO
and Al are respectively used as the anode and cathode, PEDOT:PSS and
PVK are respectively used as the hole-injection and transport layers,
TPBi and LiF act as the electron-transport and injection layers, respectively,
and the CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs with or without
TOPO passivation are employed as the emitting layer. According to
the amount of TOPO added, four different devices with 0, 50, 100,
and 150 μL of TOPO are named as LEDControl, LEDTOPO-50, LEDTOPO-100, and LEDTOPO-150, respectively. All devices exhibit an emission
area of 10 mm2 and a major EL peak at 520 nm with a FWHM
of ∼22 nm (Figure 5b), coincident with the peak of the PL spectra. However, unfortunately,
an obvious shoulder at ∼440 nm occurs along with the CH3NH3PbBr3 emission in most of the devices,
which originates from the emission of the hole-transport layer PVK,
as shown in the EL spectra of QD LEDs in Figure S8. It is worth noting that we clearly observe gradual declines
of the PVK shoulder with increasing amounts of TOPO, and as the amount
of TOPO added into toluene rises to 100 μL, the LED shows a
pure green CH3NH3PbBr3 emission with
a 520 nm peak and a 22 nm FWHM, whose Commission Internationale de
L’Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates are mainly located at (0.144,
0.732). The illustration in Figure 5b shows a working image of the QD LEDTOPO-100 under a 6 V bias, indicating that the device displays bright and
uniform emission under normal working voltage (see Supporting Information Movie S1). The current density–voltage
(J–V), luminance–voltage
(L–V), CE–voltage
(CE–V), and EQE–voltage (EQE–V) characteristics for all devices are plotted in Figure 5c–f, and the
electrical output characteristics of the devices are summarized in Table 2. The performances
of the perovskite QD LEDs are optimized by altering TOPO concentrations,
and the optimized amount of TOPO added is 100 μL. The QD LEDTOPO-100 device exhibits a turn-on voltage (Von) of 3.25 V and maximum brightness, CE, and
EQE values of 1635 cd m–2, 5.51 cd A–1, and 1.64%, respectively, which are significantly better than those
of other devices. It can be observed that the device’s current
density gradually decreases with the increasing TOPO concentration,
which is mainly due to the insulation property of TOPO. When an appropriate
amount of TOPO is added, the performance of the perovskite QD film
layer is improved owing to its effective passivation, which is beneficial
to the highly efficient radiative recombination of carriers in the
emitting region, with brightness significantly improved. Although
the introduction of high-concentration TOPO can effectively passivate
the surface defects of perovskites, its insulation property will in
contrast reduce the charge injection into QDs and eventually affect
the electrical injection and transport abilities of devices, leading
to a significant decrease in both CE and EQE (Figure 5e,f).

Device stability is a necessary
parameter to evaluate perovskite
LEDs, and so we tested the half-lifetimes of 32 sets of LEDs with
and without TOPO, with statistic results shown in Figure S9. Here, the half-lifetime (T50) is defined as the degradation time corresponding to 50%
of the initial luminance. It should be noted that all devices were
measured in an ambient atmosphere at RT and 50 RH%. As a result, T50 values for the TOPO-passivated and control
devices are respectively about 7 min and 44 s, indicative of the beneficial
effects of TOPO passivation on device stability. Table S2 lists some stability-related literature about perovskite
QD devices published recently. From Table S2, we notice that the half-lifetimes for LEDs with all-inorganic perovskite
QDs as the emission layers are universally longer than those with
organic–inorganic ones,64,65 but notably our devices
represent the best level among organic–inorganic perovskite
QDs.

Conclusions
In summary, to overcome surface defect-induced
nonradiative recombination
and enhance emission performances, we offer a simple and effective
approach of employing TOPO to passivate CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite QDs. Prior to dropping the perovskite
precursor into the nonpolar toluene solvent, we add different concentrations
of TOPO into toluene and find that the electronegative oxygen from
TOPO can passivate the labile lead atoms and uncoordinated Pb2+ ions in CH3NH3PbBr3 by
forming coordinate bonding, leading to a reduced surface trap density
and an increased radiative lifetime and PLQY in the resultant perovskite
QDs. With the optimal TOPO amount to treat CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs, we eventually obtain 93.5, 161.1, and 168.9%
improvements in luminance, CE and EQE, reaching 1635 cd m–2, 5.51 cd A–1, and 1.64%, respectively. Moreover,
TOPO passivation significantly improves CH3NH3PbBr3 QD solution and device stability. This work provides
a method for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite QD films and
highly efficient, stable perovskite QD LEDs.

washed with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water in sequence, followed
by ultrasonic cleaning with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol
for 15 min, respectively. Then, the PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated
onto the ITO-coated glasses at 3000 rpm for 45 s, followed by a drying
process of 120 °C for 30 min. The solid PVK was dissolved in
CB solution to prepare a 10 mg mL–1 PVK solution,
and then the PVK solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer
at 3000 rpm for 45 s to form a PVK layer, followed by a drying process
of 120 °C for 30 min. After that, these glasses were moved into
a glovebox to spin-coat the CH3NH3PbBr3 QD layer via a five-step spin-coating with rotation speeds of 5000,
4000, 4000, 4000, and 4000 rpm in sequence, followed by a 30 min RT
annealing. Finally, all samples were transferred into a vacuum chamber
to evaporate TPBi (45 nm), LiF (1.2 nm), and Al electrode (100 nm)
under a high vacuum of 1 × 10–4 Pa,
forming the perovskite QD LEDs with the structure schematic shown
in Figure 5a.

Characterizations
The shape and size of the perovskite
QDs were measured with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Hitachi,
HT7700) and a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Talos, F200X). The crystal
structures of CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films
were characterized using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffraction equipment.
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured on IRPrestige-21.
The current density–voltage–luminance characteristics
and EL spectra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 QD LEDs were measured with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter and a coupled
PR655 Spectra Scan spectrophotometer. All measurements were carried
out at RT under ambient conditions. The UV–vis absorption spectra
of perovskite films were obtained using a PerkinElmer Lambda 650 S
spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The PL
spectra and the PL lifetimes of perovskite QDs with and without TOPO
were measured with an IK series (Kimmon Koha, Japan) and a pulse laser
at 375 nm (EI, FLS920), respectively. The absolute PLQYs of all CH3NH3PbBr3 QD solution samples were characterized
with a Quantaurus-QY absolute photoluminescence quantum yield spectrometer
(C11347-11, Hamamatsu Photonics) equipped with an integrating sphere
under an excitation wavelength of 405 nm. The wide spectra together with N, Br, O, and Pb spectra
of perovskite QDs were measured with XPS (Kratos Axis Supra).
