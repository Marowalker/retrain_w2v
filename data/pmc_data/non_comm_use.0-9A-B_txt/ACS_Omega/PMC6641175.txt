Lanthanum hexaboride
(LaB6) is notable for its thermionic
emission and mechanical strength and is being explored for its potential
applications in IR-absorbing photovoltaic cells and thermally insulating
window coatings. Previous studies have not investigated how the properties
of LaB6 change on the nanoscale. Despite interest in the
tunable plasmonic properties of nanocrystalline LaB6, studies
have been limited due to challenges in the synthesis of phase-pure,
size-controlled, high-purity nanocrystals without high temperatures
or pressures. Here, we report, for the first time, the ability to
control particle size and boron content through reaction temperature
and heating ramp rate, which allows the effects of size and defects
on the vibrational modes of the nanocrystals to be studied independently.
Understanding these effects is important to develop methods to fully
control the properties of nanocrystalline LaB6, such as
IR absorbance. In contrast to previous studies on stoichiometric LaB6 nanocrystals, we report here that boron content and lanthanum
vacancies have a greater influence on their vibrational properties
than their particle size.

Introduction
Previous studies have
shown that lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) nanocrystals have
tunable plasmonic properties that allow
for strong absorption in the IR region.1 These particles are cheaper and easier to synthesize than gold nanorods
or nanoshells, which exhibit similar behaviors.2,3 Recent
work has also suggested that LaB6 nanocrystals may be solubilized
with the incorporation of a ligand, which may make them more readily
accessible to be used in films for various studies.3 These properties lend LaB6 nanocrystals to a
variety of potential applications, such as thermally insulating window
coatings,4−6 biomedical imaging,2 and
heat sensing.7 As a bulk material, LaB6 is mechanically strong and is a common thermionic emitter
used for cathodes in tools like transmission electron microscopes.8

The majority of previous studies have focused
on bulk metal hexaborides,
paying little attention to nanoscale behaviors. Many materials display
novel properties in the nanoscale that they do not display in the
bulk. For example, macroscopic platinum is one of the least reactive
metals but platinum nanocrystals or nanocubes are known catalysts,7,9−11 speeding up oxidation in catalytic converters, nitric
acid production, as well as other widespread industrial processes.12 Gold nanocrystals behave in a similar manner,
becoming catalytic at the nanoscale and absorbing in different optical
ranges compared to those of bulk gold in aqueous solution, with size-dependent
colors ranging from red to purple.13−15

Because of past
difficulties in synthesizing LaB6 nanocrystals,
studies of this material on the nanoscale have been relatively scarce.
Traditional methods require very high temperatures even to synthesize
bulk samples, and the nature of this pulverization process unfortunately
introduces unavoidable impurities. We have recently described the
synthesis of LaB6 nanocrystals at 360 °C using lanthanum(III)
chloride and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and shown that
the size of the nanocrystal changes the vibrational energies of the
hexaboride cluster.3 Intriguingly, the
size of the anion of the lanthanum salt (chlorine or iodine) reagent
involved in this lower-temperature synthesis had an even larger impact
on the vibrational energies than the nanocrystal size.16 Neither of these phenomena has been thoroughly
quantified.

LaB6 nanocrystals have a highly symmetric
structure,
and yet numerous studies indicate that the vibrational energies are
very complex, influenced by factors like size and crystalline defects
and even by the anion of the reaction.17 No previous study has separated the influence of size and crystalline
defects on the vibrational modes of the crystal structure. In this
study, we have delineated the relationship of the nanocrystal structure
with the particle size and defects in the crystal structure with Raman
and IR spectroscopies. LaB6 nanocrystals were synthesized
over a wide range of temperatures in a 1 in. tube furnace. We varied
the nanocrystal size and crystal defects through reaction time and
heating ramp rate. As a result, we were able to separate the influence
of particle size and crystal defects on the vibrational modes of the
system. Systemically, we show for the first time that boron content and lanthanum
vacancies have a larger influence on the system than particle size
and, furthermore, that significant evidence exists supporting that
the boron cage structure behaves like a net, allowing for ion capture
in some situations.

Results and Discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of LaB6 when
varying 1 h reaction temperatures from 400 to 700 °C using a
60 °C/min heating ramp rate (Figure 1A). Particle sizes were estimated from the
diffraction patterns using the Scherrer equation via JADE,18 with sizes ranging from approximately 5 to 13
nm depending on the reaction temperature. In the reactions, there
is a linear increase in particle size from 500 to 700 °C and
a linear decrease in size from 400 to 500 °C (Figure 1B). The high heating ramp rate
(60 °C/min) together with the relatively short reaction time
at 400 and 450 °C accounts for the larger-than-expected particles.
The fast heating resulted in uneven nucleation, causing larger particles
to develop early in the reaction, which cannibalized the smaller particles
that formed as the reaction progressed. This is a well-documented
process known as Ostwald ripening.19,20

(NIST) LaB6 standard (“bulk” size) and LaB6 nanocrystals synthesized from 400 to 700 °C, with a
heating ramp rate of 60 °C/min, and (B) calculated sizes of LaB6 nanocrystals synthesized at various temperatures.

We previously reported the synthesis of 2–5
nm LaB6 nanocrystals synthesized at 360 °C on a Schlenk
line, with
a much lower heating ramp rate of 10 °C/min.16 Given that this relatively low ramp rate produced much
smaller nanocrystals than we obtained in the 60 °C/min tube furnace
reactions, we performed the same 1 h LaB6 reaction at 450
°C using the lower heating ramp rate of 10 °C/min. This
slower heating produced smaller nanocrystals, which fit within the
linear relationship of reaction temperature to nanocrystal size (Figure 2). We also synthesized
LaB6 at 700 °C and the 10 °C/min heating ramp
rate and found very little change in particle size compared to that
at the 60 °C/min reaction and this high temperature.

Figure 2 Sizes of LaB6 nanocrystals synthesized with varying
reaction temperatures, heating ramp rates, and reaction times. Ramp
rate refers to how quickly the tube furnace was heated from ambient
temperature to the reaction temperature, whereas reaction time refers
to the time between reaching the desired temperature and stopping
the reaction. (The data point at 360 °C was previously reported
for a Schlenk line synthesis and is included for comparison.4)

In our previous report, we found that it is possible to synthesize
larger nanocrystals simply by increasing the reaction time from 1
to 2 h.16 We synthesized LaB6 in a tube furnace at 450 °C with a reaction time of 2 h and
a heating ramp rate of 60 °C/min and found the opposite effect,
where the 2 h reaction produced smaller particles (approximately 6
vs 9.5 nm; Figure 2). This supports our earlier conclusion that Ostwald ripening has
a major influence on particle size when the reaction is quickly heated.
At lower temperatures, the reaction is more sensitive to the ramp
rate and can generate nanocrystals with unexpected sizes due to the
unreacted precursor, which leads to unrestrained Ostwald ripening.
Below 400 °C, the 60 °C/min heating ramp rate is too high
and does not allow for a complete reaction within 1 h.

Elemental
analysis was performed using energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) spectroscopy, and the results are plotted in Figure 3. For the sake of consistency,
all elemental analysis results in this study are reported as %B. The
pink horizontal dotted line in the figure shows the atomic percentage
of boron in stoichiometric LaB6, where the ratio of La
to B is exactly 1:6. For nearly all reaction temperatures, there was
a higher level of boron and a lower level of La than those of a stoichiometric
sample, suggesting that any defect in the crystal structure is a result
of lanthanum vacancies. This is consistent with previous studies that
found 2–3% lanthanum vacancies in bulk LaB6 crystals
prepared with stoichiometric precursor ratios.21,22 Additionally, shifts as small as 1% in the weight percentage of
lanthanum in the bulk crystal were responsible for the color change
from purple to blue. In this study, two sets of samples have the same
size with different atomic percentages of boron (7.4 nm nanocrystals
with a %B difference of 3.2% and 6.2 nm nanocrystals with a %B difference
of 4.5%). Shifts in the %B of this magnitude are significant. Additionally,
the same size of the two sets of nanocrystal samples eliminates the
complication that decreasing nanocrystal size introduces. As nanocrystal
size decreases, the surface-area-to-volume ratio increases. This increases
the %B content of the nanocrystal without any additional lanthanum
vacancies due to the B3 structures present on the surface.

Figure 3 Atomic
mass percentage of B vs reaction temperature, with a pink
horizontal dotted line representing the atomic mass percentage of
B in stoichiometric LaB6 (31.8% B).

Interestingly, the lanthanum vacancies do not have a linear
relationship
with the reaction temperature. For a typical 1 h reaction heated at
a rate of 60 °C/min, the %B resembles a pulse shape, with a peak
at 450 °C. Lanthanum vacancies of particles synthesized using
the lower 10 °C/min heating rate decreased at 450 °C while
increasing at 700 °C, an intriguing result. Generally, lower
ramp rates have been shown to decrease defects in nanocrystals, such
as silicon23,24 and zinc oxide.25 One explanation for the lower ramp rate increasing the
lanthanum vacancies in LaB6 at 700 °C is that the
cage structure of the boron lattice expands during heating and contracts
during cooling, like a net, depending on the energy of the system,
which allows the La3+ cations to either incorporate or
escape. This expanding and contracting cage-like structure was suggested
in our previous report, where thermogravimetric analysis and XRD results
demonstrated the possibility of removing anions trapped within the
LaB6 structure.16 At a lower
temperature, the cage would be “tighter” compared to
that at a higher temperature, with a wider cage allowing the release
of lanthanum atoms and their reincorporation into the precursor salt,
LaCl3. Physical boron structures displaying cage-like structure
are not unprecedented but are recent. For instance, B40 was reported in 2014 and described as having a fullerene’s
cage-like structure,26 suggesting that
other large boron cage structures could exist as well. By conducting
Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses,
we provide further evidence for this expanding and contracting cage
structure interpretation, which will be discussed in detail below.
As the boron atoms of the unit cell are pushed closer together or
pulled further apart, their vibrational energies change and display
new behaviors compared to those of the bulk material, which are reflected
in their Raman and IR spectra.16

Both the %B and the nanocrystal size change significantly at 450
°C when the ramp rate is changed, which is likely due to the
melting point (400 °C) of NaBH4. The reaction just
starts at 400 °C, whereas 450 °C is a more stable temperature,
where the particles have had more time to nucleate during the ramping
process. With a ramp rate of 60 °C/min, a reaction run at 450
°C will have been at a temperature of 400 °C for slightly
less than a minute (50 s exactly), whereas at 10 °C/min, the
same 450 °C reaction would have been at or above 400 °C
for 50 min.

XRD Characterization
Our results show that lanthanum
vacancies do not shift XRD patterns in any appreciable way. LaB6 nanocrystals with size of approximately 7.3 nm (synthesized
at 700 °C, with a 60 or 10 °C/min ramp rate) and B content
of 35.0 and 31.8% were compared, and no shift in diffraction data
was noted (Figure 4A). LaB6 nanocrystals with size of approximately 6.2 nm
(synthesized at 650 °C for 1 h, with a 60 °C/min ramp rate,
and at 450 °C for 2 h, with a 60 °C/min ramp rate) and B
content of 33.5 and 38% (Figure 4B) also showed no notable change in the diffraction
peaks. There is occasionally an extraneous peak present at 32°,
which is visible in Figure 4B. This peak is due to the presence of residual sodium in
the sample that was not successfully removed during the processing
phase.

Figure 4 XRD patterns of LaB6: (A) 7.4 nm particles with differing
%B content, (B) 6.2 nm particles with differing %B content; (C) 46%
B content with differing particle size, (D) 34% B content with differing
particle size.

In contrast to this result,
LaB6 nanocrystals with identical
boron content but varying particle size have notable shifts in the
diffraction data. In LaB6 nanocrystals with 46% B (synthesized
for 1 h at 500 and 450 °C, with a 60 °C/min ramp rate) and
sizes of 5.4 and 9.6 nm (Figure 4C) as well as nanocrystals with 34% B and 6.3 and 12.8
nm particle sizes, there is an obvious XRD shift. In both cases, where
%B is constant, there is a consistent shift to lower 2-Theta values
with decreasing particle size. This suggests that smaller particles
have a more compressed crystal structure. This result also suggests
that the defects in the system do not appreciably change the overall
crystal structure lattice spacing.

In situ measurements of the
LaB6 reaction are currently
ongoing at the Advanced Light Source. Although it is not possible
to correlate in situ diffraction results with the actual boron content
of the final product, the data highlight the importance of controlling
the ramp rate and temperature when synthesizing LaB6. As
seen in Figure 5A,
a very high heating rate (300 °C/min) for a 400 °C reaction
does not produce LaB6, but a much lower heating rate (5
°C/min) clearly allows the formation of crystalline LaB6 particles. These results complement the discussion above with regard
to the melting point of NaBH4. When the reaction is run
at 400 °C, the reactants need time to interact and a slow heating
rate is required to allow particles to nucleate. Holding the reaction
at 400 °C then allows the particles to grow larger. When the
reaction is run up to 600 °C (Figure 5B), the small nucleated particles that form
at a low ramp rate are not given enough time to grow at the needed
lower temperature and crystalline LaB6 is not observed.
Interestingly, a high ramp rate (300 °C/min) for the 600 °C
reaction clearly results in LaB6 formation. It is possible
that there is a different reaction mechanism at play, given this is
beyond the decomposition temperature or NaBH4 or this may
be because of how nucleation changes when the reaction happens so
quickly. Full details of the in situ reaction results will be reported
in our next study.

in situ
reactions run for 30 min at (A) 400 °C and (B) 600 °C with
5 and 300 °C/min ramp rates.

Raman Characterization
Although defects (lanthanum
vacancies) in LaB6 do not significantly influence the diffraction
patterns as much as particle size, defects within the lattice have
a strong influence on the vibrational properties of the system that
are observable through Raman spectroscopy. Common defects, such as
particle vacancies or interstitial defects, shift all of the atoms
in the crystal structure slightly, which can be observed by changes
in the Raman vibrational modes. Figure 6 illustrates the Raman-active vibrations for LaB6. In LaB6, the vibration modes corresponding to
the bending (T2g) and stretching (Eg and A1g) of the octahedron boron cluster are Raman active. The vibration
of the lanthanide metal within the boron cage (the “rattling
mode”) and the movement of lanthanum with respect to the boron
cage (“acoustic” or T1u) are also Raman active.

Figure 6 Raman-active
vibrational modes of LaB6; “rattling”
mode, T1u vibration (displaying one unit cell), bending
vibration of T2g, and stretching vibrations of Eg and A1g.

We compared the Raman spectra of LaB6 nanocrystals
of
the same size but differing vacancies as well as nanocrystals of differing
sizes and the same vacancy. In LaB6 nanocrystals with 34%
B and a 6.5 nm difference in size (6.3–12.8 nm), there is an
average blueshift of 4.7 cm–1 in the Raman spectra
with increasing particle size, with the exception of the rattling
mode, which does not shift (Figure 7A). In our previous study, we demonstrated that the
rattling mode shifts when the nanocrystal size is less than 5.4 nm,
most likely due to volumetric constriction as the cage space shrinks;16 therefore, it is not surprising that there is
no shift in this mode, as both the nanocrystals are larger than 5.4
nm. Additionally, in that same study, we found that the majority of
Raman shifts for all modes are present in nanocrystals between 5.4
and 2.5 nm in size, with an average peak shift of 19.4 cm–1, with little to no peak shift between the bulk crystal and 5.4 nm
nanocrystals. However, it is important to note that this study did
not control for lanthanum vacancies. Larger nanocrystals are generally
more stable because, as the surface-area-to-volume ratio becomes smaller,
the relative contribution of the high-surface-energy terms is minimized.
In contrast, LaB6 nanocrystals with 46% B and a 4.2 nm
difference in size (5.4–9.6 nm) show no change in the T1u and T2g modes of the Raman spectra, a redshift
of the A1g stretching mode of 8.0 cm–1, and blueshifts of the rattling and Eg modes of 3.9 and
2.7 cm–1, respectively (Figure 7B). Although the LaB6 nanocrystals
with 46% B may have more lanthanum vacancies, this differing result
is likely due to complications involved with changing particle size.
In smaller nanocrystals, surface effects influence Raman spectra more
strongly than in larger particles. It has been reported that the (111)
surface of LaB6 is terminated with B3 groups,16,27 so the excess of B on these smaller samples may be more a result
of the increased B3-containing surface than that of vacancies
within the system. Small changes in nanocrystal size cause the surface
area to grow considerably because the surface area is proportional
to the square of the nanocrystal radius. The 5.4 nm particles are
more strongly influenced by the B3 groups on the surface
than the 6.3 nm particles, explaining why the Raman shifts between
the 6.3 and 12.8 nm particles are easily understood while they are
more complex between the 5.4 and 9.6 nm particles.

Figure 7 Raman spectra of samples
with differing vacancy values and nanocrystal
sizes, including T2g, Eg, A1g, and
rattling and T1u (inset) vibrations for (A) 34% B content
with differing particle size, (B) 46% B content with differing particle
size, (C) 7.4 nm particles with differing %B content, and (D) 6.2
nm particles with differing %B content.

Finally, increasing the %B content by 3.2% (from 31.8 to
35%) in
7.3 nm particles results in a blueshift of all Raman-active peaks
by about 10.9 cm–1 (Figure 7C). Increasing the B content by 4.5% (from
33.5 to 38%) in smaller (6.2 nm) particles gives the same result,
where all Raman-active peaks blue-shift by about 9.9 cm–1 (Figure 7D). These
samples show a clear pattern of increased %B content blue-shifting
the Raman energies of all modes because they are of the same size,
eliminating complications introduced by different surface areas. The
missing lanthanum atoms in the nanocrystal boron cage structure lower
the overall energy of the system.

FTIR Characterization
The FTIR spectra largely demonstrated
the same trends as the Raman spectra; it is important to note that
increasing the %B content demonstrated a straightforward pattern of
blue-shifting the FTIR spectra and that nanocrystals larger than 5.4
nm are less affected by surface area B3 structures, demonstrating
simple blueshifts. LaB6 samples with 34% B that increase
in size by 6.5 nm (6.3–12.8 nm) show an average blueshift of
41.7 cm–1 (Figure 8A). Considering that this growth represents a fourfold
increase in the surface area of the nanocrystal and thus a significantly
shrinking surface-area-to-volume ratio, the surface effects of the
B3 surface groups, which should decrease the overall energy
of the system, do not appear to be especially substantial for this
size range.

Figure 8 FTIR spectra of samples with (A) 34% B with differing nanocrystal
size and (B) 7.4 nm nanocrystals with differing %B.

Increasing lanthanum vacancies also tends to blue-shift
the FTIR
spectra. Increasing the boron content by 3.2% (31.8–35.0%)
in 7.4 nm LaB6 particles shifts the T2g peak
to lower energy, extending beyond the detection limit of the FTIR
(Figure 7D). The average
measureable IR peak shift in nanocrystals of varying boron content
was 113 cm–1, which is significantly higher than
the influence of size alone. The plasmonic properties are affected
by the distribution and overall density of electric charge in the
crystal system. It is possible that some boron atoms replace some
of the lanthanum vacancies or even incorporate throughout the lattice,
given boron’s small atomic radius, both of which would alter
the plasmonic character of the nanocrystal without necessarily changing
the particle size. The particle size is generally more straightforward
to control; however, changing the composition and symmetry of the
system would likely cause more dramatic shifts in the plasmon absorbance.
Lanthanum vacancies lower the overall energy of the system, which
is consistent with the Raman spectra. Additionally, as these particles
are of the same size, there is no influence from surface effects,
and the different boron content must be due to lanthanum vacancies.
This lends more evidence to the interpretation that lanthanum atoms
are escaping from the boron cage lattice at some point during synthesis
and lowering the energy of the system.

Conclusions
Understanding
how to tune the vibrational properties of LaB6 is crucial
for the fine manipulation of optical properties.
This study is the first, to our knowledge, on the independent influence
of boron content and nanocrystal size on the vibrational properties
of LaB6 nanocrystals. We have shown that the nanocrystal
size of LaB6 has a strong dependence on the heating ramp
rate at temperatures below 500 °C and that the particle size
and the boron content can be controlled by changing the heating ramp
rate (60 vs 10 °C/min) as well as the reaction time and temperature.
XRD patterns show no visible change with changing boron content, whereas
increasing nanocrystal size shifts XRD spectra to higher 2-Theta values,
suggesting that the crystal structure is being stretched with increased
size.

Studying the influence of particle size on vibrational
energies
was more complicated. In general, increasing the particle size blue-shifted
the Raman and FTIR spectra. It is apparent that the boron-terminated
surface of tiny nanocrystals, lanthanum vacancies, and excess interstitial
boron affects the vibrational properties to different degrees. More
vacancies lower the energy, whereas a higher surface-area-to-volume
ratio increases the energy. The study of the exact behavior of the
LaB6 nanocrystal surface is ongoing and will be reported
in a future publication. In particles of the same size, both the Raman
and FTIR spectra consistently shift to lower energy with increasing
boron content. The excess boron must largely be due to lanthanum vacancies
because the particle sizes are the same, which means that additional
B3 surface structures could not be responsible for the
boron content disparity. Even though lanthanum is not energetically
favorable, it is still incorporated within the cage structure, suggesting
that other atoms could potentially be trapped as well and explaining
the results of previous studies that found that the anion (Cl– or I–) of the lanthanum salt precursor
seemed to be incorporated into the cage structure.16 Improving our understanding of the boron cage structure
of LaB6 could open the door to studying ion-trapping applications,
better heat sensors and biomedical imaging particles, and possibly
entirely new materials on the basis of forcibly doping the cage structure
with novel elements.

Experimental Methods
Starting materials
were stored in an argon glovebox and used as
received. Anhydrous lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) of 99.9%
purity was purchased from Strem Chemicals. Reagent-grade NaBH4 was purchased from EMD Millipore Corporation. Methanol, 0.5
M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and deionized (DI) water were used in air
for processing the samples after synthesis. The samples were synthesized
under a flow of argon over a range of temperatures in a Lindberg tube
furnace with a 1 in. diameter quartz tube. Small ceramic furnace boats
approximately 2 in. long and 1 cm wide held the sample within the
furnace tube. LaB6 samples were analyzed by powder X-ray
diffraction technique on a Bruker D8 Discover operated at 35 kV/40
mA using Co Kα radiation. A LaB6 NIST standard was
used as a bulk sample. Data on Raman spectra were collected on a Horiba
Jobin Yvon LabRAM ARAMIS automated scanning confocal Raman microscope
at the excitation of 532 nm. Elemental analysis was performed by EDX
spectroscopy on a Zeiss Gemini Ultra-55 scanning electron microscope,
and FTIR spectroscopy was performed on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One
equipped with HATR assembly.

Nanocrystalline LaB6 was synthesized via the following
method: first, LaCl3 and NaBH4 powders (1:6
molar ratio) were ground together with a mortar and pestle in a glovebox
under argon with a slight excess of NaBH4, to ensure there
is enough boron present to make contact with the salt. Approximately
1 g of the mixed powder was placed in a ceramic furnace boat and transferred
into a 1 in. Lindberg tube furnace, then heated at a given temperature
(between 360 and 700 °C) under an argon flow rate of 0.4 slm
using the desired heating ramp rate (60 or 10 °C/min), held at
the reaction temperature for 1 or 2 h, and then cooled to room temperature.
The samples were then treated with methanol until bubbling ceased,
to remove excess NaBH4, and centrifuged at 10 000
rpm for 10 min. The obtained black solid was treated with 15 mL of
0.5 M HCl until bubbling ceased (typically overnight, but up to 4
days, depending on the reaction temperature), to convert any residual
sodium metal to sodium chloride, and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm
for 10 min. Finally, the samples were washed with three 20 mL portions
of DI water to remove sodium chloride.
