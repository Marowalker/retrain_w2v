Suspended
micromechanical structures are typically formed by dissolving
underlying spacer material. However, capillary force-induced collapse
during solvent removal can damage soft structures. If instead capillary
forces are directed in the plane, they can drive liquid polymeric
bridges to directly transform into suspended fibers. The various capillary
force-directed methods for fabricating arrays of suspended fibers
have suffered from either low manufacturing rates or an inability
to produce arbitrary patterns. Shape transformation photolithography
(STP) demonstrated herein is a method of producing arbitrarily patterned
arrays of suspended fibers that are potentially capable of high fabrication
rates. In STP, holes are prepatterned in a polymer nanofilm supported
on a micropillar array, and then the film is heated above its glass
transition temperature. First, the holes expand by dewetting and then
capillary forces drive thinning of the polymer channels defined by
the holes. Prepatterning overcomes the energy barrier for hole nucleation
and ensures that all fibers form at the same time and with similar
diameters. Arrays of fibers and fiber lattice networks are formed
from dyed polystyrene films that are patterned with nanosecond laser
pulses at 532 nm. The exposure threshold for forming holes is 10.5
mJ/cm2 for single pulses and 3.3 mJ/cm2 per
pulse for repetitive pulsing, which is only about 3× larger than
the dose available from current 193 nm wafer-stepping projection printers
that are used in device manufacture. With the increased absorption
of polystyrene at 193 nm and with additional proposed material modifications
to the thin film, it may even be possible to employ STP in production
wafer steppers at economically feasible manufacturing rates of over
50 wafers/h.

1 Introduction
There have been several
recent studies on the formation of polymers
into patterned arrays of suspended fiber air bridges with diameters
from microns down to a few nanometers. These methods include point-to-point
fiber drawing from melted1 or solvated
polymers,2−5 drawing5 or electrospinning6 over a substrate that is rotating and translating
in synchronism with the polymer jet, direct-write from an electrospinning
jet in close proximity to the substrate,7,8 and brushing
on2 or withdrawing9 solvated polymers from an array of micropillars resulting in an
array of suspended fibers. These fiber bridges can have very high
aspect ratios of 1000:1 or greater, and correspondingly low bending
stiffnesses. Because these structures assemble from material that
is suspended at some distance above the substrate, capillary forces
(rather than inducing collapse, a common failure mechanism for flexible
microstructures that are made by undercut and release using liquid
solvents) drive threads of polymeric fluids to thin and solidify into
suspended structures. Depending on the polymer concentration, molecular
weight and extension rate, fiber geometry due to capillary thinning
can vary from near constant diameter10 to
bead-on-a-string structures of regularly spaced single and multidiameter
beads.11 Under conditions of ongoing polymerization
and slow enough brushing speeds, arrays of suspended membranes form
that resemble trampolines, with each membrane anchored between four
pillars.12

These various structures
can be used directly as micromechanical
elements or serve as templates for fabricating suspended structures
from other materials. An example of templated fabrication with these
structures is that polymer air bridges filled with nanomaterials have
been decomposed to produce suspended bridges of nanowires, nanotubes,
and graphene.13 Another example is that
overcoating air bridges with various materials followed by decomposition
or dissolution has been used to fabricate suspended capillaries out
of both organic and inorganic materials,2 and overcoating has even been used to template complete, electrokinetically
pumped micronscale flow cells.14 Other
more exotic multifunctional microsystems that could be built from
these processing steps are considered in ref (15). Therefore, compared to
traditional lithographic processes of deposition, patterning, and
release by undercutting, these various approaches to forming suspended
polymer structures offer ways to self-assemble very flexible and delicate
structures, in the third dimension above the substrate, and with fewer
steps and less likelihood of capillary force-induced snap-down.

However, all these methods of directly fabricating fiber air bridges1−9 suffer either from low manufacturing throughput, in the case of
serial direct-write methods, or from a limited range of geometries
(basically, only periodic arrays) that can be patterned by brush-on
methods and synchronized electrospinning. In this report, we introduce
shape transformation photolithography (STP), a method to form much
more general and arbitrary patterns of fiber bridges.

In STP
(Figure 1), a micropillar-suspended
nanofilm is optically prepatterned, followed
by thermal annealing during which the low-resolution patterns transform
through capillary thinning into a defined pattern of fiber bridges.
Prepatterning of holes overcomes the otherwise uncontrolled nucleation
of holes at random times and locations and the undesirable evolution
of these holes into fibers of widely varying diameters, orientations,
and random breaking times.16−18 Here, we experimentally demonstrate
that the prepatterned films can be formed by photolithography, which
enables, for the first time, a parallel method of capillary force-directed
self-assembly that produces arbitrarily defined patterns of suspended
fibers.

Figure 1 STP: method and demonstration of the transformation of a polymer
thin film (the 80 nm thick region of film 6) into patterned arrays
of polymer fiber air bridges. (a) Three-dimensional schematic view
of the method. (b) Photographs of the film before patterning and at
various stages of the thermal anneal as the film transforms from holes
into fibers. (c) Wider field of view of the film in (b) during early
hole expansion. The unpatterned areas (outside the dotted box) have
many randomly nucleated holes. The temperature has just reached 97
°C when the nuclei first appear. In (d) where the temperature
has reached 125 °C, the nuclei expand to produce a random pattern
of fibers, while the prepatterned areas (inside the dotted box) have
transformed into a well-ordered array of fibers in (d).

A perspective on the significance of the method
can be gained by
considering the degree to which this process is compatible with current
tools used in the mass production of integrated circuits, specifically,
in terms of available optical energy and exposure throughput rate
(which is dictated by economic arguments about return on investment).
The rate-limiting step for STP, and photolithography in general, is
pattern exposure (because the thermal annealing and membrane attachment
steps can be performed on an entire wafer, or even a cartridge of
prepatterned wafers all at the same time.)

We specifically consider
compatibility of STP with the widely deployed
193 nm wavelength production steppers that use excimer laser light
sources (that produce nanosecond pulses at kilohertz rates) which
currently dominate the manufacture of computer processors and memory
chips. (Only recently have 13.5 nm extreme UV steppers begun to be
used in chip manufacture.) The 193 nm wavelength is strongly absorbed
by many organic polymers,20−22 many of which have been employed
as photoresists, including polystyrene (PS), which is considered in
this report.

For STP to be used in production setting, it is
necessary that
holes be patterned in the polymer films with the fluence available
from these steppers (around 0.3–1.1 mJ/cm2, see Table 2 in Section 3). While previous reports
and experiments presented herein suggest that the exposure threshold
of PS is somewhat higher than the levels available from production
steppers, other polymers and modifications to PS are expected to have
lower exposure thresholds (which is discussed in Section 3.1).

2 Results
This section presents several experimental demonstrations of STP.
The process (documented in Materials and Methods) is summarized in the schematic (Figure 1a). A polymer thin film mounted on a micropillar
array is optically patterned with holes by laser exposure. The holes
may be simple round holes or more complex patterns (as shown in Figures 1–4). Upon heating
to a point where the polymer can flow, the holes expand and transform
to threads that bridge pairs of pillars. These threads thin further
into fibers of nearly constant diameter over most of their length.

Figure 2 Evolution
of a prepatterned film (film 6, 80 nm region) into suspended
fibers. Each photograph (a–h), taken in a chronological order,
is annotated with the temperature at the time the photograph was taken.
The temperature was either increasing with time or held constant for
a specific duration. The hold time at which a photograph is taken
is also noted. The dark spot to the right of the “UofL”
pattern is residue from the destruction of a pillar by unintentionally
illuminating it with the laser while prepatterning the film. The fiber-thinning
characteristics do not appear to be affected by proximity to the residue.
There are additional periods where film-to-fiber transformation appears
unchanging. These are 2.5 min between 25 and 95 °C, 8 min between
114 and 120 °C and 2 min between 120 and 126 °C. The scale
bar applies to all panels a–h.

of images) leads to different structures forming during annealing
(bottom row of images). (a) Holes centered between four pillars produce
fibers in x and y. (b) Holes centered
between each pair of pillars in a group of four pillars form lattice-like
structures. (c) At the junction between hole patterns centered between
four pillars, like (a), and centered between two pillars, like (b),
additional fiber forms in y that are thinner than
the fibers to the left. The scale bar applies to all six panels of
the figure.

and (c) 26.6° from horizontal. The pitch of the (silicon) pillars
is 40 μm in (a) and 30 μm in (b,c).

In these experiments, PS films and 532 nm lasers (initially,
continuous
wave and later, nanosecond pulsed) were used. PS absorbs almost no
light at this wavelength, so the films are dyed to a level approaching
the absorbance of pure PS at 193 nm. The threshold fluence that we
find for forming holes at 532 nm (presented below in Figure 5 and Table 1) is close to the reported ablation threshold
for PS at 193 nm.23 The dye not only increases
optical absorption, but also lowers the glass transition temperature
of PS (see Table 1 and Section 3.1 below). The
relevant characteristics of the various films used in experiments
are presented in Table 1a,b together with calculated optical transmission characteristics
of PS films at 193 nm (Table 1c) derived from measurements in ref (22).

2.1 Transformation
from Film to Fibers
The location of holes in a micropillar-suspended
film determines
the pattern of fibers that evolve during the annealing step. The evolution
from holes to fibers is shown in Figure 1b. The fibers form by heating the film to
between T1 and T2 (Table 1).

For the pure PS samples, these empirical temperatures are within
a few degrees of the reported glass transition temperature (Tg). At T1, the patterned
holes begin to expand (by viscoelastic dewetting17,25,26). While the fibers thin to a stable diameter
above T1, scattered remnants of the membrane
may remain at this temperature. However at T2, these last remnants do flow and absorb into the fibers.
As shown in Figure 1b, for a pair of holes patterned on each side of an imaginary line
connecting two pillars, the hole edges expand toward each other to
form a capillary bridge. In Figure 1b, the four holes define two vertical and two horizontal
bridges. The bridges continue to thin, but eventually reach a stable
diameter that persists for a considerable period of time (on the order
of 25 min at 130 °C for pure PS18)
before the fibers show necking or beaded features of Rayleigh plateau
breakup. This stability provides considerable processing latitude
for when the heat can be removed and the fiber is allowed to solidify.

2.2 Need for Prepatterned Holes
Figure 1c,d gives a wider
field of view of the same experiment from Figure 1b. Here, the film is slowly heated (at 1
°C/min) to help observe the process. Holes are first observed
to randomly nucleate at 97 °C in the unpatterned region (outside
the red box in Figure 1c.) At 125 °C (Figure 1d), fibers are fully formed with well-oriented fibers in the
prepatterned region and with randomly oriented networks of fibers
in the unpatterned regions.

Not only does the prepatterned region
have a much lower density of nucleated holes, but the expansion and
transformation into fibers of the prepatterned holes appear negligibly
affected by the smaller holes. The four fibers that form from the
prepatterned holes first reach stable diameters at 125 °C and
remain at the same diameter up to the final temperature of 130 °C.
In the unpatterned area, individual branches of branched fibers begin
to break at 125 °C and most branches are broken at 130 °C,
leaving mostly single unbranched fibers spanning pairs of pillars.
These unbranched fibers are poorly oriented with respect to rows and
columns of the array, and some pairs of pillars are not bridged by
any of the fibers. Occasionally, well-oriented fibers form if a prepatterned
hole is placed on only one side of the line between a pair of pillars
(e.g., in Figure 1d,
the horizontal and vertical fiber in the lower right corner of the
dashed box). In summary, prepatterning of the film followed by annealing
causes fibers both to form at the same time and to persist over the
same period of time. This method permits rather general patterning
of fiber bridges, as is shown next.

2.3 Defining
Arbitrary Patterns of Fibers in x and y
Figure 2a shows a film that has been prepatterned
with the logo “UofL”. A film free border has been patterned
to cleanly separate the patterned from the unpatterned regions. Rather
than patterning circular holes one hole at a time, in this experiment,
entire areas were cleared by continuously translating a focused laser
spot over the film (this sequential exposure process in obviously
slow, and done here for demonstrating STP. However, such exposures
can be done rapidly enabling production rate throughputs, as is considered
in Section 3.1).

The patterned region of the film only begins to show noticeable signs
of thinning into fibers around 120 °C (Figure 2e). The thinning is accelerated at 126 °C,
with the fibers reaching a stable diameter after 6 min (Figure 2f). There are a few small regions
that have not completely thinned, for example, the bottom of the “U”
and the upper right of the “o”. After 20 min at 126
°C (Figure 2g),
these remnants of the film have also evolved into the fully formed
fibers. The fibers that did form at 6 min appear to have hardly changed
in diameter by 20 min. The fibers formed from the patterned film continue
to persist even after an additional 5 min at 129 °C (Figure 2h), after which the
sample was returned to room temperature. This result demonstrates
the long-term persistence of the fibers and the stability of their
resulting diameters.

On the other hand, the unpatterned region
behaves much less controllably,
as can be seen by comparing them with the patterned region of Figure 2f–h. While
many fibers have reached stable diameters, there are still many areas
where the membrane continues to evolve toward fibers even after 5
min at 129 °C. Also, at least one fiber breaks (fiber upper center,
between 6 and 20 min at 126 °C).

2.4 Resulting
Fiber Diameter
The midpoint
diameters of the four well-oriented fibers measured from Figure 1d are d′ = ∼1 μm, and the diameters are nearly constant
in length except where they widen close to their anchor points on
the pillars. Approximating one of these fibers as a cylinder of length l = 20 μm and diameter d gives a
volume 1  

If the volume of the suspended thin
film between four pillars Vs completely
transforms into the idealized fiber geometry, then Vf = Vs/2 (assuming that the
material is uniformly distributed between four fibers) because the
fiber forms from material from two adjacent four-pillar cells. The
volume of the suspended thin film between four pillars can be written
as 2  where D = αl is the diameter of each pillar
and h is
the film thickness. The subtracted term in brackets corresponds to
leaving out the portion of the film resting directly on the pillars.
An additional term corresponding to the volume ablated by the optical
exposure could also be subtracted from eq 2 (and is considered further at the end of
this section). However, this term can be ignored if the exposure is
close to the threshold, where the hole diameter is minimal. Combining eqs 1 and 2 and rearranging for fiber diameter gives 3  

For the experimental parameters for Figure 1 of h = 80 nm and α
= 3/4, the diameter d based on this conservation
of volume argument is 1.63 μm, or the volume of the experimental
fiber is only ∼38% [that is, (d′/d)2] of the volume in the suspended film. The
remainder of the polymer must be wetting the pillar or lost because
of thermal decomposition during the hole patterning step. Because
the holes in this experiment were made by continuous laser heating
(see Table 1), we assume
that the holes formed by nucleation rather than by decomposition,
and we believe that the thinner than modeled fiber diameter is due
to a significant fraction of the film wetting the pillars.

There
are approaches, beyond using more closely spaced pillars,
to make thinner fibers by STP. A thinner film would reduce fiber diameters,
but using a thinner film also increases the probability of random
nucleation of holes. An alternative is to ablate large areas of the
film to reduce material available for formation of fibers. Another
way to reduce the fiber diameter is to prepattern a pair of holes
off center and closer to the midline where a fiber is to be formed.
Similarly, prepatterning that is designed to produce multiple fibers
between pairs of pillars would also result in thinner fibers. An experimental
demonstration of producing thinner fibers by hole placement is described
in the next section.

2.5 Patterning with Increased
Generality
Hole placement strongly affects the suspended
structures that develop
during the annealing step. Figure 3 shows three different patterns formed for three different
hole placement patterns on film 3. A dose (1.3 J/cm2) that
is much larger than the threshold was used to produce holes of 16–18
μm (dose selected based on extrapolation of the trend line in Figure 5a). The darker red
to purple regions are where the film is resting on the pillars. The
image is blue where the film has been removed by the laser pulses.
The dark rings around the holes are thickened areas of the film due
to dewetting of melted portions of the film. The thickened edges are
visible in electron micrographs. In the close up of microscope images,
these ridges do not appear black, suggesting that deposition of carbon
byproducts (i.e., charring) is not significant. Also, PS is known
to cleanly and nearly completely decompose into volatile components,27 though charring does increase at increased heating
rates when oxygen is the reactant.

In Figure 3a (top row), the holes are centered between
each group of four pillars, similar to the patterns in Figure 1, with fibers forming in x and y (Figure 3a, bottom row), as before. However, if the
holes are positioned between two pillars (Figure 3b, top row), lattice type structures form,
which have the appearance of fused tapered fiber optic couplers (Figure 3b, bottom row).

Figure 3c (top row)
shows the boundary between the patterns of holes in Figure 3a,b. Annealing then produces
a different pattern at the boundary in the y direction
(Figure 3c, bottom
row). At first glance, the new structure appears to be a combination
of a fiber and a lattice structure. However, the fiber is not identical
to the other fibers to the left. Instead, it has a smaller diameter.
It is apparent that the holes, as they expanded, isolated a narrow
thread of the polymer film, which, because of its smaller area and
volume than available when the holes are centered holes (as in Figure 3a), produces a thinner
fiber.

The result in Figure 3c shows that patterning additional holes could be used
to define
multiple channels that transform during annealing into multiple parallel
fibers between two pillars, or instead, could form bifurcated and
more highly branched fibers originating from one pillar and terminating
on one or more pillars. For purposes of design, computational modeling
of viscoelastic fluid flow could be used to both identify new types
of suspended structures, and to more precisely predict the resulting
geometries. Such models also can be used in the development of design
rules that compensate for “proximity effects,” that
is, possible modifications in the formation of one structure by nearby
structures.

Single fibers also can be formed in diagonal directions,
as shown
in Figure 4. Rather
than using well-defined holes, film 5 is patterned so as to leave
strips connecting pairs of pillars (Figure 4, upper row). The strips have quite jagged
edges because in these experiments (1), the fluence is set high to
remove a large area with each pulse, (2) in order to minimize the
number of exposures, the laser spot is stepped so as to minimize overlap
with the previous exposures, and (3) the stage position is manually
adjusted while viewing the sample through a microscope. Despite the
rough edges, after annealing, the fibers (Figure 4, bottom row) are much smoother than the
original strips, which is a desirable feature of STP. However, if
projection printing is used to prepattern the film, as proposed herein,
then an entire film can be patterned in a single parallel exposure,
and the resulting patterns can have minimal edge roughness. Furthermore,
the optical resolution of the image projected on the film does not
necessarily need to be at the maximum printer resolution because the
annealing process converts thicker structures (e.g., strips of film)
into thinner fibers.

2.6 Measured Exposure Thresholds
for Forming Holes
in the Films
In comparing our results with previous reports
on laser etching and thermal decomposition of polymers,23,32,33,34 it should be noted that these were all performed on bulk samples,
and therefore the hole formation threshold and etching threshold are
not precisely comparable. Nonetheless, we do find that the hole formation
is of the same order of magnitude as the reported ablation thresholds.

Figure 5 presents
hole diameter as a function of fluence for films 1–3 in Table 1. The films were exposed
to single (Figure 5a) and multiple (Figure 5b) 25–30 ns pulses (where pulse width varies with the
pulse energy) from a 532 nm Q-switched laser (Spectra-Physics Nd:YAG
Explorer One). The laser is focused onto a film to a spot with waist
size wo = 1.65 μm (measured by video
microscopy and fit to a Gaussian profile). Here, we report fluence,
the average intensity across the spot, as 4  where Ep is the
energy of a single pulse. For reference, note that fluence at the
peak of a Gaussian profile is 2F.

Figure 5a shows
hole diameter as a function of laser dose. It is used to determine
the threshold doses reported in Table 1. Each curve has a low slope and a high slope region.
The lower slope is related to the interaction of the film with the
exponential tails of the Gaussian beam. A flat-top beam would be expected
to result in a zero or near zero slope. The higher slope region could
be extrapolated to zero hole diameter, though we report the threshold
value more conservatively as the lowest dose for which a hole was
observed in a light microscope. Also, while not investigated, it is
worth noting that exposure at somewhat lower levels could still possibly
lead to the controllable formation of holes at the start of the thermal
annealing step.

The exposure threshold depends on film thickness
and amount of
SR7B. The values for film 1 (starting solution 0.25 wt % PS) are close
to the previous threshold values of 10 mJ/cm2 for etching
of pure PS with 193 nm nanosecond laser pulses.23 However, direct comparison between these previous results
and those reported here are not straightforward, given that in the
previous experiments, a much shorter wavelength was used, and the
threshold was based on seeing a detectable change in the thickness
(of a few nanometers) of bulk PS. Furthermore, because our films have
a significant fraction of SR7B, the exposure threshold is lower (see Table 1), which correlates
with the lowering of the empirically determined temperatures T1 (at which the prepatterned hole begins to
expand) and T2 (where the last remnant
of membrane disappears).

Figure 5b reports
thresholds for exposure with various numbers of laser pulses. Each
threshold is derived from a plot of the same form as Figure 5a. The maximum number of pules
in Figure 5b is equivalent
to a one-half second exposure (corresponding to a throughput of around
60 wph for an NXT stepper, as discussed in Section 3.1). The threshold decreases with the increasing
number of pulses to as low as 3.3 mJ/cm2 (85 nm thick film
1). Film 5 (made with a lower molecular weight PS) was characterized
at two repetition rates. For a 0.5 s exposure at each rate, the threshold
is substantially lower for the 55 kHz rate than for the 6 kHz rate.
The lower threshold is likely due to there being less time to cool
between each pulse for the higher rate than for the lower rate. However,
the threshold is lowered only by around 10% at the higher rate when
comparing the thresholds for the same number of pulses.

The
results in Table 1 give
some insight into ways to vary the exposure threshold, and
interrelationships between the threshold and other relevant properties
of the film. For films 1–4, the threshold is lower for films
that are thinner. Also, the empirical temperatures T1 and T2 decrease for thinner
films. The lower temperatures are due to the increased fraction of
SR7B in the thinner films (which have a higher ratio of dye to polymer
in the starting solution). While ultrathin films are known to have
a lower glass transition temperature than bulk polymers,28 the transition temperatures are much lower than
the transition temperatures for pure PS films (for the undyed, pure
PS films 1–3, listed in parentheses, there is no more than
a 10 °C lowering of the empirical temperatures for these 20–55
nm thick films). Instead, the lowering of these temperatures is due
to the SR7B dye acting basically as a plasticizer. One film (film
5) was made with lower molecular weight PS. Its thickness (100 nm)
and optical absorption are nearly the same as film 2 (105 nm). However,
the empirical annealing temperatures are 20–25 °C lower
than those for film 2.

3 Conclusions and Discussion
The abovementioned experimental results demonstrate that arbitrary
general patterns of high aspect ratio suspended polymer structures
can be formed by first photopatterning a suspended polymer film with
holes, and then, thermally annealing the patterned film. This method
avoids the traditional approach of producing air bridges by removal
of an underlying support layer, which has advantages of supporting
very flexible, soft, and delicate (even biological) materials that
have high likelihood of being damaged by capillary collapse or by
harsh solvents that are used for traditional methods of release. The
annealing step also tends to smooth out rough features and produces
patterns that can be of much higher spatial resolution than the photomask
pattern.

Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the method
supports mass
production of a layer of suspended polymer structures, given that
pulsed laser illumination of sufficient fluence (which are available,
though not integrated into current production steppers) is used. STP
could be custom-integrated into roll-to-roll manufacturing systems
or developed for future wafer steppers.

However, for published
PS etching properties or the dyed PS films
considered in this study, the hole formation threshold exceeds the
fluence available from 193 nm production rate steppers, which means
that STP does not yet work at economically feasible mass production
rates.

3.1 Discussion: Proposed Approaches for Reducing
the Exposure Threshold
A stepper throughput of 50 wafers
per h (wph), equivalent to 1.33 devices per s (see notes in Table 2), is generally considered the minimum rate for an economically
feasible manufacturing process. At the minimum feasible throughput
rate, there is up to 190 and 618 ms per exposure for the PAS and NXT
steppers (after mechanical stepping time, from Table 2, has been subtracted from the period between
pulses.). Therefore, doses up to 0.2 J/cm2 for the PAS
and 4 J/cm2 for the NXT steppers would be available for
exposure of a single device (though using the maximum available dose
could produce undesirable heating of the underlying substrate).

Considering
in more detail Lazare and Granier’s report of
single pulse fluence for PS,23 which reports
an etching threshold of 10 mJ/cm2, the experimental curve
of etch depth d as a function of fluence F is well fit (between 10 and 100 mJ/cm2) as 5  where F is in units of mJ/cm2 and d is in units of nanometers. Thus, to
etch or ablate a hole in, for example, a 55 nm film at 27.5 mJ/cm2 requires 5 pulses or 138 mJ/cm2 total dose. Closer
to threshold at 15.3 mJ/cm2, it requires 12 pulses and
the total dose increases to 183 mJ/cm2. The total dose
only increases further as F approaches the threshold.
Therefore, direct etching of PS, in practice, requires higher fluence
per pulse than the etching threshold. Brygo et al. reported, for an
unnamed paint, that the measured threshold was lowered by a factor
8.5× by increasing the number of pulses from 8 to 275 pulses.29 For comparison, in our exposure experiments
with repetitive pulses of the dyed PS film (Table 2), the multiple pulse threshold was 3.2 to
4.3× lower than the single pulse threshold for films 1–3.
This still exceeds the single pulse fluence from the production steppers
in Table 1, and the
total dose for the multiple pulses was 10–46 J/cm2. By any measure, a considerable reduction in threshold is required
to make STP compatible with production rate steppers.

Ways to
lower the threshold are to use different or modified materials
that decompose at lower temperatures or to dissolve in the film or
surround the film with a vapor that becomes locally reactive underneath
the laser. One way to lower the decomposition temperature has already
been demonstrated in our experiments. This is mixing the polymer with
a second material that lowers the hole formation exposure threshold,
as well as hole expansion temperature T1 in Table 1 (and closely
related Tg). While the added material
SR7B was intended as a dye, it also appears to act as a plasticizer
that lowers the hole formation temperature. These results with doped
PS suggest a possible route to lowering the threshold for 193 nm exposures.

Specifically, PS could be doped with low molecular weight PS, oligomeric
PS, or even styrene monomers. There is already some evidence in Table 1 of lower molecular
weight PS affecting the empirical temperature and threshold dose.
Compare the results for film 2 and film 5. The thickness and absorbance
of the two films is essentially identical. However, film 5, which
is made with the lower molecular weight PS, has considerably lower
empirical temperatures and threshold dose. Mixing even lower molecular
weight PS with high molecular weight PS could produce a film with
an even lower exposure threshold.

To the extent that styrene
or similar aromatics that absorb strongly
at 193 nm can be mixed with PS, it may be possible to increase the
concentration of these chromophores, thereby increasing absorbance
and decreasing the optical penetration depth. In so doing, the energy
density would be further increased, reducing the exposure threshold.
In fact, comparing the calculated UV absorbance to the dyed films
from Table 1, the penetration
depth can be seen to be considerably shorter at UV.

As mentioned
above, ablation and hole formation thresholds are
not identical, and other factors may favor a lower hole formation
threshold. Some possibilities already mentioned above are nanocracks
produced by thermal shock, and that holes may spontaneously form with
only partial etching through the film. In addition to these factors,
one can consider that a film has increased surface area, increased
permeability to admitting and releasing of gas species, and increased
thermal confinement over bulk samples. Finally, while it was noted
that spontaneous hole formation of a melted thin film is of the order
of 1 min, the formation time is dramatically reduced with lower molecular
weight.30 Given that photolithographic
patterning is based on breaking down the molecular weight of the polymeric
resist, together with partial etching and thinning of the film, suggests
that hole nucleation could also occur at a lower single pulse threshold,
especially when there are multiple pulses that exceed the photolithographic
exposure dose (e.g., those typical numbers of 20–30 mJ/cm2 that are used in developing the stepper specifications in Table 2 notes f, g.)

3.2 Summary of Findings
While the method
of STP is already suitable for custom fabrication and prototyping
of devices that include a flexible MEMS layer, the factors discussed
above suggest promising materials and process modifications that could
enable hole exposure thresholds low enough to perform STP with current
production steppers at economically feasible manufacturing rates.
It is also worth noting that this method of producing suspended fiber
structures is amenable to the various material modifications and device
applications2,13−15 mentioned in
the Introduction section that have been demonstrated
or proposed for the previous methods of producing suspended fibers.1−9

4 Materials and Methods
Figure 1a summarizes
the steps used to fabricate suspended structures. The steps are essentially
identical to those reported in earlier studies on the dynamic breakup
of thin films into fibers,16−18 but with the addition of a step
in which holes are optically patterned (Figure 1a, second panel from left). The wafer throughput
estimates presented herein also assume a laser is used, but rather
than being focused to a single spot, as done in experiments, a photomask
would be illuminated by a laser that is imaged onto the membrane.
In the experiments, a 532 nm laser is used, while for the throughput
estimates, a 193 nm wavelength pulsed excimer laser, as is used in
current wafer steppers, is assumed.

4.1 Film
Preparation
Films 1–6
are cast from starting solutions (listed in Table 1) of atactic (non-crystallizable) PS (Mn = 400 kDa, Mw/Mn = 1.06, Pressure Chemical Company), dissolved
at from 0.25 to 1.25 wt % in toluene, together with 1.25 wt % Sudan
Red 7B (SR7B, Sigma-Aldrich). Undissolved SR7B is removed by filtering
the solution through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter (VWR). Films are
coated onto a polished silicon wafer that has been cleaned by sonication
in acetone for 5 min, toluene for 5 min, and then exposed in air to
UV-generated ozone for 30 min. Immediately after ozone treatment,
the wafer is dipped in deionized water for 1 min and air-dried, which
facilitates the separation of the polymer film from Si in the following
step.

The wafers were coated either by the doctor blade method
with a blade acceleration of 6 mm/s2 to produce gradient
thickness film16,31 or by spin-coating at 8000 rpm
to form a constant thickness film. The resulting thicknesses (Table 1) are measured by
atomic force microscopy (Asylum MFP-3D) for all films, except for
the gradient thickness film (film 6) which was measured optically
(using a Filmetrics F20 thickness monitor). Table 1 also shows that the films are much thinner
with the dye omitted. The experiments that were performed with the
80 nm thick regions of the gradient films are shown in Figures 1 and 2, and the experiments with the spun on films are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

The films are detached from the silicon substrate
by immersing
them in water. The film floats to the surface of the water and then
is brought in contacted from below with a submerged micropillar array.
A second identically prepared film is mounted onto a microscope slide
for optical absorption measurements in a spectrometer (2000 USB, Ocean
Optics). Some pillar arrays were cast from SU8 photoresist (MicroChem
Corporation) that are dyed red to help distinguish them in microscope
images from the polymer film and fibers. Other micropillar arrays
were fabricated by patterned etching of silicon. The suspended films
are dried under vacuum (∼20 Torr) for 12–24 h at 50–55
°C (i.e., below the ∼100 °C glass transition temperature
of PS), primarily to remove any water trapped between the film and
the tips of the micropillars (residual toluene also would be removed
by vacuum baking, but we observed for films coated on silicon wafers
that the film thicknesses are identical after either 2 h of drying
in air or after an additional day of vacuum baking). In passing, we
note that the temperature and time of aging of PS films does play
a role in hole nucleation and film thickness and therefore should
be considered in the use of STP. Reiter et al. found that the spontaneous
hole nucleation rates at temperatures close to Tg decreased with increased aging times at 50 °C for 40
nm thick 4.8 MDa PS films.25 Aging above Tg also releases residual stress of spun on films
from solvated polymers, which results in thickening of the films32 and spontaneous formation of holes.25,30

The optical absorption (A = 1 – T – R) of the (duplicate glass-mounted)
films at 532 nm is determined by spectrometer measurements of T and R, which are the relative amounts
of transmitted and reflected energy with respect to the incident energy. Table 1 reports A and T. The dyed films absorb somewhat less energy
at 532 nm than suspended films of pure PS at 193 nm (as calculated
from the Fresnel equations24 at normal
incidence). Also, the films at UV hardly absorb any additional energy
at depths greater than about 50 nm.

4.2 Film
Prepatterning
Initially, a continuous
wave laser was used to prepattern the films. The film was heated to
75 °C to reduce the heat required from the laser. For the CW
laser focused to around 6.5 μm spot radius on an 80 nm film,
the preferred exposure was 122 mW for 0.025 s (or 3.5 mJ or, using eq 4, ∼2.6 kJ/cm2). This is an unrealistically large fluence for commercial
steppers. The reason for such a high dose is thermal diffusion that,
over the relatively long exposure time, spreads the heat out and creates
a surface area for cooling that is much larger than the area that
is irradiated by the laser.

Originally, we had assumed that
heating thin films to melting was sufficient to nucleate holes, however,
a review of the literature shows that for films of around 20 nm, nucleation
is spontaneous, while for films of 60–100 nm, hole nucleation
events can take around 1 min or longer.30,33 This amount
of time is too long for practical/economical use in commercial wafer
steppers. As a result, in the later studies, we used nanosecond laser
pulses (and with the film at room temperature). Holes in thin films
can then be produced by a combination of thermal decomposition and
photodissociation, with photodissociation becoming more significant
at 193 nm than at 532 nm.34,35 Laser-induced shock
waves, vaporization, and cavitation also can produce holes in thin
films, though they are not the dominant contribution in polymer etching
for pulse durations greater than 1 ns. Nonetheless, while not investigated
here, if nanoscale defects are produced below the hole formation threshold
by these thermal effects, these defects may be sufficient to produce
expanding holes at the start of thermal anneal.

Repetitive pulses
have been observed to reduce the energy threshold
(per pulse) over single pulse exposures.29 With a fast enough repetition rate, the polymer does not completely
cool between pulses, but instead gradually heats with each pulse.29,36 The longer heating period provides adequate time for the polymer
to thermally decompose.36 Extrapolating
from the kinetic models of thermal decomposition of PS measured at
seconds to minutes timescales27 shows that
hundreds of degrees higher decomposition temperatures (assuming that
the same oxygen reaction pathway controls decomposition at these elevated
temperatures) are required for the nanosecond and microsecond time
scales in refs (29) and (36).

An
unresolved issue in the preparation of PS thin film is the differences
found between the spun on and doctor blade-prepared films. The doctor
blade-coated sample (film 6) has somewhat higher empirical temperatures,
and the 120 nm thick portion of the gradient thickness film absorbs
considerably less light than film 3 (which has nearly the same thickness,
125 nm, and identical starting solution as film 6.)
