Grafting
of guar gum (GG) and in situ strategic attachment of acrylamidosodiumpropanoate
(ASP) via solution polymerization of acrylamide (AM) and sodium acrylate
(SA) resulted in the synthesis of a sustainable GG-g-(AM-co-SA-co-ASP)/GGAMSAASP interpenetrating
polymer network (IPN)-based smart superadsorbent with excellent physicochemical
properties and reusability, through systematic optimization by response
surface methodology (RSM) for removal of methyl violet (MV) and/or
Hg(II). The relative effects of SA/AM ratios, in situ allocation of
ASP, grafting of GG into the AMSAASP terpolymer, ligand-selective
superadsorption mechanism, and relative microstructural changes in
individually/synergistically-adsorbed MV–/Hg(II)–/Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs
were determined by extensive analyses using Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis), and O 1s-/N 1s-/C 1s-/Hg 4f7/2,5/2-X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopies, thermogravimetric analysis, differential
scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron
microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy and were supported
by % gel content, pHPZC, and % graft ratio. The ionic/covalent-bonding,
monodentate, bidentate bridging, and bidentate chelating coordination
between GGAMSAASPs and Hg(II), and MV+–Hg(II) bonding
were rationalized by FTIR, UV–vis, fitment of kinetics data
to the pseudo-second-order model, and thermodynamic parameters. The
maximum adsorption capacities of 49.12 and 53.28 mg g–1 were determined for Hg(II) and MV, respectively, under optimized
conditions.

Introduction
Hydrogels are porous
polymeric networks produced by the cross-linking
of synthetic and/or natural polymers (NPs) and can become many times
voluminous by absorbing water during reversible swelling.1 The relative availability of various hydrophilic/hydrophobic
functional groups, originated via variation in synthesis parameters,
such as temperature, initial pH (pHi) of solution, mole
ratios of monomers, wt % of NP, cross-linker, and initiator, significantly
affects the swelling properties of interpenetrating polymer network
(IPN) hydrogels. In fact, grafting of NPs into the network of a homo/co/terpolymer,
followed by cross-linking to the either polymer(s) to produce semi/full-IPN,
can provide the optimum balance between mechanical strength and biodegradability.2,3 Synthetic/semisynthetic hydrogels are mostly used in tissues, chromatography,
pharmaceutical/cosmetic industries,4 and
sustained drug delivery. Hydrogels are used in artificial cornea implants5 and as biosensors for hepatitis B antigen,6 glucose,7 hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c),8 and bile acids.9

Nowadays, hazardous dyes/metal ions [M(II/III/VI)]
of waste effluents
cause serious threat to all living organisms via severe water pollution.10 The most important anthropogenic sources of
Hg evolution in aquatic systems involve atmospheric deposition, erosion,
urban discharges, agricultural materials, mining, combustion, industrial
discharges, and compact fluorescent lamps.11−13 Mercury is
utilized in chlor-alkali and vinyl chloride monomer production, artisanal
small scale gold mining, gold recovery from electronic waste, pesticides,
and many other industrial applications. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency has suggested 0.002 mg L–1 and
10 μg L–1 discharge to be the maximum allowable
limit for Hg(II) in drinking and waste water, respectively. Therefore,
it is imperative to eliminate even trace amounts of such a serious
pollutant before discharging effluents into the environment, for human
safety and environmental protection. Hg inflicts severe toxicity due
to the nonbiodegradability and recirculating property in the environment.14,15 In addition, Hg causes neurologic malfunction, gastrointestinal
disorder, and renal problems.14 Methylmercury,
the most toxic form of Hg, is highly detrimental for human embryo
even when present in very small amounts.16

Meanwhile, more than 10 000 different types of synthetic
aromatic dyes are used as coloring agents in plastic, pharmaceutical,
textile, printing, paper, food, and other chemical industries.17 Industrial wastes containing of about 15 wt
% nonbiodegradable dyes and pigments eventually impart severe carcinogenic
effects. The modern techniques used for eliminating industrial waste
effluents are reverse osmosis, reduction, coagulation,18 solvent extraction, ion exchange,18 chemical precipitation, membrane-based separation,19−21 and adsorption.22,23 Of these, adsorption is preferred
because of the versatility, cost effectivity, simplicity of design,
accuracy, selectivity, and high degree of efficiency.13 Indeed, the suitability of the triphenylmethane dyes for
M(II) detection24 has eventually encouraged
the simultaneous removal of Hg(II) and methyl violet (MV).

Guar
gum (GG), a nonionic hydrophilic galactomannan polysaccharide
seed gum, contains linear chains of a (1–4)-linked β-d-mannopyranose backbone with branch points from their 6-positions
linked to β-d-galactose (i.e., 1–6-linked β-d-galactopyranose) in a 1:2 ratio.25 This O–H rich galactomannan forms H bonds, imparting significant
viscosity. Moreover, GG finds high-performance applications in a large
number of industries because of solubility in cold water, gelling
properties, pH stability from 4.00 to 10.50, film-forming ability,
biodegradability, nontoxicity, low cost, and renewability. However,
GG-based IPNs not only bring the favorable properties by introducing
newer functional groups but also impart the inherent diversified advantages
of GG. Indeed, chemical modification of GG removes their intrinsic
deficiencies, which may restrict their overall utilization in diversified
field of applications. In this context, the graft copolymers of GG,
such as GG-g-poly(ethylacrylate),26 GG-g-poly(acrylic acid) (AA),27 GG-g-poly(acrylamide) (AM),28 and GG-multiwalled carbon nanotubes nanocomposite
hydrogels,29 have effectively been used
for adsorptive removals of various aqueous waste contaminants. Again,
graft copolymers, such as potato starch-g-poly(AM-co-AA-co-bicarboxylic itaconic acid),30 xanthan gum-g-poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate-co-AA),31 quaternary ammonium
chitosan-g-poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide),32 and GG-g-poly(AM-co-aniline),33 have been tested for removal
of dyes and M(II/III/VI) such as Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), Fe(II),
Cr(VI), and Hg(II). In this context, incorporation of an acrylamido
functionality in the polymer matrix was carried out using several
acrylamide derivatives, such as 2-acrylamido glycolic acid,34 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid,35 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid,36 and 3-acrylamido phenylboronic acid,37 as external monomers. In this context, we carried
out in situ incorporation of acrylamidosodiumpropanoate (ASP) within
the network of GG-grafted AMSAASP (i.e., GGAMSAASP) via solution polymerization
of sodium acrylate (SA) and AM, which is yet to be reported. Meanwhile,
several homo/copolymers, IPNs, and composite hydrogels have been reported
for removal of dyes and M(II) individually.

The synthesis of
tailor-made sustainable GGAMSAASP, an NP-grafted
terpolymer, without ex situ incorporation of ASP, the introduction
of new possible pathway for superadsorbent synthesis, adjunct allocation
of ASP, extensive microstructural analyses of GGAMSAASP14/18, MV–GGAMSAASP14/18,
Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14/18, and Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP14/18,
effect of variation in the composition of GGAMSAASPs and ligand-selective
MV, and/or Hg(II) superadsorption mechanism influencing relative distribution
of Hg(II) at the surface/bulk have extensively been studied and reported
for the first time.

Experimental Section
Materials
AA,
AM, GG, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide
(MBA), potassium persulfate (PPS),
sodium bisulfite (SBS), MV, and HgCl2 of analytical grades
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further modification.

Synthesis of Hydrogels
GGAMSAASP was synthesized through
free radical solution polymerization via grafting of GG to the terpolymer
network and in situ adjunct allocation of ASP, SA, and AM, employing
PPS and SBS as the redox initiator system and MBA as the cross-linker
in a N2 atmosphere. The exact composition of ingredients
and the reaction temperature were preoptimized by response surface
methodology (RSM) via ensuring maximum swelling of the synthesized
hydrogels, which were prepared by successive incorporation of varied
dosages of AM and MBA at different pHi values. Finally,
two different GGAMSAASPs, one possessing the optimum conditions (GGAMSAASP18,
AM/SA = 1:8) and the other containing a different AM/SA ratio (GGAMSAASP14,
AM/SA = 1:4), were chosen for the ligand-selective adsorption study.
The motive for synthesizing different GGAMSAASPs of varying compositions
was to investigate the relative distribution and population of Hg(II)
and MV, both on the surface and in the bulk of the adsorbents. Initially,
two uniform suspensions, each containing 0.5 g of GG powder, were
prepared in 42.9/46.2 mL of H2O at 313 K using an ultrasonicator
to ensure complete dissolution of GG without formation of clumps.
Then, in a three-neck reactor, the as-obtained GG suspension was taken,
followed by the dropwise addition of SA (0.26/0.21 mol prepared in
34.60/27.30 mL of water at the rate of 30 drops min–1) at pHi = 5.5 and addition of AM (0.02/0.07 mol, prepared
in 8.00/12.00 mL of water) with constant stirring at 300 rpm. Then,
the MBA solution (0.26 mmol prepared in 4.5 mL of water) was added
at a constant temperature (i.e., 295 K), and the resultant solution
was allowed to homogenize under a N2 atmosphere for 8 h.
Thereafter, polymerization was initiated via gradual addition of PPS
and SBS as redox initiators, prepared in 10 mL of water by dissolving
0.23 and 0.60 mmol, respectively. The prepared GGAMSAASPs were allowed
to swell in 1:3 methanol/water solution (v/v) and washed several times
for the complete removal of unreacted monomers and water-soluble oligomers.
Finally, GGAMSAASPs were air-dried for 3 days, followed by drying
under a vacuum oven at 323 K.

Characterization
Unadsorbed and/or adsorbed GGAMSAASPs
were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) through a
Spectrum-2 spectrometer, Singapore, proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) using a Bruker AVANCE Digital 300 MHz spectrometer
in CDCl3 solvent with tetramethylsilane as an internal
reference, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) via ESCA+, Omicron
NanoTechnology, Oxford Instruments Germany, thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) using a Pyris6 TGA analyzer, The Netherlands within 30–700
°C, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) via a Pyris6 DSC
calorimeter, The Netherlands within 30–442 °C, X-ray diffraction
(XRD) by an X’Pert PRO, PANalytical B.V., The Netherlands,
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDX) using a ZEISS EVO-MA 10 spectrometer. GGAMSAASP
was also characterized by the % graft ratio, % gel content, pH at
point of zero charge (i.e., pHPZC), and equilibrium swelling
ratio (ESR) at different pHi values. RSM and all graphics
based analyses were carried out using Design-Expert 7.0.0 and Origin
9.0 software.

Experimental Design for RSM-Optimized Synthesis
of GGAMSAASP18
Hydrogels exhibit variable swelling by the
prevalence of diversified
hydrophilic functional groups. In fact, the relative population of
such groups predominantly depends on the change in the amounts of
synthetic parameters, such as AM (wt %, A), initiator
(wt %, B), GG (wt %, C), cross-linker
(wt %, D), and pHi (−, E). Because the hydrogel possessing the maximum ESR is anticipated
to impart the highest adsorption capacity (AC) toward removals of
dyes/M(II), identification of the optimum conditions for synthesizing
such a hydrogel is essential. In fact, synergistic effects along with
individual effects of such process variables may play a pivotal role
in the variation of ESR of hydrogels, and hence, optimization of the
process variables is crucial. However, investigation of such individual
and/or synergistic effects through one factor at a time (OFAT) approach
is very tedious and does not include the two factor interaction(s),
that is, 2FI(s), between variables. Therefore, the design of experiments
method was used, which included individual and/or synergistic effects
and reduced the overall cost of research via substantial reduction
in the total number of experiments. In this context, RSM, a frequently
used statistical method, was utilized because it involves both OFAT
and 2FI approaches. However, the use of a full factorial RSM design
is highly strenuous because this consists of total 25 =
32 experimental runs. Therefore, fractional factorial design (resolution-IV),
an intelligent RSM design, was adopted to isolate distinct variables
incorporating the maximum effect on ESR, via analyzing Pareto chart
and half-normality plots, for significant reduction in the experimental
runs. Finally, the full factorial design was carried out by using
the as-obtained most significant process variables through the central
composite design (CCD) analysis.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
FTIR
Several characteristic peaks of GG and AMSAASPs
were noted to disappear in the FTIR spectra of GGAMSAASPs, together
with notable alterations in several symbolic peaks of AMSAASPs (Figure 1a, S1), which indicated the intimate interactions between GG
and AMSAASPs. For instance, the symbolic GG peak at 870 cm–1, designated to C–C/C–O vibrations coupled with anomeric
C–H of β-conformers, disappeared in both the GGAMSAASPs.38 Interestingly, besides the orthodox (1–4)/(1–6)
glycosidic linkages, the formation of −CH2–O–CH2– type ether linkage within GGAMSAASPs was realized
from the arrival of a new peak at 1122 cm–1, which
was neither present in GG nor in AMSAASPs, confirming the grafting
of GG within AMSAASPs via interactions between unsaturated SA/AM moieties
and −CH2–O• generated from
the primary alcohol of GG (Scheme 1).39 In fact, such conversion
of −CH2OH into −CH2–O• was also substantiated by the complete loss of the
symbolic −CH2OH peak of GG at 1076 cm–1 in both the GGAMSAASPs, together with appearance of a new C–O–C def. peak of aliphatic ether at 424/426 cm–1.40 In fact, grafting-driven new ether
linkage formation led to considerable alterations in various −CH2– vibrations, including the disappearance of the −CH2– twisting peak at 1024 cm–1 in GGAMSAASPs. Furthermore, the intimate phase mixing within GGAMSAASPs
resulted in significant changes in the H-bonding environment, as apprehended
from the arrival of new H-bonded O–H str.
peaks in the range of 3600–3650 cm–1 for
GGAMSAASPs. Moreover, several changes in the H-bonding environment
were also realized from the arrival of new peaks at 2352, 2346, and
2331 cm–1 in GGAMSAASP18,2 along with the marginal shifting of the broad peak from 3433/3435
cm–1 of AMSAASP18/14 to 3434 cm–1 in both GGAMSAASPs (Figure 1a). Moreover, in-plane vibrations of both C–C=O def. and N–C=O in primary amides were influenced
by the grafting-related alterations in the surrounding H-bonding environment.
For instance, the C–C=O def. peak at
481 cm–1 of AMSAASPs disappeared completely in both
the GGAMSAASPs. Moreover, significant alterations in the H-bonding
environment around AMSAASP moieties within GGAMSAASPs and the associated
intermingling removed several characteristic bending peaks at 670,
657, 645, and 632 cm–1 of N–C=O in
secondary amides, together with the formation of new N–C=O
peaks at 674/672 and 651/648 cm–1 for GGAMSAASP18/14
(Figure 1a). Furthermore,
changes in the vibrations of both C–C=O and N–C=O
moieties should closely be associated with the notable decrease in
C–N str. and bending vibrations
of the amide III band from 1323 cm–1 for AMSAASP
to 1319 cm–1 in GGAMSAASP14, whereas the same band
remained unchanged at 1318 cm–1 in GGAMSAASP18,
owing to the relatively fewer population of C–N bonds in GGAMSAASP18.41 Indeed, several symbolic peaks, corresponding
to amide III, C–C=O, and N–C=O of amides,
indicated the transformation of primary into secondary amides via
addition reaction between −CO–NH• and
unsaturated chains to produce −CO–NH–CH2– segment, which eventually altered the prevalent −CH2– and C–N peaks, especially in GGAMSAASP14.
Notably, the simultaneous existence of both −COOH and −COO– in GGAMSAASP18 was detected from the prevalent peaks
corresponding to C=O str. of −COOH
at 1742, 1738, 1718, and 1705 cm–1 along with νs(−COO–) and νas(−COO–) at 1405 and 1560 cm–1, respectively.42 Indeed, the peaks at 1705 and 1742 cm–1 were attributed to C=O str. of cyclic H-bonded
−COOH in dimeric form and free −COOH of GGAMSAASP18,
respectively.43 Though both −COOH
and −COO– were simultaneously present in
GGAMSAASP18, relatively fewer number of C=O str. peaks within 1700–1750 cm–1 and the complete
disappearance of the peak at 1705 cm–1 in GGAMSAASP14
could be related to the complete absence of the cyclic H-bonded −COOH
dimer because of the lowering of available −COOH in GGAMSAASP14.
Again, the participation of −COO– in ionic
bonding was ascertained from Δν, between νas(−COO–) and νs(−COO–), of 155/157 cm–1 for GGAMSAASP18/14,
which was well within the range of ionic interaction (i.e., 136–164
cm–1).44

AMSAASP18/14, and GG and (b) Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18/14,
Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18/14, and MV–GGAMSAASP18/14.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of GGAMSAASPs
Notably, Hg(II) demonstrated
preferential attachment with the amide
over −COO–. Indeed, the intimate association
between Hg(II) and amides could be anticipated by the formation of
the Hg–N covalent bond, related to the newly appeared characteristic
peaks at 507/511 cm–1 in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18/14.
In this context, the complete disappearance of peaks at 671 and 648
cm–1, designated to N–C=O in-plane
bending of α-branched aliphatic secondary amides, could be related
to the formation of the covalent bond between Hg(II) and amides. In
this context, Hoang et al. established the formation of the N–Hg–N
bond between thymine bases of DNA via releasing two imino protons
into the solution.45 As suggested by the
earlier works,46 possible entrapment of
Hg(II) within GGAMSAASPs might produce numerous >N–Hg–N<
cross-links to impart increased steric hindrance, especially at the
outer region of GGAMSAASP18, resulting in the substantial restrictive
penetration and diffusion of Hg(II) from the densely cross-linked
outer region to the bulk of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18. Furthermore,
a relatively higher proportion of −COO– in
GGAMSAASP18 should impart more hydrophilic character in GGAMSAASP18
over GGAMSAASP14. At the time of Hg(II) adsorption from the aqueous
phase, more hydrophilic −COO– should preferentially
be located on the hydrogel surface, more so in GGAMSAASP18. Thus,
a relatively increased number of −COO–, especially
on the GGAMSAASP18 surface, could interact with the incoming Hg(II)
and thus resist the penetration into the bulk of the network. Moreover,
the preferential binding of Hg(II) on the GGAMSAASP18 surface increased
the hydrophobic character of the outer surface and thus resulted in
the prevalence of some free −NH2 in the interior
region. In fact, the presence of unreacted −NH2 could
be detected in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18 from the appearance of a
significantly intense peak at 1614 cm–1 (Figure 1b, S1), ascribed mainly to amide II, as a result of a typical
bending vibration of free −NH2 along with νas(−COO–). In this regard, the characteristic
peak for −NH2 of pure poly(AM) appears at 1613 cm–1.47 However, a broad peak
of relatively lower intensity at 1617 cm–1 was observed
in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14, which suggested relative scarcity of
free −NH2 in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14 as compared
to that in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18. Nevertheless, small peaks at
667/1570 and 666/1570 cm–1 were attributed to −NH2def. and sciss., respectively,
for free −NH2 that appeared in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs
(Figure 1b).40,48 Moreover, both the amide I bands of primary and aliphatic secondary
amides within 1650–1670 and 1650–1630 cm–1, respectively, were not found in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18. On the
contrary, the presence of both of these amide peaks in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14
indicated the lesser interaction of >C=O of amides with
Hg(II).
As the population of free −NH2 was relatively higher
in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14, such −NH2 might be
attacked by Hg(II) to produce >N–Hg–N< cross-links
and −Hg–NH– moieties more frequently in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14
than in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18. Thus, in addition to the significantly
higher proportion of −OH, relatively greater availability of
free −NH2 in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18 ensured the
prevalence of higher number of mutual weaker H-bonds among −NH2 and −OH to produce a broad and relatively intense
peak at 3522 cm–1. Such an increase in the mutual
H-bonding restricted the probability of strong H-bonding among individual
O–H, as envisaged from the small peaks of lower intensities
at 2352 and 2343 cm–1 in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18
than that of the relatively intense peaks of GGAMSAASP18. Accordingly,
a broad but comparatively less intense peak at an appreciably lower
wave number of 3434 cm–1 indicated lesser possibility
of mutual −NH2/O–H H-bonding within Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14.
In fact, the lowering in such mutual H-bonding could encourage the
formation of stronger H-bonds among O–H in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14,
which is also reflected from the arrival of small intense peaks at
2352 and 2341 cm–1 (Figure 1b). However, in the presence of adsorbed
Hg(II), the appreciable change in mutual H-bonding in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18
could be in consequence to the replacement of Na+ by Hg(II)
during adsorption, producing covalent bonds between −NH2/–NH– of primary/secondary amides and Hg(II),
along with the formation of ionic (I) and monodentate (M)/bidentate
bridging (BB- type coordinate bonds within the increasingly available
−COO– of GGAMSAASP18 with adsorbed Hg(II).
Indeed, −COO– of GGAMSAASP18 formed coordinate
bonds with Hg(II), preferentially via the M mode, that could also
be realized from the appreciably intense νas(−COO–) at 1614 cm–1 and characteristic
Δν of 210 cm–1 in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18
(Table 1).44 However, lesser probability of the BB mode between
Hg(II) and −COO– of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18
was also envisaged from the appearance of a shoulder at 1558 cm–1, attributed to νas(−COO–). On the contrary, interactions between Hg(II) and
−COO– in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14 were actuated
preferably via the BB mode instead of the M mode (Table 1). Additionally, bidentate chelating
(BC) mode was also observed in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14, suggesting
the prevalence of diversified interactions among Hg(II) and −COO– in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14. It was believed that
the possible penetration of Hg(II) into the core of GGAMSAASP14 led
to a more uniform distribution of Hg(II) throughout the surface and
the bulk of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14, and hence, variegated interactions
between Hg(II) and −COO– were feasible in
Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14 (Scheme 2). In fact, better penetration of Hg(II) into the network
of GGAMSAASP14 was also rationalized from the occurrence of new peaks
at 3617, 3606, 3593, and 3574 cm–1, suggesting the
alteration in O–H str. because of hampering
of mutual H-bonding of O–H and primary amides, as primary amides
were involved in the covalent bonding with adsorbed Hg(II) in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14.
On the contrary, relatively restricted penetration of Hg(II) in GGAMSAASP18
was envisaged through the arrival of fewer number of new peaks at
3634 and 3592 cm–1 in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18.
Though the attachment tendency of Hg(II) with O-donors was less preferred,
deposition of insoluble Hg(OH)2 at pHi >
5.0
on both the GGAMSAASP surfaces was determined via appearance of small
peaks at 3827/3828 cm–1 in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18/14.49

Individual MV adsorption onto GGAMSAASPs affected the H-bonding
environment within GGAMSAASP18, as realized from the changes in the
O–H str. vibrations involved in both strong
and weak H-bonding. In this context, the peak at 3655 cm–1 of GGAMSAASP18 disappeared (Figure 1b), together with the appearance of a new peak at 3593
cm–1 in MV–GGAMSAASP18, in consequence to
the deprotonation of numerous −COOH into −COO– at alkaline pHi. Adsorption of MV and the accompanied
conversion of −COOH into −COO– resulted
in an appreciable reduction in the overall intensities and positions
of the peaks corresponding to strongly H-bonded O–H str. in MV–GGAMSAASP18. Especially, a couple of relatively
intense peaks at 2352 and 2346 cm–1 of GGAMSAASP18
were shifted to produce peaks of appreciably lower intensities at
2356 and 2350 cm–1 in MV–GGAMSAASP18. On
the contrary, relatively feeble changes were manifested in MV–GGAMSAASP14.
However, O–H str. peaks at 3645, 3564, and
3542 cm–1 of GGAMSAASP14 disappeared during MV adsorption.
In fact, the conversion of −COOH into −COO– in MV–GAMSAASP18 was relatively intense and thus considerably
shifted the νas(−COO–) and
νs(−COO–) peaks to 1558
and 1406 cm–1, respectively, than that in GGAMSAASP18.
Moreover, only I-type interactions between MV cations (MV+) and −COO– in MV–GGAMSAASPs was
confirmed from the Δν values of 151 and 154 cm–1 lying well within 136–164 cm–1. Followed
by MV adsorption, almost similar but lesser prominent changes were
observed in MV–GGAMSAASP14 because of lower I-interactions
between MV+ and relatively fewer number of −COO– in MV–GGAMSAASP14. In this context, adsorption
of MV+ on both the GGAMSAASPs was also apprehended from
the arrival of distinct and intense peaks at 1321/1322 cm–1 in MV–GGAMSAASP18/14, corresponding to the C–N str. vibrations of the terminal saturated dimethylamino
groups of MV.50

Several significant
changes, especially in the H-bonding environment,
were observed during the combined adsorption of Hg(II) and MV. Again,
during Hg(II)–MV synergistic adsorption, reappearance of GG
specific peaks at 3645 and 3564 cm–1 (Figure 1b), lost earlier during individual
MV or Hg(II) adsorption, could be explained by the mutual bonding
between MV and Hg(II) via conversion of some free functional groups
of both adsorbates to the bound state, which resulted in some unoccupied
functional groups of the adsorbent, as realized from retaining of
those O–H str. peaks within Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP14.
This signified the prevalence of a strong Hg(II)–MV interaction
that ultimately weakened the adsorbent–adsorbate interaction.
Mutual Hg(II)–MV interaction in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18
also obliterated several less intense O–H str. peaks within 3500–3700 cm–1, present earlier
in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18 and MV–GGAMSAASP18. Moreover,
complete disappearance of the Hg(OH)2 specific peak at
3827 and 3828 cm–1 in both the Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs
suggested the role of Hg(II)–MV interaction in arresting the
formation of Hg(OH)2. Furthermore, mutual Hg(II)–MV
interaction in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs resulted in significant
changes in C–N str. of terminal saturated
dimethylamino groups of MV, realized from the significant shifting
of peaks from 1321/1322 cm–1 in MV–GGAMSAASP18/14
to 1315/1318 cm–1 in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18/14
(Figure 1b). Indeed,
such remarkable shifting of peaks toward a lower frequency might be
possible in consequence to the formation of coordinate bonding between
Hg(II) and −NHMe/–NMe2 of MV. Earlier, Jia
et al. reported coordinate bonding between −NMe2 of malachite green and Hg(II) to produce a Hg(II)–thymine-rich
DNA–MG complex, wherein Hg(II) bridged the two thymine bases.46 In fact, mutual interactions between Hg(II)
and MV carried out considerable shifting of the characteristic Hg–N
peak from 507/511 cm–1 in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18/14
to 510/516 cm–1 in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP/14.

The prevalence of methylene (−CH2−) and methine (>CH−)
linkages in the backbone of AMSAASP was determined through the appearance
of characteristic peaks (Figure 2a) within 0.81–1.55 and 2.06–2.60 ppm,
respectively. However, the symbolic peaks of −CH2– and >CH– protons in GGAMSAASP14
appeared within 0.81–1.56 and 2.06–2.80 ppm, respectively,
suggesting the existence of relatively variegated >CH– protons as a consequence of the diversified branching network
in GGAMSAASP14 (Figure 2b).51 In addition, complete disappearance
of several characteristic peaks of vinyl protons within 6.03–6.59,
5.70–6.30, and 5.59–6.13 ppm for SA, AM, and MBA, (Figure S2), respectively, indicated the comprehensive
attainment of copolymerization reaction between SA and AM along with
the cross-linking via MBA. Indeed, such cross-linking was rationalized
through the appearance of characteristic −CH2– peaks at 4.25 and 4.66 ppm in AMSAASP and GGAMSAASP14,
respectively.2 In addition, the arrival
of new peaks from 3.45 to 3.61 ppm in the spectra of both AMSAASP14
and GGAMSAASP14 confirmed the presence of −CH2– of −CH2–NH–(C=O)–,52 appearing through the free radical chain propagation
reaction between −C(=O)NH• and SA.
Furthermore, −NH– of cross-linked MBA,
newly formed moieties, and amide appeared at 6.85, 7.72, and 8.04
ppm in AMSAASP and 6.87, 7.56, and 8.04 ppm in GGAMSAASP14,2 respectively. However, GGAMSAASP14 was also associated
with some distinct peaks at 3.87, 3.67, and 5.40/5.33 ppm for galactose-5/mannose-4
(gal-5/mann4), gal-/mann-6, and anomeric protons of GG, respectively.53,54 In fact, the grafting of AMSAASP through −CH2OH of GG was also confirmed from the significant shifting
of the characteristic −CH2–O
peak from 3.67 of GG to 3.61 ppm in GGAMSAASP14.53,54

XPS Analyses
GGAMSAASP14 and Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14
were thoroughly analyzed by XPS to determine the adsorption mechanism
and variegated interactions between Hg(II) and GGAMSAASP14 from the
relative changes in the binding energies (BEs) and peak intensities.
In this context, the deconvoluted O 1s spectrum of GGAMSAASP14 showed
three characteristic peaks with BEs of 530.82, 535.97, and 540.73
eV (Figure 3c) for O=C of −COOH,55O–H of −COOH,56 and
O-atom shake-up satellite band of −CO–NH–CH2– in GGAMSAASP14, respectively. Earlier, the presence
of the −CO–NH–CH2– segment
in GGAMSAASP14 was also ascertained from 1H NMR and FTIR
analyses. However, the O 1s peak at 540.73 eV indicated the prevalence
of low-dimensional H-bonded water clusters around GGAMSAASP14.57 In this context, the O 1s peaks at 530.82 and
535.97 eV of GGAMSAASP14 were shifted to 531.80 and 536.02 eV (Figure 3f), respectively,
indicating conversion of −COOH into −COO– and inferior interactions of Hg(II) with O–H
of −COOH, respectively. In addition, the O 1s peak at 540.73
eV of the low-dimensional H-bonded water cluster was significantly
shifted to 540.01 eV in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14 because of the change
in H-bonding, also apprehended earlier from the FTIR analysis. Moreover,
the deconvoluted C 1s peaks at 284.96 and 285.76 eV (Figure 3a) were ascribed to C–C55 and C=O
of amide/acid fragments58 in GGAMSAASP14,
respectively. As C-ends of C–C and C=O were indirectly involved in Hg(II) adsorption, these C
1s peaks were shifted slightly to 284.95 and 285.92 eV (Figure 3d), associated with the lowering
in the respective peak intensities. Furthermore, the N 1s peak at
399.95 eV (Figure 3b) was attributed to the prevalent O=C–NH2 in GGAMSAASP14. In fact, a significant shifting of
the N 1s peak form 399.95 to 399.35 eV (Figure 3e) was observed in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14
as a consequence of Hg(II) adsorption. In fact, the formation of a
covalent bond between the N-end of O=C–NH2 and Hg(II), such as O=C–HN–Hg(II)–NH–C=O,
was ascertained from the lowering of such a BE. Additionally, coordinate
bonding between Hg(II) and N-donors was also rationalized from the
significant increase in the N 1s BE up to 403.11 eV. As adsorption
of Hg(II) was mostly governed by the greater relative enhancement
of primary amides, higher ACs were also noted in GGAMSAASP14. Additionally,
BEs of both Hg 4f7/2 and Hg 4f5/2 substantially
decreased to 99.49/100.60 and 103.52/104.70 eV (Figure 3g), respectively, in comparison to the characteristic
BEs at 102.58/106.68 eV of Hg 4f7/2/Hg 4f5/2 for HgCl2.59 In fact, surface
deposition of HgCl2 on GGAMSAASP14 was also apprehended
from the appearance of Hg 4f7/2 BE at 102.20 eV.

TGA Analyses
TGA
thermogram of GG (Figure 4a) envisaged the removal of
loosely bound moisture and volatile components within 50–130
°C, followed by the commencement of the major degradation at
230 °C.60 In fact, such a rapid degradation
continued up to 320 °C resulting in the mass loss of 49 wt %.
In succession, slightly delayed thermal degradation caused a mass
loss of 71 wt % at 400 °C.60 Indeed,
being a polysaccharide, GG went through a complicated thermal degradation
process, constituting initial depolymerization via random chain scission
followed by molecular rearrangements, resulting in the formation of
an almost negligible residue at 700 °C.

and (d) GGAMSAASP18, and MV–/Hg(II)–/Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18.

Followed by the completion of
moisture loss and associated anhydride
formation via dehydration of neighboring −COOH within 200 °C,
the thermal decomposition of AMSAASP progressed through three successive
temperature ranges: 200–350, 350–420, and 420–500
°C (Figure 4a).
In fact, the first stage of decomposition was associated with the
conversion of neighboring amides of AMSAASP into imides, followed
by the degradation of −COO– and imides, and
finally, the third stage was attributed to the formation of paraffinic
materials via scission of the AMSAASP backbone.61 However, significantly high residues of 36.14/33.90 wt
% were ascribed to the formation of thermoresistant inorganic salts
and carbon of AMSAASP14/18. Interestingly, a marginally lower amount
of residue for AMSAASP18 than AMSAASP14 was associated with the formation
of a relatively higher extent of anhydride via dehydration of the
frequently available neighbouring −COOH in AMSAASP18 at the
initial stage, followed by decarboxylation of anhydrides in the higher
temperature range.

Grafting of GG with AMSAASPs could be possible
via attachment of
GG with either SA or AM. Therefore, the combined thermal decomposition
behavior of both GGSA and GGAM should be manifested during the thermal
decomposition of both the GGAMSAASPs. In fact, GGAMSAASP18 showed
better thermal resistance up to 420 °C, as compared to both the
AMSAASPs. Thereafter, the degradation profile of both GGAMSAASP18
and AMSAASP18 remained almost similar up to 600 °C (Figure 4a), and thereafter,
AMSAASP18 was found to be more thermoresistant than GGAMSAASP18, leading
to a significantly higher residue for AMSAASP18. Almost similar thermal
degradation contours were observed within 600–700 °C in
the comparative plots of both GGAMSAASP14 and AMSAASP14. Indeed, relatively
lower residues in both GGAMSAASPs were rationalized by the inclusion
of negligible residue-forming GG within AMSAASPs (Figure 4a). Thus, during the first
two stages of decomposition, the slightly better thermal resistance
of GGAMSAASP14 over AMSAASP14 was attributed to the restricted conversion
of amides to imides by the incorporation of grafted GG chains in between
two closely spaced amide side chains. In a similar fashion, the grafted
GG chains resisted anhydride formation via arresting the dehydration
of neighbouring −COOH at the initial stage and associated decarboxylation
of anhydrides in the later stages by partially affecting the close
proximity between the adjacent −COOH. Interestingly, the overall
thermal stability of GGAMSAASP14 was considerably inferior to that
of GGAMSAASP18. Indeed, within 340–500 °C, significant
deterioration in the thermal resistance of GGAMSAASP14 was observed
as compared to that of GGAMSAASP18. Nevertheless, GGAMSAASP14 showed
superior thermal resistance up to 260 °C as compared to both
the AMSAASPs. It was believed that grafting of GG in GGAMSAASP14 was
relatively unstable and less intimate in comparison to that observed
in GGAMSAASP18. Such phenomena could also be correlated with the relatively
enhanced thermal stability of GGAA over GGAM.60 Accordingly, GGAMSAASP18 reflected a superior thermal resistance
due to relatively higher availability of GGSA moieties in the network.
Moreover, because M(II) adsorption was conducted at pHi > pHPZC, an enormous portion of −COOH was converted
to −COO– and thus drastically reduced the
extent of moisture loss within 30–200 °C, via anhydride
formation from the neighboring −COOH of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs
than that of GGAMSAASPs (Figure 4a). In this regard, a substantial reduction in the
moisture loss was observed for Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18 by the relative
enhancement of −COO–, generated via ionization
of the abundant −COOH in GGAMSAASP18.

In fact, the drastic
degradation of both the Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs
was observed beyond 290 °C, and such a steep downfall continued
up to 390 °C resulting in 50 wt % mass loss within 290–390
°C. Invariably, the mass loss was even more rapid in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14,
containing greater proportion of amides because of the relatively
enhanced preferential interaction of Hg(II) with N-donors. Such a
phenomenon was associated mostly with the loss of amides in the first
stage of thermal decomposition, within 200–350 °C, followed
by the destruction of imides from 350 to 420 °C, resulting in
the loss of N-donors, such as amides and imides, and thus facilitating
the loss of mercury vapor at 350 °C. However, beyond 390 °C,
the thermal decomposition was noted to be deaccelerated, as the amide
destruction process was almost completed and the usual degradation
process of polymer backbone commenced. In this regard, the decarboxylation
of intermediate anhydrides appeared to impose little effect on the
thermal decomposition of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18 throughout the
entire degradation process, as unlike N-donors, O-donors possessed
little tendency to interact with Hg(II). However, considerable extent
of residues in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs, though lesser than GGAMSAASPs,
were attributed to the prevalence of thermally stable inorganic components
of AMSAASPs present within Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs. In fact, the
residue contents of various hydrogels were in the following order:
GGAMSAASP18 (29.90 wt %) > GGAMSAASP14 (24.40 wt %) > Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18
(20.45 wt %) > Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14 (9.84 wt %). However,
the
relatively lower residue for Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs than GGAMSAASPs
was ascribed to the gradual replacement of Na+ by Hg(II)
during adsorption and rapid evaporation of adsorbed mercury from Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs.
Notably, the difference between the amount of residues for Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs
(i.e., 20.45 – 9.84 = 10.61 wt %) was much higher than the
corresponding difference between GGAMSAASPs (i.e., 29.9 – 24.4
= 5.5 wt %). One possible reason behind such an increase in the residue
difference could be the higher Hg(II) adsorption by the amide-rich
GGAMSAASP14 because Hg(II) preferably interacted with amides to produce
thermolabile Hg–N covalent bonds and >N–Hg–N<
cross-links, as envisaged earlier from FTIR analyses.

In contrast
to Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs, MV–GGAMSAASPs demonstrated
superior thermal resistance along with higher residues than the respective
GGAMSAASPs (Figure 4a). This phenomenon could be accounted for the higher individual
thermal stability of MV over mercury along with relative lowering
in the thermal degradation rate of MV up to 400 °C. Moreover,
being flat and bulky, MV molecules could be involved in stacking interactions
among themselves and with GGAMSAASPs, along with the usual formation
of ionic bonds, leading to the enhanced thermal stability of MV–GGAMSAASPs.

Interestingly, both of the Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs showed
inferior thermal resistances within 30–320 °C, as compared
to the respective MV–/Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs (Figure 4a).Because thermal stability
at a lower temperature region was governed mainly by the physical
interactions, such bonding among GGAMSAASPs and each of Hg(II)–MV
was affected by the mutual interactions between individual adsorbates.
In fact, thermal stabilities of both the Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs
were noted to be improved within 320–600 °C and became
even better than Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs. However, thermal resistances
of both Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs were significantly poor
than the respective MV–GGAMSAASPs. Such a phenomenon also indicated
a stronger mutual interaction between MV, Hg(II), and GGAMSAASPs within
Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs, which arrested the thermal degradation
via resisting the evaporation of mercury. Beyond 600 °C, the
thermal degradations of both Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs were
accelerated, and the extent of residues became almost similar to those
of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs.

DSC Analyses
In
the DSC thermogram of GG (Figure 4b), the endothermic
transitions at 76 and 239 °C were ascribed to the loss of moisture
and the cleavage of gal and mann units from the GG backbone, respectively.62 Interestingly, the wide decomposition peak at
239 °C was considerably lower than the peaks at 253 and 248 °C,62 which could be attributed to the shorter chain
length and hence the lesser average molecular weight of GG than that
of the average (i.e., 889 742.06 Da). Moreover, the appearance
of the shoulder peak at 296 °C was also in agreement with the
reported work.62

Interestingly, the
DSC thermogram of AMSAASP18 (Figure 4b) exhibited a sharp endothermic peak at 159 °C,
whereas the nature of initial thermal transition for AMSAASP14 was
relatively broad and shifted to a higher temperature at 186 °C.
As compared to AMSAASP18, relatively restricted endothermic transition
in AMSAASP14 could be attributed to lesser anhydride formation from
relatively fewer number of neighbouring −COOH in AMSAASP14.
In fact, the formation of anhydride and the associated endothermic
peak within 150–300 °C was feasible only when the prevalence
of −COOH was more predominant than −COO–.2 Indeed, considerably higher thermal
stability of AMSAASP14 over AMSAASP18 was reflected from the occurrence
of endothermic transitions at relatively higher temperatures of 242,
344, and 433 °C for AMSAASP14 than the respective peaks at 237,
344, and 431 °C for AMSAASP18. Notably, the endothermic peaks
at 242 and 237 °C for AMSAASP14 and AMSAASP18, respectively,
were attributed to the conversion of amides into imides, whereas the
breakdown of imides and anhydrides was predominant at the higher temperature
region. As established from the NMR and FTIR analyses, AMSAASP14 was
constituted of numerous −CH2–NH–(C=O)–
moieties produced via free-radical interactions between SA and •NH–(C=O)–
during the synthesis of AMSAASP14, and such moieties eventually provided
marginal improvement in the thermal stability of AMSAASP14 over AMSAASP18
throughout the entire temperature range. In fact, the enhanced conversion
of −(C=O)–NH2 to −CH2–NH–(C=O)– was believed to be responsible
behind the restricted degradation of amides to imides, leading to
the overall retardation in the decomposition of AMSAASP14 in later
stages. Eventually, such marginally improved thermal stability of
AMSAASP14 over AMSAASP18 generated a higher residue for AMSAASP14
in the TGA analyses.

Grafting of GG brought about several changes
in the DSC thermograms
of both the AMSAASPs. For instance, the prevalence of two sharp peaks
at 60 and 240 °C in GGAMSAASP14 could be related to the GG-specific
endothermic transitions at 76 and 239 °C, respectively. Moreover,
the broad peak at 181 °C in GGAMSAASP14 could be correlated with
the similar endothermic transitions of AMSAASP14 at 186 °C. However,
in the DSC thermogram of GGAMSAASP18, an extensively broad peak centered
at 130 °C was generated, which was related to both GG and AMSAASP18-specific
thermal transitions. In this context, the sharp endothermic peak at
159 °C for AMSAASP18 completely disappeared for GGAMSAASP18,
suggesting extensive phase mixing that significantly affected the
anhydride formation-driven heat absorption and moisture loss. Indeed,
in comparison to GGAMSAASP14, the anhydride formation and associated
heat absorption would mostly be affected in GGAMSAASP18, owing to
the abrupt decrease in the neighboring −COOH via incorporation
of grafted GG chains in between the adjacent −COOH. Interestingly,
the occurrence of two broad and intense peaks at 230 and 352 °C
in the thermogram of GGAMSAASP14, absent in both AMSAASP14 and GGAMSAASP18,
indicated the enhanced contribution of frequently available thermo-labile
GGAM segments in destabilizing the GGAMSAASP14 network. It was believed
that the relatively easier breakdown of GGAM, as compared to GGSA,
might accelerate the decomposition cascade via cyclization of amides
as well as easier decomposition of thermally detached GG chains from
the numerous thermo-labile GGAM segments of GGAMSAASP14.

The
appearance of two new exothermic peaks at 194/202 °C (Figure 4c,d) in the DSC thermogram
of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14/18 indicated the possible displacement
reaction between the adsorbed HgCl2/Hg(OH)2 and
Al-pan.63 In fact, the deposition of Hg(OH)2 on both the Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs had been established
from the respective FTIR findings (Figure 1b). As compared to Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18,
the more intense exothermic peak of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14 could
be ascribed to the enhanced displacement reaction between the higher
number of adsorbed Hg(II) in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14 and Al-pan.
Moreover, the adsorption of Hg(II) onto GGAMSAASP14 resulted in the
complete disappearance of broad and intense endothermic peaks at 230
and 352 °C. In fact, the prevalence of thermally stable >N–Hg–N<
cross-links, produced via interactions between amides and adsorbed
Hg(II) in the bulk and on the surface of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14,
as established earlier from NMR and FTIR analyses, resisted the thermal
degradation of amides because free amides were rare in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14.
Moreover, the appearance of sharp endothermic peaks at 223 °C
for Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14 could be compared to a similar peak
for the chitosan–Hg(II) complex, actuated via complexation
between N-donors and Hg(II).64 However,
fewer availability of >N–Hg–N< cross-links and
accordingly
greater extent of free amides in the bulk of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18
were also substantiated from the occurrence of a relatively broad
endothermic peak at 288 °C in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18 than
the low intense endothermic peaks at relatively higher temperatures
of 296 and 317 °C for Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14.

The DSC
thermograms of MV–GGAMSAASPs envisaged almost complete
disappearance of the broad endothermic peaks within 150–300
°C, especially in MV–GGAMSAASP18. This phenomenon could
be attributed to the substantial conversion of −COOH into −COO– during MV adsorption onto GGAMSAASPs at alkaline pHi, especially in MV–GGAMSAASP18, leading to the minimization
of anhydride formation possibility via dehydration of fewer number
of available −COOH. Because GGAMSAASP18 contained a higher
amount of −COOH, the impact of alkaline pH-driven conversion
of −COOH into −COO– would be the maximum
in GGAMSAASP18. Altogether, MV–GGAMSAASPs showed greater thermal
stabilities as compared to both GGAMSAASPs and Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs,
as realized from the prevalence of a relatively low intense endothermic
peak at a higher temperature in the thermograms of MV–GGAMSAASPs.
Such phenomena were also apprehended earlier during TGA analyses,
and the increased thermal resistance of MV–GGAMSAASPs could
be correlated with the cross-linking ability of MV molecules via multipoint
attachment within the hydrogel matrices.

In both the Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs,
the disappearance
of the exothermic peaks at 194 and 202 °C (Figure 4c,d) indicated the absence of free Hg(II)
as Hg(OH)2/HgCl2 at Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP
surfaces, established earlier from the FTIR results. In fact, the
obsolescence of free Hg(II) as HgCl2/Hg(OH)2 could only be made possible via formation of a stable Hg(II)–MV
complex, and this was unable to undergo amalgamation with Al-pan.
In fact, Hg(II)–MV interaction resulted in impaired stability
of both the Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs than MV–GGAMSAASPs,
preferably in the lower temperature region, together with the reappearance
of a relatively less intense and broad endothermic peak at 234 °C
in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP14, similar to that of GGAMSAASP14.
Similarly, a small endothermic peak at 245 °C in MV–GGAMSAASP18
was shifted to 225 °C in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18,
which suggested easier conversion of free amides to imides. Indeed,
such amides would be generated due to a mutual Hg(II)–MV interaction.
Again, such a mutual interaction was also responsible for the possible
shifting of the endothermic peak from 340 °C in MV–GGAMSAASP18
to 334 °C in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18. Moreover, the
arrival of multiple endothermic peaks within 340–371 °C
in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP14 suggested variegated interactions
among MV, Hg(II), and GGAMSAASP14, which were not found in MV–/Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14.

XRD Analyses
The intimate phase mixing and hence dislocation
of regular spatial arrangements through the grafting of GG onto terpolymers
in both the GGAMSAASPs was comprehended via complete disappearance
of characteristic GG peaks at 20.44°, 40.57°, and 70.66°
(Figure 5a),62 along with the simultaneous absence of the terpolymeric
peaks. However, relatively higher crystallinity of AMSAASP14 over
AMSAASP18 was realized from the appearance of a couple of peaks at
23.21° and 29.64° in AMSAASP14, as compared to the comparatively
broader and lesser intense peak at 32.65° for AMSAASP18 (Figure 5a). In fact, such
an enhanced crystallinity of AMSAASP14 over AMSAASP18 was also observed
in the respective GGAMSAASPs through the appearance of a relatively
ordered structure in GGAMSAASP14 than GGAMSAASP18.

Figure 5 XRD of (a) GG, AMSAASP14/18,
GGAMSAASP14/18, (b) GGAMSAASP14, MV–/Hg(II)–/Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP14,
(c) GGAMSAASP18, and MV–/Hg(II)–/Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18.

Indeed, some new peaks were generated
in MV–GGAMSAASPs,
which were not found in GGAMSAASPs. In fact, the XRD spectrum of MV–GGAMSAASP14
showed two new peaks at 36.55° and 44.96°, along with the
symbolic peak at 30.74° for GGAMSAASP14 (Figure 5b). Of these, the peak at 36.55° was
ascribed to the shortest distance of 2.46 Å between every two
carbon atoms, allocated at the meta-positions in the benzene rings
of MV. However, the new prominent peak at 45.09°, having d-spacing = 2.01 Å at n = 1, correlated
with the spacing of liquid benzene (i.e., 2.00 Å). Similarly,
the arrival of a new peak at 22.96° in MV–GGAMSAASP18
(Figure 5c) might be
attributed to the interatomic distances of 3.87 Å in the planar
aromatic structure of MV+, attached on the GGAMSAASP18
surface. In this context, a similar interatomic distance of 3.83 Å
was also substantiated by the radial distance of 3.75 Å of a
single layer of graphite comprising of interconnected benzene rings.65

The diffractogram of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14
possessed several
new peaks, of which the peaks at 21.79° and 43.85° could
be related to the characteristic peaks of HgCl266 that confirmed the prevalence of HgCl2 crystals on the surface of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14. On the contrary,
such a kind of appearance was not realized on the surface of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18.
In fact, deposition of lesser amount of HgCl2 on the Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18
surface was also substantiated from the appearance of a less intense
exothermic peak in the respective DSC thermogram (Figure 4c,d). However, such HgCl2 peaks could not be detected in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP,
corroborating the mutual interaction of Hg(II) and MV at the Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP
interfaces, as demonstrated earlier in the respective FTIR spectra
(Figure 1b). Nevertheless,
despite the Hg(II)–MV interaction, the characteristic MV+ peak at 23.01° prevailed in both the Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs.
However, the appearance of an extra symbolic MV+ peak at
45.10° in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18 indicated higher
population of MV on the GGAMSAASP18 surface. In a nutshell, individual
adsorption of Hg(II) resulted in a significant deterioration of the
crystallinity of both the GGAMSAASP surfaces, whereas individual MV
adsorption enhanced the crystallinity. However, the combined Hg(II)–MV
adsorption ensued intermediate level of crystallinity, which reemphasized
the loss of an ordered structure via mutual Hg(II)–MV interactions.

FESEM and EDX Analyses
From the FESEM microphotographs
of AMSAASP14/18, distinct phase boundaries were observed (Figure 6a,b). These relatively
heterogeneous surfaces showed several discontinuous cracks. However,
such surfaces of GGAMSAASPs were devoid of such distinct phase boundaries
and appeared to be smooth, well-organized, and compact as a result
of finer intermixing through the grafting of GG within the network
of AMSAASPs (Figure 6c,d). Nevertheless, an uneven and heterogeneous surface appeared
because of deposition of Hg(II) onto GGAMSAASPs (Figure 6e,f). In fact, the maximum
Hg(II) deposition ascertained from the ACs of GGAMSAASP14, as compared
to that of GGAMSAASP18, was also comprehended through the appearance
of a fully heterogeneous surface in FESEM and attainment of the maximum
Hg(II) deposition from EDX analyses. In this context, formation of
covalent, coordinate, and/or ionic bonds between GGAMSAASPs and Hg(II)
were eventually realized from the appearance of variegated Hg(II)
peaks in the EDX spectrum (inset of Figure 6e,f).

RSM-Optimized Hydrogel
Synthesis
Phase-1: Screening of Synthetic Parameters To Identify the Key
Variables
In the phase-1 analysis, a set of 19 experiments
were conducted for the screening of the most significant variables
based on the resolution-IV design (Table 2). The maximum/minimum levels chosen for
such analysis were 6.25/25.00, 0.20/0.60, 2.00/4.00, 1.00/5.00, and
4.00/10.00 wt % for A, B, C, D, and E, respectively,
whereas the maximum/minimum ESR values were varied within 4.20–16.80.
However, only three variables, that is, A, D, and E, were observed to cross the Bonferroni
limit of 4.3817 in the Pareto chart (Figure S3) and hence considered for further CCD analysis. In addition, the
Pareto chart also recognized BE as the only 2FI term
to impart adequate effect on ESR. Therefore, these four terms, that
is, three 1 factor and one 2FI, were chosen for constituting a regression
model whose applicability was evaluated from the following second-order
polynomial equation (eq 1). 1

In fact, the chosen
model was found to be sufficiently significant
owing to very high adj. R2 value (i.e.,
0.9745), closeness of adj./pred. R2 values
(i.e., 0.9745/0.8995), and a very low p-value (<0.0001)
(Table 3).

Phase-2:
CCD Optimization of the Three Most Significant Process
Variables
CCD, a standard RSM design, was adopted to optimize
the three most significant variables of synthesis, that is, A, D and E, to understand
the individual and/or interactive effects on the response, that is,
ESR. In this context, CCD is a combination of 2n, 2n, and nc numbers of factorial
design, axial, and central points, respectively. The predesigned experiments
were performed randomly for minimizing the effect of uncontrolled
factors.67 The results were examined and
correlated with input variables using the second-order empirical polynomial eq 2. 2  Here, Y, β0, βi, βii, and βij represent the predicted
response, constant, linear, quadratic, and interaction coefficients,
respectively. In this regard, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) table
was studied to justify the significance and adequacy of the predicted
model by taking input variables within 6.25–25.00 wt %, 1.00–6.36
wt %, and 4–13.50 wt %. The input variables, both in coded
and real, and the response, as generated by the software, are listed
in Table S1. In this context, ANOVA table
was also incorporated to study the individual and/or synergistic effects
of these variables via estimating R2 values
to correlate the experimental and predicted data at 95% confidence
level (Table S2).67 In addition, the sequential model sum of squares (type I) and the
model summary statistics tests were also conducted to rationalize
the interactive effects of A, D,
and E on ESR via linear, 2FI, quadratic, and cubic
models. However, the quadratic model was the best for determining
the experimental data because of the highest R2 values (i.e., 0.9948) and the closest resemblance of adj.
and pred. R2 values (0.9901 and 0.9597).
The fitment of experimental data to eq 2 resulted in eq 3. 3  

The response surface
plots, showing
the interactive effects of AD, AE, and DE, are given in Figure 7. In fact, the overall optimization was carried
out to obtain the perfect conditions for synthesizing a sustainable
hydrogel having the maximum ESR. In this regard, it is also essential
to mention that the hydrogel having higher swellability in water corresponds
to a higher AC. Thus, in the present study, the GGAMSAASP possessing
the maximum ESR has been rationally selected for the adsorptive removal
of MV and Hg(II). Thus, A, D, and E “in range” and ESR “maximize”
were considered in the numerical optimization section. However, the
optimum conditions for attaining the maximum ESR of 21.41 were 8.98,
1.00, and 10.00 wt % for A, D, and E, respectively.

Adsorption Isotherm Study
The nature of adsorbate–adsorbent
interaction during isothermal adsorption can be rationalized through
fitment of experimental data to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips (eqs S1–S4) isotherm models (Figure 8, S4). In the present case, adsorption isotherm studies were conducted
by taking 0.025 g of GGAMSAASPs and 5–30 ppm dye solutions
at pHi = 7/9 for Hg(II)–MV within 293–323
K. However, the Langmuir model was found to be the best for explaining
the experimental equilibrium data of Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14/18
(Table 4) in the entire
temperature and concentration ranges (Figure 8a and inset). According to the presumptions
of the Langmuir model, monolayer adsorption of Hg(II) on the structurally
consistent hydrogel surface could be interpreted. From Table 4, higher qmax of Hg(II) was observed for GGAMSAASP14, which indicated
greater affinity of Hg(II) on GGAMSAASP14. This phenomenon could be
explained by considering higher covalent bonding affinity of Hg(II)
with the N-center. In fact, higher affinity of Hg(II) to produce O=C–NH–Hg(II)–HN–C=O
had already been recognized from the respective XPS analysis via considerable
shifting of N 1s BE from 399.95 to 399.35 eV. This phenomenon also
indicated the prevalent chemisorption for Hg(II) on GGAMSAASPs. However,
for both GGAMSAASPs, qmax was found to
increase with increasing temperature. Again, separation factor (RL) (eq 4) was found to lie within 0–1, which indicated the
prevalence of favorable adsorption. 4

The equilibrium adsorption of MV followed the Sips/Langmuir
isotherm
models for GGAMSAASP18/14 (Figure 8b,c). However, relatively higher qmax was observed for GGAMSAASP18 (Table 4). Therefore, the enhancement of −COO– facilitated the formation of the ionic interaction
between −NHMe+/–NMe2+ of MV and −COO– on the surface of GGAMSAASP18
and thus the attainment of higher AC, evidenced from the respective
FTIR and TGA analyses. Again, kS and kL were found to increase with the enhancement
of temperature.2

Adsorption Thermodynamics
Study
Thermodynamic spontaneity
of chemisorption was ascertained from the measurements of ΔG0 values using eq 5. 5  Here, kd, known
as the distribution coefficient, can be defined by eq 6. 6  

In the entire concentration and temperature
ranges of the experiment (Table 5), ΔG0 values were
negative, which indicated thermal spontaneity of chemisorption.23 From Table 5, higher −ΔG0 values were observed for MV–GGAMSAASP18 than for MV–GGAMSAASP14,
as also indicated from the respective qmax values. In fact, the values of −ΔG0 were found to increase with the rise in temperature
from 293 to 323 K, reflecting a more favorable adsorption at a higher
temperature. Conversely, for Hg(II) adsorption, −ΔG0 values were found to be higher for GGAMSAASP14
than for GGAMSAASP18, indicating higher adsorption feasibility for
GGAMSAASP14. The prevalence of larger number of N-centers in GGAMSAASP14
alleviated Hg(II) adsorption, whereas the population of a larger amount
of −COO– facilitated the adsorption of MV.
Additionally, the exothermic nature of adsorption was rationalized
by the negative values of ΔH0 (Figure S5e–h), whereas +ΔS0 values (eq 7) suggested fair affinity of MV/Hg(II) onto GGAMSAASP14/18

Adsorption Kinetics Study
The fitment
of pseudo-second-order
kinetics (eq 8), ascertained
by the higher R2, F,
and the closest proximity of qe,exp and qe,cal (Table 4), for MV and Hg(II) indicated the prevalence of chemisorption
in the entire temperature (Figure S5a–d) and concentration ranges of the experiment (Figure 9a–d). In fact, the existence of such
chemisorption was also apprehended by the increasing trend of the
pseudo-second-order rate constant, k2 (g
mg–1 min–1), with increasing temperature
for GGAMSAASPs. The higher k2 for Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14
indicated the preferential Hg–N bond formation with the N-donor
ligand of AM, also harmonized from the XPS and FTIR analyses (Figures 1b and 3e). By contrast, the enhancement of k2 values for MV–GGAMSAASP18 was ascribed to the higher
number of −COO– in GGAMSAASP18. 8

Study of Diffusion Mechanism
The
plots of qt vs t0.5 (eq 9) of Hg(II)–MV
for GGAMSAASPs were found to possess three linear portions of variable
slopes and intercepts (Figure 9e,f), of which slopes of the second segments determined the
values of kip (Table 4). 9  

In
fact, the coexistence of bulk, film,
and pore/intraparticle diffusions for Hg(II)–MV could comprehensively
be rationalized by the appearance of such multilinear segments. However,
the prevalence of intraparticle diffusion was also confirmed by the
fitment of experimental data to the following nonlinear form of the
Boyd model (eq 10). 10  Here, qt/qe (mg g–1)
and Bt represent ACs
at time t/equilibrium and Boyd parameter, respectively.
However, Boyd plots for Hg(II)–MV were found to be linear (Figure S5k,l) and started from the origin that reflected the prevalence of pore
diffusion. Interestingly, the kip values
of Hg(II) was found to be higher in GGAMSAASP14 than in GGAMSAASP18.

Effect of Temperature on Adsorption Kinetics
The effect
of temperature on chemisorption kinetics was studied by taking 25
ppm Hg(II)–MV solutions at pHi = 7/9 and 0.025 g
of GGAMSAASPs at 296, 303, 310, and 317 K. As all dyes followed pseudo-second-order
kinetics, k2 at different temperatures
could be interrelated by the following Arrhenius type eq 11. 11  Here, k0 and Ea are the temperature independent factor (g
mg–1 min–1) and activation energy
of adsorption (kJ mol–1), respectively. Indeed,
from the slope of the linearized ln k2 vs 1/T plot, Ea of
adsorption can be evaluated (Figure S5i,j). However, Ea values for MV–Hg(II)
were found to be 24.35/20.20 and 23.95/21.37 kJ mol–1 onto GGAMSAASP18 and GGAMSAASP14, respectively, indicating the prevalence
of chemisorption in both the cases.68

Synergistic Adsorption of Hg(II) and MV by GGAMSAASPs
At
the beginning of simultaneous Hg(II) and MV adsorption by the
GGAMSAASPs, mutual interaction between Hg(II) and MV was reflected
via appearance of a strong hypochromic effect in the visible spectrum
of Hg(II) and MV than that of individual MV. In addition, a time-dependent
hypsochromic effect was also observed as a consequence of the Hg(II)–MV
interaction, resulting in a significant shift of λmax from 577.85 to 544.35 nm within 240 min. Mutual interaction between
triphenyl methane dyes (TPMDs) and M(II) were reported earlier during
quantifying M(II) in aqueous solution using TPMDs as indicators.24 It was believed that the instantaneous hypochromic
effect, together with the time-dependent hypsochromic effect, originated
from the delocalization of electrons in MV+ by Hg(II),
possibly via coordinate bond formation via electron donating −NHMe+/–NMe2+ moieties of MV to the
vacant orbitals of Hg(II). Moreover, like crystal violet cations,
MV+ should also exist as pyramidal and planar forms, with
considerable difference between the λmax values of
the two conformers. In fact, the λmax values for
planar and pyramidal conformers of the crystal violet cation are 557
and 590 nm, respectively. Accordingly, λmax for the
planar conformer of MV+ should be lower than the respective
pyramidal conformer. The coordinate bonding between Hg(II) and −NMe2/–NHMe moieties of MV+ should be more favorable
if the distance between the positively charged centers of the interacting
cations are maximized to ensure minimum repulsion between Hg(II) and
MV+ (Figure 10a,b). Invariably, the maximum separation between interacting
Hg(II) and MV+ could be accomplished if MV+ exists
as a planar form, wherein the positive charge is located at the terminal
positions. Accordingly, in the presence of Hg(II), the rapid equilibrium
between planar and pyramidal conformers should shift in favor of the
planar form of MV+, possessing lower λmax than the pyramidal conformer.

photographic images of (d/inset of d) MV–GGAMSAASP18/GGAMSAASP18
and (e/f) desorption/adsorption kinetics of MV.

Mutual interaction between Hg(II)–MV was also realized
from
the significant change in the UV region of the UV–vis spectra
of Hg(II) and MV. In the absence of Hg(II), the UV–vis spectra
of MV demonstrated a peak at 299.30 nm (inset of Figure 8b,c). However, as Hg(II) was
added to the MV solution, the MV specific peak at 299.35 nm was transformed
into a shoulder positioned at 301.80 nm. Earlier, researchers claimed
that significant interaction between aniline and Hg(II) would result
in an appreciable red shift of characteristic azine-based receptor.69 In the presence of Hg(II), shift of MV to a
higher wavelength should also be an outcome of the mutual Hg(II)–MV
interaction to produce at least a labile Hg(II)–MV complex.

Altogether, as compared to GGAMSAASP18, GGAMSAASP14 envisaged a
relatively better combined adsorption of MV–Hg(II), realized
from the superior hypochromic effect in the time-dependent visible
spectra for GGAMSAASP14. Such phenomena could be related to the relatively
greater availability of superficial −COO– on the GGAMSAASP18 surface that caused surface deposition of cationic
adsorbates, thereby resisting further penetration of the adsorbates
deep into the bulk. Indeed, as compared to GGAMSAASP18, relatively
greater adsorption of combined adsorbates by GGAMSAASP14 was also
realized from the greater residue difference between GGAMSAASP14 and
Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP14 (i.e., 24.34 – 11.52 =
12.82 wt %), as compared to the same between GGAMSAASP18 and Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASP18
(i.e., 29.86 – 21.91 = 7.95 wt %).

Desorption and Reusability
The recyclability of GGAMSAASPs
was explored through the repetitive adsorption studies at pHi = 9/7 for MV–Hg(II), followed by the desorption of MV–/Hg(II)–GGAMSAASPs
at 0.1 (N) NaCl/pHi = 2 (Figure 10c–f). Although, the desorption ratios
of both the GGAMSAASPs decreased gradually in the successive cycles,
the maximum desorptions of 95 and 85% were noted for MV–GGAMSAASP18/14
and Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18/14, respectively, upto the fourth cycle,
with the retention of the network. In fact, such results of desorption
could rationally be correlated with the formation of physicochemical
interactions between −NH2 of −CONH2, −COO– of GGAMSAASPs, and cationic N-centres
of MV–Hg(II), as evidenced earlier by FTIR, NMR, and XPS analyses.

Comparison of the Results
Several micro/nanomaterial-based
adsorbents, blends, homo/co/terpolymers, and IPN hydrogels for the
adsorptive removal of MV and Hg(II) from aqueous solutions of varying
initial concentrations (i.e., 1–3800 ppm), temperatures (i.e.,
288–323 K), and pHi values have been provided (Table S3). In this context, it is important to
note that the AC of any adsorbent not only depends on the initial
concentration but also is a function of the temperature and pHi. From Table S3, it could be observed
that the ACs of GGAMSAASPs were either closer to or much better than
previously reported adsorbents, within the specified working range.

Conclusions
This report not only describes the synthesis
of a novel sustainable
IPN superadsorbent but also develops eventually a new pathway for
the in situ green synthesis of GG-g-terpolymer without
ex situ addition of a third monomer. This attractive alternative pathway
for the synthesis of a new GGAMSAASP superadsorbent of alleviated
physicochemical properties is confirmed through extensive 1H NMR, FTIR, XPS, TGA, and DSC analyses. The in situ allocation of
−CO–NH–(CH2)2–COO– is established via 1H NMR, and the arrival
of the O 1s shakeup satellite band in XPS spectra is corroborated
by FTIR and thermal analyses. The grafting of GG into the AMSAASP
terpolymer is confirmed by the appearance of −CH2–O–CH2– in the FTIR and NMR studies,
supported by XRD and FESEM analyses. Relatively homogeneous distribution
of Hg(II) in the entire amide-populated GGAMSAASP14 is inter-related
to the preferential BB coordination with −COO–, along with greater surface deposition of insoluble Hg(OH)2 and HgCl2, confirmed by FTIR, DSC, TGA, and XRD studies,
with relative ease of adsorption and difficulty during desorption
of Hg(II) by the amide-populated GGAMSAASP14 because of the better
relative availability of Hg–N bonds, such as >N–Hg–N<
and −Hg–NH–, in Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14, and
envisaged from the higher k2 for Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP14
over Hg(II)–GGAMSAASP18. The binding of Hg(II) preferentially
occurs on the surface of GGAMSAASP18, without Hg(II) in the core,
generating the frequent M mode of coordination. In Hg(II)–MV
binary adsorption, manifestation of the mutual Hg(II)–MV+ interaction infers the disappearance of insoluble Hg compounds
in Hg(II)–MV–GGAMSAASPs, as evident from FTIR, TGA,
DSC, and XRD and the combined hypsochromic–hypochromic shift
in the UV–vis spectra. Altogether, owing to the rationally
optimized combination of synthetic and NPs, imparting excellent physicochemical
properties and performance characteristics in the chemisorption of
MV and/or Hg(II), GGAMSAASPs show novelty (Table S3) in a kinetically fast green waste remediation process.
This systematic design of GGAMSAASPs of excellent thermomechanical
properties can also be attempted for drug delivery, tissue engineering,
membrane-based separation, sensors, and self-healing materials. The
redemption of this study is the introduction of this new pathway,
which can also be attempted for synthesizing ASP-based terpolymers/IPNs,
without orthodox ex situ addition of ASP or derivatives of ASP.
