Herein, we present a solar-blind ultraviolet photodetector
realized
using atomic layer-deposited p-type cuprous oxide (Cu2O)
underneath a mechanically exfoliated n-type β-gallium oxide
(β-Ga2O3) nanomembrane. The atomic layer
deposition process of the Cu2O film applies bis(N,N′-di-secbutylacetamidinato)dicopper(I)
[Cu(5Bu-Me-amd)]2 as a novel Cu precursor and
water vapor as an oxidant. The exfoliated β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane was transferred to the top of the Cu2O layer surface to realize a unique oxide pn heterojunction, which
is not easy to realize by conventional oxide epitaxy techniques. The
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the fabricated pn heterojunction diode show
the typical rectifying behavior. The fabricated Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 photodetector achieves sensitive detection of
current at the picoampere scale in the reverse mode. This work provides
a new approach to integrate all oxide heterojunctions using membrane
transfer and bonding techniques, which goes beyond the limitation
of conventional heteroepitaxy.

Introduction
Solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors
have been actively
investigated recently because of their variety of potential applications
in the fields of military surveillance, biological/chemical analyses,
astronomical observations, and optical communications.1−3 Recently, photonic devices based on various materials have been
widely investigated due to their intrinsic properties, including high
transparency and excellent sensitivity.4−7 Among the oxide-based materials, especially,
cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a natural p-type semiconductor
with a bandgap of 2.1 eV8 that can be photoexcited
in the UV/visible spectral region.9 Moreover,
it exhibits unique properties such as high absorption efficiency,
non-toxicity, abundant availability, and low production costs.10−12 The atomic layer deposition (ALD) process is particularly suited
for oxide materials growth with a variety of applications in high-k
gate dielectric and highly scaled dynamic random access memory capacitor
integration because of its conformal step coverage and atomic layer
thin thickness control.13 Although many
studies of the ALD growth of metallic Cu have been reported, only
a few studies related to ALD grown Cu2O have been performed.14−16 As determined from their bandgaps, binary compound semiconductors
including GaN, SiC, and ZnO are suitable for developing visible-blind
UV detectors, which are required for higher responsivity in the UV
range compared to lower energy ranges. To meet the criteria of a solar-blind
photodetector with a cutoff wavelength below 280 nm, alloy engineering
is used to tune the bandgap as high as 4.42 eV to eliminate the longer
wavelength. For instance, AlGaN17 and MgZnO18 wide bandgap (WBG) ternary semiconductor alloys
were used to develop solar-blind photodetectors, achieving rapid progress
for the development of high-performance avalanche solar-blind photodetectors
with improved photoresponsivity and response speed. However, these
materials required a high growth temperature above 1350 °C. The
phase segregation from wurtzite to rock salt structure19 results in the degradation of detecting performance.
Alternatively, ultraWBG (UWBG) β-Ga2O3 semiconductors have been actively developed for UV-transmitting
optoelectronic applications,20−23 owing to their UWBG of 4.8–4.9 eV,24,25 the availability of large-size β-Ga2O3 bulk single crystals,26 and homoepitaxial
growth of high crystalline quality epitaxial layers with the possibility
for doping and bandgap engineering.27 In
particular, the exfoliated β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane
transfer technique offers the opportunity to demonstrate some of the
prototype device concepts, which are usually difficult to realize
using conventional material growth techniques.

Herein, we demonstrate
a heterojunction photodetector by integrating
ALD-grown p-type Cu2O with an exfoliated β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane to form a suspended pn heterojunction
structure. The ALD process can be applied for photovoltaic applications,
in particular for depositing ultrathin layers at relatively low temperatures.
We report the fabrication and characterization of a solar-blind UV
photodetector based on the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction with low dark and photonic currents for highly
sensitive photodetector applications.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
schematic illustration of the procedure used for fabricating the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 pn heterojunction photodetector
with a suspended structure. A representative fabrication process is
listed in Figure 1a.
During the first fabrication step, a Cu2O thin film was
deposited on the oxide (270 nm SiO2) of a p + Si wafer
via ALD, as shown in Figure 1b. ALD is one of the most effective oxide growth techniques
for producing ultrathin films at atomic layer accuracy. A single ALD
cycle consists of Cu deposition and oxidation, as shown in Table S1
of the Supporting Information. In this
study, bis(N,N′-di-sec-butylacetamidinato)dicopper(I) [Cu(5Bu-Me-amd)]2 was used as a novel Cu precursor. The structural formula
of the Cu precursor is presented in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. The ALD process for copper deposition
features complementarity and self-limitation related to the surface
reactions. The former feature involves two reactants for preparation
of the surface for its reaction with the other vapor, allowing the
deposition cycles to be repeated. In addition, the latter feature
contributes to the very conformable uniform thickness even on nonuniform
surface structures.28 For a stable supply,
the temperature of the canisters for the Cu precursor and H2O was maintained constant at 130 and 30 °C, respectively. In
a single thermal ALD Cu2O cycle, the optimized process
consists of a Cu-precursor pulse for 30 ms with a 100 sccm N2 flow, a purge pulse of 11 s with 100 sccm of N2 flow,
a water pulse for 60 ms with 100 sccm N2 flow, and a purge
pulse of 11 s with 100 sccm of N2 flow. During the ALD
processes, the substrate temperature was maintained at the optimized
growth temperature of 180 °C (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) and the observed growth rate was ∼0.002
nm/cycle (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). To improve the ALD growth rate and the film conductivity, plasma-enhanced
ALD process with O3 will be introduced in the near future.
In the next step, the thin β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane
was mechanically exfoliated from the bulk β-Ga2O3 substrate cleavage and transferred to the top of the Cu2O layer on the SiO2/Si substrate, as shown in Figure 1c. β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane is n-type with a Sn-doping concentration
of 2.7 × 1018 cm–3. The AZ1518 positive
photoresist (PR) with a thickness of 1.8 μm was coated on the
wafer, as shown in Figure 1d. To form two metal contacts on both the p-type Cu2O film and n-type β-Ga2O3 flake, Cu2O and SiO2 layers were etched using a 6:1 HF solution
for 60 min, as shown in Figure 1e. The PR acts as a hardmask to protect the Cu2O film underneath the PR, while Cu2O and SiO2 were etched simultaneously. As shown in Figure 1g, two 100 nm Ni electrodes were deposited
on the p-type Cu2O film and n-type β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane. Figure 1g shows an optical image of the fabricated device with
a 250 nm thick β-Ga2O3 flake including
a 12 nm Cu2O film and Ni electrodes. The contact properties
with various metals on the Cu2O film were studied and are
summarized in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information. Figure 1h,i shows
the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the fabricated device. The measured I–V curve of the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 pn heterojunction presents typical rectifying
characteristics as a well-defined diode. The on-current was limited
by both contact resistance and interface quality between the two heterogeneous
oxide materials. Although the rectifying characteristics resemble
the basic function of a pn heterojunction diode, further process optimization
is needed to reduce the surface roughness, interface quality, the
conductivity of the Cu2O film, and its contact resistance
to achieve a higher and better photosensitivity.

The composition and chemical state of the ALD-grown
Cu2O film surfaces were investigated via X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy
(XPS) with a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD instrument. This is a surface-sensitive
technique that can be used to analyze the surface chemical compositions
of deposited films, as shown in Figure 2a,b. Figure 2a shows the survey scan XPS spectrum of the as-grown Cu2O film with multiple peaks arising from Cu and O. The high-resolution
XPS spectra in the vicinity of the Cu 2p peaks showed two distinct
peaks at the binding energies of 932.2 and 951.1 eV, corresponding
to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of Cu+ (Figure 2b). Two
broad satellite peaks at 943–948 eV were also observed, both
of which were attributed to the Cu2+ state (CuO) on the
surface.29 Clear evidence of the ALD-grown
Cu2O film is shown in Figure 2c through the scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) mapping images. The high-resolution atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images of the surface morphologies of the Cu2O film
are shown in Figure 2d. The surface of the film was reasonably smooth with a roughness
of approximately 4–5 nm. Figure 2e shows the ALD-grown Cu2O thin film on
the glass substrate. As shown in Figure 2f, the Cu2O thin film with a thickness
of 12 nm exhibited a high transparency of approximately 90%, resulting
in light absorption below ∼500 nm, corresponding to an energy
of approximately 2.4 eV.30 The thickness
of the β-Ga2O3 flake was measured by AFM,
as illustrated in Figure 2g. The channel width was determined by the width of the flake
because of the stochastic nature of the β-Ga2O3 exfoliation process. Figure 2h shows the transmittance characteristics of the β-Ga2O3 bulk sample used in the fabricated device. The
inset of Figure 2h
shows the optical image of the β-Ga2O3 bulk substrate. The optical transmission characteristics of both
the Cu2O and β-Ga2O3 films
across the visible range of the spectrum is very high over 80%.30

Figure 3a shows
a schematic view of the fabricated prototype p-type Cu2O/n-type β-Ga2O3 pn heterojunction photodiode
and the time-dependent photoresponse measurement configuration. To
clearly illustrate the photoinduced electrical conduction mechanism,
the energy band diagrams of the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 pn heterojunction are provided in Figure 3b,c. The band-gap energies
of Cu2O and β-Ga2O3 are 2.1
and 4.8 eV, respectively. The valence band offset (ΔEV = 2.4 eV) and the conduction band offset (ΔEC = 0.3 eV) of the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 pn heterojunction were calculated.31 After being physically and electrically contacted,
carriers can flow until both the Fermi levels align, and a pn heterojunction
depletion layer formed near the interface of Cu2O/β-Ga2O3. As shown in Figure 3c, when UV light irradiates the fabricated
device, the light passes into the interface of the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 pn heterojunction and generates electron–hole
pairs (ehp). In the fabricated device, the β-Ga2O3 film was doped with Sn at a concentration of 2.7 × 1018 cm–3, so the separation of the photogenerated
carriers by incident light is more effective and faster due to the
larger conduction band offset.32 When a
positive (+) bias was applied to the Cu2O side, electrons
were transported toward the p-type Cu2O. Both UV light
with an intensity of 2.5 mW (λ = 390 nm) and visible light with
an intensity of 10 W (λ = 400–700 nm) were used under
the illumination of a fixed light intensity. The ION/IOFF ratios with various
applied voltages are described in Figure S5 of the Supporting Information. Figure 3d,e shows the photocurrent responses of the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 device under UV and
visible light, respectively. Four repeat on–off cycles of the
light source were used to examine the repeatability of the fabricated
device under various applied voltages (Vapp) from 5 to 20 V. Figure 3d,e shows the continuous time-dependent photoresponse characteristics
in the forward mode of the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 device under various Vapp conditions
irradiated with UV and visible light, respectively. A switching period
of 30 s was used for turning the light on and off sequentially. As
shown in Figure 3f,
the measured photocurrent drastically increases under UV light irradiation
because the photogenerated carriers are significantly limited by visible
light ranging from 400 to 700 nm.

of 10 W (λ = 400–700 nm). (f) Measured photoresponse
characteristics under both UV and visible light at Vapp = 20 V with a period of 30 s during turning the light

Figure 4a shows
the representative current–voltage characteristics under the
reverse mode of the Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 photodetector under various Vapp conditions
in the dark at room temperature (20 °C). The zero dark current
is observed at an applied bias of approximately 8 V. As in previous
measurements, when the photodetector is exposed to light, the induced
photocurrent increases rapidly. In contrast, when the light is switched
off, the light-induced photocurrent rapidly decreases. However, no
photocurrent was generated by the visible light with a longer wavelength
than that of UV light in the two cases, as shown in Figure 4b,c. The induced photocurrent
is directly attributed to the absorption of UV photons. The response
and recovery time of the fabricated device under reverse biases are
both estimated to be approximately 200 ms, as shown in Figure S6 of
the Supporting Information. These fast
response characteristics indicate that the fabricated Cu2O/β-Ga2O3 pn heterostructure is promising
for the detection of fast optical signals, with superior performance
compared to that of previously developed oxide-based photodetector
devices.5 To quantitatively assess the
device performance of the fabricated device, the responsivity (R) and detectivity (D) were calculated
as shown in Figure 4d. The R and D at an applied voltage
of −16 V were estimated to be 53 mA·W–1 and 5.2 × 1011 cm·Hz1/2/W, respectively.
In the two equations in the inset of Figure 4d, Iph and Id are the measured current under photonic and
dark states, Popt is the light intensity, A is the effective illuminated area (=8 × 10–5 cm2), and e is the electric charge (=1.6
× 10–19 C). Meanwhile, although we investigated
the characterization of a solar-blind UV photodetector using a single
wavelength of 390 nm, comprehensive studies using the light source
with a wide range of wavelengths is required for more practical applications
as a further study.

Conclusions
We have successfully developed the thermal
ALD process of p-type
Cu2O and integrated it with mechanically exfoliated n-type
β-Ga2O3 as a hybrid pn heterojunction
solar-blind UV photodetector. The p-type Cu2O film is an
important building block for all oxide-based electronic and photonic
device research. In particular, the low temperature of the ALD process
offers the unique opportunity to develop back-of-the-line transistor
technology, even for mainstream Si-based CMOS applications. Inspired
by the widely adopted two-dimensional van der Waals heterogeneous
integration, this work provides a feasible route to integrate oxide-based
pn heterojunctions for various device applications, which were previously
limited by the challenging heterogeneous epitaxy techniques.

Experimental Methods
Device Fabrication
The p-type Cu2O thin
film was deposited on 90 nm SiO2/Si substrates by the ALD
process with optimized conditions. The n-type β-Ga2O3 flakes were transferred onto the Cu2O thin
film by the exfoliation technique. Subsequently, Ni metal electrodes
were formed by electron beam evaporation and lift-off process after
photolithography patterning. The 6:1 HF solution was used not only
to etch the Cu2O film underneath the β-Ga2O3 flake but also to deposit each metal electrodes onto
the p-type Cu2O and n-type β-Ga2O3 flake, respectively.

Experimental Equipment
All electrical measurements
were carried out in an ambient air environment without any device
encapsulation. The electrical I–V characteristics were measured by using a B1500A semiconductor device
analyzer. An AFM (model Veeco Dimension 3100) analysis was also conducted
to assess the surface roughness of the atomic layer deposited Cu2O film.

TEM Analysis
To confirm the well-deposited Cu2O film layer, high-resolution TEM (FEI TALOS F200X operated at 200
kV) equipped with high angle annular dark field detectors and super
X electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was carried out.

XPS Analysis
The chemical composition of the Cu2O film was investigated using the XPS system (Kratos Axis
Ultra DLD) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV).

Transmittance Measurement
The transmittance of Cu2O, β-Ga2O3, and the glass substrate
was evaluated using Filmetrics F20 with a wavelength range from 380
to 1050 nm.
