Conformational
isomers are stereoisomers that can interconvert
over low potential barriers by rotation around a single bond. However,
such bond rotation is hampered by geometrical constraints when molecules
are adsorbed on surfaces. Here, we show that the adsorption of 4,4′-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)-6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine
molecules on surfaces leads to the appearance of prochiral single
molecules on NiO(001) and to enantiopure supramolecular domains on
Au(111) surfaces containing the transoid-molecule conformation. Upon
additional Fe adatom deposition, molecules undergo a controlled interconversion
from a transoid-to-cisoid conformation as a result of coordination
of the Fe atoms to the 2,2′-bipyridine moieties. As confirmed
by atomic force microscopy images and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
measurements, the resulting molecular structures become irreversibly
achiral.

Introduction
An enantiomer is “one of a pair
of molecular entities which
are mirror images of each other and non-superposable”.1 Atropisomerism is a particular class of axial
enantiomerism which results from hindered rotation about a single
bond. In such compounds, enantiomer interconversions are mediated
only by bond rotations between isomers (in contrast to interconversions
that involve covalent bond breaking). Thus, the stability of “long-lived”
atropisomers in three dimensions usually requires steric hindrance
in order to constrain internal bond rotations using peripheral chemical
substitutions. To impose chirality, another approach consists in the
confinement of molecules onto a crystalline surface. Over the last
couple of decades, this strategy has enabled the formation of enantiopure
self-assemblies2,3 or chiral molecular compounds
from on-surface chemical reactions.4,5 Accessing chiral
molecular surfaces further allows a vast range of novel properties
to emerge including the amplification of nonlinear optical properties6,7 and the asymmetric scattering of spin-polarized electrons.8 Moreover, the control of chiral–achiral
transitions in surface-stabilized molecular networks could also help
designing chirality sensors, molecular switches, and motors.9−11 If a good alternative for stabilizing relies in their geometrical
frustration on a surface,12,13 a step further would
be to control the bond rotation and thus the molecule conformation.

In this work, we investigate the adsorption of achiral 4,4′-di(4-carboxyphenyl)-6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine
(DCPDMbpy) molecules by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
on NiO(001) and Au(111). Our work is motivated by our recent hierarchical
assembly strategy “surfaces-as-ligands surfaces-as-complexes”
approach14 focusing on designing novel
molecular compounds having (i) anchoring groups such as carboxylic
or phosphonic acids that enable a strong anchoring of the molecule
to surfaces and (ii) metal-binding moieties such as 2,2′-bipyridine
(bpy) to facilitate the assembly of surface-bound metal coordination
compounds either through sequential addition of metal ions and an
ancillary ligand or through a ligand–exchange reaction between
the anchoring ligand and a homoleptic metal complex.14−17

In a previous work, we investigated the first step of the
DCPDMbpy
assembly process using AFM operated in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions.18 We showed that the DCPDMbpy molecule systematically
adopts two prochiral transoid conformations (α and β, Figure 1a) when adsorbed
onto an atomically clean NiO(001) crystal surface. In contrast, the
cisoid conformation was not observed even upon annealing up to 420
K close to the desorption temperature of the molecule. This can be
explained by the high energy barrier needed to be overcome in order
to induce a bond rotation about the interannular C–C bond as
well as the energy to partially desorb the molecule from the surface
to allow the rotation.

Figure 1 Transoid and cisoid conformations of the DCPDMbpy and
Fe–DCPDMbpy
molecules. Upon adsorption, the DCPDMbpy adopts two prochiral conformations
α and β. Upon coordination with Fe, the molecule can undergo
a conformational change to the cisoid conformation.

Theoretical studies of the conformational change
from transoid
to cisoid for a bpy in the gas phase have estimated an energy of about
320 meV (31 kJ·mol–1).19,20 The high rotational barrier was found to arise from the electrostatic
repulsion between the lone pairs of the bipyridine units.21 This repulsive interaction also leads to the
transoid conformation in favor of the cisoid one in gas phase as well
as during its adsorption on surfaces. Note that this barrier is much
higher than the available thermal energy at room temperature (RT)
or even upon surface annealing (i.e., at 1000 K, the available energy
is about 80 meV (8 kJ·mol–1), which implies
that the molecule desorbs before changing its conformation to the
cisoid one). However, the activation energy to promote the conformational
change can be overcome when forming a complex between a metal atom
and a bpy unit, theoretically delivering about 4.66 eV (450 kJ·mol–1).22,23 Metal coordination might thus
enable the emergence of the cisoid form on surfaces.

Here, we
investigated DCPDMbpy molecules in the presence of metallic
adatoms on both NiO(001) and Au(111) surfaces. The achiral cisoid
geometry is observed after adsorption of prochiral DCPDMbpy on a NiO(001)
surface previously partially covered with Fe atoms, demonstrating
the Fe–DCPDMbpy complex formation through coordination between
Fe atoms and bpy moieties. Furthermore, upon Fe adatom deposition
on prochiral DCPDMbpy assemblies formed on Au(111), the molecules
undergo an interconversion from transoid to cisoid on the surface,
which is triggered by the same metal-coordination mechanism as shown
by AFM images and XPS measurements.

Results and Discussion
Conformations
of the DCPDMbpy and Fe–DCPDMbpy Molecules
on NiO(001) at RT
To demonstrate the control of such chiral–achiral
transitions on surfaces, we first investigated DCPDMbpy molecules
on a NiO(001) substrate. Figure 2a shows a representative AFM topographic image of the
NiO(001) surface after deposition of 0.2 monolayer (ML) of DCPDMbpy
at RT. In the following, we define a ML as one layer of molecules
fully covering the surface, 0.2 ML corresponds to a surface coverage
of 20%. Large terraces are separated by mono-atomic steps and are
covered with single molecules as well as molecular aggregates. The
step edges are saturated on both upper and lower sides, indicating
that these are preferential adsorption sites. The relatively short
distance between the molecules (3.9 ± 0.7 nm in average) suggests
a relatively low diffusion of the molecules at RT on the NiO(001)
surface and, therefore, a rather strong binding to the substrate.
Upon surface annealing, the diffusion remains low as discussed previously,18 where molecular diffusion as a function of the
substrate annealing temperature was studied.

(e,f) Corresponding Δf images acquired with
the second scanning pass, that is, with open feedback, using offsets
of ∼−350 and −280 pm. The molecules are in transoid
and cisoid conformation, respectively. (g,h) Structural models of
both DCPDMbpy geometries on NiO(001).

In order to trigger the emergence of metal complexes, 0.1
ML of
Fe atoms was deposited at RT on the bare surface of NiO. DCPDMbpy
molecules were then subsequently adsorbed onto this surface. To favor
the coordination complex formation, the sample was annealed to 420
K after sublimation of molecules. Figure 2b shows an AFM topographic image of this
surface. To unambiguously confirm the DCPDMbpy–Fe complex formation
on NiO(001), we focused on imaging of the molecule conformations at
RT using a silicon cantilever (see Methods), employing the multipass technique24 which has proven to deliver submolecular resolution at RT.18,25 The method consists of recording a first line scan with a closed
feedback loop at a relative tip–sample distance Z1st regulated for a particular set-point Δf1 and acquiring a second pass along the same
scan line with the feedback open and at a closer tip–sample
distance Z2nd = Z1st – Zoff (Zoff is in the order of 200–400 pm).

Figure 2c,d shows
such AFM images of the DCPDMbpy molecules on NiO(001) without and
with Fe atoms, respectively. The two AFM images acquired during the
first scan suggest that both molecules are lying flat on the surface
(∼0.2 nm in height) but the lack of resolution does not allow
us to unambiguously assign a conformation. In the second pass, the
molecules are better resolved (Figure 2e,f) and a clear distinction between the transoid and
cisoid conformations of both molecules is observed as illustrated
in Figure 2g,h. Upon
adsorption and without Fe atoms, the DCPDMbpy molecules are adsorbed
in the prochiral transoid conformation, whereas successive deposition
of Fe and molecules results in the formation of the Fe–DCPDM(bpy)
units possessing the cisoid conformation within the bpy units. Although
the adoption of the cisoid conformation is due to the coordination
to a metal center, we cannot clearly confirm its presence by AFM imaging.
Metal atoms are generally difficult to observe by AFM in metal–ligand
complexes at surfaces.26−30

Structure Resolution by Low-Temperature AFM with CO-Terminated
Tips
To further improve the resolution, we measured the DCPDMbpy
molecules on Au(111) at 4.7 K using AFM with a CO-terminated tip.31 Compared to the NiO(001) samples, Au(111) surfaces
were prepared with similar molecule and Fe atom coverages (see Methods). Figure 3a,b shows STM topographies of both DCPDMbpy conformations
and the corresponding constant-height AFM image acquired with a CO-terminated
tip at 4.7 K. The transoid and cisoid conformations are unambiguously
observed, and a clear distinction of the phenyl rings of the molecules
as well as the methyl groups attached to the bpy units again confirms
that the molecules lie flat on the surface (see qualitative models
in Figure 3c). For
the cisoid conformation, the Fe atom bound to the bpy moieties is
again not visible in the image. This observation, in addition to the
fact that the methyl groups of the Fe–DCPDMbpy appear with
a brighter contrast in comparison to transoid–DCPDMbpy, suggest
that the Fe atom is hidden under the molecule with the result that
the latter undergoes a slight bending (Figure 3c).

0 V).

The diffusion of the DCPDMbpy
on Au(111) in comparison to what
is observed on NiO(001) plays an important role. Indeed, in contrast
to NiO, large DCPDMbpy self-assemblies can be formed at the gold surface
at RT even at low coverages (≤0.2 ML) as shown in Figure 3d. In other words,
the diffusion of each product of the reaction and consequently also
the formation of supramolecular structures can be hindered or facilitated
as a function of the host substrate. On Au(111), two enantiopure domains
denoted 1 and 2 coexist as a direct consequence of the prochirality
of the DCPDMbpy molecule. As shown in the AFM image and highlighted
by green lines in the structural model of Figure 3e, the self-assembly process is governed
by hydrogen bonding between carboxylic groups of adjacent enantiomers
and forms extended close-packed molecular domains. The additional
deposition of Fe atoms onto these chiral molecular domains on Au(111)
leads to the formation of extended chainlike structures (Figures 3f and 4d). By interacting with the lone pairs of the bipyridine unit,
the Fe atom in the Fe–DCPDMbpy complex imposes the cisoid conformation.
This conformation is achiral on the surface and, thus, induces the
loss of chirality of the molecular domains.

In analogy to the self-assembly of transoid molecules,
the assembly
of cisoid Fe–DCPDMbpy complex is driven by hydrogen bonding
between their carboxylic groups (O–H···O) leading
to the formation of chainlike assemblies (Figures 3f and 4d) as well
as trimers (Figure 3g). Note that the coordination of more than one DCPDMbpy ligand to
Fe was never observed on the surface. We attribute this to the steric
hindrance that would occur between the 6,6′-dimethyl groups
of adjacent DCPDMbpy ligands in a Fe(DCPDMbpy)2 species
that was constrained to a planar conformation on a surface.

XPS Study
of the Complex on Au(111)
To investigate
the role of Fe adatoms in the assembly process, we further investigated
by XPS the N1s binding energies (BE) of the DCPDMbpy molecules on
Au(111) to reveal the chemical environment of the bpy moieties. The
samples were prepared at RT with a coverage ≤1 ML in the preparation
chamber of the LT microscope and then transferred using a UHV-vacuum
suitcase to the XPS chamber for analysis (see Methods). For this specific coverage, the N 1s BE is at 398.2 eV (green
curve in Figure 4a),
which corresponds to supramolecular networks of the transoid molecules
(Figure 4b). Upon complex
formation obtained by additionally depositing Fe adatoms (blue curve
in Figure 4a), the
N 1s BE significantly shifts by 1 eV to higher values (BE = 399.2
eV) supporting the expected Fe complex formation and with this also
the switch to cisoid conformation. In that case, the lone pair of
the N atoms of the bpy preferentially interacts with an Fe adatom,32,33 inducing a new chemical environment for the nitrogens (N···Fe···N).
After annealing of the surface covered with DCPDM(bpy) molecules at
400 K (without Fe deposition), the N 1s BE shifts slightly by 0.2
eV. According to the STM image (Figure 4c), the shift originates from a fraction of DCPDMbpy
molecules that have formed a complex with specific sites of the gold
surface such as step edges, defects, and elbows of the reconstruction
(black arrows in Figure 4c).28 Although two peaks are expected
here, the first arising from the transoid–DCPDMbpy molecules
and the second from the Au–DCPDMbpy coordination complexes
(N···Au···N), the small amount of molecules
(<1 ML), for example low signal-to-noise ratio, do not allow a
proper deconvolution of the N 1s peaks, and hence, only one peak is
observed. Moreover, the complex formation reaction only triggered
by temperature without additional metal atoms is less efficient as
it is restricted to specific locations of the Au(111) surface.

Table 1 summarizes
the DCPDMbpy conformation ratio as a function of the sample preparations
at a coverage ≤0.1 ML adsorbed on Au(111). This ratio could
be determined through analysis of a set of high resolution STM images.
Upon deposition at RT, almost all the DCPDMbpy molecules adsorbed
on the Au(111) surface are in transoid conformation and the ratio
transoid/cisoid is measured to be ∼91:9. Upon Fe deposition
and surface annealing, this ratio changes to 3:97, demonstrating a
high specificity for the complex formation. When only triggered by
temperature, the ratio becomes ∼52:48 but might be increased
for higher molecule coverages as it will allow the saturation of the
Au(111) reactive sites. It is also worth mentioning that metallic
surfaces are known for their catalytic character in contrast to other
surfaces. In a previous investigation, the study of the temperature
effect on the DCPDMbpy assembly on NiO(001)18 demonstrated that molecules are not affected by annealing and remain
in transoid conformation up to 493 K when they tend to desorb. In
principle, the process is thus independent of the underlying surface
as soon as metal adatoms are present as demonstrated on both Au(111)
and NiO(001) surfaces. As shown in our work, the diffusion and local
reactive sites of the surfaces, however, influence the complex reaction
and other metals might also form complexes. Finally, we emphasize
the irreversible character of this prochiral to achiral transition
in single molecules as well as in supramolecular networks because
the opposite change, from cisoid to transoid, could not be experimentally
achieved. Our results thus show the formation and suppression of surface-induced
prochirality from the single molecule scale to the supramolecular
network level.

Conclusions
In
summary, the DCPDMbpy molecule is adsorbed in a transoid geometry
on both NiO(001) and Au(111) as single molecules and enantiopure domains,
respectively. When adsorbed on NiO(001) partially covered with Fe
adatoms, the molecule shows a cisoid conformation demonstrating the
formation of a metal-coordination complex (Fe–DCPDMbpy). On
Au(111), we showed that the molecules undergo the interconversion
from transoid to cisoid upon Fe adatom deposition on previously formed
enantiopure DCPDMbpy assemblies. Using AFM imaging and XPS measurements,
we demonstrated that the process is triggered by coordination complex
formation between Fe atoms and the bpy moieties of the molecule. Interestingly,
the new Fe–DCPDMbpy supramolecular networks on gold are achiral,
which demonstrates the suppression of a surface-induced chirality
in thin supramolecular networks via metal complex formation.

Molecule
Synthesis
DCPDMbpy was synthesized by Dr.
Davood Zare (University of Basel) following the reported procedure.34

Sample Preparation
The NiO(001)
crystals used in this
study, purchased from SurfaceNet, consist of rectangular rods with
dimensions 2 × 2 × 7 mm3 and a long axis in the
[001] direction. The NiO(001) surface was prepared through in situ
cleavage (UHV, p < 1 × 10–10 mbar) with prior and subsequent annealing at about 800 K resulting
in an atomically clean surface. An Au(111) single crystal, purchased
from Mateck GmbH, was cleaned by several sputtering and annealing
cycles in UHV conditions. DCPDMbpy molecules were thermally evaporated
from a Knudsen cell heated up to 528 K on the surfaces kept at RT.
The molecule rate was checked in situ using a quartz microbalance.
Fe adatom depositions were conducted using an e-beam evaporator. To
promote complex formation, the sample was then annealed to 420 K during
molecule and atom evaporation. For NiO(001), because of the low diffusion
rate, we first sublimated the Fe atoms and then DCPDMbpy molecules.
For Au(111), the steps of the procedure were inverted: molecules were
deposited first and Fe atoms afterward. A vacuum suitcase from Ferrovac
GmbH was employed to transfer samples from the UHV LT AFM/STM setup
to the XPS chamber.

AFM Imaging at RT
AFM measurements
on NiO were conducted
with a home built AFM system in UHV operated at RT. All AFM images
were recorded in the non-contact mode (nc-AFM), using a silicon cantilever
(Nanosensors PPP-NCR stiffness k = 20–30 N/m,
resonance frequency f1 around 165 kHz,
and Q1 factor around 30 000 with
compensated contact potential difference).

STM/AFM Imaging at Low
Temperature
STM/AFM experiments
were carried out at 4.7 K with an Omicron GmbH low-temperature STM/AFM
system operated with a Nanonis RC5 electronics. We used commercial
tuning fork sensors in the qPlus configuration (f1 = 26 kHz, Q = 10 000–25 000,
nominal spring constant k = 1800 N m–1). The constant-height AFM images were acquired with CO-terminated
tips. All voltages refer to the sample bias with respect to the tip.

XPS Measurements
The samples were transferred in situ
using a vacuum suitcase to the XPS chamber directly after molecules
and Fe atom deposition. The pressure in the XPS chamber was always
≤10–10 mbar, and measurements were performed
using a VG ESCALAB 210 system equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source. A pass energy of 20 eV was used for
all narrow scan measurements and 100 eV pass energy for survey scans.
Normal electron escape angle and a step size of 0.05 eV were used.
The energy positions of the spectra were calibrated with reference
to the 4f 7/2 level of a clean gold sample at 84.0 eV binding energy.
XPS fitting was performed with Unifit 2016 Software.35
