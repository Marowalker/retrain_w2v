DbpA
is an Escherichia coli DEAD-box
RNA helicase implicated in RNA structural isomerization in the peptide
bond formation site. In addition to the RecA-like catalytic core conserved
in all of the members of DEAD-box family, DbpA contains a structured
C-terminal domain, which is responsible for anchoring DbpA to hairpin
92 of 23S ribosomal RNA during the ribosome assembly process. Here,
surface plasmon resonance was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation
constant and the microscopic rate constants of the DbpA C-terminal
domain association and dissociation to a fragment of 23S ribosomal
RNA containing hairpin 92. Our results show that the DbpA protein’s
residence time on the RNA is 10 times longer than the time DbpA requires
to hydrolyze one ATP. Thus, our data suggest that once bound to the
intermediate ribosomal particles via its RNA-binding domain, DbpA
could unwind a number of double-helix substrates before its dissociation
from the ribosomal particles.

Introduction
DbpA is an Escherichia
coli DEAD-box
RNA helicase implicated in RNA structural rearrangement in the peptide
bond formation site.1,2 Like all of the members of the
DEAD-box family of enzymes, DbpA contains a RecA-like catalytic core,
which is the workhorse of the protein.3−5 The DbpA catalytic core
uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to unwind short double-helix
RNA substrates in a sequence nonspecific manner.2

Structural data obtained with many members of DEAD-box
proteins
in complex with RNA, and biochemical data obtained with DbpA and its
ortholog in Bacillis subtillis, YxiN,
suggest that the ATP binding to the DbpA catalytic core promotes its
loading onto one of the strands of the double-helix substrate.6−10 Next, ATP is hydrolyzed and the RNA strand, complementary to the
double-helix strand to which the DbpA catalytic core was loaded on,
is released.11 Inorganic phosphate release
produces the release of the second RNA strand.11 Finally, ADP release regenerates the enzyme.11 Similar to many other members of the DEAD-box
family of enzymes, DbpA hydrolyses one ATP molecule for every short
double-helix unwinding event.11−13 Moreover, the interaction of
a single-stranded RNA region with the catalytic core of DbpA is sufficient
to stimulate DbpA ATPase activity.1,14

In addition
to the catalytic core, DbpA contains a structured C-terminal
domain.15−19 This domain is an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and it imparts specific
and tight binding of DbpA to hairpin 92 of 23S ribosomal RNA.15−17,19 The function of the RNA-binding
domain of YxiN/DbpA and its catalytic core are completely autonomous.17,20 More importantly, our recent study demonstrates that the DbpA catalytic
core could unwind any double-helix substrate within its grasp,20 suggesting that during ribosome assembly, once
the DbpA protein is bound to hairpin 92 via its RNA-binding domain,
the catalytic core could unwind double-helices placed at different
regions of the ribosomal particle. Experiments performed with the
helicase inactive DbpA construct, R331A, seem to support this hypothesis.21

When the helicase inactive DbpA construct,
R331A, is expressed
in E. coli cells, three large subunit
intermediate particles accumulate with sedimentation coefficients
of 27S, 35S, and 45S.21,22 The protein composition of the
45S particle is known from the quantitative mass spectrometry.21 In the 45S particle, six late-stage ribosomal
subunit proteins are less abundant and one is completely missing.
The less abundant proteins are positioned in different regions of
the large ribosomal subunit, suggesting that DbpA may perform RNA
structural rearrangement in more than one area of the ribosomal particle.21 The modeling data of DbpA’s interaction
with the correctly assembled 50S subunit also suggested that DbpA
could act on many regions of the ribosome and distant from helix 92.19 The question remains: does the DbpA protein
leave the ribosomal particle after each unwinding event, and then
returns to unwind another double-helix, or does DbpA bind to hairpin
92 via its C-terminal RNA-binding domain and unwinds a number of double-helices
before the C-terminal domain dissociates from the ribosomal RNA? The
experiments outlined here aim to determine the residence time of the
DbpA C-terminal domain on RNA and compare it to the time required
by the DbpA catalytic core to hydrolyze one ATP molecule and release
ADP. The knowledge of the residence time of DbpA on RNA is important
for a complete understanding of the mechanism DbpA employs to perform
RNA structural rearrangements during ribosome assembly.

Results
Kinetics of
DbpA Binding to RNA
The goal of these experiments
was to determine the kinetics of association and dissociation of DbpA
to the cognate RNA shown in Figure 1A. Model molecules similar to the one shown in Figure 1A, have been used
by our laboratory and other laboratories to measure the DbpA–RNA
interaction.2,23−25 Extensive amounts
of previous data from other laboratories have shown that in the absence
of ATP, the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of DbpA is the only domain
of DbpA interacting with RNA.6,15−17 Thus, under our experimental conditions, in the absence of ATP,
we are measuring the association and dissociation of the DbpA C-terminal
domain to RNA. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to measure
the kinetics of association and dissociation and the equilibrium constant
of DbpA to the RNA molecule shown in Figure 1A. Figure 1B shows the model RNA molecule used in the reference
flow cell of the SPR experiment. DbpA has a low, nonspecific affinity
for RNA molecules missing hairpin 92.14,26 Therefore,
the sensogram differences between the sample flow cell and the reference
flow cell allow us to examine the specific interaction of DbpA with
its cognate RNA separated from the nonspecific DbpA–RNA interactions
(Figure 1A).

Figure 1 SPR kinetic
data. (A) RNA molecule immobilized on the sample cell.
The RNA molecule immobilized on the sample cell contains hairpin and
helix 92 of the 23S rRNA. Hairpin and helix 92 are required for tight
and specific binding of DbpA to RNA. (B) RNA molecule immobilized
on the reference cell. (C) Representative adjusted sensograms of nine
different protein concentrations showing kinetics of association and
dissociation of the DbpA protein to the 42-mer RNA (A). The adjusted
sensograms were obtained by subtracting the signal obtained from the
experimental cell from the signal obtained from the reference cell.
The continuous lines represent global fits of the data collected at
the given protein concentration. DbpA–RNA association was monitored
for 180 s, whereas DbpA–RNA dissociation was monitored for
360 s.

For the SPR experiments described
here, the RNA molecules were
chosen as the ligand because in an SPR experiment the signal is proportional
to the change in the molecular mass of the ligand–analyte complex.27 Consequently, the change in signal is expected
to be much larger when the lower-molecular-mass 42-mer RNA (14.5 kDa)
is attached to the chip surface and the higher-molecular-mass DbpA
(55 kDa) serves as the analyte.

Figure 1C is an
example of the differences in adjusted sensograms obtained at various
DbpA concentrations in the presence of 50 mM KCl. The sensograms consists
of three phases: the association phase, during which DbpA is flowed
across the chip and there is an increase in the response units over
time as the DbpA–RNA complex forms; the equilibrium or steady-state
phase, during which the response units do not change; and the dissociation
phase, during which the DbpA is removed from the flow cell.

By performing a mathematical global fit of the SPR data and using
the 1:1 binding model (Materials and Methods, eqs 1–4) we obtained the microscopic rate constant of association
(ka), the microscopic rate constant of
dissociation (kd), and equilibrium dissociation
constant (KD) of DbpA cognate RNA interaction
at 50 mM KCl. From these fits, the ka =
(1.4 ± 0.2) × 106 M–1 s–1, and the kd = (8.0 ±
0.4) × 10–2 s–1. The KD obtained from the ratio of kd to ka is 56.9 ± 0.2
nM, whereas the KD obtained from the steady-state
binding levels dependence on the DbpA concentrations is 60.3 ±
0.4 nM. Hence, the KD values obtained
from the ratios of the microscopic rate constants and the equilibrium,
steady-state binding levels are similar.

The detection limit
for ka measurement
with the Biacore X100 is 1.0 × 107 M–1 s–1, whereas the detection limit for kd measurement is 0.1 s–1. At KCl concentrations
lower than 50 mM, ka increases to values
higher than 1.0 × 107 M–1 s–1, and at KCl concentrations higher than 50 mM, the kd increases to values larger than 0.1 s–1. Hence, we were only able to accurately measure ka and kd using a
KCl concentration of 50 mM. The increase in ka values observed at KCl concentrations lower than 50 mM suggests
that long-range electrostatic interactions drive the recognition of
RNA by DbpA. The lower monovalent salt concentration promotes a faster
RNA–DbpA complex formation. The increase in kd for KCl concentrations higher than 50 mM KCl suggest
that electrostatic interactions, which become weaker at higher monovalent
concentration, play a role in the stability of the DbpA–RNA
complex. Thus, in addition to facilitating the recognition of RNA
by DbpA, electrostatic interactions may also promote the stability
of the DbpA–RNA complex. The role of electrostatic interactions
in promoting both the recognition of the RNA by protein and the stability
of protein–RNA complex has been previously demonstrated for
the N-terminal domain of U1A spliceosomal protein interaction with
its cognate RNA. Similar to DbpA’s C-terminal domain, the N-terminal
domain of U1A is an RRM.28

Kinetics and
Equilibrium of ATPase Activity of DbpA
The activation of
ATP hydrolysis by DbpA in the presence of various
ATP concentrations and 2 μM of RNA was measured by using the
pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay as explained in Materials and Methods section of the article.29 The RNA molecule used in this experiment is
shown in Figure 1A.
The pyruvate kinase lactate/dehydrogenase-coupled assay measures the
amount of ADP formed as a consequence of ATP hydrolysis by DbpA. Figure 2 shows the dependence
of the ATP hydrolyzed by DbpA on the ATP concentration. The Michaelis–Menten
equation was used to fit the data in Figure 2. From the data fit, the Michaelis–Menten
binding constant (Km) and the ATP turnover
number (kcat) were obtained. The Km of ATP–DbpA interaction is (6 ±
3) × 102 μM, and the kcat is 1.0 ± 0.2 s–1.

Figure 2 Activation of DbpA’s
ATPase activity. The RNA molecule used
for these experiments is the molecule shown in Figure 1A. The Michaelis–Menten formalism
was used to fit the data. The program used to fit the data is KaleidaGraph.
The data are a representative of a single independent experiment.
From these data, the ATP Michaelis–Menten binding constant
(Km) and the ATP turnover number (kcat) were obtained. The average values and standard
deviation for Km and kcat calculated from four independent experiments are shown
in Table 1.

kcat is an observed
rate constant and
consists of many microscopic rate constants. The precise relationship
between kcat and other microscopic rate
constants for DbpA was described by De La Cruz’s group.30 Although here we have not determined the precise
microscopic rate constants that make up kcat, kcat cannot be faster than the rate-limiting
step of DbpA catalytic cycle. Thus, the kcat value determined here produces information on the slowest step of
DbpA catalytic cycle. The kcat value of
DbpA is tenfold higher than the residence time of DbpA in RNA (kd, Table 1); hence, DbpA, once bound to
hairpin 92, performs multiple catalytic cycles before its departure.

Discussion
The experiments carried
out in this work investigate the microscopic
rate constant of association and dissociation of the DbpA RNA-binding
domain to its cognate RNA. The microscopic rate constant of the DbpA
RNA-binding domain dissociating from its cognate RNA is tenfold lower
than the observed microscopic rate constant of ATP hydrolysis by the
DbpA catalytic core and release of the ADP molecule. The ADP release
is the final step of the DbpA catalytic cycle.11 Hence, these data combined with our previous studies on
region specificity of DbpA20 and De La
Cruz’s group studies, which demonstrated that the hydrolysis
of one ATP molecule by DbpA is sufficient to unwind a short double-helix,11 suggest that when the DbpA protein binds to
hairpin 92 during ribosome assembly, it could unwind many double-helices
in various regions of the ribosomal particle before it dissociates
from this hairpin.

In vitro experiments with a model substrate
have shown that not
every DbpA ATP hydrolysis cycle produces an unwinding event; in other
words, DbpA ATP futile cycles are observed.30 The number of DbpA’s futile ATP cycles increases with an
increase in the number of bases in the double-helix, which suggests
that the futile ATP cycling is a consequence of the reannealing of
partially unwound RNA double-helices.30 The long residence time of the C-terminal RNA-binding domain on
the ribosomal particle could also give the catalytic core a chance
to unwind the double-helices that the catalytic core was unable to
unwind during its futile ATP cycles.

Anisotropy experiments
performed by De La Cruz’s group showed
the residence time of DbpA on the RNA strand containing hairpin 92
was longer than the time required for the DbpA catalytic core to unwind
a short RNA helix.11 Hence, our data agree
with De La Cruz’s group’s conclusions.

Klostermeier’s
group demonstrated that the binding of RNA
and ATP to YxiN catalytic core is a cooperative process.31 The single-molecule FRET dyes for these experiments
were placed on the catalytic core of YxiN. Thus, these experiments
probed only the movement of the two catalytic core RecA-like domains31 and produced no information on the role of ATP
binding on YxiN RNA-binding domain affinity for RNA.31

The diagram in Figure 3 describes the interaction of the DbpA RNA-binding
domain
with RNA and the catalytic cycle of DbpA. Our experiments20 and experiments performed by Uhlenbeck and McKay
groups16,17 have demonstrated that the functions of
the RNA-binding domain and the catalytic core of DbpA/YxiN are separated.
Moreover, Klostermeier and Uhlenbeck groups’ experiments have
shown that DbpA/YxiN catalytic core interacts with RNA only in the
presence of ATP.6,16,31 Thus, the kd and ka values measured in the absence of ATP describe the interaction
of RNA-binding domain with RNA separated from the interaction of the
catalytic core with RNA.

Figure 3 Diagram of DbpA catalytic cycle. Helix 92 where
DbpA binds via
its RNA-binding domain is shown in black, the RNA-binding domain is
shown in dark green and the RecA-like catalytic core is shown in tan.
ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate are shown in purple, red, and bright
green, respectively. The catalytic core of DbpA/YxiN does not interact
with RNA in the absence of ATP.6,16,31 On the other hand, the DbpA/YxiN RNA-binding domain interacts tightly
and specifically with DbpA in the absence of ATP.16,17,19 ATP binding has been shown to promote the
interaction of DbpA/YxiN catalytic core with RNA.6,11,16 Subsequent ATP hydrolysis and release of
inorganic phosphate has shown to promote the release of the RNA strand
bound to DbpA catalytic core.11 Finally,
the release of ADP regenerates the enzyme.11 Because the residence time of DbpA RNA-binding domain is about 10
times longer than the turnover rate of ATP hydrolysis by DbpA, the
catalytic cycle of DbpA could be repeated many times before the DbpA
RNA-binding domain leaves the RNA. In our diagram, the RNA-binding
domain of DbpA interacts with the single-stranded RNA region 5′
of helix 92. This interaction was suggested from crystallographic
studies.19

In the presence of AMPPNP, the catalytic core of DbpA/YxiN
is stuck
with RNA in its catalytic jaws.16,32,33 This long residence time of DbpA/YxiN catalytic core is not part
of DbpA/YxiN normal catalytic cycle. Hence, we believe that the kd and ka measurements
in the presence of AMPPNP would not produce useful information about
DbpA protein’s residence time on RNA. In E.
coli, under nonstress conditions, there are 60−150
mM K+, 2–5 mM of free Mg2+, and 2 mM
of polyamines present.34 Our measurements
of ka, kd,
and kcat were performed in the presence
of 5 mM MgCl2 and 75.9 mM K+ (50 mM from KCl
added to the reaction and 25.9 mM K+ from the HEPES–KOH
buffer); hence, our experiments were performed within the boundaries
of ionic cellular conditions.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and RNA Molecules
All of the chemicals were
purchased from Fisher Scientific. The RNA constructs were purchased
high-performance liquid chromatography-purified from Integrated DNA
Technologies. The streptavidin-coated chips were purchased from GE
Healthcare Life Sciences. Pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzyme
mixture was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

DbpA Expression and Purification
DbpA was expressed
and purified as previously described.21 In brief, the DbpA protein bearing a six-histidine N-terminal tag
was purified using affinity chromatography followed by gel-filtration
chromatography. The histidine tag was not removed from the protein
during the purification process.21

Surface
Plasmon Resonance
Figure 1 shows the RNA molecules used for the SPR
experiments. Both molecules were chemically synthesized with a biotin
molecule at the 5′ end. The DbpA cognate RNA (Figure 1A) was immobilized via the
biotin–streptavidin interaction in the sample cell, whereas
the linear RNA (Figure 1B) was immobilized via biotin–streptavidin interaction in
the reference cell. To ensure that hairpin 92 was correctly formed,
DbpA’s cognate RNA was heated to 95 °C in the presence
of 50 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5 and 50 mM KCl and kept at 95 °C
for 1 min. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled down to 65
°C and kept at that temperature for 3 min, and then cooled down
again to 22 °C. Next, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration
of 10 mM and the RNA sample was incubated at 22 °C for 15 min.
This annealing protocol has been used previously to anneal the model
RNA containing hairpin 92.21,25 Although the reference
cell’s linear RNA is not predicted to form a secondary structure,
to ensure that both RNA molecules were treated the same way, this
RNA molecule was also taken through the annealing process described
above.

The unconjugated streptavidin was removed from the chips’
surface by three injections of a solution containing 1 M NaCl and
50 mM NaOH at 30 μL min–1, as suggested by
the GE Healthcare Life Sciences. Before injection into the flow cells,
RNA samples were diluted 200-fold in SPR running buffer, which consisted
of 50 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol,
0.5% Tween-20, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and various concentrations
of KCl. The DbpA protein’s storage buffer was exchanged with
the SPR running buffer using Microcon MWCO 10 kDa centrifugal filters
(Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). The extinction coefficient
of 26 970 M–1 cm–1 at 280
nM was used to determine the DbpA protein’s concentration.

The equilibrium and kinetics of DbpA–RNA complex formation
were investigated using a Biacore X100. The RNA was immobilized to
50 or 250 response units (RU), which corresponds to an RNA concentration
of 34.5–172.4 μM.35 However,
the volume of the matrix is only about 120 pL, and a concentration
of 34.5–172.4 μM correspond to 4–20 femtomoles
of molecules in the matrix. The flow rate used for RNA immobilization
and the protein−RNA binding experiments was 30 μL min–1. All of the experiments were carried out at 22 °C.
The measurements were performed by the addition of several concentrations
of DbpA for 180 s, and the complex dissociation was monitored for
360 s.

The resulting sensograms for the reference and the experimental
flow cell were zeroed on the x axis to mark the beginning
of injection with respect to each other. To correctly determine the
differences in response between the reference and the experimental
cell, prior to DbpA injection, sensograms were also zeroed on the y axis.27,36

To determine the DbpA association
and dissociation rate constants
to RNA, the equations below (eqs 1–4) were employed to simultaneously
fit the response. BIAevaluation software (version 4.1) was used for
these fits. 1   2   3   4  [RNA] is the concentration of free RNA. [DbpA]
is the concentration of DbpA, the analyte, [RNA–DbpA] is the
concentration of the RNA–DbpA complex, and R is the response in response units (RU). The fits assume that at
the maximum response no free ligand, RNA, is present and the total
response depends on the concentration of DbpA–RNA complex plus
the initial response before the DbpA was added.

The binding
affinity of DbpA for RNA was calculated by two methods.
The first method involved calculating the ratio of kd to ka. The second method
involved using eq 5 to
fit the equilibrium response units versus the protein concentration.
The equilibrium response units were obtained from the points on the
equilibrium region of the sensogram. 5  In eq 5, Requ is the sensogram response
at the equilibrium, the Rmax is the maximum
response, and KD is the dissociation constant.
BIAevaluation software (version 4.1) was used to fit the sensogram
data and calculate KD.

ATPase Assay
The dependence of the DbpA ATP hydrolysis
on ATP concentration (Figure 1A) was measured by pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled
assay as previously described.29 In this
assay, ATP hydrolysis is coupled with the oxidation of NADH to NAD+. The formation of NAD+ produces a decrease in
absorbance reading at 338 nm. The measurements were performed at 22
°C and using 96-well plates. The ATPase reactions were performed
in the presence of 2 μM RNA, 30 nM DbpA, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5),
50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20, 5% glycerol,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.250 mM NADH, 9 units mL–1 pyruvate kinase, 13 units mL–1 lactate
dehydrogenase, and 0–5 mM ATP·Mg concentrations. The RNA
molecule used for these experiments had the same sequence as the RNA
shown in Figure 1A,
but was nonbiotinylated. RNA was annealed through the same temperature
cycles and in the same buffer condition as RNA used for the SPR experiment.
Similar to the SPR experiments, these experiments were also performed
at 22 °C. The Michaelis–Menten equation was used to fit
the data. Km (Michaelis–Menten
constant) and kcat (the turnover number)
were obtained from the fit.
