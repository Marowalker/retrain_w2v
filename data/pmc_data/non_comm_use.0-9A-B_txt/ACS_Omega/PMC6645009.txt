Floating orbitals for valence electrons
have made cameo appearances at several stages in the history of quantum
chemistry. Most often, they were considered as potentially useful
basis functions and, more recently, also as muses for the development
of subatomistic force fields. To facilitate computation, these orbitals
are generally taken to be real spherical Gaussians. However, the computational
advantages carry over to complex Gaussians. Here, we explore the potential
utility of an imaginary part. Analytical equations for two mobile
electrons show that an imaginary part shifts the balance between contributions
to the exchange energy that favor parallel versus antiparallel electron
spins. However, an imaginary part also carries a large kinetic energy
penalty. The imaginary part is therefore negligible for two valence
electrons, except in the case of strong core–valence exchange
interactions. This consideration allows a self-consistent model for
the nd2 triplet ground states of transition metal ions
versus the ns2 singlet ground states of main group ions.

1 Introduction
Typically, calculations
of electronic structure in wave mechanics employ linear combinations
of basis functions that are centered on the atoms. Part of the rationale
includes our considerable intuition about the roles of various atomic
orbitals in bonding. On the other hand, because we also have considerable
intuition about electron density in bonding and lone pair regions,
the use of “floating” (or “distributed”
or “bond”) orbitals has frequently been explored on
the premise that they can afford more compact and less costly basis
sets.1−8 However, because it is less straightforward to situate and size
such orbitals than to solve for coefficients in large linear combinations
of atomic orbitals (LCAOs), the latter approach has generally prevailed.

On a separate track in computational chemistry, Monte Carlo (MC)
and molecular dynamics (MD) techniques have been used with atomistic
force fields to simulate atomic trajectories in molecules of ever
increasing size. However, these same tools can simultaneously be used
to situate and size floating orbitals.9,10 In the same
spirit, these tools have also been applied to subatomistic force fields
in which valence electrons are modeled as semiclassical particles,
a construct that has enabled highly efficient, turnkey simulations of chemical
reactions among molecules that are intrinsically flexible and polarizable.11 In effect, the semiclassical approach assigns
valence electrons to floating orbitals with parameters that evolve
according to MC or MD protocols. Thus, it seems timely to revisit
the floating orbital approach.

Whether atom-centered or floating,
orbitals have generally been described with Gaussian functions 1  for the ease of evaluating the integrals
involved in energy calculations12 (with
cusp conditions accommodated by sums of concentric Gaussians in some
cases13,14 and by distance-dependent corrections in
others15,16). Moreover, the employed Gaussians have
generally been taken to be real. (The main exception is in ab initio
descriptions of resonance states, where it has proven convenient to
transform the problem by a rotation of the electron coordinates in
the complex plane.17−22) When real Gaussians comprise a basis set, the wave functions are
complex only to the extent that the coefficients of the linear combinations
are complex and each Gaussian contributes to the wave function with
a constant phase. In the semiclassical use of floating spherical Gaussian
orbitals (FSGOs), there has been no phase variation at all.23−25 Here, we consider what may be gained by lifting these severe constraints
by allowing the variable a in eq 1 to be complex.

In section 2, we derive the energies of
electrons occupying complex FSGOs. In section 3, we explore the simplest, symmetric case
of two electrons with a nucleus at the midpoint between them. This
makes it easier to identify the unique features that are contributed
by the imaginary parts of the orbitals. In particular, we show that
the imaginary parts attenuate the contributions to the exchange energy
that favor paired spins more strongly than they attenuate contributions
that favor unpaired spins. In section 4, we apply these equations to He-like species, the
simplest cases that involve exchange integrals. We find that the imaginary
parts of the FSGOs turn out to be negligible (close to 0) compared
to the real parts, which leads to the result that electron pairing
is favored, consistent with the singlet 1s2 ground states
of these species. In section 5, we consider other ions with just two valence electrons.
Here, we first model the shielding effects of the core electrons and
show that electron pairing is still favored. In section 6, we add a model for the exchange effects
of the core electrons and show that this results in an imaginary part
of the FSGOs large enough to favor the triplet state. This suggests
that the high-spin ground states of transition metals are stabilized
by core–valence exchange interactions. Finally, we discuss
the implications of these results for developing subatomistic force
fields that are transferable between main group and transition metal
elements.

2 Energies of Electrons Occupying Complex FSGOs
We focus on a two-electron system because that is the simplest
that includes the exchange contributions that distinguish the energies
for like and unlike electron spins. Given wave functions Ψ↓↓ and Ψ↓↑, respectively,
these energies are  and 2  where the Hamiltonian includes
the quantum kinetic energy of the electrons, the repulsion between
the electrons, and the attraction of the electrons to a nucleus N with nuclear charge ZN 3  and the antisymmetric wave functions for two electrons
of like spin (αα or ββ) or unlike spin (αβ
or βα) are 4  and 5  respectively, where the spatial orbitals Φa and Φb are FSGOs (eq 1). The forms for electrons with unlike spins
(eq 5) fulfill the requirement
that the α spin is consistently associated with the electron
at position a (top) or position b (bottom), while the β spin
is consistently associated with the other position. An important consequence
is that the exchange integrals for electrons of unlike spins are identically
zero due to the orthogonality of spins in the cross-terms. This is
physically reasonable given that electrons with unlike spins are not
indistinguishable particles. Thus 6  where,
given the symmetry of the Hamiltonian 7a  (where we now adopt the conventional
compact notation with implicit electrons indices) and 7b  The exchange energy is therefore 8  where 9  and 10  

Going forward, it is convenient to distinguish
between terms arising from the kinetic, repulsive, and attractive
parts of the Hamiltonian with the notation 11   12  and 13  

Indicating a complex conjugate with an asterisk, defining
a measure of the inequivalence of a and b as 14  and making use of Boys’
integrals12 defined as 15  the energies are given by 16   17   18   19   20   21  and 22  where 23  

As expected, ΔUK is positive; the antisymmetric spatial wave
function (eq 4) has tighter
curvature corresponding to greater kinetic energy. Also, as expected,
ΔUR is negative because the antisymmetric
spatial wave function (eq 4) has depleted electron density between the center’s of the
two FSGOs, reducing the probability of close encounters between the
two electrons. For the same reason, ΔUA is positive when the nucleus is in the region between the
centers of the two FSGOs, where the electron density is diminished.
Of course, when a* = a and b* = b, these results are the same as those
obtained previously for FSGOs with no imaginary part.25

3 Unique Role of the Imaginary Component
In order to explore the difference that an imaginary component of
the FSGO can make, it helps to consider the case of 24  where  and  are
real numbers and i = (−1)1/2. This
equality is a reasonable approximation for two electrons in similar
environments. Substituting eq 24 into eqs 15–22 yields 25   26   27   28   29   30   31   32  

The approximation in eq 32 assumes that the vector between electrons of like spin is
essentially orthogonal to the vector from the nucleus to the midpoint
between the electrons. This is a reasonable approximation for electrons
that are both close to a given nucleus, which are the only pairs that
make significant contributions to ΔUA anyway.

For species with one nucleus and
just two electrons, it is also expected that the nucleus will be located
at the midpoint between the two electrons, as illustrated in Figure 1. In that case 33  

Figure 1 Two electrons with loci on opposite sides of a bare nucleus (core
electron density ρN = 0) or kernel
(core electron density ρN > 0).

Combining eqs 30, 31, and 33, we find that, when , Uex > 0 for all  and r when ZN =
1 (see Figure 2a) and
the more so when ZN >
1 (because the positive value of ΔUA increases with ZN).

Figure 2 Uex (in MJ/mol) vs  (in Å–2) and r (in Å) for (a) ZN = 1 and ()
= 0, (b) ZN = 1 and ()
= 1, and (c) ZN = 30
and ()
= 1.

As expected,  adds to the kinetic energy (eq 26) because it increases
the curvature of the wave function, whereas it has no effect on the
electrostatic energies (eqs 27 and 28) because they depend only on
the distribution of electron density. The more interesting results
are those for the exchange energy (eqs 29-33).  has a damping effect via the exponential
in Ω (eq 29).
However, this is offset in varying degrees by the exaggerating effect
of  on ΔUK, ΔUR, and ΔUA (eqs 30–33). This is especially so for
ΔUA and ΔUR where  results in terms
in which F0 has a negative argument. These
terms can be large because, as is evident in eq 15 and illustrated in Figure 3, F0(−x) becomes exponentially large with increasing x. It is also notable that the coefficients for  are
such that their effect is greater in ΔUR (eq 31) than
in ΔUA (eq 33). Thus,  increases
the influence of the negative ΔUR which favors like (i.e., unpaired) spins versus the positive (ΔUK + ΔUA) which
favors unlike (i.e., paired) spins. The range of Uex < 0 when  is illustrated in Figure 2b,c.

Figure 3 Graph of ln[F0(x)] vs x.

Of course, this influence of  is
unhelpful for He-like species, which are all 1s2 singlets
in the ground state. Thus, it is important to examine whether  is
sufficiently small for these species (as we do in section 4). However, a more interesting
application for floating orbitals is the description of valence electrons
in heavy elements. Therefore, we go on (in Sections 5 and 6) to consider
the influence of core electrons in ions with two valence electrons.
Of these, the main group ions have low-spin ground states (e.g., 2s2 and 3s2 singlets) consistent with smaller values
of , and
the transition metal ions have high-spin ground states (e.g., 3d2 triplets) consistent with larger values of .

4 He and He-like Ions
In these two-fold symmetric species,
there are three degrees of freedom: 34  See eq 24 and Figure 1. We find that the kinetic energy penalty for  (in eq 26) is sufficiently large that the minimum
of U↑↑() occurs at  ∼
0 for all values of ZN. Furthermore, as Uex > 0 when  for all ZN, , and r, it follows that U↑↑ > U↑↓ for He and all
He-like ions, consistent with the known 1s2 singlet ground
states of these species.

5 Influence of Core Electrons:
Shielding
A convenient and effective model for the distribution
of core electrons is another Gaussian26−28 35  as illustrated in Figure 1.

For a species with
nuclear charge ZN and
kernel charge QN, the
(ZN – QN) core electrons add a repulsive
term to the valence electron Hamiltonian such that eq 3 is replaced by 36  

The new term partially negates
the attraction of the valence electrons to the nucleus, with the shielding
increasing as cN increases
(i.e., as the distribution of the core electrons is more contracted
around the nucleus). The effect is to replace eq 28 with 37  and eq 33 by 38  

Although UA is highly sensitive
to shielding (as illustrated in Figure 4), the shielding effect does not prevent the drive
of UK, ΔUK, and ΔUA toward small  from
overwhelming the drive of ΔUR toward
large , just
as it did across all values of ZN in the absence of shielding (in the previous section). Thus,
it remains that Uex > 0, which dictates
a singlet ground state. Comparing the results in Figure 5 with experiment (see abstract
graphic), we find that, although the valence FSGO construct greatly
overestimates the relative stability of the ns2 singlet
ground states of main group ions, the rising trend with increasing QN is reproduced. On the other
hand, the model does not accommodate the nd2 triplet ground
states of transition metal ions.

Figure 4 Variation of UA (in MJ/mol) vs r (in Å) for ZN = 30,  Å–2 with λ
= cN–1/2 = 0.0 (solid line), 0.5 (dashed line), and 1.0 (dotted line) Å.

Figure 5 Variation of (U↑↑ – U↑↓) (in kJ/mol)
vs Z for the first two full rows of main group elements
with complete shielding (λ = cN–1/2 = 0.0).

6 Influence of Core Electrons: Core–Valence Exchange
The above results are obtained without considering energy contributions
from valence-core exchange and it may be that valence–core
exchange is more important for transition metals where valence electrons
are going into a shell that is already partially filled in the kernel.
However, disaggregating the core electrons would greatly diminish
the utility of floating orbitals. Therefore, we consider whether the
effect of core–valence exchange can be represented by an empirical
term in UA. Given the (1/Ω) factor
shared by all the exchange terms, we expect that core–valence
exchange energy should diminish exponentially with distance and with . Thus, for exploratory
purposes, we replace eq 37 with eq 39. 39  In eq 39, the exchange term is proportional to the number of core electrons
of a given spin, (ZN – QN)/2, and has two scaling constants,
χN and τN, that can depend on the core. In particular, it is hypothesized
that χN is negligible when the core–shells
are filled (as for main group elements) and χN > 0 when they are not (as for transition metals). For χN > 0, the core–valence exchange
energy clearly favors larger  and
larger (),
with the latter favoring the triplet state.

Figure 6 shows
that the results are strongly dependent on the shielding, with the
triplet state favored only when shielding is sufficiently strong (i.e.,
when the value of λ = cN–1/2 is sufficiently small). Notably, although
the magnitude of the stabilization of the triplet is small compared
to the experimental values (see abstract graphic), the trend across
the transition metals is correct, with greater stabilization of the
[Ar]3d2 triplet state for larger ZN. Given that spherical Gaussians are obviously
crude descriptions of the valence orbitals and core electron distribution,
the quantitative discrepancy is understandable, whereas the qualitative
agreement suggests that attribution of the triplet ground state in
[Ar]3d2 ions to core–valence exchange is phenomenologically
reasonable.

the ions of several first row transition elements, taking χN = 2 and τN = 0.5. From left to right: Zn10+, Ni8+, Fe6+, Cr4+, and Ti2+.

7 Discussion and Conclusions
Our goal
has been to identify how the imaginary part of a floating orbital
might be useful in describing valence electrons. We find that an imaginary
part changes the balance between different contributions to the exchange
energy for a pair of electrons such that the bias against the triplet
state is reduced. However, due to the large contribution of an imaginary
part to the kinetic energy, the imaginary part is generally negligible.
This is consistent with the 1s2 singlet ground states of
all He-like ions. For more relevant ions, we consider the effect of
core electrons on a pair of valence electrons. Initially considering
only shielding of the nuclear attraction, we again find that the imaginary
part of the floating orbital is negligible. This is consistent with
the ns2 singlet ground states of the ions of the main group
elements, including qualitative trends within and between rows but
not with the nd2 triplet ground states of the ions of the
transition metals. We hypothesize that the latter reflects core–valence
exchange interactions, supposing that this effect is more important
when the valence electrons belong to the same shell as the “outermost”
core electrons. Choosing a plausible form for the core–valence
exchange energy, we find imaginary parts that are sufficiently large
to stabilize the triplet state when the shielding is sufficiently
strong (i.e., when the core electron density is sufficiently compact).
Moreover, the stabilization shows the correct trend, becoming stronger
with increasing atomic number. However, the magnitude of the stabilization
is small compared to experimental values.

The analytical forms
of the energy integrals obtained here rely on the use of spherical
Gaussians for valence electron orbitals and core electron densities.
As this is a crude approximation, we expect no more than qualitative
insight. However, such insights have proved useful in the development
of subatomistic force fields in which independently mobile valence
electrons are modeled as semiclassical particles interacting with
each other and with kernels via potentials that take quantum effects
into account. For a number of main group elements, studies based on
spherical Gaussian orbitals have provided the forms of the potentials
implemented in eFF23 and an interpretation
of the potentials discovered heuristically in LEWIS.25 The present work shows how this approach may be extended
to the transition metals. Whereas, the main group elements only require that
the valence electrons have four dynamic variables (a set of three
Cartesian coordinates and a real cloud size parameter), including
the transition metals requires a fifth dynamic variable (an imaginary
cloud size parameter). This additional dynamic variable (which is
expected to be significant in magnitude only near the kernel of a
transition metal) imposes a very modest addition to computational
overhead.
