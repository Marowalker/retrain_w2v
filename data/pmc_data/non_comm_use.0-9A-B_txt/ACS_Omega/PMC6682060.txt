In this study, we detail the development
of a concise and efficient
three-component protocol for the regioselective synthesis of highly
functionalized bis-indoles through a one-pot, two-step sequential
process starting from enaminones 1, indoles 2, and acenaphthylene-1,2-dione 3 that is catalyzed by
piperidine and p-methyl benzenesulfonic acid. This
protocol has several advantages including simplicity of experimental
operation, high efficiency of bond formation, ready availability and
low cost of starting materials, environmentally benign conditions,
and target molecular diversity.

Introduction
Indole and its derivatives
belong to a fascinating and important
class of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds that have been regarded as
privileged scaffolds found in many biologically active pharmaceuticals
and natural products.1 They can also be
used as nucleophiles for organic synthesis,2 and of these, the molecularly diverse bis-indole skeletons are frequently
found in natural products and possess broad spectrum biological activities.
For example, topsentin and its analogue, (R)-6′-debromohamacanthin
B (Figure 1), were
originally isolated from the marine sponge and have shown antitumor,
antiviral, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities.3 Another analogue, isoborreverine4 (Figure 1) has exhibited antimalarial activity.5 Whereas indirubin (Figure 1), a potent and selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor6 and dioxin receptor,7 was found as glycogen synthase kinase-38 and aurora kinases9 and possesses antitumor
activity.10 Therefore, in the effort to
develop novel and efficient methodologies for synthesis, these bis-indole
and simple bis-indole alkaloids have attracted our attention.

examples of natural bis-indoles and the target molecule.

Multicomponent reactions (MCRs)11 are
powerful tools for the construction of multi-C–C and C–hetero
bonds. They can generate high levels of diverse and complex molecules
where at least three polyfunctional raw materials react in an ordered
fashion via tandem processes. These reactions can avoid purification
intermediates and allow savings of both solvents and reagents. Other
inherent characteristics of MCRs include regio- and chemo-selectivity,
atom and step economy, step efficiency, target molecular diversity,
and operational simplicity.12

On
the other hand, diversity-oriented synthesis is an application
that is widely used in biological and medical research and has led
to the rapid development of broadly used synthons.13 Enaminones are powerful and versatile building blocks that
have been widely used in the synthesis of pharmacologically interesting
heterocyclic and fused heterocyclic compounds, including acridines,
indoles, naphthyridines, quinolones, pyrroles, thiazines, pyridines,
and thiazoles.14 Some of these heterocycles
demonstrate to have promising biological activity, such as antimicrobial
activity,15 and have potential as protein
kinase CK2 inhibitors.16

Recently,
our group has developed several novel MCRs based on enaminones
that can offer convenient and efficient access to heterocycles and
fused heterocycles.17 For the purpose of
continuing our previous endeavors in and furthering our knowledge
of the fabrication of aza heterocycles, we set out to develop a new
synthetic protocol for efficient synthesis of polycyclic bis-indoles
through a one-pot, two-step, three-component reaction of enaminones 1 and indoles 2, with acenaphthylene-1,2-dione 3, and report it herein (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Pathways for the Synthesis of Bis-Indoles
Results and Discussion
Acenaphthenequinones have proven to be an appealing building block
for the reaction of their 1,2-biselectrophilic centers and have thus
been widely used for the detection of the nucleophilic group. Indole
specifically possesses three nucleophilic centers. Several reports
have detailed the utilization of its C-3 position as a nucleophilic
center for the construction of 3-substituted indole derivatives. Acenaphthenequinone
can provide two active sites, which can be reacted with the electron-rich
C-3 atom of indoles. A recent report has found that the reaction of
two indole molecules with acenaphthenequinone that is catalyzed by
acid can afford the symmetrical bisindoly acenaphthylen-1(2H)-one 6.18 However,
a report describing the use of acenaphthenequinone and indole for
the formation of indoyl-acenaphthylen-1(2H)-one 5 has yet to be realized (Scheme 2). Accordingly, we focused our efforts on
searching for potential catalysts and suitable reaction conditions
for the synthesis of indoyl-acenaphthylen-1(2H)-one 5, which serves as a bis-electrophile (C=O and C–OH
as electrophilic sites) and reacts with bis-nucleophile enaminones
to produce polycyclic bis-indoles 4 via [3 + 2] annulation
reaction.

Scheme 2 Acenaphthenequinone and Indoles React in Different
Ways
On the basis of the above analysis,
we began our investigation
by performing the reaction of indole 2a and 3 in the presence of different catalysts (0.2 equiv) in ethanol at
reflux. First, we investigated the organic bases, which included piperidine,
DBU, and Et3N, and then obtained the corresponding indole-3-yl
products 5 with 92, 79, and 85% yields, respectively.
Next, we tested some acidic catalysts, which included HOAc, TsOH,
and trifluoroacetyl, and found that only bisindoly acenaphthylen-1(2H)-one 6 was formed even when using a molar
ratio of 1:1 of 2a:3. Finally, several solvents
(CH3OH, dioxane, CH2Cl2, and CH3CN) were used in our experiments, and the yields did not show
obvious affection. These results indicated that the best conditions
for the synthesis of 5 could be the use of piperidine
as a base at reflux.

The subsequent reaction of intermediate 5 with enaminones 1 requires a suitable acid
to eliminate the hydroxyl and generate
carbocation. Based on this, we decided to screen different acidic
catalysts and solvents (Table 1). Initially, this reaction was performed in the presence
of p-TsOH for an hour at room temperature in ethanol,
but the reaction did not occur (Table 1, entry 1). However, when the reaction temperature
was raised to reflux, we obtained a 72% yield of bis-indole derivative 4a (Table 1, entry 2). After that, we employed several other Brønsted acids,
such as KHSO4, HOAc, CF3COOH, CF3SO3H, and l-proline, as well as Lewis acids,
such as AlCl3 and ZnCl2, in an effort to improve
the yield, but the results showed that these catalysts could not promote
this reaction efficiently (Table 1, entries 3–9). Next, we optimized different
solvents and examined a variety of both polar and nonpolar solvents.
We found that methylene chloride/methanol (CH2Cl2/CH3OH) was a more suitable solvent than ethanol for this
reaction. Despite this, because of the volatility and toxicity of
methylene chloride and methanol, we ultimately chose ethanol as the
solvent for our future reactions. Finally, when we carried out the
three-component in one-step reaction of 1 with 2 and 3 under similar conditions, we did not
observe the expected product 4, instead we saw that only
intermediate 6 was afforded. These findings indicate
that the steric hindrance of 1 and the nucleophilicity
of the substrates might control the reaction pathway.

conditions, unless stated
otherwise, step 1: indole 2a (1.0 mmol), acenaphthenequinone 3 (1.0 mmol), and piperidine (0.2 mmol) in solvent (15 mL);
step 2: enaminone 1a (1.0 mmol), catalyst (0.5 mmol).

b Values are the isolated products.

c Reaction was conducted by one-step,
one-pot; only intermediate 6 was obtained.

Having established the optimum reaction
conditions, we set out
to explore the generality of the substrate of this transformation,
the results of which are presented in Figure 2. At the start, we tested the substrate scope
of enaminones 1 and found that, whether or not the substituent
with diverse substitution patterns (para, ortho, and meta) on the
aromatic ring of enaminones 1 was electron-donating or
electron-withdrawing, the reaction could afford the corresponding
bis-indoles 4 with good to excellent yield. Additionally,
when including N-substituted 3-amino-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-enones
and N-substituted 3-aminocyclohex-2-enonephenyls, all reactions proceeded
well and yielded the corresponding bis-indoles derivatives (Figure 2, 4a–4x).

Figure 2 Substrate scope of the reaction for bis-indoles
4. Reaction conditions:
indoles 2 (1.0 mmol), acenaphthenequinone 3 (1.0 mmol), and piperidine (0.2 mmol) in ethanol (15 mL) under reflux,
and then the addition of enaminone 1 (1.0 mmol) and p-TSA (0.5 mmol). Isolated yield based on enaminone 1.

In order to explore the application
of the present approach, we
also evaluated the scope of the indoles. The 6-fluoroindole, 6-chloroindole,
and 5-methylindole were used as substrates under the optimal conditions
and generated the desired products (Figure 2, e.g., 4c, 4i,
and 4x) with moderate and excellent yields, respectively.

The chemical structures of bis-indoles 4 were fully
characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR), 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra.
The intermediates 5 and 6 were isolated
and identified using 1H NMR and 13C NMR (see
the Supporting Information). In order to
propose a plausible reaction mechanism, we tested the reaction of
intermediates 5a and 1a in ethanol in the
presence of p-TSA and obtained the expected target
molecule 4 with the consumption of 5a.

Based on the above results and previous literature,19 a tentative mechanism for the three-component
reaction was proposed, as outlined in Scheme 3. First, indoles 2 reacted with
acenaphthylene-1,2-dione 3 via aza-ene addition reaction
to generate intermediate [A] prompted by the piperidine;
meanwhile, [A] undergoes a process of imine-enamine tautomerization
to give intermediate 5. Then, intermediate 5 accepts one proton to form [C], and losing one molecule
water to form intermediate [C] gives iminium ion [D]. Intermediate [D] reacted with enaminone 1 to form intermediate [E] via a Michael addition.
Finally, intermediate [E] underwent an intramolecular
N-cyclization mediated by acidic that affords the bis-indoles 4.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have successfully disclosed a novel, efficient,
simple route for the synthesis of highly functionalized bis-indoles
by a one-pot, two-step, three-component reaction of indoles, acenaphthylene-1,2-dione,
and enaminones. The simplicity of operation, ready availability of
starting materials, target molecular diversity, environmental sustainability
with high atom economy, and excellent regioselectivity make this method
a valuable complementary tool in the construction of bis-indoles.
We therefore believe that such an efficient and simple methodology
could have great potential for many applications as well as for the
optimization of the synthetic production of bis-indoles, which has
peaked interest and held the attention of the organic chemistry and
medicinal communities.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All chemicals and solvents were directly
used, without further purification unless otherwise stated. Materials 2 and 3 were ordered from Adamas Reagent Ltd.
The silica gel (200–300 mesh) was used to perform column chromatography.
All synthesized chemical molecules were characterized by full spectroscopic
data. A Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz) was used to characterize the 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra with
DMSO-d6 as a solvent and tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard. J values are given in Hz,
and chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm. A Fourier transform
infrared Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 was used to characterize IR spectra
by using a KBr pellet. The whole process of each reaction was monitored
in real time by the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with silica gel
GF254. A XT-4A melting point apparatus was used to detect the melting
points without further correction. HRMS was characterized on an Agilent
LC/Msd TOF and monoisotopic mass instrument.

General Procedure for Synthesis
of Bis-Indoles 4
The chemical of indoles 2 (1.0 mmol), acenaphthylene-1,2-dione 3 (1.0
mmol), and piperidine (0.2 mmol) was first dissolved
in ethanol (15 mL) together. The reaction mixture was then refluxed
for a certain period of time by monitoring with TLC. Enaminone 1 (1.0 mmol) and p-TSA (0.5 mmol) were further
added into the mixture and stirred at reflux temperature. At the end
of the reaction, as monitored by TLC, the reaction mixture was terminated
by diluting with 50 mL of water and cooled to room temperature. Afterward,
the mixture was extracted with 50 mL of EtOAc two times. Then, the
organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under a vacuum. Finally, flash chromatography with
petroleum ether–ethyl acetate (1:2, v/v) was used for the purification
of the residue and giving a white compound solid 4 with
high purification.
