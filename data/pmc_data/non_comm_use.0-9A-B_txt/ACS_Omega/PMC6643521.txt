The
K2NiF6 catalytic effect on the NaAlH4 dehydrogenation properties was studied in this work. The
desorption temperature was studied using temperature-programmed desorption and
exhibited a lower onset hydrogen release after doped with different
wt % of K2NiF6 (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt %). It was
found that the NaAlH4 doped with 5 wt % K2NiF6 showed the optimal value that can reduce the onset desorption
temperature of about 160 °C compared to 190 °C for the milled
NaAlH4. The NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6 sample showed faster desorption kinetics where 1.5 wt % of
hydrogen was released in 30 min at 150 °C. In contrast, the milled
NaAlH4 only released about 0.2 wt % within the same time
and temperature. From the Kissinger analysis, the apparent activation
energy was 114.7 kJ/mol for the milled NaAlH4 and 89.9
kJ/mol for the NaAlH4-doped 5 wt % K2NiF6, indicating that the addition of K2NiF6 reduced the activation energy for hydrogen desorption of NaAlH4. It is deduced that the new phases of AlNi, NaF, and KH that
were formed in situ during the dehydrogenation process are the key
factors for the improvement of dehydrogenation properties of NaAlH4.

Introduction
Hydrogen has been considered to be the
most promising candidate
as a suitable energy carrier as it produces only water as a byproduct
of the energy generation. As an energy carrier, hydrogen holds the
potential to fundamentally secure our future energy supply and draw
it more environmentally favorable. However, both hydrogen production
and storage are the most important issues to realize for the development
of hydrogen economy, especially for the transportation application.1−3 According to the latest US Department of Energy (DOE) targets for
2020, the fuel cell demands hydrogen storage materials with more than
4.5 wt % of hydrogen capacity and faster sorption kinetics.4 Storing hydrogen in the solid state form benefits
the onboard applications in the aspects of safety, economy, and efficiency
as compared to the gas or cryogenic liquid form.5,6 Complex
metal hydride, which is NaAlH4 has become a promising candidate
material for the solid-state hydrogen storage because of the high
gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities. It is well-known that
the dehydrogenation of NaAlH4 consists of three steps based
on the reactions as follows 1   2   3  

The hydrogen content for NaAlH4 is 7.4 wt % of which
5.5 wt % can be released under moderate temperature for two dehydrogenation
steps.7 However, the operation temperature
is still high and sluggish de/rehydrogenation kinetics limit NaAlH4 for practical applications.8 A
lot of methods have been used to improve the performance of NaAlH4 such as by ball milling,9 adding
the catalyst,10−13 and destabilizing with other hydrides.14−16 Among them,
the hydrogen storage properties of NaAlH4 greatly enhanced
by the addition of catalyst. Different types of catalysts such as
metal,10,17 metal oxide,11,18 and metal
halide19,20 have been doped into NaAlH4.
Recently, Khan and Jain21 reported that
TiO2-doped NaAlH4 showed faster desorption kinetics
with improved hydrogen capacity (3.6–5.1 wt %) at 250 °C,
while the study on the effect of Nb2O5 on the
dehydrogenation kinetics of NaAlH4 revealed that the amount
of desorbed hydrogen varied between 4.8 and 5.0 wt % at 250 °C
following the catalyst content.22 In the
other study on the effect of metal chlorides (TiCl3, PdCl2, and CeCl3) on the hydrogen desorption of NaAlH4, Khan and Jain23 found that the
amount of hydrogen desorbed at a temperature below 150 °C was
less than 1 wt %. The amount of hydrogen desorbed increased as the
dehydrogenation temperature rose and 2 wt % CeCl3 gave
the higher amount of hydrogen desorbed which was 5.4 wt % at 250 °C.
However, a total comprehension of the effects of catalysts on the
improvement of the NaAlH4 dehydrogenation properties is
insufficient and there is room for improvements. In addition, different
complex metal hydride requires a different catalyst because it will
give different roles and effects. Thus, it is essential to find another
type of catalyst that has a potential to enhance the NaAlH4 dehydrogenation properties without sacrificing its hydrogen storage
capacity, especially at a lower operating temperature.

To date,
no research has been found that surveyed the effect of
the K2NiF6 additive on the hydrogen storage
properties of NaAlH4. So far, only Sulaiman et al.24,25 reported the applications of K2NiF6 as the
additive for the MgH2 system. They claimed that the formed
species, KF, KH, and Mg2Ni were acting synergistically
and were responsible for the enhancement of the MgH2 sorption
properties. Moreover, the combination of three elements of K, Ti,
and F on NaAlH4 has been reported by Liu et al.26 They found that the NaAlH4–0.025
K2TiF6 sample can release about 4.4. wt % of
hydrogen within 40 min at 140 °C. Therefore, it can be speculated
that the K2NiF6 may also give a similar effect
on NaAlH4. In addition, Ni is one of the good catalysts
for MgH2.27−31 The doping effect of the Ni element is more notable than Ti because
of the hardness of Ni that can help to reduce the particle size of
MgH2, thus reduced the initial dehydrogenation temperature
as studied by Zhang et al.32 Meanwhile,
Yahya and Ismail33 in their current study
reported the effect of Ni on the hydrogen storage properties of the
MgH2–SrTiO3 composite. Their result showed
that the decomposition temperature was reduced to 260 °C for
the MgH2–10 wt % SrTiO3–5 wt %
Ni composite with a total of 6 wt % hydrogen released. Thus, it was
hypothesized in this present study that K2NiF6 may play a vital part as a dopant precursor which can give a synergetic
catalytic impact on the hydrogen storage properties of NaAlH4. Therefore, the aim of this work is to investigate the dehydrogenation
properties of NaAlH4 with the addition of the K2NiF6 catalyst and the possible catalytic mechanism will
also be discussed.

Results and Discussions
The curves
of the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of the
undoped NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 doped with various
amounts of K2NiF6 (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt %) is
shown in Figure 1.
Pure NaAlH4 starts to release hydrogen at around 190 °C.
The dehydrogenation reaction for the first two steps has completed
at 300 °C with a total hydrogen release of about 5.7 wt %. This
result is very close to the theoretical value and in good agreement
with a previous study.34 On the other hand,
the milled NaAlH4 has a close onset desorption temperature
as the pure NaAlH4. This outcome shows that the 1 h ball
milling process has a minimal impact on the dehydrogenation properties
of NaAlH4. However, the dehydrogenation process completed
at a lower temperature than the pure NaAlH4 for two-step
decomposition (280 °C) with a total hydrogen release of 5.5 wt
%. Compared to the undoped sample, the onset desorption temperature
for different wt % of K2NiF6-doped NaAlH4 compounds show a lower dehydrogenation temperature. The NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6 sample starts to release
hydrogen at 160 °C and completed at around 260 °C for the
two-step dehydrogenation process. For the 10 wt % doped sample, the
dehydrogenation temperature starts to decompose at about 150 °C
and completes at 250 °C. The addition of 5 and 10 wt % K2NiF6 has reduced the onset desorption temperature
of NaAlH4 by 30 and 40 °C, respectively, as compared
with the milled NaAlH4. However, the total value of hydrogen
released is slightly reduced to 5.1 wt %. Meanwhile, the desorption
temperature has reduced to 145 °C after increasing the doping
value of K2NiF6 to 15 and 20 wt %. The dehydrogenation
process for 15 and 20 wt % doped samples was completed at 245 and
237 °C with a total hydrogen capacity at about 4.9 and 4.5 wt
%, respectively. This result indicates that a higher amount of doping further reduces the onset
desorption temperature and decreases the hydrogen capacity. This phenomenon
is believed because of the high level of the added amount of K2NiF6 that led to the excessive catalytic effect
and it is almost similar to our previous work.24,35

Figure 1 Curves
of the TPD of the pure NaAlH4, milled NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 doped with different amounts of K2NiF6 (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt %).

Figure 2 shows
the
hydrogen desorption curves of the milled NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 doped with 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt % of K2NiF6 at 150 °C. The hydrogen released of the milled NaAlH4 is only at about 0.5 wt % after 120 min, demonstrating poor
dehydrogenation kinetics of the undoped sample. The hydrogen has released
about 1.5 wt % at 30 min after being doped with 5 wt % K2NiF6. Further increasing the doping amount to 10, 15,
and 20 wt %, the result shows faster desorption rate in which the
hydrogen released about 2.1, 2.5, and 2.2 wt %, respectively within
30 min dehydrogenation. The total hydrogen capacity for the all doped
NaAlH4 is at about 3.0 wt % after 120 min dehydrogenation.
Therefore, the remarkable improvement in the dehydrogenation kinetics
of NaAlH4 can be achieved by the addition of the K2NiF6 additive. These results indicated that the
addition of minimum amount of K2NiF6 (5 wt %)
can reduce the onset decomposition temperature and improve the dehydrogenation
kinetics of NaAlH4. Thus, the NaAlH4 + 5 wt
% K2NiF6 sample was selected for further analysis.

desorption curves of the milled NaAlH4 and
NaAlH4 doped with different amount of K2NiF6 (5, 10, 15, and 20 wt %).

To compare the thermal properties of the doped and undoped
composite, Figure 3 shows the differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of the milled NaAlH4 and
NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6 samples. The
samples were measured at 100–350 °C with a heating rate
of 25 °C. Three endothermic peaks are shown by the DSC curves
of the undoped sample curve. The decomposition of NaAlH4 is signified by the first strong endothermic peak at approximately
195 °C. Meanwhile, the phase transition of α-Na3AlH6 to β-Na3AlH6 is signified
by the weaker peak at 278 °C. The third endothermic peak at approximately
310 °C is ascribed to the decomposition of Na3AlH6 into NaH and Al. The pattern of this result is almost the
same as reported in the previous study by Mao et al.20,34 In contrast, the K2NiF6-doped sample has shifted
to lower temperature with only two endothermic peaks appeared. These
two endothermic peaks decomposed at approximately 179 and 277 °C
correspond to the decomposition of NaAlH4 and Na3AlH6, respectively. The reduction in the peak temperature
of the DSC results revealed that the dehydrogenation properties of
NaAlH4 have improved with the addition of K2NiF6.

Figure 3 DSC traces of the milled NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6 (heating rate: 25 °C/min;
argon flow: 50 mL/min).

The activation energy for the dehydrogenation of NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6 was calculated to investigate
the impact of the introduction of K2NiF6 on
the kinetic property of NaAlH4. In this context, the Kissinger
plot was prepared based on the Kissinger equation36 as follows 4  where β is the heating
rate, Tp is the peak temperature obtained
from the
DSC curve, R is the gas constant, and A is the linear constant. Thus, the activation energy can be achieved
from the slope in a plot of ln[β/Tp2] versus 1000/Tp. Figures 4 and 5 show the DSC traces at various heating rates and Kissinger
plot for the first-step and second-step dehydrogenation of doped and
undoped NaAlH4, respectively. From the Kissinger plot of
the DSC data for the first-step dehydrogenation as shown in Figure 4c, the apparent activation
energy of the milled NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 + 5 wt
% K2NiF6 was found to be 114.7 and 89.9 kJ/mol.

plot for the first-step dehydrogenation of NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6.

Figure 5 DSC traces for the second-step dehydrogenation of (a) NaAlH4, (b) NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6, and
(c) Kissinger plot for the second-step dehydrogenation of NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6.

Meanwhile, Figure 5c shows the second step dehydrogenation apparent
activation energy
of the doped and undoped NaAlH4. The NaAlH4 +
5 wt % K2NiF6 sample gives an activation energy
value of about 99.6 kJ/mol, while the undoped sample has an activation
energy of 125.2 kJ/mol. The activation energies for the NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6 are reduced by 24.8
and 25.6 kJ/mol for the first and second step dehydrogenation, respectively,
which are significantly lower compared to those of undoped NaAlH4. This result indicated that the dehydrogenation behavior
of NaAlH4 has remarkably improved by the addition of K2NiF6 with the reduction of the Ea value.

Table 1 shows the
comparison of activation energy of the undoped and different catalysts
doped to NaAlH4. Referring to this table, all the catalysts
have effectively reduced the apparent activation energy of the NaAlH4 for the first and second step dehydrogenation. As can be
seen from the table, K2NiF6-doped NaAlH4 does not have the best reduction in the Ea value as compared to the other catalysts. The NaAlH4-doped with NiFe2O4 shows the lowest Ea value which is 54.3 and 73.1 kJ/mol, for the
first and second step dehydrogenation specifically. However, the addition
of K2NiF6 still gives the positive effect on
the reduction of the apparent activation energy of NaAlH4.

Figure 6 shows the
morphologies of the pure NaAlH4, pure K2NiF6, milled NaAlH4, and NaAlH4 + 5 wt %
K2NiF6. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
image shows an irregular shape with the average particle size was
in the range of 100 μm for the pure NaAlH4 (Figure 6a). The pure K2NiF6 without further treatment had a smaller particle
size which is smaller than 100 μm (Figure 6b). In addition, after the milling process,
the particles size of the doped and undoped sample reduced drastically.
However, the particle size of the milled NaAlH4 (Figure 6c) was inhomogenous
and agglomerated. This may be the reason for the slightly reduced
onset temperature in the TPD results for milled NaAlH4 as
shown in Figure 1.
It can be observed that the particles of the NaAlH4-doped
with 5 wt % K2NiF6 (Figure 6d) were dispersed more homogeneously and
less agglomeration than those of the undoped NaAlH4. The
particle size appeared to have a finer surface and reduced drastically
as compared with the undoped sample.

Figure 6 SEM images of (a) pure NaAlH4, (b) pure K2NiF6, (c) milled NaAlH4, and (d) NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6.

The particle sizes of the pure
NaAlH4 and NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6 are determined by Image
J software and the particle size distributions are plotted in histograms
as shown in Figure 7. On the basis of the histograms, the estimated average of particle
sizes are 21.86 and 0.14 μm for the pure NaAlH4 and
NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6, respectively.
This indicates that the milling process and the addition of catalyst
remarkably reduced the particle size of the compound. The particle
size reduction can increase the specific surface area and reduce the
diffusion length of hydrogen within the particles which can lead to
the increment of the kinetic rates as reported by previous studies.42,43

Figure 8 presents
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pure NaAlH4 and the pure K2NiF6. The purity of the NaAlH4 and K2NiF6 compounds are corroborated
by the XRD patterns of the as-received NaAlH4 (JCPDS card
no. 22-1337), as well as the as-received K2NiF6 (JCPDS card no. 22-837). This result is correlated with data previously
reported.39,44

Figure 8 XRD patterns of the (a) pure NaAlH4 and (b) pure K2NiF6.

The XRD patterns as in Figure 9 exhibit the milled NaAlH4 and the milled
K2NiF6-doped with 5 and 20 wt % samples. The
NaAlH4 does not decompose during the ball milling process
and it is confirmed by the XRD pattern of the milled NaAlH4. In that XRD pattern, only the NaAlH4 phase has appeared.
Meanwhile, the XRD pattern for NaAlH4-doped with 5 and
20 wt % K2NiF6 after ball milling shows that
only NaAlH4 and K2NiF6 peaks appeared.
This demonstrates that the K2NiF6 additive does
not react with NaAlH4 and remains stable throughout the
whole process of milling. The present finding seems to be consistent
with the result reported by Huang et al.,11 which found that no reaction had occurred between NaAlH4 and NiFe2O4 throughout the ball milling process
in their study.

Figure 9 XRD patterns of the (a) milled NaAlH4, (b)
NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6, and (c) NaAlH4 + 20 wt % K2NiF6 after 1 h ball milling.

In order to confirm whether there
is a reaction occuring or not
after the ball milling process, Fourier transform infrared spectra
(FTIR) measurement was performed for milled NaAlH4 and
NaAlH4-doped with 5 and 20 wt % K2NiF6 as shown in Figure 10. For milled NaAlH4, two intense bands appeared at 1654
and 900 cm–1 which represent the characteristic
stretching mode and the bending mode of the Al–H vibration
in the AlH4 group, respectively. The pattern is almost
closed with the previous studies.12 Interestingly,
after being doped with 5 and 20 wt % of K2NiF6 similar stretching and bending mode are observed but slightly reduced
in intensity. This indicated that increasing the wt % of the additive
weakening the Al–H bonds of NaAlH4. All the bands
are still of NaAlH4 and no Na3AlH6 band is observed. Thus, it can be deduced that there is no reaction
occurring between the K2NiF6 and the host material
of NaAlH4 throughout the ball milling process.

Figure 10 FTIR spectra of the
milled NaAlH4, NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6, and NaAlH4 + 20 wt % K2NiF6 after 1 h ball milling.

The XRD measurement was carried out on the K2NiF6-doped NaAlH4 sample in order to verify the phase
structure after the dehydrogenation process. Figure 11 presents the XRD pattern of the NaAlH4-doped with 5 and 20 wt % K2NiF6 after
dehydrogenation at 300 °C under 1 atm hydrogen pressure. The
XRD analysis for the sample of 5 wt % K2NiF6 (Figure 11a) demonstrated
that only NaH and Al phases appeared with which no other compound
was observed. This indicated that NaAlH4 has completed
the first and second dehydrogenation step as shown in the reaction
of eqs 1 and 2 in the introduction part. As an addition the sample
with 20 wt % K2NiF6 was analyzed (Figure 11b) in order to
fully understand the phase composition of the sample as it is not
sufficient only with 5 wt % K2NiF6 because of
the low amount of the catalyst. It can be seen that new peaks of NaF,
AlNi, and KH can be observed by increasing the wt % of K2NiF6 to 20 wt %. This suggested that the reaction of NaAlH4 with K2NiF6 may have occurred. The
possible reaction between K2NiF6 and NaAlH4 during the dehydrogenation process is presented as follows 5  

Figure 11 XRD patterns of the (a) NaAlH4 + 5 wt % K2NiF6 and (b) NaAlH4 + 20 wt % K2NiF6 after dehydrogenation at 300 °C.

Meanwhile, the peak corresponding to NaH and Al remains unchanged
with the peak intensity gradually enhanced. This indicates that the
second step of the NaAlH4 has been accomplished.

The above results suggested that the in situ formation of AlNi,
KH, and NaF phases during the dehydrogenation process is important
which can play a vital role in the improvement of NaAlH4 dehydrogenation properties. This result corroborates the studies
by Li et al.45 which found the appearance
of Al–Ni peaks after dehydrogenation and demonstrated that
Ni–B doped with NaAlH4 is a promising catalyst for
enhancing the dehydrogenation properties of light metal complex hydride.
Meanwhile, introducing KH into NaAlH4 pronouncedly enhances
the dehydrogenation performances as well, especially for the decomposition
of Na3AlH6 as reported by Wang et al.46 Additionally, the in situ formation of NaF may
act as a grain refiner for NaH. It can help to promote the nucleation
as well as the growth of NaH during dehydrogenation which significantly
accelerates the disintegration of NaAlH4 as suggested by
previous studies.20,47

It is likewise recommended
that the in situ formed catalyst indicates
higher catalytic activity and superior stability than those of the
externally added catalyst in view of the better homogeneity and finer
particle sizes.48 Hence, it is evidence
from the SEM result that the NaAlH4-doped K2NiF6 compound has smaller and finer particle sizes. These
smaller particle sizes give larger surface areas which can reduce
the diffusion length and improved the dehydrogenation kinetics as
well as lowering the onset decomposition temperature as reported in
the literature.49,50 Furthermore, it is believed that,
the establishment of the new active species may facilitate the dehydrogenation
process by functioning as the active sites for nucleation and growth
of the dehydrogenated product associated with the shortening of the
diffusion paths among the reaction ions and thus decreasing the kinetic
barriers and improving the dehydrogenation kinetics.51 Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the in situ
formed active species; AlNi, KH, and NaF will work simultaneously
and work synergistically for a significant enhancement on the hydrogen
storage properties of NaAlH4.

Conclusions
As
a conclusion, the addition of K2NiF6 has
successfully lowered the decomposition temperature and boosts the
kinetic performance of NaAlH4. The 5 wt % K2NiF6-doped compound gave the optimal value for the improvement
of the dehydrogenation properties of NaAlH4. The sample
doped with 5 wt % K2NiF6 started to release
hydrogen at 160 °C, which is 30 °C lower as compared to
the milled NaAlH4. The dehydrogenation kinetic revealed
that the doped sample showed faster hydrogen released, with 5 wt %
K2NiF6 can release about 1.5 wt % of hydrogen
in 30 min and at 150 °C. While the milled NaAlH4 only
released about 0.2 wt % within the same time and temperature. The
apparent activation energy calculated from Kissinger plots were reduced
from 114.7 and 125.2 kJ/mol for undoped NaAlH4 to 89.9
and 99.6 kJ/mol after being doped with K2NiF6 for the first and second-step of dehydrogenation, respectively.
In addition, the particles size also reduced and less agglomerated
with the addition of K2NiF6. This can help to
improve the hydrogen sorption of NaAlH4. These result demonstrated
that the active species that formed in situ, the AlNi, NaF, and KH
are responsible for the enhancement of the dehydrogenation properties
of NaAlH4.

Experimental Details
The commercial
starting materials, NaAlH4 (purity ≈
98%) and K2NiF6 (purity ≈ 99%) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich and were utilized without further treatment. All
handling of the samples were operated in a glovebox (MBraun Unilab)
with an argon atmosphere to avoid from humidity and oxygen. NaAlH4-doped with different wt % of K2NiF6 (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt %) were prepared via the planetary ball mill
(NQM-0.4). This process was conducted for 1 h with a rotation speed
of 400 rpm for three cycles in a different direction. Each of the
sample was sealed in stainless steel jars together with stainless
steel balls. Similarly, milled NaAlH4 was also prepared
in the same manner as a reference.

The decomposition temperature
and dehydrogenation kinetics of the
samples were investigated using a Sievert-type pressure-composition-temperature
equipment from Advanced Material Corporation. For the TPD experiment,
all the samples were heated to 300 °C at a heating rate of 5
°C/min. The isothermal dehydrogenation kinetics was conducted
at 150 °C under 30 atm hydrogen pressure. The DSC measurement
was conducted on Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 1. The samples were operated
at four different heating rates starting from room temperature to
the desired temperature with the influence of 50 mL/min of an argon
flow.

Characterizations of the samples were carried out using
a SEM (JEOL
JSM-6360LA). The phase compositions were characterized using an XRD
method with Cu Kα radiation (Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer).
The diffraction angle of the samples were scanned between 20 and 80°
at a scan speed of 2.00°/min. The FTIR measurement of the samples
after ball milled was recorded on the IRTracer-100 spectrophotometer
using attenuated total reflection in the transmission mode. The spectral
resolution was 4 cm–1 and the scans were taken from
750 to 4000 cm–1.
