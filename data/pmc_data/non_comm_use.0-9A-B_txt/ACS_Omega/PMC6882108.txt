A series of sustainable polymer blends from renewable
poly(lactic
acid) (PLA), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate)
(P3,4HB), and poly(epichlorohydrin-co-ethylene
oxide) (ECO) elastomer were fabricated via a melt blending method
to gain balanced physical performance. The interplay of the composition,
mutual miscibility, and viscosity ratio of the pristine PLA, P3,4HB, and ECO elastomer resulted in diverse phase structures
of the ternary blends. An excellent flexibility at an elongation of
270% was achieved for the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/20/10) blend
with a core–shell structure. The PLA/P3,4HB/ECO
(70/10/20) blend with a phase-separated structure exhibited a high
impact strength of 54 KJ/m2, which is 25 times over that
of the neat PLA. The relationship between the phase structure and
physical performance of the blend was analyzed based on the compositions,
surface tension, and physical characteristics of the neat components.
Combining the compatibilization of the P3,4HB phase and
ECO elastomer toughening played a crucial role in enhancing the mechanical
properties of the blends.

1 Introduction
Sustainable polymers derived
from biomass resources are gaining
increasing attention because of the concern over energy crisis and
environmental problems in recent years.1,2 Among the commercially
available bioplastics, biodegradable and renewable aliphatic polyesters
such as poly(lactic acid) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are considered
as the most promising alternatives to petroleum-based polymers in
many application areas. As a star renewable polyester, poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) is enjoying very fast growth in the market owing to its
attractive attributes such as high strength, good processability,
and large-scale availability at a competitive price. The application
of PLA has expanded from packaging to automotive and electric applications,
which are currently mainly dominated by the petroleum-based plastics.3−5 Yet, the poor impact resistance and flexibility are major hurdles
for the wide and diverse applications of PLA. Considerable efforts
have been devoted to toughening PLA via different strategies including
plasticization, copolymerization, blending, and composites.6−12 Blending PLA with ductile polymers to obtain highly toughened PLA-based
materials is a very facile method with the advantages of cost-effectiveness
and easy large-scale production.13−15 P3,4HB is
a new commercially available member of the PHA family synthesized
by microorganisms from renewable resources. Compared to other commercial
PHAs, the P3,4HB polymer has a lower degree of crystallinity
and lower melting temperature but better flexibility owing to the
introduction of 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB) comonomer unit in the main
chain. Consequently, P3,4HB has broad application prospects
ranging from biomedical to consumer products such as packaging. The
sustainable characteristics and complementary performance of the commercial
P3,4HB and PLA have aroused a lot of interest in their
binary blend to achieve fully renewable materials for wide applications.16−19 Unfortunately, because of limited miscibility between the PLA and
P3,4HB components, it is indeed very difficult to obtain
a desirable toughening effect for their simple binary blend.

Recently, a multiphase blend having more than two components was
proved to be a very effective strategy for PLA modification. Compared
to the simple binary blend, the multiphase blend has more complex
and diverse morphologies, a more excellent balance of properties,
and new functionalities. To achieve excellent toughness, Liu et al.
formulated PLA, ethylene methyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate (EMA-GMA),
and a commercial ionomer.20 Recently, Zhang
et al. reported a multiphase blend of sustainable PLA, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), and poly(butylene succinate)
(PBS) exhibiting complicated morphologies and synergistic physical
properties.21 Supertough PLA-based multiphase
blends from PLA, EMA-GMA, and biorenewable polyether block amide were
also reported by Zhang et al., which could be used as promising matrixes
for natural fibers to fabricate high-performance biocomposites.22−24 Recently, Ali et al. reported a series of PLA-based multiphase blends
with improved mechanical properties from PLA and other biobased polyesters
including PBS, poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)
(PBAT), etc.25,26 Mohanty et al. developed a series
of ternary blends including PLA/PBS/PBAT ternary blends and novel
reactive multiphase blends from Nylon 6, polypropylene, and PLA.27,28 Guo et al. adopted poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a compatibilizer
for a PLA/PBAT blend to achieve a highly toughened PLA-based blend.29 These previous works inspired us that fabricating
a multiphase blend from PLA and other components with complementary
properties is a very cost-effective, practical, and promising method
to obtain high-performance materials. However, to date, the petroleum-based
polymers are the most used modifying agents for the PLA and PHA blends
in the literature. It neither goes with the trend of bioeconomy nor
is it favorable for solving environmental problems. In this context,
developing renewable multiphase blends with high performances from
the biobased polymers is highly pursued for achieving sustainable
development goals.

Combining interfacial compatibilization and
toughening modification
is a key point for improving the properties of the multiphase PLA
blends.26−28 Using renewable elastomers having good compatibility
with the biopolyester matrixes as toughening agents will be a very
promising and effective method to achieve high-performance renewable
polyester-based multiphase blends. Poly(epichlorohydrin-co-ethylene oxide) copolymer (ECO), manufactured by the polymerization
process of epichlorohydrin and ethylene oxide monomers, is an important
commercial elastomer enjoying wide application areas such as automotive
and electronic applications. The polyether backbone coupled with side
bulky chlorine groups endows the ECO elastomer excellent performance
including good low-temperature flexibility and high resistance to
aging, weathering, and fuel. More importantly, the epichlorohydrin
monomer can now be commercially produced from glycerin, which is a
byproduct of the transformation of plant oils.30,31 Through their own patented glycerin-to-epichlorohydrin processes,
chemical companies such as Dow and Solvay have already supplied biobased
epichlorohydrin products from the biosourced glycerin in the market.
Based on this progress, biobased ECO rubber derived from the bioderived
epichlorohydrin shows huge potential and bright prospects. For example,
Toyota in collaboration with Zeon has made impressive progress in
producing the biobased ECO rubber (Biohydrin) for the usage of fuel-oil-resistant
applications of automobile gaskets, hose diaphragms, etc.

Considering
the encouraging progress in the biosourced ECO and
its excellent properties, the ECO elastomer is an ideal sustainable
modifying agent for enhancing the mechanical property of brittle polymers.32,33 We previously reported that the ECO elastomer could improve the
crystallization behavior and toughness of PLA even with only a limited
miscibility.32 More interestingly, the
ECO elastomer was also found to have very good miscibility with PHAs
such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) or PHBV.34−37 Given the environmental advantages,
good miscibility, and complementary properties of the PLA, P3,4HB, and ECO components, in this work, we focused on fabricating ternary
blends from the renewable PLA, P3,4HB, and ECO elastomer
to achieve fully renewable and toughening multiphase biobased polymer
blends. The miscibility, phase morphology, crystallization behavior,
and mechanical properties of the multiphase blends were thoroughly
studied to figure out the relationship between the phase structure
and physical property.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Miscibility of the Blends
Dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA) was first applied to characterize the mutual
miscibility of the three different components in present blends. Figure 1a shows the damping
factor (tan δ) for neat PLA; neat P3,4HB;
and binary blends from PLA, P3,4HB, and ECO. Neat PLA and
P3,4HB exhibit a glass transition at 76 and 11.8 °C,
respectively. Compared to that of the neat components, the transition
of each component shifts slightly close to each other for the binary
PLA/ECO blend, demonstrating a limited compatibility between PLA and
ECO phases. This result is in agreement with our previous report.32 It was reported that the PHB and PHBV having
similar functional groups as P3,4HB were miscible with
the ECO copolymer.34−36 Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that P3,4HB will also show good compatibility with the ECO copolymer.
As shown in Figure 1a, a little shift toward each other was observed for the P3,4HB/ECO (70/30) binary blends, suggesting that the P3,4HB and ECO phases have some compatibility. Several reports indicated
that PLA and P3,4HB were immiscible in their binary blend.17,18 However, as for the PLA/P3,4HB binary blends in the present
work, we find that the glass transition temperatures of the components
move more clearly toward each other compared to that of the PLA/ECO
and P3,4HB/ECO binary blends. This result implies that
the P3,4HB and PLA phases have better compatibility than
the PLA/ECO and P3,4HB/ECO blends. To further figure out
the miscibility between the components, Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on the neat polymer and their binary
blends, and the results are presented in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). For the PLA/ECO blend, the bands
ascribed to the C=O stretching modes of PLA slightly shifted
to higher regions, indicating some intermolecular interaction between
the PLA and ECO phases. In addition, the peaks became narrower, which
may be due to the improved crystallization of PLA in the presence
of ECO phases.32 It has been noted that
the carbonyl stretching region for PLA/P3,4HB is very complicated,
which is because of the crystallization of the components and possible
transesterification between the phases. However, an apparent shift
of the peaks to high wavenumbers was observed for the bands, suggesting
that the miscibility is attributed to interassociation between the
phases. As for the P3,4HB/ECO binary blend, an obvious
interassociation shoulder was exhibited in the spectra, demonstrating
good miscibility between the ECO and P3,4HB phases. The
interassociation may be attributed to interactions of the ester groups
of P3,4HB with the ether moieties and the chlorine group
of the ECH unit in the ECO copolymer.34−36

Figure 1 DMA traces of the samples:
(a) neat PLA, P3,4HB, and
binary blends, (b) ternary blends with various concentrations.

The partial miscibility of P3,4HB with
the PLA and ECO
phases suggests that the P3,4HB component can be utilized
as a potential compatibilizer for PLA and the ECO elastomer. Our speculation
is verified in the results of the following ternary blends. Figure 1b shows the DMA traces
of the ternary blends with various concentrations. The content of
P3,4HB showed an obvious influence on the miscibility among
the components in the blends. For the blend with a higher content
of P3,4HB, such as PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (45/45/10),
the tan δ peaks of the components shift toward each other
more apparently. This result demonstrates that the introduction of
P3,4HB improves the miscibility of PLA and ECO, which will
be beneficial to improve the toughening effect of the ECO elastomer
for the PLA matrix.

2.2 Phase Morphology of the Blend
Phase
behavior plays a very important role in determining the mechanical
property of polymer blends. Figures 2 and 3 present the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface of all of the blends.
In agreement with our previous report,32 a phase-separated structure is clearly observed for the PLA/ECO
binary blend with the ECO dispersing in the PLA matrix due to the
very limited miscibility of PLA and ECO. In contrast, for the P3,4HB/ECO and PLA/P3,4HB blends, the smaller size
of dispersed phases and a very unclear interface indicate the good
compatibility of the P3,4HB phase with both the PLA and
ECO phases. This result is also consistent with the DMA result. Figure 3 presents the SEM
micrographs of cryomicrotomed surfaces of the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO
ternary blends. The morphologies of two minor phases in PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/10/20) and PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/15/15)
blends are typical dispersed phase separation. The P3,4HB and ECO phases tend to separately disperse as particles in the
PLA matrix. With the content of P3,4HB increasing, there
is a trend to form a core–shell morphology. For example, although
a kind of mainly phase-separated structure is observed in Figure 3b,b′ for the
PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/15/15) formulation, a small amount of
composite-droplet structure can also be distinguished in the SEM image
(shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information).
Due to the composite-droplet structure, the core–shell particles
are prone to become bigger and uneven distribution. Interestingly,
the core–shell structure is more clearly observed in Figure 3c,c′ for the
PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/20/10) blend. One can clearly note the
composite-droplet structure with some holes from detaching of the
dispersed ECO particles. The PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (45/45/10)
blend presents a co-continuous phase structure of PLA and P3,4HB phases with the selective location of the ECO phase in the P3,4HB phases. Considering the better miscibility of P3,4HB/ECO pairs than that of PLA/ECO pairs and the low viscosity of
P3,4HB vs ECO and PLA, it is reasonable for the ECO phase
selectively locating in the P3,4HB phases. These phase
morphologies of the ternary blends are further confirmed in the complementary
SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of cryofracture surfaces
(shown in Figures S4 and S5, respectively).
Especially in the SEM images with high magnification of cryofracture
surfaces for the typical ternary blends (shown in Figure S4), one can clearly observe the composite-droplet
structure for the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/15/15) and PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/20/10) blends.

and (d, d′) PLA/P3,4HB/ECO 45/45/10.

The morphology of ternary blends is usually very
complex because
of different interfacial tensions and viscosity ratios between the
components.38 The spreading coefficient
model is widely adopted to predict the phase morphology of the multiphase
blends.39,40 Using the interfacial tensions between the
components, it can calculate the values of the spreading coefficient
according to the following equation proposed by Hobbs et al.41  λCB is the spreading coefficient
of C over B and αCB is the interfacial tension between
C and B. In polymer A, B, and C multiphase blend, taking A as the
matrix, if the value of λCB is positive, the component
B tends to be encapsulated by C. When both λCB and
λBC are negative, B and C will be predicted to form
a phase-separated structure. To figure out the morphology of the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO ternary blend, the spreading coefficient model was
applied to predict the morphology of the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO
blend. The interfacial tension can be calculated according to the
harmonic mean equation  based on the surface tension data listed in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting Information). Based
on these data, the interfacial value and spreading coefficient for
each polymer pairs at processing temperature were calculated and are
presented in Table 1. For the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/10/20) and PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/15/15) blends, the theoretical calculation results are
consistent with the actual morphologies shown in Figure 3. According to the calculations,
the P3,4HB and ECO particles tend to form dispersed phases
in the PLA matrix for the two PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/10/20)
and PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/15/15) formulations. However, the
calculated result is not in agreement with the core–shell structure
of the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/20/10) blend. In multiphase polymer
blends, interfacial tension is not the only factor controlling the
phase morphology. The melt viscosity and torque ratio of the components
are also very important and non-negligible factors in determining
the phase behavior.42 The theoretically
predicted morphologies are simply based on the static interfacial
tensions. Yet, in fact, the viscosity of each component will also
have a significant influence on the morphology. Even when the two
dispersed phases had equal compositions in ternary polymer blends,
it was reported that the dispersed phase with a lower viscosity tended
to form a shell encapsulating the other phase with a higher viscosity.43Figure 4 shows rheological curves of the PLA, P3,4HB, and
ECO components at the processing temperature. The ECO elastomer possesses
a much higher viscosity than P3,4HB at the processing shearing
rate. Consequently, considering the significantly lower viscosity
of P3,4HB compared to that of ECO and the higher content
of P3,4HB in the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/20/10) formulation,
it is reasonable that the P3,4HB phase with the lower viscosity
tends to encapsulate the ECO phases, thus forming the core–shell
structures. In addition, since it is a dynamic and nonequilibrium
thermodynamic process, these core–shell-structured particles
with polydisperse sizes are found to be unevenly distributed in the
PLA matrix of the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/20/10) formulation.
The lower viscosity of P3,4HB may be due to the poor thermal
stability during the melt-processing above 170 °C. Doi et al.
had pointed out P3,4HB was thermally unstable and its molecular
weight decreased rapidly with time at temperatures above 170 °C.44 During the processing at high temperature above
160 °C, random chain scission at ester groups will occur for
the P3,4HB phase.44 Consequently,
melt-processing below 160 °C is preferable for P3,4HB to avoid its thermal degradation. However, this processing temperature
is unfortunately unsuitable for the present PLA/P3,4HB/ECO
system. The poor thermal stability will also have a negative impact
on the mechanical performance of P3,4HB and its blend.

2.3 Mechanical Properties
Figure 5a presents the tensile properties
of the pristine PLA, P3,4HB, and binary blends. Neat PLA
is a typically rigid and brittle plastic with a high tensile strength
of up to 68 MPa and low elongation below 20%. Compared to PLA, neat
P3,4HB is a relatively flexible polymer with a lower strength
of 23 MPa and better elongation up to 30%. As reported in our previous
report, the ECO elastomer was proved to be a good toughening agent
for PLA.32 Addition of 30 wt % ECO improves
the elongation of PLA to 100% yet greatly deceases the strength to
30 MPa. Blending 30 wt % ECO with P3,4HB significantly
enhances the flexibility of the neat P3,4HB with the elongation
increasing to 550% and the strength decreasing up to 15 MPa. However,
the binary blends of PLA and P3,4HB show no obvious improvement
in tensile properties compared to the neat polymer.

Figure 5 Tensile stress–strain
curves: (a) neat PLA, P3,4HB, and the binary blends; (b)
ternary blends with various concentrations.

Figure 5b presents
the tensile properties of the ternary blends. Compared to the pristine
components and binary blends, all of the ternary blends show a better-balanced
tensile performance. For the ternary blends with PLA as the matrix,
a significant enhancement in flexibility is observed with a higher
value of elongation. Moreover, one can note that all of the ternary
blends show higher tensile strengths compared to the binary blends.
The elongation of the ternary blends is found to increase with the
increasing content of P3,4HB. The PLA/P3,4HB/ECO
(70/20/10) formulation shows the best tensile property with a tensile
strength of 36.5 MPa and an elongation of 270%, which is almost 15
times higher than that of the neat PLA. It is well known that the
compatibility and morphology of the different phases in blends play
vital roles in determining their mechanical performance. As mentioned
above, the P3,4HB component improves the miscibility of
the phases, which will be beneficial for improving the tensile properties
of the ternary blends. The good toughening effect of the ECO elastomer
and the improved compatibility from the P3,4HB component
have a good synergistic effect on improving the flexibility of the
blends. The PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (45/45/10) blend with a co-continuous
structure obtains only a limited improvement in tensile properties
compared to the neat PLA and other formulations. This may be caused
by the thermal degradation of P3,4HB, which will deteriorate
the mechanical property of the component and the blends. As revealed
in Figure S2, thermogravimetric analyses
(TGA) results clearly suggest that the P3,4HB phase has
a very poor thermal stability at high processing temperature. It will
have a negative effect on the physical properties. Consequently, too
high content of the P3,4HB component in the ternary blend
will adversely affect the mechanical properties. The results also
suggest that finding an effective way for enhancing the thermal stability
of P3,4HB and PLA during the melt-processing is very important
to further improve the tensile property of the present ternary blend.

Figure 6 shows the
Charpy impact strength of the samples. Neat PLA shows an impact strength
of only around 2 KJ/m2 in a clearly brittle broken pattern.
In contrast to the tensile property of the neat P3,4HB,
the impact strength of P3,4HB is only at 1.4 KJ/m2, which is even worse than that of the neat PLA. The poor thermal
stability and low content of 4HB are considered as the main reasons
for the poor toughness of the neat P3,4HB.45 The ECO elastomer was proved to be a very effective toughening
agent for the brittle polymer like PLA.32 The impact strength of PLA/ECO (70/30) blends is extremely high
up to 55 KJ/m2. Although ECO has a certain degree of compatibility
with P3,4HB, the impact property of the P3,4HB/ECO binary blend enjoys only a limited enhancement with an impact
strength of 8 KJ/m2. As for the ternary blends, the impact
strength is remarkably improved compared to the pristine PLA. In the
ternary blends, the ECO elastomer is considered as the main contribution
to absorb the impact energy. The impact strength increases with increasing
of the ECO contents in the ternary blends. The PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/10/20) blend shows a significant increase in impact strength
to 54 KJ/m2, which is 25 times over that of the neat PLA.
Inconsistent with the tensile test results, the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/20/10) formulation with a core–shell structure
has only a very limited improvement in the impact strength. The unsatisfied
toughening effect may be ascribed to the very poor impact strength
of the neat P3,4HB during the high-speed impact test, which
is inconsistent with the tensile property at a slowly constant tensile
rate. High content of P3,4HB tends to result in a more
adverse effect for the high-speed impact test. On the contrary, the
ECO particle is more facile to transfer energy in dispersed-phase
morphology than the core–shell phase morphology. In general,
the content of the ECO in the ternary blends is the key factor in
the impact behavior (Figure 7).

2.4 Impact Fracture Surface Morphology
The impact strength of the blend is strongly affected by the interfacial
adhesion, size, and dispersion of the disperse phase.21,26 Favorable interfacial compatibility and a good distribution of the
dispersed phases in the matrix play significant roles in toughening
the blend. Aiming to figure out the native toughening mechanism in
the blends, SEM was used to observe the morphology of the impact fracture
surface of the samples. As shown in Figure 8, a typical brittle fracture behavior is
observed for the pristine PLA: a very smooth surface without much
deformation. The fracture surfaces of the PLA/ECO blend are rugged
in agreement with its higher impact strength. Although the phase interfaces of rubber particles and PLA matrix
can be distinguished due to their limited compatibility with PLA,
the ECO elastomer still can effectively improve the toughness of PLA.
As for the P3,4HB/ECO blend, a relatively smooth surface
is observed with no distinct phase separation, which is mainly because
of the poor toughness of neat P3,4HB. Although ECO has
better compatibility with P3,4HB than PLA, the toughening
effect of the ECO elastomer for P3,4HB may be greatly compromised
by the thermal degradation of the P3,4HB component due
to its poor thermal stability. For the PLA/P3,4HB binary
blends, the surface exhibits moderate roughness with a little matrix
deformation.

Figure 8 SEM images of the impact fracture surfaces of the binary
blend
and PLA/P3,4HB/ECO blend with various compositions.

Compared to those of the binary blend, more and
longer fibrils
and threads are noticed in the ternary blends, which is clear evidence
for the ductile fractures. Especially for the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO
(70/10/20) blend, a very rough surface can be observed in the impact
fracture surface owing to the PLA matrix deformation, which will absorb
a large amount of fracture energy during the impact test. In recent
reports of PLA-based ternary blends, the relationship between the
interfacial structure and physical property had stimulated intensive
research interest as a guide for the fabrication of high-performance
PLA. Most of the reports focused on the interfacial structure including
interfacial layer thickness, interfacial dispersion, and interfacial
adhesion.26−29 However, our results indicate that the native physical properties
of the interfacially located components also have a non-negligible
influence on the performance. For the ternary blends with a kind of
soft and tough rubber at the interface of PLA and the third component,
an excellent toughening effect will be achieved, for example, the
recently reported PLA/EMA-GMA/Pebax and PLA/EMA-GMA/LLDPE ternary
blends.22,26 However, for the ternary blends using a
brittle polymer at the interface, the composition of the interfacially
located polymer has a complicated influence on the toughening efficiency.
For example, in a PLA ternary blend using brittle PMMA as the interfacial
component, it was reported that low content of PMMA showed a positive
toughening effect, while the toughening effect decreased for the high
composition of PMMA.29 In the present work,
although P3,4HB locating at the interface improves the
compatibility of PLA and ECO phases, the poor toughness of P3,4HB still plays a negative role in the toughening effect, especially
for the impact strength. As shown in the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO
(70/20/10) formulation with a core–shell structure, it has
a limited toughening efficiency compared to the other two PLA/P3,4HB/ECO ternary formulations with phase-separated structures.
To gain a satisfied toughening effect, it is better to carefully select
interfacial components with good flexibility and toughness beside
the good compatibilization. As for the present PLA/P3,4HB/ECO ternary system, the key point to achieve a better toughening
effect is finding an efficient strategy to enhance the thermal stability
of the P3,4HB component at high processing temperature.

2.5 Thermal and Crystallization Behavior
In the present multiphase blend, PLA and P3,4HB are typical
semicrystalline polyesters. Their physical properties are greatly
influenced by the crystallization behavior and crystal structure.
Accordingly, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WAXD) were employed to characterize the thermal
behavior and crystalline structure of the multiphase system, respectively. Figure 9 presents the melting
behavior of the neat PLA, P3,4HB, ECO, and their binary
and ternary blends after quenching. As shown in Figure 9a, no obvious shift is observed for the glass
transition temperature of PLA in the PLA/ECO (70/30) binary blend
resulting from the limited miscibility between the two components.
However, the cold crystallization peak of PLA is clearly observed
to become sharper compared to that of the neat PLA. The Tcc of PLA shifts from 125.2 °C for neat PLA to a
low temperature of 104.1 °C in the PLA/ECO (70/30) blend, indicating
that the ECO phase accelerates the cold crystallization of PLA. Based
on the ΔHc and ΔHm data of PLA, the degree of crystallinity of PLA in the
PLA/ECO (70/30) blend increases to 5.2% compared to the neat PLA with
a value of 3.4%. The ECO phases played a role of nucleating agents
for the PLA matrix, which is inconsistent with our previous report.32 Yet, for the P3,4HB/ECO (70/30) blend,
the glass transition temperature of P3,4HB is found to
move from −6.8 °C toward the low temperature of −9.7
°C of the binary blend. This phenomenon agreed well with the
DMA result, which further proves that the P3,4HB and ECO
phases show partial miscibility. In addition, one can note that the
crystallization peak of P3,4HB shifts a little toward high
temperature. These results suggest that the ECO phases have a dilution
effect, which will confine the cold crystallization of the P3,4HB phases owing to the partial miscibility. At the same time, the
thermal degradation of P3,4HB also plays a negative role
in its crystallization ability because of the poor thermal stability
of P3,4HB. As for the binary PLA/P3,4HB blends,
the glass transition of PLA unfortunately overlapped with the cold
crystallization of the P3,4HB phase, which makes it be
difficult to be analyzed. However, compared to that of the neat PLA,
the cold crystallization peak of PLA in the PLA/P3,4HB
(70/30) and (30/70) binary blends is clearly observed to shift toward
the lower-temperature range, illustrating that P3,4HB promotes
the cold crystallization of PLA. The enhanced crystallization of PLA
will be helpful for keeping the strength of the blends with soft elastomers.
At the same time, one can also note that the presence of the PLA phase
restricts the cold crystallization of P3,4HB with the Tcc of P3,4HB moving to a higher temperature
region. These phenomena in crystallization of the binary PLA/P3,4HB blend also demonstrate the compatibility of the components
of PLA and P3,4HB. Figure 9b shows the thermal behavior of the ternary system.
Except for PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (45/45/10), all of the other
ternary formulations mainly show the thermal behavior of the PLA matrix.
In the ternary blends, the presence of P3,4HB and ECO phase
enhanced the cold crystallization of the PLA matrix. Moreover, it
is found that the Tcc of PLA shifts to
a lower-temperature region with the content of P3,4HB increasing
due to the improved compatibility. Figure 10 shows the crystallization curves of the
PLA binary and ternary blends at a cooling rate of 2 °C/min from
the melt. As shown in Figure 10a, for the neat polymers and their binary blends, the ECO
phase plays a different role in the crystallization of neat PLA and
P3,4HB in the binary blends. For PLA, the ECO phases play
as nucleating agents for the crystallization of PLA, resulting in
the Tc of PLA shifting to high temperature
and an obvious crystallization peak. In contrast, the crystallization
temperature (Tc) of P3,4HB
moves slightly to low temperature in the P3,4HB/ECO binary
blend because of the dilution effect of the ECO phase. As for the
PLA/P3,4HB binary blends, P3,4HB improves the
crystallization of PLA from the melt state. For the ternary blends
shown in Figure 10b, the crystallization temperature (Tc) of PLA in the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/10/20) and (70/15/15)
formulations shifts to a high-temperature region and becomes sharp
because of the nucleating effect of phase-separated ECO and P3,4HB phases. However, for the PLA/P3,4HB/ECO (70/20/10)
formulation with a core–shell structure, the nucleating effect
is compromised due to the decrease in the number of dispersed-phase
particles given the ECO phase being encapsulated by the P3,4HB phase. Moreover, the uneven distribution and heterogeneous particles
with the core–shell structure also lead to the complicated
crystallization behavior of PLA exhibiting complicated and multiple
wide peaks.

and binary

Figure 11 shows
the crystal structure of the samples characterized by WAXD. The neat
PLA shows two sharp peaks at 2θ = 16.7 and 19.0. These peaks
are corresponding to the (200/110) and (203) planes of the orthorhombic
unit cell, respectively.19,32 The neat P3,4HB exhibits three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 13.4, 19.9, and
25.4, which are ascribed to the diffraction peaks (020), (021), and
(031/131), respectively.16,19 The characteristic
peaks of each component exist in all of the blends. The characteristic
peaks of PLA are observed to become sharp owing to the nucleating
effect of ECO and P3,4HB phases. However, no new peaks
appear for all of the blends, indicating that the PLA and P3,4HB crystallized separately in the blends without changing the crystal
structure.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we formulated
a renewable multiphase blend system
by blending PLA with the renewable P3,4HB and the ECO elastomer
to achieve an excellent balanced mechanical property. The presence
of P3,4HB improved the compatibility of the PLA matrix
and ECO phase. A variety of structures including phase separation,
core–shell, and co-continuous phase morphologies were tuned
by optimizing the blend composition, mutual miscibility, and viscosity
ratio of the components. A significant improvement in flexibility
with an elongation at 270% was obtained for PLA/P3,4HB/ECO
(70/20/10) with a core–shell structure. A supertough PLA/P3,4HB/ECO ternary blend was achieved by blending 10 wt % P3,4HB and 20 wt % ECO in PLA with an impact strength of 45
KJ/m2. Combining compatibilization and elastomer toughening
coupled with the influence of the native property of the interfacial
component played a vital role in enhancing the properties of the blends.
To further enhance the mechanical performance, improving the thermal
stability of P3,4HB is very important for the present multiphase
system.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Poly(lactic acid) (Ingeo
PLA, 3001D) with an L-content of 98.5%, a weight-average molecular
weight (Mw) of 1.7 × 105, and a density of 1.25 g/cm3 was purchased from Nature
Works Inc. Poly(epichlorohydrin-co-ethylene oxide)
(ECO, Epichlomer C, 49 mol% epichlorohydrin unit) was purchased from
Osaka Soda Co., Ltd, Japan. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P3,4HB) with a Mw of 2.6 × 106 and 4HB of approximately
8 mol% (characterized by GPC and 1H NMR) was obtained from
Tianjin Green Biomaterial Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).

4.2 Preparation of Blends
PLA, P3,4HB, and ECO were vacuum-dried at 60 °C for at least
24 h prior to processing. PLA/P3,4HB/ECO blends with different
compositions were melt-processed in a Haake internal mixer (Rheomix
600, Germany) with a barrel volume of 69 cm3. The blends
were mixed at 180 °C for at least 5 min at a screw speed of 60
rpm. To ensure the same thermal history, the neat PLA and P3,4HB were also subjected to the same mixing treatment.

4.3 Characterizations
Dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA) was performed on a TA Instrument (DMA Q800) in a single-cantilever
mode with a frequency of 1 Hz and an amplitude of 15 μm. At
least three samples (30 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm) were tested from
−80 to 125 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C/min to ensure
the reproducibility.

The Charpy impact strength of the samples
was measured using a GOTECH pendulum impact tester according to the
ISO178 standard. The notched impact samples were obtained by the Haake
MiniJet machine. According to the ISO 527-1 standard, the tensile
property of the samples was tested using a universal tensile testing
machine at a tensile rate of 10 mm/min. Five replicates were conducted
to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility.

Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) characterization was performed
using a TA Q2000 thermal analysis system under a N2 atmosphere.
First, the samples were heated from 25 to 180 °C at a rate of
10 °C/min and cooled to −80 °C at 30 °C/min
after holding the temperature for 3 min. The next scan was heated
to 180 °C at 10 °C/min and cooled to −80 °C
at 2 °C/min. Finally, the samples were heated to 180 °C
at 10 °C/min after maintaining the temperature for 3 min. The
glass transition temperature (Tg), cold
crystallization temperature (Tcc′),
crystallization temperature (Tc), and
melting temperature (Tm) were obtained
from the curves.

The morphology of the blends was observed by
scanning electron
microscope (SEM) on a Hitachi S4800 SEM under an accelerating voltage
of 10 kV. The cryofractured samples were prepared after being cooled
in liquid nitrogen for at least 30 min and then dried at 40 °C
in a vacuum. Then, the samples were fastened using a conductive paint
on a specimen holder and sputtered with gold before fractographic
examinations. The impact fracture surfaces of the samples were also
characterized by SEM.

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements
were carried out
using a D8 Advance Diffractometer (Bruker, Germany). The angle range
was set at 5–40° at 3°/min.

Thermogravimetric
analyses (TGA) were carried out at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min in a TA Instrument Q50 using a temperature
range of 25–700 °C in nitrogen.

The rheological
measurements were carried out on TA instrument
HR-2. The frequency sweep for the samples was carried out under nitrogen
at 180 °C using a 25 mm plate–plate geometry. The samples
were prepared by melt-pressed method at 180 °C with 1 mm thick.
The strain range was 5%, and the angular frequency range in the test
was 0.01–600 rad/s.

Contact angles were measured by the
POWEREACH Contact Angle Testing
Machine. PLA, P3,4HB, and ECO samples were dissolved in
chloroform and then spin-coated on a cover glass (24 mm × 32
mm). All samples were dried at 40 °C in a vacuum oven for at
least 12 h. The contact angles were measured in 50 μL of the
wetting solvent at 25 °C, and the mean values of five reduplicates
were reported.

The 1H NMR spectra were recorded with
a 400 MHz Bruker
AVANCE III spectrometer with reference to the solvent residual signal
(1H NMR, DMSO-d6 2.5 ppm) at
room temperature.

The FTIR measurements were carried out using
an attenuated total
reflectance (ATR) model on an IR Tracer-100 spectrometer (Shimadzu)
at room temperature. All of the samples at 1 mm thickness were directly
measured in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm–1 with 32 scans.

For AFM, the MultiMode 8 AFM system from Bruker
Nano Inc., CA,
was used. Image processing and data analysis were performed using
the Nanoscope Analysis software. Imaging in the tapping mode and peak
force tapping (PFT) mode was done with RTESPA Si cantilevers with
a spring constant of 40 N/m (Bruker AFM probes, CA) in air. Peak force
quantitative nanomechanical property mapping (PF-QNM) AFM was carried
out at a constant oscillation of the sample at 2 kHz using an amplitude
of 150 nm. The specimens for AFM imaging were prepared by cryomicrotoming
with a tungsten knife to create a perfect plane face using a Leica
Microtome, Germany, equipped with a cryochamber
