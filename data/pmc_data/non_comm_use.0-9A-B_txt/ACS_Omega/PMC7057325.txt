The human body releases heat via
four mechanisms: conduction, convection,
evaporation, and radiation. The normal core temperature of the human
body is around 37 °C, and metabolism may be negatively affected
and enzymes/proteins may be destroyed if the core temperature rises
above 45 °C. To prevent such overheating, we developed an evaporative–radiative–convective
fabric which can control the personal microclimate of the human body
through a cooling mechanism (evaporation of perspiration, air convection,
and emission of heat radiation directly into the environment). In
this work, we fabricated a thermo–moisture sensitive polyurethane/silica
aerogel composite membrane which showed super evaporative and radiative
effects and which can facilitate the convection process in the human
body. We also fabricated a sensitive membrane-based textile which
can cool down the human body by releasing body heat. The developed
material possessed robust mechanical properties for the longevity
of the material, high water-evaporative ability, and air permeability
to provide comfort to the wearer. Microclimate-controlled clothing
can release most of our body heat to the environment.

1 Introduction
Climate
change is one of the fundamental challenges for human civilization,
with the current challenge being to keep global warming below a rise
of 2 °C. To keep within this limit, deployment of negative emissions
technologies is required.1,2 According to the Hong
Kong Observatory, climate change is making Hong Kong warmer; it was
reported that the temperature and relative humidity during the summer
could be around 35.4 °C and 95%, respectively. Such hot weather
can have a negative impact on the human body, such as heat stroke,
dehydration, elevated heart rate, and so forth.3,4 Personal
cooling technology could play a vital role in controlling body heat
in hot environments.

The requirement for a personal microclimate
controlling system
has existed for a long time. Active cooling, passive cooling, and
combo cooling are the three major types of cooling process. Combo
cooling is the combination of active and passive cooling. Active cooling
includes ventilated air cooling such as liquid supplies or external
air connections; active cooling reduces both thermoregulatory and
cardiovascular strain.5−9 Phase-change materials act as passive cooling materials and can
reduce thermal stress and improve thermal comfort.10 Thermophysiological comfort is the ideal state between
the environmental atmosphere and physical and emotional harmony of
the body.11 Thermoregulation is the biological
process which keeps the body temperature within the correct range
when the outdoor temperature can vary. If the human body cannot maintain
a normal core temperature and it increases significantly above normal
temperature, then hyperthermia can occur when the core temperature
rises above 45 °C. During hyperthermia, proteins and enzymes
may be destroyed, which can lead to death. On the contrary, when the
core temperature decreases below normal temperature, then hypothermia
occurs at a core temperature lower than 35 °C. Hypothermia can
slow the metabolism process of the human body. During exercise, the
body’s ability of thermoregulation is affected. Metabolism
(metabolism maintains the reactions which occur in the human body)
produces heat as a byproduct. The human body is 25% efficient; therefore,
we lose approximately 75% of energy as heat.12,13 According to Guyton and Hall, the hypothalamus in the brain controls
the body temperature.14

The hypothalamus
responds to different temperature receptors in
the body; it uses thermophysiological adjustment to maintain a comfortable
core temperature. For example, when the surroundings are hot, the
skin will pass the signal on to the hypothalamus to adjust the core
temperature by increasing radiation through the sweat rate (evaporation),
convection, and conduction. The heat exchange between the human body
and the environment plays an important role in the body’s thermoregulation.15−17 The human body releases heat by evaporation, radiation, conduction,
and convection. Sweat evaporation is one effective way by which to
cool the human body; evaporation of sweat from the skin to the environment
provides effective body cooling for individuals exposed to hot/dry
environments.18 Heat from the skin converts
sweat (water) to sweat vapor, and body heat can be released by sweating.
In high-intensity heat, the human body loses up to 1 L of sweat per
hour. Temperature and relative humidity play a key role in controlling
the sweating level. Water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and
chloride) produce sweat; the hypothalamus in the brain senses when
the core temperature is high and responds by stimulating the sweat
glands to maintain a normal core body temperature. The emission of
radiation is the most effective way to release heat from the skin
into the environment; most of the body heat is released by radiation.
Tong et al. developed an infrared (IR)-transparent–visible-opaque
fabric which provides passive cooling through the transmission of
thermal radiation from the body to the environment.19 It does not provide evaporative and convective behavior,
which is related to thermoregulation of the human body. Hsu et al.
demonstrated nanoporous polyethylene (nanoPE) which is transparent
to mid-IR human body radiation but opaque to visible light because
of the pore size distribution. They then developed a textile that
promotes effective radiative cooling;20 however, the mechanical properties of nanoPE are inferior compared
to those of PE or cotton. For thermal comfort of the human body, air
conditioning (convection) plays a vital role. A significant amount
of body heat can be transferred to the environment by convection.
Convective cooling of the human body in hot weather improves thermal
comfort,21 and convective cooling facilitates
the hypothalamus to control core temperature. Nowadays, most people
keep their house warm in winter and cool in summer via air conditioning;
however, this consumes a lot of energy.22,23 Passive personal
body cooling may be a better solution to overcome such a problem.
Currently, there are several personal body cooling clothing materials
available on the market. However, such clothing is fabricated for
high performance applications, such as protective clothing and sports
clothing, which are not suitable for regular use.24−27

According to the definition
of thermoregulating textile, it is
a textile which helps regulate the inner temperature of a textile
by releasing or absorbing heat energy as the ambient temperature changes.28−30 In this study, we mainly focused on the releasing heat of the human
body through the textile as the surrounding temperature increased.
Therefore; we developed an evaporative–radiative–convective
fabric (ERCF) that provides passive cooling by means of evaporation
of perspiration, air convection, and emission of radiation directly
into the environment. The microclimate-control fabric plays a very
vital role in controlling human body temperature by transferring body
heat into the environment in different ways during the summer season
when the surrounding temperature is too high (Figure 1A–D). One of these methods is evaporation;
the prepared composite membrane was super evaporative, and most textile
fibers are either water absorbent or resistant, but the ERCF we prepared
is water vapor permeable. Therefore, this kind of evaporative behavior
may provide evaporative cooling to the wearer. A limited range of
body heat can be transported from the skin into the environment by
air convection; the ERCF has air permeability (AP) behavior which
can provide air convection to the human body. When there is no wind,
convective cooling occurs by temperature or density difference, which
can be called “free convection”. Usually, convective
cooling during high speed winds is better for comparing temperature
or density difference. Emission of radiation is the most effective
way to release body heat, transporting the heat via electromagnetic
waves. Radiative cooling provides an effective way to surpass conventional
ways of microclimate controlling. Radiative thermal management can
be achieved by controlling transmissivity, emissivity, and reflectivity.31−34 The ERCF provides the necessary body cooling for an individual to
feel comfortable at different temperature levels. The proposed super
evaporative composite membrane was prepared using a hydrophilic segmented
polyurethane (PU) solution along with hollow silica aerogel. Different
weight percentages of silica aerogel were added (0.5 & 1 wt %,
named composite 0.5% & composite 1%, respectively). This kind
of responsive PU has the capability to respond to specific changes
in its surroundings (temperature and relative humidity). Hydrophilic
segmented PU is composed of soft (polyol) and hard segments (di-isocyanate
and chain extender). Soft segment (polyol) is the responsive part
of the PU and the hard segment gives the PU its mechanical properties.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
4,4-Methylene(di-isocyanate)
(MDI), polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 1000 g/mol), 1,4-butanediol
(BDO), and N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMAc) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (USA). Silica aerogel particles
(size—10 μm) were obtained from Hengqiu Graphene Technology
(Suzhou) Co., Ltd.

2.2 Synthesis of PU
Synthesis of PU was
carried out in a two-step process. First, the macroglycol (PEG) was
taken in a three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a thermometer,
mechanical stirrer, and vacuum pump. PEG was degassed at 80 °C
for 1 h under vacuum. Then, MDI was added to degassed PEG and the
reaction was continued at 80 °C for 2.5 h. At the second stage,
the chain extender (BDO) was added to this prepolymer and vigorously
stirred to obtain segmented PU. The synthesis procedure of PU is shown
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 The fabrication
process of PU and composite membranes.

2.3 Preparation of the Composite Membrane
Different
percentages (0.5 and 1%) of silica particles were incorporated
to fabricate the PU composite. The silica particle was added into
the PU solution (DMAc was used as the solvent) and mixed by mechanical
stirring for 30 min for homogeneous mixing. After that, sonication
was performed in order to properly mix the silica particles in the
PU matrix. The final PU composite membrane was obtained from a melt
blowing machine. The thickness of the fabricated membrane was about
25–28 μm.

2.4 Fabric Details and Lamination
Scoured,
bleached, and dyed 100% cotton fabrics were used in the twill weaving
structure, and then, the fabric samples were cut into size 500 ×
500 mm before laminating. The used fabric was −115 g/sq m and
2/2 twill fabric. The twill line can be seen from both sides of the
fabric. Then these fabrics were laminated with composite membranes
by using a hot press. A Digital Knight 20 16″ × 20″
digital clamshell was used for the lamination. The temperature was
kept at 150 °C for the lamination and then cooled down at room
temperature.

2.5 Characterization
2.5.1 Water Vapor Transmission
Water
vapor transmission tests were conducted in a climate chamber according
to ASTM E96 BW standard by using a Haida International Equipment instrument
(Model-HD-E702-100-4). It is a temperature-, relative humidity-, and
air velocity-controlled climate chamber. Tests were conducted at different
temperatures and relative humidities. The air velocity in the chamber
was 0.2–0.03 m/s. The test cup was half filled with water and
the laminated sample was fixed on the top of the cup with grease.
The test cup was placed into the test chamber for 4 h and then weight
change was taken to calculate the WVT rate using the following eq 1. 1  where G is the weight change
in grams, t is the duration of the test in hour,
and A is the test area in m2.

2.5.2 Air Permeability
To observe the
breathability of the membrane, the AP testing of the laminated fabric
was performed according to ASTM D737-96 by using SDL international
textile testing equipment.

2.5.3 IR Transmittance
The IR transmittance
of the membranes was tested by using Fourier transform IR spectroscopy
with a PerkinElmer model Spectrum 100. The spectra of the membrane
were recorded in the range of 2–18 and 7–14 μm.

2.5.4 Mechanical Property
The mechanical
properties (strength and elongation at break) of the samples were
tested according to ASTM D882 standard using an Instron 4411 (Boston,
MA, USA). The samples were cut into 100 × 10 mm (L × W) squares. Tests were performed at room
temperature (25 °C).

2.5.5 Absorbency
The
water absorbency
of the membrane was measured in order to check the absorbability of
different membranes. Testing time 4 h and condition were recorded.
Absorbability was calculated according to eq 2 2  

2.5.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
surface morphology of the membrane was observed by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) with a TESCAN VEGA3. The cross-section of the above-mentioned
specimens was further investigated to determine the changes in the
fiber morphology and fabric properties.

2.5.7 Abrasion
Resistance
For checking
the hardness and adhesion properties of the laminated fabric, we have
carried out a Martindale abrasion resistance test of the laminated
sample according to ASTM D4966 standard; we rubbed it 1000 times (50
per min) with 9 kPa load on the upper surface, and under the lower
surface, there was a plain twill fabric. After testing, we investigated
the sample and found very good abrasion resistance properties, which
means that it has very good adhesion properties.

2.5.8 Wicking Test
The wicking test was
performed according to AAATCC TM 197. The test samples were cut into
2 cm wide stripe and dipped into distilled water. Then, the water
started to climb up the testing sample due to capillary force.

3 Results and Discussion
Hydrophilic silica
aerogels are nanoporous and of low density with
an open pore structure. Highly porous three-dimensional silica aerogel
networks (Figure 3A,B)
contain some extraordinary properties, such as low thermal conductivity
(∼0.02 W/mK) and high specific surface area (450–950
m2/g). Porous silica aerogel contains lots of hydroxyl
(−OH) groups on its backbone (Figure 3C), and such structures have led to silica
aerogels being used in a wide variety of scientific and industrial
applications.33−36 After making the composite membrane, we laminated (Figure 3D) it with woven fabric (cotton).
These hydroxyl (−OH) groups on the silica aerogel facilitate
the achievement of water vapor permeability of the composite membrane.
A self-adaptive water vapor permeability membrane has many applications
such as laminated textiles, gas separation, food packaging, and wound
dressing.37,38 Porous skin covers the human body, which
perspires all the time; it contains more than 60% of water at normal
core temperature (36–37 °C). It would be a crucial property
of a textile to have the ability to transport such perspiration from
the body surface to the environment for controlling the thermophysiological
comfort of the human body. Thermal comfort is controlled by body sweat
in the vapor form and its transmission from inside the fabric to the
environment. The sweat glands begin the production of perspiration,
while heat transmission from the skin to the environment decreases.
Normally, body sweat in the vapor form is termed insensible perspiration
and body sweat in the liquid form is termed sensible perspiration.11 When perspiration is transported from the skin
to the environment, it contains body heat, thus adjusting the body
heat level. If the water vapor transmitting ability rate is low or
limited, then it increases body temperature and causes heat stress
in hot environments. Water vapor permeability through fabric plays
a significant role in adjusting body comfort in both hot and cold
environments or during high activity levels. To provide wearing comfort,
the fabric should have a high level of WVT so that body sweat can
evaporate and be transmitted from the skin to the environment.

nm), (B) structure of silica aerogel, (C) schematic of hollow silica

Nowadays, energy-efficient
and environmentally friendly cooling
systems are receiving huge attention. Air conditioning systems consume
more energy, and to reduce the energy consumption of air conditioning
systems, evaporative cooling can be a better alternative.39,40 Evaporative cooling is the reduction of heat by evaporation of perspiration;
this moves latent heat from the skin into the environment. Evaporative
cooling is different from typical air conditioning; in evaporative
cooling, the water absorbs a huge amount of latent heat during evaporation.
When the core temperature of the body increases, the hypothalamus
attempts to control the core temperature by releasing heat through
perspiration, and body heat loss by perspiration increased with increasing
temperature, while human body radiation decreased with increasing
temperature and sweating.41 To pass this
perspiration from the surface of the body into the environment, we
have developed an evaporative cooling fabric (Figure 4A–E); the relationship between WVT,
temperature, and relative humidity is shown in Figure 4F. Cotton is
a highly water-absorbing cellulosic material; the moisture absorption
rate of cotton is around 7–8%. To make the evaporative cooling
fabric, we laminated the cotton-weaved fabric via a highly evaporative
thermo–moisture-responsive PU composite membrane. The composite
membrane was prepared by adding hydrophilic hollow silica aerogel
with PU. Segmented hydrophilic PU was synthesized, and then, the super
moisture-absorbent hollow silica aerogel was added in order to make
a highly evaporative film. Our composite membrane and laminated fabric
have a high water vapor permeability property to control the personal
microclimate of the human body, as shown in Figure 4D; composite 1% has better WVT (1859 g m–2 d–1) than PU alone (1065 g m–2 d–1) or cotton fabric (1190 g m–2 d–1) at 40 °C temperature.
Furthermore, WVT of composite 1% is 859 (g m–2 d–1), while PU has only 440 (g m–2 d–1) at 90% relative humidity (Figure 4E). This type of microclimate-controlled
cooling fabric has been developed to minimize body heat-related diseases
such as heat stroke and other heat-related injuries in extreme weather.
A hot environment reduces the working efficiency of the body. Evaporation
of perspiration is an extremely effective way by which to cool the
body in a hot environment. Moreover, when the core temperature of
the body increases, it directly influences physical performance and
metabolism. Uncontrolled metabolism can cause serious physical defects
and cause the body to work inefficiently. Research has shown that
if human thermoregulation can be controlled and body efficiency increased,
then the risk of heat-related diseases is limited. Personal cooling
fabrics can enhance working time by keeping the body cool. When metabolic
heat is produced, it passes the signal to the hypothalamus which distributes
the heat to different parts of the body via blood circulation to release
body heat by evaporation of perspiration, convection, radiation, and
conduction. Thus, the hypothalamus controls the core temperature of
the body. Water vapor permeability through the membrane strongly depends
on the microstructure and hydrophilicity of PU. The physical and chemical
properties mostly depend on the soft and hard segment ratio, the molecular
weight of the monomer, and processing parameters. Incorporating the
hollow silica aerogel makes the PU membrane more water vapor- and
air-permeable, radiative, and robust. The hollow silica aerogel has
super affinity to moisture and can pass water molecules to the environment
by using its hollow water vapor passing channel.

WVT, temperature, and relative humidity.

Convection is one heat transfer mechanism of the body; convection
contributes to the transportation of body heat from the body’s
surface into the environment. During the convection process, air removes
body heat from the skin to the environment and cools down the body
during high activity. Heat stroke is a common reason of death during
extreme weather or high activity such as marathon running; convective
clothing could play a significant role in minimizing these deaths;
our composite membrane and laminated fabric have the ability to cool
down our body by air convection (Figure 5A,B) and warm the body during high activity
levels and in extreme weather. Nowadays, heat-related diseases are
increasing greatly because of global climate change, with diseases
ranging from neurological diseases and cellular damage to many more
heat-related illnesses, and may cause death. Bai et al. have reported
the devastating effects on human health from recent heat waves in
China as a consequence of extreme heat stress.42 It has also been suggested that children and the elderly
are most affected during summer because of high temperatures. Air
convection play a major role in minimizing such heat-related diseases;
our laminated fabric has the ability to circulate air in hot conditions.
AP was measured on an instrument designed to pressure air through
the laminated fabrics. The rate of air passing through the test specimen
was significant, except for the PU laminated fabric. Cotton fabric
has better AP (160 cm3/cm2/s at 150 pa pressure)
because of its porous woven structure, whereas composite membranes
[140 cm3/cm2/s at 150 pa pressure (composite
1%) and 100 cm3/cm2/s at 150 pa pressure (composite
0.5%)] also have better AP. Normally, air-permeable materials allow
water vapor to pass through and therefore WVT is closely related to
the air passing ability of the material. Water vapor permeability
also depends on the material’s chemical structure. The pore
from the woven fabric structure and porous silica aerogel facilitates
the AP of the laminated fabric. For thermophysiological comfort, AP
is a very important property of a fabric. The first step of WVT is
absorption, followed by diffusion and evaporation. Additionally, WVT
mostly depends on the water absorbance ability of the material (Figure 5D). The water absorbency
of composite samples is significantly higher than that of the cotton
fabric and PU. As seen in Figure 5C, composite materials re-enforce the laminated fabric,
and composite samples are significantly strong and elastic compared
with cotton fabric. Toughness and tensile modulus also showed a similar
result that composite samples are significantly stronger compared
with PU (Figure S3). The wicking height
rate reveals the moisture absorbency ability of the material. Normally,
composite materials have better wicking height in both warp and weft
directions because of their water-absorbing ability and hydrophilic
group in the backbone (Figure 5E,F). Cotton fabric also has a good wicking height compared
with the PU membrane. To check the adhesiveness and abrasion resistance
of the laminated fabric, we performed an abrasion resistance test
(Figure 5G) and found
that there was almost no weight loss; there is also no yarn breakage
after rubbing the laminated fabric 1000 times (50 per min) with 9
kPa load, which means that the laminated fabric has very good abrasion
resistant properties.

Radiative heat emission is an
effective way by which to release
heat from the skin to the environment. Maximum amount of body heat
is released into the environment by the emission of radiation. The
human body is mid-IR radiative in the wavelength range between 7 and
14 μm.20,43 The traditional textile is not
IR-transparent and our human skin is a super IR emitter; therefore,
the IR transmittance textile provides thermal comfort to the body.
Because textile materials are very heat-absorbent, fabric temperature
rises rapidly when exposed to thermal sources.42 Silica aerogel and composites made by using silica aerogel
can be considered as semitransparent materials capable of absorbing,
emitting, and radiating heat.44−46 Our fabricated composite membrane
successfully transmitted more than 90% of inferred radiation with
a wavelength longer than 7 μm (Figure 6B,C). The schematic of the ERCF (Figure 6A) shows that the
outer surface of the laminated fabric (cotton) reflects solar radiation
and the inner surface of the laminated fabric (composite membrane)
transmits IR from the body. The presence of the silica aerogel has
improved the IR transmittance of the laminated fabric (Figure 6B,C). Consequently, PU composites
showed better transmittance compared to pristine PU, whereas the cotton
fabric showed almost zero transmittance. To maintain the human thermoregulation
system and a constant body temperature, our developed ERCF could play
a vital role.

and composite 0.5% (range 3–18 μm); and (C) IR transmittance
percentage of cotton fabric, PU, composite 1%, and composite 0.5%
(range 7–14 μm).

4 Conclusions
The developed ERCF can transfer most of
our body heat to the environment.
Climate change is increasing the global temperature daily, and the
current challenge is to keep the global temperature below a variation
of 2 °C; to do so requires sustainable and significant global
mitigation. Hot outdoor environments can have a negative impact on
the body, such as heat stroke, dehydration, and elevated heart rate.
During high activity or in a hot environment metabolism produces heat
as a byproduct. The body is 25% efficient; therefore, we lose around
75% of energy as heat. To overcome such challenges, our ERCF can play
an important role by providing passive cooling by evaporation of perspiration,
air convection, and emission of radiation from the body directly to
the environment. The ERCF has a vital role in controlling body temperature
by transferring body heat through various means into the environment
during the summer season or when the surrounding temperature is too
high. The body heat is released by evaporation of perspiration; the
evaporative behavior of the ERCF could provide evaporative cooling
by releasing body heat during extreme weather. Air convection can
also transport a significant amount of body heat from the skin to
the environment; the ERCF has an AP behavior which can provide air
convection to the human body. Emission of radiation is the most effective
way by which to release body heat, and the maximum amount of body
heat can be transported by emission of radiation through electromagnetic
waves at room temperature or below. Radiative cooling provides an
effective way by which to surpass conventional methods of controlling
the microclimate of the human body. The ERCF we have developed provides
necessary body cooling for an individual to feel comfortable at different
temperature levels.
