A combinative effect of two or more
individual material properties,
such as lattice parameters and chemical properties, has been well-known
to generate novel nanomaterials with special crystal growth behavior
and physico-chemical performance. This paper reports unusually high
catalytic performance of AgPt nanoferns in the hydrogenation reaction
of acetone conversion to isopropanol, which is several orders higher
compared to the performance shown by pristine Pt nanocatalysts or
other metals and metal–metal oxide hybrid catalyst systems.
It has been demonstrated that the combinative effect during the bimetallisation
of Ag and Pt produced nanostructures with a highly anisotropic morphology,
i.e., hierarchical nanofern structures, which provide high-density
active sites on the catalyst surface for an efficient catalytic reaction.
The extent of the effect of structural growth on the catalytic performance
of hierarchical AgPt nanoferns is discussed.

1 Introduction
It has been well-known
that the introduction of a foreigner element,
for example, during doping or alloying, to a particular nanocrystalline
system can modify the intrinsic physico-chemical properties of the
nanocrystalline system.1,2 In many cases, the material’s
new physico-chemical properties are much superior compared to their
individual intrinsic properties.3 This
resulted from a combinative effect of individual material’s
properties that can compensate their intrinsic weakness, yielding
novel physico-chemical properties.4−6 Such a combinative effect
is not only on the physico-chemical properties of the materials but
also extends to their crystal growth behavior.7−9 This will promote
the formation of novel nanocrystals’ structures and morphologies.
Unusual electrical, optical, and catalytic properties are expected
to be obtained from this process.

The Pt nanocatalyst is well-known
for its highly reactive performance
that is applicable for a wide range of applications, particularly
oxygen reduction,10,11 hydrogen evolution reaction,12−14 hydrogenation reaction,15−18 CO oxidation,19 and organic
reactions.20 Facile coordination between
Pt surface atoms with a large range of organic moieties or ligands
is considered as the key factor for such active catalytic performance
in Pt. Unfortunately, owing to, in most cases, the coordination between
Pt atoms and reactants as well as products involving a strong binding
nature, site poisoning on the Pt nanocatalyst is unavoidable and becomes
a critical issue in the catalytic reaction. Bimetallization of Pt
with other metals may successfully eliminate such a major drawback
in its catalytic properties due to the combinative effect of the individual
physico-chemical properties of the metallic components,1−3,9,21−24 producing high-performance nanocatalyst systems. For example, bimetallization
of Pt with Au,6 Pd,25 Ru,26 Rh,27 or Ni28 has exhibited excellent
performance in accelerating the direct methanol fuel cell reaction
and some reaction of organic contaminant degradation, and in general
case, its performance is several orders higher compared to individual
Pt catalytic performance. In a different attempt, it has also been
reported that bimetallization of Pt with Fe could effectively expand
its catalytic properties in the CO oxidation reaction.29

We have carried out a study on the role
of a synthetic reagent
in the growth of metals30−32 and metal oxide33,34 nanostructures and nanostructures with a controlled-morphology35,36 and atomic composition6,37 for solar cells,38,39 light-emitting diodes,40 catalysis,41−43 non-linear optics,44−47 and sensors,48−52 which were successfully obtained. We have also discovered that the
morphology, surface structure, and atomic stoichiometry in the nanocrystals
strongly influence their electrical, optical, electronic transport
performance, and catalytic properties, exhibiting high-performance
in applications. Recently, we demonstrated the formation of the AgPt
nanostructure and evaluated its catalytic performance in methyl orange
degradation.37 A unique immiscibility of
Ag in the Pt lattice and a high-difference in their ionic radii have
promoted the formation of the highly anisotropic nanostructure of
AgPt, i.e., the nanofern-like structure, a hierarchical structure
that is composed of isosceles tetrahedral nanopyramids. Their performance
is exceptionally high compared to the conventional Pt nanoparticle
catalyst or other catalyst systems. This is as a result of modifying
both density of state and bonding energy of the d-orbital system of
Pt upon the introduction of Ag, enhancing the surface reactivity of
the bimetal system. On the basis of promising catalytic performance
of the AgPt nanofern, we here evaluate its catalytic performance in
the hydrogenation of acetone to produce isopropanol. Isopropanol has
been well-known for its function as a solvent and widely used as key
materials in direct isopropanol fuel cell purpose.53 Hydrogenation of acetone is amongst the most straightforward
approach for the production of isopropanol.54 Here, we discovered that the AgPt nanofern can effectively accelerate
the conversion of acetone into isopropanol with a kinetic rate of
the reaction and a turn over frequency (TOF) as high as 1.2 ×
10–1 and 3.8 × 102 s–1, respectively. The catalytic performance depended on the Ag content
in the nanofern structures. It was also found that the catalyst system
withstood against site poisoning so that the sample can be used in
a multiple hydrogenation reaction with a relatively low-drop in its
performance. The AgPt nanofern should be potentially used for a wide
range of applications, particularly fuel cell and environment applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of AgPt
NFn
Figure 1A,B show the typical
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of AgPt
NFn that has been successfully grown on the indium tin oxide (ITO)
substrate surface. The structure of AgPt NFn is constructed by dozens
of branches consisting of nanopyramids with stems. As Figure 1 reveals, the structure of
AgPt NFn seems to be highly reactive, as it contains a large density
of high-energy sites of spiky structures for the active surface reaction
and charge transfer. The phase crystallinity of the AgPt NFn is verified
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (see Figure 1C). As shown in Figure 1C, no phase segregation is observed but instead
the diffraction peaks are related to face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt
(JCPDS 70-2057) with some distortion. In addition, no diffraction
peaks related to fcc Ag appeared in the spectra. Electron probe microanalysis
(EPMA) elemental analysis result shown in Figure 1D,E nevertheless reveals the nature of Ag
and Pt elements distribution in the AgPt NFn. It can be understood
that the Ag ions are very well dissolved in the AgPt NFn structure
and its atomic content in the AgPt nanofern can also be easily modified
in the reaction by changing the Ag ion precursors’ concentration
in the growth reaction (Figure 1E). These results confirm the successful bimetallization process
of Ag and Pt. With special morphology of a spiky structure, the AgPt
NFn should demonstrate excellent catalytic properties.

AgPt NFn formation can
be described by the following equation 1   2   3   4   5  During a
liquid phase deposition synthesis
method, K2PtCl6, precursor for Pt, dissociates
into positive ions of 2K+ and negative ions PtCl62–. The formic acid will then reduce PtCl62– ions to produce PtCl42– ions and then to Pt atoms (Pt0), which then nucleates
forming nanocrystallites. At the same time, the AgNO3 as
the Ag precursor also followed the Pt reduction and nucleation process.
In the synthesis process, the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant
may form complexes with metal ions before undergoing the reduction
process. Complex formation between metal ions and SDS will accelerate
the metal ion reduction process and at the same time will control
the growth morphology of the nanostructures.55

The lattice mismatch between Ag and Pt (i.e., as high as 0.67%)
leads to an anisotropic crystal growth of AgPt NFn as a result of
distortion of structural growth orientation of the Pt fcc system.
However, the increase in the Ag content in the NFn does not modify
the phase crystallinity of the sample as verified by XRD analysis
(see Figure 2A). Nevertheless,
the strain in the lattice increases with the increase in the Ag content
in the NFn, as shown in Figure 2B; the main Bragg plane angle shifted. The increase in the
lattice strain may modify the electron cloud distribution in the NFn,
producing unique surface chemistry properties for active catalytic
properties and charge transfer process.

2.2 Catalytic Performance of AgPt NFn
Figure 3 shows the
typical optical absorption spectrum of acetone during the hydrogenation
process under microwave irradiation (power of 110 W) in the presence
of one slide containing an optimum AgPt NFn sample, i.e., prepared
by an Ag precursor of 0.20 mM.

(A). (B) is its corresponding reaction’s kinetic rate (curve
a). Curve b in (B) is the reaction’s kinetic rate in the absence
of the AgPt nanofern for comparison. (C) The calibration curve for
acetone concentration.

As can be seen in Figure 3 the absorbance of acetone has drastically decreased
with
the increase in the reaction time, reflecting the decrease in its
concentration during the hydrogenation reaction (see Figure 3C for the concentration calibration
curve). This fact is an indication of successful hydrogenation of
acetone presumably to isopropanol. Acetone absorbance drastically
decreased with the increase in the reaction time and nearly zero value
when the reaction time reached 20 s. To understand the product of
acetone conversion during the hydrogenation reaction, we carried out
a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The result
is shown in Figure 4. As can be seen in Figure 4C, two separate peaks were found in the spectrum at retention
times of 25.501 and 27.389 s. These two peaks correspond to the retention
times of acetone and isopropanol, respectively (see HPLC spectra for
acetone and isopropanol in Figure 4A,B). Thus, these results confirmed the successful
hydrogenation of acetone to produce isopropanol. From the figure,
it can also be understood that no peaks related to the retention time
of other compounds are observed, inferring that the AgPt NFn are highly
selective to convert acetone during the hydrogenation reaction to
isopropanol.

Figure 4 HPLC chromatograph of acetone (A), isopropanol (B), and
HPLC chromatograph
of acetone hydrogenation using the AgPt NFn catalyst (C).

By using the concentration calibration curve for
acetone shown
in Figure 3C, it is
known that at the first 10 s of the reaction the percentage of isopropanol
formation has reached the value of 47% and it increased to 95.5% when
the reaction time was extended to 20 s. The kinetic rate value for
this reaction was as high as 1.2 × 10–1 s–1. This value is much higher compared to the recently
reported results on the catalytic hydrogenation of acetone to isopropanol
(see Table 1). By considering
the catalyst mass of AgPt NFn nanoparticles on one slide of ITO, which
is approximately 34 μg, the turn over number (TON) and the turn
over frequency (TOF) of the reaction were calculated. The TON and
TOF were as high as 3.8 × 103 and 3.8 × 102 s–1, respectively, deduced from the half-way
value of the reaction’s TON.

a Microwave (110 W) was applied.

and H2 was used.

We then evaluated the effect of the Ag precursor concentration
on the catalytic performance of AgPt NFn by using four different concentrations
within the range of 0.067–0.33 mM. The typical kinetic rates
of the reaction of the samples are presented in Figure 5. As can be seen in Figure 5, the kinetic rate increased with the increase
in the Ag concentration and optimum in the sample utilizing the Ag
concentration of 0.2 mM. However, the performance dropped when the
Ag concentration was higher than 0.2 mM. The catalytic reaction is
determined by the amount of catalyst used. To eliminate the effect
of the catalyst content in the catalytic reaction and to obtain the
real role of the Ag concentration in the AgPt NFn, we normalized the
catalytic performance over the catalyst mass. The result for the kinetic
rate of the reaction of the AgPt NFn with different Ag contents is
shown in Figure 5B.
As Figure 5B reveals,
the catalyst performance exponentially increased with the Ag concentration
in the AgPt NFn and is likely to saturate at a concentration of approximately
0.28 mM, which is in good agreement with the results discussed earlier.

rate per mass of the AgPt NFn prepared at different Ag precursor concentrations
normalized over their mass.

The increase of the kinetic rate value upon the increase
of the
Ag content in the AgPt NFn could be related to the enhancement of
hydrogen adsorption onto the surface of AgPt NFn. Cyclic voltammetry
analysis as presented in Figure 6 indicated that there has been an increase in the faradaic
current at the potential window of −0.8 to −0.5 V, i.e.,
potential for hydrogen reduction and oxidation. When the Ag content
in the NFn increases, the maximum current was detected on the sample
using an Ag precursor concentration of 0.2 mM. The current decreased
when the Ag content was further augmented. The increase in the hydrogen
adsorption onto the surface of AgPt NFn probably enhances the hydrogenation
of acetone that are also attached on the AgPt NFn surface. Oxidation
and reduction of different redox species were also observed in the
analysis results. For example, the oxidative dissolution of Ag to
form Ag2O (at ca. 0.41 V), reduction of Ag2O
to metallic Ag (at ca. 0.43 V), reduction of the oxidized Pt (at ca.
−0.30 and −0.10 V), and anodic oxidation of Pt (at ca.
−0.30 and 0.0 V). It is noted that the AgPt NFn morphology
was more or less similar even though the concentration of Ag was varied
in the AgPt NFn as judged in the FESEM morphological (Figure 7) and XRD analysis (Figure 2). Therefore, the
enhancement of catalytic performance of the AgPt NFn could be solely
attributed to the role of the Ag ion in the lattice in modifying the
surface chemical state of the sample. Furthermore, an increase of
the Ag concentration in the bimetallic system likely led to an enhancement
in the surface pressure,2 in which in more
extreme cases, it might reduce the density and the coherence of the
nanocrystal structure, thereby affecting the active site of the catalyst.61 This assumption likely agrees well with the
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis results (Figure 8) for the sample
with different Ag ion concentrations where the metallic state of both
Ag and Pt (curve 1 in Figure 8B,C), the key state for the active surface reaction, increased
with the increase in the Ag ion concentrations in the samples (see Table 2). However, excessive
Ag in the reaction may drive the formation of excessive oxides, deteriorating
the catalytic performance. XPS analysis further reveals that there
has been a shift in the binding energy of both Pt and Ag elements
(positive and negative, respectively) than their bulk metal states
(Figure 8B,C). This
indicates that the Ag exhibits a greater tendency to lose electrons
than Pt (i.e., electron transfer from Ag to Pt), perturbing the electronic
systems of Pt. However, such a bimetallization process also promotes
the facile electron transfer across the Fermi level of the two materials’
interface,62,63 enhancing the surface activity
of the nanofern structure. Nevertheless, the existence of different
species other than the pure metallic state is also considered as an
additional factor for the enhancement of the catalytic performance.
It has also been widely reported that the presence of the synergic
effect of metallic states, metal cations, and metal oxide states actually
extremely enhances the catalytic performance64−66 via unique
properties of metal–metal or metal–cation direct bonding
electronic system (d electron) that accelerates charge transfer in
the catalytic process.67 In many cases,
this phenomenon improves the catalytic activity and selectivity behavior
due to the formation of active hydrogen species, such as H– and H+.68,69 The improvement in the stability
of the catalyst surface is also observed due to the presence of oxide
species on the catalyst surface. Unique to the existence of the bimetal
system, the variation of the metal ion distribution on the surface
of the AgPt may produce excess heat that may accelerate the hydrogenation
reaction process.

We also evaluated the catalytic stability of AgPt
NFn by reusing
the sample in fresh acetone hydrogenation reactions. Figure 9 shows the reaction kinetic
rate of catalytic hydrogenation of acetone over a recycle AgPt NFn
sample. As can be seen in the figure, there is no significant change
in the kinetic rate of the reaction even though the AgPt NFn has been
used three times in the fresh acetone hydrogenation reaction. For
example, the kinetic rate of the reaction was as high as 1.2 ×
10–1 for the first cycle of the reaction. It changed
to 1.1 × 10–1 and 1.0 × 10–1 when used for the second and third time, respectively. With the
reduction of efficiency as low as ±8% per repetition, it indicates
that the AgPt NFn catalyst is very stable and has a limited poisoning
process.

single slide AgPt NFn. Inset shows the percentage of isopropanol produced
over three times catalytic repetition processes under microwave radiation
exposure.

In catalytic hydrogenation of
acetone under microwave irradiation,
water molecules may split producing e–, H+, OH•, H2, O2, H, and O• species that in turn play a key role in the hydrogenation
process. The electrons that are formed from this process will adsorb
or bind to Ag or Pt sites of AgPt NFn and then drives the formation
of hydrogen via interaction with adsorbed or the adjacent H+ to the catalyst surface. It is expected that the bimetallic system
of the AgPt NFn may have superior catalytic activity over the monometal
system due to the following assumptions: (i) the existence of a ligand
and the ensemble effect. It is normal in the bimetallic system, depending
on the nature of atomic distribution in the lattice, the identical
atoms tend to assemble with each other during the growth process producing
unique chemical properties on the surface. This is called as the ensemble
effect.70,71 Interensemble interaction may further enhance
the physico-chemical properties of the surface for high-performance
catalytic process. It is also understood that the addition of the
Ag atom in the Pt lattice may modify the electron distribution of
the Pt 5d orbital, especially the atoms near the Pt atoms, generating
a ligand effect, in which in many processes it generates heat energy
accelerating the hydrogenation process. In addition, hydrogen from
the bulk reaction may easily adsorb onto the Ag site of the surface,
enabling the rapid hydrogenation process of acetone. (ii) Modification
of the surface atom distribution. The co-existence of Ag atoms along
with Pt may compensate the disadvantageous properties of each metal.
For example, Pt is well-known for its active and strong binding to
hydrogen that in many cases it causes rapid poisoning of the catalyst
surface. This brings about the surface to be quickly deactivated within
a short time of reaction. By the presence of Ag, the highly active
surface chemistry of Pt is assumed to be reduced so that the bonding
nature of the adsorbate becomes more dynamic.72−74 The catalytic
site poisoning is expected to be decreased. As the Ag also demonstrates
catalytic activities to some extent, combination with the Pt catalytic
properties may also improve the selectivity nature of the catalytic
process.75 Thus, the product of the hydrogenation
of acetone is solely isopropanol. (iii) Improvement of analyte adsorption.
It is well-known that the analyte adsorption onto the catalyst surface
is strongly site dependent. The bimetallization process modifies the
density of state of the d-orbital of Pt as a result of d-band mixing.
Because the Ag’s d-band (4d) is lower than Pt (5d), the mixing
process has improved the exothermicity of the Ag site so that the
analyte adsorption will also favor to attach onto the Ag site.76 Thus, the combination of highly active sites
of Pt and Ag will improve the analyte adsorption on the AgPt NFn surface.
Such electronic nature of the AgPt NFn surface in turn easily donates
an electron to adsorbed hydrogen and acetone, weakening them for effective
and rapid catalytic hydrogenation of acetone. (iv) The high-energy
active site possessing hierarchical structure composed of spiky isosceles
tetrahedral nanopyramid nanofern. The introduction of the Ag ion into
the Pt lattice may have caused distortion in the nanocrystal lattice
growth orientation and projected a highly anisotropic nanofern structure,
which is a hierarchical structure that is composed of a spiky isosceles
tetrahedral nanopyramid with a high-energy (001) basal plane. This
characteristic should be promising for catalytic reactions. On the
basis of these properties, the AgPt NFn generates exceptionally high
catalytic performance, which is potential for a wide range of catalytic
reactions and surface chemistry applications.

In our previous
study, we have examined the effect of precursor
concentration on the structural growth of the AgPt nanostructure.
We found that the surfactant and other precursor concentrations influence
the structural growth and the surface chemistry properties of the
nanocatalysts. Nevertheless, in this study, as the catalytic performance
is related more to the structure, where the highly anisotropic structure
that contains large-scale of high-energy site, such as sharp-tipped
spike, is the most active structure as well as the removal of the
surfactant residue on the surface of the catalyst by plasma pre-treatment
prior to catalysis application, the effect of the surfactant on the
catalytic performance in this paper was not evaluated.

Nevertheless,
while the catalytic activity of the AgPt nanofern
in the hydrogenation of acetone has been obtained, the selectivity
properties, particularly related to the concentration of Ag and Pt
in the nanofern, has not yet been evaluated. It is true that the Ag
and Pt concentrations will affect the selectivity properties of the
nanoferns. However, because of a strong effect of Ag and Pt concentrations
on the structural growth, where the change in concentrations will
change the structural symmetry, we cannot obtain the effect of Ag
and Pt concentrations on the catalytic selectivity performance. However,
the study of the effect of Ag and Pt concentrations on the catalytic
selectivity properties of the AgPt nanofern is underway and will be
reported in different paper.

3 Conclusions
The catalytic properties of a bimetallic AgPt nanofern in the hydrogenation
of acetone into isopropanol were investigated. The bimetallic nanostructures
demonstrated excellent catalytic properties showing a remarkably high
reaction kinetic rate, approximately 1.2 × 10–1 s–1 in a typical process, during the conversion
of acetone into isopropanol, which was equivalent to TON and TOF of
3.8 × 103 and 3.8 × 102 s–1, respectively. This catalytic performance is very high in terms
of heterogeneous catalytic reactions. It is also observed that the
AgPt nanofern shows an outstanding selectivity properties that only
allows the acetone to be converted into isopropanol and not into other
products. In addition, the AgPt nanofern exhibits limited site poisoning,
enabling the catalyst system to be used repeatedly in a subsequence
fresh reaction with a relatively low performance drop. The existence
of the ligand and ensemble effect, which is due to the fluctuation
in the atomic distribution of element in the bimetal, unique surface
atom distribution, and availability of wide area high-energy site
are believed to be the key factors for the excellent catalytic performance.
The catalytic properties of the AgPt nanofern can be potentially utilized
in a wide range of fields including sensors, photocathodes in dye
sensitized solar cells, and electronic applications.

4 Experimental Section
The AgPt nanofern on an indium tin
oxide (ITO) substrate was prepared
by following our earlier reported technique.37 Briefly, in the typical process, a clean ITO substrate was immersed
into an aqueous solution that contains 1 mM K2PtCl6 (Fluka), 0.2 mM silver(I) nitrate (Fluka), 10 mM formic acid
(Fluka), and 10 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (99.9%, Fluka). The
volume of the reaction was 15 mL. During the reaction, the solution
was continuously stirred approximately at 500 rpm. The reaction was
proceeded for 30 min at a temperature of 40 °C, resulting in
the formation of the AgPt nanofern. The sample was then taken out
from the solution and washed with a plenty of deionized water, followed
by being dried using a nitrogen gas flow. AgPt nanoferns (NFn) with
different Ag contents were prepared by varying the Ag precursors,
i.e., AgNO3, in the reaction, namely from 0.067 to 0.33
mM. The Pt precursor concentration as well as other reagents were
fixed.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) using
a Zeiss
Supra 55VP FESEM apparatus with a 1.0 nm resolution operating at 30
kV with a function of electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was performed
to evaluate the AgPt NFn morphology. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction
(XRD) spectroscopy utilizing a Bruker D8 XRD spectrometer with a Cu
Kα irradiation and a scanning rate of 0.025° s–1 was carried out to analyze the crystal structure of AgPt NFn. The
chemical state of the AgPt NFn was characterized using an X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) technique using a Kratos XSAM-HS XPS apparatus.
The XPS data were analyzed via curve-fitting utilizing Shirley-type
background subtraction of Gaussian–Lorentzian mixed function
(70 and 30% for the Gaussian and Lorentzian components, respectively,
as the line shaping). The spectra were referenced to C 1s of a binding
energy of 284.8 eV. During the XPS measurement, the samples were treated
with Ar plasma for 10 min to remove any contaminants or organic waste
on the catalyst’s surface. After that, the samples were stored
in special polystyrene dishes that are mainly used for a tissue culture
process, which is proved to be very effective for preventing the ingress
of contaminant, prior to XPS measurement. Nevertheless, it is normal
during the transfer of the sample for XPS measurement that the sample
is exposed to the ambient. However, this will not affect the surface
properties of the samples. Thus, the XPS result will be representative.

The catalytic properties of the AgPt NFn were examined in the acetone
hydrogenation process under microwave irradiation. During the reaction,
10.0 mL of 0.1 M aqueous acetone solution that was prepared in a glass
vial was placed in a Teflon tube for microwave irradiation in a home
appliance microwave system with a controlled microwave power. A microwave
power of 110 W was adopted during the reaction. The hydrogenation
reaction of acetone to produce isopropanol was verified by evaluating
the optical absorbance of the solution reaction using a Perkin Elmer
Lambda 900 UV–visible spectrophotometer every 10 s interval
and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Agilent 1200
Series Rapid Resolution HPLC system operated under isocratic elution
conditions using a Phenomenex RoA 300 × 7.8 mm2 column.
For the HPLC analysis, a mobile phase of 0.005 N H2SO4 solution with a flow rate of 0.6 mL min–1 and a column temperature of 60 °C was used.
