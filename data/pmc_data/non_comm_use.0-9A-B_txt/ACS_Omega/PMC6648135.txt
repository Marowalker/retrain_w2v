Large-area high-quality
graphene was synthesized on different types
of copper foils preannealed under positive pressure H2 atmosphere
between 1 and 2 standard atmospheres. The prepared graphene showed
good electrical conductivity, transmittance, and uniformity. The sheet
resistance values of the grown monolayer graphene film were all about
500 Ω/□, and the transmittance was as high as 97.24%.
The carrier mobility of the monolayer graphene film was around 2000–3000
cm2/(V s). Furthermore, the monolayer coverage could be
more than 95.00% controlled by adjusting the process parameters. The
properties of the four layer-superposed graphene film nearly reached
that of the commercialized indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses, which showed
that the prepared graphene could be well applied to the transparent
conductive electrode. The obtained graphene film has been used to
construct Si/graphene solar cells without an antireflection film,
which showed energy conversion efficiency among 4.99–5.62%.

1 Introduction
Graphene,
the one-atom-thick 2D planar structure carbon material,
has been a hot spot for long time because of its unique properties.1−4 The prerequisite for these excellent properties to be fully utilized
is to prepare high-quality graphene. It is known that graphene can
be prepared by micromechanical exfoliation5 method, chemical vapor deposition (CVD),6−9 oxidation reduction10 method, solvothermal11 method, and so on. Among these preparation methods, only CVD method
can meet the requirements of large-scale preparation of high-quality,
large-area, and uniform graphene films. So far, graphene has been
grown on a number of metals7−9,12−17 by a surface-catalyzed process. Among these metals, copper foil
has obvious advantages, such as high melting point, low absorption
rate of carbon atoms, low price, and reusability. However, it is well
known that the surface condition of copper foil has a great influence
on the growth of graphene. To grow high-quality graphene films, prior
to the preparation of graphene, many pretreatment methods have been
applied on the copper foil substrates to optimize their surface conditions,
such as pickling, electrochemical polishing, oxidation, long-time
annealing, melting-resolidifying, smoothing, and so forth.18−22 In addition, in the past 2 years, single-crystal copper foil substrates
could be prepared by adjusting the annealing process of polycrystalline
copper foil. Thus, high-quality and flat substrates could be provided
for the subsequent preparation of large-scale single-crystal graphene
films.23,24 As reported previously, Alfa Aesar copper
foil (abbreviated as α copper foil) was generally used as substrates
for the growth of high-quality graphene.9,20,25 It is also noted that low-pressure H2 gas
was usually used in the pretreatment (preannealing) of copper substrates.18 In this work, we proposed to use, instead, positive
H2 pressure in preannealing of the copper foil substrate,
under which more H2 molecules would take part in modifying
the surface condition of the foil. It was expected that thus treated
foils would be more suitable for growing high-quality graphene, regardless
of the type of the copper foil.

To verify this idea, four types
of copper foils were used as the
substrates in our investigation. They were first preannealed under
positive H2 pressure of 1–2 standard atmospheric
pressure, and then, the graphene were synthesized on them under the
condition used conventionally. The experiments demonstrated that high-quality
graphene films could be deposited on all these four types copper foils
preannealed under positive pressure H2 ambient. The prepared
graphene films have good electrical conductivity (the sheet resistance
are all about 500 Ω/□) and carrier mobility (around
2000–3000 cm/(V. s)). The coverage of the monolayer graphene
could reach more than 95.00%. Besides, to demonstrate its good uniformity
and quality, different parts of a thus prepared graphene film were
used respectively to construct Si/graphene solar cells. For all of
the constructed cells, the energy conversion efficiencies (PCE) were
within 4.99–5.62%. Our results showed that the proposed positive
H2 pressure preannealing technique is promising and suitable
for different types of copper foil substrates for high-quality graphene
preparation.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of Copper Foil Substrates
Four kinds of
commercial copper foils were used in the work, which
were as follows: T2 copper foil (25 μm thick, 99.8%,
named “A”), electrolytic copper foil (25 μm thick,
99.8%, named “B”), oxygen-free copper foil (40 μm
thick, 99.8%, named “C”), and α (Alfa Aesar) copper
foil (25 μm thick, 99.8%, named “D”). All of the
reagents used in the experiment are of analytical grade.

The
purchased copper foils (A–D) were cut into pieces of size 2
cm × 2 cm. In addition, the copper foil pieces were dipped into
acetic acid solution (the volume ratio of acetic acid to water is
1:1) for 60 min at room temperature to remove the oxide layer and
impurities on their surface. Then, they were cleaned with deionized
water repeatedly for getting rid of acetic acid. To remove the organic
compounds on the foil surface, the copper foil pieces were then sequentially
soaked in acetone and ethanol for ultrasonic cleaning for 10–20
min. At last, the cleaned copper foil pieces were kept in acetone
solution or dried out for using as the substrate of graphene synthesizing
immediately.

2.2 Synthesis of Graphene Films
A tubular
furnace with a CVD system was used in our experiment. A few pieces
of the four kinds of cleaned copper foils were put on the quartz boat,
and the boat was put onto the middle of the furnace tube. A mechanical
pump was used to vacuum the tube until the inner pressure was lower
than 10 Pa. During vacuuming, hydrogen was brought into the tube at
least three times to exhaust the air inside for ensuring a clean growth
environment. Then, the foil pretreatment and graphene deposition were
started.

Figure 1 shows schematically the growth processes. A certain amount of H2 was injected into the furnace tube. Then, both ends of the
furnace tube were sealed, insuring that no air would leak into the
tube. The amount of the injected H2 gas was controlled
to provide a positive pressure between 1 and 2 standard atmospheres
inside the tube, when the tube temperature reached the annealing temperature
(9). After the H2 infection, the substrates were heated
up to 980 °C within 60 min (with the heating rate of about 20
°C/min). Then, the copper foil substrate was preannealed at the
temperature for about 30 min. Afterward, the H2 gas flow
was introduced into the tube with the flow rate of 300 sccm. In addition
at the same time, 1.4 sccm CH4 was brought in for the growth
of the graphene film. The time for the growth of graphene was about
140 min.

Figure 1 Flow diagram for the growth of graphene.

When the growth step was over, the heating system and gas
source
were turned off and the lid of the tubular furnace was opened to cool
the tube to room temperature. The size of the prepared graphene film
could be adjusted with the size of the oven’s hearth. In addition,
the graphene film with an area of 20 × 30 cm was produced in
our work.

The wet transfer method26 was used to
transfer the prepared graphene films onto SiO2/Si and Quartz
glass sheets for measuring the sheet resistance, carrier mobility,
and transmittance. The size of the SiO2/Si and quartz glass
sheets was 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm, and the transferred graphene films
covered the entire substrate surface.

2.3 Fabrication
of the Graphene/Si Solar Cells
To demonstrate the quality
of the graphene films prepared with
our method, the graphene/Si (G/Si) solar cells were fabricated with
the prepared monolayer graphene grown on oxygen-free copper foils.
The structure of the cell is shown in Figure 2, in which the layers, from the top to bottom,
are graphene film, gold/titanium (Au/Ti), alumina (Al2O3), silicon (Si),and aluminum (Al). The cell fabrication process
was briefly as follows. A mask plate of 25 mm2 (5 mm ×
5 mm) was first put on the middle of the front surface of an n-type
doped silicon wafer (⟨100⟩, 0.5 mm, resistivity: 1–10
Ω cm) of a size of 1 cm × 1 cm. Then, the front surface
of the wafer was coated with a 100 nm alumina (Al2O3) layer by using a high vacuum multitarget magnetron sputtering
coating machine. Subsequently, gold/titanium (Au/Ti) and aluminum
(Al) electrodes were evaporated to provide Ohmic contacts on the front
and back sides, respectively. Next, the mask plate was removed, leaving
a square window, and the produced monolayer graphene film was transferred
onto the Si substrate, covering the entire window and tightly contacting
with the Si wafer. To demonstrate the uniformity of the prepared graphene
films at the same time, six Gr/Si solar cells were fabricated with
their graphene layers intercepted from the produced graphene film
of large size deposited on the large size copper foil substrate.

2.4 Characterization
The pretreated foil
substrate surface, prepared graphene films, and fabricated Si/graphene
solar cells were characterized using appropriate methods as follows.
A horizontal high power X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) (model:
TTR-III) was used to analyze the structure of the copper foil surface
after negative and positive pressure annealing.

A field-emission
scanning electron microscope (model: JEOL JSM-6700F) was used to observe
the microstructure of the synthesized graphene.

Raman spectra
of the prepared films were measured using HORIBA
Jobon Yvon micro-Raman spectrometer (model: LabRAM 800HR). The layer
number and large-scale uniformity of graphene samples could be determined
by the spectral characteristics.

Visible spectrophotometer (Shanghai
Shunyu constant company, Instrument
model 723PC) was used to measure the light transmittance of the graphene
film transferred from the copper substrate to Quartz glass sheet.

The hall Effect measurement system (ECOPIA Co., Ltd., model: HMS-5000)
was used to measure sheet resistance and carrier mobility of the prepared
graphene in the van der Pauw configuration with a 0.56 T magnetic
field.

Zolix SS150 Solar Simulator is used to test the performance
parameters
of the solar cells, such as photoelectric conversion efficiency, open
circuit voltage, short circuit current, and filling factor.

3 Results and Discussion
We examined systematically the
Graphene films deposited on the
copper foils annealed under positive pressure. Figure 3a–d shows the SEM images of the graphene
films (on the silicon substrates), which were respectively grown on
copper foils A–D under the conditions of an optimizing the
gas ratio and growth time. The images indicated that thus deposited
graphene films covered the entire surface of substrates, and films
were continuous and their uniformity was good. In this case, we could
prepare graphene films with a monolayer proportion of 95% or more. Figure 3e,f shows partial
enlarged views corresponding to images a–d. From the images,
we could see that the graphene films have less dark area (dark areas
are multilayered) and have almost uniform color. The number of the
carbon atom layer of the graphene film was characterized by Raman.

to Silica wafer). (a) A copper foil, (b) B copper foil, (c) C copper
foil, (d) D copper foil; (e–h) Partial enlarged images corresponding
to (a–d).

Figure 4a–d
displays the Raman spectra of the graphene films grown on the four
kinds of copper foils (A–D), each of which contain six spectra
corresponding to arbitrarily selected 6 areas of the same graphene
film. In each chart, six color curves represent the spectra at six
different locations in the graphene. It is known that Raman spectra
of graphene materials generally show three major peaks (D peaks: ∼1350
cm–1, G peaks: ∼1580 cm–1, and 2D peaks: ∼2700 cm–1),27 and the D peak was thought to be responsible
for the existence of the defects in the sample. Figure 4a–d shows that the spectra nearly
has no D peak, which means the prepared graphene film nearly has no
defect. The ratio of I2D/IG in the spectra measured on different areas of the sample
are nearly the same (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), reflecting that the films are uniform, consisting
of monolayer regions.

Figure 4 Raman spectra of graphene films grown on (a) “A”,
(b) “B”, (c) “C” and (d) “D”
copper foils.

Monolayer graphene films
grown on the four copper foils (A–D)
were transferred to the SiO2/Si substrates to test the
sheet resistance and carrier mobility. The statistical histogram of
the measured sheet resistances are shown in Figure 5a–d, where the data were recorded
from randomly selected 15 test points on each sample. The results
show that the sheet resistance are mainly among 500–600 Ω/□.
In addition, the Hall measurement showed that the values of the carrier
mobility of these samples were 2000–3000 cm2/(V
s). The uniformity of sheet resistance and carrier mobility over the
whole layer implies higher lattice quality of the prepared graphene
films.

of copper foils: (a) A substrate; (b) B substrate; (c) C substrate;
and (d) D substrate.

However, it was found that the growth conditions of graphene
for
the four kinds of copper foils, preannealed under positive H2 pressure (less than 2 atm), were wider than negative preannealed
substrates to produce high-quality graphene films, which would be
very conducive to the industrial production. In particular, the suitable
annealing time is around 30–120 min, which is as that used
for low-pressure annealing. The growth results are not good when the
annealing time is too short or too long. This may be explained as
follows: the recrystallization of the copper foil has not yet been
completed, if the annealing time is too short; to the opposite, if
the annealing time is too long, then the evaporation of copper foil
will be too serious, leading to production of more defects in copper.

Our results demonstrated that the positive pressure annealing of
the cooper substrates is more favorable for graphene deposition. To
understand the mechanism, the surface crystalline structures of the
four types of cooper substrates annealed under positive and negative
H2 pressure were compared. Figure 6 shows the XRD spectra of the four kinds
of copper foils, where Figure 6a–d is respectively for foils A–D, and the subscripts
1 and 2 indicate the foils were annealed respectively under the ambient
of negative H2 pressure (N-A) and positive H2 pressure (P-A). For all four kinds of foils, the spectra show three
peaks (111), (200), and (220), but their intensities differ considerably
for foils treated with N-A and P-A. Figure 6a1,a2 shows the recorded
XRD spectra of “A” copper foils after N-A and P-A, respectively.
It is found that, different from the spectra of the N-A-treated sample,
for the sample after P-A treatment, the intensities of (220) and (111)
peaks were weakened, whereas the intensity of (200) peak was enhanced
considerably. The results for “B” copper foil (Figure 6b1,b2) show that for the XRD spectra (Figure 6b2) of the foil treated through
P-A, the intensities of (111) and (200) peaks were enhanced, and the
(220) peak disappeared in comparison with that of N-A-treated foil
B. The results for the “C” copper foil (Figure 6c1,c2) display that after P-A, the (111) and (200) peaks nearly disappeared,
and the (220) peak was enhanced a lot. In addition, the results for
“D” copper foil (Figure 6d1,d2) show that after P-A, the
(220) peak disappeared, and the (200) peak was enhanced with respect
to the N-A-treated foil. The results mentioned above demonstrated
that the P-A-treated copper foil, compared with the N-A-treated foil,
exhibited better crystallinity and the preferential orientation, which
would be more favorable for the growth of graphene (large area and
single crystalline).

Figure 6 XRD spectra of the four kinds of copper foils pretreated
with N-A
and P-A: (a–d) denote the foil types A–D, respectively,
and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the corresponding foils that underwent
negative and positive H2 pressure annealing, respectively.

Figure 7 shows the
optical photographs of the graphene-copper foil (copper foil annealed
under negative pressure). In Figure 7a–c, the places that are not covered with graphene
were oxidized and showed the color of copper oxide. In Figure 7d, the copper foil is α
copper foil, which could prepare large area and continuous films under
negative pressure and certain parameters as has been reported in many
papers. Figure 8 shows
the optical photographs of the graphene/copper foil (copper foil annealed
under positive pressure). As could be seen from the pictures, graphene
grown on four kinds of copper foils have very good continuity, and
graphene film completely covered the surface of the copper foil substrate.
By comparison, graphene films with better quality could be prepared
on copper foil substrates under positive pressure annealing.

Figure 9a displays
the picture of a 20 cm × 30 cm oxygen-free copper foil (type
C) with a graphene layer deposited on its surface. Figure 9b is the optical microscope
photograph of the graphene layer (shown in the picture (a)) transferred
to a silicon substrate. From the picture, it is seen that the whole
grown graphene is continuous and exhibits the same color, implying
that almost no multilayer region exists in the grown film. Figure 9c is the Raman spectra
recorded from randomly selected 16 sites of the as-grown graphene
film on the oxygen-free copper foil. These spectra clearly demonstrate
that the grown graphene is basically in monolayer form and the amount
of defects is very small. The transmittance of the deposited monolayer
graphene film is 97.24% (λ = 550 nm) as shown in Figure 9d. With the method of wet transfer26 and layer superposition, a four layer-superposed
graphene film was prepared, of which the sheet resistance was about
80 Ω/sq and the light transmittance was 90.70%. Through the
same method, 1–4 layers graphene film were transferred to silicon
oxide substrates, as shown in Figure 9e, and the surface resistance was tested. The results
are shown in Figure 9f. It could be seen that the surface resistance of 1–4 layers
of graphene was reduced from 500 to 80 Ω/sq. These properties
of graphene films nearly reached that of the commercialized indium
tin oxide (ITO) glasses. The surface resistance of the commercialized
ITO glass is in the range of several tens of ohms to several hundred
ohms, and the light transmittance is 80% or more. The higher the light
transmittance, the larger the sheet resistance is. These results show
that the graphene we prepared could be well applied to the transparent
conductive electrode.

It was possible to synthesize single-crystal graphene domains
by
controlling the growth condition. We prepared single-crystal graphene
by adjusting the growth condition parameters. As shown in the Figure S1, the diameter of the prepared single-crystal
graphene was about 500 μm.

Figure 10 shows
the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of the Gr/Si solar cells. As seen from the figure,
the curves for the six solar cells are similar to each other and with
only a small dispersion. From the figure, the performances of the
cells were derived, and the results are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that all of
the cells have similar performances. These results evidenced qualities
of different parts of the graphene film that were nearly the same,
which indicated that the graphene film prepared in this work was quite
uniform.

4 Conclusions
The positive pressure H2 ambience annealing method was
proposed and used to pretreat the cooper foil substrates for graphene
deposition. The results demonstrated that high-quality, large-area
graphene films could be deposited on different types of cooper foil
substrates by using the proposed substrate preannealing method. The
sheet resistances of the obtained graphene films are all about 500
Ω/□. In addition, the coverage of the monolayer graphene
film on the substrates could be more than 95.00%. The transmittance
of the produced monolayer graphene film is as high as 97.24%. The
electron mobility of the graphene films grown on the four types of
copper foils was in the range of 2000–3000 cm2/(V
s). The prepared graphene films were used to fabricate graphene/silicon
solar cells. The energy conversion efficiencies of all of the fabricated
cells were between 4.99 and 5.62%, which also illustrated the continuity
and uniformity of the prepared graphene films. The advantage of the
proposed method was preliminarily analyzed, which could be attributed
to the better crystallization orientation of the copper foils under
positive pressure H2 ambience annealing.
