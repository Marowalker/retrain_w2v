Voltage-dependent anion-selective
channels (VDACs) are primarily located in the mitochondrial outer
membrane (MOM). They are essential for the regulation of ion and metabolite
exchanges. In particular, their role in energy-related nucleotide
exchange has many implications in apoptosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative
diseases. It has been proposed that VDACs’ functions are regulated
by mobility of the N-terminal helical domain, which is bound to the
inner wall of the main β-barrel domain but exists in equilibrium
between the bound-folded and the unbound-unfolded state. When the
N-terminal domain detaches from the channel’s wall and eventually
leaves the lumen, it can either stay exposed to the cytosolic environment
or interact with the outer leaflet of the MOM; then, it may also interact
with other protein partners. In humans, three different VDAC isoforms
are expressed at different tissue-specific levels with evidence of
distinct roles. Although the N-terminal domains share high sequence
similarity, important differences do exist, with the functionality
of the entire protein mostly attributed to them. In this work, the
three-dimensional structure and membrane affinity of the three isolated
hVDAC N-terminal peptides have been compared through Fourier-transform
infrared and NMR spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics
simulations, and measurement of the surface pressure of lipid monolayers.
Although peptides were studied as isolated from the β-barrel
domain, the observed differences are relevant for those whole protein’s
functions in which a protein–protein interaction is mediated
by the N-terminal domain.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) is a 30 kDa
pore-forming protein located in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM).
VDACs are mainly responsible for ion and metabolite exchange between
the cytosol and the intermembrane space of mitochondria, being particularly
important for the regulation of adenosine nucleotide exchange, such
as ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD+.1−5 In addition to the pore activity, VDACs interact with many cytosolic
proteins, such as hexokinases6 and Bcl-2
family members,7 playing a crucial role
in the regulation of apoptosis8,9 with many implications
in cancer10,11 and in neurodegenerative diseases.12,13 On the intermembrane space side, VDAC interacts with both creatine
kinase and adenine nucleotide translocator, playing a fundamental
role in the generation of membrane potentials in mitochondria.14−16

Higher eukaryotes express
three different isoforms of VDAC, encoded by three distinct genes.4,5 VDAC1 is the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed of the three
isoforms, with VDAC2 and VDAC3 10 and 100 times less expressed, respectively.4,5,17 The electrophysiological features
of the three VDAC isoforms were studied in detail in artificial membranes.
Mammalian VDAC1 and VDAC2 are easily incorporated into phospholipid
bilayers and are sensitive to the applied voltage. On the other hand,
VDAC3 hardly forms pores in artificial membranes and shows a reduced
sensitivity to voltage.18,19 In particular, at low
voltages, VDAC1 and VDAC2 show high conductance and selectivity for
anions over cations, whereas they switch to the so-called “closed
state” at higher voltages, which is characterized by low conductance
and cation selectivity.

The three-dimensional (3D) structures
of both human and mouse VDAC1 were solved by X-ray crystallography,
solution-state NMR, and a hybrid approach.20−23 A few years
later, the zebrafish VDAC2 X-ray structure was also released.24 More recently, two new crystal structures of
VDAC1 have been released.23 Overall, the
results indicate a common structure for the three VDAC proteins. VDAC
is a large transmembrane channel formed by 19 amphipathic antiparallel
β-strands, with the only exception of the parallel pairing between
strands 1 and 19. The outer diameter of this β-barrel is 4.5
nm, whereas the inner diameter is about 3.0 nm, but it is reduced
down to 2.0 nm by the invagination of the N-terminal domain into the
channel’s lumen.20−22,24,25 All
of the reported 3D structures show VDAC in the open state, representing
the basis to characterize its permeability and selectivity at the
atomic level through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.26−28 However, simulations were not
able to show the closed state.29,30 The N-terminal domain
of VDAC is proposed to modulate the two states but, unless specific
conditions are applied, the “closed” states are transiently
and rather infrequently visited, with their structural nature still
unclear.30

In both mouse and human
VDAC1 structures, the N-terminal domain consists of 25 amino acid
residues. The central portion is folded as a relatively short helix
(ca. 15 residues).21−23 A
similar structure was found in zfVDAC2, in spite of the additional
11 N-terminal residues.24 In the five structures,
the N-terminal helix is located half-way along the channel, such that
it restricts the lumen and provides steric filtering to metabolite
passage. In addition, its net positive charge characterizes the electrostatics
of the whole channel, both in terms of permeability and selectivity.31 However, the exact position inside the lumen
and the folding of the N-terminal domain were questioned. On the one
hand, the X-ray structures showed that the helix is attached to the
channel’s wall,21,22,24 and,
on the other hand, the NMR structure of human VDAC1 at room temperature
revealed a mostly unfolded N-terminal domain unbound from the channel’s
wall and partially blocking the lumen.20 This is particularly important since the stability of its folding
and adhesion to the internal wall of the channel were proposed to
be fundamental for barrel stability and, in turn, channel permeability
and gating.26,27,29,32−36 In addition, the N-terminal domain was also shown to be primarily
responsible for VDAC interactions with apoptosis-related proteins,4,9,10,37 for
which it is assumed to detach from the β-barrel wall and move
out of the channel. A straightforward experiment showed that unbinding
of the N-terminal domain from the channel wall was promoted by destabilizing
its helical structure and that, in turn, its exposure to the cytosol
outside the lumen was favored.38

The three human VDAC isoforms share high sequence similarity, with
the N-terminal domain having slight but significant differences. All
of the three N-terminal fragments show an amphipathic helical profile,35 but whereas hVDAC1 has no cysteine residues,
two of them are present in the sequence of both hVDAC2 and hVDAC3.
Furthermore, VDAC2 has 11 additional residues on the N-term side.
In light of these differences, as well as of the different expression
level, the hypothesis of complementary roles was put forward.5,10,17 This is well supported by the
work of Reina and colleagues,39 which showed
that the swapping of the N-terminal domain of VDAC3 with the corresponding
sequence of VDAC1 completely changed the channel activity, indicating
that the N-terminal domain is critical for channel functionality.

Two main factors contribute to stabilize the folded state of the
N-terminal fragment when it is bound to the channel wall: its amphipathicity31 and several specific hydrophobic contacts and
hydrogen bonds.20−22,31,36 Most of the
models proposed in the literature have the N-terminal fragment unbinding
from the internal wall as the very first step. Then, the N-terminal
domain can move out of the channel and either stay unfolded and solvent-exposed
or possibly bind to the external leaflet of the MOM.9,10,29,32 In
this scenario, the amphipathic profile, which is strictly interconnected
to both folded structure and binding stability, is of primary importance.
However, when widely used hydropathicity scales were applied,31,35 no significant differences were found among the N-terminal fragments
of the three hVDAC isoforms because of their high sequence homology
(Figure 1). Nevertheless,
a different folding tendency has recently been reported, even in isotropic
buffered solutions, with helical propensity following the order hVDAC2(12–36)a > hVDAC3(1–25) > hVDAC1(1–25).35 Therefore, it is fundamental to characterize
possible differences at a higher level of details to shed some light
on the different functionalities of the three isoforms.

Figure 1 Sequence alignment of the three N-terminal hVDAC peptides.
Differences are highlighted in bold.

In this
work, the same three peptides have been fully characterized in terms
of the 3D structure adopted upon binding to a membrane-mimicking model
using both experimental and computational techniques. Structure differences
were also correlated with the evidenced difference in membrane affinity.
The observed differences appeared to be due to subtle variation in
the amino acid sequence of the three peptides. By studying the isolated
peptides, we focused on the unspecific interaction they have with
the lipid bilayer by virtue of the intrinsic possibility to form an
amphipathic 3D folded structure. Direct information about the relative
stability of the channel-bound state could not be obtained (in the
absence of the β-barrel domain). However, after the N-terminal
domain detaches from the pore’s lumen, its availability to
interact with the various proteins related to VDAC functions will
ultimately depend on its membrane affinity, such that the reported
differences between the three hVDAC N-terminal peptides potentially
underlie the different functionalities of the whole proteins.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Peptide Conformation on Lipid
Vesicles
Attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR was employed
for the conformational analysis of the three hVDAC N-terminal peptides
in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). The composition
of the latter was 20%mol 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) (negatively charged) and 80%mol 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) (zwitterionic), which was selected to mimic the overall content
of negative lipids in the MOM.40Figure 2 shows the amide
I band region of the three peptides together with the model α-helical
peptide model amphipathic peptide (MAP), whose secondary structure
was previously characterized through oriented circular dichroism.41

Figure 2 (A) Stacking plot of
the normalized amide I band from
samples of hVDAC1(1–25) in red, hVDAC2(12–36) in green,
hVDAC3(1–25) in blue, and MAP in black. Spectra were acquired
in the presence of LUVs with 20%mol POPG and 80%mol POPC, at a lipid/peptide molar ratio of 10 and a total peptide concentration
of 2 mM. The table reports the position of the maximum and a dashed
line centered to that of MAP is shown as a reference. (B) The same
spectral region for the four samples in A are superimposed.

The three hVDAC peptides showed a comparable
profile for the amide I band, with the most intense component at ∼1650
cm–1, which is indicative of α-helical folding.42−44 The shoulder at ∼1580
cm–1, which was almost absent in the spectrum of
MAP, mostly originated from the stretching modes of tyrosine and aspartate
side chains.42,43 Although, at the first sight,
the three hVDAC peptides appeared similar, they showed significant
differences. In particular, the position of the maximum of hVDAC2(12–36)
was identical to that of the model peptide MAP, indicating a regular
α-helical folding. Differently, the position of the maximum
observed for the other peptides was lower (Figure 2A) and comparable to each other, suggesting
a less regular backbone conformation.42,43 Then, all three
hVDAC peptides showed a band broader than the model peptide MAP (Figure 2B), indicating superior
conformational flexibility and, possibly, plasticity.42,43 This was not surprising since the MAP peptide was specifically designed
to fold as a highly amphipathic α-helix in the presence of lipid
layers. Interestingly, hVDAC2(12–36) showed the smallest full-width
at half-maximum (FWHM) among the three hVDAC peptides, with a value
of 48 cm–1, whereas the amide I bands of hVDAC3(1–25)
and hVDAC1(1–25) were slightly larger, with FWHM of 50 and
53 cm–1, respectively. For the sake of comparison,
MAP showed a FWHM of 31 cm–1.

However, the
intrinsic low resolution of infrared spectroscopy did not allow us
to obtain more details about structural differences among the three
hVDAC peptides. Although the difference in the amide I band’s
position was indicative, the FWHM was quite large, and we did not
want to attempt a quantitative deconvolution. We preferred to move
to higher resolution techniques, instead, as reported below.

2.2 Three-Dimensional Structure
Liquid-state NMR was coupled to computational techniques to solve
the 3D structure of the three hVDAC peptides in the presence of DPC
micelles. A series of two-dimensional (2D) experiments, namely DQF-COSY,
TOCSY, NOESY, and 1H13C HSQC were used to assign 1H and 13C resonances45,46 for hVDAC1(1–25),
hVDAC2(12–36), and hVDAC3(1–25) (Tables S1–S3). The software TALOS+47 was applied to analyze the experimental chemical shift
of peptides’ backbone to estimate values for the Φ and
Ψ angles. Figure 3 shows the results together with the corresponding uncertainties
(see Section 4 for
definition of “good”, “warn”, and “dynamic”).

Figure 3 Backbone
Φ and
Ψ angles predicted through the software TALOS + on the basis
of the experimental chemical shift values of both 1H and 13C for (A) hVDAC1(1–25), (B) hVDAC2(12–36),
and (C) hVDAC3(1–25). Prediction ranked as good and “warning”
(see Section 4) are
reported in green and orange, respectively. The few dynamic predictions
are not shown for the sake of clarity. Selected amino acid residues
are explicitly labeled in the picture to help the discussion provided
in the text.

In each peptide, the last five residues were classified as dynamic,
and for this reason they were excluded from Figure 3. This was an expected result, due to the
presence of three glycine residues located in the C-terminal portion
of each peptide. Concerning the other residues, most of them resulted
in a good ranking. Predictions of the few residues marked as warn
were excluded from both structure calculations and MD simulations.

In the case of hVDAC1(1–25), residues from P5 to K20 populated
the α-helix region of the Ramachandran plot with the only exception
of residue A8 (Figure 3A). Residue T6 resulted in a warn attribution due to a single outlier
(see Section 4) but,
regardless, it has to be noted that up to four consecutive residues
with proper Φ/Ψ values are needed to define at least one
round of a α-helix. Thus, by taking the reported results into
account, hVDAC1(1–25) was predicted to fold as α-helix
only from residue D9 to K20 on the basis of the experimental chemical
shifts.

Also for hVDAC2(12–36), the α-helix region
of the Ramachandran plot was populated by residues from P5 to K20
with the only exception of residue G11 in this case. Up to four residues
in this range were designated as warn, namely, P5, S6, 7Y, and N19,
i.e., at the beginning and end of the range. Thus, peptide hVDAC2(12–36)
was predicted to fold as a longer α-helix, seemingly starting
from the fifth residue, with a kink at the level of G11.

Finally,
in the case of hVDAC3(1–25), only N3 was ranked as warn. A
lower number of residues populated the α-helix region of the
Ramachandran plot. These corresponded to the positions from L10 to
K20 without exceptions. Thus, the prediction for this peptide’s
fold was not dissimilar from hVDAC1(1–25).

Only good-ranked
Φ/Ψ estimated values were included as restraints in both
structure calculations and MD simulations, together with NOE-derived
interproton distances. Only unambiguous assignments were taken into
account. Figure 4 shows
the typical representation of sequential interproton distances.

Figure 4 Sequential
interproton through-space dipolar coupling (NOEs) for (A) hVDAC1(1–25),
(B) hVDAC2(12–36), and (C) hVDAC3(1–25). Short (i,i + 1) and medium-range (i,i + 2; i,i +
3; i,i + 4) NOEs are shown as lines
connecting the two residues involved. Three different line thicknesses
are used to indicate the relative intensity of the corresponding NOESY
cross-peaks, which were categorized as weak, medium, and strong.

The results found for hVDAC1(1–25) and hVDAC3(1–25)
were similar to each other, characterized by short- and medium-range
NOEs spreading all along the peptide sequence but with the highest
density approximately from the 10th to the 20th position. The number
of medium-range i,i + 3 and i,i + 4 interactions was higher for hVDAC3(1–25)
than that for hVDAC1(1–25), although the NOE intensity was
lower on average. Peptide hVDAC2(12–36) showed the lowest number
of sequential NOEs among the three peptides under investigation. However,
these were concentrated in the region between the 6th and the 20th
position of the sequence, and they were of medium intensity for the
most part.

Three-dimensional structure calculation was performed
without any water or detergent molecule, at first, through a simulated
annealing (SA) scheme. Thousand-peptide conformers were independently
generated from the same starting random configuration. The 100 conformers
with the lowest potential energy were selected and their secondary
structure analyzed (Figure 5A). To perform a structure refinement, the conformer with
the minimum average root mean square deviation (RMSD) from among the
others was selected as the starting configuration for MD simulations
with explicit solvent and detergent micelles. The last 50 ns of the
trajectory were analyzed in terms of the secondary structure (Figure 5B).

Figure 5 Secondary
structure analysis
from computer simulations with NMR-derived geometrical restraints.
Results are shown for (A) the 100 conformers with the lowest potential
energy from SA, and (B) the last 50 ns of MD trajectories. Selected
positions along the sequences are marked with dashed lines and corresponding
Arabic number. Whenever occurrence was lower than 100% for a given
portion, this is explicitly indicated.

Despite
the high sequence similarity, significant folding differences emerged.
The hVDAC1(1–25) showed the shortest and less regular folded
fraction. A helical structure comprising residues from 9 to 19 resulted
from the SA. However, a first 310-helix round was present
only in 50% of the conformers. After a long MD equilibration in the
presence of explicit solvent and the detergent micelle, a unique α-helix
was found for the same portion, with an additional round of 310-helix between the 5th and the 7th position only in 50% of
the conformers.

The α-helical folding was more regular
and stable for hVDAC3(1–25). A unique α-helix comprising
residues from 10 to 21 resulted from SA, then MD revealed an additional
helical round up to the 24th position in 80% of the frames. Peptide
hVDAC2(12–36) was definitely the one with the highest occurrence
of α-helical conformation for most of the amino acid residues.
A rather long α-helix was observed already from the SA, with
a kink at the level of G11. The N-terminal portion of the helix started
from P5 but had an occurrence of 50%. This was almost completely stabilized
during the MD.

However, it is important to note that the overall
helicity of hVDAC2(12–36) and hVDAC3(1–25) was remarkably
comparable, with the most important difference being the localization
of the folded portion along the amino acid sequence. In particular,
the N-terminal half was almost completely unfolded in hVDAC3(1–25),
whereas this showed some folding ability at the C-terminal end. In
addition, a slight but significant difference was also found in the
probability distribution of the helix length (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Helix length distribution
from MD simulations for the
three hVDAC N-terminal peptides.

Although, again, these results demonstrate
the marked difference of hVDAC1(1–25), some interesting differences
also emerged between the other two isoforms. To finally compare helix
flexibility, we selected the portion always folded as α-helix
in all three hVDAC peptides already in the SA conformers. This was
the region comprising residues from 11 to 19, for which we calculated
the backbone RMSD using the frame corresponding to 50 ns of our MD
production runs as the reference structure. Results were in the order
hVDAC1(1–25) > hVDAC3(1–25) > hVDAC2(12–36),
i.e., 0.3(2) ± 0.1(1), 0.26 ± 0.09, and 0.13 ± 0.06
Å, respectively. Even if the standard deviation showed overlapping
results, it was really interesting to find a perfect correlation with
the order found based on the FWHM of the amide I band in infrared
spectra (Section 2.1). Finally, Figure 7 shows the 3D structure obtained for the three N-terminal hVDAC peptides.

Figure 7 Three-dimensional structure
of (A) hVDAC1(1–25),
(B) hVDAC2(12–36), and (C) hVDAC3(1–25) are shown. The
final frame from the MD simulation is reported on the left hand, where
only the backbone trace is shown for clarity. On the right hand, the
superposition of the last 50 ns of the MD is shown (10k frames in
step of 100) with both backbone and side chains represented. Structures
were rotated to have the N-terminus on the left.

2.3 Affinity to Lipid Monolayers
Surface pressure (π) measurements are able to provide information
about peptide tendency to insert through lipid molecules in a monolayer,
indicating thus, their ability to perturb the lipid package. By measuring
the difference of surface pressure (Δπ) of a given lipid
monolayer at different initial values (πi) after
injection of the peptide in the aqueous subphase, important information
can be derived. A straight line for Δπ vs πi is typically obtained, from which the maximum surface pressure
variation (Δπmax) and the exclusion pressure
(πex) can be extrapolated as the intercept with the y- and x-axis, respectively. The composition
of the lipid monolayer was identical to that of the liposomes used
for FTIR measurements (Section 2.1), i.e., 20%mol POPG (negatively charged)
and 80%mol POPC (zwitterionic), to mimic the overall content
of negative lipids in the MOM.40Figure 8 shows the results
obtained for the three hVDAC peptides.

Figure 8 Surface pressure difference
(Δπ)
as a function of initial surface pressures (πi) for
hVDAC1(1–25) in red, hVDAC2(12–36) in green, and hVDAC3(1–25)
in blue is shown. The corresponding linear curve fitting obtained
by least-squares minimization is reported. In the table, the values
of both Δπmax and πex are
given. Monolayers were prepared with 20%mol POPG and 80%mol POPC. Peptide concentration in the subphase was 1.5 μM.

It is immediately evident
that hVDAC2(12–36) had a remarkably different affinity for
the monolayer, when compared to either hVDAC1(1–25) or hVDAC3(1–25).
In particular, πex, i.e., the monolayer surface pressure
at which the peptide is no more able to penetrate, was 124% of that
extrapolated for the other two hVDAC peptides. This result reflects
the inherent stronger ability of hVDAC2(12–36) to intercalate
between the lipids. On the other hand, hVDAC1(1–25) and hVDAC3(1–25)
showed an almost identical behavior, with lower Δπ values
in comparison to hVDAC2(12–36) at any πi.

When these results are taken together with the folding structure
and conformational flexibility, the positive correlation between membrane
affinity, folding ability, and structure rigidity emerges clearly.
Despite the high sequence identity shared by the three hVDAC N-terminal
peptides, isoform 2 has a distinct behavior. When bioinformatic tools
were applied to analyze peptide sequence’s amphipathicity,
no significant differences were found among the three peptides.31,35 Results previously obtained in buffered solutions without any membrane
model or artificial folding support35 were
absolutely in agreement with the evidence reported here, bolstering
the distinct properties of the N-terminal domain of isoform 2, even
without the first additional 11 residues.a The
fundamental reasons for this remain to be deciphered, but it appeared
that the subtle combination of a few single-point mutations (Figure 1) made the difference
in the behavior of the hVDAC2 peptide. The available scoring functions
for hydropathic profiling were unable to predict the reported differences.
Further studies are needed to shed light on this point.

3 Concluding Remarks
Whether
the three human isoforms of VDAC have distinct and complementary roles
is still unclear.5,17,39 Most
of the available 3D structures of VDAC show that the N-terminal domains
are folded in a helical conformation and bound to the β-barrel’s
internal wall, half-way through the hydrophobic portion of the membrane.21−24 As
such, the N-terminal domain plays a major role in the channel functionality
as a pore by (i) forming a restricted zone that acts as the main steric
filter for molecules, and (ii) by determining the electrostatic potential
inside the channel and, thus, its ion selectivity.26,27,31,48 The N-terminal
domain is stabilized in the folded-bound state by two main factors:
first, the helix amphipathicity31 and,
second, several specific hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds.20−22,31 Detachment
of this domain from the channel wall is widely recognized to be the
very first step of the channel’s gating mechanism, but this
is also related to other important functions of VDACs, i.e., interaction
with anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins like hexokinase and Bcl-2 family
members.10,37 In addition, evidence was provided about
N-terminal domain’s role in the oligomerization of VDAC1, which,
upon apoptotic stimuli, is believed to be responsible for the formation
of a larger conduit, allowing cytochrome c release
to the cytosol.49

After unbinding
the channel’s wall, unfolding and movement of the N-terminal
domain will be promoted. Leaving the lumen will turn into the eventual
exposure to the cytosol, from where the N-terminal domain might bind
to the external leaflet of the MOM9,10,26,29,31,32,50 by
assuming again its specific amphipathic conformation. The relative
probability of staying mostly unstructured and solvent-exposed, or
adhering and folding onto the MOM, ultimately depends on the affinity
for the latter. Thus, the affinity of the N-terminal peptide for the
MOM can have a profound impact on those whole VDAC’s roles
in which a protein–protein interaction is mediated by this
domain.

In this work, remarkable differences were shown for
the shared portion of the N-terminal domain of the three human VDAC
isoforms. In particular, the interaction with surfaces that favored
amphipathic conformations revealed their dissimilarities. The hVDAC1(1–25)
peptide was the one with the lowest helical propensity and folding
stability. The other two peptides, hVDAC3(1–25) and hVDAC2(12–36),
shared a higher helicity, but the structured portion was remarkably
different. The latter was definitely the one with the highest membrane
affinity. Although simplified membrane models were used in our experiments,
the results clearly highlighted interesting differences between the
three N-terminal hVDAC domains. The present investigation was performed
on isolated peptides but, nevertheless, important information can
be inferred. Of course, the absence of the β-barrel domain in
our experiments prevented the possibility of assessing possible specific
differences as far as the channel’s wall-bound state is concerned,
while we focused on the different behavior after detachment.

The expression level of the three hVDAC isoforms was different and
appeared also to be tissue-specific, with evidence that bolstered
possible different roles.5,17 The most expressed (and
studied) VDAC1 is reported to be probably the isoform mainly responsible
for both ion and metabolite permeation through the MOM. This “classic”
channel function is related to its gating, which requires an N-terminal
domain in equilibrium between the bound-folded and unbound-unfolded
state,29 in agreement with the highest
conformational plasticity found for hVDAC1(1–25) in this report.
In addition, the relatively low affinity for the membrane model we
used suggests a high probability for the N-terminal domain to stay
mostly unstructured and solvent-exposed when leaving the lumen. In
this configuration, this domain can be expected to interact with the
cytosolic protein hexokinase more easily than if it was bound onto
the MOM’s external leaflet. Comparative studies with the other
isoforms are very few but the information collected so far indicates
that VDAC2 might have a predominant role in apoptosis as the Bak receptor,
as well as in the modulation of the interactions among antagonist
proteins of the Bcl-2 family. These pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins
are located in the MOM. Interestingly, the higher membrane affinity
we found for hVDAC2(12–36) in this work supports the putative
primary role of the corresponding isoform. Finally, VDAC3 appeared
to have an intermediate behavior within the present work, with the
N-terminal peptide being more rigid than VDAC1 but sharing the same
low affinity for the membrane model. This is the least expressed and
least characterized isoform and further investigations are needed
to understand the differences from the other two isoforms.

[MCIPPSYADLGKAARDIFNKGFGFG], and hVDAC3(1–25) [MCNTPTYCDLGKAAKDVFNKGYGFG],
were purchased from Peptide Protein Research Ltd. (Fareham, U.K.)
as HCl salt, with amidated C-terminus and a purity of 98%. Peptide
model amphipathic peptide (MAP) [KLALKLALKALKAALKLA], HCl salt, 95%
purity with amidated C-terminus was kindly provided by Prof. Anne
S. Ulrich and Dr. Parvesh Wadhwani from the Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology, Germany. Glycerophospholipids, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), were purchased from
Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) with a purity grade of >99%.
The reducing agent 1,4-dithio-d-threitol (DTT) was used at
a 1:3 peptide/DTT molar ratio in all experiments with both hVDAC2(12–36)
and hVDAC3(1–25) to prevent oxidation of cysteine residues
and the formation of either intra- or intermolecular disulfide bridges.
Perdeuterated dodecylphosphocholine (DPC-d38) and 3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′,3,3′-tetradeutero-propionic
acid (TSP-d4) were purchased from Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories with a purity of 98%. All other chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless differently indicated.
A complete list follows (with used name/abbreviation): chloroform,
≥99.8% (CHCl3); methanol, ≥99.8% (CH3OH); perdeuterated water, 99% D (D2O); phosphate
buffer saline (PBS) was prepared at 10 mM total phosphate concentration
(KH2PO4 + K2HPO4) and
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4.

4.2 Vesicle Preparation
Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were
used as the membrane model in the infrared spectroscopy experiments.
LUVs were prepared by the extrusion method with the mini-extruder
from Avanti Polar Lipids. Appropriate amounts of POPC and POPG were
weighed in a dark glass vial and dissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH 1/1 v/v. The organic solvent was removed under a gentle
stream of nitrogen and the obtained lipid film was placed under vacuum
pumping overnight. PBS was used to rehydrate the film, and after five
vortex cycles of 1 min separated by 1 min rest, a suspension of large
multilamellar vesicles was obtained. Then, five freeze–thaw
cycles were performed by placing the vial in liquid N2 and
in a 323 K water bath. Finally, extrusion was carried out by passing
the vesicle suspension (1 mL) 11 times through a polycarbonate filter
(Whatman). In particular, the first extrusion was performed with a
400 nm pore size filter, then with a second 100 nm filter. To mimic
the net charge of MOM,40 a composition
of 20%mol negatively charged POPG and 80%mol zwitterionic POPC was chosen.

4.3 Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflection mode (ATR-FTIR) was
chosen to investigate the peptide conformation and plasticity. Spectra
were acquired at room temperature with a Bruker Vector-22 equipped
with a diamond single-reflection platinum ATR module and a liquid
nitrogen-cooled MCT detector. The software OPUS (Bruker, V6.5) was
used both for spectra acquisition and data analysis. All three peptides
were investigated in PBS solution prepared with D2O as
solvent, at a final concentration of 2 mM in the presence of LUVs
at a lipid/peptide molar ratio of 10. For each peptide, 10 μL
of solution were placed on the ATR crystal and dried with a gentle
stream of nitrogen, to reduce the disturbance by the intense solvent
absorption bands and to attain a significant improvement of the signal/noise
ratio (S/N). The height of the peptide amide I band (∼1650
cm–1) was about 10 times that due to the D2O stretching mode (∼2500 cm–1). After the
spectrum was acquired on the dried film, several droplets of D2O were dispensed all around the sample area and then covered
with a Petri dish. Adsorption of D2O vapor and rehydration
of the sample were monitored for about 60 s. Spectrum acquisition
was started when the height of the D2O stretching band
was 3 times that of the peptide amide I band. All spectra were recorded
with a spectral window of 3500–600 cm–1,
resolution of 4 cm–1, automatic atmosphere compensation,
and 32 scans. Before each measurement, the clean ATR crystal was acquired
as background and automatically subtracted by the software.

4.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Peptides were dissolved in 700 μL of a dispersion of DPC-d38 micelles in PBS at a final concentration
of 2 mM and at a peptide/detergent molar ratio of 1:50. The methyl
resonance of TSP-d4 (∼2 mM) was
used as the internal reference for both 1H and 13C chemical shift scales. NMR spectra were acquired at 300 K with
a Unity Inova 500 NM high-resolution spectrometer (Agilent Technologies,
CA), operated at a 1H frequency of 500 MHz and equipped
with an indirect detection probe. 1H spectra were acquired
using a 6.7 μs pulse (90°), 1 s delay time, 1 s acquisition
time, and a spectral width of 6 kHz. The WET sequence51,52 (100 Hz-wide uburp shape centered at water resonance) was applied
to suppress the water signal. Two-dimensional (2D) experiments, 1H–1H double-quantum filtered correlation
(DQF-COSY), 1H–1H total correlation (TOCSY),
and 1H–1H nuclear overhauser effect (NOESY)
spectra were recorded over the same spectral window, by each of the
512 increments with 2048 complex points and 48 scans. Mixing time
was 80 and 200 ms for the TOCSY and NOESY, respectively. The 1H–13C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation
(HSQC) spectra were recorded using a spectral window of 6 kHz for 1H and 21 kHz for 13C.

4.5 NMR-Based Structure Calculation
The
peptide 3D structure was obtained through the simulated annealing
(SA) protocol implemented in the software Dynamo.53 In addition to Dynamo force-field potentials, experimental
restraints were applied to interproton distances and backbone torsion
angles as explained herein. NOESY cross-peaks (NOEs) were classified
as strong, medium, and weak on the basis of their relative intensity,
and upper limits of 0.27, 0.33, and 0.50 nm were applied, respectively,
to restrain the corresponding interproton distance. The potential
energy contribution was zero below the upper limit, whereas a harmonic
potential was applied above. Only unambiguously assigned NOEs were
considered. Either Φ or Ψ backbone angle restraint was
obtained from the statistical analysis performed on the 1Hα, 1Hβ, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shift values implemented in the software TALOS+.47 Briefly, TALOS + analyzes the input peptide
sequence in terms of successive [i – 1, i, i + 1] residue triplets. Both experimental
chemical shift values, as well as the residue types, are compared
to the 10 best-matched triplets in a high-resolution structure database
and to the prediction output of the implemented artificial neural
network.47 Final prediction ranking is
stringent. The estimated Φ/Ψ couple is ranked as consistent
or good only if the central residues of all of the 10 best-matched
triplets cluster in the same region of the Ramachandran plot, otherwise
it is designated as ambiguous or warn. Residues with a calculated
random coil index-derived order parameter54,55S2 < 0.5 are ranked as dynamic anyway. Only
the predictions ranked as good were used as torsional angle restraints.
One thousand structures were calculated with 5k steps at 4000 K and
20k steps of cooling down to zero. The 100 conformers with the lowest
potential energy were selected for the analysis. Neither solvent nor
detergent molecules were included in the calculations.

4.6 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed through the
GROMACS package version 4.6.3,56,57 in the presence of one
DPC micelle and explicit solvent. The GROMOS-53A6 force-field58 was used for the peptide and the SPC model59 for water. Force-field parameters and the relaxed
configuration of a DPC micelle with 54 molecules60 were downloaded from http://moose.bio.ucalgary.ca/. The starting peptide configuration was obtained through the NMR-based
SA reported above (Section 4.5). The 100 conformers with the lowest potential energy were
aligned on the basis of their backbone; the one with the minimum average
root mean square deviation (RMSD) from among the others was selected
and placed in a random orientation at 2 nm from the micelle surface.
Water and the minimum number of counterions needed to neutralize the
total charge filled the 8 × 8 × 8 nm3 cubic simulation
box. Thousand steps of energy minimization were performed using the
steepest descent algorithm. Positional restraints were then applied
on the heavy atoms for 100 ps. Finally, experimentally derived NMR
restraints (interproton distances and backbone torsion angles; see Section 4.5) were introduced
in the system topology. As Hα and Hβ are not explicitly
represented in the united-atom force-field of choice, corresponding
interproton restraints were elongated by 0.1 nm. An equilibration
run of 10 ns was performed, followed by 100 ns trajectory production.
The time step was 2 fs, and system coordinates were recorded every
5 ps. All simulations were carried out in the NPT ensemble at 300
K and 1 bar. The velocity-rescale algorithm61 was used for temperature coupling with τT = 1.0
ps. The Berendsen62 and Parrinello–Rahman63,64 algorithms were used for pressure coupling with τP = 1.0 ps during the equilibration and production run, respectively.
A twin-range cut-off (1.0 and 1.4 nm) was applied to describe Lennard-Jones
nonbonded interactions. The particle mesh Ewald summation was used
for the electrostatics with a cut-off of 1.0 nm.

4.7 Lipid Monolayer Preparation
Appropriate amounts of POPC and POPG were weighed and dissolved
in CHCl3/CH3OH 1/1 v/v to obtain a homogeneous
mixture with 20%mol POPG and 80%mol POPC. This
specific composition was the same as that used for vesicle preparation
(Section 4.2), and
it was chosen to mimic the net charge of MOM.40 The total lipid concentration of the stock solution was about 2
× 10–5 M. In a circular well of 19 mm diameter,
a 500 μL drop of PBS was deposited and aliquots of the lipid
stock solution were spread at the air/buffer interface using a Hamilton
microsyringe. A lipid monolayer was easily formed as organic solvents
spontaneously evaporated, due to self-association of lipid molecules
at the air/buffer interface.

4.8 Surface Pressure Measurements
The surface pressure
of the lipid monolayer was measured at 300 ± 1 K with a tensiometer
Kibron “DeltaPi”, which exploits the Wilhelmy method,
described in detail elsewhere.65 The instrument
makes use of a high-resolution electrobalance (resolution of 0.01
mN m–1) attached to a platinum wire with 0.5 mm
diameter. All measurements were performed at constant area. Filtered
deionized water was used during the calibration stage by measuring
the voltage difference (probe at the interface and at air) corresponding
to a surface tension of 500 μL (71.7 mN m–1) in a circular glass well (diameter of 19 mm). Under the same experimental
conditions, the surface pressure of 500 μL of PBS was measured
and set as the reference zero. By spreading different amounts of the
lipid stock solution (in small aliquots) as described herein before
(Section 4.7), monolayers
with a different initial surface pressure (πi) were
prepared in the 5–25 mN m–1 range. After
the lipid monolayer reached a stable πi, a small
volume of the peptide stock solution (50 μM in PBS) was injected
into the subphase at a peptide final concentration of 1.5 μM.
The surface pressure was monitored over time up to a stable final
surface pressure (πf). The surface pressure variation
induced by the peptide intercalating the lipids was obtained as Δπ
= πf – πi.
