In this study, glycerol
phosphate was introduced into polyurethane
(PU) to promote the coating stability of hydroxyapatite (HA) during
its mineralization on the PU surface. Glycerol phosphate was successfully
conjugated with the PU chain during polymerization. Phosphate groups
in glycerol phosphate accelerated the nucleation of HA under calcium
phosphate ion-rich conditions (concentrated simulated body fluid),
resulting in the enhancement of structural stability. The robust interface
between HA and PU also improved mechanical properties. Hydrophilic
phosphate groups and bioactive HA improved in vitro cellular responses
in terms of the attachment and proliferation of L929 fibroblasts and
MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts. Thus, the highly elastic and bioactive PU-gp-HA
could be a promising candidate for tissue engineering applications
that experience frequent deformation, including diverse cartilage
replacements.

1 Introduction
Elastomers
have been widely adopted in long-term tissue engineering
fields, such as breast implants, tissue expanders, and cartilage replacements,
because most of these materials resist degradation in body fluids,
maintaining their inherent viscoelastic mechanical properties.1−3 One of the representative elastomers for biomedical applications
is polyurethane (PU), which exhibits rubber-like elasticity and has
an inherent porous structure.4,5 In addition, the molecular
stability of PU is essential to permanent implants for nonregenerative
tissues, including breast prosthesis surrounded by soft tissues, and
the cartilage or bone of elderly individuals.6−8 However, the
only limitation of PU for use in permanent implants is its low biocompatibility,
reflecting its hydrophobic polymer chain.9 To enhance the biological property of PU, several
bioactive coatings were deposited using hydrogels or bioceramics.10,11

HA is one of the most qualified biocompatible calcium phosphate
minerals, and it has a high affinity to biopolymers and thermodynamic
stability in body fluids.12,13 Thus, there have been
numerous efforts to improve the biological property of polymers using
various HA-incorporating methods, including the solvent-compression
method, simple powder mixing, and mineralization.14−16 Among these
techniques, mineralization is favorable to improve the coating stability
and biological properties because HA nucleation is induced at specific
functional groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl, and phosphate groups) with
strong binding forces.17,18 However, as PU has no specific
sites for interactions with hydrophilic coating layers, coating stability
had not been achieved without any further processes. Thus, Yuk et
al. attempted to generate a robust interface between elastomers and
hydrogels through the application of chemical crosslinking processes.19 Kim et al. provided nucleation sites on substrates
for accelerating apatite growth.20 Chemically
bonded amorphous calcium phosphates grew into hydroxyapatite (HA),
forming a stable and homogeneous coating layer.

In this study,
glycerol phosphate was introduced as a new conjugate
to improve HA coating stability on PU to provide nucleation sites
for calcium phosphate ions and accelerate HA mineralization. Glycerol
phosphate is a derivative of glycerol, which is a chain extender of
PU.21 Thus, glycerol phosphate, which has
a structure similar to that of glycerol, can be easily conjugated
with PU through addition without any complex conditions. In addition,
the exposed phosphate groups on the polymer chain act as a link between
mineralized HA and PU, inducing stable coating systems.

This
study addresses an efficient method to fabricate a structurally
stable and biologically improved PU-HA composite incorporating glycerol
phosphate. The surface morphology, chemical bonding, and crystalline
phase were analyzed, and the mechanical and biological properties
were also investigated. Moreover, its potential uses, including cartilage
or bone replacements, were introduced.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication of PU-gp-HA
PU-gp-HA
was synthesized through two steps, PU modification and HA mineralization,
as schematically represented (Figure 1a). First, glycerol phosphate was conjugated with the
PU chain during polymerization. Isocyanates in PU prepolymer reacted
with hydroxyl groups of water (H—OH), forming a urea linkage,
which is the main bonding of the polymer chain. Phosphate functional
groups were also exposed on the surface of the polymer chains as a
result of another reaction between the isocyanates and hydroxyl groups
(R—OH) of glycerol phosphate. Through the competitive reaction
between two hydroxyl groups, PU-gp was successfully fabricated and
characterized using 31P NMR (Figure 1b). The peak was shifted from the zero point
of standard phosphoric acid to 6.68 ppm, indicating the presence of
the phosphate monoester (R-O-PO(OH)2) of glycerol phosphates,
whereas no peaks were detected in pure PU, as this compound has no
P source or linkage.22

and (2) PU-gp-HA formation; (b) solid-state 31P NMR results
according to the existence of glycerol phosphate
with chemical structure of designed PU-gp-HA and (c) scanning electron
microscope (SEM) images of surfaces of PU-gp-HA at different precipitation
times (0, 4, and 12 h) (scale bar = 10 μm).

Second, PU-gp-HA was fabricated through treatment in concentrated
simulated body fluid (SBF) solutions for 4 and 12 h. During precipitation,
amorphous CaP nanoparticles reversibly formed in the solution. The
phosphate groups in PU-gp provided nucleation sites for reversibly
existing CaP nanoparticles and calcium and phosphorus ions. The nanoparticles
were anchored onto nucleation sites and grown into microspheres with
a diameter of 1 μm, which were homogeneously distributed during
the 4 h treatment. After 12 h, spherical CaP particles were fully
deposited on the substrate, forming flat HA crystal films (Figure 1c).

X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis was performed according to the
precipitation time (4 and 12 h) and the amounts of glycerol phosphate
(0, 2.5, and 10 wt % to polymer) (Figure 2). As pure PU has no nucleation sites that
gathered CaP nanoparticles, no specific peaks were detected after
the 4 h precipitation (see Supporting Information). After 12 h, HA peaks were observed on pure PU, resulting from
physically stacked HA sediments. However, as the amounts of glycerol
phosphate increased, PU-gp accelerated CaP nucleation and HA crystal
growth, which is thermodynamically more stable at a given pH and ion
concentration than CaP.23 Broad HA peaks
were observed only for the 4 h treated PU-gp, reflecting the fast
nucleation and crystallization process. After 12 h, highly crystalline
HA was clearly obtained, showing a high and narrow peak.

PU-gp-HA (4 and 12 h treated specimens). The asterisk
indicates the characteristic peaks of HA. Additionally, the surface
morphology change depending on the precipitation time and the amounts
of glycerol phosphate was briefly depicted in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Mechanically Reinforcing Effects of HA
The mechanical properties of PU, PU-gp, and PU-gp-HA were investigated
to understand the effect of conjugated glycerol phosphates and HA
on the mechanical properties of PU. A representative stress–strain
curve was obtained from the tensile test (Figure 3). Failure occurred in the elastic deformation
region for all groups. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS), elongation
at break, and stiffness are summarized in Table 1 to determine the glycerol phosphate effects
on the mechanical properties of PU. Pure PU showed a highly elastic
performance, deforming 100.82 ± 8.98%. However, as the concentration
of glycerol phosphate increased, the overall mechanical properties
decreased. A 2.5 wt % of glycerol phosphate did not deteriorate the
innate property of pure PU, whereas a 10 wt % of glycerol phosphate
negatively influenced the mechanical properties of PU. UTS decreased
to 0.41 ± 0.04 MPa, and the elongation at break simultaneously
decreased to 68.62 ± 1.66% in PU-10 wt % gp. The competitive
reaction of water and glycerol phosphates primarily contributed to
the attenuated mechanical properties. A very large amount of glycerol
phosphate hindered chain propagation compared with pure PU, leading
to a short polymer chain, and the final product lost its elastic property
similar to PU-10 wt % gp, although 2.5 wt % conjugation did not unfavorably
affect PU. However, incorporating the HA layer enhanced the strength
of PU-gp. The stiffness of PU-2.5 wt % gp significantly increased
from 0.69 ± 0.04 MPa (PU-2.5 wt % gp) to 0.80 ± 0.02 MPa
(PU-2.5 wt % gp-HA), an even higher value than that of pure PU (0.69
± 0.05 MPa), demonstrating that the sturdy HA layer partially
dissipates the deformation energy. It has been suggested that the
robust interface between elastomers and bioceramics induced higher
stiffness and strength. Thus, these materials were not just physically
stacked, but they electrically interacted with the phosphate groups
of PU-gp. In addition, even in PU-10 wt % gp, the HA layer
compensated for the weakened strength and stiffness leading to values
comparable to those of pure PU. In summary, 2.5 wt % of glycerol phosphate
was optimum for improving mechanical properties without any undesirable
effects.

2.3 HA Coating Stability
The coating
technique is one of the most widely used methods to integrate two
or more compounds for improvement of the biological properties of
substrates.24 However, fabricating a durable
and long-lasting coating layer is essential and also difficult, particularly
in biomedical applications, reflecting frequent deformation under
physiological conditions.25 Thus, additional
treatments, such as conjugating another biocompatible agent with the
original polymer framework, have been adopted for high affinity with
other biolayers.26 In effect, glycerol
phosphate successfully enhanced the coating stability, even in harsh
environments. To demonstrate the coating stability, the durability
was assessed when exterior forces
were applied to PU-gp-HA and PU-HA. The initial amounts of HA were
significantly different according to the existence of glycerol phosphate
(8.22 ± 2.28% of HA in PU-HA and 14.73 ± 1.94% of HA in
PU-gp-HA) (Figure 4a). After the sonication test, little HA debris was detected on the
PU-HA surface, where 80% of HA was detached because the turbulence
of sonication was sufficient to delaminate physically deposited HA
from PU (Figure 4b).
However, most HA (12.13 ± 0.02% of HA) remained in PU-gp-HA,
as the sonication energy was insufficient to disrupt the robust interface
between PU-gp and HA. Thus, the coating stability and durability of
this compound are advantageous for bioimplants, which should bear
frequent movements or impacts, such as meniscal replacements.27

2.4 In Vitro
Biological Properties of PU, PU-gp,
and PU-gp-HA
To demonstrate the potential uses in tissue
engineering applications, the in vitro biological properties of PU,
PU-gp, and PU-gp-HA were evaluated using L929 fibroblasts (Figure 5a–c) and MC3T3-E1
preosteoblasts (Figure 5d–f). On pure PU, the cells were not spread and showed a spherical
shape, reflecting the bioinert nature of PU (Figure 5a,d). However, the cells stretched their
filopodia, forming focal adhesions with the phosphate groups in PU-gp
(Figure 5b,e) and bioactive
HA of PU-gp-HA (Figure 5c,f). The degree of proliferation, obtained using an MTS assay, is
also indicated in Figure 5g,h. On day 3, cell viability was not significantly different
in all samples because the stage of proliferation was too early to
show a clear difference in the number of viable cells. The cell proliferation
levels on Pu-gp at day 5 showed relatively low effectiveness of PU-gp
in promoting cell proliferation. However, the cells on PU-gp-HA were
significantly higher than those on PU-gp at day 5, suggesting that
glycerol phosphate provided a hydrophilic and biocompatible surface
for cells to attach with elongated or stellate shapes. HA not only
provided suitable surfaces for cell adhesion but also enhanced cell
viability remarkably. Thus, PU-gp-HA is promising for use in diverse
tissue engineering applications, including both soft tissue and hard
tissue from in vitro cell tests.

3 Conclusions
The
results of this study demonstrated that elastomer-modifying
techniques using glycerol phosphate can induce homogeneous HA precipitation,
enhance adhesion stability between PU and HA, and improve the inherent
biological properties of PU. During precipitation,
CaP nanoparticles spontaneously gathered to form phosphate functional
groups, acting as nucleation sites for HA. Rapid HA formation and
the robust interface reinforced the mechanical properties of PU. The
coating stability was also improved through interactions between covalently
bonded functional groups and HA. Furthermore, outstanding in vitro
biocompatibility indicated a great potential for use in tissue engineering
applications, including auricular cartilage replacement and bone regeneration
scaffolds.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Preparation
of PU-gp
Glycerol phosphate
solutions were prepared after dissolving glycerol phosphate disodium
salt hydrate (C3H7Na2O6P·xH2O, Sigma Aldrich) in distilled
water with a weight ratio of 1:80 and 1:20, respectively. The prepolymer
of PU (HYPOL 2002; Dow Chemical Co., Ltd., U.K.) and glycerol phosphate
solutions were mixed at a weight ratio of 1:2 at room temperature
to adjust final compositions (weight ratio of PU/gp = 1:0.025 and
1:0.1). In addition, pure PU was also fabricated as a comparison group
through a reaction between distilled water and the prepolymer without
glycerol phosphate.

4.2 HA Mineralization on PU-gp
For accelerating
HA mineralization, highly concentrated ionic solutions were prepared
after sequentially dissolving sodium chloride (NaCl, Sigma Aldrich),
potassium chloride (KCl, Sigma Aldrich), calcium chloride (CaCl2, Sigma Aldrich), magnesium chloride (MgCl2, Sigma
Aldrich), and sodium phosphate monobasic (NaH2PO4, Sigma Aldrich) in water to reach the concentration of 10-fold SBF,23 PU-gp was immersed in solution for 4 and 12
h after adding sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, Sigma Aldrich)
to increase the pH to 6.5 at 37 °C.

4.3 Characterization
of PU, PU-gp, and PU-gp-HA
The chemical structure of PU-gp
was investigated using a 500 MHz
solid NMR spectrometer (Bruker Advance II) equipped with 4 mm MAS
BB-1H. The specimens were prepared as fine particles with dimensions
of 60–70 mesh and dried in a vacuum chamber. 31P
nuclear detecting channel was acquired at 202.46 MHz using exponential
multiplication (EM) window functions. After confirmation of PU-gp
synthesis, to verify the effects of glycerol phosphate on HA nucleation,
the surface morphology and crystalline structure of PU-gp-HA with
different amounts of glycerol phosphate were detected using a field-emission
SEM (SUPRA 55 VP; Carl Zeiss, Germany) and XRD with Cu sources (XRD,
D8-advance; Bruker Co., Germany) at a scanning rate of 2°/min
from 20 to 60°, respectively.

4.4 Mechanical
Properties of PU, PU-gp, and PU-gp-HA
The mechanical properties
of PU, PU-gp (weight ratio of PU/gp was
2.5 and 10 wt % each), and PU-gp-HA (precipitation time was 12 h)
were measured using Instron in the tensile mode (Model 5565; Instron
Corp., Danvers, MA). The specimens were prepared in rectangular shape
with a dimension of 4 mm × 5 mm × 50 mm. The experiments
were performed with a constant strain rate of 1 mm/min. The UTS, elongation
at break, and stiffness of each group were determined from the stress–strain
curves.

4.5 Stability Test of PU-gp-HA
To demonstrate
the effect of glycerol phosphate on the stability of HA, PU-HA (control)
and PU-gp-HA were immersed in water and sonication was performed for
30 min. Specimens with and without sonication were combusted under
N2 conditions up to 600 °C with a heating rate of
5 °C/min. The ratio of the remaining HA in PU-HA and PU-gp-HA
was calculated using the following equation  where WHA,r is
the weight ratio of HA in PU-HA and PU-gp-HA, WHA is the weight of HA after combustion, Wcomp is the initial weight of PU-gp and PU-gp-HA. Moreover,
the surface morphology of PU-HA and PU-gp-HA after sonication was
observed using SEM to determine the degree of HA detachments.

4.6 Biological Properties of PU, PU-gp, and PU-gp-HA
The
biological properties of PU, PU-gp, and PU-gp-HA were analyzed
using a preosteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1, ATCC, CRL-2593) and a fibroblast
cell line (L929, derivative of strain L, Mus musculus, mouse). Before the cell tests, the specimens were washed with sterilized
distilled water for 3 days in a clean bench. Preosteoblasts and fibroblasts
were seeded onto each sample at densities of 2 × 104 and 5 × 104 cells/mL, respectively, for the attachment
test. The cells were cultured in an α-minimum essential medium
(Welgene, Korea) containing fetal bovine serum (5% for preosteoblasts
and 10% for fibroblasts) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and
incubated for 1 day in air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
After a day of culturing, the cells were fixed using 2.5% glutaraldehyde
after rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently,
the cells were sequentially dehydrated using 75, 95, and 100% ethanol.
Finally, the cells were treated with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane
for 10 min and dried in a fume hood. The post-treated specimens were
observed using SEM. Cell viability was also verified by MTS assay
(CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution; Promega) using preosteoblasts
and fibroblasts. After 3 and 5 days of culturing, post-treatment was
conducted after the following steps. The specimens were washed with
PBS, transferred to new 24-well tissue culture plates, immersed in
α-minimum essential medium with tetrazolium compound dye and
incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The quantity of formazan product
as a result of mitochondrial activity in live cells was measured as
the absorbance at 492 nm using a microreader (Model 550; Bio-Rad).

4.7 Statistical Analysis
All experimental
data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), using
three specimens for each group (n = 3). The statistical
analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically
significant (*p < 0.05, **p <
0.01).
