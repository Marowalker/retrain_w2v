Clathrate hydrates
have received massive attention because of their
potential application as energy storage materials. Host water frameworks
of clathrate hydrates provide empty cavities that can capture not
only small molecular guests but also radical species induced by γ-irradiation.
In this work, we investigated structure II methyl vinyl ketone (MVK)
binary clathrate hydrates with CH4, O2, and
N2 and the effects of secondary guest species on MVK conformation
in the cavity of hydrate and on the thermodynamic stability of unirradiated
and γ-irradiated hydrate phases. The present findings provide
meaningful information to understand the nature of guest–host
interactions in γ-irradiated clathrate hydrates and to open
up practical applications for hydrate-based nanoreactors.

1 Introduction
Clathrate hydrates are
nonstoichiometric crystalline compounds
that are stabilized by host–guest molecular interactions. Numerous
guest molecules that vary in type and size have been reported to be
enclathrated in the host frameworks of water cages.1 Because of their capability to accommodate gas molecules,
clathrate hydrates have been considered to be the media for gas storage
and separation. Hydrate pelletizing for natural gas transportation
and hydrate-based carbon dioxide separation from precombustion gases
are examples of utilizing clathrate hydrates as gas storage media.2,3 For these utilizations, the thermodynamic stability of clathrate
hydrates is one of the most important factors. In particular, the
pressure and temperature conditions for stable storage of gases are
the key issues to evaluate the potential of gas storage materials.

There are three widely known structures of clathrate hydrates,
structure I (sI, cubic Pm3̅n), structure II (sII, cubic Fd3̅m), and structure H (sH, hexagonal P6/mmm), usually depending on the molecular sizes and geometries of guest
molecules.1 Small gaseous molecules below
4.2 Å such as O2, N2, or H2 form
sII clathrate hydrates solely under considerably high-pressure conditions,
and slightly larger molecules such as CH4 or CO2 form sI clathrate hydrates solely under low-pressure conditions.
Adding organic molecules such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tert-butylamine to a water solvent can dramatically reduce
the formation pressures of binary sII clathrate hydrates of organic
guests and small gases, even though partial occupation of cages by
the organic guests leads to a decrease in the storage capacity.4−6

In a recent study, it has been reported that γ-irradiation
to sII methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) + CH4 hydrate induces
an intracavity conformational change in MVK guest molecules and increases
the dissociation temperature of the hydrate phase. Although the exact
mechanism for delaying the dissociation has not been revealed, enhancement
of the thermodynamic stability of clathrate hydrates by γ-irradiation
might provide important information for the application of hydrates
to storage materials.7 Some studies on
irradiation of clathrate hydrates have been reported. Bednarek et
al. published two studies on the appearance and disappearance of trapped
electrons in X-irradiated tetramethylammonium hydroxide (Me4NOH) clathrate hydrates,8,9 and Lee and co-workers
reported the existence of superoxide ions and ionic host–guest
interactions in a γ-irradiated Me4NOH + O2 clathrate hydrate.10−12

Some studies have focused on atomic hydrogen
generation in irradiated
clathrate hydrates. Yeon et al. reported that γ-irradiation
of THF + H2 hydrate creates hydrogen atomic radicals from
the enclathrated hydrogen molecules.13 Shin
et al. demonstrated that hydrogen atomic radicals can be generated
from a water framework when the ionic clathrate hydrate containing
N2 guest molecule is γ-irradiated.14 Koh et al. suggested two additional hydrogen radical generation
pathways from the anions of the host lattice and ionic guest molecules
in a γ-irradiated semiclathrate hydrate system.15

Studies on the γ-irradiation of canonical clathrate
hydrates
such as methane, ethane, ethylene, or tert-butylamine
hydrates were performed by Ohgaki and co-workers.16−19 They also reported a hydrogen
picking phenomenon between guest molecules in adjacent cages in γ-irradiated
propane hydrate, methane + propane mixed hydrate, and isobutane hydrate.20−22 The hydrogen picking is a kind of chain reaction: induced n-propyl or isobutyl radical attacks α-hydrogen of
propane or isobutane molecule in neighboring cages, and other radical
species are produced. When β-hydrogen is attacked, isopropyl
or tert-butyl radicals are produced, and then, the
chain reaction is terminated because they have thermally stable stereostructures.
As the temperature increases, the population of thermally favored
radical species (isopropyl radical in the propane hydrate and tert-butyl radical in the isobutane hydrate) increases.
The structural changes in propyl or butyl radicals induced by the
intermolecular hydrogen-picking phenomenon resemble the intracavity
conformational change in MVK molecules occurring in the γ-irradiated
MVK + CH4 clathrate hydrate; however, there has been no
additional investigation on the thermodynamic stability of γ-irradiated
clathrate hydrates showing intercavity proton transfer after the irradiation.

In this study, we investigated the thermodynamic stabilities of
binary MVK clathrate hydrates before and after γ-irradiation.
The crystal structures of binary MVK + O2 and MVK + N2 hydrates were identified using a synchrotron high-resolution
powder diffraction (HRPD) pattern analysis. The liquid water (LW)–hydrate (H)–vapor (V) phase equilibrium curves
of three binary MVK clathrate hydrates with CH4, O2, and N2 were obtained. To measure the dissociation
temperature at which the secondary gaseous guests are released, Raman
spectra of the binary MVK hydrates before and after γ-irradiation
were also obtained at various temperatures. The secondary guest dependence
of the intracavity conformational change phenomenon occurring in the
γ-irradiated MVK clathrate hydrates was also investigated using
Raman spectroscopy.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure Identifications of MVK + Gaseous
Guest Hydrates
In our previous study, the crystal structure
of MVK + CH4 clathrate hydrate was identified as cubic Fd3̅m (lattice parameter a = 17.1959(3) Å at 80 K), usually called sII hydrate,
through a HRPD pattern analysis.7 Although
the calculated molecular size of s-cis MVK (8.36
Å) is slightly larger than a suitable size (below 7.5 Å)
to fit into sII large cavity, which is suggested in the literature,1 the incorporation of the MVK molecule is allowed
by the flexibility of the hydrogen bonded water framework. The lattice
parameter of MVK + CH4 hydrate in this work is significantly
larger than the values a = 17.138 Å (at 77 K)
for CH4 + C3H8 hydrate (molecular
size of C3H8: 6.28 Å)23 and a = 17.107 Å (at 90 K) for CH4 + C2H6 hydrate (molecular size of C2H6: 5.5 Å)24 but
slightly smaller than the value a = 17.240 Å
(at 77 K) for CH4 + tetrahydropyran hydrate (molecular
size of tetrahydropyran: 6.95 Å).23 Smaller lattice parameter of MVK hydrate than that expected from
its molecular size could be due to the hydrogen bonding ability of
the MVK molecule, which allows shorter distances between host H2O and MVK guests.

To additionally identify the structures
of binary MVK + O2 and N2 hydrates, HRPD patterns
of both hydrates were obtained and analyzed. As shown in Figure 1, most reflections
in both patterns for MVK + O2 and MVK + N2 hydrates
are well-matched to a cubic Fd3̅m structure (green ticks of both patterns), and a small fraction of
hexagonal ice (P63/mmc; blue ticks) exists. The lattice parameters are a = 17.1931(5) Å for MVK + O2 and a = 17.2312(0) Å for MVK + N2 hydrates. Therefore,
it is concluded that the MVK molecule is a sII hydrate former with
small gaseous molecules as help guests.

2.2 Phase
Equilibria of MVK + Gaseous Guest Hydrates
After the crystal
structures of the binary MVK clathrate hydrates
were identified, the phase equilibria of MVK + CH4, O2, and N2 clathrate hydrates were measured at the
temperature ranges of 280–292, 273–281, and 271–279
K and in the pressure ranges of 5–21, 7–20, and 7–20
MPa, respectively, with various MVK concentrations (3.0, 5.6, and
8.0 mol %). The phase boundary curves are presented in Figure 2 for MVK + CH4 hydrates,
in Figure 3 for MVK
+ O2 hydrates, and in Figure 4 for MVK + N2 hydrates, and each
figure contains the phase boundary curve for pure CH4,
O2, or N2 hydrates from the literature for comparison.25−27 The detailed experimental data are shown in Tables 1–3.

For the
MVK + CH4 clathrate hydrates, their phase equilibrium
curves are shifted to relatively less stable regions (i.e., lower
temperatures at any pressure and higher pressures at any temperature)
than that of the pure CH4 hydrates.26 More concentrated systems have relatively unstable pressure–temperature
phase equilibrium conditions. The MVK seems to act as a thermodynamic
inhibitor in the MVK + CH4 clathrate hydrate system. On
the other hand, for the binary MVK + O2 or MVK + N2 hydrate systems, their phase equilibrium curves are shifted
to more stable regions than those of the pure O2 or N2 hydrates (Figures 3 and 4).25−27 The stoichiometric concentration
for large cages (51264 cages) of sII clathrate
hydrate, 5.6 mol % MVK, represents the most stable phase boundary
condition for both the O2 and N2 cases. At this
stage, we should consider that the crystal structures of pure O2 and N2 hydrates are cubic Fd3̅m (i.e., sII hydrates), whereas those of pure CH4 hydrate are cubic Pm3̅n (i.e.,
sI hydrate).1 All three binary MVK clathrate
hydrates of CH4, O2, or N2 are sII
hydrates, as described above. Therefore, it is concluded that the
MVK, a sII hydrate former, acts as a thermodynamic promoter of sII
hydrates. For the methane case, the hydrogen bonding ability of an
MVK molecule can make MVK act as a thermodynamic inhibitor similar
to many antifreezes. Outside of the clathrate hydrate phase, MVK destabilizes pure sI methane
hydrate, and thus, the phase equilibrium curve of MVK + CH4 hydrate might exist at a more stable region than that of sI methane
hydrate, which is being inhibited by MVK in solution.

2.3 Large Guest Conformation in MVK + Gaseous
Guest Hydrates
In nature, there are two conformers of s-cis and s-trans MVKs (molecular sizes:
8.36 Å for s-cis and 7.53 Å for s-trans forms),7 and their existence ratio depends on the temperature.26−28 In our previous report, it was confirmed that the s-cis form of
MVK is the preferred molecular geometry in the 51264 cage of MVK + CH4 sII hydrate in spite of its
larger size and that an intracavity conformational change from the
s-cis to s-trans form of MVK can be induced by γ-irradiation
using an annealing process.7 The relative
energy difference between the two conformers is 0.6 kJ/mol obtained
by DFT calculation using the B3LYP model and 6-311++G(d,p) basis set,
and the torsional energy barrier from s-cis to s-trans is 6.56 kJ/mol.29 Lee et al. suggested that only one favorable
conformation for the enclathrated guest exists when the energy difference
between the two conformers is approximately 10 kJ/mol;30 therefore, the relative energy difference and
the torsional energy barrier can be overcome by the thermal annealing
process in the presence of electron transferring.

To check the
conformation of enclathrated MVK molecules in unirradiated and γ-irradiated
MVK + O2 or N2 clathrate hydrates, we obtained
the Raman spectra of those samples at various temperatures (Figures 5 and 6). As we used a 5.0 mol % solution of MVK, which is slightly
less concentrated than the stoichiometric concentration for sII hydrate
(5.6 mol %), it was assumed that most MVK molecules were included
in the clathrate phases for all samples. Enclathration of O2 or N2 in sII hydrates can be confirmed from the symmetric
stretching modes observed at frequencies of 1546 cm–1 (for O2) and 2322 cm–1 (for N2) (Figures 5a and 6a). Although a portion of 51264 cavities could be occupied by the O2 or N2 guest in the MVK concentrations of this work, the vibration frequency
of O2 or N2 in the 51264 cavity is not distinguishable from that in the 512 cavity
in Raman spectroscopy.31−34 For the MVK enclathration, two peaks at 1626 cm–1 (for C=C stretching mode) and 1692 cm–1 (for C=O stretching mode), which implies the s-cis form in
the 51264 cavity,7 were observed at 93–153 K (Figures 5a and 6a). As in the
case of acetone, the hydrogen bonding between C=O functional
group of the enclathrated MVK molecule and host water framework might
exist,35−37 but it is difficult to observe any certain lines
of evidence for the host–guest hydrogen bonding in the Raman
spectra of this work. Similar to the MVK + CH4 clathrate
hydrate, the s-cis form is the geometrically favored conformer for
the sII MVK + O2 or N2 hydrate. As the temperature
increased, both MVK clathrate hydrates started to dissociate and released
MVK molecules from the clathrate phases that existed as solvated solid
phases.7 At 173 K, two additional peaks
at 1618 cm–1 (for C=C stretching) and 1672
cm–1 (for C=O stretching), which implies
solvated s-trans MVK solid by water, were observed
(Figures 5a and 6a). The temperature (173 K) at which the dissociation
of MVK + O2 or N2 hydrate was observed is slightly
higher than that of MVK + CH4 hydrate (153 K)7 even though the equilibrium curves for the three
binary MVK clathrate hydrates (Figures 2–4) show that the MVK
+ CH4 hydrate is the most thermodynamically stable at the
region from 7 to 20 MPa. The Raman spectroscopic results presented
in Figures 5a and 6a, thus, imply that the binary MVK + O2 and N2 hydrates are more stable than the MVK + CH4 hydrate at the ambient pressure.

Figure 5 Raman spectra of (a)
nonirradiated MVK + O2 hydrate
and (b) γ-irradiated MVK + O2 hydrate measured at
various temperatures.

Figure 6 Raman spectra of (a) nonirradiated MVK + N2 hydrate
and (b) γ-irradiated MVK + N2 hydrate measured at
various temperatures.

Figures 5b
and 6b show the Raman spectra of γ-irradiated
samples
of MVK + O2 and N2 hydrates at various temperatures,
respectively. In Figure 5b, two peaks at 1620 and 1674 cm–1, indicating
the signals of s-trans MVK enclathrated in the hydrate
cavity, appear at 133 K. Thus, as with the case of the γ-irradiated
MVK + CH4 hydrate, an intracavity conformational change
from s-cis to s-trans form is observed in the irradiated MVK + O2 hydrate. In our previous report,7 the γ-irradiated MVK + CH4 hydrate shows a change
in the MVK conformation at 133 K (the Raman peaks of s-trans MVK in the hydrate cavity appear), returning the s-trans to s-cis
form in the hydrate cavity at 153 K (the peaks of s-trans MVK in the cavity disappear) and the commencement of hydrate phase
dissociation at 173 K (the peaks of s-trans MVK solvated
appear). The dissociation temperature (173 K) of the γ-irradiated
MVK + CH4 hydrate is higher than that of the unirradiated
sample (153 K). A different aspect of the O2 case is that
the dissociation of γ-irradiated MVK + O2 hydrate
is observed from 153 K, a lower temperature than that before irradiation
(Figure 5). From this
result, the return of s-trans to s-cis form in the cavity of the MVK
+ O2 hydrate (i.e., peak disappearance of s-trans MVK enclathrated at 153 K) cannot be confirmed in the Raman spectra
because the peaks of solvated s-trans MVK already
appear at 153 K (Figure 5b). The temperature at which enclathrated O2 and MVK molecules
is completely released from the hydrate phase (173 K) is also lower
than that of the unirradiated MVK + O2 hydrate (193 K, Figure 5).

In contrast
to the MVK + O2 hydrate, there is no significant
observation for intracavity conformational change in the Raman spectra
of the γ-irradiated MVK + N2 hydrate (Figure 6b). Even though the temperature
was increased from 93 to 173 K, no signal for enclathrated s-trans MVK was observed. At 193 K, the dissociation of the
hydrate phase is first detected, accompanied by the appearance of
the Raman peak of solvated s-trans MVK. Complete
dissociation of the γ-irradiated MVK + N2 hydrate
phase was observed at 223 K, which is substantially higher temperature
than that observed for the unirradiated case (193 K).

From the
comparison of three binary MVK clathrate hydrates with
and without γ-irradiation, it was found that the phenomenon
of intracavity conformational change induced by irradiation was observed
in the CH4 and O2 hydrates and that the elevation
of the dissociation temperature after irradiation was observed in
the CH4 and N2 hydrates. The conformational
changes in the MVK guest and the thermodynamic stability change in
hydrate phases might be independent phenomena relative to each other.
The plausible mechanism of the intracavity conformational change involves
an electron transfer between cavities,7 and thus, how secondary guests or their radical derivatives can
stabilize electrons inside of the hydrate phases induced by γ-irradiation
might determine the occurrence of this phenomenon. Properties such
as molecular electron affinity are important factors for this case.14 It is still difficult to suggest the mechanism
underlying the change in thermodynamic stability of binary MVK hydrate
phases caused by γ-irradiation in this work, and further investigation
of this phenomenon is needed.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we confirmed that the binary MVK clathrate hydrates
with secondary guests, O2 and N2, have a Fd3̅m crystal structure and investigated
the thermodynamic stability of MVK + CH4, O2, and N2 clathrate hydrates. The γ-irradiation may
affect the thermodynamic stability of binary MVK hydrates and the
direction of the effect, whether stabilization or destabilization,
induced by irradiation depended on the secondary guests. The intracavity
conformational change from s-cis to s-trans forms of the MVK guest
was also observed in the γ-irradiated MVK + O2 or
CH4 hydrate, whereas the irradiated MVK + N2 hydrate did not exhibit any conformational changes. The present
findings show that the physicochemical properties of γ-irradiated
binary clathrate hydrate depend on the characteristics of secondary
guest species; selection of a proper secondary guest species is a
key factor for the design of functionalized clathrate hydrate materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Sample Preparations
Deionized water of ultrahigh purity was supplied by Merck (Germany).
MVK was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Inc. and used without further purification.
CH4, O2, and N2 gases were purchased
from Special Gas (Korea) with stated minimum purities of 99.95, 99.95,
and 99.9 mol %, respectively.

Ten grams of 5.0 mol % MVK solution
was initially loaded into the stirring cell. The stirring cell was
a bolted closure-type high-pressure vessel made of stainless steel.
The stirring cell has a vertical magnetic drive agitator so that continuous
stirring is possible when making binary hydrates. After loading the
solution, air existing inside of the cell was flushed out by continuous
injection of gas, which acts as a help-guest molecule to form the
binary MVK clathrate hydrate. After a few seconds, the gas was pressurized
up to around 120 bar by using a microflow syringe pump (Teledyne,
Isco 260D). The temperature of the stirring cell immersed in a circulating
chiller bath (Jeio Tech, RW-2025G) was then slowly lowered until a
sudden pressure drop caused by hydrate formation was detected. After
the hydrate formation started, the cell was kept at 258 K for at least
3 days to complete the hydrate synthesis. To collect the synthesized
sample, the stirring cell was quenched in liquid nitrogen for a few
seconds, and then, the pressure was released to atmospheric pressure.
The collected samples were ground (∼200 μm) in a mortar
at liquid nitrogen temperature and then stored in a liquid nitrogen
tank for HRPD and Raman analyses. Some samples were irradiated at
90 kGy dose (15 kGy per 1 h) using a 60Co γ-ray source
at KAERI in Jeongeup, Korea. The samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen
during the irradiation. The irradiated samples were also used for
Raman spectroscopic analyses.

4.2 Structure
Analysis Using Synchrotron High-Resolution
Powder Diffraction
The HRPD patterns were recorded at the
HRPD beamline (9B) facility of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL)
in Korea. During the measurements, the θ/2θ scan mode
with a fixed time of 2 s, a step size of 0.005° for 2θ
= 5–125°, and the beamline with a wavelength of 1.497
Å were used for each sample. The sample powder stored in liquid
nitrogen was quickly transferred to the sample stage and cooled to
80 K in air, and the experiment was carried out at around 77 K to
minimize possible sample damage. To determine the crystal structures
of the samples, the obtained patterns were analyzed using the Le Bail
fitting method using the profile matching of FullProf Program.38

4.3 Phase Equilibrium Measurements
The
LW–H–V phase equilibria of the binary MVK
+ CH4, O2, and N2 clathrate hydrates
were measured using the P–T trace method in the mechanically stirred high-pressure vessel with
an internal volume of 100 mL. First, the MVK aqueous solution (25
mL) was loaded into the cell. The cell was flushed out by a continuously
injected and vented CH4 (or O2, N2) gas stream so as to remove the air inside of the cell and then
was pressurized up to the target pressure using a microflow syringe
pump (initial pressure condition: 5–21 MPa for CH4, 8–20 MPa for O2, and 8–20 MPa for N2). After the system was stabilized, the cell was cooled at
−1 K/h until the hydrate was sufficiently formed, and then,
the cell was slowly warmed up at 0.1 K/h, which was a sufficient rate
to reach equilibrium in each case. During this hydrate formation–dissociation
process, the pressure and temperature inside of the cell were sensed
using a pressure transducer (Druck, PMP5073, ±0.02% accuracy)
and a four-wire-type Pt-100 Ω probe (±0.05% full-scale
accuracy) and were automatically recorded using a data acquisition
system. When the slope of a tangent line of the P–T curve suddenly decreased, the LW–H–V phase equilibrium point was determined.

4.4 Characterization of Guest Molecules Using
Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman spectra were recorded using
a Horiba Jobin Yvon ARAMIS HR UV/vis/NIR high-resolution dispersive
Raman microscope. A focused 514.53 nm line of an Ar ion laser was
used as an excitation source, and its typical intensity was 30 mW.
The scattered light was dispersed using an 1800 grating of a spectrometer
and was detected using a CCD detector with electrical cooling (203
K). To control the sample temperature, a Linkam (THMS600G) unit was
used, and at each temperature sufficient time was provided to reach
the equilibrium state.
