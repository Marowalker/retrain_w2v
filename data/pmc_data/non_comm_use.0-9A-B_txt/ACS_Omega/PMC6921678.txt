The
variance of sub-20 nm devices is a critical issue for large-scale
integrated circuits. In this work, uniform sub-20 nm Si nanopillar
(NP) arrays with a reduced diameter variance (to ±0.5 nm) and
a cylindrical shape, which can be used for vertical gate-all-around
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, were fabricated.
For the fabrication process, an array of tapered Si NPs with a diameter
of approximately 62.7 nm and a diameter variance of ±2.0 nm was
initially fabricated by an argon fluoride lithography followed by
dry etching. Then, the NPs were oxidized in a self-limiting region.
After the oxide removal, a similar oxidation process was used again
for the NPs. It is determined that by controlling oxidation in the
self-limiting region, the diameter variance can be reduced in the
height direction of Si NPs (as well as shape control) and between
NPs, simultaneously with a controllable diameter decrease. This approach
decreases the variance in size caused by conventional nanoprocessing
and helps overcome the position-dependent variance for 300 mm φ
wafers, which is caused by current semiconductor processing.

1 Introduction
Owing to their superior
electrostatic control and higher integration,
vertical gate-all-around (VGAA) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors (MOSFETs) are expected to replace fin-structured MOSFETs
in the near future. VGAA-MOSFET fabrication based on Si nanopillars
(NPs) with diameters of several tens of nanometers has been reported
by several groups.1−3 The further development of VGAA-MOSFETs requires
the fabrication of sub-20 nm Si NP arrays with a fine-controlled size
and shape and a decreased diameter variance. In addition to their
potential use in VGAA-MOSFETs, Si NPs (and Si nanowires) can be utilized
in battery anodes,4 solar cells,5 thermoelectric devices,6 and image sensors.7 For MOSFET applications,
the cylindrical shape is important for channels when considering full
depletion of the carrier and the effect of the NP sidewall/gate oxide
interface on channel current.1−3,8 Furthermore,
the diameter variance between NPs should be reduced as much as possible.

Oxidation is a key step for Si, both for producing gate oxide and
for cleaning the surface of two-dimensional (2D) planar Si. Retarded
oxidation for Si NPs (also “self-limiting”) has been
widely reported.9−17 According to the traditional theory of oxidation of 2D planar surfaces,18−24 it is generally assumed that retarded oxidation occurs owing to
the inhibition of oxygen diffusion in the oxide and/or the compressive
stress caused by the oxide (i.e., volume expansion from Si to SiO2).9−17 However, we determined that the inhibition of oxidant diffusion
in oxides is insufficient to explain the acceleration of oxidation
after the cracking (broken) of the Si core at the bottom of Si NPs
(Figure 1, ref (25)) without any change in
peripheral oxide for long oxidation durations.25 Recently, we determined that the oxide on the sidewalls
of Si NPs has lower density compared to that formed on a 2D surface
under the same conditions,26 which further
proves that the diffusion inhibition contributes less to the self-limiting
oxidation of Si NPs. Moreover, the compressive stress introduced into
a new oxide by an old oxide is insufficient to explain the formation
of cracks at 1050 °C, which is much higher than the glass-transition
temperature of SiO2.16,25 Therefore, we proposed
and confirmed that the breakage of Si bonds at the Si/SiO2 interface during oxidation causes stress in unreacted Si, which
is intrinsically responsible for the self-limiting behavior of Si
NP,25 whereas the inhibition of oxygen
diffusion in oxide and/or the compressive stress induced by the formed
oxide acts as external factors.

Si nanopillar from the region marked with a white square frame in

In this study, we controlled the oxidation of Si NPs by understanding
the self-limiting oxidation mechanism of Si NPs and fabricated uniform
sub-20 nm Si NP arrays for VGAA-MOSFET applications. In contrast to
the sacrificial oxidation that is widely used in semiconductor processing,
which aims to remove surface damage and metal pollution, we used oxidation
to control the shape and size of Si NPs and to reduce the diameter
variance. Two-step oxidation was applied. In the first step, oxidation
was followed by oxide etching using a hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution,
which reduces the compressive stress from the formed oxide.18−24 Then, a second oxidation process was applied. Two-step oxidation
has been previously used to reduce the size of Si NPs.27,28 However, oxidation in a self-limiting region for precise size/shape
control and variance reduction are less reported.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication Process
Figure 1a–c
shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images with different magnifications of
Si NP arrays on a chip during focused ion beam (FIB) processing. Here,
the white dot arrays in Figure 1b observed on the chip are the top view of Si NPs with a SiGe
deposition layer (SiGe protects Si NPs) in the non-FIB processing
region.25,29 For the FIB processing region, the longitudinal
cross section (side view) of Si NPs is observed on a film produced
by FIB. A ∼0.4 μm conductive carbon layer deposited during
FIB processing can be observed on the upper region of the film. Figure 1d shows the typical
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) bright-field image of the longitudinal
cross section of a Si NP. Figure 1b,c shows that numerous Si NPs can be simultaneously
obtained by FIB processing, which can be used to evaluate variance.

Figure 2 shows TEM
images of a 62.7 nm-diameter Si NP (a) after the fabrication by ArF
lithography and dry etching, (b) after first oxidation at 900 °C
for 3.5 h, (c) after etching with 5% HF, and (d) after second oxidation
at 1000 °C for 10 min. After lithography and etching, the Si
NP exhibited a tapered shape in the vertical cross section, whereas
after oxidation at 900 °C for 3.5 h, a cylindrical shape was
obtained. The tapered and cylindrical shapes were confirmed by SEM
observations on Si NP arrays. The cylindrical shape of Si NP remains
after each process step, as shown in Figure 2b–d, with decreasing diameter, reaching
approximately 18 nm at the center height of Si NPs. Gandhi et al.30 also fabricated 18 nm-diameter Si NPs for VGAA-MOSFETs
by deep ultraviolet lithography combined with reactive ion etching
and subsequent oxidation. However, the sidewalls of their 18 nm-diameter
NPs were uneven (Figure 1, ref (30)). Han et
al.31 also reported the fabrication of
sub-20 nm Si NPs for VGAA-MOSFETs, but the shape of the reported Si
NPs required further improvements.

oxidation at 1000 °C for 10 min.

2.2 Variance Reduction Mechanism
Here,
we explain the mechanism of diameter variance reduction and shape/size
control for the fabrication of Si NPs by the self-limiting oxidation
process. As indicated in our previous work,25 the oxidation of Si to form SiO2 first breaks Si–Si
bonds at the Si surface, which shrinks the remaining Si–Si
bonds. This shrinkage causes compressive stress in residual Si, which
results in more energy needed to break Si–Si bonds at the Si/SiO2 interface for the subsequent oxidation and, thus, in a decrease
in the oxidation rate. The stress increases as oxidation continues,
which further decreases the oxidation rate. Because Si oxidizes layer-by-layer,
the direction of oxidation-induced stress is perpendicular to the
oxidation surface. For a 2D planar surface, such as a wafer surface,
the oxidation-induced stress can relax in the depth direction of the
Si wafer. However, for oxidation at the sidewall of a Si NP, relaxation
conflicts occur in the two diagonal directions in the transverse cross
section of an NP.25Figure 3 shows a schematic diagram of oxidation-induced
stress in the transverse cross section [(001) surface] of Si NP for
which the array of Si atoms and bonds of the (001) surface was simplified
from an sp3 structure to a 2D structure, as described in
a prior work.13 Because the circle transverse
cross section (red dashed circles) can be considered to be composed
of many adjacent surfaces with different crystal orientations (here,
simplified to eight Si/SiO2 interfaces marked with dark
dotted lines) and crystal Si has an sp3 structure, the
crystalline orientation has less influence on oxidation of sidewalls
of Si NPs with a circle transverse cross section. As oxidation continues,
the interface changes as x of Rx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4...) increases, which is similar
to the layer-by-layer oxidation of a 2D surface. The Si–Si
bond shrinkage transfers from the outside circle to the inside circle,
which relaxes the stress in Si that is induced by oxidation.25 The pink arrows named Fx and
Fx′ (here x = 1, 2, 3, and
4 for simplified eight interfaces) stand for the stress induced by
oxidation in the two diagonal directions. For thinner NPs, because
they offer less space (Si volume) for stress relaxation, stronger
self-limiting occurs. Therefore, under the same oxidation conditions,
thinner NPs have a lower oxidation rate compared to thicker NPs during
the self-limiting oxidation process.

Figure 3 Schematic diagram of oxidation-induced
stress in the transverse
cross section [(001) surface] of Si nanopillar.

Figure 4 shows the
diameters obtained for Si NPs with different initial diameters (e.g.,
50.9, 62.7, 78, 95.8, and 152.5 nm) prepared under different oxidation
conditions. Nonoxidation data are also shown as a dark dotted line
for comparison. The line slopes for the initial diameters larger than
78 nm exhibit a slight change, whereas the line slope changes more
for the samples with diameters smaller than 78 nm. The greater change
in the slope for thinner NPs is observed because thinner NPs have
a lower oxidation rate in the self-limiting regions, as discussed
above. Here, we focus on the slope between 50.9 and 62.7 nm, where
the initial diameter difference (the practical variance among Si NPs
for a certain designed size should be smaller than the difference
between 50.9 and 62.7 nm) is denoted as ΔD0. ΔD0 is constant regardless
of the oxidation process. However, the diameter becomes different
after oxidation, which is denoted as ΔDA1 (=ΔD0), ΔDA2, ΔDA3,
and ΔDA4 for without oxidation and
with oxidation at 900 °C for 67 min, 3.5 h, and 5 h, respectively.
As introduced in our previous work,25 cracking
is observed at the bottom of the 50.9 nm-diameter Si NP after oxidation
at 900 °C for 5 h. Thus, without the breakage of Si NPs, ΔDA4 will not decrease even with additional oxidation
under the experimental conditions. The decrease in ΔDA indicates that the diameter difference (diameter
variance) decreases as the oxidation continues, which is attributed
to the mechanism that thinner NPs have a lower oxidation rate compared
to thicker NPs during the self-limiting oxidation process, as discussed
above. Based on the ratio of ΔDA to ΔD0, ΔDA2 and ΔDA3 decrease
to 50 and 27% of ΔD0, respectively,
with a minimum value of 19% for ΔDA4 under the experimental conditions. Therefore, the diameter variance
between Si NPs can be reduced by applying a self-limiting process.

different oxidation conditions.

The abovementioned mechanism contributes to a decrease in the variance
caused by conventional nanoprocessing and helps overcome the position-dependent
variance for 300 mm φ wafers caused by current semiconductor
processing. Furthermore, Si NPs fabricated by conventional lithography
and etching processes exhibit a tapered structure, as shown in Figure 2a, with different
diameters at different heights, which can be considered as a diameter
variance. Thus, this variance can be decreased by applying the abovementioned
self-limiting oxidation process. Importantly, this variance-reducing
oxidation process should be performed in a self-limiting region, as
shown in Figure 4.
Based on the abovementioned mechanisms, we performed oxidation at
900 °C for 3.5 h for the first step and fabricated cylindrical
Si NPs, as shown in Figure 2b. The top and bottom regions of the Si NP shown in Figure 2b exhibit a slight
oxidation delay, which is attributed to a large Si–Si bond
energy near the edge (so-called edge effect),29 that can be adjusted by a further self-limiting oxidation, as described
below. In addition, the abovementioned mechanism is also available
for the lateral Si NPs.

2.3 Variance Reduction between
Si Nanopillars
Figure 5a shows
the TEM images of Si NP arrays after the two-step oxidation process
described in Figure 2 (oxidation at 900 °C for 3.5 h, 5% HF etching, and oxidation
at 1000 °C for 10 min). Figure 5b,c shows the magnified TEM image on the left and right
sides of Figure 5a,
respectively. All NPs in the array have uniform structures. Figure 5d shows the magnified
TEM image of a Si NP shown in Figure 5a, while Figure 5e,f shows high-resolution TEM images of top and bottom regions,
respectively. It is determined that the single crystal remains after
the process as described in Figure 2. As discussed above, the white dot arrays observed
in Figure 1a,b are
the top view of Si NPs with deposited SiGe. More than 60,000 NPs of
each diameter were fabricated on one chip. We confirmed that for the
62.7 nm-diameter and thicker NPs subjected to the processing described
in Figure 2, all of
the dots remained, which suggest that all NPs remain after the proposed
process. Thus, this process is suitable for mass production. However,
for the 50.9 nm-diameter NPs, not all NPs remained even after the
lithography and etching processes. Therefore, in this study, we estimate
the variance only for 62.7 nm-diameter Si NPs.

arrays after the process described
in Figure 2; (b, c)
magnified TEM image of the (b) left and (c) right sides of (a); (d)
TEM image of a Si nanopillar in (a); (e, f) high-resolution TEM bright-field
image of the (e) top and (f) bottom regions of the Si nanopillar in
(d).

Figure 6 shows the
diameters measured from TEM images at heights of T:40, T:100, and
T:130 nm for 16 Si NPs, as shown in Figure 5a. The dashed lines show the average diameter
at each height. The diameters measured for the 16 NPs are within ±0.5
nm of the average diameter [we believe that instead of the deviation
from the average value, it is better to estimate the variance in semiconductor
processing compared to the standard deviation, although the standard
deviation here is small (∼0.3)] at all heights, except for
T:130 nm (within ±0.7 nm), which will not be used for VGAA-MOSFET
channels. The variance for 62.7 nm-diameter Si NPs after lithography
and etching, which is estimated for the same region of a 300 mm φ
wafer, is ±2.0 nm, based on the investigations by both SEM observations
and TEM images. Therefore, the diameter variance decreases by 75%
after the process described in Figure 2 (oxidation at 900 °C for 3.5 h, 5% HF etching,
and oxidation at 1000 °C for 10 min), which is close to the value
obtained from Figure 4. Furthermore, the average diameters at the heights of T:40, T:100,
and T:130 nm are 16.8, 17.9, and 20.9 nm, respectively. The Si NPs
obtained prior to the two-step oxidation presented in this work have
diameters of approximately 57.1, 62.7, and 69.0 nm at the corresponding
heights (oxidation and etching change the NP height). In addition,
the diameter difference (diameter variance) at the two higher points
(T:40 and T:100) varies between 5.6 and 1.1 nm, which represents an
80.4% decrease in variance. This value also confirms the assumption
in Figure 4. Importantly,
for the heights from T:40 to T:100 nm, the diameter difference is
approximately 1.1 nm for a length of 60 nm, which is suitable for
the fabrication of VGAA-MOSFETs with channel lengths on the order
of 10 nm or less. The diameter difference for the two lower points
(T:100 and T:130) decreases from 6.3 to 3.0 nm, which can be further
decreased by adjusting the experimental conditions, as discussed below.

at different heights for 16 Si nanopillars shown in Figure 5a.

2.4 Variance Reduction in the Height Direction
of Si Nanopillar (Shape Control)
Figure 7 shows the diameter measured from TEM images
at the heights of T:40, T:70, T:100, T:130, and T:160 nm for the four
samples: (1) 62.7 nm-diameter and (2) 50.9 nm-diameter Si NPs after
the two-step oxidation process (oxidation at 900 °C for 3.5 h
oxidation, etching, and oxidation at 1000 °C for 10 min) described
in Figure 2 and (3)
62.7 nm-diameter and (4) 50.9 nm-diameter Si NPs, after a similar
process (oxidation at 900 °C for 3.5 h, etching, and oxidation
at 900 °C for 2.5 h). The inset is the TEM image for each sample.
It was determined that both (3) and (4) have longer cylindrical shapes
(diameter variance is lower at different heights) than those of (1)
and (2). This result is obtained because more self-limiting oxidation
occurs at 900 °C for 2.5 h during the second oxidation step compared
to that at 1000 °C for 10 min.9−17,25 Thus, the diameter variance in
the height direction of Si NP (also considered as shape control) can
be reduced by self-limiting oxidation. Specifically, sample (3) has
almost the same diameter (∼14.8 nm) at all measured heights,
which satisfies the requirement of the fabrication of VGAA-MOSFETs
with any channel length. The diameter decreases to ∼11 nm for
sample (4), but the cracking of the Si core at the bottom of Si NPs
was observed for some NPs under this condition. It is assumed that
this cracking was produced during the second oxidation step (oxidation
at 900 °C for 2.5 h) after the first oxidation at 900 °C
for 3.5 h, because cracking was observed at the bottom of the 50.9
nm-diameter Si NP after the oxidation at 900 °C for 5 h.25 In addition, we previously determined that in
the self-limiting region, the oxidation at the sidewall of Si NPs
is initially retarded and eventually stops at a certain size depending
on the initial size and oxidation conditions, and further oxidation
produces cracks at the bottom of NPs.25 Therefore, it is expected that a designated diameter (even to sub-10
nm) of Si NP arrays with a reduced diameter variance for both the
height direction of Si NP and between NPs can be achieved by the abovementioned
mechanisms.

Figure 7 Diameters at the heights of T:40, T:70, T:100, T:130, and T:160
nm for four samples: (1) 62.7 and (2) 50.9 nm Si nanopillars after
the process (oxidation at 900 °C for 3.5 h, etching, and oxidation
at 1000 °C for 10 min) described in Figure 2 and (3) 62.7 and (4) 50.9 nm Si nanopillars
after a similar process (oxidation at 900 °C for 3.5 h, etching,
and oxidation at 900 °C for 2.5 h). The insets show TEM images
for each sample.

3 Conclusions
In summary, by understanding and controlling a self-limiting oxidation
process of Si NPs, using a two-step oxidation after the lithography
and etching processes, we fabricated uniform sub-20 nm Si NP arrays
with a decreased diameter variance and controllable shape/size, which
overcome one of the most crucial issues in the mass production of
VGAA-MOSFETs for large-scale integrated circuits.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Fabrication
Argon fluoride
(ArF) lithography with a subsequent dry-etching process can produce
NPs with a diameter of approximately 60–160 nm, with a controllable
shape and mass production yield, as shown in Figure 8a. By applying ArF lithography with a subsequent
dry-etching process in a two-step oxidation (Figure 8b), sub-20 nm Si NP arrays were fabricated
as follows. (1) Si3N4-capped Si NP arrays with
a height of approximately 200 nm were fabricated with different diameters
(e.g., 50.9, 62.7, 78, 95.8, and 152.5 nm at the center of the NPs,
and the NPs larger than 78 nm were used as references) on a 300-mm
φ wafer (p-type, resistivity: 10.38 Ω·cm) by ArF
lithography and dry-etching processes. (2) A chip cut from the wafer
was oxidized in a furnace in pure dry oxygen at 900 °C for 3.5
h as the first oxidation step. (3) Then, the oxidized chip was immersed
in 5% HF to remove the oxide. (4) After the removal of the oxide,
the samples were oxidized again as a second oxidation step, but the
temperature and duration were varied. Further details were introduced
in our previous work.25,29

4.2 Evaluation
The
evaluation of oxide
thickness and diameter was performed at longitudinal cross sections
of the Si NPs using TEM. The TEM samples (with a thickness of less
than 100 nm) were fabricated using an FIB. Because the height of NPs
changes owing to the oxidation on the bottom surface, the measurements
were carried out at 40, 70, 100 (middle of NP), 130, and 160 nm from
the top surface, which were denoted as T:40, T:70, T:100, T:130, and
T:160 nm, respectively.
