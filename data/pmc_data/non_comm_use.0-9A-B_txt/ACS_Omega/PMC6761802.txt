Adulteration of edible
oils by the manufacturers has been found
frequently in modern societies. Due to the complexity of the chemical
contents in edible oils, it is challenging to quantitatively determine
the extent of adulteration and prove the authenticity of edible oils.
In this study, a robust and simple MALDI-TOF-MS platform for rapid
fingerprinting of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in edible oils was developed,
where spectral similarity analysis was performed to quantitatively
reveal correlations among edible oils in the chemical level. Specifically,
we proposed oil networking, a spectral similarity-based illustration,
which enabled reliable classifications of tens of commercial edible
oils from vegetable and animal origins. The strategy was superior
to traditional multivariate statistics due to its high sensitivity
in probing subtle changes in TAG profiles, as further demonstrated
by the success in determination of the adulterated lard in a food
fraud in Taiwan. Finally, we showed that the platform allowed quantitative
assessment of the binary mixture of olive oil and canola oil, which
is a common type of olive oil adulteration in the market. Overall,
these results suggested a novel strategy for chemical fingerprint-based
quality control and authentication of oils in the food industry.

Introduction
Since the introduction
of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), it has been profoundly
applied to the analysis of different kinds of biomolecules, including
proteins, peptides,1 metabolites,2 carbohydrates,3 and
lipids.4 MALDI produces mostly singly charged
ions with only minimal fragmentations, giving relatively simple spectra
at m/z > 500. Therefore, the detection of intact
biomolecules and the subsequent spectral interpretation of complicated
chemical mixtures become feasible using MALDI-TOF-MS.5

Food characterization is one of the prominent applications
of MALDI-TOF-MS.6−13 For example, whey proteins have been proposed as biomarkers for
identifying bovine and ewe milk adulteration of water buffalo mozzarella
cheese,6 and peptides can serve as biomarkers
to determine meat authenticity.8 In these
cases, only one or very few ion peaks were used as the markers for
the assessments of food contents.6−9 However, for the adulteration by combining
two or more chemically similar mixtures, a single biomarker may not
be sufficient as many ion species are likely present. In this context,
MS spectral profiles, for example, a set of peaks, are thus used to
represent as the markers of specific substances.10−12 Data processing
by multivariate analysis on MS spectral profiles helps us capture
important spectral features as it simplifies the complexity in high-dimensional
MS profiles while retaining significant patterns. Principle component
analysis (PCA), the most common approach for the preliminary classification
of sample groups, can simplify the complexity in high-dimensional
MS profiles while retaining significant patterns.14 However, when the number of sample groups becomes large,
PCA could only offer obscure discrimination, often leading to ambiguous
and inconclusive classifications.15 Supervised
models, for example, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA),
enable multicategory classification for complex datasets, whereas
the classification results are highly dependent on parameter optimization.16

Compared to qualitative statistics, spectral
similarity analysis
allows the quantitative assessment of resemblance among multiple spectra.17,18 In particular, cosine similarity analysis, one of the simplest mathematical
operations, provides a strategy to measure mass spectral similarity
in the form of a cosine value (cos θ). In general, the cos θ
value is the normalized dot product between a reference spectrum and
a target spectrum, in which the MS spectra are viewed as multidimensional
vectors. In the past years, cosine similarity analysis has been widely
used as a scoring system when searching tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra
against databases in metabolomics19 and
proteomics,20 evaluating MS spectral reproducibility,21 and assessing oil quality.22

Edible oils are a mixture of lipids of plant, animal,
or marine
origin. Each type of edible oil has its characteristic fatty acid
(FA) composition, while the majority of FAs exist in the form of triacylglycerols
(TAGs) that contribute to 95% weight of edible oils.23 Edible oils provide essential nutrients in daily life.
However, the quality control of edible oils is not fully secured in
the food industry, causing numerous oil fraud events worldwide.24 One of the common issues is oil adulteration,
in which expensive edible oils are mixed with cheap ones.7,24,25 The gutter oil event involves
the use of recycled cooking oils, which can cause potential health
problems. Driven by the emergence in determining the authenticity
of edible oils, many analytical approaches have been thus proposed
in recent years.7,9,13,25,26 However, many
of the targeted detections of biomarkers or toxins showed less effectiveness
to solve modern edible oil frauds because of unpredicted alterations
of chemical compositions in abnormal oils.27 As a result, developing techniques that allow the investigation
of chemical fingerprints has become popular and promising.9,22,28−30 In particular,
MALDI-MS plays a critical role in chemical profiling of edible oils
as it provides ease in sample preparation, high-throughput analysis
without chromatographic separation, high sensitivity, and broad coverage
of molecules, such as phospholipids7 and
TAGs.26,31 To date, interpreting chemical fingerprints
of edible oils obtained by MALDI-TOF-MS has been demonstrated with
multivariate statistics, including hierarchical clustering,26 PCA,9,28 and PLS-DA.30 In this regard, qualitative differentiations
of edible oils were made possible by the visually interpretable plots,
but the conclusions inferred by these approaches were largely based
on subjective examinations.32 As a result,
an approach allowing quantitative assessments to determine the significant
discrimination on samples is still necessary and thus appropriate
for developing a precise quality control (QC) system.

In the
present study, we demonstrated an approach combining MALDI-TOF-MS
and cosine similarity analysis of TAG fingerprints, which allows a
rapid and quantitative comparison of edible oils (Figure 1). In addition, we introduced
“oil networking”, a visual illustration of TAG similarities,
to facilitate classifications of edible oils. The platform was comprehensively
demonstrated by a dataset of edible oils from various vegetables and
animals and further utilized for the detection of the adulterated
oils. Details of the sample preparation, instrumental settings, mathematical
processing, and data interpretation are elaborated in the following
sections.

MALDI-TOF-MS and spectral similarity analysis. The TAG fingerprints
of edible oils were obtained using the developed protocol, and pairwise
spectral similarities were evaluated based on the cosine similarity.

Results and Discussion
Rapid Profiling of TAG
Fingerprints in Edible Oils with MALDI-MS
The workflow for
MALDI-TOF-MS-based approach to investigate TAG
fingerprints of edible oils was demonstrated as shown in Figure 1. Briefly, edible
oils were dissolved in chloroform, mixed with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (DHB) matrix solution, and deposited onto the stainless steel
target plate for subsequent MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Details of sample
preparation are elaborated in Experimental Section and the Supporting Information. To evaluate
the efficacy of the method, we tested a QC sample consisting of palm
oil and soybean oil (v/v = 3/5), which contains the main TAG species
commonly found in most edible oils. Figure 2A shows the MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum of the
QC sample, where multiple TAG species were observed in the form of
[M + Na]+ ions with a good signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).
Specifically, these TAGs were resolved as three major groups of the
total carbon number of 50 (m/z 850–870), 52
(m/z 870–890), or 54 (m/z 890–920), and the degree of saturation (i.e., the number
of carbon–carbon double bonds) varied as indicated by the m/z shift of 2 in each group. These results were consistent
with the literature, in which TAGs of edible oils are readily detected
using MALDI-TOF MS.9 The TAG species, including
the carbon chain lengths and the number of double bonds, are putatively
identified and summarized in Table S1.

similarity analysis. (A) Representative TAG fingerprint of the quality
control (QC) sample (palm oil/soybean oil = 3:5, v/v). TAGs were observed
as sodium adducts. The carbon number and double bond number (CN:DB)
for each TAG species are shown. (B) Quality control chart of 15 technical
replicates of the QC sample in three consecutive days. The mean cosine
value (μ) from 15 QC samples is shown as the black dashed line
(cos θ = 0.99716), with a standard deviation (σ) of 0.00149.
The warning limit (μ-2σ, cos θ = 0.99418) is shown
by the blue dashed line, and the control limit (μ-3σ,
cos θ = 0.99269) is shown by the red dashed line.

Fingerprint-Based Quality Control
To realize the instrumental
stability in obtaining oil TAG fingerprints using our MALDI-TOF-MS
method, we tested 15 technical replicates of QC samples in three consecutive
days. As a result, the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of 15 QC samples were
obtained, showing highly similar TAG fingerprints (Figure S2). Herein, we applied cosine similarity analysis
to quantitatively realize technical variations among these spectra.
The 15 TAG fingerprints were normalized by total ion intensities and
averaged to serve as the consensus spectrum. Subsequently, pairwise
cosine similarity analyses were performed between the consensus spectrum
and each of the 15 replicates (Table S2). Such a process allowed us to construct the Shewhart QC chart (Figure 2B), which showed
the variations of spectral similarities, denoted as cos θ values,
in the 15 technical replicates. We also obtained the mean similarity
(μ) and its standard deviation (σ) as 0.99716 and 0.00149,
respectively. In fact, the defined similarity of zero (cos θ
= 0) indicates that the two fingerprints are absolutely different,
whereas two identical fingerprints yield a similarity of unity (cos
θ = 1). In this regard, we concluded that our MALDI-TOF-MS platform
enabled the routine acquisition of oil TAG fingerprints with great
reproducibility. Furthermore, we defined the resolving power of our
platform to differentiate two nonidentical TAG fingerprints as cos
θ = 0.99269 (μ-3σ, the red dashed line in Figure 2B); that is, for
two TAG fingerprints of the similarity lower than 0.9927, they were
significantly considered nonidentical in this study.

Oil Networking
of Various Edible Oils
The proposed
platform combining MALDI-TOF-MS and cosine similarity analysis could
be implemented to study real oil samples. As a pilot study, we collected
16 common species of edible oils from the local market, including
15 vegetable oils and 1 animal oil, and their TAG fingerprints were
thoroughly investigated (Figure S3). Subsequently,
cosine similarity analyses were performed on each pair of TAG fingerprints
(Table S3). Herein, we demonstrated oil
networking as a visual strategy to systematically categorize edible
oils based on their TAG similarities. Such MS spectral networking
has been profoundly used for investigating similarities of tandem
mass spectral (MS/MS) fragments in metabolomics studies19 and was used for the analysis of chemical fingerprints
acquired in the full MS level in this study. Figure 3 shows the resulting oil network where 16
edible oil samples, denoted as nodes, were connected if the paired
TAG similarities were higher than 0.80. The oil network reflected
the relationship of the TAG profiles of each oil. First, we showed
that four oils, including hazelnut oil, camellia oil, canola oil,
and olive oil, were clustered based on a dominant C54:3 TAG (m/z 907.8) in their MALDI-TOF-MS spectra. Importantly, hazelnut
oil, camellia oil, and canola oil are frequent targets for the identification
of adulterated olive oils because they have similar FA profiles and
physicochemical properties.29,33,34 The respective TAG species herein were in agreement with those obtained
by ambient ionization sources, such as desorption electrospray ionization
(DESI)35 and direct analysis in real time
(DART),36 where TAGs were present in the
form of [M + NH4]+ ions.

Figure 3 Oil network of the standard
edible oils. The edible oils, denoted
by nodes, were connected by edges if the pairwise TAG similarities
were higher than 0.80. The color and thickness of edges were adjusted
according to the cosine similarity. The complete pairwise TAG similarities
are available in Table S3.

In the central part of the network, there were 10 other edible
oils clustered separately. This stark contrast was not surprising
as they were mostly made up of the same TAG species, such as unsaturated
C54 TAGs and some minor C52 TAGs, instead of C54:3 TAG. We further
pointed out that black sesame oil and sesame oil shared the most similar
TAG fingerprints (cos θ = 0.9932) in the current oil network.
In fact, black sesame oil and sesame oil are both produced from sesame
seeds, whereas a roasting step is applied in processing the former.
Additionally, a previous report showed that there was no obvious difference
in the FA compositions in TAGs of sesame oils prepared from unroasted
and roasted seeds,37 and this could also
be true in the TAG fingerprint. Interestingly, palm oil formed an
isolated node due to its distinct TAG fingerprint consisting of abundant
C50:1 TAG (m/z 855.7) and C52:2 TAG (m/z 881.7).13,38 Lard possessed predominant C52:2 TAG and
C52:1 TAG (m/z 883.7) in its MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum,39 making it also segregated from the others. These
results showed the effectiveness of our cosine similarity networking-based
strategy as the PCA and hierarchical clustering analysis to the present
dataset also showed similar cluster profiles (Figure S4).

Classification of Edible Oils with Oil Networking
The
obtained TAG fingerprints then serve as the standard dataset for classifications
to the new oil samples. In this study, we tested additional 21 edible
oil samples from 6 plant sources present in the prebuilt dataset.
The resulting MALDI-TOF-MS spectra are provided in Figures S5–S10. For ease of discussion, the newly tested
samples were marked with capital letters in the end of labels, such
as soybean A (Figure S6) and canola B (Figure S8). First, PCA and hierarchical clustering
were preliminarily applied to the combined TAG fingerprints, giving
the TAG similarities in the oils of the same species (Figure S11). To quantify the TAG similarities,
we subsequently applied cosine similarity analysis to the combined
dataset of 37 edible oils. The pairwise TAG similarities are shown
in Table S4, and the similarity correlations
are visualized as an oil network in Figure 4, where oils of TAG similarities higher than
0.95 were connected. Remarkably, in the oil network, most of the edible
oils from the same species were closely clustered. For example, canola
oil, olive oil, camellia oil, and hazelnut oil were all mainly made
of C52:2/C54:3 mixtures, and their corresponding nodes were thus clustered.
In-depth inspection of the pairwise TAG similarities revealed that
19 of the 21 newly tested samples, except for grapeseed A and olive
E, showed the highest TAG similarities to their same-origin oils in
the prebuilt dataset (Table S4). Although
the TAG fingerprint of grapeseed A had a high similarity to that of
the standard grapeseed oil (cos θ = 0.984), it was more similar
to those of the soybean oils, as inferred by the network. In this
case, it might be the consequence that soybean oil and grapeseed oil
had similar FA chain compositions in TAGs, in which C18:2 FA was the
most dominant species followed by C18:1 FA and C16:0 FA.40 For olive E, interestingly, it had a distinct
TAG fingerprint (Figure S9). As a result,
it had a relative low TAG similarity compared to other oils and thus
presented as an independent node in the network. In fact, among all
the olive oil samples, olive E was the only one produced through the
refining process, which probably altered its TAG composition.41 Collectively, we demonstrated the capability
of spectral networking to effectively classify edible oils based on
spectral similarities in their TAG fingerprints.

Figure 4 Oil network of the combined
dataset of the standard and newly tested
edible oils. Additional 21 edible oils from 6 species present in the
prebuilt dataset were incorporated to the previous oil network and
labeled by capital characters by the ends of the names. The nodes
were connected if the pairwise TAG similarities were higher than 0.95.
The pairwise TAG similarities are available in Table S4.

Applying Oil Networking
for Gutter Oil Differentiation
In 2014, a gutter oil scandal
occurred in Taiwan, in which the lard
was adulterated with the recycled cooking oil. In this fraud, however,
the official examinations of edible oils by the Taiwan Food and Drug
Administration (TFDA), including the detection of toxic contaminants
and heavy metal substances, had failed to capture the adulterated
lards in advance.27 With the lack of an
officially effective strategy to solve the problem, we thus hypothesized
that TAG fingerprints could be used as markers to differentiate the
adulterated lard from the natural one. In this regard, we further
incorporated six adulterated lard oil samples (TFDA A–F) and
one commercial lard (Lard A) into the previous oil network (Figures S12 and S13). Notably,
we found that all the lard samples had similar TAG fingerprints and
thereby clustered closely, independent with other oils (Figure 5A; the full network is available
in Figure S13). Subsequent inspection of
the pairwise TAG similarities showed that the two normal lards had
indistinguishable TAG profiles (cos θ = 0.9940, higher than
the defined resolving power of 0.9927), while they were significantly
differentiated from the adulterated samples (cos θ < 0.990)
(Figure 5B and Table S5). Importantly, such precise differentiation
was complementary to the results using PCA and hierarchical clustering,
where quantitative discrimination between the normal and gutter oils
was not feasible (Figure S14). Overall,
these results indicated that the changes in the chemical profiles
of the gutter oils might be very subtle, making it challenging to
verify through multivariate analysis. We believe that, as demonstrated
by the representative fraud in Taiwan, the innovative oil networking
platform is of immediate usefulness in identifying adulterated edible
oils.

Figure 5 TAG similarity analysis between the normal lards and the lards
adulterated with gutter oils. (A) In the present network, one commercial
lard (Lard A) and six adulterated lard oil samples (TFDA A–F)
were incorporated and showed high TAG similarities to the standard
lard. (B) Paired TAG similarities between the standard lard and the
tested lard samples.

Quantitative Assessment
of the Canola–Olive Oil Mixture
Adulteration of edible
oil by intentionally adding a cheaper one
has been a common issue in the food industry, where the most challenging
task is to characterize, as the virgin and cheaper ones usually possess
a similar chemical nature.7,42 Here, we further investigated
the ability of our platform for the analysis of oil mixtures. First,
we built an adulterated oil model by manually adding the canola oil
(the cheaper oil) into the extra virgin olive oil. As a result, six
oil samples with various proportions of the canola oil (0, 20, 40,
60, 80, and 100%) were readily tested with our platform, and their
TAG fingerprints were revealed (Figure 6A). For each sample, its TAG similarity was calculated
against the pure oil sample (i.e., 100% olive or 0% olive). The resulting
TAG similarities were plotted against oil compositions to construct
a calibration curve (Figure 6B), in which how the TAG fingerprint of the pure olive oil
altered upon the addition of the canola oil was revealed. Interestingly,
we found that the change of TAG similarity was not linearly related
to the mixed proportion of the canola oil; instead, a quadratic function
fitted the curve with R2 ≈ 0.99.
This observation could be simply understood because the nature of
cosine similarity was the calculation of a dot product between two
vectors but not a linear mathematical operation. More importantly,
here, it was the TAG fingerprint that served as the marker to determine
the adulterated proportions. Compared to the reported methods using
the intensity ratio between two compounds to detect the targeted adulteration,7,9 the demonstrated spectral similarity analysis shows great potential
in preventing unknown adulteration because multiple compounds as well
as their relative abundances were comprehensively taken into concern.

Figure 6 Quantitative
analysis of the olive–canola oil mixture. The
olive oils were manually added with various quantities of the canola
oils, giving six samples with the olive oil proportions ranging from
0 to 100%. (A) Representative TAG fingerprints of the mixtures. (B)
Pairwise TAG similarities were assessed between each sample and the
pure oil (100% olive oil, shown as a red line; 100% canola oil, shown
as a blue line). Error bars represent standard deviations of six technical
replicates. The coefficients of the fitted quadratic functions were
as follows: a, −0.13; b, 0.31; c, 0.82; a′, −0.19;
b′, 0.37; c′, 0.82.

Conclusions
A reliable MALDI-TOF-MS platform for the rapid
analysis of TAG
fingerprints in edible oils was demonstrated. Herein, cosine similarity
analysis was incorporated into the pipeline, allowing quantitative
differentiations of edible oils from various sources. Empowered by
the sensitivity to probe subtle but crucial changes in the TAG fingerprints,
the platform thus provides systematic classifications of the edible
oils with robustness. Such an innovative approach paved a new way
to comprehensively define the authenticity of edible oils, as further
demonstrated by its application in solving a notorious fraud of adulterated
lard in Taiwan. The data processing algorithm to create the profiling-based
networking is also supplemented for future uses. On top of that, the
mixture of canola oil and olive oil, which is a common form of oil
adulteration in the market, was proved to be easily recognized quantitatively.
This work provides an ability to externalize and fingerprint-based
quality control of edible oils in the chemistry level. Such a robust
and simplified approach may enable standardized tests and typings
of agricultural products and manufacture foods at a low cost.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Chemicals
Oil samples including olive
oil, camellia oil, hazelnut oil, canola oil, rice bran oil, black
sesame oil, pumpkinseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, walnut oil, corn
oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, grapeseed oil, and lards
were purchased from the local supermarket. The lard samples with adulteration
of gutter oils were provided by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration
(TFDA). All samples were stored in the dark under 4 °C. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic
acid (DHB) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were purchased from Alfa
Aesar (Heysham, U.K.). Acetone was purchased from Duksan Pure Chemicals
(Ansan, Korea). Cesium iodide (CsI) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Missouri, USA). Acetonitrile (ACN) and chloroform (CHCl3) were purchased from Avantor (Pennsylvania, USA).

Sample Preparation
for MALDI-TOF-MS
Oil samples were
dissolved in chloroform to 100 mg/mL, and 3 μL of each oil sample
was added into 27 μL of DHB solution (20 mg/mL in acetone and
0.2% TFA) and vortexed. An aliquot of 1 μL of the mixture was
loaded onto the Bruker MTP AnchorChip 384 plate. For mass calibration,
CsI solution (1 M in 50% ACN) was added into an equal volume of DHB
solution (10 mg/mL in 50% ACN and 0.1% TFA), and 1 μL of the
mixture was loaded onto the target plate. All the samples were dried
under vacuum for at least 10 min prior to analysis.

Instrument
Parameters of MALDI-TOF-MS
All experiments
were performed using a MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Autoflex Speed
MALDI TOF/TOF system, Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a frequency-tripled
Nd:YAG SmartBeam-II laser (355 nm) and operated in positive polarity
and reflectron mode. FlexControl 3.4 software was used for spectral
acquisition. The spectra were acquired using the following instrumental
parameters: mass range at m/z 400–1500,
deflection suppressed up to m/z 380, laser power
at 70%, shots accumulated to 1000 replicates, laser frequency at 200
Hz, detector gain set at 10× (2950 V), laser attenuator at 80%,
and laser modulator set to medium.

Cosine Similarity Analysis
The spectral similarity
between two spectra was evaluated by pairwise cosine similarity. Taking
two spectral vectors ( and ), for example,
the cosine similarity was
calculated by the normalized dot product: cosθ(, ) = ( · )/||||.

Data Visualization
by Oil Networking
Raw MALDI-MS spectra
were preliminarily viewed by flexAnalysis 3.3 software (Bruker Daltonics)
and exported as .txt files for spectral processing using OriginPro
8.5 software. Each spectrum within the mass range of m/z 850.2–950.2 (TAG fingerprint region) was extracted and dimensionally
reduced to evenly spaced m/z 1.0 by the averaged
intensity, resulting in a 100-dimension vector. For each edible oil
sample, three technical replicate spectra were processed similarly,
normalized, and averaged to create a consensus spectral vector. The
TAG fingerprint dataset was processed with a laboratory-built MATLAB
code to create data files required for data visualization using Cytoscape
(3.7.0). The code is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ftH4u8x3d6f54nXyTr13mNk4FQp8lvp_?usp=sharing.
