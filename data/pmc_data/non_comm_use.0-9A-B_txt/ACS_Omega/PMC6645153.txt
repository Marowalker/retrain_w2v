Novel luminescent–magnetic
cellulose microfibers were prepared
by a dry–wet spinning method with the use of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide. The synthesized luminescent–magnetic
core/shell type nanostructures, based on the lanthanide-doped fluorides
and magnetite nanoparticles (NPs)—Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/PAA/LnF3, were used as
nanomodifiers of the fibers. Thanks to the successful incorporation
of the bifunctional nanomodifiers into the cellulose structure, the
functionalized fibers exhibited superior properties, that is, bright
multicolor emission under UV light and strong magnetic response. By
the use of the as-prepared fibers, the luminescent–magnetic
thread was fabricated and used to sew and make a unique pattern in
the glove material, as a proof of concept for advanced, multimodal
cloths’/materials’ protection against counterfeiting.
The presence and uniform distribution of the modifier NPs in the polymer
matrix were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The concentration of the
modifier NPs in the fibers was determined by inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry, EDX, and magnetic measurements. The luminescence
characteristics of the materials were examined by photoluminescence
spectroscopy, and their magnetic field-responsive behavior was investigated
by a superconducting quantum interference device.

1 Introduction
Cellulose
is the most widespread biopolymer on earth and is recognized
as an easily accessible and environmental-friendly raw material.1,2 Therefore, it is used in many industries, ranging from grocery,
paper, textiles, and cosmetics, to more sophisticated applications
such as modern composite materials,3−5 biodegradable wound dressings,6−10 alternative energy sources,11,12 or in optoelectronics.13,14 Recently, much attention has been paid to cellulose-based composites,
for example, cellulose fibers for special purposes. So far, with the
use of special modifiers or fillers, the fibers with antibacterial,15−18 magnetic,18−23 catalytic,24,25 thermochromic,26 conductive,27,28 or photoluminescence properties18,29−35 have been obtained. The combination of fiber properties with two
or more functionalities of active nanomaterials would open the door
to many new applications.

Materials at the nanometer scale show
different characteristics
from their bulk counterparts.36,37 This is due to the
high specific surface area of the nanomaterials (due to the increased
ratio of ions/atoms located on and near the surface to the ones within
the particle), leading to an increased number of defects, unsaturated
coordination sites, and crystal lattice strains.37,38 This is the reason why they change their physicochemical properties
(e.g., spectroscopic, thermal, mechanical, magnetic, etc.).

Characteristic features of lanthanides are long (in the range of
a few microseconds to milliseconds) luminescence lifetimes, photostability,
and narrow bands of absorption and emission.29−31,39−45 Depending on the dopant ions, an intense and multicolor (e.g., Tb3+—green, Eu3+—red) luminescence is
provided.30,46,47 Magnetite
used as a magnetic core is the strongest magnet among ferrites and
it can be easily obtained in the nanoscale.48−50 Furthermore,
its structure is well known51 and it is
biocompatible.52−54 Thanks to the combination of two or more functionalities
in a single nanomaterial, core/shell-type nanostructures may offer
superior properties in comparison to the simple materials, for example,
simultaneous luminescent–magnetic or luminescent–plasmonic
activity.39,55−57 Because of the presence
of an external shell, they can exhibit improved core stability, increased
biocompatibility, higher resistance to aggressive agents, and so forth.39,58

In this paper, we report a preparation method and photophysical
studies of the luminescent–magnetic cellulose fibers modified
with core/shell-type nanoparticles (NPs), based on the lanthanide-doped
fluorides (Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/PAA/LnF3). This kind of fibers can be produced by the
dry–wet spinning method with the use of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) as a direct solvent of cellulose.59 It is one of the most promising methods for
producing modified fibers, because a nanomodifier can be easily introduced
into the spinning dope during the dissolution of cellulose in NMMO.
Moreover, NMMO is almost completely recoverable (up to 99.6–99.7%
recovery60) and this method is environmentally
friendly.61−64 It is worth noting that such a nanomodifier must meet certain requirements;
for example, it should be stable in a highly alkaline environment,
resistant to high temperatures (≈120 °C), be inert to
NMMO, and be insoluble in water.30 We successfully
synthesized the optimized nanomodifiers, which fulfill these criteria.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that luminescent–magnetic
cellulose fibers were prepared. The novelty in the research is focused
on the preparation of bifunctional fibers, using only a single, core/shell-type
nanomodifier in the form of a stable colloid, which ensured homogenous
dispersion of the modifier NPs in the fiber matrix. Because of this
fact, fibers revealing uniform luminescence and magnetism, with good
mechanical properties, have been obtained. These fibers could be further
processed into a thread, which can be used to protect textiles.

An inspiration of the present research was a growing demand for
document and clothing security systems against counterfeiting. These
fibers could be an excellent solution to prevent fake documents and
textiles.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure
and Morphology
Figure 1a,b shows the recorded
powder diffractograms of the prepared materials. For the readers’
convenience, the abbreviations Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ and Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+ were
used for Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/PAA/CeF3:5% Tb3+ and Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/PAA/LaF3:10% Ce3+, 30% Gd3+, 1% Eu3+, respectively. Both
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the obtained luminescent–magnetic
fibers reveal reflexes corresponding to two crystalline phases, which
fit well with the reference patterns of Fe3O4 (cubic Fd3̅m), CeF3 (hexagonal P6322), or LaF3 (hexagonal P63/mmc)
from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. However, because of
the low content of NP modifiers in the fibers (≈5 wt %), the
reflexes from Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ and Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+ were hardly observed. Cellulose
I has the following diffraction peaks: (hkl 110)
at 2θ ≈ 14.7° and (hkl 002) at
2θ ≈ 22.5° and cellulose II has the following peaks:
(hkl 110) at 2θ ≈ 12.3°, (hkl 1–10) at 2θ ≈ 20.1°, and (hkl 020) 2θ ≈ 21.9°,29 which are clearly observed in the diffractograms of the
synthesized modified fibers. The reflexes’ broadening is caused
by nanocrystallinity of the synthesized materials.

Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2 (d), Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ (e), and Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+ (f); photographs of Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ (g,h) and Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+ (i,j), taken
before (g,i) and after (h,j) magnet capture, under UV light (λex = 254 nm).

Figure 1c–f
shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the synthesized
nanomodifiers (for the overview of TEM images, see Figure S1): Fe3O4 (c), Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2 (d), Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/PAA/LnF3:Tb3+ (e), and Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/PAA/LnF3:Eu3+ (f). The size of the
synthesized magnetite NPs (c) is in the range of 4–13 nm. The
surface of Fe3O4 is coated with a silica shell
modified with amine groups, which cause formation of agglomerated
core/shell-type nanostructures—Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2 (d). Core/shell NPs are covered with lanthanide
fluoride NPs, which led to the larger nanostructures, Fe3O4/SiO2/NH2/PAA/LnF3.
The morphology of the modifier is a very important factor for further
modifications of cellulose fibers. Because of the fact that the modifier
NPs form agglomerates with a size not exceeding 100–150 nm,
a homogenous distribution of the NPs inside the fibers matrix is ensured.
Thus, the mechanical properties of the modified fibers are good enough
to be further processed into thread or fabrics.

Figure 1g–j
shows the colloid of the luminescent–magnetic modifier under
UV light, before (g,i) and after (h,j) magnet capture. The modifier
NPs under UV light reveal bright, multicolor luminescence (for the
photographs taken in daylight see Figure S2). Thanks to the good magnetic–luminescence properties of
the modifier NPs, even their small addition provides fibers with superior
properties.

2.2 Concentration of a Modifier
in the Fibers
To estimate the real content of the modifier
in the fiber matrix,
the fibers were examined by means of inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP–MS) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis
(EDX). On the basis of the known composition of the modifiers, the
contents of the modifiers in the fibers were calculated as 4.6 (ICP)
and 5.1 wt % (EDX) for Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+, and 5.4 (ICP) and 6.0 wt % (EDX)
for Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+. The calculated results are shown in Table S1. To additionally confirm these results, the concentration
of the modifier (Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+) in the fibers was approximated (see Figure S3) by means of magnetic measurements.
The modifier concentration was determined as 5.43%. The results are
consistent with the quantities used for modification (≈5 wt
%). Differences between the theoretical and determined content of
the modifier may result from the incomplete incorporation of the modifier
in the fiber structure or incomplete dissolution of the cellulose
used to prepare the spinning dope.

2.3 SEM–EDX
Analysis
Figure 2 shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the overview (a1,b1), surface
(a2,b2), and cross section (a3,b3) of the modified cellulose fibers
(with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+—images a1–a3, with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+—b1–b3).
In the images presented, the modifier NPs (white spots) are uniformly
distributed on the surface and in the volume of the fiber. The fiber
diameter is in the range of 25–30 μm. The SEM–EDX
mapping presented in Figure 3 confirms a homogenous dispersion of the modifier NPs in the
polymer matrix.

Figure 2 SEM images—overview (a1,b1), surface (a2,b2), and
cross
section (a3,b3) of the cellulose fibers modified with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+ (a1–a3)
and Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ (b1–b3).

as green (a2,b2); silicon—violet (a3,b3); cerium—yellow

Figure S4 (see the Supporting Information) presents the EDX analysis of fibers modified with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ and
Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+. Both spectra reveal the presence of Fe, O, Si, and lanthanides
occurring in a given nanomodifier. The most intense peaks corresponding
to C and O originate from cellulose. The aluminum signal appearing
in the EDX spectrum comes from the aluminum-holder, used to fix the
EDX samples.

2.4 Luminescence Properties
of the Modified Fibers
One of the two main goals of the present
study was to produce fibers
endowed with luminescence properties. The luminescence of the modified
cellulose fibers under UV light irradiation is presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Luminescence of the synthesized
fibers: (a,b) fibers modified with
Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+, (c,d) with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+; taken in daylight (a,c) and under ultraviolet
light irradiation, λex = 254 nm (b,d).

Figure 5a,b shows
excitation and emission spectra of Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ and fibers modified with
Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+, respectively. Excitation spectra were measured at λem = 545 nm, where the most intense emission band, resulting
from 5D4 → 7F5 transition,
was recorded. The broad band observed in the spectrum corresponds
to the f–d transition within Ce3+ ions (allowed
by selection rules), related to the excitation of Ce3+ and
the subsequent energy transfer (ET) to Tb3+ ions.65 In the emission spectrum (observed at λex = 251 nm), there are four characteristic bands associated
with transitions from the lowest excited Tb3+ level—5D4 → 7FJ (J = 6–3).66

Figure 5 Excitation
(a,c) and emission (b,d) spectra of the prepared materials:
a,b—Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ and fibers modified with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+, c,d—Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+ and fibers modified with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+.

Figure 5c,d
presents
the excitation and emission spectra of Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+ and fiber modified
with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+, respectively. The excitation spectrum (recorded at λem = 592 nm, where the most intense band in the emission spectra
originated from the 5D0 → 7F1 transition was recorded) shows a main broad band at
248 nm connected with the ET from Ce3+ to Eu3+ ions. In the emission spectra, five narrow, split bands related
to 5D1 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 1–4) transitions can be observed.

The luminescence decay curves of the synthesized materials (Figure 6) were recorded at
λex = 251 nm, λem = 545 nm (for
the Tb3+-doped compounds) and at λex =
248 nm, λem = 592 nm (for the Eu3+-doped
compounds). The recorded decay profiles were fitted well to biexponential
function I = A1 exp(−t/τ1) + A2 exp(−t/τ2), with R2 > 0.999 (I—luminescence intensity at
time t, A—amplitude, τ—luminescence
lifetime, R2—correlation coefficient).
The biexponential character of the recorded decay curves is related
to the different local coordination environments of the Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions, situated inside and on the NPs’
surface. As the synthesized modifier NPs exhibit a high surface-to-volume
ratio, the abundant surface ions, which are easily quenched by water
molecules, are responsible for the short-living component of the decay
curve (τ2). The determined luminescence lifetimes
are in the range of several milliseconds (see Table 1), which is typical of Eu3+ and
Tb3+ ions embedded in the inorganic fluoride matrices.56 The emission lifetimes of the composite materials,
that is, modified fibers, are shorter than the lifetimes of the modifier
NPs. This may be a consequence of the spinning process, as the reagents
used to obtain the spinning dope may deposit on the NPs, resulting
in luminescence quenching. The emission of the obtained cellulose
fibers is very intense, which is a crucial factor for their further
applications.

fibers with Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+	0.63 (30%)	5.85 (70%)	
2.5 Magnetic Properties
The second main
goal was to receive fibers with magnetic properties (Figure 8b,c). Figure 7a,b presents the hysteresis loops of core/shell
NPs, modifiers, and modified fibers, respectively. Magnetization as
a function of magnetic field was measured at room temperature (300.0
K) and a magnetic field up to 7.0 T, using a superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The obtained results show
that all core/shell NPs exhibit fast saturation of magnetization,
typical for a superparamagnetic material. The weak hysteresis with
a coercive field of about 0.005 T and remanence below 5% of saturation
magnetization is characteristic for a soft ferromagnetic material.
However, the zero-field-cooled/field-cooled (ZFC/FC) measurements
at 0.02 T revealed that the examined modifier NPs, and hence the fibers,
over 280.0 K show a behavior characteristic for superparamagnetic
materials (Figure 7c,d). As it is well known, magnetite particles become superparamagnetic
when they reach a size smaller than ≈12 nm. This leads to the
conclusion that the dominant superparamagnetic contribution comes
from the magnetite NPs, with an average size (see Figure S5) in this case of 8.7 nm, whereas the small ferromagnetic
signal comes from the minority of the magnetite NPs, which are larger
than 12 nm. Unmodified fibers exhibit negative magnetization as a
function of magnetic field, which means that they are diamagnetic.
The saturation magnetization of the fibers is smaller than that of
the modifier—that is because of the lower content of modifier
NPs (in 1 g of fibers, there is ≈5 wt % of the modifier).

modifiers (c) and modified fibers (d).

2.6 Mechanical Properties
The results
of the linear density and mechanical properties such as strength and
elongation at break are presented in Table 2. The linear density of the modified fibers
is significantly higher than for the unmodified ones (spun at the
same draw-ratio—10 m/min), which is caused by the presence
of the modifier NPs in the cellulose fibers. The measured mechanical
properties show that introduction of a modifier into a polymer matrix
slightly impairs the mechanical properties of the fibers. Unmodified
fibers have the highest tenacity as well as elongation at break. This
is probably due to the formation of NP agglomerates in the cellulose
matrix, which decreases the elasticity of the fibers. However, it
should be emphasized that the fibers have been obtained on a laboratory
scale and that the properties of the cellulose fibers formed by the
wet methods are highly dependent on the process conditions. The resultant
good mechanical properties can be explained by the fact that the modifier
NPs were introduced into the fibers in the form of a colloid. As a
result, a good dispersion of the modifier NPs in the cellulose matrix
(see SEM and SEM–EDX) was achieved. Thanks to this, the presence
of the modifier NPs only slightly decreases the mechanical properties
of the fibers, in contrast to the fibers in which the modifier particles
were introduced in the form of a powder.

The scheme of the formation
of the luminescent–magnetic
cellulose fibers is presented in Figure 8a. Thanks to the
mentioned good mechanical properties of the modified fibers, the luminescent–magnetic
thread has been successfully fabricated. The multifunctional thread
has been further used to sew a unique pattern in the glove material
(Figure 8d,e).

3 Conclusions
The
multifunctional, hybrid materials composed of cellulose microfibers,
modified with luminescent–magnetic core/shell nanostructures,
were successfully prepared by the NMMO method. XRD, SEM, and ICP–MS
analyses confirmed the presence and evaluated the distribution and
content of the modifier NPs in the cellulose matrices. The luminescence–magnetic
properties of the modified fibers were verified by spectroscopic and
magnetic measurements. The modified lyocell fibers presented in this
paper can be used to produce threads and yarns as well as paper. Thanks
to their good photophysical properties, these fibers can be introduced
into knitted fabric and paper in small quantities, which significantly
reduces manufacturing costs. This kind of luminescent–magnetic
fibers are excellent materials for textile and document protection,
because they are almost impossible to counterfeit, and at the same
time their authenticity can be easily proven using UV light or a magnetometer.
Under UV light irradiation, the modified hybrid fibers glow and exhibit
magnetization, which make them novel and unique, multifunctional materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
To prepare
the cellulose
solution, pulp from Rayonier [polymerization degree () 1250, 96.8 wt % of α-cellulose]
and 50% aqueous solution of NMMO (from Huntsman Holland BV, The Netherlands)
were used. In order to stabilize the molecular weight, the propyl
ester of gallic acid—Tenox PG (purchased from Aldrich, Gillingham,
Dorset, UK) as an antioxidant was applied. The modifiers of the cellulose
fibers were the core/shell-type NPs: Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Tb3+ and Fe3O4/SiO2/LnF3:Eu3+, synthesized according
to the protocol reported by Runowski and Lis39 (synthesis details can be found in the Supporting Information).

4.2 Instrumentations
The cellulose solution
was made in a high-efficiency laboratory-scale IKAVISC kneader type
MKD 0.6-H60. The fibers were spun with the use of the dry–wet
spinning method on a laboratory-scale piston-spinning device with
a spinneret equipped with 18 orifices of 0.4 mm diameter. TEM images
were obtained using a Hitachi HT7700 microscope, operating at 100
kV, in order to determine the size and shape distribution of the modifier
particles. The XRD patterns were measured with a Bruker AXS D8 Advance
diffractometer (6°–60° 2θ range) using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The concentration of
the modifier NPs introduced into the fiber structure was determined
with a Shimadzu ICPMS-2030 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.
To confirm the presence and evaluate the distribution of the modifier
NPs, the EDX, SEM, and SEM–EDX images were obtained with a
scanning electron microscope FEI Quanta 250 FEG, using an EDAX detector.
The excitation and emission spectra as well as luminescence decay
curves were recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer. The
spectra were corrected for the instrumental response. To study the
magnetic properties of modified fibers, a SQUID MPMS-7 XL Quantum
Design was used. The mechanical properties of the fibers were measured
using a Zwick Z2.5/TN1S tensile testing machine, according to the
Polish norm PN-85/P-04761/04. The fibers’ linear density was
measured in accordance with the Polish norm PN-72/P-04800.

4.3 Preparation of the Spinning Dope
In order to prepare
the spinning dope, an appropriate amount of cellulose
pulp, an aqueous solution of NMMO, Tenox PG, and the modifier were
placed into the kneader equipped with an efficient stirring system
and heating. The modifier in the form of an aqueous colloidal solution
was added in such a quantity as to reach about 5 wt % of each modifier
in dry cellulose fibers. Subsequently, cellulose was dissolved under
low pressure (≈20 hPa) at a temperature not exceeding 115 °C.
During the process, water was removed until its contents in cellulose
did not exceed 14 wt %. The dissolution of cellulose lasted about
1.5 h. The resulting thick, transparent, amber-like colored spinning
dope was obtained.

4.4 Preparation of Cellulose
Fibers
The
spinning dope was placed into a preheated cylinder, with the temperature
not exceeding 115 °C (to avoid decomposition of NMMO). Then,
the melted solution was pressed through the nozzle holes, and through
the air gap it was immersed in an aqueous solidifying bath at 20 °C.
The fibers were spun at a take-up speed 10 m/min, washed, and dried
at room temperature.
