The development of sustainable protocols
for enhancing the production
of ethanol is highly important for its utilization in automotive transportation
and energy sector. Up to 15% ethanol can blend with diesel to make
e-diesel that can be used in fuel compression ignition engine. Urea-modified
amino acids can be used as a very good vitalizer for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Baker’s yeast (ATCC
204508)) growth and thus promote ethanol production. A simple, one-step,
room-temperature synthetic procedure has been developed for urea-appended
α-amino acids from amino acid by treatment with KCNO. Single-crystal
X-ray studies confirm the successful synthesis and molecular structures
of the urea-appended α-amino acids. Out of 20 urea-appended
amino acids, Arg-, Pro-, His-, and Gln-containing compounds promote
yeast growth significantly after 12 h at pH 6.8 and 38 °C. These
compounds are nontoxic. The urea-appended Arg shows 2-fold increase
of yeast growth. However, urea-appended m-aminobenzoic
acid and p-aminobenzoic acid inhibit yeast growth.
NMR experiments confirmed the enhanced production of ethanol by glucose
fermentation in the presence of 2.5 μmol urea-appended Arg.
Not only glucose but also commercially available sugars and feedstock
of the starch slurry drained out after boiling of rice exhibit significant
enhancement of ethanol production under same conditions.

Introduction
With rapidly growing
urbanization and enhancement in living standards,
a rapid growth in energy and fuel consumption has been observed in
the last century.1 The demand of energy
for transportation, heating, and industrial processing is increasing
dramatically.2 But the reserve of fossil
fuels is limited, and the use of fossil fuel is not environment-friendly.
In this critical situation, conversion of biomass into fuel is highly
important.3−7 Biomass has long been used widely to extract valuable products such
as medicine, flavors, and fragrances.8 It
is a renewable, cheap, and highly available natural resource, which
is generally employed for the production of biodiesel and other commodity
chemicals.9,10 Arguably, ethanol is one of the environment-friendly
bioenergy sources with high efficiency.11 The annual production of ethanol is approximately 51 000
million liters worldwide,12 of which fuel
encompasses 73% of ethanol obtained, industry uses 10%, and beverages
consume 17%.12 However, over 98% of bioethanol
is made from corn.13 As a result, the competition
between fuel and food increases. Hence, the production of biodiesel
from nonedible biomass or kitchen waste is highly important. Woodson
and Jablonowskiy reported that “as an additive (ethanol), serves
as a fuel volume extender, an oxygenate and an octane enhancer”.14 According to Sánchez and Cardona, most
of the countries in the world use ethanol-mixed gasoline or directly
ethanol as fuel.15 Generally, ethanol is
a product of microbe-assisted fermentation. Microorganisms meet their
energy demand by converting carbon-containing compounds into carbon
dioxide, lactic acid, and ethanol.16 Fermentation
of carbohydrates into alcohol is one of the most effective and cheapest
methods to produce ethanol with negligible environmental pollution.
But due to the complex structure and very high stability, complex
carbohydrates can hardly be degraded by most of the microorganisms
under normal fermentation. Therefore, to enhance efficiency, pretreatment
is necessary. Various pretreatment methods, including diluted acid
pretreatment, liquid hot water pretreatment, steam explosion, wet
oxidation, and biological treatment, have been reported.17−20 But pretreatments are costly and cause serious environmental concerns.21

In this context, we have adopted a sustainable
method to vitalize
yeast growth and promote carbohydrates/biomass fermentation. The objective
was not to prepare isolated, pure chemicals like petrochemical industries
or traditional organic synthesis. In general, we are interested in
degradation and conversion of biomass/carbohydrates through fermentation
to obtain ethanol. We are developing designer amino acids and analogues.22−24 Herein, we have designed and synthesized a series of urea-appended
α-amino acids. Although the urea-appended m-aminobenzoic acid and p-aminobenzoic acid have
been investigated in materials science,25 very little is known about the structure and function of the urea-appended
α-amino acids. The natural abundance and excellent biological
importance of urea and α-amino acids motivated us to examine
the conformational preferences and properties of these hybrid compounds
(Figure 1).26 Urea is a popular fertilizer as a source of
nitrogen and is an important raw material for the chemical and cosmetic
industry.27 Also, urea serves a crucial
role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds. On the other
hand, amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and enzymes.
Due to their biological importance, amino acids are used in nutritional
supplements and for the development of drugs, biodegradable polymers,
and so on. So, the fusion of urea and amino acids will be fascinating
(Figure 1). Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the successful synthesis and molecular
conformations of the urea-appended α-amino acids. Out of 20
urea-appended amino acids, Arg-, Pro-, His-, and Gln-containing compounds
promote yeast growth significantly after 12 h at pH 6.8 and 38 °C.
The urea-appended amino acids are nontoxic. The Arg-containing compound 2 shows twofold increase of yeast growth. However, urea-appended m-aminobenzoic acid and p-aminobenzoic
acid inhibit yeast growth drastically. NMR experiments and kinetics
studies confirmed the enhanced production of ethyl alcohol (EtOH)
by glucose fermentation in the presence of 2.5 μmol compound 2 at 38 °C and pH 6.8. Not only glucose but also commercially
available sugar and kitchen waste exhibit significant conversion to
ethanol under the same condition.

this study.

Results and Discussion
Urea-appended
amino acids were synthesized by the reaction between
KCNO and the corresponding amino acid in water at 25 °C for 4
h, followed by acidification with hydrochloric acid to pH 2–3
(Figure 1b).28 The obtained white precipitate was collected
by filtration. The synthesized compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry techniques.
The Leu- and Arg-containing urea-appended amino acids were analyzed
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. From growth inhibition
zone studies of Escherichia coli bacteria
and the mammalian cell uptake experiments, the compounds are nontoxic
(Supporting information Figures S83 and S84). Colorless orthorhombic crystals of Leu -containing compound 1 were obtained from dimethyl sulfoxide–tetrahydrofuran
(DMSO-THF) solution by slow evaporation. There is one molecule of
compound 1 in the asymmetric unit (Figure 2a). The packing diagram shows that each compound 1 molecule self-assembles with six molecules through N–H···O
and O–H···O hydrogen bonds and thus forms a
hexagonal honeycomb-like structure along crystallographic a and b directions (Figure 2b). The hydrogen-bonding parameters are listed
in Supporting Information Table S1.

Figure 2 (a) Solid-state
conformation of compound 1. (b) Intermolecular
hydrogen-bonded hexagonal honeycomb-like structure of compound 1 along crystallographic a and b directions. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dotted lines.

Colorless monoclinic crystals of Arg-containing compound 2 were obtained from water solution by slow evaporation. There
is one molecule of compound 2 along with one molecule
of water in the asymmetric unit (Figure 3a). In higher-order packing, compound 2 forms a cagelike structure with eight more molecules and
waters through multiple intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions. Table S2 in the Supporting Information shows
the hydrogen-bonding parameters of compound 2. So, compound 2 has many active sites to recognize and interact with other
molecules.

acid 2 with one molecule of water in the asymmetric unit.

We have adopted a method to enhance carbohydrates/biomass
conversion
using urea-appended amino acids. The objective was not to prepare
isolated, pure chemicals that could be obtained from petrochemical
industries or traditional synthesis. Rather we are interested in the
degradation and conversion of biomass/carbohydrates through fermentation
to obtain valuable functional end-products such as ethanol. Currently,
ethanol is the most widely used biofuel in combination with diesel.
Our approach will dramatically decrease the biomass processing time
and cost, which is a major concern in this industry.29,30 For that purpose, we have used Lysogeny broth (LB) containing 2%
dextrose as a medium. Although yeast nitrogen base (YNB) is a highly
referenced growth medium for yeast cultivation, it contains amino
acids, nitrogen, vitamins, trace elements, and salts. But we want
to measure the effect of urea-appended amino acid on yeast growth.
So we have opted Lysogeny broth (LB) medium, which contains less amount
of yeast growth nutrient and no amino acid. The medium (10 mL) was
taken in a test tube and 2 mg of urea-appended amino acid was added.
To this solution, 10 μL of yeast culture was added and incubated
for 12 h at 35 °C. For control, we have used only urea and yeast
following the same procedure and under the same condition. After 12
h, the absorption spectra were recorded. The absorbance at 600 nm
was plotted (Figure 4a). From Figure 4a,
we conclude that out of 20 urea-appended amino acids, Arg-, His-,
Gln-, and Pro-containing urea-appended amino acids promote the growth
of yeast, whereas urea-appended m-aminobenzoic acid
(m-ABA) and p-aminobenzoic acid
(p-ABA) inhibited the growth of yeast. Only urea
has almost no effect on the growth of yeast. The Arg-containing urea-appended
amino acid 2 exhibits maximum enhancement of yeast growth.
For further clarification, we carried out the control experiments
for Arg-, His-, Gln-, and Pro-containing urea-appended amino acids.
LB medium (10 mL) containing 2% dextrose was taken in each test tube.
Arg/His/Gln/Pro-containing urea-appended amino acid, only urea, only
amino acid, or urea and amino acid mixture (2 mg) was added. To that
solution, 10 μL of yeast culture was added and incubated for
50 h at 40 °C. The absorbances at 600 nm were noted in a regular
time interval. Figure 4b shows the control yeast growth for Arg-containing urea-appended
amino acid 2. From Figure 4b, only urea, only Arg, or urea and Arg mixture has
no effect on the growth of yeast. But Arg-containing urea-appended
amino acid 2 increased the rate of yeast growth within
20 h. Similarly, Figure 4c shows the control yeast growth for Pro-containing urea-appended
amino acid, which increased the rate of yeast growth within 30 h.
However, from Figure 4d, only urea, only Gln, or urea and Gln mixture have almost no effect
on the growth of yeast. But Gln-containing urea-appended amino acid
has increased the rate of yeast growth within 20 h (Figure 4d). Figure 4e shows that the His-containing urea-appended
amino acid has increased the growth rate of yeast within 20 h.

Figure 4 (a) Response
of 20 urea-modified amino acids toward yeast growth.
Only Arg-, His-, Gln-, and Pro-containing urea-modified amino acids
are promoting the growth of yeast. The m-ABA- and p-ABA-containing urea-modified amino acids inhibited the
growth of yeast. (b) Control yeast growth for Arg-containing urea-modified
amino acid. (c) Control yeast growth for Pro-containing urea-modified

amino acid.

Figure 5a shows
the pH optimization for Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2 after 12 h. LB medium (10 mL) containing 2% dextrose was
taken in test tubes, and 2 mg of Arg-containing urea-appended amino
acid 2 and 10 μL of yeast culture were added in
respective test tubes. The pH of the test varies from 3 to 11. The
solutions were incubated for 12 h at 35 °C and studied by absorption
spectroscopy. From Figure 5a, we conclude that the growth of yeast in the presence of
Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2 is maximum
at pH 6.8. We have also done temperature optimization for Arg-containing
urea-appended amino acid 2. LB medium (10 mL) containing
2% dextrose was taken in each test tube, and 2 mg of Arg-containing
urea-appended amino acid 2 and 10 μL of yeast culture
were added at pH 6.8. The test tubes were incubated for 12 h at a
different temperature ranging from 30 to 55 °C, and the absorbance
was examined at 600 nm after 12 h. From Figure 5b, yeast growth in the presence of Arg-containing
urea-appended amino acid 2 is maximum at 38 °C.
Further, we have performed the concentration optimization for Arg/His/Gln/Pro-containing
urea-appended amino acid after 12 h. The LB medium containing 2% dextrose
was taken in a 96-well plate. Urea-appended Arg/His/Gln/Pro was taken
at various concentrations (making concentration gradient: 0.1–50
μmol), and 10 μL of yeast culture was added. The solution
was incubated for 50 h at 38 °C and pH 6.8 and studied by absorption
spectroscopy (Figure 5c). From Figure 5c,
we conclude that the optimized concentration for Arg-containing urea-appended
amino acids is 2.5 μmol, 16 μmol for His-containing urea-appended
amino acids, 9.5 μmol for Gln-containing urea- modified amino
acids, and 25 μmol for Pro-containing urea-appended amino acids.
Then, we have studied the effect of Arg/His/Gln/Pro-containing urea-appended
amino acid on yeast growth at pH 6.8 and temperature 38 °C. LB
medium (10 mL) containing 2% dextrose was taken in test tubes and
urea-appended Arg (2.5 μmol), His (16 μmol), Gln (9.5
μmol), and Pro (25 μmol) were added respectively. Yeast
culture (10 μL) was added in each tube, the test tubes were
incubated for 50 h at 38 °C and pH 6.8, and absorbance was examined
at 600 nm in regular intervals. From Figure 5d, we conclude that for each case, yeast
growth promoted for the respective urea-appended amino acid at respective
optimized concentration. We also calculate the approximate growth
rate as shown in Figure 5e. Moreover, we have studied the yeast growth for second cycle after
reaching first time saturation at pH 6.8 and 38 °C in the presence
of 2.5 μmol Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2. LB medium (10 mL) containing 2% dextrose was taken in the test
tubes and 2.5 μmol Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2 and 10 μL of yeast culture were added. The test tubes
were incubated at 38 °C and pH 6.8 for 50 h. The absorbance at
600 nm was recorded after 50 h. After that, the respective absorbance
becomes saturated and we consider this absorbance as the absorbance
data for 0 h for the second time addition of 2% dextrose (second cycle).
Again the test tubes were incubated at 38 °C and pH 6.8 for 50
h and the absorbance at 600 nm was noted regularly. From Figure 5f, we conclude that
the Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2 can facilitate
yeast growth for the second cycle.

acids after 24/48 h cell culture with several serial dilutions of

To study the kinetics of glucose fermentation by yeast and ethanol
production, NMR experiments were performed. LB medium (50 mL) containing
2% dextrose was taken in a 100 mL sealed conical flask. Arg-containing
urea-appended amino acid 2 (2.5 μmol) and 10 μL
of yeast culture were added. The solution was incubated at 38 °C
and pH 6.8. 1H NMR spectra were recorded in 5 h interval.
From the 1H NMR stack plot (Figure 7a), we conclude that in the presence of Arg-containing
urea-appended amino acid 2, the yeast fermented the dextrose
(glucose) with consecutive generation of ethanol and the amount of
ethanol increases with increasing time. The same procedure was followed
for the control (without urea-appended amino acid). Figure 7b shows simultaneously the
degradation (fermentation) of dextrose and the formation (generation)
of ethanol. Figure 7b exhibits the higher rate of degradation of glucose by yeast in
the presence of Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2 and the rate of formation of ethanol. We have also performed the
catalytic cycle experiments. Interestingly, Figure 7c depicts that the degradation of glucose
by yeast in the presence of Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2 works nicely up to three cycles.

yeast in the presence of Arg-containing urea-modified amino acid 2 and ethanol production. (b) Yield calculation for glucose
fermentation and ethanol production. (c) Catalytic cycles.

We have also examined the degradation of other carbohydrates.
For
that, 10 mL of LB medium containing 2% commercially available sugar
was taken in the test tubes, and 10 μL of yeast culture was
added. Arg/His/Gln/Pro-containing urea-appended amino acids were taken
respectively in test tubes and incubated at 38 °C and pH 6.8
for 12 h. The absorbance at 600 nm was recorded for different carbohydrates.

We have also examined the EtOH formation for feedstock of the starch
slurry drained out after boiling of rice through 1H NMR
(Figure 8). For that
purpose, 10 mL of LB medium containing 2% starch slurry was taken
in test tubes and 10 μL of yeast culture was added. Arg-containing
urea-appended amino acid was taken respectively in test tubes and
incubated at 38 °C and pH 6.8 for 12 h. NMR spectra were measured
with respect to time. Figure 8 exhibits higher rate of formation of EtOH by yeast in the
presence of Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
designed and synthesized urea-appended α-amino
acids. We have also discussed their effect on vitalization of yeast
and enhancement of fermentation and ethanol production. In solid state,
Leu-containing urea-appended amino acid 1 forms a hydrogen-bonded
honeycomb-like structure. But Arg-containing urea-appended amino acid 2 forms water-mediated cagelike structure through multiple
intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions. From the urea-appended
amino acids library, Arg-, Pro-, His-, and Gln-containing compounds
vitalize yeast significantly after 12 h at pH 6.8 and 38 °C.
The compounds are nontoxic. The Arg-containing compound 2 exhibits twofold increase of yeast growth. The NMR studies exhibit
the enhanced production of ethanol due to fermentation of glucose
in the presence of 2.5 μmol compound 2 at 38 °C
and pH 6.8. Moreover, commercially available sugar and kitchen waste
like feedstock of starch slurry drained out after boiling of rice
exhibit significant enhancement of ethanol production under same conditions.
These developments pointed to a sustainable way for fuels and commodity
chemical industries.

NMR Experiments
All NMR spectroscopy experiments were
done on a 400 MHz JEOL spectrometer. Compound concentrations were
in the 1–10 mM range in DMSO-d6.

FTIR Experiments
FTIR spectroscopy experiments in solid
state were performed with a PerkinElmer Spectrum RX1 spectrophotometer
using the KBr disk method.

Absorption Spectroscopy
The absorption
spectra of peptides
were measured on a PerkinElmer UV/Vis spectrometer (Lambda 35) using
quartz cell having 1 cm path length.

Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry was carried out
on a Waters Corporation Q-Tof Micro YA263 high-resolution mass spectrometer
by electrospray ionization (positive-mode).

X-ray Crystallography
Intensity data for compounds 1 and 2 were
recorded on a Bruker high-resolution
X-ray diffractometer instrument. The structures were solved by a direct
method and refined by least-squares calculations on F2 for all independent
reflections (SHELXL-2014).32 Refinement
of nonhydrogen atoms was performed using anisotropic thermal parameters.

Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre with CCDC reference 1871263 and 1886141,
respectively.

Culture Preparations
We took 2.5
g of LB medium (casein
enzymic hydrolysate, 10 g L–1; yeast extract, 2
g L–1; sodium chloride, 10 g L–1) and 2 g of dextrose in 100 mL of H2O and autoclaved
it for 20 min in 15 lbs, 121 °C, 38 °C, 225 rpm, pH = 6.8.

EtOH Measuring Methods
