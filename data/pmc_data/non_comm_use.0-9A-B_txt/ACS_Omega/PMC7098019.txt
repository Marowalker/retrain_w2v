Certain
pyridothienopyrimidine
derivatives
exhibit antiatheroscleorotic, antibacterial, antiviral, antidepressant,
antidiabetic, antihypertensive, anticancer, antihistaminic, antiallergic,
anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, analgesic, and neurotropic activities.
4-Hydrazino-7,9-dimethylpyrido[3′,2′:4,5]thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (1) is a reported pyridothienopyrimidine
derivative. In the current study, (1) has been reacted
with different reagents to obtain 12 new pyridothienopyrimidine derivatives.
The newly synthesized five-membered heterocyclic rings incorporated
with pyridothienopyrimidines have been screened for their antibacterial
activities. The results encourage further studies on other possible
biological activities.

Introduction
As an example of a
triheterocyclic
system, pyridothienopyrimidine has interesting biological activities
among its derivatives which have attracted much attention. Pyridothienopyrimidines
are a special class of thienopyridine derivatives. There are two regioisomeric
structures, namely, 5H-thieno[2,3,4-e,d]pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine (Figure 1A) or pyrido[3′,2′:4,5]
thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (Figure 1B). These two structures give all pyridothienopyrimidine
derivatives which are prepared by annulation of thieno[2,3-b] pyridines.1

Figure 1 Chemical structures
of 5H-thieno[2,3,4-e,d]pyrido[4,3-d]pyrmidine (A) and pyrido[3′,2′:4,5]
thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (B).

Among all
fused thienoazines, pyridothienopyrimidine derivatives have been studied
the most. These derivatives act as bactericides2−6 fungicides,2−6 antiprotozoals,7 or immunomodulators;
exhibit antianaphylactic,
antiallergic,8 anticonvulsive,9 analgetic, or anti-inflammatory activities;10,11 and are used as intermediate products in chemical pharmaceutical
industry.1

In addition to antimicrobial,2−6 anticonvulsant,9 and anticancer activities12−17 of pyridothienopyrimidine derivatives, recent
studies showed that they have the ability to specifically activate
testicular steroidogenesis without affecting thyroid functions.18 They also have inhibitory
effects on some closely linked factors to human malignancies such
as cellular mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor;19 the Moloney murine leukemia virus-1 (pim-1)20 proviral integration site; some signaling pathways
that play an important role in tumorigenesis;21 VEGFR-2 receptors to reduce angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis;22 and act as alpha-1 blockers23 that are mainly used as a prescribed drugs for benign prostatic
hyperplasia, manage hypertension, and treatment of posttraumatic stress
disorder.

Within this respect, the current study has aimed to
examine the chemistry of 4-hydrazino-7,9-dimethylpyrido[3′,2′:4,5]thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine24 to be used as
a starting material for the synthesis of some new pyrazole, pyrazolopyrimidine,
and thiazole derivatives and investigate their antibacterial activities.

Results
and Discussion
Ethoxymethylene

Materials and
Methods
Synthetic Methods, Analytical and Spectral Data
A Büchi
melting point apparatus was used to measure the newly synthesized
pyridothienopyrimidine derivatives’ melting points, which were
uncorrected. A Bruker-Vector22 spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany)
was used to record IR spectra (KBr). A Varian Gemini spectrometer
(300 MHz, DMSO-d6) was used to record 1H NMR with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference.
The chemical shifts are expressed in δ scale (ppm) relative
to TMS as a reference, and the coupling constants (J values) are given in hertz (Hz). Analytical thin layer chromatography
was performed to monitor the progress of the reactions using aluminum
silica gel 60 F245 plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Antimicrobial
activities were screened at the College of Medicine, Dar Al Uloom
University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Antimicrobial
Screening
Preparation of the Sample
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
(12.5%) solvent was used to dissolve
each of the test compounds and standards at 500 μg/mL concentration.
Further diluted compounds and standards were prepared at the required
quantities in the test medium.

Microorganisms’
Culture
Reference cultures of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC-6633) (Gram-positive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853) (Gram-negative), and Streptomyces species (actinomycetes) were supplied from the Microbiology Department,
College of Medicine, Dar Al Uloom University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia as the bacterial strains for determining antibacterial activities
of the newly synthesized pyridothienopyrimidine derivatives. A Mueller–Hinton
agar (MHA) medium (Oxoid Chemical Co., UK) was used to maintain the
bacterial strains for 24 h at 37 °C. A formed layer of about
3–4 mm thickness was obtained by melting the medium on a water
bath, inoculating with 0.5 mL of the culture of the specific microorganism
and poured into sterile Petri dishes. The layer was allowed to cool
and harden. With the aid of a cork-borer, cups of about 10 mm diameter
were produced.25

Agar Diffusion Technique
Newly synthesized pyridothienopyrimidine
derivatives were screened for their antibacterial activities against B. subtilis (Gram-positive), P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative), and Streptomyces species (actinomycetes) using MHA medium (17.5 g casein hydrolysate,
1.5 g soluble starch, and 1000 mL beef extract). A stock solution
of each synthesized compound (500 μg/mL) in DMSO was prepared,
and graded quantities of the test compounds were incorporated in the
specified quantity of sterilized liquid MHA medium. Different concentrations
of pyridothienopyrimidine derivatives in dimethylformamide were placed
separately in cups in the agar medium. Overnight incubation was applied
for all plates at 37 °C. The measurement of inhibition zones
was performed after 24 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
was defined as the intercept of the grave of logarithm concentrations
versus diameter of the inhibition zones.26,27

The antibacterial activities of the newly synthesized pyridothienopyrimidine
derivatives have been screened against three microorganisms; B. subtilis (ATCC-6633) (Gram-positive), P. aeruginosa (ATCC-27853) (Gram-negative), and Streptomyces species (actinomycetes) (Table 2).

The results of the
antibacterial activities screening have shown that compounds 6, 7, 8, and 11 have
the highest activity against B. subtilis with MIC values of 75 μg/mL followed by compounds 2, 3, and 4. Compound 5 has
the highest inhibition power against P. aeruginosa. Among the series of screened derivatives, compounds 4, 5, 7, and 8 are the most
active against Streptomyces species
with MIC values of 75 μg/mL. In addition, there are compounds
that have shown limited biological activities and others that have
not had any antibacterial activity. The MIC values of all screened
compounds are shown in Table 2.
