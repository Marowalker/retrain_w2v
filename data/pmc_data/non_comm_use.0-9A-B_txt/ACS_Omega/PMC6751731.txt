Capric acid (CA)
is one of the most promising phase change materials
to be used in reducing the energy consumption of buildings due to
its suitable phase change temperature and high latent heat. In this
paper, a novel shape-stabilized phase change material (SSPCM) is fabricated
by “hazardous waste” fly ash (FA) via simple impregnation
method along with CA and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In this composite,
raw FA without any modification serves as the carrier matrix to improve
structural strength and overcome the drawback of the leakage of liquid
CA. Simultaneously, CNTs act as an additive to increase the thermal
conductivity of composites. The results of leakage tests indicate
that CA was successfully confined as 20 wt % in the composite. Then,
various characterization techniques were adopted to investigate the
structure and properties of the prepared SSPCM of CA/FA/CNT. Scanning
electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results
showed that CA was well adsorbed into the microstructure of FA, and
there was no chemical interaction between the components of the composites.
Thermogravimetric analysis results demonstrated that the SSPCM presented
good thermal stability. Differential scanning calorimetry results
indicated that the melting temperature and freezing temperature of
CA/FA/CNT were 31.08 and 27.88 °C, respectively, and the latent
heats of CA/FA/CNT during the melting and freezing processes were
20.54 and 20.19 J g–1, respectively. Moreover, compared
to the CA and CA/FA, the heat transfer efficiency of CA/FA/CNT was
significantly improved by doping 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt % of CNT. All of
the results suggest that CA/FA/CNT possessed comfortable melting and
freezing temperatures, excellent thermal stability, high latent heat
value, and favorable thermal conductivity, and therefore, it is a
suitable thermal storage material for building applications. Simultaneously,
CA/FA/CNT can improve the comprehensive utilization level of FA.

1 Introduction
In recent years, with
rapidly increasing and huge energy demand
such as energy consumption of buildings,1,2 improper utilization
of fossil energy such as oil and coal inevitably results in serious
environmental pollution. Taking the unclean use of coal as an example,
combustion as the main utilization of coal brings about a large amount
of solid waste—fly ash (FA). Particularly, in thermal power
plants, during the coal-fired power generation process, a large amount
of fly ash is generated. Therefore, conserving energy and developing
new energy are imperative to protect the environment. However, the
problems of low efficiency and poor supply stability seriously restrict
the large-scale application of renewable energy. Fortunately, thermal
energy storage is an effective solution for the utilization efficiency
and stability of renewable energy sources. Therefore, thermal storage
technologies have been developed to overcome this issue. Compared
to other types, latent heat storage, which can store or release energy
during the phase change process, is considered to be a promising type
of heat storage.2 In the investigated thermal
storage technologies during the latent heat storage process, phase
change material (PCM) is the most popularly working medium owing to
its high energy storage density, phase transition at constant temperature,
reversible phase change process, and thermal stability. Among the
investigated PCMs, the fatty acids, as one kind of typical PCMs, are
commonly preferred for latent heat energy storage due to their excellent
properties such as suitable phase change temperature, high heat latent
value, almost no supercooling, nontoxic, and so on.3,4

However, the drawbacks of the leakage problem during melted state
and low thermal conductivity of fatty acid significantly limit their
practical applications.5 Therefore, lots
of work have been done to overcome these drawbacks. Usually, fatty
acids are encapsulated into macro- or microdimension structure, namely,
microencapsulation technology.5−7 However, the microencapsulation
technology is relatively more complex with higher cost and lower thermal
storage capacity. Compared to the microencapsulation technology, another
option is to form stable encapsulation of PCM by using porous minerals
with developed pore structure, lightweight, and low cost, such as
kaolinite,8,9 graphite,10−12 perlite,13 meteorite,14 and
diatomite.15−18 Construction of porous material absorption systems has been demonstrated
by many researchers, and the previous work has proved that it can
effectively solve the liquid leakage problem and protect PCM from
external problems. On the other hand, to increase the thermal conductivity
of fatty acids, many high thermal conductivity materials have been
applied, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),3,19 which
are homogeneously mixed with fatty acids.20 The superior properties and feasibility of CNT enhancer have been
confirmed by many studies.21−25

Fly ash (FA) is the byproduct of coal-fired power generation
in
a thermal power plant. Particularly, in China, where coal is used
as the main energy source, thermal power accounts for more than 50%
of the whole electricity consumption. In 2015, the annual discharge
of FA is about 6.2 × 108 t in China. The treatment
and comprehensive utilization of FA have been one of the hot social
topics. Fortunately, FA possesses many similar properties with some
porous mineral that enables it to act as a carrier matrix to prevent
the leakage of melted fatty acid. Moreover, initial exploration studies
have confirmed the feasibility of this experiment.26−30 However, a lot of work still needs to be done to
evaluate the properties of FA-based PCM.

In this study, we aim
to develop a novel shape-stabilized phase
change material (SSPCM) by a facile synthetic method of direct impregnation.
Capric acid (CA) is considered to be one of the most promising fatty
acids for the most suitable phase change temperature approximate to
human comfortable temperature and high latent heat capacity. CNT,
as a kind of lightweight carbon material with high thermal conductivity,
has been widely used as the thermal conductivity enhancer of PCM.
Therefore, in this composite, the CA with a comfortable temperature
range and high latent heat acts as PCM. And raw FA and CNT serve as
the carrier matrix and thermal conductivity enhancer, respectively.
The various characteristic techniques were used to investigate the
thermal properties of these composites.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Theoretical Feasibility
Analyses of FA Used
for Support Material
The natural minerals can act as carrier
matrix due to the main characteristic of the porous structure. In
detail, the components in the natural mineral have different lattice
structures and crystal structures, which provide more pore structure
and larger specific surface area. Thus, the fatty acid and natural
minerals could be tightly combined by forces such as capillary force,
tension force, and drag force.31 Owing
to the similar mineral components and pore structure between FA and
some typical natural minerals, FA can also be used as a carrier matrix
in theory. A comparison of mineral components between FA and some
typical porous minerals is given in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, mineral components in FA are almost the
same as those in some typical natural minerals. The mineral components
such as SiO2, Al2O3, and MgO may
be used as porous material, whereas the components such as Na2O and K2O have a fluxing effect, which makes FA
possible to be used as supporting material of PCM. Therefore, acting
as carrier matrix of PCM is a new approach for the comprehensive utilization
of fly ash.

FA and Some Typical Natural Minerals32,33

2.2 Morphology of the CA/FA/CNT SSPCM
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of CA, FA, CNT, CA/FA PCM,
and CA/FA/CNT are shown in Figure 1. As can be seen from Figure 1a–c, CA exhibits a viscous-liquid-like
glue due to the lower phase-transition temperature. And FA has microsphere
structures like hairy spheres with different diameters. The CNT with
abundant pore structures was similar to cotton wool due to agglomeration
between particles. As seen from Figure 1d, after FA is impregnated with CA, the microsphere
structure surface of FA was covered by the impregnated CA to a certain
extent. CA/FA SSPCM reveals significant difference from FA. This displays
that specific amount of CA can be adsorbed into microstructure or
covered on the surface of the sphere of FA owing to surface forces.
In other words, it may be the reason that FA could prevent the leakage
of melted CA. It can be clearly observed from Figure 1e,f that the CNT is mixed with CA and covered
on the surface of FA or filled between spherical particles of fly
ash, which indicates that the CNT can successfully construct path
channels for heat transfer between CA and CA in comparison to CA/FA.

of CA (a), FA (b), CNT(c), CA/FA (d), and CA/FA/CNT
(e, f).

2.3 Chemical
Compatibility of CA/FA/CNT SSPCM
Figure 2 illustrates
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of CA, FA, CNT, CA/FA
SSPCM, and CA/FA/CNT SSPCM selected as samples on behalf of other
composites. As seen in Figure 2, in the spectrum of CA, the peaks at 939, 1410, and 1710
cm–1 represent stretching vibrations of −OH,
C=O, and COO– groups, respectively. Besides these peaks,
2850 and 2930 cm–1 can be ascribed to the symmetric
stretching vibrations of −CH3 and −CH2 groups, respectively.34,35 The FTIR spectrum of
FA, which shows peaks at 460, 576, 1079, and 1645 cm–1, signifies the stretching vibrations of O–Si–O, Si–O–Si,
Si–O–Al, and O–H, respectively.28 In the spectrum of CNT, the main absorption bands at 1600,
2900, and 3600 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching
vibration bands of −C=C–, −C–H,
and −O–H (due to humidity content), respectively.3,19 On the other hand, from the FTIR spectrum of CA/FA SSPCM and CA/FA/CNT,
it could be clearly observed for all of the characteristic peaks which
appeared in the curves of CA, FA, and CNT, there are no obviously
new characteristic peaks, which suggests that the interaction between
CA, FA, and CNT was only a physical process and the components in
the SSPCM have good chemical compatibility.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of CA, FA,
CA/FA, and CA/FA/CNT.

2.4 Thermal
Properties of CA/FA/CNT SSPCM
The thermal properties of CA,
CA/FA SSPCM, and CA/FA/CNT SSPCM were
determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the DSC
curves are shown in Figure 3 and Table 2. As easily observed from Figure 3 and Table 2, the melting temperature and solidifying temperature of CA
are 35.89 and 26.84 °C, with latent heat values of 169.5 and
167.6 J g–1, respectively. The melting and freezing
temperatures were determined as 31.53 and 28.17 °C, respectively,
for CA/FA SSPCM whereas they were measured as 31.08 and 27.88 °C
for CA/FA/CNT SSPCM. Compared to the pure CA, there are minor deviations
in melting temperature between 31.08 and 35.89 °C and in solidifying
temperature between 26.84 and 28.17 °C due to the weak physical
interaction among the components of composites. Fortunately, the melting/solidifying
temperatures are more suitable for human body comfort and closer to
the comfortable room temperature range of 16–26 °C. The
advantage is that CA can be used as PCM for thermal storage application
in buildings.

CA (20 wt %)/FA/CNT	31.08	20.54	27.88	20.19	this study	
On the other hand, as can be seen from Figure 3 and Table 2, the latent heat capacities of melting and
solidifying
were measured as 24.40 and 24.66 J g–1 for CA/FA
SSPCM, 20.54 and 20.19 J g–1 for CA/FA/CNT SSPCM,
respectively. And the latent heat values of CA/FA/CNT SSPCM were slightly
lower than those of CA/FA SSPCM. This indicates that the CNT enhancer
has no remarkable dropping effect on latent heat values of CA/FA/CNT.

Compared to latent heats found in some studies, the latent heats
of the prepared SSPCM in this study were higher than those of some
other SSPCM reported in the literature.36−40 The comparison results are also presented in Table 2. Therefore, it can
be concluded that the suitable phase change temperature and high latent
heat value of CA/FA/CNT make it more suitable for TES as ingredients
material in buildings.

2.5 Thermal Stability of CA/FA/CNT
SSPCM
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to estimate
the thermal
stability of the fabricated SSPCM, and the obtained results are illustrated
in Figure 4. As seen
from the curves in Figure 4, there is a single degradation process 80–320 °C
for CA due to the decomposition of fatty acid. The mass loss percentage
of CA was 99.92%, whereas the thermal degradation temperature limits
(°C) of CA/FA SSPCM and CA/FA/CNT are around 230 and 240 °C
respectively, which are much higher than their working temperatures
(16–26 °C). Moreover, the mass loss ratios of CA/FA SSPCM
and CA/FA/CNT are about 18.36 and 14.30% at temperatures 420 and 440
°C, respectively. In addition, the weight loss for SSPCM is almost
equal to the incorporation amounts of CA in each SSPCM. This finding
reveals that the FA is feasible to serve as the carrier matrix of
PCM. Good thermal stabilities of CA/FA SSPCM and CA/FA/CNT make them
more suitable for application in buildings.

and CA/FA/CNT.

2.6 Thermal
Storage/Release Performance of the
CA/FA/CNT SSPCM
The thermal storage/release performance also
revealed the heat transfer efficiency. The melting and cooling curves
of CA, CA/FA SSPCM, and CA/FA/CNT are shown in Figure 5 by thermal storage/release tests. The test
method of the melting and cooling curve in this study is the same
as the conditions in our previous report.18 To evaluate whether the storage efficiency of CNT composite is better
than the other composites without CNT or not, the time length of the
melting/freezing process (time from initial time/phase change point
to the phase change point/termination time) and the time length of
phase change constant temperature during the melting/freezing process
can usually be considered as the evaluation parameter. As it can be
seen from Figure 5,
during the melting process, it takes about 15, 13, 13, 12, 12, and
11 min for CA, CA/FA, CA/FA/CNT (1 wt %), CA/FA/CNT (3 wt %), CA/FA/CNT
(5 wt %), and CA/FA/CNT (7 wt %) to increase temperature from 16 to
32 °C, respectively. Compared to CA, CA/FA SSPCM, the melting
time of CA/FA/CNT was reduced by 26.67 and 15.38%, respectively. Similarly,
during the solidifying process, it takes about 14, 9, 7, 6, 5, and
4 min for CA, CA/FA, CA/FA/CNT (1 wt %), CA/FA/CNT (3 wt %), CA/FA/CNT
(5 wt %), and CA/FA/CNT (7 wt %) to decrease temperature from 32 to
16 °C, respectively. In comparison to CA, CA/FA PSPCM, the solidifying
time of CA/FA/CNT was reduced by 71.43 and 55.56%, respectively. In
addition, during the melting process, the maintaining times of equilibrium
temperature platform of CA, CA/FA, CA/FA/CNT (1 wt %), CA/FA/CNT (3
wt %), CA/FA/CNT (5 wt %), and CA/FA/CNT (7 wt %) are about 12, 7,
5, 3.5, 2.5, and 2 min, respectively. And in the solidifying process,
it takes about 11, 6, 4, 2.5, 2, and 2 min for CA, CA/FA, CA/FA/CNT
(1 wt %), CA/FA/CNT (3 wt %), CA/FA/CNT (5 wt %), and CA/FA/CNT (7
wt %) to maintain equilibrium temperature platform, respectively.
Correspondingly, the maintaining time of equilibrium temperature platform
of CA/FA/CNT (7 wt %) is less than that of CA and CA/FA by 83.33 and
71.43% for thermal storage and 81.82 and 66.67% for thermal release,
respectively. All of the results also confirm that CNT enhancer in
PSPCM can obviously improve the heat transfer efficiency.

release curves of CA, CA/FA, and CA/FA/CNT.

3 Conclusions
To overcome the drawbacks of
leakage and low thermal conductivity
of CA, a novel SSPCM of CA/FA/CNT was fabricated via the facile direct
impregnation method. The microstructure, chemical compatibility, thermal
properties, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, and thermal storage/release
performance of prepared SSPCM were investigated. The CA can be successfully
adsorbed by FA in a maximum fraction of 20 wt % without leakage of
CA. The SEM and FTIR analyses confirmed that there was no chemical
reaction among the components in SSPCM. The DSC results revealed that
the CA/FA/CNT had a phase change temperature of 31.08 °C for
the melting process and 27.88 °C for the solidifying process
as they indicated latent heat changed 20.54 J g–1 for melting process and 20.19 J g–1 for the solidifying
process. The TGA analysis showed that CA/FA/CNT had good thermal stability
above its working temperature. Moreover, the charging/discharging
time of CA/FA/CNT was shorted owing to the improved thermal conductivity
by CNT enhancer. In short, CA/FA/CNT has great potential in buildings
for thermal storage as ingredient material. At the same time, it could
provide a new approach for the comprehensive utilization of FA.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
CA was
provided from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The FA was supplied by
the Hebei Thermal Power Plant (Shijiazhuang, China). The granulated
FA sample was sieved using 0.250 mm mesh and then dried at 110 °C
for 2 h to remove the humidity. The CNT was obtained from Suzhou Tanfeng
Graphene Technology Co., Ltd (Suzhou, China).

4.2 Preparation
of SSPCM
The SSPCM of
CA/FA/CNT sample used in this study was prepared by the direct impregnation
method. The preparation process of the composite can be concluded
in two steps, as shown in Figure 6. In the first step, the weighed CA and FA were put
into a 25 mL beaker and evenly mixed. Then, the mixture was heated
at 60 °C for 10 min and slowly hand-stirred continuously. After
that, the sample was cooled to 20 °C for 2 h to obtain the fabricated
composite. And then the leakage tests of CA/FA were carried out according
to the effective method reported in the literature.41 For this purpose, samples including the different amounts
of CA were heated on filter papers by checking the leakage case. The
sample tablets of CA/FA composites used for the leakage test are shown
in Figure 7, and the
results are presented in Figures 8 and 9. In the next step, the
SSPCM CA/FA without liquid leakage at a specific weight was added
in powder form into 25 mL beakers and mixed with the CNT with different
mass fractions, respectively. Then, the mixture was heated at 60 °C
for 10 min and slowly stirred. After cooling, the SSPCM of CA/FA/CNT
was obtained. In this study, all of the samples are marked in Table 3.

The leakage
area and leakage ratio of the samples are important
parameters to accurately and objectively characterize the leakage
of liquid CA. The results are given in Table 3, Figures 10, and 11. In Table 3, the leakage ratio is the mass
of leaked CA divided by the total mass of CA in the corresponding
composites.31

Figure 10 Leakage area of CA/FA
composites with different mass fractions
of FA.

Figure 11 Leakage ratio of CA/FA composites with
different mass fractions
of FA.

As can be seen in Figures 8 and 9, as time goes on, the leakage
of CA with CA/FA composites becomes increasingly worse. Simultaneously,
the leakage of CA becomes increasingly weaker with the mass fraction
increment of FA due to the restriction and package of FA. And when
the mass fraction of FA is more than 60%, the composites start to
keep the shapes. Yet the leakage of CA is serious even though the
mass fraction of FA is up to 70%, which indicates that the package
efficiency of FA is not very good. This means that raw FA is suitable
for ingredients material in the whole building material application
rather than an aggregate material. Meanwhile, the S1-6 sample with
20/80 wt % composite which has no liquid leakage is characterized
as SSPCM in Figure 7. However, the liquid stain of the S1-6 sample shows a little liquid
leakage and can be negligible. Hence, the S1-6 sample was characterized
as SSPCM used in this study.

It can be seen from Figure 10 that there is a good linear
relationship between the
leakage area and mass fraction of FA. Namely, the leakage ratio of
CA/FA samples decreases with increasing mass fraction of FA. And a
similar relationship can be found between the leakage ratio and mass
fraction of FA in the CA/FA composites in Figure 11. The above-mentioned relationships can
be described by the following formulations: Y1 = −0.5416X1 + 49.5363, R2 = 0.9312, where Y1 stands for the leakage ratio of sample (cm2) and X1 stands for the mass fraction of the sample
(%); Y2 = −0.8433X2 + 75.6295, R2 = 0.9712,
where Y2 stands for the leakage area of
the sample (cm–2) and X2 stands for the mass fraction of the sample (%). Clearly, the leakage
area and the leakage ratio of the CA/FA sample with 80% mass fraction
FA are very small and negligible. Moreover, these may provide relatively
accurate and objective parameters to evaluate the leakage of PCM composites.

4.3 Characterization of SSPCM
The surface
morphologies of CA, CA/FA, and CA/FA/CNT were researched using a scanning
electron microscope. The chemical compatibility between the components
of composites was studied by FTIR in the wavenumber range of 400–4000
cm–1, with a resolution of 2 cm–1 using KBr pellets. The thermal stabilities of CA, CA/FA, and CA/FA/CNT
SSPCM were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, from 20 to
600 °C). The temperature fluctuation was 0.1 °C, and the
accuracy of DSC was 0.1%. The phase change temperature and latent
heat of CA, CA/FA, and CA/FA/CNT SSPCM were determined by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the measurement experiments were performed
at the heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min–1 under
N2 gas atmosphere in the temperature range of 10–60
°C. In addition, to examine the effect of enhanced thermal conductivity
on the heat-adsorbing and -releasing time of CA, CA/FA, and CA/FA/CNT
SSPCM, continuous cooling curve tests were carried out by the intelligent
paperless recorder in the range of −10 to 60 °C. The thermal
storage and release performances were determined by taking advantage
of the intelligent paperless recorder.
