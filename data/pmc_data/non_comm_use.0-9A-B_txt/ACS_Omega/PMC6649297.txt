Agglomeration
of copper nanowires (aspect ratios on the order of
1000) in polyethylene, commonly a major problem, could be prevented
by modification of the nanowires with a surface layer of oleylamine.
Nanocomposite films were prepared by mixing nanowire dispersions in
organic solvents with polyethylene solutions followed by casting,
drying, and sometimes hot pressing. Orientation of the copper nanowires
by solid-state drawing of the composites at elevated temperatures
led to preferential alignment of the nanowires in the drawing direction.
This arrangement gave rise to a uniform dichroism in the near-infrared
(NIR) region, which is uncommon in the case of the hitherto reported
dichroic nanocomposites. The NIR dichroism is ascribed to the high
aspect ratio of the metal wires. Hence, drawing of isotropic nanocomposites
with metal wires may serve for the manufacture of NIR polarization
filters.

Introduction
While nanocomposites of polymers and isotropic
(essentially spherical
or cubical) metal particles have been in the focus of a plethora of
studies, relatively few publications deal with nanocomposites comprising
anisotropic metal nanoparticles, in particular, nanorods.1−9 In these materials, mostly nanorods with an aspect ratio below 10
were applied, while larger aspect ratios (up to the order of 100)
have rarely been reported.1 Importantly,
composites with metal nanorods can feature particular optical properties
after drawing because of orientation of the nanorods in the drawing
direction.1−4 Nanorods are characterized by optical anisotropy in two directions.
As a consequence, the interaction of linearly polarized light with
metal nanorods is different in two directions. When the nanorods embedded
in a polymer matrix are preferentially uniaxially oriented by drawing,
the optical anisotropy of the material leads to different absorption
of light when the polarization plane of the light is oriented parallel
or perpendicular, respectively, to the drawing direction, similar
to parallel, linear aggregates of isotropic nanoparticles.10−19 Hence, the optical spectrum of such materials depends on the angle
between the drawing direction and the polarization plane of the incident
light. This phenomenon is designated as dichroism.

Dichroic
nanocomposites were prepared essentially with rodlike
silver and gold nanoparticles incorporated in poly(vinyl alcohol)1−4,6 or in cellulose triacetate.20 Notably, even nanorods with short aspect ratios
(2–4) were oriented already at small draw ratios (about 2),
although the orientation became more pronounced at a draw ratio of
4.4,6 Therefore, small draw ratios are sufficient to generate
dichroic nanocomposites, and consequently draw ratios up to 5 have
been commonly applied, while higher draw ratios (up to 8) were employed
only occasionally.4 Gold nanorods (aspect
ratios 3–4) were oriented in poly(ethylene oxide) during electrospinning,
presumed by the effect of the flow field during fiber spinning.7,8 The resulting thin fibers (diameters 40 nm to 3 μm) also exhibited
dichroism.

Dichroic nanocomposites were shown to act as polarization-dependent
color filters.17−21 Moreover, such materials are envisaged as security features for
documents and bank notes,20 and it was
demonstrated that they operate as switchable chromophores in liquid
crystal displays.17−19 Also, nanorods were converted to spherical nanoparticles
by laser pulses, which caused selective melting of the nanorods.3,20 Upon irradiation of the nanocomposites through a grid, the dichroism
vanished in the irradiated area, thus leading to a micropatterned
dichroism.3,20 Instead of a laser, a hot embossing stamp
was also used for this purpose.20

In the dichroic nanocomposites described so far, dichroism was
typically observed in the visible region of the optical spectrum,
and little attention has been paid to dichroism in the near-infrared
(NIR) region, although a dominant dichroism in the NIR region was
found in parallel aggregates of spherical gold nanoparticles.16 An increase in the aspect ratio of rodlike metal
particles should shift dichroism to the NIR region.1,2,9

In this study, we describe the preparation
of nanocomposites with
nanorods of very high aspect ratio, around 1000 (also termed nanowires).
Notably, this aspect ratio is an order of magnitude above the longest
aspect ratio of metal nanowires applied so far in dichroic nanocomposites,1 to our knowledge. We employed copper as the metal
and polyethylene as the matrix. Note that prevention of agglomeration
of copper nanowires in polyethylene is challenging because of the
incompatibility of the hydrophilic copper surfaces and the hydrophobic
polyethylene. These nanocomposites were subsequently drawn and the
dichroism was investigated. With regard to drawing, polyethylene is
particularly suited as a matrix22,23 as poly(vinyl alcohol)
often breaks already at a moderate draw ratio, and in addition, the
drawing process of poly(vinyl alcohol) depends on the ambient humidity.

Results
and Discussion
Copper nanowires were synthesized according
to the literature.24 The synthesis involves
the reaction between
copper(II) chloride and copper(II) acetylacetonate in a mixture of
oleylamine and octadecene. The formation mechanism of the copper nanowires
is based on three steps such as reduction of copper ions into metallic
atoms, formation of nuclei, and finally anisotropic growth of the
nuclei into one-dimensional structures.24 The nanowires were commonly around 100 nm thick and up to 100 μm
long (aspect ratio about 1000), as evident from scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images (cf. Figure 1A,B). Although the nanowires were quite linear, wires
with kinks also occurred (Figure 1A,B).

Figure 1 (A,B) SEM images of copper nanowires. The wires were deposited
by evaporating a droplet of the dispersion resulting from the synthesis
on a silicon wafer at ambient conditions. (C,D) Photographs of a composite
with 5.5% m/m copper nanowires in linear LLD-PE before (C) and after
(D) drawing (draw ratio = 5).

A linear low-density polyethylene (LLD-PE) was used in this
study
as a matrix for its good solubility and good drawability. As polyethylene
is highly apolar and copper highly polar, the compatibility of these
two materials is poor and as a consequence such systems strongly tend
to become inhomogeneous. However, in general the compatibility can
be improved in such cases by modification of the surface of the inorganic
component with apolar organic moieties, such as alkyl groups.25 Gratifyingly, when copper nanowires are synthesized
with a solution-phase procedure based on a reaction between copper(II)
chloride and copper(II) acetylacetonate in a mixture of oleylamine
and 1-octadecene, as-produced particles are functionalized with oleylamine
at their surfaces.24 The amine group is
coordinated to the copper surface and hence the alkyl group envelops
the copper nanowires and renders them apolar toward the environment.
Accordingly, the oleylamine-modified nanowires were readily dispersable
in organic solvents such as hexane or chlorobenzene. In fact, it turned
out that the oleylamine layer was crucial for nanowire dispersion;
notably, it was even important to use fresh oleylamine or oleylamine
stored in a glovebox, as otherwise poorly dispersible products were
obtained. We attribute this effect to oxidation of oleylamine moieties
as it is known for a long time that oleyl groups are sensitive toward
oxidation.26 The underlying chemical processes
are of complex nature and can also lead to dimerization and eventually
to polymerization of oleyl groups.

The preparation of nanocomposites
was aimed at fabricating them
from polymer solutions containing dispersed copper nanowires. In order
to obtain composites with well dispersed copper nanowires, the solvent
has to first provide a homogeneous dispersion of the nanowires, which
is stable toward sedimentation during processing. Second, the solvent
must be able to dissolve polyethylene. Decahydronaphthalene (decalin),
which is commonly used to dissolve polyethylene,27 did not yield stable dispersions of the copper wires. Therefore,
toluene, chlorobenzene, hexane, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene were tested
as dispersants, whereas the last two provided the most homogeneous
dispersions. As the solvation of polyethylene proceeds best at high
temperatures (since the polymer crystallites melt at around 120 °C)
1,2-dichlorobenzene was chosen for its higher boiling temperature
(179 °C compared to 68 °C of hexane).

Accordingly,
LLD-PE was dissolved in hot copper nanowire dispersions,
and the mixtures were subsequently cast and dried. In order to produce
flat films of LLD-PE, a hot press was used. Temperature and pressure
were optimized (the best parameters are indicated in the Experimental Section, the films became, for instance,
less homogeneous at lower temperatures). An image of a film thus produced
is shown in Figure 1C. The coloration of the film (5.5% m/m copper) is remarkably uniform
and indicates a homogeneous macroscopic distribution of the copper
nanowires in the film.

For the drawing experiments, small stripes
were punched or cut
out of the hot-pressed films. These stripes were subsequently stretched
at elevated temperatures by means of a Kofler heating stage. The influence
of the temperature on the stretching behavior is decisive. Best results
were achieved at 120 °C, where large and uniform stretching without
rupture was possible. Higher or lower temperatures resulted in preliminary
ruptures of the films. The drawing of the films led to a reduction
in thickness from about 100 to 25 μm, but not to an essential
shrinkage in the lateral dimension (cf. Figure 1D). Therefore, because of the lower film
thickness, the color of the sample is less intense in the drawn zone.

Compared to linear polyethylene, folding of the chains of LLD-PE
is affected by the alkyl groups of the comonomer.28 Upon drawing of LLD-PE, the degree of crystallinity increases,
promoted by strain-induced crystallization of amorphous chains.29 Also, the size distribution of the crystals
becomes narrower as defective crystals are rearranged into crystals
of improved quality. The orientation of the crystalline chains proceeds
fast, in contrast to the amorphous chains which orient slowly and
poorly.

Figure 2 shows SEM
images recorded with a back-scattered electron (BSE) detector, before
and after stretching of the films. The BSE mode is sensitive to a
heavier element like copper and is thus used as a straightforward
way to detect copper nanowires. It should be remembered, however,
that only objects in the vicinity of the surface of the films are
detected with this method. The copper appears white in the images
because the copper atoms scatter the electrons to a much higher extent
than the carbon and hydrogen atoms of the polymer matrix because of
the higher atomic number of copper. The copper wires appear somewhat
larger in lateral size than they are because of the high acceleration
voltage used in the BSE mode, corresponding to a large interacting
volume of the beam with the sample.

Figure 2 SEM images of a composite of LLD-PE and
5.5% m/m copper nanowires.
(A) Before drawing, (B) after drawing (the drawing direction is indicated
by the red arrow, draw ratio = 11).

The SEM image in Figure 2A reveals that the copper wires are, remarkably, well
dispersed
in the polyethylene matrix and not agglomerated. It seems, therefore,
that the oleyl groups at the surface of the copper wires efficiently
fulfil their function as a compatibilizer to the apolar organic polymer
matrix. Further, Figure 2A displays that the copper wires are randomly oriented before drawing.
However, by contrast, in the stretched state, the wires are oriented
preferentially along the drawing direction as shown in Figure 2B. Wires which are oriented
perpendicular to the drawing direction are essentially absent. Accordingly,
the drawing process led to an orientation of the copper wires.

It is expected that the orientation of the copper wires results
in a dichroism, as reflected in vis–NIR spectra. The absorbance
in the vis–NIR spectra depends on a number of factors. Besides
the concentration of the nanowires, their lengths and diameters, their
degree of orientation (which is also influenced by the fraction of
nanowires with kinks), as well as the draw ratio of the films (and
associated the film thickness) influence the absorbance. Note that
in particular, the lengths and diameters of the nanowires as well
as the fraction of nanowires with kinks may differ to some extent
in different samples. A dichroism was observed indeed, as evident
from Figure 3A, which
presents the vis–NIR absorption spectrum of a sample containing
copper nanowires in LLD-PE, recorded at different angles between polarization
plane of the light and the drawing direction (φ). At φ
= 0° the light is polarized parallel and at φ = 90°
perpendicular to the drawing direction. Basically, optical absorption
spectra of metallic, rodlike nanoparticles have two maxima, corresponding
to the longitudinal (parallel to the long axis) and transverse (perpendicular
to the long axis) surface-plasmon modes.30 The absorbance maximum around 575 nm for φ = 90°, shown
in Figure 3A, is attributed
to the absorption maximum of the transverse plasmon resonance.31 The absorption maximum at φ = 0°
appears to rise beyond the detection limit of our spectrometer, that
is, beyond 2000 nm because of the very long aspect ratios of the copper
wires, similar to rodlike gold nanoparticles with even lower aspect
ratios, which did not reveal a longitudinal absorption maximum either
within the spectrometer range.4

Figure 3 Vis–NIR
absorption spectra recorded with polarized light
for drawn PE films containing copper nanowires (φ denotes the
angle between the polarization plane of the light and the drawing
direction of the films. (A) LLD-PE (5.5% m/m Cu, film thickness 25
μm, draw ratio = 11). (B) UHMW-PE (0.65% m/m Cu, film thickness
88 μm, draw ratio = 6).

An isosbestic point arose at 650 nm. Isosbestic points are
common
in dichroic nanocomposites. They arise at wavelengths where the extinction
coefficients of the longitudinal and transverse plasmon resonances
are equal.1,17−19 The higher absorbance
at φ = 90° at wavelengths below the isosbestic point in
combination with the higher absorbance at φ = 0° at higher
wavelengths implies an orientation of the nanowires parallel to the
drawing direction,1,3,6,17−19 in line with the SEM
image in Figure 2B.
Notably, the dichroism is pronounced in particular in the NIR region,
with relatively constant absorbances for a given φ between 1000
and 2000 nm. So far, such a feature has not been observed in this
extent for drawn polymer–metal nanocomposites, to our knowledge.
A dichroism in the NIR region was reported for drawn nanocomposites
of poly(dimethylsiloxane) and elongated agglomerates of spherical
gold nanoparticles, however, the absorbances strongly depended on
the wavelength in those cases.16 Also,
it appears that the absorbances of the drawn nanocomposites comprising
silver nanowires of an aspect ratio of about 100 decreases linearly
beyond wavelengths of 900 nm.1

The
dichroism in the vis–NIR spectrum of samples with draw
ratio 5 did not differ significantly from those of samples with draw
ratio 10, in line with the observations in other systems with low-aspect-ratio
nanorods where it was found that orientation was essentially established
already at very low draw ratios (see Introduction).

For comparison, ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene
(UHMW-PE)
was also employed as a matrix for the copper nanowires. UHMW-PE is
more difficult to dissolve than LLD-PE because of its higher degree
of crystallinity, but 1,2-dichlorobenzene was found to be a valuable
solvent. As the method of solvent removal does not affect the hot-drawing
behavior of UHMW-PE,32 in this study the
solvent was simply evaporated by drying in air. When the initial UHMW-PE
concentration is very dilute, for example 0.1% v/v or below, the resulting
films may resemble a mat of single crystals and may become brittle
after drying because of a large number of grain boundaries and cracks.
This effect is reduced by formation of entanglements which become
more pronounced at higher initial concentrations. Nearly constant
nominal stress is obtained upon drawing of films prepared by casting
from 1% v/v solutions, which is in the range of the concentration
applied here.

Similar to LLD-PE, a 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution
of the polymer
could be mixed with a dispersion of the copper nanowires. In contrast
to LLD-PE, however, films with UHMW-PE could not be processed by hot
pressing because of the very high molar mass, and therefore the liquid
comprising UHMW-PE and copper wires was cast and the gel-like matter
which formed in the drying process was subsequently stapled onto an
aluminum support to minimize shrinkage during drying. Thus, films
with thicknesses in the range of 300–500 μm were obtained.
After drawing at 120 °C, the film thicknesses decreased to around
100 μm.

The drawn films with UHMW-PE showed a similar
dichroic behavior
as those with LLD-PE (Figure 3B), although the absorption maximum of the transverse plasmon
resonance was less distinctive with UHMW-PE. Nonetheless, an isosbestic
point at 650 nm also emerged with UMMW-PE as the matrix. According
to the results with LLD-PE as the matrix, the dichroism does not change
significantly beyond draw ratios of 5. As the samples become thinner
with increasing draw ratio, thus reducing their absorbance in vis–NIR
spectra, a draw ratio of 6 was applied with UNMW-PE as the matrix
polymer (Figure 3),
although UHMW-PE is suited to achieve much higher draw ratios. Orientation
of the UHMW-PE chains becomes pronounced upon drawing.33 During drawing, polymer chains are rearranged
into single-phase crystalline segments, and accordingly highly crystalline
UHME-PE is obtained, with degrees of crystallinity around 90% or more.

The linear absorbance behavior in the NIR region of the materials
comprising copper nanowires implies a high application potential as
an improved NIR polarization filter, which could be expedient for
suppression of undesirable polarization directions in integrated optical
circuits. As NIR radiation is responsible for surface heating, these
systems could also be useful for the development of intelligent surfaces
able to minimize temperature rising during summer. Because heating
in such materials is basically anisotropic,34 such materials can also serve as heat-shielding materials for space
vehicles.35

Conclusions
The
surfaces of copper nanowires have to be modified with organic
groups in order to achieve nanocomposites with randomly dispersed
nanowires in polyethylene as the rather hydrophilic copper surfaces
are not compatible with the apolar polymer matrix. Accordingly, copper
nanowires (aspect ratio on the order of 1000) were coated with a layer
of oleylamine. Thus, agglomeration of copper wires in the polyethylene
is almost completely suppressed. The crucial role of oleylamine is
underlined by the fact that only fresh oleylamine or oleylamine stored
in a glovebox under inert gas atmosphere results in copper nanowires
which can be dispersed in organic solvents. Such dispersions are a
good basis for the preparation of nanocomposites because they can
be mixed with polymer solutions, and films are subsequently obtained
by casting and drying.

The copper nanowires in the polyethylene
matrix were oriented by
a simple process, namely, by solid-state drawing of the composite
at 120 °C to ratios of 5 or more. During this process, the copper
wires oriented preferentially along the drawing direction. This was
reflected by a dichroism which was pronounced, in particular, in the
NIR region because of the high aspect ratio of the copper nanowires.
Notably, the results demonstrate that a rather constant dichroism
can be achieved with long metal wires in the NIR region, which is
untypical for dichroic systems established by drawing of nanocomposites
reported so far. Thus, the results imply that polymer-embedded metal
wires with high aspect ratio promote the preparation of NIR polarization
filters by simple drawing processes.

Experimental Section
Materials
The following chemicals were used without
further purification. 1-Octadecene (90%, technical grade) and oleylamine
(80–90%) were obtained from Acros Organics, New Jersey; Cu(acac)2 (99.99%), CuCl2 (99.999%), trioctylphosphine (97%),
hexane (95%), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (99%), pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate) (98%), and tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite (98%) from Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland;
linear LLD-PE (polyethylene no. 4, weight-average molar weight Mw = 7.7 × 104, 0.3% mol/mol
octene comonomer) from DOW Chemical, Midland; and UHMW-PE (GUR4120, Mw = 5 × 106) from Ticona, Frankfurt.

Synthesis of Copper Nanowires Coated with a Layer of Oleylamine
The synthesis of oleylamine-coated copper nanowires was performed
following the literature but with somewhat different quantities.24 Cu(acac)2 (0.168 g, 0.642 mmol) and
CuCl2 (0.1076 g, 0.8 mmol) were placed in a 30 mL glass
tube inside a glovebox. Octadecene (5 mL, 3.95 g, 16 mmol) and oleylamine
(5 mL, 4.07 g, 15 mmol) were added (it was important that the oleylamine
had not been exposed to the air previously). The vial was sealed with
a cap and parafilm, and the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic
stirring bar for 10 min at 300 rpm. After removing the sealed tube
from the glovebox, the vial was exposed to an ultrasonic bath (50
min, 37 kHz, 380 W, Elmasonic P 300H) until the compounds were completely
dissolved and a dark blue solution was obtained. Subsequently, the
tube was placed in an oil bath at room temperature and the reaction
mixture was stirred for 10 min at 300 rpm. The temperature was increased
to 120 °C, and held for 1 h under stirring. Afterward, the temperature
was increased to 180 °C and held there for 1 h, again under stirring.
The solution now appeared in a red-orange, transparent color. Trioctylphosphine
(1 mL, 0.83 g, 2.2 mmol) was added with a syringe and the solution
was stirred for another 15 min at 180 °C. The oil bath was removed
and the solution was allowed to cool down to room temperature. Sample
workup was performed by washing: hexane (10 mL) was added to the solution,
shaken, and centrifuged (Hettich Universal 320) for 2 min at 1000
rpm. The supernatant liquid was decanted, fresh hexane (10 mL) was
added, and the resulting mixture was shaken and again centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 2 min. This procedure was repeated twice. The nanowires
were finally dispersed in 10 or 25 mL hexane for further use.

Preparation
of Polymer Composites with LLD-PE
LLD-PE
granulate (around 0.75 g) was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10
mL) in a 30 mL vial at 130 °C in an oil bath by stirring for
12 h. The copper nanowires dispersed in 25 mL hexane as described
above were collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min) and redispersed
in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10 mL) by exposure to an ultrasonic bath (3
min, 37 kHz, 380 W). This dispersion was subsequently added to the
polymer solution and stirred for another 1 or 2 h at 130 °C.
To prevent flocculation of polyethylene, the dispersion of the nanowires
can be preheated to 130 °C. The polyethylene solution was then
transferred to a vessel with flat bottom, allowed to cool down to
room temperature and dried first in the air for 48 h and then in a
desiccator for another 8 h at a pressure of 10–2 mbar. The resulting composite was removed from the vessel and placed
between two kapton foils. These foils were placed on an aluminum sheet
and covered with a second aluminum sheet (Figure 4). This system was subjected to hot pressing
at 180 °C for 5 min with a load of 10 kN, using two steel plates
of dimension 14 cm × 14 cm. Aluminum is necessary to reach a
homogeneous pressure while the kapton foil prevents the PE film from
sticking to the aluminum. The thickness of the film was controlled
with two metal stripes of known thickness between the kapton foils.
Films with a nominal thickness of 100 μm were thus produced,
with a copper content of 5.5% m/m [determined by inductively coupled
plasma (ICP)–optical emission spectroscopy (OES)].

the pressing of films with LLD-PE matrix.

Preparation of the Polymer Composite with UHMW-PE
A
dispersion of Cu nanowires in 10 mL hexane, produced as described
above, was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The hexane was decanted
and the solid redispersed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10 mL) by exposure
to an ultrasonic bath (3 min, 37 kHz, 380 W). 1,2-Dichlorobenzene
(250 mL) and the dispersed Cu nanowires were mixed in a 500 mL three-neck
round-bottom flask, in order to avoid potential side reactions with
oxygen during processing. Pentaerythritol-tetrakis(3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate) (30 mg, 25 μmol,
“Irganox 1010”) and tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite (30 mg, 46 μmol, “Irgafos 168”)
were dissolved each in approximately 2 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and
added to the round-bottom 3-neck flask. The flask was heated to 150
°C using an oil bath. UHMW-PE powder (3 g) was added and a slight
flow of N2 (1–2 L min–1) was applied
at the side necks. The solution was now stirred by hand using a PTFE
crescent-shaped stirring rotor until the PE was completely dissolved
and a clear, reddish, viscous liquid was received (the solution was
too viscous to be stirred with a magnetic stirring bar). This liquid
was poured into a self-made aluminum basket (dimensions approximately
15 cm × 15 cm), made by folding a thin aluminum sheet into a
square shape with high walls at each side. After cooling down to room
temperature, the composite was left to dry in air. Excess supernatant
can be removed with a pipette occasionally to accelerate the drying
process. In order to prevent complete constriction, the film was stapled
to the bottom of the aluminum basket when the consistency was very
viscous and before it dried completely. Thus, films with thicknesses
in the order of 300–500 μm and a copper content of 0.65%
m/m (determined by ICP–OES) were obtained.

Drawing of
the Nanocomposites
The nanocomposites with
LLD-PE or UHMW-PE as the matrix polymer were cut into strips of dimension
1 cm × 3 cm, and the strips were subsequently cleaned with ethanol.
Thereafter, the strips were heated to 120 °C using a hot stage
(Wagner and Munz, System Kofler, Type WME) and manually drawn. The
draw ratio (final length divided by initial length) was determined
by measuring the elongation between two ink marks. Typically, draw
ratios of about 5–10 were accomplished.

Characterization of the
Films
UV–vis–NIR
absorption spectroscopy was performed on a PerkinElmer Lambda 900
UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer, equipped with polarizers.
The baseline of each angle of the polarizer position relative to the
sample was measured separately in presence of the empty sample holder
and subtracted from the measurement of the sample at the respective
angle. The curves were smoothed to reduce the noise in the lines by
using the average over five subsequent measurement points. Enhanced
noise around 850 nm arose from a change of the detector in the used
device.

Film thicknesses were measured using a Mitutoyo thickness
gauge. Elemental analysis of copper was carried out by the analytical
laboratories of Bachema AG, Schlieren, by ICP–OES. X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken on an Empyrean (PANalytical
B.V., Netherlands) powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα
tube, operating at 45 kV and 40 mA, and equipped with a PIXcel 1D
detector. The range from 10° to 100° was scanned.

SEM images were taken on a LEO 1530 Gemini instrument. The nanowires
were placed on a Si-wafer by evaporating a droplet of a dilute dispersion
and sputtered with 3 nm platinum. The wafer was placed on a carbon
tape to stick it to the sample holder. The composite sample was mounted
on the carbon tape as well. To prevent charging of the sample, a layer
of 5 nm Pt was sputtered on top. The composites were imaged using
BSEs for image formation.
