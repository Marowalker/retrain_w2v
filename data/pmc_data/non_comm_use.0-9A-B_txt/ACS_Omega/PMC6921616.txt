In this work, biologically significant 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones
have been synthesized using a silica-coated magnetic-nanoparticle-supported
1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)-derived and acid-functionalized
ionic liquid as the catalytic entity. The fabricated nanocomposite
catalyzes the pseudo-three-component reaction of isatins and indoles
explicitly via hydrogen-bonding interactions between substrates and
the catalyst. The nanocatalytic system utilizes water as the green
reaction medium to obtain a library of indolinones in good to excellent
yields under mild reaction conditions. Besides, the catalyst could
be easily recovered from the reaction mixture through simple external
magnetic forces, which enables excellent recyclability of the catalyst
for successive runs without appreciable loss in catalytic activity.
Hence, the outcomes of the present methodology make the nanocatalyst
a potential candidate for the development of green and sustainable
chemical processes.

Introduction
3,3-Di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones are one of the privileged heterocyclic
molecules that possess potential biological efficacies, including
spermicidal (Figure 1a),1 anticancer,2,3 and
α-glucosidase inhibitory properties (Figure 1b).4 One such
motif, namely, trisindoline, has also shown considerable activity
to inhibit Micobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv5 and cytotoxic effect against
both parental and multidrug-resistant cancerous cells (Figure 1c).6

Figure 1 Examples of biologically active 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones.

Due to these fascinating biological properties, a repertoire of
methods have been developed for the synthesis of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones,
each involving the participation of indoles and isatins as synthons
via a pseudo-three-component reaction. In this context, numerous metal
salts and complexes, such as Bi(OTf)3,7 Zn(OTf)2,8 Zr(salphen)Cl2,9 FeCl3,2 and (NH4)2[Ce(NO3)6],10 have produced the desired
indolinones in good to excellent yields. A range of other acid catalysts
such as p-toluenesulfonic acid,11 sulfamic acid,12 and Wells–Dawson-type
tungstophosphoric heteropolyacid13 have
also been utilized to carry out the synthesis. However, most of the
above methods are associated with one or more drawbacks, such as the
use of exhaustible metal reserves, harsh and corrosive acids, tedious
workup procedures, and unrecyclable catalysts. Therefore, various
heterogeneous catalysts have been fabricated and successfully utilized;14−19 nevertheless, their recyclability remains challenging due to cumbersome
and time-consuming filtration and centrifugation procedures.

In this regard, ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as green and recyclable
alternatives to both conventional solvents and catalysts.20,21 Since recent years, they have been involved in catalyzing reactions,
explicitly through hydrogen-bonding interactions, which were classically
catalyzed using metals and acids.22,23 They possess
low vapor pressures, high thermal and chemical stability, high ionic
conductivity, and a large solubility window that can dissolve both
organic and inorganic materials.24,25 All of these
features attribute green and environment-friendly credentials to organic
reactions. In this context, scientists have greatly acknowledged their
properties in the synthesis of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones. A variety
of ILs such as imidazolium-based,26 guanidinium-based,27 and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)-based28−30 cations have served their role as catalysts in the reaction of isatin
and indole. Although each and every catalytic system imparts good
to excellent yields, they offer large scope for improvement due to
associated drawbacks, including slow diffusion of substrates, tedious
product isolation, troublesome IL recycling procedures, and their
possible degradation during recycling.31

Thus, to enhance the catalytic efficiency and to make the catalytic
recovery more facile, immobilization of ionic liquids has emerged
as an ideal solution, which would combine the advantages of ILs and
heterogeneous solid support materials.32−34 For this, silica-coated
magnetite nanoparticles (SMNPs) would be the ultimate choice for catalytic
support due to their remarkable nanoscale dimensions leading to high
surface area to volume ratio, magnetic recoverability, ease of functionalization,
high thermal stability, and augmented dispersibility in polar reaction
media. The silica coating over magnetite nanoparticles also provides
resistance toward possible degradation and agglomeration, and thereby,
confers chemical stability.35−38

Therefore, as part of our continuing efforts to develop green and
sustainable nanocatalysts for various organic transformations,35,39−47 herein, we report the design, fabrication, and characterization
of a silica-coated magnetite-nanoparticle-supported DABCO-derived
and acid-functionalized ionic liquid for the synthesis of bioactive
3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones. Among a variety of IL synthons, DABCO
was selected for quaternization. It is a tertiary amine having sufficient
alkalinity and medium hindrance that help in facile reactions with
various groups. Its cagelike structure enhances the energy barrier
of nitrogen inversion by 7 kcal mol–1 in comparison
to trialkylamine.48−50 This makes the lone pair of nitrogen more localized,
which in turn increases its availability for the quaternization reaction.
After the successful synthesis of the supported IL, the nanocatalytic
system utilizes green reaction medium, mild reaction conditions, and
short reaction times to synthesize desired indolinones in good to
excellent yields. In addition, the catalyst confers effortless magnetic
recovery and excellent reusability, which contribute toward sustainability.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report wherein an
SMNP-supported acid-functionalized DABCO-based ionic liquid has been
utilized for the synthesis of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of the Catalyst
The synthesis of the catalyst
was performed in five steps, as illustrated in Scheme 1. For the fabrication of the catalyst, SMNPs
were chosen as the support material for immobilizing the required
task-specific IL. Initially, SMNPs were reacted with CPTMS to provide
a functionalization site. The obtained FSMNPs were further treated
with DABCO to form the first precursor of the required IL. After the
successful formation of DABCO-1@FSMNPs, functionalization was done
with 1,3-propane sultone and trifluoroacetic acid to deliver acidic
features to the final catalyst.

Characterization of the Catalyst
Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopic Analysis
FT-IR spectroscopy was used to confirm the successful formation
of the nanosupport and the grafting of the DABCO-based acid-functionalized
ionic liquid on the surface of SMNPs (Figure 2). In all spectra, absorption bands near
3400–3500 cm–1 are attributed to the presence
of surface hydroxyl groups. In Figure 2a, strong peaks at 632 and 586 cm–1 emerged due to Fe–O vibrations, which validate the synthesis
of Fe3O4 nanoparticles.51 The formation of the silica coating on MNPs is confirmed by the
appearance of intense peaks at 1090, 803, and 460 cm–1, which occurred due to the Si–O–Si stretching, Si–O
bending, and Si–O–Si bending vibrations (Figure 2b).52 In Figure 2c, only
marginal changes can be seen with strong dominant bands of the nanosupport.
The peaks at 2926 and 2855 cm–1 are ascribed to
the C–H antisymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of the
methylene group. Also, a weak peak at 1464 cm–1 appeared
due to aliphatic CH2 bending. The bonding of DABCO on SMNPs
is confirmed by the emergence of C–N stretching peaks at 1157
and 1200 cm–1.53,54 An additional
peak at 1392 cm–1 originates from the asymmetrical
stretching of S=O bonds of −SO3H groups.55 Besides, the weak peak at 1743 cm–1 is assigned to the vibrational modes of the carbonyl group in trifluoroacetate.
A difference in the position and intensity of the carbonyl peak is
observed, which can be attributed to the existence of ionic interactions
between the groups on the immobilized ionic liquid.56

X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
To determine the crystallographic
properties, structure, and size of the synthesized nanomaterials,
XRD analysis of MNPs, SMNPs, and DABCO-3@FSMNPs was performed (Figure 3). It was observed
that the position of all peaks in the XRD pattern of MNPs matched
with that of the standard XRD pattern of the cubic inverse spinel
structure of magnetite (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards
(JCPDS) card no. 19-0629). Figure 3a contains six strong Bragg’s diffraction peaks
at 2θ = 30.20, 35.53, 43.27, 53.80, 57.31, and 62.87°,
corresponding to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440)
crystalline planes of the magnetite phase, respectively.57 Furthermore, the above-mentioned peaks, with
no additional peaks, were obtained in the XRD patterns of SMNPs and
the catalyst, which prove retention of the magnetite structure in
the nanoparticles even after surface modification. However, the presence
of silica was not observed in the XRD spectra of SMNPs and the catalyst,
implying its high dispersity over the nanocomposites.58 XRD can also be used to estimate the crystallite size of
particles using the Scherrer equation, according to which Dhkl = kλ/β cos θ,
where Dhkl is the mean size of the crystalline
domains in a direction perpendicular to the lattice plane, hkl are the Miller indices of the plane under consideration, k is a dimensionless shape factor (0.89 for spherical particles),
λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15418 nm for Cu Kα), β
is the full line width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM; in radians),
and θ is the Bragg angle (in degrees). As per this equation,
the size of the magnetite nanoparticles was calculated, taking into
account the diffraction peak with the maximum intensity, and was found
to be approximately 11 nm.

Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopic (FE-SEM) Analysis
The surface morphology of the synthesized nanocomposites was studied
using FE-SEM. Figure 4a demonstrates that the MNPs are uniform spheres, whose surface becomes
rough and spongy after coating with silica (Figure 4b). The FE-SEM image of the final nanocatalyst
also reveals that the morphology of the catalyst remains intact even
after surface functionalization with various organic moieties (Figure 4c).

Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM) Analysis
TEM
analysis was done to gain insights into the size and structure of
MNPs, SMNPs, and the final catalyst, DABCO-3@FSMNPs. Figure 5a unveils the nearly uniform
and spherical nature of MNPs with an average diameter of 10.5 nm,
which is in good accord with XRD results. SMNPs can be viewed as spherical
core–shell nanoparticles with a dense magnetite core at the
center and a uniformly dispersed amorphous silica coating at the boundary
of MNPs (Figure 5b).
The thickness of the silica shell was measured to be 4–5 nm.
The electron micrograph of DABCO-3@FSMNPs reveals nearly similar structural
features to those in Figure 5b, conveying that surface modification does not alter the
morphology of SMNPs (Figure 5c). The size distribution diagrams of the nanosupport and
the catalyst are provided in Figure S1, which show that the size of MNPs, SMNPs, and DABCO-3@FSMNPs is 10–10.5,
18–20, and 20–21 nm, respectively.

Vibrating Sample Magnetometric (VSM) Analysis
The recyclability
of a catalyst depends on its capability to be recovered. Magnetic
nanocatalysts possess substantial features that are beneficial from
the viewpoint of green chemistry, such as effortless and economic
recovery, and thereby, sustainability. Consequently, the magnetic
properties of the fabricated nanocomposites were examined using VSM
at room temperature with a magnetic field varying from −10 000
to +10 000 Oe. Figure 6 illustrates that upon modification of MNPs with diamagnetic
silica and other organic moieties of the ionic liquid, the saturation
magnetization value (Ms) decreases from
MNPs (66.2 emu g–1) to SMNPs (35 emu g–1), and to the final catalyst (33 emu g–1). In spite
of the decrease in Ms values, the catalyst
could be easily recovered from the reaction medium with the aid of
an external magnet within a few seconds (Figure 6 inset). Besides, the magnetization curves
depict the superparamagnetic nature of the synthesized nanoparticles,
as no hysteresis loop, remanence, or coercivity was observed in any
of the curves.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
To acquire information
about the chemical composition of DABCO-3@FSMNPs, XPS analysis was
carried out (Figure 7a). In the high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p, two peaks were observed
at 725 and 711 eV, which were assigned to Fe 2p1/2 and
Fe 2p3/2 of Fe3O4, respectively (Figure 7b).59 Further, a peak at 104 eV was also seen, which confirmed
the presence of the silica coating over MNPs (Figure 7c). Moreover, the contribution from carbon
species was indicated by the peaks at 293 and 286 eV, which appeared
due to CF3 and C–C, C–O, and C=O,
respectively (Figure 7d).60 Also, two distinct peaks at 403
and 400 eV were observed in the N 1s region (Figure 7e).61 In addition,
the peaks at 533 and 690 eV were attributed to O 1s and F 1s, respectively
(Figure 7f,g).62 Besides, a peak at 169 eV was assigned to the
binding energy for the S 2p electron of the −SO3H group (Figure 7h).63 The elemental composition was also verified
by the presence of Fe, Si, N, O, F, and S in the energy dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDAX) spectrum of DABCO-3@FSMNPs (Figure S2).

(h) S 2p.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
The thermal stability
of the as-synthesized nanomaterials was studied using TGA. As depicted
in Figure 8a,b, the
TGA curves of MNPs and SMNPs show no substantial weight loss. In Figure 8c, the initial weight
loss (of about 4%) from room temperature to 280 °C is caused
by the evaporation of adsorbed water and other organic solvents that
were utilized during catalyst synthesis. As the temperature rises,
the catalyst gets broken down in two steps; 280–400 and 400–580
°C due to the decomposition of organic species that were used
for the formation and immobilization of the ionic liquid onto the
support.64,65 At higher temperatures, above 580 °C,
only a slight weight loss is observed, which indicates the presence
of remaining silica and Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

Catalytic Activity
The catalytic efficiency of the
synthesized catalyst, DABCO-3@FSMNPs, was investigated in the formation
of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-one derivatives via the pseudo-three-component
one-pot reaction of indoles with isatins. After going through the
literature reports, it was found that the reaction under consideration
has been carried out in a variety of solvents or solvent mixtures,
including CH2Cl2, CH3CN, C2H5OH, CH3OH, and H2O. However, considering
the impact of volatile-organic-compound-based solvents on human health
and the environment, H2O was chosen as the green solvent
for further studies. This will also reduce the dependence on fossil
fuels for obtaining carbon-based solvents.66 To commence the investigation, indole and isatin were selected as
the model substrates, which were reacted in the absence of the catalyst
under aqueous conditions (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). When no product was detected even
after 5 h, a catalytic amount of DABCO-3@FSMNPs was added (Table 1, entries 3 and 4).
The preliminary results were encouraging, as 96% of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-one
was obtained as the sole product under refluxing conditions (Table 1, entry 4). Hence,
to study the effect of temperature on product yield, the temperature
of the reaction was lowered from 100 to 70 °C (Table 1, entries 4–6). Results
indicated that 90 °C was the optimized temperature. To further
improve the reaction conditions, the amount of catalyst was varied
(Table 1, entries 7–9).
It was observed that on lowering the catalytic amount to 50 mg, no
substantial changes were observed; however, a further decrease was
not in favor of the product yield. The best results were obtained
with 50 mg of the catalyst. Finally, the effect of reaction time was
monitored (Table 1,
entries 10–12). To our delight, excellent yield of the desired
product was obtained in just 2 h (Table 1, entry 11). The catalytic efficiencies of
various precursor materials were also analyzed for the concerned reaction
(Table S1). However, no significant product
yield was observed in any of the cases, justifying the utility of
the DABCO-based acidic ionic liquid for the efficient synthesis of
3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-one derivatives.

With the optimized conditions in hand, we expanded our attention
toward a variety of indoles and isatins to synthesize a library of
3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones with 50 mg of the DABCO-3@FSMNP catalyst
under aqueous conditions at 90 °C in 2 h (Table 2). All reactions proceeded smoothly yielding
the desired products in good to excellent yields. Indoles having functional
groups, such as bromo and methoxy, were reacted with isatins containing
different halides (Table 2, entries 1-11). Remarkably, high product yields were obtained
in each case. Even the nitro group was well tolerated under identical
conditions (Table 2, entry 12). However, when 2-substituted indole was reacted with
isatin, no product was detected, which could be attributed to the
presence of steric hindrance between two 2-substituted indoles in
3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones (Table 2, entry 13).

Proposed Reaction Mechanism
On the grounds of optimization
results and previous reports, a plausible reaction mechanism has been
proposed for the synthesis of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones using
DABCO-3@FSMNPs as the catalytic entity. As depicted in Scheme 2, both cationic and anionic
species of the immobilized ionic liquid (I) participate in the formation
of hydrogen bonds with the reactants, indole and isatin, and hence,
catalyze the reaction through a relay of cooperative interactions
(II).67 Initially, the proton of the sulfonic
acid functionality activates the carbonyl carbon of isatin by acting
as an H-bond donor, thereby making the site more electrophilic.28 Simultaneously, trifluoroacetate accepts an
H-bond from the N–H of indole, and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic
attack of indole via its C-3 carbon on the electron-deficient carbonyl
carbon of activated isatin to generate species (III). Subsequently,
after hydrogen transfer (IV), dehydration takes place to form an intermediate
(V) where nucleophilic attack of another activated indole molecule
leads to the formation of the targeted product and regenerates the
catalyst.12,30

Using DABCO-3@FSMNPs
Catalyst Recyclability and Stability Test
Recyclability
is one of the fundamental features of a catalyst that controls the
economy and efficiency of a process at the industrial scale.68 Hence, to measure the efficacy of our catalyst,
catalytic recyclability studies were carried out using isatin and
indole as the model substrates. After each cycle, the catalyst was
separated from the reaction mixture, using a simple external magnet,
washed with acetone, and dried under vacuum for its subsequent usage. Figure 9 testifies that the
catalyst can be used for eight successive runs without any appreciable
decrease in product yield. To scrutinize any physicochemical changes
in the catalyst after recycling, various characterization techniques
were employed (Figure S3). The FT-IR spectrum
of the recovered catalyst shows no changes in the absorption peaks,
which authenticate that the chemical stability of the catalyst is
sustained. Also, FE-SEM and TEM images validate no morphological changes
in the recycled catalyst. Moreover, there is no substantial change
in the Ms values of the fresh and recovered
catalysts.

Figure 9 Recyclability test for the synthesis of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones
using DABCO-3@FSMNPs. Reaction conditions: isatin (0.5 mmol), indole
(1 mmol), recovered catalyst, H2O (2 mL), 90 °C, 2
h.

Besides, to test the possible leaching of catalytic species, the
reaction mixture was subjected to a split test. For this, during the
reaction of indole and isatin, the catalyst was removed from the reaction
mixture after 1 h. Afterward, the reaction medium was divided into
two equal halves. One of the two parts was continued under the catalyst-deficit
reaction conditions. After 4 h, the reaction was stopped, and the
two reaction mixtures were analyzed to determine the product yield.
Fortunately, identical yield of the desired product was achieved in
both cases, which overruled leaching and strongly confirmed the truly
heterogeneous nature of the catalyst. All of the above features contribute
toward the large-scale applicability of DABCO-3@FSMNPs in various
pharmaceutical applications.

Literature Precedents
To date, a variety of homogeneous
metal catalysts, acids, and ionic liquids have been utilized for the
successful formation of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones. Besides, various
supported acid catalysts and metal complexes have also furnished the
desired products in good yields. Table 3 outlines a brief summary of the literature reports
to compare the catalytic efficiency of DABCO-3@FSMNPs with that obtained
in previously reported methodologies. To our delight, the present
catalyst utilizes comparable reaction conditions and proves its supremacy
in terms of effortless magnetic recoverability and reusability up
to eight cycles.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated and characterized
a silica-coated magnetic-nanoparticle-supported acid-functionalized
DABCO-based ionic liquid. The as-synthesized nanocomposite showed
remarkable catalytic efficacy in the synthesis of various bioactive
3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones in good to excellent yields. Some of
the admirable features of the current catalytic system include utilization
of mild and ecofriendly reaction conditions, broad substrate scope,
and requirement of only a catalytic amount of the immobilized IL.
Also, when compared with the previously reported protocols, DABCO-3@FSMNPs
turned out to be a better catalytic entity in terms of effortless
magnetic recoverability and reusability up to eight consecutive cycles
without any significant compromise in either catalytic efficiency
or physicochemical properties. All of these features offer noncompetitive
opportunities for the use of DABCO-3@FSMNPs at a large industrial
scale.

water was used throughout the experiments.

Characterization Techniques
The as-synthesized nanocomposites
were thoroughly characterized using various physicochemical techniques
to gain insights into the composition, morphology, functionality,
crystallinity, stability, and other important characteristics. Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopic studies were carried out on a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 2000 using the KBr pellet method in a scanning range of 4000–400
cm–1. X-ray diffractograms were acquired on a Rigaku
MiniFlex in the 2θ range of 20–70° at a scan rate
of 2° min–1. Field-emission scanning electron
micrographs were collected using a Tescan LYRA 3 FE-SEM microscope.
Prior to sample preparation, clean metal stubs were glued with an
adhesive, such as conductive double-sided carbon tape in our case.
Furthermore, finely crushed and dried powdered nanoparticles were
mounted onto the stubs followed by coating with gold to make them
conductive using a Quorum Q150RS sputter coater. Transmission electron
microscopy images were acquired on a FEI TECNAI G2 T20
and Talos cryo TEM instrument. TEM samples were prepared by casting
a drop of dispersed nanoparticles, in ethanol, on carbon-coated copper
grids. ImageJ software was used for determination of size of nanoparticles
using TEM images. An AMETEK EDAX system and a K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer were used to analyze the elemental composition of the
supported ionic liquid. Magnetization values of the nanocomposites
were measured on a MicroSense ADE-EV9 at room temperature between
−10 000 and +10 000 Oe. Thermogravimetric curves
were acquired using a Linseis TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere with
a gas flow of 2 L h–1 and in the range of room temperature
to 850 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. Finally, the synthesized organic compounds were characterized using
a 1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) JEOL JNM-EXCP-400
nuclear magnetic resonance spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded
in DMSO-d6. Chemical shifts (δ)
for proton and carbon are reported in parts per million (ppm) units
downfield from tetramethylsilane (internal standard) and data are
documented as chemical shift (multiplicity, coupling constant, integration).

Catalyst Preparation
Synthesis of the Nanosupport (SMNPs)
Considering the
benefits of magnetically separable catalysts, silica-coated magnetic
nanoparticles (SMNPs) were chosen as the catalytic support. Magnetite
nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized using the coprecipitation technique.71 Initially, 6.0 g (15 mmol) of ferric sulfate
hydrate and 4.2 g (15 mmol) of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate were dissolved
in a round-bottom flask containing 250 mL of double-distilled water.
The above solution was stirred at 60 °C until the solution turned
yellowish-orange. Next, 15 mL of aqueous ammonia (25%) was added into
the above solution to adjust the pH to 10. After stirring for an additional
30 minutes, the black precipitate obtained was separated using an
external magnet, washed several times with double-distilled water
(until the pH turned neutral), and dried in a vacuum oven. To obtain
a silica coating over MNPs, the sol–gel method was adopted.72 For this, 0.5 g of MNPs were activated in 2.2
mL of 0.1 M HCl solution. Furthermore, the activated MNPs were dispersed
in a 250 mL mixture of ethanol and double-distilled water (4:1) in
an ultrasonic bath. Next, 5 mL of aqueous ammonia (25%) and 1 mL of
TEOS was added dropwise during sonication. The solution was then stirred
at 60 °C for 6 h. The resultant brownish precipitate was separated
magnetically, washed with water and ethanol until neutral conditions,
and finally dried in a vacuum oven to obtain amorphous SMNPs.

Functionalization of SMNPs (FSMNPs)
The as-synthesized
SMNPs were functionalized with CPTMS. The synthesis was carried out
using 1.0 g of dispersed SMNPs in 100 mL of dry toluene and adding
20 mmol of CPTMS under reflux conditions in a nitrogen atmosphere
for 24 h. The solid obtained was separated magnetically, washed with
diethyl ether, and dried in a vacuum oven to obtain FSMNPs.

Surface Modification of FSMNPs
FSMNPs were surface
modified to obtain the DABCO-based ionic liquid. FSMNPs (1.0 g) were
dispersed in 100 mL of acetone under ultrasonication. Furthermore,
20 mmol of DABCO was added to the above solution and refluxed under
air for 36 h. The so-formed solid was magnetically separated, washed
several times with acetone, and dried in a vacuum oven to obtain DABCO-1@FSMNPs.
These nanoparticles were further modified to quaternize the other
nitrogen. For this, 1.0 g of DABCO-1@FSMNPs were dispersed in 100
mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) under ultrasonication, followed by
addition of 20 mmol 1,3-propane sultone and further refluxing for
24 h. The obtained DABCO-2@FSMNPs were magnetically separated, washed
with THF and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven.

Acid Functionalization of FSMNPs (DABCO-3@FSMNPs)
Lastly,
to obtain silica-coated magnetic-nanoparticle-supported DABCO-based
acidic ionic liquid, 1.0 g of DABCO-2@FSMNPs were dispersed in 50
mL of dry toluene. Further, 20 mmol trifluoroacetic acid was added
dropwise into the dispersed solution. After the addition was completed,
the solution was heated at 150 °C for 12 h. The final nanocatalyst,
DABCO-3@FSMNPs, was magnetically separated, washed with diethyl ether,
and dried in a vacuum oven.

General Reaction Procedure for the Synthesis of 3,3-Di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones
The synthesis of 3,3-di(indolyl)indolin-2-ones involves the reaction
of indoles and isatins. For the reaction, 1 mmol indole and 0.5 mmol
isatin were mixed in a 10 mL round-bottom flask containing 2 mL of
distilled water. Further, DABCO-3@FSMNPs were added and heated in
an oil bath at the specified temperature under constant stirring.
The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After the completion
of the reaction, a small amount of acetone was added and the catalyst
was effortlessly separated from the vessel using an external magnet.
The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the crude product
was further subjected to column chromatography with silica gel as
the stationary phase and methanol/dichloromethane (2:98) as the eluent.
