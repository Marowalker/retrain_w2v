In HPLC, the nonlinear behavior of the retention factor k′ with temperature (dependence of ln k′ on 1/T) can be attributed to the multiple
interactions of a unique analyte in the separation process and/or
to the existence in solution of multiple forms of the analyte (also
leading to different free enthalpies of interaction). In this study,
several examples of nonlinear retention–temperature dependence
are evaluated for both reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction
chromatography (HILIC) separations.
The potential explanation for nonlinear retention–temperature
behavior is evaluated for each example, some caused by multiple interactions
in the separation system of a unique analyte and others by multiple
forms of the analyte. In cases where the analyte does not have more
forms and the separation is based predominantly on one type of interaction
(e.g., hydrophobic interaction in RP-HPLC), the dependence is linear,
as expected. By studying the changes in the chemical structure of
a compound as a function of pH it is possible to decide, in many cases,
if a unique form or multiple forms of a compound are present in the
solution. The use of this information allows us to determine when
the lack of linearity (when present) is caused by multiple interactions
in the separation system (for one form of the compound) and when more
forms are causing the lack of linearity. The approximation with a
quadratic form for the nonlinear dependence has been verified in most
cases to be good, and only minor improvements were obtained when using
higher polynomial dependencies.

Introduction
The dependence of a partition equilibrium
constant K on temperature (e.g., ref (1)) can be expressed by the
formula 1  where ΔG0 is the variation in the standard free enthalpy (Gibbs
free energy) for the process and R is the gas constant,
8.314 J/mol·K. This formula can be applied in HPLC to the equilibrium Am ↔ As where
analyte A is distributed between the stationary phase
“s” and the mobile phase “m”. For a chromatographic column having the phase ratio Φ,2 the retention factor k′
for the analyte A is given by the formula 2  

In this case, the dependence
of k′(A) on temperature can
be expressed as follows: 3  

In eq 3, the expression ΔG0 = ΔH0 – TΔS0 was utilized (ΔH0 is the change in standard enthalpy, and ΔS0 is the change in standard entropy). This formula
is known as the van’t Hoff equation and indicates a linear
dependence of ln k′ on (1/T) when ΔS0, ΔH0, and Φ are assumed independent of temperature,
although this assumption is only an approximation.3Equation 3 can be written in the form 4  

Various studies were
performed for HPLC to verify experimentally eq 4, indicating that, for a number of HPLC separations,
the linearity of the van’t Hoff equation is in good agreement
with experimental data (e.g., refs (4−7)). In such cases, parameters a and b can be determined by fitting the line representing ln k′(A) as a function of (1/T), and when ln Φ is known, the values for ΔS0 and ΔH0 of the process
can be estimated using the expressions 5  

However, in practice,
the linearity of the dependence of ln k′(A) on (1/T) is not obtained for all HPLC
separations (e.g., refs (8−11)). Such cases are known as nonlinear
van’t Hoff dependencies. Both secondary equilibria9,10,12 and multiple retention mechanisms12 or interactions13,14 have been
suggested to cause nonlinear van’t Hoff dependencies. The present
study shows that a major cause of nonlinear van’t Hoff dependencies
is the existence of multiple mechanisms of interaction between the
analyte and the phases in HPLC. Multiple interactions can appear for
some compounds because they are present in more than one form in solution,
but in other cases, because the HPLC process involves different interactions
of the analyte during the chromatographic process. Temperature may
influence similarly or differently each retention mechanism, leading
to linear or nonlinear van’t Hoff dependencies. Other changes
with temperature, such as the conformation of the stationary phase,
may contribute to the differences in retention, but such change would
be expected to affect similarly a whole group of analytes.

Theory
Assuming a unique compound and a unique separation
mechanism, only one thermodynamic potential ΔH0 and one ΔS0 should
be assigned, and the variation with the temperature T for these is given by the expressions (e.g., ref (15)) 6  and 7  where ΔCp is the variation in heat capacity. Although Cp for solid and liquid solutes also varies with
temperature to a certain extent,16 this
variation is usually very small. With these corrections, for temperatures
in a range relatively close to T0, by
taking with a good approximation ΔCp ln(T/T0) ≈ 0,
the dependence of ln k′ on temperature will
be described by the formula 8  

For a value T = T0 or T ≠ T0 but ΔCp = 0, eq 8 is identical with eq 3. Both eqs 3 and 8 indicate that, with a good approximation, ln k′ should depend linearly on 1/T, as indicated by eq 4. In reality, the linear dependence of k′
on 1/T is verified only in some cases, and nonlinear
behavior is relatively common.

The nonlinear dependence of ln k′ on 1/T can be explained considering
that, during the process Am ↔ As where the molecular species A is distributed between the mobile phase (m) and stationary phase
(s), more than one type of interaction takes place between the analyte
and the stationary phase and mobile phase in the HPLC process and
these interactions are influenced differently by the temperature.15 The different interactions may be caused by
the fact that the analyte is present in more than one form in the
solution (e.g., tautomers9,10,12) with each form having its own interaction with the stationary phase
and consequently a different equilibrium constant. Each constant may
vary differently with temperature. However, even when the presence
of different forms of an analyte is not plausible, nonlinear dependencies
are possible. It is known (e.g., ref (17)) that the HPLC process frequently involves more
than one mechanism of separation. Even in the reversed phase (RP-HPLC)
where the hydrophobic interactions play a dominant role, other interactions
are present.18 The separations in HILIC-type
HPLC or in the case of chiral chromatography are, in particular, known
to have contributions from a combination of mechanisms (e.g., refs (13, 14, 19) and (20)). It is only in some cases
of RP-HPLC in the separation of analytes of low polarity in that it
can be considered that one truly dominant type of interaction (hydrophobic)
explains the whole process. Even when more than one separation mechanism
is involved, the linearity between ln k′ on
1/T can be maintained if all processes are influenced
equally by the temperature. In other cases, either because of different
forms of the analyte or because different separation mechanisms are
affected differently by temperature, the linearity is not fulfilled.

Considering, for example, only two different mechanisms and, for
simplification, that a partition process takes place between the stationary
phase and mobile phase, the expression for K(A) can be written in the form 9  where indices “1”
and “2” indicate either different molecular structures
or that the unique type of molecules undergo two different separation
mechanisms. Each mechanism can be assumed as described by a different
equilibrium constant: 10  

A formal equilibrium
can be considered to exist between the molecules separated by the
two different interactions, such that a constant K21 can be defined by the formula 11  

From eqs 9–11, the following formula can be written for K(A): 12  

Each constant is related
to a corresponding free-enthalpy value ΔG (index
of “0” omitted for simplicity of writing). For the constant K21, the free energy corresponds to the difference
in the free energies of the two retention processes. As a result,
the expression for K(A) can be written
in the form 13  

The expression for
ln K(A) can be written in this case
in the form 14  

Equation 14 can be represented in a Taylor series and
will have the general form (e.g., see ref (9)) 15  

By neglecting the
terms in (1/T)n for n > 2, the approximation of the dependence of ln K(A) on (1/T) and therefore
of ln k′(A) will have a quadratic
form (where a = a′ + ln Φ)
as follows: 16  

In eq 15, it is difficult to estimate how
fast is the convergence of the Taylor series and therefore how good
is the approximation (eq 16) for the dependence of ln k′ on (1/T). In many cases, however, the experimental data describing
the dependence of ln k′(A) on 1/T fits quite well in a quadratic dependence.
In such cases, the values for a, b, and c can be obtained by quadratic fitting of
the experimental dependence of ln k′(A) on 1/T. When the values for a, b, c, and ln Φ
are known, a value for ΔH(T) and ΔS(T) can be obtained
from the expression 17  

The use of the first
derivative in (1/T) of both sides of eq 17 will generate the expression 18  

With a good approximation,
it can be assumed that the following relation is valid: 19  and the expression
for ΔH(T)15 will be the following: 20  

By replacing the value
of ΔH(T) in eq 17, the expression for ΔS(T) is the following: 21  

Equations 20 and 21 indicate that
the nonlinear dependence of ln k′ on 1/T is caused only by the nonlinear dependence of entropy
variation with 1/T. However, this is a result of
assuming that eq 19 is
correct. In the case that eq 19 is not fulfilled, both entropy variation and enthalpy variation
with temperature may contribute to the lack of linearity of the dependence
of ln k′ on 1/T. In this
case, the calculation of ΔH(T) and ΔS(T) is not anymore
possible from the values of a, b, and c of eq 17.

A chromatographic process based on adsorption
equilibrium (and not on partition) would not change the results previously
discussed. Also, the previous discussion can be easily extended for
more than two interactions and a combination of partition and adsorption,
all leading to nonlinear dependence of ln k′
on (1/T) (deviation from van’t Hoff dependence).
The present study examines several experimental cases of separation,
some with linear and some with nonlinear dependence of ln k′ on (1/T), and discusses a potential
explanation for the results in light of the previous theory.

The nonlinear dependence described by eq 16 can be mathematically characterized by an
extreme value of ln k′ (having a maximum or
minimum point in the given temperature interval). The temperature
for this value can be obtained from the condition d( ln k′)/d(1/T) = 0. This condition shows that, for T = −2c/b, the value of ln k′ is either a maximum or minimum and can be situated
within the studied temperature interval for van’t Hoff dependence
or outside this interval.

Experimental Section
Materials and Instrumentation
Methanol (MeOH) and acetonitrile
(AcCN) were of HPLC (gradient) grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Germany). The studied compounds (uracil, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
propylbenzene, propylparaben, butylparaben, sildenafil, and histidine)
were of proanalysis grade and purchased from Merck (Germany). The
additives (phosphoric acid and ammonium acetate) used for specific
aqueous components from the mobile phase were of proanalysis grade
purchased from Merck (Germany). Water of HPLC purity was obtained
within the laboratory with a TKA Lab HP 6UV/UF instrument (Thermo
Scientific). Solutions with a 100 μg/mL concentration of the
studied compounds were made in acetonitrile.

The HPLC experiments
were performed using an Agilent 1100 Series LC system (Agilent Technologies)
consisting of the following modules: a degasser (G1379A), binary pump
(G1312A), autosampler (G1313A), column thermostat (G1316A), and diode
array detector (G1315A). Chromatographic data were acquired by means
of Agilent Chemstation software rev. B.01.03.

Several columns
were used in this study, and some of their characteristics are described
in Table 1. All columns
that have a C18 stationary phase are endcapped, and they were new
and tested before usage according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

Chromatographic Conditions
Injections of 1 μL
of mixture solutions containing 200 μg/mL concentrations of
each analyte were used. Retention times longer than 60 min were not
considered in this study, and the compounds eluting after this value
(at a high water content in the mobile phase) were washed out with
a pure organic modifier, and the column followed a re-equilibration
step at the mobile phase composition applied to the next run. All
separations were performed at a flow rate of 1 mL/min unless specified
for a particular situation. Detection was performed in UV at 254 nm.
The temperature domain used in this study was 20–50 or 20–60
°C for different compounds evaluated.

Various mobile-phase
compositions were used, as described in the following section, for
several cases discussed in this study. The mobile-phase compositions
were generated using an organic solvent (AcCN or MeOH) and aqueous
component by appropriate settings for the pump (the solvents were
not premixed).

The values of the retention factor (k′) were calculated according to the common expression (e.g.,
see ref (17)) 22  where tR is the absolute retention time for the analyte and t0 is the dead-time indicator, which was measured
for each composition and temperature from the retention time of uracil
(for the RP mechanism) and toluene (for the HILIC mechanism).

Results and Discussion
Examples of Linear van’t Hoff Dependence
An
example of a linear van’t Hoff dependence is shown in Figure 1 for the homologous
series from benzene to propylbenzene with separation on a Gemini C18
100 × 4.6 mm column with a 5 μm particle size in the temperature
range between 20 and 50 °C. The separation (in the isocratic
mode) used a mobile phase of 45% water and 55% acetonitrile (an example
of separations within the indicated temperature range is given in Figure 1).

Figure 1 Overlaid chromatograms
for the separation of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and propylbenzene
on the C18 column using a mobile phase with 45% water and 55% acetontrile
(v/v) at various indicated column temperatures.

The R2 values for the
linear correlations shown in Figure 2 prove that the separation follows closely the theoretical
prediction, as expected for a process dominated by a single type of
interaction (hydrophobic) and with molecules present in a unique form.

Figure 2 Example
of linear van’t Hoff dependence in the range of 20 to 50 °C

C18 column with water/AcCN 55/45 v/v as the mobile phase.

The results from Figure 2 allow the evaluation of ΔH0 and ΔS0 assuming at
a given temperature a phase ratio of Φ = 0.25 for the Gemini
C18 column.21 These results are given in Table 2, and they indicate
as expected that the retention process is enthalpy-driven and that
some loss of entropy takes place when the molecules are retained in
the stationary phase. The entropic contribution to the variation in
the standard free enthalpy (−TΔS), calculated for 298.15 K based on eq 5, is situated within the interval of 0.06
and 2.5 kJ/mol, having a contribution for the evaluated temperature
lower (in the absolute value) than that of the enthalpy term (Table 2). Also, it can be
noticed that this contribution increases with the increase of the
hydrophobic character of the aromatic hydrocarbon, as expected. Overall,
the free-enthalpy variation (at 25 °C), ΔG0, increases with an increment of −1.0 to −1.1
kJ/mol for the methylene group, which is in accordance with some reported
values for the retention of these aromatic hydrocarbons.22

Other columns and mobile-phase compositions were evaluated.
These included the columns Ultisil XB-C18 (Welch) and BDS Hypersil
C18 (Thermo Scientific). For these columns two compositions were used
for the mobile phase: water/AcCN 45/55 and water/AcCN 50/50. For all
experiments, linear van’t Hoff dependencies were obtained with R2 values between 0.9970 and 0.9995. In these
separations, it can be assumed that the dominant type of interactions
is the hydrophobic ones (e.g., see ref (17)) since the analytes are not polar and the stationary
phase is a nonpolar C18.

Linear van’t Hoff dependencies
in the range of 15 to 60 °C were also obtained, for example,
for the separation of two alkylparaben analytes separated on a monolithic
C18 column (Chromolith Performance RP-18) with the mobile phase of
a 50/50 aqueous solution of 0.1% H3PO4/methanol.
The graphs are shown in Figure 3. The R2 values for this case
were between 0.9988 and 0.9990. The values of ΔH0 and ΔS0 for the two
parabens (Table 2)
are much higher than the values obtained for aromatic hydrocarbons,
but the values of ΔG0 for parabens
are very close to those of the studied hydrocarbons.

Figure 3 Example of linear van’t
Hoff dependence 20 to 60 °C for propylparaben and butylparaben
on a monolithic C18 column (Chromolith Performance RP-18) with a 50/50
aqueous solution of 0.1% v/v H3PO4/methanol
as the mobile phase (mobile-phase flow rate: 2 mL/min).

The linear van’t Hoff dependence can also
be interpreted as caused by the dominance of hydrophobic interactions
between the analytes and the C18 column with a minor contribution
from other potential types of interactions due to the presence of
polar groups in propyl or butylparabens.

Examples of Nonlinear van’t Hoff Dependences on C18 Columns
Nonlinear dependences of ln k′ on 1/T have been previously reported in the literature, for example,
for piroxicam, drotaverine, vincamine, and epivincamine at different
pH values for the mobile phase.9 For drotaverine,
for example, the van’t Hoff plots on a Zorbax XDB-C18, 150
× 4.6 mm, column with 3.5 μm particles for three different
pH values are shown in Figure 3 (according to the data reported in ref (9)). The utilized mobile phase
was 62.5/37.5 aqueous buffer/acetonitrile at an apparent pH (pHapp)23 at 2.5 or 4.5, and of the
mobile phase 50/50 aqueous buffer/acetonitrile at pHapp 9.0 is shown in Figure 4. The variation with the pH of the drotaverine forms in solution
is shown in Figure 5. The results from Figure 5 indicate that, with a good approximation, at the pH values
from 2.5 to 4.5, the ionic form of the compound is dominant (and unique).

Figure 4 Example
of van’t Hoff dependence between 20 and 50 °C for drotaverine
on a Zorbax XDB-C18 column and water/acetonitrile at different pH
values.

Figure 5 Variation with the pH of different forms of the drotaverine
molecule in the solution.

For the nonionic form of the analyte where the
interactions with the C18 column are expected to be mainly hydrophobic
and with little contributions from other types of interactions, the
van’t Hoff dependence is linear. On the other hand, for the
ionic form of the analyte, nonlinear van’t Hoff plots are obtained.
This is an indication that, besides the hydrophobic interactions typical
for an RP-HPLC separation, the ionic form dominant at pHapp = 2.5 or pHapp = 4.5 has other types of strong interactions,
and their intensity depends on the temperature. The presence of other
forms at these pHapp values is not likely for drotaverine,
and the nonlinear dependence is likely to be caused only by different
types of interactions between the analyte and the separation system
(mobile phase/stationary phase).

The quadratic curve given by eq 16 for the nonlinear dependence
of ln k′ on 1/T for drotaverine
at pH 2.5 provides a value of R2 = 0.9973,
which indicates a good fit. According to eq 15, eq 16 is however only an approximation, and including higher terms
(in 1/T) should provide an even better fit of the
data. This is indeed the case, and for a cubic approximation, R2 = 0.9976, for a quartic approximation, R2 = 0.9979, and for a quantic approximation, R2 = 0.9980. The relatively small increase in R2 for the description of the dependence of ln k′ on 1/T with higher polynomial
expressions shows that these higher approximations do not add significant
advantage compared to the quadratic expressions, which was typically
reported in the literature for some systems (e.g., refs (9, 10, 12), and (15)).

Similar behavior
was observed for sildenafil, eluted under two different mobile-phase
compositions (several examples of chromatograms obtained by its elution
in a mobile phase with 65/35 v/v water/acetonitrile are shown in Figure 6). Thus, the nonlinear
dependences between ln k′ and 1/T have been noticed for sildenafil separated on a Gemini C18 column
using a mobile phase of 65/35 v/v water/acetonitrile (Figure 7A) or an aqueous solution of
H3PO4 at pH 2.5 and acetonitrile 60/40 v/v (Figure 7B).

Figure 6 Overlaid chromatograms
for the elution of sildenafil on a C18 column for a mobile phase consisting
of 65/35 (v/v) water/acetonitrile at various indicated column temperatures.

Figure 7 Nonlinear van’t Hoff dependence in the range of
20 to 50 °C on a C18 column for sildenafil for (A) uncontrolled
pH (water/acetonitrile) and (B) with pH = 2.5.

A thermodynamic analysis of the van’t Hoff
plot from Figure 7B
shows two different contributions of the enthalpy and entropy to the
retention process. Up to a maximum retention at a column temperature
calculated from the previously mentioned formula (T = −2c/b = 308.15 K or 35
°C), the retention is entropy-driven. For a higher column temperature,
the retention process becomes enthalpy-driven. Thus, the variation
of enthalpy for the compound transfer from the mobile phase to the
stationary phase at 293.15 K calculated with eq 20 and the regression parameters given in Figure 7B becomes ΔH = +9.0 kJ/mol, while for the temperature of 323.15 K,
the value of ΔH is −8.1 kJ/mol. Similarly,
with the aid of eq 21, the variation of entropy at 293.15 K is ΔS = +37.2 J/mol·K, while for 323.15 K, the value of ΔS becomes −18.6 J/mol·K when we consider a constant
value of the phase ratio of Φ = 0.25 over the entire temperature
interval, which is only an approximation.21 The free Gibbs enthalpy (ΔG) can then be
computed with these values of ΔH and ΔS, resulting in the following values: ΔG = −1.9 kJ/mol at 293.15 K and ΔG =
−2.1 kJ/mol at 323.15 K.

The van’t Hoff plot from Figure 7A has no maximum
on the temperature interval, and the values of ΔH are always positive on this temperature interval used for the retention
study. For example, the values of ΔH are +20.4 kJ/mol at 293.15 K and +1.6 kJ/mol at 323.15 K. In
this case, the values of ΔS are +95.6 J/mol·K
at 293.15 K and +34.4 J/mol·K at 323.25 K.

Different molecular
structures as a function of pH for sildenafil are shown in Figure 8. Two protonated
forms of sildenafil (form 1 and form 2) are present at pH values below
2, and most likely, they exist in mutual equilibrium. However, for
a pH = 2.5, Figure 8 shows a unique dominant molecular species with one positive charge.
Similar to the case of drotaverine, at pH 2.5, multiple types of interactions
are possible with the C18 stationary phase. For the mobile phase water/acetonitrile,
the pH should be around neutral, and several molecular species are
possibly present in the solution. Various species of the same analyte
as well as the potential of multiple interactions in the case of forms
that have a charge may explain the nonlinear van’t Hoff behavior
of the compound seen in Figure 7.

Figure 8 Variation with the pH of different forms of the sildenafil molecule
in an aqueous solution.

For drotaverine and sildenafil at pH = 2.5, the
values of ln k′ have a maximum in the interval
of evaluated temperatures as shown in Figures 4 and 7B, respectively.
Similar to the case of drotaverine (e.g., at pH = 2.5), the curves
describing the variation of ln k′ with 1/T are approximated better when using dependences including
higher terms in 1/T. However, the improvement is
not necessarily significant. For the case of sildenafil separated
without pH control, quadratic approximation gives R2 = 0.9532, cubic approximation gives R2 = 0.9721, quartic approximation gives R2 = 0.9904, and quantic approximation gives R2 = 0.9990. For the curve at pH = 2.5, quadratic approximation
gives R2 = 0.9957, cubic approximation
gives R2 = 0.9977, quartic approximation
gives R2 = 0.9999, and quantic approximation
gives R2 = 1.0000. These results indicate
that, although the quadratic form provides a good approximation for
the variation of ln k′ with temperature, the
quadratic form still remains an approximation, and the consideration
of higher terms in eq 15 still improves the agreement between the experiment and theory.

Examples of van’t Hoff Dependences on HILIC Columns
On HILIC columns, deviations from linear van’t Hoff dependences
are more common.24,25 However, it is difficult to decide
if the deviations from linearity are caused by different forms of
the analyte (producing different interactions26) or it is caused by one form of the analyte subject to different
types of interactions. As an example, the variation of ln k′ with 1/T for histidine separated
on a Gold HILIC 150 × 4.6 mm column with 5 μm particles
with a mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium acetate in water (pH ≈
7.0) at two different aqueous/acetonitrile compositions is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Nonlinear van’t
Hoff dependence in the range of 20 to 50 °C on a HILIC column
for histidine with a mobile phase of an aqueous solution of ammonium
acetate/acetonitrile (pH ≈ 7).

The diagram showing the forms of histidine at different
pH values is given in Figure 10. From Figure 10, it may be concluded that more than one form of the compound is
present in a neutral mobile phase (pH ≈ 7). In such a case,
different forms of the compound associated with different types of
interactions would be the reason for nonlinear dependences between
ln k′ and 1/T during the
chromatographic separation of this compound. Similar to other nonlinear
dependencies, the approximations become slightly better when polynomial
forms with higher powers of 1/T are included. For
example, for glycyl-l-phenylalanine in the 25/75 Aq/AcCN
phase, the R2 values are R2 = 0.9847 for quadratic, R2 = 0.9956 for cubic, R2 = 0.9987 for
quartic, and R2 = 0.9988 for quantic approximation.
The same conclusion in that the addition of higher terms from eq 15 improves the agreement
between the experiment and theory can be obtained here.

forms of histidine as a function of pH.

Nonlinear dependences between ln k′ and 1/T can also be seen for other compounds
such as glycyl-l-phenylalanine (shown in Figure 11) and glycyl-l-tyrosine
(shown in Figure 12). The separations were performed on a Gold HILIC 150 × 4.6
mm column with 5 μm particles with a mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium
acetate in water (pH ≈ 7.0) at two different aqueous/acetonitrile
compositions. For these compounds, the evaluated temperature interval
does not cover a point where ln k′ reaches
an extreme value within the used temperature interval.

Hoff temperature dependence in the range of 20 to 50 °C for the
separation of glycyl-l-phenylalanine on a Gold HILIC 150
× 4.6 mm column with 5 μm particles with a mobile phase
of 10 mM ammonium acetate in water (pH ≈ 7.0).

Figure 12 Plot of van’t Hoff temperature dependence in the
range of 20 to 50 °C for the separation of glycyl-l-tyrosine
on a Gold HILIC 150 × 4.6 mm column with 5 μm particles
with a mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium acetate in water (pH ≈
7.0).

These dependences could be explained by the role
of the adsorbed water molecule from the mobile phase to the stationary
phase27,28 when(i) the temperature increases, and thermal
desorption of the adsorbed mobile phase leads to the formation of
sites at which analyte adsorption is more exergonic owing to the reduced
need to displace molecules from the stationary phase.

(ii) this process can increase the retention
of the analyte, provided that the magnitude of the effect is sufficiently
great.

(iii) the analyte
retention can increase until the thermal desorption of solvent is
near completion.

(iv) beyond
this temperature a decrease in retention is expected with an increase
in temperature.



Conclusions
Linear van’t Hoff dependences were
obtained for compounds with unique structure, such as aromatic hydrocarbons
and esters, which are involved only in hydrophobic interactions with
C18 stationary phases with minor contributions from other potential
types of interactions with the stationary phase (e.g., with residual
silanols). On the contrary, compounds that can potentially participate
in multiple interactions with the stationary phase generate deviations
from van’t Hoff behavior. This was observed, for example, for
drotaverine and sildenafil (as well as other compounds with nonlinear
ln k′ vs 1/T dependencies
reported in the literature) under a reversed-phase mechanism or for
histidine and some dipeptides separated based on HILIC mechanisms.
The quadratic form used to approximate nonlinear van’t Hoff
dependence has been verified in most cases to be very good with only
minor improvement when using higher polynomial dependencies.
