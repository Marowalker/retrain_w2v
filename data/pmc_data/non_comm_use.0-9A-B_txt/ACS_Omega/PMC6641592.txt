Protease activity
is frequently assayed using short peptides that
are equipped with a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
reporter system. Many frequently used donor–acceptor pairs
are excited in the ultraviolet range and suffer from low extinction
coefficients and quantum yields, limiting their usefulness in applications
where a high sensitivity is required. A large number of alternative
chromophores are available that are excited in the visible range,
for example, based on xanthene or cyanine core structures. These alternatives
are not only larger in size but also more hydrophobic. Here, we show
that the hydrophobicity of these chromophores not only affects the
solubility of the resulting FRET-labeled peptides but also their kinetic
parameters in a model enzymatic reaction. In detail, we have compared
two series of 4–8 amino acid long peptides, designed to serve
as substrates for the thermolysin-like protease (TLP-ste) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. These peptides were
equipped with a carboxyfluorescein donor and either Cy5 or its sulfonated
derivative Alexa Fluor 647 as the acceptor. We show that the turnover
rate kcat is largely unaffected by the
choice of the acceptor fluorophore, whereas the KM value is significantly lower for the Cy5- than for the
Alexa Fluor 647-labeled substrates. TLP-ste is a rather nonspecific
protease with a large number of hydrophobic amino acids surrounding
the catalytic site, so that the fluorophore itself may form additional
interactions with the enzyme. This hypothesis is supported by the
result that the difference between Cy5- and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled
substrates becomes less pronounced with increasing peptide length,
that is, when the fluorophore is positioned at a larger distance from
the catalytic site. These results suggest that fluorophores may become
an integral part of FRET-labeled peptide substrates and that KM and kcat values
are generally only valid for a specific combination of the peptide
sequence and FRET pair.

==== Body
Introduction
Fluorescent reporter
systems for the detection of protease activity
consist of a spectroscopic probe with cleavable bonds. Upon cleavage,
the fluorescence properties of the probe are altered, which allows
for following the enzymatic reaction over time.1−8 Three fundamentally different designs are usually utilized for the
detection of protease activity: The first design consists of a fluorophore
core carrying one or multiple peptide chain(s) coupled to the fluorophore
via a peptide bond.3,7−12 Conjugation of the peptide chain(s) causes a change in the photophysical
properties of the fluorophore so that the substrate is essentially
nonfluorescent. The fluorescence is restored upon cleavage and is
directly correlated with the enzyme activity. This design exhibits
some drawbacks however. These substrates are highly artificial, as
the fluorophore replaces the C-terminal part of the substrate (P1′–P4′
subsites, according to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger13). These substrates often carry two enzyme cleavable
bonds,7,8 and the reaction proceeds via an intermediate
with different photophysical properties, so that the reaction velocity
cannot be easily determined.11 The second
design makes use of self-quenching between a large number of fluorophores
coupled to a model protein.5,6 Also in this case, the
substrate is hardly fluorescent, and the fluorescence signal increases
once the peptide fragments are released. This substrate design is
inexpensive, and one can choose from a large number of different fluorophores,
including near-infrared dyes.6 These substrates
contain many cleavage sites, however, leading to multistep reactions
with a distribution of rate constants.14 The third design employs peptides that are equipped with a Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) reporter system. In contrast to the
first design, the peptide sequence is chosen such that it spans the
complete recognition site from the S4 to S4′ subsites. In the
intact peptide substrate, the donor chromophore is coupled at one
terminus and the acceptor chromophore at the other, allowing for efficient
energy transfer.1,2,4,15−20 The fluorophores become separated upon cleavage, leading to an increase
in the donor intensity. Because of the location of the cleavage site,
FRET peptides are more “natural” substrates and can
be utilized for all proteases, independent of the subsite specificity.
More importantly, their 1:1 stoichiometry allows for accessing accurate
kinetic parameters.

FRET-based substrates can be further divided
into two categories:
the acceptor can be “dark”, serving only as a quencher,4,20 or emit fluorescence itself.1,2,15−19 Many donor–acceptor combinations have been reported. The
most commonly used FRET pairs are DABCYL/EDANS4 and Abz/3-nitrotyrosine.21 Substrates
using these dye combinations are easy to synthesize as the dyes can
be incorporated during the solid-phase synthesis of the peptide; however,
their photophysical properties (ultraviolet excitation and low quantum
yield) limit their assay sensitivity. Alternatively, pairs of fluorescent
proteins, such as CFP/YFP,15−17 can be used as FRET pairs. The
problem with this strategy is that fluorescent proteins are bulky,
potentially leading to steric hindrance upon substrate binding to
the enzyme active site. Organic fluorophores that are excited in the
visible range are a versatile alternative.18,19 The large number of possible fluorophore combinations ensures that
a well-suited FRET pair can be identified for the desired application.

Independent of the choice of fluorophores, designing a FRET-based
substrate requires careful consideration of additional parameters
such as the amino acid sequence and the peptide length. The amino
acid sequence directly determines the substrate specificity as well
as the hydrophobicity of the peptide. The peptide length might influence
the FRET efficiency and the kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reaction.
Here, we describe a systematic investigation of the influence of the
peptide length on the fluorescent properties of the substrate and
on the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction. As a model system to evaluate
the performance of the newly designed protease substrates, we have
chosen the thermolysin-like metalloprotease (TLP-ste) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, which is a protease
with a broad specificity profile. To obtain accurate kinetic parameters,
the data are corrected for the inner filter effect (IFE) and compared
to data where no correction has been performed. The use of two different
FRET pairs (carboxyfluorescein/Cy5 and carboxyfluorescein/Alexa Fluor
647) allows for establishing general trends and for identifying specific
contributions of the fluorophore molecules, for example, on substrate
solubility and catalytic efficiency.

Results
Substrate Design
To accurately measure the activity
of TLP-ste, the first step was to design a peptide substrate functionalized
with a donor–acceptor pair that is efficiently hydrolyzed by
the enzyme and possesses appropriate photophysical properties. For
choosing the core peptide sequence, the specificity matrix of the
MEROPS peptidase database22 was utilized.
We hypothesized that the specificity matrix for the homologous enzyme
thermolysin23−25 would also apply for TLP-ste, as thermolysin and
TLP-ste have both shown catalytic activity for similar peptide substrates.26,27 The matrix shows the most preferred amino acids for each subsite
(P4 to P4′, fitting into the S4 to S4′ subsites of the
enzyme active site, according to the nomenclature of Schechter and
Berger,13 see Figure 1).

Figure 1 General structure of the FRET-labeled peptide
substrates, including
the FRET pairs used. An 8-amino acid-long peptide (residues P4 to
P4′) binds into the S4 to S4′ subsites of the enzyme
active site. The donor fluorophore 5,6-carboxyfluorescein [CF; N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS)-ester] was coupled to the primary amine at the N-terminus. The
acceptor fluorophores, Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) or Cy5, were coupled
to a C-terminal cysteine utilizing maleimide-functionalized fluorophore
derivatives. The image shows the reactive form of the fluorophores
at the top. The bonds formed upon coupling are depicted together with
the peptide at the bottom. The image further shows the calculated
octanol–water partition coefficients (clog P) for each fluorophore without and with the linker (values in brackets).
CF does not contain any linker.

Using the best-scoring amino acids, the ideal sequence becomes
AVAGLAGG (from P4 to P4′), with the
scissile bond positioned between glycine and leucine (underlined).
To increase the hydrophilicity of the peptide, the P4 alanine was
replaced by serine. One additional amino acid was added at each terminus
for coupling the donor and acceptor fluorophores, namely a proline
at the N-terminus and a cysteine at the C-terminus. The donor was
coupled to the N-terminal amino group of the proline using an NHS-activated
fluorophore. The acceptor was coupled to the thiol group of the cysteine
via thiol–maleimide conjugation (see Figure 1 and Table 1). In addition to the peptide spanning the whole recognition
site (8aa), two shorter peptides (6aa and 4aa) were also synthesized
(Table 1).

The fluorophores, forming
the FRET pair, were chosen based on the
following criteria: (i) both the donor and acceptor possess a high
brightness and a reasonably good photostability; (ii) the photophysical
properties ensure sufficient spectral overlap and consequently a sufficient
FRET efficiency; (iii) spectral crosstalk is minimal; and (iv) the
two dyes have a different core structure to prevent aggregation and
stacking. Considering these criteria, the xanthene dye CF (maxima
at λex = 493 nm and
λem = 517 nm) was chosen as the donor and a cyanine-based
dye as the acceptor (Figure 1). Because of its good spectral overlap, Cy3 would be a suitable
acceptor. On the other hand, significant spectral crosstalk with the
CF donor is expected. Spectral crosstalk can lead to errors when determining
the FRET efficiency and causes significant background fluorescence
in the enzymatic assay. Alternatively, despite their reduced spectral
overlap, Cy5 (maxima at λex = 648 nm and λem = 662 nm) and its more water-soluble derivative Alexa Fluor
647 (AF647; maxima at λex = 650 nm and λem = 664 nm) were used as the acceptor fluorophore (Figure S1).28 Compared
to Cy5, AF647 is sulfonated at four positions and the linker attachment
site is different (Figure 1). In total, a small library of five different substrates
were synthesized, using different combinations of peptide length and
fluorophore pairs (Table 1).

Substrate Characterization
Prior
to determining the
FRET efficiency, the solubility of the substrates was tested. As shown
in Table 1, a relatively
high hydrophobicity was calculated for the shorter peptides (4aa and
6aa). Coupling the hydrophobic fluorophore Cy5 to these peptides increases
their hydrophobicity even further. To obtain information about the
maximum solubility of the Cy5-labeled substrates in comparison to
the AF647-labeled substrates, a dilution series (1–10 μM)
was prepared, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at the donor
wavelength, which was also used for monitoring product formation.
Provided that the substrate peptides are fully soluble, a linear relationship
is expected between the fluorescence intensity and the peptide concentration.
Whereas the AF647-labeled peptides show a linear relationship up to
a concentration of 8 μM, deviations were already observed at
concentrations of 5 μM for the Cy5-labeled substrates (Figure S2). It has been shown earlier that Cy5
possesses a strong aggregation tendency, for example, forming H-aggregates
that are characterized by different spectroscopic properties.20,28 In the case of our Cy5-labeled peptides, the typical spectral features
of H-aggregate formation are absent however, suggesting that aggregation
is mostly driven by the peptide sequence and the overall hydrophobicity
of the fluorophore-labeled peptides. Clearly, the combination of the
peptide sequence with the hydrophobicity of Cy5 has a detrimental
effect on peptide solubility, limiting the usable concentrations to
the low micromolar range. In the following experiments, no concentrations
above 5 μM were used for the Cy5-labeled substrates.

The
FRET efficiency E, which quantifies the energy transfer
from the donor to the acceptor, is expressed as follows 1  where R0 is the
Förster radius of the FRET pair and r is the
D–A (donor–acceptor) distance. Energy transfer is the
highest when r ≪ R0 and E approaches 1. For protease assays, high FRET
efficiencies close to 1 are desirable, as this allows for a straightforward
quantification of the enzymatic reaction simply based on the increase
in the donor intensity. Two different measurements were performed
to determine E for the different FRET peptides based
on the donor fluorescence intensity I and the donor
fluorescence lifetime τ. Then, E can also be
expressed as 2  

For both measurements,
the respective quantity was determined for
the intact peptide (D–A) as well as for the fully cleaved peptide
(D) and used to calculate E (Table 2). All EI values are close to 1 and vary only in the second digit. This
is expected as the length of the fully extended peptide is well below
the Förster radius (see Table 1 and the Supporting Information). Even though the differences in EI are small, a correlation with the peptide length
is still observed. EI is slightly higher for the shorter peptides (except 4aa-Cy5, which
is the least soluble peptide). This is also confirmed in the Eτ measurements, even though the FRET efficiencies
are different between both types of measurements.

In general, the lifetime-based
method is expected to be more accurate
for determining the FRET efficiencies. Using the fluorescence lifetimes,
the source of the emitted photons can be identified. Consequently,
only photons that originate from the donor and acceptor labeled molecules
are considered for the calculation of the FRET efficiency. In the
presented data, however, the FRET efficiencies could not be accurately
determined from the lifetime-based measurement. For FRET efficiencies E > 90%, the lifetime of the donor is extremely short
so
that donor photons are emitted shortly after the excitation pulse.
Their arrival time partially lies within the response time of the
detector and might overlap with the scattered photons. In this context,
an accurate fitting of the photon arrival time histogram was not possible
(see the Supporting Information for a more
detailed description of the lifetime experiment). In this context,
no meaningful information about the FRET efficiency could be extracted
from the Eτ measurements, even though
the general trends are consistent with the intensity-based measurement.
Overall, we conclude that all FRET-based substrates are functional
and that the FRET efficiency is E > 95% (except
4aa-Cy5).
This is a good starting point for the kinetic measurements where the
increase in the donor signal is monitored.

Kinetic Measurements
To test which substrate design
yields the best probe for measuring the protease activity, the five
substrates were used in kinetic measurements using TLP-ste. In a first
series of experiments, TLP-ste was added to the different substrate
solutions, and both donor and acceptor intensities were followed as
a function of time. Figure 2 shows the result obtained for the substrate 4aa-AF647 as
an example. At t = 0 min, most of
the emitted photons originated from the acceptor (λem = 660 nm). As the reaction proceeded, the intensity of the
acceptor decreased while the donor intensity increased. When following
the enzymatic progress curve at the donor and acceptor wavelengths,
a typical saturation curve was obtained. This clearly indicates that
the substrate is enzymatically cleaved, validating the choice of the
amino acid sequence. Additional proof for the specificity of the reaction
was obtained from two experiments where the substrate was either incubated
in pure buffer or with an inactive enzyme [preincubated with the inhibitor
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)]. In both cases, no or only
a very small increase in donor fluorescence was observed (Figures S4 and S5).

the enzymatic reaction, following both donor (λex = 450 nm and λem = 520 nm) and acceptor emission
(λex = 450 nm and λem = 660 nm).

The next step was to determine
the kinetic constants, KM and vmax, as described by
the Michaelis–Menten equation 3  where v is the reaction velocity, vmax is the maximum velocity, [S] is the substrate
concentration, and KM is the Michaelis–Menten
constant. The reaction velocity, which was obtained from the initial
slope of the donor progress curve, describes the increase in the product
concentration over time. To obtain the product concentration, a calibration
curve is required that relates the measured fluorescence intensity
of the donor to the concentration of the respective donor-carrying
product. When using FRET-based substrates, two complications arise
when determining the calibration factor. As the FRET efficiency is
not 100%, the donor signal will not increase from 0 to 100% upon cleavage,
as it is usually assumed when preparing the calibration curve. Instead,
the donor intensity will only increase from 5 to 100% (assuming a
FRET efficiency of 95%). It is consequently required to correct the
calibration factor by the FRET efficiency. In addition to the FRET
efficiency, also the so-called IFE needs to be considered for an accurate
calibration.29−31 The high substrate concentrations, required for the
kinetic measurements, result in a large number of absorbing chromophores
in solution. This might cause inhomogeneities in the excitation intensity
throughout the sample so that not all fluorophores are excited. Further,
some of the emitted light might be reabsorbed by the surrounding chromophores
(donor and/or acceptor) so that it cannot reach the detector. As a
consequence, the apparent fluorescence intensity is diminished, leading
to a nonlinear relationship between the product concentration and
the fluorescence signal and, ultimately, to an underestimation of
the real enzymatic rate. To correct for the IFE in the kinetic data,
the measured fluorescence intensities Fmeas need to be multiplied with a correction factor CFIFE (see
the Supporting Information for the experimentally
derived correction factors; text and Figure S6). The results of the kinetic analysis after employing corrections
for the FRET efficiency and the IFE are summarized in Table 3. For comparison, the kinetic
constants obtained without applying the correction(s) are shown in Table S3. Representative Michaelis–Menten
and Eadie–Hofstee plots utilizing both corrections are also
shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S7).

As expected
for substrates with a FRET efficiency close to 1, the
FRET efficiency correction has only a minor effect on KM and vmax. A much larger
effect is observed for the IFE correction (Table S3). Palmier et al.31 reported that
the IFE cannot be ignored when the sum of the absorbance values at
the donor excitation (A490nm) and emission
wavelengths (A520nm) exceeds 0.08, that
is, CFIFE > 1.1, disregarding the path length. In our
experiments,
we observe the largest effect of the IFE correction for the substrates
with the highest KM (4aa-AF647 and 8aa-AF647).
For these substrates, the IFE affects the measured reaction velocities
already at substrate concentrations far below KM so that the correction has a larger effect on the overall
shape of the Michaelis–Menten curve and the resulting kinetic
parameters. Interestingly, the IFE correction has only a minor effect
on the kcat/KM values, which describe the initial phase of the reaction where the
product concentration is still low. In the following, we will only
discuss the values obtained when applying both the correction factors.

For all substrates, the obtained KM values lie above the highest concentrations used for the kinetic
measurements (with the exception of 4aa-Cy5). As a consequence, the KM and kcat values
are considered to have a relatively large error. We are still reporting KM and kcat, as several
important trends can be observed for the different substrates. We
have also determined KM and kcat independently from Eadie–Hofstee plots (Figure S7 and Table S4) and observe a reasonable agreement between the two different fitting
methods. In addition, the kcat/KM values were calculated from KM and kcat and obtained directly
from the initial slope of the Michaelis–Menten graph. Both
values show good agreement (Table S5).

When comparing kcat for the different
substrates, little difference is observed for the corresponding Cy5-
and AF647-labeled substrates (less than factor 2), suggesting that
the choice of the fluorophore does not influence the rate of the catalytic
reaction itself. By contrast, the peptide length has a strong effect
on kcat: the longer the substrate, the
higher the kcat (21-fold from 4aa-Cy5
to 8aa-Cy5 and 8-fold from 4aa-AF647 to 8aa-AF647). The KM values are affected by both the peptide length and the
choice of the fluorophore. Much lower KM values are observed for the Cy5-labeled peptides (22-fold for 4aa
and 4-fold for 8aa), suggesting that the Cy5-based substrates bind
stronger into the enzyme active site. KM increases with the peptide length, showing a 7-fold increase for
the Cy5 substrates and a 1.5-fold increase for the AF647 substrates.
The higher KM values observed for longer
peptides are surprising. One would intuitively expect that a longer
recognition sequence would enhance the affinity and thus lower the KM. Overall, the effect on KM is stronger for the Cy5-labeled peptides, suggesting
that the fluorophores themselves contribute to the interaction between
the substrate and the enzyme active site. Alternatively, rebinding
of product molecules into the active site is another possible explanation
for the higher KM of the longer substrates.
If product molecules were able to rebind to the active site, they
would have to be considered as competitive inhibitors so that only
apparent KM values can be determined.

Product Inhibition
The Gly–Leu bond underlined
in Table 1 is the most
probable cleavage site. As TLP-ste is a relatively nonspecific protease,
however, it cannot be excluded that the enzyme is able to cleave the
substrate peptides at different positions. If this were the case,
rebinding (eventually followed by proteolytic cleavage) would be a
lot more likely for the longer substrates (6aa-Cy5, 8aa-Cy5, and 8aa-AF647),
and it would explain the higher KM observed
for these substrates. Using the 8aa-Cy5 and 8aa-AF647 substrates and
their corresponding products, we investigated the extent of rebinding
(product inhibition) by measuring the enzyme activity in the presence
of increasing product concentrations (Figure 3). As the addition of the donor-carrying
product would cause a very high initial fluorescence intensity and
would impair the detection of product formation in the first minutes
of the kinetic measurement, only the acceptor-carrying product H-LAGGC(AF647)-NH2 was used. For practical reasons, the AF647-carrying product
was used for assaying both the AF647 and Cy5 substrates. The absence
of the donor-carrying product in the assay misrepresents the real
situation of a kinetic measurement, however. Consequently, we also
measured the product inhibition using a mixture of the unlabeled products
(acetyl-PSVAG-OH and H-LAGGC-NH2). The extent of inhibition
was estimated using the relative fraction of enzyme activity (activity
in the absence of the product divided by the activity in the presence
of the product).

Figure 3 Activity measurements performed in the presence of different
concentrations
of the product. (a) Measurement performed in the presence of the acceptor-labeled
C-terminal product H-LAGGC(AF647)-NH2. (b) Measurement
performed in the presence of the nonfluorescent N- and C-terminal
products, acetyl-PSVAG-OH and H-LAGGC-NH2. All measurements
were performed in triplicate. The values represent the mean ±
the standard deviation.

Figure 3a
shows
that the relative activity decreases as the concentration of acceptor-carrying
product increases, suggesting that product inhibition takes place.
This effect is not observed, however, when performing the measurement
with the nonfluorescent products (Figure 3b). The decrease in the relative activity
observed for the AF647-carrying product (Figure 3a) might be due to the IFE or intermolecular
FRET, as a significant number of chromophores has been added to the
solution. Considering the data from both measurements and their corresponding
error, it can be concluded that product inhibition does not have a
strong effect on the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the higher KM observed for longer substrates cannot be explained
by product inhibition. This indirectly supports our alternative hypothesis
that the acceptor fluorophore contributes to substrate binding into
the active site, thereby affecting the KM value of the enzymatic reaction.

Discussion
The
aim of this study was to investigate the importance of the
peptide length and fluorophore choice as design parameters for the
development of FRET-based substrates for protease assays. The peptide
length is expected to affect many substrate characteristics simultaneously,
such as the FRET efficiency, substrate solubility, binding affinity,
and catalytic rate as well as possible product inhibition and enzyme–fluorophore
interactions. Indeed, our results show that all of these characteristics
are affected, some in opposing ways. For example, when increasing
the peptide length, the FRET efficiency decreases slightly, whereas
the solubility increases. These effects are small, however, when compared
to the influence of the peptide length on the kinetic constants and
on the enzyme–fluorophore interactions.

For both the
CF/Cy5 and CF/AF647 series, an increase in kcat was observed when extending the length of
the peptide. A similar length dependence was also observed for the
serine protease chymotrypsin and was explained with a dynamic coupling
between subsite interactions and catalysis.32 Even though the catalytic mechanisms of TLP-ste and chymotrypsin
are different, the substrate binding site(s) seems to cooperatively
communicate with the active site in both cases. When comparing the kcat values measured here (0.37–7.8 s–1) with other results obtained for TLP-ste or thermolysin,
previously reported values appear to be higher (2–5200
s–1).27,33−36 Most substrates characterized earlier span maximally
the S2–S2′ subsites.33,34,36 Considering the observed length dependence, even
higher kcat values may therefore be expected
for the longer substrates reported here. A direct extrapolation is
difficult, however. The previously reported substrates possess different
peptide sequences and/or fluorescent reporter systems with unknown
cooperativity effects.33,34,36

Although increasing peptide length has a positive effect on kcat, the opposite is the case for KM. Assuming that KM reflects
the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate, the enzyme–substrate
interaction seems to become weaker with increasing peptide length.
This result is not only unexpected but also in contrast with the results
obtained for chymotrypsin, where KM tends
to decrease with increasing peptide length.32 As our control experiments do not show any evidence for product
inhibition, we conclude that the fluorophore itself contributes to
this effect. As a direct result of its sulfonation, AF647 is less
hydrophobic and bulkier than Cy5 (Figure 1). When inspecting the geometry of the thermolysin
substrate binding site, a 4 nm-long cleft is observed (Figure S8). This cleft can accommodate at least
five N-terminal and C-terminal amino acids from the cleavage site.
For the shorter substrates, it is therefore likely that the fluorophores
interact with this substrate binding cleft. The S1′–S4′
subsites contain a large number of hydrophobic amino acids, which
may contribute to the increased affinity for Cy5 over AF647. Even
though the AF647-labeled substrates possess a higher KM than the Cy5-labeled substrates, the measured values
are still lower than most KM values reported
in the literature.27,33−35 The only other
substrate that shows a KM value lower
than 100 μM is the 4-amino-acid long sequence GlyPheLeuAla,
which carries the fluorophores dabsyl and bimane as a FRET pair.36 Interestingly, this sequence also possesses
a kcat similar to the values measured
here.

Our results suggest that both the peptide length and the
nature
of the acceptor fluorophore determine the kinetic constants of the
enzymatic reaction. The peptide length has a direct effect on kcat and KM. The
peptide length further influences KM indirectly,
positioning the acceptor fluorophore relative to the binding cleft
and thereby modulating its interaction with the enzyme. kcat and KM affect the catalytic
efficiency kcat/KM in opposite directions; however, the increase in kcat overcompensates the negative effect on KM so that an overall increase in the catalytic
efficiency is observed with increasing peptide length. The kcat/KM values lie
in the range from 104 to 106 M–1 s–1, which are in the range of previously reported
values for enzymes from the thermolysin family.27,33−36 The clear influence of the fluorophore on KM argues that the catalytic efficiency could be increased further
when using more hydrophobic amino acids in the corresponding subsites.
As this would have a negative effect on substrate solubility, however,
this would have to be compensated for in other subsites. Considering
that little information is available on possible cooperative effects
between subsites, this goal may be difficult to achieve with a rational
approach. A combinatorial library, using the consensus sequence as
a starting point, may be a promising strategy toward better performing
sequences.

It appears likely that the fluorophore itself causes
the difference
in the KM values; however, the linker
between the fluorophore and the reactive maleimide functionality cannot
be ignored. The linkers attached to Cy5 and AF647 are identical, but
they are coupled to the fluorophore at different positions (Figure 1). They may therefore
orient the fluorophores differently with respect to the hydrophobic
binding site. Also, the linkers themselves contain a hydrophobic hydrocarbon
chain, which may further influence the interaction between the fluorophore
and the enzyme. Most likely, the combination of the linker and the
fluorophore contributes to favorable or unfavorable enzyme–substrate
interactions, thereby increasing or decreasing the KM value. We argue that such contributions from fluorophores
and/or linkers will be generally observed also for other fluorophores
and proteases and are not necessarily restricted to hydrophobic interactions.
Different kinetic constants have, for example, also been determined
for α-chymotrypsin when measured with succinyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide32 and succinyl-AAPF-morpholinecarbonyl-rhodamine110.11 In addition, many fluorophores have been shown
to interact nonspecifically with DNA,37 polypeptides,38 and lipid membranes,39 suggesting that such interactions frequently
occur for many different biological systems. To obtain a better, structure-based
understanding of (nonspecific) enzyme–fluorophore interactions,
modeling combined with molecular dynamics simulations may be the method
of choice. Simulations of FRET-labeled proteins are now frequently
employed to establish the conformational space of the attached fluorophores
and to accurately determine molecular distances.38,40 These methods may also be suited to obtain detailed structural insights
into possible linker orientations and enzyme–fluorophore interactions.

Overall, our results suggest that long peptides spanning all S4–S4′
subsites should be preferred, even for rather nonspecific proteases,
such as those from the thermolysin family. This not only increases
the catalytic efficiency but also provides more possibilities for
tuning the hydrophilicity of the peptide sequence. Most importantly,
it will allow for reducing possible enzyme–fluorophore interactions,
as the distance between the fluorophore and the catalytic site increases.
In cases where this is not possible, for example, when the product
rebinds to the enzyme as an inhibitor or substrate, the influence
of fluorophores and linkers needs to be considered and should ideally
be tested in a control experiment. In this control experiment, a different
fluorophore can be used, as shown here, or the position of the donor
and acceptor can simply be exchanged on the same peptide sequence.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that peptides labeled with a carboxyfluorescein
donor and a Cy5 or Alexa Fluor 647 acceptor can serve as powerful
enzyme substrates for in vitro kinetic measurements of the protease
TLP-ste. Coupling these FRET pairs to the consensus recognition sequence
yields useful enzyme substrates that allow for determining the kinetic
constants of the enzymatic reaction. Our results suggest that the
fluorophore and its linker become integral parts of the substrate
molecule, contributing to the enzyme–substrate interaction.
The possibility of enzyme–fluorophore interactions needs to
be considered when kinetic constants are to be obtained. Protease
substrates that use bright organic fluorophores as FRET pairs may
find use in applications where a high sensitivity is required, for
example, in miniaturized and parallelized assays for specificity profiling,
inhibitor screening, enzyme optimization, diagnostics,19,41−44 and eventually for single molecule enzymology.45,46 Using a near-infrared emitting acceptor will further allow for using
the substrates in cell-based or in vivo studies, for example, when
fusing the substrate to a cell-penetrating peptide.47,48

Experimental
Procedures
Materials
The FRET-labeled peptides
were synthesized
by JPT Peptide Technologies (Berlin, Germany). Following solid-phase
synthesis of the peptides, the donor fluorophore CF was coupled to
the N-terminal amine of the proline residue via NHS-ester chemistry.
The acceptor fluorophores Cy5 or Alexa Fluor 647 were coupled to the
C-terminal cysteine using maleimide-activated fluorophores. The high-performance
liquid chromatography-purified and freeze-dried substrate peptides,
containing acetate as the counterion, were dissolved in a concentration
of 2 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored in aliquots at −20
°C. The enzyme TLP-ste (C288L/N181C) was expressed and purified
as described.49 Assayed with N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Gly-Leu amide, this enzyme preparation possesses
a KM value of 7 mM and a kcat value of 14 s–1.

Determination
of the FRET Efficiency
The FRET efficiency
was determined from the fluorescence intensities and lifetimes of
the intact substrates (donor fluorescence in the presence of the acceptor)
and the cleaved substrates (donor fluorescence in the absence of the
acceptor). The substrate stock solutions were diluted to 1 μM
in MOPS buffer (20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 5 mM CaCl2) with 10%
DMSO. The cleaved substrates were prepared by adding 1 nM TLP-ste
to the substrate solutions. These samples were incubated at room temperature
in the dark for at least 16 h to ensure complete hydrolysis. For the
intensity-based measurement, the fluorescence intensity of each sample
was measured (λex = 450 nm and λem = 520 nm) with a microplate reader (Infinite 200 Pro, Tecan) using
black, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner). For the lifetime-based
measurement, the substrate solutions were analyzed using a confocal
microscope equipped with a pulsed 485 nm laser and an avalanche photodiode
detector to allow for time-correlated single photon counting (see
the Supporting Information).

Kinetic Measurements
The kinetic measurements were
performed in a microplate reader. The substrates were diluted in MOPS
buffer ensuring a final concentration of 10% DMSO in all samples.
The substrate concentrations covered a range between 0 and 5 μM
for the Cy5-based substrates and between 0 and 8 μM for the
AF647-based substrates. One nanomolar concentration of the enzyme
TLP-ste was used. The measurement was started by adding 10 μL
of enzyme to 190 μL of the substrate solution. Product formation
was monitored at the donor wavelength (λex = 490
nm and λem = 520 nm). The reaction was followed for
1 h (90 s intervals between two data points) at a temperature of 30
°C.

The fluorescence intensity was converted into product
concentration using a calibration curve. The calibration curve was
determined using the donor-carrying product (CF-PSVAG-NH2). The product was diluted in MOPS buffer with 10% DMSO, covering
a concentration range from 0 to 4 μM. The corresponding fluorescence
intensity values were measured with the microplate reader using exactly
the same settings as for the kinetic measurements. The data were fitted
to a straight line in the concentration range from 0 to 2 μM
(8 data points). The conversion factor used for all kinetic measurements
represents the mean of four independent measurements.

All kinetic
measurements were performed in triplicate, and the
data were analyzed in the following way: The slope of the initial
linear part of the kinetic curve was determined using least-squares
fitting in OriginLab 8.6. When desired, the slope was corrected for
the FRET efficiency (division of the slope by the FRET efficiency)
and/or for the IFE (multiplication of the slope by the IFE correction
factor). The slope was then converted into the reaction velocity (μM
of product per second) using the previously determined calibration
factor. The data derived from each experiment were plotted in the
Michaelis–Menten and Eadie–Hofstee form. These plots
were fitted to obtain the KM and vmax values. Subsequently, the mean values and
standard deviations were calculated. kcat was calculated by dividing vmax by the
enzyme concentration. kcat/KM was calculated from the obtained kcat and KM values. It was confirmed
by calculating the slope of the linear part of the Michaelis–Menten
plot (when [S] ≪ KM). A comparison of the kcat/KM values is shown in the Supporting Information (Table S5).

Product Inhibition
Peptides representing both the N-terminal
(acetyl-PSVAG-OH, acetylated N-terminus, and free C-terminus) and
C-terminal (H-LAGGC-NH2, free N-terminus, and amidated
C-terminus) reaction products of the 8aa substrates were used to test
for product inhibition. The kinetic measurements were performed with
substrate concentrations ranging between 0 and 2 μM, to which
different concentrations of the product (0–20 μM) were
added. In one series of measurements, the nonfluorescent products
(acetyl-PSVAG-OH and H-LAGGC-NH2) were added. The measurement
was repeated using only the acceptor-bearing C-terminal product H-LAGGC(AF647)-NH2. The donor-carrying N-terminal product was not used, as it
would cause a very strong background fluorescence, preventing the
detection of enzyme activity. The extent of product inhibition was
estimated by comparing the
reaction velocity in the absence and presence of the product. Each
measurement was performed in triplicate.
