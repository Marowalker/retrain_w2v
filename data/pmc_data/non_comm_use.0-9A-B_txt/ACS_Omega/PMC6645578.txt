The aromatic amino acids, Tyr or
Trp, which line the active-site
walls of esterases, stabilize the catalytic His loop via hydrogen
bonding. A Tyr residue is preferred in extremophilic esterases (psychrophilic
or hyperthermophilic esterases), whereas a Trp residue is preferred
in moderate-temperature esterases. Here, we provide evidence that
Tyr and Trp play distinct roles in cold adaptation of the psychrophilic
esterase EstSP1 isolated from an Arctic bacterium Sphingomonas
glacialis PAMC 26605. Stern–Volmer plots showed
that the mutation of Tyr191 to Ala, Phe, Trp, and His resulted in
reduced conformational flexibility of the overall protein structure.
Interestingly, the Y191W and Y191H mutants showed increased thermal
stability at moderate temperatures. All Tyr191 mutants showed reduced
catalytic activity relative to wild-type EstSP1. Our results indicate
that Tyr with its phenyl hydroxyl group is favored for increased conformational
flexibility and high catalytic activity of EstSP1 at low temperatures
at the expense of thermal stability. The results of this study suggest
that, in the permanently cold Arctic zone, enzyme activity has been
selected for psychrophilic enzymes over thermal stability. The results
presented herein provide novel insight into the roles of Tyr and Trp
residues for temperature adaptation of enzymes that function at low,
moderate, and high temperatures.

Introduction
Enzymes
from psychrophiles display high catalytic activity at low
temperatures when compared to homologous enzymes from mesophiles and
thermophiles.1,2 For cold-adapted enzymes, the
challenge is to ensure adequate molecular movement required for catalysis
at low temperatures via the acquisition of flexible structure, particularly
near the active site.2−5 Regions distal to the active site have been shown to influence enzyme
catalysis.6−8 Structural adaptations include reduced intramolecular
interactions, loop extension, and increased active-site accessibility.9−11 The psychrophilic nature of an enzyme can also be strongly influenced
by minor variations in amino acids.12 Cold-adapted
enzymes generally exhibit increased glycine content, but reduced arginine,
proline, and acidic amino acid contents.13,14 Accompanying kinetic adaptations include reduced Gibbs free energy
of activation (ΔG‡), low
enthalpy (ΔH), and reduced substrate-binding
affinity;10 however, these characteristics
are not universal for all cold-adapted enzymes.15 As a result of these adaptations, the enzymes become heat-labile
at moderate temperatures.

Despite being more flexible than other
parts of the enzyme, the
active site of cold-adapted enzymes should maintain the correct conformation
and orientation of catalytic residues.16 Discrete adjustments of amino acid residues in the catalytic site
wall are also responsible for adaptation of proteins to low or high
temperature.17 Esterases are hydrolase
enzymes that prefer shorter-chain esters of less than 10 carbons,
and their catalytic residues are generally Ser, His, and Asp residues.18 Previous studies have shown that the aromatic
amino acid residues, Trp or Tyr, line the active-site walls of cold-adapted,
mesophilic, and hyperthermophilic esterases, playing an important
role in stabilization of the catalytic His loop via hydrogen bonding
as well as maintenance of their catalytic activity at each working
temperature.19−22 Multiple sequence alignment showed that Trp is highly conserved
in moderate-temperature esterases (psychrotrophic or mesophilic esterases),
whereas Tyr is preferred in the corresponding position of hyperthermophilic
esterases and some mesophilic esterases (Figure 1a, upper panel). Boyineni et al. showed that
Trp208 of a psychrotrophic esterase, EstK, is responsible for most
of the Trp fluorescence generated by the five Trp residues in EstK,
suggesting a hydrophobic environment of the Trp208 residue.19 The mutation of Trp208 to Tyr in EstK showed
12-fold increased catalytic efficiency at 40 °C, as well as increased
catalytic site thermal stability via a strengthened hydrogen bond
to Asp308, whereas the other parts of the enzyme were denatured at
elevated temperatures.19 Similarly, the
mutation of Trp187 to Tyr in a mesophilic esterase, rPPE, was shown
to increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.20 Conversely, the mutation of Trp187 to His in rPPE has been
shown to induce structural rearrangements, such as relocation of Asp287
(equivalent to Asp308 in EstK) and spatial adjustment for substrate
binding, resulting in improved catalytic efficiency.20,21 However, the mutation of Tyr182 to a bulky Trp in a hyperthermophilic
esterase, EstE1, caused detrimental effects on catalytic activity
and thermal stability of the enzyme.22 Additionally,
the mutation of Tyr182 to a similar-sized Phe had little effect on
EstE1 thermal stability, indicating that the hydrogen bond involving
Tyr182 is critical for stabilization of the catalytic His loop but
not for thermal stability of the enzyme, as the overall structure
of EstE1 was already adapted to high temperatures.22

containing the catalytic residues His284 and Asp254 is shown stabilized
by the hydrogen bond of Tyr191 with Ile287.

Interestingly, there was an unusual presence of Tyr at the
corresponding
position of psychrophilic esterases, including EstSP1 (S. glacialis PAMC 26605),30 EstS (S. halifaxensis),31 and EstG (Sphingobium sp.)32 (Figure 1a, lower panel). The 314-amino acid EstSP1
originating from the Arctic bacterium S. glacialis PAMC 26605 has an α/β hydrolase structure and a catalytic
triad that consists of Ser162, Asp254, and His284 residues.30 EstSP1 showed substrate preference for esters
of short-chain fatty acid as well as dialkyl phthalates (C2–C6).30 We hypothesized that Tyr191 located in the active-site
wall of EstSP1 plays a distinct role in the cold adaptation of the
enzyme. The structural model of EstSP1 based on the crystal structure
of a mesophilic esterase Est8 (PDB ID: 4YPV)26 indicated
that Tyr191 stabilizes the catalytic His loop in EstSP1 via a hydrogen
bond with Ile287 (Figure 1b), similar to the mechanism of active-site stabilization
previously shown for EstK, rPPE, and EstE1.16,19−22 We utilized site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutations of Tyr191
to form aromatic amino acids with different characteristics (Phe and
Trp), as well as a small aliphatic amino acid (Ala) and a charged
amino acid (His). Although His is a basic amino acid, the imidazole
group of His has an aromatic characteristic at all pH values.33 Here, we provide evidence that a subtle adjustment
of Tyr or Trp in the active-site wall of esterase controls the level
of activity and thermal stability in a reciprocal manner; hence, Tyr
is preferred for its high catalytic activity of EstSP1 at permanently
cold environments of the Arctic zone at the expense of thermal stability,
whereas Trp is preferred for maintenance of thermal stability at the
expense of catalytic activity. This study provides a striking example
of the structural basis of protein evolution and adaptation to a permanently
cold environment.

Results
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
and Protein Expression
To
elucidate the role of Tyr191 lining the active-site wall of EstSP1
in cold adaptation, EstSP1 mutants were constructed by site-directed
mutagenesis using the estSP1 gene as a template,
including aliphatic amino acid Ala (Y191A), aromatic amino acids Phe
and Trp (Y191F and Y191W), or charged amino acid His (Y191H). The
wild-type (WT) and mutant EstSP1 enzymes with a C-terminal six His-tag
were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21
(DE3) as soluble proteins and purified using nickel-chelate affinity
chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography to homogeneity. The
mutant proteins appeared on an sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel as
a single band of approximately 35 kDa in size (data not shown), as
previously shown for WT EstSP1.30

Apparent
Optimum Temperature
The apparent optimum activities
of WT and mutant EstSP1 enzymes were measured in the temperature range
of 4–60 °C. The WT showed maximum activity at 40 °C
and pH 8.0 (Figure 2). The Y191A, Y191F, and Y191W mutants showed similar apparent optimum
temperatures to the WT of approximately 40 °C (Figure 2). Surprisingly, Y191H had
a thermophilic characteristic with a shift of apparent optimum temperature
to 90 °C during 3 min of incubation, at which temperature, the
WT lost its activity (Figure 2). However, Y191H showed the lowest enzymatic activity below
40 °C compared to the other mutants (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Apparent optimum temperature of WT and mutant
EstSP1 enzymes. The
optimum temperature was determined from 4 to 80 °C in reaction
buffer D (100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol).
Error bars represent mean ± S.D., and the points represent an
average of at least three independent experiments.

Thermal Stability
To evaluate the
effects of mutations
on the thermal stability of EstSP1, enzymatic activity was measured
at the apparent optimum temperature of WT (40 °C) after incubation
at 4, 25, 40, and 60 °C for the indicated times. The WT started
losing its thermal stability gradually at 25 °C after 20 min
of incubation (Figure 3), and its Tm value was 57.2 °C
(Table 1). In contrast,
Y191A, Y191F, Y191H, and Y191W showed improved thermal stability at
25 °C for 2 h (Figure 3). However, mutants Y191A and Y191F showed reduced thermal
stability relative to the WT at 40 and 60 °C. Interestingly,
Y191H and Y191W were more stable than WT, even at 40 °C. At 60
°C, WT lost almost all of its enzymatic activity after 2 h, but
Y191W maintained more than 20% of its residual activity (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Thermal stabilities of
WT and mutant EstSP1 enzymes. Thermal stability
was measured at the optimum temperature after incubation of enzymes
at 4, 25, 40, and 60 °C for the indicated time. Data are expressed
as the percentage of initial activity remaining after incubation at
the indicated temperatures. The catalytic activity at the optimum
temperature before incubation was considered 100%. Data shown reflect
at least three independent experiments.

Table 1 Melting Temperature (Tm) and T50 Values of WT and
Mutant EstSP1 Enzymes
 	Tm (°C)	T50 (°C)	
WT	57.2 ± 1.9	46.8 ± 0.2	
Y191A	51.6 ± 2.6	34.5 ± 1.5	
Y191F	54.7 ± 4.7	40.8 ± 1.1	
Y191W	57.3 ± 0.3	49.6 ± 0.3	
Y191H	58.2 ± 0.2	49.7 ± 0.2	
Overall, EstSP1 proteins maintained thermal stability in the order
of Y191H > Y191W > WT > Y191F > Y191A (Figure 3 and Table 1). The T50 values
were
in agreement with the thermal stability data (Table 1).

Effects of Mutation on Conformational Flexibility
The
conformational flexibility of WT and mutant EstSP1 enzymes was determined
by acrylamide-induced quenching of Tyr and Trp fluorescence upon excitation
at 280 nm. EstSP1 has three Trp and nine Tyr residues, with the Trp
residues exposed on the surface. The Stern–Volmer plot indicated
that all mutant EstSP1 enzymes exhibit reduced conformational flexibility
of the overall protein structure relative to the WT (Figure 4a). Moreover, small-to-large
mutations Y191H and Y191W resulted in larger conformational changes
than amino acids with aliphatic group, Y191A, and the similar-sized
Y191F. All of the substituted residues (Ala, Phe, Trp, and His) played
a role in maintaining rigid conformations by providing good coverage
and masking to produce hydrophobic pockets,34 as the region was shown to be hydrophobic in EstK.19 The hydropathy index values for the mutated amino acids
support that Ala, Phe, and Trp participate in hydrophobic interactions,
whereas the degree of hydrophobic interaction is less with Tyr because
of its hydroxyl group.35 The results indicate
that the overall effect of the hydrogen bond of Tyr191 is to maintain
conformational flexibility of enzyme catalysis, not to enhance protein
thermal stability.

Figure 4 Conformational flexibility of WT and mutant EstSP1 enzymes.
A Stern–Volmer
plot was generated by recording the maximum fluorescence intensity
in the presence of a range of acrylamide concentrations after excitation
at 280 nm. (a) F0/F values
were plotted against acrylamide concentration. F0, fluorescence intensity without acrylamide; F, fluorescence intensity with 0–0.5 M acrylamide. The curves
are the average of three independent experiments. (b) Stern–Volmer
plot obtained by subtracting the individual temperature variation
in fluorescence quenching between 4 and 30 °C.

To further investigate the structural permeability
of WT and mutants,
dynamic acrylamide quenching was measured as shown in Figure 4b. The difference between quenching
at 4 and 30 °C revealed that WT had a larger conformational change
than all mutants as it has greater accessibility to acrylamide. Conversely,
all mutants showed similar permeabilities at 4 and 30 °C up to
0.3 M acrylamide (Figure 4b). EstSP1 mutants underwent a discrete conformational change
from 0.4 M acrylamide; nevertheless, all mutants exhibited more rigid
overall structure than WT (Figure 4b).

CD Spectroscopy Analysis
To investigate the changes in the secondary
structure of EstSP1, the CD spectra of the WT and mutants were measured
at 4 and 40 °C, respectively (Figure 5). As expected, the WT, Y191H, and Y191W
maintained their secondary structure at 4 and 40 °C. Mutants
Y191A and Y191F showed distinct changes in secondary structure at
40 °C relative to 4 °C, suggesting the conformation changed
at 40 °C, which could be correlated with their loss of stability
at 40 °C relative to the WT (Figure 3).

Figure 5 The CD spectra were measured at 25 °C after
incubating 0.38
mg mL−1 protein sample at 4 and 40 °C for 30
min buffer B (20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 5% glycerol).

Kinetics and Thermodynamic Analysis
The kinetic parameters
of the WT and mutants were determined as shown in Table 2. EstSP1 was found to have a Km value of 92.5 μM and a kcat value of 227 s–1. The Y191F mutant
showed a decrease in kcat value to 119
s–1 and an increase in Km value to 247 μM, demonstrating that not only is the aromatic
ring of Tyr essential but also the formation of a hydrogen bond via
the Tyr phenyl hydroxyl group is critical for its catalytic activity.
To our surprise, the Y191F mutant showed a drastic decrease in catalytic
rate and substrate-binding affinity, resulting in lower catalytic
efficiency (kcat/Km) at 40 °C relative to the WT. The Y191H mutant significantly
decreased substrate-binding affinity (2441 μM), reducing the
catalytic efficiency by 26-fold relative to the WT. All of the mutants
showed significantly reduced substrate affinities as compared to WT,
rendering them less efficient catalysts. Among the mutant enzymes,
Y191F showed the highest catalytic efficiency of 0.48 μM–1 s–1, whereas Y191H showed the lowest
catalytic efficiency value of 0.04 μM–1 s–1.

40	486 ± 31	22 ± 4.2	0.05	68.7	20.2	–48.5	
The WT showed the lowest ΔG‡ values of 59.2 kJ mol–1 at
20 °C and 62.7
kJ mol–1 at 40 °C (Table 2). The low ΔG‡ values of the WT can be attributed to high kcat values of 175 and 227 s–1 at 20 and 40 °C, respectively, which is usual for cold-adapted
enzymes thriving at near-zero temperature. In contrast, the mutants
exhibited lower catalytic rates and higher ΔG‡ values than the WT. However, the thermodynamic
parameters of Y191H could not be determined. The WT and mutants showed
negative TΔS‡ values and exhibited an apparent decrease in conformational disorder
between the ES and ES‡ states at 20 °C. The
change in entropy of the Y191W mutant was significantly larger than
that of the WT, suggesting that Trp does not fit well in the space
designated for the Tyr191 because of its bulkier side chain. In addition,
the lack of a stabilizing hydrogen bond between Tyr191 and Ile287
further adds to disorder around the active site. Conversely, the TΔS‡ values of
Y191A and Y191F were slightly decreased, indicating the compactness
of the catalytic domain as expected for the small hydrophobic side-chain
residues.

Overall, the mutants exhibited an increased enthalpy
of activation
(ΔH‡) relative to the WT,
demonstrating that the mutations induced conformational change at
lower temperature, reducing their catalytic rates.

Y191H Mutant
Although the Y191H mutant showed relatively
higher thermal stability from 70 to 90 °C compared to WT (Figures 2 and 3), the kinetic data demonstrated that the catalytic activity
of Y191H remained much lower than that of WT (Table 2). We speculated that Y191H might have acquired
some additional intramolecular interactions. A structural model of
Y191H based on the crystal structure of Est8 showed the formation
of a salt bridge between His191 and Asp161 (Figure 6a). Moreover, the structural rotation of
His191 in comparison to Tyr191 resulted in relocation of nearby residues,
leading to the formation of a strong hydrophobic core near the catalytic
site in the Y191H mutant. Salt bridges were shown to be the likely
principal stabilizing force enhancing protein thermal stability.36 Furthermore, salt bridges within thermally unstable
regions were found to be relatively stronger and to undergo additional
tightening at high temperatures.37

Figure 6 (a) Detailed
view of salt bridge formation between His191 and Asp161,
which is located next to catalytic residue Ser162 in Y191H mutant.
(b) Temperature-induced unfolding for Y191H was measured upon excitation
at 280 nm after incubation for 6 min at the indicated temperatures.
The change in fluorescence intensities at different temperatures was
shown as the ratio of fluorescence at 4 °C (F0) to fluorescence intensities at increasing temperatures
(F).

To investigate temperature-induced unfolding of the tertiary
structures
of WT and Y191H, fluorescence emission spectra were measured at various
temperatures. The fluorescence emission spectra suggested that Y191H
was resistant to heat and gradually unfolded from 40 to 70 °C
with a constant increase in catalytic efficiency, whereas WT started
unfolding at 40 °C and was approximately 60% unfolded at 70 °C
with a drastic loss of catalytic activity (Figure 6b). Although Y191H exhibited the apparent
maximum enzymatic activity at 90 °C (Figure 2), the overall structure of Y191H was denatured
(Figure 3 and 6b). However, the Y191H mutant showed an increase
in Tm value relative to WT.

Ile287 Mutants
To further elucidate the role of Tyr191,
we mutated the counterpart amino acid Ile287 located at the loop holding
the catalytic His284. Two more mutants, I287A and I287P, were constructed.
The Ile backbone nitrogen atom was involved in the formation of the
hydrogen bond between Tyr191 and Ile287, and the same bond remained
for the I287A mutant (Figure 1b). The overall effect of mutation was more detrimental for
I287P than I287A, with Pro causing major structural disruption. The
optimum temperature of I287A was shown to be 40 °C, similar to
that of WT, whereas I287P showed an optimum temperature range of 30–50
°C (Figure 7a).
To compare their thermal stabilities, the esterase activities of WT
and Ile287 mutants were measured at 40 °C following incubation
at 4, 25, 40, and 60 °C for the indicated times. Mutation of
Ile287 to Ala or Pro resulted in a loss of thermal stability (Figure 7b).

Figure 7 Ile287 mutants. (a) Apparent

experiments. (b) Thermal stability was measured at the optimum temperature

Discussion
The high catalytic activity at low temperatures,
intrinsic flexibility,
and thermal lability represent a central paradigm in cold adaptation
of enzymes.3,38−41S. glacialis PAMC 26605 is a lichen-associated bacterium that thrives in the
permanently cold Arctic zone.42 EstSP1
showed an apparent optimum activity at 40 °C and approximately
25% activity at 4 °C (Figure 2). EstSP1 was comparatively stable at 25 °C or
below, but was quite unstable at temperatures over 40 °C (Figures 2 and 3). These results reflect that EstSP1 evolved to be flexible
and consequently more heat-labile to adapt to the permanently cold
environment it inhabits.

The active-site wall of EstSP1 has
an unusual presence of Tyr at
position 191 (Figure 1a, lower panel), which plays a key role in establishment of its psychrophilic
nature. Particularly, the phenyl hydroxyl group of Tyr191 is essential,
not only for maintenance of proper conformation of the EstSP1 active
site and enabling high catalytic activity, but also for preventing
its structural rigidity. As shown in the Stern–Volmer plots,
the mutation of Tyr191 to Ala, Phe, Trp, and His all led to the formation
of a rigid structure (Figure 4). Moreover, all mutant enzymes showed reduced catalytic rate
(Table 2). The replacement
of Tyr191 with His in our study resulted in high apparent optimum
temperature and increased thermal stability. Dou et al. showed that
the mutation of Trp187 to His in rPPE caused spatial relocation of
the residues,21 but the effect of the mutation
on the flexibility and stability of rPPE is unknown. However, we do
not expect EstSP1 to evolve the additional unnecessary thermal stability
required at high temperatures.

The role of a hydrogen bond in
proteins existing in hydrophobic
environments has been extensively investigated. Interleukin-1β
(IL-1β) is a protein involved in inflammatory process regulation
that has an internal hydrophobic cavity.43 When Tyr157 of chicken IL-1β was mutated to Phe, a corresponding
residue in human IL-1β, the Y157F mutant showed increased thermal
stability with a 10 °C shift in Tm value, suggesting that the amino acid residues present around the
internal hydrophobic cavity play important roles in maintenance of
thermal stability rather than cavity size.43,44 Similarly, Tyr125 near the active site of Aerococcus
viridians lactate oxidase plays a subtle role in maintenance
of the active-site microenvironment best suited for flavin reduction
and oxidation steps.45 Mutation of Tyr125
to Phe (Y125F) resulted in unfavorable participation in enzyme activity
by generating a tighter hydrophobic association with the substrate
and hence slower release of pyruvate.45 However, for esterases, either Tyr or Trp is favored as both residues
can participate in hydrogen bond formation along with their hydrophobic
characteristics.

We previously showed that the active site of
EstK is constrained
via a stability and flexibility trade-off.16 Specifically, the hydrogen bond of Trp208 and Asp308 was crucial
in maintaining the thermal stability of WT EstK, although the mutation
of Asp308 to Ala exhibited enhanced substrate affinity and catalytic
rate via enlargement of the active site.16 Although both Trp and Tyr can participate in hydrogen bond formation,
Trp is more hydrophobic than Tyr and therefore contributes to enhanced
thermal stability, which in turn negatively affects binding specificity
with the substrate. Our results suggest that distinct roles of Tyr
and Trp for catalytic activity and thermal stability are also applied
to other esterases adapted to elevated temperatures. As shown in Table 3 and Figure 8, Tyr is favored for high catalytic
activity of WT EstSP1 (Figure 8a) and WT EstE1 (Figure 8d)22 as well as EstK W208Y19 and rPPE W187Y,20 whereas Trp is favored in WT EstK (Figure 8b)19 and WT rPPE
(Figure 8c).20 Recently, Pereira et al. have characterized
a mesophilic esterase, Est8, having higher catalytic efficiency against
short-chain esters with mild thermal stability.26 Sequence alignment showed the presence of Tyr near the
catalytic site of Est8 (Figure 1a, upper panel), further supporting the idea that the presence
of Tyr can be attributed to high enzymatic activity.44

Nevertheless, compared to our previous studies on
EstK and EstE1,16,19,22 we found that EstSP1 has adopted
the same strategy as hyperthermophilic EstE1 rather than cold-adapted
EstK, showing that cold-adapted enzymes could be specifically categorized
into two sets of enzymes, i.e., psychrophilic and psychrotrophic.
Furthermore, it gives insight that instead of global flexibility the
localized flexibility around active site is sufficient to render psychrophilic
characters, which is evident from the mutational and comparative studies
of EstSP1. The mutation of Tyr to a bulky Trp in EstSP1 was accommodated,
but not in hyperthermophilic esterase EstE1 as it disrupted both the
thermal stability and catalytic activity of EstE1 Y182W.22 It is very likely that the requirements of active-site
stabilization and high catalytic activity under respective physiological
conditions are the primary factors involved in the evolution of the
EstSP1 structure. Kovacic et al. showed that fine-tuned atomic interactions
in psychrophilic EstS by structural elements of Loop10 (having corresponding
Tyr residue) contributed significantly to the flexibility.31

Selective pressure of temperature provides
evolutionary response
with a defined set of rules that can impart desirable properties in
the adapted protein. Previous studies showed that site-specific evolution
of enzymes leaves distinct signatures on an organism’s genome
that are influenced by a dynamic relationship between structural and
functional constraints.46 The tendency
of certain amino acids to fine-tune atomic interactions and functions
at particular temperatures can lead to preferences for substitution
of one amino acid for another. For example, the cold-adapted organisms
may replace Arg residues with Lys to promote protein flexibility and
optimal protein function.47,48 Cold-adapted Archaea
have a higher content of uncharged amino acids, such as Gln and Thr,
and lower contents of hydrophobic amino acids, such as Leu.49 Systematic analysis of proteins adapted to different
temperatures showed that thermophilic proteins have a significantly
higher frequency of Tyr compared to mesophilic proteins.22,50,51

Our results are consistent
with recent predicted trends from computational
and statistical analyses that indicate that organisms living in extreme
environments (psychrophiles and thermophiles) have similar possibilities
of combining adaptation features and environmental constraints.52,53 These findings are concordant with the prediction of origin of the
last universal common ancestor, which assumes that the bacterial ancestor
is thermophilic; therefore, psychrophilic esterases retained some
features of their thermophilic ancestors.54 Our study strongly supports the idea that enzyme activity and conformational
flexibility are closely correlated, which is consistent with the hypothesis
that the psychrophilic enzyme EstSP1 evolved as a result of divergent
evolution from psychrotolerant esterases. On the basis of the results
of this and previous studies, we suggest that Tyr is favored in the
active-site wall of extremophilic enzymes (both psychrophilic esterases
and hyperthermophilic esterases) to stabilize the catalytic His loop
for optimum activity at extreme temperatures, whereas Trp is preferred
in psychrotolerant and mesophilic enzymes to ensure stability. EstSP1
can therefore serve as a model system for understanding enzyme evolution
and molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation. These findings can lead
to the development of protein engineering strategies for design of
more efficient proteins under extreme conditions.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
S. glacialis PAMC 26605 was kindly provided by Polar and Alpine Microbial Collection
(PAMC) of Korea Polar Research Institute (Incheon, South Korea).42,55 The strain formerly known as Sphingomonas sp. PAMC
26605 was named S. glacialis PAMC 26605
in the EzTaxon database based on its 16S rRNA homology to S. glacialis C16yT (99.78%).42,56,57 An EZchange site-directed mutagenesis
kit was obtained from Enzynomics (Daejeon, South Korea), whereas pET28a(+)
vector was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Additionally, HisTrap
and CaptoQ columns were purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway,
NJ), p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB)
was acquired from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and SYPRO orange dye was
procured from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). All other reagents
were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise noted.

Construction
of Expression Plasmid and Site-Directed Mutagenesis
The WT estSP1 gene (GenBank ID: WP_010186968.1)
was subcloned into a TA vector in our previous study.30 The mutations in EstSP1 were introduced using an EZchange
site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Four EstSP1 mutants at the Tyr191 position (Y191A, Y191F,
Y191H, and Y191W) and two EstSP1 mutants at the Ile287 position (I287A
and I287P) were generated using the WT estSP1 gene
as a template. The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are
listed in Table S1. The resulting PCR products
were treated with Dpn I to destroy all plasmid templates,
leaving only mutant DNA plasmid. The Dpn I-treated
PCR product was then transformed into E. coli DH5α. TA plasmids with the desired mutation were isolated
and confirmed by DNA sequencing, after which the mutant estSP1 genes were amplified from the TA vector and subcloned into a pET28a(+)
vector.

Protein Expression and Purification
Recombinant WT
and mutant EstSP1 proteins were purified to homogeneity as previously
described.30 Briefly, E.
coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with pET28a(+) vector
bearing the WT or mutant estSP1 gene was grown in
a shaking incubator at 37 °C until an OD600 of 0.6–0.8
was attained. After induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were grown for an additional 6 h
at 30 °C, after which they were harvested at 12 000g for 5 min. Following cell lysis by sonication, the crude
enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by nickel-chelate
affinity chromatography with a 1 mL HisTrap column using a linear
gradient of imidazole (20–500 mM) in buffer A (20 mM Tris·HCl,
100 mM M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5), followed by
anion-exchange chromatography with a 5 mL CaptoQ column using a linear
gradient of KCl (25–1000 mM) in buffer B (20 mM Tris·HCl,
25 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5). The purity of the enzyme
was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, and the protein
concentration was determined by the Bradford method. The purified
enzyme was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

Enzyme Assay
Enzyme activity was determined by measuring
the amount of p-nitrophenol formed by hydrolysis
of pNPB by 100 pmol of the enzyme. The concentration
of p-nitrophenol was measured with a Shimadzu UV-1800
spectrophotometer at 400 nm. One enzyme unit releases 1 μM p-nitrophenol per minute at 25 °C from pNPB. The reaction was conducted in 1 mL of buffer C (100 mM Tris·HCl,
pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) at 25 °C for 3 min. The background rate
of pNPB hydrolysis was subtracted for each reading.

Biochemical Characterization
The apparent optimum temperature
was determined by conducting the reaction at 4–80 °C in
reaction buffer D (100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol).
The thermal stability of WT and mutant EstSP1 enzymes was determined
by measuring the residual enzyme activity after exposing the enzyme
separately to different temperatures (4, 25, 40, 60, and 80 °C).
Residual activity was measured in buffer D every 20 min up to 2 h.
The enzyme activity before incubation was considered to be 100%.

The T50 value, which is the temperature
at which 50% of the enzyme activity is lost during a fixed incubation
period, was determined by incubating the aliquots of enzymes in buffer
D for 20 min at various temperatures. Residual activity was determined
and expressed as percentage of the initial activity measured at 40
°C.

Enzyme Kinetics and Thermodynamic Analysis
The catalytic
rate constant (kcat) and Michaelis–Menten
constant (Km) were determined by measuring
the reaction rate of WT and mutants in substrate (pNPB) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mM and 40 °C
for 3 min. The kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) were estimated by a Lineweaver–Burk
plot with the GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). The kcat parameter was calculated using the equation kcat = Vmax/[ET], and kcat values
at various temperatures were calculated to construct an Arrhenius
plot (ln kcat vs 1/T). The activation energy (Ea) of pNPB hydrolysis was determined from the slope of the Arrhenius
plot. Thermodynamic parameters (Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔG‡), enthalpy (ΔH‡), and entropy (ΔS‡)) were calculated as described by Lonhienne et al.58 using the following equations      In the above equations, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.3805 × 10–23 J K–1), h is the Plank constant
(6.6256 × 10–34 J s), k is
the catalytic rate constant, and R is the gas constant
(8.314 J mol–1 K–1).

Protein Thermal
Shift Analysis
Thermal shift analysis
was conducted on an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR instrument
using SYPRO orange as a dye.59 A thermal
denaturation curve was recorded from 25 to 99 °C using a fixed
protein concentration (5 μM) added to buffer C and SYPRO orange
dye in a total volume of 20 μL. The melting temperature (Tm), which is the temperature at which 50% of
the protein is unfolded, was determined using the protein thermal
shift analysis software from Applied Biosystems.

Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
The fluorescence emission
spectra of WT and mutant EstSP1 enzymes were measured using a Scinco
FS-2 fluorescence spectrometer at 25 °C and an excitation wavelength
of 280 nm. Acrylamide-dependent fluorescence quenching was determined
in the presence of increasing concentrations of acrylamide (0–0.5
M) with 0.5 μM of the enzyme in buffer B. Quenching data were
plotted using the GraphPad Prism software and presented as the ratio
of intrinsic fluorescence intensity (F0) to the fluorescence intensity with 0–0.5 M acrylamide (F). Temperature-dependent unfolding was determined by measuring
the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein samples by incubating at
different temperatures (4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C)
for 6 min. The changes in the fluorescence intensities at various
temperatures were shown as the ratio of fluorescence at 4 °C
(F0) to the fluorescence intensities at
increasing temperatures (F).

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Spectroscopy
The CD spectra
were analyzed to estimate the protein secondary structure and stability
using a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C at Korea Basic
Science Institute (Ochang, South Korea). The protein sample concentration
was 0.38 mg mL–1 in buffer B. Before measurement,
samples were incubated at the indicated temperature (4 or 40 °C).
The spectra were then plotted as residual ellipticity (mdeg) versus
wavelength (nm) using the GraphPad Prism software.

Sequence Analysis
and Homology Modeling
Multiple sequence
alignment was conducted using Clustal Omega.60 To gain insight into the three-dimensional structure of WT and mutant
EstSP1, a homology model was generated using the Swiss-Model server
(http://swissmodel.expasy.org/) with the crystal structure of Est8 (PDB ID: 4YPV) as a template.26 Multiple sequence alignment between EstSP1 and
Est8 showed 45% sequence identity with catalytic residues consisting
of Ser, His, and Asp (Figure S1a). A conserved
GXSXG motif containing a catalytic Ser residue and an HGGG motif involved
in oxyanion hole formation were also conserved. The Ramachandran plot
statistics validated by the PROCHECK program showed that more than
87% of the amino acids in the WT and mutant models were in the most
favored regions, whereas less than 11% were in additional allowed
regions, only 0.4% of residues were in generously allowed regions,
and 1.6% were in disallowed regions (Figure S1b and Table S2), signifying good quality of the structural models.
The predicted structure was visualized by the Chimera software.61 All structural models were submitted to the
Protein Model Database (PMDB),62 and the
accession numbers are listed in Table S3. Substrate-binding pocket volumes were calculated using the Computed
Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins (CASTp) database.63
