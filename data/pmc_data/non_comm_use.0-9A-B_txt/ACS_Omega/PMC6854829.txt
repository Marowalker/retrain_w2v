(Arylimido)vanadium(V) dichloride
complexes containing anionic N-heterocyclic carbene
(NHC) ligands that contain weakly
coordinating B(C6F5)3 moieties (WCA-NHC)
of the type [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)] (5, Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3, Ar′ =
2,6-iPr2C6H3) showed significant catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization
in the presence of Al cocatalysts (MAO and AliBu3); the activity by the 5–MAO
catalyst (19 500 kg-PE/mol-V·h; TOF 11 600 min–1) is the highest among those reported using the other
(imido)vanadium(V) complexes in the presence of MAO, and the 5–AliBu3 catalyst
showed higher activity (66 000 kg-PE/mol-V·h; TOF 39 200
min–1). The V K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) analyses (in toluene) strongly suggest the formation
of certain vanadium(III) species by reduction with AliBu3 accompanying structural changes; the
EXAFS analysis suggests the presence of the arylimido ligand and one
V–Cl bond (2.34 ± 0.04 Å), which is longer than those
[2.1901(8)–2.2462(8) Å] in the reported (imido)vanadium(V)
complexes. The XANES analysis of [V(NAr)Cl2(OAr)] strongly
suggests the formation of the other vanadium(III) species by reduction
with Me2AlCl or Et2AlCl, and the EXAFS analysis
suggests the presence of the arylimido ligand and two V–Cl
bonds (2.45 ± 0.03 Å). The XANES spectra showed no significant
changes in both the pre-edge peak(s) and the edge peak when these
complexes were treated with MAO, suggesting that the basic geometry
and the high oxidation state were preserved under these conditions.

Introduction
Transition-metal-catalyzed
olefin polymerization is the core method
in commercial production of polyolefin [exemplified as polyethylene
(PE) and polypropylene (PP)], and the design of the molecular catalysts
has been considered as an attractive subject especially in terms of
synthesis of new polymers.1−17 Classical Ziegler-type vanadium catalyst systems (e.g., VOCl3, VCl4, VCl3–AlBr3, AlCl3–AlPh3, AliBu3, and SnPh4) are known to exhibit
high reactivity toward olefins (notable propagation for synthesis
of ultrahigh-molecular-weight polymers with narrow distributions)18−23 and are applied for commercial production of EPDM (ethylene propylene
diene monomer) rubber.8,17,24−26,28

Although potentially
high initial catalytic activities were exhibited
using these catalyst systems, their rapid catalyst deactivation [probably
associated with conversion into the inactive species by reduction,
from vanadium(III) to vanadium(II)] causes very poor overall productivities.
The concern, short catalyst life, could be overcome partly by addition
of ethyl trichloroacetate (ETA),27 and
this would be assumed as due to the catalyst re-activation by re-oxidation
with ETA (Scheme 1);27 ethylene polymerizations with most of these
catalysts were thus performed in the presence of large excess of ETA.8,17,24−26 Therefore,
vanadium(III) species have been assumed to play a role as the active
species on the basis of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra and
titration study,29−32 as shown in Scheme 1.21,22,25 However, as
described below, ESR spectroscopy, widely employed for analysis of
paramagnetic compounds,32−38 faces concerns for the observation of “ESR-silent”
vanadium(III) species and the quantitative analysis and for obtainment
of structural information.

Scheme 1 Assumed Ethylene Polymerization Mechanism
in the Presence of Ethyl
Trichloroacetate (ETA)25
Studies on synthesis of the efficient vanadium complex
catalysts
and the related organometallic chemistry have been considered as important
subjects in the fields of catalysis, organometallic chemistry, and
polymer chemistry.8,16,17,28 (Adamantylimido)vanadium(V) complexes containing
2-anilidemethyl-pyridine, [V(NAd)X2(2-ArNCH2C5H4N)], [A; Ad = 1-adamantyl;
Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3; X = Cl, Me; Scheme 2],39,40 or 8-anilide-5,6,7-trihydroquinoline41 ligands have been known to exhibit significant catalytic activities
for selective ethylene dimerization in the presence of MAO cocatalysts,
whereas the related complexes containing 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)pyridine
ligands (B) showed the notable activities for ethylene
polymerization in the presence of Me2AlCl cocatalysts.42 The (arylimido)vanadium(V) complexes that contain
a monodentate anionic ancillary donor ligand (Y), [V(NAr)Cl2(Y)] [Y = phenoxide (C),43−45 iminoimidazolide (D),46 and iminoimidazolidide (E),46Scheme 2], showed the high activities for ethylene
polymerization and the copolymerization with norbornene (NBE) in the
presence of MAO or Me2AlCl and Et2AlCl. Moreover,
the complexes containing anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes
(NHCs) that contain a weakly coordinating borate moiety (WCA-NHC, F) exhibited high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization
in the presence of AliBu3,47 which has been considered as an ineffective
Al cocatalyst in the metal-catalyzed olefin polymerization.1−17,24−26,28,39−46

Scheme 2 Selected (Imido)vanadium(V) Dichloride Complex Catalysts for Ethylene
Polymerization and Dimerization39−47
It was demonstrated that cationic
alkyl species play a role in
the ethylene dimerization using the (A)–MAO catalyst,
on the basis of (i) 51V NMR and electron spin resonance
(ESR) spectra,40 (ii) the effect of the
Al cocatalyst and the ethylene pressure dependence,40 (iii) syntheses of the cationic (and the dimethyl) complexes
and their reaction chemistry,48 and (iv)
analysis through solution V K-edge XANES (XANES = X-ray absorption
near-edge structure) and the FT-EXAFS (EXAFS = extended X-ray absorption
fine structure) spectra.48 Analysis by
synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has been known to
provide important information of the oxidation states (through XANES
analysis; pre-edge and edge peaks) and their coordination atoms around
the centered metal (through FT-EXAFS analysis).49,50 XAS analysis has been widely used in the field of heterogeneous
catalysis,49−53 and the reports for studies in the field of molecular catalysis
are still limited.42,48,54−60

We recently introduced that the method should be useful for
analysis
of the vanadium catalyst solution, especially for ESR-silent paramagnetic
species, which cannot be observed by both NMR and ESR spectra.42,55,56,58,59 For example, 51V NMR (in toluene-d8) and ESR (in toluene) spectra showed negligible
resonances when complex B was treated with Me2AlCl (10.0 equiv) or when the toluene solution of complex F was treated with AliBu3 (10.0
equiv). In contrast, as shown in Figure 1 (XANES spectra), apparent changes in the
oxidation state were observed when the toluene solution containing B was treated with Me2AlCl (10.0 equiv, Figure 1a)42 or F (complex 3 in Scheme 3) was treated with AliBu3 (10.0 equiv, Figure 1b);59 the spectra
did not change when these complexes were treated with MAO. The low-energy
shifts in the edge absorption accompanied by changes in the pre-edge
peak strongly suggest that these complexes (B and F) were reduced by Al alkyls to form certain vanadium(III)
species. These results are thus consistent with those observed in
the 51V NMR and ESR spectra.42,58

Figure 1 V K-edge XANES
spectra (in toluene at 25 °C; 5.46 keV) for
(a) [V(NAd)Cl2(L)] [B; Ad = 1-adamantyl; L
= 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]42 and (b) [V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl2(WCA-NHC)] (F)58,59 in the presence of cocatalysts (MAO, Me2AlCl, AliBu3, 10.0 equiv).

Scheme 3 (Arylimido)vanadium(V) Complexes Coordinated with Anionic N-Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs) Containing a Weakly Coordinating
tris(Pentafluorophenyl) Borane Moiety [WCA-NHC-Ar (1–3), Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3; WCA-NHC-Ar′
(4, 5), Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3]
The above results clearly suggest the formation of certain
vanadium(III)
species by treatment of Me2AlCl or AliBu3,42,58,59 whereas the high oxidation state was preserved by addition of MAO.42,58 Moreover, it is clear that the XANES spectrum of the toluene solution
consisting of B-Me2AlCl should be different
from that consisting of F-AliBu3, especially in the edge region (Figure 1). In contrast, the oxidation state was preserved
when the dichloro complex containing the 2-anilidemethylpyridine ligand
(A) was treated with Me2AlCl (10.0 equiv),
which afforded ultrahigh-molecular-weight polymers in the reaction
with ethylene; the formation of another vanadium(V) species was thus
suggested from 51V NMR spectra and V K-edge XANES spectra.48 Since, as described below, a new (arylimido)vanadium(V)
dichloride complex containing the WCA-NHC-Ar′ ligand (5, Scheme 3, Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) showed promising characteristics as the ethylene
polymerization catalyst, we thus explored the effect of Al cocatalysts
on the oxidation state of the formed vanadium species by the solution
V K-edge XANES and EXAFS analyses (especially with complexes 3 and 5). Moreover, the studies with the phenoxide
analogues [exemplified as [V(NAr)Cl2(OAr)] (C), Scheme 2] were
also explored because the effect of the Al cocatalyst (MAO vs Me2AlCl) on both the activity and comonomer incorporation by C was significant in the ethylene/NBE copolymerization.44,45 Through this study, we explored for the obtainment of the information
of the active species, especially vanadium(III), formed by reaction
with Al alkyls, which should be important for understanding the catalysis
mechanism in the ethylene polymerization.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of (Arylimido)vanadium(V) Complexes Containing Anionic N-Heterocyclic Carbenes That Contain a Weakly Coordinating
B(C6F5)3 (WCA-NHC), [V(NR′)Cl2(WCA-NHC)], and Their Use as the Catalyst Precursors for Ethylene
Polymerization
Synthesis and Structural Analysis of [V(NR′)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)] (Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3)
Anionic N-heterocyclic carbene–borate (WCA-NHC) ligands have
been promising anionic ligands47,61−66 because it has been postulated that electron-deficient neutral or
cationic early transition-metal-alkyl species with high oxidation
states can be stabilized with the WCA-NHC ligands as anionic donor
ligands through σ- and/or π-donation and/or by delocalization.47,66

(Arylimido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing 2,6-diisopropylphenyl-modified
WCA-NHC ligands of type [V(NR′)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)]
[R′ = C6H5 (4), Ar (5); Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3; Ar′
= 2,6-iPr2C6H3] were prepared according to the reported procedure for syntheses
of [V(NR′)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar)] [R′ = Ad (1), C6H5 (2), Ar (3); Scheme 3]47 by treating V(NR′)Cl3 with lithium salts of the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl analogue64,65 in toluene. The resultant complexes were isolated as microcrystals
grown from cold CH2Cl2–n-hexane (−30 °C); the complexes were identified by NMR
spectra and elemental analysis, and their structures were determined
by X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 2).a It was revealed that the
resonance ascribed to 5 (410.5 ppm) in the 51V NMR spectrum was shifted low field compared to those in 1 (45.4 ppm), 2 (185.6 ppm), 3 (302.7 ppm),
and 4 (256.6 ppm).

114.92(3), and V–N(1)–C(1) 165.31(18). Selected bond
lengths (Å) for 5: V–Ccarbene 2.076(3),
V–N(1) 1.654(3), V–Cl(1) 2.1620(10), V–Cl(2)
2.1559(9), and N(1)–C(1) 1.386(5). Selected bond angles (deg)
for 5: Ccarbene–V–Cl(1) 106.53(8),
Ccarbene–V–Cl(2) 117.61(8), Ccarbene–V–N(1) 103.66(12), Cl(1)–V–Cl(2) 114.68(4),
and V–N(1)–C(1) 169.1(2). Detailed data are shown in
the Supporting Information (see footnote
a).

These complexes showed a distorted
tetrahedral geometry around
vanadium (Figure 2);
the V–Ccarbene bond distances [2.060(2) and 2.076(3)
Å for 4 and 5, respectively] are longer
than those in complexes 1–3 [2.039(3)–2.049(2)
Å]47 but are shorter than those in
the other complexes such as [VOCl3(NHC)]67 and [V(CHSiMe3)(NAd)(CH2SiMe3)(NHC)]68 [V–Ccarbene = 2.137 and 2.172(2) Å, respectively]. The results thus indicate
that the WCA-NHC-Ar′ ligands in 4 and 5 also act as a σ-donor toward vanadium. It seems that the degree
of the σ-donation especially in 5 would be rather
weak compared to that in 1–3, as
also seen from the chemical shift in the 51V NMR spectra
(described above). The V–Cl bond distances in 4 and 5 [2.1559(9)–2.1655(7) Å] are within
the range of those in 1–3 [2.1544(14)–2.1747(15)
Å],47 but, as discussed previously
for 1–3,47 the distances are shorter than those in the related dichloride complexes
[2.1901(8)–2.2462(8) Å] containing monodentate anionic
donor ligands (exemplified as complexes C–E in Scheme 2).46,69−71 The Cl(1)–V–Cl(2)
bond angles in 4 and 5 [114.92(3) and 114.68(4)°
for 4 and 5, respectively] are smaller than
those in 1–3 [116.26(5)–117.74(6)°],47 probably due to a steric bulk on the diisopropylphenyl
substituent on the NHC-B(C6F5)3 ligand.
The V–N(1) distances in 4 [1.646(3) Å] and 5 [1.654(3) Å] are relatively close to those in 2 and 3 [1.634(3) and 1.648(2) Å for 2 and 3, respectively],47 whereas the V–N(1)–C(1) bond angle in 5 [169.1(2)°] is larger than that in 3 [164.14(17)°]
and the angle in 4 [165.31(18)°] is smaller than
that in 2 [170.8(3)°].47 Taking into account these analysis data, as discussed for 1–3,47 the
WCA-NHC-Ar′ ligands play a role as σ donors in electron-deficient,
cationic 12-electron complexes in 4 and 5.

Ethylene Polymerization by [V(NR′)Cl2(L)]
in the Presence of Al Cocatalysts
Table 1 summarizes the results of ethylene polymerization
conducted in toluene at 25 °C using [V(NR′)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)] [R′ = C6H5 (4), 2,6-Me2C6H3 (5)] in the presence of MAO (d-MAO white solid, prepared
by removal of toluene and AlMe3 from TMAO, commercially
available from Tosoh Finechem Co.)72−74 or AliBu3 cocatalysts. The results obtained using [V(NR′)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar)] [R′ = Ad (1), C6H5 (2), and Ar (3)]47 are also shown for comparison.

It
should be noted that the 5–MAO catalyst
exhibited 10 times higher catalytic activity than the 3–MAO catalyst [e.g., activity: 1580 kg-PE/mol-V·h (by 3, run 3)47 vs 19 500 kg-PE/mol-V·h
(by 5, run 10)]. The catalyst afforded high-molecular-weight
polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions, suggesting
the formation of uniform catalytically active species in the solution.
The activity by 5 was affected by the amount of the Al
cocatalyst employed (runs 7–10), and the observed trend was
somewhat different from that observed in 3 (runs 3, 4).
Importantly, the activity by 5 (19 500 kg-PE/mol-V·h,
run 10) is higher than those reported by [V(NAr)Cl2(OAr)]
(C, 2930 kg-PE/mol-V·h, run 11),44 [V(NAr)Cl2{1,3-Ar2(CHN)2C=N}] (507 kg-PE/mol-V·h),46 [V(NAr)Cl2{1,3-Ar2(CH2N)2C=N}] (627 kg-PE/mol-V·h),46 and [V(NAd)Cl2{N=CtBu2}] (516 kg-PE/mol-V·h).68 The results thus demonstrate that 5 should be the most
active (imido)vanadium(V) complex catalyst in the presence of the
MAO cocatalyst, although the Mn values
in the resultant polymers were lower than those by C (Table 1). It also turned
out that the activity by the phenylimido analogue (4)–MAO
catalyst was low (run 5), as observed in 2.

It
was revealed that the 5–AliBu3 catalyst exhibited higher activities than the 5–MAO catalyst under the similar conditions [e.g.,
activity: 19 500 kg-PE/mol-V·h (run 10) vs 66 000
kg-PE/mol-V·h (run 25)]. Note that the 5–AliBu3 catalyst showed higher activity
than the 3–AliBu3 catalyst [e.g., activity: 11 000 kg-PE/mol-V·h
(by 3, run 12)47 vs 66 000
kg-PE/mol-V·h (by 5, run 25)], affording high-molecular-weight
polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions. The activity
by 5 was affected
by Al/V molar ratio (runs 17–27), and the observed trend was
somewhat different from that observed in 3 (runs 12,
13).47 It also turned out that the activities
by the 4–AliBu3 catalyst were low (runs 15, 16), as seen in the presence
of MAO.

The activity by the 5–AliBu3 catalyst (66 000 kg-PE/mol-V·h,
run 25) was higher than that by the [V(NAr)Cl2(OAr)]–Me2AlCl catalyst (C, 27 500 kg-PE/mol-V·h,
run 28)45 but was comparable to that by
the C–iBu2AlCl catalyst (64800 kg-PE/mol-V·h, run 29), which afforded
ultrahigh-molecular-weight polymers under these conditions.45 However, these polymerizations by C were conducted at 0 °C, and the activity decreased significantly
at 25 °C.43 A similar effect of retardations
(by increasing the temperature from 0 to 25 °C) was also observed
in the (arylimido)vanadium(V) complexes containing iminoimidazolide
or iminoimidazolidide ligands.46 As described
in the Introduction section, AliBu3 has been considered as an ineffective
Al cocatalyst in the metal-catalyzed olefin polymerization,1−17,24−26,28,39−46 but the use of AliBu3 should
be favored in terms of practical viewpoints, especially for the establishment
of a halogen-free process (without using halogenated Al) and for using
an inexpensive Al cocatalyst compared to MAO.

K-Edge XANES and EXAFS Analyses of Reactions of (Arylimido)vanadium(V)
Dichloride Complexes Containing Phenoxide and WCA-NHC Ligands with
Al Alkyls. Effects of Anionic Ancillary Donor Ligands and Al Cocatalysts
As described in the Introduction section,
metal-alkyl species play an important role in olefin polymerization/dimerization.
It was demonstrated that cationic vanadium(V) alkyl species play a
role in the ethylene dimerization using [V(NAd)X2(2-ArNCH2C5H4N)] (A, X = Cl, Me;
Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3)–MAO catalysts,
whereas another cationic vanadium(V) alkyl species plays a role in
the ethylene polymerization using A–Me2AlCl or Et2AlCl catalysts.40,48 The different
catalyst behaviors in the reactions with ethylene (in the presence
of MAO or Me2AlCl cocatalysts) could be thus explained
as due to the catalyst/cocatalyst nuclearity effect (the formation
of isolated or associated cationic alkyl species due to different
cation/anion interactions).10,12,40,56,75,76 In contrast, as also described in the Introduction section (Figure 1), certain vanadium(III) species were formed
when [V(NAd)Cl2(L)] [B, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
was treated with Me2AlCl (Figure 1a)42 or [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar)] (3) was treated with AliBu3 (Figure 1b).58,59 The high oxidation
states were preserved when complex B or 3 was treated with MAO, suggesting that vanadium(V) species play a
role in the ethylene polymerization.42,48 Since the
XANES spectra, especially in the edge region (shoulder-edge), are
apparently different between B–Me2AlCl
and 3–AliBu3 catalysts (Figure 1), we thus herein explore solution XANES and EXAFS analyses of complexes 3 and 5 to obtain more information concerning
the active species.

Figure 3 shows V K-edge XANES spectra of [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar)] (3) and [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)]
(5, Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) in the presence of MAO or AliBu3 (in toluene at 25 °C,
50 μmol-V/mL). As reported previously,58 the XANES spectrum of 3 shows sharp pre-edge peak(s),
which are typically observed in the complex with the tetrahedral geometry,
at 5466.6 eV (and 5465.1 eV) ascribed to a transition from 1s to 3d
+ 4p.55,56,77−79 A shoulder-edge peak, ascribed to an absorption of the V–Cl
bond,55,56 was also observed at 5478.1 eV. The diisopropylphenyl
analogue (5) also shows the pre-edge peak(s) at 5466.9
eV (and 5465.1 eV) and the shoulder-edge peak at 5478.0 eV. It turned
out that the pre-edge peaks in 5 were shifted slightly
at 5464.5 eV with a decrease in the intensity of the shoulder-edge
peak by addition of MAO (10 equiv, Figure 3), suggesting that the oxidation state and
the basic framework (geometry) were preserved. In contrast, as observed
in 3 (Figures 1a, 3), significant changes in the XANES
spectrum (pre-edge and edge peaks) were observed when 5 was treated with AliBu3 (100
equiv, Figure 3). An
apparent decrease in the pre-edge intensity (observed as a small shoulder
at 5465.1 eV) upon addition of AliBu3 clearly suggests a structural change, and the large low-energy
shift in the edge absorption, which is very close to that observed
in the 3–AliBu3 system, strongly suggests the formation of vanadium(III)
species by reduction.b

Ph (6b);44 and iPr, iPr (6c)43] and [V(NAr)(OAr)3] (7).80 The dichloride complexes containing phenoxide
ligands (6a–c) have been chosen in
this study because 6a (corresponds to C in Scheme 2) showed the highest
activities for ethylene polymerization43−45 and ethylene copolymerization
with norbornene (NBE)44,45 in the presence of Al cocatalysts.
It was demonstrated that the activities and the NBE incorporation
in the (co)polymerization were highly affected by the Al cocatalyst
employed (MAO vs Me2AlCl or Et2AlCl);44,45 the 6a,b–Et2AlCl catalyst
showed the higher catalytic activities but less NBE incorporation
than the 6a,b–MAO catalyst in the
ethylene/NBE copolymerization.44

the presence of MAO (10 equiv), (b) 6a in the presence

(3) or [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)] (5, Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) in the presence of AliBu3 (100 equiv).

As reported previously (for 6a,b),59 the XANES spectra of 6a–c showed pre-edge peaks (and shoulder peaks) [5466.8 (and
5465.3) eV (6a), 5467.4 (and 5465.2) eV (6b), and 5466.9 (and 5465.7) eV (6c), respectively], which
are similar to those in 3, 5, and [V(NAr)Cl3] [5466.8 (and 5465.0) eV]48 and
shoulder-edge peaks (marked in the dashed circle in Figure 4a; 5478.2, 5478.2, and 5478.9
eV, respectively). The tris(phenoxide) analogue (7) showed
only a sharp pre-edge peak at 5467.1 eV, clearly suggesting that the
shoulder-edge peaks in 6a–c are ascribed
to an absorption of the V–Cl bond.55,56 The pre-edge peak positions in the spectra of 6a,b did not change (5466.8 and 5467.0 eV, respectively) upon
addition of MAO (10 equiv) with an increase in the intensity, and
the edge absorptions shifted slightly (Figures 4a and S2–1).c The results thus suggest that the oxidation
state and the basic framework were preserved even upon addition of
MAO; the facts also suggest that cationic alkyl species with vanadium(V)
play a role in this catalysis, as demonstrated previously.42,48,55,56,58

Note that notable changes in the edge
peaks (shoulder-edge at 5475.7
eV) were observed when 6a was treated with Me2AlCl or Et2AlCl (50 equiv, Figure 4b), and the spectra did not change upon the
further addition of NBE (50 equiv). It seems that the pre-edge peak
in 6a [5466.8 (and 5465.3) eV] shifted to low energy
or became one absorption band upon addition of Me2AlCl
(5465.7 eV) or Et2AlCl (5465.9 eV). A similar XANES spectrum
was observed when 6c was treated with Me2AlCl
(50 equiv, Figure 4c), and these edge peaks (absorptions) were observed in a low-photon-energy
region compared to that in the (imido)vanadium(IV) complex. The results
thus suggest that 6a,c were reduced by Me2AlCl to afford certain vanadium(III) species, as suggested
by the reaction of 3 and 5 with AliBu3 (as shown in Figures 1b and 3).

It
should also be noted that the observed XANES spectra (in both
intensities in the pre-edge peaks and edge peaks) of 6a with addition of Me2AlCl or Et2AlCl are apparently
different from those of 3 or 5 with AliBu3. The spectra (6a–Me2AlCl), especially in the pre-edge intensities,
are also different from those of [V(NAd)Cl2(L)] (B) containing 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine
ligands with addition of Me2AlCl (Figure 1a);42 the pre-edge
intensity by B–Me2AlCl further decreased
upon addition of ETA (Cl3CCO2Et), whereas the
intensity decreased slightly by the reaction of 6a with
Me2AlCl.42 It has been known
that pre-edge intensities are affected by the basic geometry around
vanadium; a compound in Td symmetry generally
shows much higher pre-edge peak intensity than that in Oh symmetry due to a difference in the possibility of a
p–d orbital hybridization.77 These
results thus suggest that different vanadium(III) species (geometry
and ligands) play roles in the ethylene (co)polymerization (see footnote
b).

Moreover, as shown in Figure S2-2 (see
footnote c), the shoulder-edge intensity (at 5475.7 eV) decreased
when ETA (50 equiv) was added into a toluene solution of 6a, Me2AlCl (50 equiv), and NBE (50 equiv), whereas the
intensity (at 5475.7 eV) increased with a decrease in the pre-edge
intensity (at 5465.5 eV) when a toluene solution of B and Me2AlCl was added with ETA.42 The observed facts also correspond to the facts that the activity
in ethylene polymerization by 6a decreased upon addition
of ETA,45 whereas the activity by B increased upon addition of ETA,42 as seen in most vanadium complex and classical Ziegler-type vanadium
catalyst systems (as described in the Introduction section).8,16,17,23−28 These also suggest that different catalytically active vanadium(III)
species would play roles in these catalyses.

As
summarized in Table 2, the observed V–N distance by the EXAFS analysis (1.62
± 0.03 Å) in 3 is close to that determined
by X-ray crystallography [1.654(3) Å], and one of the observed
V–Cl bond distances by the EXAFS analysis (2.16 ± 0.04
Å) is close to those determined by X-ray crystallography [2.1559(9)
and 2.1620(10) Å]. Another V–Cl bond distance (2.34±
0.05 Å) was much longer than those in the related dichloride
complexes [2.1901(8)–2.2462(8) Å, by X-ray crystallography]46,69−71 containing monodentate anionic donor ligands (such
as phenoxides, ketimides, iminoimidazolides, etc.). However, the V–Ccarbene bond [2.076(3) Å] was not observed or may be overlapped
with the V–N bond (coordination number, 2.1 ± 0.2, Table 2). This could be assumed
as due to the flexibility of the anionic WCA-NHC ligand in solution
or explained by a simple speculation that the anionic NHC ligand binds
to vanadium strongly in solution (the short V–Ccarbene bond distance compared to that in the solid state).

It should
be noted that both EXAFS oscillation and the FT-EXAFS
spectrum of 3 changed drastically by treatment with AliBu3 (100 equiv, Figure 5a,b), as observed in the XANES
spectra (Figures 1b
and 3). It turned out that the imido ligand
(V–N bond, 1.66 ± 0.17 Å) was preserved, and one
V–Cl bond (2.34 ± 0.04 Å), which is longer than those
in the reported (imido)vanadium complexes with anionic donor ligands
(shown above),46,69−71,81 was also observed. However, the V–Calkyl bond, which should be present in catalysis, could not be defined
in this analysis. Since the formed species are considered as vanadium(III)
species on the basis of 51V NMR and ESR spectra, and the
XANES spectra in solution,58 it is thus
suggested that the Cl atom would be coordinated to vanadium (containing
imido and alkyl ligands) as a neutral donor ligand probably bridged
through Al.

It should also be noted that the imido ligand (V–N
bond,
1.64 ± 0.04 Å, Table 3) was preserved after treatment of 6a with Me2AlCl. It also turned out that two V–Cl bonds were observed
as the coordinating atoms to vanadium, and the long V–Cl bond
distances (2.45 ± 0.03 Å) compared to those in 6a (2.18 ± 0.03 Å) would suggest that these Cl ligands coordinated
to vanadium (containing imido and alkyl ligands) as neutral (or weak
anionic) donor ligands (bridged through Al).81 In contrast, no significant changes in both the EXAFS oscillation
and the FT-EXAFS spectrum were observed when 6a was treated
with MAO, as observed in the XANES spectra; no significant differences
in the both V–N and V–Cl bond distances were observed
in the EXAFS analysis, except a decrease in the coordination number
of Cl by treatment with MAO. These results thus suggest that the basic
framework including the oxidation state was preserved by treatment
of 6a with MAO.

Taking into account these analysis
results, one V–Cl bond
(2.34 ± 0.04 Å) was observed upon treatment of 3 with AliBu3 and two V–Cl
bonds (2.45 ± 0.03 Å) were observed in the reaction of 6a with Me2AlCl; three V–Cl bonds [2.455(7)
Å] were observed in the reaction of [V(NAd)Cl2(L)]
[B, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]
with Me2AlCl.42 In all cases,
vanadium(III) species containing the imido V–N bond were formed
on the basis of XANES and EXAFS analyses. Although we could not define
the V–Calkyl bond, which should play a role in the
ethylene (co)polymerization, the observed differences strongly suggest
that three different active vanadium(III) species were formed depending
upon the anionic donor and Al cocatalyst employed.

Concluding Remarks
(Arylimido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes that contain anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) coordinated with a weakly
coordinating B(C6F5)3 moiety, [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)] (5, Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3, Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3), exhibited remarkable
catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization in the presence of
Al cocatalysts (MAO and AliBu3). The activity by the 5–MAO catalyst (19 500
kg-PE/mol-V·h) was much higher than that by the dimethylphenyl
analogue, [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar)] (3) and
those reported using the reported (imido)vanadium(V) complexes containing
monodentate anionic ligands.44,46,67 The 5–AliBu3 catalyst showed higher activity (66 000 kg-PE/mol-V·h)
than 5–MAO and 3–AliBu3 catalysts, affording rather high-molecular-weight
polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions (Mn = 1.37 × 105, Mw/Mn = 2.35).

The solution
V K-edge XANES analyses of 3 and 5 strongly
suggest the formation of vanadium(III) species
by reduction with AliBu3, accompanying
structural changes (geometry) around vanadium (supported by changes
in the pre-edge peak and decrease in the intensity) (see footnote
b). The solution EXAFS analysis suggests the formation of vanadium
species containing arylimido ligands and one V–Cl bond (2.34
± 0.04 Å), which is longer than those in the reported (imido)vanadium(V)
dichloride complexes that contain monodentate anionic ligands [2.1901(8)–2.2462(8)
Å, by X-ray crystallography];46,69−71the V–Calkyl bond, which should be present in catalysis,
could not be defined in this analysis.

Moreover, the solution
XANES analysis of [V(NAr)Cl2(OAr)]
(6a) also suggests the formation of vanadium(III) species
by reduction with Me2AlCl or Et2AlCl (supported
by changes in the edge peaks). The observed XANES spectra especially
in the edge region (shoulder-edge at 5475.7 eV) are different from
those observed in the toluene solution containing 3 or 5 and AliBu3. The solution
EXAFS analysis suggests the formation of vanadium species containing
arylimido ligands and two V–Cl bonds (2.45 ± 0.03 Å),
although the presence of the V–Calkyl bond could
not be defined.

In contrast, no significant changes in both
XANES and EXAFS spectra
were observed by treatment of these complexes (3, 6a) with MAO, suggesting the preservation of the basic framework
(a distorted 4-coordinate tetrahedral geometry) and the oxidation
state; these results thus suggest that cationic (arylimido)vanadium(V)
species play a role in the ethylene polymerization in the presence
of the MAO cocatalyst. Results concerning the effect of the Al cocatalyst
in ethylene polymerization and XANES analysis of 3, 5, and 6a are summarized in Scheme 4.

Reaction Chemistry through Solution XANES Analysis
Results
for [V(NAd)Cl2(L)] [B, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine]42 are also shown for comparison.

The facts observed for 3, 5,
and 6a by treatment with AliBu or
Me2AlCl demonstrate a unique contrast to the fact in the
EXAFS analysis that more than two (three) V–Cl bonds [2.455(7)
Å] were observed when [V(NAd)Cl2(L)] [B, L = 2-(2′-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine] was treated
with Me2AlCl, which showed remarkable activity for ethylene
polymerization.42 In addition to the observed
difference in the XANES spectra as well as the catalyst behavior (the
effect of Cl3CCO2Et in 6a and B in ethylene polymerization, Scheme 4), it should be considered that three different
vanadium(III) species play roles in the ethylene polymerization depending
upon the anionic donor and the Al cocatalyst employed. Moreover, we
can at least say that these vanadium(III) species could be stabilized
by the coordination of neutral donor ligands exemplified as Cl.

As described in the Introduction section,42,55,56,58,59 reported examples of analysis of (NMR and
ESR-silent) vanadium(III) species as well as the study of homogeneous
catalysis using solution XANES and EXAFS spectra are limited. As far
as we know, this should be the first demonstration of the formation
of different vanadium(III) species generated by reactions of vanadium
complexes with Al alkyls through XAS analysis. We highly believe that
the information should be potentially important for better understanding
the study of the catalysis mechanism and organo-vanadium chemistry.
Moreover, these data also demonstrate that the solution XAS analysis
should be a powerful method for the obtainment
of information concerning the catalytically active species in solution.
More detailed analysis including the observation of V–Calkyl and V–CNHC bonds will be expected by
the development of the analysis method (or measurements at low temperature),
and the simulation of the active species on the basis of EXAFS spectra
might also be possible; we thus expect further progress in this project.

Experimental
Section
General Procedure
All experiments were conducted under
a nitrogen atmosphere in a vacuum atmospheres dry box. Toluene, dichloromethane,
and n-hexane of anhydrous grades (Kanto Kagaku Co.,
Ltd.) were transferred into a bottle containing molecular sieves (a
mixture of 3A 1/16, 4A 1/8, and 13 × 1/16) in the dry box; solvents
were passed through an alumina short column prior to use. V(NC6H5)Cl339 and
V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl382 were prepared according to a published method.
WCA-NHC-Ar′ (NHC-Ar′ = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropyl)-imidazolin-2-ylidene]
and Li(WCA-NHC-Ar′)(toluene) were prepared according to the
reported procedure.64,83 AliBu3, Me2AlCl, and Et2AlCl (Kanto
Kagaku Co., Ltd) and ethylene (polymerization grade, purity >99.9%,
Sumitomo Seika Co. Ltd.) were used as received. Solid MAO (d-MAO) samples were prepared by the removal of toluene and
AlMe3 from the commercially available TMAO [9.5 wt % (Al)
toluene solution, Tosoh Finechem Co.] in the dry box under reduced
pressure (at ca. 50 °C for removing toluene, AlMe3, and then heated at >100 °C for 1 h for the completion).72−74

All 1H, 13C, 19F, and 51V NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV500 spectrometer
(500.13 MHz for 1H, 125.77 MHz for 13C, 470.59
MHz for 19F, and 131.55 MHz for 51V). All spectra
were recorded in the solvent indicated at 25 °C unless otherwise
noted. Chemical shifts are given in ppm and are referenced to SiMe4 (δ 0.00 ppm, 1H, 13C), CFCl3 (δ 0.00 ppm, 19F), and VOCl3 (δ
0.00 ppm, 51V). Coupling constants and half-width values,
Δν1/2, are given in hertz.
Elemental analyses were performed by an EAI CE-440 CHN/O/S elemental
analyzer (Exeter Analytical, Inc.).

Synthesis of [V(NC6H5)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)]
(4, Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3)
The basic synthetic procedure of 4 was analogous to that of [V(NC6H5)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar)] (2, Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3),47 except that Li(WCA-NHC-Ar′)
was used in place of Li(WCA-NHC-Ar). Into a toluene solution (40 mL)
containing V(NC6H5)Cl3 (177 mg, 0.713
mmol), Li(WAC-NHC-Ar′)(toluene) (715 mg, 0.716 mmol) was added
at −30 °C. The reaction mixture was warmed slowly to room
temperature, and the mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature
overnight. The resultant mixture was passed through a Celite pad;
the filter cake was washed with toluene. After the removal of volatiles
from the combined filtrate and the wash, the resultant solid was dissolved
in a minimum amount of dichloromethane. The chilled solution layered
with n-hexane afforded red microcrystals in the freezer
(−30 °C, 83 mg, 74.6 μmol, yield: 10%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, C6D6 at 25 °C): δ

Synthesis of [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)] (5,
Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3)
The basic
synthetic procedure of 5 was analogous to that of [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar)] (3),47 except that Li(WCA-NHC-Ar′) was used in place of Li(WCA-NHC-Ar).
Into a toluene solution (40 mL) containing V(NAr)Cl3 (200
mg, 0.723 mmol), Li(WAC-NHC-Ar′)(toluene) (722 mg, 0.723 mmol)
was added at −30 °C. The reaction mixture was continuously
stirred at room temperature overnight. The resultant mixture was passed
through a Celite pad; the filter cake was washed with toluene. After
the removal of volatiles from the combined filtrate and the wash,
the resultant solid was dissolved in a minimum amount of dichloromethane.
The chilled solution layered with n-hexane afforded
red microcrystals in the freezer (−30 °C, 116 mg, 102
μmol, yield: 14%). Yield 116 mg (0.102 mmol, 14%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, C6D6 at 25 °C): δ

found: C, 57.14; H, 4.54; N, 3.46. The structure of 5 could be determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis (CCDC 1949093).

Typical Ethylene Polymerization Procedure
Into a stainless-steel
autoclave (100 mL scale), toluene and the Al cocatalyst (total 29
mL) were added in the dry box. A toluene solution (1.0 mL) containing
a prescribed amount of the catalyst (1.0 or 0.2 μmol/mL) was
then added into the autoclave filled with ethylene (1 atm); the reactor
was then pressurized immediately to 7 atm (total 8 atm), and the mixture
was stirred magnetically for 10 min. After the reaction, the chilled
mixture in the autoclave was then poured into MeOH containing HCl.
The resultant polymer (white precipitate) was collected on a filter
paper by filtration and was adequately washed with MeOH. The resultant
polymer was then dried in vacuo at 60 °C for 2 h.

Analysis of
Catalyst Solution by Solution-Phase X-ray Absorption
Spectroscopy (XAS)
V K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure
(XANES) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were
carried out at the BL01B1 beam line at the SPring-8 facility of the
Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (proposal nos. 2016A1455,
2016B1509, 2017A1512, 2018A1245, and 2018B1335). V K-edge XAFS spectra
of V complex samples [toluene solution, 50 μmol/mL, at 25 °C;
a Si (111) two-crystal monochromator was used for the incident beam]
were recorded in the fluorescence mode using an ionization chamber
as the I0 detector and 19 solid-state
detectors as the I detector. The X-ray energy was
calibrated using V2O5, and the data analysis
was performed with the REX2000 Ver. 2.5.9 software package (Rigaku
Co.). The XANES data was analyzed using a cubic spline from the χ
spectra with the removal of the atomic absorption background and their
normalization to the edge height.

Crystallographic Analysis
The measurements for [V(NC6H5)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)] (4, CCDC 1949138) and [V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)]
(5, CCDC 1949093)
were performed using a Rigaku XtaLAB P200 diffractometer with multilayer
mirror monochromated Mo Kα radiation. The crystal collection
parameters are given in the Supporting Information (see footnote a). The data were collected at 180 °C and processed
using CrystalClear (Rigaku)84 or CrysAlisPro
(Rigaku Oxford Diffraction),85 and the
structure was solved by direct methods86 and expanded using Fourier techniques. The nonhydrogen atoms were
refined anisotropically, and some hydrogen atoms were refined using
the riding model. All calculations were performed using the Crystal
Structure87 crystallographic software package,
except for refinement, which was performed using SHELXL Version 2014/7.88,89 Cif and xyz files are shown in the Supporting Information, and the crystallographic data was deposited at
the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC 1949093 and 1949138).

b The reviewer commented that reduction
of [V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar′)] (5) or
[V(NAr)Cl2(WCA-NHC-Ar)] (3) occurred by the
reaction with AliBu3 via β-hydrogen
elimination, and this is the most probable route. However, the mechanism
for the formation of (arylimido)vanadium(III) species is unclear at
this moment.

c Additional XANES
spectra and EXAFS
and FT-EXAFS spectra (in toluene at 25 °C) including fitting
curves and the analysis data of [V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)Cl2(WCA-NHC)] (3) and [V(NAr)Cl2(OAr)] (6a) are shown in the Supporting Information.
