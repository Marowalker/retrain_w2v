We probe the role
of surface functionalization and physical properties
of nanoinclusions in thermal conductivity enhancement during liquid–solid
phase transition in a hexadecane-based phase change material (PCM).
Hexadecane-based PCM is loaded with six different nanoinclusions:
carbon black nanopowder (CBNP), nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs), copper
nanoparticles, silver nanowires (AgNWs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes,
and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). The nanoinclusions CBNP, NiNP,
AgNW, and GNP are surface-functionalized with oleic acid. Nanoinclusion-loaded
PCM showed a large enhancement in thermal conductivity, which was
more prominent in the solid state. Interestingly, a maximum thermal
conductivity enhancement of ∼122% was observed in the solid
state for the PCM loaded with 0.01 wt % CBNP. Higher thermal conductivity
enhancement in the solid state is attributed to the formation of a
nanocrystalline network structure during freezing of the PCM, consisting
of a needlelike microstructure, which is confirmed by optical phase
contrast microscopy. During solidification, the nanoinclusions are
driven toward the grain boundaries, thereby forming a quasi-two-dimensional
network of percolating structures with high thermal transport efficiency
due to the enhancement of phonon-mediated heat transfer and near-field
radiative heat transfer. Thermal conductivity increases with the increased
loading of the nanoinclusions due to the formation of more interconnecting
aggregates. Among the carbon-based nanoinclusions, the highest thermal
conductivity enhancement is obtained for the PCM loaded with CBNP,
which is attributed to the low fractal dimensions and volume-filling
capability of CBNP aggregates. In the case of metallic nanoinclusions,
the highest thermal conductivity enhancement is obtained for the PCM
loaded with AgNW, which is due to the large aspect ratio of AgNW.
The carboxylic group of oleic acid attached to the nanoinclusions
is found to provide better steric stability with insignificant aggregation
and improved thermal stability, which are beneficial for practical
applications. Our results indicate that the initial thermal conductivity
of carbon-based nanoinclusions has an insignificant role in the thermal
conductivity enhancement of the PCM but the volume-filling capability
of the nanoinclusion has a prominent role. The findings from the present
study will be beneficial for tailoring the properties of nanoinclusion-loaded
organic PCM for thermal energy storage and reversible thermal switching
applications at room temperature.

Introduction
The
quest for efficient cooling materials for diverse technologies
drive the current research activities on thermal properties of new
materials.1−4 Organic phase change materials (PCMs) are being developed as efficient
agents for thermal energy storage and management to reduce the global
energy consumption and for intermediate storage of thermal energy
from renewable energy sources like solar energy and waste heat recovery.5−9 Thermal energy storage can be classified into three categories,
viz., sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and thermochemical
heat storage.10 Among these three techniques,
latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) using organic phase change
materials (PCMs) is particularly advantageous due to higher energy
storage density at a relatively constant temperature corresponding
to the phase transition temperature of the PCM.11 Sharma et al.12 reported a 3–4
times higher energy storage per unit volume for a LHTES system, as
compared to that for a sensible heat storage system for a temperature
difference of 20 °C, which shows the efficacy of PCM-based thermal
energy storage for practical applications. Although PCMs with various
types of phase transitions have been experimentally studied,11,13 PCMs with liquid–solid first-order phase transition are particularly
beneficial for practical applications due to smaller volume changes
during phase transition (<10%), ease of incorporation in the host
matrix, and economic viability.10 In liquid–solid
phase transition, energy is stored during melting, which is subsequently
recovered during solidification, and the heat storage capacity of
a typical PCM across liquid–solid first-order phase transition
can be expressed by the following equation12 1  Here Hst, cps, cpl, Tm, T1, T2, m, fm,
and Δhm indicate the heat storage
capacity, specific heat in the solid and liquid states, melting point
of the PCM, initial operating temperature (<Tm), final operating temperature (>Tm), mass of the PCM, melting fraction, and specific enthalpy
change,
respectively. Equation 1 clearly shows that the heat storage capacity of a PCM is primarily
determined by the associated phase transition temperature and enthalpy
change.

Compared with inorganic PCMs, organic PCMs have several
advantages
such as lower vapor pressure during melting, reduced degree of supercooling,
high latent heat, lower cost, chemical inertness, nontoxicity, and
higher thermal stability after repeated melting/freezing cycles.14 Organic PCMs have found widespread applications
in various industries, viz., thermal management of buildings, domestic
and commercial refrigeration, concentrated solar thermal plants, and
solar energy storage.5−9,14−16

Applicability
of organic PCMs for efficient thermal energy storage
is severely restricted by the lower thermal conductivity of these
materials9 and hence, various strategies
have been developed for enhancing the thermal conductivity of these
organic PCMs, viz., dispersing high-thermal-conductivity nanoinclusions,8,9,17 inserting a metal framework,
encapsulation and impregnating with porous materials.11,17 Among these methods, nanoinclusion-assisted enhancement in the thermal
conductivity of organic PCMs has been the most popular due to the
ease of sample preparation and cost efficiency. Nanoinclusion-assisted
enhancement in thermal conductivity has been reported for a wide range
of organic PCMs loaded with various kinds of nanoinclusions, viz.,
graphene/1-octadecanol,9 oleylamine-functionalized
reduced graphene oxide/palmitic acid,14 single-walled carbon nanotube/n-octadecane,7 etc.

Zheng et al.18 reported reversible thermal
switching across the liquid–solid phase transition of graphite/hexadecane
PCM at T = 18 °C and observed ∼3.2 times
enhancement in the thermal conductivity of the PCM loaded with 0.8
vol % graphite nanoinclusions, in the solid state. Sun et al.19 reported ∼3 times enhancement in the
thermal conductivity of functionalized multiwalled carbon-nanotube-loaded
hexadecane, in the solid state, for 0.4 vol % loading. Schiffres et
al.20 reported 2.3–3 times enhancement
in the thermal conductivity of multilayer graphene/hexadecane PCM,
in the solid state, for loading concentration of 1 vol %. Such large
thermal conductivity enhancement for nanoinclusion-loaded hexadecane,
in the solid state, was attributed to the formation of needlelike
microstructures during solidification and aggregation of the nanoinclusions
along the grain boundaries, forming a percolating network with a higher
thermal transport efficiency.18−20 Recently, significant enhancement
in the thermal conductivity of n-hexadecane was achieved
by inverse miceller templating and loading with various nanoinclusions
such as graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs), and copper nanowires.8,17

Although nanoinclusion-assisted
thermal conductivity enhancement
of hexadecane is well studied, the effect of aggregation and cluster
formation is not fully understood.21,22 Eapen et al.23 discussed the effects of percolating structures
on thermal conductivity enhancement beyond the classical Maxwell limit.
Moreover, earlier studies on hexadecane-based nanoinclusions were
primarily focused on carbon-based nanoinclusions and reports on the
effects of metallic nanoinclusions (apart from copper nanowire17) on thermal conductivity enhancement during
liquid–solid phase transition are scarce. Furthermore, the
effect of surface functionalization of the nanoinclusions on thermal
conductivity enhancement and long-term stability in hexadecane-based
PCM is not known. Xia et al.24 reported
that surface functionalization results in superior stability but adversely
affects the thermal conductivity enhancement. Hermida-Merino et al.6 also reported that surface functionalization
decisively influences the transport properties.

Hexadecane-based
PCMs are technologically important candidates
for room temperature (phase transition temperature near 18 °C)
thermal energy storage and reversible thermal switching applications.
Here, we probe the effects of various types of nanoinclusions on the
thermal conductivity enhancement and the effects of surface functionalization
and aggregation on thermal conductivity and thermal stability of such
PCM, which are important to tailor nanoinclusion-loaded PCMs for practical
applications.

In the present study, enhancement in the thermal
conductivity of
hexadecane-based PCM loaded with three different carbon-based nanoinclusions,
viz., carbon black nanopowder (CBNP), multiwalled carbon nanotubes,
and graphene nanoplatelets, and three metallic nanoinclusions, viz.,
silver nanowire (AgNW), nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs), and copper nanoparticles
(CuNPs) is systematically studied. In the case of carbon-based nanoinclusions,
multiwalled carbon nanotube has a larger aspect ratio with respect
to the graphene nanoplatelets, which are two-dimensional (2D) structures
with fractal morphology. Additionally, a comparatively cheaper alternative,
viz., carbon black nanopowder, is selected to compare the thermal
conductivity enhancement at similar concentrations. Among the metallic
nanoinclusions, silver nanowire has a larger aspect ratio as compared
to that of the other two metallic nanoinclusions (nickel and copper
nanoparticles), which are of spherical shapes, but with widely varying
bulk thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity enhancements are experimentally
measured using a transient hot-wire probe. The sample temperature,
during liquid–solid phase transition, is remotely monitored
using infrared thermography (IRT). The gain in freezing time for nanoinclusion-loaded
PCM is determined from the normalized temperature decay curves, obtained
from infrared thermography, for the first time. In addition, the effect
of surfactant capping on thermal conductivity enhancement and thermal
stability is also studied. Thermal stability of the nanoinclusion-loaded
PCM is probed by repeated thermal cycling. Optical phase contrast
microscopy is used to obtain insight into the microscale aggregation
phenomena during consecutive thermal cycling.

Mechanism of Thermal Conductivity
Enhancement
Thermal conductivity enhancement of nanoinclusion-loaded
organic
phase change materials is primarily governed by the aggregation phenomena.25,26 The nanoinclusions, when dispersed within a matrix of PCM, form
clusters, which act as efficient percolating structures for heat transfer.22 Moreover, during solidification, the clusters
are squeezed toward the grain boundaries, forming a network of percolating
structures, which results in large enhancement of thermal conductivity
in the solid state.18,19

Effect of Cluster Formation
The aggregation dynamics
and the effects of cluster formation on thermal conductivity enhancement
in nanoinclusion-loaded PCM are explained on the basis of a three-level
homogenization model of Prasher and Evans.25 The nanoinclusions form aggregates due to van der Waals interaction,
and these aggregates grow in size with the increasing concentration
of the nanoinclusions, resulting in an enhancement of thermal conductivity,
as the nanoinclusions of higher thermal conductivity, as compared
to that of the PCM, are in physical contact with each other within
the aggregates with a radius of gyration several times larger than
that of the individual nanoinclusions.22 Formation of larger aggregates (but within the limit of well-dispersed
aggregates) is beneficial for thermal conductivity enhancement of
the nanoinclusion-loaded PCM primarily due to three reasons, viz.,
phonon-mediated efficient heat conduction through a larger network
of percolating structure, reduced interfacial thermal resistance due
to improved contact between the nanoinclusions within an aggregate,
and increased near-field radiative heat transfer between the closely
packed nanoinclusions with interparticle separation lower than the
typical dimensions of the individual nanoinclusions.22,23,27

The aggregates or clusters
have fractal morphologies consisting of a backbone and dead ends.22 The backbone is a quasi-continuous network of
percolating nanoinclusions, spanning the entire aggregate volume with
characteristic length scale equal to the radius of gyration of the
aggregate. On the other hand, the randomly placed nanoinclusions form
dead ends within the aggregates.22 Under
such a scenario, the effective thermal conductivity of a cluster is
attributed to two different sources, viz., the thermal conductivity
of the homogenized medium with dead ends alone (first-level homogenization)
and superimposition of the backbone over this homogenized medium (second-level
homogenization).25 Finally, the effective
thermal conductivity of the entire system is obtained from homogenization
of the clusters with the medium (third level of homogenization).25

Let k, kf, kde, kp, and kc indicate the effective
thermal conductivity
of the nanoinclusion-loaded PCM (entire system), thermal conductivity
of the PCM in liquid state, thermal conductivity of the cluster with
dead ends alone, total thermal conductivity of the cluster, and bulk
thermal conductivity of the nanoinclusions, respectively. Then according
to the Bruggeman model, the thermal conductivity of the cluster with
dead ends alone can be expressed by the following equation22,25 2  Here, ϕde indicates the volume
fraction of the nanoinclusions belonging to the dead ends alone and
ϕde = ϕc – ϕbb, where ϕc and ϕbb indicate the
volume fraction of the nanoinclusion within a cluster and the volume
fraction of nanoinclusions belonging to the backbone, respectively.25Section S1, in the
Supporting Information, describes the calculations of ϕbb, ϕde, and ϕc in terms
of the fractal dimension of the clusters. The total thermal conductivity
of the clusters (kc) is estimated with
an assumption that the backbone is superimposed on a medium with homogenized
thermal conductivity kde.2525 The total thermal conductivity
of the cluster is obtained from the following equation originally
proposed by Nan et al.28 3  Here L33 = 1 –
2L11, where L11 = 0.5m2/(m2 – 1) – 0.5m cosh–1[m(m2 – 1)−1.5] and m is the aspect ratio of
the cluster with respect to the nanoinclusions, defined as m = Rg/a, where Rg and a indicate the radius of gyration of the
cluster and size of the nanoinclusions, respectively.28 The term βii (i = 1 and 3) is expressed by the following equations28 4   5  Here ω = (2 + 1/m)
× (δR/a), where δR indicates the hypothetical Kaptiza radius, which signifies
the length scale in the host matrix over which the temperature drop
is comparable to the temperature drop at the nanoinclusion/host interface.25,28 Finally, the effective thermal conductivity of the entire sample
(nanoinclusion-loaded PCM) is obtained from the Maxwell-Garnett model
using the following equation25 6  Nanoinclusion-aided enhancement in the thermal
conductivity of the PCM is calculated from eq 6 in the liquid state. However, thermal conductivity
enhancement drastically increases in the solid state and during the
liquid–solid phase transition, which is attributed to the squeezing
of nanoinclusions toward the grain boundaries, as explained in the
following section.

Network of Clusters in Solid State
When crystal-forming
liquids are loaded with nanoinclusions, the nanoinclusions are driven
toward the intercrystal regions or grain boundaries during freezing.18,20 Internal stress field is generated within the PCM (considering linear
viscoelastic properties) during freezing, which is expressed by the
following relation29 7  Here S(r,t), E(t), e0(τ), T(r,τ), ν, and αl indicate the stress field
at location r and time t, relaxation
modulus function at time t, instantaneous mean strain
at time t = τ, temperature profile at a particular
location (r) at instantaneous time t = τ, Poisson’s ratio, and coefficient of thermal expansion,
respectively.29

The solidification-induced
internal stress squeezes the nanoinclusions toward the grain boundaries
and increases the contact area between the nanoinclusions, thereby
reducing the thermal contact resistance (Kapitza resistance), which
results in an enhancement in the thermal conductivity of the nanoinclusion-loaded
PCM due to the formation of a quasi-2D network of percolation pathways
with a high heat-transfer efficiency.7,18,19,22,30Figure 1 schematically
shows the solidification-induced formation of a 2D network of percolating
structures with enhanced heat-transfer properties.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the solidification-induced formation
of a 2D network of percolating structures with enhanced heat-transfer
properties. In the liquid state (left figure), the clusters are randomly
dispersed. During phase transition (middle figure), needlelike structures
develop and the clusters experience a stress field, which drives them
toward the grain boundaries. The formation of a quasi-2D percolating
network is complete in the solid state (right figure), which causes
a large enhancement in thermal conductivity. The inset shows the expanded
view of a cluster, where the backbones and dead ends consisting of
individual nanoinclusions are seen. Thermal conductivity enhancement
within a cluster is primarily through phonon-mediated heat transfer
via the interconnected backbones, which span the entire length of
a cluster.

Domingues et al.27 proposed that stress-induced
squeezing of the nanoinclusions also leads to substantially lower
interparticle separation distances, as compared to the typical dimensions
of the nanoinclusions, which results in an enhancement of near-field
radiative heat transfer.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the
Nanoinclusions
Section S2, in
the Supporting Information, describes
the characterization results for the nanoinclusions in detail. Only
the essential features are discussed below. From transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image analyses, the average sizes of NiNP and CuNP
were obtained as ∼23.4 ± 2.3 and 12.8 ± 2.8 nm, respectively.
The room temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicated
the presence of face-centered cubic (FCC) Ni (JCPDS 04-0850)31 and FCC elemental Cu (JCPDS 71-4610)32 phases, and the average crystallite sizes were
found to be ∼29 ± 3 and 13 ± 2 nm for NiNP and CuNP,
respectively, which were in good agreement with the sizes obtained
from TEM. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies33 indicated the most probable sizes of CBNP and GNP as ∼21
± 2 and ∼12 ± 2 nm, respectively. Analyses of the
scattering intensity at a high q (wave vector) region,
i.e., Porod’s region,33 indicated
the fractal dimension of GNP, which was in agreement with the earlier
reported results.6,34 The average hydrodynamic sizes
were 295 ± 59, 296 ± 82, and 615 ± 141 nm for NiNP,
CuNP, and CBNP, respectively, which were significantly higher than
the sizes obtained from XRD, TEM, and SAXS. This indicated significant
aggregation of the nanoinclusions on dispersion in hexadecane. The
larger hydrodynamic size of CBNP nanoinclusions was attributed to
the formation of aciniform aggregates of the primary particles (nodules).35 In the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra,
the strong absorption band, at 1716 cm–1, for the
pure oleic acid, corresponding to the stretching of the carbonyl group,36 was missing for the oleic acid-capped nanoinclusions,
where two new absorption bands appeared at 1667 and 1598 cm–1, which corresponded to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of
−COO–, respectively.37 The difference between the symmetric and asymmetric bands was found
to be ∼69 cm–1, indicating the formation
of chelating bidentate on the surface of the nanoinclusions, upon
coating with oleic acid due to strong electronic interaction of the
polar carboxylic head group of oleic acid with the nanoinclusions.37 FTIR spectra confirmed that the major absorption
bands were not shifted for the PCM loaded with various nanoinclusions,36−38 which clearly indicated the absence of any chemical reaction between
the PCM and the nanoinclusions.

Characterization of the
PCM
Figure 2a shows the heat flow curves, during solidification
and melting of the PCM (hexadecane), obtained from differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) studies. The solidification (Ts) and melting (Tm) temperatures
were found to be 14.5 and 19.3 °C, respectively. These values
are in good agreement with the phase transition temperature of ∼17–18
°C reported by Vélez et al.,10 Sun et al.,19 Zheng et al,18 and Su et al.13 The
latent heat values were found to be ∼238.6 and 241.4 kJ kg–1 during solidification and melting, respectively,
which were also in agreement with the values reported elsewhere (∼236
kJ kg–1 by Vélez et al.,10 ∼238 kJ kg–1 by Su et al.,13 etc.). The degree of supercooling (difference
between Ts and Tm) was found to be ∼4.8 °C, which was higher than
the value of ∼1 °C reported by Vélez et al.10Figure 2b shows the variation of refractive index of the PCM as a
function of temperature during solidification and melting. Table S2, in the Supporting Information, shows
the experimental data for variation of refractive index, as a function
of temperature. It can be seen from Figure 2b that refractive index increased with decreasing
temperature up to the phase transition temperature of the PCM and
beyond that refractive index decreased. Due to absorption and re-emission
of light along the traveling path, speed of light in a medium is lower
than that in a vacuum. With decreasing temperature, the density of
the PCM increases, leading to a decreased speed of light in the medium,
resulting in an increase in refractive index. The phase transition
temperature of the PCM was found to be ∼17 °C, which was
in agreement with the results obtained from differential scanning
calorimetry studies. It can be further seen from Figure 2b that the refractive index
decreased sharply below the phase transition temperature, which was
attributed to the cracking of the solidified pellets, which allowed
the light to pass through. Extensive cracking of the solidified pellets
was observed due to the formation of a needlelike microstructure after
freezing.18,19 The insets of Figure 2b show the photograph of the PCM in the liquid
and solid states and the presence of a needlelike microstructure and
cracks in the solidified pellet is clearly discernible from the photographs. Figure 2c shows the variation
of k/kf as a function
of temperature for the PCM. Here, k and kf indicate the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity
of the PCM and the thermal conductivity of the PCM at T = 25 °C (=0.140 ± 0.002 W m–1 K–1), respectively. The percentage enhancement in thermal
conductivity [=100 × (k – kf)/kf] is also shown in Figure 2c. Table S3, in the Supporting Information, shows the experimental
data for variation of thermal conductivity and k/kf as a function of temperature. The thermal
conductivity enhancement was insignificant in the liquid state, whereas
significant enhancement in thermal conductivity was observed in the
phase transition region and solid state. In the solid state, thermal
conductivity decreased slightly with decreasing temperature but remained
constant below 10 °C. The thermal conductivity of the PCM in
the solid state, at T = 10 °C, was found to
be 0.249 (±0.003) W m–1 K–1, which was slightly higher than the earlier reported value of 0.21
W m–1 K–1.13 The increase in thermal conductivity in the solid state
was attributed to the formation of a closely packed nanocrystalline
structure. A similar enhancement in thermal conductivity in the solid
state has been experimentally reported by Sun et al.19 and Zheng et al.18 for n-hexadecane. Using molecular dynamics simulation, Babaei
et al.39 confirmed the formation of a nanocrystalline
phase during solidification of PCM, which caused an enhancement in
thermal conductivity due to the phonon-mediated heat transfer. It
has been reported that hexadecane crystals exhibit strong anisotropic
growth kinetics, resulting in the formation of a needlelike microstructure
and ice templating.18−20 The inset of Figure 2c shows a phase contrast optical micrograph of hexadecane
in the solid state, where the presence of needlelike microstructures
is clearly discernible (indicated by the arrows). For establishing
repeatability and thermal stability of the PCM, thermal cycling was
carried out and five thermal conductivity measurements were performed
at regular time intervals in the solid (at T = 10
°C) and liquid (at T = 25 °C) states. Figure 2d shows the variation
of k/kf during thermal
cycling of the PCM, where it can be seen that freezing and melting
cycles were reversible, even after four cycles. The k/kf in the solid state (at T = 10 °C) was ∼1.779, indicating a thermal conductivity
enhancement of 77.9% for the PCM, which was significantly higher than
the earlier reported values of ∼28% by Sun et al.19 and ∼50% by Su et al.13 The observed reversible thermal cycles indicated the superior
thermal stability and efficacy of hexadecane-based PCM for thermal
energy storage applications.

conductivity of the PCM and the thermal conductivity of the PCM at T = 25 °C (=0.140 ± 0.002 W m–1 K–1), respectively. The variation of k/kf can be divided into three regions,
viz., region-I (liquid state), region-II (phase transition), and region-III
(solid state). (Inset) optical phase contrast microscopy image of
the PCM in solid state, where the needlelike microstructure is clearly

Nanoinclusion-Assisted Thermal Conductivity
Enhancement of the
PCM
Figure 3a–f shows the variation of k/kf and percentage (%) enhancement in thermal conductivity,
as a function of temperature, for the PCM loaded with various concentrations
of CBNP, NiNP, CuNP, AgNW, MWCNT, and GNP nanoinclusions, respectively. Tables S4–S9, in the Supporting Information,
show the experimental data for the variations of thermal conductivity
and k/kf as a function
of temperature for the PCM loaded with various concentrations of CBNP,
NiNP, CuNP, AgNW, MWCNT, and GNP, respectively. For comparison, the
variation of k/kf in
the case of PCM without any nanoinclusions is also shown in the figures.
It can be clearly seen from Figure 3a–f that the variation of k/kf as a function of temperature can
be divided into three distinct regions, which were indicated as regions
I, II, and III, respectively. For T > 18.3 °C,
the PCM, with or without nanoinclusions, was found to be in the liquid
state, and this region was categorized as region-I. Region-II indicated
the phase transition region for 14.5 °C < T < 18.3 °C, and region-III corresponded to the temperature
range well below the freezing point, where the PCM, with or without
nanoinclusions, was in the solid state.

Figure 3 Variation of k/kf and
percentage enhancement in thermal conductivity, as a function of temperature,
for the PCM loaded with various concentrations of (a) CBNP, (b) NiNP,
(c) CuNP, (d) AgNW, (e) MWCNT, and (f) GNP nanoinclusions. For comparison,
the variation of k/kf in the case of PCM, without any nanoinclusions, is also shown in
the figures. The variation of k/kf can be divided into three regions, viz., region-I (liquid
state), region-II (phase transition), and region-III (solid state).

Figure 3a shows
that the thermal conductivity enhancements in the liquid state (at T = 25 °C) were ∼1.4, 5.0, 5.5, 5.5, and 6.4%
for 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % CBNP loading, respectively. Figure S4a, in the Supporting Information, shows
the enlarged view of the variation of k/kf and percentage enhancement in thermal conductivity,
as a function of temperature, for the PCM loaded with various concentrations
of CBNP, in the liquid state. In the phase transition region (region-II),
maximum enhancements of thermal conductivity were ∼260, 267,
339, 293, and 300% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075,
and 0.01 wt % CBNP, respectively. Figure 3a further shows that the thermal conductivity
enhancement decreased with temperature in the solid state (region-III)
and attained a steady value below 10 °C. In the solid state,
thermal conductivity enhancements were ∼87.9, 105.0, 117.4,
115.5, and 121.4% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075,
and 0.01 wt % CBNP, respectively. Figure S5a, in the Supporting Information, shows the enlarged view of the variation
of k/kf and percentage
enhancement in thermal conductivity, as a function of temperature,
for the PCM loaded with various concentrations of CBNP, in the solid
state.

The higher thermal conductivity in the solid state (region-III)
as compared to that in the liquid state (region-I) was due to the
formation of a crystalline structure of the PCM after freezing and
phonon-assisted efficient heat transfer in the solid state.18,19 The maximum enhancement in thermal conductivity was observed in
the phase transition region, which was attributed to the strong anisotropic
growth kinetics-induced formation of a continuous networking structure
during liquid–solid phase transition in hexadecane.17−19 The formation of such needlelike microstructures during liquid–solid
phase transition has been reported experimentally.17−20 Schiffres et al.20 reported that a slower cooling rate results in the formation
of a microstructure with thicker and longer needles, leading to a
comparatively larger thermal conductivity enhancement due to anisotropic
templating. Zheng et al.18 mapped the internal
stress distribution in frozen hexadecane and reported an uneven stress
distribution with an average pressure of ∼160 psi, which was
attributed to the anisotropic growth kinetics and formation of a needlelike
microstructure in frozen hexadecane. The formation of needlelike microstructures
during liquid–solid phase transition of hexadecane is also
confirmed in the present study from optical phase contrast microscopy
images (inset of Figure 2c). During freezing, due to internal stress fields, the nanoinclusions
are driven toward the intercrystal regions or grain boundaries.18,20,29 This results in an enhancement
in the thermal conductivity of the nanoinclusion-loaded PCM due to
the formation of a quasi-2D network of percolation pathways with high
heat-transfer efficiency.7−19,22,30 Increased near-field radiative heat transfer due to low interparticle
separation distance (spatially localized near the grain boundaries)
also leads to an enhancement of thermal conductivity.27 On the other hand, the lowering of thermal conductivity
enhancements in region-III, well below the freezing point, was attributed
to the microstructural changes, where longer needles were broken down
to shorter needles, probably due to the solidification-induced residual
stress fields.18,29

It can be seen from Figure 3b that in region-I,
thermal conductivity enhancements were
∼2.1, 4.3, 5.7, 5.0, and 2.1% for the PCM loaded with 0.001,
0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % NiNPs, respectively. Figure S4b, in the Supporting Information, shows
the enlarged view of the variation of k/kf and percentage increase in thermal conductivity, as
a function of temperature, for the PCM loaded with various concentrations
of NiNPs, in the liquid state. In the phase transition region, the
maximum enhancements in thermal conductivity were ∼248, 273,
313, 316, and 310% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075,
and 0.01 wt % NiNPs, respectively. In region-III, the enhancements
in thermal conductivity were ∼85.7, 102.1, 112.9, 101.4, and
102.9% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01
wt % NiNPs, respectively. Figure S5b, in
the Supporting Information, shows the enlarged view of variation of k/kf and percentage enhancement
in thermal conductivity, as a function of temperature, for the PCM
loaded with various concentrations of NiNPs, in the solid state. Figure 3c shows the variation
of k/kf and percentage
enhancement in thermal conductivity, as a function of temperature
for the PCM loaded with CuNP, where it can be seen that the enhancements
in thermal conductivity in the liquid state were ∼2.9, 5.7,
9.3, 10.0, and 11.4% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005,
0.0075, and 0.01 wt % CuNPs, respectively. Thermal conductivity enhancements
in the phase transition region were ∼301, 231, 221, 283, and
348% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01
wt % CuNPs, respectively. On the other hand, in region-III, thermal
conductivity enhancements (at T = 10 °C) were
∼85.5, 87.9, 100.7, 102.9, and 117.1% for the PCM loaded with
0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % CuNPs, respectively. Thermal
conductivity enhancements for CuNP-loaded PCM were found to be higher
than the earlier reported values of ∼3 and 182% enhancement
in the liquid and phase transition regions, respectively, for hexadecane
loaded with 0.01 wt % copper nanowires (outer diameter and length
∼50 nm and 1–50 μm, respectively).17 On the other hand, in the solid state, the thermal
conductivity enhancement was higher (∼130%) in the case of
PCM loaded with 0.01 wt % copper nanowires17 as compared to that with CuNP nanoinclusions used in the present
study (maximum enhancement ∼117.1%). This was probably due
to the higher aspect ratio of the copper nanowires that formed efficient
percolating trajectories along the grain boundaries during freezing.

Figure 3d shows
that the thermal conductivity enhancements, in the liquid state, were
∼2.9, 7.1, 2.9, 8.6, and 9.3% for the PCM loaded with 0.001,
0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % AgNWs, respectively. In region-II,
thermal conductivity enhancements were ∼382, 337, 326, 287,
and 348% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and
0.01 wt % AgNWs, respectively. On the other hand, 87.9, 117.1, 129.3,
102.1, and 117.9% enhancements in thermal conductivity were observed
in the solid state (at T = 10 °C) for AgNW loading
of 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt %, respectively. Figure 3e shows the variation
of thermal conductivity enhancement for the PCM loaded with MWCNTs,
where it can be seen that the thermal conductivity enhancements in
the liquid state were ∼1.4, 2.9, 4.3, 5.0, and 5.7% for the
PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % MWCNT.
Thermal conductivity enhancements in the phase transition region were
∼238, 264, 273, 274, and 209% for the PCM loaded with 0.001,
0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % MWCNTs, respectively. In the
solid state, thermal conductivity enhancements were ∼80.0,
85.0, 87.9, 105.0, and 87.9% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025,
0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % MWCNTs. In the present study, the maximum
thermal conductivity enhancement in the solid state (at T = 10 °C) was ∼105% for the PCM loaded with 0.0075 wt
% MWCNT, which was lower than the ∼200% enhancement in thermal
conductivity reported by Sun et al.19 for
hexadecane loaded with carboxylic acid-functionalized MWCNTs (loading
= 0.4% volume fraction). On the other hand, our results indicated
a maximum enhancement in thermal conductivity of ∼274% for
the PCM loaded with 0.0075 wt % MWCNTs in the phase transition region,
which was substantially higher than the values reported by Sun et
al.19 It can be seen from Figure 3f that the thermal conductivity
enhancements in the liquid state were ∼1.4, 2.9, 4.3, 5.7,
and 7.1% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and
0.01 wt % GNP, respectively. Thermal conductivity enhancements in
the phase transition region were ∼257, 263, 271, 278, and 282%
for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt
% GNP, respectively. Thermal conductivity enhancements of ∼84.3,
91.4, 100.0, 107.1, and 111.4% were observed for the PCM loaded with
0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % GNP, respectively, in
the solid state. The maximum enhancement in thermal conductivity in
the phase transition region was found to be ∼282% for the PCM
loaded with 0.01 wt % GNP, which was higher than the enhancement values
of ∼220 and 110–160% reported by Zheng et al.18 and Schiffres et al.,20 respectively. Figures S4c–f and S5c–f, in the Supporting Information, show the enlarged views of the variation
of k/kf and percentage
enhancements in thermal conductivity as a function of temperature
for the PCM loaded with various concentrations of CuNPs, AgNWs, MWCNTs,
and GNPs in the liquid and solid states, respectively.

Figure 4a–f
shows the variation of k/kf and percentage enhancement in thermal conductivity as a function
of sample concentration in the solid (T = 10 °C)
and liquid (T = 25 °C) states for the PCM loaded
with six different nanoinclusions, viz., CBNP, NiNP, CuNP, AgNW, MWCNT,
and GNP. In the liquid state, maximum enhancements in thermal conductivity
were ∼6.4, 5.7, 11.4, 9.3, 5.7, and 7.1% for the PCM loaded
with 0.01 wt % CBNP, 0.005 wt % NiNPs, 0.01 wt % CuNPs, 0.01 wt %
AgNWs, 0.01 wt % MWCNTs, and 0.01 wt % GNPs, respectively. It can
be clearly seen from Figure 4 that for the PCM loaded with CBNP, CuNPs, MWCNTs, and GNPs,
thermal conductivity increased with the concentration of the nanoinclusions
in the liquid state. On the other hand, for the PCM loaded with NiNPs
and AgNWs, thermal conductivity decreased at higher concentrations
of the nanoinclusions, which was due to the sedimentation of the larger
aggregates at higher concentrations of the nanoinclusions. The sedimentation
velocity (Vs) of a concentrated solution
is expressed as .21 Here M and ϕ indicate a numerical constant (M ∼ 4.6) and effective volume fraction of the solute, respectively. V0 indicates the sedimentation velocity at infinite
dilution, which is linearly proportional to the density difference
of the solute and the solvent.21 Due to
higher density of AgNW and NiNP (density ∼10.5 and 8.9 g cc–1, respectively), these nanoinclusions were prone to
form unstable aggregates at higher concentrations, which resulted
in the decrease of thermal conductivity enhancements at higher concentrations,
as can be seen from Figure 4b,d.

Figure 4 Variation of k/kf and
percentage enhancement in thermal conductivity as a function of sample
concentration in the solid (T = 10 °C) and liquid
(T = 25 °C) states for the PCM loaded with (a)
CBNP, (b) NiNP, (c) CuNP, (d) AgNW, (e) MWCNT, and (f) GNP nanoinclusions.

It can be further seen from Figure 4a–f that the
thermal conductivity enhancement
was substantially higher for the nanoinclusion-loaded PCM in the solid
state, which was attributed to the formation of the crystalline structure
of the PCM on freezing and phonon-mediated efficient heat transfer
through the quasi-2D network of percolating structures.17−19 In the present study, the maximum thermal conductivity enhancements
in the solid state were ∼121.4, 112.9, 117.1, 129.3, 105.0,
and 111.4% for the PCM loaded with 0.01 wt % CBNP, 0.005 wt % NiNPs,
0.01 wt % CuNPs, 0.005 wt % AgNWs, 0.0075 wt % MWCNTs, and 0.01 wt
% GNPs, respectively. The aggregates grow in size with the increasing
concentration of the nanoinclusions due to van der Waals interaction,
resulting in an enhancement of thermal conductivity. As discussed
earlier in the theoretical section, the formation of such larger aggregates
is beneficial for thermal conductivity enhancement due to phonon-mediated
efficient heat conduction through a larger network of percolating
structure with reduced interfacial thermal resistance and increased
near-field radiative heat transfer.22,23,27 Initial increase in thermal conductivity enhancement
of the nanoinclusion-loaded PCM with increasing loading fraction has
also been reported earlier for hexadecane-based PCM.17−19Figure S6a–f, in the Supporting
Information, shows the variation of k/kf in the liquid state as a function of concentration (in
volume fraction) for the PCM loaded with CBNP, NiNP, CuNP, AgNW, MWCNT,
and GNP nanoinclusions, respectively. The theoretical plots for the
effective medium theory (k/kf = 1 + 3ϕ, ϕ being the effective volume fraction
of the nanoinclusions, which is considered as the theoretical upper
limit of eq 6 after three-level
homogenization following the Prasher and Evans model25) are also shown in the figures. It can be clearly seen
from Figure S6a–f that the experimentally
measured k/kf values
were higher than the theoretically predicted values, which indicated
the presence of agglomeration in these systems.4,17

It has been reported that the thermal conductivity of nanofluids
initially increases with the aggregate size and attains an optimal
value for the well-dispersed aggregates due to the formation of a
high-efficiency percolation network and beyond that thermal conductivity
decreases for larger aggregates.22 The
formation of such large aggregates causes a saturation or a slight
decrease in thermal conductivity enhancements at higher concentrations
of the nanoinclusions, as can be seen from Figure 4a–f. This was attributed to the fractal
morphologies of the aggregates consisting of a backbone and dead ends,
as discussed earlier in the theoretical section and schematically
shown in Figure 1.25 Thermal conductivity enhancement occurs via
phonon-mediated effective heat transport through the backbone, and
the dead ends are, in general, insignificant toward enhancement of
thermal transport.22 This is also evident
from eq 2 (after first-order
homogenization involving dead ends only), where considering the highest
volume fraction as 7.33 × 10–6 for 0.01 wt
% loading of AgNWs and thermal conductivities of Ag and PCM (in solid
state) as 4274 and 0.249 W m–1 K–1, respectively, the effective thermal conductivity
of AgNW-loaded PCM was found to be ∼0.252 W m–1 K–1. This shows that if the contributions from
only dead ends are considered, the maximum thermal conductivity enhancement
is ∼1.2%, which was approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower
than the experimentally measured value of ∼120%. In larger
aggregates, the number of dead ends increases, which does not contribute
toward thermal conductivity enhancement, and moreover, such larger
aggregates are not well dispersed and prone to sedimentation, causing
a saturation or decrease in thermal conductivity of the nanoinclusion-loaded
PCM at higher loading fractions. A decrease in thermal conductivity
for higher concentrations of MWCNT loading in hexadecane-based PCM
was experimentally reported by Angayarkanni and Philip17 and Sun et al.,19 which is in good agreement with the findings of the present study.

The six different nanoinclusions used in the present study were
classified into two groups, viz., carbon-based nanoinclusions (CBNP,
GNP, and MWCNT) and metallic nanoinclusions (AgNW, CuNP, and NiNP). Figure 5a,b shows the bar
charts comparing the k/kf and percentage enhancement in thermal conductivity in the solid
state at a loading concentration of 0.01 wt % for the carbon-based
and metallic nanoinclusions, respectively. For comparison, the thermal
conductivity enhancement of the PCM (without any nanoinclusions) is
also shown in Figure 5a,b. Among the three carbon-based nanoinclusions, bulk thermal conductivity
is the highest for MWCNTs (∼6600 W m–1 K–1), followed by GNPs (∼3000 W m–1 K–1) and CBNP (∼0.25–0.4 W m–1 K–1).4 Nevertheless, it can be clearly seen from Figure 5a that the highest enhancement in thermal
conductivity was for the PCM loaded with CBNP, followed by GNPs and
MWCNTs, in the decreasing order. This was attributed to the variations
in morphology and Kapitza resistance of the nanoinclusions. For the
nanoinclusion-loaded PCM in the solid state, the enhancement in thermal
conductivity is due to the formation of percolation trajectories along
the intercrystallite regions, and GNP, being two-dimensional, forms
better percolation pathways with comparatively larger networking structures.40 Using molecular dynamics simulations, Yang et
al.41 showed that carbon nanotubes and
graphene nanoplatelets act as nucleation sites during freezing, which
leads to orientational ordering near the PCM/nanoinclusions interface,
resulting in an enhanced phonon coupling.40 It was further shown by Yang et al.41 that the nucleation rate is lower for the PCM loaded with GNP. In
the case of hexadecane-based PCM, a lower freezing rate leads to the
formation of a longer and thicker needlelike microstructure with improved
heat-transfer efficiency.20 The higher
thermal conductivity enhancement in the case of PCM loaded with GNPs
was also attributed to the lower Kapitza resistance of GNP, as compared
to that of MWCNT.40 On the other hand,
the PCM loaded with CBNP nanoinclusions showed the highest thermal
conductivity enhancement, which was attributed to the fractal nature
of the aggregates of CBNP, consisting of nodules of primary particles.
An earlier study showed that CBNP loading in PCM leads to the formation
of high thermal conductivity percolation trajectories with reduced
interaggregate gaps.42 The higher thermal
conductivity for CBNP-loaded octadecane-based PCM was reported by
Wu et al.,43 which was attributed to the
low fractal dimensions and volume-filling capability of the CBNP aggregates.
Thermal conductivity enhancement through the percolating network of
the nanoinclusions loaded within a PCM is limited due to the interfacial
thermal resistance of the aggregate/aggregate and aggregate/PCM interfaces
and phonon mismatch due to the random curvatures of the aggregate/aggregate
interfaces.44,45 CBNP, due to its aciniform structure
and low fractal dimension, forms tightly packed aggregates with improved
aggregate/aggregate interactions, leading to higher-thermal-conductivity
trajectories, which explains the highest thermal conductivity enhancement
for the PCM loaded with CBNP, as shown in Figure 5a.

Figure 5 Bar charts comparing the k/kf and percentage enhancement in thermal conductivity
in the
solid state at a loading concentration of 0.01 wt % for the (a) carbon-based
and (b) metallic nanoinclusions. For comparison, the thermal conductivity
enhancement of the PCM, without any nanoinclusions, is also shown
in the figures. Variation of k/kf and percentage enhancement in thermal conductivity during
thermal cycling for the PCM loaded with 0.005 wt % (c) CBNP and (d)
AgNWs.

On the other hand, it is evident
from Figure 5b that
in the case of metallic nanoinclusions
the highest thermal conductivity enhancement was obtained for the
PCM loaded with AgNWs, followed by CuNPs and NiNPs, in the decreasing
order. Among the three metallic nanoinclusions, bulk thermal conductivity
is the highest for AgNWs (∼427 W m–1 K–1) followed by CuNPs (∼385 W m–1 K–1) and NiNPs (∼91 W m–1 K–1).4 Although the
thermal conductivity enhancements for the PCM loaded with metallic
nanoinclusions showed a similar trend, other physical factors, viz.,
larger aspect ratio of AgNW and larger size of NiNP (average crystallite
sizes of NiNP and CuNP were ∼29 ± 3 and 13 ± 2 nm,
respectively) also played a significant role according to earlier
studies,46 which showed a higher thermal
conductivity enhancement for lower particle size and larger aspect
ratios of the dispersed phase. On the other hand, an increase in the
effective thermal conductivity of the PCM loaded with metallic nanoinclusions
as a function of the bulk thermal conductivity of the nanoinclusions
suggested a series or parallel ordering, under aggregation in these
systems.47Figure S7a,b, in the Supporting Information, shows the bar charts comparing the
thermal conductivity enhancements in the liquid state for the PCM
loaded with carbon-based and metallic nanoinclusions, respectively.
It can be seen from Figure S7a,b that the
thermal conductivity enhancements were not significant in the liquid
state, which was in agreement with the observations made from Figures 3 and S4.

Figure 5c,d shows
the results of thermal cycling for the PCM loaded with 0.005 wt %
CBNP and AgNWs, respectively. During thermal cycling, several thermal
conductivity measurements were performed in the liquid state (at T = 25 °C, well above the freezing point), then the
samples were frozen well below the phase transition temperature, and
several thermal conductivity measurements were performed in the solid
state (at T = 10 °C). In the case of pure PCM
(without any nanoinclusions), the melting and freezing cycles were
perfectly reversible (as can be seen from Figure 2d), whereas some deviations were observed
for the PCM loaded with 0.005 wt % CBNP and AgNWs. In the case of
PCM loaded with CBNP, thermal conductivity enhancements in the liquid
state were ∼7.0, 6.0, 4.0, and 3.0% after first, second, third,
and fourth cycles, respectively. On the other hand, thermal conductivity
enhancements in the solid state were ∼117.4, 155.7, 150.0,
and 148.6% after first, second, third, and fourth cycles, respectively.
In the case of the PCM loaded with AgNWs, thermal conductivity enhancements
in the liquid state were ∼5.0, 2.9, 2.9, and 2.9% after first,
second, third, and fourth cycles, respectively. In the solid state,
for the PCM loaded with AgNWs, thermal conductivity enhancements were
∼129.3, 141.4, 145.0, and 142.9% after first, second, third,
and fourth cycles, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 5c,d that the variations in
thermal conductivity enhancements, during thermal cycling, were negligible
in the liquid state but significant in the solid state. This was attributed
to the difference in aggregate sizes and aggregate numbers after subsequent
melting/freezing cycles. The individual nanoinclusions form aggregates
due to van der Waals interaction, and after subsequent thermal cycles,
the aggregates do not redisperse reversibly.19 Phase contrast optical microscopy studies were carried out to ascertain
the microstructural evolution after subsequent thermal cycles, and Figure 6a–d shows
the optical phase contrast microscopy images for the PCM loaded with
0.005 wt % CBNP after first, second, third, and fourth cycles, respectively,
in the liquid sate. The formation of micron-sized aggregates of CBNP
(encircled in the figure for better visualization) after the second
freezing cycle is clearly discernible from Figure 6b, which resulted in a larger thermal conductivity
enhancement in the second cycle (as can be seen from Figure 5c). On the other hand, Figure 6c clearly shows that
after the third thermal cycle, larger aggregates were formed with
lower number density, which caused a slight decrease in thermal conductivity
enhancement in the third thermal cycle (thermal conductivity enhancement
∼150.0% at the third cycle, against ∼155.7% after the
second cycle). Figure 6d shows the phase contrast microscopy image after the fourth cycle,
where lower number of aggregates were visible, as larger aggregates
were prone to sedimentation, causing a further decrease in thermal
conductivity enhancement in the fourth cycle, as can be seen from Figure 5c.

Figure 6 Optical phase contrast
microscopy images for the PCM loaded with
0.005 wt % CBNP after (a) first, (b) second, (c) third, and (d) fourth
cycles in the liquid sate. The formation of micron-sized aggregates
of CBNP are clearly discernible from the images. A few aggregates
are encircled in the figures for easy identification.

Figure 7a–c
shows the results of thermal cycling for the PCM loaded with 0.005
wt % MWCNTs, NiNPs, and CuNPs, respectively. In the case of the PCM
loaded with MWCNTs, thermal conductivity enhancements in the liquid
state were ∼2.1, 2.9, 1.4, and 0.0% after first, second, third,
and fourth cycles, respectively. On the other hand, thermal conductivity
enhancements in the solid state were ∼87.9, 112.1, 96.4, and
89.3% after first, second, third, and fourth cycles, respectively.
For the PCM loaded with NiNP nanoinclusions, thermal conductivity
enhancements were ∼4.3, 8.6, 5.7, and 5.5% after first, second,
third, and fourth cycles, respectively, in the liquid state and 112.9,
117.1, 124.3, and 125.2% after first, second, third, and fourth cycles,
respectively, in the solid state. For CuNP nanoinclusion-loaded PCM,
thermal conductivity enhancements in the liquid state were ∼3.6,
2.1, 2.9, and 2.1% after first, second, third, and fourth cycles,
respectively. Thermal conductivity enhancements in the solid state
were ∼100.7, 121.4, 134.3, and 132.1% after first, second,
third, and fourth cycles, respectively. The variations in the thermal
conductivity enhancements in the solid state during thermal cycling
were attributed to the irreversible aggregation dynamics after subsequent
melting/freezing cycles. A similar variation in thermal conductivity
enhancements was reported for hexadecane-based PCM loaded with MWCNTs
and graphite suspensions by Sun et al.,19 Zheng et al.,18 and Angayarkanni and
Philip,17 where the variations were attributed
to irreversible aggregation dynamics and weak solid–fluid interaction
induced negative thermal conductivity enhancement for positive Kapitza
lengths.

percentage enhancement in thermal conductivity during thermal cycling

nanoinclusions.

Effect of Surface Functionalization
on Thermal Conductivity
Enhancement
To study the effect of surface functionalization
on thermal conductivity enhancement, experiments were performed using
uncoated graphene nanoplatelet (GNP-UC)-loaded PCM. Figure 8a shows the variation of k/kf and percentage enhancement
in thermal conductivity as a function of temperature for the PCM loaded
with five different concentrations (viz., 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075,
and 0.01 wt %) of GNP-UC. For comparison, thermal conductivity variation
of the PCM (without any nanoinclusion) is also shown in Figure 8a. Table S10, in the Supporting Information, shows the experimental
data for the variation of thermal conductivity and k/kf as a function of temperature. It
can be clearly seen from Figure 8a that the variation of k/kf as a function of temperature can be divided
into three regions, viz., region-I (liquid state, for T > 18.3 °C), region-II (phase transition region, 14.5 °C
< T < 18.3 °C), and region-III (solid
state, for T < 14.5 °C), which is in agreement
with our earlier observations. Thermal conductivity enhancements in
the liquid state (at T = 25 °C) were ∼0.0,
2.9, 4.3, 7.9, and 5.7% for the PCM loaded with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005,
0.0075, and 0.01 wt % GNPs-UC. In the phase transition region, thermal
conductivity enhancements were ∼300, 283, 279, 280, and 299%
for loading concentrations of 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01
wt %. On the other hand, thermal conductivity enhancements decreased
in the solid state and became constant below 10 °C. Thermal conductivity
enhancements in the solid state (at T = 10 °C)
were ∼82.9, 105.7, 105.7, 121.4, and 89.3% for the PCM loaded
with 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, and 0.01 wt % GNPs-UC. Table 1 shows the comparison
of the k/kf values as
a function of loading concentration for the PCM loaded with GNPs and
GNPs-UC in the liquid and solid states, where it can be seen that
the variation of k/kf in the liquid state is insignificant, whereas in the solid state, k/kf was slightly higher for
the PCM loaded with GNPs-UC. Nevertheless, at the highest concentration
of 0.01 wt %, k/kf, in
the case of GNP-UC, was substantially lower, which was attributed
to the intense agglomeration for the uncoated nanoinclusions.

Figure 8 (a) Variation
of k/kf and percentage
enhancement in thermal conductivity as a function
of temperature for the PCM loaded with five different concentrations
of uncoated GNPs (GNPs-UC). For comparison, thermal conductivity variation
of the PCM, without any nanoinclusion, is also shown in the figure.
The variation of k/kf can be divided into three regions, viz., region-I (liquid state),
region-II (phase transition), and region-III (solid state). (b) Variation
of experimentally measured k/km as a function of theoretically calculated k/km values for the PCM loaded with various
concentrations of oleic acid-functionalized GNPs and uncoated GNPs
(GNPs-UC). Here, km indicates the thermal
conductivity of the PCM, without any inclusions, in the solid state.
The experimental and theoretical data were found to be linearly correlated,
and the linear regression analyses are also shown in the figure. The
errors associated with the theoretical values were less than ±5%.

The presence of an organic coating
on the surface of the GNP increases
the interfacial thermal resistance (Kapitza resistance) of the nanoinclusions,
leading to a lower effective thermal transport efficiency due to phonon
scattering at the nanoinclusion/coating/PCM interfaces, which is partially
specular and partially diffusive depending on the local curvature
and roughness of the interface.48 This
is more evident in the solid state, where the thermal transport is
primarily through the percolating network of the aggregates, which
resulted in comparatively lower thermal conductivity enhancements
for the PCM loaded with oleic acid-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets
(GNPs). Vales-Pinzon et al.49 also reported
an effective decrease in thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol-based
nanofluid containing iron nanoparticles after surface capping with
carbon. On the other hand, Li et al.50 reported
an increase in the thermal conductivity of the water-based SiO2-coated graphene nanofluid, which was attributed to the increased
hydrophilic interaction of silica-coated graphene, resulting in lower
interfacial thermal resistance and larger stability in the aqueous
medium. The significant influence of surface functionalization and
the role of adsorbing moieties on thermal conductivity enhancement
is studied in detail.51,52

Effective thermal conductivity
enhancements in the PCM loaded with
GNPs and GNPs-UC were analyzed using the model proposed by Chu et
al.53Section S3, in the Supporting Information, describes the model and the calculations
in detail. Theoretical values of k/km, in the case of PCM loaded with GNPs and GNPs-UC, were
computed using this model, where the value of RK (interfacial thermal resistance) was considered as 5 ×
10–8 m2 K W–1 for GNP-UC.54 Here, km indicates
the thermal conductivity of the PCM, without any inclusions, in the
solid state. Figure 8b shows the variation of experimentally measured k/km as a function of theoretically calculated k/km values. It can be seen
that the experimentally measured values were linearly correlated with
the theoretical values and the data was fitted with linear regression
analysis. The slope and adjusted R2 for
the linear regression analyses were ∼0.9 ± 0.2 and 0.85,
respectively, indicating quantitative agreement between the experimental
and theoretical values. It can be further seen from Figure 8b that the experimentally measured k/km for the highest loading
concentration of 0.01 wt % was significantly lower than the theoretically
calculated value, which was attributed to the sedimentation of the
large unstable aggregates of GNPs-UC, which was also confirmed from
the optical phase contrast microscopy images, as subsequently discussed.

On the other hand, due to the presence of oleic acid capping on
the surface, the Kapitza resistance of the surface-functionalized
GNP nanoinclusions was expected to be higher, and based on the thermal
conductivity model for coated nanospheres,49 the value was estimated as ∼8 × 10–8 m2 K W–1 (Section S4, in the Supporting Information, describes the calculations
in detail), which was then fitted into the model proposed by Chu et
al.53 to obtain the theoretical values
of k/km for the oleic
acid-coated GNP nanoinclusions. Figure 8b shows the variation of the experimentally measured k/km values as a function of
theoretically calculated k/km values for the PCM loaded with oleic acid-functionalized
GNPs, where it can be seen that the experimental and theoretical values
were linearly correlated. The slope and adjusted R2 of the linear regression analysis were ∼0.8 ±
0.1 and 0.96, respectively, which indicated quantitative agreement
between the calculated and experimental values. It can be further
seen from Figure 8b
that the agreement between the experimental and theoretical values
was superior in the case of the PCM loaded with oleic acid-functionalized
GNPs as compared with the PCM containing uncoated nanoinclusions,
which was attributed to the lower aggregation probability of the former.

Figure 8c,d shows
the results of the thermal cycling for the PCM loaded with 0.005 wt
% GNPs-UC and surface-functionalized GNPs. In the case of PCM loaded
with GNPs-UC, thermal conductivity enhancements in the liquid state
were ∼2.9, 0.7, 0, and 0% after first, second, third, and fourth
cycles, respectively. In the solid state, thermal conductivity enhancements
were 104.3, 112.1, 80, and 77.9% after first, second, third, and fourth
cycles, respectively. On the other hand, in the case of the PCM loaded
with oleic acid-functionalized GNPs, thermal conductivity enhancements
in the liquid state were ∼2.1, 1.4, 0, and 0% after first,
second, third, and fourth cycles, whereas in the solid state, thermal
conductivity enhancements were ∼89.3, 125.0, 121.4, and 110.7%
after first, second, third, and fourth cycles, respectively. It can
be seen from Figure 8c,d that the thermal conductivity enhancements decreased after repeated
thermal cycling, which was attributed to the irreversible aggregation
dynamics during subsequent melting and freezing cycles.19 For the PCM loaded with uncoated GNPs (GNPs-UC),
due to intense aggregation during third and fourth thermal cycles,
a significant decrease in thermal conductivity enhancement was seen.
For increasing domain size in the case of larger aggregates, the acoustic
mismatch model for long-wavelength phonons predicts a lowering of
interfacial heat flux, leading to a reduced effective thermal conductivity.55 Moreover, surface roughness increases with aggregate
size, which leads to enhancement in interfacial scattering of high-frequency
phonons (diffuse mismatch model), leading to an effective lowering
of thermal conductivity for very large aggregates.56

Optical phase contrast microscopy was carried out
on the PCM loaded
with GNPs and GNPs-UC to probe the microstructural evolution during
thermal cycling. Figure 9a–h shows the phase contrast microscopy images for the PCM
loaded with GNPs and GNPs-UC, respectively, in the liquid state, after
first, second, third, and fourth thermal cycles. For the PCM loaded
with GNPs, it can be clearly seen from Figure 9a–d that the size and number density
of the aggregates increased during the second thermal cycle and that
in the case of third and fourth cycles aggregate numbers were nearly
constant. Nevertheless, the number density was the highest during
second cycles and decreased during subsequent cycling due to slight
agglomeration. This resulted in a small decrease in the thermal conductivity
enhancement in the solid state for the PCM loaded with GNPs during
third and fourth cycles, as shown in Figure 8d. On the other hand, it can be seen from Figure 9e–h that for
the PCM loaded with GNPs-UC, intense agglomeration occurred during
third and fourth thermal cycles, resulting in sedimentation of the
larger aggregates, which were not visible in Figure 9h. This caused a large decrease in thermal
conductivity for the PCM loaded with GNPs-UC during third and fourth
thermal cycles, as can be seen from Figure 8c.

aggregates are encircled in the figures for easy identification.

Our studies clearly show that
the presence of a surfactant (oleic
acid) capping on the surface of the GNP increased the stability of
the nanoinclusions, resulting in good thermal stability under cycling,
without significant reduction in thermal conductivity, which is beneficial
for practical applications. The carboxylic acid group of oleic acid
is bound to the surface of the nanoinclusions, whereas the aliphatic
chain is extended into the nonpolar matrix of hexadecane (PCM), which
reduced the aggregation probability of the coated nanoinclusions by
providing additional steric stabilization.57 Similarly, Zeng et al.58 reported a superior
stability of stearic acid-capped MoS2 in cyclohexane, which
was attributed to the extension of the long aliphatic chains of stearic
acid in the organic medium. Moreover, it has been reported that for
surfactant-capped nanoinclusions the thickness of the solvation monolayer
is larger (determined by the chain length of the surfactant as compared
to a few atomic distances in the case of uncoated nanoinclusions),
which enhances the coupling of the nanoinclusions with the host matrix.59 Xia et al.24 also
reported that surfactant capping increased the stability of the nanoinclusions.
They also reported a slight reduction in thermal conductivity for
surface-capped nanoinclusions, especially for surfactants with longer
chain lengths, which was attributed to the increase in Kapitza resistance
upon surface functionalization. These observations are in good agreement
with the experimental findings obtained from the present study.

Infrared-Thermography-Based Studies on the PCM
Infrared-thermography
(IRT)-based studies were carried out to map the surface temperature
distribution of the PCM (with or without nanoinclusions) during freezing,
and the results were compared with the cooling curve of deionized
water. For IRT-based studies, the samples (initial temperature ∼29
°C, i.e., well above the phase transition temperature) were placed
in a recirculating water bath maintained at T = 8
(±0.1) °C and the sample temperature was monitored as a
function of time. Figure 10a–d shows the typical infrared images during cooling
of water at t = 0, 500, 1000, and 1500 s, respectively.
The pseudo-color-coded temperature scale is also shown along with
the images. Figure 10e–h shows the typical infrared images during freezing of the
PCM (without any nanoinclusions) at t = 0, 500, 1000,
and 1500 s, respectively. The infrared images were emissivity-corrected
to reflect the correct temperature of the sample. Figure 10 shows that the sample temperature
decreased with time but the rate of temperature fall was lower in
the case of PCM (see Figure 10b,f, for comparison). For quantitative analyses, a region
of interest (ROI) was selected and the average temperature, as a function
of time, was determined by spatial averaging over several pixel locations
within the ROI. Caution was exercised to avoid the edge pixels within
the ROI to minimize temperature fluctuations.

infrared images during cooling of water at t = 0,
500, 1000, and 1500 s, respectively. (e–h)
Typical infrared images during freezing of the PCM, without any nanoinclusions,
at t = 0, 500, 1000, and 1500 s, respectively. The
pseudo-color-coded temperature scale is also shown along with the
images.

Figure 11 shows
the variation of normalized temperature difference [(T – T0)/T0, where T0 is the initial temperature]
as a function of normalized time (t/tm, where tm is the maximum
observation time = 2000 s) for water, PCM without any nanoinclusions,
and PCM loaded with 0.0025 and 0.0075 wt % GNPs. Figure 11 shows that water temperature
decreased exponentially with time and attained the surrounding temperature
very rapidly, whereas the PCM (with and without nanoinclusions) underwent
phase transition near the freezing point and hence the surrounding
temperature was attained at a much longer time, as compared to that
for water, which is beneficial for practical applications in thermal
energy storage and management. The presence of humps (the regions
of the temperature–time curves with negligible slope) in the
normalized temperature decay curves indicated the phase transition
regions for the PCM (with or without nanoinclusions). The slight variations
in the freezing temperatures of the PCM, with or without nanoinclusions,
were attributed to the convection losses from the top surface, which
was kept exposed to the surrounding to ensure obstructed field of
view for thermal mapping.

Figure 11 Variation of the normalized temperature difference
[(T – T0)/T0, where T0 is the
initial temperature]
as a function of normalized time (t/tm, where tm is the maximum
observation time = 2000 s) for water, PCM without any nanoinclusions,
and PCM loaded with 0.0025 and 0.0075 wt % GNP nanoinclusions. The
presence of phase transition regions for the PCM (with or without
nanoinclusions) is also indicated in the figure.

It can be further seen from Figure 11 that the freezing process was the fastest
for the PCM loaded with 0.0075 wt % GNPs, followed by the PCM loaded
with 0.0025 wt % GNPs and the PCM without any nanoinclusions, in the
decreasing order. This was attributed to the higher thermal conductivity
of the PCM loaded with GNPs. The freezing time was estimated as ∼1014
(±1), 921 (±1), and 846 (±1) s for the PCM without
any nanoinclusions and PCM loaded with 0.0025 and 0.0075 wt % GNPs,
respectively. For the PCM loaded with 0.0075 wt % GNPs, the gain in
freezing time was ∼16.5%, which indicated a proportionate increase
in the charging/discharging rate, which is immensely beneficial for
practical applications of the nanoinclusion-loaded PCM for thermal
energy storage.4 Faster freezing time was
also reported by Harikrishnan et al.60 for
stearic acid-TiO2-based PCM, where the gain in freezing
time was ∼7.03% for 0.05 wt % TiO2 loading. Sarı
and Karaipekli61 reported ∼21.4%
gain in freezing time for palmitic acid/expanded graphite-based PCM
with loading concentration of 20 wt %. On the other hand, in the present
study, a moderately high gain (∼16.5%) in freezing time was
achieved for an extremely low concentration of nanoinclusion loading
(0.0075 wt %), which is beneficial from cost factor point of view
for practical applications.

Our results clearly show the efficacy
of IRT-based studies to remotely
map the surface temperature distribution of PCM during liquid–solid
phase transition, where freezing time can be obtained in a noncontact
way. Additional advantages of IRT-based temperature measurements include
simultaneous measurement over a wide area, noncontact and noninvasive
temperature mapping, real-time temperature acquisition, and pseudo-color-coded
images for easy representation and data analyses.

Conclusions
We studied the thermal conductivity enhancement across the liquid–solid
phase transition of hexadecane-based PCM, loaded with six different
nanoinclusions, viz., CBNP, NiNP, CuNP, AgNW, MWCNT, and GNP. The
phase transition temperature was determined from differential scanning
calorimetry studies, and the refractive index of the PCM, in the liquid
state, was found to increase with decreasing sample temperature due
to an increase in density. After liquid–solid phase transition,
the refractive index was found to decrease due to solidification-induced
cracking of the pellets. The loading of nanoinclusions caused an enhancement
in thermal conductivity of the PCM, which was more prominent in the
solid state. The higher thermal conductivity in the solid state was
attributed to the formation of a nanocrystalline phase on solidification,
consisting of a needlelike microstructure, which was confirmed from
optical phase contrast microscopy. In the solid state, the nanoinclusions
were squeezed toward the intercrystallite grain boundaries, forming
a quasi-2D network of percolating structures with high thermal transport
efficiency due to the enhancement of phonon-mediated heat transfer
and near-field radiative heat transfer along the thermal trajectories.
For the PCM loaded with CBNP, CuNP, MWCNT, and GNP nanoinclusions,
thermal conductivity enhancements increased with the concentration
of the nanoinclusions due to the formation of larger-sized aggregates
with improved conduction path. On the other hand, for the PCM loaded
with NiNPs and AgNWs, thermal conductivity decreased at higher concentrations
of the nanoinclusions due to the formation of larger aggregates, which
were prone to sedimentation. Among the carbon-based nanoinclusions,
the highest enhancement in thermal conductivity was obtained for the
PCM loaded with CBNP nanoinclusions, which was attributed to the low
fractal dimensions and volume-filling capacity of CBNP aggregates
with efficient phonon coupling. In the case of metallic nanoinclusions,
the highest thermal conductivity enhancement was obtained for the
PCM loaded with AgNW nanoinclusions, which was attributed to the large
aspect ratio of AgNWs. Our findings indicated that surface functionalization
of the GNP nanoinclusions with oleic acid resulted in better thermal
stability of the nanoinclusion-loaded PCM, without significant reduction
in thermal conductivity, which is beneficial for practical applications.
The carboxylic group of oleic acid was bound to the nanoinclusions,
whereas the long aliphatic chain was extended into the nonpolar matrix
of hexadecane (PCM), thereby providing additional steric stability
that prevented the formation of large and unstable aggregates at a
higher loading concentration or after repeated thermal cycling, which
was also confirmed from optical phase contrast microscopy images.
The increased interfacial thermal resistance for the surface-functionalized
nanoinclusions was also studied theoretically, and the theoretical
and experimental results were found to be in good agreement. Infrared-thermography-based
experiments were carried out to monitor the sample temperature during
phase transition in a noncontact way, and freezing time gain for the
nanoinclusion-loaded PCM was quantified remotely using infrared thermography.
Our study clearly shows the significant role of aggregation and volume-filling
networks in thermal conductivity enhancement and thermal stability
of nanoinclusion-loaded hexadecane. The findings from the present
study will be beneficial for tailoring the properties of nanoinclusion-loaded
hexadecane-based PCM for thermal energy storage and reversible thermal
switching applications at room temperature.

Materials and Methods
Materials
In the present study, hexadecane (C16H34)
was used as a phase change material (PCM). Hexadecane
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (99% purity). Six different nanoinclusions
were used in the present study, viz., carbon black nanopowder (CBNP),
nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs), copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), silver
nanowires (AgNWs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and graphene
nanoplatelets (GNPs). CBNP, AgNWs, and GNPs were obtained from Reinste,
whereas NiNPs, CuNPs, and MWCNT were purchased from NanoAmor. The
materials received from the suppliers were used without any further
purifications.

Experimental Methods
Characterization of Nanoinclusions
Room temperature
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), small-angle X-ray scattering, and
dynamic light scattering studies were carried out to measure the size
distributions and stability of the nanoinclusions. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out to ascertain possible
interactions between the PCM and nanoinclusions. The solidification
and melting temperatures and latent heat of fusion of the PCM were
determined from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies using
Q200 (TA Instruments) in the temperature range of 0.1–80 °C
with heating and cooling rates of 3 °C min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Variations of refractive index of the
PCM as a function of temperature were measured using an automatic
refractometer (J357 series, Rudolph Research Analytical). Section S5, in the Supporting Information, describes
the characterization techniques in detail.

Preparation of Nanoinclusion-Loaded
PCM
Before adding
to the PCM (hexadecane), CBNP, NiNPs, AgNWs, and GNPs were surface-functionalized
with oleic acid. An appropriate quantity of CBNP, NiNP, AgNW, and
GNP was added in 2 mL of oleic acid, and the samples were sonicated
for 20 min, followed by magnetic stirring for 40 min at a temperature
of ∼70 °C for completion of the coating process. Thereafter,
the samples were washed multiple times with acetone and centrifuged
at 4000 rpm to remove the excess oleic acid. The surface-functionalized
nanoinclusions were dispersed in the PCM using a horn sonicator (Sonics
Vibra-Cell), operating at 30% power for 5 min.

CuNP and MWCNT
nanoinclusions of various concentrations were directly dispersed in
the PCM using the horn sonicator, operating at 30% power for 25 min.
To compare the effect of surface functionalization on thermal conductivity
enhancement and thermal stability after consecutive thermal cycling,
experiments were also performed on the PCM loaded with uncoated (GNPs-UC)
and coated graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). GNPs-UC were directly dispersed
in the PCM using the horn sonication technique. Five different concentrations
of the nanoinclusions were used, viz., 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075,
and 0.01 wt %.

Microscopic images of the PCM loaded with different
nanoinclusions,
in the liquid state, were acquired using an inverted phase contrast
microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 10× objective.

Measurement
of Thermal Conductivity Using a Transient Hot-Wire
Probe
A transient hot-wire probe (KD2) was used for thermal
conductivity measurement of the PCM (with or without nanoinclusions).
In the transient hot-wire technique, thermal conductivity is quantified
on the basis of heat dissipation from a linear heat source, where
the temperature rise is expressed by the following equation8 8  Here T, T0, q, k, t, γ, dr, and α indicate time-dependent
temperature, initial temperature, heat flux per unit length, thermal
conductivity of the medium, time, Euler’s constant (=0.5772),
radial distance from the probe, and thermal diffusivity of the medium,
respectively. For distances close to the hot-wire probe, i.e., small
values of dr, the thermal conductivity
of the medium is quantified from the slope of the variation of temperature
rise (ΔT = T – T0) curve, as a function of natural logarithm
of time, which can be expressed by the following equation4 9  Here ΔT1 and ΔT2 indicate
the temperature
rise at times t1 and t2, respectively. Thermal conductivity measurements on
the PCM at different temperatures were carried out by placing the
sample holder along with the hot-wire probe in a recirculating water
bath with precise temperature control (±0.1 °C). The sample
assembly was thermally insulated using a custom-made arrangement,
and thermal conductivity measurements were carried out in the steady
state, after a time delay of ∼600 s, for ensuring temperature
homogeneity. To ensure a proper contact between the hot-wire probe
and the sample, the sample–probe assembly was also isolated
from mechanical vibrations. Before proceeding with quantitative measurements,
the KD2 probe was calibrated for three standard liquids, viz., water,
kerosene, and ethylene glycol and the data was also validated using
hot disk thermal constant analyzer (model: TPS-2500s, Sweden).8Section S6, in the
Supporting Information, describes the standardization procedure in
detail. All thermal conductivity measurements were repeated three
times, and data is represented as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). Standard deviations around the mean values were
considered as the standard uncertainties in thermal conductivity values.
The standard uncertainty in the thermal conductivity ratio (k/kf) was calculated from the
law of error propagation, i.e., u(k/kf) = (k/kf) × [(u(k)/k)2 + (u(kf)/kf)2]0.5. To probe the thermal stability of the nanoinclusion-loaded PCM,
thermal cycling studies, for at least four cycles, were performed
by successive solidification and melting of the PCM (with or without
nanoinclusions).

Noncontact Temperature Measurement Using
Infrared Thermography
Infrared thermography (IRT) is a noncontact
temperature measurement
methodology, where the infrared rays emitted from the surface of the
object under investigation are detected using a suitable infrared
detector and the object temperature is measured from the intensity
of the infrared radiation using the following radiometric equation62 10  Here Mcam is the
radiance received by the infrared detector, which is housed inside
a suitable infrared camera along with the appropriate electronics,
optics, and cooling mechanisms. Mobj, Menv, and Matm are
the radiance emitted by the object under investigation, surrounding
environment, and atmosphere, respectively. τ and ε indicate
atmospheric transmittance and surface emissivity, respectively. For
laboratory experiments, τ ∼ 1, and for real objects,
ε < 1 (for a hypothetical perfect blackbody, ε = 1).
Under these assumptions, eq 10 can be simplified
as Mcam = εMobj + (1 – ε)Menv.
The radiance received by the infrared detector is converted into an
electrical signal, and object temperature is obtained from suitable
calibration curves. Detailed description and numerous applications
of various IRT-based experimental techniques can be found elsewhere.62,63Section S7, in the Supporting Information,
describes the essential features of the infrared camera used in the
present study.

For IRT-based experiments, the liquid samples
(the initial temperature is higher than the phase transition temperature)
were placed in a recirculating water bath, whose temperature was kept
constant at 8.0 (±0.1) °C and the decay in sample temperature
was monitored using the infrared camera, which was placed vertically
above the sample surface to minimize the viewing angle errors. The
camera-to-sample distance was maintained at 0.35 m. At a distance
of 0.35 m, the horizontal and vertical spatial resolution was found
to be ∼0.4 mm per pixel. In the present study, for recording
infrared images, the reflected background temperature and atmospheric
transmittance were considered as 28.45 °C and 1, respectively.
The surface emissivity values were kept constant at 0.98 and 0.95
for water and hexadecane, respectively. The acquired infrared images
were later analyzed using Altair software. Figure S8, in the Supporting Information, shows a typical schematic
of the experimental setup, where the infrared camera, transient hot-wire
probe (KD2 probe), sample, and recirculating water bath are clearly
indicated.
