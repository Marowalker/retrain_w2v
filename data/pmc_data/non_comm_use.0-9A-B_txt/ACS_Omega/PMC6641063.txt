Three novel derivatives of (E)-N′-nitrobenzylidene-benzenesulfonohydrazide
(NBBSH) were synthesized
by a condensation method from nitrobenzaldehyde and benzenesulfonylhydrazine
reactants in low to moderate yields, which crystallized in methanol,
acetone, ethyl acetate, and ethanol. NBBSH derivatives were totally
characterized using various spectroscopic techniques, such as Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy,
proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR),
and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy.
The molecular structure of the NBBSH derivates was confirmed by the
single crystal X-ray diffraction method and used for potential detection
of a selective heavy metal ion, mercury (Hg2+), by a reliable I–V method. A thin coating of NBBSH
derivatives was deposited on a glassy carbon electrode (surface area
= 0.0316 cm2) with a binder (nafion) coating to modify
a sensitive and selective Hg2+ sensor with a short response
time in phosphate buffer. The modified cationic sensor exhibited enhanced
chemical performances, such as higher sensitivity, linear dynamic
range, limit of detection (LOD), reproducibility, and long-term stability
toward Hg2+. The calibration curve was found to be linear
over a wide range of Hg2+ concentrations (100.0 pM–100.0
mM). The sensitivity and LOD were considered to be ∼949.0 pA
μM–1cm–2 and 10.0 ±
1.0 pM (S/N = 3), respectively. The sensor was applied to the selective
measurement of Hg2+ in spiked water samples to give acceptable
and satisfactory results.

Introduction
Various
organic compounds consist of electron-donating functional groups via
interaction of various metal constituents and have a large number
of potential applications in catalysis, biological, environmental,
organometallic, and medicinal fields.1−4 Sulfonamides are acknowledged as sulfa drugs,
which are used as antibiotics in bacterial-type infections in animals
including humans. Sulfa drugs are also used in the treatment of bacillary
dysentery, conjunctivitis, eye and gut infections, malaria, meningitis,
and urinary tract infections.5 Using the
single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) method, supramolecular chemistry
of metal complexes of the hydrazone structure has already been explained.
Tridentate ligands were synthesized and reported with a hydrazone
backbone to co-ordinate with copper and iron as heavy metal ions.6 Mercury is one of the most dangerous heavy metals,
which is discharged from anthropogenic sources, such as coal-fired
power plants, chloralkali industry, manufacturing of electrical apparatuses
(tube lights and compact fluorescent lamps), medical incinerators,
municipal solid waste combustors, and solid waste incineration plants.
The presence of mercury damages the environment, ecosystem, and human
health (pulmonary diseases, encephalopathy, and glomerular nephritis).7−9 Mercury occurs naturally in trace amounts in natural gas and mines
as elemental mercury (Hg0), inorganic mercury (Hg–I),
organic mercury (Hg–O), and organic forms (Me–Hg), which
are more toxic than the inorganic ones (HgCl2).10,11The
key routes for human exposure to mercury contamination are consumption
of fish, fish products, drinking water (as Hg2+), inhalation
of mercury vapor (Hg0), marine mammals (as CH3Hg+), pharmaceutical products (vaccines and cleaning solution
for contact lens as CH3CH2Hg+), and
usage of personal care products.12 The
bioavailability, metabolism, and toxicity of mercury are directly
contingent on its chemical forms and their functional groups. Alkyl
mercury has been considered more poisonous than inorganic mercury
due to its bioaccumulation, chemical stability, hypertoxicity to human
health, long-term migration, and biomagnifications in food stuff sequences.13,14 So, sensitive and selective determination of mercury in practical
environmental real samples (RS) is a huge concern at this point of
time. In the last 2 decades, several approaches were already introduced
for the determination of aqueous Hg2+, such as colorimetric
methods, electrochemical sensors, gas chromatography (GC), high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), ion chromatography (IC), LC, optical
fibers and optical test strips, polymers, localized surface plasmon
resonance, cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry, cold vapor fluorescence
spectrometry, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
method.15−18

Sensors based on alkyloxymercuration, DNA, oligonucleotides,
proteins,
and small organic molecules were developed by various analytical methods
for the detection of heavy toxic metal ions. Nowadays, advanced versions
of established techniques, such as capillary electrophoresis, fluorimetry,
GC, LC, MS, and spectrophotometry, are generally used for the detection
and quantification of toxic pollutants. But
these methods have serious limitations, as they are expensive, unstable,
time-consuming, and nonreproducible, and they require preconcentration
steps, which increase the risk of other hazardous by-products and
result in sample loss. Therefore, it is essential to develop an easy,
sensitive, and dependable sensor for the detection of poisonous heavy
metal ions for environmental safety, quality control of food, protection
of the ecosystem, and protection of human health.19,20 Electrochemical sensors of toxic compounds represent a significant
approach that can be used to accompany previously accessible procedures
owing to combined features, such as easy instrumentation, cost-effectiveness,
high selectivity, high sensitivity, and better efficiency.21,22 In this research approach, a simple heavy metal ionic sensor was
developed using NBBSH modified with a binder coating on a flat glassy
carbon electrode (GCE). This is the first report on sensitive and
selective determination of toxic and carcinogenic Hg2+ ions
using 3-NBBSH via a dependable I–V performance with a small response time (r.t.).

condensation method with the procured reactants, such as 2-nitrobenzaldehyde,
3-nitrobenzaldehyde, and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (1) and
benzenesulfonylhydrazine (2) (Scheme 1).23 The synthesized
compounds (3–5) were characterized
using different spectroscopic instruments. The structures were established
by SCXRD studies. Detailed spectroscopic analyses of the synthesized
molecules (3–5) are discussed in
the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S9).

Crystallographic Characterization
of NBBSH Molecules
To
know the three-dimensional behavior of the synthesized molecules (3–5), they are crystallized and diffracted
using a single-crystal diffractometer. The unit cell is monoclinic
with P21/n, P21/n, and P21/c space
groups for 3–5, respectively (Table 1). The geometry around
the S atoms in molecules 3–524−27 is very close to that of other related molecules already reported
with <O1/S1/O2
= 120.37(9), 119.33(9), and 119.83(9)°. The dihedral angle between
the two aromatic rings (C1–C6) and (C8–C13) are 83.22(7),
88.91(8), and 84.92(7)°, respectively in compounds 3–5. The nitro groups N1/O1/O2 and N3/O3/O4 are
twisted at dihedral angles of 24.35(3), 8.12(2), and 6.98(5)°
with respect to the aromatic rings (C1–C6 and C8–C13). The
planes formed by the sulfonyl groups S1/O3/O4 and S1/O1/O2 are twisted
at dihedral angles of 57.07(1), 84.65(1), and 48.51(2)° to the
plane formed by the attached aromatic ring (C8–C13 and C1–C6)
in molecules 3–5, respectively (Figure 1 and Tables S1–S4).

In compound 3, both of the planes
are almost perpendicular
to each other. The intermolecular interaction between the molecules
through the classical and nonclassical hydrogen bonding is explained
in Figure 2. A classical
N–H···O linkage connects the molecules to form
dimers R22(16), and these dimers
are further connected to form another 18-membered ring motif R22(18). Both linkages are formed
with infinite chains along the c axes, which are
connected through C–H···O weak hydrogen bonding
and generate a two-dimensional network along the bc plane. The compounds are further stabilized by the intermolecular
classical and nonclassical hydrogen bonding interactions. N–H···O
and C–H···N interactions with the symmetry code
3/2 – x, 1/2 + y, 3/2 –
z connect the molecules to form nine-membered ring motifs R22(9)28 and form a polymeric infinite long chain along the b axes in molecule 4. The sulfonamide group is involved
in very strong hydrogen bonding through N–H of hydrazone and
O of the sulfonyl group with the symmetry code −x, 1/2 + y, 3/2 – z. Another
nonclassical hydrogen bonding of C–H···O along
with the N–H···O interaction produces 12-membered
ring motifs R33(12), as presented
in compound 5 (Table 2). Bond angle information is provided for 2-NBBSH (3), 3-NBBSH (4), and 4-NBBSH (5)
in Tables S2 and S4.

Application
Detection of Hg2+ by (E)-N′-(3-Nitrobenzylidene)-Benzenesulfonohydrazide
(3-NBBSH)
Development of the fabricated electrode with organic
compounds
is the preliminary stage of utilization as a metal ionic sensor under
room conditions. The considerable use of NBBSH assembled as a heavy
metal ionic sensor onto the GCE was evaluated for the recognition
and measurement of target mercury ion, Hg2+ in the PB phase.
The NBBSH/GCE sensor has various advantages such as it is chemically
inert, easy to fabricate, nontoxic, and stable in air. On the basis
of the I–V principle, the
current responses of 3-NBBSH/GCE are considerably altered during the
adsorption of Hg2+ onto sensor surfaces by electrochemical
reduction. The overall process of electrode fabrication, possible
means of Hg2+ reduction, and consequential I–V responses are explained and presented
in a schematic diagram, Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation of Sensor Fabrication and
Detection Mechanism
of Hg2+ Ion with a 3-NBBSH/GCE Sensor
The prospective application of NBBSH assembled
onto GCE as Hg2+ cationic sensor was studied and investigated
for measuring
and detecting the target heavy metal ion in a buffer system. NBBSH
assembled onto an electrode can be used as a metal ion sensor for
the detection of selective heavy metallic target cations that are
hazardous, unfriendly, and carcinogenic in biological and environmental
systems. First, the derivatives of NBBSH were optimized in the PB
system (pH = 7.0) under room conditions. Among all derivatives, 3-NBBSH
exhibits the highest I–V response
compared with others (Figure 3a). Metal ions such as Au3+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Ce2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sb3+, Y3+, and Zn2+ were used (100.0 nM; 25 μL) to
find the maximum current responses toward the 3-NBBSH-fabricated electrode.
After the experiment, it was clearly observed that the sensor was
more selective toward Hg2+ compared with other metallic
ions (Figure 3b). The
outstanding selectivity is ascribed to functional groups that exhibit
strong and constant interaction with Hg2+, consequently
resulting in an increased current response in the electrochemical
approach. The selectivity was assessed with different derivatives
of the NBBSH compound (analyte concentration used was 1.0 nM). Among
them, 3-NBBSH is found to have the highest I–V response toward Hg2+ (Figure 3c); selectivity optimization is presented
using a bar diagram at +1.2 V (Figure 3d).

Figure 3 (a) I–V responses

compounds (2-NBBSH, 3-NBBSH, and 4-NBBSH) coated on a GCE (at pH =
7.0); (b) selectivity study at 100.0 nM in the presence of various
cations including mercury; (c) control experiment with various synthesized
compounds under identical conditions, [analyte concentration = 100.0
nM, pH = 7.0, amount: 25.0 μL, surface area of GCE = 0.0316
cm2, method: I–V, delay time = 1.0 s]; and (d) bar diagram presentation of selectivity
optimization at +1.2 V.

The current signals of the bare GCE, nafion-coated GCE, and
3-NBBSH-coated
GCE were investigated, and the results are presented in Figure 4a. The differences in the current
responses among the bare, nafion-coated and 3-NBBSH-coated GCEs are
investigated. The current signal is increased in the case of the coated
electrode compared to that of the bare GCE and nafion-coated GCE.
The current signals without Hg2+ (black-dotted), and of
nafion-Hg2+ (red-dotted) and 3-NBBSH-Hg2+ (blue
dotted) were also studied at 1.0 nM concentration and are presented
in Figure 4b. An increase
in current response was observed for the modified 3-NBBSH electrode
with Hg2+ compared with that of other derivatives, due
to the large surface area with better coverage in absorption and adsorption
ability onto the 3-NBBSH surfaces toward the target metal ion, Hg2+. The nafion coating slightly blocks the surface of the GCE
electrode. Therefore, current is slightly decreased with nafion binders
in the presence of the analyte. But in the case of fabricated 3-NBBSH,
the current is significantly increased due to the Hg2+ interaction
with the functional groups of the compound. I–V responses of Hg2+ at different concentrations to the 3-NBBSH-modified electrode were
examined with the indication of changes in current for the fabricated
electrode as a function of Hg2+ concentration under room
conditions. It is reported that the current responses increase gradually
from lower to higher concentration of the target selective metal ion,
Hg2+ [SD = 5.23, RSD = 19.55%, and n =
10 (Figure 4c)]. A
large range of Hg2+ concentrations was employed from a
lower to a higher potential (0.0 ∼ +1.5 V) to find the possible
analytical detection limit. The linear calibration curve at +0.7 V
was plotted in the Hg2+ concentration range of 100.0 pM
∼ 100.0 mM. The regression coefficient (R2 = 0.9980), sensitivity (949.0 pA μM–1 cm–2), and the limit of detection (LOD) (10.0
± 1.0 pM) at S/N ∼3 were calculated from the calibration
curve (Figure 4d).
The linear dynamic range (LDR) (100.0 pM ∼ 1.0 mM) of the fabricated
electrode was also calculated from the practical concentration deviation
diagram (Figure 5a).
The r.t. of Hg2+ toward the electrode was measured at 100.0
nM and was found to be 7.0 s (Figure 5b).

nM of Hg2+ [RA calculated at the calibration potential,
+0.7 V], and (d) real-sample analysis (industrial effluent, red sea
water, and tap water).

The sensing performance of the 3-NBBSH-coated electrode was
examined
up to 2 weeks for the study of the reproducibility as well as storage
stability. For sensor repeatability, it was measured by a series of
six successive readings in a similar concentration of Hg2+ (100.0 nM), which exhibited an excellent reproducible response with
the 3-NBBSH electrode in identical systems (SD = 1.05, RSD = 5.84%,
and n = 6). It was found that the I–V responses were not comprehensively changed
after washing the fabricated 3-NBBSH electrode (Figure 5c) with buffer in each experiment. The sensitivity
remained approximately the same as the original one, up to 2 weeks,
and subsequently, the responses of the modified electrode decreased
slowly. The responses of the 3-NBBSH sensor were considered with respect
to storage time for the purpose of long-term storage stability. The
storage ability of the 3-NBBSH electrode sensor was examined at the
calibration potential (+0.7 V) under standard conditions. The repeatability
(RA) toward Hg2+ was also found to be 83% of the preliminary
response for several days (Figure 5c and Table S5). It was
evidently reported that the fabricated sensor may be used without
any significant loss of sensitivity up to a few weeks.

The analytical
performances, for example, the sensitivity and LOD,
of the fabricated 3-NBBSH/GCE are attributed to the outstanding absorption
and adsorption aptitude, including elevated catalytic activity or
interaction with functional groups and superior biocompatibility of
3-NBBSH. The expected sensitivity of the modified 3-NBBSH/GCE sensor
is relatively higher and the LOD is comparatively lower with respect
to earlier reported heavy metal ionic sensors based on different modified
electrodes.29−35The
3-NBBSH/binder/GCE has provided a significantly favorable nanoenvironment
for Hg2+ recognition with excellent sensitivity. The
higher sensitivity of the NBBSH/GCE is provided by the higher electron
communication and good interaction features with functional groups,
which significantly increase the electron transfer between the active
functional sites of 3-NBBSH and nafion/GCE. The NBBSH/GCE scheme is
established as an easy and dependable method for the detection of
poisonous heavy metal ions by the I–V method. A comparison of Hg2+ detection using
different modified electrodes7,36−44 is presented in Table 3.

Analysis of RS
RS, such as industrial effluent, red
sea water, and tap
water, were examined to validate the cationic sensors using the 3-NBBSH/GCE
by the I–V system. A typical
addition technique was used to determine the unknown concentration
of Hg2+ in real environmental samples. A fixed amount (∼25.0
μL) of each original sample was analyzed in PB (10.0 mL, 100.0
mM) using the fabricated 3-NBBSH/GCE under room conditions. The results
were found for the determination of Hg2+ in industrial
effluent, red sea water, and tap water, which actually confirmed that
the proposed I–V procedure
is acceptable, dependable, and appropriate for analyzing RS (Figure 5d and Table 4).

Interference Effect
Investigation
of the interference effect is one of the significant approaches in
analytical science, due to the ability to differentiate the interfering
effects of different heavy toxic metal ions having similar cationic
nature. Ba2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+ are generally used as interfering cations
in an electrochemical Hg2+ sensor.44,45I–V responses on the 3-NBBSH/GCE
toward the addition of Hg2+ and interfering heavy metal
ions, for example, Ba2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+ (100.0 μM, and 25.0
μL) in PB (pH = 7.0) were examined. The
effects of interfering cations on Hg2+ were studied at
the calibrated potential (+0.7 V) and compared with the effect of
Hg2+ (Figure 6 and Table 5). From
the interference study, it is found that the 3-NBBSH/GCE does not
exhibit any significant current response toward the other interfering
heavy metal ions. Hence, the fabricated sensor is suitable for the
detection of Hg2+ with excellent sensitivity. The interaction
effect in the presence of Hg2+ with 3-NBBSH was also studied
by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy and inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and the results
are presented in the Supporting Information section (Figures S10 and S11). In the presence of Hg2+,
λmax is shifted toward the higher wavelength due
to the interaction of Hg2+ with the functional groups existing
in the synthesized 3-NBBSH. The prepared 3-NBBSH sample was studied
after digesting with standard chemicals [HNO3 (4.0 mL)
+ HCl (4.0 mL) + HClO4 (1.0 mL)] for the detection of Hg2+ by the ICP-OES conventional method and reasonable results
were obtained (SD = 0.38, RSD = 0.57%, n = 3, and R2 = 0.9986), which are presented in the ESM
section (Figure S11 and Table S6).

Conclusions
Different derivatives of NBBSH compounds
were synthesized, characterized,
and applied to identify toxic heavy metallic ions using the I–V method. Methodical performances
of the Hg2+ sensor using the NBBSH/GCE were evaluated by
a reliable I–V technique
with analytical parameters of LOD, sensitivity with short r.t., and
reproducible aptitude. This approach has demonstrated higher selectivity
and rapid detection of Hg2+ ion using the 3-NBBSH/nafion/GCE
probe. Practically, a similar conception may be applied for the development
of various heavy toxic metallic cationic sensors for monitoring other
carcinogenic and hazardous cations in practical environmental monitoring.
This new sensor can be introduced as an innovative system for the
development of efficient cationic sensors for monitoring toxic metal
ions in biological, environmental, and health care fields.

Experimental
Section
Material and Methods
Chemicals of analytical grade,
such as 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, 3-nitrobenzaldehyde, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde,
benzenesulfonylhydrazine, AuCl3, Ba(NO3)2, CdSO4, Ce(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2, Cr(NO3)3, HgCl2, NiCl2, Pb(NO3)2, SbCl3, Y(NO3)3, ZnSO4, EtOH, MeOH, NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, and nafion
(5% ethanolic solution), were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich company
and were used as received. A mother solution of heavy metal ion, Hg2+ (100.0 mM), was prepared from HgCl2. A Stuart
scientific SMP3 (version 5.0) melting point apparatus (Bibby Scientific
Limited, Staffordshire, U.K.) was used to record the melting point,
and the reported melting point uncorrected. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on an AVANCE-III instrument (400
and 850 MHz, Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland) at 300 K, and chemical
shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) with reference to
the signal of residual solvent. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra were recorded neat on a Thermo scientific NICOLET iS50 FTIR
spectrometer (Madison, WI). UV–vis study was carried out using
an Evolution 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo scientific).
The I–V method was conducted
to detect the heavy metal ion, Hg2+, at a selected point
using the fabricated 3-NBBSH/GCE on a Keithley electrometer (6517A).
Caution! Mercury is toxic. Only a small amount of this material can
be used for the preparation of the required solution with care.

Crystallography Study of NBBSH Derivatives
The three
new sulfonohydrazides (3–5) were
synthesized and crystallized from MeOH, acetone and EtOAc (50:50),
and EtOH, respectively, at room temperature by a slow evaporation
technique. Very beautiful, grainlike crystals were obtained in vials.
The samples were screened under a microscope for selecting good crystals
to mount on the instrument for data collection. The assembly used
to mount samples consists of a glass fiber inserted into wax fixed
onto a hollow copper tube supported by a magnetic base. Particular
samples were glued over a glass needle and were mounted on an Agilent
super nova (dual source) technologies diffractometer, equipped with
microfocus Cu/Mo Kα radiation for data collection. The data
collection was accomplished using the CrysAlisPro software at 296
K under Cu Kα radiation.46 The structures
were determined and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using the SHELXL-97 method with in-built WinGX.
Nonhydrogen atoms were also refined anisotropically by full-matrix
least-squares methods.47Figures 3–5 were generated through PLATON and ORTEP with in-built WinGX.48−50 All Caromatic–H hydrogen atoms were positioned
geometrically and treated as riding atoms with C–H = 0.93 Å
and Uiso (H) = 1.2 Ueq (O), and 1.2 Ueq (C). The N–H hydrogen
atoms were located through a Fourier map and refined with N–H
= 0.81(7), 0.82(3), and 0.83(2) Å, respectively, in molecules 3–5. Uiso (H) was set to 1.2 Ueq for N
atoms in all molecules. The crystal data were deposited at the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre, and the following deposition numbers
have been assigned: 1444297, 1511320, and 1511321, which are known
as the CCDC number, for molecules 3–5, respectively. Crystal data can be received free of charge on application
to CCDC 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB21 EZ, U.K. (Fax: (+44) 1223 336-033;
e-mail: data_request@ccdc.cam. ac.uk).

Fabrication
of GCE with NBBSH Compounds
NaH2PO4 (200.0 mM, 39.0 mL), Na2HPO4 (200.0 mM, 61.0
mL), and distilled water (100.0 mL) were used for
the preparation of phosphate buffer, PB (200.0 mL, 100.0 mM, pH =
7.0). EtOH was used to disperse the NBBSH molecules onto a watch glass
to make a slurry. The slurry of the dispersed compound was then deposited
on the surface of the GCE and kept in air (2 h) for drying. After
that, nafion (10.0 μL of 5% ethanolic solution was dropped onto
the dried layer of GCE) was added with the deposited electrode and
kept again in open air (1 h) for complete drying to form a uniform
film. The fabricated GCE and a platinum (Pt) wire were used as the
working and counter electrodes, respectively, to investigate the I–V signals (Scheme 2).
