Control
of single-walled carbon nanotube dispersion properties is of substantial
interest to the scientific community. In this work, we sought to investigate
the effect of a macrocycle, pillar[5]arene, on the dispersion properties
of a polymer–nanotube complex. Pillar[5]arenes are a class
of electron-rich macrocyclic hosts capable of forming inclusion complexes
with electron-poor guests, such as alkyl nitriles. A hydroxyl-functionalized
pillar[5]arene derivative was coupled to the alkyl bromide side chains
of a polyfluorene, which was then used to coat the surface of single-walled
carbon nanotubes. Noncovalent functionalization of carbon nanotubes
with the macrocycle-containing conjugated polymer significantly enhanced
nanotube solubility, resulting in dark and concentrated nanotube dispersions
(600 μg mL–1), as evidenced by UV–vis–NIR
spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Differentiation of semiconducting
and metallic single-walled carbon nanotube species was analyzed by
a combination of UV–vis–NIR, Raman, and fluorescence
spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the concentrated nanotube
dispersion produced by the macrocycle-containing polymer was due to
well-exfoliated nanotubes, rather than bundle formation. The polymer–nanotube
dispersion was investigated using 1H NMR spectroscopy,
and it was found that host–guest chemistry between pillar[5]arene
and 1,6-dicyanohexane occurred in the presence of the polymer–nanotube
complex. Utilizing the host–guest capability of pillar[5]arene,
the polymer–nanotube complex was incorporated into a supramolecular
organogel.

Introduction
Since their discovery
in 1991,1 single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) have attracted significant interest within the scientific
community because of their extraordinary structural,2−4 mechanical,5−7 and optoelectronic properties.8−10 However, intertube
π–π interactions result in the formation of insoluble
SWNT bundles,11 making nanotube processing
challenging. In addition, all commercial SWNT production processes
result in a complex mixture of semiconducting and metallic SWNTs,
which are contaminated with amorphous carbon and metal catalyst particles.12−16 To improve processability and purity, selective covalent and noncovalent
functionalization methods have been investigated.17−19 Covalent modification
utilizes reactive intermediates that form bonds with the sp2-hybridized carbon framework of the SWNT sidewall, resulting in sp3-carbon defects that deteriorate their intrinsic properties.17 Conversely, noncovalent functionalization utilizes
a dispersant that adsorbs onto the SWNT surface, forming a supramolecular
complex that does not disrupt the extended π-system.20,21 A variety of dispersants can be employed, including surfactants,22−24 aromatic small molecules,25−27 conjugated polymers,28,29 and biomacromolecules.30−36 Of these, conjugated polymers have attracted significant attention
as it is synthetically feasible to introduce a broad range of structural
variation, which has allowed demonstration of their ability to selectively
disperse specific SWNT subtypes.36 To date,
most structural modifications have aimed to achieve enriched dispersions
of semiconducting SWNTs (sc-SWNTs), with recent efforts aimed toward
developing polymer backbone structures capable of conformational changes
or depolymerization in response to a stimulus.37−41 In addition, stimulus-responsive pyrene derivatives
have been utilized for the noncovalent modification of SWNTs to control
dispersion properties. For instance, Feng and co-workers developed
an intriguing CO2-responsive42 and light-switchable dispersant–SWNT complex,43 which was shown to reversibly alter the dispersibility
of SWNTs.

Recently, we have prepared polyfluorene derivatives
possessing azide groups in their side chains, and then used these
derivatives to noncovalently functionalize SWNTs.44−46 We have demonstrated
that it is possible to decorate the resulting polymer–SWNT
complex using the strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition46 or the copper-mediated azide–alkyne cycloaddition.45 These results indicate that conjugated polymer
side chains can be tuned to impart interesting characteristics to
the polymer–SWNT complex. Here, we utilize the same design
principle to produce polymer–SWNT complexes that contain macrocycles
in the polymer side chains to influence the dispersion properties
of the resulting polymer–SWNT complex.

Macrocycles have
received intense interest in the literature,47−52 and encompass several key scaffolds that include cyclodextrins,53−55 calixarenes,56−58 cucurbiturils,59−61 and pillararenes.62−64 Owing to the seminal work by Ogoshi and co-workers,65 pillar[5]arenes have attracted significant attention because
of their facile one-step synthesis and their unique “pillar-like” structure,
composed of hydroquinone units connected by methylene bridges at the
para-positions. These pillar[5]arenes can be further derivatized to
install a single functional handle that can be used in subsequent
derivatization. The electron-rich dialkoxybenzene moieties of pillar[5]arenes
form stable inclusion complexes with various electron-poor molecules,
including viologens,66−68 alkanediamines,69,70 and alkylnitriles.71−73 Host–guest interactions with pillar[5]arenes have been used
in polymers,74−76 sensors,70,77,78 and organogels.66,79,80 In this study, we sought to explore the incorporation of pillar[5]arenes
onto the surface of a polymer–SWNT complex. We characterize
the dispersion properties before and after macrocycle incorporation
using UV–vis–NIR, Raman, and fluorescence spectroscopy,
and we determine the SWNT concentration in solution using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). We then incorporate the macrocycle-containing polymer–SWNT
dispersion into an organogel using a bis(alkylnitrile)-functionalized
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer as a cross-linking agent.

Results
and Discussion
To prepare the macrocycle-containing polymer–SWNT
complex, we first synthesized a polyfluorene derivative containing
alkyl bromides (PF-Br) according to literature procedures
(see the Supporting Information for details).81 Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis
of PF-Br revealed that the polymer had an average molecular
weight (Mn) of 31 kDa and a dispersity
(Đ) of 2.02. Separately, the ethoxy derivative
of pillar[5]arene was prepared via condensation of 1,4-diethoxybenzene
with paraformaldehyde in the presence of BF3·OEt2 (Scheme S3). The resulting structure
was then mono-de-ethylated using BBr3, resulting in the
monohydroxylated pillar[5]arene 6. This moiety was introduced
into the conjugated polymer scaffold by alkylating PF-Br with 6 via phase transfer alkylation, affording the
pillar[5]arene-containing polyfluorene, PF-Pillar (Scheme 1). As shown in Figure 1, the 1H NMR signal at 3.30 ppm in PF-Br, which corresponds
to the methylene group adjacent to the alkyl bromide, shifts to 3.76
ppm in PF-Pillar. This downfield shift of the resonance
upon alkylation is indicative of the quantitative conversion from
the alkyl bromide to the alkyl ether product.

Scheme 1 Postpolymerization Functionalization of PF-Br with 6 to Afford PF-Pillar
With our polymers in hand, polymer–SWNT dispersions
were prepared with raw HiPCO SWNTs following modified literature procedures.82 Briefly, HiPCO SWNTs (5 mg) were added to a
solution of polymer (10 mg of PF-Br or PF-Pillar) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (10 mL). The mixture was then sonicated
for 2 h in a bath sonicator chilled with ice. The resultant black
suspension was centrifuged at 8346g for 30 min, and
the supernatant was carefully isolated to obtain the polymer–SWNT
dispersion, which was stable on the benchtop for at least several
months.

To characterize the polymer–SWNT dispersion,
we first performed UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy. The absorption
features within the spectral range can be grouped into three categories:
two semiconducting regions, S11 (830–1600 nm) and
S22 (600–800 nm), and a metallic region, M11 (440–645 nm).83 As shown in Figure 2, the as-produced PF-Br–SWNT dispersion possesses sharp absorption features
that reach a maximum intensity of ∼0.9. The absence of a broad
exponential background suggests at least some degree of sc-SWNT species
enrichment. In contrast, the as-produced PF-Pillar–SWNT
dispersion was highly concentrated and exhibited absorptions in the
metallic as well as the semiconducting regions (Figure 2). The as-produced PF-Pillar–SWNT dispersion was actually too concentrated for measurement,
and required a 5-fold dilution to obtain the absorption spectrum shown
in Figure 2. We hypothesize
that steric bulk imparted by the pillar[5]arene side chains allows
for effective steric stabilization of the colloidal polymer–SWNT
dispersion.

Figure 2 UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra of polymer–SWNT
dispersions (2:1 polymer/SWNT mass ratio) in THF for PF-Pillar–SWNT (orange) and PF-Br–SWNT (blue).
The absorption spectrum of PF-Pillar–SWNT was
diluted 5-fold in THF.

To further probe the polymer–SWNT dispersions, we
employed TGA to calculate SWNT concentration. Samples for TGA were
prepared by filtering a known aliquot of polymer–SWNT dispersion
(0.5–6 mL) through a Teflon membrane with 0.2 μm pore
diameter and then washing with THF until the filtrate did not fluoresce
at 365 nm. The samples were then transferred to the TGA crucible to
determine the recovered mass of polymer–SWNT complex. As shown
in Figure S1, samples were heated to 500
°C under an argon atmosphere at a rate of 15 °C min–1. Polymer-only samples were also recorded under identical
experimental conditions, and the mass losses, which correspond to
polymer side chain degradation, could be used to calculate the SWNT
mass fraction (fSWNT) (see the Supporting Information for calculations). Given
a known volume of polymer–SWNT dispersion (Vpolymer–SWNT) containing a known mass of polymer–SWNT
complex (mpolymer–SWNT), the SWNT
concentration (cSWNT) could be calculated
as 1  The relevant data are tabulated in Table S1, and cSWNT for the PF-Br–SWNT and PF-Pillar–SWNT dispersions were
determined to be 20 and 600 μg mL–1, respectively.
These results demonstrate that the introduction of macrocyclic structures
onto the polymer side chains is effective at producing unusually concentrated
SWNT dispersions using small amounts of the polymer (∼30-fold
increase in SWNT concentration using a 2:1 polymer/SWNT mass ratio).
In comparison, a number of reports describe polymer/SWNT mass ratios
in excess of 50:1, only to produce relatively dilute dispersions.84,85

We next performed Raman spectroscopy to investigate the differences
in the SWNT populations dispersed by PF-Br and PF-Pillar. The samples were prepared by drop-casting the dispersions
onto a silicon wafer and evaporating the solvent at room temperature.
A reference sample containing raw HiPCO SWNTs was prepared by sonicating
the raw SWNTs in CHCl3 and then drop-casting the suspension
onto a silicon wafer. Raman scans were obtained using excitation wavelengths
at 514, 633, and 785 nm, as it has been shown that these excitation
wavelengths are sufficient for the characterization of the electronic
properties of HiPCO SWNTs.86Figure 3 shows the radial breathing
mode (RBM) of the Raman spectra at the three excitation wavelengths
(full Raman spectra are provided in Figure S2). The spectra were normalized to the G band at ∼1590 cm–1 and offset for clarity. In the RBM region at 514
nm, predominantly m-SWNT features (225–290 cm–1) are observed.87 The PF-Pillar–SWNT sample exhibits peaks in this region, while the PF-Br–SWNT sample does not (Figure 3a). This suggests that, under identical dispersion
preparation conditions, PF-Pillar disperses m-SWNTs,
while PF-Br does not. This result is further corroborated
by G-band analysis (the inset of Figure 3a). The G band consists of two peaks: a lower-frequency
G– and a higher-frequency G+. For sc-SWNTs,
both the G– and G+ have Lorentzian line
shapes, while for m-SWNTs, the G– exhibits a broader
Breit–Wigner–Fano (BWF) line shape.88 A broad G– band is observed for the PF-Pillar–SWNT sample, which is consistent with the
presence of m-SWNTs. Meanwhile, the PF-Br–SWNT
sample lacks the BWF line shape in the G band, confirming that m-SWNTs
are absent. At 633 nm, both m-SWNTs (175–230 cm–1) and sc-SWNTs (230–300 cm–1) are in resonance.88,89 As shown in Figure 3b, the PF-Pillar–SWNT sample exhibits peaks corresponding
to both sc- and m-SWNTs. However, only sc-SWNTs peaks are present
in the PF-Br–SWNT sample. Finally, at 785 nm,
sc-SWNTs are primarily in resonance.87,90 A few large
diameter metallic species, most notably the (16,7) and (12,9) species,
are also observed in the low-frequency region. Figure 3c shows that sc-SWNTs are present in both
the PF-Br–SWNT and PF-Pillar–SWNT
samples. Again, this demonstrates that PF-Br disperses
only sc-SWNTs, while PF-Pillar disperses both sc- and
m-SWNTs. We hypothesize that the additional steric bulk of the pillar[5]arene
macrocycle in the polyfluorene side chains improves the colloidal
stability of the polymer–SWNT complex, resulting in more concentrated
and less-selective polymer–SWNT dispersions. Beyond sc-SWNT
peaks at 785 nm, a prominent peak at 265 cm–1 arises
from the (10,2) sc-SWNT species when trapped in a SWNT bundle. Assuming
(10,2) is present, this “bundling peak” can be used
to identify the degree of bundling in a nanotube sample.82 It was found that the bundling peaks for both
polymer–SWNT samples were substantially suppressed compared
to that for the raw SWNT sample. Overall, the Raman data demonstrates
that the concentrated PF-Pillar–SWNT sample is
a function of unusual colloidal stability, rather than due to the
suspension of SWNT bundles.

using (a) 514 nm, (b) 633 nm, and (c) 785 nm excitation wavelengths.
The tray boxes denote the signals arising from sc-SWNTs, while the
pink boxes indicate the locations of signals from m-SWNTs. The inset
in (a) shows the G-band region, located at ∼1590 cm–1, upon excitation at 514 nm.

To further characterize the polymer–SWNT dispersions,
photoluminescence (PL) maps were obtained. The polymer–SWNT
dispersions were diluted in THF to obtain an absorption intensity
of ∼0.11 for the peak centered at ∼1279 nm (Figure S3). The excitation and emission energies
of various sc-SWNTs were obtained from experimental Kataura plots
and plotted on the PL map.91 As shown in Figure 4a, high-intensity
PL signals were observed in the PF-Br–SWNT dispersion,
with the most-intense peak corresponding to the (7,6) sc-SWNT species.
Other prominent species include (8,7), (8,6), and (7,5). For the PF-Pillar–SWNT dispersion, the (7,6) species is also
the most-intense species. Other prominent species include (9,4), (7,5),
(6,5), and (8,4). Interestingly, the relative fluorescence intensity
of the PF-Pillar–SWNT sample is roughly 2 orders
of magnitude lower compared to that of the PF-Br–SWNT
sample. This observation may be attributed to either SWNT bundles
or m-SWNT species present in the sample, as both are known fluorescence
quenchers.9 As Raman analysis indicates
the lack of significant bundling in the polymer–SWNT dispersions,
we attribute the observed fluorescence quenching to an increased amount
of m-SWNTs dispersed by PF-Pillar, which is consistent
with the aforementioned analyses.

by UV–vis–NIR and plotted on the same scale.

With our polymer–SWNT dispersions fully
characterized, we sought to explore the dispersion properties of the PF-Pillar–SWNT sample using 1H NMR spectroscopy.
We employed 1H NMR to investigate the host–guest
interactions in the presence of our polymer–SWNT sample. We
first examined the host–guest interactions between PF-Pillar and 1,6-dicyanohexane in THF-d8 (Figure S4). The resonance at 6.84 ppm, which
corresponds to the aromatic protons in pillar[5]arene, was shifted
downfield by 0.07 ppm upon the addition of 1,6-dicyanohexane. This
downfield shift is consistent with the association between 1,6-dicyanohexane
and a pillar[5]arene-functionalized conjugated polymer.92 To investigate the properties of the PF-Pillar–SWNT complex, we prepared a PF-Pillar–SWNT
dispersion in THF-d8 (0.75 mL), following
the previously outlined protocol (vide supra), and added hexamethyldisilane
(0.5 μL) as an internal standard. NMR spectra were normalized
to this internal standard (for full 1H NMR spectra, see Figure S5). Compared to that of PF-Pillar, the 1H NMR spectrum of the PF-Pillar–SWNT
dispersion in THF-d8 shows broad signals
that correspond to the fluorene backbone as well as the pillar[5]arene
moiety (Figure 5).
Upon addition of 1,6-dicyanohexane, the resonance corresponding to
the aromatic pillar[5]arene protons shifts from 6.83 to 6.91 ppm,
with slight broadening. Thus, it is apparent that the host–guest
chemistry between the pillar[5]arene moiety and 1,6-dicyanohexane
occurs in the presence of the polymer–SWNT complex.

Figure 5 1H NMR spectra (THF-d8, 298 K) of the PF-Pillar–SWNT dispersion recorded after successive
additions of 1,6-dicyanohexane (0–65 equiv).

Having confirmed the formation of inclusion complexes
in the presence of the PF-Pillar–SWNT dispersion,
we sought to incorporate the concentrated dispersion into supramolecular
organogels. To prepare these organogels, we first synthesized a homobifunctional
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer with terminal alkyl nitriles (PEG600-(CN)2) to act as a cross-linker, according to
literature procedures.92Figure 6 depicts an idealized cartoon
representation of the supramolecular gel. We envisioned a system where
the pillar[5]arene units interact with the alkyl nitrile groups in
the PEG600-(CN)2 cross-linker to form a uniform
cross-linked network. Using this concept, we prepared 40 wt % organogels
in 1,2-dichlorobenzene by adding PEG600-(CN)2 cross-linker to the PF-Pillar–SWNT dispersion
(see the Supporting Information for details).
After 30 min of incubation under ambient conditions, both the PF-Pillar–PEG600-(CN)2 (native)
and PF-Pillar–SWNT–PEG600-(CN)2 (hybrid) mixtures formed gels that did not flow when the
microcentrifuge tube was inverted, as shown in Figure 7. The resultant gels were soft and tacky
in texture, with a marked difference in color between the native (yellow)
and hybrid (black) gels. In a control experiment, PF-Pillar and PEG600 were mixed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene under conditions
identical to those used to form the aforementioned organogels (see
the Supporting Information for details).
Upon inversion, this control mixture remained liquid and flowed down
the wall of the container (Figure 7). Mechanical testing of the organogels was conducted
using a home-built apparatus that measures the contact mechanics between
a glass hemisphere and the organogel samples (see the Supporting Information for details). Briefly,
the hemispherical indenter was attached to a force transducer to measure
the force applied (F) as a function of indenter vertical
position (d). Young’s modulus was calculated
using Hertzian theory, where Young’s modulus was obtained as
the slope when plotting F versus d. We determined that Young’s moduli of PF-Pillar and PF-Pillar–SWNT gels were 6.0 ± 0.2
and 5.8 ± 1.3 kPa, respectively. We hypothesize that the wt %
of SWNT in the PF-Pillar–SWNT organogel may be
too low to observe substantial differences in mechanical properties.
Given the limitation of our dispersion concentration, we could not
further concentrate the PF-Pillar–SWNT dispersion
to improve the SWNT loading. Overall, we demonstrate that supramolecular
organogels incorporating PF-Pillar-coated SWNTs can be
produced, and that gelation is unaffected by the presence of SWNTs.

ribbon) is depicted to wrap around SWNTs in a helical fashion. However,
the polymer backbone may also irregularly coat the SWNT surface.

from the host–guest interaction between PF-Pillar and PEG600-(CN)2 (native) and in the presence

Conclusions
Here,
we demonstrate that a macrocycle-containing polyfluorene derivative
can produce unusually concentrated polymer–SWNT dispersions.
The quantitative alkylation of polyfluorene with mono-de-ethylated
pillar[5]arene was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. We
show that the facile modification of a polyfluorene backbone with
a pillar[5]arene macrocycle has a significant impact on the polymer–SWNT
dispersion properties. As evidenced by UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy,
the dispersion postfunctionalization with a macrocycle was substantially
more concentrated than the corresponding dispersion without the macrocycle.
It was found that the polyfluorene derivative improved the concentration
of SWNTs ∼30-fold, from 20 to 600 μg mL–1, as determined by TGA. Using Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy,
it was determined that the initial polyfluorene derivative preferentially
dispersed sc-SWNT species, while the pillar[5]arene-decorated polyfluorene
produced dispersions containing both sc- and m-SWNTs. The formation
of an inclusion complex between pillar[5]arene and 1,6-dicyanohexane
was confirmed in the presence of the macrocycle-containing polymer–SWNT
complex. This polymer–SWNT dispersion was then successfully
incorporated into supramolecular organogels.

Experimental Section
All reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were used
as received without further purification. Raw HiPCO SWNTs were purchased
from NanoIntegris (batch #HR27-104, 10 wt % in anhydrous EtOH) and
used without further purification. Flash chromatography was performed
using an IntelliFlash 280 system from Analogix. Unless otherwise noted,
compounds were monitored using a variable wavelength detector at 254
nm. Solvent amounts used for gradient or isocratic elution were reported
in column volumes. Columns were prepared in Biotage SNAP KP-Sil cartridges
using 40–63 μm silica or 25–40 μm silica
purchased from Silicycle. 1H NMR spectra of small molecules
and polymers were recorded on Bruker Avance 600 and 700 MHz spectrometers,
respectively. Polymer molecular weights and dispersities were analyzed
(relative to polystyrene standards) via GPC using a Waters 2695 Separations
Module equipped with a Waters 2414 refractive index detector and a
Jordi Fluorinated DVB mixed bed column in series with a Jordi Fluorinated
DVB 105 Å pore size column. THF with 2% acetonitrile
was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 2.0 mL min–1. Sonication was performed in a Branson Ultrasonic B2800 bath sonicator.
Centrifugation of the polymer–SWNT samples was performed using
a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-22 centrifuge. UV–vis–NIR
spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 spectrometer in dual beam mode,
using matching 10 mm quartz cuvettes. Thermogravimetric analysis was
performed on a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 3+, and all measurements were
conducted under an argon atmosphere, with sample masses ranging from
0.5 to 1.0 mg. Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw InVia
Laser Raman spectrometer, with three different lasers: a 25 mW argon
ion laser (514 nm, 1800 L mm–1 grating), a 500 mW
HeNe Renishaw laser (633 nm, 1800 L mm–1 grating),
and a 300 mW Renishaw laser (785 nm, 1200 L mm–1 grating). For the raw SWNT sample dispersed in CHCl3,
laser intensity was set to 1% for 514 and 633 nm, and 10% for 785
nm. For the polymer–SWNT samples, laser intensity was set to
1% for all excitation wavelengths. Fluorescence spectra were recorded
on a Jobin-Yvon SPEX Fluorolog 3.22 equipped with a 450 W Xe arc lamp,
a digital photon counting photomultiplier, and an InGaAs detector,
also using a 10 mm quartz cuvette. Slit widths for both excitation
and emission were set to 10 nm band-pass, and correction factor files
were applied to account for instrument variations. Photoluminescence
maps were obtained at 25 °C, with 5 nm intervals for both the
excitation and the emission.
