Nanoparticle drug delivery applications have predominantly focused
on the entrapment and delivery of hydrophobic molecules with poor
water solubility. However, benefits can also be obtained from nanoparticle-based
delivery of hydrophilic therapeutics. This study reports on the development
of a p(HEMA-ran-GMA)-based nanoparticle synthesized
via a spontaneous water-in-oil inverse nanoemulsion to deliver doxorubicin,
a water-soluble chemotherapeutic. High drug loading efficiency and
sustained release of doxorubicin from Cy5-functionalized p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles enabled effective inhibition of the
MCF-7 human breast cancer derived cell line. Direct comparative analyses
with a hydrophobic PGMA nanoparticle demonstrated enhanced capabilities
of the p(HEMA-ran-GMA)-based nanoparticle in vitro.
The results suggest that p(HEMA-ran-GMA)-based nanoparticles,
which are better suited for hydrophilic drug loading and delivery,
may have the potential for the improved therapeutic effect in vivo
by enhanced permeation and retention of the nanoparticles by avoidance
of off-site side effects of the chemotherapeutic.

Introduction
The advent
of nanomedicine is a promising alternative to overcome limitations
of chemotherapy-mediated cancer therapy. Drug-loaded nanocarriers
such as liposomes, polymer conjugates, polymer nanoparticles, and
micelles1 can take advantage of the enhanced
permeation and retention (EPR) effect due to the aberrant hypervascularization
at tumorigenic sites, to increase the local concentration of the nanoencapsulated
therapeutic cargo in tumors while reducing exposure of the drug to
healthy cells.2 This tactic is proposed
to increase the therapeutic index of chemotherapeutic agents such
as doxorubicin (DOX) at the tumor site.

DOX, a potent, anthracycline
antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius,3 is frequently
used as the first-line anti-tumor agent in the oncologic practice.4 Having the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for its medical use, DOX has been indicated for
administration as an intravenous bolus, either as a single agent or
in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for higher response
rates and early onset of clinical benefits5 for the treatment of a variety of cancers such as acute myeloblastic
leukemia, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, esophageal
carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and metastatic breast cancer.6 Liposomal formulations of DOX such as Doxil, Caelyx, and
Myocet are currently in clinical use with evidence of lowered occurrences
of DOX-related toxicity.7 Such nanoscaled
lipid bilayer drug delivery vehicles have been extensively studied
due to their capacity to effectively load and release both hydrophobic
(e.g., paclitaxel) and hydrophilic (e.g., DOX) drugs.8,9 However, the introduction of liposomal drugs has been associated
with palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) and mucositis, which
can significantly impair the patient’s quality of life with
no effective methods of prevention or treatment apart from dose reductions.10 Additionally, liposomal formulations have yet
to address issues pertaining to the reversal of the multiple drug
resistance (MDR) phenotype in tumor cells appropriately, which continues
to be a hurdle in effective cancer treatment.1

Of the various nanoparticulate formulations being explored
for therapeutic purposes, polymeric nanoparticles are highly attractive
because of the versatility of the material, highly controllable physicochemical
properties, relative ease, repeatability of production, and low cost.
Good biocompatibility and biodegradability of polymers such as poly(lactic
glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(caprolactone) (PCL) have also been
indicated as an added advantage for therapeutic use as immune responses
can be minimized.11 However, as hydrophilic
drug delivery using polymeric nanoparticles can be challenging, largely
due to the lack of interaction between the polymeric material and
water-soluble drugs,12 and clinical translation
of polymeric nanoparticulate systems to enhance treatment with hydrophilic
drugs such as DOX has been hindered. This has been the case even with
amphiphilic and well-established PLGA-based nanoparticles.11 The poor dispersion of hydrophilic drugs within
the polymer matrix may result in inadequate drug loading and inefficient
pharmacokinetics brought about by the “burst” effect
when the polymeric nanoparticles are introduced into the physiological
environment. The rapidly exposed drugs may also be prematurely subjected
to hydrolytic degradation, leading to unsuitable biodistribution.
Therefore, although polymer-based nanoparticles have had comparative
success in the incorporation and delivery of hydrophobic drugs for
therapy, there are still limitations in the development of formulations
designed for the encapsulation and release of water-soluble drugs,
creating a demand for the development of efficient hydrophilic nanoparticles
for drug delivery. Surface wettability of nanoparticles is also a
key factor to consider when developing therapeutic nanoparticles for
cancer therapy, as hydrophobic nanoparticles have been known to preferentially
accumulate various serum proteins on their surfaces, leading to opsonization
by reticuloendothelial system (RES) recognition,13 which could potentially reduce the possibility of passive
nanoparticle uptake at tumorigenic sites by the EPR effect.

Results and Discussion
In this study,
hydrophilic polymeric nanoparticles were prepared using a water-soluble
random copolymer, p(HEMA-ran-GMA), via a spontaneous
water-in-oil (W/O) inverse nanoemulsion method (Scheme 1). The random copolymer was synthesized by
atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
(HEMA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). Gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H
NMR) assessment of the copolymer indicated that the weighted average
molecular weight was 29.3 kDa, and the copolymer backbone was consisted
of ∼13% GMA (see Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information). p(HEMA-ran-GMA) was deemed
a suitable base material for the hydrophilic nanoparticle formulation
due to the presence of hydroxyl functional groups from HEMA, which
enables water-trapping capability, and the presence of highly reactive
epoxide groups from GMA that may facilitate a wide range of nucleophilic
ring-opening reactions for the functionalization.

via Spontaneous Water-in-Oil (W/O) Inverse Nanoemulsion
Nanoparticles
were
retrieved after formation by disruption of the emulsion through the
addition of water.

As depicted
in Scheme 1, the solubilization
of p(HEMA-ran-GMA) in water was an important factor
that supported the W/O spontaneous nanoemulsion method to produce
cross-linked, hydrophilic polymeric nanoparticles. The use of the
double-chained anionic surfactant, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT)
as the surfactant, was advantageous due to its low water solubility
and ability to stabilize the emulsion without the requirement of a
further co-surfactant as used in other W/O systems.14 This is due to the fact that AOT, when dissolved in organic
solvents, forms thermodynamically stable micelles consisting of a
hydrophilic core that is compartmentalized by the hydrophilic head
group of the AOT with the hydrophobic alkyl tails extending into the
nonpolar continuous phase solvent.15 Ethylene
diamine is a suitable cross-linking reagent to impart structural rigidity
to the core of the nanoparticles in the emulsion, which are then readily
retrieved as a suspension by centrifugation, after disrupting the
stable W/O emulsion by the addition of excess Milli-Q water. Hydrophobic
poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA)-based nanoparticles were assessed
in parallel in this study. PGMA nanoparticles were synthesized by
the solvent evaporation oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion method, and the
justifications for their use for therapeutic purposes have been previously
described extensively.16−18

Both p(HEMA-ran-GMA)- and PGMA-based nanoparticles
synthesized for this study were functionalized with a Cyanine5 (Cy5)
fluorophore to allow detection and tracking by fluorescent confocal
imaging (see Schematic S1 in the Supporting
Information). Table 1 summarizes the data obtained for the nanoparticle variants’
hydrodynamic sizes using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the respective
surface charges. Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information shows the nanoparticle variants’ size distribution
with respect to scattering light intensity. It could be observed that
the surface charge of the p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticle
became less negative as the functionalization proceeded stepwise toward
the Cy5 conjugation, indicating changes in surface modification of
the nanoparticle at each stage. The overall negative surface charges
of the p(HEMA-ran-GMA)-based nanoparticles in comparison
to the positively charged Cy5-PGMA nanoparticles (+39 mV) may be explained
by the presence of hydroxyl groups (−OH) on the nanoparticle
surface that dissociate readily in an aqueous medium.

Although
all the nanoparticle variants stated in Table 1 were highly monodispersed as discerned from
the polydispersity indexes (PDI) values, it was apparent that the
hydrophilic p(HEMA-ran-GMA)-based nanoparticles were
larger in size than the Cy5-PGMA nanoparticles. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of both Cy5-PGMA and Cy5-p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles are also provided in Figure 1A,B, respectively, to show the size differences.
The augmented sizes of p(HEMA-ran-GMA)-based nanoparticles
could be attributed to the hydrophilic material capacity to swell
when hydrated unlike the hydrophobic PGMA-based nanoparticles. Additionally,
it should be noted that the p(HEMA-ran-GMA) chains
within the aqueous micelles in the W/O emulsion were cross-linked
based on theoretical calculations that involved a coupling of ∼50
mol % of epoxide groups. It may be possible that increasing the cross-linking
density within the polymer chains could have led to changes in a nanoparticle
size; however, this was not attempted for this study. Previous studies
have demonstrated that the size of the nanoparticles synthesized from
W/O emulsions may be controlled by factors such as the water content
in the aqueous phase, type of solvent used in the organic phase, choice
of a surfactant (or a co-surfactant), and concentrations of the reagents
used.19 In AOT-stabilized W/O spontaneous
inverse nanoemulsions, it has been also suggested that the Wo ratio (Wo = [water]/[AOT]
in an organic solvent) could play a role in controlling the nanoparticle
size. No significant changes in the hydrodynamic size of the unfunctionalized
and cross-linked p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles were
detected when the Wo ratio was varied
from 0.5 to 10 while keeping the cross-linking density consistent
with the addition of 50 mol % ethylene diamine (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). This lack of size
variability with changing Wo suggests
that this system may be more dependent on the combined effects of
the solvent, surfactant, and polymer concentration in the aqueous
phase as the driving factors that govern a nanoparticle size from
the emulsion. As a result, it was determined that Wo = 10 was suitable for this nanoparticle synthesis system
based on the economy of the reagent used and yield of nanoparticles
achieved per batch.

analysis (TGA) (in red), and heat flow assessment was performed using
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (in blue) over a temperature
range of 25 to 380 °C under inert conditions.

The thermal analysis of a polymeric material
extracted from the W/O emulsions with and without the addition of
ethylene diamine was conducted using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure 1C) to assess the cross-linking capacity of
ethylene diamine. From the TGA plots (in red), a delayed inflection
point of the decomposition at 270 °C in the sample prepared with
the addition of ethylene diamine suggests successful cross-linking.
Furthermore, at approximately the same temperature, this material
exhibited an endothermic reaction (+52.32 J/g at 271 °C) as observed
by the DSC plots (in blue) compared to the sample prepared without
ethylene diamine. Taken together, it could be inferred that ethylene
diamine effectively assisted in coupling epoxide functional groups
on the polymer backbone, resulting in discrete cross-linked p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles within the AOT-stabilized micelles
in the W/O emulsion.

Cytotoxicity of Cy5-p(HEMA-ran-GMA) and Cy5-PGMA nanoparticles in a biologically relevant human
breast cancer model using MCF-7 cells was assessed in vitro using
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay over a course of 72 h, using various
nanoparticle concentrations up to 1 mg/mL. All nanoparticle formulations
were nontoxic across concentrations tested except for the Cy5-PGMA
nanoparticles at the highest concentration of 1 mg/mL (Figure 2A). Confocal imaging of MCF-7
cells incubated with Cy5-functionalized nanoparticles showed that
the cells sequestered both nanoparticle types (Figure 2B). The literature has stated that nanoparticle
surface characteristics such as surface charge and hydrophobicity
may be key requisites for cellular uptake.20 With cell membranes being negatively charged, it is widely accepted
that the probability for positively charged nanoparticles to be internalized
by cells is much higher. In tandem, confocal images of the MCF-7 cells
incubated with equal concentration (20 μg/mL) of nanoparticle
variants appeared to indicate preferential accumulation of the Cy5-PGMA
nanoparticles within the cell body in comparison to Cy5-p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles.

optical slices focused on the nuclear membrane (scale bars = 20 μm).

DOX was loaded into both Cy5-conjugated
nanoparticle variants used in this study by a backfilling method that
has been detailed in Section 2.6 of the
Supporting Information. This technique was chosen to keep the drug
loading method consistent between both Cy5-conjugated p(HEMA-ran-GMA) and PGMA nanoparticles that were synthesized by
two different emulsion techniques. The backfilling of DOX was also
an attractive option as it limits the exposure of the drug to reaction
conditions necessary for nanoparticle synthesis, which could potentially
affect drug activity (i.e., alkaline pH and elevated temperature).21 High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
was used to assess the loading efficiency of DOX and the drug release
profiles from the nanoparticle variants (Figure 3). It was observed that the loading of DOX
in Cy5-p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles (∼14%
w/w) was significantly higher than that in Cy5-PGMA nanoparticles
(∼0.3% w/w). The higher drug loading efficiency in Cy5-p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles may be explained by the enhanced
interaction of the water-soluble drug with the hydrophilic nature
of the HEMA groups in the base material, p(HEMA-ran-GMA). This explanation was further supported by the assessment of
the release of DOX from both the nanoparticle variants. DOX-loaded
Cy5-PGMA nanoparticles depicted a “burst” effect that
almost instantaneously released more than 50% of loaded DOX, suggesting
that the aqueous DOX interacted poorly with the hydrophobic core of
the Cy5-PGMA nanoparticle, preferentially releasing the therapeutic
contents into the exposed aqueous environment. The release profile
of DOX from Cy5-p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles was
more sustained and gradual in comparison (over several days), suggesting
that drug release from the DOX reservoir within the hydrophilic nanoparticle
core could be dependent solely on diffusion by a concentration gradient
with respect to the volume of the external aqueous sink (Figure 3). Correspondingly,
a relevant study revealed that DOX release from p(HEMA) nanoparticles
was controlled by the swelling capacity of the hydrophilic polymeric
material, which varied with pH.22 Although
it was critical for various studies based on pH-responsive drug delivery
vehicles to report the effects of pH on DOX release,23−26 drug
loading and release assessments conducted for these backfilled nanoparticle
variants designed for passive accumulation at tumorigenic sites were
limited to a normal physiological pH of 7.4.

chromatography (HPLC) (sink volume = 10 mL; 200 μL sample assessed

The therapeutic
efficiency of the DOX-loaded nanoparticle variants compared to free
drug was assessed in vitro to determine their half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) in the MCF-7 cell line (Figure 4). The IC50 is a
fundamental quantitative measure in pharmacology to indicate the potency
of a drug in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function.27 After 24 h incubation of the DOX-loaded nanoparticles
in MCF-7 cells, it was revealed that DOX-Cy5-PGMA nanoparticles had
a significant higher IC50 than both free DOX and DOX-Cy5-p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles. Although the IC50 of
DOX-Cy5-p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles was lower than
that of free DOX, the difference was not statistically significant
(see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).
Despite the outcome from this short term in vitro experiment, it is
anticipated that the p(HEMA-ran-GMA)-based nanoparticle
could have added advantages in vivo due to the EPR effect as well
as the sustained release of the DOX from the nanoparticles over several
days. (Figure 3: DOX release data represented with respect to time in hours).
To obtain the desired 50% inhibitory effect by DOX-Cy5-PGMA nanoparticles,
it was extrapolated from the DOX loading data (refer to inset graph
in Figure 3) that an
amount above the toxic threshold of the nanoparticle was required
(1131.33 μg/mL). Therefore, the use of DOX-Cy5-PGMA nanoparticles
developed in this study would not be recommended for therapeutic use
as nanoparticle-associated cytotoxicity could override any inhibitory
effect of DOX. As such, the IC50 determined from DOX-Cy5-PGMA
nanoparticles may not be an accurate representation. In comparison,
a therapeutic effect could be observed with a substantially smaller
concentration (1.63 μg/mL) of DOX-loaded p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles. These data suggest that the biocompatible and
hydrophilic p(HEMA-ran-GMA)-based nanoparticles can
be highly effective in encapsulating and delivering water-soluble
chemotherapeutics such as DOX for noninvasive treatment.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study demonstrates
the development of a hydrophilic polymer nanoparticle synthesized
using a water-soluble copolymer, p(HEMA-ran-GMA),
employing a W/O spontaneous inverse nanoemulsion. These hydrophilic
nanoparticles are biocompatible at therapeutically relevant concentrations
with the capacity for high drug loading of the water-soluble chemotherapeutic,
DOX. The hydrophilicity of the nanoparticles coupled with sustained
drug release could potentially enable prolonged circulation in systemic
conditions such that uptake at tumorigenic sites via the EPR effect
may be possible. The study has also confirmed the incompatibility
of utilizing a hydrophobic polymeric nanoparticle such as the PGMA-based
nanoparticle for the loading and delivery of water-soluble therapeutic
agents.

Experimental Section
p(HEMA-ran-GMA) Random Copolymer
Synthesis and Characterization
HEMA and GMA monomers were
used in the ATRP synthesis of p(HEMA-ran-GMA). The
random copolymerization reaction was carried out under Schlenk conditions
at 80 °C for 2 h, with the addition of copper(I) bromide and
2,2-bypyridine. (4-Morpholino)-ethyl-2-bromoisobutyrate was added
as an initiator. Purified p(HEMA-ran-GMA) was characterized
by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gel permeation
chromatography (GPC).

Nanoparticle
Synthesis and Characterization
PGMA
Nanoparticle Synthesis
One hundred milligrams of PGMA was
dissolved in the 1:3 mixture of chloroform and methyl ethyl ketone
to form 8 mL of the organic phase. This was added dropwise into the
aqueous phase with vigorous stirring made up of 30 mL of 1.25% w/v
Pluronic F-108 in Milli-Q water and sonicated extensively. An aqueous
suspension of PGMA nanoparticles was retrieved by removing all solvents
under the reduced pressure at 40 °C.

p(HEMA-ran-GMA) Nanoparticle Synthesis
One hundred milligrams of p(HEMA-ran-GMA) (100 mg)
was dissolved in 4 mL of Milli-Q water and added to a mixture of 17
g of sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate in 250 mL of dry hexane to obtain
an optically clear and homogeneous emulsion with moderate stirring.
Forty-two microliters of 1:100 ethylene diamine was added to the emulsion
and allowed to react overnight at room temperature. The cross-linked
p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles were retrieved by disrupting
the emulsion with the addition of excess Milli-Q water and centrifugation.
p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles were purified by dialysis
against Milli-Q water overnight.

Cy5 Functionalization of Nanoparticles
Both PGMA and p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles were subjected to amine functionalization
with excess aqueous ammonia before the Cy5 functionalization using
Cy5-NHS ester. Fluorescent Cy5-conjugated nanoparticles were purified
by dialysis against Milli-Q water.

Nanoparticle Characterization
Synthesized nanoparticles
were characterized using dynamic light scattering, fluorescence measurements,
and transmission light microscopy. Cy5-conjugated, cross-linked p(HEMA-ran-GMA) nanoparticles were additionally assessed using
thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry.

Doxorubicin Loading and Release
Assessments
Nanoparticle variants were backfilled with doxorubicin
according to detailed procedures outlined in the Supporting Information. Drug loading and release profiles
at physiologically relevant conditions (37 °C, pH 7.4) were assessed
using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a UV/vis
detector by an isocratic solvent system consisting of 0.02 M phosphate
buffer (pH 5.4) and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 10 mL/min, to detect
the doxorubicin peak at a retention time of 2 min at 233 nm.

Culture of MCF-7 Cells
MCF-7 cells
(human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, ATCC) were cultured in minimum
essential media α (MEM α, Gibco) supplemented with 0.15%
sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1× GlutaMAX
and were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Cytotoxicity Assessment
Cytotoxicity assessments and cell growth inhibition assessments
were carried out on cultured MCF-7 cells (106 cells/well)
in 96-well plates by the MTS assay using the protocol as described
by the manufacturer (Promega CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay). The absorbance of the colored formazan product
generated by viable cells was assessed on a plate reader at 490 nm.

Confocal Imaging
MCF-7 cells
were seeded (5 × 104 cells/well) on poly(l-lysine)-treated cover slips (10 mm) in 24 well plates with 500 μL
of culture media per well and allowed to settle overnight. Cy5-conjugated
nanoparticle variants (20 μg/mL in 100 μL of culture media)
were added in duplicate to the respective wells and incubated for
24 h. To fix the cells in each well, media were removed, cell layers
were washed with 1× PBS twice, and then 4% w/v paraformaldehyde
in 1× PBS was added for 15 min. After removing the fixative,
the cover slips in each well were washed twice with 1× PBS before
permeabilizing the cells in each well with 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 in
1× PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The permeabilized solution
was removed, and each well was washed twice with 1× PBS before
the addition of the 2% v/v donkey serum in 0.5% Triton X-100 solution
(2% DKS) to block the cells for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies recognizing
mouse βIII-tubulin (1: 500) in 2% DKS were added to each well
and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After removing the primary antibodies,
Hoechst stain (1:2000) and AF555 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(1:1000) in 2% DKS were added to each well and incubated in the dark
at room temperature for 20 min. Prepared samples on cover slips were
washed twice with 1× PBS and mounted onto glass slides for confocal
imaging using spectral properties of DAPI (cell nucleus), AF555 (microtubules
in cytoskeleton), and Cy5 (nanoparticles).
