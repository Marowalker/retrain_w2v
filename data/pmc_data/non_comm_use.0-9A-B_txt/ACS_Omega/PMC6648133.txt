Fuel cells hold great promise for
clean and sustainable energy,
whereas their widespread commercialization strongly depends on the
development of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Herein,
three-dimensional fluffy PtPd nanocorals (NCs) loaded on two-dimensional
(2D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) supports were successfully achieved
by a simple one-step strategy based on ultraviolet (UV) laser-excited
photochemical reaction. As for alcohol oxidation reaction, the h-BN/PtPd
NCs with unique nanoporous surface provide more enhanced electrocatalytic
performances than many previous nanocatalysts, owing to abundant active
sites and plentiful charge-transfer channels formed on high electrode–electrolyte
contact area. Especially, the mass activity of h-BN/PtPd NCs is about
962.8 mA mgPtPd–1 in methanol oxidation
reaction in alkaline solution, which can be maintained at ∼274.9
mA mgPtPd–1 (28.6% of the initial one)
even after a 5 × 104 s durability test. The present
work not only offers an advanced electrocatalyst for long-term fuel
cells but also provides a versatile route for construction of complex
metallic nanocomposites on 2D supports, holding great potential for
diverse energy-related applications.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
fuel cells have been extensively developed as clean and
sustainable energy sources, which are deeply dependent on the design
of highly efficient and stable novel nanostructured electrocatalysts.1−16 Although monometallic platinum (Pt) nanocatalysts possess excellent
catalytic activity, the widespread commercialization has been severely
hampered by skyrocketing prices and reduced active sites (self-poisoning
originated from the strong CO-like intermediate adsorption on Pt surfaces).1−3,6,8,12,16−20 To simultaneously minimize Pt utilization and improve electrocatalytic
performances, extensive research efforts have been undertaken toward
the development of Pt-based nanocomposites with specific structures,15−30 including bimetallic PtPd nanoparticles with dendritic, hollow,
or polyhedral shapes,5,10,15−25 PtAg nanourchins,26 interconnected Pt95Co5 nanowires,2 multilayered
PtNi nanotube arrays,27 PtCu nanoalloys,4,7 starlike PtAu nanocrystals,3 etc. Among
these interesting catalysts, three-dimensional (3D) dendritic PtPd
with a nanoporous structure has served as an emerging efficient catalyst,
attracting tremendous attention in recent years. The unique fluffy
nanoarchitectures can not only have enhanced synergistic effects due
to negligible lattice mismatch of Pt and Pd crystalline structures
but also possess abundant active sites and plentiful charge-transfer
channels formed on high electrode–electrolyte contact area.5,10,21

Meanwhile, in addition
to the Pt-based specific nanostructures,
another urgent issue should be also considered for further improving
electrocatalytic activity and stability. The water-dispersed nanocatalysts
that are generally used in fuel cells tend to be aggregated and agglomerated
together during electrochemical reaction, which will drastically reduce
the electrode–electrolyte contact area and significantly decelerate
the transportation of electrons. Recently, to address the aggregation
of nanocatalysts, tremendous efforts have been devoted to support
Pt-based nanocatalysts on two-dimensional (2D) materials, including
graphene nanosheets (GNs), graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide
(RGO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs), etc.11,13−15,22,24,27,31−38 However, it has also been recognized that severe corrosion/degradation
of these 2D supports will occur in long-term applications, owing to
the fact that graphene-based structures (GNs, GO, RGO, CNTs, or GNPs)
are generally unstable to oxidation–reduction reaction in alkaline
or acidic mediums. Such a process will result in chemical defects
and accelerate the segregation/dissolution of metallic catalyst, which
is harmful to maintaining its catalytic activity during a long-term
electrochemical reaction. Alternately, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)
with outstanding chemical and thermal stability should serve as a
promising stable support.14,39 In fact, h-BN covered
with certain metals can significantly enhance the inherent catalytic
activity of the metal, owing to the band structure modulations.14,39,40 Most recently, an interesting
work has illustrated that the hydrogen adsorption energy was significantly
changed from −2.51 V for single h-BN to −0.25 V for
h-BN/Pt composite.14 So, h-BN nanosheets
should be an ideal alternative support for the design of highly efficient
and stable electrocatalysts.

Taken together, if the fluffy PtPd
nanodendritic architectures
can be effectively loaded on h-BN nanosheets, the novel nanocomposites
will possess both the structural advantage of 3D nanoporous surfaces
and excellent stability of 2D supports, providing an unpredicted opportunity
for maximizing the electrocatalytic performance. Up to now, this fascinating
nanocomposite has not been achieved through traditional syntheses,
such as hydrothermal/solvothermal method, chemical reduction reaction,
electrochemical deposition, etc. owing to the fact that the wide band
gap (>3.6 eV) insulated h-BN is generally stable under heat or
with
oxidation agents. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a rational
strategy to fabricate such advanced nanocomposites, which are more
desirable for fuel cell applications.

Herein, we propose a novel
and versatile approach for the direct
large-scale overgrowth of 3D fluffy PtPd nanocorals (NCs) on h-BN
supports by ultraviolet (UV) laser (405 nm) excitation of 2D nanosheets
in K2PtCl4 and Na2PdCl4 mixed solution. The difference from traditional chemical synthesis
is that the photoexcited electron–hole pairs on h-BN surface
can provide effective reduction of Pt and Pd ions, dominating the
nucleation of bimetallic PtPd in this work. The large-scale formation
of “pure” and “clean” h-BN/PtPd nanocomposites
does not require any polymer stabilizers/capping/structure-directing
additives in this synthesis, avoiding the complex extra purification
process used in conventional approaches to eliminate residual agents
absorbed on nanoproducts. As well known, nanocatalysts with inevitable
residual agents on surfaces will suffer from degradation of the electrocatalytic
activity toward practical fuel cell applications. As expected, the
as-prepared h-BN/PtPd NCs with pure surface and unique fluffy nanoporous
surface structures exhibit excellent catalytic activity and superior
durability toward alcohol (methanol and ethanol) oxidation reactions.
As for MOR in alkaline solution, the mass activity of h-BN/PtPd NCs
is about 962.8 mA mgPtPd–1 and can be
maintained at ∼274.9 mA mgPtPd–1 even after chronoamperometry (CA) for 5 × 104 s,
which is better than that of many previous PtPd-based nanocatalysts.
The present work will provide an insightful way to load metallic nanocomposites
on chemically stable 2D supports, which is beneficial to develop advanced
catalysts for various energy-related applications.

2 Results and Discussion
Two-dimensional h-BN is composed
of numerous irregular-shaped nanosheets
(Figure S1), and the absorption band of
the milk-white h-BN solution is located at the UV region (Figure S2a). Two absorption peaks at ∼320
and ∼385 nm can be detected for K2PtCl4 solution, whereas that for Na2PdCl4 is at
∼429 nm (Figure S2b). So, the adopted
UV laser beam with a wavelength of 405 nm can be effectively absorbed
by h-BN solution, resulting in strong excitation of h-BN nanosheets
and then the generation of electron–hole pairs on surfaces.
Therefore, the excited electron can be used for reduction of Pt2+ and Pd2+ ions, leading to the nucleation of bimetallic
PtPd on h-BN supports. The milk-white color of the mixed solution
(h-BN, K2PtCl4, and Na2PdCl4) changed into gray and then to dark black after 30 and 60 min irradiation
(Figure 1a), resulting
in the enhanced broad adsorption at 400–1000 nm (Figure S2c). The morphologies of the nanoproducts
were carefully investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images in Figure 1b–d.
It can be found that many multibranched networks were completely loaded
on the h-BN, resulting in the formation of 3D rugged and porous nanocorals
on 2D support (Figure S3a). The enlarged
TEM image in Figure S3b confirms that these
coral-like nanostructures are mainly composed of ultrasmall interconnected
nanoparticles with average size of ∼5.6 nm from the TEM image.
On the other hand, high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM)
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) experiments are shown
in Figure S4. Clearly, the metallic structures
with an obvious contrast can be easily distinguished from the h-BN
support. The corresponding elemental mapping images show that the
B and N elements are homogeneously distributed on the nanoproduct,
whereas the island isolation of Pt and Pd elements implies the anisotropic
overgrowth process during laser irradiation. On the basis of the elemental
mapping images in Figure S4, the relative
ratio of Pt to Pd elements is about 1.1:0.9, which is proportional
to the initial Pt2+/Pd2+ molar ratio (∼1:1)
in a precursor solution. Moreover, the high-resolution TEM image in Figure 1e provides the typical
structural detail of the cross region between PtPd and h-BN supports.
Because of the interconnected lattice fringes formed at boundary regions,
the PtPd nanocorals (NCs) indeed accreted on h-BN nanosheets, instead
of a physical mixture of two different nanostructures. The estimated
lattice spacing distance of 0.332 nm (green region) is ascribed to
h-BN (002) plane, and the d-spacing of 0.225 nm (blue
region) is located between theoretical values of (111) lattice plane
of Pt (0.237 nm) and Pd (0.224 nm), corresponding to the (111) plane
of PtPd alloy.

h-BN/PtPd
solutions fabricated by a 405 nm laser irradiation of h-BN nanosheets
in Pt and Pd ion solutions. (b–d) TEM images of h-BN/PtPd NCs
with different magnifications. (e) The HRTEM images of the cross region
of h-BN nanosheets and PtPd NCs. The insets show the crystal structures
of h-BN support and PtPd NCs. The irradiation time was 60 min.

Then, the obtained h-BN/PtPd nanoproducts
were further illustrated
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS). The SEM images in Figure 2a–d clearly reveal that these h-BN
nanosheets were completely covered by plenty of 3D PtPd NCs with highly
porous and fluffy surfaces. The enlarged SEM images (Figure 2e) clearly confirm that these
PtPd NCs with obvious 3D aggregated multibranched nanoarchitectures
were loaded on the 2D supports. Compared with the original h-BN with
smooth surfaces (Figure S5), the fluffy
h-BN/PtPd NCs should possess a significantly larger surface area,
which is beneficial to improve their electrocatalytic performance.
The EDS analysis in Figure 2f shows that the obtained nanomaterials are only composed
of B, N, Pt, and Pd elements without any other contamination. The
calculated atomic ratio of Pt to Pd is 5.21:5.24, which is also close
to the result (Pt/Pd ∼ 1.01:1) obtained by the inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement. Therefore,
it is confirmed that the composition of PtPd nanocomposites is directly
proportional to the initial Pt2+/Pd2+ molar
ratio (∼1:1) in the precursor solution.

of as-prepared h-BN/PtPd NCs at different
regions. (f) The corresponding EDS pattern of the products.

On the basis of photon-induced
excitation of electron–hole
pairs, the large-scale synthesis of h-BN/PtPd NCs is highly related
to the laser wavelength. We found that the overgrowth of PtPd alloys
would be significantly reduced if other longer wavelengths were used
in this experiment. As shown in Figure S6a–c, the PtPd alloys on h-BN supports drastically decreased with an
increase of the laser wavelength (450, 532, and 633 nm). Moreover,
the color of solution (Figure S6d) slightly
turned to light gray by a 633 nm laser irradiation, which is significantly
lighter than that obtained by the 405 nm laser irradiation. On the
other hand, the relative ratio of Pt to Pd elements in h-BN/PtPd can
be simply controlled by changing the initial Pt2+/Pd2+ molar ratio in the reaction solution. To verify it, two
different reaction solutions were prepared by using Pt2+/Pd2+ of 1:3 and 3:1, respectively. The interconnected
granular nanostructures with unobvious branches were formed on h-BN
support by using Pt2+/Pd2+ of 1:3 (Figure S7a,c), and the relative ratio of Pt to
Pd elements is calculated to about 2.65:8.98 (Figure S7e). The increasing Pt content (Pt2+/Pd2+ of 3:1) can result in the construction of branched nanostructures
with Pt/Pd of 6.63:2.17 (Figure S7b,d,f), due to the higher oxidizability of Pt2+ in comparison
with Pd2+ ions. If only Pt or Pd ions were separately added
in two h-BN solutions, h-BN/Pt or h-BN/Pd nanoparticles (NPs) can
be solely obtained, according to this paper. As shown in Figure S8a,b, the highly interconnected Pt nanoparticles
were aggregated with each other, forming a fibrous-shaped structure
on h-BN support. As for h-BN/Pd NPs in Figure S8c,d, some irregular and granular-like isolated Pd nanoparticles
sporadically support on h-BN. The obtained h-BN/Pt and h-BN/Pd NPs
are separately illustrated by SEM images and EDS analyses in Figure S9a–d. It can be seen that the
aggregated Pt in h-BN/Pt NPs is about 3.88% and isolated Pd in h-BN/Pd
is 2.33%. Finally, metallic compositions in these above nanoproducts
(h-BN/PtPd NCs, h-BN/PtPd NPs) have been also verified by ICP-MS analyses
in this work.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure 3a show the detailed
crystal structures of
original h-BN nanosheets, h-BN/PtPd NCs, h-BN/Pt, and h-BN/Pd NPs.
There is only one peak at 26.7° for h-BN nanosheets (dark gray
curve), attributing to (002) plane (JCPDS, no. 73-2095). For the other
three samples, the diffraction peak of h-BN(002) crystal structure
can be well maintained after overgrowth of metallic structures on
the supports. It can be deduced that the single-crystalline nature
of h-BN support cannot be damaged by laser-induced overgrowth. On
the other hand, the diffraction peaks (cyan curve) of h-BN/Pd NPs
detected at 40.0, 46.5, 67.9, 81.8, and 86.3° can be ascribed
to the face-centered cubic planes of Pd structures (JCPDS, no. 88-2335).
Similarly, h-BN/Pt NPs possess four other peaks (blue curve) at 39.7,
46.2, 67.4, and 81.2°, originating from Pt crystals (JCPDS, no.
04-0802). Finally, the XRD pattern (orange curve) of h-BN/PtPd NCs
illustrates that the diffraction peaks at 39.8, 46.4, 67.8, and 81.7°
are located between the standard positions from pure Pt (JCPDS, no.
04-0802) and Pd (JCPDS, no. 88-2335) crystalline, confirming the formation
of alloyed PtPd nanocrystals. Moreover, Raman spectra of these four
samples (Figure 3b)
show the evolution of 2D supports after overgrowth of metallic nanomaterials.
There is only one Raman peak at 1373 cm–1, which
should be directly related to the well-known zone-center, counterphase
B–N vibrational mode (E2g) peak of h-BN structure.41−43 After laser-excited overgrowth of metallic nanomaterials, the 2D
h-BN support can be well maintained since there is no shift of E2g mode. It can be concluded that there is no damaging effect
on the 2D h-BN support (single-crystalline and hexagonal structure)
during laser-excited overgrowth of Pt and Pd nanomaterials on the
surfaces.

NCs, h-BN/Pt, and h-BN/Pd NPs, respectively.

To further evaluate the surface compositions and chemical
states
of h-BN/PtPd NCs, h-BN nanosheets, h-BN/Pd, and h-BN/Pt NPs, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out. The full
survey XPS spectra (Figure 4a) show that all of these four samples have N 1s peak at 398.7
eV and B 1s peak at 190.5 eV as well as the weak C 1s peak at 284.8
eV.44−47 Moreover, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Pt 4f for h-BN/Pt NPs
and h-BN/PtPd NCs are displayed in Figure 4b. By using the Gaussian–Lorentzian
fitting method, the Pt 4f spectra can be deconvoluted into two couples
of peaks (olive line and blue line), representing two valence states
of atomic Pt0 and ionic Pt2+, respectively.
The stronger peaks of Pt 4f for h-BN/PtPd NCs detected at 71.47 and
75.02 eV are assigned to the binding energies of atomic Pt0 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. As for h-BN/Pt
NPs, the doublet peaks of Pt0 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 were measured at 71.70 and 75.03 eV, respectively. It can
be calculated that the peak of Pt0 4f7/2 (71.47
eV) for h-BN/PtPd NCs experiences a negative shift of ∼0.23
eV in comparison with that (71.70 eV) of h-BN/Pt NPs. On the other
hand, the other pair peaks are found at 72.15 and 76.85 eV, which
can be attributed to ionic Pt2+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. Similarly, the high-resolution XPS spectra
of Pd 3d for h-BN/Pd NPs and h-BN/PtPd NCs can be also deconvoluted
into two components (Figure 4c, cyan line and magenta line). The stronger peaks of Pd 3d
for h-BN/PtPd NCs at 335.64 and 340.96 eV can be attributed to atomic
Pd0 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, whereas the
paired peaks located at 336.40 and 341.91 eV should be assigned to
ionic Pd2+ 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively.
As for h-BN/Pd NPs, atomic Pd0 3d5/2 and Pd0 3d3/2 can be detected at 335.51 and 340.53 eV,
respectively. So, atomic Pd0 3d3/2 (340.96 eV)
for h-BN/PtPd NCs exhibits a positive shift of 0.43 eV as compared
with h-BN/Pd NPs. In this way, the negative shift of Pt0 4f7/2 and positive shift of Pd0 3d5/2 are simultaneously observed in h-BN/PtPd NCs, owing to the electron
transfer from Pd to Pt atoms via atomic diffusion at the interfaces.17,27,48 Since Pt is more electronegative
than Pd, the electron density around Pt atom will be increased by
this unique electron-transfer process,48 resulting in the stronger electronic interaction and synergistic
effect between Pt and Pd atoms in the h-BN/PtPd NCs. Moreover, the
increased electron density around Pt will also lead to a downshift
of the d-band center of Pt by partial filling of the Pt 5d bands,27 giving rise to the change of work function and
Fermi energy of Pt atoms.17 As illustrated
in previous works,17,27,48 the modified PtPd alloys can significantly decrease the absorption
of poisonous CO-like intermediates on electrocatalyst, which is helpful
for the realization of higher electrocatalytic performance.

NPs, respectively. (a) Survey spectra, (b, c) metallic Pt and Pd spectra.

On the basis of the above discussions,
the obtained h-BN/PtPd NCs
are expected to provide excellent electrocatalytic performance. So,
the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of this nanocatalyst were recorded
in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution by sweeping the electrode
potential from −0.2 to 1 V at a sweep rate of 50 mV s–1. For comparison, other four samples, including h-BN/Pt and h-BN/Pd
NPs, as well as commercial Pt/C (20 wt % Pt) and Pd/C (10 wt % Pd)
catalysts were also selected. The metal loadings of the different
materials were accurately determined by ICP-MS measurements. As shown
in Figure 5a, it can
be seen that the peak intensities and areas of h-BN/PtPd NCs are higher
and larger than that of other four nanocatalysts. Moreover, on the
basis of the charge collected in hydrogen adsorption/desorption, the
electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) values of these five
samples are shown in Figure 5b. In detail, the ECSA of h-BN/PtPd NCs, h-BN/Pt and h-BN/Pd
NPs, as well as commercial Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts are 38.8, 33.3,
7.4, 24.7, and 12.1 m2 g–1, respectively.
Moreover, CV curves and corresponding ECSA values of the two other
nanocatalysts, including h-BN/Pt3Pd1 and h-BN/Pt1Pd3 nanomaterials (the subscript indicates the
Pt/Pd atomic ratio) were also obtained (Figure S10a,b). We found that the optimal Pt/Pd composition of 1:1
in h-BN/PtPd NCs provides higher ECSA values in comparison with the
two other conditions. As illustrated in previous works,42,49−52 the optimized metallic composition of h-BN/PtPd NCs can provide
an enhanced synergistic effect between Pt and Pd atoms, showing a
promising potential for improving electrocatalytic activity.

Figure 5 (a) CV curves
of as-prepared h-BN/PtPd NCs, h-BN/Pt, and h-BN/Pd
NPs, as well as commercial Pt/C (20 wt % Pt) and Pd/C (10 wt % Pd)
catalysts in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. (b) The
corresponding ECSA results calculated for CV curves.

Then, MOR tests of these five samples were performed
in acidic
(0.5 M H2SO4) and alkaline (1 M KOH) mediums,
respectively. For MORs in acidic medium, each CV image in Figure 6a contains two oxidation
peaks, including a forward peak and a backward peak. The oxidation
peak observed in the forward sweep corresponds to the direct oxidation
of methanol molecules, which is usually regarded as an important parameter
to elucidate the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts.49−52 The mass activity and specific activity of these five samples (Figure 6b) reveal that h-BN/PtPd
NCs provide enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward MORs in an acidic
solution. For instance, the mass activity of h-BN/PtPd NCs is about
540.3 mA mgPtPd–1, which is much higher
than that of the other four samples. Additionally, MORs in an acid
solution based on the two other nanocatalysts, including h-BN/Pt3Pd1 and h-BN/Pt1Pd3 nanomaterials,
were also performed (Figure S10c). It can
be found that the h-BN/PtPd NCs with the Pt/Pd composition of 1:1
also provide higher mass activity in comparison with the two other
samples. As for MORs in an alkaline solution, similar evolutions of
these five nanocatalysts are observed in CV curves (Figure 6c,d). Especially, the mass
activity of h-BN/PtPd NCs is about 962.8 mA mgPtPd–1, which is about 2.16, 10.84, 4.33, and 7.23 times
higher than that of h-BN/Pt, h-BN/Pd, and commercial Pt/C and Pd/C,
respectively. On the other hand, the five samples were also used for
the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) shown in Figure S11. The obtained h-BN/PtPd NCs also provide the highest
electrocatalytic activity toward EORs in either acidic or alkaline
mediums in comparison with the other four nanocatalysts. For instance,
the mass activity of h-BN/PtPd NCs is about 1462.8 mA mgPtPd–1 toward EOR in alkaline solution, which is about
5.4 times and 13.4 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (271.7
mA mgPt–1) and Pd/C (108.9 mA mgPd–1), respectively. Moreover, we have compared
the electrocatalytic activity of h-BN/PtPd NCs with many previous
reports, as shown in Table S1. It is confirmed
that the obtained h-BN/PtPd NCs with enhanced mass activity are more
suitable for MORs and EORs.

Figure 6 (a–d) CV curves and mass activities of
five nanocatalysts
toward 0.5 M CH3OH in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH solutions. The five nanocatalysts include h-BN/PtPd
NCs, h-BN/Pt, and h-BN/Pd NPs, as well as commercial Pt/C and Pd/C
catalysts.

The excellent electrocatalytic
activity is related to the plentiful
porous PtPd structures formed on h-BN support, which is expected to
possess much higher surface area.53−56 Then, the nitrogen (N2) adsorption–desorption isotherm of the h-BN/PtPd NCs was
obtained, which is the combination of type I and type IV isotherms
(Figure 7a). The type
I isotherm is related to the steep rise at low relative pressures
(P/P0 < 0.001), which
is a characteristic feature of microporous (<2 nm) materials.57−59 The type IV isotherm is derived from the hysteresis loop at higher
relative pressures (P/P0 > 0.50), indicating a typical mesoporous (2–50 nm) structure.57−59 Moreover, the pore-size distribution curve can be obtained from
the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm by using the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method.53−55 As shown in Figure 7b, the pore distribution
of h-BN/PtPd NCs is relatively narrow and mainly centered at ∼3.66
nm. Additionally, the h-BN/PtPd NCs also possess abundant micropores
with an average pore size of ∼0.54 nm (inset in Figure 7b). For comparison, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of original h-BN nanosheets
and commercial Pt/C catalysts were also obtained (Figure S12). There only exists a type IV isotherm with a hysteresis
loop at higher relative pressures of 0.9 < P/P0 < 1, implying the presence of slit-shaped
mesopores due to aggregation of flakelike particles.60 On the basis of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method,56 the specific surface area
of h-BN/PtPd NCs is calculated as about 753.01 m2 g–1 whereas that of Pt/C and h-BN is 24.88 and 21.87
m2 g–1, respectively. More importantly, Table S2 provides the detailed comparison of
BET surface areas of h-BN/PtPd NCs to many previous works. Compared
with the existing reports (20–350 m2 g–1), the fluffy h-BN/PtPd NCs possess much larger surface area, which
will dramatically increase electrode–electrolyte contact area
for the electrochemical reaction. Meanwhile, the 3D abundant nanopores
formed on h-BN/PtPd NCs can also improve the transmission of electrons
during an electrochemical reaction, which is helpful for realizing
high catalytic efficiency. Figure S13 shows
the electrochemical impedance spectra of different nanocatalysts,
including the obtained h-BN/PtPd NCs, bimetallic PtPd nanoparticles
(Pt/Pd ∼ 1:1), and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The electric
resistance of h-BN/PtPd NCs is significantly lower than that of Pt/C
catalysts, resulting in much rapid charge-transfer rates. The abundant
micro and small mesopores formed on h-BN/PtPd NCs can provide unique
ultrafast electrically conductive channels, which not only obviously
shorten the diffusion lengths for electrolyte ions but also significantly
accelerate the electronic transmission for the electrochemical reaction.
Therefore, the unique 3D fluffy nanoporous structures loaded on h-BN
supports would be of great benefit for increasing catalytic efficiency.

h-BN/PtPd NCs. (b) The corresponding pore-size distribution curve

Besides the excellent electrocatalytic
activity, the obtained h-BN/PtPd
NCs should also possess high long-term durability, which is another
essential indicator for practical use of nanocatalysts in fuel cells.
Therefore, chronoamperometry (CA) measurement of the h-BN/PtPd NCs
was performed at the constant potential of −0.2 V in alkaline
condition. For comparison, h-BN/Pt and h-BN/Pd NPs, as well as commercial
Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts were also adopted in CA measurements. As for
the entire time course (5 × 104 s) in Figure 8a, the current density of h-BN/PtPd
NCs is obviously much higher than that of the other four samples.
Especially, the residual current density of h-BN/PtPd NCs can be maintained
at ∼274.9 mA mg–1 (28.6% of the initial one)
even after 5 × 104 s long-term durability tests (the
inset in Figure 8a),
which is already ∼200 times higher than that of the commercial
Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. Moreover, Figure 8b provides the variation of the peak current
density of h-BN/PtPd NCs during 500 repeated tests and the corresponding
CV curves after different cycles. Clearly, the residual current density
is ∼923.5 mA mg–1 after 500 cycles, implying
that 96% electrocatalytic activity can be maintained. In addition,
SEM and TEM images of the h-BN/PtPd NCs after 5 × 104 s tests are also displayed in Figure 8c,d. Although there are a few inevitable aggregated
PtPd NCs, most of the obvious multibranches can be also maintained
during such long-term tests. Moreover, the corresponding ICP-MS measurement
and XPS pattern of this sample after 5 × 104 s tests
were also carried out in this work. The ICP-MS result shows that the
calculated atomic ratio of Pt to Pd is about ∼1.08:1, which
is consistent with that of the initial nanoproducts. The pronounced
stability of h-BN/PtPd NCs is further confirmed by XPS spectra of
Pd and Pt species in Figure S14a–c that are very similar to the result of original nanocomposites.
More significantly, we have compared electrocatalytic durability of
h-BN/PtPd NCs with many previous excellent nanocatalysts, as illustrated
in Table S3. Obviously, the detailed comparison
confirms that the residual current density (∼274.9 mA mgPtPd–1) of h-BN/PtPd NCs after 5 × 104 s tests is far better than that of many previous reports
(<250 mA mg–1 after <1 × 104 s). We assume that the enhanced electrocatalytic durability should
be related to hydroxyl (−OH) groups formed on the h-BN/PtPd
NCs in alkaline condition. First, to confirm the formation of −OH
groups on nanocatalysts in alkaline solution, the CV measurements
of the five nanocatalysts in KOH conditions are then displayed in Figure S15a. Besides the hydrogen adsorption/desorption
potential region at a range of −0.85 to −0.6 V, a distinctive
forward peak at about −0.22 V can be also formed in the CV
curves. It is attributed to the formation of Pd–OH structure,
which has been well verified in a previous work.61 Moreover, the forward peak intensity of h-BN/PtPd NCs is
much higher than that of the other four catalysts, implying that much
more −OH groups were formed on the surfaces. Before and after
MORs in alkaline and acidic mediums, the Fourier transformed infrared
spectra (FTIRs) of h-BN nanosheets and h-BN/PtPd NCs are illustrated
in Figure S15b. As for h-BN/PtPd NCs, the
characteristic spectrum of −OH groups at ∼3470 cm–1 can be significantly increased after MORs under an
alkaline condition, suggesting the enhanced adsorption of −OH
groups. Second, the contributions of −OH groups for improving
electrocatalytic durability were analyzed in this paper. For comparison,
CA measurements in acidic solutions were carried out, as illustrated
in Figure S16a. Each current density sharply
decreases within 5000 s, which is much lower than that in alkaline
condition. For instance, the current density of h-BN/PtPd NCs in acidic
solution drastically decreases from ∼659.4 to 84.23 mA mg–1; only 12.6% of the initial value can be maintained
after 5000 s. Moreover, there is a significant loss of ∼ 49%
after 500 cycles in acidic condition (Figure S16b) whereas ∼4% in alkaline medium. As illustrated in previous
works,6,61 the formation of −OH groups on nanocatalysts
can give rise to removal of poisonous CO-like intermediates adsorbed
on their surfaces62 and enable achievement
of higher electrocatalytic durability in alkaline media as compared
to that under the acidic condition, which is also coincident with
our case. To verify this, the ratio of forward current density (If) to backward current density (Ib) was obtained in this work. A higher If/Ib ratio implies an improved
complete oxidation process in the forward scan.2,8,12,15,31,53,54,56,63 As shown in Figure S17, If/Ib of h-BN/PtPd NCs is 1.71
under an alkaline condition whereas 0.85 in an acidic medium. It is
implied that the abundant −OH groups formed on h-BN/PtPd NCs
can facilitate the removal of poisonous CO-like intermediates and
release the occupied active sites in the subsequent reaction, resulting
in high long-term electrocatalytic durability. On the basis of the
above discussions, the excellent catalytic activity and durability
of h-BN/PtPd NCs should be summarized into the following aspects:
(1) The clean and pure surface of h-BN/PtPd NCs fabricated by a laser
photochemical reaction in the absence of any polymer or surfactants
can benefit the electrocatalytic performance. (2) The enhanced intermetallic
synergies between Pt and Pd atoms in h-BN/PtPd NCs are believed to
improve the intrinsic properties of each component. (3) The increased
electrode–electrolyte contact area originated from the unique
3D fluffy nanoporous structures loaded on h-BN supports provides abundant
charge-transfer channels for boosting electrocatalytic activity. (4)
The abundant −OH groups formed on h-BN/PtPd NCs can facilitate
the removal of poisonous CO-like intermediates adsorbed on this nanocatalyst
and therefore improve the catalytic performance. In summary, the obtained
h-BN/PtPd NCs with excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term
durability should be established as an advanced nanocatalyst for diverse
electrochemical reactions.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel versatile strategy for
direct overgrowth of highly porous fluffy PtPd NCs on h-BN nanosheets
by UV laser irradiation of 2D supports in Pt and Pd ions solution.
The effective reduction and nucleation of metallic ions on 2D supports
should be dominated by the generation of photon-excited electron–hole
pairs on the semiconductor surface. The obtained h-BN/PtPd NCs provides
excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability. Especially,
the mass activity of h-BN/PtPd NCs is about 962.8 mA mgPtPd–1 in MORs in an alkaline medium and maintained
at ∼274.9 mA mgPtPd–1 (28.6% of
the initial one) even after 5 × 104 s long-term tests.
So, the obtained h-BN/PtPd NCs can serve as an advanced electrocatalyst
in fuel cell applications. Moreover, the laser-excited synthesis can
be also extended to the overgrowth of other complicated metallic nanostructures
on chemically stable 2D supports.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
The pure h-BN nanosheets
were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).
K2PtCl4 and Na2PdCl4 were
obtained from Macklin Biochemical Industry Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China),
and ethanol was purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.
Nafion (5 wt %) ethanol solution was bought from Sigma-Aldrich Chem
Co. Commercial Pt/C with 20 wt % Pt loading and Pd/C with 10 wt %
Pd loading were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Industry Co., Ltd
(Shanghai, China). All other reagents were of analytical grade and
directly used as supplied.

4.2 Synthesis of h-BN/PtPd
Nanocomposites
First, 0.01 g of h-BN powder was diluted into
20 mL of distilled
water to form a uniform h-BN solution by 10 min of ultrasonic vibration.
In a typical synthesis procedure of h-BN/PtPd nanocorals (NCs), 500
μL of 15 mM K2PtCl4 and 500 μL of
15 mM Na2PdCl4 solution were simultaneously
added in a glass dish with 1 mL of ethanol and 3 mL of as-prepared
h-BN solution. The added ethanol molecules serving as a sacrificial
agent can be oxidized to ethylal by consuming photoinduced holes,64,65 to prolong the electron–hole pairs’ lifetime. Under
magnetic stirring, the mixed solution was irradiated by a 405 nm laser
beam with power of 700 mW and average diameter of 2 cm. After a 60
min irradiation, the obtained solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm
for 10 min in an ultracentrifuge. For comparison, four other kinds
of catalyst h-BN/Pt, h-BN/Pd, h-BN/Pt1Pd3, and
h-BN/Pt3Pd1 nanomaterials (the subscript indicates
the Pt/Pd atomic ratio) were also prepared using a similar method
only by adjusting the ratio of K2PtCl4 and Na2PdCl4. In detail, 500 μL of a 15 mM K2PtCl4 solution was added to prepare h-BN/Pt nanoparticles
(NPs) whereas 500 μL of a 15 mM Na2PdCl4 solution was added to prepare h-BN/Pd NPs. To prepare h-BN/Pt1Pd3 NPs, 250 μL of 15 mM K2PtCl4 and 750 μL of 15 mM Na2PdCl4 solution
were added. To prepare h-BN/Pt3Pd1 NPs, 750
μL of 15 mM K2PtCl4 and 250 μL of
15 mM Na2PdCl4 solution were added.

4.3 Characterizations
The as-prepared
precipitates were dropped onto carbon-coated copper mesh and completely
dried in an oven for observations of morphologies and crystal structures
by using a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM).
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis and high-angle
annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) were used to identify
the elemental composition of the complexes. Morphologies and chemical
compositions of the samples were also characterized by a field emission
scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) equipped with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The phases of as-prepared products were
determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Rigaku, RINT-2500VHF)
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Raman spectra
were recorded on a LabRAM HR 800 spectrograph with a 633 nm laser
beam excitation source at room temperature. The absorption spectra
were recorded on a UV–vis–IR spectrometer (UV-1800,
Shimadzu). The detailed surface compositions and element valencies
were measured using X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis, which
was carried out with PHI Quantera SXM equipped with an Al Kα
= 280.00 eV excitation source. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured on an ASAP 2020 HD88 instrument, and samples
were degassed for 12 h at 220 °C under vacuum before measurements.
The actual loading and composition of Pt and Pd on the h-BN nanosheets
were determined by PerkinElmer NexION 300X inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS).

4.4 Electrochemical Characterizations
All electrochemical experiments were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical
workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrumental Co., Ltd, China) using
a standard three-electrode system. The working electrode is a glassy
carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) modified with as-prepared
catalytic materials. The counter electrode is a carbon black electrode,
and a saturated calomel electrode is the reference electrode. In a
typical electrochemical test, 2 mg of products were dispersed in a
1 mL mixed solution of water and 5 wt % Nafion with a 9:1 ratio in
volume by ultrasonic oscillation. Five microliters of sample suspensions
were dropped on glass carbon electrode and dried naturally at ambient
temperature. For comparison, 2 mg mL–1 commercial
Pt/C (20 wt %) and Pd/C (10 wt %) suspensions were prepared by the
same process mentioned above. Before modification with a catalyst,
each GCE was sequentially polished with 1 μm diamond powder
and 0.05 μm α-Al2O3. Typical cyclic
voltammetry (CV) was obtained in 0.5 M H2SO4 or 1 M KOH solution at a sweep rate of 50 mV s–1. Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) was conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4/1 M KOH and 0.5 M CH3OH; ethanol
oxidation reaction (EOR) was conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4/1 M KOH and 0.5 M C2H5OH. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were made in the frequency
range of 0.01–105 Hz at 0.24 V with an alternating
current amplitude of 5 mV. All electrochemical measurements were carried
out at ambient temperature.
