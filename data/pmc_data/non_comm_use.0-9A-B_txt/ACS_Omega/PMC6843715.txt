Dystrophia myotonica type 1 (DM1) results from
nuclear sequestration of splicing factors by a messenger RNA (mRNA)
harboring a large (CUG)n repeat array
transcribed from the causal (CTG)n DNA
amplification. Several compounds were previously shown to bind the
(CUG)n RNA and release the splicing factors.
We now investigated for the first time the interaction of an aliphatic
polycarbonate carrying guanidinium functions to DM1 DNA/RNA model
probes by affinity capillary electrophoresis. The apparent association
constants (Ka) were in the range described
for reference compounds such as pentamidine. Further macromolecular
engineering could improve association specificity. The polymer presented
no toxicity in cell culture at concentrations of 1.6–100.0
μg/mL as evaluated both by MTT and real-time monitoring xCELLigence
method. These promising results may lay the foundation for a new branch
of potential therapeutic agents for DM1.

==== Body
Introduction
Steinert disease, also
known as myotonic dystrophy type 1 and dystrophia
myotonica type 1 (DM1), is the most common hereditary muscular dystrophy
affecting adults, with a prevalence of 1:8000 in Caucasians.1 DM1 results from a mutation in the dystrophia
myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene on chromosome 19, position 19q13.32.2 This mutation is the amplification of the (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat located in the 3′
untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The disease clinically develops
above 50 (CTG) repeats, and the higher the repeat number, the more
severe the form. DM1 is a multisystemic disorder, and the symptoms
include myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles), progressive muscle
weakness and wasting, insulin resistance, cardiac conduction defects,
neuropsychiatric symptoms, gonadal atrophy, and early cataract.3

The transcription of the (CTG)n triplet
expansion in (CUG)n repeats, makes DM1
the first recognized example of an RNA-mediated disease. This pathological
RNA is retained in the nucleus of affected cells, forming typical
double-stranded hairpin structures.4 The
complete physiopathology is still not fully understood but mainly
affects two splicing factors: muscle-blind-like protein family (whose
MBNL1 is the major one) and CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1). These
antagonistic proteins are fundamental in the alternative splicing
regulation of pre-mRNAs.5,6 MBNL1 is sequestered
by the double-stranded hairpin RNA, in typical ribonuclear inclusions
(foci). The loss of MBNL1 function is directly linked
to myotonia7 and insulin resistance,8 while on the other hand, the overexpression and
stabilization of CUGBP1 could induce muscle wasting.9

To this date, no treatment is available for DM1.
The present major
therapeutic strategies are focused on (i) blocking the (CTG)n repeat expansion in the mutated gene, avoiding its
transcription,10 (ii) suppressing or blocking
the (CUG)n RNA and/or its structural hairpins,11,12 (iii) overexpressing the sequestered splicing factors,1,13−15 and (iv) suppressing (CTG)n repeat by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.16,17

So far, antisense technology designed to block the (CUG)n repeat on RNA appears to be of limited efficacy
(synthetic siRNA,18 antisense oligonucleotides,19 and so forth). Small bioactive molecules (low
molecular-weight structures or peptoids20,21) binding to
either the (CTG)n expansion on the DMPK
gene10 or to the (CUG)n RNA (inhibiting interactions with MBNL1) are considered as
potential therapeutic agents. Recently, López-Morató
et al.22 reviewed the current knowledge
about the effectiveness of such molecules. Pentamidine (PTMD, Figure 1) was the first small
molecule tested for this purpose, and it provided good initial results,23 however hampered by its high toxicity in vivo
at therapeutic levels, preventing clinical applicability. Analogues
inspired from PTMD structure and mechanism of action were then considered.
Indeed, we recently showed the effectiveness of 1,2-ethane bis-1-amino-4-benzamidine
(EBAB, Figure 1) that
presented a similar activity with a much lower toxicity in vivo than
PTMD.24 In this molecule, the pentyl diether
chain of PTMD was replaced by an ethyl diamine chain.

molecules. MTC-Boc-Guan (monomer), P(Guan)

To the best of our knowledge, (synthetic or natural) polymers have
not yet been considered as potential therapeutic compounds for DM1
treatment. However, the development of polymers for biomedical applications
has been one of the most challenging topics of the past decades, more
particularly for drug delivery.25 Polymers
are mostly used as nanocargo vehicles, enhancing the bioaccessibility
and efficacy of therapeutic agents, reducing the drug dosage and toxicity.
Positively charged polymers were already shown to bind phosphate groups
of oligonucleotides through electrostatic interactions.26−28 Inspired from PTMD, we considered the design of a biocompatible
polycation that should lead to an innovative bioactive material, potentially
able to interact with (CUG)n or (CTG)n repeats. The polymer chain could bring improved
biocompatibility and biodegradability compared to PTMD. Also, the
insertion of different functional groups onto the chain could further
modulate its features, such as tailored bioavailability and remanence
in the body.

Synthetic aliphatic polycarbonates (APCs) are good
candidates for
biomedical applications, being biodegradable into nontoxic products29,30 and biocompatible.31,32 The main advantage of APCs is
their ease of functionalization before or after the polymerization,
yielding specifically designed macromolecules able to overcome biological
barriers.33,34 Playing with the type and number of chemical
functionalities (e.g., via copolymerization), their electrostatic
charge, hydrophobicity, and degradability (amongst others) could be
further tuned.

Ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates
(CCs) is
one of the most relevant ways to design APCs.35 ROP can be achieved using metal-free catalysts,36 considerably simplifying the costly and time-consuming
postpolymerization purification steps. This synthetic pathway avoids
residual metals linked to toxicity.37 Among
organic catalysts, the amidine 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU) promotes the ROP of CCs by activation of the initiating alcohol
in a pseudo-anionic polymerization mechanism. This
“super”-base was proven to be noncytotoxic.38 CC monomers were synthesized based on the route
suggested by Pratt and co-workers,39 starting
from 2,2-bishydroxy(methyl)propionic acid (bis-MPA) (synthetic scheme
available in the Supporting Information). Various functions could be attached through this monomer synthesis,
taking into account their possible interaction or DBU catalyst deactivation
during polymerization.

Inspired by the PTMD structure, and by
several investigations of
polymer–oligonucleotide interaction,40−42 we decided
to prepare CC monomers carrying guanidine functions (MTC-Boc-Guan, Figure 1). As guanidines
could interact during the ROP process, they were protected using tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) groups. The deprotection was
done in a postpolymerization treatment before use. The resulting charged
polycation (P(Guan), Figure 1) could interact with the negative charges of the oligonucleotides.

We first wanted to evaluate the interaction between the P(Guan)
polymer and the (CUG)n repeat RNA by studies
in vitro. Potentially active ligands in DM1 are usually identified
through screening techniques by investigating nucleic acid (DNA/RNA)-drug
interactions using target probes with pathological triplet repeat
expansions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and fluorescence
microscopy are often used for such purposes.

Recently, capillary
electrophoresis (CE) has been successfully
implemented in the study of various types of interactions,43−45 but it is still underused for nucleic acid–ligand interaction
assessment.46 Among various electromigration
techniques available for such interaction studies, affinity CE (ACE)
is particularly useful. It implies the use of a pair of compounds,
acting arbitrarily as ligands or analytes. The ligand is added to
the running buffer, constituting a pseudostationary phase, whereas
the analyte is injected as a sample. The dynamic interaction between
the two will decrease the electrophoretic mobility of the analyte
and consequently its migration time. The binding constant is determined
based on the change in the migration time as a function of ligand
concentration. A main advantage of ACE in comparison with other affinity-based
liquid chromatographic techniques is the small volume requirements
of both the ligand and the analyte, which significantly reduces costs
and widens product accessibility. Furthermore, the high separation
efficiency enables the measurement of binding constants even for low-purity
analytes. The possibility of ACE automation is another valuable asset
for the screening of large libraries of compounds.46,47

In a previous study, we demonstrated the usefulness of ACE
for
the screening of small ligands in DM1.24 The developed method confirmed the high affinity of PTMD and of
its novel synthetic analogue, EBAB, toward the (CUG)50 probe.
Nevertheless, a repetition of 50 CUG is borderline for the clinical
manifestations of DM1, and it is not fully representative for the
disease. Furthermore, Coonrod et al.10 recently
proved that PTMD may have its therapeutic effect by acting on DNA
(CTG)n repeats, inhibiting transcription.
On the basis of these findings, we propose to improve the disease
model by synthesizing longer RNA targets ((CUG)95) and
extending the tests to DNA (CTG)95 targets as well. Both
pure (CTG)95 fragment and (CTG)95 contained
in a linearized plasmid were considered as DNA targets. The previously
developed ACE method was used for testing these “DM1-like”
probes.

Like for PTMD, the cellular toxicity of P(Guan) remained
a key
parameter to assess. Its positive charge could induce interaction
with membranes causing their lysis. In that regard, Cho et al.48 proved the strong effect of a polymer charge
density on hemagglutination. On the other hand, Frère et al.49,50 proved the noncytotoxicity of polycarbonate copolymers carrying
guanidinium functions (by classical colorimetric test able to assess
cell viability and hemocompatibility assays). In the present study,
we evaluated cytotoxicity both by MTT assay (endpoint label-based
viability readout) and real-time monitoring of cell viability by the
xCELLigence system.

Considered as a relevant preliminary test
for the assessment of
polymer toxicity and biocompatibility, MTT assay is based on the metabolic
reduction of tetrazolium salt into formazan crystals. Once dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), this purple compound can be quantified
by spectrophotometry and its concentration reflects the number of
metabolically active cells. The xCELLigence system allows for continuous
measurement of impedance variations in the function of cell growth
or death, using culture plates containing gold microelectrodes.51

To sum up, this research work aimed to
evaluate in a first trial
the ability of a bioactive polymer to act as a therapeutic agent in
DM1. As a proof of concept, the binding constants between an aliphatic
polycarbonate carrying guanidinium functions (P(Guan)) and DNA (CTG)95/RNA (CUG)95 were measured using an ACE technique
and compared to reference compounds (namely PTMD and EBAB). The cytotoxicity
of the polymeric material was evaluated in parallel via MTT assays
and real-time monitoring xCELLigence.

Results and Discussion
Polymer
Synthesis
As a novel research strategy for
DM1 treatment, we synthesized an aliphatic polycarbonate carrying
guanidinium functions with the aim to evaluate this polycation binding
to DNA/RNA model probes with amplified CTG/CUG triplet repeats. The
CC monomer carrying protected (Boced) guanidine was prepared starting
from bis-MPA, following a synthetic route inspired from Pratt et al.39 In this route, safer ethyl chloroformate and
triethylamine (TEA) replaced triphosgene for performing the ring closure
(synthetic scheme and protocol available in the Supporting Information). The pure monomer obtained was subsequently
dried before its use for polymerization (MTC-Boc-Guan, yield = 60%, 1H NMR available in the Supporting Information, Figure S4).

The macromolecular chain was synthesized via
ROP, organo-catalyzed by DBU, and initiated by benzyl alcohol. We
aimed for a short homopolymer with 10 repeat units (P(Boc-Guan), Figure 2). After quenching
of the polymerization reaction, the material was purified by precipitation
in iso-propanol from concentrated solution of dichloromethane
(DCM). The polymer was characterized by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC, Figure 2) and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 3). The purification efficacy (elimination of small
molecules and oligomers) was highlighted on the SEC profile (Supporting Information, Figure S5).

Figure 2 Synthesis pathway
of the P(Guan) polycation and SEC chromatogram
of P(Boc-Guan) after purification by precipitation in iso-propanol from DCM before deprotection. Molar masses are equivalent
to polystyrene standards.

The SEC chromatograms depicted a monomodal molar mass distribution
with a dispersity index of 1.39 and a molar mass of 3.9 kDa (equivalent
to polystyrene standards, Figure 2). This high dispersity index, contrary to the ones
usually observed for APCs obtained by ROP (around 1.2), indicated
a poor polymerization control. Investigation of possible side-reactions
led to the identification of undesired initiation from other compounds
than benzyl alcohol (e.g., water traces). Therefore, the polymer batch
contained several macromolecular populations of lower molar mass than
targeted.

The 1H NMR spectrum after purification
confirmed the
presence of protected guanidine functions all along the polymer backbone,
as well as the absence of residual catalyst or monomers (Figure 3). Setting the integration
of the ethyl of BzO-peaks equal to 2 (Ph–CH2–O–, δ = 5.13 in CDCl3) was chosen for the calculation of the repeat unit number
(degree of polymerization). Polymer peak integrations were thus calibrated
in accordance with the benzyl alcohol peaks. After calculation, the 1H NMR data indicated a polymer carrying 30 units of Boced
guanidine, with a subsequent molar mass of 12 kDa. Those figures were
largely superior to SEC results and confirmed the presence of multiple
macromolecular species in the polymer batch. As no other initiator
was detected on 1H NMR, we suspected that polymerization
had started from a diol corresponding to the opened monomer form.

Figure 3 1H NMR of P(Boc-Guan) in CDCl3 after purification
by reverse precipitation in cold iso-propanol, confirming
the Boced guanidine functions carried by the aliphatic backbone.

Despite a higher dispersity and the lack of end-chain
fidelity,
we obtained a short oligomer of polycarbonate carrying lateral guanidines.
We estimated that this P(Boc-Guan) was suitable for a proof of concept
study. Nevertheless, the polymerization control should be improved
for future experiments. To be able to interact with oligonucleotides,
P(Boc-Guan)’s guanidine functions were deprotected using trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA). The deprotection effectiveness was confirmed by 1H NMR, with the disappearance of Boc group signals at δ = 1.49
ppm (Supporting Information, Figure S6).

Application of the ACE Method to the Newly Synthetized DM1-like
Probes
We previously used ACE to investigate the binding
of PTMD and synthesized derivatives on a commercially available (CUG)50 RNA probe.24 However, as mentioned
in the introduction, a (CUG)50 array is not completely
representative of DM1 heterogeneity. In order to better model the
pathology, we used conventional biomolecular techniques such as transcription
in vitro to obtain (CUG)95 RNA, and purification of a (CTG)95 DNA restriction fragment from a plasmid amplified in Escherichia coli. To evaluate nonspecific interactions,
we also used the whole linearized plasmid. The three nucleic acid
probes were quality checked by agarose gel electrophoresis (data not
shown).

In the first set of experiments, the three nucleic acid
probes were run in CE in identical conditions to assess their mobilities
in the absence of a ligand (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Electropherograms of: (A) linearized plasmid containing
(CTG)95; (B) purified (CTG)95 DNA fragment;
and (C) purified
(CUG)95 RNA. Conditions: 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH = 7.4;
sample plug 50 mbar × 5 s. Fused silica capillary dynamically
coated with PEO. Ltot = 40 cm, Leff = 31.5 cm, potential: −15 kV; nucleic
acid targets: 200 μg/mL.

In the second set of experiments, sequential ACE assays were performed
for each nucleic acid probe with increasing concentrations of the
ligand (PTMD or EBAB, in the range of 0–200 μM) added
into the running buffer. The migration times were processed using
nonlinear regression as the fitting procedure (Supporting Information, Figures S7 and S8), offering better
accuracy and precision compared to linear regression.52−54

The binding constant (Ka) of PTMD
with
(CUG)95 RNA was similar to, although, as expected, slightly
higher than the one previously obtained with the (CUG)50 RNA probe (Table 1, Ka = 16.30 × 103 M–1). This confirmed the adequacy of the new RNA probe
as a DM1-model. The smaller affinities of PTMD toward the plasmid
(Ka = 8.82 × 103 M–1) and purified (CTG)95 DNA fragment (Ka = 4.60 × 103 M–1) indicated a preferential interaction with the RNA probe. In addition,
an almost two-fold higher binding constant was found for (CTG)95 DNA within the plasmid as compared with the purified DNA
fragment indicating the presence of additional, nonspecific interactions
with other parts of the plasmid sequence.

The nontoxic PTMD derivative EBAB presented a similar affinity
as PTMD for the (CUG)50 RNA probe (Table 1). In the present study, EBAB bound the longer
(CUG)95 RNA probe with about four-fold higher Ka (53.42 × 103 M–1),
than the shorter (CUG)50 RNA. The affinity was thus higher
for EBAB than PTMD in the same conditions. Moreover, among the two
reference ligands, EBAB probably showed the highest specificity in
the interaction with (CTG)95 DNA, based on the similar Ka obtained with both the plasmid (Ka = 9.96 × 103 M–1)
and purified DNA (Ka = 9.56 × 103 M–1) fragment.

Affinity studies performed
with P(Guan) polycation revealed a binding
constant to (CUG)95 RNA slightly higher (Ka = 22.50 × 103 M–1)
than PTMD, and about half the Ka recorded
for EBAB. Also, P(Guan) demonstrated a strong interaction with the
linearized (CTG)95 plasmid, yielding a 4-fold higher Ka (36.83 × 103 M–1) than reference compounds. On the other hand, P(Guan) interaction
with the purified (CTG)95 DNA fragment yielded a 15-fold
lower Ka value (2.45 × 103 M–1), indicating additional nonspecific interactions
with the plasmid backbone.

Cytotoxicity Evaluation
As the positive
charges all
along the P(Guan) polymer backbone could induce interaction with phospholipids
and disruption of cell membranes, its potential cytotoxicity was investigated.
We used HeLa cell cultures and complementary techniques to evaluate
live cell numbers, i.e., MTT assay (endpoint label-based) and impedance-based
real-time monitoring cytotoxicity assay (xCELLigence system).

To the best of our knowledge, no experimental protocol has been reported
on the evaluation of polymers by the xCELLigence method. To make sure
that the studied polymer did not alter results and the skew cell index
measure by a role on the measured impedance, P(Guan) was incubated
in the absence of cells at the highest tested concentration (100 μg/mL)
in plate wells. Even if the polymer itself gave a slightly positive
value, its impact was negligible and considered as not interfering
(profile available in the Supporting Information, Figure S9).

In the xCELLigence protocol, 24 h HeLa cell proliferation
was followed
by exposure to P(Guan). The important peak observed 3–5 h after
treatment in the cell index profiles is common and can be ascribed
to manipulation stress, as it is observed for nontreated cells as
well (Figure 5, green
curve).

Figure 5 Cell viability performed by MTT assay and real-time monitoring
(xCELLigence) on HeLa cells in the presence of P(Guan). In MTT, cell
viability was expressed as % (in comparison to the control = nontreated
cells). In xCELLigence, cell index derived from impedance measurements.
After 24 h of incubation, HeLa cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of P(Guan) added to the culture medium (see Methods). Control curve (green line) represents
nontreated cells.

The cytotoxicity data
obtained by either technique were in good
agreement (Figure 5), indicating no statistically significant cytotoxicity of P(Guan)
in the tested range of concentrations.

When dried solvents were required, DCM, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and
toluene were dried using a MBraun Solvent Purification System (model
MB-SPS 800) equipped with alumina drying columns. Molecular sieves
(4 Å) were washed three times using THF and dried overnight under

All materials used for polymerization were properly dried and stored
in a glove box before use. EBAB was synthesized as described.55 Ultrapure deionized water (18.2 MΩ) was
used for the preparation of all working solutions and buffers (Milli-Q
Reference Water Purification System, Merck). A 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)
buffer solution was used for the dissolution of the ligands (stored
at −4 °C). Daily fresh aliquots were prepared from (∼1

All working solutions were passed through 0.2 μm pore size Spartan
syringe filters (Whatman) and degassed by sonication for at least
5 min before use. For the dynamic coating of the bare fused silica
capillary, a PEO coating solution was used as previously described.24

Synthesis
Nucleic Acid Probes
The nucleic acid targets were synthesized
and purified in our laboratory. In brief, the RNA target was synthesized
using an in vitro transcription kit (HiScribe SP6 RNA Synthesis Kit,
New England Biolabs). The template plasmid, containing the (CTG)95 insert (provided by Dr. Denis Furling, Institute of Myology,
Paris, France) was linearized using HindIII (Invitrogen
by Thermo Fisher Scientific AnzaTM) restriction enzyme before in vitro
transcription.

The plasmid containing the (CTG)95 DNA target was amplified after bacterial transformation. It was
extracted using the ZymoPURE Plasmid Gigaprep kit (Zymo Research).
A part of the produced plasmid was linearized with HindIII, purified by ethanol precipitation, and used as such for the
ACE experiments.

The second part of the plasmid preparation
was cut with HindIII and XhoI to
release the (CTG)95 DNA fragment. The digestion products
were separated by preparative
gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel (using an in-house built system).
A thin gel lane was cut on either side of the gel, stained with ethidium
bromide, and visualized under UV light to identify the (CTG)95 DNA fragment. The nonstained central gel part containing the fragment
of interest was then cut out and DNA extracted from the agarose gel
slice using an in-house electrodialysis system. Finally, the DNA (CTG)95 fragment was reprecipitated with ethanol from the extraction
buffer.

CC Monomers
All steps leading to the carboxylic acid
CC (MTC-COOH) are available in the Supporting Information, including the 1H NMR spectra (Figures
S1–S3).

All of the next steps were done under nitrogen
flow. MTC-COOH (1 g, 1 equiv) was dissolved in 45 mL of anhydrous
THF with 3 drops of DMF (catalyst). A solution of 1.607 mL of oxalyl
chloride (3 equiv) in 5 mL of anhydrous THF was added dropwise at
0 °C and maintained under stirring for 1 h at RT. Volatile solvents
were then removed under vacuum. Anhydrous THF (50 mL) was added and
similarly evaporated to eliminate any trace of contaminants. The as-prepared
acyl chloride was dissolved in 50 mL of anhydrous THF. A solution
of 0.828 mL of TEA (0.95 equiv), 1.8 g of 1,3-diBOC 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)
guanidine (0.95 equiv), and 5 mL of THF were added dropwise at 0 °C.
The reaction was stirred for 3 h at RT. Residual salts were then filtered
off and volatiles were removed under vacuum. The crude product was
dissolved in chloroform (ca. 10 mL) and filtered through a weakly
acidic aluminum oxide bed (ca. 1 cm height). The column was then washed
with chloroform excess (ca. 100 mL). The solvent was finally eliminated
under vacuum to yield a white powder of 1,3-di-Boc-2-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanidine-5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxane-5-carboxylate
(MTC-Boc-Guan, yield = 60%). The product was dried overnight under
vacuum, at RT, and in the presence of P2O5 (a
water-catching agent). It was then stored under protective atmosphere
(N2) in a glove box. 1H NMR confirmed the absence
of interfering contaminant (Figure S4).

Ring-Opening Polymerization
All of the products (monomer,
catalyst, solvent, and quench agent) were carefully dried prior to
use as described in the Materials section.
The polymerization was done in a glove box (N2 atmosphere)
containing flame-dried glassware. In a vial, a solution of 200 mg
of MTC-Boc-Guan monomer (10 mol equiv) in 400 μL of DCM was
prepared and left under stirring with molecular sieves (monomer initial
concentration = 1 M). In another vial, a solution of 6.8 μL
of DBU (1 mol equiv) and 4.9 μL of BzOH (1 mol equiv) in 49
μL of DCM was prepared and maintained under stirring with molecular
sieves. The monomer solution was added to the catalyst/initiator solution,
and the polymerization mix was stirred until maximal conversion (about
1 h). The polymerization was then quenched with benzoic acid (5 mg/mg
of DBU). The polymer was concentrated and purified by multiple reverse
precipitations in cold iso-propanol to yield P(Boc-Guan)
as a colorless polymer. The material was dried overnight under vacuum
(RT) prior to analysis.

Postpolymerization Deprotection of Pendant
Boced Guanidine Functions
P(Boc-Guan) (100 mg) was dissolved
in 4 mL of anhydrous DCM. TFA
(1.2 mL) was slowly added and left under stirring for 1 h 30 min at
RT until the solution became cloudy. Volatiles were eliminated under
vacuum, and the deprotected polymer was dried overnight under vacuum
(RT) prior to analysis and use.

Methods
Polymer Characterization
SEC was performed in THF (98:2;
v/v) at 35 °C using an Agilent 1200 liquid chromatography system
equipped with a degasser, an isocratic pump, an autosampler (200 mL
loop), a set of two PLgel 10 mm MIXED-B ultrahigh-efficiency columns
using a differential refractive index, and a UV–vis detector.
A 100 mL sample solution in an eluent (concentration 0.1% w/v) was
injected. Molecular weight and molecular weight distribution were
calculated with reference to polystyrene standards (Polymer Laboratories).

1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or
in DMSO-d6, with tetramethylsilane as
an internal standard, at RT with a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer operating
at 500 MHz, equipped with a BBO probe. Spectra were obtained over
32 scans (sample concentration 10 mg/0.6 mL).

PEO-Coated
CE
The PEO-coated capillary was prepared
as described in the previous works.24,56 The experiments
were performed using an Agilent G1600 CE system (Agilent Technologies),
and the samples were injected hydrodynamically (50 mbar × 5 s).
The bare fused silica capillary was acquired from Polymicro Technologies.
All capillaries had an internal diameter of 50 μm, an external
diameter of 365 μm, and total length of 40 cm. Detection was
performed with the built-in diode-array detector at 260 nm.

Binding
Constant Evaluation
The samples were first
run in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and subsequently in the same buffer with
increasing concentrations (from 0 up to 200 μM) of the tested
ligand.24

The analyses were performed
in triplicate (n = 3) at a separation voltage of
−15 kV, and the detection was done at the characteristic UV
absorption maxima of the DNA/RNA probes (260 nm). Each ACE assay lasted
14 min with a total run time of 31 min (including the preconditioning
step). At each ligand concentration, the analyte electrophoretic mobility
was calculated based on its recorded migration time using formula 1. 1  where Lt is the
total capillary length, Leff is the effective
capillary length (the length up to the detector), tm is the analyte migration time, and V is the separation voltage.

The binding constant for each ligand
was assessed using nonlinear
regression, based on eq 2(57) 2  where Δμ is the difference in
the electrophoretic mobility for the analyte with either no ligand
or a given ligand concentration in the buffer, L is
the ligand concentration in the buffer, Kb is the binding constant, and Δμmax is the
maximum difference in electrophoretic mobility (in the absence or
presence of a ligand in the buffer), μ0 is the electrophoretic
mobility of the analyte with no ligand in the buffer, and μmax is the mobility of the analyte at the maximum ligand concentration,
above which there is no more mobility change.

For data analysis
and nonlinear regression fitting, Origin 2016
(OriginLab, trial version) was used.

Polymer Cytotoxicity Evaluation
The synthesized and
deprotected P(Guan) polymer was assessed for toxicity in HeLa cells
by an endpoint (MTT assay) and a dynamic (xCELLigence) method.

Cell
Culture
HeLa cells (cervix adenocarcinoma; ATCC
# CCL-2) were cultured in DMEM + GlutaMAX growth medium (Gibco, Fisher
Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS South American
(CE), Gibco, Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
mixture (PenStrep, Lonza). Culture plates were maintained in the incubator
under a humid atmosphere (37 °C, 5% CO2). A stock
solution of polymer P(Guan) was prepared (10 mg/mL) in distilled water.

MTT Assay
The cell viability was evaluated using thiazolyl
blue tetrazolium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) assay, which indicates the
metabolic activity of cells. The experiment was performed in 96-well
microplates seeded at a density of 5000 HeLa cells per well, and placed
in the incubator under a humid atmosphere (37 °C, 5% CO2). The polymer stock solution was diluted in medium (DMEM + 10% FBS
+ 1% PenStrep) to reach final concentrations ranging from 1.6 to 100
μg/mL.

After 24 h, 200 μL of the culture medium
was discarded from each well and replaced by 200 μL of each
polymer dilution (n = 3). Plates were then placed
back in the incubator for 24 h. Cells were then washed three times
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Gibco, Fisher Scientific) and
200 μL of the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide solution (0.5
mg/mL in PBS, pH = 7.4) was added to each well and left to incubate
for a further 4 h at 37 °C. The MTT reagent was thereafter removed
and formazan crystals formed in viable cells were dissolved in 100
μL of DMSO (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich). Microplates were shaken,
and each well absorbance was measured at 570 nm (Thermo Labsystems
Multiskan Ascent microplate reader).

Real-Time Monitoring of
Cell Viability Using xCELLigence
The experiments were performed
on an xCELLigence RTCA SP device (ACEA
Biosciences). During the first series of experiments, 100 μL
of DMEM + GlutaMAX growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin mixture was added in each well of the
device VIEW 16 E-Plate.58 A background
measure of impedance, converted into a cell index, was then performed.
Each well was seeded with 5000 HeLa cells suspended in 200 μL
of growth medium. After gentle mixing, cells were allowed to sediment
for 30 min at RT, and then the E-plate was put back in the RTCA analyzer.
Cells were cultured for approximatively 24 h, and an impedance measurement
was recorded every 15 min and converted into cell index, which is
representative of the cell viability.

The polymer stock solution
was diluted in culture medium to reach final concentrations ranging
from 3.1 to 100 μg/mL.

After 24 h, 100 μL of the
culture medium was discarded and
replaced with 100 μL of each polymer dilution in the culture
medium (between 0 and 200 μM, n = 3). Plates
were put back in the RTCA analyzer and the cell index was monitored
after treatment for a further 48 h.

Impedance monitoring of
polymer solutions without cells was also
performed to evaluate whether these macromolecules did not contribute
by themselves to the electrical impedance increase.

Conclusions
In the present study, we investigated by ACE two classes of compounds
(pentamidines and a polycation) for their binding affinity to nucleic
acids harboring triplet repeat arrays typical of DM1. Compared to
our previous publication,24 longer triplet
repeat arrays (95 triplets instead of 50), more representative of
the pathology, were used: linearized plasmid containing (CTG)95 array, purified (CTG)95 DNA fragment, and (CUG)95 RNA. Those longer “DM1-like” probes were first
shown by ACE to bind two reference compounds (PTMD and EBAB) with
high affinity. A better binding specificity was observed for EBAB
as compared to PTMD and confirmed a higher affinity of both compounds
toward (CUG)95 RNA versus (plasmid and purified fragment)
(CTG)95 DNA. This strong interaction, in addition to its
ability to decrease pathological (CUG)50 RNA foci in cell nuclei,24 again confirmed EBAB
as a candidate for further investigations in correcting the DM1 pathological
phenotype (rescue of abnormal RNA splicing in cell culture and DM1
model in vivo).

For the first time in the investigations of
potential therapeutic
strategies for DM1, a polycation P(Guan) was designed based on an
aliphatic polycarbonate carrying guanidinium functions, prepared by
organo-catalyzed ROP (Mn = 3900 g mol–1; Đ = 1.39). Even if the polymerization
process did not perform as expected in terms of control, the obtained
product could be used for a proof of concept experiment. Complementary
cytotoxicity tests (MTT assay and xCELLigence method) both proved
the nontoxicity of P(Guan) in the range of tested concentrations (1.6–100.0
μg/mL).

P(Guan)’s affinity for “DM1-like”
probes was
assessed by ACE and compared to the two reference molecules. The binding
of P(guan) to (CUG)95, the most representative nucleic
acid probes in terms of DM1 pathology, is noteworthy (Ka = 22.50 × 103 M–1).
This obtained Ka was slightly higher than
PTMD (16.30 × 103 M–1), and about
half of the Ka recorded for EBAB (53.42
× 103 M–1). On the other hand, P(Guan)
interaction with the purified DNA (CTG)95 (Ka = 2.45 × 103 M–1)
was weaker than with the linearized plasmid (Ka = 36.83 × 103 M–1), suggesting
the occurrence of additional nonspecific interactions with the plasmid
DNA (CTG)95.

As specificity for the triplet repeat
array is the ultimate goal
in the strategy, these initial findings should be evaluated in the
light of interactions with nontargeted DNA sequences. Several probe
templates should be tested, containing triplet arrays other than (CTG)n or (CUG)n. Also,
it would be interesting to compare Ka obtained
with plasmids having different length of (CTG)n, including a nonpathologic array, e.g., (CTG)15.

Considering the great versatility of polymer design, many
possibilities
are open in terms of macromolecular engineering. For instance, further
optimizing the type of cations (e.g., morpholino instead of guanidinium)
and tailoring the architecture (e.g., using spacing agents to “dilute”
the cationic charge) hold great promise in the improvement of interaction
specificity. The fine tuning of the repetitive units on the polymer
in better modeling specific reference molecules (e.g., EBAB) should
also lead to tailor-made polymeric materials.

Finally, the high
binding affinity of P(Guan) to (CUG)95 warrants further
studies to complete the biological characterization
in the DM1 context. The biodegradability profile of the polymer backbone
and its influence on activity and toxicity should be investigated.

Indubitably, if we confirm the potential activity of our polymeric
or nonpolymeric candidates, we have to evaluate the permeation performances
across biological barriers. Once the in vitro interaction is confirmed,
the next step consists of performing in vivo assays to evaluate the
concrete ability of our APCs to become a therapeutic strategy.
