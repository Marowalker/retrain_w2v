In this study, we
present the preparation of graphene quantum dots
(GQDs) and graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs). GQDs/GOQDs are prepared
by an easy electrochemical exfoliation method, in which two graphite
rods are used as electrodes. The electrolyte used is a combination
of citric acid and alkali hydroxide in water. Four types of quantum
dots, GQD1–GQD4, are prepared by varying alkali hydroxide concentration
in the electrolyte, while keeping the citric acid concentration fixed.
Variation of alkali hydroxide concentration in the electrolyte results
in the production of GOQDs. Balanced reaction of citric acid and alkali
hydroxide results in the production of GQDs (GQD3). However, three
variations in alkali hydroxide concentration result in GOQDs (GQD1,
GQD2, and GQD4). GOQDs show tunable oxygen functional groups, which
are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. GQDs/GOQDs show
absorption in the UV region and show excitation-dependent photoluminescence
behavior. The obtained average size is 2–3 nm, as revealed
by transmission electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction peak at around
10° and broad D band peak at 1350 cm–1 in Raman
spectra confirm the presence of oxygen-rich functional groups on the
surface of GOQDs. These GQDs and GOQDs show blue to green luminescence
under 365 nm UV irradiation.

1 Introduction
Graphene
is a single carbon atom thick layer, in which sp2 carbon
atoms are densely packed in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice.
It has exceptional electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties.
These properties of graphene are extensively used in various applications,
such as solar cells, supercapacitors, biosensors, and so forth.1,2

Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) or graphene oxide quantum dots
(GOQDs)
are zero-dimensional graphene/graphene oxide nanomaterials with remarkable
luminescence properties associated with edge effects or defect states
(i.e., surface states).3−6 Surface states enable excitation-dependent photoluminescence (PL)
behavior. Surface states, such as oxygen-rich functional groups, allow
GQDs to be dispersed in the solvents. As a result, GQDs/GOQDs have
a great potential toward optical and electrochemical sensing,7,8 photovoltaics,7 photocatalysis,8 bioimaging,9,10 biosensing,10,11 light-emitting diodes,12 and so forth.
These can be synthesized by top-down or bottom-up methods. Usually,
top-down methods cut carbon fibers, graphene sheets, graphene electrode,
graphite powder, plant materials, such as mango leaves, into GQDs/GOQDs,
respectively, by chemical oxidation and exfoliation,13 hydrothermal synthesis,14 electrochemical
synthesis,15 UV-assisted synthesis,16 and microwave synthesis.17 Bottom-up methods include molecular precursors (natural
or artificial) to construct GQDs/GOQDs by carbonization of citric
acid,18,19 cage-opening of fullerene,20 microwave carbonization and aromatization by acetylacetone,21 microwave-assisted hydrothermal process,22 microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polyethylene
glycol and saccharide,23 polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons,24,25 microwave-assisted heating of
carbon nanotubes,26 chemical exfoliation
of graphite nanoparticles,27 and so forth.

Most of the top-down techniques involve strong chemicals and tedious
synthesis protocols, whereas the bottom-up techniques, generally,
require special equipment and are time-consuming processes. Hence,
there is a need of a simple, efficient, and affordable method for
the synthesis of GQDs and GOQDs. In this work, we report a new facile
synthesis route to prepare GQDs and GOQDs from graphite rod via electrochemical
exfoliation, in which the electrolyte is a combination of a weak acid
and a strong alkali hydroxide. This methodology ensures an easy approach
toward the synthesis of GQDs and GOQDs, which is quite similar to
electrochemical preparation of tungsten disulfide quantum dots and
molybdenum disulfide quantum dots.28,29 The steps
for preparing the GQDs and GOQDs are essentially the same. The GOQDs
are obtained by varying the concentration of NaOH in the electrolyte.
The variation of the concentration of NaOH causes the predefined molar
ratio to vary. As a result, oxygen-rich functional groups are produced
in the GQDs, which are known as GOQDs. So, this electrochemical exfoliation
method is easy and able to produce very small GQDs and GOQDs with
the size of ca. 2–3 nm. The novelty of the present work is
generating defects on the surface of graphite rod by heating it at
high temperature. These defects facilitate the electrochemical exfoliation
process by providing more number of sites for oxidation and exfoliation.
Second, variation of NaOH concentration in the electrolyte results
in the production of GQDs/GOQDs with different structural and optical
properties.

2 Classification, Mechanism of GQDs/GOQDs Formation,
and Role of Anion
2.1 Classification of Prepared
GQDs Based on Electrolyte
Here, in the electrochemical setup,
two graphite rods were dipped
in the electrolyte. By varying the electrolyte concentration, quantum
dots with varying oxygen functionalization were formed. Classification
of prepared GQDs/GOQDs on the basis of electrolyte concentration is
shown in Table 1. For
the convenience of the readers, these four samples are referred in
the text as GQD1–GQD4.

Table 1 Electrolyte, Chemical
Reactions, and
Anion Distributions for Obtaining the GQD1–GQD4
GQD1, GQD2, GQD3, and GQD4 are obtained
with the predefined molar
ratios of citric acid to NaOH of 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4, respectively.
The obtained anion distribution is given in Table 1. For GQD1 and GQD2, we decrease the concentration
of NaOH to 1/2 and 2/3 times as compared to balanced reaction (GQD3).
For GQD4, we increase the concentration of NaOH to 4/3 times as compared
to balanced reaction (GQD3). By varying the concentration of NaOH
in the molar ratio, GOQDs (GQD1, GQD2, and GQD4) can be obtained.
The range of NaOH in the predefined molar ratio can be 1.5–4,
if the citric acid is constant at 1. Thus, GQD3 is GQDs, and GQD1,
GQD2, and GQD4 are GOQDs.

2.2 Mechanism: From Graphite
Rod to GQDs
Schematic illustration of the preparation of
GQDs by electrochemical
exfoliation process is shown in Figure 1. The bare graphite rods are taken as starting material.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the surface of the
bare graphite rod shows typical graphite structure, in which the sheets
are large and densely packed. Then, these bare graphite rods are heated
at 1050 °C for 5 min. The SEM image of graphite rod post heating
results in the creation of numerous defects on the surface of the
graphite rods (we call it as defect-induced graphite rod). During
electrochemical exfoliation process, cutting and oxidation occur at
defect sites. So, generating more number of defects will provide more
sites for cutting and oxidation and facilitate the process. The defect-induced
graphite rods are used as anode and cathode and then dipped in the
electrolyte solution. Electrolyte used is a mixture of citric acid
and NaOH in water. This results in sodium citrate salt and water in
the solution. On applying potential, hydrolysis of water occurs, giving
H+ and OH– ions. Due to the influence
of the electric field, there is intercalation of anions (OH– ions) in between the graphite layers of the defect-induced graphite
rod. The OH– ions get oxidized on the defect sites.
The produced oxygen creates pressure in between the graphite layers.
The OH– ions and oxygen occupy the van der Waals
gaps and results in exfoliation of the defect-induced graphite rod
(anode). Due to C–C cleavage by the electric field, either
GQDs or GOQDs are obtained based on the predefined molar ratio of
citric acid and NaOH.30−37 Schematic illustration (Figure 1) depicts the surface of graphite rod before and after
heating, the formation of OH– ions, intercalation
of OH– ions, production of oxygen, and the obtained
GQDs. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of inside core
of graphite rod (Figure 1) shows a typical graphite structure, in which the separation between
layers is 0.35 nm. Other TEM image shows the surface of graphite rod
after electrochemical exfoliation process, in which the sites are
shown from where the GQDs were cut and peeled off. These sites show
that the separation between layers is 0.23 nm, which is the lattice
constant of GQDs or graphene. The final TEM image (Figure 1) shows the distribution of
obtained GQDs prepared by electrochemical exfoliation process.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of electrochemical exfoliation of defect-induced
graphite rod. Intercalation of OH– ions, O2 production, and exfoliation process result in the production of
graphene quantum dots.

2.3 Role of Anion Concentration in the Electrolyte
for GQDs and GOQDs Formation
The anion distribution is given
in Table 1. GQD1: The
obtained 1.5 M OH– ions and 0.5 M citrate ions move
toward the anode and oxidize. As the hydroxyl ion concentration is
half (1.5 M OH– ions), in comparison to that of
GQD3 (3 M OH– ions; balanced reaction), this should
result in decrease in oxidation. However, from the characterization
results, it is apparent that a large amount of oxidation occurs. This
is due to the participation of citrate ions in the oxidation and peeling
off process. Here, GOQDs are obtained instead of GQDs. GQD2: The obtained
2 M OH– ions and 0.3 M citrate ions move toward
the anode and oxidize. As the hydroxyl ion concentration is 2/3 (2
M OH– ions) in comparison to that of GQD3 (3 M OH– ions), this should result in decrease in oxidation.
However, characterization results suggest that the occurrence of oxidation
is less than that for GQD1 but more in comparison to that of GQD3
(balanced reaction). This is because of the decrease in citrate ions.
Here, GOQDs are obtained with a lesser amount of oxygen functional
groups in comparison to that of GQD1. GQD3: The obtained 3 M OH– ions move toward the anode and oxidize. As a result,
the 3 M OH– ions start peeling off the graphite
layers from the defect sites. Here, GQDs are obtained. GQD4: As the
OH– ion concentration is higher (4 M OH– ions), in comparison to that of GQD3 (3 M OH– ions),
there is an increase in oxidation, which is confirmed by the characterization
results. This is because of the increase in hydroxyl ions. Here, GOQDs
are obtained instead of GQDs.

3.2 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
Figure 4 illustrates
XPS survey peaks and high-resolution C1s spectra for GQD1–GQD4. Table 2 depicts the XPS survey
peaks and C%, O%, and C1s deconvoluted peaks. XPS is used
to analyze the composition of prepared GQDs. The XPS survey scans
of GQD1–GQD4 depict two peaks, for C1s at ca. 284.4
eV and O1s at ca. 531.2 eV. For GQD1–GQD4, atomic
percentage of C1s is in the range of 39.6–54.4%
and atomic percentage of O1s is in the range of 45.6–60.4%.
The narrow scan of C1s band for GQD1 and GQD3 can be fitted
to four deconvoluted characteristic peaks, whereas GQD2 and GQD4 can
be fitted to five deconvoluted characteristic peaks. The deconvoluted
characteristic peaks correspond to the binding energies of C–C,
C=C, C–H, C–O, C=O, and O–C=O
bonds. The binding energy
observed for C–C is 283.85 eV, C=C is 284.4 eV, C–H
is 285.2 ± 0.1 eV, C–O is 286.8 ± 0.2 eV, C=O
is 287.8 ± 0.1 eV, and O–C=O is 288.57 eV.39

GQD4	42.9	57.1	17.7	48.3	 	18.4	5.1	2.5	
From GQD1 to GQD3, O% decreased
from 60.4 to 45.6%. This implies that the oxidation has decreased.
This is due to decrease in citrate ions from GQD1 (0.5 M) to GQD3
(0 M). However, from GQD3 to GQD4, O% increased from 45.6 to 57.1%.
This is due to the increase in OH– ions from GQD3
(0.3 M) to GQD4 (0.4 M). This results in increase in oxidation. The
amount of C–O functional group in GQD1 is maximum (36.9%) and
in GQD3 is minimum (12.6%). The amount of C–O functional group
in GQD2 (19.4%) is comparable to that in GQD4 (18.4%). The amount
of C=O functional group in GQD1 is maximum (14.5%) and that
in GQD4 is minimum (5.1%). The O–C=O (2.5%) functional
group is observed only in GQD4.40 GQD1
and GQD4 were observed to be having maximum amount of oxygen functional
groups.41−43 The amount of oxygen functional groups is more in
GQD1, GQD2, and GQD4 in comparison to GQD3. This shows that during
electrochemical exfoliation reaction, oxygen-rich functional groups
are introduced onto the surface of GQDs. The presence of the oxygen-rich
functional groups in GQDs results in green luminescence under 365
nm UV irradiation (Figure 2) and broadening of D band in Raman spectra (Figure 6).

3.3 X-ray
Diffraction
Figure 5 illustrates X-ray diffraction
patterns of GQD1–GQD4. As depicted in Figure 5, GQD1–GQD4 exhibit a broad diffraction
peak at ca. 23° corresponding to the (002) plane.44 It is to be noted that GQD1, GQD2, and GQD4
also show another diffraction peak at ca. 9°. This implies the
presence of oxygen-rich functional groups present on the surface of
GQD1, GQD2, and GQD4. However, this peak is negligible for GQD3, which
indicates that the presence of oxygen functional groups is minimal.45

3.4 Raman
Spectroscopy
Figure 6 illustrates Raman spectra
of GQD1–GQD4. Table S2 depicts the
values obtained by Raman
characterization. Two characteristic peaks were observed, which correspond
to D and G bands. For GQD1–GQD4, the D band is observed at
ca. 1350 cm–1 and G band at ca. 1590 cm–1 with ID/IG greater than 1.

Figure 6 Raman spectra of GQD1–GQD4 (a–d) measured
with 514
nm argon laser at 10 mW power. D band and G band are observed at ca.
1350 and 1590 cm–1, respectively.

The values of D band, G band, and ID/IG are shown in Table S2. D band is a disorder-induced band,
which confirms
the presence of disorder on the edges in the form of sp3 carbons, surface states, or functional groups on the surface of
GQDs. The D band observed here is in the range of 1338–1350
cm–1. It arises due to bonding and antibonding orbitals,
i.e., intervalley backscattering with breathing mode of A1g phonon at K-point. The broadening of the D peak
is due to an increase in sp3 hybridized content of carbon
to carbon bonds, carbon to oxygen bonds, epoxy and hydroxyl groups,
and so forth.46 The G band arises due to
the stretching C–C bonds present in the sp2 carbon
network. The G band observed here is in the range of 1585–1598
cm–1. This is due to E2g phonon vibrations
at Γ-point, which arises due to strains produced in the sp2 carbon network. Intensity ratio of D band to G band, i.e., ID/IG, is the measure
of degree of disorder.47 The ID/IG observed is greater than
1. This indicates that several defects are present at the surface
of GQDs.

3.5 UV–Vis and Photoluminescence Excitation
(PLE) Spectra
Figure 7 illustrates UV–vis spectra and PLE spectra for GQD1–GQD4
(a–d). The inset images depict GQD1–GQD4 in daylight
and under 365 nm UV irradiation. Table 3 depicts the values for different transitions and the
band gap obtained. GQD1–GQD4 dispersions emit light yellow
fluorescence in daylight. When exposed to 365 nm UV irradiation, GQD1–GQD4
emit light green, light blue-green, blue, and blue-green regions,
respectively.

(red
line) for GQD1–GQD4 (a–d). The inset images are daylight
images and under 365 nm UV irradiation images.

excitation peaks (nm)	349	340	363	328	
band gap (eV)	3.55	3.64	3.41	3.78	
A prominent absorption
peak is observed between 253 and 279 nm,
which corresponds to π → π* transition of sp2 C–C bonds. The shoulder peak at around 325–370
nm ascribes to n → π* transition of C=O bonds
or other functional groups present on the surface of GQD1–GQD4.6 Two prominent peaks are observed in the PLE spectra
between 343 and 403 nm, which correspond to armchair edges and oxygen-rich
functional groups present on the surface of GQD1–GQD4.48 These surface defects or oxygen-rich functional
groups on GQD1–GQD4 emit blue to green fluorescence when exposed
to 365 nm UV irradiation.

3.6 Excitation-Dependent Photoluminescence
Behavior
Figure 8 illustrates
excitation-dependent PL behavior of GQD1–GQD4, respectively. Table S3 depicts the values obtained by PL characterization.
From UV–vis spectra and PLE spectra, it is identified that
the excitation wavelength is in the range of 343–403 nm. The
excitation wavelength has been varied between 350 and 510 nm with
an increment of 20 nm. A variation of the excitation wavelength causes
a change in emission wavelength. The peak intensity of emission reduces
with an increase of the excitation wavelength.

Figure 8 Excitation-dependent
PL behavior of GQD1–GQD4 (a–d).
The insets show excitation wavelengths and their corresponding emission
wavelengths.

PL in GQDs arises due
to quantum confinement effect and surface
states.6 Quantum confinement effect is
due to carbon core. Surface states are due to the presence of functional
groups present on the surface of GQD1–GQD4. XPS images (discussed
in Figure 4) suggest
the presence of C–H, C–O, C=O, and O–C=O
functional groups on the surface of GQD1–GQD4. These groups
significantly contribute to the luminescence of GQD1–GQD4.
Variation in excitation wavelength causes a change in emission wavelength.
This could be due to differently sized GQDs (Figure 3) and surface states (Figure 4).6 PL spectrum
for GQD1 exhibits two peaks at 460 and 522 nm. The peak at 460 nm
could possibly arise due to armchair edges and peak at 522 nm due
to C–O and C=O functional groups. For GQD2, the peak
at 522 nm is significantly reduced, which could be due to decrease
in the amount of C–O and C=O functional groups. For
GQD3, the amount of oxidation is minimum; the blue luminescence could
be due to armchair edges in GQD3.6 For
GQD4, oxidation is again increased and the green emission is due to
the presence of C=O and O–C=O functional groups.
For GQD1 and GQD4, green luminescence originates due to the presence
of oxygen functional groups C–O, C=O, and O–C=O
on the surface of GQD1 and GQD4.48 The
synthesis procedure plays a significant role in obtaining the functional
groups on the surface of GQDs.6

3.7 Time-Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Figure 9 illustrates
fluorescence decay curve (along with curve fitting) of GQD1–GQD4. Table 4 depicts the values
obtained by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) characterization.
Fluorescence decay curves of GQD1–GQD4 are measured using time-correlated
single photon counting spectrometer. The fluorescence decay curve
is fitted with triexponential function (eq 1), which indicates that fluorescence decay
occurs through three relaxation pathways. The red line shows decay
curve, and the blue line shows fitted curve. The fitting is performed
using the following equation 1  where “τ” is the fluorescence
lifetime and “B” represents amplitude
of the corresponding lifetime. The obtained χ2 ranges
between 1.08 and 1.16. The χ2 value in the range
of 1.0 < χ2 < 1.2 was assumed to provide a
good fit. Among the three lifetimes, one is due to intrinsic state
and the other two are due to the presence of oxygen-rich functional
groups on the surface of GQDs. Fluorescence lifetimes of GQDs are
recorded at 450 nm for GQD1, GQD2, and GQD3 and at 480 nm for GQD4.
The excitation wavelength is 375 nm, which is provided by a diode
laser. The fluorescence emission of the surface states exhibit a longer
lifetime in comparison to that of the intrinsic state emission. For
GQD1–GQD4, exciton lifetimes are ca. 2 ns (ca. 50%), ca. 6
ns (ca. 10%), and ca. 0.5 ns (ca. 40%).

Figure 9 Fluorescence decay curves
for GQD1–GQD4 (a–d) at
450 and 480 nm measured by TCSPC, excited at 375 nm. The red line
shows decay curve, and the blue line shows fitted curve.

for GQD1–GQD4
 	GQD1	GQD2	GQD3	GQD4	
Ex/Emi (nm)	375/450	375/450	375/450	375/480	
χ2	1.16	1.15	1.08	1.12	
τ1 (ns)/B1 (%)	1.9/50	2.1/52	1.9/52	1.9/44	
τ2 (ns)/B2 (%)	6.21/9	7.2/8	5.7/10	6.3/11	
τ3 (ns)/B3 (%)	0.51/39	0.63/39	0.49/37	0.42/44	
From Table 4, for
GQD1–GQD4, three lifetimes are observed as ca. 0.5, 2, and
6 ns. The PLE spectra (Figure 7) depict two peaks representing the two functional groups
(armchair edges and oxygen functional groups). Two peaks in PLE curve
correspond to TCSPC results (Figure 9), in which the two functional groups have high fluorescence
decay time (ca. 2 and 6 ns) in comparison to that of intrinsic state
lifetime (ca. 0.5 ns). It is understood that the luminescences of
GQD1–GQD4 are primarily dominated by the functional groups
present on the surface of GQD1–GQD4. The fluorescence lifetime
in nanosecond range indicates that GQD1–GQD4 have singlet-state
nature.49,50

3.8 Energy Band Diagram
Figure 10 illustrates
energy band diagrams
of GQD1–GQD4. The energy levels are proposed with the help
of TEM (Figure 3),
UV–vis and PLE (Figure 7), PL (Figure 8), and TCSPC (Figure 9) characterization results. The average size of GQD1–GQD4
plays a crucial role in intrinsic state absorption. As depicted in
the UV–vis curve discussed in Figure 7, for GQD1–GQD4, π–π*
transition is observed in the range of 253–279 nm with average
size of ca. 2.5 nm (Figure 3). As we can see, in the intrinsic state in Figure 10, due to increase in size
of GQD1 (2.5 nm) to GQD2 (3.04 nm), there is an occurrence of red
shift. For GQD2 (3.04 nm) to GQD3 (2.24 nm), there is a decrease in
size, resulting in blue shift. However, due to slight increase in
size from GQD3 (2.24 nm) to GQD4 (2.65 nm), red shift is seen. As
depicted in the PLE curve shown in Figure 7, for n−π* transition, GQD1
shows two peaks at 354 and 370 nm, GQD2 shows two peaks at 343 and
368 nm, GQD3 shows two peaks at 359 and 376 nm, and GQD4 shows two
peaks at 361 and 403 nm. These two peaks correspond to two surface
states present on the surface of GQD1–GQD4. The energy levels
corresponding to these two surface states are shown in Figure 10. The excitation-dependent
PL (Figure 8) shows
maximum emission in the range of 448–538 nm. PL emission shows two peaks at 454 and 535 nm for GQD1, 448 and 527
nm for GQD2, 448 nm for GQD3, and 480 and 538 nm for GQD4. The blue
luminescence at ca. 450 nm and green luminescence at ca. 530 nm arise
due to the two surface states. Figure 2 shows luminescence under 365 nm UV irradiation. GQD1,
GQD2, and GQD4 emit blue and green luminescence, whereas GQD3 emits
only blue luminescence. Green luminescence is due to the presence
of oxygen-rich functional groups, and blue luminescence could be possibly
due to the presence of armchair edges.48,6 For GQD3, the
green luminescence is nearly absent due to very low amount of oxygen
functional groups. The energy levels corresponding to blue and green
luminescence are shown in Figure 10. The fluorescence lifetime decay curve (Figure 9) is fitted with triexponential
function. The obtained three lifetimes are 0.5, ca. 2, and ca. 6 ns.
The lowest lifetime corresponds to intrinsic state. However, the two
higher lifetimes correspond to these two surface states. These two
surface states are shown as molecule-like states reported elsewhere.51 XPS analysis (Figure 4) supports the above discussion regarding
the functional groups. However, it is very difficult to figure out
the exact surface states experimentally and is beyond the scope of
the present work.

Figure 10 Schematic representation of the proposed energy levels
of GQD1–GQD4.
The intrinsic state depends on size. The surface states determine
the optical properties.

4 Conclusions and Future Directions
In
summary, we have developed an easy electrochemical exfoliation
strategy to prepare graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and graphene oxide
quantum dots (GOQDs). By varying the alkali hydroxide concentration
in the electrolyte, we get GOQDs with tunable oxygen functional groups.
A simple electrochemical setup, i.e., with two graphite rods (electrodes),
and electrolyte as combination of citric acid and alkali hydroxide
is used. Heating the graphite rods at high temperature causes the
generation of defects on the surface of graphite rods. Further, OH– ion intercalation, oxygen production, and exfoliation
of GQDs form the basis of the mechanism of formation of GQDs. The
GQDs and GOQDs have the average size of 2–3 nm and show blue
to green fluorescence under 365 nm UV irradiation. Thus, GQDs and
GOQDs with tunable oxygen functional groups can be easily prepared
by varying the alkali hydroxide concentration in the electrolyte.
The easy preparation approach and their unique luminescence properties
make them potential candidate for biological applications, such as
bioimaging, photodynamic therapy, biosensing, and many others.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Preparation of GQDs
Graphite rods
(purity > 99.9995%) are purchased from Alfa Aesar (CAS No. 7782-42-5).
The graphite rods with a diameter of 3.05 mm and an approximate length
of 60 mm are heated in a furnace (at 1050 °C for 5 min) in the
presence of air. After 5 min, the graphite rods are allowed to cool
at room temperature. Thereafter, the graphite rods are washed with
Milli-Q water to remove large particles from the surface of the graphite
rods. The graphite rods are then used as anode and cathode, i.e.,
electrodes to be dipped in the electrolyte. Four types of GQDs are
prepared i.e., GQD1–GQD4. For GQD1–GQD4, the electrolyte
used is a mixture of citric acid monohydrate (0.1 M) and NaOH (0.15–0.4
M) in Milli-Q water (50 mL). Thereafter, the electrochemical experiments
are done with CHI660D Electrochemical Workstation. The separation
between the graphite rods is ca. 25 mm. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is
performed prior to performing chronoamperometry. CV is performed with
a voltage range of −1 to +1 V, to wet the graphite electrodes.
Thereafter, chronoamperometry is performed with a voltage of +10 V
and a sensitivity (I/V) of 0.1 for
30 min. As a result, the color of the electrolyte solution changes
from colorless to yellow, which confirms the exfoliation of graphite
rod. After completion of this reaction, calcium chloride (0.15 M)
is added to the prepared solution. This solution is slightly heated
to precipitate calcium citrate. Centrifugation is performed for 15
min at 10 000 rpm twice to separate the calcium citrate precipitate.
The supernatant is thereafter filtered through membrane filtration
(Himedia, Dialysis Membrane-150, LA401, pore size ca. 2.4 nm) for
7 days to remove salt from the solution.

5.2 Instruments
and Characterization
UV–vis absorption spectra were
recorded on a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (Jasco V-650 spectrophotometer, Jasco Int. Pvt.
Ltd.). Photoluminescence (PL) studies were performed on a Cary Eclipse
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). X-ray diffraction
patterns were measured on PANalytical X’Pert PRO Model Empyrean
X-ray diffractometer (45 kV, 40 mA, Cu Kα radiation). SEM characterization
was done using field emission gun-SEM instrument (JEOL JSM-7600F).
High-resolution TEM was used to determine particle size, distribution,
and morphologies of GQDs using TEM (200 kV, JEOL JEM-2100F). X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using
a scanning XPS microscope (PHI 5000 VersaProbe-II, ULVAC-PHI; Al Kα
monochromatic radiation energy, 1486.7 eV). Raman characterization
was done with a Raman microscope (LabRAM HR 800 micro-Raman microscope,
514 nm argon laser used with a power of 10 mW). A time-correlated
single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer (IBH Horiba Jobin Yvon,
FluoroCube) was used to measure nanosecond lifetime. GQDs were excited
with a 375 nm diode laser (Horiba NanoLED), and the decay curves were
fitted using IBH DAS 6.2 software.
