Computational screening
is a method to prioritize small-molecule
compounds based on the structural and biochemical attributes built
from ligand and target information. Previously, we have developed
a scalable virtual screening workflow to identify novel multitarget
kinase/bromodomain inhibitors. In the current study, we identified
several novel N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
derivatives that scored highly in our ensemble docking protocol. We
quantified the binding affinity of these compounds for BRD4(BD1) biochemically
and generated cocrystal structures, which were deposited in the Protein
Data Bank. As the docking poses obtained in the virtual screening
pipeline did not align with the experimental cocrystal structures,
we evaluated the predictions of their precise binding modes by performing
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulations closely reproduced
the experimentally observed protein–ligand cocrystal binding
conformations and interactions for all compounds. These results suggest
a computational workflow to generate experimental-quality protein–ligand
binding models, overcoming limitations of docking results due to receptor
flexibility and incomplete sampling, as a useful starting point for
the structure-based lead optimization of novel BRD4(BD1) inhibitors.

Introduction
Epigenetics refers
to changes in gene expression that are not due
to DNA sequence modifications.1 Epigenetic
modifications occur due to the coordinated activities of three classes
of epigenetic proteins, namely, writers, readers, and erasers.2 Epigenetic readers recognize specific modifications,
such as histone acetylation and nucleotide methylation, which promote
nucleosome remodeling. Importantly, regulatory posttranslational modifications
of proteins such as lysine acetylation have emerged as essential marks
for regulating transcription, metabolism, and cell signaling.3 Bromodomain proteins are a family of epigenetic
reader domain proteins that bind acetylated lysine residues, particularly
in the N-terminal tails of histones, facilitating decondensation of
chromatin and regulation of gene expression. Of the 61 bromodomain
modules found in 42 diverse proteins of the human proteome, bromodomain
and extra-terminal (BET) proteins include family members BRD2, BRD3,
BRD4, and BRDT.4 These proteins contain
two bromodomains termed bromodomain 1 (BD1) and bromodomain 2 (BD2)
and exhibit a high level of sequence conservation in the amino terminal;
however, more divergence has been characterized in the carboxy terminal
of this protein family.5 Bromodomain-containing
protein 4 (BRD4) has been linked to the expression of oncogenes such
as MYC and is a promising target for cancer therapy.6 Specifically, researchers observe BRD4 overexpression in
various cancers, including glioblastoma and squamous cell carcinoma,
among others.7 Recently, the discovery
and development of BET protein inhibitors allow for the treatment
of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, with many studies demonstrating
promising results.

Additionally, the structural topology of
BRD4 consists of four
α helices (αz, αA, αB, and αC) linked by ZA and BC loops that
have been shown to be responsible for substrate specificity.8 Previous structure determination of BRD4 with
acetylated histone peptides demonstrates acetyl-lysine binding in
the central hydrophobic cavity, where a hydrogen bond forms with N140.
This conserved binding motif was also observed in previously characterized
BRD4 inhibitors.8

Recent advances
in computational methods and power facilitate high-throughput
approximation of binding free energies and dynamics with increasing
accuracy.9 The classical “lock-and-key”
theory of protein–ligand binding, in which a rigid receptor
is thought to accommodate a small molecule, has given way to dynamic
molecular models that aim to incorporate induced changes of small-molecule
ligand and receptor conformation upon binding. Accordingly, such models
can lead to better results and more accurate predictions.10,11 Structure-based virtual screening methods, such as docking, typically
search for energetically favorable conformations and atomic interactions
of a small-molecule binding to a protein pocket and often use empirical
scoring functions to estimate binding free energy to various degrees
of accuracy but minimally to enrich actives out of a pool of mostly
inactive compounds. In contrast to ligand-based models, which do not
use a protein structure and rely on correlations between chemical
topology and binding affinity, structure-based models can predict
the atomic interactions through which a new small molecule binds to
a protein of interest and can estimate how energetically favorable
that interaction is. If correct, these models are useful for the development
and optimization of lead compounds. Although structure-based methods
can be highly predictive, for flexible proteins it can be challenging
to find the best “induced-fit” binding pose and accurately
predict (or rank order) their binding affinity. Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation can help solve that problem, and advances in computer
hardware and user-friendly software have enabled much higher throughput
simulation of multicomponent dynamic molecular systems, including
those with protein and ligand components.12−14 Several examples
have demonstrated that MD can improve structure-based virtual screening
by predicting stable low-energy ligand–receptor binding conformations.15−19 Although computationally intensive, this approach has the potential
to produce an accurate binding model even if no cocrystal structure
is available, which is often a limiting factor with many druggable
targets.20 Furthermore, alchemical free
energy calculations have recently been shown to provide robust and
accurate protein–ligand binding energies. However, these are
among the most computationally intensive methods and require extensive
sampling to converge accurately.21−24 In this study, we were primarily
interested in accurate pose prediction and activity ranking and therefore
did not computationally investigate more expensive free-energy methods.

Here, we report the identification of six novel N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide derivatives that
scored high in an ensemble docking virtual screening workflow. We
determined their BRD4(BD1) binding affinity biochemically and resolved
the cocrystal structures for these compounds, which were deposited
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).25 Because
the docking poses obtained in the virtual screening pipeline did not
align with the later determined experimental cocrystal structures,
we ran MD simulations on the original docking poses and were able
to closely reproduce the experimental cocrystal structure binding
poses for all compounds. These results suggest that binding conformation
and atomic protein–ligand interactions of a novel class of
BRD4 inhibitors can be accurately predicted using published cocrystal
structures and MD simulations. Docking studies based on the MD-optimized
binding models suggest improved performance in terms of enriching
known actives and to rank order activity of a novel chemotype, which
we extensively characterized. Our results provide a useful starting
point for the structure-based lead optimization of BRD4(BD1) inhibitors.

Results
We had previously reported a scalable virtual screening workflow
using kinase machine learning classifiers and parallel ensemble docking
to identify a novel dual kinase BET inhibitor.26 Briefly, we first prioritized 908 compounds using kinase
machine learning models and then docked these compounds into several
structures of BRD4(BD1) obtained from the PDB that were selected and
processed to represent diverse cocrystal ligands as well as to include
and exclude conserved cocrystal water. Here, we report the biochemical
AlphaScreen, an AlphaScreen counter assay, and differential scanning
fluorimetry (DSF) to confirm the activity of six BRD4 inhibitors identified
via the virtual screening pipeline (see Experimental
Section). Several of these compounds had IC50 values
in the range of 11–44 μM as determined via a BRD4(BD1)-acetylated
histone interaction assay (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).
All six compounds are N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamides,
a previously unreported druglike scaffold for BRD4. As they were novel
compounds, we produced cocrystals and resolved their structures (Figure 1). Analysis of the
cocrystal structures displayed some interactions that were predicted
by our ensemble docking model (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). The cocrystal structures are also very useful to
interpret the structure–activity relationships (SARs) observed
for that series (see Discussion and Conclusions). However, when comparing the best docking poses with the experimentally
determined structures, we observed differences in ligand binding conformation
with ligand root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 1.57 to
2.35 Å (Supplementary Table 2). We
were interested in improving the computational pose predictions, and
specifically, whether MD simulations would converge to the experimental
cocrystal binding pose. Our motivation was to reliably predict the
correct binding pose of a new chemotype of BRD4(BD1) in the absence
of a cocrystal structure, which is much more time-consuming and expensive
to obtain than running MD simulations.

BRD4 binders. Conserved interactions are observed between all compounds
and the BRD4 N140 acetyl-lysine binding motif. Interactions with P82,
V87, P82, D145, I146, and M149 are also observed across binding interactions
with this scaffold.

A 50 ns all-atom explicit water
MD simulation was performed for
all active N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
derivatives starting from the docking results. Each MD system was
created from the docked protein–ligand complex that corresponded
to the best docking score (i.e., the BRD4(BD1) PDB structure that
resulted in the highest absolute docking score with its corresponding
docked ligand). Simulation trajectory analysis showed ligand binding
pose stabilization after 20 to 30 ns as quantified by ligand RMSD
from starting coordinates. Over that time frame, ligand RMSD relative
to the starting (docked) conformation changed by approximately 2 Å
and was then stable (Supplementary Table 2). Interactions throughout the trajectories showed conserved interactions
with N140, which is a well-described residue necessary for BRD4 inhibitor
binding (Figure 2).8 To assess whether the ligand conformation approaches
the experimental binding pose, we transformed the default trajectory
ligand RMSD relative to frame zero (the starting docked pose) into
a representation relative to the cocrystal ligand pose using E1. The definition of RMSD is found in E2. The transformed trajectories are depicted in Figure 3 and illustrate how
the docking poses, which are quite different from the experimental
cocrystal structure, converge to RMSD within 0.08–0.46 Å,
corresponding to the experimentally determined reference pose.

molecular simulation. Primary receptor ligand interactions (hydrogen
bonds, hydrophobic, ionic, water bridges) of 8302 for the duration
of the MD simulation with BRD4(1). The top panel shows the total number
of specific contacts the protein makes with the ligand over the course
of the trajectory. The bottom panel shows which residues interact
with the ligand over the simulation time. Some residues make more
than one specific contact with the ligand, which is represented by
a darker shade of orange, according to the scale to the right of the
plot. The visualizations were generated using the Desmond simulation
interactions diagram component.

Figure 3 N-[3-(2-Oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
ligand RMSD relative to the cocrystal pose over the duration of the
MD simulation. Each panel illustrates how the ligand pose RMSD (Å)
converged during the MD simulation from the original docking pose
(obtained using a published cocrystal structure of a different chemotype)
toward the experimentally determined cocrystal structure.

For further illustration, we extracted the final
frame from each
simulation and overlaid it onto the experimental cocrystal structure. Figure 4 shows that these
poses are essentially identical. For the most active compound (8302),
we calculated the heavy-atom RMSD of the protein binding site (5 Å
around the ligand) before and after the simulations and observed a
1.84 Å change in the binding site geometry during the simulation.

Figure 4 Overlay
of ligand poses obtained by docking after MD optimization
and experimental cocrystal structure. Bound ligand after MD shown
in orange, and cocrystal ligand shown in teal. Ligand RMSD < 0.5
Å in all cases. Ligand poses after MD corresponded much more
closely to the experimentally determined conformations compared to
the initial docking poses.

To demonstrate that the protein structure and the protein–ligand
pose remain stable after the 50 ns MD simulation and that the simulation
time of 50 ns is appropriate, we ran a 500 ns simulation of the best
compound (8302) in BRD4(BD1) starting with the same docking pose as
the initial simulations. Supplementary Figure 10 shows the protein and ligand heavy-atom RMSD of the 8302–BRD4(BD1)
complex over the duration of 500 ns and clearly illustrates that both
the protein and the ligand RMSD remain stable. The protein RMSD levels
out at between 3 and 3.5 Å, which suggests that the binding site
adjustment throughout the simulation (RMSD 1.8 Å) is significant.

Our results demonstrate that via MD simulations (starting from
the best docking poses) we can reliably reproduce the experimentally
observed cocrystal protein–ligand complexes much more accurately
than docking alone (Supplementary Table 2). Although not unexpected, this is an important and encouraging
result from the perspective of virtual screening, rational drug design,
and lead optimization.

We next determined whether the protein–ligand
complexes
optimized by MD (but not using our experimental cocrystal structures)
would improve the ability to identify and rank order active compounds
compared to the original models based on the previously published
PDB cocrystal structures. We asked whether optimizing ligand docking
poses using MD could improve computational predictions without the
need to obtain cocrystal structures. Although all-atom explicit solvent
MD simulations can be computationally expensive, methods such as minimization
with implicit solvent neglect important water contributions to BRD4(BD1)
binding and do not sample the protein–ligand interface sufficiently
to escape static local minima and reliably predict the correct pose.
To test this, we extracted three frames from the MD trajectory (after
stabilization of the ligand RMSD) of the three most active ligands
(8302, 8110, and 8200) and prepared docking models. Known active and
decoy compounds were redocked using the three models, and docking
scores were aggregated as before (see Methods). Using the MD-optimized
model, docking predictions for the experimentally determined active
compounds better reflected their BRD4 activity; the most active compounds
received better docking scores. The receiver operating characteristic
area under the curve (ROC) score using previously known BRD4 actives
was slightly improved, suggesting that the MD-optimized docking models
do not result in decreased predictive performance for other BRD4 scaffolds
but tend to globally improve predictive performance (Supplementary Figure 4).

Using the optimized models,
we then redocked the 908 compounds
from which our lead compounds had originally been identified. All N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide derivatives
scored consistently better compared to the original models, and they
better correlated quantitatively to their experimentally determined
BRD4 activity (Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 5). In addition
to correlating experimental pIC50 values with docking scores
(Supplementary Figure 5a), we also computed
molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding
free energies and observed the same trend in which the computed estimated
binding free energy tracked the experimental activity much better
postoptimization, compared to preoptimization (Supplementary Figure 5b).

Figure 5 Ensemble docking score distribution of
the initial and the MD-optimized
docking models. The plot shows the distribution of active compounds
(peach) and inactive compounds (teal). The vertical (y) axis and histogram on the right correspond to the distribution
of the original docking scores (before MD optimization). The horizontal
(x) axis and histogram on the top of the plot correspond
to the docking scores after MD optimization. The MD-optimized docking
scores show much better separation between active and inactive compounds.

To demonstrate that the MD-optimized
docking model improves the
enrichment of commercially available compounds determined to be active
against BRD4, a log–enrichment curve was calculated. The MD-optimized
docking model better ranked active compounds compared to the initial
docking model before MD (Supplementary Figure 6). Enrichment factors (EFs) for the top 1% best scoring compounds
were 51 and 38 for the MD-optimized and initial docking models, respectively
(Supplementary Table 3). The 908 compounds
from which the N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
derivatives were identified included four additional sulfonamide compounds
that were not prioritized in our original docking study and therefore
not ordered or tested. Although the optimized docking scores of these
compounds also improved (scores initially ranging from −6.56
to −6.83 and improving to the range −7.09 to −7.54),
their optimized score would not have placed them among the top compounds
for experimental testing, suggesting that our method does not indiscriminately
result in better docking scores for the chemotype it was optimized
with but better separates actives from inactives. In addition to better
separating the active sulfonamide compounds from the remaining compounds
and thus more confidently predicting their activity, the optimized
model generally better separated active compounds from their presumed
inactive decoys. Compounds that were purchased, but found to be inactive,
scored more poorly (Figure 5). Together, these results suggest that the predictive performance
of a docking model can be improved upon structural optimization using
MD simulations. As expected, this improvement is particularly effective
for compounds of the same scaffold as the optimized bound ligand,
but an overall improvement of enrichment and predictive performance
for known active BRD4 compounds is also evident. Most importantly
however, we were able to reproduce the experimental binding pose via
MD starting from a docking pose of a receptor of a different cocrystal
ligand. This approach therefore appears useful for structure-guided
lead optimization without the need for a cocrystal structure.

To investigate the novelty of the sulfonamide compound series,
Tanimoto similarities against all known BRD4 compounds using ECFP4
chemical fingerprints were computed (Supplementary Figure 7a). Nine of the most similar (0.3–0.4) reported
BRD4 inhibitors are shown in Supplementary Figure 7b. Although this cutoff would not be significant enough to
consider them likely active based on the similarity alone, we further
investigated the compounds, which included PFI-1 (compound 4 in Supporting Figure 7) and derivatives
as well as phenyl isoxazole sulfonamide compounds (compounds 1–3 in Supporting Figure 7) from GSK.27,28 These compounds are structurally
distinct from our N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamides,
particularly the 2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl moiety that forms the characteristic
hydrogen bonding interaction with BRD4 N140. We also computed the
3D shape similarity of our novel sulfonamide BRD4 binders to all known
inhibitors using the ROCS package from OpenEye29 (see Methods). There was no single shape or color ROCS
similarity score greater than 0.5 and the Tanimoto Combo score, which
includes both shape and color scoring, varied between 0.2 and 0.7
for all of the known BRD4 compounds (Supplementary Figure 8a). Tanimoto Combo is a combination of both shape Tanimoto
and color Tanimoto scoring functions (the score ranges from 0 to 2),
and many perceive it as the best global 3D similarity scoring metric
in the ROCS package.29Supplementary Figure 8b shows the top six most shape-similar
compounds, including phenyl isoxazole sulfonamide compounds also enriched
in the ECFP4 similarity study, and isoxazole azepine compounds, which
share similar binding interactions in their amino-isoxazole moiety.28,30

To investigate perceived pharmacophoric similarity of the
well-characterized
PFI-1 to our compounds, we aligned the cocrystal structure of the
most active compound in our series, 8302, with PFI-1. Supplementary Figure 9 illustrates similarity
in binding orientation; we determined RMSD to be 1.1 Å. The sulfonamide
and the aromatic substituents are well-aligned, and both compounds
exhibit the key hydrogen bond interaction with N140 via their 2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl
(8302) and tetrahydroquinazoline-2-one moieties. However, this interaction
is to be expected and is the characteristic binding motif of most
BRD4(BD1) inhibitors. Additionally, 8302 maintains hydrophobic interactions
with Y81, W83, and I146, which is distinct from PFI-1 (see Discussion).
This characterization suggested that our compounds are pharmacophorically
somewhat similar to PFI-1 but topologically and electrostatically
distinct.

Discussion and Conclusions
We discovered a new class
of BRD4 inhibitors, characterized the
compounds biochemically, produced cocrystal structures, and studied
the binding dynamics of these novel compounds as a starting point
for future optimization.

Our virtual screening protocol used
a high-throughput ensemble
docking protocol employing various BRD4 protein structures that were
prepared to incorporate or exclude conserved cocrystal water. The
rationale of our approach was to sample a number of representative
and feasible receptor conformations and binding modes (e.g., with
or without water bridges). However, despite using an ensemble method,
significant deviations of predicted versus experimental cocrystal
ligand binding conformations were observed on the order of ∼2
Å heavy-atom RMSD per ligand. Receptor flexibility and specifically
induced receptor conformational changes upon small-molecule binding
as well as water molecules participating in binding are highly complex
processes and challenging to predict accurately, in particular via
high-throughput virtual screening such as docking, including ensemble
docking with data fusion. Novel chemotypes with no ligand-similar
experimental cocrystal structures are therefore especially difficult
to model. We identified several novel active compounds, and we extensively
characterized these inhibitors biochemically and determined the cocrystal
structure of all six compounds. With that information, we explored
the binding dynamics of these ligands in the BRD4(BD1) structure with
the goal to predict the correct, experimentally determined, cocrystal
binding pose starting from previously published cocrystal structures,
such that it would not be required to obtain a cocrystal structure
for the new chemotype. Secondarily, we were interested to improve
the relative binding affinity predictions and enrichment of active
compounds. The consideration of binding dynamics is particularly relevant
for flexible protein domains and for targets where water frequently
participates in binding such as with BET proteins.

Addressing
these issues, we demonstrated that we can generate accurate
binding models of N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
derivatives in BRD4 using molecular docking followed by 50 ns all-atom
explicit water MD simulations. The obtained binding poses were essentially
equivalent to experimental cocrystal structures. With the availability
of advanced force fields and algorithms implemented in user-friendly
software and increased computational power, relatively short (50 ns)
MD simulations can now be employed routinely. The time frame of 50
ns appears sufficient to generate a stable ligand receptor conformation
almost exactly reproducing the experimentally determined binding pose,
if the starting docking conformation can assist in separating active
from inactive compounds. This was further supported by a simulation
with a 10-fold increased simulation time (500 ns) of the most active
compound in which the protein and ligand RMSD remain stable (Supplementary Figure 10). We showed that these
optimized models can better prioritize compounds and result in improved
enrichment of known actives and in particular the sulfonamide compounds.
This improvement is likely due to the increased sampling of ligand
and protein states and convergence toward more energetically favorable
conformations, which are likely different from the initial crystal
structure conformation bound to a different chemotype. RMSD of just
the BRD4(BD1) binding site heavy atoms during the simulation illustrated
the adjustment of the binding site geometry compared to other chemotypes.
Our results are significant in that N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
represents a novel scaffold of BRD4 binders, quantified by 2D structure
and 3D shape-based similarity comparisons to previously reported actives.

The first potent inhibitors of BET proteins, (+)-JQ131 and I-BET762,32,33 were developed
based on compounds found to increase the apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA1)
activity in anti-inflammatory phenotypic screens. Both compounds are
triazolodiazepines and share a common binding mode in the acetyl-lysine
binding site of BET proteins. The structure of the BRD4-1 and (+)-JQ1
complex (PDB ID: 3MXF) shows that the triazole ring functions as an acetyl-lysine mimic
by occupying the same position as the acetyl group in histone tail
peptides. The two adjacent nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring replicate
the carbonyl group of acetyl-lysine with one hydrogen bond interaction
with the amide side chain of the conserved asparagine residue (N140
in BRD4-1) and another to the hydroxyl side chain of Y97, courtesy
of a bridging hydrogen bond through a water molecule of the structurally
conserved ZA channel. (+)-JQ1 binding is further stabilized through
extensive hydrophobic interactions: the pendant 4-chlorophenyl substituent
of the diazepine ring occupies the hydrophobic WPF (tryptophan, proline,
and phenylalanine) shelf (W81-P82-F83) present in all BET family members
and the dimethyl-substituted thieno ring packs between the same WP
motif and L92 of the ZA loop. Notably, the natural bend of the thienodiazepine
core arcs (+)-JQ1 is effectively over the WPF shelf and is critical
to attaining the near-perfect shape complementarity of this chemotype.
Like (+)-JQ1, the pyrrolidinone moiety of our N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
chemotype functions as an acetyl-lysine mimic with the oxygen atom,
establishing both a direct hydrogen bond to N140 and a ZA channel-mediated
bridging hydrogen bond to Y97. In contrast to (+)-JQ1, these compounds
form an additional bridging water-mediated hydrogen bond through the
sulfonamide nitrogen atom to the main chain carbonyl of L92. Although
our compounds also contain substituted phenyl rings which occupy a
similar position to the 4-chlorophenyl substituent of (+)-JQ1, they
lack many of the stabilizing hydrophobic interactions afforded to
(+)-JQ1 by the larger thienodiazepine-based core, such as π–π
stacking and van der Waals interactions between the dimethyl-substituted
thieno ring and P82 and L92, respectively. Given the importance of
extensive hydrophobic interactions to the positioning of small-molecule
inhibitors in the BRD4 acetyl-lysine binding site, the reduced availability
of these in our chemotype likely explains their reduced affinity compared
to (+)-JQ1 (IC50:BRD4(BD1) = 77 nM).

Following the
discovery that triazolodiazepines are potent inhibitors
of BET proteins, further research aimed to identify new chemotypes
which mimicked the acetyl-lysine moiety using fragment-based screening
approaches. Lead optimization of one such hit led to the development
of the dihydroquinazolinone PFI-1 (IC50:BRD4(BD1) = 220
nM).34 An analysis of the BRD4(BD1) and
PFI-1 complex (PMID: 4E96) reveals that the carbonyl and NH of the cyclic urea function as
a hydrogen bond donor/acceptor pair with the side chain of N140. Like
the acetyl-lysine carbonyl, the quinaolinone carbonyl of PFI-1 also
establishes a ZA channel-mediated bridging hydrogen bond to Y97. Furthermore,
PFI-1 forms an additional bridging water-mediated hydrogen bond through
the sulfonamide nitrogen atom to the backbone carbonyl of L92 in the
ZA loop. Similarly to (+)-JQ1, the 2-methoxyphenyl substituent is
directed into the hydrophobic WPF shelf. Superimposition of our cocrystal
structures with that of the BRD4-PFI-1 complex reveals a remarkably
conserved binding mechanism. The pyrrolidinone and urea carbonyls
of our N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamides
and PFI-1, respectively, overlap with one another and serve as the
principal acetyl-lysine mimicking moieties, establishing direct hydrogen
bonds to N140 and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to Y97. The central
phenyl ring of our compounds occupies the same space as the dihydroquinazolinone
phenyl of PFI-1. Noticeably, both chemotypes contain a sulfonamide
linker that introduces a sharp ∼120° turn in their planar
core structures, thereby directing the sulfonamide phenyl rings toward
the hydrophobic WPF shelf. Likewise, the sulfonamide nitrogen in both
chemotypes establishes an additional bridging water-mediated hydrogen
bond to the main chain carbonyl of L92.

Another widely explored
chemotype is the dimethylisoxazoles, as
represented by the prototypical member I-BET151/GSK1210151A (IC50:BRD4(BD1) = 790 nM).35 The BRD4-1
and I-BET-151 cocrystal structures (PDB ID: 3ZYU) demonstrate that
the isoxazole moiety serves as an acetyl-lysine mimic binding deep
within the pocket, forming a direct hydrogen bond to the side chain
of N140 and a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the side chain of Y97
through the isoxazole oxygen and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Additionally,
the quinolone nitrogen atom forms a water-mediated bridging hydrogen
bond to the main chain carbonyls of P82 and Q85 and to the amide side
chain of Q85. Like the thienodiazepine core of (+)-JQ1, the quinolone
core of I-BET151 packs between the WP motif and Leu92, and the pyridyl
group interacts with the hydrophobic WPF shelf (albeit in a different
orientation due to the stereochemistry of the preceding carbon). Comparison
of the I-BET151 and N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
binding modes shows that the carbonyl oxygens of the respective isoxazole
and pyrrolidinone moieties overlap in agreement with their acetyl-lysine
mimicking properties. However, other aspects of their binding are
different in line with their highly divergent scaffolds. Apart from
both chemotypes directing a phenyl substituent to the WPF shelf, like
the preceding discussion of the (+)-JQ1 binding mechanism, our compounds
lack many of the hydrophobic and stacking interactions formed by I-BET151,
reducing their respective affinities toward BRD4-1.

Finally,
an inspection of other common BRD4 inhibitor chemotypes,
including the quinazolones (e.g., RVX-208),36 diazobenzenes (e.g., MS436),37 and triazolopyridazines
(e.g., bromosporine),38 shows that the
prevailing commonality is the presence of an acetyl-lysine mimicking
moiety which overlays with the pyrrolidinone of our N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamides. Interestingly,
many members of these other chemotypes do not contain a pendant phenyl
substituent directed toward the hydrophobic WPF shelf in a manner
analogous to that of the 4-chlorophenyl and 2-methoxyphenyl moieties
of (+)-JQ1 and PFI-1, respectively, despite retaining modest activity
against BRD4-1, indicating that occupying the WPF shelf at this position
with an aromatic substituent is not essential for potency. However,
it is noteworthy that these compounds do have alternative aromatic
and hydrophobic substituents, which can engage in other elaborate
π–π stacking and van der Waals interactions with
residues at the entrance of the acetyl-lysine binding pocket of BRD4-1,
features which are absent from our compounds.

Taken together,
the N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
chemotype reported in this work contains a pyrrolidinone moiety as
an acetyl-lysine mimic, which establishes a direct hydrogen bond to
the conserved N140 in BRD4-1. In this regard, our chemotype provides
a novel chemical starting point to the development of structurally
diverse BET inhibitors and illustrates the large chemical diversity
accommodated by this protein pocket. However, unlike many of the most
potent BET inhibitors such as (+)-JQ1 and I-BET151, our compounds
lack many of the π–π stacking and hydrophobic interactions
necessary for further stabilization inside of the acetyl-lysine binding
site, likely explaining the reduced potency of this chemotype.

From the interaction diagrams (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2) of our six cocrystal structures of N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
ligands, it is evident that all six compounds bind with the acetyl-lysine
binding motif of bromodomain in a similar manner, presumably explaining
the relatively narrow range of the observed IC50 values
(11–44 μM) (Table 1). However, in the case of 8302, the presence of an additional
H bond acceptor (−OMe group at the ortho position of the terminal
phenyl ring, with respect to the sulfonamide functionality) appears
to provide improved binding because of better stabilization of the
water network. Adding relatively small halogen atoms, for example,
F (in cases of 8110, 8200, and 8236) and Cl (8200), to the terminal
phenyl ring does not change the binding significantly. However, adding
bulky atoms such as Br, especially at the ortho position (8152) of
the phenyl ring, seems to weaken the binding because of steric hindrance.
Future SAR and optimization to include substituents enabling interactions
observed with the most potent inhibitors (as described above) would
be predicted to significantly improve potency.

Experimental Section
BRD4 Biochemical
Activity Data
The activity data of
known BRD4 inhibitors were extracted from the ChEMBL18 database (May
7, 2014) and also curated from the recent literature.27,30,31,39−43 We utilize only compounds with reported concentration response activity
data (IC50/Kd/Ki). Chemical structures were standardized including protonation
states (neutral form, protonate acids, and deprotonate bases), tautomer
standardization, removal of salts/addends, and assigning the correct
stereochemical and geometric configuration using Pipeline Pilot 8.0
(Accelrys) (ambiguous stereochemistry or geometric configuration is
handled by LigPrep, see below); unique IDs were assigned corresponding
to unique structure representations. Activity data were p-transformed (−log10) and aggregated by unique
compound ID using the median activity p-value. We
provide aggregate and standardized activity data of compounds tested
in the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)
program (http://www.lincsproject.org/), which is available via the LINCS data portal (http://lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/).

To estimate enrichment and determine thresholds for docking
score significance, the 246 unique BRD4 inhibitors from ChEMBL were
submitted to generate decoy sets from the directory of useful decoys,
enhanced (DUD-E).44 DUD-E generated 50–100
decoy molecules per submitted ligand SMILES. The protocol for preprocessing
the 246 original ligands and the corresponding 15 250 decoy
compounds (15 496 compounds total) for docking is below.

Ensemble Docking Protocol and Data Fusion
BRD4 Docking Models
We used the Schrödinger
2014.2 software suite for structure-based manipulations and simulations
unless otherwise indicated.26 Seven BRD4
cocrystal structures were selected from the PDB from 65 available
structures (January 2014). Three crystal structures for the extensively
characterized BRD4 inhibitors, namely, JQ1 (3MXF), I-BET151 (3ZYU), and I-BET762 (3P5O), were chosen. Other
PDB crystal structures included 4HXS, 4C67, 4LR6, and 4LYW. Overall, the selection criteria included
the atomic resolution of the X-ray crystal structure, diversity in
the cocrystal ligand scaffold, and ligand interactions in the binding
site. From the seven crystal structures chosen, we identified conserved
waters found in/around the ligand binding sites to incorporate likely
ligand–protein water bridges into our models. To do this, we
aligned all BRD4 crystal structures and determined which waters fell
within 5 Å of the active site. We then kept these waters specifically
in the preparation process of two out of the seven crystal structures,
in addition to those that we had already prepared. This amounted to
nine prepared crystal structures with which to produce docking models
as described previously.

BRD4 protein structures were preprocessed
using the protein preparation workflow in Maestro 9.5 to assign bond
orders and refine the structure including hydrogen bond optimization
and constrained minimization. Where needed, missing side chains were
added using Schrödinger Prime. For each structure, one protein
chain with the cocrystal ligand was kept, and water molecules were
deleted beyond 5 Å from heteroatom groups. In addition, the internal
hydrogen bond network was optimized, followed by constrained energy
minimization.

For the resulting nine structure representations,
docking grids
were generated around the cocrystal binding sites using Schrödinger
Glide in the default settings. Redocking each cocrystal ligand into
its corresponding structure validated models; in each case, the cocrystal
pose was reproduced with RMSD values <1 Å.

Ligand Preparation
Ionization states, tautomeric forms,
and 3D conformations for 15 496 SMILES (246 known BRD4 ligands
and 15 250 decoy compounds) were generated using LigPrep (Schrödinger
2014.2). The default conditions were maintained, except for the ionization
states which were generated at the target pH of 7 ± 2 using Epik
including the original state. The resulting 3D ligand representations
were exported as structure data files, and unique IDs were assigned
based on unique canonical structures to facilitate postdocking hierarchical
data fusion as previously described.

Docking Protocol
Ligand representations obtained via
LigPrep for all (BRD4 known active and decoy) compounds were docked
against all nine prepared BRD4(1) models using Glide (Schrödinger
2014.2) in standard precision (SP) with the default settings, except
writing out at most 5 poses per ligand representation and including
25 poses per ligand for postdocking minimization. All docking results
were exported from Maestro 9.5 as delimited text files. The docking
scores were aggregated hierarchically at three levels, at each level
generating average and top docking scores as follows: (i) for each
unique ligand representation structure, the scores of all corresponding
docking poses were aggregated; (ii) pose-aggregate scores of unique
ligand representations (generated in LigPrep) were aggregated by unique
(original) compound structure (across ionization states and tautomers);
and (iii) aggregate compound scores were combined across all protein
structures. At the ligand representation level, we considered top
and average top 3 and average top 5 pose scores; at the compound level,
the top and average of all corresponding ligand representations; and
at the protein level, the top and average top 3 and top 5 scores,
giving a total of 18 aggregation methods. On the basis of the model
evaluation results for all aggregation methods, for the final results
we used the top scores obtained across all levels; for each ligand
structure, this corresponds to the best pose for the best ligand representation
in the best protein-docking model.

Optimized Docking Models
We generated optimized docking
models from three MD simulation frames of the three most active sulfonamide
compounds (8302, 8110, and 8200) at 40, 45, and 50 ns in the simulation,
respectively. Docking was performed using Glide (Schrödinger
2014.2) in SP with the default settings (keeping cocrystal waters
within 5 Å of the ligand), except writing out at most 5 poses
per ligand representation and including 25 poses per ligand for postdocking
minimization. Maestro 9.5 allows export of all docking results as
delimited text files. The docking scores were aggregated first by
pose for each ligand representation, then across all representations
for each ligand (e.g., tautomers and protonation states), and then
across the protein structure (docking) models for 8302, 8110, and
8200, at each level generating average and top docking scores as described
previously.26

MM-GBSA Energy Calculations
Prime MM-GBSA calculations
were carried out using the initial and MD-optimized receptor–ligand
complexes. All default parameters were used, including the VSGB 2.0
solvation model. Calculations were performed using the Schrödinger
2016.3 software suite.

Evaluation and Characterization of Computational
Predictions
The docking method optimization was evaluated
by the ROC score
using the known BRD4 inhibitors and the large decoy dataset (described
above). The ROC score show sensitivity over 1—specificity,
that is, true positive rate over the false positive rate. On the basis
of the model evaluation results for all permutations of top and average
scores across poses, ligand representations, and protein structure
models, we ended up using the top scores obtained across all levels;
for each ligand structure, this corresponds to the best pose for the
best ligand representation in the best protein-docking model termed.
ROC curves for the initial and MD-optimized (best) docking scores
are shown in Supplementary Figure 4. Additionally,
EF at 1% top scoring compounds and correlation of aggregate docking
scores and activity data were calculated for the 908 commercially
available compounds for which activity information had been determined
(Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Table 3). EF at 1% is [true positives (top 1%)/number
of samples (top 1%)]/[positives (total)/number of samples (total)],
that is, the ratio of true positives detected in the subset divided
by the fraction of overall (total) positives. Also, a log–enrichment
curve was calculated for the initial and MD-optimized docking models
for predicted commercially available compounds (Supplementary Figure 6).

MD Simulations
All-atom (OPLS2005 force field) explicit
water MD simulations were performed using the Desmond 2014.2 software
suite (D. E. Shaw Research) via Maestro 9.8.12,14,45 MD systems were built using the highest
scoring docking pose for each sulfonamide compound. Specifically,
PDB structures 4HXS for 8236 and 8228, 3MXF for 8110, and 4LR6 for 8302, 8152, and 8200. The system boundary distances were specified
as 10.0 Å in each dimension in an orthorhombic box. For all simulations,
the Desmond default OPLS_2005 force field with simple point charge
water model and NPT (temperature (T), pressure (P), and the number
of particles(N)) ensemble was used. Desmond
automatically places Na+ ions to neutralize the system
and a salt concentration of 0.15 M and performs multiple rounds of
energy minimization and model relaxation before the production simulation.
Each 50 ns simulation was run on the Pegasus cluster from the Center
for Computational Science at the University of Miami (http://ccs.miami.edu/hpc/)
using 48 processors and completed in approximately 50 h. Simulation
analysis was performed using the Desmond trajectory analysis software.

The 500 ns MD simulation of ligand 8302 in BRD4 (BD1) (starting
from the best pose docked into 4LR6 as above) was performed using the same
parameters as described above, but it was run on an Exxact Quantum
TXR410-0128R equipped with Nvidia Tesla M40 GPUs using the GPU-accelerated
Desmond software (v2016.3) and one GPU.

Analysis of MD Simulations
MD result analysis consisted
of computing both the simulation event analysis and simulation interaction
diagrams and exporting the results to a spreadsheet and diagram for
analysis. Calculation of the trajectory ligand RMSD differences relative
to the target experimental cocrystal pose (in contrast to the default
starting docking pose) RMSD was as follows E1  where Pi refers to the ligand
pose as the
time index i, Pn is the final ligand pose at the end of the simulation,
Po is the starting ligand pose, that is, the docking pose, and Pr
is the experimentally determined reference ligand pose.

The
definition of RMSD in the course of an MD simulation is E2  where pj′(ti) corresponds to the position atom j of the
ligand with N atoms at time ti, in our
case Pi, and pj(tref) corresponds to the position of the ligand
atom at a reference time point (usually time 0). E1 transforms RMSD of Pi relative time point 0 (Po) into RMSD relative
to the absolute (simulation independent) reference pose Pr, the experimental
ligand conformation. These calculations were implemented in Python
after exporting RMSD data from Maestro for all six MD trajectories.

Ligand Shape Similarity
The ROCS 3.2.0 shape similarity
screening software (Open Eye Scientific)29,46 was utilized to evaluate ligand 3D shape and electrostatic similarity
between the experimentally determined active N-[3-(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide
compounds to all known BRD4 active compounds. The ROCS query was created
from six aligned sulfonamide compounds exported from their best BRD4
docking pose (see above). The option to merge color atoms was selected,
best hits defined as 100, shape only set to false, rank by set to
Tanimoto Combo, and random starts set to 50. The Tanimoto Combo score
was the main metric evaluated by our study.

Experimental Determination
of Binding Activity
BRD4(1) AlphaScreen and DSF Assays
To perform the BRD4(1)
AlphaScreen and DSF assays, we followed the same protocol described
previously.26 Compounds were obtained from Enamine, LLC, and the supplier provided
purity confirmed ≥95% for each compound based on high-performance
liquid chromatography; the traces can be found in the Supporting Information. To confirm assay results,
we perform a PerkinElmer TruHits counter screen with the same assay
system to determine if any compounds were interacting with the assay
components, allowing for the determination of possible false positives.

X-Ray Crystallography and Structure Determination
Crystals
of BRD4-1 were grown in the presence of 1 mM ligand and 10% (v/v)
DMSO from vapor-diffusion hanging drops using reservoir as described
previously,47 harvested in cryoprotectant
(reservoir containing 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and 0.5 mM ligand)
and flash frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas. X-ray diffraction data
were recorded at −180 °C in the Moffitt Cancer Center
Structural Biology Core using Cu Kα X-rays generated by a Rigaku
MicroMax 007-HF X-ray generator, focused by mirror optics, and equipped
with a Rigaku CCD Saturn 944 system and a Rigaku R-AXIS HTC imager.
Data were reduced and scaled with XDS;48 PHENIX49 was employed for phasing and
refinement, and model building was performed using Coot.50 The structure was solved by molecular replacement
using Phaser51 and the monomer of PDB entry 4O7A(47) as the search model. Initial models for the small-molecule
ligands were generated using MarvinSketch (ChemAxon, Cambridge, MA)
with ligand restraints from eLBOW of the PHOENIX suite. All structures
were validated by MolProbity52 and phenix.model_vs_data.53 Figures were prepared using PyMOL (Schrödinger,
LLC).
