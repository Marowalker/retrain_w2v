Diamine oxidase (DAO)
is an enzyme involved in the regulation of
cell proliferation and the immune response. This enzyme performs oxidative
deamination in the catabolism of biogenic amines, including, among
others, histamine, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. The mechanistic
details underlying the reductive half-reaction of the DAO-catalyzed
oxidative deamination which leads to the reduced enzyme cofactor and
the aldehyde product are, however, still under debate. The catalytic
mechanism was proposed to involve a prototropic shift from the substrate–Schiff
base to the product–Schiff base, which includes the rate-limiting
cleavage of the Cα–H bond by the conserved catalytic
aspartate. Our detailed mechanistic study, performed using a combined
quantum chemical cluster approach with empirical valence bond simulations,
suggests that the rate-limiting cleavage of the Cα–H
bond involves direct hydride transfer to the topaquinone cofactor—a
mechanism that does not involve the formation of a Schiff base. Additional
investigation of the D373E and D373N variants supported the hypothesis
that the conserved catalytic aspartate is indeed essential for the
reaction; however, it does not appear to serve as the catalytic base,
as previously suggested. Rather, the electrostatic contributions of
the most significant residues (including D373), together with the
proximity of the Cu2+ cation to the reaction site, lower
the activation barrier to drive the chemical reaction.

==== Body
Introduction
Amine oxidases (AOs)
are a group of enzymes that catalyze the degradation
of amines into the corresponding aldehydes with the concomitant production
of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia, as shown in Scheme 1. They are divided into two structurally
distinct classes of enzymes, depending on the cofactor involved in
the oxidative deamination reaction:1−3 (i) the copper-containing
AOs [e.g., diamine oxidase (DAO)], and (ii) the flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing
AOs [e.g., monoamine oxidase B (MAO B)]. Both DAO and MAO B are involved
in histamine degradation in the human body4 and are thus crucial for the regulation of histamine at physiological
concentrations.

Scheme 1 General Reaction of AOs
In the central nervous system, histamine degradation is
initiated
by its methylation with histamine N-methyltransferase
(HNMT), producing N-methylhistamine, which is inactive
at the histamine receptor sites and which is further oxidized by MAO
B to the corresponding imine. The imine leaves MAO B and undergoes
non-enzymatic hydrolysis to the respective aldehyde,5,6 which is rapidly further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to t-methyl-imidazoleacetic acid (Scheme 2a).7 In contrast,
in peripheral tissues, DAO acts directly on histamine (Scheme 2b), yielding imidazoleacetic
acid as the end product of histamine degradation.7 Because of its broad substrate specificity, including activity
toward histamine-related compounds such as N-methylhistamine,8 and others like cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane),9 putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane),8 and the polyamine spermidine,8 DAO is a frontline enzyme for the degradation of exogenous amines.
Hence, reduced levels of both DAO activity and expression have been
directly linked to histamine intolerance.4 This, in turn, leads to numerous unpleasant symptoms, including,
for example, diarrhea, headaches, nasal congestion, asthmatoid wheezing,
hypotension, and arrhythmia, as described in ref (4) and references cited therein.

Scheme 2 Pathways for the Degradation of Histidine by the Enzymes: (a) MAO
B and (b) DAO
The DAO-catalyzed
oxidative deamination consists of reductive and
oxidative half-reactions. While the former leads to the reduced enzyme
cofactor and the aldehyde product,10 the
latter involves the reoxidation of the enzyme cofactor by molecular
oxygen, which produces ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 1). Measurements of primary
kinetic isotope effects indicated that the rate-limiting step of these
reactions is the cleavage of the Cα–H bond.11 Oxidation of p-dimethylaminomethylbenzylamine
and its deuterated analogue by DAO gave kH/kD values up to 5.5.11 This led the authors to propose a mechanism that involves
the formation of a Schiff-base between the amine group of the substrate
and the C5-carbonyl atom of the 2,4,5-trihydroxy phenylalanine-quinone
(TPQ) cofactor (Scheme 3). The prototropic shift from the substrate–Schiff base to
the product–Schiff base includes the rate-limiting cleavage
of the Cα–H bond,11−14 as postulated in a study where 2-hydroxy-5-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone was used as a model for the
topaquinone (TPQ) cofactor to study the mechanism of benzylamine oxidation
in acetonitrile.12 According to the proposed
mechanism (Scheme 3), benzylamine and the model cofactor (TPQox) form a covalent
substrate–Schiff base complex (TPQs–Sb),
followed by the base-catalyzed proton abstraction from the substrate–Schiff
base complex, resulting in the product–Schiff base complex
(TPQp–Sb). The product–Schiff base complex
is finally hydrolyzed to an aldehyde and the aminoresorcinol form
of the reduced cofactor (TPQred). In the enzyme-catalyzed
reaction, a conserved aspartate residue was proposed to act as the
catalytic base.15

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism
for the Copper AO Catalyzed Oxidative Deamination
of Amines, Adapted from Ref (16)
Extensive mutagenesis
studies have indicated that D383 of Escherichia coli AO (ecAO) is critical
for this enzyme’s catalytic activity.13,14 That is, the D383E variant showed very low, but measurable, activity.13 The D383N and D383A variants were inactive,
with the former having drastically reduced affinity for the 2-hydrazinopyridine
inhibitor, compared to the wild-type (WT) enzyme.14 It was, therefore, concluded that D383 performs an essential
role in catalysis, acting as the catalytic base, allowing the conversion
of a substrate–Schiff to a product–Schiff base complex.

The role of the copper ion has also been extensively studied,17,18 indicating its necessity for the catalytic mechanism of these AOs.
It was shown that the copper-free form of the pig-kidney AO completely
lost its activity.18 Upon the addition
of copper, however, the enzyme activity was fully restored.18 It was also demonstrated that Ni2+ and Zn2+ do not bind the protein, whereas Co2+ can be incorporated to the same extent as Cu2+, but the
Co-reconstituted enzyme shows only very modest activity.18

The present study aims to elucidate the
catalytic mechanism of
the oxidative deamination of histamine by human DAO (hDAO) and to investigate the role of the catalytic D373 residue, which
corresponds to D383 in the homologous enzyme ecAO.
To address these issues, we performed quantum-mechanical (QM) cluster
calculations of the enzyme active site,19 followed by empirical valence bond (EVB)20−22 calculations
of the full system that allowed us to calculate the reaction free
energies. Our calculations show that the rate-limiting step of histamine
degradation is the cleavage of the Cα–H bond, as previously
described.11 However, the reaction proceeds
via direct hydride transfer from histamine to the TPQ cofactor, thus
ruling out the previously proposed Schiff-base formation. Moreover,
studies of the D373E and D373N variants indeed prove that the conserved
catalytic aspartate is essential for the reaction, but it does not
serve as the catalytic base, as previously proposed.23 By describing the catalytic mechanism of hDAO in detail, we provide a fundamental understanding of this enzyme
that is necessary for the design of therapeutics for the treatment
of histamine intolerance.4,24

Results and Discussion
QM Cluster
Models
As the starting point of this work,
we used QM cluster models of DAO, together with models of the corresponding
non-enzymatic reaction, to probe the proposed mechanism of this enzyme
through the formation of a substrate–Schiff base complex.12,25 Such models have been used extensively to study enzymatic reaction
mechanisms,19,26 as well as being the basis of
the “theozymes” used for de novo enzyme design purposes.27,28 Our initial model systems for the non-enzymatic reaction included
(i) histamine and the TPQ cofactor as well as (ii) an extended model
including histamine, TPQ, and a Cu2+ ion. Both models were
optimized at the M11L/6-31G(d) level of theory, with the addition
of the SDD basis set for the extended model with copper. Using this
approach, it was not possible to obtain an optimized structure for
the substrate–Schiff base complex in either the gas phase or
continuum solvent [using the conductor-like polarizable continuum
model (CPCM),29 with a dielectric constant
of 80]. In all attempts to obtain this complex, potential energy surface
scanning resulted in quinone-ring opening, which suggests that it
is highly unlikely that such a substrate–Schiff base complex
exists in the absence of the enzyme.

To examine whether this
mechanism is possible in the hDAO active site, we
created a larger QM cluster model of the enzyme. This model consisted
of the histamine substrate, the Cu2+ cation, the TPQ cofactor,
and the active site residues (i.e., D373, Y371, W376, Y459, H510,
H512, and H675), as shown in Figure 1. All amino acid side chains and the TPQ cluster were
truncated at the Cα-atom and capped with methyl groups. The
histamine was modeled in its neutral unionized form. Although it has
been shown that the substrate binds the active site in its protonated
form,30 the substrate needs to be deprotonated
to its unionized form to both restore its nucleophilic character and
initiate the reaction shown in Scheme 3.31,32 Because the physiological pKa value of histamine is around 9.4, the latter
can easily be achieved by active site water molecules with a cost
of only a few kcal·mol–1.33 In addition, the pKa of the
4-hydroxyl group of the TPQ cofactor has been suggested to be as low
as ∼3, which is in part due to its proximity to the catalytic
Cu2+ ion which will stabilize the charge on the oxyanion
and facilitate its deprotonation.34 Therefore,
deprotonating the TPQ cofactor in the active site will be facile,
and in our simulations, it was modeled as an oxyanion, because this
form was shown to exist in the active site even before the reaction
occurs.35 The resulting cluster model was
embedded into continuum solvent, using the CPCM model with a dielectric
constant of 4.

(c) product
states for the DAO-catalyzed oxidation of histamine obtained using
a QM cluster model to represent the active site of hDAO. Nonpolar hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity. Rather
than annotating (and overcrowding) the figure, the associated key
distances are shown in Table S1, and the
associated coordinates are also provided in the Supporting Information.

Once the optimized reactant complex was obtained, we performed
an energy scan along the distance between the nitrogen atom of the
chain amino group of histamine and the C5-carbonyl atom of the TPQ
cofactor. As can be seen from Figure S1, it was not possible to locate a transition state along this reaction
coordinate. We therefore examined other mechanistic possibilities.
Our previous computational work on the related enzyme, MAO B, makes
a one electron (radical) pathway highly unlikely;36 we therefore focused on the direct hydride transfer from
the substrate Cα–H moiety to the DAO cofactor, which
is analogous to the mechanism proposed for the MAO-catalyzed oxidative
deamination of amine substrates.36−41 We note that it has been recently shown, both experimentally and
computationally, that C–H hydrogen bond donors directly transfer
the hydride anion to the carbonyl oxygen of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone,
which is often used model quinone in mechanistic studies.42,43 Moreover, copper-promoted hydride transfer to a carbonyl group was
previously reported as well.44 Therefore,
we modeled the reaction where Cα–H hydride cleavage from
the histamine substrate involves a direct transfer of the hydride
anion (H–) to the carbonyl O5-atom of the TPQ cofactor
(Figure 2). QM calculations
were performed using the same cluster model of the enzyme as described
above. For the reaction coordinate, we selected the distance between
the donor Cα–H atom of the histamine and the carbonyl
O5 atom of the TPQ cofactor. All calculations were performed at the
(CPCM)/M11L/6-311++G(2df,2pd)-SDD//(CPCM)/M11L/6-31G(d)-SDD level
of theory, as described in the Methodology section.

using a QM cluster model (blue). The feasible, but slightly less favorable,
mechanistic alternative involving histamine deprotonation by the side
chain of the active site D373 in the second step of the reductive
half-reaction is shown in red. The experimental activation energy
is displayed in pink. All energies are in kcal·mol–1. A simplified version of the cluster model used in the present work,
showing only the main reacting atoms, is also presented for clarity.

Figure 2 shows the
relevant QM-optimized stationary points for the DAO catalyzed oxidative
degradation of histamine. The relevant interaction distances are shown
in Table S1, and the corresponding coordinates
are provided in the Supporting Information. In the reactant state, the histamine is oriented toward the TPQ
cofactor in a favorable conformation for the reaction to occur, forming
hydrogen bonds between its amino group and the side-chain carboxylate
of D373, as well between the histamine-ring imino nitrogen and the
side-chain oxygen atom of Y459. The distances between the reacting
atoms of histamine and TPQ at the reactant state, i.e., Cα–O5
and Hα–O5, are 3.2 and 2.6 Å, respectively. At the
transition state, the hydrogen being transferred is asymmetrically
located between the Cα-carbon and the O5-acceptor atom on the
TPQ cofactor, with Cα–H and O5–H distances of
1.4 and 1.1 Å, respectively. We note here that the calculated
activation free energy for this process is 23.7 kcal·mol–1 (vimag = 1012i cm–1), which is significantly higher than the experimental
value (17.1 kcal·mol–1,8 derived from the experimentally obtained kcat of 139 min–1, using the Eyring–Polanyi
equation45), and therefore, further EVB
simulations20−22 were performed to probe this reaction, as described
in the next section. We, however, note that the activation free energy
of 23.7 kcal·mol–1 is comparable to the value
of 24.4 kcal·mol–1 for the analogous reaction
in MAO B that we previously obtained using the same QM-only cluster
approach.33

Natural bond orbital
(NBO)46 analysis
of the QM optimized geometries demonstrates that this process is indeed
associated with the transfer of a hydride anion, as can be seen from
the calculated atomic charges (Table 1). In the reactant state, the sum of the partial charges
on the atoms of histamine and the TPQ cofactor are 0.02 and −1.02,
respectively. However, at the transition state, the partial charges
change to 0.25 and −1.25, respectively, indicating a transfer
of negative charge to the TPQ cofactor. Following the hydride abstraction,
the system proceeds to the corresponding intermediates, characterized
by the semireduced TPQ cofactor and the cationic substrate (Figures 1 and 2). The charge distribution further indicates that the formation
of the new O5–H bond increases the total negative charge on
the TPQ cofactor to −1.40, while simultaneously the total positive
charge on the histamine increases to 0.80. The following step in the
amine oxidation involves deprotonation of the substrate amino group
by the O2 atom of the TPQ cofactor (for a definition of the atom naming,
see Table 1). This
step is facilitated by the increase in the negative charge on the
O2 atom of the TPQ cofactor during the hydride transfer reaction.
This process is calculated to have a very low activation energy of
1.7 kcal·mol–1 (vimag = 1056i cm–1) and is thus facile, making the initial
hydride abstraction the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction.
Finally, the overall reaction free energy (relative to the reactant
state) is −2.5 kcal·mol–1, resulting
in a neutral trans-imine and fully reduced TPQ cofactor as the final
products (Figure 2).

state, and intermediate state, respectively.

To explore the putative role of the active site residue
D373 in
deprotonating the cationic substrate during the second step of the
reaction, as an alternative to the O2 atom of the TPQ cofactor, we
also examined this pathway (Figure 2). Our calculations show that such a pathway is plausible,
although the reaction proceeds through the transition state with a
notably higher activation energy (4 kcal·mol–1 relative to the intermediate and 9.7 kcal·mol–1 relative to the reactant state) and with a slightly less stable
product state (ΔG0 = 4.0 kcal·mol–1). However, both pathways are substantially lower
in energy than the initial hydride transfer step and are therefore
likely to be viable options to complete the reaction.

EVB Simulations
While our calculations using the QM
cluster model strongly suggest that DAO utilizes a hydride transfer
mechanism similar to that in MAO B, the calculated activation energy
of 23.7 kcal·mol–1 is substantially higher
than the experimental value of 17.1 kcal·mol–1.8 This discrepancy could, in part, be
due to either an incomplete electrostatic treatment in the continuum
solvent model or due to insufficient conformational sampling. To address
these issues, we complemented our QM cluster calculations with EVB20−22 simulations using the two-state model described in Figure S2.

A fundamental part of the EVB philosophy
is the need for a well-defined reference state, which can be either
the non-enzymatic reaction in vacuum or in solution or the WT enzyme
against a series of mutants (see detailed discussion in, e.g., refs (21, 22)). The reference state is then parameterized to reproduce either
experimental data, where available, or higher-level QM calculations,
where experimental data is lacking. The obtained parameters are then
transferred to describe the same chemical reaction in different environments.
Such an approach is feasible because of the demonstrated phase-independence
of the EVB off-diagonal elements, as validated in ref (47). In the present case,
due to the lack of experimental data to describe non-enzymatic histamine
degradation in aqueous solution, it is necessary to fit the non-enzymatic
reference state to energies obtained from higher-level QM calculations.
For simplicity, we have performed our reference calculations in vacuum
to avoid artifacts introduced by using continuum rather than explicit
solvation. We then performed EVB simulations in vacuum, as described
in the Methodology section, fitting to the
quantum chemical calculations, and then using the same parameters
to study the reaction in solution and the DAO active site, as in previous
work.38,41 The vacuum energetics of the reaction were
calculated at the M11L/6-31G(d) level of theory, with zero-point energies
and entropies calculated from the vibrational frequencies at the same
level of theory as the geometry optimizations. The model for the direct
hydride transfer reaction consisted of neutral histamine and TPQ cofactor
with a deprotonated hydroxyl group. The obtained transition state
was verified by frequency analysis (vimag = 745i cm–1), as well as by following the intrinsic
reaction coordinate in the reactant and product directions,48 which yielded an activation free energy, ΔG⧧, of 51.5 kcal·mol–1, and a reaction free energy, ΔG0, of 50.8 kcal·mol–1. These extremely large
values are consistent with the expectation that the investigated hydride
transfer would be extremely unfavorable in the gas phase.

The
EVB free energies, obtained using the calibration parameters
shown in Table S2, are given in Figure 3a. As our QM cluster
calculations indicated that the hydride transfer is the rate-limiting
step of the overall process, we have focused only on this step in
our EVB calculations. From this data, it can be seen that, as expected,
the inclusion of solvent effects already substantially reduces the
hydride transfer barrier even for the non-enzymatic reaction. The
barrier is further reduced in the hDAO active site,
yielding a calculated activation free energy of 14.8 kcal·mol–1. Previous studies have shown that protonated histamine
is likely bound to the active site; however, deprotonated (neutral)
histamine is essential for the reaction to take place. Thus, an intraenzymatic
deprotonation of histamine must occur within the enzyme active site,
the cost of which would be expected to be 2.7 kcal·mol–1 at physiological pH (assuming a pKa of
9.4 for histamine and using the relationship ΔGPT = 2.303RT(pKa(donor) – pH)). The cost of this deprotonation, which
approximately equals the difference between the calculated free energy
of activation of 14.8 kcal·mol–1 and the experimental
value of 17.1 kcal·mol–1 (derived from kcat = 139 min–1),8 needs to be added to the calculated value to
account for the initial histamine deprotonation. This yields an overall
calculated free energy of 17.5 kcal·mol–1,
in excellent agreement with the experimental value, thus giving credence
to our proposed mechanism (Table 2).

in refs (21, 22).

Finally, we note that our EVB
calculations predict an activation
free energy of 26.6 kcal·mol–1 for the non-enzymatic
reaction in aqueous solution, leading to a barrier reduction of 11.8
kcal·mol–1 upon moving to the enzyme active
site. This would correspond to a tremendous rate acceleration of 109-fold compared to the non-enzymatic reaction. This substantial
rate enhancement is comparable in magnitude to the similarly large
rate enhancement observed computationally in MAO B-catalyzed dopamine
oxidation, which has been demonstrated to operate through the same
direct hydride transfer mechanism.38 The
hydride transfer is also predicted to be thermodynamically favorable,
with a calculated reaction free energy, ΔG0, of −2.9 kcal·mol–1.

Roles
of D373 and the Metal Cofactor
Following from
our modeling of the WT enzyme, we have also investigated the role
of D373 in the catalytic mechanism by mutating this residue both to
glutamine and the isostructural, but chemically distinct, asparagine
(Figure 4). It was
experimentally shown that the D373E mutation leads to low but still
detectable activity, whereas the corresponding mutation to asparagine
completely abolishes the catalytic activity (Table 2).14 On the basis
of this, it has been proposed that D373 acts as the catalytic base
by abstracting proton from the substrate–Schiff base complex
to produce the product–Schiff base complex (Scheme 3, :B–). However,
we demonstrate here (Table 2) that we obtain good agreement with experiment when modeling
this reaction as proceeding through a direct hydride transfer mechanism.
Specifically, as can be seen from the obtained EVB energetics, the
calculated activation free energy for the rate-limiting step of direct
hydride transfer in the D373N hDAO variant is 29.1
kcal·mol–1, which is a loss in activity of
approximately 10 orders of magnitude compared to that calculated for
the WT enzyme (with ΔGcalc⧧ = 14.8 kcal·mol–1). Also, there is an extremely high thermodynamic
barrier to this process, as reflected in the reaction free energy
of 19.9 kcal·mol–1. Therefore, our calculations
predict a complete loss of activity for this variant, based on the
direct hydride transfer mechanism. Following from this, in the case
of the D373E variant, we calculate an activation free energy of 19.4
kcal·mol–1, in reasonable agreement with the
experimental value of 21.5 kcal·mol–1 for ecAO.14 We also note that in
the case of ecAO, this mutation increases the activation
free energy by 6.1 kcal·mol–1. While we do
not have the corresponding experimental value for the hDAO mutants, our calculated ΔΔGcalc⧧ of 4.6
kcal·mol–1 for mutant versus WT hDAO is in good agreement with the observations from E. coli (where ΔΔGexp⧧ is 6.1
kcal·mol–1). Here, we take into account that,
as shown in Table 2, WT hDAO is less active than the corresponding
enzyme from E. coli.

Figure 4 Representative EVB transition
state structures for the reactions
catalyzed by (a) WT hDAO and its (b) D373E and (c)
D373N mutants in complex with histamine. The average distances between
the active site residues, computed over the TS trajectory, are shown
in Å, and the complete statistics is provided in Table S3.

From a structural perspective, our EVB simulations show that,
in
the calculated transition states (Figure 4a), D373 forms hydrogen bonds with the amino
group of histamine (average distance 2.7 ± 0.1 Å and average
angle 165.4 ± 7.9°) and with the side chain of Y463 (2.7
± 0.1 Å). In the transition state of the D373E mutant, however,
E373 forms hydrogen bonds primarily with W376 (2.8 ± 0.2 Å)
and Y463 (2.6 ± 0.1 Å), thus bridging the two residues and
not being engaged in hydrogen bonding with amino group of histamine
(3.0 ± 0.2 Å and 142.7 ± 13.8°), which implies
that this hydrogen bond is lost at the transition state. At the same
time, the average distance between the cofactor TPQ:O2 and Cu2+ cation is 2.10 ± 0.03 Å for WT DAO in contrast
to 3.7 ± 0.2 Å for D373E. This distance further increases
to 4.4 ± 0.1 Å for the D373N mutant (Figure 4). The electrostatic contributions of the
most significant residues (Figure 5) show that the protein residue at position 373 (i.e.,
D in the wild type, E or N in mutants) affects catalysis the most
(while some other residues also make contributions, as annotated in
this figure, the contributions are similar between the different enzyme
variants, and mostly cancel each out). Thus, the difference in the
free energy of activation between the WT and D373E or D373N mutant
enzyme may be explained by a combination of the loss of stabilizing
interactions from the catalytic Cu2+ cation, together with
(in the case of the N373 variant) a slight loss of stabilizing interaction
from D373, which in turn leads to the loss of activity.

a contribution >1 kcal·mol–1) to the calculated
activation free energies (ΔΔGelec,RS→TS⧧) of the hDAO-catalyzed direct hydride transfer
reaction. The depicted values were obtained by applying the linear
response approximation to the calculated EVB trajectories and scaled
by assuming an active site dielectric constant of 4, as in our previous
work (ref (49)).

Conclusions
In
this work, we combined QM cluster calculations and EVB simulations
to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of the DAO catalyzed oxidative
deamination of histamine. Our results indicate that direct hydride
transfer from the substrate Cα–H moiety to the O5 atom
of TPQ cofactor is the rate-limiting step of the reductive half-reaction,
which is in line with the experimentally confirmed rate-limiting step.

predict an almost 9 orders of magnitude rate enhancement in comparison
to the corresponding non-enzymatic reaction in aqueous solution. The
same rate enhancement was observed for the equivalent reaction catalyzed
by the MAO B enzyme on monoamines.38 Moreover,
we have also shown that while D373 is indeed essential for DAO catalysis,
its role is not proton abstraction during the catalytic cycle, as
previously proposed.12−14 Namely, the average hydrogen bond distances at the
transition state combined with the electrostatic contributions of
the most significant residues (in terms of energetic contributions)
to the calculated activation free energies showed that proximity of
the Cu2+ cation, together with the residue D373, affect
catalysis the most, with the loss of key interactions with these moieties
leading to the observed loss of activities in the D373E and D373N
variants. In conjunction with our previous work,40 the results presented here suggest that the in vivo degradation
of histamine to yield an aldehyde always occurs via the same catalytic
mechanism, namely direct hydride transfer from histamine and N-methylhistamine to the corresponding cofactor (TPQ or
FAD, respectively), regardless of the histamine catabolic pathway.
A detailed understanding of the mechanism of histamine-degrading enzymes
is important for the design of therapeutics for the treatment of histamine
intolerance, bearing in mind that no medication to date is able to
increase DAO activity and therefore keep the level of histamine degradation
in balance. Insufficient histamine degradation by DAO however may
also disrupt the other histamine-degrading pathway operating through
HNMT and MAO B, resulting in the collapse of histamine clearance.50,51 Therefore, the catalytic mechanism of the degradation of this possibly
harmful compound is important for the successful development of drugs
that could supplement impaired histamine-degradation pathways.

Methodology
QM Calculations
The cluster model of the DAO active
site used in this work consisted of the substrate histamine, the Cu2+ cation, the TPQ cofactor, and the active site residues D373,
Y371, W376, Y459, H510, H512, and H675, as shown in Figure 1. Geometries for all key stationary
points were optimized using the M11L functional52 at the M11L/6-31G(d) level of theory, with the thermal
Gibbs free energy corrections extracted from frequency calculations
at the same level of theory without scaling factors applied. A further
single point calculation was performed with the larger 6-311++G(2df,2pd)
basis set to refine the electronic energies. The results of these
calculations are shown in Figure 2 and Table S4.

System Setup
for the EVB Simulations
To calibrate our
EVB simulations of the enzyme catalyzed reactions, we performed corresponding
simulation of the non-enzymatic reaction in vacuum. The EVB gas-phase
shift and coupling parameters (α20 and H12, Table S2) were obtained by fitting these simulations
to ΔG⧧ and ΔG0 obtained from QM calculations in vacuum at
the M11L/6-31G(d) level of theory and then using the same parameter
set for the reactions in aqueous solution and in the enzyme active
site. All QM calculations are performed using the Gaussian 09 package.53

The starting points for our EVB simulations
of DAO were the coordinates of DAO in complex with the inhibitor aminoguanidine
(PDB ID: 3MPH).54 The D373E and D373N mutants of DAO
were generated using the Dunbrack backbone-dependent rotamer library,55 as implemented in Chimera.56 The position of the inhibitor in this structure served
as a reference point for initial manual positioning of the substrate
(i.e., histamine) into the hDAO active site. Short
MD simulations of 5 ns were then performed to obtain equilibrated
and optimized structures, which served as a starting point for the
subsequent protein parameterization. The protein model included one
subunit of hDAO enclosed in a simulation sphere,
with a 30 Å radius, centered at the reactive Cα of the
substrate. All protein atoms outside this sphere were kept restrained
to their starting positions by applying a 200 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 harmonic restraint. All ionized
residues in simulations are listed in Table S5. Other ionizable residues outside this region were kept in their
neutral state. All simulations were performed using the OPLS-AA force
field,57,58 and the copper ion in this enzyme was reparametrized
to reproduce the correct tetrahedral coordination, based on the previously
published copper dummy model by Liao et al.59 This model has been successful in reproducing the Jahn–Teller
effect seen in divalent copper and was deemed an excellent starting
point for the reparametrization.

All molecular dynamics and
EVB simulations in this work were performed
using the Q (v5.10) simulation package.60 The resulting structure of DAO in complex with histamine was equilibrated
and gradually heated to 300 K over a short 25 ps simulation. The system
was further equilibrated at 300 K, performing 10 ns of MD simulation
starting at the transition state, for each reaction. An initial 200
kcal·mol–1·Å–2 harmonic
restraint was applied on all heavy atoms in the simulation sphere
to remove bad contacts. This was gradually reduced during the initial
heating phase, while only a 0.5 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 restraint was left on the reacting atoms of the substrate
histamine and TPQ cofactor. All solvent hydrogen atoms were constrained
by the SHAKE algorithm,61 and system temperatures
were regulated using the Berendsen thermostat62 with a 100 fs bath relaxation time. For the calculation of all nonbonded
interactions, a cut-off value of 10 Å was used, with the exception
of those involving reacting atoms for which a 99 Å cut-off (i.e.,
no cut-off) was used. The endpoint structure of the equilibration
run was used as a starting point for the subsequent EVB simulations.
The equilibrated structure was subjected to 10 parallel FEP runs by
randomizing the atomic velocities to perform independent EVB calculations
and ensure reliable sampling. The mapping procedure was performed
in 51 mapping frames of 100 ps each, yielding a total simulation time
of 5.1 ns per replica.

Substrate and Cofactor Parameterization
The program
Q,60 used for the EVB simulations, and
GROMACS,63 which was employed in the original
Cu-model paper, use different force field descriptions and the former
does not apply particle mesh Ewald summation for the long-range electrostatic
interactions. Therefore, the published Cu parameters were further
validated and optimized to allow a better fit with the previous experimental
data.64 For the new parameters, both the
repulsive and attractive parts of the center particle of the ion model
were optimized in respect to the resulting hydration free energies
and ion–water radial distribution functions. It was also necessary
to reduce the repulsive force on the non-interacting dummy particles
from the 0.03 kcal·mol–1·Å–6, used in the previous dummy model paper,65 to 0.01 kcal·mol–1·Å–6, or the reproduction of the Jahn–Teller distortions was not
possible. This setup is in line with the results obtained in the original
article with GROMACS, where no force at all was applied to the dummy
particles. This approach was not chosen to avoid singularities when
calculating the forces in Q.

The parameterization was performed
using the TIP3P water model as implemented in Q, with the dummy model
being solvated in an 18 Å water sphere subjected to the spherical
boundary conditions, according to the surface-constrained all-atom
solvent model.66 Hydrogen atoms were subjected
to the SHAKE algorithm, with long-range interactions beyond a cut-off
of 10 Å being treated using the LRF approach.67 The metal dummy was kept in the simulation sphere by applying
a weak position restraint of 0.5 kcal·mol–1·Å–2. After relaxing the system by gradually
increasing temperature over the course of 60 ps, the final coordinates
were used to start five independent calculations of the solvation
free energy, using 51 umbrella-sampling windows of 100 ps simulation
time each (5.1 ns simulation time per trajectory). The analysis of
the free energies was performed using the Qfep tool of the Q program
suite. The radial distribution function was calculated, from three
1 ns-long independent MD simulations, using VMD (1.9.1),68 employing a bin size of 0.01 and a cut-off of
10 Å (Figure S3).

The parameters
for nonstandard protein residues (substrate and
cofactor) were obtained using the ffld_server as implemented in Schrödinger’s
Macromodel suite69 allowing for the construction
of the relevant EVB force fields to correctly describe the reactant
and product states of the hDAO-catalyzed reaction
(Tables S6–S10). For both states,
atomic charges were determined by fitting to the electrostatic potentials
computed by the QM calculations at the HF/6-31G(d) level of theory
according to the RESP scheme, as implemented in AmberTools15.70
