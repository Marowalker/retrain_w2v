Two
different organocatalytic cascade reaction pathways have been
developed toward the diversified synthesis of chromane-containing
polyheterocyclic compounds from the readily available starting materials.
The application of Hantzsch ester is proposed to be the key to achieve
the switch between these two different cascade reaction pathways,
and then the electron-deficient 1-aza-1,3-butadienes could be used
as the four-atom and two-carbon unit, respectively, to react with
2-hydroxy cinnamaldehydes in a highly regio- and stereocontrolled
manner. On the basis of larger-scale synthesis, further transformations
of the obtained products have also been realized, leading to cycloadducts
with high structural and stereogenic complexity bearing five stereogenic
centers, and one is a tetrasubstituted stereocenter.

Introduction
Chiral polyheterocyclic
structures, especially those containing
potential pharmacophores with multiple stereocenters, have attracted
the continuous attention of the synthetic community owing to their
wide range of biological properties.1 Despite
extensive efforts, the development of novel synthetic strategies for
the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of polyheterocyclic compounds from
the readily available starting materials is still appealing but poses
synthetic challenges, which may be attributed to the formation of
multiple stereocenters in a completely stereocontrolled manner.

The enantioselective organocatalytic cascade reactions have been
considered as powerful synthetic tools that enable the use of readily
accessible starting materials to construct complex targets, particularly
polyheterocyclic compounds with multiple stereocenters.2 Electron-deficient 1-aza-1,3-butadienes are versatile
synthetic building blocks that allow for a wide range of cascade reactions
to prepare nitrogen-containing chiral polycyclic compounds.3 Among the reported examples (Scheme 1), 1-aza-1,3-butadienes are
commonly used as a four-atom unit for [4 + 2] annulations, such as
the inverse-electron-demand aza-Diels–Alder reaction, to construct
hydropyridine derivatives,4 whereas the
applications of 1-aza-1,3-butadienes as a two-carbon unit for [4 +
2] annulations has been much less developed.5

Scheme 1 Applications of 1-Aza-1,3-butadienes in [4 + 2] Annulation Reactions
We recently found that chroman-2-ol
could be directly used in the
asymmetric enamine catalysis to access chiral polyheterocyclic compounds
bearing a chromane fragment,6 which is
the main core of a wide variety of biologically active compounds.7 Although 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehyde could serve
as the valuable precursor of chroman-2-ol under iminium-catalyzed
reduction conditions, this feature opens the possibility of discovering
the new application of 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehyde for the preparation
of structurally diverse polyheterocyclic molecules via sequential
cascade procedures.8 Indeed, there are
other two reported examples of iminium-catalyzed enantioselective
oxa-Michael-initiated cascade reactions, where the 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehyde
was used to react with electron-deficient olefins,9 such as nitroolefins and methyleneindolinones, for the
preparation of polysubstituted chromane derivatives with good results.
However, despite the wide applicability of 1-aza-1,3-butadienes in
the sequential cascade synthesis of chiral polycyclic compounds, to
the best of our knowledge, there is no report of asymmetric synthesis
of highly functionalized chromane derivatives via [4 + 2] cycloaddition
of 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehydes with 1-aza-1,3-butadienes as a two-carbon
unit, leading to the products with the remaining ketimine moiety of
1-aza-1,3-butadienes, which offers ample opportunity for further transformations
to provide diversified polyheterocyclic frameworks with high molecular
and stereogenic complexity.

As a continuation of our ongoing
investigation on the application
of hemiacetals in organocatalytic asymmetric reactions to construct
chiral polyheterocyclic structures,10 we
became interested in designing a novel and reliable organocatalytic
strategy, which could impart precise assignment of the roles between
the reaction components, for the direct assembly of skeletally diverse
chromane-containing polyheterocyclic compounds. In this work, we envisioned
that the reaction of 1-aza-1,3-butadienes 1 and 2-hydroxy
cinnamaldehyde 2a would proceed via two different reaction
pathways, and the application of Hantzsch ester 4 is
proposed to be the key to achieve role switch of both 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehydes
and 1-aza-1,3-butadienes (Scheme 2). In path a, the corresponding chroman-2-ol is formed
first by the iminium-catalyzed in situ reduction of 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehyde 2a in the presence of Hantzsch ester 4 as the
organic hydride source,11 which can subsequently
undergo enamine-catalyzed [4 + 2] cycloaddition (or inverse-electron-demand
aza-Diels–Alder reaction) to give hemiaminal intermediate 5 with the use of 1-aza-1,3-butadiene as a four-atom unit.
The subsequent acid-catalyzed iminium ion formation of hemiaminal
intermediate 5 provided the desired polycyclic aminal-containing
product 6 by a ring-closure process, whereas in path
b, 1-aza-1,3-butadiene would be used as a two-carbon unit and directly
reacts with 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehyde via an iminium-catalyzed oxa-Michael/Michael
sequence, leading to functionalized chromane derivative 7 bearing a ketimine moiety for further transformations. However,
at least two challenging problems have to be addressed in the designed
cascade process: (1) the depression of a background competitive reduction
of 1-aza-1,3-butadienes in the presence of Hantzsch ester, due to
the high reactivity of both alkene and ketimine moieties12 and (2) the undesired formation of 7 in path a.

Scheme 2 Reaction Design: Two Different Organocatalytic Cascade
Reaction Pathways
Results and Discussion
We initially focused our attention
on the development of path a.
As shown in Table 1, by using trimethylsilyl-protected prolinol catalyst 3a and p-nitrobenzoic acid (p-NBA)
as an additive in CHCl3 at 40 °C, we were delighted
to find that the one-pot cascade reaction of 1-aza-1,3-butadiene 1a, 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehyde 2a, and Hantzsch
ester 4 proceeded smoothly to afford the key hemiaminal
intermediate 5 (confirmed by 1H NMR as the
aminal form with 8:1 diastereoselectivity, whereas not the lactol
form 5′), followed by the p-toluenesulfonic
acid (p-TsOH; 3.5 equiv p-TsOH was
needed to diminish the effect of the generated stoichiometric byproduct
Hantzsch pyridine on the reaction rate)-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization
via iminium ion formation to furnish the desired polycyclic chromane
product 6a that contains three continuous stereogenic
centers and an aminal moiety in good yield with excellent enantioselectivity
as a single diastereoisomer (entry 1). It should be noted that the
whole sequential cascade process was completed in a one-pot manner
and only traces of competitive oxa-Michael initiated side product 7a (<5%) were detected, which indicated the high efficiency
of this novel catalytic strategy. The use of other acidic additives
resulted in slightly lower yields but with similar good enantioselectivities
(entries 2–4). No reaction was observed with basic additive
NaOAc (entry 5). After further examination of different solvents (entries
6–10), acetone was determined to be the most effective solvent
with regard to the yield, enantioselectivity, and reaction times of
both steps. The catalyst loading could be reduced to 10 mol % without
compromising the efficiency and enantioselectivity (entry 11).

(20 mol %) at 40 °C. After 1a was consumed, p-TsOH (3.5 equiv) was added and then the reaction mixture
was stirred at 25 °C for a specified time.

d Reaction was carried out with 3a (10 mol %) and p-NBA (20 mol %) in 0.1

Having established
the optimal reaction conditions for the application
of 1-aza-1,3-butadiene 1a as a four-atom unit in the
reaction with 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehyde 2a via a one-pot
cascade process, the substrate scope for the preparation of polycyclic
aminal-containing chromane derivatives 6 was then investigated
with regard to 1 and 2. As shown in Scheme 3, the reaction tolerates
different substituted phenyl groups in the β-position of 1 (6a–d). Moreover, 2-naphtyl-
and 2-thienyl-substituted 1 were effective substrates,
affording 6e and 6f with excellent enantio-
and diastereoselectivities. The functionalized 2b and 2c were also found to be applicable to this reaction sequence
(6g and 6h). In addition, the analogous
1-azadiene 1′ containing 1,2,3-benzoxathiazine-2,2-dioxide
motif was effectively applied in the reaction with 2a under the same reaction conditions, leading to 6h in
good yield and stereocontrol.

Scheme 3 Substrate Scope of Path a
Inspired by the successful
implementation of 1-aza-1,3-butadienes 1 as a four-atom
unit to synthesize polycyclic aminal-containing
chromane derivatives 6 by the reaction with 2-hydroxy
cinnamaldehydes 2 in the presence of Hantzsch ester 4, we further attempted to explore the use of 1-aza-1,3-butadienes 1 as a two-carbon unit in the reaction with 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehydes 2 in the absence of Hantzsch ester 4 to provide
chromane-containing polycyclic products with more structural diversity.
As shown in Table 2, a screening of a model reaction between 1a and 2a was initiated in the absence of Hantzsch ester 4 to access the switched reaction pathway. However, to our surprise,
under the optimized conditions for the synthesis of 6, the oxa-Michael-initiated cascade reaction between 1a and 2a did not take place at all (entry 1). Interestingly,
with benzoic acid (whose acidity is weaker than p-NBA) instead of p-NBA, the corresponding product 7a was obtained in 40% yield with high enantioselectivity
(entry 2). This suggests that basic additives may be beneficial to
the reactivity. As expected, the basic additives, such as NaOAc and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), increased
the rate of the cascade reaction (entries 3 and 4), which can be explained
by a possible deprotonative activation of the 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehyde 2a to form a more reactive intermediate with catalyst 3a. Not surprisingly, the cascade reaction proceeded smoothly
with only aminocatalyst 3a and neither acidic nor basic
additive was necessary (entry 5). On the other hand, after a brief
screening of the solvent, the use of chlorinated solvent (1,2-dichloroethane,
DCE) was found to be beneficial to the reaction rate (entry 6), whereas
maintaining the enantioselectivity and all other solvents, such as
MeCN, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and acetone, resulted in sluggish reactions
(entries 7–9), leading to very poor conversions even after
96 h. Finally, catalyst screening revealed that tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS)-protected diphenylprolinol catalyst 3b proved to be an effective catalyst without additives (entries
10 and 11), providing highly functionalized chromane product 7a in 71% yield with excellent stereoselectivity (97% enantiomeric
excess (ee), diastereomeric ratio > 20:1). Therefore, with regard
to enantioselectivity, the optimal conditions for the enantioselective
preparation of 7a were found to be the use of 3b as a catalyst in DCE at 25 °C.

Subsequently,
the substrate scope for the one-pot cascade sequence
was explored. As shown in Scheme 4, highly stereoselective reactions proceeded using
an array of 1-aza-1,3-butadienes 1 with electron-withdrawing
or electron-donating substituents on the aromatic ring at different
positions (7a–d). Excellent enantioselectivities
were also gained for 2-naphtyl-substituted 1 (7e). 2-Hydroxy cinnamaldehyde 2b bearing a fluoro substituent
on the aryl ring provided the desired product 7f in a
good yield and with excellent stereoselectivity. Additionally, the
analogous 1-azadiene 1′ containing the 1,2,3-benzoxathiazine-2,2-dioxide
motif was effectively applied in the cascade reaction process, leading
to 7g in good yield and stereocontrol.

Scheme 4 Substrate Scope of
Path b
To explore the utility of this
synthetic method, a larger-scale
synthesis of product 7a was performed under the standard
conditions (Scheme 5). To our delight, this larger-scale reaction (0.5 mmol) proceeded
smoothly to provide chromane product 7a containing an
aldehyde group and a ketimine moiety. As mentioned above, the remaining
ketimine moiety in the structure of 7a could be potentially
used for further transformations. The in situ Wittig reaction of 7a and ylide 8 generated enone 9, followed by the formation of an aminal fragment by the nucleophilic
attack of MeOH to the ketimine moiety, which facilitated a subsequent
intramolecular aza-Michael addition to give polyheterocyclic product 10 in good isolated yield (40% over three steps) and with
high structural and stereogenic complexity. It should be noted that
product 10 was obtained as a single diastereoisomer bearing
five stereocenters and one is a tetrasubstituted stereogenic center.

Scheme 5 Larger-Scale Synthesis and Useful Transformations
The absolute configuration of product 6a (CCDC 1873976)
and 10 (CCDC 1873974) was unequivocally determined by
X-ray crystallographic analysis (see Scheme 3 for 6a and Scheme 5 for 10; the H
atoms are omitted for clarity) and all other products were assigned
by analogy.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed two asymmetric
organocatalytic competitive
cascade reaction pathways: (1) 1-aza-1,3-butadienes were used as a
four-atom unit to react with 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehydes via a one-pot
[4 + 2] cycloaddition/iminium ion induced aminal formation cascade
sequence and (2) 1-aza-1,3-butadienes were used as a two-carbon unit
to react with 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehydes via an oxa-Michael/Michael
cascade sequence. The application of Hantzsch ester is proposed to
be the key to achieve the switch between these two different cascade
reaction pathways, providing polycyclic chromane-containing compounds
with high structural and stereogenic complexity. Finally, the designed
cascade sequence is amenable to a larger scale, with a negligible
difference in yield and stereoselectivity. Further functionalization
on the ketimine moiety of the products led to a more complex and diverse
polyheterocyclic compound.

are reported as follows: [α]D20 (c in g per 100 mL, solvent).
All reactions are carried out at the bench with commercial reagents
and solvent without further purification. Chiral HPLC analysis is
performed on a HITACHI Chromaster. Daicel Chiralpak IA, IB, and IC
columns with i-PrOH/n-hexane/CH2Cl2 as the eluent are used. HPLC traces were compared
to racemic samples prepared by a mixture of two enantiomeric final
products obtained using (S) and (R) catalysts.

the 2-hydroxy cinnamaldehydes 2 are synthesized from
the corresponding salicylaldehydes via the Wittig reaction.9 The substituted cyclic 1-azadienes 1 were prepared from 3-methylbenzo[d]isothiazole
1,1-dioxide and the corresponding aldehyde.4

General Procedure for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Polycyclic

A glass vial
equipped with a magnetic stirring bar was charged with 2 (0.12 mmol, 1.2 equiv), 3a (3.2 mg, 0.01 mmol), and p-NO2C6H4COOH (3.4 mg,
0.02 mmol) in acetone (0.1 mL) at 40 °C, and then Hantzsch ester 4 (30 mg, 0.12 mmol) and 1 (0.10 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
were added simultaneously. Reactions were carried out at 40 °C.
After 1 was consumed, p-TsOH (60 mg,
0.35 mmol) and additional acetone (0.1 mL) were added, and the reaction
mixture was then stirred at 25 °C for another 6 h. After the
reaction was completed, the product was purified by column chromatography
on silica gel using petroleum ether–ethyl acetate solvent mixture
as the eluent to provide the desired polycyclic chromane-containing
products 6.

A glass vial equipped with
a magnetic stirring bar was charged with 2 (0.10 mmol,
1.0 equiv), 3b (7.2 mg, 0.02 mmol) in CHCl3 (0.6 mL) at 25 °C, and then 1 (0.12 mmol, 1.2
