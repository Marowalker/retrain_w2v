The development of novel materials
capable of delivering multiple
growth factors is urgent and essential for rapid and effective tissue
regeneration. In this study, a kind of composite film composed of
poly-l-lysine (PLL), heparin (Hep), and Au nanoparitcles
(Au nps) has been fabricated to deliver the basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) simultaneously.
The films have been found to show enhanced mechanical property due
to the incorporation of Au nps. They have also shown good anticoagulation
activity with long activated partial thromboplastin time because of
the contribution of Hep molecules. Moreover, the osteogenesis studies
reveal that the loaded bFGF and BMP-2 in the composite films have
a synergistic differentiation effect on mesenchymal stem cells, as
indicated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and collagen
type I (Col-I) gene expression. In contrast to the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6 and (PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF films,
the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF films have shown higher ALP activity and higher Col-I
expression level. Therefore, the developed multifunctional films could
be potentially used as osteoinductive coatings of biomaterials. Particularly,
this simple and convenient strategy provides an effective approach
for the immobilization of multiple growth factors, which may be extended
to other bioactive systems for the development of novel multifunctional
bioactive surfaces.

Introduction
Growth factors refer
to naturally occurring proteins capable of
targeting specific cellular receptors and triggering various cellular
processes.1−3 They have generated numerous clinical trials and
are of great interest in regeneration medicine and tissue engineering.
However, there are still some challenges to the use of growth factors
such as high cost, easy denaturation, short biological half-life,
rapid local clearance by circulation, and potential side effects in
supra-physiological dosage.4−6 Therefore, many researchers have
focused on the investigation of localized delivery systems that can
offer the potential of concentrating them and of protecting them from
denaturation.7−9

Particularly, glycosaminoglycan-containing
biomaterials have become
an attractive delivery method for growth factors due to the specific
binding affinity between them. Among these glycosaminoglycans, heparin
(Hep), a negatively charged polysaccharide, is especially attractive
because of its high content of sulfate groups in the polymer chains. It
has been shown to have strong affinities for a class of growth factors,
such as the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial
growth factor, transforming growth factor β, and bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP).10 In addition to the localized
delivery of a single factor, simultaneous or sequential delivery of
multiple growth factors has also been studied for the enhancement
of therapeutic efficiency.11,12 However, embedding
Hep in delivery systems often leads to chemical or conformational
variation of the structure, resulting in a loss of the inherent activity
of Hep.13 Therefore, the development of
novel systems is highly required to efficiently encapsulate growth
factors as well as to minimize the loss of Hep activity. Layer-by-layer
(LbL) assembled systems could be potential candidates due to the fact
that a large variety of biological objects have been deposited without
denaturation, including lipids, proteins, bacteria, viruses, and so
on.14−17

In the last two decades, the LbL assembly has become a convenient
method for fabricating multilayer films, regardless of the dimension
and topography of the substrates. The method provides simplicity,
versatility, and nanoscale control, making it one of the most widely
used technologies for surface functionalization in many fields, especially
in cellular and tissue engineering.18−25

In this study, Hep was assembled by the LbL assembly technique
using poly-l-lysine (PLL), a positively charged polypeptide,
with simultaneous immobilization of bFGF and BMP-2. bFGF is a well-known
growth factor, which exerts stimulatory effects on the migration and
proliferation of various types of cells, such as vascular cells and
osteoblasts, and has been recognized as an important growth factor
in the process of bone fracture healing.26 BMP-2 is the most potent growth factor for bone regeneration by
stimulating the migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their
differentiation into osteoblasts.26 The
effects of the films delivering bFGF and BMP-2 dually and those delivering
bFGF or BMP-2 singly on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs were
evaluated via alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, ALP activity assay,
and collagen type I (Col-I) gene expression.

As a potential
candidate for applications in bone regeneration
and bone tissue engineering, the growth of thrombus must be suppressed
on the surface of Hep. Interestingly, besides immobilizing growth
factors, Hep could also inhibit the formation of thrombus. Hep is
an important anticoagulant in clinics for the treatment of venous
thromboembolism. It has an effect on inhibiting the activation of
prothrombin in normal plasma and preventing the thrombus formation
by catalytically accelerating the affinity of AT III to thrombin.27 The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)
tests, as the medical tests that characterize blood coagulation, were
performed on all heparined films in this study to evaluate their anticoagulation
properties.

Additionally, Au nanoparticles (Au nps) were incorporated
into
the PLL/Hep films to enhance the mechanical property of the pure polymer
films based on our previous reports that the mechanical properties
of polymer films could be enhanced by introducing high-strength nanomaterials
into the polymer matrix.28,29 Moreover, there has
been accumulating evidence that Au nps can facilitate stem cell therapy
and bone tissue engineering due to their distinct physicochemical
properties, excellent biocompatibility, facile synthesis, and easy
surface modification.30−33 In addition, considering that the mechanical strength is a concern
parameter regulating biological processes and even determining cell
fate,34−37 the mechanical properties of the polymer films and the composite
films were all measured by the nanoindentation technique and compared
in this study.

Thus, the functional assembled multilayer of
(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF (Figure 1) is anticipated
to inhibit thrombus formation, enhance mechanical properties and promote
osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Au nps
The Au
nps were fabricated
with citrate reduction, which has become a model system. The particles
obtained by this method were always well dispersed and the size of
the particles could be controlled by adjusting the Na3C6H5O7/HAuCl4 ratio.38,39 From the TEM images (Figure S1A), the
obtained monodispersed Au nps were estimated to have a diameter of
17 nm. The UV–vis peak at 522 nm is shown in Figure S1B, where the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) indicated
particle sizes between 15 and 20 nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
measurements confirmed that the average diameter of Au nps was about
18 nm (Figure S1C). These results were
consistent with each other. Additionally, the zeta potential of the
Au nps was determined to be −31.5 mV, which is convenient for
the subsequent assembly with positively charged species.

Characterization
of Au np-Based Multilayer Films
The
negatively charged Au nps were assembled with PLL, the positively
charged polypeptide, using the LbL assembly technique. Firstly, the
(PLL/Au nps)2 films were assembled onto silicon wafers
for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Chemical element
composition of the films could be reflected from the XPS spectrum.
According to the scienta ESCA 300 database,40 the peaks of Au 4f at 87.7 eV and N 1s at 400 eV in Figure 2A confirmed that Au nps and
PLL were assembled onto the silicon wafer successfully. However, the
peak at 152 eV for Si 2s implied that the (PLL/Au nps)2 film had not covered the whole silicon wafer surface. Thus, the
two-bilayer film was not enough to form a coherent coating, showing
the necessity to build films with more layers. The construction of
the PLL/Au nps films with different bilayers, from one to six bilayers,
was monitored by the UV–vis spectra, as shown in Figure 2B. In contrast to bare Au nps,
redshifts of SPR of Au nps in the films were obvious for one bilayer,
two bilayers, and three bilayers, from 521 to 595, 644, and 663, respectively.
The shift almost vanished
from three bilayers until six bilayers. According to the study of
the Tsukruk group,41 the redshifts might
be caused by interparticle resonances, which could be decided by the
distance/diameter ratio of Au nps in the films. Furthermore, both
the surface morphology of the (PLL/Au nps)6 and the (PLL/Hep)6 ultrathin films could be observed with the atomic force microscopy
(AFM) technique (Figure 2C,D). In total, 5 × 5 μm2 images of the layers
of interest were collected and recorded. Obviously, Au nps were deposited
by forming a nanostructured surface with some aggregates of nanoparticles
on it, as in Figure 2C. Compared to the pure polymer films (PLL/Hep)6, the
nanostructured surface exhibited a roughness of 22.87 nm (Rms), whereas
the former showed a roughness of 3.70 nm (Rms).

(PLL/Au nps)2 films. (B) UV–vis
spectra of the PLL/Au nps films with different bilayers, with one
to six bilayers shown from bottom to top. AFM images of (C) the (PLL/Au
nps)6 film and (D) the (PLL/Hep)6 film.

Here, Au nps were incorporated
into the films to obtain films with
excellent mechanical properties. The mechanical property of the developed
PLL/Au np films together with PLL/Hep films was determined by the
TriboIndenter nanomechanical test technique. The technique allows
a direct measurement of the mechanical properties of films. A maximum
load of 12 μN was applied on the films, and to avoid substrate
effects, the depth of indentation was kept below 20% of the film thickness.
Considering this, 180
bilayers of the films were prepared for mechanical measurements. The
obtained load–displacement (P–h) curves of both [(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6]10 films and (PLL/Hep)180 films are shown in Figure 3A. From the figure, a change in the unloading gradient
between two kinds of films could be clearly observed. This indicated
an increase in the reduced elastic modulus (Er) from PLL/Hep films to PLL/Au nps films, which could be calculated
to be 7.81 ± 0.82 GPa for the PLL/Au nps films and 0.18 ±
0.07 GPa for the PLL/Hep films with the Oliver–Pharr model
(Figure 3B). Likewise,
the maximum indentation depth (hmax) of
the composite films is shorter than that of the pure films, indicating
that the films are harder to penetrate than the latter under the same
indentation load. The hardness (H) of the films is
also shown in Figure 3B, that is,145 ± 16 MPa for the nanocomposite films and 6.8
± 1.95 MPa for the pure polymer films. Actually, the values of Er and H vary according to the
measurement method and physical model, so the values here are the
comparative ones based on the nanoindentation technique and the Oliver–Pharr
model, but still, these results could serve as the evidence that the
mechanical properties of the polymer films were enhanced substantially
by incorporation of Au nps. It has been found that human MSCs could
be directed along neuronal, muscle, or bone lineages by changing the
stiffness of the substrate.35 For example,
Discher et al. have reported that soft matrices that mimic brain could
induce neurogenic differentiation of hMSCs, stiffer matrices that
mimic muscle were myogenic, and comparatively rigid matrices that
mimic collagenous bone induced osteogenic differentiation.36 Accordingly, the comparatively rigid Au np-based
films could have the potential to induce osteogenic differentiation
of MSCs.

technique. (B) Values of the reduced elastic modulus (Er) and hardness (H) of the composite

(SD).

Loading and Releasing of
Growth Factors
On the surface
of the (PLL/Hep)6 films, BMP-2 and bFGF bind with the Hep
molecules. The binding affinity and process were investigated with
a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) using the third overtone (Figure 4). With the QCM technique,
mass changes could be reflected from the resonant frequency shifts
when interaction occurs on the surface of the electrode. In Figure 4A, a significant
decrease in frequency is observed upon the exposure of the (PLL/Hep)6 films to BMP-2 solution, meaning a strong binding of the
films with BMP-2. Then the frequency decreased slowly with increasing
interaction time and became stable after 3 h of interaction. A similar
tendency for the bFGF immobilization could be observed in the (PLL/Hep)6 films (Figure 4B). The subsequent washing step with PBS did not bring about any
significant frequency increase, which means the strong immobilization
of growth factors on the film. Therefore, the as-developed films could
immobilize and load multiple growth factors simultaneously and efficiently.
In the case of BMP-2 immobilization (Figure 4A), the subsequent deposition of PLL and
Au nps was also monitored with QCM. Obviously, further upper layer
assembly caused new frequency decreases, thus indicating continuous
assembly on the former film.

Figure 4 (A) QCM curves showing changes in frequency
during the interaction
of the (PLL/Hep)6 films with BMP-2 in PBS (200 ng/mL) and
the subsequent steps, including the washing process with PBS and the
deposition of PLL and Au nps; (B) that of (PLL/Hep)6 with
bFGF solution (200 ng/mL) and the washing process with PBS.

We further examined the dynamics
of bFGF and BMP-2 released from
(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF and (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, respectively. The release profiles are listed in Figure 5. It could be seen
that both systems showed sustained release of the growth factors over
an incubation period of 21 days. These release behaviors are decided
mainly by the interactions between the growth factors and Hep molecules
in the films, which delayed their diffusion into the incubation media.
Compared with the release of bFGF, that of BMP-2 seemed much slower
during the entire process. After the incubation of 21 days, nearly
about 70% of the loaded bFGF and 40% of that of BMP-2 were released.
It might be assumed that the dual physical blocking contributed by
Au nps and the macromolecule multilayer film limited the diffusion
of BMP-2.

(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, respectively. The error bars are all SD.

Anticoagulation Properties of the Heparined Multilayers
The in vitro anticoagulation properties of the materials were commonly
evaluated using an APTT assay. The APTT values of the poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) sheet, PLA-(PLL/Hep)18, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, and (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF
and that of the untreated platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as a control
were all recorded and are compared in Figure 6A. There was little difference between the
PLA sheet and PRP, with a value of 27.7 ± 1.7 s, a normal coagulation
time. However, the values of all of the heparined surfaces were prolonged
to be 41.1 ± 1.9 s for PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, 77.3 ± 2.9 and 81.1
± 2.4 s for PLA-(PLL/Hep)18 and PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, respectively.
These results could be attributed to the contribution of Hep molecules.
Moreover, compared with the other heparined surfaces, the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF
surface had a shorter coagulation time, which might be due to the
blocking of growth factors immobilized in the films. In fact, the
decreased anticoagulation activity is more desirable because of some
excessive bleeding side effects from very high anticoagulation activity.42 Additionally, the surface morphology images
of (PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6 and (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF were recorded with AFM (Figure 6B,C). There was a slight difference in the
surface roughness between them, 3.29 nm for the former and 1.33 nm
for the latter.

Cytotoxicity Assay of the Developed Nonallanocomposite Films
Rat bone marrow derived MSCs were cultured on all of the studied
surfaces, including tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), PLA sheets,
PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, and PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF. Phase-contrast images of all
of these MSCs cultured for 3 days were obtained using an Olympus microscope
(Figure 7A). The MSCs
were found to spread on the surfaces, exhibiting a shuttle-shaped
appearance in a whirlpool manner. They were polygonal and flattened
with the elongated structure with their spindle-like shape. These
results suggested that the developed surfaces had not hampered normal
growth of the cells. On the other hand, cell viability was investigated
by CCK-8 assay when the cells were cultured in normal cell medium
on all of the studied surfaces (Figure 7B) at days 1, 7, 14, and 21. It could be seen that
there was no significant difference in cell survival and proliferation
between the developed surfaces and the controls (Figure S2), which indicated that the developed films had low
cytotoxicity and were promising for applications in cellular and tissue
engineering.

bars are all SD.

Osteogenic Differentiation
of MSCs on the Developed Nanocomposite
Films’
ALP Activity
MSCs
have multiple differentiation capacity and could be induced osteogenic
differentiation by specific growth factors. ALP activity is generally
used as an early-stage marker of osteogenic differentiation. ALP staining
and ALP activity assay were performed simultaneously to investigate
the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs on all of the studied surfaces,
including TCPS, PLA sheets, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, and PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF.
Significantly enhanced ALP activity produced from MSCs on PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF
could be observed both in the ALP staining (Figure 8A) and in the quantitative assay (Figure 8B). In Figure 8A, dark-blue staining in the
cells cultured on PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF was more intense than those cultured
on PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6 and PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF. This was consistent with the quantitative results of
ALP activity, as shown in Figure 8B. ALP activity for all of the cells increased significantly
from days 3 to 14. The cells cultured on the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF films
showed higher ALP activity than those on the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6 and (PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF films.
These results provided the evidence of the synergistic effect between
BMP-2 and bFGF in the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF films.

PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF and negative control for 14 days. The scale bars are

7, 10, and 14 days. The error bars are all SD.

Col-I Gene Expression during Osteoinducive Differentiation
Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs would lead to increased expression
of several osteogenic lineage genes, especially Col-I. The expression
of Col-I gene was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) for cells cultured on all studied surfaces at days 3, 7,
14, and 21 of differentiation induction (Figure 9). The results were presented as the ratio
of Col-I to GADPH for each system, with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the internal control. The mRNA expression
levels of Col-I for all of the induced groups increased steadily from
day 3, reached the highest at day 7 or 4, followed by significant
decrease till day 21. The cells on the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF films had the highest
Col-I expression at day 14 among all of the studied surfaces, including
that of (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6 and (PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF (Figures 9 and S3). The data suggested that the
co-immobilized growth factors by the heparined nanocomposite films
had synergistically enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.
The synergistic effect of the immobilized BMP-2 and bFGF might be
achieved by the mutual regulation of signaling pathways.43

Conclusions
In this study, Hep/Au
nanocomposite films were constructed to deliver
BMP-2 and bFGF dually for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. The
developed nanocomposite films were characterized separately by UV–vis
spectroscopy, XPS analysis, AFM, QCM, and the nanoindentation technique.
The cell viability of MSCs on the developed films was evaluated, including
PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, and PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, and they all showed low cytotoxicity,
which implied that the films were suitable for the investigation of
their potential applications in cellular and tissue engineering. During
the process of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF
films presented good osteoinductivity with the highest ALP activity
and Col-I gene expression, compared with (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6 and (PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, showing the synergistic
effect of both growth factors. Therefore, the heparined film for the
synergistic delivery of multiple growth factors is an efficient system.
Importantly, this kind of films may serve as potential osteoinductive
coatings for biomedical scaffolds in bone tissue engineering. Additionally,
the strategy can be extended to immobilize other growth factors according
to requirements, thus opening an effective way to develop novel types
of biomedical surfaces.

Experimental Section
Materials
Polyethyleneimine
solution (PEI, ∼50%
in H2O), poly-l-lysine hydrobromide (PLL, MW:
30 000–70 000), Hep ammonium salt from porcine
intestinal mucosa (17–19 kDa), and bovine serum albumin were
all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). FGF Basic Recombinant Human
Protein and BMP-2 Recombinant Human Protein were obtained from Gibco.
Chloroauric acid trihydrate (HAuCl4·4H2O, 99.9%) was purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm (China). Trisodium
citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O) was obtained from Tianjin Kaitong chemical
reagent co., Ltd (China). APTT kits were purchased from MACCURA, China.
PLA sheets with a thickness of 100 μm were purchased from the
Institute of Medical Devices of Shandong Province (China). All of
the chemical reagents were used as received without further purification.
The water used in this work was purified using a Millipore Milli-Q
system.

Preparation of Au nps
Au nps were prepared by the classical
chemical reduction method, namely, citrate-induced reduction of aqueous
Au3+.44,45 That is, in nearly boiling water,
the reductant Na3C6H5O7·2H2O reduced Au3+ to Au directly. A typical
reaction was performed as follows: 40 mL of 0.25 mM HAuCl4 solution was heated to 95–100 °C, and then 2 mL of 5
mg/mL preheated citrate was added dropwise to it under agitation.
When the color of the solution changed slightly from yellow to wine
red, the Au np dispersion was boiled for another 30 min, followed
by cooling to room temperature before centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10
min). During the preparation, the glassware used was drastically cleaned
with aqua regia and water, and then oven-dried at 110 °C for
2 h.

Fabrication of Composite Multilayer Films
Silicon,
quartz wafer, PLA sheet, and QCM electrode were used as the substrates
during the LbL assembly for different characterization. Here, PLA
sheets were used as the substrates due to the fact that the PLA-based
medical implants had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
for direct contact with biological fluids and had been applied widely
in tissue engineering in the form of anchors, screws, plates, pins,
rods, and so on. Silicon, quartz wafer, and the gold electrode of
QCM were treated by Piranha solution (98% H2SO4:30% H2O2 = 7:3, v/v) before use. To make the
assembly efficiently, PEI was the first layer on the substrates. PLA
sheets were treated with poly-(allylamine hydrochloride) to make the
surface positively charged. Then,
the corresponding substrates were dipped alternatively in Hep solution
(2 mg/mL in 0.15 M NaCl) and PLL solution (2 mg/mL in 0.15 M NaCl),
for 20 min for each by washing three times each time until 6-bilayer
(PLL/Hep)6 coatings were obtained. Continuously,
the obtained (PLL/Hep)6 surface was used as the new substrate,
onto which (PLL/Au nps)6 was deposited in the same way
subsequently. Finally, another (PLL/Hep)6 multilayer was
deposited as the outermost surface.

Growth Factor Loading and
Release
First, the BMP-2
solution (200 ng/mL in PBS) was dropped onto the film (PLL/Hep)6 being incubated for 6 h to be loaded onto the film, and then,
(PLL/Au nps)6 was deposited further up. Finally, bFGF was
loaded onto (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6 similarly. In such a way, the (PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF films were obtained and
recorded as (P/H)6/BMP-2/(P/A)6/(P/H)6/bFGF for short.

The loading process of the films with growth
factors was monitored using the QCM technique (Q-Sense E4, Biolin
Scientific, Sweden). The QCM gold electrode (14 mm in diameter) was
treated with Piranha solution, following by chemical absorption of
negatively charged 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate sodium (Sigma-Aldrich).
The charged gold electrode with PEI as the first layer served as the
substrate for the construction of films (PLL/Hep)6. The
as-developed films were incubated with growth factor solution (200
ng/mL in PBS) at a flow rate of 50 μL/min continuously until
the equilibrium. During the process, the shifts in frequency were
continuously recorded.

The released amount of growth factors
from these films was determined
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for BMP-2 and bFGF (Thermo
Scientific).

APTT Tests
APTT was used to determine
the anticoagulation
properties of PLL/Hep multilayers. Here, fresh blood taken from a
health volunteer was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min to obtain
PRP for the anticoagulation test. The samples were immersed in 350
μL PRP and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then 300 μL
of the treated PRP were moved and mixed with 2.5 mL APTT reagent in
the given storage tanks, similarly for that untreated PRP. Subsequently,
thrombus formation was detected automatically by a change in the turbidity
of the solution, and the coagulation times were determined using a
Sysmex CA-1500 instrument (SIEMENS, Germany).

Characterization of Au
nps and Au np-Based Composite Films
Au nps were characterized
using a H-7500 transmission electron
microscope (TEM, Hitachi, Japan) and a UV-3600 UV–Vis spectroscope
(Shimadzu, Japan). The zeta potential of gold nanoparticles was evaluated
using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS analyzer (Malvern, U.K.). The assembled
films were analyzed through XPS ESCAlab 220i-XL (VG, U.K.) with Al
Kα radiation at an angle of 54.7° under a pressure of 109 mbar. The surface topography and roughness of the multilayer
films in the dry state were observed and analyzed using a Nanoscope
IIIa AFM (Digital Instrument) in the tapping mode using OPUS tips,
a standard tapping mode AFM probe (NANOANDMORE, Germany). Nanomechanical
tests were carried out with a commercial nanoindenter TS 75 (Hysitron
Inc.) using a cube-corner indenter tip with a radius of 40–50
nm. This is a load-controlled and displacement-sensing device. The
measurement was performed at 20–25 °C and under a humidity
of about 30%, as previously reported.46 The obtained load–displacement curve was utilized to calculate
the reductive elastic modulus (Er) and
hardness (H) of the film samples with the method
of Oliver and Pharr.47 The Er and H could be derived from the following
equations. 1   2   3   4  S is the slope of the unloading
curve at the maximum penetration depth hmax.

Cell Culture
MSCs derived from rat bone marrow were
purchased from Tianjin Weikai Bioeng Ltd. (China) and cultured under
5% CO2 at 37 °C with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells at passage 4 were
used in the experiments. For comparison, the cells were seeded onto
different surfaces, including TCPS, PLA sheets, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, and
PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF.

Cell Viability
For cell viability,
the cells with a
density of 3.0 × 104 cells/well were seeded onto the
above surfaces, that is, TCPS, PLA, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au
nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, and PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF.
Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays (Dojindo, Japan) were carried out
for all of the cells at days 1, 7, 14 and 21. The morphology of the
MSCs on different surfaces was obtained using an inverted phase-contrast
microscope (Olympus CKX31, Japan) at day 3.

ALP Staining and Activity
Assay
The MSCs were seeded
onto the studied and control surfaces, including TCPS, PLA, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, and
PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well
in 24-well plates. After 24 h, osteogenesis was induced by replacing
the original medium with osteogenic medium containing 10 mM β-glycerol
phosphate, 10–8 M dexamethasone, and 0.2 mM ascorbic
acid, which would be changed every 3 days up to confluence (21 days).
ALP staining was performed using BCIP/NBT stock solution (Beyotime,
China) at day 14 and ALP activity assay was carried out by using the
protocol from the ALP assay kit (abcam, Hong Kong) at days 3, 7, 10,
and 14.

Quantitative RT-PCR
In six-well plates, the MSCs were
seeded onto the studied and control surfaces, including TCPS, PLA,
PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6, PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF, and PLA-(PLL/Hep)6/BMP-2/(PLL/Au nps)6/(PLL/Hep)6/bFGF at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well. At days 3, 7, 14, and 21, the cells were washed
and collected, for RNA extraction using Trizol reagents (Invitrogen).
The RNA concentrations were assessed at 260 nm with a spectrophotometer
from Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The expression of Col-I
gene was measured by RT-PCR performance using FastQuant RT Kit (TIANGEN,
China) and SuperRealPreMix Plus (TIANGEN, China) on a LightCycler
480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Switzerland). The gene expression
normalized to GAPDH was expressed and used.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were repeated
at least three times with the data presented as mean ± SD. Statistical
analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and the comparison was made by Tukey’s method post hoc test.
The differences *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 among all samples or between samples and controls were
considered statistically significant.
