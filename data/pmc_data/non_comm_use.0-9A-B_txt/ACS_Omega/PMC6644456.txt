The
well-known difficulty to obtain high-quality protein crystals
has motivated researchers to come up with new methods or modifications
of established crystallization methods to stimulate the growth of
good diffracting crystals. In the present work, a new approach, using
a protein thin film organized by external electric field (EEF) as
a template for protein crystal growth, is introduced. This method
increased nucleation of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) in comparison
with the classical vapor diffusion method, besides improving crystal
morphology and size. X-ray diffraction analyses indicated improvements
in crystal quality. When HEWL was crystallized at pH 6.2, in which
this protein presents biological activity, the control crystal presented
a poorly ordered crystalline structure and a low resolution cutoff
at 3.42 Å, whereas the crystal grown with the EEF protein film
revealed a high-resolution limit at 1.67 Å. These results suggest
that protein films organized by EEF may improve protein crystals and
their data quality.

1 Introduction
Protein
crystallization is a process that requires specific conditions,
involving a transition phase in which protein molecules are no longer
soluble and form an organized core.1 In
this process, the limiting step is the nucleation,2 which requires not only a supersaturated solution but also
an ordered clustering between protein molecules to initiate crystal
growth.3 In some cases, it is possible
to reduce the energy barrier for nucleation by the creation of a microenvironment
that favors a higher local concentration of macromolecules.4

One of the methods used to reduce this
energy barrier is heterogeneous
nucleation.2 In this method, nuclei are
formed on suspended solid particles or surfaces in contact with the
solution. These supports can facilitate the nucleation process by
attracting the molecules electrostatically, hydrophobically, or through
specific interactions, which enables it to occur in metastable conditions.1

There are several works in the literature that apply heterogeneous nucleation, using distinctive
materials as support, such as polymeric films,5 rat whiskers and horse hair,4 bioactive
gel–glass particles,2 micromica
and natural chlorite,6 self-assembled monolayers,7,8 and porous and nonporous
microspheres.9 In the majority of these
works, an increase in the crystallization rate, an increase in the
size and number of crystals formed, and the formation of crystals
even under unfavorable conditions could be observed. However, different
nucleating materials can affect differently the quality of the crystal
formed because of incompatibilities between their crystal lattices.
Occasionally, the binding of crystals to the nucleating agents can
also hinder the harvest of single crystals for X-ray diffraction analyses.
Thus, these methods still present limitations, especially with regard
to the quality of the crystals formed.

An alternative to promote
nucleation and to obtain quality crystals
would be to use the protein itself as nucleating centers. In some
techniques, small crystals of the protein are used to seed the crystallizing
medium and to promote the growth of larger crystals.10 Nevertheless, dissolution of the seed crystals in medium
may happen, and there is the need to produce new seed crystals for
each new experiment.

Another way of promoting nucleation and
crystal growth is described
in works with protein thin films.11−14 In these studies, protein thin
films are formed by the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique, in
which the protein solution is applied in a water–air interface
followed by immediate submission to high pressure and then transferred
to a glass slide. On this film, a small drop of protein solution is
applied and the slide is reversed on the crystallization plate, as
in the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method. With this technique, it
was possible to obtain microcrystals of two proteins that, until then,
had not been crystallized: bovine cytochrome P450scc and human kinase
CKII.12 In further works with lysozyme,
thaumatin, ribonuclease A and proteinase K analyses revealed that
the crystals generated with LB films were larger (about three times)
than the crystals without films, using the same solutions, and presented
the same resolution (1.6 Å) under X-ray diffraction analyses.15

At evaluating the effects of synchrotron
radiation on crystals
formed of LB films, they were found to be more organized, more stable
under radiation and with better diffraction limits13 (when compared with crystals obtained by the classical
method), allowing the collection of higher quality data. Moreover,
at comparing the electron density maps, structural differences between
the models obtained with LB crystals and classic crystals were observed.
Despite the unique characteristics of LB crystals, some difficulties
persist when the method is used for determining the structures of
some proteins, especially membrane proteins.

The application
of an external electric field (EEF) in the crystallization
solution has been extensively studied by several researchers.16−21 The electric field would have two main effects on a supersaturated
solution: molecular orientation and density fluctuation.22 Density fluctuation occurs mainly due to the
electromigration, which leads to an increase in local concentration,23 whereas the molecular orientation is a result
of the molecular polarization because the electric field creates an
oriented dipole, leading to a preferential crystal orientation.24 The effects of electromigration and molecular
orientation caused by an electric field from an alternating current
were observed in experiments with lysozyme in solution,18 in which a concentration gradient was established
and led to the formation of crystals near the cathode. The EEF application
during crystal growth can also improve the crystal quality and extend
the resolution, through the increase of the level of crystal internal
organization, as verified in another study with lysozyme.20

The use of an EEF during protein thin
film formation was first
described in a study with GlnB from Herbaspirillum
seropedicae.25 When the
electric field was applied, the protein molecules were clearly oriented,
as observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images.25 Thus, it is expected that the films formed by the electric
field have the potential to act as nucleation centers, which is the
starting point for the development of the method proposed in this
work.

Therefore, this work attempts to combine the pH variation
and the
application of an EEF to form an organized protein thin film, which
was used as a nucleation center for protein crystallization. The structure
of proteins films were analyzed by AFM and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), and the quality of the crystals was evaluated
by X-ray diffraction. We showed that protein thin films organized
by EEF can contribute as a nucleation center to protein crystallization.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Atomic Force Microscopy
The lysozyme
films formed by drop deposition on siliconized glass slides created
clusters, as previously reported in studies of lysozyme adsorption
onto mica.26−28 Kim et al. (2002) observed the formation of protein
particles on mica surface with a height of 2.5 nm and lateral dimensions
in the range 10–25 nm, which correspond to a monolayer of lysozyme
with approximately five protein molecules per cluster.

In our
study, we observed the formation of larger clusters, with sizes that
vary according to the pH conditions. In sodium acetate buffer (pH
4.5), mainly supramolecular structures with (60 ± 20) nm (Figure 1a,b) were formed,
whereas in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), larger structures averaging
(500 ± 120) nm (Figure 1d,e) were observed. Yet, in (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid) (MES) buffer (pH 6.2) and in (tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane
hydrochloride) (Tris-HCl) buffer (pH 8.0), clusters with (150 ±
50) and (250 ± 50) nm of lateral size (Figure 2a,b,d,e) were present. Because lysozyme presents
an ellipsoidal form with dimensions of 3.0 × 3.0 × 4.5 nm,29 the clusters observed can gather tens to hundreds
of molecules. Although the protein concentration (1.43 μg·mL–1) used was sufficient for a monolayer deposition,
the protein diffusion on the surface generated aggregates with one
or more protein layers (4–40 nm high).

and (f) only phosphate buffer solution exposed to EEF. The direction
of the applied EEF is from left to right.

solution without EEF application, and (f) only Tris-HCl buffer solution
exposed to EEF. The direction of the applied EEF is from left to right.

The application of an EEF during
film formation strongly suggests
a different distribution of supramolecular structures on the surface,
when this is compared to the drop deposition films. As previously
reported in a study with GlnB-Hs films,25 the presence of the electric field improves the organization of
structures on protein thin films. In sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5)
and in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), a slight orientation of clusters
is seen (Figure 1a,d),
at 30° and 50° relative to the direction of electric field
application, respectively. Nevertheless, in MES (pH 6.2) and Tris-HCl
buffers (pH 8.0), a very clear orientation at around 130° and
110° (relative to EEF) can be observed (Figure 2a,d), respectively.

On the other hand,
the drop deposition films presented a sparse
distribution of supramolecular structures throughout the surface,
leading to the formation of large clusters (Figure 1b,e) or having better area coverage (Figure 2b,e).

Once
the buffer compounds form similar structures in drop deposition
films,25,30 AFM images have been taken from thin films
formed by buffer solution exposed to EEF. These images showed no evidence
of orientation and a random distribution of buffer compounds (Figures 1c,f and 2c,f), similar to the pattern seen in the drop deposition
protein films. Thus, the orientation would be related to the presence
of large polar molecules, such as proteins,25 but not to buffer components. Despite this, the buffer composition
directly interferes in the distribution profile of structures on protein
thin films, when exposed to electric field, as can be seen in Figures 1a,d and 2a,d.

2.2 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
The final averaged FTIR spectrum of lysozyme
films for each buffer
condition is shown in Figure S1. Although
a spectrum range between 600 and 4000 cm–1 was used
in the measurements, the amide I band, from 1600 to 1700 cm–1, was used to analyze the results. This band corresponds to the vibration
mode mostly used in studies of protein secondary structure and originates
mainly from C=O stretching of the amide group.31 The Gaussian peak fitting procedure has been applied to
the averaged FTIR spectra (OriginPro 8 software). To optimize the
fit, eight Gaussian curves were used for spectral deconvolution. The
quality of the fitting was evaluated on the basis of χ2 values (on the order of 10–7) and correlation
coefficient values (≥0.999).

Hen egg white lysozyme structure
is composed of six α-helices and three β-sheets connected
by few flexible loops.28 In solution, lysozyme
exhibits an amide I maximum at 1654 cm–1, typical
of a protein with predominant α-helix secondary structure, and
minor absorptions at 1630 and 1673 cm–1 (corresponding
to extended chains like in the β-sheet structure), 1641 cm–1 (unordered structures), and 1666 and 1682 cm–1 (turns and bends).32 However,
as hydrated film on an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) plate, lysozyme
presents different frequency absorption, the maxima at 1646 and 1654
cm–1 (α-helix), 1630 cm–1 (β-sheet), and minor frequency absorptions at 1638 and 1662
cm–1 (random coil), and 1670 and 1678 cm–1 (β-turns).33

Comparing the
FTIR spectra of lysozyme films formed by drop deposition
(control) with the spectra of lysozyme films formed by EEF application,
it was possible to observe a shift in the α-helix frequency,
especially in the spectra of the protein in sodium acetate buffer
and in Tris-HCl buffer (Figure S1). In Table 1, the deconvolved
frequencies are summarized and it is possible to observe a shift from
1661 to 1657 cm–1, when the protein is in sodium
acetate buffer, and from 1659 to 1656 cm–1, when
the protein is in Tris-HCl buffer. This difference could be attributed
to structural rearrangements of the protein.31 The shift in the α-helix frequency was also observed in lysozyme
Langmuir–Schaefer films when treated at high temperatures,34 which is attributed to the stabilization of
the helical structure upon removal of water molecules. The difference
in the distribution of particles on the films may actually interfere
with water adsorption, which also leads to a difference in the signal
observed in the spectra of the control and the EEF films.

a According to Jackson & Mantsch
(1995).31

Concerning the β-sheet frequency, it was possible
to verify
a shift to a lower wavenumber in the spectra of the protein in MES
and in phosphate buffers, from 1639 to 1633 cm–1 and from 1640 to 1631 cm–1, respectively. Furthermore,
the region corresponding to antiparallel β-sheets or turns also
presents a shift in the peaks. While absorptions at 1682–1684
cm–1 can be assigned in control films, the EEF films
present absorptions at 1677–1680 and 1690–1694 cm–1. Once more, we can infer a structure reorganization
of the protein after EEF application.

2.3 Crystallization
under Different Conditions
The crystallization tests were
performed at three different pH
values: acid, employing sodium acetate (pH 4.5) as buffer, which is
the most widely used pH for lysozyme crystallization; alkaline, using
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) as buffer; and the pH of lysozyme biological activity
(pH 6.2), for which MES buffer was used.

In sodium acetate buffer,
as expected, there were no difficulties for crystal appearance in
a few days, even without the use of the protein film (Figure 3a,d). However, the use of the
EEF film as a template allowed the formation of a higher number of
crystals, clearly because of an increase in nucleation (Figure 3b,c). At conditions with lower
salt concentration, in which there was precipitation in the control
assays, the film allowed the growth of large and regular crystals.
In some cases, the use of the film retarded the emergence of crystals;
however, it contributed to the formation of larger and symmetrical
crystals (Figure 3e,f),
which can be important for improving data collected by X-ray diffraction.

Figure 3 Lysozyme
crystals obtained by the classical vapor-diffusion method
without the use of protein thin films (controls) (a,d,g,j,m,p) and
using EEF protein thin films in phosphate buffer (b,e,h,k,n,q), in
sodium acetate buffer (c,f), in MES buffer (i,l), and in Tris-HCl
buffer (o,r). Reservoir solution: sodium acetate buffer 50 mM (pH
4.5) with 780 mM NaCl (a–c) and 900 mM NaCl (d–f); MES
buffer 50 mM (pH 6.2) with 780 mM NaCl (g–i) and 1 M NaCl (j–l);
Tris-HCl buffer 50 mM (pH 8.0) with 1 M NaCl (m–o) and 900
mM NaCl (p–r). Drop solution: 1:1, lysozyme 10 mg·mL–1 (a–c,g–i,m–o) and 20 mg·mL–1 (d–f,j–l,p–r). It is one representative
experiment of three independent assays.

Nevertheless, at the pH condition in which the enzyme presents
biological activity (MES buffer, pH 6.2), the control tests required
more time (about 1 month) to crystallize, and moreover, only a few
small crystals were formed (Figure 3g). Only at higher protein concentration, larger crystals
could be obtained (Figure 3j). On the other hand, with the use of the EEF protein films,
the time for crystal emergence was reduced to 1 week. In addition,
nucleation was stimulated once again (Figure 3h,i), leading to the generation of several
medium-size crystals. Although the growth of larger crystals took
longer time (2–6 months), the method of EEF protein film produced
regular crystals (Figure 3k,l).

Under alkaline conditions (Tris-HCl buffer, pH
8.0), a large number
of small crystals appeared in the control tests, when lower protein
concentration was used (Figure 3m). When a higher protein concentration was employed, either
precipitation occurred (in some conditions) or crystals with an irregular
shape were formed (Figure 3p). In contrast, the EEF protein films enabled the growth
of larger and more symmetrical crystals (Figure 3q,r) in shorter time. Even at low protein
concentrations, when the nucleation is favored, crystals of medium
size were observed (Figure 3n,o).

The number of crystals obtained was significantly
higher in the
presence of protein thin film (p < 0.01) for acetate
and MES buffer.

In addition, tests were performed with standard
crystallization
solutions (Hampton Research Crystal Screens, HR2-110 and HR2-112).
Six solutions of different pH values from each crystallization kit
were chosen. In some conditions, crystal formation was observed only
when the EEF protein film was used as a template, namely, 100 mM imidazole
(pH 6.5) with 1 M sodium acetate; 100 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCl
and 1.6 M ammonium sulfate; and 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5)
with 200 mM magnesium acetate and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. In
other cases, such as in 100 mM MES (pH 6.5) with 200 mM ammonium sulfate
and 30% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000, it was possible
to observe an increase in the number of crystals formed.

Our
results agree with studies in which the usage of LB protein
thin films led to a positive influence in protein nucleation, with
an acceleration of crystal growth rate, in comparison with the classical
hanging drop method.11,12 In addition, the crystals obtained
with LB films are larger than those grown with the classical method,11,15 which was also observed in our study.

2.4 Diffraction
Quality Analyses of Lysozyme Crystals
The quality of lysozyme
crystals grown under different conditions
was analyzed by X-ray diffraction. For these experiments, crystals
with good morphology and similar sizes for each pH condition were
selected, such that more than one crystal from each situation was
used. Table 2 summarizes
the diffraction data statistics for crystals grown with and without
the use of EEF protein thin film as a template, obtained after data
processing with XDS and XSCALE.

In order to compare the quality
of crystals, three concomitant
criteria were used to determine the diffraction resolution limit:
global completeness ≥95%, ⟨I/σ(I)⟩ ≥ 1.0 and CC1/2 ≥ 50%
on the highest resolution shell. Recent studies have shown that, in
some cases, there is useful information remaining even when CC1/2 falls to around 40–20% and ⟨I/σ(I)⟩ to around 1.5–0.5,35 for model improvement. Despite being widely
used for determining the resolution cutoff, Rmeas or Rmerge values should play
no role to define the high-resolution limit because they can discard
many useful data.36,37

The diffraction analyses
indicated that crystals formed in sodium
acetate buffer without protein film presented the highest resolution
limit. This was already expected because it is the most widely used
condition for lysozyme crystallization. Nevertheless, the EEF crystal
obtained in phosphate buffer (crystal A2) also exhibited a good resolution
limit. The lower resolution limit presented by the EEF crystal in
sodium acetate buffer (crystal A1) could be related to the small conformational
changes observed by FTIR analyses, which affect the crystalline structure
and increase the crystal mosaicity, as can be seen in Table 2.

The lysozyme crystals
obtained using LB films at the same buffer
conditions were reported to show a high-resolution limit, at 1.57
Å, with ⟨I/σ(I)⟩ of 0.1 and completeness of 26.83%.14 Despite the fact that resolution cut-off criteria for LB crystals
were different from ours, we can say that our method propitiated also
a high-resolution for EEF crystals in phosphate buffer, at 1.68 Å,
with better diffraction quality ⟨I/σ(I)⟩ of 1.38 and completeness of 99.3%.

In alkaline
conditions, where Tris-HCl buffer was used for crystallization,
crystals obtained with EEF protein film demonstrated diffraction properties
similar to control crystal, despite presenting slightly lower resolution
limits. Interestingly, in this pH condition, the space group and the
unit cell dimensions are exactly the same for the crystal in sodium
acetate buffer. This fact may be related to the remarkable structural
stability of lysozyme in different pH conditions.38

On the other hand, when MES buffer (pH condition
of lysozyme biological
activity) was used, EEF protein films led to a dramatic improvement
in the diffraction properties of lysozyme crystals. The control crystal
showed a less ordered crystalline structure, partly because of high
mosaicity, resulting in lower diffraction power and resolution limit.
Compared to the control, the resolution limit increased from 3.42
to 1.67 Å (with EEF film in phosphate buffer). In contrast to
what occurred in sodium acetate buffer, the EEF protein film in MES
and in phosphate buffer has apparently improved the crystalline structure
of lysozyme crystals, allowing the better resolutions achieved by
X-ray diffraction.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, lysozyme crystallization was investigated using as
nucleation center a protein thin film obtained with the application
of an EEF. Different pH conditions were assayed, not only during the
protein film preparation but also in the crystallization tests. Regarding
to the lysozyme films, AFM images have suggested an orientation of
structures when EEF was applied, especially in the ones where MES
and Tris-HCl buffer were used. The FTIR spectra of lysozyme films
demonstrated some small frequency shifts, indicating possible structural
rearrangements of the protein in the EEF films.

Despite this,
the organized structure of the EEF protein film has
increased nucleation in all tested conditions, leading to the formation
of a larger number of crystals and, sometimes, also contributing to
the improvement of their size and/or morphology. Diffraction analyses
of the crystals grown with EEF protein films revealed a significant
improvement of the diffraction properties of the ones obtained at
pH 6.2, which corresponds to the biological activity of lysozyme.

The results suggest that the EEF protein films could be particularly
useful for the crystallization of proteins at lower initial concentration,
thus using small protein amounts and not requiring crystallization
kits to obtain crystals. Furthermore, this new approach opens possibilities
to study a protein structure in its physiological condition, which
may bring insights regarding its active structure. This method is
easily performed in any laboratory.

Further work is necessary
to understand the mechanisms of EEF protein
thin film influence in protein crystallization and nucleation. Of
remarkable importance, it would be to continue the investigation with
other protein models, in order to verify if these achievements are
reproducible.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Protein Solutions
The classic protein
crystallization model, with chicken egg white lysozyme (molecular
weight 14 300 Da, cat. no. 62970, Sigma-Aldrich Ltd.), was used
in our work. Lysozyme is a commercially available protein and has
been used as a standard for the development of new methods for protein
crystallization. The native protein solution was diluted to a final
concentration of 1.43 μg·mL–1 (100 nM)
in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 50 mM NaCl; in 50 mM MES (pH
6.2) and 50 mM NaCl; in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 50 mM
NaCl; and in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl, to be used for
the protein thin film preparation. For crystallization experiments,
the protein solution was diluted to 20 and 40 mg·mL–1 in purified water.

4.2 EEF Protein Thin Film Preparation
Each protein solution was dripped on siliconized cover slips (Hampton
Research HR 3-231, 22 mm) inside channels (5 mm × 3 mm) made
of silicon paste and conductive ink.25 Each
channel was filled with protein solution (20 μL), and then the
EEF (300 V, 5 min) was applied using a conventional electrophoresis
power supply. To determine the best conditions, the current was monitored
as described in Ferreira et al. (2015). The same protein solutions
were used as control, by simple drop deposition on siliconized cover
slips. In addition, solutions prepared with only buffer components
were dripped on channels and the same EEF was applied. The films were
dried at room temperature.

4.3 Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM (Shimadzu
SPM9500J3, Japan) was used to analyze the topology and phase of protein
thin films, as well as of the buffer solutions and controls. The images
were obtained in dynamic mode, with a scan rate of 1.3 Hz. A silicon
cantilever with a spring constant of 36 N/m and a radius tip of 10
nm (Nanosensors) was used. The scan direction was aligned with the
applied EEF. The measurements were performed at controlled temperature
(22 °C) and humidity (40–50%). In order to eliminate noise
and to correct the slope of piezoelectric, the images obtained were
treated with Shimadzu software. Three random regions of 10–1
μm were chosen in each sample, in order to increase the statistical
credibility of results and to describe accurately the structure of
the film.

4.4 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
In order to verify the structural integrity of the proteins in
the film, after the EEF application, FTIR spectroscopy in ATR mode
was used. Measurements were performed in a Bruker spectrometer (Vertex
70) with a ZnSe crystal, with the spectrum range between 600 and 4000
cm–1. All spectra corresponded to an average of
16 scans. The analyses were performed at controlled temperature (20
°C) and humidity (40%). Spectra of buffer solutions were also
obtained, to be compared to the spectra of the protein in the same
buffer solutions. After each measurement, the ZnSe crystal was washed
with ethanol 70% and Milli-Q ultrapure water. The final spectra are
the results of averages of samples in triplicates and measurements
in duplicates. All spectra were deconvolved and analyzed with OriginPro
8 software, to identify the position of the main peaks in each condition.

4.5 Crystallization
The protein thin
films organized with the EEF were used as templates for crystallization
tests. The siliconized cover slips were placed on polyvinyl chloride
rings, inside six-well tissue culture plates. With the purpose of
determining the composition of reservoir solutions, a classic sitting
drop test (without the use of protein thin film as a template) was
performed. In this test, sodium acetate buffer 50 mM (pH 4.5) with
NaCl (500 mM to 1000 mM) was used as the reservoir solution. For comparison,
the same conditions were used in crystallization tests with EEF protein
thin films. Because in both cases the best crystals were formed at
NaCl 780 mM, 900 mM and 1000 mM, these salt concentrations were also
employed in tests with other buffer solutions (at different pHs),
especially Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and MES buffer (pH 6.2). In each
condition, a classic sitting drop test, as well as assays using the
protein film with lysozyme in the same reservoir buffer and with lysozyme
in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), was performed, as described by Pechkova
& Nicolini11 (2001). The ratio between
the volumes of the crystallization drop and the reservoir solution
was 1:1000. The crystallization experiments were carried out at 20
°C. All the experiments were repeated three times.

4.6 Data Collection and Processing
X-ray
diffraction data were collected at MX2 beamline of the Brazilian National
Synchrotron Laboratory (Campinas, Brazil39). The collection was performed at 100 K, the wavelength was 1.4586
Å, and the image exposure times for datasets were between 0.8
and 2.4 s. At least 200 well-diffracting images were obtained for
each crystal using the PILATUS 2M detector. The crystal to detector
distance was 0.100 m in all cases. The cryoprotector used was either
10% glycerol or 15% ethylene glycol, diluted in reservoir solution.
The data were integrated, reduced, and scaled using XDS and XSCALE.
A summary of the data collection statistics is given in Table 2. Three sets of data were collected
for each experimental condition. Table 2 shows the best set of data obtained for each condition.
