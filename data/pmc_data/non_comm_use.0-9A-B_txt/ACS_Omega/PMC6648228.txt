For initiating a
prosperous cost-friendly waste management of small-scale
industries, cow buffing dust (CBD), one of the abundantly available
semisynthetic collagenic solid wastes, has been used as a nonsulfur
cross-linker of natural rubber (NR) for fabricating an NRCBD–biocomposite
superadsorbent. The as-prepared reusable biocomposite bearing variegated
collagenic and noncollagenic N-donors, along with the O-donors, has
been reported for ligand-selective preferential superadsorption from
waste water. Thus, a CBD and NR-based scalable biocomposite bearing
optimum cross-linking, excellent physicochemical properties, and reusability
has been developed via systematic optimization of the torque and reaction
time for cost-friendly adsorptive exclusion of dyes, such as 2,8-dimethyl-3,7-diamino-phenazine
(i.e., safranine, SF) and (7-amino-8-phenoxazin-3-ylidene)-diethylazanium
dichlorozinc dichloride (i.e., brilliant cresyl blue), BCB, and Hg(II).
The CBD-aided curing of NR has been achieved through the formation
of a cross-linked chromane-ring originated via reaction between the
methylol-phenol ring of phenol-formaldehyde resin and isoprene unit
of NR. The partial disappearance of unsaturation in cured-NRCBD, relative
variation of crystallinity, surface properties, elevated thermal stabilities,
and ligand-selective superadsorption have been studied by advanced
microstructural analyses of unadsorbed and/or adsorbed NRCBD using
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), 13C nuclear magnetic
resonance, ultraviolet–visible, and O 1s-/N 1s-/C 1s-/Hg 4f7/2,5/2-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, thermogravimetric
analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, field
emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy,
and pHPZC. Response surface methodology-based optimization
has been employed to attain the optimum potential of NRCBD, considering
the interactive effects between pHi, temperature, and concentration
of the dye. H-aggregate and time-dependent hypochromic effect has
been observed during individual adsorption of dyes. Moreover, the
prevalence of chemisorption via ionic interaction between NRCBD and
SF, BCB, and Hg(II) has been realized by FTIR, fitting of kinetics
data to the pseudosecond-order model, and measurement of activation
energies. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and Langmuir isotherms
fit the best to BCB and SF/Hg(II), respectively. Thermodynamically
spontaneous chemisorption have shown the maximum adsorption capacities
of 303.61, 46.14, and 166.46 mg g–1 for SF, BCB,
and Hg(II), respectively, at low initial concentration of Hg(II)/dyes
= 40 ppm, 303 K, and adsorbent dose = 0.01 g.

Introduction
Natural
rubber (NR) exhibits excellent elasticity, flexibility,
outstanding formability, biodegradability, resilience, and abrasion
resistance. NR is one of the most important elastomers in terms of
versatility and application volume. As uncured NR is sticky and inelastic,
NR is cured to make more durable cross-linked material.1,2 Theoretically, long chains of rubber molecules are cross-linked
by vulcanization to convert a plastic-like soft material into a strong
elastic product showing reversible deformability and good mechanical
properties because of strain-induced crystallization, low hysteresis,
excellent dynamic properties, and fatigue resistance. In addition
to the traditional sulfur-vulcanization, there are several nonsulfur
vulcanizing processes, which effectively produce diversified value-added
products.3,4

Leather production is associated with
the generation of a large
quantity of collagenic wastes, such as cow buffing dust (CBD), fleshings,
chrome shavings, and skin trimmings, of which CBD is generated during
the finishing operation. About, 2–6 kg CBD is generated as
the solid waste per ton of skin/hide processed. CBD causes respiratory
tract ailments, ulcers, perforated nasal septum, kidney malfunction,
and lung cancer. For the safe disposal of CBD, though the starved
air incineration is more acceptable than land disposal/thermal incineration,
the technique is not viable because of the severe air pollution. Therefore,
proper utilization of these hazardous wastes into valuable end products
should be of paramount importance. Earlier, CBD was used to prepare
activated charcoal of enhanced adsorption capacity (AC). Recently,
CBD has been utilized as the reinforcing filler in carboxyl-terminated-,5 carboxylated butadiene-acrylonitrile-, and butadiene-acrylonitrile-rubber6 for substantial improvement of mechanical properties
of composites. Alongside, CBD has been used as a binder in leather
boards bearing reasonably robust mechanical properties.7 However, the use of CBD and CBD-based materials
as a cross-linker of rubber and adsorbents of dyes and metal ions,
respectively, has not been reported till date.

CBD comprises
of collagen, oil, inorganic-/organic-tanning agent,
dyes, and fats. Thus, CBD contains different tanning agents, such
as chromium complexes, resoles, polyphenolic compounds of tannins,
and urea-formaldehyde, melamine-formaldehyde, and naphthalene-formaldehyde
sulfonic acid condensates. Of these, resoles and bisphenol-based phenol-formaldehyde
condensates are regularly used as synthetic tanning agents in leather,
and thus, CBD contains significant amounts of such molecules. Except
chromium complexes, most of the tanning agents, including bisphenol-based
phenol-formaldehyde condensates, reversibly bind with collagen via
H-bond and van der Waals interaction. Therefore, these reversibly
bound tanning agents can be reutilized in preparing some value-added
products, such as biocomposite superadsorbents for the removal of
water contaminants. Thus, bisphenol-based phenol-formaldehyde condensates
function as nonsulfur vulcanizing agent of NR, in which the vulcanization
mechanism preferably should follow the chromane mechanism instead
of the allyl hydrogen mechanism. Moreover, other type of reactions,
including Michelle’s addition, may also occur in between unsaturation
of NR and the primary amine of lysine side chain in CBD.

Chemical
industries, such as textile, cosmetics, leather, plastic,
paper, pharmaceutical, and food, use more than 10 000 types
of synthetic dyes and pigments.8 However,
a large amount of such aromatic dyes is released as waste effluents
causing serious pollution because of their carcinogenicity, teratogenicity,
and mutagenicity. Safranine (SF) is regularly used as a colorant of
natural fibers, such as wool, silk, and leather. Intrusion of SF in
the human body produces several harmful effects including carcinogenicity,
mitochondrial toxicity, and mutagenicity. Brilliant cresyl blue (BCB)
is used to determine oxalate, formaldehyde, nitrite, protein, hydrazine,
and cyclodextrin, and thus, a large amount of BCB is discharged to
the environment. Alongside, BCB acts as photocatalyst, photoconductor,
and fluorophore. BCB damages DNA through electrostatic attraction
and/or intercalation. According to the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, the maximum allowable limit of Hg(II) are 0.002
mg L–1 and 10 μg L–1 in
drinking and waste water, respectively. Thus, it is essential to eliminate
even trace amount of Hg(II) before discharging effluents into the
environment for human safety and environmental protection.9,10 All forms of mercury cause gastrointestinal disorder, neurologic
malfunction, renal problem, and impose detrimental effects on lungs,
kidneys, digestive system, brain, nervous system, endocrine system,
and reproductive system in human-being.11,12 Several methods,
such as chemical oxidation, ion-exchange, biological treatment, photocatalytic
degradation, adsorption,13−16 membrane based separation,17−19 precipitation,20 ion exchange,21 electro-deposition,22 complexation,23 electrostatic
attraction,24 and reverse osmosis,25 have been employed. Of these, adsorption is
the widely accepted promising method for water treatment because of
the ease of operation and maintenance, cost effectiveness, high efficiency,
flexibility, rapidness, simplicity of design, and availability of
diversified adsorbents.26 Alongside, response
surface methodology (RSM) is employed for the evaluation of relative
significance of several parameters in presence of complex interactions
for attaining the maximum AC.27−29

In this work, attempts
have been made to explore the vulcanizing
potential of CBD in preparing NRCBD adsorbents. Moreover, the associated
vulcanizing mechanism in the preparation of NRCBD-based adsorbents
are to be explored, and thereby the dual performance of CBD, both
as filler and vulcanizing agent, are to be investigated for efficient
removal of Hg(II), SF, and BCB from waste water.

Experimental Section
Materials
NaHCO3, Na2B4O7·10H2O, KCl, CH3COOH, CH3COONa, HCl, and
NaOH of analytical grades were purchased from
Merck. NR of grade ribbed smoked sheets 3 (RSS3) and CBD were collected
from PCBL (West Bengal, India) and local tannery (Bantala, Kolkata,
West Bengal, India), respectively. BCB, SF, and chloride salt of Hg(II)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Synthesis of Stable Biocomposite-Adsorbent
In order
to fabricate NRCBD, NR was selected as the matrix for carrying CBD
via chemical bond formation. Three CBD cross-linked NR-based biocomposite
adsorbents were fabricated by initial mastication of NR at 150 °C
for 1 min in a two-shaft internal roller mixer bearing 70 mL capacity,
wherein the mixing head was attached to a Brabender Plasticorder (CDD3000,
Germany), followed by the rapid addition of 25, 20, and 15 g CBD to
25, 30, and 35 g NR, respectively, in the next minute. In this regard,
as the mixing head is volume-sensitive, the loaded amount (i.e., 50
g) was restricted to 75% of mixer capacity. Thereafter, the mixing
process was continued in the internal mixer at 150 °C for another
18 min at 60 rpm. The recorded plastographs showing variation of torque
with time envisaged the curing characteristics encompassing the physical
changes because of heating and chemical cross-linking. It was observed
that all the plastographs consisted of several zones. Initially, a
sharp increase in torque was observed for all biocomposites within
the first 30 s because of the high viscosity of the inserted cold
material (Figure 1).
Thereafter, in the next 1 min, a zone of decreasing torque was manifested
in all biocomposites because of material softening on heating till
the attainment of the minimum torque. Subsequently, except NR/CBD
= 35/15, commencement of another zone was observed, wherein rapid
increase in torque was noted, and this particular zone was ascribed
to the onset and progress of cross-linking. Notably, an insufficient
amount of cross-links were formed in NR/CBD = 35/15 because of the
relatively lower extent of CBD. Accordingly, massive cross-linking
were originated in both NR/CBD = 30/20 and NR/CBD = 25/25.

Figure 1 Synthesis of
NRCBD–biocomposite adsorbent showing optimum
physicochemical properties.

Though the maximum torque attained by NR/CBD = 30/20 was
significantly
higher as compared to NR/CBD = 25/25, such an enhanced torque level
was gradually deteriorated, which indicated the relatively unstable,
that is, reversible nature of the cross-links, and thus, the NR/CBD
= 30/20 demonstrated reversion because of the cleavage of cross-links.
In contrast, a significantly enhanced torque was maintained consistently
in NR/CBD = 25/25, suggesting the formation of stable irreversible
cross-links. Therefore, NRCBD bearing NR/CBD = 25/25 was selected
as the most suitable and organized biocomposite-adsorbent.

Characterization
Unadsorbed and/or adsorbed NRCBD(s)
were characterized by the techniques as given in Table 1. Alongside, NRCBD was characterized
by pHPZC. RSM, all graphic-based analyses, and drawing
of chemical structures were carried out using Design-Expert 7.0.0,
Origin 9.0 software, and ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 software, respectively.

Methodology
Solutions
of HgCl2, SF, and
BCB were prepared by dissolving 5000 and 100 mg of HgCl2 and SF/BCB, respectively, into 1000 mL distilled water. Solutions
within 5–40 ppm were prepared by exact dilution of the stock
solutions. 0.01 g dry NRCBDs were added to buffer solutions containing
25 mL Hg(II), SF, and BCB for individual adsorption. Thereafter, 25
mL buffer solution of pHi = 7.0, 9.0, and 10.0 were added
to Hg(II), SF, and BCB, respectively, at 300 rpm. After predetermined
time intervals, the magnetic stirrer was stopped and the solution
was allowed to settle for a couple of min. The progress of adsorption
was monitored by withdrawing the supernatant solution, followed by
measuring absorbance (At) at the respective λmax to determine the residual
concentration (Ct, mg
L–1) of Hg(II) and dyes using atomic absorption
spectrometer (PerkinElmer AANALYST 100) and UV–vis spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer Lambda 365), respectively. From the precalibrated equation,
the Hg(II)/dye concentration (Ct) was calculated, from which AC (i.e., AC/qt, mg g–1) was determined
using eq 1. 1  Here, C0/Ct (ppm), V (mL), and ms (g) are feed Hg(II)/dye
concentrations at t = 0/t, volume
of adsorbate solution, and mass of NRCBD, respectively. After the
attainment of equilibrium, the residual concentration (Ce, mg L–1) was correlated with the equilibrium
AC (qe, mg g–1) using eq 1.

Results and Discussion
13C NMR Analyses
The 13C NMR
spectrum of NR constituted of sp3-C-specific peaks at 23.37,
26.36, and 32.17 ppm, which were attributed to −C(CH3)=CH–, −C(CH3)=CH–CH2–, and −CH2–C(CH3)=CH–, respectively (Figure 2a). In addition,
peaks at 124.99 and 135.16 ppm because of −C(CH3)=CH– and −C(CH3)=CH–, respectively, confirmed the presence
of unsaturation (i.e., sp2-C) in NR. CBD is composed of
collagenic and noncollagenic processing materials, such as methylol
urea (MU), 1,1-/1,3-dimethylol urea (DMU), and trimethylol urea (TMU)
of urea-formaldehyde resin and triazine of the melamine-formaldehyde
resin. In this context, characteristic peaks at 173.96 and 70.91 ppm
were attributed to >C=O of Gly/Pro/Hyp30 and Cγ of Hyp/–NHCH2OH of 1,1-DMU/–NH(CH2OH)2 of TMU/methylene diureas,31 respectively, whereas peaks within 151.68–157.25
ppm were ascribed to Cε of Arg32/>C=O of MU/1,3-DMU/1,1-DMU
(Figure 2b).31 Moreover, CBD-specific peaks at 59.62, 54.55,
49.56, 48.25, 30.40, 25.58, 20.15, and 17.65 ppm were attributed to Cα of Pro/Cα of Hyp, Cδ of Hyp/Cα of Glu/Cα of Asp/Cα of Lys, Cα of Ala, Cδ of Pro, Cδ of Lys/Cβ of Glu, Cγ of Lys, Cγ of Pro, and Cβ of Ala, respectively.30,32 The aromatic ring carbons of resol and o-cresol-/p-cresol-/phenol-/resorcinol-Novolac resins appeared within
103.88–145.79 ppm.

Figure 2 13C NMR of (a) NR, (b) CBD, and (c)
NRCBD.

In NRCBD, although all the characteristic
peaks of NR showed marginal
shifts, relative intensities altered substantially (Table S1). As compared to NR, relative enhancement of intensities
for both the olefinic carbons and notable increase in relative intensities
for both −C(CH3)=CH–CH2– and −C(CH3)=CH–
confirmed substantial conversion of −C(CH3)=CH–
into −CH(CH3)–CH2–. In
this regard, CBD-aided change in intensities was ignored as CBD was
devoid of peaks at 23.37, 26.36, 32.17, 124.99, and 135.16 ppm. In
fact, sulfur-/nonsulfur-curing of NR usually accompanied by the substantial
loss of unsaturation. NR-curing using CBD was confirmed from the arrival
of CBD-specific peaks in NRCBD at 173.99, 157.28, 59.32, 55.54, 48.39,
30.11, 26.78, 20.17, and 17.62 ppm, attributed to >C=O
of Gly/Pro/Hyp, Cε of Arg32/>C=O of MU/1,3-DMU/1,1-DMU,31Cα of Pro/Cα of Hyp, Cδ of Hyp/Cα of Glu/Cα of Asp/Cα of Lys, Cδ of Pro, Cδ of Lys/Cβ of Glu, Cγ of Lys, Cγ of Pro, and Cβ of Ala, respectively.31 In addition to the curing related loss of unsaturation,
the formation of the chromane ring was inferred from the arrival of
chromane ring-specific peaks at 32.68, 74.01, 122.10, and 147.32 because
of C-3, C-2, C-4a, and C-8a, respectively, in NRCBD (Figure 2c).33 Therefore,
in NRCBD, the cross-linking of NR by tanning agents of CBD could be
represented by the most widely accepted chromane mechanism related
to resin curing of unsaturated rubber (Figure 1).

FTIR Analyses
In NRCBD, peaks at
1288, 984, and 2915
cm–1 appeared because of C=C–H in
plane bending, C=C twisting, and C–H sym. str. of −CH2–/–CH3 adjacent to C=C of uncured-NR,
respectively, receded from view because of the destruction of NR-specific
C=C in NRCBD.34 In this regard,
the characteristic sym. str. Band-splitting of C–H
into 2928 and 2915 cm–1, observed usually in NR
because of the double bond adjacent to −CH3/–CH2–, disappeared in NRCBD because of the reaction between
C=C of NR and CBD (Figure 3). In fact, permanent disappearance of C=C of
NR was realized from the obsolescence of peaks at 1288, 984, and 2915
cm–1 in all the Hg(II)-/dye-adsorbed NRCBD. Alongside,
the massive loss of such unsaturation and thereby the formation of
chromane rings was apprehended from NMR analyses (Figure 2). Indeed, alteration in NR-backbone
via C=C led to obliteration of several NR-specific C–C
vibrations at 490, 741, and 930/1009 cm–1 for C–C–C
in plane bending, −CH2– rocking, and C–C str., respectively.34 Alongside, as compared to CBD, the partial disappearance
of −CH2OH/O–H in NRCBD was realized from
the obsolescence of the peak at 2876(sh), along with considerable
decrease in the broad and intense peak from 3405 cm–1 of CBD to 3399 cm–1 in NRCBD (Figure 3). The formation of new type
of ether linkages in NRCBD became evident from substantial alteration
of the spectrum within 1185–1085 cm–1. In
this regard, arrival of new peaks at 1126 and 1097 cm–1 were ascribed to C–O–C sym. str.
and C–O–C asym. str. of alkyl–aryl
ethers, respectively. Altogether, simultaneous destruction of NR-specific
C=C, decrease in the number of −CH2OH/O–H,
and the formation of alkyl–aryl ether linkage could be commenced
through the reaction between C=C of NR and −CH2OH/O–H of the methylol-phenol ring of the phenol-formaldehyde
resin in CBD for producing a new chromane ring in NRCBD.35 Though chromane ring-specific peaks of CBD completely
retained in NRCBD, the formation of new chromane rings or modification
of existing chromanes were identified through varied shifts of characteristic
chromane-based vibration frequencies from CBD to NRCBD (Table S2).35

Figure 3 FTIR of NR,
CBD, NRCBD, and SF-/BCB-/Hg(II)-NRCBD.

Notably, the broad and intense peak of NRCBD at 3399 cm–1 became remarkably flattened and less intense in Hg(II)-NRCBD.
In
this regard, the arrival of new peaks at 3409 and 3433 cm–1 suggested appreciable destruction of preexisting N–H/O–H
mutual H-bond of NRCBD in Hg(II)-NRCBD (Figure 3). The preferential association of Hg(II)
with N-donor as compared to the O-donor ligand could be responsible
for massive decrease in the N–H/O–H mutual H-bond, which
led to the relatively higher population of O–H in Hg(II)-NRCBD.
Such higher population of O–H was ascribed to the presence
of Hg(OH)2/H–Hg–OH/HgO in Hg(II)-NRCBD, realized
from the arrival of several new peaks within 3910–3789 cm–1. In addition, the preferable attachment of Hg(II)
with the N-donor resulted in the complete omission of >NH+–, >C=NH+–, and >NH2+-specific peaks in Hg(II)-NRCBD.

Interestingly,
as a result of BCB adsorption, the N–H/O–H
mutual H-bond peak shifted from 3399 of NRCBD to 3429 cm–1 in BCB-NRCBD, along with significant lowering of aromatic C–H str. form 3088 cm–1 of NRCBD to 3066 cm–1 in BCB-NRCBD (Figure 3). Additionally, in contrast to both NRCBD and SF-NRCBD,
several peaks corresponding to strong O–H/O–H H-bond
were found in BCB-NRCBD. All of these phenomena indicated the presence
of BCB dimers or multilayers carrying sandwiched water entrapped via
strong H-bond, as BCB tends to produce dimers at much lower concentration
(i.e., 0.2 × 10–3 M). In contrast, all of these
changes were not observed in SF-NRCBD, as SF is less prone to form
dimers onto NRCBD during adsorption.36 All
other peaks of both SF-NRCBD and BCB-NRCBD retained, suggesting reversible
interactions between dyes and NRCBD.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Analyses
NRCBD
The deconvoluted C 1s spectrum of NRCBD constituted
of peaks at 284.87, 285.33, 285.75, 286.15, 286.50, and 286.87 eV
(Figure 4a) for C 1s
of −CH2–/–CH3 of chromane/phenol, tertiary C–H, C1 of phenol, Cα of amino acid, C2 of chromane ring/ether, and >C=N
of
melamine/–CONH2/–CONH–/–COOH, respectively. All of these
peaks were significantly deviated from the usual NR peaks at 284.73,
285.00, and 285.28 eV for −(CH2CH=C(CH3)CH2)n–, −(CH2CH=C(CH3)CH2)n–, and −(CH2CH=C(CH3)CH2)n–, respectively.
Moreover, the O 1s peaks at 530.20, 531.02, 532.06, 532.82, and 533.67
eV (Figure 4b) were
attributed to polysaccharides/glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), Cr(OH)3, >C=O, chromane/ether/–COO–, and O–H, respectively.
Alongside, the N 1s spectrum was deconvoluted into peaks at 398.05
and 399.67 eV (Figure 4c) designated to pyrrolidine units of proline/hydroxyproline and
−NH–/–NH2/C–N of collagen, respectively.29 Accordingly, the prevalence of O 1s/N 1s-specific peaks
in NRCBD confirmed the substantial incorporation of CBD into the NR-network.
More importantly, as realized earlier from NMR and Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) results, the formation of the chromane ring or related
ether linkages in NRCBD was substantiated from the newly generated
C 1s peak at 286.50 eV in NRCBD that was attributed exclusively to
the carbon attached to oxygen of the chromane ring or ether linkage
produced via curing of NR by the Novolac component of CBD. Interestingly,
almost similar kind of relative intensities of 0.211 and 0.205 for
the chromane/ether/–COO–-specific
O 1s peak at 532.82 eV and chromane/ether-specific C 1s peak at 286.5
eV, respectively, confirmed the substantial prevalence of chromane
rings in NRCBD. Simultaneously, the presence of −COO– was determined from the marginal difference between
relative intensities (i.e., 0.211–0.205 = 0.05) of these peaks.

Figure 4 XPS analyses
of C 1s (a,d,h,j) and O 1s (b,e,i,k) for NRCBD and
Hg(II)-, BCB-, and SF-NRCBD, N 1s (c,f) for NRCBD and Hg(II)-NRCBD,
and Hg 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 (g) for Hg(II)-NRCBD.

Hg(II)-NRCBD
Because
of the binding between Hg(II)
and NRCBD, the polysaccharides/GAGs and Cr(OH)3-specific O 1s peaks of NRCBD were substantially raised to 531.18
and 531.61 eV (Figure 4e), respectively, indicating coordination of Hg(II) with O-donor
of −SO3– and chromium complexes,
leading to the increased binding energies (BEs) and associated alterations
in intensities of those O 1s peaks (Table S3). Moreover, the remaining O 1s peaks were marginally shifted from
532.06, 532.82, and 533.67 to 532.25, 532.83, and 533.78 eV in Hg(II)-NRCBD
(Figure 4e), inferring
ionization of −COOH and related weaker physicochemical interaction
between O-donor and Hg(II). In this context, during Hg(II) adsorption,
deprotonation of −COOH of NRCBD to −COO– at pHi > pHPZC was ascertained from the
appreciably
elevated relative intensity of the O 1s peak from 0.211 at 532.82
eV of NRCBD to 0.342 at 532.83 eV in Hg(II)-NRCBD, along with reduced
intensity of the >C=O peak from 0.294 at 532.06 eV of NRCBD
to 0.135 at 532.25 eV in Hg(II)-NRCBD (Table S3). Surprisingly, despite ionization of −COOH to −COO–, substantial increase in the intensity was noted for
the O–H-specific peak from 0.22 at 533.67 eV to 0.30 at 533.78
eV, attributed to the deposition of Hg(OH)2 onto Hg(II)-NRCBD. Indeed, deposition of Hg(OH)2 and strong coordinate bonding between Hg(II) and N-donor
of pyrrolidine of proline/hydroxyproline and −NH–/–NH2/C–N of the collagen in NRCBD led to substantial changes in N 1s BEs
to 398.83 and 403.95 eV in Hg(II)-NRCBD (Figure 4f), together with the decrease in HgCl2-specific Hg 4f7/2- and Hg 4f5/2-BE
from 102.58 and 106.68 to 100.93 and 104.63 eV in Hg(II)-NRCBD, respectively
(Figure 4g).37 Indeed, cumulative effects of Hg(II) adsorption
and related phenomena were also reflected in both the altered C 1s
peak positions (Figure 4d) and respective peak intensities in Hg(II)-NRCBD (Table S3).

BCB-NRCBD
The C 1s X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of BCB-NRCBD comprised of peaks at 284.89, 285.42, 285.91,
286.34, 286.75, and 287.04 eV (Figure 4h), of which peaks at 284.89, 285.42, and 285.91 eV,
assigned to −CH2–/–CH3 of chromane, tertiary C–H,
and C1 of phenolic species, respectively, remained almost
unaltered as compared to those of NRCBD, interpreting the least direct
and/or indirect involvement of such group(s) in adsorption of BCB.
However, peaks at 286.34, 286.75, and 287.04 eV because of Cα of amino acid, C2 of
chromane ring/ether, and >C=N of melamine/–CONH2/–CONH–/–COOH, respectively, were shifted significantly toward higher
BE than NRCBD. Such higher values of BEs could be explained by the
decrease in electron densities at the C-donor via noncovalent interactions
between the lone pair and/or negatively charged N–O adjacent
to the C-donor and ammonium cation of BCB. Moreover, the appreciable
increase in relative population of hydrophilic groups at the surface
of BCB-NRCBD led to remarkable changes in the relative intensities
of all C 1s peaks. Indeed, adsorption-driven relative lowering in
the population of hydrophobic rubber moieties at the surface could
be anticipated from the drastic drop in peak intensity corresponding
to tertiary C–H and chromane-/ether-specific peaks
at 285.42 and 286.75 eV. On contrary, increased population of hydrophilic
parts at the surface, along with deposition of BCB increased the intensities
of peaks. Alongside, BE of O 1s peaks were shifted to 530.81, 531.76,
532.00, 532.62, and 533.67 eV (Figure 4i), indicating the adsorption-driven alterations in
physicochemical interactions of the adsorbed BCB-cation with the anionic
part of NRCBD within BCB-NRCBD. Such ionic interactions and associated
deprotonation of −COOH into −COO– were
rationalized from the reasonable drop in intensity of C=O and O–H peaks at 532.00 and 533.67 eV,
respectively, together with a significant gain in intensity of the
−COO–-specific peak. Besides, unprecedented
rise in peak intensities at 530.81 and 531.76 eV was rationally understood
from the significant deposition of ZnO and Zn(OH)2 onto BCB-NRCBD (Table S3). In this context, co-existence of Zn(OH)2 and ZnO at the BCB-NRCBD could be anticipated from
the possible conversion of ZnCl42–counter
anion of BCB into Zn(OH)2 at pHi = 9.0, followed
by transformation of Zn(OH)2 into ZnO during drying of
BCB-NRCBD at 70 °C.38

SF-NRCBD
Almost similar types of physicochemical interactions
were confirmed in SF-NRCBD, wherein C 1s peaks were positioned at
284.90, 285.58, 286.13, 286.74, 287.18, and 287.39 eV (Figure 4j). Likewise, O 1s spectra
of SF-NRCBD demonstrated significant alterations in peak positions
with BEs of 530.60, 531.49, 532.29, 532.94, and 533.72 eV, indicating
a substantial change in the electron cloud environment within SF-NRCBD
(Figure 4k). For instance,
similar to BCB-NRCBD, ionization of −COOH into −COO– could be understood from the drop of relative intensity
at 533.72 eV, along with the increase in relative intensity at 532.94
eV.

Thermogravimetric Analysis Analyses
Within 30–200
°C, relatively higher weight loss of CBD (i.e., 11.4 wt %) as
compared to NR (i.e., 2.4 wt %) (Figure 5a) was ascribed to the higher moisture content
because of the prevalent hydrophilic constituents, such as tannin,
synthetic tannin, protein, and fatty substances of CBD. Accordingly,
relatively lower mass loss for NR was expected because of the strong
hydrophobic nature of NR. Invariably, the extent of mass loss from
NRCBD was in between NR and CBD. Notably, within 30–355 °C,
the thermal stability was noted in the followed order: NR > NRCBD
> CBD (Figure 5a).
Such outcome was attributed to the relatively poor thermal stability
of the collagen component in CBD, which underwent pronounced deamination
from 250 to 360 °C, resulting in the formation of ammonia via
decomposition of −NH– and −NH2 in
arginine and lysine. In this context, arginine and lysine remain as
51 and 25 residues per 1000 residues of tropocollagen.39 At the higher temperature range, that is, within
360–700 °C, relatively better thermal stability of NRCBD
over NR/CBD was ascribed to the possible reaction between phenol-formaldehyde
resin of CBD and isoprene units of NR, leading to the formation of
new thermostable covalent linkage. The overall elevated thermal stability
of NRCBD over NR was also substantiated by the appreciably higher
DTG at 376 °C for NRCBD than the characteristic DTG of unvulcanized
NR at 364 °C (Figure S1). Interestingly,
beyond 360 °C, the thermal resistance of CBD exceeded appreciably
as compared to NR.

Figure 5 TGA of (a) NR, CBD, and NRCBD and (b) NRCBD, BCB-, SF-,
and Hg(II)-NRCBD.

It transpired that the
prevalent thermo-resistant melamine-formaldehyde
resin in CBD, confirmed from FTIR analysis, played a dominant role
in enhancing the thermal stability of CBD as compared to NR. Notably,
a drastic thermal degradation for Hg(II)-NRCBD was observed within
30–370 °C (Figure 5b). The lower boiling point of mercury and HgCl2 was responsible for faster evaporation of loosely bound mercury
components from Hg(II)-NRCBD.

However, within 370–465
°C, better thermal stability
of Hg(II)-NRCBD than NRCBD was ascribed to the interaction between
absorbed Hg(II) and nitrogen of the melamine to produce a thermo-resistant
triazine ring-mercury assembly. However, beyond 465 °C, thermal
stability of Hg(II)-NRCBD became inferior to that of NRCBD, attributed
to the decomposition of triazine ring-mercury assembly and HgO in
a rapid fashion. In this context, massive removal of mercury from
Hg(II)-NRCBD was also reflected by the least residue (i.e., 1.8 wt
%) (Figure 5b). Though
the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plot of BCB-NRCBD was almost
similar to that of NRCBD, the thermogram of SF-NRCBD was slightly
different from both BCB-NRCBD and NRCBD. Such change was attributed
to the greater adsorbing tendency of SF onto NRCBD, as SF shows relatively
lesser dimer forming tendency than that of BCB and preferably remains
as monomer in 0.2 × 10–3 M solution. On contrary,
relatively higher dimer forming tendency of BCB was ascribed to the
better relative affinity of BCB to remain mostly in the monomeric
form at <5 × 10–5 M solution. Accordingly,
penetration and diffusion of sterically favored SF-monomer into NRCBD
was better than the BCB-dimer. In this context, the phenol-formaldehyde-based
tanning reagent of CBD reacted with the C=C of NR to form chromanes
(Figure 1).40 However, according to the viewpoint of van der
Meer, a methylene-quinone intermediate, generated from methylol-phenol
of the phenol-formaldehyde resin, could also react at the methylene
group adjacent to the C=C of the isoprene unit in NR (Scheme S1).40

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry Analyses
The differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of CBD demonstrated a broad
and intense endothermic peak at 106 °C because of the moisture-enriched
collagenic materials bearing variegated thermal stabilities as a result
of diversified interactions between collagen and various tanning agents.41 However, complete obsolescence of such a broad
and intense peak in NRCBD was associated with substantial stabilization
of the CBD-component in NRCBD via formation of the chromane ring.
Indeed, owing to such curing-driven irreversible alterations, the
CBD-specific peak at 106 °C never reappeared in Hg(II)-, BCB-,
and SF-NRCBD (Figure S2). Alongside, CBD-aided
curing of NR resulted in the elevated thermal resistance of NRCBD
as compared to NR, realized from the complete disappearance of NR
degradation-specific broad endothermic peak at 392 °C in NRCBD.
Nevertheless, collagen degradation-related endothermic peaks were
present both in CBD and NRCBD at 328 and 323 °C, respectively.42 Moreover, endothermic transitions at 159/160,
164/163, and 394 °C because of the breakdown of methylol melamine,
condensation reaction, and degradation of triazine rings of melamine
formaldehyde, respectively,43 were retained
in the thermograms of both CBD and NRCBD, suggesting minimal interactions
between the melamine formaldehyde components of CBD and NR in NRCBD
(Figure S2). However, all of these melamine-specific
endothermic peaks were disappeared in Hg(II)-NRCBD, suggesting stabilization
of melamine components of CBD by Hg(II) via co-ordinate- or covalent-bonding,
evidenced from XPS and TGA analyses.

X-ray Diffraction Analyses
The fibrous CBD showed intense
peaks of collagen at 21.04° and 31.43° because of the amorphous
scattering from randomly distributed components of collagen fibers
and axial increase in distance (i.e., 2.80 Å) between the amino
acid residues along collagen triple helices, respectively.39,44 However, the relatively amorphous nature of NRCBD as compared to
both NR and CBD indicated the complete destruction of the short range
order in NRCBD because of the adequate intermingling of rubber and
fibers in consequence to the reaction between rubber chains and phenol-formaldehyde-based
component of CBD. Interestingly, the diffractogram of Hg(II)-NRCBD
showed several sharp peaks of variable intensities (Figure S3). The sharp peak at 28.77° corresponding to
3.104 Å is almost identical to one of the dimensions of the HgO
crystal (i.e., 3.111 Å), reflecting the FTIR results related
to the deposition of HgO onto Hg(II)-NRCBD.45 Besides, superficial deposition of mercuric chloride and mercuric
amide chlorides was related to the use of mercuric chloride salt as
adsorbate and stronger interaction of Hg(II) with the N-donor, as
evidenced in the FTIR. As the adsorption was carried out at neutral
pH, superficial depositions of mercuric hydroxide and mercuric oxide
could strongly be recommended. Moreover, peaks at 44.40 and 46.84°
were comparable to the 112 and 220 Miller planes of mercuric sulphate
crystals deposited onto Hg(II)-NRCBD that altered sulfonic acid salt-related
peaks in FTIR (Figure 3). Additionally, among the dye-adsorbed adsorbents, though SF-NRCBD
was devoid of any peak, the diffractogram of BCB-NRCBD constituted
of small peaks at 21.16, 43.53, 52.32, and 57.09°, which signified
the mixed population of ε-Zn(OH)2 and ZnO onto NRCBD.38 Indeed, the presence of Zn(OH)2 and
ZnO onto BCB-NRCBD, inferred earlier in XPS analyses, was ascribed
to the conversion of the ZnCl42–-component
of BCB into Zn(OH)2 and ZnO because of the adsorption in
the alkaline environment and subsequent dehydration of Zn(OH)2 into ZnO at 70 °C.

SEM and Energy-Dispersive
Spectroscopy Analyses
Fine
structures of collagen fibers in CBD disappeared in the heterogeneous
topography of NRCBD (Figure S4), suggesting
the rubbery layer formation onto the collagen fibrils. The enormous
phase mixing and complete destruction of the short range order in
NRCBD was ascribed to the reaction between rubber chains and Novolac
components of CBD, also evidenced from FTIR and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) results. Moreover, postadsorptive particulate depositions onto
Hg(II)-NRCBD were attributed to the presence of mercuric compounds
because of the interaction between adsorbed Hg(II) and available functional
groups of NRCBD (Figure S4).

Experimental
Design and Model Development
ACs of NRCBD
for removal of SF and BCB were influenced individually or simultaneously
by several parameters, such as concentration of SF/BCB (mg L–1, A), temperature (°C, B),
and pHi (−, C). Therefore, optimization
of parameters is essential to attain the highest ACs of NRCBD. However,
measurement of individual and/or simultaneous effect(s) via one factor
at a time is unempirical. Therefore, design of experiment has been
introduced to reduce the number of experiments and measure the individual
and/or simultaneous effect(s) through central composite design (CCD)
analysis.

CCD Optimization of the Significant Variables
The CCD
was introduced to understand the significant effects of individual
and interactive effects of A, B,
and C on ACs. The calculated ACs were interlinked with input variables
for optimization using following empirical second-order polynomial
equation (eq 2) 2  

Here, Y, β0, and βm, βmm, and βmn represent
the predicted response, constant, and linear-, quadratic-, and interaction-coefficient,
respectively. The CCD was executed involving 20 runs (Table S4) for each dye, in which A, B, and C were taken within 40.00–10.00
mg L–1, 30.00–50.00 °C, and 8.00–12.00/7.00–11.00,
respectively. The applicability of the model was examined by analyzing
the analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Table 2). The process variables and actual- and
predicted-response were listed in Table S4. Additionally, CCD analysis determined reliability of the quadratic
model as compared to linear-, 2FI-, quadratic-, and cubic-model because
of higher R2, that is, 0.9966 and 0.9959
for SF and BCB, respectively, and close vicinity between adj. and
pred. R2, that is, 0.9935/0.9736 and 0.9921/0.9679
for SF and BCB, respectively.

From
ANOVA table, A, B, AC, BC, A2, B2, and C2 and A, C, AC, BC, A2, B2,
and C2 for SF and BCB, respectively, were
noted to be significant (Table 2). The final equations obtained from the model in terms of
actual factors were expressed using eqs 3 and 4. 3   4  

The three dimensional
response surface plots (Figure 6a–f) showed the interactive
effects among AB, AC, and BC. Finally, in the numerical optimization section, A, B, and C were considered
in range, whereas ACs were considered to be the maximum. A, B, and C were found to be 31.15/28.64,
45.24/39.92, and 9.94/8.99 for SF/BCB, respectively.

Adsorption Isotherm Study
Mutual interactions between
adsorbate (i.e., BCB, SF, and Hg(II)) and adsorbent (i.e., NRCBD)
during isothermal adsorption was understood from the ACs/qe of adsorbents. The residual adsorbate concentration
(Ce) at equilibrium was fitted with Langmuir,
Freundlich, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and Sips isotherms
(eqs 5–8). 5   6   7   8  Here, kL, kF, k1, k2, and kS are isotherm
constants
and qmax, n, bT, qBET, and γ
are isotherm parameters. Moreover, adsorption isotherm studies confirmed
the fractional distribution of adsorbate within solid and solution
phases. In fact, the excellent performance potential of NRCBD was
ascertained from high ACs and removal proficiency.

The adsorption
isotherm studies were performed taking 0.01 g biocomposite and 50
mL buffer solutions within 5–40 ppm of dyes/Hg(II) at pHi = 9.0/7.0 and 293–323 K. The Langmuir- and BET-model
fitted the best for SF/Hg(II) and BCB, respectively, (Figure 7a–c), as evident from
the highest R2- and F-value (Table 3).
Langmuir model predominantly considers the prevalence of monolayer
adsorption onto the homogeneous surface of NRCBD. In this context,
chemisorption of SF was understood from the temperature-dependent
increase in kL from 0.2172 to 0.3186.
Indeed, the chemical interaction between =N+Me2/=N+HMe of SF and −COO–/–OH of NRCBD resulted in high qmax, which altered significantly from 280.17 to 348.36 mg g–1 with increase in temperature up to 323 K. The qmax of Hg(II) was relatively lower, that is, 166.46 mg
g–1, because of the strong ionic interaction-based
adsorption and low concentrations. In this context, separation factor
(RL), a dimensionless quantity, measuring
feasibility of any adsorption process, in which RL > 1, 0 < RL < 1, RL = 1 and RL = 0
indicate unfavorable, favorable, linear, and irreversible adsorptions,
respectively, was estimated using eq 9. 9

The spontaneity of adsorption
was confirmed measuring RL within 0.05–0.55
and 0.09–0.25 for SF
and Hg(II), respectively.

Conversely, the preferential multilayer
adsorption via dye–adsorbent
and dye–dye interactions was ascertained from the best fitting
of BCB adsorption data to the BET model. Moreover, an increase in qBET and k1 with
increase in temperature from 293 to 323 K indicated more favorable
adsorption at relatively higher temperatures. In fact, the reverse
variation of k2 with temperature indicated
the decrease in dye–dye interactions at relatively higher temperatures
because of the enhancement of average kinetic energy of dyes.

Adsorption
Kinetics Study
The mechanism of adsorption
is identified by the rate determining step, mass transport, and diffusion
processes. Herein, kinetics studies were carried out taking different
initial concentrations of dyes/Hg(II), using 0.01 g of NRCBD at definite
pHi and four different temperatures (Figures 7d–f and S4a–c). Adsorption data of SF, BCB, and Hg(II) followed pseudosecond order
kinetics at all temperatures because of the higher R2-, F-value and the closest proximity
between qe,exp and qe,cal (Table 3). All model fitted parameters support the chemisorption through
ionic interaction between −COO– and O–H
of NRCBD and SF/BCB/Hg(II), evidenced earlier in XPS (Figure 4) and FTIR analyses (Figure 3). Initially, a faster
rate of chemisorption for SF, BCB, and Hg(II) was ascribed to the
maximum population of functional groups onto the adsorbent surface,
followed by the gradual decrease in rate, and finally, almost a constant
rate at the equilibrium. The pseudosecond order rate constants (k2) for SF and Hg(II) increased with the increase
in temperature because of the elevated physicochemical interactions
at higher temperatures. In spite of similar chemical structures, dye–dye
and dye–NRCBD interactions resulted in the higher k2 for BCB (Table 3). Thus, because of the molecular aggregation, qe,exp and qe,cal were greater
for BCB as compared to SF within 293–303 K (Table 3), realised from TGA (Figure 5) and XRD (Figure S3). Thus, restricted the permeation of
(BCB)2 via tortuous path affected the rate of adsorption.
However, larger overall molecular weight of (BCB)2 than
SF resulted in the higher amount of BCB onto the composite matrix
(Table 3), and thus, qe of BCB was higher than SF at 303 K. 10   11  

Effect of Temperature on
Adsorption Kinetics
The effect
of temperature on chemisorption was envisaged taking 0.01 g NRCBD
in 40 ppm solutions of both the dyes and Hg(II) at 293, 303, 313,
and 323 K and pHi = 9/7 (Figure S5a–c). Because both the dyes and Hg(II) followed pseudosecond order kinetics,
activation energy of adsorption (Ea) was
evaluated using the following Arrhenius type equation (eqs 12 and 13): 12  that is 13  Here, k0, R, and T are temperature-independent factors
(g mg–1 min–1), universal gas
constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1) and
temperature (K), respectively. In fact, from the slope of ln k2 vs 1/T plot, Ea of adsorption can be evaluated (Figure S5g). However, Ea values
were: 25.26, 22.53, and 21.93 kJ mol–1 for SF, BCB,
and Hg(II), respectively, inferred chemisorption for both the dyes/Hg(II).

Thermodynamics of Adsorption
The Gibbs free-energy
change (ΔG0) associated with the
thermodynamic spontaneity of chemisorption was evaluated using eq 14. 14  Here, kd, that
is, the distribution coefficient, is defined as the ratio of dye concentrations
in solid to liquid phases at equilibrium (eq 15). 15  Here, qe (mg g–1) and Ce (mg L–1) are equilibrium AC and residual
concentration of adsorbate in the
solution, respectively.

Thus, the slope and intercept of the
linear plot of ln kd vs 1/T (Figure S5d–f) of eq 16 determined ΔH0 and ΔS0, respectively
(Table 2). 16  

Herein, the negative ΔG0 for
dyes and Hg(II) (Table 4) indicated spontaneous chemisorption.46,47 However, gradual
increase in −ΔG0 for adsorption
of both the dyes and Hg(II) with the rise in temperature confirmed
the enhancement of physicochemical interactions at relatively higher
temperatures. In addition, the exothermic nature of adsorption was
inferred from the negative ΔH0 (Figure S5d–f), whereas positive ΔS0 specified the increase in randomness at the
solid–solution interface during adsorption of BCB, SF, and
Hg(II).

UV–vis Studies on Adsorption of SF and BCB
The
absorption spectra of concentrated aqueous solution of BCB envisaged
an intense band at 622 nm and a shoulder at 577 nm because of the
BCB-monomer and H-type dimer, respectively.36 In this regard, the relative lowering in the intensity of the dimer-specific
peak was ascribed to the increasing dilution with the progress of
adsorption (Figure 8a,b). Indeed, such a dilution effect in minimizing the dimer population
was also realized from the adsorption spectra of dilute aqueous solution
of BCB showing significantly less prominent shoulder at 577 nm. On
contrary, absorption spectra of SF were devoid of dimer-specific peaks
because of lesser aggregating tendency of SF as compared to BCB (Figure 8c,d), presumed earlier
from TGA analysis. Accordingly, because of the lack of dimers and
lower aggregating tendency,48 SF showed
sterically favored faster adsorption onto NRCBD. In this regard, removal
of SF and BCB were 76.01 and 64.5%, respectively, within 300 min,
realized from the relatively faster time-dependent hypochromic change
in the intensity of SF as compared to BCB (Figure 8). Moreover, deposition of ZnO and Zn(OH)2 onto BCB-NRCBD, as determined from XPS and XRD results, hindered
the adsorption of BCB onto NRCBD.

ppm) and (b/d) SF (5/40
ppm).

Desorption and Reusability
The recyclability of NRCBD
was substantiated by studying adsorption at pHi = 7.0 and
9.0/10.0 for Hg(II) and BCB/SF, respectively. Alongside, the desorption
was carried out at pHi = 2.0 and 0.1 M NaCl solution for
Hg(II) and BCB/SF (Figure 9), respectively. In fact, significantly higher adsorption
up to 85% even after five adsorption–desorption cycles inferred
excellent reusability of NRCBD.

NaCl solution; (b) reusability
plots of Hg(II)-, BCB-, and SF-NRCBD.

Comparison of the Results
Different low cost natural,
physically- and/or chemically-modified material(s), blends, homo-/co-/ter-polymers,
and IPN-/composite-hydrogel have been employed for the adsorptive
removal of Hg(II), BCB, and SF at varying temperatures (i.e., 288–323
K), pHi, and initial concentrations (i.e., 1–3800
ppm) (Table S5). The ACs of NRCBD were
excellent as compared to previously reported adsorbents.

Conclusions
The present work reports the nonsulfur curing of NR using Novolac
components of waste CBD to fabricate collagenic material-based NRCBD–biocomposite
superadsorbent showing very high removal proficiency and recyclability.
The chromane mechanism of curing has been inferred from the arrival
of chromane ring-specific peaks at 32.68, 74.01, 122.10, and 147.33
ppm in 13C NMR and enormous lowering in peak intensities
of olefinic carbons of NR, inferred from C 1s-/O 1s-XPS and FTIR analyses.
Moreover, incorporation of nitrogen-based materials has been inferred
from the appearance of MMU, 1,1-/1,3-DMU, and triazine ring-specific
peaks in 13C NMR, apprehended by FTIR and TGA analyses.
The ionic interaction between −COO– and =N+Me2/=N+HMe of dyes/Hg(II) has
been confirmed via extensive XPS and FTIR analyses. In comparison
to SF, slightly delayed adsorption of BCB was attributed to the higher
dimer forming ability of BCB as compared to SF because of the surface
depositions of zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide, restricting the adsorption
of BCB onto NRCBD, confirmed from XPS and XRD results, along with
the measurements of isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics parameters.
The collagenic-waste and NP-based NRCBD–biocomposite can be
employed for fabricating CBD-cured other rubber adsorbents for decontamination
and reuse of dyes and Hg(II). NRCBD showing excellent recyclability,
performance characteristics, and outstanding adsorption efficiency
has shown the novelty in a kinetically fast and thermodynamically
spontaneous waste remediation process.
