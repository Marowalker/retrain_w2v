Quasi-one-dimensional
structures from metal
oxides have shown remarkable potentials with regard to their applicability
in advanced technologies ranging from ultraresponsive nanoelectronic
devices to advanced healthcare tools. Particularly due to the piezoresistive
effects, zinc oxide (ZnO)-based nanowires showed outstanding performance
in a large number of applications, including energy harvesting, flexible
electronics, smart sensors, etc. In the present work, we demonstrate
the versatile crystal engineering of ZnO nano- and microwires (up

To investigate the piezoresistive properties, particular ZnO nanowires
were integrated on an electrical push-to-pull device, which enables
the application of tensile strain and measurement of in situ electrical

been discussed in terms of defect relaxations.

1 Introduction
Quasi-one-dimensional
(Q1D) structures, such as nanorods, nanowires,
nanotubes, and nanobelts, etc. of inorganic materials have shown remarkable
potential with regard to their utilization in several applications
ranging from ultraresponsive nanoelectronic devices to advanced healthcare
diagnostic systems.1−7 Nanowires consisting of metal oxide semiconductors have drawn particular
research interest because of their high surface to volume ratios,
unique shapes and surface morphologies, application-relevant bandgaps,
particular crystal structures, bendability, etc.8−11 These Q1D nanowire structures
have already shown significant potential in the context of energy
storage in the form of photovoltaics, solar cells, electrochemical
cells, and supercapacitors.12−15 Both, the size and the crystal structure play an
important role in enabling the advanced applications of Q1D nanostructures.
Recently, a new class of application for nanowires, so-called self-powered
devices, has emerged, in which the nanowire is utilized as a power
generator for driving an electronic device under the influence of
some external stimuli, such as stress, temperature, or UV light.16−20 In this context, zinc oxide (ZnO) has garnered significant research
interest because of its wide and direct UV-sensitive bandgap (∼3.37
eV) and large exciton binding energy (∼60 meV).21,22 On the one hand, the hexagonal-wurtzite-type structure facilitates
easy growth of various types of Q1D structures from ZnO, and on the
other hand, the absence of an inversion center enables piezoelectric
property in these Q1D nanowires.21,22 These piezoelectric
and semiconductor properties have resulted in research focuses for
applications in piezoresistive or piezotronics, piezophototronics,
and energy-harvesting devices.23−31 Owing to their biocompatible and luminescent (blue and green) features,
the ZnO nanorods and nanowires exhibit significant potentials for
utilizations in advanced sensing devices and in biomedical applications.32−35 Thus, equipped with interesting functionalities, Q1D ZnO nanostructures
are potential key candidates for the next generation of advanced technologies.

Despite their quite high technological relevancy, these Q1D nano-
and micro-structures strongly suffer from device integration issues.
To measure the properties, the nanowire structures need to be properly
connected with the test instrumentation, representing a complicated
task. Owing to the dimensions, placing nanowires at the desired location
and aligning them to form appropriate electrical contacts are the
challenging steps in nanoelectronic device fabrications. This sometimes
requires a multistep fabrication process.3,4,36−39 To overcome these barriers, several
unconventional strategies40−42 have been introduced, but simpler
nanodevice fabrication is still highly desired. In general, the Q1D
nanostructure-based electronic devices are fabricated in two ways:
(i) synthesis of nanowires (physical, chemical, or biological routes),
followed by their integration between the electrical contacts on the
patterned microchips; and (ii) fabrication of Q1D nanostructures directly
on the microchips. For the versatile utilization of Q1D structures,
the synthesis of dimensionally compact nanowires by simple processes
is one of the first and foremost requirement. Free-standing Q1D nano-
and micro-structures with diameters in the submicron region and lengths
up to several hundred micrometers seem to be very suitable candidates
in this context as they can be very easily utilized in various ways.
However, controlled growth of such large nano- and microwires that
possess adequate structural integrity requires sophisticated growth
methods.

In this respect, the recently introduced flame transport
synthesis
(FTS) approach has shown unique potential in terms of a simple growth
process and versatile structuring (from 1D to three-dimensional interconnected
networks).43,44 Because 1D structures are the
main focus of this study, controlled growth of ZnO Q1D nano- and micro-structures
with size scales spanning from nanometers to centimeters by the FTS
approach in a simple, rapid, and single-step process is presented
here. An important variable to the understanding of piezoresistive
properties is the type of strain applied to an individual nanorod.
Prior studies have generally utilized the bending of a substrate or
piezoforce microscope to apply the strain in the nanowires.45 Owing to the unavailability of appropriate devices
that can grip and apply tensile strain in individual nanowires, the
experimental studies for characterizing the electrical properties
under tensile stress are lacking. In general, a typical piezoelectrical
device consists of a semiconductor nanostructure with a noncentrosymmetric
crystal structure, such as ZnO, GaN, etc., with two metallic electrodes
connected at both ends. Therefore, the change in electronic transport
properties in such devices combines the piezoresistive effect in the
nanowire and a possibility of a piezotronic effect from the two contacts
at the end.45−47 In this article, we demonstrate a novel in situ characterization
strategy for direct measurement of electrical properties of the nanowires
and present an effect of piezoresistive response of the Q1D ZnO nanowires
under tensile strain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study revealing the detailed quantitative electromechanical characterization
of an ultralarge Q1D ZnO single crystalline nanowire under tensile
strain.

2 Results and Discussion
The appropriate
length scales together with the desirable morphologies
of Q1D structures are important aspects playing major roles with regard
to their structure–property relations as well as corresponding
technological applications. Therefore, the growth of large varieties
of Q1D ZnO nano- and micro-structures would be highly desirable, and
this can be easily achieved by the developed FTS approach.43 By varying the experimental parameters, Q1D
ZnO wires with length scales ranging from a few hundred nanometers
to almost a centimeter have been successfully grown, as demonstrated
by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figures 1 and 2. Just for demonstration, the only selected morphological variants
of three different types of Q1D ZnO nanowires grown by the FTS approach
are presented here; however, growth of many other 1D structural variants
from ZnO is possible. The array of hexagonal Q1D ZnO nanowires (on
a Si substrate) is shown by SEM images at increasing magnifications
(left to right) in Figure 1a–c. The highest-magnification SEM image, corresponding
to a single nanorod in Figure 1c, clearly shows the hexagonally faceted morphology. The growth
of a dense array of regular ZnO nanowires by the FTS process is demonstrated
by the SEM images in Figure 1d–f at increasing magnifications (left to right). These
nanowires are almost uniform in dimension (length and diameter) and
cylindrical in shape (circular cross section). It is important to
emphasize here that mechanical integration of Q1D ZnO nano- and microwires
with Si has always been an issue, and different strategies (particular
crystal facets, adhesion promoters, surface roughness, etc.) have
been utilized. The FTS approach does not exhibit such requirements,
and well-integrated Q1D ZnO structures on Si surfaces can be easily
grown.35 For better visualization, side-view
SEM images (low and high magnification) corresponding to the growth
of a forest of 1D ZnO nanowires on a Si substrate by the FTS process
are shown in Figure 1g,i, respectively. It can be observed that these long ZnO nano- and
microwires are very well connected to the Si substrate and have a
highly dense array. The top-view SEM image (Figure 1i) reveals that some of the Q1D ZnO nanowires
in the “forest” exhibit small branches on their tips.

to high) of different Q1D ZnO nano- and microwires synthesized by
the FTS approach on Si substrates. (a–c) Homogeneous array

ZnO nano- and microwires with smooth surfaces. (g–i) Side-view
SEM images of a dense array of relatively longer (>200 μm
length)
Q1D ZnO nano- and microwires grown on a Si substrate. These Q1D ZnO
microwires are very well interconnected with the base and are almost
homogeneous in diameter (bottom to top) with a sharp needle-like tip
at their ends. The growth of smaller flower-like ZnO nanostructures
on their tips is mainly due to secondary growth (the denser array
of wires favors growth on the tips).

wires are grown after the FTS process. (b, c) Typical SEM images from
the synthesized Q1D ZnO nano- and microwires at low and high magnifications,

(a) and mounted on the E-PTP device. Representative SEM images (d–f)

device.

The crystallographic structure
and experimental arrangements play
a very important role for morphological evolutions of Q1D ZnO structures
in the FTS approach. Owing to the hexagonal-wurtzite structure, ZnO
has three fast growth directions, [0001], [101̅0], and [21̅1̅0],
with growth rates (r) ranked in the order of r[0001] > r[011̅0] > r[0001̅].48,49 The (0001) facet is the least stable surface that facilitates easy
growth of Q1D ZnO structures, and their morphology (diameter, length,
surface quality, etc.) mainly depends upon the chosen synthesis technique
and experimental parameters.48,49 In the FTS approach
here, growth of Q1D ZnO nano- and microwires occurs via a solid–vapor–solid
process using an in-house cylindrically arranged ceramic in a furnace
at high temperature (∼900 °C) in the presence of O2, CO, and CO2 gases, which provide local control
over the growth conditions.43,48 The synthesis temperature
(∼900 °C) in the FTS approach leads to the sublimation
of the solid Zn microparticles (present in the precursor—Zn
+ PVB + ethanol mixture) into Zn atomic vapor, and the decomposition
of a sacrificial polymer [poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB)] facilitates the
availability of local control gases.48 ZnO
nucleation begins at the exposed surfaces of the mounted Si substrates,
followed by subsequent 1D growth. It has been observed that Q1D wires
in nano and submicron scales primarily grow on the main surface (facing
toward the precursor material)43 of the
Si substrates; however, longer Q1D wires (from the submillimeter to
centimeter scale) grow on the cleaved surfaces (perpendicular to the
precursor mixture) of the substrates. The growth of longer Q1D ZnO
nanowires at the perpendicular edges is most likely attributed to:
(i) a faster nucleation process (due to the presence of defects during
cleavage of the Si wafer); and (ii) the greater availability of the
Zn and O atomic species. Further experiments using a bigger crucible
have also supported this assumption because the growth of subcentimeter-long
nano- and micro-wires on their periphery (inner surface) has also
been observed. It is important to mention here that utilization of
a silicon substrate is not at all a mandatory requirement; in fact,
ZnO nanowires can grow on the surface of large ZnO nano- and micro-structures
because of the surface defects.15,43,50 In the FTS approach, it is a self-controlled growth process in which
the pregrown ZnO structures serve as possible nucleation centers (due
to the existence of a large number of surface defects) for the growth
of 1D ZnO nanowires, for example, nanowire forests and branched structures,
etc.15,43,50,51 Therefore, for such applications, in which free-standing
nanowires are required, the simple crucible strategy in the FTS approach
(no need of any substrate) suits best because a large number of Q1D
ZnO nano- and microwires are directly grown on a pile, and they can
be easily harvested for desired utilizations (e.g., Figure 2a). Thus, by selecting appropriate
experimental conditions (precursor amount, temperature, time, substrate
location, etc.) in the FTS approach, various types of Q1D ZnO nano-
and microwires can be easily grown for desired utilizations.

As mentioned previously, the dimensions (diameter, length, etc.)
of the Q1D ZnO nanostructures play a crucial role with regard to their
integration in the form of nanoelectronic devices45 and in investigating their responses, especially in electromechanical
studies in which very strong and reliable interconnections are desired.
The larger the Q1D ZnO nanowires, the simpler and more free they are
from the aforementioned utilization complexities. Inspired with these
advantages, we were motivated to grow the ultralong Q1D ZnO nanowires
using the FTS approach. After varying the parameters (mixture of precursor
materials, internal arrangement), the growth of ultralong Q1D ZnO
wires (almost up to a centimeter) was successfully realized, as presented
in Figure 2a–c.
A lot of such ZnO nano- and microwires nicely grow from the big ZnO
base (digital photograph in Figure 2a), which can easily be harvested and used for any
desired applications. The SEM investigations on a typical ultralong
ZnO nanowire revealed that they exhibit hexagonal facets, mainly due
to the c axis growth nature of ZnO (Figure 2b,c). The most important aspects
are that even these ZnO nano- and microwires are very long in size,
they are perfectly single crystalline in nature,52,53 and they exhibit most of the desired nanoscale features, which make
them appropriate structures for building reliable nanoelectronic devices.

Some selected Q1D ZnO nanowires with sufficiently large lengths
(>20 μm) have been utilized for in situ electromechanical
studies
using an electrical push-to-pull (E-PTP) device (Bruker Nano Surfaces).
The E-PTP device was designed in such a way that it enables tensile
testing of individual nanowires with a high degree of precession while
simultaneously measuring the electrical properties.54 The sample preparation for the E-PTP device is demonstrated
in the SEM images (Figure 2d–f). To collect individual samples, the nanowires
were removed from the growth substrate and placed on a silicon substrate
(inset in Figure 2d).
Individual nanowires were then picked up by a nanowire of a manipulator
and placed on the E-PTP device (Figure 2d). A Pt-based gas injection system (GIS) was used
for mechanically securing the Q1D ZnO nanowires to the E-PTP device,
while also creating the electrical contacts with the electrical leads
of the system. To reduce Pt spreading over the nanowire, the Pt pads
were first deposited, followed by the Q1D ZnO nanowire placement (shown
by the high-magnification SEM image in Figure 2e). Figure 2f shows an overview of the E-PTP device with the integrated
electrical leads. When the movable part of the E-PTP is pushed with
an indentation system, the sample mounted across the 2.5 μm
gap experiences the applied tensile strain.

Figure 3 shows the
fabrication details of the E-PTP device, which consists of five layers.54 The top layer (gold ∼400 nm thick) is
used to make the electrical connections to the sample and to wire
bond the leads to a circuit board. The next layer (∼200 nm
SiO2) electrically isolates the gold leads and the silicon
device layer. The deep trenches on the device layer and the top oxide
layer isolate each electrode. The mechanical components, such as springs
and the movable electrode, are designed on the 10 μm thick device
layer. This device layer has been designed to be passively mobile
when pushed by the tip on the semicircular part. This device layer
has orders of magnitude higher stiffness in the lateral and out-of-plane
directions to restrict all motion to the uniaxial tensile direction.
This stiffness, characteristic for tensile testing, is achieved by
carefully designing the springs using a finite element analysis. The
1 μm silicon oxide layer insulates the device and the handle
layer. A 350 μm thick bottom layer is used to provide the necessary
strength to protect the device and specimen during handling. It is
very important to mention that the E-PTP device just facilitates simple
fabrication of the nanowire-based electronic device. However, for
electromechanical sensing, an additional transducer would be required,
which is a SEM PicoIndenter PI 85 in the present work.

Figure 3 Schematic of an E-PTP
device shows the dimensions and materials
in different layers.54

The mechanical responses of the ZnO nanowires measured using
the
E-PTP device are shown in Figure 4a,b. The load–displacement curves (under zero
electrical bias) obtained from the SEM PicoIndenter are given in Figure 4a. It is important
to note that the Q1D ZnO nanowire exhibits predominantly elastic behavior,
as expected, up to a displacement of ∼550 nm, followed by a
catastrophic fracture. True stress and true strain were determined
using the force–displacement data and plotted in Figure 4b. The actual force to the
Q1D ZnO nanowire was calculated by subtracting the E-PTP frame stiffness
from the experimentally measured load, measured here as 320 N/m. The
elastic modulus from the stress–strain curves was calculated
to be 82 ± 1.8 GPa. The reported values of the elastic modulus
of ZnO nanowires or nanobelts are widely scattered between 50 and
140 GPa.55 In this study, the nanowire
fractured at ∼5.9% strain, which is significantly higher than
the fracture strain of bulk ZnO (<1%). Hoffmann et al.56 and Chen and Zhu57 have also reported the fracture strain of ZnO nanowires to be 4–8
and 4–7%, respectively. As expected in the brittle fracture
of a ceramic material, no necking or evidence of ductility was observed
during the failure. The high fracture strain evidenced in the present
nanowire samples may be due to their crystalline nature in contrast
to a bulk sample.52,58 Because the fracture occurs by
crack nucleation from a defect, the probability of failure has been
significantly reduced simply due to the lower sampled volume. The
electromechanical behavior of the Q1D ZnO nanowires was then explored
in a separate set of experiments where a fixed bias voltage of 0.5
V was applied across the outer two contacts on the nanowire during
a tensile test. This enabled the measurement of the current as a function
of the strain. Figure 4c shows the stress–strain and resistance–strain curves
from such a test. The resistance was calculated assuming ohmic behavior.
A 2 kΩ decrease in the measured resistance was observed under
a corresponding strain of up to 5.5%.

Stress–strain and resistance–strain curves obtained
during tensile experiments of a Q1D ZnO nanowire. A constant voltage
of 0.5 V was applied during the test and the current was measured.

The detailed piezoresistive responses
from two individual Q1D ZnO
nanowires are presented in Figure 5. The inset in Figure 5a shows a schematic of a typical load function that
was used to conduct such experiments. Voltage sweeps of ±0.3
V were applied during the holding segments at different applied strain
values. The characteristic I–V curves shown in Figure 5a are linear and symmetric indicating ohmic behavior. Previous
studies have reported that such ohmic contacts of ZnO nanowires with
metal electrodes are possible, and the characteristic I–V curves were determined by the surface
condition, crystallinity, chemical reaction, and the work functions.59 The slopes of the I–V curves and sample dimensions were used to calculate the
resistivity of the nanowire material (sample 1), which is plotted
in Figure 5b. To understand
the variation in the resistivity under strain, E-PTP measurements
on a second Q1D ZnO nanowire (sample 2) were repeated under identical
conditions, and the corresponding values are plotted in Figure 5b. Both samples exhibit similar
electromechanical change, and the decrease in the resistivity values
were calculated to be 14.2 and 13.9% with a maximum applied strain
of ∼4.25 and 4.34%, respectively (Figure 5b). In most of the previous studies, the
gauge factor is mainly determined by bending a substrate and calculating
the corresponding strain60 or bending a
nanowire,23 which includes significant
theoretical approximations. The piezoresistance is defined as the
change of the resistance under applied strain and is described by
a gauge factor (G) in eq 1 1  Precise measurements of the gauge factor offer
a much more realistic way to understand the actual response of a piezoresistive
device. The control of the applied strain using the SEM PicoIndenter
equipped with the E-PTP device, as shown in this study, provides a
very precise measurement of the gauge factors and hence a better accuracy,
in contrast to the conventional bending methods used previously in
the literature.60 For both Q1D ZnO nanowires,
as shown in Figure 5b, the average gauge factor values are −3.26 and −3.32.
The small variation in the obtained values (<2%) shows the excellent
reproducibility of the electromechanical measurements on Q1D ZnO nanowires
using the E-PTP device.

Figure 5 (a) I–V characteristic
curves obtained from a 1D ZnO nanowire 1 showing the change in slope
with applied strain. (b) Resistivity vs strain curve showing a decrease
in the electrical resistivity of 14.2% in sample 1 and 13.9% in sample
2.

To elucidate the piezoresistive
behavior, a constant strain of
4.25% was adjusted to the Q1D ZnO nanowire (sample 1) while a rectangular
potential of 0–2.4 V was applied. Under fixed strain, the internal
stress developed in the Q1D ZnO nanowire caused by the variation in
the applied voltage was measured as a change of the closed loop force
required to maintain the constant strain. This variation in the internal
stress with respect to the applied voltage is shown in Figure 6. Although the stress change
(Δσ) due to the voltage variation is found to be similar
in the segments, a stress relaxation can certainly be observed during
the hold period. This observed stress relaxation could be attributed
to several factors, such as migration of point defects, surface reconstructions,
a variation in the carrier electron density at the surfaces, or an
interplay between the inner core and surface contributions of the
stressed Q1D ZnO nano- and microwires.61−66 Different types of defects in ZnO nanowires exhibit a variety of
diffusivities under stress, resulting in significant inelastic strain
behavior and thus an instantaneous stress relaxation,61,67 which is most likely the case in the present observations. The results
in this study demonstrate that the applied tensile strain can considerably
enhance the electrical conductivity of the Q1D ZnO nanowires. It has
been reported that a bent ZnO nanowire displays the opposite behavior,
that is, the conductivity decreases with an increase in strain.29 However, in the case of bending, the layers
at the outer and inner arc surfaces of a bent Q1D ZnO nanowire produce
positively and negatively charged surfaces, respectively (Supporting
Information, Figure S1).68,69 As described by Yang et al., the charges are considered as immobile
ionic charges, creating an electric field across the width of the
ZnO nanowires.29 This local electrical
field across the width of a ZnO nanowire traps electrons, causing
the decrease in the total electron concentration and hence mobility
along the length direction. In contrast, a ZnO nanowire strained in
pure tension enhances the electron concentration and mobility.68

Figure 6 Variation in stress in the Q1D nanowire under periodic
potentials.

Defects play an important
role in different properties, and an
accurate defect handling/modeling is still a debatable issue.21,66,67 Although the utilized Q1D ZnO
nanowires are single crystalline in nature, they exhibit lots of intrinsic
defects, including unavoidable surface defects, which definitely impact
the observed electromechanical piezoresistive response in the present
work. For a better understanding, the finite element method (FEM)
simulations were performed using standard ZnO physical parameters
under identical experimental conditions as in the E-PTP. The preliminary
FEM (COMSOL Multiphysics) modeling observations nicely support the
experimental results in terms of periodic variations (current/stress)
under the application of periodic potentials and vice versa; however,
the stress values differ by certain factors. We currently address
this issue to the above-mentioned various kinds of defects, which
would need to be carefully considered during FEM simulations. For
more detailed mechanistic insights, a comparative study with both
the experimental and FEM simulation studies needs to be performed
on a set of Q1D ZnO nanowire dimensions, under different experimental
conditions. This is planned as a detailed future study. Such studies
would be of interest for a large number of material engineering communities,
and they will also facilitate potential applications involving strain
engineering. Depending upon the conditions, the amount and the nature
of the strain, the bandgap of the Q1D nanostructured materials can
be tuned, implicating technological importance for various advanced
electronic devices, including piezoresistive/piezotronic transistors
and other self-powered electronic appliances. In the conventional
field effect transistor, an electrical potential is applied between
the device’s source and drain to create an electrical field,
which controls the current flow. In the piezotronic transistors, current
flow can be controlled by changing the conductivity of the nanostructure
material by just bending or stretching. This study shows that nanowire
stretching can change the conductivity and thus can be used as a “gate
potential” in related electronic devices, in which the amount
of gate potential is directly related to the amount of applied tensile
strain.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated
here the successful growth of
ultralong Q1D free-standing ZnO nano- and microwires by a single-step
flame transport process. Because this process is flexible with respect
to the dimensions of the synthesized structures, these nano- and microwires
can be easily integrated into reliable devices designed for a wide
variety of intended applications. Here, we have made an attempt to
understand the effect of the piezoresistance behavior of the Q1D ZnO
nanowires using an E-PTP device in conjunction with an in situ SEM
indentation system. These Q1D ZnO nanowires were electrically mounted
on E-PTP devices, and their detailed electromechanical responses were
measured in situ. The electromechanical results revealed that the
electrical conductivity of the Q1D ZnO nanowires increased significantly
with an applied tensile strain. The observed periodic variations in
stress with respect to the applied periodic potentials on the prestressed
Q1D ZnO nanowire confirmed the piezoresistive effect from the Q1D
ZnO nanowires. Defect relaxations play a very important role on the
piezoresistive response of ZnO, which has been discussed in detail
here. The characteristics of these Q1D ZnO nano- and microwires under
applied strain could be useful for various electronic, energy-harvesting,
stress-sensing, self-powered devices, and other advanced technological
applications.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Synthesis of Q1D ZnO Nanowires
Q1D
ZnO nano- and microwires were grown by the FTS approach using Zn microparticles
(diameter <10 μm, 99.5%, Goodfellow, U.K.), PVB sacrificial
polymer powder (Kuraray GmbH, Europe), and ethanol in a single-step
process inside a simple muffle-type furnace.35,43,48,70 A homogeneous
mixture [Zn:(PVB:ethanol)::1:2(1:2)] in the form of a slurry is used
as the precursor material. An in-house ceramic cylindrical setup (inner
diameter 55 mm, height around 55 mm) was inserted inside the furnace
to achieve the local control on Zn vapor (upward flow only) inside
the furnace. The precursor material is mounted at the bottom of the
cylinder, and the growth of arrays of Q1D ZnO nano- and microwires
takes place on the Si substrates mounted on the top (with the help
of a ceramic cover). For the nanowire array growth, the temperature
is generally varied from 850 to 950 °C for a time span of 30
min to 4 h. Lower temperature/growth durations are preferable for
thinner nanowire arrays; however, higher temperatures and durations
yield thicker and longer Q1D nano- and microwire arrays. For exceptionally
long (centimeter scale) Q1D ZnO wires, a different top cover arrangement
is utilized (thin ceramic strips are mounted along the diameter of
the cylinder), and Si strips are placed on the top of the ceramic
strip (the ceramic strip role is to support the Si substrates). The
whole cylindrical arrangement is inserted in the furnace, which is
then rapidly heated to 900 °C and maintained for a couple of
hours (1–2 h, depending upon the requirements). After the process,
the growth of ZnO nanowires occurs on the edges of the Si strips as
well as on the top. The FTS growth process only requires a simple
muffle-type oven, and the synthesis has been carried out in normal
air atmosphere. The recent experiment suggests that the growth of
Q1D ZnO nano- and micro-structures is possible directly by the use
of a large cylindrical ceramic crucible (without cylindrical arrangement)
filled with a Zn/PVB mixture in the ratio of 1:2. However, the observations
suggest that the cylinder approach offers much more control in comparison
to the crucible-only approach. After growth, a few Q1D ZnO nanowires
with a diameter 0.3–0.4 μm and length 20 μm were
carefully harvested and utilized for the desired electromechanical
experiments.

4.2 Characterizations
The morphology
of the grown ZnO nano- and microwires was characterized by a Zeiss
Ultraplus (5 kV, 15 μA) SEM machine at the Kiel University,
and afterward, they were transported to Hysitron, Inc. for in situ
E-PTP studies. The ZnO nanowire was mounted on the E-PTP device with
the help of a nanomanipulator inside a dual-beam SEM-FIB machine.
The E-PTP device was used only for mounting the nanowire sample and
to pass the current across it. A commercially available transducer
was used with the system (SEM PicoIndenter PI 85; Bruker Nano Surfaces,
Minneapolis, MN), which controls actuation and sensing. The Pt-based
GIS was used to weld Q1D ZnO nanowires, and the contacts were connected
with electrical leads outside. The in situ electromechanical studies
were performed by the PI 85 nanomechanical instrument (Bruker Nano
Surfaces Division) inside a field emission SEM. A direct current source
meter was used to apply and measure the current and voltage. To obtain
electrical properties as a function of strain, the nanowires were
stretched to different lengths and voltage sweeps were applied at
fixed strains. To understand the piezoresistive behavior, periodic
voltages were applied across the length of the Q1D nanowires and the
corresponding stresses were measured.
