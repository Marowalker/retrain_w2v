We report a new method
to quantify the affinity of small molecules
for proteins. This method is based on Förster resonance energy
transfer (FRET) between endogenous tryptophan (Trp) residues and the
coumarin-derived fluorophore Pacific Blue (PB). Tryptophan residues
are frequently found in proteins near ligand-binding sites, making
this approach potentially applicable to a wide range of systems. To
improve access to PB, we developed a scalable multigram synthesis
of this fluorophore, starting with inexpensive 2,3,4,5-tetrafluorobenzoic
acid. This route was used to synthesize fluorescent derivatives of
biotin, as well as lower affinity thiobiotin, iminobiotin, and imidazolidinethione
analogues that bind the protein streptavidin. Compared with previously
published FRET acceptors for tryptophan, PB proved to be superior
in both sensitivity and efficiency. These unique properties of PB
enabled direct quantification of dissociation constants (Kd) as well as competitive inhibition constants (Ki) in the micromolar to nanomolar range. In
comparison to analogous binding studies using fluorescence polarization,
fluorescence quenching, or fluorescence enhancement, affinities determined
using Trp-FRET were more precise and accurate as validated using independent
isothermal titration calorimetry studies. FRET between tryptophan
and PB represents a new tool for the characterization of protein–ligand
complexes.

Introduction
To quantify the affinity
of small molecules for proteins, a wide
variety of biophysical techniques have been developed. Homogeneous
methods include isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),1 fluorescence quenching or enhancement,2 fluorescence polarization (FP),3 and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).4 Although these techniques are powerful, each
has limitations. ITC, considered the gold standard for affinity determination,
is material-intensive and low-throughput and requires an appreciable
change in heat upon binding. In the widely employed FP (or the related
fluorescence anisotropy),3,5 small molecules linked
to fluorophores report changes in the polarization of emitted photons
when a rapidly rotating small molecule binds a slowly tumbling protein.
However, probe size, solvent viscosity, fluorescence quenching, and
linker flexibility can limit the applicability.3

FRET has the potential to overcome some of these
limitations. This
method involves nonradiative transfer of excitation (Ex.) energy from
a donor fluorophore to a proximal acceptor fluorophore.4 This transfer is highly distance-dependent, with
an efficiency of 50% at the Förster distance (R0, typically <∼5 nm). FRET-based binding assays
generally involve one fluorophore attached to a receptor of interest
and another fluorophore conjugated to a ligand. However, this requirement
for two exogenous fluorophores poses challenges, given that conjugation
of fluorophores to proteins can result in heterogeneity, or requires
site-directed labeling reactions.

As an alternative method for
detection of small molecule–protein
interactions, FRET initiated by the excitation of intrinsically fluorescent
tryptophan (Trp, 1, Figure 1) residues is of increasing interest.6−8 Beneficially, these residues are commonly found in or near protein–ligand
binding sites and at interfaces between proteins and other biomolecules.9,10 Although maximally excited at 280 nm, tryptophan can be selectively
excited over tyrosine at 295 nm. Fluorescent photons emitted by tryptophan
exhibit λmax values that range from ∼308 to
∼355 nm, roughly correlated with exposure to an aqueous solution,11 typically with a modest quantum yield (Φ
≈ 0.2). A previously reported11 comparison
of 19 tryptophan residues from 17 proteins with experimentally determined
structures revealed an average λmax of tryptophan
emission of 333 nm. Because the emission λmax and
the quantum yield of tryptophan are affected by the polarity of the
local environment,12 its environmental
sensitivity and quenching by exogenous factors have been widely used
to study changes in protein conformation and binding of ligands. The
intrinsic emission of tryptophan can also participate in FRET with
other fluorophores,7 and this approach
has been extensively used to study protein folding and dynamics.13−15 Fluorophores known to participate in FRET with tryptophan include
derivatives of dansyl (2), 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC, 3), and 7-dimethylaminocoumarin (DMACA, 4).4 Coumarins 3 and 4 have
recently been reported6 by Chung to be
the best FRET acceptors for tryptophan identified to date. However,
the photophysical properties of coumarin 3 are highly
sensitive to changes in pH in the physiological range (phenol pKa = 7.8),16,17 and the absorbance18 and emission19 of
coumarin 4 shift substantially when transitioning from
an aqueous to a hydrophobic environment. Moreover, a biotin-linked
derivative of coumarin 4 was reported to have a low quantum
yield (Φ = 0.06),6 which increases
the concentration of the probe required for detection. These environmental
effects, limited brightness, and low FRET efficiencies continue to
hinder sensitivity for Trp-FRET applications. A few noncompetitive
binding assays using Trp-FRET have been reported,20−23 but they generally involve quenching
of tryptophan fluorescence or require high concentrations of fluorescent
probes for detection. These high concentrations can prevent quantitative
measurements of low dissociation constants (Kd) and competitive inhibition constants (Ki), which are frequently observed between small molecules
and proteins.

Results and Discussion
To identify a more sensitive FRET
acceptor for tryptophan, we examined
the overlap between the emission spectrum of this amino acid (Ex.
280 nm, Em. ∼ 350 nm, ε = 5600 M–1 cm–1) and the absorbance spectrum of 6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxycoumarin,
a fluorophore known as Pacific Blue (PB, 5).17 Because of its favorable photophysical properties
(Ex. 400 nm, Em. 447 nm, ε = 29 500 M–1 cm–1, Φ = 0.75, and phenol pKa = 3.7), PB is of substantial interest for labeling of
proteins and other biomolecules.24,25 As shown in Figure 2, the large overlap
between the emission of tryptophan and the absorption of PB suggested
that this fluorophore might be a particularly sensitive FRET partner.
To investigate this hypothesis, we developed an improved synthesis
of PB that readily allows access to gram quantities of this compound
(Scheme 1). In contrast
to previously reported routes based on expensive 2,4-difluororesorcinol,17,26 we found that the relatively inexpensive 2,3,4,5-tetrafluorobenzoic
acid can be converted to the common intermediate aldehyde 10(17,26) in 66% overall yield in a four-pot process.

critical for FRET, is shaded gray.

Scheme 1 Improved Gram-Scale Synthesis of the PB Fluorophore
As a model small molecule–protein
interaction, we investigated
binding of the bacterial protein streptavidin (SA) to biotin and analogues.
This tetrameric protein binds biotin with exceptionally high affinity
(Kd = 10–14 M–1),27 and X-ray crystallography28 has revealed six tryptophan residues in close
proximity to each of its four noncooperative29 biotin-binding sites. Additionally, Trp79, Trp108, and Trp120 are
critical for binding of SA to biotin via van der Waals and hydrophobic
interactions.28,30 Moreover, in a buffered aqueous
solution, excitation of these tryptophan residues leads to an average
emission λmax of 336 nm that can initiate FRET with
biotinylated fluorophores.20,31,32 Correspondingly, docking33 of this X-ray
structure (Figure 3) to PB-biotin derivative 12 (Figure 4, panel A) supported the notion that binding
of SA would favorably position the fluorophore in close proximity
to endogenous tryptophan residues that make noncovalent contacts to
biotin and tryptophan residues in other subunits of the SA tetramer.

are shown as CPK models. The distance between the most proximal Trp120
(marked) and the PB moiety of 12 is ∼11 Å.
For clarity, only one bound ligand is shown.

(Fluor.) emission (Em., dashed lines) spectra of 12–15 (32 μM for Abs., 50 nM for Fluor.) in PBS (pH 7.4). Fluorophores 12–15 were excited at their λmax [405
nm (12), 330 nm (13), 375 nm (14), and 390 nm (15)]. Intensities are % of λmax of 12. (C) Analysis of Trp-FRET upon binding
of 12–15 (100 nM) to SA ([monomer] = 400 nM).
Ex. of SA (295 nm) results in maximal Em. at 340 nm. After binding
of 12–15, FRET Em. was observed at 457 (12), 532 (13), 467 (14), and 475
nm (15). Addition of biotin (10 μM) blocked FRET
from 12, confirming specificity.

To compare PB (5) with known Trp-FRET acceptors
(2–4), we synthesized biotin derivatives 12–15 (Figure 4, panel
A). Comparison of normalized absorbance and emission spectra of these
compounds (Figure 4, panel B) revealed that the PB-derived probe 12 was
∼3-fold brighter than 14, ∼17-fold brighter
than 15, and more than 100-fold brighter than 13 in aqueous PBS (pH 7.4). FRET can be measured as the relative fluorescence
intensity of the donor in the absence (Id) and presence (Ida) of the acceptor.4 When probes 12–15 were added
to SA, excitation of tryptophan revealed substantial differences in
emission because of FRET (Figure 4, panel C). As listed in Table 1, values from these studies were used to
analyze the sensitivity (Iad), efficiency
(E), and other properties of these fluorophore pairs.
Compared with PB (12), dansyl (13) was 33-fold
less sensitive, 7HC (14) was 1.5-fold less sensitive,
and DMACA (15) was 6-fold less sensitive. Additionally,
the blue-shifted absorbance of 7HC (14) increased its
excitation at 295 nm, reducing its FRET fold effect (FF) by a factor
of 4. The specificity of the FRET signal of 12 upon binding
to SA was confirmed by addition of biotin as a competitor (Figure 4, panel C). Consequently,
PB proved to be the most efficient and sensitive FRET acceptor for
tryptophan under these conditions.

a The intensity (Iad) of FRET acceptors (100 nM) was measured at Em. λmax when bound to SA (400 nM, Ex. 295 nm) and normalized to Id. The efficiency (E) of FRET
with tryptophan when bound to SA was calculated as E = 1 – Ida/Id. FF was calculated as FF = Iad/Ia. R0 is
the theoretical Förster distance calculated for each Trp-acceptor
pair as described in the Experimental Section. Ida = intensity of Em. of tryptophan
(340 nm) in the presence of the acceptor. Id = intensity of Em. of tryptophan (340 nm) in the absence of the
acceptor. Iad and Ia are the intensities of Em. of the acceptor [457 (12), 532 (13), 467 (14), and 475 nm (15)] in the presence and absence of the donor (SA), respectively.
Values for Φf and molar extinction coefficients (ε)
were measured as described in the Experimental Section and Supporting Information.

Biotin binds SA with such high affinity
that its association is
essentially irreversible. To investigate fluorescent analogues with
lower affinity that might be suitable for equilibrium binding measurements,
we synthesized probes 16–18 (Figure 5, panel A).34,35 To generate equilibrium binding curves, SA was titrated into a low
fixed concentration of the fluorescent probe (below Kd), followed by excitation of tryptophan at 295 nm to
trigger FRET (measured at 460 nm). Curve fitting was used to calculate
the Kd values of 11 ± 2 nM for thiobiotin-PB
derivative 17, 145 ± 19 nM for imidazolidinethione-PB 18, and 2730 ± 340 nM for iminobiotin-PB 16 in PBS (Figure 5,
panel B). These values were in excellent agreement with the independent
assessments of Kd using ITC under the
same conditions (12 ± 4 nM for 17 and 125 ±
45 nM for 18, Figure 5, panels C and D). For these high affinity probes,
attempts to measure affinities by FP were unsuccessful because of
fluorescence quenching, which affects the lifetime of the fluorophore.3 However, using higher concentrations of the lower
affinity probe 16, FP yielded a comparable Kd value of 2950 ± 270 nM (data shown in Supporting Information).

(Kd) of SA for probes 16 (25

was measured at 460 nm. Values were corrected to account for fluorescence
quenching or enhancement upon binding, as described in Experimental Section. [SA] was based on monomeric protein.
Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated
using a one-site binding model (GraphPad Prism 6.0). (C,D) Quantification
of the binding of 17 (C) and 18 (D) to SA
in PBS (pH 7.4) using ITC. Thermodynamic parameters and Kd values were calculated with Origin software. For 17, [SA in sample cell] = 4 μM and [17 in
syringe] = 50 μM. For 18, [SA in sample cell] =
10 μM and [18 in syringe] = 150 μM.

We hypothesized that the high
sensitivity of Trp-FRET with PB might
be particularly valuable for quantifying small molecule–protein
interactions in a competition assay format. To test this approach,
we measured competitive inhibition constants (Ki) of the unlabeled biotin analogues 19–22 (Figure 6, panel
A) using PB-imidazolidinethione 18 as a fluorescent probe.
The unlabeled ligands 19–22 were added to SA (held
at a concentration near the Kd) bound
to 18 (held below Kd, 25
nM). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature to achieve equilibrium,
excitation of tryptophan at 295 nm was used to trigger FRET (measured
at 460 nm). This approach allowed the calculation of Ki values of 188 ± 25 nM for the benzyl ester imidazolidinethione
derivative 22, 693 ± 91 nM for the methyl ester
imidazolidinethione 21, 1350 ± 180 nM for imidazolidinethione 20, and 44 600 ± 5800 nM for iminobiotin 19 in PBS (Figure 6, panel B) by nonlinear curve fitting. Moreover, we independently
measured the affinity of the nonfluorescent imidazolidinethione analogue 20 for SA using ITC (Kd = 1550
± 270 nM, Figure 6, panel C), which was in excellent agreement with the Ki quantified by Trp-FRET. Other previously published studies36,37 of 19 have reported values similar to the Ki value measured by Trp-FRET.

analogues of biotin (19–22) used in competition
binding assays. (B) Quantification of competitive
inhibitory constants (Ki) of 19–22 for SA complexed with 18 (175 nM for SA and 25 nM for 18) by Trp-FRET. Tryptophan residues were excited at 295 nM,
and FRET was measured at 460 nm. Values were corrected to account
for fluorescence quenching upon binding as described in Experimental Section. [SA] was based on monomeric protein.
Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were calculated
using a log(inhibitor) vs response model (GraphPad Prism 6.0), and
IC50 values were converted to Ki values. (C) Evaluation of direct binding of 20 to SA
using ITC. Compound 20 was titrated into [SA] in PBS
(pH 7.4), and thermodynamic parameters and Kd values were calculated using the Origin software. [SA in
sample cell] = 20 μM and [20 in syringe] = 250
μM.

When PB-linked ligands bind to
SA, their fluorescence is partially
quenched (16, 17) or enhanced (18). Hence, simple changes in fluorescence could potentially allow
determination of their affinities for this protein. To examine the
merits of this approach, we quantified the Kd of 16–18 for SA using only fluorescence
quenching or enhancement, and we examined changes in fluorescence
upon addition of the nonfluorescent competitor 20 to
SA-18. As shown in Figure 7, we found that simple fluorescence quenching or enhancement
could be used to estimate the affinity of 16–18 for SA, but Kd values obtained using
this method differed by twofold (18) to sixfold (17) from gold-standard measurements using ITC. Moreover, examination
of competitive binding of 20 to SA-18 revealed
substantial deviation from the binding model at high concentrations
(Figure 7, panel D),
which prevented accurate determination of Ki. This lower accuracy and precision associated with the sole use
of the fluorescence intensity presumably arises from its high sensitivity
to aggregation of fluorophores and other environmental factors. In
contrast, the dependence of FRET on the distance between fluorophores
presumably reduces its susceptibility to these confounding factors.
On the basis of these results, we conclude that Trp-FRET with PB is
superior to fluorescence intensity measurements for quantifying equilibrium
binding in this system.

resulting from competition of 20 for SA bound to probe 18 (25 nM). In (D), because of the poor fit to the binding
model, the Ki value was not calculated.

In conclusion, we developed an
improved synthesis of the PB fluorophore
starting from inexpensive 2,3,4,5-tetrafluorobenzoic acid. This synthesis
was used to prepare fluorescent molecular probes that bind the Trp-containing
protein SA. Comparison with other fluorescent probes that bind SA
revealed that PB is a highly sensitive and efficient FRET acceptor
for tryptophan. This high sensitivity enabled quantification of Kd and competitive Ki values into the nM range. As validated using independent ITC measurements,
this method proved to be more precise and accurate than analogous
binding studies using fluorescence polarization, fluorescence quenching,
or fluorescence enhancement for this system. FRET between tryptophan
and PB offers a new method for quantification of small molecule–protein
interactions.

All nonaqueous reactions were carried out using flame- or oven-dried
glassware under an atmosphere of dry argon or nitrogen. Tetrahydrofuran
(THF), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and methanol (CH3OH) were purified via filtration through two columns of activated
basic alumina under an atmosphere of Ar using a solvent purification
system from Pure Process Technology (GlassContour). Other commercial
reagents were used as received unless otherwise noted. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR, and 19F NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX-400 or an Avance
AVIII 500 MHz instrument. For 1H and 13C, chemical

ppm for 1H, 39.5 ppm for 13C). For 19F, chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm referenced to trifluoroethanol
(−77.0 ppm for 19F). 1H coupling constants
(JHH, Hz), 13C coupling constants

Laboratory at the University of Kansas on a Micromass LCT Premier.
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using EMD aluminum-backed
(0.20 mm) silica plates (60 F-254), and flash chromatography used
ICN silica gel (200–400 mesh). TLC plates were visualized with
a UV lamp or by staining with I2. Preparative high-performance

mixture was stirred at 22 °C for 16 h while venting to the atmosphere
to allow escape of evolved gases. The solvent was removed under reduced

Assays of Binding of Small
Molecules to SA
SA protein
from Streptomyces avidinii(lyophilized
powder) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Absorbance spectra and measurements
of molar extinction coefficients (ε) were generated using semimicro
(1.4 mL) UV quartz cuvettes (Sigma-Aldrich, Z27667-7) on an Agilent
8452A diode array spectrometer. All optical spectroscopy and protein-binding
assays were conducted in PBS (10 mM Na2HPO4,
137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1.8 mM KH2PO4,
pH 7.4), unless otherwise noted. Molar extinction coefficients were
determined in PBS (0.5% DMSO) and were calculated from Beer’s
Law plots of absorbance λmax versus concentration,
as shown in Figure S1. Linear least-squares
fitting of the data (including a zero intercept) was used to determine
the slope (corresponding to ε). Values (M–1 cm–1) were calculated as follows: absorbance =
ε[concentration(M)]L, where L = 1 cm. SA concentrations were quantified using UV absorbance at
280 nm based on its calculated molar extinction coefficient (εmonomer = 41 326 M–1 cm–1) using a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer. All
fluorescence spectra were acquired using a SUPRASIL ultra-micro quartz
cuvette (PerkinElmer, B0631079) on a Perkin-Elmer LS55 fluorescence
spectrometer (10 nm excitation and emission slit widths). Relative
quantum yields (Φ) in PBS were determined by the Williams’
method.41 In brief, fluorophores were excited
at 396 nm and the integrated fluorescence emission (415–700
nm) was quantified (concentrations of 5–160 nM). Coumarin 102
(Φ = 0.66 in water) provided the standard.42 The integrated fluorescence emission at a given concentration
was plotted against the maximum absorbance of the sample at that concentration,
determined by extrapolation based on absorbance measurements at higher
concentrations, as shown in Figure S1.
Linear least-squares fitting of the data (including a zero intercept)
was used to calculate the slope, which is proportional to the quantum
yield. Quantum yields were calculated as follows: Φx = Φst(Gradx/Gradst), where Φst represents
the quantum yield of the standard, Φx represents the quantum yield of the unknown, and Grad is the slope
of the best linear fit. Theoretical Förster distances were
calculated using a previously described protocol.43,44 The following parameters and equations were used: ΦD is the quantum yield of the donor, η is the refractive index
of the solvent, κ is the orientation factor, J is the degree of spectral overlap between the donor and the acceptor, FD(λ) is the normalized donor fluorescence
intensity, and εA(λ) is the absorbance spectrum
of the acceptor normalized to its maximum molar extinction coefficient.    Theoretical
Förster distances were
calculated using the PhotoChemCAD software, and the measured extinction
coefficient for each probe were Φtryptophan = 0.2,
ηphosphate buffer, pH 7.4 = 1.33,
and κ = 2/3.

Determination of Kd Values Using
FRET, Fluorescence Enhancement, and Fluorescence Quenching
Different concentrations of SA protein, chosen to span a range of
at least 20–80% complexation, were incubated with fixed concentrations
of 16 (25 nM), 17 (5 nM), or 18 (25 nM) in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature with shaking for 1 h.
These fixed probe concentrations were chosen to be substantially below
the predicted Kd values to assure equilibrium
binding measurements. Averages of three measurements of raw FRET values
(I295, λex = 295 nm,
and λem = 460 nm) and fluorescence intensity values
(I400, λex = 400 nm,
λem = 460 nm) were recorded for each sample using
a Perkin-Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer. These raw FRET values
were corrected (Iad), and changes in fluorescence
were corrected (Iad,400) by subtracting
background signals and factoring in quenching or enhancement of the
fluorescence of PB upon binding as follows: averages of raw FRET (Id,295) values and averages of the fluorescence
(Id,400) intensity of SA alone (background
fluorescence) were calculated for each concentration of SA. Additionally,
the average emission at 460 nm from three measurements of the free
PB ligand (16–18 for direct binding and 18 for competition binding) in the PBS buffer upon excitation
at 295 (Ia,295) and 400 nm (Ia,400) was calculated. Background-subtracted FRET (IFRET), fluorescence (Iad,400), and the quenching ratio (Qr) were calculated as      Background-subtracted
FRET values (IFRET) were processed to
directly factor in quenching
or enhancement of fluorescence using the following equation, where Iad is the corrected FRET signal  

To calculate the dissociation
constants
(Kd) using FRET (Figure 5), corrected FRET values (Iad), run in triplicate, were plotted against the concentration
of SA (monomer) and a one-site-specific binding model (GraphPad Prism
6.0) was used for curve fitting.

To calculate the dissociation
constants (Kd) from simple enhancement
or quenching of fluorescence (Figure 7), the change in
fluorescence (enhancement or quenching, Iad,400) was normalized and plotted against the concentration of SA (monomer).
The experiments were run in triplicate, and a one-site-specific binding
model (GraphPad Prism 6.0) was used for curve fitting. For 17, the fluorescence intensity values for the three highest concentrations
of the SA monomer (64, 128, and 256 nM) were excluded from the analysis
to allow fitting of the one-site-specific binding model.

Determination
of Ki Values (Loss
of Trp-FRET from Competitive Binding)
The unlabeled ligand
was added to a fixed concentration of SA and fluorescent probe 18 (SA = 175 nM, 18 = 25 nM) in PBS (pH 7.4)
precomplexed by incubation at room temperature with shaking for 1
h. The concentration of SA was chosen to be close to the Kd value measured for the fluorescent probe, and the concentration
of 18 was chosen to be substantially below Kd to assure equilibrium binding. Measurements of raw FRET
values (I295, λex = 295
nm, λem = 460 nm) and fluorescence intensity values
(I400, λex = 400 nm,
λem = 460 nm) were recorded for each sample using
a Perkin-Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer. Background subtraction
and quenching were factored into each fluorescence measurement to
calculate the corrected FRET signal (Iad) as described previously. To calculate IC50 values, the
corrected FRET signal (Iad) was plotted
against the concentration of the unlabeled ligand. The experiments
were run in triplicate, and the log(inhibitor) versus response model
(GraphPad Prism 6.0) was used for curve fitting. Inhibitory constants
(Ki) were calculated as  

ITC
ITC experiments
were performed using a MicroCal
Auto-Isothermal Titration Calorimeter with protein and ligand solutions
prepared in PBS. Titrations were performed at 25 °C and consisted
of 25 injections (10 μL) of the ligand (50–250 μM)
into SA (1.46 mL, 4–20 μM), with 6 min between injections.
The experimental data were fit to a one-site binding model (the Origin
software), where ΔH (enthalpy change, kcal/mol), Ka (association constant, M–1), and n (number of binding sites) were variables.

Determination of Kd Values by FP
of PB
Fluorescence polarization is very sensitive to fluorescence
quenching because of the effects on the lifetime of the fluorophore.
This quenching prevented attempts to use FP to independently quantify
the affinity of ligands 17 and 18 for SA.3 However, quenching was less significant for the
lower affinity ligand 16, and a previously described45 FP method was used to independently analyze
this probe. Measurements of fluorescence intensity (I400, λex = 400 nm, λem = 460 nm) and fluorescence polarization (P, λex = 400 nm, λem = 460 nm) were recorded for
each sample using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer. Background
subtraction and quenching were factored into each fluorescence measurement
to calculate the corrected fraction bound (fa), as described in the Supporting Information. To calculate the dissociation constant (Kd), the corrected fraction bound was plotted against the concentration
of SA, and a one-site-specific binding model (GraphPad Prism 6.0)
was used for curve fitting (Figure S2).
