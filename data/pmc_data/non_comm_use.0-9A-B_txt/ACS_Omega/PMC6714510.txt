We
show that many complex gold nanostructures such as the water
chestnut, dog bone, nanobar, and octahedron, which are not easily
accessible via a direct seed-growth synthesis approach, can be prepared
via overgrowth of the same gold nanorods by varying pH and Ag concentrations
in the growth solution. Overgrown nanostructures’ shapes were
determined by the rate of gold atom deposition, which is faster at
higher pH. In the presence of AgNO3, codeposition of gold
and silver atoms affects the shapes of overgrown nanostructures, particularly
at high pH.

Introduction
Gold nanoparticles
are known for their original optical, electronic,
and catalytic properties, which differ from those of the bulk metal.1 Such properties arise from the collective oscillation
modes of their conduction electrons. These oscillation modes are known
as surface plasmons.1,2 For small spherical nanoparticles
(diameters below 50 nm), plasmon resonance happens at ∼530
nm, and the resonance is nearly independent of its size. For elongated
particles such as nanorods, electron oscillations can happen either
along the principal axis or perpendicular to it, producing two different
plasmonic modes, longitudinal and transverse plasmon.3 Longitudinal plasmon resonance can be tuned over a broad
spectral range from visible to NIR wavelengths by carefully controlling
the aspect ratio of a nanorod.4

Recent
advances in wet-chemical nanoparticle synthesis have significantly
improved our ability to tune plasmonic properties of gold nanoparticles.
Many different nanoparticle shapes with their plasmon resonance tuned
over the entire visible and NIR spectral range have been synthesized.5 Typically, a seed-mediated nanocrystal growth
method is preferred since it provides robust control over nanoparticles’
size and/or shapes under mild experimental conditions.6−9 Many different nanoparticle shapes such as the sphere, rod, cube,
triangular prism, and nanostar have been synthesized by varying concentrations
of silver nitrate, ascorbic acid, halide ions, and surfactants.6,10−22

Controlled overgrowth of already synthesized nanoparticles
provides
an alternate method for tuning the nanoparticle’s geometry
and optical properties.23 In this method,
already synthesized nanoparticles are used as seeds for further growth.
Many different nanostructures, which are not easily accessible via
the original seed-growth method, such as nanodogbones,24−26 nanodumbbells,25,26 arrowheads,25,27 octahedrons,26,28,29and nanobars30 can be synthesized by overgrowing
already synthesized nanoparticles by varying chemical parameters of
the growth medium. Formation of these different geometries is driven
by thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.31 Surface capping agents are known to chemisorb to a particular facet
of the growing nanocrystals thereby reducing the surface free energy
of that particular facet.31−33 They also hinder the deposition
of atoms onto these facets and hence allow the incoming atoms to deposit
on the other facets, which are either free or have less coverage from
the capping agent. Similarly, foreign ions such as Ag+,
Cu+, I–, Br–, etc.
may influence the growth mechanism by blocking some facets and thereby
facilitating growth from other facets.25,30 Reaction kinetics
also plays an important role in determining the final shapes of overgrown
nanoparticles.31 Atoms are initially deposited
on high-energy facets and then migrate to thermodynamically more stable
low-energy facets. However, in the case of inadequate surface migration
of atoms, the nanoparticle may be trapped in a thermodynamically unfavorable
geometry leading to the formation of kinetically controlled products.
For such products, overgrown nanoparticle shapes are determined by
the rates of atom deposition and surface migration. Various experimental
methods have been developed to carefully tune these rates to prepare
various kinetically controlled geometries. Zhang et al. have varied
the concentration of one of the reactants among silver nitrate, ascorbic
acid, or CTAB while keeping all other parameters same to get shapes
like the dog bone, arrow-headed NRs (AHNR), and many other intermediate
structures.25 Khlebtsov et al. had used
a binary surfactant and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent to show
that slow growth of gold nanorods leads to the formation of cigar-like
nanorods, whereas faster growth leads to the formation of dogbones.34

Here, we show that various kinetically
controlled nanostructure
geometries such as the water chestnut, dog bone, nanobar, icosahedron,
and octahedron can be formed by overgrowing gold nanorods at different
pH values of the growth medium. Our method utilizes the pH-dependent
reduction potential of hydroquinone. At high pH (pH ≥ 4), fast
deposition of gold atoms leads to the formation of kinetically controlled
geometries. Meanwhile, at low pH (pH = 2), the overall nanorod shape
remains unchanged as the slow deposition rate allows adequate surface
migration of deposited atoms. We also note that, in the presence of
AgNO3, overgrown nanostructures’ geometries were
further influenced by Ag/Au codeposition, which is prominent at high
pH.

Results and Discussion
Gold nanorods (AuNRs) were prepared
by a modified seed-mediated
growth method using binary surfactant CTAB and sodium oleate in the
presence of silver nitrate and ascorbic acid.35Figure 1 shows the
extinction spectra and the SEM image of the prepared AuNR. The longitudinal
plasmon resonance (LSPR) appears at 666 nm in water (Figure 1a). The nanorods formed were
uniform with the average length and width of 58 ± 7 nm and 25
± 2 nm, respectively (Figure 1c,d). Figure S1 shows the
HRTEM image of a [110]-orientated particle. The image indicates the
orientations of the {111} and {200} planes that are aligned closest
with the particle edges. It is not possible to conclude the crystallographic
nature of the particle facet simply based on a single two-dimensional
projection image; however, our results resemble the result shown by
other groups including Wang and co-workers who identified the presence
of {111}/{110} at corners, {100} at tips, and {110}/{100} at the lateral
facet.24,27,36,37,42 However, possibly due
to the lack of favorably oriented nanorods (standing), we did not
find any additional facet such as the {250} facet reported by the
group of Liz-Marzán.38

length of 25 ± 2 nm and 58 ± 7 nm, respectively.

These AuNRs were then used as seeds for further growth. All
the
reaction conditions and concentrations of CTAB (0.089 M), silver nitrate
(0.354 M), HAuCl4 (0.089 M), and hydroquinone (9 mM) were
kept constant, and the only pH of the reaction was varied from 1 to
8 either by adding 0.2 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH in the reaction medium
as mentioned in the Experimental Details.
The overgrowth of the AuNRs was monitored via vis–NIR spectroscopy.

Extinction spectra of the overgrown nanoparticles at different
pH values are shown in Figure 2a. A clear difference in extinction spectra indicates that
different structures were formed at different pH values. This is also
evident from the SEM images (Figure 2b–e). At pH 2, nanorods retain their overall
shape. However, with an increase in pH, a significant deviation from
the nanorod shape was seen. At pH 4, dog-bone-shaped nanoparticles
were formed, whereas at pH 6, overgrown nanoparticles had an octahedral
shape. At an even higher pH of 8, overgrown nanoparticles had largely
deformed shapes, which resemble the shape of a water chestnut. A summary
of various geometries obtained by varying the pH of the growth solution
and their dimensions is given in Table S1.

To understand the reasons behind
the formation of different nanoparticle
geometries from the same starting nanorod, we monitored the growth
kinetics at different pH values. Figure 3a–d shows extinction spectra of gold
nanorods during overgrowth at pH 8.0, pH 6.0, pH 4.0, and pH 2.0,
respectively. We notice that both the rate and the directionality
of the overgrowth process change significantly with pH of the growth
medium. Overgrowth is slow at low pH but becomes much faster with
the increase of pH of the growth medium. This is evident from the
rate of change of LSPR intensities as a function of time (Figure 3e) for different
pH values. At pH 2, the LSPR intensity increases only by a factor
of 1.2 over a time period of 190 min. In the same time interval, LSPR
intensity increased by 2.7 times when the pH of the growth medium
was 8. A faster overgrowth rate at higher pH is also supported by
inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Figure S3).

Figure 3 (a–d) Extinction spectra of gold
nanoparticles during the
overgrowth process at different pH values of the growth medium (a:
pH 8, b: pH 6, c: pH 4, and d: pH 2) for the initial 190 min in the
growth process. (e, f) LSPR and TSPR intensities as a function of
time at different pH values (magenta: pH 8, red: pH 6, blue: pH 4,
and green: pH 2). (g) LSPR peak position as a function of time during
the overgrowth process. The color code is the same as for (e)–(g).

Monitoring the LSPR wavelengths during the growth
process reveals
that the directionality of the overgrowth process is also different
at different pH values. At pH 2, LSPR wavelengths show a small redshift
of 9.5 nm followed by an even smaller blueshift of 7 nm. This small
LSPR shift indicates that the overall aspect ratio of the nanorods
remains unchanged, and therefore the overgrowth happens uniformly
from all sides of the nanorod. This is consistent with Figure 2e, which shows that overgrown
nanostructures have a nanorod shape. At pH 4, the large redshift of
LSPR by 86 nm was observed indicating that growth is preferred from
the longitudinal direction. It is important to mention that a new
plasmonic mode at 620.5 nm also appears during the overgrowth. The
emergence of a new plasmon mode indicates a deviation from the rod
shape. At even higher pH of 6 and 8, the nanoparticles’ LSPR
shows an initial redshift of 21.5 nm at pH 6 and 26 nm at pH 8 followed
by a large blueshift of 90.5 nm at pH 6 and 31 nm at pH 8. At pH 6,
the overgrown nanostructures’ LSPR overlaps with TSPR and results
in one peak in their extinction spectrum (Figure 3b).

We will now discuss the probable
factors behind the formation of
different nanoparticle geometries from the same nanorod seeds. For
noble metals like Au with an fcc structure, low-index facets are known
to be thermodynamically more stable than high-index facets.31 However, the energies of these facets are different
in the presence of a surfactant or other foreign ions.31,32 In the presence of CTAB, the stability order of the facet reverses
due to the preferential binding of CTAB on (110) greatly reducing
its surface energy.29,32 This coverage is responsible
for variation in diffusion flux of various ions present in the growth
solution toward each surface.31 It has
been reported that, during nanoparticle growth, the Au atoms first
deposit (underpotential deposition) at the (111) facet and then diffuse
to the more thermodynamically stable (100) facet, and the final nanoparticle
geometry is determined by the relative rates of these two processes.31 When the rate of atom deposition (overgrowth)
is slow, as in pH 2, deposited gold atoms are expected to diffuse
to the thermodynamically more stable (100) and (110) facets resulting
in uniform growth of nanorods. This is indeed what we saw at pH 2
(Figure 2e) where the
overall nanorod shape is preserved albeit with a small decrease of
the aspect ratio. With the increasing rate of deposition, it is more
likely that the deposited atoms will not be able to diffuse to thermodynamically
more stable states, and therefore the growth will be predominant along
the (111) plane. This is indeed the scenario at pH 4 where dog-bone
structures were formed (Figure 2d). The formation of dog-bone nanostructures via overgrowth
along {111} facets was also reported previously.24,30,34,39 However, the
growth mechanism seems to be more complex at higher pH values of 6
and 8. Initial redshifts of nanorod plasmon (Figure 3a,b) indicate a preferential growth along
the nanorods’ tips at the early stage of growth. However, that
directionality was lost in the later stage of growth as evident from
the large blueshift of the nanorod plasmon. We believe that such a
growth mechanism is a result of Ag/Au codeposition along with previously
discussed underpotential deposition of Ag. Such codeposition of Ag/Au
was found to be responsible for the formation of different nanostructures,
particularly at high Ag/Au concentrations.25,26 In our study, concentrations of Ag and Au remain unchanged; however,
the effective reduction potential of the reducing agent changes with
the pH of the medium.36 The reduction potential
of hydroquinone is higher at the acidic condition and decreases with
the increase in pH of the medium (Figure S4). In a basic medium, hydroquinone can directly reduce Au(III) to
Au(0) unlike in an acidic condition where hydroquinone first reduces
Au(III) to Au(I), and further reduction of Au(I) to Au(0) can happen
only on the gold seed surface.37,40,41 In fact, at pH 8, we clearly see the formation of gold nanoparticles
in the absence of gold nanorod seeds (Figure S5). Contrary to the underpotential deposition pathway, Au/Ag codeposition
happens preferentially along the lateral side facets leading to an
overall decrease of the aspect ratio (Table S1). This is also consistent with the blueshift of the longitudinal
plasmon resonance (Figure 2a) for the overgrown nanostructures at pH 6 and 8. We believe
that the water chestnut-shaped structure formation is due to fast
Au/Ag codeposition resulting in a rather irregular growth with the
presence of void spaces. The codeposition of Ag is supported by a
large atomic percentage of silver on overgrown nanostructures at high
pH calculated through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Figure 2f) and ICP-OES (Figure S6).

To understand the effect of
the rate of atom depositions on the
final shape of overgrown nanostructures, we monitored overgrowth at
three different Au(III) concentrations in growth solution while keeping
the ratio between Ag(I) and Au(III) unchanged. The pH of the growth
solution was kept at 8. Figure 4 summarizes the result of this study. To get a clear distinction
in the spectra obtained on varying pH, we have shown normalized spectra
in Figure 4a. At pH
8, with the decrease of Au(III) concentrations from 90 to 10 mM, the
rate of the reaction decreases, which is evident from the change of
LSPR intensity versus time plot (Figure 4b), and overgrowth leads to the formation
of different nanostructures (Figure 4c–e). At 90 mM HAuCl4, overgrown
nanostructures have a water-chestnut geometry (same as in Figure 2b). A threefold decrease
in Au(III) concentration in growth solution leads to the formation
of dog-bone-shaped nanoparticles (Figure 4d), whereas a ninefold decrease leads to
rodlike nanostructures (Figure 4e). Interestingly, similar structures were obtained while
the pH of the growth solution was varied (Figure 2b,d,e). This indicates that the rate of deposition
of the Au/Ag atoms dictates the shape of overgrown nanostructures.

Figure 4 (a) Extinction
spectra of starting gold nanorods (black) and overgrown
gold nanostructures at different concentrations of HAuCl4 (red: 90 mM, magenta: 32 mM, and green: 10 mM). The corresponding
AgNO3 concentration was kept at 357.46 mM (red), 128.24
mM (magenta), and 39.52 mM (green) to keep the ratio of Ag/Au at four.
The pH of the solution was kept at 8. (c–e) SEM image of the
overgrown nanostructures at 90, 32, and 10 mM HAuCl4, respectively.

Further, we probe the role of AgNO3 in
determining the
final shape of overgrown nanostructures. We repeated the overgrowth
process at different pH values but in the absence of AgNO3, and the results are shown in Figure 5. The extinction spectra of the overgrown nanostructures
are significantly different at different pH values, indicating the
formation of different nanostructures (Figure 5a). The formation of different nanostructures
was confirmed from SEM images (Figure 5b–e). At pH 2, icosahedron-shaped nanostructures
are formed (Figure 5e). At pH 4, overgrown nanostructures retain overall nanorod shapes,
but the tips seem to have become irregular (Figure 5d). At higher pH of 6 and 8, dog-bone-shaped
nanostructures were formed (Figure 5c and b). A summary of various geometries obtained
in the absence of silver nitrate by varying the pH of the growth solution
and their dimensions is given in Table S2.

and overgrown nanostructures at different pH values of the growth
medium in the absence of silver nitrate (magenta: pH 8, red: pH 6,

nanostructures at pH 8, pH 6, pH 4, and pH 2, respectively.

intensities as a function of time at different pH (magenta: pH 8,
red: pH 6, blue: pH 4, and green: pH 2). (g) LSPR peak position as
a function of time during the overgrowth process. The color code is
the same for (e)–(g).

The formation of different nanostructures in the absence of AgNO3 can be explained in a similar fashion as in the presence
of AgNO3 by considering the rate of Au atom deposition
and their diffusion to thermodynamically more favorable facets. When
the deposition rate is less (at pH 2), the deposited Au atoms readily
move to thermodynamically more favorable (100) facets thereby favoring
growth from those facets leading to the formation of icosahedron structures.
Predominant growth along (100) is supported by the fact that, at pH
2, the LSPR wavelength shows a gradual blueshift and eventually overlaps
with the TSPR mode (Figure 6d). Note that, at same pH values, overgrown nanoparticles
in the presence of 357.5 mM AgNO3 had rod shapes (Figure 2e). This shape difference
can be attributed to Ag(I) ions’ affinity to selectively bind
to (100) facets of the gold nanorod and thereby restricting growth
from these facets.24,32 To verify this, we have studied
overgrowth at the same pH but with increasing AgNO3 concentrations
from 0 mM to 0.4 M (Figure S7). With increase
in the Ag(I) concentration at pH 2, the shape of overgrown nanostructures
changed from an icosahedron (in the absence of AgNO3) to
a nanorod shape. This change of shape supports our assessment that
Ag(I) ions are restricting growth along the (100) plane.

When
the rate of Au deposition is very fast (as in the case of
pH 8 and 6) compared to atom migration, growth happens along (111)
facets resulting in a dog-bone geometry (Figure 5b,c). This growth process is also consistent
with a large redshift of nanorod LSPR during growth (Figure 6g). However, at the same pH
(6 and 8), octahedral and water chestnut-shaped nanostructures were
formed in the presence of AgNO3 (Figure 2b,c), highlighting that codeposition of Au
and Ag is crucial for the formation of those geometries. To further
ascertain the Ag(I) ion’s role, we studied overgrowth at pH
4, 6, and 8 at different AgNO3 concentrations from 0 to
0.4 M. Increasing AgNO3 concentration from 0 to 0.4 M resulted
in a change in the overgrown nanostructures’ shape from nanorod
to dog bone at pH 4 (Figure S8), dog bone
to octahedral at pH 6 (Figure S9), and
dog bone to water chestnut at pH 8 (Figure S10). The different shapes and dimensions obtained by varying silver
nitrate concentrations at pH 2, pH 4, pH 6, and pH 8 are summarized
in Tables S3, S4, S5, and S6, respectively.
These findings establish that the formation of octahedral and water
chestnut shapes are due to silver codeposition.

We note that
Cl– ions did not play any significant
role in the overgrowth process. This was verified by replacing HCl
with HBr to adjust the growth solution’s pH to 2 and 4. Extinction
spectra and the SEM images of overgrown nanostructures in the HBr
medium are shown in Figure S11. The overgrown
nanostructures’ shapes were found to be similar to HCl: dog-bone
shape at pH 4 and nanorod shape at pH 2.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we demonstrated that different complex nanostructures
geometries such as the water chestnut, dog bone, nanobar, and octahedron
can be made via overgrowth of gold nanorods by controlling the pH
of the growth medium and concentration of Ag while keeping all other
reactant concentrations unchanged. In the absence of AgNO3, overgrown nanostructures’ shapes were defined by the growth
rate, which is faster at higher pH. In the presence of AgNO3, overgrown nanostructures’ geometries were influenced by
different growth rates at different pH values as well as Ag/Au codeposition,
particularly at high pH. Our study provides a simple approach to prepare
many complex nanostructures, which are not easily accessible via a
direct seed-growth synthesis approach.

Experimental Details

l-Ascorbic acid (>99%
crystalline), gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4), sodium
borohydride (NaBH4), and silver nitrate (AgNO3) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB, 98%) and sodium oleate (>97%) were purchased from TCI, U.S.A..
Hydroquinone (HQ, 99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar, sodium hydroxide
pellets were purchased from SDFCL, and hydrochloric acid(35–37%)
was purchased from Rankem. All chemicals were used as received. Ultrapure
water (18.2 MΩ cm–1) was used during all syntheses.

Synthesis of Gold Nanorods
(a) Preparation of seeds:
5 mL of 0.5 mM HAuCl4 was added to 5 mL of 0.2 M CTAB and
the solution was stirred for 2 min. Six hundred microliters of 0.01
M NaBH4 was diluted to 1 mL and was then quickly added
to the solution under vigorous stirring. The color of the solution
changed to brown instantly. The seed solution was then kept undisturbed
for 30 min. (b) Preparation of growth solution: a CTAB (1.4 g) and
sodium oleate (0.2468 g) mixture was dissolved in 50 mL of warm Milli-Q
water. The growth solution was prepared by adding 550 μL of
40 mM AgNO3 to 50 mL of the CTAB and sodium oleate mixture.
The solution was stirred for a minute and then kept undisturbed for
15 min. Five hundred microliters of 100 mM HAuCl4 was added
to the solution and the solution was stirred till the solution turns
colorless. One hundred microliters of HCl (11.3 M) was added to the
solution. The solution was stirred for 15 min. Two hundred fifty microliters
of 64 mM ascorbic acid was then added to the solution followed by
the addition of 80 μL of the seed solution. The mixture was
stirred for a few minutes and then kept overnight undisturbed at 28
°C.

Overgrowth of Gold Nanorods
The growth solution was
prepared by adding 50 μL of 40 mM AgNO3 in 5 mL of
0.1 M CTAB, and the solution was kept undisturbed for 15 min. Five
microliters of 100 mM HAuCl4 was added to the above solution
and sonicated until the solution became clear. Different volumes of
0.2 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH were added to vary the pH of the growth solution
from 2 to 8. Five hundred microliters of 0.1 M hydroquinone was added
to the growth solution, which changes the solution to colorless. The
prepared growth solution (1980 μL) was mixed with 20 μL
of the prepared AuNRs and was kept undisturbed.

Characterization
All extinction spectra were acquired
with an Analytik Jena Specord 210 Plus UV–visible spectrophotometer
using a 1 cm quartz cuvette. All spectra were collected at room temperature
(25–28 ° C). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs
were acquired using SEM (JSM 7600FJEOL) at 10 kV. For each sample,
a minimum of 100 particles was measured to obtain the average size
and the size distribution. Transmission electron micrographs were
acquired using 300 kV FEI, Tecnai G2, F30 where the sample was drop-casted
on a 300-mesh copper grid. ICP-OES data were acquired using Avio 200-ICP-OES
