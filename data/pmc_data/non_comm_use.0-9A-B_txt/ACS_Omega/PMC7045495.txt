Controlled synthesis of anisotropic
bimetallic nanostructures with
tunable morphology is of great current interest for their applications
in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), plasmonics, and catalysis.
Despite huge effort that has been devoted so far, fabrication of bimetallic
nanostructures with controlled morphology and size remained to be
a great challenge, especially when their shapes are anisotropic. Here,
we report a facile, one-step synthetic approach for the fabrication
of anisotropic bimetallic gold–copper nanostructures (Au–Cu
NSs) of the 200–300 nm size range, using choline chloride/urea
(ChCl/urea)-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as the soft template.
A concentration of the CuCl2 precursor in the reaction
mixture was found to impact the reduction kinetics of the metal ions,
directly affecting the final morphology of the Au–Cu nanostructures
and elemental distributions in them. The fabricated anisotropic Au–Cu
NSs revealed a high SERS signal for crystal violet (CV) molecules
adsorbed at their surfaces, with the signal enhancement factor as
high as 0.21 × 106 and capacity of detecting CV molecules
of concentrations as low as 10–10 M in their aqueous
solutions. The growth mechanism of the anisotropic bimetallic nanostructures
in DES and their SERS performance has been discussed. The simple DES-assisted
synthesis strategy presented in this work can be adopted for large-scale
nonaqueous fabrication of other bimetallic nanostructures in a quite
“greener” way.

1 Introduction
Bimetallic
plasmonic nanostructures have attracted significant
research interest in recent years because of exceptional optical properties
derived from their size, shape, and composition.1 Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) generated from
the collective oscillation of quasi-free electrons of the metallic
nanostructures under external electromagnetic excitation2 has been exploited to utilize them in different
technological applications such as nonlinear optical devices,2 theranautics,3 photovoltaic
devices,4 biosensing,5,6 photocatalysis,7 and medical diagnosis.8,9 On
the other hand, exploiting the phenomenon that plasmonic nanostructures
confine incident electromagnetic field near their surfaces (near-field
enhancement),3 they have been utilized
as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based molecular
sensing.14,15 As both the far-field (LSPR) and near-field
behaviors of plasmonic nanostructures depend strongly on their geometrical
features (e.g., size, shape, and surface texture) and interparticle
distance in their assemblies,10−12 fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures
with precise control over their morphology is one of the vital issues
that should be resolved before their technology-specific applications.

Nanostructures of noble metals such as silver,13,14 gold,15 and copper16 have drawn much attention in recent times because of their
intense LSPR, tunable from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) region,
and near-field enhancements. In particular, there is a growing interest
in developing different bimetallic nanostructures with a controlled
size and shape, such as core–shell structures with thin (few
atoms) plasmonic shells,17 porous nanostructures
with built-in “hot spots”,18,19 dendritic structures,20,21 and three-dimensional
(3D) hierarchical nanostructured substrates22,23 with controlled interparticle spacing24 in order to create abundant “hot spots” to accomplish
stable and enhanced SERS performance. Among the plasmonic nanostructures
utilized for SERS applications, 3D-branched nanostructures have drawn
special attention because of their anisotropic shapes, which can provide
a large accessible surface area with abundant exposed active sites,
capable of producing far-field and near-field optical responses quite
different from that of common spherical plasmonic nanoparticles.22,25 The added advantage of using such 3D nanostructures in molecular
sensing is that the probe molecules or analytes can diffuse effectively
inside their nanocavities, which significantly increases the adhesion
of analyte molecules at their surfaces, enhancing the overall SERS
signal.26

Over the last decade, anisotropic
Au NPs have been extensively
investigated as effective SERS substrates because of their geometry-dependent
tunable optical properties, easy surface engineering, and structural
stability.27−29 Recently, Au–Cu bimetallic nanostructures
have demonstrated to exhibit interesting optical properties because
of strong intermediate bonding of Cu, good miscibility over a wide
composition range, and composition-dependent tunable LSPR properties.30−32 Furthermore, the large lattice mismatch between Au and Cu induces
anisotropic growth, favoring the formation of highly branched nanostructures
with significant strain in their surfaces, which also affects their
performance in SERS-based spectroscopic applications.33−35 Numerous synthetic approaches have been exploited for the fabrication
of Au–Cu bimetallic nanostructures with controlled size, composition,
and geometry.36−39 However, there exist only a very few eco-friendly or green synthesis
pathways capable of producing metallic nanostructures of controlled
morphology. In this context, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged
as cost-effective, nonaqueous green mediums for controlled synthesis
of metallic and semiconducting nanostructures.40 DES are nontoxic, biodegradable, and environmental friendly
ionic liquid analogues, usually formed by complexion of quaternary
ammonium salt and hydrogen bond donors such as amides, carboxylic
acids, and polyols, use of which was first reported by Abbott et al.
in 2003.41 In addition, extended hydrogen-bonded
structures of DES serve as the soft template for controlled anisotropic
growth of a great variety of nanostructures.42,43 Since the utilization of DES for synthesizing anisotropic Au nanostructures
reported by Liao et al.44 in 2008, this
approach has been extended for fabricating metallic,45 metal oxides,46−48 and dielectric,49 nanostructures. However, DES-assisted fabrication of uniform
bimetallic Au–Cu nanostructures of tailored geometries remained
a challenge.

Herein, we demonstrate a novel, ecofriendly synthetic
strategy
for the fabrication of uniform Au–Cu bimetallic nanostructures
of different geometries using ChCl/urea-based DES, for their utilization
as efficient SERS substrates. Au–Cu nanostructures of different
morphologies were obtained by varying the molar ratio of Au and Cu
precursors under similar reaction conditions. SERS activity of the
fabricated nanostructures was examined by adsorbing crystal violet
(CV) as a probe molecule and exciting by a 633 nm laser beam. The
branched flower-shaped Au–Cu nanostructures exhibit enhanced
SERS activity for the detection of CV molecules, with a detection
limit as low as 10–10 M. SERS activities of the
flower-shaped Au–Cu nanostructures has been compared with Au–Cu
nanostructures of other morphologies fabricated by the same DES-assisted
synthesis.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Structural Characterization
of Au–Cu Nanostructures
The branched Au–Cu
nanostructures were synthesized by reducing Au3+ and Cu2+ ions using l-ascorbic acid (AA) as the reducing
agent and DES as shape-directing, nonaqueous “soft template”
for their controlled anisotropic growth (Scheme 1). The flower-like nanostructures were formed
only for the concentrations of the Cu2+ precursor in the
reaction mixture Au3+–Cu2+ > 1:0.3.
It
is well known that both Au and Cu metals possess a face-centered cubic
(fcc) crystalline structure, with about 11.4% lattice mismatch (lattice
constants of Au and Cu are 0.4079 and 0.3615 nm, respectively).50 While a lattice mismatch higher than 4.6% has
been seen to induce anisotropic nucleation and growth of Au–Cu
nanostructures with highly strained surfaces,51 the extended hydrogen bonds of DES serve as the soft template for
the homogenous anisotropic growth of metallic nanostructures.43,52 To validate this hypothesis, we performed a synthesis without adding
the copper precursor in the reaction mixture, keeping all other conditions
same. The reaction produced uniform gold nanostars (GNSs), as shown
in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
This result, apart from revealing the soft-templating nature of the
DES, indicates the requirement of Cu ions in reaction solution for
the growth of highly branched flower-like nanostructures. Apart from
anisotropic growth, the DES-mediated synthesis of metallic nanostructures
has several other advantages over the common wet-chemical strategies.
For example, the reactions take place in nonaqueous media, which require
no additional surfactant or stabilizing agent. Moreover, using DES
as the solvent and structure-directing agent, it is possible to fabricate
metallic nanostructures of uniform morphologies with high yield.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of Synthesis Steps Used for the Fabrication
of Au–Cu Nanostructures in DES
Typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Au–Cu
nanostructures prepared at 1:0.5 molar ratios of Au and Cu are presented
in Figure 1a–c,
which reveal their uniform, flower-shaped nanostructure of similar
size and shape. Morphological uniformity of the flower-shaped Au–Cu
nanostructures is even clear in their low magnification transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images presented in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Formation of branched
structures of uniform morphology and 200–300 nm sizes in the
sample is very clear in the high-magnification SEM image presented
in Figure 1c. Because
of the highly asymmetric shape of the branched nanostructures, they
have a high surface area and interparticle void spaces or pores. Energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed only the presence of Au and Cu
in the nanostructures (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Furthermore, EDS-elemental mapping was performed on the nanostructures
(Figure 1d), which
indicates that Au and Cu atoms are uniformly distributed over the
entire nanostructure. Notably, the overlapping image of Au and Cu
elements also revealed that the bimetallic nanostructures mainly consist
of Au and Cu atoms, apparently with slightly higher amount of Cu atoms
at their surfaces. The EDS elemental line profiles recorded across
the nanostructures (Figure 2) also revealed uniform distribution of Au and Cu in them.
Intensities of the emission signal corresponding to the two elements
(Au and Cu) are also in accordance with their nominal concentrations
in the reaction mixture. The results demonstrate that the formed nanostructures
are Au–Cu bimetallic alloys.

Figure 1 (a,b) Low and (c) high magnification SEM
images, and (d) EDS-elemental
mapping analysis of the flower-like bimetallic nanostructures fabricated
with Au–Cu = 1:0.5 showing Au (red) and Cu (green) distribution,
respectively.

Figure 2 Typical SEM images and corresponding EDS line
profiles of the Au–Cu
nanostructures fabricated with Au–Cu = 1:0.5. As can be seen
in (a,b) for a single nanostructure, and in (c,d) for two Au–Cu
nanostructures, both Au and Cu are distributed homogeneously in the
nanostructures.

To understand the mechanism of
formation of Au–Cu bimetallic
nanostructures in the DES, we monitored their growth kinetics by recording
the UV–vis absorption spectra of the aliquots extracted from
the reaction mixture at different time intervals (Figure S4, Supporting Information). As can be noticed in
Figure S4 (Supporting Information), at t = 1 min, the absorption spectrum revealed a broad band
extending from 520 to 900 nm, with a detectable hump around 550 nm.
While the absorption spectrum extended over wide spectral range beyond
the usual SPR band position of Au nanoparticles (around 520 nm) is
the indication of bigger and highly dispersing nature of the formed
nanostructures, the small hump detectable around 550 nm indicates
they are rich in Au. In the spectrum recorded at t = 2 min, the absorption band remained broad, with a relative enhancement
of intensity around 680 nm. While the intensity enhancement in the
near-IR spectral range indicates the growth of the asymmetric nanostructures,
evolution of the detectable absorption band around 680 nm indicates
the incorporation of Cu in them. In fact, the SPR appearing around
650 nm for bimetallic Au–Cu nanostructures has also been detected
by Hsia et al.53 As the reaction proceeded
further to t = 5, 10, and 15 min, the position of
the 680 nm LSPR band remained around the same position, while its
intensity decreased with time. The observed decrease in intensity
for longer reaction time is due to increased incorporation of Cu in
the nanostructures, causing the damping of the SPR peak of Au. The
time evolution of the absorption spectra clearly indicates the formation
of Au-rich nucleus or seed at the initial stage and subsequent simultaneous
reduction of Cu2+ and Au3+ ions at the latter
stage of the reaction, resulting the formation of bimetallic Au–Cu
nanostructures.

The choline chloride and urea-derived DES contains
a large amount
of chlorine ions (Cl–). It is well known that the
presence of halide ions (such as Br–, Cl–, I– ions) in the reaction mixture significantly
alters the reduction kinetics of metal ions, influencing the final
morphology and elemental distribution of metallic nanostructures.54 In the present synthesis, Cl– ions play a key role in modulating the reduction rate of HAuCl4 and CuCl2 precursors. While the presence of Cl– ions in high concentration enhances the reduction
rate of both Au3+ and Cu2+ ions, the ratio of
their reduction rate (i.e., the reduction rate of Au3+:
reduction rate of Cu2+) becomes higher. As a result, initially,
the Au3+ ions reduce at a little faster rate than Cu2+ ions, which is followed by the coreduction of Au3+ and Cu2+ in comparable reduction rate, leading to the
formation of Au–Cu alloy nanostructures. In order to elucidate
the role of DES as the soft template for the formation of flower-like
particles, a control synthesis was performed by reducing the Au and
Cu precursors in DI water (as solvent) without the assistance of DES
under the same reaction conditions as used for DES-assisted synthesis
described earlier. As can be observed in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), the resultant product consists highly
agglomerated size-dispersed Au–Cu nanoparticles of varied morphologies,
confirming the shape-directing role of DES. Furthermore, to understand
the effect of the ChCl/urea ratio in the DES, we performed the same
synthesis process in a DES prepared with ChCl and urea in 1:1 molar
ratio. As can be observed in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), instead of flower-like morphology, the resulting
nanostructures are anisotropic with concave surfaces. The difference
in morphology between the nanostructures fabricated in DES with 1:2
and 1:1 molar ratios of ChCl and urea can be associated to the difference
of Cl– ion concentrations in the DES, which directly
influences the surface energy of the initial seed particles affecting
their growth kinetics. In fact, the reduction kinetics such as the
reduction rate of metal precursors is seen to have a drastic influence
on the final morphology of the metallic nanostructures.55 To reveal the effect of reduction rate, we carried
out two supporting experiments replacing AA by other reducing agents
such as NaBH4 (strong reducing agent) and d-glucose
(mild-reducing agent). While the use of NaBH4 as the reducing
agent, as expected, produced agglomerated spherical nanoparticles
(Figure S7, Supporting Information), use
of d-glucose as the reducing agent produced nonuniform flower-like
Au–Cu nanostructures with small Cu NPs adhered at the surface
of Au nuclei (Figure S8, Supporting Information). These results clearly demonstrate the effect of reduction rate
on the final morphology of the Au–Cu NSs.

To probe the
influence of Cu2+ ion concentration in
the reaction mixture on the final morphology of the nanostructures,
we fabricated several samples at various Au and Cu precursor ratios
(1:0.1, 1:0.2, 1:0.3, and 1:0.5). Figure 3 presents low- and high-magnification SEM
images of the Au–Cu nanostructures fabricated with different
Au and Cu precursor ratios. As can be noticed, the variation of Cu
precursor concentration in the reaction mixture produces particles
of different sizes and morphologies. While a low Cu concentration
produced star-shaped Au–Cu nanostructures, higher Cu precursor
concentration (e.g., Au–Cu = 1:0.5) produced flower-like Au–Cu
nanostructures of uniform morphology. EDS elemental analysis of the
Au–Cu NSs prepared at Au–Cu = 1:0.1 molar ratio (Figure
S3, Supporting Information) revealed 87.71
at % of Au and 12.29 at % Cu in the sample, indicating that the ratio
of the two elements in the final structures is close to their nominal
molar ratio in the reaction mixture. Therefore, the nanostructures
fabricated with different ratios of Au and Cu ions in the reaction
mixtures were denoted by corresponding molar ratios.

high-magnification SEM images of the Au–Cu
nanostructures prepared at different Au and Cu molar ratios in the
reaction solution: (a,b) Au–Cu = 1:0.1, (c,d) Au–Cu
= 1:0.2, (e,f) Au–Cu = 1:0.3, and (g,h) Au–Cu = 1:0.5,
respectively.

The LSPR is one of the most important
features of mono- and bi-metallic
plasmonic nanostructures. Both the intensity and position of the LSPR
band of the Au-based bimetallic nanoparticles depend strongly on their
size and composition.50 Hence, the optical
properties of the fabricated Au–Cu NSs were studied by monitoring
the variation of the LSPR peak position in their optical absorption
spectra recorded in the UV–vis spectral range. Figure 4a displays the UV–vis
absorption spectra of the as-grown Au–Cu nanostructures fabricated
with different Cu precursor concentrations in the reaction mixture.
While the pure Au nanostructures (Figure S9, Supporting Information) exhibited two characteristic SPR signals around
528 and broad peak at 645 nm, associated to their anisotropic shapes,52 the NSs prepared with lowest Cu content (i.e.,
Au–Cu = 1:0.1) exhibited no clear LSPR band in its absorption
spectrum with broad and intense absorption over the 500–850
nm spectral range, as has been observed for the nanostructures prepared
with Au–Cu = 1:0.5 (Figure S4, Supporting Information) at the initial stage of reaction. As the concentration
of Cu ions in the reaction mixture increased to Au/Cu = 1:0.3 &
1:0.5, there appeared two detectable LSPR bands around 610 and 741
nm. However, for higher Au/Cu ratio, as expected, the peak of 528
was red-shifted and a detectable LSPR band appeared around 748 nm,
indicating the formation of Au–Cu alloy structures.34,56 The redshift along with broadening of the SPR absorption peak with
increasing Cu content could be due to the incorporation of Cu causing
the introduction of polycrystallinity, change in the dielectric constant
of the material, and the variation in particle morphology.57

Figure 4 (a) UV–vis optical absorption spectra of the colloidal
Au–Cu
nanostructures prepared with different Au and Cu molar ratios; and
(b) XRD patterns of Au–Cu nanostructures prepared at Au/Cu
= 1:0.5, in comparison with pure Au nanostructures.

The structure of the as-synthesized Au–Cu nanostructures
was analyzed further using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique.
As can be seen in Figure 4b, in the 30–80° spectral range, the XRD pattern
of the monometallic Au nanostructures revealed four diffraction peaks
at around 38.18, 44.24, 64.63, and 77.54°, which correspond to
the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of gold in the fcc phase.52 On the other hand, the XRD pattern of the Au–Cu
nanostructures revealed diffraction peaks associated to the (111),
(200), (220), and (311) planes, slightly shifted toward the higher
angle in comparison with their positions in Au NSs (JCPDF no. 04-0784).
The shift can be perceived better in the magnified XRD pattern presented
as the inset of Figure 4b for the spectral region of the Au(111) diffraction band. Considering
the Vegard’s law,58 observed shift
of the diffraction band in the latter sample can be ascribed to the
formation of Au–Cu bimetallic alloy in the nanostructures.58 Minor broadening of the diffraction peaks of
the bimetallic NSs probably occurs because of a reduction of crystallinity
at the nanostructure surface. Bimetallic nature of the fabricated
NSs was further verified by their X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis. The XPS survey spectrum of the sample (prepared at
Au/Cu = 1:0.5) presented in Figure S10a (Supporting Information) confirms the presence of gold and copper elements
in the sample and absence of any other element. The high-resolution
XPS spectrum of the pristine Au NSs in the 4f core-level region (Figure
S10b, Supporting Information) revealed
components located at 83.9 and 87.5 eV. The binding energies (BE)
correspond to the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 orbitals of
metallic Au (Au0).59Figure 5 presents the high-resolution
XPS spectra of Au 4f and Cu 2P emissions of Au–Cu NSs. The
Au 4f core level spectrum presented in Figure 5a revealed two components located at BE of
84.4 and 88.1 eV. As can be noticed, the position of the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 emissions of Au–Cu NSs are
at the higher energy side compared to their positions in pristine
Au NSs, indicating the incorporation of Cu in the bimetallic NSs.
On the other hand, there appeared two component bands for the Cu 2p
emission (Figure 5b)
at the BE positions 932.5 and 952.1 eV, which correspond to the Cu
2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 core-level emissions of metallic
Cu, respectively.59 The absence of strong
satellite peaks around 935 and 955 eV confirmed that copper in the
Au–Cu NSs does not exist in the Cu2+ state.60

2.2 SERS Activity of Au–Cu
Nanostructures
In comparison to the isotropic structures,
highly branched anisotropic
metallic nanostructures exhibit greatly improved SERS performance
because of their typical morphologies and presence of a large number
of edges and cavities, which can provide intense “hot spots”
with large electric-field enhancement.20,22,61,62 To exploit the anisotropic
shape of the Au–Cu nanostructures and their irregular surfaces,
we further examined their utility as SERS substrates for molecular
detection. To investigate the morphology and composition-dependent
SERS activity, we carried out SERS measurements on the Au–Cu
nanostructures fabricated with different Au/Cu ratios. All the SERS
measurements were performed at room temperature, using a 633 nm He–Ne
laser excitation under identical experimental conditions. CV was utilized
as a model analyte for SERS detection. The presence of sharp edges
and pores in the fabricated Au–Cu nanostructures facilitates
the adsorption of analyte molecules to detect them directly from their
aqueous solutions. Therefore, we first recorded the SERS spectra in
aqueous solutions of CV containing the same amounts of metallic nanostructures
dispersed in them (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The SERS spectra of the Au–Cu nanostructures fabricated
with different Au–Cu ratios were dispersed in 10–6 M CV solution. Intense and well-defined dispersion peaks appeared
around 721, 803, 911, 1002, 1171, 1390, 1537, 1586, and 1620 cm–1 correspond to the characteristic vibrational bands
of CV molecules.63 As can be noticed in
Figure S11 (Supporting Information), SERS
signals from the samples containing lower Cu content are weaker in
comparison to the signals recorded for the Au–Cu nanostructures
containing higher Cu contents. Furthermore, we carried out substrate-based
SERS measurements by depositing a fixed amount of nanostructures over
silicon (Si) substrates. For that, first 50 μL (1.0 mg/mL) of
colloidal Au–Cu nanostructures was dropcasted over a clean
Si substrate and dried at ambient temperature. Following the same
technique, SERS substrates were prepared using the nanostructures
of different Au–Cu ratios. The procedure adopted for preparing
the substrates with different nanostructures has been presented in
the Experimental Section. Figure 6a displays the SERS spectra
of CV molecules recorded over SERS substrates fabricated using Au–Cu
nanostructures of different Au–Cu ratios.

Figure 6 (a) SERS spectra of the
CV solution (10 μL, 10–6 M) adsorbed over
Au–Cu nanostructures of different compositions.
(b) Histogram showing the SERS EFs for the Au–Cu nanostructures
of different Cu contents.

To quantify the SERS performance of the fabricated nanostructures,
SERS enhancement factors (EFs) for Raman detection of CV molecules
were estimated using the relation (eq 1) 1  where ISERS and INor are
the signal intensities of SERS and normal
Raman spectra of CV for the same dispersion band (1620 cm–1 Raman band in the present case), and NSERS and NNor represent the corresponding
number of molecules in the focused incident laser spot. Assuming an
uniform distribution of CV molecules over the substrates (nanostructures),
the values of NSERS and NNor in eq 1 can be substituted by the concentration of CV, that is, 1.0 ×
10–6 and 1.0 × 10–3 M, respectively,
as the normal Raman spectra were recorded on CV solution of 1.0 ×
10–3 M concentration (Figure S12, Supporting Information).

Figure 6b shows
that the EF value for the nanostructures depends also on the Cu content
in them. As can be noticed, all the samples revealed high CV signal,
with highest EF ∼ 0.21 × 106 for the substrate
fabricated with flower-shaped Au–Cu nanostructures. The estimated
EFs for the flower-shaped Au–Cu nanostructures were compared
with some of the earlier reported values for the branched mono- and
bimetallic nanostructures and presented Table S1 (Supporting Information). As can be seen, the flower-like Au–Cu
nanostructure fabricated in this work exhibit higher or comparable
SERS performance with respect to the SERS performance of asymmetric
metallic nanostructures reported earlier. As the LSPR signal of Cu
nanostructures is less intense in comparison to the same of Au nanostructures,
apart from the difference in their positions (appear at higher wavelength
for Cu nanostructures), the observed higher SERS signal enhancement
by the flower-like Au–Cu nanostructures can be associated mainly
to their special morphology, which provides intense SERS-active “hot
spots” in their surface.

To evaluate the sensitivity
of CV detection of the SERS substrates
fabricated with flower-shaped Au–Cu nanostructures, which revealed
highest EF, we recorded the SERS spectra of CV molecules over the
particular substrate using CV solutions of different concentrations. Figure 7a depicts the SERS
spectra of CV adsorbed over Au–Cu nanoflowers for CV concentrations
from 10–6 to 10–10 M. As can be
noticed in Figure 7b, the intensity of the 1620 cm–1 Raman signal
increases almost linearly with the increase of CV concentration in
the probe solution. Moreover, the Raman signal of the probe molecules
is quite detectable for the CV concentration as low as 10–10 M. The sensitivity of the flower-shaped Au–Cu nanostructures
exceeds or comparable with the previous studies of mono-/bimetallic
branched nanostructures, which includes FeOOH-doped dendritic Ag nanostructures
(10–10 M),64 graphene/bilayers,
silver/Cu hybrids (10–9 M),65 porous Au–Ag alloy nanosphere arrays (10–10 M),66 and hierarchical Au–CuO
nanostructures (1.0 × 10–8 M).67 As has been stated earlier, the enhanced SERS performance
of the flower-shaped Au–Cu nanostructures can be mainly attributed
to the presence of intense “hot spots” in large numbers
over their porous branched surfaces. It must be noted that although
the 633 nm excitation (He–Ne laser emission) utilized in the
present study lie between the LSPR band positions of pure Au and Cu
NSs, the excitation (laser radiation) could be effectively coupled
with the LSPR emission of the bimetallic NSs, resulting in an enhancement
of the SERS signal. Signal EFs estimated for the fabricated flower-like
Au–Cu NSs are superior to the corresponding values reported
for unbranched metallic nanostructures (see Table S1, Supporting Information).

Figure 7 (a) SERS spectra recorded
over the substrate fabricated with flower-like
Au–Cu NSs for different (10–6 to 10–10 M) CV concentrations; (b) variation of 1620 cm–1 Raman band intensity as a function of CV concentration; (c) comparison
of SERS spectra recorded at 12 different positions of the plasmonic
substrate (fabricated with flower-like Au–Cu NSs) for CV solution
of 10–6 M concentration; and (d) intensity variation
of the 1620 cm–1 dispersion band recorded at 12
different random sites of a substrate fabricated with flower-like
Au–Cu NSs.

As stability and reproducibility
are the major concerns for practical
applications of metal nanostructure-based SERS substrates, we also
performed reproducibility tests on the SERS substrates fabricated
with flower-like Au–Cu nanostructures (Au–Cu = 1:0.5).
To demonstrate the reproducibility of the SERS substrate, we recorded
SERS spectra at 12 random spots over the same substrate using a CV
solution of 10–6 M concentration (Figure 7c). As can be noticed in Figure 7d, the intensity
of the 1620 cm–1 Raman signal of CV recorded over
12 different spots varies between 40 and 60 K. The estimated relative
standard deviation (RSD) of the measured signal intensity was about
13.8%. RSD values less than that of 20% are considered to be acceptable
for the SERS substrates for their practical applications.68 Reproducibility and reliability of the fabricated
SERS substrates were evaluated further by preparing six different
SERS substrates using the same procedure and analyte solutions of
a fixed concentration (10–6 M). The SERS spectra
of the CV solution recorded over six different SERS substrates are
shown in Figure S13 (Supporting Information). Estimated RSD of the SERS signal (1620 cm–1 band)
recorded over six substrates was about 12.5 ± 0.7%, which indicates
a good reproducibility of the fabricated substrates. The stability
of the fabricated SERS substrates was probed further by performing
SERS measurements under continuous laser irradiation at the same spot
(Figure S14, Supporting Information). As
can be observed, although the Raman signal (1620 cm–1) intensity of the analyte (CV) molecules decreases gradually with
the repeated irradiation of the probe laser beam, the signal is quite
intense even after seven irradiation cycles at the same spot of the
substrate. The observed decrease of Raman signal might be due to partial
degradation of CV molecules. Overall, the obtained results indicate
excellent performance (high sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability)
of the SERS substrates fabricated using the flower-like Au–Cu
nanostructures fabricated in DES.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a novel one-pot synthesis strategy for
the fabrication of Au–Cu nanostructures of different compositions
and tunable morphology, using a nonaqueous ChCl/urea-derived DES.
Au–Cu nanostructures of different compositions could be obtained
simply by varying the amount of the CuCl2 precursor in
the reaction mixture. Large lattice mismatch between the component
elements and their distinct reduction potential in the Cl– ion-rich DES solvent are two key parameters which define the final
morphology of the bimetallic nanostructures. Apart from morphology,
the position of the LSPR bands of the bimetallic nanostructures can
be effectively tuned from visible to the near infrared region, simply
by changing the amount of Cu in Au–Cu NSs. Because of the special
flower-like morphology and sharp edges, the nanostructures produce
abundant intense “hot spots” under excitation of laser,
which can enhance the Raman signals of analyte molecules (CV) significantly.
Raman signal EF as high as 0.21 × 106 and CV detection
sensitivity as low as 10–10 M were recorded for
the SERS substrates fabricated using these flower-like Au–Cu
nanostructures. The DES-mediated synthesis process utilized to fabricate
anisotropic Au–Cu bimetallic nanostructures in this work can
be adopted for the fabrication of other bimetallic nanostructures
of different morphologies for their SERS-based spectroscopic applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
Choline chloride
(ChCl, (CH3)3N(Cl)CH2CH2OH]Cl), urea (CO(NH2)2), chloroauric acid (HAuCl4·4H2O, 99.9%), and AA (99%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico. All the chemicals were utilized as received.
Deionized (DI) water from a Millipore system was utilized both for
cleaning the used glassware and the nanostructures.

4.2 Preparation of ChCl/Urea-Based DES
Prior to preparation
of DES, the ChCl was heated at 90 °C for
2 h to eliminate its moisture content, if any. The ChCl/urea-based
DES was prepared following the previous report.52 Briefly, ChCl and urea were mixed together in a 1:2 molar
ratio and heated at 80 °C until a transparent colorless liquid
mixture is obtained. The DES fabricated this way was cooled down to
room temperature and kept at this temperature for at least 2 h prior
to its use in nanostructure synthesis.

4.3 Synthesis
of Au–Cu Nanostructures
For the synthesis of Au–Cu
nanostructures, 10 mg of HAuCl4·4H2O and
5 mg of CuCl2 were added
to 20 mL of freshly prepared DES in a glass beaker under magnetic
stirring at 60 °C, until obtaining a homogeneous dispersion.
Separately, another solution was prepared by mixing DES and AA by
adding 50 mg of AA in 10 mL of DES under magnetic stirring at 60 °C.
Then, the second solution (AA containing DES) was quickly added to
the earlier metal precursor containing mixture solution under magnetic
stirring, keeping the temperature of the mixture fixed at 60 °C.
The mixture solution-containing beaker was covered with aluminum foil
to avoid the absorption of moisture from the ambient. The color of
the reaction mixture slowly turned brown from yellow within 5 min.
The reaction was continued for 30 min. After that, an equal volume
(30 mL) of DI water was added to the reaction mixture. The formed
nanostructures were separated from the colloidal solution by centrifugation
at 12,000 rpm and washed with DI water four times to eliminate DES
and unreacted precursors (if any) from their surfaces. Au@Cu nanostructures
of different nominal Au and Cu molar ratios were fabricated using
an identical procedure, only by changing the molar ratio of Au and
Cu precursors (1:0.1, 1:0.2, 1:0.3, and 1:0.5) in the precursor solution.

4.4 Characterization of Au–Cu Nanostructures
A JEOL-JSM7401F field emission scanning electron microscope operating
at 20 kV and a JEOL JEM-1010 transmission electron microscope operating
at 80 kV accelerating voltage were utilized to study the morphology
and structure of the fabricated nanostructures. Distributions of Au
and Cu in the nanostructures were investigated through their EDS mapping
in a Hitachi SU 8020 scanning electron microscope. Powder XRD spectra
of the samples were collected in a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer,
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.0654 Å). XPS analysis
of the nanostructures was performed in an Intercovamex-XPS110 (Intercovamex,
Mexico) spectrometer, using nonmonochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV)
X-ray source. All the recorded XPS spectra were corrected utilizing
the C 1s line at 284.8 eV. Room temperature optical absorption spectra
of the colloidal nanostructures were recorded in the 300–1100
nm spectral range, in an Agilent 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer,
utilizing plastic cuvettes of 1 cm path length. Raman and SERS spectra
of the samples were collected in a Bruker (SENTERRA) Raman spectrometer,
using the 633 nm line of a He–Ne laser as the excitation source.

4.5 SERS Study of the Au–Cu Nanostructures
For the study of solution-based SERS performance of the fabricated
nanostructures, first, a fixed amount of the as-prepared Au–Cu
colloidal sample (1.0 mg/mL in DI water) was incubated with 25 μL
of aqueous CV solution (10–6 M) for 2 h. Then, the
CV-adsorbed nanostructures were separated from the CV solution by
centrifugation and redispersed in DI water. The CV-adsorbed colloidal
nanostructures were then transferred to a glass cuvette for the SERS
measurements. On the other hand, for the SERS study over silicon substrates,
a 50 μL of colloidal Au–Cu sample (1.0 mg/mL in DI water)
was dropcasted over clean silicon wafers (8 mm × 8 mm) and dried
in air. After that, 25 μL of an aqueous CV solution (10–6 M) was dropped over the sample and dried under ambiental
conditions. The CV deposited substrate was then washed with DI water
twice to remove unabsorbed CV molecules from the nanostructures and
dried further under ambiental conditions. For reference, a SERS substrate
was prepared by dropcasting the CV solution (25 μL) over the
silicon substrate without prior deposition of metal nanostructures.
Both the Raman and SERS spectra were collected in a Bruker (SENTERRA)
Raman spectrometer, using a laser (He–Ne) excitation wavelength
of 633 nm of 2.7 mW. The diameter of the exciting laser spot was fixed
to 4.7 μm under a 50× lens, and the signal acquisition
time was fixed to 3 s.
