Proper design and development of
near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent
sensors is very important for applications in vivo. In this work,
we theoretically designed a ratiometric and NIR fluorescent sensor
based on the 10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline (HBQ) backbone
via systematically investigating the substituent effects of electron-donating
groups (−NH2, −CH3, −C(CH3)3) and electron-withdrawing groups (−NO2, −CN, −F, −Cl, −CF3) at the proton donor site on the proton transfer process in HBQ
in both the S0 and the S1 states. According
to the calculated potential energy profiles along the proton transfer
as well as the photophysical properties among all the derivatives,
we successfully screened out that 7NH2-HBQ is a promising
fluorescent sensor exhibiting the near IR emission spectra accompanied
by the large Stokes shift. The potential use of 7NH2-HBQ
for F– detection among anions (F–, Cl–, and Br–) was further studied,
and the results showed that 7NH2-HBQ is very sensitive
and selective toward F– based on the intermolecular
hydrogen bonding interaction between F– and OH bond,
forming a new complex FACS0. The ratiometric
change in the fluorescence intensity could be induced by the H–F
bond transfer from the O atom to the N atom in the S1 state.

1 Introduction
Excited-state
proton transfer (ESPT) processes have been attracting
extensive attention due to their high potential applications in photoelectronic
materials, photostabilizers, and fluorescent probes.1−4 It is well established that the electron density redistribution
for the proton donor and proton acceptor after photoexcitation provides
a driving force for ESPT.5,6 The feasibility of ESPT
is related to the strength of the hydrogen bond, that is, the stronger
the hydrogen bond, the more likely the proton transfer to occur.7−9 Due to the large Stokes shift accompanied by the ESPT process, the
molecules exhibiting intramolecular ESPT are widely used in fluorescence
sensors and imaging agents. Especially, the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent
sensor is particularly significant in vitro and in vivo. Thus, proper
design and development of NIR fluorescent sensors is a great challenge
and very desirable.

10-Hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline
(HBQ) is a typical
molecule exhibiting excited-state intramolecular proton transfer.10−13 It gains particular attention for its potential applications as
a probe in biological systems and organic light-emitting devices.14−16 So far, many efforts have been made on improving the photophysical
properties and achieved several results. It has been well established
both experimentally and theoretically that, in the ground state, only
the normal isomer (Enol) exists, while after photoexcitation, ESPT
occurs along the intramolecular hydrogen bond O–H···N,
forming Keto, from where orange–red fluorescence is observed.17−20 The electronic properties, photophysical properties, and dynamics
of proton transfer in HBQ could change when chemical modification
is introduced. Recently, Antonov et al.21 studied the substitution effect of an electron-withdrawing group
(−NO2) at site 7 on the proton transfer process
via experiments combined with theoretical calculations and revealed
that the potential energy profiles along the proton transfer could
be changed substantially from a single well to a double well. The
Gryko group22 studied the substitution
effect of electron-rich and electron-poor groups on ESPT behavior
in HBQ and showed that the near IR emission and large Stokes shift
can be obtained through introducing an electron-donating group and
electron-withdrawing group to the pyridine ring. Particularly, they
observed the emission at 745 nm by introducing a CN group and through
π expansion simultaneously, while the effect on photophysical
properties and the proton transfer behavior via substitution to the
phenol ring were rarely examined. Chen et al.23 reported that photophysical properties of HBQ can be tuned from
600 to 655 nm by introducing an electron-withdrawing or -donating
substituent at the phenol ring or through the elongation of the p-conjugation
length. In particular, they pointed out that the electron-donating
(HC=O) group and electron-withdrawing group (OH) could lead to a decrease
and increase of the energy gap for emission. In their work, HC=O,
CN, and OH substituent groups are considered, while other groups are
not examined. So far, as we know, the systematic and comprehensive
study of both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at
the phenol ring on the photophysical properties as well as proton
transfer behavior is not reported.

To reveal whether the HBQ
backbone could be used as an NIR fluorescent
sensor, we further investigated the substituent effects of electron-donating
groups (−NH2, −CH3, −C(CH3)3) and electron-withdrawing groups (−NO2, −CN, −F, −Cl, −CF3) at proton donor site 7 on the photophysics and the dynamics of
proton transfer in HBQ. The corresponding fluorescence properties,
as well as the environmental effect of polar and nonpolar solvents
on the emission and intensity, are also explored in the HBQ-based
chromophore. According to the calculated results, we successfully
screened the 7NH2-HBQ derivative as a potential NIR fluorescent
sensor. Next, we theoretically examined the capability of 7NH2-HBQ for F– detection among anions (F–, Cl–, Br–), and
our results showed that the 7NH2-HBQ sensor is very sensitive24 and selective toward F– based
on the hydrogen bonding of F– and O–H in
the S0 state and F– with N–H in
the S1 state, leading to a ratiometric change in the fluorescence
intensity. This result is very meaningful for rational design of fluorescent
probes based on the HBQ molecule.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Optimized Geometric Structures
in the S0 and S1 States
In this part,
we study
the substitution effect of different functional groups on the geometric
structures of HBQ. The derivatives with electron-donating groups and
-withdrawing groups on proton donor ring site 7 are referred to as
7D-HBQ and 7 W-HBQ, respectively. For a detailed functional group,
D or W is replaced with the functional group in 7D-HBQ or 7 W-HBQ.
For example, the derivative with the NH2 group introduced
is referred to as 7NH2-HBQ. Figure 1 shows all the HBQ derivatives we considered
in this work. The optimized ground-state equilibrium geometries were
obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. In the S0 state,
only Enol can be located in HBQ and all HBQ derivatives except 7NO2-HBQ and 7CN-HBQ. We tried to optimize the Keto structures
for these derivatives, but all attempted structures were optimized
to Enol, which indicates that Keto in HBQ and the HBQ derivatives
(except 7NO2-HBQ and 7CN-HBQ) is not a stationary point
and the reverse proton transfer is very feasible. Figure S1 shows the optimized structures of HBQ and 7D(W)-HBQ
derivatives in the S0 state where Enol and Keto are shortened
as E and K, respectively. The optimized geometry of HBQ in the current
computational level is very similar to the one calculated at the B3LYP/TZVP
level in the previous study,13 which indicates
that our computational method is reliable. All the optimized geometries
for HBQ and the derivatives belong to the Cs symmetry, except 7NO2-HBQ where one of the O atoms in
NO2 is out of the molecular plane. The geometric parameters
of HBQ derivatives do not change much except for the hydrogen bond
distance. The detailed hydrogen bond distances in the Enol (or Keto)
structures for HBQ and HBQ derivatives in the S0 state
are listed in Table 1. The hydrogen bond distance is 1.716 Å in HBQ and ranges from
1.659 in 7NO2-HBQ to 1.725 Å in 7F-HBQ. We note that
the smaller the distance of the hydrogen bond, the stronger the hydrogen
bond, which could facilitate the proton transfer. For Keto, the hydrogen
bond distances are 1.453 and 1.478 Å in 7NO2-HBQ and
7CN-HBQ, respectively. The equilibrium structures of Enol and Keto
in the S1 state were determined by TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d), referred
to as EnolS1 and KetoS1, respectively. Figure S2 shows the optimized
structures of EnolS1 and KetoS1. Only the EnolS1 equilibrium structure
was obtained in 7NH2-HBQ. Table 1 also lists the detailed hydrogen bond distances
in the Keto (or Enol) structures for HBQ and HBQ derivatives in the
excited state. For the optimized EnolS1 structure
in 7NH2-HBQ, the hydrogen bond distance is significantly
decreased compared with that in EnolS0. The
large decrease in the hydrogen bond indicates the enhancement in the
strength of the hydrogen bond, which is expected to facilitate the
proton transfer in the S1 state. We note that the optimized
geometric parameters for KetoS1 in HBQ are very
similar to the one in the previous study,13 which again indicates that the method we used is suitable for this
system. For example, the calculated hydrogen bond distance and OHN
angle in KetoS1 are 1.721 Å and 141.68°
in this study, respectively, and very consistent with previously calculated
values of 1.72 Å and 141.2°.

2.2 Calculated Absorption and Emission Spectra
We calculated the absorption and fluorescence spectra of HBQ and
the derivatives shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The absorption spectra of EnolS0 are dominated by ππ* transitions from HOMO to LUMO within
the aromatic ring in the S1 state. The peak of the absorption
spectra is 363 nm in HBQ in this work, in agreement with experimental
absorption maximum at 370 nm10 and also
consistent with a previous study at 364 nm.20 In HBQ derivatives, the peak of absorption spectra becomes blue
or red shifted depending on the functional groups. In particular,
we noticed that the absorption peak becomes largely red shifted toward
the visible region in 7NH2-HBQ. The calculated emission
peak for the KetoS1 is located at 623.0 nm in
HBQ. The value is very consistent with the experimental value at 609
nm10 and also in agreement with the previous
theoretical study at 621 nm.20 The emission
peaks for EnolS1 and KetoS1 in 7NH2-HBQ were located at 566.6 and 739.5 nm in 7NH2-HBQ. We note that the emission peaks for the KetoS1 are significantly red shifted to the IR region, which
deeply widens the spectra of HBQ. The emission peaks for KetoS1 range from 595.5 to 659 nm in other 7D(W)HBQ
derivatives. Basically, the absorption and emission spectra are significantly
expanded in HBQ derivatives compared with the ones in HBQ. The large
Stokes shift is very meaningful in optical electronic materials and
probes. Thus, we estimated the values of the Stokes shift in HBQ and
HBQ derivatives. The values are very large in HBQ (259.6 nm) and HBQ
derivatives, ranging from 237.5 to 313.0 nm. Combined with the large
potential application of emission spectra in the near IR region, we
point out that 7NH2-HBQ is a very promising material for
this purpose. The solvent effect on the absorption and emission spectra
was also studied for 7NH2-HBQ. The peaks of the absorption
and emission do not change much, calculated to be 565.2 and 727.6
in THF and 561.2 and 728.39 nm in toluene, respectively.

2.3 Molecular Orbital Analysis
The calculated
frontier molecular orbitals of EnolS0 in HBQ
and HBQ derivatives are shown in Figure S3. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) have been shown since these orbitals are
involved in photoexcitation. In HBQ, HOMO and LUMO have a π
(π*) character, with electrons distributed on the proton donor
ring, middle ring, and proton acceptor ring. In HBQ derivatives, due
to the introduction of functional groups, electron distribution on
HOMO and LUMO changes considerably. In 7D(W)HBQ derivatives, electron
distribution on HOMO and LUMO is very similar to that in HBQ except
that the HOMO orbital expands toward the functional group. Particularly,
in 7NH2-HBQ, the HOMO to LUMO transition shows a significant
charge transfer character from the proton donor ring to the proton
acceptor ring. Besides, in all cases, after photoexcitation, the electron
density becomes redistributed, shifted from the proton donor O atom
in HOMO to the proton acceptor N atom in LUMO, providing a driving
force for proton transfer from the Enol structure to Keto structure
in the S1 state.

To further reveal the substitution
effect on the electron density distribution in HBQ and HBQ derivatives,
the Mulliken charge has been examined. We found that the charges for
the atoms are slightly changed except for the atoms connecting with
the functional group. Basically, the charges become less negative
and more negative for the proton donor O and the proton acceptor N
atoms, respectively, when 7NO2, 7CN, and 7CF3 functional groups are introduced, which may facilitate the proton
transfer from the O to N atom. This result is consistent with the
predicted trend for the strength of the hydrogen bond reflected from
the hydrogen bond distance. On the other hand, the charges become
more and less negative on the O and N atoms, respectively, in other
derivatives exhibiting longer hydrogen bond distances.

2.4 Proton Transfer Reaction Path in the S0 and S1 States
We consider the substitution
effect on the dynamics of proton transfer. Figure S4 shows the constrained minimum-energy paths for proton transfer
in HBQ and several HBQ derivatives in the S0 state. In
HBQ, the potential energy increases with the proton transfer from
the O atom to the N atom, which indicates that the proton transfer
is infeasible thermodynamically in the S0 state, and Keto
could not be formed stably. In the derivatives, the potential energy
curves are very similar to that in HBQ but lie slightly higher or
lower than the one in HBQ. The higher the potential energy, the more
difficult for proton transfer to occur. We point out that the potential
energy profile of 7NH2-HBQ lie on the upper part of the
figure and those of 7NO2-HBQ and 7CN-HBQ lie on the lower
part of the figure. This result is very consistent with the strength
of the hydrogen bond in the HBQ derivatives. In Section 2.1, we located the stable
structure Keto in derivatives 7NO2-HBQ and 7CN-HBQ. However,
Keto would tautomerize to Enol through the reverse proton transfer
because this process is both dynamically and thermodynamically feasible.
Thus, Enol could be the only isomer detected in the S0 state
in HBQ and all the derivatives.

Figure 4 shows the potential energy curves along
the proton transfer coordinate in the S1 state in HBQ and
some typical derivatives. The energy of the Enol structure in the
S1 state of HBQ (HBQ derivatives) is taken to be 0.0 kcal/mol
as reference. In HBQ, after photoexcitation, the structure relaxes
toward the proton-transferred structure KetoS1, which lies ∼12.7 kcal/mol lower than the Enol region. The
proton transfer process in HBQ should be very fast because this process
is a barrier-free process. This result is in agreement with a previous
study with a larger basis set8 and also
consistent with the geometry optimization result discussed above.
In 7CH3-HBQ, 7C(CH3)3-HBQ, 7NO2-HBQ, 7F-HBQ, 7Cl-HBQ, and 7CF3-HBQ derivatives,
the potential energy curves are very similar to the one in HBQ, which
suggests a single-well proton transfer process in these derivatives,
with proton transfer in 7CF3-HBQ and 7CN-HBQ being the
fastest followed by 7Cl-HBQ and other derivatives. However, in 7NH2-HBQ, the potential energy curves are slightly different;
both EnolS1 and KetoS1 exist along the proton transfer exhibiting double wells. The energy
barriers for the proton transfer processes are very small, estimated
to be 0.24 kcal/mol in 7NH2-HBQ; thus, fast proton transfer
processes are expected.

Figure 4 Potential energy profiles of ESPT in HBQ and
derivatives in the
S1 state at the (TD)-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in the gas phase.

Solvent effects play important
roles not only in the dynamics for
proton transfer but also in the stability order for isomers. In this
part, we also investigate the solvent effect on the ESPT behavior
in the 7NH2-HBQ derivative, which shows the potential uses
for probes in biological systems. In nonpolar solvent toluene and
polar solvent THF, KetoS1 becomes more stable
than EnolS1 compared with the case in the gas
phase. For example, the energy difference between KetoS1 and EnolS1 in 7NH2-HBQ increases
from 3.8 in the gas phase to 5.39 in toluene and 6.64 kcal/mol in
THF. In 7NH2-HBQ, the proton transfer becomes barrier-free
or almost zero in both nonpolar and polar solvents. Thus, proton transfer
becomes more favorable in solvents than in the gas phase.

Like
HBQ, excited-state intramolecular proton transfer is very
fast in all HBQ derivatives we investigated; thus, HBQ derivatives
could be used for designing probes or organic optical materials based
on the intramolecular proton transfer process. By introducing the
functional group at the proton donor site, we obtained the emission
spectra of the HBQ-based chromophore ranging from 567 to 739 nm in
the gas phase. Through systematical investigation, we obtained promising
candidates that exhibit distinctive emission spectra toward the near
IR region. In 7NH2-HBQ, the peak of emission spectra is
739.5 nm in the gas phase and is not dependent on the solvent polarity,
with peaks located at 727.6 and 728.4 nm in THF and toluene, respectively.
Clearly, the emission spectra have been successfully expanded to the
near IR region. Thus, we expect that 7NH2-HBQ is a potential
candidate as a fluorescent probe in biological systems.

2.5 Sensitivity and Selectivity of 7NH2-HBQ Sensor to
F Anion
In order to examine whether 7NH2-HBQ could
be used as a fluorescent sensor, we theoretically
investigate the fluorescence properties of 7NH2-HBQ for
detecting anions, such as F–. The sensitivity and
the selectivity toward F– among anions (F–, Cl–, and Br–) are discussed
based on the calculated results, and the sensing mechanism24 is further included.

2.5.1 Sensitivity
of 7NH2-HBQ toward
F–
Figure 5 shows the optimized geometries of F-anion-attached
complex 7NH2-HBQ and the deprotonated anionic form in the
S0 state, referred to as FACS0 and
DAS0. Compared with 7NH2-HBQ, the
intramolecular hydrogen bond O–H···N is disturbed
upon addition of the F anion, and the H atom in the hydrogen bond
is directly transferred from the O atom to the F atom, forming a new
intermolecular hydrogen bond O···H–F. In FACS0, bond distances of O···H–F
and N–H···F are calculated to be 1.65 and 2.20
Å; clearly, F–H is bonded with the O atom. Meanwhile,
the NH2 group is rotated with one of the N–H bonds
located in the HBQ plane, and the other N–H bond is almost
vertical to the HBQ plane. The structural parameters are basically
not changed except for the bonds neighboring the new intermolecular
hydrogen bond. We note that no stable tautomerization formed with
F–H bonded to the N atom could be located. All attempted optimizations
from the tautomer structures finally went to the FACS0 structure, which indicates that FACS0 is the only stable form in the S0 state. In DAS0, the structure parameters are basically similar to
FACS0. Figure S5 shows
the optimized geometries for FACS0 and DAS0 at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level. Including the diffuse
function, the structural parameters for FACS0 and DAS0 are rarely changed except the hydrogen
bond distance. The bond distances of O···H–F
and N–H···F are calculated to be 1.54 and 2.40
Å at this level.

Figure 5 Minimum-energy geometries of 7NH2-HBQ upon
addition
of anions in the S0 state optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level in the gas phase: (a) FACS0, (b) DAS0, (c) ClACS0, and (d) BrACS0. Bond lengths are in angstrom.

The corresponding structures in the S1 state, referred
to as FACS1 and DAS1,
are shown in Figure 6. In FACS1, the bond distances for F–H···N
and F–H···O bonds are calculated to be 1.81
and 2.12 Å, respectively. The F–H bond is already transferred
from the O atom to the N atom forming a F–H···N
intermolecular hydrogen bond. Besides, the whole plane for the three
six-membered rings is a little distorted, with C1–C2–C3–N1
calculated to be 7.4°. We note that the structure with F–H
bonded to the O atom is not located, and the optimization directly
went to the FACS1 structure, which means that,
once FACS0 is excited, the F–H bond transfers
from the O atom to the N atom, just like the proton transfer from
O to N in an intramolecular hydrogen bond. In DAS1, the structure parameters are very similar to the ones in
FACS1, except that the plane becomes even more
distorted, with C1–C2–C3–N1 calculated to be
13.7°. The electronic character for FACS1 and DAS1 is very similar to the one in 7NH2-HBQ, showing a considerable charge transfer character from
the phenol ring to the pyridine ring. Evidently, F is rarely involved
in the electronic transition. Figure S6 shows the optimized geometries for FACS1 and
DAS1 at the (TD-)B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level. For
FACS1, the structural parameters are basically
unchanged except the hydrogen bond distance. Besides, the rigid plane
of HBQ becomes distorted with the phenol ring out of the plane of
the other two rings. The optimized structure for DAS1 is very similar to the one without the diffuse function.

geometries of 7NH2-HBQ upon addition
of F– in the S1 state optimized at the
(TD)-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in the gas phase: (a) FACS1 and (b) DAS1. Bond lengths are in angstrom.

The simulated absorption spectra
for FACS0 and DAS0, as
well as the simulated emission
spectra for FACS1 and DAS1, are shown in Figure 7a,b, respectively. The simulated absorption and emission spectra
for HBQ and 7NH2-HBQ are also included for comparison.
For FACS0, the shape of absorption spectra is
very similar to the one for 7NH2-HBQ but is widely expanded
toward 600 nm. The absorption peaks for FACS0 are located at 285, 404, and 506 nm, which correspond to the electron
transition from HOMO-2 to LUMO (mainly local excitation character),
HOMO to LUMO+1 (mainly charge transfer character), and HOMO to LUMO
(mainly charge transfer character), respectively. Including the diffuse
function, the absorption peaks are only slightly red shifted, calculated
to be 292, 416, and 513 nm for FACS0. The shape
for DAS0 is basically similar to the one in
FACS0 toward the long wavenumber. The main absorption
peaks appear at 319, 419, and 540 nm, which correspond to HOMO to
LUMO+2 (mainly charge transfer character), HOMO to LUMO+1 (mainly
charge transfer character combined with local excitation), and HOMO
to LUMO (mainly charge transfer character) transition, respectively.
The main absorption peaks are calculated to be 355, 435, and 554 nm
for DAS0 when the diffuse function is included.
Evidently, upon addition of F– or forming the deprotonated
form, the absorption spectra in FACS0 or DAS0 are not only red shifted but also broadened.
The involved frontier orbitals are shown in Figure S7. Compared with the absorption spectra for FACS0 or DAS0, the emission spectra
for FACS1 and DAS1 are
largely red shifted towards the IR region. The emission energy for
FACS1 (or DAS1) is calculated
to be 1.42 (or 1.28) eV, which is smaller than the one for 7NH2-HBQ without including F–. The values are
slightly changed considering the diffuse effect, calculated to be
1.28 and 1.31 eV at the (TD)-B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level for FACS1 and DAS1, respectively. Except
this, the fluorescent intensity is also changed upon addition of F–. Thus, 7NH2-HBQ is very sensitive toward
F– from both absorption and emission spectra; no
matter, the final product is FACS1 or DAS1. Considering the solvent effect in THF, the fluorescence
intensity becomes slightly increased and the Stokes shift becomes
a little smaller.

and BrACS0 at the (TD)-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level

2.5.2 Selectivity
of Detection of F– among F–, Cl–, and Br– Anions
In this
part, in order to examine whether 7NH2-HBQ is selective
to F–, we investigated
the equilibrium structures and absorption spectra for 7NH2-HBQ with Cl– and Br–. The optimized
structures for Cl–- and Br–-attached
7NH2-HBQ are shown in Figure 7, referred to as ClACS0 and BrACS0, respectively. Structurally, ClACS0 and BrACS0 are very similar
to each other. Unlike FACS0, the intramolecular
hydrogen bond is not disturbed in these complexes, and Cl– (Br–) is located at least 2.5 Å away from
the pyridine ring. The simulated absorption spectra for ClACS0 and BrACS0 are also shown in Figure 7a. In contrast to
the absorption spectra for FACS0, there is no
absorption for both ClACS0 and BrACS0 in the UV region, while very small absorption appears
near 786.8 nm for ClACS0 and 908.7 nm for BrACS0, which corresponds to the charge transfer from
Cl– (Br–) to 7NH2-HBQ.
We tried to optimize the equilibrium structure in the S1 state for the complexes ClACS0 and BrACS0, but all the optimizations lead to the dissociation
for the complex, which might result from the charge transfer from
Cl– (Br–) to 7NH2-HBQ.
Thus, 7NH2-HBQ is very sensitive to F–. All the above results lead us to deduce that 7NH2-HBQ
is selective to F– due to the hydrogen bond.

In summary, upon addition of F–, 7NH2-HBQ could interact with F–, forming a stable complex
FACS0, with F–H bonded with the O atom.
The absorption spectrum for FACS0 is widely
expanded compared with the one for 7NH2-HBQ. Once it is
excited, the F–H bond is transferred from the O atom to the
N atom, forming the FACS1 structure, from where
the fluorescence of 875 nm could be observed. However, 7NH2-HBQ could only interact with Cl– and Br– weakly, forming ClACS0 and BrACS0 without disturbing the intramolecular hydrogen bond,
respectively. The absorption spectra for ClACS0 and BrACS0 are very different from the one
in FACS0, which indicates that 7NH2-HBQ is sensitive and selective to F–.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have theoretically
designed a ratiometric and
NIR fluorescent sensor for F-anion detection based on the HBQ backbone
with DFT and TDDFT methods. First, we systematically investigated
the substitution effect of a series of electron-withdrawing groups
(−NO2, −CN, −F, −Cl, −CF3) and electron-donating groups (−NH2, −CH3, −C(CH3)3) at the site 7 on
the photophysical properties and proton transfer process in HBQ. We
found that not only the proton transfer process but also the photophysical
properties could be modulated via the introduced groups. It is revealed
that proton transfer in the S1 state is very fast and favorable
in HBQ and all HBQ derivatives due to the barrier-free or almost barrier-free
process. Besides, the energy gap of HOMO and LUMO could either be
increased or decreased, leading to the blue or red shift of the absorption
and emission spectra. The emission spectra can be tuned from 567 to
739 nm in the derivatives. In particular, we found that 7NH2-HBQ has very small emission energy, which is a promising candidate
for NIR fluorescent probes in biological systems.

Second, the
7NH2-HBQ sensor is used to detect F– among
anions (F–, Cl–, and Br–) through investigating the absorption
and emission spectra before and after including the anions. We found
that the 7NH2-HBQ sensor is very sensitive and selective
to F–, showing a ratiometric change in the fluorescence
intensity. This phenomenon could be explained that the intramolecular
hydrogen bond N···O–H is disturbed upon addition
of F– due to forming complex FACS0 with a new intermolecular hydrogen bond F–H···O.
After excitation, the F–H bond is transferred from the O atom
to the N atom, accompanied by the large Stokes shift.

4 Computational Details
Equilibrium geometries of Enol with
the H atom bonded to the O
atom and Keto with the H atom bonded to the N atom in the S0 state were determined by the B3LYP25 method,
while geometries of minima in the S1 state were determined
by the TDDFT method with the B3LYP (TD-B3LYP) functional. All minimums
in the S0 and S1 states were confirmed by normal
mode analysis at the B3LYP and TD-B3LYP levels, respectively. The
constrained minimum-energy paths (cMEPs) for the proton transfer were
determined by fixing the hydroxyl group (−OH) bond length in
increments of 0.1 Å in both the S0 and S1 states. In this study, 6-31G(d) was used for the optimization in
DFT and TDDFT calculations. This basis set has been proven to be reliable
for this system. In detail, we have compared the geometries optimized
by using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set with the ones obtained with
using the TZVP basis set in a previous study,13 and we found that the geometries are very similar to each other.
For example, the distance of the hydrogen bond and the angle of O–H–N
are 1.716 Å and 148.2° at the current computational level,
and the corresponding values at the TZVP level are 1.71 Å and
148.1°, respectively. Thus, 6-31G(d) is chosen for the S0 and S1 state calculations. Besides, the consistency
of the calculated absorption (emission) energies with the available
experimental values for the absorption (emission) peak for some HBQ
derivatives again demonstrates that the current computational level
is reliable for HBQ derivatives. In the case of the F-anion sensing
process, 6-31+G(d) was used to examine the diffuse function effect
on the geometry optimization and excitation energy calculations. All
calculations were performed using Gaussian 09,26 and the solvent effect was included using the IEF-PCM27 model.
