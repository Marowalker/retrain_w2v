In this article,
the silk fibroin (SF)/graphene oxide (GO)-blended
nanofibers with one bioinspired nanostructure are fabricated via electrospinning.
The morphology, chemical structure, antibacterial activity, and biocompatibility
of the blending nanofibers are investigated. The results indicate
that GO plays an important role in preparing the distinctive bioinspired
structure. The antibacterial activity and in vivo cell culture test
demonstrate that blending of GO could improve the antibacterial activity
and biocompatibility of SF nanofibers. The blended nanofibers developed

1 Introduction
Recently,
electrospinning has been used widely to fabricate various
biomedical materials because it can prepare nanofibers to mimic the
extracellular matrix.1−4Bombyx mori silk extracted from the
silkworm is called the empress of fibers due to its unique properties
(mechanical and optical characteristics).5,6 Native Bombyx mori silk is composed of silk fibroin (SF)
coated with silk sericin proteins. Because of favorable biocompatibility
and a minimal inflammatory reaction,7 SF
has been fabricated into a variety of silk-based materials, such as
gel, fiber, powder, sponge, film, tube, and so on,8−13 and these silk-based materials have been widely used for tissue
engineering scaffold.14−16

During the past 3 years, there have been many
reports about electrospinning
SF nanofibers, which are used for wound dressing.17,18 As we know, wound dressing materials have higher requirements for
antimicrobial and biocompatible materials. However, the SF is known
for lacking antibacterial property and the biocompatibility of SF
needs further improvement. Therefore, in practical applications, SF
is often modified by some functional nanomaterials.19−21 Graphene oxide
(GO) contains a large number of functional groups and an extremely
large surface-to-volume ratio, which gives some unique properties
of GO, such as excellent hydrophilicity, dispersion, and biocompatibility.
In addition to the above properties, GO has one unique antibacterial
property. Because of the above excellent performance, GO has been
widely used in biomedical materials.22−25

In this article, the SF/GO-blended
nanofibers are fabricated by
electrospinning. Macroscopic and microscopic morphologies of the blended
nanofibers are prepared by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission
electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectra.
In particular, the antibacterial property and biocompatibility are
characterized by antibacterial experiment and cell culture. Furthermore,
the mechanisms of improving the antibacterial mechanism and biocompatibility
are analyzed. The testing results show that the blended nanofiber
is an appropriate candidate for wound dressing.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Morphology and Microstructure
of GO
The morphology of the GO sheets is characterized by
TEM and atomic
force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 1a,b), as shown in the TEM and AFM images; it shows GO’s
typical lateral dimensions and a single-layer structure, with thickness
of 0.8 nm.26 The microstructure of GO was
studied by Raman and XPS; the results are shown in Figure 1c,d. It could be seen from Figure 1c that two characteristic
peaks of 1340 and 1580 cm–1 are shown in the Raman
spectrum, which could be assigned to the D-band and G-band of carbon,
respectively.27 According to the result
of XPS, we calculate the atomic ratio of C/O in the GO nanosheet is
about 2.2. According to the peak fitting of the carbon element (Figure 1d), four types of
carbon bonds are characterized, which are alkyl/olefin (284.6 eV),
aldehyde (286.6 eV), carbonyl (287.7 eV), and carboxyl (289.0 eV),
respectively. Because of these hydrophilic bonds, the GO can disperse
well in water.28,29 The above results indicate that
the GO sheets are prepared successfully.

2.2 Morphology of the Electrospinning SF/GO-Blended
Nanofibers
Figure S1 shows the
morphology of the as-spun and ethanol-treated pure SF and SF/GO-blended
nanofibers with different blended ratios. It could be seen that the
homogeneous and beads-free nanofibers could be obtained using pure
SF solution. However, there are a number of spheres attached to the
surface of the SF/GO-blended nanofibers and the quantity of the spheres
increases with the increase of the GO concentration. To analyze this
phenomenon, we chose the SF/GO-blended nanofibers with high concentration
of GO as the research subject.

Figure 2a,b shows the SEM images of the pure SF and
SF/GO-blended nanofibers (with GO concentration of 5 wt %). As shown
in Figure 2a, homogeneous
and beads-free nanofibers could be obtained using pure SF solution;
the average diameter of the nanofibers is about 100 nm. It could be
seen from Figure 2b
that the SF/GO nanofibers can also be fabricated successfully by electrospinning.
However, the diameter of the SF/GO-blended nanofibers decreases when
compared to that of the pure SF; this is due to the addition of GO
aqueous solution that decreases the viscosity of the spinning solution,
which is shown in Figure S2. Moreover,
it can be seen from Figure 2b that the surface has a number of spheres attached to the
surface of the fiber in a beaded form. From Figure 2b, we cannot find the GO; it is concluded
that the beads on the surface of the blended nanofibers are GO, which
are packaged by SF on the surface. To verify the above hypothesis,
the SF/GO-blended nanofibers are observed by TEM. Figure 2c shows a homogeneous distribution
of the pure SF nanofibers, and it can also be seen from Figure 2d that there are a number of
spheres on the surface of the SF/GO-blended nanofibers. Furthermore,
as shown in the high resolution of the TEM image (Figure 2d), we can clearly see that
the GO nanosheets are packaged inside the SF nanofibers. Therefore,
it is concluded that the GO nanosheets are coated in the SF nanofibers
with a globular form. Moreover, the dimension of the packaged GO nanosheets
ranges from 50 to 1000 nm.

nanofibers (d).

2.3 Chemical
Structures the Electrospinning SF/GO-Blended
Nanofibers
Figure 3 shows the Raman spectra of the pure SF and SF/GO-blended
nanofibers. As shown in Figure 3, both the SF and SF/GO nanofibers do not show obvious SF
characteristic peaks at 1660 and 1250 cm–1 (amide
I and amide III absorption peak, respectively). Only weak peaks could
be seen; this is because the degummed SF has weak fluorescence, which
has an interference effect on the Raman spectroscopy.30,31 Therefore, the characteristic absorption peaks of the amide bonds
of SF are not clearly displayed in Raman spectra. Furthermore, the
Raman spectrum of SF/GO-blended nanofibers has two prominent peaks
at 1340 and 1580 cm–1 when compared with the pure
SF nanofibers, which are assigned to the D-band and G-band of GO,
respectively. The above results show that the GO is successfully blended
into SF nanofibers, which is consistent with the SEM and TEM analysis.

Figure 3 Raman
spectra of the SF and SF/GO-blended nanofibers.

The crystalline structures of the electrospinning pure SF
and SF/GO-blended
nanofibers are identified by XRD, as shown in Figure 4. From Figure 4, it is possible to observe that the GO nanosheets
exhibit a distinct peak at 2θ = 11°. According to the Bragg
equation 2d sin θ = nλ, the interlayer spacing of our synthesized GO can be calculated
as 0.8 nm. Besides, it can be seen that the diffraction angles of
the pure SF nanofibers are almost similar to that of the pure SF nanofibers
and the diffraction peaks corresponding to GO are not observed, which
indicates that SF and GO are evenly blended and the addition of GO
does not affect the crystalline structure of SF. Furthermore, the
diffraction peak at 2θ = 20.6° (4.5 Å) of the SF/GO-blended
nanofibers is sharper than that of the pure SF nanofibers, indicating
the presence of faint crystals. Because of the strong interaction
between regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) and GO, GO sheets may act as
cross-link points among the amorphous RSF chains.32,33

Figure 4 XRD
spectra of the SF and SF/GO-blended nanofibers.

To verify the chemical composition of the electrospinning
SF and
SF/GO-blended nanofibers, XPS analysis is carried out. Figure 5a,c show the XPS spectra of
SF and SF/GO-blended nanofibers, respectively. As shown in Figure 5a,c, it can be seen
that there are not any differences between the pure SF and SF/GO-blended
nanofibers. Figure 5b,d shows the high-resolution carbon XPS of the SF and SF/GO-blended
nanofibers. It could be seen that the carbon element mainly exists
in alkyl (284.6 eV), aldehyde (286.9 eV), and carbonyl groups (288.4
eV) than in pure SF scaffold (Table 1). However, it exists in alkyl (284.6 eV), aldehyde
(286.9 eV), carbonyl (288.4 eV), and carboxyl groups (289.7 eV). Moreover,
the aldehyde group and carboxyl group occupy the main part of the
carbon element in SF/GO-blended nanofibers when compared with the
pure SF nanofibers. The above results show that blending of GO could
induce an increase in the number of oxygen-containing groups. This
is probably because blending of GO leads to some new combinations
between the SF and GO, such as hydrogen bonds, which is shown in Figure S3a, and these new combinations increase
the number of hydrophilic groups and oxygen-containing groups, such
as aldehyde, carbonyl, and carboxyl. The formation of hydrogen bonds
between SF and GO is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared, as shown
in Figure S3b; that is, the characteristic
absorption peaks of amide I and amide II of SF did not shift significantly,
indicating that blending of GO does not affect the main structure
of SF, but the intensity of the hydrophilic group (carboxyl and hydroxyl
group) in the SF/GO-blended nanofibers is stronger than that of the
pure SF nanofibers.

2.4 Antibacterial Activity
of the Electrospinning
SF/GO-Blended Nanofibers
To investigate the antibacterial
activity of the SF/GO-blended nanofibers, Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) are used; the results
are shown in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6a, the survival rate to E. coli and S. aureus of pure SF nanofibers is (83.9 ± 7.0)
and (89.3 ± 4.8)%, respectively, which shows that the SF nanofibers
do not have antibacterial property. However, the survival rate to E. coli and S. aureus of SF/GO-blended nanofibers is (35.7 ± 3.6) and (41.6 ±
0.3)%, respectively, which are remarkably (p <
0.05) lower than those of the pure SF nanofibers, indicating that
the SF/GO-blended nanofibers have an excellent antibacterial property.
To characterize the antibacterial clearly, we chose E. coli to observe its morphology on the surface
of the pure SF and SF/GO nanofibers; the results are shown in Figure 7b,c, respectively.
It could be seen that the growth of E. coli on pure SF nanofiber is good and the size of bacteria is large.
However, E. coli is gradually shrinking
on the SF/GO-blended nanofibers and some bacteria have died (Figure 6c, yellow arrow).
Moreover, the number of bacteria decreased when compared with the
pure SF nanofibers. The antibacterial mechanism of GO is such that
the GO can destroy bacterial membranes, leading to the efflux of intracellular
material and killing bacteria.34,35

2.5 Biocompatibility of the Electrospinning SF/GO-Blended
Nanofibers
The (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) (MTT) assay is employed to compare the cell viability of
the SF/GO-blended nanofibers to that of the pure SF nanofibers (Figure 7). There is a clear
temporal proliferation profile of the cells after 1, 3, and 7 days
of culture on both SF and SF/GO-blended nanofibers. It follows that
cells remained viable on all of the samples. As shown in Figure 7, the cell viability
cultures on the SF/GO-blended nanofibers appear significantly higher
than that of the pure SF nanofibers at 1, 3, and 7 day time points
(p < 0.05). The above result shows that the blending
of GO contributes to the proliferation of the cells. This is probably
because blending of GO increases the number of oxygen-containing groups,
such as aldehyde, carbonyl, and carboxyl, and this is verified by
XPS analysis.

Laser confocal microscopy is carried out to study
the dynamics of cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation on the
nanofibers after fluorescent straining with fluorescein diacetate,
as shown in Figure 8. MC3T3 cells are adhered to and spread on the SF/GO-blended nanofibers
after 1 day in culture; these cells show greater cell adherence and
a higher degree of spreading than that of the pure SF nanofibers.
Compared with the number of cells that adhere to the SF/GO-blended
nanofibers (Figure 8b), fewer cells adhere to the pure SF nanofibers (Figure 8a). After 3 days of cell culture,
profuse cell growth is observed throughout the SF/GO nanofibers compared
with the pure SF nanofibers. After 7 days, MC3T3 cells-seeded SF/GO
nanofibers are fully covered with a thick cell multilayer, as well
as extracellular matrix possibly concealing the surface of SF/GO-blended
nanofibers. These results suggest that cell adhesion, spreading, and
proliferation of MC3T3 cells have indeed been improved by SF/GO-blended
nanofibers. It is consistent with the MTT analysis.

nanofibers: (a), (c), and (e) cells culture on SF after days 1, 3,
and 7, respectively; (b), (d), and (f) cells culture on SF/GO after
days 1, 3, and 7, the scale bar is 100 μm.

Figure 9 shows
a
high-resolution image after 7 days of culture; it can be seen that
cells can grow well both on SF and SF/GO-blended nanofibers. However,
the proliferation and differentiation of the cells on the blended
nanofibers are better and the cells on the blended nanofibers show
a spindle shape. The results further prove that the blending of GO
is in favor of the cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation.

(b) nanofibers after culturing for 7 days, the scale bar is 50 μm.

The SEM images exhibit the morphologies
of inoculated MC3T3 cells
on the pure SF and SF/GO-blended nanofibers, as shown in Figure 10. In comparison
with the pure SF nanofibers, MC3T3 cells on the SF/GO-blended nanofibers
after 1 and 3 days of cell culture show a much higher degree of spreading.
After 7 days, the morphology of MC3T3 cells growing on the SF/GO-blended
nanofibers shows a much thicker and denser attachment, the cells form
cell sheets, concealing the nanoporous structures of SF/GO-blended
nanofibers (Figure 10f,h). The inoculated MC3T3 cells attach and grow much better on the
SF/GO-blended nanofibers compared with pure SF nanofibers. The results
also prove that the blending of GO is in favor of the cell growth,
proliferation, and differentiation.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the SF/GO-blended nanofibers with a nano–micro
multiscale porous structure are successfully fabricated via electrospinning.
SEM and TEM analyses show that GO is successfully blended into SF
nanofibers with a globular form of the surface of the nanofibrous
membrane. XRD result shows that SF and GO are evenly blended and the
addition of GO does not affect the structure of SF and blending of
GO induces faint crystals of SF and increases the number of oxygen-containing
groups. Our results indicate that blending of GO could improve the
antibacterial activity and biocompatibility of SF nanofibers. The
relatively simple methodology and the outstanding performance of the
multiscale porous SF/GO nanofibers suggest that it possesses extensive
potential for application in wound dressing.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of the SF/GO Nanofibers
GO nanosheets were prepared from natural graphite powder by a modified
Hummers method.36−38Figure 11 shows the schematic illustration of preparation of the SF/GO-blended
nanofibers. As shown in Figure 11, the SF aqueous solution was prepared according to
our previous research.9 The dialyzed SF
aqueous solution was air-dried to obtain the regenerated SF membrane.
The air-dried SF regenerated membranes were dissolved in 98% (w/w)
formic acid to obtain the SF/formic acid (amount of SF was 13 wt %)
solution. Then, the spinning solution is prepared by adding the different
GO aqueous solutions (3, 4, and 5 wt %) with concentration of 3 wt
% to the SF/formic acid solution. For electrospinning, the voltage
is 30 kV, the distance between the needle and collector is 13 cm,
and the flow rate of the solution is 0.2 mL/h. As the as-spun SF and
SF/GO nanofibers are water soluble, the treatment process was carried
out by immersing the nanofibers in ethanol for 15 min after electrospinning.
After ethanol treatment, the samples were given a post-treatment to
remove residual ethanol.39

of preparation of the SF/GO-blended nanofiber.

4.2 Characterization
Viscosity of the
spinning solution and morphology of the GO and electrospinning nanofibers
are characterized according to the previous research.40 GO aqueous solution is deposited on to the silicon wafer,
and the AFM image is obtained by the AFM facility (Bruker, Multimode
8).41 Raman spectra of the GO and electrospinning
blended nanofibers were recorded on a Raman microscope (HORIBA Jobin
Yvon, HR800) with a 514 nm wavelength laser. Full spectra of elements
on the surface of GO and electrospinning blended nanofibers were measured
by XPS (model XSAM800, Kratos Co. Ltd., England), and the high-resolution
mapping of carbon element was measured. XRD spectra of the electrospinning
blended nanofibers were carried out on an X-ray diffractometer with
Cu Kα radiation (Philips, X’Pert-Pro MRD).

4.3 Antibacterial Properties of the SF/GO-Blended
Nanofibers
The antibacterial property of the electrospinning
blended nanofibers was tested against Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus. Antibacterial activity of the electrospinning blend nanofibers
are investigated according to our previous research and FZ/T 73023-2006
(China).42,43 To demonstrate the antibacterial effect
more clearly, we chose one kind of bacterial species (E. coli) and observed the morphology of the bacterial
species on the electrospinning blended nanofibers by SEM (S-4800,
Hitachi), according to ref (44).

4.4 Biological Evaluation Based
on in Vitro Cell
Culture
For biological evaluation, we use preosteoblast cells
MC3T3-E1 to characterize the biocompatibility of the electrospinning
blended nanofibers. The method for cell culture is according to refs (15, 45, 46).

4.5 Statistical Analysis
All data were
expressed as means ± standard deviations. The statistical significance
of differences among each group was examined by the t test. The significance was set at p < 0.05 level.
