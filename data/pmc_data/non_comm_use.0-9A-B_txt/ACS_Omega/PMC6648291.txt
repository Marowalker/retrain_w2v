A mild,
one-pot procedure to produce 3-substituted allylic alcohols
from α,β-unsaturated ketones is described. The addition
of an organolithium nucleophile produces a tertiary allylic alcohol
as an intermediate, which undergoes a 1,3-OH-migration assisted by
FeCl2. The proposed mechanism indicates that a syn-facial migration occurs for the major product. Yields
as high as 98% for the one-pot reaction are reported.

Introduction
Allylic alcohols are
indispensable functional groups in the synthesis
of structurally complex organic molecules.1−8 3,3′-Disubstituted allylic alcohols, in particular, are often
more difficult to synthesize than their monosubstituted counterparts.
Though methods such as the conjugate addition of nucleophiles to ynones
and the addition of organometallic reagents to propargylic alcohols
have been described,9−13 one method that has received little attention is the 1,3-migration
of the hydroxy group in tertiary allylic alcohols. This transformation
has been primarily catalyzed by oxo catalysts,14−16 though oxidative
palladium catalysis has also been employed to perform the migration
and oxidize the allylic alcohol to a β-disubstituted enone.17 This rearrangement can be performed by
enzymes to form enones.2 A rhenium-assisted
rearrangement has also been used in the synthesis of semisquarates.18 Trifluoroacetic acid has also been used to isomerize
allylic alcohols, and this method has been applied to the synthesis
of valerenic acid, which binds to both the GABAA and 5-HT5A receptors, and is used as a treatment of insomnia.19 Acid-assisted allylic alcohol rearrangement
was also used in the synthesis of two quinolone natural products isolated
from Pseudonocardia sp.20 Additionally, one can envision that this rearrangement could be
used to create artemisinin-like antimalarial drugs via Singh’s
synthetic scheme (Scheme 1).21

Scheme 1 Application of Allylic
1,3-Migrations
Iron has recently
been studied as a catalyst for a number of coupling
reactions.12−28 The most widely used of these processes are alternatives to traditional
palladium-catalyzed transformations, such as the Kumada coupling and
C–H arylation and alkylation reactions.22,29,30 Even a few examples of substitution reactions
via π-allyl iron intermediates have been reported.31−35 Iron is preferable to late transition metal catalysts due to its
low expense and toxicity. Additionally, iron catalysts are often capable
of performing synthetic steps that conventional late transition metal
catalysts cannot perform, such as breaking and functionalizing strong
C–O bonds. Herein, we describe a one-pot addition of an organolithium
reagent to an α,β-unsaturated ketone, followed by an iron-mediated
1,3-rearrangement reaction. We propose that the novel reaction proceeds
via the formal cleavage of a C–O bond and the intermediacy
of an allylic cation.

Results and Discussion
During the
course of our studies on iron-mediated reactions involving
organolithium and organomagnesium nucleophiles,30,36 we discovered that the addition of an organolithium reagent to an
α,β-unsaturated ketone in the presence of an iron salt
does not result in the expected 1,4-addition products, but rather
an isomeric allylic alcohol is formed (2).

Cyclohex-2-enone,
(1) was chosen as a reliable and
simple substrate for reaction optimization (Table 1). A number of both iron(II) and iron(III)
salts were selected, out of which FeCl2 was determined
as the most efficient reagent. In general, iron(III) salts were inferior
to iron(II) salts. Diethyl ether (with or without butylated hydroxytoluene
(BHT) stabilization) was the most desirable solvent for the rearrangement,
and the other common ether solvents, THF and Me-THF, produced low
or no yields of 2.

a Standard conditions:
0.2 M in Et2O (stabilized with 5 ppm BHT), −78 °C
to room
temperature (rt), 1 equiv of FeCl2 and 3 equiv of nucleophile.

b 1 equiv of the aryllithium
was used.

c 1 equiv of BHT
was added.

d 10 mol % of FeCl2.

e Solvent was diethyl
ether without
BHT.

Colder temperatures
(entry 10) allowed for the formation of the
1,2-addtion product, 3, but hindered the formation of
the desired rearranged product, 2. Although the
reaction proceeded in both inhibited and purified Et2O,
the addition of 1 equiv of BHT further hindered the reaction (entry
11), indicating that the BHT preservative was not involved in the
reaction, and that commercial, stabilized ether was a suitable solvent
for the addition/migration. The reduction of the loading of FeCl2 from 1 equiv to 10 mol % resulted in an 8% yield (entry 13),
indicating that the reaction required a stoichiometric amount of the
iron reagent.

The scope and limitations of the addition-rearrangement
with respect
to both linear and cyclic α,β unsaturated ketone substrates
were also investigated (Table 2). Cycloalkenones were found to be the best substrates, with
cyclohex-2-enone (1) giving the highest yield. Linear
α,β-unsaturated ketones (entries 3–5) produced
only the 1,2-addition product.

Table 2 Substrate Scopea
a Conditions: 0.2
M in Et2O (stabilized with 5 ppm BHT), −78 °C
to rt, 1 equiv
of FeCl2 and 3 equiv of nucleophile.

We then investigated the scope and
limitation of organolithium
and Grignard nucleophiles (Table 3). Alkyllithium reagents did not yield any results,
presumably due to their basicity. The naphthyllithium reagent produced
only the 1,2-addition product 15, indicating that the
1,3 migration may be inhibited due to steric hindrance. Only trace
amounts of the product were obtained from the Grignard reagent (entry
6). We investigated the feasibility of this method using heterocyclic
aryllithiums, and we obtained only a trace amount of products 20 and 22.

a Conditions: 0.2 M in Et2O (stabilized with
5 ppm BHT), −78 °C to rt, 1 equiv

b Aryllithium was synthesized via
lithium–halogen exchange from arylbromide and butyllithium.

To probe the mechanism of the
reaction, the biphenyl lithium reagent
was added to 1 and stirred for 3 h. Purification by flash
chromatography gave 3. FeCl2 (1 equiv) was
then added to a solution of 3 (1 equiv), and the reaction
was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, providing 2 after
column chromatography (Scheme 2). This confirmed that the tertiary allylic alcohol (3) was an intermediate for the rearrangement.

Scheme 2 Stepwise
Reaction
Furthermore, the use
of a chiral α,β-unsaturated ketone
indicated that the OH-migration was diastereoselective. 6-Methylcyclohexenone, 23, was reacted with phenyllithium to produce a 1:1 mixture
of diastereomers 24 and 25 (as judged by
1H NMR of the crude reaction mixture). Of the two possible diastereomers,
only 24 could be isolated by flash chromatography. When
this stereoisomer was reacted with FeCl2, a 2:1 mixture
of the two diastereomeric migration products (26 and 27) was obtained. NOESY NMR spectroscopy revealed that the
major diastereomer retained the anti-relationship between the methyl
group and the alcohol. This indicates that the 1,3-migration proceed
primarily via a syn-facial pathway due to less energy
needed for the iron-oxo species to approach from the same face of
the allylic cation than to approach from the opposite face as the
methyl group to give the syn product (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Diastereoselective
OH-Migration
Based on these data
and the previous work by McCubbin,37 we
propose the mechanism shown in Scheme 4. The organolithium reagent
reacts with the α,β-unsaturated ketone to give the tertiary
alkoxide (1,2-addition). The FeCl2 coordinates to the alkoxide
(28), and LiCl is formed. The iron-oxo species (29) cleaves the C–O bond, forming an allylic carbocation
(30), and the iron-oxo species then attacks the 3-position
of the allylic cation, forming a new C–O bond. The major product
of this process arises from the syn migration of
the iron-oxo species. We hypothesize that the intimate ionic pair
shown in Scheme 4 (30) could explain the formation of both diastereomers (26 and 27) and the preference for the trans isomer
(26). Density functional theory calculations indicate
that both the trans (26) and cis (27) rearranged products have similar ground-state
energies, so the observed 2:1 selectivity likely arises from 
kinetic control. When aryllithium nucleophiles are used, the final
allylic alcohol is conjugated which we believe is the overall driving
force for the reaction.

Scheme 4 Proposed Mechanism for the 1,3-OH-Migration
Finally, the extent of the
OH-migration was investigated. Phenyllithium
was added to a solution of the conjugated dieneone, 32, then after an hour FeCl2 was added. The mixture was
then stirred at room temperature for 24 h, producing 33, a 1,2-addition product, and 34, the product of a 1,5-OH-migration.
The 1,3-migration product (35) was not observed, likely
because it was less conjugated than 33 or 34. This result corroborates the proposed OH-migration mechanism and
confirms that the overall driving force for the reaction is the creation
of an extended conjugated system (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Extent of Migration
Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a novel iron-mediated process that
isomerizes allylic alcohols. The system can be used to effect the
transformation of cyclic α,β-unsaturated enones to 3,3′-disubstituted
allylic alcohols. Future work in this field could involve the enhancement
of the diastereoselectivity of the process and its application to
the synthesis of medicinal compounds.
