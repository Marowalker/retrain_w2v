Noble-metal
nanoparticles size and packing density are critical
for sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and controlled
preparation of such films required to achieve reproducibility. Provided
that they are made reliable, Ag shell on SiO2 microscopic
particles (Ag/SiO2) are promising candidates for lab-on-a-bead
analytical measurements of low analyte concentration in liquid specimen.
Here, we selected nanoporous silica microparticles as a substrate
for reduction of AgNO3 with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES). In a single preparation step, homogeneous and continuous
films of Ag nanoparticles are formed on SiO2 surfaces with
equimolar concentration of APTES and silver nitrate in ethanol. It
is discussed that amine and silane moieties in APTES contribute first
to an efficient reduction on the silica and second to capping the
Ag nanoparticles. The high density and homogeneity of nanoparticle
nucleation is further regulated by the nanoporosity of the silica.
The Ag/SiO2 microparticles were tested for SERS using self-assembled
4-aminothiophenol monolayers, and an enhancement factor of ca. 2 ×
106 is measured. Importantly, the SERS relative standard
deviation is 36% when a single microparticle is considered and drops
to 11% when sets of 10 microparticles are considered. As prepared,
the microparticles are highly suitable for state-of-the-art quantitative
lab-on-a-bead interrogation of specimens.

Introduction
Since its discovery
in 1973,1 the interest
in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has grown steadily over
the years. SERS measures the vibrational spectrum of materials, and
as such is also widely exploited for label-free detection of biologically
relevant materials, with numerous implementations in diagnostics.2−4 SERS is most efficient at the surface of nanostructured noble metals
such as Ag and Au, where intense surface plasmon modes exist and readily
couple with visible or near-infrared radiations. SERS substrates typically
increase the Raman scattering cross section of the molecules that
are adsorbed onto them by an enhancement factor (EF) 105–107,5 with some demonstration
of higher EF and up to values affording detection of single molecule.6,7 In this paper, we investigate a one-step, facile preparation of
microscopic SERS substrates formed on silica microparticles, taking
advantage of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) silane and amine
duality and of nanoscale porosity on the silica surface. Beyond the
silver growth mechanism, we specifically focus on the reproducibility
and SERS efficiency at the level of single microparticles and of a
small amount of microparticles, which are crucial properties to develop
lab-on-a-bead methodology, offering a reliable and flexible analytical
solution to probe small volumes of liquid specimen and microfluidic
channels well beyond the scope of larger substrates.

SERS is
fundamentally a nanoscale process, and it is thus understandable
that poor reliability and repeatability in substrate preparation has
impeded for many years the adoption of SERS in quantitative analytical
applications.8 Yet today, measurements
with relative standard deviation (RSD) up to <10% can be reasonably
easily achieved in laboratories without sacrifice of EF, by preparing
Ag or Au nanostructures in most cases through templates or by microfabrication9,10 and commercialized substrates such as Klarite afford EF of 103–106 and RSD < 10%.11−15

Another widely recognized and not yet fully
overcome limitation
to the deployment of SERS as an analytical technique is the rapid
degradation of the substrates, especially those made with silver.8 As such, low-cost and low-equipment/skill-requirement
preparation is highly desirable so that substrate fabrication can
be decentralized. Reproducible SERS have been repeatedly demonstrated,
but the techniques of manufacture are costly and require a lot of
time and skill, such as, for example, nanolithography, focused ion
beam, holographic laser illumination, and templated substrates,8−10 and are thus hardly transportable. In this context, an ambient,
low-temperature, wet chemical process such as the one discussed in
this paper offers a far more desirable route.

In the chemical
reduction of nanoparticles (NPs) for SERS, Ag or
Au particle size and morphology are determined by experimental parameters,
such as temperature, time, and reagent concentration. Discrete particles
can be easily synthesized, but greater SERS EF comes from the agglomeration
of small particles in clusters with hotspots. Substrates are thus
routinely prepared by addition of aggregating agents such as chlorinated
salts.16,17 Yet, the degree of aggregation is not sufficiently
controllable and analytical performances are thus hindered.18 On the other hand, on glass surfaces, in the
absence of other form of spatial templating, electroless reduction
has also been shown to produce highly reproducible EF.19 The latter approach is low cost, fast, and accessible
to most laboratories, and thus extremely attractive from the point
of view of a cost-effective widely deployable methodology for quantitative
SERS. The formation of nanoparticle films is usually carried out in
several distinct ways. In the seeded growth method, metal seed particles
are formed in separate reactions and are combined with the substrate
in suitable solvents to maximize noncovalent interactions.20−22 Alternatively, the substrate surface is furnished with reactive
species containing amine or mercapto functional groups (usually by
the hydrolysis and condensation of organosilane species) and the seed
nanoparticles bind to these groups due to their high affinity for
these.22−35 Seeding is then followed by electroless plating with the reduction
of salts such as silver nitrate (AgNO3) or gold chloride
hydrate, utilizing various reducing agents such as citrate or ascorbic
acid.20 Other methods include the sensitization
of dielectric surfaces with stannous chloride (SnCl2) and
Sn particles in acidic solution onto which the Ag particles can grow.
The latter method does not require a reducing agent, but produces
sparse coatings with wide particle size distribution and needs successive
steps to form homogenous coverage.22 By
contrast, electroless plating in ethanolic solutions of AgNO3 and butylamine leads to continuous Ag coverage on glass two-dimensional
substrate without seeding.19 This reaction
system is beneficial in that there are very few reagents, it is carried
out at low temperature (ca. 50 °C), and it is relatively quick
(ca. 1 h). The reaction has also been applied on magnetic and smooth
silica spheres,36,37 to develop Raman-based markers
in assays. Electroless reduction of AgNO3 in ethanolic
solutions at reflux has also been done with aminosilanes to form discrete
ca. 5 nm silica-capped soluble nanoparticles.38,39 Noble metal and silica structures have been used for many applications,
such as cancer treatment, immunoassay, and theranostics.41−46 The simultaneous growth of silica (or of other negatively charged
surface layers) on silver can also facilitate the formation of other
layers on the nanoparticles. For example, negatively charged poly(acrylic
acid) can activate the surface and afford the deposition of other
materials.47,48 In this paper, we focus on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES) as it can thus presumably be used both as a mild reducing
agent and as a capping agent for growing shells of Ag nanoparticles.

For the analysis of specimen diluted in solutions, beyond solid
substrate-based analysis, SERS is routinely performed by introducing
Ag or Au nanoparticles directly in the liquid.40 Yet, since it is in the aggregation of the nanoparticles
that truly useful EF are achieved16,17,48 and that these remain difficult to control, quantitative
measurements are typically not possible. Within the context of liquid
biopsy, where small volumes of liquid specimen and low analyte concentration
are found, microfluidics offers a convenient control on the specimen
and microfluidic platforms have been made to include SERS-active areas
in so-called hybrid systems.2 There, SERS
substrates suffer from poor recyclability and poor molecule trapping
efficiency and their design and preparation is intimately linked to
the platform fabrication.9 In keeping that
microparticles can be made to mix efficiently with solutions, including
within the notoriously laminar flow in microfluidics49 and that the particles, being prepared separately from
the platform, afford higher repeatability and ease of fabrication,
it seems reasonable for us to focus on their exploitation. Yet, the
lack of repeatability in EF has to be addressed. As such, we are considering
here the case of SERS-active Ag/SiO2 microparticles. Bare
silica microparticles are commercially available with high monodispersity
and controlled surface porosity, and we used those as a template for
electroless deposition.

According to the guidelines of Betz
et al.,18 a truly useful SERS substrate
should be simple to prepare
(from chemicals and equipment found readily in most laboratories)
and should be easily integrated into analytical systems. Within this
context, we report that electroless reduction of AgNO3 in
ethanol with APTES leads to reproducible SERS-active substrates and
we also quantify EF and RSD, including when the microparticles are
considered as individual SERS substrate. The microspheres are easy
to prepare, made from cheap, commercially available reagents, and
lend themselves to analysis into already available analytical systems
in microscopy and in solution (e.g., cuvettes and microfluidics).
The inherent mobility of microparticle SERS substrates is particularly
desirable for the analysis of low volumes of liquid specimens and
should suit a wide range of applications, including microfluidics
and diagnostics.50

Results and Discussion
AgNO3 Concentration
As can be expected,
the AgNO3 concentration plays a significant role in the
structure of the Ag film formed on the SiO2 microparticles. Figure 1a shows a photograph
of a series of Ag/SiO2 microparticle dispersions in ethanol
along with their associated UV–vis extinction spectra, with
the concentration of AgNO3 varied from 0.1 to 2.5 mM and
the APTES concentration set to 1 mM. At lower concentrations (<0.5
mM), the dispersions are very clear and we infer that a negligible
amount or no Ag is formed. The UV–vis spectrum matches then
with that of the bare silica that has very low absorption in the visible
range. With 0.5 mM of AgNO3, the solution turns yellow-brown
and a distinct plasmon band at ca. 440 nm is observed in the extinction
spectrum, suggesting that Ag nanoparticles form. When the concentration
is increased further, the solution darkens and the extinction maxima
shifts to longer wavelengths and broadens, suggesting the formation
of a more continuous Ag film.51−54

Figure 1 (a) Photograph under ambient light of a series of Ag/SiO2 dispersions in ethanol with AgNO3 concentration
varied
(left to right) from 0.1 to 2.5 mM (APTES 1 mM) and corresponding
UV–vis extinction spectra. (b) Same with APTES concentration
varied (left to right) from 0.1 to 2.5 mM (AgNO3 1 mM).

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images in Figure 2a–c reveal the structural
evolution of Ag film. With 0.1 mM AgNO3, the image mostly
shows the high roughness of the nanoporous SiO2 with very
little evidence of Ag nanoparticles. On the other hand, SEM reveals
a uniform coverage of Ag nanoparticles with 1 mM AgNO3.
The relatively spherical Ag particles exhibit a diameter of ca. 20
nm and are densely and uniformly arranged on the nanoporous silica
surface. At higher, AgNO3 concentrations (2 mM), additional,
disperse, and larger Ag particles are also observed. These appear
to have grown above the uniform film of smaller particles. The size
of the large particles scales up to ca. 100 nm.

Figure 2 (a–c) SEM images
of the surface of a silica microparticle
prepared with AgNO3 concentration of 0.1, 1, and 2.5 mM,
respectively (APTES 1 mM). The corresponding microparticles are shown
in the inset. (d, e) SEM images highlighting clusters of Ag nanoparticles
grown in the solution with 1 mM AgNO3 and 0.1 mM APTES,
with little Ag growth on the silica microparticles. (f) Same highlighting
excess materials formed with 1 mM AgNO3 and 2.5 mM APTES.

APTES Concentration
Figure 1b shows a
photograph of a series of Ag/SiO2 dispersions prepared
with concentration of AgNO3 fixed at 1 mM and APTES concentration
varied from 0.1 to 2.5 mM.
The corresponding UV–vis extinction spectra are also shown.
At 0.1 mM APTES, we observe that the solution is light yellow and
that the UV–vis spectra shows a weak peak at 440 nm. These
data suggest that Ag nanoparticles formed, and SEM further reveals
(Figure 2c,d) that
these Ag nanoparticles are majorly reduced in the solution, away from
the nanoporous silica microparticle surfaces. When the concentration
of APTES in further increased, the solution progressively darkens
and the UV–vis spectra also show a progressive shift and broadening
commensurate with the growth of Ag nanoparticle film on the silica
surface. Beyond 1.5 mM APTES, the solution gradually reverts back
to a yellow color and the UV–vis spectra shows the re-emergence
of an intense peak positioned at ca. 440 nm for 2.5 mM APTES. At the
same concentration, the SEM image in Figure 2f reveals large cuboids grown mostly away
from the microparticles, but with also some observed on the silica
microparticles. Noteworthy at concentrations of AgNO3 around
1 mM, SEM and UV–vis data suggest that the Ag nanoparticles
uniformly grow preferably on the microsphere nanoporous surfaces with
little growth in the solution.

Ag Reduction and Nanoparticle
Film Growth Mechanism
Thus, one observes that at constant
APTES concentration (1 mM), increasing
the AgNO3 concentration increases the coverage in nanoparticles
formed on the nanoporous silica surfaces, with NPs size seen to reach
ca. 20 nm at 1 mM and with some additional larger particles up to
ca. 100 nm at 2.5 mM. On the other hand, at constant AgNO3 concentration (1 mM), increasing the APTES concentration shows a
more varied behavior, with Ag NPs preferably reduced in solution at
low concentration, reduced on the silica surface at intermediate concentration,
and competitively reduced again in the solution at higher APTES concentration.

With respect to the silica surface, the reduction mechanism would
likely follow the one described by Kim et al. with butylamine,37 with the difference here that APTES can act
both as reducing (amine moieties) and capping agent (silane moieties).38 Prior to the addition of APTES, the microparticles
are expected to attract the silver ions as the ζ-potential value
suggests that a fair amount of surface OH groups are deprotonated
in ethanol (see Supporting Information, Figure S1a). Upon addition of silver ions, the oxygen sites are thus
bound to Ag+ ions, which then seed the Ag heterogeneous
growth (Figure S1b). Moreover, we have
confirmed that, with the 92 Å silica pores used in this study,
Ag nanoparticles nucleate homogeneously on the silica surface whereas
that is not the case with the 22 Å ones (see Supporting Information, Figure S2), suggesting that selection of appropriate
porosity also affords a control on the Ag NPs’ nucleation density.

In contrast to this work, no evidence of colloid excess in the
solutions was observed in an earlier study where ca. equimolar butylamine
was used to reduce Ag on 200 nm SiO2 microparticles.37 This was attributed to butylamine being a weak
reducing agent. Yet, precipitation of Ag particles have also been
made with APTES and other aminosilanes by others (in the absence of
silica microparticles and at comparatively high concentration of APTES
versus AgNO3).38 We infer thus
that in our APTES-based experiments, a balance between reduction on
the nanoporous silica and reduction in the solution exists, with heterogeneous
growth on the nanoporous silica preferred ca. 1.0 mM APTES. Noteworthily,
ethanol alone is known to serve as a reducing agent although this
is generally seen under microwave assistance or sonication,55,56 in variance to this work. It is thus expected that at sufficient
concentration, APTES is here the dominating reducing agent.

Butylamine is not necessarily advantageous when the properties
of the nanostructured Ag film grown on the microsphere are considered.
Indeed, the Ag films here are homogenous and fully cover the microparticle
surface with suggestions of numerous nucleation sites, whereas sparse
particles coalescing into larger ones were seen with butylamine.37 Here, one can speculate on the role of the silane
moieties. In line with the observations of Frattini et al. also with
other aminosilanes,38 it is suggested that
the silane moieties in APTES act as capping agent when APTES and AgNO3 are approximately equimolar, with the polymerization possible
from a trace amount of water. It is noted that APTES binding and polymerization
is not expected directly on the silica spheres that are initially
covered by Ag+ but to develop more slowly above the Ag
nanoparticle film, capping thus the initially reduced nanoparticles.

SERS versus Ag Reduction
It is known that smooth Ag
surfaces do not provide large EF but that the formation of nanoscaled
asperities and particles, as well as gaps between these, greatly enhance
the Raman spectrum of the adsorbed molecules.57 As such, the Ag film presented above is promising and we discuss
here a series of Raman spectra recorded on Ag-coated microparticles
that are prepared with varied AgNO3 and APTES concentrations
(Figure 3). Following
the Ag growth, the microparticles were exposed to a 4-aminothiophenol
(4-ATP) solution, which is known to lead to the formation of complete
and single monolayers.58 Thus, our Raman
measurements allow for quantifying the EF and microparticle reproducibility
when used as a SERS substrate. The Raman spectra were recorded after
focusing the confocal Raman onto individual microparticles, and the
spectra were also normalized to a silicon peak (ca. 520 cm–1) from the substrate on which the microparticles were drop casted.
Each spectrum shown is the average of 10 measurements on as many microparticles.
The Raman spectra recorded on microparticles is reminiscent of SERS
with two strong peaks at 1390 and 1432 cm–1 that
match with normally forbidden ring modes of 4-ATP and that are appearing
here due to symmetry lowering when the molecule is self-assembled
on Ag surfaces.60 Overall, a good agreement
between our 4-ATP spectrum and other SERS measurements published in
the literature is found.59

Figure 3 (a, b) Color maps showing
the Raman spectra of 4-ATP on Ag-coated
SiO2 microparticles as a function of AgNO3 and
APTES concentrations. The data are normalized, and the lower intensities
are shown in dark red and the highest in white. The spectra were averaged
from 10 individual microparticles. (c) Plot of the 4-ATP 1435 cm–1 Raman mode intensity on Ag/SiO2 microparticles
as a function of AgNO3 concentration (with 1 mM APTES,
blue open circles, RSD for each data point: 14.3, 14.0, 13.8, 12.8,
13.5, 12.2, and 12.9%) and as a function of the APTES concentration
(with 1 mM AgNO3, red dots, RSD for each data point: no
signal, no signal, 21.0, 13.6, 14.7, 14.1, and 12.8%) extracted from
(a) and (b). (d) 4-ATP powder spectra (red) and 4-ATP on Ag/SiO2 microparticle spectra (1 mM APTES and 1 mM AgNO3, blue). The 4-ATP powder spectrum is displayed with a factor ×50
with respect to the scale, and the microparticle spectra is the average
of 10 individual microparticles.

The color maps in Figure 3a,b show Raman spectra for different AgNO3 and
APTES concentrations, respectively. The data were recorded on the
same microparticle preparations as those discussed in Figures 1 and 2, allowing us to accurately correlate the impact of the concentration
of AgNO3 and APTES on the SERS performances. The maps display
the lower Raman intensities in dark red and the highest in white.
The maps show that the Raman intensity is uniformly affected across
all wavenumbers when the AgNO3 or APTES concentration is
changed. The integrated intensity of the peak at 1435 cm–1 was extracted and is plotted in Figure 3c. Overall, we observe that the Raman signal
of 4-ATP peaks at ca. 1 mM APTES and is weaker for APTES concentration
below and above. This behavior is well in agreement with the evolution
of the extinction spectra in Figure 1b and highlights that the Ag coverage is more suitable
to SERS with sufficient APTES for the reduction but not too much that
Ag is also competitively reduced in the solution. We also observed
that, with 1 mM AgNO3, the Raman intensity for all peaks
exhibits a strong increase and that it remains relatively unchanged
afterward, although a slight increase is detected within our experimental
error at 2.5 mM. The evolution of the Raman spectra is thus again
in full agreement with the extinction spectra in Figure 1a. Altogether, a suitable nanostructured
Ag film forms at ca. equimolar concentration in APTES and AgNO3. When the AgNO3 concentration is too high, the
Ag nanoparticle formation is not sufficiently controlled by APTES,
leading to additional broader Ag features (Figure 2c) that are not as efficient for SERS.

SERS Enhancement Factor
It is well recognized that
establishing the EF in SERS for a given system is prone to error and
often overestimation in the reported values.60 However, the EF remains an important metric to establish the potential
sensitivity of the SERS substrate and we develop below our estimation
of the EF on our silvered silica microparticles. Here, we compare
the Raman intensities recorded on individual microparticles on silicon
with a Raman spectra recorded on a deposit of 4-ATP powder on the
same silicon surface and made thicker than the depth resolution of
the microscope. All data are recorded within the same experimental
conditions. The 4-ATP powder spectrum is superposed to the one averaged
on the microparticles and presented in Figure 3b.

The Raman scattering in a specimen
is dependent on the amount of molecule present in the illuminated
volume, and thus first, we estimate the amount of molecules measured
on the powder and on a single microparticle. The Raman microscope
predominantly measures the top cap of the microparticle and thus a
surface area of , where R is the microparticle
radius and r the cap radius. Matching the cap radius
to the Raman excitation beam waist (0.24 μm) and in keeping
that the surface density of adsorbed thiols is typically ca. 4.5 ×
1014 molecules/cm2,61 we estimate that ca. 8 × 105 4-ATP molecules are
present on the microparticle cap. Assuming that a homogeneous cylindrical
volume of 4-ATP powder is measured with a radius matching again with
the Raman excitation beam waist (0.24 μm) and a depth of ca.
1.7 μm and in keeping that the calculated molecular volume of
4-ATP is 1.73 × 10–10 μm3,
one estimates that ca. 2 × 109 4-ATP molecules contribute
to the powder spectra. Overall, thus, there are about 2.5 × 103 times more molecules probed in the normal Raman powder spectra.
Considering the mode at 1573 cm–1 that is clearly
observed in both powder and silvered microparticles and that is ca.
800 times more intense on the microparticles, we estimate that the
EF for 4-ATP is ca. 2 × 106. The EF here is in agreement
with the values found for silvered surfaces prepared by reduction
of AgNO3 by butylamine in ethanol on 250 nm silica microparticles
and on glass with reported EF of ca. 106 and 2 × 105, respectively.37,19

SERS Reproducibility
To test the relative standard
deviation in EF and therefore SERS sensitivity at the level of individual
microparticle and for a discrete sample of microparticles, we have
recorded the 4-ATP Raman spectra on 26 Ag/SiO2 microparticles
prepared by reduction with 1 mM APTES and 1 mM AgNO3 in
two batches (13 from each batch). The microparticles were dispersed
on a silicon surface, and the silicon peak at 520 cm–1 was again used to normalize the individual spectra. When considering
the intensity of the Raman peak at 1432 cm–1, the
RSD for the series of 26 spectra is 36%. The value is thus an indication
of the accuracy in an analytical context when a single microparticle
is considered as a SERS substrate. Most experimental situations would
involve the recovery and or in situ analysis of more than one microparticle;
however, when considering the averaged spectra made of a series of
randomly picked 10 microparticles, we calculate that the RSD is 11%
(see Supporting Information, Figure S3).

Conclusions
This paper focuses on the reduction of AgNO3 on nanoporous
silica microparticles in ethanol in the presence of APTES for the
development of mobile SERS microsubstrates. The one-step preparation
is simple, safe to perform, and relies on widely available and low-cost
chemicals and materials. Equimolar amount of AgNO3 and
APTES produces reproducible film of ca. 20 nm Ag nanoparticles densely
arranged on the microparticle surface with EF ca. 2 × 106 and RSD 36% when a single Ag/SiO2 microparticle
is considered (including from different preparation batches).

It is speculated that the surface roughness inherent to the 92
Å pores and the silane moieties in APTES contribute to controlling
the homogeneous growth on the silica surface,38 whereas the amine moieties participate in the reduction, as observed
for butylamine by others.19,3 Extinction spectra,
SEM images, and Raman spectra measured when varying the concentration
of AgNO3 and of APTES suggest that equimolar concentration
better confines the growth to the silica surfaces, with uncontrolled
development of >100 nm large Ag islands appearing at high AgNO3 concentration and with growth of Ag/silica cuboid in solution
at high APTES concentration.

A potential application of the
Ag/SiO2 microparticle
is within the context of a lab-on-a-bead methodology, where single
beads are sufficiently SERS efficient and reproducible to warrant
quantitative analysis from fluids in which the microparticles would
be introduced. Silica microparticles are also available with super-paramagnetic
cores so that magnetic recovery is possible.36 As such, one notes that the microscopic size of the beads is ideal
for optical interrogation at the level of individual particles. Moreover,
the surface area is sufficiently large to afford statistically relevant
amount of nanostructuring and gaps in the Ag film to achieve both
large EF and reproducibility. Noteworthily, other authors have used
silvered surfaces when interrogating biological specimens and it is
foreseen thus that our microparticles will also successfully probe
biological fluids.62,63 The microparticles have thus
the flexibility of nanoparticles to sensitively probe solution whilst
avoiding the need for in situ aggregation for EF increase.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Monodispersed silica microspheres (ca. 1.5
μm diameter) were purchased from Glantreo (92 Å average
pore diameter). Silver nitrate 99% (AgNO3), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES), ethanol 200 proof, 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP), and sodium
chloride (NaCl) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Water was purified
by a Milli-Q system and had a resistance of 18.2 MΩ/cm.

Ag Reduction
SiO2 microspheres were Ag-coated
using ethanolic solutions of AgNO3, with APTES as a mild
reducing agent. APTES is an amine-functionalized organosilane. The
SiO2 microparticles surfaces are furnished with negatively
charged hydroxyl groups, which are formed during the hydrolysis and
condensation reaction of the Stöber process in water/ethanol
mixtures. These provide electronic attraction for the positively charged
Ag+ ions. The amines act as electron donors that reduce
the Ag+ ions to elemental Ag0 nanoparticles
at the silica surface and act as a stabilizing agent. These particles
thus form on the silica surface without the need of pretreatment or
sensitizing. Specifically, silica microspheres of an average of 1.5
μm diameter were dried for 24 h at 120 °C in a vacuum oven
and then dispersed in 99.9% ethanol. This dispersion was washed three
times in absolute ethanol with centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, before being redispersed in ethanol under
sonication for 5 min. The spheres were added to AgNO3 solution
in ethanol and mixed thoroughly before addition of APTES. The final
concentration of silica spheres was ca. 0.1 mg/mL. The solutions were
placed in polypropylene tubes and heated at 50 °C for 50 min
with agitation at 200 rpm in a shaking incubator. The dispersions
were then washed three times in fresh ethanol with centrifugation
and redispersed in fresh ethanol under sonication. The concentrations
of AgNO3 and APTES were both varied between 0.1 and 2.5
mM.

Thiol Functionalization
The organic thiol SAMs were
grown according to standard procedures in the literature.61 Fifteen milliliter polypropylene tubes with
10 mL of 0.1 mg/mL Ag/SiO2 were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were redispersed in 5 mL of
fresh ethanol under sonication for 5 min before addition of 5 mL of
2 mM 4-ATP in absolute ethanol. The tubes were vortexed and placed
in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm for 12 h at 25 °C. The tubes
were then centrifuged and washed three times with fresh ethanol. The
pellets were finally resuspended in fresh ethanol under sonication
for 10 min.

Ag/SiO2 Microparticle Characterization
UV–vis
extinction spectra were acquired using a Thermo Scientific Evolution
201 spectrophotometer with Hellamax Quartz absorption cells (between
350 and 1000 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired
using a Hitachi SU-70 field emission scanning electron microscope.
The samples were drop casted on a commercially available gold-coated
silicon substrate (Georg Albert, GmbH) and dried overnight in a desiccator.
The images were recorded at 3 keV.

Raman/SERS Microspectroscopy
For SERS measurements,
the 4-ATP functionalized spheres were dispersed and dried on polished
silicon substrates. Si has no Raman/fluorescence background that can
interfere with the 4-ATP Raman spectra, and its Raman peak at ca.
520 cm–1 was used to normalize all Raman/SERS spectra
for any quantitative analyses. SERS measurements were carried out
using a high-resolution Raman spectrometer (LabRam HR Evolution) from
Horiba Scientific equipped with a highly sensitive Synapse CCD detector
(Horiba Scientific). SERS spectra were acquired in reflection using
an infinity-corrected long working distance objective (50× NA
0.55 HCXP PL FLUOTAR, Leica), a green laser (532 nm) with a power
of ca. 6 μW at the sample, and a typical acquisition time of
1 s. The spectra were accumulated 3× and averaged for a better
signal-to-noise ratio and to remove any cosmic spikes. The Raman spectrum
of an optically thick, compact 4-ATP powder film was also acquired
to estimate the SERS EF on the microparticle.
