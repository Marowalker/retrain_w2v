A family
of hybrid organoinorganic silica-based particles with
varied chemical natures and morphologies has been synthesized to test
their ability to develop coatings with underwater hydrophobicity.
The particles were characterized by elemental microanalysis, scanning
electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering to evaluate the
organic content, observe the morphology, and estimate the aggregate
size, respectively. These morphologies were transferred into surface
topographies by spraycoating dispersions made from the particles onto
glass supports, resulting in coatings with an ample range of profiles
and roughness but all of them being superhydrophobic. Atomic force
microscopy and optical profilometry were used to map the coating surfaces
and analyze the topography. Then, underwater hydrophobicity endurance
was tested by immersion under a 2 cm 20 °C water column perpendicular
to circular glass supports coated with the particles. The so-called
mirror effect derived from the occurrence of the primary plastron
(continuous air layer occluded between the surface and the water)
was observed on the surface of all of the coatings tested. Apart from
the dependency of plastrons on the water temperature and substrate
shape, the plastron quality and lifetime is notably different depending
on the particle morphology and thus on the coating topography. These
experiments have demonstrated that the most persistent mirror effects,
and therefore underwater superhydrophobicity, were produced on coatings
that exhibited the smoothest topographies at the micrometric scale.
In addition, these particle-only coatings can be made mechanically
stable and robust by blending with a polymer matrix.

Introduction
Research on superhydrophobic
surfaces is currently an attractive
topic not only because of the many issues that remain to be understood
but also because of their vast technological implications, such as
water repellent, self-cleaning, antifouling, anticorrosive, drag reduced,
or anti-icing surfaces among others.1,2 The term superhydrophobic
accounts for a surface that presents an apparent (global) water contact
angle above 150° and a hysteresis (the difference between advancing
and receding water contact angles, which gives an idea of the water
adhesion to the surface) under 10°.3 These surfaces behave as totally water repellent due to the combination
of two circumstances: low surface energy chemistry and a characteristic
surface roughness. The development of such a surface is nowadays quite
straightforward by using different approaches, for example, lithography,
chemical etching, electrospinning, phase separation, crystallization,
particle deposition, layer by layer, etc.4 However, what is more complex is to meet, together with the superhydrophobic
character, some other desirable requirements, such as mechanical stability,
transparency, or resistance to long water contact or immersion. The
latter is probably the most intriguing factor because it is less well
known and underexplored but is extremely useful in practice.

During the first half of the 20th century, research on the respiration
of aquatic insects led to the discovery of gas plastrons stuck to
the insects, that is, an air cushion trapped in between water and
the insect’s body that could be sustained, even for years,
because of gas being extracted from aerated water.5 It was not until 2006 that an attempt to produce a synthetic
material able to mimic such a mechanism was published by Shirtcliffe
et al.,6 who presented a submerged methyltrimethoxysilane
foam able to extract gases from water, as insects do. In 2007, a different
strategy consisting of the galvanic deposition of a metal on a metallic
substrate was employed by Bell and co-workers,7 who claimed to be the first to report the mirror-like reflection
(mirror effect), which can be visualized on the submerged surface
at a certain glancing angle because of the total internal reflection
caused by the different refraction index of water and the trapped
air in the plastron. Since 2009, when the first quantitative measurements
of plastron reflectivity decay were published,8 the number of articles dealing with plastrons on synthetic materials
has largely increased, both because of the novelty of the phenomenon
(in synthetic materials) and because of its many technological implications,
such as underwater breathing, antifouling or anticorrosive applications,
drag reduction, nonsticking coatings, for example for packaging applications,
etc.

Even though the principles for plastron development and
regeneration
over time had been studied almost a century before in insects, much
of the work published since 2008 on the duration of plastrons underwater
does not describe the experiments sufficiently, and except for the
pressure of the water column, other basic experimental parameters
(temperature or aeration of water) are frequently not mentioned. Bobji
et al.,9 who studied the possibility of
synthetic materials maintaining plastrons for long times, described
that the experiment is carried at 20 °C in deionized water that
is left standing for a couple of days prior to its use. However, they
did not mention the influence of temperature nor found differences
in plastron duration when aerating the water. Poetes et al.10 were the first to actually visualize the air
plastron on a Teflon surface as it decays by using confocal microscopy.
They were able to show how the primary plastron is, as time goes by,
transformed into many air caps that characterize a secondary plastron.
They presented data on the duration of the plastron as a function
of depth, but they did not mention the temperature of the experiments,
although they did say that the plastron is very dependent on conditions
like aeration of the water or flow.

Highlighting a difference
between primary and secondary plastrons,
as these authors do, is not banal because although all underwater
applications rely on long-term hydrophobicity, not all of them rely
on it in the same way, and although antifouling or anticorrosion can
be very possibly achieved effectively with secondary plastrons, other
applications, such as nonsticking coatings, drag reduction, or underwater
breathing, require a significant and continuous layer of trapped air,
i.e, a primary plastron. In this regard, plastron reversibility is
also of great interest. In 2011,11 the
first work (as far as we know) on the reversibility of the Cassie
Wenzel transition appeared, in the context of the application of underwater
superhydrophobicity to microfluidics. In this work, the effect of
pressure (increase and decrease) on plastron formation is studied,
and it is seen that a decrease in pressure can lead to the formation
of a plastron after it is lost, what they believe is proof of a Wenzel–Cassie
transition. In recent years, more evidence on the dynamics of plastrons
has been provided.12,13 However, it is still not clear
whether there is real reversibility, as the dynamics of plastrons
seem to evidence in these two last works for example, or not, as other
authors suggest.14,15 Molecular simulations of density
fluctuations indicate, according to some authors, that spontaneous
dewetting and recovery of the plastron may occur.16

Because plastron occurrence is a relatively new phenomenon
in synthetic
materials, experimental evidence of its characteristics is still very
necessary. Recently, we have studied how the control of the aggregate
size of surface-modified organosilica particles enables the production
of transparent superhydrophobic coatings17,18 with similar surface chemistry, which can develop a large variety
of topographical features. In this work, we evaluate their underwater
hydrophobicity in shallow water experiments and their ability to produce
and sustain well-developed plastrons. The aim is the study of the
influence of experimental factors such as geometry of the substrate,
or water temperature and water temperature variations in plastron
duration, and the identification of the topographical features most
relevant in this phenomenon, which will help to design and build a
stable and long-lasting underwater superhydrophobic surface.

Results
and Discussion
The methodology applied proposes to synthesize
two types of organosilica,
soft and hard particles.19 Soft organosilicas
consist of flexible and deformable agglomerates that can interpenetrate
each other, and they can be built by condensation reactions using
a silica precursor, such as tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), or by
surface modification of commercial silica nanoparticles. On the contrary,
hard organosilicas organize themselves into impenetrable and undeformable
particles or aggregates, and they can be synthesized by condensation
reactions with TEOS and/or organic comonomers. Hard organosilicas
are discrete entities whereas soft organosilicas organize themselves
into entities (aggregates and agglomerates)20,21 that are pliable and easily deformed by external stresses, including
swelling when in contact with certain solvents.

Both types of
particles allow control over the topography of the
coatings obtained after the deposition of the particles onto the substrate22 and also the preparation of the ample variety
of topographies required for the purpose of this work.

Table 1 collects
the characterization of the modified silica particles and coatings
employed in this work: organic incorporation (organic mass (OM%))
determined by elemental analysis, size and polydispersity measured
in an ethanol dispersion by dynamic light scattering (DLS), contact
angles of the coatings, and underwater mirror duration. All of these
coatings have in common that they show θw >
150°, that water droplets effortlessly
roll off (Δθ values are not reported for the sake of simplicity
but they are under 10° in all cases), and that they are able
to sustain a primary plastron, even if it is a short-lived one (see Table 1). For the rest, the
coatings have been prepared to be as diverse as possible to evaluate
the structural features associated with the development and evolution
of plastrons. Four different synthetic methods and four different
organic modifiers have been employed, leading to organosilica particles
and aggregates whose structure, organic incorporation, size, and polydispersity
are strongly varied.

The synthetic method
and the modifier obviously determine the OM%,
which varies from less than 8 wt % to almost 40 wt %. Physisorption
is the less effective method to incorporate organic mass for the same
modifier, compare samples P7, Sm7, and Fm7. On the contrary, fluoride-catalyzed
condensation results in the highest OM%. Increasing the molar mass
of the modifier mostly results in an increase in OM%, see for example,
P662 compared to P7 or Sm57 compared to Sm7. It also has to be taken
into account that in samples obtained by physisorption, the organic
mass is attached to the outer surface, because they are synthesized
from silica particles by surface physisorption of the modifier. In
the condensation methods, TEOS is supposed to act as a cross-linker
preventing the growth of long siloxane chains,23 although “core–shell” and other different
structures have also been described in this kind of co-condensation
reaction.24,25 The organosilicas prepared in these ways
will range from the “hard” to the “soft”,
a characteristic which will be of importance when preparing the coatings
with them.

The 29Si cross-polarization/magic-angle
spinning (CP/MAS)
NMR spectra of some representative samples are collected in Figure 1. The spectra exhibit
two characteristic resonance regions,26,27 the inorganic
region, Q, centered at around −105 ppm, assigned to silanols,
Si(O)4–x(OH)x, siloxane groups, and Si(O)4, and the organic
region, D, associated with Si(C)2(O)2 siloxane
groups at around −20 ppm. The structure of both regions depends
on the synthetic method and the modifier employed. Uncondensed silanols
(signals Q3 and Q2 at −100 and −90
ppm, respectively) are more visible in the samples prepared by physisorption
and Stöber condensation, whereas fluoride-catalyzed reactions
seem to result in significant TEOS condensation (Q region appears
practically as a single band centered at the position of the Q4 species, Si(OSi)4, around −110 ppm). Regarding
the D region, it is known that free liquid-like polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) units appear at −22 ppm,28 so the closer the signal is to −22 ppm, the higher the mobility
of the chains. As expected, P662, modified with the longest PDMS chain,
exhibits a D region centered the closest to −22 ppm, indicating
that the modifier chains represent relative free motion. On the contrary,
the particles prepared with poly(trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane) (PTFPMS),
either by fluoride or Stöber condensation, are those whose
D region appeared broader and centered at low field, showing a more
restricted environment of the siloxane units. In any case, the modifier
was successfully incorporated into the particle in all of the samples,
giving rise to a hybrid structure. The only nonhybrid particle is
SMTMS (NMR spectrum shows only an organic region, T, centered at −60
ppm),29 produced by the self-condensation
of a trifunctional organosilane (methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS)).

The large number and variety of
samples, all of them superhydrophobic,
allows comparison of the different surface features and searching
for those that can best provide long-term underwater hydrophobicity.
With this objective in mind, we carried out experiments consisting
of immersing the coatings under a 2 cm water column and studying the
formation and duration of an air plastron. Pictures showing the aspect
of the coatings a few minutes after immersion are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Pictures showing the
underwater mirror effect of some of the coatings
prepared with the synthesized particles.

All of the prepared coatings produce well-developed plastrons
under
the immersion conditions described in the Experimental
Section, visualized as “mirrors” appearing on
the sample surface at given glancing angles. Differences in the uniformity
of the mirrors throughout the sample surfaces are seen depending on
the particles, and some of them are even able to very easily produce
large macroscopic primary plastrons (see, for example, P7, Sm7, and
SmF in Figure 2).

However, the most notable difference among the samples is the mirror
lifetimes, which are listed in Table 1. Figure 3 presents three pictures showing how the quality, continuity, and
homogeneity of the mirror in the SmF coating is lost with time. After
losing the large macroscopic primary plastron covering the whole sample
(Figure 3a), smaller
macroscopic plastrons remain that are still able to produce clear
image reflections (Figure 3b). Reflexivity progressively decreases as the macroscopic
plastrons are lost, and the surface acquires a silvery aspect that
is characteristic of the development of many small submacroscopic
air caps that give rise to the silver shine (Figure 3c). When the surface appears that way, the tmirror is considered to end in this work, even
if the surface may still be reflecting light to a certain extent.

Figure 3 From left
to right: Time evolution of the appearance of the mirror
in the SmF coating (a) minutes after immersion, (b) 28 h after immersion,
and (c) >50 h after immersion.

Before getting into details, it is worth mentioning that
experiments
estimating mirror lifetimes have to be well defined, so that comparison
between different samples makes sense (or comparison between results
from different laboratories). Although efforts to quantify the reflection
from the plastron have been done,8 experimental
factors that very strongly influence its duration are often overlooked.
Actually, the main dependency of the plastron and the mirror effect
duration is definitively the height of the water column (the pressure
endured by the air layer), which is well reported in the literature.9,10 We decided to use a relatively small water column (2 cm) so that
we could study an ample set of coatings, including those where plastrons
were formed but lasted for very short times. Otherwise, if a higher
water column had been used, the mirror could have disappeared even
during the filling of the container, and the experimental parameters
would not be well defined.

It is easy to see that the duration
of plastrons depends very strongly
on the temperature at which the experiment is done, and small variations
of a couple of degrees can lead to strong differences in plastron
lifetime. However, this is often not controlled (or not reported)
in the results appearing in the literature. Figure 4 shows the evolution with temperature of
the mirrors on the coatings prepared with FmFS particles. To check
reproducibility of the properties, five circular coatings were sprayed
onto a microscope slide. It can be clearly observed that increasing
the water temperature concomitantly improves the extension of the
reflective surface, from a section of the circular coating at 22 °C
to the whole coating at 45 °C. This is not surprising as temperature
affects the solubility of the gases dissolved in water, the air layer
volume, and the release of occluded air in the coatings to the air
layer, all of which affect the amount of trapped air.

Figure 4 Evolution with water
temperature of the mirrors on the coatings
prepared with FmFS particles. Five circular coatings were sprayed
on a microscope slide with the aid of a mask to check reproducibility
of the experiments.

We have also checked
the effect of the coating geometry (in our
case, substrate) on plastron lifetime, which, to the best of our knowledge,
has not been done before. It was found that mirrors are significantly
better developed on circular substrates than on square or rectangular
substrates. Figure 5 compares the mirror effect on circular and square substrates coated
with FmFS particles. It can be seen that on the circular substrate,
it is possible to see the reflection of the number scale on the beaker
that contains the substrate, implying the formation of a large primary
plastron, whereas the silver shine on the square substrate and the
lack of a mirror-like reflection indicates the formation of many air
caps and possibly water repellency, but not of a primary plastron.

Figure 5 Effect
of the substrate geometry (left: 1 cm diameter circle, right:
2 cm side square) on the quality of the mirror effect on coatings
prepared with FmFS particles.

The considerations above led to the experimental setup described
in the Experimental Section: a temperature-controlled
experiment performed on circular substrates of the same size enduring
a small 2 cm water column. These experiments reveal that there is
no direct relationship of the mirror lifetimes collected in Table 1 with either the type
of modifier or the OM%. This suggests that, within the set of samples
selected for this study, the chemical nature is not ultimately responsible
for the underwater behavior of the coatings. For the samples in this
work, all of them being superhydrophobic, the key point seems to be
rather the morphology of the surface of the coating, which can be
visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging.

Figure 6 gathers
SEM images of the surfaces of the coatings prepared from some of the
particles collected in Table 1. At this scale, it can be seen that the morphologies are
quite diverse: P7, P662, and PFS (not shown but indistinguishable
from P7) are sponge-like agglomerate nanometric structures of identical
appearance as the original A200 particles.17 Sm7, Fm7, FmF, FmFS, and SmFS (not shown but indistinguishable from
the rest of this subgroup) are also constituted by nanometric structures
consisting of shapeless particles, but differing in their aggregate
size, and SMTMS and Sm57 are spherical particles with and without
nanotexture on the surface.

Figure 6 SEM images of some of the synthesized particles
(scale bars account
for 2 μm).

These images, together
with the aggregate size listed in Table 1, give a realistic
and useful description of the particles. Organosilicas derived from
the modification of A200 (P7, P662, and PFS) are the most representative
examples of soft silicas. P7 and PFS organize themselves into the
smallest and less polydisperse (low Pdi) soft aggregates, both show
the same morphology in SEM imaging, and they only differ in the chemical
nature of the modifier. P662 is morphologically similar to these ones,
but it organizes into much larger aggregates. Actually, P662 forms
the biggest aggregates of the particles listed in Table 1. Sm57 and SMTMS are discrete
and hard spherical microparticles, homogeneous in size (low Pdi),
the latter bigger than the former. The rest of the particles, i.e.,
those nondiscrete particles prepared by chemisorption, are of similar
morphology according to SEM imaging, with aggregates of very heterogeneous
sizes according to DLS (Pdi values close to or higher than 0.30).
Their synthesis procedure and characterization suggest that these
aggregates are not as hard as the spherical particles Sm57 and SMTMS,
or as soft as P7 and PFS. It must be pointed out that the aggregate
size of FmFS is the smallest of this group, and its Pdi is among the
smallest, and hence it is the one that most resembles the physisorbed
P7 and PFS.

It is noteworthy that this classification of the
organosilica particles/aggregates
into three groups, i.e, hard and large, soft and large, soft and small,
turns out to be clearly related to the duration of the plastron in
coatings prepared with them. As shown in Table 1, the coatings prepared with hard, spherical
particles (SMTMS and SM57) exhibit the shortest mirror lifetimes,
regardless of their different chemical nature and surface morphology.
Coatings prepared with softer aggregates of similar or even much larger
sizes (e.g., Sm7, FmF, and P662) exhibit plastrons with much longer
lifetimes than those of SMTMS or SM57. Finally, the longest lifetimes
are associated with the smallest and less polydisperse soft aggregates:
P7 > FmFS > PFS; P7 being, by far, the best performing particle
to
sustain a long-lasting air layer on its surface.

Once this direct
connection between the size and polydispersity
of the aggregates/particles and the mirror lifetimes under immersion
is known, the next step is to find out how these parameters (softness,
size, and polydispersity) are transferred into the coating surface
where the plastron develops. To do that, a thorough study of the coating
topographies was done. Two different techniques were employed. Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) analysis is suitable for nanometric length
scales (up to 2 × 2 μm2), but because of the
strong topography (peak–valley distance >1 μm) of
the
samples, optical profilometry was performed to cover higher scales,
and the micrometer (or rather submacroscopic) scale (120 × 150
μm2) was studied by employing the highest optical
objective available (100×). For some of the coatings, it was
impossible to obtain appropriate AFM images even at the 2 × 2
μm2 scale. Table 2 collects the results obtained after the analysis of
the topographic data for some representative coatings.

Section for details).

Figure 7 collects
some examples of AFM cross sections and three-dimensional (3D) images
to better illustrate the roughness of the coatings. This figure and
the data in Table 2 illustrate the differences in roughness profile of the coatings.
Those previously defined as hard silicas (the spherical Sm57 and SMTMS)
present maxima in Rq and f when the analyzed topographic
scale is in the range of the particle diameter (see Figure 7 and Table 2), whereas for soft silicas, the coating
topography is not solely related to the aggregate size but also depends
on its polydispersity and on the aggregate softness, all of which
determine the entities’ ability to pack (and to coat). Assuming
that the topography at the nanoscale can be estimated by the roughness
factor, f,30 it can be
seen that P7, P662, and Fm7 present the largest f0.2 values (it can be supposed that the PFS coating coming, as with
P7 and P662, from the modification of A200 silica would exhibit a
similar f value, however, it was impossible to measure
it by AFM). However, at this scale, both this factor, f, and Rq, which are highest for P662, do not seem to have anything
to do with the mirror lifetimes trend. Both Rq and f at nano- and microscales are typically related to superhydrophobicity,
and as a matter of fact, the highest water contact angle is that of
P662. It is also true that FmFS, which displays one of the most stable
plastrons, has one of the lowest water contact angles (160°).
It seems that although a certain degree of roughness is required to
attain sufficient hydrophobicity for the plastron to be produced,
over this threshold, it is not higher roughness that will make the
plastron last longer.

FmFS, and (e) P7. The color scale in the 3D images is the same for
all of them and goes up to 400 nm high.

Observation of the topography at a larger scale of 1 μm
shows
that P7, the coating with the longest mirror lifetime, is the smoothest
one, with the lowest Rq1 and Rmax1 (see Figure 7), and this is the
first indication of a likely influence on plastron lifetime. At the
larger 150 μm scale, the effect of topography smoothness on
visually detectable plastron duration is even clearer. Actually, the
Rq150 values obtained from the analysis of the profilometer data reveal
an inverse dependence with plastron lifetime; the lower the former,
the longer the latter. In fact, Rmax150
is the parameter that better fits with the mirror lifetimes, and the
dependency is represented in Figure 8. It can be observed that when increasing the Rmax of the coatings, the mirror lifetimes decrease.
Given that in this work, we are studying large visually detectable
plastrons, i.e., plastrons occurring in the macroscopic scale, it
is not surprising that an inverse dependence of their duration with
the Rmax at submacroscopic scale is found. Figure 8 also shows that
not all of the organosilicas represented fit the same dependency,
and Sm57, which has a very low Rmax at
150 μm, displays the plastron for a very short time (Sm57 appears
at the lower right hand side corner of the graph). This illustrates
that another requirement for long-lasting plastrons to develop is
a minimum roughness, which can be characterized by a sufficiently
high roughness factor f or by Rq at submacroscopic
scales. Sm57 presents a very low f150 value (f = 1.1) at this scale (far larger than its particle diameter),
and it cannot be fitted in the trend depicted in Figure 8 for the soft organosilicas,
all of which have f150 ≥1.5.

Figure 8 Mirror lifetimes vs Rmax150 for the
particle coatings in Table 2. The particle–polymer coating PS30FmFS70 is the red
point. The dotted line is a mere guide for the eyes.

SEM images of coating sections of P7, PFS, Fm7,
and FmFS are presented
in Figure 9. This figure
also contains 150 μm cross-sectional data as obtained by optical
profilometry of the same coatings. The comparison of these coatings
is very interesting because (i) Fm7 particles are similar in size
to P7, PFS, or FmFS, (ii) the Fm7 coating presents a similar value
of f0.2 as that of P7, showing nanometric roughness
(also assumed in PFS), not detected in FmFS, (iii) roughness parameters
at the long scale (150 μm) are significantly larger for Fm7
than for the other three coatings, and (iv) the mirror lifetime in
Fm7 is four times shorter than that in FmFS and about 10 times shorter
than that in P7. The SEM images show that P7, PFS, and FmFS present
regular sections, as observed by SEM and optical profilometry, with Rmax150 values of around 10 μm. In contrast,
Fm7 presents an inhomogeneous section with large agglomerations that
can be over 20 μm in height. In the light of this evidence and
as the chemical nature does not play an important role in the mirror
effect of this set of particles (P7 and Fm7 are actually synthesized
using the same modifier), the conclusion drawn is that the Fm7 particles
are more difficult to pack into a regular and “smooth”
coating, and this is the reason behind the short duration of the mirror
effect in this coating. The “packing” (or “coating”)
ability of the particles will rely not only on the aggregate size
but also on its polydispersity, which is notably larger in Fm7 compared
to that of the other three particles in Figure 9. Fm7 particles are very heterogeneous in
size, and this fact is transferred into a steep roughness profile22 (even visualized as gaps in the coating section
in the SEM image of Figure 9), which impedes the formation of a long-lasting plastron.

Figure 9 SEM images
of sections of some coatings (scale bar is 10 μm).
One representative cross section obtained from optical profilometry
for the same coating is under each SEM image. The air layer height
required for the development of the mirror effect (primary plastron)
is depicted in the cross sections.

Bearing in mind the physical process behind the mirror effect
as
studied in this work, namely, the eye visualization of a continuous
mirror formed by the air plastron, it is quite obvious that the control
parameter is Rmax rather than Rq. The
higher the Rmax values, the thicker the
plastron required to visualize a homogeneous mirror, and the sooner
the primary plastron will lose continuity as the air layer becomes
thinner because of water pressure. The air plastron height required
to develop a continuous mirror on the surface coating is depicted
in the cross sections in Figure 9. Once the plastron is not continuous, the mirror becomes
deteriorated until it is completely lost. This finding demonstrates
that, given a superhydrophobic surface (which requires f or Rq to be over a minimum threshold), the key for a long-lasting
primary plastron is not a very high roughness factor, as the theory
suggested,31 but a homogeneous and relatively
smooth topography.

The question remains as to whether the primary
plastron is reversible
once it is lost or, in other words, what happens to the hydrophobicity
of the surface when the mirror/air plastron disappears. To shed some
light on this important issue, we checked that in the samples studied
in this work, the mirror effect is a reversible event, meaning that
after the mirror is lost or deteriorated, it can be recovered by exposing
the coating to air and filling again with water. One example is shown
in the pictures of Figure 10. Figure 10a is a picture of the mirror on a coating of P7 particles just after
filling the water column. Figure 10b shows the same coating after 100 h under immersion.
The mirror is still there but it does not cover the whole coating
surface. Figure 10c shows the appearance of the same coating after removing the water
column and immediately filling again with fresh water. The mirror
appears to be homogeneous and undistinguishable from that in Figure 10a. Therefore, the
coating is still able to sustain an air layer even after losing or
partially losing the mirror. This implies that the plastron (or mirror)
is lost in these cases because of the decreasing of the air layer
thickness and not because of wetting (not even partial) of the surface.

Figure 10 Pictures
showing the appearance of the mirror on coatings prepared
with P7 particles: (a) minutes after immersion, (b) after 100 h of
immersion, and (c) after removing the water and filling the container
again.

In this regard, we have checked
that coatings prepared with P7,
PFS, or FmFS can be underwater for months (in the case of P7, at least
6 months) and still be superhydrophobic immediately after removing
the water, without drying the coating.

Therefore, it can be
stated that although the presence of a primary
plastron is an indication of a very hydrophobic underwater surface,
the disappearance of the primary plastron after a given time is not
an indication of the lack of superhydrophobicity of a surface exposed
to water. This has important consequences, and it makes the design
of new experiments to estimate the persistence of underwater hydrophobicity
necessary. This is important not only for academic purposes, but also
to evaluate the adequacy of given materials for specific applications.

The process of removing the water column and filling it again (to
check the formation of a new mirror or to check the hydrophobicity
of the surface after immersion) requires robust coatings that do not
suffer damage after several cycles. This is definitively not the case
for coatings prepared only with organosilica particles and no binder.
A way to solve this problem would be to use double sided tape to stick
the coating to the substrate, as reported in a recent study,32 which is rather limited as regards applicability,
or our preferred option, which is the mixture of the particles with
a polymer matrix acting as a particle binder.17 In this particular case, the FmFS particles were mixed with polystyrene
at a weight ratio of 30:70 (PS/FmFS). The last column of Table 2 and Figure 11 collect some information
on this coating.

Figure 11 a) SEM image and (b) 3D AFM image (2 × 2 μm2) of the coating PS30FmFS70, (c) cross sections obtained from
optical
profilometry of this coating (in dark cyan) compared to the coating
from the FmFS particles (in blue), and (d) picture showing the behavior
with water of the coating.

The results show that after mixing with the polymer, the
roughness
parameter Rmax of the coating at 150 μm
increases, and concomitantly, there is a decrease in mirror lifetime
compared to that of the only-particle coating. The mirror lifetime
of the PS30FmFS70 coating is around 72 h and its plastron lifetime
follows the trend shown in Figure 8, where PS30FmFS70 appears plotted in red. Therefore,
even if PS30FmFS70 incorporates a non-negligible amount of polymer
binder, as regards plastron lifetime, it belongs to the same family
of coatings as the rest of the soft organosilicas in Figure 8 (contrary to what happens
to the hard organosilica Sm57), and indeed its roughness factor is f150 ≈ 1.5, like other members of the family. Together
with a very remarkable underwater hydrophobicity, PS30FmFS70 has good
mechanical stability and can be handled without risk of damage (see Figure 11d and Movie, SI), and it represents a very promising
approach to long-lasting robust underwater superhydrophobic materials.

Conclusions
The underwater hydrophobicity of a family of hybrid organic–inorganic
silica-based particle coatings has been studied, and in particular,
their ability to develop primary plastrons under immersion, a continuous
air layer occluded between the coating surface and the water column.
The family includes soft, pliable organosilicas derived from the physisorption
of siloxane and fluorosiloxane chains, hard spherical organosilicas,
and other organosilicas in between those two limit morphologies. These
particles have been used to prepare circular superhydrophobic coatings
by spraying. The topographic parameters at the nano- and microscales
have been measured, and underwater hydrophobicity endurance has been
tested using a shallow 2 cm 20 °C water column. A primary plastron,
characterized by the so-called mirror effect, appears in all of the
samples. Strong effects of the water temperature and the geometry
of the coating on the endurance of the primary plastron were detected,
whereby plastrons developed much better at higher temperatures and
in circular coatings. Once the lifetime of the plastron was studied
by well controlled experiments, it was possible to detect, within
this family of organosilicas, a strong dependency of its duration
(×350 h) on the smoothness of the coatings, as characterized
by the lowest Rmax and Rz values in surfaces
of 120 × 150 μm2. The air plastrons prove to
be reversible when the water column is removed and immediately refilled,
which evidences that superhydrophobicity remains after the loss of
primary plastrons. Furthermore, it was checked that some of the coatings
remain superhydrophobic after 6 months underwater immersion. A polymer
composite with polystyrene and one of the particles was prepared,
and it was shown that it behaves in the same way as the particle-only
coatings, exhibiting a durable primary plastron together with remarkable
mechanical stability.

To sum up, this work provides useful experimental
insights for
the optimal design of long-lasting underwater superhydrophobic surfaces
required in several application fields of superhydrophobicity.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Hydrophilic fumed silica, A200, kindly supplied
by Degussa, silanol-terminated oligodimethylsiloxane of 7, 57, and
662 repeat units as average, PDMS-7, PDMS-57, and PDMS-662, respectively,
silanol-terminated poly(trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane) (PTFPMS) from
ABCR, Fluorolink E10-H from Solvay, methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS),
TEOS supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, and polystyrene (PS, Styrolution 168N)
were all used without further purification. Solvents for reactions,
filtration, and chromatography were certified ACS grade and were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

and comonomers in the condensation reactions.

Scheme 1 Preparation of Organosilicas
Surface
Modification
The surface modification of Aerosil
200 was done as reported in reference.17 Basically, 3 g of A200 and 1.76 g of PDMS-n (n = 7 or 662) or PTFPMS in 200 mL of toluene were magnetically
stirred for 72 h. The resulting organosilicas, Pn (n = 7 or 662) or PFS (PTFPMS as surface modifier),
were isolated from the reaction medium by centrifugation and purified
by means of repetitive washing in dichloromethane and acetone (three
times) and further centrifugation. Finally, materials were dried at
100 °C overnight.

Condensation Reactions
Two different
synthetic approaches
were carried out to prepare the organosilica by condensation reactions:
the conventional Stöber method33 and a fluoride-catalyzed condensation.34

In the sol–gel Stöber method, 3 mL of milli-Q
H2O, 22 mL of ethanol, and 3 mL of NH4OH were
placed in a three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer.
After 30 min of stirring, the appropriate quantities of the organic
modifier and 3 mL of TEOS were added. The mixture was magnetically
stirred for another 21 h at 20 °C. Then, the gel was recovered
by centrifugation, and washed with abundant distilled water up to
pH = 7. Finally, the sample was dried in two steps, first at 100 °C
overnight and then at 250 °C under vacuum for 7 h. Following
this method, four organosilicas were prepared: Sm7 (with 0.47 g of
PDMS-7), Sm57 (with 2.68 g of PDMS-57), SmF (with 0.47 g of Fluorolink),
and SmFS (with 0.47 g of PTFPMS). For the synthesis of Sm57, isopropanol
was used as solvent instead of ethanol.

For the fluoride-catalyzed
condensation, an initial mixture of
TEOS (3 mL), ethanol (4.7 mL), and the comonomer (0.47 g) was mechanically
stirred for 30 min. After that, an aqueous solution of NH4F (0.15 g in 1.5 mL) was slowly added to the organosilicon solution.
The mixture was stirred at room temperature until the gelation took
place (approx. 1 h). Then, the gel was kept aging at 36 °C for
24 h, and finally dried at 150 °C under vacuum for another 24
h. Three organosilicas were synthesized by this method: Fm7 (with
PDMS-7 as comonomer), FmF (with Fluorolink as comonomer), and FmFS
(with PTFPMS as comonomer).

Finally, the organosilica SMTMS
was prepared by a self-condensation
reaction of MTMS. MTMS (0.55 g) was dissolved in 15 mL of H2O milli-Q and 0.025 mL of NH4OH was added to the solution.
The reaction mixture was kept at 20 °C for 24 h. Then, the particles
were isolated by centrifugation, washed with water up to pH = 7, and
dried at 100 °C for 24 h.

Preparation of the Particle
Coatings
Organosilica suspensions
in ethanol at a concentration of 27 mg mL–1 were
stirred at room temperature for 24 h before the deposition on glass
supports by spraycoating with an airbrush AB931 from Sealey. Two different
glass supports were employed, circular glass supports of 1 cm diameter,
and microscope slides onto which circular coatings were sprayed with
the aid of a mask. This was done to check the reproducibility of the
measurements. No significant differences in tmirror were found between these two types of circular coatings.
Square glass slides of 2 cm side were used to check the influence
of the substrate shape on the development of the mirror underwater
immersion.

Preparation of the Polymer–Particle
Coating
The desired amount of FmFS particles to obtain a
70 wt % blend was
added to a previously prepared PS solution in toluene (2.5 wt %).
The mixture was stirred for 3 h and then sprayed onto glass supports
with the airbrush.

Characterization of the Organosilica and
Coatings
The
organic mass (OM%) was calculated from carbon content (C%) obtained
by LECO CHNS-932 equipment, with an error of ±0.3%.

Solid
NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker AvanceTM 400 spectrometer
(Bruker Analytik GmbH Karlsrube, Germany) equipped with a Bruker UltrashieldTM
9.4 T (29Si frequency of 79.49 MHz), 8.9 cm vertical-bore
superconducting magnet. In both cases, 13C and 29Si, CP/MAS NMR spectra were acquired at ambient temperature by using
a standard Bruker broad-band MAS probe. Representative samples were
ground and packed in 4 mm zirconia rotors, sealed with Kel-FTM caps,
and spun at 5 kHz. The 90° pulse width was 3.5–4.5 μs
and, in all cases, high-power proton decoupling was used. All free-induction
decays were subjected to standard Fourier transformation and phasing.
The chemical shifts were externally referenced to tetramethylsilane.

The particle aggregate size, Zave,
and the polydispersity index, Pdi, were evaluated by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments) on
suspensions in ethanol with a particle concentration of 50 μg
mL–1. The values reported are the mean values of
three measurements.

The surface coating morphology was visualized
by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) using a Philips XL30ESEM and a Hitachi SU-8000.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine the surface topography.
The AFM images were obtained with a Veeco Multimode scanning probe
microscope equipped with a Nanoscope IV a controller operating in
tapping mode with a phosphorus-doped silicon cantilever (model RTESP).
Topography at higher length scales were analyzed by optical profilometry
using a Zeta-20 optical profiler (Zeta Instruments) with a 100×
optical objective and 13 nm of vertical resolution. Topographic parameters,
mean square roughness values, Rq, rugosity factor, f, defined as real surface divided by geometric surface, Rz, defined
as the average of the absolute values of the heights of the five highest
profile peaks and the depths of five deepest valleys within the evaluation
length, and Rmax, defined as the largest
vertical distance between the highest peak and the lowest valley in
the profile, were all calculated from the cross sections or 3D images
obtained by optical profilometry and AFM and are average values of
at least five measurements. The x number, in Rqx, Rzx, Rmaxx, and fx, indicates the length
scale (cross section or 3D image side) in microns.

The use of
the topographic parameters above as a characterization
means will only make sense in homogeneous and reproducible coatings
where the topography depends on known and controlled experimental
factors (in this case, solvent and concentration of the dispersion,
processing aid, and particle employed) and not on other accidental
circumstances. A simple test of the homogeneity of the coating consists
of comparing Rz and Rmax, which (i) must
vary in the same way in the different coatings and (ii) cannot be
very different from one another.

Apparent contact angles were
measured with Milli-Q grade water
by the sessile drop method using a conventional drop shape analysis
technique (Attension Theta optical tensiometer). For dynamic measurements
(advancing and receding contact angles required to obtain Δθ),
the initial water drop volume was 5 μL and the volume was increased
up to 10 μL by water disposal at 0.2 μL s–1, recording and analyzing 10 images per second during this process.
A constant contact angle value is achieved, which is considered the
advancing water contact angle. Then, 5 μL of water was removed
at the same rate following an identical analysis protocol that enables
the determination of the receding contact angles. The determination
of the contact angle from the captured images is done by the Young–Laplace
method. The initial water contact angle in static conditions with
a 5 μL volume drop is considered to be θw.
Reported contact angles values were the average of at least five measurements
in different coating regions.

To evaluate the underwater hydrophobicity,
the experiments were
designed as follows. The particles were deposited onto 1 cm diameter
circle glass supports by spraying from ethanol suspensions. The supports
were fixed to the bottom of vials that were filled with a 2 cm water
column. The experiments were run with Milli-Q grade water at 20 °C.
The water temperature was controlled throughout the experiments. In
this work, we estimate the lifetimes of primary or macroscopic plastrons,
namely, continuous air cushions at the interface between the surface
and the water, characterized by the formation of a reflective surface
(mirror effect) on top. The duration of the mirror effect (tmirror) has been determined visually with the
aid of a camera, and corresponds to the ability of the surface to
produce a clear reflection of an image. Pictures of the surface were
regularly taken and they were critically analyzed. When there was
no reflection on top (we eventually checked with an image), the surface
turned greyish, and the experiment was considered to be over. To check
the reproducibility of the experiments, glass slides with five 1 cm
coated circles were sprayed with the aid of a mask. The above reported
experiments were reproduced with these samples and it was checked
that statistical errors on tmirror are
less than 10%. The main source of error in the estimation of tmirror is the overnight time in long-lasting
experiments. In any case, this error is not significant compared to
the differences in tmirror between samples.
The figures will show visual examples of the appearance of the continuous
plastron (mirror) on the surface and its time evolution.
