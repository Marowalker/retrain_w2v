Cytoplasmic dynein, an AAA+ motif containing motor, generates
force
and movement along the microtubule to execute important biological
functions including intracellular material transport and cell division
by hydrolyzing ATP. Among the six AAA+ domains, AAA1 is the primary
ATPase site where a single ATP hydrolysis generates a single step.
Nucleotide states in AAA3 gate dynein’s activity, suggesting
that AAA3 acts as a regulatory switch. However, the comprehensive
structural perspective of AAA3 in dynein’s mechanochemical
cycle remains unclear. Here, we explored the allosteric transition
path of dynein involving AAA3 using a coarse-grained structure-based
model. ATP binding to the AAA1 domain creates a cascade of conformational
changes through the other domains of the ring, which leads to the
pre-power stroke formation. The linker domain, which is the mechanical
element of dynein, shifts from a straight to a bent conformation during
this process. In our present study, we observe that AAA3 gates the
allosteric communication from AAA1 to the microtubule binding domain
(MTBD) through AAA4 and AAA5. The MTBD is linked to the AAA+ ring
via a coiled-coil stalk and a buttress domain, which are extended
from AAA4 and AAA5, respectively. Further analysis also uncovers the
role of AAA3 in the linker movement. The free energy calculation shows
that the linker prefers the straight conformation when AAA3 remains
in the ATP-bound condition. As AAA3 restricts the motion of AAA4 and
AAA5, the linker/AAA5 interactions get stabilized, and the linker
cannot move to the pre-power stroke state that halts the complete
structural transition required for the mechanochemical cycle. Therefore,
we suggest that AAA3 governs dynein’s mechanochemical cycle
and motility by controlling the AAA4 and AAA5 domains that further
regulate the linker movement and the power stroke formation.

Introduction
Molecular motors are important biological
machines that drive many
key biological functions such as cell divisions, intracellular material
transports, and, more predominantly, the communications between cells
by walking on actins or microtubules.1−3 Among the different families
of the cytoskeletal motor, dynein is an ATPase-associated microtubule
(MT)-dependent motor protein that has no common ancestor with myosin
and kinesin.4−7 Cytoplasmic dyneins are essential for the transport of different
cargoes such as mRNA, organelles, vesicles, and viruses inside living
cells.8−12 It also acts as an anchor for the nuclei, Golgi, and centrosome
during mitosis to position them properly.13−16 However, because of its highly
complex structure, a comprehensive characterization of the mechanochemical
cycle and motility of cytoplasmic dynein is a challenging task. Recently,
researchers from both the theoretical and experimental expertise are
trying to explore this fascinating biological machine extensively.4,5,17−24

Different crystal structures and electron microscopy (EM)
studies
reveal that cytoplasmic dynein consists of two heavy chains that are
the crucial catalytic and mechanical site for motility.4,25−29 The core of each chain comprises a hexameric ring with six non-identical
AAA+ (AAA1 to AAA6) motile (Figure 1). Each AAA+ unit is subdivided into large (AAAL) and
small (AAAS) subdomains. The large subdomain contains five standard
parallel β sheets with H0-H4 helices, and the small subdomain
contains a five-helix bundle.26 A 10 nm
long, extended linker domain, which generates a mechanical force for
the displacement, spans the diameter of the hexameric ring and swings
between AAA2 and AAA5 depending on the nucleotide state of dynein.30,31 A 15 nm long coiled-coil stalk domain with a small globular MT binding
domain (MTBD) protrudes from AAA4, and a strut or buttress extended
from AAA5 makes contact with it.32 Movement
of dynein is associated with ATP hydrolysis in the AAA+ ring, which
drives a cascade of conformational changes in the ring.19,33,34 Due to the unique sequence and
structure of each AAA+ domain, it is a daunting task to assign the
role of each domain. Among the six AAA domains, AAA1 to AAA4 contains
nucleotide binding sites, and AAA5 and AAA6 domains do not contain
the walker A and walker B ATP binding and hydrolysis motifs.4,35 ATP hydrolysis at AAA1 is integrated with the kinetics of dynein
stepping. Dutta et al. investigated the mechanochemical pathway for
ATP hydrolysis at AAA1 with the linker movement.36 ATP binding to the AAA1 domain causes the formation of
the pre-power stroke state, which leads to the AAA1L/2L interface
closing, the MTBD detachment from the MT, and the linker movement
to the bent conformation. ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release engender
partial opening of the AAA1L/2L interface along with the attachment
of the MTBD with the MT and the linker shifting to its straight conformations.
The role of other ATP binding sites in the mechanochemical cycle is
not clearly known yet. Mutations that revoke ATP binding or hydrolysis
at AAA2 and AAA4 domains have a negligible effect on the velocity
of dynein; however, they affect processivity to some extent.22 On the other hand, ATPase mutations at AAA3
diminish dynein’s velocity and MT-dependent activity by an
order of magnitude.4,22,33 Although single ATP binding at AAA1 is sufficient for dynein’s
stepping along MTs, the conformational changes within the AAA-ring
domain that underlay the drastic impediment of dynein’s motility
due to blocking of ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 are still unknown. Bhabha
et al. reported X-ray and EM structures of yeast dynein with nonhydrolyzable
ATP analogue AMP-PNP.37 They suggest that
AAA3 acts as a switch by regulating the transmission of different
conformational changes between AAA1 and the linker. Both DeWitt et
al. and Nicholas et al. suggest that ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 elevates
the “MT-gate” to facilitate MT release and fast movement
of dynein.38,39 Thirumalai and his group investigated
the pathway of allosteric transition in dynein computationally.40 They observe that the interactions between the
linker and AAA2-insert loop is persistent when AAA3 is bound to ATP
and thus dynein is locked in a nonfunctional repressed state.40 Though all these studies shed some light on
the role of AAA3 in dynein’s mechanochemical cycle, a detailed
investigation is needed for the clear understanding of the allosteric
transition pathway of AAA3 in the mechanochemical cycle and power
stroke formation of dynein.

showing important
structural components. (A) AAA+ ring comprising six AAA+ domains,
AAA1 to AAA6 (shown in different colors), a linker domain spanning
over the ring, and a long stalk domain attached with a globular microtubule
binding domain (MTBD). (B) Post-power stroke state of dynein where
four nucleotide binding domains have AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP
analogue. The linker is in a straight conformation. (C) Pre-power
stroke state of dynein where AAA1 has an ATP hydrolysis transition
state analogue AOV, AAA2 has ATP, and AAA3 and AAA4 have ADP in their
binding sites. The linker has a bent conformation in the pre-power
stroke state.

Here, we developed a coarse-grained structure-based
model (SBM)41−43 to probe the gating mechanism of AAA3 using two end-state
crystal
structures. The SBM has been used extensively to study complex systems
like motor proteins earlier.36,44−49 A physical model can be built by using the structural information
present in the Protein Data Bank. One can perturb the model by incorporating
several interactions like ATP binding, ADP/Pi release, MT/actin binding,
etc., to study the structural changes due to these perturbations.
Other than native states, proteins acquire different conformations
to execute their functions. Therefore, stabilizing interactions that
are coming from other conformations should be incorporated to obtain
a better characterization of the functional landscape. The SBM allows
the mixing of the stabilizing interactions coming from other states.
In addition, the SBM permits the possibility of “cracking”,
which stabilizes the functional intermediates. Thence, the SBM can
capture different scales of motions from native to non-native states
relevant for different functions.

Results and Discussion
As our present study aims to
explore the control of allosteric
communication of dynein by its AAA3 domain during switching function,
we constructed our model to follow the responses of other domains
when AAA3 remains active and inactive during the transition. A multi-basin
SBM was developed by mixing the topologies (see the Computational Methods section for details) of two end-state
crystal structures: (i) the post-power stroke state where AAA3 along
with other nucleotide binding sites have a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue,
AMP-PNP (PDB ID: 4W8F), and the linker is in the straight conformation37 (Figure 1B) and (ii) the pre-power stroke state where AAA3 has ADP, AAA2 has
ATP, and AAA1 has a transition state analogue ADP–vanadium
complex (AOV) in its binding pockets and the linker is in the bent
conformation (Figure 1C) (PDB ID: 4RH7).27 From several experimental
studies, it has been found that during the post- to pre-power stroke
transition, the AAA1/2 cleft closes, the linker shifts from a straight
to a bent conformation, and the MTBD gets detach from the MT.30,31 In our present model, we have not considered the MTBD with MT explicitly;
however, we have built our simulation strategy in such a way that
we can draw a conclusion about the MTBD movement in an implicit way.
It is also important to mention that, in our study, ATP is not involved
explicitly; however, we can track the conformational changes implicitly.

Figure 2 shows us
the important conformational changes between the two end states. The
contact map was calculated at the smog@ctbp online server50−52 using a 0.6 nm default cutoff for Cα coarse-graining.
We observed that the contacts of the linker with AAA5 and AAA2-insert
loop (AAA2-IL), which are present in the post-power stroke state,
disappear in the pre-power stroke state and a new set of contacts
between AAA3/linker appear. We also find that new contacts are formed
at AAA1L/2L and AAA5L/6L interfaces in the pre-power stroke state
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 Differential
contact map of the post-power stroke and the pre-power
stroke states. Blue and red contact pairs indicate the unique contacts
of the pre-power stroke and the post-power stroke states, respectively.

To execute the post- to pre-power stroke transition
when AAA3 is
in the active and inactive states, we performed two types of multi-basin
SBM simulations: (i) type-I and (ii) type-II. In type-I, we prepare
a mixed topology with the contact pairs of both the pre- and post-power
stroke states, which allows a smooth transition from one state to
the other. We termed it as a nonrepressed simulation. In type-II,
the topology is generated in a similar way; however, AAA3 lacks the
information of the unique contact pairs of the pre-power stroke state,
which creates repression of AAA3 in the post-power stroke state or
ATP-bound state. However, other domains are free to move from one
state to the other. Due to the repression of AAA3 motion, we termed
it as a repressed-state simulation.

Allosteric Control of MTBD Movement
Previous studies
have established that ATP binding to the AAA1 domain leads to the
closing of the gap between AAA1 and AAA2 domains, which generate a
large number of conformational transitions that propagate through
the other domains and create AAA5 and AAA6 closing, the linker bending
along with the MTBD detachment.30,31 In our study, we investigated
the changes in different domains using distance, RMSD, and the fraction
of native contact (Q) as the order parameters. For
the type-I scenario, we have calculated the distances of AAA1/2, AAA5/6,
linker/AAA2, and linker/AAA5 over 50 trajectories to examine the cleft
closing and linker shifting during simulations (Figure 3). We have performed single-basin SBM simulations
that uniquely stabilize the post- or the pre-power stroke state. Figures S1 and S2 represent the distribution
of the distances between different domains in the pre- and post-power
stroke states, respectively. In each plot, we put a dotted line corresponding
to the peak of the distribution as obtained from two end-state single-basin
simulations. All the distances are calculated by taking one residue
from each domain (Figures S3 and S4). Please
see the Supporting Information for details. Figure 3A,B shows that the
AAA1/2 and AAA5/6 clefts close completely as the distances reach the
pre-power stroke state values. The linker also shifts from the straight
to the bent conformation as the distance between the N-terminal of
the linker and AAA2L decreases and that between the linker and AAA5L
increases to the values similar to the pre-power stroke state (Figure 3C,D). To confirm
the complete transition, we have calculated the distribution of Qpre (fraction of unique native contact pairs
of the pre-power stroke state formed during simulations) of each domain
where the values from 0 to 1 indicate the post- to pre-power stroke
transition (Figure 4). We first calculated the Qpre values
of each domain from single-basin simulations of the pre- and post-power
stroke states (Figure S5). For the linker
domain, we considered the unique contact pairs of the N-terminal linker
with AAA3 because the linker only makes contact with AAA3 in the pre-power
stroke state. From the distribution plot, we observed that, for the
post-power stroke state, the peak values of the distribution range
from 0.3 to 0.45 for AAA1 to AAA6 domains (Figure S5B), whereas the values for the pre-power stroke state are
between 0.9 and 1 (Figure S5A). For the
linker, the values are zero at the post-power stroke state and 1 at
the pre-power stroke state. (Figure S5C) For type-I simulations, Figure 4A shows that the peak values of all the distributions
are between 0.9 and 1.0, which signify a complete transition of each
domain to the pre-power stroke state. Figure 4C shows a peak value at 1 for the linker/AAA3
contact pairs that indicate the bent conformation in type-I. We have
also superimposed the structures obtained from type-I simulations
with the pre-power stroke state crystal structures. Figure S6 shows that AAA1/2 and AAA5/6 and the linker domains
superimposed completely. In the type-II scenario, as we know, AAA3
is in the switch off/inactive state, we examined all the major changes
over 50 trajectories again so that we can compare them with dynein’s
active condition. We noticed that the AAA1/2 cleft closes completely
in all of the trajectories to attain the pre-power stroke state conformations
(Figure 5A), whereas
the AAA5/6 cleft closes partially (Figure 5B) as the distance cannot reach the pre-power
stroke value and the linker remains in straight conformations (Figure 5C,D). There is a
small increase in linker/AAA2 distance from the post state value because
of the AAA1/2 cleft closing. We have calculated Qpre for the type-II scenario (Figure 4B) and found that AAA1 and AAA2 give peaks
close to 1.0 and the AAA6 peak value is close to 0.9, which indicates
a complete conformational change for these domains. For AAA3, the
peak value is 0.6, which is far from the pre-power stroke state due
to repression. The Qpre value of AAA3
in the post-power stroke state is 0.45. This small change (from 0.45
to 0.6) may be originated from the conformational changes of the other
domains that force AAA3 to make few contacts. The peak values for
AAA4 and AAA5 are 0.75 and 0.8, respectively, which suggest that AAA4
and AAA5 are unable to execute the full conformational changes to
the pre-power stroke state. Also, for the linker (Figure 4C), we found a distribution
with the peak value of 0.0 that implies that the linker remains straight
and cannot move to the bent conformation. Figure S7 represents superimposed structures between conformations
obtained from type-II simulations and the pre-power stroke state crystal
structure. We observed that AAA5/6 domains are not completely superimposed
and the linker remains in the straight conformation.

Figure 4 Fraction of unique native contact pairs of the pre-power
stroke
state (Qpre) of each domain in type-I
and type-II simulations. The peak values of the distributions close
to 1.0 indicate the pre-power stroke state. (A) In type-I simulations,
the peak values for AAA1 to AAA6 are between 0.9 and 1.0, which imply
a complete conformational change from the post- to the pre-power stroke
state. (B) For type-II, AAA1, AAA2, and AAA6 show peak values between
0.9 and 1.0. AAA4 and AAA5 show peak values much less than 1, which
indicate that AAA4 and AAA5 are unable to execute full conformational
changes to the pre-power stroke state. Due to the repression in the
AAA3 domain, it shows a peak value close to 0.6. (C) For the linker,
the unique contact pairs of linker/AAA3 were considered because the
linker only makes contact with AAA3 at the pre-power stroke state.
In type-I simulations, the linker shows a peak value at 1.0; however,
in type-II, the value is 0.0.

AAA1/2 cleft closes completely as the distance reaches the pre-power
stroke state value. (B) AAA5/6 cleft closes partially as the distance
cannot reach the pre-power stroke state value. (C) Linker/AAA2 distance
does not change significantly from the post-power stroke state values.
(D) Linker/AAA5 distance also remains at the post-power stroke state
values. The dotted line in each plot indicates the values of the distances
in the pre- and post-power stroke states.

We calculated the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
of each domain
(AAA1 to AAA6) from its initial position in both type-I and type-II
simulations (Figure 6). The distribution plots of RMSD (Figure 6) show that the AAA4 and AAA5 have lesser
RMSD values in type-II simulation as compared to type-I (Figure 6D,E), which indicates
minimal structural changes of AAA4 and AAA5 from its post-power stroke
conformation in type-II. AAA3 is repressed in type-II simulation,
so AAA3 has very little change in RMSD (Figure 6C). For the other three domains, AAA1, AAA2,
and AAA6, complete structural changes have occurred in both type-I
and type-II as evident from Figure 6A,B,F, respectively.

simulations. RMSD was calculated w.r.t. the crystal structure of the
post-power stroke state of each domain. (A–F) AAA1 to AAA6
domains. Pink and blue colors indicate type-I and type-II, respectively.
Note that AAA4 and AAA5 have lesser RMSD values in type-II as compared
to type-I simulations, which imply minimal structural changes from
their initial conformations. For AAA3, a little change in the RMSD
value in type-II is obvious as AAA3 motion is repressed.

If we refer to the structure of dynein in Figure 1A, we can observe
that a small globular MTBD
domain is connected with the ATPase ring via a long coiled-coil stalk
and a small buttress region that are extended forms of AAA4 and AAA5,
respectively. The AAA3 domain is directly connected to AAA4 and allosterically
to AAA5 via AAA4. So, there is a high possibility that any repression
in AAA3 motion can affect AAA4 and AAA5 either directly or indirectly.
When ATP binds to the AAA1 domain, the gap between AAA1 and AAA2 closes,
which simultaneously creates a cascade of domain motions that propagates
through the ring when AAA3 is in the ADP-bound state or active state
and ultimately leads to the linker shifting and the MTBD movement.
However, when AAA3 is in the ATP-bound state or inactive state, the
propagation of domain motion through the ring is inhibited, and AAA4
and AAA5 domains cannot execute its full conformational change to
create a proper mechanical force for the MT detachment. From our observation,
it could be inferred that the inhibition of the complete motion of
AAA4 and AAA5 domains indirectly favors the MT attached state of the
MTBD as both the coiled-coil regions are unable to pull the MTBD for
the detachment. Thus, AAA3 repression inhibits MTBD detachment and
slows down dynein movement.

Control on the Linker Movement
The linker is an important
element that generates force for the movement. We investigated the
effect on the linker movement due to the AAA3 domain repression. From Figure 5C, we observed that
the linker remains in the straight conformation in type-II simulations.
However, to explore the thermodynamic pictures of different linker
conformations, we calculated the free energy profile using an umbrella
sampling technique (see Computational Methods for details) implemented in GROMACS, and the distance between the
N-terminal linker and AAA2 was taken as an order parameter (Figure S4A,B). In type-I, we observed that the
bent conformation of the linker is stabilized more than the straight
one. However, in type-II, a larger stabilization of the straight conformation
along with a high energy barrier going from the straight to the bent
conformations of the linker makes the straight conformations of the
linker much more favorable than the bent conformations on AAA3 repression
(Figure 7).

Figure 7 Free energy
profiles of the linker in different conformations in
both type-I and type-II scenarios. Here, the N-terminal linker/AAA2
distance is taken as an order parameter. A high linker/AAA2 distance
indicates that the linker is in the straight conformation, and the
low value represents the bent conformation of the linker. In type-I,
the bent conformation is more favorable than the straight one. Note
that, in the type-II scenario, the straight conformation is much more
stabilized compared to the bent state.

We searched for the reason why the linker favors
the straight conformation
in the repressed state. Recent studies of Goldtzvik et al. have shown
that the AAA2 insert loop (AAA2-IL) has an important role in stabilizing
the linker in the straight conformation as the interaction between
AAA2-IL and the linker prevents the linker from bending.40 However, from contact map analysis (Figure 2), we understand
that the linker makes contact with AAA5 along with AAA2-IL in its
straight conformations. Thirumalai and his group have elucidated the
underlying mechanism using a coarse-grained self-organized polymer
model.40 They found that the ATP-bound
state of AAA3 stabilizes the linker/AAA2-IL interactions that prevent
the linker bending. However, what happens to the linker/AAA5 interactions
or how important those interactions are for the regulation of switching
function is not very clear from this study. In our present study,
we have focused on both the linker/AAA5 and linker/AAA2-IL interactions
to get a clear idea about the allosteric transition path. In the post-power
stroke state, the linker/AAA2-IL distance is around 0.7 nm (Figure S2E), and the linker/AAA5 distance is
around 2.2 nm (Figure S2D). In our type-I
simulations, we found that the distance between linker/AAA2-IL increases
from 0.7 to 2.0 nm initially due to the closing of the AAA1/2 cleft.
The distance further increases to 3.5 nm, which is the pre-power stroke
state value with the linker bending (Figure 8A). In type-II simulation, the AAA2-IL/linker
distance increases from the post-power stroke state value to 2.0 nm
due to the AAA1/2 cleft closing (Figure 8B). We have already seen that the linker/AAA5
distance does not change significantly and stays in the post-power
stroke state distance in type-II (Figure 5D). This observation suggests that the AAA3
repressed state is unable to break the linker/AAA5 interactions. We
can connect this fact with our previous observation that the linker/AAA5
contacts become stabilized because AAA5 is unable to complete its
full conformational change. Some experimental groups also proposed
that the rearrangement of AAA4 and AAA5 are needed for the dislodging
of the linker.37,53 Our present observations are
in good agreement with the experimental work by Nicholas et al.39 They investigated the effect of dynein-MT attachment
in the presence of tension depending on different nucleotide states
of AAA1 and AAA3 using optical tweezers. They pointed out a crucial
role of the linker in the gating mechanism of dynein via AAA3. They
observed that, if tension is absent or applied via the C-terminus
of dynein, ATP at AAA1 facilitates MT release only if AAA3 is in the
post-hydrolysis state. Instead, when tension is applied through the
linker, ATP binding to AAA3 is sufficient to lift the regulatory gate.
To further substantiate our observations, we have mutated the interactions
between the linker and AAA2-IL by providing those particular contact
pairs a repulsive potential in the repressed state. We observed that
the linker/AAA5 interactions do not break due to the mutations of
linker/AAA2-IL interactions and the linker prefers the straight conformation
(Figure S8A,B), which agrees with our previous
suggestion that a AAA5 conformational change is crucial.

Figure 8 Values of linker/AAA2-IL
distances in type-I and type-II scenarios.
(A) In type-I simulations, the linker/AAA2-IL distance increases initially
from 0.7 nm (the post-power stroke value) to 2 nm, and it increases
further to 3.5 nm (the pre-power stroke state) with the linker bending.
(B) Linker/AAA2-IL distance increases from 0.7 to 2 nm; however, it
cannot reach the pre-power stroke state value in type-II.

Next, we tried to find out what happens if we mutate
the interactions
between AAA5 and the linker. In a similar way, we mutated the contact
pairs between the linker and AAA5 in type-II simulations. From Figure 9B, we observed that
the linker/AAA5 distance increases, which indicates the destabilization
of the straight conformations of the linker in type-II. Next, we observed
that the linker gradually bends to the pre-power stroke state as the
distance between linker/AAA2 decreases (Figure 9A). To make sure about the conclusion, we
have calculated Qpre of the linker and
found that the peak arises at 0.85 (Figure 9C), which signifies the linker bending. However,
15% linker/AAA3 contacts cannot form properly due to AAA3 repression. Figure 9D shows a representative
structure where the linker bends after linker/AAA5 interactions have
been mutated. From this observation, we suggest that AAA3 repression
stabilizes linker/AAA5 interactions, which halt the linker movement;
however, after removing the interactions, the linker moves to the
bent state. The experimental work by Nicholas et al.39 also showed that when tension was applied through the linker,
MT-gate lifted in the presence of ATP at AAA3. To investigate the
conformational change of AAA4 and AAA5 due to linker/AAA5 mutations,
we have calculated Qpre for AAA4 and AAA5.
From Figure S9, we noticed that AAA4 and
AAA5 showed peak values much less than type-I simulations. From these
observations, we understand that the ATP-bound AAA3 repressed the
motion of AAA4 and AAA5 domains so that they cannot execute their
full conformational change to the pre-power stroke state, and as a
result of that, the linker favors the straight conformation because
the linker/AAA5 interactions get stabilized. As we understand that
the conformational change of AAA4 and AAA5 is very crucial for the
linker movement, we forcefully change the AAA4 and AAA5 domains to
the pre-power stroke state (see Computational Methods for details) in the type-II scenario to examine what happens to
the linker. From Figure S10A,B, we infer that the linker completely
bends to the pre-power stroke state as the linker/AAA2 distance decreases
and the linker/AAA5 distance increases. The Qpre value for the linker is also close to 1.0 (Figure S10C). We performed another type of simulation
where the AAA2 domain was repressed (type-III) to show that the effects
we were getting were not potential artefacts of our model and were
unique to the AAA3 domain only. From Figure S11, we notice that the AAA1/2 and AAA5/6 clefts close completely and
the linker shifts from the straight to the bent conformation after
AAA2 repression. Figure S11D shows that
peak values of Qpre of each domain are
close to 1.0 except that of AAA2, which implies a complete conformational
change of other domains to the pre-power stroke state.

have been mutated in the type-II scenario. (A, B) Plots showing that
both the linker/AAA2 and linker/AAA5 distances increase initially;
however, after some time, the linker/AAA2 distances decrease to the
pre-power stroke values, which indicate linker bending. (C) Qpre value for the linker shows a peak at 0.85,
which signifies the linker bending. Because of the AAA3 repression,
the linker cannot make full contact with AAA3. (D) Structural representation
showing that the linker completely bends after mutations.

The entire observations suggest that the ATP-bound
AAA3 gates dynein’s
mechanochemical cycle by directly governing the AAA4 and AAA5 motions,
which are important for the power stroke formation and the linker
movement. The AAA3 repressed state resists the allosteric communication
from AAA1 to AAA4 and AAA5 that hampers the full conformational change
of these two domains. As a consequence, MTBD detachment from the MT
through conformational changes within the coiled-coil stalk and the
buttress is prevented, and the linker/AAA5 interactions get stabilized
to preserve the straight conformation of the linker. In support of
this conclusion, Rao et al.54 recently
found from their experimental work that MT detachment requires dissociation
of the linker from AAA5 and that the docking of the linker to AAA5
in the straight conformation is required for the strong MT binding
registration of the stalk coiled coil. They demonstrated that the
buttress is very important for dynein motility. When they truncated
the buttress to prevent stalk–buttress interactions, they observed
that the MT binding affinity was reduced significantly and that the
tension-induced transition from weak to strong MT binding was prevented.
The linker controls conformational changes of the buttress through
the docking and undocking to and from AAA5 that control the strong
and weak MT binding states of the motor. They proposed that the linker/AAA5
interactions induce conformational changes within the buttress that
result in the sliding of the stalk helices into the α or γ
registries to induce increased MT binding and that preventing the
detachment of the linker from AAA5 inhibits the transition into the
weak MT binding β registry. This experimental work supports
the importance of linker/AAA5 interactions in the AAA3-mediated gating
functions.

Conclusions
In our present study, we used a structure-based
model to gain insight
into how AAA3 motion governs other different domain motions, which
are important for allosteric communication during power stroke formations.
We have generated two models: in one case, we allowed all the domains
to move freely from the post-power stroke (i.e., AMP-PNP/ATP-bound
state) to the pre-power stroke state (i.e., ADP at AAA3), and in another
model, we repressed AAA3 motion in the ATP-bound conformation intentionally
where the topology lacks the information of the pre-power stroke state
of AAA3; however, other domains are free to move. Previously, Thirumalai
and his group investigated the molecular mechanism behind this AAA3
regulatory switching function.40 Their
computational study using a self-organized polymer model proposed
that the ATP binding to the AAA3 stabilizes linker/AAA2-IL interactions
that prevent linker bending. We already know that the linker makes
contact with AAA5 along with AAA2-IL in the straight conformation.
However, the importance of linker/AAA5 interactions was not very clear
from their study. Many experimental works have already shown that
the linker/AAA5 interactions are crucial for the maintenance of the
straight conformation of the linker.39,54 Rao et al.54 demonstrated that the impairment of functional
linker/AAA5 interactions results in the weak MT binding β registry,
suggesting that linker/AAA5 interactions are required for the tension-induced
and strong MT binding α registry. In our present work, we focused
on both the linker/AAA5 and linker/AAA2-IL interactions to find out
the underlying mechanism. We noticed that the conformational change
in the AAA3 domain, going from the ATP- to ADP-bound conformation,
triggers AAA4 and AAA5 domains’ motions, which eventually generate
a proper force to pull the MTBD from the MT through the stalk and
buttress. However, when ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 is hampered indirectly
by inhibiting its conformational change, AAA4 and AAA5 cannot move
to the pre-power stroke state completely, and it indirectly restricts
the stalk domain movement, which in turn leads to the high affinity
of the MTBD with the MT and slows down dynein motility. Our present
work is directly supported by the recent works of Rao et al.54 and Nicholas et al.39 Both the experimental studies suggest the importance of linker/AAA5
interactions in stalk-helix sliding and MT detachment. When the linker
is docked to the AAA5, the buttress cannot undergo the necessary conformational
change to induce the weak MT binding β registry to cause MT
release. Therefore, the linker must undock from AAA5 to facilitate
rear head detachment to support rapid forward movement. In support
of this conclusion, Rao et al.54 have also
demonstrated that a dynein motor with the stalk helices cross-linked
into the strong MT binding α registry moves at a significantly
reduced speed. Again, when they applied tension through the linker,
they found that ATP binding to AAA3 is sufficient to promote MT release.

Bhabha et al. suggested that the linker, which is a mechanical
element, is also important for the ATPase activity of dynein.37 From their cryo-EM data, they propose that the
unbinding of the linker from AAA5 and bending promote ATP hydrolysis
at AAA1. The N-terminal linker at the AAA3 position influences the
conformation of the R finger at AAA2 in a proper catalytic component,
which is important for ATP hydrolysis at AAA1.4,37 Here,
we observed that the repressed state of dynein prevents unbinding
of the linker from AAA5 (Figure 5C) and favors the straight conformation, which is also
suggested by the free energy calculations (Figure 7). As AAA1 is the primary ATPase site, each
ATP hydrolysis at AAA1 triggers dynein’s single step. The linker
in the straight conformation basically inhibits the ATP hydrolysis
at AAA1, which causes the retardation of ATPase activity of dynein.
Our study suggests how AAA3 acts as a switching motif in the mechanochemical
cycle of dynein (Figure 10). We conclude that AAA3 gates the mechanochemical cycle of
dynein with the assistance of AAA4 and AAA5 that directly controls
the power stroke formation and the linker movement.

Figure 10 Model showing that ATP
hydrolysis at AAA3 regulates the activity
of dynein. From no nucleotide state, AAA1 and AAA3 bind ATP. The ATP-bound
AAA3 resists the propagation of conformational transition from AAA1
to AAA5. Thus, the mechanochemical cycle cannot proceed further. However,
after ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 dynein gains its activity that leads
to the allosteric communication of ATP-induced AAA1 through the other
domains like AAA4 and AAA5, thereby facilitating the linker movement
and MT release.

Computational Methods
We used the Cα coarse-grained
model to reduce the structural
complexity and long time scale problem for this large molecular machine.
We took two crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB): (i)
yeast dynein in the post-power stroke state where AAA1 to AAA4 are
bound to ATP analogues, AMPPNP (PDB ID: 4W8F)37 and (ii)
the pre-power stroke state of human dynein where AAA1, AAA2, and AAA3
are bound to AOV, ATP, and ADP, respectively (PDB ID: 4RH7).27 As we have two structures from two different species, their
sequences are different. In order to develop both the structure from
the same sequences, we modeled our pre-power stroke structure from
the SWISS-MODEL server55 by taking the
FASTA sequence of a yeast dynein and human dynein as a structural
template. Total residues in both the structures are 2483, including
linker, AAA1, AAA2, AAA3, AAA4 (with a small extended part of coiled
coil), AAA5 (with a small extended part of buttress), and AAA6 domains.

Building of a Multi-Basin Structure-Based Model
Cα
coarse-grained models were constructed, and topology files were generated
for the post- and pre-power stroke structures using the SMOG@ctbp50−52 online server. We developed a multi-basin structure-based model
by mixing the topologies from both the states. Let us consider that
the native contact pairs present in the post- and pre-power stroke
states are Mo and Mc, respectively. The native contact pairs are calculated directly
from two crystal structures with the same sequences using SMOG@ctbp
server taking 0.6 nm as a cutoff distance. Some contact-pairs are
identical in both the post- and pre-power stroke states, and they
are called common or shared contact pairs ((Mshared = Mo ∩ Mc). Some contacts are unique to a particular state; they
are MoUnique for the post-power state and McUnique for the pre-power
state. For the post- to pre-power stroke transition, we have generated
a mixed topology file incorporating the common contact pairs and the
unique contact pairs from both the states. The Hamiltonian for multi-basin
SBM is  where HB and HNB represent the local bonded and nonbonded
components, respectively, and superscript O and C represent the open/post-power
state and the closed/pre-power state, respectively. The general form
of the local bonded Hamiltonian is  

The first term ri, i + 1 is
the distance between two consecutive residues i and i+1, and it is harmonically constrained with respect to
its native distance ri, i + 10 by a spring constant Kr, where Kr = 200 kJ mol–1 Å–2. The second term θi represents the angle between residues of i, i+1, and i+2 and is
constrained by a harmonic spring constant Kθ, where Kθ = 40 kJ mol–1 rad–2, and it is constrained with respect to its
native value θi0. The dihedral angle
potential is constituted by the third term, which delineates the rotation
of the backbone involving successive residues from i to i+3, where Kφ(1) = 2Kφ(3) and Kφ(1) = 1 kJ mol–1.

The general form of the nonbonded Hamiltonian HNBO(unique), HNBC(unique), and HNB(shared) is represented
by  

HNBO(unique) and HNBC(unique)
refer to the unique contact
pairs of the post- and pre-power stroke states, respectively. HNB(shared) represents the common pairs present
in both the states. If i and j residues
are in contact, then Δij =
1; otherwise, Δij = 0. A repulsive potential is implied to the non-native
pairs (Δij = 0). ε and εr was set to 1.0 kJ mol–1.

All simulations were performed using the GROMACS
MD engine. For
type-I simulations, the mixed topology includes the common contact
pairs along with the unique contact pairs of both the post-power stroke
and pre-power stroke states. We start our simulation from the post-power
state, and the system gradually visits the pre-power state through
different intermediates. For type-II, the mixed topology was constructed
including the common contact pairs of both the states, the unique
contact pairs of the post-power stroke, and the unique contact pairs
of the pre-power stroke state for each domain excluding the intradomain
contacts of AAA3; however, the contacts of AAA3 with other domains
remain intact. For mutation purposes, we considered a repulsive potential
for a particular domain–domain contact pair where Δij = 0. When AAA4 and
AAA5 domains are forced to change to the pre-power stroke state, we
took ε = 1.5 kJ mol–1 for the unique contact
pairs of the pre-power stroke state of AAA4 and AAA5.

SBM Simulations
Both the initial structures were relaxed
in the structure-based Hamiltonian, and to collect different equilibrium
ensembles, we performed Langevin dynamics at 90 K (reduced temperature
where T* = 0.75) and at low friction limit to improve
sampling. The equation of motion for Langevin dynamics is  where ζ represents the friction coefficient,
–∂r⃗H({r⃗i}) is the conformational force, and Γ⃗i(t) is the random force that
satisfies  where the integration time step is 0.0005τL, where . Here, m is the mass of
the Cα atom, σ is the van der Waals radius of Cα,
and ϵ is the solvent-mediated interactions. We performed 50
simulations (a particular subset of each time vs distance plot is
shown in Figures S12 and S13) in each case where each simulation lasts
for 109 steps.

Free Energy Calculations
For the free energy calculations
(Figure 7), we used
an umbrella sampling technique implemented in GROMACS. The distance
between the N-terminal linker and AAA2 was considered as an order
parameter to explore the stability of the linker conformations in
the nonrepressed and AAA3-repressed conditions. In each case, we considered
46 windows where the distance varies from 7.8 to 3.1 nm. In each window,
a 1000 kJ/mol/nm2 biased force was applied to maintain
the particular distance, and equilibration and production runs were
performed for 107 and 108 steps, respectively.
From the histogram of distances, obtained from each window, we performed
the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM)56 to extract the free energy profile.
