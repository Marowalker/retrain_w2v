Identifying
research gaps and generating research questions are
often a first step in developing ideas for writing a research paper
or grant proposal. The concept of substance-based bibliometrics uses
the counts of substances in the scientific literature to better understand,
assess, and clarify the state and impact of information in the chemical
sciences. Connecting substances indexed to specific bioactivity or
target indicators can lead to assessing the biochemical, biological,
and medicinal relevance of substances as well as developing ideas
for expanding drug design and discovery through identifying and modifying
the structural features of molecules. This study uses Chemical
Abstracts through the SciFinder database to count for the
occurrence of substances in the scientific literature. The study sets
out search strategies for discovering potential research gaps and
new ideas through visualization of chemical structures with known
bioactivity and target indicators. The author recommends that subject
librarians integrate research gap training in their bibliographic
instruction classes, particularly to upper-level undergraduate and
graduate chemistry students.

1 Introduction
A research gap is a question or a problem in a subject field that
has been answered incompletely or insufficiently or that has not been
answered at all. Research gap spotting and generating research questions
are often a first key step to identifying and developing ideas for
writing a research grant proposal or paper. The initial research questions
scientists often ask include how, who, what, which, and why: How far
back does the literature extend on a scientific topic, element, substance,
or reaction? Who are the leading scientists working in a certain research
field? What are the potential applications for specific chemical structures?
Which substances show bioactivity? Which structural features are crucial
for specific bioactivity or target affinity? Which reactions do not
work? Why do certain functional groups or elemental species affect
bioactivity? Many science degree programs require students to write
and defend a research proposal; however, the process for discovering
gaps in the literature seldom receives any formal training. As a result,
this creates an outreach opportunity for science librarians to become
more involved with researchers and students through communication
modes such as bibliographic instruction and online guides.

1.1 Research Gaps: Literature Orientated
Searching the
literature through different document types is always
a good starting point for finding information about a research topic
and its current state. To this regard, although many journals are
dedicated to publishing review papers solely, high profile journals
generally answer and solve a problem. Performing a literature review
is often the first step to finding all literature and information
about a research topic. Browsing through review papers is one approach
for an overview, perspective, and understanding of a research topic
as well as finding leading researchers in a specific field.1 It is also important to continuously analyze
recent review papers to keep abreast on the current state of a research
area. Systematic reviews are types of literature reviews containing
many research studies that dwell deep into the literature with an
objective to analyze the trends and changes in a field of study.2,3 When conducting a systematic review, there are often protocols involved
in deciding what information is included and not included as well
as more evaluative statements made about the studies. In more traditional
review articles, the tone is more neutral and often there is no indication
of how the articles referenced were chosen.

Searching peer-reviewed
articles for information on future research (i.e., occasionally found
in the conclusion section or under a separate heading like “Future
Work”) offers another approach to identifying gaps in the literature.
The research methodology found in articles may also spark new ideas
for alternative approaches to a problem. The funding or acknowledgment
section can provide information about the grant source for the research
and could be an indicator where to submit similar research ideas.
Searching through dissertations and browsing laboratory notebooks
can provide more information on the progress of research. Various
reports such as content analysis reports, citation analysis reports,
and meta-analysis reports occasionally contain information on ideas
for further research studies.

1.2 Research
Gaps: Researcher Orientated
Communicating with experts in
a field is another approach in understanding
the state of a research area. Attending subject-specific conferences
conducted by experts in a research field provides an opportunity to
network and ask questions about extending research and debating ideas
for future studies. In particular, conferences offer opportunities
for dialogue at seminars, workshops, panel discussions, oral presentations,
poster sessions, and luncheons as well as various informal gatherings.
Visiting websites of leading researchers can provide ongoing information
about their research and the challenges ahead. Connecting and corresponding
with researchers through email, social media, or face-to-face are
one direct approach for input about a research idea. Communication
with the dissertation author may provide more direct insight into
the state of the research in the laboratory. On the other hand, some
scientists may be reluctant to discuss their ideas from being scooped
with their research. Moreover, because of the publish or perish nature
in academia, some researchers feel it is best to publish selected
results in small amounts or at times when they feel they have fully
researched the subject area. Sometimes, it is a matter of just communicating
at the right time and right place.

1.3 Research
Gaps: Field Orientated
Identifying
and analyzing the state of a research topic or field through online
tools can provide guidance and direction on the progress of research
and development. General online resources, such as Web of Science,
Scopus, Google Scholar, Essential Science Indicators, and Google Trends,
and subject-specific resources, such as SciFinder, Reaxys, PubChem,
PubMed, among many others, provide access to finding information about
related or most cited documents, and in many cases, the popularity
in a research field. Bibliometrics through collecting, counting, and
analyzing publication and citation information can further be used
to address trends in the literature. The use of different search strategies
with databases can provide past and present information on the state
of research about a scientific topic as well as background data on
substances.4−6

Schummer (1997) used Chemical Abstracts, Beilstein, Gmelin, and other chemical handbooks to show an essentially
exponential quantitative growth of substances between the years 1800
and 2000 with significant deviations stemming from world wars and
a “catching up phenomena” during postwar periods.7 Schummer (1997) also pointed out that “there
is still no saturation discernible after 200 years of exponential
growth of substances.”8

Barth
and Marx (2012, 2013) have introduced the idea of compound-based
bibliometrics by searching for compounds containing rare-earth elements
in Chemical Abstracts and linking to their corresponding
publications.9,10 They stated that “the
method can be applied to analyze large amounts of compounds in combination
with the corresponding chemical concepts, to identify gaps in research,
and hence open the door to new research in well-described compound-based
areas.”10 It was concluded that
“the compound-based bibliometric concept can easily be extended
to organic chemistry by searching molecular substructures rather than
element combinations, or to biochemistry by searching protein or nucleic
sequences.”10

With the emergence
of the internet and chemical databases such
as SciFinder, Reaxys, ChEMBL, and PubChem, it has now become possible
to quickly visualize and compare the structural makeup of property-specific
substances and brainstorm ideas for continued research work.11 To this regard, SciFinder is arguably the most
comprehensive database covering chemical literature (Table 1).12−18 SciFinder further allows for substance searching within the chemical
literature.19 SciFinder has assigned physical
property data as well as bioactivity and target indicators to substances
through the reported literature (Table 2).20−22 Bioactivity indicators are a set of controlled vocabulary
used to report a particular biological activity in the literature
(e.g., anti-inflammatory agents, antitumor agents, cardiovascular
agents, enzyme inhibitors, immune agents, nervous system agents, reproductive
control agents, wound healing promotors).16,20 Target indicators are a set of controlled vocabulary used to report
particular biological targets in the literature (e.g., albuminoids,
apoptosis-regulating proteins, blood-coagulation factors, cytokines,
enzymes, globulins, glycoproteins, protease inhibitors, RNA formation
factors).16,20 These indicators are reminiscent of National
Therapeutic Indicators. A complete list of these indicators is however
not publicly available.23 The presence
or absence of bioactivity and target indicators can be used to identify
potential areas for further research and drug design. By comparing
the number of substances to an associated bioactivity or target indicator,
scientists can analyze and evaluate relevant structural features to
extend and develop research ideas. Potential research gaps and new
ideas can be singled out through visual examinations and assessments
of chemical structures with known bioactivity and target indicators.

This study uses titanocene dichloride, (η5-C5H5)2TiCl2 (CAS registry number:
1271-19-8), as a model molecule to identify and compare substances
that show antitumor activity using different search strategies with
the SciFinder database. The substance searches conducted in the study
include the following:Exact
structure, substructure, and similarity (a score
of 90 as a cutoff point) search for titanocene dichloride (Table 3 and Figure 1). The search is used to compare
and analyze biological activity information obtained from the three
different search types.

Similarity searches
on titanocene dichloride through
addition and replacement of ligands around the central titanium metal
(Table 4). The search
uses the idea of ligand substitution to analyze and evaluate substances
for biological activity.

Substructure
searches on titanocene dichloride through
substitution of functional groups on the Cp ligand (Table 5). The search uses the idea
of ligand modification to analyze and evaluate substances for biological
activity.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Substance Counts by Search Type
According
to Miller (2002), “an exact-match search can be thought of
as looking up a complete word in a dictionary. A substructure search
is analogous to a wild-carded text search, and a similarity search
resembles a “sound-like” search.”24 An exact structure search retrieves the substance
exactly as drawn and component systems. A substructure finds the exact
substance and the searched structure embedded within other substances.
A similarity search finds similar structures based on similarity scores
from a highest (most similar) to lowest (least similar) value. In
SciFinder, a similarity search uses a Tanimoto algorithm to retrieve
all structures based on similarity.25,26 The algorithm
uses statistical analysis to compare the structure drawn to all other
structures in the database. The similarity scores have a scale range
of 0–100 and are based on CAS structure descriptors such as
element composition, atom count, ring count, atom sequence, bond sequence,
and degree of connectivity.26 A similarity
search could result in retrieving substances with functional groups
or bonding arrangements that may not be obvious to the researcher.
The most similar structures are identified as a higher score (e.g.,
similarity score of ≥99 contains the most similar structures).
According to SciFinder (2005), substances with a similarity score
above 60 will usually be displayed.26

Performing an exact structure search in SciFinder does not allow
for variations in atoms (e.g., generic groups or R-groups); however,
variable bonds are allowed (e.g., unspecified bonds). On the other
hand, similarity searches cannot be done with structures that contain
R-groups, variables, repeating groups, variable attachment, multiple
fragments, and stereo bonds.27,28 A substructure search
is generally performed when searching for specific structural or atom
requirements in a chemical structure, whereas a similarity search
is used for exploring similar substances with greater variation in
the literature.27,28

The results from an exact
structure search are redundant with both
the substructure and a similarity search because they form a subset
of each of the latter two searches. However, by separating the searches,
the results can be refined accordingly for focusing on the substance
structure (e.g., substances with the discrete structures or embedded
structures) as well as limit the number of substances in the set for
easier visualization, interpretation, and comparative analysis. A
similarity search also ensures finding substances within a component
system such as copolymers, mixtures, and salts even though it may
not be present as an exact form or contain a CAS registry number.
Performing an exact structure or similarity search separately yields
fewer substances that are structurally similar. Fewer substance counts
can facilitate easier and better visualization for comparing closely
related structures (e.g., viewing 9 or 37 substances is easier than
315 substances, Figure 1). Further, an exact structure search retrieves multicomponent substances,
where the searched molecule is present and discrete. This can lead
to identifying research gaps based on modifying substance components
rather than the searched substance.

The type of bioactivity
and target indicators found from an exact
structure, substructure, and similarity (score ≥90) search
using (η5-C5H5)2TiCl2 are shown in Table 3. It is evident from Table 3 that antitumor agents are the most common
type of bioactivity indicator from each search type. In addition,
the majority of different target indicators were identified from a
substructure search. Figure 1 shows the counts of substances identified as antitumor agents
for (η5-C5H5)2TiCl2 to each search type. An exact structure search for (η5-C5H5)2TiCl2 yielded
190 substances where the majority were multicomponent systems, whereas
others were labeled with 13C or D on the rings. From the
190 set of substances, two classes of bioactivity indicators were
identified with nine substances as antitumor agents (Table 3). One substance was the parent
compound, and eight substances were multicomponents in the form of
copolymers. A slight modification of the backbone of the organic fragment
of the polymer could inspire new research. Further, accessing articles
to these substances can provide synthesis information as well as the
funding sources to submit research proposals.

A substructure
search for (η5-C5H5)2TiCl2 yielded 3224 substances from
which were identified seven different bioactivity indicators (Table 3). A total of 315
substances were classified as antitumor agents (Figure 1). Retrieving references to each indicator
can be found by going directly to the substance “handbook format”
table of information by clicking on the “CAS number”
or via view “Substance Detail” (Figure 2). Information such as specific enzymes can
be located from this table (e.g., target indicators for titanocene
dichloride are enzymes to which is stated glutaminase with access
to 13 references). Using the variable function from the structure
editor, a substructure search conducted on (η5-C5H5)2TiX2 (where X = any halide),
yielded 5728 substances from which identified a slight increase of
349 substances as antitumor agents (i.e., one of seven different bioactivity
indicators).

Figure 2 Accessing bioactivity and target indicators from a substance
table
in SciFinder.

A similarity search (score
≥90) for (η5-C5H5)2TiCl2, yielded
711 substances from which were identified 37 substances as antitumor
agents and 3 substances as anti-infective agents (Table 3). By identifying the bioactivity
and target type for each structure, drug discovery scientists can
obtain supportive evidence and guidance for further studies. According
to Garritano (2013), “it is also possible to identify substances
that do not have indexed bioactivity or target indicators though they
may be structurally similar to known compounds. These substances might
be chosen for further research or investigation as to whether they
would have similar, as yet undiscovered, biological activity or not.”21 Others have further stated that “these
bioactivity and target indicators guide drug discovery scientists
to new uses for known drugs, possible side effects, and the original
literature where pharmaceutical information was reported.”22

2.2 Substance Counts by Ligand
Addition and Replacement
A structural comparison for (η5-C5H5)2TiCl2 to
other compounds through a
similarity search (score ≥90) is shown in Table 4. The strategy in Table 4 was to deduce the assembly
of the Cp rings and chloro groups needed for bioactivity. This can
be performed by simply adding or replacing functional groups or stereochemistry
around the molecule, followed by analyzing for the number of substances
indexed to a specific type of bioactivity or target indicator. This
type of refining search strategy is much like a keyword search, where
adding or removing terms in a Boolean search allows to narrow or broaden
the resulting search to retrieve the most relevant hit set. This building
search process provides a strategy to identify a parent species with
a bioactivity or target indicator that holds the most promise for
further investigation. To this regard, the obvious choice for (η5-C5H5)2TiCl2 would
be to remove or add more Cp and chloro groups and deduce the best
combination of ligands around the titanium center for the highest
counts of substances with antitumor activity. From Table 4, it can be deduced that two
Cp rings and one or two chloro groups on titanium result in the highest
number of antitumor substances. This hints that modification of these
structural features could lead to other substances with potential
biological activity and sets out an opportunity for more synthetic
ideas. Likewise, the half-sandwiched species, CpTiCl3,
was found to have one substance identified as an antitumor activity.
Consequently, an opportunity for further research could be envisioned
through replacement or modification of the Cp rings and ancillary
ligands. This in turn could lead to improved antitumor activity.

A substructure or similarity search can be used to identify different
metals, in addition to isotope elements and multicomponent systems
such as counterions. Furthermore, trends from the periodic table (e.g.,
elements with the most similar properties are located in the same
group) can be used to identify other elements for replacement (i.e.,
Ti is in the same group as Zr and Hf). This can bring forth ideas
for extending the synthesis to other potential substance analogues
exhibiting bioactivity.

2.3 Substance Counts by Ligand
and Chemical Structure
Modification
Table 5 shows the results of substructure searches for analogues
of titanocene dichloride indexed as the antitumor activity. Strategies
and rationales for ligand substitution and modification can be considered
when determining how to approach a substance search. Optimizing drug
metabolism and pharmacokinetics can occur through solubility, stability,
side effects, steric hindrance (bulkiness) and dimension, electronic
effects (resonance and intrinsic inductive effects), and stereochemistry.29−31 Functional groups can have an electronic, solubility, and a steric
effect on the substance. To this extent, the cytotoxic activity of
substances may well be correlated with their structure.32 The unique properties of transition metals can
also affect the activity.33−35 As a result, various rationales
can be drawn when deciding how to modify a structure, such as the
influence of a specific group to help with water and lipid solubility
and prevent unwanted side effects; adding polar groups to increase
polarity yet decrease hydrophobicity; bulkiness and electronic effects
from functional groups to increase the chemical and metabolic stability
of a drug [e.g., changing the position of the functional group on
the phenyl ring (i.e., para, ortho, and meta positions) such as an
ortho group could act as a steric shield and hinder hydrolysis]; maintaining
an optimized ratio of ionized to unionized drug species by controlling
the pKa through functional groups; and
masking groups known for toxicity or side reactions. The strategy
of incorporating a group onto a Cp ring to increase bulkiness and
electronic effects could be used to enhance bioactivity or linking
two Cp rings to improve hydrolytic stability. Some researchers have
stated that incorporating polar electron-withdrawing groups on the
Cp ring could help with the solubility as well as improve antitumor
activity from increasing the Lewis acidity of the Ti(IV) center to
enhance binding to DNA.36,37 Sometimes, it is a
matter of trial and error to see which groups or structural modifications
result in the highest counts of substances with bioactivity. Moreover,
from the substance counts showing activity, a sense of structural
direction can emerge. This type of refining search strategy using
functional group modification can be envisioned like a truncation
or wild card search where slight modification of the search term brings
up the highest number and most relevant hits.

One strategy for
ligand modification in Table 5 was to add a group to the Cp ring that would affect solubility
and then alter the group slightly to see if the effect would increase
or decrease the number of substances with antitumor activity. This
effect was also examined by incorporating unreactive methoxy groups.
The counts of antitumor substances were further analyzed by introducing
chirality and linking two Cp rings. Replacing phenyl with a benzyl
group attached to one Cp increases the number of active substances
from zero to 74. Similarly, placing two benzyl groups on the same
Cp ring compared to one benzyl group on each Cp ring increases the
count of antitumor substances from zero to 62. A strategy to determine
the best structurally fit active substance in Table 5 is to calculate the gap count between the
total number of substances and the number of substances with activity
(i.e., so long as there are substance counts with activity). Generally,
the smaller the gap count, the more promise the active substance holds.
Hence, over 45 percent of all substances with the methoxy groups has
antitumor activity, and 60 percent of all substances from the ansa-bridged
ligand shows antitumor activity. Thus, through modification of the
structural features on the Cp ligand (e.g., ansa-bridged Cp ligand,
electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups, chirality), scientists
can deduce and design the structural makeup of substances that may
hold promise for potential or improved bioactivity.

2.4 Substance Set Refining by Property Values
SciFinder
allows to search and to refine by experimental and predicted
property information (Table 2). Substance sets can be refined by physical property value
from the refine menu and selecting a property value such as H donors,
H acceptors, molecular weight, and solubility, among other values
within a specified range. As shown in Figure 3, selecting “Property Value”
in SciFinder allows to plug-in a range for two experimental property
values as well as 21 different predicted property values. Selecting
“Property Availability,” followed by “Any Selected
Experimental Property” allows to retrieve any combination of
the 13 experimental property values without specifying a range. The
range for all substance properties (experimental and predicted) can
be specified from the “Property” search option in SciFinder;
however, this is not limited to the substance set, but all substances
within the database. Refining the substance sets by specific property
data can be an important factor for developing drugs such as the drug-likeness
of a substance outlined by Lipinski’s rule of five (i.e., no
more than 5 hydrogen donors, no more than 10 hydrogen acceptors, molecular
weight less than 500, and octanol–water partition coefficient
less than 5)38 or the rule of three for
fragment-based drug discovery (i.e., no more than 3 hydrogen donors,
no more than 3 hydrogen acceptors, molecular mass less than 300, and
octanol–water partition coefficient no more than 3).39

3 Applications
in Teaching
It is recommended that subject librarians integrate
research gap
training in their bibliographic instruction classes. This can be accomplished
when demonstrating a search for a substance using SciFinder in the
classroom, followed by analyzing the substance set by specific bioactivity
or target indicator. At this point in the class, the concept of the
research gap could be introduced by asking students for potential
ideas and reasons for modifying the structural features in the resulting
substance set to extend the research. That way, the research gap message
is short and sweet, allowing students to critically think. From
personal experiences, this type of approach has students engaged in
creative brainstorming and sharing of ideas.

Synthesizing a
new substance could involve something as simple
as introducing or removing a methyl group into the known substance.
Moreover, given that the experimental procedure is already available
for known substances, it could just be a matter of adding or changing
a simple group in the reactant that would result in a new substance.
Introducing the research gap is especially useful to chemistry students
who are required to write a research proposal as part of their degree
program or come up with a quick project idea for a synthetic organic
or inorganic laboratory class.

4 Future Work
Subscription-based
resources such as SciFinder are seamless, user-friendly,
and maintain high-quality control with the information content. These
features make it all the more suited to use with the novice student
researcher. However, not all information is available solely from
one resource. In addition, some resources contain data that are geared
toward a specific science discipline. To this regard, other subscription-based
resources such as the Reaxys Medicinal Chemistry40 database also contain millions of bioactivity data points
and thus worthy for future study. In addition, publicly accessible
resources such as PubChem41,42 and ChEMBL43 could be compared as they provide searching
capabilities to large volumes of substances and easy access to curated
and annotated data. Comparing substance-based bibliometrics between
commercially and publicly available resources would, therefore, be
useful for further study.44,45 Future work could also
explore the bioactivity and target indicators from the elements of
the periodic table (elemental-based bibliometrics)46 and reaction chemistry (reaction-based bibliometrics) for
applications to drug synthesis.

5 Conclusions
The concept of substance-based bibliometrics uses the counting
of elements or compounds rather than publications and citations in
the scientific literature to better understand, assess, and clarify
the state and impact of information in the chemical sciences. The
assignment of specific bioactivity and target indicators to millions
of substances in commercial and public databases provides an opportunity
to identify gaps in drug design and discovery. With the knowledge
that such information is right at our fingertips, it is hoped that
scientists will become inspired to utilize and apply these searching
tools and strategies to their research.

6 Methodology
The SciFinder database is a product produced by Chemical
Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical
Society (ACS). The coverage and content in SciFinder is shown in Table 1.12−18 The Chemical Abstracts Plus (CAplus) file of SciFinder
contains millions of chemistry and other science-related research
records. The registry numbers of substances are included in the records
in the Chemical Abstracts file of articles that employ
or describe those substances. Each substance in the CAS Registry file
is linked to available literature references, spectra, experimental
property data, commercial availability synthesis and reactions, CA
index names, and regularity information to the substance. CAS has
further assigned bioactivity and target indicators to substances for
assessing their biological characteristics (Table 2).20−22 Bioactivity and target indicators
are identified to substances in the CAS REGISTRY database through
documents in the CAplus database. These indicators are applied to
a substance’s record when at least one paper is indexed as
attributing a specific activity to that substance. All SciFinder searches
in this study were performed between July and September 2018.

Titanocene dichloride was used to compare the substance counts
from an exact structure, substructure, and similarity (score of 90
as cutoff point) search. To this regard, from the “Explore”
menu in SciFinder, the “Substance Identifier” option
query was selected. The name of the substance, titanocene dichloride,
was typed in and searched. Titanocene dichloride was moved to the
chemical editor by hovering over the chemical structure and selecting
“Click for more options” (double arrow), followed by
selecting “Explore by Structure” and “Chemical
Structure.” This copied
the substance into the chemical editor which in turn allowed it to
be further modified to other substances, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. It is also possible to draw the substances from scratch
in the chemical editor or draw it using chemical drawing software
such as ChemDraw and import it as a molfile. Starting from a name
or molecular formula search, followed by copying to the chemical editor
can sometimes be easier, particularly with drawing more complex groups
such as η3 or η5 ligands as well
as leading to fewer drawing errors.

By respectively selecting
exact structure, substructure, and similarity,
the database retrieved all relevant substances. The “Analyze
by” dropdown option from the “Analyze” menu allowed
to select different options such as “Bioactivity Indicators”
or “Target Indicators.” From the bioactivity indicator,
all substances classified as “Antitumor agents” were
selected. By clicking on the “Show More” option, followed
by “Apply,” the user can select multiple indicators
and retrieve the respective substances of interest for viewing.

A similarity search (score of 90 as cutoff point) for comparison
analysis was performed for “stable titanocene,” (C20H20Ti2), searched via “Molecular
Formula”, whereas titanocene monochloride, titanocene trichloride,
and titanium tetrachloride were searched via “Substance Identifier.”
A substructure search for comparison analysis was performed by modifying
titanocene dichloride in the structure editor and selecting the substructure
option. The Supporting Information provides
screenshots of the steps involved with searching SciFinder.
