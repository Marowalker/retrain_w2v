Solid
electrolytes with compositions of (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol %, 0 ≤ x ≤
100) were mechanochemically prepared from the 75Li2S·25P2S5 (mol %) glass and LiBH4 crystal.
The samples with x ≥ 43 have crystalline phases
and those with x ≤ 33 formed a glassy phase.
The crystalline phase was identified as argyrodite Li6PS5(BH4). The x = 50 sample formed
a crystalline phase and demonstrated a high lithium-ion conductivity
of 1.8 × 10–3 S cm–1 at 25
°C with an activation energy of 16 kJ·mol–1. The argyrodite-type crystal with a BH4– anion that occupies the halide site is a novel and promising solid
electrolyte.

1 Introduction
All-solid-state lithium-ion
batteries have attracted significant
attention as next-generation batteries.1 The performance of the all-solid-state batteries strongly depends
on the conductivities of the solid electrolytes.2 Recently, sulfide-based solid electrolytes have become
more widespread because they possess high conductivities (>10–3 S cm–1 at 25 °C)2−8 and good mechanical properties for the formation of effective interfaces
between solids.9,10 Adding lithium halides to glass
electrolytes is well-known to be effective in improving conductivity.
For example, LiI in addition to sulfide-based glasses resulted in
a high conductivity of 10–3 S cm–1 at 25 °C.3,11,12 Argyrodite Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, and I) also
displayed high conductivities of over 10–3 S cm–1 at 25 °C.13−16

Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) has
been reported to exhibit
high lithium-ion conductivity and high stability to reduction at high
temperatures.17,18 LiBH4 is also attractive
as an additive salt in the solid electrolyte. Previous investigations19−21 have revealed that the addition of LiBH4 to sulfide-based
glassy solid electrolytes by a mechanochemical process increases their
conductivities.20 The glasses were fabricated
with compositions ranging from x = 0 to 33 in (100
– x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol %). It
was discovered that crystals precipitated in samples with x ≥ 43.19,20 A similar crystalline
phase was also observed in the LiBH4–P2S5 system.21

In this
study, we mechanochemically prepared solid electrolytes
with crystalline phases with a composition of (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4. We determined that the
prepared crystal had an argyrodite phase and that the BH4– anion occupied the halide site of the argyrodite
structure. The solid electrolytes with the argyrodite-type phase exhibited
a high lithium-ion conductivity of 1.8 × 10–3 S cm–1 at 25 °C.

2 Methods
Solid electrolytes with compositions of (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol %, 43 ≤ x ≤ 100) were prepared via a mechanochemical process. In addition,
(100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol
%, x = 0 and 33) glasses were prepared by the same
process for comparison. Li2S (Idemitsu Kosan, 99.9%), P2S5 (Aldrich, 99%), and LiBH4 (Aldrich,
90%) were used as starting materials. First, a stoichiometrically
calculated mixture of Li2S and P2S was mechanically
milled in a 225 mL ZrO2 pot with 2500 ZrO2 balls
(4 mm in diameter) using a planetary ball mill (Fritsch, Pulverisette
5) at 213 rpm for 45 h. The resulting 75Li2S·25P2S5 glass was then mixed with a calculated amount
of LiBH4 crystals. Mechanical milling of this mixture was
performed in a 45 mL ZrO2 pot with 500 ZrO2 balls
(4 mm in diameter) using a planetary ball mill (Fritsch, Pulverisette
7) at 510 rpm for 15 h to form the (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 solid electrolytes. All processes were
performed under a dry Ar atmosphere. The compositions of the (100
– x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples are
given in Table 1. The
ratio of BH4– and PS43– was varied by integral ratios.

X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.1542 nm) were performed using a diffractometer (Rigaku,
Ultima IV). An air-sealing holder was used to prevent exposure of
the samples to air. Rietveld refinements were performed using RIETAN-FP.22 The XRD data were collected in the 2θ
range between 10° and 80° at a scan rate of 0.1°·min–1 and a step size of 0.02°. The structure was
refined starting from the published XRD data by Rayavarapu et al.15 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was
performed on the obtained samples sealed in an Al pan in a glovebox
using a thermal analyzer (Seiko Instruments Inc., DSC6200) at a scanning
rate of 10 °C min–1. Raman spectra were obtained
using a Raman spectrometer (HORIBA, LabRAM HR-800) with a 325 nm He–Cd
laser. To measure electrical conductivities, the samples were first
placed under 360 MPa pressure at room temperature to form pellets
10 mm in diameter and 1–1.5 mm in thickness. ac impedance measurements
were performed using an impedance analyzer (Solartron, 1260) in the
frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 8 MHz. The all-solid-state cells were
constructed in the same way as previously reported elsewhere except
that newly developed solid electrolytes were used.9

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
XRD patterns of the mechanochemically prepared (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples. The XRD patterns
for x = 0 and 33 display characteristic halo patterns;
it has been previously reported that the samples with x ≤ 33 have a glassy state.20 For
the samples with 43 ≤ x ≤ 82, unknown
diffraction peaks, which were not attributed to the starting materials
of Li2S, P2S5, or LiBH4, were observed in the XRD patterns. In the XRD pattern of the x = 82 sample, the peaks attributed to LiBH423 were also observed, suggesting that unreacted
LiBH4 was present in a small quantity in the x = 82 sample.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of as-milled (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol %, 0 ≤ x ≤
82)
solid electrolytes. The XRD pattern of LiBH4 from the data
of Soulié et al.23 is shown for
comparison.

The DSC curves of the
(100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples
and the LiBH4 crystal are shown
in Figure 2. Gas generations
were detected in Li2S–P2S5–LiI samples under 220 °C. For example, the weight loss
due to the gas generation was detected at 180 °C in the x = 50 sample by thermogravimetric analysis conducted before
the DSC measurements. Thus, the DSC measurements were conducted below
the gas generation temperature. The gas generation would be caused
by thermal decomposition of the samples. This suggests that this series
of materials can be prepared only by the low-temperature process.
An endothermic peak at 113 °C in the LiBH4 curve can
be attributable to a phase transition from orthorhombic to hexagonal,24 which is observed at 113 °C. A similar
endothermic peak is not observed for the (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples except for the x = 82 sample, which partially includes the LiBH4 crystal.
The DSC curves for the x = 43, 50, and 54 samples
exhibit broad exothermic peaks at approximately 60–160 °C.
The x = 0 sample has an exothermic peak at 213 °C,
which has been reported to arise from the crystallization of the glass.25 Thus, it is considered that the broad exothermic
profiles observed in the x = 43, 50, and 54 samples
are attributable to the crystallization and/or increase in the crystallinity.

of (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol
%, 0 ≤ x ≤ 100) solid
electrolytes and LiBH4 crystal.

Figure 3 shows
the
Raman spectra of the (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples and the LiBH4 crystal between
200 and 3000 cm–1. The band at 420 cm–1 can be attributed to the PS43– ions26 and is observed for samples containing LiBH4. Samples containing LiBH4 also display a broad
band at approximately 2330 cm–1. This band can be
attributed to BH4– ion vibrations. Vibration
of the internal BH4– ions results in
strong bands at 2275 and 2300 cm–1 for the orthorhombic
low-temperature phase and a broad band at approximately 2300 cm–1 for the hexagonal high-temperature phase.27 The bands observed in the spectra of the samples
with x ≤ 54 are similar to those observed
in the high-temperature phase. The band observed in the spectrum of
the samples with x = 82 is similar to that observed
in the low-temperature phase.27 The rotation
of the BH4– ions probably accelerates
in the high-temperature phase,28,29 where there is delocalization
of the negative charge on the BH4– ions.
The BH4– and Li+ ions have
weakened electrostatic interactions in the high-temperature LiBH4 phase and the x ≤ 54 samples prepared
in this study.

electrolytes and LiBH4 crystal.

The temperature dependence of the conductivities of the 50(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·50LiBH4 solid electrolyte (x = 50) and 75Li2S·25P2S5 glass (x = 0)
is shown in Figure 4. The LiBH4 crystal data reported by Matsuo et al.17 are also shown for comparison. In the temperature
range from 20 to 70 °C, the conductivities of the samples with x = 50 obey the Arrhenius law and the conduction activation
energy is determined to be 16 kJ mol–1. Although
higher conductivities are obtained above 70 °C, accurate values
are difficult to measure because of the extremely low resistance.
The crystalline sample with x = 50 exhibits a higher
conductivity (1.8 × 10–3 S cm–1) at 25 °C than those of the 75Li2S·25P2S5 glass samples (2.7 × 10–4 S cm–1) and the LiBH4 crystal high-temperature
phase (1.0 × 10–3 S cm–1 at
115°C17).

The influence of composition
on the conductivity at room temperature
and activation energies for the (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 solid electrolytes is shown in Figure 5. The experimental results
of the glassy electrolytes with x = 0, 11, and 3320 are also shown. In the glass-forming region,
the conductivity of the glasses increases and the activation energies
decrease with increasing LiBH4 content. The x = 50 crystalline sample displays higher conductivity and lower activation
energy than those of the other compositions, suggesting that the crystalline
phase exhibits high lithium-ion conductivity. The conductivity dramatically
decreased in the x = 54 and x =
82 samples. The conductivity of the x = 82 sample
was less than 10–6 S cm–1 at 25
°C. The reason of the decrease of the conductivity has not been
clarified yet. One possibility is that the highly resistive amorphous
materials as LiBH4 were formed at grain boundary of the
highly conducting argyrodite crystallites in the sample. The possibility
of decreasing the conductivities of crystalline phase with argyrodite
phase was also not denied at the present stage.

on conductivities and conduction activation
energies of (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (mol
%, 0 ≤ x ≤ 54) solid electrolytes.

To characterize the crystal structure,
samples with higher crystallinity
were prepared by heat treatment at 130 °C. Figure 6a shows the XRD patterns of the as-obtained
and heat-treated samples with an x = 50 composition.
The intensities of the diffraction peaks observed in the spectra of
the as-obtained sample increase with the heat treatment, indicating
that the exothermic peaks observed in Figure 2 can be attributed to crystallization. The
DSC results indicate that the x > 33 samples are
primarily composed of crystal and glass components. The pattern of
the newly formed crystal phase is similar to that of the argyrodite-type
crystal Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, and I),14,15 suggesting that the obtained crystalline phase is argyrodite-type.
The ionic radii of Cl– (0.168 nm) and Br– (0.195 nm) ions are similar to that of BH4– ions (0.205 nm).30 Thus, we presume that
the Li7–xPS6–x(BH4)x crystal
precipitates, where BH4– ions occupy
the sites of Cl– or Br– ions in
the Li7–xPS6–xXx crystal. The structural
model of the Li6PS5Cl crystal reported by Rayavarapue
et al.15 was used as a starting point for
the Rietveld refinement.

sample. The solid line represents the calculated intensities, and

the lines indicate the positions of the allowed Bragg refractions.
The curve at the bottom shows the difference between the observed
and calculated intensities on the same scale.

Figure 6b
shows
the Rietveld refinement pattern of the heated x =
50 sample. The refined structural parameters for Li6PS5(BH4) obtained from the Rietveld refinements are
summarized in Table 2. Peak indexing of the XRD data suggests that the new phase exhibits
argyrodite structure in the space group F4̅3m with a lattice parameter of 1.001(8) nm. The BH4– and S2– ions are disordered
over the 4a site (0 0 0) (67% BH4, 33%
S) and 4d site (3/4 3/4 3/4) (33% BH4,
67% S). It was previously reported that disorder in the S2–/X– (X = Cl, Br, and I) distribution promotes lithium-ion
mobility in argyrodite-type crystals.15 The large I– ions cannot be exchanged for S2– ions, and the resulting Li6PS5I is more ordered and exhibits only moderate conductivity. The disorder
in the S2–/BH4– distribution
indicates that the Li6PS5(BH4) crystal
exhibits high lithium-ion conductivity. The increase in the lattice
parameter should also affect the conductivity of the crystal. The
argyrodite-type Li6PS5(BH4) phase
refined here is a novel lithium-ion conductor. In this study, the
Rietveld refinements were performed using the XRD data of the low
crystallinity sample. The Rietveld refinements for the neutron diffraction
data of high crystallinity samples are necessary to determine more
accurate atomic coordinates for hydrogen and lithium.

The conductivity of the heat-treated x = 50 sample
was 1.9 × 10–3 S cm–1 at
25 °C, which is almost similar to that of as-obtained samples.
It is clear that the Li6PS5(BH4)
phase is more Li-rich compared with the (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 (x = 50) solid electrolytes.
This suggests that the glass matrix of the x = 50
sample has a lower Li+ ion concentration than its nominal
composition. However, the x = 50 solid electrolytes
that included the Li6PS5(BH4) phase
and glass matrix exhibited a high lithium-ion conductivity of more
than 10–3 S cm–1. This suggests
that both the glass matrix and Li6PS5(BH4) phase display high lithium-ion conductivities. It is deemed
necessary to synthesize single Li6PS5(BH4) phase crystals and examine their conductivity in the future.

All-solid-state cells using mechanochemically prepared Li2S–P2S5–LiBH4 solid
electrolytes with an argyrodite structure were assembled in order
to show their potentials for practical applications. Figure 7 shows the charge–discharge
curves of the all-solid-state cells using (a) Li/TiS2,
(b) In/LiCoO2, and (c) In/LiFePO4 and the x = 50 sample. All of the all-solid-state cells using Li2S–P2S5–LiBH4 was successfully charged and discharged with the large capacities
comparable to the previously reported all-solid-state cells.2,31 There are few reports of the all-solid-state cells with a LiFePO4 positive electrode material. The all-solid-state cell using
Li metal was also charged and discharged. The Li2S–P2S5–LiBH4 solid electrolytes have
high potential for practical use.

cells using 50(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·50LiBH4: (a) Li/TiS2, (b) In/LiCoO2, and (c) In/LiFePO4. The operating conditions
are shown in the figures.

4 Conclusions
In this study, (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 solid electrolytes were
prepared by a mechanochemical process.
Glassy samples were obtained in the composition range for x (mol %) from 0 to 33, and samples with argyrodite crystalline
phase were obtained at x > 33. The DSC curves
for
the samples with LiBH4 did not exhibit the peak attributed
to the phase transition of LiBH4. The Raman spectra of
the (100 – x)(0.75Li2S·0.25P2S5)·xLiBH4 samples
displayed bands attributed to both BH4– and PS43– ions. In the glass-forming
region, the conductivity of the glass increased with increasing LiBH4 content. The x = 50 samples that included
newly formed crystal phases also exhibited a high conductivity of
1.8 × 10–3 S cm–1 at 25 °C
and a low conduction activation energy of 16 kJ mol–1. Through Rietveld refinements of the x = 50 sample,
the novel crystal phase was identified as an argyrodite-type crystal,
Li6PS5(BH4). The disorder of the
S2–/BH4– distribution
indicates that the argyrodite-type crystal Li6PS5(BH4) exhibits high lithium-ion conductivity.
