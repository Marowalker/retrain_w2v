We investigate the
band shift and band alignment of two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus
(BP)/MoS2 van der Waals heterojunction (vdW HJ) via uniaxial
strain in terms of first-principles calculations and atomic-bond-relaxation
method. We find that the band gap of 2D BP/MoS2 HJ decreases
linearly with applied tensile strain and Mo–S bond breaks down
at 10% tensile strain. Meanwhile, the band gap slightly increases
and then monotonically decreases under compressive strain and there
appears a semiconductor-to-metal transition at −11 and −12%
strain in the y and x directions,
respectively. Moreover, 2D BP/MoS2 HJ maintains type-II
band alignment for strain applied in the y direction
whereas type-II/I band transition appears at −5% strain in
the x direction. Moreover, we propose an analytical
model to address the strain-modulated band engineering of 2D BP/MoS2 vdW HJ at the atomic level. Our results suggest a promising
way to explain the intrinsic mechanism of strain engineering and manipulate
the electronic properties of 2D vdW HJs.

1 Introduction
Ultrathin
two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials,
such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and black phosphorus
(BP), have attracted intensive research interest owing to their promising
potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics.1−3 These materials exhibit exotic
properties due to electron confinement and interaction between atomic
layers.4−6 In recent years,
vertical stacking van der Waals heterojunctions (vdW HJs) have become
one of the research foci to design electronic devices with desired
electronic or optoelectronic performances.7−9

Very recently,
several attempts have
been made to explore the properties and potential applications of
2D vdW HJs owing to their novel properties beyond the corresponding
single components, including graphene/hexagonal boron nitride,10 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)/TMDs,11,12 and BP/TMDs,13−15 etc.
In particular, 2D p-BP/n-MoS2 vdW HJ diodes exhibit high
photodetection responsivity and excellent photovoltaic effect at the
wavelength of 633 nm.16 Strikingly, the
HJs of multilayer phosphorene-combined monolayer MoS2 can
be an outstanding solar cell and yield theoretical maximum efficiency
of around 17.5%.17 Moreover, type-II band
alignment of BP/MoS2 HJ can accelerate the separation of
photogenerated carriers, suggesting that it can be a great potential
for an efficient photodetector.18

Importantly, the effective tunability of electronic and optical properties
of 2D HJs is crucial for their various applications. Currently, a
lot of considerations such as strain,19−21 doping,22,23 and applied fields24,25 have been employed to modulate
the electronic and related properties.
Especially, strain engineering was recognized as the best strategy
to control the material properties, since strain can be easily applied
by growing 2D HJs on flexible substrates, without destroying the membrane.
For instance, Sharma et al.26 calculated
the electronic properties of TMD/TMD HJs by using first-principles
calculations and found that the biaxial strain can modulate the band
gap and carrier effective mass as well as carrier mobilities. On the
basis of the photoluminescence (PL) measurements, Li et al.27 reported that the neutral exciton peak and charged
exciton peak of WS2/MoS2 HJ shows a linear redshift
under uniaxial strain with rates of 53 and 62 meV/% strain, respectively.
Also, He et al.28 demonstrated that both
direct and indirect band gaps of MoSe2/WSe2 HJ
decrease with applied biaxial strain.

Although several achievements
have been obtained on strain engineering of monolayer MoS2 and BP,19,29−31 a systematic study exploring
the electronic and mechanical
properties of BP/MoS2 HJ under uniaxial strain is still
lacking. For example, the evolutions of the band gap energy and band
shift of BP/MoS2 HJ under in-plane uniaxial strain are
completely unknown. In particular, the limit of the strain strength
and similarities and different evolutions of band structures in BP/MoS2 HJ under imposed uniaxial strain in the y and x directions remain unclear. In addition, the
underlying mechanism on the strain engineering of 2D BP/MoS2 HJ at the atomic level is still ambiguous.

Therefore, in this
contribution, we investigate the effect of uniaxial strain on the
electronic properties of BP/MoS2 HJ by first-principles
calculations and atomic-bond-relaxation (ABR) consideration.32−35 It
is demonstrated that the band gap and band edge of BP/MoS2 HJ can be effectively modulated by uniaxial strain. For the case
of BP/MoS2 HJ, the atomic bonds break down and a semiconductor-to-metal
transition occurs at the critical strain. In addition, the BP/MoS2 HJ maintains type-II band alignment for strain applied in
the y direction, whereas type-II band alignment changes
to type-I at −5% compressive strain in the x direction. Moreover, we establish an analytic model to address the
strain-dependent band gap and band shift of BP/MoS2 HJ
in terms of ABR consideration. Our results reveal the underlying mechanism
of uniaxial strain modulation on electronic properties of BP/MoS2 HJ, which provides new insights toward the comprehension
of strain engineering, suggesting an effective route for the applications
of BP/MoS2 vdW HJ in flexible electronics and optoelectronics.

2 Computational Details
In this study, first-principles
calculations are performed by using
the Virtual Nanolab Atomistix ToolKit (ATK) package with the density
functional theory (DFT).36 The generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) within Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof37 is adopted for electron exchange-correlation
function. The electron wave function is expanded using a double zeta
polarized basis set. The electron temperature is set to 300 K, and
mesh cutoff energy is set at 310 Ry. The supercell of BP/MoS2 HJ was chosen with a periodic boundary condition. The Brillouin
zone of the simulation supercell was sampled with a 20 × 5 ×
1 Monkhorst–Pack k-grid mesh in our calculations.38 A vacuum spacing larger than 15 Å was used
to minimize the interaction between adjacent monolayers. All atomic
positions and lattice constants were optimized by using the limited-memory
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm. All
atoms are optimized until the force on each atom is less than 0.01
eV/Å, and the maximum stress tolerance of each atom is less than
0.0005 eV/Å3. The vdW interaction between the monolayers
was considered in our calculations by adding a semiempirical DFT-D2
method of Grimme.39 We have further calculated
the band gap of BP/MoS2 HJ under uniaxial strain using
local density approximation (LDA)40 as
the exchange-correlation functional to verify the reliability of the
GGA calculation method, and we obtained very similar trends in the
two calculation methods.

3 Theoretical Model
Generally, the abrupt termination of bonding
network at the surface and interface will leave a lot of dangling
bonds and coordination deficiencies, which will generate completely
new effects, resulting in distinctive features compared to those of
their corresponding bulk.41−43 Thus, the system will remain
in a self-equilibrium state based on
the atomic-bond-relaxation (ABR) mechanism.32,33,44 The lattice periodicity and the Hamiltonian
of the system will change, which will tailor the electronic and related
properties.34,35,45

In fact, for bilayer HJs, the epitaxial layer will relax to
a self-equilibrium
state due to surface relaxation and interfacial mismatch; thus, the
mass, charge, and energy will redistribute. The lattice constants
will undergo converse variation in the in-plane direction due to lattice
mismatch, and the out-of-plane bond
angles will also change due to Poisson’s effect. Notably, the
schematic illustration of a bilayer HJ consisting of BP and MoS2 is shown in Figure 1. In general, the bilayer is constrained by bending but can
be freely stretched or contracted in the in-plane direction. Ignore
the effect of dislocation formation; the matched strain can be calculated
as: εm = (aB – aM)/aM owing to the
difference of lattice constants of BP (aB) and MoS2 (aM).46 Thus, the deformation compatibility is determined
by 1  where εM0 and εB0 are the mean elastic extensional
strain in the MoS2 and BP, respectively. Noticeably, the
internal plane perpendicular to the interface must satisfy the mechanical
balance under the condition of self-equilibrium state,46 obeying 2  where YM and YB denote Young’s
modulus of MoS2 and BP and tM and tB are the thickness of MoS2 and BP, respectively. For bilayer BP/MoS2 HJ,
under uniaxial strain, the total strain in MoS2 and BP
is 3  where εj(j = x,y) = (Lj – L0j)/L0j is the uniaxial tensile strain, whereas Lj and L0j are the strained length of the superunit
and that of the corresponding equilibrium length, respectively.

cell of BP, MoS2, and supercell of the HJ, respectively.
(c) Total energy of BP/MoS2 HJ as a function of the vertical
distance d. (d) Dependence the total energy on the
displacement in the x and y directions.

Naturally, the interaction potential
of monolayer MoS2 is determined by the bond parameters,
which can be expressed by47,48 4  Here, Ebond = D ×
[1 – e–α(hij–h)2]2, , and Ec = C·qiqj/hij denote the bond-stretching energy,
the bond angle variation energy, and the Coulomb electrostatic energy,
where D, α, kθ, and kψ are the potential parameters, qi and qj are the
local electrostatic charges of the atoms i and j, Δθ and
Δψ are the changes in-plane and out-of-plane S–Mo–S
bond angles, hij is the distance between
atoms i and j, and C is the Coulomb electrostatic
potential parameter, respectively.

Notably, the Stillinger–Weber
(SW) potential49 has been proved suitable
for the description of the potential of BP with the bond-stretching
interaction and bond angle bending interaction. Thus, the total potential
energy is50,51 5  with  and  where V2(i, j) and V3(i, j, k) are the two-body and there-body terms, respectively; Aij, Bij, and Kijk are the fitting coefficients, rij is the distance between atom i and atom j, θijk is the angle between bond ij and jk, rmij is the corresponding
cutoff distance, and θ0 is the equilibrium angle
between two bonds.50,51

Furthermore, in 2D layered
structures, different layers are weakly bonded to each other by vdW
force, which is much weaker than that of the covalent intralayer interaction.
In general, the interlayer vdW interaction is described by the well-known
Lennard-Jones form,44,52 6  where r is the distance
between two interacting atoms. ξ
and σ are the potential parameters that can be extracted by
the standard geometric combination rules for HJs constructed using
different layered materials, i.e.,  and σ = (σM + σB)/2, where ξM(σM) and ξB(σB) are potential parameters of MoS2 and BP, respectively.52

Considering the joint effect of lattice mismatch and uniaxial strain,
the cohesive energy of a unit cell is 7  where z1i = 4 is the CN of monolayer MoS2 or BP
and N refers to the number of atoms.32 In addition, the bond order loss of the surface atoms will
cause the system to contract spontaneously, resulting in the relaxation
of interaction potential between atoms. The single-bond energy of
the system will relax from the Ebi of the bulk to the E1i = c1i–miEbi of the monolayer, where m is the bond nature factor
and c1i = 2/(1 + exp((12
– z1i)/8z1i)) is the bond contraction
coefficient.

Furthermore, the band gap energy (Eg) of the system is mainly determined by the first Fourier
series of the lattice period potential.44,53 In addition,
the band gap of the system is proportional to the single-bond energy Eg ∝ ⟨E0⟩ = EC/NZ.44 Thus, the band gap of a monolayer
MoS2 (BP) under uniaxial tensile strain can be expressed
as 8  where ; the former denotes the perturbation
caused
by the size, and the latter is the perturbation induced by the uniaxial
strain and interlayer vdW interaction, respectively; Egib is the band gap of the bulk.

Moreover, the shifts of
conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are tightly
related to the effective mass of electron and hole, i.e., ΔECBM ∝ 1/me and ΔEVBM ∝ 1/mh, respectively, where me and mh are the effective mass of electron and hole.54 Therefore, the offsets of CBM and VBM can be
derived as 9  

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Band
Structure of BP/MoS2 HJ
The simulated structures
of BP/MoS2 HJ are depicted
in Figure 1. Notably,
the top and side view structures of BP/MoS2 HJ are shown
in Figure 1a,b. The
optimized lattice parameters of monolayer BP are aB = 3.31 Å and bB = 4.54
Å, and the lattice parameters of monolayer MoS2 are aM = 3.19 Å and bM = 5.52 Å. The supercell of BP/MoS2 HJ is constructed
from a 5 × 1 (armchair × zigzag) unit cell of BP and a 4
× 1 (armchair × zigzag) unit cell of MoS2, and
the optimized lattice constants for the supercell are a = 3.25 Å and b = 22.08 Å.

To determine
the equilibrium state of BP/MoS2 HJs, we consider the total
energy with varying interlayer distances and lateral displacements,
as shown in Figure 1c,d. Clearly, the total energy shows an obvious dependence on the
interlayer distance and the equilibrium distance is 3.24 Å. Furthermore,
the total energy increases with the displacements of BP both along
the x and y directions (see Figure 1a), indicating that
the initial bilayer stacking is the most stable configuration.

Next, we calculate the band gaps of monolayer BP and MoS2. In our calculation, the selected supercell of monolayer BP (MoS2) is consistent with that before the formation of HJ. Also,
the band gaps of monolayer BP and MoS2 are 0.94 and 1.68
eV, respectively, which is consistent with the previous calculations.55,56 The projected band structure and the Brillouin zone with high-symmetry k points are presented in Figure 2a. In the figure, the blue (red) dots represent
the contribution of BP (MoS2) to the band structure and
the size of dots indicates the contributions of each layer. Clearly,
the CBM of the HJ located at the middle of Γ and X (Γ–X)
high-symmetry points is mainly from the MoS2, whereas the
VBM, also located at Γ–X points, is from BP. Significantly,
BP is an indirect band gap with a value of 0.90 eV and MoS2 is an indirect band gap of 1.35 eV, and the HJ possesses an indirect
band gap of 0.48 eV. Evidently, our calculations are in good agreement
with the previous results,13,18 indicating that the
method is feasible. The band gaps of BP and MoS2 in the
HJ are slightly smaller than those in the monolayer. This can be attributed
to the interlayer vdW interaction and the interface lattice mismatch.
More importantly, the essential electronic properties of the corresponding
monolayers have been largely preserved,24 which can serve as the ideal substrates for each other without undue
disturbance of their intrinsic electronic structures.

and band alignment of BP/MoS2 HJ. The blue dots and red
dots mark band contributions from BP and MoS2, respectively.
(b) The PDOS of BP/MoS2 HJ. The Fermi level is set to zero.

In nature,
the band alignment of vdW HJs plays an important role for the application
and design of electronic nanodevices. Figure 2a shows the band alignment of BP/MoS2 HJ. Obviously, it exhibits the character of type-II band
alignment. The CBM is 0.24 eV for MoS2 and 0.66 eV for
BP, whereas the VBM is −1.10 eV for MoS2 and −0.24
eV for BP in the HJ. The CBM of MoS2 sheet is lower than
that of BP, whereas the conduction band offset ΔEC = EB–C – EM–C (EB(M)–C and EB(M)–V are the CBM and VBM
of BP (MoS2) in the HJ) is 0.42 eV. Also, the VBM of BP
is higher than that of MoS2 and the valence band offset
ΔEV = EB–V – EM–V is 0.86 eV. It
is indicated that the p-type BP and n-type MoS2 layers
form a type-II HJ, which favors the separation of carrier electrons
and holes, making the BP/MoS2 HJ a kind of a good candidate
for applications in nanoelectronic devices and solar cells.

To understand the different electronic properties for constructing a
HJ and assembling each monolayer, we further analyze the partial density
of states (PDOS) of the monolayer MoS2 (BP) and BP/MoS2 HJ. In Figure 2b, it is revealed that the electronic properties of the BP layer
are mainly determined by the local state density of the 3p orbital
of P atom and those of the MoS2 layer are mainly determined
by the 4d orbital of Mo atom and the 3p of S atom. The CBM of the
HJ is mainly contributed by the Mo dz2, dxy, dz2–y2 and S px, py states;
these atomic orbital contributions are the same as those of the monolayer
MoS2, whereas the VBM of HJ is mainly contributed by the
P pz, py,
and s states. However, the atomic orbital superimposition is different
from that of the monolayer BP (the VBM of the monolayer BP is mainly
contributed by the P pz and s states)
due to interlayer vdW interaction.

4.2 Band
Shift of BP/MoS2 HJ under Uniaxial
Strain in the y Direction
To investigate
the effect of applied strain on the electronic properties of BP/MoS2 HJ, we explore the evolutions of band structure in BP/MoS2 HJ under uniaxial strain along the y and x directions, respectively. The uniaxial strain is defined
as εy = (b – b0)/b0 and εx = (a – a0)/a0, where b(a) and b0(a0) are the strained and unstrained supercell parameters,
respectively.

Figure 3a–e shows the band structures of BP/MoS2 HJ under −5, −2, 0, 2, and 5% strain applied in the y direction. In the figures, we can see that the BP/MoS2 HJ remains in typical type-II band alignment with indirect
band gap and the CBM of HJ is dominated by MoS2 and the
VBM is dominated by BP. Under the approach of tensile strain, the
CBM of HJ is at Γ–X points and gradually approaches to
Γ point, whereas the VBM of HJs is also at Γ–X
points and gradually moves away from Γ point as the tensile
strain increases. Although the CBM and VBM of BP/MoS2 HJ
show an opposite trend, the HJ has an indirect band gap. In the case
of compressive strain, the CBM of HJ gradually moves away from the
Γ point, which shows a reverse trend with tensile strain. Moreover,
the VBM of HJ first changes from Γ–X points to the Γ
point (at −2%) and then from the Γ point to the Y−Γ
points (at −4%) as the compressive strain increases.

Figure 3 (a–e)
Projected
band structures of BP/MoS2 HJ under −5, −2,
0, 2, and 5% uniaxial strain in the y direction,
respectively.

Figure 4 depicts the
evolutions of band gap (GGA and LDA) and band edge of BP/MoS2 HJ as a function of uniaxial strain in the y direction.
In detail, from Figure 4a, we can see that the band gap of the HJ exhibits a monotonic decrease
with tensile strain from 0.48 to 0.27 eV when the HJ is under the
tensile strain from 0 to 9%. The reason is that the CBM of MoS2 in the HJ continuously decreases with strain and the VBM
of BP moves toward the Fermi level as the strain increases (see Figure 4b). Importantly,
when the tensile strain is 10%, the Mo–S bonds in the HJ break
down and the system reaches the limit of the tensile strength. The
mechanical properties of MoS2 in the HJ are slightly different
from those of monolayer MoS2. Similarly, the related experiments
show that a monolayer MoS2 can withstand up to 11% isotropic
strain.57 For the case of compressive strain
range of −2–0%, the CBM of MoS2 increases
with the increase of compressive strain and the VBM of BP decreases
with increasing strain, resulting in the enhancement of band gap of
HJs from 0.48 to 0.51 eV. When the compressive strain is greater than
−2%, however, the CBM of MoS2 and VBM of BP move
toward the Fermi level as the compressive strain increases so the
band gap of the HJ continuously decreases with increasing strain.
Strikingly, when the compressive strain reaches −11%, the band
gap of the HJ decreases to 0 eV and the BP/MoS2 HJ experiences
a semiconductor-to-metal transition. Interestingly, these trends are
consistent with the previous calculations.26,58 In
addition, Figure 4a
shows the ΔEC increases linearly
with tensile strain and decreases linearly with compressive strain,
whereas the ΔEV exhibits the reverse
character. In Figure 4b, we can see the CBM of BP under tensile strain increases monotonously
with the increase of strain and the VBM of MoS2 continuously
moves to the Fermi level as the strain increases. The CBM of BP under
compressive strain decreases with the increase of compressive strain,
whereas the VBM of MoS2 keeps decreasing with increase
of compressive strain far away from the Fermi level.

predictions for the band gap of BP (MoS2) counterparts
(c) and the band edge of BP/MoS2 HJ versus the uniaxial
strain in the y direction (d). EB(M)–C and EB(M)–V are the CBM and VBM of BP (MoS2) in HJ.

Furthermore,
the theoretical predictions in terms of ABR consideration are also
shown in Figure 4c,d.
Evidently, the band gap energy of MoS2 increases with compression
strain and decreases with tensile strain in the range of −5–5%
strain whereas BP possesses an opposite tendency. Actually, for the
case of BP/MoS2 HJ, the lattice constant will be extension
and contraction at in-plane direction due to interface effect and
the intrinsic strain is −1.78% (−2.81%) for BP and 2.18%
(0.06%) for MoS2, respectively. As a consequence, the epitaxial
layers will relax to a self-equilibrium state. Especially, it is necessary
to consider the contributions of imposed strain, intrinsic interface
strain, and interlayer vdW interaction in the HJ under the condition
of applied uniaxial strain.

To analyze the strain engineering
on electronic properties of BP/MoS2 HJ substantially, we
plot the variations of PDOS of HJ with strain of −5 and 5%,
as shown in Figure 5a,b. For the HJ without strain, the main contribution of the states
at CBM comes from Mo dz2, dxy, dz2–y2 and S py, px states whereas the VBM is
from P pz, py states. In the case of −5%, the states at CBM and VBM are
from Mo dz2, dz2–y2, dxy, S py, px, and P py, pz orbits, respectively. Under uniaxial
compressive strain, the VBM is not contributed by the same electronic
components but mainly contributed by the p orbital of P atom and from
pz to py.
Therefore, we believe that the electronic component of VBM is changed
under the compressive strain, leading to a band gap reduction for
the BP/MoS2 HJs. At a strain of 5%, the states at CBM and
VBM are from Mo dz2, dxy, dz2–y2, S px, py, and P pz, py, respectively. Therefore, it can
be found that the electronic component of CBM and VBM is not changed
under tensile strain yet the Mo 4d and P 3d orbits move closer to
the Fermi level with increasing strain, thereby lowering the band
gap.

strain in the y direction.

4.3 Band Shift
of BP/MoS2 HJ under Uniaxial Strain in the x Direction
Figure 6a–e shows the band structures of BP/MoS2 HJ under the condition of −5, −2, 0, 2, and 5% strain
applied in the x direction. Evidently, the band structure
of HJ varies greatly when the strain is applied in the x direction compared to that when the strain is applied in the y direction. In addition, the BP/MoS2 HJ will
change from type-II to type-I under certain critical strains. Under
tensile strain, the CBM of HJ gradually moves away from the Γ
point as the strain increases and the VBM approaches the Γ point,
which changes from Γ–X points to the Γ point at
2% strain. Noticeably, these results have the opposite trends compared
to those of strain applied in the y direction. In
the case of compressive strain, the CBM of BP gradually decreases
and CBM of MoS2 increases, leading to the CBM of HJ changing
from MoS2 to BP and the CBM of HJ is from Γ–X
points to Γ point at −5% strain; also HJ appears to have
type-II/I band alignment transition. Moreover, the VBM of HJ is at
the Γ–X points and remains away from the Γ point
as the compressive strain increases.

Figure 6 (a–e) Projected band structures
of BP/MoS2 HJ under
−5, −2, 0, 2, and 5% uniaxial strain in the x direction, respectively.

Figure 7 depicts
the evolutions of band gap (GGA
and LDA) and band edge of the BP/MoS2 HJ as a function
of applied uniaxial strain in the x direction. In
detail, from Figure 7a, we can see that the band gaps of HJ decrease monotonically under
tensile strain and the values change from 0.48 to 0.04 eV. Importantly,
we found that the Mo–S bonds in the HJ break down to the limit
at the 10% tensile strain,
which is the same as that when the strain is imposed in the y direction. Under compressive strain, the band gap of the
HJ increases linearly with the increase of strain in the range of
−4–0%. When the compressive strain is larger than −4%,
the CBM and VBM of HJ (CBM and VBM of BP) are close to the Fermi level
as the strain increases and the band gap of the HJ decreases as the
strain increases. Strikingly, when the strain is −12%, the
band gap of the HJ decreases to 0 eV, which means that the HJ undergoes
a semiconductor-to-metal transition. Obviously, the ΔEC and ΔEV of
HJ are different from the case when the strain is applied in the y direction, as shown in Figure 7a. The ΔEC increases linearly with the increase of strain in the range of 0–5%
tensile strain and decreases linearly with strain that is greater
than 5%. The change trend of ΔEV tends to a stable average of 0.82 eV throughout the strain process.
In Figure 7b, the CBM
of BP increases during the tensile strain in the range of 0–5%,
then decreases when the strain is greater than 5%. Also, the VBM of
MoS2 continuously moves to the Fermi level as the tensile
strain increases, whereas the CBM of BP gradually decreases with increasing
strain and the VBM of BP is away from the Fermi level at 0–5%
and moves to the Fermi level when the compressive strain is greater
than 5%. Moreover, the CBM and VBM of MoS2 under compressive
strain are away from the Fermi level at 0–8 and 0–6%
and approach to the Fermi level when the strain becomes larger.

and LDA),

and theoretical predictions for the band gap of BP (MoS2) counterparts (c) and band edge of BP/MoS2 HJ versus
the uniaxial strain in the x direction (d). EB(M)–C and EB(M)–C are the CBM and VBM of BP (MoS2) in HJ.

Figure 7c,d shows
the theoretical predictions of band shift of HJ under uniaxial strain
applied in the x direction. Evidently, the band gap
of MoS2 increases with compression strain and decreases
with tensile strain in the range of −5–5% strain, whereas
BP possesses an opposite tendency, which is consistent with the uniaxial
strain applied in the y direction. Actually, the
mechanical properties of BP show obviously anisotropy whereas MoS2 shows isotropy. Also, the band gap is determined by the atomic
distance and interaction potential. Thus, our method provides an approach
to connect the band offset and band alignment with uniaxial strain
through bond identities, demonstrating that strain engineering has
great potential for tunable electronic devices.

Meanwhile, we
also analyzed the PDOS of BP/MoS2 HJ under the imposed
strain in the x direction. In detail, the PDOS of
HJ with a strain of −5 and 5% is presented in Figure 8a,b. In the case of −5%,
the states at CBM and VBM are from P pz, py, px,
and s and P pz, s, and py orbits, respectively. Under compressive strain, the states
of Mo 4d and S 3p shift away from the Fermi level and the state of
P 3p has an opposite trend, leading to the HJ changes from type-II
to type-I at −5% strain. Moreover, the states at CBM and VBM
are from Mo dz2, dz2–y2, dxy, S py, px and P pz, py s orbits at 5% strain. These states
are close to the Fermi level as the tensile strain increases, resulting
in a decrease of band gap. Therefore, the electronic properties of
HJs can be effectively modulated by the strain engineering.26,59

In fact, the change of electronic properties of BP/MoS2 HJ under uniaxial strain applied in y and x directions is different. From the first-principles calculations,
the band gap displays a linear trend against the uniaxial tensile
strain and increases first and drops at the end under the uniaxial
compressive strain applied in both y and x directions. However, the band gap of the BP/MoS2 HJ reaches a maximum and the semiconductor-to-metal transition occurs
in two directions with different compressive strains. In addition,
the changes of CBM and VBM in BP/MoS2 HJ show an opposite
trend in the y and x directions,
as well as a transformation from type-II to type-I can be found when
the uniaxial compressive strain is applied in the x direction. According to the ABR consideration, the band gaps of
BP and MoS2 in HJ show the same trend when the uniaxial
strain is applied but the changes of band edges are different. In
fact, the discrepancy of band edge shift in both directions can be
attributed to the different intrinsic strains at two directions and
the anisotropicity of BP layer.

5 Conclusions
In summary, the band engineering
of BP/MoS2 vdW HJs via uniaxial strain is investigated
by first-principles calculations and ABR mechanism. Our results show
that the band gap and band edge of BP/MoS2 HJ can be effectively
modulated by uniaxial strain. Under uniaxial tensile strain (x or y directions), the band gap of HJs
monotonically decreases with strain, until the Mo–S bonds break
down at 10% strain. However, under uniaxial compressive strain, the
band gap increases slightly at first and then monotonically decreases,
as well as the BP/MoS2 HJ has a semiconductor-to-metal
transition at −11% uniaxial compressive strain in the y direction and at −12% uniaxial compressive strain
in the x direction. In particular, the BP/MoS2 HJ has the type-II band alignment with p-type BP and n-type
MoS2 under the uniaxial strain in the y direction, which is beneficial in applications of solar cells and
logical devices. In addition, the BP/MoS2 HJ will change
from type-II to type-I at −5% compressive strain in the x direction. Furthermore, we propose an analytical model
to clarify the physical mechanism on the uniaxial strain tunable band
gap and band edges of BP/MoS2 HJ on the basis of ABR mechanism.
Importantly, our results agree well with the available evidence, which
provides physical insights into band engineering of BP/MoS2 HJ and indicates the potential applications in flexible electronics
and photovoltaic cells.
