Catalysis, particularly
metal-catalyzed reactions in microemulsion systems, offers a sustainable
approach for organic reactions in water. However, it is still a challenging
task because of the complex role of the nonionic surfactant in such
a system and the interaction of the phase behavior and reaction performance.
To get a profound knowledge of this role and interaction, a systematic
study of the palladium-catalyzed hydroxycarbonylation of 1-dodecene
in a microemulsion system is reported. The influence of the temperature,
additives such as cosolvents, the catalyst concentration, and the
hydrophilicity of the surfactant and its concentration has been investigated
with regard to both the phase behavior and reaction performance. Interestingly,
the investigations reveal that not the phase behavior of the microemulsion
system but mainly the dimension of the oil–water interface
and the local concentrations of the substrates at this interface,
which is provided by the amount and hydrophilicity of the surfactant,
control the reaction performance of hydroxycarbonylation in these
systems. Moreover, it was found that the local concentration of the
active catalyst complex at the interface is essential for the reaction
performance. Dependent on the surface active properties of the catalyst
complex, its bulk concentration, and the nature and amount of additives,
the local concentration of the active catalyst complex at the interface
is strongly influenced, which has a huge impact on the reaction performance.

1 Introduction
The
application of biphasic catalysis represents a smart approach to perform
homogeneously catalyzed reactions in an economical and ecological
way. The major advantage is the possibility to separate the product
from the reaction mixture and to recycle the expensive catalyst via
a simple phase separation step after the reaction. In industry, the
Ruhrchemie/Rhône Poulenc process was the first successful example
of biphasic catalysis, where in a hydroformylation reaction, propene
is converted to butanal using synthesis gas (mixture of CO and H2). The applied rhodium catalyst is immobilized into the water
phase by the water-soluble ligand TPPTS. Therefore, it can be recycled
via a simple phase separation step. The rhodium leaching into the
product phase is lower than 1 ppb, which equals to a loss of only
2 kg of rhodium per 2 000 000 tons of butanal.1 Besides aqueous–organic systems, plenty
of innovative biphasic media are considered as smart solvents for
homogeneous catalysis, with the goal to overcome the limitations of
“ordinary” biphasic systems caused by low solubility
of substrates or mass transport in the aqueous phase.2 An easy approach to solve this problem is the addition
of cosolvents to the aqueous or organic phase, which leads to a higher
solubility of the substrates in the catalyst phase and thus to a higher
overall reaction performance.3 Moreover,
the addition of cyclodextrins, acting as mass transfer promoters,
is a promising tool to enhance the catalytic activity in aqueous biphasic
systems.4,5 In contrast, nonaqueous liquid/liquid biphasic
systems including flourous biphasic systems,6,7 thermo-regulated
organic liquid/liquid systems,8,9 and ionic liquids/supercritical
fluids biphasic systems10 are in focus
of current research. However, these systems do not meet the requirements
of sustainability because of the use of often toxic solvents. Water,
on the other hand, fulfills the requirements of a “green”
solvent but, as already mentioned, offers only a limited solubility
for many organic substrates.

A smart approach to make water
applicable as a solvent for a broader range of substrates is the use
of surfactants, which is reviewed in the literature for plenty of
different organic transformations.11−13 If large amounts of
the organic substrate are added to the micellar solution, microemulsion
systems are obtained. Since the first introduction of the term “microemulsion”
by J. H. Schulman in the 1950s, numerous publications on the formation,
physical properties, and the application of microemulsions sprout
up.14,15 Microemulsions are mixtures of two immiscible
liquids, predominantly water and oil, with an amphiphile as an emulsifier.
The phase behavior can be easily described by the Gibbs phase prism
in which the base of this prism represents the ternary system of oil,
water, and the amphiphile (Figure 1, left). The composition of the ternary system is characterized
by the surfactant concentration γ, denoted as the mass fraction
of the amphiphile to the total mass of the microemulsion system (eq 1), and the oil mass fraction
α in the water–oil mixture (eq 2). 1   2  

Figure 1 Gibbs phase prism for a microemulsion
system consisting of oil, water, and a nonionic surfactant (left picture)
and cut of the phase prism at α = 0.5 (right picture), both
taken from Schwarze et al.16

The Gibbs phase prism can be reduced to Kahlweit’s
fish diagram, which is created by cutting the Gibbs phase prism at
a fixed oil mass fraction α, as exemplarily illustrated in Figure 1 (right). The phase
boundaries resemble the shape of the fish where the body of the fish
represents the three-phase region of the microemulsion system. In
the fish-diagram, γo marks the minimal concentration
of surfactant, which is needed to form a microemulsion system. The
solubility of the nonionic surfactant changes with the temperature,
causing the transition of the system between different phase states.
At low temperatures, the nonionic surfactant is more hydrophilic and
thus is mainly soluble in the water phase, forming an oil-in-water
microemulsion with an excess oil phase (2Φ).
In contrast, increasing the temperature leads to a water-in-oil microemulsion
with an excess water phase (2̅Φ) caused by the higher
solubility of the surfactant in the corresponding oil phase. In between,
the mixture forms a three-phase region in which the middle phase is
a surfactant-rich microemulsion phase. At high surfactant concentrations,
the microemulsion system reaches a macroscopic one phase state. The
minimal surfactant concentration, at which a one phase microemulsion
is obtained, is denoted with γ̃ with the associated temperature T̃.

In general, surfactants increase the solubility
of the substrate in the aqueous phase as well as the interfacial area
between oil and water, which facilitates and accelerates the reaction.
The applicability of surfactants for homogeneously metal-catalyzed
reactions is demonstrated with numerous examples in the literature.17−19 Especially, the pharmaceutical industry benefits from the use of
surfactants in the reaction sequence for pharmaceutical active ingredients,
by avoiding toxic solvents, simplifying purification steps, and decreasing
the environmental impact.20 However, industrial
application of surfactant-based systems as reaction media is still
rare because of insufficient knowledge of the function of surfactants
as promoters in biphasic catalysis.

Recently, we reported about
the special role of nonionic surfactants during catalysis in microemulsion
systems for the rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of 1-dodecene.21 It became apparent that not the phase behavior
of the microemulsion system but the type of surfactant determines
the reaction performance. The surfactant enlarges the interfacial
area between water and oil, defining the local concentration of the
substrates and the concentration of the surface active catalyst complex
at the interface. As a result of these investigations, the applicability
of microemulsion systems is mainly influenced by an appropriate surfactant
chosen as the emulsifier. In this contribution, we want to verify
these important findings for catalysis in microemulsion systems with
another industrial relevant catalytic reaction: the palladium-catalyzed
hydroxycarbonylation of 1-dodecene (see Figure 2). Mortreux and collaborators were the first,
who investigated the hydroxycarbonylation of alkenes in biphasic systems.22,23 Dependent on the reaction conditions and the catalyst system, the
corresponding linear (l) and branched (b) acid can be formed, determining
the l/b regioselectivity of the reaction.

In this case, water acts as both solvent and substrate,
complicating the reaction system compared to the hydroformylation
reaction. Hence, palladium-catalyzed hydroxycarbonylation is suitable
to find a general approach for catalysis in microemulsion systems.
Herein, the main focus has been set on the impact of the phase behavior
of the applied microemulsion system on the resulting reaction performance.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Temperature and
Surfactant Concentration
As stated in Section 1, the phase behavior of microemulsion systems
depends mainly on the temperature and the mass fractions of oil (α)
and surfactant (γ). To evaluate the reaction performance in
terms of the phase behavior, the oil content was fixed to α
= 0.5 and the so called Kahlweit fish diagram (Figure 3) of the microemulsion system consisting
of 1-dodecene, dodecane, water, and the technical grade surfactant
Marlipal 24/50 was exemplarily recorded as the benchmark system.

Figure 3 Phase
diagram of a mixture of 1-dodecene, dodecane, water, and Marlipal
(24/50) with α = 0.5, 1 wt % Na2SO4, Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 (0.02 mmol), Pd/SX/methanesulfonic
acid (MSA)/1-dodecene = 1:4:40:110, and mass ratio 1-dodecene to dodecane
= 1:3 (red line: constant temperature, blue line: constant γ).

Marlipal 24/50 was chosen as the
benchmark surfactant because of several reasons. First, the chemical
structure (see the Supporting Information) is very simple, consisting of a linear alkyl chain and an oligomer
of ethylene oxide. We have to mention that the surfactant is of technical
grade with a certain distribution of ethylene oxide units and an apolar
alkyl chain distribution. Second, no additional functional groups
for example phenyl-groups exist, which could interact with the catalytic
system. Third, the phase inversion temperature of the microemulsion
system consisting of 1-dodecene, dodecane, water, and Marlipal 24/50
is in the middle of the investigated temperature range. Hence, Marlipal
24/50 is appropriate for our investigations. Dodecane was added as
the cosolvent to the oil phase (mass ratio 1-dodecene to dodecane
was 1:3) for maintaining a phase separation and for avoiding rigorous
shifts of the phase diagram because of the formed product tridecanoic
acid during the reaction. Additionally, 1 wt % sodium sulfate was
added to microemulsion systems for destabilizing the emulsion, which
empirically accelerates the time for phase separation by a factor
of 4. We have to mention that the addition of sodium sulfate decreases
the initial rate of hydroxycarbonylation, but the selectivity remains
constant (see the Supporting Information). The impact of salts on the reaction performance and catalyst stability
was investigated in detail for the palladium-catalyzed hydroxycarbonylation
of propene in biphasic systems.24 Nevertheless,
1 wt % sodium sulfate was used because of the enhanced phase separation.
All catalyst components were added to the microemulsion system as
well to observe the phase behavior for the entire reaction mixture.
It has to be mentioned that the investigation on the phase behavior
has been performed without carbon monoxide pressure to avoid any reaction
progress. Indeed, the pressure has an impact on the phase behavior,
but it can be neglected for the mild reaction pressure used in the
reactions.25

The investigated microemulsion
system is characterized by the surfactant concentration γ̃
= 14% and the phase inversion temperature T̃ = 61 °C. An oil-in-water microemulsion with an excess oil phase
(2Φ) is formed at lower temperatures. With increasing temperature,
the system shifts to a water-in-oil microemulsion with an excess water
phase (2̅Φ). In between, a macroscopically triphasic system
is formed in which the middle phase is the microemulsion phase enclosed
by the water-excess and oil-excess phase. Increasing the surfactant
concentration above 14%, oil and water are completely dispersed in
a one phase microemulsion. Interestingly, the catalyst system follows
the surfactant into the corresponding microemulsion phase because
of its surface activity as seen in Figure 4, exemplarily recorded for an increasing
surfactant concentration at a constant temperature. It is mentionable
that the different phases look similar for a constant surfactant concentration
with increasing temperature. The surface activity of the catalyst
complex results from the surface-active ligand SulfoXantPhos, which
was shown in previous publications.26,27 As a result,
the catalyst complex behaves similar to a surfactant and the complex
can be incorporated at the water–oil interface. Hence, the
catalyst can be solubilized either in the continuous water phase (left
picture) and the surfactant-rich phase (middle picture) or even partly
in the oil phase (right picture). The change of color is due to the
different catalyst complex concentrations in the different phases.
Hereby, the dark greenish phases indicate a high concentration of
the applied catalyst complex in the corresponding phase.

Figure 4 Pictures of
the investigated microemulsion systems. Test conditions: T = 85 °C, α = 0.5, 1 wt % Na2SO4, Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 (0.02 mmol), Pd/SX/MSA/1-dodecene
= 1:4:40:110, mass ratio 1-dodecene to dodecane = 1:3, Marlipal 24/50
as the surfactant, γ = 4% (left), γ = 9% (middle), γ
= 14% (right).

On the basis of the phase
behavior of the applied microemulsion system, the influence of temperature
and surfactant concentration has been investigated in terms of reaction
performance to correlate it to the phase behavior of the microemulsion
system. The effect of the surfactant concentration has been investigated
at a constant reaction temperature of 85 °C to ensure the shift
from an oil-in-water to a water-in-oil microemulsion system (see the
red arrow in Figure 3). The conversion of 1-dodecene and the yield to the linear acid
are shown in Figure 5. It was found that the higher the surfactant concentration, the
higher is the conversion, respectively the yield to the linear acid
at a given time. The yield increases from 0.3% with a surfactant concentration
of γ = 0.5 to 42.6% at a surfactant concentration of γ
= 30% after 20 h reaction time. It has to be mentioned that the addition
of surfactant is generally necessary to enable the reaction because
no reaction progress is observed without surfactant as the phase transfer
agent. Furthermore, a critical surfactant concentration is apparently
needed, in this case γ > 3%, to accelerate the reaction substantially.
Below a concentration of γ = 3%, only surfactant monomers are
dissolved in the oil and the water phase, resulting only in a slow
reaction progress. A further increase of the surfactant concentration
leads to a strong enlargement of the interfacial area between the
aqueous and organic phase. Hence, the local concentrations of the
reactants, particularly water, carbon monoxide, and 1-dodecene, at
the interface are increased with increasing amount of surfactant in
the mixture, which results in higher reaction rates shown by higher
yield and conversion.

Figure 5 Effect of surfactant concentration on the hydroxycarbonylation
of 1-dodecene. Experimental conditions: Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 (0.08 mmol), Pd/SX/MSA/1-dodecene (1:4:40:110),
α = 0.5, dodecane as the cosolvent (9 g), water (12 g), Marlipal
24/50 as the surfactant, Na2SO4 (1 wt %), p(CO) = 30 bar, T = 85 °C, n = 1200 rpm, t = 20 h.

As stated in the literature, the rate-determining
step of hydroxycarbonylation is the hydrolysis step,28,29 thus particularly the increased amount of water at the interface
may lead to the higher reaction rate with increasing surfactant concentration.
Furthermore, the local concentration of the active catalyst species
plays a crucial role for the reaction performance. The applied catalyst
complex is negatively charged because of the ligand SulfoXantPhos.
Hence, no electrostatic interaction with the neutral surfactant can
be expected. Nevertheless, the catalyst complex accumulates at the
water–oil interface because of its surface active properties.
Thus, with an increasing interfacial area, the catalyst complex becomes
more and more diluted at the interface because the overall amount
of catalyst in the system remains constant. As a result, the equilibrium
between active and inactive catalyst species might be shifted to a
higher concentration of the active catalyst at the interface, and
with that to a higher reaction rate. To confirm this assumption, we
varied the catalyst concentration at a fixed surfactant concentration
that is a constant interfacial area, which is shown in Section 2.3.

Interestingly,
the phase behavior of the microemulsion system has no strong impact
on the reaction performance of hydroxycarbonylation, which is in good
agreement to the findings for hydroformylation of 1-dodecene in the
same systems.21 The initially prepared
microemulsion system changes from an oil-in-water microemulsion system
at a surfactant concentration of γ = 7% to a macroscopically
three-phase system and finally to a water-in-oil microemulsion system
at γ = 11%. No significant change in the conversion and yield
of the reaction is observed at the shift of the phase states, which
would indicate a change in mass transfer conditions. This means that
not the phase behavior of the microemulsion system but the interfacial
area and the local concentrations of the reactants at the interface
have a major influence on the reaction performance of hydroxycarbonylation.
Moreover, the surfactant concentration has a minor impact on the l/b
regioselectivity of the formed acid. With increasing surfactant concentration,
the l/b selectivity decreases from 64:36 at a surfactant concentration
of γ = 3% to 61:39 at γ = 30%. Because of the increased
interfacial area the isomerization of 1-dodecene takes place with
an increased rate, which leads to the slightly lower l/b selectivity.
It is mentionable that surfactant concentrations above γ = 20%
are not favorable because the one phase region of the microemulsion
system makes a subsequent phase separation for recycling of the catalyst
system rather difficult in comparison to the other multiphase states.

Furthermore, the surfactant concentration was fixed at γ
= 9% to investigate the effect of the temperature on the reaction
(blue arrow in Figure 4). The hydroxycarbonylation of 1-dodecene was carried out at temperatures
ranging from 65 to 105 °C (see Figure 6).

Figure 6 Effect of temperature on the hydroxycarbonylation
of 1-dodecene. Experimental conditions: Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 (0.08 mmol), Pd/SX/MSA/1-dodecene (1:4:40:110),
α = 0.5, dodecane as the cosolvent (9 g), water (12 g), Marlipal
24/50 as the surfactant, γ = 9%, Na2SO4 (1 wt %), p(CO) = 30 bar, n =
1200 rpm, t = 20 h.

Initially, the conversion increases exponentially with increasing
reaction temperature from 8% at 65 °C to 30% at 80 °C, which
is typical for an Arrhenius type behavior, indicating a kinetically
controlled biphasic reaction. After this, the conversion reaches unexpectedly
a plateau between 30 and 35% at higher reaction temperatures. The
yield of the linear acid shows a nearly similar trend but decreases
in the end, resulting in a yield of only 13% at 105 °C. To understand
the decreased yield, the initial rate of hydroxycarbonylation was
calculated from the gas consumption at a conversion of 5%. As illustrated
in Figure 7, the initial
rate of hydroxycarbonylation behaves in the same way, there is an
exponential increase from 2.5 to 10.5 mmol/(L·h), followed by
a inflection point, and a further slightly increase of the initial
rate to a critical value of 18 mmol/(L·h). Interestingly, the
decline in activity cannot be attributed to the change of phase behavior
from an oil-in-water microemulsion to a three-phase system because
this shift already happens at a temperature of 72 °C (see Figure 3). However, palladium
black formation was observed as the precipitate at the reactor wall,
particularly at temperatures above 100 °C, which leads to a decrease
of the amount of the active catalyst. Thus, the initial rate of hydroxycarbonylation
differs from the typical exponential increase and stagnates at higher
temperatures. As described in the literature, palladium black formation
is a specific drawback for homogeneously catalyzed reactions using
palladium.30 We have to mention that the
reaction is not limited by mass transport at high temperatures, which
was confirmed by investigations with variation of the stirrer speed,
resulting in constant reaction rates.

Figure 7 Effect of temperature on the initial rate
and selectivity of the hydroxycarbonylation of 1-dodecene. Experimental
conditions: Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 (0.08
mmol), Pd/SX/MSA/1-dodecene (1:4:40:110), α = 0.5, dodecane
as the cosolvent (9 g), water (12 g), Marlipal 24/50 as the surfactant,
γ = 9%, Na2SO4 (1 wt %), p(CO) = 30 bar, n = 1200 rpm, t =
20 h, initial rate calculated from gas consumption at X = 5%.

In addition, the reaction temperature
influences slightly the l/b regioselectivity to the linear acid. With
increasing temperature from 65 to 105 °C, the regioselectivity
of the linear acid increases from 61 to 70%. The hydrolysis step is
known as the rate-determining step in the hydroxycarbonylation reaction.
Because of the lower activation barrier of the hydrolysis step to
the linear acid, compared to the hydrolysis step to the branched acid,
hydroxycarbonylation at the terminal double bond proceeds faster.29 Thus, the formation of the linear acid is enhanced
with increasing temperature. Furthermore, chemoselectivity is extremely
diminished from nearly 100% at 65 °C to 51% at 105 °C because
an increased temperature enhances the isomerization of 1-dodecene.8 Considering all aspects, the phase behavior,
especially the different phase states of the microemulsion system,
seems to have no influence on the reaction performance of hydroxycarbonylation.
To avoid the isomerization and palladium black formation, the following
investigations were carried out at a reaction temperature of 85 °C.

2.2 Effect of Degree of Ethoxylation (EO)
As
described in the Section 2.1, the amount of surfactant is crucial for the performance
of hydroxycarbonylation in microemulsion systems. To completely understand
the role of the surfactant during the reaction, we investigated the
influence of the surfactant chain length toward both the performance
of hydroxycarbonylation and the phase behavior. Therefore, the hydrophobicity
of the surfactant was changed by varying the degree of EO from 2 to
9 (Marlipal 24/20 to Marlipal 24/90). As expected, the phase behavior
is strongly influenced by the hydrophobicity of the surfactant (Figure 8). The three-phase
region of the resulting microemulsion system is shifted to higher
temperatures with the increasing EO number or rather decreasing hydrophobicity
of the surfactant. The hydrophilic part of the surfactant, consisting
of ethoxy units, undergoes a temperature-dependent conformational
transformation, influencing the water solubility of the corresponding
surfactant. The higher the EO number, the more temperature is needed
to change the conformation of the ethoxy units. As a result of the
conformational transformation, the dipole moment is reduced, resulting
in a lower water solubility. Hence, the hydrophobicity of the surfactant
is increased with higher EO and thus the appearance of the three-phase
region is shifted to higher temperatures. The phase boundaries for
the systems containing the surfactants Marlipal 24/80 and Marlipal
24/90 could not be determined because of the temperature limitation
of the experimental setup.

Figure 8 Phase behavior of 1-dodecene, dodecane, water,
and Marlipal with different degrees of EO. Test conditions: α
= 0.5, γ = 9%, 1 wt % Na2SO4, Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 (0.02 mmol), Pd/SX/MSA/1-dodecene
= 1:4:40:110, mass ratio 1-dodecene to dodecane = 1:3.

Besides the shift in the phase behavior, it was
found that the number of EO groups of the surfactant has a strong
impact on the conversion and yield of hydroxycarbonylation (Figure 9). In general, the
higher the EO number, the higher is the conversion or rather the yield
of the acid. The yield of the linear acid reaches a maximum of 34%
after 20 h reaction time with Marlipal 24/90 as the surfactant. It
is notable that the applied surfactants do not differ in their chemical
structure. Consequently, the difference in the reaction performance
is caused by physical effects, particularly the local concentrations
of the substrates at the interface. The density of the surfactant
film at the oil–water interface might be the reason. With the
increasing number of EO, the thickness of the surfactant film increases,
leading to an enhanced adsorption of the reactants to the interface.
Hence, the reactants are more accumulated at the oil–water
interface with increasing EO number, which enhances the reaction rate.
Similar results were obtained for the rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation
of 1-dodecene in microemulsion systems, which were recently reported
by our group.21 Again, the phase behaviour
of the microemulsion system shows no influence on the reaction performance,
because no discrete changes of the conversion were observed when changing
the phase state by the type of surfactant. We have to mention that
the color of the reaction mixture did not change during the reaction,
concluding that no palladium nanoparticles were formed.

Figure 9 Effect of degree
of EO on hydroxycarbonylation of 1-dodecene. Experimental conditions:
Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 (0.08 mmol), Pd/SX/MSA/1-dodecene
(1:4:40:110), α = 0.5, dodecane as the cosolvent (9 g), water
(12 g), Marlipal 24/XX as the surfactant, Na2SO4 (1 wt %), p(CO) = 30 bar, T =
85 °C, n = 1200 rpm, t = 20
h.

In summary, the series of experiments
confirms the assumption that the local concentrations of the reactants
at the oil–water interface are crucial for the reaction performance.
These concentrations are mainly determined by hydrophilicity and the
amount of surfactant. The EO number of the applied surfactant controls
the ability to perform as an emulsifier, which has a strong impact
on the local concentrations and thus on the reaction rate for hydroxycarbonylation
of 1-dodecene in microemulsion systems.

2.3 Variation
of Catalyst Concentration
According to Section 2.1, the formation of inactive
catalyst species depends on the local concentration of the catalyst
complex at the oil–water interface. To confirm the formation
of inactive catalyst species at the interface, experiments were carried
out with variation of the catalyst concentration whereby the interfacial
area was maintained using a constant surfactant concentration. Typically,
the reaction rate increases with increasing catalyst concentration,
often with a reaction order of 1.28 In
this case, the initial rate of hydroxycarbonylation increases in a
concentration range from 0 to 8 mmol/L of palladium as seen in Figure 10 but surprisingly
with a fractional reaction order of 1.8. Because the molar ratio of
palladium to SulfoXantPhos to MSA remains constant at 1:4:40, we assume
that the unexpected reaction order is caused by the increased concentration
of MSA in this concentration range. As a result, more acidic reaction
conditions are obtained with a higher amount of palladium, leading
to a disproportionately high formation of the active palladium hydride
species (see Figure 11) and thus to the unexpected reaction order of 1.8. Rodionova et
al. investigated methoxycarbonylation of cyclohexene and found similar
results for the reaction order of the used acid as the cocatalyst.31

Figure 10 Effect of Pd concentration on hydroxycarbonylation of
1-dodecene. Experimental conditions: Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 as the precursor, Pd/SX/MSA (1:4:40), α = 0.5,
1-dodecene (3 g), dodecane as the cosolvent (9 g), water (12 g), Marlipal
24/70 as the surfactant, γ = 9%, Na2SO4 (1 wt %), p(CO) = 30 bar, T =
85 °C, n = 1200 rpm, t = 20
h, VR = 0.03 L, initial rate calculated
from gas consumption at X = 5%.

Figure 11 Possible catalyst deactivation pathways.

A further increase of the palladium concentration leads to
a stagnation of the initial rate of reaction around 28 mmol/(L·h),
indicating a catalyst inhibition because of the formation of inactive
catalyst species (see Figure 11). We have to mention that variation of the stirrer speed
at the highest palladium concentration shows no impact on the initial
rate of hydroxycarbonylation, excluding any mass transport limitation.
On the one hand, it is well-known that homogeneous palladium catalysts
can form dimeric species, which are inactive for the palladium-catalyzed
hydroxycarbonylation of 1-dodecene.32−34 We assume that high
palladium and ligand concentrations lead to an enhanced formation
of the inactive dimeric species, suppressing a further increase of
the initial rate of hydroxycarbonylation. It has to be mentioned that
the molar ratio of palladium to SulfoXantPhos to MSA remains constant
at 1:4:40 for this experimental series. As a result, not only the
palladium concentration is increased at the interface, but also the
concentration of the ligand SulfoXantPhos, influencing the formation
of the dimeric catalyst species as well. On the other hand, Mecking
et al.35 identified a bimolecular decomposition
pathway for the active palladium hydride species forming palladium
black, hydrogen, and a fully coordinated (diphosphine)2Pd complex under reaction conditions. As a result of both deactivation
pathways, the amount of the active catalyst species may stagnate at
high concentrations of palladium, which would explain the observed
plateau of the initial rate of hydroxycarbonylation.

In addition,
the l/b regioselectivity and chemoselectivity of hydroxycarbonylation
remains unchanged. Merely, isomerization of 1-dodecene takes place,
which decreases chemoselectivity to 90%. As expected, the l/b regioselectivity
to the linear acid is at a constant value of 64%, which confirms that
an increase of the palladium concentration does not change the structure
of the active catalyst species for the hydroxycarbonylation of 1-dodecene.

2.4 Modification of the Nonpolar Phase
The
effect of cosolvents on the reaction performance and the phase behavior
has also been investigated. The idea behind these experiments is to
switch the phase behavior without changing the local concentrations
at the oil–water interface, which should lead to similar initial
reaction rates, thus verifying the previous results. As seen in Figure 12, the chain length
of alkane, which has been applied as the cosolvent, affects the temperature
slightly for existence of the three-phase region.

= 1:4:40:110, and mass ratio 1-dodecene to cosolvent = 1:3.

As expected, with increasing hydrophobicity
(chain-length) of the applied cosolvent, the phase boundaries are
shifted to higher temperatures. However, the impact of changing the
chain length on the phase behavior is rather low. The extension of
the chain length by two carbon atoms results in a shift of the three-phase
region of about 2 °C to higher temperatures. Furthermore, the
slight change of the phase behavior by changing the hydrophobicity
of the cosolvent shows no influence on the initial rate of hydroxycarbonylation
(Figure 13), indicating
no impact of the phase behavior on the reaction performance. Apparently,
the local concentrations of the reactants at the oil–water
interface do not differ for the applied alkanes as cosolvents despite
the slight change of the phase behavior. Both chemoselectivity and
l/b regioselectivity remain constant as well. The chemoselectivity
is in a range of 90–95% because of isomerization of 1-dodecene.
Nevertheless, the adjustment of the three-phase region by the choice
of the cosolvent is crucial for a subsequent recycling procedure and
product purification.

from gas consumption at X = 5%.

3 Conclusions
With this contribution,
the impact of nonionic surfactants on the palladium-catalyzed hydroxycarbonylation
of 1-dodecene in microemulsion systems was demonstrated. Special attention
was given to the interaction of the phase behavior of the microemulsion
system and the reaction performance. It was found that the phase behavior
does not control the reaction performance for catalysis in microemulsion
systems. In contrast, the amount and type of the nonionic surfactants
are crucial for catalysis in these reaction systems. First, the surfactant
provides the interfacial area between oil and water. Because of the
surface active properties of the applied catalyst complex, the reaction
takes place at the interface. Extending this interfacial area by increasing
the amount of surfactant, the reaction performance is substantially
improved. Second, the hydrophilicity of the surfactant determines
the local concentrations of substrates at the interface influencing
the rate of hydroxycarbonylation. The presented results confirm the
recently published results where the role of nonionic surfactants
in the rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of 1-dodecene was investigated.
Moreover, the concentration of the active catalyst complex at the
interface has a huge impact on the reaction performance of hydroxycarbonylation.
Dependent on its bulk concentration, inactive catalyst species are
formed reducing the reaction performance. Consequently, the amount
and chemical properties of the surfactant and the chemical behavior
of the applied catalyst complex are crucial parameters to optimize
the reaction performance for catalysis in microemulsion systems.

On the basis of these results, the transfer from the lab scale into
a continuously operated miniplant is currently under investigation.
Hereby, the phase separation in the decanter unit and the catalyst
stability is of special interest because of concentration shifts during
the continuously operated reaction. In general, the three-phase region
or the oil-in-water microemulsion is desirable to perform the recycling
of the catalyst and the separation of the product. However, the time
for phase separation is drastically reduced in the three-phase region,
facilitating lower residence time in the decanter and thus the three-phase
region of the microemulsion system is appropriate for recycling experiments.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals
The
substrates such as 1-dodecene (94%), decane (94%), and hexadecane
(99%) were purchased from Merck and the cosolvents such as dodecane
(98%) and octane (98%) were received from ABCR. Water was obtained
from VWR with the HPLC grade. Sigma-Aldrich has delivered the palladium
precursor Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 with a purity
of 99.9%, the cosolvent tetradecane (92%), and the cocatalyst MSAwith
a purity of 99.5%. SulfoXantPhos (CAS registry number 215792-51-1)
was used as a ligand and was synthesized by MOLISA following a procedure
described by Goedheijt et al.36 It is the
water-soluble analogue of the commercially available 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene
(XantPhos). Nonane (99%) from Sigma-Aldrich was used as the internal
standard. Carbon monoxide was obtained from Air Liquide with a purity
of 99.9%. The applied nonionic surfactants of the Marlipal series
were provided by Sasol Germany. It is worth to mention that the surfactants
are of technical grade with a certain chain length distribution. To
control the ionic strength of the reaction media, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) was used, which was purchased from Merck.
All chemicals were used as received without further purification.

4.2 Determination of the Phase Behavior
The
investigations on the phase behavior were performed in 10 mL Schlenk
tubes. The cosolvent (2.25 g), 1-dodecene (0.75 g), the surfactant
(Marlipal 24/XX), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), and
the cocatalyst MSA were weighted into the Schlenk tube and flushed
with argon. A stock solution of the precursor Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 and the ligand SulfoXantPhos was prepared in
water with standard Schlenk technique and stirred overnight. The catalyst
solution (3.0 g) was added to the Schlenk tube under an argon counterflow,
and the tubes were closed with a septum. Afterward, the Schlenk tubes
were placed into a water bath, and the phase behavior of the microemulsion
system was investigated in a temperature range between 50 and 90 °C
in 1 °C steps. For that, the temperature of the water bath was
adjusted as desired, and then the tubes were shaken and the phase
separation was observed after 10 min.

4.3 Experimental
Setup for Hydroxycarbonylation
All experiments were carried
out in a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave built by Halmosi GmbH. An
overview of the reactor setup is given in Figure 14. The autoclave (10) is equipped
with a gas dispersion stirrer, a baffle to ensure the dispersion of
the reaction mixture, and a PTFE inlay to avoid the formation of palladium
black at the inner surface of the reactor wall. To maintain isobaric
reaction conditions, a pressure transmitter (4) is connected
with a mass flow controller (3) to the reactor. For a
fast initial pressurization of the reactor with carbon monoxide, a
bypass was installed (6). Additionally, the autoclave
has connections for sampling (13), inertization (7a), and the injection of reactants (12) under
a nitrogen counterflow. A process control system monitors all process-values
and the corresponding set-values such as pressure, temperature, gas
flow, and stirring speed and records the data.

hydroxycarbonylation.

4.4 Experimental Procedure for Hydroxycarbonylation
In a typical experiment, the cosolvent, 1-dodecene as the substrate,
the surfactant, nonane as the internal standard (300 mg), and MSA
as the co-catalyst were weighted into the PTFE inlay and introduced
to the reactor. After evacuation and flushing the reactor with nitrogen
three times, the catalyst solution was injected with a syringe under
a nitrogen counterflow. The catalyst solution was prepared overnight,
weighting Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 (0.08 mmol,
0.5 equiv) and SulfoXantPhos (0.64 mmol, 4 equiv) into a Schlenk flask
using standard Schlenk technique and adding water (12 g) through a
septum. The reactor was heated up to the desired reaction temperature,
pressurized with carbon monoxide, and stirred at 1200 rpm. Samples
were taken at fixed time intervals, diluted with acetone, and centrifuged
to precipitate the ligand from the solution. Gas chromatography (GC)
analysis was performed on Shimadzu GC2010 Plus with a flame ionization
detector (FID) packed with the Restek RTX5-MS column (30 m ×
0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Nonane was used as the internal standard
to calculate the conversion of dodecene, yields of acid, chemoselectivity,
and linear-to-branched regioselectivity (l/b), expressed as the ratio
of linear acid to the sum of linear and branched acids, as shown in eqs 3–6. 3   4   5   6
