The design of green synthetic reaction conditions is
very challenging,
especially for biomaterials, but worthwhile if the compounds can be
easily synthesized in the aqueous medium. Herein, we report the development
of sunlight-mediated thiol–ene/yne click reaction in the presence
of a catalytic amount of tert-butyl hydroperoxide
(TBHP) in an aqueous medium. The optimized reaction conditions were
successfully applied to synthesize a series of small molecules and
lipids in a single step in the aqueous medium. The synthetic cationic
lipid/co-lipid formed positively charged stable nanosized liposomes
that effectually bind with the genetic materials. The in vitro DNA
transfection and cellular uptake assays showed that the synthesized
cationic lipids have comparable efficiency to commercially available
Lipofectamine 2000. This mild synthetic strategy can also be used
for smart design of novel or improvement of prevailing lipid-based
nonviral gene delivery systems. Such chemical transformations in the
aqueous medium are more environment-friendly than other reported thiol–ene/yne
click reactions performed in an organic solvent medium.

Introduction
Over the past 2 decades, numerous viral
or nonviral gene delivery
systems have been developed to fight against various life-threatening
diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular alignment, and others.
Clinical studies have shown that the modification of cells at the
genetic level significantly improves their therapeutic potentials.1,2 The recently developed CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome engineering technology
has extended the application of gene therapy to investigate the desirable
and undesirable cellular processes.3 Nucleic
acid delivery also provides a new perspective for the treatment of
tandem healing, antitumor T cell immunity, cancer vaccines, and others.1,3−6 However, a vehicle is required to encapsulate and transport the
negatively charged genetic materials across the hydrophobic lipid
bilayer for its successful delivery to the cells. Viral vectors-based
delivery systems have been widely used for the successful delivery
of genetic materials both under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Surprisingly,
the random integration of the viral gene delivery system into the
host genome interposes the target gene expression, which diminishes
their therapeutic potentials. In this regard, nonviral gene delivery
systems have been developed as an alternative approach.1,3−9

Among the nonviral gene delivery systems, the natural/synthetic
lipids are one of the most promising vehicles to optimize the delivery
of exogenous genetic materials.1,2,9,10 The lipids provide safeguard
to genetic materials and obtain improved bioavailability with reduced
immunogenicity and cytotoxicity. In particular, the cationic lipid-based
vehicles show tremendous applications because of their efficient lipoplexes
formation and membrane fusion capability.1,2,10,11 Since the
discovery of N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium
chloride (DOTMA) (a cationic lipid with ammonium headgroup and with
ether-linked hydrophobic tails), several lipids have been developed
to augment the delivery of genetic materials.1,2,5,7,9,12−15 Few cationic lipid-based gene delivery vehicles are also commercially
available (such as Lipofectamine 2000 and TransFast).16

A detailed structural investigation revealed that
the general structure
of the cationic lipids contains three crucial moieties, including
a hydrophilic headgroup, a linker, and hydrophobic tails. The presence
of ammonium moiety (or moieties) provides the required cationic charge
to the headgroup, which is a prerequisite for enhanced electrostatic
interactions with the phosphate backbone of the nucleic acids. The
hydrophobic tails in association with the polar headgroup self-assembled
in the aqueous medium to form liposomes capable of forming stable
lipoplexes.8,14,16−19 The linker region between the hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic
headgroup provides additional means for their interactions with water
and nucleic acids.20,21 Unfortunately, the gene delivery
efficacy of most of the reported cationic lipids is generally not
adequate for clinical and other in vivo applications and also has
shortcomings, including harsh reaction conditions with multistep synthetic
routes, structural complexity, low stability, low transfection efficiency,
and biocompatibility. Recent studies also demonstrated that the higher
numbers of cationic ammonium moieties in the headgroup region also
enhance their cytotoxic effect.1−3,7−11,14,16,17,21−24

Currently, scientists are more focused on to make chemical
bonds
by utilizing various sources of renewable energies. The green chemical
reactions, which take the benefits of plentiful, nonpolluting, and
inexpensive solvent and renewable energy sources, such as water and
sunlight, respectively, have been widely investigated for applications
in biological science, organic chemistry, material sciences, and other
related research areas.6,25−29 The click reaction is considered as one of the successful
green chemical reactions. The thiol–ene/yne click reaction
has emerged as a valuable tool to synthesize macromolecules like gels,
lipids, polymers, materials, and others. The synthesis of thioethers
is also advantageous due to the high abundance of sulfur-containing
natural products and bioactive molecules. The thiol–ene/yne
click chemistry is an attractive and atom-economical approach for
the construction of thioethers and is useful for efficient postpolymerization
modification. The thiol–ene/yne click reaction generally proceeds
either via thiol-Michael addition or via thermal/photochemical radical
pathways. In the radical pathways, a photoinitiator or thermal initiator
is essential to generate a radical and consequently produce the thiyl
radicals from thiol compounds via hydrogen abstraction. The thiyl
radical has the aptitude to couple with an alkene/alkyne.4,6,23,29−31

Although the thiyl radical-mediated hydrothiolation
process is
very proficient and tolerant of various functional groups, it requires
a photoinitiator or thermal initiators.4 Besides, most of the reported thiol–ene/yne click chemistry
approaches suffer from harsh reaction conditions with the possible
formation of disulfides as byproducts, which restricts its applications
to only simple systems.4,31,32 The thermal initiation reactions require a comparatively high temperature
and longer time to accomplish the full conversion of the alkene/alkynes.
The use of metal catalysts like Ru(II) complexes for the thiol–ene/yne
click reaction offers excellent potential with higher stereo- and
regioselectivity.33 The UV/sunlight-mediated
thiol–ene/yne click reaction in the presence of dyes like eosin-Y
has also attracted widespread current research interest due to the
green and sustainable process of syntheses.25,34,35 Recent developments of photoredox catalysts
have offered an attractive approach to generate thiyl radical in complex
systems. However, most of these photoinduced reactions require expensive
photosensitive catalysts to utilize the visible light in sensitizing
the organic molecules.4,6,25−28,33,34,36,37 The use of
expensive photoinitiators limits the applicability of these photochemical
reactions in large-scale production of the synthetic materials.30,37 Recently, it has been demonstrated that the thiols could be easily
converted to thiyl radicals under sunlight at ambient temperature
and this thiyl radical can undergo “click” reactions
with alkene or alkyne.25,29,31 Most importantly, the reported thiol–ene/yne click reactions
are limited to organic solvents [like N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), CH2Cl2, dioxane,
and tetrahydrofuran (THF)] because of the poor stability of the thiyl
radicals in the aqueous medium.4,31−33,38 Because of the environmental
concerns, the chemical reactions in the aqueous phase are much more
superior to organic solvents. Synthesis of thioethers via thiol–ene/yne
click reaction in aqueous medium continuously provides new challenges
as well as prospects for chemists; also, there has been an increasing
demand for green synthetic routes for the synthesis of organosulfur
compounds in the development of drugs and materials application. The
synthesis of materials, including polymers in the aqueous medium,
is also useful in manufacturing cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, water
purifications, oil separation, and others. We hypothesize that if
thiyl radicals can be generated in situ in the aqueous medium, then
the applications of thiol–ene/yne click chemistry will be manifold.

Herein, sunlight-mediated thiol–ene/yne click reaction in
the presence of a catalytic amount of tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (TBHP) in the aqueous medium was demonstrated. The optimized
reaction conditions have been proven to be efficient and powerful
for the synthesis of small molecules of chemical and pharmaceutical
interest. This synthetic methodology was also applied to prepare a
series of modular lipid molecules with neutral, zwitterionic, and
cationic headgroups. The synthesized lipids form stable liposomes
in the aqueous medium and possess several favorable physicochemical
properties of lipids. Notably, these synthetic cationic lipids showed
stronger DNA binding affinity and efficient DNA transfection ability
with low cytotoxicity in different cell lines. Overall, this sunlight-mediated
thiol–ene/yne click reaction is highly beneficial to synthesize
small and complex molecules in the aqueous medium.

Results and Discussion
Optimization of the Reaction Conditions for the Thiol–Yne
Click Reactions under Aqueous Environment
We started with
mild reaction conditions to perform the thiol–ene/yne click
reaction in an aqueous medium. The thiyl radicals are known to undergo
click reactions with alkenes or alkynes in the absence or presence
of radical initiators under an organic solvent.4 However, the formation of thiyl radicals in the aqueous
medium is challenging. Hence, our first target was to generate thiyl
radicals in the aqueous medium. We started our investigation with
the model reaction of propargyl alcohol and dodecanthiol under sunlight
in various reaction conditions, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) is a water-soluble, inexpensive radical
initiator and known to form t-BuO• or t-BuOO• radicals in the aqueous
medium.39 The oxidation of thiol by t-BuO• or t-BuOO• radicals could generate the thiyl radicals that can
react with alkene/alkyne to produce the thioethers. To our delight,
a catalytic amount of TBHP (0.05 mol %) as the radical initiator and
H2O as the solvent (Table 1, entry 17) led to the formation of the hydrothiolated
product with the highest yields. Interestingly, redox additives, including
Fe2+/Fe3+ and Cu+/Cu2+, adversely affected the model reaction with lower yields. The use
of H2O2 and di-tert-butyl peroxide
(DTBP) failed to produce the targeted product. Solvent screenings
revealed that H2O or H2O/DMF (1:0.01) was producing
very similar results to those in the presence of organic solvents
(Table 1, entries 12–14
and 17). Therefore, to develop mild reaction conditions, a H2O or H2O/DMF solvent mixture was used. The reaction was
also successfully performed in the presence of UV light (λex = 365 nm), suggesting that in the absence of sunlight, the
reaction can also be performed. Additionally, the reaction under dark
conditions produces the targeted compound with a very low yield, which
indicates that the light is necessary for the reaction. Moreover,
a control reaction in the presence of (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl
(TEMPO) drastically reduced the reaction yield (Table 1, entry 20), which confirms that the reactions
proceed through the radical pathway under the aqueous environment.
The thiols and alkenes/alkynes are generally unreactive toward each
other. However, various initiators can initiate their reactions. We
hypothesized that the coupling of thiols with alkyne proceeds via
a radical reaction pathway, and the TBHP acts as a thiyl radical initiator
under aqueous medium. The exposure of sunlight initiates the cleavage
of TBHP into tert-butoxyl and hydroxyl radicals.39 Subsequently, the tert-butoxyl
radical converts the thiols into thiyl radicals, and these thiyl radicals
undergo coupling reaction with alkynes to produce the corresponding
hydrothiolated product. The formation of tert-butoxyl
and hydroxyl radicals under the optimized reaction conditions was
confirmed by the high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis
of the reaction mixture (Figure S1). Based
on these experimental outcomes and control experiments, a proposed
mechanism for this TBHP-initiated thiol–ene/yne click reaction
is demonstrated in Figure 1.

Synthesis of Small Molecules and Cationic Lipids
With
the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we explored differently
substituted alkenes and alkynes with various thiols for the application
of this thiol–ene/yne click reaction under aqueous medium (Table 2). The reaction of
aliphatic alkynes with thiols showed bis-hydrothiolation reactions
with an excellent yield of 89–92% (compounds 3a–c). However, the anti-Markovnikov selective
thiol–yne click reaction showed a monohydrothiolated product
from aromatic alkynes (compounds 3d–f). The aliphatic and aromatic alkenes also showed excellent hydrothiolation
reactions under the optimized reaction conditions (compounds 5a–g).

of Thioethers via Thiol–Yne/Ene Click Reactionsa
a The reactions were performed using
0.046 mmol 2 or 4 and 1 mmol 1 in the presence of 0.05 mmol TBHP; the reactions for compounds 3a–c were performed in H2O
(2 mL); and the reactions for compounds 3d–f and 5a–g were performed in H2O/DMF (2 mL) solvent mixture
(1:0.01, v/v).

We also synthesized a series of lipids using the thiol–ene/yne
click reaction under the optimized reaction conditions. We synthesized
three different types of lipids with cationic, zwitterionic, and neutral
headgroups.31,40,41 The headgroups of lipid molecules were synthesized from a common
starting molecule 2-((prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)methyl)oxirane (Scheme S1). The reaction of 2-((prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)methyl)oxirane
(6) with the mono-/di-alkyl amine, followed by methylation
of amine, resulted in the headgroup of the lipid molecules. The reaction
of dimethylamine with 2-((prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)methyl)oxirane (6) resulted in alkynyl derivative 1-(dimethylamino)-3-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)propan-2-ol
(7), which upon reaction with iodomethane and 2-bromoacetic
acid yielded alkynyl derivatives 8 and 9, respectively. The reaction of compound 6 with 2,2′-azanediyldiethanol,
followed by methylation, resulted in alkynyl derivative 11. The reaction of compound 6 with tert-butyl (2-aminoethyl)carbamate, followed by methylation and removal
of the Boc group, produced the alkynyl derivative 14 (Scheme S1). After that, the reactions between
these alkynyl headgroups with long-chain alkyl thiols were performed
by using our optimized reaction conditions. The reactions of alkyl
thiols of different chain lengths (C12 and C16) with alkynyl derivatives
produced the lipids 15–19 (Figure 2 and Table 2). We also synthesized the control
compound 20a (without the β-hydroxy group in the
linker region) under similar reaction conditions (Table 2). The alkyl thioethers of the
synthesized lipids are analogous to the two acyl chains present in
the natural phospholipids. One of the significant challenges in the
synthesis of most of the cationic lipids using the conventional chemistries
is the typical obligation of protection and deprotection for the installation
of acyl or ether linkage containing headgroups. Interestingly, the
thiol–yne reaction produced the thioether-based lipids in the
absence of protecting groups, suggesting that the presence of free
acid, amine, and hydroxyl groups did not appear to obstruct the formation
of lipids. The higher chemoselectivity of the thiol–yne reaction
could be one of the reasons for the efficient synthesis of these lipids.41 It is important to mention that for the synthesis
of compounds 15–20, the H2O/DMF solvent mixture (1:0.01) was used to increase the solubility
of dodecanethiol or hexadecanethiol. However, the reaction may also
proceed at the interface of the aqueous medium. Overall, we successfully
synthesized a series of lipids using an inexpensive and environment-friendly
approach.

thiol–yne clicks reactions in the aqueous medium. The reactions
were performed using 0.46 mmol 7–11 (1 equiv) and 1.0 mmol
RSH (2.2 equiv) in the presence of 0.05 mmol TBHP in 2 mL of H2O/DMF (1:0.01, v/v) under sunlight.

Physicochemical Properties of the Cationic lipids
We
observed that hydration of the thin films of the lipids forms stable
aggregates in aqueous solution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
analyses were performed to investigate the aggregation pattern of
the lipids in an aqueous medium.16,42−45 The TEM images revealed the formation of small and medium-sized
liposomes (200–450 nm) by these lipids (Figure 3). We characterized the physicochemical properties
such as particle size, surface potential, phase-transition temperature,
and DNA-binding properties of the lipids. The dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements also showed the formation of vesicles in an aqueous
medium with a very similar hydrodynamic diameter and narrow size distribution
(Figure 4A). The hydrodynamic
diameters of the liposomes obtained by the DLS measurements of the
lipids were found to be within 200–450 nm.42,43 The lipids with shorter chain length formed liposomes with smaller
sizes. We also examined the effect of pH on the hydrodynamic diameter
and surface charge of the lipids. The DLS measurements showed that
the pH of the environment has little impact on the hydrodynamic diameter
of the lipids 16a and 19a (Figure 4B).16,42,43 However, the pH of the environment plays
a vital role in the surface charge of the lipids, which could be due
to the presence of ammonium ion in the lipid headgroup (Figure 4C). The intramolecular ionic
interaction could be one of the reasons for the deprotonation of secondary
alcohol around pH 8.0. The isoelectric points (IEPs) of the lipids 16a and 19a were 8.19 and 8.09, respectively.
The IEP values also demonstrate that these lipids are generally cationic
under physiological conditions.

100% lipids of 15–19a (A–E)
and 15–19b (F–J). For lipids 15–19a and 15–19b, the chain lengths were C12 and C16.

at room temperature. Temperature-dependent steady-state fluorescence
anisotropy measurements of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) under
the vesicle environment for 16a and 19a lipids
within the range of 10–80 °C (D). The inset shows the Tm values of the lipids.

Fluidity and the transition from the gel phase
to the liquid disordered
phase are essential parameters of the lipids. Hence, the phase-transition
temperature (Tm) of the cationic lipids
can be considered as a fundamental physical property to investigate
the thermal stability and gene delivery properties of the liposomes.42,43 We performed temperature-dependent steady-state anisotropy measurements
using the membrane-embedded 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) fluorescence
probe to determine the Tm values of the
lipids (Figure 4D).
The observed Tm values of lipids 16a and 19a were 43 and 37 °C, respectively.
This elevation of Tm values could be due
to the more ordered packing in the plane of the lipid bilayer.42,43 This moderate thermal stability also suggests that these lipids
could have multiple biological applicability. We also assume that
in the presence of fusogenic co-lipid such as 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE), the liposomes would
also be stable.

Interaction of the Lipids with the Plasmid DNA
The
liposomes of these synthetic lipids were prepared in combination with
co-lipid PE (1:1 mole ratio). The inverted hexagonal structure of
PE lipid is known to facilitate the endosomal membrane fusion and
facile release of DNA, leading to higher transfection efficiencies
of the lipoplexes.8,16,31 The DNA-binding capability is the prerequisite for gene delivery
vectors, and the optimum balance between the DNA binding and release
is imperative to enhance transfection efficiency. The DNA binding
ability of these liposomes was investigated by electrophoretic gel
retardation assay. The green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged plasmid
DNA of the MMP7 enzyme (pMMP7-GFP) was used for all gene delivery-related
studies. Efficient gene delivery vehicles should bind plasmid DNA
at low N/P ratios. The outcome of the gel retardation studies showed
that both hydrophobic chain length and overall charge of the headgroup
have a variable effect on their DNA-binding ability (Figure 5). The mobility of the plasmid
DNA was strongly inhibited in the presence of the lipids with monocationic
headgroups (16 and 19) at the N/P ratios
of 1–2. The lipids with zwitterionic headgroup (18) failed to retard the plasmid DNA up to the N/P ratio of 8, indicating
their weaker DNA binding ability. The cationic and polyamine-containing
lipids are known to have stronger DNA-binding ability.9,16,24 Surprisingly, the lipid 17 with ammonium and trialkylammonium headgroups showed lower
plasmid DNA-binding ability (N/P ratio ≥2), suggesting that
the presence of the β-hydroxy group in the linker region plays
a vital role in their DNA-binding abilities. The hydroxy group may
interact with the terminal ammonium group of lipid 12, leading to its inaccessibility for DNA binding.15 We also synthesized lipid (20a) without the
β-hydroxy group-containing linker region. The gel retardation
studies showed a much weaker DNA-binding ability (even N/P > 4)
of
lipid 20a, suggesting the importance of the β-hydroxy
group in DNA binding (Figures S2 and S3). Overall, the cationic lipids showed stronger DNA-binding abilities
with C12 in comparison to that of C16 chain length, suggesting that
the length of the hydrophobic alkyl group is also a key parameter
in stable lipoplex formation. Hence, the plasmid DNA-binding affinity
of the synthesized lipids follows an order of 19a ≈ 16a ≈ 16b > 19b ≈ 17a > 15a > 15b ≈ 17b ≈ 18a ≈ 18b, suggesting
that the DNA-binding affinity of the lipids can be tuned by choosing
certain types of headgroup and hydrophobic tails. For cellular applications,
the lipoplexes should be stable enough to evade possible detachment
under the physiological conditions before they reach the targeting
tissues. In this regard, the DNA-binding ability of the potent cationic
lipids 16 and 19 was investigated in the
presence of serum.16 The gel retardation
assay showed that these cationic lipids also effectively inhibited
the mobility of plasmid DNA at N/P ratio of 2–4 in the presence
of both 10 and 50% serum, suggesting that the presence of serum has
a minimal effect on their DNA-binding abilities (Figure S4). The time-dependent studies showed no release or
enzymolysis of DNA even after 2 h, suggesting the stability of the
lipoplexes in the presence of serum (Figure S4). It is important to mention that the appearance of one or two bands
with different brightnesses in the gel images could be due to the
change in the structure of the DNA after the formation of the lipoplexes.

and presence of co-liposomes at different N/P ratios (0–8).
The lipids of C12 (A–E) and C16 (F−J) chain lengths
and PE were used to measure their DNA-binding abilities by gel electrophoresis
assay. The molar ratio of synthetic lipid and PE was 1:1 (mole ratio).
All of the gel electrophoresis measurements were performed in triplicates.

Relation between the Particle Size and Surface Charge of the
Lipoplexes
The gene transfection efficiency greatly depends
on the size and surface charge of the lipoplexes, which depends on
the structural properties of headgroup and hydrophobic tails. In this
regard, the hydrodynamic diameter and surface charge of the lipoplexes
were investigated. The outcome of the DLS measurements showed that
the average dH’s of the liposomes
and lipoplexes were within 200–500 nm (Figure 6A,C). The variable sizes of the liposomes
suggest that the hydrophilic properties of the headgroup played an
essential role in the liposome formation. The lipids with shorter
chain lengths could produce lipoplexes with a small size. The liposomes
of 16, 17, and 19 have a positive
surface charge, which facilitates their electrostatic interaction
with the negatively charged DNA. The lipids 15 and 18 formed negatively charged liposomes under physiological
conditions. Meanwhile, different surface charges were observed for
the lipoplexes at various N/P ratios (Figure 6B,D). The lipoplexes of 16, 17, and 19 demonstrated a rapid increase in the
surface charge when the N/P ratios were varied from 0.5 to 8. The
lipoplexes of 16 and 19 have a cationic
surface potential, and average dH values
were less than 400 nm at an N/P ratio of 2, at which full retardation
of DNA was observed in the gel electrophoresis assay. The hydrophobic
chain length had no substantial effect on both size and surface charge
of the lipoplexes. The lipoplex of 15 showed a slower
increases in surface charge, but the lipoplex of 18 showed
a decrease in surface charge within the same range of N/P ratios,
suggesting that the surface charge could be tuned by selection of
a particular lipid structure. The outcome of the size and surface
charge measurements suggests that the lipoplexes might possess a different
cellular gene transfection efficiency. The TEM analysis was also performed
to investigate the morphologies of the lipoplexes at an N/P ratio
of 2 (Figures S5 and S6). The TEM images
showed that both the lipids could adequately encapsulate the DNA.
However, the size of the lipoplexes obtained from the TEM images of 16 and 19 (50–200 nm) are much smaller
than that measured by DLS analysis (200–400 nm), which could
be due to the shrinking of lipoplexes in the drying process during
the TEM sample preparation, while the DLS measures the hydrodynamic
sizes in the aqueous solution. The lipoplexes formed from lipid 16a showed a larger size than other lipids.16

Figure 6 Mean particle size (A, C) and surface potential (B, D) of the lipoplexes
at different N/P ratios. The lipids of C12 (A, B) and C16 (C, D) chain
lengths were used to measure the particle size and surface potential
of the corresponding lipoplexes. DLS measurements were performed at
room temperature. The molar ratio of synthetic lipid and PE was 1:1.

Gene Transfection Efficiency of the Lipoplexes
The
cytotoxicity of the lipids was analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293T) and
baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21) cell lines.31 The lipids 16a, 17a, and 19a were selected for investigating their applicability because
of their higher DNA-binding abilities. The MTT results showed that
the IC50 values of the lipids were within 106–165
and 80–144 μM for HEK-293T and BHK-21 cell lines, respectively
(Figure S5 and Table S1). Overall, the
IC50 values indicate the low toxicity of these lipids,
which is useful for their successful application as a nonviral gene
delivery system.

The outcome of the gel retardation assay and
the formation of stable lipoplex suggest that the synthesized cationic
lipids have the potential to deliver the genetic material to cells.
Hence, in vitro gene transfection efficiencies of the lipids were
investigated by fluorescence microscopy assay in HEK-293T cells using
pMMP7-GFP plasmid DNA encoding the GFP-tagged MMP7 enzyme. It is well
documented that fusogenic lipid-like PE is usually required for effective
transfection by the cationic lipids.16,23,31 The synthetic lipids 16a, 17a, and 19a showed strong DNA-binding abilities (with
N/P ratio >2) among all of the tested lipids. In this regard, the
cellular assays were performed using only these potent lipids. The
liposomes were prepared in combination with co-lipid PE (1:1 mole
ratio). The liposomes with helper lipid-like PE show higher transfection
and lower cytotoxicity than those without PE.16,46 The lipoplexes were prepared at an N/P ratio of 2–8 using
pMMP7-GFP DNA as the reporter gene, and Lipofectamine 2000 was used
as the positive control (Figures 7 and S7). The cellular expression
of GFP protein was monitored to measure the transfection efficiency
of the lipids. The outcome of the gene transfection experiment revealed
that lipids 16a, 17a, and 19a (at an N/P ratio of 1–4) had a comparable transfection efficiency
to the commercially available Lipofectamine 2000 (Figures S8 and S9). The lipids with C16 chain lengths showed
comparatively weak DNA-binding efficiencies. Hence, the transfection
efficacies of those lipids were not investigated. The presence of
unsaturated hydrophobic tails causes weak intermolecular hydrophobic
interactions, leading to the formation of less stable liposomes, which
generally does not have any significant effect on the DNA binding
and delivery efficacies; hence, those classes of lipids were also
not investigated.16,42,43 The final concentrations of the lipids used for the delivery of
pMMP7-GFP DNA were within 15–120 nM (for N/P ratios 1–8),
which are much lower than their IC50 values (106–165
μM; obtained from the MTT assay). Hence, the toxicity of these
lipids could have a negligible impact on their gene transfection efficiencies.

microscopy images of the MMP7-GFP expression in HEK-293T
at various N/P ratios. Scale bar: 100 μm. Lipofectamine 2000
was used as control. Images were recorded using an inverted fluorescence
microscope.

We also evaluated the cellular uptake of pMMP7-GFP
in HEK-293T
cells at different N/P ratios. The internalization of the lipoplexes
significantly influences the transfection efficiency of the lipids.
We performed the flow cytometry assay to investigate the cellular
uptake of the DNA.16 After transfection,
the percentage of cells positive for GFP-labeled pMMP7 was calculated
and is shown in Figures 8, S10, and S11. For fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analyses, experiments were performed using the
FL1 channel for green fluorescence, and the data were analyzed using
FCS Express 6 Flow Cytometry software. The autofluorescence was detected
using nontransfected cells as control indicated as a peak in the histogram
plot using the FL1 channel. The M1 region is indicated in plots capturing
green fluorescence intensity in transfected cells, which is more than
autofluorescence intensity. The percentages of GFP positive cells
were calculated to measure the cellular uptake properties of the lipids.
The outcome of the flow cytometry analysis showed that there was only
a little difference between 16a, 19a (N/P
= 2 and 4), and Lipofectamine 2000, indicating that the lipoplexes
of these synthetic lipids have comparable intracellular delivery ability.
The cellular uptake efficiencies of lipids 16a and 19a were higher than that of 17a, which is in
good agreement with their DNA-binding and transfection efficiencies.
However, the transfection efficiencies of all of the tested lipids
decrease with N/P ratio >4. A similar consequence was observed
for
their DNA transfection efficiencies, suggesting that very high positive
surface potentials limit their transfection abilities in healthy HEK-293T
cells. The outer membrane of the normal healthy cells is generally
zwitterionic because of the high abundance of zwitterionic lipids
like phosphatidylcholine and others.47 We
are currently performing comprehensive transfection mechanism studies
of such types of lipids in different cell lines.

uptake efficiencies were quantified by flow cytometry analysis.

Conclusions
The sunlight-mediated synthetic reaction
conditions in the aqueous
medium have been developed to synthesize a series of small molecules
and lipids. The thiol–yne/ene click reaction was performed
in the aqueous medium in the presence of a catalytic amount of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) with a very high hydrothiolation
efficiency. The biophysical properties of the lipids, such as particle
size, surface potential, phase-transition temperature, and DNA-binding
ability, were thoroughly investigated. Most importantly, all of these
phosphorous-free lipids form stable vesicles, but only the cationic
lipids form stable lipoplexes. The structure-based DNA-binding studies
of the lipids revealed that the presence of the β-hydroxy group
in the linker region plays a vital role in forming stable lipoplexes.
Additional studies also revealed that the hydrophobic chain length
significantly affects the DNA-binding abilities of the lipids, and
C12 was found to be more suitable than C16 chain length. The potent
cationic lipids displayed much lower cytotoxicity. Interestingly,
these cationic lipids also showed comparable gene transfection and
cellular uptake properties with the commercially available Lipofectamine
2000, signifying their prospective to be favorable nonviral gene vectors.
Therefore, the design and synthesis of such sunlight-driven cationic
lipids may be a promising approach for lipid-based gene delivery systems.
However, further optimization of the lipid structure to improve the
gene delivery activities is required to establish their in vivo applications.
Overall, such mild reaction conditions can be applied for the smart
design of new or improvement of existing lipid-based gene delivery
systems. This synthetic strategy can also be used to synthesize other
small or macromolecules for pharmaceutical materials and others in
the aqueous medium.

Experimental Section
General Information
All reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Himedia, and used directly without further purification.
Column chromatography was performed using 60–120 mesh silica
gels. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
on silica gel 60 F254 (0.25 mm). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively,
with a Varian AS400 spectrometer and 600 and 151 MHz with Brucker
spectrometers, using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard
with CDCl3, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6. The coupling constants (J values)
and chemical shifts (δppm) were reported in hertz
(Hz) and parts per million (ppm), respectively, downfield from tetramethylsilane
using residual chloroform (d = 7.24 for 1H NMR, d = 77.23 for 13C NMR) as an internal
standard. Multiplicities are reported as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), m (multiplet), and br (broadened). High-resolution mass
spectroscopy (HRMS) images were recorded on an Agilent Q-TOF mass
spectrometer with Z-spray source using built-in software
for analysis of the recorded data. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE) was purchased from Avanti Polar
Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Ultrapure water (Milli-Q system, Millipore,
Billerica, MA) was used for the preparation of buffers.

then exposed to sunlight (weather condition: sunny, temperature, 30–36
°C) and kept for 30 min. After completion of the reaction, the
mixture was diluted with cold water and ethyl acetate. The organic

Preparation of Liposomes
The liposomes were prepared
by the thin-film hydration method in Milli-Q water. The synthesized
lipids [stock solution of chloroform/methanol at 8:2 (v/v)] were mixed
with PE [stock solution of chloroform/methanol at 8:2 (v/v)] with
a mole ratio of 1:1 in a glass vial and dried under reduced pressure
for 6 h to formulate the lipid thin film. The PE lipid was used as
the helper lipid. After that, the thin film was hydrated with Milli-Q
water overnight at 55 °C (final concentration of the liposome
was 1 mM), and the solution was vortexed for 15 min. Finally, the
solution was sonicated for 10 times (30 s of sonication followed by
30 s of cooling on ice) until the thin film disappeared.42,43

Transmission Electron Microscopy
For transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) imaging, vesicles were prepared by the method described
above in 25 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer, pH 7.4, containing
100 mM KCl.42,43 The prepared vesicles (no extrusion
method was used) were diluted to half of its original concentration
using HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Onto a carbon-coated copper grid, a 10
μL solution of liposome was placed from the diluted solution
and allowed to absorb for 1 min. After that, the grid was carefully
blotted with filter paper, keeping only a trace amount of the solution
in the middle of the grid. Then, the grid was allowed to dry for 10
min at 30 °C. Finally, 5–10 μL of 1% uranyl acetate
solution (in water) was added to the grid and allowed to dry for another
1 min. The excess uranyl acetate solution was wicked off, and the
grid was dried overnight at 30 °C. The images of the vesicles
formed on the carbon-coated copper grid were collected using a JEOL
JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope (operated at a maximum accelerating
voltage of 200 kV).

Particle Size and Surface Change of the Lipoplexes
The particle size and surface potential of free liposomes and lipoplex
(at various N/P ratios) were characterized by using dynamic light
scattering (DLS) and ζ potential measurements (Zetasizer Nano
ZS90, Malvern, Westborough, MA), respectively, at 25 °C.42,43

Isoelectric Point Measurements
For the estimation of
the isoelectric point (IEP) of the synthesized lipids, the surface
potential of lipid was measured in various pH solutions. The liposomes
were prepared according to the previously discussed thin-film hydration
method, using 5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer,
pH 8.6, containing 5 mM NaCl. For the ζ measurements, isosmotic
buffers consisting of 10 mM buffering agent and 10 mM salt at different
pH values ranging from 3.0 to 9.0 were freshly prepared. The buffers
with the pH range of 3.0–6.5 were prepared using citric acid
and trisodium citrate. 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid (MOPS) was used for buffer with pH 7.0, and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris)–HCl was used to prepare buffer with pH values in the
range of 7.5–9.0. Disposable capillary cells (DTS1061) and
fluorescence cuvettes were used for ζ potential and DLS measurements.
All of the analyses were performed at least three times per sample,
and the corresponding polydispersity indexes (PDIs) were within 0.1–0.4.

Lipid Phase-Transition Temperature Measurements
To
establish the phase-transition temperature (Tm) from the ordered gel to liquid disordered phase of the lipid
bilayers, temperature-dependent steady-state anisotropy measurements
were performed.42,43 For this purpose, environment-susceptible
fluorescence probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was used. Vesicles
were prepared using a similar method described in the previous section
(the hydration was performed by using 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4,
containing 100 mM KCl). A handheld mini-extruder with a polycarbonate
membrane (diameter of 100 nm) was used to prepare large unilamellar
vesicles. Consequently, to the extruded vesicles (800 μL), 8
μL of 1 mM DPH solution in THF was added (final concentration
of DPH was 10 μM; DPH <1% v/v in vesicle solution). Under
tumbling condition at room temperature overnight, this liposomal solution
was set aside for maximum incorporation of the DPH molecule inside
the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. The steady-state fluorescence
anisotropy measurements were performed with a refrigerated system
using a Peltier temperature controller connected to a Fluoromax-4
spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific). At the peak of the fluorescence
spectrum, where IVV and IVH are the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light
polarized parallel and perpendicular to the excited light, respectively,
and G = IVH/IHH is the instrumental grating factor, the degree of anisotropy
(r) in the DPH fluorescence (λex = 350 nm; λem = 429 nm) was calculated. All anisotropy
values of the DPH probe are the mean values of three individual determinations,
before and after the anisotropy measurements [anisotropy (r) = (IVV – GIVH)/ (IVV + 2GIVH)]. To explore the Tm values
of the lipids, plots of the degree of anisotropy (r) of the DPH probe as a function of temperature were studied.

Preparation of Lipoplexes
An assorted amount of liposomes
(containing synthesized lipid and PE with a mole ratio of 1:1) was
mixed with a constant amount of DNA by pipetting meticulously at a
variety of N/P ratios (from 0 to 8), and the mixture was incubated
at 30 °C for 30 min to prepare the lipid–DNA complex (lipoplex).8,10,16,22 The theoretical N/P ratio corresponded to the charge ratio of N
atoms on cationic lipid to nucleotide phosphates (in mole) and was
calculated by considering the average nucleotide mass.

Gel Retardation Assay
Gel retardation assay is widely
used to investigate the formation of liposome/pDNA complex (lipoplex).8,10,16,22 The stability of lipoplexes of different N/P ratios (ranging from
0 to 8) was measured, as mentioned in the previous section. For this
study, a fixed amount of pDNA was used (0.125 μg) and also a
fixed amount of each lipoplex solution (20 μL) was electrophoresed
on the 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel containing 1 μM ethidium bromide
and Tris-acetate (TAE) running buffer at 100 V for 30 min. The pDNA
was visualized with a UV lamp using a BioRad Universal Hood. The gel
retardation assay in the presence of serum was also performed following
similar experimental methods. The lipoplex solution (20 μL;
containing 10 or 50% serum) was obtained by adding Tris–HCl
buffer and serum (2 or 10 μL) and incubating for a specific
time.

Cytotoxicity Assays
The HEK-293T cells were seeded
in 96-well plates to get 70% confluency after 12 h incubation at 37
°C. Different concentrations of the compound were prepared in
plain Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and
added to the cells directly after a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
wash. The MTT solution was prepared at 5 mg/mL in PBS and filtered
through a 0.2 μm filter. After 24 h, 100 μL of 10% diluted
MTT in plain DMEM was added in each well. Cells were incubated for
4 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 95% air, and complete humidity.
After 4 h, the MTT solution was removed and replaced with 100 μL
of DMSO. The plate was further incubated for 15 min in the dark at
room temperature. The optical density (OD) of the wells was determined
using a Multiscan Go plate reader at a test wavelength of 570 nm and
a reference wavelength of 630 nm.

Measurement of Transfection Efficiency
To check the
transfection efficiency of the potent lipids, we used HEK-293T cells.
The HEK-293T cells were seeded in 12-well plates with a density of
0.1 × 106 per well, containing DMEM and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), and the plates were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C.
For the transfection experiment, first, pMMP7-GFP plasmid (1.5 μg)
and Opti-MEM media were added in a microfuge tube, and the final volume
was adjusted to 150 μL. In another centrifuge tube, lipoplex
of different N/P ratios and Opti-MEM media were added, and the final
volume was adjusted to 150 μL. Then, the microfuge tubes were
incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After that, the solutions were
mixed and kept at room temperature for 30 min. Before transfection,
the media of 12-well plates was removed and the cells were washed
with PBS. Then, the media containing lipoplex (300 μL) was added
in each well and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After
that, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with 2% FBS and incubated
for another 24 h. Finally, the transfected cells were analyzed to
measure GFP fluorescence-labeled cells after 24 h, under 40×
magnifications with a green filter using Floid imaging system. Lipofectamine
2000 was used as the positive control to measure the transfection
efficiency. For all of the measurements, 0.2 μL of Lipofectamine
2000 from the commercially available stock was used as control (as
no concentration was provided by the commercial source).

GFP-Uptake Assays
The HEK-293T cells were seeded in
six-well plates (density 0.3 × 106 per well in DMEM
containing 10% FBS). The plates were then incubated overnight at 37
°C. For transfection, the pMMP7-GFP (2.0 μg) and Opti-MEM
solution were added to make the final volume of 150 μL in a
centrifuge tube. In a separate tube, the lipoplex (at different N/P
ratios) and Opti-MEM media (to make the final volume of 150 μL)
were added. Then, both the tubes were incubated for 5 min at room
temperature. The solutions were mixed and kept at room temperature
for 30 min. The wells of the plate were washed with PBS. Then, media
containing lipoplex (300 μL) were added in each well and the
cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After that, the medium
was replaced with fresh DMEM with 2% FBS and incubated for another
24 h. For FACS analyses, experiments were performed on BD FACSCalibur
using the FL1 channel for green fluorescence. Data analyses were done
through FCS Express 6 Flow Cytometry software. Autofluorescence was
detected using nontransfected cells as control, indicated as a peak
in the histogram plot using FL1 channel. The M1 region is shown in
plots capturing green fluorescence intensity in transfected cells,
which is higher than autofluorescence intensity. Approximately 10 000
events were statistically evaluated for each sample in the histogram.
