Calcium hydroxide is used in diverse applications including
heritage
conservation where supplying it in the form of nanoparticles allows
easy carbonation with atmospheric air contacts. The effects of cellulose
nanofibers on the precipitation of calcium hydroxide nanoparticles
were investigated by varying the reaction time, concentration, and
carboxylation content of cellulose nanofibers. Cellulose nanofibers
were very effective in producing calcium hydroxide nanoparticles with
less than 50 nm sizes out of calcium nitrate–sodium hydroxide
precipitation reactions. The formation of smaller-size calcium hydroxide
nanoparticles is believed to be the result of heterogeneous nucleation
and growth of calcium hydroxide particles on cellulose nanofibers.
The liquid-phase nucleated and grown calcium hydroxide nanoparticles
were also deposited onto cellulose nanofibers. The resulting calcium
hydroxide nanoparticles were carbonized and generated calcite under
atmospheric carbon dioxide in an efficient way.

Introduction
Calcium compounds including calcium hydroxide
are used in diverse
applications where supplying them in the form of nanosized particles
brings unique advantages in their respective applications. Calcium
hydroxide is not only an important component of Portland cement but
is also used in the conservation of cultural heritage buildings, dental
materials, inhibition of ink corrosion of printed papers, and deacidification
of wood products.1−5 In the case of conservation and repair of building materials, calcium
hydroxide nanoparticles penetrate easily into the cracks and damaged
zones of mortars and plasters. Their high surface area to volume ratios
offer strong reactivity with atmospheric carbon dioxide and bring
excellent binding properties.

Several methods have been used
for the synthesis of metal, metal
oxide, and metal hydroxide nanoparticles in liquid phases. Those can
be briefly classified as co-precipitation by synthesis of metals,
precipitation of metals by reduction, radiation-assisted reduction,
precipitation of oxides, sol–gel processing, reactions in constrained
environments (e.g., emulsion systems), templating, and stabilizing
the synthesis with polymers.6 In the case
of calcium hydroxide, nanoparticles with less than 150 nm sizes are
synthesized from CaCl2 at high temperatures (150–170
°C in glycol systems or microemulsion systems).7,8 Synthesis of Ca(OH)2 in aqueous systems and in dextran
solutions produced particles larger than 250 nm sizes.9,10 Other than calcium hydroxide nanoparticles, a novel nanocomposite
scaffold is developed by homogeneous deposition of hydroxyapatite
(HAP) on a cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) matrix suspension.11,12

Cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibers have been
investigated
for the synthesis of Ag, Au, and Pd metals, mostly to produce hybrid
systems for biomedical applications.13−15 In this study, carboxylated
cellulose nanofibers16 were used for the
first time to synthesize calcium hydroxide nanofibers by co-precipitating
from Ca(NO3)2 and NaOH in aqueous solutions
at room temperature. The objective of this study was not only to synthesize
nanosized calcium hydroxide particles with a facile method but also
to shed some light on the co-precipitation process in the presence
of cellulose nanofibers.

Experimental Section
Materials
Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared
by using hardwood pulp as a feedstock and applying 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
(TEMPO)-mediated oxidization along with mechanical defibrillation.16 Cellulose nanofibers were lignin- and hemicellulose-free
according to chemical analysis. The preparation of the cellulose nanofibers
with carboxylate functionalities is given with full descriptions by
Saito et al.17,18 The carboxylate contents of the
oxidized cellulose nanofibers were determined by using a conductivity
titration technique.17 CNF samples were
prepared at two levels of carboxylate concentrations: 0.70 and 1.27
mmol/g. They were referred to as CNF070 and CNF127, respectively.
Cellulose nanofibers have 500–2000 nm length and 4–6
nm width (Figure S1).

Anhydrous sodium
hydroxide [NaOH] and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate [Ca(NO3)2·4H2O] were purchased from Fisher Scientific
Canada. Solutions (0.4 M) of Ca(NO3)2 and NaOH
solutions were prepared employing deionized water.

Preparation of Nanolime Particles
First, 250 mL of
0.4 M Ca(NO3)2 and 100 mL of CNFs at various
fiber and carboxylate concentrations were mixed and stirred for 10
min, and then 250 mL of 0.4 M NaOH was added drop by drop into the
CNF suspension in Ca(NO3)2 solution. The color
of the CNF suspension turned milky, and the mixture was stirred at
35 °C for a period of time. Concentrations of both Ca(NO3)2 and NaOH were 0.167 mol·dm–3 in the final mixture. To purify the final milky precipitate, several
centrifugation and washing steps with deionized water were done to
remove NaNO3 and NaOH. The summary of prepared mixtures
is given in Table 1.

After the completion of reactions, samples were washed
and centrifuged
several times and redispersed in deionized water. Carbonation of Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles on cellulose nanofibers was evaluated by transferring
samples in Petri dishes, letting them dry under natural air convection,
and aging them for 90 days.

Characterization of Ca(OH)2/CNF Hybrids
The morphologies and sizes of Ca(OH)2 particles were visually
inspected by SEM using a Hitachi model S-4800 instrument equipped
with a field emission source operating at an accelerating voltage
of 30 kV. Samples were prepared by using 10 μL of redispersed
CNF/precipitation reaction mixtures after keeping in deionized water
for 24 h. Samples were mounted on a glow-discharged carbon-coated
Cu grid. Excess water from samples was taken out, and samples were
stained by depositing a drop of uranyl acetate solution (2 wt % in
water) on the grid for 5 min. The excess solution was absorbed on
filter paper, and the grid was dried at room temperature for 24 h
prior to obtaining the images.

FTIR spectra of CNF/precipitation
reaction products before and after atmospheric air carbonation were
acquired with a Varian FTIR spectrophotometer (FTS-7000) by using
freeze-dried samples at room temperature under continuous nitrogen
purging. Samples were scanned by using an attenuated total reflection
(ATR) technique, and plots of transmission (%) versus wavenumbers
were obtained in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1 by cumulating 32 scans.

The thermal decomposition behavior of CNFs and CNF/precipitation
reaction products before and after atmospheric air carbonation was
determined by using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA 500, TA instrument).
Samples (20 mg) were heated with a heating rate of 10 °C/min
from 25 up to 1000 °C, while the apparatus was continually flushed
with a N2 flow of 40 mL/min.

Results and Discussion
Hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide)
was produced by adding NaOH solution
dropwise into the Ca(NO3)2 solutions in CNF
suspensions while stirring. The following well-recognized reaction
takes place:  Since Ca(OH)2 is scarcely soluble
in water (ksp = 5.5 × 10–6 and solubility in water is 0.233 mmol·dm–3 at 20 °C), it precipitated under the condition of a high degree
of supersaturation (Table 1). The precipitation of Ca(OH)2 particles without
cellulose nanofibers in aqueous solutions resulted in hexagonal prismatic
crystals as illustrated in Figure 1a. Individual Ca(OH)2 particles were relatively
uniform with 2 μm width and 200 nm length; however, they formed
aggregates and precipitated. In the next run, the same precipitation
experiment was carried out in the presence of 0.167 g·dm–3 cellulose nanofibers, which have a 0.70 mmol/g carboxylate
concentration on fiber surfaces (CNF070). Smaller calcium hydroxide
particles with a width of 100–200 nm were generated under these
conditions. Individual calcium hydroxide particles were still in a
hexagonal prismatic shape, and no visible attachments of calcium hydroxide
particles on cellulose nanofibers were observed by SEM in Figure 1b. Those particles
were smaller than the ones (∼296 nm) obtained by Samanta et
al., which were obtained by applying a similar chemical process with
calcium nitrate dihydrate and sodium hydroxide as precursors, however,
without the presence of any templates.10 Increasing the CNF070 concentration in the aqueous phase to 0.333
g·dm–3 resulted in the deposition of smaller
particles with less than 10 nm size onto cellulose nanofiber surfaces
(Figure 1c), in addition
to bigger (∼50 nm) irregularly shaped particles that were not
attached to cellulose nanofibers. Those bigger particles are more
visible on the lower-magnification view in Figure 1d. The XRD pattern of these samples still
showed the characteristics of hexagon-shaped portlandite. Hence, the
presence of CNFs in the suspension resulted in (1) Ca(OH)2 particles with particles sizes of around 50 nm, which did not have
well-defined shapes and did not attach onto the cellulose nanofibers,
and (2) much smaller Ca(OH)2 particles around cellulose
nanofibers. Both of those particles were much smaller than the nanoparticles
synthesized from reaction media in glycols (∼100 nm)8 and in aqueous ionic and nonionic dextran solutions
(∼1000 nm).9 The role of cellulose
nanofibers was investigated further by increasing the CNF070 concentration
in the solution from 0.333 to 1.167 g·dm–3.
Aggregates of much smaller particles and a network of cellulose nanofibers
were seen at the CNF suspension with a concentration of 1.667 g·dm–3 (Figure S2). The carboxylate
functional groups on cellulose nanofibers due to TEMPO-mediated oxidation
also affected both the size and morphology of Ca(OH)2 particles.
Increasing the carboxylation content of CNFs from 0.70 to 1.27 mmol/g
while keeping the CNF concentration in solution constant at 0.333
g·dm–3 resulted again in a shape change from
irregularly shaped particles to pearl-like spherical nanosized Ca(OH)2 particles. Cellulose nanofibers, CNF127, were all wrapped
with calcium hydroxide nanoparticles (Figure S3).

Figure 1 SEM of calcium hydroxide particles prepared with mixing 0.167 mol·dm–3 NaOH and 0.167 mol·dm–3 Ca(NO3)2 in (a) the absence of CNFs and the presence
of (b) 0.167 g·dm–3 CNF070, (c) 0.333 g·dm–3 CNF070 with higher magnification, and (d) 0.333 g·dm–3 CNF070 with lower magnification.

The reaction time for the formation of Ca(OH)2 had a
significant effect on the morphology of particles. Experiments were
carried out by reacting 0.167 mol·dm–3 NaOH
with 0.167 mol·dm–3 Ca(NO3)2 in the presence of 0.167 g·dm–3 CNF127,
which has 1.27 mmol/g carboxylate groups on the CNF surfaces (Figure 2). A reaction time
of 15 min resulted in nanometer-sized nonuniform prismatic calcium
hydroxide particles mostly unattached onto CNF surfaces in addition
to some bigger hexagon-shaped particles. However, increasing the reaction
time to 60 min generated pearl-like spherical nanometer-sized Ca(OH)2 particles built on the cellulose nanofibers having approximately
the same size as the nonuniform prismatic particles observed after
15 min of reaction.

One of the objectives for producing calcium hydroxide
nanoparticles
is to utilize them as a binder for cultural heritage structures, which
heals the cracks of limestones by an effective carbonation process
under atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the reaction of the Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid system with atmospheric carbon dioxide is crucial.
The carbonation process of Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles in the
CNF hybrid systems was tested by spreading them as films and aging
them under atmospheric conditions for 90 days. Figure 3 shows the SEM picture of a 90 day-aged Ca(OH)2 nanoparticle/CNF hybrid system, which was obtained by following
experimental run 4 listed in Table 1. The carbonation process produced a stable polymorph
of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), calcite.

Figure 3 SEM of 90 day-aged calcium
hydroxide nanoparticle–CNF hybrid
systems, which were prepared by mixing 0.167 mol·dm- NaOH and
0.167 mol·dm–3 Ca(NO3)2 in the presence of 0.333 g·dm–3 CNF070 and
are shown in two different magnifications.

The FTIR spectra of a freshly synthesized Ca(OH)2/CNF
hybrid matrix (obtained by reaction 4) along with their exposure to
open air for 90 days from thick and thin dried layers of films are
shown in Figure 4a.
The fresh sample was almost all Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid systems
with the main strong adsorption peak at 3640 cm–1, which corresponds to OH stretching of Ca(OH)2, and signature
bands at 1050 cm–1 from the C–C bond and
1165 cm–1 from the C–O–C asymmetrical
stretching mode of the cellulose backbone. Exposure of dried Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid films to atmospheric air resulted in the conversion
of Ca(OH)2 to calcium carbonate with the main CO3 peaks at 710, 870, and 1400 cm–1. The thin layer
of dried Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid film showed a total conversion
of Ca(OH)2 to CaCO3 as opposed to a thick layer
of dried film, which resulted in only a limited conversion to CaCO3. The carbonation was slower in the case of a thick film than
a thin film because the cellulose nanofibers delayed the diffusion
of atmospheric carbon dioxide through the hybrid Ca(OH)2/CNF film. Figure 4b shows the thermogravimetric analysis of a fresh Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid system, which was obtained by the reaction 4 (Table 1) procedure and its
aging after 90 days under open air along with a CNF sample before
the preparation of Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid materials. As can
be seen, in the case of CNFs, cellulose without the presence of any
Ca(OH)2 decomposed over a narrow temperature range, between
280 and 360 °C. This is a very well-defined decomposition temperature
range, which is due to cellulose’s very homogeneous semicrystalline
structure of linked d-glucose units. The weight loss observed
between 100 and 150 °C in all three samples was due to the loss
of residual moisture. In the case of the Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid
material, the moisture loss was ∼2.1%. The fresh Ca(OH)2/CNF system showed a primary weight loss around 500 °C
due to the decomposition of Ca(OH)2 to CaO and H2O at 512 °C. In the case of the 90 day-aged sample, the magnitude
of such decomposition decreased drastically at 512 °C, and another
major weight loss appeared at 800 °C. It was due to the conversion
of Ca(OH)2 by carbonation to CaCO3 after 90
days of aging under atmospheric air. Such CaCO3 decomposed
to CaO and CO2 at 825 °C.

analysis plots of a freshly generated Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid
film after 90 days of exposure to air along with CNFs.

The yield of formation of Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles
based
on the added amount of Ca(NO3)2 can be estimated
by following the decomposition of fresh Ca(OH)2 to CaO
and H2O from TGA. The weight loss due to H2O
generation around 512 °C was 22.17% from the fresh Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid system in reaction 4. Hence, the amount of Ca(OH)2 in the Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid system was 91.2% according
to a simple stoichiometric calculation (22.17 × MWCa(OH)2/MWH2O). Consequently, the CNF
content in the hybrid system was found to be 6.8% after accounting
the moisture content of 2.1%. This gives the w/w ratio of Ca(OH)2/CNF to be 13.6. The stoichiometric amount of Ca(OH)2 formed was 6.72 g in the reaction pot, which also contains 0.333
g of CNF. Hence, the theoretical w/w ratio of Ca(OH)2/CNF
was 18.6. Therefore, one can calculate the yield of Ca(OH)2 particles on CNFs to be 73% (13.6 × 100/18.6). This gave the
CNF a surface coverage of 4.5 × 10–14 g·mm–2 based on a 300 m2/g specific surface area
of the CNF. X-ray diffraction patterns after aging showed that the
calcite (CaCO3) phase was formed by carbonation of Ca(OH)2 under atmospheric air and identified as rhombohedral calcite
(Figure S4).

Although experiments
were limited and the theory of formation of
nanoparticles nevertheless was not trivial, results were still used
to postulate particle formation mechanisms. The precipitation and
formation of calcium hydroxide nanoparticles in the presence of carboxylated
cellulose nanofiber suspensions must be discussed by considering the
effects of cellulose nanofibers on the nucleation and crystal growth.
Cellulose nanofibers can be considered as templates for the precipitation
of calcium hydroxide, like the use of cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose
nanofibers where Ag and Au metal ions were precipitated from their
precursor metals.19 The reaction can also
be considered as co-precipitation, which involves the direct co-precipitation
of Ca2+ and OH– ions in the presence
of carboxylated CNF suspensions maintained at basic conditions.6 In another way, the precipitation reaction can
be considered in a constrained environment due to the cross-linked
network formation of cellulose nanofibers.20

The co-precipitation process of calcium hydroxide involves
two
stages: a short burst of nucleation and growth of nuclei. The nucleation
is driven by the degree of supersaturation, S = C/Ceq where C and Ceq are the Ca(OH)2 concentration
at saturation and equilibrium. In our case, those were 0.333 and 0.0233
mol·dm–3, respectively, in the reported experiments.
Thus, the driving force for the precipitation was ΔC = C – Ceq =
0.310 mol·dm–3. The rate of nucleation per
unit volume, RN, is proportional to exp(1/ln2S) if all other reactions are kept constant.
In the presence of cellulose nanofibers, the barrier to overcome for
nucleation is expected to be further reduced due to nucleation on
CNF surfaces. Heterogeneous nucleation depends on the contact angle
(θ) of the nucleus on CNF surfaces. Hence, the free energy needed
for heterogeneous nucleation (ΔGhet) is expressed as the product of homogeneous nucleation (ΔGhomo) and a function of contact angle (f(θ)).21 For a total nonwetting
case (θ = 180°), the nucleus has no affinity for the substrate
and no heterogeneous nucleation happens. On the other side, ΔGhet approaches zero for a full wetting case
(θ → 0°). Hence, the buildup of calcium hydroxide
nanoparticles suggested that nuclei formation in the bulk liquid phase
was drastically lowered, and CNF surfaces acted like heterogeneous
nucleation sites. Ca2+ cations adsorbed on negatively charged
carboxylated CNF surfaces are expected to be ideal sites for the nucleation
(Graphical Abstract, Scheme a). As discussed by Cushing et al., there
is a slow growth of the nuclei occurring either by a diffusion-controlled
or surface reaction-controlled process.6 Experimental evidence, such as a decrease in nanoparticle size with
an increase in CNF concentration, suggests that the precipitation
reaction of calcium hydroxide nanoparticles in CNF suspensions was
diffusion-controlled.

Another likely mechanism is the deposition
of “liquid-phase
nucleated” calcium hydroxide particles onto cellulose nanofibers
by colloidal deposition before growing further in the liquid phase.
In addition to the adsorption on CNFs, calcium ions also form bridges
between the nanofibrils at high NaNO3 salt concentrations
and generate three-dimensional networks.22 In an aqueous environment of high pH, the zeta potentials of calcium
hydroxide nanoparticles and carboxylated cellulose nanofibers are
around +710 and −50 mV, respectively.23 Hence, colloidal deposition of Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles onto CNFs is favorable. These conditions most likely
favor the colloidal parakinetic deposition of “early-stage-grown”
calcium hydroxide nanoparticles onto cellulose nanofibers inside the
Ca2+ cross-linked networks of cellulose nanofibers (Graphical
Abstract, Scheme b).

Conclusions
Carboxylated cellulose nanofibers in Ca(NO3)2 solutions at room temperature were used for
the first time to harvest
calcium hydroxide nanoparticles with less than 50 nm particle size
and in the form of deposits on the CNF surfaces. The process is simple
and solvent-free and did not employ any surface active agent. If desired,
Ca(OH)2/CNF hybrid systems can also be used by drying and
reintroducing them into another polar organic solvent such as ethanol
or butanol instead of water. In addition, the presence of CNFs in
the hybrid system can offer better rheology control if the formation
of nanolime films is desired. The resulting calcium hydroxide nanoparticles
were effectively carbonized and generated calcite under atmospheric
conditions. The formation of smaller-size calcium hydroxide nanoparticles
is believed to be the result of more than one mechanism; nevertheless,
both of them depend on the adsorption of Ca2+ cations onto
carboxylated cellulose nanofibers. First of all, adsorption of calcium
cations initiate heterogeneous nucleation of CNF surfaces and growth
of Ca(OH)2 particles around fiber surfaces. Second, calcium
ions bridge between the nanofibers at high NaNO3 salt concentrations
and generate a three-dimensional network. This condition most likely
favors the colloidal deposition of liquid-phase nucleated calcium
hydroxide nanoparticles onto cellulose nanofibers inside the Ca2+ cross-linked networks of cellulose nanofibers. Further studies
are warranted to elucidate and control the formation of nanoparticles
with those two mechanisms by investigating the counterions coming
from calcium salts, temperature, mixing conditions, and preparation
procedures.
