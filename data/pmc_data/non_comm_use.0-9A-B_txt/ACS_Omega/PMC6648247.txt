Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been applied to
measure the H2S gas response of the sensor fabricated on
reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-incorporated nano-zinc oxide (n-ZnO)
composites. These nanocomposites were prepared by a facile one-step
solution route at room temperature. The structural, surface morphological,
and elemental analyses of the composite material have been investigated.
EIS was carried out to study the H2S gas-sensing properties
of fabricated sensors. The developed sensor showed an optimal H2S gas response to various concentrations ranging from 2 to
100 ppm at 90 °C. The H2S gas-sensing performances
of pure n-ZnO and various concentrations of rGO-incorporated n-ZnO
were evaluated. The H2S gas-sensing results showed that
n-ZnO/rGO composites exhibited high response when compared to pure
n-ZnO. The enhanced H2S response was speculated to be ascribed
due to two factors. First, rGO creates reactive sites for H2S molecule adsorption. Second, rGO has great electrical conductivity
compared to n-ZnO that enables the active transport of electrons from
H2S gas on interaction with the sensing layer, resulting
in enhanced gas response at 90 °C temperatures.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen
sulfide (H2S) gas is extremely toxic to humans,
and it causes damage to the human nervous system.1−3 Human tolerance
limit toward H2S is around 250 ppm, and exposure above
this threshold can cause severe illness and death. H2S
gas is often produced in sewage pits, coal, coal-oil, or natural gas
industries, and H2S has been used as a process gas in various
sectors such as chemical industries, heavy water plant, and so forth.4−6 Therefore, these gases have to be continuously screened at trace
levels with a suitable sensor. There are several types such as optical,
electrochemical, and metal oxide-based sensors that are available
for monitoring H2S.7 Among these,
semiconducting nanometal oxide-based materials have been widely used
for the detection of toxic gases because of their simple construction,
low-power consumption, and significant physical and chemical properties.6,8 The disadvantages of metal oxide-based sensors are poor selectivity
and slow response. Moreover, the recovery of the sensor is more than
1 h when the sensor was operating at room temperature. To overcome
such drawbacks, metal oxide–graphene oxide (GO) compositions
with several synthetic techniques have been focused by many research
groups.9−13

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analysis
has
been considered as a most sensitive technique to measure the gas-sensing
performance because it helps to identify individual properties such
as grain bulk, grain boundary, an interface between electrode and
sensing layer. Thus, the EIS technique was chosen for the evaluation
of gas response as it is more appropriate to elucidate the mechanism
of a gas sensor. The electrical current response of the studied system
can be monitored using this sensitive technique by applying a periodic
small amplitude signal.14,15 These signals can be
used to sense different reactions which occur on the electrode surface.
Therefore, this technique is an efficient tool to investigate the
surface processes owing to its inherent capability of providing the
accurate data. EIS results consist of correlation of the impedance
spectra features with underlying microstructural origins of recorded
behaviors by means of the appropriate and reasonable equivalent circuit.16

In the era of nanometal oxide-based gas
sensor, nano-ZnO and graphene-based
materials open up a new way to increase the gas response and fast
response of the gas sensor. ZnO/graphene-based nanocomposites for
the detection of polluting gases such as hydrogen, acetylene, formaldehyde,
and ammonia have been reported by many research groups.17−27 They have reported that the nanometal oxide decoration on the reduced
GO (rGO) surface increases the overall active sensing surface area
and consequently increases the analyte gas molecule adsorption as
the gas-sensing progresses. Singh et al. developed a ZnO–rGO-based
gas sensor for the detection of CO, NH3, and NO gases at
room temperature for concentrations as low as 1 ppm.11 Liu et al. developed ZnO–rGO-based gas sensors,
which exhibit higher sensitivity, shorter response, and recovery time
than those of the sensors based on rGO alone for the detection of
NO2. They further concluded that the sensing performances
had been enhanced by the introduction of ZnO nanoparticles into the
rGO matrix.28−30 On the basis of the above-mentioned superior properties
of ZnO/rGO, this combination was chosen for the gas-sensing purpose.

Researchers have reported on the various types of ZnO/rGO hybrid
material-based gas sensors, but reports on rGO-incorporated n-ZnO
for H2S gas by EIS are rarely found. In this scenario,
n-ZnO and n-ZnO/rGO composites were synthesized and sensors were fabricated
to measure the H2S gas response with various concentrations
on these nanocomposites by EIS. The mechanism for the H2S gas-sensing performances of n-ZnO/rGO composites is also proposed.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Graphite
powder, sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (30%), potassium
permanganate (KMnO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), zinc acetate
dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O),
trisodium citrate dihydrate (HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2·2H2O), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased
from SRL and Sigma-Aldrich (AR grade). All of the chemicals used in
the following experiment were of analytical grade and used without
further purification.

2.2 Synthesis of ZnO Nanoparticles
Zinc
oxide nanoparticles were prepared according to the procedure reported
elsewhere,31 with suitable changes in the
concentration of the reactants. Briefly, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) (0.1 M) and (HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2·2H2O) (0.25 M) were dissolved
into 80 mL of deionized (DI) water under stirring to obtain crystal
clear solution, and then pH was increased to 11 by the addition of
0.1 M NaOH under constant stirring. Then, the reaction solution was
stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The white precipitates obtained
were separated by centrifugation (9000 rpm) and repeatedly washed
with DI water and ethanol to remove contaminants. Finally, the collected
samples were dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C in air.

2.3 Synthesis of GO
GO nanosheets were
prepared by the modified Hummer’s method.32 In brief, 0.5 g of graphite powder was mixed with 0.25
g of NaNO3 followed by the addition of conc. H2SO4 under continuous stirring for 1 h. Then, 1.5 g of
KMnO4 was added slowly to the above reaction mixture while
maintaining the temperature <20 °C to prevent overheating
and explosion. The reaction mixture was continued to stir at 35 °C
for 12 h. Further, the above reaction mixture was diluted with 500
mL of DI water under vigorous stirring. The resulting suspension was
further mixed with 30% H2O2 solution to confirm
the completion of the reaction with KMnO4. The obtained
reaction mixture was thoroughly washed with 5% HCl aqueous solution
and DI water. The resulting precipitates were filtered, dried, and
stored in a vial.

2.4 Synthesis of n-ZnO/rGO
Composites
The synthesized GO was dispersed in DI water at
different concentrations
of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mg/mL using the ultrasonication
process for 2 h. Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) (0.1 M) is dissolved in 80 mL of DI water under constant stirring
to form a transparent solution. GO (0.25 mg/mL) is added drop by drop
into the solution. Then, HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2·2H2O) (0.25 M) is added slowly into the solution
dropwise, and then pH was increased to 11 by the addition of 0.1 M
NaOH under constant stirring. Subsequently, the reaction solution
stirred for 3 h at room temperature. Thus, GO is converted to rGO
which is incorporated on the n-ZnO matrix. The precipitates obtained
were separated by centrifugation (9000 rpm) and repeatedly washed
with DI water and ethanol to remove impurities, followed by drying
overnight in an oven at 80 °C in air. This procedure was followed
for all different concentrations of GO (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mg/mL).
The n-ZnO/rGO composites with different concentrations were prepared
as follows: 0.25 mg/mL (n-ZnO/rGO-1), 0.5 mg/mL (n-ZnO/rGO-2), 0.75
mg/mL (n-ZnO/rGO-3), 1.0 mg/mL (n-ZnO/rGO-4), and 1.25 mg/mL (n-ZnO/rGO-5).

2.5 Characterization Techniques
The prepared
materials were characterized using various analytical techniques.
Structural properties of pure n-ZnO and n-ZnO/rGO composites were
analyzed with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (model, Rigaku Ultima
IV) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation with a 2θ
scanning range of 10°–80°. The functional group identification
of pure n-ZnO and n-ZnO/rGO composites was studied using Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra (model, Bruker Tensor-27 FTIR spectrometer).
The particle surface morphology, size, and the elemental analysis
of pure n-ZnO and n-ZnO/rGO composites were observed using a field
emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (model, Carl Zeiss Supra
55), attached with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system.

2.6 Fabrication and Gas-Sensing Measurements of
the n-ZnO/rGO Gas Sensor
The sensors were fabricated following
a two-step process. Step 1: precut polycrystalline alumina
substrates (size—10 × 10 × 2 mm) were used for the
deposition of sensing materials. Prior to the deposition, the alumina
substrates were cleaned using acetone. This was followed by interdigiting
the electrode (120 nm thick with 1 mm spacing) using a silver-conducting
paste by screen printing on the alumina substrate. The substrates
then dried at 150 °C in a hot air oven for 2 h. Step 2: 1% (w/w) of n-ZnO/rGO composites was mixed with 1% (v/w) α-terpineol
to form a rheological paste. The paste was then screen-printed on
the pre-interdigitated electrode (IDE) formed on the alumina substrate
(as described in step 1). Finally, the substrates were dried at 120
°C for 1 h.

A schematic diagram of experimental setup and
its representation of H2S gas sensing mechanism on fabricated
n-ZnO/rGO composites is shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. In order to measure the
gas-sensing characteristics of the films, the electrical contacts
were made on IDE using a platinum wire. The gas-sensing experiments
were carried out in a home-made (volume 500 cm3) gas testing
chamber made up of stainless steel. The operating temperature was
controlled using a proportional-integral-derivative controller which
was integrated with a gas testing chamber. Precalibrated gas canisters
were procured commercially. A desired concentration of the test gas
in the chamber is achieved by injecting known amount of analyte gas
using a microsyringe. The impedance change was monitored using an
Impedance analyzer in built with a Potentiostat (Bio Logic—SP
240). The impedance responses were measured in the frequency range
between 1 MHz down to 1Hz.

composites.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of n-ZnO
and rGO-Incorporated
n-ZnO
Figure 2a shows XRD patterns of n-ZnO, and Figure 2b–f shows rGO-incorporated
n-ZnO with various concentrations of rGO. The major peaks obtained
in Figure 2 were observed
at 2θ values of 31.8°, 34.4°, 36.3°, 47.5°,
56.6°, 62.8°, 66.4°, 67.9°, and 69.1° which
corresponds to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200),
(112), and (201) crystalline planes of n-ZnO, respectively. It is
confirmed that the n-ZnO nanoparticles are of hexagonal (wurtzite)
phase which are matched with standard JCPDS no. 36-1451.

Figure 2 XRD spectra
obtained for (a) n-ZnO, (b) n-ZnO/rGO-1, (c) n-ZnO/rGO-2,
(d) n-ZnO/rGO-3, (e) n-ZnO/rGO-4, and (f) n-ZnO/rGO-5.

XRD patterns in Figure 2b–f indicate that there are peaks
which were observed
for rGO. It is also noted that the ZnO peak intensity starts to decrease
and rGO(002) peak intensity starts to increase with the increase in
concentration of rGO on n-ZnO. This is due to the reduction of GO
during the preparation of rGO-incorporated n-ZnO where the crystallized
n-ZnO assembled on the rGO plane prevented the face-to-face regular
restack of rGO.33

Figure S1a shows FTIR spectra of n-ZnO,
and Figure S1b–f shows rGO-incorporated n-ZnO with various
concentrations. Figure S1a shows FTIR spectra
of n-ZnO, which showed a peak at 444 cm–1 corresponding
to the Zn–O stretching vibration. It is also noticed that this
peak is red shifted to 413 cm–1 in the rGO-incorporated
n-ZnO. As the concentration increases, the peak at 444 cm–1 is shifted to 413 cm–1, whereas with the increase
in concentration (n-ZnO/rGO-5), the peak was observed exactly at 413
cm–1. This is due to the interactions between ZnO,
residual epoxy, and hydroxyl functional groups of the rGO which increases
on increasing the concentration. The absorption peaks around 3460
and 1403 cm–1 are attributed to the O–H stretching
vibration and C–OH group vibration, respectively, and a new
absorption band at 1558 cm–1 can be assigned to
the skeletal vibration of the rGO sheets. The major peaks at 1625
and 1040 cm–1 indicate the presence of rGO phase
present along with ZnO matrices. The obtained FTIR results of ZnO
and ZnO/rGO are consistent with the reported research articles.34−36 Raman spectra of n-ZnO/rGO-5 are discussed in Figure S2.

The surface morphology of as-synthesized
pure n-ZnO and rGO-incorporated
n-ZnO (n-ZnO/rGO-5) is shown in Figure 3a,b and c,d, respectively. rGO and other composites
(ZnO/rGO-1 to ZnO/rGO-4) are shown in Supporting Information Figure S3a–e. Figure 3a,b represents ZnO nanoparticles with a flower-like
structure. It is observed that the synthesized particles are free
from agglomeration, and Figure 3c,d represents the rGO-incorporated n-ZnO. It can be seen
that the prepared composites are in present as nanosheets which are
free from agglomeration. Moreover, it is observed that the rGO sheets
covered on ZnO nanoflowers, rGO sheets on ZnO increased when increasing
the concentration of rGO shown in Figure S3, and it confirms the presence of rGO sheets on ZnO.

Figure 3 FESEM images of (a,b)
n-ZnO and (c,d) n-ZnO/rGO-5.

The elemental composition of the as-synthesized pure n-ZnO
and
n-ZnO/rGO-5 nanocomposites was investigated by EDS and is shown in Figure S4a,b, respectively. Figure S4a shows selected area of EDS spectra of the synthesized
pure ZnO. It can be seen that the presence of well-defined peaks of
Zn and O elements confirmed the formation of high-purity n-ZnO powders
free from any other impurities. To confirm the incorporation of rGO
in the n-ZnO composite, the selected-area EDS spectrum is given in Figure S4b. The presence of elements Zn, O along
with C atoms in the EDS spectra further confirms the incorporation
of rGO in n-ZnO powders. It also further confirms that the prepared
nanocomposites are free from impurities.

3.2 H2S Gas-Sensing Characteristics
In ambient atmospheric
conditions, the highly active surface of
a nanostructured ZnO/rGO film is covered with physisorbed (physical
adsorption) as well as chemisorbed (chemical adsorption) gas species.
The majority of these moieties belongs to oxygen and H2O. In the absence of H2O vapor, the main adsorbed moieties
at the surface are oxygen molecules.37 Metal
oxide-based gas sensors show changes in impedance spectra of the sensing
material because of the chemical and electronic interactions that
take place between the adsorbed analyte gas and the sensing materials.
The response of the sensor strongly depends on oxygen adsorption,
and this is strongly influenced by temperature. The oxygen adsorption
reaction can be described as follows:

At low temperature (below
100 °C) 1  

At moderate temperature (100–300
°C) 2  

At high temperature (above 300 °C) 3  

AC impedance spectroscopy
was recorded to further explain the gas-sensing
properties of n-ZnO and various concentrations of rGO-incorporated
n-ZnO nanocomposites. Both n-ZnO and rGO have the ability to trap
analyte gases and bring a change in the conducting properties. Generally,
the resistance (R) and constant phase element (CPE; Q) become dominant in the gas-sensing mechanism. The fabricated
n-ZnO/rGO nanocomposite gas-sensing device composed of grain (bulk)
and grain boundaries (Rg, Rgb). In the Nyquist plot, the high-frequency regime would
explain bulk properties, the mid-frequency regime would explain grain
boundary properties, and the low-frequency regime would explain the
electrode contact properties indicating the existence of ionic transportation.38−42

The total impedance (ZT) of the
n-ZnO/rGO
sensor structure can be drawn as follows  where Zg represents
the complex impedance contribution from grain boundaries, Zgb represents the complex impedance contribution
from grain bulk, and Zc represents the
complex impedance contribution from metal to electrode contact.

In order to optimize the operating temperature, the fabricated
sensor was operated at various temperatures. Figure S5a–f shows the H2S (2 ppm) gas response
of n-ZnO and rGO-incorporated n-ZnO with various concentrations with
respect to various temperatures. From the figure, we can observe that
n-ZnO/rGO-5 shows maximum response at 90 °C when compared to
other concentrations. It is noted that at low temperature, the response
of the sensor is not maximum, further increasing the temperature,
the response of sensors is decreased. Further, the ZnO/rGO-5-based
sensor was chosen and exposed to various concentrations of H2S at 90 °C in order to elucidate the individual properties such
as grain bulk and grain boundary resistance. A summary data of obtained
GO-based H2S gas sensor results, and those reported elsewhere
is given in Supporting Information Table
S1.

Figure 4 shows
the
typical Nyquist plot of ZnO/rGO-5 exposed to air and H2S gas with various concentrations ranging from 2 to 100 ppm at 90
°C. The figure shows semicircle and the diameter of the semicircle
decreased with increasing H2S gas concentration. The −Im(Z) values are smaller than the Re(Z) values,
indicating the contribution from CPE in the equivalent circuit.43

Figure 4 Nyquist impedance plot of ZnO/rGO-5 nanocomposites exposed
to air
and various concentrations of H2S gas (2–100 ppm)
at 90 °C.

The obtained impedance
values are fitted (Z fit,
software, EC-Lab, V10.37) and corresponding equivalent circuit presented
in Figure 4 (inset).
The best fitted values are obtained by placing CPE instead of capacitance,
and the results are presented as a solid line which indicates the
best fitting. The CPE element generally defines that the behavior
of microstructure such as the grain boundary gives rise to different
distributions of respective relaxation time.

Table 1 shows that
the R1 (grain bulk) values are decreased
as increasing H2S gas concentration ranging from 2 to 100
ppm. On the other hand, the R2 (grain
boundary) values decrease drastically than R1, indicating that the grain boundary resistance plays a major
role in gas-sensing characteristics. When the sensor exposed to ambient
air, the adsorbed oxygen molecules can capture free electron of ZnO
and formation of charge depletion layer which induces the resistance.44 The depleted layer controls the electron mobility
and density in the n-ZnO/rGO nanocomposites.

Upon injection
of H2S gas, the adsorbed oxygen releases
previously trapped electron back into the ZnO conduction band, causing
increase in electron concentration in ZnO; this result decreases the
height of the barrier potential at the grain–grain contacts
shown in Figure 5.
Thus, the impedance (Z) of the n-ZnO/rGO decreases
as increasing H2S gas concentration. Hence, it is concluded
that the grain boundary resistance is significantly affected by H2S gas concentration. No significant changes in the CPE values
(Q) were observed from Table 1. This result further confirms that the grain
boundary of n-ZnO/rGO has largely affected by the H2S gas
concentration.

mechanism.

Figure 6 shows the
imaginary part of impedance for n-ZnO/rGO-5 exposed to air and various
concentrations of H2S gas (2–100 ppm) at 90 °C.
From this figure, the peak frequencies related to the relaxation frequencies
of ZnO/rGO-5 impedance were observed and estimated by plotting the
−Im(Z) versus the logarithmic frequency. It
can be seen that the imaginary part of impedance decreases in the
case of H2S gas concentration. As increase in H2S gas concentration decreases the barrier height causing more electrons
to flow. The peak shifting toward high frequencies is related to an
ease in the flow of charge carriers to the ac electric field.45−47

part of impedance for n-ZnO/rGO-5 exposed to air and
various concentrations of H2S gas (2–100 ppm) at
90 °C.

Figure 7 shows the
gain curve of n-ZnO/rGO-5 under various H2S concentrations
(2–100 ppm) at 90 °C. The response of the
H2S gas sensor was evaluated as a function of frequency
with H2S gas concentration (2–100 ppm) using the
equation given below 4  where Za represents
the impedance of air and Zg represents
the impedance under H2S gas. The response of the fabricated
device shows better response with the increase in H2S concentration
at low frequency (<100 kHz). This is due to the decrease in grain
boundary resistance. Response versus gas concentration is also discussed
in Figure S6.

exposed to various concentrations of
H2S gas (2–100 ppm) at 90 °C.

The response and recovery curve of n-ZnO/rGO upon
exposure to 2
ppm H2S. It was observed that the response and recovery
of the sensor are about 8 and 32 s, respectively. This indicates that
the response and recovery performance of the developed sensor toward
H2S gas shown in Supporting Information Figure S7. For real-time applications, the gas sensor should have
the ability of selectivity to distinguish different kind of detected
gases. Hence, the n-ZnO/rGO-5 deposited on the alumina substrate was
exposed to H2S, C2H2, CO, NH3, SO2, and H2 at 90 °C. The obtained
results are presented in Figure 8. The gas response strongly depends on the crystal
structure, grain size, and defect density of the materials. Long-term
stability and humidity are also discussed in Supporting Information Figures S8 & S9. The fabricated sensor (n-ZnO/rGO-5)
was found to show the maximum selectivity toward H2S in
comparison with commonly present interfering gases.

of a n-ZnO/rGO-5 deposited on the alumina
substrate upon exposure to 2 ppm of H2S, C2H2, CO, NH3, SO2, and H2 at
90 °C.

The mechanism for H2S gas sensing based on n-ZnO/rGO-5
composites could be described as follow: the conductive rGO has a
chemically active defect site; hence, it is a hopeful active materials
in gas sensors.47,48 In addition, when the sensors
were exposed to ambient atmospheric air, the atmospheric O2 was adsorbed on the surface of n-ZnO, resulting in the formation
of O– ions by catching electrons from
the conductance band of n-ZnO. During this process, a charge depletion
layer was formed and high resistance state was observed on the n-ZnO/rGO-5
composites. When the n-ZnO/rGO-5 composite sensor was exposed to H2S which is a reducing gas, it releases electrons back into
the conduction band of n-ZnO, resulting in flowing electron from ZnO
to rGO, leading to increasing conductivity. The enhanced gas response
of n-ZnO/rGO composites for H2S at 90 °C temperature
is due to two main aspects. First, rGO creates reactive sites for
H2S molecule adsorption. Second, rGO has great electrical
conductivity compared to n-ZnO that results in enhanced transport
of electrons from gas interaction in the sensing layer, leading to
enhancement of gas response at low temperature.

4 Conclusions
n-ZnO and n-ZnO/rGO composites were successfully
prepared using
a facile one-step solution route at room temperature. The XRD patterns
of n-ZnO and n-ZnO/rGO composites were indexed on the basis of the
hexagonal structure. FESEM studies confirmed that the as-prepared
n-ZnO and n-ZnO/rGO-5 particles are nanometer in size (80–100
nm). The sensor was fabricated using n-ZnO/rGO-5 composites, and it
was able to detect H2S with concentration ranging from
2 to 100 ppm at 90 °C. Further, it was found that n-ZnO/rGO-5
films are highly selective toward H2S when compared to
other n-ZnO/rGO concentrations. Nyquist plot strongly supported for
impedance findings. The grain boundary resistance and barrier height
were decreased as the concentration of H2S gas increases
from 2 to 100 ppm. These results indicate the better performance of
stable H2S gas sensor on n-ZnO/rGO-5 in ppm range at 90
°C.
