Research into perovskite-based light-emitting
diodes (PeLEDs) has
been rapidly gaining momentum since the initial reports of green-emitting
methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3)-based devices were published. However, issues pertaining
to its stability and morphological control still hamper progress toward
high performing devices. Solvent engineering, a technique typically
employed to modulate film crystallization, offers little opportunity
for scale-up due to the tendency for inhomogeneous film growth and
low degree of reproducibility. Here, we propose and show a simple
gas-facilitated process to deposit a stable, all-inorganic perovskite
CsPbBr3 film. The formation of smaller and less percolated
grains, which gives rise to enhanced optical properties, highlights
the importance of spatial charge confinement in the film. Consequently,
the performance of our PeLEDs shows great improvement, with luminance
as high as 8218 cd m–2 and turn-on voltage as low
as 2.4 V. Concomitantly, the current efficiency and EQE of our device
were increased to 0.72 cd A–1 and 0.088%, respectively.
High reproducibility in the performance of PeLEDs fabricated using
this process opens the path for large-area devices.

Introduction
Perovskites have gained
much attention from the scientific community
in the last decade, creating waves particularly in the field of photovoltaics.
Although traditionally used to classify materials adopting a structure
similar to that of calcium titanate,1 in
recent research in the field of solar energy, this term refers specifically
to a compound comprising an organic–inorganic hybrid cation
(CH3NH3+), a divalent metal (Pb2+), and a monovalent halide anion (I–),
arranged in a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra surrounding the central CH3NH3 cation. The unprecedented expeditious rise in power conversion efficiencies
for perovskite-based solar cells, from a mere 3.8%2 to an excess of 20%,3,4 puts it in the same
stead as the best in class thin-film CIGS and CdTe solar cells to
date.5 It is thus unsurprising that this
new generation of photovoltaics has managed to claim a spot in the
list of Science’s Top 10 Breakthroughs in
2013.6 The versatility and excellent optoelectronic
properties exhibited by this principal material, such as balanced
long-range charge transport,7,8 long carrier lifetimes,8,9 and tunable band gap,10,11 have not only made
perovskites superb light harvesters but also promising emitters for
lighting and display technologies.

Research into perovskite-based
light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has
been swiftly gaining momentum since the first report, which described
an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite emitter layer (CH3NH3PbBr3) sandwiched between a hole
transport material (PEDOT:PSS) and an electron transport material
(poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl), also known
as F8) that reached a maximum luminance (Lmax) of 364 cd m–2 and a current efficiency of 0.3
cd A–1.12 The high color
purity, coupled with the low costs associated with the ease of material
synthesis and device fabrication, makes PeLEDs an attractive candidate
for display applications. Within a short span of 2 years, works carried
out to further enhance device performance (such as by tailoring the
interfacial charge transport layers,13−15 employing a polymer-perovskite
blend,16,17 and using solvent engineering techniques
to enhance film formation18,19) have given rise to
improvements in current efficiency of up to 42.9 cd A–1 and in external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 8.53%.18 Despite its outstanding potential, long-term
stability has been one of the major concerns hindering its widespread
use. Moisture exposure can induce degradation of the material due
to the affinity of organic cations to water molecules.20 Moreover, its thermal stability is also governed
by the low-temperature sublimation of the organic cations. Fully inorganic
perovskite materials have been reported by substituting the organic
cation with Cs+, giving the materials higher resistance
to thermal degradation.21−24 However, research into these materials has been minimal
as compared to that of their organic–inorganic counterparts.
The first CsPbBr3 PeLED paper reported a reduced trap density
with excess CsBr in the precursor solution, where the material achieved
an Lmax of 407 cd m–2 and a current efficiency level of 0.035 cd A–1.21 The passivation of atomic Pb defects
with the excess CsBr was key to reducing nonradiative decay pathways,
as supported by Cho’s group.18 Zhang
et al. also demonstrated PeLEDs employing CsPbBr3 nanocrystals,
which achieved an improved Lmax and current
efficiency of 1377 cd m–2 and 0.19 cd A–1, respectively, through interface engineering.25 Recently, a new synthetic approach of PEO-assisted CsPbBr3 films has been demonstrated, yielding a smoother and pinhole-free
morphology with smaller crystals, leading to highly luminescent and
efficient PeLEDs.26

In both organic–inorganic
hybrid (CH3NH3PbBr3) and fully inorganic
(CsPbBr3) systems,
a smaller grain size and thus increased grain boundary area are expected
to be beneficial for PeLEDs due to the spatial confinement of excitons
and charge carriers within the restricted nanoscale geometries that
consequently blocks their diffusion and thereby increases radiative
recombination.27 This has been demonstrated
in several reports where processing has been modified in various ways
to modulate grain size, such as through nanocrystal pinning,18 a quick annealing process,28 and incorporation in a polymer matrix.26 Morphology has therefore been reaffirmed to be a critical
factor in determining the performance of the final devices,29,30 and this can be tuned via engineering the deposition and formation
of the perovskite thin film.

Film formation plays a pivotal
role in determining the morphology,
which in turn is responsible for the resultant properties of the perovskite
film, especially the charge carrier dynamics.9 A major factor influencing this is the crystallization rate. Padture
et al. reported a comprehensive study to understand solution-processed
perovskite film formation, with a particular emphasis on the nucleation,
growth, coarsening, and evolution aspects.31 The slow evaporation of commonly used solvents (e.g., dimethylformamide
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) due to their high boiling points somewhat
hindered the perovskite crystallization during the spin-coating process.
As a result, low nuclei density led to acicular structures and incomplete
coverage from the conventional spin-coating process.32 A commonly used method to circumvent this problem and achieve
highly efficient perovskite solar cells and PeLEDs is to use a solvent
engineering method, whereby an antisolvent such as toluene or chloroform
is introduced to supersaturate the perovskite precursor solution and
induce precipitation.33−36 Using this method, the nucleation rate is greatly enhanced and the
growth rate is suppressed simultaneously,37 resulting in a smooth and fine-grained film with good coverage.
However, scale-up production of such devices remains hampered by low
reproducibility arising from a propensity for a radial and inhomogeneous
growth gradient as well as the toxic nature of commonly used antisolvents.38,39

To generate a large nuclei density in a short period of time
without
the use of antisolvents, an alternative gas-facilitation method is
proposed. In this article, we show that by using a simple additional
step of nitrogen (N2) gas flow during the film formation,
we can achieve remarkable improvements in the performance of our PeLED
devices. This is possible due to the smaller and less percolated grains
formed as a result of the accelerated supersaturation and rapid crystallization
facilitated by the introduction of N2 gas, thus allowing
for spatial charge confinement and enhanced radiative recombination.
By optimizing the pressure and timing of the gas flow, highly luminescent
green-emitting PeLEDs based on CsPbBr3 were fabricated
with an Lmax exceeding 8000 cd m–2, a turn-on voltage as low as 2.4 V, a current efficiency level in
excess of 0.7 cd A–1, and an EQE of over 0.08%.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
a schematic diagram of the N2-facilitated deposition process
adopted for this study. The CsPbBr3 solution used was prepared
with excess CsBr, in a manner similar to that previously reported.21 The only difference lies in the introduction
of N2 gas into the chamber midway during the spin-coating
process.

formation during the spin-coating process. (b) XRD spectra (* corresponds

and (d) time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves (solid
lines are fitted curves) of conventional (black) and N2-facilitated (red) CsPbBr3 films.

Material Characterization
Figure 1b showcases the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of the films fabricated using the two methods. Both patterns reveal
similar reflections at 2θ values of 15.15, 21.55, 30.35, and
34.50°, corresponding to the orthorhombic (Pnma) crystal structure of CsPbBr3. Both films were
preferentially oriented in the (202) direction with lattice parameters
of a = 8.22(6) Å, b = 11.80(3)
Å, and c = 8.30(5) Å and a = 8.22(9) Å, b = 11.79(9) Å, and c = 8.31(7) Å for the conventional and N2-facilitated films, respectively, which is in good agreement with
previous reports.21,40 Negligible variance in lattice
parameters indicates similar stress and strain levels in both films.41 The absence of characteristic CsBr peaks in
both patterns confirms the absence of crystalline CsBr in the samples
despite the addition of excess precursor material, as was previously
reported.21 By taking into consideration
the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) and the integral breadth of
all peaks, the crystallite sizes were calculated to be ca. 20 nm for
both deposition routes.

Figure 1c shows the normalized steady-state PL and absorbance
spectra of the films fabricated using the two techniques. Although
both films exhibited narrow green emission with a FWHM of 17 nm, a
slight blue shift (ca. 2 nm) was observed from 526 nm for the conventional
to 524 nm for the N2-facilitated film (Table 1). The blue shift in the steady-state
PL is attributed to the inner filter effect due to a change in the
optical density of the film. This is supported by the lower absorbance
recorded across the scanned wavelengths for the N2-facilitated
sample. From the correlation between PL and absorption, it can be
readily deduced that the PL emission exhibits band to band characteristics.
It should also be noted that the presence of excitonic peaks, detected
in the absorption spectra of both films contribute toward the enhancement
of absorption near the band gap. The effective optical band gap of
the films will thus deviate from the electronic band gap of 2.3 eV
due to the need for exciton binding energy considerations in the calculation,
as previously reported by Kumawat et al.42

Recent literature has reported the coexistence of both three-dimensional
CsPbBr3 and zero-dimensional Cs4PbBr6 (Bergerhoff–Schmitz–Dumont-type crystal structure)43 crystals from solution growth.44,45 The large difference in solubility between CsBr and PbBr2 in DMSO resulted in the different reactivity of both dissolved species,
leading to CsBr-rich Cs4PbBr6 precipitating
alongside CsPbBr3. However, the absence of any characteristic
XRD peaks in our films verifies that Cs4PbBr6 is not present. The single PL peak for both samples (at 524 and
526 nm) also confirms the absence of Cs4PbBr6, which emits at 520 nm. Because Cs4PbBr6 has
a stronger emission at excitation wavelengths of λ > 340
nm,45 to substantiate our claim, additional
PL measurements
were taken at various excitation wavelengths ranging from 300 to 470
nm (Figure S1). Again, no additional PL
peak was observed. As Cs4PbBr6 is insoluble
in DMSO, it most likely precipitated in the precursor solution. The
XRD patterns shown in a previous report confirmed the presence of
Cs4PbBr6 in the precipitates.21 The resultant clear supernatant, which was used for subsequent
spin-coating, is thus free of this impurity compound.

To investigate
the charge dynamics, photoluminescence quantum yield
(PLQY) and TRPL measurements were carried out and the results are
summarized in Table 1. The N2-facilitated film shows a slightly higher PLQY
of 13% as compared to 11% for the standard film. The TRPL decay spectra
(following excitation at 400 nm) for both films are shown in Figure 1d. The PL decay lifetimes
were determined by fitting with a single exponential decay function
(solid line). The characteristic PL lifetime (τPL) extracted is 4.9 ± 0.1 ns for the standard film and 3.7 ±
0.1 ns for the N2-facilitated film. From this, the radiative
(τrad) and nonradiative (τnonrad) recombination lifetimes can be calculated using τrad = τPL/⌀ and τnonrad = τPL/(1 – ⌀), where ⌀ represents PLQY.46 The much shorter radiative lifetime of ∼
29 ns for the N2-facilitated film is ascribed to the smaller
and more isolated grains seen from the surface imaging of the film
(discussed subsequently), consequently restricting charge movement
and triggering faster recombination. The nonradiative lifetime, however,
was slightly shorter for the N2-facilitated film (∼
4.3 ns), due to the increased surface area of the isolated grains
resulting in additional nonradiative recombination channels.47,48 Hence, the higher PLQY for the film with smaller grain size is a
result of the enhanced radiative recombination rate inside the grains,
which overwhelms the enhanced nonradiative recombination rate at the
grain boundaries.

The surface topology and cross-section imaging
of the deposited
films are shown in Figure 2. Stark dissimilarities in the film morphology using field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were observed for the
two films, where noticeably smaller and less percolated grains were
present in the N2-facilitated film. This is attributed
to rapid nucleation as a result of the sudden N2 flow,
leading to the generation of high nuclei density and suppression of
grain growth. However, this also led to a slightly reduced film coverage
(Figure 2b). This was
further verified using ImageJ, whereby the film prepared via the conventional
process showed approximately 80–90% surface coverage whereas
the N2-facilitated films showed 65–70% surface coverage.
Cross-section imaging indicated a thinner film (85 ± 10 nm) for
the N2-facilitated method (Figure 2d) as compared to a thicker film (130 ±
10 nm) via the conventional process (Figure 2c). The thinner and smaller grains more easily
confine charges within their geometrical constraints, bringing about
a higher probability of radiative recombination, as shown by the shorter
radiative lifetime.

Device Performance
To investigate the effect of the
film morphology on the operation of the CsPbBr3 emitters,
complete PeLED devices were fabricated with CsPbBr3 sandwiched
between a hole transport material (PEDOT:PSS) and an electron transport
material (bathophenanthroline or Bphen). Figure 3a shows the device architecture along with
the corresponding energy levels of each layer. The current density
and luminance versus driving voltage (J–V–L data) as well as the current
efficiency curves of the devices are presented in Figure 3c,d, respectively. The reproducibility
and distribution of the device performance (up to nine devices) can
be found in Figure S8. From the J–V curves (logarithmic plot in Figure S2), the conventional and N2-facilitated devices exhibit an ohmic conduction (m = 1) of up to 1.0 and 1.6 V, respectively. Higher current in the
ohmic conduction region was observed for the N2-facilitated
devices, which could be attributed to the lower surface coverage of
the perovskite film. A trap limited conduction region (m > 2) was observed up to 5.0 and 3.2 V for the conventional and
N2-facilitated devices, respectively, followed by a pseudo
space
charge limited region (m = 2) at higher voltage where
carrier recombination is limited by the transport of charges from
either the electron or hole transport material or both.49 The sharp current turn-on from the N2-facilitated device indicates that charge injection into the CsPbBr3 layer upon overcoming the energy barrier is far more superior,
due to the undulating morphology of the perovskite providing a higher
interfacial area for contact with the electron transporting material,
thereby explaining the higher charge injection. However, the premature
current turn-on voltage as well as the gentle slope in the trap limited
conduction region of the conventional device indicate a higher level
of defects in the film and lower conductivity of the material as compared
to that of the N2-facilitated device.

and corresponding energy levels of various layers in the CsPbBr3 PeLEDs used in this work. (b) Electroluminescence spectra
of both devices at different driving voltages. Pictures in inset show
sample devices under applied bias. (c) Current density and luminance
vs driving voltage, (d) current efficiency vs current density, and
(e) EQE vs luminance curves of both devices.

As compared to the conventional method, devices made with
the N2-facilitated film showed substantial improvement
in luminance
turn-on voltage, Lmax, and current efficiency
(Table 2). The remarkable
turn-on voltage as low as 2.4 V, which is almost comparable to the
electronic band gap of the active material (∼2.3 eV), means
that charge carrier transport and injection into the perovskite emitter
are extremely efficient. Despite possessing a higher current turn-on
voltage, which signifies a higher carrier injection barrier, the light
turn-on voltage for the N2-facilitated devices is lower.
This means that once the carriers are injected, they are recombining
more effectively, which is explained by the enhanced spatial confinement
effect imparted by the smaller grain volumes.18 The current efficiency (Figure 3d) increases with increasing current density and the
highest current efficiency was achieved at a high current density
(∼1000 mA cm–2), indicating that the efficiency
is limited by traps or defects in the device. The champion cell showed
an Lmax of 8218 cd m–2 at an astonishingly low voltage of 5.0 V. In contrast, the reference
device emitted a much weaker Lmax of 2964
cd m–2. Interestingly, the luminance tripled (based
on average Lmax) even though the coverage
was slightly reduced (Figure 2b). This improvement is again ascribed to the enhanced radiative
recombination bestowed by the spatial constraints that more effectively
trap injected charge carriers within the smaller and more isolated
grains.18,27 The high brightness at exceptionally low
voltages (∼5 V) also indicates superb carrier confinement within
the perovskite emitter layer.50 At higher
voltages, a crossover between the current curves was observed (Figure 3c, current curves),
which means that a much higher luminance was achieved at a lower current
density for the N2-facilitated device. This is again due
to the ease of charge recombination within the smaller domain of each
grain, which leads to a huge enhancement in the current efficiency
of the N2-facilitated device at a much lower current density
(Figure 3d), giving
a maximum of 0.718 cd A–1, which is more than 6
times that of the reference device. Future work will entail identifying
the dominating process for the drop in voltage across the interface
leading to variation in the ideality factor as well as decoupling
the impact the deposition technique has on the transport and injection
of carriers into the emitter layer. Comparison of EQE was conducted
by testing one average device from both experimental methods and plotting
the data against the luminance, as shown in Figure 3e. The results show a similar enhancement
from 0.020% for the conventional to 0.088% for the N2-facilitated
device, indicating lower energy loss and reiterating the importance
of the charge confinement effect.

The electroluminescence (EL) spectra of both devices measured from
5 to 6 V are plotted in Figure 3b. Similar to the discussion above, the N2-facilitated
device show a several-fold enhancement in the number of counts collected,
corresponding to a higher luminance. At low voltage (5 V or less),
the EL spectra for the standard and N2-facilitated device
centralize at 526 and 524 nm, respectively, which is in good agreement
with the PL spectra of the respective films (Table 1). At higher voltages, a blue shift of 2–3
nm was observed for both EL spectra, resulting in final peaks at 523
and 522 nm. This phenomenon was also previously observed in organometal
halide PeLEDs12 and is likely due to Joule
heating during device operation. More in-depth studies on the thermochromic
effect in perovskite films have been conducted by Wu et al., relating
the phenomenon to electron–phonon renormalization.51

To prove that the enhanced device performance
is predominantly
due to spatial charge confinement within the smaller perovskite grains
rather than the thickness difference, additional conventional devices
were fabricated by increasing the spin-coating speed to 5000 rpm to
achieve an average thickness of 82 nm, which is on par with that of the N2-facilitated
film. Cross-sectional FESEM images as well as device performance data
are shown in Figures S3 and S4, respectively,
with the characteristic device parameters summarized in Table S1. Here, it is shown that although both
films have the same thickness, the N2-facilitated device
still outperforms the conventional one due to the formation of smaller
grain structures. Further studies were also conducted to investigate
the effect of the pressure of N2 gas flow and the timing
at which it is introduced (additional material characterization and
device results can be found in Figures S5–S9). It was found that by further increasing the pressure of the N2 flow to 2 bar, no improvement in device performance was noted
but rather the luminance and current efficiency were somewhat diminished
(Table S1 and Figure S8). Although the
grain size was reduced with higher N2 pressure (Figure S6), the poorer device performance is
likely ascribed to the additional nonradiative recombination channels
formed as a result of the increased surface area of the more isolated
grains. The N2 pressure was then maintained at 1 bar and
the timing of the N2 gas introduction was varied at 1,
3, and 5 s from the start of the spin-coating process. The surface
topography (Figure S7) showed negligible
difference and all 3 devices gave comparable figures of merit (Table S1 and Figure S9) with an average Lmax, turn-on voltage, and current efficiency
within 6000–7000 cd m–2, 2.6–2.7 V,
and 0.2–0.3 cd A–1, respectively. It is henceforth
concluded that the timing of N2 introduction is not a critical
factor in determining the performance of the N2-facilitated
PeLEDs.

Conclusions
In this work, we have
demonstrated the importance of charge confinement
in PeLEDs through a solution-processed, N2-facilitated
film formation technique of CsPbBr3, yielding enhanced
EL and efficiency in LED operation. This modus operandi combines the
action of rapid supersaturation and pinning of the nucleated crystals
to achieve smaller grain sizes and less percolated microstructures.
As a result, this led to better spatial confinement of the charge
carriers and thus improved radiative recombination and light emission.
By optimizing the pressure and timing of the N2 gas flow,
we achieved highly bright PeLEDs (Lmax = 8218 cd m–2) with improved efficiencies (current
efficiency = 0.718 cd A–1 and EQE = 0.088%) and
an extremely low turn-on voltage (Vth =
2.4 V). The type of gas flow is not limited to N2 and any
inert dry gas should accomplish the task. Future work will encompass
improvement of the coverage and compactness of the film morphology
to maximize the surface area of light emission. Additional electrical
studies will also be performed to investigate what is the limiting
carrier and at which interface recombination is taking place in order
to further improve the device architecture. This work presents a facile
and scalable method to fabricate high-performance PeLEDs, paving a
luminous route toward future lighting and display applications.

Experimental
Methods
Device Fabrication
The devices were made on indium-doped
tin oxide (ITO, 7 Ω cm–2)-coated glass substrates.
Firstly, the substrates were cleaned sequentially using decon soap,
deionized water, and ethanol. This was then followed by drying and
plasma treatment for 15 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was
spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 60 s and annealed for 15 min at 130 °C.
The CsPbBr3 solution was synthesized as previously reported,
with a 2:1 molar ratio of CsBr (Aldrich, 99.9%) and PbBr2 (Aldrich, 99.999%).21 The chemical precursors
were mixed in DMSO solvent (0.5 M concentration) and the clear supernatant
was used for all subsequent spin-coating steps. The standard film
was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and the N2-facilitated
sample was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 12 s with N2 gas
introduced at a pressure of 1 bar (14.5 psi) from an approximate distance
of 2 cm above the spinning substrate. The gas flow was initiated 3
s from the start of the spin-coating process and allowed to continue
right to the end. For convenience, the terms “conventional”
and “N2-facilitated” are used to refer to
the standard and N2 gas-facilitated processes in that order.
Thereafter, the films were left to dry for 30 min at ambient temperature
before annealing at 70 °C for 5 min. Bathophenanthroline (Bphen)
(Aldrich, 97%) (25 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) were thermally evaporated
to form the electron transporting layer and cathode, respectively.
The evaporation was carried out under high vacuum (<1 × 10–6 Torr) and thereafter encapsulated prior to testing.
The final cell size was measured to be 7 mm2.

Film and Device
Characterization
All PeLED device characterization
was carried out outside the glovebox in ambient conditions. The device
characteristics (J–V–L) and EL spectra were collected using a Keithley 2612B
source meter and an OceanOptics QE Pro spectrometer connected to an
integrating sphere, operated using Ciemo LabVIEW software. PL measurements
were carried out using a Shimadzu RF-5301pc spectrofluorophotometer
at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The absolute PLQY were measured
using an OceanOptics USB4000 spectrometer connected to an integrating
sphere and excited using a laser at a wavelength of 405 nm. Time-resolved
PL was performed using a streak camera system (Optronis Optoscope).
The 400 nm pump pulse was generated by frequency doubling the 800
nm pulse from the regenerative amplifier (Coherent Libra, pulse width
50 fs, repetition rate 1 kHz) using a BBO crystal. All cross-sectional
and topological imaging was done using FESEM (JEOL JSM-7600F). The
XRD patterns were obtained using an XRD Bruker D8 Advance.
