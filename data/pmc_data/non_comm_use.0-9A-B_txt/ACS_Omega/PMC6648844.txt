Two
dimeric supramolecular structures {MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine}2—(1) and {ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine}2—(2) formed from two molecules of magnesium
and zinc aquaphthalocyanines in 4-methylmorpholine solution were revealed
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Coordinated H2O molecules
to the metal center of respective Mg or Zn phthalocyanines oriented
face-to-face to form two hydrogen bonds, one of them connecting via
O–H···N-azamethine atom to form a dimeric structure
in the crystals with ring-to-ring distances of 3.412(3) Å in 1 and 3.403(5) Å in 2, whereas the second
hydrogen bonds link the solvent 4-methylpholine molecules to form
supramolecular dimeric {MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine}2—(1) and {ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine}2—(2) structures. The interaction of the
metal center of MgPc or ZnPc with O atom of the water molecule results
its displacement of ∼0.5 Å from the N4-isonodole
plane of the phthalocyaninate(2-) macrocycle that adopts a saucer-shape
form. To better understand the interactions leading to the existence
of the dimeric structures in the crystals, theoretical calculations
of dimer stabilization energy composed of two monomers (MgPcH2O and ZnPcH2O), as well as three-dimensional molecular
electrostatic potentials, have been performed using the density functional
theoretical method. The calculated absorption spectra of both supramolecular
monomers and dimers were compared with the experimental ones in 4-methylmorpholine
solution. The water axial ligation of MgPc and ZnPc and the formation
of the monomeric and dimeric supramolecular structures only slightly
change the energy gap between highest occupied molecular orbital and
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels that is compared with those
of the parent MgPc and ZnPc pigments.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Metallophthalocyanines have been accidentally discovered at the
beginning of the twentieth century as a by-product1 and as a copper salt about 20 years later.2 They are very important class of compounds because of the
many important features, which offer varied applications. Because
of their intense blue-violet color, metallophthalocyanines were earliest
used in industrial applications as pigment and dyes.3 Additionally, the importance of metallophthalocyanines
rapidly increases in many other fields. They are used as organic materials
for optoelectronic and photoelectronic devices, active matrix displays,
photoconductors, and materials for solar cell and optical storage.4 Moreover, the metallophthalocyanines are used
in catalysis application,5 chemical and
gas sensors,6 and corrosion inhibitors.7 Many metallophthalocyanines can be used as materials
for nonlinear optical limiting devices.8 In addition, the metallophthalocyanines are used as photosensitizers
in photodynamic therapy (PDT) because of their intense strong absorption
in the therapeutic region of visible radiation.9 However, their limited solubility and aggregation in biological
systems are a very common feature in this family of compounds because
of their extended π-electron delocalized systems that decrease
their fluorescence quantum yields and shorten their triplet lifetime
which reduces their photosensitizing efficiency.10

In order to improve the solubility of the metallophthalocyaninte
complexes is to modify the phthalocyaninato(2-) macroring by substitution
of the peripheral and/or nonperipheral hydrogen atoms by various substituents
such as alkyl, aryl, alkyloxy, aryloxy, and others11 or by additive metal center ligation12 because of their steric hindrance that lowers the π···π
stacking interaction in solids.13 Water
with its hydrogen-bonding interactions, which is very important and
common in biological systems,14 has rarely
been used as a ligand for additive metal center complexation, except
for the phthalocyaninate complexes with the main group IIA metal of
Mg and Be.15 Because of their relatively
low electronegativity,16 both can coordinate
using the outer p orbitals (Be) or p and d (Mg, d0). The
Zn(II) as a transition metal with completely filled orbits d (d10) and the greater electronegativity than Mg or
Be is harder to form coordination bond with water. However, for the
tetra-substituted phthalocyaninato zinc complex by 3-pentyloxy groups
in nonperipheral positions, which probably play an important role
in promotion and formation of the coordination bond between water
molecule and zinc(II) center of phthalocyanine was obtained and to
the best knowledge, it is the first and only complex of zinc(II) phthalocyanine
derivative with axially coordinated water molecule that was structurally
characterized.17

However, in contrast
to the magnesium and beryllium phthalocyanines
(MgPc and BePc), the axial binding of water through the metal center
in the unsubstituted zinc(II) phthalocyanine has not been known so
far. Therefore, the aim of this work was to obtain a crystalline form
of the zinc phthalocyaninato complex with an axially coordinated water
molecule and to compare its possibilities to the formation of water-involved
hydrogen-bonded dimeric supramolecular structure, which is observed
in the case of aqua of the magnesium and beryllium phthalocyaninate
complexes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
Freshly obtained crystalline
MgPc and ZnPc by thermal reaction of metal powders with phthalonitrile
at 250 °C (in the case of MgPc) and 220 °C (for ZnPc), respectively,
were added to 4-methylmorpholine (25 mL) and sealed under reduced
pressure in a glass ampoules. Next, they were thermally processed
for 2 days at 80 °C, and then, they were cooled to room temperature.
After such a process, no crystals were observed in the ampoules; therefore,
they were opened and filtered, and the filtrates were left at ambient
temperature. The filtrates were partially covered for slow evaporation
and crystallization. After about one month, blue-violet crystals suitable
for the single-crystal X-ray analysis were obtained. In the solution,
the metal center of MPc (M = Mg and Zn) interacts with the oxygen
atom of water molecule forming MPc-derivative with the axial M ←
O coordination bond and, over time, Mg- or Zn-aquaphthalocyanines
have interacted with each other via hydrogen bonds through the coordinated
water molecules and the N-azamethine atoms to form dimeric structures.
The dimeric structures of (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2 with the hydrogen-bonding active sites interact
with solvent 4-methylmorpholine via O–H···N
hydrogen bond forming dimeric supramolecular structures {MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine}2—(1) and {ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine}2—(2) that crystallize as well-developed blue-violet single crystals.
For understanding the interactions between the reacted molecules,
the three-dimensional molecular electrostatic potential (MESP)18 has been calculated. The MESP maps of the substrate
molecules and for the reaction product molecules are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. In the solution, the electropositively polarized
metal center of MgPc or ZnPc interacts with the electronegatively
polarized oxygen atom of water, and in result, the M ← O coordination
bond is formed, yielding the respective M(II)Pc(H2O) complexes:
MgPc(H2O) and ZnPc(H2O). The three-dimensional
(3D) MESP maps of the monomers MgPc(H2O) and ZnPc(H2O) clearly show that the interactions between the monomers
take place via coordinated water molecules that form hydrogen bonds
with the N-azamethine of the neighboring phthalocyaninate macrocycle
forming dimeric structures, (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2. The 4-methylmorpholine that shows its 3D MESP
interacts with the dimeric complexes, (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2, via hydrogen bond formed between
the axially ligated water molecule and the N ring atom of the solvent,
yielding the {MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine}2 and {ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine}2 supramolecular
structures (Figure 3). The 3D MESP’s calculated for the dimeric building blocks
and the 4-methylmorpholine molecules allow better understanding of
interactions between them during nucleation, crystallization, and
their architecture in the solid state.19

2.2 Thermal
Properties
To determine the
thermal stability of the 1 and 2 complexes,
the thermal analyses on the samples of about 22 mg with the same heating
rate of 5 °C/min were performed. Crystals of MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine (1) are stable up to ∼140
°C (Figure S1a in the Supporting Information). The change in the mass of the sample is caused by the release
of solvent 4-methylmorpholine from the crystals that transform into
aquamagnesium phthalocyanine, which is stable up to ∼200 °C.
Above this temperature, the axial Mg–O bond breaks and the
sample gives free MgPc in the β-form that was confirmed by the
X-ray powder diffraction experiment. The corresponding mass losses
during heating are, respectively, 15.5 and 2.8% and are in agreement
with the calculated values of 15.42 (loss of 4-methylmorpholine) and
2.74% (loss of water).

Crystals of ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine
(2) are slightly thermally more stable than crystal 1, but similarly they are decomposed in two stages (Figure
S1b in the Supporting Information). The
first mass loss of ∼14.5% is concerned with the release of
solvent 4-methylmorpholine from the crystals at ∼150 °C,
and the second one of ∼2.6% is concerned with the release of
the coordinated water molecule (at ∼200 °C). Finally above
this temperature, the sample transforms into β-ZnPc. The calculated
values of 14.51% (loss of 4-methylmorpholine) and 2.58% (loss of water)
confirm the observed mass changes.

2.3 X-ray
Structural Studies
The molecular
structures of both Mg and Zn phthalocyaninato complexes, MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine (1) and ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine (2), were clearly
evidenced by the X-ray single-crystal analysis (Figure 4). Both complexes are isomorphic and crystallize
in the centrosymmetric space group of the triclinic system with a
pair of molecules in the unit cell. In both monomeric units, M(II)Pc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine (M(II) = Mg or Zn), the central
metal(II) ion is coordinated by the four isoindole nitrogen atoms
of the phthalocyaninate(2-) macrocycle and, in addition, by the oxygen
atom of water molecule in an axial position. Thus, the coordination
environment of Mg(II) and Zn(II) in these complexes exhibits square
pyramidal environment. The metal center of M(II)Pc that interacts
with the oxygen atom of water molecule (see 3D MESP maps, Figure 1) causes it to displace
from the plane defined by the four isoindole nitrogen atoms of the
phthalocyaninate(2-) toward O of the water molecule. The displacement
of Mg(II) from the above N(isoindole)4 plane is greater
by ∼0.11 Å than the displacement of Zn(II) (Table 1). As a result of such interaction,
the phthalocyanine (2-) macrocycle adopts a conformation that is saucer-shaped
with a base toward the metal(II) cation. The average inclination of
the isoindole rings to the N(isoindole)4 plane is comparable
in both complexes and is 3.9(1)° in Mg and 4.3(1)° in Zn
complexes. The four equatorial M(II)–N bonds are longer than
the axial M(II)–O bond in the Mg–phthaloyanine complex,
but the opposite relation between the equatorial and axial bonds is
observed in the Zn–phthalocyanine complex (Table 1). For comparison, in aquaberyllium
phthalocyanine complex that can crystallize with various solvent molecules
(pyridine, 2-picoline, or 3-picoline) giving solvated crystals, the
axial Be–O bond with a distance of ∼1.68 Å is significantly
shorter than the equatorial four Be–N bonds with an average
distance of ∼1.91.15d,15e The Be2+ cation with relatively high charge-to-radius ratio of ∼6
(2+/0.31)20 and according to hard/soft
acid/base principle21 forms easier the
coordination bond with oxygen atom than that with N atom.

Two M(II)PcH2O (M = Mg
and Zn) molecules related by
inversion interact with each other via a pair of O–H···N
hydrogen bonds forming a dimeric supramolecular structure (Table 2). In the (M(II)PcH2O)2 dimer, the axially ligated water molecules
play the role of donors and azamethine nitrogen atoms of Pc(2-) macrocyles
are acceptors of the hydrogen bonds. The distance between the water
oxygen and the N-azamethine atom in the (MgPcH2O)2 dimer is slightly shorter than that in (ZnPcH2O)2; in both dimers, the O···N distances are a
bit longer than that observed for the general hydrogen-bonded O···N
distance of 2.80 Å,22 indicating the
formation of weak hydrogen bonds between these atoms. Nevertheless,
the ring-to-ring separation of 3.412(2) Å in the (MgPcH2O)2 and of 3.403(3) Å in (ZnPcH2O)2 between partially overlapped phthalocyaninate(2-) macrocycles
in the dimers points on the π···π interactions
which stabilizing the water-involved hydrogen-bonded dimeric structures
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The axially coordinated water molecules in the (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O) dimers containing the donor
active sites in the 4-methylmorpholine solution interact via O–H···N
hydrogen bonds with N-ring atom of 4-methylmorpholine molecules that
seems to play an important role in the nucleation and crystallization
processes leading to the formation of the (MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine)2 (1) and (ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine)2 (2) crystals. Comparison of the geometries of
the (MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine)2 and
(ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine)2 dimers
is summarized in Table 3. In the crystals, such dimeric aggregates, (MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine)2 and (ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine)2, related by translation along [100] direction form a stacking structure
with π···π interaction (Figure 5). The distance of ∼3.3
Å in both Mg- and Zn-structures between the phthalocyaninate(2-)
macrocycles of the back-to-back oriented dimers indicates that this
interaction seems to be important in the nucleation process and crystals
growth.

2.4 Hirshfeld
Surface Analysis
Hirshfeld
surface23 and the analysis of 2D fingerprint
plots24 are good tools illustrating the
interactions between the components constituting the crystal. The
crystal structures of the investigated compounds, as discussed above,
are a good example of the interplay of different molecular interactions.
The HS mapped with the dnorm(25) and the 2D fingerprint plots was calculated
for both Mg and Zn complexes, for both monomers (Figure 6) and dimers (Figure 7). The first of them exhibits
the interaction between the monomers, whereas the second one shows
the interactions between the dimers in the crystals. In both crystals,
the monomers, MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine and ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine, interact each other via O–H···N
hydrogen bonds, and in the HS, the O···N interactions
represent the red color. The same interactions display a sharp shape
in the 2D-fingerprint plots. According to the Hirshfeld surface analysis
for the monomeric form of both Mg and Zn complexes, the contribution
of different types of interactions between monomers is 58.8 and 58.4%
for H···H dispersion forces, 6.4 and 6.6% for H···N
+ N···H, and 12.2 and 12.0% for the π···π
interactions, respectively, for the MgPc(H2O) and ZnPc(H2O). Fingerprint plots of the major contribution contacts in
the Mg- and Zn-monomers are illustrated in Figure S3 (in the Supporting Information). The percentage of the
main interactions between the Mg- and Zn-dimers that point the Hirshfeld
surface analysis is 62.6 and 62.4% for the H···H dispersion
forces, 15.1 and 15.5% for the π···π interactions,
and 9.8 and 11.3% for H···C + C···H
contacts, respectively, for the Mg- and Zn-dimers. The respective
contributions of these interactions in the 2D-fingerprint plots are
shown in Figure S4 (in the Supporting Information). The presence of these interactions between the dimers may also
be shown by the Hirshfeld surface mapped as the functions of di, de, shape index, and curvedness (Figure S5 and S6 in the Supporting Information). Analyzing the Hirshfeld
surface for the dimers in more detail, a small red area near the oxygen
atom of the 4-methylmorpholine ring can be seen, which indicates the
O···O interaction between the neighboring dimers in
crystals, which was also suggested in the checkcif_Platon_Raport;
however, the contribution of such O···O interactions
in the total surface is insignificant (0.5% for Mg-dimer and 0.6%
for Zn-dimer).

2.5 DFT Studies
Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations were carried out for both monomeric molecules building/constituting
the investigated crystals, that is, MgPc(H2O) and ZnPc(H2O), as well as for the dimers, (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2. Detailed geometrical parameters
for both monomers are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (in the Supporting Information) for MgPc(H2O) and ZnPc(H2O), respectively, whereas the selected parameters
are given together with the X-ray experimental values in Table 1. In general, the
DFT optimized parameters are in good agreement with those observed
by the X-ray analysis. However, some discrepancies between these values
can be found; it should be noted that the axial M–O bond is
longer in both Mg- and Zn-monomers than that in the crystals. In addition,
the displacement of the metal center of MPc (M = Mg and Zn) from the
N4-plane of Pc macrocycle is a little smaller (∼0.06
Å) than those in the crystals. The optimized geometry of the
MgPc(H2O) monomer exhibits C2v symmetry, whereas the ZnPc(H2O) monomer
has C1 symmetry (see Tables S1 and S2
in the Supporting Information). As can
be seen in the figure inside Table S1 (in the Supporting Information), the plane containing O of water coordinating
to Mg together with hydrogen atoms is perpendicular to the N4-isoindole plane of Pc in the MgPc(H2O), whereas the same
plane in the ZnPc(H2O) is inclined to the N4-isoindole plane by 34.8° (figure inside Table S2 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the nature of
the axial coordination M ← O in both MgPc(H2O) and
ZnPc(H2O) molecules is different. In the MgPc(H2O) molecule, the lone electron pair of O atom of coordinated water
molecule occupies the p orbital, whereas in ZnPc(H2O),
it occupies the sp3.

To further understand the interactions
leading to the formation of the (MgPcH2O)2 and
(ZnPcH2O)2 dimers, the optimization of the geometry
of the dimers using DFT calculations was performed. Optimized geometry
of both dimers exhibits an inversion center (Ci symmetry). View of the optimized dimers
is show in Figure 8. Comparison of the main DFT-optimized parameters that characterize
the geometries of the (MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine)2 and (ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine)2 dimers is summarized in Table 4, and in Tables S3 and S4 (Supporting Information). It is noteworthy that in the DFT optimized dimeric
structures, the distance between the N4-isoindole plane
of Pc macrocycles is 3.7234 and 3.8202 Å for (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2, respectively.
These values are slightly longer than the corresponding values in
the crystals (Table 3). The hydrogen bonds linking the monomers into dimeric structures
with donor···acceptor (O···N) distances
of 2.627 and 2.671 Å in (MgPcH2O)2 and
(ZnPcH2O)2, respectively. These donor···acceptor
(O···N) distances in the crystals are longer by ∼0.2
Å, but the correlation between the O···N distances
is preserved. For comparison, the DFT optimization of the (BePcH2O)2 dimer was carried out, and the geometry of
the (BePcH2O)2 is illustrated in Figure 8c, and the selected geometrical
parameters are summarized in Table 5, whereas the full detailed parameters are listed in
Table S5 (in the Supporting Information). In the (BePcH2O)2 dimer, the distance between
the N4-isoindole plane of Pc macrocycles is 3.7028 Å,
whereas the O–H···N hydrogen bond with O···N
distance of 2.646 Å lies in the middle between the values for
Mg- and Zn-dimers.

The stabilization
energy of the (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2 dimers arises from the presence
of two hydrogen bonds (O–H···N) linking the
monomers into dimeric forms as well as from the π···π
interactions between the Pc macrocycles (Figure 8). The stabilization energy of the dimers
was calculated as the difference between the energies of two monomers
and the energy of the dimer, which is the sum of the energy of two
hydrogen bonds O–H···N and the energy of π···π
interaction between the macrocycles. The stabilization energy for
the (MgPcH2O)2 dimer is ∼48.8 kcal/mol,
whereas that for the (ZnPcH2O)2 dimer is ∼46.2
kcal/mol. The contribution of π···π energy
in the total stabilization energy of dimer was calculated for both
Mg- and Zn-dimers by removing water molecules but the distance between
the rings was retained. The calculated stabilization energy between
Pc macrocycles for such (MgPc)2 and (ZnPc)2 moieties
with ring-to-ring distances of 3.7234 and 3.8202 Å is only 6.85
kcal/mol for Mg- and 5.22 kcal/mol for Zn-dimers. Thus, the O–H···N
hydrogen-bonding interaction is the dominate force responsible for
the formation of the water-involved dimeric supramolecular structures,
(MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2.

2.6 UV–Vis Spectroscopic Characterization
To further characterize both complexes, the electronic absorption
spectra were recorded. Because the crystals 1 and 2 contain 4-methylmorpholine as solvent molecules linked via
O–H···N hydrogen bonds with its N-ring atom,
therefore, the spectra were taken in solutions of 4-methylmorpholine
(Figure 9). The spectra
of both compounds show two bands (Q and B) characteristic for the
phthalocyaninate(2-) macrocycle.26 The
Q band is observed at ∼672 nm (log ε = 6.38) in the spectrum
of 1 and at ∼668 nm (log ε = 6.35) in the
spectrum of 2, whereas the B band is observed as a broad
band at ∼350 nm for both compounds. The Q band results from
an excitation between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and the B band
corresponds to the HOMO – 1 to LUMO level. The Q band in both
spectra is splitted because of the vibronic coupling.27

Figure 9 UV–vis spectra of 1 (a) and 2 (b)
in 4-methylmorpholine solution.

In order to better understand the optical properties of both
compounds,
the time-dependent TD DFT calculations have been performed. Optical
absorption spectra were calculated for both monomeric forms of complexes
(MgPcH2O and ZnPcH2O), which are present in
4-methylmorpholine solution after dissolving the crystals 1 and 2. In addition, the optical absorption spectra,
for a comparison, were also calculated for the substrate MgPc and
ZnPc molecules. The results are presented in Tables S6–S10
and Figure S7 (Supporting Information).
HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals and the calculated electronic absorption
spectra for MgPcH2O and ZnPcH2O complexes are
shown in Figure 10 and Table 6. The
calculated energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels is 2.0251 eV
(612 nm) for the MgPcH2O complex, whereas for ZnPcH2O, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels is 2.0568
eV (603 nm). In order to investigate the influence of π···π
interaction and O–H···N hydrogen bonds leading
to the dimers on optical properties, the TD DFT has also been performed
for the (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2 dimers and the results are summarized in Table S11 and S12
(Supporting Information). The calculated
electronic absorption spectra, partial energy diagram, and the HOMO
and LUMO frontier orbitals for the dimers (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2 are show in Figure 11. The calculated
energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO levels are 2.0670 eV (599 nm)
and 2.0977 eV (591 nm) for the (MgPcH2O)2 and
(ZnPcH2O) dimers, respectively. As shown by the TD DFT
calculation, the presence of dimeric forms of complexes causes only
a slight change in the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO levels compared
to the energy gap in monomers, which is almost the same in both dimers
and is about 13 nm.

Nevertheless, there are many papers reporting the
TD DFT calculations
performed on tetrapyrrole systems;28 however,
the works on TD DFT for unsubstituted magnesium and zinc phthalocyanines
and their axially ligated derivatives are relatively rare.29 Aromatic macrocycles including metallophthalocyanines,
especially zinc and magnesium phthalocyanines as nontoxic, are extensively
studied as photosensitizers in PDT because they exhibit a strong absorption
in the therapeutic window of 600–900 nm. Both investigated
here Mg- and Zn-phthalocyanine derivatives have a strong absorption
band in the therapeutic window, and the energy HOMO–LUMO gap
is sufficient to excite the ground state of oxygen; therefore, they
can be tested as potential photosensitizers. The calculated HOMO–LUMO
transition for Mg- and Zn-monomers as well as for Mg- and Zn-dimers
is shifted by ∼60 nm in relation to that of experimental values;
a similar discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values
was mentioned earlier.30

3 Conclusions
This work clearly shows the importance of hydrogen
bonding between
a water molecule coordinated axially with the metal center in MgPc
or ZnPc and the azamethine nitrogen of the adjacent phthalocyaninte
macrocycle to form water-involved supramolecular dimmers (MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2. DFT calculations
show the stabilization energies of ∼48.8 kcal/mol for the (MgPcH2O)2 dimer and of ∼46.2 kcal/mol for the
(ZnPcH2O)2 dimer. These dimers are additionally
stabilized by π···π interactions; however,
the contribution of π···π energy in the
total stabilization energy of dimers is relatively low and equal to
6.85 kcal/mol for Mg- and 5.22 kcal/mol for Zn-dimers. Time-dependent
(TD)-DFT calculated electronic spectra of the obtained complexes were
compared with the experimental electronic absorption spectra in solutions.
Thus, the ligation of MgPc and ZnPc by water do not change significantly
the energy gap of the HOMO–LUMO level of the monomeric form
(MgPcH2O and ZnPcH2O) as well as the dimeric
form [(MgPcH2O)2 and (ZnPcH2O)2] comparing to the parent MgPc and ZnPc pigments.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
The crystalline
form of MgPc and ZnPc was obtained from directly by the reaction of
the pure powdered magnesium or zinc with phthalonitrile as described
previously.31 4-Methylmorpholine was obtained
from Aldrich and used without further purification. The composition
of the obtained crystals was checked with a PerkinElmer 2400 elemental
analyzer and with energy-dispersive spectroscopy and with a PerkinElmer
240 elemental analyzer. The UV–vis spectra were recorded in
4-methylmorpholine solution (c = 10–6 mol/L) at room temperature using a Cary-Varian 2300 spectrometer.
Thermal analyses of solid 1 and 2 samples (mass of the samples of
22 mg) were carried out on a Linseis L81 thermobalance apparatus with
Pt crucibles. Powder Al2O3 was used as a reference.
The measurements were performed under static air on heating from room
temperature to 300 °C at the heating rate of 5 °C min–1.

4.2 Preparation Procedure
4.2.1 Synthesis of MgPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine
Complex (1)
MgPc (0.12 g) was added to 4-methylmorpholine
(25 mL). The suspension of MgPc in 4-methylmorpholine was degassed
and sealed under reduced pressure in a glass ampoule and was heated
at 80 °C for 2 days, and then, it was cooled to room temperature.
After such processing, the ampoule was opened and filtered. The filtrate
was left at room temperature at ambient atmosphere. After about four
weeks, single crystals of 1 suitable for the single-crystal
X-ray analysis were obtained. The crystals of 1 were
separated by filtration and dried in air. Yield: 0.0684 g (46.6%).
Analysis: found: Mg, 3.77; C, 67.57; N, 19.18; O, 5.07 and H, 4.41%.
Calculated for C37H29N9O2Mg: Mg, 3.71; C, 67.74; N, 19.22; O, 4.88; H, 4.45%.

4.2.2 Synthesis of ZnPc(H2O)·4-methylmorpholine
Complex (2)
ZnPc (0.12 g) was added to 4-methylmorpholine
(25 mL), and the procedure was similar to that previously used for
complex 1. Yield: 0.0725 g (50.1%). Analysis: found:
Zn, 9.42; C, 63.60; N, 18.02; O, 4.74; H, 4.22%. Calculated for C46H36N10OZn: Zn, 9.38; C, 63.75; N, 18.09;
O, 4.59; H, 4.19%.

4.3 X-ray Crystallography
The obtained
single crystals of 1 and 2 were used for
data collection on a four-circle KUMA KM4 diffractometer equipped
with a two-dimensional CCD area detector. Data collection and reduction
along with absorption correction were performed using CrysAlis software
package.32 The structures were solved by
direct methods and refined using SHELXL-2014.33 Hydrogen atoms of the phthalocyanine moiety were refined as rigid,
H atoms of 4-methylmorpholine, and water molecule was located on difference
Fourier maps, but in the final refinement, their positions were constrained.
Diamond 3.0 program34 was used for the
drawing of the structures. Details of the data collection parameters
and final refinement parameters are collected in Table 7.

4.4 Hirshfeld
Surface Analysis
Hirshfeld
surface analyses and 2D fingerprint plots were calculated using the
Crystal Explorer Ver. 3.1 program package.35

4.5 Theoretical Calculations
Molecular
orbital calculations with full geometry optimization of aquamagnesium
phthalocyanine MgPc(H2O) and aquazinc phthalocyanine ZnPc(H2O) were performed with the Gaussian16 program package.36 All calculations were carried out using the
DFT method (B3LYP)37 with the 6-31+G* basis
set38 assuming the geometry resulting from
the X-ray diffraction study as the starting structure. The calculations
were also performed for the substrates MgPc, ZnPc, 4-methylmorpholine,
and water molecules. The 3D MESP maps are obtained on the basis of
the DFT (B3LYP/6-31+G(d)) optimized geometries of reacted molecules
as well as for the reaction product molecules and are mapped onto
the total electron density isosurface. After the geometry optimization,
the TD-DFT calculations39 were performed
to evaluate the absorption spectrum employing the same level and basis
sets.
