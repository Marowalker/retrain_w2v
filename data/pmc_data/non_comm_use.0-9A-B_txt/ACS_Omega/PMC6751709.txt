The
new quaternary iodate KCu(IO3)3 has been
prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. KCu(IO3)3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n with unit cell parameters a = 9.8143(4) Å, b = 8.2265(4) Å, c = 10.8584(5) Å, β = 91.077(2)°, and z = 4. The crystals are light blue and translucent. There
are three main building units making up the crystal structure: [KO10] irregular polyhedra, [CuO6] distorted octahedra,
and [IO3] trigonal pyramids. The Jahn–Teller elongated
[CuO6] octahedra connect to each other via corner sharing
to form [CuO5]∞ zigzag chains along [010];
the other building blocks separate these chains. The Raman modes can
be divided into four groups; the lower two groups into mainly lattice
modes involving K and Cu displacements and the upper two groups into
mainly bending and stretching modes of [IO3E], where E
represents a lone pair of electron. At low temperatures, the magnetic
susceptibility is characterized by a broad maximum centered at ∼5.4
K, characteristic for antiferromagnetic short-range ordering. Long-range
magnetic ordering at TC = 1.32 K is clearly
evidenced by a sharp anomaly in the heat capacity. The magnetic susceptibility
can be very well described by a spin S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg chain with a nearest-neighbor spin exchange of ∼8.9
K.

Introduction
Compounds comprising
a p-element cation (L) such as Se4+, Te4+, or
I5+ with a stereochemically active
lone electron pair (E) have been attracting increasing interest due
to their rich chemistry, which can yield new compounds that often
show low-dimensional physical properties.1,2 Other
typical lone-pair elements, e.g., Pb2+ and Bi3+, often exhibit less stereochemical activity and have higher coordination
numbers.3,4 To tune physical properties such as geometric
magnetic frustration, semiconducting properties, or second harmonic
generation (SHG), the relation between structural characteristics
and physical properties is of utmost importance.5−8

Due to the volume occupied
by the lone-pair electrons, the L-cations
adopt one sided coordination, most often [LO3] trigonal
pyramids or [LO4] see-saws. By including the lone pair,
i.e., forming [LO3E], the coordination polyhedron becomes
a distorted tetrahedra or a trigonal bipyramid for [LO4E].9 It is common that the lone pairs
help to open up the crystal structures, and such compounds are often
layered with only weak van der Waal interactions between the layers,
or they form three-dimensional framework structures comprising open
voids where the lone pairs reside. When such compounds contain transition
metals, they are very often arranged in the form of chains or layers.10,11

Iodine in the oxidation state +5 adopts a distorted tetrahedral
[IO3E] coordination where the lone pairs help to open up
the structure and increase the chances to form non-centrosymmetric
crystal structures. Iodates have been mainly studied for their optical
properties, and several are SHG active such as the oxides Bi2(IO4)(IO3)3, BiO(IO3),
and BaZr(IO3)6, as well as the oxohalides Bi2Te(IO3)O5Cl, Bi(IO3)F2, and Bi3OF3(IO3)4.12−17 Several iodate compounds containing an alkali metal have also proved
to be SHG active, such as, e.g., A2BiI5O15 (A = K+ or Rb+), AAu(IO3)4 (A = Na, Rb, Cs), KSbI6O18, K2Au(IO3)5, A2Pt(IO3)6 (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs), K2Ti(IO3)6 (A = Li, Na), and Na2Sn(IO3)6.18−24 Some few compounds belonging to the A–M–I5+ O system (M = transition metal) have been previously described.
One such example is K2M2+(IO3)4(H2O)2 (M2+= Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+) reported by
Li et al.25

In this study, the new
compound KCu(IO3)3 is presented together with
its magnetic and vibrational properties.
KCu(IO3)3 has been characterized by Raman scattering,
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), magnetic susceptibility and
heat capacity measurements.

Experimental Section
Light blue
orthorhombic single crystals of the new compound KCu(IO3)3 have been synthesized hydrothermally from 0.101
g (1 mmol) of CuF2 (Aldrich, 99.9%) and 0.642 g (3 mmol)
of KIO3 (Alfa Aesar, 98%). The starting materials were
mixed with 3 mL of deionized water in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave.
The autoclave was heated to 230 °C and maintained there for 72
h and subsequently cooled to room temperature with a cooling rate
of ca 21 °C/h. The pH was ca 5 at the start of synthesis, and
the size of the resulting crystals was mainly in the range 30–100
μm, with some crystals up to 250 μm in size. The synthesis
product was rinsed in warm water and ethanol before drying. This treatment
removed minor remnants of unreacted starting materials, mainly KIO3. After this treatment, the yield was close to 100%. It was
found that lowering the pH to ca 1 by the addition of HF resulted
in smaller crystals and more unreacted starting materials and increasing
the pH to above 10 by adding KOH did not result in the target phase
at all. Smaller crystallites with less developed crystal faces were
obtained if the plateau temperature or the dwell time at the plateau
were reduced. In addition, a faster cooling rate resulted in less
well-developed crystals.

The crystal structure of KCu(IO3)3 was solved
from the single-crystal data collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer
using a Mo Kα radiation; λ = 0.710730Å. The integration
of the Bragg reflections and the absorption correction was done with
software SAINT26 and SADABS,27 respectively, provided by the diffractometer
manufacturer; additional absorption correction was done with the software
Jana 2006.28 The structure was solved by
dual space methods using the software SHELXT-2014/729 and refined by full matrix minimization on F2 using the software Jana 2006 and SHELXL-2014/7.30 The structural drawings were made with program DIAMOND.31 Elemental analysis of crystals was performed
using a scanning electron microscope (HITACHI-TM3000) with an energy-dispersive
spectrometer (Bruker Quantax 70). Powder X-ray diffraction data were
collected with a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer. A scanning
mode between 15θ and 80θ with a 2θ step size of
0.013θ was selected for data collection. Impurity phases were
identified by comparing the powder diffraction pattern with a calculated
pattern from the crystal structure model based on the single-crystal
X-ray data and by peak matching with the ICDD database.32

Raman scattering experiments were performed
on the single crystals
of KCu(IO3)3 with a laser power of P = 1 mW of λ = 532.1 nm radiation and a Raman microscope (LabRam
HR800, Horiba) at ambient conditions. Light polarization was chosen
as parallel (xx) and crossed (xy) polarizations.

The temperature and magnetic field dependence
of the magnetic susceptibilities
was measured with a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMSX7) on
a powder sample. Heat capacity measurements on a powder sample were
performed in a physical property measurement system (Quantum Design,
PPMS) equipped with a 3He closed-cycle refrigerator. The
sample was mixed with Apiezon M vacuum grease to ensure thermal equilibration.
The heat capacities of the calorimeter plate and the vacuum grease
were determined in a preceding measurement and subsequently subtracted
to obtain the total heat capacity of the sample. Electron spin resonance
spectra were collected with a X-band spectrometer (Bruker, EMX control
unit, EMXpremiumX bridge, ERC73 magnet) on the same sample on which
magnetic susceptibility was taken from.

There are three main building
units combined in the crystal structure:
irregular [KO10] polyhedra, Jahn–Teller distorted
[CuO6] octahedra, and [IO3] trigonal pyramids.
To deduce the coordination number for K+ in the structure,
the operational definition by Brown34 was
used where a ligand contributes at least 4% of the valence of the
central cation. This maximum primary bond distance value is 3.3229
Å for K–O. There are ten K–O distances found in
the range 2.678(2)–3.303(2) Å (Supporting Information). These oxygen atoms can then all be considered
to belong to the primary coordination sphere around the K+ ions building the distorted [KO10] polyhedral displayed
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 K+ ion is 10-coordinated by oxygen atoms (red) and forms
[KO10] polyhedra.

The Jahn–Teller distorted [CuO6] octahedra connect
to each other via corner sharing to form [CuO5]∞ zigzag chains along [010] (Figures 2 and 3). The Cu–O distances
are in the range 1.956(2)–2.414(2) Å. Three crystallographically
different iodine atoms, I1, I2, and I3, are found in KCu(IO3)3. The I5+ ions have sterochemically active
lone pairs that force the coordination to be one-sided, resulting
in trigonal pyramids [IO3]. The I–O bond distances
are in the range 1.778(2)–1.843(2) Å, similar to the I–O
observed in I2O5, 1.77(3)–1.95(3) Å.35 The [IO3] trigonal pyramids do not
polymerize and connect to the [CuO5]∞ chains via corner sharing, so each [CuO6] octahedron
is surrounded by six [IO3] trigonal pyramids (Figure 3). The [KO10] polyhedra connect via edge sharing to form dimers and also to two
[CuO6] octahedra of the zigzag chain via face sharing (Figure 4). Furthermore, the
[KO10] polyhedra connect to [I1O3] and [I3O3] via corner sharing and to [I2O3] via edge sharing
(Figure 5).

Figure 2 Crystal structure
of KCu(IO3)3 consists of
[CuO6] octahedra connected to each other to form chains
extending along [010].

Figure 3 [CuO6] octahedra
form [CuO10]∞ zigzag
chains that connect further via corner sharing to [I1O3], [I2O3], and [I3O3].

Figure 4 [KO10] polyhedra (gray) join to form [KO18] dimers
that further connect to two [CuO6] octahedra
in the [CuO10]∞ chains via face sharing.

Figure 5 [KO10] polyhedra connect to [I1O3] and [I3O3] via corner sharing and to [I2O3] via edge sharing.

Several compounds have previously been described
in the K+–M2+–I5+–O
system. The
metal (M2+) cations in the crystal structure of those metal
iodates K2M(IO3)4(H2O)2 (M = Mn, Co, Zn, Mg) adopt octahedral coordination; the I5+ ions have a typical one-sided trigonal pyramid coordination
and K+ has a coordination number of eight. The K–O
bond distance for these compounds range between 2.70(1) and 3.20(1)
Å, the M2+–O distances are in the range 2.018(9)–2.236(4)
Å, and the I–O bond distances are in the range 1.782(9)–1.88(1)
Å;25 thus, they are comparable to
the K–O, Cu–O, and I–O distances observed in
the present compound KCu(IO3)3.

Raman Scattering
Each 4e Wyckoff position of the P21/n (#14) monoclinic structure
leads to 3Ag, 3Bg, 3Au, and 3Bu modes.36 The former two are Raman
active, with Ag showing only diagonal and Bg showing only nondiagonal tensor elements. The latter two are IR
active. As a sum, 42Ag + 42Bg = 84 Raman active
modes may be observed in parallel and crossed polarizations, respectively.

In Figure 6, we
show a representative room-temperature Raman spectrum in (xx) polarization, with x parallel to the crystallographic b axis. Approximately 40 modes are observed in this polarization,
in good agreement with the expected number of modes. Some maxima are
only resolved as shoulders of larger-intensity modes.

Figure 6 Raman spectrum in (xx) polarization at T = 295 K with an axis
break from 525 to 650 cm–1. Bars highlight the grouping
of the modes. The insets zoom into
the data of the first and third group.

The frequency distribution of Raman modes can be separated into
four groups, rationalized by the separation of high-frequency fundamental
vibrational modes from the low-frequency collective lattice modes
as well as the differentiation given by binding strength and distortions
of the structural constituents. Modes within the groups mainly share
the linewidth and frequency splitting. The groups are proposed to
distribute in the frequency ranges 40–180, 200–260,
270–480, and 650–850 cm–1. A zoom
into the low-frequency data in the inset shows that there exist characteristic
frequency splittings. These are approximately 10, 20, and 7 cm–1 for the first three groups. These frequency separations
are attributed to the characteristic binding energies of the local
coordinations involved in the vibrations and the Jahn–Teller
distortions.

We attribute the lower two groups to mainly the
lattice modes involving
I, K, and Cu displacements and the upper two groups to mainly the
bending and stretching modes of [IO3E]. This is in agreement
with previous phonon studies on M(IO3)2, with
M = Ni, Mn, Co, and Zn and related compounds, as well as systematic
tables of vibrational frequencies.37−39

Especially [IO3E] is expected to show phonon fingerprints
as a function of coordination. IO6 with an octahedral coordination
leads to Raman bands at 750 cm–1 with a shift of
15 cm–1 to higher frequencies for a regular octahedron.
Examples can be found in M(IO3)2, with M= Ni,
Mn, Co, and Zn.37 With distortions up to
a pyramidal IO3–, further related modes
exists with frequencies up to 800 cm–1. These correspond
to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations. In contrast,
fundamental bending modes of IO6 and [IO3E]
are expected in the frequency regime of group 3 modes. Corresponding
literature values are in the range 300–450 cm–1.37

Thermal and Magnetic Properties
of KCu(IO3)3
At low temperatures, the
magnetic susceptibility of KCu(IO3)3 (see Figure 7) is characterized
by a broad maximum centered at ∼5.4
K, characteristic for an antiferromagnetic short-range ordering in
a low-dimensional magnetic system. At higher temperatures, the susceptibility
follows an extended Curie–Weiss law (see the inset in Figure 7) according to 1  with
a Curie–Weiss temperature θCW = −4.5(1)
K, indicating a predominant antiferromagnetic
spin-exchange interaction. The Curie–Weiss constant C is given by 2  where NA denotes
Avogadro’s constant and kB is the
Boltzmann constant, μB is the Bohr magneton, and g is the g-factor. For Cu2+ cations
with a 3d9 electronic configuration, the spin S amounts to 1/2. χ0 takes care of a temperature-independent
contribution to the magnetic susceptibility, which is a sum of diamagnetic
contributions from the electrons in the closed shells and a van Vleck
contribution. The diamagnetic contribution can be estimated from the
respective elements in their appropriate oxidation state using the
increments from Selwood’s table.40 They add up to −174 × 10–6 cm3/mol. The van Vleck contribution for Cu2+ cations
depends on the direction of the magnetic field with respect to the
crystal axes, and it typically amounts to approximately 100 ×
10–6 cm3/mol.41 The fit of the inverse magnetic susceptibility data between 20 and
200 K resulted in a g-factor of g = 2.21(3), typical for Cu2+ powder samples42 and a temperature-independent susceptibility
contribution of χ0 = +85(2) × 10–6 cm3/mol.

Figure 7 Molar magnetic susceptibility of KCu(IO3)3 (black circles). The red solid line represents a fit to the
theoretical
results of a spin S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain with a
uniform antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor spin exchange of 8.90(5)
K with a g-factor of 2.204(5) and a temperature-independent
contribution of 103(10) × 10–6 cm3/mol. The inset displays the inverse molar susceptibility with a
fit to an extended Curie–Weiss law for a spin S = 1/2, a g-factor of 2.21(3), a Curie–Weiss
temperature, θCW, of −4.5(1) K, and a paramagnetic
temperature-independent contribution of 85(2) × 10–6 cm3/mol.

The g-factor was independently determined from
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements on
the same powder sample on which the susceptibility data were measured. Figure 8 displays the room-temperature
EPR spectrum collected at a frequency of 9.4873 GHz. One observes
a spectrum typical for a powder with Cu2+ entities in a
Jahn–Teller elongated environment with g-factors g|| > g1,2, where g|| denotes the gyromagnetic ratio with the magnetic
field aligned parallel to the z-axis and g1,2 the g-factors perpendicular
to the z-axis.43

Figure 8 X-band (ν
= 9.480 GHz) room-temperature EPR powder spectrum
of KCu(IO3)3 (blue circles). The red solid line
is a fit assuming an axial symmetry of the g-tensor,
with the two principal values g|| and g⊥.

For the simplicity of simulation, we have assumed an axial symmetry,
i.e., g1 = g2 = g⊥ and a linewidth being independent
of the orientation of the field with respect to the principal axes
of the g-tensor. There are six different Cu-to-O
distances in the primary coordination sphere around the Cu cations.
They are grouped into four ≤1.993(3) Å and two ≥2.344(3)
Å (Supporting Information).

Because of a rather large linewidth of about 120 Oe, further details
of the spectrum could not be resolved and we used a program to fit
the spectrum following the formalism given by Pilbrow.44

The red solid line in Figure 8 displays a fit of the room-temperature
powder EPR
spectrum of KCu(IO3)3 with principal g-factors, g|| = 2.282(2) and g⊥ = 2.163(2), implying a powder-averaged g-factor for the magnetic susceptibility of 3  which is in good agreement with the g-factor determined from the susceptibility measurements.

The
low-temperature magnetic susceptibility could be successfully
fitted assuming a spin S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain with
a uniform nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interaction, Jintra, described by the Hamiltonian 4  The magnetic susceptibility of the S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain with an antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor
spin-exchange interaction has been calculated by transfer-matrix density-matrix
renormalization group and Quantum Monte Carlo calculations to high
precision. Johnston et al. encoded these data into a Padé approximant
that has been used here to fit the experimental data.45 In the least-squares fits, we added again a temperature-independent
susceptibility χ0 and varied the g-factor and the intrachain spin exchange Jintra. Figure 7 (main frame)
displays the best fit, which was achieved by the following parameters: g = 2.204(5), Jintra = 8.90(5)
K, and χ0 = 100(12) × 10–6 cm3/mol.

The g-factor
is in very good agreement with the
EPR data, χ0 is consistent with the value obtained
from the fit of the inverse susceptibility but somewhat larger than
what might be expected from the estimate of the diamagnetic and van
Vleck contribution for a Cu2+ cation in a distorted octahedral
environment (see above).

Assuming a linear chain with z = 2 nearest neighbors,
the Curie–Weiss temperature can be calculated according to 5  matching well the value for θCW found
from the fit of the magnetic susceptibility.

Due to interchain
spin exchange, Jinter, long-range magnetic
ordering sets in at TC = 1.32(5) K, as
is clearly evidenced by a sharp anomaly in the heat
capacity (Figure 9a
(inset)). The interchain spin exchange can be estimated using the
relation in eq 6.46 6  Above the sharp anomaly, short-range order
magnetic contributions to the heat capacity generate a broad maximum
centered at ∼4.5 K. Toward higher temperatures, the lattice
contribution to the heat capacity becomes dominant and the magnetic
contributions are difficult to discern. The magnetic contribution
to the heat capacity was analyzed assuming that the total heat capacity
is a sum of a lattice contribution, Clat(T), which is approximated by a power series 7  with
adjustable coefficients β and δ
and a magnetic contribution, Cchain, which
above TC was approximated by the heat
capacity of a spin S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain with
a uniform nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interaction, Cchain(T). The total heat capacity was
subsequently fitted to 8  where
the Padé approximation by Johnston
et al.45 was used for Cchain(T).

Figure 9 (a) Magnetic contribution, Cmag(T)/T,
to the heat capacity of KCu(IO3)3 (black circles).
The red solid line represents
the heat capacity of a spin S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain
with a uniform antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor spin exchange of
8.71(2) K. The inset displays the total heat capacity. The blue dashed
line indicates the lattice contribution to the heat capacity, which
has been subtracted from the total heat capacity. The lattice contribution
was approximated by a polynomial, Clatt(T) = βT3 + δT5, with coefficients β and δ given
in the text. (b) Temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy obtained
by integrating Cmag(T)/T (black circles). The inset shows the magnetic
entropy next to the Néel temperature marked by the vertical
red arrow. About 12% of the magnetic entropy is recovered below the
Néel temperature.

Figure 9a (inset)
displays the fit of the total heat capacity between 2 and 20 K. The
main frame in Figure 9a shows the magnetic contribution to the heat capacity, Cchain(T)/T, obtained
after subtraction of the lattice contribution together with a fit
to the Padé approximant for the S = 1/2 Heisenberg
chain. The nearest-neighbor spin-exchange parameter obtained from
this fit amounts to Jintra = 8.71(9) K,
in best agreement with the exchange parameter derived from the susceptibility
data (see above).

The magnetic entropy released during magnetic
short- and long-range
order, shown in Figure 9b, was obtained by integrating Cchain(T)/T versus T. The total entropy comes close to R ln2 expected for the ordering
of a spin S = 1/2 system. About 12% of the entropy is released by the long-range
ordering below TC = 1.32 K. The coefficient
β is related to the Debye temperature θDebye(T → 0) via eq 9 9  where R is the molar gas
constant and n = 14 is the number of atoms per formula
unit. Using the fitted parameter for β, the Debye temperature
becomes θDebye(0) = 225(1) K.

In summary, the
magnetic properties of KCu(IO3)3 are well described
by that of a spin S =
1/2 Heisenberg chain with antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor spin-exchange
interaction of ∼9 K. Interchain spin exchange is about a factor
of 20 smaller and drives KCu(IO3)3 to a long-range
antiferromagnetic order below ∼1.3 K. A linear chain magnetism
may be suspected from the crystal structure featuring the Jahn–Teller
elongated CuO6 octahedra connected via corners. A closer
inspection of the distortion geometry of the oxygen octahedra, however,
reveals that the linear spin lattice more likely results from super–superexchange
via a pair of oxygen atoms labeled O1, O3, O6, and O9 in Figure 10, respectively.
With distances to the central Cu atom between 1.95 and 2.00 Å,
these oxygen atoms form the equatorial plane of the Jahn–Teller
elongated oxygen octahedra such that the half-filled 3dx–2y2 orbitals can effectively overlap with the
oxygen 2p orbitals.

Figure 10 Projection of a section of the crystal structure of KCu(IO3)3 along [302] showing Cu atoms in blue and O and
I atoms in red and yellow, respectively. Only those oxygen atoms of
the Jahn–Teller elongated octahedra are plotted with distances
to the central Cu atom below 2 Å highlighting the putative super–superexchange
spin exchange paths via oxygen pairs also coordinating the I5+ cations.

Conclusions
The
new iodate, KCu(IO3)3, has been synthesized
by employing a hydrothermal technique with CuF2 and KIO3 as starting compounds. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data
were used for the structure determination. The compound crystallizes
in the centro-symmetric space group P21/n with the unit cell parameters a = 9.8143(4) Å, b = 8.2265(4) Å, c = 10.8584(5) Å, and β = 91.077(2)°. The
structure contains the Jahn–Teller elongated [CuO6] octahedra that connects to each other via corner sharing to form
isolated chains. Three types of [IO3] triagonal pyramids
connect to the chains via corner sharing. Dimers of edge-sharing [KO10] distorted polyhedra are further linked to the chain via
face sharing.

Using Raman scattering, a separation of phonon
modes into groups
with characteristic frequencies has been observed. Low and high frequencies
are attributed to the collective lattice modes and high-frequency
fundamental modes, respectively. The observed total number of modes
and their frequency fully support the given structure description.

The magnetic properties of KCu(IO3)3 are
well-described by that of a linear spin S = 1/2 Heisenberg
chain with an antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor spin exchange interaction
of ∼9 K. The interchain spin exchange is smaller by about a
factor of 20, causing a long-range antiferromagnetic order below ∼1.3
K. The linear spin lattice appears to result from super–superexchange
via two oxygen anions coordinating simultaneously to the Cu2+ and the I5+ cations.
