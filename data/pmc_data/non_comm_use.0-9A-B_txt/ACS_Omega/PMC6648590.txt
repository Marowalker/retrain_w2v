The synthesis of a new functional
group in the form of selenyl-substituted
aziridines is described. Selenoaziridines are stereoselectively prepared
by functionalization of intact aziridine precursors involving radical
and anionic intermediates. Radicals are generated from cis-N-Ts iodoaziridines by activation of the C–I
bond using alkoxides as a source of single electrons. These form predominantly trans-substituted selenoaziridines dependent on the size
of the diselenide. cis-Aziridinyllithiums generated
by Li–I exchange also react with diselenides stereospecifically
to form a range of cis-selenoaziridines. Proposals
for the stereochemical outcome are presented.

Introduction
Aziridines are widely
regarded as valuable synthetic intermediates
in organic synthesis.1 The ring strain
inherent in the three-membered ring makes them reactive as electrophiles
in stereocontrolled ring opening processes to generate N-containing compounds.2,3 In addition, the small ring structure
confers a structural fascination, which has led to numerous studies
into new aziridine derivatives and their reactivity in a wide variety
of chemistry. A variety of heteroatom-substituted aziridines have
been developed, which have afforded further diverse reactivity.4

There has been a considerable interest
in the functionalization
of intact aziridines as a divergent strategy to prepare aziridine
derivatives.5−15 Predominantly, this has been achieved via the generation of aziridinyl
anions and trapping with highly reactive electrophiles.5 Early studies from Beak demonstrated the viability
to deprotonate N-Boc aziridines.6 More recently, Hodgson developed stereoselective reaction
of terminal aziridines with strong lithium amide bases in a regio-
and stereoselective fashion using N-Bus aziridines
and a range of electrophiles at low temperature.7 Installation of the electrophilic moiety occurs trans to the alkyl group on the ring. In contrast, Florio
and co-workers have demonstrated that aromatic substituted N-Bus aziridines undergo benzylic deprotonation, resulting
in the formation of terminal disubstituted aziridines, after trapping
with suitable electrophiles.8 Functional
group exchange leading to unstabilized aziridinyl metal species, as
well as trapping with electrophiles, has also been effective as an
approach to intact aziridine functionalization, with leading works
from Satoh,9 Vedejs,10 and Aggarwal.11 We recently
disclosed a route to cis-substituted N-Ts aziridines via a stereospecific Li–I exchange/electrophilic
trapping protocol using N-Ts iodoaziridines.12,13 The generation of aziridinyl metal species via functional group
exchange has enabled the development of aziridinyl palladium-catalyzed
cross-coupling, as reported recently by ourselves14 and Vedejs.15

On the other
hand, the functionalization of aziridines via formation
of aziridinyl radical species has received far less attention. Most
notable approaches to C-centered aziridinyl radical species have been
demonstrated by Ziegler (Scheme 1b), forming bromoaziridines (4:1 cis/trans) via a Barton decarboxylation bromination
sequence from aziridine carboxylates, in the synthesis of mitomycin-like
antitumor agents.16 Yamanaka has also demonstrated
the formation of halogenated aziridines via aziridinyl radical intermediates.17 Selective reduction of 2,2-dihalogenated aziridines
with H-SnBu3 through a radical chain reaction affords the
dehalogenated aziridine via a carbon-centered radical species.

Scheme 1 (a–c) Approaches to the Functionalization of Intact Aziridines
Involving (a) Aziridinyllithium and (b) Aziridinyl Radical Intermediates
and (c) This Work
We were interested in the generation of aziridinyl radicals
from
iodoaziridines to investigate the formation and reactivity of these
radical species. We chose to investigate this through the formation
of C-selenoaziridines, a novel functional group,
which we also expected to allow facile interpretation of the stereochemical
outcome. In particular, we envisaged the use of KOtBu as a source of electrons to reduce the iodoaziridine and form
the intermediate aziridinyl radical. Alkoxide bases in combination
with simple alcohols/amine ligands have been used for the generation
of radical species in metal-free cross-coupling reaction.18−20 KOtBu, in particular, has been shown to provide
weakly solvated electrons and be sufficient to promote biaryl cross-coupling
reactions in the presence of an aryl halide and benzene.21

Here, we report studies into the synthesis
of selenium-substituted
aziridine derivatives. Selenoaziridine derivatives with cis- and trans-substitution are accessed stereoselectively
via aziridinyllithium species and aziridinyl radicals, both generated
from iodoaziridines. This involves a new approach to the preparation
of aziridinyl radicals, generating the radical species from iodoaziridines
by a single electron transfer from KOtBu to functionalize
the intact aziridine.

Results and Discussion
N-Ts iodoaziridines 1–4 were prepared
in gram quantities from simple imines according
to our previously reported protocols and formed exclusively as their cis-diastereoisomers (Scheme 2).13 For alkyl-substituted N-Ts imines, the diiodomethylmagnesium reagent was used,
formed by exchange of ethylmagnesium chloride with iodoform.13d For the phenyl imine, LiCHI2 was
suitable, formed by the deprotonation of diiodomethyllithium with
LiHMDS.22

Scheme 2 Diastereoselective
Synthesis of N-Ts Iodoaziridines
via Addition of Diiodomethylmagnesium Chloride or Diiodomethyllithium
to N-Ts Imines
To establish the viability of the selenoaziridine functional
group,
we first applied our lithiation and trapping protocol to the synthesis
of cis-substituted selenoaziridines.12 Pleasingly, this could be achieved for selenides through
treatment of iodoaziridine 1 with nBuLi
and reaction with diphenyldiselenide. Low temperatures were required
for the stability of the intermediate aziridinyl lithium species,
which is formed and reacts very rapidly. Re-evaluation of the reaction
conditions allowed a reduction of the amount of diselenide used to
1 equiv (Scheme 3)
to afford selenoaziridine cis-5a in
high yield as a single cis-diastereoisomer. Interestingly,
the lithium phenylselenide generated as the by-product of Ph2Se2 reacts preferentially with the nBuI
generated through the exchange process. This protects the aziridine
products from potential further ring opening reactions or from undesired
alkylation reactions.

Scheme 3 Formation of cis-Selenoaziridine 5a by Stereospecific Lithiation/Trapping of Aziridinyl Lithiums
with
Diphenyl Diselenide
The scope of this reaction was then explored varying both
the diselenide
and iodoaziridine (Scheme 4), with cis-selenoaziridines being formed
exclusively in all cases, as supported by coupling constants, on the
analysis of the 1H NMR spectra of the crude product (e.g.,
for selenoaziridine cis-5a, δ
4.26 ppm, J = 6.8 Hz for CHSePh; cf. J = 4–5 Hz for typical trans-substitution).
Employing (1) diphenyl diselenide or (2) dibenzyl diselenide as the
electrophile gave similar results with each of the iodoaziridines.
Trapping the corresponding aziridinyllithium species afforded cis-selenoaziridines 5–8 in high yields. Both secondary alkyl and phenyl iodoaziridines were
tolerated, affording the corresponding selenoaziridines, which were
stable to silica gel chromatography. The sterically hindered tert-butyl-substituted iodoaziridine also gave rise to exclusively
the cis-substituted selenoaziridines 7, implying very high stereochemical fidelity in the exchange process.
Competing dehalogenation of iodoaziridine 4, arising
from protonation of the highly reactive aziridinyllithium intermediate
to give 2-phenyl-1-tosylaziridine, led to slightly reduced yields
for selenoaziridines 8a and 8b. Attempts
at trapping the highly reactive aziridinyllithium species arising
from Li–I exchange on iodoaziridine 1 with Se2Me2 resulted in poor conversion to the desired cis-selenoaziridine (<5% conversion by 1H
NMR) under the optimized reaction conditions, with the major product
being the protodehalogenated aziridine after 5 min.

Scheme 4 Formation of cis-Selenoaziridines via Stereospecific
Lithiation/Trapping of Aziridinyl Lithiums with Diselenides
Reaction conditions: nBuLi (1.5 equiv), THF (0.065 M), −100 °C, addition
of aziridine (0.27 mmol) in THF, 5 s; then, diselenide (1.0 equiv),
THF, −100 °C, 5 min.

Contained 2-phenyl-1-(tosyl)aziridine as an inseparable
impurity (7% yield).

Contained 2-phenyl-1-(tosyl)aziridine as an inseparable impurity
(6% yield).

Yield calculated
on the basis of desired product only.

We then
examined the formation of an aziridinyl radical species
directly from iodoaziridine 1, aiming to avoid the low
temperature conditions (−100 °C) required for functionalization
through lithiation. This also posed a question on the stereochemical
outcome of the reaction related to the structural properties and facial
preference of an N-Ts-C-alkyl-C-aziridine radical. After initial investigations, we found
that KOtBu in iPrOH at 60 °C
was suitable to generate the desired aziridinyl radical, and in the
presence of diphenyldiselenide, a selenoaziridine product 5a was formed in 53% yield as a mixture of isomers with the trans-isomer predominating (7.1:1 trans/cis; Table 1, entry 1).
This was supported by coupling constants in the 1H NMR
spectra (for selenoaziridine trans-5a, δ 3.86 ppm, J = 4.5 Hz for CHSePh). Various
solvent combinations were explored using KOtBu as
the SET promoter, with a selection of our optimization shown below
in Table 1 (entries
1–4), including those successfully demonstrated in the literature. iPrOH was found to be superior to other solvents examined,
both in terms of yield of selenoaziridine 5a and diastereoselectivity.
Small quantities of gem-diselenide 9 were also observed, resulting from aziridine ring opening, presumably
from opening of the selenoaziridine product. Using iPrOH, we next began to examine other group 1 metal alkoxides and
bases. The use of NaOEt was unreactive and led to almost quantitative
return of starting iodoaziridine 1 under the reaction
conditions. Kappe has shown that LiHMDS can be used in place of KOtBu to affect the direct arylation of benzene with aryl
bromides in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline.23 Iodoaziridine 1 was subjected to the reaction
conditions in the presence of NaHMDS, which led to the desired formation
of selenoaziridine 5a but in reduced yields to KOtBu/iPrOH (entry 6). Chan has demonstrated
that cesium alkoxides can be employed in transition metal-free cross-coupling
of benzene with aryl halides.24 However,
cesium carbonate in combination with iPrOH also led
to reduced yields of selenoaziridine 5a, although an
increased dr (8.7:1) was observed (entry 7).

After extensive further study, conditions using KOtBu (1.6 equiv) and iPrOH at 0.1 M substrate concentration
were chosen as optimal to generate the desired reactive aziridinyl
radical species from iodoaziridine 1 and trap with diphenyl
diselenide in good yield and dr for 5a (Table 2, entry 1).
A full study into the time/temperature profile of the reaction was
undertaken, indicating that rapid formation of the desired selenoaziridine
mixture was occurring at elevated temperatures. Prolonged reaction
times led to either degradation of the selenoaziridine mixture to p-toluenesulfonamide or increased amounts of aziridine ring
opening affording amino gem-diselenide 9. The best results were obtained from a very short reaction time
(15 min) at a higher temperature (70 °C). Table 2 presents selected examples of important
factors to influence the yield of the reaction. Reducing the reaction
temperature to room temperature (RT; entry 2) afforded a considerable
drop in yield, showing the enhanced ability of KOtBu to act as a single electron transfer agent at elevated temperatures.18 A range of alcohols were then explored. Primary
alcohols gave poorer conversions and lower yields of selenoaziridine 5a. Changing the solvent to tBuOH and employing
it in a 1:1 mixture with iPrOH had no major impact
on yield but led to a reduction in dr (entries 5
and 6). Using degassed but nonanhydrous iPrOH had
no effect on both yield and overall dr (entry 7).
In the absence of solvent (performing the reaction with neat solid
reagents), a respectable 23% yield for selenoaziridine 5a is observed (entry 8). A reduction in equivalents of KOtBu to 1.0 equiv led to reduced conversion, whereas an increase to
2.0 equiv led to the formation of more unwanted aziridine ring-opened
products, including bis-ethers (derived from alkoxide ring opening)
and p-toluenesulfonamide (entries 9 and 10). Crucially,
in the absence of a base, quantitative return of iodoaziridine 1 was observed (entry 11).

c dr calculated from 1H NMR spectra of crude product mixtures.

d Isolated yield.

Whereas the cis-selenoaziridines
prepared via
Li–I exchange/diselenide trapping were stable to conventional
silica gel chromatography, it became quickly apparent that the dr of the isolated product mixture did not match that obtained
from the crude 1H NMR spectra of the reaction. To rapidly
assess the stability of our products to a wide range of stationary
phases, we utilized a protocol we have recently developed.13b,13c Taking a mixture of selenoaziridine 5a (trans/cis = 2.5:1) in the presence of a known amount
of internal standard, we subjected the mixture to a range of stationary
phases, modeling the experience of a compound during a conventional
chromatography procedure including the choice of eluents and the time
required for purification. Slurries of various stationary phases were
prepared in 10% Et2O/hexane, and samples of selenoaziridine 5a (trans/cis = 2.5:1) were
subjected to these conditions, filtering off the stationary phase
after 30 min and analyzing the filtrate by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
In comparison to the 1H NMR spectrum of the starting crude
product sample (Table 3, entry 1) and control (entry 2, eluent only), a significant reduction
in dr was observed when treating with varying stationary
phases. Silica gel, base-doped silica gel, and neutral alumina (entries
3–5) showed a significant reduction in dr.
Exposure to basic alumina (activity I) appeared to degrade the selenoaziridine,
with a poor recovery observed for the mixture, and, in addition, epimerized
the starting selenoaziridine mixture from a 2.5:1 (trans/cis) mixture to a 1:1 mixture. On the other hand,
by using deactivated basic alumina (activity IV), the mixture retained
the starting dr and showed quantitative recovery
of the material (entry 7). Pleasingly, using column chromatography
on basic alumina (activity IV) enables us to reduce the levels of
epimerization observed with silica gel and isolate trans-selenoaziridine 5a in a 52% yield (dr = 5.4:1, trans/cis; c.f. silica
gel, dr = 4:1). As a consequence, basic alumina (activity
IV) was used for the purification of the trans-selenoaziridines.

The scope of the reaction was
then investigated by varying iodoaziridine
and diselenide (Scheme 5). Under the standard reaction conditions, with purification on deactivated
basic alumina (activity IV), the reaction showed good tolerance for
the formation of secondary alkyl-substituted aziridinyl seleno-ethers 5a and 6a in good yield and dr, closely resembling the dr observed in the crude 1H NMR mixture. Reaction of the tert-butyl-substituted
iodoaziridine 3 and diphenyl diselenide resulted in the
exclusive formation of the trans-substituted selenoaziridine trans-7a in excellent yield. Interestingly,
submission of Ph-substituted iodoaziridine 4 under the
standard conditions afforded only 5% yield of a mixture of selenoaziridines
(by 1H NMR). Attempts at lowering the reaction temperature
led to reduced yields and increased amounts of unreacted iodoaziridine 4. We postulated that the high reaction temperatures were
leading to radical-induced thermal decomposition of the iodoaziridine,
but submission to the standard conditions in the absence of KOtBu led to quantitative recovery of iodoaziridine 4, showing the requirement of KOtBu to generate
the aziridinyl radical species. Poor conversion was also observed
with primary substituted iodoaziridines. On changing diselenide to
dimethyl diselenide, a reversal in diastereoselectivity was observed
for secondary substituted iodoaziridines 1 and 2, forming exclusively the cis-substituted
selenoaziridines cis-5c and cis-6c, respectively, in good yields. Employing tert-butyl-substituted iodoaziridine 3 resulted
in the formation of a 1.2:1 mixture (trans/cis) of selenoaziridine 7c.

Scheme 5 Formation of Selenoaziridines
via KOtBu-Mediated
Radical Formation and Trapping with Diselenides
Reaction conditions: aziridine
(0.27 mmol), KOtBu (1.6 equiv), diselenide (2.0 equiv), iPrOH 0.10 M, RT (10 min) to 70 °C (15 min).

dr calculated from 1H NMR spectra of crude product.

Mechanistically,
in agreement with the work of Wilden21b and Ashby,21e we
propose that the KOtBu acts as a single electron
transfer reagent. We propose that an electron from the t-butoxide
reduces the weak C–I bond, generating the iodoaziridine radical
anion (Scheme 6). Elimination
of iodide would form the aziridinyl radical intermediate. Attack of
the radical at diphenyl diselenide would afford the selenoaziridine.

Scheme 6 Proposed Mechanism for trans-Selenoaziridine Formation
from cis-Iodoaziridines
An alternative mechanism, not via the aziridinyl radical,
would
involve a phenylselenate anion acting as a nucleophile by either (1)
SN2 reaction on the aziridine ring to displace iodide,25 expected to be unlikely on NTs derivatives,
or (2) ring opening and ring closure displacing iodide. To address
this, we ran control experiments by generating PhSeNa from diphenyldiselenide
and sodium borohydride, with varying equivalents, and then heating
in the presence of the iodoaziridine (70 °C, 15 min) under conditions
related to those optimized above. In these experiments, only trace
amounts of selenoaziridine product were observed, with significant
amounts of recovered iodoaziridines and other ring-opened products,
including gem-diselenide 9. Iodoaziridine 1 was unreactive to sodium borohydride alone under these conditions.

On this basis, we analyze the stereoselectivity on the basis of
a radical intermediate. Using iodoaziridines 1–3 with diphenyl diselenide gave high or exclusive trans-selectivity. This can be rationalized as the bulky
Ph2Se2 approaching from the opposite side to
the alkyl substituent. This suggests a planarization of the N-Ts group to permit the N-lone pair of electrons to aid
in stabilizing the radical, reducing the steric crowding on the lower
face as drawn (Scheme 6). Surprisingly, the Me2Se2 reagent is cis-selective with the same substrates, except for the larger tBu derivative that is a mixture. We rationalize this on
the basis of the reduced steric demands of the diselenide and enabling
the formation of the cis product, which is assumed
to be thermodynamically preferred, given the epimerization observed
on silica. This is less viable on the even larger tBu derivative, which gives increased trans-product.

Conclusions
This work further extends the reactivity of the unusual iodoaziridine
functional group in the synthesis of selenoaziridines via anionic
and radical intermediates. Lithium–iodine exchange occurs with
high stereochemical fidelity, and trapping of aziridinyllithium intermediates
with diselenides provides cis-selenoaziridines. The
generation of aziridinyl radical species using alkoxides is shown
to be viable. Indeed, via radical intermediates, the same cis-iodoaziridines will preferentially form the trans-selenoaziridines upon reaction with diphenyldiselenide.
The stereochemical outcome is rationalized on the basis of minimizing
steric interactions. On the other hand, the use of the smaller Me2Se2 reagent affords the thermodynamically preferred cis-selenoaziridine product.

Experimental Section
Reactions were performed in flame-dried glassware under argon using
standard techniques and in anhydrous solvents (THF, diethyl ether,
and CH2Cl2) obtained by filtration through drying
columns. Flash column chromatography used 230–400 mesh silica
or 50–200 μm Brockmann basic alumina (activity IV) with
the indicated solvent system. Infrared spectra (FTIR ATR) were recorded
in reciprocal centimeters (cm–1), and major absorptions
are reported. Chemical shifts for 1H NMR spectra (400 MHz)
are recorded with the residual protic solvent resonance as the internal
standard (chloroform, δ = 7.27 ppm). Data is reported as follows:
chemical shift [multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet,
m = multiplet, and br = broad), coupling constant in Hz, integration,
assignment]. 13C NMR spectra were recorded with complete
proton decoupling and are reported with the solvent resonance as the
internal standard (13CDCl3: 77.0 ppm). 19F NMR spectra are reported in parts per million referenced
to monofluorobenzene (−113.5 ppm) and were recorded with complete
proton decoupling. Melting points are uncorrected.

Exchange and Trapping: General
Procedure A
Separate syringes containing the appropriate
iodoaziridine (1–4, 0.27 mmol, 1.0
equiv) in THF (0.5 mL) and selenide (0.27 mmol, 1.0 equiv) were positioned
into a 25 mL round-bottom flask containing THF (6.0 mL) at RT, sealed
with a Suba-Seal. The flask was cooled to −100 °C in a
liquid N2/Et2O bath (external bath temperature),
and then nBuLi (0.41 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added in
one portion. The resulting solution was further cooled to −102
°C (external bath temperature) for a further 3 min. The aziridine
solution was then added dropwise down the side of the flask over 30
s, maintaining the external bath temperature at −102 °C.
After 5 s, the selenide was added in one portion, and the bath was
warmed to −100 °C. After 5 min at −100 °C,
the reaction was quenched by the addition of saturated aqueous sodium
bicarbonate solution (10 mL) and then removed from the bath. Once
at RT, the aqueous solution was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 20 mL), and the organic extracts were combined,
dried (Na2SO4), and filtered. In addition, the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Purification by flash
chromatography afforded the cis-selenoaziridine.

To a
flame-dried 10 mL vial, the appropriate iodoaziridine (0.27 mmol,
1.0 equiv) and diselenide (0.54 mmol, 1.0 equiv) were added, which
were taken into a N2-filled glove box. KOtBu (49.2 mg, 0.44 mmol, 1.6 equiv) was added, and the reaction vial
was sealed under nitrogen with a Teflon cap. The vial was then taken
outside of the glove box, and degassed 2-propanol (2.7 mL) was added.
The reaction was then stirred at RT for 10 min and transferred to
an oil bath at 70 °C. After 15 min, the reaction mixture was
cooled to 0 °C and filtered through a pad of silica (3 cm ×
1 cm) eluting with EtOAc (4 × 10 mL), and the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure. Purification by flash chromatography on deactivated
basic alumina (activity IV) afforded the appropriate selenoaziridine.
