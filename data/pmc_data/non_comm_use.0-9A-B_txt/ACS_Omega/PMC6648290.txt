We use transient electrical measurements
to investigate the details
of self-heating and charge trapping in graphene transistors encapsulated
in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and operated under strongly nonequilibrium
conditions. Relative to more standard devices fabricated on SiO2 substrates, encapsulation is shown to lead to an enhanced
immunity to charge trapping, the influence of which is only apparent
under the combined influence of strong gate and drain electric fields.
Although the precise source of the trapping remains to be determined,
one possibility is that the strong gate field may lower the barriers
associated with native defects in the h-BN, allowing them to mediate
the capture of energetic carriers from the graphene channel. Self-heating
in these devices is identified through the observation of time-dependent
variations of the current in graphene and is found to be described
by a time constant consistent with expectations for nonequilibrium
phonon conduction into the dielectric layers of the device. Overall,
our results suggest that h-BN-encapsulated graphene devices provide
an excellent system for implementations in which operation under strongly
nonequilibrium conditions is desired.

Introduction
The capacity to implement layered heterostructures
by stacking
different combinations of atomically flat materials has opened up
new opportunities in recent years for the realization of various functional
devices.1 One of the primary examples of
such a “van der Waals heterostructure” is provided by
the graphene/h-BN system in which a conductive graphene sheet is sandwiched
between layers of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).2−6 A schematic illustration of this system is shown
in Figure 1a, which
indicates the main components of a field-effect transistor (FET) that
is formed by encapsulating a thin graphene sheet (green) between two
thicker layers of h-BN (blue). (Also indicated in this figure is an
equivalent thermal circuit that we will use later on to analyze the
transient dynamics of heating in such devices.) Hexagonal boron nitride
is a wide-gap semiconductor with an indirect gap of ∼6 eV7 and a number of properties that make it compatible
for integration with graphene. It is easily realized in atomically
flat form and has a honeycomb crystal structure that is well matched
(∼1.5% mismatch) to that of graphene.8 It is not plagued by the interfacial dangling bonds or the bulk
oxide traps, which tend to be present in SiO2 and which
are the source of hysteretic operation and hot-carrier trapping in
graphene-on-SiO2 devices. Finally, the thermal conductivity
of h-BN is about 20 times larger than that of SiO2, allowing
it to function as an efficient heat sink in graphene/h-BN heterostructures.8

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration of the structure of the graphene/h-BN
heterostructured FETs investigated here. The significance of the different
thermal resistances () and capacitances
(C)
is discussed in the main text. On the right of the image, we show
a thermal-resistance model that can be used to address self-heating
in these FETs. Superscripts “U” and
“L” denote the upper and lower layers
of h-BN, respectively, while “sub”
refers to the SiO2/Si substrate. (b) Representation of
the different energy-exchange processes that are expected to arise
in these devices when they are subjected to a large electric field.
The horizontal scale represents time following the turn-on of the
electric field that, for the purpose of discussion, is assumed to
occur instantaneously (at time t = 0).

van der Waals heterostructures composed of graphene
and h-BN have
recently become popular for the investigation of exotic condensed-matter
phenomena manifested at low temperatures (∼1 K) where the suppression
of electron–phonon scattering allows very high carrier mobilities
[>105 cm2/(V·s)] to be achieved.9−13 Far fewer studies,14−16 in contrast, have addressed the nature of hot-carrier
transport in these structures, in spite of the fact that this transport
is most pertinent to active-device applications. It is this problem
we explore in this research article in which we apply pulsed electrical
measurements to determine the dynamics of energy transfer in graphene/h-BN
FETs. The key result we demonstrate is significant immunity of transistor
action to hot-carrier trapping, providing a marked improvement over
graphene-on-SiO2 devices, whose operation is known to be
negatively impacted by such trapping at high fields.17−23 We also identify the dynamics of self-heating in the graphene/h-BN
devices and discuss how this influences transistor performance. Overall,
our results establish the excellent immunity of the graphene/h-BN
system to hot-carrier degradation and highlight its value as a specific
materials combination for the realization of active devices.

Before describing the results of our study, it is worthwhile first
clarifying the different hot-carrier phenomena that can arise when
graphene FETs are subjected to a large driving electric field. These
phenomena are represented in Figure 1b, along with the various timescales on which they
are expected to develop. The key subcomponents of the system here
are the mobile carriers and phonons of the graphene layer and the
phonons of the insulating h-BN and of the supporting (SiO2/Si) substrate. Prior to turning on the electric field, these various
subsystems can be assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at a common
ambient temperature (Tamb = Te = TL, where Te is the carrier temperature in graphene and TL is the lattice temperature in the various layers). Once
the field is applied, the carriers first thermalize at an effective
“hot” temperature (Te > TL = Tamb) in a process
involving a combination of Auger scattering and band-to-band recombination.
As indicated in Figure 1b, the characteristic time associated with this thermalization ranges
from tens of femtoseconds to a few picoseconds.24 Following this, there is a slower exchange of energy from
the hot carriers to the intrinsic phonons of graphene on an “energy-relaxation
time” that may vary from picoseconds to nanoseconds, dependent
upon temperature and carrier concentration.25 While both the carrier thermalization and the subsequent electron–phonon
energy exchange are “internal” to the graphene, further
time-dependent character arises from the exchange of energy between
the graphene and the surrounding dielectric layers.26,27 This much slower process (commonly referred to as “self-heating”)
is not instantaneous but is governed instead by the thermal resistance
of these layers (, including
the interfacial resistance that
arises from phonon mismatch between the layers28) and their associated thermal capacities (C). Thermal-transport simulations,26 performed
for graphene-on-SiO2, have shown that this process may
take as long as hundreds of nanoseconds before the system reaches
full steady state. With this state achieved, the carrier temperature
(Te) in graphene may easily exceed 1000
K,28 while the lattice temperature in the
dielectric layers rises by hundreds of kelvin above ambient temperature
(TL ≫ Tamb).26

Added to the role of the heating
processes described above is the
influence of carrier trapping. As noted already, this is known to
be especially problematic for graphene-on-SiO2 devices,
due to a preponderance of possible trapping sites in the oxide system.
In this research article, we make use of time-resolved electrical
measurements to demonstrate that the graphene/h-BN system exhibits
significantly enhanced immunity to carrier trapping relative to graphene-on-SiO2 devices. This can be traced directly to the reduced presence
of trapping centers in the insulating h-BN.

Results
In this
study, we use a rapid-pulsing approach17,18 to investigate
(at room temperature) the hot-carrier action in h-BN-encapsulated
graphene FETs, comparing this with the corresponding behavior exhibited
by graphene-on-SiO2 devices. A full description of these
devices and of the different measurement techniques used to characterize
them is given in the Methods section at the
end of this article. In the h-BN-encapsulated devices, which were
fabricated by a dry-transfer approach (Methods), a small graphene flake was encapsulated between two thick layers
of h-BN, providing isolation from an underlying SiO2 substrate.
The carrier concentration in these devices was controlled by means
of a top gate (see Figure 2), whose dielectric was formed by the upper h-BN layer.

Figure 2 Schematic illustration
of the pulsed-measurement scheme. The optical
micrograph shows the active region of the device, outlining the lower
(blue dotted line) and upper (red dotted line) h-BN flakes that encapsulate
a small flake of bilayer graphene (black dotted line). The source–drain
separation in this device is 0.5 μm.

The essential principle of our pulsed measurements is illustrated
in Figure 2. This shows
how a short voltage pulse (of amplitude Vp, duration T, and rise time tr) is applied repetitively (at a frequency fr) to the source line (“In”, Figure 2) of a microwave graphene FET.
The signal is sourced via an on-chip coplanar waveguide designed to
provide 50 Ω matching to the graphene.17 A 50 Ω ruthenium oxide resistor ensures a matched termination
on the input line (see Figure 2), and the resulting transient current that flows to the drain
is measured by feeding this line (“Out”, Figure 2) into the 50 Ω input
of a real-time oscilloscope. The pulse duration used in our experiments
was varied from 25 ns to 100 μs, while the repetition frequency
could be set in the range of 10 kHz–1 MHz. Through variation
of these parameters, we were able to distinguish and fully investigate
the role of self-heating and hot-carrier trapping in the devices.

We start by assessing the differences in behavior exhibited by
the graphene/h-BN and graphene-on-SiO2 devices under linear
operation. Here, a small dc voltage (∼mV) is applied to generate
a drain current, the variation of which is measured while sweeping
the gate voltage that controls the carrier concentration in the channel.
In Figure 3, we show
that, for the graphene-on-SiO2 device, such an experiment
generates significant hysteresis when sweeping the gate voltage in
opposite directions. This behavior is well known for devices formed
on SiO2, in which it is typically attributed to the charging
of interfacial states and of deep traps in the oxide layer.21,23,29−33 In marked contrast, the corresponding measurement
for a graphene-encapsulated device shows no measurable hysteresis,
suggesting that both of these charging mechanisms are suppressed when
h-BN is used as the graphene substrate. It should be noted here that,
in spite of the very different sweep ranges employed in these measurements,
the corresponding variations of carrier concentration are quite similar
for the two devices. For the BN-encapsulated device, variation of
the top-gate voltage from −20 to 0 V corresponds to a respective
change from 2.0 × 1012 holes cm–2 to 1.2 × 1012 electrons cm–2.
Similarly, for the graphene-on-SiO2 FET, the back-gate
voltage range (of 0 to 60 V) implies a change from 2.9 × 1012 holes cm–2 to 1.4 × 1012 electrons cm–2. In both of the devices, the maximum
range of the gate voltage sweep was limited by the need to minimize
gate-current leakage. It is also noted that the relative change of
resistance is smaller for the BN-encapsulated device; this most likely
reflects the influence of contact resistance in the two-probe geometry
that is required17 for our pulsed measurements
(the graphene-on-SiO2 device, on the other hand, was measured
in a four-probe configuration).

Figure 3 Comparison of hysteresis in the transfer
curves of graphene-on-SiO2 (right vertical scale) and h-BN-encapsulated
(monolayer graphene,
left vertical scale) FETs. The gate voltage sweep direction is indicated
by the arrows in the figure, and the measurements were performed by
applying a dc drain bias of 25 mV to both devices. For the graphene/h-BN
heterostructure, filled symbols are plotted to indicate the extent
to which the transfer curve shows no measurable hysteresis. Gate voltage
sweep rates were 200 and 100 mV/s for the h-BN-encapsulated and graphene-on-SiO2 devices, respectively.

While the results of Figure 3 point to the absence of charging effects in h-BN-encapsulated
graphene FETs, it is important to stress that these results were obtained
for small-signal operation (average drain fields ∼V/cm). Consequently,
they do not address the question of whether such effects can be expected
to appear when these devices are operated under the hot-carrier conditions
that are more pertinent to practical device operation. For an answer
to this question, we study how the pulsed current–voltage characteristics
of the devices vary as a function of pulse duration. In the inset
to Figure 4, we show
the results of such an experiment for a graphene-on-SiO2 device (to allow a comparison with the data in the main panel, the
pulse amplitude is converted into a corresponding electric field in
this figure). As the pulse duration is increased, the steady-state
current (measured at the end of the pulse) exhibits an apparent region
of negative differential conductance, which begins at progressively
lower fields as the pulse length is increased. This is not some intrinsic
feature of hot-carrier transport in graphene but, as noted previously
in ref (17), rather
results from the onset of charge trapping under high drain fields
(>10 kV/cm).

Figure 4 The main panel plots the results of pulsed current–voltage
measurements of the h-BN-encapsulated monolayer graphene FET. Results
are plotted for various pulse durations (indicated), and the solid
line is a guide to the eye. The top-gate voltage in these measurements
was −3 V, close to the Dirac point of the device. Inset: corresponding

In contrast to the behavior in the inset, in the main panel
of Figure 4, we show
corresponding
measurements of the pulsed current–voltage characteristics
of a h-BN-encapsulated (monolayer) graphene device. It is clear that
these data are independent of pulse duration, even when the pulse
length is increased to as much as a microsecond, in spite of the fact
that the corresponding field in the channel reaches values as large
as those shown in the inset.

For a more comprehensive analysis
of the influence of self-heating
and hot-carrier trapping in the encapsulated devices, it is helpful
to use the transient current to define a pulse-dependent resistance.
This is done by dividing the value of the applied voltage (Vp) by the peak value that the current reaches
during the on-stage of the pulse. In Figure 5, we plot the gate-voltage-dependent variation
of this resistance for a number of different pulse amplitudes. It
is apparent from this figure that the increase of the pulse amplitude
influences this resistance differently in the monolayer (Figure 5b) and bilayer (Figure 5a) devices; in the
former case, the increase of Vp causes
the transient resistance to increase, while in the latter it gives
rise to a decrease of resistance. These differences have actually
been noted previously in temperature-dependent studies of the linear
(dc) conductance of monolayer and bilayer graphene34−39 and have been explained in terms of the very different way in which
electron–phonon scattering is screened in these materials.38,39 Particularly beneficial here is the behavior observed in the bilayer
device (Figure 5a)
in which larger pulsed voltage (i.e., stronger heating) results in
a decrease of the overall resistance level. This should be in contrast
to the effects of charge trapping, which can be expected to result
in a decrease of current or an increase of resistance. In the discussion
that follows, we exploit these opposite characteristics to distinguish
the influence of heating and trapping on the transient behavior.

Figure 5 (a) Variation
of resistance as a function of gate voltage determined
for the h-BN-encapsulated bilayer graphene FET at the indicated pulsed-voltage
amplitudes. Pulse duration, T = 20 ns; repetition
frequency fr = 10 kHz. (b) Variation of
resistance as a function of gate voltage determined for the h-BN-encapsulated
monolayer graphene FET at the indicated pulsed-voltage amplitudes.
Pulse duration, T = 60 ns; repetition frequency fr = 10 kHz. Arrows indicate the tendency exhibited
by the resistance as the pulse amplitude (Vp) is increased.

Returning to the data
of Figure 4, the absence
of any dependence on pulse duration in
the main panel not only indicates an absence of trapping but also
demonstrates that self-heating is negligible in these measurements.
This can be attributed to the low repetition frequency (fr = 100 kHz) used in these measurements, the choice of
which ensures that successive pulses remain well isolated from one
another and that there is no “build up” of heat in the
dielectric layers.18 In order to study
self-heating effects, we therefore increase the repetition frequency
(to 1 MHz) and vary the pulse duration over a range of 40–750
ns, which allows us to study the evolution from isolated pulses to
near-dc biasing. The results of such an experiment are presented in Figure 6a,b, of which the
applied pulse amplitude (0.5 V) corresponds to an average channel
field of 10 kV/cm. Figure 6a represents the transient behavior observed near the charge-neutrality
point, while in Figure 6b the gate voltage implies a corresponding hole doping of 5.8 ×
1012 cm–2. Regardless of these differences,
the two figures reveal essentially the same behavior, namely, a systematic
increase in the overall current level as pulse duration is increased.
(Note that Vout is the voltage detected
at the 50 Ω input to the oscilloscope and thus is directly proportional
to the transient current). This increase is the effect of self-heating,
which leads to a decrease in the resistance of bilayer graphene with
increased temperature, as observed already in Figure 5a.

Figure 6 Pulsed measurements of the h-BN-encapsulated
bilayer device at
a repetition frequency of 1 MHz. Pulse duration is varied from 40–750
ns in each of the panels. To highlight the time-dependent variations
exhibited by these data, the various panels focus on the range of
data near the top of the voltage pulse. (a) Top-gate voltage = 0 V, Vp = 0.5 V. (b) Top-gate voltage = −40
V, Vp = 0.5 V. (c) Top-gate voltage =
0 V, Vp = 3.0 V. (d) Top-gate voltage
= −40 V, Vp = 3.0 V. The average
field in the channel is 10 kV/cm (60 kV/cm) in panels (a) and (b)
[panels (c) and (d)].

In Figure 6c,d,
the amplitude of the voltage pulses is increased to 3.0 V, corresponding
to an average electric field of 60 kV/cm. The resulting behavior differs
very strongly between the two panels, with Figure 6c exhibiting the self-heating behavior noted
already for Figure 6a,b. In Figure 6d,
however, the transient variations are more complicated. For given
pulse duration, the transient current grows over time, reminiscent
of the heating signatures present in Figure 6a–c. As the pulse duration is increased,
however, there is a systematic decrease in the overall current level,
behavior that is indicative of carrier trapping.

The interplay
of self-heating and trapping is further demonstrated
in Figure 7 in which
the repetition frequency has been reduced to 100 kHz, allowing us
to apply even longer pulses. In Figure 7a, the behavior is much like that in Figure 6c, with the data showing only
the signatures of heating (current increasing with pulse duration).
The data of Figure 7b, on the other hand, are clearly dominated by carrier trapping,
with the overall current level systematically decreasing as the pulse
length is increased.

Figure 7 Pulsed measurements of the h-BN-encapsulated bilayer device
at
a repetition frequency of 100 kHz. Pulse duration is varied from 40–8000
ns in the two panels. To highlight the time-dependent variations exhibited
by these data, each panel focuses on the range of data near the top
of the voltage pulse. (a) Top-gate voltage = 0 V, Vp = 3.0 V. (b) Top-gate voltage = −40 V, Vp = 3.0 V. The average field in the channel
is 60 kV/cm in panels (a) and (b).

The key conclusion of Figures 6 and 7 is that trapping effects
may dominate the transient response of the graphene/h-BN system but
only when the drain and gate fields are both large; for an applied
gate voltage of −40 V, the corresponding gate field is 26 MV/cm,
which can be expected to induce significant band bending in the upper
h-BN. It is this bending that presumably facilitates the injection
of hot carriers from the graphene layer, when the field in that layer
is also large.

Turning to the issue of self-heating, this should
be governed by
a characteristic time constant (τ), whose value is related to
the thermal resistances and capacitances in the problem (see Figure 1a). The value of
this parameter may be inferred experimentally by fitting the form
of the transient current variation, observed under conditions where
trapping is insignificant. Some examples of this are provided in Figure 8, the data of which
were obtained for the bilayer device with the top gate grounded (i.e., Vg = 0 V). The data of the main panel were obtained
for a pulse amplitude Vp of 3.0 V, while
for those in the inset Vp was 0.5 V. In
both of these figures, we fit the transient current variation observed
at the top of the pulse to the time-dependent form 1  where V0 is the voltage
initially attained at the end of the rising
edge of the pulse (defined here as t = 0) and ΔV and τ are treated as fit parameters. For the data
shown in the inset to Figure 8, we obtain a τ of 120 ns, while for that in the main
panel we find a τ of 150 ns; these two estimates are considered
to be consistent with one another.

Figure 8 Estimation of the thermal time constant
from the transient current.
Measurements of the h-BN-encapsulated bilayer device at a pulse repetition
frequency fr = 100 kHz. The top gate was
grounded in these measurements, and the pulse amplitudes were 3.0
and 0.5 V in the main panel and the inset, respectively. Solid lines
are fits through the data to the form of eq 1.

Finally, we compare the results of our pulsed measurements
of these
devices with those obtained under conditions of dc biasing. Representative
results are plotted in Figure 9, panels (a–c) of which were obtained for the monolayer
device and panels (d–f) were obtained for the bilayer one.
Results are shown for different gate voltages, with panels (b) and
(e) demonstrating the behavior obtained near the respective Dirac
points (compared with Figure 5). Panels (a) and (d), on the other hand, correspond to hole
doping of the FET channels, while panels (c) and (f) were obtained
for electron doping. Beginning with the monolayer device, we see that,
in all three panels, the data obtained by rapid pulsing attain higher
current levels than the corresponding dc data. The difference between
pulsed and dc measurements is smallest at the Dirac point (Figure 9b) and more pronounced
for strong hole doping (Figure 9a). For the bilayer device, however, we obtain the opposite
result, with the current being systematically smaller in the pulsed
experiments. These different observations can be explained in terms
of increased self-heating under dc biasing, if we recall that the
temperature coefficient of the resistance is of opposite sign for
monolayer and bilayer graphene.34−39 (Physically, the reason for this is the very different way in which
electron–phonon scattering is screened in these materials.38,39) In the monolayer FET, increased self-heating should lead to increased
resistance and thus to a decrease of the current. This is precisely
what is seen in the experiment (Figure 9a–c in which the current observed for dc conditions
is systematically lower than that obtained under transient pulsing.
Similarly, for bilayer graphene, self-heating should lower the channel
resistance, increasing the overall current level, precisely what is
seen in the results of Figure 9d–f. A comparison of the monolayer and bilayer data
reveals that the difference between dc and pulsed biasing is strongest
for the monolayer device. This is consistent with the behavior shown
in Figure 5 in which
the monolayer FET exhibits a larger relative resistance change as
gate voltage is varied than the bilayer one.

and dc current–voltage characteristics
for (a–c) h-BN-encapsulated monolayer device and (d–f)
h-BN-encapsulated bilayer device. The various panels correspond to
different values of the top-gate voltage (Vtg, indicated). Panels (b) and (e) are at the Dirac point of the devices,
while panels (a) and (d) [(c) and (f)] represent examples of heavy
hole (electron) doping. The pulse repetition frequency in these measurements fr was 100 kHz, while the pulse period T was 60 ns.

Discussion
The objective of this work was to evaluate the
influence of self-heating
and hot-carrier trapping on the operation of h-BN-encapsulated graphene
transistors and to compare these behaviors with those exhibited by
more common, graphene-on-SiO2, devices. With regard to
the role of carrier trapping, the improved immunity offered by h-BN
encapsulation was suggested by the results of measurements of the
small-signal transconductance of the different devices (Figure 3). These revealed a complete
suppression of the hysteresis that typically plagues graphene-on-SiO2 devices, behavior that has been attributed to charging of
interfacial and deep oxide traps.21,23,29−32 More importantly, however, through our transient
studies of nonequilibrium operation, we were able to confirm that
the immunity offered by h-BN encapsulation persists even in the hot-carrier
limit, pertinent to the operation of practical devices. This was demonstrated
most clearly in Figure 4, where the maximum current measured during transient pulsing was
shown to be independent of the pulse duration. Through further studies,
we were able to establish that signatures of trapping can be observed
in the encapsulated system but that this requires the simultaneous
presence of large gate and drain fields (see Figures 6d and 7b). From studies
in which it is incorporated as the tunnel barrier in vertical-transport
devices, h-BN has been shown to possess various native defects that
can mediate current under the application of large electric fields.40−43 While these defects are not expected to be present at the concentrations
found in SiO2, one possibility is that they may mediate
the trapping of hot carriers in h-BN via the Poole–Frenkel
mechanism.44 This phenomenon is well-known
from the study of conduction mechanisms in dielectrics and refers
to the ability of a strong electric field to lower the potential barrier
associated with impurity sites, thereby allowing them to mediate the
capture and/or emission of energetic carriers. To definitively assert
the role of the Poole–Frenkel mechanism in our experiments,
it would be necessary to demonstrate that the leakage current exhibited
by the gate follows the characteristic dependence on the electric
field associated with this effect.44 Since
the gate leakage remained at subnanoampere levels in our experiments,
however, it was not possible to make this identification. Nonetheless,
in our experiments, we note that the signatures of trapping are observed
once the gate and (average) drain fields reach values of orders 107 and 105 V/cm, respectively. We suggest that this
very large gate field lowers the energy barrier associated with the
h-BN trapping sites, allowing the high drain field to inject hot carriers
into these sites from the graphene. Nonetheless, in spite of this
behavior, the essential message that should be taken away from this
study is that h-BN encapsulation offers an effective means to significantly
suppress (if not completely eliminate) the influence of hot-carrier
trapping in graphene devices.

Turning next to the issue of self-heating,
our study provides valuable
insight into how this influences device operation. This is essentially
achieved by using the transient conductance of the graphene to “detect”
phonon excitation in the surrounding dielectric layers of the device.
The sequence of events that is initiated when the pulsed voltage is
first applied to the device begins with the thermalization of graphene’s
carriers at an effective hot temperature, following which these nonequilibrium
carriers lose energy to the external reservoirs and to the phonon
modes of the graphene itself. Essentially, these processes may be
viewed as instantaneous, at least on the timescale of our measurements.17 Ultimately, however, phonon conduction will
transfer heat from the graphene to the surrounding dielectrics, generating
nonequilibrium phonon populations in these layers. This results in
a “feedback” process in which carriers in the graphene
layer can now be additionally scattered through their interaction
with nonequilibrium phonons in the h-BN layers, generating an associated
change in the transistor current. It is this time-dependent growth
of phonon-induced scattering that we are essentially watching when
(in the absence of charging) we observe time-dependent variations
of the transient current in our experiments (see Figures 6a–c and 8). To support this argument, it is helpful to estimate the
various thermal time constants associated with the different layers
indicated in Figure 1a. While we refer the reader to the Methods for the details of this analysis, by accounting for heat conduction
through the constituent dielectric layers, we estimate a total time
constant of ∼130 ns. This value is in excellent agreement with
that determined experimentally (100–150 ns, see Figure 8) for the self-heating, confirming
our understanding of this behavior.

In conclusion, in this research
article, we have used transient
measurements to investigate the details of self-heating and charge
trapping in h-BN-encapsulated graphene transistors operated under
strongly nonequilibrium conditions. Relative to more standard devices
fabricated on SiO2 substrates, encapsulation has been shown
to lead to an enhanced immunity to charge trapping, the influence
of which is only apparent under the combined influence of strong gate
and drain electric fields. The strong gate field can be expected to
lower the barriers associated with native defects in the h-BN, allowing
energetic carriers to then be captured from the channel in a Poole–Frenkel
type process. Self-heating in these devices was identified through
the observation of time-dependent variations of the current in graphene
and was found to be described by a time constant consistent with expectations
for nonequilibrium phonon conduction into the dielectric layers of
the device. The importance of proper substrate selection for the performance
of graphene FETs has long been appreciated theoretically.45−48 Our results here confirm that h-BN-encapsulated graphene devices
provide an excellent system for implementations in which operation
under strongly nonequilibrium conditions is desired. It will be interesting
to extend these measurements in the future to graphene encapsulated
in other 2D materials,1 including various
transition-metal dichalcogenides (MoS2, WS2,
WSe2, etc.).

Methods
Device
Fabrication
Two types of graphene transistors were fabricated
for this study, those encapsulated in h-BN and more standard graphene-on-SiO2 devices. While the fabrication of the latter devices has
been described in detail previously,19,20 the encapsulated
devices were realized through a modified dry-transfer process. In
this approach, Ti/Au source and drain electrodes were first fabricated
on a flake of h-BN, exfoliated onto a (300 nm thick) SiO2 layer. (The SiO2 was formed on top of a resistive Si
substrate, whose metallized bottom surface was used to define a ground
plane for the pulsed measurements.19) Next,
small graphene flakes, exfoliated onto another SiO2/Si
substrate, were picked up using a h-BN flake that had previously been
attached to a polypropylene carbonate (PPC) film. Using a transfer
stage, the graphene/h-BN heterostructure was then pressed against
the aforementioned electrodes, following which the PPC film was removed
by application of mild heat (90 °C) and subsequent solubilization
in chloroform. Following this, the device was annealed in a reducing
atmosphere for 1 h at 523 K to improve the quality of the electrical
contacts. This completed the encapsulation process, following which
electron beam lithography and metal lift-off were used to realize
50 Ω matched on-chip coplanar waveguides for the pulsed measurements.19 Two different encapsulated devices were studied
here, one consisting of monolayer graphene and the other being a bilayer
device. The source–drain separations in these devices were
1 and 0.5 μm, respectively. In the monolayer system, the thicknesses
of the upper and lower layers (as determined by atomic force microscopy)
were 152 ± 4 and 161 ± 5 μm, respectively. Corresponding
figures for the bilayer device were 152 ± 4 and 152 ± 3
μm.

Transient
Measurements
Pulsed current–voltage characteristics
of the devices were measured at room temperature in a repetitive-pulsing
scheme that has been described in detail in refs (17) and (18). The measurements were
made in a custom-designed setup with full (50 Ω) impedance matching.
The device chip was mounted on an FR-4 laminate board, allowing the
signal lines of its coplanar waveguide to be connected to semirigid
coaxial cables (see Figure 2). Repetitive pulses were applied with an AVTECH generator,
providing a maximum pulse amplitude of 10 V and a repetition frequency
that could be varied from 10 kHz–1 MHz. Resulting output pulses
were then captured by a fast oscilloscope (either a Tektronix CSA8000B
digital-sampling oscilloscope with 50 GHz bandwidth or a Keysight
MSOX6004A mixed-signal oscilloscope with 6 GHz bandwidth).

Estimation
of Thermal Time Constants
Thermal time constants () were estimated for the different layers of the
device using their
known thermal properties and their physical dimensions. The latter
was determined from inspection using a combination of atomic force
and optical microscopy. Assumed thermal conductivities were 25, 1.3,
and 80 W/(m·K) for h-BN, SiO2, and Si, respectively,
while corresponding specific heats were taken to be 700, 680, and
750 J/(kg·K). Using these values, we arrived at estimates for
the corresponding thermal time constants τh-BN, τSiO2, and τSi of ∼1.5, ∼118, and ∼6 ns, from which
the total time constant τ was estimated as ∼130 ns.
