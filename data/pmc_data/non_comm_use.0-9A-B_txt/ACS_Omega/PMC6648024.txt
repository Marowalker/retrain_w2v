Most of the existing robots would
find it difficult to stretch
and transform all parts of their body together due to rigid components
and complex actuation mechanisms inside. Here, we presented a highly
transformable liquid-metal composite (LMC) that is easy to change
shape in large magnitude and resume its original state again according
to need. When subject to heating, part of the ethanol droplets embedded
in the composite would change phase and then actuate. We demonstrate
the flexible transformation of LMC-made octopus from a two-dimensional
shape into several predictable three-dimensional shapes freely on
a large scale (even up to 11 times its initial height) through remote
wireless heating, which needs no sophisticated operating system at
all. Further, several designed behaviors, such as movement of octopus
and entangling objects of soft robots, are also realized. Theoretical
analysis of the heating-induced liquid–vapor transition of
the embedded ethanol droplet interprets the mechanisms involved. The
present findings open a new way to fabricate functional transformable
composites that would find significant applications in developing
future generation soft robots.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Robots
are usually designed to be stiff, composed of intrinsically
rigid materials, hard links, and joints, which limit their flexibility
and deformability.1 However, living beings,
from fully soft-bodied octopus to mammals with stiff endo-exoskeleton
or exoskeletons, all own soft bodies. In recent years, soft robots
are emerging as a quickly growing field that focuses on mimicking
elastic skin, muscle, and mollusk.2−4 Different from hard-bodied
robots, soft robots with deformable structure are capable of bending,
twisting, and shape-changing so as to adapt to various unstructured
environments.5−7 Earlier, a series of untethered soft robots and mollusk
robots have been developed,4,8 including wormlike robot,9 caterpillar-like robots,10,11 octopus-like robots,12−16 etc. As is well known, actuation is one of the main challenges in
developing untethered soft robots. Especially, to achieve soft robots
like octopus and jellyfish that can freely transform their morphologies
and locomotion without relying on a rigid skeleton, soft actuation
components deserve careful consideration and implementation. So far,
there has already been a variety of ingenious methods to actuate the
soft robots, including pneumatic actuators,17,18 shape memory polymers,19,20 liquid crystal elastomers,21,22 fluidic elastomer actuators,23 and pressurized
fluids actuators.10,24 Among the many different soft
actuation methods, liquid–vapor phase change materials especially
present an attractive performance, such as high expansion strain and
simple controls.24−26 Phase change of low-boiling point materials such
as ethanol has been proven to be a better actuation method for making
soft robots.27,28 However, it seems to be difficult
to transform freely into more sophisticated shapes as desirable than
inflating on the basis of only the joule heating. Besides, the flexibility,
stretchability, and thermal conductivity of phase change material
composites should improve significantly to fulfill the need.

The room-temperature liquid metals refer to those materials with
high conductivity of metals and good mobility of fluids that might
be a building block for fabricating soft robots.29 In addition, liquid-metal silica rubber composites30−32 have attracted increasing attention because of their various potential
applications and promising properties, including outstanding softness
and super elasticity,33−35 enhancing fracture energy,36 high thermal conductivity,30 capability
of wireless heating, and three-dimensional (3D) printing feature in
multiple styles.37 With outstanding versatile
capabilities, liquid-metal composites (LMC) might be well suitable
for fabricating soft robots. However, one of the toughest bottlenecks
for fabricating soft robots with these is the lack of inherent actuation
components. Up to now, there have been no reports about introducing
the phase changing materials in the liquid-metal composites.

Here, we developed liquid-metal composites that are capable of
freely transforming and stretching any parts for performing complex
and desirable deformation in response to wireless heating. Such stretchable
liquid-metal composites (LMC) are composed of liquid metal (gallium–indium,
eutectic; EGaIn) mixed with silicone elastomer and then blend with
liquid ethanol to produce extremely large volume changes in response
to thermal stimuli. The role of the liquid metal as introduced here
remarkably improves the thermal conductivity up to 4 times higher
and reduces the elastic modulus of LMC dramatically (43.1%) of the
primary elastomer–ethanol composites, both of which contribute
most to the free transformation capability. Combining the desired
merits of all above materials together, we made a conceptual soft
robot that demonstrates significant flexibility, quick response capability,
and electromagnetic induction actuation and is freely transformable.
We present transformation of LMC-made octopus from a two-dimensional
(2D) shape into several predictable 3D shapes (even up to 11 times
its original height) freely only with wireless heating and without
any sophisticated operating system. We show the characteristics of
the composites and present theoretical interpretation on the transformation
mechanism. With this material, we designed and evaluated a group of
entangling behaviors and temperature-controlled movements of wormlike
robots.

2 Results
2.1 Fabrication of Liquid-Metal
Composites
The liquid metal is mainly composed of 75.5% gallium
and 24.5% indium
by weight, which is dispersed in an uncured silicone elastomer. To
achieve the soft actuation, the key component for soft robots, phase
change agent ethanol, is chosen to realize large volume change via
liquid–vapor conversion mechanism. Liquid ethanol has a low
boiling point (78.4 °C) and is nontoxic, making it an excellent
candidate for actuation. Liquid-metal composites (LMC) are fabricated
through shear-mixing the uncured liquid-metal elastomer with liquid
ethanol (weight ratio 9:1), which is ready to cast and print into
different shapes before solidifying. The LMC can be easily fabricated
(within 2 min), which is shown in Figure 1a (more details are available in Section 5). The liquid-metal
composites thus made display high stretchability (700%, Figure 1b). The microstructure when
stretching is shown in Figure S1. Under
heating condition, LMC swells and changes shape freely in response
to the increasing pressure due to ethanol liquid evaporation. The
liquid-metal loading plays an important role in the free transformation
of composites. Ultrahigh deformability of LMC is depicted in Figure 1c and Movie S1, where LMC is more inclined to deform
its body to a 3D shape compared with the control group.

significant shape change; the scale bar is 2 cm. (d) Elasticity modulus
of LMC with different LM weight ratios. (e) Local deformation of LMC
in response to the change of heat source location. (f) Through selective
heating, the local area of LMC swells sequentially and forms the 3D
shape.

As can be seen in the metalloscope
micrography image (Figure S2a), liquid-metal
droplets are encapsulated
in the composites of silicone elastomer. Applying micro CT (computed
tomographic, Carl Zeiss Xradia 410 versa), 3D structure of LMC can
be scanned, as shown in Figure S2b. White
points refer to LM droplets, which are distributed throughout the
silicone polymer, along with the ethanol bubbles. The deformation
mechanism of this composite can be attributed to the strong extrusion
of ethanol evaporation, compelling the sealed elastomer to expand
and transform (Figure S2c). Therefore,
the high thermal conductivity and flexibility are both critical to
maximizing the effectiveness of evaporation and deformation. At the
same pressure from the phase transition, materials with a lower elastic
modulus are able to generate the larger deformation.

Elastic
modulus within the limit of proportionality can be described
as follows 1  where, , F is the force, S is the force
acting area, L is the length,
σ is the stress, and ε is the strain

Therefore,
under the same evaporation force, materials with a lower
elastic modulus can produce larger strain and deformation. To develop
robots with excellent deformation ability, materials with lower elastic
modulus should be selected. Liquid-metal inclusions in LMC can decrease
the elastic modulus significantly (Figure 1d), making it a better candidate for fabricating
soft robots. LMC with 60% LM exhibited the best performance, which
reduced the elastic modulus by 43.1%. Besides, high fracture energies
of liquid-metal elastomer35 present good
tear resistance in the expansion process. Even with extremely large
swelling, LMCs are difficult to fracture, which can enhance the performance
of soft actuators. In a word, liquid-metal inclusions are able to
soften the material and open promising opportunities for the development
of soft components.

Programmable and desirable swellings are
challenging capabilities
to realize in soft actuation. Herein, controlled swelling of LMC can
also be conveniently achieved through selective heating, which broadens
the range of its application. Figure 1e demonstrates the local deformation of LMC in response
to the change of heat source location. Therefore, it is possible to
expand any parts of the composites and achieve programmable 3D structures
as desired. Figure 1f shows that the planar LMC swells and uplifts sequentially in a
specific area when subject to selective heating (Movies S2 and S3), and finally
forms a 3D structure, which can be recovered to its original planar
shape when cooled.

2.2 Demonstration of Thermally
Responsive Capability
As mentioned above, LMC are able to
deform reversibly in response
to the heat stimulation. Various heating methods can be applied to
actuate the reversible deformation of LMC. In this section, we applied
four methods to heat the LMC, including a microwave oven, hot plate,
heat gun, and a magnetic coil, all of which can lead to swelling and
deformation. First, we come up with the experiments to utilize a microwave
oven (Midea L1) to heat up LMC. It is well known that the bulk metal
is hard to heat by electromagnetic radiation at microwave frequencies
due to the fact that the electromagnetic penetration depth is on the
order of microns and most of the electromagnetic energy is reflected.
However, our experimental results indicate that the liquid-metal droplets
effectively interact with microwaves for heat generation, which is
similar to the observation in sintering of metal powders in a microwave
field.38 For the microwave frequency f = 2.45 GHz, liquid-metal conductivity σ = 3 ×
106 S/m and the permeability of free space μ0 = 4π × 10–7 H/m. The released
power of the interaction between liquid-metal droplets with microwave
is strongly dependent on its radius. The maximum of the volume heat
generation is obtained through optimizing the liquid-metal droplet
radius39 with Rm = 2.4δ = 14 μm. The stirring time plays an important
role in regulating the droplet size. In comparison with Figure S3a (stirring for 50 s), Figure S3b shows the LMCs that have been stirred for a longer
time (500 s), whose droplet sizes are smaller. Due to the irregular
shape of droplets, the areas rather than radius are calculated. The
longer stirring time can reduce the liquid-metal droplets areas efficiently.
Therefore, to achieve the best absorption efficiency of microwave
energy, we can regulate the stirring time to acquire the appropriate
droplet size. Compared with the silicone mixed only with liquid ethanol,
the released power of microwave to the liquid-metal inclusion is much
higher and significantly improves the absorption efficiency, which
leads to the temperature increasing much faster, facilitating the
deformation of the elastomer matrix.

To visually demonstrate
the expansion effect of soft liquid-metal materials with different
LM contents, a middle-level microwave power (600 W) is applied to
heat six cubic LMC, of which the liquid-metal proportion ranges from
0 to 81%, as shown in Figure 2a. After heating for 90 s, the thermal images and temperature
variations are recorded by an infrared camera, from which one can
notice that, with a higher liquid-metal proportion, the ultimate temperature
would be higher too. During the microwave heating process, if the
temperature of the soft material exceeds 78.4 °C (boiling temperature
of ethanol), the ethanol liquid would evaporate and inflate the LMC
(Figure S4a,b).

Figure 2 Expansion of LMC in response
to different heating methods. (a)
When heated by microwave, the temperature of LMC with larger LM loading
rises more quickly, as shown in the infrared image. The scale bar
is 2 cm. (b) When heated on a hot plate, LMC presents an obvious hunching
behavior, whereas the control group (without LM) shows no significant
shape change. The scale bar is 2 cm. (c) The temperature of LMC with
a 60% LM weight ratio rises much faster, compared to 30 and 0% LM
weight ratios. (d) Thermal conductivity and heating rates of LMC with
different LM ratios. (e) LMC swells in response to wireless heating
with a magnetic coil.

We also used a hot plate (150 °C) to heat LMC directly.
From Figure 2b, the
LMC expands
and transforms, whereas materials without liquid metal do not although
subject to the same heating time (180 s). The basic reason lies in
that LMC with liquid metal warms faster compared to that lacking liquid
metal when heated upon a hot plate, as indicated by infrared thermometry
images (Figure 2b).
Complex deformation behaviors of LMC are achieved by coupling the
heterogeneous structure design with targeted heating. As shown in Figure S4c,d, when heated on a hot plate, the
LMC sheet curves into a wave shape due to the designed uneven heat
distribution.

To further validate the assumption that liquid
metal accelerates
the warming effect, surface temperature variations of LMC with different
weight ratios (0, 30, and 60%) are recorded with three thermocouples.
We heated LMC for 180 s on a hot plate; the heating curves of three
LMCs are shown in Figure 2c. Obviously, the surface temperature of LMC with 60% liquid
metal rises most quickly and reaches the highest value (84 °C)
compared with the other two. As expected, the temperature of LMC for
lack of liquid metal rises slowly. Therefore, experimental results
are consistent with the hypothesis that liquid metal enhances heating
efficiency. With higher temperature, ethanol evaporates more easily,
leading to quicker deformation. Figure 2d (right) shows the temperature rising rate of three
materials containing different LM ratios in 90 s. The temperature
rising speed of LMC with 60% LM (0.64 °C/s) is almost 4.5 times
quicker than that of the materials without liquid metal (0.14 °C/s).
Thermal conductivity of the three materials (0% LM, 30% LM, and 60%
LM) is 0.2, 0.44, and 0.87 W/(m °C), respectively (tested by
a hot disk), which is approximately in agreement with experimental
results. Hence, heat-responsive robots made from LMC with more liquid
metal will be more responsive and expand faster (at least 4.5 times),
which is an important characteristic of soft actuators.

In consideration
of the good electrical conductivity of liquid
metal, an electromagnetic induction heater can also be utilized to
heat and deform the liquid-metal soft robots. To achieve a directed
deformation pattern, a three-layer configuration is designed to realize
electromagnetic induction heating, which contains a noninflatable
transparent poly(dimethylsiloxane) layer, a liquid-metal layer with
a rectangular net pattern, and an LMC layer. The fabrication process
is shown in Figure S4e. Due to the theory
of electromagnetic induction heating, the sizes of heating conductors
are required to be macrocomparable with the heating copper coil; thus,
the eddy current could be generated and transformed into thermal energy.
When the three-layer liquid metal is placed upon the coil and the
power source is switched on, the heater would induce an eddy current
in the liquid-metal layer with a grid shape. Further, the current
would be transformed into thermal energy and increase the temperature
of LMC. As the temperature exceeds the boiling point of ethanol, the
polymer layer would be inflated and swell into a curved shape due
to the nonequilibrium of stretchability (Figure 2e).

2.3 Demonstration of Thermally
Responsive Soft
Robots
LMCs are capable of reversible deformation between
planar shape and designed 3D structure. As shown in Figure 3a, a cylindrical material hunches
in the target regions when heated selectively. While cooling, the
hunching area shrinks to its original shape immediately. As expected,
heating causes the specific region to expand and hunch again, which
can be repeated many times if needed (Movie S4). Further, the LMC ball deforms reversibly after repeated heating
and cooling via a heat gun. More interestingly, this soft ball is
capable of changing the skin colors of their skin through the temperature
modulation. Once temperature increases, the soft robots expand as
ethanol evaporates and exposes the liquid-metal droplets inside, changing
their color of appearance from gray to silver (Figure S5). When the temperature decreases, the robots contract
along with color recovery. Therefore, the soft robot can control its
color with temperature like the chameleon in nature. As we know, repeatability
and the degree of extreme deformation are critical indicators of soft
transformable robots. We record the repeatability of expansion and
shrinking (Figure S6). In Figure S6, the blue points represent the initial height (1.4
mm) whereas the red points are the final height of uplifting after
heating. The peak value of the uplifting height is 16 mm (more than
11 times the original height). The experiments demonstrate that the
cycle of a higher expansion ratio (about 6 times of the original height)
can repeat more than 24 times. The ethanol gas releasing from LMC
limits the repeatability of expansion, which might be solved by sealing
the LMC with airtight materials. These basic actions can be applied
to realize controlled actuation as desired.

Figure 3 Demonstration of different
kinds of soft robots: (a) a cylindrical
shaped LMC is selectively heated and cooled along with swelling and
contraction reversibly. (b) LMC-made octopus transforms from a 2D
shape to 3D shape; the scale bar is 2 cm. (c) Temperature change-induced
locomotion of the soft robot. When heated, the robot expands and elongates
its body and the front leg moves to the right in response to the elongation.
When cooled, the robot shortens its body and the posterior leg moves
to the right as well as the whole body motion. The scale bar is 2
cm. (d) The process of the LMC robot grabbing objects with contactless
heating.

A 2D LMC-made octopus inflates
itself in response to the selective
heating, and deformation between 2D and 3D structures can be repeated
many times only through the temperature regulation (Figure 3b and Movie S5). In addition, we designed a soft robot consisting of LMC,
which can move toward a certain direction driven by heating and cooling
(Figure 3c and Movie S6). A schematic diagram of how this soft
robot proceeds with locomotion is shown in Figure 3b. Both ends of a bar of LMC are inserted
in a special socket, whose surface is carved with gear rack pattern.
Specifically, the gear rack pattern slants to one side, causing smaller
friction when the direction of relative motion is the same as that
in which the gear rack pattern slants. The surface of the rail is
carved with a similar pattern but in a complementary way. As a result,
the friction force of moving toward the left is significantly smaller
than moving toward the right. When the robot is placed on the rail
and heated with a heat gun, its length would increase. Since moving
toward the left is easier than moving toward the right, the force
of expansion pushes the left end of the robot to the left, whereas
the right parts just remain fixed due to the large friction of moving
toward right. Therefore, the centroid of the robot moves toward the
left. When the robot is cooled by spraying water, the force of shrinking
would pull the right end toward the left rather than the left end
to the right due to a friction force difference. The centroid of the
robot still moves toward the left. With each circle of heating and
cooling, the robot would gradually move toward the left, creating
continuous locomotion. From the Movie S6, the robot moves via heating and cooling at a speed of 6 mm/min.
The speed should be increased by improving the speed of operation
(heating and cooling). This method offers a new way to actuate the
movement of soft robots.

The soft gripper is one of the important
applications in soft robotics.40,41 On heating the target
region with a heat gun, the local area would
swell and deform controllably to manage different tasks. Figure 3d shows the process
of the robot grabbing objects. This flexible disk can gradually fold
and grab the object when heated because the two layers of the robots
expand at different speeds due to the uneven heating (heat on the
top layer side). As the top layer contains ethanol that creates bubbles
when heated, it expands much faster and pushes the lower layer to
fold and grab the object (Movie S7). This
flexible hand is pretty much like tentacles of an octopus. Once cooled,
the soft hand loosens and releases the object and recovers to the
plane due to the liquidation of ethanol. Better yet, this gripper
can be constructed entirely with soft material and controlled with
wireless heating.

Many other behaviors are also demonstrated
in Figure S7; a three-legged robot starts
warping when heated
unevenly and begins rolling on the hot plate without any other external
manipulation (Figure S7a and Movie S8). The part near the heat source expands
faster, causing the material to bend toward the other part. With a
simple design, LMC can form different shaped structures with selective
heating. After continuous heating, LMC inflates its tummy like a puffer
(Figure S7b). With elaborate design, LMCs
are capable of achieving more complicated and desirable deformation
and locomotion.

3 Discussion
To quantitatively
predict the expansion and deformations of LMC
induced by heating, we derived the analytical relation of the expansion
induced by the heating temperature (the detailed discussion is given
in the Supporting Information). The main
results are presented here. We assume that the ethanol droplet uniformly
embedded in the LMC matrix with the total volume fraction η.
The average radius is R0 in the undeformed
LMC, and R in the deformed elastomer due to the transition
from liquid ethanol to vapor state. Then, the volumetric expansion
is estimated by 2  For a small value of volume fraction η
(lesser than 20%), we suppose that the interaction of droplets is
negligible. Thus, considering a single ethanol droplet with radius R0 embedded in the infinite LMC matrix illustrated
in Figure 4a, it would
boil and become vapor upon reaching the liquid–vapor transition
temperature. This leads to a significant expansion of the whole LMC
matrix. The thermal properties of ethanol saturation vapor pressure
and its saturation liquid and vapor densities are given in Figure 4b,c. Figure 4d,e shows that the volume expansion
ratio and the boiling ethanol vapor mass ratio are affected by the
shear modulus of the LMC elastomer and the limiting stretch for the
volume fraction η = 20%. The results indicate that the shear
modulus of the LMC elastomer has a significant impact on the volume
expansion ratio, which could be modulated by changing the liquid-metal
inclusion volume. In addition, increasing the limiting stretch through
adding liquid metal can also improve the capability of volume expansion.

(c) Its saturation liquid and vapor density. (d) The volume expansion
ratio and the boiling ethanol vapor mass ratio for the fixed shear

the fixed limiting stretch λlim = 3.

We choose the liquid metal as a filler mainly due
to increase of
thermal conductivity and decrease of the elastic modulus as well as
wireless heating. Besides, former research found that the liquid metal
can increase fracture energy significantly36 and alleviate the damage due to the stretching in the expansion
process. The experiment found that it is difficult to achieve free
transformation into different shapes without the addition of liquid
metal. The crucial limit of this material needs to be improved. The
release of ethanol vapor leads to a low repeatability, which might
be solved by sealing the LMC with airtight materials. The experiments
demonstrate that the cycle of a higher expansion ratio (about 6 times
of the original height) can repeat for more than 24 times. Indeed,
vapor pressure increases continuously in the high temperature, leading
to the pockets’ rupture eventually. To improve repeatability
of LMCs, the heating time should be well controlled. Because there
are many pockets inside (from the microstructure image), they can
expand many times at a high ratio. From the Movie S2, the LMC can swell many times in the same place. If most
of the pockets rupture in the first heating, it is hard to swell again
and form a similar shape. Under the same evaporation force, materials
with a lower elastic modulus can produce larger strain and deformation.
In fact, the heating process of ethanol–polymer composites
are always accompanied by the voice of cracking due to the rupture
of small pockets. Therefore, ethanol–polymer composites are
more inclined to rupture in comparison with LMC. The liquid metal
in the LMC might increase the repeatability of actuation compared
with the ethanol and polymer composites.

As we know, there are
many other thermally responsive materials
that have better repeatability than LMC, including shape memory alloys
and thermally responsive polymers. However, it is difficult for them
to achieve very large volume change when compared with liquid–vapor
transition actuation. Besides, compared with other solid fillers,
liquids are easy to comply with the soft components.

On the
basis of the properties of deforming in response to the
thermal stimulus, LMC implementation would be further improved via
programmable control, thus achieving a more precise, quick response
and adaptable bulging deformation. To achieve accurate and controllable
bending, twisting, or swelling of the composite, we can adhere array
soft heating film units on the surface of the composites and control
the on/off state of every single unit independently. Thus, the desired
heating fields could be realized and further control the deformation
of LMC. Besides, the composite can also be threaded by resistance
heating wire as the composite itself is insulative. Heating wires
can be regularly aligned before the molding of LMC. Both the heating
film and heating wire can be adjusted by a programmed circuit board;
hence, the deformation of LMC is controllable through this integration.
Applying the embedded control system and sensors, as well as localized
heating units, different robots with multiple locomotion configurations
could be further developed, such as rolling robots or wriggling worm
robots. In addition, various energy forms like solar energy or electric
energy can be converted to heat to actuate more completed LMC robots.
Besides, LMC has potential for being applied in other areas, such
as a temperature sensor, pressure sensor, or ultrastretchable soft
screen on account of its color changing capability after stretching.
As known to us all, the liquid metal integrates properties of both
liquids and metals, thus being a good candidate for soft electronics
in soft robots. Unique properties of liquid metal endow LMCs with
a huge application value. For instance, the LM can be designed as
functional circuits on LMC for actuating, lighting, and displaying.
In addition, the liquid-metal layer on the LMC has an anti-interference
function of electromagnetic radiation. Liquid-metal antenna can also
be applied in the LMC-made soft robotics, such as transmitting information
when performing tasks. It is expected that this shape transformable
in a large-scale composite material could also help researchers in
other areas to find novel implementations in biomedical engineering,
aerospace engineering, etc.

4 Conclusions
To summarize,
we proposed large-magnitude transformable liquid-metal
composites via combining liquid metal, elastomer, as well as liquid
ethanol together, which can reversibly transform their shape at will
on a pretty wide scale (even up to 11 times their original height)
in response to wireless heating. We demonstrated the transformation
of LMC-made octopus from a 2D shape into several predictable 3D shapes
only by wireless heating without requiring any sophisticated operating
system. A particular finding lies in that in such a composite, it
is hard to achieve a freely transformable behavior without the addition
of liquid metal. Here, liquid-metal inclusions do work in reducing
the elastic modulus by 43.1%, increase the thermal conductivity (up
to 450%), and play an indispensable role during wireless heating.
Theoretical analysis about heating-induced liquid–vapor transition
of the embedded ethanol droplet indicates that the shear modulus and
limiting stretch (700% strain) as well as the thermal conductivity
of LMC contribute most to the volume expansion ratio, all of which
can be improved by the loading of liquid-metal inclusions. Designed
behaviors of entangling objects like jellyfish and inching like worm
only via heating and cooling are also achieved. The present composite
opens doors to realize freely transformable robots, which are completely
constructed with fully soft materials and could be entirely controlled
by wireless heating.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Preparation Methods of LMC
The raw
materials for LMC are composed of 75.5% gallium (Nanjing Jinmei Gallium
LTD., 99.999%) and 24.5% indium (Shaoguan Jinyuan Industrial Co.,
Ltd., 99.999%) by weight and silicone rubber (methyl vinyl polysiloxane
and Pt-catalyzed polymethylhydrosiloxane). They are fully mixed to
reduce the formation of liquid-metal droplets and suspend in uncured
silicone rubber adequately. Thereafter, ethanol is vigorously mixed
in the above compound, resulting in a notable expansion capability
of the material under heating condition. The proportions of the three
elements in LMC can be varied according to the experimental requirement,
which are noted in the relative text. Over these steps, different
stirring times were chosen to achieve different droplet sizes. LMC
10% wt ethanol and 60% weight ratio liquid metal was chosen when considering
the high thermal conductivity and lower elastic modulus (Figures 1d and 2d).

5.2 Electromagnetic Induction
Heater
Although the liquid-metal polymer consists of EGaIn
metal droplets,
the metal could not form strong electrical current due to the distributed
and microscale characteristics. The electromagnetic induction heater
is a self-designed alternating current generator connected to a copper
plate coil, which is 6 mm in thickness and 8 cm in diameter and connected
to a water-cooling system. The heater is powered by a 50 V, 50 A constant
voltage source (Huawei R4850N6).

5.3 Temperature
Recording
Temperature
variations of LMC are recorded by an infrared camera (Figure 2a,b). When applying the microwave
heating methods, it is hard to test the LMC temperature in real time.
Therefore, we took them out from the microwave oven immediately and
then measured the temperature by an infrared camera. In Figure 2c,d, T-type thermocouples placed
on the upper surface of the LMC were used to measure the temperatures
of the LMC, which was placed on a hot plate (150 °C). For the
purpose of collecting the real-time temperature data of the LMC, a
