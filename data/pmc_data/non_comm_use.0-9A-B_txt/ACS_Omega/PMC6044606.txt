G-Quadruplex
DNA structure has been proven to be a binding target
for small molecular organic compounds and hence regarded as a promising
pharmacological target. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapy drug
that targets duplex DNA and was recently shown to react also with
G-quadruplex, implying that cisplatin actually may also target G-quadruplex.
In this work, we employed magnetic tweezers to investigate the influence
of cisplatin on the folding kinetics of single human telomeric G-quadruplex.
It was revealed that cisplatin and G-quadruplex interact in two different
and competitive ways that depend on cisplatin concentration.

Introduction
G-Quadruplex, an important
DNA secondary structure, is stacked
by two or more planar guanine tetrads formed by four guanine bases
through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds.1−4 In human telomere sequences, numerous tandem
d(TTAGGG) repeats form G-quadruplexes in vivo to protect chromosome
ends.5 In gene replication, G-quadruplex
plays a vital role in the activity of the telomerases, which maintain
the telomere length and are commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.
Various small molecules have been reported to be capable of binding
to telomere G-quadruplexes through a π–π stacking
interaction.6−10 Thus, human telomeric G-quadruplex may be a potential therapeutic
target for cancer treatments.7,11,12

Cisplatin has been used as a classical chemotherapy drug for
more
than 4 decades.13 Its major pharmacological
targets have been revealed to be double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).14 Under physiological conditions, cisplatin molecules
form positively charged active diaquated intermediates that attack
the N7 atoms of guanines or adenines to form monoadducts or diadducts.15,16 DNA damages caused by the adducts give rise to the cell apoptosis
process.17,18 The G-quadruplex sequences are guanine-rich,
which suggests that G-quadruplex may be a new promising target for
cisplatin. Bulk experiments (circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy,
UV-spectroscopically monitored thermal denaturation, and gel electrophoresis)
have been used to study the interaction between cisplatin and G-quadruplex.
Bombard and Ourliac Garnier19 and Brabec
et al.20 observed that cisplatin and transplatin
destabilize human telomeric G-quadruplex and H-telo quadruplexes.
Viglasky21 showed that cisplatin and transplatin
unfold telomeric G-quadruplexes Tel-1 and Tel-2 but do not affect
c-myc and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A DNA quadruplexes.
However, details of the interaction between G-quadruplexes and cisplatin
remain to be clarified.

Recently single-molecule techniques,
such as optical tweezers,
magnetic tweezers, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET), have proven to be powerful methods to study G-quadruplex
and its interaction with various ligands,22−27 which shed light on the folding kinetics of G-quadruplex. Our previous
studies revealed the condensation of dsDNA caused by cisplatin.28,29 In the present research, we used magnetic tweezers to investigate
the interaction between G-quadruplex and cisplatin at the single-molecule
level and aimed to find out how cisplatin binds to G-quadruplex and
affects the folding kinetics of G-quadruplex.

Methods
In our
experiments, one human telomeric G-quadruplex sequence 5′-GGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTA
with a lower 699 bp dsDNA handle and an upper 2271 bp dsDNA handle
was tethered specifically between an anti-digoxigenin-coated coverslip
and a streptavidin-coated super paramagnetic bead (Dynabeads MyOne
Streptavidin T1, Invitrogen) (Figure 1A). The kinetics of folding and unfolding of G-quadruplex
were measured in the absence or presence of hydrated intermediate
of cisplatin in a K+ buffer (100 mM CH3COOK,
10 mM Tris, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.0)
at 29 °C.

cisplatin from 317 and 159 unfolding events, respectively. The force-loading
rate was r = 0.2 pN/s. The lines represent the theoretical
fits (see text for details).

Magnetic Tweezers
The magnetic tweezers employed in
our experiments were from Pico Twist company (Lyon, France), and the
main protocol followed that used by Dekker and his co-worker.30,31 In the vertical magnetic tweezers system, all the DNA samples and
the buffer were contained by a flow cell. Two neodymium (NdFeB) permanent
magnets above the flow cell were used to provide an external magnetic
field that exerted a force on each paramagnetic bead and thus stretched
the corresponding G-quadruplex sequence. The force was controlled
by manipulating the position of the magnets and could achieve up to
20.0 pN in our experiments. The real-time images were recorded using
a JAI Giga-Ethernet charge-coupled device (CCD) camera at 60 Hz via
a vertical microscope objective (Olympus 100× 1.2, oil immersion).
Each bead in the image field was observed as a circular diffraction
ring. We tracked the horizontal coordinates of the bead by fitting
the center of the diffraction ring with an accuracy of ∼1 nm.
In addition, a calibration of the relative vertical coordinate was
carried out according to the diffraction ring pattern, which depended
on the distance between the bead and the focal plane with an accuracy
of ∼10 nm. Smoothing algorithm could improve the vertical resolution
to the nanometer level at the expense of time resolution.

DNA Construction
for Magnetic Tweezers Experiments
All oligonucleotides were
purchased from Invitrogen. All enzymes
and plasmids were purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc. (NEB).
The dsDNA handles were prepared using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification with pBR322 templates following a standard NEB protocol.
The primers were designed using Primer5.0. The PCR products were purified
using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and then digested by
restriction endonucleases XbaI and KpnI, respectively, to obtain sticky
ends that were just complementary to those of the central DNA complex
(see Tables S1 and S2). The digested products
were further purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. Finally,
the two dsDNA handles and the central DNA complex were ligated by
ligase T4 following the standard NEB protocol.

Surface Treatment and DNA
Tether
The inner surfaces
of the coverslips were dealt with 0.2% w/v nitrocellulose (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 0.03% w/v polystyrene particles (ACME microspheres) in alcohol
and then heated at 150 °C for 5 min.31 The nitrocellulose was slightly melted and polystyrene particles
were fixed on the surface as reference beads. Anti-digoxigenin (10
mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to treat the surface overnight at 37
°C. Then the surface was dealt with a passivation buffer [10
mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM pH 7.4 phosphate
buffers, 10 mg/mL Pluronic F127 surfactant (Sigma-Aldrich), 3 mM NaN3] at room temperature for at least 4 h, to avoid nonspecific
adherence of beads to the surface. The DNA constructs were diluted
to 50 pM, and mixed with 2× diluted Dynabeads MyOne with a volume
ratio of 1:1. The mixture was injected to the flow cell for DNA tethering.
After 15 min, the untethered DNA constructs were rinsed away.

Force
Calibration
An approximation that the same vertical
force was exerted on all the beads recorded by CCD at the same time
was introduced. Thus, the force depended only on the vertical position
of the magnets. The force can be determined by the horizontal Brownian
motion fluctuation (δx) and the vertical extension
of DNA (z) as30 1  

In our experiments, we analyzed the
Brownian motion of beads in the Fourier space to obtain more accurate
results.30 Longer measure time and longer
DNA construction also improved the accuracy. λ-DNA molecules
(48 502 bp) were used to calibrate the forces under various
magnetic positions (zmag) to obtain the
force–zmag curve (see Figure S1). A single-exponential function was
used empirically to fit the force–zmag relationship.32 In the force–ramp
and force–jump experiments, the force was determined by manipulating zmag according to the fitting formula. Considering
the nonuniformity of the magnetic moments of the beads and the error
of zmag, the relative error of force was
estimated to be ∼10%.

Circular Dichroism Spectra Measurements
Circular dichroism
(CD) spectra measurements were performed using a Bio-Logic MOS450/AF-CD
optical system (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, France). The DNA constructs
were dissolved in the working buffer (100 mM CH3COOK, 10
mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to 10 μM and processed, referring
to the usual annealing protocol (heated to 95 °C for 10 min and
cooled slowly to room temperature). For each measurement, 1.5 mL solution
of 1 μM DNA sample was contained in a quartz cell of 1 cm optical
path length. The DNA constructs were incubated for 30 min when measuring
with cisplatin. Spectra were recorded at each nanometer from 220 to
340 nm. Each curve was the average of 10 measurements and smoothed
with a Savitsky–Golay filter.33

DNA Construction for CD Measurements
All oligonucleotides
were purchased from Invitrogen. The same sequence 5′-GGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTA
with and without the 6 bp dsDNA handles on each side were employed
in CD measurements (see Table S3). As control,
a mutant sequence 5′-GGGTTATTATTAGGGTTAGGGTTA
that cannot fold to G-quadruplex was also measured.

Cisplatin
Cisplatin was purchased from the Institute
of Precious Metal in Kunming, China, as nitrates of hydrated intermediates.
It was first dissolved in deionized water (Milli-Q) to a concentration
of 3 μM at 37 °C for 24 h, under continuous shaking. Then
the solution was diluted to target concentration by the working buffer
(100 mM CH3COOK, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Chloridion
was excluded from the buffer to avoid inactivation of the reactive
cisplatin intermediate. According to our previous research,28,29 the dsDNA handles would not shorten under a cisplatin concentration
below 100 μM, which is just the case in our present magnetic
tweezers experiments. Thus, the interaction between cisplatin and
the dsDNA handles was considered not to affect our experiments.

In long-time incubation experiments, the DNA construct was held at
2 pN in a 20 μM cisplatin buffer for certain incubation times,
and then the refolding probability was measured.

Results and Discussion
To investigate the effect of cisplatin on the G-quadruplex folding/unfolding,
we carried out force–ramp experiments (Figure 1B). At the beginning of each stretching cycle,
G-quadruplex was first held at a low force of 2.0 pN for a holding
time of 60 s, which is long enough for the G-quadruplex to fold. Then
the force was increased linearly at a loading rate of r = 0.2 pN/s from 2.0 to 18.0 pN. The unfolding event of G-quadruplex
corresponds to a discontinuous extension jump of Δz = ∼7 nm (Figure 1B, upper panel, see Figure S2 for
more detail). When the force reached the 18.0 pN maximum, it was held
there for 60 s to assure that no folded G-quadruplex still exists
at the beginning of the next stretching cycle.

As mentioned
in a previous study,34 the
conformation of G-quadruplex would be quite sensitive on the environment.
To verify that the DNA constructs indeed formed a G-quadruplex structure
in our magnetic tweezers experiments, CD measurements were taken in
our working buffer (100 mM CH3COOK, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0). As shown in Figure 1C, the CD spectrum of the G-quadruplex sequence without
the dsDNA handles (blue) reveals two positive peaks around 290 and
260 nm and one negative peak around 240 nm, which is a typical CD
spectrum of hybrid conformation in K+ buffer. For the G-quadruplex
sequence with the 6 bp dsDNA handles (red), the characteristic peaks
are also identifiable in the CD spectrum. This indicates that the
DNA construct with the dsDNA handles can form G-quadruplexes of hybrid
conformation. It is worth noting that the peaks are shifted, especially
for the 290 nm peak. We attributed the shift to the CD spectrum of
the dsDNA handles in this DNA construct. The green dash curve is the
mutant sequence that cannot form G-quadruplex.

Shown in Figure 1D,E are the histograms
of unfolding force in the absence and the
presence of 10 μM cisplatin, respectively. In the absence of
cisplatin, the distribution exhibits a single peak (Figure 1D), which indicates that a
single stable G-quadruplex was formed under our buffer conditions.
Results of the single-molecule magnetic tweezers experiment are consistent
with those of a previous work,35 which
reveals that the human telomeric G-quadruplex sequence with a flanking
TTA at 3′ end had a major conformation of the hybrid-2 type.

To describe quantitatively the unfolding behavior of single G-quadruplexes
at a constant loading rate, we used Bell’s model.36 The unfolding rate (ku) in terms of tension (f) for a biomolecule can
be written as 2  where ku0 is the unfolding rate at f = 0 pN, Δxu is the transition
distance between the folding state and the reaction free-energy barrier
in the reaction coordinate (extension herein), kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the
temperature.36 The theoretical prediction26,37,38 of the unfolding force distribution
(punfold) at a certain loading rate (r) can be derived as 3  

Accordingly, the peak location of the unfolding
force is given
by , which
depends on the loading rate r.

From the histogram
fitted without cisplatin (Figure 1D), the peak position of the unfolding force
was found to be located at ∼9.0 pN. In the previous optical
tweezers measurements of human telomeric G-quadruplex,22 a higher unfolding force peak around 21 pN was
observed at a faster loading rate of r = 5.5 pN/s.
Both the previous fast-stretching experimental result and our present
result agree with Bell’s model mentioned above. In addition,
from the fitting, we obtained the unfolding rate at zero force as ku0 = (5.3 ± 1.5) × 10–3 s–1 (±SD, the same below) and the transition distance as Δxu = 1.00 ± 0.14 nm. It is worth noting
that Δxu is much smaller than the
extension of the G-quadruplex sequence (∼7 nm). This indicates
the high cooperativity of the hybrid-2-type G-quadruplex unfolding
under our experiment condition (K+ buffer). When a small
part of G-quadruplex is disrupted, the whole structure collapses cooperatively.

Different from the case without cisplatin, two peaks are exhibited
in the unfolding force histogram with 10 μM cisplatin (Figure 1E). This means that
two structures with different stabilities might be formed by the G-quadruplex
sequence. In our magnetic tweezers measurements, these two structures
were considered to unfold independently under tension, and a linear
combination of two unfolding force distributions p1 (high-force structure) and p2 (low-force structure) defined as p = ap1 + (1 – a)p2 was used to fit the histogram. From the fitting (Figure 1E), we infer that
the peak for the low-force structure centered around 9.0 pN, which
is the same as that in the case without cisplatin, indicating that
the low-force structure is the normal G-quadruplex structure. The
other peak centered around a higher force of 15.0 pN, suggesting that
G-quadruplex might become more stable because of cisplatin binding.
The fraction of the high-force population was determined to be ∼0.58.

For the low-force population, we obtained the unfolding rate at
zero force as ku20 = (4.0 ± 1.4) × 10–3 s–1, which is comparable to the unfolding rate
without cisplatin, further confirming the cisplatin-free nature of
the low-force structure. For the high-force population, we got the
unfolding rate at zero force as ku10 = (1.4 ± 1.5) ± 10–4 s–1, which is obviously smaller
than ku20, confirming the existence of a more-stable cisplatin-bound
state. The transition distances for cisplatin-bound and cisplatin-free
states were Δxu1 = 1.83 ± 0.34
nm and Δxu2 = 1.64 ± 0.27 nm,
respectively. Both values are close to 1.00 ± 0.14 nm in the
absence of cisplatin. This suggests that the binding of cisplatin
to G-quadruplex does not shift the position of the reaction energy
barrier obviously and the unfolding of cisplatin-bound G-quadruplex
also has a high cooperativity. The cisplatin-bound G-quadruplex is
also unfolded directly under the stretching force, and no intermediate
was observed in the experiments (K+ buffer).

To further
study this stable G-quadruplex found in the presence
of cisplatin and to reveal the binding kinetics of cisplatin onto
G-quadruplexes, we then determined the refolding probabilities at
different holding times by force–jump measurements. As shown
in Figure 2A, in each
cycle, the force was first held at 2.0 pN for a certain holding time
to allow G-quadruplex to form, then abruptly raised to 18.0 pN and
held at this level for 60 s to let the formed G-quadruplex unfold.
The abrupt force rise after low-force holding would avoid the folding
events that might occur at the initial low-force region of force–ramp
experiments. Here, an unfolding event also corresponds to a discontinuous
extension jump of Δz = ∼7 nm (Figure 2A, see Figure S2 for more detail). With a DNA construct,
the measurement was repeatedly taken up to 50 times for a given holding
time. The refolding probability was then calculated by dividing the
number of unfolding events by the number of total repeating cycles.

experiments. A typical DNA extension versus time curve (upper panel)

errors. The lines represent theoretical fits (see text for details).
(C) A representative histogram of the unfolding force obtained in
a corresponding force–ramp experiment (30 s holding time, 434
unfolding events), from the fitting of which the population ratio
of the cisplatin-free and the cisplatin-bound states can be obtained.
(D) Refolding probabilities of the cisplatin-free and the cisplatin-bound
states.

Figure 2B shows
the G-quadruplex refolding probability versus holding time in the
absence and the presence of 10 μM cisplatin. Each data point
is a weighted average of data from 16–65 DNA constructs. As
can be seen clearly, G-quadruplex in the presence of 10 μM cisplatin
has a higher probability to refold than in a cisplatin-free buffer.

The G-quadruplex refolding probability in the cisplatin-free buffer
could be derived from the simple two-state model, 4  From the fitting of the data curve in Figure 2B (see “Two-State
Model Fitting” in Supporting Information), the refolding and unfolding rates in the cisplatin-free buffer
were determined as k1 = (8.2 ± 0.7)
× 10–3 s–1 and k2 = (3.6 ± 0.4) × 10–2 s–1. Thus, the refolding rate k1 is smaller than the unfolding rate k2 at a 2.0 pN stretching force. This indicates that the stretching
force makes the unfolding state more preferred than the folding state
in the cisplatin-free buffer.

The refolding probability in the
case with cisplatin should be
the sum of the probabilities for cisplatin-bound and cisplatin-free
states. To determine the probabilities of the two states at a given
holding time, we performed corresponding force–ramp experiments.
The histograms of the unfolding force were then fitted by a linear
combination of two distributions as before, and with the areas under
the fitting curves of two peaks, the probabilities of the two states
were obtained (Figure 2C,D).

In the presence of cisplatin, a sequential three-state
model might
be used to describe the G-quadruplex folding/unfolding dynamics: 5  

As shown in Figure 2D, the refolding probabilities of both cisplatin-bound
and cisplatin-free
states increased with increasing holding time and reached equilibrium
at around 80 s. Their ratio, however, remained almost a constant (∼0.6)
from 10 to 120 s (see “Sequential Transition Model Fitting”
in Supporting Information). This indicates
that in the three-state transition processes, the folding of G-quadruplex
(i.e., ssDNA to G4) is the rate-determining step. The process of cisplatin
binding to free G-quadruplex (i.e., G4 to G4–cisplatin complex)
should be much more rapid and can be regarded as a quasi-equilibrium
progress. Thus, we might approximately treat the two G-quadruplex
states as a single equivalent state and simplify the three-state model
to a two-state one (see “Sequential Transition Model Fitting”
in Supporting Information). Then, by fitting
the refolding probability data at 10 μM cisplatin in Figure 2B using the equivalent
two-state model, we obtained k12 = (9.2
± 1.7) × 10–3 s–1 and k21 = (6.1 ± 1.8) × 10–2 s–1. As expected, these two values are similar
to that of k1 and k2 in the absence of cisplatin.

Considering that the binding
of cisplatin to free G-quadruplex
is a quasi-equilibrium progress, the rates k23 and k32 have a linear relation k23/k32 = a/(1 – a) (see “Sequential
Transition Model Fitting” in Supporting Information). The free-energy difference between the cisplatin-bound
and cisplatin-free states at a force of 2.0 pN was estimated as ΔG = ln[a/(1 – a)]/kBT ≈ 0.4kBT in the presence of 10 μM
cisplatin. To obtain the rates k23 and k32, experiments with higher temporal resolution
need to be carried out.

A series of force–jump measurements
were then carried out
to obtain the refolding probabilities at different cisplatin concentrations.
As shown in Figure 3A, at a holding time of 60 s and a holding force of 2.0 pN, the refolding
probability reached the maximum at 10 μM cisplatin and then
dramatically decreased at higher cisplatin concentrations. Finally,
the refolding event was nearly inhibited completely at
100 μM cisplatin.

The refolding probability increased at 10 μM, but dramatically
decreased at higher concentrations. Every column is a weighted average
of 16 to 45 DNA constructs. The error bars are standard errors (the
same as in C). (B) Unfolding force histogram obtained from the corresponding
force–ramp experiments with 232, 215, and 121 unfolding events,
respectively. At different concentrations of cisplatin, peaks for

of the quadruplex sequence and the mutant sequence (see text for details)
at a cisplatin concentration of 100 μM (red), 200 μM (blue),
and 500 μM (green).

CD experiments were also conducted for the G-quadruplex and
the
mutant sequence. As shown in Figure 3D,E, the CD spectra of the G-quadruplex sequence (5′-(GGGTTA)4) and the mutant sequence (5′-GGGTTATTATTAGGGTTAGGGTTA)
at 100 μM (red), 200 μM (blue), and 500 μM (green)
cisplatin were measured, respectively. For the G-quadruplex sequence
(Figure 3D), CD spectra
at 100 and 200 μM exhibited the characteristic peaks of hybrid
G-quadruplex (positive peaks around 290 and 260 nm, negative peak
around 240 nm). However, the CD spectrum at 500 μM did not reveal
these peaks. The heights of the character peaks also receded with
the increasing cisplatin concentration. As controls, the CD spectra
of the mutant sequence (Figure 3E) did not exhibit the characteristic peaks at all cisplatin
concentrations. The results of the CD experiments indicated that for
the G-quadruplex sequence, hybrid conformation G-quadruplexes obviously
formed at a low cisplatin concentration and were gradually destabilized
at a high cisplatin concentration. This result agreed with our magnetic
tweezers experiments. It is worth noting that the complete destabilization
of G-quadruplex occurred at a higher cisplatin concentration in the
CD experiments (500 μM) than in the magnetic tweezers experiments
(100 μM). We attributed this to the much higher concentration
of DNA constructs in CD measurements (∼μM) than in single-molecule
magnetic tweezers experiments (∼pM).

Previous studies
based on CD spectroscopy, UV-spectroscopically
monitored thermal denaturation, and gel-electrophoresis have also
reported that cisplatin is capable of binding to the G-quadruplex
sequences and destabilizing the G-quadruplex structures.19−21 The adducts formed by cisplatin were proposed to cause the destabilization.
Activated cisplatin can attack the N7 atoms of guanines to form adducts
by covalent bonds,15,16 which are strong and difficult
to rupture. In a G-tetrad of G-quadruplexes, the N7 atoms of guanines
are involved in the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds, which are critical in
G-quadruplex folding.1 When the N7 atom in
a guanine of the G-quadruplex sequence is bound with cisplatin, should
one Hoogsteen hydrogen bond fail to form, the whole G-quadruplex may
collapse.

To verify this, corresponding force–ramp experiments
were
conducted at 10, 20, and 50 μM cisplatin and the unfolding force
histograms are shown in Figure 3B. At different cisplatin concentrations, the peaks for both
cisplatin-free and cisplatin-bound states can be observed, which revealed
that the binding of cisplatin to G-quadruplex reached saturation because
the ratio between the populations of the two states was invariable.
Thus, it should not be the reversible binding of cisplatin to G-quadruplex
that caused the decrease in the refolding probability at high cisplatin
concentrations. Our previous studies revealed that the number of cisplatin
molecules that form covalent bonds with guanines depends strongly
on the cisplatin concentration, which was proposed to be caused by the cationic charges
of the cisplatin molecules.39 Thus, we
propose here that at low cisplatin concentrations (≤10 μM),
only a few cisplatin molecules formed adducts with N7 atoms of guanines
in the G-quadruplex sequence. The reversible binding was dominating,
and the refolding probability was relatively high. When the cisplatin
concentration was increased, more and more cisplatin adducts were
formed and, irreversibly, the sequences were unable to fold to G-quadruplex.
This caused the decrease in refolding probability at higher cisplatin
concentrations. According to population pharmacokinetics, the peak
concentration of unbound cisplatin in plasma is usually less than
3000 μg/L.40 The concentration of
uptake cisplatin accumulation in the target cells is ∼10 μM
at most.18,41 At this relatively low cisplatin concentration,
the reversible binding of cisplatin should play a nonignorable role.

To investigate the property of cisplatin adducts, refolding probabilities
with 20 μM cisplatin and 60 s holding time at 2.0 pN were measured
for different incubation times. As shown in Figure 3C, the refolding probabilities remained invariable
in an incubation time range of 10 h. Earlier studies revealed that
the process of cisplatin to form a monoadduct with a single guanine
is fast and takes <10 min, but the progress to further form a diadduct
with another guanine needs a much longer time (in hours).39 The present experiment revealed that a monoadduct
formed by a relatively fast reaction is sufficient to avoid G-quadruplex
folding.

In summary, we have revealed two ways of interaction
between cisplatin
and the G-quadruplex sequence as shown in Figure 4. Cisplatin molecules can bind reversibly
to G-quadruplexes to form a kind of more stable complexes. On the
other hand, they can also bind irreversibly to guanines in the G-quadruplex
sequences to avoid folding. These two ways of interactions compete
with each other under different cisplatin concentrations in a buffer.
At a low concentration, the reversible way dominates and the refolding
probability increases with concentration. However, at a high concentration,
the irreversible way dominates and the refolding probability decreases
and finally vanishes. As a tiny molecular inorganic compound, cisplatin
shows promising potential to react with G-quadruplex, which suggests
that the interaction between small molecules and G-quadruplex should
be investigated.

Figure 4 Model proposed to describe the interaction between cisplatin
and
a G-quadruplex sequence. See text for details.
