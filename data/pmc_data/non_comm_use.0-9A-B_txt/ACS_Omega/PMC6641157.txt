The effect of substitution on the
potential energy surfaces of
RIn≡AsR (R = F, OH, H, CH3, and SiH3 and
R′ = SiMe(SitBu3)2,
SiiPrDis2, and N-heterocyclic
carbene (NHC)) is determined using density functional theory calculations
(M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP, and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp). The computational
studies demonstrate that all of the triply bonded RIn≡AsR species
prefer to adopt a bent geometry, which is consistent with the valence
electron model. The theoretical studies show that RIn≡AsR molecules
that have smaller substituents are kinetically unstable with respect
to their intramolecular rearrangements. However, triply bonded R′In≡AsR′
species that have bulkier substituents (R′ = SiMe(SitBu3)2, SiiPrDis2, and NHC) occupy minima on the singlet potential energy surface,
and they are both kinetically and thermodynamically stable. That is,
the electronic and steric effects of bulky substituents play an important
role in making molecules that feature an In≡As triple bond
viable as a synthetic target. Moreover, two valence bond models are
used to interpret the bonding character of the In≡As triple
bond. One is model [A], which is best represented as . This interprets the bonding
conditions for RIn≡AsR molecules that feature small ligands.
The other is model [B], which is best represented as . This explains the bonding
character of RIn≡PAsR molecules that feature large substituents.

I Introduction
Although
triply bonded compounds (RE14≡E14R) that
have group 14 elements have been experimentally1−6 and theoretically7 studied extensively,
similar isovalent systems (RE13≡E15R)
that feature group 13 and group 15 elements have not been the subject
of as many studies.8,9 This study focuses on molecules
that have an indium≡arsenic triple bond, to determine whether
these triply bonded molecules can be synthesized and isolated as stable
compounds when they are properly substituted. These organoindium–arsenic
compounds are attractive objects of study because indium arsenide
(InAs) is one of the narrow bandgap group 13–15 semiconductors
(Eg = 0.35 eV, 3543 nm) and has a large
excitonic diameter (62 nm),10 so these
species play a prominent role in semiconductor clusters and in material
chemistry.11 No related studies have been
found that determine the effect of substituents on molecular systems
that have an indium≡arsenic triple bond; thus, this is the
first report that uses theoretical methods for the synthesis of triply
bonded In≡As molecules that have various substituents. The
theoretical explanations for the effect of substituents (R = F, OH,
H, CH3, and SiH3 and R′ = SiMe(SitBu3)2,12 SiiPrDis2,12 and NHC;13Scheme 1) that are described should allow the synthesis
of triply bonded indium≡arsenic molecules.

Ligands Used in This Work
II General Considerations
To gain a better
understanding about the attributes of the In≡As
triple bonds in both RIn≡AsR and R′In≡AsR′
species, it is constructive to regard RIn≡AsR as being constructed
by R–In and R–As fragments (for convenience, R is used
here instead of R′).14,15 Then, comprehension
of the singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST) of both R–In and R–As units can help
us to deliberate the bonding situations of their In≡As triple
bonds. Two bonding models between R–In and R–As moieties
are likely for the triply bonded RIn≡AsR molecule as schematically
shown in Figure 1.
According to our density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see
below), it is known that R–In and R–As units exist as
a singlet and a triplet, respectively, in the ground state.

Figure 1 Valence bond
bonding models [A] and [B] for the triply bonded RIn≡AsR
molecule.

On the one hand, the greater stability
of the singlet state of
the R–In fragment than its triplet state can result in the
triplet ground state of R–As being promoted to the singlet
excited state because of its smaller promotion energy (ΔE1). Therefore, the bonding mode [A] can be obtained.
In this bonding model, three features must be noted as follows: (i)
The most fundamental difference between indium and arsenic elements
lies in their covalent radii (1.50 and 1.21 Å, respectively),16 which is owing to their various core electronic
structures.17 (ii) From Figure 1, the bonding characters of
the In≡As triple bond are considered to be one donor–acceptor
σ bond and two donor–acceptor π bonds, which can
be viewed as . (iii) Because the lone pair orbital of the R–As moiety
contains the valence s orbital of arsenic, it is predicted that the
overlap between the p−π orbital of R–In and the
lone pair orbital of R–As should be small. Accordingly, from
mode [A], one may predict that the In≡As triple bond is very
weak, which will be verified theoretically in the following sections.

On the other hand, the higher stability of the triplet state of
the R–As component than its singlet state can lead to the singlet
ground state of R–In being excited to the triplet excited state
based on its smaller advancement energy (ΔE2). As a result, the valence bond mode [B] can be acquired.
As seen in Figure 1, it has to be noted that the In≡As triple bond in mode [B]
is described as one conventional σ bond, one conventional π
bond, and one donor–acceptor π bond, which can be represented
as . Similar
to the nature of mode [A], one may foresee from mode [B] that the
In≡As triple bond is feeble, which will be certified on the
basis of the present DFT calculations.

As a consequence, the
above bonding analyses demonstrate that the
singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST) of both R–In and R–As components should
play a decisive role in the discussion of the triple bond characteristics
in the RIn≡AsR molecules.

III Results and Discussion
III.1 Small Ligands on Substituted RIn≡AsR
For small ligands, such as R = F, OH, H, CH3, and SiH3, three different methods of DFT calculations are used (i.e.,
M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP, and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp) to determine
the molecular properties of triply bonded RIn≡AsR species.
The key geometrical parameters, the singlet–triplet energy
splitting (ΔEST = Etriplet – Esinglet),
the natural charge densities (QIn and QAs), the binding energies (BEs), and the highest
occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(HOMO–LUMO) energy gaps are summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, the key parameters
for the RIn≡AsR triply bonded compounds
are closer to each other at the M06-2X, B3PW91, and B3LYP levels used.
The computational data in Table 1 indicate that the In≡As bond distances, which
fall in the range of 2.411–2.512, 2.399–2.497, and 2.432–2.546
Å, change significantly when there is a substitution. Additionally,
all three DFT calculations that are shown in Table 1 demonstrate that both the R–In and
the R–As units have a singlet and triplet ground state separately.
Besides these, the three DFT calculations reveal that the sum of ΔEST for R–In and R–As fragments
are at least +11 (M06-2X), +16 (B3PW91), and +13 (B3LYP) kcal/mol.
These sums of ΔEST values strongly
suggest that the bonding pattern for the triply bonded RIn≡AsR
molecule possessing small ligands is best described by the bonding
mode [A] that is shown in Figure 1. In particular, this bonding model analysis allows
two important conclusions to be drawn. The bonding illustrations that
are given in Figure 1 show that the RIn≡AsR triple bond compound favors a bent
structure (mode [A]) rather than the linear structure. This prediction
is confirmed by the three DFT calculations that are summarized in Table 1. Also, the bonding
model [A] demonstrates that the stability of this bent geometry for
the RIn≡AsR triple bond compound with small substituents is
largely due to the RIn ← AsR donor–acceptor interaction.
As mentioned previously, the triple bond in the RIn≡AsR compounds
bearing the small groups can be depicted as follows: . Especially, the valence
bond model [A] anticipates that its In≡As triple bond would
be very weak. Indeed, this prediction is confirmed by the present
three DFT calculations. The WBI18 for the
In≡As bond collected in Table 1 is estimated to be 1.54–1.77 (M06-2X), 1.55–1.80
(B3PW91), and 1.56–1.78 (B3LYP). That is, our theoretical observations
strongly suggest that the RIn≡AsR molecule featuring the small
substituents should possess a weak double bond rather than a the triple
bond. Accordingly, these data are significant evidence that the small
ligands (R) that are studied in this work cannot effectively yield
triply bonded RIn≡AsR molecules.

To determine the stability
of the triply bonded RIn≡AsR
molecules, three theoretical methods (M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP,
and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp) are used to study the potential energy surfaces
for the unimolecular rearrangement reaction of the RIn≡AsR
(R = F, OH, H, CH3, and SiH3) species. The reaction
profiles for these are shown in Figure 2. This figure shows that there are three local minima
(R2In=As:, RIn≡AsR, and :In=AsR2), which are connected by two saddle points. Figure 2 shows that regardless of the
type of small substituents that are attached, the triply bonded RIn≡AsR
compounds could be unstable on the potential energy surfaces and easily
undergo a 1,2-migration reaction to produce the most stable isomers,
which contain an In=As double bond. This theoretical study
shows that there is a slim possibility of observing RInAsR molecules
that feature an In≡As triple bond in a transient intermediate
or even in a matrix (in a low-temperature experiment).

and are calculated at the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP, and
B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp levels of theory. For details, see Supporting Information.

III.2 Large Ligands on Substituted R′In≡AsR′
It is easy to imagine that bulky substituents (R′) should
destabilize both R′2In=As: and :In=AsR′2 isomers because of severe steric congestions. This, in turn,
makes the triply bonded R′In≡AsR′ molecules as
stable as possible. The occurrence of extraordinarily bulky substituents
at both ends of the R′In≡AsR′ species protects
its In≡As triple bond from attack by another substance. Three
types of bulky substituents (Scheme 1) are used to determine the effect of substituents
on the stability of the indium≡arsenic triple bond. The structures
for R′In≡AsR′ that are optimized at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp//RHF/3-21G*
level of theory are summarized in Table 2.

j ΔHa = E(head–tail trimer) – 3E(R′In≡AsR′); see Scheme 3.

The theoretical calculations that are shown in Table 2 predict that the
In≡As
triple bond distance (Å) in the three bulkily substituted R′In≡AsR′
species is 2.446 (R′ = SiMe(SitBu3)2), 2.430 (R′ = SiiPrDis2), and 2.482 (R′ = NHC). These values are close to
the previously calculated bond length for In≡As in RIn≡AsR
molecules that contain small electropositive substituents (Table 1). Additionally, the
present DFT results for the |ΔEST| values (kcal/mol) of R′–In and R′–As
fragments are estimated to be 16–33 and 12–16, respectively.
These smaller excitation energies for the bulkier R′–In
unit, compared with the higher excitation energies for the smaller
R–In moiety (Table 1), strongly suggest that the bonding pattern of the R′In≡AsR′
species should select mode [B], as demonstrated in Figure 1. Namely, two triplet components
([R′–In]3 and [R′–As]3) combine together to produce the triply bonded R′In≡AsR′
molecule at the singlet ground state. In consequence, as seen in mode
[B] in Figure 1, the
bonding character in the triply bonded R′In≡AsR′
compound featuring the bulkier substituents is regarded as , in which the donor–acceptor
π bond plays a prominent role in determining its In≡As
triple bond. It has to be emphasized here that there exist two factors
that affect the degree of the In≡As triple bond. One is that
the lone pair orbitals of both R′–In and R′–As
units contain the valence s characters. The other is that the sizes
of the valence p orbitals for both bulkier fragments are quite different.
As a result, one can easily envision that the In≡As triple
bond in such R′In≡AsR′ species should be very
weak, unlike the traditional C≡C triple bond in acetylene.
Indeed, the present DFT evidence given in Table 2 indicate that the WBI for SiMe(SitBu3)2–In≡As–SiMe(SitBu3)2, SiiPrDis2–In≡As–SiiPrDis2, and NHC–In≡As–NHC is estimated to be
2.17, 2.27, and 2.14, respectively. This strongly demonstrates that
the triple bond between the In and As atoms is quite weak because
the WBI of the C≡C triple bond of acetylene was computed to
be 2.99 at the same level of theory. Further, similar to the case
of RIn≡AsR bearing small ligands, the geometrical structures
for R′In≡AsR′ shown in Table 2 all adopt a bent form, which can be easily
interpreted using the valence electron model [B]. The reason for having
such bent geometries can also be attributed to the orbital nonhybridization
effect or the inert s-pair effect, as discussed previously.19

Besides these, the BEs for the dissociation
reaction, R′In≡AsR′
→ R′–In (triplet state) + R′–As
(triplet state), are calculated to be 42, 45, and 36 kcal/mol for
the SiMe(SitBu3)2, SiiPrDis2, and NHC substituents, respectively.
Compared with small substituents (Table 1), these BE values give convincing evidence
that the central In and As atoms in these bulkily substituted R′In≡AsR′
molecules are strongly bonded.

As previously stated, bulky groups
can destabilize the 1,2-R′
migrated isomers because they crowd around one end of the central
indium–arsenic bond as R′2In=As: and
:In=AsR′2 (Scheme 2). Therefore, it
is anticipated that bulky groups (R′) prevent the isomerization
of R′In≡AsR′ species. The B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp calculations
show that R′In≡AsR′ compounds that contain SiMe(SitBu3)2, SiiPrDis2, and NHC groups (ΔH1 and
ΔH2) are, respectively, at least
69, 76, and 72 kcal/mol more stable than the corresponding 1,2-R′
shifted isomers. Accordingly, the theoretical evidence strongly suggests
that these bulkier substituents can greatly protect the central In≡As
triple bond.

Scheme 2 1,2-R′ Shift Reactions for the R′In≡AsR′
Molecules that Contain SiMe(SitBu3)2 and SiiPrDis2 Substituents
Because it is possible that
the three R′In≡AsR′
molecules undergo trimerization reactions to yield a benzene-like
product (Scheme 3), DFT is used to calculate the relevant
reaction enthalpies (ΔHa), and the
results are shown in Table 2. This table shows that these ΔHa energies (at least 224 kcal/mol) are so large that the bulky
R′In≡AsR′ compounds cannot undergo the trimerization
reactions because these reactions are prevented by the crowding that
occurs when there are six bulky substituents.

Scheme 3 Trimerization Reactions
for the R′In≡AsR′ Molecules
That Contain SiMe(SitBu3)2 and
SiiPrDis2 Substituents
NBO18 and NRT20 are also used to determine the electronic structures
of the R′In≡AsR′
molecules. These are calculated at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp level of theory,
and the results are shown in Table 3. For instance, the NBO18 analyses for the In≡As π bonding in SiMe(SitBu3)2–In≡As–SiMe(SitBu3)2 also give NBO(In≡As)
π⊥ = 0.441(5s5p2.80)In + 0.898(4s4p4.33)As. This demonstrates that the primary bonding interaction
between the SiMe(SitBu3)2–In
and the SiMe(SitBu3)2–As
units is a result of 5p(In) ← 4p(As) donation. That is, both
an electron deficiency in the In element and the π bond polarity
are partially equalized by the donation of the lone pair from arsenic
into the empty p orbital of indium. As seen in Table 3, 19.5% of the In≡As bonding orbital
is made up of natural In orbitals and 80.6% is natural As orbitals
(Figure 3). Other supporting
evidence that is seen in Table 3 is that the In≡As triple bond in this compound has
a shorter single bond character (5.78%) and a shorter triple bond
character (39.0%), but a larger double bond character (55.2%). The
covalent part of its NRT bond order (1.55) is also longer than the
ionic part (0.76). The same is true for SiiPrDis2–In≡As–SiiPrDis2, as shown in Table 3.21 This theoretical analysis shows
that R′In≡AsR′ molecules that feature bulky substituents
(R′) have a weak triple bond.

b NRT, see ref (20).

It has to be mentioned here that the NHC system is
totally different
from the other two bulkier compounds because NHC is a well-known strong
donating ligand.13 As a result, the NHC
ligand (Scheme 1) would
be stabilizing the In≡As: component as a strong monovalent
donor. That is, in the case of R′ = SiMe(SitBu3)2 or SiiPrDis2, R′–In and R′–As are covalent bonds.
However, in the case of R′ = NHC, both NHC → In and
NHC → As are donating bonds. Therefore, the (NHC)In≡As(NHC)
molecule can be considered to be “donor-stabilized (coordinated)
In≡As:”.

IV Conclusions
This
study uses both small and bulky groups to determine the effect
of substituents on the stability of triply bonded RIn≡AsR molecules.
The theoretical observations show that both the electronic and steric
effects of substituents play a key role in making triply bonded RIn≡AsR
synthetically accessible. It should be noted that the triple bond
in the R′In≡AsR′ species, which is attached by
bulky substituents (R′), is shown to be quite weak. These theoretical
findings strongly suggest that the R′In≡AsR′
compounds that feature bulky substituents are easily stabilized because
bulky substituents not only protect the central In≡As triple
bond because there is a large steric hindrance but also prevent oligomerization
reactions.

V Theoretical Methods
Triply bonded RIn≡AsR
molecules have smaller ligands that
consist of both organic groups (i.e., R = F, OH, H, CH3, and SiH3) and larger groups (i.e., R′ = SiMe(SitBu3)2,12 SiiPrDis2,12 and NHC;13Scheme 1) and are studied using the hybrid DFT, using
the Gaussian 09 program package.22 All
RIn≡AsR geometries for molecules with smaller ligands (R) are
fully optimized at the M06-2X23/Def2-TZVP,24 B3PW9125,26/Def2-TZVP, and B3LYP25,27/LANL2DZ+dp28 levels of theory. Frequency
calculations are executed for all structures to ensure that the transition
states have only one imaginary frequency and that the reactants and
products have no imaginary frequencies. The relative free energies
(ΔG) at 298 K are corrected at the same levels
of theory.

For bulky groups (R′), the limitations of
both central processing
unit (CPU) time and disk memory size mean that the RHF/3-21G* calculation
is used to fully optimize SiMe(SitBu3)2–In≡As–SiMe(SitBu3)2, SiiPrDis2–In≡As–SiiPrDis2, and NHC–In≡As–NHC.
The frequencies are also computed for triply bonded R′–In≡As–R′
systems using the RHF/3-21G* method to confirm whether they are minima
(no imaginary frequency) or transition states (only one imaginary
frequency). To produce better energetics, the stationary points are
further computed at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp//RHF/3-21G* level of theory.
The Cartesian coordinates, the natural bond orbitals (NBOs),18 and the natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses20 that are computed in this work at the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP,
B3PW91/Def2-TZVP, and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp levels of theory are available

It has to be pointed out
that due to electropositive
silyl groups (SiMe(SitBu3)2 and SiiPrDis2), the lone pairs at indium
and arsenic elements would exhibit p-character to large extent, making
the p−π donation much stronger. As a result, their angle
∠R′–In–As is less than 180° and the
angle ∠In–As–R′ is about 120°.
