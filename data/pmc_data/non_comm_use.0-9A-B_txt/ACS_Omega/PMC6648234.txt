Quantification
of natural carbonate minerals, namely, aragonite,
high- and low-Mg calcite, and dolomite provides essential information
about biomineralization, carbon cycling on Earth, and the evolution
of ocean chemistry, and is also useful in many other scientific, pharmaceutical,
and industrial fields. However, X-ray diffractometer has previously
been the only practical tool to identify and quantify carbonate minerals,
including calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs. We propose
new fingerprint terahertz (THz) absorption and reflective index spectra
in the 1–6 THz range that probe the lattice phonon modes and
can be used for sensitive quantification of these four carbonate minerals,
including polymorphs. In THz time-domain spectroscopy with our unique
attenuated total reflection system, high- and low-Mg calcite and aragonite
show different absorbance and reflective index amplitudes at 3.32
THz, which corresponds to the transverse optic mode. Dolomite shows
a distinct absorbance peak and reflective index at 4.82 THz because
its space group (R3̅) is different from that
of calcite (R3̅c). THz absorbance
and reflective index curves of the mixed carbonate materials, which
typically occur in natural environments, correspond well to the curves
calculated from the results of single-mineral samples (R2 > 0.98). Remarkably, the absorbance and reflective
index
can quantify small fractions (<1%) of low-Mg calcite in an aragonite
matrix with high linearity (R2 = 0.99).
Our findings provide a new method for screening low-Mg calcite diagenetic
overprints on primary aragonitic skeletons such as corals, which is
crucial for climate reconstructions using the isotopic analyses because
a 1% overprint can cause estimated temperature deviations of ∼1
°C. THz spectra of carbonate minerals offer not only a new high-sensitivity
quantification tool for interdisciplinary fields, but also safer light-source
handling than X-ray diffractometer.

1 Introduction
Carbonate
minerals have provided essential information in diverse
fields of scientific, pharmaceutical, and industrial researches such
as the Earth’s climate and history,1 oil and gas reservoir detection,2,3 planetary systems,
and identification of the origin of aeolian dust.4 In pharmaceuticals and industrials, differentiating and
imaging different carbonate minerals are important for assuring sufficient
quality of the active pharmaceutical ingredient5 for analyzing coatings and/or filler pigments and extenders
in the paper making and printing industries,6 and for reinforcing rubber and plastic.7 Carbonate minerals have been also used as the most common pigments
and substrates for wall painting since ancient times.6 Therefore, determining the original composition of the
carbonate minerals is important for the conservation of art and cultural
property.8

Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the most common carbonate
mineral and exists as the crystal polymorphs, calcite, aragonite,
and vaterite. Vaterite is rare in nature and is likely to occur only
as a transient intermediate from an amorphous calcium carbonate precursor
phase to more stable calcite or aragonite.9 Calcite is divided into high- and low-Mg calcite, according to its
Mg content (>4 mol %).10 In the modern
marine environment, aragonite and high-Mg calcite are two major constituents
that form biominerals and cement. Dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2, is another common carbonate mineral that frequently forms
depositional and diagenetic layers in ancient shallow-water sediments.

A wide variety of analytical techniques have been used to identify
Ca–Mg carbonate minerals, including X-ray diffractometry (XRD),
differential scanning calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
hyperspectral imaging, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements,
a combination of X-ray photoelectron and time-of-flight secondary
ion mass spectroscopies,5,11 and shortwave infrared
hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy.12 However,
XRD is the only practical tool for quantifying all Ca–Mg carbonate
minerals.13−16 Recently, terahertz (THz) pulsed spectroscopy has been proposed
as a potential tool for characterizing crystalline properties of solid
materials by probing the lattice phonon modes, which occur in the
far-infrared range, especially below 18 THz (600 cm–1).4,5 Therefore, the center of the THz region, 0–10
THz, which bridges the gap between the infrared and microwave regions,
covers a series of unique crystal fingerprints. The recent revolution
in terahertz pulsed time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) enables the
direct measurement of the transient electric field of THz radiation.
This method yields THz spectra with far better sensitivity, a wider
dynamic range, and a higher signal-to-noise ratio compared with Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.17 So far, only THz absorption spectra from 0 to 4 THz by THz-TDS have
been reported for aragonite and calcite,3,8 but not for
dolomite. In addition, the absorption spectrum of calcite does not
distinguish low- and high-Mg calcite, and the reflective indices of
low- and high-Mg calcite are not available.

Herein, we propose
new THz absorption spectra and the reflective
indices of main natural Ca–Mg carbonate minerals, aragonite,
high- and low-Mg calcite, and dolomite for high-sensitivity quantification
using our THz-TDS method from 1 to 6 THz. Our THz-TDS method uses
a unique attenuated total reflection (ATR) system, in which the ATR
prism is directly bonded to the THz detector and generator. The ATR
structure of the THz-TDS instrument (Figure S1) prevents THz wave absorption by water vapor, reducing the total
reflection loss and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio18,19 compared with conventional THz-TDS.5 Our
study provides a new spectroscopic tool for the high-sensitivity quantification
of carbonate minerals as an alternative to XRD.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Absorbance and Reflective
Index of Ca–Mg
Carbonate Minerals
The carbonate minerals analyzed in this
study were aragonite (coral Porites sp.), high-Mg
calcite (11.6 mol % Mg; large foraminifera Cycloclypeus sp.),13,20 low-Mg calcite (0.6 mol % Mg; Jurassic Solnhofen
limestone from Germany), and dolomite (Ediacaran Dengying Formation
from China), and the mineralogies of which were confirmed by XRD (Figure S2). Elemental concentrations of the minerals
were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES). The dolomite sample had a nearly stoichiometric ratio of
Ca and Mg (51.3 mol % Ca and 48.7 mol % Mg; Table S1).

We performed 10 THz-TDS measurements of the low-Mg
calcite sample. The values in the 1–6 THz range have an absorbance
of less than 0.1 (1 standard error (SE)) and a reflective index of
less than 0.004 (1 SE) (Figure 1a,b), although the SE of both indices increase with frequency,
suggesting that our ATR technique with THz-TDS is reliable. We obtained
the absorbance and reflective index spectra, which were unique for
aragonite, high- and low-Mg calcite, and dolomite (Figure 1a,b). The absorbance of low-Mg
calcite, the most stable calcium carbonate polymorph, shows a clear
peak at 3.32 THz that corresponds to the center point of frequencies
between the maximum (2.97 THz) and minimum (3.61 THz) reflective indices.
Although a relevant absorbance peak at 3.32 THz appears for high-Mg
calcite, patterns of the THz spectra are flattened (Figure 1). The transition from the
low-Mg calcite spectrum to the high-Mg calcite spectrum is due to
the change in the vibration mode caused by Mg substitution. Magnesite
has a different vibration frequency from calcite,21 and the Mg bond probably generates no signals in the 0–6
THz range. The THz spectra are sensitive to Mg substitution, and there
are distinct differences between low- and high-Mg calcite, whereas
the XRD spectra only show a slight difference in peak positioning
(Figure S2). Aragonite, which has an orthorhombic
system instead of a hexagonal system in calcite, shows flatter patterns
for both the absorbance and reflective index, whereas its absorbance
has a broad peak with the center at 3.32 THz, the same center position
as peaks of high- and low-Mg calcite. The maximum absorbance at 3.32
THz is a unique characteristic of calcium carbonates that is probably
reflected from an out-of-plane vibration and an in-plane vibration
of the carbonate group,8 which correspond
to the transverse optic mode in earlier studies.21,22 Dolomite has different absorption and reflective index patterns
from calcium carbonate samples. Dolomite shows a clear absorbance
peak at 4.82 THz that corresponds to the center point between the
maximum (4.63 THz) and minimum (5.11 THz) reflective indices. Higher
frequencies of the dolomite absorption peak and reflective index are
likely related to the different space groups of calcite (R3̅c) and dolomite (R3̅),
although calcite and dolomite belong to the same hexagonal crystal
system.21 These results are consistent
with previous studies of the far-infrared spectra using FTIR, which
found a strong peak for calcite and a minor peak for aragonite at
approximately the same frequency of 110 cm–1 (3.3
THz) and a strong peak for dolomite at a slightly different frequency
of 160 cm–1 (4.8 THz).4,6 Thus, mineralogy-specific
absorbance and reflective indices for Ca–Mg carbonate minerals
appear from 2.0 to 5.5 THz.

Figure 1 (a) Absorbance and (b) reflective index of the
carbonate minerals
(aragonite, high- and low-Mg calcite, and dolomite) in the 1–6
THz range. Each mineral shows distinctive characteristics, which can
be used to identify the carbonate polymorphs. SE was evaluated by
10 measurements of the low-Mg calcite sample.

2.2 Quantification of Mixtures of Aragonite, High-
and Low-Mg Calcite, and Dolomite
Four sets of mixtures of
different minerals were prepared to examine the suitability of THz-TDS
for quantifying mineral composition (Figure 2). The first and second sets were mixtures
of two minerals selected from aragonite and low- and high-Mg calcite,
which are common biomineralization products, paper coating, and filler
pigment. The third set was mixtures of low-Mg calcite and dolomite,
which is typically found in ancient carbonate rocks. The fourth set
was mixtures of aragonite and high- and low-Mg calcite, and the main
combination in modern shallow marine carbonate environments, especially
coral reef regions.13Figure 2 shows the absorbance and reflective
index curves of these four sets of mixtures, and the theoretical curves
calculated by adding the value of the single carbonate mineral (Figure 1) to the mixing ratio.
The measured spectra correspond well with the calculated spectra in
all four cases (coefficient of determination: R2 > 0.98; Figure 2).

Figure 2 Absorbance and reflective index of different mixtures of carbonate
minerals. Theoretical and experimental curves match well. Curves are
shown for the mixture of (a,b) 50% high- and 50% low-Mg calcite; (c,d)
50% aragonite and 50% low-Mg calcite; (e,f) 60% low-Mg calcite and
40% dolomite; and (g,h) 40% aragonite, 30% high-Mg calcite, and 30%
low-Mg calcite.

Since the 1970s, powder
XRD has been the only widely used method
for identifying and quantifying carbonate minerals.13−16 In particular, XRD has been the
only method capable of differentiating high- and low-Mg calcite through
the difference in peak positions (Figure S2).

The Mg content of calcite shifts the peak position at 2θ
of 29.6° of low-Mg calcite to a slightly higher 2θ value
by decreasing the lattice spacing.13,15,16 Our THz-TDS method is as sensitive as or better than
XRD for quantifying low- and high-Mg calcite. Infrared spectroscopic
quantification, in which the linear relationship between the ratio
of the transmittance peaks to the absorption peaks of the mixture
of aragonite–calcite and calcite–dolomite is used, has
been reported; however, the method showed a substantial error for
minor components of less than ∼20% because of the resolution
limit of the spectrometer.6,23 Therefore, our quantification
using THz-TDS is the first high-precision spectroscopic method for
determining the concentration of all major natural carbonate minerals.

2.3 Quantification of Trace Amounts of Low-Mg
Calcite in Aragonite
The sensitivity of our THz-TDS was confirmed
by analyzing mixtures of aragonite and low-Mg calcite (0, 50, 90,
95, 98.5, 99.4, and 100% aragonite). The maximum absorbance (3.32
THz) of 100% low-Mg calcite decreases linearly with increasing aragonite
content (Figure 3a,b).
The difference in reflective index between the maximum at 2.97 THz
and the minimum at 3.60 THz (Figure 3c,d) of 100% low-Mg calcite also decreases linearly
with increasing aragonite content. The absorbance and reflective index
both show excellent linearity with a high correlation coefficient
(R2 > 0.97). Thus, our THz-TDS method
can determine trace concentrations of the mixture, in this case low-Mg
calcite (0.6%).

Figure 3 Absorbance and reflective index of mixtures of different
proportions
of aragonite and low-Mg calcite (0, 50, 90, 95, 98.5, 99.4, and 100%
aragonite). (a) Intensity of absorbance and (c) reflective index decrease
with increasing aragonite content. (b) Maximum absorbance peak (3.32
THz) and (d) the difference between the two extreme reflective index
peaks (2.95 and 3.60 THz) are highly correlated with aragonite concentration
(%).

This experiment is important,
for example, for the screening of
low-Mg calcite diagenetic overprints on primary aragonitic skeletons
such as coral, which is critical because altered aragonite samples
are unsuitable for age dating or climate constructions using chemical
and isotopic analyses (e.g., a 1% alteration to a low-Mg calcite overprint
causes estimated deviations of ∼1 °C).24 XRD analysis has been widely used for screening diagenetic
alterations, and the detection limit for low-Mg calcite is <1%.25,26 Recently, a thermoluminescence (TL) spectroscopy technique that
detects the differences in TL emission efficiency and in the partition
coefficient of manganese between calcite and aragonite was proposed
to achieve a lower or comparable detection limit of secondary calcite
in coral skeletons.24 The TL spectroscopic
technique is potentially useful for analyzing the diagenetic alternation
of aragonite; however, this technique cannot yet identify high-Mg
calcite and dolomite. Our THz-TDS enables quantification of a small
proportion of low-Mg calcite (0.6% or even less), which is far better
than FTIR11 and comparable with XRD25 and TL spectroscopy.24

3 Conclusions
Our ATR method using THz-TDS
in the 1–6 THz range revealed
new mineral-specific absorption peaks and reflective indices at 3.32
THz for calcium carbonate polymorphs of aragonite, high- and low-Mg
calcite, and at 4.82 THz for dolomite. These results allow us to identify
and quantify the main natural Ca–Mg carbonate minerals with
high accuracy. The sensitivity of this method is sufficient to quantify
a small fraction (<1%) of low-Mg calcite in aragonite, comparable
with or lower than the detection limits of XRD and TL spectroscopy.
Our findings may provide a new method for the screening of low-Mg
calcite diagenetic overprints on primary aragonitic skeletons such
as corals, which is crucial for climate reconstructions using isotopic
analyses because a 1% overprint can cause estimated temperature deviations
of ∼1 °C. Further experiments will expand applications
of THz-TDS, for example, quantifying Mg contents in calcium carbonates.
In addition, the technique only requires a class-1 laser, which improves
the safety of the measurements compared with XRD. Many areas, such
as astronomical observations of cosmic dust, testing pharmaceutical
homogeneity, paper making, conservation and restoration of archeological
materials, and THz imaging applications, will benefit from our new
THz fingerprint spectra.

4 Methods
4.1 THz Time-Domain
Spectroscopy
All
materials were ground into powder less than 5 μm in diameter
using a mixer mill (MM 400, Retsch) and homogenized. Measurements
were performed by ATR (Figure S1), which
can obtain the THz spectral signatures from smaller amounts of samples
than the standard transmission technique.11 The sample weight was adjusted to between 1.0 and 1.1 mg, and the
sample was placed in a circular hole 3 mm in diameter in a 1 mm thick
rubber, which was attached to the ATR prism. The powdered sample was
homogenized by adding ethanol (10 μL) and gently stirred with
a polypropylene microspatula. The powder was allowed to dry on the
surface of the ATR prism for 10 min, and then the sample was irradiated
with the THz laser (∼1 mm in diameter). The laser frequency
was scanned from 0.5 to 7.0 THz with a resolution of 55 GHz (0.05
THz), and 10 cumulative measurements were taken (1 min, 30 s). The
THz generator and detector in our THz-TDS are directly attached to
the total reflection prism. Therefore, the system does not require
purging with dry nitrogen to avoid water vapor absorption unlike to
a conventional THz spectrometer.

4.2 XRD
Powder diffraction data were
collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Empyrean, Malvern Panalytical).
Powder samples were packed into zero-background silicon sample holders.
Antiscatter slits, divergence slits, and masks were chosen on the
basis of sample area and starting θ. Data were collected between
2θ of 24 and 32° using data collector software (Panalytical).
Search/Match phase identification was performed using HighScore software
(Panalytical) and ICCD PDF4+ database.

4.3 ICP-AES
Powder samples (0.1–5
mg) were placed in centrifugal tubes and dissolved by adding 2% HNO3 (∼5 mL). The samples were filtered through a 0.2 μm
membrane (Minisart, Sartorius) and diluted with 2% HNO3 if needed. The Ca and Mg concentrations were then measured by an
ICP-AES (iCAP7200, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting data were
used to calculate the elemental content of carbonate minerals.
