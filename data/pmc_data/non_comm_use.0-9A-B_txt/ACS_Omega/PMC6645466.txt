Plants and
other living organisms
have long been used as sources for different useful human products.
Traditional medicines have always been a source for the cure of many
diseases since antiquity. However, their rational use was possible
only after the initial understanding of what were or were not the
“proven biological activities” of the compounds present
in plants and other natural product sources such as microbes and later
marine invertebrates. These molecules are normally known as “secondary
metabolites” meaning that they are not part of the regular
metabolism of the organism that is required to maintain life but that
they have other, usually not known properties. Then the search for
new bioactive compounds (secondary metabolites) was developed, and
as a consequence, a number of new molecules with different spectra
of activities were found.1

This approach
generated wonderful examples that can illustrate
how materials derived from plants and microbes became medicines. Recently,
in 2015, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was divided into
two, with half going to William C. Campbell and Satoshi O̅mura
“for their discoveries concerning a novel therapy against infections
caused by roundworm parasites” and the other half to You-you
Tu “for her discoveries concerning a novel therapy against
Malaria”. Even though half of the prize refers to products
from microorganisms, the molecules are also known as natural products.
The discovery by You-you Tu is a typical example of how the traditional
medicines can be the source of products of plant origin that can be
transformed into drugs. Recently, Pye and co-workers provided insight
for future discovery of bioactive natural products. Quantitative examination
applying a data set of all published microbial and marine-derived
natural products suggests a potential for discovery that is truly
new, but significant innovation will be required to successfully find
novel bioactive compounds.2

Numerous
examples of bioactive natural products are known; however,
their discoveries have always been associated with the development
of new analytical techniques for both isolation and purification and
for structural elucidation. Sometimes the isolation process is tedious
and time consuming, and frequently, the most used approach known as
bioguided isolation leads to the bioactive compound; however, in some
cases, all the efforts result in a known compound or a new series
of compounds with high toxicity. Usually, the natural products as
found in living organisms may not be used directly as a drug, but
their chemical “skeleton” becomes the inspiration for
the development of structurally modified compounds with superior biological
properties. This is often referred to as being “more drug-like”
than the initial compound.

Plants continue to be a rich source
of interesting compounds; however,
in the past decades there has been a change leading to the study other
organisms, and certainly, microbes have caught the attention of scientists.
Just to remember one example, the discovery of penicillin can be cited
as one of the most remarkable findings on the area of natural products.
The study of microorganisms and now their genomes has brought new
insights for the chemistry of natural products, with the capability
to generate chemical diversity by using genome mining, mutasynthesis,
combinatorial biosynthesis, metagenomics, and synthetic biology. Natural
products can be used for many other purposes, such as in agriculture,
in cosmetics, as dyes, as paints, as inks, etc. In addition, they
are involved in ecological processes that include different organisms.

Sometime ago, Schreiber, a renowned chemist from Harvard University,
in his paper “Small molecules: The Missing Link in the Central
Dogma” stated “small molecules have critical roles at
all levels of biological complexities and yet remain orphans of the
central dogma. Chemical biologists, working with small molecules,
expand our understanding of these central elements of life”.3

Even though the search for new drugs from
plants and other organisms
is still exciting and attractive, chemistry has played a key role
in the explanation of biological and biochemical observations, opening
a number of opportunities in the area. Each single organism (plant,
marine or terrestrial animals, microorganism, algae, among others)
interacts with the ecosystem by different strategies, including chemical
signals and/or chemical defenses. In this sense, secondary metabolites
can be understood as words of an ecological and evolutionary language
that governs the synchronization and modulation of metabolic pathways,
organismic and biogeographic.4 Also, the
natural products can have unknown physiological functions that must
be deeply understood in the future.5

Using a simple generalization, we can suggest that natural products
are chemical phenotypes of an organism opening new challenges for
researchers. Once the classical bioassay-guided isolation methods
showed initial analytical limitations such as time-consuming isolations,
a requirement of large sample amounts; new approaches were required
and have gradually converted the focus to fast analysis applying new
technological advancements. These have evolved by combining well-known
spectroscopic and spectrometry strategies, giving support to metadata
analysis. In the last ten years, the capacity to inventory the chemistry
of biological systems, using new analytical tools, particularly the
linkage of various mass spectrometric techniques with computerized
and statistical analyses, has been revolutionary. These were a result
of joint effort between natural products chemists, analytical chemists,
chemical biologists, and computational chemists, looking to understand
the chemistry from the biology viewpoint.5

But what is the next step? The Biology perspective, i.e.,
those
strategies usually defined as “omics protocols”, may
allow a more holistic view of biological chemical interactions from
natural products to large molecules such as DNA and proteins. In the
future, the great amount of data, which will need to be analyzed by
powerful informatics tools, will open the perspective to increase
the number of combined databases and integrating all omic fields (genomic,
transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomics).6 With this macroperspective, we believe that in due course it will
be possible to annotate the biological function for natural products,
and considering what the late Prof. Otto Richard Gottlieb, a renowned
Brazilian natural product chemist, once said, “humanity must
understand the working of nature before using it for any purpose”.

There is no doubt that by using modern approaches natural products
chemists will continue, contributing to the discovery of new medicines,
but there will also be an enormous impact from the metabolomics strategies
designed to identify candidates that may modulate an ecological interaction,
physiological functions, or pharmacological effects. In this way,
there are enormous perspectives for young natural products researchers
to work with omics strategies, looking for a global chemical analysis
of biology. The new natural products scientists must be involved with
the state of the art on computational tools and opening new areas
of research including renewing the fundamental search of new biological
activity molecules.7 The use of metabolic
engineering has opened up a window to the use of synthetic biology,
system biology, and metabolic modeling as tools to facilitate the
access to the construction of known and new pathways in production
of new products of high aggregated value.8 The elucidation of biosynthetic pathways and gene heterologous expression
has become possible to use synthetic biology for the production of
many interesting compounds. These sets of postgenome methods and approaches
have opened up new horizons for young scientists in research of how
natural products can assist human well-being and other ecological
perspectives.
