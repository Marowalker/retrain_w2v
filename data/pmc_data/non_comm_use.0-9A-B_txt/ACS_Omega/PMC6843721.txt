Co-sensitization
is an important strategy toward efficiency enhancement of solar cells
by enabling better light harvesting across the solar spectrum. Betanin
is a natural dye which absorbs light in the major portion of the incident
solar spectrum (green region) and is the most efficient natural pigment
used in dye-sensitized solar cells. This study investigates the performance
enhancement of a betanin solar cell by co-sensitizing it with two
natural pigments which show complementary light absorption, i.e.,
indigo and lawsone, absorbing in the red and blue regions of the solar
spectrum, respectively. The calculated highest occupied molecular
orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of the pigment
molecules, derived from density functional theory (DFT) simulations,
confirmed their optimal alignment with respect to the conduction band
energy of the TiO2 semiconductor and reduction potential
energy level of the I–/I3– electrolyte, a necessary requirement for optimal device performance.
Lawsone solar cells displayed better performance, showing average
efficiencies of 0.311 ± 0.034%, compared to indigo solar cells
showing efficiencies of 0.060 ± 0.004%. Betanin was co-sensitized
with indigo and lawsone, and the performances of the co-sensitized
solar cells were compared. The betanin/lawsone co-sensitized solar
cell showed a higher average efficiency of 0.793 ± 0.021% compared
to 0.655 ± 0.019% obtained for the betanin/indigo co-sensitized
solar cell. An 11.7% enhancement in efficiency (with respect to betanin)
was observed for the betanin/indigo solar cell, whereas a higher enhancement
of 25.5% was observed for the betanin/lawsone solar cell. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy studies confirmed that the higher efficiency
can be attributed to the higher electron lifetime of 313.8 ms in the
betanin/lawsone co-sensitized solar cell compared to 291.4 ms in the
betanin/indigo solar cell. This is due to the energy levels being
more optimally aligned in lawsone compared to that of indigo, as observed
in the DFT studies, and the lack of dipole moment in indigo, resulting
in more efficient charge separation and charge transfer in lawsone.

==== Body
Introduction
Pioneering dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSCs) were realized by O’Regan and Grätzel
in 1991, which have now garnered significant attention owing to their
facile fabrication, making them an attractive alternative to first
and second generation solar cells. A DSSC typically consists of a
photoanode and a counter electrode, sandwiching a redox couple electrolyte
in between. The photoanodes are primarily transparent conductive oxide
[such as indium-doped tin oxide or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)]-coated
glass substrates upon which a wide band gap semiconductor such as
titanium dioxide (TiO2) is coated. The mesoporous titanium
dioxide layer plays the role of a scaffold, enabling the adsorption
of pigment molecules and charge transfer.1,2 Platinum-coated
FTO substrates are widely used as catalytic counter electrodes. In
between the photoanode and the counter electrode is filled a suitable
redox electrolyte that helps in the reduction of the oxidized dye
molecules and in shuttling electrons from the counter electrode.

The photoanode plays the major role of light absorption, generation
of excitons, and charge transfer, and hence the photosensitizer is
a particularly important component of the DSSC.3,4 Ruthenium-
and osmium-based polypyridyl complex dyes have so far resulted in
the best efficiencies of ∼11% and stability.1,5 These
photosensitizers possess the general structure ML2(X)2, where M, L, and X represent Ru or Os, 2,2′bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylic
acid, and halide/cyanide/thiocyanate/acetylacetonate/thiocarbamate/water
groups, respectively. The N3 dye, i.e., cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato
ruthenium(II), is the pioneering dye used in DSSCs since 1993, whose
performance remained unmatched for several years.6 Ruthenium complex-based dyes, though high-performing, are
extremely expensive because of the rarity of the ruthenium metal and
the complex preparatory processes. Moreover, they are highly toxic,
and therefore, in the long run, their disposal would pose a serious
problem.

In contrast, natural dyes are nontoxic, environment-friendly,
and easily extracted from various plant parts such as leaves, fruits,
flowers, and roots. Therefore, they are an excellent alternative for
application as photosensitizers in DSSCs.7,8 Numerous
natural dyes such as chlorophylls,9,10 carotenoids,11 flavonoids such as anthocyanins12,13 and betalains,7,14−16 and tannins17−19 have been studied as photosensitizers in DSSCs. However, poor efficiencies
and limited life span are the primary issues faced by solar cells
prepared using natural pigments. Till date, mean photoelectric conversion
efficiencies of ∼0.4% have been demonstrated by these natural
DSSCs.7,9−15,18,20 The underwhelming performance of natural dye solar cells is primarily
because of the narrow absorption bands and low absorption coefficients
of the dyes compared to the conventionally used synthetic dyes.21

Previous studies indicate that betanin
is a comparatively more efficient plant pigment and has demonstrated
the best efficiencies (1.5–2%) among natural dye-based solar
cells.15,22 Betanin is an interesting plant pigment
absorbing in the 476–600 nm range, thereby harnessing solar
radiation in the green portion of the visible spectrum, where most
of the incident solar radiation falls. The broad-band absorption of
betanin in covering the green region of the visible spectrum, combined
with the presence of strong anchoring groups, could be the reason
for its relatively higher solar cell efficiencies compared to other
natural pigments.

Augmenting the efficiencies achieved by betanin
solar cells would render these “green” solar cells an
appealing technology, suitable for application in disposable portable
electronics.

Efficiency enhancement by widening the absorption
band23,24 using multiple materials is a strategy that
has been explored long since the inception of multijunction solar
cells.25 Combining betanin along with pigments
absorbing in the complementary regions of the solar spectrum is a
promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency of betanin solar cells.
Our previous study involving the co-sensitization of betanin with
chlorophyll26 indicated that betanin solar
cells showed a relatively better performance, giving average efficiencies
of 0.538 ± 0.021%; however, chlorophyll was observed to be an
inefficient photosensitizer and did not contribute much to the overall
efficiency. In this study, alternate natural pigments, which absorb
light in regions complementary to betanin, have been explored (following
methods similar to those described in our previous publication26) to study efficiency enhancement via co-sensitization.
In this study, we compare the performance enhancement of betanin (λmax = 535 nm,27 the green region)
through co-sensitization with (i) indigo (λmax =
625 nm,28 the red region) and (ii) lawsone
(λmax = 410 nm,17 the
blue region). Indigo and lawsone are natural pigments and were extracted
from the plant sources—Indigofera tinctoria and Lawsonia inermis, and used in
this study. The aim of this study is to explore plant pigments that
complement the absorption spectrum of betanin for performance enhancement
in DSSCs. Lawsone would complement betanin by extending the light
harvesting to the blue region, and indigo would complement betanin
by extending the light-harvesting to the red region. Several factors
involved in the fabrication of natural dye solar cells have been optimized
in this work.

So as to make certain that the performance of
solar cells was optimal, the band gap and the appropriate alignment
of the pigments were confirmed using DFT (density functional theory)
simulations29 using Gaussian0930 software. Although DFT studies of the betanin
molecule have previously been explored,26 the DFT studies of indigo and lawsone are limited in the literature.
The computational studies helped in predicting the positions of the
HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital) levels and thereby the band gap of the molecules.
Moreover, it helped in understanding the intramolecular electron density
shift, caused by photoexcitation in the donor–linker–acceptor
groups. The dipole moments and charge distribution of the pigments
were also determined from the simulations, which helped in predicting
how well the pigment would interact and bind with TiO2.
The DFT simulations of the pigment molecules helped gain better insights
into their electronic features and predict their feasibility of application
in DSSCs. The feasibility of application of these dyes predicted by
the DFT simulations was confirmed to be accurate by the performance
of the solar cells, proving this method to be an invaluable tool in
selecting the right dyes from the vast array of pigments available
in nature.

In this paper, we report the comparison of performance
enhancement by the co-sensitization of betanin with indigo and with
lawsone, the natural pigments derived from plant sources—I. tinctoria and L. inermis. Individual and co-sensitized configurations were fabricated and
their performances were assessed. As expected, the co-sensitized solar
cell configurations demonstrated better efficiencies than the individually
sensitized configurations because of the broader absorption of incident
light resulting in a higher current density. On comparing the co-sensitized
configurations, the betanin/lawsone co-sensitized solar cell had a
higher average efficiency of 0.793 ± 0.021%, whereas an average
efficiency of 0.655 ± 0.019% was demonstrated by the betanin/indigo
co-sensitized solar cell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
of the solar cells was carried out to understand the internal resistances
and electron lifetimes of the solar cells31 and correlate them with their performance characteristics. The dye
degradation of indigo and lawsone because of the photocatalytic activity
(PCA) of TiO2 and its effect on the solar cell lifetimes
has also been investigated.

Results and Discussion
Structures of the Two Natural
Dye Co-Sensitized Solar Cells
The diagrammatic representations
of both the natural dye co-sensitized solar cell configurations, betanin/indigo
and betanin/lawsone solar cells, are shown in Figure 1. A TiO2 mesoporous film is coated
onto the FTO conductive glass substrate. The two configurations of
solar cells consist of the TiO2 film co-sensitized using
the betanin pigment with complementary dyes: (a) with indigo in one
configuration and (b) with lawsone in the other configuration. The
FTO glass substrate coated with the TiO2 film and sensitized
by the dye functions as the photoanode. Pt-coated FTO electrodes have
been employed as the counter electrodes. Between both the electrodes
is the iodide/triiodide redox mediator.

showing the complementary absorption by the co-sensitized pigments

pictures of the pigment sources shown as insets are from the public
domain).

Betanin consists of the betaine
moiety, i.e., an indole-2-carboxylic acid, N-linked through an acetyl
group to the betalamic acid group, i.e., a pyridine dicarboxylic acid
group. The electron transitions occurring in the conjugated systems
cause light absorption by betanin in the green region of the visible-light
spectrum. The molecule possesses many carboxylic acid groups, which
enable strong anchoring onto TiO2 with good dipole interactions.
The mechanism of binding of betanin with TiO2 is through
bidentate chelation32 via the carboxyl
groups. Indican is a colorless, naturally occurring water-soluble
derivative of tryptophan (amino acid), found in I.
tinctoria plants. It is the precursor of the dye,
indigo. On hydrolysis of indican, β-d-glucose and indoxyl
are released. Oxidation of indoxyl, on exposure to air, converts it
to indigo. Indican was extracted from I. tinctoria leaves by fermentation, which converts the glycoside indican (0.2–0.8%
of this compound is present in I. tinctoria leaves) to the compound indigotin, responsible for the blue color
of the indigo dye. Lawsone, also known as hennotannic acid, is chemically
2-hydroxy-1, 4-naphthoquinone. The lawsone molecule consists of two
oxygen atoms, which are attached to the naphthalene carbons at positions
1 and 4 forming 1,4-naphthoquinone, and a hydroxyl (−OH) group
attached at position 2. Lawsone was extracted from L. inermis (henna) leaves.

The extracted dyes
were purified and used as such. No chemical modifications were performed
on the dyes. For the best solar cell performances, the combination
of pigments used in the solar cells should absorb at wavelengths that
coincide well with the incident solar spectrum in the 300–1000
nm range.33 This was confirmed using UV–vis
absorption spectroscopic studies, elucidated in the following section.

Absorption Studies of the Dyes
UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy of the pigments was performed at wavelengths between
300 and 800 nm. Indigo and lawsone were extracted from I. tinctoria and L. inermis leaves using deionized water and acetone, respectively. The individual
absorption spectra of betanin, indigo, and lawsone are shown in Figure 2a. The peak absorbance
for indigo and lawsone was obtained at 625 and 410 nm, respectively
(Figure 2a), and matched
with the values found in the literature.17,28 In the absorption spectrum of lawsone, the first absorption maximum
at 338 nm is observed because of the HOMO → LUMO transitions
which take place in the C=C (π → π*) and
C=O (n → π*) regions of the quinoidal ring of
lawsone, and the absorption peak seen in the visible region at 410
nm arises from the n → π* transitions localized mainly
around the oxygen atom of the quinoidal ring. In the absorption spectrum
of indigo, the absorption maximum at 625 nm is observed because of
the n → π* transitions which occur between the electron
donor NH and the electron acceptor C=O groups. As determined
in our earlier studies, betanin has its absorption maximum at 535
nm.26

Figure 2 Absorption spectra of (a) liquid extracts
of betanin, indigo, and lawsone, (b) photoanode co-sensitized with
a mixture of betanin and indigo, and (c) photoanode co-sensitized
with a mixture of betanin and lawsone. The chemical structures of
betanin, indigo, and lawsone are shown as insets.

To effectively complement the absorption spectrum of betanin, indigo
and lawsone were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with betanin, and the absorption
spectra of the betanin/indigo and betanin/lawsone mixtures were characterized.
As expected, broad absorption bands were observed in both cases (seen
in Figure 2b,c), and
the combined absorption spectrum is a broad band covering a significant
portion of the incident solar radiation (in 300–1000 nm range).33 When incident light falls on the pigments, they
generate photocarriers. For an effective transfer of the photoexcited
electrons, it is essential to confirm the optimal alignment of the
LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the dye molecules with the conduction
band of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte,
respectively.

DFT Simulations of the Dyes
To ensure
effective charge transfer, it is necessary to have sufficient overlapping
of the LUMO of the pigment molecules with the conduction band of titanium
dioxide.32 DFT simulations were performed
using Gaussian09 software to verify the alignment of the HOMO and
LUMO energy levels of the pigment molecules and to determine their
band gaps.

The simulations were done using the Becke-3-Lee–Yang–Parr
(B3LYP) hybrid functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set, as these offer
good accuracy for a wide range of organic molecules. By performing
energy optimization, the pigment molecules were optimized into energy-favorable
conformations. The convergence criterion for energy optimization was
set as 10–6 Hartree. The probability distribution
of electron density at the molecular orbitals, the energy levels of
molecular orbitals (with respect to vacuum), the charge distribution,
and the dipole moment of the pigment molecules were obtained from
the DFT simulations. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined
and used to calculate the band gap of indigo and lawsone.

The
band gap of indigo was deduced to be 1.8 eV from the HOMO and LUMO
levels obtained from the simulations, closely corresponding to 1.9
eV, which was experimentally determined from the absorption maximum
of indigo at 625 nm (also reported in the literature34). The analysis of the molecular orbitals showed that the
probability distribution of electron density at the HOMO and LUMO
levels is predominantly around the NH and C=O groups in the
molecule. The two nonbonding electrons on the N atom participating
in the delocalization of the π-electrons of the conjugated systems
correspond to the HOMO energy level (Figure 3a) and the antibonding π* orbitals
form the LUMO level of indigo (Figure 3b). The photoexcitation of the nonbonding electrons from the electron
donor NH group to the antibonding π* orbital in the electron
acceptor C=O group form the n → π* transitions.
The C=O group helps the pigment anchor with TiO2. The electron density map shown in Figure 3c depicts the distribution of charge on the
indigo molecule (green and red colors represent electropositivity
and electronegativity, respectively). As the molecule is symmetric,
the net dipole moment is negligible and is equal to 0.0053 D.

distributions of lawsone. (g) Alignment of the energy levels (with
respect to vacuum) of the materials with respect to each other.

The band gap of lawsone was deduced to be 2.7 eV
from the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which is close to 2.9 eV, experimentally
determined from the absorption peak of lawsone at 410 nm.17 The probability distribution of the electron
density corresponding to the HOMO and LUMO levels is located around
the benzoid and the quinoid moieties, respectively (Figure 3d,e). The first absorption
peak at 338 nm mainly involves HOMO → LUMO transitions within
the C=C (π → π*) and C=O (n →
π*) regions of the quinoidal ring of lawsone. The absorption
peak seen in the visible region at 410 nm arises from the n →
π* transitions localized mainly around the oxygen atom of the
quinoidal ring. Figure 3f shows the distribution of charge on the lawsone molecule. The carbonyl
carbons of C=O groups can be observed to be highly electropositive,
indicating the strong electron-withdrawing nature. The C=O
group anchors the lawsone molecule onto TiO2. The lawsone
molecule shows a net dipole moment equal to 5.78 D.

DFT studies
of betanin molecule have already been performed in our previous work.26 The HOMO and LUMO levels and the dipole moment
obtained from this study have been listed in Table 1 and are used to plot the relative energy
levels in Figure 3g.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of betanin, indigo, and lawsone determined
from the DFT calculations match the energy levels that have been previously
determined experimentally using the cyclic voltammetry technique by
various research groups,35,36 thus validating these
results.

Table 1 HOMO Energies (EHOMO), LUMO Energies (ELUMO), and the Dipole
Moment of the Natural Pigments
dye molecule	EHOMO (eV)	ELUMO (eV)	dipole moment (μ)
(Debye)	
indigo	–5.7	–3.9	0.0053	
lawsone	–5.3	–2.6	5.7816	
betanin26	–5.2	–3.1	8.6895	
The difference between the oxidation and reduction
potentials with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) reference
is the band gap of the material. On the basis of this, the energy
levels of various dyes used in this study can be determined with respect
to vacuum37 and to predict their alignment
with respect to one another. The HOMO–LUMO energy levels and
the dipole moments of indigo and lawsone molecules obtained from the
simulations are listed in Table 1.

For optimal working of the device, the LUMO
energy level of the pigment molecules should be positioned above the
conduction band of TiO2, and their HOMO energy levels should
be positioned below the redox potential of the electrolyte. The band
diagram shows an appropriate alignment of the energy levels of lawsone
and indigo with respect to those of TiO2 and the electrolyte.
However, in the case of indigo, the alignment is not very optimal
as the HOMO level is far beneath the redox potential of the electrolyte
and the LUMO is too close to the conduction band of TiO2. Moreover, indigo seems to have an almost negligible dipole moment,
indicating that its interaction with TiO2 may be weak and
the charge transfer may not be effective. This could hamper the solar
cell performance.

Optimization of the Sensitization of the
Dyes
The time of sensitization and number of dye coatings
for the solar cell configurations fabricated with betanin, indigo,
and lawsone individually were optimized. After this, the sequence
of sensitization was optimized in the co-sensitized solar cell configurations.
The distribution of cell performance over multiple samples of each
configuration is depicted using the box plots (Figure 4a–c).

Figure 4 Optimization of the sensitization of betanin,
indigo, and lawsone pigments: (a) time of sensitization, (b) number
of coatings, and the (c) sequence of the sensitization of the pigments
in the co-sensitized configuration with betanin [image source: pictures
of the photoelectrodes shown as inset in (b) were photographed by
the first author].

Betanin, indigo, and
lawsone solar cells were fabricated and tested for a time of sensitization
of 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. The time 24 h was found to be an optimum
time for sensitization in the case of betanin and lawsone solar cells,
and 36 h was observed to be optimum in the case of indigo solar cells.
The optimum time of sensitization for the best performance of a particular
dye is dependent on the rate of dye anchoring up to an optimum concentration.
Lawsone and betanin have higher dipole moments favoring the dipole–dipole
interaction with TiO2; moreover, they possess more favorable
functional groups (−COOH and −OH) compared to indigo
(with =CO groups) which will enable a higher rate of anchoring.
The dipole moments were calculated using the DFT studies and have
been listed in Table 1. Studies by Rajab et al. show that the energy conversion efficiency
increased with the dye adsorption time.38 Chang et al. demonstrated that with the increasing dye adsorption
time, the chemisorbed dye layer increases; however, beyond an optimum
concentration, the increase of the dye layer obstructs the charge
transfer from the conduction band of the TiO2 surface to
the FTO electrolyte.39 In the case of betanin
and lawsone, the binding rates are faster because of the aforementioned
reasons; thereby, the optimum concentration of the dye layer at which
the dye performs best in the DSSC is achieved faster compared to that
of indigo. Three samples of each configuration were tested, and the
distribution of the solar cell efficiencies is shown in Figure 4a.

With respect to the
number of coatings, in case of all the three solar cell configurations
(betanin, indigo, and lawsone), more than one coating proved detrimental
to the solar cell performance, possibly because of dye aggregation.
The physical aggregation of the dye inhibits the chemical adsorption
of the dye with TiO2, reducing the effective charge transfer.
Three samples of each configuration were tested, and the distribution
of the solar cell efficiencies is shown in Figure 4b.

To determine the optimum sequence
of sensitization for the co-sensitized solar cell configurations,
the following configurations were fabricated: (i) betanin followed
by indigo/lawsone, (ii) indigo/lawsone followed by betanin, and (iii)
a mixture of betanin and indigo/lawsone. Five samples of each configuration
were tested, and the distribution of the solar cell efficiencies is
shown in Figure 4c.
It was observed that the premixed solution resulted in slightly higher
efficiencies in the case of the betanin/lawsone configuration, whereas
sensitizing betanin followed by indigo showed a better performance
in the case of the betanin/indigo configuration, as observed from Figure 4c. The optimized
solar cell configurations were used for further testing and characterization.

Triple-dye co-sensitized solar cells using all the three dyes were
also tested in various orders of sensitization as well as using a
mixture. However, the efficiencies of these triple-dye co-sensitized
solar cells were lower than that of the betanin solar cell, and hence
this was not pursued further. The plausible reasons for the detrimental
effect on combining all three dyes could be: (i) too much competition
among the dyes for the binding sites with TiO2; this can
be inferred by the fact that the efficiency of the mixed solar cell
was found to be lower than that of the betanin solar cell; (ii) the
presence of additional trap levels where the photoexcited electron
can recombine without injection into TiO2, which could
cause the rate of back-reactions and recombination to be higher than
the favorable kinetics. Hence, these three dyes are not ideal for
triple sensitization, though the reason for this is presently unclear.
However, there might exist other combinations of dyes that can be
explored, which will result in a combined efficiency that is higher
than their individual efficiencies.

Photoelectric Conversion
Efficiency of the Solar Cells
After optimization, solar cells
of five configurations were fabricated: indigo solar cell, lawsone
solar cell, betanin solar cell, betanin/indigo co-sensitized solar
cell, and betanin/lawsone co-sensitized solar cell. The performance
characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a solar simulator
under 1 sun illumination. The efficiencies of the solar cells were
measured by defining a photoactive area of 0.25 cm2 using
a black mask. Five samples were tested for each configuration. The
following performance parameters were obtained from the J–V characteristic curves of the solar cells:
open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit
current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF),
voltage (Vmax) and current density (Jmax) corresponding to the maximum power extraction,
and the photoelectric conversion efficiency (η)and are listed
in Table 2.

Cells Studied

The J–V and P–V characteristics of the five samples fabricated in each
configuration are shown in Figure 5a,b. A box plot showing the distribution of the efficiencies
achieved for the various configurations is shown in Figure 5c. Lawsone solar cells showed
better performance, giving average efficiencies of 0.311 ± 0.034%
compared to indigo solar cells showing 0.060 ± 0.004%. The lawsone
solar cells show higher current density compared to the indigo solar
cells.

betanin/lawsone (Bet/Law): (a) I–V characteristics, (b) P–V characteristics, and (c) box plot showing the distribution of efficiencies
of five samples of each configuration, mean, and deviation.

Betanin was co-sensitized with indigo and lawsone,
and the performances of the co-sensitized solar cells were assessed.
As expected, the co-sensitized solar cell configurations displayed
better performances than the individually sensitized solar cells attributed
to their light harvesting over a broader wavelength range, causing
an increased current density. Among the two co-sensitized configurations,
the betanin/lawsone co-sensitized solar cell gave the best average
efficiency of 0.793 ± 0.021% compared to 0.655 ± 0.019%
obtained for the betanin/indigo co-sensitized solar cell. An efficiency
enhancement (with respect to betanin) of 11.7% was observed for the
betanin/indigo solar cell, whereas an enhancement of 25.5% was observed
for the betanin/lawsone solar cell.

Study of Electron Lifetime
in the Solar Cells
The better performance by lawsone solar
cells compared to indigo solar cells and hence the better enhancement
observed in betanin/lawsone solar cells can be understood by EIS.
EIS is a tool which helps in the better understanding of the electron
transfer and recombination processes occurring within DSSCs and can
be used to determine the electron lifetimes and correlating the physical
processes with the performance of the device.

The Nyquist plots
of the solar cell configurations were measured at a frequency range
of 100 kHz to 10 mHz, keeping constant a dc voltage bias of 0.5 V
(∼Voc of the DSSC). Typical Nyquist
plots of DSSCs consist of two semicircles, wherein the semicircle
with the larger real part describes the electron recombination in
the TiO2 film and that with the smaller real part describes
the transfer of electrons at the Pt–FTO electrode/electrolyte
interface and from the TiO2 layer to FTO. The physical
parameters of DSSCs were extracted by fitting the EIS spectra into
a suitable equivalent circuit model that mimics the charge transfer
and recombination processes in the device.

The equivalent circuit
model depicted in Figure 6a describes the typical internal resistances and capacitances
present in a DSSC40 and was used for the
fitting of the measured Nyquist plots.

Figure 6 (a) Equivalent circuit
model used for the fitting of Nyquist plots. (b) Nyquist plots generated
from the equivalent circuit model fit with the measured data for the
five solar cell configurations: betanin (Bet), indigo (Ind), lawsone
(Law), betanin/indigo (Bet/Ind), and betanin/lawsone (Bet/Law).

The impedance Z(f) of the model is described by the below equation40 1  where Rs describes the series resistance
in FTO and the loss because of transport in the electrolyte layer, RPt describes the resistance to the electron
transfer at the Pt electrode/electrolyte interface, RTiO2 describes the recombination resistance
at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, QPt describes the capacitance at the Pt electrode/electrolyte
interface, and QTiO2 describes
the chemical capacitance of the double layer formed at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.41Q represents the constant phase element (CPE) which is used
for describing imperfect capacitive processes. Pure capacitance with
the CPE index α equaling 1 occurs very rarely in DSSCs, where
often α is lesser than 1. In such devices, the capacitive processes
are depicted by CPE elements, so that data fitting is accurate.40

The fitting was done using the Z-Fit function
of E-C Lab software by choosing the model shown in Figure 6a, and the χ2 value was minimized to establish the goodness-of-fit of the model.
χ2 (Chi square) values having orders <10–4 and error < 1% are regarded as a good fit. The Nyquist plots
of the five configurations are shown in Figure 6b. The extracted EIS parameters and the calculated
electron lifetimes of the five solar cell configurations are listed
in Table 3.

The
photoanode is of primary interest in this study. EIS helps in relating
the internal resistances and electron lifetimes with the performance
of DSSCs. For optimum working, a DSSC should possess a high resistance
to electron recombination processes. It is known that the electron
lifetime (τ) in the photoanode is a function of charge-transfer
resistance at the photoanode–electrolyte interface. Greater
values of charge-transfer resistance and capacitance predict that
the electron lifetime would be longer and that the occurrence of unwanted
electron recombination processes at the electrode–electrolyte
interface would have lesser odds.42 The
efficiency of the solar cell is negatively affected by the recombination
of electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 with the
redox electrolyte. Therefore, longer electron lifetimes are favorable. Table 3 lists the EIS parameters
and the electron lifetimes of the five solar cell configurations,
calculated using eq 2.43 2  

A higher
electron lifetime is observed in lawsone solar cells (34.61 ms) compared
to indigo solar cells (29.44 ms). This is possibly because of the
better optimal alignment of energy levels in lawsone compared to indigo
as observed in the DFT studies and the lack of dipole moment in indigo,
resulting in more efficient charge separation and charge transfer
in lawsone. The lower value of RTiO2 and QTiO2 in indigo
solar cells (27.33 Ω, 0.003 F sα–1)
compared to that in lawsone solar cells (28.48 Ω, 0.004 F sα–1) and in betanin solar cells (32.69 Ω,
0.004 F sα–1) shows that the probability of
recombination at the TiO2/dye electrolyte interface is
higher in indigo solar cells. Therefore, the electron lifetime in
indigo solar cells is lower (at 29.44 ms) compared to that in lawsone
solar cells and betanin solar cells. As a result, the better performance
in the betanin/lawsone co-sensitized solar cell can be attributed
to the greater electron lifetime (313.8 ms) in it, compared to that
(291.4 ms) attained in the betanin/indigo solar cell. The photocurrent
generation by the different photoanodes and the photo-induced charge
transfer can be analyzed further by measuring the incident photon
conversion efficiency and performing ultrafast transient absorption
pump–probe spectroscopy.

Dye Degradation and Solar
Cell Lifetime Studies
The following study examines the degradation
of the dye-sensitized onto TiO2 as a result of its inherent
photocatalytic nature and the subsequent effect this imposes on the
lifetime of the solar cell. PCA of TiO2 occurs when high-energy UV radiation from
the solar spectrum is absorbed by TiO2, exciting electrons
from its valence band to the conduction band. The resulting photoexcited
electrons are of high energy, and upon their interaction with moisture,
they result in the generation of reactive OH radicals. These reactive
species result in the PCA of TiO2 causing disintegration
of organic matter which is in close proximity.44,45 Heat-based sealing techniques normally employed in conventional
DSSCs cannot be used in natural dye solar cells, which means that
oxygen and moisture can infiltrate the solar cells through minute
gaps which may be present at the unsealed edges between the sandwiched
electrodes, making the pigments vulnerable to photocatalytic degradation.

The degradation of the pigments lawsone and indigo as a result
of the PCA of TiO2 was observed using UV–vis spectroscopic
studies. TiO2-coated substrates were placed fully immersed
in lawsone and indigo pigment solutions of 5 mg L–1 as the initial concentration. The samples were exposed to a light
intensity of 1 sun (using a solar simulator) for 5 h.

The effect
of PCA of TiO2 on the dyes was studied by measuring their
absorption spectra at intervals of 1 h.

Lawsone and indigo are
colored compounds absorbing visible light, having conjugated double
bonds which means that low-energy electronic transitions occur in
these molecules. As these molecules break down with photodegradation,
the degree of delocalization decreases causing an increase in the
required energy to result in electron transitions.46 Hence, this results in a blue shift of λmax of both indigo and lawsone. The intensity of absorbance also decreases
with time, indicating the degradation of the dye molecules occurring
with time as a result of PCA of TiO2. This can be seen
in Figure 7a,b.

Figure 7 PCA of TiO2 resulting in a decrease in the intensity of absorbance by
(a) indigo and (b) lawsone; (c) photocatalytic degradation of the
dyes following first-order kinetics; and the (d) percentage decrease
in the concentration of the dyes with time.

Pigment degradation follows the first-order kinetics47 described using the following equation47 3  where t is the irradiation time, C0 represents the initial concentration, Ct represents the concentration of the
dye at a time “t”, and k is the rate constant.

Figure 7c shows the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of
indigo and lawsone. The adjusted R2 value
of the linear fit of the plot was determined as 0.9686, and the “k” values of indigo and lawsone were found to be
0.0027 and 0.0017, respectively. The study showed that, over a period
of 5 h, 90% of degradation is observed in indigo, whereas 70% of degradation
is observed in the case of lawsone. The photocatalytic degradation
of betanin has been studied in our previous publication,26 which showed betanin reaches 90% degradation
mark in 4 h. It can be inferred that the rate of degradation of lawsone
is slower than that of indigo (and also betanin). This could be because
of the fact that lawsone is capable of strongly absorbing in the UV
region at 335 nm (which results in high energy π → π*
transitions)17 without breaking down its
molecular structure and properties. Although the mechanism of the
relative stability of lawsone to PCA of TiO2 is unclear
as yet, the substance has been used as an effective sunscreen since
ancient times because of this property.48Figure 7d shows the
percentage decrease in the concentration of the pigments with respect
to time, which was calculated as follows 4  where ρ is
the decrease in the concentration of the pigments with respect to
time, t is the irradiation time, C0 represents the initial concentration, and Ct represents the concentration of the
dye at a time “t”.

The five solar
cell configurations were fabricated and kept under constant illumination
of 1 sun, under the solar simulator for 5 h. At 30 min intervals,
the efficiencies of the solar cells were recorded. It was observed
that the solar cell efficiencies reduce with time (as seen in Figure 8a,b). The reason
for this efficiency decrease may be attributed to either the interaction
with TiO2 or with the electrolyte. However, it appears
that the effect of PCA of TiO2 is a major factor contributing
to this negative effect, as observed in the study described in the
previous section. The efficiency decrease observed in lawsone solar
cells of 51% (in 5 h, 0.321% decreased to 0.159%) is noted to be slightly
lower compared to the 53% efficiency decrease observed in the indigo
solar cells (in 5 h, 0.0629% decreased to 0.0298%). On studying the
lifetimes of the two co-sensitized solar cell configurations, it was
observed that the betanin/lawsone co-sensitized solar cell demonstrates
a slightly higher lifetime, with only a 40.8% efficiency decrease
(in 5 h, 0.798% decreased to 0.473%), whereas a 46.3% efficiency decrease
(in 5 h, 0.66% decreased to 0.355%) was observed in the betanin/indigo
co-sensitized solar cell. The study shows that betanin/lawsone co-sensitized
solar cells offer a comparatively higher combined efficiency and lifetime.

Figure 8 Change

to a constant illumination of 1 sun for 5 h: (a) absolute decrease
in efficiency and (b) normalized decrease in efficiency.

The components apart from the dyes used at present in the
NDSSCs are optimized for synthetic dyes and do not take into consideration
the negative effect they may have on natural dyes. Optimization or
replacement of these components (such as the photocatalytic TiO2 and the electrolyte) to render them more compatible with
natural dyes to improve their stability is the way forward for further
efficiency enhancement of the natural DSSCs. The stability and lifetimes
of the NDSSCs require improvement. It may be possible to inhibit the
photocatalytic degradation of natural photosensitizers by using suitable
stabilizers and robust encapsulation techniques.

Conclusions
A comparison of co-sensitization of two combinations of natural
photosensitizers has been reported in this work. Betanin, a natural
dye absorbing in the major portion of the incident solar spectrum—the
green region, is the most efficient natural pigment for DSSCs. To
broaden the absorption band, betanin was co-sensitized with two pigments
which absorb light in regions complementary to betanin/indigo and
lawsone, the natural pigments derived from plant sources—I. tinctoria and L. inermis, with the absorption bands in the red and blue portions of the solar
spectrum, respectively. The absorption studies of the extracted and
purified pigments showed the characteristic absorption peaks of lawsone
and indigo at 410 nm (blue) and 625 nm (red), respectively. The theoretically
calculated HOMO and LUMO energies of the pigment molecules, obtained
from DFT simulations, showed their optimal alignment with respect
to the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor and the
reduction potential energy of the I–/I3– electrolyte, required for the optimal working
of the device. The fabrication of the devices was optimized, and the
performance characteristics of the various solar cell configurations
have been elucidated. Lawsone solar cells gave a better performance,
giving average efficiencies of 0.311 ± 0.034% compared to indigo
solar cells showing 0.060 ± 0.004%. This is also corroborated
by the EIS studies, which showed higher electron lifetime in lawsone
solar cells (34.61 ms) compared to that in indigo solar cells (29.44
ms). This may be attributed to the more optimal alignment of energy
levels of lawsone molecules compared to that of the indigo molecules,
as observed in the DFT studies. Moreover, the lack of dipole moment
in indigo, compared to the strong dipole moment present in lawsone,
resulted in more efficient charge separation and charge transfer in
lawsone. The lawsone solar cells show higher current density compared
to the indigo solar cells. Betanin was co-sensitized with indigo and
lawsone, and the performances of the co-sensitized solar cells were
assessed. The betanin/lawsone co-sensitized solar cell demonstrated
a higher average efficiency of 0.793 ± 0.021% compared to 0.655
± 0.019% obtained for the betanin/indigo co-sensitized solar
cell. An 11.7% enhancement of efficiency (with respect to betanin)
was observed for the betanin/indigo solar cell, whereas a higher enhancement
of 25.5% was observed for the betanin/lawsone solar cell. It could
be concluded from the EIS studies that the better performance of the
betanin/lawsone solar cell is a result of the longer electron lifetime
in it (313.8 ms) compared to that in the betanin/indigo solar cell
(291.4 ms).

The future scope of this study will include fabrication
of tandem devices and comparison of their performances with that of
the existing configuration for solar cells using multiple natural
dyes. The results from the various studies are encouraging enough
to continue exploring avenues of increasing the efficiency and lifetime
of natural pigment solar cells to be able to harness their potential
for practical applications in the future.

software was used to perform energy optimization of the pigment molecules
by employing the DFT hybrid functional B3LYP and the 6-31G(d,p) basis
set.30 The studies helped in determining
the probability distribution of electron densities corresponding to
HOMO and LUMO of the dye molecules and their energy levels with respect
to vacuum. On the basis of the difference between the HOMO and LUMO
energy levels, the band gap of the pigment molecules was determined.
The charge distribution and the dipole moments of indigo and lawsone
molecules were determined from the simulations that helped predict
how the dye molecules would interact with TiO2 and perform
in the solar cell.

Preparation of the Solar Cell
The
photoanodes were prepared using FTO substrates (dimensions = 15 mm
× 15 mm × 1.1 mm, ρ < 10 Ω cm–1, and % T > 83%, purchased from Solaronix) and
used for the experiments. For the photoanode preparation, successive
ultrasonication of the FTO substrates was carried out for 15 min each
in deionized water, detergent solution, and ethanol.49 The TiO2 paste was prepared following the optimized
methods available in the literature.50 To
fabricate the photoanode, the prepared TiO2 suspension
was doctor-bladed onto the conducting face of the FTO plate and then
calcined for 1 h at 450 °C to remove the organics present.49 All preparatory works were carried out at room
temperature in ambient conditions.

Following this, the prepared
photoanodes were subjected to TiCl4 treatment according
to the optimized protocols available in the literature.15,50 The TiCl4 treatment is an essential step in the preparation
of the photoanode that ensures higher performance. As a result of
this step, TiO2 nanoparticles are formed caused by the
hydrolyzation of the TiCl4 solution. When the photoanodes
are annealed, these nanoparticles crystallize and create better contact
interface within the mesoporous TiO2 film that facilitates
better electron transfer across the film. This helps in reducing defect
sites, thereby reducing the recombination rate of electrons, and hence
enhancing their collection.51,52 In addition, the TiCl4 treatment helps in providing more sites for the binding of
the photosensitizer with TiO2.15,50 The TiO2 coating was performed by optimized methods,50 and the thickness was verified to be at an average
optimum thickness of 22 μm measured using the Z-stack option
in the Carl Zeiss SteREO Discovery V20 optical microscope. A thickness
range of 20–25 μm for the TiO2 coating has
been previously determined as optimal for the best performance of
DSSCs, through rigorous optimization, by Ito et al., 2007.50

The betanin, indigo, and lawsone pigments
used in the experiments were extracted and purified following the
optimized methods.53−55 The photoanodes were left to stand immersed in the
extracted pigments for 24 h in the case of betanin and lawsone and
for 36 h in the case of indigo. The sensitization process has been
carefully optimized by varying the number of dye coatings, the time
of sensitization, and the order of sensitization while quantifying
the solar cell performance as described in the section Optimization of the Sensitization of Dyes. Following
this step, they were gently rinsed using ethanol to remove moisture
and debris and then dried. The color of each pigment adsorbed onto
TiO2 could be observed visually. Pt-coated FTO substrates
(Solaronix) were employed as the counter electrodes. The electrolyte
used in the experiments was gel-type and prepared by dissolving LiI/I2 (1.0 M/0.1 M), the iodine redox mediator, in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone mixed with 6% (w/w) polyvinylidene fluoride
which works as a binder.56 The solar cell
was fabricated by fixing the photoanode over the counter electrode
and injecting the prepared gel electrolyte into the space between
the electrodes set by a spacer.

Five different solar cell configurations
were prepared: indigo solar cell, lawsone solar cell, betanin solar
cell, betanin/indigo solar cell, and betanin/lawsone solar cell. A
black mask was employed to define an active area of 0.25 cm2 for all the experiments, and the reverse face of the Pt-FTO electrode
was covered with a copper sheet to arrest transmission losses.

Characterization
and Measurements
The absorption characteristics of indigo,
lawsone, betanin/indigo, and betanin/lawsone mixtures were measured
in the wavelengths between 300 and 800 nm using a Shimadzu UV-2400
PC series spectrophotometer, set at a sampling interval of 1 nm and
a slit width of 5 nm.

EIS of the solar cells were performed
at ambient conditions using a Bio-Logic electrochemical workstation,
between frequencies of 100 kHz and 10 mHz, keeping 0.5 V (∼Voc of the DSSC) as a constant DC voltage bias.
The method of carrying out EIS studies of DSSCs and their interpretation
has been systematically established by researchers in the past.40,41,57−59 The EIS spectra
were analyzed using the Z-Fit function in the E-C Lab software, by
selecting a suitable equivalent circuit model to extract the EIS parameters:
electron transport resistances, electron recombination, and the chemical
capacitance of the solar cells.

The performance characteristics
of the solar cells were studied using a solar simulator (Newport Corporation,
Oriel Class AAA). Keithley 2440 5A (Keithley, Inc.) source meter was
used to obtain the current density–voltage characteristics
of the solar cells. All the cells were tested at an illumination of
1 sun (AM 1.5G standard test conditions at 1000 W cm–2). Five samples of each configuration were fabricated and tested
multiple times to ensure the repeatability of the solar cell performances.
