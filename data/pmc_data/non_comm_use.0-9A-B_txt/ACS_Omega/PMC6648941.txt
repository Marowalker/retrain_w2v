In this study, the central composite
design of response surface
methodology was applied to optimize the ultrasonic synthesis of multiwalled
carbon nanotube-titanium dioxide (MWNT-TiO2) composites.
Twenty composites were prepared by adjusting three parameters (MWNT
concentration in water, sonication to disperse/exfoliate MWNTs in
water, and sonication to attach TiO2 onto MWNTs) at five
levels. On the basis of the experimental design, semiempirical expressions
were developed, analyzed, statistically assessed, and subsequently
applied to predict the impact of the studied parameters on composite
synthesis. The composite synthesis process was optimized to capture
the experimental conditions favoring the highest productivity (i.e.,
MWNT-TiO2 formation or percent TiO2 attachment)
utilizing minimal resources. The synthesis process optimization results
showed that, to make a MWNT-TiO2 composite in 10 mL of
water, 23.2 mg (∼99% of 23.4 mg) of TiO2 can be
attached to 2.6 mg of MWNTs. This process requires only 727 J sonication
energy, of which 592 J is invested to exfoliate MWNTs (Sonication
1) and 135 J to attach TiO2 (Sonication 2) to MWNTs. Finally,
the optimally synthesized composite was extensively characterized
using SEM, surface area and porosity analysis, TGA, and ζ-potential
analysis/DLS. Also, this composite was tested for stability under
variable pH and solvent polarity. The approach developed in this study
could be used to optimize the synthesis process of other similar composites.

1 Introduction
The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has been extensively
studied for removing organic pollutants from air and water.1−12 In water treatment experiments, TiO2 particles are often
used as suspensions in a batch slurry photoreactor.13,14 The slurry reactors are efficient at photocatalytic performance
but carry some economic and practical limitations. One of the big
problems of using TiO2 in slurry form is its recovery after
treatment so that it can be reused. The TiO2 crystalline
particles are usually nonporous; therefore, their size is reduced
to maximize their surface area for enhanced performance. This small
size carries with it the penalty of high filtration costs.15,16 Also, the performance of inner TiO2 particles (floating
deep inside the suspension) is adversely affected by outer surrounding
particles. Inner particles receive limited light to photoactivate17,18 because most of the light, including short-wavelength UV, is absorbed
by outer surrounding particles. Lastly, reports about the TiO2 toxicity in the recent literature have prompted calls for
its complete removal from the ecosystem.18 These issues have led to the development of supported photocatalysts
in recent years.17,19,20 The most desirable characteristics of photocatalysis support materials
include (i) enhancement of TiO2 photocatalysis, (ii) high
surface area to accommodate maximum attachment of TiO2,
and (iii) robustness to resist reactive species generated during photocatalysis.

The first common choice is finding the support for anatase TiO2 in its other crystalline forms. Anatase is selected for this
study because of its superior photoactivity performance among the
polymorphs of TiO2.10,21,22 Rutile phase TiO2 can be thermally attached to an inert
substrate (glass) and used as a support because it is the most stable
crystalline form (i.e., strong enough to resist reactive species)
and because it enhances the photocatalytic activity of anatase. The
literature reports an increased photoreactivity of mixed phase TiO2 compared to a pure phase one.2−8 This enhancement is believed to be due to a spatial separation at
the solid–solid interfaces, leading to reduced electron–hole
recombination.3−8 In the case of commercial Degussa P25 (usually 0.8:0.2 = anatase/rutile
mixture), the rutile acts as an electron sink,3,4,23 thereby delaying electron–hole recombination.
The enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of anatase and its
robustness against photoreactive species make rutile an eligible candidate
as a support material; however, it lacks a high surface area. Usually,
the surface area of rutile is equal to or less than that of anatase.21,24

Surface area limitations were resolved by replacing rutile
TiO2 with activated carbon, which is well known for its
high surface
area.25 Activated carbon was also found
to effectively enhance the photoreactivity of anatase.20,26−28 A few reports in the literature suggested activated
carbon’s superiority in enhancing the photocatalytic activity
of anatase compared to rutile (in Degussa P25).29,30 Therefore, activated carbon can be used as a support material owing
to its role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of anatase and
because of its high surface area;20,26−30 however, its amorphous structure is prone to degradation by photoreactive
species. Additionally, most of the surface area of activated carbon
is due to its micropores, sites that are unsuitable for anchoring
TiO2 because of the unavailability of light in such narrow
internal spaces.25

In this study,
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used to immobilize
TiO2. CNTs are known to enhance its photocatalytic activity
by delaying electron–hole recombination.6,23,31−38 More specifically, the immobilization of TiO2 onto multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was carried out with the aid of ultrasonication
(aka sonication). MWNTs were exfoliated by sonication in aqueous media
to allow TiO2 particles to attach to their surface. The
influence of operational sonication parameters on the exfoliation
of MWNTs and subsequent attachment of TiO2 was studied
by response surface methodology (RSM). RSM helps in determining the
quantitative relationship between controllable input parameters (variables
or factors) and their contribution to a desired response. Hence, it
optimizes the response surface with respect to process parameters.39,40 RSM requires the following design procedures:17,41 (i) a series of experiments to measure desired response adequately
and reliably; (ii) development of a best fit mathematical model for
a second-order response surface; (iii) determination of experimental
parameters that are most sensitive to the response; and (iv) the representation
of individual and interactive effects of factors on responses. RSM
can help in estimating the linear, interaction, and quadratic effects
of the factors and yields a prediction model for responses. Therefore,
it can be used to identify the optimal process settings for achieving
the efficient use of resources. The two most common designs used in
RSM are the Box–Behnken design (BBD) and the central composite
design (CCD).42−44 BBD is a three-level design, whereas CCD is a five-level
fractional factorial design that constructs the second-order response
surface. CCD is more frequently used because it gives almost as much
information as provided by multilevel factorial design. However, it
requires far fewer experiments than a full factorial design.45−47

Several researchers have used sonication for attaching metal
oxide
particles to carbonaceous materials.6 However,
to the best of our knowledge, no optimization study using RSM has
been performed to identify and quantify the role of sonication on
the formation of metal oxide-carbonaceous material composites. In
this study, RSM was applied to optimize TiO2 attachment
onto MWNTs to synthesize MWNT-TiO2 composites. The factors
investigated were (i) the concentration of MWNTs in water, (ii) sonication
to exfoliate MWNTs, and (iii) sonication to keep MWNTs exfoliated
and provide mixing to facilitate the attachment of TiO2 on their surfaces. The responses studied were (i) expansion of MWNT
bed volume in water and (ii) percent attachment of TiO2 on MWNTs. A model was developed, statistically tested, and experimentally
validated to represent the effect of factors on responses. Also, the
operational parameters were optimized to maximize the TiO2 attachment at minimum resource expenditure. Finally, the product
(MWNT-TiO2 composite) prepared from the optimized procedure
and its constituent materials (MWNTs and TiO2) were characterized
using electron microscopy, surface area and porosity analyses, TGA,
and ζ-potential analysis. Also, the composite was tested for
its structural integrity in extreme environments, such as highly acidic/basic
and polar/nonpolar media.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
2.1.1 Chemicals and Reagents
MWNTs, prepared
by catalytic carbon vapor deposition method having an average diameter
of 10–12 nm, and other chemicals, such as titanium dioxide
(anatase), potassium phosphate, hydrochloric acid, and sodium chloride,
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Fresh deionized
water with an average resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm was used
throughout the course of experimentation.

2.1.2 Sonication
and Filtration
Sonication
was performed using Q125 (QSonica LLC, Newton, CT, USA) with pre-optimized
sonicator operating parameters for MWNT dispersion (amplitude = 145
μm and pulse on/off cycle = 45/30 s). Vacuum filtration was
carried out on glass microfiber filters (GF/F) with an average pore
size of 700 nm using Millipore apparatus (Millipore Corp., Billerica,
MA, USA).

2.2 CCD for Synthesis and Optimization
of MWNT-TiO2 Composite
Synthesis of MWNT-TiO2 composite
was a four-step process: (i) addition of MWNTs to deionized water,
(ii) Sonication 1, to disperse/exfoliate MWNTs, (iii) addition of
TiO2, and (iv) Sonication 2, for mixing and further exfoliation
of MWNTs and to attach TiO2 onto MWNT surface. The mass
of TiO2 in step three was kept proportionally constant
to the mass of MWNTs in step one. The MWNT:TiO2 mass ratio
was 1:9 in all studied systems because MWNT-TiO2 composites
failed to form a film at higher concentrations of TiO2:
a critical characteristic required for surface coating and membrane
synthesis applications (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, the first, second, and fourth steps
(variables or factors) were analyzed and optimized by RSM, a chemometric
approach. CCD was developed to establish the relationship between
synthesis variables (factors) and product characteristics (responses):
(i) expansion/exfoliation of MWNTs and (ii) attachment of TiO2 to MWNTs.

The process of synthesis and optimization
of MWNT-TiO2 composite was divided into eight steps as
described below:1. Variables were evaluated to estimate
their correlation to responses. This helped in estimating the relative
importance of variables.

2. A model was developed to describe and
predict the influence of variables on responses.

3. The model was tested for its effectiveness
in predicting the responses.

4. Statistical analyses were performed
on the model to establish its validity. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
of the model and its terms was carried out for this purpose.

5. The contribution of the
individual
variables and the combined effects of variables on responses were
quantified. For this purpose, perturbation and Pareto plots were generated.

6. Optimization criteria were
developed.

7. The optimized
range of variables and
their effects on desirable responses were identified.

8. Finally, contours were developed to
exhibit the optimized region for the desired responses.



Design-Expert 9.0.6 software (Stat-Ease, Inc., MN, USA)
was used
for experimental design and the analysis of experimental data. Table 1 summarizes the ranges
and levels of the studied variables. The three factors were converted
to dimensionless variables (A, B, and C) with coded values at five levels. The dimensionless
variables were obtained by subtracting the actual value of variable
from its value at the central point and dividing it by the step chance
value because regression analysis could not be performed on raw physical
(dimensional) parameters. Coding was performed to normalize the parameters
because each coded variable is forced to range from −α
to +α (explained herein) so that it affects the response evenly.
The numerical ranges of variables were determined by preliminary experiments. Figure S2 shows the rotatable CCD experimental
points and design space that were followed in this study. CCD consists
of three types of points: factorial, axial, and central. The central
point is often used to calculate the experimental error. The distance
of an axial point from the center is denoted by α, and it depends
on a number of factors chosen for the design. The CCD approach reduced
the number of experiments from 53 =125, which were otherwise
required for full factorial design, to only 20. Accordingly, a total
of 20 experiments were performed to determine 8 factorial, 6 axial,
and 6 center points. The complete array of experiments and the exact
experimental conditions of factorial, central, and axial points of
CCD can be seen in Table 2.

2.3 MWNT Expansion and TiO2 Attachment
The dispersion of MWNTs was determined by a semiquantitative technique.
A stable (up to 24 h) expansion in bed volume of MWNTs after sonication
was considered proportional to its exfoliation. A specific mass of
MWNTs was allowed to expand during sonication. The volume occupied
by an expanded bed of MWNTs, hence obtained after sonication, was
divided by its initial bed volume. It was observed that, in the studied
sonication range, the bed volume of MWNTs in water expanded up to
∼16000 times compared to its initial bed volume. Figure S3 presents various stages of MWNT expansion
during sonication.

The unattached or residual TiO2 was quantified by UV–vis absorption following a reported
procedure48 (Figure S4). The method’s detection limit for TiO2 was 0.4 μg/mL. The input concentrations of TiO2 in our studied systems were 940–260 μg/mL. Therefore,
the method was capable of detecting down to <1% residual/unattached
TiO2 in all experiments.

2.4 Characterization
of MWNTs, TiO2, and MWNT-TiO2
The microstructure,
morphology,
surface area, pore size distribution, thermal stability, surface charge,
aggregation, and polydispersity (in water) of the MWNTs, TiO2, and MWNT-TiO2 composite were characterized. Also, the
MWNT-TiO2 composite was tested for structural stability
by dispersing in various organic solvents and in water at different
pH values.

SEM
The microstructures of MWNTs, TiO2,
and MWNT-TiO2 composite were examined by SEM using an FEI
Helios from FEI Co. (Hillsboro, OR, USA) operating at 5 keV. The sample
surface was coated with a 10 nm layer of gold and palladium using
a GATAN Model 682 PECS before imaging.

Surface Area and Pore Size
Distribution
BET surface
area and porosity were measured by a NOVA 2200e automated gas sorption
system (Quantachrome, FL, USA) using nitrogen gas at 77 K. The adsorption/desorption
isotherms were measured at a relative pressure (P/P0) ranging from 0.0001 to 0.99. The
BET equation was used to determine the specific surface area.

TGA
Thermal analysis was carried out using a PerkinElmer
thermogravimetric analyzer (Waltham, MA, USA) using nitrogen as a
carrier gas. The temperature was gradually increased from 30 to 800
°C using approximately 10 mg of sample.

ζ-Potential
The surface charges on MWNTs, TiO2, and MWNT-TiO2 were measured in water using a
ZetaPALS analyzer (Brookhaven, NY, USA). The Smoluchowski equation
was used to calculate ζ-potentials from electrophoretic mobilities.49 The details of ζ-potential measurements
can be found elsewhere.50

Aggregation
in Water
The aggregate sizes of MWNTs,
TiO2, and MWNT-TiO2 in water were measured at
23 ± 1 °C using the ZetaPALS analyzer (Brookhaven, NY, USA).
DLS was used to estimate the diameter of aggregates. The DLS (and
ζ-potential) measurements were performed by varying pH and conductivity
of the background solution using HCl, NaOH, phosphate buffer, and
NaCl. Prior to particulate size measurements, the MWNTs were suspended
in water with the aid of ultrasonication. A bath sonicator was used
for ultrasonication together with an established protocol51 to obtain stable suspensions.

Stability
of MWNT-TiO2 Composite
Interparticle
interactions between MWNTs and TiO2, responsible for the
structural integrity of the MWNT-TiO2 composite, were evaluated
by dispersing the composite in various solvents and pH solutions.
The mass percent of TiO2 leaving the composite was quantified
to estimate the disintegration of the composite. A series of solvents
with various polarities, ranging from 0.1 (hexane) to 10.2 (water)
on the polarity index,52 were selected
to assess hydrophobic interactions. Meanwhile, the electrostatic interactions
were evaluated by testing the TiO2 dislodging at pH 3 through
pH 10.5.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Evaluation of Design Parameters
The
20 MWNT-TiO2 composite experimental preparation runs using
different conditions (Figure 1a) demonstrated varying degrees of TiO2 attachment
as a function of MWNT concentration (Figure 1b). The Tyndall effect53 of residual TiO2 at the highest and the lowest
MWNT concentrations was clearly observable between runs 12 and 15,
respectively (Figure 1b). The Tyndall effect qualitatively describes the unattached TiO2 in suspension.

Figure 1 (a) Immobilization of TiO2 on MWNTs
to form MWNT-TiO2 composite with numbers corresponding
to experimental combinations
proposed by CCD in Table 2. (b) Attachment of TiO2 on MWNTs at different
parameter combinations. Tyndall effect (right) qualitatively exhibits
the presence of unattached TiO2 particles.

The first step toward understanding the interactions
between MWNTs
and TiO2 (to form MWNT-TiO2 composite) was to
evaluate the synthesis parameters with respect to their relationship
with composite formation. For this purpose, correlations between TiO2 attached and MWNT concentration (Figure S5), Sonication 1 (Figure S6), and
Sonication 2 (Figure S7) were evaluated.
Sonication 1 was primarily for MWNT expansion, and sonication 2 was
intended for MWNTs and TiO2 mixing to form MWNT-TiO2 composite. From the values of regression coefficient and
MWNT expansion trend (blue to red), it is concluded that Sonication
1 is the most influential parameter for MWNT-TiO2 composite
synthesis. A reasonable correlation (0.72) exists between Sonication
1 and percent TiO2 attached to MWNTs. The attachment of
TiO2 to MWNTs is directly proportional to Sonication 1,
which is correlated to MWNT expansion.

The sonication depends
on several parameters, including time of
sonication, the sonicator’s amplitude of vibration, pulse on/off
duration, temperature, pressure, the shape of the container, physical
(heat capacity, viscosity, density, boiling point), and chemical (inter-
and intramolecular binding) properties of the solvent.54 Unfortunately, the existing literature mostly
describes sonication in terms of only one parameter, that is, sonication
time. This led us to perform a separate study where we calibrated
the sonicator (for sonication energy) and established the relationship
between the sonicator’s parameters and delivered sonication
energy. There, a calorimetric approach was applied to calculate, model,
and optimize the sonication energy delivered by a sonicator to an
aqueous system. The details of the procedure adopted for calibration
and optimization of sonication energy can be found elsewhere.55 Another problem encountered was to estimate
the relationship between the sonication energy and the quality of
MWNT dispersions in water. For this purpose, the MWNT aggregate size
and its distribution were examined in relation to sonication energy
in various sonication conditions. The parameters that best dispersed
MWNTs were sonication time of 19–180 s, amplitude of vibration
of 144 μm, pulse on time of 24 s, and pulse off time of 15 s
for a 30 mL solution. The details of MWNT dispersions affected by
sonication can be found elsewhere.55

3.2 Model Development and Fitting
A second-order
polynomial equation was developed to fit the experimental data. The
general equation can be written as 1  where b0 is constant; b1, b2, and b3 are linear coefficients; b12, b13, and b23 are cross-product coefficients; and b11, b22, and b33 are quadratic coefficients. Equations 2–5
are the semiempirical relationships obtained by fitting the experimental
data to eq 1. MWNT expansion
2   3   %TiO2 attached
4   5  Equations 2 and 3 are developed
for MWNT expansion, and eqs 4 and 5 are for TiO2 attachment
on MWNTs. The coded equations (eqs 2 and 4) are useful to compute
the relative impact of factors on responses (see Section 2.2 for explanation of coding).
Meanwhile, the equations with actual factors (eqs 3 and 5) are derived
from coded equations by scaling the coefficients to accommodate the
units and are used to predict the responses quantitatively (using
the same units). The response for eqs 2 and 3 is MWNT expansion, and eqs 4 and 5 is percent TiO2 attachment. Equations 2 and 3 consist of three
statistically significant terms, indicating that individual effects
of factors are sufficient to explain MWNT expansion in water (Table S1). Unlike MWNT expansion, eqs 4 and 5 have
nine statistically significant terms, which exhibit the importance
of combined impact of factors (BC) and quadratic
effect of Sonication 1 (B), along with their individual
contribution toward TiO2 attachment to MWNTs.

To
establish the model, the experimental data were plotted against the
values predicted from models in eqs 3 and 5. The plots between experimental
and predicted MWNT expansion and percent TiO2 attachment
(Figure 2a,b, respectively)
both yielded a regression coefficient of ∼0.9, indicating a
good correlation of experimental data with predicted values. Finally,
the model was validated by performing ANOVA, which tests the significance
and adequacy of the model.

Figure 2 (a) Correlation between experimental and predicted
values of MWNT
expansion and (b) percent TiO2 attached on MWNTs to make
MWNT-TiO2 composite. The experimental data occur on both
sides of the predicted model response.

3.3 Analysis and Diagnostics of the Model
Results were obtained from ANOVA of the model developed for MWNT
exfoliation as represented by its volume expansion in water (eqs 2 and 3) (Table S1). The F-value
of 49.52 implies the significance of the model. The p-values for the overall model and its three individual terms are
below 0.0001, indicating their significance. The difference between
predicted and adjusted R2 is 0.06.Therefore,
on the basis of ANOVA, the model is acceptable for prediction.

ANOVA results were obtained for the model developed to predict percent
TiO2 attached to MWNTs (eqs 4 and 5) (Table S2). The high F-value of 29.14 is indicative
of model significance, that is, there is only 0.01% chance that this F-value is due to noise. The p-values for
the model and all its terms (except MWNT conc.) are below 0.05; that
is, they are significant. The difference between predicted and adjusted R2 is below 0.2, showing their reasonable agreement.
The ANOVA analysis, therefore, suggests the applicability of the model
to predict TiO2 attachment to MWNTs.

The model representing
MWNT expansion (eq 2)
carries three statistically significant
terms. It shows that MWNT concentration, Sonication 1, and Sonication
2 all individually influence MWNT expansion. A perturbation plot was
obtained by varying one factor at a time while keeping others constant
(Figure 3a). The influence
of each change on the response was monitored, and the slope of the
plot indicated the influence cast by the selected factor. Plotting
the factors together gives the relative impact of individual factors.
The negative slope of A (MWNT conc.) represents the
inversely proportional relationship between MWNT concentrations and
MWNT expansion (Figure 3a). Similarly, the positive slope of B (Sonication
1) is indicative of an increase in MWNT expansion with the increase
in Sonication 1. Factor C (Sonication 2) follows
the same trend as B, but its slope is less steep
than B, indicating its weaker positive contribution
to MWNT expansion. The perturbation plot helped in identifying the
important variables that were further diagnosed by plotting the contours
corresponding to the 3D response surfaces. In the case of MWNT expansion,
MWNT concentration and Sonication 1 are the most important variables.
Therefore, we refit the data to examine the impact of just these two
variables (Figure 3b). MWNT expansion is maximal at the lowest mass concentration and
the highest Sonication 1 (red bands).

Figure 3 (a) Perturbation plot for MWNT expansion.
Sonication 1 (B) and Sonication 2 (C) carry positive
slopes, whereas MWNT conc. (A) has a negative slope,
representing an increase in MWNT expansion with an increase of Sonication
1 and 2 and decrease of MWNT concentration. The x-axis of the perturbation plot is scaled according to coded values,
and the inset shows the actual values of the intersection point, which
is the center of the design space. (b) MWNT expansion as a function
of the combined effect of Sonication 1 and MWNT concentration. (c)
Perturbation plot for percent TiO2 attachment. Sonication
1 (B) and Sonication 2 (C) carry
positive slopes, indicating an increase in percent TiO2 attachment with an increase of Sonication 1 and 2, where MWNT concentration
is not playing any role (not shown). (d) Percent TiO2 attachment
as a function of the combined effect of Sonication 1 and Sonication
2. Red parabolic regions in the lower right corner and upper mid-right
regions represent the highest (≥99%) TiO2 attachment.
Interestingly, TiO2 attachment decreased upon increasing
Sonication 2 beyond 25 J/mL. The concentration of MWNTs was kept at
0.2 mg/mL to obtain panel (d) as shown in the figure key along with
the scale for percent TiO2 attachment.

Unlike MWNT expansion, the TiO2 attachment was
more
dependent on Sonication 2 than on MWNT concentration (Figure 3c). The Sonication 1 parameter,
however, remained the most influential factor. Another interesting
observation was the curvature in the perturbation lines representing
Sonication 1. The curvature exhibits a nonlinear response corresponding
to the change in the value of a certain variable. Figure 3d is helpful in identifying
the regions where maximum TiO2 attachment can be obtained
using the appropriate amount of Sonication 1 and Sonication 2.

Pareto analysis was performed to rank the effects of variables
on responses. It provided the quantitative measure of the contribution
of each significant model term (Figure 4). The Pareto analysis used the following equation
to calculate the contribution of individual and interacting factors 6  where Pn represents the percentage effect
of each factor and bn is the statistically
significant coefficient
of the polynomial equation (eq 1). In the case of MWNT expansion, eq 6 revealed that B (Sonication
1) contributes 60% to the process of expansion of MWNTs in water followed
by A and C, each contributing 20%
of the whole (not shown in Figure 4). In the case of TiO2 attachment, Figure 4 shows that B (Sonication 1, individually) was responsible for more
than half of the TiO2 attachment followed by its self-interaction
(B2), interaction with Sonication 2 (BC), Sonication 2 (C), self-interaction
of Sonication 2 (C2), and MWNT concentration
(A).

Figure 4 Pareto chart presenting percent contribution of MWNT concentration
(A), Sonication 1 (B), and Sonication
2 (C) to percent TiO2 attachment. BC represents the interaction contribution of Sonication
1 and Sonication 2. It can be inferred from the chart that the MWNT-TiO2 synthesis mostly depends upon Sonication 1 (B, B2, and BC).

3.4 Optimization
Next, we used the results
to optimize conditions for MWNT-TiO2 composite synthesis
(Table 3). The following
question was addressed: “How can TiO2 attachment
be maximized in the presence of the highest concentration of MWNTs
in water using the least amount of sonication energy?” The
final goal (i.e., TiO2 attachment) was assigned the maximum
importance followed by its supportive response (MWNT bed expansion)
while keeping MWNT concentration and Sonication 1 equally important.
Sonication 2 exhibited a minimal impact from the diagnostics established,
and therefore, it was assigned the minimum importance.

The closeness of response toward the target, termed as desirability,
can be mathematically defined as56 7  where n is
the number of responses in the measure and r is the
importance of responses from 1 (least important) to 5 (most important).
The responses are multiplied; therefore, if even a single response
reaches zero (falls outside their desirability range), the overall
function becomes zero. Ramp function graphs with blue and red dots
(Figure 5a) present
three key factors and their two responses, respectively. The height
of dot represents its desirability. A positive slope of the ramp represents
the maximization of numerical value (MWNT conc. and Sonication 2)
and vice versa (Sonication 2), defined in the optimization criteria.
A flat ramp is indicative of uniform desirability as in the case of
Sonication 1 and MWNT expansion. These two constraints are not specified
under strict goals (i.e., maximize or minimize) for two reasons: (i)
they are mutually inclusive, and (ii) manipulating them adversely
affects desirability. Their effect on desirability is pronounced because
of the extreme (5 out of 5) importance assignment to the ultimate
goal, that is, percent TiO2 attachment. Ramp graphs conclude
the achievement of 97.4% of the set criterion (desirability achievement)
when 0.26 mg/mL MWNTs were sonicated using 59.2 J/mL in the first
stage (Sonication 1) and 13.5 J/mL in the second stage (Sonication
2). Also, this resulted in 9800 times expansion of MWNTs’ original
volume and attachment of 98.8% of the TiO2 available in
the aqueous system.

Figure 5 (a) Desirability ramps for optimization criteria described
in Table 3. Ramps are
a graphical
representation of optimal solution. Flat ramps indicate uniform desirability
(Sonication 1 and MWNT expansion), whereas inclined ramps represent
minimum/maximum desired value. Red and blue dots represent factors
and responses, respectively. The height of dot corresponds to the
level of desirability achieved upon optimization. (b) Contour plot
for desirability achievement according to the defined criteria. Contour
plots for (c) MWNT expansion and (d) TiO2 attachment with
respect to Sonication 1 and MWNT concentration. The flags (inserted
in b, c, and d) indicate specific points within the confines of the
design and correspond to the optimum values shown in the ramps (a).

In the distribution of design
space with respect to desirability
(Figure 5b), the red
region in the contour represents the design space, where over 90%
desirability can be achieved. The “flag” in the right
top corner of the red region represents the optimized point of achieving
97.4% desirability, previously discussed in the ramp plots (Figure 5a). This optimized
point is very close to experimental run number 5 (factorial design
point) in Table 2 (Materials and Methods).

In our final analysis,
the effect of various factors on successful
composite synthesis was studied. This exercise will be helpful to
those who are interested in “responses” but do not generally
agree with our defined desirability criteria, for instance, someone
interested in only maximizing TiO2 attachment irrespective
of sonication energy expenditure (which we attempted to minimize for
Sonication 2). The MWNT expansion and percent TiO2 attachment
were plotted against the most influential factors, MWNT concentration
and Sonication 1 (Figure 5c,d, respectively). The top left corner of Figure 5c shows an orange region, which
represents that an expansion of MWNTs over 14000 times can be achieved
by lowering MWNT concentration down to 0.1 mg/mL and increasing Sonication
1 up to 60 J/mL. However, given the optimization criteria in Table 3, 9800 times expansion
in MWNT initial volume serves the purpose of achieving the maximum
(0.97) desirability. Similarly, a red region in Figure 5d is representative of the optimal zone,
where maximum (≥98%) TiO2 is attached to prepare
the composite. The flags are posted in Figure 5b–d to display our optimized design
points.

3.5 Characterization of MWNTs, TiO2, and MWNT-TiO2
SEM micrographs were used to
study the morphological structures of MWNTs, TiO2, and
MWNT-TiO2 composite (Figure 6a,b and Figure S8). A close
look reveals the wrapping of MWNTs over and around the TiO2 particles. The diameter of MWNTs was ∼10 to 12 nm.

Figure 6 SEM of MWNT-TiO2 at (a) 500 and (b) 100 nm magnification.
The images reveal the clustering of TiO2 around MWNTs having
∼12 nm diameter. (c) Adsorption/desorption isotherm of nitrogen
on MWNT-TiO2 composite to calculate BET surface area estimated
to be 48.6 m2/g. (d) Pore size distributions of MWNT-TiO2 and starting materials. MWNTs mostly contain mesopores, whereas
TiO2 contains micropores, resulting in the MWNT-TiO2 to inherit the porosity of both materials, containing mesopores
and micropores. (e) TGA of MWNT-TiO2 and starting materials
shows that MWNT-TiO2 is the most thermally stable compound
among the three. (f) ζ-potential of MWNT-TiO2 was
negative at the studied pH (3–9), which was similar to that
of TiO2. (g) Aggregation of MWNT-TiO2 in water,
at different pH, indicates that the composite’s aggregate diameter
was less than 1 μm. The polydispersity index values indicate
that the MWNT-TiO2 aggregates were fairly monodispersed
at all studied pH (except pH 3 which seems closer to the isoelectric
point of MWNT-TiO2).

Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of MWNT-TiO2 composite showed the MWNT-TiO2 carried a specific
surface
area of 48.6 m2/g (Figure 6c), which is lower than that of MWNTs (440.7 m2/g) but higher than TiO2 (15.6 m2/g)
(calculated from Figure S9). The weight
ratio suggests the specific surface area of MWNT-TiO2 composite
to be 58.1 m2/g, which is 17% more than the observed one
(48.6 m2/g). This decrease in surface area of the composite
can be attributed to the decrease in nitrogen adsorption at interfaces
of the two parent materials (MWNTs and TiO2) as can be
seen in the SEM micrographs (Figure 6a,b). The pore size distributions of MWNTs, TiO2, and MWNT-TiO2 composite indicate that the majority
of the pores in MWNTs are mesopores, whereas TiO2 carries
micropores in excess (Figure 6d). The MWNT-TiO2 composite inherits the porosity
of both starting materials (Figure S10).
There is evidence for the formation of some new pores in the MWNT-TiO2 composite, which can be potential adsorption sites for appropriately
sized molecules.

TGA of MWNTs, TiO2, and MWNT-TiO2 showed,
contrary to expectations, the MWNT-TiO2 composite was thermally
more stable than its both parent materials (Figure 6e). The 10% MWNTs in the composite did not
decompose throughout the studied range of temperature; instead, the
mass of the composite kept on fluctuating above its original mass
until 600 °C. It is hypothesized that TiO2 entirely
covered the MWNTs, leaving minimal free MWNTs. This can be seen in
the SEM images (Figure 6a,b) as well. The fluctuation in the mass of composite might be due
to the formation of functional groups at MWNT/TiO2 junctions
upon the increase in temperature because nitrogen and trace air were
present in the atmosphere. It leads to the expectation of increased
catalytic reactivity of MWNT-TiO2 composite as compared
to the TiO2 alone.

The ζ-potential was indicative
of ionically stabilized colloid
systems (Figure 6f).
They were mostly negative and are comparable to TiO2 (see Figure S11). ANOVA revealed that except for pH
3.0 and 10.5, the ζ-potentials of TiO2 and MWNT-TiO2 are statistically indistinguishable from 0 at 95% confidence
level. (The F-critical value was 4.5, where F-values for the measurements at pH 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, and
10.5 were 48.3, 3.4, 4.3, 0.44, 0.38, and 60.11.) This supports our
hypothesis that the MWNTs were mostly surrounded by TiO2 particles. MWNT aggregation was mostly random, with a high polydispersity
index, except at higher pH (Figure S12a). Meanwhile, TiO2 particles were fairly monodispersed
with small hydrodynamic radii (Figure S12b). The addition of MWNTs to TiO2 (to form MWNT-TiO2 composite) increased the average aggregate size of TiO2 particles and slightly altered their polydispersity (Figure 6g).

Several
factors can be responsible for holding MWNT and TiO2 together
in a composite (Figure S13a). Hydrophobic
interactions were examined by observing the dispersion
of MWNT-TiO2 composites in a series of solvents with different
polarities: hexane (0) < dichloromethane (3.1) < isopropanol
(3.9) < acetone (5.1) < acetonitrile (5.8) < water (9) showed
the TiO2 leaving the composite was always below our method
detection limit of 0.9 mg/L (corresponding to 0.04% mass of the initially
attached TiO2). The electrostatic interactions were tested
by changing the pH of the background aqueous solution from pH 3 to
10.5 (Figure S13b). A maximum of 1.6% TiO2 was observed to leave the composite at pH 10.5. Therefore,
it can be assumed that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions
were not the significant attraction forces between MWNT and TiO2 in a MWNT-TiO2 composite. Hence, the composite
can withstand extreme pH and polar/nonpolar background solvents without
significantly disintegrating into its constituents.

4 Conclusions
The following conclusions were derived from
this study:1. The MWNT-TiO2 composite
can be prepared in a single pot following four steps: (i) addition
of MWNTs to water, (ii) sonication to exfoliate MWNTs, (iii) addition
of TiO2, and (iv) sonication to mix and attach TiO2 to MWNTs.

2. MWNT
exfoliation (proportional to its
bed volume expansion) by sonication is the most important parameter
responsible for attachment of TiO2 to MWNTs for MWNT-TiO2 composite synthesis.

3. MWNT bed volume in water can be expanded
up to ∼16000 times by providing only 59 J/mL sonication energy
in water under specific conditions (MWNT conc. = 0.13 mg/mL, vibration
amplitude = 144 μm, and pulse on/off cycle = 24/15 s).

4. Over 99% of TiO2 attachment
to MWNTs can be achieved by optimizing MWNT concentration and sonication.

5. RSM is a powerful technique
to obtain
the optimum experimental design for MWNT-TiO2 composite
synthesis and optimization.i. A polynomial equation (model) was fitted
to describe factors affecting MWNT-TiO2 composite synthesis.

ii. The model was tested statistically
and experimentally.

iii. The significant terms in models were
analyzed, and their impact on responses was monitored.

iv. The optimum MWNT-TiO2 synthesis
conditions, to maximize yield using minimal resources, were identified.



6. Characterization using SEM, TGA, ζ-potential
analysis/DLS technique indicated the MWNTs being completely surrounded
by TiO2 particles in a MWNT-TiO2 composite.
The surface area and porosity analysis provided evidence for the attachment
of TiO2 on MWNTs through 17% reduction in overall surface
area while mostly conserving the porosity of the parent materials.
The stability of MWNT-TiO2 composite, in various solvents
and at different pH, establishes reasonably strong interactions between
MWNT and TiO2 to hold the constituents together in a composite.
