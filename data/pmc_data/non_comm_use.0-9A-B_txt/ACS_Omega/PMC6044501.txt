A facile ruthenium(II)-catalyzed
regiospecific C–H/O–H
oxidative annulation methodology was developed to construct isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazines. This methodology delivers various advantages,
such as scope for diverse substrates, tolerance to a range of functional
groups, stability under air, and yields regioselective products. This
methodology was successfully applied to synthesize far red (FR) fluorescent
probes for live cancer cell imaging. The synthesized compounds displayed
notable fluorescence properties in solution and thin-film. Their application
in live cancer cell imaging was investigated using various cancer
cell lines. The synthesized compound showed prominent FR fluorescence,
with high quantum yield, and exhibited better cell-imaging properties,
with excellent biocompatibility.

Introduction
Transition metal-catalyzed
C–H bond functionalization has
evolved rapidly because of its potential to create a diverse range
of products efficiently without the requirement to prepare preactivated
starting material.1 The advantages
of this methodology are that it is atom economical, has a reduced
number of reaction steps, and produces minimal waste.2 Transition metal catalysts are effective and efficient
for annulation via chelation-assisted functionalization of C–H/N–H
and/or C–H/O–H bonds.3 Even
though great advances in C–H annulation have been executed
in recent years, the skill to selectively functionalize precise sp2 C–H bonds in the presence of contending C–H
bonds persists as the critical and strategic feature for the success
of this tandem process.4

Cancer is
the primary cause of death in developed countries and
the second leading cause of death in developing countries.5 Improvement in the methodology for early detection
of benign and propagated tumor cells in patients is extremely significant
to the success of cancer therapy and improvement in the survival rates
of patients.6 Nowadays, optical imaging
methodologies are evolving as promising noninvasive, real-time and
high-resolution modalities for the diagnosis of cancer.7 Because of better cell permeability and minimal
perturbation to living systems, low molecular weight organic fluorophores
are extremely appropriate for biological studies.8 Among the organic fluorophores for in vivo bioanalysis
and bioimaging, far red/near-infrared (FR/NIR) fluorophores (λ
= 650–900 nm)9 have been shown to
be promising molecules due to their low-light scattering, deep-tissue
penetration and marginal photodamage.10 Hence, the FR/NIR fluorescent probes are likely to be appropriate
for biological imaging.11 However, the
development of novel FR/NIR fluorophores with requisite properties
for biological imaging is an appealing and significantly challenging
task.

For proficient cancer cell fluorescence imaging, FR/NIR
probes
must exhibit greater chemical and photophysical properties, such as
high quantum yield for intense fluorescence, large Stokes shift for
least interference between absorption and emission spectra, adequate
chemical and photostability in solvents, buffers, or biological conditions,
less cytotoxicity, and suitable chemical functionality for bioconjugation
with specific scaffolds for the purpose of targeting. For the construction
of fluorescent probes, polycyclic heteroaromatic molecules (PHAs)
with extended π-conjugated structures have been proven to be
better chromophores in numerous reports. Significantly, PHAs are disclosed
as NIR-active dyes, two-photon absorbers, and fluorescence sensors.12

We have already explored Rh(III)-catalyzed
dehydrogenative C–H/N–H
functionalization to synthesize cinnoline derivatives as fluorescent
probes for live cancer cell imaging in our recent work.13 In the course of our efforts on the development
of novel transition metal-catalyzed C–H functionalization14 and annulation reactions,15 with the aim of design and synthesis of novel organic fluorophores,16 we report here Ru(II)-catalyzed regiospecific
C–H/O–H oxidative annulation reaction to synthesize
isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazine, which was successfully
applied as an FR fluorescent probe for live cancer cell imaging.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazines
Initially, benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol 1a was treated with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (5 mol %), AgSbF6 (20 mol %), Cu(OAc)2·H2O (1 equiv), and diphenyl acetylene 2a (1.5 equiv) in toluene (5 mL) at 110 °C under nitrogen for
12 h. After completion of the reaction evidenced by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC), the product 3a was isolated by column chromatography,
with the yield of 14% (Table 1, entry 1). The structure of the product was confirmed as
a highly substituted isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazine
(3a) using various analytical techniques, such as high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS), 1H and 13C NMR, and
single crystal X-ray diffraction (Supporting Information). When the reaction was performed under air, the yield was improved
to 30% (Table 1, entry
2). Switching the solvent from toluene to chlorobenzene (PhCl) under
identical reaction conditions provided the annulated product 3a in an improved yield of 40%. When other solvents, such
as 1,4-dioxane, t-AmOH, CH3OH, dimethylformamide
(DMF), and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) (Table 1, entries 3–7) were employed in this
reaction, 1,2-DCE provided the best yield of 72% (Table 1, entry 7). Further, varying
the oxidant from Cu(OAc)2·H2O to Cu(OAc)2, AgOAc, Ag2CO3, K2S2O8, and PhI(OAc)2 under identical conditions
to that of Table 1,
entry 7, did not improve the yield of product 3a (Table 1, entries 8–12).
Reducing the amount of oxidant to 0.5 equiv decreased the yield, and
without the oxidant, it failed to afford the desired compound 3a (Table 1, entries 13–14). Similarly, replacing AgSbF6 with
other additives, such as KPF6 and AgBF4, afforded
the product in reduced yields (Table 1, entries 15–16). Absence of the additive AgSbF6 also delivered very low yield (Table 1, entry 17). Moreover, replacing the catalyst
[RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 with RuCl2·5H2O, [RhCp*Cl2]2 and
Pd(OAc)2 did not improve the results (Table 1, entries 18–20).

Under optimized
reaction conditions, we first scrutinized the scope
of versatility in the oxidative annulation of benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol 1a by employing diversely substituted
alkynes (2a–m) (Table 2). Symmetric diaryl acetylenes
bearing various substitutions such as electron-donating methyl and
methoxy at the para position coupled smoothly with 1a in 65 and 57% yields, respectively (3b–c). Diaryl acetylene bearing halogen groups at the para position
of the benzene ring was generally well tolerated and afforded products 3d–f in moderate to good isolated yields
of 50–64%. Substitution of the strong electron-withdrawing
groups at the para position of the phenyl ring provided 3g in 39% yield. This reaction is also compatible with 1,2-di(naphthalene-diaryl
acetylene) by which product 3h was isolated in 50% of
the yield.

a Reaction conditions: 1 (0.3 mmol), 2 (0.3 mmol), [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (5.0 mol %), Cu(OAc)2·H2O (1 equiv),
and AgSbF6 (20 mol %) in 1,2-DCE at
reflux for 12 h under air.

b Isolated yield.

To understand
the regioselectivity of the present reaction, unsymmetrical
alkyne was used as the substrate for the reaction with 1a. Thus, 1-phenyl-1-propyne acetylene 2i gave the single
regioisomeric product 3i in 68% yield. The present catalytic
reaction was successfully extended to the symmetrical aliphatic alkynes 2j–m, which offered moderate to good isolated
yields (3j–m). We next explored the
scope and limitations of benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol substrates
(1b–h) in this coupling reaction with diphenyl
acetylene 2a. Dibromo substitutions in benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol decreased yield of the product 3o (58%). Diphenyl substitutions in the ortho and para positions afforded 3p and 3q in 67 and 70% yield, respectively.
The reaction underwent smoothly with highly substituted triphenylamine
tagged benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol and yielded 3r in 56%. In addition, substitution of the electron-withdrawing groups,
such as CN, delivered the product 3s in 67% yield. Interestingly,
a very high yield of 3t (80%) was observed when the phenyl
ring was replaced by the cyclohexyl ring.

To check intermolecular
competitive reaction between the electron-deficient
diphenyl acetylene (2a) and electron-rich 4-octyne (2l), we studied the annulation reaction, as indicated in Scheme 1. Benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol (1a) was reacted with an equimolar mixture
of 2a and 2l under optimized conditions.
Notably, the annulated product, 3a, originating from
the electron-deficient alkyne (2a), was obtained in higher
proportion (1.7/1.0) compared to that of product 3l,
originating from the electron-rich alkyne (2l).

Scheme 1 Control
Experiment
To achieve a preliminary
understanding of the mechanism, deuterium
exchange experiments were conducted. Heating the combination of 1a and CD3OD in 1,2-DCE at 100 °C provided 1aa, with one incorporated D atom (Scheme 2, eq 1). Under the standard procedure, heating
the combination of 1a and CD3OD in 1,2-DCE
at 100 °C provided 1ab in a significant D/H exchange
in the peri-position (Scheme 2, eq 2), thereby providing evidence for the reversible C–H
bond ruthenation step in this annulation reaction. In both reactions,
no O–H deuteration was detected, which could be rationalized
by the labile O–D/H exchange during the workup on silica gel
chromatography.

Scheme 2 Preliminary Mechanism Study
On the basis of the experimental results and previous
report,17 the plausible mechanism for the
formation of
isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazine (3) by
the direct Ru(II)-catalyzed cyclisation of benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol (1) with alkynes (2) is
shown in Scheme 3.
The additive AgSbF6 likely initiates the catalytic reaction
by dissociation of the dimeric form of the ruthenium complex [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 and gives a reactive
cationic ruthenium species. Then, the ruthenium complex gets attached
with the directing group OH and forms the intermediate A. Then, peri-C–H metalation of the intermediate A provides a five-membered ruthenacycle intermediate B. Now, alkyne 2 attaches with the intermediate B giving rise to intermediate C. At this point,
coordinative regioselective insertion of alkyne 2 into
the Ru–C bond of intermediate C gives intermediate D. Finally, the ruthenium complex that is regenerated by Cu(OAc)2 forms the isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazine (3).

Photophysical Properties
After we had a diverse library
of isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazine in hand, their photophysical
properties in solution and thin-film states, including absorptions,
emissions, and quantum yields, were investigated (Supporting Information).18 It is
worth mentioning that synthesized compounds exhibit emissions (λmax,em: 532–632 nm in dichloromethane (DCM); 565–640
nm in thin-film) with large Stokes shifts (up to 4853 cm–1 in DCM; 5747 cm–1 in thin-film) and high fluorescence
quantum yields (up to 86% in DCM) (Table 3).

Compound 3a displays
emissions (λmax,em) of 553 and 590 nm with Stokes
shifts of 2160 and 2736 cm–1 in DCM and thin film,
respectively, and fluorescence quantum yield
of 54% in DCM. We studied the impact of R1 and R2 in the aromatic alkynes by varying the substitution by 3b (R1 = R2 = CH3), 3c (R1 = R2 = OCH3), 3d (R1 = R2 = F), 3e (R1 = R2 = Cl), 3f (R1 = R2 = Br), and 3g (R1 = R2 = NO2). Interestingly, OCH3 (3c) and F
(3d) substitutions increase the emission value, with
larger Stokes shifts when compared to the results with compound 3a. However, compound 3c shows quantum yield
of 48%, which is comparable to 3a (54%), whereas 3d shows lesser quantum yield of 35%. On the other hand, NO2 substitution quenched the fluorescence.

When a naphthyl
ring (3h) was employed instead of
a phenyl ring (3a), compound 3h showed a
reduced emission wavelength and quantum yield. Subsequently, the influence
of the R1 and R2 substituents in the aliphatic
alkynes (3j–m) was examined. Compounds 3j (R1 = R2 = CH3), 3k (R1 = R2 = CH2CH3), 3l (R1 = R2 = (CH2)2CH3), and 3m (R1 =
R2 = (CH2)3CH3) demonstrate
similar absorptions (497, 501, 499, and 503 nm, respectively) and
emission wavelengths (563, 563, 563, and 567 nm, respectively) in
DCM. However, compound 3m exhibits higher quantum yield
of 65% compared to that with 3j (41%).

Once variations
in the alkynes were studied, we then explored the
variations in benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol (1). When comparing the emission wavelengths of compounds 3a and 3n–r, a notable bathochromic
shift was observed for the compounds 3o, 3p, and 3r. Even though 3o and 3r show lesser quantum yield of 12 and 37%, respectively, compound 3p, shows a much higher quantum yield of 86% compared to that
of 3a (54%). When the phenyl ring in 3a was
replaced by the cyano groups (3s), a significant bathochromic
shift was observed from 590 to 630 nm, with a large Stokes shift change
from 2736 to 3658 cm–1. The phenyl ring in 3a was replaced by the cyclohexyl ring (3t),
whereas a much higher rise in Stokes shift from 2736 to 5747 cm–1 was observed, with only a slight variation of the
emission wavelengths and quantum yield.

After we examined the
physical properties of the diverse substituted
compounds, we designed 3u and 3v by the
combination of 3c, 3o, and 3s to obtain compounds with enhanced physical properties. Compounds 3u and 3v disclose a large bathochromic shift
with wavelengths of 637 and 640 nm, respectively (Figures 1 and 2).

The fluorescence solvatochromism of 3p was studied
in several solvents, and the results are presented in Figure 3. Compound 3p displays
a large positive solvatochromism, with strong fluorescence. Compound 3p unveils solvatochromism with a bathochromic shift by an
increase in the solvent polarity from toluene to dimethyl sulfoxide,
the green, yellow, orange, and red regions of the visible spectrum
covering them. Notably, the fluorescence of compound 3p in methanol shifted radically to the higher wavelength (λmax,em = 610 nm). The reason for this strong solvatochromism
is owing to the combination of intramolecular charge transfer and
dipole–solvent interactions in solution.19

Density Functional Theory
(DFT) Calculations
DFT calculation
of compound 3p at B3LYP-6-311G level was estimated, and
the results are shown in Figure 4. On the basis of the DFT calculation, the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) is mostly covered on the phenazine moiety,
whereas the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is largely confined
around the chromene moiety.

(B) diagrams of 3p.

Application for Live Cancer Cell Imaging
For live cancer
cell imaging, 3p was investigated using various cancer
cells, such as A549 (lung cancer cells), HepG2 (liver cancer cells),
and U937 (lymphoma cells), due to its high quantum yield.20 Compound 3p (10 μM) was added
to the tested cell cultures and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min.
Later, the cells were stained with nucleus staining dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (2 μM) for another 20 min. To our delight, 3p effectively entered the cell membranes of the tested cancer cells,
labeled with an intense FR luminescence when compared to the fluorescence
images of the cells before and after the treatment with 3p (Figure 5). This
showed the potential of compound 3p in intracellular
imaging in the tested cancer cells. It is noteworthy that during the
cell imaging experiment, the tested cells were healthy and unharmed
and displayed an adherent morphology. From this study, we conclude
that compound 3p could be used for live cancer cell imaging
(Supporting Information).

Cell Viability Assay
We studied the cytotoxicity of
the synthesized compound 3p, which is an important factor
for cell-imaging applications (Figure 6). The MTS assay method was applied to test the cytotoxicity
of compound 3p by adding up to 200 μM of the compound
in the tested cancer cell culture. The observed cytotoxicity is very
nominal for compound 3p against that of the tested cancer
cells, such as A549, HepG2, and U937. Because of the excellent biocompatibility,
the synthesized compound 3p could be utilized as a fluorescent
bioprobe in live cancer cell imaging.

Conclusions
In
summary, we developed a novel Ru(II)-catalyzed C–H/O–H
oxidative annulation reaction to obtain isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazines. This synthetic methodology offers various advantages,
such as diverse substrates in a range of functional groups executed
under air, and yields regioselective products. This methodology was
successfully applied to design and synthesize FR fluorescent probes
for live cancer cell imaging. Photophysical properties were examined
both in solution and thin-film states. Notably, synthesized compounds
displayed green to FR emissions with large Stokes shifts and high
fluorescence quantum yields. Furthermore, 3p shows a
large positive solvatochromism, with strong fluorescence. To study
the photophysical properties, DFT calculation was done to look at
the possible HOMO and LUMO properties. Among the synthesized compounds, 3p was investigated for live cancer cell imaging due to its
high quantum yield. Compound 3p labeled the cancer cells
efficiently with an intense FR luminescence by passing through the
cell membranes. It is noteworthy that the tested cells were unharmed
and displayed an adherent morphology during the cell-imaging experiments.
We successfully demonstrated 3p as a fluorescent bioprobe
in live cancer cell imaging, as a result of its prominent FR fluorescence,
high quantum yield, and excellent biocompatibility.

Synthetic Procedures
General Procedure for Synthesis of Isochromeno[8,1-ab]phenazines (3a–v)
To an oven-dried 25
mL round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser were added benzo[a]phenazin-5-ol 1a (73.88 mg, 0.3 mmol, 1.0
equiv), diphenyl acetylene 2a (53.43 mg, 0.3 mmol, 1.0
equiv), [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (9.18
mg, 0.015 mmol, 0.05 equiv), AgSbF6 (20.62 mg, 0.06 mmol,
0.2 equiv), Cu(OAc)2·H2O (59.89 mg, 0.3
mmol, 1.0 equiv) in 3.0 mL of 1,2-DCE. The reaction mixture was refluxed
for 12 h. After cooling to ambient temperature, the reaction mixture

Computational Calculations
DFT calculation of compound 3p was carried out using the Gaussian 09 program package.
Ground state geometries of the boron dyes were optimized using DFT-B3LYP-6-311G
basis set. To get information about absorption properties, time-dependent
density functional theory calculations are carried out using the optimized
geometries.

Live Cancer Cell-Imaging Experiment
Fluorescence compound 3p was examined for intracellular
imaging in A549, HepG2,
and U937 cells. A549 and HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), and U937 cells were grown in
RMPI media, with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin
at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. The cells
were incubated at 37 °C with 10 μM of compound 3p for 30 min. After thorough washing with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), the cells were stained with nucleus staining dye DAPI (2 μM)
for another 20 min. Thereafter, the staining solution was replaced
with fresh PBS to remove the remaining dye. Finally, the blue and
red fluorescence images of A549, HepG2, and U937 cells were captured
using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM710; ZEISS). The excitation
wavelength for blue: 405 nm; emission collection: 410–460 nm;
excitation wavelength for red: 561 nm; emission collection: 570–680
nm.

Cell Viability Assay
Cytotoxic properties of the synthesized
compound 3p were studied against A549, HepG2, and U937
cells. A549 and HepG2 cells were maintained in a complete tissue culture
medium DMEM, and U937 cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute medium, with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM l-glutamine,
along with antibiotics (about 100 IU mL–1 of penicillin,
100 μg mL–1 of streptomycin), with the pH
adjusted to 7.2. A medium of 50 μL containing 5000 cells per
well and different concentrations of compounds 3p was
seeded in 96-well plates. The cells were cultivated at 37 °C,
with 5% CO2 and 95% air, in 100% relative humidity. AQueous
One Solution reagent of 20 μL was added to each well of CellTiter
96 according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and incubated
at 37 °C for 1–4 h under a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cytotoxicity against cells was determined by measuring
the absorbance of the converted dye at 490 nm in an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent (immunoadsorbent) assay reader. Cytotoxicity of each
sample was expressed as an IC50 value.
