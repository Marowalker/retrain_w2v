In recent years,
production of fatty acid derivatives has attracted
much attention because of their wide range of applications in renewable
oleochemicals. Microorganisms such as Saccharomyces
cerevisiae provided an ideal cell factory for such
chemical synthesis. In this study, an efficient strategy for the synthesis
of fatty alcohols based on enhanced supply of free fatty acids (FFAs)
was constructed. The FAA1 and FAA4 genes encoding two acyl-CoA synthetases in S. cerevisiae were deleted, resulting in the accumulation of FFAs with carbon
chain length from C8 to C18. The coexpression of the carboxylic acid
reductase gene (car) from Mycobacterium
marinum and the phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene
(sfp) from Bacillus subtilis successfully converted the accumulated FFAs into fatty alcohols.
The concentration of the total fatty alcohols reached 24.3 mg/L, which
is in agreement with that of the accumulated FFAs. To further increase
the supply of FFAs, the DGAI encoding the acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol
acyltransferase involved in the rate-limiting step of triacylglycerols
storage was codeleted with FAA1 and FAA4, and the acyl-CoA thioesterase gene (acot) was
expressed together with car and sfp, resulting in an enhanced production of fatty alcohols, the content
of which increased to 31.2 mg/L. The results herein demonstrated the
efficiency of the engineered pathway for the production of fatty acid
derivatives using FFAs as precursors.

Introduction
Known as important precursors for valuable
chemicals, fatty acids
have attracted tremendous attention for biological production of a
variety of fatty acid derivatives, including biodiesel, fatty aldehydes,
fatty alcohols, and alkanes/alkenes, some of which are promising substitutes
for fossil fuels.1−3 A great deal of efforts have been made in the microbial
production of fatty derivatives from fatty acids in recent years,4,5 and particularly, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regarded to be a potential natural cell factory based on its
rapid growth rate, genetic traceability, robust genetic tools, high
product yield, and good tolerance to harsh fermentation conditions.6,7

In S. cerevisiae, biosynthesis
of
fatty acids is initiated by condensing acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA,
and the final step is catalyzed by the transferase activity, which
substitutes CoA for acyl carrier protein (ACP), releasing fatty acyl-CoAs.8 The generated fatty acyl-CoAs are then fed into
lipid storage, which mainly existed in the form of triacylglycerols
(TAGs) or phospholipids. In addition, the free fatty acids (FFAs)
in S. cerevisiae could be rapidly converted
to fatty acyl-CoAs by fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, encoded by FAA genes.9 The biosynthesis
of fatty acid is in turn to be feedback inhibited by the fatty acyl-CoAs
with an extremely low intracellular titer.10,11 As such, the production level of both FFAs and fatty acyl-CoAs in S. cerevisiae is quite low.

Although fatty
acids are important building blocks for fatty acid
derivatives, their storage forms of TAGs or phospholipids are unable
to be directly converted to the target components. A variety of converting
enzymes, including wax ester synthase (WS)/acyltransferase (AT) for
the synthesis of biodiesel,12,13 fatty acyl-CoA reductase
(FAR) for the synthesis of fatty alcohols/aldehydes,14,15 aldehyde decarbonylase (AD)/carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) for
the synthesis of fatty aldehyde,16−18 and others such as lipoxygenase
(LOX) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL),19 all
use FFAs or fatty acyl-CoAs as precursors. Thus, the activation of
fatty acids through engineering the yeast cells is necessary for the
efficient biosynthesis of the desired compounds.

In our previous
study, the acyl-CoA-dependent TAG biosynthesis
pathway was engineered by deleting the rate-limiting enzyme acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol
acyltransferase (DAGAT) encoded by dga1, to accumulate
fatty acyl-CoAs for the production of fatty acid derivatives. The
subsequent overexpression of an alcohol-forming FAR successfully converted
the accumulated fatty acyl-CoAs to fatty alcohols, resulting in the
production of fatty alcohols in S. cerevisiae at a concentration of 45 mg/L.15 This
strategy ideally solved the bottleneck using the storage forms of
fatty acids for the production of target derivatives. Because fatty
acyl-CoA regulated the biosynthesis of fatty acids, the blockage of
TAG synthesis pathway limited the metabolic flux toward the accumulation
of fatty acyl-CoA. As such, further increase in fatty acid derivatives
in the above-engineered strain is difficult to achieve.

To overproduce
target derivatives, the regulatory inhibition by
acyl-CoA should be relieved and the flux from fatty acyl-CoAs to FFAs
is regarded to be a common strategy. Therefore, another strategy is
then focused on the utilization of FFAs as precursors. We previously
reported that deletion of FAA1 and FAA4 encoding two acyl-CoA synthetases together with the expression
of acyl-CoA thioesterase (acot) successfully accumulated
FFAs to a much higher level.20 Among the
converting enzymes, the CAR was discovered to be a versatile enzyme
that can directly use FFAs to synthesize fatty acid derivatives, such
as fatty aldehydes.18 Therefore, S. cerevisiae was designed for metabolic engineering
from this perspective in this study. On the basis of the FAA1/FAA4 deletion strain, the FFAs were expectedly
accumulated and the CAR was then introduced into the mutant strain,
to convert the accumulated FFAs to fatty acid derivatives. The final
product produced in the engineered strain was compared with the previously
engineered strains with modified TAG synthesis pathway, to investigate
the productive capacity of fatty acid derivatives. The study herein
aims to look for an alternative strategy realizing the efficient biosynthesis
of fatty acid derivatives from the fatty acids in S.
cerevisiae.

Results and Discussion
Pathway Engineering for
the Production of Enhanced Fatty Acid
Derivatives
To realize the successful de novo production
of fatty acid derivatives, a fatty acid-dependent pathway was metabolically
engineered to supply efficient precursors. Differing from our previous
strategy, which increased the production levels of fatty acyl-CoAs,
the strategy herein aims to enhance the supply of FFAs. The FAA1 and FAA4 genes encoding the acyl-CoA
synthetases were deleted according to the previous study, and the
CAR was coexpressed with 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase
(SFP) to convert the FFAs to their derivatives. To further increase
the yield of fatty acid derivatives, the acyl-CoA:DAGAT was also deleted
and the acyl-CoA thioesterase fragment was integrated into the genome
of the engineered yeast, to block the formation of TAGs, resulting
in the release of more FFAs (Figure 1).

enhanced supply of FFAs as precursors. FAA1/FAA4: genes encoding the two acyl-CoA synthetases; DGAI: gene encoding the diglyceride acyltransferase; acot: gene encoding the acyl-CoA thioesterase from M. musculus; car: gene encoding

Efficient Release of FFAs Based on the Deletion
of FAA1, FAA4, and DGAI and Introduction
of acot
According to the above strategy,
the release of FFAs was investigated. The deletion of FAA1 and FAA4 encoding the acyl-CoA synthetases effectively
increased the production level of FFAs. The FFAs mainly detected in
ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4 strain were
myristic acid (C14:0 fatty acid), cetyl acid (C16:0 fatty acid), palmitoleyl
acid (C16:1 fatty acid), stearic acid (C18:0 fatty acid), and oleic
acid (C18:1 fatty acid), and small amounts of octanoic acid (C8:0
fatty acid), capric acid (C10:0 fatty acid), and lauric acid (C12:0
fatty acid) was also observed. The codeletion of DGAI and the integration of acot further enhanced the
production level of FFAs including C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, and
C18:1, with maximum yields of 18.3, 83.3, 92.1, 36.8, and 38.4 mg/L,
which were increased by 43, 18, 15, 19, and 24%, respectively, compared
with those of ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4 strain. However, the yield of medium-chain FFAs was not further
increased (Figure 2). In the wild-type strain, even though small amounts of C16:0 and
C18:0 were detected, other FFAs were not detectable. The C16:0 and
C18:0 FFAs in the wild-type strain reached only about 24.2 and 10.6
mg/L, respectively, and the increase in C16:0 and C18:0 FFAs in the
ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/ΔDGAI-acot strain compared with the wild-type
strain reached 244 and 247%, respectively.

results.

Efficient Synthesis of
Fatty Acid Derivatives Based on Enhanced
Supply of FFAs in ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4-car-sfp-Engineered Strain
On the basis of the enhanced supply of FFAs, the coexpression of
CAR and SFP successfully converted the individual FFAs into the corresponding
fatty alcohols while no fatty aldehydes were detected. In the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4-car-sfp-engineered strain, total fatty alcohols reached a concentration
of 24.3 mg/L and the fatty alcohols mainly detected included 1-tetradecanol
(C14:0 fatty alcohol), 1-hexadecanol (C16:0 fatty alcohol), cis-9-hexadecenol (C16:1 fatty alcohol), 1-octadecanol (C18:0
fatty alcohol), and cis-9-octadecenol (C18:1 fatty
alcohol) (Figure 3),
among which the cis-9-hexadecenol (C16:1) was found
to be the most abundant, accounting for approximately 40.7% of the
total fatty alcohols produced, followed by 1-hexadecanol (C16:0),
1-tetradecanol (C14:0), 1-octadecanol (C18:0), and cis-9-hexadecenol (C18:1), the concentrations of which accounted for
16.5, 11.4, 11.3, and 12.8%, respectively. Although detectable, 1-octanol
(C8:0 fatty alcohol), 1-decanol (C10:0 fatty alcohol), and 1-dodecanol
(C12:0 fatty alcohol) represented only less than 1.3, 3.1, and 2.7%
of the total fatty alcohols, respectively (Table 2), which was consistent
with the profile of the accumulated FFAs in the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4 double-deletion strain. Although the
CAR and SFP were also coexpressed in the wild-type strain, only extremely
small amounts of fatty alcohols were detected, including C16:0 fatty
alcohol of 0.76 mg/L and C18:0 fatty alcohol of 0.33 mg/L, indicating
the limited amount of FFAs produced in the wild-type strain.

From our study, it
was obvious that the CAR exhibited activity
toward FFAs with a broad range of chain length, from C8 to C18, and
the efficient conversion of FFAs to the fatty acid derivatives also
depended on the presence of SFP. The results herein were in accordance
with the previous report, in which the CAR was characterized and shown
to accept a broad range of aliphatic fatty acids.18 The SFP was necessary for the maximum activity of CAR,
and as a result, the coexpression of CAR and SFP in this study converted
the accumulated FFAs into fatty acid derivatives successfully.

Until now, the CAR has been exploited from limited sources such
as Mycobacterium marinum(18,21) and found to convert the FFAs to the corresponding aldehydes. However,
in this study, no fatty aldehydes were detected in the engineered
strain, but only fatty alcohols with different chain lengths were
accumulated. It was reported that S. cerevisiae contained various endogenous aldehyde reductases (ALRs),22 which could effectively convert the synthesized
fatty aldehydes into the corresponding fatty alcohols. As such, the
majority of FFAs were flux to the formation of fatty alcohols and
the trace amounts of fatty aldehydes generated were not detectable.

Enhanced Production of Fatty Alcohols in ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/ΔDGAI-acot-car-sfp-Engineered
Strain
Whereas the accumulated FFAs that resulted from the
engineered pathway were secreted into the culture broth, the rest
of the fatty acids were stored mainly in the form of TAGs and sterol
esters in S. cerevisiae. According
to our previous study, the acyl-CoA:DAGAT was the rate-limiting enzyme
involved in the synthesis of TAGs from fatty acyl-CoAs and its deletion
resulted in the release of fatty acyl-CoAs.15 In this study, the dgaI gene encoding the DAGAT
was codeleted with FAA1 and FAA4,
and the acyl-CoA thioesterase responsible for the conversion of fatty
acyl-CoAs to FFAs was introduced in the modified yeast strain, to
supply more FFAs for the production of fatty acid derivatives. For
ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/ΔDGAI-acot, because no “converting
enzymes” of car and sfp were
expressed, no fatty alcohols were detected. On the other hand, in
the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/ΔDGAI-acot-car-sfp strain, similar to the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4-car-sfp-engineered
strain, only fatty alcohols were detected and the profiles of the
fatty alcohols were in agreement with those in the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4-car-sfp strain (Figure 3). The concentration of total fatty alcohols increased from
24.3 to 31.2 mg/L, and that of the most abundant cis-9-hexadecenol (C16:1 fatty alcohol) reached 14.1 mg/L, an increase
of 42.7%. 1-Tetradecanol (C14:0 fatty alcohol), 1-hexadecanol (C16:0
fatty alcohol), 1-octadecanol (C18:0 fatty alcohol), and cis-9-octadecenol (C18:1 fatty alcohol) increased by 27.2, 19.8, 19.6,
and 19.2%, respectively (Table 3). For the medium-chain fatty alcohol including 1-octanol
(C8:0 fatty alcohol), 1-decanol (C10:0 fatty alcohol), and 1-dodecanol
(C12:0 fatty alcohol), no further increase in yield was observed.
In our previous study, the deletion of DAGAT resulted in no increase
in medium-chain fatty acyl-CoAs,15 and
as a result, no more medium-chain FFAs were further supplied for the
synthesis of fatty alcohols in this study. The production level of
fatty alcohol in the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/DGAI-car-sfp was also investigated. The deletion of DGAI was
previously demonstrated to accumulate fatty acyl-CoAs effectively.
However, without the expression of acyl-CoA thioesterase, the accumulated
fatty acyl-CoAs could not be efficiently converted to FFAs and thus
cannot be used as precursors for the CAR. As a result, no more fatty
alcohols were detected compared with ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4-car-sfp-engineered
strain.

significantly in the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/DGAI-acot-car-sfp-engineered strain, which accounted for only
26.2% of that produced in the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/DGAI-acot strain;
especially, the myristyl acid, cetyl acid, palmitoleyl acid, stearic
acid, and oleic acid decreased to 33, 37, 31, 43, and 43%, respectively
(Figure 4), demonstrating
the successful conversion of FFAs to fatty acid derivatives by the
coexpressed CAR and SFP.

Comparison of Production of Fatty Alcohols between Engineered
Strains Based on an Increased Supply of FFAs and Fatty Acyl-CoAs
In S. cerevisiae, both fatty acyl-CoAs
and FFAs are precursors of fatty acid derivatives, which can be directly
converted to the corresponding component either by enzymes using acyl-CoAs
as precursors such as FAR or by those with FFAs as precursors such
as CAR. Herein, the comparison of the production levels of fatty alcohols
between engineered strains based on an increased supply of FFAs (in
this study) and fatty acyl-CoAs (previous study) was performed. Both
the strategies resulted in the production of fatty alcohols without
forming fatty aldehydes, which was due to the substrate specificity
of FAR, belonging to the alcohol-forming type14 and the existence of endogenous ALRs in S. cerevisiae,22 converting the fatty aldehydes to
the corresponding fatty alcohols. The production level of fatty alcohols
in the two engineered strains was comparative, but interestingly,
in the engineered strain based on increased supply of fatty acyl-CoAs,
the mainly accumulated fatty alcohols were saturated fatty alcohols,
especially 1-hexadecanol (C16:0 fatty alcohol), accounting for approximately
80% of the total fatty alcohols. On the other hand, in the engineered
strain with increased supply of FFAs, the most abundant fatty alcohol
was unsaturated fatty alcohol, especially cis-9-hexadecenol
(C16:1 fatty alcohol), representing approximately 45% of the total
fatty alcohols. The cis-9-octadecenol (C18:1 fatty
alcohol) accounted for approximately 13% in the fatty acyl-CoA-accumulated
strain, but it was not detectable in the FFA-accumulated strain. In
addition, the medium-chain fatty alcohols with the carbon chain length
from C8 to C12 were not detected in the acyl-CoA-accumulated strain
but detectable in the FFA-accumulated strain.

While investigating
the fatty acid profile in the two engineered strains, it was found
that the deletion of FAA1 and FAA4 resulted in the accumulation of medium-chain FFAs including C8:0,
C10:0, and C12:0; unsaturated FFAs including C16:1 and C18:1; and
saturated FFAs including C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0 (Figure 2). Among them, the C16:1 and
C16:0 FFAs were found to be the most abundant and the medium-chain
FFAs accounted for only a small part of the total FFAs. As a result,
the expression of CAR with a broad substrate specificity resulted
in the production of fatty alcohols, the profile of which was in agreement
with that of the accumulated FFAs. In our previous study, the DGAI deletion strain resulted in no release of medium-chain
fatty acyl-CoAs from TAGs and the FAR was demonstrated to exhibit
the highest catalytic efficiency for C16:0 fatty acyl-CoA. As such,
the profiles of fatty alcohols produced between engineered strains
based on an increased supply of FFAs and fatty acyl-CoAs with expressed
CAR and FAR, respectively, reasonably differ from each other.

In the past few years, tremendous efforts have been focused on
the study of microbial production of fatty acids and their derivatives.
Similarly to our work, Runguphan and Keasling directly overexpressed
the FAR from Mus musculus to produce
fatty alcohols in S. cerevisiae and
followed by the replacement of strong constitutive promoter PTEF1 to the original promoter of genes involved in fatty acid
synthesis; the production level of fatty alcohol reached more than
90 mg/L.23 Zhou et al. engineered the yeast
strain step by step based on the increased supply of FFAs.24 The initial production of fatty alcohol reached
23.2 mg/L, which was comparable with our results. However, after the
deletion of genes involved in endogenous conversion of fatty alcohols
to fatty aldehyde and fatty acids, blocking the fatty acid degradation
pathway, and coexpression of FAR and CAR, the fatty alcohol yield
significantly increased. With further fed-batch strategies, the production
of fatty alcohol reached 1.5 g/L. The current results already demonstrated
the feasibility of the production of fatty acid derivatives based
on the two different strategies and by a further combination of other
strategies such as promoter replacement, by-pathway blockage, multiple
enzyme coexpression, and fermentation optimization, large-scale production
of fatty acid derivatives become realizable.

Conclusions
In this study, an alternative strategy to supply FFAs as precursors
for the synthesis of fatty acid derivatives was constructed. The codeletion
of FAA1 and FAA4 together with DGAI, followed by the integration of acyl-CoA thioesterase,
successfully enhanced the supply of FFAs with the carbon chain length
from C8 to C18. The coexpression of the CAR and SFP further converted
the accumulated FFAs into their corresponding fatty acid derivatives.
Because of the existence of endogenous ALRs in S. cerevisiae, the engineered strain mainly produced fatty alcohols but not fatty
aldehydes. The results obtained herein not only demonstrated the efficiency
of the constructed pathway for the production of fatty alcohol but
also solved the bottleneck involved in the utilization of fatty acids
as precursors for the synthesis of fatty acid derivatives directly.

Methods
Strains
and Cultivation
The S. cerevisiae BY4741 (ura3Δ, ΔMAT, his3Δ, leu2Δ, met15Δ)
was used as a parental strain in this study and cultivated in yeast
extract peptone dextrose (YPD) complete medium [1% yeast extract,
2% peptone, and 2% d-glucose (w/v)]. The engineered strains
harboring LEU2-based plasmids (pESC-leu) were selected
on agar plates of the yeast nitrogen base dextrose (YNBD) minimal
medium without leucine [6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base, 5 g/L ammonium
sulfate, 2% d-glucose (w/v), and 0.67 g/L leucine dropout
amino acid mixture]. The gene deletion strains with His5-based cassettes were selected on agar plates of YNBD minimal medium
plates without histidine [6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base, 5 g/L ammonium
sulfate, 2% d-glucose (w/v), and 0.65 g/L histidine dropout
amino acid mixture], and those with KanMX cassette
were selected on agar plates of YPD medium containing 200 mg/L Geneticin
(G418). All cultivations were performed at 30 °C and 200 rpm
(if necessary).

When cultivating the strains for the investigation
of fatty acid and fatty acid derivatives, single colonies were selected
from the corresponding agar plate. The wild-type strain and engineered
gene deletion strains with empty pESC plasmid or recombinant pESC
plasmids were cultivated overnight in 5 mL YNBD minimal medium without
leucine. After that, the seed liquid was inoculated into a 50 mL YNB
minimal medium without leucine, and 1% raffinose (w/v) together with
2% (w/v) galactose was added. The expression of target genes under
GAL1/GAL10 promoters was induced by the initial addition of galactose
in the absence of glucose at 30 °C and 200 rpm. The cell concentration
was measured according to the value of OD600, and after
the galactose induction for approximately 24 h and the cell growth
reached a stationary phase, the cells were centrifuged and collected
for further applications.

Construction of Engineered Strains
The ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4 double
gene disruption
strain was constructed according to the homologous recombination strategies:25 the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified
fragment containing the loxP-His5-loxP gene disruption
cassette and 45 nucleotide stretches that are homologous to the sequences
upstream of the start codon of FAA1 gene and downstream
of the stop codon were used for the homologous recombination of the FAA1 gene. The deletion of FAA4 gene was
based on the FAA1 single gene disruption strain,
and the generated PCR fragment containing the loxP-KanMX-loxP and 45 nucleotide stretches that are homologous to the sequences
upstream of the start codon of FAA4 gene and downstream
of the stop codon was used for the homologous recombination of the FAA4 gene. Once the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4 double gene disruption strain was obtained, the Kanr marker was rescued according
to the method described previously: The mutant strain was transformed
with the plasmid pSH47, which carries the cre recombinase
gene and URA3 marker gene. After growing in the YPD
medium, the cells were shifted to the YPG (galactose) medium to remove
the Kanr marker gene.
The colonies were detected on both YPD and replica-YPD plus G418 plate.
The marker-rescued mutant strain was further used for the deletion
of dgaI gene with the same strategy, and the Kanr marker was rescued again.

The carboxylic acid reductase gene (car) from M. marinum (accession no. WP_012393886) and 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene (sfp) from Bacillus subtilis (accession
no. Q9F4F7) were synthesized by GenScript and codon-optimized for S. cerevisiae. The two synthesized gene fragments
were flanked with a pair of SpeI/PacI and BamHI/XhoI restriction enzyme
sites, which were digested by the corresponding endonucleases and
inserted in the two multicloning sites of the predigested pESC-leu
plasmid. The recombinant plasmid and empty pESC-leu were then transformed
into the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4
mutant strain separately to construct the engineered strains ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4-pESC and ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4-car-sfp. The acyl-CoA thioesterase gene (acot) fragment from M. musculus (accession NM_145444.3) lacking the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting peptide was obtained
in our previous work and was inserted into the pMRI plasmid provided
by Prof. Yu26 between the NotI and BglII endonuclease sites. The pMRI recombinant
plasmid containing acot was then digested by sfiI endonuclease and transformed into the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/ΔDGAI deletion strain. The functional module was integrated into the HO
locus, generating the engineered strain ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/ΔDGAI-acot. The above-constructed pESC-car-sfp plasmid was then transformed into the ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/ΔDGAI-acot strain, resulting in ΔFAA1/ΔFAA4/ΔDGAI-acot-car-sfp. The primers
used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Metabolites Extraction and Derivatization
Cells (5
mL) growing in the corresponding culture medium at the stationary
phase were centrifuged and collected. After washing twice with distilled
water, the cells were resuspended in 400 μL of ethyl acetate,
and 5 μL of heptadecanoic acid (10 mg/mL) was added as internal
control. The cell samples were added with the same volume of glass
beads of diameter 425–600 μm and vortexed in a bead mill
with a vortex frequency of 4.0 m/s and a vortex time of 20 s for one
cycle. Ten cycles for each sample was performed to break the cells,
and the obtained cell lysis was centrifuged at room temperature at
10 000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants containing the extracted
metabolites were collected for derivatization.

For the derivatization
of fatty acids, 40 μL of N,O-bistrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1% chlorotrimethylsilane (TMCS)
was added to each of 60 μL samples and reacted at 70 °C
for 30 min. The reaction samples were then shaken at room temperature
for another 30 min and then transferred to vials for GC–MS
detection. Various concentrations of fatty alcohol standards with
carbon chain length from C8 to C18 were taken for the derivatization
following the same protocol and analyzed using GC–MS under
the same conditions. Quantitative calculation of fatty alcohols in
the samples was carried out according to the standard curve. Three
biological replicates were performed. For the derivatization of fatty
acids, the extracted metabolites were evaporated to dryness. Boron
trifluoride (BF3) solution (500 μL) with 14% methyl
alcohol (MeOH) was added into each of tubes containing the dried samples
and was reacted at 95 °C for 20 min. After that, 50 μL
of saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution was added to terminate
the reaction. n-Hexane solution (300 μL) was
then added, and the sample tubes were shaken at room temperature for
1 h. The n-hexane layer containing the derived fatty
acids (fatty acid methyl esters, FAMEs) was transferred to the vials
for GC–MS detection. Standard curves of the FAME standard mix
(with C8–C24 carbon chain length, Sigma) were used as references
for the quantitative calculation of FFAs in the extracted samples.
Three biological replicates were performed.

GC–MS Procedure
and Data Analysis
The GC–MS
system (Agilent 5975C) equipped with a DB-5 capillary column with
30 m length, 0.25 μm thickness, and 250 μm inner diameter
was used to analyze the samples. Samples measuring 1 μL were
injected into the GC–MS equipment and separated by the DB-5
capillary column in a splitless mode. The GC–MS program was
performed as follows: The temperature of the inlet and the MS source
was set at 250 and 230 °C, respectively. The initial temperature
of the oven was set at 80 °C, and then the gradient was increased
to 250 °C with a ramp of 7 °C/min. The carrier gas was helium,
and its flow rate was set at 1.0 mL/min. The chromatogram and identification
of mass spectra were acquired using the Shimadzu GC–MS solution
software. The final concentrations of the fatty acid derivatives and
the fatty acids were calculated with fatty alcohol standards and FAME
standards as references. All experiments were performed in three biological
replicates.
