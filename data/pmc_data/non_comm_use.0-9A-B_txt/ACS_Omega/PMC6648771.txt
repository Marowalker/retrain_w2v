We demonstrate the
synthesis of silicon carbide nanoparticles exhibiting
monolayer to few-layer graphene coatings and characterize their optical
response to confirm their plasmonic behavior. A multistep, low-temperature
plasma process is used to nucleate silicon particles, carbonize them
in-flight to give small silicon carbide nanocrystals, and coat them
in-flight with a graphene shell. These particles show surface plasmon
resonance in the infrared region. Tuning of the plasma parameters
allows control over the nanoparticle size and consequently over the
absorption peak position. A simplified equivalent dielectric permittivity
model shows excellent agreement with the experimental data. In addition,
optical characterization at high temperatures confirms the stability
of their optical properties, making this material attractive for a
broad range of applications.

Introduction
Ever since its initial
discovery, graphene has attracted tremendous
attention because of its unique electrical, thermal, and optoelectronic
properties.1 Graphene nanostructures have
been demonstrated in computational and experimental works to exhibit
surface plasmon resonance (SPR).2 This
behavior has important consequences from an application point of view
since graphene structures with tunable and controllable optical response
could find use in sensing,2c for the development
of photonic circuits,3 for thermophotovoltaic
devices,4 etc. While most of the research
in this area is based on lithographically patterned graphene placed
onto a flat surface, various attempts have been made to realize three-dimensional
graphene nanostructures. Graphene sheets have been wrapped around
metal oxide nanowires and nanoparticles to form hybrid structures
through a liquid-phase chemical process.5 Graphene has been grown on hexagonal-phase silicon carbide by high-temperature
annealing of silicon carbide micropowders.6 However, due to size effects on SPR of nanoparticles, significantly
smaller particles must be realized to harness SPR in the infrared
regime.7

In this work, we demonstrate
tunable infrared SPR in ceramic core,
graphene shell nanoparticles. To achieve that, we leverage the capabilities
of low-temperature (as referred to the gas temperature that remains
close to room temperature8), nonthermal
plasmas to produce particles with a relatively narrow size distribution,9 i.e., to avoid the formation of large particles
that would compromise the optical performance of the sample. Nanoparticles
are heated to temperatures considerably higher than the gas temperature
in these reactors because of exothermic reactions with plasma-produced
species (ions, radicals, metastables, etc.). This property has been
extensively investigated by many groups,10 and it is confirmed by recent reports on the nonthermal plasma synthesis
of graphitic particles11 and ceramic-like
carbides and nitrides.12 For the process
used for this study, silicon nanoparticles produced in a first nonthermal
plasma stage are rapidly carbonized by a second nonthermal plasma
into β-phase silicon carbide nanoparticles.13 By carefully controlling the carbon precursor concentration,
it is possible to tune between bare silicon carbide, single layer,
and few layers of graphene coating. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
measurements show a broad absorption feature in the infrared region
that we attribute to plasmon-induced resonance. This conclusion is
supported by the results of an “equivalent dielectric permittivity”
model that has been demonstrated to be in good agreement (<10%
error) to rigorous Mie Theory calculations for similar systems.2a FTIR measurements at temperatures as high as
650 °C show little dependence of the absorption cross section
on temperature, confirming that the material is highly thermally stable.

Results
and Discussion
The material discussed here was produced by
a nanoparticle synthesis
reactor very similar to the one previously reported by our group.13 It is comprised of two continuous flow capacitively
coupled nonthermal plasma reactors placed in series. A photograph
of the reactor is shown in Figure S1 of
the Supporting Information. Each of the plasma discharges is sustained
using a copper electrode wrapped around the quartz tube, which is
biased by a 13.56 MHz radio frequency power supply. One hundred standard
cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) of argon containing 1.37% silane
is flown through the primary plasma reactor to continuously nucleate
and grow silicon nanoparticles, which are then continuously carried
by the flow into the second plasma reactor. Following the primary
reactor, methane is added to the flow downstream of a 2 mm orifice
with flow rates ranging from 0.6 to 2 sccm. The silicon nanoparticles
are carbonized in the secondary plasma to form β-phase silicon
carbide nanoparticles and grow the graphitic shell. The particles
are then carried downstream of the reactor where they are collected
onto a fine stainless steel mesh acting as a filter. Figure 1a shows a transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) micrograph of the resulting core–shell β-SiC–graphene
nanoparticle. TEM was performed on a Tecnai T12 microscope. Fast Fourier
transform analysis of the image confirms that the particle core is
composed of silicon carbide, while a graphene monolayer surrounds
the particle core. Additional TEM images of samples produced under
various conditions are provided in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. While a detailed discussion of the
mechanism leading to the formation of the graphitic layer is not the
primary focus of this contribution, it is likely the result of a chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) process onto the nanoparticle surface. As already
mentioned, nanoparticles are heated to temperatures that significantly
exceed those of the background gas in these reactors. In addition,
the plasma-enhanced CVD growth of graphene has been experimentally
confirmed in several studies.14 The appearance
of a graphenelike shell that grows in thickness with increasing methane
concentration is consistent with a CVD mechanism. The pressure is
kept at either 3 or 6 Torr for the samples discussed in this contribution.
We have found that varying pressure is the simplest way of controlling
particle size due to changes in the residence time. The diameters
of 100 particles were measured from TEM micrographs to collect particle
size statistics. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 1b,c for the particles
produced at 3 and 6 Torr, respectively. Average particle diameters
were found to be 11.5 and 22 nm. There is no discernible change in
particle size as a function of methane flow.

Figure 1 (a) TEM micrograph of
a silicon carbide nanocrystal with a single
layer graphene shell. (b) and (c) Particle size distributions for
samples produced at 3 and 6 Torr, respectively.

Figure 2 shows
the
results of structural characterization. X-ray diffraction (XRD, performed
on a Panalytical Empyrean with a Cu Kα source) patterns are
shown in Figure 2a.
Some silicon is still present at the lower methane flow conditions,
although both Raman (performed on a Horiba LabRam with a 532 nm laser
excitation) in Figure 2b and TEM confirm the presence of graphitic carbon. This suggests
that while the majority of the silicon particles has been carbonized,
a flow of 0.6 sccm of methane is not sufficient to ensure that the
sample is structurally uniform. At higher methane flows, there is
practically no residual silicon at the reactor outlet. Raman indicates
the presence of two clear peaks present at around 1350 and 1580 cm–1, corresponding to the D and G bands of carbon. The
D/G peak intensity ratio ranges from 1.9:1 to 3:1, indicating a mixture
of disordered and graphitic material.15 However, there is no significant peak present at the two-dimensional
position at around 2700 cm–1, which correlates to
the presence of graphene.16 These Raman
spectra are clearly different from those observed for large graphene
flakes. This difference is justified by the presence of defects in
the graphene coating. For instance, the coating does not appear to
be uniform and continuous around the SiC core in Figure 1a. Figure S2 also clearly shows the presence of exposed edges and blisters.
While further work is necessary to understand how to improve the quality
of the graphene coating, the material described in this report has
sufficiently high quality to show plasmonic behavior.

Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns for
samples produced at 3 Torr, with increasing
amounts of methane flown through the system. The diffraction patterns
for samples produced at 6 Torr show a similar trend and are not shown
for brevity. (b) Raman spectra for samples produced at 3 and 6 Torr,
with increasing amounts of methane flown through the system.

FTIR spectra have been measured
with a Nicolet iS50 by drop-casting
a dispersion of particles, ultrasonicated in chloroform, onto a ZnSe
ATR window. Results of FTIR are summarized in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows the spectra for the particles produced at 3
Torr, whereas Figure 3b shows those for the particles produced at 6 Torr. All of the spectra
are normalized to the peak at 860 cm–1, corresponding
to the vibrational mode of Si–C,17 to account for differences in the amount of drop-casted material.
The samples exhibit distinct broad absorption features. At the higher
pressure condition (i.e., larger particles), this peak position redshifts
considerably from ∼5000 cm–1 (2 μm,
0.62 eV) to ∼3000 cm–1 (3.3 μm, 0.375
eV). With the increasing methane flow, the peak initially increases
in magnitude and then drops considerably and redshifts to lower energies.

Figure 3 (a) FTIR
spectra for the samples produced at 3 Torr, with a varying
amount of methane. The calculated absorption spectra shown good agreement
with respect to the peak position. Accounting for the dispersion in
particle sizes (labeled as “Hi mob—PSD”) and
for an increase in plasmon dephasing rate due to defects (“low
mobility”) is not sufficient to reproduce the measured absorption
spectra. Both these effects are accounted for to obtain a good fit
between the experimental data and the calculated results. (b) Same
as (a) but for samples produced at 6 Torr.

A modified version of the equivalent dielectric permittivity
model
developed by Shi et al.2a is used to theoretically
reproduce the broad features shown in the spectra in Figure 3. The nanoparticle core has
a radius rSiC and graphene shell thickness tg. Although a monolayer of graphene measures
0.34 nm in thickness, the value here is taken to be 1 nm in following
with preceding computational works on optical conductivity of graphene.
This accounts for inhomogeneity in the growth of graphene.2a,18 The dielectric constant of graphene is calculated from the optical
conductivity relation 1  where ε∥ is the in-plane
dielectric constant of graphene, ε⊥ is the
out-of-plane dielectric constant of graphene (set to the value of
graphite, 2.5), ω is the excitation light frequency, and εo is the vacuum dielectric permittivity constant. tg is the graphene shell thickness, as stated earlier.
The optical conductivity of graphene is calculated from the random
phase approximation with the local limit condition based on the Kubo
formalism19 2   3   4  where σintra and σinter are the intraband and interband conductivities, respectively, e is the elementary electron charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, ℏ is the reduced Planck
constant, T is the room temperature (300 K), Ef is the Fermi level of graphene (taken to be
1 eV, ba sed on the discu ssion in ref (2a)), and τg is the carrier relaxation
time. Since the nanoparticles are much smaller than the wavelengths
under consideration (1–10 μm), the core–shell
particles can be treated as an isotropic homogeneous medium with an
effective dielectric constant, εnp, obtained as 5  where f is the volume fraction
of graphene, εSiC is the dielectric constant of the
silicon carbide core, taken to be 6.52,20 and εeq-G is the equivalent dielectric constant
of the graphene shell. Given the spherical symmetry of the shell,
the perpendicular ε⊥ (out-of-plane) and the
two parallel ε∥ (in-plane) components of graphene’s
dielectric constant equally contribute to the equivalent dielectric
constant of the shell 6  The absorption, scattering, and extinction
cross sections can then be calculated by2b 7   8   9  where k is the wave vector
of the incident light and εc is the permittivity
of the environment, taken as unity for air. R is
the particle radius. The absorption spectrum for the case of particles
with sizes equivalent to the ensemble average size, and with a mobility
of 10 000 cm2/(V s) corresponding to the bulk value
for graphene, is shown in Figure 3a, labeled as “high mobility”. While
the peak position matches quite well with the measured one, both the
width of the particle size distribution and an increased carrier relaxation
frequency need to be included to reproduce the measured peak shape.
The synthesized SiC particles do not have a monodispersed particle
size distribution, as shown
in Figure 1b,c. This
is easily accounted for by convoluting the single-size theoretical
spectrum over the Gaussian fit of the measured particle size distribution.
The resulting absorption spectra are labeled as “High mob –
PSD” in Figure 3a,b. While this increases the width of the theoretical extinction
spectrum, it is not sufficient to reproduce the measured data. An
additional reduction in electron mobility from the bulk value of 10 000
cm2/(V s) to 1000 cm2/(V s) gives an excellent
agreement between the theoretical and the measured absorption peak
shapes. The use of a reduced mobility is justified by both TEM and
Raman characterizations (Figures 1a and 2b), which confirm the
less-than-perfect structure of the coating. The model predicts a shift
in peak position that is also in excellent agreement with the measurement,
as shown in Figure 3b.

The dependence of the absorption spectra on the methane
flow deserves
further comment. At each pressure, the peak intensity initially increases
with methane flow, with no change in peak position. Then, as methane
is further increased, the peak intensity drops drastically and the
position redshifts significantly. This behavior is consistent with
the observation of residual silicon in the samples carbonized with
the smallest amount of methane. This explains the increase in the
intensity of the plasmon peak when methane is increased to 1 sccm,
i.e., the fraction of fully carbonized particles with a graphene shell
is higher in this sample. Additional increase of the methane flow
induces growth in the layer thickness and appearance of defects, as
shown in Figure S2. This is accompanied
by a red shift in plasmon energy and by a broadening in the absorption
feature. This is consistent with a significant increase in the scattering
and plasmon dephasing rates in these samples.

These results
suggest that improvements with respect to both the
particle size distribution and quality of the graphene layer will
help achieving a sharper plasmon resonance feature in the absorption
spectrum. We believe that this is attainable by further engineering
of the plasma reactor. These efforts go beyond the scope of this manuscript,
which provides the first experimental evidence of tunable plasmon
resonance in graphene by its direct growth onto sufficiently small
nanoparticles. The nanopowder format is advantageous for various applications
since it is inherently compatible with well-established coating techniques
and with top-down manufacturing schemes. Its thermal stability is
also among its advantages. The area of refractory plasmonics aims
at overcoming the limitations of small metallic particles with respect
to compatibility with high-temperature environments and has recently
attracted significant interest of the community.21 In Figure 4a, we show the temperature dependence of the absorption for particles
produced at 3 Torr with 1 sccm of methane flow, corresponding to the
“Mid CH4 (1 sccm)” spectrum in Figure 3a. The absorption has been measured at temperatures
as high as 650 °C. These measurements have been performed in
diffuse reflectance mode under an argon atmosphere using the Praying
Mantis tool from Harrick Scientific Products Inc. We do not observe
any major change in the spectra, confirming the stability of the material
and its potential for the many applications that require operation
at high temperatures.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated
the synthesis of silicon carbide nanoparticles
exhibiting graphitic coatings with reproducible and tunable SPR absorption.
A low-temperature plasma process is used to continuously and rapidly
convert silane and methane into a core–shell plasmonic structure.
The tunability of the absorption peak intensity was investigated and
found to agree with calculations done by the equivalent dielectric
permittivity model. The broadening of the absorption features compared
to previous computational works arises from the lowered electron mobility
and the width of the particle size distribution. The nanoparticle
format makes this material particularly promising from the point of
view of handling and ease of integration into functional structures.
In particular, their thermal stability makes them, in our opinion,
particularly interesting for application in high-temperature environments.
