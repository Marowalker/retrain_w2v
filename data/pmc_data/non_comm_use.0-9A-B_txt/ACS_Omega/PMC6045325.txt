Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are
promising novel cancer biomarkers.
However, rapid and easy analysis of EVs is challenging because conventional
detection methods require large sample volumes and long detection
times. Microchip-based analytical systems have particularly attracted
attention for development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. Previously,
various biomarker detection methods on a portable power-free poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) microchip using laminar flow-assisted dendritic amplification
have been developed. Recently, for easy functionalization, we proposed
a microchannel inner surface-functionalized power-free PDMS microchip
(SF-PF microchip) utilizing electron beam-induced graft polymerization.
In this study, we apply the technique and prepare a novel SF-PF microchip.
On the microchip, EVs were successfully detected. The required sample
volume was 1.0 μL, and the total analysis time was 20 min. The
microchip can contribute to EV-based POC cancer diagnosis.

Introduction
Early disease detection
plays a vital role in effective treatment.
To detect diseases via minimally invasive procedures, various biomarkers
in liquid biopsies have been utilized. In the case of cancer, biomolecules
such as proteins,1,2 circulating cell-free DNAs,3 and microRNAs4 have
been reported as biomarkers. In many biomarkers, extracellular vesicles
(EVs) have emerged as promising novel biomarkers of diseases, especially
in pancreatic cancer, because of their high sensitivity and specificity
of detection.5

EVs, including exosomes
and microvesicles, are small membranous
particles originating from cells. Some EVs such as exosomes6,7 are secreted from inside the cell by exocytosis, and others such
as extosomes8 and oncosomes,9 which are categorized as microvesicles, are directly
budded from the cell membrane. They exist in body fluids such as saliva,
blood, and urine. One of the roles of EVs in biological mechanisms
as a cell-to-cell communication tool was revealed in 2007,10 and EVs have since then attracted much attention.
Roles of the EVs have been investigated for cancer,11 immune response,7 and development.12 As for cancers, reciprocal signals between cancer
cells and the surrounding cells mediated by EVs are involved in cancer
cell survival, metastasis,9,13 and the promotion of
invasion, angiogenesis, and drug resistance.11,14 Because EVs carry molecular information about the origin cells,15,16 capturing this information could be useful in clinical cancer research.
In addition to the existence of cancer-specific EVs,5 the size of the EVs could be information.17 Furthermore, the diagnostic biomarker potential of EVs
has also been reported not only in cancers but also in diseases such
as hepatitis C,18 multiple sclerosis,19 and malaria.20 Currently,
EVs are expected to be a promising low-invasive biomarker.

However,
rapid and easy analysis of EVs is challenging, and hence
conventional detection methods, such as ultracentrifugation, western
blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, require large sample
volumes and long detection times.15 At
the laboratory level, several EV detection methods have been reported,21−23 for example, ExoScreen, which is a bead-based EV detection method,
requires 5 μL of sample and 1.5 h.24 To achieve the early detection of cancer, point-of-care (POC) diagnosis
is a promising method. For POC diagnosis, microchip-based analytical
systems have attracted attention because of their cost-effectiveness,
that is, small sample sizes with short analysis times. Various biomarker
detection methods on a power-free poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchip25 using laminar flow-assisted dendritic amplification
(LFDA)26 have been developed27,28 by Hosokawa et al. The power-free sequential injection was based
on the high gas solubility of PDMS. Briefly, after PDMS is degassed
in a vacuum chamber, air redissolves into PDMS at atmospheric pressure.
The redissolution of the air in the closed microchannels provides
negative pressure and enables power-free sample injection into the
microchannels. In addition, the sequential injection is achievable
because the first solution retains by capillary force at the inlet
and second and third solutions restart the following injection without
invasion of bubbles in the microchannels. The power-free technique
eliminates the need for an external power source to supply the sample
solution into the microchannels and makes the microchip portable.

Recently, we proposed a surface-functionalized power-free PDMS
microchip (SF-PF microchip)29 as a novel
platform for analysis, in which the inner surface of the microchip
was chemically modified by electron beam-induced graft polymerization
(EIGP). The portable SF-PF microchip enables rapid analyte detection
from small sample volume. We selected EIGP in various surface modification
methods of PDMS microchannels30 because
it provides stable covalent modification and easily functionalizable
surfaces. In our previous study, we confirmed that poly(glycidyl methacrylate)
(PGMA)-grafted PDMS could be preserved for over 1 year and the power-free
ability was retained even after surface functionalization.29 As the microchip can be easily functionalized
with appropriate ligands at desired times, it can also be used for
various applications. In this study, we immobilized antibodies on
the inner surface of the microchannel to capture EVs and prepared
a novel SF-PF microchip that enables rapid and easy EV detection.
The proposed SF-PF microchip-based EV detection method would contribute
to development of EV research and establishment of novel POC diagnosis.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of the Prepared Microchip
and Isolated EVs
For glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) polymerization,
a dose of 20 kGy
was selected for reducing autofluorescence noise during EV detection
and 3.0 M GMA was used in the feed for grafting to obtain the maximum
amount of grafted PGMA on the inner surface of the microchannels on
the microchip, as discussed in detail elsewhere.29 Immobilization of anti-CD63 antibody on the inner surface
of the microchannels was confirmed by adsorption of fluorescently
labeled secondary antibodies (Figure 1). The size distribution of isolated EVs from the supernatant
of MCF7, which was obtained by NanoSight, is shown in Figure 2. As the size of the isolated
EVs was approximately 30–100 nm, the nanoparticles were categorized31 as exosomes,6 which
are secreted from inside the cell by exocytosis, or ectosomes,8 which are directly budded from the cell membrane.
The concentration was 4.6 × 109 EVs/μL PBS.

cells.

EV Detection on the SF-PF
Microchip
Typical fluorescent
images of EV detection on the SF-PF microchip are shown in Figure 3a. On the anti-CD63
antibody-immobilized microchip, with increasing amplification time,
a bright line appeared only on the border between the amplification
reagents in the left microchannel in which the target EV-containing
solution (4.6 × 109 EVs/μL PBS) had been injected.
On the other hand, the bright line did not appear even after 4 min
in the microchannels in which blank solutions had been injected from
both inlets. On the normal mouse IgG-immobilized microchip instead
of that immobilized with anti-CD63 antibody, the bright line also
did not appear after 4 min in the microchannels in which the EV-containing
solution was injected from the left inlet and blank solution was injected
from the right inlet. The statistical evaluations of the fluorescent
signals are shown in Figure 3b. The differences in the signal-to-blank ratio between EV–blank
and blank–blank on the anti-CD63 antibody-immobilized microchip
and between EV–blank on the anti-CD63 antibody-immobilized
microchip and EV–blank on the normal mouse IgG-immobilized
microchip were statistically significant at p <
0.05 and 0.01, respectively. The differences in the signal-to-blank
ratios between EV–blank on the normal mouse IgG-immobilized
microchip and blank–blank on both anti-CD63 antibody-immobilized
and normal mouse IgG-immobilized microchips were not statistically
significant. In addition, the differences in the signal-to-blank ratios
between EV–blank and blank–blank on anti-CD63 antibody-impregnated
bare PDMS microchips were not statistically significant (Figure S1). The EV concentration detected in
this study was between 10 and 100 times higher than that in body fluids.32 Therefore, further study of the sensitivity
improvement is needed prior to use in practical applications. The
required sample volume was 1.0 μL, and the total analysis time
was 20 min. In conclusion, EVs were easily, rapidly, and specifically
detected on the portable SF-PF microchip.

Conclusions
EVs
are promising cancer biomarkers because they carry molecular
information of the origin cells. In this study, we proposed a simple
inner surface modification method utilizing EIGP and applied the method
to a power-free microchip. The SF-PF microchip demonstrated selective
EV detection from a 1.0 μL sample solution within 20 min. Because
previous EV detection methods take more than several hours and require
more complicated operations, the SF-PF microchip-based rapid and easy
EV detection method is superior. Although the SF-PF microchip is promising
for EV-based diagnosis, improvements in sensitivity are required for
practical applications. Protocol optimization, the rational design
of the microchannels to enhance the contact efficiency between the
target EVs and the functionalized microchannel inner surfaces, and
partial grafting33 to avoid the consumption
of EVs are possible solutions. Further study is urgently needed, which
would contribute to a better understanding of EVs in biology and help
to establish POC cancer diagnosis.

Materials and Methods
Preparation
of a Surface-Functionalized Power-Free (SF-PF) Microchip
for EV Detection
The SF-PF microchip was prepared as follows.
First, PDMS (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning, Midland, MI) with a pair of
Y-shaped microchannels (100 μm in width, 25 μm in height)
was fabricated by soft lithography, as described previously.34 The left and right Y-shaped microchannels are
for the detection of the target EV and a blank reference, respectively.
Then, PGMA was grafted onto the inner surface of the microchannels
by EIGP (Figure 4),
as described previously.29 Briefly, the
microchannels of the PDMS microchip were filled with 3.0 M GMA monomer
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) in N,N-dimethylformamide solution and the microchip was set in
a gas-barrier bag (Lamizip; AS ONE Corp., Japan) with an oxygen scavenger
(Ageless; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co., Japan). The microchip was then
irradiated with a 20 kGy electron beam. After washing with methanol,
a PGMA-grafted PDMS microchip was obtained. Next, human anti-CD63
antibody was immobilized onto the inner surface of the grafted microchip.
Microchannels were filled with 1 mg/L anti-CD63 antibody (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) in carbonate buffer solution and incubated at 310 K for
2 h. The amount of anti-CD63 antibody immobilized was evaluated using
the fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Finally, the antibody-immobilized
PDMS microchip was degassed at 10 kPa for 1 h and a SF-PF microchip
for EV detection was obtained.

EV Isolation
According to a standard protocol for the
isolation of EVs,35 EVs were purified from
conditioned medium of the breast cancer cell line, MCF7, by differential
ultracentrifugation. MCF7 cells were cultured in 10 mL of RPMI-1640
(Wako) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cansera International,
Inc., Ontario, Canada), nonessential amino acids (Wako), penicillin
(31 μg/mL, Sigma), and streptomycin (50 μg/mL, Sigma)
in 100 mm dishes. The MCF7 cells (3 × 106) were passaged
into eight dishes and cultured for 1 week. The supernatant (80 mL)
was then harvested and centrifuged at 300g at 277
K for 10 min to remove the cells, at 2000g at 277
K for 20 min to remove the dead cells, and at 10 000g at 277 K for 45 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant
was ultracentrifuged to obtain an EV pellet at 110 000g at 277 K for 80 min. The pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and ultracentrifuged again. The pellet was resuspended
in approximately 200 μL of PBS. The size distribution and concentration
of the EVs were determined by NanoSight (NanoSight, Ltd., Wiltshire,
SP4 7RT, U.K.) nanoparticle tracking analysis.

EV Detection
The
isolated EVs were detected on the
SF-PF microchip. A schematic and protocol of EV detection are shown
in Figures 5 and S2. Blocking buffer (1% Roche Blocking Reagent,
0.02% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5× saline sodium citrate, and
0.05% Tween 20, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was injected into the microchannel
for 3 min. Subsequently, 1.0 μL of the target EV-containing
PBS solution and 1.0 μL of biotinylated 10 nM anti-CD63 antibody
in PBS were injected into the microchannel for 5 min to obtain the
antibody–EV–antibody complex. Finally, the fluorescence
signal was amplified by LFDA.26 Two amplification
reagents, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (“FITC-SA”,
5.0 μg/mL, Figure 5) and biotinylated anti-streptavidin (“Biotin-anti-SA”,
20 μg/mL, Figure 5), were injected into the microchannel. The solutions were injected
into the grafted microfluidic device by power-free sequential injection,
as described in detail elsewhere.36 The
fluorescence intensities were quantified using the ImageJ software
(version 1.45s, National Institute of Health, MD). The specificity
of the SF-PF microchip to EVs was confirmed using normal mouse IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)-immobilized PF microchip
instead of anti-CD63 antibody. The necessity of the graft polymer
on the inner surface of the microchip was confirmed using an anti-CD63
antibody-impregnated bare PDMS microchip. The statistical significance
of fluorescent signal intensities was assessed by the two-tailed t test.
