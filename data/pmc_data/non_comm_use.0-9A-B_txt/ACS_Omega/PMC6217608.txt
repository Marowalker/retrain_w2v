Fluorescent
carbon dots (FCDs) have received considerable attention
because of the great potential for a wide range of applications, from
bioimaging to optoelectronic devices. In this work, we reported the
synthesis of nitrogen-doped FCDs with an average size of 2 nm in a
subcritical water apparatus by using biomass waste (i.e., expired
milk) as the precursor. The obtained FCDs were highly dispersed in
aqueous solution because of the presence of O-containing functional
groups on their surfaces. Under the excitation of ultraviolet and
blue light, the FCDs exhibited excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence
in the emission range of 400–550 nm. The FCDs could be easily
taken up by HeLa cells without additional surface functionalization,
serving as fluorescent nanoprobes for bioimaging. The applications
of FCDs as sensing agents for the detection of Fe3+, solid-state
fluorescent patterning, and transparent hybrid films were also performed,
demonstrating their potential for solid-state fluorescent sensing,
security labeling, and wearable optoelectronics.

Introduction
Fluorescent nanomaterials
have received intense scientific attention
and offer promising applications from molecular sensors through cancer
diagnosis agents to optoelectronic devices.1−4 Fluorescent carbon dots (FCDs),
also known as carbon quantum dots or carbon nanodots, are among the
most attractive of fluorescent nanomaterials, offering low cytotoxicity,
favorable biocompatibility, and high photostability.5−8 Consequently, a variety of synthetic strategies for FCDs have been
developed, which can be classified into top-down and bottom-up approaches.9−11 The top-down approach involves the cleavage of carbonaceous materials
via acidic oxidation, hydrothermal treatment, or electrochemical exfoliation
of carbon materials, such as graphite, graphene, carbon nanotubes,
and carbon black.12−14 However, the top-down approach requires expensive
machines and high energy consumption, which limited the scale-up production
of FCDs.15 Alternatively, the bottom-up
approach for the synthesis of FCDs is based on solution chemistry,
cyclodehydrogenation of polyphenylene precursors, or carbonization
of certain polymers.16 In particular, the
use of biomass as precursors for the preparation of FCDs has attracted
much attention as an effective method for the mass production of FCDs
because of the low cost and ease of scale-up.17−21

Milk as one of the most popular sources of
nutrition for human
beings is an emulsion or colloid of butterfat globules containing
carbohydrates and proteins in general.22 Millions of tons of milk are produced everyday throughout the world,
and people are always willing to drink fresh milk than that past the
sell-by date in most countries. Therefore, retailers and consumers
discard billions of dollars of unspoiled milk each year while relying
on inaccurate printed expiration dates. Along with others, we have
found that milk can be used as a mutual precursor of carbon and nitrogen
for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped FCDs,23−25 which offers
an effective way to turn waste into wealth. However, the previous
reported microwave-assisted approaches or hydrothermal methods suffer
from multiple disadvantages for scale-up,26 including high energy consumption of the microwave process and high
cost of the Teflon-lined autoclaves that are used as reactors. The
high-pressure reactors widely used in the supercritical/subcritical
fluid technique can generate subcritical water (SBCW) referring to
liquid water, with pressure in the temperature range of 373.15–647.15
K,27 which provides a good reaction condition
for FCD synthesis from milk in theory. The uses of the SBCW apparatus
in various fields such as chemical reaction, extraction, and material
processing have been realized in laboratory scale and even in large-scale
industrial applications.28−30 However, as far as we are aware,
few studies have been focused on the synthesis of FCDs in SBCW apparatuses.

In this work, we reported the preparation of FCDs using milk (3
days overdue) as the carbon precursor in SBCW. The obtained FCDs showed
an average size of 2 nm, with a large amount of functional groups
such as −COOH and −OH, and N-containing groups, which
made them well-dispersed in aqueous solution. The optical characterization
showed that the FCDs exhibited an excitation wavelength-dependent
emission in the wavelength range of 400–550 nm. Compared with
the commonly used hydrothermal or microwave-assisted synthesis methods,
the methodology developed in the present study has the following advantages:
(1) it offers a means to use one facility’s waste (expired
milk) as another’s input, thereby reducing the raw materials
required and waste generated; (2) the reaction process developed in
the SBCW apparatus is more convenient for real-time monitoring of
the temperature and pressure in the reaction system and more reliable
for scalable mass production; (3) the newly developed FCDs show important
potential in many application areas such as solid-state fluorescent
sensing, security labeling, and wearable optoelectronics. We also
demonstrated the applications of the obtained FCDs in the fluorescence
sensing of Fe3+ and as fluorescent inks for patterning.
Further, this paper also presented an easy and effective method for
synthesizing FCDs/SiO2 nanocomposites to prevent the self-quenching
of FCDs in solid state.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of FCDs
The expired
milk was pumped into the microreactor (MR) of the SBCW apparatus,
as shown in Figure 1. The nitrogenous proteins in the milk were then transformed into
FCDs during the hydrothermal treatment in SBCW. The use of biomass
waste (i.e., expired milk) as the nitrogen and carbon precursor offered
a means to use one facility’s waste as another’s input,
thereby reducing the raw materials required and waste generated. Compared
with the conventional Teflon-lined autoclaves used for the hydrothermal
synthesis of FCDs, the SBCW apparatuses with a temperature probe and
pressure controller are more convenient for real-time monitoring and
controlling of the temperature and pressure in the reaction system.
In addition, by coupling with a freeze-drying equipment, the yield
of FCDs could be largely improved. Therefore, the newly developed
synthesis method is more suitable for mass production and industrial
applications.

freeze dryer.

Figure 2 illustrates
the possible process for the formation of FCDs from milk in SBCW.
The proteins in the solution were folded within three-dimensional
domains in the precursor. When the temperature of the solution grew
up, protein denaturation occurred.31 The
amino acids were unraveled, followed by the hydrolysis of proteins
over 60 °C in the SBCW apparatus.32 The reactions between the amine group compounds and carboxides in
the solution then occurred, similar to the Maillard reaction, forming
polymer-like dots.33 The formation of nanosized
spherical FCDs was attributed to the self-assembly of the polymer-like
dots. The powder of FCDs can be easily obtained by freeze-drying treatment.

Figure 2 Schematic
diagram for the route to FCDs from milk by the hydrolysis
of protein and subsequent Maillard reaction in SBCW.

Figure 3a shows
the subgram-scale (768.4 mg) quantities of dried FCD powders in one
batch in our experiments (Figure S1). The
FCDs could be easily dispersed in aqueous solution (Figure S2). Figure 3b shows a typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
of the obtained FCDs. The FCDs exhibited a spherical shape and were
highly monodispersed with no significant aggregates observed. The
diameters of the FCDs were less than 5 nm, with uniform size distributions.
The corresponding nanoparticle size distribution histogram was obtained
by counting about 150 FCDs (the inset of Figure 3b). The crystallinity of the FCDs was evaluated
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Figure S3), from which a broad peak of ultrasmall carbon dots was
observed. To study the components and structures of the FCDs, both
the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were then examined. The FTIR spectrum in Figure 3c reveals the characteristic
absorption bands of the O–H and N–H stretching vibrations
in the region of 3020–3700 cm–1, along with
the characteristic band of C–H stretching vibration at 2940
cm–1. The C=O and C=C stretching vibrations
were recorded at 1680 and 1597 cm–1, whereas the
C–N stretching vibration was found at 1400 cm–1. The broad band around 1070 cm–1 was attributed
to the C–O bending vibration.34 The
XPS full survey spectrum presented in Figure 3d shows three typical peaks: C 1s (285 eV),
N 1s (400 eV), and O 1s (532 eV), which indicate that the FCDs composed
of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. In the high-resolution spectra (Figure 3e,f), the C 1s band
can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 284.7, 286.1, 287.6, and 288.7
eV, corresponding to the C 1s states in C–C/C=C, C–N/C–O,
C=O, and COOH, respectively. The N 1s spectrum exhibits two
peaks at 399.6 and 401.2 eV, representing pyrrolic N and graphite
N. The O 1s band in Figure S4 contains
two peaks at 531.3 and 532.4 eV for C=O and C–O, respectively.35 These results demonstrated the presence of abundant
functional groups like −COOH and −OH, and N-containing
groups, in the milk-derived FCDs, enabling them to be well-dispersed
in aqueous solution for various applications.

The UV–visible absorption spectrum of the
aqueous dispersion
of FCDs (Figure 4a)
shows a sharp absorbance peak at 280 nm, which is attributed to the
aromatic π orbital electron transition of the nanocarbon structure.36Figure 4a also shows the FCDs obtained by expired milk exhibiting
a high fluorescence emission band at 440 nm when it was excited by
360 nm, the fluorescence intensity of which is comparable with that
of normal milk (Figure S5). Upon irradiation
with a 365 nm UV light, the FCDs can generate a blue color (Figure 4a inset). These prepared
FCDs have an excitation-dependent emission property, as shown in Figure 4b, that the emission
peaks shift to a longer wavelength with the increase of the excitation
wavelength, and this phenomenon may be caused by the optical selection
of different defect states on the surface of CDs.37 We also noticed that the fluorescence quantum yield (QY)
of carbon dots is 8.64%, and this value is higher than that of some
of the previously reported carbon dots which use biomass as the precursor.38−41 In addition, to explore the effect of temperature on the fluorescence
behavior, the FCDs were examined at different temperatures (0, 30,
and 60 °C). Figure 4c shows the result that the lower the temperature, the stronger is
the fluorescence intensity in a certain temperature range.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity
To ensure the potential of the
FCDs for biorelated applications, the cytotoxicity of the FCDs was
investigated toward HeLa cells and mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem
cells (BMSCs) P2 by a typical CCK-8 assay. Figure 5a shows the relative cell viability of HeLa
cells treated with different concentrations of the FCDs. We can see
that no significant cytotoxicity of cells was caused by the FCDs,
even at high concentrations of 300 μg/mL. Further, Figure 5b shows the relative
cell viability for the mouse BMSCs P2 treated with the synthesized
FCDs at different concentrations for 0, 12, 24, and 48 h. We can see
that after 48 h, the cells still have high cell viability, even at
high concentrations of 400 μg/mL, which confirms that the FCDs
are cytocompatible and do not induce cell death.

assay of (a) HeLa cells incubated with
different concentrations of the FCDs for 6 h and (b) mouse BMSCs P2
treated with the synthesized FCDs at different concentrations for
0, 12, 24, and 48 h.

In Vitro Cell Imaging
Taking advantage of the scalable
synthesis approach and the desired optical property, we then demonstrated
the as-prepared FCDs to be a promising nanoprobe for fluorescent cellular
imaging. Figure 6a,b
shows the images of control cells (without FCD treatment) and experimental
cells (incubated with 200 μg/mL of FCDs for 6 h). According
to the bright-field images, the morphologies of both control cells
and experimental cells were kept very well, indicating the FCDs did
not cause significant toxicity to the cells. The fluorescence images
illustrated that the two-photon excited fluorescence of FCDs could
be clearly observed from the cytoplasm of the cells. As the cells
were irradiated by a 780 nm femtosecond laser for fluorescence imaging,
no autofluorescence of the cells was detected. These results demonstrated
the efficient uptake of FCDs by HeLa cells, making them promising
candidates as cellular imaging agents and drug carriers in biomedical
research.

cells without FCD treatment and (b) cells incubated with 200 μg/mL

Fluorescent Sensing of
Fe3+
Interestingly,
we can see the fluorescence quench obviously upon the addition of
2 mM Fe3+ in Figure 7a, and the inner filter effect of Fe3+ for the
fluorescent quenching of FCDs was excluded (Figure S6). The quenching efficiency was calculated to be about 76.57%.
From recent reports, the existence of abundant oxygen-containing functional
groups on the surface of FCDs might be the reason for the FCDs to
be able to detect Fe3+.42,43 The UV–visible
absorption spectrum in Figure 7b shows that FCDs exhibit an obvious absorption band at 280
nm and that the Fe3+ aqueous solution displays a strong
absorption at 290 nm. When 2 mM Fe3+ was added into the
FCDs, the absorption peak of FCDs increased evidently, and Fe3+ disappeared. Further, comparing the experiment-determined
UV absorption of the FCD/Fe3+ solution (black line in Figure 7b) with the sum of
individual absorptions from FCDs and Fe3+ (pink line in Figure 7b) at the same concentrations,
it was observed that they were not similar, which indicated that the
reaction happened between the FCDs and Fe3+ to form the
FCDs/Fe3+ complex.

Figure 7 (a) Fluorescence emission spectra of the FCDs,
Fe3+,
and FCDs + Fe3+ (λex = 360 nm). (b) UV–visible
absorption spectra of the FCDs, Fe3+, and FCDs + Fe3+.

As shown in Figure 8a,b, the results display the excellent sensitivity
of the detection
of Fe3+. The fluorescence intensity of FCDs obviously quenched
with the increase of the concentration of Fe3+ from 0.0
to 2.0 mM. In addition, a good linear correlation is found between
the fluorescence quenching efficiency (F0/F) of FCDs and the Fe3+ concentration
in the range of 0.5–1.4 mM. The concentration of Fe3+ can be calculated by the following equation 1  where F0 and F correspond
to the fluorescence intensities of FCDs before
or after adding Fe3+, respectively, and C represents the concentration of Fe3+.

Figure 8 (a) Fluorescence emission
spectra of the FCDs with different concentrations
of Fe3+ (λex = 360 nm). (b) Linear correlation
of (F0/F) vs the Fe3+ concentration in the range of 0.5–1.4 mM. (c) Fluorescence
responses of the FCDs for the addition of different common cations,
and the concentration of each cation is 2 mM (λex = 360 nm).

To determine whether
the proposed strategy is selective for Fe3+ sensing, 13
other common cations were also investigated.
Operationally, these 13 common cations including Ba2+,
Cd2+, Mn2+, Na+, Mg2+,
K+, Ca2+, NH4+, Al3+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, and
Co2+ were tested for the same conditions in the presence
of 2 mM Fe3+. By comparing (F0 – F) of Fe3+ with those of the
other targets in Figure 8c (F0 and F correspond
to the fluorescence intensity of FCDs before or after adding these
common cations), it is not hard to find that only Fe3+ induce
obvious quenching, whereas other cations display little quenching
effect, which forcefully suggests that the as-prepared FCDs in SBCW
have high selectivity toward Fe3+ over the other relevant
cations. These results prove that the FCDs prepared in SBCW have high
sensitivity and outstanding selectivity for Fe3+ sensing.

Fluorescent Ink for Patterning
Because of the bright
fluorescence of FCDs, they were also used as inks for drawing patterns.
The FCDs were dissolved in water because of their excellent water
solubility aforementioned. After drawing (Figure 9a), the FCDs patterns closely attached on
the paper and gave significant fluorescence spectrum under a 365 nm
UV lamp excitation (Figure 9b), whereas the paper showed a negligible background UV fluorescence
(Figure 9c), and the
fluorescence peak of the FCDs in the solid state is the same as that
of the FCDs in solution, at 440 nm (Figure 4a). Many baseplates such as textiles, certain
flexible plastic films, and even the skin of animals can be printed
by FCDs because of the natural raw material milk and the nontoxic
preparation process. Further, the FCD ink shows good photostability,
which can be seen from the pattern and fluorescence emission spectra
after continuous irradiation under the UV lamp (365 nm) for 1 h (Figure S7), suggesting that the FCDs are promising
for antifake labeling.

ink under
daylight and (b) 365 nm UV lamp excitation. (c) Fluorescence emission
spectra of the FCDs in solid state and background fluorescence of
the paper (λex = 360 nm).

Preparation of FCDs/SiO2 Nanocomposites
As a
result of fluorescence quenching in solid state, there are no
obvious fluorescence from FCD powders when illuminated by UV light
(Figure S8). As shown in Figure 10a,b, blue emissions are visualized
from the FCDs/SiO2 nanocomposite films with different volumes
of FCDs (200, 100, 50, and 0 μL) under a 365 nm UV lamp irradiation.
The fluorescence spectra (Figure 10c) of FCDs/SiO2 nanocomposite films with
different volumes of FCDs were measured to further indicate that this
method can restrain fluorescence quenching because the silica matrix
was formed faster and the FCDs were embedded into silica by physical
doping between the FCDs and silica.44Figures 10d,e, S9, and S10 show that the FCDs/SiO2 nanocomposite powders also have blue fluorescence under a 365 nm
UV lamp excitation. The FCDs/SiO2 nanocomposites might
be used in light-emitting diodes, which are potentially used in indoor
lighting.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have demonstrated the synthesis of nitrogen-doped
FCDs in SBCW by using expired milk as the nitrogen and carbon precursor,
offering a means to use one facility’s waste (expired milk)
as another’s input, thereby reducing the raw materials required
and waste generated. The reaction process in the SBCW apparatus was
allowed for real-time monitoring of temperature and pressure, making
the newly developed approaches suitable for scalable mass production.
The prepared FCDs, with an average size of 2 nm, contained a large
amount of functional groups like −COOH and −OH, and
a handful of N-containing groups, displaying excellent water solubility
and exhibiting strong excitation wavelength-dependent blue emission.
Meanwhile, the FCDs have also been used for bioimaging, fluorescent
sensing of Fe3+, solid-state patterning, and transparent
fluorescent hybrid composites, showing the potential for solid-state
fluorescent sensing, antifake labeling, and wearable optoelectronics.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The milk products were purchased from the
local supermarket and used as the precursor for the synthesis of FCDs
when they were 3 days overdue. The other chemicals were purchased
from Beijing Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. and used as received.
Deionized (DI) water was prepared by a Hitech Laboratory Water Purification
System DW100 (Shanghai Hitech Instruments Co., Ltd.) and used for
all experiments.

Synthesis of FCDs
The setup of the
SBCW apparatus is
similar to that of our previous reports.45 Briefly, the MR was loaded with 20 mL of water and 25 mL of milk
and then heated to a temperature of 180 °C using a heater, and
the mixture was constantly stirred at 800 rpm for 2 h, which was controlled
by the reactor controller. The system was maintained at a constant
pressure of 1.2 MPa, which, ensuring water inside the apparatus, was
in a subcritical state. Then, the FCDs were obtained by centrifuging
(10 000 rpm for 20 min) and filtering through 0.22 μm
Millipore syringe filters. The final product of the FCD powder was
prepared by freeze-drying. It should be noted that no specific separation/purification
processes were involved in our experiments, and the obtained FCDs
have shown good performance in the applications including bioimaging,
fluorescent sensing of Fe3+, solid-state patterning, and
transparent fluorescent hybrid composites (see the Results and Discussion section). Further purification may
be needed for further potential applications such as super-resolution
bioimaging and optoelectronic devices.

Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were
observed by a Hitachi HT-7700 transmission electron microscope. The
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra were
characterized by a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. An Edinburgh
Instruments FS5 fluorescence spectrometer was used to measure the
fluorescence spectra of the samples. The FTIR spectra were recorded
using a Thermo Fisher spectrum Nicolet 6700 FTIR instrument. A Thermo
Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250 XPS system was used for the analysis
of the surface properties of the samples. The XRD patterns were obtained
with a Rigaku 2500VB2+PC X-ray diffractometer. The fluorescence QY
was acquired using an integrating sphere incorporated into an Edinburgh
Instruments FLS980 spectrofluorometer.

Cell Viability Experiments
The cell viability experiments
were performed using a Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8), which was purchased
from Dojindo Laboratory, Japan. A total of 96 wells of HeLa cells
were prepared, containing about 6 × 103 cells in each
well. The HeLa cells were randomly separated into four groups. Three
groups were treated with the synthesized FCDs at a concentration of
100, 200, and 300 μg/mL. The other group of HeLa cells included
blank control cell lines without any treatment. After incubation for
6 h, 10 μL of CCK-8 was added to each well, and the HeLa cells
were incubated for another 1 h. At the same time, the cell viability
tests were further investigated by using mouse BMSCs P2. A total of
96 wells of mouse BMSCs P2 were prepared, containing about 2.5 ×
103 cells in each well. Further, the mouse BMSCs P2 were
separated into five groups. Four groups were treated with the synthesized
FCDs at a concentration of 100, 200, 300, and 400 μg/mL. The
other group of cells included the blank control cell lines without
any treatment. All the groups were incubated for 0, 12, 24, and 48
h, respectively. The CCK-8 was mixed with the medium in a ratio of
1:10, and the mouse BMSCs P2 were incubated for another 2 h. The absorbance
was measured at 450 nm. The cell viability of all the control cells
was assumed to be 100%, and the relative viability of the cells treated
with various samples was estimated. The whole experiment was repeated
four times.

In Vitro Cell Imaging
HeLa cells
were cultured in a
Dulbecco’s minimum essential media with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. For fluorescence
imaging, the untreated cells and those treated with FCDs (200 μg/mL)
were examined. The cells were then incubated
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 6 h. Thereafter, all the
cell samples were gently washed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline and directly imaged using two-photon-excited fluorescence microscopy,
using a 780 nm (40 mW) femtosecond laser irradiation.

Fluorescent
Sensing of Fe3+
The related
experiments were conducted in a NaAc–HAc (10 mM) buffer solution
to avoid the hydrolysis of Fe3+. Typically, 300 μL
of FCDs was added into 60 mL of NaAc–HAc, and then 2.5 mL of
the FCDs of the (NaAc–HAc) solution and the same volume of
Fe3+ (2 mM) were mixed and reacted for 5 min. For sensitivity
study, different concentrations of Fe3+ within 2 mM were
examined in the same way. The selectivity of Fe3+ detection
was confirmed by adding a variety of positive ions including Ba2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, NH4+, Al3+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ ions instead of Fe3+ (2 mM). The
fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded at an excitation of 360
nm. The whole experiment was repeated three times.

Preparation
of FCDs/SiO2 Nanocomposites
FCDs (11 mg) were
dissolved in 10 mL of DI water, and then different
concentrations of FCDs (200, 100, 50, and 0 μL) were added into
500 μL of KH-792 and 2 mL of water. The mixtures were sonicated
for 5 min to form homogeneous solutions. The FCDs/SiO2 films
and powders were obtained through a facile heating (80 °C) and
grinding process.
