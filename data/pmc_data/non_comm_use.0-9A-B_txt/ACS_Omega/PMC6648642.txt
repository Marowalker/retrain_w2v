The NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor has been implicated in controlling synaptic plasticity,
memory, and learning. Herein, we describe an 11C-labeled
PET radiotracer based on 1-(4-chlorophenethyl)-6-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-7-ol,
Ro04-5595. The radiotracer was evaluated in rats using PET. The PET
study showed a good pharmacokinetic profile with rapid uptake and
washout over 90 min. Complementary high-resolution autoradiographic
images using [3H]Ro04-5595 demonstrated strong binding
in NR2B receptor-rich regions and low binding in cerebellum where
NR2B concentration is low. We conclude to have developed a selective
NR2B receptor radioligand suitable for quantitative and qualitative
imaging of a NR2B receptor distribution in vitro and in vivo.

==== Body
Introduction
The NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor
is a ligand-gated ion channel, which reacts to binding of the amino
acids l-glycine, l-glutamate, and NMDA. NMDA receptors
are comprised of eight different NR1 subunits and four different NR2
subunits (A–D). The actual ion channels are tetramers constituted
of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits, leading to distinct varieties of
NMDA receptors.1 The various subtypes have
different expression patterns in the central nervous system. Brain
regions rich in NR2B subunits are found in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus.2−4 By allowing influx of Ca2+, K+, and similar cations, NR2B mediates essential excitatory neurotransmission
in healthy tissue, which may be altered in conditions such as schizophrenia.
Inhibition of the receptor protects against the abnormal excitation
of neurons implied in neurodegenerative diseases. Because of the potential
relevance as target for the clinical management of neurodegenerative
diseases, there is a profound need for suitable NR2B radioligands
in the brain imaging community.5,6 In addition, among NMDA
ligands, NR2B selective antagonists have the advantage of being significantly
less susceptible to impair locomotion in subjects compared to other
NMDA subunit selective ligands.7 We became
interested in the receptor primarily for positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging because of the role attributed to NMDA receptors in
mechanisms leading to brain damage, for example, in stroke, hypoglycaemia,
and dementia. Several ligands with promising in vitro properties have
been developed; however, their translational development into PET
radiotracers has not yet been entirely successful. Some evaluated
candidates fail to penetrate the blood brain barrier,8,9 others are metabolized too rapidly,10,11 and the majority
has shown selectivity issues5,12−17 often with high affinity to σ-receptors. Following thorough
screening of the literature, we selected 1-(4-chlorophenethyl)-6-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-7-ol,
Ro 04–5595 (1) as the lead for the development
of new radioligands. Compound 1 is described as an NR2B
antagonist with selectivity over NR1 and NR2A receptor subtypes and
a reported Kd estimate of 20 ± 3
nM from competitive binding studies.2,18,19

Results and Discussion
A library
was designed to study the influence of methylation on
the guaiacol ring, conformational restriction on the ethylene bridge,
and substitution of the Cl-atom by fluorinated derivatives on binding
(Scheme 1). Contrary
to multistep Bischler–Napieralski reaction-based strategies
methodological, structural variation became possible in a single step
by condensing readily available phenethyl amines with substituted
cinnamic aldehydes.20 Pictet–Spengler
cyclization reactions produced modest to good yields (24–83%)
using 2a for all cinnamic aldehydes; however, 2b only afforded practically useful yields using p-NO2-cinnamic aldehyde (59%). p-Cl-cinnamic
aldehyde produced 8%, which was sufficient for precursor synthesis
(4f) (Supporting Information). N-methylation of 4a-4g was
conveniently accomplished with formaldehyde and sodium triacetoxyborohydride.
Catalytic hydrogenation was performed using Raney nickel instead of
palladium on charcoal, which partially dechlorinated 5b. Anilines (5g and 5h) were converted into
their corresponding chloride via a Sandmeyer reaction using sodium
nitrite and copper(I) chloride.

Scheme 1 General Synthetic Strategya
(a) (i) EtOH, 35 °C, reduced
pressure and (ii) TFA, 120 °C, mw; (b) (i) H2CO, DCE
and (ii) Na(OAc)3BH; (c) Raney nickel, H2, MeOH/AcOH;
(d) Raney Ni, H2, MeOH; (e) (i) NaNO2, HCl,
H2O and (ii) CuCl in HCl.

We initially
evaluated the compounds (1, 4a-4g,
5a–5i, 6a-6f) via preliminary screening wherein the
synthesized ligands were evaluated by how well they displaced [3H]ifenprodil ([3H]7) on rat brain
sections (Supporting Information). Ifenprodil
is structurally very similar to both eliprodil and Ro 25-6981 but
different from 1 and therefore a suitable ligand for
studying binding displacement.

The competitive binding data
was validated via autoradiography
using [3H]7 (27 nM) and 1 at
seven concentrations to obtain an estimate of IC50 = 5
± 10 nM (Ki = 2 ± 4 nM). The
experiment had a larger uncertainty but was deemed sufficient for
the preliminary screening. The relatively large uncertainty is explained
by a low signal-to-noise ratio coming from residual nonspecific binding
of [3H]7. Wiping experiments showed that 16%
displacement of the total binding of [3H]7 (27 nM) could be attributed to NR2B binding using 1 at 1 μM. The most promising derivatives were further evaluated
via autoradiography at 1 and 10 μM where the displacement of
[3H]7 in both hippocampus (NR2B specific binding)
and cerebellum (non-NR2B binding) was evaluated (Supporting Information).

Conformationally constrained,
(E)-configured derivatives 1, 5a−f obtained via introduction
of a double bond into the structure displayed lower potency than their
freely rotable counterparts 6a−f.26 Substitution of the chlorine atom by fluoro
or trifluoromethyl substituents did lead to potent inhibitors of [3H]7 binding; however, none of the novel, fluorinated
analogues in our library was found to be superior to 1. Most compounds even displaced [3H]7 in the
cerebellum, which is devoid of NR2B receptors, indicating binding
to other proteins.21 To the contrary, 1 (1 μM) showed no displacement of [3H]7 (27 nM) in the cerebellum but 23 ± 2% displacement
in hippocampus. Therefore, we decided to subordinate the new compounds
to 1 and continue with a thorough characterization of
the ligand starting with PET.

To facilitate small animal PET
studies in rats, 1-(4-chlorophenethyl)-6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-7-ol
was synthesized and subjected to 11C-methylation with [11C]CH3I via the captive solvent method,22 where the precursor was trapped on the HPLC
injection loop and radioalkylated by passing [11C]MeI through
the line. The PET radiotracer [11C]1 was obtained
in a yield of 13 ± 3% (compare with Scheme 2), a radiochemical purity (RCP) of 99% and
a molar activity of 12–43 MBq/nmol. [11C]1 was injected intravenously via the tail vein into anaesthetized
(isofluorane), male Sprague–Dawley rats, 12–16 weeks,
380–420 g. One group was injected with no carrier added radioligand,
and one rat was injected with carrier-added radioligand at a higher
concentration (1 mg/kg). A 90 min dynamic PET scan was performed.
For determination of metabolites in the blood and brain, [11C]1 was administered to three further rats for metabolite
studies. However, the remaining radioactivity after processing was
too low to be useful for accurate determination of metabolites. We
believe a likely reason is because of N-demethylation, which produces 11CO2 that diminishes the radioactive signal but
is eliminated from the blood stream and subsequently exhaled.

Scheme 2 Radiosynthesis of [11C]1
RCY = radiochemical yield,
EOS = end of synthesis, and RCP = radiochemical purity.

Although a racemic mixture was employed in the study,
the radiotracer
distribution obtained with PET is comparable to the autoradiography
results. The highest uptake is found in the hippocampus, followed
by the cortex, caudate putamen, and thalamus. By far, the lowest binding
is observed in the cerebellum. In baseline scans, radioactivity concentration
in the brain peaks at 0.7% ID/mL about 5 min into the scan, followed
by washout over the following 65 min (Figure 3). Half maximal concentration in the NR2B-rich
regions is reached 30 min post injection (p.i.). When the radiotracer
was injected in a low specific activity (1 mg/kg rat), the radioactivity
concentration in the brain peaked earlier (1 min) (Supporting Information); however, at a higher value (0.9%
ID/mL) was presumably due to blocking of peripheral binding sites.
In these scans, half maximal concentration is observed at 11 mins,
indicating a faster washout consistent with NR2B blocking (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Summed images (15–68
min p.i.) of [11C]1 (20.5 MBq) in the rat
brain and time activity curves for
hippocampus (orange), cerebellum, (red) and caudate putamen (black);
average of n = 3.

Pleased with the PET study results that indicate brain uptake,
we continued with high-resolution autoradiography experiments for
determining both the Kd of 1 on rat and mouse brain sections and for investigating the binding
pattern. Autoradiography would also allow for a series of competition
experiments to validate the specificity of binding to NMDA receptors.
Unfortunately, the chemical structure of 1 does not contain
a fluorine atom, which made necessary the use of carbon-11 (11C, t1/2 = 20 min) as the radionuclide
for PET imaging instead of fluorine-18 (18F, t1/2 = 110 min) which due to its longer half-life would
have been preferred. Carbon-11 is not suitable for high-resolution
autoradiography and the short half-life complicates in vitro experiments.
Therefore, we decided to prepare and use 3H-labeled 1-(4-chlorophenethyl)-6-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroiso-quinolin-7-ol,
[3H]1, which could be obtained conveniently
by catalytic tritiation with an 3H2 and Crabtree’s
catalyst. The radioligand [3H]1 was labeled
with a molar activity of 1.04 GBq/μmol in a radiochemical purity
of 99%. [3H]1 was used for autoradiography
imaging on both rat and mouse brain sections (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Typical image of [3H]1 (20 nM [3H]1, 10.5 kBq) on a mouse brain
section and displacement
curve of [3H]1 (4 nM) from the cortex in sagittal
rat brain sections by increasing concentrations of (R)-1 and (S)-1 in duplicate.
Specific binding correspond to 24% of total binding in the cortex.

Images obtained with [3H]1 were found to
show an activity distribution corresponding well with the distribution
of NR2B mRNA, albeit in a somewhat more diffuse microdistribution.
Furthermore, binding of [3H]1 matched the
reported distribution obtained using [3H]7 or [3H]Ro 25-9681 with retention in NR2B-rich regions
such as the cortex, hippocampus, and to a lesser extent the striatum
and thalamus.19 To rule out likely cross
affinities based on structure similarity to opioid receptor antagonists,
naloxone (1 μM) was added to [3H]1 (20
nM) on mouse brain sections. In the presence of naloxone, no displacement
was observed. An addition of 30 μM of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor
GBR-12909 (30 μM), described to displace [3H]7 from σ and piperidine binding sites by Carter et.
al,23 showed minor displacement, possibly
indicating some cross affinity. Furthermore, wiping studies using
varying molar activities of [3H]1 in the presence
of 7 (10 μM) yielded no displacement but instead
an increased retention of radioligand (15–40%) at lower concentrations
(1–45 nM of 1) and no effect at higher concentrations
(200 nM and 10 μM) compared to control. We believe the reason
for the unexpected results is that 7 has a high affinity
to other receptors beside NR2B such as σ-receptors. In addition, 7 may influence metabolism of 1. However, autoradiographic
results clearly demonstrated a concentration-dependent displacement
of [3H]7 by 1 in NR2B-rich regions
(cortex and hippocampus) with no displacement in the cerebellum indicating
identical binding sites (see above).

Enantiomerically pure 1 (R and S) was synthesized
via crystallisation of 4c with (R )-
and (S)-O-acetylmandelic acids,
respectively (Supporting Information). Absolute configuration of the enantiomers was
established via X-ray diffraction on a crystal of 7a (Supporting Information).27 The enantiomers were evaluated by incubating [3H]1 in the presence of either the R or S enantiomer of 1 in increasing concentrations
(0, 4, 12, 28, 60, 124 nM) on sagittal rat brains (Figure 2). The enantiomer (R)-1 demonstrated a Ki of 2 nM, whereas the S enantiomer was much
less potent. Because of the lack of saturation of [3H]1 binding by (S)-1, curve fits
did not converge on a Ki value.

Bmax was estimated to be around 0.5–1
nmol/mL in the cortex using an Eadie–Hofstedt plot (Supporting Information). At low concentration
(<4 nM) of [3H]1, the molar activity of
the radioligand in combination with the low Bmax leads to a poor signal-to-noise ratio obscuring the specific
signal. Off-target binding has been a notorious confounder of proposed
NMDA (NR2B) ligands described in the literature and next to all commercially
available reference compounds. Instead of performing additional blocking
studies with structurally very similar ligands to 7,
we subjected 1 to a panel screening of brain targets
at a concentration of 10 μM. Compounds showing 50% or higher
inhibition of binding to a target in said primary assay were then
tested in a concentration-dependent manner to obtain inhibition constants
(Ki). Figure 3 shows the outcome
of the broad-spectrum screen and Ki values
for critical targets. The assay revealed that 1 does
not bind to any of the tested receptors, transporters, and ion channels
with high affinity. The notable exception is the mu opioid receptor
(MOR) (Table 1) for
which a Ki of 66 nM was obtained. However,
when coincubating [3H]1 with the MOR antagonist
naloxone at a concentration of 1 μM, no inhibition of [3H]1 binding was observed. In our own experience,24 a single-figured nanomolar affinity is nanomolar
affinity is necessary to image MOR because of its inherent low concentration
in the brain.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully
synthesized and characterized a selective
NR2B radioligand. We believe that a large part of the nonspecific
binding seen in AR and PET come from the non-NR2B binding enantiomer
((S)-1). Reconstructed dynamic PET data
using [11C]1 show much promise with an NR2B-like
distribution, fair brain uptake, and washout within the duration of
the PET scan (90 min). By utilizing the PET images coupled with autoradiographic
images of the distribution of [3H]1, we were
able to assess NR2B binding in vivo and with excellent resolution
in vitro. In both cases, binding was confined to NR2B receptor-rich
regions with very little visible off-target binding. We identified
the (R)-1 enantiomer as the NR2B-binding ligand.

Section
General Experimental Methods
Reactants, reagents, and
solvents used herein were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, Tocris Biosciences,
or Perkin-Elmer in the highest quality, unless otherwise specified.
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVII
400 NMR instrument (Bruker ASX Nordic AB). Chemical shifts (δ)
for proton (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) resonances are reported
in parts per million (ppm), relative to the solvent signal (CDCl3 δ = 7.226 ppm), and downfield from the expected tetramethylsilane
signal (TMS, δ = 0 ppm). Mass spectrometry was conducted on
a maXis II ETD from Bruker Daltonics time of flight instrument with
a flight tube of 3 m using electron spray ionization in a positive
mode. Calculated exact mass is reported for the positively charged
ion. The samples were prepared in a solution from methanol or acetonitrile
in 1 mg/mL concentration. TLC was conducted on Silica gel 60 F254-coated aluminum TLC plates (Supelco, USA).
Optical rotation was measured on a polarimeter (Perkin Elmer model
341) at 589.6 nM and 20 °C in methanol (MeOH) using a 10 cm-long
tube with 1 mL capacity. Values are averaged from at least three measurements
using the same sample. Autoradiography data was evaluated using AIDA
imaging analyzer software version 5.1 from Elysia-Raytest and GraphPad
Prism 6. Brain tissues were cut using a Thermo-Fischer Scientific
Cryo Star NX-70 cryostat. LSC was done using a HIDEX 300 SL, and autoradiographic
screens were read using a Dürr CR35 Bio Plus image plate scanner.
Compounds used for biological characterization were of equal or greater
purity than 95%.

11C-Methylation
Carbon-11
was produced using
a Siemens Eclipse cyclotron in the form of [11C]CO2. The labeling process was automated on a Synthra MeI plus
research synthesis module. 11C-Methylation of 1-(4-chlorophenethyl)-6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-7-ol
(0.4 mg, 1.3 μmol) was methylated using [11C]CH3I, using captive solvent radiosynthesis in DMF (50 μL)
via heating at 40 °C for 1 min. Purification of the crude product
was performed on a Macherey-Nagel VarioPrep NUCLEODUR C18 Pyramid,
5 μm, 250 mm × 10 mm HPLC column, using a flow of 5.5 mL/min
and MeCN–0.1 M HCO2NH4 buffer, 44:56
as mobile phase. The product fraction containing [11C]1 was collected after a retention time of 5.6–6.5 min.

General Pictet–Spengler Cyclization Reaction
To phenethylamine
(1.3 mmol) in Et2O (1 mL) was added
cinnamic aldehyde (200 mg, 1.0 mmol). Solvent was removed under reduced
pressure at 30 mbar at 40 °C. TFA (2.0 mL) was added. The reaction
mixture was purged with argon and heated in a microwave reactor (120–130
°C for 15–60 min). The reaction mixture was basified via
addition of aqueous ammonia (veratrol) or NaHCO3 (guaiacol)
and diluted with EtOAc. The phases were separated, and the aqueous
phase was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic phases were washed
with brine, dried over sodium sulphate, and evaporated to dryness
under reduced pressure. Purification via flash column chromatography
using 2–8% MeOH in DCM yielded the target compound.

General
Hydrogenation
To Raney nickel in MeOH (5 mL)
was added a magnetic stirrer bar, and the slurry was vigorously stirred.
The solvent was withdrawn, and the washing step was repeated two additional
times. Alkene dissolved in MeOH/AcOH (4:1, 40 mL/mmol) was added and
H2 fitted. The reaction was left over night. The catalyst
was filtered off, and solvents were removed under reduced pressure.
The reaction mixture was basified with aqueous ammonia (for veratrole
derivatives) or pH adjusted to 8–9 with saturated NaHCO3 (for guaiacol derivatives) and extracted with EtOAc. The
combined organic phases were washed with brine and dried over sodium
sulphate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the
crude was purified via flash column chromatography affording the target
compounds.
