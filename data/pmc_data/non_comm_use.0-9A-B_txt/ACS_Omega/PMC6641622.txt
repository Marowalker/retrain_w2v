Herein, we wish to report fabrication
of multifaceted environmentally
friendly benign renewable resource-based waterborne hyperbranched
polyester nanocomposites using three different doses of carbon dot@TiO2 nanohybrid through a facile in situ polymerization technique
in the absence of solvent or additional catalyst. Carbon dot@TiO2 nanohybrid was prepared through a greener one-pot hydrothermal
process from bio-based raw materials. The nanocomposites were characterized
by different instrumental techniques. The thermosets of these nanocomposites
are obtained by curing them with glycerol-based hyperbranched epoxy
and fatty acid-based poly(amido amine). Enhancements of 6.67 folds
tensile strength, 3.8 folds toughness, 1.7 folds Young’s modulus,
>2.5 units gloss, and 46 °C thermal stability were observed
for
the thermosets by the formation of nanocomposites. The nanocomposites
also showed antifogging and anti-icing properties. More interestingly,
they can also be used for efficient separation of crude oil and water
from their mixture. Thus, these environmentally benign polymeric materials
could find applications in different fields.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Advanced
materials with unique multifunctional activities are the
ultimate choice of the material community, which may be achieved through
the unison of molecular engineering and nanotechnology. These materials
not only assist the economy of a country, but also help to conserve
exhaustible resources.1 In this milieu,
polymer nanocomposites enjoy synergistic advantages of both polymers
and nanomaterials and hence received tremendous interest over the
last two decades or so.1,2 Again, polyesters among different
polymers deserve special attention due to their inherent advantages
like excellent processability and good compatibility with others,
low density, good chemical resistance (except alkali), high flexibility,
and overall low cost.3,4 However, as they suffer from poor
mechanical strength, alkali resistance, and thermal stability, their
advanced applications are limited.4 In
this context, to address the above drawbacks and to impart new interesting
properties, suitable nanomaterials may be incorporated into them.1,2 Several studies on the incorporation of various inorganic nanomaterials,
such as ZnS,5 graphene,6 clay,7 multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs),8 TiO2,9 etc., into the polyester matrices to obtain nanocomposites
with desirable properties have been cited in the literature. However,
among them, TiO2 is found to be very interesting as its
polymer nanocomposites like epoxy,10 polyurethane,11 polyester,9,12 etc. offered not only
improvement in mechanical, thermal, etc. properties but also impart
some unique and useful attributes.11,12 Further, studies
on polyester/TiO2 nanocomposites are not comprehensive
and systematic. Ghanem et al. reported fabrication of a hyperbranched
polyester nanocomposite using TiO2 by both in situ and
ex situ methods but studied only its photocatalytic activity.12 Zhang et al. studied only the thermal properties
of copolyester/TiO2 nanocomposites.13 Similarly, Santos et al. reported only the thermal properties
and hardness of the nanocomposites of poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) and TiO2.9 Therefore,
all of the above-cited reports did not address the above-mentioned
unique properties. In addition, they were obtained from petroleum
resources and solvent-borne systems were used. Both of these are against
the tenets of green chemistry as well as unable to maintain the concept
of triple bottom line approach. As these are the central requirements
for any kind of sustainable development, an environmentally benign
facile approach involving waterborne system and renewable resources
is the most desirable one to be adopted.3,4 Further, the
use of bio-based renewable resources addresses the exhaustion of petroleum
resources as well as refreshes the environment through achievement
of carbon credit.4 It is not out of the
scope to mention that incorporation of unique structural hyperbranched
moiety in this system may also result in some unique attributes like
high solubility, lower melt, and solution viscosity that make it interesting
for many advanced applications.3,5 Thus, in the present
investigation, an attempt was made to incorporate TiO2 in
such waterborne hyperbranched polyester (WHP) systems to explore the
above-mentioned unique attributes on the resultant system. TiO2 was selected as a nanomaterial to achieve high thermostability,
delay heat conduction, and provide high free-energy barrier for ice
nucleation along with improvement of mechanical and thermal properties.
Furthermore, it influences optical and antibacterial activities. It
can also provide roughness to the organic polymer surface due to inherent
incompatibility as it is an inorganic material. All of these are the
essential requirement for achieving properties like anti-icing, antifogging,
oil–water separation, etc. In addition, TiO2 nanoparticles
are inert, nontoxic, relatively inexpensive, and environmentally friendly.
However, only bare TiO2 may have the compatibility problem
with polyester as the former does not possess as such any suitable
functionality to interact with such matrix. In addition, bare TiO2 leads to the formation of aggregates due to the high surface
energy, thus making them poorly dispersed into the matrix.10−12 In this context, carbon quantum dot (CD) is found to be more attractive
for its unique properties like low toxicity, chemical stability, high
water solubility, easy functionalizability, good compatibility with
other materials, etc. over inorganic quantum dots.14,15 Thus, to achieve the synergistic effect of CD and TiO2, a nanohybrid of them was prepared by a single-pot one-step facile
protocol and proposed to use. Incorporation of similar nanomaterials
other than TiO2 may also provide these properties; however,
the use of this nanohybrid provides not only anti-icing and antifogging
properties but also excellent enhancement in mechanical and thermal
properties. The surface with good mechanical stability and durability
is the necessary requirement for anti-icing and antifogging behavior.
The fabrication and designing of such antifogging and anti-icing surfaces
are very essential for using them in an array of applications.16−18 It is pertinent to mention here that even though this nanohybrid
has been reported in the literature19,20 no report
has been found so far on the incorporation of such nanohybrid in waterborne
hyperbranched polyester system and hence achieving these properties
simultaneously in such polymer is a daunting challenge. Thus, these
properties were studied using this polyester nanocomposite by following
a similar method to that reported earlier in different polymers.21−24 Furthermore, the use of a fabrication process without involving
a catalyst, organic solvent, and neutralizing agent not only reduces
volatile organic compounds but also addresses environmental pollution
and human health problems.

Therefore, the present study reports
the fabrication of an environmentally
benign multifunctional nanocomposite of waterborne hyperbranched polyester
and carbon dot@TiO2 (CD@TiO2) using bio-based
raw materials for the first time through a solvent-free benign in
situ polymerization method. Glycerol-based hyperbranched epoxy and
fatty acid-based poly(amido amine)-modified above nanocomposite was
evaluated as a tough polyester thermoset. The fabricated thermosetting
nanocomposites with different weight percents of nanohybrid were examined
as multipurpose advanced sustainable polymeric materials with special
attributes like anti-icing, antifogging, etc. This material was also
tried to be used as a membrane for separation of oil and water from
their mixture.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication of Thermosetting Nanocomposite
The nanocomposite
was obtained using a waterborne polyester and
a water-dispersible CD@TiO2 nanohybrid through a simple
in situ polymerization technique. Both the polyester and the nanohybrid
are environmentally friendly, as well as the fabrication process of
nanocomposite is nontoxic, odorless, nonflammable, environmentally
friendly, and easy to clean up. In addition, most of the precursors
used for fabrication of polyester and nanohybrid are naturally renewable,
i.e., bio-based, where the amount of bio-based raw materials is 56.27%
in polyester and 44% in the nanohybrid. Furthermore, the nanocomposite
was obtained through a greener approach in the absence of solvent
and catalyst, as well as a facile environmentally benign hydrothermal
method was used for the preparation of nanohybrid. Some raw materials
of hyperbranched epoxy and poly(amide amine) are also bio-based. Thus,
the approach is in accordance with some of the principles of green
chemistry.25 In addition, the pristine
waterborne polyester is a biodegradable material.4 Thus, from the material as well as processing viewpoints,
the nanocomposite has considerable greener contribution.

During
the fabrication process, different oxygen functional groups of the
nanohybrid interact covalently or noncovalently with the functional
groups of polyester matrix, as shown in Scheme 1. These types of interactions not only favor
uniform dispersion of the nanohybrid in the polyester matrix but also
generate significant amount of interfacial area. This is responsible
for the improvement in performance of the resultant material. Further,
the presence of large numbers of polar functionalities in the nanocomposites
helps in the formation of stable dispersion in most organic solvents
like dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, ethanol,
acetone, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, etc.

the Formation of Nanocomposite
2.2 Characterization of the Nanocomposite
The fabricated nanocomposites
were characterized by different spectroscopic techniques. The presence
of functional groups in the nanocomposites was confirmed by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) (Figure 1a,b) studies. From the FTIR spectrum of bare TiO2 (Figure 1a),
−O–H stretching and bending bands were observed at 3434
and 1632 cm–1, respectively.26 The broad band observed at around 681 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching mode of Ti–O bond, whereas
the band at 1400 cm–1 arises from TiO2 lattice vibrations.9 The stretching and
bending −O–H absorption bands of TiO2 are
shifted due to the formation of the nanohybrid. Further, additional
absorption bands at 2922 and 2852 cm–1 are assigned
to −C–H asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations
in the nanohybrid, respectively. However, the band at 681 cm–1 gets shifted to around 606 cm–1 after incorporation
of nanohybrid and bare TiO2 into the polyester matrix.27 The incorporation of nanohybrid in the nanocomposites
also leads to small shifts of some other FTIR absorption bands of
polyester. The shifting of the bands indicates the interactions of
carboxylic and hydroxyl groups of polyester matrix with the nanohybrid
through hydrogen-bonding or other polar–polar interactions.
Further, the observed broad band at 3500 cm–1 is
attributed to the interaction of hydroxyl groups of nanohybrid and
polyester matrix.

Figure 1 (a, b) FTIR spectra of nanomaterial and the nanocomposite
and (c,
d) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine polyester and nanocomposite.

The XRD pattern of pristine polyester
(Figure 1c) showed
a single broad peak in the range
of 10–30°, indicating its amorphous nature. In the XRD
patterns of the nanocomposites (Figure 1d), it is seen that the intensity of original peaks
of the nanohybrid as well as pristine system decreased and the peaks
were broadened. Further, some of the peaks for the nanohybrid in the
nanocomposite were diminished due to the presence of low amount of
nanohybrid in the nanocomposite as well as interactions between polyester
matrix and nanohybrid. These results indicate the structural modification
of both the nanomaterial and polyester by the formation of nanocomposite.10,11

The surface morphology of the nanocomposite and the state
of dispersion
of the nanohybrid in the polyester matrix were studied from transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. A good dispersion of the nanohybrid
in the matrix is crucial to achieve the desired nanoreinforcing effect
and thus obtain a high-performing material. The representative TEM
images of PCTN2.5 displayed a homogeneous distribution of the nanohybrid
in the polyester matrix, as shown in Figure 2a–c. The crystal lattice fringes with
a d-spacing of 0.36 nm correspond to the (101) plane
of anatase TiO2,19 and the lattice
spacing of 0.32 nm corresponding to the (002) plane of CD19,20 was also observed in high-resolution TEM images (Figure 2d,e). Further, the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 2f) of the nanocomposite reveals the semicrystalline
nature of the nanocomposite, which may arise due to the crystallinity
of TiO2 nanoparticles. Further, surface plot of the nanohybrid
(Figure S1) obtained from SEM image of
it using Fizi ImageJ software confirmed the roughness of its surface.

2.3 Rheological Study of the Nanocomposites
Rheological study of the nanocomposite was carried out using a
rheometer to obtain some information about the interactions between
the nanohybrid and the polyester matrix.8 Variations of shear viscosity with time and temperature under controlled
stress and a single shear value were examined for all of the nanocomposites
before curing. The results are shown in Figure 3a,b. It is noted that the viscosity remained
almost constant with time. The nanocomposites exhibited higher viscosity
than the pristine polyester due to the presence of interfacial interactions
between the rigid nanomaterials with the flexible polyester matrix.
Furthermore, dose-dependent viscosity was also obtained for the nanocomposites.
However, the shear viscosity of all of the nanocomposites decreased
with the increase of temperature. This is due to the increase in kinetic
energy of the different components present in the nanocomposites,
which decreases the structure-forming tendency of the polymer molecules
and thus decreases viscosity. Further, viscoelasticity is a combination
of elastic (solidlike) and viscous (liquidlike) behaviors, which are
usually described by storage modulus (G′)
and loss modulus (G″), respectively.28 These parameters were measured as a function
of frequency (1–10 s–1) under constant temperature
(25 °C) and constant stress (20 Pa). The dependence of the viscoelastic
behavior of nanocomposite on the loadings of the nanohybrid was also
studied. The results are shown in Figure 3c,d, and it is noted that both G′ and G″ increase with the increase
of frequency (1–10 s–1) at different rates
as well as with the loadings of the nanohybrid. The trend of changes
was in good agreement with the results demonstrated in the literature.28,29 This is due to the improvement of elastic behavior of the nanocomposites
upon incorporation of the nanohybrid. This improvement arises from
the strong interactions between the nanohybrid and the polymer matrix.
The solidlike elastic behavior, i.e., G″ < G′, of the nanocomposites is due to the combination
of polymer–nanohybrid and polymer–polymer interactions.
This indicates the formation of a continuous network inside the polymer
matrix. Furthermore, the variation of G′ and G″ with respect to temperature (25–75 °C)
under constant frequency (1 Hz) and a controlled oscillatory stress
of 20 Pa is shown Figure 3e,f. The decrease in G′ and G″ with the increase in temperature was observed
for all of the nanocomposites. This is owing to the increase in kinetic
energy and free volume of the polymer chains, which in turn decreases
inter- and intramolecular interactions as well as entanglement density
in the system. Thus, this result clearly demonstrated strong interactions
between nanohybrid and the polyester matrix.8,28,29

2.4 Performance
of the Thermosetting Nanocomposites
The improvement of the
mechanical properties of the nanocomposites
is the central interest of their fabrication. The nature of branching
in the polymer chain plays a significant role in the contribution
of mechanical properties, and increase in the amount of polar side
chains in polymer backbone results in an enhanced tensile strength.
Further, functional groups of nanocomposites play a vital role in
increasing the interaction energy between the nanomaterial and the
polymer matrix.28 The interaction between
the nanohybrid and the polymer matrix is significant because uniformly
dispersed nanoparticles in a polymeric matrix impart a high portion
of interface owing to their high surface area. The weak interactions
between them result in lower mechanical strength than the pristine
system as the external applied load of the nanocomposite is unable
to transfer to the nanomaterials.28−32 The mechanical properties, such as tensile strength,
toughness, elongation at break, impact resistance, Young’s
modulus, and scratch hardness of the nanocomposites, were evaluated
and the results are given in Table 1. It is seen that the incorporation of even a small
amount of the nanohybrid significantly improved the performance of
the pristine polyester. This may be due to the combined effect of
small size, large surface area, and quantum confinement of the nanohybrid
as well as its strong interfacial interactions with the polyester
matrix.29,30 The tensile strength of pristine polyester
was improved after the formation of nanocomposite with both bare TiO2 and CD@TiO2 nanohybrids; however, the nanocomposite
with 1 wt % bare TiO2 showed lower value of tensile strength
than the nanohybrid (1 wt %). This is due to the incompatibility of
TiO2 with the polyester matrix. The absence of suitable
functionality in TiO2 to interact with the matrix is the
probable cause of this result. Further, fine particle size of TiO2 leads to the formation of aggregate, as observed in the literature,
making it poorly dispersed into the matrix. However, in case of nanohybrid,
CD helps in its better dispersion and stabilization due to the presence
of a large number of polar functional groups, which can interact with
the polyester matrix. Further, the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites
were found to be highly dependent on the loading of the nanohybrid.
As the loading of the nanohybrid increases, the mechanical strength
of the nanocomposite improved in the same manner. The tensile strength
of PCTN2.5 increases 6.6 times compared to the pristine polyester.
The nanoscale size effect of the nanohybrid can lead to a close association
with the polyester matrix, which may be strengthened with the increase
of nanohybrid loading. This tensile strength value is found to be
superior to the reported polyester/MWCNT (28–35 MPa),31 vinyl ester/TiO2 (3.70–5.72
MPa),32 polyester/clay (2.42–6.28
MPa),7 PECD0.5 (26.1 MPa),33 poly(ethylene terephthalate)/TiO2 (27.1–34.4
MPa),34 and other nanocomposites. However,
elongation at break decreased after the formation of nanocomposite
and also decreased with increase in the loading of nanohybrid. Even
then the strain value (>200%) of the nanocomposites was significantly
high. This is because of the presence of different flexible moieties
like aliphatic moieties of polyester and hardener, ether linkages,
etc., as well as plasticizing effect of the long hydrocarbon chain
of hardener.30 Further, the interactions
shown in Scheme 2 are
associated with various secondary interactions, such as polar–polar,
H-bonding, and other interactions of the polar functional groups,
which may help in full molecular chain extension of the polyester.
Furthermore, graphitic structure of CD with polar functional groups
may result in good flexibility due to slippage of layers during the
application of high load. The polar functional groups of CD also provide
strong physicochemical interactions with the polar groups of polyester,
hyperbranched epoxy, and poly(amido amine) hardener and help in full
extension of chain molecules. Further, these values were found to
be better than those of the already reported nanocomposites of epoxy/TiO2 (2–3.5%),10 polyester/clay
(12.45),7 PET/clay (2–3%),28 polyester/MWCNT (4–8%),31 PET/TiO2 (30.5–34.4%),34 and PECD0.5 (162%).33 Typical
stress–strain curves and tensile process of the nanocomposites
are shown in Figure 4a,b, and areas under these curves were used to measure toughness
of the material. The toughness of the nanocomposite was also found
to be enhanced, and the values increased with the loading of nanohybrid.
The values were superior to those reported for PECD0.5 (32.8 MJ/m3)33 and poly(phenyl sulfone)/TiO2 (15.5–20 MJ/m3)35 nanocomposite. Further, the toughness of the thermoset drastically
enhanced the other mechanical properties, such as impact resistance
and scratch hardness. Therefore, these properties were also improved
after the formation of nanocomposites. The impact resistance was higher
than 1–7 wt % TiO2-based unsaturated polyester nanocomposite
(4.2–6 kJ/m).36 The enhancement
of these properties is ascribed to the significant interfacial interactions
and good compatibility between the polyester matrix and the nanohybrid.
The small sizes of CD and TiO2 provide a large surface
area for strong interactions with the matrix and thus all of the mechanical
properties of the nanocomposites were improved without much affecting
flexibility. The peripheral polar functional groups of the nanohybrid
also provide strong physicochemical interactions with glycerol-based
hyperbranched epoxy and poly(amido amine) hardener, which also help
in the enhancement of the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites.9,10,28−32 Further, Young’s modulus of the nanocomposite
also increased dramatically with the loading of nanohybrid and this
may happen due to favorable size and distribution of the nanohybrid
that cause strong interactions between the nanohybrid and the polyester
matrix.

2.5 Thermal Properties of the Nanocomposites
The thermal
stability of the nanocomposites was studied from thermogravimetric
analyses. The initial degradation temperature of polyester thermosets
increased after the formation of nanocomposites with bare TiO2 as well as CD@TiO2 nanohybrid. The initial degradation
temperature further increased with the increase of amount of nanohybrid
loading (Figure 4c).
The improvement in thermal stability is due to high cross-link density
and strong covalent and noncovalent interactions along with some secondary
interactions like polar–polar, hydrogen-bonding, and other
interactions.27,30 Both the pristine thermoset and
the nanocomposites were degraded mainly through two-stage degradation
patterns as observed in TGA curves, where the first step (250–270
°C) is related to the degradation of aliphatic moieties, whereas
the second stage (330–350 °C) is due to degradation of
aromatic moieties. However, DSC results (Figure 4d) clearly revealed no significant differences
in Tg values between the pristine polyester
and nanocomposite due to contradictory effect of increasing intermolecular
attractive forces as well as the occurrence of poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) shell around the nanohybrid. This interaction of flexible PEG
chain is due to favorable compatibility of the nanohybrid containing
Ti–O bonds with the −O– linkages of PEG.37

2.6 Antifogging and Anti-icing
Attributes of the
Nanocomposites
Prevention of fog is a daunting challenge
for various optical applications of transparent materials. This is
due to the reason that fog reduces the effectiveness of light transmission
and therefore optical efficiency.16−19 The antifogging property of the
nanocomposite was checked by placing the sample inside a refrigerator
for minimum 30 min and then exposing it to a humid laboratory environment,
and the results as well as visual transparency of both the bare glass
and nanocomposite films are shown in Figure 5a–c. In this figure, it is seen that
the bare glass slide after taking out from the refrigerator under
ambient conditions fogged immediately and presented a large amount
of tiny condensed droplets, causing a significant reduction of the
optical transmittance, and the words below are blurred. Although the
nanocomposite film (PCTN2.5) significantly prevented the formation
of fog and exhibited excellent transparency, the words below are clearly
visible. Thus, the nanocomposite film plays an active role in the
antifogging property of glass. Further, the same test was performed
in different samples and under different humid conditions (60–80%)
as well as over boiled water, and the results of these experiments
are given in Figure 6. It is seen that the nanocomposite exhibited antifogging behavior
in high humidity (60–80%); thus, it is expected to achieve
this property in low humidity too. Further, the uncoated glass over
boiling water showed condensation of water droplets and it became
hazy, whereas the coated glass slide remained clear after being removed
from the refrigerator (Figure 6). The antifogging performance could be because of the fact
that the more hydrophobic the material, the lower will be the rate
of water cooling. Further, longer times were required to form the
initial fog on the hydrophobic surface, especially on superhydrophobic
surface so that the nanocomposite was covered with least water droplets
and thus remained transparent in all times.38 The superhydrophobicity behavior of the material was explained by
measuring the contact angle of the surface (135–150°)
using ImageJ software (Figures S2 and S3; Table S1). The antifogging property of polyester nanocomposite was
not found in the literature and hence there is no scope for comparison.
However, a few other materials are reported in the literature, which
include 15 wt % PEG (Mw = 1000–6000
g/mol) and 30 wt % SiO2-modified TiO2 films,39 PEG-functionalized poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/poly(acrylic
acid),40 poly(vinyl alcohol)/Nafion film,41 etc. with antifogging property.

Furthermore, in recent years,
to solve the adhesion and accumulation
of ice, researchers have been more focused on the design of superhydrophobic
surfaces with nanoparticles, nanostructures, or anti-icing coatings
as chemicals are extremely expensive as well as procedures are complicated
and cause environmental hazards.42 Although
there are many reports on anti-icing behavior of superhydrophobic
surface using nanostructures, the anti-icing property of waterborne
polyester nanocomposite using CD@TiO2 was not reported
so far.43−45 Thus, the anti-icing property of polyester nanocomposite
was studied here. It was observed that the water droplets formed ice
on both the uncoated surface of aluminum and glass substrates, whereas
no ice formation was observed on the coated surface of glass and aluminum
plates (Figure 7a–g).
It is seen from this figure that after 1 min water droplets on the
uncoated surface start losing their transparency as ice formation
has started, whereas the droplets on the coated surface remained transparent.
Further, the freezing delay time of water droplets on the nanocomposite
surfaces (PCTN2.5) was measured by placing 5 μL of water droplets
at −15 °C (Figure 8) and the experiment was repeated several times to get the
statistical data using analysis of variance. The delay time during
the measuring process was defined as the time at which the water droplets
began to transform from being transparent to being completely frozen.
Initially, the water droplets were all transparent and the droplets
slowly became dense with time such that the light spot vanished. The
freezing delay time was found to be 940 ± 40 s. Furthermore,
the anti-icing test was performed on different surfaces (PCTN0.5 and
PCTN1) keeping the volume of the water droplet same (5 μL),
but the shape of the water droplet was different in case of bare glass
slide because of difference in the surface. It is seen from Figure 8 that all of the
nanocomposites showed excellent anti-icing behavior. This is due to
superhydrophobicity of the surfaces, which has excellent applicants
for icephobicity due to their extraordinary water repellency. Icephobicity
usually refers to an ability to delay or prevent ice nucleation and
deposition on surfaces. This can be achieved using surface with high
water contact angle and low surface energy. The formation of ice can
be prevented via two approaches: one is by reducing the contact time
to help quick shedding of water droplets before ice can nucleate on
the surface and the other is by delaying heterogeneous nucleation
through a combination of surface and therefore being able to prevent
the fog formation. The ice formation could be delayed in superhydrophobic
surface owing to the tardy heat conduction as well as high free-energy
barrier of nucleation. The delayed freezing of water droplets on the
superhydrophobic surfaces is explained as follows: rougher the surface
is, lower will be the water–solid contact area and hence more
entrapped air will be there in the water–solid interface. Therefore,
the process of heat exchange between the water droplets and solid
will slow down because of the presence of entrapped air in the water–surface
interface acting as an insulator. This process leads to longer and
delayed freezing time of water droplets. Thus, water droplets on coated
superhydrophobic surface were frozen with a much longer delay time
compared to their uncoated one.43−46 Studies on the anti-icing property of polyester-based
nanocomposite are very limited in the literature. However, studies
are available for the anti-icing property of fluorosilane-treated
aluminum panel47 and polybenzoxazine nanocomposite

In addition, the nanocomposite
can also be used as security ink
as it has unique properties like nonvisibility under visible light
but provides different colors at different wavelengths of UV light.
In addition, it also exhibited excellent thermal stability and photostability,
good compatibility with other materials, etc. For this purpose, a
solution of nanocomposite at a concentration of 2 mg/mL was used to
write the structure of phenol on a filter paper, which was not visible
under visible light. However, the same can be clearly seen under the
illumination of a 365 nm UV light (Figure 6h,i). This information can be seen repeatedly
as and when required under exposure of such wavelength of light. Thus,
this nanocomposite-based security ink can be used for preserving and
secretly communicating important information particularly for defense
system.

2.7 Separation of Oil and Water from Their Mixture
The separation of oil and water from their mixture is a daunting
challenge because of the increasing industrial oil-contaminated water
as well as the frequent oil spill accidents occurring across the globe.
Thus, the nanocomposite with excellent mechanical properties and repellency
to crude oil showed potential to further develop as an advanced oil/water
separation membrane. The separation of oil and water from their mixture
was performed as shown in Figure 9a–d. A thin membrane of the nanocomposite was
used to separate the oil–water mixture using a sintered funnel
with suction pumping system. The figure clearly revealed the efficient
separation of the components using nanocomposite membrane, whereas
no separation was observed under normal filtering system. The retention
of hydrophobic oil in the sintered funnel is due to the superoleophobic
nature of the nanocomposite. The permeability flux of the nanocomposite
membrane was calculated using eq 3 by recording the time taken for collection of the measured
volume of water from the oil–water mixture, and the value was
found to be 660 mL m2/h. Further, the separation efficiency
or oil rejection coefficient calculated according to eq 1 was 99% (5 min). This efficiency
value (99%) was found to be the same as calculated using eq 2 from UV–vis spectral analysis
(Figure 9e). The value
is higher than that of cellulose nanofiber aerogel (98.6%)49 and comparable to that of chitosan-based aerogel
membrane (99%).50 Furthermore, microscopic
images of the feed and the filtrate are shown in Figure 9f,g which confirmed the complete
separation. Most importantly, the recyclability of the nancomposite
membrane was examined for oil–water separation up to fourth
cycle without further loss of separation efficiency (Figure 9h). Thus, the nanocomposite-based
membrane possesses high potential to be used for the separation of
industrial oil-polluted water.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, multifunctional waterborne polyester/CD@TiO2 nanocomposite was fabricated for the first time through a
greener in situ method without using solvent and catalyst. The nanocomposite
exhibited excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Most interestingly,
multifaceted attributes like anti-icing and antifogging properties
were observed in the same nanocomposite, which is rare to achieve.
Further, this nanocomposite has the ability to be used as an anticounterfeiting
material. It is also possible to separate crude oil from water efficiently,
and this study also provides a facile and fast approach for the removal
of oil from water. Therefore, this multifunctional nanocomposite has
great potential for multifaceted advanced applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Citric
acid (Merck, Germany),
glycerol (Merck, Germany), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-200, Mn = 200 g/mol, Merck, Mumbai), and 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic
acid (bis-MPA, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) were used after drying in a
vacuum oven. Titanium butoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and poly(amido
amine) hardener (HY840, Ciba Geigy, Mumbai; amine value, 5–7
equiv/kg) were used as received. All other chemicals used in this
study were of reagent grade and used without further purification.
CD@TiO2 nanohybrid was prepared by the same hydrothermal
method as reported earlier,20 and the basic
information about CD and CD@TiO2 is provided in the Supporting Information (SI). The glycerol-based
hyperbranched epoxy was obtained by the reported method, and its important
characteristics are provided in the Supporting Information (SI).

4.2 Fabrication of Waterborne
Hyperbranched Polyester
(WHP)/CD@TiO2 Nanocomposites
WHP nanocomposites
were fabricated using nitrogen-containing CD@TiO2 through
a facile in situ method without using a catalyst, a neutralizing agent,
and an organic solvent. The fabrication of the nanocomposites was
carried out under nitrogen atmosphere at a specified temperature and
constant mechanical stirring. The first step of the fabrication process
was the prepolymer formation by the reaction of citric acid and PEG-200
at 140 °C. After cooling this reaction mixture to 60 °C,
required amounts of bis-MPA and glycerol were added into it along
with the desired amount of CD@TiO2 nanohybrid and the reaction
was carried out again at 140 °C. This nanocomposite was then
mixed homogeneously with glycerol-based hyperbranched epoxy and poly(amido
amine) in the ratio of 1:0.5:0.25 by weight at room temperature. The
mixture was coated on glass plates and mild steel plates for mechanical
testing after peeling out the cured films. The plates were cured at
150 °C for a specified time after being degassed under vacuum
for 24 h at room temperature. Then, by following the same preparative
protocol, three different nanocomposites were fabricated using 0.5,
1, and 2.5 wt % CD@TiO2 and denoted as PCTN0.5, PCTN1,
and PCTN2.5, respectively. The nanocomposites of polyester with bare
TiO2 (1 wt %) and CD (0.5 wt %)33 were also prepared for comparison purpose and coded as PTN1 and
PECD0.5, respectively.

4.3 Characterization
The fabricated nanocomposites
were characterized using different spectroscopic techniques like FTIR,
XRD, UV, TEM, etc.

4.4 Antifogging Test
Antifogging ability
of the coated films is tested by holding them at low temperature in
a cold chamber (−20 °C) for 1 h, followed by returning
to ambient conditions for the formation of moisture drops. Photographs
were then taken in each case. The transparency of the coated surface
under the fogging or frosting conditions was also evaluated to examine
the antifogging behavior of the nanocomposite films.

4.5 Anti-icing Test
The anti-icing behavior
of the nanocomposite films was tested by pouring cooled water droplets
(−15 °C) onto the chilled surfaces of the coated and bare
glass and aluminum plates using a syringe and kept under freezing
condition for 5–15 min. Photographs of the water droplets were
taken immediately.

4.6 Separation of Crude Oil
and Water from Their
Mixture
A thin film of PCTN2.5 was cast on the surface of
a normal filter paper and heated at 100 °C for 4 h in an oven.
The thickness of the film was 0.16 mm. Then, it was used for separating
crude oil and water from their mixture using suction filtering system.
Here, it is pertinent to mention that the crude oil obtained directly
from oil pool was heated with water at 70–75 °C for about
30 min and then this liquid mixture was filtered in a suction pump
using the above coated membrane. The original filter paper was also
used for the same purpose to find the difference.

The efficiency
of oil/water separation was defined as oil rejection coefficient R (%) and calculated according to the following equation51 1  where Ms and Mo are masses of initial
water and collected
water, respectively.

UV–vis analysis was carried out
to analyze the filtrate,
from which oil rejection value can be calculated using the following
equation52 2  where C0 and C are the concentrations of the feed and filtrate,
respectively.

Further, water flux of the separable membrane
was calculated using
the following equation51 3  where V is the
volume of
water that permeates through the fabricated membrane, S is the effective area of the fabricated fabric, and t is the time for complete separation.
