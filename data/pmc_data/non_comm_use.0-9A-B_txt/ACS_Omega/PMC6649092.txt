MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
have emerged as the promising molecular biomarkers
for early diagnosis and enhanced understanding of the molecular pathogenesis
of cancers as well as certain diseases. Here, a facile, label-free,
and amplification-free electrochemical biosensor was developed to
detect miRNA by using DNA origami nanostructure-supported DNA probes,
with methylene blue (MB) serving as the hybridization redox indicator,
for the first time. Specifically, the use of cross-shaped DNA origami
nanostructures containing multiple single-stranded DNA probes at preselected
locations on each DNA nanostructure could increase the accessibility
and the recognition efficiency of the probes (due to the rational
controlled density of DNA probes). The successful immobilization of
DNA origami probes and their hybridization with targeted miRNA-21
molecules was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
and cyclic voltammetry methods. A differential pulse voltammetry technique
was employed to record the oxidation peak current of MB before and
after target hybridization. The linear detection range of this biosensor
was from 0.1 pM to 10.0 nM, with a lower detection limit of 79.8 fM.
The selectivity of the miRNA biosensor was also studied by observing
the discrimination ability of single-base mismatched sequences. Because
of the larger surface area and unprecedented customizability of DNA
origami nanostructures, this strategy demonstrated great potential
for sensitive, selective, and label-free determination of miRNA for
translational biomedical research and clinical applications.

1 Introduction
MicroRNAs
(miRNAs), a group of short noncoding RNAs (∼19–23
nucleotide long), play a vital role in cell growth, gene expression,
and apoptosis.1 Recently, an increasing
number of studies have been reported in which improper miRNA expression
levels are clearly associated with the development of many diseases,
including cancers,2,3 thereby triggering research interest
in utilizing miRNAs as potential biomarkers for detecting and monitoring
various diseases. To date, a variety of methodologies have been proposed
for miRNA detection and quantification, such as quantitative polymerase
chain reaction, northern blotting, next-generation sequencing, microarrays,
and so forth.4−9 However, lack of accuracy, low efficiency, and/or excessive time
have limited the implementation of these approaches. Electrochemical
biosensors have recently emerged as a promising technique for the
rapid and easy operational detection of miRNAs.10−18 To improve the sensitivity and measured detection limits of electrochemical
miRNA biosensing, various electrode modification materials, including
carbon nanotubes,10,11 graphene,13,14 metal nanoparticles,16−19 and MoS2,20 have been incorporated
into a modification layer that enhances the electron-transfer rate
and amplifies the sensor signal.

Recently, because of the biocompatibility
and complex technologies
of electrode surface modification (via those inorganic materials),
DNA nanostructures21,22 have been considered as a biocompatible
alternative for miRNA detection processes. For example, Pei et al.
demonstrated the use of a DNA tetrahedral probe, combined with varied
amplification strategies (such as redox enzyme incorporation and hybridization
chain reaction), to detect miRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity.23−33 In this design, DNA tetrahedral nanostructures were immobilized
on the electrode surface, via the strong Au–S interaction between
three thiol-modified vertices and the gold surface. A single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) probe, protruding out from the fourth vertex, was used
to realize target recognition.23 This strategy,
which resulted in enhanced probe accessibility and reduced the effects
of surface crowding, represents a new paradigm for designing biocompatible
biosensors for clinical research and disease diagnosis. Nevertheless,
the signal amplification process required enzyme biomolecules, specialized
reagents, and multiple chemical reactions, which greatly increased
the complexity of experiments and exerted environmental limitations
on the advanced application of such biosensors. Therefore, a facile,
cost-effective, and amplification-free biosensing platform would be
highly desirable for miRNA analysis.

Over the past decade, DNA
origami has attracted extensive interest
because of its diverse structural engineering capability, large surface
area, and unprecedented customizability for precisely arranging target-binding
sites at the nanometer scale.34−36 This makes DNA origami an excellent
candidate for fabrication of biosensing systems. Herein, we have designed
a novel, label-free, and amplification-free miRNA biosensor, based
on a cross-shaped DNA origami and using methylene blue (MB) as a hybridization
redox indicator. In our design, a DNA origami was utilized, for the
first time, as the miRNA sensing platform to provide a large number
of free-standing DNA probes to capture target nucleic acids with enhanced
probe accessibility and high sensitivity. In addition, the immobilization
of DNA origami probes on a working electrode (WE) surface was realized,
via electrostatic adsorption between a cationic and biodegradable
chitosan film37,38 and negatively charged DNA origami
nanostructures. This method offers the advantage of not only providing
a simple yet stable attachment of DNA origami on an electrode surface
because of the large contact surface area of the DNA origami, but
also avoiding the use of modified thiol-DNA or biotin-DNA. With the
facile fabrication method that does not require laborious labeling,
probe immobilization, and signal amplification, our strategy promises
the aforementioned advantages in determining the concentration of
miRNA.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
and Chemicals
All chemically
synthesized DNA strands and miRNAs were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies, Inc. (www.idtdna.com), and their detailed sequences are included in the Supporting Information. The extended staple strands, serving
as a probe for miRNA recognition, were purified with denaturing PAGE,
while other staple strands were used without purification. The human
serum and all other chemicals used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and were used, as received, without further purification. 1×
TAE/Mg2+ buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl; 20 mM acetic acid; 2 mM
EDTA; 11.5 mM magnesium acetate; pH 8.0) was used for DNA origami
annealing. 10 mM of Tris-HCl, containing 1 mM EDTA buffer (pH 8.0),
was used for DNA origami immobilization. 2× saline sodium citrate
(SSC) buffer (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate, pH 8.0) was used
as a hybridization buffer, and 0.2× SSC was used as a washing
buffer. To protect miRNAs from RNase degradation, all solutions were
treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate (0.1%) before use.

2.2 Assembly of ssDNA Probe-Decorated DNA Origami
The cross-shaped
DNA origami, containing protruding ssDNA probes,
was constructed by annealing a mixture of M13mp18 viral DNA and staple
strands that included the ssDNA probe strands (1:5 molar ratio) in
1× TAE/Mg2+ buffer, from 90 to 15 °C over 12
h in a thermocycler. The DNA origami was then purified, using 100
kDa MWCO centrifugal filters purchased from Pall, Inc., to remove
excess staple strands.

2.3 Fabrication of the Modified
Electrode for
miRNA Biosensors
The bare gold electrode (3 mm in diameter)
was carefully polished to a mirror-like finish with a 0.3 and 0.05
μm alumina suspension and polishing cloth and was sonicated
for 10 min in Milli-Q water. The polished gold electrode was then
cleaned in 0.5 M sulfuric acid by an electrochemical method, with
an applied potential ranging from 0.0 to 1.5 V, until the standard
cyclic peak was observed. Finally, the mirror-finish gold electrode
was dried with nitrogen and ready for further modification.

Subsequently, the cleaned electrode was dipped into a chitosan solution
(1% chitosan solution in 1% acetic acid) to achieve a uniform surface
coating, which was then stabilized by immersing the electrode into
0.1 M NaOH, followed by air-drying. Afterward, the DNA origami (1
nM) immobilization process was carried out in the immobilization buffer
at room temperature for 4 h. Upon immobilization, the modified electrode
was gently rinsed with the 0.1 M phosphate buffer to remove unbound
origami structures and kept in the immobilization buffer for further
use.

2.4 miRNA-21 Detection
The modified electrode
containing ssDNA probes was incubated with miRNA-21 in the 2.0×
SSC hybridization buffer at room temperature for 2 h. The electrode
was then extensively washed with 0.2× SSC solution to remove
nonhybridized miRNA from the electrode surface. For the MB-binding
process, the electrode modified with miRNA/ssDNA hybrids was immersed
in MB solution [4.0 μM MB; 0.2 M NaCl; 0.1 M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)] for 5 min. The excess MB was washed thoroughly with
washing buffer to make sure that the obtained current signal was only
caused by MB bound in the sequences.

2.5 Electrochemical
Experiments
Electrochemical
measurements were performed with IVIUM CompactStat (Netherlands).
The conventional three-electrode system, composed of a modified gold
WE, a Pt mesh counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl) reference
electrode, was employed. The biosensor fabrication process and the
miRNA detection were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CV curves were performed
in 5.0 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– containing
0.1 M KCl with a scan range from −0.2 to +0.6 V. EIS experiments
were performed with a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz. All experimental
results were analyzed in terms of Randle’s equivalent circuit
model. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV) experiments were carried out at room temperature.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Mechanism of the Electrochemical
Biosensor
The working principle and electron transfer process
of the DNA
origami modified electrode are shown in Scheme 1. The precoated thin film of chitosan on
the gold electrode was used to electrostatically absorb the DNA origami
platforms, containing 10 preselected ssDNA probes by selectively extending
the staple strands (see Supporting Information for detail). The successful formation of the cross-shaped DNA origami
nanostructure was studied with an atomic force microscope (AFM), as
shown in Figure S1. When the hybrids of
the DNA probe–miRNA were formed, the MB molecules were bound
to the hybridization chain, and the corresponding oxidation peak current
of MB was directly proportional to the miRNA concentration. This relationship
can be employed in the sensitive detection of miRNA.

Scheme 1 Illustration
of a DNA Origami-Assisted Electrochemical Biosensor
for miRNA Detection
The cross-shaped DNA origami,
containing preselected ssDNA probes, was immobilized on a gold electrode
surface, via chitosan adsorption. MB molecules were used as redox
indicators to show the differences before and after miRNA hybridization.

3.2 Electrochemical Characterization
of Modified
Electrodes
EIS and CV, as effective electrochemical characterization
techniques, were employed to verify the stepwise electrode modification
process. Figure 1 shows
the EIS Nyquist plots that were recorded for each step of electrode
modification, where the semicircle portion at higher frequencies corresponds
to the electron transfer-limited process, and whose diameter is associated
to electron-transfer resistance (Ret),
and the linear portion at lower frequencies is related to the diffusion-limited
process.39,40 It can be seen that the bare gold electrode
demonstrated a very small semicircle (Ret = 1050 Ω), indicating a rapid electron transfer process of
the redox probe ([Fe(CN)6]3–/4–) on the gold electrode.

Figure 1 EIS curves of the bare gold electrode, the modification
of gold
electrode with chitosan (gold/chitosan), gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA,
and gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA/miRNA. EIS was performed in 5.0 mM
[Fe(CN)6]3–/4– containing 0.1
M KCl, with a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz.

Upon coating chitosan on the gold electrode surface
(gold/chitosan),
the Ret value was drastically increased
to 5500 Ω, indicating that the chitosan was successfully coated
on the electrode surface, which effectively hindered the negatively
charged [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– to reach
to the electrode surface. When the cross-shaped DNA origami nanostructures
(1 nM) were further added (see Figure S2 for optimization of the concentration of DNA origami platforms)
and immobilized onto gold/chitosan (defined as gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA),
the Ret value increased to 9020 Ω,
which reflected the successful immobilization of the DNA origami on
the gold/chitosan electrode surface. This increase in the Ret value could be attributed to the fact that
the negatively charged DNA origami layer on the chitosan-modified
electrode surface produced electrostatic repulsion and, thus, hindered
the electron transfer between the redox probe ([Fe(CN)6]3–/4–) and the modified electrode surface.
After hybridization of the miRNA-21 target and the gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA
probe, an even larger semicircle was observed, suggesting a further
increase in Ret (14 700 Ω)
and, thereby, a slower electron-transfer rate. This observation was
made after the formation of miRNA/ssDNA probe hybrids on the DNA origami,
which led to increased negative charges on the electrode surface and,
therefore, amplified electrostatic repulsion [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–. All EIS results demonstrated that the
miRNA biosensor had been successfully fabricated.

The EIS results
were further validated by CV measurements carried
out in 5.0 mM ([Fe(CN)6]3–/4–)
solution containing 0.1 M KCl. The CV curves provided information
regarding the electrochemical processes that happened at the electrode/solution
interface. Figure 2 illustrates the CV behavior of the redox probe [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– on the gold electrode surface before
and after each electrode modification step and the hybridization with
the miRNA-21 target. When the chitosan was coated on the electrode,
a decrease in peak current, as compared with the bare gold electrode,
was observed, indicating that the chitosan film had partially obstructed
the electron transfer. Upon immobilization of the cross-shaped DNA
origami on the gold/chitosan electrode, the current decreased more,
as a result of the negatively charged DNA backbone, as well as the
spatial blockage of origami nanostructures between [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– and the electrode surface. After
incubating with the solution of target miRNAs, the redox peak current
decreased significantly, suggesting that the recognition of the target
miRNAs with the ssDNA probes on the origami surface had reduced the
conductivity and the efficiency of electron transfer between the electrode
and redox solution. These results were in good accordance with those
observed from the EIS measurements and, therefore, confirmed the successful
fabrication of the biosensor.

CV curves were performed in 5.0 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– containing 0.1 M KCl with a scan range from −0.2 to +0.6
V.

3.3 miRNA
Detection Using MB as the Redox Indicator
To investigate
the feasibility of the proposed miRNA detection,
MB was utilized as an electrochemical indicator to monitor the hybridization
interaction with the target miRNA. It has been demonstrated that the
MB, a phenothiazine dye, can exhibit different binding affinities
for ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) because MB can bind with
ssDNA through the electrostatic interaction, while the effect of intercalations
and electrostatic interactions coexist between MB and dsDNA.41 These differences, therefore, lead to different
electrochemical responses upon MB interacting with ssDNA and dsDNA.42−44Figure 3A presents
the LSV curves of gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA and gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA/miRNA
after incubation with MB in PBS solution containing 0.1 M KCl. When
the target miRNA-21 was absent, a peak current was observed at 3.99
μA (red). However, the peak current greatly increased to 6.72
μA, after hybridization of the gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA probe
with the miRNA-21 (green). This increase in electrochemical response
indicated that more MB molecules were absorbed on the probe surface,
which strongly supported the existence of ssDNA/miRNA hybrids on the
electrode surface. This result was consistent with the previous studies.45,46 In addition, the effect of the scan rate on the CV responses of
the MB on the fabricated electrode before and after miRNA target hybridization
was investigated. As presented in Figure 3B, in both cases, the plots of the anodic
and cathodic peak currents (Ipa and Ipc) against the scan rate (v) exhibit a linear relationship in the range of 0.05–1.0 V
s–1, suggesting a surface-confined electrode process.
Based on the slope of the curve of Ip versus v, the surface coverage of electroactive MB (ΓMB) on the electrode surface can be estimated using eq 1(47) 1  where F is Faraday’s
constant (96 485 C mol–1), n is the number of electrons transferred (n = 2 for
MB), A is the area of the electrode (cm2), Γ is the surface coverage, v is the scan
rate (V s–1), R is the gas constant
(8.314 J K–1 mol–1), and T is the temperature. From the slope of Ipc versus v shown in Figure 3B, the calculated ΓMB for the gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA/miRNA was 918.9 pmol/cm2, which is, as expected, much higher than that for the gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA
(213.1 pmol/cm2). This indicates that more MB could bind
to miRNA/ssDNA probe duplexes, facilitating the electron transfer
from the MB molecules to the electrode. Therefore, these results confirm
that this miRNA biosensor is suitable for detection of miRNA, according
to the reduction response of MB.

ssDNA and miRNA/ssDNA (B). Ipa1 and Ipc1 are for gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA/miRNA
and Ipa2 and Ipc2 are for gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA.

3.4 Sensitivity and Selectivity of the miRNA Analysis
To investigate the detectable efficiency of the proposed gold/chitosan/origami-ssDNA
biosensor, a sensitivity study was conducted via DPV measurements
at various concentrations of the target miRNA-21. As illustrated in Figure 4A, the oxidation
currents of MB noticeably increased with an increase in the miRNA-21
concentrations. The resulting logarithmic plot of miRNA-21 concentrations
versus MB oxidation currents, as shown in Figure 4B, exhibits a good linear relationship over
a range of 100 fM to 10 nM, with a regression equation of ΔI (μA) = 1.3702 log C + 18.084 (n = 3), where ΔI represents the oxidation
current difference between the presence and absence of the miRNA-21
target, and C denotes the concentration of miRNA-21.
The detection limit of the proposed biosensor was estimated to be
as low as 79.8 fM, based on the equation 3σ/a, where “σ” is the standard deviation, and “a” is the slope of the linear regression. This relatively
wide measuring range and lower detection limit indicated that the
fabricated miRNA-21 biosensor, based on a cross-shaped DNA nanostructure
and coupled with MB as a hybridization redox indicator, can be prepared
for miRNA-21 assays.

of
miRNA (A), the relationship between ΔI and
logarithm of miRNA-21 concentration (B), and selectivity of the proposed
biosensor for the detection of target and mismatch miRNA (C).

Furthermore, the DNA origami-based
electrochemical biosensor presents
a facile and cost-effective detection strategy as compared to using
complex multistep fabrication and expensive enzymes (see Table 1). In addition, it
was noted that the background noise of the ssDNA probe was relatively
high due to the binding interaction between MB and DNA origami platforms
(Figure S3). In order to decrease the background
noise and improve the detection limitation of the miRNA biosensor,
optimization of the structural design of the DNA origami platform
and the density of ssDNA probes are needed.

In addition, the selectivity of the developed miRNA-21
biosensor
was examined by comparing the DPV’s current response of the
target miRNA-21 with that of a noncomplementary miRNA (miRNA-192),
and single-base mismatched sequences including at terminal position
(SM-T) and middle position (SM-M) under the same conditions. As can
be seen in Figure 4C, the peak current variation (ΔI) of the
complementary miRNA-21 is much higher than that of the noncomplementary
miRNA-192 sequence, SM-T, and SM-M. These results confirmed that this
constructed biosensor had good specificity and could distinguish the
target miRNA-21 from single-mismatched sequences and other analogous
interferences.

3.5 miRNA-21 Analysis in Human
Serum
Human biological fluids contain many species interfering
with sensitive
miRNA analysis. In this study, human serum was utilized as real biological
samples for target miRNA-21 detection. Three concentrations of miRNA-21
(1, 10, and 1000 pM) spiked into 1% human serum were tested by the
developed biosensor. The resulted relative standard deviation (RSD)
and percentage of recovery are calculated and listed in Table 2. For every concentration of
miRNA-21 in human serum, the recovery percentage was in nearly quantitative
yield with low RSD, indicating that the DNA origami-based biosensor
is a good analytical tool in miRNA assay, which possesses excellent
practical application in cancer clinics and diagnosis.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated a label-free
and amplification-free
electrochemical biosensor, based on cross-shaped DNA origami nanostructures,
for miRNA-21 detection. This was coupled with MB as a hybridization
redox indicator. Instead of using covalent immobilization of DNA nanostructures
on gold electrodes, via thiol–Au interactions, the physical
absorption of DNA origami by the chitosan film was utilized for the
first time. The stable and effective immobilization of the DNA origami
was confirmed by EIS and CV experiments. The electrochemical signal
of the DNA biosensor originated from the different responses of the
MB molecules that were bound with ssDNA and the hybridization of miRNA/DNA.
The fabrication method of this biosensor was simple and highly sensitive,
with a 79.8 fM detection limit of miRNA by using the DPV method. In
addition, the free-standing ssDNA probes that were supported by the
DNA origami not only enhanced probe accessibility but also provided
a possibility of detecting multiple targets and larger molecules (proteins,
virus, and aptamers) because of the rationally controlled number and
density of DNA probes on the DNA origami surface. Furthermore, the
biosensor is effective to distinguish single-base mismatched sequences
from target miRNA-21, as well as exhibits satisfactory performance
in human serum, indicating its great potential for application in
disease diagnosis and assessment.
