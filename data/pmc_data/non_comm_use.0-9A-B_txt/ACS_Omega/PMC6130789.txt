Developing targeted delivery nanosystems
for delivering chemotherapeutic
anticancer drugs specifically to cancerous tissues with improvement
in the specificity of drugs for different cancer cells can result
in high therapeutic efficacy and low toxicity in healthy tissues.
Herein, we proposed the synthesis of a multifunctional nanodelivery
system, folic acid (FA) decorating nanographene oxide (nGO) functionalized
with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), called pGO-FA, with good biocompatibility
and good delivering performance of a hydrophobic water-insoluble anticancer
drug of paclitaxel (PTX). 4-br-PEG-NH2, FA, and PTX were
attached to PEG-functionalized nGO (pGO) through a combined chemical
and physical force to form a nanosized complex, pGO-FA-PTX, defined
as the nanodrug system. WST-8 assay in vitro illustrated that pGO-FA-PTX
inhibited A2780 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Cell viability
was kept high to 60% when treated with 200 nM of free PTX. However,
pGO-FA-PTX with the same dose of PTX (cell viability less than 30%)
had double the cytotoxicity effect compared to free PTX. Furthermore,
fluorescence observation demonstrated that pGO-FA-PTX exhibited an
improved efficiency in killing A2780 cells due to the special affinity
between FA and FA receptor, which has high expression in cancer cells.
The strategy and method used in this study could be effective in improving
both the bioavailability of PTX and therapy efficiency.

Introduction
Cancer is one kind of disease that results
in several millions
of deaths every year.1 Chemotherapy plays
a vital role among current treatment methods.2 However, free drug chemotherapy has several limitations, such as
nonspecific selectivity to cancerous tissues, poor water solubility
of drugs, low local therapeutic concentration, and side effects to
normal healthy cells.3,4 To tackle these limitations, nanodelivery
systems (NDS’s)1 including polymer
nanoparticles,5 mesoporous silica nanoparticles,6 liposomes,7 microspheres,8 and inorganic materials9 have been developed as anticancer drug carriers. On the account
of these NDS, drugs can be directly conveyed into targeted cancer
cells by connecting with target molecules and released under controlled
conditions.10 Nevertheless, the therapeutic
efficiency of NDS is still unsatisfied owing to the low loading capacity
and loading efficiency.11 These challenges
have driven the further development of drug delivery complexes.1,12

Paclitaxel (PTX) is a commonly used potent chemotherapy drug
that
shows high cytotoxicity to cancer cells.3,12,13 PTX was considered as the most significant progress
in tumor chemotherapy in recent decades by the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) since its extraction from Taxus brevifolia.14,15 However, the poor water solubility and poor
bioavailability limited the clinical application of PTX.14

Graphene oxide (GO), a kind of famous
two-dimensional (2D) advanced
material, exhibited some remarkable biological and physical properties,
such as excellent biocompatibility and solubility, super-structural
stability, high drug loading amount, and controlled drug release behavior.16−19 These advantages allowed GO to be a biological vector for medical
imaging and drug delivery.20 The existence
of oxygen-rich groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy groups
at the surface enabled the stable GO suspension in pure water. However,
GO will aggregate in ionic solutions that are rich in different kinds
of salts or peptides and proteins, such as the normal cell medium
and serum.20 Furthermore, cytotoxicity
tests have shown that GO exhibited a certain toxicity to cells and
tissues, whereas well-functionalized GO with surface coated by polymers
with biocompatibility was not obviously toxic at the tested doses.21,22 Therefore, the modification of GO through covalent or noncovalent
functionalization, specifically, covalent grafting of polymers onto
GO sheets, can be a promising step for biomedical applications.16,23,24

Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
is an efficient polymer in biology
due to its biocompatibility, slightest toxicity, protein resistance,
and good solubility in water or other common solvents.11,15,25,26 The combination of PEG with other polymers or nanoparticles can
effectively improve their biocompatibility.25,27,28 The surface modification of nanoparticles
with PEG has been widely employed in drug delivery systems.11,14 Moreover, for amino-functionalized linear polymer molecules of PEG-NH2, fraction of alkyl chain connect to the surface, the other
section available to the interior decorating, and then long PEG brushes
can be formed on the carriers. Also, PEG-NH2 is a very
important surface functional material with many advantages, such as
good hydrophilic properties, biocompatibility, and low costs, very
similar to PEG.29

Therefore, PEGylation
of graphene oxide can act as a desired carrier
for delivering hydrophobic anticancer drugs. In a previous report,
Liu et al., for the first time, synthesized and functionalized nanographene
oxide (nGO) sheets with PEG-NH2 to improve the aqueous
solubility and dispersion stability of nGO in some physiological solutions.
This functionalization also keeps the unique ability of nGO in the
loading and delivery of aromatic, water-insoluble drugs, a camptothecin
analogue (SN38), by physisorption.20 After
that, Xu et al. reported the chemically and physically loaded PTX
onto the GO-PEG nanocarrier to afford a nanosized complex, GO-PEG/PTX
and GO-PEG-PTX.14 These studies explored
the potential application of GO-PEG in biomedicine.3,17

The creation of specific target and the elimination or illumination
of damaged cancer tissues require careful controlling of the shape,
size, surface coating, and surface functionality of the NDS.1,30,31 It is important to design the
experimental parameters that must be helpful to produce nanodelivery
systems that can keep its function but overcome the biological barriers.32,33 Thus, targeting moieties or ligands should be chosen based on their
physical properties against tumor cell specific receptors, their binding
properties onto the particulate carriers, and their remaining functionally
activities.6 Among them, folic acid (FA),
as a target molecule, was extensively applied in target cancer treatments
study.10,34−36 The folate receptor
(FR) with a high selective affinity for FA can be overexpressed on
the outside cell membrane of many cancer tissues.36 In doing so, the attachment of FA and PEG-NH2 onto the surface of GO can improve the transportation performance
of nanocomplex into the FR-positive cancer cells through reasonable
targeting.

Physical adsorption and chemical bonding of cancer
therapy drugs
to nanodelivery carriers involving drugs on the internal or external
surfaces are described during the formation of different functionalities.8,37,38 In this paper, we proposed new
GO-based drug delivery systems, as shown in Scheme 1, for cancer therapy with improved utilization
rate of PTX.

Scheme 1 Procedure of the Preparation of pGO-FA-PTX Nanodrug
Delivery Systems
The nanocarrier of GO was prepared first by a modified
Hummer’s
method and then surface grafted by biocompatible 4-armed starlike
PEG-NH2 to render the aqueous stability and biocompatibility
(called pGO). Next, folic acid (FA) was chemically reacted with pGO
through amidation, successfully introducing a target recognition (called
pGO-FA). Finally, PTX was physically and chemically loaded onto the
pGO-FA nanocarrier to form a nanosized complex, pGO-FA-PTX. The successful
functionalization of GO was verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM),
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, Raman spectroscopy, and
ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometry (UV–vis).

Ovarian
cancer is the most deadly cancer because of lack of early
detection and effective therapy methods for late stage.39 Evaluating the tumor models of A2780 cell line
of human ovarian cancer tissue from an untreated patient is an important
part of the drug discovery.40 The derived
nanocomplex could be efficiently taken up by cell line A2780 from
the intracellular imaging. There is evidence that platinum-based chemodrugs
and PTX can be given safely for cancer patients. But PTX is commercially
available and active.41 It was found from
cell viability assay that pGO-FA-PTX could be an effective potential
killer of cancer cells with a higher cytotoxicity to A2780 cells in
vitro compared to free PTX. This proposed method could significantly
improve the bioavailability of PTX and other hydrophobic drugs. The
complex forces between the drug and carrier can give extend effective
duration via controlled slow release.

Results and Discussion
Water-soluble drug carrier of nGO was produced by a modified Hummer’s
method followed by high-power sonication.18,42 The morphology of GO before surface modification was revealed by
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) studies.45 As shown in Figure 1a,b, dried nGO sheets stacked onto each other
and formed thicker sheets owing to the interlayer π–π
interactions. It exhibited hundreds of nanometers lateral size and
layered structure. Additionally, the morphology of nGO were also observed
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Figure 1c,d, which showed a smooth
and naked nGO surface with many silk-like wrinkles, and the lateral
size is around 100 nm, which is very similar to that of the nGO used
to penetrate into the cells.46

Figure 1 Morphology
characterization of the nanodrug carriers of nGO: (a,
b) FESEM images of nGO and (c, d) TEM images of nGO (the arrows help
recognizing the edges of the nGO sheets).

To further characterize the 2D and three-dimensional (3D)
surface
morphologies, as well as the thickness of the nGO, AFM measurements
were conducted. Sonication treatment was effective to disperse nGO
nanosheets with the thickness of about 1.2 and 50–250 nm in
lateral width, indicating two- or three-layer sheets (Figure 2a,b), facilitating their entrance
into the cells.18,26

(a) AFM image of
the as-synthesized nGO nanosheets; (b) height profiles of line scannings;
(c) Raman spectrum; and (d) X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the
nGO nanodrug carriers.

Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive characterization method
to discover the ordered graphic or disordered crystal structures of
carbon. As shown in Figure 2c, the G band of Raman spectrum of nGO was broadened and shifted
upward to 1590 cm–1 due to stress. Concurrently,
the intensity of the D band at 1360 cm–1 increased
substantially, indicating the size decrease of the in-plane sp2 domains because of the ultrasonic exfoliation and strong
oxidation. The XRD pattern of nGO is also shown in Figure 2d. The (002) peak can be observed
at 10.2° of the 2θ value, indicating that the interlayer
distances of the nGO was about 1.05 nm.47

In this drug delivery system, PEG-modified nGO was used as
a drug
carrier with the aim to enhance biocompatibility. FA was used as targeting
moieties and PTX was chosen as a model drug. The preparation process
of the nanosized pGO-FA/PTX complex is shown in Scheme 1.

The FT-IR spectra of nGO, nGO-COOH,
PEG-NH2, and pGO
are shown in Figure 3a, wherein the peaks at 1622 and 1730 cm–1 were
ascribed to the main structure of graphene of C–C=C
and C=O stretching vibrations, respectively. After coating
with 4-br-PEG-NH2, the weakening of epoxy groups (C–O–C)
at 1050 cm–1 and carboxylic group (C=O) bands
at 1730 cm–1 clearly indicated successful chemical
grafting.15 Furthermore, three new characteristic
peaks at 1643 cm–1 (−CONH amide band I),
1569 cm–1 (−NH amide band II), and 1005 cm–1 (C–N stretching vibration) appeared, confirming
the binding of 4-br-PEG-NH2 chains onto the nGO surface.
Meanwhile, another two strong peaks at 2870 cm–1 (−CH2−) and 1405 cm–1 (−C–O−) also definitely illustrated the existence
of PEG chains on the surface of nGO sheets, which can contribute to
the enhancement of biocompatibility. As shown in Figure 3b and Table 1, the Raman spectra and intensity ratio (ID/IG) of the modified
nGO exhibited similar results, indicating there was little change
in the defects and edges during the modification processes.

Figure 3 Modification
of nGO with chloroacetic acid and PEG-NH2: (a) FT-IR spectra
of nGO samples modified with chloroacetic acid
and PEG-NH2 and (b) the Raman spectra of the modified nGO
samples.

As shown in Figure 4a, after functionalized by FA, the new characteristic
peaks at 1000−1600
cm−1 appeared on pGO-FA, indicating the existence
of benzene groups, suggesting that FA connected onto pGO surface.
To further confirm the modification, the UV absorbance spectra of
pGO before and after loading FA and PTX were recorded. As shown in Figure 4b, the UV absorbance
spectrum of pGO showed a sharp absorption peak at 225 nm in the range
of 200–400 nm. However, the sharp absorption peaks moved to
a higher wavelength in the UV absorbance spectrum of pGO-FA, indicating
the successful binding of FA. After mixing with PTX, the spectrum
showed that sharp absorption peaks at 226, 254, and 336 nm originated
from PTX with a characteristic peak at 229 nm, further verifying the
successful loading of PTX to pGO-FA.

Figure 4 Structure characterization of the nanodrug
systems decorated with
FA and PTX: (a) FT-IR spectra of pGO before and after loading with
FA and (b) the UV–vis absorbance spectra of pGO before and
after loading with FA and PTX.

This phenomenon was also observed in the absorbance of the
pGO
and the decorated pGO suspension prepared in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) after 24 h. The samples of pGO were suspended homogeneously
in PBS, with an absorption peak at 230 nm, indicating that PEG-NH2 increased the solubility of nanocarriers in PBS.15

As we know, many anticancer drugs such
as PTX are aromatic and
hydrophobic. Owing to their poor water solubility, the clinical applications
are obviously limited. Herein, we chose PTX as a model drug to form
pGO-FA-PTX nanocomplex for increasing the utilization rate of PTX.

The loading of PTX on pGO-FA was achieved by directly mixing PTX
(dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) with pGO-FA aqueous suspension.
The unbound or undissolved PTX was removed by centrifugation and filtration.
The successful loading of PTX on pGO-FA was evidenced by the newly
appeared characteristic absorption peak at 229 nm (originating from
PTX) in the UV–vis absorbance spectrum (Figure 4b). As previously stated, drug cannot be
loaded on PEG in a solution free of nGO; therefore, PTX loading was
all attributed to the incorporation of nGO. However, there is a little
amount of PTX decorated by covalent linking. Due to the lack of chemical
reaction between PTX and pGO, physical adsorption of PTX could preserve
its biological activity in comparison with the drug loading on the
carrier via a covalent bond.

To further characterize the thickness,
the average size, and the
size distribution of the functional pGO sheets and drug-decorated
samples, AFM characterization was conducted.18 The AFM images, shown in Figure 5a, revealed that pGO presented a small increase in
thickness from 1.2 to 1.6 nm. The 2D GO sheets with 40–200
nm of lateral dimension were a little smaller than nGO. These changes,
compared to the interlayer spacing (1.2 nm) and size distribution
of 50–250 nm in the parent GO, were caused by the decoration
of 4-br-PEG-NH2 and the ultrasonication during the process.48

a1) AFM image of pGO (nGO modified with 4-br-PEG-NH2), (a2) height profiles of line scannings in (a1); (b, b1) AFM image of pGO modified by FA and
(b2) height profiles of line scannings in (b1); and
(c, c1) AFM image of pGO-FA loaded with PTX and (c2) height profiles of line scannings in (c1).

After being decorated by the target
molecule, FA, as shown in Figure 5b, the pGO sheets
were of ∼2.5 nm thickness and their lateral dimension was decreased,
which may be caused by the modification and ultrasonication process.
The pGO sheets were covered with FA on the both sides, indicating
that FA had an average decorating thickness of ∼1.0 nm. After
loading with PTX (Figure 5c), the thickness of the layer and roughness on the layer
were further increased. The relatively high density of peaks shown
in the 3D morphology photos clearly indicated the high loading capacity
of PTX.

Cell Cytotoxicity
To investigate the cell cytotoxicity,
blank carriers were examined firstly. pGO and pGO-FA were directly
incubated with A2780 cells for 48 h in a 37 °C incubator. Then,
a CCK-8 assay was used to examine the viability of A2780 cells. The
result showed no significant decrease in cell viability (Figure 6), indicating that
our as-synthesized nanocarrier had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility.

Figure 6 Cytotoxicity
of different concentrations of pGO and pGO-FA on A2780
cells at 48 h treatment time. Error bars were based on triplet samples.

As shown in Figure 7, PTX had a dose-dependent (0–200
nM) cell inhibition effect
on A2780 cells. Cell viability was kept high at 60% when treated with
200 nM of free PTX. However, pGO-FA-PTX with the same dose of PTX
exhibited more significant cytotoxicity (cell viability less than
30%, 2 times lower than that of free PTX) toward A2780 cells than
free PTX. That should be attributed to the nanocarriers, pGO-FA, with
good biocompatibility, appropriate size, and target recognition, all
of which made it more effective to deliver a number of drugs to perform
a noticeable therapeutic effect.

Figure 7 Cytotoxicity of different concentrations
of free PTX and pGO-FA-PTX
(at the same concentration of PTX) on A2780 cells (error bars are
based on triplet samples).

Cellular cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs was then evaluated
by
fluorescence microscopy after incubation of A2780 cells with different
concentrations of free drugs, or nanocomplexes. Then, the nuclei of
A2780 cells were stained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).34 We can clearly observe the blue fluorescence
in the cells after incubating for 24 h (Figure 8). As the drug concentration increases, the
fluorescence intensity gradually decreases, indicating that the number
of living cells was decreased slowly and the drugs or nanohybrids
could be introduced into A2780 cells.

Figure 8 Fluorescent microscopy images showing
the cell cytotoxicity of
free PTX (A1: control; A2: 1 nmol/L; A3: 5 nmol/L; A4: 10 nmol/L;
A5: 50 nmol/L; A6: 100 nmol/L) and pGO-FA-PTX (B1: control; B2: 1
nmol/L; B3: 5 nmol/L; B4: 10 nmol/L; B5: 50 nmol/L; B6: 100 nmol/L)
by A2780 cells (at the same concentration of PTX) for 24 h.

Compared with the free PTX-treated
groups, the weaker fluorescence
signal of DAPI was observed in the pGO-FA-PTX groups with the same
PTX equivalent concentrations, illustrating that pGO-FA as a carrier
could enter the cells and locate in the nuclei with high efficiency
due to the special affinity interaction between FA and FA receptor
overexpression in cancer cells. This experiment strongly suggests
specific cytotoxicity of pGO-FA-PTX by A2780 cells, and that pGO-FA-PTX
nanosystems can effectively deliver drugs to the target tumor cells.

As shown in Figure 9, the large π-conjugated structure of nGO can form a π–π
stacking interaction with these aromatic drugs and the two planes
of nGO can both adsorb aromatic compounds, suggesting their potential
application as drug carriers. Also, because there are many active
amine groups on pGO, PTX can react with the groups on pGO and induce
covalent immobilization. Moreover, recent reports declared that 2D
shape and ultrasmall size of PEGylated graphene sheets had promising
drug delivery properties, not only the highly efficient passive tumor
targeting performance but also the relatively low retention in reticuloendothelial
systems.

Figure 9 Schematic illustrate of pGO-FA-PTX as a functional drug delivery
system for targeted therapy of human ovarian cancer cell line A2780.

Conclusions
In
this work, we reported the synthesis of the nanocarrier with
good biocompatibility and good delivering performance of a water-insoluble
anticancer drug of PTX. pGO and pGO-FA nanocarriers were proved to
be nontoxic even at concentrations as high as 300 μg/mL practically,
and the pGO-FA-PTX nanocomplex was found to be highly cytotoxicity
to human ovarian cancer cell line A2780 in vitro as evaluated by WST-8
assay. The pGO-FA-PTX inhibited A2780 cells in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner and had a 2 times higher cytotoxicity effect
compared to free PTX, especially at lower concentration and shorter
time, for improving the bioavailability of PTX. Furthermore, fluorescence
observation demonstrated that pGO-FA-PTX killed A2780 cells more effectively.
The special affinity interaction between FA and FA receptor exhibited
the overexpression in cancer cells. The prepared multifunctional pGO-FA-PTX
would be a promising tumor theranostic agent for clinical application.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The 4-arm PEG-NH2 (99%) was purchased
from SINOPEG Biotech Co., Ltd. (Xiamen, China). Folic acid (FA, 99%),
paclitaxel (PTX, 99%), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl-N′-ethylcarbodiimide) hydrochloride (EDC, 99%), 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (99%), and hydroxy-2,
5-dioxopyrrolidine-3-sulfonic acid sodium salt (NHS, 99%) were purchased
from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai, China). The human ovarian cancer cell
line A2780 was provided by Jiangsu Innovation Center for Industrial
Biotechnology. All of the other chemicals were of analytical grade
and directly used without further purification.

Synthesis of
nGO and pGO
The sample of nGO was prepared
with natural graphite powder following a modified Hummer’s
method.42,43 To attach the PEG-NH2, carboxylic
acid functional groups were induced, as reported by our group before.20

Preparation of pGO-FA Nanohybrids
The targeting drug
delivery system, pGO-FA, was developed by coupling of FA and pGO with
an amide bond.34 Briefly, EDC (192 mg)
and NHS (54.25 mg) were added slowly to the pGO suspension as described
in ref (14). Then,
FA (146.6 mg) was added to the dispersion and the reaction was incubated
overnight, yielding a pGO-FA solution, followed by filtration and
water washing.

Loading of PTX on pGO-FA
To load
PTX onto the pGO-FA
sheets, PTX needed to be modified by succinic anhydride according
to the literature.14,44 First, PTX was modified by adding
a carboxyl acid group on the molecule. The loading efficiency of PTX
on the carrier of pGO was approximately 18.7%, obtained from UV–vis
spectroscopy. Then, the modified PTX (contain 12.5 mg of PTX dissolved
in pyridine 200 μL) was introduced to pGO-FA by amidation and
physical absorption in the presence of EDC and NHS as described in Synthesis of nGO and pGO.

Cells Culture
Human ovarian cancer cell line A2780
was bought and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 and relative
humidity of 90% atmosphere. The cells were adherent to the culture
medium.

Cell Viability Assay
Human ovarian cancer cell line
A2780 was plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well in 100 μL of culture medium and added
with different concentrations of pGO-FA, pGO-FA-PTX, and free PTX
(dissolved in DMSO and diluted in PBS). The relative cell viability
was measured by WST assay using CCK-8 kit. After treatment for 48
h, the absorbance of each well was measured at the wavelength of 450
nm, using a Tecan GENios Pro microplate reader.

DAPI Staining
Analysis
A2780 cells were cultured with
same concentrations of free PTX and pGO-FA-PTX for 2–200 nmol/L
as described in ref (14), then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min, and
stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 2 μg/mL),
a DNA-specific fluorescent dye, at 37 °C for 10 min. The stained
cells were imaged under a fluorescence microscope.

Characterization
The structure of the samples was characterized
by Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Scientific, Irvine, CA), Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR, PerkinElmer, Spectrum BX II, Waltham, MA) spectroscopy,
atomic force microscopy (AFM, CP-Research, Bruker, Billerica, MA),
and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8, Cu Kα radiation).
Sample morphology and nanostructure were observed by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800, Tokyo, Japan)
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Philips
Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN, Philips Innovation Services, Andover, MA), respectively.
Ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometry (UV–vis, Evolution
260 Bio, Thermo) was used to observe the maximum absorption peak.
Fluorescence spectrophotometry (F-7000, Hitachi) was applied to characterize
cell cytotoxicity of the complexes.
