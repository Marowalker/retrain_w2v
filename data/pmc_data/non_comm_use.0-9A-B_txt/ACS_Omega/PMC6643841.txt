As in supramolecular
chemistry, complexity could also be achieved
through a bottom-up approach. Anthocyanins and related compounds such

kinetics of the system. A beautiful pH-dependent palette of colors
is obtained, including a blue flavylium cation at unusually high pH

aspect for explaining the details of the spiro opening kinetics. The

Introduction
Complexity is a necessary
requirement in biological systems. Complexity
can be achieved through a bottom-up approach, as in supramolecular
chemistry, or by a multistate of chemical species reversibly interconverted
by external stimuli, such as pH and light. We coined this last concept
as molecular metamorphosis.1 While in supramolecular
chemistry the complexity results from the higher dimension and diversity
of the building blocks, in metamorphosis it is the number of species
that gives the complexity. Anthocyanins and related compounds are
a paradigm of metamorphosis. Anthocyanins are the molecules that give
most of the red, purple, and blue colors of flowers and fruits. In
particular, the blue color is the most intriguing one because anthocyanins
in vitro only exhibit blue color in transient situations and at equilibrium
have a very small percentage of the blue quinoidal base and the colorless
hemiketal is the dominant species. Moreover, the intense blue ionized
quinoidal base is not stable in common anthocyanins.2

The study of the thermodynamics and kinetics of anthocyanins
and
related compounds is a fundamental research necessary to understand
the expression of color in plants and their benefits in human health.
Besides these fundamental aspects, anthocyanins, and related compounds
have great potential as food colorants, in photochromic systems, write–read–erase
cycles, including models for optical memories.3

The strategy used by nature to produce blue color from anthocyanins
is the stabilization of the quinoidal bases (neutral and monoionized), Scheme 1.4 In the flower of Commelina communis, the blue color is achieved by stabilizing the ionized quinoidal
base through a metaloanthocyanin that consists in a supramolecular
structure of anthocyanin/flavone/metal in a ratio 6:6:2, Scheme 2a.5 Another alternative used by nature to get blue color is
the acylation of the anthocyanins’ sugars. In the case of the
heavenly blue anthocyanin there are three acylated sugar units leading
to a π–π stacking around positions 2 and 4 of the
flavylium core preventing in this way the hydration reaction, Scheme 2b.6

Scheme 2 Two Main Strategies of Nature To Get the Blue Color:
(a) Metaloanthocyanins;
(b) π–π Stacking with Acylated Sugars
Adapted from ref (4).

The synthetic strategies to prepare blue flavylium derivatives
have followed two vectors: (i) the use of amino substituents, (ii)
introduction of a double bond between ring C and ring B, to get the
so called styrylflavylium compounds.7

In recent years, we have investigated some 2,6-bis(arylidene)cyclohexanones,
from which it is possible to obtain the respective styrylflavylium
cation at low pH values.8,9 These molecules are
considered as curcumin analogs10 and their
biologic activity has been very intensively studied.11 In this work, the compound (E)-6-(dimethylamino)-4-(4-(dimethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzylidene)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxanthylium
chloride, henceforth named 1, Scheme 3 (AH+), bearing two dimethylamino
substituents in positions 7 and 4′ was prepared. The multistate
of species of 2,6-bis(arylidene)cyclohexanones is very similar to
the one of anthocyanins with the particularity that a new and interesting
species that we identify by the name spiro, Scheme 3, is formed. In compound 1,
it is possible to have cis–trans isomers in the pendent arm although in this compound we did not
find any evidence for the cis isomers.

Scheme 3 General
Kinetic Scheme for Compound 1
Through
this work we did not
find any experimental evidence for the cis analogs
obtained from isomerization of the pendent arm. More species are obtained
at higher pH values, by deprotonation of the hydroxyl substituents.

One characteristic of the anthocyanins and related
compounds is
the dramatic influence of the position and nature of the substituents
on the pH-dependent mole fraction distribution of the multistate species.
This fact has crucial implications on the pH-dependent color of these
compounds and also on the identification of all the species that are
responsible for the biological activity.3 Moreover, other chemical species can additionally be present in
some specific cases as, for example, the flavanones in 2′-hydroxyflavylium
compounds12 and, as mentioned above, the
spiro in 2,6-bis(2-hydroxibenziliden)cyclohexanones.8,9

In the next paragraph, the state of the art regarding the
complex
multistate of species of anthocyanins and related compounds will be
summarized, to provide insight on the comprehension of the behavior
of compound 1. The studies carried out during the eighties
of the last century by McClelland in synthetic flavylium13 and Brouillard in anthocyanins,14 paved the way to the actual knowledge of the thermodynamic
and kinetic properties of these compounds. Flavylium cation is the
stable species at low pH values, because the back reactions that give
flavylium cation from hemiketal (B) and from quinoidal base (A) are
of second order and proportional to the proton concentration, Scheme 1. Raising the pH,
the neutral species are formed (as in Scheme 1) but in basic medium ionized analogs are
obtained from the deprotonation of the hydroxyl substituents.

The most convenient way to study the multistate of species of these
systems is to perform direct and reverse pH jumps defined, respectively
by the addition of base to solutions equilibrated at lower pH values
(usually from flavylium cation at pH ≤ 1) and addition of acid
to solutions equilibrated at higher pH values.

Some years ago,
we introduced the energy level diagram for anthocyanins
and related compounds in acidic medium,15Scheme 4, and more
recently extended it to the basic medium,16 see below. In such type of diagrams the energy level of several
components is positioned, provided that the equilibrium constants
(K) are calculated ΔG°
= −RT ln K.a After a direct pH jump to sufficiently high pH values the
quinoidal base is formed during the mixing time of the stopped flow.
These two species (flavylium cation and quinoidal base) remain in
equilibrium during the subsequent kinetic processes that are much
slower. As shown in Scheme 4 the next step (2nd) is the hydration reaction (min) followed
by the ring-opening of the hemiketal (ms) which is faster. By consequence,
the second kinetic step is controlled by the hydration reaction. Finally,
the system equilibrates through the isomerization that gives rise
to a relatively small mole fraction of Ct, a process which usually
takes a few hours, or even days.

Scheme 4 Three Distinct Kinetic Processes Occurring
in Anthocyanins and Related
Compounds, after a Direct pH Jump
In spite of the complexity of the anthocyanins multistate
of species
it can be reduced to a polyprotic system as shown in eqs 1–6. 1   2   3  where 4   5   6  

Pseudo-Equilibrium
When the cis–trans isomerization is slow,
it is possible to define a
transient state before formation of significant amounts of trans-chalcones, where all multistate species are in (pseudo-equilibrium).
The following equations account for this state 7   8   9  where 10   11   12  

Results and Discussion
Question
of the Amine Protonation
The pH dependent
absorption spectra of compound 1 taken circa 1 min after
direct pH jumps are shown in Figure 1. The system is equivalent to a single diprotic acid
with pKa1 = 1.9 and pKa2 = 7.5.

(a) pH dependent absorption spectra circa 1 min after a direct pH
jump followed by a common spectrophotometer, ∼0.2 < pH <
5.4; (b) the same for 6.0 < pH < 12.3; (c) fitting was achieved
for a diprotic system with pKa1 = 1.9
and pKa2 = 7.5.

In synthetic flavylium compounds bearing amino substituents
it
was verified that the amino group can protonate at extremely high
concentrations of proton in the range 1 M < pH < 6 M.17 In the present compound, the absorption spectrum
changes up to [H+] = 0.6 M and remains the same for higher
proton concentrations, Figure 1a. This result can be explained with two alternative hypotheses:
(i) the dimethylamino group of flavylium cation does not protonate
under extremely acidic solutions; (ii) the absorption spectrum at
0.6 M corresponds to the protonated flavylium and the “normal”
flavylium cation is the species observed at pH = 5.4 in Figure 1a. The fact that 1 has two donor amino substituents supports the second argument. Regardless
of which amine is protonated (in principle the one in position 4′
should protonate first because it is more distant from the pyrylium
positive charge, Scheme 3), the presence of the other amino group (in position 7) renders
its protonation easier (taking place at less acidic pHs) because of
the delocalization of the positive charge. The first inflection point
at pH = 1.9 in Figure 1a reflects the protonation equilibrium of the amine in the flavylium
cation. Therefore, the other inflection point at pH = 7.5, is equivalent
to the pseudo-equilibrium defined in anthocyanins by eq 7, the state where AH+ equilibrates with all the other neutral species, except the trans-chalcone. Equations 13–17 account for the pseudo-equilibrium
in 1. In eq 16 the spiro form, SP, was also included. The spiro in 1 was obtained in a mixture of DMSO-d6 (80%)/D2O (20%) at pD 10 and characterized by
NMR, see below. The absorption spectrum of the NMR solution (see Table
S4 in Supporting Information) is identical
to the absorption band centered at 300 nm of Figure 2b at higher pH values. We were not able to
acquire the NMR spectra in the mixture MeOD/D2O 1:1 (v/v)
used throughout this work due to the low solubility of the compound
at the concentrations needed to run the NMR experiments.

Figure 2 Spectral variations
followed by stopped-flow after a direct pH
jump of a solution of compound 1 (2.25 × 10–5 M) in H2O/MeOH 1:1 (v/v) at pH = 1 to
the following pH values: (a) pH = 1.9; (b) pH = 5.7; and (c) pH =
9.7.

While the spectra of Figure 1a reflect the amine
protonation of the flavylium cation, eq 13, the spectra of Figure 1b are similar to
those found in some anthocyanins and related compounds, although in
this case this process occurs at higher pH values. It corresponds
to the equilibrium between flavylium cation and the species CB∧, that includes at least the quinoidal base, A, and
the spiro, SP, eqs 14 and 16. 13   14   15  where 16   17  

In conclusion, according
to Figure 1 the pseudo-equilibrium
is defined by pKa = 1.9 (protonation of
the amino group of the flavylium
cation) and pKa∧ = 7.5, the equilibrium between the
flavylium cation and the species that constitute CB∧, eq 14. There is experimental
evidence for the existence of A and spiro in CB∧. Conversely, no spectral evidence for the formation of ionized species
at the pseudo equilibrium, eqs 15 and 17 was achieved.

Additional
information from the absorption spectra monitored 10
ms after the addition of the base up to a few seconds was achieved
by carrying out a series of direct pH jumps from pH = 1.0 to representative
pH values, followed by the stopped-flow, Figure 2.

According to Figure 2a,b, in the pH range 1 < pH < 5.7 the
protonated flavylium
cation and the flavylium cation are formed initially in a ratio equal
to [AH+]/[AH22+] = Ka^∧/[H+]. The proton transfer is the fastest reaction of
the multistate and takes place during the mixing time of the stopped-flow.
For pH jumps both to 1.9 and to 5.7, the absorption spectra obtained
after 10 ms, after 10 s and after 1 min (not shown) are coincident.
This is in accordance to the presence of AH22+ and AH+ prior to the reverse pH jump. Differently, the
pH jump to pH = 9.7, Figure 2c, shows that the pseudo-equilibrium is reached after 0.3
s. The species that is formed, with λmax = 304 nm
has the same absorption maximum as the spiro compound identified by
NMR (Supporting Information, Table S4).
This means that most presumably the spiro is obtained from intramolecular
cyclization of the quinoidal base (i.e. formed immediately upon the
pH jump to 9.7). However, we cannot exclude the possible pathway through
the hemiketal. This result is similar to the behavior of anthocyanins,
that is, the quinoidal base does not hydrate in acidic medium, but
reacts with the hydroxide anion in basic medium to give the hemiketal,
that later tautomerizes (ring opening) leading to Cc.

In Figure 3a, a
direct pH jump to pH = 12.7 shows the initial formation of the quinoidal
base that disappears to give an absorption band, the shape and position
of which resemble those of a trans-chalcone (below
we prove that it is Ct–) together with an absorption
in the UV characteristic of the spiro form (λmax =
304 nm).

Figure 3 (a) Spectral variations after a direct pH jump of compound 1 (4.7 × 10–5 M) in H2O/MeOH
1:1 (v/v) at pH = 1 to pH = 12.7; (b) pH dependent absorption bands
for pH > 10 after 5 h. The data could be fitted for a pKa = 11.8.

At the equilibrium, Figure 3b, the monoionized trans-chalcone
is formed
at higher pH values and a third pKa =
11.8 is defined between the neutral species (A and spiro) and the
monoionized trans-chalcone (Ct–), see Supporting Information, Table S5.
Only at high pH values (pH > 10), the pseudo-equilibrium and the
equilibrium
become different. In Scheme 5 the mole fraction distribution of species at the pseudo-equilibrium
and equilibrium are shown. The color palette obtained from equilibrated
solution of compound 1 is also presented.

NMR Experiments
The study of compound 1 was complemented by running NMR spectra at different pH values (Figure 4). A sample for NMR
was prepared by dissolving the synthesized compound 1 in 450 μL of DMSO-d6 and 50 μL
of deuterated trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The 1H NMR spectra
were run at 298 K and any evolution of the system followed over time.
The 1H NMR spectrum only shows one set of peaks corresponding
to a single flavylium: two singlets assigned to protons 4 and 1′b
(Table S1, Supporting Information); two
ABX sets corresponding to three protons in relative positions 1, 2,
and 4 in the same aromatic ring, a set of aliphatic protons corresponding
to the propylene bridge and two aliphatic singlets corresponding to
amine methyl groups. The singlet at the lowest field was assigned
to H4 on the basis of the expected lowest electron density on this
position and in accordance with many published flavylium derivatives.18 Full characterization and assignment of 1H and 13C signals was achieved with heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation
(HMBC) and COSY spectra (Table S1, Supporting Information) allowing identification of the corresponding monoprotonated
flavylium trans isomer, most probably at the 4″
position (AH22+). The same NMR experiment was
performed modifying the solvent to the same one used in UV–vis
spectroscopic measurements (CD3OD/D2O/DCl 1:1:0.05).
The 1H NMR spectra were run at 298 K and showed again the
same set of peaks previously observed in DMSO-d6/TFA (9:1) (Figure S6, Supporting Information). According to the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY)
correlation between the methylene aliphatic protons and H6″,
the presence of the mono protonated flavylium trans isomer is confirmed (Figure 4, pink spectrum, AH22+, and Table S2, Supporting Information).

(pink spectrum at pD 1.0 in MeOD/D2O 1:1), AH+ species (blue spectrum at pD 6.0 in DMSO/D2O 8:2), spiro
species (black spectrum at pD 10.0 in DMSO/D2O 8:2) and
Ct– species (red spectrum at pD 14 in DMSO/NaOD)
(2 M).

The extremely low solubility of
the compound 1 in
MeOH/H2O 1:1 limited the use of NMR and mixtures of DMSO/D2O had to be used. Compound 1 was dissolved in
a mixture of DMSO-d6/D2O (8:2)
and the pD was adjusted to 6.0 with deuterated acetate buffer (0.025
M). The UV–vis spectra in this mixture of solvent is coincident
with the corresponding spectra at pH 5.2 in MeOH/H2O 1:1
(Table S3, Supporting Information). The 1H NMR spectra were run at 298 K and shows only one set of
peaks corresponding to a single species. Full characterization and
assignment of 1H and 13C signals was achieved
with HSQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY spectra (Table S3, Supporting Information), allowing us to identify the corresponding trans flavylium isomer (AH+) (blue spectrum, Figure 4).

To characterize
the species present under basic conditions, compound 1 was dissolved in a mixture of DMSO-d6/D2O (8:2) and te pD adjusted to 10.0 with a 0.1
M NaOD solution in D2O. The UV–vis spectrum in this
solvent mixture is coincident with the corresponding UV–vis
spectrum at pH 10.0 in MeOH/H2O 1:1, except for the absence
of the structured band in the visible (Table S4, Supporting Information). The low solubility of the compound
in DMSO-d6/D2O (8:2) limited
the use of NMR. It was nevertheless possible to acquire a 1H NMR spectrum that showed only 4 aromatic signals, a clear indication
that the structure is very symmetric (Table S4, Supporting Information) and could allow us to suggest a spiropyran-like
structure which most likely corresponds to the spiro (Sp) species
(Figure 4, black spectrum).

Compound 1 was further dissolved in a mixture of DMSO-d6/NaOD (2 M), and the respective 1H NMR showed only 4 aromatic signals, (red spectrum, Figure 4, Table S5, Supporting Information), an indication of an ionized trans-chalcone.b The respective UV–vis
spectrum is 30 nm red shifted with the corresponding UV–vis
spectrum at pH 12.7 in MeOH/H2O 1:1 (Table S5, Supporting Information). Most probably in both
solvents in basic medium we are dealing with the monoionized species;
a red shift of 20 nm was also observed for the flavylium cation at
pH = 1.0 from DMSO/H2O 1:1 to MeOH/H2O 1:1.

Reverse pH Jumps
Reverse pH jumps from solutions equilibrated
at different pH values during 1 day to pH = 1.0 are presented in Figure 5a. In the pH range
from 1 < pH < 5 the flavylium is the sole observed-species with
a more or less constant absorption spectrum. This result suggests
that after 1 day the solutions in this pH range (at the pseudo-equilibrium)
are flavylium cations (protonated and unprotonated at the amino substituent).
In the pH range 7 < pH < 10.5 the flavylium cation is still
the sole observed species but its absorption grows with a monoexponential
kinetics. In this initial pH range the flavylium cation is equilibrated
with quinoidal base and spiro forms. The quinoidal base existing prior
to the pH jump (in equilibrium with some AH+ for lower
pHs) corresponds to the initial flavylium cation, and the monoexponential
growth is due to the formation of more flavylium from the spiro. However,
we cannot exclude the existence of some minor fractions of cis-chalcone and hemiketal, in spite of the monoexponential
nature of the trace.

Figure 5 (a) Spectral variations monitored by stopped flow after
10 ms upon
reverse pH jumps from solutions of compound 1 (7.5 ×
10–5 M) equilibrated at different pH values [in
H2O/MeOH 1:1 (v/v)] to pH = 1.0; (b) initial spectrum obtained
after a reverse pH jump from equilibrated solutions of compound 1 (4.7 × 10–5 M) at pH = 12.6 (orange)
back to representative pHs. There is evidence for the second protonation
of the chalcone for [H+] > 1 M.c.

At pH = 11.7, the formation of
an absorption spectrum that could
be attributed to a monoprotonated trans-chalcone
on the basis of the observed λmax = 348 nm is clear.
The spectral evidence for the trans-chalcones is
given in Figure 5b.
The solution at pH = 12.6 was reverted back to a series of different
pH values. Only three different absorption spectra could be identified,
corresponding to Ct–, Ct and Ct+.

The diagram of Scheme 6 permits to rationalize not only the thermodynamic behavior
but also the kinetic steps. A direct pH jump to pH = 5.0 gives exclusively
the (non-protonated) flavylium cation. In the case of a pH jump to
10.0, the quinoidal base is immediately formed but in a few sub-seconds
equilibrates with the spiro. When a direct pH jump is performed to
pH = 12.0 the most stable species is now Ct–; the
kinetics is slow because the spiro should open in a cis form that has to isomerize. The isomerization can be slow by intrinsic
reasons or if the energy level of the cis species
is much higher than the respective trans. We were
not able to position the cis forms in the energy
level diagram because of their transient nature.

Spiro Opening
A series of reverse
pH jumps from equilibrated
solutions at pH = 10.1 back to lower pH values was performed and the
rate constants toward the new equilibrium represented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 (a) Spectral variations

solution of compound 1 (2 × 10–5 M) at pH = 10.1 to pH = 1.0 in H2O/MeOH 1:1 (v/v); (b)
absorption spectra 10 ms after a reverse pH jump from equilibrated
solutions at pH = 10.1 (2 × 10–5 M); and (c)
representation of the rate constant for the spiro opening process
as a function of pH.

At pH = 10 there is an equilibrium between the spiro and
the quinoidal
base. The reverse pH jumps to pH = 1.0, Figure 6a, show the formation of the two flavylium
cations with predominance of the amino protonated one. The spectrum
after 10 ms results from the conversion of the quinoidal base into
the flavylium cations. The kinetic process is monoexponential with
a rate constant kobs = 2.5 s–1, reflecting the kinetics of the spiro opening. The intermediate
from the spiro opening should be a cis form, while
the observed flavylium cations are in the trans geometry.
This confirms that the cis–trans isomerization in this compound seems to be very fast and consequently
we only observed experimentally the trans forms.

The absorption spectra taken 10 ms after the reverse pH jump, to
several lower pHs, Figure 6b, shows the quinoidal base or the flavylium cations according
to the final pH value. Besides the quinoidal base and the flavylium
cation absorptions in the visible, there are absorption bands in the
UV region of the spectrum characteristic of the spiro form. Interestingly,
the transient forms of the protonated spiro appear at lower pH values
and the absorption versus pH is compatible with two species with inflection
points at pH = 2.6 and pH = 4.2. We assign these pKa’s to the first and second protonations of the
spiro (at the amino groups). From this point onwards, the system evolves
to the equilibrium with a rate constant that changes with pH as represented
in Figure 6c. The shape
of Figure 6c can be
fitted with eq 18 18  where X represents the mole
fractions of the three spiro species, kn the respective rate constants and kOH the rate for the basic catalysis, similarly to the
one observed in hemiketals derived from flavylium cations.16 The fitting was achieved for the following parameters: k1 = 1 s–1; k2 = 75 s–1; k3 = 15 s–1; kOH = 1.0
× 107 M–1 s–1.

According to the kinetic data of the spiro opening reported in Figure 6c, four different
regimes could be identified as a function of pH; (i) highly acidic
(pH < 2.6) where the SP2+ species is the dominant one,
(ii) acidic (2.6 < pH < 4.2) where the SP+ species
prevails, (iii) neutral (4.2 < pH < 7.2) where the neutral SP
is the representative species and (iv) the basic one (pH > 7.2)
where
the rate increases with increasing pH.

The fitting through eq 18 indicates (i) the fully
protonated SP2+ species
exhibits the slower rate, (ii) the highest rate takes place for the
monoprotonated form, and (iii) the rate decreases again in the case
of the nonprotonated spiro. We suggest, Scheme 7, that the spiro opening is controlled by
the possibility of the nitrogen atoms to share their lone pair to
the conjugated π-system and also by the electrophilicity of
the ketalic carbon of spiro (C2). In that sense, it seems reasonable
to suggest that the more reactive spiro species will be the one able
to maximize both requirements. The monoprotonated spiro form (2.6
< pH < 4.2) has a nitrogen atom with a donating lone pair available,
and the ketalic carbon shows an important electrophilic character
because of the protonation of the other amino group. For that reason
we consider plausible that this species presents the higher rate constant
observed (k2 = 75 s–1). In the neutral spiro form (pH > 4.2) both nitrogen atoms present
their lone pair available, however the electrophilic character of
the ketalic carbon is lower and therefore the kinetic rate decreases
(k3 = 15 s–1). Finally,
the diprotonated spiro species (pH < 2.6) presents the higher electrophilic
character in its ketalic carbon; however, none of the lone pair of
nitrogen atoms are available to promote the intramolecular spiro opening.
In this case, we propose that the spiro opening is due to a nucleophilic
attack of a water molecule to its ketalic carbon. Therefore, the process
is intermolecular instead of intramolecular and it is controlled by
the diffusion of a water molecule. This change in the molecularity
of the reaction induces a drastic reduction on the constant rates
observed (k1 = 1 s–1).

Scheme 7 Proposed pH Dependent Mechanism for the Spiro Opening
Conclusions
The
results achieved through this work confirm that the multistate
of anthocyanins is not restricted to these compounds and could be
the general behavior of all flavylium derivatives. The scientific
approach and the knowledge developed for anthocyanins multistate of
species during more than one century of research is a powerful tool
that permitted rationalizing the complex 2,6-bis(arylidene)cyclohexanones
multistate of species.

In this particular case, the presence
of two amino substituents
in position 7 and 4′, lead to a push–pull effect from
both amino groups to the pyrylium core, allowing the stabilization
of the blue flavylium cation up to pH = 8, a feature not shown in
conventional synthetic flavylium compounds, where Ct becomes the most
stable species (typically from pH values over 4 or 5). Another important
aspect in 2,6-bis(arylidene)cyclohexanones is the presence of the
spiro form that is the equivalent of the hemiketal in anthocyanins,
which seems to be stabilized by the propylenic bridge.

Materials and Methods
All chemicals and solvents employed
for synthesis and preparation of samples were of analytical grade
and used without further purification if not otherwise specified.
The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ADVANCE III 400 spectrometer
(400 MHz for 1H, 100 MHz for 13C) at 298 K.
NMR assignments have been carried out on the basis of 1D NMR spectra
(1H, 13C, DEPT 135) and 2D NMR spectra (NOESY,
COSY, HSQC and HMBC). Elemental analysis was performed on an elemental
analysis system vario MICRO cube from Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH.

Synthesis of 6-(Dimethylamino)-4-(4-(dimethylamino)-2-hydroxybenylidene)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxanthylium
(1)
The compounds 4-dimethylamino-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
(0.39 g, 2.36 mmol) and cyclohexanone (0.116 g, 1.18 mmol) were dissolved
in 10 mL of ethanol and heated to 50 °C. The mixture was stirred
while dry hydrogen chloride gas was generated and bubbled in the mixture.
After 3 h of stirring, the color of the solution was changed from
yellow to purple. The reaction finished after 24 h. The precipitate
that formed was filtered off, recrystallized from methanol/diethyl
ether, and washed with diethyl ether. A dark violet powder was obtained
(60% yield).

Elemental analysis for C24H29Cl3N2O2·CH3OH (514.16
g/mol) Calcd: C, 58.2; H, 6.45; N, 5.43%. Found: C, 58.5; H, 6.53;
N, 5.62%.

Thermodynamic and Kinetic Studies
The pH jumps were
carried out by adding a stock solution of flavylium salt in 1:1 MeOH/HCl
0.2 M (1 mL) to a 3 mL quartz cuvette containing a solution of 1:1
MeOH/NaOH 0.2 M (1 mL), MeOH (0.5 mL), and universal buffer of Theorell
and Stenhagen (0.5 mL)19 at the desired
final pH. This defined the ionic strength as 0.1 M (controlled by
the NaCl concentration resulting from neutralization). The final pH
of the solutions was measured in a Crison basic 20 + pH meter. Spectroscopic
measurements were performed using Milli-Q water and methanol HPLC
grade, with a constant temperature of 20 ± 1 °C, with a
Varian-Cary 100 Bio or Varian-Cary 5000 spectrophotometers. The stopped-flow
experiments were conducted in an Applied Photophysics SX20 stopped-flow
spectrometer provided with a PDA.1/UV photodiode array detector. The
NMR and absorption spectrum at basic medium was carried out in a saturated
solution of compound 1 in (0.7 mL DMSO-d6 + 0.08 mL NaOD 40% + 0.1 mL D2O) circa 0.9 M in base.

a R = perfect gases
constant; T = temperature in kelvin; ΔG° = free Gibbs energy.

b The spectrum cannot distinguish between
Ct2– or Ct–, if the proton is
in fast exchange between the two hydroxyl groups.

c The stopped-flow cannot be used for
these extremely acidic solutions and the reaction to give the protonated
flavylium is very fast to get a good absorption spectrum.
