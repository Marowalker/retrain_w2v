In order to break the aging crude oil (WACO) emulsion
of the offshore
platform more effectively, a highly active isocyanate, polyaryl polymethylene
isocyanate (PAPI), was selected to modify the pilot-scale tannic acid
demulsifier. In the addition of PAPI, its molecular weight and viscosity
dramatically increased, while its relative solubility, hydroxyl number,
and cloud point exhibited an opposite direction, showing an increase
in hydrophobicity. After adding the above modified demulsifier, a
remarkably improved water removal of WACO emulsion accompanied by
a notable reduction of the water content in the oil phase monitored
by the Karl Fischer method was observed. Demulsification on the offshore
platform demonstrated that the best water removal was achieved when
the proportion of PAPI is 1.5 wt %. Its demulsification efficiency
reached 95.7%, which was 25.6% higher than the 76.2% of unmodified
demulsifier. In addition, a positive correlation between viscoelasticity
of emulsion and demulsification performance was found by only adjusting
the parameters of the rheometer. This method may be utilized to characterize
the demulsification performance by any rotary rheometer. The pilot-scale
demulsification experiment demonstrated that the water removal can
reach 98.14 vol % and residual water content was only 0.55 vol %.
These results further confirmed the excellent demulsification performance
of the modified demulsifier toward the WACO emulsion in production.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In order to improve the
crude oil recovery, polymer flooding has
been extensively applied. High concentration of oily sewage is produced
in demulsification, and the collected crude oil in the addition of
a water-cleaning agent and other additives is the main source of aging
crude oil emulsions. Containing various oilfield additives1 and chemical changes caused by oxidation,2−4 water-in-aging crude oil (WACO) emulsion is fairly stable;2,3,5 therefore, demulsification of
WACO emulsion is a great challenge, especially for the offshore platform.
Moreover, resulting from the actual need in the crude oil production,
the concentration of the additives is adjusted in a specified range.
This behavior inevitably has a negative effect on the demulsification
of WACO emulsion. Therefore, a fast and efficient demulsifier is needed.
A tannic acid polyether demulsifier has been proven to be efficient
in breaking the WACO emulsion of the offshore platform in our previous
work.1 According to the optimum formula,
a 700 kg scale-up production of the demulsifier is carried out. Demulsification
performance can be further improved by the reaction of the demulsifier
with tricarboxylic acid or isocyanate such as toluene diisocyanate
(TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), as reported in elsewhere.6,7 Modification increases molecular weight and consequently the demulsification
performance.7,8 In order to reduce reaction steps
and production costs, a modifier with high activity is necessary for
the pilot-scale product.

Having a high reaction activity, isocyanate
can react at low temperature
and shorten the reaction time. Moreover, the product in a concentration
of 50 wt % can be directly used as a demulsifier without any purification.
Polyaryl polymethylene isocyanate (PAPI) or polymethylene polyphenyl
polyisocyanate (pMDI) is a brown viscous liquid (150–250 mPa·s)
and is a main material for the synthesis of polyurethane foam.9,10 Containing a high average functionality (∼2.7),11 PAPI is also taken as a cross-linking agent
to modify starch.12 Compared with TDI,
PAPI has less toxicity and easier to store without interaction with
each other. As a liquid, PAPI is easily miscible with organic solvents
such as xylene at room temperature without the disadvantage of solid
MDI, which crystallizes easily at low temperature. More importantly,
PAPI has multiple benzene rings. These benzene rings can increase
the π–π interaction between demulsifier molecules
and interfacial active substances, reducing the stability of the interfacial
film and finally improving the demulsification performance.13 In order to make full use of the above advantages,
PAPI is an ideal material to modify our demulsifier.

In this
article, the influence of PAPI on demulsification performance
and properties including hydroxyl number, relative solubility number
(RSN), molecular weight, and viscosity is studied. Whether this modified
demulsifier can be applied to actual oilfield production is evaluated
by simulated equipment. In addition, viscoelastic measurement of model
crude oil in demulsification is performed by a specified Physica MCR301
rheometer (Anton Paar, Austria) or AR-G2 stress-controlled rheometer
(TA, USA).14−21 Meanwhile, whether other rheometers without above fixtures like
a HAAKE MARS III rheometer can be applied to demulsification research
through simple parameter adjustments has been tried in this article.

Compared with other demulsifiers, this demulsifier has the following
advantages: (1) Though the price of tannic acid is higher, its dosage
is less than 0.5%, which has little effect on the price of the demulsifier,
and therefore, the effect of the total cost is weak. (2) Because of
the small addition and low water content in the oil, remarkable economic
benefits can be obtained, such as transportation cost of the submarine
pipeline, pipeline anticorrosion cost, and post-treatment cost of
crude oil. (3) As a polyether with similar chemical composition to
other demulsifiers, it does not affect the existing process. In addition,
containing degradable tannic acid components, it has no impact on
the environment.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure Characterization
Various
molecular weights are given in Table 1. All molecular weights increase with the increase
in the content of PAPI. This behavior suggests that the addition of
PAPI promotes intermolecular linkages. For DP25, its molecular weight
cannot be obtained due to the difficulty to pass through the 0.22
μm membrane. This phenomenon suggests a strong cross-linking
network at this dosage. The highest Mη also
illustrates this phenomenon.

DP10	1.0	6984	16244	2.33	7055	
DP15	1.5	7064	16386	2.33	10501	
DP20	2.0	7690	17536	2.28	12917	
DP25	2.5	 	 	 	15103	
2.2 RSN Value, Hydroxyl Number, and Viscosity
RSN as well as hydrophile–lipophile balance (HLB) is a parameter
to characterize the hydrophilic and lipophilic properties of a surfactant.
Different from the HLB value calculated by hydrophilic groups of PPO-PEO
polyether, the RSN value can only be measured by toluene and dimethoxyethane. Figure 1a shows a negative
relation between the RSN value and the content of PAPI. In the addition
of PAPI, hydrophilic hydroxyl groups are replaced by hydrophobic benzene
rings, leading to a striking decrease in hydroxyl number as shown
in Figure 1b. As expected,
with the continuous addition of PAPI, the hydrophilicity of demulsifier
molecules decreases, resulting in the reduction of the RSN value.
Even a small amount of PAPI is added, the RSN value has an obvious
reduction. Moreover, the remarkable increase in viscosity further
confirms the modification reaction, as shown in Figure 1b.

(b) of demulsifiers
as a function of PAPI.

2.3 Linear Viscoelastic Regime
Figure 2a presents the elastic
modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G″) dependence on stress. For all samples, G″ remarkably dominates G′,
implying that all demulsifiers display a behavior of viscous liquids.
The phenomena that four samples except DP25 have similar G′ as exhibited in Figure 2b indicate that they do not form strong networks. In
contrast, the strongest G′ of DP25 accounts
for the formation of the cross-linking network. Both the highest viscosity
and Mη further support this phenomenon. The
larger network structure of DP25 exhibits solid-like behavior, which
makes it having a short linear viscoelastic regime. A good linear
viscoelastic regime is observed for all samples between 0.7 and 60
Pa.

of stress (a) and elastic modulus dependence on the content of PAPI
(b) at fixed stress.

2.4 Effect of Modification on Cloud Point
The hydrogen bond formed by the ether bond and the adsorbed water
is broken at elevated temperature, resulting in the worse solubility
of polypropylene oxide (PPO)-polyethylene oxide (PEO) polyether. When
the temperature is elevated enough to cause a change of the solution
from clear to turbid, the intersection is taken as the cloud point.22,23Figure 3a demonstrates
the temperature dependence of turbidity. For DP, a linear-ship appears
between its turbidity and temperature in the experimental range, and
thus, no cloud point is found.

solutions at 5 g·L–1 (a), the relationship
between RSN and cloud point
(b), and turbidity curves at various concentrations of DP15 (c). The
insets are the cloud points at different contents of PAPI (b) and
concentrations of DP15 (c).

The cloud point decreases with the increase in
the content of PAPI
as shown in Figure 3a. The addition of PAPI reduces the hydroxyl number and thus the
cloud point. Consequently, the cloud point also reflects the hydrophobicity
and hydrophilicity of polyether, as shown in Figure 3b. A high RSN value means strong hydrophilicity
of polyether and thus a high cloud point. As a result, a positive
relationship between cloud point and RSN value is observed. Figure 3c displays the turbidity
curves of DP15 at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 g·L–1. Consistent with other references and our observation,1,24 concentration has a negative impact on the cloud point. The cloud
point results from the phase separation caused by the aggregation
of micelles.25 Obviously, increased concentration
of polyether is prone to forming a large size micelle,22 making phase separation easier and thus reducing
the cloud point.

2.5 Effect of Modification on Demulsification
in Laboratory Test
Demulsification of WACO emulsion and their
photographs are presented in Figure 4. The water removal increases rapidly with demulsification
time and slows down after 90 min. The water removal of the modified
demulsifier is clearly higher than that of the unmodified DP, which
may be the contribution of increased Mw.7,8 The enriched branches may be another factor contributing to demulsification
improvement.7,23 In addition, benzene rings both
in modifiers and demulsifier also contribute to the demulsification.
Enhanced aromaticity of the modified demulsifier molecule is beneficial
to its π–π interaction with asphaltene.13,26 These aspects help demulsifier molecules to reduce the stability
of the interfacial film and finally enhance the demulsification performance.

Figure 4 Water
separation of WACO emulsion at 70 °C and 100 mg·L–1 (a) and at different contents of PAPI (b), and photographs
of DP25 at different times (c) and different demulsifiers at 150 min
(d).

As illustrated in Figure 4b, the water removal is in the order of DP15
≈ DP20
≈ DP25 > DP10 > DP. This order reveals that high dosage
of
the modifier is beneficial to demulsification. However, the high viscosity
restricts its fluidity and prevents its application at high dosage
of the modifier like DP25. Furthermore, an amount of crude oil attaches
on the glass tube due to the interaction between its polar groups
and hydroxyl groups existing on the glass surface. This phenomenon
is also found in our experiments and other references.1,27−29

The water content in demulsification is monitored
by the Karl Fischer
method at an interval of 10 min. Figure 5a exhibits the opposite variation of these
two curves. With a remarkable increase in water removal of DP25, the
water content in crude oil also maintains a rapid downward trend.
After 90 min, the water removal increases slowly accompanied by a
slow decline of water content. As expected, a good relationship between
water removal and water content is maintained in the whole demulsification
as demonstrated in Figure 5a. Though the water removal of DP25 is higher than that of
DP, the gap of water content is continuously shortened with the demulsification
time until a similar result appears, which is 6.38 and 6.52 wt %,
respectively, as depicted in Figure 5b.

Figure 5 Water removal and water content of DP25 (a) and water
contents
of DP and DP25 (b).

2.6 Demulsification Measurement on Offshore Platform
Resulting from long storage, the crude oil is prone to occurring
chemical reactions,2,3,5,30,31 which have
an opposite effect on demulsification. Therefore, it is necessary
to re-evaluate the platform. Based on the results of the laboratory
test and consideration of field applications, DP15 and DP20 are selected.
These results are shown in Figure 6. The water removal of the BH demulsifier is only 27.3%
at 60 min, while that of DP is 76.2%. The demulsification efficiency
reaches 95.7% for DP15 and 89.8% for DP20. Moreover, significant differences
of separated water among the four demulsifiers are found in Figure 6b. Due to the poor
performance of the BH demulsifier, WACO emulsion on the offshore platform
cannot be treated. The modified demulsifier can break the WACO emulsions
more effectively than the unmodified one. Among all demulsifiers,
the demulsification performance is the best at a dosage of 1.5 wt
% PAPI. It is noted that the results of platform demulsification are
better than those of laboratory evaluation. The possible explanation
is that the aging of WACO emulsion in the laboratory leads to the
formation of a more stable emulsion and hard demulsification.

of WACO emulsions being produced on the offshore
platform at 70 °C and 100 mg·L–1 (a) and
their photographs at 60 min (b). BH is a current demulsifier on the
offshore platform to break crude oil emulsions.

2.7 Effect of Modification on Interfacial Activity
As shown in Figure 7, the interfacial tensions (IFT) of all demulsifiers decrease at
elevated concentration. The hydrophobic chains tend to attach with
the crude oil, while the hydrophilic groups are adsorbed at the oil–water
interface, which helps in IFT reduction. Therefore, the higher the
concentration of demulsifier, the more demulsifier molecules absorbed
on the interface, and the lower the IFT. Compared with DP at fixed
concentration, DP20 and DP25 increase IFT, while DP10 and DP15 have
an opposite effect toward IFT. The former is attributed to the increased
hydrophobicity and formation of the cross-linking network,32 while the latter may result from the improved
branches at low PAPI dosage.33,34 Though the concentration
of crude oil in kerosene is only 30%, the crude oil without the demulsifier
is prone to adhering on the glass tube of the interfacial tensiometer
with its strong adhesion, leading to a failed IFT measurement. Figure 7b displays the correlation
among RSN, interfacial tension, and water removal obtained from Figure 6 at 60 min and 100
mg·L–1. With the decrease in RSN, the interfacial
tension first decreases to the minimum and then increases. Meanwhile,
the water removal demonstrates an opposite change. The surprising
aspect of these data is that the minimum interfacial tension and the
maximum water removal appear simultaneously at an RSN value of 10.95,
indicating that both high interfacial activity and suitable RSN value
are beneficial to the improvement of demulsification performance.7,35

tension as a function of concentration (a) and correlation
among RSN, interfacial tension, and water removal at 60 min and 100
mg·L–1 from Figure 6 (b).

2.8 Rheological Behavior of WACO Emulsions
All oscillatory shear results in demulsification are demonstrated
in Figure 8. Different
from the result of G′ > G″ obtained from simulated crude oil in the literature,36,37 in the whole measurement, a more viscous liquid rather than an elastic
one is found since G″ > G′.38 It is well accepted that G′ and G″ are related to
the properties and stability of emulsions.39 High values of G′ and G″ mean a stable emulsion.40 Moreover, G′ is taken as a good indicator of the interaction
and cross-linking of interfacial molecules.19,21,36,41

Figure 8 G′ (a) and G″ (b)
of WACO emulsions as a function of time at 70 °C and 100 mg·L–1. The inset is the viscoelasticity of the blank.

The initial rapid reduction of G′ of all
samples can be attributed to environmental changes caused by the addition
of the rotator, such as temperature changes from room temperature
to selected temperature and torque required by the equipment to reach
the selected shear rate.39 For the blank, G′ continuously increased from 500 s, probably caused
by the combination of initial rearrangement and consolidation of the
asphaltenes aggregated at the interface.36,39 It is reported that the asphaltene had an important contribution
to G′;20 therefore,
the newly formed network between rearranged asphaltenes leads to a
more viscoelastic film under the oscillation of the rotator.

On the addition of the demulsifier, G′
declines in the form of a straight line. This behavior suggests that
the demulsifier presents interfacial activity soon after the addition.
The demulsifier molecules are absorbed onto the oil–water interface
and compete with the natural surfactant and added additives, resulting
in the formation of a less elastic interface with a lower value of G′.39 As more molecules
diffuse to the interface, the viscoelasticity continues to decline
accompanied by a rapid reduction of the stability of the interfacial
film. This behavior promotes the coalescence of water droplets leading
to the change of the emulsion’s properties. This phenomenon
can be observed by a decrease in viscosity at the macroscale as observed
by Kolotova et al.38 and a reduction of G′ at the microscale as exhibited in Figure 8a and other references.14,15,21

Since there exists a linear-ship
between G′
and demulsification time, the slope of this line represents the demulsification
speed, while the plateau modulus reflects the demulsification ability.
The negative slopes of DP and DP15 are 5.38 × 10–5 and 8.57 × 10–5, respectively, simulated
by Origin software, while the plateau moduli are around 1.5 and 1.3
Pa. These data provide a higher demulsification speed and demulsification
ability of DP15 than those of DP. Consequently, this phenomenon further
confirms the conclusion that the demulsification performance of the
modified demulsifier has been significantly improved.

Resulting
from the greatly decreased number and size of water droplets
in demulsification as observed in our previous work,1 the coalescence is hard to occur, and the water removal
becomes slow until the appearance of a plateau. Therefore, the intersection
between the declined line and the plateau can be regarded as the end
of demulsification. The G′ of DP enters the
plateau from 6000 s, and G″ is 5500 s. The
results of the offshore platform also demonstrate that DP does not
enter the stable stage of water removal in the test range (3600 s)
as shown in Figure 9, consistent with the rheological results of DP. The times that G′ and G″ of DP15 enter the
plateau are 4000 and 3000 s, respectively, in good agreement with
the result that the water removal of DP15 changes little in water
removal after 50 min as revealed by Figure 6.

Figure 9 Schematic demulsification process of WACO emulsions:
(a) the separation
of collided water droplets and the water separation of WACO emulsions
in the addition of the demulsifier (b) and modified demulsifier (c).

In addition, the order of G′
is blank >
DP > DP15, and G″ also shows the same order.
Therefore, this order builds relationships among three samples in
viscoelasticity. The decline of viscoelasticity of emulsion means
a dramatic change existing at the oil–water interface. Obviously,
this change is caused by the breakup of the interfacial film after
the demulsifier is added. Furthermore, the degree of this change is
closely related to the demulsification performance of the demulsifier.
As a result, a conclusion can be drawn that the lower the viscoelasticity
reduced by the demulsifier, the more severe the damage of the oil–water
interface, and the more striking the demulsification effect toward
WACO emulsions. This conclusion is also consistent with the Kang group
on the effect of the demulsifier on the rheology of crude oil.14

The above discussion demonstrates that
the rheometer equipped with
a coaxial cylinder and a rotator can be employed to measure viscoelasticity
of crude oil emulsion in demulsification by adjusting parameters.
Moreover, this method can even be expanded to characterize the instability
of emulsions.

2.9 Effect of Different Methods on Demulsification
Performance in Simulated Application
Based on the excellent
demulsification performance of DP15, an amount of 50 kg in a concentration
of 50 wt % xylene solution is produced to treat the WACO emulsions
in the production of the oilfield. These demulsification results at
different methods are listed in Table 2. At all methods, the water removal is over 94% or
even 98% in the presence of DP15, and therefore, their water content
is less than 1.5%. The water content reaches 0.55% at the addition
of DP15, much lower than that of 1.54% reached by electric stripping.
Moreover, a considerable decrease in water content is observed when
these two methods are used simultaneously, showing the existence of
a synergistic effect. These data demonstrate that the water content
can be reduced from 30% to less than 1% in 40 min in the presence
of DP15. This low water content has great significance in reducing
the transportation cost of offshore platforms. Obviously, a conclusion
can be made that DP15 is an effective demulsifier in breaking the
WACO emulsions in production.

Methods

2.10 Effect of Dehydration Time on Demulsification
Performance in Simulated Application
Table 3 lists the demulsification data at different
times. Resulting from the dynamic production, a small fluctuation
in water removal and water content is observed. These data reflect
that there is no significant change in water removal over time, indicating
that the demulsification performance can reach the optimal value within
40 min.

Times

2.11 Demulsification Mechanism of Modified Demulsifier
In summary, combining the above discussion and previous research,
the schematic demulsification process of WACO emulsion is shown in Figure 9. Elastic deformation
occurs on the contact surface when a protected water droplet collides
with another. Having strong elasticity, these two water droplets are
easily separated from each other without any changes observed by Feng
et al.,42 as exhibited in Figure 9a. Once the DP demulsifier
is added, a remarkable decrease in elasticity leads to a deterioration
of deformation recovery at the interface. With the size reduction
of asphaltene aggregation in the presence of the demulsifier observed
by Atta et al.,43 the interfacial film
is easy to be raptured. In addition, there are also existing hydrogen
bonds and weak π–π interaction13,26 between the aromatic rings and hydrophilic polyether groups in demulsifier
molecules and the asphaltenes, which contains a polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon core as revealed by Schuler et al.44 Therefore, the asphaltenes are easily replaced by demulsifier
molecules followed by the destroying of the interfacial film. Coalescence
occurs once the droplets are exposed to each other, as demonstrated
in Figure 9b. As a
result, the number of water droplets decreases significantly by the
comparison of the microscopic photographs in Figure 9a,b. The number and size of water droplets
varying with demulsification time observed by the microscope in the
presence of the demulsifier are shown in our previous work.1 Unlike the microscopic photographs of Figure 9b that remain a great
number of small water droplets, only a few large droplets are observed
in Figure 9c, reflecting
a better aggregation of water droplets of the demulsifier modified
with PAPI. Meanwhile, in the presence of the modified demulsifier,
the elasticity becomes worse than any other sample. Due to larger
molecular weight, higher branching, and stronger hydrogen bonds and
π–π interaction with asphaltene, the modified demulsifier
can replace more asphaltenes, leading to the damage of the interfacial
film faster and more efficiently. Finally, the water droplets coalesce
at the fastest speed to achieve the highest dehydration performance
as presented in Figure 9c.

3 Conclusions
Having many advantages,
including low toxicity, easy preservation,
solubility, high activity, and multiple benzene rings, PAPI is an
ideal modifier to replace TDI and MDI for demulsifier modification.
With the addition of the PAPI, the hydrophobicity of the demulsifier
is enhanced, showing a decrease in hydroxyl value, RSN value, and
cloud point accompanied by an increase in viscosity and molecular
weight. Laboratory demulsification shows that the demulsification
performance has been dramatically improved by modification, and water
removal can be increased by 15.6% in 120 min. Monitoring of water
content in demulsification demonstrates a corresponding relationship
between water removal and water content of top crude oil. Meanwhile,
whether the demulsification performance is strong or not, the water
content has little difference finally (only 0.14%), rather than as
big as water removal (13.9% at 150 min). Having high interfacial activity
especially for DP15, the demulsifier improves the water removal. Consequently,
the water removal reaches 95.7% in 60 min on offshore platform demulsification.
The result confirms that the DP15 is more suitable for the offshore
platform toward WACO emulsion. Therefore, this proportion can be applied
to modify the scale-up product and apply it to the pilot production
of crude oil on the offshore platform. Demulsification performance
is also positively correlated with the reduction in viscoelasticity
of crude oil. The larger the slope of elastic modulus decreases, the
faster the demulsification speed is. Furthermore, the fewer the plateau
modulus, the stronger the demulsification ability. Therefore, the
rheometer equipped with a coaxial cylinder and a rotator provides
a powerful tool to characterize the demulsification performance by
the measurement of viscoelasticity. The pilot-scale demulsification
test of WACO emulsions produced in the oilfield shows that the modified
demulsifier can reduce the water content from 30% to less than 1%,
indicating that the demulsifier can effectively treat the WACO emulsions.

It should be noted that the dynamic distribution of the demulsifier
and modified demulsifier with temperature, water content, and time
between oil phase and aqueous phase remains to be studied.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
PAPI (PM200) was purchased
from Wanhua Chemical Group (China). Xylene, methanol, and ethanol
were purchased from Sino Pharm Chemical Reagent Corporation (China).
The DP demulsifier was a scale-up product of 700 kg based on industrial-grade
tannic acid according to our previous work.1 Corresponding to PAPI dosages of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 wt %, DP10–DP25
were obtained by the reaction of PAPI and DP at 60 °C in xylene
(Scheme 1).

Reaction of DP Demulsifier with PAPI
4.2 Characterization
Gel permeation chromatography
(Shimadzu, Japan) was employed to determine the average molecular
weight (Mw) by using polystyrene and chromatographically
pure tetrahydrofuran. Viscosity average molecular weight (Mη) was measured at 25 °C in methanol as described
in the reference.15 For poly(propylene
oxide), the corresponding Mark–Houwink parameters of K and α were 76.9 × 10–3 and
0.55, respectively.45

The hydroxyl
number was determined based on the esterification of hydroxyl groups
and phthalic anhydride solution in pyridine. The RSN value was measured
according to the description of Wu et al.46 The turbidity of aqueous demulsifier solution was measured by an
HACH TL2300 turbidimeter as described in our previous work.1

A spinning drop interfacial tensiometer
TX-500C (CNG Company, USA)
was employed to perform the interfacial tension measurement at 8000
rpm and 70 °C between WACO (30 wt % kerosene solution) and aqueous
demulsifier solution.

4.3 Demulsification Bottle Test
The WACO
emulsion in a graduated cone-shaped tube with a demulsifier at 70
°C was shaken violently 200 times followed by a recording of
demulsification efficiency.23 To observe
the water droplets in the oil phase, the oil phase before and after
demulsification was examined by a microscope (Chongqing Optec Instrument
Co., Ltd., China).

4.4 Determination of Water Content of Oil Phase
Water content of crude oil in demulsification was measured by an
HYG-809B micromoisture analyzer (Wuhan Huaneng Sunlight Electric Co.,
China) based on the Karl Fischer method. The solvent was a mixture
of xylene and ethanol in a mass ratio of 3:0.8. Equipped with a double
platinum electrode, this instrument provided the water quality of
the sample. The water content was calculated according to ASTM D1744
(ASTM D1744 standard test method for determination of water in liquid
petroleum products by the Karl Fischer reagent). In detail, crude
oil (0.15 g) was obtained at 1 cm below the surface with a 1.5 mL
centrifuge tube followed by the addition of the above solvent (0.5
g). The crude oil was shaken vigorously until it was completely dissolved.
Crude oil solution (0.02 g) was taken out with a 50 μL syringe
and injected into the electrolytic cell. The measured water quality
of the injected sample (WQm) was recorded. The water content
(WC) of crude oil can be calculated as follows: 1   2   3  where WQcs is the
water quality of crude oil and solvent in the centrifuge tube (μg),
WQs is the water quality of the solvent (μg), Qc and Qs correspond to the quality of crude oil
and solvent, respectively (μg), Qe is the quality
of crude oil solution extracted by a syringe (μg), and WCs is water content of the solvent (wt %).

4.5 Viscosity and Rheology Measurements
An HAAKE MARS III rheometer (Thermo Scientific, Germany) with a coaxial
cylinder sensor system (CC26 Ti, diameter = 26 mm, gap = 1.90 mm)
was employed to perform viscosity measurement of demulsifier xylene
solution (50 wt %) at 25 °C and shear rate of 7.34 s–1. To ascertain the linear viscoelastic regime, a stress sweep test
of bulk rheology at a fixed frequency of 1 Hz was carried out in the
range of 0.1–1000 Pa at 25 °C. The experiment was conducted
with parallel plate geometries (C60/1° TiL, diameter = 60 mm,
cone angle = 1°, gap = 0.052 mm).

The viscoelasticity measurement
was also performed on this rheometer at 70 °C by the oscillation
time method at a frequency of 1 Hz and a stress of 1 Pa in the linear
viscoelastic regime. A preheated WACO emulsion (40 mL) was taken with
a plastic tube followed by the addition of the demulsifier. The plastic
tube was shaken vigorously, and this emulsion (22 g) was poured into
the cylinder. The rotator was immersed into the WACO emulsion, and
its top was just below the surface. To prevent the contact between
the rotator (CC20Ti, diameter = 20 mm) and the separated aqueous phase
in demulsification, the gap between the bottom of the cylinder and
the bottom of the rotator was adjusted to 21 mm as shown in Scheme 2, and therefore,
it could provide the changes of the crude oil phase without the disturbance
of the bottom aqueous phase. The concentration of the demulsifier
was 100 mg/L, and the demulsification time was 7200 s. A plastic cap
was placed over the cylinder to avoid water evaporation. For comparison,
a blank emulsion without the demulsifier was employed.

4.6 Simulated Application of the Oilfield
To validate the demulsification performance toward WACO emulsions
in production, a pilot test was carried out in the terrestrial terminal
treatment plant. These WACO emulsions were collected in the treatment
of crude oil. Since WACO emulsions were dynamically produced, their
water content was not stable. Its average water content was around
30 vol % by repeating seven times at different times. The experimental
equipment with an electric stripping function was provided by Offshore
Petroleum Development Engineering Technology Co., Ltd. In this equipment,
the WACO emulsion flow was 3 m3·h–1, and the retention time was 40 min. To measure the demulsification
performance at different dehydration times, the valve was closed until
the specified time. The concentration of the demulsifier was 200 mg·L–1, and the temperature in this equipment was 65 °C.
