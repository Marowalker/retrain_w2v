HOMA (Harmonic Oscillator Model of
Aromaticity) is a simple, successful,
and widely used geometrical aromaticity index. However, HOMA can also
be used as a general molecular descriptor appropriate for any type
of molecule. It reaches the global maximum for benzene, whereas the
potent magnetic aromaticity NICS index has no lower or upper limits.
Hence, questions arise and go beyond mere differences between the
geometric and magnetic aspects of aromaticity: (1) Does a molecule
of aromaticity greater than that of benzene, but undisclosed by the
HOMA definition, exist? (2) Can the Kekuléne cyclohexatriene
moiety with HOMA = 0 exist as a part of a larger system? (3) Can the
geometrical aromaticity index be defined better? Our answer to the
first query is “It is not likely enough”, to the second,
“Why not define HOMA using a less mysterious molecule than
cyclohexatriene?”, and to the third, “It is possible
to construct another fair geometrical index, but is it better for
evaluating aromaticity?” To find these answers, we have studied:
(1) the HOMA and NICS indices of over 50 hexahomosubstituted benzenes,
(2) the HOMA, as well as EN and GEO, indices of over 100 triply fused
hexasubstituted benzenes, and (3) the HOMA and new Geometrical Auxiliary
Index (GAI) , of different unsaturated and saturated, aromatic and
aliphatic hydrocarbons including all alkane constitutional isomers
composed of up to nine carbon atoms.

Introduction
Modern quantum-mechanics-based
computational chemistry is focused
on obtaining exact data. However, for the vast majority of molecules,
obtaining exact data is still unachievable. Moreover, for most computational
chemists, only approximate theoretical levels are accessible. On the
other hand, there are plenty of organic physical chemistry (semi)empirical
descriptors, such as substituent-, solvent-, reactivity-, aromaticity-,
topological indices, etc., that may be helpful for directing the research
and modeling of the properties of interest. Even though it seems that
interest in those descriptors already reached its highest intensity
in the 1950s–1980s, such indices are helpful in categorizing
and preselecting species for further scrupulous quantum-chemical analyses.
Despite the fact that they do not always have a clear physical meaning,
their use is easier, quicker, cost-effective, and more available to
a broader chemical community than the robust computational methods.
Such simple parameters can be auxiliary in materials design, and thus
they deserve to be discussed, understood, and developed.

HOMA
(Harmonic Oscillator Model of Aromaticity) is one of the simplest,
most successful and most widely used aromaticity indices.1,2 It embraces the geometrical aspect of aromaticity in a formula in
which benzene bond length is the internal standard of perfect aromaticity.
The more different from benzene and the more unequal and alternating
the bonds are, the lower the HOMA index of the analyzed ring is, denoting
how less geometrically aromatic it is. The HOMA index can be expressed
as follows 1  where Ri and Ropt stand for the ith bond
length in the analyzed ring and the reference benzene ring (1.388
Å), respectively, n is the number of the CC
bonds in the ring, and α = 257.7 Å–2 is
a normalization factor making the unitless HOMA index equal to 1 for
perfectly aromatic benzene and 0 for a perfectly alternating hypothetical
Kekulé cyclohexatriene ring.

The HOMA index is parameterized
for the most important heteroatoms
and can be reparameterized further.3,4 It can be decomposed
into purely geometrical and purely energetical components.5,6 Moreover, it has recently been shown that HOMA can be used also
as a general molecular index adequate for unsaturated or saturated,
cyclic or acyclic, linear or branched (hydrocarbon) molecules.7,8 We proposed calling this generalized property the savoricity. Quite recently we have additionally shown that it can be a topological
index in the structural formula version of the graph theory.9 The HOMA index has also been a source of several
interesting modifications.10,11 The multidimensionality
of aromaticity and the incompatibility of different aromaticity measures
have been deliberated for a long time.12−16 However, recently, it seems that direct assessment
of aromaticity is approached. For example, the impact of the π-electron
cyclic delocalization on aromatics stabilization energy was quantitatively
accounted for by determining the atom–atom charge transfer,
repulsion energy, and spin orbitals population at π-electron
sites.15

The unconformity between
the indices can be to some extent associated
with their different construction. Indeed, HOMA is a relative index
reaching its maximum for benzene, whereas the definition of the other
most extensively used NICS (Nucleus-Independent Chemical Shift) magnetic
aromaticity index17−21 sets out no lower or upper limits of this index. As a consequence,
juxtaposition of the HOMA and NICS values raises questions not only
about the differences between the geometric and magnetic aspects of
aromaticity. There are numerous molecules with NICS(0) or NICS(1)
indicating aromaticity larger than that of benzene, so: (1) Does a
molecule of aromaticity greater than that of benzene exist, but is
undisclosed by the HOMA definition? A hypothetical cyclohexatriene
molecule has by definition HOMA = 0. However, (2) Can the Kekuléne
cyclohexatriene moiety with HOMA = 0 exist as a part of a larger system?
The third question that appears is about the construction of the geometrical
aromaticity index: (3) Can the geometrical aromaticity index be defined
better? This paper attempts to discuss these three questions. These
questions do not exhaust the issues that might be raised. One of them,
raised by one of the reviewers of this paper, is Does the HOMA index
can be reformulated to well distinguish nonaromatic from antiaromatic
structures? However, the answer to this problem is difficult and it
is worth to be a central issue of the future study.

Calculations
All calculations were performed using the B3LYP functional,22,23 the 6-31G** Pople type basis set,24 and
Gaussian09 software.25 The 6-31G** basis
set was shown to perform fairly well in geometry, frequency, energy,
and electron density calculations.26,27 Each minimum
was confirmed by checking that all harmonic frequencies were positive
and that the optimized molecules exhibited proper symmetry. The alkane
conformers were found using the molecular mechanics search of conformer
distribution as implemented in Spartan’14 suite of programs.28 The conformers were reoptimized at the B3LYP/6-31G**
level, and all were local minima on PES.

Results and Discussion
Does an
“Overaromatic” Carbon Ring Exist?
It is clear
that search for a molecule with the aromaticity exceeding
that of benzene cannot be based on the HOMA index alone: it reaches
the global maximum for benzene by definition (eq 1). Hence here, the NICS(1) or NICS(0) indices
serve us as preselection parameters: if they indicate that the magnetic
aromaticity is greater than for benzene, then the system is analyzed
further. The NICS(1) index is a reverse chemical shift value calculated
1 Å above the center of the ring, while NICS(0) is analogous
value taken in the ring center.17−19 We assume that “overaromatic”
organic molecules can be found primarily among the planar six-membered
rings with equal C–C bonds. Although this condition seems to
be necessary, it is not sufficient. In fact, all C–C bonds
in the central coronene ring are equal, but this ring exhibits a decreased
aromaticity (HOMA ≈ 0.75) and the rings in (nonplanar) [6]radialene
and (planar) cyclohexanehexone (CHONE) are nonaromatic and strongly
nonaromatic (HOMA ≈ −1.3 and −5.4, respectively).29

Collation of the NICS(1), NICS(0), and
HOMA aromaticity indices and the CC bond distances for about 50 hexahomosubstituted
benzenes (Table 1)
contains both existing and hypothetical molecules. A large set of
such compounds was not analyzed earlier in terms of their aromaticity.
Moreover, although we calculated several other hexahomosubstituted
benzenes, we skipped them because we received no significant new information.
The hypothetical structures, like the hexalithium-, hexaphosphaethyno-,
hexaisocyano-, hexasiloxane-, or hexachlorosylbenzene, are used here
to provide smooth changes of the substituent properties. Nevertheless,
some of them are probably now synthesizable. Several molecules, e.g.,
F, O–, CN, or C≡CH hexasubstituted benzenes,
exhibit perfect D6h symmetry.
But, most of them have a reduced symmetry because of substituent bulkiness,
steric repulsion, and interactions which can even lead to losing ring
planarity. Nevertheless, all studied compounds exhibit only one ring
CC bond length, and even if they have decreased symmetry, they experience
no NICS(1) index splitting.21

Among the molecules collected in Table 1, there are some exceptional
cases (Scheme 1). The C6 molecule converges to
the D3h allenic cycle, which is also predicted
at much higher
levels of theory.30 The OK- and ONa-substituted
molecules form nonplanar crowns of the D3d symmetry. The hypothetical Li and BeH, as well as
OLi-, SLi-, OBe-, and SBe-substituted molecules, are starlike D6h structures with metal atoms
placed at the CC bond intersection straight lines. Most molecules
with bulky substituents, like ONO2, OPh, OSiH3, and SMe, have the most stable forms with the groups alternatingly
directed up and down the ring and thus exhibit the S6 symmetry. The other molecules also adopt similar conformations
and have obvious features like hydrogen bonding (COOH, OH, CHO, etc.).

Virtual BeH and Li hexasubstituted D6h benzenes. At the B3LYP/6-31G**
level, the (*) types exhibit a few imaginary modes while the (☆)
types show all real frequencies.

Finally,
it must be stressed that quite a large group of molecules
gathered in Table 1 have been known for a long time. Mellitic acid (hexacarboxybenzene)
and mellitates have been known since the first half of the 19th century.31,32 The hexa iodo-, bromo-, chloro-, hexamethyl-, and hexahydroxy-benzenes
(and hexahydroxylates) have also been known since the 19th century.33−40 Hexafluorobenzene was only first synthesized in 1956,41 but now, it is widely used as a valuable solvent
and standard in 19F NMR. Hexaaminobenzene was first synthesized
in 1929, and its crystalline state was already characterized in 1931.42,43 Hexaphenylbenzene has been known since 193044 and hexa(trifluoromethyl)benzene, since 1960.45 Hexacyanobenzene was first synthesized and patented in
1963.46,47 A synthesis of explosive and propellant
hexanitrobenzene was published in 1979,48 hexacetylenobenzene (hexaethynyl-benzene) in 1986,49 and the first synthesis of benzenehexathiol in 1989,50 although the hexathiolates were known earlier.51,52

Inspection of Table 1 reveals that OCN, OC≡CH, OMgH, and OH hexasubstituted
benzenes
exhibit HOMA = 1.000. Thus, they are geometrically isoaromatic with
benzene. However, they are not magnetically isoaromatic as their NICS(1)ZZ indices are basically different: −22.2, −22.0,
−19.7, −20.2, and −29.2, respectively. Analogously,
there are many other pairs of molecules which are geometrically, but
not magnetically, isoaromatic. Among these are, for example, SH and
CN (HOMA = 0.944; NICS(1)ZZ = −16.1 and −20.5
ppm, respectively) or CF3 and NC (HOMA = 0.951; NICS(1)ZZ = −22.8 and −18.7 ppm, respectively). Also,
pairs of magnetically, but not geometrically, isoaromatic molecules
can be found: OMe and OCHO (NICS(1)ZZ = −22.0 ppm
and HOMA = 0.988 and 0.994) and O– and OF (NICS(1)ZZ = −17.3 ppm and HOMA = −2.106 and 0.854).
We think that the differences in magnetic and geometric isoaromaticities
may be interesting in the design of new materials.

The search
for geometrically ″overaromatic″ molecules
stems from the observation that the NICS(1) and NICS(0) of some very
common molecules, with symmetry close to D6h, indicate that their magnetic aromaticity is greater
than that of benzene, whereas the geometric aromaticity HOMA index
suggests the opposite. Indeed, the NICS(1) values of as many as 12
hexahomosubstituted molecules listed in Table 1, namely, OCaH, NH3+, OMe, OMgH, OLi, OCaF, OC≡CH, F, OCN, CHO, C6,
and BeH(☆), are lower than −11.305 ppm estimated for
benzene at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. Simultaneously, their HOMA values
vary from −0.2 to 1.0 (C6 vs OCN, OC≡CH,
and OMgH, respectively, Table 1). If a similar comparison is made for the NICS(0) index,53 more than 30 hexahomosubstituted benzenes have
values lower than −9.846 ppm determined for benzene. There
may be several reasons for errors and discrepancies in NICS values:
insufficient basis set, improper computational method (DFT functional),
dependence of magnetic and tensor properties on the position of the
origin of coordinates, and so forth. However, we first calculated
the NICS(1)ZZ index, which is nearly independent of the
ring σ-orbitals.19 This index is
based solely on the ZZ entry of the shielding tensor corresponding
to the virtual (dummy) atom placed 1 Å above the ring center.
It seems to be a fair single-point characteristic of the magnetic
aromaticity.54

Analysis of the NICS(1)ZZ values yields a different
picture of aromaticity than that based on a comparison of the NICS(1)
or NICS(0) values (Table 1). This is in agreement with the findings for monosubstituted
benzenes studied by Krygowski et al.55 and
Feixas et al.56 All of the considered molecules,
except the unusual ones (Scheme 1), exhibit NICS(1)ZZ values greater than
that of benzene. This means that all of these rings are magnetically
less aromatic than that of benzene. Thus, the crucial assumption in
HOMA definition that benzene is the most geometrically aromatic molecule
is strongly justified. Furthermore, benzene could also be assumed
to be the most magnetically aromatic species, if the odd BeH(☆)
molecule could be ignored.

So, let us now focus on this hypothetical
and exceptional BeH(☆)
molecule. Observe that two types of hexaberylhydride and hexalithium
benzenes are listed in Table 1. The two types are planar and have D6h symmetry, but in the (☆) molecules,
the BeH and Li moieties are attached through the middle of the C=C
bonds, while in the (*) ones, through the C atoms (Scheme 1). Although, the (☆)
structures seem to be unusual, all their fundamental frequencies are
real at the applied level of theory. In contrast, the (*) forms have
structures typical for hexasubstituted benzenes, but some of their
frequencies are imaginary indicating that they are not minima at the
potential energy surfaces. In fact, the (☆) BeH and Li structures
have energies much lower than the (*) ones, be they calculated using
the 6-31G** or the much larger aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. The (*) Li and
BeH isomers do not exhibit exceptional aromaticity features (Table 1) and would not be
worth mentioning if the NICS(1)ZZ of the BeH(☆)
structure were not extraordinary. In conclusion, we speculate that
the unusual BeH(☆) structure, which in normal circumstances
would violently decompose, could be reconsidered and reevaluated in
a future material chemistry search for a sophisticated superaromatic
substance existing in some atypical environment. Thus, (☆)
BeH and Li structures cannot be recommended as the aromaticity standard
and the benzene molecule remains the single candidate for such a standard.

Does the Kekulé Ring Moiety Exist?
In the mid-1860s,
Kekulé proposed the cyclic structural formula of benzene with
alternating single and double bonds between the C atoms.57,58 The Kekulé model improperly suggested the D3h symmetry of benzene, but at the end
of the 19th century, Thiele introduced the bond resonance concept
which removed this misconception.59 Nevertheless,
the Kekulé structural formula has been and still is ubiquitous
in chemical literature as it is handy and everyone is aware of its
conventionality. Besides, the Kekulé benzene plays an important
role in the HOMA aromaticity index, which is defined to be exactly
0 for this hypothetical form.1−3 Yet, in general, HOMA is a multivalent
function of n variables (n = 6 for
the six-membered ring) and can be zero for (potentially) an infinite
number of sets of six CC distances. Note that HOMA can be equal to
0 even for the D6h symmetry
moiety if the six bonds equally differ from Ropt by ±α–1/2 (eq 1).

In the original paper,
discussing the parameters of the HOMA index,60 the values of Ropt = 1.388 Å and
α = 257.7 Å–2 were justified by the experimental
data. Now, in the vast majority of articles, aromaticity is discussed
based on computational data for which Ropt and α should be readjusted. The Ropt value is usually assumed to be the CC distance in benzene optimized
at a given level of theory. However, determining α and R(C–C) and R(C=C) in the cyclohexatriene
moiety needs more assumptions. Krygowski’s assumptions60 lead to the following results 2  To find rings satisfying eq 2, a series of triply fused hexasubstituted
benzenes possessing the C3 axis (TFB molecules, Scheme 2) were calculated
using α = 257.7 Å–2 and the B3LYP/6-31G**
calculated Ropt,6-31G** = 1.39632
Å. To facilitate the discussion, the systematic TFB names are
simplified to the names of the triply fused moiety. Thus, here, triphenylene
and trinaphthylene are called benzene and naphthalene derivative,
respectively.

Benzenes (TFB)
FS denotes an arbitrary fused
system.

Note at the beginning that low TFB
symmetries like C3 or C3v appear
when the fused systems are bulky and interact with each other. As
a result, the whole molecule can be distorted or even chiral. This
does not influence the HOMA index, which can be calculated straightforwardly,
but the NICS(1) group of indices split into two values characterizing
two faces of the ring rather than the ring itself.21

Observe also that despite the C3 symmetry
of the TFB moiety, the HOMA index can change continuously from nearly
1.0 to less than −1.0 (Tables 2 and S1). For example, the
central ring in tris(cyclopenteno) benzene has HOMA = 0.987 and is
aromatic while that in tris(cyclobutadieno) benzene has HOMA = −1.251
and is antiaromatic.

level and for HOMA, EN, and GEO, α = 257.7 Å–2 and Ropt,6–31G** = 1.39632 Å
were assumed. No 1 = No 85 in Table S1.

In this context, we scan the
chemical realm far beyond the Mills–Nixon
hypothesis,61 approximately saying that
a small ring fused with benzene promotes the single- and double-bond
alternation. A closer inspection into the ring condensation reveals
that such a fusion influences an interplay between the single- and
double-well potentials in benzene in many different ways.62−64 Yet, here we focus on the C3 symmetry
fused systems yielding HOMA of the central ring close to 0. In terms
of the HOMA index, this denotes the perfect bond alternation. However,
a more detailed look into the systems with HOMA ≈ 0 reveals
unobvious peculiarities.

Let “f” and “b” denote the “ring fusion”
and the “bay”
CC bonds in the central benzene ring of TFB, respectively (Scheme 1). Tables 2 and S1 indicate that probably none of the relations between Rf, Rb, and Ropt listed in Table 3 can be ruled out a priori.

Thus, a TFB derivative can exhibit: D3 symmetry, alternating bond lengths, and HOMA of the
central ring
close to 0, but it can simultaneously belong to the TFB(ii) or TFB(iii)
type (Table 3). However,
based on Krygowski’s assumptions (eq 2), these types are forbidden for the model
cyclohexatriene moiety, which must belong to the TFB(i) type and must
satisfy that R(C–C) > Ropt>R(C=C)
(Figure 1a).60 Only in such a case will the τfb ratio be negative (Table 3), and for the perfect cyclohexatriene match,
it will be either −2 or −1/2 (eq 2).

Surprisingly, stable
and relatively unstrained TFB candidates for
the cyclohexatriene moiety, in which triply condensed moieties are
fused through the six-membered ring, belong to the TFB(ii) group.
Indeed, the HOMA index of the central rings in: benzothiophene (1),
phenanthrene (2), hydroxyindoles (3, 27), benzofuran (5), fluoroindoles
(10, 27), nitroindoles (12, 38), methylindole (16), benzoimidazole
(18), N-methylindole (20), indole (21), diborinine
(23), diaminonaphthalene (31), dihydroxynaphthalene (32), di(dimetyloamino)naphthalene
(34), difluoronaphthalene (37), dicyanonaphthalene (39), dichloronaphthalene
(4), dimethylnaphthalene (41), phthalazine (42), naphthylborane (43),
and naphthalene (44) TFB derivatives ranges from 0.1 to −0.1
(Table 2).

Also
unexpectedly, the TFB(i) molecules exhibiting HOMA ≈
0 are fused to the central ring through the pentalene system (Table 2). The nonalternant
antiaromatic pentalenes with their 4n π electrons
are reactive even at low temperatures.65−67 Even if they were interesting
for material design, they seem inappropriate as model reference molecules.

It is worth recalling that HOMA = 1 – EN – GEO5,6 and that the EN and GEO indices can also be helpful in the search
for the best TFB approximation of cyclohexatriene (Tables 2 and S2). Note that EN and GEO factors, named after words “energetic”
and “geometric”, respectively, are purely structural
indices based solely on the CC distances 3  where Rav is the
mean CC bond length and the other symbols are defined in eq 1.

Equations 2 and 3 indicate that
for cyclohexatriene, EN = 0.1 and
GEO = 0.9, which provide an additional criterion for the search. However,
alike Rf and Rb, the relationships between EN, GEO, and the molecular structure
are implicit. This is because they are functions of the sum of the
molecular distances (the average) and or the sum of their squares.
Yet, juxtaposition of Figure 1a with the plot of EN-GEO against HOMA (Figure 1 b) shows that structures with EN-GEO ≈
−0.8 correspond to allowed cyclohexatriene models (Rf > Ropt > Rb) while those close to EN-GEO ≈ 0.8
correspond to forbidden structures (Rf, Rb > Ropt). It is striking that desired TFB(i) molecules
with negative τfb ratio have GEO,
EN, and EN/GEO ratio close to that in cyclohexatriene (Table 2). Thus, analysis of EN and
GEO values can serve as alternative searching parameters, however,
slightly less direct than the Rf, Rb, and Ropt distances.

This part of the study was done based on trial-and-error, as well
as analogy, search methods. A more systematic and exhaustive investigation
would provide more molecules satisfying the necessary condition for
the best cyclohexatriene model. However, we do not have much hope
that they will be simple and convenient.

This section demonstrates
that finding a good model for the hypothetical
cyclohexatriene moiety for which HOMA = 0 is difficult. Moreover,
even if a candidate molecule has the HOMA index close enough to null,
it often exhibits Rf and Rb bond lengths either both greater or both smaller than
the optimal CC distance in the benzene molecule. In terms of EN and
GEO, it has EN-GEO ≈ 0.8 (Table 2). On the other hand, systems that satisfy the condition
that Ropt distance is between Rf and Rb ones (or
EN-GEO ≈ −0.8) are likely to be unstable and thus inconvenient
as a reference molecule.

Thus, if we are interested in the HOMA
definition rather than in
a material design, it may be practical to refer in the HOMA definition
not to the mysterious cyclohexatriene molecule, but to an existing
one. The HOMA value of such a molecule could be determined with the
same computational or experimental method as used for benzene. The α coefficient in eq 1 could be determined based on the two standard molecules.
We suggest that the cyclohexane chair conformer of the D3d symmetry,68 easy to calculate at any theoretical level used to calculate HOMA,
can be such a model molecule. The HOMA of the cyclohexane chair conformer
is equal to −4.08706 at the B3LYP/6-31G** level (Ropt,6–31G** = 1.39632 Å and α = 257.7
Å–2). Assuming that this value is exactly −4.000
implies α = 253.29 Å–2 and HOMA of cyclohexatriene
still equal to 0.000. Thus, it is pragmatic to(1) set HOMA equal to 1.000 for the CC
distance in the benzene molecule of D6h symmetry,

(2) set HOMA equal to −4.000 for
the CC distance in the chair cyclohexane of D3d symmetry,

(3) determine the α parameter based
on (1), (2), and eq 1 for the chosen level of calculations.



The above allows for conserving eq 1, but the α and Ropt parameters must be reestablished at each level of
theory applied using the HOMA values of the chair cyclohexane of D3d symmetry equal to −4.000.
Such an approach allows for obtaining congruent HOMA values at any
computational or experimental level applied.

Can a Geometrical Aromaticity
Index Be Defined Better Than HOMA?
In our earlier studies,
we showed the HOMA index to be more than
just a geometrical aromaticity index.7,8 Indeed, the
primary connection of HOMA with aromaticity is in choosing aromatic
benzene as a reference for which HOMA equals 1. A secondary connection
is through the normalization parameter making HOMA equal to 0 for
the hypothetical, totally nonaromatic, Kekuléne form of benzene.
However, using the HOMA index, we obtained valuable characteristics
for both unsaturated and saturated structures, were they cyclic or
acyclic.7,8 Furthermore, we have shown the HOMA index
to be a topological index in a kind of modified graph theory.9 So what makes the HOMA definition universal enough
to suit for the construction of different descriptors? This is because
the HOMA index can be interpreted as a linear function of well-defined
mathematical objects such as: (a) the square of a distance in an abstract n-dimensional space or (b) a variance, i.e., the second
central moment.

(a) Consider an abstract n-dimensional
molecular space, MS, in which a molecule is represented by a point X = (x1, x2, ... xn), where the subsequent
coordinates correspond to the selected CC bond lengths in this molecule.
A comparison between two molecules, X and Y, can be expressed as a distance, d(X, Y) in the MS. In an n-dimensional Euclidean space, it is most natural to use the distance
given by the square root of a sum of squares of the Cartesian coordinate
differences: .

Such a comparison also
makes sense if we are interested only in
a difference between restricted fragments of the molecules, such as
rings, to evaluate their aromaticity. Instead of discussing the details
of the MS concept, here it is enough to state that 4  where d(·) is a distance
in MS, X is a ring in a given molecule and Y = (y1, y2, ... yn) stands for benzene in
which all coordinates are equal to each other: y1 = y2 = ··· = yn = y = d(CC),
while const corresponds to α/n from eq 1. Additionally,
if we assume that there exists an abstract reference molecule Y for which y1 = y2 = ··· = ym = y = d(CCBenzene)
but m ≠ 6, then we can calculate
the HOMA index for any molecule composed of an arbitrary number of
C atoms.

(b) In statistics, a kth central moment
of probability
function of a random variable x, μk, i.e., the expected deviation of kth degree from
the expectation value, is defined as follows: μk⟨(x – ⟨x⟩)k⟩ = 1/n∑i = 1n(xi–x̅)k, where the angle brackets ⟨•⟩ and x̅ denote the arithmetic mean.
An ordinary kth moment, mk=⟨xk⟩ = 1/n∑i = 1n(xi)k, is not taken about the mean and .

Thus, if xi is identified with the ith length Ri in a molecule
(a ring) and  with the optimal bond length Ropt, then HOMA is connected to the variance that is the
second central moment for the multiple discrete random variables x1, x2, ... xn, i.e., as follows 5  where α
is as in eq 1. Note that eq 5 allows n to be other than 6 because
it can be understood as a number of different comparisons with the
optimal bond length. So, the HOMA index can be calculated for any
molecule composed of an arbitrary number of CC bonds.

Since
HOMA can be expressed as a linear function of d2 or μ2, a better description of the
geometrical aromaticity can be searched for among the extensions of
the HOMA index, which is treated as an abstract distance69 or as a statistical parameter.70 Let us follow the second approach.

For the molecules
considered in this study, supplemented by several
simple molecules such as alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes,
polyallenes, polyalkynes, their substituted derivatives, etc., let
us plot μk central moments (k =
2, 3, 4 and μ2, μ3, and μ4 are variance, skewness, and kurtosis, respectively, taken
about m1, i.e., the mean of CC distance
in benzene) against the first central moment μ1 (Figure 2). Note that the
range of changes of μk decreases by 1 order from k to (k + 1). Observe also that there are
always some scattered points over the expected regular polynomial
relationship between μ1 and μk (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Plot of the μ2, μ3, and μ4 central moments
against the first central moment μ1, (a), (b), and
(c), respectively, for the series of studied
molecules at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. All values are multiplied 100
times.

Mark that a trivial geometrical
index expressed as μ1 (xi – x̅) is already bringing
to
light crucial similarities and differences among molecules or among
their selected parts (Figure 2a). For molecules for which 100·μ2 varies
from 0 to 5, 100·μ1 ranges from −20 to
+20 (Figure 2a). However,
to emphasize more subtle differences between the molecules, consider
an index expressed as a sum of the first four central moments 6  where  and m1,ref is
the mean in the reference molecule. Dividing μk by kth power of m1,ref guarantees
the dimensionlessness of the Γ index.

Note that, for the
reference molecule, Γ = 0. The majority
of points in the plot of Γ against HOMA (Figure 3a) is placed on the branches of the inverse
of a parabola as the largest Γ term is due to μ1. To better expose interrelations between HOMA and Γ, consider
a geometrical auxiliary index, GAI, defined as follows 7  where the sgn(·) function assigns the
value 1 to any positive number, 0 to zero, and −1 to any negative
number.

Figure 3 (a) Relationship between Γ index constructed as a sum of
the first four central moments μn (about m1,ref) and the HOMA index. (b) Relationship
between the GAI and HOMA indices.

Remark that:1. GAI = 0 for the reference benzene molecule,

2. GAI has neither a lower nor upper limit,

3. For the same HOMA, GAI
can take values
from positive, through zero, to negative,

4. Plot of GAI vs HOMA reveals different
trends for different classes of molecules,

5. For HOMA ≈ 1.0, GAI ≈
0.0 and GAI is likely to be useful as an auxiliary aromaticity index,

6. For HOMA ≪ 1.0,
HOMA and GAI
are general geometrical, rather than aromaticity, indices and are
possibly useful for the characterization of different classes of molecules
(Figure 3b).

7. The same can be said about
the Γ
index.



It is likely that the split of
plots into series of regular tendencies
reveals classes of differently strained molecules (Figure 3b). The upper boundary seems
to be due to unstrained molecules (the black line going through the
empty circles), while the lower one corresponds to linear polyunsaturated
compounds such as polyallenes (the red line going through the red
circles). Let us add that a slight nonlinear curvature of those trends
results from eq 6, defining
in fact a higher polynomial.

To illustrate that for molecules
far from being aromatic (such
as n-alkanes), the GAI and HOMA indices may be valuable
geometrical descriptors, we correlated the boiling points of these
molecules71 with the two indices (Figure 4). We used the extended
all-transoid geometries of the most stable conformers. Yet, the number
of alkane conformers increases exponentially with the alkane size,
the intramolecular distances depend on conformation, and the distance-based
geometrical indices vary. Therefore, to verify if the choice of the
most stable conformers could provide fortunate but false trends, we
estimated the studied n-alkanes conformational spaces
at the molecular mechanics (MM) level. Next, all of the conformers
were reoptimized with the B3LYP/6-31G** method. Then, the two indices
were averaged using the Boltzmann population factors of the conformers9 8  where INDEX stands here for HOMA or GAI, wi is the population factor of ith conformer calculated
using either the total or the Gibbs free
energy, m is the number of conformers, and the subscripts w and i stand for the population weighted
and the current individual conformer, respectively. Note that eq 8 defines the index which
contains energetic factors and thus is not purely geometrical. Still,
a purely geometrical weighting factor can be obtained by normalization
against the sum of indices of the entire population.

Figure 4 Nonlinear correlations
between boiling points of n-alkanes and (a) GAI and
(b) HOMA indices obtained using geometry
of the most stable conformers (blue) and indices averaged over all n-alkane conformers using weighting factors based on total
energies (red) and Gibbs free energies (green).

It appeared that the correlations estimated for the most stable
conformers have the same nonlinear and monotonic characters as those
based on the Boltzmann population factors (Figure 4). Hence, to check whether analogous relationships
exist for arbitrary alkanes (up to nonane), we considered all of their
constitutional isomers represented by MM-selected the most stable
structures reoptimized at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. The plot of the
so calculated HOMA index against the boiling points reveals more complex
associations between the two variables (Figure 5).

We observe that the HOMA value of
the n-alkane
is the greatest among the constitutional isomers (HOMA > −4.0, Figure 5a). The correlation
observed in Figure 4 can also be recognized on the right-hand side of Figure 5a. On the other hand, the most
branched constitutional isomer has the smallest HOMA value (Figure 5a). The boiling points
of the most branched constitutional isomers can also be nonlinearly
correlated with HOMA (Figure 5b). Note that the boiling point of the most branched alkane
is not always the lowest boiling point among the isomers (Table S2). Observe also that the boiling points
of alkane constitutional isomers tend to increase with HOMA from the
most branched to the most extended isomer. However, for lower alkanes,
the correlation with HOMA seems to be strong (R =
0.95 for hexanes) while already for nonanes it is weak (R = 0.3) if it exists at all (Figure 5a). The analogous holds true for the GAI index, which
for alkanes behaves quite similarly.

Figure 5 (a) Associations between the boiling points
of n-alkanes and the HOMA index. (b) Nonlinear correlations
between the
boiling points of the most branched constitutional isomer of given
alkane and its HOMA value. The HOMA values are based on structures
of the most stable conformers. The same color in (a) and (b) denotes
the same kind of alkane.

The connections between
alkane branching and HOMA can be well explained.
In the set of constitutional isomers, the n-alkanes
are the most relaxed while the most branched constitutional isomers
have the strongest intramolecular hindrances and internal repulsions.
Therefore the average CC bond length in the former group is smaller
than in the latter. In consequence, the difference between the CC
distance in n-alkane and benzene is smaller than
that for the most branched constitutional isomer. Hence, HOMA of the
former is greater than HOMA of the latter.

However, the correlations
and trends shown in Figures 4 and 5 should be verified in a study
devoted exclusively to this problem.
First, the computational method should account for dispersion forces
important for alkane intramolecular interactions and conformation.
Second, the basis set used should be larger and should contain diffuse
functions important to properly consider interactions between side
chains. Third, the conformational landscape should be probed more
carefully and should include methyl group rotations omitted here.
Last but not least, several alkanes are chiral70 and their number increases faster than the number of alkanes
for which the optical isomerism is ignored.72 Yet, if the number of asymmetric carbon atoms is greater than 1,
the boiling points of different optical isomers may differ significantly.
At the moment, the boiling points of chiral alkanes are determined
only rarely71 and the tabularized b.p.
values correspond to racemic mixtures averaged over optical isomer
populations. However, when simulating the conformational space, the
chirality of alkanes must be taken into account and the derived parameters
must be properly averaged. All of the above makes the study of flexible
molecules quite a strenuous task that can hardly be accomplished in
this study.

Summing up this section, there are at least two
ways to obtain
new geometrical indices: (a) by generalizing connections between the
HOMA index and a distance in an abstract molecular space or (b) by
generalizing the HOMA index connections to statistical central indices.
Following the second way, we demonstrated that valuable indices, such
as Γ or GAI, can be obtained. However, except for the fact that
they have no upper and lower limits, the indices themselves are merely
different from HOMA rather than better. Yet, juxtaposition of GAI
and HOMA indices in common plot reveals additional molecular features
such as molecular strain. However, a closer examination of this finding
goes beyond the aim of this paper.

Conclusions
HOMA
is one of the most popular indices for determining aromaticity
and practically the only one which reflects the geometrical aspect
of aromaticity. However, the HOMA index also performs well for any
type of molecules, be they aromatic, only cyclic, or even linear.
If so, it is important to better understand its behavior. To this
aim, we have asked three questions which could provide a deeper insight
into comprehension of this descriptor. This is also important because
of the possible use of this simple index in molecular prescreening
for further material design.

The questions are a bit provocative.
The question “Does
an “overaromatic″ carbon ring exist?” could not
be answered based solely on the HOMA index, which inherently assumes
that benzene is the most aromatic system. Therefore, the HOMA indices
of hexahomosubstituted benzenes were juxtaposed with different magnetic
aromaticity NICS indices, which have no such limitation. As a result,
we find that although the less precise NICS(1) index would suggest
that some of the considered molecules could be “overaromatic,”
use of the NICSZZ(1) index almost unequivocally indicates
that benzene deserves to be considered as the most aromatic molecule.

The answer to the question “Does the Kekulé ring
moiety exist?” was based on analysis of triply fused hexasubstituted
benzenes (TFB) with the C3 axis. Such
molecules have two types of CC bonds in the central ring, “f” and “b”, corresponding
to the “ring fusion” and the “bay” part
of TFB, respectively. However, we demonstrated that a TFB derivative
can exhibit high D3 symmetry, alternating
bond lengths, and HOMA close to 0, but it can simultaneously have Rf, Rb, and Ropt both greater than or smaller than the Ropt of benzene. Yet, these types are forbidden
to the model cyclohexatriene moiety, which must satisfy R(C–C) >Ropt > R(C=C). However, most of the molecules found which exhibited
HOMA ≈ 0 and satisfied this condition contained the reactive
pentalene system fused to the central ring. We also demonstrated that
analysis of EN and GEO indices closely related to HOMA can provide
the same conclusions. Hence, even if such THB molecules were interesting
for material design, they present as inappropriate model reference
molecules. We conclude that insofar as we are interested in the HOMA
definition rather than material design, it could be practical to replace
the mysterious cyclohexatriene molecule with an existing one. We suggest
that the cyclohexane chair conformer of the D3d symmetry could be such a model molecule.
The assumption that HOMA of the cyclohexane chair conformer is equal
to exactly −4.000 implies α = 253.29 Å–2. This allows us to conserve the current definition, and HOMA of
the Kekuléne cyclohexatriene is still equal to 0.000. But for
each level of theory applied, it is necessary to reestablish α
and Ropt parameters using HOMA of the
chair cyclohexane equal to −4.000.

The third question
is: “Can a geometrical aromaticity index
be defined better then HOMA?” To find an answer to it, we have
first demonstrated why the HOMA index is very successful. This is
because it is connected to well-defined mathematical objects such
as the distance in an abstract molecular space or the second central
statistical moment. Based on the first four central statistical moments,
we proposed a new geometrical auxiliary index (GAI) which has several
properties similar to HOMA, but neither an upper or lower limit. As
HOMA, it performs well both for aromatic and nonaromatic molecules
as well as for cyclic and linear ones. Juxtaposition of the GAI and
HOMA indices shows splitting of the plot into several regular tendencies,
which ostensibly reveal classes of differently strained molecules.
Moreover, GAI can probably serve as an auxiliary geometrical aromaticity
index. Finally, we have illustrated that for molecules such as types
of alkanes, both the GAI and HOMA indices may be valuable geometrical
descriptors correlating with the alkanes boiling points. Nevertheless,
for n-alkanes, the most branched alkanes one can
find good correlations with boiling points, the general relation is
complicated if it exists at all. However, further studies of this
interesting feature go beyond the purposes of this study.
