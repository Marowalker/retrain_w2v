A challenge for detecting phthalates
in commercial products such
as cheese powders is that the composition of the products is highly
complex, and current methods for detection rely on gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry, which is not portable and cannot be used by individual
consumers at a time and place of their choosing. Herein, we report
the development of a new method for phthalate detection in cheese
powder using cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence detection, in which
the presence of the phthalate analytes leads to highly analyte-specific
changes in the fluorescence emission signal of a fluorophore bound
in a cyclodextrin cavity. This method relies on subtle changes in
the analyte affinity for the fluorophore and the cyclodextrin cavity
and provides for markedly more straightforward sample preparation
procedures and an extremely rapid read-out signal, with potential
for the development of portable fluorescence sensors. Using this method,
we were able to detect 15 phthalate esters with highly analyte-specific
responses and at concentrations as low as 0.12 μM, which is
well below regulatory levels of concern. Computational investigations
strongly support the observed experimental trends.

Introduction
Toxic chemicals have
been found in a wide variety of commercial
products,1 including processed foods2 and beverages.3 Examples
of such chemicals include phthalates,4 phenol
and phenol derivatives,5 and a variety
of other organic and inorganic analytes.6 Exposure to these chemicals is concerning because of their known
and suspected toxicity,7 which can cause
deleterious health effects to humans8 and
other species exposed to the chemicals.9 Moreover, the long-term environmental persistence of such chemicals
means that potential exposure can occur long after the usage of the
chemicals and the initial release into the environment.10 Current methods to detect these compounds include
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry,11 although newer methods such as electrochemically based methods12 and spectroscopic (including Raman-based) methods13 have also been reported. Although these known
methods operate with high sensitivity, concerns about the ability
of the average consumer to access such methods persist.

Our
group has recently developed a fundamentally new method for
toxicant detection in complex environments, using cyclodextrin-promoted
energy transfer from the toxicant of interest to a high-quantum-yield
fluorophore, for photophysically active analytes (Figure 1A),14 and cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence modulation, for nonphotophysically
active analytes (Figure 1B).15 These proximity-induced, noncovalent
interactions among the cyclodextrin host, toxicant analyte, and fluorophore
reporter result in highly analyte-specific fluorescence read-out signals,
which have been used for toxicant detection in a broad variety of
complex environments. Such environments include human plasma,16 breast milk,17 urine,18 extracts collected from oil19 and fuel spills,20 and contaminated
marine environments.21 Compared to most
currently utilized methods, fluorescence-based toxicant detection
has the potential to lead to more rapid read-out signals, highly portable
devices, and improved detection sensitivity and selectivity.22

fluorescence energy transfer and (B) cyclodextrin-promoted analyte-specific
fluorescence modulation.

The detection of toxicants
in complex food matrices such as macaroni
and cheese products using cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence detection
has not been reported to date, although such detection is particularly
relevant in light of recent news reports that phthalates have been
found in commercial cheese powder.23 Although
these initial reports were of chemical contamination in only a single
cheese powder brand, there are a broad variety of commercial macaroni
and cheese products available, and the composition of the cheese powder
in these products is somewhat variable. Moreover, the concentration
of available phthalates in the final cooked product will depend on
the cooking method, the chemical composition of the cookware, and
other highly sample-specific parameters, which means that developing
detection methods that can be operated by the end user is of significant
interest. Current methods for toxicant detection in macaroni and cheese
products are time consuming and require specialized laboratory equipment,
which precludes individual consumers from analyzing their own macaroni
and cheese products at a time and place of their choosing, i.e., after
the food has been prepared.24

Reported
herein is a detailed GC–MS analysis of the samples
that confirms the existence of phthalate esters in all of the powders
investigated. In parallel, we report the development of a new fluorescence-based
detection method for phthalate esters in commercial cheese powder,
which operates with high sensitivity (as low as 0.12 μM limits
of detection) and general applicability (for operating in complex
environments and for correctly identifying individual analytes and
analyte mixtures). In support of the experimental results, computational
investigations provide additional insight into the mechanism that
underlies the highly analyte-specific cyclodextrin-promoted detection.
Together, these two detection methods and computational supporting
investigations provide a detailed picture of the samples in question
and an important proof-of-concept of a new sensor for phthalate detection
in complex food matrices.

Results and Discussion
Four brands
of macaroni and cheese, including both organic and
nonorganic varieties, were bought from a highly popular United States-based
retail store, with the goal of sampling products that are reaching
large numbers of consumers and have a significant potential health
effect if found to be contaminated. Phthalate esters chosen for analysis
(compounds 1–15, Figure 2) include those that have been
found in macaroni and cheese powder25 as
well as a variety of other analogues, with the goal of determining
the generality of the fluorescence-based method and GC–MS-based
analysis across a broad swath of structures with a relatively wide
range of potential toxicities.26 For the
fluorescence-based detection method, we selected γ-cyclodextrin
as the supramolecular host due to the known ability of cyclodextrin
to bind hydrophobic small molecules in its interior27 and the specific ability of γ-cyclodextrin to facilitate
the binding of two small-molecule guests to form a ternary complex.28 A commercially available boron-dipyrromethene
(BODIPY) fluorophore was selected as the source of the read-out signal,
based on the well-documented ability of BODIPY fluorophores to display
high quantum yield and robust performance under a variety of experimental
conditions.29

Figure 2 Structures of all phthalate
ester analytes (1–15), control analyte
(16), and high quantum yield
fluorophore (17) used in these investigations.

GC–MS analysis of the four selected cheese
powders indicated
that all powders contained multiple phthalate esters (Table 1) as well as significant amounts
of fatty acids, including hexanoic acid and octanoic acid. Total concentrations
of the phthalate esters in the cheese powder extract were relatively
modest, ranging from 0.46% (for organic name-brand cheese powder)
to 9.05% (for regular name-brand cheese powder). The identity of all
peaks was confirmed using the NIST14 library as well as by matching
the retention times and mass spectra to known standards.30 Of note, many of these analytes have the potential
to affect the fluorescence of fluorophore 17 when added
to the complex matrix, through the formation of micellar structures31 and/or through general environmental changes.32 Such effects partially underlie the ability
of the fluorescence-based detection to distinguish between different
cheese powders investigated herein.

a The presence of an “X”
indicates that the analyte has been found in the particular cheese
sample investigated.

Because
phthalates were detected in all of the cheese powder samples
investigated, we then decided to dope higher amounts of a broader
variety of phthalates into the cheese powders, with the goal of understanding
how the presence of the phthalates affects the emission signal of
fluorophore 17 and how such analyte-induced changes can
be used for phthalate detection. Of note, the actual amount of phthalate
esters in each sample investigated is comprised of the amount doped
into the sample as well as the amount that is already found therein.
Analyte-induced changes in the fluorescence emission, which were quantified
using eq 2, are summarized
in Table 2 and indicate
that in every case, the introduction of the analyte resulted in increased
fluorescence emission of fluorophore 17. This phenomenon
can be attributed to the large cavity size of γ-cyclodextrin,
which facilitates association between the analyte and the fluorophore,
further restricting the free rotation of the fluorophore and increasing
the observed fluorescence emission. Moreover, the continued interaction
between the analyte and the fluorophore afforded by the ternary complex
facilitates low limits of detection for all phthalate ester analytes
(vide infra). Ample literature precedent supports the notion that
increased steric hindrance and/or rigidification around fluorophores
can lead to enhanced fluorescence emission due to decreases in nonradiative
decay pathways available.33,34 Notable outliers include
analytes 10 and 11, with markedly higher
modulation values compared to the other analytes, and analytes 12–14, which displayed relatively low
modulation values. These analytes were subjected to detailed computational
analysis (vide infra) to explain these anomalous trends.

a Fluorescence modulation
values were
calculated according to eq 2, and each value represents the average of at least six trials.
All modulation experiments were subjected to 1 h equilibration time
prior to analysis, in accordance with the results of equilibration
studies (see Supporting Information for more details).

Analyte-specific changes in the
fluorescence emission of fluorophore 17 in the presence
of cyclodextrin in the cheese powder matrices
were further analyzed to determine limits of detection (LODs) for
each analyte. These LODs ranged from 11.89 to 0.12 μM, depending
on the identity of the analyte, cheese powder, and fluorophore selected
(Table 3). For comparison,
the Consumer Product Safety Committee reports that the maximum acceptable
intake of phthalate esters ranges from 152 mg/kg-day for diisononyl
phthalate to as low as 0.5 mg/kg-day in the case of dibutyl phthalate.
Using approximations of a one-cup serving size of macaroni and cheese
and an approximate adult human weight of 63 kg,35 our highest LOD (i.e., least sensitive detection capability)
is still an order of magnitude lower than concentrations that can
be safely consumed. For comparison, detection limits of phthalates
obtained via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry methods were
reported to be as low as 0.1 μM with excellent separation observed
between analyte signals,36 although such
methods required additional preparation procedures prior to analysis.
Electrochemical methods reported even lower limits of detection (4.5
nM) for a single phthalate ester (dibutyl phthalate),37 although without the broad substrate scope reported herein.
Moreover, the concentration of phthalates found in commercial macaroni
and cheese products ranged from approximately 1 to 160 μg/kg,38 which encompasses the detection limit range
reported herein.

a All limits of detection were calculated
using eq 3, and results
reported represent an average of at least six trials.

Of note, the strong fluorescence
modulation values for analytes 10 and 11 also led to lower LOD values, with
compound 11 having the lowest limit of detection observed
(0.12 μM). In contrast, the analytes with higher LOD values
tended to be the smaller structures, with dimethyl phthalate and monomethyl
phthalate having much higher average LOD across all samples. Moreover,
the monosubstituted phthalates (compounds 12–15) were shown to have larger LODs compared to their disubstituted
analogues. This trend is likely due to weaker binding of the monosubstituted
analogues in the cyclodextrin cavity, due to increased hydrophilicity
and decreased steric complementarity, which, in turn, weakens this
hydrophobically promoted complexation. The relatively polar nature
of analytes 12–15, as visualized
through their electrostatic potential surface maps, is shown in Figure 3, where the red and
blue colors indicate areas of high polarity. These results are in
line with previously reported work from our group, which highlighted
hydrophobic association as a particularly relevant mechanism for the
inclusion and detection of highly hydrophobic analytes such as the
analytes and fluorophores reported herein.39

potential mapping of analytes 12–15 highlighting polar areas in blue and red. Analyte 2 is shown as a less polar comparison.

Further computational investigations of analytes 10 and 11 were conducted using Molecular Operating Environment
(MOE), in which the complex of cyclodextrin and fluorophore 17 was minimized in an aqueous environment (Figure 4A). The introduction of analytes 10 and 11 led to close association between the
analytes and the fluorophore (Figure 4B,C), which ensures the high modulation values and
low limits of detection that are observed experimentally. In comparison,
the introduction of analyte 8 to the BODIPY–cyclodextrin
complex led to the displacement of the fluorophore from the cavity
(Figure 4D); the resulting
weaker interaction between the analyte and the fluorophore leads,
in turn, to a decreased responsiveness to the presence of the analyte.

(D) Fluorophore 17, analyte 8, and γ-cyclodextrin.

Such differences in the behavior of analytes 10 and 11 were further seen in the analyte-induced
fluorescence modulation
(Figure 5), wherein
the introduction of analytes 10 and 11 to
a solution of fluorophore 17 in γ-cyclodextrin
resulted in a substantial increase in the emission intensity (reflected
in high fluorescence modulation values, Table 2) as well as a red-shift in the position
of the fluorescence emission maxima for these two analytes. For comparison,
analyte 8 induced a lower fluorescence intensity increase
as well as no noticeable change in the position of the emission maximum
of fluorophore 17, highlighting the unique properties
of analytes 10 and 11 in cyclodextrin-based
complexes.

Conclusions
In conclusion, reported
herein is the detection of phthalate ester
analytes in four commercial cheese powder samples using initial characterization
by GC–MS and a newly developed method of cyclodextrin-promoted,
fluorescence-based detection. Compared to our previously reported
fluorescence detection methods that operated predominantly in aqueous
solutions, the work reported herein indicates that the cyclodextrin-based
detection strategy is sufficiently robust to operate in highly complex
environments. Compared to GC–MS-based methods, this fluorescence
modulation strategy allows for a broad substrate scope and rapid result
generation, while maintaining high sensitivity and simple sample preparation
procedures. GC–MS analysis, by contrast, required significant
time for method development and individual sample analysis. In parallel
with these experimental methods, computational experiments provided
unique insight about the nature of the cyclodextrin-promoted interaction,
especially for the analytes that provided the greatest modulation
values and lowest limits of detection. Although the fluorescence-based
method reported herein is not yet quantitative, efforts toward achieving
that goal are currently underway in our laboratory; even in the absence
of quantitative detection, such a method provides notable operational
advantages. Current efforts in our laboratory are dedicated toward
decreasing detection limits further and exploring additional cyclodextrin–fluorophore
combinations, and results of these and other investigations will be
reported in due course.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
Fluorescence measurements were
recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrophotofluorimeter with 1.5
nm excitation and 1.5 nm emission slit widths. All analytes and fluorophores
(compounds 1–17, Figure 2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Company and used as received. All cyclodextrins were purchased
from Tokyo Chemical Industry and used as received. Computational experiments
were performed using the Spartan 18 software for electrostatic potential
maps and Molecular Operating Environment for system modeling. All
GC–MS measurements were performed using a Shimadzu GC–MS
QP-2020 gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer.

Extraction
Procedure for GC–MS Analysis
Each
cheese powder sample (5 g) was placed in an 8 mL vial with 3 mL of
deionized water and vortexed for 5 min. Sodium chloride (3 g) was
added to the solution along with 3 mL of analytical-grade acetonitrile.
In a glass vial, 5 g of sample was dissolved in 3 mL of deionized
water followed by vortexing for 3 min and sonicating for 5 min. Acetonitrile
(3 mL) was then added to the solution along with 5 g of sodium chloride.
Samples were exposed to 5 min of further sonication and vortexing,
followed by refrigeration for 10 min. Centrifugation at 5500 rpm yielded
a two-layer system with the top layer collected into a round-bottom
flask. The process was repeated two times, and subsequent extractions
were collected into the same round-bottom flask. The combined extracts
were evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator and brought to
a final volume of 1 mL, which was transferred into an analysis vial.
A standard sample doped with 15 nM of analytes 1–15 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) was also put through the same
extraction procedure as a positive control for retention time, spectra,
and procedural viability.

Instrumental Procedure for GC–MS Analysis
The
oven temperature was set at 150 °C for 1.00 min followed by a
5.00 °C/min ramp to 270 °C with a 5.00 min hold. The injection
temperature was set to 100 °C, with a splitless injection, with
a 150 °C ion source temperature and 230 °C interface. A
4.00 min solvent cut time was used with the m/z ratio range set to 35.00 m/z (low mass cutoff) to 500 m/z (high
mass cutoff).

Procedure for Equilibration Experiments
In a quartz
cuvette, 1.25 mL of a 10 mM cyclodextrin solution dissolved in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, buffered to pH 7.4) and 1.25 mL of a cheese powder sample
(5 g/L in water) were combined with 100 μL of a 0.1 mg/mL solution
of fluorophore 17 and set on a shaker table for single
minute increments prior to sampling. Spectra were obtained by fluorescence
analysis at a 460 nm excitation wavelength. The sampling continued
until the change in the fluorescence signal was less than 5% over
5 min, as calculated by eq 1 1  where Flt+5 minutes represents the integrated fluorescence emission 5 min
after the initial time point and Flinitial represents the
integrated fluorescence emission at the initial time point.

General
Procedure For Fluroscence Modulation Experiments
In a quartz
cuvette, 1.25 mL of a 10 mM cyclodextrin solution dissolved
in PBS and 1.25 mL of a cheese powder sample (5 g/L in water) were
combined and mixed thoroughly by shaking on a shaker station for 1
h. Next, 100 μL of a 0.1 mg/mL of fluorophore 17 solution in tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added, and the solution was
excited four times using a 460 nm excitation wavelength. Then, 50
μL of analytes 1–16 (1.0 mg/mL
in THF) was added to the mixture, and the solution was again excited
four times at 460 nm. The fluorescence emission spectra were integrated
vs wavenumber on the X-axis using the OriginPro software,
and the degree of fluorescence modulation was determined using eq 2 2  where Flanalyte is the integrated
emission of the fluorophore in the presence of the analyte and Flblank is the integrated emission of the fluorophore in the
absence of the analyte. Fluorescence modulation ratios greater than
1 indicate an enhancement of fluorescence emission of the fluorophore
in the presence of the analyte, fluorescence modulation ratios less
than 1 indicate a decrease in fluorescence emission of the fluorophore
in the presence of the analyte, and fluorescence modulation ratios
close to 1 indicate minimal change in the fluorescence emission of
the fluorophore in the presence of the analyte.

General Procedure
for Limit of Detection Experiments
Limit of detection experiments
were conducted following literature-reported
procedures.40 In brief, 1.25 mL of γ-cyclodextrin
and 1.25 mL of 5 g/L cheese powder in water were added to a quartz
cuvette and mixed thoroughly. Next, 100 μL of fluorophore 15 was added to the cuvette and the solution was excited six
times at 460 nm. Next, 10 μL of the analyte was added, and again
the solution was excited six times at 460 nm. This step was repeated
for 20 μL of the analyte, 30 μL of the analyte, 40 μL
of the analyte, 50 μL of the analyte, 60 μL of the analyte,
70 μL of the analyte, 80 μL of the analyte, 90 μL
of the analyte, and 100 μL of the analyte.

All fluorescence
emission spectra were integrated vs wavenumber on the X-axis, and calibration curves were generated. The curves plotted
the analyte concentration, measured in μM, on the X-axis and the fluorescence modulation ratio on the Y-axis. The curve was fitted to a straight line, and the equation
of the line was determined. The limit of detection was calculated
according to eq 3 3  where SDblank is the standard deviation
of the blank sample and m is the slope of the calibration
curve. In all cases, the limit of detection was calculated as a concentration
in micromoles.

General Procedure For Computational Experiments
Molecular
models of the analytes, fluorophores, and cyclodextrin host were generated
using the build function in the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE)
software. Analytes were defined as ligands, and the γ-cyclodextrin
host was defined as the receptor. The ligand–receptor system
underwent a “quick preparation”, which is an initial
energy minimization function, followed by a more in-depth dynamics
calculation using a Berendsen velocity/position scaling algorithm
and Amber 14: EHT forcefield. The calculations done in the solvent
were prepared using a 90 angstrom cubic cell populated with roughly
2500 water molecules to display the most likely conformation in aqueous
environments. Computational models of the molecules were built in
Spartan 18 and underwent a ground-state geometry calculation using
semiempirical PM3 methods in the gas phase followed by an electrostatic
potential map, ESP, surface calculation. The values for the ESP maximum
and minimum energies were normalized across all samples to better
compare polarities and electrostatic characters.
