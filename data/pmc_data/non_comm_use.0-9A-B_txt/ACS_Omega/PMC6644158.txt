Per-
and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are man-made chemicals
that are toxic and widely detected in the environment, including drinking
water sources. A cost-effective treatment process for PFASs is currently
not available. We developed reusable hydrogel sorbents to remove long-
and short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propanoic
acid (GenX), which is are emerging PFAS. Through fluoridation and
amination of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), the newly synthesized
sorbents can sorb the five targeted PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorobutanesulfonic
acid (PFBS), and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and GenX) to different
degrees from aqueous solution. Aminated PEGDA showed the highest sorption
capacity for all five PFASs, particularly for PFBA and PFBS. The bifunctionalized
PEGDA showed higher capacities for PFOA and PFOS, suggesting that
both hydrophobic interactions and charges contribute to the sorption.
Both aminated and bifunctionalized sorbents can remove GenX from water,
with the highest sorption capacity of 98.7 μmol g aminated PEGDA–1 within 6 h. The absorbed PFASs on the sorbents were
observed and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.
The spent sorbents were reusable after readily regenerated with 70%
methanol contained 1% NaCl.

Introduction
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFASs) are groups of synthetic
compounds with low surface tension and unique hydrophobic and hydrophilic
characteristics. PFASs are broadly used in various industries, including
paintings, clothing, electrical conductors, and polytetrafluoroethylene
coatings for many decades.1 Exposure to
PFASs has been demonstrated to cause developmental effects, liver
and kidney toxicity, immune effects, and cancer in animal studies.
Long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, like perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)
and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), are of particularly concern.2,3 The United States Environmental Protection Agency has set health
advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water at 70 ng L–1 of individual or combined concentrations.2,4,5 Due to the phase out of the long-chain
PFASs (≥C8) in 2015, short-chain PFASs such as C6 polyfluoroalkyl substances and a new PFAS such as 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propanoic
acid (GenX) have been widely manufactured and used by industries in
recent years. The shift of using different PFASs has resulted in increasing
occurrences of a wide range of PFASs, particularly short-chain PFASs
like perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid
(PFBS), and GenX in the environment.6−8 The State of Minnesota
has issued health-based guidelines for drinking water for PFBA (C4) and PFBS (C4) of 7 and 2 μg L–1, respectively.9 GenX can
induce necrosis of liver cells in male mice after 28 days of
oral exposure to GenX, suggesting that GenX is more toxic
to liver than PFOA10,11 As such, a drinking water provisional goal
for GenX at a concentration lower than 140 ng L–1 has been issued by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Services in the state of North Caorlina.12 Thus, an effective treatment process to remove both legacy and emerging
PFASs is warranted.

Sorption processes have shown better PFAS
removals from water than
other treatment processes such as coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation,
filtration, and advanced oxidation13,14 Activated
carbons and ion-exchange resins are two commonly used sorbents for
removing long-chain PFAS from water.15−20 Granular activated carbon (GAC) can achieve a sorption capacity
of 1.1 mg g GAC–1 for PFOA.21 However, GAC or ion-exchange resin is not as effective for short-chain
PFASs and GenX removal.22,23 High costs are common
associated with the applications of these sorbents. For example, ion-exchange
resins are expensive to operate despite that they are reusable.24 As regeneration of the spent GAC is inefficient
and energy intensive, a large quantity of the spent GAC generated
from PFAS treatment is commonly disposed, which resulted in high disposal
cost.25

Recently, new sorbents like
quaternized cotton and polyaniline
nanofibers have shown high sorption capabilities for PFOA and PFOS.26 Studies have suggested that the amino groups
of the sorbents contributed the positive charge, enabling rapid sorption
of PFASs anions through electrostatic attraction in 4 to 48 h.26,27 However, reuse of the sorbents was not addressed and appears impractical
since regeneration via solvent extraction and thermal desorption can
damage the sorbent structure, decrease the surface area of fibrous
sorbents, and thus compromise their sorption capacity. An alternative
approach for enhancing PFAS removal from aqueous solution is to increase
hydrophobic interactions between the sorbents and PFAAs. Koda et al.
designed fluorous microgel star polymers to capture PFOA/PFOS using
hydrophobic interaction.28 The backbone
structure of star polymer composes by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-performed
hydrophilic, which can attract PFOA/PFOS onto this star polymer, whereas
the core of star polymer was constructed by fluoride, which contributed
hydrophobic interaction to confine PFOA/PFOS at the central and the
captured PFOA/PFOS could be released by treating organic solvent or
salt.28 Fluorous microgel star polymer
can not be reused because the structure of micelle would be easily
destroyed by environmental disturbance. Additionally, star polymer
exists as unstable liquid phase that makes it difficult for large-scale
applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new sorbents
with short equilibrium time, high sorption capacity, easy regeneration,
and reusability for PFAS removal.

Hydrogel-based sorbents are
highly hydrophilic, and thus allow
pollutants in water to diffuse easily into the hydrogels.
Among many materials used for manufacturing hydrogen-based sorbents,
poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is an ideal substrate because
of its hydrophilicity of PEG backbone and its  diacrylate groups
that allow adjustable functionalization. Accordingly, we
hypothesize that PEGDA-based hydrogel sorbents can be functionalized
using 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl methacrylate (13FOMA) and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium
chloride solution (MTAC) to create hydrophobic regions and/or electrostatic
attractive interaction. In this study, the functionalization of PEGDA
is achieved by amination, fluoridation, and bifunctionalization (Figure 1). The amination
of PEGDA contributes electrostatic force, whereas the fluoridation
of PEGDA presents the hydrophobic interaction. The bifunctionalization
of PEGDA integrates amination and fluoridation, which contributes
electrostatic force and hydrophobic interaction simultaneously. This
work is aimed at evaluating their performance for removing long-chain
(PFOA and PFOS), short-chain fluorinated substances (PFBA and PFBS),
and perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acid group (GenX) from the water.
Moreover, the regeneration of the functionalized PEGDA was investigated
in this study.

via fluoridation and amination using 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl
methacrylate and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride,
respectively. Sorbent C was fabricated via bifunctionalization by
integrating fluoridation and amination.

Results and Discussion
Characteristics of Sorbents A–C
Three newly
synthesized sorbents A–C were characterized using Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) analysis (Figure 2). Details of characterized peaks in the FTIR spectra
of PEGDA and sorbents A–C are available in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Figure 2a shows the FTIR spectra 2a of PEGDA. The
peaks between 2981 and 2881 cm–1 were contributed
by ν(C–H) from PEGDA, whereas the peaks between 1450
and 1407 cm–1 were corresponding with the bending
of C–H from PEGDA.27 In addition,
the peaks between 1348 and 1093 cm–1 present the
ν(C–O) and ν(C–O–C) from PEGDA, respectively.29 Compared to the FTIR spectra of sorbent A (Figure 2b), the peaks between
1243, 1189, and 1141 cm–1 correspond to ν(CF2), whereas the rocking and wagging vibrations of C–F
were shown at the range from 746 to 650 cm–1.26,30 These peaks indicated that sorbent A has been successfully functionalized
via fluorination.

functionalized
PEGDA: (a) PEGDA (b) sorbent A, (c) sorbent B, and (d) sorbent C.
The characterized peaks of PEGDA, 13FOMA, and MTAC are marked in FTIR
spectra. The dash line indicated the peak, ν(C–F)13FOMA, ν(C–N)MTAC, and ν(C–O–C)PEGDA.

FTIR spectra of sorbent
B (aminated PEGDA) are shown in Figure 2c. Compared to those
of PEGDA (Figure 2a),
the new peaks located at 1247 cm–1 was assumed as
ν(C–N).31 Moreover, the peaks
shown in peak deconvolution, 1141 and 1485 cm–1 (Figure S2a), could be assigned as ν(C–N)
and ν(−N+–(CH3)3), respectively.27,32 The FTIR spectra of sorbent C,
which is bifunctionalized, are shown in Figure 2d. The characterized peaks for C–F
and C–N were recognized in the FTIR spectra, and the locations
of these peaks were similar to those presence in the FTIR spectra
of sorbent A and sorbent B. These results indicated that PEGDA has
been successfully functionalized with 13FOMA, MTAC, and both via photocrosslinking.

ζ-Potentials of PEGDA and sorbents play a crucial role in
determining the sorption capability toward PFASs. Table 1 shows the ζ-potential
of PEGDA and sorbents, ranging from negative to positive. Sorbent
A has a negative ζ-potential of −27.1 ± 0.4 mV,
which is contributed not only from the backbone of PEGDA (−25.4
± 1.6 mV) but also from the fluorine of 13FOMA.33 The ζ-potential of sorbent B is positive (39.0 ±
1.6 mV) contributed from the ammonium of MTAC. The ζ-potential
of sorbent C is also positive (31.4 ± 0.6 mV) due to the combination
of the negative charge of 13FOMA and the positive charge of MTAC.
Accordingly, the ζ-potential of sorbent C is less positive than
that of the sorbent B.

Sorption of PFASs by Sorbents A–C
The three
sorbents showed different sorption abilities, with respect to PFAS
removal (%) and sorption capacity (mass of PFAS/mass of sorbent),
toward these model PFASs (Figure 3a,b and Table S1 in Supporting
Information). PFAS removal ratio, calculated based on the changes
of PFAS concentration in liquid before and after incubation with sorbents
divided by initial PFAS concentration in the solution, is shown in Figure 3a. PFAS sorption
capacity, defined as the amount of PFAS sorbed per the amount of sorbent,
is calculated and summarized in Table S1 and shown in Figure 3b. PEGDA showed no sorption capacity toward PFOA and PFOS (Table S1).

Figure 3 Sorption % and capability of sorbents
B and C for long- (C8: PFASs having eight carbons) and
short-chain PFASs (C4: PFASs
having four carbons) and GenX (an emerging PFAS). (a) The sorption
% of PFOA, PFBA, PFOS, PFBS, and GenX after 6 h of incubation at room
temperature. (b) Sorption capacities of sorbent B and sorbent C for
these five PFASs. The average initial PFASs concentrations determined
by LC/MS/MS): PFOA = 103.6 mg L–1, PFOS = 33.3
mg L–1, PFBA = 106.3 mg L–1, PFBS
= 111.5 mg L–1, and GenX = 63.8 mg L–1.

Although sorbent A can sorb low
levels of PFOA, PFOS, and PFBA
in 6 h (less than 10%), sorbent A was unable to sorb PFBS and GenX
(Table S1). Sorbents B and C showed improved
sorption abilities toward all five PFASs tested in this study (Figure 3), compared to sorbent
A. Within 6 h, sorbent B was able to completely (100%) sorb PFOA
and PFBS, and 91 and 78% for PFOS and PFBA, respectively (Figure 3a). Sorbent C also
showed excellent removal toward PFOA and PFBS. However, sorbent C
showed a less removal for PFBA (62%) than those observed for sorbent
B. Both sorbents B and C showed greater than 95% of removal toward
GenX.

The sorption capacities of sorbent B and sorbent C for
PFOA were
estimated to be greater than 109.8 and 110.0 μmol g sorbents–1, respectively. The PFOA sorption capacities by sorbents
B and C are approximately 5 times higher than that by sorbent A (20.0
μmol g sorbents–1). Compared to sorbent C,
sorbent B showed a slightly higher sorption capability short-chain
PFAAs, PFBA, and PFBS. However, higher GenX sorption capacities of
sorbent C than those of sorbent B suggested that hydrophobic force
play an important role in the sorption of long-chain PFASs. The sorption
capacities for GenX by sorbent B and sorbent C are 86.7 ± 5.1
and 98.7 ± 3.9 μmol g sorbent–1, respectively

The differences in sorption ability of these three sorbents toward
the five PFASs can be explained by the chemical properties of these
PFASs and the ζ-potentials of these sorbents. PFAAs, consisting
of fluoroalkane and carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, are commonly
present with negative charge, and the hydrophobicity of PFAAs decrease
as the chain length decreases.34 For GenX,
consisting of short chain of fluoroalkyl ether and carboxylic acid,
also usually provide negative charge and hydrophobicity.35 Thus, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic
force are considered as two most effective strategies to sorb and
retain these PFASs from aqueous solution.

The different
ζ-potentials of sorbents might explain
their different sorption capabilities toward PFASs observed in this
study. The poor sorption capability toward these PFASs by sorbent
A might be due to its negative ζ-potential (Table 1), despite that the fluorine
in sorbent A contributes hydrophobic force to interact with PFASs.
The negative charge on the surface of the sorbent A might create an
electrostatically repulsive force between PFASs and sorbent A, resulting
in poor sorption of these PFASs. The charge repulsive force can also
be explained why the unmodified PEGDA (which has a negative ζ-potential)
failed to sorb tested PFASs.

Unlike sorbent A and unmodified
PEGDA, the ζ-potentials of
sorbent B and sorbent C are positive, which can spontaneously generate
electrostatically attractive force between the negatively charged
PFASs and the positively charged sorbents. As a result, the sorbents
can remove all PFASs from water under the tested conditions (over
6 h of incubation) and were particularly effective for PFOA and PFBS
removal. These results strongly suggested that electrostatically attractive
force is the dominant interaction for capturing PFASs by sorbents
B and C.

Sorbent B has higher surface charge (39.0 ± 1.6
mV) than sorbent
C (31.4 ± 0.6 mV), resulting in absorbing higher concentrations
of PFBA and PFBS. Sorbent C provided additionally hydrophobic interaction
to compensate the lower surface charge, leading to the similar sorption
capacity for PFOS. Overall, sorbent C showed preference for long
chain PFASs, whereas sorbent B preferred to capture negatively charged
and/or short chain PFASs. As the structure of GenX (shown in Figure S1) is similar to PFOA, it was not surprising
to observe comparable PFAS removal and sorption capacity of GenX by
the sorbent B and sorbent C.

Characterization of Spent
Sorbents
The FTIR spectra
of the spent sorbents were compared to those of the freshly
synthesized sorbents (Figures 4–6 for spent sorbents A–C,
respectively). The peak deconvolutions for sorbents before and after
absorbing PFASs are shown in Figures S2–S5 and Tables S3–S16 (Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of sorbent A before and
after sorption of PFASs; (a) before sorption, (b) PFOA sorption, (c)
PFOS sorption, (d) PFBA sorption, (e) PFBS sorption.

As sorbent A showed poor sorption ability toward
PFASs, only subtle
changes in the FTIR spectra of the spent sorbent A are observed
(Figure 4). For example,
a broad peak in the range from 3600 to 3000 cm–1 is noted in spectra 4b (Figure 4b), indicating the ν(O–H) of PFOA. The
peak at the range of 1300–1000 cm–1 could
be deconvoluted as 1241, 1189, and 1143 cm–1 contributed
from 13FOMA, whereas the peak of νs(CF2) at 1189 cm–1 became a broader peak in the range
from 1205 to 1170 cm–1 resulting in the sorption
of PFOA. However, as the amount of PFOA sorbed on the sorbent A was
too low, the peak representing the carbonyl group, which is shown
at the range from 1700 to 1630 cm–1, was not substantial
in the FTIR spectra 4b. Similar FTIR spectra are observation for PFOS
spent sorbent A (Figure 4c). In the Figure S2b, the shoulder peak
at 1265 cm–1 could be assigned as νs(CF2) contributed from PFOS after capturing on sorbent
A.32 Due to the poor sorption of PFBA and
PFBS by sorbent A, the peak for carbonyl group is not clear and not
distinguishable in the FTIR spectra 4d and 4e (Figure 4d,e). However, additional peaks were deconvoluted
in the range from 1300 to 1000 cm–1 shown in Figure S2c,d, Tables S5 and S6. The peaks at
1201, 1176, and 1132 cm–1 are responding to νs(CF2) of PFBA, whereas the peaks at 1280, 1205,
1172, 1130, and 1103 cm–1 are related with νs(CF2) of PFBS.

Sorbent B was able to capture
PFOA effectively (Figure 3) and was evident by the stronger
intensity of the peaks at 1681 and 1240 cm–1 in
FTIR spectra 5a and 5b (Figure 5). These two peaks corresponded to νas(COO–) and νs(CF2)26,30 indicating the occurrence of PFOA sorption on the sorbent. The intensity
of C–F peaks in the range from 750 to 530 cm–1 also increases due to the absorbed PFOA. In the peak deconvolution
(Figure S3a and Table S7), a new peak appeared
at 1203 cm–1 and the intensity of the peak at 1240
cm–1 increased, providing additional evidence of
occurrence of PFOA sorption by sorbent B. Moreover, the peak at 1141
cm–1 was partially shifted to 1174 cm–1 due to the sorption of PFOA by the quaternary ammonium groups on
sorbent B. Compared to the sorption of PFOS by sorbent B, the new
peak located at 1189 cm–1 was assumed as νs(CF2) contributed from PFOS (Figure S3b and Table S8). The broader peak shown at 1251 cm–1 was also due to sorption of PFOS. The FTIR spectra
5d and 5e were observed from the sorbent B after sorption of PFBA
and PFBS (Figure 5d,e).
Sorption of PFBA on the sorbent B was evident by the presence of peaks
at 1689 and 1222 cm–1 in FTIR spectra, corresponding
to νas(COO–) and νs(CF2) of PFBA. In the deconvoluted spectra, the peaks
at 1106, 1203, and 1222 cm–1 are corresponding to
νs(CF2) of PFBA (Figure S3c and Table S9). Sorbed PFBS on the sorbent B could be observed
in the deconvoluted spectra (Figure S3d and Table S10). The new peaks at 1286 and 1211 cm–1 are corresponding to νs(SO) and νs(CF2) of PFBS and the peak at 1141 cm–1 was partially shifted to 1173 cm–1, which is similar
as the sorption of PFOA of sorbent B. In addition, the peak for quaternary
ammonium captures PFBS shifted from 1240 to 1255 cm–1. It demonstrated that quaternary ammonium of sorbent B captures
PFASs through electrostatic attractive force.

(FTIR) spectra of sorbent B before and
after sorption of PFASs: (a) before sorption, (b) PFOA sorption, (c)
PFOS sorption, (d) PFBA sorption, (e) PFBS sorption, (f) GenX sorption.

Sorbent C, fluoridation, and amination
of PEGDA can provide hydrophobic
and electrostatic force simultaneously. Figures 6a–6c and S4a–c present
the FTIR of sorbent C before and after sorption. The new peak of PFOA
at 1234 cm–1 in the presence of sorbent C indicated
νs(CF2). The peak at of νs(CF2) was slightly shifted to higher wavenumber, from
1190 to 1199 cm–1, which demonstrated the interaction
of C–F between sorbent and PFOA. In addition, the peaks at
1259 and 1239 cm–1 were integrated as 1240 cm–1 and the intensity of peak at 1240 cm–1 was stronger, which is corresponding with the sorption of PFOA.
The detail information of deconvoluted peak at the range 1300–1000
cm–1 is listed in Table S11. Other peaks showing stronger intensity were detected at the range
from 750 to 520 cm–1 because of wagging and rocking
vibration of absorbed PFOA. The peaks of νs(CN) at
1144 cm–1 were shifted to 1166 cm–1 and the peaks of νas(COO–) at
1459 cm–1 were shifted to 1477 cm–1, demonstrating the interaction between COO groups and CN groups.
Compared to the sorption of PFOS in sorbent C, the peak intensity
of C–F also increases in the same range as absorbed PFOA. The
new peaks at 1068 and 1241 cm–1 were corresponding
to the νas(SO3–) from
PFOS. Peak deconvolution (Figure 6d) indicated that the intensity of peaks at 1267 and
1240 cm–1 increased after absorbing PFOS. In addition,
the new peak at 1122 cm–1 was also assigned as the
νs(CF2) from PFOS. The peak of νas(SO3–) in the presence of sorbent
C was slightly shifted to lower wavenumber, from 1201 to 1193 cm–1, whereas the νs(SO3–) was also shifted to lower wavenumber, from 1074 to
1058 cm–1 (Figure S4b and Table S12). From these shifts, it can be assumed that the C–N+ in the presence of sorbent C can also capture PFOS using
electrostatic force. Considering the sorptions of PFBA and PFBS using
sorbent C, we also can see the similar spectra, Figure 6d,6e, as PFOA and
PFOS. The carbonyl groups and C–F are obviously shown at 1683
and 1226 cm–1, respectively. In the peak deconvolution,
the additional peak is shown at 1226 and 1110 cm–1 for absorbed PFBA (Figure S4c and Table S13). The peaks of quaternary ammonium of MTAC and the fluoride of 13FOMA
shifted from 1144 to 1182 and 1190 to 1203 cm–1,
respectively. In addition, absorbed PFBS on sorbent also can be observed
on FTIR spectra. The additional peak is shown at 1051 and 1128 cm–1, which is corresponding to νas(SO3–) and C–F of PFBS. The peak of quaternary
ammonium of MTAC and the fluorine of 13FOMA shifted from 1141 to 1189,
1190 to 1211, and 1259 to 1280 cm–1 (Figure S4d and Table S14).

(FTIR) spectra of sorbent C before and
after sorption of PFASs: (a) before sorption, (b) PFOA sorption, (c)
PFOS sorption, (d) PFBA sorption, (e) PFBS sorption, (f) GenX sorption.

Sorbed GenX on sorbent B and sorbent
C was observed on the FTIR
spectra. As shown in Figure 5f, the additional peak was observed at 1635 cm–1 and at the range from 1570 to 1683 cm–1. In the
peak deconvolution (Figure S5a,b, Tables S15 and S16), the additional peak of absorbed GenX on sorbent B is
shown at 1101 and 1228 cm–1 for νs(CF2). The peak at 1259 cm–1 indicates
the interaction between quaternary ammonium and carboxylic acid. Additionally,
new peak of absorbed GenX on sorbent C illustrates νs(CF2) at 1128 cm–1, and the peak at
1166 cm–1 demonstrates the interaction between quaternary
ammonium and carboxylic acid.

Desorption of PFASs from
Spent Sorbents
The ability
to desorb PFASs from the spent sorbents is a favorable feature, since
the spent sorbent can be regenerated for reuse and thus reduce the
overall treatment costs for PFASs. In this study, different desorption
solutions were tested for regeneration of the spent sorbents. All
desorption percentages, calculated as the amount of PFASs released
into the extraction solution over the amount of PFASs in the spent
sorbent, are shown in Table S17 in Supporting
Information.

PFOA absorbed on sorbent A cannot be extracted
well and released only 5% using 100% methanol or 100% acetonitrile
as extraction solution. In contrast, PFOS absorbed on sorbent A can
be extracted and released over 100% by treating with 100% methanol.
Also, 70% methanol with 1% NaCl was effective for extracting PFOA
and PFBA from the spent sorbent A over 121 and 72%, respectively.
More than 90% of PFASs on the spent sorbent B and sorbent C can be
extracted with 70% methanol containing 1% NaCl. The good extraction
efficacy using this extraction solution might be due to the alteration
of the ionic strength that led to breakage of the electrostatic interaction
between PFASs and the sorbents. Using the same extraction solution,
approximately 84 and 70% GenX were released from sorbent B and sorbent
C, respectively.

The regenerated sorbents were further characterized
based on FTIR
analysis (Figures S6 and S7). The FTIR
spectra of the regenerated sorbent A to that of the newly synthesized
sorbent A were similar (Figure S6). On
the other hand, the desorption of PFASs from sorbent B and sorbent
C could be recognized in FTIR spectra (Figure S7a,b). Specifically, the intensity of carboxyl group (1681
cm–1) decreases and even disappears, suggesting
that part of absorbed PFOA and PFBA was extracted and released by
methanol and NaCl. Similarly, the release of absorbed PFOS and
PFBS was observed in the peak deconvolution. The intensity of νs(CF2) of PFOS and PFBS also decreases and even
reaches to zero after desorption. As only 70–84% of sorbed
GenX was desorbed from the spent sorbent B and sorbent C, the characteristic
peak of GenX was obviously observed in the FTIR spectra of the regenerated
sorbents B and C. Overall, the results of FITR analysis of the regenerated
sorbents were consistent to the results of desorption of PFASs from
the spent sorbents, suggesting that spent sorbents B and C can be
regenerated for reuse.

with high sorption capacity for long- and short-chain PFAAs and GenX.
The new hydrogel-based sorbents were synthesized by functionalizing
PEGDA to create both electrostatic attractive force (MTAC) and hydrophobic
interaction (13FOMA) for PFAS sorption. Moreover, hydrogel provides
higher water content and porous three-dimensional structure network
so that the diffusion resistance could be reduced. As a result, the
sorption and diffusion model would be different from those used for
activated carbons.

Introducing fluorographene into sorbents
to create strong hydrophobic regions in the sorbent has enabled high
PFOA and PFOS removal (92–97%) at a short equilibrium time
of 2 min.36 In our study, 13FORMA was introduced
into sorbents A and C to create hydrophobic regions in the sorbents.
Thus, a rapid removal of PFASs at a short equilibrium time is expected.
Future studies using these newly developed sorbents to evaluate the
sorption kinetics for PFASs under environmental relevant conditions
such as PFAS-contaminated groundwater or surface water are thus needed.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report describing hydrogel-based
sorbents to effectively remove short chain of PFASs. Most commercial
resins, like Purolite A600E and Purolite A520E, have better sorption
capacities for PFOA and PFOS, compared to those by the sorbents developed
in this study. However, these two resins have much lower sorption
capacities for PFBA and PFBS than those of our sorbents. For resin
A600E, the sorption capacities for PFBA and PFBS were 10 and 3 μmol
g sorbent–1, respectively. For resin A520E, the
sorption capacities for PFBA and PFBS were 20 and 8 μmol g sorbent–1, respectively. Our sorbents showed 8 to 63 folds
higher sorption capacities than these commercial resin for shorter-chain
PFASs.37 Accordingly, these hydrogel-based
sorbents have a potential to remove these concerned shorter-chain
PFASs from water. Increasing environmental occurrences of GenX and
short-chain PFAS have been reported in America,38 Europe,7 and China.39,40 Similar to long-chain PFASs, GenX and short-chain PFASs have been
detected in food and fish and suggested that they are bioaccumulative.7,41 The sorbents developed in this study showed potential to sorb the
five model PFASs. Future studies are needed to examine the effectiveness
of these sorbents for treating water contaminated with various types
and concentrations of PFASs.

Electrostatically attractive force
appeared to be the dominant
interaction for sorbing PFASs on to the functionalized PEGDA sorbents.
This finding implicates that one can improve the sorption capacity
for PFAS, particularly soluble anionic PFASs, by increasing the ζ-potential
of functionalized PEGDA sorbents. The ζ-potential of unmodified
PEGDA is negative, whereas MTAC-modified PEGDA shifts the ζ-potential
from negative to positive. Therefore, manufacturing higher ζ-potential
of functionalized PEGDA can be achieved by changing the concentration
of precursors, MTAC, during synthesis. At low pH, higher sorption
capabilities of PFOA and PFOS have been observed.26 On the other hand, presence of ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ have shown to interfere the absorption of PFASs.42 Thus, future study is needed to investigate
the effects of pH and these ions on the sorption capability of PFAS
by these newly developed sorbents. The MTAC-modified PEGDA can be
also extended to remove metallic anion, like chromium ion from water.
Furthermore, PEGDA can be functionalized to be more negatively charge
by using sulfonic or carboxyl groups to capture or chelate cationic
PFASs. Hydrophobic interaction is another mechanism for sorbing PFASs.
In this study, however, less sorption capacities of PFASs were observed
for polymer A than those for polymers B and C. It is possible that
more 13FOMA is needed to bond with PEGDA to generate a stronger hydrophobic
interaction in the sorbent for PFAS removal. This aspect should be
further investigated in the future by using a higher amount of 13FOMA
to functionalize the PEGDA sorbent, followed by confirming the degree
of fluorination using the NMR spectroscopy analysis.

Thermal
regeneration is commonly used for regeneration of spent
activated carbons and ceramic oxides. However, this method is costly
and unable to regenerate the sorbents to its original sorption capacity.
The extraction solution (methanol with NaCl) to regenerate the functionalized
PEGDA will be less expensive than thermal regeneration. Nevertheless,
future studies are needed to determine the reuse cycles of the regenerated
sorbents. It is also expected that the functionalized PEGDA sorbents
can be further developed for continuous treatment of PFAS-contaminated
water using packed and/or fluidized bed reactors.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA,
average molecular weight of the polymer = 575), 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone
(C6H5COC(OCH3)2C6H5, >99%), 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone (C6H9NO, >99%), [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium
chloride
solution (MTAC, 75% in water), 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl methacrylate
(13FOMA, >97%), and PFBA were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis,
MO). PFOA was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). PFOS and
PFBS were purchased from TCI America (Portland, OR). 2,3,3,3-Tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propanoic
acid (GenX) was purchased from SynQuest laboratories (Alachua, FL).

Synthesis of Sorbents: Fluoridation, Amination, and Bifunctionalization
of PEGDA
Three different hydrogel sorbents were synthesized
by fluoridation, amination, and bifunctionalization of PEGDA (Figure 1). The fluoridated,
aminated, and bifunctionalized PEGDA are hereafter referred as sorbent
A, B, and C, respectively. The ratio of PEGDA to the modification
reagent, such as 13FOMA or MTAC, is 1 as one acrylate group of PEGDA
is to conjugate with the modification reagent and the another acrylate
group is for cross-linking. The precursor solution for fluoridatation
of PEGDA was prepared by adding 266 μL of PEGDA and 173 μL
of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl methacrylate (13FOMA) into 200 μL
of isopropanol, resulting in final moles of 0.52 mmol PEGDA and 0.52
mmol of 13FOMA. The precursor solution for aminated PEGDA was prepared
by adding 266 μL of PEGDA and 130 μL of [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium
chloride (MTAC) into 200 μL of deionized (DI) water, resulting
in final moles of 0.52 mmol PEGDA and 0.26 mmol of MTAC. The precursor
solution for bifunctionalization of PEGDA was prepared by adding 532
μL of PEGDA, 346 μL of 13FOMA, and 260 μL of MTAC
into 400 μL of isopropanol, resulting in final moles of 1.04
mmol PEGDA, 1.04 mmol of 13FOMA, and 1.04 mmol of MTAC. Each of the
precursor solution was then mixed with 3% 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone.
The mixture was filled into a PDMS mold for sorbent synthesis through
soft lithography as described previously43 with some modifications. Briefly, the precursor solutions were poured
into the wells of PDMS mold and allowed for solidification under 365
nm UV light (80 W) for 5 min. After solidification, these functionalized
PEGDA were released from PDMS mold and were washed by DI water three
times. These sorbents were stored in oven at 60 °C for experimental
use. All sorbents were synthesized in duplicate, and the size of the
sorbents was 1 mm × 1 mm × 0.3 mm.

PFASs Sorption and Desorption
Tests
The sorbents were
used for PFASs sorption/desorption experiments. Five model of PFASs:
PFOA, PFBA, PFOS, PFBS, and GenX were used. PFOA and PFOS were chosen
to represent long-chain PFASs, whereas PFBA and PFBS were chosen to
represent short-chain PFASs. GenX was chosen to represent perfluoroether
carboxylic acids (PFECAs). The experiments were carried out in 20
mL glass vials containing 5 mL of each of target PFASs in DI water
with 10 mg of each of sorbents (sorbent A or sorbent B or sorbent
C). The vials were capped with polypropylene caps. To determine the
sorption capacity of each PFASs by the sorbents, high initial concentrations
of PFASs (∼100 mg L–1, except PFOS) were
used. The vials were incubated at room temperature with shaking at
150 rpm for 12 h. During the sorption experiments, liquid samples
were collected at 6 and 12 h. Collected liquid samples were analyzed
for PFASs.

Following the sorption experiment (i.e., after 12
h of incubation), desorption experiments were conducted in 20 mL glass
vials using a range of different extraction solution, including 100%
methanol, 100% acetonitrile, or 70% methanol with 1% NaCl. Briefly,
the spent sorbents in the vials were washed with DI water twice before
adding 5 mL of extraction solution. The mixture was incubated at room
temperature with shaking at 150 rpm for 12 h. The spent sorbents after
desorption were washed with DI water two times. Duplicate samples
were used in each set of sorption/desorption experiments.

PFAS Analysis
The concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFBA,
and PFBS in liquid samples were determined using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC, UltiMate 3000, Thermo Scientific)/triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) (QqQ-MS, Quantiva, Thermo
Scientific), as described previously.44 Briefly, 10 μL of samples was injected and then separated
by a Hypersil Gold 5 μm 50 × 3 mm column (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA) maintained at 30 °C using the solvent gradient method.
The flow rate was 0.5 μL min–1. Chromatographic
separation was achieved on a solvent A, water (0.1% formic acid) and
solvent B, acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid). The separation gradient
method used was of 0–4 min (20% B to 80% B), 4–4.1 min
(80% B to 95% B), 4.1–6 min (95% B), 6–6.5 min (95%
B to 20% B), and 6.5–8 min (20% B). MS parameters were optimized
for each of these PFAAs under direct infusion at 5 μL min–1 to identify the selected reaction monitoring (SRM)
transitions (precursor/product fragment ion pair). Sample acquisition
and analysis were performed with TraceFinder 3.3 (Thermo Scientific).

The concentrations of GenX in liquid samples were analyzed by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1290 Infinity II)/triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer (QqQ-MS, Agilent 6470) equipped with a Jet Stream
electrospray ionization source. Samples (10 μL) were injected
and then separated by an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C-18 narrow bore
(2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 μm) HPLC column maintained at 40
°C. The flow rate was 0.5 mL min–1. Chromatographic
separation was achieved on solvent A (5 mM ammonium acetate in water)
and solvent B (95% MeOH and 5% water with 5 mM ammonium acetate).
The separation gradient method used was of 0–0.5 min (holding
at 5% B), 0.6–3 min (5% B to 95% B), 3.1–4 min (holding
at 95% B), 4.1–5 min (95% B to 5% B) and stabilize column at
5% B for 5 min. MS parameters were optimized for GenX under direct
infusion at 0.4 mL min–1 to identify the MRM (multiple
SRM) transitions (precursor/product fragment ion pair). 13C isotopically labeled GenX was used as an internal standard. Sample
acquisition and analysis were performed with MassHunter B.08.02 (Agilent).

Characterization of Sorbents
Fourier-transform infrared
(FTIR) analysis was used to characterize the sorbents before and after
PFAS sorption. All of the sorbents were dried in a vacuum dryer at
25 °C for hours before the FTIR analysis using a Thermo Nicolet
380 FTIR spectrometer in the Materials Characterization Facility at
Texas A&M University. The wavenumber ranges from 400 to 4000 cm–1 was used, and the absorbance was recorded with 0.9
cm–1 resolution. The peak deconvolution was analyzed
using software Origin in the range from 1000 to 1300 cm–1. The ζ-potentials of the newly synthesized sorbents and the
pure PEGDA were measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern, U.K.)
in the Biomedical Engineering Facility at Texas A&M University.
