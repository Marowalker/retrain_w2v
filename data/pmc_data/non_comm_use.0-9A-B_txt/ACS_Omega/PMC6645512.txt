The catalytic performance of metal
particles is closely related
to the particle size. In this article, ultrafine palladium nanoparticles
anchored on nitrogen-doping carbon support (Pd/N-XC72R) were fabricated,
wherein the N-XC72R was prepared through low-temperature annealing
of Vulcan XC72R carbon with urea at 300 °C. Nitrogen dopant on
the surface of carbon support can remarkably strengthen the affinity
of the metal nanoparticles onto the support. Compared with the Vulcan
XC-72R-supported Pd catalyst, the prepared Pd/N-XC72R delivered superior
catalytic activity for the transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes with
formic acid as the hydrogen donor at ambient temperature. Our strategy
may provide an effective and feasible approach to fabricate N-functionalized
carbon materials and construct high-performance ultrasmall metal nanoparticle
heterogeneous catalysts.

1 Introduction
Supported
metal catalysts have attracted considerable attention
in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.1 Recent research studies have demonstrated that the catalytic performance
of the metal nanoparticles go hand in hand with the size of the metal
particles.2 Usually, ultrafine metal nanoparticles
deliver better catalytic properties than bulk metals. Because of the
high ratio of surface to volume and large fraction of surface atoms,
ultrafine metal nanoparticles provide large amount of active center
available for catalysis and provide the surface atoms with high activity,
thus significantly improving the atom efficiency and reducing the
dosage of precious-metal catalysts.3−6 However, the high surface energy of metal
nanoparticles may cause serious aggregation of metal nanoparticles
because of Oswald ripening, which can result in the loss of their
catalytic performance and reusability.7 Therefore, it is still a challenging work to prepare the size-controlled
metal nanoparticles. To date, some synthetic routes have been developed
for the preparation of ultrafine metal nanoparticle catalysts, such
as utilizing the confinement effect of the supports, strengthening
the interactions between the metal nanoparticles and support, and
using excess capping agents. For example, a simple non-noble metal
sacrificial approach was developed to prepare highly dispersed AgPd
anchored on reduced graphene oxide, which exhibited superior catalytic
behavior for the dehydrogenation of formic acid (FA)8 and transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes.9 Hokenek et al. prepared monodispersed Pd particles using
a one-pot polyol method, which were supported onto silica and employed
for the catalytic decomposition of methanol.10 Xu and co-workers using a double-solvent way successfully anchored
both mono- and bimetallic nanoparticles in the pores of metal–organic
frameworks.11 Catalysts obtained by this
method delivered high-catalytic performance as well as excellent durability
for CO oxidation reaction. However, this method is only suitable for
porous supports with hydrophilic pores, which restrict its applications
widely.11 Kempe et al. reported a chemical
vapor deposition technique, in which Ni/Pd precursor was introduced
into the pores of the carrier by sublimation. The prepared catalyst
has a high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of dialkyl ketones.12 Despite recent progress, a facile and general
method for the preparation of ultrafine metal nanoparticle catalysts
is still highly desirable and a challenging task.

Nitrogen (N)-doped
carbon has emerged as a promising catalyst support
and found extensive applications in heterogeneous catalysis.13 The incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon
architecture can improve the wetting properties of the supports, which
is desirable for the metal deposition in solution, for example, by
impregnation.14,15 Moreover, nitrogen dopant can
act as coordination sites for anchoring of metal nanoparticles, which
can stabilize the small-size metal nanoparticles.16 Furthermore, the electronic structure of the nitrogen doping
carbon can be altered owing to the doped nitrogen and thus further
enhance their catalytic performance. Generally, nitrided carbons can
be prepared through arc-discharge/vaporization process, chemical vapor
deposition, and plasma treatment under NH3 atmosphere or
in the presence of other nitrogen sources.17 Recently, ultrasmall noble metal nanoclusters were prepared with
nitrogen-functionalized porous carbon as a support, which was obtained
by two-step low-temperature annealing with urea. The prepared catalysts
showed superior catalytic behavior and recyclability for the methanol
oxidation,18 dehydrogenation of FA,19 and selective oxidation of styrene.20 However, these strategies often suffer from
various problems, such as tedious, rigorous, and multistep preparative
processes, requiring high temperature or long pyrolysis time.

Of special note, aromatic amine derivatives are important chemical
intermediate for the preparation of azo dyes, pharmaceuticals, pigments,
and agrochemicals.21 The conventional route
for the production of aniline is the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds.22 Tradition catalysts, such as Raney Ni, mostly
use hydrogen as a hydrogen source. However, the application of this
technology has been limited because of the demand for specialized
equipment and safety issues related to H2 storage, transportation,
and handling. Using Fe and HCl as a reductant may generate large amounts
of waste acids and toxic residues, which lead to serious environmental
problems.23 Pd metals deliver high catalytic
activity for hydrogenation of nitroarenes.24 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of hydrogen donor nitro compounds
with hydrogen donor is an environmentally friendly and sustainable
way, which avoids the use of dangerous H2. Among the hydrogen
sources available for CTH, formic acid (FA), a major byproduct of
biomass processing, has been considered as a safe, abundant, sustainable,
and promising hydrogen source because of its nontoxicity, excellent
stability, and high energy density and can be regenerated by the hydrogenation
of CO2.15 During the past few
years, CTH with FA as a hydrogen donor has attracted considerable
interest.25

Here, a simple and effective
method was developed for preparing
nitrogen-functionalized carbon (N-XC72R) through one-step low-temperature
pyrolysis of commercial available Vulcan XC72R with urea at 300 °C.
The catalyst preparation process was illustrated in Scheme 1. Vulcan XC72R possesses large
specific surface area and high porosity, which make it an ideal candidate
for nitrogen doping. Well-dispersed and ultrafine Pd nanoparticles
were immobilized onto the N-XC72R support via a wet chemical reduction
method, which displayed superior catalytic activity and stability
for the CTH of nitrocompounds at room temperature with FA as the hydrogen
donor.

Scheme 1 Preparation Progress of Pd/N-XC72R
2 Results and Discussion
Nitrogen-doped
carbon was prepared by one-step low-temperature
pyrolysis of Vulcan XC72R carbon with urea at 300 °C. Nitrogen-containing
species can be incorporated into the carbon architecture via the reaction
with HCNO and NH3 produced from thermal decomposition of
urea,18 which can act as basic coordination
sites to strengthen the affinity of metal nanoparticles onto the carbon
support and stabilize the highly dispersed metal nanoparticles.

2.1 Characterization of Catalysts
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) were used to investigate
the structure and morphology of the prepared catalysts. Figure 1a,c reveals that well-dispersed
Pd nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed throughout the nitride
carbon support. In addition, the lattice spacing is measured to be
0.22 nm (Figure 1b),
which is attributed to the (111) plane of face-centered cubic (fcc)
Pd (0.224 nm).26 The mean size of Pd nanoparticles
in the Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 sample was about 2.5 nm (Figure 1d). In contrast, Pd particles
with a mean size of 5.3 nm are observed in the Pd/XC72R catalyst.
Moreover, the particle size of Pd in Pd/N-XC72R-2-300 and Pd/N-XC72R-6-200
was significantly smaller than that in Pd/XC72R (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the STEM
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping indicates the presence of nitrogen
and well-distributed Pd in the carrier (Figure 1e–h). The results revealed that the
nitrogen doping of the carbon support played a key role for the highly
dispersed Pd nanoparticles; the nitrogen-containing species can stabilize
the small-size metal nanoparticles.

catalyst and

To understand more about the structure and surface
properties of
Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 catalyst, we studied the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), and the spectra are described in Figure 2. The XPS survey spectrum of Pd/N-XC72R-6-300
catalyst indicated that the catalysts consist of mainly N, C, O, and
Pd. Binding energy (BE) calibration of the XPS spectra was carried
out with the help of the graphitic sp2 signal located at
285 eV. A stronger peak was located at 289 eV for Pd/N-XC72R-6-300,
corresponding to a higher proportion of sp3 carbon with
C–N and C–O bonds (Figure 2b).27 The N-XC72R-6-300
has a large nitrogen percentage of 12% and shows a three-state doublet
corresponding to XPS spectra. Three nitrogen species located at 398.7,
400.0, and 401.3 eV are detected in the Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 (Figure 2c). The maximum BE
of the n atom is 400.0 eV, which are assigned to
amine and amide groups, for example, C–NH and C–NH2. The peaks at 401.3 and 398.7 eV can be attributed to the
graphitic N and pyridine N atoms, respectively.18,28

data of Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 catalyst. Survey spectrum (a), high-resolution
spectrum of C 1s (b), N 1s (c), and Pd 3d (d).

Respectively, the Pd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks
with a BE of 336.6 and 341.9 eV are attributed to Pd0 (metallic
palladium), whereas the BE of 338.3 and 343.9 eV are related to Pd2+ (palladium oxide). The XPS data indicated that 70% Pd on
the surface of the catalyst existed as Pd0, which can be
attributed to the fact that the incorporation of amine groups in the
carrier can prevent the oxidation of Pd0 in air atmosphere.29−31 In addition, the higher BE of Pd0 in Pd/N-XC72R-6-300
sample at 336.6 and 341.9 eV than that in Pd/XC72R at 336.2 and 341.5
eV (Figure S2) indicates the negative-charged
Pd, which can be ascribed to the strong electronic coupling between
Pd and N-XC72R-6-300 support.32

Compared
with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) images of XC72R, N-XC72R-2-300,
N-XC72R-4-300, and N-XC72R-6-400, a new sharp peak located at 2θ
= 27.8° appeared for N-XC72R-6-200, N-XC72R-6-300, and N-XC72R-8-300
samples (Figures 3a
and S3), which is corresponded to the (002)
interlayer stacking of nitrided graphite (g-C3N4). For N-XC72R-6-400
sample, the peak at 2θ = 27.8° disappeared because the
graphite nitride can be decomposed with the calcination temperature
increasing to 400 °C.19,33 Fourier transform infrared
spectra revealed that there are two peaks at 3360 and 1509 cm–1 (Figure 3b), which can be attributed to the stretching and bending
of H–N, respectively. The strong peaks at 1731 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching of C=O, which is originated
from thermolysis products of urea, that is, HNCO.19,34

(top) and N-XC72R-6-300 (bottom), (c,d) XRD images and the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of XC72R, Pd/XC72R, N-XC72R-6-300,
and Pd/N-XC72R-6-300.

It is notable that no obvious diffraction peak for Pd can
be detected
at 2θ ≈ 40° for Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 sample, indicating
the well-dispersity of Pd nanoparticles in the catalyst. In contrast,
the XRD pattern of Pd/XC72R sample revealed distinct diffraction peaks
at 2θ = 40.1° because of the (111) reflection of Pd, which
confirms the formation of much larger Pd nanoparticles (Figure 3c). These observations are
consistent with the TEM results (Figures 1 and S1). The
surface areas and pore structures of the materials were measured by
N2 sorption measurements. Surface areas of Pd/N-XC72R-6-300,
N-XC72R-6-300, Pd/XC72R, and XC72R were 106, 61, 207, and 253 m2 g–1, respectively (Figure 3d). Compared with the XC72R, the appreciable
decrease of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area
of N-XC72R-6-300 indicates a large number of thermal decomposition
products of urea, such as ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid, successfully
dispersed inside the pores of XC72R. During the preparation of Pd/N-XC72R-6-300
catalyst, the N-XC72R-6-300 carrier was treated with sodium hydroxide
solution, some of the decomposition products of urea in the N-XC72R-6-300
will be dissolved, which results that the specific surface area of
Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 is higher than that of N-XC72R-6-300.

2.2 The CTH of nitroarenes
To investigate
the performance of the catalysts, the hydrogenation reaction of nitrobenzene
was carried out at 25 °C with ethanol–water (4:1: v/v)
as the solvent and FA and ammonium formate (AF) as the hydrogen source.
In the blank test, no conversion can be observed with N-XR72R and
XR72R as the catalyst (Table 1, entries 1–2), suggesting that Pd nanoparticles play
a decisive role in the hydrogenation reaction. For the Pd/XR72R catalyst,
the nitrobenzene conversion was only 21% after 3 h reaction under
the same reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 3). To our surprise, Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 with
2.5 nm size Pd revealed excellent catalytic performance for the transfer
hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, 99% of conversion and selectivity were
obtained after 10 min at room temperature (Table 1, entry 4). To clarify the effect of N, Pd/XR72R
sample with 2.6 nm size was prepared with sodium citrate as a stabilizing
agent according to a reported procedure.35 The catalytic activity of Pd/XR72R with 2.6 nm size was much higher
than that of Pd/XR72R with 5.3 nm size (Table 1, entries 3, 5); however, it is still lower
than that of Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 with 2.5 nm size. The results showed
that as the size of the metal nanoparticles decreases, the catalytic
activity increases significantly because smaller particles have more
active sites available for the reactants. Meanwhile, the interaction
of metal nanoparticle and the support also play an important role
for the catalytic performance. The calcination temperature and dosage
of urea may also affect the type and amount of nitrogen-containing
species in the support. When the calcination temperature was 200 and
400 °C, the catalytic activity of the corresponding catalysts,
Pd/N-XC72R-6-200 and Pd/N-XC72R-6-400, decreased significantly, the
reaction time required about 60 min to complete the reaction (Table 1, entries 4, 7). When
the mass ratio of urea and XC-72 carbon was 2:1, 4:1, 6:1, and 8:1,
the reaction can be completed after 30, 25, 10, and 12 min (Table 1, entries 6, 8–10),
respectively, which revealed that the mass ratio of 6:1 was enough
to achieve the high activity of the catalyst.

b 16 h.

The influence of hydrogen source and catalyst amount
on the CTH
catalyzed by Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 at 25 °C was also investigated
(Table S1, Supporting Information). Employed
FA or AF were used as the hydrogen source; the conversion of nitrobenzene
was 79 and 73% after 90 min, respectively (Table S1, entries 1–2). When FA/AF at 1:1 (molar ratio) was
used (Table S1, entry 3), 99% aniline was
yielded with excellent selectivity at 25 °C after 10 min reaction.
The TOF value was 1200 mol mol–1 Pd h–1 (Table 1, entry 6),
surpassing most of the heterogeneous catalysts that have been reported
in the literature for the CTH of nitrobenzene (Table S2). With further increase in the amount of FA or AF,
no obvious improvement can be observed (Table S1, entries 4–5). When using FA/HCOONa or FA/HCOOK as
the hydrogen source, longer reaction time was required (Table S1, entries 6–7). In addition, the
effect of the amount of catalyst was also discussed. When the amount
of catalyst was increased from 0.5 to 1 mol %, 99% conversion of nitrobenzene
was obtained after 4 min (Table S1, entry
8). Conversion (59%) of nitrobenzene was obtained after 90 min with
decreasing the amount of catalyst to 0.25 mol % (Table S1, entry 9).

The effect of reaction solvent was
investigated also (Table 1, entries 11–15).
When methanol and ethanol were used as the solvent, the desired product
was obtained after 45 min reaction (Table 1, entries 11–12). We were glad to
find that the reaction occurred efficiently in 10 min with 99% conversion
and selectivity using ethanol–water (4:1, v/v) as the solvent,
which was superior than that with water and methanol–water
(4:1, v/v) as the solvent (Table 1, entries 13–14).

The stability and recyclability
of the catalyst are important for
their practical application. The catalytic performance of Pd/N-XC72R-6-300
was well-retained after five consecutive runs, demonstrating the reusability
of the catalyst. In contrast, the catalytic performance of the recycled
Pd/XC72R decreased significantly (Figure S4). In addition, the TEM image of the used catalyst revealed that
the size and morphology of palladium nanoparticles did not change
significantly after five runs (Figure S5), verifying that the N-functionalized carbon prepared by the one-step
low-temperature pyrolysis can tremendously enhance the stability of
metal nanoparticles. In addition, the XRD test results indicated that
the XRD pattern of the fresh and the reused one has no significant
difference up to five runs (Figure S6).
Furthermore, a filtration test was also performed after 5 min of reaction,
the Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 catalyst was separated, and the solution continuously
reacted at room temperature for 16 min. The conversion did not increase
further even after 30 min of reaction under identical conditions (Figure S7), indicating that the metal was firmly
attached to the carrier and the Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 possessed a truly
heterogeneous nature. The above results suggested that the Pd/N-XC72R-6-300
was stable enough under the reaction conditions.

Under optimal
reaction conditions, a series of nitrosubstrates
was applied to expand the reaction over Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 catalyst.
Different nitro-compounds are converted to the anilines with high
yields under mild conditions. In addition, various electron donor
substituents attached to the aromatic ring, such as p-amino, o-methyl, p-methyl, p-hydroxyl, and o-hydroxyl, were able to
be reduced to corresponding amines with high yield (99%) after 15
min (Table 2, entries
2–6). The rate of reaction was affected slightly by the steric
hindrance (Table 2,
entries 3,6). What is more, p-nitrobenzene and p-nitroanisole can be completely reduced to the relevant
anilines by prolonging the reaction time to 60 and 30 min with high
yield (99%) (Table 2, entries 7, 8). However, the electron-withdrawing substituents of
ketone made the nitroarene reduction a little bit slow (Table 2 entries 9, 10). For the hydrogenation
of 1-nitronaphthalene and o-nitroacetophenone, the
yields of the product were only 63 and 66%, respectively, even after
180 min because of the space steric hindrance (Table 2, entries 11–12). When the temperature
rose to 50 °C, the hydrogenation reaction of o-nitroacetophenone and 1-nitronaphthalene can be completed with 99%
conversation and selectivity within 30 and 120 min, respectively (Table 2, entry 13, 14), which
indicated that obviously steric hindrance in the reactant can be tolerated
by the catalytic system.

2.3 Kinetic Study
Kinetic of the CTH
of nitrobenzene was studied over Pd/N-XC72R-6-300 catalyst. The kinetic
data were collected under the 0, 15, and 25 °C. The apparent
rate constant (k) can be defined as the following eq 1, where k is the rate constant, Ct is the nitrobenzene concentration in time, C0 is the initial nitrobenzene concentration, and t is the reaction time. 1   2   3  

The k increases with
the increase of temperature, as shown in Figure S7. According to the Arrhenius equation (eqs 2 and 3), the apparent
activation energies of the CTH of nitrobenzene on Pd/N-XC72R-6-300
are calculated to be 52.6 kJ·mol–1, the relative
lower activation energy makes the reaction be conducted at lower temperatures.36

2.4 Plausible Mechanism for
the Hydrogenation
of Nitrobenzene
According to the reported documents, the
hydrogenation of nitrobenzene is generally conducted via two routes.37,38 One way is to directly reduce the nitro group through hydroxylamine
and nitrosoarene as the intermediates. The other one is performed
via azobenzene and 1,2-diphenyl-hydrazine as the intermediates.

To gain insight into the possible mechanism of the CTH of nitrobenzene
catalyzed by Pd/N-XC72R, the CTH of azobenzene was conducted under
the identical conditions. The results indicated that the conversion
of azobenzene was much slower than that of nitrobenzene, which excluded
the possibility route via azobenzene as the intermediate for the Pd/N-XC72R
system. Therefore, it is exactly said that the transfer hydrogenation
of nitrobenzene was performed through the direct reduction route.38 No nitrosoarene and hydroxylamine intermediates
can be detected during the reaction process (based on GC analysis),
which can be ascribed to that the reactions were conducted rapidly,
and so the intermediates cannot be detected. Figure 4 shows the possible reaction mechanism; first,
the catalytic sites that are Pd nanoparticles, activated HCOOH to
yield Pd–H species, then the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene
was performed by depleting six hydrogen atoms bonded on the surface
of the Pd/N-XC72R catalyst. The nitrogen-containing species in the
N-XC72R may act as base sites, which may facilitate the adsorption
of the nitrobenzene and the corresponding oxygen-containing intermediate
molecules onto the surface of N-XC72R via the electrostatic interaction
between the electron-deficient nitrogen in nitrobenzene and the electron-rich
base sites in N-XC72R.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a facile and efficient process was established to prepare
nitrogen doping carbon by a one-step low-temperature pyrolysis of
commercially available carbon with urea. The nitrogen-containing species
incorporated into the carbon architecture enhanced the affinity of
metal nanoparticles onto the carbon support, thus preventing aggregation
and overgrowth of nanocrystals. Highly dispersed Pd supported on N-XC72R-6-300
showed excellent catalytic behavior for the CTH of nitroarenes. Our
strategy may provide a promising alternative approach to fabricate
nitrogen-doped carbon and ultrasmall metal nanoparticles catalyst,
which may find extensive applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Pd/N-XC72R
Typically,
1.0 g of XC-72R and 6 g of urea were physically grinded and then transferred
to a ceramic crucible and heated in a muffle furnace at 300 °C
for 6 h. After cooling to ambient temperature, the mixture was washed
with water and ethanol for three times. The obtained solid was named
as N-XC72R-6-300. A series of nitrided carbon, N-XC72R-X-T (X represents the mass ratio
of urea and XC-72R; T stands for the pyrolysis temperature),
was obtained through changing the calcined temperature and the mass
ratio of urea and XC-72R.

The Pd nanocatalyst supported on N-XC72R
was synthesized by a facile wet chemical impregnation and reduction
method. Typically, 100 mg of N-XC72R-6-300 was ultrasonically dispersed
in 5.0 mL of water and then mixed with 4.38 mL of H2PdCl4 aqueous solution (2 mg mL–1, 0.049 mmol
Pd). The resulted aqueous suspension was stirred for 1 h. Then, 30.0
mg of NaBH4 dissolved in 1.0 mL of 2.0 mol L–1 NaOH solution was added into the above suspension. The mixture was
stirred for 1.5 h at room temperature. The obtained catalyst was named
as Pd/N-XC72R-6-300. A series of catalysts, Pd/N-XC72R-X-T and Pd/XC72R, were prepared by the same method
except that the corresponding support was used. The actual palladium
concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectrometry.

4.2 Catalytic Reduction of
Nitro-Compounds
A mixture of AF (4 mmol), nitro compound
(1 mmol), catalyst (0.5
mol % Pd), FA (4 mmol), and solvent (5 mL, EtOH/H2O = 4:1)
was mixed. The mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 10–180
min (Table 2). The
reaction process was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction,
the products were extracted by dichloromethane (3 × 5 mL). The
structure of the products was confirmed by GC-MS.
