Gas-phase spectroscopic
detection of tiny carbon clusters is a
recent success story in the area of carbon cluster research. However,
experimental production and isolation of these clusters are extremely
difficult because of their high reactivity. One possibility to isolate
the generated clusters would be to deposit them on graphene and to
desorb them for subsequent use. One of the pertinent questions toward
realizing this would be the energetics of the adsorption process.
Therefore, in this work, the energetics for the adsorption of the
monocyclic carbon rings (Cn with n = 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22) on a graphene sheet
are investigated using the analytical approaches, developed earlier
by Hill and co-workers. The adsorption process here is driven by the
noncovalent interactions between the carbon rings and the graphene
sheet. The analyses of the interaction energies as a function of both
the vertical distance Z and the rotational angle
ϕ are performed in order to determine the preferred orientations,
equilibrium positions, and binding energies for the adsorption of
various carbon rings on graphene. We find that the preferred orientation
of the rings with respect to the graphene sheet is the parallel orientation.
The results from continuum, discrete–continuum, and discrete
models are in good agreement. Further, computations using density
functional theory and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approaches
are performed, and comparisons of the computed energetics with the
data from the models are reported. Finally, we highlight the scope
and the limitations of the analytical models.

Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional
nanomaterial reported for the first
time in 2004, possesses excellent electronic, mechanical, thermal,
chemical, optical, and transport properties.1−3 Since its discovery,
it has been widely used in nanoelectronic devices, transparent conductors,
nanocomposite materials, and more recently in biomedical applications,
such as drug loading and delivery.4−11 Owing to its large surface area and porous structure, graphene is
found to be an excellent adsorbent for atomic and molecular systems.
The adsorption properties of various atoms and molecules on graphene
have been examined theoretically and experimentally for potential
applications such as gas sensing and separation, filters for removing
toxic compounds, and chemical sensors for detecting molecules at small
concentrations.12−15 Hydrogen storage using graphene as a substrate has also drawn a
lot of attention in recent times.16

Carbon forms clusters more readily than any other element because
of its strong and directional covalent bonding character. Among the
carbon clusters, small clusters have attracted much attention from
both experimental and theoretical communities in recent years because
of their important role in various fields.17,18 There are astrophysical evidences for the presence of these clusters
in the chemistry of carbon stars and comets and in interstellar molecular
clouds as stable species or reactive intermediates.17,18 In particular, they have been proposed as possible carriers of the
diffuse interstellar bands.19,20 Small carbon clusters
are thought to be the building units of fullerenes, and various studies
suggest that carbon growth continues sequentially from linear chains
to monocyclic, bicyclic rings and eventually to fullerenes as a function
of cluster size.21−24 Tiny carbon clusters are known to be present in hydrocarbon flames
and other soot-forming systems.25−27 They are also thought to be intermediates
in the gas-phase chemistry taking place in chemical vapor deposition
systems for the production of thin diamond films.28 There are theoretical studies, indicating that some solids
synthesized from small carbon clusters are potential candidates for
carbon-based superconductors.29,30 It has been found that
the carbon clusters smaller than C10 possess low-energy
linear structures. When the cluster size increases from C10, the ring stability increases because of the reduction in angle
strain and the added stability arising from an additional C–C
bond. Theoretical studies have revealed that the most stable structures
for carbon clusters with 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 atoms are
monocyclic rings.31−38 It has been found in recent years that even for some small clusters
such as C4, C6, and C8, ring isomers
are isoenergetic with or are lower in energy than their linear counterparts.39−43 Among carbon rings, the C4n+2 rings
(C10, C14, C18, and C22 rings) attract special attention. The C4n+2 rings are suitable model systems for studying many-body quantum
effects because they exhibit a competition between Hückel aromaticity,
second-order Jahn–Teller effect, and Peierls instability at
large sizes, each of which favors different structures and the real
structure is a balance between these effects, which tends to vary
with the size of the ring.44−50 Monocyclic carbon rings are highly reactive, transient species and
are extremely difficult to produce and study in the laboratory. Even
though great progress has been made recently in observing and identifying
carbon rings unlike in the past where only linear chains were observed
in the vast majority of experimental studies,51−62 questions concerning the structure and chemistry of carbon rings
have been difficult to address because of their highly reactive nature
and the difficulty of isolating them experimentally.

In view
of the above, one might ask the following questions: (i)
can adsorption on graphene serve as a useful strategy for isolating
monocyclic carbon rings? (ii) What are the energetics for the adsorption
of various carbon rings on graphene? Therefore, in this article, the
adsorption of monocyclic carbon rings, Cn with n = 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22, on a graphene
sheet is investigated using an analytical approach, developed earlier
by Hill and co-workers.63−68 Continuum models for describing the interactions involving various
carbon-based systems have earlier been successfully employed in the
literature.69−72 The adsorption of a carbon ring on graphene is driven by the noncovalent
interactions between the ring and the graphene sheet, and consequently,
the interaction potential between two tiny elements on the ring and
the sheet can be described using the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential
function.73 The total interaction energy
between the ring and the sheet can be subsequently evaluated by adding
up the contributions from all of the tiny elements of the rings and
the sheet. The analytical study comprises the continuum, discrete–continuum,
and discrete models. The graphene sheet is modeled as an infinite
plane with continuous distribution of carbon atoms in continuum and
discrete–continuum models, whereas the carbon rings are treated
as circular rings of uniformly distributed carbon atoms in the continuum
model and as discrete atomic structures in the discrete–continuum
and discrete models. In the discrete model, graphene is represented
by circumcircumcoronene (C96H24). Detailed analyses
of the variation in the interaction energies as a function of both
the vertical distance Z and the rotational angle
ϕ are performed in order to determine the preferred orientations,
equilibrium positions, and the binding energies corresponding to the
adsorption of various carbon rings on the graphene sheet. The interaction
energy profiles obtained using the three models are compared, and
a good quantitative agreement is found. However, the continuum model
is found to be easier to handle mainly because of the fact that the
number of parameters needed is less when compared to the discrete–continuum
and discrete models. Finally, computations are performed using density
functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics
(QM/MM) approaches to assess the accuracy of the models in predicting
the energetics. We further describe the scope and the limitations
of the adopted models.

Theoretical Methodologies
We first
describe the methodologies for the continuum, discrete–continuum,
and discrete approaches. Subsequently, computational methods are described.
The adsorption of the carbon rings on graphene is driven by the noncovalent
interactions between the ring and the graphene sheet, and the interaction
potential between two tiny elements located on them can be described
using the well-known Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential function. The analytical
expression for the potential function is given by 1  where ρ
is the distance between the
interacting elements and A and B are, respectively, the Lennard-Jones attractive and repulsive constants.
The total interaction energies are evaluated as sums or integrals
of various point–point interactions. We use continuum, discrete–continuum,
and discrete models for describing the interactions between the carbon
rings and the graphene sheet. The graphene sheet is modeled as a continuum
structure in the continuum and discrete–continuum models, whereas
the carbon rings are treated as continuum structures in continuum
model and as discrete structures in the discrete–continuum
and discrete models. In the continuum representation, carbon rings
are denoted as circular rings of radii b with uniform
linear density of carbon atoms and the graphene sheet is represented
as an infinite sheet lying in the xy plane with uniform
density of carbon atoms. In the discrete–continuum and the
discrete models, carbon rings are treated as tiny atomic clusters
with well-defined geometries that are obtained by performing electronic
structure calculations on each of the rings. In the discrete model,
graphene is represented by a model system, circumcircumcoronene (C96H24), the geometry of which is also obtained from
the electronic structure calculations.

Continuum Model
In the continuum model, a carbon ring
is modeled as a circular ring of continuous distribution of carbon
atoms and a graphene sheet is represented by an infinite plane with
uniformly distributed carbon atoms. The relative position of a carbon
ring with respect to the graphene sheet is described by two parameters,
namely, the vertical distance Z from the plane to
the center of the ring and the rotational angle ϕ describing
the orientation of the ring with respect to the plane of the sheet,
wherein Z ∈ (0,∞) and ϕ ∈
[0,π/2]. A schematic illustrating the key parameters in the
continuum model for the interaction between a carbon ring and a graphene
sheet is illustrated in Figure 1. The total interaction energy between the ring and the graphene
sheet is given by64 2  where ρ =
[(b cos θ
– x)2 + (b sin
θ cos ϕ – y)2 + (b sin θ sin ϕ + Z)2]1/2 is the distance between the line element dτ
on the carbon ring and the surface element dσ on the graphene
sheet. nc and ng are the atomic line and surface densities of the carbon ring and
the graphene sheet, respectively. b refers to the
radius of the ring. The above equation for Econt can be rewritten as 3  where Jn is defined
by 4  

Figure 1 Schematic illustrating
the key parameters in the continuum model
for the interaction between a carbon ring and a graphene sheet.

The procedure for evaluating Jn has earlier been described
in detail by Hill and co-workers.64 The
final analytical expression for Jn can be written as 5  where F(x,y;z;t) is the
ordinary hypergeometric function.74,75

Discrete–Continuum
Model
In the discrete–continuum
model, a carbon ring is modeled as a discrete cluster of carbon atoms
and the graphene sheet is modeled as an infinite plane of uniformly
distributed carbon atoms. The relative positions of various carbon
atoms in the ring with respect to the graphene sheet are described
by the vertical offset distances ϵ of the atoms from the plane
of the sheet, as illustrated in Figure 2. The total interaction energy between a graphene sheet
and a carbon ring is given by the sum of the interaction energies
of each of the carbon atoms in the ring with the graphene sheet and
is given by 6  where ρi = [x2 + y2 + εi2]1/2 is the distance between a carbon
atom on the ring and a surface
element dσ on the graphene sheet. The above equation for Edis–con can be rewritten as 7  

Figure 2 Schematic illustrating the key parameters
in the discrete–continuum
model for the interaction between a carbon atom on a carbon ring and
a graphene sheet.

The procedure for evaluating
the integrals in eq 7 has been described earlier.64 The final
analytic expression for Edis–con can be written as 8  

The interaction energies
for various orientations of the rings
and for various positions of the centers of the rings with respect
to the graphene sheet can thus be evaluated if the corresponding vertical
offset positions of the carbon atoms in the rings are known.

Discrete
Model
In the discrete model, carbon rings
and graphene are represented as discrete atomistic structures. Graphene
is modeled by considering circumcircumcoronene (C96H24), which has earlier been employed as a model system for
graphene in numerous theoretical studies.76 The geometries of the rings and C96H24 are
obtained from electronic structure calculations. The interaction energies
are evaluated as a sum total of the contributions from individual
atom–atom pairs and can be written as 9  where ρij = [xij2 + yij2 + zij2]1/2 is the
distance between an atom on the ring and an atom on the graphene sheet.

Computational Methods
Computations are performed using DFT
and QM/MM approaches. In the
DFT study, the calculations are performed at the B97D level of theory.
B97D is a dispersion-corrected density functional which is being widely
used to describe long-range dispersion interactions in noncovalently
interacting systems77 and is therefore
appropriate for the study of the interactions reported in this study.
The geometry optimizations of the carbon rings (Cn), model system of graphene (C96H24),
and the carbon ring–graphene model complexes are carried out
at the B97D level of theory using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set in the
Materials Science Suite implemented in Schrödinger software.78 The single-point energy calculations are then
carried out at the 6-311G(d,p) level using the same functional (B97D/6-311G(d,p)//B97D/6-31G(d,p))
in Gaussian 09 software.79 The binding
energies for the adsorption of the carbon rings on graphene are computed
using 10  where Ecarbon ring and EC96H24 are
the energies of the isolated carbon ring and isolated C96H24, respectively. Ecomplex is the energy of the carbon ring–C96H24 complex. All of the reported binding energies are corrected for
the basis set superposition errors using the counterpoise correction
scheme.80 In the DFT study for the adsorption
of single carbon rings on graphene, many sites on the graphene model
are probed for adsorption and the geometries which exhibited maximum
binding energies corresponding to a single carbon ring–graphene
model pair are reported in this article.

In the QM/MM study,
the carbon rings form various QM components
and various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon models representing graphene
form the MM components. Graphene is represented by the model systems,
C54H18, C96H24, C150H30, and C216H36. The QM
components are treated at the B97D level of theory, and the MM component
is described using the universal force fields (UFFs).81 The geometry optimizations of the carbon rings (Cn) are carried out at the B97D level of theory using
the 6-31G(d,p) basis set, and the geometry optimizations of the graphene
models are carried out using the UFF scheme. The electrostatic interactions
between the QM and MM regions in the carbon ring–graphene model
complexes are accounted for using the electrostatic embedding scheme.
The geometry optimizations of the carbon ring–graphene model
complexes are carried out using the two-layered ONIOM (our own n-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics)
scheme implemented in the Gaussian 09 software at the same level at
which separate components are optimized.79 The single-point energies of the complexes are further calculated
at the ONIOM (B97D/6-311G(d,p):UFF//B97D/6-31G(d,p):UFF) level. The
binding energies of the carbon rings on the graphene models are given
by 11  Ecarbon ringQM is the energy of the carbon ring calculated
employing the DFT model, Egraphene modelMM is the energy of the graphene model
calculated employing the MM model, and EcomplexONIOM is the
ONIOM energy of the carbon ring–graphene model complex. In
the hybrid QM/MM study, similar to the DFT study, many sites on the
graphene models are probed for the adsorption of the carbon rings.
Binding energies calculated using various models for graphene are
compared, and conclusions are drawn based on them (see the Supporting Information for further details).
In addition to the calculations above, the energetics of adsorption
of dimers of some carbon rings on C216H24 are
also studied using the hybrid QM/MM method. The computational methodology
for this study is given in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
The energetics for the adsorption
of the C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, and C22 monocyclic carbon
rings on graphene are analyzed
by numerically evaluating the interaction energies based on the continuum,
discrete–continuum, and discrete models using Mathematica.82 We first describe the results of the continuum
model. Initially, electronic structure calculations are performed
at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level on each of the monocyclic carbon
rings using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.79 The radii of various carbon rings are then computed from
the optimized geometries of each of the rings (see Figure 3 and Table 1). The numerical values of the atomic line
densities (nc) of the carbon rings are
then obtained as the ratio of the total number of atoms to the circumference
of the rings (Table 1). The atomic surface density for the graphene sheet is taken to
be 0.3812 atoms/Å2.63 The
numerical values of the Lennard-Jones parameters, C–C attractive
constant, A, and C–C repulsive constant, B, used in our calculations are 17.4 eV·Å6 and 2.9 × 104 eV·Å12, respectively.63 We first discuss the
results of the numerical evaluation of the interaction energies as
a function of the vertical distance Z at various
rotational angles, ϕ for the binding of C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, and C22 on graphene. We analyze the adsorption of various
rings at ϕ = 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°
on graphene. The plots of the interaction energy as a function of
the vertical distance for the interaction of various carbon rings
with the graphene sheet at different rotational angles, evaluated
using eq 3, are shown
in Figure 4. When a
carbon ring is at very large distance from the graphene sheet (Z ≥ 12.0 Å), the interaction energy is zero.
As it approaches the sheet, the interaction energy decreases. When
the ring is sufficiently close to the graphene sheet, it experiences
strong repulsive interactions which then raise the interaction energy.
It is clear from Figure 4 and Table 2 that
the binding energies (negatives of the interaction energies) for each
of the rings decrease and the equilibrium distances between the ring
and the graphene sheet increase as ϕ varies from 0° to
90°. From Table 2, we also note that the binding energies for the interaction between
the rings and the graphene sheet increase as the number of carbon
atoms in the rings increases for all of the orientations. This is
to be expected because the total interaction energy is the sum total
of the contributions from all of the individual atom pairs formed
between the atoms of the carbon ring and the graphene sheet, and the
number of such pairs increases with the increase in the ring size.
The binding energies per carbon atom (Eba) for the adsorption of various carbon rings at various orientations
with respect to the graphene sheet are given in the Supporting Information (see Table S1 and Figure S1).

We now discuss the results of the numerical evaluation
of the interaction
energies as a function of the rotational angle ϕ for the adsorption
of C10, C12, C14, C16,
C18, C20, and C22 on graphene at
various vertical positions of the rings with respect to the sheet.
The plots of the interaction energy as a function of ϕ for various
values of Z evaluated using eq 3 are shown in Figures 5–7. It can be observed from Figures 5–7 that there
are three different domains of interaction energy profiles corresponding
to various values of Z and the range of these domains
is different for each ring. The first energy profile domain corresponds
to the case where the ring is near the graphene surface. In this domain,
the minimum energy is always obtained at ϕ = 0°. In other
words, in this domain, the orientation at which the interaction energy
is minimum is the parallel orientation. The second domain corresponds
to the situation where the ring is at an intermediate distance from
the graphene sheet, and the parallel orientation is no longer the
minimum energy configuration. Rather, a tilted orientation is preferred.
The third domain corresponds to values of Z for which
the ring is far from the graphene sheet, and the minimum energy is
obtained at ϕ = 90°, indicating that the perpendicular
orientation is the most preferred orientation in this domain. It can
be observed from Figure 5 that the preferred orientation is the parallel orientation for all
of the rings at Z = 3.5 Å. For Z ≥ 4.0 Å, the parallel orientation is no longer preferred.
Rather, a tilted/perpendicular orientation is preferred. At Z = 4.5 and 5.0 Å, all of the rings prefer tilted orientation
(see Figure 6 and Table 3). It can be seen
from Figure 6 that
all of the rings except the C10 ring prefer tilted orientation
at Z = 5.5 Å. The C10 ring prefers
perpendicular orientation at Z = 5.5 Å. On similar
lines, we find that the C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, and C22 rings turn to
perpendicular orientation at Z = 5.8, 6.2, 6.6, 7.0,
7.4, and 7.8 Å, respectively. At Z = 9.0 Å,
all of the rings prefer perpendicular orientation for adsorption on
graphene (see Table 3). The domains of Z values for the binding of each
of the rings on the graphene sheet are summarized in Table 4. All of the rings prefer parallel
orientation at short distances, to attain favorable π–π
interactions, maximizing interactions between various atom–atom
pairs. At larger distances, the rings prefer tilted orientation, eventually
going to perpendicular orientation as this enables some atoms to get
closer to the sheet. In other words, it is not possible to maximize
atom–atom interactions at large distances for parallel orientations.
However, larger rings experience more repulsions than smaller rings
upon tilting as some of the ring atoms are too close to the graphene
sheet and repulsive terms become dominant. Therefore, the distances
at which larger rings switch to perpendicular configuration increase
with the increase in the ring size.

We now present the results obtained
using the discrete–continuum
model. The interaction energies in the discrete–continuum model
are evaluated using eq 8, provided that the vertical offset distances of various carbon atoms
of the rings with respect to the graphene sheet are known. We illustrate
the results here for the adsorption of the C14 and C20 rings on graphene. The vertical offset distances of the
carbon atoms of the C14 ring and the C20 ring
(carbon atoms of the rings labeled in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information) from the graphene sheet
at various vertical positions of the ring centers and at various rotational
angles are given in the Supporting Information (Tables S2 and S3). The vertical positions of the ring centers chosen
for each orientation correspond to the positions in the lowest energy
configurations obtained using the continuum model (see Table 2). The vertical offset distances
for various atoms in the rings at various orientations are computed
from their optimized geometries obtained from electronic structure
calculations using Chemcraft.83 A comparison
of the computed binding energies from the continuum model and the
discrete–continuum model for the adsorption of the C14 and C20 rings on graphene at various values of ϕ
and Z is shown in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.
The binding energies obtained using the two approaches are in very
good agreement. Out of the two models described here, the continuum
model is relatively easier to handle because the number of parameters
needed in the continuum model is less compared to that of the discrete–continuum
model where one needs the vertical offset distances of each of the
atoms in the ring at various positions of the ring centers and at
various orientations.

We now compare the results obtained so far
from the continuum and
discrete–continuum models with those obtained from the discrete
model. In the discrete model, graphene is represented by circumcircumcoronene,
C96H24. From the results of the continuum model,
it is clear that the preferred orientation of the rings is the parallel
orientation. Therefore, the discrete model calculations are performed
on various ring–C96H24 complexes for
the ϕ = 0° case. The interaction energies are evaluated
from the position coordinates of the optimized geometries of the rings
and C96H24 obtained from electronic structure
calculations by using eq 9. The numerical values of the Lennard-Jones parameters, C–H
attractive constant, A, and C–H repulsive
constant, B, used in our calculations are 5.62 eV·Å6 and 9.2 × 104 eV·Å12, respectively.63,84 A comparison of the computed
binding energies from the continuum model and the discrete model for
the adsorption of various carbon rings on graphene is shown in Table 7. The binding energies
obtained using the two approaches are in good agreement.

Thus, we infer that
the continuum model, discrete–continuum
model, and discrete model could be very insightful in assessing the
energetics of the adsorption of carbon rings on graphene. It is possible
to arrive at interesting physical insights on the distance and the
orientation dependence of the energetics using such approaches, which
could otherwise have been difficult to obtain using quantum chemical
calculations because they demand extensive computational time. However,
the adopted models possess some limitations. Although the continuum
model is the easiest to implement, it suffers from the loss of details
of the atomistic picture because the rings and the sheet are represented
by uniform densities of carbon atoms. On the other hand, the discrete
model suffers from the not-so-accurate representation of the graphene
sheet by the C96H24 model system. Interestingly,
within the framework of the continuum and discrete–continuum
models employed here, we see that the equilibrium distance for the
rings when they are parallel to the graphene sheet turns out to be Z = 3.44 Å irrespective of the size of the ring (Table 2). When the rings
are oriented parallel to the graphene surface, ϕ = 0° and
the Jn term in the continuum
approach (eq 5) reduces
to 12  

Therefore, the Z-dependence of the interaction
energy reduces to 13  

Now, the minimum in the interaction energy
would correspond to
dEcont/dZ = 0, solving
which we obtain Z = 3.44 Å. Indeed, an analysis
of the interaction energy term in the discrete–continuum model
as given in eq 8 also
yields the same result. When ϕ = 0°, for a given Z, all of the atoms in a given ring have the same vertical
offset distance ε. Therefore, 14  where N is the total
number
of atoms in the ring. Again, the minimum in Edis–con corresponds to dEdis–con/dε = 0, implying ε = 3.44 Å. Thus, we see that
within the framework of the models that we employ, minimum energy
configurations for the binding of all of the monocyclic rings on graphene
for parallel orientation correspond to a vertical distance of 3.44
Å from the sheet. This is however not what one would expect and
could be seen as a limitation of the models that are employed for
the analysis. The formalisms of continuum and discrete–continuum
models that we have employed do not also take into account the structural
distortions in the interacting entities. In the continuum model, the
clusters are treated as rings of uniform carbon density. Therefore,
spacings between the carbon atoms are uniform. In the discrete–continuum
model, the clusters possess the geometries obtained from our electronic
structure calculations. When the distance and orientation dependence
of the energetics are analyzed, the geometries of the clusters remained
the same. Detailed electronic structure calculations are however expected
to reveal subtle variations in the geometrical parameters when the
rings are bound on graphene in the complexes. Therefore, in order
to assess the performance of the analytical approaches, quantum chemical
calculations based on electronic structure theory are also performed.
With an intention to compare the energetics calculated using a hierarchy
of levels of theory, we performed computations using DFT and QM/MM
approaches. The DFT approach, although more accurate, is restrictive
on the size of the model of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used to
represent graphene. The QM/MM approach, on the other hand, although
less accurate, enables us to consider much larger polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon models within a reasonable computational time. We believe
that such a detailed comparison of the energetics from a hierarchy
of theories can enable researchers to infer optimal strategies to
be adopted for modeling a given system. Results of the analytical
models are compared with data from the computational approaches. For
illustration purposes, one representative example set for each approach,
Cn–C96H24 complexes for the DFT approach and Cn–C216H36 complexes for the QM/MM approach
are considered here. For more details, we refer the readers to the Supporting Information (Table S4 and Figures
S3–S5). The optimized geometries of the Cn–C96H24 complexes obtained using
the DFT approach are shown in Figure 8. A comparison of the binding energies and binding
energies per carbon atom obtained using the analytical, DFT, and QM/MM
approaches is presented in Figure 9. As can be seen from Figure 9, the total binding energies increase with
the increase in the ring size, whereas the binding energies per carbon
atom remain more or less the same. Interestingly, the binding energies
obtained using the DFT approach reveal a zig-zag pattern with the
increase in the ring size. The C4n rings
are found to possess higher binding energies than the C4n+2 rings. This feature is unique to the DFT approach
and is not captured by either the analytical models or the QM/MM approach.
The QM/MM approach yields binding energies closer to the DFT data
than the analytical models, suggesting that they are more accurate
than the analytical approaches. The discrepancies in the computed
binding energy values of the analytical models from those of the DFT
results are to be expected because the models are based on the Lennard-Jones
potential and do not explicitly account for the electronic structure
of rings and graphene. In contrast, the DFT results are based on one
of the state-of-the-art density functionals that is proven to be highly
accurate for describing noncovalent interactions. However, in view
of the fact that the analytical calculations can be performed at minimal
computational cost, we attempted to fit the DFT binding energy data
to the analytical expression of the derivative of the interaction
energy (eq 3) for ϕ
= 0°. We note here that the interaction energy derivatives yield
the minimum energy configurations. Such a fitting enabled us to arrive
at the modified Lennard-Jones A and B parameters which are found to be 14.61 eV·Å6 and 1003 eV·Å12, respectively. Subsequently,
the binding energies are recalculated using the modified A and B parameters in the continuum approach, and
the results are presented in Figure 9 as black traces. It is clear from the figure that
the modified parameters yield the binding energy values that are much
closer to the DFT data and can be employed for further investigations
involving carbon ring–graphene and carbon ring–carbon
nanotube systems. Indeed, one of the objectives of the analytical
approaches based on the continuum approximation is to develop optimal
model parameters that could be seamlessly adapted to various carbon-based
systems for describing interactions with reasonable accuracy at a
minimal computational cost.

using the DFT approach.

Figure 9 Comparison of the binding energies and binding energies per carbon
atom (Eba) in various carbon ring–graphene
complexes obtained using the analytical and computational approaches.

Furthermore, we have studied the
possibility of multiple ring adsorption
on graphene. The strengths of binding of two C10 and two
C18 rings on graphene in the parallel orientation (because
parallel orientation is the most preferred orientation) are analyzed
as representative examples. Herein, two configurations, namely, stacked
and side-by-side configurations (Figure 10; optimized geometries of the complexes
for C10 obtained at the QM/MM level), are investigated.
The total interaction energy in each case is given by the sum total
of the constituent ring–ring and ring–sheet interaction
energies. The ring–ring interaction energies in the continuum
approach are evaluated using the formalism (eqs 4 and 6) of Hill and
co-workers.84 Initially, the ring–ring
interaction energies are computed for the stacked and side-by-side
configurations. The binding energies for the side-by-side configuration
are found to be very small when compared to the binding energies for
the stacked configuration (Table 8). However, the total binding energies are higher for
the side-by-side configuration than those for the stacked configuration.
Therefore, it is clear that when multiple carbon rings adsorb on graphene,
they prefer the side-by-side configuration. It is interesting to note
that the continuum approach can be very insightful in exploring the
possibility of the adsorption of multiple species on graphene. On
the other hand, electronic structure calculations for the binding
of multiple rings on graphene are computationally very expensive.
We refer the readers to the Supporting Information (Table S5) for some representative calculations performed at the
QM/MM level that yield results qualitatively similar to those found
from the continuum approach.

Finally,
we comment on the relevance of this work in the context
of current research on carbon clusters and graphene. Adsorption of
various gas molecules and organic molecules on graphene was earlier
investigated by several groups.13,15 Detection of individual
gas molecules adsorbed on graphene further provided an impetus to
this area.12 Recently, gas-phase spectroscopy
experiments by Maier and co-workers have enabled detection of several
of the carbon clusters.19,20,61,62 Vacuum-ultraviolet photolysis
of methane at low temperature has also resulted in carbon clusters.62 Therefore, in this work, we have considered
using graphene as a substrate for the adsorption of highly reactive
monocyclic carbon rings and studied the energetics for the adsorption
process. Our investigation of the energetics is primarily based on
the continuum approximation for carbon-based materials and has led
to the prediction of optimal binding configurations (vertical positions
and orientations) for the adsorption of various rings. Such configurations
can be convenient starting points for more detailed quantum chemical
calculations.85,86 Further, we hope that the adsorption
of tiny carbon clusters on graphene will soon be realized in experiments.

Conclusions
The energetics for the adsorption of the monocyclic carbon rings,
Cn (n = 10, 12, 14, 16,
18, 20, and 22), on graphene are studied using the continuum, discrete–continuum,
and discrete models. In the continuum and discrete–continuum
models, the graphene sheet is treated as an infinite plane of uniformly
distributed carbon atoms. In the continuum model, carbon rings are
treated as circular rings with uniform line density of carbon atoms,
whereas in the discrete–continuum and discrete models, they
are treated as discrete collections of carbon atoms whose position
coordinates are obtained from electronic structure calculations. Further,
graphene is represented by circumcircumcoronene (C96H24) in the discrete model. Analyses of the interaction energies
as a function of the vertical distances Z and the
rotational angles ϕ are performed in order to determine the
preferred orientations, equilibrium positions, and binding energies
for the adsorption of various monocyclic carbon rings on graphene.
A carbon ring is found to be adsorbed on graphene in three stages:
the perpendicular configuration, the tilted configuration, and the
parallel configuration, and the preferred orientation is the parallel
configuration. We find that the effect of tilting is more pronounced
for the larger carbon rings than that for the smaller carbon rings.
Furthermore, the results from various models are compared with the
computational data obtained using DFT and QM/MM approaches, highlighting
the scope as well as the limitations of the analytical approaches.
The analytical models that we have used are important both because
of their low computational cost and ability to provide useful physical
insights into the energetics of adsorption.
