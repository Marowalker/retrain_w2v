Symmetrical electrochemical capacitors
are attracting immense attention
because of their fast charging–discharging ability, high energy
density, and low cost of production. The current research in this
area is mainly focused on exploring novel low-cost electrode materials
with higher energy and power densities. In the present work, we fabricated
an electrochemical double-layer capacitor using methylammonium bismuth
iodide (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, a lead-free, zero-dimensional hybrid perovskite material.
A maximum areal capacitance of 5.5 mF/cm2 was obtained,
and the device retained 84.8% of its initial maximum capacitance even
after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles. Impedance spectroscopy
measurements revealed that the active layer provides a high surface
area for the electrolyte to access. As a result, the charge transport
resistance is reasonably low, which is advantageous for delivering
excellent performance.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic
halide perovskite materials captured the
attention of scientific community during the past few years because
of their unique optical and electronic properties.1−5 Three-dimensional hybrid perovskites with a general
formula of AMX3 (A = methylammonium or formamidinium cation;
M = Pb2+, Sn2+, etc., and X = I, Br, and Cl)
are highlighted as efficient light-absorbing layers in solar cells
with an efficiency surpassing 22%.6−8 Apart from photovoltaic
applications, these materials are promising for light-emitting diodes,
photodetectors, sensors, memories, and so forth.9−20 The widespread applications of this class of materials could be
attributed to their properties such as tunable band gap, large absorption
coefficient, high electron and hole diffusion lengths, good charge
carrier mobility, ease of defect state formation, and excellent ion
migration.21−23 Even though hybrid perovskites exhibit very interesting
properties and are useful for a large number of applications, the
toxicity of lead and instability in the presence of moisture and oxygen
are prime concerns preventing their commercialization.24−26

Storage of energy is as important as its production. Development
of novel, environmentally friendly, and sustainable energy storage
devices has attracted considerable research attention in modern times
because of the rapid depletion of unsustainable fossil fuels and environmental
deterioration, which are also necessary to satisfy the demands of
the fast-growing electronic industry. Electrochemical capacitors with
long life span, high power density, and fast charge–discharge
characteristics are regarded as excellent energy storage devices,
as they have the potential to complement or even replace batteries
in numerous applications.27 However, their
low energy density is a limiting factor in their widespread practical
applications. Hence, the current research in electrochemical capacitors
is mainly focused on exploring novel low-cost electrode materials
with higher energy and power densities.28 In this context, hybrid perovskite materials are promising because
of their high ionic conductivity; a recent study suggests that the
ionic conductivity of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) is higher than its electronic conductivity.29 By exploring this property, Zhao et al. have reported a
MAPbI3-based thin-film electrochemical double-layer capacitor
(EDLC).30 The capacitance obtained was
5.89 μF/cm2, which proved that hybrid perovskite
materials are good candidates for capacitor applications. However,
the toxicity of lead is a major factor of concern here also.

Results
and Discussion
In this work, we have explored the potential
of methylammonium
bismuth iodide (MBI), which is a lead-free, zero-dimensional perovskite
having a unit cell formula of (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, for energy storage applications. This
bismuth-based perovskite is an environment-friendly alternative with
better atmospheric stability than that of the corresponding lead-based
perovskites. The unit cell of MBI consists of isolated Bi2I93– units surrounded by methylammonium
cations (Figure 1a).
Bi2I93– is formed through
face sharing of two BiI63– octahedra.
We have hypothesized that the isolated Bi2I93– bioctahedra can supply vacant spaces and large
surface area so that the electrolyte can easily access the active
material, resulting in enhanced ionic charge transport. This would
lead to capacitors having high energy density. To prove this, we have
fabricated capacitor devices with the MBI material and analyzed them
using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge,
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The charge
transport resistance obtained from the impedance measurement was small,
which was in agreement with the large surface area provided by the
material.

XRD of MBI.

(CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 was characterized
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption, and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) spectroscopy. The TEM image of MBI is shown in Figure 1b which indicates that the
material forms a thin film of interconnected MBI crystals. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the material is
shown in Figure 1c,
and the corresponding electron diffraction pattern is shown in the
inset. The diffraction pattern shows lattice distances of 3.51, 3.62,
and 3.74 Å corresponding to the (202), (006), and (105) lattice
planes, respectively. Clear visibility of the lattice planes and the
hexagonal array of bright spots indicate that the material is highly
crystalline. MBI exhibited a broad absorption ranging from 300 to
600 nm in the UV–vis absorption spectrum (Figure 1d). The optical band gap of
MBI calculated from the onset of the absorption was 2.22 eV. XRD patterns
obtained from powdered samples, which are in good agreement with the
previous reports,31 revealed the hexagonal
crystal structure of the material, with the characteristic perovskite
doublet peak at 2θ = ∼12° (Figure 1e). The XRD profile of the material was studied
over a period of 1 month (Figure S1, Supporting Information). No variation in peak position or intensity was
observed, which indicated the good stability of the material under
ambient conditions.

For analyzing the electrochemical energy
storage performance of
the material, MBI was coated on a carbon cloth substrate having an
area of 1 cm2, which was used as the electrode. A polymer
separator soaked in an electrolytic solution (30 mg/mL methylammonium
iodide in butanol) was sandwiched between the MBI-containing electrodes
to form a symmetric capacitor. Additives (5 wt %) such as polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) and activated carbon were added during the preparation of the
electrode for proper binding of the perovskite material on to the
carbon substrate and for improving the conductivity of the active
layer. A simplified schematic representation of the device is shown
in Figure 2a. The thickness
of the active film was about 400 nm as measured from the cross-sectional
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image which is shown in Figure 2b. The perovskite
material was uniformly coated over the carbon cloth substrate, as
shown in the topological SEM image (Figure 2c). The root-mean-square roughness of the
film obtained from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height image
(Figure 2d) was 16.7
nm, which means that the surface roughness of the film was reasonably
high. Such a high surface roughness is good for energy storage applications
because the electrolyte can strongly interact with the active layer.
The high surface roughness of the film is in good agreement with the
topological SEM image, which showed relatively large MBI crystals
(Figure 2c).

representation of the MBI-based double-layer capacitor
device. (b) Cross-sectional SEM image of the capacitor electrode.
(c) Topological SEM image and (d) AFM height image of the MBI film.

The symmetric EDLC assembly was
then sandwiched in a standard electrochemical
cell (ECC-std, EL-CELL GmbH), and the capacitive performance was evaluated
by CV, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and EIS techniques.
The CV loops did not show any peaks during forward and reverse scans
which indicates that the electrodes are charged and discharged at
a constant rate during a complete voltammetric cycle (Figure 3a). It is clearly found that
the areal capacitance value was decreasing with an increase in applied
scan rate or current density (Figure S2, Supporting Information). This property implies the EDLC behavior of the
device, which means that at lower scan rates, ions are getting enough
time to occupy the vacant spaces supplied by the MBI perovskite film
and at higher scan rates, the charge accumulation happens only at
the electrode surface.

charge–discharge
curves. (c) Capacitance retention as a function of the number of cycles.
(d) Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit diagram as an inset.

The galvanostatic charge–discharge
curve was symmetrical,
which is a characteristic of an ideal EDLC behavior (Figure 3b).32 The results obtained from the charge–discharge measurements
were in good agreement with those from CV measurements, indicating
that no surface redox reactions are happening in the device in the
given voltage range. The long-term cycling stability of the capacitor
device was evaluated from repetitive galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements for 10 000 cycles at a current density of 2 mA
cm–2. The capacitor retained 84.8% capacitance of
its initial value even after 10 000 cycles (Figure 3c). The Nyquist plot and the
equivalent circuit diagram are shown in Figure 3d. In the equivalent circuit diagram, the
electrolyte solution resistance (Rs) was
connected in series to the double-layer capacitance (CDL). RCT is the charge-transfer
resistance of the electroactive material, and ZW is the Warburg impedance associated with ion diffusion in
the electrolyte. The charge-transfer resistance (RCT) of the electroactive perovskite material was calculated
from the diameter of the semicircle in the higher frequency range
of the Nyquist plot and was found to be 50 Ω. The X-intercept
of the semicircle arc in the Nyquist plot gives the value of Rs, which is also known as the equivalent series
resistance. The lower Rs value (21 Ω)
is due to the large electrolyte-accessible surface area provided by
the zero-dimensional MBI. This implies that during the charging process,
MA+ and I– ions from the electrolyte
can easily access the active perovskite material and in the discharge
process, these ions move toward the electrolyte. The straight line
in the low-frequency region of the Nyquist plot making an angle of
45° with the X-axis represents the Warburg impedance
associated with the ion diffusion in the electrolyte.33 On the other hand, during the discharging process, MA+ and I– ions accumulated at the perovskite/electrolyte
interface move toward the electrolyte. Because the Bi2I93– octahedra are rigid, the ionic contribution
from the perovskite layer will be negligibly small, and thus the perovskite
layer acts as an electrode.

The MAPbI3 perovskite-based
electrochemical capacitor
reported by Zhao et al. exhibited a capacitance of 5.89 μF/cm2. On the other hand, our material has a capacitance of 5.5
mF/cm2, which is almost 1000 times higher than that of
the above-mentioned material. It should also be noted that the toxicity
and moisture instability of MAPbI3 may prevent its practical
applications. The lead-free Bi-based hybrid perovskite used in the
present work was stable for several months under ambient conditions.
The performance of the capacitor devices can be further enhanced by
engineering the perovskite material by varying metal ions, organic
cations, and electrolytes in addition to the device architecture.

Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, we have fabricated a lead-free
perovskite material-based symmetric EDLC. A maximum areal capacitance
of 5.5 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 5 mV/s was obtained. According
to our knowledge, this is the highest value of capacitance reported
so far for a hybrid perovskite-based EDLC. Moreover, our findings
confirmed that MBI perovskite is an excellent material for EDLC applications.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Bismuth(III) iodide (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich),
methylammonium iodide (98%, TCI Chemicals), and N,N-dimethyl formamide (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) were
used without any further purification.

Synthesis of a Powder (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 (MBI)
Material
Bismuth(III)
iodide (0.9729 g) (1.649 mM, 1 equiv) and 0.3934 g of methylammonium
iodide (2.474 mM, 1.5 equiv) were dissolved in 1 mL of dimethylformamide
(DMF) and heated at 70 °C on a hot plate with constant stirring
overnight for complete dissolution. Then, the solution was transferred
into a Petri dish and heated to 100 °C for about 4 h for the
complete removal of DMF. The obtained powder perovskite material was
used for further studies.

Characterization
Electronic absorption
spectra were
recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer. For
the measurement, the powder perovskite material was kept in between
two transparent quartz plates and measured in the reflectance mode.
Using Kubelka–Munk function, the reflectance spectra were converted
into absorption spectra. XRD studies were carried out on the powder
samples with Xeuss simultaneous 2D WAXS/SAXS using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5418 Å). The topological and cross-sectional SEM
imaging of the device was performed by subjecting the device to thin
gold coating using a JEOL JFC—1200 fine coater. The probe side
was inserted into a JEOL JSM-5600 LV scanning electron microscope
for imaging. AFM image was recorded under ambient conditions using
an NTEGRA (NT-MDT) operated in the tapping mode regime. Microfabricated
thin cantilever tips (NSG 10) with a resonance frequency of 299 kHz
and a spring constant of 20–80 N m–1 were
used. The morphology and electron diffraction pattern of the perovskite
material were studied by using an FEI-Tecnai T30 high-resolution transmission
electron microscope, at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV.

Preparation
of Electrodes
The presynthesized MBI was
mixed with a PTFE binder and activated charcoal in a weight ratio
of 85:10:5 and dispersed in ethanol. The resulting mixture was homogenized
by ultrasonication and coated onto a conductive carbon cloth (ELAT,
NuVant Systems Inc.) substrate, having an area of 1 cm2, via a drop-casting method, which was followed by drying at 60 °C
for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The two electrodes were separated by a
thin polymer separator (Celgard 3501) in a 30 mg/mL methylammonium
iodide/butanol electrolyte and were sandwiched in a capacitor test
cell (ECC-std, EL-CELL GmbH).

Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical properties
of the capacitor electrodes were studied by symmetric assemblies of
the material in a two-electrode configuration by CV, galvanostatic
charge–discharge, and EIS using a VMP3 BioLogic electrochemical
workstation. The two-electrode configuration is preferred as it provides
the most reliable results of the performance of a material for electrochemical
capacitors. The cell capacitance (C in F) was then
calculated from the CV curves according to eq 1 or from the charge–discharge curves
according to eq 2 1  where
“i” is
the average cathodic current of the CV loop and “s” is the scan rate. 2  where “I” is
the constant current for charge–discharge and ΔV/Δt is the slope of the discharge
curve. The areal capacitance (Careal in
F/cm2) was then calculated as 3  where “A” is
the area of each electrode.
