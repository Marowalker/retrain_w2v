Three modified 1,2,4-trizaole derivatives
were synthesized and compounded in pairs. Their structures were confirmed
by 1H NMR and ESI-MS. Antibacterial tests were proceeded
to evaluate the fungicidal activity of synthesized compounds. The
results of antibacterial tests showed that the synthesized compounds
exhibited good antibacterial activities against Coriolus
versicolor, Gloeophyllum trabeum, Trichoderma viride, and Aspergillus niger at a ratio of 5:5. In order to
improve the water solubility of target products, emulsification experiments
were carried out and beta-cypermethrin was added as a pesticide. The
appropriate emulsifier types and dosage ratios for the synthesized
compounds were finally screened out.

Introduction
Wood preservative
is an important measure for extending the life
span of wood.1 Common wood preservatives
include coal phenolic oil wood preservatives, oil-borne wood preservatives,
and waterborne wood preservatives.2 In
spite of high efficiency of antibacterial activity, traditional wood
preservatives have certain toxicity and demand for a large amount
of solvents, which are harmful to humans and the environment.3 Therefore, development of novel wood preservatives
with higher efficacy and lower toxicity is always necessary.4

Triazole fungicides are widely used as
pesticides which refer to a series of compounds containing 1,2,4-triazole
groups in the main chain.5 In recent years,
the derivatives of 1,2,4-trizaole had been applied in the preservation
of wood.6 Because of strong systemic, broad-spectrum,
high-efficiency, and low toxicity to humans and animals, it has a
good application prospect in wood preservation.7 However, the water solubility of triazole fungicides is
relatively poor. They could only be dissolved in some organic solvents.8,9 Therefore, it is imperative to emulsify them by an emulsifier. Herein,
we synthesized three modified 1,2,4-trizaole derivatives (Figure 1) and emulsified
them to improve the water solubility after compounding in pairs. The
beta-cypermethrin was added as a pesticide. Antibacterial tests were
carried out to determine the antibacterial activity of target products.10

Results and Discussion
NMR Data of Target Compound
Antibacterial Activity
From the analysis
of 1H NMR and MS, the structures of target products are
consistent with the design structures (see Table 1). The results of antibacterial tests at
a single drug concentration of 0.5% (see Table 2) show that the compounded agents and each
original agent have good antibacterial effect against Coriolus versicolor and Gloeophyllum
trabeum, and the performance of the modified compound
is better than that of the original one. Hex-1 achieves the best performance
among the six single agents. The performance of the compounded drug
is better than the original agent at a compounding ratio of 5:5, and
Hex-1/Tri-1 = 5:5 is optimal. For the two molds, the activities of
modified target compounds are also better than that of unmodified
original agents, and the performance of Hex-1 is optimal. At the same
time, the drug, which Flu-1 and Tri-1 compounded at a ratio of 5:5,
shows a remarkable antibacterial activity.

In order to visually
investigate the antibacterial effect of the experimental synthetic
products, the results of antibacterial tests were photographed (Table 3).

Activity of Target Compounds
Emulsification
According to the basic
physical and chemical properties of the solvent, eight conventional
solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, cyclohexanone, N,N-dimethylformamide, and acetone were
initially selected to determine the solubility of the original drug.
The results are shown in Table 4. The solubility properties were determined by the mass of
the solvent required to completely dissolve the original agents per
unit mass (1 g).

As can be seen from Table 4, xylene, methanol, ethanol, acetone, isopropanol,
and n-butanol all have problems of poor solubility,
and there is the problem of environmental pollution. Tri-1 and BC
have good solubility in acetone, but acetone has a low boiling point
and is extremely volatile. A large amount of the solvent is required
when dissolving the original drug with methanol, ethanol, isopropanol,
or n-butanol. Moreover, the volatility of methanol
and ethanol is relatively high. Considering the properties of these
eight solvents and their dissolution of each of the original drugs,
cyclohexanone and DMF are more advantageous. It has been found through
experiments that cyclohexanone and DMF can be mixed in a certain ratio
for compounding active ingredients.

After screening tests for
compounding emulsifiers, calcium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (500#),
potassium ethylxanthate (601#), and 4-nonyl phenol diethoxylate (NP-10P)
were selected as appropriate emulsifiers for three kinds of compounded
drugs. The mixed drug emulsified by 601# and 500# showed a good performance
at dispersity. However, the stability of HFB-1 is not as good as the
others. A precipitation phenomenon occurred after a period of static
placing. Therefore, we added 8% NP-10P to replace a portion of 500#.
With continuous optimization of the dosage ratio, the preparation
of the microemulsions of the three compounded drugs was finally determined
(Table 5).

Conclusions
In summary,
three target compounds were synthesized and their structures were
confirmed by 1H NMR and ESI-MS. The results of the antibacterial
tests indicated that the target compounds exhibited good antibacterial
activity. According to the ratio of traditional triazole preservatives
to emulsifiers and pesticides, the optimal compounding ratio was determined,
and the preparation method of waterborne composite organic wood preservatives
was studied. When the compounding ratio is 5:5, the combined inhibitory
effect of the organic matter on the mold and the decaying fungus is
significant. The three emulsifiers are mixed in an appropriate proportion
to achieve a good emulsification effect.

General Procedure
for Compound Tri-1
3a. Synthesis of α-Chloro-2,4-difluoroacetophenone
In
a 250 mL three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a constant
pressure funnel, and a condenser (with a drying tube), m-difluorobenzene (0.1 mol, 14.7 g) and aluminum trichloride (0.17
mol, 22.7 g) was added. After the mixture was stirred at 30–35
°C for 0.5 h, chloroacetyl chloride (0.12 mol, 13.56 g) was slowly
added dropwise to control the reaction temperature. After the completion

°C, and stirring was continued until the hydrogen chloride gas
was not generated in the reaction system (i.e., no bubbles appeared
in the reaction system), and the reaction was maintained for 5 h.
The flask containing the reaction mixture was placed in an ice water
bath. The temperature of the reactants was lowered to below 5 °C,
and 20 mL of hydrochloric acid of 3 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added
dropwise to control the dropping rate, and the temperature of the
mixture did not change much. The acidified mixture was poured into
a beaker, and sufficient distilled water was added thereto to precipitate
a solid, which was filtered under reduced pressure and dried to give
a pale yellow powdery solid (16.9 g). The pale yellow powdery solid
was recrystallized from n-hexane to give bright yellow

were added and stirred for 10 min. Under an ice bath, α-chloro-2,4-difluoroacetophenone
(0.1 mol, 19.1 g) in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was added
dropwise. After the addition was completed, the ice bath was removed
and the reaction was carried out for 6 h at room temperature. Then,
the residue is filtered off and the solvent is recovered under reduced
pressure to obtain a crude product. The crude product was poured into
ice water (500 mL), and the crude product was dissolved by adding
1 mol/L hydrochloric acid (120 mL). The insoluble oil was removed
by standing layering, and the aqueous layer was neutralized to pH
6 with NaHCO3 (8 g). The organic layer was extracted with
ethyl acetate (50 mL). The reaction product can be further purified
by recrystallizing a white solid.

3c. Synthesis of 1-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)-1-hydroxy-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-ethane

equipped with a constant pressure dropping funnel, 3c (0.0293 mol, 6.6 g) and pyridine (10 mL) was added, stirred, and
slowly add p-chlorobenzoyl chloride (0.0322 mol,
5.64 g) dropwise. After the completion, the reaction was carried out
at room temperature for 3 h. After washing 3 times with 5% hydrochloric
acid, the organic layer was separated, and the organic phase was washed
with water to neutral, then evaporated, and washed with methanol and
dried to give 9.2 g of the white solid.

Total yield 35.5%. The
melting point value of the synthesized compound is 139–140
°C.

Antibacterial
Test
Two kinds of rot fungus and two kinds of mold, C. versicolor, G. trabeum, Trichoderma viride, and Aspergillus niger, were selected to proceed with
the antibacterial test for their representativeness and strong growth
activity. The antibacterial test was carried out by the filter paper
diffusion method. The antibacterial agent dissolved and diffused continuously
in the medium to form a gradient concentration, thereby achieving
the effect of gradient inhibition, and comparing the diameter of the
inhibition zone and the growth state of the strain to confirm the
antibacterial activity. The filter paper was made into a circular
paper having a diameter of 5 mm by a puncher and then autoclaved.
The sterilized filter paper pieces were placed in the prepared drug
solution under aseptic conditions and one of them was impregnated
with methanol as a blank group. When they completely saturated, taken
out, and air-dried. The target bacteria were prepared into a 5 mm
diameter agar plate by a sterilized punch, and one piece was placed
in the center of the plate medium. Three pieces of air-dried filter
paper were evenly placed on the surface of the culture medium. Each
culture dish was numbered according to the different species and ratio
of agents. The culture dishes were placed in temperature humidity
chambers, and cultured under the conditions of a temperature of 28
°C
and a humidity of 70%. When the blank group of the culture dish was
covered with hyphae, the diameter of the mycelial growth or the inhibition
zone was measured by a vernier caliper and recorded the data. The
antibacterial standards are as follows: inhibition zone diameter >7
mm or hyphal growth diameter <25 mm, the target compound has an
antibacterial effect; inhibition zone diameter ≤7 mm or hyphal
growth diameter ≥25 mm, the target compound has no antibacterial
effect.

Preparation of the Microemulsion
The original agents are solid at room temperature. Therefore, suitable
solvents should be added to completely dissolve them in the preparation
of the microemulsion. This study used a phase inversion method. The
compounds were dissolved in the selected organic solvent in a compounding
ratio to form a uniform transparent oil phase. Then, an appropriate
amount of the emulsifier was added. Mix the emulsifier and the solution
uniformly at room temperature 25 °C and the stirring speed is
600 rpm. Under the condition of stirring, distilled water was added
dropwise to make the system gradually change from a water in oil type
to an oil in water type. After water was added to 100%, the mixture
was stirred for a suitable amount of time to prepare a homogeneous
and O/W type microemulsion.
