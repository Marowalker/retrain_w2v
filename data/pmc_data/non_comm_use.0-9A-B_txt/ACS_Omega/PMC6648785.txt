The lead-free 0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3–0.5Ba(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O3 (BCTZ)
ceramics with Er doping have shown good upconversion photoluminescence
(PL) and desirable optical temperature sensing properties. To bridge
a relationship between the structure/intrinsic defects and properties
of rare-earth-doped ferroelectrics, we designed and fabricated a series
of BCTZ ceramics doped with 1 mol % Er3+ by combining the
first-principles calculations and experimental measurements. Theoretically,
we discovered that Er can occupy both A sites (i.e., replacing Ba
or Ca) and B sites (i.e., replacing Ti or Zr) in the BCTZ lattice
and highlighted that the Er-doping-induced vacancy concentration decreases
for both the oxygen vacancies (Vo) and
cation vacancies (Vc). Experimentally,
the enhanced PL performance and the dielectric, ferroelectric, and
piezoelectric properties of the Er-doped BCTZ ceramics have been observed.
Finally, the physical origin of Er-induced property enhancement in
BCTZ has been elaborated according to the charge density and chemical
bonding analysis. These results open up a path to investigate the
effects of site substitution and vacancies on optoelectronic properties
of multifunctional rare-earth-doped ferroelectrics.

1 Introduction
Optoelectronic
multifunctional materials that own two or more properties
in a single entity have emerged as promising next-generation materials
for the development of digitization, integration, and miniaturized
equipment.1 Recently, rare-earth ions RE3+ (e.g., Pr3+, Er3+, Ho3+, La3+, Eu3+)-modified ferroelectrics, one
kind of multifunctional optoelectronic materials possessing both photoluminescence
(PL) and ferroelectric properties, have been intensively investigated
for the application of power generation, data storage, optical telecommunication,
and remote sensing.2−5 Among RE3+, Er3+ is an important activator
in upconversion luminescence materials, which are attractive in upconversion
lasers, planar waveguide, and bioseparation.6,7 Er-doped
ferroelectrics have been verified to be a promising candidate for
realizing multifunction; for instance, Er-doped CaBi4Ti4O15 and Er-doped (K, Na)NbO3 ceramics
exhibit bright upconversion emission and superior piezoelectric/ferroelectric
properties.1,8

A suitable host that matches well
with Er3+ is required
for Er-doped ferroelectrics to achieve excellent multifunctionality.
Traditional lead-based ferroelectric hosts cannot realize long-term
functionality with a view to protect environmental and human health.
Recently, a breakthrough was obtained by Liu and Ren in the lead-free
system, 0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3–0.5Ba(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O3 (BCTZ) ceramics, which possesses
an ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficient (d33 ≈ 620 pC/N) and is comparable to the lead-based (Pb, Zr)TiO3 piezoelectric ceramics.9 The distinctive
piezoelectric response of BCTZ originates from the coexistence of
multiphase near morphotropic phase boundary, such as rhombohedral–tetragonal
(R–T) phases or rhombohedral–orthonormal–tetragonal
phases.9,10 Besides, good upconversion PL and desirable
optical temperature sensing properties have been obtained in Er-doped
BCTZ ceramics for optical applications.11 However, the relationship between structure/intrinsic defects and
properties in BCTZ-based materials has not been explored thoroughly.

Furthermore, the PL properties of Er3+ in Er-doped ferroelectrics
are closely related to the crystal field, which is determined by the
crystal symmetry (phase structure) and chemical environment (e.g.,
point defects such as vacancies) of the host. However, Er3+ cannot substitute for a single site in BCTZ and the induced vacancies
are uncertain, increasing the complexity for studying the intrinsic
effect on properties.12 Additionally, density
functional theory (DFT) calculation is a powerful tool to explain
the microscopic mechanisms of spontaneous polarization, energetics,
and phase diagrams in ferroelectrics, which can be used to combine
with experimental results for elaborating the mechanism.13−15 The dominant native point defects in the ABO3 structure
are expected to be vacancies, which constantly influence the physical
properties, e.g., piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity.16 From this concern, a detailed understanding
of the effect of structure and vacancies on the optoelectronic properties
of Er-doped BCTZ is vital in extending the optoelectronic multifunctional
applications.

In this work, we designed a series of BCTZ ceramics
doped with
1 mol % Er3+, combining with solid-state reaction synthesis
and the first-principles calculations. The generated oxygen vacancies
(Vo) and cation vacancies (Vc) and the effect of vacancies on PL performance, dielectric,
ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics have been
further investigated. The physical origin of Er-induced changes in
PL, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of BCTZ has been unraveled
based on the first-principles calculations as well. The A-site doping
of Er in BCTZ brings local distortions along the ⟨001⟩
direction, resulting in dual-enhancement in PL and piezoelectric properties.

2 First-Principles Calculations and Experimental
Our
DFT calculations were performed by the GPU-accelerated Vienna
ab initio simulation package17,18 in conjunction with
the projector augmented wave generalized gradient approximations19 (GGAs) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof20 (PBE) pseudopotentials. The valence electron
configurations for Ba, Ca, Ti, Zr, Er, and O were 5s25p66s2, 3p64s2, 4s23d2, 4s24p65s24d2, 5p64f16s2, and 2s22p4, respectively. We used a 4 × 4 × 5 T phase
BCTZ supercell including 400 atoms and Γ symmetry K-point set for all of the calculations. The relaxation convergences
for ions and electrons were 1 × 10–5 and 1
× 10–6 eV, respectively, which were achieved
with the cutoff energy of 600 eV. The crystal structures and isosurfaces
were visualized by using the VESTA21 package.

In the experimental process, Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.9Zr0.1O3 substituted with x mol % (x = 1) Er3+ at A sites
(including Ba and Ca in the lattice) and B sites (including Ti and
Zr in the lattice) in BCTZ, i.e., Ba0.85–1.5xErxCa0.15Ti0.9Zr0.1O3 (substituting Ba by Er), Ba0.85Ca0.15–1.5xErxTi0.9Zr0.1O3 (substituting
Ca by Er), Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.9–xErxZr0.1O3–0.5x (substituting Ti by Er), and
Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.9Zr0.1–xErxO3–0.5x (substituting Zr by Er), were fabricated by the
conventional solid-state reaction technique. High-purity powders BaCO3 (99.95%), CaCO3 (99.99%), TiO2 (99.99%),
ZrO2 (99.99%), and Er2O3 (99.9%)
were used as the starting materials. The powders in the stoichiometric
ratio were ball-milled thoroughly in an alcohol by agate balls for
12 h and then dried and calcined at 1200 °C for 2 h in air before
second ball milling for 12 h. After sieving through an 80 mesh screen
and mixing with 5 wt % poly(vinyl alcohol) binder solution, the resulting
mixture was pressed into pellets, followed by burning out the binder
at 800 °C for 2 h. Finally, the disk samples were sintered at
1440 °C in air for 2 h to obtain ceramics. Before electrical
measurement, silver electrodes were coated on both surfaces of ceramics.
Then, the ceramics were poled under a 2 kV/mm electric field in silicone
oil at room temperature for 15 min.

The phase structure of ceramics
were checked using an X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analyzer (Rigaku Ultima III) with Cu Kα radiation. The
morphology of samples was investigated using a field-emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Supra 55). The piezoelectric coefficient d33 and polarization–electric field (P–E) loops of ceramics were measured
by a quasi-static piezoelectric meter (YE2730-A, Sinocera Piezotronics,
Inc.) and a ferroelectric test system (TF Analyzer 2000, aixACCT),
respectively. The room-temperature dielectric constant, εr, and dielectric loss, tan δ, at 10 kHz were
measured using an impedance analyzer (HP 4294 A, Agilent Technologies,
Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The Raman spectra were obtained using a grating
spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, HR800) equipped with a 488 nm-line
laser as the excitation source. The photoluminescence properties of
ceramics were recorded at room temperature by a 980 nm laser using
a spectrofluorometer (Ocean Optics USB4000).

3 Results
and Discussion
Our design principle was to optimize the thermodynamic
driving
force and find the favorable doping positions for Er in the BCTZ crystal
lattice. We also desire a deeper understanding of the relationship
between the Er dopant and induced intrinsic vacancies. Our DFT calculations
were based on a 4 × 4 × 5 supercell from the T-phase ABO3 unit cell by including the special quasi-random structure
(SQS) approach,22 which can closely mimic
the most relevant local pair and multisite correlation functions of
the random occupations. To represent the stoichiometric ratio of 0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3–0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3, the A-site atoms of our model includes
68 Ba atoms and 12 Ca atoms and the B-site atoms includes 72 Ti atoms
and 8 Zr atoms. Figure 1a illustrates the SQS structure of the BCTZ supercell. The fully
relaxed lattice parameters a and c are 4.034 and 4.087 Å, respectively. More details of the SQS
structure of the BCTZ supercell are presented in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 (a) SQS structure of the BCTZ 4 ×
4 × 5 supercell including
400 atoms. (b) Formation energy of Er-doped BCTZ with different Er-doping
sites.

To unravel the chemical driving
force of Er dopant in BCTZ, we
replaced one metallic cation site by one Er atom to achieve the 1.25%
Er-doping concentration. The formation energy, Ef, of the corresponding Er dopant is calculated as follows 1  where EtotalBCTZ and EtotalEr:BCTZ are the total energies of the pure and Er-doped BCTZ, respectively,
and μEr and μx are
the chemical potentials of solid ground-state Er and Ba/Ca/Ti/Zr,
respectively, and n = 1 for one Er dopant. Figure 1b presents the calculated
formation energy of Er-doped BCTZ with different Er-doping sites.
The negative value of the formation energy indicates that the Er-doping
process is an exothermic reaction for all of the cation sites. As
a result, the Er dopants can replace both A and B sites in BCTZ regardless
of designed site substitutions by Er. On the other hand, the formation
energy follows the sequence of ErZr > ErTi >
ErCa ≈ ErBa, suggesting that A-site doping
is more energetically favorable than B-site doping. Hence, we assume
that the Er dopant mainly occupies the A site by replacing the Ba
or Ca atoms and partly occupies the B site by replacing the Ti or
Zr atoms.

To get further understanding of the defects in BCTZ,
we predicted
the equilibrium defect concentrations, [D], based on the defect formation
energies, Hf, by23 2   3  where Nsites is
the number of sites per unit volume of BCTZ where the defects may
be present, KB and T are
the Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively, EdefectBCTZ and Eno-defectBCTZ are the total energies of BCTZ with and
without defects, respectively, and μd is the chemical
potential of solid ground-state defect matter.

Figure 2a shows
the Vo concentration in BCTZ under different
chemical environments. It is interesting to find that the Er doping
can significantly reduce the Vo concentration
in BCTZ. For instance, the Vo concentration
is about 2.0 × 1022 cm–3 for pure
BCTZ at 300 K, which reduces to less than 5.0 × 1021 cm–3 for Er-doped BCTZ regardless of the doping
sites. Considering the fact that the dipole polarization of BCTZ ceramics
is sensitive to the Vo concentration,
distinguished electrical properties of Er-doped BCTZ ceramics are
anticipated.

Figure 2 Concentration of various defects as a function of temperature
for
(a) Vo and (b)–(f) Vc in BCTZ.

On the other hand, Figure 2b illustrates the concentrations of different Vc (including VBa, VCa, VTi, and VZr) in BCTZ and Figure 2c–f illustrates the
corresponding
vacancies after Er doping. Some interesting conclusions can be obtained
herein: (1) the Vc concentration is much
lower than Vo in pure BCTZ. (2) The concentration
of A-site vacancies is much higher than that of B-site vacancies;
for instance, the concentrations of VBa and VCa are 1.3 × 1021 and 1.4 × 1021 cm–3 for pure BCTZ
at 300 K, respectively, whereas the concentrations of VTi and VZr are 8.9 × 1018 cm–3 and 1.0 × 1020 cm–3 for pure BCTZ
at 300 K, respectively. (3) The Er dopant at A site can only slightly
reduce the Vc concentration in BCTZ, while
the Er dopant at B site can significantly reduce the Vc concentration in BCTZ. All in all, the Er-doped BCTZ
ceramics include less vacancies than the pure BCTZ both in the oxygen
and cation sites. The computational results indicate that Er-doped
BCTZ deserved experimental investigations.

The ceramic samples
are abbreviated as BCTZ-Er-y (y =
0, Ba, Ca, Ti, or Zr), where y corresponds to different
synthesized chemical environments. Herein,
for y = 0, BaCO3, CaCO3, TiO2, and ZrO2 follow the stoichiometric ratio of BCTZ
(i.e., 0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3–0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 or Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.9Zr0.1O3) without
adding any Er2O3. For y = Ba/Ca/Ti/Zr,
we included 0.5% molar concentration Er2O3 and
reduced 1% molar concentration BaCO3/CaCO3/TiO2/ZrO2 in the stoichiometric ratio of BCTZ, respectively.

The XRD patterns of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics are
shown in Figure 3a.
All of the obtained ceramics possess perovskite structure, and there
is no trace of secondary phases. T phase is dominant in the ceramics,
which can be evidenced by the splitting of the (001)/(100) and (002)/(200)
peaks (Figure 3b,d).24 Compared with the pure BCTZ (i.e., y = 0), the splitting of these diffraction peaks become more obvious
after introducing Er3+, suggesting that the content of
T phase increases in BCTZ-Er-y ceramics. It is interesting
to note that our designed chemical environment is not directly related
to the doping site of Er3+. The (111) diffraction peaks
around 38.8° of the ceramics with y = Ti and
Zr (Figure 3c) shift
toward higher angles compared to those with y = 0.
That should be attributed to the substitution of A-site ions Ba2+ (0.161 nm, coordination number CN = 12) and Ca2+ (0.134 nm, CN = 12) with smaller Er3+ (0.122 nm, CN =
12), resulting in lattice shrinkage and simultaneous generation of Vc. While for the ceramics with y = Ba and y = Ca, some Er3+ substitute
for the A site (similar to y = Ti and y = Zr) but other Er3+ (0.089 nm, CN = 6) incorporate into
smaller B-site ions, i.e., Ti4+ (0.0605 nm, CN = 6) and
Zr4+ (0.072 nm, CN = 6), leading to lattice expansion and
producing Vo. No notable shift of the
(111) diffraction peak can be observed in BCTZ-Er-Ca (Figure 3c), indicating that both A
and B sites have been occupied by Er3+ and the amounts
of individual replacement are close.

Figure 3 (a) XRD patterns of BCTZ-Er-y ceramics and (b–d)
zoomed XRD patterns at 2θ of 22.2°, 38.8°, 45.2°,
respectively.

To further investigate
the lattice parameters of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics,
a general diffraction analysis program was performed
using the Rietveld method by considering the P4mm space group of BaTiO3 (Figure S1). According to the designed chemical formula, Ba
was replaced by Ca and Ti was replaced by Zr for the refinements. Table S1 gives the refined structural parameters,
i.e., lattice parameters (a, b, c, and β), calculated tetragonality ratio (c/a), as well as the reliability factors
(Rwp) and goodness-of-fit indicators (S). The low Rwp (<15%) and S (<2) values manifest good fits between the observed
and calculated patterns. Comparing to the DFT data, we found that
the experimental measured data are slightly smaller than the computational
predicted ones. This is due to the fact that GGA-PBE pseudopotential
always overestimates the lattice parameters.25 It is worth noting that the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics
show lower Rwp values than pure BCTZ ceramics,
indicating that Er doping do reduce the concentration of oxygen vacancies
or cation vacancies in BCTZ. As given in Table S1, the lattice parameters (a, b, and c) of BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ti, Zr) are smaller than those of BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ba, Ca), suggesting that more Er3+ substitute for the A site at y = Ti and y = Zr. Compared to those of pure BCTZ (y = 0), the c/a values of BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ba, Ca, Ti, Zr) are all larger because
their T phases are predominant.

The Raman spectra of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics are
shown in Figure 4.
It is known that the cubic BaTiO3 owns 15 degrees of freedom
for vibration, consisting of triply degenerate acoustic mode (one
F1u) and optical modes (three F1u and one F2u).26 While in the tetragonal BaTiO3, owing to the polarization between Ti4+ and O2–, the F1u mode splits into three A1 modes and three E modes, and the F2u mode splits
into B1 and E mode. Thus, the Raman-active optical lattice
vibration of T-phase BaTiO3 can be expressed as 3A1 + B1 + 4E.27 Furthermore,
A1 and E optical modes are separated into transversal (TO)
and longitudinal (LO) components because of long-range electrostatic
forces from the ions in crystal lattice.26 The Raman bands (Figure 4) at 232, 518, 293, and 721 cm–1 confirm
that T phase is dominating in the ceramics,28 which is in consistent with the XRD results. The bands at 232 and
518 cm–1 correspond to A1(TO) character
and the 232 cm–1 one is especially related to polar
Ti–O vibration. These very similar peaks of all our samples
confirm the stability of the T phase. On the other hand, the bands
at 293 cm–1 (B1 and E(TO + LO) modes)
are assigned to the asymmetry within the [TiO6]/[ZrO6] octahedral and the bands at 721 cm–1 (mixing
with A1 and E modes) are designated to the bending or stretching
of [TiO6]/[ZrO6] octahedral in the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics.29,30 We found that after doping with
Er these two bands become broader with weaker intensities, indicating
that Er doping may reduce the integrity and symmetry in BCTZ ceramics.

Figure 4 Raman
spectra of BCTZ-Er-y ceramics.

Figure 5 shows
the
surface morphologies of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics. All
of the specimens exhibit dense microstructures with the relative densities
of > 95% (as given in Table 1) and the mean grain sizes of 21.38 μm (y = 0), 7.33 μm (y = Ba), 6.77 μm (y = Ca), 8.88 μm (y = Ti), and 7.52
μm (y = Zr). It is interesting to find that
the grain size decreases after the inclusion of the Er dopant into
the BCTZ ceramics. Based on our calculation, Er3+ ions
preferentially occupy the A site by substituting for Ba2+ or Ca2+ regardless of designed replacing sites for Er3+; thus, the donor-type nature of Er3+ in BCTZ
will be expressed. Then, the donor-doping ions induced vacancies concentrate
near the grain boundaries, hindering their mobility during densification
and ultimately inhibiting the grain growth of ceramics.31 More importantly, Er doping is propitious to
increasing the relative density of the BCTZ ceramics. For instance,
the relative density of pure BCTZ (for y = 0) is
95.76%, which increases to the highest value of 97.69% for y = Ti. Higher relative densities indicate lower concentration
of vacancies after Er doping, which agrees well with our calculation
and XRD results. Compared to those in BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ba, Ca) ceramics, the BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ti, Zr) ones possess less pores with higher relative
densities, suggesting that the BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ti, Zr) samples may exhibit better properties. To confirm
the existence and distribution of Ba, Ca, Ti, Zr, Er, and O elements,
elemental mappings are performed for the ceramics (Figure S2), testifying that all of the elements are homogeneously
distributed in the BCTZ host.

Figure 6 shows the
temperature dependence of dielectric properties of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics. For pure BCTZ, two dielectric anomalies centered
at approximately 48 and 95 °C can be detected, corresponding
to the rhombohedral–tetragonal and tetragonal-cubic phase transition
temperatures (TR–T and Tc), respectively. As the two dielectric peaks
diffuse, phase transitions in pure BCTZ take place in a temperature
range rather than a fixed temperature. It is possible that R and T
phases coexist at room temperature as the first central phase transition
temperature (i.e., 48 °C) is close to room temperature, whereas
for the Er-doped BCTZ ceramics, only one dielectric anomaly (corresponding
to Tc) can be observed at 96, 97, 86,
and 91 °C for y = Ba, Ca, Ti, and Zr, respectively,
manifesting that only tetragonal phase exists at room temperature.
The results are consistent with the XRD analysis. In addition, vacancies
in the dielectric ceramics can influence Tc; for instance, Tc decreases after the
introduction of Vc.32,33 Hence, compared with the ceramics with y = 0, Ba,
and Ca, the Vc concentrations of ceramics
with y = Ti and y = Zr are higher
and the effect on reducing Tc is dominant.

Figure 6 Temperature
dependence of dielectric properties of BCTZ-Er-y ceramics.

The PL properties of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics were
examined, as shown in Figure 7. The upconversion PL emission spectra (Figure 7a) manifest that under the excitation of
980 nm there are two strong green emission bands and one weak red
emission band locating at ∼522, 550, and 667 nm, resulting
from the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. A clear splitting
of emission peaks can be observed, ascribed to the Stark splitting
of the degenerate 4f levels of Er3+ under strong crystal
field,34 which is affected by the interaction
between Er3+ and the BCTZ host. The PL intensities of BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ba, Ca) are weaker than those of
BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ti, Zr). It is known
that the emission of Er3+ in luminescent materials can
be quenched by a small amount of Vo because
the positive charge of Vo can trap the
excited electrons to reduce the photons used for radiative emission.35 On the other hand, structural symmetry and density
of ceramics play an important role in the PL intensity. Compared to
those of BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ba, Ca),
BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ti, Zr) exhibit lower
symmetries (slightly higher c/a values
as listed in Table S1), higher relative
densities (Table 1),
and fine grains, contributing to the enhancement of PL intensities.

Figure 7 (a) Upconversion
PL spectra of BCTZ-Er-y ceramics.
(b) Schematic diagram for the upconversion mechanism of Er3+ under the excitation of 980 nm. (c)–(e) PL decay curves monitoring
the emissions at (c) 522 nm, (d) 550 nm, and (e) 667 nm.

The decay curves from the upconversion emissions
at 522 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2), 550
nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2), and 667 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics are shown
in Figure 7c–e.
Because of the energy transfer during the upconversion process, the
decay exhibits slight nonexponential curves, which can be fitted by
the following equation 4  where I(t) represents the PL intensity at a time t after
the cutoff of 980 nm excitation and τ is the PL lifetime. For
the two green emission bands at 522 and 550 nm, the calculated lifetimes
of the ceramics are all close to 130 μs (Figure 7c,d), indicating that upconversion green
emission bands are almost independent of host symmetry and internal
defects. However, the vacancies in the ceramics significantly influence
the PL lifetime of red emission at 667 nm. It is reported that in
Er-doped perovskite titanate Vo in the
material can greatly reduce the PL lifetime.36 Therefore, the ceramics with y = Ba and Ca that
contain more Vo have shorter lifetimes
than those of y = Ti and Zr (Figure 7e). Among them, the lifetime of red emission
of BCTZ-Er-Zr is the longest (76 μs). Cation vacancies, Vc, acting as a nonradiative recombination center,37,38 can increase the probability of cross relaxation (CR) and then decrease
the PL lifetime. Nevertheless, the effect of Vc on CR of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics is unobvious
because the concentration of Er3+ is low (only 1 mol %).

For further studying the vacancy effect on PL intensity and lifetime,
the upconversion PL mechanism is requisite to be discussed based on
the energy-level diagram of Er3+, as shown in Figure 7b. Under the excitation
of 980 nm, Er3+ can populate the 4F7/2 level via the ground-state absorption (GSA) and excited-state absorption
(ESA). Then, multiphonon relaxation occurs and Er3+ ions
relax nonradiatively to 2H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2 levels subsequently,
producing the green 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and red 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emission spectra.
The energy level of Vo should reside above
the 4I11/2 level of Er3+, which is
similar to that in Er-doped 0.93Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–0.07BaTiO3.39 In the ceramics with y = Ba and Ca, more Vo can trap excited electrons used for ESA and
radiative emissions during the upconversion process, thus reducing
the populations of the 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2 levels and then decreasing the green and red emission spectra (Figure 7a). Also, the presence
of Vo would induce new energy levels above 4I11/2 to enhance the nonradiative energy transfer,36 decreasing the population of the 4F9/2 level (close to the Vo levels) and then the PL lifetimes at 667 nm.

The ferroelectric P–E hysteresis
loops of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics are shown in Figure 8. The pure BCTZ exhibits
a slim loop with a large remanent polarization (Pr = 13.8 μC/cm2) and a low coercive field
(Ec = 0.98 kV/mm), as listed in Table 2. Due to the disruption
of long-range ferroelectric order40 induced
by Er doping and the inhibition of domain-wall movement in smaller
grains (Figure 5),41 the ferroelectric properties of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics exhibit deterioration with smaller Pr and larger Ec. In addition,
Er doping significantly affects the piezoelectric performance of the
ceramics. The BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ti,
Zr) ceramics possess larger d33 (372 and
330 pC/N) than that of pure BCTZ (d33 =
270 pC/N), while the BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ba, Ca) ones have smallest d33 (Table 2). The ferroelectric
and piezoelectric properties are partly related to vacancies such
as Vo and Vc.42 In BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ba, Ca), more Vo (compared
to y = Ti/Zr) can act as space charge to cause strong
domain pinning,43 resulting in increasing Ec and decreasing d33, whereas in BCTZ-Er-y (y = Ti,
Zr), abundant Vc can compensate charge
disorder and make the domain motion easier, benefiting in enhancing d33.44,45 The ceramics owning
better piezoelectric performance usually possess denser microstructures
and higher relative densities. Therefore, the variation tendencies
of electrical properties coincide with the SEM analysis (Table 1).

BCTZ-Er-y ceramics.

First-principles calculations were performed to further
unravel
the physical origin of the improved PL and piezoelectric properties
of the BCTZ-Er-y ceramics. First, we plotted the
total and partial radial distribute function (RDF) for pure BCTZ from
our SQS model in Figures S3 and 9a, respectively. The long-range order feature in
the SQS model is well represented. More importantly, it is interesting
to find that the first RDF peak is contributed by the nearest-neighbored
B–O (Ti–O and Zr–O) pair and the second RDF peak
is contributed by the nearest-neighbored A–O (Ba–O and
Ca–O) pair. Figure 9b further illustrates the cation–O interatomic distances
in pure BCTZ. We found that the A-site cation and O are bonded around
2.8–2.9 Å, whereas the B-site cation and O are bonded
around 1.9–2.1 Å. Herein, the Ti–O (or Ca–O)
bonds are distributed in a wider range than the Zr–O (or Ba–O)
bonds. It is understandable because the A-site cations own larger
ionic radii than the B-site cations. Figure 9b presents the Er–O interatomic distances
for different doping sites in Er-doped BCTZ. The A-site and B-site
doping show quite different Er–O interatomic distance distributions.
For the A-site doping cases, both the ErBa–O and
ErCa–O interatomic distances distribute in a very
wide range from 2.1 to 3.6 Å. It is interesting to find that
the ErBa–O interatomic distances can be divided
to three groups: the B-site-O-like bonding states around 2.25 Å,
the A-site-O-like bonding states around 2.8–3.0 Å, and
no bonding states around 3.4–3.6 Å. For the B-site doping
cases, all of the ErTi–O and ErZr–O
interatomic distances distribute in very narrow range around 2.2 Å.
For a deeper understanding of the cation–O bonding features,
we studied the charge transfer from the cation atom to the surrounding
O atoms by analyzing the charge density differences, ρdiff, in Figure 10, which
are obtained using 5  where ρscf and ρnscf correspond to the self-consistent and
non-self-consistent
charge densities, respectively. The violet isosurfaces denote the
charge accumulation (ρdiff > 0), and the cyan
isosurfaces
indicate the charge depletion (ρdiff < 0). According
to Figure 10a, in
pure BCTZ, hexahedron charge depletions of the B-site cations are
vividly shown, resulting from the [TiO6]/[ZrO6] octahedrons in the BCTZ crystal framework. The B-site-O bonds (Ti–O
and Zr–O bonds) along the ⟨100⟩ and ⟨010⟩
directions and the Zr–O bonds along the ⟨001⟩
direction can be distinguished by the noticeable charge accumulations
at the Ti–O/Zr–O bond center between Ti/Zr and O. Meanwhile,
the alternative set of remarkable and negligible charge accumulations
of the Ti–O–Ti bonds along the ⟨001⟩ direction
show typical alternatively strong and weak Ti–O bond features.
Such bonding features explain why we have got the wider Ti–O
bond length distribution than Zr–O, as shown in Figure 10a. However, there is no noticeable
charge accumulation between the A-site cation (Ba or Ca) and O, indicating
that the direct interactions between Ba/Ca and O are very weak in
BCTZ. As the A-site cations locate at the center of the octahedral
void among the [TiO6]/[ZrO6] octahedral crystal
framework, the crystal field effect are from the interaction between
the Ba/Ca atom and [TiO6]/[ZrO6] octahedrons.
As shown in Figure 10b, the ErBa dopant shifts up from the center of the octahedral
void along the ⟨001⟩ direction. As a result, one Er
cation will be strongly bonded to four O anions with remarkable charge
accumulations at the Er–O bond center between Er and O. Herein,
direct interactions between Er and O can be verified. On the other
hand, there is no noticeable charge accumulation between Er and the
other eight nearest O anions. The coexistence of both strong and weak
Er–O interactions will lead to local distortions along the
⟨001⟩ direction in BCTZ. In Figure 10c, we found that the ErZr dopant
plays a very similar role to the Zr cation in BCTZ, where all of the
Er–O bonds can be distinguished by the noticeable charge accumulations.
To conclude, the A-site doping of Er in BCTZ results in local distortions
along the ⟨001⟩ direction, which not only increases
the c/a ratio of BCTZ (Table S1) but also increases the PL and piezoelectric
properties. Hence, higher PL intensities and larger d33 of the ceramics with y = Ti and Zr
(compared to y = Ba and Ca) are consistent with our
calculations.

A deeper understanding on the chemical bonding nature of
Er-doped
BCTZ can be gained by analyzing the electron localization function
(ELF),46 which can give a rather quantitative
picture on the chemical bonding of compounds. The ELF contours on
the (101) plane for pure BCTZ are shown in Figure 11a,b, which give the clear pictures of typical
ionic bonding feature of BCTZ by the strong spherical shaped localized
electrons around the O atoms. On the other hand, the localized electron
states around the Ba and Zr atoms come from the inner-level 5s25p6 and 4s24p6 electrons,
respectively. To further understand the chemical bonding characters
of BCTZ, we studied the bond point of the cation–O bond by
the one-dimensional (1D) line plots of ELF, as marked in the figures.
Herein, the bond point is the saddle point in the electron charge
with two negative eigenvalues and one positive eigenvalue of the Hessian
matrix of ELF.47 The minimum ELF value
in the middle of the curve corresponds to the bond point, and larger
bond point value corresponds to the stronger bond interactions.48 Although we cannot get the bond point for Ti–O,
since there are no localized electrons around the Ti atoms, we can
still find that the B-site-cation–O bonds are stronger than
the A-site-cation–O bonds. The results agree well with our
previous analysis about bond length and charge density difference.
As seen from Figure 11c,d, after Er doping, the bond points for ErBa–O1 and ErZr–O are 0.20 and 0.18, respectively.
These values are very close to the Zr–O bond point in BCTZ,
indicating that the Er–O bonds show very similar feature to
the Zr–O bond. It is worth noting that the long ErBa–O1 bond and short ErBa–O2 bond exhibit significant differences, which is the chemical
bonding origin of Er-induced local distortions along the ⟨001⟩
direction we have shown previously.

plots of ELF in (a), (b)
pure BCTZ, (c) ErBa-doped BCTZ, and (d) ErZr-doped BCTZ. All of the graphs are under the same saturation levels,
and the interval between the contour lines is 0.15. The color scale
for the ELF value is given at the bottom right of the figure.

4 Conclusions
Aiming
to understand the effect of structure and vacancies on the
optoelectronic properties of Er-doped BCTZ, we designed and prepared
1 mol % Er-doped BCTZ ceramics by the solid-state method. Our DFT
calculations manifest that Er mainly occupies the A site (replacing
Ba or Ca) and partly occupies the B site (replacing Ti or Zr) in BCTZ,
generating both Vc and Vo. Compared to those of pure BCTZ, Er-doped BCTZ include
less vacancies. The experimental results show that tetragonal phase
is dominant in the ceramics. Er doping can reduce the crystal symmetry
(increase the c/a ratio), inhibit
the grain growth, increase the density, vary the Curie temperature,
regulate the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, and endow
the BCTZ ceramics with the upconversion PL feature. Furthermore, the
properties of Er-doped BCTZ strongly depend on the concentrations
of Vc and Vo. The ceramics with more Vo exhibit lower
upconversion emission intensities, shorter lifetimes of red emission,
and smaller Pr, whereas the ceramics with
more Vc possess higher emission intensities,
longer PL lifetimes at 667 nm, lower Tc, and much higher d33 (reach up to 372
pC/N). The first-principles calculations unravel that chemical bonding
characters are distinct for Er-doped BCTZ with various site substitutions
of Er. The A-site doping of Er in BCTZ brings local distortions along
the ⟨001⟩ direction, resulting in increasing the PL
intensity and d33. This work provides
evidence that the optoelectronic properties of Er-doped BCTZ ceramics
are closely related to the structure and intrinsic vacancies.
