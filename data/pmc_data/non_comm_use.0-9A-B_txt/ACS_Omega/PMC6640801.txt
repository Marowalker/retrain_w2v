Aromatic ionomers
with perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid groups for
fuel cell applications have been prepared mostly by the post-functionalization
method. Herein, we present a direct polymerization method using a
novel monomer with a perfluorosulfonic acid group to control the amount
and position of the sulfonic acid groups. A poly(p-phenylene)-based aromatic hydrocarbon ionomer bearing a pendant
perfluorosulfonic acid group in a substituent at the 2-position is synthesized by Ni(0)-catalyzed
coupling polymerization. The direct polymerization provides Mn values of up to 169 000 with a highly
controlled molecular structure and allows the formation of thin membranes.
These ionomers were found to combine the positive features of perfluorinated
and aromatic hydrocarbon ionomers, and these thin membranes with a
relatively high ion exchange capacity showed high proton conductivity
and excellent fuel cell performance (907 mW cm–2 even at 80 °C and 30% RH) under low humidity conditions compared
with other reported aromatic hydrocarbon ionomers.

==== Body
Introduction
Polymer exchange membrane
fuel cells (PEMFCs) are expected to be
a key technology for solving the current problems with zero-emission
vehicles. Perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers such as Nafion are the most
promising ionomers for use in PEMFCs because of their high proton
conductivities and chemical stabilities. However, the practical use
of such polymers is limited by their high costs, relatively low glass
transition temperatures, and high gas permeabilities. These issues
have stimulated the development of alternative polymer electrolyte
membranes over the past decade, with particular interest in acid-functionalized
aromatic hydrocarbon ionomers.1−3 For typical aromatic ionomers,
aryl or alkyl sulfonic acid groups are densely introduced on either
the main chains or the side chains of polymers to achieve high proton
conductivities.4−8

Among the aromatic ionomers, poly(phenylene)s have been attractive
candidates for polymer electrolyte membranes because of their high
chemical stability due to the large aromatic C–C bond dissociation
energy.9−12 Our previous studies demonstrated that sulfonated poly(4-phenoxybenzoyl-1,4-phenylene)
(SPP) exhibited excellent proton conductivity, chemical
stability, and mechanical properties.13,14 On the other
hand, the conductivities of these ionomers are lower than those of
perfluorinated ionomers under high temperature and low humidity conditions
because the aryl sulfonic acid groups have lower acidities than superacid
groups such as perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid.

Recently, some
groups have demonstrated that aromatic ionomers
with perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid groups can lead to improved proton
conductivities under low humidity conditions without increasing the
ion exchange capacity (IEC).15,16 These reports are limited
to poly(arylene ether)s,17−23 and there have been no reports on poly(phenylene)s with the exception
of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid-functionalized poly(phenylene)s with
low levels of sulfonation, as prepared by the post-functionalization
method.24 Because the post-functionalization
of parent polymers is a complicated method for attaching superacid
groups, it is poor at controlling the amount and position of the sulfonic
acid groups. Use of monomers that have been prefunctionalized with
superacid groups allows the synthesis of ionomers with well-controlled
structures.

Here, we demonstrate the first direct synthesis
of poly(phenylene)-based
ionomers having perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid groups from a functionalized
monomer via a Ni(0)-catalyzed coupling polymerization. This process
enables the synthesis of ionomers with aromatic backbones without
other linkages and with a high density of superacid groups on the
flexible side chains, which provides high chemical stability and high
proton conductivity.

Results and Discussion
The monomer
used for the synthesis of the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic
acid-functionalized poly(phenylene) ionomer was prepared by the reaction
of sodium 2-(4-(4′-2,5-dichlorobenzoyl)phenoxyphenoxy) tetrafluoroethane
sulfinate with N-chlorosuccinimide to form the sulfonyl
chloride, followed by esterification. Because the acidic protons and
even cation salt forms of the perfluorosulfonic acid groups inhibit
the polymerization,25 the sulfonic acid
groups of the monomers required protection to produce high molecular
weight polymers. The esterification reaction was carried out using
3,5-dimethylphenol, phenol, or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol as protecting
groups for the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid but not using 2,2-dimethyl-1-propanol,
which is the appropriate protecting group used for SPP. The chosen alcohols and phenols have relatively high acidities,
making them suitable protecting agents. Ni(0)-catalyzed coupling polymerization
was carried out using our previously reported method.13,14 High molecular weightFPP (Mn = 147 000 g mol–1 and Mw/Mn = 1.96) was obtained only when 3,5-dimethylphenyl groups
were used as the protecting groups in the monomer. Poly(4-phenoxybenzoyl-1,4-phenylene)
with 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoro-2-oxyethane-1-sulfonic acid, SFPP, was synthesized by deprotection and subsequent acidification, as
shown in Scheme 1.
After the Ni(0)-catalyzed coupling polymerization, around 20% of the
protecting groups were detached from FPP, as determined
using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 3,5-dimethylphenyl groups
of FPP were fully cleaved using sodium hydroxide and
subsequent acidic hydrolysis to afford SFPP. The deprotection
was also confirmed using 19F NMR of SFPP,
which showed that chemical shifts related to −CF2CF2SO3R at −83.7 ppm and −115
ppm were eliminated (Figure S8). SFPP was soluble in aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylformamide
(DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and N-methylpyrrolidone
(NMP). For comparison, SPP was also prepared by the Ni(0)-catalyzed
coupling polymerization. The Mn values
of SFPP and SPP as estimated by gel permeation
chromatography based on polystyrene standards using DMF as an eluant
were 169 000 and 180 000 g mol–1,
respectively (Figure S9). Polymer membranes
were prepared using a solution casting method from DMSO solutions.
The weight-based IEC (IECw) values, as determined by back-titration,
for the SFPP and SPP membranes were 2.13
and 2.86 meq g–1, respectively, which were consistent
with the theoretical values. It is noteworthy that SFPP and SPP have higher water resistance even with relatively
high IECw than other aromatic hydrocarbon ionomers with
superacid groups.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Poly(phenylene) with Perfluoroalkyl Sulfonic
Acid Group, SFPP
The humidity dependence of the number of water molecules
per sulfonic
acid group (λ: [H2O][SO3H]−1) and the in-plane proton conductivities of SFPP, SPP, and Nafion membranes at 80 °C are shown in Figure 1. The λ values
of all of the polymer membranes increased with increasing relative
humidity (RH). The λvalue of SFPP was 3.7 at 30%
RH and 11.2 at 90% RH, both of which were higher than those of SPP (λ = 3.0 at 30% RH and 10.3 at 90% RH). Above 60%
RH, the in-plane conductivities of the SFPP and SPP membranes were higher than that of the Nafion NR-211 membrane
(IECw = 0.91 meq g–1). At 30% RH, SFPP membranes exhibited a conductivity of 7.95 mS cm–1, which was higher than that of the SPP membrane (4.50 mS cm–1) but comparable to that
of Nafion NR-211. Although the IECw values of the membranes
affected the conductivities under high humidity conditions, the degree
of acidity had a larger effect on the proton transport under low humidity
conditions. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of water in these
membranes (DNMR) was determined by pulsed
field gradient NMR26 at 30 °C (Figure S10). These data also showed similar humidity
dependences, indicating that SFPP had a high carrier
density and/or a more effective structure for proton and water transport
under a wide range of humidity conditions.

Figure 1 Humidity dependences
of the number of absorbed water molecules
per sulfonic acid group (left) and in-plane conductivities (right)
of SFPP, SPP, and Nafion NR-211 membranes
at 80 °C.

To investigate the morphology
of the SFPP membranes,
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was performed using a synchrotron
beam line in Photon Factory of KEK. The SAXS profile of a dry SFPP membrane showed a diffraction peak at q = 1.9 nm–1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.3 nm. Yoshimura and Iwasaki reported that a dry Nafion
membrane showed a diffraction peak that indicated the size of the
ion cluster channel as 3.3 nm.27 On the
other hand, no peak was observed for most poly(arylene ether sulfone)s
with perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid and SPP membranes due
to a lower level of phase-separation. In the case of the SFPP membrane, the high density of the acid groups could produce distinct
ion channels, resulting in high proton conductivities under low humidity
conditions (Figure S11).

The H2 and O2 permeability coefficients of
the polymer membranes were measured as a function of RH at 80 °C
(Figure 2). The gas
permeability coefficients of the SFPP, SPP, and Nafion membranes increased with increasing RH. This was possibly
due to the plasticizing effect of water, which caused H2 and O2 to pass easily through the membranes.28 While
poly(arylene ether)s containing perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid groups
showed almost the same gas permeability coefficients as Nafion at
80 °C under dry conditions,29 the
gas permeability coefficients of SFPP and SPP were lower than that of Nafion between 10 and 90% RH. The gas permeability
coefficient of the SFPP membrane was higher than that
of the SPP membrane. This could be related to the strong
interactions between the poly(p-phenylene) backbones,
which would reduce the gas diffusivity, and reduced interactions between
the linear fluoroalkyl chains of SFPP, which could enhance
the gas diffusivity.30,31

and oxygen (right) permeability
coefficients of SFPP, SPP, and Nafion NR-211
membranes at 80 °C.

We investigated the fuel cell performances of SFPP membranes that were thinner than previously reported aromatic ionomer
membranes with perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid groups (thicknesses of
18 μm and 40–125 μm, respectively)29,32 to show the effects of the superacidic groups on fuel cell performance.
In other words, the SFPP membranes had good mechanical
properties to allow fabrication of thin membranes and fuel cell performance
tests. Indeed, the tensile strength and elongation break values of SFPP at 30 °C and 90% RH were 10 MPa and 11%, respectively,
which were higher than those of SPP (tensile strength
= 4 MPa, elongation break = 5%). Figure 3 shows the fuel cell polarization and power
density curves of a SFPP membrane electrode assembly
(MEA) at 80 °C, 90% RH or 30% RH, and 0.1 MPaG for both electrodes.
The SFPP MEA showed high open circuit voltages of 0.98
V at 90% RH and 0.99 V at 30% RH because of the low gas permeability
of SFPP. The maximum power density (Wmax) was 976 mW cm–2 at 90% RH and remained
at 907 mW cm–2 even at 30% RH, showing superior
performance to that of Nafion NR-211 (Wmax = 803 mW cm–2 at 80 °C and 30% RH, thickness
25 μm). The excellent performance and low humidity dependence
were due not only to the high proton conductivity but also to the
relatively good mechanical properties.

power density curves for a H2 (500 mL min–1, 0.1 MPaG)/air (1000 mL min–1, 0.1 MPaG) fuel
cell using a SFPP membrane

at 30% RH and 90% RH for both electrodes.

Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized a novel poly(phenylene)
with perfluoroalkyl
sulfonic acid groups via a Ni(0)-catalyzed coupling polymerization.
The SFPP membranes showed high proton conductivity under
low humidity conditions that was comparable to Nafion 211 membranes.
Although the H2 and O2 permeability coefficients
of SFPP and SPP were lower than that of
Nafion 211 membranes between 10 and 90% RH, SFPP membranes
showed relatively higher gas permeability than SPP membranes.
We demonstrated that SFPP MEAs displayed an excellent
performance with low humidity dependence. The introduction of perfluoroalkyl
sulfonic acid groups and synthetic strategies without post functionalization
provided positive effects on the poly(p-phenylene)-based
aromatic hydrocarbon ionomer. Further investigations of the block
copolymers are underway to provide improvements to the polymer morphology,
proton transport, mechanical properties, and stability.
