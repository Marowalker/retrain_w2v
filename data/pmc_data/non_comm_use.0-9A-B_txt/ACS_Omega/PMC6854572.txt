To
facilitate cell sheet formation of human dermal fibroblasts,
gelatin moieties were chemically decorated onto the surface of electrospun
nanofibrils (NFs). Poly(caprolactone) [PCL] was electrospun onto fibrous
meshes and then fragmented into nanofibrils by optimized milling and
hydrolysis. After aminolysis of the NFs, methacrylated gelatin (GelMA)
was reacted via Michael-type addition with the surface-exposed amines
of the aminolyzed NFs (ahPCL NFs). GelMA was immobilized on the ahPCL
NFs. Analysis of ahPCL NFs and native NFs conducted using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy confirmed that gelatin was chemically conjugated onto
the NFs. Human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and the decorated NFs were
self-assembled into cell sheets, and cells in the matrix showed highly
spreading morphology by confocal microscopy. Our results indicate
that the degree of cell spreading and cellular viability was much
higher in the presence of GelMA immobilized in ahPCL NFs.

Introduction
Three-dimensional (3D)
cell culture has recently been used in cell
sheet engineering, drug discovery, and cell-based biosensor development
because cells in a 3D culture system show behaviors similar to those
shown by cells in living organisms.1−4 The development of 3D culture methods to
replace two-dimensional cell culture on film surfaces has been a major
goal in the research community.5 These
methods include the use of scaffolds, hydrogels,6−8 electrospinning,9−12 and temperature-sensitive polymers.13,14

The
advantages of electrospinning include straightforward implementation,
conditions similar to those of an extracellular matrix (ECM), a high
surface-area-to-volume ratio, topographical cues, a rapid exchange
of nutrients and waste, and low inflammatory response upon implantation.15−17 In hydrogels, cells exhibit a round appearance and do not stretch.
In nanofibers that possess topographic features, cells are stretched
and show proliferative behavior.18 Similarly,
fibroblasts in hydrogels do not behave properly and assume a round
shape, but actin stretches effectively in a composite containing nanofibrils
(NFs). Hydrogels containing a higher content of NFs result in more
distinct topographic effects on cells grown in these scaffolds. The
higher the content, the greater the effect due to their topographic
effect on cells in hydrogels.19 In a previous
study, we used coaxial electrospinning to synthesize hydrophilic PCL/AL@NF
containing hydrophobic polymer poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and hydrophilic
alginate (AL) in the outer layer and core, respectively, which allows
two immiscible solvents to be electrospun.20 In this reaction, the calcium bridge in alginate was dependent on
the concentration of calcium in the solution. Topographic features
of the nanofibers become distinct at high temperatures, and our results
showed increased cellular infiltration. Moreover, because cell infiltration
is difficult to allow in dense nanofibers,21 in the present study, we fragmented our NFs via hydrolysis.22

Hydrophobic polymers are used to produce
nanofibers in conventional
electrospinning. This is because electrospinning using an organic
solvent is more advantageous than using an aqueous phase for obtaining
polymerization. Among these, polyesters, such as polylactic acid (PLA)–polyglycolic
acid (PGA) and poly(caprolactone) (PCL), have been used extensively
in fibrous meshes because these polymers possess excellent biocompatibility
and processing properties and are biodegradable.23−25 However, these
materials do not swell, and are hydrophobic and rigid, which limits
cell migration and proliferation. To overcome these issues, we previously
prepared fragmented electrospun PCL nanofibers and surface-decorated
the matrix with cationic and hydrophilic polymeric brushes to sequester
multiple proteins.22 The adsorbed proteins
in the decorated matrix exerted bioactive effects, which does not
occur in a nondecorated matrix. With an aim to decorate the nanofiber
with hydrophilic polymers, we also prepared electrospun nanofibers
composed of a PCL–poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) copolymer and PEG
chains were chemically conjugated to the surface-exposed amines.26 However, the surface density of the amines were
relatively low, which caused insufficient decoration of PEG on the
surfaces.

Several studies have shown that aminolysis reduces
synthesis complexity
and increases the number of topographical cues on the film surface.
Deschrevel et al. used atomic force microscope to show that roughness
of a PLA film surface increases with increasing concentration of 1,6-hexanediamine
solution, or with duration of aminolysis.27 Aminolysis removes the ester bonds present in polyester and exposes
the amine groups on polyester surface as amide bonds are formed.28 Various biomolecules have been used to alter
the properties of polymer surfaces. The widely used gelatin contains
a peptide related to cell adhesion (arginine–glycine–aspartic
acid), which affects cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation.
However, the structural stability of gelatin-containing scaffolds
is limited because gelatin dissolves in water at 37 °C, which
is the temperature of the human body. Methacrylated gelatin (GelMA)
is produced by treating gelatin with methacrylic anhydride; this can
change the hardness of a hydrogel by shortening the time needed for
UV exposure.29 We have recently demonstrated
that cellular proliferation and differentiation can be increased considerably
using NFs. This approach eliminates the need for a collagen matrix
and allows for the culture of fibroblast and epithelial cell lines.30 The Michael-type addition is a nucleophilic
addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compound. This reaction is traditionally used in materials
science to prepare hydrogels,31,32 polymer films,33 and gold nanoparticles.34 When the thiol group of poly(ethylene glycol) hexathiol is mixed
with the acrylate group of poly(ethylene glycol) tetraacrylate at
a 1:1 ratio, the poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)-based hydrogel was synthesized
within 10 min.35 Disadvantages of using
a thiol-Michael-type addition include malodorous precursors that contain
thiol groups and the possible degeneration of the disulfide, which
occurs because of the thiol groups and a lack of spatial and temporal
control of the network structure during gelation.36 To address these issues, Lensen et al. produced a hydrogel
via an amine Michael-type addition.31 An
eight-arm poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate (8PEG) hydrogel was formed
via the Michael-type reaction using 8PEG and 8PEG-NH2.
As the ratio of NH2 in the polymer increased, the time
needed for gelation decreased from a maximum of 170 min to less than
5 min. This 3D culture system used various chemical modifications
on the matrix surface to more accurately mimic the conditions of living
tissues, thereby increasing cellular affinity for this matrix.

In this study, we developed a straightforward approach for fragmentizing
electrospun fibers used to modify the surfaces of NFs affixed to GelMA
via Michael-type addition. Because gelatin moieties can be easily
decorated on the surface of the nanofiber by a simple chemistry, gelatin-based
nanofibrils can affect proliferation and differentiation of cultivating
cells to form a cell/matrix assembly.

Results and Discussion
In this study, we used a straightforward method to fragmentize
electrospun fibers and modify the surfaces of NFs that had been affixed
to GelMA by chemical bonding via Michael-type addition. During the
coculture of cells and NFs, the cells and fragmented fibers spontaneously
formed cell sheets. Using these cell sheets, we then evaluated the
effects of PCL-based scaffolds on cell proliferation, adhesion, and
spreading (Figure 1). The fibers were initially prepared using biodegradable PCL by
electrospinning. We then fragmentized the fibers into hydrolyzed nanofibrils
(hPCL NFs) so that hydroxyl groups are exposed on the surface. Surface-exposed
amine groups were generated by treating NFs with ethylenediamine via
aminolysis (ahPCL NFs) (Figure 1A). This simple method improves the hydrophilicity of polymer
surfaces and cytocompatibility.37 Furthermore,
this reaction also roughens the surface down to the depth of several
micrometers.38 In our previous study, we
used PEI moieties to functionalize the surface of a nanofiber with
primary amines.26 We first synthesized
carboxyl-terminated PCL by ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone
and octanoic acid and then chemically conjugated PEI to the carboxyl
end of PCL to generate a PCL–PEI block copolymer. However,
the block copolymer was highly hydrophobic and needed to be modified
to increase hydrophilicity. Increasing hydrophilicity is a prerequisite
for improving proliferation. Thereby, we electrospun the copolymers
and then multilayered PEG on the copolymer mat surface after activating
the hydroxyl groups on PEG. To increase the hydrophilicity of the
PCL–PEI mesh, we conjugated PEG onto the surface of the mesh
and used ahPCL NFs to further modify the matrix surface and to enhance
the hydrophilic properties of NFs. However, we developed a simpler method
for decorating the polymer surface with primary amines for enhanced
functionalization. The amount of primary amine groups in the ahPCL
NFs was 355 ± 29.3 nmol/mg using fluorescamine assay. In comparison
to our previous study of PCL-PEI block copolymer, it was 58.34 ±
10.04 nmol/mg of amines on it. As shown in Figure 1B, we first reacted ahPCL NF and the methacrylate
group of GelMA with an amine group via Michael addition without any
further activation of the polymers. Then, we chemically conjugated
GelMA onto NFs. We previously showed that PCL NFs can spontaneously
associate with cells in culture to form cell/matrix complexes. In
the present study, we cultivated GelMA NFs with human dermal fibroblasts
(HDF) and evaluated how NFs decorated with GelMA affect the formation
of cell sheets, as well as cell spreading and proliferation (Figure 1C).

aminolyzed hPCL nanofibrils (ahPCL
NFs) for cell adhesion and proliferation. (A) Electrospun PCL fibers
were hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide to make fibrils and aminolyzed

gelatin (GelMA) and chemical reaction with GelMA on the NF surface

proliferation and stretching.

To evaluate the effects of GelMA on NF, we incubated gelatin or
GelMA with hPCL or ahPCL NF at different concentrations. The amount
of proteins attached to each NF was measured by directly quantifying
the amount of protein incorporated in gelatin and that of GelMA incorporated
in NF by melting the protein-containing NFs in hot water (Table 1). We found that at
low concentrations of protein used for incorporation (1 μg/mL
gelatin equivalent), GelMA@ahPCL showed the highest level of protein
incorporation compared with that of GelMA@hPCL, gelatin@ahPCL, and
gelatin@hPCL. However, no differences between the complexes were found
when a higher concentration of gelatin equivalent was employed for
surface decoration (100 μg/mL gelatin equivalent). We speculate
that the surface-exposed amines on ahPCL contributed to a higher degree
of protein incorporation via Michael-type addition by methacrylate
groups of GelMA and surface-amine groups. However, an excessive concentration
of protein may induce protein–protein aggregation rather than
Michael-type reactions between amines and methacrylates. Thus, the
Michael-type reaction can be advantageous when low concentrations
of protein are employed for surface decoration on ahPCL NFs.

that was incubated for 6 h and Gi is the

Digital images were used to evaluate the overall morphology
of
individual NFs and to compare volumetric differences during the preparation
of GelMA@ahPCL NFs (Figure 2A). Using the same weight of freeze-dried NFs (10 mg), GelMA@ahPCL
NF exhibited the highest volume, which is followed by those of ahPCL
and GelMA@hPCL. GelMA@ahPCL NFs showed “fluffy” morphology
upon freeze-drying, which increased the mass of these NFs. We speculate
that these differences are caused by surface-charge upon aminolysis.
ahPCL NFs exhibited higher amine density on the surface, indicating
that electrostatic repulsion among NFs can be increased in functionalized
NFs compared with that of non-treated NF. To evaluate the degree of
attachment between GelMA and ahPCL NFs, various NFs were incubated
with fluorescently stained GelMA for 1 h and the fluorescence intensity
was determined by in vivo imaging system (IVIS) (Figure 2B). To eliminate non-covalently
associated protein from the NFs, protein-bound NFs were washed thrice
with Tween-20. hPCL NFs, and ahPCL NFs without GelMA did not emit
fluorescence. However, GelMA@ahPCL NFs containing the amine groups
on their surface (added via chemical reaction) emitted a higher fluorescence
intensity than that of GelMA@hPCL NFs (containing GelMA added via
physical coating). These findings indicate that a greater amount of
GelMA was fixed on ahPCL NFs than that on hPCL NFs, showing that Michael-type
chemical addition performed better than physical coating. The morphology
of these matrices was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Our results indicate that the length and diameter of the NFs did not
change significantly after physical or chemical adsorption of GelMA,
but the length of the NFs changed after aminolysis (Figure 2C). The length and diameter
of hPCL NFs and GelMA@hPCL NFs were approximately 15 and 2 μm,
respectively, and those of ahPCL NFs and GelMA@ahPCL NFs were 10 and
1.5 μm, respectively. A previous study indicated that electrospun
PLA fibers fragmented in 1,6-hexanediamine/2-propanol became shorter
over time due to fragmentation.39 In another
study, a PLA microfiber was chemically cut via aminolysis using different
time periods and various ethylenediamine concentrations.40 The results of that study indicated that extending
the time of aminolysis progressively decreased the fiber length and
increased the roughness of the fiber surface. These findings suggest
that aminolysis likely decreases the fiber length and diameter via
corrosive effects of ethylenediamine on polyesters.

We then analyzed the surfaces of the four types of NFs using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our results show that NFs decorated
with GelMA showed unique peaks compared with those of native NFs not
bearing GelMA (Figure 3). Wide-scan XPS showed that for all four NFs, C 1s and O 1s peaks
appeared at 285.43 and 532.75 eV, respectively. For the two types
of NFs coated with GelMA, the N 1s peak was observed at 400.14 eV,
indicating that N was present on the corresponding NF. As verified
by IVIS (Figure 2B),
the N 1s peak of the chemically bonded GelMA@ahPCL NF showed a higher
intensity over the same duration (Figure 3A). Deconvolution of high-resolution spectra
for carbon elements in hPCL NF, ahPCL NF, GelMA@hPCL NF, and GelMA@ahPCL
NF showed three subpeaks (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the following peaks were used to confirm
and characterize the chemistry of GelMA decorated onto the surface
of NFs: peak 1 near 284.6 eV, representing the carbon in C–C/C–H
bonds; peak 2 near 287.88 eV, representing the carbon in C–O/C-N
bonds; peak 3 near 288.68 eV,40,41 representing the carbon
in the C=O bond. As shown in a previous study, XPS peaks at
approximately 286 eV, indicative of C–N and C–O bonding,
do not appear clearly separated.42 Similarly,
peaks corresponding to C–O and C–N bonds appear at 285.5
and 286.2 eV, respectively, with nearly no difference in the binding
energy.43 XPS high-resolution spectra for
C 1s were used to evaluate the ratio of peak areas of C–O/C–N
bonds normalized to those of C–C/C–H (284.58 eV) (Figure 3C). Among the four
NFs, GelMA@ahPCL NF showed the highest peak ratio for the carbon in
C–O/C–N bonds normalized to the peak indicating the
carbon in C–C/C–H bonds. This suggests that GelMA@ahPCL
NF contained the highest number of C–N bonds among the four
NFs. In summary, XPS analysis of surface chemistry showed that the
area of C–O/C–N bonds was altered by chemical treatment
and that GelMA@ahPCL NFs adsorbed the highest amount of GelMA among
the four NFs.

To investigate the effect of GelMA
immobilization on the surface
of the NFs, we cultured HDF cells in the presence of respective NFs
in non-treated 48-well plates. After 24 hours of culture, cell sheets
composed of HDF and NFs started to form for all of the NF groups.
However, cell sheet self-assembly of NFs containing gelatin or GelMA
occurred more rapidly than that of non-decorated NFs; on day 3, the
cell sheet containing GelMA@ahPCL NFs showed the most condensed association
of cell–matrix complexes compared with those of other groups
(Figure 4A, insets).
Furthermore, cells in GelMA-associated NF (GelMA@hPCL NF, GelMA@ahPCL
NF) exhibited more spread shapes in comparison to non-decorated NF
(hPCL NF, ahPCL NF). Similarly, we previously observed that hPCL NFs
self-assembled into cell sheets when cells were cultured with this
matrix in untreated cell culture plates.19 We speculate that immobilized gelatin can facilitate interactions
between cells and NF because gelatin exerts high proliferation. Confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed that cells on NFs containing
gelatin showed a higher degree of proliferation and spreading compared
with cells grown on non-decorated counterparts. Cells cultured with
hPCL NFs were round on day 3, while cells cultured with GelMA@hPCL
NFs and GelMA@ahPCL showed a stretched morphology with enhanced expression
of cytoskeletal proteins. Previously, we revealed that PCL NFs, produced
by electrospinning, provided an artificial environment that closely
resembled ECM microstructures in native tissues; in this artificial
environment, a cell sheet was formed via interactions between HDF
cells and NFs within 24 h. Three-dimensional sheet structures have
been obtained via spontaneous assembly when gelatin and GelMA were
added to hPCL NFs and cocultured with HDF cells.30 Similarly, the cores of GelMA@ahPCL NFs and PCL NFs can
serve as adhesion points for anchorage-dependent cells, while decorated
gelatin moieties can enhance the viability of the attached cells by
providing denatured components of natural ECM. Gelatin-based scaffolds
can promote cell adhesion44 and have similar
properties to those of ECM45 due to the
presence of a matrix metalloproteinase-responsive peptide motif that
induces cell proliferation and spreading. Thus, we quantified the
proliferation of HDF cells in the cell sheets over the course of 5
days (Figure 4B). When
rates of cell proliferation were normalized with respect to the number
of cells present on TCPS on day 1, we found that levels of proliferation
had gradually increased according to the degree of gelatin decoration.
On day 1, the four types of sheets showed similar levels of proliferation.
However, on day 3, cell proliferation on GelMA@ahPCL NFs was higher
than that on other NFs. These differences were statistically significant.
Although GelMA@hPCL NFs and GelMA@ahPCL NFs generated similar cell
spreading behaviors, the level of cell proliferation on GelMA@ahPCL
NFs was higher than that on GelMA@hPCL NFs. This can be contributed
to the degree of gelatin decoration on the NFs. Figures 2B and 3C confirmed
higher levels of gelatin decoration in GelMA@ahPCL NFs compared with
those of GelMA@hPCL NFs. Thus, GelMA@ahPCL NFs can be used as a scaffold
for 3D cell culture, while decorated GelMA can enhance the proliferation
of the attached cells, resulting in an increased cellular viability
(Figure 4B). However,
no further proliferation was observed on day 5 because our cell sheet
had a confined area, which limited the space available for cell growth.
The WST-1 assay can reflect the metabolic status of individual cells;
however, more importantly, the higher the cell number, the higher
the WST-1 absorbance measured. Thus, in terms of determining proliferation
levels, we normalized WST-1 values with respect to those at day 1
to monitor the increase of cell numbers. Additionally, aminolysis
of NF did not affect the biocompatibility of the matrix becasuse ahPCL
NF and hPCL NF did not show a dramatic difference of the viability.

The absorbance at 450 nm of all samples was normalized with respect
to that of cells in TCPS at day 1.

Conclusions
Michael-type addition between vinyl groups of GelMA and surface-exposed
amines of ahPCL NFs resulted in a higher degree of decoration on ahPCL
NFs compared with that on hPCL NFs. GelMA@ahPCL NFs markedly facilitated
cell sheet formation, and HDF cells showed higher levels of viability
and cell spreading in the cell sheets compared with those on GelMA@hPCL
NFs or NFs not containing gelatin. Therefore, a simple strategy of
gelatin decoration on NF can be a promising method to engineer surfaces
of the fibrous matrix to enhance 3D construction of the cell/matrix
complex.

Electrospinning
PCL nanofibers were
fabricated via
partial digestion of electrospun PCL nanofibers as described in our
previous study.19 Briefly, 25% (w/v) solution
of PCL in a chloroform/methanol mixture (3:1, v/v) was electrospun
at 15 kV using a flow rate of 1 mL/h through a 25-G needle. Electrospun
nanofibers were fabricated at temperature ranging 20–25 °C
and relative humidity ranging 16–20%. The electrospun nanofiber
was collected onto the aluminum foil ground for 10 min at a ground-to-needle
distance of 15 cm. The PCL nanofibers were detached with ethanol and
milled for 30 s; this step was repeated 3 times.

Fabrication
of NFs
Milled nanofibers were hydrolyzed
in 1.0 M solution of sodium hydroxide at 37 °C for 12 h. hPCL
NFs were filtered through a sieve having 100 μm pore size, then
washed with distilled water, and pelleted via centrifugation 3 times.
Consequently, hPCL NFs (300 mg) were aminolyzed in 60 mL of 1.0 M
ethylenediamine/methanol at 37 °C with magnetic stirring for
72 h. ahPCL NFs were washed 4 times with methanol, once with distilled
water, and then freeze-dried. The surface-exposed primary amine groups
on hPCL or ahPCL NFs were quantified using a fluorescamine assay as
described previously.46 Briefly, 1 mg of
NFs was placed into 1 mL of methanol; this solution was then combined
with 0.3 mg/mL fluorescamine in 0.1 mL of acetone. The mixture was
stirred vigorously and incubated at room temperature in the dark for
30 min. Afterward, NFs were washed with methanol and redissolved in
1 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The fluorescence intensity was measured at Ex
390/Em 475 nm using a spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation,
Japan). Ethylenediamine was used as a standard.

Gelatin Immobilization
on NFs
To immobilize gelatin,
NFs were chemically reacted with GelMA via Michael-type addition.
Briefly, 0.2 mL of methacrylic anhydride (MA) was slowly added to
a 10% (w/v) gelatin solution (10 mL) under vigorous stirring and the
mixture was reacted at 50 °C for 3 h to obtain GelMA. The resulting
solution was precipitated thrice in ice-cold ethanol to remove unreacted
MA, and the precipitated GelMA was freeze-dried. Methacrylation of
gelatin in D2O was confirmed using 1H NMR spectroscopy
at the Central Laboratory of Kangwon National University (JNM-ECZ400S/L1,
Japan). NFs (20 mg) were incubated with GelMA dissolved in PBS (30
μg/mL, 10 mL, pH 7.4) under magnetic stirring at 37 °C
for 1–12 h. The degree of GelMA immobilization was determined
via BCA assay as described previously. Briefly, NFs immobilized onto
GelMA were washed 3 times using 0.1% (w/v) Tween-20; this step was
used to physically disassociate GelMA and NFs, thereby removing GelMA
from NFs. All NFs were freeze-dried overnight before the analysis.
The amount of conjugated proteins on the NFs was evaluated via the
BCA-based assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, 0.1 mg of NFs was dissolved in 0.1 mL of boiled distilled
water. Then, a BCA-based working reagent (0.1 mL) was added to samples
(0.1 mg) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The absorbance was
measured at 562 nm using Multiskan GO (Thermo Scientific, UK). Native
GelMA was used as a standard.

Characterization of GelMA-Conjugated
NFs
NFs dispersed
in ethanol were placed on aluminum foil, and samples were observed
by field-emission resolution scanning electronic microscopy (FE-SEM)
(S-4300; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at the Central Laboratory of Kangwon
National University. For visualization, GelMA-conjugated NFs were
incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I-labeled GelMA (FITC-GelMA)
and evaluated using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS 2000; PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA) at the Korea Basic Science Institute. Immobilization
of GelMA on NFs was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) (Thermo Scientific, UK) at the Central Laboratory of Kangwon
National University, and spectra were obtained for C 1s, N 1s, and
O 1s. High-resolution scans were obtained for carbon (C 1s).

Fabrication
of NF/Cell Sheet
A suspension of HDF cells
at passage 5 (2 × 105 cells/well) in DMEM was thoroughly
mixed with 2 mg of hPCL NF, GelMA@hPCL NF, ahPCL NF, or GelMA@ahPCL
NF via gentle pipetting, and the mixture (400 μl) was seeded
into an untreated 48-well plate containing DMEM supplemented with
low serum growth supplement (LSGS) and 1% (v/v) streptomycin/penicillin.
The matrix/cell complexes were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cell culture medium was replaced daily. Cell proliferation
was determined using a WST-1-based colorimetric assay according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 20 μl of WST-1
solution was added to each well of the 48-well plate described above
and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The absorbance was measured
at 450 nm via Multiscan GO (Thermo Scientific, UK). To evaluate the
effect of hPCL NFs, GelMA@hPCL NFs, ahPCL NFs, and GelMA@ahPCL NFs
on cell proliferation and spreading, the NF/cell complexes were fixed
with 3.7% formaldehyde solution for 50 min and treated with Triton
X-100 (0.1%, v/v) for 5 min. The samples were stained with Alexa Fluor
488 phalloidin for 50 min and counterstained with DAPI for 3 min for
F-actin and nucleus visualization, respectively. The NF/cell complexes
were evaluated via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using
a diode laser at 405 nm for DAPI and a Mar laser at 488 nm for Alexa
Flour and 488 phalloidin at the Central Laboratory of Kangwon National
University.
