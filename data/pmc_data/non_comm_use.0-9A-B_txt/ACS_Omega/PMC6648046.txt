Hybrid
thin films of crystalline CuSCN and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-4′-(N′-methyl)stilbazolium
(DAS) in three distinctively different nanostructures were obtained
by electrochemical self-assembly from a single pot containing all
the chemical ingredients. Their optical properties for UV–vis-NIR
absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and PL excitation spectra were
examined between 77 and 298 K, in comparison with solution and solid
powder of DAS tosylate (DAST). Unlike all other dyes we tested before,
PL of DAS was not quenched but rather enhanced when hybridized with
CuSCN. DAST exhibited a strong exciton–phonon coupling to weaken,
broaden, and red shift PL at room temperature, so that it inversely
is strongly enhanced, sharpened, and blue-shifted at 77 K. The PL
of the same dye in the hybrid thin film, however, shows a slight red
shift and only a moderate enhancement at reduced temperatures due
to strong exciton stabilization in dielectric environment of CuSCN
and concerted PL by energy transfer from CuSCN to DAS luminophore,
making it a unique nearly temperature-independent luminescent material.

Introduction
Combination of inorganic
and organic materials offers unlimited
opportunities in the synthesis of new materials. Whereas “composites”
typically stands for their physical mixtures to exploit physical properties
of each component together, such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics,
“hybrids” and “inorganic/organic compounds”
are especially interesting for concerted new functionalities expected
from intimate interaction between inorganic and organic constituents,
since they are combined together by self-assembly due to favorable
“chemistry” between them.

We have previously established
a method to electrochemically self-assemble
(ESA) inorganic/organic hybrid thin films.1−5 When organic molecules with certain anchoring groups
are added to the baths for cathodic electrodeposition of inorganic
compound thin films, and when there is a right chemistry between the
added molecule and the inorganic compound to be deposited, ESA of
nanostructured hybrid thin film spontaneously occurs. For example,
organic dye molecules bearing a carboxylic acid group such as Eosin
Y undergoes ESA with ZnO when they are added to aqueous ZnCl2 bath saturated with O2,5−8 whereas many cationic dyes afford hybrid
thin films during cathodic electrodeposition of CuSCN by replacing
a part of Cu+ ions.9,10 Wrong combination such
as that adding Eosin Y to the bath for CuSCN electrodeposition, namely,
alcoholic solutions containing Cu2+ and SCN– ions, did not yield hybrid thin films, indicating strict selectivity
in ESA.5,11

The strong interaction between inorganic
and organic constituents
to achieve ESA in return lets us anticipate concerted new functionalities.
The leading example is the photoelectrochemical charge separation
used in dye-sensitized solar cells.12 Photoexcited
organic dye molecules bound to the surface of inorganic semiconductors
inject either electron or hole to the conduction band of n-type metal
oxide2,4,12,13 or to the valence band of p-type materials such as
NiO14 or CuSCN,9,15,16 respectively, when the energy levels of
the constituents are matched. Such light-induced charge separation
has also been observed for the hybrid thin films by ESA in their solid
states. The fluorescence of Eosin Y was completely quenched for the
ZnO/Eosin Y hybrid thin film by ESA2 and
a color-selective photoconductor could be achieved with this material
owing to the photocarrier generation.13 Likewise, total quenching of fluorescence was also observed for
the CuSCN/dye hybrid thin films by ESA with highly fluorescent dyes
such as rhodamine B (RB) and Nile blue A.17 Indeed, dye-sensitized photocathodic current was observed for a
porous CuSCN sensitized with RB.9

A totally contrasting concerted photophysical functionality has
been discovered for CuSCN hybrid thin films with 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-4′-(N′-methyl)stilbazolium
(DAS) and is reported in this paper. ESA of CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin
films has successfully been achieved and established by the addition
of DAS tosylate salt (DAST, Figure 1) into the bath for electrodeposition of CuSCN.10 DAST crystal is known for its nonlinear optical
(NLO) properties owing to the ordered alignment of the strong dipole
of DAS cations, exhibiting special functionalities such as frequency-modulation
for terahertz generation18−20 and two-photon excited fluorescence
upconversion.21,22

Figure 1 Structure of DAST.

Unlike all other fluorescent dye molecules we tested before,
the
present CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin films have been found to exhibit strong
fluorescence from the DAS luminophore enhanced by the CuSCN host.
Highly polar environment of inorganic CuSCN can favor ordering of
DAS during the ESA. In fact, we have achieved hybrid thin films in
three distinctively different structures out of the same materials
combination, simply by tuning DAST concentration in the deposition
bath.10 Their photoluminescence (PL) properties
have been examined in a temperature range between 77 and 298 K, and
in comparison with those of DAST and CuSCN, to elucidate the origin
of the concerted photoluminescence.

Result and Discussion
Cathodic electrodeposition of CuSCN thin films has already been
well established and understood.9,11,16,23 A 1:1 complex between Cu2+ and SCN– ions, denoted as [Cu(SCN)]+, is spontaneously formed by dissolving equal molar amounts
of Cu(ClO4)2 and LiSCN in alcohol such as methanol
and ethanol. This complex is the active species to be reduced at the
electrode to precipitate CuSCN with a Faradic efficiency of practically
100%.16,23 1  Since charge transfer is fast, this reaction
is solely limited by the transport of [Cu(SCN)]+ even in
the presence of dyes to hybridize.23,24 For this reason,
we employ a rotating disk electrode (RDE) to control mass transport
by homogeneous forced convection. Thus, highly homogeneous and well-adherent
thin films can be obtained in a reproducible manner.

The pure
CuSCN thin film without the addition of DAST is made of
particles with smooth surface in 100–200 nm size (Figure 2a), crystallized
into rhombohedral β-CuSCN.10 Increasing
addition of DAST in the deposition bath results in drastic changes
of the morphology, crystal orientation/structure, and dye loading.10 With the minor addition at 25 μmol dm–3, DAS is “occluded” inside of β-CuSCN
grains.10 Although some roughness is recognized
on its surface (Figure 2b), it was not possible to dissolve away DAS by soaking this film
in dimethylacetamide (DMA), which is a good solvent of DAS but poor
for CuSCN, so the film remained intact.10 At 250 μmol dm–3, a unique “haircomb”
nanostructure appears (Figure 2c). It has previously been found that the teeth of the haircomb
are oriented along the c-axis of β-CuSCN and
DAS precipitated in large amount is phase separated to fill out the
gap between the teeth, so that an interdigitated inorganic/organic
hybrid nanostructure is spontaneously formed. As the organic moiety
is segregated from CuSCN, soaking this film in DMA results in a total
extraction of DAS to leave the CuSCN haircomb.10 The transition from occluded to haircomb hybrid structures
is quantitatively understood, as it is caused by the switching of
dye-loading mechanism.24 With low DAST
concentration, the loading of DAS is diffusion limited, so that all
the DAS ions reaching the electrode surface are buried inside the
CuSCN grain. When DAST concentration is high, surface reaction of
hybridization limits the loading to allow structural re-organization
into the unique phase-separated nanostructure.10 With an extreme high addition of DAST at 1000 μmol
dm–3, the film morphology changes once again into
a “scale”-like nanostructure (Figure 2d). CuSCN in fact changes from the β-form
into monoclinic α-CuSCN.10 The space
between the interconnected nanoplatelets is filled with DAS, so that
its lamellar structure becomes apparent when soaked in DMA.10 The reason for the transition from haircomb
to scale is presently unknown and is a subject of our study. What
has been shown and documented here is the fact that we can produce
CuSCN/DAS hybrid nanostructures in three distinctively different forms
out of the same components, which then are very interesting samples
to be compared.

and 1000 μmol dm–3 ((d) phase-separated α-CuSCN/DAS

Figure 3 compares
the UV–vis–NIR absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and
PL excitation (PLE) spectra measured at 298 K for methanolic solution
of DAST, solid powder of DAST, DAS adsorbed on commercial β-CuSCN
powder from DAST solution, and the haircomb CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin
film prepared by ESA. Well-resolved fluorescence peak at 612 nm is
observed for the DAST solution with its PLE nicely matched with the
absorption spectrum. DAS undergoes an intramolecular charge transfer
(IMCT) excitation due to its strong transition dipole and results
in a twisting of the chromophore in polar media.17,22 Because of this strong exciton relaxation, specifically called twisted
intramolecular charge transfer (TICT),17 it exhibits a large Stokes shift for about 130 nm. The absorption
spectrum of DAST crystal powder is significantly broadened, especially
toward the longer wavelength to create a shoulder around 590 nm, due
to J-type head-to-tail interaction caused by ordering of the DAS chromophore.
The PL of DAST powder is also significantly broadened and red-shifted
compared to that of the solution, showing its peak around 720 nm.
Exciton–phonon coupling to delocalize exciton within the DAST
crystal significantly reduces the PL energy toward the NIR range.
The PLE spectrum became featureless due to optical saturation, which
could not be overcome even by reducing the excitation power nor by
diluting the sample with Al2O3 powder as a purely
scattering material. One should therefore only pay attention to the
onset wavelengths, which are matched with those of the absorption
spectrum.

Figure 3 UV–vis absorption, PL, and PLE spectra of 10 μmol
dm–3 DAST solution in methanol (λex = 475 nm for PL, λem = 615 nm for PLE), DAST powder
(λex = 500 nm, λem = 720 nm), CuSCN/DAS
hybrid thin film by ESA from a bath containing 250 μmol dm–3 DAST (λex = 500 nm, λem = 700 nm), and DAS adsorbed on CuSCN powder from methanolic
solution of DAST (λex = 480 nm, λem = 700 nm) measured at 298 K. The absorption spectra were measured
in transmission, whereas in diffuse-reflection for powder and film
samples.

When the absorption spectra of
the CuSCN/DAS hybrid samples are
compared, their energy appears between those of the solution and powder
of the DAST sample. The peak is slightly shifted and broadened strictly
toward red from that of the solution, unlike the DAST powder that
shows broadening also toward blue. In fact, the similarity of the
absorption spectra between CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin film and DAS adsorbed
on CuSCN powder was quite surprising to us because of their significant
difference in optical densities. Whereas the former is intensely red,
the latter was only slightly pink because DAS is present as aggregates
in the former but only monolayer of DAS should be present as adsorbed
on CuSCN surface in the latter. Electronic interaction of DAS with
CuSCN should therefore be the dominant reason to cause the observed
change of the optical character of the hybrid materials. Despite their
close similarity of the absorption spectra, the PL spectra of the
film and powder completely differed. First, it should be reminded
with emphasis that DAS is the first and only example to show PL when
hybridized with CuSCN, so far as our experiences are concerned. All
other dyes we tested underwent total quenching of fluorescence. Since
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of DAS has been estimated
as −5.48 eV (vs VAC),25 well below
the valence band edge of CuSCN (−5.3 eV),15 the hole injection from photoexcited DAS to CuSCN could
very well be expected from the energy alignment point of view.

DAS adsorbed on CuSCN powder emits just like the monomer in a solution,
showing a sharp peak, which, in fact, is slightly blue-shifted to
around 600 nm. It is likely that the relaxation by TICT is suppressed
within the densely adsorbed DAS layer. On the contrary, the PL spectrum
of the hybrid thin film by ESA is clearly broader than that of the
DAST solution but narrower than that of the powder, with its peak
around 680 nm right between them, indicating its own energetic structure.
We are unable to quantify the efficiency of PL in the present setup
that typically measures for excitation beam incidence at 60°
and monitoring at 30° with respect to the plane of the film and
powder samples to avoid direct reflection of the excitation beam.
Because each sample has rather different optical density and reflectivity,
total absorption and emission need to be measured by employing an
integration sphere for the calculation of PL quantum yields to achieve
strict comparison. However, strong PL intensity was monitored for
the hybrid film samples despite their limited optical density and
specular reflection as compared to the DAST powder that has infinitely
large optical density and a totally matt appearance (see the Supporting Information for comparison of PL spectra
intensity measured for the same slit width).

To scrutinize the
PL properties of DAST, temperature dependence
of PL and PLE has been examined in a temperature range between 77
and 298 K both for its solution in methanol and its solid powder (Figure 4). The PL of DAS
in methanol is significantly enhanced with decrease of temperature
owing to suppressed nonradiative decay by TICT. Moreover, the PL energy
abruptly shifts from about 610–580 nm between 200 and 150 K
upon freezing of the solvent methanol (melting point = 176 K). These
changes coincide with those of the PLE spectra, showing an abrupt
large red shift of the peak wavelength to decrease the Stokes shift
down to ca. 50 nm at 77 K. The freezing of the molecular twisting
motion makes the chromophore planar to reduce the HOMO–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap. On the other hand, the solid
DAST shows strong enhancement, sharpening, and blue shift of PL upon
decrease in temperature. Comparison of the PL spectra between 77 and
298 K clearly shows the sharpening and blue shift of the peak wavelength
as much as 60 nm due to suppressed exciton delocalization within the
DAST crystals. The PLE spectra once again are rather featureless,
but begin to show a clear peak at around 610 nm upon reduction of
temperature. These strong enhancement, sharpening, and blue shift
of the PL peaks for the DAST samples on decrease in temperature were
well-expected and simple to understand as consequences of suppressed
exciton relaxation to reduce its loss by thermalization.

Figure 4 Temperature-dependent
PL and PLE spectra of DAST as 10 μmol
dm–3 solution in methanol ((a) λex = 480 nm for PL, λem = 625 nm for PLE) and solid
powder ((b) λex = 500 nm, λem =
720 nm) measured between 77 and 298 K. The dashed line in (b) is the
PL spectrum at 298 K enlarged 35 times to facilitate the comparison
to that at 77 K.

Finally, temperature-dependent
PL and PLE spectra were examined
for three different kinds of CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin films prepared
by ESA (Figure 5).
All of them exhibit PL clearly originating from DAS, but their energy
differ from one to the other with different peak wavelengths and shapes
of the spectra, indicating differences of the environments for the
DAS luminophore in these films. The PL intensity is enhanced for all
the samples upon decrease in temperature but to a much lesser extent
than those of the solution and powder of DAST. Especially, the haircomb
hybrid shows only a marginal increase with less than 2 times enhancement
compared between 77 and 298 K (Figure 5b). The remarkable finding is the slight “red-shift”
of the PL peaks for all the samples, which clearly contrary to the
behavior of DAST solution and solid. The broadening of the PL peaks
of the hybrid thin films suggests the delocalization of exciton within
DAS aggregates, which should be present in these samples, rather than
emission from molecularly confined exciton. Dielectric environment
of the surrounding CuSCN seems to result in a strong stabilization
of exciton in DAS aggregates and the differences of the hybrid structure
result in different degrees of interaction to cause observed differences
of the PL behavior for the three kinds of CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin films.
At present, we are unable to comment on the difference of absolute
quantum yields of PL from these hybrid films, also with respect to
those of the solution and solid of DAST, since optical density differs
from film to film.10 The higher DAST concentration
for electrodeposition results in the higher DAS content in the film,
so that the PL intensity at room temperature appeared in the order
as scale > haircomb > occluded (see the Supporting Information), although total emission based on total absorption
needs to be compared by measuring them with an integration sphere
to talk about their PL efficiencies. For all these films, however,
rather temperature-independent PL obviously speaks for suppressed
thermalization loss of exciton. Also, the independence of the Stokes
shift on temperature indicates suppressed vibronic motion of DAS in
the hybrids.

Figure 5 Temperature-dependent PL (λex = 500 nm)
and PLE
(λem = 720 nm) spectra of CuSCN/DAST hybrid thin
films by ESA from baths containing DAST at 25 μmol dm–3 ((a) DAS occluded in β-CuSCN), 250 μmol dm–3 ((b) phase separated β-CuSCN/DAS in a haircomb nanostructure),
and 1000 μmol dm–3 ((c) phase separated α-CuSCN/DAS
in a scale nanostructure) measured between 77 and 298 K.

The PLE spectra of the hybrid thin films indicate
the main contribution
of direct IMCT photoexcitation of DAS as all of them show high intensities
between 450 and 600 nm, matched with the absorption spectra of the
samples. However, the spectra become rather distorted at reduced temperatures,
especially for the scale α-CuSCN/DAS hybrid (Figure 5c), showing a prominent sharp
peak at 380 nm and another double peak in the range between 400 and
450 nm at 77 K. Similar distortion is actually observed to smaller
degrees for the haircomb (Figure 5b) and occluded (Figure 5a) hybrids. None of them, however, show such features
in their absorption spectra, so that some accounts need to be made
for these additional peaks in the PLE.

We then checked the PL
spectra for the pure β-CuSCN thin
film electrodeposited without DAST, β-CuSCN powder, and also
the precursor solution for the electrodeposition of CuSCN, namely,
[Cu(SCN)]+ in methanol (Figure 6). Even though apparently rather weak, the
broad emission peak for CuSCN thin film appeared at around 826 nm.
The CuSCN powder also exhibited a broad emission even weaker and in
a shorter wavelength range than the electrodeposited film. Then, a
very weak but rather well-resolved PL peak at 872 nm was detected
for the [Cu(SCN)]+ complex in solution. Interestingly,
the PLE spectrum of the pure CuSCN thin film shows the very features
of the PLE spectra of the CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin films (Figure 5), although these peaks at
380 and 400–450 nm range are not recognized in its absorption
spectrum. The PLE of the powder sample shows a broad peak centered
at about 420 nm, which is also not seen in the absorption spectrum.
Unfortunately, the PLE spectrum could not be measured for the [Cu(SCN)]+ solution due to its too weak emission. CuSCN is known to
behave as a p-type semiconductor due to the presence of Cu2+ ions acting as acceptor levels in its SCN–-rich
composition.26 The broad emission in the
visible toward NIR is therefore most likely associated with the d–d
transition of Cu2+ ions. This state is expectedly localized
on the surface, as its extra charge is compensated by the surface-bound
SCN– ion. Coordination of SCN– ion to Cu2+ results in ligand-to-metal charge transfer
(LMCT) absorption, as it is clearly shown for the absorption spectrum
of [Cu(SCN)]+ solution peaked at around 390 nm.16 Thus, the photoaction triggered by light around
400–450 nm as observed in the PLE most likely originates from
the LMCT absorption at the surface-localized Cu2+ ions
to which SCN– ions are bound. On the other hand,
the sharp peak at 380 nm in the PLE can be associated with the band-edge
absorption of CuSCN for its band gap of around 3.4 eV.15 Because of the highly crystallized nature of
the electrodeposited CuSCN, these transitions are resolved well into
two peaks, whereas only a broad feature appeared for the disordered
CuSCN powder sample.

Figure 6 Absorption, PL, and PLE spectra of electrodeposited pure
β-CuSCN
thin film, β-CuSCN powder, and 50 μmol dm–3 [Cu(SCN)]+ solution in methanol (mixture of Cu(ClO4)2 and LiSCN both at 50 μmol dm–3) measured at 298 K. PL of thin film and powder were measured for
λex = 450 nm, whereas that of solution for λex = 385 nm. The PLE of thin film and powder were measured
for λem = 700 nm, whereas those of solution could
not be obtained due to too weak emission. Absorption spectra of thin
film and solution were measured in transmission, whereas those of
powder were measured in diffuse reflection.

To the best of our knowledge, little is known about the PL
properties
of CuSCN. However, the above-mentioned observations and arguments
already well explain that the additional peaks in the PLE of CuSCN/DAS
hybrid thin films are caused by CuSCN. Energy transfer from CuSCN
for its band-edge absorption (380 nm) and LMCT absorption (400–450
nm) at the surface results in enhanced concerted PL from DAS. Such
concerted PL by energy transfer has been found to occur most efficiently
for the scale α-CuSCN/DAS hybrid. Since the energy transfer
event is expected at the interface between CuSCN and DAS, the tiny
lamellar structure have made it most efficient among the three.

Conclusions
Optical properties of CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin films prepared by ESA
were examined. Unlike many other dye molecules we tested before, the
fluorescence of DAS was not quenched but rather enhanced when hybridized
with CuSCN. Dielectric environment as well as ordered alignment of
DAS by CuSCN greatly stabilizes the exciton against thermalization
loss by suppressing TICT and exciton–phonon coupling. Unlike
DAST solution and solid powder, PL of the CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin films
was much less enhanced on decreasing the temperature, associated with
a slight red-shift of the emission energy. The smallest temperature
dependence, thus to be interpreted as the strongest exciton stabilization,
was found for the haircomb β-CuSCN/DAS hybrid. Concerted PL
by energy transfer from CuSCN to DAS has also been found to occur
efficiently at reduced temperatures, especially for the scale α-CuSCN/DAS
with the largest contact area due to interpenetration of inorganic/organic
hybrid nanostructure in the smallest domain size.

The unique
PL behavior of the CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin films certainly
deserves further studies, since DAS is the first example whose PL
is not quenched by hybridization with CuSCN to the best of our knowledge.
Although we have only monitored single-photon-excited fluorescence
in the present study, DAST is also known for its two-photon-excited
upconverted fluorescence.21,22 Elucidating the NLO
properties of the CuSCN/DAS hybrid thin films with respect to variation
of their composition and nanostructure is therefore an exciting challenge
in future.

Experimental Section
Tosylate salt of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-4′-(N′-methyl)stilbazolium
(DAST) was synthesized according
to the procedure described in literature.27,28 CuSCN powder was purchased from TCI and used as received. It was
also modified by adsorbing DAS by putting 250 mg of CuSCN into 250
μmol dm–3 DAST solution in methanol and stirring
overnight at room temperature.

We have previously reported details
of ESA of CuSCN/DAS hybrid
thin films.9−11 In this study, we have employed a methanol (Wako)
containing 2.5 mmol dm–3 Cu(ClO4)2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 2.5 mmol dm–3 LiSCN (Kishida),
and 0.1 mol dm–3 LiClO4 (Wako, supporting
electrolyte) as the bath for potentiostatic (+0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl) cathodic
electrodeposition of CuSCN (under air, 298 K) for 180 s, according
to the diffusion-limited reduction of 1:1 complex between Cu2+ and SCN– ions, described as eq 1.16,23 F-Doped SnO2-coated conductive glass (Asahi-DU, 10 Ω sq–1) used as the substrate was furnished into a rotating disk electrode
(RDE, diameter = 14 mm, regulated by a masking tape) to achieve homogeneous
transport at ω = 500 rpm. DAST was dissolved at various concentrations
of 25, 250, and 1000 μmol dm–3 of the bath
to promote ESA of hybrid thin films. Surface morphology of the electrodeposited
thin films was observed by JEOL JSM-6700F field emission scanning
electron microscope.

UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra
were measured on a
SHIMADZU SolidSpec-3700 spectrophotometer in transmission (solutions
and thin films) and diffuse reflection (powder samples) employing
an integration sphere. Photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation (PLE)
spectra were measured on a HORIBA Fluorolog-3 equipped with a high-power
Xe lamp excitation source and lq. Liquid nitrogen cooled photomulpitlier
tube (PMT) detector in a temperature range between 77 and 298 K employing
a Janis VNF-100 cryostat. Appropriate long-pass filters with cutoff
wavelengths a bit shorter than the excitation were inserted to the
excitation beam to eliminate the influence of harmonic waves, whereas
another a bit longer long-pass was sometimes put in the monitoring
side to cut away the tail of the excitation beam.
