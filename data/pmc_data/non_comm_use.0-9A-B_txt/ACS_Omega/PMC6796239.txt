A calix[4]arene
conjugate possessing a tetrapyrenyl moiety at its
upper rim (R) is designed as a receptor for sensing trinitrophenol
(TNP). To understand the role of the calix[4]arene platform and that
of pyrenyl moieties in R, two other control molecules
were synthesized. These are as follows: the one possessing a tetraphenyl
moiety in place of tetrapyrenyl (R1) and the other one is a p-pyrenyl-hydroxy
benzene (R2) that is devoid of
the calix[4]arene platform. The R shows high sensitivity
toward TNP in tetrahydrofuran (THF) over eleven other nitroaromatic
compounds (NACs) studied by exhibiting large fluorescence enhancement
and hence is selective to TNP over the other NACs studied. However,
the control molecules R1 and R2 showed only marginal fluorescence
enhancement, supporting the need of a calixarene platform and the
presence of a tetrapyrenyl moiety in the receptor system for the selective
sensing of TNP. Further, R1 and R2 are not suitable for sensing, since
these exhibit similar fluorescence response over several NACs studied.
The binding of TNP by R has been addressed by fluorescence
titration and isothermal titration calorimetry. The nature of the
complexation of TNP by R has been revealed by the computational
calculations, wherein the data showed the entrapment of TNP by two
adjacent pyrene moieties via π–π stacking interactions.
Such host–guest complexation is expected to restrict the mobility
of the pyrene moieties present in R. The reduction of
the flexibility of the pyrenyl moieties of R upon TNP
binding is evidenced by the 1H NMR spectral study, wherein
this acts as an additional evidence for the complexation. In the present
study, the sensing of TNP by R has been shown in THF
solution, on the surface of silica gel and the cellulose paper to
result in lowest detection limits (LODs) of 1.5, 3.5, and 6.5 μM,
respectively. Even the solid mixture of R and TNP showed
LOD of 2.1 μmol. Since R is expected to show supramolecular
aggregation that is dependent on the guest species, the corresponding
details were probed by microscopy techniques, using scanning electron
microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy
methods, and significant changes in the aggregation of R upon interaction with TNP were found. Such aggregation is responsible
for the observed fluorescence enhancement. Thus, the tetrapyrenyl
calix[4]arene conjugate (R) acts as a sensitive and robust
platform for selective detection of TNP from a mixture of nitroaromatic
compounds (NACs) wherein the fluorescence intensities can be imaged
and managed by a cellular phone.

Introduction
In the present social
scenario, the safety and security have become
major issues due to the unlawful usage of explosive substances.1−4 Among these, the nitroaromatic compounds (NACs), such as trinitrotoluene
(TNT) and trinitrophenol (TNP) or the commonly known picric acid (PA),
are of great relevance. TNP is commonly used in the industries based
on pharmaceuticals and dyes, in addition to its use in the manufacture
of rocket fuel.5 Thus, the TNP is not just
an explosive precursor, but an environmentally hazardous compound
that leads to the health problems, such as the respiratory damage
and skin irritation.6,7 Thus, sensitive and selective
detection of TNP is a contemporary topic for scientists to focus on.
Many fluorophores reported in the literature for the detection of
TNP are based on fluorescence turn-off.8−16 Such sensors are associated with disadvantages since the fluorescence
quenching is challenged by the fluctuations of background fluorescence,
flexibility in the excited state of the species, and strong interaction
between the excited state and the lattice. Hence, the sensors that
function on turn-on fluorescence are of greater utility, while these
are scarce in the literature.17−25 Although there are reports for the selective recognition of TNP,
supramolecular systems such as calixarene-based ones are limited and
all of these receptors detect TNP by fluorescence quenching.26−29 Calixarenes can be easily functionalized on its upper or lower rim
to meet the requisite needed in providing complementary interacting
sites with the guest molecules.

Design and Strategy
Therefore, for
the design of such
a receptor molecule, the following aspects have been used as inputs.
Since the TNP has an aromatic moiety, it would be amenable to complex
through π···π interactions. Hence, the
pyrenyl derivatization is preferred to provide a fluorescence signal
and also to form a cup-shaped structure on the upper rim of the calix[4]arene
platform. The presence of the phenolic-OH groups at the lower rim
would ensure the cone conformation through circular hydrogen bonding.
All of these were taken into consideration in building the receptor
molecule R (Figure 1), and the synthesized R was well characterized. The ability of R for sensitive recognition of TNP has been addressed by carrying
out extensive spectroscopy and microscopy studies, and its selectivity
was further addressed by comparing the data obtained for two other
related control molecular systems (R1: tetraphenyl calix[4]arene; R2: p-pyrenyl hydroxy benzene) and also by comparing
the data related to eleven different NAC guest molecular species.
In addition, the sensing of TNP by R was demonstrated in solution,
in solid mixture, and on the surface of silica gel and cellulose paper.

Results and Discussion
Development of the Receptor (R) and the Control
Molecules (R1 and R2)
The synthesis of the designed
receptor molecule (R) having upper-rim functionalization
on calix[4]arene has been given in Scheme 1. R has been synthesized via
three steps starting from p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene (P1) and its dealkylated form (P2) followed by the upper-rim tetra-formyl functionalization
(P3) and its reaction with 1-amino pyrene. All of these
molecules were characterized by spectroscopy techniques, such as 1H and 13C NMR and electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS). The receptor R can be specifically
and selectively used as a chemosensor for the detection of TNP among
the various NACs studied. The results obtained based on R were compared with the corresponding control molecules, viz., R1, wherein a phenyl moiety is present
in place of each of the pyrene unit in R, and R2, in which no supramolecular calix platform
is present but a single unit of pyrene. The circular H-bonding present
at the lower rim is expected to maintain the cone conformation. In
the 1H NMR spectrum, two doublets for the rim CH2 protons, one at 4.52 ppm and the other at 3.85 ppm, characteristic
for the cone conformation, were observed.

Interaction
and Binding of R with TNP by Absorption
and Fluorescence Titrations
The absorption spectrum of R exhibit bands at 235, 284, and 385 nm. Upon incremental
addition of TNP to R, the absorbance at 235 and 385 nm
increases by ∼12 and ∼18%, respectively, while no change
is observed in the absorption band at 284 nm (Figure 2a). The plot of absorbance vs mole ratio
at 385 nm (inset in Figure 2a) shows sigmoidal behavior, indicating the complex formation
between R and TNP. The significant change observed in
the absorbance at 385 nm supports the interaction between TNP and
pyrenyl moieties of R. The other NACs show marginal change
in the absorbance (0–10%) upon titrating with TNP (Figure S1). The absorption spectrum of the control
molecule, R1, shows bands at
285, 325, and 435 nm. Upon titration of R1 with TNP, the absorbance of the band at 325 nm is decreased
by ∼ 82%. However, no significant change is observed in absorbance
at 435 nm (∼2%) (Figure 2b). The absorption titration of R1 with TNP exhibits a sigmoidal change in the absorbance against
mole ratio, suggesting the complex formation between R1 and TNP (inset of Figure 2b). The control molecule R2 shows absorption bands at 235, 285, and 385
nm. Upon titration of R2 with
TNP, no significant change in the absorbance of these bands is observed
(Figure 2c). The Job
plot derived from the absorption titration of R revealed
the formation of 1:1 complex between R and TNP (Figure S2). The complex formation is also supported
by ESI-MS spectra. In ESI-MS, the R gave a molecular
ion peak at m/z = 1334.47 corresponding
to [M + H]+ (Figure S12c), and
when TNP is added to this, a new molecular ion is appeared at m/z = 1564.54 corresponding to [R + TNP + H]+ (Figure 2d), supporting the formation of a 1:1 complex.

upon titration with TNP in tetrahydrofuran (THF).
The concentration of R, R1, and R2 is 4 μM
and that of TNP is 0–24 μM. (d) ESI-MS spectra for the
{R + TNP} complex, and the peak marked with the red circle
corresponds to [M + TNP + H]+. The black and red lines
correspond to the experimental and simulated isotopic peak patterns,
respectively.

The R exhibits an
emission band at 426 nm with shoulders
being present at 450 and 485 nm, which are characteristic of the pyrenyl
moieties (Figure 3a).
Upon incremental addition of TNP to R, the emission intensity
gradually increases up to >7-fold and the plot of relative emission
intensity against the mole ratio shows sigmoidal behavior, supporting
the complex formation between R and TNP (inset of Figure 3a). However, the
addition of other eleven NACs to R did not show appreciable
changes as can be observed from the histogram given in Figure 3d and Supporting Information Section S3. The data thus suggests that R can selectively sense TNP among all of the twelve NACs studied.
This can also be visualized from the photograph of the vials containing
{R + NAC} in which fluorescence enhancement is observed
only in the case of TNP under UV light (Figure S4). The control molecule R1 shows an emission band at 335 nm. With the addition of the
increasing concentration of TNP (0–6 equiv), the emission intensity
gradually increases only up to ∼2.5-fold (Figure 3b) and the plot of relative
emission intensity vs mole ratio shows a sigmoidal curve (inset of Figure 3b). However, the
addition of eleven other NACs showed only marginal enhancement (Figure 3e) and therefore R1, though forms a complex with TNP,
is unable to differentiate TNP among other NACs and hence is not an
ideal sensor for TNP. The control molecule R2 exhibits an emission band at 425 nm when excited at
367 nm. Neither the addition of TNP nor that of the other NACs shows
any significant change in the emission intensity as can be noted from Figure 3c,f. Comparison of
the fluorescence titration data of R1 with that of the R suggests that the presence
of four phenyl moieties in R1 is not sufficient to selectively sense TNP. Also, the calix[4]arene
platform is important for the selective sensing of TNP, which can
be clearly observed by comparing the emission spectra of R and R2. Hence, the presence
of the four pyrenyl moieties and a calix[4]arene platform is essential
for selective sensing of TNP. Indeed, the R has all of
these qualities over the control molecules, viz., R1 and R2;
hence, the R is selective to TNP.

TNP. The concentration of R, R1, and R2 is 4
μM, and the concentration of TNP is varied from 0 to 24 μM.
The inset in each case shows the plot of relative emission intensity

The emission spectra in the case of R and R2 were recorded in THF, and a mixture of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and THF (1:99 v/v) was used in the case
of R1.

The association constant (Ka) and limit
of detection (LOD) obtained from fluorescence spectral titration data
of R with TNP are (3.66 ± 0.07) × 104 M–1 and (1.54 ± 0.05) μM or (0.35 ±
0.01) ppm, respectively (Figures S5 and S6). The quantum yields of R and {R + TNP}
are 0.004 and 0.027, respectively, with respect to the quinine sulfate
used as standard (Figure S7). The competitive
fluorescence titration studies show that the presence of other eleven
NACs does not interfere with the selectivity of R to
sense TNP and that the fluorescence enhancement is ∼7–9-fold
(Figure 4a) when TNP
is added to R. The complexation of TNP to R has also been proven based on the isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) data. The ITC data shows the best fit for one-site binding (Figure 4b). The overall heat
of the reaction was exothermic, and TNP binds with an association
constant (Ka) of (1.16 ± 0.02) ×
105, suggesting a strong binding of TNP by R. Since the ΔS value is small and negative
and the ΔH is large, the ΔG for complexation becomes negative, showing its feasibility.

Fluxional Behavior of R by 1H NMR Spectroscopy
The broad features observed in the room temperature (RT) 1H NMR spectrum suggest fluxional behavior for the receptor molecule R, which has been ascertained by measuring 1H NMR
spectra from RT down to −40 °C in CDCl3. 1H NMR spectral traces obtained in this temperature range are
overlaid in Figure 5 for comparison. At room temperature, the R shows broad
peaks corresponding to the pyrene protons as well as the phenyl ring
protons of the calix core. Upon lowering the temperature of the sample,
all of these broad peaks were sharpened and split, suggesting the
presence of more than one conformation. This can be easily understood
from the spectra obtained in the temperature range of −20 to
−40 °C. The presence of more than one conformer is also
understood from the bridged −CH2 proton pattern
observed by lowering the temperature.

spectra of R at (i) 25; (ii) 15; (iii) 0; (iv) −10;

TNP Binding by R Using 1H NMR Titration
1H NMR titrations were
performed to support the binding
of TNP to R. During the titration, the concentration
of R was kept constant and the [TNP]/[R]
mole ratio was increased. Upon gradual addition of TNP to R, the broad peaks observed for the pyrene protons in the range 7.6–8.8
ppm starts sharpening and splitting, thereby suggesting that TNP interacts
with the pyrene moieties, and as a result, the flexibility of the
arms at the upper rim is hindered (Figure 6). Even the peaks corresponding to the phenyl
moiety (∼7.4 ppm) of the calix platform are sharpened, supporting
the fact that the flexibility of the calix rim is dampened. The spectral
sharpening obtained for {R + TNP} is reminiscent of the
low temperature spectrum obtained for R. The sharpening
of the peaks upon addition of TNP further supports that the flexibility
of the pyrene arms is reduced upon addition of TNP due to the binding
of TNP through π..π interactions, and the presence of
such interactions was delineated by the density functional theory
(DFT) computational studies as given in this paper. When a similar
titration was carried out between R1 and TNP (Figure 7), the 1H NMR spectra showed no significant sharpening
even at one equivalent addition of TNP, supporting the fact that there
is no considerable interaction present between the phenyl moieties
in R1 and TNP, unlike that observed
between R and TNP.

the titration of R with 0–1 equiv (i to vi) of
TNP in DMSO-d6. TNP shows only one peak
at 8.32 ppm.

Sensing of TNP by R in the Solid State
The sensing of TNP by R in the solid state was studied
by fluorescence microscopy. Based on the solution studies, R was shown to selectively sense TNP among other NACs. To understand
the utility of R in the detection of TNP in its powder
form, the fluorescence microscopy measurements were carried out in
the ground mixture of R and TNP. The R alone
shows feeble blue fluorescence emission. Upon addition of increasing
equivalents of TNP, the intensity of blue fluorescence gradually increases,
as can be seen from Figure 8a–f, and at the highest equivalents, it shows ∼6-fold
enhancement (Figure 8k). The limit of detection of TNP in the solid state by R is 2.1 micromole (Figure S8). Similar
experiments carried out with the control molecules, viz., R1 and R2, showed no significant change in the fluorescence intensity even
after mixing 5 equiv of TNP (Figure 8g–j,l). Thus, TNP can be selectively sensed
by R even in the solid state just by grinding both the
components together without using any solvent.

(I/I0) for (i) R, (ii) R1, and (iii) R2 upon grinding with 5 equiv of TNP.
The black bars correspond to the controls measured without TNP.

Sensing of TNP by R on Silica
Gel and on Cellulose
Paper Strips
The fluorescence intensity of the receptor (R) increases in the presence of TNP as shown in solution and
in the solid powder. To demonstrate its sensitivity on a silica gel
strip, the strips were drop-casted with R followed by
adding the THF solution of TNP (0–6 equiv) and the fluorescence
spectra were measured. With increasing concentration of TNP, the intensity
of the emission band at 425 nm gradually increases, as can be seen
from Figure 9a. The
plot of I/I0 versus mole
ratio shows a maximum 8-fold fluorescence enhancement (Figure 9c), which is marginally greater
than that observed even in the solution phase owing to the orientation
of R on the silica surface as shown in Figure 9e. Similar experiments were carried out using
cellulose paper strips. In the case of the cellulose paper, the emission
maximum of R is red-shifted by 10 nm as compared to the
same on the silica gel strip owing to the variation in the nature
of the surface interactions present in these two cases; however, the
enhancement in the fluorescence intensity is the same (Figure 9b,d). The lowest detection
limits of TNP are 3.5 and 6.5 μM, respectively, in the case
of silica gel and cellulose paper (Figure S8).

Sensing of TNP in Different Sources of Water
To demonstrate
a real sample application of the probe molecules R to
sense TNP, water samples were collected from different sources, such
as ground, rain, sea, Milli-Q, and distilled water, and were spiked
with TNP (50 μM). The fluorescence spectra were recorded for
all of these water samples spiked with TNP. R shows enhancement
in fluorescence by ∼3.5–4-fold in all of the cases (Figures 10a and S9), showing that it is possible to extend the
application potential of R to real water samples.

of water and (b) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at different
pH values. The red bar corresponds to the intensity of R, and the blue bar corresponds to that of {R + TNP}.
Herein, [R] = 10 μM and [TNP] = 50 μM.

Influence of pH on TNP Sensing
The
influence of pH
on sensing TNP by R has been demonstrated in PBS buffer
at pH values ranging from 3 to 12. Across this pH range, the fluorescence
enhancement is almost comparable and lies in the range of ∼3–4.5-fold
(Figure 10b), supporting
the fact that the R can be used in a wide range of conditions for
sensing TNP.

TNP-Induced Changes in the Supramolecular
Features by Microscopy
To study the changes induced in the
microscopy features of R upon interaction with TNP, scanning
electron microscopy
(SEM) study was performed. R exhibits spherical particle-like
morphology of diameter (272 ± 42) nm (Figure 11a). The addition of TNP leads to the aggregation
of these particles to give long chainlike aggregates as evident from
the SEM micrographs shown in Figure 11d. The size of the particles present in these chains
is reduced by one-third to give (98 ± 22) nm. The control molecule R1 shows twisted elongated fiberlike
features, which form bundles upon addition of TNP (Figure 11b,e). R2 also showed fibril-like features, which were further
bundled to give twisted ropelike structures upon interaction with
TNP (Figure 11c,f).

The scale bars in nm are as follows: for (m), (n), (p), and (q), 100,
and for (o) and (r), 500. The concentration of R, R1, and R2 is 100 μM and that of TNP is 500 μM, both in CHCl3.

The results observed in AFM and
TEM agree well with those observed
in SEM. Thus, the spherical particles of R aggregate
in the presence of TNP as observed in both AFM and TEM. Even in the
case of R1 and R2, the density of the fibrils increases considerably
upon interaction with TNP as observed from AFM and TEM (Figure 11g–r). All
of the microscopy data reveal that the supramolecular features of R, R1, and R2 exhibit recognizable changes in their morphology
upon interaction with TNP as proven based on SEM, AFM, and TEM.

Complexation of R and TNP by Computational Studies
All of the DFT, molecular dynamics (MD), and ONIOM computational
calculations were performed as per the details given in the Experimental Section, and the sequence of these
operations can be noted from Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Flowchart Showing the Steps Followed for the Computational
Calculations
Carried Out for Interaction of R with TNP
The optimized structure for R and TNP were
used to
build a model structure for its 1:1 complex, which was subjected to
10 ns MD simulations from which 22 trajectories were manually selected
by keeping the experimental outcome in mind and their complexation
energies (CEs) were varied from −35 to −51 kcal/mol
as obtained based on single-point calculations. These 22 structures
were subjected to ONIOM calculations, which resulted in the convergence
in the case of 17 structures that are similar in nature. All of these
17 structures showed CEs in the range −40 to −46 kcal/mol,
where the highest complexation energy was observed with the structure
obtained from the frame of 3984. The final structure obtained from
this frame is shown in Figure 12 and was further analyzed for the interactions present
between R and TNP. Figure 12 clearly supports that TNP is sandwiched between two consecutive
pyrene moieties labeled as “B” and “C”.
The corresponding centroid-to-centroid distances between TNP and the
pyrene moieties (B and C) are 3.300 and 3.317 Å, respectively,
supporting the presence of strong π···π
interactions between the pyrenes and the TNP. In addition, “O”
of one of the ortho-nitro groups interacts with the π face of
one of the other two pyrene rings with a O···π
distance of 3.029 Å. Even after the complexation of R by TNP,
all of the four lower-rim phenolic-OH···O hydrogen
bonds (Table 1) were
retained, supporting the cone conformation for the calix[4]arene platform.

Conclusions and Comparisons
Sensing
of TNP by R in Solution, in the Solid State,
and on the Surface of Silica Gel and Cellulose Paper
An upper-rim-derivatized
calix[4] arene with a tetrapyrene moiety (R) has been
synthesized in three steps and demonstrated for its selective detection
of trinitrophenol (TNP). The control molecules R1 and R2 have
also been synthesized to prove that the design of the receptor molecule R possessing tetrapyrenyl groups at the upper rim and the
calix[4]arene platform in the cone conformation is essential for sensing
TNP. Upon interaction with TNP, the fluorescence emission is enhanced
by >7-fold in the case of R, while it is much lower
in
the case of R1 and R2, supporting the fact that the presence
of the calix[4]arene platform and the pyrenyl moieties at the upper
rim is essential for sensitive detection. The TNP can be distinguished
from other NACs only in the case of R and not in the
case of R1 and R2 by fluorescence emission study. This provides
clear-cut differentiation between the role of the receptor molecule
versus that of the control ones. The binding of TNP is proven by ITC
and the rigidity of R upon TNP binding by 1H NMR. The details of the complexation between R and
TNP were computed by the computational calculations, and it was observed
that this results in a host–guest complexation via trapping
the TNP between the two consecutive pyrenyl moieties by π···π
interactions, which is expected to restrict the flexibility of the
pyrenyl arms. The interaction of R is also studied in
the solid powder mixture by fluorescence microscopy and on the surface
of silica gel and cellulose paper by fluorescence spectroscopy. The
complexation of TNP by R shows fluorescence enhancement
irrespective of whether the interaction is in solution, powder mixture,
or on the surface of silica gel or on cellulose. However, the limit
of detection in each of these cases differs and is 1.5, 3.5, and 6.5
μM, respectively, in solution, silica gel strips, and cellulose
paper, and is 2.1 μmole in the solid powder mixture (Figure 13c). Even the naked
eye detection of TNP on the R-coated silica gel strips
gives a detection limit of 21.5 μM (Figure 13a,b) as can be noticed from the picture
taken under UV light using a cellular phone.

Comparison between R and the
Literature Reports
on Calixarenes as Sensors for TNP
Calixarene-based chemosensors
reported in the literature for sensing TNP are given in Table 2. This table clearly reveals
that all of these sensors function through fluorescence quenching
and the studies are mostly in the organic solvents. Only the calixarene-based
conjugate reported in this paper shows fluorescence enhancement upon
addition of TNP, while the binding strength and the detection limits
are comparable with those reported in the literature. To our knowledge,
ours is the first example where the sensing of TNP is shown under
four different conditions, viz., solution, powder mixture, silica
gel surface, and cellulose surface.

Role of Chemical and Structural Features in Selective Sensing
of NAC
Based on an earlier study from our group, we have
reported an upper-rim benzimadazole derivative (L) that
is selective to TNT over TNP and also several other NACs.30 The similarity between L and the
present receptor R is the imine moiety that is being
fixed in a five-membered ring in L (resulting in an imidazole
moiety), while it is free in R, but both have aromatic
moieties that differ in their size. These differences resulted in
a cup-shaped structure in the case of L, and it expands
in the presence of three TNT guest species where each TNT interacts
with one benzimidazole moiety through weak π···π
interactions in addition to H-bonding between the O of the nitro group
and the −NH of the imidazole moiety. On the other hand, in
the case of R, the pyrene moieties enjoy free rotation
to adjust their conformation and lead to a rigid structure upon binding
by TNP. The rigidity arises from the binding of TNP since both the
adjacent pyrene moieties exhibit stronger π···π
interactions. As the present receptor R lacks an imidazole
−NH, the R is deprived of extending H-bonding
interactions with the guest NAC. All of these chemical followed by
structural differences present between L and R lead to the diversity in the selective sensing of NACs (Figure 14); while it is
TNT in the case of L, it is TNP in the case of R, wherein both these cases are guided by the specific interactions.

In this paper, we have shown that
the TNP sensing can be performed
in solution, the solid state, or on oxophilic surfaces, such as silica
gel or cellulose paper, and all of the events can be monitored by
a cellular phone for taking the images and by software ImageJ for
processing the data. Therefore, there exists a wide scope for the
utility of R in the sensitive and selective detection
of TNP present in the samples collected from different sources where
the image handling and the data management are trivial.

Absorption and Fluorescence Studies of R with NACs
Absorption and fluorescence titrations
were carried out using tetrahydrofuran
(THF). All of the titrations were carried out in a 1 cm quartz cell,
and the concentration of R, R1, or R2 was kept
constant at 4 μM. The concentrations of NACs were varied from
0 to 24 μM. The twelve different NACs used in the present study
are nitrobenzene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 3-nitrotoluene, 4-nitrotoluene,
1,3-dinitrotoluene, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 3-nitrophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol,
2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), o-nitro chlorobenzene, p-nitro benzoic acid, and p-nitro aniline.
The absorption spectra were measured in the range 200–800 nm,
and the fluorescence spectra were measured in the range 377–800
nm. The competitive fluorescence titration of R in the
presence of other NACs was also performed for sensitive detection
of TNP.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
The ITC experiment
was carried out on a MicroCal isothermal microcalorimeter (Northampton).
The receptor R was dissolved in THF to give a concentration
of 0.5 mM, and 300 μL of this was taken in the reaction cell.
For the titration, the TNP solution of 2 mM in THF was taken in the
syringe. The titration was performed for 20 injections with 2 μL
per injection at a time interval of 150–200 s at 25 °C.
The data were fitted using the built-in software.

Sample Preparation
for Microscopy Studies
For all of
the studies, 100 μM R, R1, and R2 were
mixed with 5 equiv of TNP in CHCl3 and drop-casted on a
silicon substrate (in the case of SEM and AFM) and on a copper grid
(in the case of TEM) and dried under an IR lamp. As a control, samples
of only R, R1, and R2 were also prepared in the same
manner. In the case of SEM, the samples were analyzed after sputtering
for 30 s at 10 mA current.

Fluorescence Microscopy of the Powder Mixture
The samples
were prepared by grinding 3 mg of R with different molar
ratios of TNP, i.e., 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 4, and 5, separately in mortar–pestle.
Similarly R1 and R2 were also ground with 1:5 molar ratio of
TNP separately as a control. All of the samples were observed by a
fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S) using a blue filter.
The mean fluorescence intensities were measured using NIS-Elements
BR analysis software, which is a built-in software with the microscope.

Fluorescence Spectral Study of Samples on Silica and Cellulose
Paper
Silica gel and cellulose paper strips were cut into
1 ×3 cm2 size strips, and the volume of 10 μL
of R (20 μM) in THF was drop-casted on the center
point marked at the beginning of the experiment. Ten microliters of
increasing concentration of TNP (0–6 equiv) in THF was then
drop-casted on these points. The fluorescence intensity of each strip
was measured in the 377–800 nm range while the excitation is
fixed at 367 nm.

A long silica gel strip of 2 × 20 cm2 was cut from a larger plate, and nine points were marked
at equidistance. A volume of 5 μL of R (50 μM)
was drop-casted on each of these nine points. Thereafter, a volume
of 5 μL of increasing concentration of TNP (0–5 equiv)
was drop-casted on the same marked points starting from left to right.
The silica gel strip was photographed using a cell phone under UV
illumination. The intensity profiling was done using ImageJ software
by subtracting the background of UV light.

Fluorescence Spectral Study
of TNP in Different Sources of Water
The water samples were
collected from different sources, such as
ground, rain, sea, Milli-Q, and distilled water and were spiked with
TNP (50 μM). The fluorescence spectra were recorded for all
of these water samples spiked with TNP in which R (10 μM) was
added.

pH Variation Studies
The R and TNP were
dissolved separately in THF initially to prepare stock solutions of
1 and 5 mM, respectively. Then, R and TNP solutions were
taken into PBS buffer at different pH values (3 to 12) to obtain their
final concentrations of 10 and 50 μM, respectively. The fluorescence
spectra for R and {R + TNP} were recorded
in the PBS buffer at different pH values to study the fluorescence
response for sensing TNP by R as a function of pH. The
pH was adjusted using 5 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS).

Computational
Details
The initial model structure for
the receptor R was prepared starting from a known crystal
structure31 as per the steps given in Figure S15. The geometry optimization of this
model structure for R was carried out in a cascade fashion,
viz., initially with PM6 followed by the range-separated functional
wB97XD in combination with the double-ζ quality basis set like
6-31G(d,p).32,33

For the MD simulation study,
an automated topology builder34 has been
used to generate the force fields for the receptor R and
TNP from the obtained equilibrium coordinates at the wB97XD/6-31G(d,p)
level of geometry optimization. After obtaining the force field, the
gas phase MD simulations for the 1:1 complex {R···TNP}
were initiated by placing TNP in the close proximity of R in different orientations.35 Both these
initial structures lead to similar final conformation for 10 ns simulations
as can be noticed from Figure S16. Thus,
for further analysis, only one complex, where TNP is
kept at the center of the R, has been considered.

The {R···TNP} complex thus generated
was subjected to 10 ns MD simulations using 2 fs time steps as performed
through the GROMACS 4.6.7 version.36 The
resultant trajectories were recorded at a regular interval of 2 fs
during the simulations. We employed the microcanonical ensemble (N.V.E.)
to represent the R···TNP complex, where
the N, V, and E stands for the number of molecules, volume, and energy respectively.
These are used to study the structural and dynamic features of the
{R···TNP} complexes. In the MD simulations,
the R is trapped between two consecutive pyrene rings
and stays intact till the end of the simulation as can be seen from Figure S17. Among these, a total of 22 structurally
distinct trajectories/conformations for the {R···TNP}
complex were further subjected to the single-point energy calculation
at the wB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. Figure S18 is a representation for the variation of different complexation
energies (CEs).

The complexation energy (CE) varies from −35
to −51
kcal/mol among these 22 trajectories, of which the trajectory obtained
at a time step of 3984 exhibits the highest value of −51 kcal/mol.
All of these 22 structures have similar structural and energetic features,
where TNP is sandwiched between the two consecutive pyrene rings.
All of these 22 structures were further subjected to two layered ONIOM
calculations,37 where the upper rim layer
is treated at the wB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level and the lower rim layer
is treated with the semiempirical method, PM6, using GAUSSIAN 09 software
packages.38 Among the 22 structures, only
17 structures were converged, and these are further improved with
6-311G(d,p), a triple-ζ quality basis set, and BSSE corrections.39 The CE calculated from the super molecular approach
is obtained from the wB97XD/6-311G(d,p)//ONIOM(wB97XD/6-31G(d,p):PM6)
level. At this stage, the CEs vary in the range −40 to −46
kcal/mol. Thus, based on the MD simulations and DFT studies, the {R···TNP} complex obtained from the 3984 frame
of the MD simulations was considered and discussed in the Results and Discussion section.
