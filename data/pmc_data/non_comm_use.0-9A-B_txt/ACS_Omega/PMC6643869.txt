Hydrogen
production by water splitting and the removal of aqueous
dyes by using a catalyst and solar energy are an ideal future energy
source and useful for environmental protection. Graphitic carbon nitride
can be used as the photocatalyst with visible light irradiation. However,
it typically suffers from the high recombination of carriers and low
electrical conductivity. Here, we have developed a facile mix-thermal
strategy to prepare carbon black-modified graphitic carbon nitrides,
which possess high electrical conductivity, a wide adsorption range
of visible light, and a low recombination rate of carriers. With the
help of carbon black, highly crystallized graphitic carbon nitrides
with built-in triazine and heptazine heterojunctions are obtained.
Improved photocatalytic activities have been achieved in carbon black-modified
graphitic carbon nitride. The dye removal rate can be three times
faster than that of pristine graphitic carbon nitride and the photocatalytic
H2 generation is 234 μmol h–1 g–1 under visible light irradiation.

1 Introduction
Clean
hydrogen generation from water splitting with sunlight plays
an important role in developing sustainable green energy. Three factors
are crucial to achieving highly efficient photocatalysts: namely,
an appropriate band gap to absorb maximum solar radiations, high electrical
conductivity, and a low recombination rate of carriers.1 In addition, the materials should be nontoxic,
abundant, and easily processable into desired shapes. To date, various
oxide,2,3 sulfide,4,5 and oxynitride6,7 semiconductors have been applied as photocatalysts. However, they
typically suffer from the limited concentration of active sites and
the toxicity of heavy metals. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely studied for photocatalytic water splitting
and organic pollutant degradation due to its chemical and thermal
stability and nontoxicity. However, the efficiency of pristine g-C3N4 under visible light is relatively low due to
the marginal absorption of visible light and grain boundary effects.8 Creation of heterojunctions with other semiconductors
is a feasible strategy to promote the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.9 Moreover, attempts
to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 have also focused on heteroatom doping with S,10,11 Ag,12−15 K,16 C,17,18 and P,18,19 which result in the modification of the electronic structure and
therefore improvement of the photocatalytic performance. Nevertheless,
heteroatom doping entails a relatively high cost with the complicated
process. Moreover, some heavy metal dopants probably leak out from
the catalyst, causing additional pollutants.

Due to the high
electronic transportability, carbon allotropes
(e.g., carbon quantum dots,17 graphene20,21) are optimal materials to accelerate electron transfer from the
g-C3N4 photocatalyst, to improve its separation
of electron–hole pairs and to enhance the photocatalytic activity.
In addition, amorphous g-C3N4 with a disordered
structure and an increased surface area has been reported numerously
in improving the photocatalytic activity.22−26 Nevertheless, there are limited reports on g-C3N4 with high crystallinity and condensation and
at the same time with improved photocatalytic activity. Herein, with
the introduction of carbon black (CB), we succeeded in a one-step
facile mix-thermal strategy to obtain highly crystalline g-C3N4. The triazine and (tri-s-triazine)
heptazine phases of g-C3N4 are generated simultaneously
and the efficient heterostructure is built between them in the g-C3N4 matrix. According to the literature, a conjugated
heterostructure is also built in carbon nitride when it is prepared
from a high-nitrogen-content precursor.27 Benefiting from the high surface area-to-volume ratio and being
an excellent electricity conductor, the heterostructure has high electrical
conductivity, a wide adsorption range of visible light, and a low
recombination rate of carriers, and therefore displays high photocatalytic
activity. In this study, we describe several such materials made from
the pyrolysis of urea mixed with CB, during which both crystallinity
and condensation degrees of g-C3N4 are improved.
The prepared CB-modified g-C3N4 shows excellent
photocatalytic activities, including a higher methylene blue (MB)
removal ratio of 70.2% as compared with pristine g-C3N4 (26.5%) and a higher photocatalytic H2 evolution
rate of 234 μmol h–1 g–1 compared with pristine g-C3N4 (163 μmol
h–1 g–1) under visible light irradiation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure and Composition
of Photocatalysts
Figure 1a shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine g-C3N4 and CB-modified g-C3N4. The peak at
around 13° corresponds to the (100) diffraction plane, which
indicates the in-plane repeated units of tri-s-triazine.
For 1500CNC and 3000CNC, peaks at around 18° can be indexed to
the (100) peak for the triazine phase in the modified g-C3N4.28,29 Therefore, the XRD patterns for nCNCs reflect the coexistence of triazine and (tri-s-triazine) heptazine phases in g-C3N4 after the CB modification. The peaks at around 27° can be indexed
to the (002) diffraction plane in the c-axis, which
represents the periodic graphitic stacking of the conjugated system
with an interlayer distance around 0.3 nm.10,30 The (002) and (100) peaks for the tri-s-triazine
phase are more intense and sharper when CB is introduced in the condensation
of urea, which suggests that the crystallinity of g-C3N4 is improved after the CB modification. Therefore, in this
work, g-C3N4 with the triazine and (tri-s-triazine) heptazine heterojunction is built in a one-pot
synthesis with the help of CB (Figure S1 shows XRD patterns for CNC with different urea and CB ratios). Moreover,
both (100) and (002) peaks shift to the higher degree for 1500CNC
and 3000CNC as compared with that of CN, indicating narrower intralayer
and interlayer distances. The interlayer distances of aromatic units
from the (002) peak are listed in Table S1. Note that most reported dopants in the C–N cycles result
in an increase of the interlayer distance due to the larger atomic
radius.16 Nevertheless, the decrease of
the intralayer and interlayer distance in our nCNCs
is presumably caused by the covalent bonding between interlayer dopant
carbon atoms and the C, N on the aromatic rings.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of CN,
1500CNC and 3000CNC; (b) Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of CN and 1500CNC and 3000CNC.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for
the CN and CNC
samples are shown in Figure 1b. CNCs and CN display a similar FTIR pattern, indicating
that the introduction of CB does not alter the basic chemical structure
of CN. The slightly broader vibration bands at around 3200 cm–1 indicate a complex environment for the O–H
and N–H stretching vibrations on the edges of g-C3N4 layers, suggesting more compact interlayer interaction.29 The vibration bands at 1000–1750 cm–1 are attributed to the CN stretching vibrations in
the CN heterocycles.31 The strong band
at 810 cm–1 is ascribed to the vibration mode of
the triazine-based unit. The comparison of all nCNCs
is provided in Figure S2.

The X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were used to
determine the compositions and chemical states of the constituents
in the samples. The CN and nCNCs mainly consist of
C and N elements with a small amount of oxygen as shown in the survey
spectra in Figure S3. The higher atomic
concentration of C in 3000CNC and 1500CNC suggests the successful
doping of CB in 3000CNC and 1500CNC.

Figure 2a–c
are the high-resolution spectra of C, N, and O, respectively. In Figure 2a, all samples exhibit
two bonding states of carbon species, which are evident with the C
1s binding energies of around 284.6 and 289 eV. In Figure 2b, the main peaks of N 1s binding
energies are located around 399 and 401 eV for all samples. The broader
N 1s, C 1s binding energy areas for samples 3000CNC and 1500CNC as
compared with CN imply the complex bonding types, indicating the formation
of a mixture of crystalline phases of g-C3N4. The higher O 1s bonding energy for samples 3000CNC and 1500CNC
implies that the absorbed O2 and surface −OH and
C=O generated on the edge of the CN cycle are located in a
more intense chemical environment (Figure 2c,f). The high-resolution C 1s XPS spectrum
of sample 1500CNC in Figure 2d shows three deconvolution peaks at 289.0, 286.2, and 284.6
eV, reflecting sp2-bonded carbon (N–C=N),
C–O, and graphitic carbon (C–C), respectively. Figure 2e shows the peak
deconvolution of the N 1s XPS spectrum for 1500CNC. Three peaks at
399.2, 400.7, and 401.6 eV are ascribed to sp2-hybridized
aromatic N bonded to carbon atoms (C=N–C), the tertiary
N bonded to carbon atoms in the form of N–(C)3,
and N–H side groups, respectively.31 Both the binding energies of sp2-bonded C and N shift
to higher energies for 3000CNC and 1500CNC as compared with CN and
reported g-C3N4.32 The higher binding energy presumably comes from the incorporation
of intercalated CB and the CN heterocycles. CB in the g-C3N4 matrix bonds with adjacent C and N atoms, which results
in the increase of the bonding energy in the in-plane triazine and/or
heptazine units. On the other hand, the bonding force from the graphitic
interlayer is supposed to drag the g-C3N4 layers
and to make them into more compact layers. This hypothesis from XPS
results is consistent with the shrinking of the crystal lattice space
for g-C3N4 as confirmed by the XRD (Tables 1 and S1). The shifted XRD and XPS patterns have also
been reported in other elemental modifications of g-C3N4.16,19

2.2 Microstructures and Texture Properties of
Photocatalysts
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
morphologies of 1500CNC and CN are presented in Figure 3a–d, respectively. Both samples exhibit
the typical layered platelet-like surface morphology with wrinkling
edges, where 1500CNC has more compact and intact flakes. On the contrary,
CN possesses interstitial pores at the edge of the flakes. The porous
structure of CN is generated due to the release of various gases during
the pyrolysis of urea, including NH3, CO2, H2O, etc. For 1500CNC, CB is assumed to exert its absorption
property, accommodating the gases generated during the heating process.
Moreover, it serves as the condensation site for the generated intermediate
gases. Therefore, 1500CNC is more intact and compact than CN, corresponding
to the N2 adsorption–desorption results. As shown
in Table 1, CN and
1500CNC have specific surface areas (SSAs) of 128.6 and 54.9 m2 g–1, respectively. However, 1500CNC has
a higher surface area-to-volume ratio (3.6 × 106 cm–1) than CN (2.2 × 106 cm–1).

Figure 3 TEM images for 1500CNC (a) and CN (b); high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
images with inset selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns
for 1500CNC (c) and CN (d).

The crystalline characteristics of both samples are also
characterized
by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED), which are shown
in insets in Figure 3c,d. Both SAED patterns show a full outer diffraction ring, which
can be indexed as the (002) reflection of g-C3N4, and an inner weak diffraction ring, which can be indexed as the
reflection of the (100) plane from g-C3N4, indicating
that both samples consist of extremely small crystallites with random
orientation. The clearer SAED pattern for 1500CNC than for CN suggests
the improved crystallinity, which is consistent with the XRD data.

The adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure S4) for all samples are type IV (BDDT Classification),
suggesting the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm).33 The hysteresis loops are type H3 (IUPAC classification),
indicating the formation of slit-shaped pores from the aggregates
of plate-like particles.34,35 Overall, the SSAs and
pore volumes are less for nCNCs compared with CN.
Since 1500CNC and CN have a similar particle size based on the TEM,
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) results indicate that nCNCs should be more compact than CN, which is due to the
improved condensation degree of urea resulting from the CB modification.
The SSAs and pore volumes (listed in Table 1) decrease with an increase in the amount
of CB. However, with further increase in the CB amount, the SSAs and
pore volume gradually increase. A small amount of dopant is supposed
to improve the polymerization. However, further increase in the amount
of CB will result in a higher surface area of nCNCs
due to the excess porous CB. nCNCs also exhibit superior
thermostability compared with pristine g-C3N4. The thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry analysis
(TG-DSC) for photocatalysts is shown in Figure S5.

2.3 Optical and Electrical
Properties
UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra
(DRS) of the
obtained g-C3N4 samples are presented in Figure 4a. CB-modified g-C3N4 and pristine CN show typical absorption patterns
of semiconductors with absorption edges at ∼445 nm, indicating
that samples can absorb solar energy in the blue-light region.36 The incorporation of CB into the g-C3N4 matrix increases the UV–vis absorption over
the entire wavelength range. The absorption tail in the longer wavelength
has been reported in most doped CN.37,38 Moreover,
its intensity increases along with the amount of CB (Figures 4a and S6). The bandgap energies for all of the photocatalysts are
in the range of 2.70–3.00 eV as presented in Figures 4b and S6, and listed in Table 1. 3000CNC has the largest band gap, which can be ascribed
to the change in the valence band of g-C3N4 due
to the increased bonding energy in in-plane units. It has been calculated
and predicted that seven phases of C3N4 exist,
which are α-C3N4, ß-C3N4, cubic C3N4, pseudocubic C3N4, g-h-triazine, g-o-triazine, and g-h-heptazine,
with bandgap values of 5.49, 4.85, 4.30, 4.13, 2.97, 0.93, and 2.88
eV, respectively.39,40 As we can see, the band gap for
3000CNC is 2.95 eV (between 2.97 and 2.88 eV), indicating the mixture
phases of g-C3N4 with triazine and heptazine
(tri-s-triazine). The CB in the matrix leads to the
formation of more sub-band states in the band gap,17 which results in the decrease in the band gap.

diffuse reflectance spectra and (b) estimated
bandgap energies of CN, 3000CNC, and 1500CNC; (c) photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of CN, 3000CNC, 1500CNC, 1000CNC, 200CNC, and 600CNC;
(d) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of CN, CB, and 3000CNC;
(e) XPS valence band spectra (a and b refer to CN and 3000CNC, respectively);
(f) band structures of CN and 3000CNC.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Figure 4c) are usually used as an indication of the
recombination or separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge
carriers.41 A faster recombination of electron–hole
results in a more intense PL spectrum.42 All of the samples show only one dominant luminescence peak. This
strong peak at 450 nm for pristine CN is attributed to the near-band-edge
emission, which is related to the direct recombination of excitons
through an exciton–exciton collision process.43 The intensity of the emission peak appreciably decreases
when g-C3N4 is modified with a small amount
of CB, such as 3000CNC and 1500CNC. A comparative study of the overall
intensity of all samples indicates a substantial inhibition of charge
carriers’ recombination in the samples 3000CNC and 1500CNC.
Low intensities of PL for 1000CNC, 600CNC, and 200CNC can be ascribed
to the absorption of incident light by the extra CB. The photocatalytic
activity is related to the concentration of free charge carriers generated
in the photocatalytic process. Therefore, 3000CNC and 1500CNC are
relatively effective for the separation of charge carriers, indicating
the potentially higher photocatalytic activity.

In addition,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement
was used to investigate the charge transfer resistance and the separation
efficiency of the photoinduced charge carriers. Figure 4d demonstrates the diameter of the Nyquist
semicircle for the 3000CNC, CN, and CB electrodes. The Nyquist plot
semicircle of 3000CNC is located between those of pristine CN and
CB. A small arc radius implies a high efficiency of charge transfer
and separation.30,44 Therefore, the EIS measurement
is consistent with PL spectra, indicating that CB-modified g-C3N4 has an enhanced separation and transfer efficiency
of charge carriers.

2.4 Adsorption and Photocatalytic
Activities of
Catalysts
The photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples
were evaluated by monitoring the degradation of methylene blue (MB)
and Orange II sodium salt (OrgII) solution under visible light irradiation
(wavelength ≥ 400 nm). The adsorption equilibrium was established
in 1 h before the photocatalytic test. Compared with CN, the adsorption
properties of nCNCs are improved for cationic dye
MB (Figure 5A), but
inferior for anionic dye OrgII (Figure 5B). Although with the highest SSA and pore volume,
due to the positive charge,34 pristine
g-C3N4 shows an inferior adsorption toward cationic
dye MB. Exceptionally, 200CNC exhibited substantial adsorption toward
both MB and OrgII, which can be attributed to the amount of existing
CB in the g-C3N4 matrix.

Figure 5 Comparison of MB (A)
and OrgII (B) adsorption and photodegradation
in water under visible light over CN and nCNCs; first-order
kinetic plots for the photodegradation of MB (C) and OrgII (D) over
CN and nCNCs.

The MB removal ratios are 63.3, 70.2, and 26.5% on 1500CNC,
200CNC,
and CN, respectively. However, the OrgII removal ratios are 80.1,
50.1, and 87.8% on 3000CNC, 1500CNC, and CN, respectively. The photodegradation
experimental data are fitted by a first-order kinetic model as expressed
by the equation ln(C/C0) = −kt, with the value of the rate constant k giving an indication of the activity of the photocatalysts
(listed in Table 1).45 The photoactivity has been improved obviously
for the degradation of MB over nCNCs, with the highest k value of 3.05 × 10–3 min–1 for 3000CNC (Figure 5C). Although CN still exhibits superior removal toward OrgII, 3000CNC
suppresses it in photocatalytic activity with the highest k value of 6.07 × 10–3 min–1 (Figure 5D). The
UV–vis absorption spectra of the MB solution and OrgII solution
after different periods of adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition
are illustrated Figure S7.

We also
conducted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from the water
splitting for 3000CNC and CN under visible light (λ ≥
420 nm) irradiation (Figure S8). In our
system, electron donor triethanolamine (TEOA) works as a sacrifice
to accelerate the hole oxidation process.46 In situ photodeposited Pt acts as a cocatalyst to accelerate the
surface electron transfer and hydrogen reduction, promoting photocatalytic
activity.47 The total hydrogen production
of 3000CNC after 6 h reaction is 14.03 μmol, which is 1.4 times
higher than that of CN (9.82 μmol). The H2 generation
rate of 3000CNC reaches 234 μmol h–1 g–1, which is higher than that of CN (163 μmol
h–1 g–1). Therefore, 3000CNC not
only exhibits superior photocatalytic oxidation but also higher photocatalytic
reduction than CN.

2.5 Proposed Mechanism under
Visible Light Irradiation
It is accepted that •OH, •O2– and photogenerated holes
are the main reactive species
in photocatalytic oxidation, which are determined by the surface redox
potential of the photocatalyst. The XPS valence band spectra of CN
and 3000CNC are shown in Figure 4e. The valence band maxima (VBM) of CN and 3000CNC
are 1.45 and 1.78 eV, respectively. The higher VBM value suggests
a stronger oxidation of the photogenerated holes in 3000CNC. Considering
that the band gaps of CN and 3000CNC are 2.89 and 2.95 eV (Figure 4b), the conduction
band minima (CBM) are located at −1.44 and −1.17 eV,
respectively. Therefore, the band structures of CN and 3000CNC are
as provided in Figure 4f. The potential energies of the VBM for both CN and 3000CNC are
lower than those of OH–/•OH (1.99
eV), whereas the potential energy of CBM is more negative than that
of O2/•O2– (−0.28
eV). Therefore, the photogenerated holes cannot directly oxidize OH– into hydroxyl radicals •OH, whereas
the electrons can reduce the O2 into superoxide radicals •O2–. Hence, the main reactive species
in the photocatalytic degradation could be •O2– and photogenerated holes. Different electronic structures
for the triazine and tri-s-triazine phases of g-C3N4 result in the broadened band gap and increased
VBM for 3000CNC. The heterojunction between them facilitates the transfer
and separation of carriers. Moreover, the CB in the g-C3N4 matrix plays a key role in conducting the photoelectron
and reducing the recombination of electrons and holes. Therefore,
improved photocatalytic activity has been realized in 3000CNC.

3 Conclusions
We modified graphitic carbon nitride via
pyrolysis with a mixture
of urea and carbon black in different ratios, to obtain graphitic
carbon nitrides with built-in triazine and heptazine heterojunctions.
The crystallization and condensation degrees of graphitic carbon nitride
are improved, which is attributed to the carbon black working as the
condensation site for the generated intermediate gases. The doping
of carbon atoms in the graphitic carbon nitride matrix not only enhances
light absorption but also quenches the recombination of charge carriers.
Sample 200CNC exhibits a 70.2% removal ratio for MB, which is higher
than the 26.5% of CN. Sample 3000CNC shows the most superior photocatalytic
activity with the highest kinetic rate constant k in degradations of both MB and OrgII. It also exhibits a higher
hydrogen liberation rate than pristine g-C3N4. The carbon black-modified graphitic carbon nitride with unique
physicochemical structural features produced through a facile process
has a promising application in energy conversion and environmental
remediation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
Urea, the
cationic dye methylene blue (C16H18ClN3S), and the anionic dye Orange II sodium salt (C16H11N2NaO4S), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
were of analytical grade and used without further purification. TEOA
(AR, 98%) was purchased from Aladdin, China. Hydrochloroplatinic acid
H2PtCl6 (ACS, 99.95%, Pt 3 g L–1) and carbon black were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Milli-Q water
(ultrapure water) was utilized in all experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4 and
Carbon Black-Modified g-C3N4
The g-C3N4 used in this study was prepared by urea pyrolysis
at 550 °C for 3 h in an alumina crucible according to the literature.48 In brief, a given amount of urea was dried at
80 °C for 24 h, and then calcined at 550 °C for 3 h (the
heating rate was 2 °C min–1). After naturally
cooling down, buff-colored powders were collected and washed with
10% HNO3 solution and ultrapure water three times by centrifugation.
g-C3N4 samples were obtained and named as CN
for short in this work.

The carbon black-modified g-C3N4 samples were prepared by heating the mixture of urea
and CB at 550 °C for 3 h in an alumina crucible. In brief, the
mixtures of urea and CB at different ratios were dried at 80 °C
for 24 h independently, followed by calcination at 550 °C for
3 h (the heating rate was 2 °C min–1). After
cooling down naturally, dark gray powders were collected and washed
with 10% HNO3 solution and ultrapure water three times
by centrifugation. For abbreviation, the samples are denoted as nCNC, where n is the weight ratio of urea
to CB.

4.3 Characterization
XRD patterns were
analyzed on a Shimadzu diffractometer (XRD-6000, Tokyo, Japan) in
the reflection mode under Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418
nm) at a scanning rate of 0.02° s–1 with 2θ
ranging from 5 to 80°. FTIR spectra were recorded on a VERTEX
80/80 v FTIR spectrometer over a wavenumber range of 4000–400
cm–1. Surface chemical states for samples were investigated
by XPS, which were measured on a Kratos Axis ULTRA X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer with a 165 mm hemispherical electron energy analyser
and monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) at 225 W (15
kV, 15 mA) with a charge neutralizer and adventitious C 1s peak (284.6
eV) as the reference. The TEM images were taken using a JEOL JEM-1010
TEM. The HRTEM images and SAED patterns were obtained with an analytical
transmission electron microscope (The Philips Tecnai F20 FEG-S/TEM).
The SSA was calculated using the BET method, and the pore volumes
were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method
from the adsorption isotherms of N2 measured at 77 K on
a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020. The TG-DSC data were obtained on
a Shimadzu DTG-60A analyzer. In detail, 5–10 mg dry sample
was loaded in a Pt crucible without a lid and scanned at a rate of
2 or 10 °C min–1. DRS was measured using a
Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere
ISR-3100 using BaSO4 as the reference. Fluorescence spectra
were obtained using a photoluminescence spectrometer (FLS 920, Edinburgh
Instruments). EIS was measured in 6 M KOH aqueous solution with a
sinusoidal ac perturbation of 5 mV over a frequency range of 0.1–1
× 106 Hz.

4.4 Photocatalytic Performance
Evaluation
4.4.1 Adsorption and Photodegradation Experiment
The dyes’ adsorptions were measured on a batch mode. For
the adsorption of OrgII over the prepared samples (including CN and
3000CNC, 1500CNC, 1000CNC, 600CNC, and 200CNC), 10 mg solid sample
was added to 50 mL of an OrgII solution (the initial concentration
was 10 mg L–1) in the dark under stirring. At a
certain time interval, 5 mL of solution was extracted by a syringe
and filtered through a membrane (0.45 μm) and then the solution
was analyzed using a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
After the adsorption equilibrium, the photocatalytic degradation of
OrgII was carried out in an open thermostatic photoreactor under visible
light irradiation. The visible light source was obtained from a 200
W mercury lamp by adding a 400 nm cut filter.

For the adsorption
and photocatalytic degradation of MB under visible light, the initial
concentration of MB was the same as OrgII, and the test processes
were the same as mentioned above.

4.4.2 H2 Generation from Water Splitting
For H2 generation, 10 mg of the obtained samples, 10
mL triethanolamine (TEOA), and 100 μL H2PtCl6 solutions (Pt, 3 g L–1) were mixed and
diluted with ultrapure water to 100 mL. After sonication for 10 min,
the solution was transferred to the reaction cell and vacuumed under
stirring before being irradiated with visible light. A Xe lamp (CEAULIGHT,
CEL-HXF30) was the light source; a 420 nm cut filter (CEAULIGHT, CEL-UVIRCUT420)
was used (light intensity in the bottom center was adjusted to 100
mW cm–2). The generated hydrogen was monitored by
gas chromatography (TCD, CEAULIGHT, GC-7920) every 30 min with ultrapure
N2 worked as the carrier gas.
