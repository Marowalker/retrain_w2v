In order to obtain new fluorophores
potentially useful in imidazole
labeling and subsequent conjugation, a small series of Morita–Baylis–Hillman
acetates (3a–c) was designed, synthesized, and
reacted with imidazole. The optical properties of the corresponding
imidazole derivatives 4a–c were analyzed both
in solution and in the solid state. Although the solutions display
a very weak emission, the powders show a blue emission, particularly
enhanced in the case of compound 4c possessing two methoxy
groups in the cinnamic scaffold. The photophysical study confirmed
the hypothesis that the molecular rigidity of the solid state enhances
the emission properties of these compounds by triggering the restriction
of intramolecular motions, paving the way for their applications in
fluorogenic labeling.

Introduction
Imidazole is an aromatic
five-membered heterocyclic ring in which
the nitrogen atoms are not adjacent and is considered as a fascinating
tool in organic chemistry because of its features including high polarity,
water solubility, and amphoteric character.1,2 Imidazole
is contained in many synthetic compounds of pharmaceutical interest
including some antifungal, antiprotozoal, antihypertensive, and antileukemic.3,4 Moreover, its structure is also frequent in natural compounds such
as theophylline, purine, and histamine. Again, imidazole residues
are also included in several biological systems owing to their presence
in the side chain of the amino acid histidine.5 The imidazole ring of histidine is involved in many biological processes
such as in the active sites of ribonuclease and serine proteases and
in the complexation of metal ions in metalloproteinases such as hemoglobin,
myoglobin, and cytochrome C.6 Thanks to the important presence of imidazole in numerous vital
processes, the chemistry developed on imidazole can be used as an
important link between the organic chemistry and the biological chemistry.7

In biochemistry, proteins are labeled selectively
at precisely
defined positions in order to study their structure–function
behavior. Protein labeling strategies are generally based on the chemical
reactivity of particular amino acid side chains containing primary
amino or thiol groups. In recent years, a remarkable interest has
been devoted to the development of new probes potentially useful in
the site-specific tagging of proteins in complex biochemical environments.8−10

In particular, the insertion of a hexahistidine sequence at
one
extremity of a recombinant protein is currently used in the isolation
and purification of proteins expressed by bacteria from recombinant
DNA vectors. This strategy allows the recombinant protein to be purified
from native proteins by affinity chromatography and became the standard
technology for the preparation of recombinant proteins. The presence
of a hexahistidine tag has been exploited in coordination-chemistry-based
protein labeling procedures11,12 and provides also an
interesting prospect for selective irreversible protein derivatizations.11,13

On the other hand, biochemists exploit fluorescence spectroscopy
as an analytical technique in the study of protein interactions and
functions. The most commonly used detection techniques are based on
the use of fluorescent organic dyes, but recently, fluorogenic labeling
methods emerged as more promising approaches owing to their higher
signal-to-noise ratio, which is caused by the fluorescence activation
in the probe after its reaction/attachment to the desired site.10,14−16 Particularly interesting are fluorogens showing emission
intensities higher in the solid state than in solution, possessing
aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties.17,18 These fluorophores offer higher sensitivity, better accuracy, and
improved photostability with respect to traditional fluorescence probes
that are generally well-emissive in solution but undergo aggregation-caused
quenching processes at high concentration.19,20

Alkylation of histidine residues in polyhistidine tags of
engineered
proteins could be a difficult task because imidazole rings usually
show low reactivity in conventional alkylation reactions. Morita–Baylis–Hillman
adducts (MBHAs) have been proposed to represent interesting reagents
capable of alkylating imidazole by means of a concerted addition–elimination
process.21 Thus, owing to their high reactivity
to imidazole in the presence of water,22 MBHA derivatives could find applications as reagents for imidazole
modification. For example, a successful alkylation of N-acetylhexahistidine with MBHA derivatives was performed by means
of the aid of transition-metal cations interacting with a nitrilotriacetate
ligand linked to an MBHA leaving group.23

In the present paper, MBHA derivatives 3a–c (Figure 1) were designed
as imidazole-reactive molecules capable of producing imidazole-binding
cinnamic derivatives (IBCDs) 4a–c.

Figure 1 Design of imidazole-reactive
molecules 3a–c leading to IBCDs 4a–c showing fluorogenic properties.
The bold lines highlight the common cinnamic scaffold in the fluorophores.

Interestingly, we envisioned that
the important structural elements
(i.e., the push–pull structure in blue in Figure 1) of IBCD cinnamic scaffold
are contained into the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorophore
(1), leading to the assumption that compounds 4a–c could enhance their emissive features by the RIM (restriction of
intramolecular motions) phenomenon, thus showing fluorogenic properties.

Moreover, the introduction of the electron donor methoxy groups
in the cinnamic scaffold should increase the push–pull character
of the scaffold, altering the emission features of the compounds.24−27 Thus, a small series of Morita–Baylis–Hillman acetates
(3a–c) was synthesized and made to react with
imidazole to obtain the corresponding imidazole derivatives 4a–c, which were characterized from the point of view
of their optical properties.

Results and Discussion
MBHA derivatives 3a–c were synthesized by the
methodologies described in Scheme 1. In particular, MBHA derivative 3a was
prepared by a previously published procedure with the exception that
the final esterification of 7a was performed with acetyl
chloride.23 The MBHA derivative 3a was then made to react with 1.2 equiv of imidazole in tetrahydrofuran
(THF)–water (5:1) under reflux to obtain the imidazole derivative 4a.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of MBHA Derivatives 3a–c and Their
Reaction with Imidazole
Reagents: (i) propargyl
bromide,
K2CO3, and acetonitrile; (ii) methyl acrylate,
1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), CH3OH, and THF;
(iii) CH3COCl, triethylamine (TEA), and CH2Cl2; and (iv) imidazole, THF, and H2O.

MBHA derivatives 3b,c bearing additional
methoxy substituents
were prepared by the same procedure starting from the appropriate
aromatic aldehydes 5b,c, which were converted into the
corresponding propargyloxy derivatives 6b(28) and 6c.29 These compounds were then reacted with methyl acrylate in the presence
of DABCO to provide MBHA alcohols 7b,c, which were in
turn transformed into MBHA acetates 3b,c. Finally, compounds 3b,c were made to react with 1.2 equiv of imidazole in THF–water
(5:1) under reflux to obtain the imidazole derivatives 4b,c in 82–78% yields.

The UV–visible (UV–vis)
absorption and emission spectra
of imidazole derivatives 4a–c are shown in Figure 2 for the compounds
in diluted solution (i.e., 10–5 M in methanol) and
in the solid state (i.e., powders). Their main properties are compared
in Table 1 in which
the photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY)30 is also reported. The three compounds
show a very similar optical absorption, with a band peaked at about
300 nm in solution. The solutions are only weakly emissive, with PL
QYs below 1% and lifetimes below the experimental resolution (about
300 ps). In the solid state, all of them display blue emissions, rather
weak for compound 4a, increasing for compound 4b, and becoming quite bright for compound 4c. The weakly
emissive compound 4a shows a broad PL spectrum peaked
at 474 nm with about 0.5 ns lifetime. A deeper photophysical analysis
reveals that this broad emission is associated with the presence of
a longer lived component (average lifetime of about 260 μs)
with a red-shifted (500–600 nm) spectrum (see Figure S1 in
the Supporting Information). The methoxy 4b and dimethoxy 4c derivatives show narrow emission
spectra peaked at 411 nm (0.6 ns lifetime) and 436 nm (15 ns lifetime),
respectively, with the 4c derivative characterized by
a PL QY as high as 14% (see Table 1 and Figure 2).

In order to understand the nature of the weak emission
of the compounds
in solution and to assess the mechanism responsible for the increase
of their emission intensity in the solid state, we have performed
a deeper analysis of the emission properties of compound 4c because its powders display the strongest emission intensity. The
PL intensities of the compound dissolved in solvents with increasing
polarities (THF or methanol) do not reveal any clear dependence on
the solvent polarity, whereas an increase in the PL QY is observed
by using a viscous solvent (PEG 400, QY = 1.3%, see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This observation suggests
that the origin of the weak emission in solution is ascribed to the
intramolecular motions that are slowed down by increasing the solvent
viscosity.26,31 We have then performed a PL analysis
of 4c dissolved in methanol (good solvent) by adding
a nonsolvent (water) while keeping constant its concentration (about
3.5 × 10–5 M) in order to monitor the emission
of the compound upon microaggregation in solution. The results, reported
in Figure 3, show that
the PL spectra progressively red-shift from 415 to 450 nm by the addition
of water while the PL intensity (see the inset of Figure 3) displays a clear increase
at a water fraction of 60% and then decreases for higher water fractions.
These results demonstrate that (i) the emission intensity of the compound
is influenced by the environment rigidity rather than by its polarity
and that (ii) a particular type of aggregation (occurring at about
60% of water fraction in methanol) is necessary to enhance the emission.
Other organic compounds possessing a similar molecular structure have
shown fluorescence strongly dependent on the nature of the aggregated
particles and hence on the preparation methods.26,32−34 This behavior is typical of systems possessing crystallization-induced
emission (CIE) properties.35 In these systems,
the free intramolecular motions (vibrations and rotations) responsible
for the solution emission quenching are active also in the aggregated
state unless a strongly rigid solid-state packing is obtained.26,32,35 Only a very rigid environment,
such as that of a tight crystal packing or a very rigid matrix,32,33 is capable of inhibiting the molecular motions responsible for the
nonradiative deactivation of the excitations. For this reason, such
compounds often display polymorphism-dependent emissive properties
and have recently shown interesting mechanofluorescence and thermofluorescence
properties.36,37

Figure 3 Optical absorption and PL of the imidazole
derivative 4c in diluted methanol–water solutions
for different methanol–water
volume ratios. In the inset, the PL QY measured by exciting at 313
nm is plotted as a function of the water fraction.

In order to verify if this mechanism is at the
origin of the PL
properties of the compounds 4a–c, we have studied
their behavior in a good solvent when the diluted solution is frozen
so that the molecular motions are blocked in the solutions. In Figure 4, we report the PL
spectra of 4c in THF solution as measured at room temperature
and at 77 K (see Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information for the PL spectra of 4a and b, respectively), and the PL emission maxima positions are
reported in Table 1. For all compounds, a strong increase of the PL intensity (more
than 2 orders of magnitude) is observed, in agreement with the presence
of a quenching induced by the intramolecular motions in the solution
at room temperature.

Figure 4 PL of the imidazole derivative 4c in diluted
THF solution
(concentration of 5 × 10–4 M) at room temperature
(black line) and at 77 K (blue line) (excitation at 340 nm).

Interestingly, by comparing the
PL spectra of the glassy solutions
with those of the powders, we note that for compound 4a, a large spectral broadening and red shift are observed in the powder
emission. In particular, the presence of a long lived component in
the PL emission of 4a powders might be associated to
excimeric states formed by strong intermolecular interactions. From
the comparison of the photophysical properties of the three compounds,
we can therefore suggest that compound 4c displays the
highest tendency to aggregate in a rigid packing where weak intermolecular
interactions favors the emission, whereas a tight molecular packing
in compound 4a introduces weakly emissive excimeric states
accounting for the observed reduced emission efficiency.26 A combined structural and spectroscopic analysis
of the three compounds in the solid state will further shed light
on their complex photophysical behaviors.

Conclusions
With
the aim of obtaining new fluorophores potentially useful in
imidazole labeling and subsequent conjugation, a small series of Morita–Baylis–Hillman
acetates (3a–c) was designed, synthesized, and
made to react with imidazole to obtain the corresponding imidazole
derivatives 4a–c, which were characterized from
the point of view of their photophysical properties.

The analysis
of the photophysical features showed that the three
compounds display a very weak emission in solution. The starting imidazole
derivative 4a failed in showing a significant emission
in the solid state, which was instead observed in its methoxy and
dimethoxy derivatives 4b and 4c. These latter
compounds featured the AIE, and in particular, the bright blue emission
of compound 4c suggests the presence of CIE phenomenon,
with PL QYs in the powders increased by 2 orders of magnitude with
respect to the corresponding values measured in solution. The photophysical
study confirmed the hypothesis that the molecular rigidity of the
solid state enhances the emission properties of these compounds by
triggering the RIM as it occurs for GFP fluorophores inside the protein.27 Moreover, the results emphasized 3c as an imidazole-reactive molecule capable of forming a
new AIE fluorophore bearing a “clickable” propargyl
group potentially useful in the labeling of imidazole derivatives
and subsequent conjugation.

Optical Properties and
PL
UV–vis absorption
spectra were obtained with a PerkinElmer LAMBDA 900 spectrometer.
PL spectra were obtained with a SPEX 270M monochromator equipped with
a N2-cooled charge-coupled device exciting with a monochromated
450 W Xe lamp. The spectra were corrected for the instrument response.
PL QY values of the solutions were obtained by using quinine sulfate
as the reference, with an experimental error of about 5% for values
below 0.1%. PL QY values of the solid powders were measured with a
homemade integrating sphere, with an experimental error of 10% and
a sensitivity of about 0.1%, according to the procedure reported elsewhere.30 Time-resolved studies of the emission were performed
with a Nanolog spectrofluorometer with a DeltaTime TCSPC (time-correlated
single-photon counting) equipped with a single-photon detection module
PPD-850 by exciting with a DeltaDiode source at 300 nm or a pulsed
Xe lamp.
