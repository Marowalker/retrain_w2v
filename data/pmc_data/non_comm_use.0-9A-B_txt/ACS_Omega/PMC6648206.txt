With the rapid development of nanotechnology,
there is urgent need
of characterizing techniques; especially determining the particle
size distribution directly from solution. Dynamic light scattering
is often used but presence of a small number of aggregates can greatly
influence the size distribution. Electrospray scanning mobility particle
sizer (ES–SMPS) is rapidly emerging as an alternative method
in colloidal science. However, a major limitation is the use of silica-coated
capillaries, which are negatively charged at pH > 3, and therefore
making its use difficult for positively charged nanoparticles. In
this work, we have developed the polyether ether ketone (PEEK)
capillary for ES–SMPS, which removes this limitation because
it carries no charge. We have shown that the new capillary not only
produced equally good particle size distributions for negatively charged
particles (SiO2, Au, and latex) as obtained with silica
capillaries, but also precise particle size distributions for positively
charged particles (TiO2). Moreover, the PEEK capillaries are much
cheaper than the silica capillaries. Thus, the results shown in this
paper strengthen the development of the ES–SMPS method as a
versatile method for determining the particle size distributions of
colloidal sols directly from solution.

Introduction
For analysis where
sample integrity is paramount, the electrospray
(ES) offers a competent method to transfer analytes from liquid phase
to gaseous phase. It has become the method of choice for biological and heat-sensitive
samples and is often used in tandem with a mass spectrometer.1−3 A relatively recent area of application is within the colloid sciences
for measurement of size distributions of nanoparticles. This method
is described in detail in refs (4−10), and this paper only gives a short description of the different
instruments used in the method.

The ES uses a thin capillary
combined with an electrical field
to transfer the nanoparticles from a liquid sol to an aerosol.
The capillary tip is put under the influence of an electric field
which polarizes the liquid, leading to the formation of a Taylor cone.
The polarization also leads to mainly positively charged droplets
leaving the capillary tip; see Figure 1.3 These positive droplets
are drawn toward the negatively charged orifice. The droplets passing
through the orifice have their charge reduced by the use of an ionization
source. This prevents the droplets from reaching their Rayleigh limit
and leads to a more monodispersed droplet production.

Figure 1 Charge balance for the
droplet production at the electrospray tip.
The liquid at the tip is positively polarized, leading to production
of mainly positively charged droplets. These are attracted by the
negatively charged orifice. The resultant negative ions at the capillary
tip will diffuse through the ionic sample liquid to the platinum wire,
resulting in electrons moving toward the platinum wire.

The small droplets produced by the ES combined
with very dilute
dispersions of particles ensure that single particles are produced.
When used to measure the size distributions of nanoparticles, the
ES is connected to a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) coupled
to a condensation particle counter (CPC). The purpose of the ES is
to remove the solvent surrounding the nanoparticles, thus turning
the particles into an aerosol, which is guided into the SMPS (see Figure 2). The SMPS contains
a dynamic mobility analyzer (DMA), which separates the particles dependent
on their electric mobility diameter. Before entering the DMA, the
particles are charged using a radiation source, e.g. 85Kr. Then they enter the DMA, which contains an electrical field,
and by varying the strength of the electrical field the DMA can regulate
the size interval of particles that can exit the DMA and subsequently
enter the particle counter. In many aspects, the method used
by the DMA is similar to that used in time-of-flight instruments,
such as mass spectrometry. The SMPS thus separates particles according
to their size, and these particles are led into the CPC. In the CPC,
the particles enter a chamber containing air saturated with butanol.
After a temperature drop, the butanol becomes supersaturated and condenses
on the particles, which then grow to sizes that can be readily detected
by a laser. The laser detector counts the number of particles that
passes through the CPC.

setup.
Please note that this figure is neither proportional nor to scale;
in particular, the particles have been enlarged for clarity.

A reoccurring problem when running
nanoparticles in an ES is failure
of the capillary due to particle clogging, which completely hampers
the operation of the ES. To decrease the risk of clogging it is common
to use a capillary coated with silica. At pH levels above 2–4,
the silica capillary will carry a negative charge and this may decrease
the risk of clogging due to electrostatic repulsion in cases where
the nanoparticles also carry a negative charge. However, measurement
of particles carrying a positive surface charge is difficult,
if not impossible, because pH modification can lead to destabilization
of the particle suspension resulting in aggregation. Furthermore,
silica capillaries are expensive to buy and this, combined with a
rather short lifetime (usually 2–3 consecutive measurement
occasions), makes the method costly compared to, for example, dynamic
light scattering (DLS).

In this paper, we compare the size distribution
analysis of a range
of nanoparticles using the traditional silica capillary as well as
a novel PEEK capillary. The PEEK capillaries offer a pH neutral alternative
and are significantly cheaper (8–9 times) than the silica capillaries.
If PEEK capillaries can be shown to operate satisfactorily in the
ES, the use of PEEK capillaries will remove the need for pH adjustments
and will therefore save time as well as offer an advantage when, for
example, the particle type is unknown or the particle carries a positive
surface charge.

Results and Discussion
The resultant
flow through the capillaries at two different pH
levels can be seen in Table 1. No difference in the flow rate is observed for the PEEK
capillary, pointing toward the inertness of the PEEK material interactions
with the liquid. Only a minor difference in flow is observed for the
silica capillary, which is probably due to a slight change in the
liquid–silica interactions at the capillary surface as the
pH changes. Note the clear difference in flow between the silica
and PEEK capillaries. The lower flow observed in the silica capillary
is probably due to stronger interactions between the liquid and the silica
capillary surface. The PEEK material will remain nonpolar independent
of pH and will not interact significantly with the polar liquid, resulting
in a higher flow through the PEEK capillaries.

Figure 3 shows the
resultant droplet size distributions calculated with eq 1 (see the experimental section)
from the sucrose particle distributions. Both distributions show a
large peak at 150–160 nm, and the largest droplets produced
are around 200 nm, with the PEEK distribution being slightly shifted.
This suggests that the PEEK capillary produced droplets that are slightly
larger, around 10 nm, than those produced by the silica capillary.
The result of this is not only the small shift in particle distribution
but also the decrease in the production of smaller droplets, resulting
in a lower peak for the PEEK capillary. The reason for the slightly
larger droplets produced by the PEEK capillary might be that the liquid
flow rate through the capillary is higher; see Table 1. This is discussed in more detail with regard
to the peak height for the results presented in Figure 4.

(dark blue triangles)
and the PEEK capillary (yellow circles). These droplet distributions
have been calculated from the sucrose particle distribution using eq 1 for respective capillary
types. The particle size at the peak maximum of each distribution
is shown in the boxes.

(c) titanium oxide particles, and (d) latex particles. Distributions
produced with silica capillary are shown in dark blue triangles, and
distributions produced with PEEK capillary are shown in brown circles.
The particle size at the peak maximum of each distribution is shown
in the boxes.

It was difficult to observe
the formation of a Taylor cone when
using the PEEK capillary; see Figure 5. This might affect the results since the Taylor cone
is a clear sign that the capillary is producing droplets. However,
with the TSI model 3480 electrospray, another clear sign that droplets
are produced is the presence of a steady current (as mentioned in
the experimental section this is usually around 200–300 nA).
For the PEEK capillary, the presence of such a current was used as
a sign that the spray was operating and as discussed below in relation
to the results presented in Figure 3, the presence of a Taylor cone seems to have a negligible
effect on droplet size.

capillary below.

tip of the PEEK capillary mounted in the ES. Please note the difficulty
of observing any Taylor cone. Bottom right: the tip of the silica
capillary mounted in the ES. Note the clear presence of a Taylor cone

It should be noted that the unit dN/d log Dp given in the y-axis of the
graphs takes into account the width of the particle size interval
with regard to the particle frequency, where N is
the number of particles and Dp is the
particle diameter. Essentially, the unit represents frequency/diameter
interval and is frequently used when describing particle distributions
within aerosol science. It is of importance since as the DMA scans
through the particle diameters, the size intervals increase. That
is, the size intervals of particles being separated by the SMPS increase
the larger the particle size.

Knowing the average droplet size
of 155 nm (estimated from Figure 3) and the particle
concentration of 0.0025 wt %, it is possible to calculate the average
number of particles per droplet for silica nanoparticles (physical
properties for silica nanoparticles and sols are well established).
Using the density of amorphous silica (2.2 g/mL), the average number
of particles per droplet leaving the capillary tip is 0.0035 particles.
This is increased to 0.035 particles/droplet if the particle concentration
is increased to 0.025 wt %, which, as mentioned in the experimental
section, does not result in any significant shift in size distribution.
The risk of aggregation due to two or more particles ending up in
the same droplet can therefore be considered to be minimal in particle
concentrations < 0.025 wt %. This is further supported by data
given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The number of droplets produced, given a flow rate of 66 nL/min
(taken from electrospray manual11), is
approximately 3.38 × 109 droplets/min. For the measured
flow rates, the droplet production is 1.07 × 1010 for
the PEEK capillary and around 5.74 × 109 for the silica
capillary (calculated from flow rates of Table 1). Since both the silica and PEEK capillary
show a similar droplet distribution (difference ≤ 10 nm), we
argue that the particle/droplet calculations are valid for both capillary
types.

Figure 4 shows the
particle distributions produced using the silica and PEEK capillary
for different particle types. For silica nanoparticles (Figure 4a), the PEEK capillary produces
a slight shift toward larger size distribution compared to the silica
capillary. This is consistent with the observations made for the sucrose
distributions and is probably due to the slightly larger droplets
produced by the PEEK capillary. The chance of two particles ending
up in the same droplet is thus slightly larger for the PEEK capillary,
explaining the slight shift in particle distribution. The same shift
is observed for the titanium dioxide particles (Figure 4c) which shows similar particle
intensities as those of the silica nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticles
(Figure 4b), however,
show no shift for the PEEK capillary, which is mainly due to the low
particle intensities observed; the chance of two gold nanoparticles
ending up in the same droplet is lower due to the low particle concentration.
The effect of the slightly larger droplet size for the PEEK capillary
can thereby be said to be nullified by lowering the particle concentration.
The latex particles had a weight concentration similar to that of
the silica particles and the lower particles intensities observed
are due to the use of the model 3081 DMA. The broad scan interval
of the 3081 DMA results in the interval for each size being significantly
broader than for the 3085 DMA (used for the silica, gold, and titanium
oxide particles), leading to lower particle intensities. This is in
accordance to the previously mentioned unit dN/d log Dp, where the number of particles is divided
by the size interval. Furthermore, the larger latex particles lead
to lower particle concentrations compared to those of silica since
the particle wt% is similar for silica and latex. The shifts observed
for the latex particles (Figure 4d) is thus in accordance with those observed for silica
and titanium dioxide particles. It has to be noted that the slight
shifts in particle distributions observed here are minor (≤
10%), and we would argue that for most users of the ES–SMPS
method it is negligible. Furthermore, if an absolute exactness is
needed, one can run the PEEK capillary at lower particle concentrations,
which will remove the shift in distribution as proven by the gold
particle distribution. The PEEK capillary can therefore be said to
produce particle distributions that offer satisfactory accuracy compared
to the standard silica capillary.

As can be observed in Figure 4b–d, the PEEK
capillary produces higher particle
intensities than those of the silica capillaries. One possible explanation
for this behavior might be the nonpolar nature of the PEEK material.
Silica is hydrophilic, which will lead to interactions between the
buffer and the silica capillary wall, leading to a flow gradient affecting
the flow rate; see Table 1. PEEK is largely hydrophobic, which will limit the interactions
between the buffer and the PEEK capillary wall, limiting the interactions
with water. The result of the different hydrophobicities will most
probably be a larger flow rate through the PEEK capillary, generating
more droplets and thus more particles per time unit. Furthermore,
the difference between the respective charge of the PEEK and silica
walls may also affect the interactions between particles and capillary
wall. For silica particles, the respective sign of the charge
on the particle surface and the capillary surface will
be similar. For other particles such as gold or titanium oxide, the
charge difference between the particles and the silica particles is
greater. In short, this charge difference might affect the total flow
through the capillary by increasing the interactions between particles
and capillary wall. The PEEK capillary carries no charge and will
thus be unaffected in this sense by the particle type.

The ES–SMPS-CPC
method conducts measurement of monodisperse
particles exiting the DMA and therefore is not biased toward larger
particles. However, the distance travelled by the particles may cause
losses, which may affect the count rate. Also, we have previously
discussed the risk with two or more particles ending up in the same
droplet produced by the electrospray, which may shift the distribution
toward larger sizes. This will occur if large concentrations of particles
are sprayed but, as we have shown, this is not a problem if proper
care is taken to dilute the particles in buffer.

Conclusions
We
have shown that a custom-modified PEEK capillary offers a cheap
alternative to the silica capillary otherwise used for particle size
distribution measurements. Reference measurements with a sucrose solution
show that both capillary types produce droplet size distributions
around 150–160 nm, with the largest droplets being around 200
nm. The probability that two particles are sprayed in the same droplet
is low at the concentrations tested. Although the PEEK capillary showed
a slight shift of the distributions at 0.0025 wt % particle concentrations,
the shift was minor and disappeared completely at lower particle concentrations.

Experimental
Section
PEEK capillaries are commercially available due to
their excellent
chemical and heat resistance, leading to extensive use in chromatographic
instruments, such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography.
A 1.5 m PEEK tube with an inner diameter (ID) of 25 μm and an
outer diameter (OD) 1/16″ was purchased from Kinesis. Using
a capillary cutter, the PEEK tube was divided into 25 cm pieces. The
PEEK capillaries were tapered in one end using sandpaper on a rotating
disk. The tapering was done to minimize the interaction
between the liquid and the capillary end.

Silica capillaries
were purchased from TSI Incorporated and were
delivered in 25 cm pieces already tapered in one end. The silica capillaries
have an ID of 25 μm and an OD of 150 μm. To fit into the
ES, a PEEK tube with OD 1/16″ and ID of 175 μm was used
as a holder for the silica capillaries. This prevented excessive leakage
of carrier gas from the ES. Figure 5 shows the two capillaries next to each other as well
as the view of the capillaries when placed in the ES.

To compare
the results of using the silica capillary with the use
of the PEEK capillary, several different nanoparticle types were analyzed.
Particle concentration varied depending on the particle type and the
concentration of the original sol but was usually diluted to approximately
0.0025 wt %. The risk of aggregation in the electrospray increases
with particle concentration because the probability that two
or more particles will be present in the same sprayed droplet increases.
By running a range of silica nanoparticle concentrations and observing
if/when a shift occurs in the size distribution, the risk of several
particles being sprayed in the same droplet could be evaluated. For
concentrations of 0.0025–0.025 wt %, no such shift was observed;
with only a slight shift observed at 0.25 wt %; see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

To compare
the performance of PEEK and silica capillaries, the
nanoparticles tested were silica nanoparticles of Levasil Cembinder
17 (Akzo Nobel), gold nanoparticles (Merck), latex nanoparticles from
acrylic copolymer (Alberdink Boley, AC 2007), and titanium dioxide
nanoparticles (made in house). The silica nanoparticles were delivered
in 40 wt % sol and had to be significantly diluted to be analyzed
by the ES–SMPS-CPC method. This was done using 20 mM ammonium
acetate buffer. The pH of the buffer was adjusted using either 1 M
ammonia solution or 30 vol% acetic acid solution. The buffer was used
to raise the conductivity of the solution to facilitate spraying of
the solution by the formation of a Taylor cone at the capillary tip.
The presence of the buffer can lead to small amounts of ammonium acetate
precipitating on the particles, leading to a minor shift in size distribution.
This shift is deemed to be negligible and has been shown to be in
the order of 0.114 nm for 60 nm spheres and 0.206 nm for 100 nm spheres.12 For silica nanoparticles, the pH of the buffer
was around 8.2. At this pH, the silica nanoparticles and the silica
capillary will be negatively charged, reducing the risk of clogging.

The gold nanoparticles were purchased from Merck as a sol in citrate
buffer. The particles have, according to the manufacturer, an average
diameter of 20 nm and the sol contains approximately 0.0053 wt % particles.
The low particle concentration meant that the gold particles only
had to be diluted by 50% with ammonium acetate buffer of pH 8.2.

The titanium oxide particles were synthesized using a method described
in detail by Abbas et al.13 Since the size
of the primary particles during the synthesis is too small to detect
in the ES–SMPS system (hydrodynamic diameter, dH ≈ 4 nm), mild aggregation was initiated using
dialysis, which increased the pH from 2 to 5. As the pH approached
the pHPZC, the particles started to aggregate and formed
a weak gel. Once the pH was adjusted to 2.5 and the dispersion had
been stored at 5 °C for at least a month, particles with hydrodynamic
diameters of 30 nm were obtained. The final concentration of particles
in the synthesized sol was 18 g/L. A 10% particle solution 90% buffer
resulted in satisfactory particle intensities. The pH of the buffer
was adjusted to 2 due to the relatively high point of zero charge
of the titanium oxide nanoparticles (pHpzc ≈ 6)14 in combination with the fact that the particle
sol was kept stabilized around pH 3. This pH would lead to the
silica capillary carrying a neutral to slightly positive charge while
the titanium oxide particles are positively charged and this would
prevent clogging in the capillary.

The latex particles had a
particle concentration of 46–48
wt % and were diluted in a pH 8.2 buffer to a concentration of 0.0029–0.0030
wt %.

The pH was adjusted for the PEEK capillary so that it
matched the
pH of the dispersions that were run with the silica capillary, even
though the PEEK capillary will remain neutral at all pH levels. This
was done to facilitate comparison of the results produced by the two
capillaries, but for any other purposes it is considered an unnecessary
step for the PEEK capillary.

The flow through the respective
capillary types was measured by
weighing the Eppendorf sample containers before and after 2 h of sampling
(spraying) in the electrospray of buffer solution. Two pH levels of
2 and 8 were measured. The resultant weight difference was taken to
correspond to the volume of the sprayed sample. For this, the density
of water used was taken as 1 g = 1 mL.

It is possible to measure
the size distribution of the droplets
produced at the capillary tip by running a sucrose solution.7 A bulk sucrose 10% v/v solution was prepared
by dissolving 15.8 g of sucrose powder (Sigma-Aldrich, >99.5%)
in
100 mL of buffer solution at pH 8.2. Before analysis, the bulk solution
was further diluted to a concentration of 0.1% v/v. By using the empirical eq 1, where Dd is droplet size, C is sucrose concentration
% v/v as a decimal, and Dp is the sucrose
particle diameter, the size of the droplet produced at the capillary
tip could be calculated from the sucrose particle distribution.7,11 1  The ES unit used was a TSI model 3480 Electrospray
Aerosol Generator, which was run at an air flow of 1.0 L/min and a
CO2 flow of 0.1 L/min. The ES was equipped with a 210Po ionization source to reduce the charge of produced droplets.
The voltage applied around the capillary tip was between −2.1
and −2.4 kV, which at standard operation (spraying of droplets
from the capillary tip), generated a current of 200–300 nA.
The pressure drop across the capillary was set to 3.7–3.8 psig
(25.5–26.2 kPa gauge). At these settings, the flow through
a 25 cm capillary with an ID of 25 μm is 66 nL/min according
to the ES manual but measured values can be found in Table 1.11 The SMPS unit used was a TSI Series 3080 Electrostatic Classifier
equipped with a nano DMA model 3085. This allowed measurements of
particles from 10 to 120 nm, although the interval at a shear flow
of 8 L/min was approximately 10–90 nm. The latex particles
had a particle distribution of >120 nm, which required a change
of
DMA to model 3081 that allowed measurement of particles between 10
and 1000 nm. This was run at shear rate of 5 L/min, which generated
a scan interval of 10–480 nm. The CPC unit used was a TSI model
3010, which operated with a temperature difference of 17 K and an
air flow of 1 L/min.
