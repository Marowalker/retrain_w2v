Optimal conditions
for ultrasonic-assisted extraction of polysaccharide from Chinese
okra were found using response surface methodology. The okra polysaccharide
(OPS) was used for the adsorption of methyl violet 6B (MV). Conditions
for maximal adsorption efficiency of MV were established. The mechanism
of MV adsorption was investigated by the characterization and physicochemical
analysis of OPS before and after the adsorption of MV. Both infrared
(IR) analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation suggest that
MV adsorption by OPS was an electrostatic interaction between MV and
oxygen-containing groups of OPS. Further, the results of first-principles
calculation were in agreement with IR spectroscopy measurements and
MD simulation, which were all consistent with the suggested adsorption
mechanism. Optimization of okra extraction conditions, maximized efficiency
of MV adsorption by OPS, and the understanding of the adsorption mechanism
are the highlights of this work, providing a reference for promising
applications of OPS in the treatment of wastewater in textile, paper,
and other industries.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Pollution of dyes has been
a great concern for industries employing large quantity of dyes for
their products, such as paper, textile, and plastics. Dye-contaminated
water can be highly visible even at a low dye concentration,1,2 causing public concern of health risks.3 Therefore, much attention has been paid to dye removal.4 Several methods using chemical agents for dye
decolorization have been reported,2 but
they have not been widely applied in textile and paper industries
due to high cost and difficulty of disposal after treatment.5 Recently, decolorization methods of dye waste
water using materials from modified or unmodified biomass sources
have been reported.6,7 Biosorbents based on chitin, lignin,
chitosan, peat, yeast, fungi, or other biomasses are employed as chelating
and complexing agents to remove dyes from effluents.4,8

We use okra polysaccharides (OPS) to treat water containing
the dye methyl violet 6B (MV, Table 1). As a biosorbent, OPS has its intrinsic advantages
of abundance and easiness of processing. Polysaccharide molecules
contain many polar groups (such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups),
providing potential sites for the adsorption of dyes. Compared to
traditional methods, this kind of biosorption is more selective, effective,
and economic.

Table 1 Chemical Formulas
and Some Properties of
MV 6B
Recently, progress has been made in the investigation
of adsorption behavior and mechanism by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.9,10 For the polysaccharide–dye system in our study, we use a
novel combination of MD simulation, first-principles calculation,
and infrared (IR) analyses to establish the mechanism of OPS–MV
interaction.

Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench) is a perennial plant in the family of Malvaceae, which
has a long history of cultivation and is currently grown in different
temperate zones. Its edible seed-pods contain high content of polysaccharides
and trace elements. Its seeds, flowers, and other parts are rich in
flavonoids, amino acids, and vitamins, providing high nutritional
values. Among these components, polysaccharide is of great significance,
showing immunomodulatory,11,12 antineoplastic,13,14 and antihyperlipidemic effects.15

Polysaccharides can be extracted from plants using hot water. The
disadvantages include substantial consumption of water, energy, and
time.16 Alternative methods such as ultrasonic-,
microwave-, and infrared-assisted extractions have been reported.17−19 We use ultrasonic-assisted extraction
of polysaccharide from okra because of its remarkable advantages including
moderate solvent consumption, short extraction time, and high extraction
yield.20 To investigate the overall impacts
of independent variables on extraction efficiency, classical method
of studying one variable at a time can be ineffective. Therefore,
we use an optimization strategy that examines the combined effects
of all independent variables on the extraction efficiency, along with
interactions between these variables. Response surface methodology
(RSM)21−23 is a collection
of statistical and mathematical tools we choose to find conditions
for optimal extraction efficiency. Collectively, we utilized the ultrasonic-assisted
extraction technology, along with RSM, to optimize polysaccharide
extraction from okra. To carry out RSM, the Box–Behnken design
with three independent variables (extraction time, liquid–solid
ratio, and extraction temperature) was employed to find the best set
of variables for optimal extraction yield. Further physicochemical
analysis of OPS was performed to study the decolorization efficiency
of OPS under various conditions. The varying factors include temperature,
contact time, polysaccharide concentration, and initial dye concentration
in the solution (pH value was kept at 11 for all trials). The mechanism
of adsorption in the decolorization process was discussed extensively
using the information obtained in IR analyses, MD simulation, and
first-principle calculations.

2 Materials
All materials/apparatus used for extraction
and characterization of polysaccharide are presented in the Supporting Information. Devices and instruments
used include a thermostatic heating magnetic stirrer (DF-101Z), a
low-temperature stirring reaction bath (DHJF-2005), a TG16-WS bench
centrifuge, and a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-1200).

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Extraction and Physicochemical
Analysis of Polysaccharide
The polysaccharide was extracted
from freeze-dried okra by ultrasonic-assisted technology under optimal
conditions established in this work (extraction time of 31 min, liquid–solid
ratio of 51:1, and temperature of 63 °C), creating a yield of
22.35% (w/w, unless indicated otherwise). Based on physicochemical
analysis, the molar ratio of rhamnose, galactose, and glucose in the
OPS was 1:0.56:0.13. The content of uronic acid in OPS was 10.71%,
and the average molecular weight of OPS was 68 010 Da. Details
of optimization and physiochemical analysis are presented in the Supporting Information.

3.2 Adsorption Experiments
OPS belongs
to anionic natural macromolecules, as indicated by its negative values
of ζ-potential (see the Supporting Information). Studies have shown that the presence of cations (such as Al3+, Fe3+) improves the flocculation of anionic polymers.24 These cations can provide a bridging between
negative charges on the surface of the anionic polymer and promote
flocculation. In our work, Fe3+ ions facilitate the bridging
effect between the negative hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups in OPS,
promoting the flocculation and precipitation (hence decolorization)
of OPS–MV complexes.

Adsorption experiments was carried
out by adding OPS to MV solution treated with Fe2(SO4)3 and adjusted to targeted pH value; each component
in the mixture was added based on planned amount or concentration.
Four independent variables, contact time (stirring time + rest time),
initial concentration of MV, concentration of OPS, and temperature,
were individually investigated, with other factors remaining unchanged.

A certain amount of sodium hydroxide solution was added to a 10
mL of MV solution of certain concentration, so that its pH was adjusted
to 11. Then, a certain amount of Fe2(SO4)3 was added to the solution so that the final concentration
of ferric sulfate was maintained at 50 mg/L. Certain amount of dried,
powdery OPS was added to the above solution. The mixture was stirred
for 20 min and then rested for a recorded time at a controlled temperature.
Finally, the solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 600 rpm, the supernatant
was retrieved for absorbance measurements at λmax of 580 nm.

The concentration of residual MV was determined
based on a MV calibration curve. The dye removal efficiency (%) and
the relative amount of MV adsorbed at equilibrium (qe, mg/g) was calculated as follows 1   2  where V is volume of the solution; m is the mass
of dried OPS; and C0 and Cf are initial and final (equilibrium) concentrations of
MV, respectively. The standard curve of MV is presented in Figure 1. Its linear regression
equation, y = 0.00722 + 0.01869x (R2 = 0.99883), was the basis of further
calculation.

Figure 1 Standard curve of MV.

3.3 Molecular
Dynamic Simulations
In the simulation, the geometric optimization
procedure with energy convergence tolerance of 10–5 kcal/mol was performed to obtain low potential energy characteristics
for each cell by using smart minimized method. After this step, the
amorphous cell was annealed at the pressure of one bar; five annealing
cycles from the initial temperature of 300 K to the mid-cycle temperature
of 600 K were repeated. Finally, the cell was subjected to 1 ns of
NVT (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) ensemble
and 1 ns of NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature)
ensemble. In each simulation, periodic boundary condition was applied.
The pressure and temperature were controlled by Andersen barostat25 and Berendsen thermostat,26 respectively. The Verlet velocity time integration method27 with a time step of 1 fs was used to integrate
the Newtonian equation of motion. The van der Waals interactions were
calculated by the Lennard–Jones function with a cutoff radius
of 1.25 nm, and the electrostatic interactions were approximated by
the Ewald method.28 All the simulations
were performed with Material Studio software applying a universal
force field.

3.4 Density
Functional Theory Based Modeling
Modeling was performed using
density functional theory (DFT), implemented by means of the pseudopotential
code SIESTA,29 as was done in our previous
work on adsorption of molecules to metal–organic frameworks.30 All calculations were performed using generalized
gradient approximation
(Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof),31 including spin polarization with consideration of van der Waals
correction.32 Full optimization of the
atomic positions was also carried out. During this optimization, the
ion cores were described by norm-conserving nonrelativistic pseudopotentials33 with cutoff radii of 1.14, 1.48, 1.47, and 1.25
au for C, N, O, and H, respectively. The wave functions were expanded
with a double-ζ plus polarization basis of localized orbitals
for nonhydrogen atoms and with a double-ζ basis for hydrogen
atoms. Optimizations of the force and total energy were performed
with the accuracies of 0.04 eV/Å and 0.001 eV, respectively.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Factors Affecting the Removal
Efficiency of Dye
4.1.1 Contact Time
As shown in Figure 2a, at the initial stage of adsorption, MV
molecules were easily adsorbed to the active sites of the polysaccharides,
thus the adsorption rate was relatively fast. With the extension of
time, adsorption rate decreased gradually as less number of active
sites became available, until the adsorption equilibrium was reached.
At the contact time of 8 h, the adsorption capacity of OPS was reached,
and the maximal dye removal efficiency was achieved. In all the following
sections, measurements were performed after maximal contact time (more
than 24 h).

Figure 2 Impacts of four factors
on dye removal efficiency (removal
percent) (a, b, d, e). (a) Contact time: concentrations of OPS and
initial MV are both 50 mg/L, room temperature (RT). (b) OPS concentration:
initial MV concentration is 50 mg/L, contact time >24 h, under
RT. (d) Concentration of initial MV: concentration of OPS is 50 mg/L,
contact time >24 h, under RT. (e) Temperature: concentrations of
OPS and initial MV are both 50 mg/L, contact time >24 h. Other
facts (c, f). (c) Effect of OPS concentration on ζ-potential
value. (f) Decoloration results: a pure MV solution (right) compared
to a sample after decolorization (left).

4.1.2 OPS Concentration
The effects of OPS concentration on the
adsorption rate and ζ-potential of MV solution are shown in Figure 2b,c. In general,
as the concentration of polysaccharides increases, the absolute value
of ζ-potential increases (becomes more negative) significantly
due to more negative charges of the OPS (an anionic polymer). However,
this monotonous trend (Figure 2c) does not echo in the trend of dye removal efficiency (Figure 2b) as OPS concentration
increases.

When OPS concentration increased to a certain level,
ζ-potential became more negative, to about −8 mV; during
this period, dye removal efficiency increased. It was reported that
in this range of ζ values, coagulation–flocculation is
thermodynamically favored.34,35 When the concentration
of OPS in the MV solution increased further, that is, to a level >50
mg/L, the absolute value of the ζ-potential became too large,
which was in favor of the formation of a stable colloidal solution.
In other words, coagulation–flocculation became more difficult,
hence dye removal efficiency decreased.

4.1.3 Initial Dye Concentration
A given
amount of adsorbent can only adsorb a fixed amount of adsorbate, hence
the initial concentration of adsorbate is important.36 Initial dye concentration affects the rate of adsorption
and relative number of sites on OPS available for adsorbing MV molecules.37

According to Figure 2d, at first, the decolorization rate increased
steeply with the increase of MV concentration. Before the MV concentration
becomes too large, there is a relatively large number of unoccupied
adsorption sites on the OPS molecules, allowing easy adsorption of
MV. As the MV concentration increases to an upper limit, much less
adsorption sites are available, leading to an adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. As the MV concentration further increases beyond the
upper limit, there is no further adsorption, leading to a decrease
of removal efficiency due to the increase of the denominator, as shown
in eq 1.

4.1.4 Temperature
Temperature
is another significant parameter because it affects the adsorption–desorption
equilibrium between the adsorbent and the adsorbate.38 From 10 to 20 °C, kinetic factor dominates: as the
temperature increases, there is a slight increase of decolorization
efficiency, as shown in Figure 2e. Beyond 20 °C, thermodynamic factor dominates: adsorption
is an exothermic process (see Section 4.2); therefore, increase in temperature leads
to decrease of the adsorption capacity.

Decolorization of the
MV solution is shown in Figure 2f. The color of the dye solution turned from purple to near
limpidity, indicating a near complete removal of MV. The precipitation
at the bottom of the left-side sample vial was the result of coagulation–flocculation
after MV molecules were adsorbed by OPS.

It is worth mentioning
that in studying the efficiency of MV adsorption by OPS, we kept the
pH value constant at 11 for all trials. This is because the change
of pH value has a dramatic impact on the protonation–deprotonation
equilibrium of the MV molecules and hence the nature of the dye. Reducing
the pH will lead to the protonation of MV and alter its color toward
yellow. Increasing the pH prevents the protonation and helps maintain
MV in the form shown in Table 1, to the extent of pH 11. Beyond pH 11, MV will become deprotonated,
leading to a shift of its absorption peak. Under this condition, evaluation
of MV decolorization by OPS using absorbance at 580 nm becomes impossible.

4.2 Thermodynamic
Analysis of Adsorption
Adsorption isotherm models39 are fundamental in describing the interactions
between adsorbents and adsorbates. We use these models to investigate
the mechanism of adsorption in our study. The equilibrium experimental
data were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models
as follows:

(a) Langmuir isotherm model 3  where
ρe is the concentration of MV at an equilibrium (mg/L), qe is the amount of MV adsorbed by OPS at an
equilibrium (mg/g), qm is the theoretical
maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g) corresponding to monolayer coverage,
and KL is the Langmuir isotherm constant
(L/mg).

To decide whether the adsorption process is favorable
or not, a dimensionless constant, separation factor RL, is defined by 4  where ρ0 is the initial MV concentration (mg/L).

The Langmuir model is based on the assumption of monolayer adsorption
on a structurally homogeneous adsorbent, where all the adsorption
sites are identical and energetically equivalent.40

(b) Freundlich isotherm model 5  where KF and 1/n are
constants of the Freundlich isotherm model.

The Langmuir and
Freundlich isotherm plots are shown in Figure 3, and relevant parameters are shown in Table 2.

Figure 3 (a) Langmuir isotherm
model and (b) Freundlich isotherm
model.

Table 2 Isotherm Parameters

KL (L/mg)	1.2318	1.0805	0.9968	
RL	0.0160	0.1817	0.0197

1/n	0.1570	0.1550	0.1569	
R2	0.9952	0.9948	0.9947	
As shown in Table 2, the correlation
coefficients, R2, of the Langmuir isotherms
were all higher than 0.99 at three different temperatures, indicating
that adsorption processes were best described by the Langmuir isotherm
model. Further, RL represents the adsorption
capability of adsorbent at certain temperature. If RL > 1, adsorption is unfavorable; if RL = 1, adsorption process is linear, that is, desorption
occurs simultaneously with adsorption; if 0 ≤ RL < 1, adsorption is favorable. The calculated values
of RL were all in the range of 0–1,
thereby confirming that adsorption processes are favorable under all
these temperatures.

The empirical Freundlich equation is applicable
to describe the adsorption and interactions on heterogeneous surfaces.
This equation is not restricted to the formation of a monolayer.41 It can be seen from Table 2 that the R2 of
Freundlich isotherm models were all higher than 0.99, which indicates
that the experimental data agree well with the Freundlich model. Freundlich
constant KF represents the adsorption
capacity of the adsorbent, and a higher value indicates that the adsorbent
has a higher affinity to the adsorbate. 1/n is the
empirical parameter related to the strength of adsorption, which varies
with the heterogeneity of the material.39 If 0.1 < 1/n < 1, the adsorption is favorable.
As shown in Table 2, all the values of 1/n support the favorability
of the adsorption.

Thermodynamic parameters can be decided using
the adsorption constant KL (L/mol) obtained
from the Langmuir isotherm. The values of ΔG0, ΔH0, and ΔS0 for the adsorption process were calculated
using the following equations 6   7  where R is the universal gas constant and T is the temperature
in Kelvin. The values of ΔH0 and
ΔS0 can be obtained from the slope
and intercept of the plot of ΔG0 against T. The results of ΔG0, ΔH0, and ΔS0 are shown in Table 3. A positive ΔS0 can be related to an increased number of vibrational frequencies
in the OPS + MV system (see Sections 4.3 and 4.5). The
negative values of ΔG0 suggested
that the adsorption of MV was thermodynamically favored. Energy required
for the decoupling of MV from OPS is −ΔG0. On the other hand, an increased temperature will lead
to an increased decoupling rate, according to the Arrhenius equation, k = Ae–Ea/RT.

Based on the intercept and slope of ΔG0–T plot, ΔH0 = −19.39 kJ/mol, and ΔS0= 42.65 J/(mol/K).

4.3 Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR)
Spectroscopy of Materials and Product
FT-IR spectra of OPS,
MV, and precipitates are shown in Figure 4. Detailed peak frequencies are reported
in Table 4. The broad
peak of OPS at about 3400 cm–1 was assigned to O–H
stretching vibrations of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen
bondings of saccharides. This peak disappeared in the IR spectrum
of the product and was replaced by two sharper peaks at 3444 and 3344
cm–1. This phenomenon indicated that the MV molecule
and the OPS were bound together by the bridging of the hydroxyl group.
The split of the peak was caused by the formation of two types of
hydroxyl groups on sugar rings of OPS: bonded and nonbonded (with
MV). Due to the C=O stretching vibration of carboxylic groups,
the OPS produced a strong peak at 1740 cm–1. However,
in the IR spectrum of the product, this peak was weakened, indicating
that the carboxylic groups were also involved in the adsorption, which
may be combined with certain cationic MV molecules. The peaks related
with C–N–R stretching at 1364 cm–1 in MV and C–H asymmetric vibrations in methyl groups of OPS
at 2938 cm–1 are smeared. The strong peaks at 1462,
1629, and 1677 cm–1 were all due to the skeletal
vibrations of the benzene rings, which were derived from the triphenylmethane
structure in MV. The absorption peak of 1171 cm–1 related to the C–N stretching vibration in pure MV is shifted
to 1158 cm–1 in the products. The absorption peak
at 1033 cm–1 was caused by C–O–C stretching
vibration of glycosidic linkage on the sugar ring. The IR spectrum
of the products retained certain characteristic peaks of both MV and
OPS, indicating that the two were combined by physical adsorption
and no chemical reaction occurred. Further theoretical modeling (see Section 4.5) confirmed
this interpretation of the IR spectra.

b Note: (1)
Due to the simplification of OPS structure, only limited number of
vibrational frequencies can be calculated with DFT modeling. (2) The
existence of chloride ions in the MV solution would cause slight shifting
of some peaks,42 but it would not disturb
the analysis. (3) Types I and II refer to two types of sugar rings
shown in Figures 5 and 8, respectively. The letters (a and b) refer to two
types of hydroxyls participating in the adsorption of MV.

For the theoretical evaluation
of the effect of noncovalent bonds formed between MV and OPS, we calculate
the change of the total energy of the system as a result of the stretching
of 0.04 Å by selected bonds. The value of ΔE is the difference of the total energy of the system before and after
increasing the length of selected bonds. These calculations were performed
for pure MV, pure model OPS system (Figure 8a), and various types of attachments of MV
to sugar rings of OPS (see Figure 8b–d). Calculation results presented in Table 4 are discussed in Section 4.5.

4.4 Molecular Dynamics Simulation
Under adsorption conditions of 20 °C, pH of 11, and OPS concentration
of 50 mg/L, we used MD simulation to further explore the adsorption
of MV by polysaccharides. In the simulation, the structure of the
OPS (Figure 5) was
modeled based on the literature.43 The
Focite module in Materials Studio software was used to calculate the
charge by QEq option. The parameter is set to QEq_charged1.0. The
parameter description is that originally generated for positive metal
ions and recommended for systems containing metal ions. We calculated
the electronegativity oxygen (in electron Volts) in the hydroxyl,
ether, and carboxyl groups of the OPS, as shown in the red fonts in Figure 5. The calculation
shows that the magnitude of oxygen electronegativity is of the order
−OH > −COOH > −O–. In a simulated
system, the number of water molecules, Fe3+, Na+, SO42–, and OH– ions were 2000, 10, 5, 15, and 5, respectively,
in accordance with the conditions of adsorption. For further exploration
of the adsorption mechanism, the number of MV molecules was set to
5, 10, 15, and 20, respectively. An amorphous model of the polysaccharide-adsorbed
MV aqueous solution is shown in Figure 6, and various substances have been noted in the figure.

Figure 5 Chemical structure of
OPS (n is set to 2 to build the OPS model in MD simulation).
Numbers in
red are the calculated electronegativity of oxygen in the hydroxyl,
ether, and carboxyl groups of OPS, respectively. Two types of sugar
rings (type I and II) were constructed as simplified OPS models in
the first-principles calculation. In each type of sugar ring, two
types of hydroxyl groups, with labels (a) and (b), are involved in
the adsorption of MV.

Figure 6 Amorphous cell within periodic boundary conditions with
MV adsorbed
by OPS in the aqueous solution in the presence of additional anions
and cations.

Binding energy (Ebind) between OPS
and MV is evaluated by total energy of the mixture and that of individual
components, as follows 8  where Etotal is the total energy of the system including all
components used in the experiment, EOPS is the total energy of the system without MV molecules, and EMV is the total energy of the system without
OPS molecules. As listed in Table 5, the results suggest that Ebind originated from the component of electrostatic interactions, Ebind(elec), is larger than Ebind and originated from the component of van der Waals
interactions, Ebind(vdW). This indicates
that the physical adsorption is dominated by electrostatic interactions.
Thus, we add more MV in the system, this leads to increased interactions
caused by hydrogen bonding and vdW forces. Further, we studied the
radial distribution function of the oxygen-containing groups in polysaccharide
and the nitrogen atoms in MV, as shown in Figure 7. The radial distribution function gAB(r) gives a measure of the
probability of where atom B is located in an atom pair of type AB
within a reference frame defined by atom A. A is located at the center
of a sphere, and B is located in the spherical shell of infinitesimal
thickness at a distance r from atom A. gAB(r) can be calculated by 9  where
⟨nAB(r)⟩
is the average number of atom pairs between r and r + Δr and ρAB is
the density of atom pairs of type AB. From Figure 7, gAB(r) of the hydroxyl system has the largest peak; hence, the
concentration of MV in the vicinity of −OH is the largest,
indicating that the adsorption to hydroxyl groups is dominant. This
is consistent with the infrared analysis and the results of DFT calculations
(Table 5).

4.5 First-Principles Modeling
Based on the results of IR measurements and MD simulations, we performed
the first-principles simulations of the interactions between the MV
molecules and the sugar rings of OPS. As the model of the OPS, we
used two types of sugar rings: one with a methyl group (type I), the
other with a carboxyl group (type II), see Figure 8a. We used this model to imitate alteration of these two groups
in sugar rings (also see Figure 5).

Figure 8 Types of sugar rings and their interactions with MV. Optimized
atomic structure of two types of sugar rings with different chemical
compositions (a). MV interacted with both types (b) or one type of
these sugar rings (c, d). Note that the sugar ring is in the front
of the page and MV is the back of the page in (d).

In the first step of our modeling, we considered
energetics of the insertion of −N+H–CH3 part of MV between two sugar rings. The binding energy is
calculated by the formula 10  where EMV is the total energy of the MV molecule, Ehost is the total energy of two sugar rings (Figure 8a), and Eproducts is the total energy of OPS + MV (Figure 8b). The value obtained in the calculations
is −45.6 kJ/mol. Because this value is about 2 times larger
than the enthalpy obtained in thermodynamics analysis (Table 3), we considered interactions
of MV with a single sugar ring (Figure 8c,d). In this case, Ehost in eq 10 is the total energy of the pair of sugar rings minus
the total energy of the sugar ring excluded from consideration. Calculated
binding energy is −14.7 kJ/mol for the interaction between
MV and the sugar ring with methyl group (Figure 8c) and −24.2 kJ/mol for the interaction
between MV and the sugar ring with carboxyl groups (Figure 8d). The average binding energy
is nearly −19 kJ/mol, which is in quantitative agreement with
the thermodynamic analysis. Note that the presence of carboxyl groups
enhances the interactions. Overall, this result is in agreement with
the IR spectroscopy measurements and MD simulations.

The next
step of our modeling was to check the influence of interactions on
the vibrational energies of selected bonds. We calculated the total
energy difference between the system with optimized atomic structure
and the same system where the length of one of the selected bonds
was increased by 0.04 Å. Listed in Table 4 are the results of the calculations demonstrating
that different types of adsorption provides different changes in C–N–R
stretching energies, which is consistent with the shift of the corresponding
peak in the IR spectra. The fact that the energy of the C=O
bond stretching in sugar rings containing carboxyl groups has changed
drastically is consistent with the disappearance of the corresponding
peak in the IR spectra of the product (MV + OPS). For O–H bond
energies, we have found that the stretching energies of the O–H
groups (type b) participating in the interactions with MV were increasing
and the stretching energies of O–H groups (type a) that does
not interact with MV were decreasing. Based on the calculations, additional
patterns in the stretching energies of the product correspond to increased
vibration modes. This is in agreement with the positive value of entropy
in Table 3.

The
last step of our modeling was to check the influence of adsorption
on optical properties of MV. Results of the calculations indicate
that each type of considered interaction between MV and sugar ring(s)
provides a shifting of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level or both (Figure 9). The nature of
this shifting is the interaction of the −N+H–CH3 part of MV with the hydroxyl group(s) of sugar rings. The
energy gap between HOMO and LUMO becomes diversified after MV is adsorbed
on OPS. This makes possible multiple transitions with different wavelengths
instead of a single dominant transition observed in MV solution (Figure 2f).

Figure 9 Total densities of states
of pure MV (red) and three considered MV + OPS structures. Interaction
of MV with two sugar rings (Figure 8b) are shown in blue, interaction of MV with the single
sugar ring containing methyl group (Figure 8c) in green, and interaction of MV with single
sugar ring containing carboxyl group (Figure 8d) in pink.

5 Conclusions
Employing
RSM, we found the optimal conditions of extracting polysaccharide
from okra (extraction time of 31 min, liquid–solid ratio of
51:1 (mL:g), and temperature of 63 °C). Based on physicochemical
analysis, average OPS molecular weight was 68 010 Da; molar
ratio of the three monosaccharides in OPS was rhamnose/galactose/glucose
= 1:0.56:0.13, and the uronic acid content was 10.71%.

Using
thermodynamic analysis, the adsorption was proved to be a thermodynamically
favored exothermic process. The results from MD simulation and first-principles
calculations reveal that the nature of this process is the physical
(dominantly electrostatic) adsorption of MV on sugar rings of OPS,
which is consistent with the infrared analysis.

This work can
be a foundation of future study on biosorbent-dye systems. Simulation
approaches used in this study can potentially be applied for further
studies of adsorption mechanism of various systems and improvement
of sorption and decolorization efficiency.
