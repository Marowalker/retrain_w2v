Heavy metal ions
in aqueous solutions are harmful to human health,
but exploring and exploiting nanoadsorbents with a high adsorption
capacity and low cost should be an effective method for overcoming
this problem. In this study, a novel nanoadsorbent termed poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-citric acid) (PNCA)
was designed and synthesized via free-radical polymerization. PNCA
exhibits good solubility in aqueous solutions and can self-assemble
into spherical nanoaggregates with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of
approximately 723.1 nm. After freeze-drying, the solid powder of PNCA
exhibited a loose porous structure. When PNCA is dissolved in water,
the resulting copolymer solution exhibits high removal rates for Cu2+ and Pb2+ of over 80%; meanwhile, over 97% of
the PNCA is precipitated with metal ions. The adsorption process of
PNCA chelated with Cu2+ ions fit the Freundlich model.
The adsorption capacity is independent of the media pH, but could
be affected by the temperature. Except for herbal medicines with alkaloids
as active ingredients, PNCA also presents good adsorption capacity
for Cu2+ in herbal medicine decoctions, with a removal
rate of over 80%. The cell cytotoxicity in vitro and system toxicity
in vivo demonstrate the desirable biosafety of PNCA. These results
suggest that PNCA with good biosafety can be utilized as a nanoadsorbent
to remove the metal ions, especially Cu2+, in different
media.

1 Introduction
Heavy metal ion contamination
represents a serious threat to human
health. Such a contamination exists in many ecological systems and
it is necessary to remove these harmful elements from water or other
aqueous solutions prior to their use.1−3 For this purpose, various
methods have been exploited, including chemical precipitation, ion-exchange,
adsorption, ultrafiltration, and reverse-osmosis techniques.4−7 Among these methods, adsorption is considered to be a facile, effective,
and economic method.8,9 Materials containing abundant
functional groups can be utilized as effective adsorbents,10−13 especially carboxyl groups, which can adsorb metal ions via chelation.14,15

Citric acid exists naturally in the human body and has been
approved
by the FDA as a food additive.16 Citric
acid contains three carboxyl groups in each molecule, and hence, it
should be applicable as an effective adsorbent to remove heavy metal
ions in aqueous solutions.17−19 However, citric acid presents
a low adsorptive efficacy based on its high water solubility. Therefore,
it is generally loaded onto a substrate for use as an adsorbent.20−22 The adsorption efficacy of such derivatives is limited due to the
low loading-efficacy of citric acid on these substrate. Hence, it
is necessary to find another method for preparing adsorbents based
on citric acid.

To enhance the removal efficiency, adsorbents
are expected to be
soluble in aqueous solutions to achieve a high specific surface area,
followed by sedimentation after chelating with heavy metal ions.23 Based on the development of nanomaterials, water-soluble
polymers have been explored and applied to the removal of heavy metal
ions from waste water, including poly(1-vinylimidazole),24 poly(vinyl amino-N,N′-bis-propane diol),25 poly(vinyl sulfonic acid),26 polyethyleneimine,27 poly(acrylic acid),28,29 poly(vinyl alcohol),30,31 and polysaccharides.32 However, this technique carries the potential
risk of secondary pollution in terms of the survival of adsorbents
in water.23 To decrease residual adsorbents
in aqueous solutions, various smart nanoadsorbents with stimuli–response
properties have been designed.33,34 In particular, thermosensitive
materials have been researched broadly based on the feasibility and
practicality of their application.

Poly(N-isopropyl
acrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a thermosensitive
nanomaterial with a low critical solution temperature of 32 °C,
which is often applied as a drug/gene carrier.35−37 When the temperature
is lower than 32 °C, PNIPAM is soluble in water in the form of
random coils based on hydrogen bonds. As the temperature increases
beyond 32 °C, hydrogen bonds are broken and PNIPAM transitions
from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, causing it to precipitate from water.38 Based on this property, PNIPAM is often utilized
as a nanoadsorbent to remove heavy metal ions and organic dyes in
waste water.39,40 Additionally, it has been reported
that the adsorption efficacy could be improved significantly by combining
acrylic acid with PNIPAM due to the chelation efficacy between carboxyl
groups and heavy metal ions.41,42 Therefore, copolymers
derived from PNIPAM and carboxyl monomers can provide an excellent
removal capacity.43,44

Based on the high removal
efficiency of citric acid and the thermoresponsibility
of PNIPAM, in this study, a thermoresponsive copolymer named poly(NIPAM-co-citric acid) (PNCA) that combines NIPAM and a trimethyl
citrate monomer (TCM) was designed and synthesized via free-radical
polymerization. The adsorption capacity, residual levels, and biosafety
of the proposed copolymer were studied. PNCA could chelate with Cu2+ and Pb2+ with a high adsorption efficacy in water.
Furthermore, PNCA also presented selective adsorption for Cu2+ in decoctions of Chinese herbal medicines. However, PNCA should
not be applied in decoctions with alkaloids as active ingredients
because the electrostatic interaction between alkaloids and PNCA is
strong, which can affect the adsorption capacity and the concentration
of the active ingredient.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Nanoadsorbents
Based
on the trimethyl citrate monomer (TCM), the proposed nanoadsorbent
poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-citric
acid) (PNCA) was synthesized via successive free-radical polymerization
and hydrolysis reactions (Scheme 1). N-Isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM)
and TCM were polymerized to prepare the copolymer poly(NIPAM-co-trimethyl citrate). Next, the copolymer was hydrolyzed
using LiOH in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/H2O (1:1, v/v) over 12 h. Following dialysis with distilled water and
freeze-drying, PNCA was obtained as a white solid.

Reagents and conditions: (a)
AIBN, DMF, 4 h, 60 °C, 92%; (b) LiOH, THF/H2O, −5
to 25 °C, 14 h, 87%.

2.2 Characterization
The structure of
PNCA was confirmed using 1H NMR spectroscopy; the signals
at 3.6–3.7 ppm were attributed to the methenyl proton of NIPAM,
the signal at 3.0 ppm was attributed to the methylene proton of citric
acid, and the signals at 1.0 ppm were attributed to the methyl proton
of the backbone and NIPAM (Scheme 1). The molar mass of PNCA was detected by GPC, which
was 155 000 (Table 1). Due to the free-radical polymerization, the molar mass
distribution of PNCA was approximately 3.2.

PNCA
presented good hydrophilic properties and could be dispersed
in distilled water indirectly to form a transparent solution. The
particle size, size distribution, and ζ-potential of the PNCA
aqueous solution with a concentration of 1 mg mL–1 were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS). It was found
that PNCA could self-assemble into nanoaggregates in aqueous solutions
with an average hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 723.1 nm (Figure 1a) and a ζ-potential
of −25.8 mV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed
that these aggregates were spherical nanoparticles with an average
diameter of approximately 210 nm (Figure 1b). The particle size was smaller when measured
by SEM than by dynamic light scattering (DLS), which was attributed
to the fact that measurement of the particle size reported the actual
diameter of the dried particles rather than the hydrodynamic diameter.45,46 Based on the thermosensitivity of NIPAM, the copolymer PNCA also
presented thermoresponsive properties; the turbidity curve is shown
in Figure 1c. PNCA
exhibited typical thermoresponsive behaviors, and its low critical
solution temperature (LCST) was approximately 43.2 °C at a concentration
of 1 mg mL–1.

aqueous solution (c). Scale bar: 2 μm.

2.3 Adsorption Efficacy in Aqueous Solutions
Heavy metal ion solutions, including Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ separately, were mixed with
citric acid solutions and PNCA solutions. No significant changes in
metal ion solutions could be observed after adding citric acid solutions,
implying that the chelates of citric acid and metal ions were difficult
to separate from the system. In contrast, the copolymer PNCA exhibited
good adsorptive properties (Figure 2a) after adding PNCA solutions; a large amount of precipitation
occurred in Cu2+ and Pb2+ solutions, and a small
amount of precipitation was observed in Cd2+ and Hg2+ solutions. These results suggested that PNCA exhibited different
adsorption efficacies for different metal ions.

in different metal ion solutions (a), the
removal rate (b), and SEM images of PNCA, the precipitation of PNCA
with Cu2+ ions, and the precipitation of PNCA with Pb2+ ions (c). Scale bar: 1 μm.

After adding 0.1 mL of PNCA solution with the concentration of
9 mg mL–1 into 1 mL of heavy metal ion solutions
with the concentration of 100 μg mL–1, including
Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ ions separately, precipitation occurred. After filtration, the concentrations
of metal ions in the filtrates were detected by ICP-Mass, and then
they were utilized to calculate the removal rates, which are presented
in Figure 2b. The concentrations
for Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ were 18.6, 8.4, 87.6, and 96.9 μg mL–1, respectively, and the removal rates were 81.4, 91.6, 12.4, and
3.1% correspondingly.

After filtration, the precipitates were
freeze-dried and their
morphologies were determined using SEM. To identify structural changes
in PNCA after chelating with heavy metal ions, the PNCA solution was
freeze-dried; the solid nanoadsorbent presented a loose porous sponge
structure (Figure 2c, PNCA). The complex of PNCA chelated with Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions presented a tight structure, the precipitate of PNCA
with Cu2+ ions exhibited a nanofiber structure (Figure 2c, PNCA + Cu2+), and the precipitate of PNCA with Pb2+ ions
exhibited a sheet-like structure (Figure 2c, PNCA + Pb2+). This phenomenon
revealed that chelation acted as a linker to induce dense macromolecule-chain-stacking
during the adsorption process, resulting in the tight structures that
were shown.

To estimate the adsorption capacity of PNCA,47 adsorption tests at 50 °C were conducted
with heavy
metal ion concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 8.0, and
10.0 mg mL–1. After heating and centrifugation,
blue precipitates were collected. The filtrate was analyzed using
ICP-Mass to estimate the concentration of residual Cu2+ ions; Ce (mmol L–1) is the concentration of Cu2+ ions in the filtrate at
equilibrium and Qe (mmol g–1) is the adsorption capacity. To determine the adsorption capacity,
the adsorption isotherms at 50 °C were investigated. As shown
in Figure 3a, the Cu2+ ion chelation efficacy of PNCA was approximately 26 mmol
g–1. Besides, according to the formulas of the Langmuir
and Freundlich model, adsorption models were estimated and two curves
were obtained (Figure 3b,c). The regression coefficient (R2)
of the Freundlich model was 0.98, which was greater than that of the
Langmuir model (R2 = 0.87), revealing
that the adsorption model of PNCA matched the Freundlich model.

model fitting curves and parameters of copper ions chelated with PNCA
(n = 3).

The adsorption capacity of adsorbents might be affected by the
media pH; therefore, it is necessary to study the influence of the
media pH on the removal rate of PNCA.47 PNCA and Cu2+ powder were dissolved in different solutions
with pH values ranging from 2 to 8. The PNCA solution (0.1 mL) was
added into 1 mL of Cu2+ ion solution, and after heating
and centrifugation, the precipitates were collected. The Cu2+ ion concentrations in the filtrate were detected by ICP-Mass, and
the adsorption capacity Qe at different
pH values was calculated (Figure 4a). As the media pH value increased from 2 to 8, the
adsorption capacity was enhanced slightly, but no significant changes
were shown, which indicated that the adsorption properties of PNCA
would not be affected significantly by the media pH; hence, PNCA could
be broadly utilized as a nanoadsorbent.

Figure 4 Influence of pH on the
adsorption properties of PNCA for Cu2+ ions (a) and the
removal rate of Cu2+ ions using
PNCA at different temperatures (b) (n = 3).

Due to the thermosensitive properties of PNCA,
the influence of
temperature on the adsorption properties of PNCA for Cu2+ ions was also studied. When a PNCA solution was added to a heavy
metal ion solution at a temperature below its LCST, no changes could
be observed during vortex. However, the precipitates appeared immediately
after heating the solution above the LCST, exhibiting a sharp change.
The adsorption capacities of PNCA at different temperatures are shown
in Figure 4b. These
results indicated that PNCA did not exhibit any significant adsorptive
capacity when the temperature was below 42 °C, whereas after
heating above 42 °C, the adsorptive capacity enhanced significantly
and was maintained at approximately 80%.

2.4 Adsorption
Efficacy in a Decoction
Although Chinese herbal medicines
only present a moderate therapeutic
efficacy, they are broadly utilized in the clinic based on their negligible
side effects. However, depending on the kind of plants, herbal medicines
could hyperaccumulate heavy metals, which could pose a severe risk
to human health. Therefore, it is necessary to remove heavy metal
ions from herbal decoctions. Based on the good removal rate of PNCA
for Cu2+ and Pb2+ in water, PNCA was applied
furthermore to remove Cu2+ and Pb2+ from a ligusticum
wallichii solution, which is a Chinese herbal medicine with ferulic
acid (FA) as its main active ingredient. The original concentrations
of Cu2+, Pb2+, and FA in the decoction were
100, 100, and 196 μg mL–1, respectively. After
adding the PNCA solution, the precipitates were shown in the decoction
and the concentrations of Cu2+ and Pb2+ decreased
to 19.9 and 28.3 μg mL–1 respectively, representing
removal rates of 80.1 and 71.7% correspondingly (Figure 5a). These results suggested
that PNCA presented a good adsorption efficacy for Cu2+ and a moderate adsorption efficacy for Pb2+ in ligusticum
wallichii decoctions. Meanwhile, the concentration of FA in the decoction
after filtration only changed slightly to 182.2 μg mL–1, representing a removal rate of 7.1%. It seemed that PNCA would
not affect the therapeutic efficacy of ligusticum wallichii significantly.

Figure 5 Removal

(a) (FA, ferulic acid); removal rate of Cu2+ ions in different
Chinese traditional medicine decoctions (b): 1, ligusticum wallichii;
2, scutellaria baicalensis; and 3, coptidis rhizome.

To evaluate the adsorption efficacy of PNCA for Cu2+ ions in other Chinese herbal medicines, scutellaria baicalensis
and coptidis rhizome decoctions were also tested (Figure 5b). The original concentration
of Cu2+ ions in these decoctions was 100 μg mL–1. After adding the PNCA solution, large amounts of
precipitates were shown in ligusticum wallichii and scutellaria baicalensis
decoctions and a small amount of precipitate was presented in coptidis
rhizome decoctions. The actual concentrations of Cu2+ ions
were 19.2, 12.2, and 86.7 μg mL–1, representing
removal rates of 80.8, 87.8, and 13.3%, respectively. Overall, PNCA
exhibited a high removal rate for Cu2+ in decoctions of
ligusticum wallichii and scutellaria baicalensis, but a low adsorption
efficacy for decoctions of coptidis rhizome. Besides, the concentrations
of active ingredients in these herbal medicine decoctions were detected
by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the results showed
that PNCA would not affect the therapeutic efficacy of ligusticum
wallichii or scutellaria baicalensis because the losses of active
ingredients in these decoctions were less than 5%. In contrast, the
active ingredient of coptidis rhizome showed a significant change,
with a loss of 33%. Based on these results, it seemed that PNCA could
not be applied to all types of herbal medicines, which could be explained
by the structure of PNCA. PNCA was formed from citric acid, indicating
that it contained many carboxyl groups that could interact with compounds
containing basic groups. In ligusticum wallichii and scutellaria baicalensis,
the active ingredients were ferulic acid and baicalin, respectively;
both of them contained carboxyl groups, revealing that the interactions
between PNCA and these active ingredients were very weak. However,
the active ingredient in coptidis rhizome was berberine, which was
an alkaloid, representing that the electrostatic interaction between
berberine and PNCA was strong, and therefore, a significant amount
of berberine was adsorbed by PNCA.

2.5 Biosafety
To estimate the effects
of PNCA on human health, the biosafety was assessed based on its in
vitro cell cytotoxicity toward HUVEC cells and in vivo animal experiments,
as the residual organic nanoadsorbents in either water or the decoction
might induce severe toxicities. The cytotoxicity in vitro against
HUVEC cells was researched via the MTT method, and the concentrations
of PNCA ranged from 1 μg mL–1 to 30 mg mL–1 (Figure 6a). The cell viability was over 80% when the concentration
of PNCA was less than 0.5 mg mL–1, revealing that
PNCA did not show significant cell cytotoxicity. Although the highest
concentration of PNCA was 0.9 mg mL–1 in these adsorptive
experiments, after chelating with Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions, nearly all of the nanoadsorbent was precipitated. Based on
the weight of precipitates, the residual amount of PNCA in the aqueous
solution was <3%; hence, the concentration was <0.03 mg mL–1, resulting in a cell viability greater than 90%.
These results suggested that nanoadsorbent PNCA exhibited an acceptable
biosafety in vitro.

Figure 6 Cytotoxicity of PNCA against HUVEC cells after incubation
for 48
h (a); mice body weight change curves after treatment with different
concentrations of PNCA (b).

Besides, normal Balb/c mice were utilized to estimate the systemic
toxicity of PNCA in vivo. The mice were randomly divided into six
groups and then administered with a normal saline solution (blank
control group) or with PNCA in the normal saline solution with concentrations
ranging from 5 to 400 mg kg–1 (test groups). The
mice were monitored every day, and their body weights were recorded
every 2 days. The body weights of the test groups showed no significant
differences compared to that of the blank control group (Figure 6b). During the entire
procedure, no weight loss, signs of distress (unresponsiveness, labored
breathing, discharge), or death were observed, revealing the low systemic
toxicity of PNCA.

3 Conclusions
A nanoadsorbent
based on NIPAM and citric acid was designed and
synthesized via free-radical polymerization with a high yield. The
resulting PNCA presented good solubility in water and could self-assemble
into spherical nanoaggregates with a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately
723.1 nm. PNCA exhibited a good adsorption efficacy toward Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions in aqueous solutions with removal
rates greater than 80%. Additionally, over 97% of the PNCA precipitated
with metal ions; hence, the residual PNCA in the filtrate was <3%.
PNCA presented a good adsorption efficacy of Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions not only in aqueous solutions but also in Chinese medicine
decoctions, especially for Cu2+ ions, with a removal rate
of 81%. Although PNCA presented a good adsorption efficacy in decoctions,
it was not suitable for herbal medicines with alkaloids as active
ingredients because the carboxyl groups in PNCA could interact with
alkaloids via electrostatic interactions. PNCA revealed good biosafety,
and no cell cytotoxicity in vitro or system toxicity in vivo was shown.
These results suggested that PNCA with good biosafety could be utilized
as a nanomaterial to remove metal ions, particularly Cu2+, from various media.

in DMSO-d6 or in D2O at room
temperature. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were
carried out on a Shimadzu GPC LC20 instrument with a single-column
set equipped with an RID-20 refractive index detector and water (containing
0.1 N NaNO3 and 0.06% NaN3) as the eluent at
35 °C. Calibration was performed with PEO standards.

4.5 Dynamic Light-Scattering Analysis
Particle sizes and
size distributions of the PNCA aqueous solutions
were detected by dynamic light scattering. These measurements were
conducted by a Zetasizer Nano-ZS analyzer (Malvern Instruments, U.K.).
The concentration of the PNCA solution was 1 mg mL–1, and all experiments were carried out in triplicate.

4.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy
An energy-dispersive
spectrometer (SEM-EDS; S-4800, Hitachi) was utilized to investigate
the morphologies of nanoadsorbents and precipitation. After freeze-drying,
these samples were placed on a matrix and then sputter-coated with
a conductive layer of gold–palladium (Au/Pd) for 1 min. A 30
mV potential was used for observation.

4.7 Adsorption
Measurement
The aqueous
solution (0.1 mL) of citric acid (CA, 9 mg mL–1)
or PNCA (9 mg mL–1) was added to 1 mL of metal ion
solution (100 μg mL–1) containing Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+. The mixture
was heated and the precipitates formed. After centrifugation and filtration,
the precipitates were freeze-dried and weighted, and the metal ion
concentrations in the filtrates were detected by ICP-Mass.

The
aqueous solution (0.1 mL) of PNCA (3 mg mL–1) was
added to 1 mL of Cu2+ ion solutions (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 8.0, and 10.0 mg mL–1). The mixtures
were then heated and the precipitates formed. After centrifugation
and filtration, the Cu2+ ion concentrations in the filtrates
were detected by ICP-Mass.

The aqueous solution (0.1 mL) of
PNCA (3 mg mL–1) was added to 1 mL of Cu2+ ion solution (0.25 mg mL–1) with the pH value
ranging from 2 to 8. The mixtures
were then heated and the precipitates formed. After centrifugation
and filtration, the Cu2+ ion concentrations in the filtrates
were detected by ICP-Mass.

The aqueous solution (0.1 mL) of
PNCA (3 mg mL–1) was added to 1 mL of Cu2+ ion solutions (0.25 mg mL–1) with the temperature
ranging from 38 to 48 °C.
After centrifugation and filtration, the Cu2+ ion concentrations
in the filtrates were detected by ICP-Mass.

All samples were
diluted with 2–5% nitric acid and the filtrates
were analyzed by an ICP spectrometer (Agilent ICPOES 730). The radio-frequency
power was set to 15 L min–1, the carrier gas was
argon, the plasma flow was 15 L min–1, the auxiliary
gas flow was set to 1.5 L min–1, and the nebulizer
gas flow was 0.75 L min–1. The axial observation
detection mode with a linear calibration type was used. The viewing
height and grating order were adjusted for each metal ion. Standard
solutions were prepared at five different concentrations and a quality
control standard was tested after every 15 samples. The wavelengths
for each metal analyzed were 327.39 nm for copper, 220.35 nm for lead,
and 226.50 nm for cadmium. The adsorptive capacities (Qe) and removal rates were calculated as follows:    where Co is the
initial concentration of Cu2+ ions, Ce is the actual concentration of Cu2+ ions in the
filtrate at equilibrium, V is the volume of the filtrate,
and W is the weight of the adsorbents.

4.8 XRD
X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD)
was used to determine the compositions of the samples, using a Japan
D/Max 2500PC X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a 2θ
range between 3 and 80° and a graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation
source (λ = 1.54 Å) operating at 40 kV and 100 mA (scanning
rate of 8° min–1). The XRD patterns were recorded
at 25 °C.

4.9 Biosafety Testing
The in vitro cytotoxicity
of PNCA toward a HUVEC cell line was assessed using an MTT assay.
Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 100 units mL–1 of penicillin G
and streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and seeded in
96-well plates at a density of 104 cells per well. Prior
to treatment with the PNCA solution, the cells were incubated for
24 h, and then the cultural medium was changed to fresh RPMI-1640.
After treatment with various formulations and culturing for another
48 h, 20 μL of MTT solution (5 mg mL–1 in
PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Subsequently, the
medium was removed and 200 μL of DMSO was added into each well
to dissolve the blue formazan crystals, and the absorbance was measured
at 570 nm. The cell inhibition rate was calculated as follows: cell
inhibition = (1 – ODtreated/ODcontrol) × 100%, where ODtreated was the value after treatment
with the PNCA solution and ODcontrol was the value after
treatment with the culture medium

The normal BALB/c mice were
randomly divided into six groups (10 mice per group); mice were treated
with normal saline (control group) or PNCA with different concentrations
(test group) via gastrointestinal administration. The body weights
of the mice were monitored as an index of systemic toxicity.

4.10 Statistical Analysis
All experiments
were conducted in at least triplicate (at least three independent
experiments). Data were presented as mean values ± SD. Comparisons
between groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance (SPSS
19.0), P < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.
