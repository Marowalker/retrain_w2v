In terms of solar hydrogen production, semiconductor-based
photocatalysts via p–n heterojunctions play a key role in enhancing future hydrogen reservoir.
The present work focuses on the successful synthesis and characterization
of a novel p-MoS2/n-CeO2 heterojunction photocatalyst
for excellent performance toward solar hydrogen production. The synthesis
involves a simple in situ hydrothermal process by varying the wt %
of MoS2. The various characterization techniques support
the uniform distribution of CeO2 on the surface of crumpled
MoS2 nanosheets, and the formation of p–n heterojunction
is further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and Mott–Schottky
analysis. Throughout the experiment, it is demonstrated that 2 wt
% MoS2 in the MoS2/CeO2 heterojunction
photocatalyst exhibits the highest rate of hydrogen evolution with
a photocurrent density of 721 μA cm–2. The
enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the formation of the
p–n heterojunction that provides an internal electric field
to facilitate the photogenerated charge separation and transfer.

Introduction
Development
of a visible-light-driven photocatalyst to produce hydrogen by water
splitting using solar energy is an attractive environmentally friendly
method, which offers a way for capturing available solar energy and
converting it into hydrogen.1 Although
many photocatalysts capable of splitting water have been developed,
most of them are oxides.1c,2 CeO2 is one
of the widely accepted metal oxide photocatalysts, which have been
studied over more than decades. Its high chemical stability, nontoxicity,
and low cost make
it a promising candidate like TiO2 and ZnO.3 However, the application of CeO2 as a photocatalyst
is hindered by some of the drawbacks, that is, wide band gap, narrow
light absorption ability, and high recombination rate.4 Thus, more studies have been performed demonstrating improvement in the photocatalytic activity
by strategies such as band gap engineering, doping, physical property
tuning, and making suitable active site availability. But one of the
most effective strategies is the development of a heterostructure
instead of designing impurity doping. Combining a wide-band-gap material
with a smaller-band-gap semiconductor such as metal dichalcogenides harvests a broader-spectrum
absorption of solar energy and promotes charge separation.5,3c

Recent studies introduced functional two-dimensional (2D)
layered-structured
graphene analogous materials, such as MoS2, as a photocatalyst,
which have attracted considerable attention in the fields of energy
technology, photonics, nanoelectronics, and materials science by virtue
of their unique material properties, unique chemical and electronic
properties, efficient cocatalytic supports, suitable band gaps, and
diverse applications.6 MoS2 is
a layered-structured material designed from Mo atoms sandwiched between
two layers of hexagonally close-packed S atoms with a stoichiometry
of MoS2. Because of a weak van der Waals gap between layers,
it can be exfoliated into single- or few-layered nanosheet-like graphene,
which has various applications in Li-ion batteries, sensing, phototransistors,
and photocatalytic hydrogen production.7 More importantly, MoS2 is considered as a better substitute
for noble metals (such as Pt, Rh, Ru, Pd) as well as a low-cost cocatalyst
for both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic H2 evolution
due to the existence of highly exposed edges derived from the MoS2 crystal layers.8 Although it possesses
many fascinating properties, alone it is inactive toward the solar-light-driven
hydrogen evolution reaction.8e Thus, many
studies have been conducted by taking MoS2 either as a
cocatalyst or as a component in heterojunction-based materials.9 But heterojunction photocatalyst materials are
considered to be the most promising candidates because they provide
a potential driving force, which facilitates the separation of photoexcited
charge carriers, dominates the transfer direction, increases the contact
interface, and accelerates the rate of charge transfer within the
heterojunction compartment.10,2f,3c The construction of heterojunctions make the hydrogen evolution
mechanism easier by developing the typical type-II heterostructure
mode because of the staggered band gap structure between the two semiconductors
followed by enhancing the overall energy conversion efficiency.2e,3b The p-type MoS2 has been reported in many literature
reports and shows better results toward both photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic
H2 evolution. The p-type behavior of MoS2 is
attributed to its good electronic properties; narrow band gap, which
broadens the visible light response; high thermal stability; large
specific surface area; and electrostatic integrity. Hence, it results
in good photogenerated charge transfer through the intimate contact
of the heterojunction, increasing the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Yuan et al. developed a 2D–2D nanojunction
between MoS2 and TiO2 and tested the photocatalytic
water reduction reaction.9a A number of
studies have been reported for enhancing the photocatalytic performance
due to heterojunctions such as n-BiVO4-MoS2,11 MoS2-MoO3/CdS,12 MoS2/CdS,13 and MoS2/N-RGO/CdS.14

Among different nanocomposite heterojunctions, the
p–n heterojunction
between two semiconductors has been reported as the most challenging
and effective photocatalytic material because it generates
a space charge region, which is due to the depletion of electrons
from the n-type semiconductor and holes from the p-type semiconductor
near that region.13 The present photocatalytic
scheme suggests a p–n heterojunction nanocomposite photocatalyst
considering MoS2 as a p-type semiconductor and CeO2 as an n-type semiconductor, and this will give an intimate
contact area, which may promote the photogenerated charge carriers
at the interface of the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite.
Gong et al. have reported a MoS2/CeO2 hybrid
core–shell nanostructure, which shows enhanced catalytic activity
in ammonia decomposition toward H2 production.15 Again, Li and his co-workers constructed a CeO2@MoS2 core–shell nanocomposite, which plays a better role
in symmetric supercapacitors.16 In addition
the other work reported by Li et al. in which a ternary attapulgite–CeO2/MoS2 nanocomposite was designed, which activity is fabricated by degrading dibenzothiophene in gasoline
under visible light irradiation.17 From
the foregoing discussion, it is concluded that there is no such reported
H2 evolution via heterojunction photocatalysts for the
MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite.

In this work,
we have successfully coupled n-type CeO2 with layered p-type
MoS2 in a 2D heterojunction fashion
through a facile hydrothermal method. In addition, the coupled heterojunction exhibits an intimate
junction between n-CeO2 and p-MoS2, which we
have confirmed from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Mott–Schottky
plots. The improved charge transfer and separation across the p–n
junction is mainly responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic water-splitting
activity under simulated solar irradiation.

Results and Discussion
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of the as-synthesized
semiconductor photocatalyst was employed to certify the phase, crystal
structure, composition, and purity. The XRD patterns of pristine MoS2, CeO2, and the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite are shown in Figure 1. It was detected that the peaks at 2θ of 28.49,
33.01, 47.42, and 56.25 represent the planes (111), (200), (220),
and (311), respectively, with the corresponding d-spacing values of 3.12, 2.71, 1.92, and 1.63 Å, which revealed
the cubic structure of CeO2 (which can be correlated to
TEM images). This is in a good agreement with the JCPDS file no. 34-0394.18 The characteristic diffraction peaks shown by
MoS2 indexed to the (002), (004), (100), (103), (105),
and (110) planes are of 2H hexagonal MoS2, which satisfies
the JCPDS no. 37-1492.19 There was no other
prominent peak present which implied good crystallinity and high purity
of the sample. Interestingly, it was unambiguous that the intensity
of typical peaks of CeO2 in the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite increased significantly and became slightly
sharp after loading the various weight percentages of MoS2. This could be due to increase in the crystallinity of CeO2 nanoparticles with the increase in the loading amount of MoS2. However, no characteristic patterns of MoS2 were
examined in the XRD spectra of as-synthesized MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposites, probably owing to the low MoS2 content and fine dispersion of MoS2 on the surface of
CeO2 nanoparticles in the MoS2/CeO2 photocatalyst. It was also noted that the peaks at 2θ of 28.49,
33.01, and 47.42 assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) planes slightly
shifted toward a lower Bragg’s 2θ angle after introduction
of MoS2, which concluded the synergistic interaction between
MoS2 with CeO2.20

spectra of MoS2, CeO2, and the 2% MoS2/CeO2 composite.

TEM measurements were further performed to analyze the morphological characteristics
of the sample. The TEM image of CeO2 from Figure 2a clearly displayed the formation
of nanoparticles with an average lateral particle size of 25–30
nm. The inset of Figure 2a illustrates the well-defined fringes with lattice spacing d = 0.31 nm corresponding to the (111) plane of cubic CeO2.15 The TEM image of MoS2 indicating the exfoliated nanosheets, which are crumpled together,
is shown in Figure 2b.19Figure 2c depicts the distribution of CeO2 nanoparticles (yellow framed portion) on crumpled MoS2 nanosheets. However, hexagonal CeO2 nanoparticles were
not clearly visible due to wrapping of MoS2 nanosheets
around these nanoparticles. In the high-resolution TEM image, the
presence of both CeO2 and MoS2 fringes indicated
the effective formation of heterojunction. A clear lattice fringe
of approximately 0.62 nm is ascribed to the (002) plane of MoS2, and another set of fringes with an interplanar distance
of about 0.31 nm corresponds to the (111) lattice plane of CeO2.7a The energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) pattern of the as-synthesized composite photocatalyst is shown
in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information,
which depicted the successful intimate interaction of CeO2 on the sheet of crumpled MoS2 that facilitates the separation of photogenerated
charge carriers. Furthermore, the corresponding EDX pattern showed
the presence of low concentration of MoS2 because it is
about only 2%.

and (d) fringe pattern of the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to explore
the surface chemical environmental composition as well as the valence
state of the various elements present in the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite sample. Figure 3 shows the core-level XPS peaks of the 2% MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite. All of the binding energies were
measured by taking the C 1s peak of surface adventitious carbon at
284.9 eV as the reference body in the instrument whose presence was
confirmed in the survey spectra of XPS.11 The binding energy measurement evaluates the bonding information
and elementary composition of samples. The XPS survey spectrum shown
in Figure 3a indicated
the existence of Mo, S, Ce, and O, which are the constituent elements
of the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite material. XPS
scan spectra of individual components present in the as-obtained nanocomposite
photocatalyst are also mentioned in Figure 3. The indication of reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ in the formation of MoS2 from the
Mo precursor was confirmed from the XPS spectra of Mo 3d (Figure 3b) for which the
doublet binding energies were obtained at 233.0 and 229.9 eV for 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 in the 2% MoS2/CeO2 sample, respectively.6c,21 The sulfur in MoS2 is present as sulfide S2– with 1.69% atomic
concentration. From Figure 3c, it could be obvious that after deconvolution Ce reflects
two sets of core-level XPS spectra, one type for 3d5/2 (880–900
eV) and another set for 3d3/2 (900–920 eV). As demonstrated
in Figure 3c, multiple
splitting of both the spin states, that is, 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, of Ce belongs to the mixed valence state, such as the
Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states, owing to its
nonstochiometric nature. The multiple d-splitting displays XPS peaks
at 916.4 and 898.04 eV for Ce4+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively, corresponding to the two main characteristic
XPS peaks of Ce, and the peaks located at 900.5 and 881.9 eV belong
to Ce3+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively.
In addition, other three satellite peaks were observed for Ce3+ 3d3/2 at 907.1 and for Ce3+ 3d5/2 at 888.7 and 885.1 eV.22

Figure 3 XPS spectra
of the 2% MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite:
survey spectrum (a), Mo 3d (b), Ce 3d (c), and O 1s (d).

The XPS peaks of the O 1s in nanocomposite demonstrated
in Figure 2d contain
three core-level
types of oxygen peaks. The lower binding energy at 529.1 eV corresponds
to the lattice oxygen (OI) and the higher binding energy
at 532.5 eV indicates the core-level oxygen (OIII). It
suggests the chemisorbed oxygen forming the O–H radical after
dissociation from the superoxide ion. In addition to the above two
oxygen peaks, there is another core-level O 1s peak (OII) obtained at the binding energy of 530.24 eV, which describes the
presence of oxygen vacancy in the lattice site of CeO2 nanoparticles.22a

The optical absorption properties and
the electronic structural
features of the as-prepared neat and composite samples were studied
by recording ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance
spectra. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the neat
and composite samples with different amounts of MoS2 are
shown in Figure 4.
Pristine CeO2 showed a sharp fundamental absorption peak
at about 430 nm, and it was noticed that the intensity of the absorption
peaks of composite samples rises as more amount of MoS2 was exposed to the surface of CeO2. It may be due to
the black color of MoS2. As the loading content of MoS2 in the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite increases,
there was a notable change in the absorbance intensity edge of the
composites, which was in good agreement with color changes from light
yellow to light brown.6b In addition, the
band edge potential of the samples was calculated by the Schuster–Kubelka–Munk
equation and all composites show a direct band gap similar to that
of neat CeO2.23 The band gap
energy of neat CeO2 and MoS2 corresponding to
the energy at about 2.97 (absorption at around 430 nm) and 1.89 eV,
respectively, is shown in Figure S2a,b.
Thus, the introduction of MoS2 into the composite may facilitate
the improvement of the charge separation and show full visible spectrum
absorption.

Figure 4 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of neat CeO2, neat MoS2, and MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite.

Generally, the photocatalytic
activity of photocatalysts is related
to their band structure. Thus, the corresponding band edge positions
of both CeO2 and MoS2 were estimated from the
following equation.  Herein, X is the geometric
mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms present in
a semiconductor, Ee is the energy of free
electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV), and Eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor.24 The X values for CeO2 and MoS2 are calculated to be 5.578 and 5.32 eV, respectively.
From this equation, EVB of CeO2 and MoS2 were calculated to be 2.56 and 1.76 eV, respectively,
and the corresponding ECB positions were
calculated to be −0.41 for CeO2 and −0.13
for MoS2.

Photocatalytic Activity via H2 Evolution Measurement
and Mechanism
The photocatalytic activities of CeO2 and the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite were performed
for hydrogen
evolution through the water-splitting reaction, in the presence of
methanol as the sacrificial hole scavenger at ambient temperature
and atmospheric pressure. There is no evolution of H2 gas
in the absence of light as well as catalyst. Figure 5a shows the hydrogen evolution rate of different
wt % loadings of MoS2 onto CeO2. The pure CeO2 sample shows an extremely poor photocatalytic H2 evolution (proceeding without the use of a UV cutoff filter) rate
of around 8.93 μmol h–1 due to the large band
gap of about 2.97 eV (restricted only to the UV range) and faster
recombination of the photogenerated charge carrier.4 Again, pure MoS2 itself is very much inactive
toward solar-light-driven hydrogen evolution, which may be due to
the low carrier density. Figure 5a reflects the considerable increase in the H2 evolution rate of the MoS2/CeO2 composite
than that of neat CeO2. This study displayed the effect
of loading and also intimate heterojunction between CeO2 and MoS2, which facilitates high separation efficiency
and effective channelization of photogenerated charge carriers. As
a consequence, the formation of the MoS2/CeO2 grain boundary and heterojunction can also be seen in the TEM images
shown in Figure 2d
and the heterojunction facilitates the electron transfer between the
two compartments to improve the photocatalytic H2 evolution
activity.10a H2 evolution trend
increased remarkably up to 2% of MoS2 loading and then
decreased gradually afterward for 3 and 5%, which is in accordance
with the photoluminescence (PL) study. Moreover, CeO2 shows
H2 evolution rates of 312.2 and 477.22 μmol h–1 when the loading
amounts of MoS2 are 0.5 and 1%, respectively. In the present
study, 2 wt % of MoS2 shows the highest H2 evolution
rate (508.44 μmol h–1), which is 57 times
better than that of neat CeO2. Afterward, the H2 evolution rate decreased when the loading amount of MoS2 exceeded 2 wt %, and this phenomenon can be ascribed to the intensive
absorption of light by the large black color MoS2, which
shields the active sites on the surface of the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite.25 This is in good
agreement with the absorption spectra shown in Figure 4. The hydrogen evolution values shown by
3 and 5 wt % MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite are 338.96
and 223.01 μmol h–1, respectively, which are
quite smaller than the other loading percentages of MoS2. However, about ±2% error has been found throughout the experiments.
In addition to the photocatalytic activity of the sample, it is necessary
to explore the stability of the photocatalyst in the practical experiment.
To investigate the stability of the photocatalyst, a recycle study
of hydrogen evolution was performed under the same reaction conditions. Figure 5b shows the recyclability
of hydrogen evolution of the best performing 2 wt % MoS2/CeO2 photocatalyst of three times with a time induction
period of 2 h. Even after 6 h of the reaction in three repeated cycles,
there is no decrease of H2 evolution, suggesting the photostability
of the catalyst.

Figure 5 Rate of H2 production of neat CeO2 and the
MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite with various amounts
of MoS2 loading (a) and the cycling test for H2 evolution of the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite with
2 wt % MoS2 (b).

The PL and Nyquist (electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS))
spectra
of the as-prepared MoS2, CeO2, and MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite samples were recorded to investigate
the enhanced photocatalytic activity, which may be due to the synergistic
effect of few-layered MoS2 loading on the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite.

PL spectroscopy was mainly
carried out to know the recombination
rate of photogenerated excitons, such as electrons and holes. The
sharp intensity of PL spectra depends upon the rate of recombination
of photogenerated excitons. It has been observed that the higher the
recombination rate of electron/hole pairs the higher the PL emission.
From PL spectra, we can also extract the idea about the generation,
migration, and separation efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers
in a number of semiconductor photocatalysts.26Figure 6 shows the
PL spectra of the pure and composite samples under the same conditions
with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. A strong blue emission peak
is observed at 427.5 nm, and the existence of this peak is due to
the formation of an extra surface defect energy level between the
O 2p and Ce 4f band levels. It is observed that the sharpness of the
peak falls down as the amount of the loading percentage of MoS2 increases, competing with the neat CeO2. This
trend is followed up to 2 wt % MoS2 on CeO2; afterward, there
is an increase in the peak intensity with an increase in the loading
percentage of MoS2, that is, for 3 and 5 wt %, which may
be due to the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.
Zhao et al. have observed similar types of PL behavior for n-BiVO4@P-MoS2 toward photocatalytic reduction and oxidation.10b The suppression of PL peak in the 2 wt % MoS2/CeO2 photocatalyst may be due to the efficient
interfacial electron transfer between the excited CeO2 energy
level and MoS2. The 2 wt % MoS2/CeO2 composite showed the highest
photocatalytic activity, which is in good agreement with the above
PL observation. The above study results in a better charge separation
in the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite, leaving more
redox excitons, which enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in
nanocomposite samples.

Figure 6 PL emission spectra of neat CeO2 and various
nanocomposites.

Figure 7a shows
the Nyquist (EIS) plots of CeO2 and MoS2/CeO2 at zero biasing. Generally the plots are composed of a line
in the lower-frequency region and a semicircle in a high-frequency
region. The smaller the semicircle diameter, the smaller the interfacial
charge transfer resistance and thus the higher the charge transfer
and separation efficiency and the higher the electrical conductivity
of the materials. In this case, a reduction in the semicircle diameter
depicts that the resistance offered for the charge transportation
is decreased significantly by adding MoS2 in CeO2. Meanwhile, the straight-line portion of the plot is smaller for
the composite than that for CeO2, which indicates the short
diffusion path length of ions in the electrolyte.6a,27

(a) and the polarization curve for neat CeO2 and the 2%
MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite (b).

In general, MoS2 does not give any trace
amount of H2 in powdered photocatalysis, and the high-band-gap CeO2 gives a very low amount of
H2 gas from photocatalytic water splitting. But the combination
of MoS2 and CeO2 gave a much higher value of
hydrogen evolution than that of their individual component. This enhanced
photocatalytic performance may be due to the formation of an effective
junction, which efficiently favors electron transfer as well as separation
across the interface of MoS2/CeO2, which has
good agreement with the Nyquist and PL plots. To gain more insight
into the mechanism, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots were acquired for CeO2 and 2 wt % MoS2/CeO2 in 0.1 M NaOH with light irradiation (Figure 7b). The plot reflects the cathodic photocurrent
for the reduction of protons at the electrode surface, and it was
found that the onset potential for the CeO2 electrode was
−0.45 V (vs Ag/AgCl), whereas the onset potential was decreased
to −0.20 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for the 2 wt % MoS2/CeO2 electrode. The significant reduction in the onset potential
for H+ reduction and high photocurrent density of 721 μA
cm–2 of the 2 wt % MoS2/CeO2 composite compared to that of CeO2 can be attributed
to the formation of an effective junction between the two materials,
thus improving the electron transfer rate and facilitating charge
separation.28

On the basis of all
of the above observations, we illustrate the
mechanistic pathway for the MoS2/CeO2 heterostructure,
as shown in Figure 9. The n-type conductivity of CeO2 and p-type conductivity
behavior of MoS2 were investigated from the Mott–Schottky
plot, as shown in Figure S3a,b. From the
figure, the slope for CeO2 is found to be low, whereas
the slope for MoS2 is very high, which implies the low
carrier density and poor conductivity of MoS2,13 and they have shown
type-I heterojunction before contact. The Fermi level of CeO2 is higher than that of MoS2, as shown in Figure 9a. But when a contact is formed between CeO2 and MoS2, the electrons from CeO2 with a higher
Fermi level will migrate toward the lower Fermi level of MoS2 until both the Fermi levels come into symmetry, as shown in Figure 9b. After equilibrium
is attained between the Fermi levels of both p-MoS2 and n-CeO2, the internal electric field in the p–n junction region
leads to a potential difference at the interfaces of MoS2/CeO2, with its field direction from n-type CeO2 to p-type MoS2.2929 To validate this fact, we have acquired Mott–Schottky
plots, which show the presence of both positive (p-MoS2) and negative (n-CeO2) slopes, attributed to the presence
of p–n junctions,12 as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Mott–Schottky
plot of the 2% MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite.

Under solar light irradiation,
both CeO2 and MoS2 will excite and produce photogenerated
electrons and holes
in their corresponding conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB),
respectively. After the formation of p–n junction, the band
bending was observed and the CB position of MoS2 shifted upward
than that of CeO2. The band bending was because of the
differences in the work functions of CeO2 and MoS2, and it is mainly due to MoS2 because its carrier density
is very low as compared to that of CeO2.13 Thus, the photogenerated electrons from MoS2 are transferred to the lower-positioned CB of CeO2 and
simultaneously holes from the VB of CeO2 are migrated toward
the higher-potential VB of MoS2, as shown in Figure 9c. Thus, the photogenerated electrons and holes remain separated
due to the existence of an internal electric field formed by the p–n
junction. Therefore, the highly reducible electrons are transferred
to the surface of CeO2 where they reduced the adsorbed
water to H2; similarly, holes are quenched by methanol
on the surface of MoS2. This phenomenon leads to an enhanced
separation of photoexcitons, which suppresses the recombination process
and enhances the overall photoactivity.

Conclusions
In summary, a facile in situ hydrothermal technique
was proposed
to successfully synthesize the novel MoS2/CeO2 heterojunction nanocomposite for photocatalytic H2 production
under visible light irradiation. The various characterizations firmly
supported the formation of the MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposite,
in which CeO2 nanoparticles were uniformly decorated on
the surface of MoS2 sheet. Optimizing the overall experiment,
it was demonstrated that the 2 wt % MoS2/CeO2 heterojunction nanocomposite showed the highest rate of H2 evolution of 508.44 μmol h–1, which is about
57 times more than that of neat CeO2. For the better enhancement
of the hydrogen evolution rate, the band alignment parameters play
a key role via the p–n heterojunction, which provides a large
intimate and contact interface between MoS2 and CeO2. Moreover, the designed p–n junction mechanism facilitates
easier separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers such
as electrons and holes. In the present work, the MoS2/CeO2 heterojunction-type nanocomposite photocatalyst toward solar-driven
H2 evolution has been constructed for the first time, which
provides a simple, cost-effective, ecofriendly technique and good
interface engineering for developing highly efficient photocatalysts
with potential applications in solar hydrogen generation.

Experimental
Section
In this study, all of the chemicals were of analytical
grade and
were utilized without further purification. Double-distilled water
was used in all experiments.

Synthesis of the Photocatalyst
Preparation
of CeO2 Nanoparticles
The CeO2 nanoparticles
were synthesized via a simple precipitation
method. In a typical procedure, a mixture of an aqueous solution of
cerium nitrate hexahydrate (2.1713 g), hexamethylenetetramine (HMT,
1.4162 g), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 1.4564 g) was prepared
in deionized water. A mixed solution containing 5 mL of HMT, 100 mL
of deionized water, and 100 mL of the Ce(NO3)3·6H2O solution was taken in a round bottom flask
and heated up to 80 °C for 6 h. Then, 50 mL of SDS was added
to the aforementioned solution and further heated up to 2 h. After
the completion of the reaction, the precipitates were centrifuged and washed with distilled
water followed by ethanol several times. The resulting white powder
was dried under vacuum at room temperature (RT).18

Preparation of the MoS2/CeO2 Heterojunction
Photocatalyst
The 2D MoS2/CeO2 heterojunction
photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by a one-step in situ
hydrothermal reaction of the as-harvested ceria nanoparticle powders
with an aqueous solution containing sodium molybdate dihydrate and
thiourea. The various weight percentage ratios of MoS2 to
CeO2 were 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5. In a typical synthesis process,
0.5 g of the above prepared CeO2 was dispersed in 60 mL
of aqueous solution consisting of 1 mmol (0.007 g) Na2MoO4·2H2O and 5 mmol (0.011 g) thiourea under
ultrasonication for about 30 min. Next, the resulting homogeneous
mixture suspension was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless
steel autoclave and held at 210 °C for 24 h in an electric oven.
After naturally cooled down to RT, the resultant precipitates were
separated via centrifugation and thoroughly washed three times with
distilled water followed by ethanol and dried in an oven at 80 °C
for 12 h to obtain the x wt % 2D MoS2/CeO2 photocatalyst composite (where x = 0.5,
1, 2, 3, 5). In addition, MoS2 was prepared by adopting
the same reaction conditions in the absence of CeO2.

Material Characterization
XRD characterization was done with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 0.15418 nm) at a scan rate of 0.05° min–1 from 10 to 80° following 40 kV of accelerating voltage and
30 mA of applied current. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum
was obtained using a JASCO V-750 spectrophotometer in the wavelength
range of 200–800 nm, and BaSO4 was used as a standard
reference material. By using a JASCO FP-8300 spectrofluorometer, the
PL properties were evaluated, with an excitation wavelength of 340
nm. XPS characterization was done using a system consisting of a charge
neutralizer and an Al Kα X-ray monochromatization source. TEM
images were acquired and elemental mapping was performed on a Philips
TECNAI G2 electron microscope operated at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. All photoelectrochemical studies were carried out
on IVIUMnSTAT, and the working electrode was prepared through an electrophoretic
deposition technique using FTO as the conducting substrate. The respective
counter and reference electrodes taken were Pt and Ag/AgCl. A 300
W Xe lamp was used as the light source. The Nyquist plot was acquired
at 105–100 Hz at a zero bias in 0.1 M Na2SO4. The Mott–Schottky measurement was made at
500 Hz under dark conditions in 0.5 M H2SO4,
whereas LSV plots were evaluated by sweeping the potential from 0
to −1.5 in a 0.1 M NaOH solution as the electrolyte.

Photocatalytic
Water-Splitting Setup
The total reaction
setup was mainly carried out in a 100 mL sealed
quartz batch reactor round bottom flask and the 150 W xenon arc lamp
(>400 nm) as the irradiated source followed by 1 M NaNO2 as the UV cutoff filter was positioned 20 cm away from the aqueous
suspension. The photocatalytic water-splitting mechanism was examined
by dispersing 20 mg of the as-synthesized powdered catalyst into 20
mL of the aqueous solution of methanol with constant stirring to maintain
the uniformity of the suspension throughout the reaction. Prior to
light irradiation, N2 gas was evacuated for 30 min through
the reactor for complete removal of all dissolved oxygen. The amount
of hydrogen gas evolved can be thoroughly measured by collecting the
gas via the downward displacement of water and analyzed by gas chromatography.
