To
enrich an acid-tolerant methanogenic culture used as bioaugmented
seed under acidic conditions, we operated four semicontinuous digesters
under various conditions of pH decline for producing methane at pH
5.0. 16S rRNA amplification was performed to unravel the association
between declining pH and microbiome succession. The findings demonstrated
that a gradual decrease of pH, at a step size of 0.5, and a prolonged
run time at each pH could achieve a suitable microbial culture, in
which acetoclastic Methanothrix and
hydrogenotrophic Methanolinea represented
the dominant methanogens. In contrast, a sharp decline in pH could
result in heavy loss of the acetoclastic methanogen Methanothrix, leading to a cessation of methane production.
Hydrogenotrophic methanogens exhibited high acid tolerance, and Methanospirillum could thrive despite a sudden low-pH
shock. Although Methanolinea required
a longer time to enrich, it played a substantial role in methane production
under an acidic environment.

1 Introduction
Anaerobic digestion (AD)
is an effective technology for organic
waste treatment and bioenergy generation.1 A large number of AD plants have been established worldwide; however,
some exhibit low economic efficiency, which is generally attributed
to methane yields because of operational challenges and poor management
practices.2 Hence, various intensification
approaches have been applied to enhance the methane production of
digesters, such as pretreatments to increase the hydrolysis rate of
complex waste;3 codigestion to adjust the
carbon/nitrogen ratio of feedstock;4 optimization
of the reactor configuration and operating parameters to increase
the organic loading rate;5 and dosing with
trace elements to stimulate microbial activity,6 along with the addition of special strains or mixed cultures
into the digesters to accelerate the catabolism of specific compounds,7 which is known as bioaugmentation. Over the past
decade, bioaugmentation has been undertaken in the remediation of
soils,8 as well as in wastewater treatment
to enhance removal efficiency.7 In recent
years, bioaugmentation has also been applied to increase the biogas
production of AD; for example, to enhance the hydrolysis rate of complex
substrates,9 alleviate ammonia toxicity,10,11 increase the organic loading rate,12 or
recover the AD process from ammonia inhibition.13

Furthermore, it is generally known that volatile
fatty acid (VFA)
accumulation under overloading conditions in AD is a common problem.
This accumulation would inhibit methanogenesis and even induce AD
process failure. Notably, bioaugmentation has successfully recovered
deteriorated digesters from organic overloading.14,15 However, a precondition for successful bioaugmentation is the availability
of specific microorganisms; for example, these might be purchased
or enriched through feeding with a selective medium. In particular,
the use of bioaugmentation to restore a failing digestion process
caused by VFA acidosis may require an acid-tolerant methanogenic culture
for several reasons. (1) VFA accumulation is often accompanied by
a decrease in pH. In addition, both high VFA concentrations and pH
drop exert a toxic and inhibitory effect on microbial activity, followed
by a complete system failure in anaerobic digesters. Thus, a candidate
that can survive under low pH conditions is important. (2) Compared
to other microorganisms involved in AD (e.g., acidogens and acetogens),
methanogens may be hardest to hit by dropping pH as they are highly
sensitive to environmental changes;16 therefore,
adding methanogens to increase their population might enhance methanogenesis.
(3) Finally, the introduced pure strain may be difficult to grow or
exhibit limit activity in the digesters owing to competition with
the indigenous microbes; hence, a mixed culture appears to constitute
a promising alternative for a competitive seed in bioaugmentation
compared to a pure strain.

Several pure acidophilic or acidotolerant
methanogens have previously
been isolated, of which all were hydrogenotrophic methanogens that
grew at a pH of 3.8–6.6.17,18 Alternatively, enrichment
of acidotolerant H2/CO2-utilizing methanogenic
cultures has also been described.19 Moreover,
some researchers found that acetotrophic methanogens were affected
by a low pH to a greater degree compared to hydrogenotrophic methanogens.20 Therefore, it appears necessary to introduce
both acetoclastic and hydrogen-dependent methanogens to the VFA-accumulated
digesters. To avoid separate enrichment of these two kinds of methanogens
using acetate or a H2/CO2-supplemented medium,
respectively, we proposed the use of propionate as a sole carbon source
because it can produce acetate, H2, and CO2 as
intermediate products during anaerobic conversion. This would lead
to the generation of a microbial culture containing propionate-oxidizing
bacteria in addition to methanogens, which may improve not only methanogenesis
but also the degradation of propionate.

In our previous study,
an acid-tolerant methanogenic culture was
enriched, which could produce methane from propionate as a carbon
source at a pH between 4.8 and 5.5.21 However,
researchers rarely explored how to obtain an acid-tolerant methanogenic
culture and why different acclimation methods result in a distinct
digestion performance. In the present study, we focused on the comparison
of different acclimation strategies and response of microbial communities
to various profiles of pH decline to clarify these questions. The
findings of this study are expected to benefit the recovery from overloaded
digestion or improve the treatment of acidic wastewater, along with
providing information for the enrichment of other special microbial
cultures.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Experimental
Setup
The inoculum was
taken from an anaerobic digester treating crops (Guangzhou Institute
of Energy Conversion, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). Prior to
use, it was sieved through a 1 mm mesh to remove grit and other solids.

The experiment was carried out in a mesophilic semicontinuous continuous
stirred-tank-type reactor with 1.0 L of working volume, which was
initially inoculated with the sieved digestate, after which the headspace
was flushed with a N2/CO2 gas mixture (80:20
v/v). An identical hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days was maintained
by removing 50 mL of reactor content and replacing it with 50 mL of
feed once daily under anaerobic conditions.

Sodium propionate
was chosen as the sole substrate. The organic
loading rate was set at 0.53 g of propionic acid L–1 d–1 during the whole experimental period. The
volume of the feed was made up by a nutrient medium. The nutrient
medium contained the following [mg L–1]: NH4Cl [400]; MgSO4·6H2O [250]; KCl
[400]; CaCl2·2H2O [120]; (NH4)2HPO4 [80]; and FeCl3·6H2O [55]; and the trace element salts (i.e., CoCl2·6H2O, NiCl2·6H2O, MnCl2·4H2O, CuCl2·2H2O, AlCl3·6H2O, ZnCl2, Na2WO4·2H2O, H3BO3, Na2SeO3, and Ma2MoO4·2H2O) [each at 0.5].22

2.2 Enrichment Strategy
The daily target
pH was set based on the following two considerations: (1) which is
the optimum initial pH for start-up and (2) how long the digester
should be running at each pH level during the gradually reducing pH
process. Therefore, we set the daily target initial pH of the four
digesters during each HRT, as shown in Table 1.

the Four Reactors

a R1–4,
reactors 1–4.

The
pH in the digester increased after 1 day’s AD. In order
to maintain the target pH, every day we measured the pH of the digestate
first and then we used HCl to adjust the digestate pH to the target
pH.

As shown in Table 1, the four digesters proceeded through a variety of different
pH
values until the target pH had decreased to 6.0 between day 160 and
day 280. The daily initial pH of reactor 1 (R1) was set at 6.5 during
the first eight HRTs, whereas the other three reactors were started
at pH 7.0. The pH values of both R2 and R3 were reduced by 0.5 in
each decline with a step length of 4 and 3 HRTs, respectively. R4
was started at pH 7.0, and the daily initial pH was directly decreased
to 6.0 after running for eight HRTs. To further establish the best-performing
acid-tolerant microbial community, the pH of the four digesters was
set even lower at 5.5 and then 5.0 in the last two HRTs.

2.3 Analytical Methods for Digestion Performance
pH was
determined using a FE28-Standard meter (Mettler-Toledo,
Zurich, Switzerland) with a glass electrode calibrated in buffers
at pH 7.0 and 4.0. VFAs were quantified using an e2698HPLC system
(Waters, Milford, CT) equipped with a column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
at 50 °C with 0.5 mM H2SO4 as the mobile
phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min–1. Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) contents were analyzed
using a GC-2014 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped
with a thermal conductivity detector (120 °C) and Porapak Q column
(70 °C); argon was used as the carrier gas (20 mL min–1).

2.4 16S rRNA Gene Amplification
DNA extraction
was performed using the fast DNA spin kit for soil (QBIOgene, Santa
Ana, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA
quality was assessed using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA
concentrations were determined using a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). The extracted DNA sample was then handled
according to the protocol of the genomic DNA sample preparation kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). First, DNA fragmentation was performed
using a Covaris S2 Ultrasonicator (Woburn, MA), and then the DNA fragments
were processed by end reparation, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and
DNA size selection. PCR and product purification were based on Illumina
MiSeq2x300 instructions. For Archaea, the 16S rRNA genes were amplified
through three rounds of PCR. The primers for the first round were
340F (5′-CCC TAY GGG GYG CAS CAG-3′) and 1000R (5′-GGC
CAT GCA CYW CYT CTC-3′). The PCR products were then used as
templates for a second PCR with primers 349F (5′-CCC TAC ACG
ACG CTC TTC CGA TCT N (barcode) GYG CAS CAG KCG MGA AW-3′)
and 806R (5′-GAC TGG AGT TCC TTG GCA CCC GAG AAT TCC AGG ACT
ACV SGG GTA TCT AAT-3′), followed by a third round of PCR with
Illumina nested primers. Bacteria 16S rRNA genes were amplified through
two rounds of PCR. The primers for the first round were 341F (5′-CCC
TAC ACG ACG CTC TTC CGA TCT G (barcode) CCT ACG GGN GGC WGC AG-3′)
and 805R (5′-GAC TGG AGT TCC TTG GCA CCC GAG AAT TCC AGA CTA
CHV GGG TAT CTA ATC C-3′), and the PCR products were then used
as templates for a second PCR with Illumina nested primers.22 Prior to sequencing, PCR products of different
samples were normalized in equimolar amounts in the final mixture,
which was used to construct the PCR amplicon libraries. Sequencing
was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. The obtained sequences
were phylogenetically allocated down to the phylum, class, and genus
level using the RDP classifier (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/misc/resources.jsp). The 16S rRNA gene amplification data were deposited in the NCBI
Sequence Read Archive database with accession numbers SRR6702441–6702452.
To define the relative abundance of a given phylogenetic group, the
number of sequences affiliated to that group was divided by the total
number of obtained sequences. The results were used for the analysis
and comparison of microbial community structure differences. QIIME
(http://qiime.org/) was used for
network analysis. Species with abundance >1% were used for network
analysis. The network layout was generated using the R language igraph
package (https://igraph.org/r/), with significant contact (weight > 100) nodes.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Digestion Performance
Figure 1 shows the
volumetric biogas
production (VBP) and methane percentage in the four bioreactors. We
found that biogas production varied according to the bioreactor. For
R1, the daily initial pH was continually adjusted to 6.5 during the
first eight retention times (day 0–160); correspondingly, VBP
fluctuated between 0.21 and 0.32 L L–1 d–1, and the average volatile solid methane production (VSMP) (methane
production per gram VS per day) was 0.28 L g–1 d–1. In addition, both biogas production and methane
content of R1 increased slightly after running for 100 days, which
may have occurred because of the degradation of the propionate concentration
(Figure 2). When the
daily initial pH declined to 5.0, R1 could still produce methane with
the average VSMP of 0.42 L g–1 d–1, which was approximately 73% of the theoretical methane production,
indicating that the digester was gradually adapted to the acidic environment
with a pH of 5.0. Both R2 and R3 were able to operate at the pH of
6.0; however, they were prone to failure when the pH was adjusted
to 5.5 and even stopped producing biogas upon the lower pH shock of
5.0 (Figure 1). R4
was directly exposed to a daily initial pH of 6.0 from 7.0 on day
161 without running at a pH of 6.5; as a result, biogas production
in the following two HRTs dropped markedly, suggesting that the microbial
community could not resist such a pH shock. Methane content during
the stable states in the four reactors did not significantly differ,
being between 50 and 68%.

Figure 2 Changes in VFA concentration and pH in R1, R2, R3, and
R4.

As shown in Figure 2, after daily fermentation, the pH of R1
rose by 0.5–0.8 compared
to the initial target pH. The time-course pH profiles in the other
three digesters followed the same trend when the daily initial pH
was above 6.0. However, once the daily initial pH was set at 5.5,
the increase of pH in R2 and R3 was smaller compared to that of R1.
During the last HRT, the pH in R2 and R3 rose only minimally at the
end of the operation once the pH was adjusted to 5.0. In addition,
the propionate concentration in both reactors increased sharply during
the later stage (Figure 2), which was responsible for a significant drop in methane production
(Figure 1). The performance
of R4 was even worse, with substantial propionate accumulation being
observed once the daily initial pH decreased from 7.0 to 6.0. After
running at a pH of 6.0 for 16 days, the propionate concentration in
R4 reached up to 6.9 g L–1, suggesting that propionate
degradation is closely associated with sudden pH decline. Similarly,
a previous study also found that a low pH (below 6.5) inhibited propionate
degradation in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor using propionate
as the sole carbon source.23

It is
obvious from Figures 1 and 2 that R1 showed the best performance,
followed by R2 and R3, whereas R4 performed worst. The different capability
of biogas production among the four reactors could be ascribed to
a variety of pH decline processes. R2 was operating in each pH phase
(7.0 and 6.5) for four HRTs, which was longer compared to the three
HRTs of R3. This may be the main factor contributing to the better
performance of R2 than R3. R4 was directly exposed to pH 6.0 without
running at 6.5. Apparently, decreasing pH by 1.0 led to poor methane
production at a pH of 6.0 in R4. R1 led the AD during the last HRT
with a pH of 5.0, indicating that operating for a longer time at pH
6.5 might be better for the tolerance of lower pH conditions. Moreover,
the pH of start-up phase might be an important factor.

3.2 Shift of the Methanogenic Community in Different
Digesters
Obvious differences in digestion performance among
the four digesters were observed until the daily initial pH was decreased
to 6.0. Therefore, the archaeal community was compared when the pH
was below 6.0. Specimens were taken from R1, R2, and R3 on day 280
(pH 6.0) and day 320 (pH 5.0). R4 failed when the pH was below 6.0,
so specimens of G4 were taken the day 160 (pH 7.0) and day 180 (pH
6.0). Based on the results of 16S rRNA gene amplification, we identified
11 archaeal genera that were capable of methane production, as shown
in Figure 3. The results
clearly illustrate that at pH 6.0, the abundance of Methanothrix, an acetoclastic methanogen, was much
higher in R1, with 60.53% (15,362 reads), compared with 13.44% (3231
reads) in R4. In contrast, the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanospirillum become the absolute majority methanogen
in R4 with a relative abundance of 84.31% (20,262 reads). This increase
in abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in stressed conditions
was also reported previously.18,24 For R4, with the shock
of pH 6.0, the relative abundance of Methanothrix decreased markedly from 39.10 to 13.44%. Therefore, the poor performance
in R4 might mainly derive from a significant reduction of Methanothrix.

Figure 3 Response of main archaeal genera associated
with methane generation
under acidic conditions (the size of each sphere indicates the read
number of the 16S rRNA gene; numbers 5, 6, and 7 following the hyphen
represent the pH value).

In addition, the structure
of the methanogenic community in R2
was similar to that of R1, but fewer Methanospirillum members were present at pH 5.0 in R2 than in R1. Compared to that
in R1 and R2, the abundance of Methanolinea (19.35%) in R3 was relatively lower at pH 5.0.

Based on the
response of the functional microbes in the four digesters
to low pH, it could be conjectured that a sudden shock of low pH had
a significant impact on acetoclastic methanogens. In contrast, hydrogenotrophic
methanogens exhibited high acid tolerance. Moreover, prolonging the
acclamation period and gradually decreasing the pH appears to be beneficial
for improving the adaptability of acetoclastic methanogens to acidic
conditions.

3.3 Microbial Network of Methanogenic
Culture
during the Acid Adaptation Process
As it yielded the best
methane production under acidic conditions, the culture from R1 was
selected from the four digesters for further bioaugmentation. Prior
to its application, it was essential to comprehensively understand
the microbial community structure and its dynamic change with pH;
therefore, a microbial network was constructed based on the samples
taken under various pH conditions (pH 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0), as
shown in Figure 4.
Overall, 732 genera were detected in all samples; Figure 4 only shows the main genera
with proportions >1%.

Figure 4 Microbial network during the acid-tolerant acclimation
process.
Each pie represents a genus; the size of the pie indicates the total
occurrence of this genus. The different color areas in the pie represent
the contribution of each sample to genus abundance.

In detail, the biggest pie represents genus Rhodobacter, indicating that it had a high occurrence
rate during the whole
acclimation period. Moreover, the color partition of Rhodobacter in the pie indicates that its abundance
was increasing along with a dropping pH, with a rise from 0.40% at
pH 6.5 (light blue) to 44.07% at pH 5.0 (yellow). In particular, some
species affiliated to genus Rhodobacter have been commonly reported as supporting photo fermentative hydrogen
production.25 These enable the production
of hydrogen from malate and glutamate,26,27 in addition
to various VFAs28 such as acetic acid and
lactate. If Rhodobacter produced hydrogen
in R1, the hydrogen may have been immediately scavenged by hydrogen-consuming
microbes, such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens, as no hydrogen was
detected in the biogas content.

The second biggest pie in Figure 4 represents Methanothrix, which is the dominant acetotrophic
methanogen in the reactor. Its
occurrence decreased with the dropping pH from the maximum read numbers
of 15,857 at pH 6.5 to 8944 at pH 5.0. The feasible pH range for acetotrophic
methanogens is reportedly between 6.6 and 7.3,29 and Methanothrix therefore
decreased once the pH was lower than 6.5 in R1.

In addition,
several functional members also occupied the center
positions in the network, such as Syntrophobacter, Syntrophomonas, Smithella, and Pelotomaculum. These were closely
correlated to the degradation of propionate. The proportion of Syntrophobacter rose from 1.03% in the inoculum to
8.83% on day 280. Even though the pH was lower at 5.5 and 5.0 during
the last two HRTs, Syntrophobacter still
maintained its abundance above 8.25%, leading to a relatively high
ability of propionate conversion in R1. The high occurrence of Syntrophobacter has been observed in previous studies.22 Although the pure strain of Syntrophobacter has rarely been reported to grow at pH 5.0, Syntrophobacter appeared to outnumber other propionate-oxidizing bacteria in R1,
reinforcing the importance of this genus to overall propionate degradation
under acidic conditions.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
an acid-tolerant methanogenic culture, producing
methane from propionate at pH 5.0, was obtained by a method of stepwise
pH reduction, dominated by acetoclastic Methanothrix and hydrogenotrophic Methanolinea. This culture might be considered as a candidate for bioaugmentation
of overloaded digestion recovery and acidic wastewater treatment.
Different acclimation strategies exhibited various microbial community
compositions: a sudden shock of low pH could enrich a hydrogenotrophic
methanogen-dominant culture, whereas prolonged and gradual decrease
of pH resulted in the enrichment of mixed acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic
methanogens. These results together indicate the feasibility of generating
a desired enrichment by designing appropriate acclimation processes.
