Cp*M-type half-sandwich
dichalcogenolate complexes bearing either
carborane or benzene moieties show diverse reactivity patterns toward
two selected 2,6-disubstituted aryl azides under thermal or photolytic
conditions. The chalcogen (S and Se) has little effect on the formation
of final products. However, the effects of both the metal center and
the ligand moiety of the metal precursor on the reactions were significant.
Compared to iridium precursor Cp*IrS2C2B10H10 (1a), rhodium and cobalt analogues
(1b: Cp*RhS2C2B10H10, 1c: Cp*CoS2C2B10H10) demonstrated no reactivity toward aryl azides. The
reaction of Cp*IrSe2C2B10H10 (1d) with 2,6-Me2C6H3N3 led to the clean formation of complex 2 with C(sp3)–H activation of one methyl group of
the Cp* ligand and loss of N2 along with the rearrangement
of the benzene ring of the original azide ligand, whereas the treatment
of Cp*IrS2C6H4 (1e)
with 2,6-Me2C6H3N3 under
the same reaction conditions gave a 16-electron half-sandwich complex 5 featuring C–N coupling on one methyl group from the
Cp* ligand. When 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3 was employed, the same reaction patterns for forming products
(3 and 6) with the nitro group migrating
to the para-position versus the original aryl azide were observed.
In addition, the reaction with metal precursor 1d generated
another product 4 featuring the exchange of nitro and
azido groups, while the reaction with 1e afforded another
complex 7 with the formation of the N–NO2 moiety. All new complexes were characterized by spectroscopy methods,
and single-crystal X-ray analyses were performed for complexes 2 and 5–7. Furthermore, radical mechanisms
for the formation of complexes 2–7 were proposed.

Introduction
Organic azides are
widely used in synthesis of heterocyclic compounds
via cycloaddition or insertion with organic unsaturated compounds.1 These species have been recognized as an efficient
and convenient nitrogen sources for various types of nitrogen-containing
molecules. Among their all possible applications, great emphasis has
been devoted to the transition-metal-catalyzed amination of C–H
bonds due to their ubiquity in almost all organic skeletons.2 During transition-metal-catalyzed amination,
the interaction between metal and organic azide is involved which
ultimately plays an important role in the catalysis. Thus, the reactivity
of organic azides with transition-metal complexes has attracted considerable
interests.3 Generally, organic azides reacting
with transition-metal complexes give metal imido derivatives.4 Meanwhile, metal–imide complexes,5 tetra-azabutadiene complexes,6 isocyanate derivatives,5a,7 and triazenide
complexes8 are already reported. But in
some cases, the reactions of organic azides with transition metal
complexes could lead to the formation of unprecedented products with
unique structures. For example, dinickel(II) and dicopper(II) diketimide
adducts could be obtained from the reaction of aryl azides ArN3 with their suitable precursors.9 And the reaction of the aryl azide 4-Ph-2,6-iPr2C6H3N3 (Ar4PhN3) with [iPr2NN]Cu(NCMe) afforded to the formation of the diazametallocyclobutene
complex [iPr2NN]Cu(κ2-N,N-NC(Me)Ar4Ph).9a

We have a long-standing interest
in the reactivity of 16-electron
half-sandwich complexes Cp#M (Cp# = Cp, Cp*;
M = Co, Rh, Ir) and (p-cymene)M (M = Ru, Os) bearing
an o-carborane-1,2-dichalcogenolate ligand with small
molecules, such as alkynes,10 diazo compounds,11 and organic azides.6a,11c,12 Notably, we reported that the thermal or
photochemical reactions of Cp*IrS2C2B10H10 (1a) with 2,6-disubstituted aryl azides
led to the C–C coupling and C–S bond formation via radical
mechanisms in previous report.12c It was
found that the orthosubstituted electron-withdrawing groups in aryl
azides are easy to migrate to afford C–S bond products, while
the electron-donating ones are inert to the migration and C–C
coupling adduct was isolated in the case of 2,6-Me2C6H3N3. Later, we demonstrated also that
the reaction of 1a with meta-substituted aryl azide afforded
products involving C–C and C–S bond formation via C–H
activation undergoing a radical mechanism.12d The unusual reactivity between this type of complexes and aryl azides
prompted us to investigate its regularity and generality. It is well
known that the carborane ligand is a typical three-dimension and electron-deficient
moiety, which always results in different reactivities compared to
other simple organic skeletons, such as a benzene moiety.13 Such difference is derived from not only the
steric effect but also the electronic effect. Thus, we anticipate
that the replacement of carborane with benzene in our studied metal
precursors may lead to different product formation. In addition, it
was reported that the changing of the metal center as well as the
chalcogen binding to the metal center showed some different reaction
behaviors towards alkynes.10a,10h,10j Herein, we present our efforts towards understanding the chemistry
between Cp*M type half-sandwich complexes varied with a metal center,
chalcogen as well as the ligand moiety and selected 2,6-disubstituted
aryl azides. With the exception of similar products as we previously
reported,12c two new types of products
featuring the C–N or N–N bond were obtained. The results
show that the reaction products are dependent not only upon the metal
center but also the type of aryl azides and the organic moiety of
the complexes.

Results and Discussion
In our previous
report, 2,6-Me2C6H3N3 and
2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3 demonstrated
totally different reactivity towards 1a, which led to
the formation of C–C coupling product I and C–S
coupling products II and III, respectively
(Scheme 1).12c Thus, we selected
these two 2,6-disubstituted aryl azides to investigate the effect
of the variation of the metal center, chalcogen, and organic skeleton
of the complexes. Initially, when rhodium was employed as a replacement
to the iridium center, the rhodium species 1b demonstrated
totally inert reactivity towards the selected aryl azides. For cobalt
precursor 1c, the reaction with the selected aryl azides
did not proceed under the same conditions. Further prolonging the
reaction time or increasing reaction temperature resulted in the partial
decomposition of complex 1c and trace products were difficult
to purify and identify.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Complexes I–III and Metal Effect
on the Reaction
Next, we chose selenium
analogue 1d to study the effect
of the chalcogen on the reactivity. It was found that products 2–4 analogous to complexes I–III could be isolated in low to moderate yields from the reaction of 1d with 2,6-Me2C6H3N3 and 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3, respectively (Scheme 2). The only difference observed was that complex 1d appeared to be slightly more reactive than the sulfur analogue 1a because its thermal reaction with 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3 could be finished within
90 min at 80 °C. This observation was in good agreement with
the results concluded in the case of the reaction of 1a and 1d with alkynes.10h Complexes 2–4 were fully characterized by various spectroscopy
techniques and elemental analyses. The 1H NMR spectrum
of complex 2 gave rise to a typical broad singlet at
10.38 ppm attributable to the NH group, which was 0.2 ppm downfield
shifted compared to that in complex I. In addition, resonances
associated with the newly generated CH2 protons were observed
at δ = 2.45 and 2.29 ppm with J = 15 Hz, and
four sets of singlets in the ratio of the 3:3:3:3 intensity in the
range of 1.50–1.90 ppm corresponding to the methyl groups in
the original Cp* ring. The 13C NMR spectrum showed, in
addition to a methylene carbon signal at 17.5 ppm and a signal at
52.4 ppm for a quaternary carbon, a signal at 175.9 ppm attributable
to the C=N unit. The solid-state structure of complex 2 was further confirmed by single crystal X-ray analyses.
As shown in Figure 1, the Ir atom is η5-bound to the functionalized
Cp* ligand, σ-bound to an imino group from the side arm of the
functionalized Cp* ligand and an o-carborane-1,2-dichalcogenolate
ligand in a three-legged piano stool geometry with angles of 90.57(2)°
(Se1–Ir1–Se2), 89.30(13)° (N1–Ir1–Se1)
and 84.19(13)° (N1–Ir1–Se2). The Ir1–N1,
Ir1–Se1, and Ir1–Se2 bond distances were found to be
2.050(5), 2.4639(7), and 2.4764(7) Å, respectively, which are
comparable to those in similar metal carborane analogues.10a,12c,12d The N1–C18 (1.286(7)
Å) length is about 0.02 Å shorter than that in the sulfur
analogue,12c indicative of a double bond.
Similar to those observed in sulfur analogues,12c,12d the broad singlets at 4.66 and 7.73 ppm in the 1H NMR
spectra of complexes 3 and 4 are assigned
to the characteristic −NH signals. More than the 3 ppm downfield
shift of −NH resonance in complex 4 is probably
due to the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between −NH
and −NO2 in the solution. In addition, two phenyl
proton resonances, which displayed two singlets in 3 and
two doublets in 4, are supportive of cyclometalation
in these complexes.

113.9(7).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Complexes 2–4
Finally, we employed Cp*Ir(bdt)
(1e, bdt = benzene-1,2-dithiolate),
based on benzene-1,2-dithiolato, a more readily available, easy to
functionalize, and inexpensive ligand than carborane, to investigate
its reactivity towards 2,6-Me2C6H3N3 and 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3 (Scheme 3). Interestingly, a rather different reactivity was observed in the
reaction of complex 1e with excess 2,6-Me2C6H3N3, which resulted in the formation
of new complex 5 in moderate yield. Complex 5 was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray
crystallography, which confirmed that 5 is an amine-substituted
Cp* complex as shown in Scheme 3. Therefore, C(sp3)–H bond amination of
the Cp* ligand occurs, which is different from the reaction between
carborane adducts 1a, 1d, and 2,6-Me2C6H3N3, where the C–C
coupling between one of the methyl group of Cp* and the benzene ring
was observed. Complex 5 is a rare example featuring the
activation of the C–H bond of the Cp* ligand and the formation
of the C–N bond. A similar example was isolated in the reaction
of 1a with benzoyl azide in our previous report.12a The 1H NMR spectrum of 5 revealed the presence of three sets of the singlet in a 6:6:6 intensity
ratio at δ = 2.25, 2.20, and 2.15 ppm, respectively, corresponding
to four methyl groups in the original Cp* ring and two methyl groups
of initial aryl azides, along with a characteristic −NH peak
at δ = 2.38 ppm. In addition, resonance associated with −CH2 protons was observed at δ = 3.81 ppm, whose corresponding 13C NMR signal appeared at δ = 42.5 ppm. Compound 5 crystallized in the triclinic crystal system with the P1̅ space group. The solid-state structure of 5 accompanied with selected bond parameters are shown in Figure 1. The structure revealed
that the one methyl group of the Cp* ligand is bound to the nitrogen
atom of the original aryl azide after the loss of N2 to
generate a new C–N bond.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Complexes 5–7
In contrast to the reactions
of the iridium precursor-bearing carborane
moiety (1a and 1d) with 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3, the interaction of 1e with 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3 led to the generation of an analogous product 6 and a new species 7. The 1H NMR data of 6 was consistent with the generation of a secondary amine
group and the migration of a nitro group from the orthoposition to
the paraposition versus the original aryl azide, evidenced by the
appearance of a broad singlet at δ = 4.59 ppm and two singlets
at δ = 8.26 and 7.55 ppm. However, no −NH signal could
be observed in complex 7. In addition, the resonances
of three aryl protons from the original aryl azide in complex 7 indicated that its molecular structure is different from
complexes III and 4. To confirm the spectroscopy
assignments and to determine the solid-state structure of complexes 6 and 7, we undertook X-ray crystal-structure
analysis. Their molecular structures are shown in Figure 2. Both the complexes containing
two five-membered metallacyclic motifs (Ir–N–C–C–S
and Ir–S–C–C–S) and sharing one Ir–S
bond as seen here are similar to those observed in their carborane
analogues.12b−12d The only difference between them is the
position of the nitro group, which is located at the paraposition
versus the original aryl azide in complex 6 and bind
directly to the nitrogen atom from the original aryl azide after the
loss of N2 in complex 7. This resulted in
some deviation of bond and angle parameters with the Ir1–N1
bond in complex 6 (2.061(8) Å) being significantly
shorter than that in complex 7 (2.114(3) Å), and
consequently the C17–N1–Ir1 angle (122.2(8)°) being
larger than the corresponding C17–N1–Ir1 angle (117.5(2)°).
Additionally, different from a double bond of N1–C17 (1.306(14)
Å) in complex 6, its bond distance (1.416(4) Å)
is more than 0.1 Å longer than in complex 7, featuring
a typical single bond. It is possible that the strong electron-withdrawing
nature of the nitro group is responsible for such a difference. Surprisingly,
any attempt to obtain the analogous adducts of complexes III and 4 from the reaction was unsuccessful. This implies
that the difference in steric hindrance between the carborane and
benzene moiety plays an important role in product formation,13b evidenced by the production of C–N coupling
adducts III and 4 with the bulky carborane
ligand and N–N coupling complex 7 with the small
benzene ligand.

To investigate the possible mechanism
for the product formation,
photochemical reactions of 1d, 1e with the
two selected aryl azides were performed. Similar to the results we
previously reported,12c,12d the photolytic reactions could
proceed with lower yields of expected compounds than that were isolated
under thermal conditions. This fact indicated that the formation of
these complexes may underwent a radical mechanism. The speculation
was further supported by the EPR experiments, in which complicated
radical signals were observed in the in situ photolytic reaction of 1e, 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3 and the radical capture reagent, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (Figure S1). On the basis
of these results and literature reports,12b−12d,14 the proposed reaction pathways
for the formation of 2–7 are shown in Scheme 4. Initial coordination
of the azide to the metal, followed by dinitrogen extrusion leads
to the formation of the reactive iridium imido intermediate, which
can transform into a bicyclic azepine intermediate and then further
rearrange to several diradical adducts in five path routes (path A
to path E) via the 1,2-shift of the nitro group, resonance and hydrogen
abstraction according to the substituted group on aryl azides and
the ligand moiety of metal precursors. When 2,6-Me2C6H3N3 was employed, hydrogen abstraction
from a methyl group of the Cp* ligand occurred to generate a C–C
diradical and a C–N diradical according to the carborane and
benzene moiety of iridium precursors, which then formed complexes 2 and 5 via a intramolecular radical coupling,
respectively. When 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3 was selected, the nitro group could migrate to three
orthopositions via the 1,2-shift via the paths from C to E to afford
different diradical species. Similar to the analogous product in our
previous report,12b−12d intramolecular radical coupling after further
transformation of diradical species led to the formation of complexes 3 and 6, 4, and 7,
respectively.

Scheme 4 Proposed Reaction Pathways for the Formation of 2–7
Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the reactivity
of Cp*M-type (M = Co,
Rh, Ir) 16-electron half-sandwich complexes 1a–1e towards two selected 2,6-disubstituted aryl azides, leading to the
isolation of five types of radical coupling products. The nature of
the metal center plays a key role in the reactivity and only iridium
precursors could undergo the reaction under thermal or photolytic
conditions. The chalcogen, either S or Se, does not essentially affect
the formation of the final products, whereas the ligand moiety of
the metal precursor makes difference. In the case of 2,6-Me2C6H3N3, the metal precursor bearing
carborane moiety resulted in the formation of C–C coupling
complex 2 while the metal precursor with the benzene
moiety afforded the generation of C–N coupling complex 5, both of which featured C(sp3)–H activation
of one methyl group of the original Cp* ligand. When 2-Me-6-NO2C6H3N3 was employed, the
products, which are complexes 3 and 6, 4, and 7, respectively, formed from nitro migration
via the 1,2-shift in three pathways and further rearrangements were
isolated. Notably, a N–NO2 moiety presenting in
complex 7 is rare. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first example wherein the N–NO2 moiety is
formed via the 1,2-shift of the nitro group during the reaction, though
the N–NO2 moiety always appears in energetic complexes.15 Compared to the steric hindrance of the bulky
carborane ligand, the small steric hindrance of the benzene moiety
in the metal precursor may be responsible for the formation of the
complex 7 bearing N–NO2 moiety. The
diverse reactivity and the modes of product formation shown in this
paper support ongoing efforts to develop new metal-mediated stoichiometric
and catalytic transformations that are relevant to the goal of small-molecule
activation.

Experimental Section
Compounds were prepared and handled
by standard Schlenk techniques.
Toluene was predried over molecular sieves and distilled over CaH2 under nitrogen prior to use. Metal precursors 1a–1d,161e,17 and aryl azides18 were prepared
by literature procedures. The NMR measurements were performed on a
Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer. Chemical shifts were given with respect
to CHCl3/CDCl3 (δ 1H = 7.24
ppm; δ 13C = 77.0 ppm) and external Et2O·BF3 (δ 11B = 0 ppm). The C, H,
and N microanalyses were carried out with an Elementar Vario EL III
elemental analyzer. Mass data were determined with a LCQ (ESI–MS,
Thermo Finnigan) mass spectrometer. Photolysis experiments were conducted
in an XPA-photochemical reactor (Xujiang Electromechanical Plant,
Nanjing, China) equipped with a 500 W high-pressure mercury lamp (wavelength
365 nm) at 25 °C. EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature
on a Bruker EMX-10/12 spectrometer operating at 9.7 GHz and a cavity
equipped with a Bruker AquaX liquid sample cell. Crystallographic
data of complexes were collected on a Bruker SMART Apex II CCD diffractometer
with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å). The crystal structures were solved using direct methods in
the SHELXS program and refined by full-matrix least-squares routines,
based on F2, using the SHELXL package.19

and selected aryl azide (1.0
mmol) was heated at 80 °C or in refluxing toluene for 2–48
h. After the removal of the solvent, the crude product was purified
by chromatography using silica gel to give the target compound and
their characterization data are listed as follows.
