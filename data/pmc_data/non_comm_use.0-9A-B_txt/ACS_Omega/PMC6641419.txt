Amorphous CuxO nanoflakes with a thickness
of 10–50 nm were synthesized through dye-assisted transformation
of rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals using a facile
solution process. The morphology evolution observed by electron microscopy
is highly dependent on the reaction between the surface and the dye.
The crystal grain shrinks during the process until the formation of
a purely amorphous nanoflake. The amorphous CuxO nanoflake consists of a combination of Cu(I) and Cu(II)
with a ratio close to 1:1. It shows enhanced photocatalytic reactivity
toward the degradation of methyl orange compared to that of rhombic
dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals with all active (110):Cu
facets. The chemical composition and architecture remain the same
after repeating degradation tests. The high surface-to-volume ratio
contributes to its superior photocatalytic performance, whereas its
low surface energy, confirmed by density functional theory simulations,
explains its improved stability. The nanoflakes also show the ability
of degrading nitrobenzene effectively, thus demonstrating great promise
as a highly stable and active photocatalyst for environmental applications.

Introduction
Cupric
oxide (CuO) and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) have raised
significant research interests recently because of their promising
applications in hydrogen production,1,2 carbon dioxide
reduction,3 solar energy conversion,4 water purification,5 and other photocatalytic applications.6−11 Indeed, Cu2O photocatalysts for wastewater purification
have demonstrated high efficiency, low toxicity, and environmental
acceptability.12 They are typically p-type
semiconductors with a narrow band gap, and their structure- and facet-dependent
properties have been studied in detail.13 The major drawback of Cu2O photocatalysts lies in the
poor stability under irradiation,14 limiting
their long-term photocatalytic applications. Many studies have been
carried out to improve the photocatalytic activity and stability of
Cu2O photocatalysts by introducing a cocatalyst to form
a composite photocatalyst.5,10,15−18 Apart from photocorrosion, Cu2O photocatalysts are also
reported to suffer from reconstruction during the photocatalytic reaction.12,19 Compared with Cu2O photocatalysts, CuO shows good stability
but much lower photocatalytic reactivity. This is due to its small
band gap and the easy recombination of electron–hole pairs,
thus limiting its ability of initiating photocatalytic reactions.
The preparation of copper oxide-based photocatalysts with high reactivity
and stability remains challenging. To achieve better photocatalytic
performance, nanostructures with high surface-to-volume ratios are
highly desired. Numerous works on copper oxide nano- or microparticles
of various structural topologies have been reported.20−24 Hollow cages and other topologies with a larger specific surface
area have also been synthesized.25−27 The synthesis of one-dimensional
(e.g., nanowire) or two-dimensional (e.g., nanoflake) architectures
with even higher surface-to-volume ratios has hitherto remained a
challenge. CuxO or CuOx is a hybrid of Cu(I) and Cu(II). Indeed, Cu4O3 (paramelaconite) is the most typical CuxO material with 50% Cu(I) and 50% Cu(II).28 CuxO is difficult
to synthesize from the standpoint of stabilizing both Cu(I) and Cu(II)
at the same time.29

In this work,
we take advantage of dye-assisted transformation
of Cu2O nanocrystals to form amorphous CuxO nanoflakes for the first time. The preparation was carried
out using a facile solution process. We study in detail the evolution
process and the underlying mechanism along with an analysis of the
atomic structure and surface energy using density functional theory
(DFT) simulations. The as-obtained amorphous CuxO nanoflakes show enhanced photocatalytic reactivity toward
the degradation of methyl orange under irradiation by visible-light
light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The amorphous CuxO nanoflakes demonstrate good stability after numerous degradation
test cycles without much change in either morphology or chemical composition
and even seem to very effectively degrade nitrobenzene. The results
suggest that CuxO with amorphous nanoflake
topology is very promising as a high-efficiency and stable photocatalyst
for wastewater purification.

Results and Discussion
Evolution of Morphology
and Crystallization
The evolution
of morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
as shown in Figure 1. Cu2O nanocrystals with a rhombic dodecahedral nanostructure
(Figure 1a) were dispersed
in deionized water and stirred constantly under irradiation with LED
as a light source for 4 h. The spectra of the LED light source are
shown in Figure S1, and its electrical
power is measured to be 8.880 W. No UV component (wavelength <
400 nm) is detected, and the peak is located at 455 nm. After 4 h
of irradiation, some nanosheets grew on the surface, as presented
in Figure 1b. A flowerlike
intermediate structure, as shown in Figure 1c, could be observed after methyl orange
was introduced to the solution. The morphology finally transformed
to nanoflake (Figure 1d) after 4 h of irradiation in methyl orange solution. The length
of nanoflakes ranged from 100 nm to a few micrometers with thickness
between 10 and 50 nm, as measured with SEM. The irradiation by the
LED light source is critical for this evolution. Quite a few nanoflakes
were formed without 4 h of irradiation in deionized water, as shown
in Figure S2a. The yield of nanoflakes
is comparably low without 4 h of irradiation in methyl orange solution,
as presented in Figure S2b, indicating
that irradiation at this stage accelerates the evolution process.
Cubic and octahedral Cu2O nanocrystals were tested under
the same conditions, and the flake yield followed the sequence of
cube < octahedron < rhombic dodecahedron, as demonstrated in Figure S3. This is consistent with the associated
photocatalytic reactivity reported in our previous work.31 Congo red, methylene blue, and rhodamine B were
used as a replacement of methyl orange, and the flake yield observed
by SEM is presented in Figure S4. Quite
a few nanoflakes were formed using methylene blue and rhodamine B.
Although flakes were observed with Congo red, the yield is much lower
compared to that using methyl orange. These observations show that
the photocatalytic interaction between the dye and the Cu2O photocatalyst is critical for the formation of nanoflakes. Rhombic
dodecahedron Cu2O nanocrystals, which show the highest
photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of methyl orange, generate
the most nanoflakes, whereas cubic Cu2O nanocrystals generate
the least. The high density of terminal copper atoms makes the Cu2O(110) facet positively charged, as demonstrated in Figure S5. The Cu2O(110) facet electrostatically
repels the positively charged methylene blue and rhodamine B molecules,
whereas the negatively charged methyl orange and Congo red molecules
are adsorbed to the surface easily.

after 4 h of immersion in methyl orange solution under irradiation.

The evolution of crystallization
was studied using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), as presented in Figure 2. The flowerlike intermediate structure in Figure 2a and its corresponding
selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Figure 2d indicate that it remains
crystalline in structure. The magnified TEM image of the tip of the
flowerlike structure is demonstrated in Figure 2b. The tip consists of two components, including
small grains in dark gray and flat areas in light gray. The magnified
TEM image of the flowerlike structure and its energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy are shown in Figure S6. The
flowerlike structure contains 64.27% Cu and 35.73% O. The SAED pattern
of grains, as shown in Figure 2e, denotes their crystal structure, whereas the SAED pattern
of the flat area in Figure 2f shows an amorphous phase. The uniform nanoflake in Figure 2c has the same SAED
pattern (Figure 2f)
as that of the flat area in Figure 2b, confirming that it is completely amorphous. It can
be concluded that the transformation from crystal to amorphous begins
from the tips and the size of the crystal grains reduces continuously
until the entire structure becomes an amorphous nanoflake.

Characterization of Nanomaterials
The phase of products
was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, as shown in Figure 3a. The same amount
of products was used. Rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals
show a typical Cu2O pattern, whereas the peaks decline
dramatically as the transformation process continues, indicating a
weaker crystallization phase and the formation of the amorphous structure.
The XRD pattern of the nanoflakes is almost a flat line, although
the presence of weak peaks shows a small fraction of untransformed
nanocrystals. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the rhombic
dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystal and amorphous nanoflake are
presented in Figure 3b. The rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystal has an absorption
peak at 455 nm, and the characteristic light-scattering feature from
500 to 1100 nm is due to the large particle size. Nanoflakes show
strong absorption from 380 to 500 nm, and no light scattering is observed.
The chemical composition was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements. The XPS patterns of various products are shown
in Figure 3c, and the
baseline has been subtracted. The XPS pattern of the rhombic dodecahedral
Cu2O nanocrystal shows peaks of only Cu 2p1/2 (952.28 eV) and Cu 2p3/2 (932.38 eV), implying a +1 chemical
valence of Cu in the product. After 4 h of irradiation in deionized
water, the main peak becomes wider and the shakeup peak appears, indicating
the existence of +2 chemical valence of Cu. The main peak contains
contributions from both Cu(I) and Cu(II), whereas the shakeup peak
entirely comes from Cu(II). The Cu(I) and Cu(II) ratios can be calculated
according to the following equations32 1   2  where A is the total area
of the main peak and B is the area of the shakeup
peak. A1/B is the ratio
of the direct photoemission (A1) and the
shakeup photoemission (B) of Cu(II). It was found
to be 1.59 ± 0.1 in this work. After 4 h of irradiation in deionized
water, the Cu(I) and Cu(II) ratios reach 61.4 and 38.6%, respectively.
The Cu(II) ratio of the nanoflake increases to 52.4%, indicating that
both Cu(I) and Cu(II) exist in the products. The increase of the Cu(II)
ratio implies that some Cu(I) atoms are oxidized to Cu(II) during
the photocatalytic reaction between methyl orange and the postirradiation
rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystal. The Raman spectra
are demonstrated in Figure 3d. The spectra of rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals
agree well with those in the literature.33,34 After 4 h of irradiation, the Raman spectra do not change significantly,
indicating that the majority composition is still Cu2O.
The Raman spectra of CuxO nanoflakes formed
after 4 h of irradiation in methyl orange solution are completely
different from those of Cu2O, CuO, or Cu4O3,35 confirming the complete transformation
of rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals and the new phase
of amorphous CuxO nanoflakes.

patterns, and (d) Raman spectra of the as-obtained samples.

Photocatalysis Performance
Figure 4a compares
the degradation of methyl orange
using the rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystal and amorphous
CuxO nanoflake photocatalysts. The degradation
reaches 74.1% after 30 min of constant stirring without irradiation
using the amorphous CuxO nanoflake. This
is due to the strong chemical adsorption between the surface and the
sulfonate group (SO3–) of methyl orange.19 The removal of methyl orange reaches 93.2% after
30 min of photocatalytic reaction, and no methyl orange is detected
after 2 h of photocatalytic degradation. The photocatalytic reaction
obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the first-order rate constant, Kapp, can be calculated using the following equation 3  where C/C0 is the degradation
of methyl orange and t is the degradation time. Thus, Kapp values
for amorphous CuxO nanoflakes and rhombic
dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals are calculated to be 2.72
and 1.67 h–1, respectively. The surface area is
studied on the basis of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
theory, and respective plots are depicted in Figure S7. The BET surface area of the amorphous CuxO nanoflake is measured to be 36.3987 m2/g, whereas
that of the rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystal is only
4.7804 m2/g. The high surface-to-volume ratio of amorphous
CuxO nanoflakes also contributes to its
high photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic performance of amorphous
CuxO nanoflakes is compared to that reported
in other studies, as listed in Table S1. The photocatalytic stability is tested by cycling degradation of
methyl orange, as demonstrated in Figure 4b. The degradation rate remains almost the
same after five repeated degradation cycles, indicating good stability
of the amorphous CuxO nanoflake. Cu2O photocatalysts are known to suffer from photocorrosion.36 Cu(I) is oxidized to Cu(II) during photocatalysis,
and the photocatalytic activity declines, thus limiting the lifetime
of the Cu2O photocatalyst. The SEM image of the amorphous
CuxO nanoflake after repeating tests is
presented in Figure S8. The nanoflake keeps
its original structure after cycling degradation tests. The XRD and
XPS patterns of amorphous CuxO nanoflakes
are shown in Figure 3a,c. The XRD pattern remains unchanged, whereas the Cu(II) ratio
increases only slightly to 54.4%, confirming the high stability of
the amorphous CuxO nanoflake. Nitrobenzene,
which is a stable and toxic organic compound in industrial wastewater,
is also used to test the photocatalytic reactivity of the amorphous
CuxO nanoflake. After 24 h of continuous
photocatalytic reaction, 93.5% of the nitrobenzene is degraded, as
shown in Figure 4c.
No organics are detected in the end, as confirmed by the total ion
chromatogram plots and mass spectrum, as shown in Figure S9, indicating that the final products are carbon dioxide
and water.

Atomic Structure and Surface
Energy
The atomic structure
and surface of amorphous CuxO are shown
in Figure 5. Different
from the structure of crystal CuO or Cu2O, most of the
Cu atoms of amorphous CuxO are 3-fold,
whereas a small portion is 2- or 4-fold. On the other hand, most O
atoms are 4-fold. The amorphous CuxO surface
structure is cleaved from the amorphous CuxO structure and then fully relaxed. The surface contains Cu and O
atoms; thus, both O and Cu dangling bonds appear on this surface.
Our previous paper31 showed that O-terminated
surfaces tend to be energetically stable, whereas the Cu-terminated
surfaces tend to be more photocatalytically active. The amorphous
CuxO nanoflake, transformed from the rhombic
dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystal with all (110):Cu facets,
is known to be highly photocatalytically active. The surface energy
of the amorphous CuxO surface is calculated
and compared to that of the Cu2O(110) surfaces, as shown
in Table 1. The amorphous
CuxO surface has a much smaller surface
energy than that of the Cu2O(110) stoichiometric and Cu-terminated
surfaces and hence has much better stability. In addition, the exposed
Cu atoms with dangling bonds on the amorphous CuxO surface play an important role in photocatalytic reactions,
leading to high reactivity. As a result, the amorphous CuxO nanoflake shows good stability and high photocatalytic
reactivity at the same time.

CuxO.

Conclusions
Amorphous CuxO nanoflakes have been
synthesized by transforming rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals,
taking advantage of dye-assisted transformation. The morphology evolution
has several stages, including the original rhombic dodecahedral nanocrystal,
rhombic dodecahedral structure with nanosheets on the surface, flowerlike
intermediate structure, and finally nanoflakes. The size of the crystal
grains reduces gradually during the transformation until the formation
of the purely amorphous nanoflakes. The categories of dyes and the
photocatalytic activity of the original nanocrystals have a great
effect on the evolution process. Rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals generate the most CuxO
nanoflakes compared with other morphologies. The amorphous CuxO shows an absorption peak at around 455 nm,
and the XRD measurements confirm the nature of the amorphous structure.
The ratio of Cu(I) and Cu(II) calculated by XPS measurements is close
to 1:1. The as-obtained amorphous CuxO
nanoflakes show higher photocatalytic reactivity toward the degradation
of methyl orange compared to that of rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O nanocrystals with all active (110):Cu facets. The nanoflakes having
a much lower surface energy demonstrate good structural stability
and chemical composition with the exposed Cu atoms with dangling bonds
despite repeated degradation tests. They are also effective in degrading
nitrobenzene. The results presented here demonstrate a new copper
oxide nanomaterial structure and a new facile way of preparing a highly
active and stable photocatalyst for environmental applications.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
The chemicals used, that is, copper(II) chloride
(97%), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (99%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
(98.5%), methyl orange (100%), methylene blue (82%), Congo red (85%),
and rhodamine B (95%), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium hydroxide
(98%) was purchased from Fisher brand. All chemicals were used as
received without further purification.

Synthesis of Cu2O Nanocrystals
Cu2O nanocrystals were synthesized
using a simple solution process as
reported in our previous work.30 Sixty-seven
milligrams of CuCl2 and 1 g of SDS were dispersed in 65
mL of deionized water. The solution was placed in a water bath at
35 °C with vigorous stirring for 10 min. Ten milliliters of 0.2
M NaOH was introduced. Cubic, octahedral, and rhombic dodecahedral
nanostructures were obtained by introducing 25 mL of 0.17, 0.4, and
1.0 M NH2OH·HCl, respectively. The solution was stirred
for 30 s and kept in the water bath for 1 h. The products were centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 4 min, and the precipitate was washed and centrifuged
twice using 50 mL of water and ethanol. The obtained products were
dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h.

Synthesis of Amorphous
CuxO Nanoflakes
One portion of
the as-prepared Cu2O nanocrystal was
dispersed in 250 mL of deionized water. The solution was constantly
stirred under irradiation with a visible LED light source for 4 h.
Ten milligrams of methyl orange was then introduced, and the solution
was stirred for another 4 h under irradiation. The products were centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 4 min, and the precipitate was washed and centrifuged
twice using 50 mL of water and ethanol. The resulting products were
dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h.

Nanomaterial Characterization
The morphologies of the
synthesized nanomaterial were studied using LEO Gemini 1530VP scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) at 8 kV and FEI Tecnai G2 20 transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) at 200 kV. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption spectra were recorded using a UniCam UV–vis spectrometer
v.2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker
D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a PHI5000VersaProbe
II scanning XPS microscope. Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw
inVia Raman microscope with the range from 100 to 800 cm–1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was
measured by Micromeritics Gemini VII.

Photocatalysis Experiments
White-light LEDs were used
as the light source. The spectra of the light source were recorded
using a Labsphere CDS-600 spectrometer. The photocatalysis experiment
on the degradation of methyl orange was carried out in a homemade
quartz immersion reactor with a volume of 300 mL at room temperature.
Thirty milligrams of pristine Cu2O nanocrystals or amorphous
CuxO nanoflakes were dispersed in 250
mL of the 20 mg/L methyl orange solution. The solution was constantly
stirred in the dark for 15 min to reach an adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. Every 30 min, 1.5 mL of the solution was sampled and
centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 4 min to separate the photocatalysts from
the solution. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the samples
were recorded, and the concentration of methyl orange was determined
by the absorption at 464 nm using UniCam UV–vis spectrometer
v.2. For the degradation of nitrobenzene solution, one portion of
amorphous CuxO nanoflake photocatalysts
(30 mg) was dispersed in 250 mL of the 30 mg/L nitrobenzene solution.
The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a 300 mL reactor under
LED illumination and with vigorous magnetic stirring. The categories
and concentrations of the organic compounds were studied using a Thermo
Scientific DSQ II GC/MS system.

DFT Calculation
The calculations were carried out with
plane-wave DFT code CASTEP using ultrasoft pseudopotentials and a
plane-wave cutoff of 400 eV. This converged the energies to under
0.01 eV per atom. We generated a 112-atom (64 Cu and 48 O) random
network supercell of CuxO by DFT molecular
dynamics (MD). A heating MD process at 3000 K was applied first for
10 ps. Then, the network was slowly cooled down to 300 K at a quenching
rate of 1 ps/100 K. Finally, geometry relaxation, including lattice
parameter relaxation, was applied to the amorphous network to obtain
the atomic structure. Our amorphous model gave a density of 5.61 g/cm3.
