Thermal
treatment during catalyst preparation is one of the important
factors affecting the characteristics and performance of a catalyst.
To improve the catalytic performance of an alumina-supported copper
catalyst prepared by an impregnation method for dimethyl ether (DME)
synthesis from CO2, the effects of the use of hot air and
infrared drying as well as calcination at 600 and 900 °C to prepare
alumina supports were investigated. Infrared drying could shorten
the required drying time by 75% when compared with hot air drying.
Infrared drying could also help maintain the pore size and pore volume
of the supports, leading to their larger surface areas. Different
drying techniques were additionally noted to result in different sizes
and shapes of the pores as well as to different copper distributions
and intensities of acid sites of the catalyst. An increase in the
calcination temperature resulted in a decrease in the surface area
of the supports because of particle aggregation. The drying technique
exhibited a more significant effect than calcination temperature on
the space-time yield of DME. A catalyst utilizing the support prepared
by infrared drying and then calcined at 600 °C exhibited the
highest yield of DME (40.9 gDME kgcat–1 h–1) at a reaction temperature of 300 °C.
Stability of the optimal catalyst, when monitored over a 24 h period,
was noted to be excellent.

==== Body
1 Introduction
During
the past decade, climate change and, in particular, global
warming have been of increasing concern.1−3 Such changes are primarily
because of the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the
atmosphere; the emission is partly because of combustion of fossil
fuels to generate electricity, which is in increasing demand globally.4 One feasible and sustainable strategy to reduce
CO2 emission is to convert the gas into valuable products
that can be used as fuels and chemical feedstocks, including methanol
and dimethyl ether (DME).5

DME is
considered an environmentally friendly fuel compound as
it does not produce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and coke upon combustion. DME also possesses a significantly higher
cetane number (ca. 55–60) than diesel.6 In addition to being a greener fuel compound, DME also exhibits
many other chemical application potentials, including being an intermediate
for the production of methyl acetate and dimethyl sulfate as well
as being a replacement compound for chlorofluorocarbons, among others.
Synthesis of DME from CO2 has therefore received much research
attention as doing so would not only reduce CO2 emission
into the atmosphere but also allow conversion of CO2 into
useful chemicals.

CO2 conversion into DME using a
heterogeneous catalyst
can be conducted via two sequential processes. Hydrogenation reaction
is the first process to synthesize methanol from CO2 (eq 1); reverse water gas shift
reaction can nevertheless simultaneously occur (eq 2). The second process is the dehydration reaction
to synthesize DME from methanol (eq 3). 1   2   3  

Alumina is widely used as a catalyst support for DME synthesis
reaction as alumina possesses higher surface area, thermal and mechanical
stabilities, and surface acidity.7 Moreover,
pore sizes of an alumina support can be manipulated over a wider range,
from meso to macro scales. The most popular catalyst for the synthesis
of DME from CO2 is alumina-supported copper (Cu/Al2O3) catalysts, which can provide DME yields in
the range of 20–40 gDME kgcat–1 h–1.8 Such a catalyst
is considered a bi-functional catalyst as it allows both methanol
synthesis and formation of DME in a single reactor. During the course
of the reaction, CO2 is initially converted into methanol
via hydrogenation over the Cu surface. Methanol is then immediately
transformed to DME via dehydration over acid sites of the alumina
surface.9

During catalyst preparation,
drying and calcination are known to
be the important steps that strongly affect the textural properties
of a catalyst (in such terms as surface area, pore size, and pore
volume); distribution of the active metal on a support10,11 and interaction between active sites and a support are also known
to be affected by these two preparation steps.12 While hot air drying has traditionally been used for catalyst
preparation, alternative drying techniques such as freeze drying and
microwave drying have also been studied.10,13−16 Different drying techniques and conditions have noted to differently
affect the pore size, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area, dispersion of metal on a support, and hence the performance
of a catalyst.17,18 Albretsen et al.,19 for example, reported that an iron-based catalyst
dried at 130 °C had larger pore volume, surface area, extent
of reduction, and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis rate but lower
methane selectivity compared to identical catalysts dried at higher
or lower temperatures. Villegas et al.20 found that metal dispersions, especially in the case of Ni, were
strongly influenced by the applied drying method; Ni dispersion was
more homogenous upon microwave drying or ambient-temperature drying
than in the case of oven drying. The drying method then naturally
affected the performance of the catalysts during autothermal reforming
of isooctane.

Fewer studies are available regarding the thermal
treatment of
a catalyst support. Among the available studies, Keyvanloo et al.21 investigated the effect of calcination temperature
on the properties of iron catalyst supported on silica-stabilized
alumina (Fe/AlSi) for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis reaction. The
supports calcined at 1100–1200 °C were noted to be more
highly reducible, more effectively carbided, and highly reactive for
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis than those traditionally calcined
at 500–800 °C. Lind et al.22 prepared porous alumina via spray drying of nonporous alumina particles;
the spray-dried porous alumina was used as a support for cobalt- and
rhenium-based Fischer–Tropsch catalysts. Agglomeration of nonporous
alumina particles during spray drying was noted to result in an alumina
support with higher porosity.

Despite the aforementioned studies,
the effect of drying technique
of alumina support on the properties of an alumina-supported metal
catalyst has never been investigated. Because infrared drying is known
to exhibit higher heat transfer efficiency and hence higher drying
rate,23 it was postulated that infrared
drying should be able to positively modify the pore structure of the
support, leading to improved catalyst performance. Characteristics
and catalytic activity of copper catalyst prepared from the infrared-dried
alumina support for the synthesis of DME from CO2 were
therefore investigated; the results were compared with those of the
catalyst prepared from the hot air-dried support. The effect of calcination
temperature (600 and 900 °C), which is the required step after
drying, of the alumina supports was also investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Drying Kinetics of Alumina
Supports
Two drying techniques viz. hot air drying and infrared
drying were
used to prepare alumina (Al2O3) supports; drying
was conducted at 40 °C in all cases. The prepared supports were
denoted as Al_HAD and Al_IRD.

Drying curves of the supports
undergoing the two drying processes are shown in Figure 1. Initial moisture content
of the supports was 725% (dry basis); the final moisture content was
22.5% (dry basis). The required drying time in the case of hot air
drying was 235 h, while that in the case of infrared drying was only
59 h; saving of as much as 75% in the drying time was noted when infrared
drying was used. This is ascribed to the fact that infrared radiation
could directly penetrate the matrix of alumina; water molecules in
the matrix directly received the energy and vibrated, resulting in
rapid evaporation of water. On the other hand, the water molecules
in the matrix undergoing hot air drying received the energy by conduction,
which is a slower and less-efficient process than radiation. This
resulted in turn in much slower water removal. More extensive moisture
gradients also existed in the case of hot air drying as the outer
layers of the matrix dried much earlier than the inner layers. This
is because conduction took place from the outer to the inner layers
of the matrix. As a result, the pores of Al_HAD were expected to suffer
more collapse, leading to smaller average pore size and pore volume.24,25 Such an expectation is well verified by the scanning electron microscopic
images and BET analysis results, which will be discussed in the next
section.

Figure 1 Drying curves of alumina supports undergoing hot air drying and
infrared drying at 40 °C.

2.2 Effects of Drying Techniques and Calcination
Temperature on Physiochemical Properties of the Alumina-Supported
Copper Catalyst
Figure 2 shows scanning electron microscopic/energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopic images of synthesized copper catalysts with differently
dried and calcined alumina supports. In terms of the effect of drying
technique, Figure 2a,b,e,f clearly shows that infrared drying resulted in irregularly
spherical-shaped particles but with highly uniform sizes (approximately
5 μm with inter-particle pore sizes of <1 μm). In contrast,
the supports prepared by hot air drying exhibited a large, irregular
structure, with intraparticle pore sizes of approximately 10 μm.
These results illustrated that drying technique had a significant
impact on the shape and size of pores as well as those of the supports.
Infrared drying resulted in better uniformity of copper distribution
on the supports when compared with hot air drying, especially at a
higher calcination temperature (900 °C) (see Figure 2d,h).

Figure 2 SEM and SEM/EDS images
with chemical mapping of copper on copper
catalysts with supports prepared by different drying techniques and
at different calcination temperatures: (a,b) Cu–Al_HAD/600;
(c,d) Cu–Al_HAD/900; (e,f) Cu–Al_IRD/600 and (g,h) Cu–Al_IRD/900.

Effect of calcination temperature can be seen in Figure 2a–d, which
shows the
microstructures of the samples prepared by hot air drying and calcination
at 600 and 900 °C, respectively. These two catalysts exhibited
irregular shapes, with intraparticle pore sizes of 5–10 μm
and smaller particles of 1–2 μm dispersed inside the
pores and/or near the mouths of the pores. Clearly, the intraparticle
pore sizes of Cu–Al_HAD/900 were significantly larger than
those of Cu–Al_HAD/600. Moreover, the smaller particles (i.e.,
copper particles) in the Cu–Al_HAD/900 were more aggregated
than those in Cu–Al_HAD/600. Similarly, as is seen in Figure 2e–h, the particle
sizes of Cu–Al_IRD/900 were larger; there was less uniformity
of the particles in Cu–Al_IRD/900 than in Cu–Al_IRD/600.
These results suggested that a higher calcination temperature caused
more aggregation of the particles, resulting in larger particle sizes;
in other words, catalyst sintering took place.12 Nevertheless, it is seen that the morphology as well as
copper distribution within the catalysts depended more on the drying
technique than on the calcination temperature.

Figure 3 shows X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of alumina supports (Figure 3a) and those of alumina-supported copper
catalysts whose supports were prepared using different drying techniques
and at different calcination temperatures (Figure 3b). In Figure 3a, the characteristic peaks of the XRD spectra (2θ
= 20.0, 37.6, 39.0, 45.8, 60.0, and 67.3) corresponded to those of
γ-Al2O3.26 The
degree of crystallinity of the support prepared (at the same calcination
temperature) by hot air drying was higher than that prepared by infrared
drying. When comparing the supports prepared using the same drying
techniques, increasing the calcination temperature from 600 to 900
°C resulted in a higher degree of crystallinity. In Figure 3b, CuO crystals (2θ
= 32.5, 35.5, 38.8, and 48.6°) (PDF 01-080-1916) can be observed.
Similarly, the peak intensities of CuO increased with the calcination
temperature, indicating higher crystallinity values. These XRD patterns
suggested that both drying technique and calcination temperatures
have a significant influence on the crystal structure of the supports
and catalysts.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of (a) alumina supports and (b) copper catalysts
with
supports prepared by different drying techniques and at different
calcination temperatures.

The results on BET surface area, average pore size, and pore volume
of the alumina supports and alumina-supported copper catalysts are
presented in Table 1 and Figure 4. All
of the supports were noted to possess pore sizes in the range of 5–20
nm, making them a mesoporous material. BET surface area, pore size,
and pore volume of Al_HAD/600 were smaller than those of Al_IRD/600;
these results are in good agreement with those discussed in Section 2.1. Similar trends
were observed for the samples calcined at 900 °C. After loading
copper via the process of impregnation, BET surface areas of all catalysts
decreased, while pore sizes increased. This is due to the fact that
CuO particles accumulated near the mouths of the pores and/or partially
blocked the pores of the supports, thus reducing the surface area
of the impregnated catalysts. On the other hand, CuO particles could
create interparticle voids and hence the increased interparticle pore
sizes.12 CuO particles could also fill
the pores of the supports; this should have resulted in lower pore
volumes of the catalysts.27 Nevertheless,
it was noted here that the pore volume of Cu–Al_HAD/900 was
slightly larger than that of Al_HAD/900. Accordingly to Dumas et al.28 and López-Suárez et al.29 who recommended that copper loading should be
3–6.25 wt % per alumina support surface area of 100 m2/g, Al_HAD/900, which had a surface area of 112 m2/g (the
lowest surface area among our tested supports), was supposed to be
loaded with 3.4–7 wt % copper. However, because our copper
loading was 10%, excess CuO particles could accumulate outside the
pores and created new pores in the form of interparticle voids. Note
that copper loading above the suitable level would not increase the
activity of the catalysts.29

Figure 4 illustrates
the N2-sorption isotherms of alumina supports and alumina-supported
copper catalysts. The isotherm plots confirm that all of the samples
were mesoporous in nature. Interestingly, hysteresis loops of all
the samples prepared via infrared drying (see Figure 4a,c) were found to be H1, implying that their
pores were cylindrical in shape. In contrast, all of the samples prepared
via hot air drying exhibited H2 hysteresis loops, indicating that
their pores were of ink-bottle shape and constituted a complex pore
structure. Note that pores with an ink-bottle shape are able to serve
as barriers for diffusion of reactants and products of the reaction
when compared with pores of regular shape.25Figure 4b,d shows
that pore size distributions of the samples prepared by infrared drying
were wider than those of the samples prepared by hot air drying.

Peak areas of the samples dried by the same techniques but calcined
at different temperatures were different; the samples calcined at
600 °C exhibited larger peak areas than the samples calcined
at 900 °C (see Figure 4b,d). These results are consistent with those of the total
pore volume reported in Table 1. This implies that increasing the calcination temperature
led to collapse of pores and aggregation of smaller particles into
larger particles, together resulting in the reduction of the total
pore volume.12

The synthesized catalysts
were further evaluated using H2-TPR measurement to investigate
interactions between copper particles
and alumina support; the results are presented in Figure 5 and Table S1. H2-TPR profiles of each catalyst were noted
to be in the temperature range of 200–350 °C. The Cu–Al_IRD/600
profile exhibited a single peak at 213 °C, representing H2-reduction of the highly dispersed small CuO particles on
the support.30 On the other hand, the Cu–Al_IRD/900
profile exhibited one sharp peak at 209 °C and one broad peak
at 264 °C; the peaks are attributed to H2-reduction
of the highly dispersed small CuO particles on the support and to
the isolated bulk CuO particles.30 The
Cu–Al_HAD/600 profile exhibited two sharp peaks at 216 and
233 °C; these peaks are associated with the highly dispersed
small CuO particles on the support and to the large CuO particles
that had an interaction with alumina, respectively.12 In the case of Cu–Al_HAD/900, three peaks were observed.
The peaks at 208 and 307 °C were similar to those belonging to
Cu–Al_IRD/900 at 209 and 264 °C, respectively, while the
new peak at 238 °C represents the large CuO particles that interacted
with the support. It is interesting to note that the H2-reduction peak of the isolated bulk CuO particles of Cu–Al_HAD/900
exhibited a higher H2-reduction temperature than that of
Cu–Al_IRD/900. This is because the bulk CuO particles of Cu–Al_HAD/900
were larger than those of Cu–Al_IRD/900. These H2-TPR results are consistent with the microscopic results in Figure 2 in which (i) the
catalysts whose alumina supports were prepared via infrared drying
exhibited highly dispersed CuO particles on the supports, and (ii)
the higher calcination temperature of the support resulted in the
aggregation of small particles. The H2-consumption measurement
data also suggested that the suitable temperature for reducing CuO
to Cu prior to the reaction is 350 °C.

of copper catalysts with supports prepared
by different drying techniques and at different calcination temperatures.

Figure 6 and Table S1 show NH3-TPD profiles as
well as the number of acid sites of alumina-supported copper catalysts
with supports prepared using different drying techniques and at different
calcination temperatures. A total of three NH3 desorption
peaks can be observed; the peaks were distributed in the temperature
ranges 100–200 °C (denoted as peak α), 200–400
°C (denoted as peak β), and 400–600 °C (denoted
as peak γ). α, β, and γ peaks are attributed
to weak, medium, and strong acid sites on the catalysts, respectively.
Cu–Al_IRD/600 exhibited the highest intensities of both α
and β peaks; this was followed in the descending order by Cu–Al_IRD/900,
Cu–Al_HAD/600, and Cu–Al_HAD/900. Broad long-tailed
γ peak of strong acid sites was observed in the cases of Cu–Al_HAD/600
and Cu–Al_HAD/900, while it was not presented in Cu–Al_IRD/600
and Cu–Al_IRD/900. Keshavarz et al.31 and Sun et al.32 indeed reported that
smaller sized catalysts and better dispersion of copper particles
on the support resulted in higher concentrations of weak and medium
acid sites.

Figure 6 NH3-TPD profiles of copper catalysts with supports prepared
by different drying techniques and at different calcination temperatures.

The relationships between acidic properties and
catalytic performance
of catalysts for methanol dehydration for DME synthesis have previously
been studied. It has been reported that the acid sites of weak and
medium strength are responsible for the selective formation of DME,33,34 while strong acid sites could accelerate the formation of by-products
such as CO and CO2 via the reverse water gas shift reaction
(CO2 + H2 ↔ CO + H2O, ΔH = 41.2 kJ mol–1)34 and hence a decrease in DME selectivity.35 These reported results are consistent with our results
in Section 2.3. All
these results confirmed that infrared drying could prevent the aggregation
of copper particles, even when the higher calcination temperature
was used. Infrared drying indeed led to the maintenance of weak and
medium acid sites, which helped promote the activity of the catalysts
for DME production. It is important to note that according to Seo
et al.,36 Roy et al.,37 and Bateni and Abel,38 γ-Al2O3 only possesses Lewis acid sites. Therefore,
the determined acid sites of alumina in our present study should only
possess the Lewis acid character.

2.3 Catalytic
Performance of Alumina-Supported
Copper Catalysts
Copper catalysts whose supports were prepared
using the two drying techniques and then calcined at 600 and 900 °C
were used to catalyze the synthesis of DME via CO2 hydrogenation.
The results are plotted in terms of CO2 conversion as well
as selectivity of CH3OH (methanol), CO, and CH3OCH3 (DME) as a function of reaction temperature as shown
in Figure 7. The reaction
was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at reaction temperatures of
240–320 °C, a pressure of 30 atm, and a CO2/H2 volume ratio of 1:3.

Figure 7 (a) CO2 conversion; (b) CO
selectivity; (c) CH3OH selectivity; and (d) CH3OCH3 selectivity
of copper catalysts with supports prepared by different drying techniques
and at different calcination temperatures.

It is seen in Figure 7a that CO2 conversions of the catalysts whose supports
were calcined at 900 °C were lower than those of the catalysts
whose supports were calcined at 600 °C, regardless of the applied
drying technique. This is ascribed to the more extensive aggregation
(or sintering) of active copper particles at the higher calcination
temperature as discussed in Section 2.2. The highest CO2 conversion
was noted to be 34.4%, achieved via the use of Cu–Al_HAD/600
at 320 °C.

As is seen in Figure 7b, an increase in the reaction temperature
resulted in the higher
CO selectivity. This is because the reverse water gas shift dominated
at higher temperatures. Cu–Al_HAD/900 yielded the maximum CO
selectivity of 93.4% at 320 °C. On the other hand, methanol and
DME selectivity values decreased with increasing reaction temperature
(see Figure 7c,d, respectively).
This is because the reverse water gas shift reaction (eq 2) became more kinetically favored
over the hydrogenation reaction to synthesize methanol from CO2 (eq 1) as well
as over the dehydration reaction to synthesize DME from methanol (eq 3) at higher temperatures.

Figure 7d illustrates
that DME selectivity of Cu–Al_IRD catalysts was significantly
higher than that of Cu–Al_HAD catalysts. This is due to the
fact that Cu–Al_IRD catalysts had larger pore sizes and higher
intensities of weak and medium acid sites than Cu–Al_HAD catalysts
(see Table 1). In addition,
as mentioned earlier, the pores of Al_IRD catalysts were of cylindrical
shape, while those of Al_HAD catalysts were of ink-bottle shape. Diffusion
of the products (methanol and DME) out from the catalyst pores of
larger sizes and more regular shape was naturally expected to be faster,
leading therefore to less decomposition of the products into CO.39,40

Productivities of methanol and DME are plotted in terms of
space-time
yield as a function of reaction temperature as shown in Figure 8a,b, respectively. As is seen
in Figure 8a, Cu–Al_IRD/600
resulted in the highest space-time yield of methanol (59.7 gMeOH kgcat–1 h–1) at 260
°C. The activity of the catalysts for producing methanol can
be ordered as follows: Cu–Al_IRD/600 > Cu–Al_HAD/600
> Cu–Al_IRD/900 > Cu–Al_HAD/900. Catalysts whose
alumina
supports were calcined at 600 °C provided higher space-time yield
of methanol than the one whose alumina supports were calcined at 900
°C, regardless of the employed drying techniques. This is because
when calcination was conducted at 600 °C, copper particles were
better dispersed than doing so at 900 °C.

Figure 8 Influence of reaction
temperature on (a) space-time yield of CH3OH and (b) CH3OCH3 of copper catalysts
with supports prepared by different drying techniques and at different
calcination temperatures.

It is seen in Figure 8b that starting from 240 °C, the space-time yields of DME of
all catalysts gradually increased with increasing reaction temperature
up to the maximum value of 40.9 gDME kgcat–1 h–1 at 300 °C; the values
then rapidly decreased. The space-time yield of DME of the catalysts
can be ordered as follows: Cu–Al_IRD/600 > Cu–Al_IRD/900
> Cu–Al_HAD/600 > Cu–Al_HAD/900. The performance
of
Cu–Al_IRD catalysts to synthesize DME was more promising than
that of Cu–Al_HAD catalysts because of the superior pore characteristics
of the former as previously illustrated in Figure 7d.

Performance of Cu catalyst with
commercial alumina as the support
(commercial Cu–Al) was also investigated (see Figure S1). It was observed that DME selectivity of the commercial
Cu–Al catalyst was higher than that of our synthesized catalysts.
This is because the commercial catalyst had larger pore sizes than
our catalysts (see Table 1). However, the commercial catalyst resulted in a lower space-time
yields of methanol and DME than Cu–Al_IRD/600 (by about 56.7
and 35.5%, respectively) at the reaction temperature of 300 °C.
This is because of the lower surface area of the commercial catalyst,
despite its superior dispersion of copper particles (see Figure S2).

The stability of the catalysts
was finally examined to determine
whether they could potentially be used in industry. The catalysts
were evaluated under the same pressure and CO2/H2 feed gas ratio but at the reaction temperature of 280 °C; the
reaction was monitored for 24 h. CO2 conversions (Figure 9a) and methanol conversions
(Figure 9b) of all
catalysts slightly decreased over time, with approximately 10–30%
reduction in conversion occurring within 24 h. This is ascribed to
sintering of active copper particles.41,42 Performance
in terms of CO2 conversion and methanol conversion of the
catalysts whose alumina supports were calcined at 600 °C was
superior to that of the catalysts whose alumina supports were calcined
at 900 °C because of the better dispersion of copper particles
of the former as explained earlier. Interestingly, although CO2 conversions were observed to decrease with time, the space-time
yields of DME were remarkably stable over the 24 h period (Figure 9c). This is because
methanol and DME molecules are generated at different active sites;
the active sites for methanol and DME formations are copper and alumina
surfaces, respectively.8 This suggested
that DME active sites exhibited excellent stability throughout the
24 h period. Nevertheless, during a longer time-on-stream experiment,
DME space-time yield may decrease because of a decrease in methanol
as the substantial reactant for the synthesis of DME.

Figure 9 Influence of reaction
time on (a) CO2 conversion, (b)
CH3OH space-time yield, and (c) CH3OCH3 space-time yield of copper catalysts with supports prepared by different
drying techniques and at different calcination temperatures.

Drying technique of the alumina support had a more
significant
effect than calcination temperature on the space-time yield of DME.
The plots in Figure 9 indicate that the catalytic activity of the Cu-loaded alumina catalyst
is highly stable for DME synthesis throughout 24 h, and the Cu–Al_IRD/600
catalyst exhibits the highest DME space-time yield.

3 Conclusions
The effect of using hot air and infrared drying
to prepare alumina
supports for a copper catalyst was investigated. Infrared drying could
shorten the drying time by 75% when compared with hot air drying and
at the same time helped lessen shrinkage, resulting in larger pore
size, pore volume, and surface area of the supports. Interestingly,
infrared drying led to pores of cylindrical shape, while hot air drying
resulted in pores of ink-bottle shape; the former technique also resulted
in higher intensities of weak and medium acid sites of the catalyst.
These results synergistically led to higher activity of the catalyst.
In the case of calcination temperature, a higher temperature resulted
in a decrease in the surface area of catalyst because of aggregation
of particles as well as copper dispersion on the supports. Moreover,
the crystallite size of CuO increased with increased calcination temperature.
The Cu–Al_IRD/600 catalyst exhibited the highest space-time
yield of DME (40.9 gDME kgcat–1 h–1) at the reaction temperature of 300 °C,
while the highest space-time yield of methanol (59.7 gMeOH kgcat–1 h–1) was
achieved at the reaction temperature of 260 °C. Time-on-stream
tests of all synthesized catalysts revealed that the catalyst stability
for DME synthesis was excellent throughout 24 h of the tests.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals
Polyethylene
oxide (PEO)
(99% purity), propylene oxide (PO) (≥99% purity), aluminum
chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3·6H2O) (99%
purity), copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) (99% purity), and silicon dioxide (SiO2) (99.5% purity) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). γ-Aluminum oxide (99.97% purity) was obtained from Alfa
Aesar (Ward Hill, MA) and used as the commercial alumina support.
Ethanol (99.9% purity) was purchased from RCI Lab-Scan (Bangkok, Thailand).
Hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2) Helium (He),
and argon (Ar) gases (99.999% of purity) were obtained from Thai Special
Gas (Pathumthani, Thailand).

4.2 Preparation of Alumina
Supports
Porous
alumina supports were prepared as per the recommended methods of Tokudome
et al.43 PEO (0.08 g) was added into a
mixture of ethanol (5.5 mL) and deionized (DI) water (4 mL). The mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After this, 4.32 g of AlCl3·6H2O was added into the mixture; stirring
continued until a clear solution was obtained. Then, 3.75 mL of PO
was added into the mixture; the mixture was stirred for 1 min, after
which it was kept in a closed system at 40 °C for 24 h. Later,
the mixture was divided into two samples. The first sample was dried
at 40 °C using a hot-air dryer (Memmert GmbH, UM400, Schwabach,
Germany), while the second sample was dried using an infrared dryer
at 40 °C; the infrared dryer was the one proposed and tested
by Niamnuy et al.44

Both dried samples
were calcined under stagnant air at ambient humidity at 600 or 900
°C for 12 h; a heating rate of 10 °C/min was used. Finally,
white solids of porous alumina were obtained. Before alumina was used
as a catalyst support, each sample were sieved to collect the particles
in the size range of 425–600 μm.

4.3 Preparation
of Alumina-Supported Copper Catalysts
To create monolayer
distribution of copper, Dumas et al.28 and
López-Suárez et al.29 suggested
that a suitable amount of copper loaded
onto an alumina support should depend on the surface area of the support.
The recommended copper loading was 3–5 wt % per alumina support
surface area of 100 m2/g. Because the BET surface area
of our synthesized alumina support varied in the range of 149–290
m2/g, the content of copper loaded onto each support was
controlled at 10 wt %.27

Copper loading
on both the synthesized and commercial alumina supports was conducted
by the incipient wetness impregnation method as follows: 0.419 g of
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved
in 2.5 mL of DI water; the contents were then mixed with 1 g of alumina.
After this, the mixture was stirred at 60 °C until dried. The
sample was then calcined under stagnant air at ambient humidity at
600 °C for 2 h; a heating rate of 2 °C/min was used. The
synthesized copper catalysts, whose supports were dried by hot-air
drying (HAD) and infrared drying (IRD) and calcined at 600 and 900
°C, were denoted as Cu–Al_HAD/600, Cu–Al_HAD/900,
Cu–Al_IRD/600, and Cu–Al_IRD/900 catalysts, respectively.

4.4 Moisture Content Determination
Moisture
content of a sample was gravimetrically determined using AOAC method
984.25.45 About 5 g of the sample was dried
at 105 °C until no change in mass was detected.

4.5 Catalyst Characterization
Surface
morphology of alumina-supported copper catalysts was assessed with
the use of a scanning electron microscope (FEI, Quanta 450, Hillsboro,
OR) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The measurements
were made at 20 kV. The samples were sputter-coated with gold prior
to each measurement.

XRD patterns of alumina supports and alumina-supported
copper catalysts were obtained using a diffractometer (JEOL, JDX-3530,
Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation at 45 kV and 40 mA. The measurements
were made at room temperature in a 2θ range of 15–75°
with a step size of 0.05°. The diffraction patterns were analyzed
according to the guidelines of the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction
Standards.

BET surface area, mesopore size distribution, and
pore volume of
alumina supports and alumina-supported copper catalysts were determined
by N2-sorption measurement using a gas physisorption analyzer
(Quantachrome, Autosorb-1C, Boynton Beach, FL) at −196 °C.

Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were conducted
using a thermal analyzer (TA Instruments, SDT 2960 Simultaneous DSC–TGA,
New Castle, DE). A sample (10 mg) was heated to 350 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min under a He atmosphere; the final temperature
was maintained for 30 min. Subsequently, the sample was cooled to
100 °C and stabilized. The sample was again heated to 400 °C
under flowing 10% (v/v) H2 (He as a balance gas) at a heating
rate of 4 °C/min.

Temperature-programmed desorption using
ammonia as a probe molecule
(NH3-TPD) was conducted on a TPDRO apparatus (Thermo Scientific,
TPDRO 1100, Waltham, MA) to investigate the acidity of the catalysts.
A sample (0.2 g) was pretreated with He flow (30 mL/min) at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min until 400 °C was reached; the final temperature
was maintained for 60 min. Then, the sample was cooled to 100 °C.
Subsequently, 10% (v/v) NH3 (He as a balance gas) at a
flow rate of 30 mL/min was introduced to the sample for 1 h. The NH3 flow was then disconnected, and the sample was flushed with
He at a flow rate of 30 mL/min for 1 h to remove physisorbed NH3. NH3 desorption analysis was carried out under
the flow of He (30 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from
100 to 600 °C. The intensity of acid sites was determined from
the weight loss because of desorption of NH3.

4.6 Activity Test of Catalysts
The synthesized
alumina-supported copper catalyst (0.5 g) was mixed with 0.5 g of
SiO2, which was used to maintain isothermal conditions
in the catalyst bed and packed in a stainless steel tube (316, 3/8
inches ID). H2 reduction of CuO to Cu(0) was conducted
by feeding Ar at 60 mL/min at a reaction temperature of 100 °C
and pressure of 1 atm for 1 h. The reaction temperature was then ramped
to 350 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C/min. Ar was then switched
to H2 while the final temperature was maintained for 4
h. The reaction temperature was then reduced to 200 °C under
the flow of N2. Subsequently, the system was pressurized
to 30 atm using a mixture of CO2 and H2 (at
a CO2/H2 molar ratio of 1:3). The total feeding
gas was set at 60 mL/min. The tested reaction temperature was either
240, 260, 280, 300, or 320 °C.

A stability test was carried
out at 280 °C and 30 atm for 24 h. All postreactor lines and
valves were first heated to 120 °C to avoid condensation of reaction
products. The effluent gaseous products were analyzed using gas chromatography.
Analysis of H2, CO, CO2, and N2 was
performed using gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-2014, Kyoto, Japan)
equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a Unibead-C column.
Methanol, DME, and other hydrocarbon products were analyzed using
another gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-8A, Kyoto, Japan) equipped
with a flame ionization detector and a Chromosorb WAW (20% PEG) column.

Blank reactor experiments (with no catalyst) were run at a reaction
temperatures of 300 °C to confirm the absence of activity of
SiO2. No reaction products were detected. The activity–selectivity
data were calculated by the mass balance from an average of three
independent measurements. Selectivity was calculated taking into account
the three major products: methanol, CO, and DME; the errors were within
±3% CO2 conversion. CO2 conversion, selectivity
to methanol, CO, and DME, and space-time yields of methanol and DME
are defined as follows 4   5   6   7   8   9  where VCO2 is
the volumetric flow of CO2 in cm3/min; MWmethanol and MWDME are the molecular
weights of methanol and DME in g/mol, respectively; MV is the molar
volume of an ideal gas, which is 22,400 cm3/mol at the
studied conditions.
