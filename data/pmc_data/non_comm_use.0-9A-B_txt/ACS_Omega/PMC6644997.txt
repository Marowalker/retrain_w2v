The
inhibitory effect of two heterocyclic porphyrin compounds,
specifically 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin palladium(II) (PF-1) and 4,4′,4″,4‴-(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzoic
acid) (PF-2), was studied in a sweet corrosion environment (3.5 wt
% NaCl + CO2) on J55 steel by means of weight loss and
electrochemical methods. Surface changes were studied using contact
angle, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) techniques. It was established that PF-2 showed the
superlative inhibition efficiency of average of about 93% at 400 ppm
concentration. The inductive behavior of the J55 steel surface in
the presence of inhibitors was confirmed by SECM. The AFM further
confirmed that the surface roughness was considerably decreased in
the presence of porphyrins. The surface wettability of the steel was
also investigated, and the results established the formation of a
water-repellant layer on the surface when porphyrins are absorbed
and layer became more hydrophobic with PF-2. Thermodynamics studies
showed that the inhibition efficiencies of two compounds evaluated
by all measurements follow the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

==== Body
Introduction
Oilfields in Sichuan and Xinjiang provinces
in China use J55 steel
as the casing pipe and are inserted in the wellbores. Use of J55 steel
is very common owing to its cost effectiveness among other steels
and they have a wide range of applications.1 J55 steel is moderately low grade steel manufactured by both seamless
and electric welding procedure. Sweet corrosion due to the occurrence
of carbon dioxide is a key concern to oilfields and gas fields. Crude
oil in the reservoir is believed to contain carbon dioxide, hydrogen
sulphide, and other impurities.2 The formation
water which is injected back into the reservoir to increase the pressure
and stability is another source of carbon dioxide and water in the
oilfield reservoir.3−5 The quantification of carbon dioxide and water in
the reservoir leads to the formation of a weak carbonic acid which
can cause severe corrosion to steel. A series of experiments proved
that, at a given pH, this acid causes higher corrosion problem than
strong mineral acids, similar to hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), which dissociate in water completely.3,6,7

The pitting corrosion formed
along with the uniform corrosion due
to the sweet corrosion (CO2 corrosion) is difficult to
detect under the coatings. This predominant localized attack is common
and considered to be most dangerous for pipeline and casing steel
in oilfields.8−13 The protection of steel from the internal corrosion is difficult
to monitor and that can lead to fearsome accidents, failures, and
ecological catastrophe.3,14 Use of corrosion inhibitors can
provide a suitable solution to the problem that act by modifying the
sweet corrosive environment. Corrosion inhibitors are more pragmatic,
and the nature or the potential of the steel is not hindered by their
addition to the system.15−19 Oilfields indulge corrosion inhibitors frequently as they do not
interrupt with the recovery, production, or transportation of oil
and gas.

Molecular compounds, including heteroatoms such as
nitrogen, sulfur,
and oxygen in addition to aromatic rings or those containing π-electrons
in multiple bonds in their structure having high electron density
are typically effective corrosion inhibitors.20−26 These organic inhibitors operate on the plane by the virtue of adsorption
and influenced by the type of the electrolyte, the nature and surface
morphology of the metal, as well as their chemical structure.27,28 The porphyrin molecules are very rich in heteroatoms, π-electrons,
and multiple bonds intact in their structure. The aromatic rings can
easily bond with the metal surface and their bulky size can cover
the active centers to form a protective layer.29 This is the motivation to use them as potential corrosion
mitigators. In our previous study, we had applied the porphyrins as
inhibitors on N80 steel and J55 steel in a neutral and sweet corrosion
environment and found the remarkable results.30

Results and Discussion
Weight Loss
A plot drawn between
the inhibitor concentration
and efficiency is shown in Figure 1. It can be seen from the figure that the inhibition
efficiency increases with increase in the inhibitor concentration
for both 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin palladium(II) (PF-1) and 4,4′,4″,4‴-(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzoic
acid) (PF-2) inhibitors. The boost in effectiveness with the concentration
can be accredited to the configuration of a defensive layer by PF-1
and PF-2 molecules adsorbing on the metal surface. It is also extracted
from the figure that inhibition efficiency of PF-2 (93%) is more than
that of PF-1 (85%).29

Figure 1 Plot of the inhibitor
concentration vs inhibition efficiency.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Measurements
The Nyquist plot (Figure 2a), Bode plot (Figure 2b), and frequency-phase angle plot (Figure 2c) were obtained for J55 steel in 3.5% NaCl
solution saturated with CO2 and PF solution. A depressed
semicircle can be seen in the Nyquist plot with a capacitive loop
and an inductive loop below the real axis. The formation of this inductive
loop may be ascribed to the frequency dispersion, inhomogeneities,
or steel dissolution.31−34,73 The shape of the Nyquist curves
does not change for different concentrations of PF-1 and PF-2 in saturated
3.5% NaCl solution, but the diameter becomes larger at higher concentrations
of inhibitors. The increase in the diameter is due to the better corrosion
resistance of the J55 steel which may be credited to the inhibitor
molecules blocking the active centers on the surface. PF-2 shows a
bigger diameter than PF-1, indicating better adsorption of the inhibitor
molecules causing the shielding effect on the metal surface and protecting
it from the corrosive solution.35,36,73

used for J55 steel in 3.5% NaCl solution in the absence and presence
of porphyrins.

Figure 2d shows
an equivalent circuit used in the study consisting of charge transfer
resistors (Rct), in series, with inductance
(L), a resistor (Rs)
representing the solution
resistance, and constant phase element (CPE) used instead of capacitance
to fit the curve precisely. The CPE (ZCPE) with respect to impedance can be explained by30 1  Or this may be shown as 2  where ω is the angular
frequency, n is a physical factor with an experiential
constraint (0
≤ n ≤ 1), and f is
the frequency in Hz. A lower value (n = 0.695) obtained
for sweet 3.5% NaCl solution indicates surface inhomogeneity caused
because of roughness or corrosion products on the metal surface.37 The higher value of n (0.816)
in the presence of inhibitors exhibits reduction in surface inhomogeneity
because of the formation of a shield on the active centers present
on the metal surface.

The impedance constraints obtained after
fitting the curves with
the help of circuit are listed in Table 1. Charge transfer value increases with increase
in the inhibitor concentration because of the increase in the width
of the electrical double layer and decrease in the local dielectric
constant. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the adsorption of inhibitor
molecules on the metal surface, thereby jamming the active sites at
the metal–solution interface.38,39 PF-2 shows
better inhibition efficiency of 92% at 400 ppm with an Rct value of 1490 Ω cm2, whereas PF-1
was limited to 85% at 400 ppm with Rct value of 810 Ω cm2.

It can be observed from Figure 2b,c that the low
frequency impedance modulus increases
in the presence of inhibitors than that in saturated 3.5% NaCl solution
and phase angle shifts toward higher frequencies in the presence of
inhibitors. The slope values of the saturated 3.5% NaCl solution (0.491),
PF-1 (0.692), and PF-2 inhibitor (0.784) is close to 1, as shown in Table 2. This exhibits that
the adsorption of the inhibitors on the J55 steel surface mitigates
the corrosion.40 The phase angle–frequency
plot for sweet 3.5% NaCl solution shows the utmost peak at 32.7°,
PF-1 shows the top peak at 56.7°, and PF-2 shows the highest
peak at 71.3°. The maximum peak values tend to approach toward
90°, which is a characteristic capacitive behavior and inherited
by good corrosion mitigators.41

3.5% NaCl solution at room temperature with and without PF-1 and PF-2
inhibitors. The calculated values of the corrosion current density

efficiency (η %) are shown in Table 3.29

Table 3 shows the
magnitude of ba and −bc, Ecorr, and Icorr values changed without following a definite trend.
The cathodic and anodic slopes decreased and the Ecorr values shifted within 85 mV, suggesting that PF-1
and PF-2 belong to mixed-type inhibitors. The mixed inhibitor action
is effective on hydrogen evolution and metal dissolution, simultaneously,
without modifying the overall course mechanism by covering the dynamic
sites.42 The decrease in Icorr values from 0.98 mA cm–2 for saturated
3.5% NaCl solution to 0.14 mA cm–2 for PF-1 and
0.07 mA cm–2 for PF-2 shows increase in the corrosion
resistance of the J55 steel because of the molecules of inhibitors
getting adsorbed on the surface. The adsorption of the inhibitor molecules
can take place through π-bonding/reterodonation covering the
available active regions and thereby mitigating corrosion.43

Adsorption Behavior of the Inhibitor
Validation of
PF-1 and PF-2 molecules adsorbing on the metal surface and the interactions
between metal–inhibitor at the interface was explained through
adsorption isotherms. Surface coverage (θ) is linked with the
adsorbate in the bulk of electrolyte (Cinh) as in the subsequent equation.44 3  where Kads is
the equilibrium constant for the adsorption/desorption process. The
equation can be rewritten as 4  

Several adsorption isotherms were tried
to fit the weight loss values to get a linear fit. However, adsorption
of PF-1 and PF-2 molecules followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
A plot between Cinh/θ versus Cinh (Figure 4) gave linear-fit plots of PF-1 and PF-2 molecules
with the correlation coefficient (R2)
ranging 0.99966 for PF-1 and 0.99998 for PF-2. Kads can be interrelated to free energy of adsorption, ΔGads° as45 5  where R is the gas constant
and the value 55.5 represents the concentration of water in solution
expressed in mol L–1. The values of Kads and ΔGads° for PF-1 and PF-2 inhibitors
are given in Table 4. The higher values of Kads (14483 M–1) for PF-1 and (37535 M–1) for PF-2
represent high affinity for adsorption isotherm. The negative values
−33.6 kJ mol–1 of ΔGads° for
PF-1 and −36.0 kJ mol–1 for PF-2 ensure the
spontaneity of the adsorption process and stability of the adsorbed
film over the steel surface. The values lie between 20 and 40 kJ mol–1 that perhaps suggests that both physical and chemical
adsorption would occur.46

Contact
Angle
The surface of the J55 steel acted hydrophilic
in 3.5% NaCl solution as is evident by the value 14.7°, while
an increase in the contact angle (87.9°) for PF-1 and (102.3)
for PF-2 was observed as is depicted in Figure 5. The increase in the contact angle with
concentration can be attributed to the hydrophobic metal surface because
of the presence of inhibitor film.47 As
can be seen from Figure 5, the hydrophobic nature of the metal increases with increase in
the inhibitor concentration as the bulky inhibitor molecules form
a film and cover the entire surface.

plots for porphyrins.

Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM)
SECM tests
were performed in ac-amperometry mode to get the 3-D figures and color
map images of the metal surface in 3.5% NaCl solution and inhibited
solutions.48 To ensure a similar distance
of the tip at the metal surface for all the samples, the probe approach
test was done prior to each test. The x-axis and y-axis color map and 3-D images are shown in Figure 6a–h.49

NaCl y-axis (b) 3.5% NaCl x-axis

A variation in the color map images of x-axis
and y-axis of sweet 3.5% NaCl, PF-1, and PF-2 solution
was observed as shown in Figure 6a,c,e. The variation is related to the current as it
changes with the vicinity of the tip at the metal surface. As can
be observed from the color map of the PF-1 and PF-2 inhibitors, the
surface color is less varied in comparison to the 3.5% NaCl solution.
This suggests that the surface is uniform and smooth in the presence
of PF-1 and PF-2 while it begins to form cracks leading to surface
roughness.50,73 When the tip is brought near
the metal surface in sweet 3.5% NaCl solution, an increase in current
can be seen both on x-axis and y-axis as shown in Figure 6b. The increase in the current is due to the direct contact
of tip with the metal surface without any protective barriers. Thus,
oxygen/solution diffusion can take place easily at the metal surface
giving rise to corrosion.51−53 In the presence of PF-1 and PF-2
inhibitors, the current was seen to decrease as the tip approaches
the metal surface as shown in Figure 6d,f. This may be due to the adsorbed inhibitor film
formed on the metal surface that blocks the oxygen/solution diffusion.
The J55 steel surface behaves conducting in sweet 3.5% NaCl solution
(higher current) whereas it remains insulating in the presence of
PF-1 and PF-2 inhibitors (lower current).54

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
To extract more lines
of evidence for the changes in surface morphology exposed to 3.5%
NaCl solution and inhibitor solutions, AFM images were analyzed. The
three-dimensional AFM images of the steel surface in saturated 3.5%
NaCl solution showed a corroded surface and the maximum peak of surface
roughness reached up to 200 nm as shown in Figure 7a. This may be due to the absence of a protective
film on the metal surface.30 In the presence
of the PF-1 inhibitor, the surface appears more uniform and the peak
of surface roughness decreases to 100 nm as shown in Figure 7b. The peak of surface roughness
was further observed to be 5.1 nm for the PF-2 inhibitor as the surface
remains flat and smooth as shown in Figure 7c. These results vindicate that PF-1 and
PF-2 can serve as potential corrosion mitigators for J55 steel.55

PF-1, and (c) PF-2.

Inhibition Mechanism
Information on adsorption of the
inhibitor molecules on the metal surface can help to elucidate the
mitigation process in the sweet corrosive environment. Heteroatoms
such as N, F, and O help PF-1 and PF-2 molecules to form bonds/complexes
with the steel and protects from the attack of 3.5% NaCl solution
saturated with CO2. The conjugated bonds and aromatic rings
containing unshared π-electrons also contribute in the complex
formation between the metal and the inhibitor.56,67 The lone pair of electrons is donated to the vacant d-orbitals of
the Fe atoms (chemical adsorption) and filled orbitals of Fe gives
back electrons to inhibitor molecules via reterodonation (back-bonding)
thus, forming a strong protection layer.57

Carbonic acid is produced as the water molecules present in
3.5% NaCl solution reacts with carbon dioxide passed in the solution.
The formation of acid in the solution cause the steel surface to turn
positively charged and also accounts for protonation of the inhibitor
molecules as shown in Figure 8. At the start Cl– ions from the solution
may get adsorbed on the positively charged steel surface, and then,
the protonated inhibitor interacts with the Cl– and
get adsorb through electrostatic interactions (physical adsorption),
by forming a protective layer (FeCl– inhibitor+)ads.58,59,73

Conclusions
From the result of the present study, PF-1
and PF-2 inhibits corrosion
of J55 steel in a sweet corrosion environment. PF-2 shows a better
inhibition efficiency of 95% from the weight loss test, 92% from impedance
studies, and 93% from Tafel polarization measurements than PF-1 at
400 ppm concentration. Addition of the PF-2 inhibitor increased the Rct values from 119 to 1490 Ω cm2. PF-1 and PF-2 acted as mixed-type inhibitors and adsorbed on the
steel surface both physically and chemically. Moreover, the negative
values of ΔGads° revealed the spontaneity of the adsorption
process. The surface wettability test of the steel established the
configuration of a water-repellant layer on the metal surface with
PF-2 being most hydrophobic. Therefore, it can be inferred that the
inhibition roles of PF-1 and PF-2 are through the adsorption at the
metal/solution interface as disclosed by the SECM and AFM micrographs.
The inhibition efficiency followed the order PF-2 > PF-1 for weight
loss and electrochemical studies. All the results are in fine consistency
with each other.

Experimental Section
Materials and Solutions
J55 steel samples (wt %): C
0.24; Si 0.22; Mn 1.1; P 0.103; S 0.004; Cr 0.5; Ni 0.28; Mo 0.021;
Cu 0.019; Fe balance were used for the weight loss and electrochemical
study. The steel coupons were mechanically cut into 30 mm × 3
mm × 3 mm dimensions, mechanically abraded, and washed with double
distilled water followed by ethyl alcohol, respectively, before every
test.60 The 3.5% NaCl solution was prepared
with doubled distilled water, saturated with CO2 for 40
min at 6 MPa, and then sealed with epoxy resin. All the tests were
done using this saturated solution of 3.5% NaCl. Figure 9 represents the molecular structure
of the two different porphyrins used. These porphyrins (400 ppm each)
were refluxed in 3.5% NaCl to prepare inhibitor solutions for tests.61

Methods
Weight Loss Measurements
Five solutions of 25, 50,
100, 200, and 400 ppm for both the porphyrins were prepared for the
weight loss studies. Sample preparation and experiments were done
according to ASTM standards at room temperature for 3 h. The subsequent
equation was used to calculate the corrosion rate (CR). 6  where W is the standard
weight
loss of J55 steel samples, a is the total area of
J55 steel samples, t is the immersion time (in h),
and D is the density of J55 steel in (g cm–3). The inhibition efficiency (η %) was calculated with the
help of the following equation.62 7  where CR represents
the corrosion rate of 3.5% NaCl solution and CRinh represents the
corrosion rate in the presence of inhibitor, respectively.

Electrochemical
Measurements
Electrochemical workstation
of Autolab GSTAT302N including FRC software for EIS measurements and
data fitting was used to perform impedance and polarization studies.
A four-neck cell was used with J55 steel as the working electrode,
a platinum electrode as an auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel
electrode as the reference electrode, and CO2 was passed
in the solution and sealed later with epoxy resin.63 The tests were started after a steady value of corrosion
potential (Ecorr) was obtained.64−66 A potential of ±300 mV versus Ecorr at a scan rate of 1 mV s–1 was applied to obtain
the Tafel curves. EIS measurements were investigated in a frequency
range from 100 to 0.00001 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV peak to peak.67 The analysis of anodic and cathodic Tafel curves
provided corrosion current densities (Icorr) and inhibition efficiency using the subsequent relationship. 8  where Icorr0 represents
the corrosion current
3.5% NaCl solution and Icorrinh represents the corrosion current of
inhibited solution. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) values were obtained from the Nyquist plots and the
inhibition efficiency was calculated using the following equation.68 9  where Rctinh and Rct0 are the charge
transfer resistance in the presence and absence of an inhibitor, respectively.

Contact Angle Measurements
The steel samples were exposed
to the 3.5% NaCl solution and the inhibited solutions of various concentrations
of porphyrins. The sessile drop technique was performed using a DSA100
KRÜSS to record the contact angles on the metal surface. Prior
to each test, the surface was cleaned to avoid dust and contaminants
which can hinder the contact angle, and a baseline test was run to
establish same commencement parameters. All the tests were recorded
three times to get accurate information about the surface.69,70

Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy
SECM analysis was
carried out to examine the electrochemical behavior and possible defects
on the metal surface. The J55 steel sample was used as the working
electrode and a platinum tip was used as the probe, while Ag/AgCl
in saturated KCl was used as the reference and counter electrodes,
respectively.29,71 Line scan measurements were performed
using a CHI900C workstation with a tip approach of ∼10 μm
at the metal surface. Prior to tests, a probe approach was run to
establish the same tip-metal distance for all metal samples.72,73

Atomic Force Microscopy
The surface of the J55 steel
exposed in 3.5% NaCl solution and inhibited solution was studied using
an NT-MDT AFM instrument. The surface roughness of each sample was
recorded using the instrument.30,74
