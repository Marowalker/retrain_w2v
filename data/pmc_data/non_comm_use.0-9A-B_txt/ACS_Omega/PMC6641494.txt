Strain engineering
of nanowires (NWs) has been recognized as a
powerful strategy for tuning the optical and electronic properties
of nanoscale semiconductors. Therefore, the characterization of the
strains with nanometer-scale spatial resolution is of great importance
for various promising applications. In the present work, we synthesized
single-crystalline zinc blende phase GaP and GaAs NWs using the chemical
vapor transport method and visualized their bending strains (up to
3%) with high precision using the nanobeam electron diffraction technique.
The strain mapping at all crystallographic axes revealed that (i)
maximum strain exists along the growth direction ([111]) with the
tensile and compressive strains at the outer and inner parts, respectively;
(ii) the opposite strains appeared along the perpendicular direction
([2̅11]); and (iii) the tensile strain was larger than the coexisting
compressive strain at all axes. The Raman spectrum collected for individual
bent NWs showed the peak broadening and red shift of the transverse
optical modes that were well-correlated with the strain maps. These
results are consistent with the larger mechanical modulus of GaP than
that of GaAs. Our work provides new insight into the bending strain
of III–V semiconductors, which is of paramount importance in
the performance of flexible or bendable electronics.

1 Introduction
One-dimensional
semiconductor nanostructures [typically nanowires
(NWs)] have attracted much attention over the past two decades because
they are promising bottom-up building blocks of future nanodevices.1 Recently, strain engineering of NWs has been
recognized as a powerful strategy for tuning the optical and electronic
properties of nanoscale semiconductors, and thus it is receiving an
increasing amount of attention.3 The prominent
properties of tensile- and compressive-strained NWs are smaller and
larger band gaps, respectively, as compared to those of corresponding
unstrained NWs.2−8 For bent (or buckled) NWs, a red-shifted emission has been observed,
which has been explained by the piezotronic effect, in which under
a piezoelectric field, the number of photons emitted from the outer
surface of the NW is much larger than that from the inner surface.9−13 The outstanding piezoelectric properties of ZnO and CdS NWs have
facilitated the development of various piezotronic and piezo-phototronic
devices such as nanogenerators, field-effect transistors, and light-emitting
diodes, which rely on the piezoelectric potential created along the
strained NWs.3,14−16 Moreover, the
enhanced carrier mobility or photocurrent of strained NWs has attracted
widespread research interest owing to their great potential in a rich
variety of applications.17−24

To expedite the fabrication of advanced flexible electronic
devices,
it is essential to examine the strains with nanometer-scale spatial
resolution so that the modification of the properties can be better
understood. Such nanoscale examination can be carried out using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) techniques such as aberration-corrected
high-resolution TEM (HRTEM),25 electron
diffraction (e.g., convergent beam and nanobeam),26−30 geometrical phase analysis of high-angle annular
dark-field scanning TEM,31 and dark-field
electron holography.32 In particular, a
precession-assisted nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED) technique
had been developed to visualize the strain of materials with high
precision.28−30 This technique makes use of electron beam precession
together with spot diffraction pattern recognition, resulting in reliable
strain maps with a spatial resolution down to 2 nm and excellent precision
(0.02%) on a field emission gun TEM.33,34 Furthermore,
the NBED technique has a great advantage to provide the strain distribution
at a specific crystallographic axis. Nevertheless, strain mapping
using NBED for strained NWs has not been reported yet. The strain
distribution at individual crystallographic axis would provide valuable
information to understand their novel properties.

In the present
work, GaP and GaAs NWs were synthesized using the
chemical vapor transport method. The NWs exhibited a single-crystalline
zinc blende (ZB) phase with a uniform growth direction ([111]). The
NWs were bent by the mechanical buckling of poly(dimethylsilioxane)
(PDMS), which transformed the initially straight NWs into wavy shapes
via releasing of the prestrain.35 For strain
mapping of the bent NWs, we performed NBED processing using a NanoMEGAS’s
“Digistar” add-on device.33 Moreover, because Raman spectroscopy is one of the most straightforward
and broadly used techniques to monitor the strains of the NWs,6,19,36−40 we collected Raman spectra for individual GaP (or
GaAs) NWs. The aim of the current study was to correlate the bending
strains of the NWs with their Raman spectrum to provide insight into
lattice distortion within the NWs.

2 Results
and Discussion
We synthesized GaP and GaAs NWs on Si substrates
with high yield
using a typical vapor–liquid–solid growth mechanism,
which makes use of Au nanoparticles as catalysts for growth. The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) peaks of the GaP and GaAs NWs were assigned to the
ZB phase of GaP (JCPDS Card no. 32-0397; a = 5.450
Å) and GaAs (JCPDS Card no. 80-0016; a = 5.654
Å), respectively, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and HRTEM images show that
GaP and GaAs NWs all had a straight and smooth surface, with no amorphous
oxide layer shell (Figure 1a,b, respectively). The average diameter is 160 nm. Figure 1c,d shows the HRTEM
and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images (zone axis =
[011̅]) of the GaP and GaAs NWs, respectively, revealing their
single-crystalline ZB phase and [111] growth direction. The d-spacings between neighboring (111) planes of the GaP and
GaAs NWs were 3.15 and 3.26 Å, respectively, which are the same
as those of the bulk: d111 = 3.1460 Å
(GaP) and 3.2643 Å (GaAs).

a general morphology.

of individual (c) GaP and (d) GaAs NWs.

We then examined the strain mapping of NWs subjected to bending
deformation. The NWs were directly transferred from the sample substrates
onto a holey carbon TEM grid by rubbing. Some of the NWs were lying
bent, which provided an opportunity to evaluate their atomic structures
under bending strain. Thus, bent NWs with various curvatures were
examined. The present NBED technique allows the relative extent of
lattice fringe distortion across the NWs to be evaluated with respect
to an unstrained area within the projected lattice, which is taken
as a reference. The two-dimensional mapping of the lattice expansion
(positive value) or contraction (negative value) relative to a reference
(d0), that is, (d – d0)/d0 × 100%,
was carried out for each NBED pattern spot. The reference was taken
at the center of the NW (marked by the dots in the maps), where presumably
no lattice deformation occurred. The precision of the strain was <0.03%,
and the spatial resolution was 4 nm.

Figure 2 shows an
HRTEM image of a GaP NW along the [011̅] zone axis, the NBED
pattern for the marked region in the HRTEM image, and the corresponding
strain maps and profiles. The NW diameter was 150 nm, and the local
diameter of curvature was 5.6 μm (Figure 2a). The bending strain (ε) of the NW
was estimated using the formula ε = r/(r + R) ≈ r/R, where R is the local radius of curvature
and r is the radius of the NW.9,11 The
calculated ε value was 2.7%. The strain mapping was carried
out for the [111], [011], [1̅11], and [2̅11] directions,
as indicated in the NBED. Tensile (red) and compressive (blue) strains
formed uniformly along the NW axis, with the unstrained (green) center
region. Different scale bars were used to represent properly the range
of strain for the selected direction. The strain profile (at the rectangular
region marked in the maps) shows a change from tensile to compressive
(or vice versa) strain across the diameter (see the graphs). Strain
mapping was also obtained for straight NWs, which confirmed that the
strain was formed by the bending (Supporting Information, Figure S2).

and its
corresponding strain maps of the GaP NWs with a bending strain of
(a) ε = 2.7% and (b) ε = 2%, along the [111], [011], [1̅11],
and [2̅11] directions. Strain maps of the lattice expansion
(positive value) or contraction (negative value) relative to a reference
(d0) at the center of the NW (marked by
the dots), where no lattice deformation presumably occurs, that is,
(d – d0)/d0, were taken on the individual direction. The
scale bars represent the strain range. The strain profile is for the
red line region in the strain map.

In the [111] growth direction, the tensile and compressive
strains
existed at the outer and inner regions, respectively, with 3.0 and
−2.5%. These values are close to the bending strain (ε
= 2.7%) calculated above. The tensile and compressive strains at the
edge region decrease to 2.2 and −1.2% along the [011] direction,
respectively, which was tilted 35.3° from the growth direction.
Along the [1̅11] direction, which was tilted 70.5° from
the growth direction, there was negligible strains. In the perpendicular
direction ([2̅11]), the opposite strains formed; the compressive
and tensile strains at the outer and inner regions are −0.45
and 0.6%, respectively.

For GaP NWs with ε = 2%, the HRTEM
image, NBED pattern (zone
axis = [011̅]), and the corresponding strain maps for the [111],
[011], [1̅11], and [2̅11] directions are shown in Figure 2b. The strain profile
shows a change of the strain across the diameter (see the graphs).
In the [111] growth direction, the tensile and compressive strains
at the outer and inner regions appeared with 2.2 and −1.6%,
respectively. The tensile and compressive strains decreased to 1 and
−0.5%, respectively, along the [011] direction. Along the [1̅11]
direction, the strain became almost zero. For the perpendicular direction
([2̅11]), the compressive and tensile strains existed at the
outer and inner regions, respectively, which were about −0.2
and 0.6%.

The strain mapping obtained for other GaP NWs consistently
showed
that the strain was maximized along the growth direction that it decreased
at the higher tilt directions, whereas the opposite strain appeared
along the perpendicular direction. We plotted the tensile/compressive
strain versus the orientation angle of the axis to show the dependence
of the strain on the direction of axis in the GaP NW (Figure 3a). The strains were obtained
at the same region for many axes, including [133], [311], and [100]
directions, which were tilted from the [111] growth direction by 17.6°,
27.4°, and 54.7°, respectively. The strain was almost zero
at ∼70°. The tensile strain along the perpendicular direction
was about one-fifth that along the growth direction. It was also found
that the tensile strain was always larger than the coexisting compressive
strains along all axes, which means that the bent NWs possess an excess
tensile strain.

strains
as a function of the orientation angle relative to the growth direction
([111]); (a) GaP and (b) GaAs NWs at various bending strains (ε).
The error range for each data point is marked by the lines.

We also measured the lattice-resolved
TEM images of the bent GaP
NWs and confirmed that the d-spacings at the outer
and inner regions of the NW were expanded and reduced, respectively,
as shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The lattice expansion (d111) along
the growth direction is larger than the lattice contraction, which
is consistent with the strain mapping we observed.

For the GaAs
NWs with ε = 3 and 2%, the HRTEM images, NBED
patterns at the [011̅] zone axis, and their corresponding strain
maps along the growth and perpendicular directions are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively.
The strain profile across the diameter (at the region marked by the
red line in the maps) is also shown. The results are summarized as
follows: (i) the tensile and compressive strains at the outer and
inner regions, respectively, were greatest along the growth direction,
that is, 3% tensile and −2.5% compressive strains for ε
= 3%, and 2.1% tensile and −1.9% compressive strains for ε
= 2%. (ii) Along the perpendicular direction, the compressive and
tensile strains formed at the outer and inner regions, respectively,
were −0.8 and 1.3% for ε = 3%, and −0.3 and 1.3%
for ε = 2%. (iii) The tensile strain was always larger than
the coexisting compressive strain.

Figure 4 HRTEM images, NBED patterns (zone axis
= [011̅]), and their
corresponding strain maps of the GaAs NWs with a bending strain of
(a) ε = 3% and (b) ε = 2%, along the growth direction
and its perpendicular direction. Strain maps of the lattice expansion
(positive value) or contraction (negative value) relative to a reference
(d0) at the center of the NW (marked by
the dots), where no lattice deformation presumably occurs, that is,
(d – d0)/d0, were taken on the [111] and [2̅11]
directions. The scale bars represent the strain range. The strain
profile is for the red line region in the strain map.

The strain versus axis for the GaAs NWs showed
that the strain
decreased to almost zero along axes that were tilted ∼60°
from the growth direction (see Figure 3b). Remarkably, the GaAs NWs exhibited larger strain
along the perpendicular direction as compared to the GaP NWs. The
tensile strain along the perpendicular direction was approximately
one-half that along the growth direction. Careful examination of the
strain maps along the growth direction showed that the area of the
strained region is wider for the GaAs NWs as compared to that of GaP
NWs. The line profiles of GaAs NWs consisted of a plateau edge region
(∼20 nm) with a steep crossover slope at the center (than that
of the GaP NWs) due to a narrower unstrained green region. In contrast,
the line profiles of GaP NWs showed a gradual change of the strain
over the cross section. It was also found that the GaAs NWs hold a
larger excess tensile strain than the GaP NWs.

We now compare
quantitatively the opposite strain that occurred
along the perpendicular direction for the GaP and GaAs NWs. When the
tensile strain at the outer region along the growth direction was
3%, the compressive strain formed perpendicularly as −0.45
and −0.8% for the GaP and GaAs NWs, respectively. The compressive
strain at the inner region along the growth direction was −2.5%,
whereas the tensile strain formed perpendicularly as 0.6 and 1.3%
for the GaP and GaAs NWs, respectively. Thus, the GaP NWs exhibited
two times less change of the lattice constant in the opposite direction
toward the same bending strain. These results mean that the GaP NWs
would be more rigid than the GaAs NWs. The Young’s moduli of
bulk GaP and GaAs materials were experimentally determined to be 102.8
and 85.3 GPa, respectively; the respective bulk moduli were 88.8 and
75.5 GPa, respectively, showing the larger value for GaP.41 Therefore, the higher rigidity of the GaP NWs
as compared to that of the GaAs NWs is consistent with the mechanical
modulus of the bulk phase.

Another important observation is
that the tensile strain was larger
than the coexisting compressive strain along all axes, suggesting
that the optical properties of the bent NWs may be dominated by the
tensile strain. It has been observed that the emission of bent (or
buckled) NWs red shifts due to a piezoelectric field.9−13 We predict that the band gap of the bent GaP and GaAs NWs would
decrease owing to the dominant tensile strain. Furthermore, the larger
excessive tensile strain of GaAs NWs suggests the larger band gap
decrease as compared to that of GaP NWs.

We then measured the
Raman spectra of individual GaP and GaAs NWs
having bending strains. The procedure for obtaining in-plane buckled
NWs with various bending strains (ε < 3.5%) and the use of
a micro-Raman spectrometer for measuring the Raman scattering spectrum
of individual NWs are explained in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). The strain of the bent NWs was decreased
by stretching the PDMS substrates using a mechanical micrometer stage,
and the Raman spectrum was monitored as the curvature of the NW increased.
To calculate the ε value, the curvature radii and diameters
of the bent NWs in the optical images were calibrated by tracing the
bent NW backbone in the TEM or atomic force microscopy images. The
Raman spectrum was measured at positions close to the regions with
the highest curvature and consequently at the points (green spots)
of highest strain of the NWs, as shown in the optical microscopy images
(Figure 5a). Each acquired
Raman spectrum represents the total average of the spectrum excited
from the sampled volume with a diameter of 1 μm.

Figure 5 (a) Optical images show
the strain of bent NWs (ε = 0, 1,
2, and 3%). Raman spectra of the (b) GaP and (c) GaAs NWs at various
strains. The data points were resolved into bands (colored lines)
using a Voigt function. The black line represents the sum of the resolved
TO and LO bands. The peak shift of TO modes is illustrated by the
green line. (d) Peak broadening (FWHM) of the TO mode and (e) its
peak shift as a function of bending strain (ε). Raman signals
were obtained using an Ar ion laser with a wavelength of 514.5 nm.

Figure 5b shows
the Raman spectra of the GaP NW with various bending strains. The
peaks were resolved using the Voigt function. The black line representing
the sum of the resolved bands (represented by colored lines) shows
good fit to the data points. The spectra of the straight NW (ε
= 0%) consisted of a transverse optical (TO) mode peak at 366 cm–1 and a longitudinal optical (LO) mode peak at 400
cm–1.42 There is a shoulder
peak at 360 cm–1, which is red-shifted from the
TO mode by 6 cm–1. Bakker explained its origin as
a frequency-dependent damping oscillator.43 As the bending strain increased, significant peak broadening was
observed, with a peak shift to a lower frequency region. At ε
= 0%, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the TO peak was 4.5
± 1 cm–1. As the bending strain increased to
ε = 3%, the FWHM increased to 15 ± 1 cm–1. The peak shift (Δν) was approximately −1.2 cm–1 for ε = 3%. The peak shift is illustrated by
the green line. In the case of the LO mode, it was difficult to analyze
due to the low intensity. Therefore, we focused on the change of the
TO mode peak toward the bending strain. Previous studies of the polarized
Raman spectrum showed that the peak intensity of the TO mode mainly
originated from the [111] growth direction.44 We performed polarization-dependent Raman scattering experiments
to confirm this model (see Supporting Information, Figure S5).

Figure 5c shows
the Raman spectra of the GaAs NWs, under various bending strains.
As the bending strain increased, significant peak broadening was consistently
observed. At ε = 0%, the TO and LO mode peaks at 269 and 288
cm–1, respectively, were fitted using the Voigt
function. The FWHM of the TO peak was 6 ± 1 cm–1. As the ε increased to 3%, the FWHM increased to 15 ±
1 cm–1. We also observed a red shift of approximately
−1.4 cm–1 for ε = 3%. We performed
Raman spectrum analysis for a large number of NWs and plotted the
FWHM as a function of ε, which is shown in Figure 5d. The linear fit provided
a peak broadening rate (slope) of 3.4 and 3.0 cm–1 for the GaP and GaAs NWs, respectively, showing presumably the similar
peak broadening. We plotted the peak position versus ε, which
is shown in Figure 5e; the figure shows a red shift upon increasing the strain. The linear
fit provides peak shift rates of −0.40 and −0.47 cm–1, respectively, for the GaP and GaAs NWs. To our best
knowledge, the peak shift has never been reported for the bent NWs
so far.

Previous studies on bent InP NWs reported that peak
broadening
of the Raman mode increases with increasing bending strain.36 Calculations showed that peak broadening of
the bent InP NWs resulted from both the tensile strain-induced red
shift and compressive strain-induced blue shift. The present strain
mapping visualizes clearly the coexisting tensile and compressive
strains that resulted in the broadening of the Raman peak. The similar
peak broadening of GaP and GaAs NWs is ascribed to the same maximum
tensile/compressive strains at the edge region along the growth direction.
The red shift of the Raman peaks is probably related more to the larger
tensile strain than the coexisting compressive strain that we observed
from the strain mapping. A larger red shift for the GaAs NWs may be
due to the larger excess tensile strain than that of the GaP NWs.

The Grüneisen parameter of the TO mode, which describes
the shift in the frequency of a phonon due to a variation of the lattice’s
volume as a result of pressure change, was measured to be 0.88 and
1.3, respectively, for bulk GaP and GaAs (also NWs).40,45 The value of the Grüneisen parameter predicts a larger Raman
peak shift for GaAs than that for GaP. Because the Young’s
moduli of bulk GaP and GaAs are 102.8 and 85.3 GPa, respectively,
the red shift rates were calculated to be −3.9 and −5.5
cm–1/TPa, for the GaP and GaAs NWs, respectively.
The GaAs NWs show 1.4 times larger peak shift than the GaP NWs, which
is consistent with the ratio of the Grüneisen parameters (1.5).
Therefore, the Raman spectrum of the bent NWs is correlated with the
mechanical modulus. We suggest that the peak broadening and red shift
of the Raman TO modes can be used to estimate precisely the bending
strain of both GaP and GaAs NWs.

3 Conclusions
Single-crystalline ZB phase GaP and GaAs NWs (avg. diameter = 160
nm) were synthesized with the [111] growth direction using the chemical
vapor transport method. The NBED technique was used to provide strain
maps of the bent NWs (ε = 1.5–3%) at the individual crystallographic
axis. The bent NWs exhibited the largest strain along the growth direction
with the tensile and compressive strains at the outer and inner regions,
respectively, and the value of the strain is consistent with the bending
strain (ε). The strain mapping revealed two more important results:
(i) the opposite strains existed along the perpendicular direction
([2̅11]) and (ii) the tensile strain was larger than the compressive
strain at all axes. The opposite strain was less for the GaP NWs,
which could be explained by their higher rigidity as compared to that
of the GaAs NWs.

The NWs were bent by the mechanical buckling
of PDMS, which transformed
the straight NWs into wavy shapes via the releasing of the prestrain.
The Raman spectra of individual NWs showed peak broadening and red
shifts of the TO mode under bending strains (ε = 0–3.5%).
The peak broadening rate was approximately 3 cm–1 for both GaP and GaAs NWs. Strain maps confirmed that the peak broadening
resulted from the tensile/compressive strain along the growth direction.
The red shift could be determined by the dominant tensile strain that
was revealed by the strain mapping. The Raman peak change was also
consistent with the larger mechanical modulus of GaP than that of
GaAs.

4 Experimental Details: Materials and Methods
GaAs (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) or GaP (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) powders
were placed inside a quartz tube reactor. A silicon (Si) substrate,
on which a 3 nm thick Au film was deposited, was positioned 10 cm
from the powder source. Ar gas was continuously flowed at a rate of
200 sccm during the whole growth process. H2 gas flow was
added during the NW growth, with a rate of 10 sccm. The temperature
of the powder sources was set to 1000 °C and that of the Si substrate
to 800 °C.

The structure and the composition of the products
were analyzed
by SEM (Hitachi S-4700), field emission TEM (FEI Tecnai G2, 200 kV), high-voltage TEM (JEOL JEM ARM 1300S, 1.25 MV), and energy-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. FFT images were generated by the
inversion of the TEM images using Digital Micrograph GMS1.4 software
(Gatan Inc.). A tilt holder (Dual Orientation Tomography Holder 927,
Gatan Co.) was used for the TEM measurements. High-resolution XRD
patterns were obtained using the 9B and three-dimensional beam lines
of the Pohang Light Source (PLS) with monochromatic radiation.

The strain mappings were acquired using TEM (FEI TECNAI G2 200 kV) operated at 200 keV. Both scanning and precession were enabled
through a NanoMEGAS’s Digistar system hardwired into the microscope
scan control boards. The system was controlled through the NanoMEGAS
TOPSPIN software package using a Stingray fast capture charge-coupled
device camera to capture the diffraction patterns as seen on the small
viewing screen of the microscope. The precession diffraction measurements
were based on the principle of NBED, and scanning TEM coils were used
for the precession of the electron beam. As a consequence of using
NBED, a script written in DigitalMicrograph was required to scan the
beam across the specimens and individually save the acquired patterns.
This was done using the software TOPSPIN so that the deformation maps
could be acquired using many thousands of diffraction patterns. To
measure the lattice deformation in the NW, an array of 100 ×
50 diffraction patterns was acquired using a step size of only 1.75
nm. A precession angle of 0.25° was used to provide a probe of
less than 2 nm in diameter.

For the formation of bent NWs, elastomeric
substrates of PDMS (SYLGARD
184, Dow Corning) were prepared by mixing a base resin and a curing
agent in a ratio of 10:1. The bubbles in the unset PDMS film were
removed in a vacuum chamber, and the films were cured at 70 °C
for 12 h. The PDMS films were then cut into 40 × 10 mm pieces.
The PDMS substrates were uniaxially stretched 30–100% using
a custom-made strain stage. A contact printing method applied to the
NWs as follows. The as-grown NWs on the Si substrate were rubbed onto
a receiver Si substrate (with a 50 nm thick oxide layer on the top)
under an applied load. The aligned NWs were then transferred to the
prestretched PDMS substrates by applying a uniaxial tensile force
along the axis of the NWs. Releasing the prestretched substrate induced
the compressive strain that generated the curvature of the NWs (see Supporting Information, Figure S4). To estimate
the diameter and curvature of the bent NWs, the topology measurements
were carried out using an atomic force microscopy system (XE-100 AFM,
Park Systems).

The Raman spectra of individual NWs were measured
with a home-made
micro-Raman system at room temperature. The spectral resolution is
about 1 cm–1. Raman scattering signals were obtained
in a back-scattering configuration using a 100× objective (NA
0.9) and an Ar ion laser with a wavelength of 514.5 nm. The laser
spot size was approximately 1 μm, which, in combination with
the imaging capabilities of the microscope, allowed for routine single-wire
identification. A laser power below 0.5 mW was used to avoid heating
effects. We used a mechanical stage to stretch the NW-embedded PDMS
substrates and release the strains of the wavy NWs in a controlled
way using a micrometer.
