Wood represents a highly suitable
biobased scaffold for the development
of mechanically robust and functional materials. Its functionalizability
can be enhanced by means of delignification, resulting in an increase
in porosity due to partial or complete removal of lignin and hemicellulose
constituents. In this work, the impact of partial and complete delignification
on the mesoporous structure is investigated via water vapor sorption
isotherms and deuterium exchange. Pore size distributions of wood
samples with five different delignification levels were compared to
native wood. The derived pore size distributions at the water swollen
state reveal an increase in porosity with decreasing lignin content.
However, after complete lignin removal, drying causes a nonreversible
collapse of the cell wall, which results in reduced porosity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Delignification
of wood is a common industrial process, which was
recently re-suggested for innovative wood-based material developments.1−9 Hereby, the wood inherent cellulose scaffold is maintained, while
part of the matrix components such as lignin and hemicelluloses are
removed. These scaffolds can be functionalized10,11 or infiltrated with various matrix systems12−14 in both, dry
and wet state. The investigation of cell wall porosity in the entire
moisture content range is of high interest, as it determines the functionalizability.

Pore size distributions (PSDs) have been measured using various
techniques.15 Mercury intrusion porosimetry
is widely used to measure PSDs in the macroporous range (>50 nm
width).
However, the technique is unsuited to characterize smaller pores within
the cell wall.16,17 Thermoporometry by differential
scanning calorimetry is an alternative but needs to be conducted at
a low temperature (−70 °C) in order to obtain a resolution
in the nanometer range.18 A more precise
characterization of micropores (0–2 nm width) and mesopores
(2–50 nm width) is provided by the use of gas adsorption isotherms.
Nevertheless, the material is characterized in the dry state only
and traditional N2 adsorption needs to be conducted at
a low temperature (<−196 °C), which potentially affects
the material’s microstructure. The characterization of pores
by gas adsorption is very specific to the adsorbate molecule (e.g.,
its size, polarity), and its interaction with the adsorbent’s
surface. Therefore, derived values such as specific surface area or
porosity need to be interpreted accordingly.

In the case of
wood, the described methods do not capture swelling
of the lignocellulosic polymers in the wood cell wall, which heavily
impacts porosity. A suitable way of addressing this limitation is
to characterize the pores of the wood cell wall at room temperature
by water vapor sorption isotherms. The small and polar water molecule
is able to penetrate narrow voids and is uniquely able to swell the
wood cell wall. In contrast to traditional gas adsorption techniques,
water vapor adsorption provides a structural analysis over the entire
moisture content range by adsorption and subsequent desorption reaching
a maximum partial pressure (p/p0) of 0.98. Additionally, the fully swollen state can be depicted
when starting with desorption from the water-saturated state (p/p0 = 1). Water adsorption
studies characterizing delignified wood or other natural cellulosic
fibers are still relatively sparse,19−24 and porosity changes upon delignification have not yet been investigated
with this technique.

In this study, water affinity and cell
wall porosity of native,
partially, and totally delignified wood (Norway spruce) are characterized
by means of water vapor sorption isotherms. PSDs are derived from
isotherms starting at the dry and at the water-saturated state. The
measurements are complemented by heavy-water deuteration experiments,
which represent an additional way to characterize water vapor interaction.25−29 Deuteration of the material provides the number of available OH
groups, which is an important factor for functionalization treatments.

2 Theory
2.1 Assumptions on the Determination of the PSD
The Norway spruce earlywood cell wall is approximately composed
of 48% cellulose and 52% matrix material (21% hemicelluloses and 31%
lignin).30 Cellulose chains form microfibrils
of 2.5–3 nm in diameter, which means that only the OH groups
on the surface of the microfibrils are accessible for water. Multiple
microfibrils are arranged in bundles to form macrofibrils, which are
embedded in the matrix material.31−34 By the current understanding,
water molecules spontaneously and randomly adsorb on local sorption
sites by forming hydrogen bonds with available OH groups of the polymers.
The binding energy of this type of localized adsorption (26 kJ mol–1)35 lies in between physisorption
(van der Waals interactions, <4 kJ mol–1) and
chemisorption (dissociative interactions, >50 kJ mol–1). It can be expected that by increasing the partial pressure (p/p0), the locally available
sites get occupied and capillary condensation takes place in larger
voids or pores within the cell wall or middle lamella, predominantly
in the mesopore range and above.36 However,
water sorption mechanisms of wood or lignocellulosic materials are
still largely unknown and are subject of current research and discussion.37−39

Hereafter, the common interpretation of a type IV IUPAC isotherm
is assumed in order to derive the PSD from water sorption data. First,
a multilayer physisorption mechanism at lower p/p0 followed by a capillary condensation mechanism
in mesopores is presumed. For simplicity, it is also assumed that
the material possesses cylindrically shaped pores of radius r and both, film volume and condensed volume simultaneously
fill the pores. A model-less method to obtain properties of the first
physisorption-alike mechanism is to consider the change in Gibbs free
energy by adsorption (ΔGa). This
value represents a change in surface energy, which characterizes the
exothermic spontaneity of an adsorption process.40 It has already been used to analyze water adsorption on
lignocellulosic materials.41−43 The interpretation of full water
coverage, or an equivalent monolayer, at the maximum energetic adsorbate–adsorbent
interaction state is often applied to materials such as porous silica,44 and PSDs derived from water adsorption were
validated against PSDs from N2 adsorption.45 The maximum interaction capacity is used to correct the
pore radius by assuming a water film thickness on the inner pore walls.
However, in lignocellulosic materials, an existence of an equivalent
monolayer capacity remains speculative.

2.2 Calculation
of the PSD
2.2.1 Adsorbed Film
In an adsorbent–adsorbate
system, where na particles of the adsorbate
are added as an ideal solution with chemical potential μ at
partial pressure p/p0, the change in Gibbs free energy of adsorption is defined as  where R represents the molar
gas constant and T is the temperature. A plot of
ΔGa versus na is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1) for the samples that are investigated in this study.
At a certain amount ncΔG, the exothermic
process of adsorption is characterized by a maximum adsorbent–adsorbate
energetic interaction. This amount can be calculated from analytical
isotherm curves by using the condition  

Calculated values of ncΔG for the investigated samples are compared in the Supporting Information S2 to values obtained
when applying the more widespread but often criticized Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) theory. At each amount na, a theoretical
film thickness on the inner pore walls can now be calculated as  where τ is the thickness
of a single
layer of adsorbate (τH2O = 0.24 nm).

2.2.2 Capillary Condensation
By assuming
capillary condensation (in adsorption) and evaporation (in desorption)
in cylindrical pores and under the assumption that the work against
interfacial tension is equal to ΔGa, the Kelvin radius is defined as  where
γ is the surface tension (γH2O,25°C = 0.07197 N m –1), Vm is the molar volume, and ϑ
is the wetting angle. It is assumed here that γ does not change
in dependence of r and cos ϑ = 1 (complete
wetting of a plane solid surface).

2.2.3 Pore
Volume Distribution
The pore
radius as a function of na and p/p0 can be obtained by adding
the Kelvin radius to the film thickness as r = rK + t, and the adsorbed volume
of water can be calculated from an experimental isotherm with  

The density of condensed water ρ
is assumed here to be equal to the liquid density (ρH2O = 1 g cm –3), and the molar mass
is MH2O = VmρH2O = 18.01528 g mol –1. The PSD, or pore volume distribution (fV), follows by solving the generalized adsorption equation45,46  VM represents
a dimensionless model isotherm for pore filling according to the specific
assumptions made on the pore shape. An approximate analytical formulation47 for the PSD can be given by the expression  for cylindrical pores of
radius r. The term dVadr–1 can be calculated by numerical
differentiation from
fitted Va(na) versus r(na, p/p0) curves.

It has to
be noted that the mesopore range (2 < 2r <
50 nm) approximately corresponds to the partial water vapor
pressure range of 0.4 < p/p0 < 0.95 as shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). This range, based on the current
understanding of sorption mechanisms, reasonably represents and limits
the validity of the derived PSD for lignocellulosic materials. Below,
the sorption mechanism remains uncertain, and above, the exact experimental
generation of water vapor p/p0 becomes questionable.

3 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the sorption kinetics of native (NAT), partially (D15-D120), and fully
delignified wood (D360). Fully delignified wood and D120 exhibit the
fastest sorption behavior, while native wood shows the slowest sorption
behavior.
The partially delignified samples D15, D30, and D60 show a slightly
faster sorption behavior than NAT while being significantly slower
than D120 and D360. The most distinct changes in sample sorption kinetics
are seen after 15 min and between 60 and 120 min of delignification.
As the sorption kinetics in the cell wall is influenced by diffusion
processes through pores of different sizes, the change in sorption
kinetics can be explained by a structural change that is affecting
the diffusion path. After partial delignification, a certain amount
of matrix remains to support a porous scaffold structure, while the
removed material builds the pore space. Additionally, changes in structure
on the tissue scale (e.g., the removal of the middle lamella between
wood cells) could equally influence sorption kinetics.

The adsorption isotherm in terms
of adsorbed number of molecules
(na), obtained by plotting the sorption
equilibrium points from Figure 1a, is shown in Figure 1b. By comparing the NAT and D360 curves, it can be seen that
a larger water amount is adsorbed on the NAT sample until p/p0 = 0.98. Samples D15, D30,
and D60 adsorb more water than native wood, while D120 adsorbs the
same amount until p/p0 = 0.85. As above, more water is adsorbed by the D120 sample. Partial
delignification up to 60 min seems to expose more sorption sites and
creates pore space for increased adsorption. However, after 120 min
of delignification, the adsorption capacity decreases, and the fully
delignified sample shows the lowest adsorption capacity over the whole p/p0 range. A possible explanation
for this behavior is a collapse of the delignified wood cell wall
after drying due to the absence of a supporting matrix. Scanning desorption
curves and the hysteresis are shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S1). For lignocellulosic materials,
the meaning and interpretation of the scanning desorption isotherm,
especially the hysteresis effect, is currently the subject of debate.48−51 For this reason, PSDs derived from the adsorption curves are discussed
in the following.

From the amount of water volume (Va) that can be incorporated in the scaffold of the cell
wall (Figure 1c), it
is visible
that partial delignification creates an increase in porosity compared
to native wood. The adsorbed water volume is significantly higher
after condensation in pores with a larger radius than 10 nm. The number
of pores present after water adsorption (i.e., the PSD curves) is
shown in Figure 1d.
According to the curves, the majority of the pores of all samples
are below a radius of 2 nm, while a smaller number possess radii up
to 50 nm. The amount of pores between 2 and 20 nm is responsible for
the major water volume adsorption (Figure 1c), and samples D15 to D120 possess a larger
amount of such pores in comparison to the NAT and D360 samples.

To verify the hypothesized collapse of delignified wood upon drying,
we additionally investigated the never-dried state of native and fully
delignified wood by measuring true desorption isotherms,52 starting from the fully water-saturated state.
Fully delignified wood shows a higher water content above p/p0 = 0.9 compared to native
wood, which can be seen in Figure 2a. Upon reducing the partial pressure, the water content
in delignified wood is decreased more abruptly compared to native
wood, resulting in an intercept point of the curves at p/p0 = 0.9, which indicates a collapse.
Furthermore, at lower p/p0, delignified wood shows a lower water content than native wood,
as observed already in the adsorption isotherms in Figure 1b. The derived PSDs from the
saturated desorption, which are shown in Figure 2c and Figure S4.2, further support the hypothesis. The difference in porosity of the
water-saturated state compared to the dry state is significantly more
pronounced for delignified wood than for native wood. Compared to
native wood, a larger amount of mesopores is present in the water-saturated
delignified sample. Such an open porosity in the wet state could be
beneficial when it comes to functionalization of the cellulose scaffold,
as the higher permeability eases the in situ formation of, for example,
polymers or minerals.

adsorbed water volume (Va) in theoretical
pores of cylinder radius r from true desorption curves

2–50 nm.

As mentioned before,
the PSD curves can only be interpreted in
the mesopore range, where capillary condensation is assumed to be
far more relevant than localized adsorption. The supposedly nonporous
structure below a pore width of 2 nm can be assessed by techniques
revealing the number of sorption sites. In theory, these are equivalent
to the available amount of hydroxyl groups. Figure 3 displays the total number of available OH
groups obtained by sample deuteration using heavy water. Partially
delignified wood shows values in between 10 and 10.5 mmol g –1, while native wood shows a lower accessibility between 8.5 and 9
mmol g –1, which is in agreement with literature
values.28,29 These changes can be either attributed to
structural or chemical changes upon delignifification or a combination
thereof. Lignin, hemicelluloses, and cellulose possess different amounts
of OH groups. Thus, the matrix material removal cannot be exclusively
correlated with structural changes in terms of OH accessibility. Furthermore,
the cellulose crystallinity may have been affected by delignification,53 which could further influence the OH accessibility.
In addition, it remains unclear whether the amount of measured accessible
hydroxyls can be correlated with the amount of water adsorbed. If
this was the case, only the amount of water adsorbed above p/p0 = 0.9 (at na = naOH) could be attributed to capillary condensation,
which would be physically untrue given the material is porous (Figure S1). This suggests that the amount of
deuterated OH groups is higher than the amount of local sorption sites
interacting with water.

Studies of porosity of the dried
native and delignified wood cell
wall using N2 and CO2 adsorption have been conducted
in previous studies.54−56 An increase in porosity upon delignification is reported
by Fu et al.10 In addition, the structural
collapse at the dry state and the open porous system for the water-saturated
fully delignified state, as measured for wood in this study, was also
reported for pulp7,57 and by means of different characterization
techniques. N2 adsorption measurements on wood-derived
pulp fibers reveal a collapsed porous structure after drying,58,59 and by using solvent exchange, the open porous structure was preserved.24,60 The specific surface area found by water vapor adsorption in the
present study is compared to literature values in Table S1, in accordance with the results.

The water
vapor adsorption data and its processing proved useful
for quantitative and qualitative characterization of the structural
changes upon delignification of the wood cell wall. The proposed model
for derivation of PSDs from water adsorption data builds on multiple
assumptions and omits some material-inherent aspects such as the influence
of swelling on the pore shape or the 3D complexity of the pore structure
in the wood cell wall. However, a significant key advantage is that
the material’s structure can be revealed and characterized
at the water swollen state. This state is of particular relevance
for modification and functionalization treatments of lignocellulosic
materials for various material applications.

4 Conclusions
Stepwise delignification of the wood cell wall highly affected
its structure in terms of porosity. An increase in porosity is reported
with higher delignification times by derivation of PSDs from water
adsorption data. At full delignification, the pore system collapses
upon drying, and porosity is reduced as cellulose fibrils supposedly
get more closely packed than in the native state. However, at a water-saturated
state, the fully delignified samples possess a highly mesoporous structure,
which was demonstrated by deriving PSDs from true desorption isotherms.
This can be utilized to optimize modifications at the cell wall level
(e.g., by chemical functionalization) to achieve new emerging cellulose-based
materials.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Delignification
Norway spruce (Picea abies) cubes
(5 × 5 × 5 mm3) consisting exclusively of earlywood
were prepared. The wood samples
were delignified by using an equal volume mixture of hydrogen peroxide
solution (35 wt %, Acros Organics) and glacial acetic acid (Fisher
Chemicals) as described in Frey et al. 2018 and Segmehl et al. 2018.2,61 The samples were wrapped in a metal grid to prevent disintegration
during the delignification treatment and placed into a beaker on top
of a metal grid holder. The samples were soaked in the HAc/H2O2 mixture overnight under constant stirring (150 rpm).
Then, delignification was conducted at 80 °C for 15, 30, 60,
120, and 360 min, resulting in partially delignified samples D15,
D30, D60, and D120 as well as fully delignified sample D360. The degree
of delignification was measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(Supporting Information S3).

5.2 Sorption Isotherms
Dynamic water
vapor adsorption and scanning desorption were measured on native (denoted
NAT) and delignified wood samples by an automated sorption balance
device (DVS Advantage ET85, Surface Measurment Systems Ltd.). Measurements
were conducted according to material-specific recommendations for
good practice.62 Samples were cut into
fine stripes. Ten milligrams of the stripes (65% relative humidity,
20 °C) were then dried for 6 h at 60 °C and at a partial
water vapor pressure of p/p0 = 0. The samples were then exposed to ascending p/p0 steps of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20,
0.25, 0.30, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95, and 0.98 for adsorption
and then descending in the same manner for desorption at 25 °C.
Equilibrium in each step was defined to be reached at a mass change
per time (dm/dt) of less than 0.0005%/min
over a 10 min window or a maximal time of 1000 min per step. The samples
were exposed to a flow rate of 200 sccm, and the carrier gas used
was N2 of grade 5.0. Additionally, true desorption isotherms
for samples NAT and D360 were measured starting in the water-saturated
state following Fredriksson and Thybring 2018.52

The amount adsorbed na, in units of mmol adsorbate per gram of adsorbent, is derived from
recorded raw data, that is, mass change dm, with na = dm(mrefMH2O)−1. Analytical isotherm curves (na = f(p/p0)) were
obtained by piecewise polynomial smoothing splines with a perfect
goodness of fit to the data points (R2 = 1).

5.3 Hydroxyl Accessibility
The samples
were prepared in the same manner as the sorption isotherm measurements,
and the same drying procedure was applied to obtain the reference
mass (dry mass) mref. The samples were
then exposed to D2O vapor at p/p0 = 0.95 and 25 °C for 9 h. Then, the drying
routine was applied again, and the deuterated dry mass mD, ref was obtained. ROH + D2O ⇌
⇌ ROD + HDO represents the dynamic exchange reaction where
the biopolymer is represented by the term ROH (ROD in the deuterated
state). To avoid deprotonation during the second drying, N2 of grade 6.0 (traces of H2O < 0.5 ppm) was used as
the carrier gas. The number of available OH groups was calculated
as  where MD and MH are molar
masses.
