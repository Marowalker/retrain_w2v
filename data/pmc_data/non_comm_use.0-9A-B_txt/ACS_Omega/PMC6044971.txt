This article reports a novel fabrication
of branched cum cross-linked
poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with nanosilk fibroin with graft chain topology
by reactive extrusion process. It could be possible by the addition
of a small amount of radical initiator (dicumyl peroxide (DCP)). Grafting
of silk nanocrystals (SNCs) on PLA macromolecules that provides remarkable
improvement in the rheological and thermal properties of the latter
are confirmed by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared
investigation. Significant improvement is observed in zero shear viscosities,
and the crossover point shifts to lower frequencies as compared to
the branched and cross-linked PLA system. Along with SNC grafting,
the crystallization process is also enhanced and stable crystals appeared
during cooling, which results in a single melting peak. The rate of
crystallization of PLA has been improved although the percentage crystallinity
reduces with DCP content, as higher grafting and cross-linking restricts
the chain segmental motion, which is critical for crystallization
process. Furthermore, SNC grafting increases the reprocessability
performance of PLA and provides higher rheological properties as compared
to the branched and cross-linked PLA at all reprocessing cycles.

1 Introduction
Petroleum-based
polymers have served as an essential material for
betterment of humans’ lifestyle but with a lot of undeniable
limitations to the environment.1,2 Due to the concern of
waste disposal and depletion of world oil resources, the interest
of substituting conventional polymers with sustainable and biodegradable
polymers has been the central part of research for the last two decades.3−7 In this prospect, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is the leading biodegradable
aliphatic polyester, which has emerged as an attractive industrial
scale processable thermoplastic polymer with comparable mechanical
properties to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polystyrene (PS).6,8−10 However, because of its poor melt strength, it is
difficult to process it for blown film and foaming to produce confectionary
commodity articles with degradable characteristics. Furthermore, the
application span is limited because of its high brittleness, poor
barrier properties, and low heat distortion temperature.11,12

It is well known that processing of PLA with fillers (organic
or
inorganic) and plasticizers and by blending with toughened polymers
can enhance its barrier and mechanical properties.5,13 Controlled polymerization of PLA
with a mixture of l- and d-lactic acid or lactide
leads to the formation of a stereocomplex, which in turn increased
the heat distortion and melting temperatures to approximately 120–140
and 220–240 °C, respectively.14−16 PLA undergoes thermal degradation at high temperature and shear,
which results in its low melt strength. Investigation of the macromolecular
chain modification of PLA is a bit complex process due to the existence
of different simultaneous reactions. Random chain scission, which
is known to be a major cause of thermal degradation within the processing
window of PLA (180–220 °C), is the reason for the drastic
reduction in molecular weight.17−19 In addition to this, the reduction
in molecular weight becomes more critical when trace amounts of water
molecules, short oligomeric chains, residual catalysts, and monomeric
units are present in the polymer matrix.

Reactive extrusion
in the presence of multifunctional epoxy, highly
reactive peroxides, such as dicumyl peroxide (DCP) and bezolperoxide,
has been practiced to enhance the melt strength of polypropylene,
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(butylene terephthalate),
and the likes.20−23 Similar techniques have been adapted to improve the melt strength
of PLA, which leads to enhancing the processing performance and other
physical properties (mechanical, barrier, and thermal properties).24 Zhou et al. successfully prepared a chain-extended
PLA–epoxy resin copolymer through reactive extrusion using
diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A as a chain extender.25 Cailloux et al. also showed a one-step reactive calendering
process to improve the thermal sensitivity of PLA with styrene acrylic
multifunctional oligomer, which leads to improvement in melt rheology
due to the predominance of long-chain branching.26 A significant macromolecular modification of PLA/poly(butylene
adipate-co-terephtalate) blend at various proportions
is observed due to reactive extrusion in the presence of Joncryl (glycidyl
methacrylate), which further increases the mechanical and rheological
properties.27 Radical initiator dicumyl
peroxide (DCP) is also an effective chain extender, which is proven
to initiate the grafting of PLA chains on the surface of cellulose
nanocrystals, resulting in an improvement in melt strength and mechanical
properties (Young’s modulus by ∼40% and tensile strength
by ∼490%) with improved recycling performance.28,29 The same kind of result was also reported by Bian et al., in which
the tensile strength and modulus of the poly(lactic acid)/poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) blend significantly increased with
the addition of DCP.30

From our previous
investigation, thermally stable silk nanocrystals
(SNCs) are observed to stabilize the thermal properties of PLA even
under repetitive extrusion.12 The hydrophobicity
of SNCs along with their highly structured β-sheet network (arising
because of strong hydrogen bonding between C=O and N–H
groups) helps to reinforce the PLA matrix with good dispersion. The
crystalline part of silk fibroin is proved to have amino acids repeating
order of glycine–alanine–glycine–alanine–glycine–serine. Similar to cellulose, serine group
of SNCs contains −CH2–, which is ideal for
the formation of radicals using radical initiators for grafting of
PLA chains, which may help to modify the matrix during reactive extrusion.
If this approach is successful, then it may increase the performance
of SNCs remarkably as a filler and may enhance the melt strength,
which is the major drawback of PLA.

To have better understanding
of the macromolecular level, proper
characterization techniques and analysis procedures need to be followed.
In PLA-reactive extrusion process, degradation and chain coupling
occur simultaneously and the chain modification undergoes through
long- and short-chain branching, cross-linking, and grafting on the
surface of fillers. Estimation of the gel content and the molecular
weight analysis of the system can provide general information about
the chain modification, and it needs to be supported by rheological
investigations, which is a powerful tool to have a clear understanding
about the changes occurring at the macromolecular level.28,31 Zero shear viscosity, storage and loss modulus characteristics at
terminal region, and crossover frequency can be used to quantify the
macromolecular chain modification. Furthermore, the weight relaxation
spectrum (λH(λ)) can verify different
microstructural topologies, such as chain branching and cross-linking.13,26 Along with melt rheology, changes in the thermal stability (melting
and crystallization properties and thermal decomposition behavior)
of the sample also need to be investigated.

The present study
deals with the reactive modification of PLA/SNC
nanocomposite with dicumyl peroxide (DCP) and relates the impact of
chain modification to the melt rheology, crystallization properties,
and thermal stabilities. The structural change and possible reaction
mechanisms are also assessed with the help of gel permeation chromatography
(GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy studies. Additionally, the impact of reprocessing
on the above-mentioned important properties is discussed in subsequent
sections.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Impact
of DCP on the Structural Modification
of PLA/Silk Bionanocomposite
It is already discussed in various
literature works that DCP decomposes into free radicals at high temperature
with strong ability to abstract hydrogen and initiates radicals on
PLA backbone, which is the result of propagation of cross-linking
reaction between the PLA chains.32 This
reaction takes place in extruder when subjected to high shear and
temperature, which provides sufficient mixing that leads to the modification
of chain topology by cross-linking or branching (long- and/or short-chain
branching). This phenomenon is totally different when fillers are
incorporated into the reactive extrusion system because the radical
initiator can get the chance to abstract hydrogen from the weak sites
of the filler’s bond linkage.28 Gel
percentage, which is estimated (samples collected at a residence time
of 5 min) using eq 1 (dividing
the weight of dry gel (Wgel) by the sample
weight before washing (Wi) it with chloroform
to remove unmodified macromolecules), has been used as a primary analysis
to understand the reactive modification of PLA. Due to the weak interaction
of the cross-linked portion of the polymeric system with solvent,
the probability of the formation of a gel-like structure is high. 1  Two possible modifications are expected during
reactive extrusion of the current system: PLA–PLA (cross-linking
and branching) and PLA–SNC (grafting). Reactive extrusion of
neat PLA (NPLA) is used as a reference system to assess the impact
of SNC on PLA chain modification. As indicated in Table 1, for reactive extrusion of
NPLA at 1 and 1.5 wt % DCP loading, gel percentages of ∼10
and ∼30% are observed, which indicates the presence of cross-linking
topology. However, at lower DCP loading (0.5 wt %), no gel formation
is observed. Similar observation is also reported for poly(3-hydoxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate), in which no gel formation was observed
at DCP content less than 0.5 wt %.33 However,
the gel percentage of SNC–PLA increases from 10% (0.5 wt %
DCP) to 60% (1.5 wt % DCP). This result confirms that, apart from
the polymer-to-polymer cross-linking interaction, which leads to the
long-chain branching, there is also a significant interaction between
SNC and PLA macromolecules. This result gave the fundamental information
to predict the formation of radicals on the SNC macromolecular structure
(possible on serine group of −CH2OH, which will
be explained by 1H NMR analysis) that promotes grafting
on PLA backbone chains. As indicated in Table 1, specific rotation and optical rotation
of reactively extruded samples decrease with increasing weight percentage
of DCP. This may be attributed to the hindrance of the specific rotation
due to branching of long chains attached to the central chiral carbon
of PLA. Incorporation of SNC slightly lowers the specific rotation as compared to NPLA,
which is due to the additional effect of grafting on the chiral carbon.28

Macromolecular structural modification after reactive extrusion
is also confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, as described in Figure 1. Neat poly(lactic acid) (NPLA)
shows main characteristic peaks at 2854, 2925, 1382, and 1455 cm–1 attributed to symmetric and asymmetric stretching
and symmetric and asymmetric bending of CH3, respectively;
2996 and 1358 cm–1 due to C–H stretching
and deformation vibration, respectively; 1076 and 1180 cm–1 due to symmetric and asymmetric valance vibration of C–O–C,
respectively; transmission bands at 867 and 753 cm–1 due to C–C stretching; and 1747 cm–1 due
to the C=O stretching band. The intensity of the peak ranging
from 1230 to 1000 cm–1 attributed to the C–O–C
and C–H deformation peak at 1358 cm–1 decreases
with DCP in case of NPLA. However, it further diminishes for modified
SNC–PLA. It is an indication of chain modification due to branching
and cross-linking through the formation of a new C–C bond (observed
at 799 cm–1) on the backbone of PLA, which affects
the intensity of the ester linkage. The significant impact of SNC
observed on the ester linkage intensity may also be due to the grafting.

samples using FTIR spectra in (a) full range, (b) 3010–2700
cm–1, (c) 1890–1280 cm–1, and (d) 1280–650 cm–1.

A new peak is observed at 2960 cm–1 for reactively
modified samples, and peaks at 2854 cm–1 (symmetric
stretching CH3) and 2925 cm–1 (asymmetric
stretching CH3) are shifted to 2851 and 2920 cm–1, respectively. Due to high branching, the backbone C–C bond-stretching
(753 cm–1) band intensity is decreased with increasing
DCP weight loading. Due to high branching and cross-linking, van der
Waals interaction arises between the C=O and hydrogens of CH3 groups of the branched chains and a shoulder-like peak is
identified at 1710 cm–1. The disappearance of transition peak at 2996 cm–1, which corresponds to C–H stretching, and the diminishing
of C–H vibration deformation peak at 1361 cm–1 support radical-initiated abstraction of hydrogen, which leads to
chain modification possibly by cross-linking, branching, and grafting.
NMR investigation of reactively modified SNC–PLA system can
provide insight into the grafting of SNC on PLA chain.

1H NMR analyses are performed for NPLA and SNC–PLA
at 1 wt % DCP to study the possibility of grafting. As indicated in Figure 2, new characteristic
peaks are observed for SNC–PLA system in the ranges of 4.10–4.15
ppm (marked as “a”) and 2.0–2.5 ppm (marked as
“b”), which were missing in reactively modified NPLA
samples (1H NMR spectra in Figure S1), which may be attributed to the methine proton formed due to the
grafting of PLA chains on the serine −CH2OH group
of SNC. As already discussed above, DCP forms radicals at high temperature
and shear, which have a strong tendency to abstract hydrogen and form
radicals on PLA backbone and the serine (−CH2OH)
group of silk fibroin, which is the reason for the initiation of grafting
of PLA chains on the silk macromolecular structure. On the basis of
the results obtained from gel percentage, FTIR, and NMR analyses,
the reaction mechanism for the reactive modification can be summarized
as shown in reaction Scheme 1.

grafting and “b” represents the presence of silk structure

Scheme 1 Summarized Reaction Pathway for the
Modification of SNC–PLA
Chain Topology by Cross-Linking and Grafting through Reactive Extrusion
Process
The significant change
observed in the chemical structure due to
grafting is further addressed by the molecular weight analysis using
GPC. Furthermore, the molar mass distribution (Mn, Mw, and polydispersity index
(PDI)) is used to monitor the reaction progress and modification efficiency
of reactively extruded SNC–PLA at various compositions of DCP
(0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt %). As compared to PLA granules (GPLA), molecular
weight of extruded PLA (NPLA) is reduced (22% in Mw and 36% in Mn) due to thermomechanical
degradation at processing time of 5 min with polydispersity index
(PDI) of 2.6. The addition of SNC leads to the formation of lower-molecular-weight
fraction (14% area) and 86% area representing higher-molar-mass fraction
with 8 and 10% increment in Mn and Mw, respectively, as compared to NPLA. In this
study, reactively extruded samples are collected at residence times
of ∼3 and ∼5 min for molecular weight analysis. Figure 3 shows the molecular
weight distribution curve of SNC–PLA (at all DCP wt %) for
residence times of ∼3 and ∼5 min. Interestingly, the
percentage area for large macromolecules of reactively extruded SNC–PLA
samples is observed to increase from 48% (0.5DCP–SNC–PLA)
to 90% (1DCP–SNC–PLA) and 100% (1.5DCP–SNC–PLA)
with 108, 96, and 133 kDa of Mn and 295,
317, and 267 kDa of Mw, respectively,
at residence time of ∼3 min (Figure 3a). It indicates that sufficient amount of
radicals are generated (at 1.5 wt % of DCP) to give higher molecular
weight with shorter residence time, which is in agreement with the
lifetime of DCP radicals (190 s), which is reported by Takamura et
al.32 As the residence time increased to
5 min, the molecular weight drastically reduced with increasing DCP
composition. However, the lower-molecular-weight fraction observed
at residence time of 3 min is merged with the higher-molecular-weight
fraction, as indicated in Figure 3c. From Figure 3b,d it can be clearly observed that the new broad peak appears
in the higher-molecular-weight population side because of cross-linking
and grafting. Due to the fact that the hydrodynamic volume is highly
affected by the molecular chain topology, estimation of molecular
weight distribution using GPC alone may not be a suitable technique.
Additionally, it is difficult to conclude about the change in chain
topology only using the results obtained from GPC. Rheological investigation
can provide deep insight into change related to long-chain branching,
cross-linking, and grafting, which are already confirmed by spectroscopy
techniques.

2.2 Rheological
Characteristics of Reactively
Modified Neat and PLA/SNC Nanocomposites
The influence of
grafting on viscoelastic shear dependency and relaxation spectra are
assessed using dynamic rheological measurement performed at 190 °C
in the frequency range of 0.1–500 rad/s within the viscoelastic
region (5% strain is taken on the basis of the small-amplitude strain
sweep analysis). The frequency (ω) dependency of complex viscosity
(η*) is displayed in Figure 4 for all DCP-modified samples in comparison to NPLA
and SNC–PLA samples extruded under the same conditions without
DCP. It is clearly observed that the NPLA, SNC–PLA, and 0.5DCP–NPLA
samples exhibited the same trend with the Newtonian behavior up to
10 rad/s. The 0.5DCP–NPLA sample shows higher viscosity due
to the observed increment in molecular weight. With increasing the
DCP amount, the Newtonian behavior shifts to lower-frequency region,
and significant increment in viscosity and shear-thinning behavior
are observed for both reactively extruded NPLA and SNC–PLA.

Figure 4 Effect
of macromolecular chain modification on the change of complex
viscosity with respect to frequency and the impact of SNC grafting
on the change in viscosity at 0.1 rad/s frequency.

This pronounced improvement on the rheological
characteristic can
be related to long-chain branching and cross-linking. As observed
from the gel percentage and 1H NMR spectroscopy studies,
the incorporation of SNC into PLA matrix gives additional reinforcement,
which leads to increase in the melt strength. More interestingly,
complex viscosity of SNC–PLA at the frequency of 0.1 rad/s
was observed to be higher than that of NPLA by 273, 3155, 10 875,
and 12871 Pa s at DCP amounts of 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt %, respectively.
This result gives a strong evidence of SNC grafting on PLA backbone
with the formation of long-chain branching and cross-linking, which
restrict the mobility of macromolecules by forming more entangled
networks.

Figure 5 displays
the frequency dependency of storage modulus (G′)
of all analyzed samples and the increment observed at lower frequency
(0.1 rad/s), which is probably due to grafting of SNC. The result
related to the loss modulus is shown in Figure S2, from which it is clear that the storage modulus exhibits
more plateau-like behavior at lower-frequency region with increasing
weight percentage of DCP. Similarly to the complex viscosity, the
storage modulus value of SNC–PLA increased by 3.8, 109, 789,
and 1265 Pa as compared to the NPLA system at the respective DCP amounts
of 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt %, which further supports the grafting phenomenon
that increases the solidlike behavior of the matrix. The percolation
effect of SNC is also enhanced because of grafting and provides a
thermally stable entangled network, which increases the dominance
of storage modulus over loss modulus.

Figure 5 Effect of angular frequency and DCP content
on the storage and
loss moduli of NPLA and SNC–PLA.

Reactive extrusion-induced macromolecular chain modification
can
be further explained by using the crossover frequencies of storage
and loss moduli, terminal region properties (slope, storage and loss
moduli), and the slope of storage versus loss modulus graph (Han plot).
As already discussed in the literature, this transition point is strongly
affected by the macromolecular topology of polymer melt. The presence
of long-chain branching, linear chain extension, and cross-linking
or any kind of network formation (network formation due to grafting)
provides the ability to absorb energy and relax slowly at higher relaxation
time. As illustrated in Table 2, it can be noted that the crossover frequencies decrease
with increasing DCP wt % for both NPLA and SNC–PLA. Reactive
extrusion in the presence of SNC lowers the crossover frequency values
from 123 to 116, 119 to 58, 21 to 1.4, and 0.11 to <0.1 Hz (NPLA
to SNC–PLA, respectively) against DCP amounts of 0, 0.5, 1,
and 1.5 wt %.

The impact of SNC grafting
can be easily observed from the significant
reduction of crossover points that define the transition of solidlike
behavior of the melt to the liquidlike behavior. This improvement
is more pronouncing at higher DCP loading, and it is due to the increment
in the degree of grafting or grafting efficiency with DCP content.
Similar conclusion can also be drawn from the complex viscosity values
extracted at the crossover points, which shows drastic increase with
increasing DCP loading and grafting of SNC.

Interestingly, no
change in storage and loss modulus values is
observed at higher frequencies, which indicates the short-range dynamics
of the polymeric melt, and hence are not affected by the chain modifications.
However, at low frequencies, both properties decrease monotonically,
and the terminal characteristics are observed to deviate from the
regular linear polymer power law relationship of G′(ω) α ω2 and G″(ω) α ω for both reactively modified NPLA
and SNC–PLA. It has been found that for polymeric melts in
which the solidlike behavior is becoming more and more predominant,
the G′ and G″ modulus
dependency on power law at lower frequencies will significantly diminish
from 1 and 2 to lower values, respectively. Reactive modification
of PLA in the presence of DCP, which can form active radicals, will
lead to the formation of a more networked melt having solidlike behavior,
which can be related to the polymer-to-polymer interaction due to
long-chain branching and cross-linking. We note in Table 2 that the terminal region G′ and G″ dependency on frequencies
further diminishes in the presence of SNCs as compared to NPLA at
all DCP contents, which is an indication of intense grafting characteristics.
Similar observation can also be drawn from the Han plot shown in Figure 6 (slope of log G′ vs log G″), which
provides information about the dependency of elasticity on loss properties.
As illustrated in Table 2, the slopes of the reactively extruded NPLA samples are observed
to decrease from 1.83 of NPLA (without DCP) to 1.40, 1.28, and 1.20
with 0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt % DCP, respectively. As expected, the introduction
of SNC further decreases the slope at the respective DCP amount. This
result strongly supports the SNC grafting on PLA, which results in
the melt having more solidlike behavior at higher temperature.

Figure 6 Han plot of
NPLA and SNC–PLA at various DCP contents.

Similar observation can also be generated using Cole–Cole
plot, which can be related to their molecular weight and distribution.
As shown in Figure 7, the semicircle curve becomes larger and wider with increasing DCP
weight fraction and with the addition of SNC. This clearly indicates
long-chain branching, cross-linking, and grafting, which are already
observed through molecular weight analysis using GPC. All of these
important observations are an indication of the improvement of the
melt strength of PLA due to the reactive modification. SNC plays a
major role to give remarkable rheological property improvement due
to grafting.

Figure 7 Cole–Cole plots of NPLA and SNC–PLA at various
DCP
contents.

van Gurp (vGP) plot (phase angle
vs log G*) has been used as a tool to understand
the impact of long-chain branching on the mobility of polymers under
melt condition. Figure 8 shows shifting of phase angle to lower values for modified samples
with increasing DCP weight fractions. The grafting phenomenon observed
in reactively modified SNC–PLA reduces the phase angle as compared
to reactively modified NPLA. Because more solidlike property is introduced
into the PLA matrix, the grafting of thermally stable and highly crystalline
SNC limits the melt macromolecular movement that in turn leads to
the reduction of phase angle.

Figure 8 vGP plots of NPLA and SNC–PLA at various
DCP contents.

Investigation of the
rheological properties of modified samples
is very complicated and it needs to be correlated with other characterization
techniques. Predicting the macromolecular structural change is a big
task because many simultaneous reactions take place in parallel, which
give different macromolecular melt topologies. Due to this fact, limitation
arises to fit the rheological data to different rheological models
to have insight into the relaxation process. Taking this into consideration,
the Carreau–Yasuda model (eq 2) is used to fit the melt rheology data and provide
macromolecular chain relaxation phenomena through estimation of characteristic
relaxation time (λ), zero shear viscosity (η0), Newtonian transition factor (a), and power law
index (n). 2  As illustrated in Figure 9, with the values listed in Table 3, the zero shear viscosity (η0) significantly increases from 730 Pa s (NPLA) by factors
of 2, 25, and 225 for DCP weight fractions of 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively.
As compared to NPLA, the change further increased by factors of 1.6,
15, 40, and 1012 at DCP weight fractions of 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively,
for reactively modified SNC–PLA samples. As already discussed
above, enhancement in the molecular weight through chain extension,
long-chain branching, and cross-linking with significant grafting
can be mentioned as a reason for the observed substantial increase
in zero shear viscosity. Due to the same reason, the modified samples
took relatively longer relaxation time and characteristic relaxation
time (λ) of NPLA increased from 0.032 to 94 and 35 s for modified
NPLA (1.5% DCP) and SNC–PLA (1.5% DCP).

The weighted relaxation spectrum
(λH(λ)),
which is estimated from linear relaxation spectrum, as proposed by
Honerkamp and Weese, can be used to understand the time distribution
of the chain relaxation mechanism. The relaxation processes of unmodified
and modified NPLA and SNC–PLA samples are presented in Figure 10a–d, and
for better understanding, the chain relaxation processes are further
presented at various ranges of relaxation time (0.001–1 and
0.001–100). As indicated in Figure 10a, NPLA is observed to have one relaxation
peak at λ ∼ 0.05 s, which indicates the linear polymer
chain relaxation. Due to the possible long-chain grafting of PLA chains
on the active surface of SNCs, a second melt relaxation is observed
at λ ∼ 230 s other than the linear polymer chain relaxation
peak at λ ∼ 0.05 s. In Figure 10b–d, the polymer melt macromolecular
chain structure is completely modified after the addition of DCP.
Long-chain branching can be confirmed from the longer-time relaxation
peak, which is observed to increase with increasing DCP weight fraction.
The polymeric melt becomes more entangled, and partial cross-linking
can also be mentioned as one of the reasons for the observed significant
change in the relaxation process.

2.3 Crystallization, Melting
Behavior, and Thermal
Stability
Poly(lactic acid) is known to have a slow crystallization behavior
and thus it is difficult to crystallize it from liquid phase even
at low cooling rate. The melting and crystallization characteristics
of polymer matrix are strongly influenced by the chain topology. Because
of this, before giving explanation on the thermal characteristics
of reactively modified samples, it is required to summarize and categorize
the chain topology induced by the reactive extrusion. On the basis
of the above obtained results, macromolecular chain modifications
are grouped into three categories to simplify the explanation: scenario
1, short- and long-chain branching (0.5DCP–PLA); scenario 2,
cross-linking and branching (1DCP–PLA and 1.5DCP–PLA);
and scenario 3, grafting (in all DCP–SNC–PLA). The effect
of chain topology modification on the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) thermographs of cooling and second heating is displayed in Figure 11, and the values
of glass-transition temperature (Tg),
onset and maximum cold crystallization temperatures (Tc,onset, Tc,max), onset and
maximum melting temperatures (Tm,onset, Tm,max), and enthalpies of crystallization
and melting are listed in Table 4. In all scenarios, no significant change is observed
on Tg values. Melt-extruded PLA at high
temperature and shear is known for melt recrystallization process
and produces defect or imperfect crystals, which melt in two stages.
If lower-molecular-weight fraction is increased, the melt recrystallization
phenomenon can occur relatively at lower temperature because the short
chains can easily rearrange to recrystallize at lower temperature.
On the other hand, when a nucleating agent is present in the matrix,
the melt crystallization process can also occur at lower temperature.
However, reduction observed in cold crystallization temperature (Tcc) by 3 °C (scenario 1) as compared to
NPLA (Tcc ∼ 115 °C) can be
related to the increment in the free volume due to short-chain branching,
which leads to the formation of unstable crystals that increase the
chain mobility and gives a double-melting peak, which is shifted to
lower temperature as compared to NPLA. This phenomenon was briefly
explained by Bian et al. for reactively extruded short-chain branched
poly(3-hydoxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate).33 The melt crystallization phenomenon of NPLA
was not affected by the reactive modification at lower DCP content
(0.5 wt %), and no crystallization peak was observed during cooling,
which indicates the slow crystallization process, in which the cooling
rate (5 °C/min) is too high for the nucleation and growth of
crystals (Figure 11).

On the other hand, the slow
melt crystallization process of NPLA
is significantly enhanced for scenario 2 (1DCP–PLA and 1.5DCP–PLA)
with a small fraction of melt recrystallization, which can be strongly
related to the cross-linking and branching, as shown by gel percentage
and other rheology results. Interestingly, percentage crystallinity
increased from 1% (0.5DCP–PLA) to 22% (1DCP–PLA) and
decreased to 17% (1.5DCP–PLA). This crystallization behavior
can be explained as follows: the rate of crystallization increased
drastically as the macromolecular chain topology is changed from short-chain
branching to cross-linking with lower gel percentage (low cross-linking
fraction), and further increasing in cross-linking fraction hinders
the chain rearrangement due to intense entanglement, which results
in reduction of crystallization rate. As clearly shown in Figure 11c, the double-melting
peaks observed for NPLA and 0.5DCP–PLA merged into one for
cross-linked and branched samples (1DCP–PLA and 1.5DCP–PLA),
due to the formation of more stable crystals.

As reported in Table 4, lower Tcc (by 5 °C) and distinguished
double-melting peaks are observed for SNC–PLA compared to NPLA,
which is attributed to early-stage formation of crystals due to the
nucleating effect of SNC. However, in scenario 3 (unlike 0.5DCP–PLA),
the reactive extrusion at lower DCP content (0.5 wt %) and 1% SNC
changes the melting and crystallization processes. The rates of crystallization
are enhanced, and melt crystallization is observed at the given cooling
rate, which is missing in 0.5DCP–PLA. These interesting characteristics
can be correlated with the grafting of SNC on the PLA chain, which
provides nucleation site for the melt to arrange in an ordered form.
The increment in interfacial adhesion between highly ordered crystalline
SNC and amorphous PLA chains due to the formation of C–C cross-links
leads to diminution of free volume, which improves the polymer chain
folding guided by SNC, and crystallization upon cooling is enhanced.
This can also be correlated with the reduction of activation energy
required for chain folding by overcoming the barrier energy through
SNC grafting. The crystallization percentage decreases from 23% (0.5DCP–SNC–PLA)
to 19% (1DCP–SNC–PLA) and 15% (1.5DCP–SNC–PLA)
due to the increase in grafting and cross-linking fractions that leads
to the restriction of macromolecular movement in melt (increase in
entanglement). The double-melting peak observed at 0.5DCP–SNC–PLA
is merged into a single peak at 1 and 1.5 wt % of DCP. As already
discussed above, the double-melting peak occurs because of the melt
recrystallization due to the short-chain branching, which further
improves and forms stable crystals with increasing grafting efficiency
and cross-linking.

Before X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis,
reactively extruded samples
are kept in an vacuum oven at 95 °C for 2 h. The onset temperature
for the cold crystallization (∼95 °C) process of PLA obtained
from the first heating cycle is taken as the reference point. The
representative peaks observed at 16.5 and 18.8° on the XRD diffractogram
represent the α-form of PLA crystals having crystalline planes
of (011) and (110)/(200), respectively.28 As clearly indicated in Figure 12, crystallinity of NPLA is observed to be improved
by the addition of SNC and further improved by the reactive extrusion.
No intense peak is observed for neat PLA, whereas the addition of
DCP improves the crystallization process, which can be observed by
the intense peak at 16.5°. Maximum intensity is observed at 1
wt % DCP for the case of NPLA, which decreases with increasing the
DCP content to 1.5 wt %, indicating that the fraction of cross-linking
sites up to some extent can be used as a nucleation site to rearrange
the macromolecules, in which further cross-linking may lead to restriction
of the macromolecular chain rearrangement and tends to hinder the
crystallization process. However, the intensity at 16.5° is observed
to increase with increasing DCP content for the case of the SNC–PLA
system. This shows that the crystallization process is highly influenced
by grafting of SNCs, in which the macromolecular arrangement of PLA
chains is directed by highly ordered SNC β-sheets.

d: 1.5DCP–PLA, e: SNC–PLA, f: 0.5DCP–SNC–PLA,
g: 1DCP–SNC–PLA, and h: 1.5DCP–SNC–PLA).

Figure 13 illustrates
the effect of reactive modification on the thermal stability of NPLA
and SNC–PLA nanocomposites, and the values are listed in Table 5. SNC–PLA (without
the addition of DCP) exhibits the highest thermal stability, in which T5% ∼ 334 °C is observed to be 10
°C higher than that in NPLA. It confirms that the incorporation
of SNC alone can enhance the thermal stability of PLA. Stabilizing
effect of SNC is already studied in our previous investigation for
PLA system under multiple extrusion cycles.12 A slight reduction in T5% is observed
with the addition of DCP, and it reaches ∼322 °C for 1.5DCP–PLA.
Relatively higher values of T5% are obtained
for SNC–PLA compared to NPLA at all DCP fractions. No significant
change is observed for T95%. However, Tmax reduced from ∼371 °C (NPLA and
SNC–PLA) to ∼363 °C (1.5DCP–PLA and 1.5DCP–SNC–PLA).

Decomposition process of
the polymeric system is facilitated when
the number of shorter chains increases. The observed broadening of
molecular weight distribution (increasing in PDI) with increasing
DCP weight fraction cloud be the reason for the lowering of thermal
stability at the decomposing temperature.

The presence of silk
nanocrystals is confirmed from the higher-magnification
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images, as clearly
shown in Figure 14a,b. Due to the hydrophobic nature of SNCs, proper dispersion with
minimum agglomeration is achieved in the hydrophobic PLA matrix. SNC
is encapsulated inside the PLA matrix due to grafting, and microgel
structure is observed in the morphology of the reactively extruded
SNC–PLA (Figure 14d). From this, it can be concluded that the interfacial compatibility
between PLA and SNC is improved and the grafting structure increases
the dispersion and forms more cross-linked networks. The physical
appearances of neat PLA, SNC–PLA, and SNC-grafted PLA samples
at different DCP contents are displayed in Figure 14c; the transparency of the film is observed
to decrease with increasing amount of DCP loading. As discussed above,
the reactive extrusion in the presence of SNC provides significant
grafting opportunity for the PLA macromolecules on the surface of
SNC, which is an instantaneous process that improves the crystallinity.
Transparency of the polymer film tends to decrease with increasing
crystallinity and cross-linking efficiency.

2.4 Effect of Reactive Modification on Recyclability
Performance of PLA
The influence of reactive extrusion on
the reprocessability performance (up to three cycles) of NPLA, 1DCP–PLA,
SNC–PLA, and 1DCP–SNC–PLA is studied. Zero shear
viscosity, crossover points, and ratio of zero shear viscosity of Ri (“i” represents
reprocessing cycles) to pristine PLA of R0 and R3 are used to evaluate the macromolecular
change induced by the reprocessing cycles. As observed in Table 6, the zero shear viscosity
of reactively modified samples drastically reduced after recycling.
However, referring to the zero shear viscosity of R3-NPLA (433 Pa s), it is clearly observed that the reprocessed
reactive extrusion samples have higher melt strength. Furthermore,
the grafting of SNC increases the zero shear viscosity and shifts
the crossover frequency to lower values.

2.5 Conclusions
Reactively extruded NPLA
and SNC–PLA with possible branching/cross-linking and grafting
chain topologies have been demonstrated successfully, and their chemical
structure, molar mass distribution, rheological characteristics, and
thermal stability are investigated in detail. Three different scenarios
are observed, including branching (0.5DCP–PLA), cross-linking
and branching (1DCP–PLA and 1.5DCP–SNC–PLA),
and grafting (DCP–SNC–PLA at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt % DCP).
These three scenarios provide different levels of impact on important
characteristic properties, such as structural and rheological behaviors,
of the polymer. Bond formation between SNC (serine −CH2OH) and PLA main backbone carbon identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy confirms the grafting of SNC. Furthermore, all
of the rheological properties (i.e., zero shear viscosity, storage
modulus, crossover point, etc.) significantly improved with the grafting,
which increases the reprocessability performance of PLA. The melting
and crystallization phenomenon of PLA also completely changed with
cross-linking and SNC grafting. Crystallinity percentage improved
and PLA is observed to crystallize during cooling with cross-linking
and SNC grafting. From this study, it can be concluded that the reactive
extrusion of PLA in the presence of SNC will lead to the grafting
topology with improved melt strength and other essential properties.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
In this study,
NatureWorks’s poly(lactic acid) (PLA) (grade 2003D)
with melt flow index of 6.0 g/10 min at 210 °C is used. It has
number-average molecular weight (Mn),
weight-average molecular weight (Mw),
and polydispersity index (PDI) of ∼96 kDa, ∼207 kDa,
and 2.15, respectively, which are estimated by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC). Silk nanocrystals (SNCs) were prepared in lab as reported34,35 and dried for 24 h at 60 °C under vacuum. Dicumyl peroxide
(DCP) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India, to be used as radical
initiator in the reactive extrusion. Muga silk cocoons (Antheraea assama) are delivered from Regional Muga
Silk Station, Boko, Assam, India.

3.2 Preparation
of Silk Nanocrystals (SNCs)
Impurities (eggs and plant debris)
were removed from the cocoons
and degummed at 98 °C for 30 min with 0.5% (w/w) sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3), followed by washing multiple times
with deionized water to remove salts. Prior to acid hydrolysis, the
degummed fibroin was kept overnight in a hot air oven at 60 °C
to remove moisture. Hydrolysis of dried muga fibroin was performed
in aqueous sulfuric acid (64 wt %) for 2 h at 45 °C, followed
by washing the hydrolysate multiple times with deionized water and
centrifuging three times (10 000 rpm for 15 min each time)
to isolate silk nanocrystals (SNCs). Finally, the pH of SNC suspension
was maintained around 7 through continuous dialysis for ∼48
h and sonication was performed to homogenize the dispersion, followed
by freeze drying after quench freezing with liquid nitrogen to obtain
dried SNC powder for the current work.

3.3 Reactive
Extrusion
Prior to the reactive
extrusion process, PLA granules and silk nanocrystals were dried overnight
at 60 °C under vacuum. Dicumyl peroxide (DCP) at three different
percentage weight fractions (0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt %) was dissolved in
acetone and mixed with PLA granules and freeze-dried SNCs (1 wt %),
followed by removal of acetone to have proper dispersion of DCP on
the PLA and SNC surface. The reactive extrusions were performed using
HAAKE MiniLab corotating twin-screw extruder at a screw speed of 40
rpm, 185 °C, and residence time of ∼5 min. The samples
were collected and kept under vacuum at 40 °C for further characterizations.
The same procedures were followed for neat PLA in the presence of
DCP to analyze the effect of SNC alone. Molecular weight analysis
was performed for the samples collected at ∼3 and ∼5
min intervals.

The processing temperature for the reactive extrusion
is selected on the basis of the processing temperature of PLA and
thermal decomposition temperature of dicumyl peroxide (DCP). Reports
showed that DCP decomposes into free radicals in the temperature range
of 180–190 °C with a lifetime of 190 s.32,36 In our previous investigation, the thermal decomposition behavior
of silk nanocrystals (SNCs) was studied thoroughly with the help of
thermogravimetry-coupled Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR).
From this study, we observe that decomposition of SNC starts at 280
°C, which is much higher than the processing temperature selected
for the reactive extrusion. The degradation of SNCs occurs in a wide
range of temperature (280–570 °C). From the Gram–Schmidt
curve, we observed that SNC decomposes in two major stages: In the
first stage, 30% decomposition occurs in the temperature range of
310–404 °C, which is the same range for 100% decomposition
of neat poly(lactic acid) (NPLA) and SNC–PLA; In the 2nd stage,
60% decomposition occurs at a temperature range of 404–606
°C, which confirms thermal stability of SNCs.12,37

3.4 Reprocessing
In this study, NPLA
and SNC–PLA with 1 wt % DCP were melt-reprocessed three times
(temperature, 200 °C; screw speed, 100 rpm; and 1 min recycling),
and rheological investigation is performed to understand the change.
Zero shear viscosity and crossover frequencies are selected to assess
the effect of melt-reprocessing cycles on reactively modified PLA.
Under dynamic frequency sweep analysis, zero shear viscosity provides
reliable information about the molecular-level structural change and
has been used to predict the molecular weight as the frequency reaches
zero. Crossover frequency is also another important parameter to evaluate
the solidlike and liquidlike dominances of the melt.

The samples,
neat PLA and PLA/silk nanocrystal biocomposites, which are extruded
in the presence of different radical initiator (DCP) contents of 0,
0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt % are reported as NPLA, 0.5DCP–NPLA, 1DCP–NPLA,
1.5DCP–NPLA, SNC–PLA, 0.5DCP–SNC–PLA,
1DCP–SNC–PLA, and 1.5DCP–SNC–PLA.

3.5 Characterization
3.5.1 Molecular Weight Analysis
Number-average
and weight-average molecular weights of reactively modified samples
are estimated using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with refractive
index detector (RID-10A), at 1 mL/min eluent flow rate and 40 μL
sample injection volume. The samples (30 mg) are dissolved in 1.5
mL of high-performance liquid chromatography-grade chloroform for
3 days and filtered using 0.25 μm filters. The instrument was
calibrated with polystyrene standards.

3.5.2 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
The effect of DCP
on the structural modification of
PLA/SNC nanocomposite was monitored using FTIR (PerkinElmer) attenuated
total reflectance (ATR) mode in the range of 4000–650 cm–1 with 4 cm–1 resolution and 64 scan
rate.

3.5.3 NMR Analysis
The macromolecular
structural change of NPLA and SNC–PLA composite occurs due
to the reactive extrusion process, which is investigated using a 600
MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The samples were
dissolved in deutrated chloroform (CDCl3) for 3 days and
filtered with a 0.25 μm filter prior to the analysis.

3.5.4 Optical Polarity
The specific and
optical rotations of reactively extruded NPLA and SNC–PLA with
various amounts of DCP are estimated using AUTOPOL II polarimeter
(Rudolph Research Laboratory) at a wavelength of 589 nm using a self-calibrated
mechanism. The sample (200 mg) was dissolved in 20 mL of chloroform
and filtered with a 0.25 μm filter prior to analysis.

3.5.5 XRD
The impact of reactive extrusion
in the presence of SNC on the crystallographic behavior of PLA was
investigated by wide-angle X-ray diffraction analysis using D8 Advance
diffractometer (Bruker, Germany), with an X-ray source (40 kV, 40
mA) of Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). Each sample was
conditioned at 95 °C for 2 h before the analysis, and the test
was performed at a scan rate of 0.05°/0.5 s with 2θ values
ranging from 5 to 50°.

3.5.6 Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The thermal characteristics of
reactively extruded NPLA and SNC–PLA
samples were analyzed using a differential scanning calorimeter (Netzsch,
Germany). Samples weighing ∼6 mg were placed in a platinum
crucible and scanned for a cycle of heat/cool/heat at a rate of 5
°C/min in the temperature range of 25–200 °C. Isothermal
conditions were maintained at 200 °C for 3 min to erase the processing
and thermal history after the first heating cycle. Data from the cooling
and second heating cycles were considered for further analysis. Glass-transition
temperature (Tg), cold crystallization
(Tcc), melting temperature (Tm), heat of crystallization (Hcc), and heat of fusion (Hm) were estimated.

3.5.7 Thermal Degradation Analysis
Thermal
degradation analyses of reactively modified NPLA and SNC–PLA
were performed by PerkinElmer TGA4000. Each sample (6–10 mg)
was scanned from 30 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
in the presence of inert nitrogen atmosphere.

3.5.8 Rheological Investigation
Rheological
properties of each sample were investigated using interfacial rheometer
(Anton-Paar model: MCR 301) at a temperature of 190 °C. Before
the dynamic frequency sweep test analysis, amplitude sweep test was
performed to estimate the linear viscoelastic region, and 5% strain
is selected. Dynamic frequency sweep test analysis was performed in
the frequency range of 0.1–600 Hz.
