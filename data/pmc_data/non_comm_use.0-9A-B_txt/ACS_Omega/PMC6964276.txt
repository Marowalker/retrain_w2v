A one-dimensional Cu(II) coordination polymer with encapsulated
antiferromagnetically coupled binuclear Cu(II) has been synthesized
by using 5-nitroisophthalic acid (5-N-IPA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-APY)
[Cu2(5-N-IPA)2(4-APY)4]n (1). Electrical properties are examined
by complex impedance (Z*), dielectric permittivity
(ε*), and ac conductivity studies at different frequencies (10
kHz–5 MHz) and temperatures (253–333 K). The contribution
of grain and grain boundary has been explained by a different theoretical
model. The variable temperature magnetic susceptibility data for compound 1 were recorded between 300 and 2 K. The shape of the curve
(χMT vs T) indicates
dominant antiferromagnetic coupling, which results from the interaction
between the copper(II) atoms.

Introduction
Coordination polymers (CPs)1−7 have been commodiously used in various fields, such as in supercapacitors,8−11 batteries,12 gas storage and separation,
sensing,13 and electrocatalysis.14 But CPs with prominent magnetic and dielectric
properties have garnered great attention as functional materials due
to their embryonic applications in various fields, such as for electromagnetic
interference shielding,15 capacitors,16,17 microwave tunable devices,18,19 and broadband electric-field
tunable devices.20 Dielectric spectroscopy
is routinely used to accumulate the information on the ac conduction
mechanism and dielectric relaxation in an immense frequency range
for different temperatures. The flexible qualitative delineation often
provides new intuition into the field of dielectric behavior. For
example, localized (i.e., long-range conductivity) and non-localized
(i.e., dielectric relaxation) conduction processes inside the material
can be esteemed by the nonexistence or existence of a relaxation peak
in a frequency-dependent hypothetical modulus plot. The performance
of dielectric parameter has been explored on transition metal oxide
amorphous semiconductor, oxide perovskite material, ionically conducting
polymer, and conducting glass.21−23 Recently, a comprehensive study
on ac conductivity and dielectric relaxation of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I) has been reported, which shows
the dominance of non-Debye-type relaxation inside the material.24,25 In order to acquire long-range charge conduct and obvious magnetic
behavior, it is pivotal for these compounds to have a tough intramolecular
coupling and strong intermolecular ordering. One of the incredible
characteristics of CP is its potential to acquire a distinct structural
architecture under varying environments. The functional groups of
the ligands and the length of the organic spacer, the reaction condition,
and the nature and oxidation of metal ions immensely control the structure
of the CPs. Among the 3d transition metal ions, nontoxic Cu(II) (d9) can display a wide distinction of structures and nuclearity.
The magnetic superexchange interactions in the middle of copper centers
across the bridging ligands of Cu(II) compounds are established.26,51 But the charge transfer mechanism and dielectric behavior of CPs
have not been much explored. Recently, Zuo et al.28 and Loh et al.27 have reported
the magnetic and conductivity property of copper-based CPs.

In this work, the 5-nitroisophthalate ion forms a 1D CP with Cu(II)
metal node, and two axial positions are occupied by 4-aminopyridine
(4-APY). The structure shows encapsulation of dinuclear Cu(II) in
the 1D CP. The multinuclear Cu(II)-CP shows antiferromagnetic coupling
and temperature-dependent dielectric properties.

Results and Discussion
Structure and Morphology of Compound 1, [Cu2(5-N-IPA)2(4-APY)4]n
[Cu2(5-N-IPA)2(4-APY)4]n crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group with Z = 4, and the details of refinement parameters and crystal
data for compound 1 are tabulated in Table S1. The structural analysis of 1 has revealed
that there are two types of copper centers (Figure 1a). One of them forms a 1D polymeric network
via carboxylato bridging in the square of 5-N-IPA. 4-APY is appended
to the axial coordination site of Cu(II) in the dimensional network
and is hydrogen bonded (3.32 Å) with the amino group of another
1D network to form a porous 2D network (Figure 1c). In the pore of this 2D network, dinuclear
Cu(II) are encapsulated by the help of hydrogen bonding and π···π
interactions (Figure 1d). The geometry around Cu centers in dinuclear Cu(II) is a distorted
square pyramidal, where Cu···Cu separation lies in
the range 3.388 Å.

These complexes have the potential to form higher
dimensional structures
throughout H-bonding (2.865–3.320 Å) and supramoleculer
(aromatic π···π) interactions (3.869–4.148
Å), (Figures 1b and S).29−32,51,52 Some selected bond lengths and bond angles
in 1 are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S2). Furthermore, the morphology of 1 was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM). Figure 2 displays
that the nanosheets are firmly stacked and intertwined with each other.

Thermogravimetric Analysis and Powder X-ray Diffraction Analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of compound 1 is
displayed showing that the compound is thermally stable up to 373
K (Figure S2). Therefore, no decomposition
or deformation of compound 1 occurs at examined temperatures.
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-synthesized
compound exhibit broad diffraction peaks at 2θ (degree) as follows:
9.34, 10.55, 11.56, 14.38, 16.80, 19.48, 20.43, 22.55, 23.66, 26.28,
and 30.23, which correspond to the (111), (120), (200), (102), (122),
(132), (302), (042), (113), (322), and (502) planes, respectively.
These were matched with the corresponding peaks of the simulated pattern,
which confirmed that the bulk sample was uncontaminated (Figure S3).

Magnetic Study
The variable temperature magnetic susceptibility
data for compound 1 were recorded between 300 and 2 K.
A plot of χMT versus T is shown in Figure 3. At room temperature, χMT is equal
to 1.586 cm3 kmol–1, which is close to
four uncoupled copper(II) ions with local spin S =
1/2 and g ≈ 2.06.

Figure 3 Plot of χMT vs T for compound 1 (per four Cu atoms). The solid line
shows the best fit of the data (see text).

When the sample is cooled, χMT decreases slowly, and below 75 K, it decreases more rapidly
to a
value of 0.634 cm3 kmol–1 at 2 K, which
is slightly less for two isolated Cu(II) ions (0.75 cm3 kmol–1). The shape of this curve indicates dominant
antiferromagnetic coupling, which results from the interaction between
the copper(II) atoms. To fit the magnetic data, we consider two of
the four copper present in the elemental cell as isolated from the
magnetic point of view.

The interaction through the 5-nitroisophthalate
ligand in the monodimensionl
fragment must be negligible (Cu···Cu = 10.225 Å)
(Figure 4), thus following
the Curie law for each isolated Cu(II). This part can be subtracted
from the global magnetic susceptibility to give only that corresponding
to the dinuclear fragment [Cu(II)]2, which is aniferromagnetically
coupled. Considering the above, the experimental data were fitted
to the Bleaney–Bowers expression for an isotropically coupled
pair of S = 1/2 ions (eq 1),33 in conjunction
with an additional mean field correction term, χMF (eq 2), where N is Avogadro’s number, μB is the
Bohr magneton, k is the Boltzmann constant, and z is the number of nearest neighbors.

Figure 4 Structure of compound 1 showing the dinuclear and
catena Cu(II) fragments formed.

The best least-squares fit parameters gave J =
−29.5 cm–1, zJ′ =
−0.5 cm–1, g = 2.09, and R = 8.21 × 10–5 = ∑i(χMTcal – χMTobs)2/(χMTobs)2. 1   2  

The field dependence of magnetization
(0–5 T) measured at
2 K for compound 1 is shown in Figure 5, in the form of M/NμB (per Cu4 unit) versus H/G. The magnetization reaches a value of 1.79 M/NμB at 5 T, which is slightly
less than the expected S = 1/2 value of two isolated
copper(II) atoms.

function for two isolated S = 1/2 and g = 2.0.

Dielectric Studies
The complex dielectric permittivity,
ε*, of a material can be expressed as eq 3(34,35) 3  where ε′(ω) and ε″(ω)
are the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant
and ω = 2πf. Here, ε′(ω)
and ε″(ω) represent the amount of electrical potential
energy stored and the amount of energy dissipated due to polarization,
respectively.36,37 The real and imaginary dielectric
constants of the complex can be calculated from the measured capacitance
in parallel mode using eqs 4 and 5 4   5  where Cp is known
as the capacitance of the sample, ε0 (8.85 ×
10–14 F/cm) is the dielectric permittivity in vacuum, A is the effective surface area of the pellet, d is the thickness of the pellet, and tan δ is the loss tangent
or dissipation factor. The frequency dependence ε′(ω)
for compound 1 depicts (Figure 6) that ε′(ω) decreases
gradually with increasing frequency. This behavior is in agreement
with the natural properties of organic and inorganic hybrid materials.44−47 It has been observed that at a low frequency, ε′(ω)
is increased with increasing temperature. Generally, there are four
types of polarization, electronic, ionic, orientation, and space charge
polarization, which are mainly responsible for the high dielectric
constant of the material.35,50 This dielectric constant
also strongly depends on the purity and perfection of the synthesized
samples. The increase in ε′(ω) of this material
may be due to the presence of metal ions with organic moieties and
the non-bridging oxygen atom, which generate a dangling bond.48,49 These metal ions contribute to the space charge polarization, which
leads to the increase in ε′(ω). A small change
in ε′(ω) with increasing applied temperatures is
also observed for all samples, which may be due to the increase in
ionic polarization in the low-frequency region.38,39

Figure 6 Frequency
dependence ε′(ω) at different temperatures
of compound 1.

The frequency and temperature dependence ε″(ω)
(Figure 7) for this
material shows that ε″(ω) decreases with increasing
frequency at all temperatures. It has been observed that ε″(ω)
increases faster with temperature in the low-frequency region. TThis
may be due to the potential barriers generated by the crystal defects
in the material for charge transport process. As a result, the contribution
of space charges becomes limited until they are stopped at the grain
boundary. In the low-frequency region, four types of polarizations
contribute significantly to ε″(ω), but the contribution
of ionic and orientational polarizations reduces in the higher frequency
region. This effect decreases ε″(ω) with the increase
in frequency for the examined temperatures.40,41

ε″(ω) at different temperatures
of compound 1.

Complex Impedance Study
The complex impedance properties
of compound 1 have been performed over an extensive range
of frequency from 10 kHz to 5 MHz for different temperatures (253–333
K) using complex impedance spectroscopy. This is the most important
method to explain the ionic movement mechanism of a material and the
contribution of grain boundary and grain.42 Detailed information about the resistive and capacitive properties
of the material can be obtained from this study. The frequency-dependence
complex impedance (Z*) can be obtained using this
model and is represented as eq 6 6  where the frequency-dependence real part of
impedance Z′(ω) and the imaginary part
of impedance Z″(ω) can be expressed
as eqs 7 and 8 7   8  where ω = 2πf, Rg = grain resistance, Cg = grain capacitance, Rgb = grain boundary resistance, and Cgb = grain boundary capacitance.34,35,42

The variation in Z′(ω) as a
function of frequency and temperature (Figure 8) for compound 1 follows a sigmoidal-type
pattern with an increase in the frequency. The Z′(ω)
values are higher in the low-frequency region and consequently decrease
with an increase in frequency and temperature. This nature reveals
the increase in ac conductivity as well as the presence of the negative
temperature coefficient of resistance of this material, which can
generally suggest the semiconducting nature of this compound. Higher
values of Z′(ω) at low frequency and
temperature significantly reveal the effect of large polarization.
The decrease in Z′(ω) value at a higher
frequency and temperature clearly indicates the less contribution
of grain boundaries in the total resistance, leading to an increase
in ac conductivity with an increase in the temperature as well as
frequency (Figure 9).35

temperatures of compound 1.

temperatures of compound 1.

ac Conductivity
To explain the effect of Cu centers
on the electrical conductivity of the one-dimensional Cu(II) CP with
encapsulated antiferromagnetically coupled dinuclear Cu(II), the electrical
conductivity measurement has also been done. Figure 10 reveals the variation in ac conductivity
for compound 1. The lower conductivity for the material
could be attributed to the low level of protonation of the carboxylate,
nitro, and/or amino groups of the CP. The enhancement of ac conductivity
for this material comes from the effective dispersion of the compound
in the matrix, which favors improved electronic transport. It can
be observed that the conductivity of the one-dimensional Cu(II) CP
with encapsulated antiferromagnetically coupled dinuclear Cu(II) increases
with frequency and the slope becomes higher in the higher frequency
region. The ac conductivity is also considered to be the combined
effect of intrinsic electric dipole polarization and interface charge
polarization.

Figure 10 Frequency dependence of σac(ω)
at different
temperatures of compound 1.

The phenomenon appears in the metal organic polymeric
system. The
reason behind this is the piling of mobile charges at the interfaces,
as a result of which large dipoles on metal particles or clusters
are made. Polarization as well as ac conduction inside the CP is found
to be dependent on the concentration of these metal particles.34,36,43

Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized one-dimensional
Cu(II) CP with
encapsulated antiferromagnetically coupled dinuclear Cu(II) with fascinating
dielectrical and magnetic properties. The charge transfer mechanism
and dielectric relaxation throughout the CP have been established.
However, the overall electromagnetic properties and the effect of
temperature on the electromagnetic behavior of compound 1 reveal that our as-synthesized polymer will be suitable for energy
storage applications in future; still, more enhancements are yet to
be done to achieve an optimized energy storage device.

Experimental Section
Materials and General Method
Sigma-Aldrich has provided
all the required chemicals. Micro-analytical data (C, H, N) were collected
on a PerkinElmer 2400 CHNS/O elemental analyzer. The suitable single
crystal of compound 1 was used for single-crystal diffraction.
A Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) was used for data
collection. The crystal structure was solved by the SHELX-97 package.
Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi)
was used for the morphological study, and the PXRD data were collected
on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.548 Å) generated at 40 kV and 40 mA and in a 2θ
range of 5–50. Magnetic susceptibility measurements for compound 1 were carried out on polycrystalline samples, at the Servei
de Magnetoquímica of the Universitat de Barcelona, with a Quantum
Design SQUID MPMS-XL susceptometer apparatus working in the range
2–300 K under two magnetic field of 500 and 10 000 G.
Diamagnetic corrections were estimated from Pascal tables. Frequency-
and temperature-dependent electrical conductivity and dielectric properties
of compound 1 were measured in the form of pellets (0.44
mm thick and 8.0 mm diameter). The samples are compressed under 5
tons/in.2 pressure using a hydraulic press. The pellet
is placed between two copper electrodes and inserted with a holder
vertically into a cylindrical furnace. All electrical measurements
were done in the frequency range 10 kHz to 5 MHz in the temperature
range 253–333 K using the LCR meter model Hioki IM3536. All
the measurements were done at different temperatures under dark conditions,
and the temperatures were controlled by an indigenous liquid nitrogen
cryostat.

Synthesis of Compound
Figure 11 shows the schematic representation of the
preparation of compound 1. A methanolic solution (2 mL)
of 4-APY (18.82 mg, 0.2 mmol) was judiciously layered using a water–metahnol
(1:1) mixed solvent above the aqueous solution (2 mL) of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, (48.32 mg, 0.2 mmol).
5-Nitroisophthalic acid (5-N-IPA, 42.226 mg, 0.2 mmol) in ethanol
(2 mL) was deprotonated by Et3N (40.476 mg, 0.2 mmol) and
was layered carefully above the 4-APY to build an uninterrupted layer.
It was then allowed to diffuse, and the deep-blue-colored block-shaped
crystals were settled on the glass wall after a week. Under a microscope,
the crystals were separated and washed with methanol and water (1:1)
mixed solvent and dried. The yield of [Cu2(5-N-IPA)2(4-APY)4]n, was 84%
(91.84 mg). The elemental analysis for the compound was found: C,
43.87; H, 7.9; N, 14.23%.
