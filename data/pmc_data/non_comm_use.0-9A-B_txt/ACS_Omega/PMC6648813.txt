The metal–support interaction
plays an important role in
gold catalysis. We employ here crystalline cubic (α-) and hexagonal
(β-) phases of heterometallic fluoride NaYF4 nanoparticles
(NPs), obtained by the decomposition of a single source precursor
[NaY(TFA)4(diglyme)] (TFA = trifluoroacetate), as nonoxide
supports for gold catalysts. Using an isostructural gadolinium analogue,
we also obtained doped α-NaYF4:Gd3+ and
β-NaYF4:Gd3+ NPs. A successful deposition
of ∼1% by weight gold NPs of average size 5–6.5 nm on
these doped and undoped metal fluorides using HAuCl4·3H2O afforded Au/NaYF4 catalysts which were thoroughly
characterized by using several physicochemical techniques such as
X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A comparative
study of the above catalysts for different oxidation reactions show
that while for the aerobic oxidation of trans-stilbene
in solution phase, they are either better (in terms of stilbene conversion)
or at par (in terms of trans-stilbene oxide yield)
in comparison to the reference catalyst Au/TiO2 of the
World Gold Council, their activity toward CO oxidation reactions in
gas phase remains much less than that of gold catalysts supported
on metal oxides.

1 Introduction
Supported
gold nanoparticles (NPs) continue to attract huge attention
because of their relatively unexplored catalytic activity as compared
to other noble metals.1 Apart from the
synthetic methods employed, the size of the gold nanoparticle, and
its valence state, the nature of support is also believed to be a
critical aspect in the catalytic efficiency of gold catalysts.2 The combined effect of these factors leads to
a quite complicated catalytic mechanism for the supported gold systems.
Metal oxides are the most commonly used supports for the gold NPs,
though some other supports such as metal–organic frameworks,
carbon, and zeolites have also been employed.3 In oxidation reactions particularly, the activation of molecular
oxygen is of utmost importance, and the support should be involved
in dissociating molecular oxygen at the perimeter sites of the gold
particles. In metal oxide-supported gold catalysts, the metal–oxide
interface plays an important role in catalytic oxidation reactions
because of the geometric changes and charge transfer between the oxide
support and the metal.4 Because of the
similarity in ionic radii, metal fluoride and metal oxide networks
often exhibit common structural features. Nonetheless, their physical
properties are different, as fluoride because of its high electronegativity
forms much stronger ionic bonding in metal fluorides. Although nanometric
metal fluorides have been recently used as an acidic support to anchor
noble metal centers (including gold) for hydrogenation,5 their potential as a support for oxidation reactions
remains unexplored, mostly because of their perceived instability
in a drastic oxidative environment and generally a low specific surface
area.

In this contribution, we present the application of two
different
phases of NaYF4, namely cubic (α-phase) and hexagonal
(β-phase), as catalyst supports for Au NPs and study their catalytic
performance in oxidation reactions. Among the two phases of NaYF4, the α-phase is kinetically preferred but thermodynamically
less stable.6 The two phases have very
different structures. The cubic NaYF4 has a typical fluorite
structure (CaF2), where the Ca2+ sites are occupied
by Na+ and Y3+ ions randomly, each cation site
being 8-coordinated (Figure 1a). On the other hand, the β-phase of NaYF4, also written as Na1.5Y1.5F6, has
three types of cation sites: a ninefold coordinated site occupied
by Y3+, another ninefold coordinated site occupied randomly
by 1/2 Na+ and 1/2 Y3+, and a sixfold coordinated
position occupied by 1/2 Na+ and vacancies (Figure 1b).7

Selection of a suitable synthetic
route to these nanomaterials
is crucial as the properties of the support as well as the active
catalytic phase may evolve during the preparation of the catalysts.8 The bottom-up synthesis of nanomaterials using
well-defined molecular precursors offers numerous advantages over
other synthetic routes.9 However, thoroughly
characterized single source precursors (SSPs) for metal fluoride nanomaterials
are rather few in number.10 Previously,
we have developed anhydrous homo- and heterometallic trifluoroacetate
(TFA) complexes with glyme ligands as the facile precursors to binary
and ternary metal fluoride nanomaterials, mainly for upconversion
and scintillation applications.11,12 The ancillary glyme
ligand not only ensures the formation of anhydrous complexes by saturating
the coordination sphere of the metal centers, but also acts as a surfactant
during decomposition to check the size of the metal fluoride nanocrystals
and render them monodispersed in organic media. The two phases of
NaYF4 obtained by the abovementioned bottom-up approach
were used as supports, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-protected gold
NPs were deposited on them using HAuCl4·3H2O as the precursor. Following a previous report from this laboratory
which showed an enhanced mass transfer in the Gd3+-doped
Au–TiO2 catalysts,13 we
also doped these α- and β-phases of NaYF4 with
∼3 wt % Gd3+ ions. The purpose of doping was to
improve the wettability of our catalysts in the reaction medium and,
therefore, to enhance the accessibility of the gold nanoparticle to
the reactants, particularly for the solution-phase reaction. Moreover,
the support NaYF4 is an ideal material to be doped with
Gd3+ because of the compatibility of the Y3+ and Gd3+ ions.14 The obtained
Au/α-NaYF4, Au/β-NaYF4, Au/α-NaYF4:Gd3+, and Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ catalysts were thoroughly characterized by using several physicochemical
techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The catalytic efficiency of these materials was
subsequently evaluated in the aerobic epoxidation of trans-stilbene in methylcyclohexane as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and
H2 oxidation in the gas phase.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of NaYF4 Supports and Au/NaYF4 Catalysts
The molecular
precursor [NaY(TFA)4(diglyme)] [where TFA = trifluoroacetate;
diglyme = bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether] starts decomposing in 1-octadecene
at 250 °C to give only α-NaYF4 nanocrystals
(JCPDS: 077-2042) (Scheme 1).12 Because of the presence of
the diglyme ligand, provided in situ by the precursor molecule, no
additional surfactant was needed for the size control of these NaYF4 NPs. At a higher temperature, α- and β-mixed
phases are obtained, the relative ratio of the two phases being dependent
on the reaction temperature. A pure β-phase (JCPDS: 16-0334)
is obtained by calcination of the mixed-phased NCs at 400 °C
in a thermodynamically controlled process.6 Owing to the presence of the diglyme ligand on the surface, as confirmed
by the infrared (IR) spectrum and thermogravimetric and differential
thermal analyses (TG–DTA) (Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information), the α-NaYF4 nanocrystals could be dispersed in organic solvents. However,
the diglyme surfactant is mostly eliminated from the surface of β-NaYF4 upon calcination at 400 °C, which is accompanied by
a decrease in the dispersibility of the NCs in organic solvents and
a slight increase in the average particle size. The TEM images show
well-crystallized particles of sub-30 nanometric size. The HRTEM images,
presented in the insets of Scheme 1, clearly show lattice fringes, thus confirming the
high crystallinity of these particles. This analysis also confirms
the phase-pure single crystal nature of α- and β-NaYF4 NPs.

These Supports
Previous studies
have shown that doping a metal oxide support with
Gd3+ improves the catalytic efficiency of the gold catalysts
in terms of enhanced wettability and mass transfer.13 Therefore, we also synthesized two Gd3+-doped
supports, that is, α-NaYF4:3.7 mol % Gd3+ and β-NaYF4:4.2 mol % Gd3+ (where the
values of mol % refer to the atomic substitution ratio of Y3+ by Gd3+) by decomposing simultaneously the solutions
of two isostructural Na–Y and Na–Gd precursors [NaLn(TFA)4(diglyme)] (Ln = Y, Gd) taken in appropriate ratios. Compared
to the Na–Y precursor, the Na–Gd analogue gives the
β-phase of NaGdF4 NCs on decomposition in 1-octadecene
at 280 °C.12 The different decomposition
behavior of isostructural [NaLn(TFA)4(diglyme)] (Ln = Y
and Gd) is attributed to the fact that the slightly larger Gd3+ (r = 1.11 Å for 9-coordination) ions
can be accommodated in the β-phase easily as compared to the
Y3+ ions (r = 1.07 Å for 9-coordination).14a Previously, Liu et al. observed the α-to-β
phase transition simply by doping NaYF4 with larger Gd3+ cations (30 mol %).14b However,
a small doping of around 4 mol % here does not change the crystalline
phases of NaYF4, as confirmed by powder XRD studies (Figures S3 and S4).

The above two phases of NaYF4 behaved differently during
the colloidal deposition of PVA-protected gold NPs using HAuCl4·3H2O as the precursor. Although gold loading
of 0.77 and 0.94 wt % could be achieved within 1 h for α-NaYF4 and α-NaYF4:Gd3+, respectively,
it took about 12 and 16 h of reaction time for the loading of 0.72
and 0.85 wt % in the case of β-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4:Gd3+, respectively. The XRD patterns of the α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4 phases before and after the
deposition of gold NPs were similar, indicating that the presence
of gold does not alter the structures of the two supports (Figures S3 and S4).
No peaks for gold NPs were observed in the XRD patterns, which is
consistent with the previous observation that, unless the Rietveld
method is employed for the refinement of crystalline structure, highly
dispersed gold NPs cannot be detected by XRD.8 The particle size distribution histograms, as obtained by direct
observation of the TEM images, show a relatively narrow size distribution
for the gold NPs (Figures 2 and 3). From these TEM images, average
gold particle sizes of 6.5 and 4.9 nm were calculated for α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4, respectively. On the other
hand, there was no marked difference in the average size of gold NPs
for the two doped catalysts (5.1 nm for both α-NaYF4:Gd3+ and β-NaYF4:Gd3+). The
HRTEM images clearly show the lattice fringes of highly crystalline
gold NPs. The EDX analyses confirmed the presence of all the elements
expected in these catalysts, that is, Na, Y, Gd (in case of doped
catalysts), F, Au, O, and C (Figure S5).
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were
performed on all the catalysts prepared here to evaluate their surface
characteristics. The BET surface area and BJH average pore diameter
for the Au/α-NaYF4 catalyst were found to be 96 m2/g and 6.1 nm, respectively (Figure S6). Generally speaking, NaYF4 and related materials exhibit
a low surface area (typically less than 15 m2/g).15 No doubt, the high surface area observed here
is due to the surface-passivating effects of the diglyme ligand, which
results in the formation of small NPs and an imperfect packing for
them. On doping with Gd3+, however, the surface area decreases
to 11 m2/g. In contrast, the catalysts based on both doped
and undoped β-NaYF4 supports show a poor BET specific
surface area (4–9 m2/g). Some important data on
the above-obtained Au/NaYF4 materials are collected in Table 1.

To have a better understanding of
the interaction between the gold
NPs and fluorinated supports, the XPS studies were conducted on all
the four catalysts as well as the support NaYF4 itself.
The wide scan spectra reveal the co-presence of gold, sodium, yttrium,
fluorine, oxygen, carbon, and, in case of doped catalysts, gadolinium
elements (Figures S7–S11, Tables 2 and S1). The binding energy values were corrected
for surface charging by taking the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon
as a reference at 284.6 eV, as the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon
species or carbon from the PVA ligand are both located very close
to this value.16 The core-level spectra
in the Au 4f region show binding energies at 82.4–83.4 eV (Au
4f7/2), which can be assigned to metallic Au, as no peaks
because of the oxidized species, usually found at about 85.5 and 86.3
eV,17 were detected (Figure 4). These values show significant shifts toward
lower binding energies, as compared to the value for the bulk metallic
gold (84.0 eV), which is in accordance with the previous results by
Duo et al.18 Interestingly, we observed
a splitting of the characteristic Au 4f bands for gold deposited on
β-NaYF4 supports (Figure 4b,d), where the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 are both decomposed into two components. The prominent
bands, marked as 1 and 2 in Figure 4, should correspond to the core Au atoms, whereas the
bands with low intensities, designated as 3 and 4, are due to the
modified surface Au atoms bonded to the “O–C”
group at the Au–PVA interface.19 This indicates that, in particular cases where deposition of the
PVA-protected gold NPs took a longer time period, washing the sample
with water was not sufficient to remove the PVA ligand entirely.

2.2 Catalytic Activity of Au/NaYF4 Catalysts
To determine the potential of these nanometric
metal fluorides
as nonoxide supports for gold catalysts, the catalysts Au/α-NaYF4, Au/β-NaYF4, Au/α-NaYF4:Gd3+, and Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ were tested for the aerobic epoxidation of stilbene in methylcyclohexane
and CO and H2 oxidation in gas phase under the standard
conditions developed for these reactions.20,21 These two catalytic reactions are merely used as probes to highlight
the potentials of the synthesized metal fluorides as supports for
gold NPs, and the various catalytic behaviors observed are simply
discussed in the light of previous works.

2.2.1 Aerobic
Epoxidation of trans-Stilbene
As expected
for supported gold NPs with diameters
of about 5 nm, all of the catalysts described above show catalytic
activity in the aerobic epoxidation of trans-stilbene
in methylcyclohexane.22 The description
of the current understanding of the reaction mechanism can be found
elsewhere.23 With 92% conversion and 49%
epoxide yield after 100 h, Au/α-NaYF4 is the least
active catalyst of the series, which is consistent with the larger
size of the gold NPs (6.5 nm) in this catalyst. For all other catalysts,
namely Au/β-NaYF4, Au/α-NaYF4:Gd3+, and Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+, which
have an average gold particle size of ∼5 nm, full stilbene
conversion was achieved in 100 h, together with a trans-stilbene oxide yield of 54–63% (Figures 5 and 6). For these
catalysts, 40–47% of epoxide is readily formed within 48 h,
at 74–87% stilbene conversion. These values are either at par
(in terms of trans-stilbene oxide yield) or better
(in terms of stilbene conversion) than that for the World Gold Council
(WGC) reference catalyst Au/TiO2 for which 46% epoxide
is formed after 48 h at a conversion of 65%. These values are many
times more than the maximum 5% epoxide yield expected from the sole
action of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant/oxygen
donor for the alkene, thus indicating the involvement of molecular
oxygen from the air in the epoxidation process. The support itself
does not contribute to the high activities observed for these Au/NaYF4 catalysts, as α-NaYF4 alone yields only
a negligible amount of epoxide in 24 h. In all cases, epoxide is the
main product obtained in the aerobic process, along with some other
minor products such as benzaldehyde, deoxybenzoin, and benzil (less
than 5% of the total product). Two types of catalytic profiles were
observed: catalysts supported on the undoped NaYF4 show
an induction period, as observed previously on the Au/TiO2:Gd3+ and Au/Al4Ga2O9 catalysts.8,13 This can be attributed to a possible
conditioning of the catalyst in the reaction, for example, to a reaction
between the peroxide initiator and the catalyst surface.24 After conditioning, the epoxidation rates reach
0.018 and 0.032 mol gAu–1 h–1 in the case of Au/α-NaYF4 and Au/β-NaYF4 catalysts, respectively (Table 3). By taking into consideration the dispersion
of gold (Table 1),
which is determined from the volume/surface-weighted mean diameter d32 (also called the Sauter diameter) by mathematical
models assuming a cubo-octahedron geometry of the particle,25 the turnover frequencies (TOFs) are calculated
to be 27–34 h–1. These values are 1.7–1.8
times higher than those found during the initial induction period.
The maximum epoxidation rate observed (after the induction period)
for Au/β-NaYF4 is about 2 times higher than that
for Au/α-NaYF4, but is slightly lower than that observed
for the WGC reference catalyst Au/TiO2. In fact, this induction
period was not found when a second batch of trans-stilbene (1 mmol) was added after 90–95% conversion of the
first 1 mmol batch. The conversion of the second batch started just
after its addition and was fully converted at about the maximal rate
achieved during the transformation of the first batch, that is, 27–34
h–1. These experiments confirm the stability/durability
of the catalyst under these mild oxidative conditions. Gold particles
supported on two Gd3+-doped NaYF4, on the other
hand, do not display any induction period. Similar behavior was previously
observed for gold NPs supported on the group 13 homometallic oxides
M2O3 (M = Ga, In) or mesoporous structures.8,26 They are active from the beginning of the reaction, with the initial
epoxidation rates between 0.032 and 0.040 mol gAu–1 h–1, which correspond to the TOF of 31 to 39 h–1 (Table 3).

Despite
the relatively smaller surface area and somewhat larger
gold particles in these metal fluoride-supported catalysts (5–6.5
nm) than those found in the typical metal oxide-supported gold catalysts
(3–4 nm), the metal fluoride-supported catalysts described
here are less selective. However, unlike some of the metal oxide-supported
gold catalysts,8 the selectivity of these
catalysts remains stable throughout the reaction. With a selectivity
of 46% after 48 h, Au/α-NaYF4:Gd3+ was
the least selective catalyst in the series, others showing a selectivity
of 57–64%. Doping the support NaYF4 with Gd3+ not only eliminates the induction period but also enhances
the catalytic activity as indicated by larger TOF values. However,
the selectivity seems to be affected by this doping. This decrease
in selectivity in the two Gd3+-doped NaYF4 catalysts
is in contrast with the previous report where such doping caused an
enhancement in the selectivity of the Au/TiO2 catalyst.13 In particular, Au/α-NaYF4:Gd3+ exhibits an unusually high density of gold NPs on the surface
because of a high gold loading (0.94 wt %) and a low surface area
(11 m2/g). Hence, if selectivity is controlled by the support
surface chemistry, as suggested previously,27 and if selectivity is compromised by the reactions involving surface
hydroxyl groups, then a low ratio of −OH/Au NP is expected
to be favorable to selectivity by minimizing such parasitic reactions.
These results suggest that the support, in addition to controlling
the mass transfer, also plays a role in selectivity.

2.2.2 CO Oxidation
Since the discovery
of the astonishingly high catalytic efficiency shown by the supported
gold NPs for the oxidation of CO at low temperature,28 numerous studies on gold NPs deposited on metal oxide supports
have been pursued.2,4 However, there is still a debate
on (i) the influence of gold particle size and its charge state, (ii)
effect of support, and (iii) the nature of the active site, particularly
in what way and on which site O2 is activated. The general
consensus is that neutral gold particles alone cannot activate the
O–O bond without some assistance from the support in terms
of charge-transfer processes or involvement of specific sites at the
interface. Until now, only a few reports on the catalytic studies
of gold NPs on nonoxide supports such as carbon or carbon nitride
materials have appeared, and none of them showed any appreciable catalytic
activity for the oxidation reactions.29,30 This low activity
has been attributed to the lack of basic surface OH groups.30

To study the behavior of “nonoxide
support”-based gold catalysts toward CO oxidation reactions
in gas phase, we tested these Au/NaYF4 catalysts for three
catalytic reactions, that is, (i) oxidation of CO, (ii) selective
oxidation of CO promoted by H2, and (iii) oxidation of
H2. Except for the change in the incoming gas mixture,
the same protocol was used for these reactions. The catalytic tests
were carried out in a flow reactor at temperatures from 25 to 250
°C under atmospheric pressure using 50 N mL min–1 total flow of reactants in helium carrier gas. Several reaction
cycles, each consisting of alternative heating and cooling periods,
were recorded to monitor possible hysteresis, deactivation, or activation.
For all samples, the results of the first run were significantly different
from those of the subsequent cycles. This is illustrated in Figure 7 for CO oxidation
on the Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ catalyst. These
catalysts apparently need a thermal activation, probably because of
the inhibitory effect of the capping ligand (PVA) that is still present
around the catalyst, as shown by XPS results. However, the data obtained
on the second and third run were similar, indicating that organic
species were eliminated during the first heating cycle and that the
catalyst was now stable under the reaction conditions used. Indeed,
it has been shown previously that calcination at 250 °C removes
the PVA ligand from the PVA-protected gold NPs.31 It should be noted that the two phases of the support itself
(i.e., α- and β-NaYF4 without any gold NPs)
do not show any measurable catalytic activity (Figures 7 and 8).

Figure 7 CO conversion
as a function of temperature over the β-NaYF4 support
and the Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ catalyst during
the first and second cooling runs in CO oxidation
(H2-free mixture).

Figure 8 CO and H2 conversion as a function of temperature over
the β-NaYF4 support and the Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ catalyst in a H2-free mixture (2% CO
+ 2% O2 + 96% He), PrOx mixture (2% CO + 48% H2 + 2% O2 + 48% He), and CO-free mixture (48% H2 + 2% O2 + 50% He). All percentages are vol %.

For the sake of clarity and brevity, only the data
corresponding
to the second cooling steps are plotted and used for ensuing discussion.
In Figure 8, the activity
of Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ as a function of temperatures
is displayed. In the absence of H2, oxidation of CO proceeds
via a difficult O2 dissociation step and, therefore, the
oxidation rate observed is very low (4% CO conversion at 250 °C).
The corresponding calculated rate per surface atom (TOF) is about
3 orders of magnitude lower than those observed for the usual metal
oxide-supported gold NPs (e.g., Au/TiO2 or Au/Fe2O3 reference catalysts). In the course of our previous
investigation of PrOx (preferential oxidation) reaction on supported
gold catalysts, we focused on the effect of H2 addition
on CO oxidation and demonstrated that the CO oxidation pathway was
significantly altered in the presence of H2.32 Indeed, even a low H2 amount added
to a CO + O2 feed accelerated the CO oxidation. In the
present study also, the introduction of hydrogen in the reactant feed
results in an increase of the CO oxidation rate, as observed previously
over the unsupported or alumina-supported gold catalysts.33

In the present case, the PrOx reaction
proceeds with the highest
selectivity toward CO at low temperature (nearly no water is formed
up to 60 °C). This shows that the O2 activation step,
which is rate-determining in the CO–O2 mixtures,
is facilitated in PrOx mixtures, irrespective of whether the gold
catalyst is unsupported or supported on oxide or “nonoxide”
materials. As the temperature increases, hydrogen also commences to
be oxidized to form water and, therefore, starts competing with CO
for the reaction with oxygen. From our previous work on CO oxidation
and PrOx,32,33 it becomes clear that gold-catalyzed CO
oxidation reactions advance in different ways depending on whether
hydrogen is present in the feed or not. The presence of hydrogen accelerates
CO oxidation, which suggests the involvement of different reactive
species and, therefore, change in the kinetics and mechanism of the
reaction. We have previously suggested the gold–hydroperoxy
(Au–OOH) species as the critical oxidizing species and proposed
a comprehensive mechanism where the molecularly adsorbed O2 on Au is activated by H2 to form OOH and H species.34 This mechanism does not require O2 dissociation on Au, which is known to be a highly activated step.
Hence, introducing H2 in a CO + O2 mixture opens
channels that cause O2 to hydrogenate and dissociate thus
easily to provide O for CO oxidation.

The behavior of the three
other gold catalysts was very similar
to the one that we described above and, therefore, will not be commented
upon in detail. The TOF values of the four catalysts in the complete
temperature range for CO conversion in PrOx conditions are reported
in Figure 9. While
comparing the activities of the different catalysts at low temperature
(in the H2 environment and temperature above 80 °C,
water begins to form which competes with the conversion of CO), it
becomes clear that the activity of the gold NPs is directly affected
by the nature of the support. The following observations can be made:
The doped catalysts Au/α-NaYF4:Gd3+ and
Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ are nearly equal and superior
to the Au/β-NaYF4 catalyst which, in turn, is better
than the Au/α-NaYF4 catalyst. However, one has to
note that even the highest value of TOF for these nonoxide-supported
catalysts (∼0.027 s–1 for Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ at 210 °C) is once again low as compared
to those shown by efficient metal oxide-supported gold NPs. These
turnover values are of the same order of magnitude as those obtained
on both unsupported or nanoporous gold powders in the presence of
H2.33,34 The fact that these catalysts
can be used for several reaction cycles without showing much difference
in their reactivity underlines their stability and durability. As
mentioned earlier, the activity of these catalysts enhanced after
the first run, apparently because of the combustion of the inhibitory
capping ligand PVA during the first heating cycle. In subsequent cycles,
these catalysts showed almost similar reactivity. These catalysts
did not show any appreciable change in the morphology of the support,
though the mean diameters of the Au particles were found to be slightly
larger in comparison to the fresh catalysts (Figures S12 and S13). Generally speaking,
as compared to the methods employing reduction of grafted gold species
to prepare the gold catalysts, the colloidal deposition method used
here is expected to generate less strong interaction between the gold
NPs and the support because this interaction is generated after the
formation of Au NPs and, therefore, might lack strong covalent/ionic
bonds. Nonetheless, the above observations on the morphology and the
average gold particle size indicate that the Au–support interaction
in the catalysts reported here is adequately strong to resist reasonably
the floating and sintering of Au NPs when treated at an elevated temperature.

Figure 9 CO2 production in TOF vs temperature over the four catalysts
in the preferential oxidation of CO (PrOx: 2% CO + 2% O2 + 48% H2 + 48% He).

In conclusion, the metal fluoride-supported gold catalysts
behaved
on expected lines and exhibited a poor activity toward CO oxidation
as compared to the gold catalysts supported on reducible metal oxides.
The present study, however, confirmed the previous observation about
a new way of CO oxidation being opened up in the presence of hydrogen.
However, even with hydrogen, these gold catalysts on metal fluoride
are found to be less efficient for activating oxygen than those supported
on metal oxides.

3 Conclusions
Metal
fluorides are evaluated as potential supports for gold catalysts.
Using SSPs in a metal–organic decomposition process, NPs of
two different crystalline phases of NaYF4, namely α-
and β-phases showing different surface characteristics, were
prepared. The deposition of about 5 nm gold NPs on these heterometal
fluorides, either undoped or doped with Gd3+ ions, generates
efficient catalysts Au/α-NaYF4, Au/β-NaYF4, Au/α-NaYF4:Gd3+, and Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ for the aerobic oxidation of trans-stilbene. These catalysts are either at par (in terms of the trans-stilbene oxide yield) or better (in terms of stilbene
conversion) than the WGC reference catalyst Au/TiO2. Doping
the support NaYF4 with Gd3+ eliminates the induction
period and also enhances the catalytic activity, as indicated by larger
TOF values, but decreases the selectivity. These results indicate
that the composition and chemical nature of the support have little
effect on the intrinsic epoxidation activity of the catalyst but rather
influence the overall reactivity patterns via mass-transfer limitations.
In contrast to the above epoxidation activity, these catalysts show
poor activity for CO oxidation reactions, which can be accelerated
to an extent by the presence of hydrogen. However, the overall activity
of these metal fluoride-supported gold catalysts toward CO oxidation
reactions remains less than those supported on metal oxides.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Procedures
All manipulations
were carried out in an argon atmosphere using a Schlenk tube and vacuum
line techniques. The purification of the solvents was achieved on
an MB SPS-800 instrument. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra
were recorded as KBr pellets on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer. SSPs
[NaLn(TFA)4(diglyme)] (Ln = Y, Gd) were prepared as described
in our previous publications.12 Powder
XRD data were obtained with a Siemens D 5000 diffractometer using
Cu Kα radiation. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were obtained on an ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics) after desorbing
the samples at 400 °C for 3 h. The TG–DTA data for the
as-prepared NaYF4 NPs were recorded in air on a Setaram
92 system in the temperature range 20–900 °C with a thermal
ramp of 5 °C min–1. TEM was performed on a
JEOL JEM-2010 LaB6 microscope operated at 200 kV. The XPS analyses
were carried out in a Kratos Ultra DLD spectrometer using a monochromatic
Al Kα radiation [Ehν (Al Kα) =
1486.6 eV (10 mA, 15 kV)] as the photon source. Survey scans were
conducted in the binding energies between 1200 eV and 0 using a 1
eV step size, dwell time of 100 ms per step, and an analyser pass
energy of 160 eV for all samples. All spectra were obtained at room
temperature in the hybrid mode (combined electrostatic and magnetic
lens) under ultrahigh vacuum (1 × 10–9 torr).
The specific region photoelectron peaks, viz. O 1s, C 1s, F 1s, Na
1s, Y 3d, Gd 4d, Au 4f, and Si 2p, were scanned over an energy range
of 20 eV with 0.1 eV step size. All photoelectron peaks were background-subtracted
using a Shirley background and curve-fitted in the same manner, that
is, a Lorentzian-to-Gaussian ratio of 30%. All spectra were then calibrated
using the adventitious C 1s contaminant peak at 284.6 eV. Quantification
was carried out with the VISION software supplied. The Au and Gd contents
were determined by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission
spectroscopy. The reference catalyst Au/TiO2-WGC, purchased
from WGC, was treated at 250 °C for 2 h in air before use. This
treatment did not change its physicochemical properties (average Au
diameter = 3.5 ± 0.9 nm, Au loading = 1.5 wt %).

4.2 Preparation of Cubic (α) and Hexagonal
(β) Phases of NaYF4 and NaYF4:Gd3+ NPs
A typical method of obtaining α-NaYF4 NPs involved taking the precursor [NaY(TFA)4(diglyme)]
in 1-octadecene (10 mL) and heating gradually at a rate of 10 °C/min
in an inert atmosphere. After keeping at 250 °C for 1 h, the
reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, and the
NPs were then precipitated by adding ethanol and isolated via centrifugation.
The obtained NPs were then washed two times by dispersing in ethanol,
centrifugated, and dried at 70 °C (24 h). To obtain the α-NaYF4 NPs doped with Gd3+, the isostructural precursors
[NaY(TFA)4(diglyme)] and [NaGd(TFA)4(diglyme)]
were taken in about 20:1 ratio in 1-octadecene and then decomposed
simultaneously.

When the above decomposition was carried out
at the boiling temperature of 1-octadecene (i.e., 315 °C), it
afforded NaYF4 NPs with the mixed α- and β-phases,
the latter phase being in the majority. These mixed-phase (α/β)-NaYF4 and (α/β)-NaYF4:Gd3+ NPs
were calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in air to obtain the phase-pure
β-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4:Gd3+ NPs, respectively.

4.3 Colloidal Gold Deposition
Au/α-NaYF4, Au/β-NaYF4, Au/α-NaYF4:Gd3+, and Au/β-NaYF4:Gd3+ were prepared by colloidal deposition of gold over a suitable metal
fluoride support, using 0.2 mL of a HAuCl4 solution (0.25
mol L–1) taken in 100 mL of deionized water, 1.3
mL of PVA solution (0.5 wt %, obtained by diluting PVA MW 10 000
in deionized water), 2.5 mL of a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (0.1 mol L–1), and 1 g of metal fluoride
support.13 The as-obtained brownish to
reddish catalysts were repeatedly washed with deionized water (1 L)
as well as with ethanol and dried in air at 100 °C overnight.
Gold loading was found in the range 0.72–0.94% by weight. The
mean diameter for Au NPs, on the size distributions obtained from
the TEM images, was in the range 5–6.5 nm. The gold dispersion
was calculated via the determination of the volume/surface-weighted
mean diameter d32, also called the Sauter
diameter. It was calculated from the particle size distribution histograms
by the expression (eq 1) 1  

One can relate the volume/surface-weighted
mean diameter d32 to the dispersion D, which is the ratio of the number of surface atoms to
the total number of atoms in the particle, by (eq 2) 2  where M = atomic mass, NA = Avogadro number, ρ = mass density
of the particle, and a = surface area occupied by
an atom on the particle surface.35a = 8.17 Å2 for gold if one assumes equal
proportions of the (111), (100), and (110) planes on the particle
surface of this face-centered cubic metal.

4.4 Catalytic
Evaluation
4.4.1 Aerobic Epoxidation of trans-Stilbene
Catalytic evaluation was studied in round-bottom
flasks where trans-stilbene (1 mmol), the gold catalyst
(Au: 2.1 ± 0.1 μmol), and an organic initiator (0.05 mmol/7
μL of a 70% TBHP in water Aldrich solution) were added to the
solvent methylcyclohexane (20 mL/155 mmol) and stirred together (900
rpm) at 80 °C for over 60 h in air and at atmospheric pressure.
The products resulting from the oxidation of stilbene were analyzed
by high-performance liquid chromatography (PerkinElmer HPLC Series
200), using a Spheri-5 RP-18 220 mm × 4.6 mm × 3 μm
C18 reverse-phase column, an acetonitrile/water mobile-phase mixture
at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL min–1 and a Series
200 UV detector set at 250 nm. External calibration was carried out
by injecting standard solutions of trans-stilbene
(96% Sigma-Aldrich) and trans-stilbene oxide (99%
Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile. Conversion, yield, selectivity, and
TOFs are defined and calculated as explained in ref (13).

4.4.2 CO
Oxidation
Using the same protocol,
the catalysts were tested in three related reactions, the oxidation
of CO (H2-free), the selective oxidation of CO in the presence
of H2 (PrOx), and the oxidation of H2 (CO-free).
The tests were carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor
at atmospheric pressure. About 30 mg (between 10 and 45 mg) of the
as-prepared material was loaded into a tube reactor in quartz (inner
diameter = 3 mm), located in a ceramic furnace. No pretreatment was
applied. The reactant flow consisted of a mixture of 2% CO + 2% O2 + 96% He for the oxidation of CO, 2% CO + 2% O2 + 48% H2 + 48% He for the preferential oxidation of CO
(PrOx), and 48% H2 + 2% O2 + 50% He for the
oxidation of H2 (all percentages are vol %). All the high-purity
(>99.995%) gases were purchased from Air Liquide. Feed mixtures
were
generated at a typical flow rate of 50 N mL  min–1 using mass-flow controllers (Brooks). The reactor was heated to
250 °C and then cooled to 25 °C at a heating (and cooling)
rate of 1 °C min–1. We carried out the product
analysis online with a Varian-Micro GC (CP2003) equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector.32a
