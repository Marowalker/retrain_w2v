The intrinsically fluorescent highly
hydrophilic multifunctional
aliphatic terpolymer, maleic acid (MA)-co-2-(N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamido)succinic acid (NHASA)-co-N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide (NHMA),
that is, 1, was designed and synthesized via C–C/N–C-coupled
in situ allocation of a fluorophore monomer, that is, NHASA, composed
of amido and carboxylic acid functionalities in the polymerization
of two nonemissive MA and NHMA. The scalable and reusable intrinsically
fluorescent biocompatible 1 was suitable for sensing
and high-performance adsorptive exclusion of Fe(III), along with the
imaging of Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. The structure of 1, in situ fluorophore monomer, aggregation-induced enhanced
emission, cell-imaging ability, and superadsorption mechanism were
studied via microstructural analyses using 1H/13C NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic light scattering,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, solid-state fluorescence,
fluorescence lifetime, and fluorescence imaging, along with measuring
kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamic parameters. The location, electronic
structures, and geometries of the fluorophore and absorption and emission
properties of 1 were investigated using density functional
theory and natural transition orbital analyses. The limit of detection
and the maximum adsorption capacity were 2.45 × 10–7 M and 542.81 mg g–1, respectively.

Introduction
Recently, nonconventional
intrinsically fluorescent biocompatible
multifunctional multipolymers are of huge demand in sensing, removal,
and biomedical applications. Additionally, the fluorescent polymers
are employed for cellular imaging,1 DNA
probing,2 biosensing,3 data security,4 and drug delivery.5 Earlier, although few nonconventional luminescent
polymers have been reported,6 to date,
a purely aliphatic intrinsically fluorescent multifunctional polymer
bearing a branched tertiary amide fluorophore is scarcely reported.7 Therefore, we designed the synthesis of a nonconventional
intrinsically fluorescent multifunctional terpolymer through multi
C–C/N–C-coupled solution polymerization in an aqueous
environment, wherein the fluorophore monomer, that is, third monomer,
was attached in situ via N–H functionalization.

Usually,
amides emit clusteroluminescence, if a lone pair (n) of one carbonyl group interpenetrates the empty π*
of another carbonyl.8 Moreover, extensive
hydrogen bonding-driven closer association among the amide functionalities
plays significant roles in elevating the fluorescence phenomena.7,9 Additionally, the branching units of the terpolymer bearing frequent
aliphatic tertiary amides are expected to introduce the rigidity,
leading to the high-performance nonconventional intrinsic fluorescence
from purely aliphatic multipolymers.

For the precise detection
of fluorophores and aggregation-induced
enhanced emission (AIEE) in the polymer, density functional theory
(DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) are employed for measuring geometrical
parameters and simulated absorption-emission properties, respectively.10 However, for the exact determination of fluorophore(s)
and associated in depth analyses of the luminescent phenomena, natural
transition orbitals (NTOs) are computed from the equilibrium geometry
of S1/S2 and S1/S2 →
S0 transitions from occupied NTOs (hole) to unoccupied
NTOs (electron).11 In general, strong blue/green
emissions from polymers are substantiated by evaluating the hole–electron
wave function overlap (σhe) and separations (Δr) between holes and electrons.12

Being an essential trace element of many enzymes and proteins,
iron envisages major roles in metabolism and oxygen uptake. It is
worth mentioning that although moderate concentration of Fe(III) is
essential in living systems, the deficiency or overloading causes
biological disorders including hepatic cirrhosis; endotoxemia; hereditary
hemochromatosis; and Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s
diseases.13 Thus, sensing and removal of
Fe(III) are essential for the protection of human health, ecology,
and environment. Importantly, Fe(III) imparts the quenching effect
on fluorophores via paramagnetic quenching mechanism(s).14 Of the available methods for Fe(III) sensing,
fluorescence spectroscopy is the smarter detection tool equipped with
high sensitivity and selectivity, short response time, low detection
limit, and low-cost.15 Earlier, maleic
acid containing biocompatible copolymers have been reported for preliminary
studies of hepatic cells16 and hemoglobin.17 Introduction of extra carboxylic acid functionality
is expected to enrich the affinity toward protein and pH-responsive
nature of the polymer.17

Though chemical
oxidation, ion-exchange, biological treatment,
adsorption,18 photocatalytic degradation,
precipitation,19 ion exchange,20 membrane-based separation,21 electro-deposition,22 complexation,23 and reverse osmosis24 have been employed for effective removal(s) of M(II/III), dyes,
and organics for water decontamination, adsorption is widely employed
because of availability, cost-effectiveness, and high efficiency of
variable adsorbents.25

Notably, fluorescent
probes,26 nano
particles (NPs),27 protein-based polymers,28 and NP-functionalized conjugated polymers29 have been employed in cell imaging. In this
regard, the reported examples are mostly limited to conjugated polymers
devoid of the biocompatible functionalities. Importantly, intrinsically
fluorescent aliphatic polymers comprising amide functionalities are
highly encouraged in imaging and biomedical applications. Thus, 1 is expected to interact sufficiently with cells in high-contrast
imaging.

The nonconventional purely aliphatic intrinsically
fluorescent
multifunctional terpolymer has been synthesized employing two nonemissive
monomers and N–H-functionalized C–C/N–C-coupled
in situ attachment of a fluorescent tertiary amide monomer for three-in-one
applications, such as Fe(III) sensing, high-performance removal of
Fe(III), and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell imaging.
The high-performance Fe(III) sensing and exclusion of Fe(III) have
been attempted synthesizing 1 via in situ protrusion
of the acrylamido-succinic acid monomer and selecting maleic acid,
that is, unsaturated di-carboxylic acid, as one of the ex situ monomers.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of the Fluorescent Terpolymer
The fluorescent
terpolymer was synthesized via solution polymerization involving NHMA
+ MA in water (Scheme 1). Initially, in a three-neck reactor, MA and NHMA were mixed, followed
by the addition of N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide
(MBA). Thereafter, the solution polymerization in water was initiated
via slow additions of potassium persulfate (PPS) + sodium bisulfite
(SBS) initiators. The as-synthesized terpolymer (Scheme 1) was swelled in 1:3 (v/v)
methanol/water for removing unreacted monomers, oligomers, and other
components, followed by drying in a vacuum oven for 24 h.

Characterization of the
Fluorescent Terpolymer
The
structure of 1 formed via multi C–C/N–C-coupled
polymerization was confirmed from −CH2–/>CH–
peaks within 0.85–3.02 and 28.00–42.50 ppm in 1H and 13C NMR, respectively (Figure 1a,b). The protrusion of MA in 1 was confirmed from the −COOH
peak at 183 ppm, supported from the 1H NMR peak of −COOH at 9.74 ppm. In 1, NHMA was
confirmed from −CONH–CH2OH and −CONH–CH2OH peaks at 5.72 and 64.20 ppm, respectively. Most importantly,
the in situ attachment of the tertiary amide fluorophore monomer,
that is, NHASA, was inferred from −CON(−CH2OH)–CH< and −CON(−CH2OH)–CH< peaks at
4.8430 and 69.90 ppm, respectively (Figure 1a,b).

Figure 1 (a) 1H NMR
spectrum, (b) 13C NMR spectrum,
and (c) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of 1 and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of (d) N 1s,
(e) O 1s, and (f) C 1s for 1.

In FTIR, the protrusions of MA and NHMA in 1 were
confirmed from −COO– asym. str. of MA at
1655/1622 cm–1, along with −CH2–O def. and hydrogen-bonded O–H def. of NHMA at 1016
and 1396 cm–1, respectively (Figure 1c and Table S1). Importantly, the in situ attached NHASA confirmed earlier in NMR
analyses was supported by C–N–C asym. str. of tertiary
amides at 861 cm–1 (Figure 1c).

In this regard, the in situ attachment
of NHASA and ex situ added
MA and NHMA were confirmed from N 1s, O 1s, and C 1s binding energies
(BEs) in XPS of 1 (Figure 1d–f and Table S2).
The coexistences of secondary and tertiary amides in 1 were realized from N 1s BEs of −CON< and −CONH–
functionalities at 398.73 and 399.30 eV, respectively (Figure 1d). Additionally, in 1, >C=O, >COO–, and −OH were confirmed from BEs at 530.35, 531.24, and
531.88 eV,
respectively (Figure 1e). In this regard, −CH3/–CH2–/–CH<, C–N/C–OH/C–O, and −CONH–/–CON</>C=O
were confirmed from BEs at 283.78, 284.73, and 286.74 eV, respectively
(Figure 1f).

From thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of 1, moisture
loss from hydrophilic functionalities was completed within 150 °C.
Thereafter, 12 wt % loss within 151–300 °C was ascribed
to the removal of water molecules from closely pendent dicarboxylic
acid moieties in 1, forming cyclic anhydrides (Figure S1).The accelerated degradation beyond
300 °C could be related to the decomposition of remaining carboxylate
functionalities of 1. Beyond 390 °C, the decompositions
of anhydride rings and backbone of 1 superimposed. In
fact, the overall thermal degradation of 1 completed
at 540 °C resulting in the 3 wt % residue in the thermogram.
Thus, the in situ attached aliphatic amide-fluorophore and associated
branching and clusters formed via elevated hydrogen bonding encouraged
the intrinsic fluorescence of 1. However, the in situ
protruded tertiary amide fluorophore monomer, that is, NHASA, imparted
rigid terpolymer networks, causing enriched photophysical properties.

Photophysical Studies
For 1, the absorption
and emission spectra were recorded in solvents of variable polarities.
Herein, the absorption peaks at 241, 257, and 203 nm in CHCl3, DMSO, and CH3OH, respectively, appeared via π
→ π* transitions (Figure 2a). The broad shoulders at 274, 276, and 222 nm in
CHCl3, DMSO, and CH3OH, respectively, originated
via n → π* transitions (Figure 2a). Additionally, the emission
peaks of 1 appeared at 430, 434, and 424 nm in CHCl3, DMSO, and CH3OH, respectively (Figure 2b). In the emission spectra,
bathochromic shifts in more polar solvents were attributed to the
gradual drop of energy differences between excited and ground states.
Importantly, the emission maxima appeared at a lower wavelength in
MeOH compared to DMSO of greater polarity. Thus, polarity merely cannot
account for the weak solvatochromic ability of 1. In
this regard, the extent of hydrogen bonding definitely plays a leading
role in the photophysics of 1 in the polar protic solvent.
In the fluorescence spectra of 1, λem remained unchanged at λex = 300, 320, 340, 360,
380, and 400 nm. Herein, the intensities varied with the λex, and the maximum intensity was observed at 380 nm (Figure 2c). The fluorescence
intensities of 1 in CHCl3 and DMSO dropped
gently via gradual decrease in concentrations (Figure 2d,e). Though the additions of DMSO in 1 + DMSO solutions gently decreased the fluorescence intensities,
the intensities elevated rapidly by increasing water volume fractions
(Figure 2f). Herein,
the aggregation of 1 created the rigid structure through
restrained molecular motions. In this regard, the higher volume fractions
of more polar water decreased the solubilities of 1 in
DMSO + water, as solubility of 1 was higher in less polar
DMSO compared to water. The emission-maximum was noted at 16:84 (v/v)
water/DMSO solution. The fluorescence intensities diminished upon
further additions of water into the 1 + DMSO solutions.
The extents of aggregations, that is, sizes/orders of aggregates,
in DMSO + water solutions were measured by the dynamic light scattering
(DLS), substantiated from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) photomicrographs (Figure 2g,h). The intensity average hydrodynamic diameters,
that is, Dh, of 1 in solutions
increased from 239 to 317 nm (Figure 2g). Additionally, the effects of external stimuli,
such as pH and temperature, on the photophysics of 1 were
studied, from which the fluorescence intensities decreased slightly
with increasing temperatures (Figure S2a). In contrast, the intensities increased significantly with increasing
pH from 2.0 to 12.0 (Figure S2b). Additionally,
the average lifetimes of 1 in CHCl3 and DMSO
were calculated as 0.98 and 1.0 ns, respectively (Figure 2i). In the solid state, the
intense blue and green fluorescence of 1 was confirmed
from fluorescence imaging recorded through DAPI (i.e., 461 nm) and
FITC (i.e., 519 nm) channels, respectively (Figure S2c,d), related to intra- and inter-chain n···π
interactions of fluorophores.31

Computational Studies
The geometries
of ground-state
(S0), first excited-state (S1), and geometrical
parameters of 1 were envisaged in Figure 3a. The excitation from S0 to S1 resulted in the noticeable changes in bond lengths and bond
angles in two positions of the in situ attached NHASA moiety. The
amidic >C=O length of the NHASA moiety increased from 1.23
Å in S0 to 1.40 Å in S1. Additionally,
the amidic C–N length of NHASA increased from 1.38 Å in
S0 to 1.42 Å in S1. Additionally, the changes
in O–Ĉ–N and C–Ĉ–O from
119 and 117° in S0 to 111 and 112° in S1, respectively, supported planar to pyramidal structural alteration
of the amide-carbonyl center of NHASA (Figure 3a). Notably, in S0/S1 of 1, hydrogen bond lengths between −NHCH2OH and >CH2COOH were measured within 1.94–1.97
Å, signifying marginal deviation from the Franck–Condon
principle. Herein, the strong emissive nature of 1 was
confirmed from the decrease in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, that
is, H–L, from 14.31 eV in S0 to 12.84 eV in S1 via stabilization and destabilization of lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO),
respectively (Figure 3b and Table S3). Additionally, the absorption
characteristics of 1 were determined from TDDFT using
optimized ground-state geometry (Figure S3a and Table S4). For 1, the
lowest energy absorption at 202 nm located in the close proximity
of the experimental band within 228–280 nm, originated through
the electronic excitation from H – 3 to L, for which the oscillator
strength (f) was 0.0047. Additionally, the lowest
energy emission band at 401 nm prevailed in the close proximity of
the experimental band within 416–435 nm, originated from the
transition from H – 1 to LUMO, for which f was 0.0029 (Figure S3b and Table S5). Notably, both nonbonding and antibonding
orbitals were delocalized on the newly attached NHASA moiety. The
hole–electron wave function overlap, that is, σhe, and the separation between the centroids of hole and electron distribution,
that is, Δr, for the lowest singlet states
were calculated using NTO analysis based on the singular value decomposition
of the 1-particle transition density matrix.32 For 1, σhe and Δr were 0.058 and 1.315 Å for S1 and 0.231 and 4.120
Å for S2 (Figure 3c), in which smaller σhe and larger
Δr substantiated the stronger charge-transfer
ability of 1.

Turn-Off Fe(III) Sensor
The binding affinities of 1 with metal ions, such as K+, Ag(I), Ca(II), Cu(II),
Fe(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Sb(III),
and Bi(III), were explored at 298 K and pH within 7.0–8.0.
Herein, 1 was excited at 320 nm, and the emission was
recorded within 340–600 nm employing 5 and 8 nm slit-widths
for the source and detector, respectively. In the fluorescence titration,
2.0 × 10–4 M metal ions were added each time
in a quartz cuvette containing 2.6 mL 80–100 μg mL–11 in 6:1 (v/v) DMSO/H2O (Figure 4a). From the results,
the fluorescence quenching efficiency (η) was calculated using eq 1.33 1  

Figure 4 (a) Relative intensities of 1 in
the presence of M(I/II/III),
(b) fluorescence titration of 1 with Fe(III), (c) variation
of I0/I with Fe(III),
and (d) Stern–Volmer (SV) fitting of Fe(III)-1.

Importantly, only Fe(III) envisaged
the maximum fluorescence quenching
over other metal ions (Figure 4a), confirmed from the additions of 25.0 × 10–4 M metal ions each to the solutions of 1 + DMSO/H2O. In this regard, the decrease in fluorescence intensities
via incremental additions of Fe(III) into solution of 1 confirmed the stable complexation of Fe(III) with 1 (Figure 4b). The
addition of 2.65 × 10–3 M Fe(III) in solution
of 1 quenched the fluorescence intensity to 98.07%, whereas
for other metal ions, the quenching efficiencies were measured within
0–63%. Herein, the time required for quenching was noted within
1 s. At low Fe(III) concentrations, the linear nature of quenching
(Figure 4b–d)
and the elevated quenching at higher Fe(III) concentrations indicated
static or static + dynamic quenching mechanism in the turn-off Fe(III)
sensing of 1.34 Additionally,
at low Fe(III) concentrations, the static quenching at the ground
state of the Fe(III)-1 complex was confirmed from UV–vis
analyses (Figure 5a),
inferred from unaltered fluorescence lifetimes of the Fe(III)-1 complex (Figure 5b). In contrast, alterations of lifetimes at higher Fe(III)
concentrations confirmed the static + dynamic quenching mechanism
in the turn-off Fe(III) sensing of 1 (Figure 5c). The SV quenching constant
(KSV), that is, 2.22 × 103 M–1, confirmed the greater binding affinity of 1 with Fe(III) (Figure 4d). From the fluorescence titration plot using 0–4
μM Fe(III), the limit of detection (LOD) was 2.45 × 10–7 M (S/N = 3) (Figure 5d), which was much lesser compared to the values reported
to date.35

Adsorption Isotherms, Kinetics, and Thermodynamics
The equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to three different
isotherm
models, that is, Langmuir, Freundlich, and BET (eqs 2–4), of which
Langmuir model (Figure 6a) fitted the best (Table 1). In low ppm, photophysical studies envisaged the highest
binding affinity of 1 with Fe(III). Importantly, even
in high ppm, the excellent removal efficiency was further confirmed
from the very high qmax of 1, that is, 542.81 mg g–1. The higher binding affinity
of Fe(III) with O-donor ligands resulted in the elevated qmax. The adsorption of Fe(III) was spontaneous as a separation
factor, that is, RL (eq 5), varies from 0 to 1. 2   3   4  Here, qmax, n, and qBET and kL, kF, k1, and k2 are isotherm parameters
and isotherm constants, respectively. 5

Additionally, the adsorption
data were fitted to pseudo-first-
and pseudo-second-order kinetics models (Figure 6b and Table 1), of which the better fitting of the pseudosecond-order
kinetics equation (eq 7) compared to pseudofirst-order kinetics equation (eq 6) supported the chemical attachment
of Fe(III) with 1 (Table 1) via ionic and coordinative interactions between Fe(III)
and O-donor functionalities, that is, −COOH and −COO–.36 In this regard, from
the temperature-dependent Arrhenius equation (eq 8), the activation energy (Ea) of adsorption was 22.49 kJ mol–1,
supported the prevalence of chemisorption (Figure 6c).37 The spontaneity
of the chemisorption was understood from −ΔG0 data (eq 9). 6   7   8   9  

The distribution coefficient (kd) is
defined as the ratio of Fe(III) concentrations in solid to liquid
phases at equilibrium (eq 10). 10   11  

The exothermic nature of adsorption was realized from the
negative
ΔH0 (Table 2) calculated using equation (eq 11), whereas the positive ΔS0 suggested a fair binding affinity of Fe(III)
with 1 (Figure 6d).

Characterization
of Fe(III)-1
From Figure 7a, substantial alterations
in characteristic −COO– asym. str. and −COO– sym. str. were observed in Fe(III)-1.
The −COO– asym. str. and −COO– sym. str. peaks appeared at 1655/1622 and 1458/1396
cm–1 in 1 shifted to 1649 and 1450/1382
cm–1 in Fe(III)-1, respectively. Importantly,
substantial enrichment of −COO– functionality,
that is, O-donor, in Fe(III)-1 was ascribed to the increase
in intensity of −COO– sym. str. at 1450 cm–1, supported from the disappearance of O–H def.
of −COOH at 1364 cm–1 in 1.
Additionally, the mutual O–H···N–H hydrogen-bonding
peak at 3283 cm–1 reduced substantially in Fe(III)-1, inferring the conversion of −COOH to −COO–. Additionally, participation of amide functionalities
in complexation was confirmed from peaks of >NH+–
and >C=NH+– at 1981, 2052, 2162, 2287,
and
2323 cm–1, along with the disappearance of C–N–C
asym. str. of −CON< at 861 cm–1, inferred
from −C(O–)=N+< BE at 400.92 eV in XPS (Figure 7b). The weak ionic binding
affinity of Fe(III) with amide functionalities was realized from the
marginal increase in N 1s BE from 398.73/399.30 eV in 1 to 398.92/399.51 eV in Fe(III)-1 (Figures 1d and 7b). However, the intimate coordinate bonding of the O-donor with
Fe(III) was realized from the significant increase in O1s BEs of >C=O, −COO–, and O–H
from 530.35, 531.24, and 531.88 to 530.75, 531.85, and 532.66 eV (Figures 1e and 7c). The binding through −COO–, −CONH–, and −CON< functionalities
decreased the electron density around the C-center, substantiated
through the increase in BEs from 283.78, 284.73, and 286.74 eV in 1 to 284.27, 285.29, and 287.16 eV in Fe(III)-1 (Figures 1f and 7d). Additionally, the interaction of 1 with Fe(III) was realized from TG analysis, in which elevated thermal
stability of Fe(III)-1 compared to 1 within
151–390 °C envisaged astricted anhydride formation in
the presence of Fe(III) ions. Beyond 390 °C, the lesser thermal
stability of Fe(III)-1 compared to 1 was
related to the absence of cyclic anhydrides. Thus, a sharp degradation
continued up to 490 °C resulted in 24 wt % residue of Fe(III)
salts, correlating the higher AC, that is, 542.81 mg g–1 (Figure 7e).

N 1s, (c) O 1s, and (d) C 1s for Fe(III)-1, and (e) TG
analyses of 1 and Fe(III)-1.

Cell Viability and Cell Imaging
From the MTT assay, 1 was noncytotoxic on the MDCK cell, substantiated from p < 0.05 for the cells treated with 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and
1.5 μg μL–1 solutions of 1 (Figure 8a,b). Additionally, 1 was biocompatible, as more than 95% MDCK cells continued
to have the cell morphologies (Figure 8a). For fluorescence imaging, the MDCK cell was naturally
developed on a poly l-lysine-coated coverslip for proper seeding. Thereafter,
the seeded cells were treated with 0.2 μg μL–11 and incubated for 50 min at 37 °C. These cells
were fixed with 4:96 (v/v) paraformaldehyde/water for 2 h at 37 °C
followed by washing in 1× PBS three times. The fluorescence imaging
of both control and treated cells was measured through DAPI (i.e.,
461 nm) and FITC (i.e., 519 nm) channels and mounting the cell on
a glass slide (Figure 8c–f). The cell and nuclear membrane permeabilities of intrinsically
fluorescent-1 and the retention of cell morphologies
confirmed the suitability of 1 for cell imaging of normal
cells.

Conclusions
This work reports the synthesis of purely aliphatic
intrinsic blue
and green light-emitting 1 via C–C/N–C-coupled
in situ attachment of a fluorophore monomer in solution polymerization
of two nonfluorescent monomers. The N–H-functionalized in situ
protrusion of the fluorophore monomer has been confirmed from NMR
and XPS peaks of the tertiary amide. The smaller H–L in S1 compared to S0, along with smaller σhe and larger Δr, infer the n →
π* emissive charge-transfer in 1. The AIEEs of 1 has=ve been substantiated from HRTEM, DLS, and photophysical
studies. The scalable and reusable pH-responsive biocompatible fluorescent
terpolymer envisages the excellent Fe(III)-sensing at lower LOD, high-performance
removal of Fe(III), excellent cell viability, and high-contrast cell
imaging on normal MDCK cells. The new method for strategic synthesis
of intrinsically fluorescent multifunctional 1 should
be broadened for the syntheses of other purely aliphatic intrinsically
fluorescent biocompatible multipolymers for prospective sensing, removal,
and biomedical applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
CH3OH, CHCl3, and DMSO
of the HPLC grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HCl, NaOH, MA,
NHMA, MBA, PPS, SBS, AgNO3, CaCl2, KCl, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, Cu(NO3)2, FeCl3, FeCl2, HgCl2, CdCl2, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, SbCl3, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and Bi(NO3)3 of analytical grades were purchased from Merck.

Synthesis of
the Fluorescent Terpolymer
The fluorescent
terpolymer was synthesized by solution polymerization involving NHMA
+ MA in water (Scheme 1). Initially, in a three-neck reactor, 30 mL 0.0443 mol NHMA and
10 mL 0.0044 mol MA were mixed at 600 rpm, followed by adding 5 mL
0.2594 mmol MBA. Thereafter, the solution polymerization in water
was initiated via gradual additions of 10 mL 0.0925 + 0.2402 mmol
PPS + SBS redox initiators. The as-prepared terpolymer (Scheme 1) was allowed to swell in 1:3
(v/v) methanol/water solution for removing unreacted monomers, oligomers,
and other components, followed by drying under vacuum for 24 h.

Characterization
The terpolymer was characterized using
techniques summarized in Table S6. Origin
9.0 and ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 were used for graphics-based analyses
and drawing chemical structures, respectively.

Computational Details
The spin-restricted formalism
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of DFT was employed for the optimization
of S0 geometries of 1, using Gaussian 09 package.
The frequency calculations were done to test the optimized structures
relating to the minima on potential energy surfaces. To find the vertical
excited energies, S1 structures were optimized via TDDFT
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Additionally, long-range functional CAM-B3LYP,
ωB97XD, and hybrid functional PBE0 were employed for computing
vertical excitation energies. Fluorescence energies were computed
from the lowest excited-state optimized structures. The first twenty
S1 → S0 transitions were evaluated employing
TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d). Additionally, for exploring exact pictures of excited
states, NTO analyses were performed to represent the compact orbital.

Calculation of the Average Lifetime
The average lifetimes
of 1 and Fe(III)-1 were calculated using the method reported elsewhere.38

Cell Lines and MTT Assay
The MDCK
cell was purchased
from ATCC. The cell was cultured in the Eagle’s minimal essential
medium, supplemented with 1:99 (v/v) penicillin streptomycin/water
solution and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in 95:5 (v/v) air/CO2 within a humidified incubator at 37 °C. In a 96-well
plate, 104 MDCK cells were plated and incubated overnight
for seeding at a standard dose of radiation and compounds. Thereafter,
MDCK cells were treated with 1 of variable concentrations.
After 72 h incubation, MTT assay was done for determining the cell
viability. For each experiment, the assay was performed thrice independently.
The decrease in viability was directly proportional to the cytotoxic
effect of 1. The viability of cell was calculated from the following
equation.39 12
