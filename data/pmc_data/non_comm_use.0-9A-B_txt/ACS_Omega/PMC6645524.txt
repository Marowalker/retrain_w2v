Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and hard carbon
(HC) are commonly used anodes in the Li-ion batteries. LTO has an
operating voltage of 1.55 V and exhibits high-rate performance but
with limited capacity. HC has high specific capacity but extremely
low operating voltage. Herein, we show that a simple physical mixture
of the two enhances the half-cell as well as full-cell performance
through a synergistic cooperation between the materials. Specifically,
the LTO–HC mixed anodes exhibit impressive performance even
at high C-rates. This results from a quick internalization of Li ions
by LTO followed by their distribution to HC regions via the high density
of the winding internal interfaces between the two. The full cells
of the LTO–HC mixed anodes with LiCoO2 (LCO) evince
an enhanced operating voltage window and a well-defined plateau. Because
of a reduced irreversible capacity loss in the LCO/mixed anode full
cells, the overall specific capacity is better than the LCO/pristine
anode full cells. Also, with the LTO–HC 20–80 anode
(Li content reduced by 80%), the full cell exhibits an impressive
performance when compared to pristine anodes without pre-lithiation.
The LCO/mixed anode full cells have excellent cycling stability up
to 500 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g–1.

Introduction
Li-ion batteries are
the suitable choice for most of the practical
applications such as portable electronics and hybrid/electric vehicles
because of their durability, high power and energy density, long cycle
life, and low self-discharge rate.1 There
have been numerous developments made on the electrode materials appropriate
for the Li-ion batteries to achieve state-of-the-art performance from
the device and mitigating the problems faced during implementation
on the real systems.2,3 For any practical or commercial
application, the battery must deliver fairly high power density as
well as energy density with minimal capacity fade during cycling.4 To accomplish these requirements, various anode
materials have been investigated, graphite being the most popular
among all. An ideal anode material should have a low intercalation
potential for Li insertion/de-insertion, short paths for ion diffusions
leading to high rate capability, low volume expansion during lithiation
and de-lithiation, low cost, and environmental-friendly character.5

Among the various anodes investigated so
far for the Li-ion batteries,
Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) is well-known owing
to their superior characteristics. LTO exhibits a well-defined operating
voltage of 1.55 V and a specific capacity of 175 mA h g–1, making it useful for practical applications.6 It has high rate capability, good cycle life and, importantly,
a negligible volume expansion during charging and discharging. LTO
has the spinel structure and it transforms into a rock salt structure
(Li7Ti5O12) during discharging, which
has lattice parameters comparable to the spinel structure.7 The process takes place by the migration of Li
ions from the tetrahedral sites to the octahedral sites and the three
incoming Li ions occupying the vacant tetrahedral sites and moving
to octahedral sites. The overall reaction mechanism is given in the
equation below 1  

The structural transformation is reversible and is called topotactic
as the final structure is similar to the parent one.8 However, in spite of all these features, LTO has not been
considered as the optimum choice as an anode material for practical
devices because of some of its intrinsic limitations. Specifically,
LTO has poor electronic conductivity and owing to its low specific
capacity, it is considered as a low energy density anode material.
To overcome these issues, various interesting strategies have been
developed such as making LTO composites with conducting materials
such as carbon or metal nanoparticles,9 making nanostructured LTO,10,11 or coating LTO with
hard or soft carbon by ball milling, chemical vapor deposition, or
pyrolysis methods.12−16 However, these methods are expensive and elevate the overall cost
of the battery including the complexity in synthesis.

Hard carbon
(HC), on the other hand, is another good choice for
the Li-ion battery anode because of its high reversible capacity and
lower Li intake potential.17 HCs are commonly
derived from biomass by a simple pyrolysis treatment, thus representing
a cheap material for battery application.18 HC, being non-graphitizable, has its planes randomly oriented with
enhanced d-spacing.19 Though
it has a low surface area, it is still considered to be a high energy
density material as it has high specific capacity. As proposed by
Stevens and Dahn,20 HC stores ions by intercalation
as well as adsorption. The intercalation occurs in the graphitic planes
of the carbon in the voltage range of 1–0.1 V represented by
the sloping region in the discharge curve.21 The sloping nature of the curve indicates that the voltage varies
for every Li site available. The adsorption occurs at very low voltages
lying close to metal plating in the micro- or nanopores of the carbon
where a large number of ions get trapped and can be extracted only
at extremely low current densities.22 These
ions are irreversibly trapped, causing a huge first cycle capacity
loss.23 This limits the rate performance
of the material and thereby the power density, making it inappropriate
for potential use. To address this problem, HCs are functionalized
with dopants or nanoparticles to enhance the specific capacity and
operating window.24,25

In this work, we propose
and demonstrate that a simple physical
mixture of LTO and HC as an anode has several advantages in terms
of enhanced performance factors through synergistic effects. Interestingly,
because of the specific scientific reasons outlined in the course
of the discussion, this simple approach combines the advantages of
the individual anodes and diminishes their respective shortcomings,
eliminating the need to use any complex synthesis protocol. We have
investigated such LTO–HC mixed anodes in half-cells at various
C-rates as well as at fairly high fixed values of constant current
densities. Moreover, the full cells have also been tested with LiCoO2 (LCO) to prove that the Li content of anodes can be dramatically
reduced to as low as 20%, still retaining the high-performance factors
without any pre-lithiation process involved. Thus, this work proposes
a facile methodology to gain high power as well as energy density
of a full-cell device without the use of any tedious procedure, thereby
reducing the cost and processing complexity or time.

Results and Discussion
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data for LTO and HC are given
in Figure S1. The XRD pattern for LTO (Figure S1a) can be indexed to the cubic spinel
structure with the space group Fd3̅m according to the literature (JCPDS file no. 49-0207).
The XRD for HC (Figure S1b) consists of
the broad peaks representing (002) and (100) planes of amorphous carbon
at the 2θ values of 23.6° and 43.8°, respectively.12

Electrochemical Data
Impedance Spectroscopy
Figure 1a illustrates
the impedance spectra of all
the four samples before cycling. The higher frequency regions of the
Nyquist plot consist of a semicircle which is the measure of the charge
transfer resistance at the electrode surface.26 The series resistance is found to be less in all the samples. The
charge transfer resistance of the pristine LTO electrode is the lowest
among all cases in this case. The Nyquist plot for HC exhibits a larger
semicircle at high frequency owing to the higher charge transfer resistance
at the electrode surface. At low frequencies, the Warburg component,
that is, the sloping line corresponds to the diffusion process occurring
in the bulk material.27 The LTO–HC
20–80 mixed anode impedance resembles that of pristine HC,
whereas that of the LTO–HC 50–50 mixed anode exhibits
a second semicircle. The semicircle at high frequencies corresponds
to the diffusion through pores of the electrode. The mid-frequency
semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance and the constant
phase element (CPE) at the electrode–electrolyte interphase.28 The occurrence of these two could also be attributed
to the non-homogenous electrode composed of small and big particle
sizes as discussed at length by Xu et al.29 In the plot, the LTO anode shows slow diffusion. As for the present
case of mixed material anodes, such type of the Nyquist plot has indeed
been observed in electrodes containing components having different
particle sizes, big and small, and they have been studied and discussed
extensively earlier.30 The slow diffusion
in such cases has been attributed to the non-homogeneity of the electrode
surface, the thickness, and the difference in particle sizes of the
materials.31 When two differently sized
particles are present and the calendaring of the electrode is not
uniform, then the surface inhomogeneity leads to the development of
an arc in the middle-to-low-frequency region and results in the inclination
of impedance curve toward the real impedance axis. As LTO and HC have
different particle sizes, the electrode surface will be inhomogeneous,
causing unequal distribution of mass that leads to a shift in the
semicircle near the low frequency regions. After 5 cycles, all electrodes
exhibit a semicircle with a reduced charge transfer resistance in
the high-frequency region and the low frequency region corresponding
to bulk ion diffusion, as shown in Figure 1b. The 50–50 case and the pristine
LTO are similar, whereas the 20–80 case is close to the pristine
HC in nature.

and
cyclic voltammograms (c) before cycling and (d) after 5 cycles of
anodes.

Cyclic Voltammetry
The CV curves of the samples are
presented in Figure 1c,d. The pristine LTO cathodic scan has an intercalation peak at
1.5 V and a small peak at 0.7 V. During the anodic scan, the de-intercalation
peak occurs at 1.6 V.32 The redox peaks
are consistent in the subsequent cycles. The first cycle CV for HC
consists of three broad peaks along with the intercalation peak below
0.1 V in the reverse scan.33 The peak at
0.65 V is due to the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation and
disappears in the next cycle. The redox peaks at 0.93 and 1.03 V are
also present in the first cycle and can be seen in subsequent cycles
with a small shift. The peak at 0.19 V could be attributed to side
reaction or irreversible ion adsorption and is absent in later cycles.
The CV of the mixed anodes reveals the characteristic peaks of both
LTO and HC as evident from the CV curve of LTO–HC 50–50
and LTO–HC 20–80.

Galvanostatic Charge–Discharge
The half-cells
were first discharged at a low current density of 50 mA g–1 to facilitate uniform SEI layer growth on the electrode surface.
The nature of the charge–discharge curves shown in Figure 2 explains the dual
character of the mixed anodes when compared to the pristine ones.
The LTO anode has a plateau at a high voltage of 1.55 V, whereas HC
has a sloping nature at a high voltage but a plateau near to 0.01
V. The LTO–HC 50–50 discharge curve has a flat plateau
at a high voltage corresponding to the Li insertion potential of LTO
as well as the sloping region from 1 to 0.1 V corresponding to the
HC intercalation potential in the equal proportion. The LTO–HC
20–80 mixed anode partially exhibits the LTO character, with
the HC character dominating the charge–discharge profile. The
mixed anodes give high capacity as compared to the pristine anodes
because of the enhanced electrochemical window from 1.55 to 0.01 V,
whereas this advantage is not there in the case of individual anode
materials (in LTO, it is 1.55 V and in HC, it is 0.1–0.01 V
approx.). The theoretical capacities of LTO and HC are 175 and 372
mA h g–1, respectively. The calculated capacities
for the mixed anodes considering the weight ratio are 273 mA h g–1 for LTO–HC 50–50 and 332.6 mA h g–1 for LTO–HC 20–80. As seen from the
curves, the realized capacity of HC is much lower than the predicted
value which implies that the ion adsorption sites in HC are not accessible
to Li ions to the full extent and need very low current densities
to be filled (adsorption in nanopores of HC). The reason for the excess
capacity in the mixed anode cases is the quick internalization of
ions facilitated by LTO and then the distribution of ions in the HC
channels or the nanopores. The process of quick Li-ion internalization
afforded by LTO thus helps these ions access more sites of HC at the
same current density, hence the higher capacity reflected at that
current density. This way, the capacity close to the predicted value
is achieved in the mixed anodes as proven by our charge–discharge
measurements, which is not the case with pristine HC because of its
poor rate capability at the same current density. The rate performance
of the samples was checked at different C-rates given in the Supporting Information. Figure S2 elucidates the rate performance of all the samples along
with the Coulombic efficiency. The cells were cycled at high rates
of 20 C. As is evident, pristine LTO, being the high rate capability
anode, does not undergo much degradation in the specific capacity
even at 20 C and gives a specific capacity value of about 145 mA h
g–1, whereas for the HC case, the specific capacity
drops down drastically when subjected to high C-rates and the specific
capacity falls down to 90 mA h g–1. Interestingly,
the LTO–HC mixed anodes perform superior to individual anodes
at high rates, and the specific capacity lies close to that of pristine
LTO. Thus, the LTO–HC 50–50 mixture anode exhibits a
specific capacity of 130 mA h g–1 at 20 C, whereas
the LTO–HC 20–80 mixture anode gives a capacity of about
145 mA h g–1. The electrodes were also cycled at
constant current densities evinced in Figure 3. At high current densities of 2 and 6 A
g–1, the mixed anodes possess an extremely impressive
performance and high cycling stability up to 3000 cycles with minimal
capacity fade. In these cases as well, HC fails to withstand high
current densities, whereas the mixed LTO–HC electrodes function
almost similar to LTO in spite of a very significant reduction in
the Li content in the anode. The possible reasons for this interesting
outcome have been discussed below in the Mechanism
of Charge Storage section.

curve of all four cases at 50 mA g–1 and (b) first
charge curve at 50 mA g–1.

at 6 A g–1.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images in Figure 4 reveal the morphologies of the electrodes of pristine
and mixed LTO–HC materials at different stages of cycling.
After the first discharge, the electrodes have a uniform covering
of the surface by the SEI layer. After 10 cycles, the SEI layer of
LTO and HC is rather thin, whereas the mixed LTO–HC electrodes
have a robust SEI layer on the surface. After 200 cycles, the SEI
layer on the LTO and HC surfaces ruptures at some areas of electrodes,
but that on the mixed LTO–HC electrodes (50–50 and 20–80
cases) reflects uniformity throughout the surface, providing good
cycling stability to the mixed LTO–HC anodes. It could be anticipated
that the SEI formation in mixed cases consists of two different interfaces,
and the layer characteristics are governed by both the anodes. This
is an interesting case of laterally inhomogeneous fabric of the SEI
layer, and importantly, the synergistic effect of individual material
surfaces exposed to electrolyte leads to a better SEI formation that
does not deteriorate as noted in the case of individual anodes. The
synergistic effect of two SEI components clearly helps with stress
relaxation and mechanical stability. This correlates well with the
good performance of the mixed electrodes during charging even at high
current densities. The uniform coverage of the electrode surface further
suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and the irreversible Li loss.
Hence, the capacity is retained even after cycling up to 3000 cycles
(as shown in Figure 3).

after first discharge; third row: after 10 cycles; and fourth row:
after 200 cycles.

Mechanism of Charge Storage
Scheme 1 illustrates
the proposed mechanism of the
Li-ion storage in the case of the mixed anodes as compared to the
pristine material anodes. As is well-known, LTO has well-defined Li
insertion sites and because of small diffusion paths for ion migration
from 8a tetrahedral sites to 16c octahedral sites of the spinel structure,
the rate capability is high, but the capacity is low because of the
limited Li-ion vacancies as explained in the introduction above. Because
of high-rate capability, the LTO capacity does not drop when the current
density is raised from a low to a high value. On the other hand, HC
has turbostratic planes and no direct channels or sites for ions as
in the LTO case. Moreover, HC consists of nanopores and thus, to realize
its full capacity, it has to be charged at very low current densities
for all pores to get filled. Thus, the HC anode gives high capacity
at low current densities, but very low capacity at high current densities
as the Li ions are not able to access all the available sites. As
seen in the mixed anode cases, the capacity is enhanced and the rate
performance is also improved because of the channelized distribution
of the ions. The presence of LTO facilitates quick Li uptake even
at high rates, and HC provides additional sites for their localization
on the surface of the electrode. The synergistic effect of quick internalization
of Li ions by LTO and its re-distribution to the HC across the internal
effective large area winding interfaces between LTO and HC provides
high power as well as energy density in the mixed materials anode
case. This is true for the case where Li content is reduced even up
to 80%.

Scheme 1 Mechanism of Charge Storage in the Mixed Anodes
Full Cells with LiCoO2
For full-cell fabrication,
the LCO cathode was used. The half-cell performance of LCO is given
in the Supporting Information in Figure
S3. LCO gives a specific capacity of 165 mA h g–1 at 50 mA g–1.

The full cells were tested
at C/4 rates, and the curves are presented in Figure S4. The LCO/LTO full cell gives a specific capacity
of 85 mA h g–1 with a negligible irreversible capacity
loss. The full-cell operating voltage is from 1.8 to 2.5 V and has
a plateau at 2.35 V. It was found that if the full cell is charged
beyond 2.5 V, there is a rapid decay in the specific capacity, and
the cell is not stable in that voltage window. The LCO/HC full cell
gives the first charging capacity of 130 mA h g–1 but has a substantial capacity loss of about 60 mA h g–1, giving an overall cell capacity close to 70 mA h g–1.

The LCO/LTO–HC 50–50 full cell also undergoes
an
irreversible capacity loss of 20 mA h g–1 but still
gives an impressive specific capacity of 100 mA h g–1, which is higher than that of the LTO and HC-only full cells with
LCO. The LCO/LTO–HC 20–80 full cell (with dramatic reduction
of Li content in the anode) also performs better than the individual
anode half-cells but has an irreversible capacity loss of 40 mA h
g–1, giving a full-cell reversible capacity close
to 95 mA h g–1. The important achievement in these
two cases is the enhancement of the operating voltage window of the
full cells and the specific capacity leading to enhanced power and
energy density of the full-cell device without any pretreatment of
the anode such as pre-lithiation. Also, the nature of the full-cell
charge–discharge depends on the anode characteristic. The LCO/LTO
full cell has a plateau at 2.35 V, whereas the LCO/HC full cell has
a sloping curve with no constant operating potential, a limitation
in the device application. When the mixed LTO–HC 50–50
and 20–80 materials are used against LCO, a plateau region
at 2.35 V is seen with an enhanced potential window up to 3.5 V, giving
higher specific capacity.

The full cells were also tested at
a high current density of 100
mA g–1 for cycling stability, and the charge–discharge
curves are specified in Figure 5. The LCO/LTO full cell has a specific capacity of 50 mA h
g–1 and is stable up to 250 cycles but subsequently
starts degrading. The LCO/HC full cell gives a reversible capacity
of only 30 mA h g–1 and suffers from constant capacity
fade. The LTO–HC 50–50 and LCO-based full cell has the
highest specific capacity of 55 mA h g–1 and is
highly stable up to 500 cycles without any capacity fading. The LCO/LTO–HC
20–80 full cell has a slightly lower value as compared to LCO/LTO
and LCO/LTO–HC 50–50 full cells (40 mA h g–1) but is still much higher than the LCO/HC full cell with excellent
stability up to 500 cycles. The corresponding energy densities of
the full cells are 34 W h/kg for LCO/LTO, 24 W h/kg for LCO/HC, 55
W h/kg for LCO/LTO–HC 50–50, and 40 W h/kg for LCO/LTO–HC
20–80. We gain in terms of high energy density owing to an
enhanced operating potential window. The LCO/HC full cell suffers
from a substantial irreversible capacity loss and thus lacks stability
as well as reversible capacity retention. Also, when subjected to
a high current density of 100 mA g–1, the LCO/pristine
anode full cells do not perform well, whereas the LCO/LTO–HC
mixed anodes are superior with the power density enhancement of the
full cells.

Conclusions
Li-battery
anodes are prepared by a simple physical mixing of two
anode materials, namely LTO and HC, with different strengths and weaknesses
in terms of capacity and rate capability properties, in different
proportions. Interestingly, the performance of such mixed anodes is
found to be superior to that of the individual material (LTO or HC)
anodes, which can be attributed to a synergistic effect of rapid internalization
and internal re-distribution of Li ions. This condition also represents
a rather unique case of a laterally inhomogeneous SEI which is highly
stable, possibly because of its ability for stress accommodation.
In the full cells with LCO cathodes, the LTO–HC mixed anodes
flaunt much higher stability than only LTO- or HC anode-based full
cells. Importantly, the Li content in the anode can be reduced by
as much as 80%, and no pretreatment is performed on the anodes to
achieve a desirable level of performance. At a high current density
of 100 mA g–1, the LTO–HC mixed anodes full-cell
performance is excellent, and the operating voltage window is also
enhanced for full-cell operation.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
LTO and LCO procured from Sigma-Aldrich
and commercially available HC were used as received. The mixed anodes
were prepared by taking LTO and HC in two proportions: 50–50
and 20–80 by weight. The slurry was made by mixing the anode
powders with Super P and polyvinylidene fluoride binder in the ratio
of 80:10:10 and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the solvent.
The slurry was coated on the Cu foil and was kept for drying overnight
at 80 °C. The slurry was coated on the Cu foil and was kept for
drying overnight at 80 °C. The foil was then punched into 1 cm2 circular discs. PXRD was done using a Bruker D8-ADVANCE X-ray
diffractometer (Germany) with Cu Kα (wavelength = 1.5418 Å).
SEM was done using an FEI Nova Nano 450 SEM instrument.

Electrochemical
Measurements
The 2032 coin cells were
made using mixed anodes, Li metal, and Whatman separator known as
half-cell configuration. The full cells were fabricated using LTO
and HC mixed anodes and the LCO cathode. The electrolyte used was
commercial LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate
(in the volume ratio of 1:1). Galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements were done with BTS-Neware (China) 5 V, 10 mA battery
tester. The impedance and cyclic voltammetry were done with a VMP3
biologic system equipped with potentiostat and galvanostat channels.
The mass loading of the electrodes is in the range of 1.3–1.5
mg. The cathode to anode mass ratio is 1:1 for LTO and 1.5:1 for LTO–HC
50–50, LTO–HC 20–80, and HC. The electrolyte
was the same for full cells. The full-cell fabrication was done using
2032 coin cells with a Whatman separator. The full-cell measurements
were done considering the weight of both the cathode and the anode
in all the cases.
