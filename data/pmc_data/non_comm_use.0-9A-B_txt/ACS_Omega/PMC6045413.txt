Biomacromolecule
loading is the popular research in the biomedical
field. To control the loading amount and releasing profile, various
materials and fabrication techniques were developed. In this study,
layer-by-layer assembly of multilayer films between collagen (Col)
and graphene oxide (GO) was used to control the release of the loading
molecule. By mixing GO into the system, ovalbumin (OVA) can be spontaneously
adsorbed onto the GO sheet (denoted as GO/OVA) via the hydrophobic
interaction. Two kinds of multilayer films (Col/GO/OVA and Col/GO/OVA)
were fabricated. The thickness growth curve, quantitative of each
layer adsorption, film morphology, stability, cell viability, and
OVA release from multilayer films were investigated. The result has
shown excellent film stability, macromolecule loading, and sustained
release because of GO ability.

1 Introduction
Drug
delivery system is one of the most popular topics in biomedical
engineering fields. To deliver therapeutic molecules, various techniques
and materials were used. Even though there are some methods which
use simple materials and facial methods such as Chitosan hydrogel
microneedles and composite ceramic–polymer hydrogels, they
require many complex steps and also show a rapid release of the loading
molecule.1,2 High loading ability and rapid release property
can be achieved via a lysozyme-assisted oil/water emulsion technique.
In this technique, a hollow silica nanosphere with large through holes
plays a key role.3 Although complex copolymer
and liposome multidomain peptide nanofibers show a good result, both
of them need to be fabricated via a complicated method.4,5 The easy and simple technique normally shows an uninteresting result,
but for the highly effective carrier, the complicated process was
needed. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a simple and versatile method
for coating the substrate. By using the sequentially adsorbed opposite
charge materials, the LbL film can present a nanoscale-controllable
film. This technique allows various kinds of material coating onto
the different substrates via a large variety of interactions.6−8 In a drug delivery system, many studies used an LbL assembly to
fabricate multilayer structures with drug loading. Many materials
were used as building blocks such as polyelectrolytes,9,10 block copolymer micelles,11,12 and silica nanoparticles.13 There are several therapeutic molecules that
can be loaded in these films such as DNA, protein,14 anti-HIV microbicide (tenofovir),15 antibacterial,16 antibiotic,17 and anticancer drug.18

Graphene oxide (GO) belongs to the carbon family. It can be
obtained
by exfoliation of natural graphite powder by Hummers’ method.19 GO with one-atom thickness contained a carboxylic
group at the edge and phenol, hydroxyl, and epoxide at the basal plane.
With these functional groups together with the high surface area,
GO is one of the popular materials used in many fields such as energy
storage,20 gas barrier,21,22 optical,23 and biological applications.
In biomedical applications, GO was used for different functions such
as antibacterial24 and drug delivery25−27 and as material stabilizers.28 Together
with another material, GO layer acts as the capping or blocking part
to prevent the burst releasing a loading molecule.10,29,30 Collagen (Col) is one of the popular materials
in drug delivery fields because of its biocompatibility.31,32 In this study, we present a simple technique for fabricating a macromolecule
loading and a long-term release material (as shown in Figure 1). Ovalbumin (OVA) was used
as a model drug in this study. By using the full advantage of GO,
OVA 45 kDa globular protein (pI ≈ 4.6) was adsorbed onto the
GO sheet spontaneously. Because of the rich nonpolar amino acid group
in OVA, the hydrophobic interaction occurs. Furthermore, GO acts as
the capping layer and prevents the rapid release in our film, resulting
in long-term release in this system.

2 Materials and Method
2.1 Materials
The Col type I solution
extracted from the rat tail with ≥90% purity was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Dallas, TX, USA). Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; 10×) was purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY,
USA). OVA extracted from egg white was purchased from Bio Basic Canada
Inc (Toronto, CANADA). OVA and Texas Red conjugate were purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientific Ltd. Fluorescein isothiocyanate, isomer
I, and sodium acetate buffer solution (pH 5.2) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid were purchased
from Daejung, Korea. Random size GO in this study was prepared from
graphite powder (20 μm, Alfa Aesar, MA) via the modified Hummers’
method.

2.2 Film Preparation on the Substrate
In this study, multilayer films were fabricated on a Si wafer or
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film using an LbL assembly dipping
technique. The substrate was treated by O2 plasma (Femto
Science, Korea) for 2 min to produce the negatively charged surface.
The treated substrate was dipped into Col solution (1 mg/mL in acetate
buffer solution, pH 5.2) for 10 min, followed by rinsing twice with
distilled (DI) water (pH 5.2) for 2 min. Subsequently, the substrate
was dipped into GO solution (0.5 mg/mL, pH 6) and washed twice with
DI water (pH 6). A multilayer film was obtained by repeating the step
described above.

2.3 Col/GO Film Characterization
The
thickness growth curve of the Col/GO multilayer film was detected
by a profilometer (Dektak 150; Veeco Plainview, USA). The quantity
of each Col and GO layer adsorption was measured by using a quartz
crystal microbalance (QCM 200; Stanford Research Systems, Inc., USA).
The amount of polymer adsorption was calculated from the decreasing
frequency (ΔF) by Sauerbrey’s equation33 1  where F0 is the
fundamental resonance frequency of the crystal, A is the area of the Au-chrome electrode, and μq (2.95
× 1011 g/(cm·s2)) and ρq (2.65
g·cm–3) are the shear modulus and density of
quartz, respectively. Applying these numerical values, the equation
can be simplified as follows: 2  where
Δma is the mass change per unit
area of the quartz crystal (μg/cm2).

The surface
morphology of the multilayer film was
investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (NX-10; Park Systems,
Korea) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (LIBRA 120,
Carl Zeiss). The zeta potential of the solution was measured by a
nanoparticle analyzer model SZ-100 (HORIBA, Japan). The film stability
was detected by soaking the film in 1× PBS at 37 °C, and
then a profilometer was used to measure the thickness at each time
point.

2.4 Cell Culture and in Vitro Cytotoxicity of
the Col/GO Film
A human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cell was
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin under
37 °C and 5% CO2 condition. After that, 80% confluence
of cells (1 × 104) were seeded in 12-well plates and
cultured overnight. Then, the (Col/GO)5.5 multilayer film
fabricated on the PET film was rolled and put onto the wall of each
well. After a certain period (1 and 3 days), the film was removed
and cell viability was tested by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, 10 μL of the MTT solution
was added to each well and incubated for 2 h in the incubator without
light. Then, the relative amounts of viable cells were measured by
a microplate reader at 540 nm wavelength.

2.5 OVA Loading
on the GO Sheet
To load
OVA on the GO sheet, OVA (10 μg/mL) in sodium acetate buffer
solution (pH 5) was mixed with GO solution (0.5 mg/mL pH 6) by a 1:1
volume ratio. Then, the mixing solution was stirred overnight to ensure
that OVA can be adsorbed onto the GO nanosheet. After centrifuging
at 3000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and then DI water
(pH 6) was added. The final solution (GO/OVA) was redispersed by using
an ultrasonic bath and vortexed.

2.6 OVA Loading
on the Col/GO Film
For
loading OVA on the Col/GO film, two kinds of multilayer structures
(bilayer and trilayer structures) were fabricated on the substrate
to observe the effect of different interactions for OVA release. For
the bilayer structure (Col/GO/OVA) film assembly, the Si wafer was
cleaned and dipped into the Col solution, followed by the washing
step. Then, the substrate was dipped into the GO/OVA solution, followed
by the same washing step. The multilayer film was obtained by repeating
the cycle as described above. The trilayer structure (Col/GO/OVA)
film was prepared using the same method. Briefly, the cleaned Si wafer
was dipped into the Col, GO, and OVA solution. After each dipping
step, DI water was used for washing the unreacted substance, and a
multilayer film was obtained by repeating the previous steps.

2.7 OVA Release Test
For measuring OVA
release from the multilayer film, OVA-conjugated Texas red (Invitrogen,
USA) was used for film fabrication, instead of normal OVA. The bilayer
structure (Col/GO/OVA)21 and the trilayer structure (Col/GO/OVA)15 were fabricated on a Si wafer, and the thickness of both
films was 150 nm. Then, the multilayer film was cut into 1 ×
1 cm2 pieces and soaked in 1× PBS solution under 37
°C. The release of OVA–Texas Red was obtained by an FP-8300
spectrofluorometer (JASCO) at the fluorescent emission wavelength
of 615 nm.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of the Col/GO Multilayer
Film
The LbL assembly method is used for the fabrication
of multilayer films from Col and GO by a dipping technique. The main
driving force to assemble this film is electrostatic interaction.
During the film fabrication, Col has a slightly positive charge because
of its pI ≈ 8.2–8.434 and
GO has a negative charge at pH 6. From the result of each bilayer’s
thickness, this multilayer film exhibited a linear growth curve as
shown in Figure 2a.
The quantitative adsorption of Col and GO in the Col/GO film (Figure 2b) shows a decrease
in QCM frequency because of the increasing mass adsorption on the
gold electrode. The mass adsorption ratio between Col and GO is 1.7:1.
It can be confirmed that the LbL assembly between Col and GO is successful,
from the curve of thickness growth and QCM data. To investigate film
morphology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM were used.
The results from the SEM images (Figure 2d,e) illustrated Col/GO film morphology with
a wrinkle surface because of the adsorption of GO sheet onto the surface.
From the AFM image (Figure 2f), Col fiber was detected. This fiber was distributed in
the whole area and covered by the GO sheet. The root mean square of
the (Col/GO)10 film was 22.5 nm, which indicates that the
film surface is smooth. The film stability was concluded by the decrease
of thickness. From Figure 5a, the thickness was decreased by time, and the stability
was proportional to the number of bilayers because of the presence
of GO. The 15-bilayer film thickness still remained more than 80%,
when we measured after 1 week.

films. (b) QCM

of day 3).

3.2 Cytotoxicity
of the Col/GO Film on HDF Cells
In order to observe the cell
viability, the HDF cell was cultured
and seeded in 12-well plates at a seeding density of 1 × 104 cells in each well. Cells were incubated overnight, and then
the Col/GO film was placed on the wall of a culture well plate subsequently.
At a certain time point (1 and 3 days), the cell viability was measured
using the MTT assay. Hu et al. (2011) reported that the physical contact
between the cell and the GO sheet can cause damage to the cell membrane.35 Liao et al. (2011) showed that the toxicity
of GO depends on its exposure to the environment whether GO aggregates
or not. Furthermore, the interaction with the cell can also be one
of the factors to affect the toxicity of GO.36 Two groups of Col/GO films were prepared to investigate the effect
of physical contact with GO sheet on the damaged cell membrane. In
the first group, GO was exposed to outside. This group was denoted
by (Col/GO)n where n =
1, 3, and 5 bilayers. In another group, GO was covered by the Col
layer to prevent direct contact between GO and the cell membrane,
which was denoted as (Col/GO)n.5. Figure 2 shows the MTT assay
of HDF cells treated by multilayer films with Col coverage. There
was no significant difference between them (p >
0.05)
on day 1 and had a tendency to induce HDF cell proliferation when
compared to the control group on day 3, whereas the group with GO
exposure shows a decrease in cell viability. From Figure S1 (Supporting Information), HDF cells treated by
the GO-exposed film show a significant decrease in cell viability.
However, the percentage of cell viability is still higher than 80.

3.3 OVA-Loading Capacity on Multilayer Films
We then observed whether ova protein can be spontaneously bound
with GO or released sustainably. Different films were prepared by
using the LbL assembly method, and the zeta potential of each material
is shown in Table 1. It can be confirmed that the fabrication of (Col/GO/OVA) and (Col/GO/OVA)
was successful in OVA loading, which can be proved by the growth curve
of film thickness and QCM. The thickness growth curve of the Col/GO/OVA
film (Figure 3a) shows
a linear relationship with the high standard deviation (SD), which
refers to the high roughness of the film surface. This result was
confirmed by the SEM image as shown in Figure 4a. The film surface showed high roughness
because of the GO/OVA coalescence and the size within 200 nm to micron
size as shown in Figure 4a (inset). The binding of OVA on the GO sheet was due to the hydrophobic
interaction of large size GO and 163 nonpolar amino acid group in
an OVA structure.37,38 The QCM data of Col/GO/OVA show
the quantity of layer adsorption, and the adsorption ratio between
Col and GO/OVA was 1:5. This ratio indicates that the amount of GO/OVA
adsorption was higher than that of Col.

Figure 3 (a) Thickness growth
curve of Col/GO/OVA and Col/GO/OVA multilayer
films. (b) QCM data represent the frequency change of Col/GO/OVA and
Col/GO/OVA structures. (SD, n = 3).

films. Inset

Table 1 Zeta Potential
of Each Material Used
in LbL Film Fabrication
material	zeta potential
(mV)	
Col pH 5.2	9.93 ± 0.9	
GO pH 6	–55.3 ± 2.84	
GO/OVA pH 6	–36.8 ± 1.47	
OVA pH 5.2	slightly positive	
The Col/GO/OVA film shows
a linear relationship with lower SD than
the Col/GO/OVA film. The SEM image (Figure 4b) shows a more uniform surface film than
the surface of the Col/GO/OVA film. The less roughness surface in
Col/GO/OVA occurred because the deposition axis of OVA on the GO sheet
was limited. In case of the mixing between GO and OVA in free-standing
form, the adsorption of OVA on the GO sheet occurs in all direction.
This occurrence causes the complexation between both materials
(GO/OVA) and non-uniform deposition, resulting in a rougher surface.
The QCM data (Figure 3b) show that the adsorption ratio between Col/GO/OVA was 6:4:1 in
a trilayer structure. Comparing the adsorption ratios of Col in the
Col/GO film and the Col/GO/OVA film, we found that the adsorption
ratio of Col was similar, but the ratio in the trilayer structure
was lower. For fabricating the LbL assembly film, the adsorption onto
the substrate was promoted by diffusion-driven kinetics.8 Because of the deposition of OVA on the GO sheet,
the zeta potential of GO in a complexation form was changed from −55
to −36 mV. The reduced zeta potential of GO causes the decrease
in the growth rate of the Col layer, as shown in the QCM data. These
phenomena can be explained by the previous study of Zou et al., 2014:
polyelectrolyte was able to penetrate through the GO interspace and
diffuse out by osmotic pressure, resulting in additional deposition.39 In the Col/GO/OVA system, the presence of OVA
onto the GO sheet can obstruct the Col diffusion to GO interlayers
and reduce the driven diffusion of Col.

3.4 Release
of OVA from Multilayer Structures
To investigate the OVA
release from bilayer and trilayer films,
OVA–Texas Red was used for fabricating the LbL film, instead
of OVA. Figure 5b shows the release profile from (Col/GO/OVA)21 and (Col/GO/OVA)15 films. On the basis of the
different interactions in a film fabrication process, we hypothesize
that interdiffusion can be controlled by GO and shows the different
release profile from both the films. However, the bilayer and trilayer
structure films show the similar release profile. The total amounts
of OVA release were 2.19 and 2.07 μg/cm2 for bilayer
and trilayer films, respectively. It was released bristly at the early
stage, followed by a sustained release from the middle period to the
end. The time for the release test is over 70 days. These release
profiles can be explained by the effective barrier ability of the
GO sheet. Many researchers use GO/GO layer as a capping layer to prevent
the rapid release of the loading molecule, and the results have shown
the success in their work.27,30 The upper layer generated
a burst release because of the effect of Col diffusion into the GO
layer and create a new interface, leading to a large void present
between the layer.39 The sustained release
in the mid-end of the release occurred because the multilayers of
GO retard the release of OVA.

4 Conclusions
From this study, GO acts
as a biomacromolecule carrier. GO can
bind with a macromolecule such as OVA spontaneously37 and act as a barrier to prevent the rapid release of the
loading molecule. The LbL assembly method was used for fabricating
multilayer films between Col and GO. Two different kinds of films
were prepared to observe the ability of controlling interdiffusion
by GO. Because of the rich nonpolar amino acid group of OVA resulting
in the spontaneous binding with the GO sheet, the hydrophobic interaction
occurred as the main driving force. The complexation of GO and OVA
was successfully prepared without any catalyst or external stimuli.
The bilayer and trilayer films with OVA loading show the same release
profile, which is different from our hypothesis. Even though GO cannot
control the interdiffusion, its capping ability was excellent. Both
films can release OVA for more than 70 days with a loading amount
of 2.19 and 2.07 μg/cm2 for Col/GO/OVA and Col/GO/OVA
films, respectively. For future study, the Col/GO film with OVA loading
will be used for treating cells, and various biological tests will
be done. Furthermore, to prove more biomacromolecule binding of GO,
another kind of macromolecule will be used.
