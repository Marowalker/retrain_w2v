The structure and morphology of β-crystals
of isotactic polypropylene
(iPP) are of great significance because β-crystals can improve
the toughness and ductility of iPP. Toughening of β-spherulites,
which was ascribed to phase transformation, has been extensively investigated.
However, the toughening mechanism of other β-crystals with special
structures and morphologies is not clear. In this study, β-transcrystallinity
(β-TC), which showed a greater toughening effect than that of
β-spherulite, was constructed through microlayered coextrusion.
During uniaxial stretching, β-TC preferred to transform into
an α-crystal, whereas β-spherulite preferred to transform
to a smectic mesophase. The transformation degree of β-TC was
much higher than that of β-spherulite. More importantly, the
lamellar fragments from β-TC gradually rearranged along the
stretching direction, accompanied by continuous absorption of energy.
The special β–α phase transformation, high transformation
rate, and rearrangement of lamellar fragments led to the highly improved
toughness of the layered samples.

1 Introduction
The
properties and applications of isotactic polypropylene (iPP),1 which is a representative polymorphic polymer
with several crystalline modifications, including a monoclinic α-form,
trigonal β-form, orthorhombic γ-form, trigonal δ-form,
newly found ε-form, and smectic mesophase,2−6 depend largely on its crystallization behavior.7−9 Unlike the α-crystal, which can be obtained under normal conditions,
the β-form can be fabricated only under specific conditions,
such as a temperature gradient,10 melting
shear,2,11 melting and recrystallization of highly
oriented α-iPP fibers,12−16 and addition of a β-nucleating agent (β-NA).17−19 iPP crystallized predominantly in the β-crystal form shows
improved mechanical properties20−22 because the β-spherulites,
with a bundled radial lamellar arrangement, exhibit an inherently
higher ductility than that of α-spherulites, with a cross-hatched
lamellar structure.23−25

Under external force, the breakage and defolding
of the bundled
β lamellae triggered the phase transformation of the β-crystal,21 which has been investigated extensively.26−37 The mechanism of phase transformation is described as a partial
melting–recrystallization26−28 or solid–solid
martensitic transformation.29 The former
theory was endorsed by most researchers, who stressed that a melting–recrystallization
process was required to transform a β-specimen into an α-specimen
because of the basic differences between these structures.30−37 The mechanical stress-induced phase transformation from a less (β-phase)
to a more dense (α-phase) crystalline structure, which represents
an energy sink process and contributed to crack-tip blunting, is known
as the primary cause of increased toughness.

The phase transformation
of a β-crystal was significantly
affected by external factors, especially temperature. It was stated
that the β-to-smectic transformation mainly occurred during
low-temperature deformation, but high-temperature deformation favored
β–α transformation.37−39 Cai et al.38 investigated the uniaxial drawing-induced deformation
and structural transitions of the β-form of iPP at varying temperatures,
and their experimental results indicated that the initial strain for
the strain-induced β–α transformation decreases
with an increase in tensile temperature. In addition, the degree of
β–α transformation was dependent on the frequency
of stress, an increase in which could improve the fraction of β–α
transformation.34 To our knowledge, the
transformation behavior of the β-crystal was mostly investigated
under different external factors. The effect of the β-crystalline
structure, especially the lamellar morphology and orientation, on
the transformation behavior was often neglected.

Because the
special oriented morphology
of β-lamellae was hardly obtained, the phase transformation
was studied within spherulite samples. Some research has demonstrated
that the horizontal and vertical lamellae in β-spherulites underwent
different phase transformation and deformation processes because of
the diversity in stress states during uniaxial stretching. Shi et
al.40 claimed that β-smectic transformation
propagates inside the spherulites from the equatorial regions, in
which the chain axes were nearly parallel to the drawing direction,
toward the diagonal and polar regions. This suggestion of nonsynchronous
transformation in β-spherulites was also reported by Li and
co-workers,28,41,42 who claimed that many melt spots and deformation bands across vertical
lamellae (parallel to the stretching direction) emerged at the yield
point, whereas the neighboring horizontal lamellae rotated toward
the loading direction, indicating that phase transformation of vertical
lamellae was prior to that of horizontal lamellae. They also systematically
investigated the deformation mechanism of a β-crystal and proposed
a deformation mode including the separation of lamellae, interlamellar
shear, and intralamellar slip. According to Henning et al.,22 the type of deformation process depended on
the orientation of the crystalline lamellae with respect to the stretching
direction. Deformation of the lamellar orientation perpendicular to
the loading direction might include lamellar separation and chevron
formation, whereas deformation of the lamellar orientation parallel
to the loading direction included lamellar slip and breaking. These
studies strongly implied that the phase transformation and deformation
processes are related to the orientation of the crystalline lamellae
with respect to the stretching direction. Therefore, stress-induced
phase transformation of a β-crystal with highly ordered crystalline
lamellae, β-transcrystallinity (β-TC)43−45 for instance,
was distinct from that of β-spherulites and needed to be further
studied.

In our previous work,46 the
highly ordered
and content-controlled β-TC was induced by layered interfaces
of alternating layered iPP and β-NA-filled iPP (β-iPP)
samples, which were prepared using microlayered coextrusion technology.
The experimental results on mechanical properties showed that the
elongation at break of layered samples with a high content of β-TC
was more than 7 times higher than that of unstratified samples with
β-spherulites, and the impact strength increased nearly 2 times.
Obviously, the excellent toughness of the layered samples is necessarily
relevant to the special structure and morphology of β-TC. In
this study, unstratified samples with well-developed β-spherulites
and layered samples with content-controlled β-TC layers were
prepared to investigate the phase transformation and toughening mechanism
of β-TC during uniaxial stretching. The connection between phase
transformation and lamellar orientation with respect to the loading
direction was investigated to provide a basis for the preparation
of high-performance materials.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Content of β-TC
In our previous
work, the iPP layer was found to be almost occupied by β-TC
if the thickness of the iPP layer was lower than 50 μm, and
the content of β-TC could be increased further by increasing
the r value (the thickness ratios of the iPP and
β-iPP layers).46 By adjusting the
rotation speed of the extruders, two 64-layer samples, with thickness
ratios of 1:1 (L(1/1)) and 3:1 (L(3/1)), respectively, were prepared.
Unstratified samples (Un), with the same β-NA content as that
in the β-iPP layer, were also prepared for comparison with the
layered samples. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) micrographs of
Un, L(1/1), and L(3/1) are shown in Figure 1a–c, respectively. In the Un sample,
the presence of β-NA led to large amounts of small and uniformly
dispersed β-spherulites. In the layered samples, the iPP and
β-iPP layers aligned alternately along the Z direction and were parallel to the extrusion direction (Y direction). Large amounts of small β-spherulites
can be observed in the β-iPP layers. Nevertheless, iPP layers
were found to be almost occupied by β-TC, which grew from the
interfaces and continuously arranged along the Y direction.
Larger amounts of β-TC can be observed in the L(3/1) sample
compared with the L(1/1) sample. For the purpose of accurately calculating
the content of β-crystal, the thickness ratios of the iPP and
β-iPP layers (r) were statistically calculated
from the POM photographs and have been listed in Table 1.

Un (a), L(1/1) (b), and L(3/1) (c) samples.

Typical wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) profiles of the Un,
L(1/1), and L(3/1) samples are shown in Figure 2. The diffraction peaks of α(110),
β(300), α(040), α(130), β(311)/α(131),
and α(041), corresponding to 2θ values of 14.1, 16.1,
16.9, 18.6, 21.1, and 21.8°, were marked on the WAXD curves.
The content of β-crystal (Kβ) was calculated according to eq 2 (in Section 4.3.4), and the results are listed in Table 1. In addition, the content of β-TC
(Kβ-TC) can be obtained according
to the following equation, which has been fully discussed in our previous
work46 1  where Kβ-Un is the content of β-crystal
in the Un sample and r is the thickness ratio of
the iPP and β-iPP layers, listed
in Table 1. The results
of Kβ-TC are approximations,
which were calculated by assuming that the content of β-crystal
in the β-iPP layer is equal to Kβ-Un.

Figure 2 WAXD patterns of the Un, L(1/1), and L(3/1) samples: the testing
plane was the YZ plane.

As can be seen from the calculated data in Table 1, the content of β-crystal
in these
three samples was around 80%, but the content of β-TC presented
a large difference. The content of β-TC in the Un sample was
0 because only β-spherulites were observed. The L(1/1) sample
contained 35.5% of β-TC, whereas 64.7% of β-TC remained
in the L(3/1) sample. The significant variance in the contents of
β-TC made it convenient to investigate the phase transformation,
structural evolution, and toughening mechanism of β-TC.

2.2 Tensile Properties
To compare the
effect of β-TC contents on the mechanical properties of the
Un and layered samples, tensile tests were performed, at a strain
rate of 50 mm/min. The stress–strain curves of the Un, L(1/1),
and L(3/1) samples are presented in Figure 3, and the corresponding results, including
the yield strength (σy) and elongation at break (ε),
are listed in Table 1. The layered samples showed a much higher elongation at break than
that of the Un sample. We thought that the great improvement in toughness
without sacrificing the strength was ascribed to the phase transformation
of β-TC. In addition, the stress–strain curves in Figure 3 show that the strain
where the cold drawing occurred (as denoted by arrows in Figure 4) was different for
the Un, L(1/1), and L(3/1) samples. The L(3/1) sample had the highest
cold-drawing strain (about 75%) due to its highest content of β-TC,
which was perpendicular to the stretching direction and needed a high
strain to change its orientation.

L(1/1), and L(3/1) samples
and a partially enlarged view of the low strain obtained during tensile
tests at a strain rate of 50 mm/min. The stars represent the breaking
points, and the arrows denote the beginning of cold drawing.

2.3 Phase
Transformation of β-TC
To investigate the phase transformation
of the β-crystal under
various strains, polymorphic compositions of the Un and layered samples
were detected by WAXD measurements. The dumbbell-shaped specimens
were first stretched to definite strains, that is, 0, 10, 30, 50,
60, 75, 100, 200, 300, 500, 650, and 700%, and then removed from the
fixture immediately after unloading the stress. The sampling position
of the specimens was the maximum deformation region before cold drawing
and the necking region after cold drawing. The recording curves of
WAXD measurements are shown in Figure 4. The diffraction peaks of α(110), β(300),
α(040), and α(130), corresponding to 2θ values of
14.1, 16.1, 16.9, and 18.6°, are marked in Figure 4. Cold drawing of the Un, L(1/1), and L(3/1)
samples occurred at 50, 60, and 75% strain, respectively. Before cold
drawing, the diffraction peaks representing the α- and β-crystals
of all samples remained unchanged, indicating that no obvious phase
transformation occurred. However, the variation in these diffraction
peak intensities was diverse after cold drawing. In the Un sample,
the peaks of β(300) decreased gradually with an increase in
strain and remained at a high intensity until breaking (about 100%
strain). In addition, broad diffraction peaks at 15°, which represent
the smectic mesophase (see the blue arrows in Figure 4), were obviously observed but overlapped
with the peak of α(110) at 14.1°. The variations in the
α-crystal and smectic mesophase peaks will be discussed after
peak fitting. In the layered samples (seeing Figure 4b,c), the peaks of β(300) decreased
rapidly and disappeared eventually after cold drawing. The peak intensities
of the α-crystal increased significantly; at the same time,
weak peaks of the smectic mesophase emerged.

Un (a), L(1/1) (b), and L(3/1) (c) samples
with various tensile strains. The testing plane was the YZ plane. The blue arrows denote the position of the smectic mesophase.

To accurately calculate the polymorphic
compositions in stretched
specimens, a peak fitting procedure was performed using of the PeakFit
software. Details of the peak fitting procedure are available in the Supporting Information, and exemplary results
of peak fitting are shown in Figure S1.
After peak fitting, the fractions of α-, β-, smectic,
and amorphous phases were calculated and are shown as a function of
the tensile strains in Figure 5. The degrees of crystallinity extracted from each WAXD pattern
are shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information).
The fractions of β-crystals of all samples were slightly changed
before cold drawing and decreased rapidly after cold drawing. Compared
with the Un sample, the fractions of β-crystal in the layered
samples were very lower. Not surprisingly, the relevant fractions
of α-crystal and the smectic mesophase of all samples were almost
unchanged before cold drawing and increased after cold drawing. As
for the amorphous phase, the fractions of all samples increased slightly
(about 5%) during stretching. Considering that an increase in the
amorphous phase occurred in all samples, the amorphization process
was not the main factor causing the layered samples to have a higher
elongation at break.

Figure 5 Variations in the β-crystal (a), α-crystal
(b), smectic
mesophase (c), and amorphous fractions (d) as a function of the tensile
strains in the Un, L(1/1), and L(3/1) samples, respectively.

In the Un sample, the fraction
of α-crystals increased slightly
(3.2%), whereas the fraction of the smectic mesophase increased by
17.5%. This indicated that the β-crystal in the Un sample was
mostly transformed into the smectic mesophase, which is in agreement
with other reports.37−39 However, in layered samples, the decrease in β-crystals
was accompanied by a significant increase in α-crystals and
a slight increase in the smectic and amorphous phases. In the L(1/1)
sample, the fractions of the α-crystal and smectic mesophase
samples increased by 21.9 and 12.3%, respectively, whereas the fractions
of the α-crystal and smectic mesophase in the L(3/1) sample
increased by 30.9 and 12.1%, respectively. Considering that the β-iPP
layers were composed of β-spherulites, which were mainly transformed
into the mesophase, the difference between fractions of the α-crystal
and smectic mesophase in the iPP layers, which was composed of β-TC,
must be bigger. In other words, the fraction of α-crystals was
much higher than the fraction of the smectic mesophase in the iPP
layers. Therefore, it can be concluded that β-TC tended to transform
into an α-crystal during stretching.

The β–α
transformation is more beneficial in
improving the toughness than the β-to-smectic transformation
because the α-crystal is more stable than the smectic mesophase.21−25,47 This caused the layered samples
to have a higher elongation at break. In addition, the fractions of
β-crystals in the layered samples decreased (38.7 and 47.3%
for L(1/1) and L(3/1) samples, respectively) much more than those
in the Un sample (25.7%). The increase in the phase transformation
rate is another reason to improve the toughness of the layered samples.

2.4 Structural Evolution of β-TC during
Tensile Deformation
The special phase transformation of β-TC
should certainly be accompanied by a special structural evolution
process during tensile deformation, as these two are coupled processes.36−42 In this section, the crystalline
orientation of the Un and L(1/1) samples during stretching was first
investigated by two-dimensional (2D)-WAXD measurements. The patterns
of the stretched samples as a function of strain are shown in Figure 6, and the testing
surface was the XY plane parallel to the layered
interface. In the original patterns of the Un and L(1/1) samples (strain
= 0%), the β(300) reflections were very strong because the fraction
of β-crystals was much higher than that of α-crystals.
Before cold drawing, all reflection rings (except β(300) of
L(1/1), 30%, and L(1/1), 50%) were uniform, indicating that the α-
and β-crystals were isotropic, without a preferred orientation.
The calculated Hermann’s orientation parameters (f) for α(110) and β(300) of the Un and L(1/1) samples
before cold drawing are listed in Table S2. The orientations at the meridian originated from movement of the
diagonal lamellae of β-TC (the lamellae have a certain angle
with the stretching direction), which separated and tilted to the
stretching direction, with molecular chains perpendicular to the stretching
direction. After cold drawing, intensification of some of the reflection
rings concentrated at the equator and off-equatorial region was observed,
indicating the occurrence of a crystalline orientation. With reference
to the WAXD results, it can be concluded that the crystalline orientation
and phase transformation were synchronous during stretching. However,
the orientation of the β-crystals and their transformation in
the Un and L(1/1) samples were different.

Figure 6 Two-dimensional WAXD
patterns of the Un sample (a) and L(1/1) sample
(b) as a function of strain: the testing plane was the XY plane parallel to the layered interfaces and the stretching direction
was vertical. The red arrows denote the positions of β(300)
reflections.

The uniformity of the
rings of β(300) in the Un sample was
preserved even at a high strain, indicating that β-crystals
were isotropic during the stretching. This phenomenon has
been reported by Pawlak, who thought that chain slips compensated
for the effect of lamellar rotation under stress.48 In addition, two broad spots and four spots appeared on
the equator and in the off-equatorial region after cold drawing, respectively,
which corresponded to the feature of the mesophase.49 However, in the L(1/1) sample,
the β(300) reflections were weakened gradually and the intensities
concentrated at the equator when the tensile strain was higher than
200%, indicating the orientation of the β-crystals under intensified
stress. Meanwhile, the reflections corresponding to the α-crystal
were concentrated at equatorial positions and the intensities increased
with an increase in tensile strain (from arcs to spots).

Similar
to the WAXD measurements, the 2D-WAXD results showed that
after cold drawing the β-crystals in the Un sample were mainly
transformed to the smectic mesophase but the β-crystals in the
L(1/1) sample tended to be transformed to α-crystals. Importantly,
the newly formed crystals, including the smectic and α phases,
were oriented with their chains parallel to the stretching direction,
and the orientation of the newly formed α-crystals in the L(1/1)
sample increased with an increase in tensile strain.

As mentioned
above, when all samples were stretched to 100%, the
fraction of their β-crystals decreased to a very low value.
However, Un sample fracture occurred once the strain exceeded 100%,
whereas the L(1/1) sample could be stretched to about 700%. Therefore,
the phase transformation of β-crystals was not the main factor
causing the layered samples to have a higher elongation at break.
To further investigate the toughening mechanism, all samples were
stretched to 100% and investigated by POM and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) measurements. During stretching, the narrow sections of the
dumbbell-shaped specimens underwent inhomogeneous deformation. For
convenience of investigation, the stretched specimens were divided
into three positions, that is, the non-necking (NN), transition (T),
and necking (N) regions, as illustrated in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Schematic representation of the different positions
of the dumbbell-shaped
specimens, which were stretched to 100%. NN, T, and N represent the
non-necking, transition, and necking regions, respectively. T1, T2,
and T3 were different areas of the T region.

First, the three regions of the Un and L(1/1) samples with
the
undeformed original samples were detected by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) measurements for the purpose of locating the position
at which the transformation of the β-crystal started. The DSC
melting curves of the undeformed original samples and different regions
of the Un and L(1/1) samples, with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min,
are recorded in Figure 8. Compared with those in the original samples, the fusion peaks of
the β-crystal remained unchanged in the NN region and started
to decrease in the T region. In the N
region, the fusion peaks of the β-crystal disappeared and only
broad peaks representing the α-crystal or smectic mesophase
were left. It can be proved that stress-induced transformation of
the β-crystal started in the T region. The degrees of crystallinity
extracted from DSC measurements of the Un and L(1/1) samples are listed
in Table S3.

Figure 8 (a) DSC melting curves
of different regions in the Un sample and
(b) DSC melting curves of different regions in the L(1/1) sample,
at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min.

Figures 9 and 10 show POM photographs of different regions of the
stretched Un and L(1/1) samples, respectively. It could be found that
the crystalline morphology of the T region, which was divided into
T1, T2, and T3 areas, changed gradually from NN to N. In the Un sample,
the content of β-spherulites decreased, whereas the crystalline
orientation increased, and eventually, a fibrous crystalline structure
was formed in the N region. In the L(1/1) sample, β-TC gradually
disappeared, but it was not converted to the fibrous structure when
the strain was 100%. Figure 10g shows that a fibrous crystalline structure similar to that
in Figure 9f was formed
in the N region at a strain of 700%. These changes led to variations
in the brightness in different regions. However, it was necessary
that the SEM observation with the higher resolution be employed to
investigate details of the crystalline morphology and structural evolution.

Figures 11 and 12 show SEM
photographs of different regions of the
stretched Un and L(1/1) samples, which were etched to remove the amorphous
phase before SEM observation. For the Un sample, few crazes extending
perpendicularly to the stretching direction were observed in the amorphous
phase of the non-necking region (see Figure 11a), but they did not break the lamellae
of the β-spherulites. The number of vertical crazes increased
with an increase in deformation in the T1 area, as shown in Figure 11b. Some vertical
crazes ran across β-spherulites and led to breakage of the horizontal
lamellae (red circles in Figure 11b), whereas the vertical lamellae still remained intact.
Phase transformation of the β-crystals could be triggered by
the breakage of the β lamellae;21 thus, the fragments of the horizontal lamellae were first transformed
into other stable phases (red circles in Figure 11c) in the T2 area, which appeared darker
than the β lamellae in SEM photographs because the newly formed
phases were difficult to etch. At the same time, the diagonal β
lamellae were stretched to break with an increase in deformation (yellow
circle in Figure 11c). These led to the disintegration of β-spherulites. In the
T3 area (seeing Figure 11d), intact spherulites were no longer observed; even the vertical
lamellae were broken into fragments, and most of the β-crystals
were transformed into other phases. Figure 11e shows that the β lamellae almost
disappeared in the N region. On the basis of the POM result (seeing Figure 9f), it can be inferred
that these lamellar fragments formed the highly oriented fibrous structure
parallel to the stretching direction when the strain was 100%; therefore,
Un sample fracture occurred when the strain was higher than 100%.

diagonal lamellae.

the diagonal lamellae of β-TC, and the white lines denote the
interfaces between the iPP and β-iPP layers.

Figure 12 shows
photographs of β-TC in different regions of the L(1/1) sample
under 100% strain, obtained from SEM. In the non-necking region (seeing Figure 12a), the lamellae
of β-TC were almost perpendicular to the stretching direction
and no horizontal lamellae were found. Some crazes existed in the
amorphous phase between vertical lamellae. Figure 12b shows that the morphology and structure
of β-TC in the T1 area did not change compared to those in the
non-necking region. The lamellae of β-TC remained
intact without breakage, whereas the horizontal lamellae of β-spherulites
were already stretched to break in this area, as shown in Figure 11b. Figure 12c shows that there existed
some diagonal lamellae in β-TC, which were broken and separated
by some vertical crazes (see the yellow circle) when the observation
zone of SEM was located in the T2 area. These broken diagonal lamellae
of β-TC were transformed into other phases in the T3 area (see
the yellow circle in Figure 12d). At the same time, the vertical lamellae of β-TC
were broken into fragments with an increase in deformation. In the
N region (see Figure 12e), all broken β-TCs almost disappeared, but the newly formed
α lamellar fragments did not rearrange along the stretching
direction according to the result, as shown in Figure 10f. Therefore, it could be concluded that
rearrangement of these fragments along the stretching direction, which
was accompanied by continuous absorption of energy during stretching,
would occur in the N region after the strain was higher than 100%.
This led to a very high elongation at break of the L(1/1) sample.

On the basis of the above observation, there were two main differences
between β-spherulite and β-TC, which were related to the
structural evolution of β lamellae. (1) First, the horizontal
lamellae, which were parallel to the direction of the tensile force,
were stretched to break and phase transformation occurred, followed
by the diagonal lamellae and vertical lamellae. From this, it can
be concluded that crystalline fracture and phase transformation of
β-spherulites occurred prior to those of β-TC, which had
no horizontal lamellae. (2) After the breakage
of the β-spherulites and phase transformation, rearrangement
of the crystalline fragments along the stretching direction occurred
quickly because of the shorter lamellar length and existence of plenty
of horizontal lamellae, whose fragments did not need to be rearranged
along the stretching direction. Compared to those from β-spherulites,
the crystalline fragments from β-TC would be rearranged along
the stretching direction at a much higher strain.

2.5 Toughening Mechanism
At present,
numerous studies on the toughening mechanism of β-crystals were
focused on the deformation process of β-spherulites;36−42 moreover, improvement in the toughness of β-iPP was ascribed
to a mechanical stress-induced phase transformation.33−35
The toughening mechanism of β-TC is still unknown. On the basis
of the above experimental results, a schematic representation of the
structural evolution of β-TC during uniaxial stretching is depicted
in Figure 13, to explain
the toughening mechanism of β-TC.

Figure 13 Schematic representation
of the structural evolution of β-TC
during uniaxial stretching.

During stretching, the lamellae of β-TC, which were
arranged
almost perpendicularly to the stretching direction, were deformed
in sequence: (1) First, the molecular chains of the amorphous phase
between β-lamellae were oriented along the stretching direction.
This led to the separation of β-lamellae, but the β-lamellae
were not destroyed. (2) Because of the different stress states,
the diagonal lamellae of β-TC were first stretched to break
with an increase in deformation, whereas the vertical β-lamellae
still remained intact. (3) Breakage of the diagonal
β-lamellae would mainly trigger β–α transformation,
and the vertical β-lamellae were broken at the same time by
intensified stress. (4) Similar to the diagonal β-lamellae,
the broken vertical β-lamellae predominantly transformed into
α-crystals. The phase transformation of β-TC was different
from that of β-spherulites, which mainly transformed into the
smectic mesophase. The β–α transformation
led to a greater improvement in toughness than the β-to-smectic
transformation because the α-crystal was more stable than the
smectic mesophase.21−25,47 (5) The lamellar fragments rearranged
along the stretching direction and finally formed a fibrous crystalline
structure, with their c axes parallel to the stretching
direction. The rearrangement of fragments was accompanied by continuous
absorption of energy, which caused β-TC to show a greater improvement
in toughness than β-spherulites.

3 Conclusions
In this work, β-nucleated polypropylene and polypropylene
were coextruded to prepare layered samples with various contents of
β-TC. Compared with the Un sample, containing only β-spherulites,
the layered samples showed a much higher elongation at break. During
stretching, β-TC intended to transform into an α-crystal,
and the transformation degree of β-TC was much higher than that
of β-spherulites. There were two main differences between β-spherulite
and β-TC, which were related to the structural evolution of β
lamellae. (1) For β-spherulites, first, the horizontal lamellae,
which were parallel to the direction of the tensile force, were stretched
to break and phase transformation occurred, followed by the diagonal
lamellae and vertical lamellae. There were only diagonal and vertical
lamellae in β-TC. This indicated that crystalline fracture and
phase transformation of the β-spherulites occurred prior to
those of β-TC. (2) After breakage and phase transformation of
the lamellae of β-spherulites, rearrangement of the crystalline
fragments along the stretching direction occurred quickly because
of the shorter lamellar length and existence of plenty of horizontal
lamellae, whose fragments did not need to be rearranged along the
stretching direction. Compared to those from β-spherulite, the
crystalline fragments from β-TC would finish rearranging along
the stretching direction at a much higher strain. In conclusion, the
special β–α phase transformation and high degree
of transformation and rearrangement of the lamellar fragments caused
the layered samples with a high content of β-TC to show a greater
improvement in toughness than the Un sample with β-spherulites.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Commercially
available
iPP, purchased from Yangzi Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China),
with a melt flow rate of 2.9 g/10 min (230 °C/2.16 kg), was adopted
as the basal resin. The rare earth β-NA used in this work, marked
as WBG, was kindly supplied by GuangDong Winner Functional Materials
(Foshan, Guangdong, China). It has a general formula of CaxLa1–x(LIG1)m(LIG2)n, where x and 1 – x are the proportions
of Ca2+ and La3+ in the complex, whereas LIG1
and LIG2 are a dicarboxylic acid- and amide-type ligands with coordination
numbers of m and n, respectively.50

4.2 Specimen Preparation
To achieve the
desired loading and good dispersion of small amounts of nucleating
agents in iPP, a master batch of iPP with 1 wt % WBG was first prepared
using a twin-screw extruder. Then, the master batch was diluted with
neat iPP to obtain the β-iPP sample containing 0.3 wt % WBG.
The mixing temperature gradient was varied between 170 and 200 °C
from hopper to die.

A schematic representation of microlayered
coextrusion is shown in Figure 14a, and the layered structure is shown in Figure 14b, where the iPP
and β-iPP layers are arranged alternately along the Z direction and are parallel to the extrusion direction
(Y direction). The detailed preparation process is
described in our previous work.46 To obtain
64-layer samples with different β-TC contents, the thickness
ratios of the iPP and β-iPP layers were controlled to about
1:1 and 3:1 by changing the rotation speed of the extruders. Un with
the same β-NA content as that in the β-iPP layer were
also prepared for comparison with the layered samples. To eliminate
the effect of thermal history on crystallization, all samples were
thermally treated at 250 °C for 10 min and then isothermally
crystallized at 130 °C.

4.3 Characterization
and Testing
4.3.1 DSC
Crystalline
analysis of the
samples was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere using the DSC instrument
(Q20, TA Instrument). For each test, a sample, ranging in weight from
7 to 8 mg, was heated from 40 to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min
and the melting process was recorded.

4.3.2 POM
An approximately 15 μm
thin slice was obtained from the sample using a microtome in the YZ plane shown in Figure 14b, and the crystalline morphologies were observed on
a POM (BX51, OLYMPUS) equipped with a crossed polarizer.

4.3.3 SEM
The microscopic structure of
stretched samples was characterized using an SEM (JSM-5900LV, Japan)
with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The samples were first trimmed
with a microtome in the YZ plane shown in Figure 14b, and then, the
surface was etched for 24 h with an etchant (about 100 mL) containing
1.3 wt % potassium permanganate (KMnO4), 32.9 wt % concentrated
sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and 65.8 wt % concentrated
phosphoric acid (H3PO4), according to the procedure
proposed by Olley and Bassett.51 Before
SEM characterizations, the surfaces of all of the samples were coated
with a thin layer of gold by ion sputtering.

4.3.4 WAXD
To characterize the content
of β-crystals in the specimens, WAXD measurements were performed
on a DX2500 (Liuzhou Zinc Products Co., Ltd., China) X-ray diffractometer
in the reflection mode, using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542
Å), operated at 40 kV and 25 mA under ambient temperature. The
scattered intensities were registered to range from scattering angles
of 5 to 35°. The test surface was the YZ plane
shown in Figure 14b, and the X-ray beam, with a diameter 5 mm, could cover all layers
of the layered samples. The content of β-crystals (Kβ) can also be calculated from the following equations52 2  Where Aα(110), Aα(040), and Aα(130) are the areas of the (110), (040), and (130)
reflection peaks of the α-crystal at 2θ = 14.1, 16.9,
and 18.6°, respectively, and Aβ(300) is the area of the (300) reflection peak of the β-crystal
at 2θ = 16.1°.

To characterize the crystalline orientation
of the specimens, 2D-WAXD measurements were made on a D8 discovers
(Bruker, Germany) X-ray diffractometer equipped with a 2D area detector
(VANTEC500), in the transmission mode, using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.542 Å), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Meanwhile,
the scattered intensities were registered in the range of scattering
angles from 5 to 45°, with a scanning velocity of 0.03°/s
and a step size of 0.02°. Different from that in one-dimensional
WAXD measurements, the test surface was the XY plane
shown in Figure 14b, to ensure all layers of the layered samples were detected in the
transmission mode.

4.3.5 Tensile Measurements
The dumbbell-shaped
specimens for tensile tests were cut from the middle of the extruded
samples that had been thermally treated, as described in Section 4.2. Detailed dimensions
of the dumbbell-shaped specimens are presented in Figure 14c, and the thickness of all
specimens was close to 2 mm. For each sample, the reported average
value was derived from at least five specimens. The tensile tests
were performed on a SANS CMT4104 testing machine (Shenzhen, China)
at a strain rate of 50 mm/min according to ASTM D638. The tensile
direction was parallel to the extrusion direction (Y direction).
