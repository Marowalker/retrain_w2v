A new
series of dicarboxylic derivatives of bispidines have been
synthesized to develop novel copper(II) complexes suitable as imaging
agents for positron emission tomography. For characterization purposes,
copper complexes of bispidines were synthesized in the pure form and
in quantitative yields by neutralization of ligands with malachite.
The formation of complexes and their stoichiometries were studied
by potentiometric titration, cyclic voltammetry, and spectroscopic
methods. The stability constants were found to be fairly suitable
for copper cation fixation inside dianionic chelate molecules.

Introduction
Positron emission tomography
(PET) is one of the most widely used
molecular imaging methods, which enables early and high-resolution
diagnosis of various diseases, including oncological, neurological,
and cardiological diseases. Among the PET radionuclides, fluorine-18
is regarded as an “ideal” PET radionuclide, with optimum
nuclear-physical characteristics (97% β+, 3% E.C., E(β+)max = 0.635 MeV). However,
in recent years a growing interest in new radiopharmaceuticals (RPs)
with nonconventional PET radionuclides, for example, 86Y (14.7 h), 89Zr (78.4 h), 64Cu (12.7 h), and
other radiometals, has been observed.1−5 This is motivated by their longer half-life periods, which enable
tracing of processes with relatively slow pharmaceutical kinetics.
These RPs could be applied to estimate the efficiency of radioimmunotherapy
using labeled intact monoclonal antibodies and their fragments as
well as so-called engineered protein (affibody, diabody, nanobody,
etc.) antibodies and their fragments, whose biological action lasts
from a few hours to a few days.6

Among copper isotopes, four (60Cu, 61Cu, 62Cu, 64Cu) are considered potential medical positron
emitters.7,8 The results obtained using these agents
for visualizing solid hypoxic tumors or their parts (60,62,64Cu-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)
(60,62,64Cu-ATSM)) and choosing the therapy and estimating
its efficiency, as well as in cardiologic (myocardial perfusion, 62Cu-pyruvaldehyde-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone))
and, more rarely, neurological examinations are summarized in an overview.964Cu is the most interesting copper
isotope because it manifests the smallest average energy of positrons,
almost does not emit high-energy γ-quanta, and has a half-life
that allows the radionuclide to be delivered to clinics within a region. 64Cu could be produced in 64Ni(p,n)64Cu with a high yield, of up to 5.9 GBq/μA (irradiation parameter
3 μA and 1 h of bombardment), and high purity using common medical
cyclotrons.10 Alternative ways of 64Cu production are described in the recent review on nonconventional
PET radionuclides.11

Unlike the incorporation
conventional PET radionuclides, incorporation
of metal isotopes requires the use of bifunctional chelating agents
that, in turn, can form covalent bonds with various biomolecules,
with a high specificity and selectivity toward certain targets.3 For this, elaboration of easily modified ligand
systems (bifunctional chelators) with a high affinity toward metal
cations as well as with wide possibilities of chemical modifications,
including conjugation to biological vectors, is required. Only ligands
that can provide an essential kinetic inertness combined with a high
thermodynamic stability are interesting in this respect.4 The known examples of copper(II) chelates studied
in vitro and in vivo lack either kinetic or thermodynamic stability.12 The task of attaching the vector group to the
radiolabeling moiety is often difficult to solve synthetically.

For PET diagnostics with Cu isotopes, the most useful ligands are
tetrazamacrocyclic compounds, such as ATSM, cyclen, cyclam, 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrayltetra-acetic
acid (DOTA), and diamsar (Figure 1). In this article, we start to explore the series
of diazabicycles as a central component of the potentially useful
ligand families. Some of our previous work on diazamonocycles and
bicycles have already been published (piperazines,14−16 homopiperazines,17 bispidines,18,19). A promising
approach is to explore chelate (Figure 2, top and middle) and macrocycle (Figure 2, bottom) effects. This could
be achieved at the ligand-design stage, which includes the choice
of the central diazacore, the nature (Q’s) and length (k’s)
of the pendant arms, and that of the cyclizing bridge (n’s).
In the context of this challenge, we noted with interest complexes
of tetradentate bispidine-based ligands, studied mostly by Comba et
al.20−36 Recently, bispidines themselves proved to be privileged structures
in medicinal chemistry.37 The rigid framework
of bispidines in double-chair conformation allows them to be used
to study the binding of small cations for a long time.38 This class of preorganized acyclic ligands is
similar to the well-known cyclohexyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (CHX-DTPA) because rigidity of the acyclic fragment is achieved
by partial cyclization. CHX-DTPA is used for complexation of trivalent
cations like Bi3+, rare earth elements in conjugates with
monoclonal antibodies39,40 because it provides an optimal
set of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the complexes formed.

experiments. Bidentate N2-chelating diazacores (top), tetradentate

and macrocyclic tetradentate N2Q2 systems (bottom).

Bispidines form very stable complexes
with Cu2+, which
can be modified to bind with biomolecules, such as enzymes, for target
delivery.21,23,24,30,32 As a vast majority
of these bispidines belong to chelating macrocycles of neutral N4, N5, and N6 types,24,26,33,36,41 they form positively charged complexes with Cu2+. This means that there is a necessity to use counteranions
to compensate for the positive charge of the complex.

However,
the simplest tetradentate ligand is bispidine of the N2O2 type (see Figure 2, middle right, Q = O), which possesses a rigid preorganized
structure to form highly stable neutral complexes with Cu2+. 19

In the solid
state, the metal ion, Cu2+, has a typical
coordination number of 5 (corresponding to a distorted square-pyramidal
coordination polyhedron), comprising two nitrogens from the bispidine
backbone, two oxygens from the carboxylic residues, and an oxygen
atom from the solvent molecule or a neighboring complex.

Bispidine-type
ligands can be easily modified to fulfill a task
of attaching to the desired vector of biological object. Indeed, these
molecules possess at least two sites that can be used for conjugation
with biomolecules (see Figure 1, bottom right): (a) if X = OH and Y = H, then the hydroxyl
could be modified to carbamate33 or propargyl
ether moieties; if XY = O, then the carbonyl could be reduced to a
hydroxyl moiety42 and all of the possibilities
for hydroxyl functionalization are then applied; moreover, the bispidinic
carbonyl group is known to form hydantoins.43−45 (b) R groups
could have linkable residues like SH, COOH, OH,46 and so on.

This article describes the synthesis of
N2O2-type tetradentate bispidines differing
in their substituents at
position 9 (hereafter called “C9”) (Figure 3) and their respective copper
complexes. The intention behind the synthesis of the target structures, 2a–c, 3b, and 3c, was as
follows: (1) to study the influence of a substituent at C9 on the
stability and synthetic availability of the complex and (2) to study
the possible influence of a substituent in the pendant arm (H vs Me
in pairs 2b/3b and 2c/3c) on complex stability. Basic copper carbonate (malachite)
was applied as a copper source in the syntheses of complexes 4b, 4c, 5b, and 5c from
ligands 2b, 2c, 3b, and 3c, respectively.

Figure 3 Structures of organic compounds studied and/or
discussed in this
work, with their numbering. The inset shows the numbering of carbon
atoms in 2a as an example.

The structures of the complexes were confirmed by UV–vis
and IR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. We compared the formation
and stability of copper complexes of our target molecules, 2a–c, 3b, and 3c, with
those of N,N′-unsubstituted analogues 1a and 1c and carboxyl-containing analogues 2d and 2e using potentiometric titration and cyclic voltammetry (CV).

Results
and Discussion
Ligand Synthesis
Compounds 2a–c, 3b, and 3c were synthesized starting
from urotropine and diethyl ketone by applying known sequences (Scheme 1).18,19,26,30,47−49 Alkylation of compounds 1a–c was performed using different alkylating
agents. Whereas the reactions with chloroacetic acid for the preparation
of unbranched compounds 2a–c proceeded
readily, the reactions with racemic 2-chloropropionic acid for the
preparation of products 3b–c were
rather slow, that is, the conversions at 3 h did not exceed 50%. Thus,
2-bromopropionic acid was used instead of the chloro analogue, giving
complete conversion after 3 h. Another point to be mentioned here
is the excellent solubility of target compounds 2 and 3 in water, which is a very good property for administration
to organisms but makes ligand separation from the reaction mixtures
difficult. To overcome this problem, we used a known synthetic procedure
for separation, which includes precipitation of the barium salt of
the target compound and exclusion of the barium cation using diluted
sulfuric acid.30 The overall yield of the
alkylation step is quite moderate (30–50%). Considering the
alkylation efficiency (by means of NMR) and efficiency of barium precipitation
as barium sulfate (100%), one can conclude that the maximum loss of
target ligands 2 and 3 occurred at the barium
salt precipitation stage. Presumably, the main reason for this loss
is the quite good solubility of barium salt of ligands in water especially
in the case of ligands 3b and 3c.

Checking the
spectroscopic properties of the ligands, we found
the presence of ketone-gem-diol equilibrium for compounds 2b and 3b (Scheme 2). For example, compound 2b in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 solution has only
one set of resonances that is consistent with its structure. In contrast,
in aqueous solution two sets of signals corresponding to ketone 2b (δ(13C(9)) = 212.03 ppm) and geminal diol 2b′ (δ(13C(9)) = 93.71 ppm) are observed
(Figure S29).

Scheme 2 Ketone-gem-diol Equilibrium in Water
In a room temperature equilibrium mixture, the 2b/2b′ ratio is about 0.9:1.0. Upon heating to
60 °C,
the ratio changes to ∼1.8:1.0, reducing to the starting position
after cooling to rt (Figure 4). An analogous hydration reaction was described for quaternary
ammonium salts of 5,7-dimethyl-1,3-diazaadamantan-6-one in D2O50 and for bispidine platinum complexes.51 Commonly, the behavior of compound 3b in D2O is similar (Figure S31) to that of the glycine analogue, 2b, described above.
The main difference is the presence of two pairs of diastereomers
for 3b and 3b′, whose signals are
clearly different in the 13C spectrum. In the rac-form (C2 symmetry) framework, the carbons
of ketone and gem-diol that were located at opposite
sites were pairwise equivalent (C2 and C6, C4 and C8, C1 and C5). This
is also true for respective methyl groups and substituents at nitrogen
atoms. For the meso-form (the symmetry plane passes
through the C1, C9, and C5 atoms),
carbon atoms C2 and C8 and C4 and
C6 are pairwise equivalent but atoms C1 and
C5 with methyl groups are nonequivalent and have paired
signals of equal intensities in the 13C spectrum. Thus,
the diastereomeric ratio rac-/meso- can be approximated as 1:0.8. The 1H NMR spectrum of
this mixture is more complicated because of strong overlapping of
signals (Figure S30). However, the CCH3 signals of 3b and 3b′ appear
as singlets of the rac-form and a pair of singlets
of the meso-form. If one considers the CCH3 groups, signals of 3b′ appear at a higher field
(0.94 ppm) than those of 3b (1.02 ppm), and analogously
to the 2b/2b′ mixture, the 3b/3b′ ratio in D2O solution
is about 1.4:1.0. The protons of the framework of the methylene groups
of compound 1c in D2O solution belong to the ABCD system, where only three spin–spin coupling
constants (2JAB, 2JCD, and 4JAC) are not equal to zero. The difference in chemical
shifts in the first approximation allows us to analyze this spin system
as an AMPX system.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra of compound 2b in D2O (a), in D2O at 60 °C
(b), and in DMSO-d6 (c).

Probably, long-range spin–spin coupling
constants, 4JHH = 2.8 Hz, are
visible for
nonequivalent protons H2,4 and H6,8 (W-arrangement
of chemical bonds). In the 1H spectrum of 2c, H2,4 and H6,8 proton interaction is invisible
due to wider signals; so, NCH2 resonances can be considered
as a superposition of two AB systems (or as two pairs
of doublets). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of
compound 3c in D2O show the presence of a
mixture of two diastereomers in an ∼5:1 ratio (Figure S34). Their signals are clearly visible
in the 13C spectrum, but in the 1H spectrum,
the major diastereomer masks the signal of the minor diastereomer.
Because of the diastereotopy of NCH2 protons, their signals
are a superposition of four AB systems rather than of two, as for 1c and 2c. All four framework CH2N
carbons of both diastereomers (eight signals in 13C spectrum)
are also nonequivalent.

Copper Complex Preparation
Generally,
the synthesis
and application of 64Cu complexes in PET means application
of “wet” chemistry. Therefore one should concentrate
on the synthesis and study of appropriate solutions. However, to obtain
as much information about target complexes as possible, we have to
isolate them in the pure form and collect information on several characteristics
that are vital for their practical application, the first being their
chemical and electrochemical stabilities. The main methods for isolation
of the complex are (1) evaporation of the solvent after reaction of
a ligand and copper inorganic salt, followed by subsequent crystallization
of the copper complexes and (2) vapor diffusion of antisolvent into
the copper complex solution.30,36 Unfortunately, these
approaches were found to be ineffective for isolation of the compounds
under investigation because of their high solubility in water. Another
method for copper complex preparation is neutralization of freshly
prepared copper(II) hydroxide with an acidic N2O2-chelate.19 We performed the same reaction
with ligand 2b and proved that neutralization of acid 2b, followed by dissolution of Cu(OH)2, proceeds
instantly under ambient conditions.

However, the main drawback
of this method is the presence of inorganic salts, for example, KCl,
which contaminate the copper complex solution after reaction completion.
Thus, we suggest, for the first time, the use the malachite Cu(OH)2CO3 as a gravimetric form of Cu(OH)2 for copper–bispidine complex preparation, which has the advantages
of the absence of dehydration in air and the absence of contamination
products in the reaction (Scheme 3). Basic copper carbonate (malachite) reacts readily
with bispidines 2b, 2c, 3b,
and 3c in water at rt overnight (see the movie in the SI). All of the yields are quantitative. By this
new approach, four copper salts of 2,2′-(1,5-dimethyl-9-oxo-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-diyl)dicarboxylic
acids, 2b and 3b, and 2,2′-(1,5-dimethyl-9-hydroxy-3,7-diazabicyclo-[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-diyl)dicarboxylic
acids, 2c and 3c, were synthesized for the
first time.

Scheme 3 Copper Complex Preparation
Spectroscopy of Copper Complexes
Because of the paramagnetic
nature of Cu(II), no NMR spectra of sufficient quality can be registered
for bispidine complexes. Therefore, complex formation was studied
by comparison of the FTIR spectra of the complexes with those of the
free ligands (Figure 5). All ligands have characteristic vibrations at 1610–1620
cm–1 and 1710–1720 cm–1 of the C=O group, which are typical of the carboxylic acid
moiety30 (Figures 5 and S36). C=O
vibrations of the keto group are likely positioned under the carboxylic
C=O vibrations, giving coalescent peaks at 1610–1620
cm–1.30,52 It is interesting that
all ligands have quite similar peaks at ca. 1698–1726 cm–1. This is probably due to the rotational freedom of
carboxylic groups in free ligands, which leads to intramolecular hydrogen-bond
formation between one carboxylic group and a nitrogen atom or oxygen
atom of diol or secondary alcohol. The carboxylic groups became equivalent,
being rigidly fixed in the copper complexes. This conclusion is supported
by the presence of only one coalescent peak at 1595–1630 cm–1 for all copper complexes. The UV–vis spectra
of all copper salts are almost identical, with a weak metal-to-ligand
charge-transfer band at 602–612 nm and an adsorption band of
the ligand at 247–252 nm (Figure S37). Copper complexes were also studied in a methanol–water
mixture (1:1) by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry–electrospray
ionization (HRMS–ESI) spectrometry. In a solution of the ketone-containing
complex, 4b (Figure S38a),
cations of mononuclear CuL(H2O)H+ (m/z 364.06977) and binuclear complexes Cu2L2H+ (m/z 691.11143), Cu2L2(H2O)H+ (m/z 709.12237), and Cu2L2(H2O)2H+ (m/z 727.13281) are present (consider free ligands
as LH2). An analogous situation is observed for the hydroxyl-containing
complex, 4c (Figure S38b):
LH+ (m/z 287.16013),
CuLH+ (m/z 348.07404),
Cu2L2H+ (m/z 695.14155), and Cu2L2Na+ (m/z 717.12257). The presence
of binuclear cations in the mass spectra coincides with the structure
proposed by Comba et al. for complex 2a with copper(II)
on the basis of quantum chemical calculations and ESP spectroscopy
study.30

Electrochemical Study
As the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox reaction
is suggested as a driving force for radiocopper loss,53,54 a CV study on the redox stability of our Cu(II) complexes was carried
out. Earlier,19,55 we have studied the redox properties
of a series of Cu(II) complexes with the general formula LCuCl2 (L is 3,7-dialkyldiazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one) and of Cu(II)
complexes with tetradentate N2O2 ligands derived
from diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ones, including 2e and 3e. It was hypothesized that oxidation of the complexes with
N2-type bidentate ligands occurs at the lone pairs of the
nitrogen atoms, giving rise to CuCl2, whereas reduction
leads to electron transfer from the electrode to the copper atom,
both processes leading to decomposition of the complexes. In contrast,
in the case of N2O2-type tetradentate ligands,
high complementarity between the dianionic ligand and Cu(II) metal
was observed, which is attributed to their high reduction potentials
compared to those in the LCuCl2 series. Such complementarity
leads to increased stability of the Cu(II) complexes toward reduction.
In the present study, we examined the electrochemical properties of
complexes 4b, 4c, 5b, and 5c by CV in dimethylformamide (DMF) at a Pt electrode (Table 1) and compared the
results with the data published for complexes of ligands 2e and 3e.19

Oxidation
All investigated copper
complexes are irreversibly
oxidized. Anodic behavior is similar within the set of compounds 4b and 4c and 5b and 5c.

At the same time, electron transfer from complexes 4b and 4c and 5b and 5c is approximately 500 mV easier in comparison to that from their
phenyl analogue 5e. We assume that oxidation leads to
the formation of cation radicals, [LCu]+Ÿ, with
their consequent destruction to release free Cu2+ cations.
This has been proven by the fact that peaks corresponding to Cu2+/Cu+ (0.31 V) and Cu+/Cu2+ (0.58 V) are observed after the first scan from 0 to 1.5 V and vice
versa. Moreover, peaks at ∼1.0 V, probably corresponding to
oxidation and destruction of free organic cation radicals that were
formed after the release of Cu2+, are found in the anodic
part of the CV curve after several scans (Figure S40). Comparison of the anodic electrochemical behavior of 4b and 4c and 5b and 5c to that of 4e and 5e clearly demonstrates
the influence of substituents at positions 1 and 5 of the bicyclic
core on the electrochemical oxidation of complexes. At the same time,
substitution of a hydrogen atom for a methyl group in 4b/5b and 4c/5c does not influence
the electrochemical behavior of the complexes.

Reduction
Electrochemical reduction of complexes 4b and 4c and 5b and 5c occurs in two single-electron
stages with similar potentials (Table 1 and Figure 6). The first electron transfer
is irreversible and corresponds to Cu2+/Cu+ transition
within the chelate complex. The second quasireversible (EpRed – EpOx = 400 mV) peak corresponds to the formation of a [LCu0]−2 chelate complex similar to that of 4e and 5e. The absence of a desorption oxidation
peak in the range from −100 to +100 mV proves the absence of
oxidative desorption of copper from the electrode. This means that
the intermediate dianionic complexes, [LCu0]−2, are rather stable on the electrochemical time scale. This result
is in contrast to that obtained for complex 5e, for which
the first step is quasireversible and the second occurs at −2.46
V.

Potentiometric Study
It is known that N,N′-dimethylbispidine
has pKa = 11.88 in water.56 Determination
of the pKa of phenyl-substituted bispidines
in acetonitrile or DMSO by titration using organic acids, such as p-toluenesulphonic or methanesulphonic acids, has been discussed
in several papers.57,58 A correlation between these data
and the data from aqueous solutions is established.59 According to these data, phenyl substituents on C1 and
C5 lower the value of the acidity constant (pKa(DMSO) = 4.4) that have no further effects by carbomethoxy-functionalization
of N3 and N7. However, replacement of phenyl by benzyl increases the
pKa to 7.7, and addition of COOCH3 to C1 and C5 decrease the pKa by 2 orders (pKa(DMSO) = 5.3).57 Because the effects of functional groups at
the different sites of bispidine backbone on the acidity are not additive,
it seems reasonable to study the dependence of acidic properties as
well as the complexing ability of our target molecules on the position
of such substituents/groups.

Intensive, systematic research
on the modifications of the backbone of bispidines on addition of
pyridyl and picolyl groups to N3 and N7 and/or C2 and C4 has been
carried out earlier.23,31,60,61 It was shown that different combinations
of these substituents and sites of insertion can produce a wide range
of acidities, ∑pKa = 11–17.
These data could be explained by changes in the electron density on tertiary amines that are affected
by interference of a withdrawing effect of pyridyl groups and donation
by aliphatic substituents.31 However, the
stability of Cu(II)L with these ligands is not correlated to their
acidities because the stereochemistry of Cu(II) is mainly defined
by the Jahn–Teller distortion: for example, methylation of
the pyridine groups at the γ-position does not affect the acidity
but has a crucial increase on the stability of Cu(II)L, by ∼7
orders of magnitude.23 Protonation of the
ligands can be directly studied by potentiometric titration of aqueous
solutions. Aqueous solutions of 0.001 M ligand have a pH of ∼3–4;
addition of HClO4 with a known concentration is required
to make the pH ∼2.5. This contribution of HClO4 was
taken into account during calculation of constants. The results of
potentiometric titration of the ligands are summarized in Table 2.

As has been
mentioned in the introduction, polyaminopolycarboxylic
acids have already proven their usefulness in the chelation of cationic
radionuclides for the synthesis of RPs. However, information on bispidine-containing
carboxylic acids is limited in the available literature;30,62 thus, our investigation is adequately justified. In general, pendant
acetic groups increase the acidity of ligands, wherein larger carbon
chains distinguish between bispidines and bispidinones. According
to the calculated protonation constants (Table 2), the difference between 2b and 2c is 1 order and between 3b and 3c is the same, within the error. Literature data considering
the acidity of carboxyl-containing bispidines report structural similarity
between ligands 2d and 2e(62) and 2a and 2b. The protonation
constants for 2d, log K1H = 11.93 and log K2H = 16.12,
and 2e, log K1H =
10.38 and log K2H = 14.39, are
virtually identical to those calculated in this work for 2a and 2b.

The protonation ability of water-soluble
ligands is one of their
most important properties, which defines their complexation strength
with cations. At least a two-step protonation is established for all
ligands. Ligand 1b, with a carbonyl group at C9, demonstrates
the lowest value for the first step of protonation. Such an influence
of keto groups is traditionally associated with interaction of nitrogen’s
lone pairs of aminogroups and a carbonyl group, similarly to amides,63 due to through bond interaction between CO and
N’s.64−68 This leads to a decrease in the Ka of
bispidinones compared to that of bispidines by 4 orders of magnitude.31,57 The log K1H (1b)
value calculated in this work (Table 2) is correlated with an earlier obtained value of log K1H = 7.0 for this compound taking in consideration
the relation between the values determined in different solvents,
log K1H(H2O) = log K1H(DMSO) ± 1.5.57,59 Substitution of the keto functional group by an alcohol group in 1c results in an increase in the log K1H value by 2 orders. The second proton addition, with
log K1H – log K2H = 4 for all considered ligands, also correlates
with the second protonation step of pyridyl-containing bispidines,
log K1H – log K2H = 4.5–6.61,63 Protonation of the carboxylic groups in bispidines is expected to
occur at an acidic pH, similar to that of glycine in 2 and α-alanine in 3. However, it becomes possible
to determine the third step of protonation related to the carboxylic
group only for 3, log K3H – log K2H = 2.5–2.6.
The latter value is in good agreement with log KH(α-alanine) = 2.33.69 According to the ligand speciation diagrams, complete deprotonation
of the considered bispidines occurs at pH’s 7–9 (Figure 7).

and deprotonated forms of 1b (a) and 2b (b)

For complexation studies, a titrated
solution containing ligand
and Cu2+ at concentrations of 5–10 × 10–4 M was used. Hyperquad 2013 software was used to calculate
the complexation constants of CuL and CuL(OH)m. For calculation of the complexation constants, the protonation
constants of the ligands were obtained in this study and their hydrolysis
constants were taken from the literature.70

All considered ligands form complexes with Cu2+, which
is evident from the different titration curves obtained for the ligands
and the ligands in the presence of Cu2+ (Figure 8). The complexation constants
are correlated with the protonation constants, as seen from Table 2. The maximal equilibration
time for each experimental point was set as 5 min and was achieved
only at pH > 10, when insoluble CuO started to form.

= 2b.

Changes in colors and
changes in titration curves proceed very
fast (no more than 5 minutes). This fact indirectly confirms fast
complexation of Cu2+ by bispidines. Ligands 1b and 1c form two types of complexes, with M/L = 1:1
and 1:2 stoichiometries. The latter is confirmed by spectrophotometric
titration at pH 5.0 ± 0.1 (Figure 9a). On addition of Cu2+ to the ligand solution,
the absorption at 555–556 nm increases. The latter corresponds
to a complex with stoichiometry [L2Cu]2+, and
then, a bathochromic shift of the maximum occurs from c(Cu2+)/c(L) = 0.5 to c(Cu2+)/c(L) = 1 (Figure 9a inset). Moreover, the change in the maximum
absorption (Figure 9b) proves the formation of two types of complexes, [L2Cu]2+ and [LCu]2+. The possibility of formation
of [L2Cu]2+complexes was confirmed by us recently
by means of an X-ray study and an ESI mass-spectral study.18

Figure 9 (a) Absorption spectra upon spectrophotometric titration
and shift
in the maximum with Cu2+/L variation (inset), L = 1b. (b) Change in the absorption maximum with Cu2+/L variation, L = 1b.

During potentiometric titration, initially (at lower pH values),
the formation of [LCu]2+ takes place. Then, with an increase
in pH, a corresponding ligand deprotonation complex, [L2Cu]2+, forms, which at an alkaline pH transforms to the
hydroxoforms of the complex, [L2CuOH]+ and [L2Cu(OH)2] (Figure 10a). After titration, the solution is characterized
by the same purple color and possesses the same spectrum, with a maximum
at 555 nm, as those for [L2Cu]2+, which also
supports the idea of keeping the 1:2 stoichiometry for the hydroxide
forms. The same results are shown for 1c (Figures S21–S22 of the Supporting Information).
Recently,30 single crystals of Cu-2d have
been characterized, indicative of the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometry,
whereas by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular
mechanic structure optimization, the formation of dinuclear complexes
with a 2:2 stoichiometry has been suggested. Our results, that is,
1:1 complexation of copper with 2a–c, 3b, and 3c, are in line with those obtained from single-crystal
X-ray data in ref (30) and from the complexation study in ref (62). On the other hand, for ligands having carboxylic
groups as part of their structures, complex CuL is stable over a wide
pH range (Figure 10b). Furthermore, the value calculated for complex 4a coincides with that obtained from the literature, log K(2dCu) = 14.45.62 However, 4b is almost 3 orders less stable than 4e (log K = 16.02). Apparently, the
higher stability of 4e is attributed to phenyl substituents
at C1 and C5, which is in line with the results of our electrochemistry
study. It is noteworthy that substitution of glycine by α-alanine
does not influence the complexation with Cu2+, and despite
the difference in the protonation of carboxyl-containing ligands,
the generally stability of [LCu] remains unchanged (Table 2).

Figure 10 Distribution of Cu2+ (c = 5 ×
10–4 M) species in aqueous solutions (μ =
0.1 M NaClO4) in the presence of L (c =
1 × 10–3 M), as a function of pH: (a) L = 1b, (b) L = 2b.

Logarithms of the obtained stability constants are in the
ranges
of 13–14 and 19–21, which proves a high affinity of
bispidines to copper cations. The log KML values with carboxylate-containing bispidine are less than
that for known chelators like triethylenetetramine, DOTA, and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triyltriacetic
acid (log K = 21–234) but the known systems suffer from hard complexation conditions71−73 that are not always appropriate for vectors and despite high values
of log KCuL the known examples
lack the stability in the biologic medium.72,74,75 So, it is not evident that the overall stability
directly coincides with log KCuL. Complexation data for Sar-ligands with Cu2+ are limited
in the literature. For the first approximation, the obtained values,
especially for 1b and 1c, for “soft”
cations such as Cu2+ might be high enough for stability
in a biologic medium. As a following step, in vitro and in vivo stability
would be checked.

According to this study, carboxylic pendant
arms affect not only
the stoichiometry but also the stability of complexes of bispidines
with Cu2+. However, the stability of LCu tends to decrease
with growth of the carbon backbone in the pendant arm; thus, glycine
substituents seem to be optimal for further investigation.

Conclusions
In this article, we have shown that dicarboxylic derivatives of
bispidines are promising ligand systems for copper chelation, which
have potential applications in RPs for PET. The copper complexes with
N2O2-type ligands, 2 and 3, possess sufficient thermodynamic stability in aqueous solutions
and fast complexation kinetics, that is, they are formed at low concentrations,
at ambient temperatures, and in minimal time. Electrochemical study
shows good redox stability for complexes with N2O2 tetradentate dianionic ligands toward Cu(II)/Cu(I) reduction, which
makes them promising RP candidates against the redox systems present
in vivo. Another goal for our future investigations is the discovery
of methods to attach copper-binding ligands to the desired peptide
vectors or biological objects. For example, the presence of a hydroxyl
group at C9 in 2c and 3c allows the synthetic
modification of the ligands with short linkers, such as propargyl,
paving the way for triazole linker chemistry. So, the reactivity of
9-OH is currently under investigation in our labs. For their use in
RPs, bispidines will be studied from the point of view of radiolytic
stability to ensure that the conjugates retain their desired properties
during the entire procedure.

Materials and Methods
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 25
°C on Bruker Avance-400 and Bruker Avance-600 spectrometers.
Chemical shifts were referred to the signals of the deuterated solvents
(4.79 ppm for D2O, 7.26 and 77.0 ppm for CDCl3, 2.49 and 39.5 ppm for (CD3)2SO). Elemental
analysis was carried out on a Eurovector EA 3000 automated analyzer.
Electrochemical measurements were performed using an IPC 100 potentiostat,
with a platinum electrode (3.5 mm in diameter). A silver chloride
electrode was used as the reference electrode, and Bu4NBF4 was used as the supporting electrolyte. All measurements
were made in DMF. The potentials are recorded taking into account
iR compensation. The number of electrons was determined by comparing
the oxidation peaks of ferrocene obtained at equal concentrations.
HRMS spectra were measured on an Orbitrap Elite instrument using ESI.
A syringe injection was used for solutions in methanol/water (1:1;
10 μL/min flow rate). Nitrogen was applied as a dry gas. ATR–FTIR
spectra were obtained on an iS5 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
with ZnSe element (45°) (20 scans, resolution of 4 cm–1).

Potentiometric and Spectrophotometric Titration
Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (Aldrich), 70% HClO4 aqueous solution (Aldrich), KNO3, NaClO4·H2O, and NaOH were of analytical grade and were
used as received, without further purification.

In all of the
experiments, deionized water (18.2 MΩ) was used. The Cu(ClO4)2 solution was standardized by titration with
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, using xylenol orange as an indicator,
as described in detail earlier.76 The 0.1
M NaOH solution was standardized potentiometrically with oxalic acid,
which was used as a primary standard. The 0.1 M HClO4 solution
was prepared by dilution of the 70% aqueous solution and was standardized
by titration with NaOH. Stock solutions of 0.01 M ligand (L), 1 M
KNO3, and 1 M NaClO4 were prepared by dissolution
of weighed amounts of these compounds in volumetric flasks.

For potentiometric titration, autotitrator 848 Titrino plus, equipped
with a 20 mL autoburette and a Metrohm combined glass electrode (model
60262100), was used. A constant temperature of 25.0 ± 0.1 °C
was maintained in the cell using a thermostat. A combined glass electrode
was calibrated by titration of a preliminarily standardized solution
of HClO4 with a NaOH solution of known concentration and
calculation of the equivalent point using Gans’ method.77 The latter allowed us to define the standard
electrode potential, E0, and the slope
of the electrode function. The ionic product of water in 0.1 M KNO3/NaClO4 was obtained, pKw = 13.78. For determination of the ligand’s protonation constants,
potentiometric titration of a 20 mL solution containing 8–10
× 10–4 M ligand, 5–6 × 10–3 M HClO4, and 0.1 M KNO3/NaClO4 was
carried out in a glass cell in a water-jacketed thermostated vessel
using 9.5–11 × 10–2 M NaOH as the titrant.
Titration was performed over a pH range of 2.5–10.5. The electrode’s
electromotive force values were measured after the addition of 0.03
mL increments of standard NaOH solution. After each addition of titrant,
equilibrium was considered to have been established if the variation
in the potential was <0.2 mV/min. The protonation constants of
the ligands and the complexation constants were calculated using Hyperquad
software.78 At least two replicates of
the titration procedure per L and Cu2+ + L were performed.

For spectrophotometric titration, titrate solutions of 8 ×
10–3 M ligand were prepared at pH 5.0 ± 0.1.
Absorption spectra were recorded in the wavelength range 400–1000
nm (Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer) after the addition of 0.01
mL increments of standard Cu(ClO4)2 solution
with a Hamilton microsyringe (V = 0.05 mL) and adjusting
the pH to 5.0 ± 0.1.
