High-energy-density rechargeable
batteries with performance beyond
that of lithium-ion batteries are required for next-generation electric
vehicles. We propose a novel rechargeable battery with a lithium anode
and a NiCl2 aqueous cathode that is separated Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 as a water-stable lithium-ion-conducting solid electrolyte.
The cell was discharged up to 93% of the theoretical cathode capacity
at 0.5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C. The calculated energy
density, based on the weights of NiCl2 and Li, and the
average discharge voltage of 2.4 V at 0.5 mA cm–2, was 852 Wh kg–1, which is more than twice as
high as that of conventional lithium-ion batteries. The cell was successfully
cycled for 50 cycles without any degradation of the charge and discharge
voltages at 0.5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C for 5 h charge
and 5 h discharge, where the utilization of NiCl2 was 80%.

1 Introduction
Recently,
the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has increased
significantly with an aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to
exploit the higher total energy conversion efficiency of batteries
than that of internal combustion (IC) engines.1 Commercialized EVs with the current lithium-ion batteries have considerably
lower driving ranges than vehicles with IC engines, and the charging
time for these batteries is excessive when compared to that to fill
a gasoline tank. These serious problems should be solved to realize
the dissemination of EVs. The specific energy density of a gasoline
IC engine for automotive applications is estimated to be around 1700
Wh kg–1,2 whereas the
theoretical specific energy density for a lithium-ion battery based
on a carbon anode and a LiCoO2-based cathode is as low
as 387 Wh kg–1.3 The
lithium-ion diffusion constants in Li0.65CoO24 and graphite5 are reported to be 9.8 × 10–8 and 10–8–10–6 cm2 s–1 at 25 °C, respectively, which are several orders
lower than that for aqueous liquid electrolytes.6 Therefore, the specific power density of a high-capacity
lithium-ion battery is less than 1000 W kg–1.7

In this decade, lithium–sulfur8 and lithium–air9 batteries have
been extensively studied as high-energy-density batteries for EVs.
The theoretical energy densities of these batteries are 2567 and 3050
Wh kg–1, respectively, which are higher than that
of the IC engine. However, even after a decade of research and development,
mass production of these batteries has yet to be realized. Several
problems with respect to the cell chemistry must be addressed.10−15

Aqueous lithium batteries are attractive candidate for high-energy
and power-density applications.16,17 Two types of aqueous
lithium batteries have been proposed; one with an aqueous electrolyte
and lithium interaction electrodes developed by Dahn and co-workers,18,19 and the other with an aqueous cathode and lithium anode separated
by a water-stable lithium-conducting solid electrolyte developed by
Goodenough and co-workers.20−25 The former aqueous lithium battery system exhibits high power density;
however, the specific energy density is lower than that of conventional
lithium-ion batteries. The cell proposed by Goodenough and co-workers20 consists of a water-stable Li1+xAlxTi2–x(PO4)3 (LATP) separator, a
water soluble redox couple cathode, Fe(CN)63–/Fe(CN)64–, and a lithium anode. This
cell has a theoretical specific energy density of 392 Wh kg–1, which is comparable to that of current lithium-ion batteries. Byon
and co-workers23 proposed a similar aqueous
lithium battery with a triiodide/iodide redox couple in an aqueous
cathode that exhibited excellent rate capability, although the theoretical
specific energy density was comparable to that of lithium-ion batteries.
The cell with Ni(OH)220 and
Br225 exhibited a theoretical
energy density that was twice as high as that of conventional lithium-ion
batteries; however, the stability of the lithium-conducting solid
electrolyte in aqueous electrolytes is questionable. Lithium metal
anodes with liquid cathodes are attractive for the development of
high specific power and energy density rechargeable batteries. We
have recently reported on high specific energy density aqueous lithium
rechargeable batteries with a metal chloride MCl2 (M =
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) aqueous cathode that have proven to be feasible.26 Among these cathodes, the Li/CoCl2 and Li/NiCl2 couples exhibit successful charge and discharge
performance; the estimated specific energy density of the Li/NiCl2 couple, determined from the mass of the cell components with
a Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 (LAGTP; 0.1 mm thick) separator, was
670 Wh kg–1 (except the packaging). The charge and
discharge performance of the Li/NiCl2 cell at a high discharge
depth is investigated here to confirm the high specific energy density
of this system.

2 Results and Discussion
The Li/NiCl2 cell was composed of a lithium metal anode,
a Li(FSO2)2N (LiFSI)-tetraethylene glycol dimethyl
ether (G4) (1:2 molar ratio)-50 vol % 1,3 dioxolane (DOL) interlayer,
LAGTP-3 wt % epoxy resin film, a mixture of saturated NiCl2 and LiCl aqueous solutions (1:1 v/v), and a Ni metal current collector.
LAGTP was reported to be unstable in contact with lithium metal;27 therefore, (LiFSI-2G4)-50 vol % DOL was used
as the interlayer between the lithium metal anode and LAGTP to prevent
direct contact. The (LiFSI-2G4)-50 vol % DOL electrolyte suppresses
the formation of lithium dendrites during the lithium deposition process
at room temperature and high current density.28

The stability of the lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte
in
the catholyte is necessary. LATP was reported to be stable in aqueous
acetic acid saturated with lithium acetate, the pH of which was 3.34.29 The stability of LAGTP–epoxy in a saturated
aqueous solution of both NiCl2 and LiCl was examined. The
impedance profiles of the Pt/NiCl2–LiCl/LAGTP–epoxy
film/NiCl2–LiCl/Pt cell over time at 25 °C
are shown in Figure 1a. The pH value of the NiCl2–LiCl solution was
3.7. No change of the impedance profiles was observed for three weeks.
The impedance profiles showed a semicircle, which indicates the grain
boundary resistance.30 The total (bulk
and grain boundary) and grain boundary conductivities of the LAGTP–epoxy
film were 7.0 × 10–4 and 2.6 × 10–3 S cm–1 at 25 °C, which are
comparable with those reported previously.31 An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the LAGTP film kept in the
NiCl2–LiCl aqueous solution for one month was the
same as that of the pristine LAGTP, as shown in Figure 1b. The lattice parameters of LAGTP were slightly
decreased from 8.4755 to 8.4571 Å for the a lattice
and from 20.7347 to 20.7303 Å for the c lattice
after immersion in the aqueous solution for one month. Figure 1c shows a schematic diagram
of the pouch-type Li/(LiFSI-2G4)-50 vol % DOL/LAGTP–epoxy film/saturated
NiCl2 and LiCl aqueous solution (1:1 v/v)/Ni cell (Li/NiCl2 cell), where the thicknesses of the interlayer electrolyte,
LAGTP, and catholyte were 0.016, 0.335, and 0.146 mm, respectively.
The impedance profile of the Li/NiCl2 cell at 25 °C
is shown in Figure 1d. The semicircle in the high-frequency region corresponds to the
grain boundary resistance of the LAGTP–epoxy film, and the
semicircle in the low-frequency region corresponds to the solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI) on lithium.32 The total
cell resistance was ca. 200 Ω cm2. The highest contribution
to the cell resistance is the resistance of the SEI between lithium
and the interlayer electrolyte.

Figure 2a shows
a discharge curve for the Li/NiCl2 cell at 0.5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C. The open-circuit voltage of 2.82
V at 25 °C was in good agreement with that calculated from the
following cell reaction Anode:
  Cathode:
 An issue with the aqueous lithium cell is
the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction  The Ni2+ reduction potential in
the mixture of saturated NiCl2 and LiCl is higher than
that of the hydrogen reduction potential on Ni metal, including the
hydrogen overpotential.33 The discharge
curve shows two discharge plateaus, the first of which is attributed
to the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni.

cell at 0.5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C, (b) gas chromatogram
signal of the detected gas, and (c) change of the amount of evolved
hydrogen gas with discharge period.

Ni deposition was confirmed with the Li/NiCl2/carbon
cell (Figure S2). After approximately 9
h discharge, the cell voltage abruptly dropped from 2.4 to 1.7 V and
then plateau voltages were observed. The capacity of the first plateau
was 4.55 mAh, which corresponds to 93.6% reduction of Ni2+ to Ni in the catholyte. The second plateau is attributed to the
hydrogen evolution reaction. Hydrogen gas was detected using gas chromatography
with an in-house built sealed container with a pouch-type Li/NiCl2 cell (Figure S1). Hydrogen gas
was not observed in the first plateau range and the amount of hydrogen
was increased with the discharge period, as shown in Figure 2c. The amount of observed hydrogen
gas was slightly less than that calculated according to the electricity
passed through the cell.

The charge and discharge cycle performance
at 0.5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C is shown in Figure 3a for the Li/NiCl2 cell, where the cell
was discharged for 5 h, rested for 1 h, and charged for 5 h. The utilization
of NiCl2 in the catholyte was ca. 80%. This cell showed
excellent cyclic performance for 50 cycles. The specific energy density
of conventional lithium-ion batteries is generally dependent on the
area specific capacity.34,35 However, the Li/NiCl2 cell showed no dependence of the specific energy density
on the charged amount of NiCl2 in the catholyte. Figure 3b shows the capacity
vs charged amount of NiCl2 at 0.5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C. The observed capacities were almost the same as
those calculated for the reduction of Ni2+ in the catholyte.
This result suggests that the energy density of the practical battery
approaches the calculated energy density because the contribution
of the weight of the nonactive cell components decreases with an increase
in the cell capacity. EV batteries require high power density. Figure 3c shows the current
density vs cell voltage curves for the Li/NiCl2 cell at
25 °C, where the cell voltages were measured after 10 min discharge
(or charge). At low current density, Ni deposition and dissolution
polarization contribute mainly to the cell voltage drop, whereas at
high current density the cell voltage drop is predominantly due to
the cell resistance, as shown in Figure S3. The surface morphology of the Ni electrode after cycling showed
no dendrite formation (Figure S4).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
a novel high specific energy density aqueous lithium
rechargeable battery was developed that consists of a lithium metal
anode and an aqueous NiCl2 solution cathode separated by
a LAGTP–epoxy film. The cell exhibited excellent cycling performance
at 0.5 mA cm–2 and 25 °C. The specific capacity
showed no dependence on the mass of the active material. The specific
energy density for the cell with a high areal capacity of 100 mAh
cm–2 could be expected to be 643 Wh kg–1 based on the mass of lithium, the NiCl2·2H2O cathode, and the 0.2 mm thick LAGTP film with a discharge cell
voltage of 2.4 V, which is 1.7 times higher than the theoretical energy
density of the conventional lithium-ion cell.

4 Experimental
Section
Li1.4Al0.2Ge0.4Ti1.4(PO4)3 (LAGTP)–epoxy films
were prepared
according to the previously reported tape-casting method.31 LAGTP powders were prepared by the sol–gel
method using citric acid. Stoichiometric amounts of GeC8H20O4 and TiC18H36O4 (Aldrich) were dissolved in 0.2 M citric acid aqueous solution
at 90 °C overnight and then LiNO3, Al(NO)3, and NH4H2PO4 (Nakalai Tesque)
were added to the gel. After a homogenous solution was formed, ethylene
glycol was added and the solution was then heated at 200 °C to
allow water to evaporate. The gel was then heated at 580 °C for
4 h. The black-colored product was ground to a fine powder with an
agate mortar and pestle before sintering at 800 °C for 4 h. The
LAGTP powder was dispersed in a mixed solution of ethanol and toluene
with a fish oil dispersant for half a day using a high-speed mechanical
mill (Fritsch Planetary Micro Mill). Polybutylalcohol as a binder
and butyl benzyl phthalate as a plasticizer were added to the mixed
slurry, which was then ball-milled for another 10 h. The slurry was
deaired under vacuum. Tape-casting was performed on a silicon-coated
polyethylene substrate foil using double blades with gap heights of
0.7 and 0.4 mm and a constant casting speed of 60 cm min–1. After tape-casting, the green tape was slowly dried at 5 °C
for 24 h. Several green sheets were hot pressed together at 50 °C
and 50 Pa and then sintered at 900 °C for 7 h. The LAGTP–epoxy
composite films were prepared by dropping a mixed solution of 1 M
1,3 phenylenediamine and 2 M 2,2-bis(4-glycidyloxyphenyl)propane (0.5:1.0,
molar ratio) in tetrahydrofuran on the surface of the tape-cast LAGTP
film. The LAGTP films (0.4–0.2 mm thick) with the epoxy resin
solution were kept under vacuum for 30 h, and the films were dried
at 80 °C for 3 h and then polymerized at 170 °C overnight.
A pouch-type cell with a small amount of catholyte was used for cell
performance tests (see Figure 1c). The LAGTP–epoxy film was enveloped with a surface-modified
polypropylene film. The package was evacuated and heat-sealed, apart
from a 1.2 cm diameter window on the LAGTP–epoxy film. The
packed LAGTP film was sandwiched with a thin separator (Toray F16CK2,
0.016 mm in thickness) containing a (LiFSI-2G4)-50 vol % DOL interlayer
and lithium metal (0.2 mm thick, Honjyo Metal, Japan) and enveloped
with an aluminum-laminated film (2,4-dinitrophenol, Japan). These
procedures were performed in an Ar-charged glovebox. A thick separator
(nonwoven film, 0.17 mm thick) containing a saturated NiCl2 and LiCl aqueous solution (1:1, v/v) was attached to the Li/interlayer/LAGTP–epoxy
anode side. XRD data were obtained using a Rigaku RINT 2500 diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10 to 90°
at a scan step rate of 0.02° s–1. AC impedance
spectroscopy measurements of the cell were performed using a frequency
response analyzer (Solartron 1260) with an electrochemical interface
(Solartron S1 1287) in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The
cell potentials were measured using a potentio-galvanostat (Biologic
Science Instruments VMPX).
