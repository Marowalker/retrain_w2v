Different contents of fluorine in
side alkyl chains were incorporated
into three conjugated polymers (namely, PBDTTT-f13, PBDTTT-f9, and
PBDTTT-f5) whose backbones consist of benzodithiophene donors and
thienothiophene acceptors. These three fluorinated polymers, in comparison
with the well-known analogue PTB7-Th, show comparable energy levels
and optical band gaps. However, the fluorination of side alkyl chains
significantly changed the surface energy of bulk materials, which
leads to distinctly different self-assembly behaviors and phase separations
as being mixed with PC71BM. The increased mismatch in surface
energies between the polymer and PC71BM causes larger scale
phase domains, which makes a sound explanation for the difference
in their photovoltaic properties.

Introduction
A significant progress
in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar
cells (PSCs) has been achieved through developments in both novel
molecular design and optimized device architectures.1−4 As a result, the performance of BHJ-PSCs has exceeded 11% in power
conversion efficiency (PCE).5,6 In most of the cases,
the active layer of BHJ-PSCs is a blend of electron-rich polymers
as a donor and electron-deficient fullerene derivatives as an acceptor
to form an interpenetrating nanoscopic network. For typical conjugated
polymers, the exciton diffusion length is rather short, usually on
the order of tens of nanometers. If the phase domains are bigger than
the diffusion length, the recombination possibility of excitons will
dramatically increase.7,8 Therefore, a well-defined phase
separation with appropriate domain size is critical to efficient charge
dissociation and also centrally important for providing the continuous
percolation pathway for smooth charge transport with minimized charge
losses.

To optimize the phase separation of a photoactive layer,
many efforts
have been focused on manipulating device-processing conditions, including
blend ratio,9,10 thermal/solvent annealing,11−13 and introduction of additives.14,15 Beyond the
conditional control, the nature of the materials determined by their
molecular structures is more decisive to the phase segregation of
BHJ blend films.16,17 In this regard, a compromise
is often made between the polymer donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PCBM) acceptors. That is, a good phase separation
demands a difference between their surface energies, that is, an immiscible
nature, whereas a great difference is not favorable for the formation
of uniform phase separation.18,19 In this regard, surface
energy was first introduced to explain the phase separation phenomenon
by Kim et al. in 2010.20 They found that
the terminal groups of the P3HT polymer have great influence on the
surface energy, similar to the surface morphology of P3HT/PCBM blend
films. Following this strategy, Sun et al.21 were able to tune the surface morphology of BHJ thin films by controlling
the content of cyanohexane side chains in conjugated polymers. They
all observed that highly miscible blends with nanoscale phase separation
could be achieved when two components of an active layer had a similar
surface energy, whereas polymers with large surface energy differences
to PCBM tend to result in a large domain size and a significant phase
separation.

In recent years, fluorinated conjugated materials
have been widely
used in organic photovoltaics.22 Fluorine
atoms, because of their strong electron-withdrawing effect, would
lower both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level.23−26 In addition, this modification is in favor of higher photoelectron
conversion as being applied in BHJ-PSCs.27−30 Compared with the nonfluorinated
counterparts, fluorinated polymers exhibit a series of unique features
such as high thermal stability, enhanced chemical resistance, and
low surface energy.31 Given the phase separation
of the blend films, whether the lowered surface energy is a positive
or negative factor calls for an answer. According to our knowledge,
there is no precedent work that systematically investigates the role
of a fluorinated side alkyl chain acting in surface energy as well
as the phase separation in BHJ blend films.

Herein, a series
of conjugated polymers based on alternating benzodithiophene
(BDT) units as an electron donor and thienothiophene (TT) units as
an electron acceptor were synthesized, named PBDTTT-fx (x = 13, 9, 5) series polymers, where x stands for the number of fluorine atoms in the side chain of TT
unit. The molecular structures of these polymers are presented in Scheme 1. The energy levels
and photoabsorption abilities of fluorinated polymers are similar
to those of their known counterpart PTB7-Th.32 As being applied as donors in BHJ-PSCs, quite different device performances
were obtained. The surface morphology analysis indicates that a well-defined
phase separation of the BHJ blend film corresponds to higher device
performance. The phase separation, we believe, should be correlated
with the surface energy of individual polymers that are deduced from
the results of a group of contact angle measurements. The surface
energies of PBDTTT-f13, PBDTTT-f9, PBDTTT-f5, and PTB7-Th are 19.6,
22.3, 25.8, and 32.0 mJ/m2, respectively. As for the acceptor
material, PC71BM owns a surface energy of 31.0 mJ/m2. A high-quality phase separation and a high device performance
were achieved as PTB7-Th:PC71BM pair was applied as the
photoactive materials. This work gives us a hint that the surface
energy of the targeting materials should be taken into account as
designing new polymer donors.

of PBDTTT-f13, PBDTTT-f9,
and PBDTTT-f5
Results and Discussion
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra of PBDTTT-fx-based polymers in chloroform and in the film state are
shown in Figure 1.
The absorption peaks of PBDTTT-f13, PBDTTT-f9, and PTB7-Th are similar,
whereas the absorption peak of PBDTTT-f5 shows a blue shift compared
with those of others. The former three polymers exhibited an intense
absorption from 500 to 800 nm with two peaks at around 650 and 700
nm, which can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer and
interchain interaction, respectively.33,34 To understand
the blue shift of PBDTTT-f5, polymer solutions were heated from 30
to 100 °C. As shown in Figure 2, the absorption spectra indicate a temperature-dependent
feature. For all polymers, the peak at around 700 nm decreased with
the increase in temperature and shifted to short wavelength. An extreme
case is that the corresponding peak of PBDTTT-f5 almost disappeared
as the temperature was elevated to 100 °C. Knowing the fact that
the peak at around 700 nm corresponds to the interchain interactions
of the polymers, it can be concluded that the intermolecular interaction
between PBDTTT-f5 should be less stronger than the rest of the polymers.

PBDTTT-f5
(c), and PTB7-Th (d) in chlorobenzene solution as being heated from
30 to 100 °C with a temperature interval of 10 °C.

The LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) of PBDTTT-f13,
PBDTTT-f9, PBDTTT-f5, and PTB7-Th were determined by cyclic voltammetry
(CV), as shown in Figure 3. The onset reduction potentials (Ered) of PBDTTT-f13, PBDTTT-f9, PBDTTT-f5, and PTB7-Th were 1.31, 1.32,
1.34, and 1.39 V, respectively. ELUMO of
these polymers can be calculated using the equation ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.80)
(eV). Therefore, the ELUMO values of PBDTTT-f13,
PBDTTT-f9, PBDTTT-f5, and PTB7-Th are −3.49, −3.48,
−3.46, and −3.41 eV, respectively. The HOMO energy levels
(EHOMO) can be calculated according to
the equation EHOMO = ELUMO + Eg,opt. All band gaps
and energy levels are summarized in Table 1. The PBDTTT-fx series polymers
show comparable energy levels with those of PTB7-Th, indicating that
fluorination of the side chain has little effect on the energy levels
of the polymers.

The surface morphologies of
the as spin-coated films were observed
using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Figure 4. The PBDTTT-fx series polymers, except for PBDTTT-f5, showed surface topologies
similar to those of PTB7-Th. Interdigitated fibrous nanostructures
with a width of around 10 nm were observed in all polymer films. Because
the number of fluorine atoms is small, for example, PBDTTT-f5, the
relatively ordered self-assembled nanostructures are formed in comparison
with PTB7-Th. These results are consistent with the conclusion drawn
by Cho et al.35 that the interactions of
fluorine can strengthen the interactions between the side alkyl chains.
Further increasing the fluorine atoms should enhance this effect.
Therefore, for PBDTTT-f13 and PBDTTT-f9, interdigitated fibrous nanostructures
were observed in the films as well.

To investigate the miscibility of PBDTTT-fx series
polymers and PC71BM in blend films, AFM investigation on
PBDTTT-fx:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films was performed. In Figure 4, all polymers revealed similar surface profiles.
However, drastic differences between the surface morphologies of the
blends were observed, as shown in Figure 5. In Figure 5a, the PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM blend shows the
formation of large, isolated aggregates, and the domain sizes are
more than hundreds of nanometers. This morphology is probably due
to the low entropy of mixing between the polymer and PC71BM because immiscible materials tend to phase-segregate into large
domains during the spin-coating process. Considering the relatively
short diffusion length of excitons, which is usually less than 10
nm, these overlarge phase domains are disadvantageous for efficient
exciton dissociation in the BHJ films. With a lower content of fluorine
atoms, as shown in Figure 5b, the spherical domains did not exist in the morphology of
the PBDTTT-f9:PC71BM blend, whereas some distinct aggregates
still exist. On the other hand, the blend films of PBDTTT-f5:PC71BM show a favorable interpenetrating network in Figure 5c, which are similar
to the morphology of PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends shown in Figure 5d. Besides, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films show smoother surface [with a root-mean-square
(rms) roughness of 1.4 nm] than PBDTTT-fx:PC71BM blend films (the rms roughness values of PBDTTT-f5:PC71BM, PBDTTT-f9:PC71BM, and PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM blends were 1.7, 2.1, and 3.3 nm, respectively). This well-tuned
morphology is beneficial to efficient exciton dissociation and charge
transportation. Because immiscibility in a donor/acceptor blend arises
from the large surface energy difference between the donor and acceptor
materials,36 the homogeneous network of
the PBDTTT-f5:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends
can be ascribed to the well-matched surface energies between the donor
and the acceptor. For Figure 5i–l, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
accord with the AFM results.

and TEM (bottom row)
images of blend films prepared by the spin coating of PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM (a,e,i), PBDTTT-f9:PC71BM (b,f,j), PBDTTT-f5:PC71BM (c,g,k), and PTB7-Th:PC71BM (d,h,l). The blend
ratios of polymer:PC71BM were 1:1.5 for PBDTTT-fx and PTB7-Th.

The measurement of surface energy was recorded to clarify
the reason
for the formation of different morphologies of blend films. The contact
angles of the PBDTTT-fx series polymers, PTB7-Th,
and PC71BM were measured using liquid drops of water (θwater) and monoethylene glycol (MEG) (θMEG), as shown in Table 2. The surface energies (γSV) were calculated by
the following equation.    where θ is the contact angle of a liquid
drop on the surface of the samples and γLV, γLVd, and γLVp correspond to
the surface energy of water and MEG, dispersive component, and polar
component of the surface energy of water and MEG, respectively.

Table 2 Pictures of Water Contact Angle (θwater) and Ethylene Glycol Contact Angle (θMEG) on the
Films of PBDTTT-fx, PTB7-Th, and PC71BM
The surface energies of
PBDTTT-fx, PTB7-Th, and
PC71BM are summarized in Table 3. The increase of fluorine atoms in the BDT
side chain led to a lowered surface energy value, 19.6, 22.3, 25.8,
and 32.0 mJ/m2 for PBDTTT-f13, PBDTTT-f9, PBDTTT-f5, and
PTB7-Th, respectively. The surface energy of PC71BM was
also measured to be 31.0 mJ/m2, which is close to that
of PTB7-Th. The surface energy differences between donor polymers
and the PC71BM acceptor (ΔγSV) decreased
consistently from PBDTTT-f13 to PTB7-Th; as a result, an uniform BHJ
blend was obtained from the PTB7-Th:PC71BM mixture because
of the well-matched surface energies between PTB7-Th and PC71BM. On the basis of the AFM and contact angle results, therefore,
better performance is expected from the BHJ solar cells fabricated
with a PTB7-Th:PC71BM film as the active layer.

The photovoltaic properties of these polymers were
investigated
in PSCs with a conventional device configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (∼40
nm)/polymer:PC71BM/Ca (∼20 nm)/Al (∼80 nm).
The performance of the PSCs was investigated by recording the respective
current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves,
as shown in Figure 6. Detailed parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are summarized in Table 4. The Jsc values were all consistent with the integrated photocurrents
[Jsc(EQE)] determined by the EQE spectra
in Figure 6b. The photovoltaic
device based on the PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM showed the lowest
PCE of only 1.98%, with Voc of 0.77 V, Jsc of 5.00 mA/cm2, and FF of 51.2%.
The poor device performance of PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM can be
attributed to the large-scale heterogeneities where the domain sizes
are too large to achieve efficient exciton dissociation. However,
the PTB7-Th:PC71BM device yields the highest PCE of 7.56%,
which is almost 4 times enhanced than that of the PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM solar cell, with an increased Jsc of 14.14 mA/cm2 and FF of 68.3%. The result of a significantly
enhanced Jsc value showed that the favorable
interpenetrating morphology facilitates more efficient charge dissociation
and transport in the active layer, which leads to a higher device
performance.

PTB7-Th	0.77	14.41	68.3	7.56	14.02	
The PBDTTT-f9:PC71BM device
showed a slightly increased
PCE of 2.47% as compared with PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM, and the
BHJ device based on PBDTTT-f5 showed a moderately increased PCE of
5.93%. The upward trend in PCE from PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM to
PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices can be correlated with the well-tuned
morphology of the active layer and the well-matched surface energies
between donor polymers and the fullerene acceptor.

To gain an
insight understanding of the tendency of PCEs, the charge
extraction properties were studied by plotting the photocurrent density
(Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the solar cells. Jph can be determined by the equation Jph = JL – JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and
in the dark, respectively. Veff can be
determined by the equation Veff = V0 – V, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and V is the corresponding applied voltage.
As shown in Figure 7, Jph of each device reaches saturation
(where the corresponding current density is defined as Jsat) at high Veff value, suggesting
that all charge carriers generated in the photoactive layers are extracted
by the electrodes. Jph under the maximum
power point (where the corresponding current density is defined as Jmp) of each device is calculated from the J–V curves. Jsat, Jmp, and the ratio of Jmp/Jsat are summarized
in Table 5. The ratio
of Jmp/Jsat for the PSC based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM was 66%, indicating
that more than half of the photogenerated carriers were collected
by the electrodes at the maximum power point. The efficient charge
collection might be resulted from the well-tuned morphology of the
blend films. By contrast, the ratio of Jmp/Jsat decreased to 63, 40, and 38% when
PTB7-Th was replaced by PBDTTT-f13, PBDTTT-f9, and PBDTTT-f5, respectively.
These results further confirm that a good phase separation should
be responsible for the efficient extraction from the active layer
to the electrodes.

PBDTTT-f5	12.88	8.06	63	
PTB7-Th	17.17	11.36	66	
The charge
transport property in the photoactive layers was also
investigated using the space-charge-limited current equation to calculate
the carrier mobilities. The corresponding J–V curves (Figures S1 and S2)
and detailed data (Tables S1 and S2) are
presented in the Supporting Information. For the pristine polymer films, the hole mobilities of the polymers
increased with the number of F atoms in the side alkyl chains. These
results indicate that increasing F contents in the side alkyl chains
can improve the charge transport properties of PBDTTT-fx polymers. However, for the blend films, the hole mobilities showed
a reverse trend; that is, they decreased with the number of F atoms
in the side alkyl chains, and the electron mobilities also showed
a downward trend when increasing the number of F atoms. These results
suggest that the charge transportation inside of the active layers
will be hindered with an increase in the number of F atoms because
of the excessive phase separation in the blend films.

In addition
to J–V and Jph–Veff characteristics,
the alternating current impedance spectrometry (ACIS) of the devices
was measured. Figure 8a–d shows the Nyquist plots of the solar cell based on PBDTTT-fx polymers and PTB7-Th blend with PC71BM at the
corresponding Voc bias voltages in the
dark. The complete device can be modeled as the three different regions
for carrier relaxation. From high to low (i.e., left to right) frequency,
the impedance responses correspond to the active layer (R1 and C1), the buffer layer
region (R2 and C2), and the interface between the buffer layer and the active
layer (R3 and C3). The equivalent circuit shown in Figure 8e was employed to fit the Nyquist plots.
The parameters fitted from the ACIS are listed in Table 6. The equivalent circuit is
represented as the combination of parallel resistance–capacitance
circuits in series. Rs is regarded as
the contribution of the series resistance between the two electrodes
and the external circuit, which reflects the properties of the conductive
electrode and is not addressed in the rest of the discussion. Generally,
smaller resistances facilitate the transfer of charge carriers, thus
leading to better performance.

PTB7-Th	51.8	32.6	14.5	57.1	27.4	172.4	5.7	
For the PSCs using
PBDTTT-f13 as a donor, R1 shows the largest
value among PBDTTT-fx and
PTB7-Th polymers. Owing to the decrease in the amount of fluorine
atoms in the alkyl side chain, the value of R1 shows a downward trend from PBDTTT-f13 to PTB7-Th, indicating
more efficient exciton transport arising from the formation of an
interpenetrating network in the BHJ layer, and this result is in accordance
with the AFM image. The downward trend of R2 and R3 from PBDTTT-f13:PC71BM to PTB7-Th:PC71BM device also indicates the influence
of surface morphology on the device performance.

Conclusions
In
summary, a series of donor-/acceptor-conjugated polymers bearing
different alkyl chains with varying fluorine contents were designed
and synthesized. Their surface energies were systematically investigated
and applied as a metric for the interpretation of phase separation
of the blend films of polymer and PC71BM. Taking the surface
energy of PC71BM (31.0 mJ/m2) as a reference,
the differences between the polymer and PC71BM are increasing
with the fluorine content in the alkyl chains, and consequently, the
phase domains of the corresponding films also increased. These variation
tendencies make a sound explanation to the device performances when
these polymers are applied as donors in PSCs. For PBDTTT-f5 and PTB7-Th
whose surface energies were close to that of PC71BM, their
blend films showed clear phase boundaries and smaller phase domains
of ∼40 nm, and the corresponding PSCs achieved higher PCEs
in the form of better Jsc and FF. Phase
separation of BHJ blend films is one of the most important issues
that can greatly affect the device performances. The present research
demonstrated that surface energy is one of the key factors that should
be taken into account as designing new conjugated polymers for highly
efficient PSCs.

from a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (SAN-Electric Co., Ltd.) with
an irradiation intensity of 100 mW/cm2. The EQE was measured
using QE-R3011 from Enli Technology Co., Ltd. The AFM images were
obtained using a Multimode 8 microscope (Bruker, Santa Barbara, USA).
The ACIS measurements were recorded with an ac signal with an rms
amplitude of 10 mV over the frequency range of 1 Hz–1 MHz in
the dark on an IM6 electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM, Germany).
The TEM images were obtained using a Hitachi HT7700 microscope (Japan)
operated at 120 kV.

Fabrication of Polymer
Solar Cells
The ITO substrates
were cleaned by a sequential ultrasonic procedure in an aqueous solution
of detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol. The cleaned
ITO substrates were dried at 150 °C to remove the trace amount
of solvent.

The configuration of PSCs was ITO/PEDOT:PSS (∼40
nm)/polymer:PC71BM/Ca (∼20 nm)/Al (∼80 nm).
The cleaned ITO substrates were treated with UV–ozone. PEDOT:PSS
was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated onto the
ITO surface. Subsequently, the ITO substrates with PEDOT:PSS films
were moved into an oven at 150 °C for 15 min. The blend solution
with 10 mg of polymer and 15 mg of PC71BM in 1 mL of o-DCB was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS film as a photoactive
layer. On top of the photoactive layer, 20 nm of Ca and 80 nm of Al
were thermally evaporated under vacuum of 1.0 × 10–5 Pa with a shadow mask covered on the surface to define the active
area to be 0.04 cm2. All of these operations except for
the preparation of PEDOT:PSS films were conducted in a nitrogen-filled
glovebox.
