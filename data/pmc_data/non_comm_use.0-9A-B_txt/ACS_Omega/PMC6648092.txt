In
this study, stable hybrid materials (Mt–Fe(III)Phen),
made by the μ-oxo Fe(III)–phenanthroline complex [(OH2)3(Phen)FeOFe(Phen)(OH2)3]4+ (Fe(III)Phen) intercalated in different amounts into
montmorillonite (Mt), were used as a trap for immobilizing gaseous
benzene and naphthalene and their mono chloro-derivatives at 25 and
50 °C. The entrapping process was studied through elemental analysis,
magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and evolved
gas mass spectrometry. Naphthalene and 1-chloronaphthalene were found
to be immobilized in large amount at both temperatures. Molecular
modeling allowed designing of the structure of the interlayer in the
presence of the immobilized aromatic molecules. Adsorption is affected
by the amount of the Fe complex hosted in the interlayer of the entrapping
hybrid materials. On the contrary, under the same conditions, benzene
and chlorobenzene were not adsorbed. Thermal desorption of naphthalenes
was obtained under mild conditions, and immobilization was found to
be reversible at least for 20 adsorption/desorption cycles.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Monocyclic
and polycyclic aromatic molecules are produced by several
industrial and human activities, including the combustion processes
of vehicles. Many efforts have been devoted to the production of materials
able to remove the pollutants through immobilization processes or
catalytic degradation. Several are presently available, but most lack
selectivity. In addition, they are successfully operated mainly in
solution. Only a few materials, such as zeolite HZSM-51 and diatomite-based ceramic monoliths coated with silicalite-1,2 trap effectively aromatic molecules in the gas
phase, and a number of challenges related to selectivity are to be
tackled, which are complicated by the low partial pressure of these
compounds in the flue gas. Natural and engineered zeolites are extensively
employed as catalysts in a variety of reactions involving benzene
and naphthalene. For example, zeolites are commercial catalysts currently
utilized in refineries to remove benzene from gasoline by alkylation
with olefins (BenzOUT process3). Other
reactions of benzene are catalyzed by zeolites, such as self-alkylation
and hydrogenation,4 oxidation to obtain
phenol,5 and hydrogenation to produce cyclohexane.6 Immobilization followed by a catalytic reaction
implies that the target aromatic species is transformed into different
final molecules and the overall process is irreversible, thus desorption
does not restore the starting species. Simple adsorption, instead,
allows the aromatic molecule to retain its structure and the recovery
of the chemical compound. For example, activated carbon is largely
employed as an industrial adsorbent for gases because of its effectiveness
and low cost.7 However, this material shows
many drawbacks as the limited thermal stability and poor versatility.
More importantly, the adsorbed organic gas molecules are confined
in the slitlike micropores, and this could result in a difficult desorption
and regeneration.2 Moreover, in some cases,
immobilization partly occurs via chemical adsorption, which changes
the functional groups and the structure of activated carbon. For example,
Guo et al.8 found that after chlorobenzene
adsorption, the lactone and quinone groups on activated carbon decreased,
and the structure of activated carbon slightly changed. In addition,
activated carbon, also after specific treatments, is poorly selective.

Here, we have investigated the effectiveness of a hybrid material
made by the intercalation of the μ-oxo di-fac-[triaqua-(1,10-phenanthroline-k2N,N′)-iron(III)]4+, [(OH2)3(Phen)FeOFe(Phen)(OH2)3]4+ complex (Fe(III)Phen),9 onto montmorillonite (Mt–Fe(III)Phen hereafter) to immobilize
some selected paradigmatic aromatic molecules from the gas phase:
benzene, chlorobenzene, naphthalene, and 1-chloronaphthalene. In previous papers, this
hybrid material (Mt–Fe(III)Phen) was characterized, unraveling
that the Fe(III)Phen complex has a structuring effect on the interlayer
because of the presence and orientation of extended aromatic regions
of the ligand;10,11 then this hybrid material was
proved effective in trapping volatile sulfur compounds, aliphatic
thiols and H2S.12,13 In this case, the entrapping
mechanism for thiols and H2S is controlled by the redox
and coordination properties of the metal center. In the present work,
on the other hand, we investigated the ability of the interlayer structured
by the Fe(III)Phen complex, which bears two coordinated planar phenanthroline
ligands almost parallel to each other,9 to capture specific aromatic compounds, thanks to the polycyclic
nature of the Phen ligand.

Here, benzene, chlorobenzene, naphthalene,
and 1-chloronaphthalene
trapping by Mt–Fe(III)Phen was studied to understand if a relationship
exists between the entrapping efficiency and the size of the aromatic
moiety and to test the effect of a halogen substitution. Removal of
such pollutants from the environment would be a result of great social
and industrial significance.14

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Mt STx-1a
from the Clay
Minerals Society (The Clay Minerals Society, Source Clays Repository,
University of Missouri, Columbia, MO) was characterized elsewhere.15,16 It was used “as received”, avoiding any purification
or exchange process intended to obtain a homogeneous counterion, as
efficiency of this clay mineral in the adsorption of the Fe(III)Phen
complex was already proved when used “as it is”.10,12,13

All the chemicals used
for preparation of the adsorbent material were of analytical grade
(purity > 99%) and purchased from Carlo Erba (Fe2(SO4)3·8H2O and NaOH pellets) or from
Sigma-Aldrich (1,10-phenanthroline C12H8N2, Phen). The aromatic molecules tested for adsorption in the
gas phase were as follows: benzene 99.0% (AnalaR, analytical reagent, benz hereafter), chlorobenzene ≥ 99.5% (Fluka, Clbenz hereafter), naphthalene scintillation grade (BDH Laboratory
reagents, naph hereafter), and 1-chloronaphthalene 90%
(Aldrich Chemie, Clnaph hereafter).

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Preparation of Mt Intercalated
with Different
Amounts of the Fe(III)Phen Complex: Mt–Fe(III)Phen Materials
The solutions of [(OH2)3(Phen)FeOFe(Phen)(OH2)3]4+(Fe(III)Phen) were prepared by
dissolving Fe2(SO4)3·8H2O in aqueous Phen solutions (typically 2 ÷ 12 mM) in
order to have a 1:1 Fe(III)/Phen molar ratio.10 The Fe(III)Phen solutions (20 mL) in the 1–6 mM range of
concentration were mixed with 100 mg of Mt to form the corresponding
suspensions. The suspensions were shaken at 250 rpm in an orbital
incubator (Stuart Scientific Orbital Incubator SI50) at 20 °C
for 30 min using a Haake k20 thermocryostat and then kept in the thermostated
incubator. After the solid–liquid separation, the supernatant
was removed with a pipette. The solids were washed several times with
distilled water and dried at 30 °C. They have different levels
of interlayer saturation by the filling of complex molecules, and
all constitute the Mt–Fe(III)Phen adsorbent materials. Quantification
of the amount of the intercalated complex was obtained by UV–vis
measurements (JASCO V-570 Spectrophotometer) performed on the different
supernatants, previously centrifuged at 14 000 rpm (Thermo
mod. Espresso) for 1 min to remove residual clay traces. qcomplex is defined as the content in the iron complex
of the Mt–Fe(III)Phen material, expressed as moles of Fe(III)Phen
per 100 g of Mt–Fe(III)Phen; qcomplex ranges from 0.005 to 0.038 (saturation limit of Mt) moles of Fe(III)Phen/100
g Mt–Fe(III)Phen.10,12,13

2.2.2 Immobilization of Aromatic Compounds in
the Gas Phase on Mt–Fe(III)Phen at Different qcomplex Values
Mt–Fe(III)Phen prepared
with qcomplex ranging from 0.005 to 0.038
moles of Fe(III)Phen/100 g Mt–Fe(III)Phen was exposed to the
vapors of aromatic compounds benz, Clbenz, naph, and Clnaph at 25
and 50 °C for 1 month. The Mt–Fe(III)Phen adsorbent material
(100 mg) was finely dispersed in a glass Petri dish (diameter 5 cm)
and placed in a sealed glass box in the dark. The aromatic compound
(benz, Clbenz, naph, and Clnaph) was placed in a beaker inside the
same glass box, which was closed with a sealing cap. The glass boxes
were thermostated at 25 and 50 °C for 1 month. In this way, we
can confidently assume that at each temperature, the box was always
saturated with the vapor of the aromatic compound at the vapor pressure
(ref (17), Table S1, page S2). After 1 month, the elemental
analyses were performed on samples to find the maximum amount of the
adsorbed aromatic compounds. Hereafter, these materials after exposure
to benz, Clbenz, naph, and Clnaph at 25 and 50 °C will be indicated
as Mt–Fe(III)Phen–benz25, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–benz50, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clbenz25, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clbenz50, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naph25, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naph50, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaph25, and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaph50. In addition, for the material prepared
with the amount of the complex which gives the maximum adsorption
capacity, the “best” suffix was introduced: Mt–Fe(III)Phen–benzbest25, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–benzbest50, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clbenzbest25, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clbenzbest50, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest50, Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25, and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest50.

2.2.3 Kinetics
of Immobilization of the Aromatic
Compounds in the Gas Phase
Kinetics of immobilization was
investigated on Mt–Fe(III)Phen showing the maximum immobilization
capacity of naph and Clnaph at 25 and 50 °C, respectively (qcomplex = 0.022 and 0.025 moles of Fe(III)Phen
in 100 g of Mt–Fe(III)Phen), which will be indicated as Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50. Batches
of Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50 samples were prepared and exposed to the vapors of naph
and Clnaph at 25 and 50 °C, respectively, as a function of time
in the range 1 h to 30 days, using the same procedure described in
the previous paragraph. The elemental analyses performed on samples
at different times allowed to investigate the kinetics of immobilization
of the aromatic compounds.

2.2.4 Desorption of Aromatic
Compounds from Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and
Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25 at Different
Temperature Values; Adsorption/Desorption Cycles
Batches
of Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and
Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25 were treated
at different temperature values: 160, 180, and 200 °C for t = 10 min; elemental analysis was performed on the samples
after every minute of treatment to measure the residual amount of
aromatic compounds as a function of time. Samples were completely
desorbed at T = 200 °C, and then they underwent
20 adsorption/desorption cycles (adsorption at 25 °C for 400
h and desorption at 200 °C); the content in the aromatic compound
was checked during the 20 cycles at different times by elemental analysis.

2.2.5 Elemental Analysis
The elemental
analyses (C, N, S) of the samples before and after exposure to the
vapors of aromatic compounds were performed by a Carlo Erba elemental
analyzer (model 1106) and used to calculate the amount of the adsorbed
aromatic compound.

2.2.6 Thermogravimetric Measurements
and Analysis
of the Evolved Gases with Mass Spectrometry
Thermogravimetric
analyses (TGAs) on the samples before and after exposure to the vapors
of the aromatic compounds were made with a Seiko SSC 5200 thermal
analyzer equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESS, GeneSysQuadstar
422) to characterize the gases evolved during the thermal processes
(mass spectrometry evolved gas analysis, MS-EGA). Gas sampling by
the spectrometer was via an inert, fused silicon capillary system,
heated to prevent the condensation of gases. Gas analyses were performed
in multiple ion detection (MID) mode to determine the nature of the
evolved chemical species with temperature (or time). Background subtraction
was used to obtain the point zero conditions before starting MID analysis.
Measurements were performed on each air-dried sample under the following
experimental conditions: heating rate: 20 °C/min; heating range:
25–1200 °C; data measurement: every 0.5 s; purging gas:
ultrapure helium, flow rate: 100 μL/min. Mass analyses were
carried out in multiple ion detection mode measuring the m/z ratios 17 and 18 for H2O, 28 and 44
for CO2, 30 for NO and NO2, 34 for H2S, 46 for NO2, and 48, 64, and 66 for SO2 (m/z is the dimensionless ratio between
the mass number and the charge of an ion); secondary electron multiplier
(SEM) and FARADAY detector at 1100 V were employed with 1 s of integration
time on each measured mass. To avoid differences in relative humidity,
samples were equilibrated for 15 min inside the oven at 25 °C
using a 100 μL/min flow of ultrapure helium.

2.2.7 NMR Measurements
NMR spectra were
acquired at 300 K using an AVANCE III HD 600 Bruker spectrometer equipped
with a 2.5 mm H/X CPMAS probe operating at 600.13 and 150.90 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively. Samples were packed into
2.5 mm zirconia rotors and spun at the magic angle. 1H
NMR spectra were obtained at 30 or 33 kHz magic angle spinning (MAS)
rate, using DEPTH sequence18 in order to
remove baseline distortions, at 125 kHz spectral width, 10 s relaxation
delay, 2.3 μs 90° pulse, 4k data points, and 32 scans.
The empty rotor 1H spectrum was subtracted to compensate
for background effects.

Cross-polarization-MAS (CP-MAS) 13C NMR spectra were obtained at 16 kHz MAS rate, using the
standard Bruker CP sequence with 139 kHz spectral width, 1 s relaxation
delay, 2.3 μs 90° 1H pulse, radio frequency
field strength of about 62 kHz for Hartmann–Hahn match, 0.2
ms contact time, 4k data points, and 28k–32k scans.

All
chemical shifts were referenced by adjusting the spectrometer
field to the value corresponding to 38.48 ppm chemical shift for the
deshielded line of the adamantane 13C NMR signal, as previously
reported.19

2.2.8 Molecular
Modeling
A 3 × 2
× 1 supercell of Mt was created with one intercalated Fe(III)Phen
complex with the phenanthroline rings parallel with the clay (001)
surface and 12 water molecules per Fe complex, 6 water molecules coordinated
with the Fe atoms and 6 water molecules in the free space between
Fe complexes. This structure was previously optimized by means of
quantum mechanical calculations with the density functional theory
approximation using SIESTA code, whose details are described elsewhere.11

A double supercell was generated, being
a 3 × 4 × 1 of Mt and two Fe(III)Phen complexes. One of
these complexes was rotated in order to place both phenanthroline
moieties oriented to the same side maintaining all rings parallel
to the clay surface, creating a hydrophobic channel. The distances
between the phenanthroline complexes are 7.56–8.25 and 6.58
Å in the b and a axes directions,
respectively (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Molecular structure of the 3 × 4 × 1 supercell of Mt
with two Fe(III)Phen complexes with eight water molecules per Fe complex,
viewed from (010) (a) and (100) (b) planes. The Fe, H, O, N, C, Si,
Al, and Mg atoms are in purple, white, red, blue, gray, ochre, pink,
and green colors, respectively.

On the other hand, taking into account the amount of water
(2.96%,
see after) found experimentally by TGA in Mt–Fe(III)Phen showing
the maximum immobilization capacity of naph at 25 °C (Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25), eight water molecules were placed per Fe complex,
six coordinating the Fe cations and two water molecules disperse freely
between complexes. Periodic boundary conditions were applied for calculations
that were based on empirical interatomic potentials using the Universal
force field with the Forcite program within the Materials Studio package.20 Ewald summation was applied for the Coulomb
and van der Waals interactions with a cutoff at 15 Å. The atomic
charges were calculated with the QEq method21 considering that the whole system is neutral, the charge of the
clay mineral supercell is −8e–, the charge of each Fe complex without water molecules is +4e–, and each water and naphthalene molecule
was neutral.

The adsorption energy was calculated as  where ΔE (adsorption
energy) is the energy involved in the adsorption of the molecule(s)
of adsorbate (naphthalene) in the double supercell of Mt/Fe(III)Phen; Eadsorption complex is the total energy
of the double supercell of Mt/Fe(III)Phen hosting the molecule(s)
of the adsorbate (naphthalene); Eadsorbate is the total energy of the molecule(s) of the isolated adsorbate
species (naphthalene); and Ehost is the
total energy of the double supercell of Mt/Fe(III)Phen alone.

3 Results
3.1 Selective Trapping of Aromatic
Gas Phases
by Mt–Fe(III)Phen
Figure 2 shows the amount of benz, Clbenz, naph,
and Clnaph immobilized by Mt–Fe(III)Phen (qarom, expressed as moles of immobilized species per 100
g of Mt–Fe(III)Phen) as a function of the content of iron complex
in the adsorbent material (qcomplex, see Experimental Section) after 1 month of exposure
to the vapors of the aromatic compounds in a closed box at 25 and
50 °C. The experiments were therefore performed at a constant
partial pressure of the aromatic compound corresponding to its vapor
pressure at the fixed temperature.

Figure 2 Number of moles of aromatic compounds
immobilized at 25 (open symbols)
and 50 °C (filled symbols) per 100 g of Mt–Fe(III)Phen
(qarom) as a function of qcomplex [moles of Fe(III)Phen per 100 g of Mt–Fe(III)Phen].
(naph = triangle, Clnaph = circle, benz = diamond, Clbenz = square).

A long time of exposure (1 month)
was chosen to ensure that the
Mt–Fe(III)Phen sorbent reached saturation. Moreover, experiments
were made at two different temperature values to evaluate the role
played by the vapor pressure of the adsorbate. The most notable result
is that Mt–Fe(III)Phen traps large amounts of naph and Clnaph,
which are much larger than Clbenz, while benz is not adsorbed at all.
It is worth noting that plain Mt, not functionalized with the iron
complex, was not able to entrap any aromatic molecule at 25 and 50 °C.
Moreover, at both temperatures, the efficiency of the entrapping process
is strongly dependent on the content of iron complex in the adsorbent
material (Figure 2).
In particular, the plots reporting qarom versus qcomplex for naph and Clnaph
at 25 °C (Figure 2) show a maximum (qarommax) at qcomplex = 0.022 moles of Fe(III)Phen per 100 g of Mt–Fe(III)Phen
(i.e., at about 55% of the saturation limit for iron complex intercalation
in Mt), whereas the plots obtained for the same aromatic molecules
at 50 °C (Figure 2) show a maximum at qcomplex = 0.025
moles of Fe(III)Phen per 100 g of Mt–Fe(III)Phen (i.e., at
about 65% of the saturation limit for iron complex intercalation in
Mt). We note that these temperature-dependent qcomplex values at which the qarommax values are
obtained are independent of the nature of the entrapped molecule.

The maximum immobilization capacity (qarommax) strongly
increases with temperature. In fact, the qarommax value for
naph ranges from 0.035 mol/100 g Mt–FePhen at 25 °C to
0.060 mol/100 g Mt–FePhen at 50 °C and for Clnaph from
0.043 mol/100 g Mt–FePhen at 25 °C to 0.067 mol/100 g
Mt–FePhen at 50 °C. These entrapping performances are
remarkable because they were achieved at rather low vapor pressures
of adsorbates. At qcomplex values higher
than that corresponding to qarommax, the entrapping efficiency
clearly decreases and, at the saturation limit in Fe(III)Phen (qcomplex = 0.038), for naph and Clnaph, the immobilization
ability drops at about 60% (67%) and 35% (27%) of the qarommax at
25 °C (50 °C). Because of the low efficiency of Mt–Fe(III)Phen
in the immobilization of benz and Clbenz, data on these two aromatic
gaseous phases were omitted.

3.2 Temperature Dependence
of the Trapping Kinetics
for Naphthalene and 1-Chloronaphthalene
The adsorbing rates
of naph and Clnaph on Mt–Fe(III)Phen were obtained by measuring
the amounts of the aromatic compounds immobilized by Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50 (see Experimental Section) as a function of time at both
temperatures (Figure 3). Upon exposure to naph and Clnaph, the content in the aromatic
compound inside Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50 [calculated by the carbon content exceeding that of
Fe(III)Phen] strongly increases with time to reach a constant value
after about 48 h at 25 °C and after about 24 h at 50 °C
for both naph and Clnaph (Figure 3). These data show that the process takes place in
a single step and the entrapping process is fast, in particular at
50 °C, according to the increase of the partial pressure and
the adsorption rate constant with temperature. The amount of trapped
gas phase at 50 °C is about twice higher than at 25 °C.

Figure 3 Entrapping
kinetics of naph (triangle) and Clnaph (circle) by Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest25 at 25 (open symbols) and by Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50 at 50 °C (filled symbols). qarom is the number of moles of immobilized aromatic molecule
per 100 g of Mt–Fe(III)Phen. The Mt–Fe(III)Phen adsorbing
materials are prepared with qcomplex =
0.022 at 25 °C and qcomplex = 0.025
at 50 °C (see Experimental Section).

3.3 Thermogravimetric
Measurements and Regeneration/Reversibility
Tests on Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25
Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest25 saturated
in naph and Clnaph at 25 °C (Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25) were characterized by TGA and MS-EGA, respectively, to determine
the temperature of desorption and the nature of the released species
(Figures 4 and 5). The thermal behavior of Mt–Fe(III)Phen
alone was characterized previously.10 After
exposure to the aromatic molecules, major changes in TGA [(and its
first derivative curve, differential TGA (DTGA)] were observed in
the temperature range 110–300 °C (Figures 4 and 5). In particular,
the DTGA profiles of Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25 show a
well-defined peak at T = 70 °C and a shoulder
at about 135 °C that are related to the dehydration of the interlayer
(H2O release, m/z = 18),
already observed for Mt–Fe(III)Phen alone.10 A further noticeable thermal effect appears at about 220
°C for Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and
at 205 °C (the peak also shows a well-defined shoulder at 240
°C) for Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25.
This is not observed for Mt–Fe(III)Phen and can be related
to the release of the undecomposed aromatic molecule (naph release, m/z = 128, between 150 and 290 °C;
Clnaph release, m/z = 162 and 127
after the loss of Cl, between 160 and 340 °C). At temperatures
higher than 350 °C, the DTGA profiles closely resemble that obtained
for Mt–Fe(III)Phen alone and correspond to the thermal decomposition
of the iron complex and, afterward, to Mt dehydroxylation.10 The analysis of the thermogravimetric profiles
coupled with the MS-EGA shows that within the temperature range 20–350
°C, the mass loss due to dehydration is partially overlapped
to the desorption of the aromatic molecules. In the DTGA curves, however,
the peaks corresponding to the two processes are well resolved, allowing
assignment of the first process (at T about 70 °C)
to the emission of the interlayer water and the second mass loss (at
about 200–220 °C) to that of the aromatic compounds. In
Mt–Fe(III)Phen, the loss of interlayer water was previously
quantified being about 5.46%;10 the contributions
in mass loss due to water and aromatic molecule can be evaluated by
TGA: for Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25, these
contributions are 2.96 ± 0.26% of H2O and 4.12 ±
0.14% of naphthalene, while for Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25, they are 3.16 ± 0.24% of H2O and 6.21
± 0.48% of 1-chloronaphthalene.

and mass analysis of the
evolved gases as a function of temperature recorded at m/z = 18 (H2O), 30 (NO and NO2), 44 (CO2), and 128 (naph) of Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25; qcomplex = 0.022 moles
of Fe(III)Phen per 100 g Mt–Fe(III)Phen corresponding to the
maximum immobilization capacity at 25 °C.

Figure 5 Thermogravimetric curves (TGA and DTGA) and mass analysis of the
evolved gases as a function of temperature recorded at m/z = 18 (H2O), 30 (NO and NO2), 44 (CO2), and 162 (Clnaph) of Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25, qcomplex = 0.022 moles
of Fe(III)Phen per 100 g Mt–Fe(III)Phen corresponding to the
maximum immobilization capacity at 25 °C.

The contents in the aromatic compound determined by TGA (0.033
± 0.002 mol/100 g Mt–Fe(III)Phen for naph and 0.039 ±
0.003 mol/100 g Mt–Fe(III)Phen for Clnaph) are in good agreement
with those calculated by elemental analyses (0.035 ± 0.003 mol/100
g Mt–Fe(III)Phen for naph and 0.043 ± 0.002 mol/100 g
Mt–Fe(III)Phen for Clnaph both at 25 °C). The release
at relatively low temperature of the intact aromatic compound indicates
that Mt–Fe(III)Phen can be used several times as the adsorbent
material. Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25 were heated at 160, 180, and 200 °C to optimize
the conditions for material regeneration, in particular, to determine
the lowest temperature at which a complete and quick removal of the
aromatic compound is possible. In fact, Figures 4 and 5 show that the
maximum rates of the release of the aromatic compounds are reached
at 220 and 205 °C for naph and Clnaph, respectively, but the
release processes already start at about 160 °C.

The changes
in the content of aromatic molecules at the different
temperature values versus time are reported in Figure 6 for Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25. The rate of desorption is dependent on the treating temperature;
at all the temperatures, however, complete desorption can be obtained.
In particular, at 200 °C after 10 min a completely desorption
of naph and Clnaph occurs from Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest25. The thermal treatment at T ≤ 200 °C
is fully reversible for at least 20 cycles, that is, the hybrid material
can thermally release and, afterward, uptake the aromatic compound
again in the same amount and with a similar time course (Figure 7).

3.4 1H and 13C CP-MAS NMR
Characterization of Mt–Fe(III)Phen Exposed to Naphthalene and
1-Chloronaphthalene
1H NMR spectra (Figure 8) of the samples exposed to
naph (Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest50, Figure 8b) and Clnaph (Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest50, Figure 8a) confirm the presence of the aromatic molecules immobilized inside
Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50. In fact, together with signals
of structural hydroxyl protons at 2.8 and 1.4 ppm, a signal at 7.4
ppm appears after exposure to naph, whereas a resonance at 7.4 and
a shoulder at 8.2 ppm are observed in the case of Clnaph. These chemical
shifts parallel those observed in solution for the two host molecules.22 Both spectra are quite different from that of
Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50 (Figure 8c). The same holds for 13C CP-MAS
NMR spectra (Figure 9), which are both dominated by a signal at 126.6 and 127.5 ppm for
the samples exposed to naph and Clnaph, respectively.

and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest50 (red) are shown

Figure 9 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of (a) Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest50, (b) Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest50, and (c) Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50.

The comparison between the 1H NMR spectral
profiles
of Mt–Fe(III)Phen–Clnaphbest50 and Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest50 (inset Figure 8) shows that Clnaph signals at 8.2 and 7.4 ppm slightly exceed
that of naph at 7.4 ppm. Deconvolution of 1H NMR spectra
allows to derive a Clnaph/naph molar ratio of about 1.14, in fair
agreement with that obtained by elemental analysis (from Figure 2, at 50 °C: qClnaphmax/qnaphmax = 0.067/0.060 = 1.12). Structural hydroxyl protons are
found to be slightly shielded with respect to those of Mt–Fe(III)Phenbest50 (3.2 and 1.9 ppm) and even to those of Mt itself (3.0
and 1.7 ppm).19

3.5 Computational
Simulation of the Interlayer
of Mt–Fe(III)Phen Saturated with Naphthalene
The modeling
of the adsorbate gaseous phases into Mt–Fe(III)Phen was reported
only for naphthalene. The adsorbate molecules, naphthalene and naphthalene
dimer, were included in a cubic periodical box of 20 × 20 ×
20 Å. In the naphthalene dimer, both aromatic rings were parallel
and with the same orientation at a distance of 4 Å. The optimization
of this dimer maintained parallel both aromatic rings with one ring
rotated 90° with respect to another.

By placing one naphthalene
molecule between both phenanthroline complexes in a parallel disposition
with respect to the phenanthroline rings and the (001) clay surface,
the optimization yielded a structure with the naphthalene molecule
inclined between both phenanthroline complexes and not intercalated
inside the phenanthroline rings (Figure 10a). The shortest distances between the naphthalene
H atoms and the phenanthroline C atoms are at 3.5 Å. The adsorption
energy was −23.75 kcal/mol, indicating that this adsorption
is energetically favorable.

Figure 10 Molecular structure of the 3 × 4 ×
1 supercell of Mt
with two Fe(III)Phen complexes with eight water molecules per Fe complex
along with one (a) and two in parallel (b) and two in perpendicular
(c) and three in perpendicular (d) disposition with respect to the
mineral surface, adsorbed naphthalene molecules.

Two naphthalene molecules at 3.6 Å in a parallel disposition
were also placed in a similar initial position as above, parallel
to the clay surface. The optimized structure showed that both adsorbates
remained parallel at 3.5 Å and inclined with respect to the phenanthroline
complexes at 2.4–3.3 Å between naphthalene and phenanthroline
rings (Figure 10b).
Starting with the naphthalene molecules placed separately, one close
to the clay surface and another in the center of the interlayer space,
the optimization yielded the same above structure. The adsorption
energy was −45.4 kcal/mol, indicating also a highly favorable
process.

Besides, another initial configuration was considered,
placing
both naphthalene molecules in a perpendicular disposition with respect
to the mineral surface. The optimization of this structure showed
that the adsorbates remained in the same perpendicular disposition
with respect to the (001) clay surface (Figure 10c). The naphthalene rings remained parallel
at 3.45 Å. The distances between the naphthalene and phenanthroline
rings are at 2.28–2.70 Å. Besides, a certain interaction
between the naphthalene H atom and the mineral surface basal O atoms
is observed at 2.6 Å. The adsorption energy was higher, −52.16
kcal/mol. These short intermolecular distances explain the higher
adsorption energy of this model.

By taking into account that
the amount of naphthalene found experimentally
by TGA in this solid Mt–Fe(III)Phen–naphbest25 was 4.12%, this can be considered an adsorption of 1.5 molecules
of naphthalene per Fe complex. Then, we included three naphthalene
molecules in a parallel disposition and placed them perpendicularly
with respect to the (001) clay surface (Figure 10d). After the optimization, all naphthalene
molecules remained parallel with inter-ring distances of 3.66–3.70
Å and perpendicular to the (001) plane of the clay mineral. The
shortest distances between the naphthalene rings and the phenanthroline
rings are 2.84–2.98 Å. In the same way, this trimer of
naphthalene was optimized in a 20 × 20 × 20 Å box maintaining
all aromatic rings parallel with the middle ring rotated 90°
with respect to others. This rotation was not observed when this trimer
is intercalated in the clay interlayer space. The adsorption energy
was ΔE = −72.89 kcal/mol, indicating
an energetically favorable adsorption process according to the above
results.

4 Discussion
Mt–Fe(III)Phen
is able to rapidly immobilize a large amount
of naph and Clnaph but shows an extremely low affinity toward benz
and its chloro-derivative. Previous studies have shown that Mt adsorbs
Fe(III)Phen in excess (twice the cation exchange capacity, CEC) and
induces a structuring of the interlayer as a function of the amount
of the immobilized complex.10 The interaction
of Mt–Fe(III)Phen with aromatic species in the gas phase is
likely to be controlled by the presence and disposition of the aromatic
moiety of the iron complex mainly through the shaping of the interlayer
volume with hydrophobic channels and holes having suitable dimensions
for guest molecules. If the holes are large enough, π-stacking
interactions could be established between adjacent naphthalene rings.
Molecules with large aromatic regions, such as naphthalenes, yield
stronger intermolecular stacking interactions than benzene and its
derivatives, which are also more volatile. These reasons would explain
the larger affinity of Mt–Fe(III)Phen for naphthalenes than
benzenes: maybe shape and dimensions of the array made by three naphthalene
molecules, with strong π interactions, fit better with the available
hydrophobic nanospaces than the benzene-type ones. This selectivity
is a step ahead with respect to classical organoclays, which, albeit
showing highly hydrophobic interlayers, are not selective.

This
view is supported by the observation that the amount of adsorbed
molecules (qarom) as a function of the
composition of the adsorbent hybrid material (qcomplex) shows a maximum. In fact, the amount of immobilized
aromatic derivative is controlled by two opposite contributions: the
available volume in the interlayer and the amount of aromatic moieties
with which the adsorbate can interact. The peak of maximum adsorption
corresponds to a slightly higher amount of the stoichiometric proportion
related with the CEC capacity, named semi-saturated sample in previous
work.10,11 This excess of Fe complex acts as a pillaring
agent taking into account previous X-ray diffraction profiles, where
the d(001) spacing increased with a partial excess
of Fe complex.10 This corroborates previous
molecular modeling work where these excess Fe complexes have a perpendicular
disposition with respect to the interlayer surface, acting as pillars
in the interlayer space.11 These pillars
do not avoid the entrance of aromatics and the increase of d(001) spacing and internal free volume facilitates a slightly
higher adsorption capacity.

The maximum adsorption of naph and
Clnaph at 50 °C is observed
at a qcomplex value higher than that determined
at 25 °C. This result is probably related to the fact that temperature
disfavors entropically and enthalpically the adsorption process, which
is exothermic. Clnaph is immobilized to a larger extent than naph
at both temperatures, despite the larger vapor pressure of the latter
compound, especially at 50 °C. This effect could be related to
the dipole induced by Cl in the Clnaph molecule. The entrapping efficiency
for naph and Clnaph is larger at 50 °C than at 25 °C. High
temperature, although in general disfavors the adsorption processes,
increases the vapor pressure of the aromatic molecule, which enhances
the entrapment. However, this increase of vapor pressure with the
temperature is much higher than the increase of adsorption efficiency
(e.g., for Clnaph, P50°C/P25°C = 6.8, while q50°Cmax/q25°Cmax = 1.6). This can indicate that the intercalation of aromatics
decreases the entropy, that is, the adsorption has a negative entropy
contribution, explaining the lower increase in adsorption efficiency
with higher temperature with respect to the higher increase in vapor
pressure.

The entrapping performances, achieved at rather low
vapor pressures
of adsorbates, are similar or even higher than those obtained using
other well-known high-performance adsorbing materials such as synthetic
zeolites, active carbons, or organoclays.1 In organoclays, the intercalation of alkyl chains in the interlayer
imparts the material with the ability to bind exogenous molecules
through not specific hydrophobic interactions. The material proposed
here exploits the structuring effect that the iron complex has on
the interlayer10 to efficiently bind exogenous
aromatic hydrocarbons.

In addition, the immobilization rate
is also high at 25 °C
and the hybrid material also proved to be stable over time after treatment
at 200 °C and reusable. Desorption is also fast at 160 °C,
and the released species is the pristine species. This allows a quantitative
recovery of the aromatic species and adsorbent solid.

5 Conclusions
We have shown that Mt–Fe(III)Phen, a
hybrid material easily
obtained by fast intercalation of the Fe(III)–Phen complex
into Mt, is able to efficiently trap naphthalene and 1-chloronaphthalene
at the solid/gas interface. This property is related to the strong
interactions of these species with the aromatic moiety of the iron
complex, providing a stable immobilization. This process occurs at
room temperature and its characteristics can be modified changing
the composition (iron complex content) of the hybrid material. In
fact, the efficiency of Mt–Fe(III)Phen as naphthalenes trap
is controlled by the saturation level of the complex, which modulates
structuration, hydrophobicity, and availability of the aromatic moiety
inside the interlayer. In particular, structuration of the interlayer
probably results in the formation of a network of strongly hydrophobic
channels lined by the phenanthroline moieties of the Fe(III)Phen aggregates.
The immobilization is fast and fully reversible: the entrapping material
can be thermally regenerated and brought back to its full immobilizing
capacity quickly and in mild conditions. The high adsorption efficiency
of Mt–Fe(III)Phen is mainly determined by the unique nanostructure
and tailorable properties of the interlayer, which make it suitable
for the capture of various aromatic molecules which have a strong
environmental impact. Because the mechanism that controls naphthalene
immobilization probably involves the formation of stacking interactions
between molecules entrapped in hydrophobic interlayer spaces, the
structure and the extent of the hydrophobic channels are probably
the determinants of the observed entrapping activity of Mt–Fe(III)Phen.

The already proved entrapping ability of Mt–Fe(III)Phen
toward thiols and H2S has been here extended to the aromatic
molecules of environmental interest. The novelty of the present work
is the exploitation of the aromatic moiety of Fe(III)Phen, which is
able to structure the interlayer to form hydrophobic channels which
allow the specific entrapping of naphthalene and 1-chloronaphthalene.
We are also convinced that it is possible to expand the opportunities
offered by this approach employing other ligands with affinity for
aromatic moieties and extending the research to the study of the immobilization
of other aromatics.
