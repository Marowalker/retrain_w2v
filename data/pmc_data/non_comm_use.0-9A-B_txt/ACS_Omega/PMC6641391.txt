Durability and multifunctionality
are very important factors for
human skinlike tactile sensors for measuring physical stimuli if they
provide reasonable pressure measurement range and sensitivity. Here,
we propose a step tactile sensor with a simple processing unit, showing
high repeatability and mechanical stability without drifting caused
by thermal and geometrical noise. The proposed sensor, similar to
a switch mechanism, detects the applied pressure discretely and has
a wide pressure range of 2 kPa to 1.2 MPa according to its geometry.
The developed tactile sensor can be designed and fabricated in various
morphologies to detect a wide range of tactile stimuli, which help
in customizing the sensor as per user demand for practical applications
such as a prosthesis arm or hand. It is also easy to extend the sensor
size to cover a large area owing to the simple fabrication process
by using a 3D printer. Furthermore, with the addition of a flexible
exterior layer of leuco dyes and the polydimethylsiloxane mixture,
the color of a step tactile sensor not only resembles that of human
skin color but also changes its color depending on the temperature
changes as human skin does. Thus, the function of a pressure and temperature
indicator in a flexible step sensor finds practical applications in
various fields, including but not limited to prosthetic applications
for the customized and comfortable usage.

1 Introduction
Human
skin is a multifunctional sensory organ having the largest
area in our bodies. Human skin senses physical stimuli such as pressure,
temperature, and humidity from mechanoreceptors.1−3 Humans can control
body motion by reacting to external physical stimuli via tactile sensing
and feedback. Many research studies have been conducted to develop
skinlike tactile sensors such as electronic skin, which can detect
not only a touch but also a variety of stimuli for the application
in robotics,4−6 healthcare,7−11 and entertainment.12,13

Skinlike tactile sensors
should have the features of flexibility,
electrical and mechanical stability, and easy shape deformation for
practical applications because of complex geometries and harsh movements.
In the past decade, numerous efforts have been undertaken to develop
skinlike sensors with versatile morphology based on flexible and stretchable
materials.14−21 Various strategies, such as the use of a very thin substrate22,23 or a soft material24,25 and a combination of soft and
hard materials,26−28 have been adopted to achieve flexibility or stretchability.
Typical transducers for flexible tactile sensors mostly rely on capacitive,
resistive, magnetic, and optic mechanisms, each having its own advantages
and disadvantages. Resistive tactile sensors are usually classified
as piezoresistive type, which uses the piezoresistivity of intrinsic
materials,29,30 and contact resistive type, which
uses the variation in resistance between a structured conductor and
an electrode.31−33 Resistive tactile sensors require less electronics
and are easy to fabricate and integrate; however, they suffer from
hysteresis and drifting due to thermal noise. Capacitive tactile sensors
mostly detect the variation in thickness of the dielectric elastomer
sandwiched between the electrodes.34−36 They exhibit high spatial
resolution and have a large dynamic range; however, they are susceptible
to noise in mesh configurations because of crosstalk noise and field
interaction. Magnetic tactile sensors are highly sensitive and free
from hysteresis but suffer from crosstalk noise and electromagnetic
interference. Optical tactile sensors exhibit high repeatability and
spatial resolution; moreover, they are unaffected by electromagnetic
interference. However, they are not suitable for skin-type sensors
because of their bulky size and rigidness.37−39 Therefore,
many studies are still underway for developing skinlike tactile sensors
for practical applications.

This paper proposes a customizable
skinlike step sensor that detects
not only applied pressure discretely but also temperature visually.
The step sensor, based on the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate,
is a contact resistive-type sensor, and its operation principle is
based on the on/off mechanism similar to that of a switch. When pressure
is applied, the top and bottom electrodes are connected directly through
a hole in the intermediate layer, and then, the current flow is detected
from the digital I/O port on the processing unit. This sensor exhibits
different pressure responses depending on the ratio of the hole area
and inverse bumper area, and such a simple pressure-sensing mechanism
covers a wide pressure range from a few kPa to several MPa. Step sensors
with an appropriate combination of single cells can measure various
pressure ranges discretely. A simple fabrication process using a 3D
printer allows outstanding expandability to multiunits and serves
to customize the pressure range and spatial resolution according to
the required specification, for example, prosthesis parts such as
hand, forearm, and foot. Although step sensors cannot measure the
applied pressure precisely, they have a simple processing unit, high
repeatability, and mechanical stability without drifting caused by
thermal and geometrical noise. Furthermore, the inverse bumper layer,
composed of PDMS and thermochromic materials, not only detects temperature
visually but also provides the sensor a natural color resembling the
human skin.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 describes
the fabrication process of a step tactile sensor. It consists of four
flexible layers: bottom electrode layer, intermediate layer, top electrode
layer, and inverse bumper layer. The bottom and top electrode substrates
are made of PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning Co.), comprising a base
prepolymer and a crosslinking agent (10:1 weight ratio), by spin-coating
at 350 rpm, as shown in Figure 1a. Electric signal lines, shaped as stripes, are developed
by AgNW spray-coating using a 3D-printed shadow mask on a 140 μm
thick PDMS substrate, as shown in Figure 1b. To improve the adhesion strength between
the AgNW and PDMS substrate of the top and bottom layers, the PDMS
substrate is treated with oxygen plasma before spray-coating. The
spray-coated bottom and top electrode layers are annealed to improve
the electrical conductivity of the coated AgNW on a 200 °C hotplate
for 20 min. The 40 μm thick intermediate layer with the hole
area in the range of 0.16–8.41 mm2 is printed with
the PDMS solution by a 3D printer (PROTEX Co.) on the bottom electrode
layer, as shown in Figure 1c. The liquid bridge phenomenon might arise in the patterning
due to the low viscosity of PDMS when the 3D printer creates a void
region for the hole pattern. To avoid this problem, the temperature
of the hotplate and manipulation direction of the injector should
be appropriately selected during PDMS printing, as shown in Figure
S1, Supporting Information; hence, the
bottom electrode layer is placed on a 110 °C hotplate during
intermediate layer printing. The cover, that is, the inverse bumper
layer is developed from a mixture of leuco dyes of red and yellow,
white silicone pigment, and the PDMS solution for exhibiting human
skin color. Depending on the ratio of the leuco dye and white pigment
in the PDMS solution, the cover of the step sensor can represent various
colors. The mixture is coated by using a spin coater at 350 rpm, and
then, an inverse bump is patterned on the spin-coated PDMS mixture
of 140 μm thickness using a 3D printer, as shown in Figure 1d. Finally, all the
layers are carefully aligned on the hotplate heated at 80 °C,
as shown in Figure 1e. Figure 1f shows
the fabricated 4 × 10 multiunit step sensor.

Single cells and multiunits of
step sensors are characterized by
measuring the variation in their electrical resistance. Pressure is
applied to each single cell of a step sensor through the bump with
a contact area of 8.41 mm2 by using a custom-made pressure
measurement system at a speed of 0.5 mm/min, and then, the resistance
value is transferred to a processing computer through RS232 serial
communications. Each electrical line of the 4 × 10 multiunit
step sensor is connected to digital I/O ports of the processing board
(Arduino Uno, Arduino Co.), and the data are transferred to a processing
computer through USB serial communications. The collected data are
analyzed by MATLAB software and then represented graphically using
the MATLAB GUI function. A single cell of a step sensor consists of
the following four layers—bottom electrode layer, intermediate
layer with various areas of the hole pattern, top electrode layer,
and inverse bumper layer—as shown in Figure 2a. In each single unit, the bottom electrode
is intersected with the top electrode, the intermediate layer with
various holes is placed between the bottom and top electrodes, as
shown in Figure 2b,
and the applied pressure is concentrated on the sensing cell by the
inverse bumper layer over the top electrode. Under pressure, the step
sensor, similar to a switch mechanism, detects an on/off current signal
through an interconnection between the top and bottom electrodes.
In the initial state, the resistance of the sensing cell is almost
infinity because the bottom electrode stays away from the top electrode.
The electrodes are connected directly by deformation of the top electrode
layer and the resistance of the single cell decreases to a few kΩ
under applied pressure. Then, the signal processing system detects
the pressure by the flow of current to the digital I/O port in the
processing unit. The deformation of the top electrode layer is determined
from its Young’s modulus, inverse bumper area (w2), distance between two electrodes (s), hole area (d2), and thickness of the
top electrode layer (t). Therefore, the response
pressure of the step tactile sensor is designed by tuning several
factors. Here, PDMS, with a Young’s modulus of 833 kPa, is
used in the formation of each layer for flexibility, and the thickness
of the intermediate layer, that is, the distance between two electrodes
(s), is fixed at 40 μm. The main factor of
the response pressure is designed by modulating the hole area. In
the proposed step tactile sensor, four single cells with different
hole areas compose a single unit, which can detect four different
pressures. This means that the step sensor measures the applied pressure
discretely, such as a threshold indicator, because this sensor exhibits
a noncontinuous signal. Furthermore, the step sensor exhibits outstanding
extendability because of its simple structure and sensing mechanism. Figure 2c shows a 4 ×
10 multiunit sensor, which encompasses four steps.

A resistive pressure
sensor typically employs the following two
mechanisms: intrinsic materials’ piezoresistivity and contact
resistance between the resistor and the electrode. A resistive pressure
sensor using piezoresistivity not only exhibits high sensitivity but
also suffers from large hysteresis and a large thermal effect. To
overcome these drawbacks, a contact resistive-type sensor with a pyramid
or a microdome-patterned piezoresistor has been extensively studied.40 The speed of recovery to the initial state of
the microstructure is faster than that of the solid structure because
of the void region created between the micropatterns under decreasing
pressure. Therefore, this sensor can reduce hysteresis because of
its intrinsic viscoelastic characteristics. In the case of a step
sensor, when pressure is applied, the top electrode is suspended on
the hole pattern of the intermediate layer, and the suspended part
of the top electrode is deformed into a cone shape before making contact
with the bottom electrode. Eventually, the step sensor has a fractional
hysteresis of within 4.76% because the geometry of the cone shape
contributes to the low, similar to the case of a pyramid structure,
as shown in Figure 3a. Figure 3b shows
that the response times of the step sensor, whose resistance reaches
a few kΩ from hundreds of MΩ, are 120 and 90 ms under
loading and unloading, respectively. To investigate the reliability
of the step sensor, a repeated pressure of 0.5 Hz is applied to the
single cell while monitoring the variation in resistance in real time.
The step sensor shows a uniform response under pressure applied repeatedly
for 1000 times, as shown in Figure 3c; the extracted result at several intervals of the
step sensor is shown in Figure 3d. These results demonstrate the robust and durable sensing
performance of a step tactile sensor. However, there is a limit to
show the good response at high frequency because of its visco-elastic
characteristics.

graph of voltage variation at first 15 s (upper) and last 15 s (lower).

To apply a pressure sensor for
feedback on practical applications,
the performance of the pressure sensor in terms of sensitivity, pressure
range, and spatial resolution should be customized according to the
requirements of usages because overload might arise because of excessive
pressure feedback.41 For instance, a prosthetic
hand requires high spatial resolution and high sensitivity, whereas
the industrial robot arm requires low sensitivity and a wide range.
A step tactile sensor that acts as a pressure indicator can provide
adequate choice of the pressure range, sensitivity, and spatial resolution
as per user demand. Deformation of the top electrode layer under applied
pressure is determined by the ratio (w/d) and thickness of this layer. The relationship of pressure response
and the ratio of the length (w/d) have been analyzed in a previous study.42Figure 4a describes
the pressure response of a single cell with three thicknesses of the
top electrode layer according to increasing area ratio (w2/d2) of the inverse bumper
and hole areas. The area of the inverse bumper is fixed to 4 mm2, the hole area of the intermediate layer is changed gradually
from 0.16 to 8.41 mm2, and finally, the ratio is varied
from 25.0 to 0.48. Therefore, the larger the hole area, the lower
the pressure response. Also, the effects of the top electrode layer
of 140, 170, and 190 μm thicknesses on pressure are shown in Figure 4a. A single cell
of 140 μm thickness detects the lowest pressure of 2 kPa at
a hole area of 8.41 mm2. The pressure response of a single-cell
step sensor is measured up to 1.23 MPa at a top electrode layer of
190 μm thickness, and the response is linear with an increasing
ratio (w2/d2). These results show the potential of a step tactile sensor for
customized function in sensitivity, pressure range, and spatial resolution
just by tuning the hole area and layer thickness. Furthermore, the
3D printing process helps to control the size and spatial resolution
of the step sensor. Figure 4b shows the real-time voltage response of a single unit for
each single cell. A single unit of the step sensor is composed of
four hole areas of 4.62, 2.56, 1.96, and 1.32 mm2. Each
single cell responds at different pressures, as expected. On the basis
of the suggested tactile sensing mechanism, a single unit of a step
sensor can detect several pressure ranges and design various step
sensors according to the practical application demand. For instance,
on average, the human foot feels a pressure of up to 200 kPa.43 The step sensor for a prosthetic foot can be
composed of single cells with a ratio of less than 5.0 for detecting
pressure under 200 kPa when the top layer has a thickness of 170 μm,
while the step sensor with a top electrode layer of 140 μm thickness
can use larger ratios of up to 25.0. Figure 4c shows the variation in response pressure
under different temperatures. The temperature controlled by the thermoelectric
element is transferred to a single-cell step sensor, and the pressure
response is measured. A typical resistive-type sensor is affected
by temperature because the mobility of electrons is determined by
temperature. However, step sensors show only 3% error in pressure
response under the temperature variation in the range of 10–90
°C because they respond only when the top electrode contacts
the bottom electrode. The robustness in flexibility of the step sensor
is also investigated with bending in various curvatures. Figure 4d shows the robustness
of the step sensor under surfaces of various curvature radii. The
step sensor is placed on surfaces of various curvature radii, which
are selected by measuring the curvature radius for several body parts
and the pressure at the point of a sharp drop in resistance. The pressure
response has a scarce error of within 4%.

response of a single cell of 4.62 mm2 hole area attached

The multiunit step tactile sensor is fabricated by the distribution
of a single unit with four hole areas and skinlike color in the inverse
bumper layer. The fabricated multiunit sensor has 40 single units,
7 mm spatial resolution, and pressure range of 6.37–17.15 kPa.
Therefore, a single unit of the sensor can detect four pressure ranges,
and the cover of the sensor with leuco dye indicates the variation
in temperature. The shadow effect arises in the step sensor of a multiarrayed
matrix form by the scanning method, and it is known that an unexpected
sensing cell is detected when many sensing cells are pressed simultaneously.
A typical mechanism for avoiding the shadow effect is inserting a
diode in each sensing cell.44 We design
a step sensor with electric signal lines of resistance as high as
several kΩ because an unexpected cell operated by the shadow
effect has a higher resistance than the original cell due to the long
path. Then, the shadow effect is removed completely, as shown in Figure
S2, Supporting Information, because the
current over 0.1 A is only detected on the digital I/O port used in
the microcontroller unit. Figure 5a,b shows the performance of the multiunit step sensor
under varying pressure and temperature. The white, yellow, and red
boxes indicate the applied pressures of 6.37 kPa, 11.64 kPa, and over
17.15 kPa, respectively. As shown in Video S1, the multiunit step sensor detects a weight of 100 g, and the color
of the sensor skin changes from human skin color to white color when
hot air at around 100 °C is blown, and once the hot air is removed,
the original color is recovered. The pressure feedback system is demonstrated
simply without any process unit, using a single-cell step sensor,
3 V battery, and vibrator, as shown in Figure 5c. The single-cell step sensor is attached
on the fingertip, and each element is connected by a gold wire of
50 μm thickness. The single-cell step sensor responds by hitting
the ground, and then, the vibrator is vitalized as shown in Figure 5d and Video S2. This shows a customized, flexible pressure,
and temperature step sensor with a natural appearing color and applied
pressure feedback system with a simple element.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we developed a customizable, flexible pressure, and
temperature step sensor with a natural appearing color. The developed
step sensor has 4 × 10 single units of a wide sensing range of
2 kPa to 1.23 MPa pressure. A single cell of the step sensor responds
at different pressures according to the geometric condition of the
sensor structure, and then, a single unit with four different single
cells detects four different pressure levels. The step sensor shows
customizable function in sensitivity, pressure range, and spatial
resolution just by modulating the hole area and layer thickness. Moreover,
the simple sensing mechanism provides mechanical stability without
hysteresis and thermal effect (range from 10 to 90 °C). The sensor
skin with natural appearance is made of a mixture of PDMS and thermochromic
dyes, and the skin color changes over 40 °C with a human response
under hot physical stimuli. The proposed step tactile sensor with
outstanding extendability, fabricated by an easy process using a 3D
printer, shows the potential for robotic and prosthesis applications
with various shapes, sensing ranges, spatial resolutions, and sensitivities.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Details of AgNW Electrodes
An AgNW
(AgNW ink, NANOPYXIS Co.) of 35–45 nm diameter and 15–25
μm length is diluted in 0.3 wt % isopropyl alcohol. The AgNW
is spray-coated using a shadow mask created by a 3D printer (Object
pro, Stratasys Ltd.) on the oxygen plasma-treated PDMS substrate.
The spray nozzle is placed 15 cm apart from the plate, and the spraying
speed is about 25 mm/s. The AgNW is spray-coated three times for electrical
stability; the resistance of the single electrode line, whose line
width is 2 mm, is about 20 Ω/mm, and the transparency of the
spray-coated AgNW is about 84.95%, as shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information.

4.2 Details
of a Temperature Indicator with a
Thermochromic Cover Layer
Thermochromism is a property of
substances to change color with variation in temperature. It exists
in two forms: liquid crystal type and leuco dye type. The leuco dye
easily disperses in silicone rubber such as a PDMS prepolymer, and
the thermochromic dye offers more intuitive color than liquid crystal-type
thermochromic dye. In the case of step sensors, two types of leuco
dyes with different temperature responses are selected, and the initial
color can be customized according to the ratio of each dye depending
on user specification. As shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information, the color of the mixture of thermochromic
and PDMS materials changes with temperature, from the intrinsic characteristic
of the leuco dye, which is a colorless form, to scarlet and white
at 40 and 70 °C, respectively.
