The
distribution of 12 environmental contaminants or metabolites with
diverse polarities (2,2′,4,4′,5-pentabromodiphenyl ether;
bisphenol A; estrone; glyphosate; β-hexabromocyclododecane;
imidacloprid; 2,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl; 3′-methylsulfone
2,2′,4,5,5′-pentachlorobiphenyl; 1,2,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; 2-hydroxy-1,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; tetrabromobisphenol A; and triclocarban) among skim milk,
fat, curd, whey, whey retentate, and whey permeate was characterized.
Analysis of these compounds along with 15 drugs previously studied
provided a robust linear model predicting the distribution between
skim and fat and the chemical’s lipophilicity (log P, r2 = 0.71; log D, r2 = 0.79). Similarly, distribution
between curd and whey was correlated with lipophilicity (log P, r2 = 0.63; log D, r2 = 0.73). Phenolic compounds had
less predictable distribution patterns based on their lipophilicities.
Within the whey fraction, chemicals with greater lipophilicity are
associated with whey proteins more than hydrophilic chemicals. The
resultant model could help predict the potential distribution of chemical
contaminants among milk products in cow milk, if present.

Introduction
Pesticides or environmental
contaminants of milk or milk products may occur after the consumption
of contaminated feed, exposure to contaminated facilities, and/or
contamination during milk handling, transport, and/or processing.
Reported levels of pesticides and/or persistent organic pollutants
in milk vary depending on geographic region, year of survey, and chemical
classes analyzed.1−6 The distribution of a chemical among a variety of milk products
is dependent on its physicochemical properties, the milk processing
methods used, and the final milk products produced.

Previously,
we tested the hypothesis that drug distribution among milk fractions
could be predicted based on lipophilicity (log D,
distribution coefficients or log P, partition coefficients).7−9 A mixed linear model was proposed for the distribution between milk
fat and skim milk based on the study of seven veterinary drugs (Table S1).7 The seven
drugs included four antibiotics [erythromycin (ERY), penicillin G
(PENG), oxytetracycline (OTET), and sulfadimethoxine (SDMX)], two
anthelmintics [ivermectin (IVR) and thiabendazole (THIA)], and one
analgesic [ketoprofen (KETO)]. A linear model of the same drugs was
also described for the distribution between curd and whey, as well
as whey protein associations.8 The model
was then expanded to include four additional antibiotics [ciprofloxacin
(CIPR), clarithromycin (CLA), thiamphenicol (TAP), and phenylbutazone
(PBZ)], three analgesics/antipyretics [acetylsalicylic acid (ASP)/salicylic
acid, acetaminophen (TYL), and flunixin (FNX)], and one anthelmintic
[praziquantel (PZQ)] (Table S2).9 The distribution model fit (r2) decreased when the data set was expanded from 7 to
15 drugs;9 however, modeling based on log D values still provided a better fit than those based on
log P.

In this report, we consider 12 environmental
contaminants to better understand the possible impacts of a broader
range of log D and log P values
on xenobiotic distribution in milk. Specifically, we studied the herbicide
glyphosate (GLY); an insecticide, imidacloprid (IMI); a common component
of plastics and canned food liners, bisphenol A (BPA); an antibacterial,
triclocarban (TCC); a steroid hormone, estrone (E1); several brominated
flame retardants, β-hexabromocyclododecane (β-HBCD), tetrabromobisphenol
A (TBBPA), and 2,2′,4,4′,5-pentabromodiphenyl ether
(BDE-99); and a number of persistent organic pollutants and their
metabolites [1,2,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(1,2,7,8-TCDD); 2-hydroxy-1,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2-OH-1378-TCDD); 2,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl
(PCB-118); and 3′-methylsulfone-2,2′,4,5,5′-pentachlorobiphenyl
(3′-MeSO2-PCB-101)]. To the best of our knowledge,
the fate/distribution of these chemicals in milk processing has not
been reported. The chemicals studied in this report expands the polarity
range of the previous studies (now spanning log D from −4.2 to 7.3) and fills in the knowledge gap for chemicals
with log D values between 3.4 and 6.6. Data obtained
from this study have been combined with data from our previous reports,7−9 allowing us to expand distribution modeling to include a total of
27 chemicals.

Results and Discussion
Chemical Distribution from
Whole Milk into Milk Fat and Skim Milk
Milk partitioning
into lipid was highly reproducible, with typical coefficient of variance
(CV) values of ≤5%; exception was GLY with CV up to 19% (Tables S5–S16). The high CV of GLY was
due to its low partitioning into milk fat (Table S5). Similarly, CV of partitioning into skim milk was ≤5%;
exceptions were BDE, β-HBCD, 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101,
PCB, and TCC because of low amounts in the skim milk. Recoveries (sum
of total radioactivity in skim milk and milk fat) were >90%, ranging
from ∼91% (for chemicals with log D ≥
6.7) up to 100% for GLY (Figure 1 and Tables S5–S16). Distribution of chemical residues was not dose-dependent over
the range of doses used (linear regression slope P > 0.05), suggesting that a chemical’s distribution between
skim milk and milk fat would be constant regardless of the concentration.
In the absence of overt physiologic effects such as toxicity or effects
on blood flow to the mammary gland, such results suggest that whole
milk composition (i.e., across species or breed types) would influence
a chemical’s presence in milk to a greater extent than the
dose received.

skim milk) to the initial drug concentration in whole milk ±

For the 12 chemicals tested, distribution
into milk fat ranged from <3% (0.95% for GLY and 2.5% for IMI)
to >80% of the total amount added (3′-MeSO2-PCB-101,
TCC, PCB-118, β-HBCD, 1278-TCDD, and BDE-99). Intermediate distributions
into milk fat occurred for phenolic compounds (BPA, 39%; TBBPA, 46%;
2-OH-1378-TCDD, 54%; and E1, 74%) (Tables S5–S16, Figure 1).

As would be anticipated, the data indicated that nonpolar chemicals
concentrate into high lipid milk fractions. The concentration ratios
in milk fat relative to whole milk for moderately polar phenolic compounds
were about 10 (BPA, 8.2; TBBPA, 10.5; 2-OH-1378-TCDD, 11.2; and E1,
15.8) and were ∼18–20 for highly nonpolar persistent
environmental contaminants (BDE-99, β-HBCD, 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101, PCB-118, TCC, and 1278-TCDD; Figure 1). Also as expected, polar chemicals partitioned
to a large degree into skim milk, resulting in milk fat/whole milk
concentration ratios of <1 (GLY was 0.2, and IMI was 0.5; Figure 1). For the phenolic
compound BPA, substitution of four phenyl hydrogens with bromines
to form TBBPA (Table 1) increased lipophilicity (log D = 3.60 vs 6.69)
and was reflected by TBBPA’s milk fat/whole milk concentration
ratio of 10.5 compared to that of 8.2 for BPA (Figure 1). Hydroxylation of a molecule decreases
its relative lipophilicity with respect to its nonhydroxylated analogue,
as is commonly observed during oxidative metabolism. Although 1278-TCDD
and 2-OH-1378-TCDD have very similar log D values
(6.15 and 6.22, respectively) hydroxylation resulted in reduced lipid
solubility and a ∼30% reduction in milk fat distribution. However,
the addition of a more polar functional group onto a pentachloro biphenyl
molecule to form 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101 did not shift
the milk fat distribution pattern when compared to PCB-118. One possible
explanation may be due to the change of chlorine substitution pattern.

Although literature
describing the milk partitioning of the exact compounds studied here
has not been found, there are several relevant studies available for
comparison. For example, Jensen and Hummel15 administered 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid containing 2,3,7,8-TCDD
to lactating dairy cows and found that 2,3,7,8-TCDD residues in cream
exceeded those in milk by a factor of about 10. Although this is much
lower than our reported ratio of ∼19 for 1,2,7,8-TCDD (Figure 1), the difference
could originate from the “medium heavy cream” used in
the Jensen and Hummel study15 which would
have a fat content <36%. On the basis of our previous reports by
Hakk et al.7 and Lupton et al.,9 our milk fat had an average fat content of 82%.
Regardless, our data confirmed those of Jensen and Hummel15 in that the majority of dioxin residues would
be associated with milk fat.

Compounds with a log D or P value of about 6 consistently concentrated
in milk fat (or cream as cited in references). Concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DDT, Table S4) (log D 6.22 and log P = 5.92) in raw whole milk (5% lipid),
skim milk, and cream (70% lipid) were reported as 7.5, 0.2, and 67.2
ppm, respectively, with a cream/whole milk ratio of 9.0.16 Pasteurization produced a slight increase of
the cream/whole milk distribution ratio, as pasteurized whole milk
contained 6.0 ppm and cream contained 70.2 ppm DDT resulting in a
cream/whole milk ratio of 12.16 Langlois
et al.17 reported the identical ratio of
cream/whole milk for DDT in spite of a fat content for cream of only
37%. Relative to the Mann16 and Langois
et al.17 reports, higher milk fat/whole
milk concentration ratios were found in this study for compounds having
log P = ∼6 (TCC, log P =
5.39, ratio 17.6; 1278-TCDD, log P = 6.22, ratio
18.7; PCB-118, log P = 6.78, ratio 19.5; Figure 1), which is also
consistent with IVR (log P = 6.61, ratio 18.4) as
reported by Hakk et al.7 The exception
was 2-OH-1378-TCDD (log P = 6.15) which had a milk
fat/whole milk concentration ratio of 11.2 in this study (Figure 1). These lower concentration
ratios reported in the literature versus the current findings may
be a reflection of differences in composition of the milk fat prepared
here and the cream prepared in the cited reports.

A compound
with a log P value similar to that of BPA (log P = 3.60) is the organophosphate cruformate (log P = 3.33, Table S4), which was
fed to cows.18 Similar to BPA, which concentrated
eightfold in fat relative to whole milk, cruformate concentrated about
fivefold into cream.18 If values were adjusted
to reflect lipid mass yield (15% of whole milk in their study, 10%
in ours) the fivefold concentration would increase to ∼7.6-fold,
in close agreement with the eightfold concentration found for BPA.
For fenthion (log P = 3.21, Table S4), an organothiophosphate insecticide, the concentration
ratio of fat/whole milk was ∼5, with 80–90% of the fenthion
found in the fat fractions.19 In the current
work, the E1 (log P = 3.62) milk fat/whole milk concentration
ratio was ∼16 and 3′-MeSO2-PCB (log P = 4.62, calculated) was ∼18. Thus, the present
results and those of O’Keeffe et al.18,19 suggested that factors in addition to log P also
govern chemical disposition in milk.

Similar to the studies
done by Hakk et al.7 and Lupton et al.,9 GLY and IMI (this study) distributed predominantly
into the skim milk; thus, the concentration ratio between skim milk/whole
milk was ∼1, whereas the ratio of milk fat/whole milk was ∼0.2
(Figure 1). Hakk et
al.7 observed similar distributions for
compounds with low log D values, for example, OTET,
PENG, and ERY, as did Lupton et al.9 for
ASP, CIPR, TAP, and TYL despite the diversity of chemical structures.

Using literature values of log P and pKa for each chemical (Tables 1, S1, and S2),
mean and standard deviation (SD) log D values were
calculated for ionizable compounds.14 Relationships
between log D or log P values and
log [milk fat]/[skim milk] distributions, including 99% confidence
interval (CI) and prediction interval, are shown in Figure 2A (log D)
and 2B (log P). There are
apparent uncertainties with respect to log D or log P for many of the studied compounds (Figure 2A,B). In general, distribution uncertainties
with regard to log D or log P are
much greater than the error associated with measurements of milk fat
or skim partitioning. By combining the log [milk fat]/[skim milk]
data of the current set with results obtained from those of Hakk et
al.7 and Lupton et al.,9 the linear regression with log D had a
regression coefficient of 0.79 and with log P, the
resulting linear regression had an r2 =
0.71 (Figure 2A,B).
The slightly better regression using log D data reinforces
the conclusions of Hakk et al.7 and Lupton
et al.9 that log D was
a better predictor of the distribution between milk fat and skim milk
than log P. Nevertheless, Figure 2A indicates that based on the 99% CI for
log D, numerous outliers were present when all 27
compounds were modeled. Outliers with respect to the 99% CI for the
log D plot (Figure 2A) included ERY, FNX, TAP, TBBPA, 2-OH-1378-TCDD, and
TYL, compounds which distributed more toward skim than predicted.
2-OH-1378-TCDD likely would fall within the 99% CI based on the SD
of the calculated log D. Conversely, E1, 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101, OTET, PBZ, and PZQ distributed more toward milk
fat than predicted. Overall, the greatest limitation to predicting
the behavior of any one chemical contaminant in milk seems to be the
uncertainty associated with literature log P and
pKa values used to calculate log D values in the model derivation.

Slopes of the linear log D and log P models were not 1, but 0.33 and 0.39, respectively (Figure 2). There was no reason
to expect a 1:1 relationship between log D or P values of a chemical and its distribution between milk
fat and skim milk. The lower slopes do indicate modeled chemicals
that typically distribute to a greater extent into skim milk than
merely reflected by their log D or P values. Distribution data were not affected by the presence of degradates
because none were detected by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Table S3). The model slopes highlight the differences
between the simple, ideal, octanol/water partition system and the
complex milk matrix which consists of water, lipid, protein, sugar,
minerals, and micelles. We hypothesize that the presence of these
additional milk components could account for the enhanced distribution
into skim milk. For instance, milk proteins (casein, β-lactoglobulin,
and lactalbumin) enhanced the solubilization of DDT in water.20

Chemical Distribution from Skim Milk into
Curd and Whey
Recoveries of radioactivity across tested chemicals
were ≥95% (sum of whey and curd), with the highest mean recovery
(106.5%) occurring for β-HBCD and the lowest recovery occurring
for PCB-118 (90.7%). The CVs for within dose replicates in whey and
curd were generally <4% for the majority of chemicals tested; however,
the CVs for the most lipophilic persistent organic pollutants, that
is, 1278-TCDD, BDE-99, β-HBCD, 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101,
and PCB-118, were considerably higher, exceeding 3% for whey (range
3.9–16.0%) and 4% for curd (range 4.3–10.0%; Figure 3 and Tables S17–S28). Higher CVs for these
lipophilic chemicals in whey are to be expected, especially at lower
concentrations, because of the small percentage of each compound that
distributed into whey. Chemical distributions were generally not dose-dependent
for 0% moisture curd/whey ratios across the starting concentrations
present in skim milk, although a dose dependency was apparent for
BDE-99 (p < 0.05). An ∼8% increase in association
with the curd fraction was measured with BDE-99 with each 10-fold
increase in dose, that is, from 73% to 80% to 92%, respectively. Initial
concentrations in skim milk were 1.7, 13, and 204 nM (Table S28).

initial drug concentration in skim milk ± SD. BDE-99 distribution
was dose-dependent (P < 0.05). Sum of stacked
plots represents total, unadjusted drug recovery values.

For the 12 compounds tested in the current study,
chemicals retained in the curd fraction ranged from approximately
16.5% for GLY to 86% for β-HBCD when related to residual chemical
in the skim milk of phase 1 (Tables S17–S28). Distribution into curd was largely proportional to a chemical’s
lipophilicity. Of the most lipophilic compounds tested, ∼ 80%
of chemical was distributed into curd (1278-TCDD, BDE-99, β-HBCD,
and PCB-118). Compounds having moderate lipophilicity, that is, TBBPA,
3′-MeSO2-PCB-101, 2-OH-1378-TCDD, and TCC, were
more evenly distributed into both curd (40–60%) and whey (35–60%).
Highly polar compounds had the lowest affinity for curd, for example,
GLY (16.5%) followed by IMI (23.7%; Figure 3, Tables S17–S28).

When curd data (normally 70% moisture) were expressed on
a dry matter basis, the concentration ratios of 0% moisture curd to
whey (Tables S17–S28) were >100
for the most lipophilic compounds, that is, 1278-TCDD (115), BDE-99
(327), β-HBCD (152), and PCB-118 (136), and for two of the phenolics,
BPA (111) and E1 (104). Other phenolic compounds, that is, TBBPA and
2-OH-1378-TCDD, had much lower concentration ratios of 32 and 18,
respectively, whereas 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101 (56) and
TCC (46) were also lower than the most lipophilic compounds. The 0%
moisture curd/whey concentration ratios for the most polar compounds
ranged from 9.2 for IMI to 2.5 for GLY (Tables S17–S28).

Results for TBBPA were unexpected based
on its structural similarity to BPA. The fire-retardant TBBPA is identical
in the base structure to the plasticizer BPA with the exception that
the 4-ortho hydrogens, with respect to the phenolic hydroxyls, are
replaced by bromines. Bromination of the ortho-protons enhanced lipophilicity
(log P) of TBBPA compared to BPA. In the 0% moisture
curd/whey, however, the concentration ratio decreased from 111 for
BPA to 32 for TBBPA (Tables S17–S28). Based solely on lipophilicity (log P), the curd/whey
concentration ratio would have been expected to increase for TBBPA
relative to BPA. One possibility for the lower concentration ratio
for TBBPA is that the much larger atomic radius of bromine (compared
to hydrogen) resulted in steric hindrances for potential casein–TBBPA
interactions.

Hydroxylation and methylsulfonation of chemicals
altered distribution patterns in milk. Aromatic hydroxylation decreased
lipophilicity slightly and thus increased distribution into skim milk
for phase 1 and into whey for phase 2. For example, 2-OH-1378-TCDD
had a greater distribution into the whey (∼30% greater) compared
to 1278-TCDD. Comparison of PCB-118 and 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101 also indicated that a methyl sulfone group decreased lipophilicity
(log D 6.38 vs 4.62, respectively) and increased
(>25%) distribution into whey. Despite a different chlorine substitution
pattern between this pair of chemicals, the presence or absence of
a methyl sulfone functional group likely plays a more important role
in determining the effect on curd versus whey distribution. The full
nature of this partitioning difference is undoubtedly based on more
than hydrophobic interaction, for example, possible chemical/protein
interactions or sequestration.

Published reports related to
the partitioning of chemicals tested in this study into whey and curd
are scant, but structures and characteristics of chemicals cited for
comparison are provided in Table S4. For
example, concentrations of the aromatic, chlorinated insecticide DDT
(log D = 6.22 and log P = 5.92)
were greater in cheddar cheese than in whey after milk processing,
with cheese and whey concentrations of 47 and 0.5 ppm, respectively.16 Similarly, Swiss-type cheese made from milk
produced by dairy cows fed DDT contained ∼8 times the original
DDT concentration of whole milk, though DDT was not reported in whey.17 In other studies, however, DDT was unstable
during processing and 27–53% of the starting DDT degraded to
DDE and DDD21 during the manufacturing
of cheese. While DDT was not identified in whey at the dipping stage,
it was measured in the whey pressed from curd.22 Whey produced during the processing of raw whole milk had
levels of DDE and DDD that increased twofold when measured at acidification,
and concentrations were the same in the cheese product.22 Similar concentrations of DDT were reported
for whole milk and cheddar or Monterey cheese, indicating some net
loss of DDT, as total cheese mass would be less than the original
milk mass. No changes in DDT concentration were observed during storage.

Lipophilic compounds in this study concentrated in the curd to
a greater extent than whey, but the lipophilic pesticide lindane (log P = 3.99), a cyclo-chlorinated structure with similarities
to β-HBCD, did not concentrate in cheese or yogurt (produced
from curd) made from contaminated raw milk.23 The authors attributed the lack of concentration to heat treatment
during pasteurization which resulted in phenolic metabolite formation.
Pasteurization resulted in a 65–73% reduction in lindane, with
more losses during refrigeration of yogurt (1.4–8% over 3 days)
and cheeses (36.7% in Ras cheese during 6 months in storage). Although
the effects of pasteurization and storage were not investigated in
the current study, similar losses in β-HBCD might occur. Contrary
to Abou-Arab,23 Langlois et al.17 found that lindane concentration in curd (4.3
ppm) was approximately 12 times that measured in whey (0.34 ppm).
In a second study, Langlois et al.24 determined
that curd concentrations of endrin (log D and P = 4.9) were about eight times those in whole milk (5.48
vs 0.7 ppm), whereas whey concentration was only 0.06 ppm (curd/whey
concentration ratio = 91). Surprisingly, heptachlor (log P = 5.46), with higher lipophilicity than endrin, was present in whey
(0.17 ppm) at approximately 1/20 the concentration measured in curd
(3.77 ppm) (curd/whey concentration ratio = 22).24 Cruformate (log P = 3.33), which has a
log P similar to BPA (3.60) and E1 (3.62), had a
dose-dependent distribution. At a starting milk concentration of 0.07
ppm, cruformate was 22 times more concentrated in curd than that in
whey (0.43 vs 0.02 ppm, respectively), but with a starting milk concentration
of 0.16 ppm, the curd/whey concentration ratio was 31 (0.92 and 0.03
ppm, respectively) similar to that of BPA (29) and E1 (24).18

Hydrophilic compounds distributed more
evenly between curd and whey. For example, the curd/whey concentration
ratio for GLY (log D = −4.24) was 1.4 and
for IMI (log D = −0.38) was 2.4, similar to
SDMX (ratio 3.2), PENG (ratio 1.2), OTET (ratio 1.4), ERY (ratio 2.4),
and KETO (ratio 2.4) as previously reported.8 Given the diversity of chemical structures tested, the log D value of hydrophilic compounds does provide some predictive
measure for curd and whey distribution. Similarly, TAP and TYL possessed
fairly low curd/whey concentration ratios, that is, 1.3 and 1.5, respectively.9

Figure 4A (log D) and 4B (log P) shows the relationships between log D or log P values and log[0% moisture curd]/[whey]
concentration ratios, including 99% CI and prediction interval. By
combining the log[0% moisture curd]/[whey] data of the current set
with those of Shappell et al.8 and Lupton
et al.,9 the regression with log D had an r2 = 0.73, whereas
the log P regression had an r2 = 0.63 (Figure 4A,B). The higher regression coefficient obtained using log D data reinforces the previous conclusion that log D is a better predictor of the distribution between curd
and whey than log P.8,9 On the basis
of the 99% CIs for the log P regression, numerous
outliers were present when all 27 compounds were modeled. Outliers
for the curve fit on a log D basis (Figure 4A) included ASP, ERY, 2-OH-1378-TCDD,
TAP, and TBBPA compounds which distributed more toward whey than predicted.
Conversely, BPA, CIPR, E1, and PBZ distributed more toward curd than
predicted. In the log P model (Figure 4B), four additional chemicals (CLA, KETO,
FNX, and PENG) fell outside of the 99% CIs.

Chemical Distribution from
Whey into Retentate and Permeate
In order to assess the percent
of drug associated with the whey proteins, ultrafiltration in conjunction
with centrifugation was performed (phase 3, Figure 5). The expected volume of retentate was 33%
of the applied sample volume based on centrifugation time and speed,
with the actual measured mean for all compounds being 37 ± 3.3%.
Mean recovery of radioactivity across all compounds was 100 ±
4.5%. Mean nonspecific binding of compounds to filters ranged from
0.2% for GLY to 22.5% for E1. Compounds with >3% filter binding
include PCB-118 (6.4%), BDE-99 (7.1%), β-HBCD (8.2%), BPA (13.4%),
and E1 (22.5%) (Tables S29–S40).
Although compounds with high log D values could be
expected to be “sticky” in the aqueous medium, four
compounds with high log D values [TCC (log D = 5.39), 2-OH-1378-TCDD (log D = 6.15),
1278-TCDD (log D = 6.22), and TBBPA (log D = 6.69)] had filter binding of ≤2.4%.

partitioning processes that yielded cream and milk fat from whole
milk (phase 1) curd and whey from skim milk (phase 2) and retentate
and permeate from whey (phase 3).

The associations of the 12 xenobiotics with whey protein,
as determined by the percentage of compound measured in the retentate,
revealed three groupings (Figure 6). The first was represented by GLY and IMI that have
negative log D values (−4.24 and −0.38,
respectively), where there was essentially no association with the
whey protein (<5%) occurred (Tables S29 and S30). The second grouping was composed of BPA, E1, 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101, 2-OH-1378-TCDD, and 1278-TCDD, which had moderate
associations with whey protein, ranging from 33 to 76% (Tables S31–S33, S35, and S38). Similar
to our findings of ∼64% association of E1 with whey protein,
Wolford and Argoudelis25 reported 48 and
53% of 17β-estradiol and E1, respectively, associated with whey
protein. The third grouping was composed of those compounds that were
almost totally associated with retentate whey proteins (84–98%,
one outlier of 107% for PCB-118 due extremely low starting radiocarbon
in the whey). Chemicals in this grouping included BDE-99, β-HBCD,
PCB-118, TBBPA, and TCC (Tables S34, S36, S37, S39, and S40). If present in whey, these compounds would concentrate
in whey-derived protein products.

The percent of whole milk dose associated with
either casein or whey proteins is reported in Table 2. About 25% of TBBPA and 2-OH-1378-TCDD from
whole milk distributed to whey, yet ∼90 and 70% (TBBPA and
2-OH-1378-TCDD, respectively) of that were associated with whey protein.

Chemical Concentration
Based on Protein Mass for Casein and Whey Proteins
Using
0% moisture curd data from phase 2, the amount of chemical associated
with caseins was calculated based on proteins present in curd and
largely result from agglutination of casein (Table 2). Similarly, using phase 3 data, the amount
of chemical associated with whey proteins can be calculated (Table 2). Chemical saturation
of casein or whey protein was not observed because the mass of chemical
per milligram protein increased as the concentration increased. In
some instances, the initial expected fortification concentrations
in whole milk differed from measured concentrations, as seen with
3′-MeSO2-PCB-101 and β-HBCD. Whey protein
association values for the lowest dose of BDE-99 are questionable
because the starting skim milk contained <2 nM and whey 0.3 nM.
However, confidence in casein/whey protein association results is
enhanced by the agreement found across doses (Table 2), exception was BDE-99, where ratios ranged
from 2.8 to 5.5.

For the majority of chemicals tested (BDE-99,
BPA, E1, β-HBCD, IMI, 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101, PCB-118,
and 1278-TCDD), the association with caseins was greater than that
for whey proteins (ratio > 1, Table 2). The importance of methodology is evident when comparing
our findings to those of Wolford and Argoudelis25 that used equilibrium dialysis with E1 and the slightly
more hydrophilic compound E2. They reported that E1 and E2 were largely
(>84%) bound to protein when incubated in skim milk, and >50%
of the bound estrogens was associated with whey proteins. These data
are in contrast to our findings for E1, in which the association (nmol/mg
protein) ratio was approximately 2 for casein/whey. The difference
between the results of the two studies was most likely the precipitation
of curd caseins in the present work versus the presence of soluble
caseins used for dialysis by Wolford and Argoudelis25 (1979).

Other chemicals that preferentially associated
with caseins relative to whey protein (ratio > 1) include THIA
(2.5), IVR (2.0),8 TYL (1.4), CIPR (2.0),
and PZQ (1.5).9 Although the current work
used a majority of chemicals with log D greater than
3.4, our previous reports described only one such chemical (IVR).
The casein/whey protein association ratio of IVR was more similar
to BPA (2.0), E1 (1.9), and IMI (1.9) (Table 2).

In spite of higher distribution
of GLY into whey than curd (Figure 3), there was in fact very little preferential retention
of GLY associated with whey protein (Figure 6). Similarly, TCC, 2-OH-1378-TCDD, and TBBPA
also had casein/whey protein ratios <1. Although most of the total
TCC dose was partitioned with milk fat (mean 85%), the remainder distributed
almost equally between whey and 0% moisture curd (57% curd, Table S22). TCC remaining in the whey was concentrated
almost exclusively in the retentate (98%) during ultracentrifugation
(Table S34). The log D values of 2-OH-1378-TCDD (6.15) and TBBPA (6.69) did not predict
the respective mean casein/whey protein ratios of 0.26 and 0.33. Both
chemicals also distributed to a lesser extent than predicted into
milk fat. The common feature of both compounds is a hydroxyl moiety
between two halogens (chlorines for 2-OH-1378-TCDD and bromines for
TBBPA).

Previously studied chemicals that had higher association
for whey proteins versus caseins were PENG (casein/whey ratio = 0.2),
ERY (0.5), KETO (0.4), SDMX (0.8);8 TAP
(0.5), CLA (0.4), and FNX (0.25).9 Although
the distribution between lipid and aqueous phases was markedly dependent
on the property of proteins, namely lipophilicity, small-molecule
binding to proteins seems to be more dependent on specific functional
groups within the protein. Identifying the specific functional groups
and binding domains that can associate with studied chemicals within
a plethora of whey and casein proteins lies outside the scope of the
present research.

Relation to Consumer Products
To
determine how the distributions of these compounds, if detected in
whole milk, related to consumer products, the percent distributions
into milk fat, curd, retentate, and permeate were calculated in relation
to the starting concentration in whole milk. Figure 7 includes the experimentally derived percentages
of each compound in high-fat products which would include butter,
cream, and cheese; low-fat products would include skim milk, low fat
cheese, yogurt, and low-fat derived whey protein products such as
whey protein powders and baby formulas. Comparable to compounds previously
tested,8,9 higher log D compounds
(i.e., E1, 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101, TCC, PCB-118, β-HBCD,
1278-TCDD, and BDE-99) generally distributed to high-fat products
such as butter and cream. High-fat products that contain protein (i.e.,
cheese) will concentrate both mid- to high-range log D molecules such as BPA, 2-OH-1378-TCDD, and TBBPA along with the
higher log D compounds. Two compounds with low log D’s, that is, GLY and IMI, will primarily distribute
into aqueous products, such as skim milk and whey.

Figure 7 Normalized percentages
of chemicals calculated from whole milk to be in the milk end products
of milk fat, curd, permeate, and retentate based on data generated
from the current studies as well as those reported in Hakk et al.,7 Shappell et al.,8 and
Lupton et al.9 The PZQ bar has additional
information on which milk end products comprise whole milk, skim milk,
curd, low-fat curd, and whey, as a guide to where drug may partition
during commercial milk processing. For percentage of chemical associated
with whey protein see supplemental information tables S29−S40.

Determining where a compound would
concentrate in consumer products will also depend on the processing
steps involved and what specific end product is being manufactured.
For example, whole milk processed into skim milk and cream would generally
have compounds with high log D values concentrated
in butter and cream, whereas compounds with low log D values will be in skim milk. Compounds with mid-range log D values will be split between the higher fat products and
skim milk. However, if whole milk is processed directly into cheese,
then the mid-range and high-range log D value compounds
will mainly concentrate in the cheese.

Conclusions
The
partitioning of 12 environmental contaminants or metabolites into
milk fractions was assessed. Partitioning between milk fat and skim
milk and between 0% moisture curd and whey was usually governed by
the compound’s lipophilicity. If a chemical was found in whey,
the more nonpolar the compound the more likely it would be found in
whey protein products. Phenolic compounds were the main chemicals
that fell outside of the 99% CIs of the models’ regression
analyses. These models provide a tool using log D as the primary chemical property to predict the distribution of
chemicals into various milk products.

Experimental Section
Safety
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and USDA regulations were followed
for handling all radiolabeled chemicals.

Selection of Drugs and
Concentrations
Chemicals selected for study had to be potential
environmental contaminants, encompass a wide range of lipophilicities,
and be available with radiolabel (3H or 14C)
incorporation. The chemicals selected had a log P range of −3.3 to 7.3. Chemical structures, site of radiolabel,
specific activity (SA), and physio-chemical properties are provided
in Table 1.

To
detect potential concentration-dependent distribution, chemical concentrations
spanning 3 orders of magnitude (i.e., 20–2000 nM) were generally
used. The lowest concentration (usually 20 nM) was typically relevant
to possible contamination scenarios with sufficient activity to allow
radiochemical detection. Higher concentrations were used to determine
whether concentration influenced overall xenobiotic distribution.
In some instances, concentrations were adjusted because of limited
solubility or if the SA of the radiolabeled compound was inadequate
for the sensitivity of the analysis (Table 1). As a result of adding unlabeled chemical
(typically 9:1 parts) for the highest dose, SA was lowered, relative
to low concentration.

Chemicals, Supplies, and Equipments
Raw (unpasteurized, nonhomogenized) cow milk was obtained from the
bulk milk tank located at the North Dakota State University (Fargo,
ND) Dairy farm within 48 h of milking. Nonradiolabeled chemicals and
solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), U.S. Pharmacopeia
(Rockville, MD), or other common vendors. Radiolabeled E1, GLY, PCB-118,
and β-HBCD were procured through American Radiolabeled Chemicals,
Inc. (ARC, St. Louis, MO). A mixture of the β- and γ-diastereoisomers
of [14C]-HBCD was identified in the ARC product. Flash
chromatography on a silica gel column eluted with hexane containing
increasing amounts of methylene chloride (0–50%) was used to
isolate [14C]-β-HBCD. [14C]-BPA and [14C]-TCC were purchased from Moravek Inc. (Brea, CA). [14C]-IMI was a gift from Bayer Crop Science (Research Triangle
Park, NC). [UL-7,8-ring 14C]-1278-TCDD was purchased from
ChemSyn Science Laboratories (Lenexa, KS). [14C]-2,2′,4,4′,5-pentabromodiphenyl
ether (BDE-99) was synthesized using published methods.10 2-OH-1378-TCDD was prepared in-house from [UL-7,8-ring 14C]-1278-TCDD by in vitro oxidation with human CYP1A1R Baculosomes
(Cypex Ltd., Dundee, UK) and a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase regenerating
system according to manufacturer’s instructions. [14C]-2,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3,5-dibromophenyl)propane (TBBPA) was synthesized
by brominating bis[14C]-phenol A with 4.2 equivalents of
bromine in 1:1 methanol/water; bis[14C]-phenol A was prepared
in-house from [UL-14]-phenol (2.0 mCi,
25 mCi/mmol) and acetone according to a published method.11 3′-[14C]-MeSO2-PCB-101
was synthesized de novo by Cadogan coupling as described in Haraguchi
et al.12 using sodium [14C]-methyl
thiolate for label introduction.

Silica gel plates were purchased
from Analtech (Newark, DE). Scintillation cocktails were purchased
from MP Biochemicals, LLC, (Ecolite; Solon, OH) or PerkinElmer (Waltham,
MA; Carbosorb, and Permafluor). Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters
were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). An Allegra X-14R centrifuge
was obtained from Beckman-Coulter (Brea, CA). Liquid milk product
fractions were mixed with scintillation fluid and assayed using a
Tri-Carb 1900 liquid scintillation counter (LSC, Packard, Meriden,
CT). Solid milk product samples were combusted using a Packard model
307 tissue oxidizer (Meriden, CT), trapped into Carbosorb, diluted
with Permafluor, and then assayed by LSC. Sample purity was assessed
by TLC and radioassay using a Bioscan AR-2000 Imaging Scanner for
TLC (Washington, DC).

Determination of Chemical Purity and Confirmation
of Test Article Stability
TLC analyses were used to assess
chemical purities before and after the experiments, although for GLY,
high-performance liquid chromatography instead of TLC was employed.
Initial analyses were used to evaluate dose purity, whereas postincubation
analyses were used to evaluate whether chemical degradation occurred
during milk processing. TLC conditions and results are included in Table S3. GLY radiochemical purity (98.0 ±
0.4%, n = 4) was determined based on Nagatomi et
al.13 using a Waters 2695 HPLC, a radiometric
detector (Packard LFA 515TR, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA), and a Dionex
IonPac AS 12 column (4 × 200 mm, 9 μm, Dionex Company,
Sunnyvale, CA). The mobile phase was isocratic 0.2% aqueous formic
acid/acetonitrile (5/95 v/v), and the flow rate was 1 mL/min.

Milk Processing
and Radiochemical Analysis
The milk processing experiments
consisted of three sequential phases. Specific details pertaining
to preparation of phases are reported in Hakk et al.7 and Shappell et al.8 Briefly,
12 tubes of raw milk (50 mL) were pasteurized at 63 °C for 30
min. Triplicate tubes were fortified with each level of radiolabeled
chemicals using three working solutions or with the appropriate solvent
for blank milk, as described in Table 2. In phase 1, the fortified, pasteurized, whole milk
samples were separated into milk fat and skim milk by centrifugation
after equilibration; the partitioning of chemical between these phases
was then determined by radiochemical detection methods. In phase 2,
the skim milk originating from phase 1 was partitioned into curd and
whey (enzymatically with rennet) and the distribution of the target
chemical between these phases determined by radiochemical detection.
In phase 3, the residual whey (15 mL) from phase 2 was separated into
a protein-enriched fraction (>10 kD), retentate (∼5 mL)
and permeate (∼10 mL) fractions using ultracentrifuge filters.
To determine if degradation occurred during processing, milk fat,
curd, and whey from the highest dose concentration were extracted
and analyzed by TLC side by side with radiolabeled standards with
the exception of GLY because no satisfactory TLC method was found.
The main difference in the current study compared to the cited research7−9 was that here the radiolabeled compounds were fortified only once
into whole milk and not anew at the beginning of each phase (Figure 5), resulting in lower
initial chemical concentrations in skim and whey fractions.

Calculation
of Chemical Associated with Casein and Whey Protein
The percentage
of chemical associated with whey proteins was calculated according
to Shappell et al.8 Briefly, the amount
of free chemical measured in permeate (calculated by concentration
and volume) was subtracted from the total amount of chemical present
in retentate. The difference was assumed to be the amount of chemical
associated with whey protein. Residual radioactivity on ultrafilters
(measured by combustion analysis) was considered nonspecific binding
and was subtracted from the fortified whey results; however, radioactivity
present in filter washes was included with retentate radioactivity.
Averaged Kjeldahl protein concentrations in curd from Shappell et
al.8 and Lupton et al.9 and the resultant 0% moisture curd radioactivity (see below)
along with its SA were used to calculate nanomole per milligram casein
protein association. Similarly, averaged Kjeldahl protein concentration
in retentate from Shappell et al.8 and
Lupton et al.9 and the protein associated
radioactivity and its SA in retentate was used to calculate nanomole
per milligram whey protein association.

Statistical Analyses
Standard statistical methods were used to calculate means and variability
and make inferences with respect to the significance of differences
between means. Linear regression was used to assess dose dependence
of the observed drug distribution log ratio of [chemical]milk fat/[chemical]skim milk or 0% moisture [chemical]curd/[chemical]whey. Dose dependency was based on
instances when the slope differed (P < 0.05) from
zero. Because curd is 70% moisture and contains a small quantity of
entrained whey, a 0% moisture curd radioactivity value was calculated
by subtracting entrained whey-associated radioactivity (calculated
based on the percent moisture) from curd. The value representing entrained
whey was added back to the whey fraction.

Coefficient of variation
with respect to measured partition values across doses was typically
much less than 10%, whereas literature values for log P for a given chemical could sometimes differ by an order of magnitude
or greater. Therefore, distribution data were modeled using mean log P values ± SD for each chemical. Mean log P values were calculated from predicted and measured entries included
in Chemspider, DrugBank, ChemBL, and Pubchem databases. For 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101, the log P value was derived from
using conversion of chlorocyclohexatriene into p-chlorophenyl
methyl sulfone as a model, which has log differences of 1.76. By using
PCB-101 log P of 6.38 and subtracting 1.76, the log P of 3′-MeSO2-PCB-101 was derived as 4.62.
Log D values were calculated as described by Scherrer
and Howard14 using a pH of 6.8 (reflecting
the pH of milk); to obtain a theoretical range of log D values for each compound, the range of log P values
derived from the above sources was used in conjunction with the range
of pKa values obtained from the same sources;
log D values were averaged and SDs calculated. Relationships
between the log distribution ratios and lipophilicity (log D and log P) were performed using linear
function and included the 99% CI and prediction interval by GraphPad
Prism Version 7.03 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
