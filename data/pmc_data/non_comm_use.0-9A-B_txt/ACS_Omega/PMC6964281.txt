Herein, we report knitting of a thiophenyltriazine-based
porous
organic polymer (TTPOP) with high surface area and high abundance
of nitrogen and sulfur sites, synthesized through a simple one-step
Friedel–Crafts reaction of 2,4,6-tri(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine
and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal in the presence of anhydrous FeCl3, and thereafter grafting of Cu(OAc)2·H2O in the porous polymer framework to achieve the potential
catalyst (CuII-TTPOP). TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP
were characterized thoroughly utilizing solid-state 13C-CP
MAS NMR, Fourier transform infrared, wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction,
thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
surface imaging by transmission electron microscopy and field emission
scanning electron microscopy. The porosity of the nanomaterials was
observed in the surface imaging and verified through conducting N2 gas adsorption techniques. Keeping in mind the tremendous
importance of C-C and C-N coupling and cyclization processes, the
newly synthesized CuII-TTPOP was employed successfully
for a wide range of organic catalytic transformations under mild conditions
to afford directly valuable diindolylmethanes and spiro-analogues,
phthalimidines, propargyl amines, and their sugar-based chiral compounds
with high yields using readily available substrates. The highly stable
new heterogeneous catalyst showed outstanding sustainability, robustness,
simple separation, and recyclability.

Introduction
The porous organic polymers (POPs) are
attractive materials with
multipurpose applications in gas storage and separation,1−4 catalytic supports,5,6 chemical sensing,7 and energy storage,8 owing to
their larger surface area, low skeleton density, and high chemical
and thermal tolerance. The greatly enhanced surface area and porosity,
installation of functionality for binding substrates and metal ions,
and developing innovative chemical activities through the fabrication
of nanomaterials are the essential parameters for heterogeneous catalysis,
and controlling these parameters is a novel target to the research
professionals of academia and industry to achieve selective organic
transformations. During the last few decades, many works have been
focused on synthesis of various POPs, such as hyper-cross-linked polymers
(HCPs),9,10 polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs),11 conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs),12 crystalline triazine-based frameworks (CTFs),13 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),14,15 and covalent organic frameworks (COFs),16 in addition to the traditional porous materials, such as zeolites,17 porous amine-modified silicas,17 and activated porous carbons.18 Among these porous materials, the amorphous POPs are ideal host
matrices to encapsulate various active metal ions in heterogeneous
catalysis because of their unprecedented intrinsic structural features,
such as the availability of suitable binding sites in the polymer
frameworks comprising nonhydrolyzable carbon backbones, high surface
areas, porosities, and thermal and hydrothermal stabilities present
in the POP supports. These features render POPs potentially advantageous
over COFs and MOFs as a suitable platform for the development of new-generation
heterogeneous catalysts. Our main aims of designing and synthesizing
porous materials are to achieve remarkably enhanced porosities and
heightened surface areas, and these highly attractive properties are
expected to find innovative applications in nanoscience and nanotechnology
such as in absorption and storage of useable voluminous volatile materials,
electromagnetic wave absorption materials, asymmetric supercapacitors,
automotive exhaust purifiers, sensing lethal health hazards of varied
phases, fabricating nanoelectronic devices of unparalleled sensitivity,
and highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis for diverse organic syntheses.19 Herein, we successfully investigated synthesis,
fabrication, characterization, imaging, adsorption, and heterogeneous
catalysis of CuII-based nano-POPs.

Due to obvious
advantages, the heterogeneous catalysis has gained
much attention over homogeneous catalysis for most of the fundamental
reactions, such as cyclic carbonate formation, nucleophilic addition,
hetero-Diels–Alder and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, alkyne hydration,
rearrangement, oxidation, reduction, coupling reaction, photocatalysis,
C(sp3)–H borylation, and alkene hydroformylation.20 In general, the single-metal sites are incorporated
into polymers of heterogeneous catalysts, where the porosity makes
the active sites easily accessible and may lead to enhanced catalytic
selectivity based on which substrates can preferentially be reached
and smoothly react with the catalytic sites. Due to the inbuilt covalent-bonded
network, one could anticipate that POPs might become more suitable
scaffolds than the other porous materials to anchor metal ions and
therefore emerge as versatile and efficient organic supports as heterogeneous
catalysts. It also allows easy recovery of the occluded guests and
providing stabilization of the guest under reaction conditions. Due
to low cost, easy availability, and diverse catalytic activities under
different conditions, copper compounds have attracted much attention
in organic synthesis. Recently, Liu’s group synthesized a porous
organic polymer bifunctionalized with triazine and thiophene moieties
and employed for removal of Cu(II) ions from water through adsorption.21 Inspired by this work, we have synthesized,
fully characterized, and grafted the triazinothiophene-nano-POP with
Cu(II)-species for development of its innovative catalytic properties.
Gratifyingly, during the screening of fundamental C-C/C-N coupling
and cyclization catalysis, we found diverse catalytic activities of
the CuII-TTPOP for C-N and C-C coupled dual cyclization
under mild conditions to valuable diindolylmethane analogues (4, eq. i, Scheme 1), three-component coupling to highly substituted propargyl
amines (7, eq. ii), and three-partner annulation to phthalimidines
(9, eq. iii).

Scheme 1 CuII-TTPOP-Catalyzed C-C/C-N
Coupled Reactions
The diindolylmethanes contain an indole moiety,
and they could
serve as advanced intermediates for the synthesis of numerous bioactive
molecules.22−24 Recently, these heterocycles have been considered
as attractive synthetic targets possessing diverse biological properties
such as antibacterial,25 antifungal,26 antiandrogenic,27 anticancer,28 and anti-implantation activities.29 They are also known to act as growth-promoting
agents and carbonic anhydrase II inhibitors30 as well as dyes and colorimetric sensors.31 It should be noted that the classical method for the synthesis of
diindolylmethanes involved the Friedel–Craft reaction of indoles
and carbonyl compounds using homogeneous catalysis.32 The indolization of 2-ethynylanilines followed by functionalization
has been found as an alternative efficient route for achieving substituted
indoles using transition metal catalysts.33 Very recently, varieties of diindolylmethanes have been synthesized
via cycloisomerization of 2-alkynyl anilines followed by C3-functionalization
in one pot.32b To the best of our knowledge,
there is not a single report on the synthesis of diindolylmethanes
employing 2-ethynylaniline (a precursor of indole) by using a heterogeneous
catalyst. Most of the routes to diindolylmethanes were performed through
the electrophilic substitution reaction of indoles or their precursors
with carbonyl compounds using homogeneous catalysis.32 On the other hand, propargyl amines were also synthesized
previously employing Cu-, Ag-, Zn-, and Ru-salts and complexes as
homogeneous catalysts.34 For instance,
synthesis of propargyl amines was established through one-pot three-component
reactions among aldehydes, amines, and alkynes (A3-coupling)
using homogeneous catalysts such as CuPF6-i-Pr-pybox-diPh,34a CuO nanoparticles,34b Cu(OTf)2,34c RuCl3-CuCl,34f and Ag(IPr)2]PF6.34h Apart from
this, the use of AgOAc catalyst to couple terminal alkynes,34e ZnEt2 carboxylic acid promoter,34g and Zn(OTf)234i for the reaction among terminal alkynes and imines at high
temperature was reported. Phthalimidines are important heterocyclic
scaffolds from a synthetic prospect and are found widely in complex
natural products35 and drug molecules.36 They have become attractive synthetic objects
owing to their broad range of biological profile, such as antipsychotic,37 antiulcer,38 antiviral,39 anesthetic,40 antihypertensive,41 anti-inflammatory,42 antileukemic,43 and vasodilatory44 activities. Due to the broad spectrum of the
biological profile of substituted phthalimidines, their synthesis
is very much important. Although aldimines have been extensively studied
for their synthesis,45 there is not a single
report on the synthesis of these heterocycles employing a heterogeneous
catalyst.

Herein, we have synthesized a thiophenyltriazine-based
porous organic
polymer (TTPOP) through the Friedel–Crafts reaction of 2,4,6-tri(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine
and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal in the presence of anhydrous FeCl3 and thereafter grafting of Cu(OAc)2·H2O in the porous polymer framework to achieve the potential
catalyst CuII-TTPOP. TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP were
characterized thoroughly by employing the following techniques: wide-angle
powder XRD, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission (FE)
SEM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared,
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, solid-state cross-polarization
magic angle spinning 13C NMR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The newly synthesized CuII-TTPOP was employed successfully
for a wide range of organic catalytic transformations under mild conditions
to afford directly valuable diindolylmethanes and spiro-analogues,
phthalimidines, propargyl amines, and their sugar-based chiral compounds
with high yields and high recyclability using readily available substrates.
To the best of our knowledge, the heterogeneous catalysis was never
attempted before the contribution of this study to synthesize the
unique classes of valuable diindolylmethanes and spiro-analogues,
phthalimidines, and propargyl amines.

Experimental Section
Materials and Characterization Techniques
2-Thiophenecarbonitrile
and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
India. Ethylene dichloride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid were
purchased from Spectrochem, India. Anhydrous ferric chloride was obtained
from Merck, India. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded
on a desktop X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-Miniflex II) with Cu Kα
(λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of polymer materials were obtained using Micromeritics ASAP
2020 at 77 K. Prior to the gas adsorption studies, the samples were
degassed at 403 K under high vacuum conditions for 8 h. Specific surface
areas were calculated from the adsorption data using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) methods. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the
polymer samples were taken using a Tecnai G2 F20 instrument.
A Jeol JEM 6700F field emission scanning electron microscope was used
for the determination of the morphology of the polymers. Thermogravimetric
analysis of the polymers was carried out on Netzsch STA 449 C coupled
with Netzsch QMS 403 C under a continuous flow of air with a heating/cooling
rate of 10 °C min–1. The solid-state MAS NMR
spectra of the samples were taken in a Bruker Ascend 400 spectrometer.
Cu loading in the sample was estimated using a PerkinElmer Optima
2100 DV inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscope (ICP-MS). X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out by a SPECS
I3500 plus spectrometer using a Mg X-ray source. Unless otherwise
stated, reactions were performed in oven-dried glassware fitted with
rubber septa and were stirred with Teflon-coated magnetic stirring
bars. Liquid reagents and solvents were transferred via a syringe
using standard Schlenk techniques. Acetonitrile, dichloromethane (DCM),
and 1,2-ethylene dichloride (EDC) were distilled over calcium hydride.
All other solvents and reagents were used as received unless otherwise
noted. Reaction temperatures above 25 °C refer to the oil bath
temperature. Thin layer chromatography was performed using silica
gel 60 F-254 precoated plates (0.25 mm) and visualized by UV irradiation,
anisaldehyde stain, and other stains. Silica gel of particle size
100–200 mesh was used for column chromatography. Melting points
were recorded on a digital melting point apparatus from Jyoti Scientific
(AN ISO 9001:2000) and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 300/400 MHz spectrometer with 13C operating frequencies of 75/100 MHz. Chemical shifts (δ)
are reported in ppm relative to the residual solvent CDCl3 signal (δ = 7.24 for 1H NMR and δ = 77.0
for 13C NMR) and DMSO-d6 signal
(δ = 2.47 for 1H NMR and δ = 39.4–40.6
for 13C NMR). Data for 1H NMR spectra are reported
as follows: chemical shift (multiplicity, number of hydrogen and coupling
constants). Abbreviations are as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). High-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) data was recorded on a Q-tof-micro quadruple
mass spectrophotometer using acetonitrile as solvent.

Synthesis of 2,4,6-Tri(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine
To a stirred solution of 2-thiophenecarbonitrile (A) (1.0915 g, 10
mmol) in 25 mL of dry dichloromethane was added trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid (1.501 g, 10 mmol) under ice-cool conditions. The mixture was
stirred for 36 h at room temperature under an Ar atmosphere. After
the removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was
neutralized with aqueous NaHCO3. The formed precipitate
was collected by filtration; then washed with water, methanol, acetone,
and hexane in this order; and dried under vacuum to afford 2,4,6-tri(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine
with 85% yield.

Synthesis of Thiophenyltriazine-Based Porous Organic Polymer
The monomer 2,4,6-tri(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (1 mmol, 0.32
g) and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal (6 mmol, 0.53 mL) were dissolved
in anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE, 20 mL) in a 50 mL round-bottom
flask for 10 min. To this solution, anhydrous ferric chloride (8 mmol,
1.3 g) was added under an argon atmosphere. The resulting reaction
mixture was heated to 80 °C for 24 h under constant stirring.
After cooling to room temperature, the crude product was collected
by filtration and repeatedly washed with methanol until the filtrate
was nearly colorless. The product was further purified by Soxhlet
extraction in methanol for 24 h. Finally, the product was dried at
120 °C under vacuum to provide TTPOP, a brown solid, in a good
yield of ∼96% (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of CuII-TTPOP
Grafting of Cu(II) Ions in the Interior Cavities of the TTPOP
In a typical synthetic procedure, 100 mg of TTPOP in methanol (10
mL) was sonicated for 15 min. Then, Cu(OAc)2·H2O (90 mg) was added and again sonicated for 15 min. Then,
it was refluxed for 24 h, filtered, washed with methanol and acetone
till the filtrate became colorless, and dried at 80 °C for overnight
to obtain our CuII-TTPOP catalyst (1) (Scheme 2).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Diindolylmethanes
To a well-stirred solution of carbonyl compounds 2 (0.5
mmol) and 2-alkynyl anilines 3 (1.0 mmol) in chloroform
was added the CuII-TTPOP (containing 5 mol % Cu), and the
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4–8 h.
After complete consumption of the starting material (as indicated
by TLC), the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with chloroform
two times. Then, the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure
to get a crude residue, which was further purified by silica gel column
chromatography using 100–200 mesh silica gel to get pure DIMs 4 with 80–90% yields.

General Procedure for Synthesis of Propargyl Amines
To a well-stirred solution of aromatic aldehydes 2 (0.5 mmol) and aromatic amines 5 (0.525 mmol)
in chloroform was added CuII-TTPOP (containing 5 mol %
Cu), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for
2 h. After 2 h, phenyl acetylenes 6 (0.55 mmol) were
added dropwise into the reaction mixture and then the reaction mixture
was further stirred at room temperature for an additional 8–10
h. After completion of the reaction (as indicated by TLC), the reaction
mixture was filtered and washed with chloroform twice and the organic
layer was dried under reduced pressure to get a residue. The residue
was purified by silica gel column chromatography over 100–200
mesh silica gel to get pure propargyl amines 7 with high
yield (85–90%).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Phthalimidines
To a well-stirred solution of 2-formyl methyl benzoates 8 (0.5 mmol) and aromatic amines 5 (0.525 mmol) in chloroform
was added CuII-TTPOP (containing 5 mol % Cu), and the reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. After 2 h, phenylacetylene 6a (0.55 mmol) was added dropwise into the reaction mixture,
and the reaction mixture was further stirred at room temperature for
additional 20–22 h. After completion of the reaction (as indicated
by TLC), the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with chloroform
twice and the organic layer was dried under reduced pressure to get
a residue. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography
over 100–200 mesh silica gel to get pure phthalimidines 9 with 83–86% yields.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of CuII-TTPOP
The reaction sequences
toward synthesizing the CuII-TTPOP involve the treatment
of 2-thiophenecarbonitrile with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H) in dichloromethane (DCM) followed by heating
with formaldehyde dimethyl acetal [CH2(OMe)2] in the presence of anhydrous FeCl3 catalyst in 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE) to afford the polymer TTPOP. Finally, it was grafted with Cu(II)
ions utilizing copper acetate monohydrate salt [Cu(OAc)2·H2O] under refluxing methanol to obtain the desired
catalyst, CuII-TTPOP (Scheme 2).

Imaging TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP Materials
The
fibrous networks for both the TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP catalyst
are clearly observed through field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) imaging of the samples prepared by the drop cast method (Figure 1). From field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images, the width of the fibers
of TTPOP was in the range of 20–35 nm (Figure 1a and inset Figure 1b). Gratifyingly, on grafting of Cu(II) to
TTPOP, the porous and fibrous network is retained in the nano-range.
However, due to the incorporation of Cu(OAc)2·H2O in the binding sites of TTPOP, a small increase in the width
of the fibers was observed (Figure 1c) ranging 35–45 nm (inset Figure 1d). The FESEM image of CuII-TTPOP (inset Figure 1d) clearly shows that good crystallinity arises after Cu(II)
grafting to TTPOP. It is also confirmed by the TEM image analyses
of the TTPOP (Figure 2a), which exhibits formation of bundles of ultralong nanofibrils.
The width of these fibers is in the range of 20–30 nm. Imaging
of the bundles of CuII-TTPOP nanofibrils had established
the existence of an excellent crystalline morphology.

(a, b) and CuII-TTPOP(c, d).

Figure 2 TEM images of TTPOP (a) and CuII-TTPOP (b);
their thermogravimetric
analysis (c) and wide-angle powder XRD (d).

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermogravimetric analyses
of TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP nanomaterials have been carried
out to understand the thermal stability of these materials (Figure 2c). The black line
of metal-free TTPOP indicates that the polymer is thermally stable
up to 350 °C and a minimum weight loss of 11% had taken place
due to the removal of adsorbed water or trapped solvents at the porous
networks.46 The major weight loss started
from 350 °C temperature, whereas weight loss started for CuII-TTPOP (red line) much earlier (300 °C). Thus, with
a rise in temperature, the polymer might start a sharp decomposition
due to thermal cleavage of C-C, C-N, and C-S bonds. On the other hand,
the TGA plot of CuII-TTPOP shows that above 300 °C
temperature, the sharp weight loss occurred due to the burning of
the organic framework.

Wide-Angle Powder X-ray Diffraction
The wide-angle
powder XRD pattern (Figure 2d) of TTPOP shows a single broad peak in the range of 15–30°,
indicating the amorphous nature of the hyper-cross-linked polymer.
However, after Cu(II) grafting in the polymer, it reveals some distinct
sharp peaks along with a broad peak.

FTIR Study
The presence of triazine and thiophene aromatic
residues is confirmed by recording FTIR spectra of both the polymer-based
TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP nanomaterials (Figure 3). The spectrum of TTPOP showed two adsorption
bands at 1507 and 1399 cm–1, which represent the
aromatic C-N stretching and “breathing” modes in the
triazine units, respectively.47 The adsorption
bands at 1660 cm–1 (C=C bond stretching) and 820
cm–1 (C-S bond stretching) confirm the presence
of a thiophene residue in the nanofibril polymer networks. From the
spectra (Figure 3)
of CuII-TTPOP and reused CuII-TTPOP, we have
seen the small positive shift of adsorption bands of the aromatic
C-N stretching and “breathing” modes in the triazine
units and C-S bond stretching in CuII-TTPOP and reused
CuII-TTPOP to the higher value. These results indicate
the coordination of Cu(II) ions by N and S binding sites in the polymer
frameworks.

after six consecutive cycles.

N2 Adsorption–Desorption Isotherm
The porosity of polymer-based TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP nanomaterials
is investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption analysis
at 77 K (Figure 4a,b).
The nitrogen sorption isotherms of both TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP
nanomaterials exhibit a rapid uptake below the relative pressure at P/Po = 0.1, which suggests the
presence of microporosity inside the polymers. The sorption profiles
show a typical type I isotherm, which is the characteristic of microporous
materials. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
areas of TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP are 466 and 395 m2 g–1, respectively. The existence of a hysteresis
loop in the high-pressure region in the isotherms could be attributed
to the presence of an interparticle void space or originating because
of deformation and swelling of the polymeric network upon gas adsorption.48 The pore size distributions (PSDs) of the nanomaterials
are calculated employing the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT)
method, which is shown in the inset of the corresponding figures.
The pore size distribution of the TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP
nanofibrils using the carbon slit-pore model at 77 K exhibited unimodal
porosity with extra-large micropores centered at 1.55 and 1.50 nm,
respectively, which signifies the presence of supermicropores in these
polymer-based materials.

Filled circles represent adsorption, and empty circles represent desorption
points. (c) Solid-state 13C-CP MAS NMR of TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP.

Solid-State 13C-CP MAS NMR
The structural
integrity of these porous materials, TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP,
is established from solid-state 13C-CP MAS NMR (Figure 4c). The signal at
14 ppm can be attributed to CH3 of acetates and at 28 ppm to the carbon (CH2) that is connected with two aromatic thiophene residues.
The signals at 58 and 68 ppm can be assigned to a few free methoxy
groups and methoxy groups bearing terminal carbon, respectively. The
signal at 138 ppm can be assigned to aromatic carbons of the thiophene
ring, and the signal at 168 ppm is attributed to the most deshielded
carbon atoms of the triazine ring.

ICP-MS and XPS Analyses
The Cu content in CuII-TTPOP was 2.76 wt % as determined by the ICP-MS analysis technique.
Further, the presence of copper in CuII-TTPOP has also
been confirmed by the Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 5c). The XPS measurement was employed to elucidate
the oxidation state of copper and to show the coordination of copper
ions by N and S binding sites of the polymer. XPS survey spectra (Figure 5d) of CuII-TTPOP demonstrate that in addition to the binding energy peaks at
532.05, 398.90, 283.98, 227.74, 164.85, and 163.85 eV corresponding
to the O 1s, N 1s, C 1s, S 2s, S 2p1/2, and S 2p3/2 respectively, there are another two peaks at 953.75 and 933.80 eV
that are attributed to the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 binding energies, respectively. The binding energy peak of N 1s
(shown in Figure 5a)
centered at 398.5 eV signifies the presence of free N sites of the
triazine moieties in the pure TTPOP. However, the positive shift of
the binding energy for N 1s to a higher value centered at 398.9 eV
and also the positive shift of binding energies for both S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 (shown in Figure 5b) to the higher values in the CuII-TTPOP indicate that here copper(II) ions are strongly coordinated
by both N and S binding sites of the triazine moieties in CuII-TTPOP. The XPS spectrum of Cu 2p indicates the +2 oxidation state
of Cu in the CuII-TTPOP material.49 During comparison of the XPS spectra of Cu 2p of CuII-TTPOP and Cu(OAc)2·H2O,49c we have seen a negative shift of binding energies of Cu
2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 to a lower value. This may
be due to the shifting of electron density from N and S sites to Cu(II)
ions in the CuII-TTPOP. These can be attributed to the
strong interaction between the polymer network and Cu(II) ions in
the CuII-TTPOP material.

TTPOP and CuII-TTPOP; (c) Cu 2p; and (d) survey of CuII-TTPOP.

Heterogeneous Nanocatalysis for Direct Construction of Valuable
Diindolylmethanes
In the present study, we have chosen a
model C-C/C-N coupled cyclization reaction for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes
employing unprotected 2-ethynyl anilines and aldehydes. At the very
outset, we started our initial development of the cascade reaction
through screening different catalysts to ultimately finding out the
most efficient catalytic system. The reaction of benzaldehyde (2a) and 2-ethynylaniline (3a) in the presence
of the metal-free TTPOP nanomaterial in ethylene dichloride (EDC)
at room temperature could not afford the desired diindolylmethane
(4a, entry 1, Table 1) and even at elevated temperature (80 °C). To
our delight, the reaction was completed in 4 h at 80 °C on employing
CuII-TTPOP as the catalyst (5 mol %), and the desired product 4a was obtained with 78% yield (entry 3). The reaction was
studied at ambient temperature using EDC, CH2Cl2, and CHCl3 (entries 4–6), and the yield was improved
to 90% in CHCl3 with a little slower reaction rate (6 h).
However, attempts with other polymer-based CuII catalysts
such as Cu(II)@SiO2, Cu(II)@C, and Cu(II)@polystyrene to
furnish 4a were successful with moderate yields (51–56%)
and relatively slower reaction rate (12 h, entries 7–9). Next,
we screened the solvent effect on the reaction with aprotic polar
(entries 10–14) and nonpolar solvents (entries 15 and 16),
and, unfortunately, these were not compatible with the cascade cyclization
process. Catalyst loading for the reaction was optimized to 5 mol
% (entries 6, 17, and 18).

Having optimized conditions in hand (entry 6, Table 1), we explored the
scope of
the reaction with a wide range of functionalized substrates (Scheme 3). The cascade cyclization
reaction was successfully investigated utilizing various aryl-, naphthyl-,
and heteroaromatic aldehydes as well as cyclic ketones under the developed
reaction conditions. Interestingly, the functionalized aromatic aldehydes
(2b–d) worked efficiently in this electrophilic
substitution reaction, affording the diindolylmethane (4b–d) in excellent yields (87–90%). Thiophenyl aldehyde 2e and a cyclic ketone 2f also served as good
substrates in this protocol and afforded the desired products 4e and 4f with 85 and 80% yields, respectively.
We also explored the scope of the reaction employing 4-nitro benzaldehyde
(2b) and a variety of 2-alkynyl anilines (3b–f) having aromatic as well as aliphatic groups at the alkyne end under
the optimized condition to obtain corresponding diindolylmethanes 4g–k with 80–90% yield. Later on, the cycloisomerization
followed by C3-functionalization reaction was also carried out with
differently substituted 2-alkynyl anilines (3g–k) and 4-nitro benzaldehyde (2b) under the standard conditions
(entry 7, Table 1).
Gratifyingly, substituted 2-(phenylethynyl) anilines 3g–k containing Cl, Br, CH3, and CF3 functionality
on the aromatic ring of 2-iodoaniline also served as good substrates,
leading to the formation of 4l–p (Scheme 3). The structures of the diindolylmethanes
(4a–p) were unambiguously established by comparing
the NMR data with reported compounds.32 One of our main aims to develop the strategies under mild conditions
is building of valuable sugar-based chiral compounds decorated with
multiple chiral centers. To our delight, the carbohydrate aldehydes 2g and 2h efficiently served as good substrates
to achieve corresponding chiral diindolylmethanes 4q and 4r.

Scheme 3 Synthesized Diindolylmethanes
Dual Role of Nanocatalyst
With the aim of gaining some
insight into the reaction mechanism, we performed some control experiments
(Scheme 4) in which
we monitored the reaction employing a mixture of 4-nitro benzaldehyde
(2b) and 2-ethynylaniline (3a) or 2b and indole (8) in the absence and presence
of our nanocatalyst (CuII-TTPOP) at room temperature in
CHCl3 (Scheme 4). It was noticed that compound 4b was not formed
at all in the absence of the catalyst even after 24 h (path a and
path b); rather, only the starting materials (2b, 3a, and 8) were recovered solely. However, as
expected, in the presence of catalyst (1), the diindolylmethane
(4b) was formed with 89–90% yield (paths c and
d). On the other hand, on continuing the reaction up to 2 h, indole
(8) was isolated in a significant amount (40%) along
with the desired product 4b (40%) (path e). The aforementioned
results clearly suggested that the reaction proceeds through indole 8 and the catalyst might have a dual role for activating both
the carbonyl and alkyne moieties.

Role of CuII-TTPOP
Synthesis of Propargyl Amine and Phthalimidine Synthon
To explore the diverse applicability of the nanocatalyst CuII-TTPOP, we examined its catalytic activities for the synthesis of
substituted propargyl amines and phthalimidines via multicomponent
reactions (MCR).50 Owing to their broad
spectrum of biological and pharmacological profiles,51−53 the syntheses of substituted propargyl amines became an active research
area.32 They have also been considered
as important chemical building blocks, particularly for the synthesis
of nitrogen-containing compounds, such as allylamines, pyrroles, pyrrolidines,
and oxazoles.54 The most commonly used
approach for the synthesis of propargyl amines is the A3-coupling under catalytic conditions utilizing aldehydes, amines,
and alkynes.34a Other important strategies
involved the amination of propargyl derivatives including propargyl
phosphates, esters, halides, triflates, and oxyphosphonium salts.55 Most of the methods to synthesize propargyl
amines have been performed under homogeneous catalysis only. Therefore,
the synthesis of propargyl amines employing heterogeneous catalysis
is highly desirable because it offers several advantages over homogeneous
catalysis. Keeping this goal in our mind, we were first intended to
synthesize propargyl amine, and our development of the A3-coupling reaction among 4-chloro benzaldehyde (2g),
4-methoxyphenylamine (5a), and phenylacetylene (6a) was investigated at room temperature and the desired product N-(1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-ynyl)-4-methoxyaniline
(7a) was not formed at all in the presence of TTPOP even
at elevated temperature in chloroform (entries 1 and 2; Table 2). To our delight, the desired
propargyl amine (7a) was isolated with 45–90%
yields in chloroform in the presence of CuII-TTPOP, Cu(II)@SiO2, Cu(II)@C, and Cu(II)@polystyrene (entries 3–6). Next,
we turned our attention toward the solvent study for the A3-coupling reaction (entries 7–17), which showed CHCl3 as the best reaction medium to afford propargyl amine 7a with 90% yield (entry 3). The catalyst loading was optimized to
5 mol % (entries 5, 18, and 19) under the reaction conditions. We
explored the scope of the A3-coupling reaction (Scheme 5) under optimized
reaction conditions (entry 3, Table 2), and corresponding functionalized propargyl amines
(7b–f) were furnished with synthetically viable
yields (85–90%). After getting success in the synthesis of
electronically different propargyl amines (7a–f), we were further interested to extend the A3-coupling
strategy for the direct synthesis of phthalimidines employing the
nanocatalyst CuII-TTPOP. At this end, we envisioned the
alkynylation followed by the Mannich lactamization reaction in the
presence of the heterogeneous catalyst. Gratifyingly, the new A3-coupling reaction among methyl benzoate-2-carboxaldehyde
(8), aromatic amines (5), and alkynes (6) afforded the desired phthalimidines (9a–d, Scheme 6) with high
yield (83–85%) under the mild conditions.

Recyclability and Heterogeneous Nature of the Catalyst CuII-TTPOP
For a heterogeneous catalyst, it is important
to examine its ease of separation from the reaction mixture, recoverability,
and reusability. The reusability of the CuII-TTPOP catalyst
was investigated for the synthesis of diindolylmethane (4a) from benzaldehyde (2a) and 2-ethynylaniline (3a) under optimized reaction conditions (entry 6, Table 1). After the first
catalytic cycle, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation of the
reaction mixture, subsequently washing with methanol followed by acetone,
and drying at 100 °C temperature for 1 h before its use in the
next cycle. The performance of the recovered catalyst for the representative
reaction was examined up to a six successive runs with a very low
loss of catalytic activity. The yield was 88% for the particular reaction
at the sixth run (Figure 6). The same technique was employed for the synthesis of propargyl
amine (7a, Table 2) and phthalimidines (9a, Scheme 6) under the optimized reaction conditions.
The low loss of catalytic activity may be due to the blocking of some
active sites with organic reagents during the course of a catalytic
reaction. To explain this, we have carried out N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm studies of the reused catalyst after the 6th cycle (Figure 7a). The decrease
in BET surface area (395–348 m2 g–1) led us to explain the fact that the accumulation of external materials
hinders N2 adsorption in pore space (reduction of pore
volume from 0.432 to 0.368 cm3/g).

CuII-TTPOP heterogeneous catalyst.

Figure 7 (a) N2 sorption, (b) FESEM image, (c) 13C-CP
MAS NMR, and (d) Cu 2p XPS spectrum of the reused CuII-TTPOP
catalyst after the 6th catalytic cycle. Herein, all of the characterizations
of reused catalyst were performed after the 6th catalytic cycle of
the reaction to diindolylmethane (4a), synthesized from
benzaldehyde (2a) and 2-ethynylaniline (3a) under optimized reaction conditions (entry 6, Table 1).

To check mechanical stability of the CuII-TTPOP nanocatalyst
after the 6th catalytic cycle, we have characterized the reused CuII-TTPOP nanocatalyst. SEM image analysis of the CuII-TTPOP nanocatalyst (Figure 7b) after the 6th catalytic run indicates that there is no
change in the morphology of the catalyst during the course of the
catalytic run. 13C solid-state CP MAS NMR analysis (Figure 7c) reveals that the
structural integrity of organic functional groups in the nanoporous
polymer backbone was retained. XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p region (Figure 7d) of reused CuII-TTPOP nanocatalyst signifies that the +2 oxidation state
of Cu remains unchanged after the catalytic reaction. All of these
analyses show that our newly developed nanocatalyst is stable with
the preservation of the structural integrity of organic functional
groups in the porous polymer backbone under the proposed aforesaid
reaction conditions. To determine whether the synthesis of diindolylmethane
analogues (4) with the CuII-TTPOP catalyst is indeed heterogeneous
in nature, we have performed the leaching test (Experimental
Section) by considering benzaldehyde and 2-ethynylaniline as
the model substrates under optimized reaction conditions. After 2
h, 55% conversion was attained. The reaction was continued for an
additional 4 h with the filtrate only after separating the CuII-TTPOP catalyst by centrifugation. However, no progress in
conversion was observed. The atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)
technique was employed to verify whether any leaching of copper takes
place during the course of catalytic reaction. The result indicates
that the Cu content in the filtrate was below the detection limit
of the instrument. The Cu content in the CuII-TTPOP catalyst
after the 6th catalytic cycle was found to be 2.73 wt %, as determined
by ICP-MS analysis, which is still analogous to that of the fresh
one (2.76 wt %). This study clearly established that almost no Cu
leaching occurred during the course of reactions and that our catalyst
is truly heterogeneous in nature.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized, fabricated,
and fully characterized
CuII-grafted 2,4,6-tri(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-based
nanofibrils with a microporous organic polymer network. The existence
of porosity in the nanomaterials was confirmed through SEM imaging
and the N2 adsorption study. The new CuII-TTPOP
porous nanomaterials were employed successfully for a wide range of
catalytic C-C/C-N coupling and cyclization under mild conditions to
afford valuable propargyl amines, phthalimidines, diindolylmethanes,
and spiro- and sugar-based chiral analogues. The heterogeneous and
porous nanocatalyst showed excellent sustainability, robustness, recoverability,
recyclability, simple separation, and negligible leaching of Cu(II).
This is an important addition to the existing homogeneous catalytic
methods and opens up a new avenue in heterogeneous catalysis.
