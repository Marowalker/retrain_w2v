To
improve intraocular transparency of collagen matrices, hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose (HPMC) was introduced for the first time into cross-linked
collagen to form collagen–HPMC composite membranes. Light transmittance
and refractive indices of the membranes are enhanced by incorporation
of HPMC in comparison to the control of cross-linked collagen membranes.
Maximum light transmittance of the collagen–HPMC membrane was
up to 92%. In addition, their permeability of nutrients such as glucose,
tryptophan, and NaCl was superior or comparable to that of human corneas.
In vitro results demonstrated that the collagen–HPMC membrane
supported adhesion and proliferation of human corneal epithelial cells
(HCECs), showing good cytocompatibility to HCECs. The corneas maintained
a smooth surface and clear stroma postoperatively after 7 months of
implantation of collagen–HPMC membranes into the corneas of
rabbits. The good intraocular biocompatibility was verified by maintaining
a high optical clarity for over 6 months after transplantation. Hematoxylin
and eosin staining results showed the growth of stromal keratocytes
into the collagen–HPMC implants, indicating the ability of
the collagen–HPMC membrane to induce corneal cell regeneration.
Taken together, the collagen–HPMC membrane might be a promising
candidate for use in corneal repair and regeneration.

1 Introduction
Corneal damage or disease
is the second leading cause of blindness
worldwide. According to WHO, there is an estimate of 36 million blind
people globally, and 217 million people have suffered from impaired
vision.1 More than 5% of these patients
are left blind because of corneal diseases.2 Transplantation with cornea donors is the only available treatment
currently. Because of the lack of human donor corneas, however, there
are only 40 000 patients receiving corneal transplantation
each year in the United States.3 The situation
would be worse in the developing countries. The increasing demand
of high-quality corneal tissues as well as the shortage of donor corneas
has raised a concern to develop corneal substitutes. In the field
of corneal substitute development, many strides have been made by
developing keratoprosthesis. A variety of keratoprostheses are now
in clinical use or trials.4−8 However, because of the existing problems of keratoprosthesis, such
as retroprosthetic membrane formation, corneal melting, optic deposition,
extrusion, and retinal detachment, none of them is widely accepted.9 On the other hand, Griffith et al.9 suggested that an ideal corneal substitute, from
a regenerative medicine field, should be biodegradable and should
promote postoperative endogenous host tissue reconstruction. Complications
of keratoprosthesis and donor cornea rejection are expected to be
conquered by this regenerative cornea. Therefore, a biodegradable
and biocompatible material, which could induce corneal tissue regeneration,
for example, corneal cells and nerves, is more desirable for use in
corneal reconstruction.

Collagen is the predominant extracellular
matrix (ECM) component
of the cornea.10 ECM provides templates
on the organogenesis process and also serves as a reconstruction template
during wound healing.11 Therefore, collagen
is one of the excellent candidates for corneal repair and regeneration.
Collagen possesses various desirable features as the ECM component
of the cornea. It exhibits biodegradability, low antigenicity, and
excellent biocompatibility because of weak toxicity and low immunoreaction.12−14 It also has the ability to induce normal tissue regeneration.10 Because of these excellent characteristics,
collagen is widely used in ophthalmology as suture material, bandage
lenses, punctual plugs, or viscous solutions during surgery.15 One of the most important ophthalmic applications
of collagen is the grafts for corneal reconstruction.

Many strides
have been made in the use of collagen-based matrices
for corneal regeneration in recent years, and encouraging results
were achieved. Previous studies conducted by Griffith et al. have
shown that cross-linked collagen patches produced from porcine or
bovine collagen promoted corneal cell and nerve regeneration in the
rabbit and pig models.16−18 These patches also demonstrated good biocompatibility.16−18 Another collagen 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine hydrogel
produced by Liu et al.19 could induce corneal
cell and nerve in-growth in vitro. This collagen-based hydrogel also
promoted the regeneration of the corneal epithelium and stroma in
the corneas of mini-pigs. What is more, allowing nerve regeneration
in vivo with the aid of these complexes is an important step toward
the way of successful corneal reconstruction. However, all these matrices
had opacity problems when implanted in corneas. That is, these collagen
or collagen-based matrices remained opaque or hazy in corneas at least
for several weeks after transplantation and did not restore full transparency
until 3–6 months after implantation.16,17,19,20 Apart from
tissue reconstruction, visual function is our goal to fulfill while
implanting corneal patches or substitutes into the corneas of patients.
A patient’s visual function can be restored right after transplantation,
instead of waiting for 6–12 months, which is highly desired
by patients. Therefore, we aim to develop corneal scaffolds that can
maintain high transparency in vivo during the process of promoting
the regeneration of corneal tissues.

Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
(HPMC) is a semisynthetic, biodegradable
cellulose derivative, which is widely used in a broad range of applications,
for example, as thickeners, water binders, film-forming agents, surfactants,21 and in the fields of pharmaceuticals22−25 and foods.26,27 HPMC has shown good biocompatibility
and nontoxicity to the human body. Trojani et al.28 reported the silated HPMC-based hydrogel used for three-dimensional
culture of osteogenic cells. It was able to support osteoblastic survival,
proliferation, and differentiation, representing a potential tissue
engineering basis for bone repair. Moreover, HPMC has already had
its applications in ophthalmology. As a bioadhesive polymer, for example,
HPMC has been used as ophthalmic viscosurgical devices during cataract
surgery.28,29 The abovementioned studies have demonstrated
the intraocular biocompatibility of HPMC and its potential for application
in ocular surface reconstruction. In addition, HPMC has excellent
film-forming capacity,21,30 making it easy to be incorporated
with other polymers such as collagen, hyaluronic acid, and chitosan
to form composite membranes.

To improve the in vivo transparency
of collagen membranes, HPMC
will be an excellent additive for cross-linked collagen to produce
collagen–HPMC composite membranes. The addition of HPMC in
the collagen membrane is expected to regulate collagen fibril spacing
and therefore improve the transparency of collagen. In the present
work, we used type I collagen to produce a collagen network by cross-linking
with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS).31 HPMC was then added to form the collagen–HPMC composite membrane.
The optical characteristics as well as nutrient diffusion of composite
membranes were measured. The in vitro biocompatibility of composite
membranes to corneal epithelial cells was also studied. We reported
the postoperative results of composite membrane implantation into
the corneas of rabbits so as to evaluate the feasibility of these
composite membranes as grafts or patches for corneal regeneration.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report to introduce
HPMC as an additive into collagen membranes to improve its in vivo
transparency.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication and Optical Properties of Collagen-Based
Membranes
Unlike other tissue transplantations, corneal transplantation
has a special requirement: corneal patches or substitutes should be
able to maintain transparency and suitable refractive indices when
implanted in vivo. Although type I collagen is widely studied as a
corneal substitute, collagen fibrils tend to aggregate, forming opaque
or semitransparent membranes at neutral pH.20 The low transparency of this material in vivo is a significant drawback
for clinical application in corneal regeneration.16,17,19,20

To produce
transparent membranes suitable for application as corneal patches,
it is essential to improve the optical properties of the collagen
membrane. In this work, this goal was achieved through the addition
of HPMC to collagen. Collagen–HPMC composite membranes and
cross-linked collagen membranes were successfully manufactured by
chemical cross-linking with EDC–NHS.31 The optical properties of both membranes were measured.

Figure 1 shows the
light transmittance curve of the collagen–HPMC composite membrane
and the cross-linked collagen membrane. The light transmittance of
both the membranes increased with the increase of wavelength. However,
the transparency of the collagen–HPMC membrane improved strikingly
when compared with that of the cross-linked collagen membrane. In
the case of the human cornea, the light transmittance was 80% at the
wavelength of 430 nm and increased with the increase of wavelength.32 The transparency of the cross-linked collagen
membrane was only 56% at 430 nm but that of the collagen–HPMC
membrane reached 78%, which is similar to that of the human cornea.
With increasing wavelength, the light transmittance of the collagen–HPMC
membrane increased and reached a maximum of 92%, which is higher than
that of the cross-linked collagen membrane. The light transmittance
of the collagen–HPMC membrane in the wavelength range of 300–900
nm is comparable to that of the human cornea.33 The refractive index of the collagen membrane also increased to
approximately 1.34 after incorporating HPMC (Table 1), which is close to that of the human cornea,
1.37–1.38.34 We also noted that
the refractive index of the cross-linked collagen membrane in our
study was identical with the results in the previous study conducted
by Griffith et al.35

It could be seen from the abovementioned results that
because of
the addition of HPMC, light transmittance and refractive index of
the composite membrane were enhanced and similar to those of the human
cornea. The improvement of transparency may be due to HPMC functioning
as a regulator, which regulated the collagen fibril spacing in the
composite membrane. From a previous study,36 Fourier transform infrared spectra results showed that there were
intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions between collagen and HPMC
in collagen–HPMC blend membranes. In addition, scanning electron
microscopy and atomic force microscopy images showed a more homogeneous
and compact structure of the collagen–HPMC blend membrane than
the collagen membrane, indicating good compatibility and miscibility
of collagen and HPMC.36,37 The intermolecular hydrogen bond
interactions may regulate the collagen fibril formation and arrangement,
resulting in the improvement of membrane transparency.

2.2 Equilibrium Water Content
The equilibrium
water content of membranes is an important factor for their application
to corneal reconstruction. Appropriate water content is essential
for the human cornea to deliver nutrients to the corneal cells. The
water content of the human cornea is 81%.38 In our study, the equilibrium water contents of the cross-linked
collagen and collagen–HPMC membranes are 76.5 and 83.4%, respectively
(Table 1). The water-uptake
capability of the collagen–HPMC membrane is similar to that
of the human cornea and is able to meet the requirement for use of
corneal substitutes.

2.3 Glucose, Tryptophan, and
NaCl Permeability
Nutrients are essential for the cornea
to remain transparent and
hydrated and to perform routine metabolism. As an avascular tissue,
the cornea intakes nutrients through the tear film, vitreous humor,
and stromal matrix by diffusion.39 Besides
glucose, other nutrient molecules such as tryptophan and NaCl are
also found in the cornea. Determining the permeability of glucose,
tryptophan, and NaCl through the corneal matrix could reflect the
permeability of the cornea to nutrients. Therefore, the permeability
of nutrients such as glucose, tryptophan, and NaCl was evaluated because
the membrane permeability is critical for use as corneal regeneration.

The permeability of the cross-linked collagen and collagen–HPMC
membranes to glucose, tryptophan, and NaCl is summarized in Table 1. The glucose diffusion
coefficients for the collagen–HPMC and cross-linked collagen
membranes are 5.29 ± 0.3 × 10–6 and 3.88
± 0.3 × 10–6 cm2/s, respectively,
which are superior to those of the human corneal stroma, which is
2.4 × 10–6 cm2/s.40 The tryptophan diffusion coefficients for the collagen–HPMC
and cross-linked collagen membranes are within the range of those
for human corneal stroma,41 which are 1.86
± 0.3 × 10–6 and 1.05 ± 0.3 ×
10–5 cm2/s, respectively. The NaCl diffusion
coefficients for the collagen–HPMC and cross-linked collagen
membranes were 8.03 ± 0.4 × 10–6 and 1.22
± 0.8 × 10–5 cm2/s, respectively,
both of which meet the requirement of the human cornea for NaCl permeability.42 Meanwhile, we noted that the addition of HPMC
into the collagen improved the permeability of membranes to glucose,
whereas it slowed down the permeability of tryptophan and NaCl. The
effect of HPMC on the permeability of composite membranes may be related
to the interaction between nutrient molecules and HPMC. Both membranes
have good permeability to nutrients and are suitable for corneal regeneration.

2.4 In Vitro Biocompatibility and Performance
Figure 2 shows the
morphology of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) cultured on cross-linked
collagen and collagen–HPMC membranes at day 3. Both of them
supported the attachment and proliferation of HCECs. The attachment
and proliferation of HCECs on collagen–HPMC membranes showed
no significant variation (p < 0.05) from those
on cross-linked membranes. As could be seen from Figure 2A, HCECs appeared healthy,
and no cytotoxic effects were observed when seeded on collagen–HPMC
membranes. Moreover, HCECs reached confluence on collagen–HPMC
membranes over 4 days (Figure 2C), indicating that the collagen–HPMC membrane is favorable
for HCEC overgrowth.

surfaces.

3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT)
assay was used to examine the viability and proliferation of HCECs
on the cross-linked collagen and collagen–HPMC membranes. Figure 3 shows the viability
of HCECs cultured on two different membranes at 1–5 consecutive
days. As seen from Figure 3, cells on the collagen–HPMC membrane showed great
increase in cell viability on days 4 and 5, and its cell viability
for 1, 2, 4, and 5 days was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those on the cross-linked collagen and cyclic citrullinated
peptide (CCP). Cell viability on the cross-linked collagen was similar
with that on CCP, showing no significant variation. According to MTT
results, the reproductive activity of HCECs on the collagen–HPMC
membranes was better than that on the cross-linked membranes, indicating
that the incorporation of HPMC into collagen could have some positive
effects on the membrane cytocompatibility, and these collagen–HPMC
membranes may have potential application as corneal patches for corneal
regeneration.

and cross-linked collagen membranes by MTT assay (MTT measured in
units of optical density at 490 nm).

2.5 Implantation and Postoperative Evaluation
To demonstrate the intraocular compatibility of our composite membranes
as grafts for corneal regeneration, interlamellar corneal transplantation
has been performed to assess the degree of composite membranes to
promote corneal regeneration in rabbits. The corneas as well as implants
remained clear right after transplantation (Figure 4A) and maintained optical clarity for over
6 months postoperatively. Meanwhile, no adverse inflammatory or immune
reactions were observed in the operative rabbit corneas after implantation
(Figure 4). The corneal
surfaces of the rabbits were smooth, and stroma and implants remained
clear throughout the time. No inflammation and hyperemia were observed
1 month after implantation. Only a mild rejection reaction was observed
2 weeks after transplantation, mainly because of the suture. Neovascularization
occurred at 1 month postoperatively but disappeared 1 week after.
A slit-lamp examination at 6 months postoperatively indicates that
the operative rabbit corneas remained clear and smooth (data not shown).

Figure 4 (A) Right
after transplantation, the cornea and collagen–HPMC
implants were clear, no adverse inflammatory or immune reactions were
observed, (B) postoperative observation of interlamellar corneal transplantation
at different time intervals.

Figure 5 shows
the
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections of collagen–HPMC implanted
corneas. As could be seen from the representative images, there was
good biocompatibility and connection between the implant and stroma
(Figure 5A,B). No inflammatory
cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, or new vessels, were observed.
The implant was almost degraded at 7 months postoperatively without
causing adverse inflammatory or immune reactions (Figure 5C,D). More interestingly, some
keratocytes were observed to grow into the superficial lamellae of
the implant during 5–7 months postoperatively (Figure 5,D), indicating that the new
corneal tissue regeneration may be developed as degradation takes
place. According to cornea implantation results, these collagen–HPMC
membranes have excellent intraocular biocompatibility while implanted
into rabbit corneas and may have the ability to promote a generation
of new stromal keratocytes.

3 Conclusions
We introduced HPMC into cross-linked collagen for the first time
to form a novel corneal substitute with excellent transparency. The
optical properties of the composite membranes were equivalent to those
of the human cornea, and the composite membranes implanted in rabbits
maintained a high optical clarity for over 6 months after transplantation.
Collagen–HPMC membranes also reproduced key features of the
human cornea, such as appropriate water content and sufficient permeability
to nutrients. Collagen–HPMC membranes were capable of supporting
the adhesion and proliferation of HCECs, showing good cytocompatibility
to human corneal cells in vitro. These membranes displayed good compatibility
with corneal tissues after implanting in rabbits in the intrastromal
surgical model and were able to induce repopulation of the stromal
keratocytes, indicating the potential ability to promote corneal tissue
regeneration. The abovementioned results demonstrated that the collagen–HPMC
composite membrane is a promising material for corneal regeneration.
The collagen–HPMC composite membrane may have future clinical
applications as patches in corneal repair and reconstruction. A more
comprehensive surgical model is needed to further evaluate the feasibility
of the composite membranes as grafts for corneal regeneration, and
postoperative observation is currently ongoing.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Type I bovine collagen
was produced by our laboratory. EDC and NHS were purchased from Shanghai
GL Biochem, China. HPMC (METHOCEL E series) was supplied by Dow Wolff
Cellulosics, Shanghai, China. Acetic acid and sodium hydroxide were
obtained from Tianjin Chemical Reagent No. 1 Plant, China. Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH = 7.6) was prepared by our laboratory. Deionized water
(YN-ZD-Z, Boxun, Shanghai) was used throughout.

4.2 Preparation of the Collagen–HPMC Composite
Membrane
Type I collagen (900 mg) was dissolved in a 3% (v/v)
acetic acid solution to obtain a concentration of 6 g L–1. HPMC (18 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and was
then added dropwise to the abovementioned solution at 4 °C. After
stirring with an electromagnetic stirrer for 1 h, calculated volumes
of EDC and NHS solutions were then added to cross-link the collagen.
This mixture required continuous stirring for 12 h or longer at 4
°C. Then, the pH of the abovementioned mixed solution was adjusted
to 5 ± 0.5 by injecting microliter quantities of 1 M aqueous
NaOH,9 followed by thorough mixing at 4
°C. The final homogeneous solution was immediately dispensed
into polypropylene molds (35 mm diameter) and dried to form collagen–HPMC
composite membranes at room temperature. All samples were removed
from the molds after soaking in deionized water for half an hour.
The resulting membranes were rinsed with deionized water repeatedly
and dried (the thickness of films was about 50 μm). For comparison
purposes, cross-linked collagen membranes were prepared without the
addition of HPMC in the same manner.

4.3 Optical
Properties
Light transmittance
of the collagen–HPMC composite membranes and cross-linked collagen
membranes in the wavelength of 350–900 nm was measured by a
UV3802 ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (Shanghai UNICO)
at room temperature. Before the test, all samples with dimensions
of 1 × 3 cm2 were equilibrated in PBS and then stuck
on a quartz colorimetric vessel. Refractive indices of collagen–HPMC
composite membranes and cross-linked collagen membranes equilibrated
in PBS were recorded on an Abbe refractometer (bromonaphthalene as
the calibration agent, 2 W, Shanghai Optical Instrument Factory, Shanghai)
at room temperature.

4.4 Equilibrium Water Content
The collagen–HPMC
composite and cross-linked collagen membranes were immersed in PBS
overnight at 4 °C. All samples were removed from PBS, the surface
water was gently blotted off, and then, the wet weights of the samples
were immediately recorded. The samples of known weight were then vacuum-dried
to constant weight. Water content (Wt) was calculated according
to the following equation:  where W0 and W denote
the weights of dry and PBS-equilibrated samples,
respectively.

4.5 Glucose, Tryptophan, and
NaCl Permeability
Diffusion permeability studies were carried
out at room temperature.43 The experimental
procedure was the same as stated
in a previous study.44 Briefly, the collagen–HPMC
composite membrane or cross-linked collagen membrane was placed between
two glass chambers, one assigned as a diffusion chamber with a buffer
of 2% glucose, 0.05% tryptophan, and 0.9% NaCl and the other assigned
as a receptor chamber with distilled water. The membrane was fixed
between the two chambers without leakage. Solutions in both the chambers
were stirred continuously while taking samples from the receptor chamber
at 1 h intervals. Well-established methods were used to measure the
concentrations of glucose, tryptophan, and NaCl,44 followed by a calculation of their permeability values
using a previous method.45

4.6 Cell Culture
The HCEC line from the
State Key Lab of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen
University, China, was used for the in vitro cytocompatibility study.
HCECs were cultured in a CO2 incubator with 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. A supplemented Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium was used to grow the cells, as stated in a previous
study.32

4.7 Morphological
Observation of HCECs
The collagen–HPMC composite membranes
and cross-linked collagen
membranes were washed three times in PBS under aseptic conditions,
sterilized by ultraviolet radiation for 2 h, and washed three times
in PBS again. The sterile cross-linked collagen and collagen–HPMC
composite membranes were attached on the bottom of the cell culture
plate, and 2 mL of HCECs were consequently seeded on the surface of
each membrane at a density of 5 × 104 cells/mL. After
cell culture on the surface of these membranes for 3 days, the cell
morphology was observed under an inverted phase contrast microscope.

4.8 Cell Viability and Proliferation Assay (MTT
Assay)
MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cell viability
and proliferation on the cross-linked collagen and collagen–HPMC
composite membranes over a 5 day cell culture. The experimental procedure
was the same as stated in a previous study.32

4.9 In Vivo Biocompatibility and Performance
4.9.1 Implantation
Collagen–HPMC
composite membranes, 100 μm thick and 6 mm in diameter, were
implanted into the corneas of New Zealand white rabbits. Briefly,
all implants were sterilized with ethylene oxide. Before implantation,
the implants were equilibrated in PBS and rinsed in a solution of
normal saline. Under general anesthesia, the rabbit corneas were excised
to the middle of the stromal layer in the central area of the cornea,
and the grafts of the collagen–HPMC composite membranes were
buried into the recipient corneal beds by using two interrupted 10–0
nylon sutures for closing the incision. Animals were not given steroids
postoperatively but only antibiotics (tobramycin) over the first postoperative
week. Sutures were removed at 3 weeks postoperatively.

4.10 Clinical and Histopathological Evaluation
Follow-ups
were conducted daily on each animal for 7 days postoperatively
and then weekly. Clinical examination mainly focused on slit-lamp
biomicroscopy (Topcon corporation, Japan) to evaluate the corneas
for optical clarity. Inflammation such as excessive redness or swelling
was evaluated if any, and neovascularization and degradation of grafts
were evaluated using a slit-lamp biomicroscopy instrument. At postoperative
5 and 7 months, three rabbits were euthanized each time, and the corneal
specimens were stained with H&E for routine histopathological
examination.
