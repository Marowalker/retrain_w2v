Expanding
the bioactivation toolbox of supramolecular materials
is of utmost relevance for their broad applicability in regenerative
medicines. This study explores the functionality of a peptide mimic
of the Notch ligand Jagged1 in a supramolecular system that is based
on hydrogen bonding ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) units. The functionality
of the peptide is studied when formulated as an additive in a supramolecular
solid material and as a self-assembled system in solution. UPy conjugation
of the DSLJAG1 peptide sequence allows for the supramolecular
functionalization of UPy-modified polycaprolactone, an elastomeric
material, with UPy-DSLJAG1. Surface presentation of the
UPy-DSLJAG1 peptide was confirmed by atomic force microscopy
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, but no enhancement
of Notch activity was detected in cells presenting Notch1 and Notch3
receptors. Nevertheless, a significant increase in Notch-signaling
activity was observed when DSLJAG1 peptides were administered
in the soluble form, indicating that the activity of DSLJAG1 is preserved after UPy functionalization but not after immobilization
on a supramolecular solid material. Interestingly, an enhanced activity
in solution of the UPy conjugate was detected compared with the unconjugated
DSLJAG1 peptide, suggesting that the self-assembly of supramolecular
aggregates in solution ameliorates the functionality of the molecules
in a biological context.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
Notch-signaling pathway is a cell–cell communication
pathway that regulates a variety of vital functions such as cell fate
decisions and terminal differentiation. It also contributes to development
and homeostasis of several tissues and organs.1,2 Particularly
relevant to in situ approaches in tissue engineering is the notion
that organism’s regenerative potential is related to the behavior
and self-renewal of stem cells, which is controlled by Notch ligand–receptor
engagement and the interaction of Notch signaling with the surrounding
extracellular matrix (ECM) components.3−5 The role of Jagged1 has
been emphasized in the renovation of stem cell populations,6,7 for which artificial niches for stem cells have been created by
integrating an active fragment on ECM-mimicking substrates.8 Furthermore, Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling
is shown to accelerate vascular repair when specifically overexpressed
in the endothelium9 and is also involved
in contrasting aging-related loss of regenerative potential. Kusumbe
et al. reported the revival of vascular niches when endothelial Notch
activity was restored in the aging organism, thereby highlighting
the pivotal role of the Notch pathway in tissue restoration.10 With these premises, we hypothesized that a
material capable of enhancing Notch-signaling activity has outstanding
potential to improve the outcome of regenerative therapies, with special
emphasis on those targeting the cardiovascular system.

A 17
amino acid-long peptide (DSLJAG1) capable of engaging
the Notch1 receptor was identified by Li et al.11 It corresponds to residues 188–204 of the Jagged1
ligand’s Delta/Serrate/Lag2 (DSL) region and showed Notch1
agonist activity.12 Polymers functionalized
via this Jagged1’s DSL-derived peptide have been created through
covalent modification of alginate and modulated stem cell behavior.13 A self-assembling hydrogel system developed
by Boopathy et al.14 was also functionalized
with the Jagged1-mimicking peptide and was injected in combination
with cardiomyocyte progenitor cells in a rat myocardial infarction
model. It was shown to significantly improve cardiac function and
reduce fibrosis compared to the pristine gel or the gel containing
the scrambled peptide sequence.15 Conversely,
Beckstead et al.16 observed no activation
of the Notch/CSL pathway when seeding primary human keratinocytes
on poly(2-hydrohyethyl methacrylate) surfaces functionalized with
the same Jagged1-mimicking peptide.

Most of the reported biomaterials
containing the Jagged1-mimicking
peptides are based on hydrogels, while elastomeric, solid materials
might be more preferable for load-bearing in situ tissue engineering
applications in terms of mechanical properties. At the best of our
knowledge, the only example of a biodegradable elastomeric material
modified with DSLJAG1 is achieved by applying conventional
carbodiimide–N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry to graft
the peptide to a poly(acrylic acid) brush grown on a substrate of
poly(l-lactide-co-caprolactone). In this
study by Wen et al., activation of the Notch-signaling pathway induced
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells toward the myogenic lineage.17

Supramolecular biomaterials based on the
four-fold hydrogen bonding
ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) moiety have been developed and investigated
for several biomedical applications because of their biocompatibility,
modular properties, and scalable production.18,19

In water, dimerized UPy units form stacks by binding laterally
via π–π and hydrophobic interactions. The hydrogen-bonded
stacks are shielded from the polar environment by hydrophobic alkyl
chains and water-stable oligo(ethylene glycol), thereby being stabilized
and allowed to form fibrous aggregates.20−22 This resulted in the
development of UPy particles that can be delivered inside cells.21 Furthermore, similar water-soluble UPy compounds
were designed to make supramolecular transient networks and hydrogels
that were applied for the delivery of various drugs to the heart and
kidney.20,23

With the aim to enlarge the application
prospects of this class
of biomedical materials, modular building blocks modified with UPy
groups have been employed to introduce bioactivity in several solid
materials to be used for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
Elastomeric, solid materials based on the UPy owe their dynamic nature
to the reversibility of the supramolecular interactions present in
the system. Both UPy motifs and flanking urea units contribute to
the supramolecular interactions, leading to a nanofibrous morphology
of the material.24 Robust incorporation
of UPy-functionalized bioactives in solid material systems is achieved
through intercalation inside the fibers of matching supramolecular
moieties and linkers used to functionalize the additive.25 Various UPy-functionalized compounds have been
developed to be applied as bioactive additives to generate supramolecular
elastomeric materials with improved cell adhesive (RGD, YIGSR),26 nonfouling (oligo(ethylene glycol)),27 heparin-binding (GLRKKLGKA),28 and antimicrobial29 and cell-attracting
(SDF-1α mimicking SKPVSLSYR)30 properties.
Here, for the first time, we target intercellular signaling processes
by means of a UPy-modified Jagged1-mimicking peptide (UPy-DSLJAG1) introduced into supramolecular systems. To achieve solid
material functionalization, UPy-DSLJAG1 (Figure 1A) was mixed into UPy-modified
polycaprolactone (UPy-PCL) (Figure 1B) and surface analyses were carried out on cast films
to confirm surface exposure of the additive. Supramolecular aggregates
were formed in aqueous solution (Figure 1C) and visualized by electron microscopy.
Subsequently, measurements of Notch-signaling activity in different
cell models revealed the role of the assembly state in the functionality
of UPy-DSLJAG1.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Synthetic Procedures
Telechellically
UPy-PCL (Mn = 2.7 kg/mol)
was synthesized according to previously described methods.31 Synthesis of Jagged1-mimicking peptide (DSLJAG1, MW = 2106.4 g/mol) was carried out on the solid phase
using standard Fmoc-chemistry to synthesize the sequence CDDYYYGFGCNKFCRPR.
Amino acids were activated with O-(1H-6-chlorobenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate
in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA) for 10 min before the coupling reaction. Conjugation of UPy–carboxylic
acid (UPy–COOH, MW = 1138.4 g/mol) to the N-terminus of DSLJAG1 was performed on the solid phase via an amide formation
strategy to obtain UPy-Jagged1 mimicking peptide (UPy-DSLJAG1, MW = 3226.8 g/mol). The UPy–carboxylic acid synthon was
activated with 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate
(HATU) in the presence of DIPEA for 30 min before the coupling reaction.
The products were purified with prep-RP-HPLC using gradients of acetonitrile
in water (with 0.1 vol % trifluoroacetic acid) and the collected fractions
were freeze-dried and analysed by reversed phase high-performance
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC–MS)
to confirm the purity. Detailed synthetic procedures and purifications
and general materials and instrumentations are described in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Preparation
of Drop Cast Surfaces
For preparation of UPy-PCL films, the
UPy-PCL polymer was dissolved
in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) at a concentration of
25 mg/mL. For preparation of UPy-DSLJAG1, functionalized
surfaces, 1 and 5 mol % of UPy-DSLJAG1, were mixed to UPy-PCL
from stock solutions in HFIP. Drop-cast films were prepared by distributing
50 μL of solution on a 13 mm Ø glass coverslip.
The HFIP was evaporated overnight in vacuo at 40 °C.

2.3 Material Characterization
2.3.1 Atomic
Force Microscopy
The atomic
force microscopy (AFM) phase and height images of drop-cast films
were recorded at room temperature using Digital Instruments MultiMode
NanoScope IV operating in the tapping regime mode using silicon cantilever
tips (PPP-NCHR, 204–497 kHz, 10–130 N/m). Images were
processed using Gwyddion software (version 2.43).

2.3.2 Water Contact Angle Measurements
Water contact angle
(WCA) measurements on drop-cast films were performed
on an OCA 30 system from Dataphysics using SCA20 software. A 5 μL
drop of deionized water was placed in three different regions of three
different samples. Images were captured 10 s after placement of the
water drop. WCAs were determined from the recorded images.

2.3.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on drop-cast
films prepared as described, and spectra were recorded using a Thermo
Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic, small-spot
X-ray source and a 180° double focusing hemispherical analyzer
with a 128-channel detector. Spectra were obtained using an aluminum
anode (Al Kα, 1486.6 eV) operating at 72 W. Survey scans were
measured at a pass energy of 200 eV and region scans at a pass energy
of 50 eV. Analysis and quantification of the spectra were performed
using the CasaXPS software version 2.3.16, using the C 1s, N 1s, O
1s, and S 1s regions.

2.3.4 Cryogenic Transmission
Electron Microscopy
For cryogenic transmission electron microscopy
(cryo-TEM), vitrified
films were prepared in a “Vitrobot’ instrument at 22
°C and at a relative humidity of 100%. In the preparation chamber
of the “Vitrobot”, a 3 μL sample was applied on
a Quantifoil grid (R 2/2, Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH), which was
surface plasma-treated just prior to use (Cressington 208 carbon coater
operating at 5 mA for 40 s). Excess sample was removed by blotting
using filter paper for 3 s at −3 mm, and the thin film thus
formed was plunged into liquid ethane just above its freezing point.
The vitrified film was transferred to a cryoholder (Gatan 626) and
observed at temperatures below −170 °C in FEI Titan TEM
equipped with a field emission gun and operating at 300 kV. Micrographs
were taken at low dose conditions, using a defocus setting of 10 μm
at 25 000 magnification (detail pictures), or a defocus setting
of 20 μm at 6500 magnification (overview pictures).

2.3.5 Nile Red Encapsulation Assay
Molecules
were dissolved in Milli-Q water at 50 μM concentrations and
the aggregates were allowed to form on a shaking plate overnight.
Nile Red was added to the solution to a final concentration of 5 μM
and samples were equilibrated for 5 min. Nile Red was excited at 550
nm and the emission intensity was recorded from 565 to 700 nm. Fluorescence
data were recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer
using Quartz cuvettes, and five scans were collected and averaged.

2.4 Cell Experiments
2.4.1 Cell
Culture
Human embryonic kidney
(HEK) 293T cells stably expressing full-length Notch1 (HEK293 FLN1)
were cultured under puromycin selection (1 μg/mL) in complete
medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco)
supplemented with 5 vol % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen)
and 1 vol % penicillin–streptomycin solution (Invitrogen),
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. HEK293
FLN1 were seeded at a concentration of 1.0 × 105 cells/cm2.

Primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells
(HCASMC, Lonza) were purchased at passage 3 and experiments were carried
out with cells at passage 5 or 6. Cells were cultured in 231 basal
medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5 vol % smooth muscle growth supplement
(SMGS, Gibco) and 1 vol % penicillin–streptomycin solution
(Invitrogen), at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator. As a control for the expression of α-smooth muscle
actin in the differentiated state, the basal medium was supplemented
with 1 vol % smooth muscle differentiation supplement (Gibco) instead
of SMGS. HCASMC was passaged at 80% confluency and seeded at a concentration
of 5 × 103 cells/cm2.

2.4.2 Activation of Notch Signaling by Immobilized
Ligands
For induction of Notch signaling with the immobilized
Jagged1 ligand, cell culture plates were coated overnight with recombinant
protein G (Thermo Fisher) 50 μg/mL in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS). After coating, plates were washed three times with PBS and
further blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA, 10 mg/mL) in PBS for
2 h. The blocked plates were washed three times with PBS and incubated
with recombinant Jagged1-Fc chimera (R&D systems) or only immunoglobulin
G Fc fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at concentrations of 1 μg/mL
in BSA 1 mg/mL in PBS for 3 h. After washing 3× with PBS, cells
were immediately seeded on the coated plates.32

The activity of soluble DSLJAG1 and UPy-DSLJAG1 was investigated by the addition of 10, 50, and 100 μM
compounds to the culture medium from stock solutions in dimethylsulphoxide
(DMSO). Inhibition was performed by the addition of 10 μM N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl
ester (DAPT, Sigma-Aldrich) to the culture medium from stock solutions
in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). For vehicle control, all other groups were
treated with the same amount of DMSO.

2.4.3 Reporter
Assay
HEK293 FLN1 cells
were transfected with a previously described 12× CSL-luciferase
reporter construct33 (250 ng per 105 cells) directly in the culture flask one day before seeding.
Poly(ethylene imine) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a transfection vector
in the 2:1 ratio with the DNA construct. Luminescence intensity was
detected after 48 h from seeding with a Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega)
following manufacturer’s instruction (n ≥
6).

2.4.4 Gene Expression Analyses
For gene
expression analysis, HCASMC was cultured on the different substrates
(n = 3) for 48 h. Total RNA was isolated using the
RNAeasy isolation kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with 300 ng RNA
per sample using the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse
transcriptase enzyme/kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were subjected to
quantitative polymerase chain reaction using iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad) and the Bio-Rad IQ5 detection system (version 1.6). mRNA
expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
as the reference gene and expressed as fold increase with respect
to the control group. Primer sequences can be found in the Supporting Information.

2.4.5 Immunofluorescent
Staining
α-Smooth
muscle actin expression was detected in differentiated HCASMC that
were cultured on the different substrates (n ≥
3) for 7 days. Cells were first washed with PBS, fixated in 3.7% formaldehyde
(Merck) for 10 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-100 (Merck) for 15 min. Nonspecific binding of antibodies was minimized
by incubating twice in 1% horse serum (Gibco) for 30 min. Cells were
then incubated with the primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-smooth
muscle actin) (Dako, M0851) in 4% horse serum in PBS + 1% Tween at
room temperature for 90 min. Subsequently, cells were washed with
PBS + 1% Tween and incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor
555-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody) (Life Technologies, A-21422)
in the dark for 45 min, followed by incubation with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (0.1 μg/mL) in PBS for 5 min. Finally, samples were washed
and mounted on cover glasses with Mowiol (Sigma). Samples were imaged
with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M epifluorescence microscope.

2.5 Statistical Analyses
Data are presented
as average ± standard deviation. Statistically significant differences
were determined using a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed
by Dunn’s posthoc test. Asterisks in the figures indicate significant
differences (*p < 0.05). All statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software,
Inc.).

3 Results & Discussion
3.1 Peptide Synthesis and UPy Functionalization
Synthesis
of the Jagged1-mimicking peptide (DSLJAG1)
was achieved using standard Fmoc-chemistry on a solid support. Conjugation
of the UPy moiety to peptide’s N-terminus on the solid support
was performed using a UPy–carboxylic acid synthon activated
with HATU in the presence of DIPEA to obtain the compound UPy-DSLJAG1 (Scheme S1). Compounds DSLJAG1 (31 mg, 31% yield) and UPy-DSLJAG1 (23 mg,
35% yield) were obtained as white powders after prep-RP-HPLC purification.
Detailed results of RP-HPLC–MS analyses are available in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

3.2 Characterization of Functionalized UPy-PCL
Surfaces
UPy-PCL films, pristine or with addition of 1 and
5 mol % UPy-DSLJAG1, were cast from solution and studied
by tapping-mode AFM, XPS, and WCA to investigate the topography and
confirm exposure of the peptide on the surface. Phase-mode AFM micrographs
of pristine UPy-PCL confirm the presence of a nanofiber network, with
the appearance of phase-separated domains when UPy-DSLJAG1 is added (Figure 2A). Images recorded in the height mode are available in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). We propose
that the domains visible on the AFM micrographs of UPy-PCL + 1–5
mol % UPy-DSLJAG1 correspond to an enhanced exposure of
the UPy–peptide at the surface. XPS measurements show that
the intensity of the characteristic nitrogen peak increases and the
characteristic sulfur peak appears when the peptide is introduced
(Figure 2B,C). Elemental
analysis indicated that the relative abundance of nitrogen and sulfur
increased from 4.9 to 0.0%, respectively, in the pristine material
to 8.3 and 0.7%, respectively, with the addition of 1 mol % UPy-DSLJAG1. With the addition of 5 mol % of UPy-DSLJAG1, these values changed to 9.9 and 1.0% (Table 1). From the results of elemental analysis,
it can be deducted that increasing the concentration of the additive
in the supramolecular mix above 5 mol % might not lead to significant
increase in the surface presentation of UPy-DSLJAG1. Surface
abundance of nitrogen and sulfur seems to not scale linearly with
the concentration but rather reached toward a plateau at 5 mol %.
Indeed, UPy-PCL films containing up to 10 and 25 mol % UPy-DSLJAG1 appeared fragile and lost partly their integrity (data
not shown), suggesting that such composition would not prove suitable
for applications that require a solid material. AFM micrographs confirm
that the system appears to reach surface saturation around a mixing
concentration of UPy-DSLJAG1 of 5 mol % as the surface
is almost fully covered with phase-separated domains.

Table 1 Relative Atomic Abundance of UPy-PCL
Surfaces Functionalized with UPy-DSLJAG1
surface	carbon [%]	oxygen [%]	nitrogen
[%]	sulfur [%]	
UPy-PCL	75.0	20.1	4.9	0.0	
+1 mol % UPy-DSLJAG1	71.7	19.3	8.3	0.7	
+5 mol % UPy-DSLJAG1	70.5	18.6	9.9	1.0	
It is
relevant for biomaterials to investigate whether the modification
affects their hydrophilicity. The measured WCA of pristine UPy-PCL
is 72° ± 1°, and it slightly decreases to 68°
± 1° and 67° ± 1° when UPy-DSLJAG1 is mixed with UPy-PCL in concentrations of 1 and 5 mol %, respectively.
The WCA values are in line with previously reported WCAs of UPy-PCL
systems with the addition of UPy-functionalized additives34 and are likely to not influence cell adhesion
and behavior on the polymer films.

3.3 Activity
of UPy-DSLJAG1 Peptide
Immobilized on a Solid Biomaterial Surface
In view of the
bioactivity tests on a supramolecular material substrate, the response
of the HEK293 FLN1 cell line to the immobilized full-length Jagged1
ligand was screened. Notch-signaling activity increased dose-dependently
when increasing the concentration of the coating solution used to
immobilize the full-length extracellular domain of the Jagged1 ligand
(Figure S3). Culturing HEK293 FLN1 cells
on immobilized FcJagged1 resulted in a significant increase in reporter
activity, and the addition of DAPT, a γ-secretase inhibitor,
lowered CSL reporter activity toward Fc-control levels (Figure 3). Activation of the Notch
pathway was tested on polymer films containing 5 mol % UPy-DSLJAG1 because the material characterizations revealed that the
amount of additive present at the surface is directly proportional
to its concentration in the drop-casting solution. Conversely to FcJagged1
on plastic, no difference in Notch-signaling activity was detected
on the drop-cast polymer functionalized with 5 mol % UPy-DSLJAG1 in comparison with pristine UPy-PCL. Consistently, the DAPT has
no inhibitory effect on the observed signal intensity (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Effect of immobilized
5 mol % UPy-DSLJAG1 on the activation
of 12× CSL-Luc in HEK293 FLN1, compared with the FcJagged1 ligand
as the positive control. Data are normalized with respect to the negative
control (Fc-fragment coating only).

The effect of surface functionalization of UPy-PCL was investigated
in a coronary artery smooth muscle cell (CASMC) model expressing the
Notch3 receptor. Exposure of CASMC to FcJagged1-coated substrates
induced upregulation of Notch target genes related to the regulation
of transcription (HES1, HEY1) and to a positive feedback regulation
of ligand and receptor production (JAG1, NOTCH3) (Figure 4A,C). A phenotypic switch of
CASMC to α-SMA expressing differentiated cells was observed
as well on substrates coated with FcJagged1, on which expression of
α-SMA was confirmed both on the mRNA level (ACTA2) and protein
level by immunostaining (Figure 4E,G-top row). On substrates containing immobilized
UPy-DSLJAG1, however, no upregulation of any of the mentioned
genes was detected (Figure 4B,D), as well as no expression of α-SMA (Figure 4F,G-bottom row). Taken together,
the data confirm that cell models expressing Notch1 and Notch3 receptors
are responsive to surface-immobilized FcJagged1 but not to supramolecularly
immobilized Jagged1-mimicking peptide, UPy-DSLJAG1.

phenotype visualized by immunofluorescence by DAPI (blue) and α-SMA
(magenta) staining (scale bar is 100 μm).

One of the possible explanations of inactivity of the immobilized
peptide could be a lack of strong anchoring of the peptide to the
material, as the proposed mechanism of Jagged1-mediated Notch-signaling
activation involves a traction force exerted by the membrane-bound
ligand on the receptor. Wang and Ha35 calculated
experimentally the tension necessary to activate both integrin receptor
and Notch1 receptors by immobilizing to a tension gauge tether RGDfK
and Dll1 ligands, respectively. They found out that less than 12 pN
was necessary to activate Notch signaling in CHO-1 cells, while a
higher tension of approximately 40 pN was required to trigger cell
adhesion and spreading. Based on these data, we speculate that it
is unlikely that inactivity of UPy-DSLJAG1 immobilization
is due to an insufficient pulling force generated on UPy-PCL, availing
ourselves with existing evidence of cells responding to supramolecularly
immobilized UPy-RGD with improved adhesion and morphology.26

After ligand–receptor engagement,
intercellular phenomena
of ligand internalization and contribution of modulators occur on
both the signal-sending and signal-receiving cell sides,36−38 and glycosylation of Notch receptor’s epidermal growth factor-like
repeats is believed to be crucial as well.39,40 This complex mechanism might be insufficiently reproduced on our
fully synthetic supramolecular material. Furthermore, short ligand
mimics like DSLJAG1 might have diminished affinity for
their target receptor, and the surface analyses in Figure 2 suggest that the ligand concentration
on a surface is limited. As a consequence, the affinity of the surface-bound
Jagged1-mimicking peptide for Notch receptors might not be sufficient
to activate Notch signaling. In light of this, we hypothesize that
the results reported are consequences of ineffective ligand presentation
on the surface.

3.4 Characterization of the
UPy-DSLJAG1 Assembly in Solution
UPy-DSLJAG1 is equipped
with two alkyl chains (C6 and C12, respectively) intercalated by a
hydrogen bonding urea unit that ensure the formation of stable stacks
in polar media. Furthermore, UPy-DSLJAG1 contains by design
a hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) spacer with 12 ethylene glycol
repeating units, which provide additional stability to the assembled
aggregates in solution. Additionally, we know from previous studies
that UPy compounds with this design assemble in an aqueous environment
into fibrous aggregates.21,22 Therefore, aqueous
solutions of DSLJAG1 and UPy-DSLJAG1 were analyzed
by cryo-TEM. Cryo-TEM micrographs of unconjugated DSLJAG1 show no signs of clusters (Figure 5A, left; Figure S4A). On
the contrary, UPy-DSLJAG1 appears to form a number of worm-like
aggregates (Figure 5A right, Figure S4B). In order to further
prove the self-assembly of UPy-DSLJAG1 into fibrous stacks,
solutions of DSLJAG1 and UPy-DSLJAG1 at 50 μM
were incubated with Nile Red and excited at 550 nm. Only the solution
of UPy-DSLJAG1, but not the nonfunctionalized DSLJAG1, resulted in a strong fluorescent emission with a maximum at 634
nm (Figure 5B), which
corresponds to the emission of Nile Red in a lipophilic environment.41

arrowheads
indicating fibrous assemblies (scale bar is 50 nm). (B) Nile Red intensity

3.5 Activity of UPy-DSLJAG1 Nanoaggregates
in Solution
Nanoaggregates of UPy-DSLJAG1 were
administered in solution to HEK293 FLN1 cells stimulated with immobilized
full-length FcJagged1 (or only Fc fragment as the control). This experimental
setup allows decoupling of the effects of the distribution of UPy-DSLJAG1 in the UPy-PCL matrix from the effect of UPy functionalization
of the Jagged1-mimicking peptide sequence.

Exposure of the HEK293
FLN1 cell line to soluble DSLJAG1 and UPy-DSLJAG1 in different concentrations resulted in a significant two-fold increase
in the 12× CSL-Luc activity on the control Fc-coated substrate
(Figure 6). The observed
increase in Notch activity was lowered back to control levels by addition
of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Figure S5). These evidences are in agreement with literature, as several
authors reported the use of the soluble Jagged1-mimicking peptide
in order to activate Notch signaling in different cell models or tissues.
These reports show either direct evidence of Notch activation, such
as Notch intracellular domain cleavage42 and regulation of transcription43 or
further downstream Notch function-related events, such as contractile
differentiation of arterial smooth muscle cells.44 In the proposed model of canonical Notch-signaling activation,
the anchoring of the ligand or ligand-mimic to the material surface
seems to be an absolutely necessary condition. Nevertheless, it is
apparently possible that in certain cell models, the presentation
of ligands, receptors, or modulators occurs in concentrations or configurations
that allow transcending of the classical conditions required to initiate
the Notch activation cascade. A recent study from Luca et al. supports
this statement, as it reports on a high-affinity version of the Jagged1
ligand, which requires threshold activation forces that are lower
than the wild-type ligand.45 Importantly,
the capability of UPy-DSLJAG1 of activating Notch signaling
in the soluble form, equally to DSLJAG1, confirms that
UPy functionalization does not affect its functionality in terms of
Notch receptor engagement.

Figure 6 Effect of soluble DSLJAG1 (pink bars)
and UPy-DSLJAG1 (red bars) on Notch-signaling activity
in the HEK293 FLN1
cell line cultured on Fc coating (basal activity—white bar)
or FcJagged1 coating (enhanced basal activity—black bar). Soluble
molecules are used at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 μM.
Data are normalized with respect to the Fc control.

The effect of soluble DSLJAG1 or UPy-DSLJAG1 is milder than the effect of immobilized full-length FcJagged1,
which causes a 3.6-fold increase in the 12× CSL-Luc activity.
On FcJagged1-coated surfaces, the addition of soluble UPy-DSLJAG1 at different concentrations in the culture medium resulted
in a significant 1.6-fold increase in Notch-signaling activity with
respect to the FcJagged1 stimulation alone, while there was no effect
of nonfunctionalized DSLJAG1. Clustering of ligands and
receptor has been proposed to direct Notch signaling as well.46−48 Morrison et al. reported that a soluble FcDll1 dimer was not able
to activate Notch signaling, but a multimer preclustered via antibodies
could at least lead to ligand binding.49 Along the same lines, Narui and Salaita employed lipid membranes
with tunable dynamics to control the lateral mobility of FcDll4 ligands
and found out that the conditions in which ligand’s mobility
was constrained resulted in activation of Notch receptors.50 Similarly, the concentration of the DSLJAG1 peptide into supramolecular stacks recalls a clustering
behavior that might be sufficient to increase the affinity of UPy-DSLJAG1 for the Notch receptors of HEK293 FLN1 cells. However,
clustering of Jagged1-mimicking peptides does not explain the increase
in Notch-signaling activity observed equally with both DSLJAG1 and UPy-DSLJAG1 on Fc-coated substrates. It is proposed
that two different mechanisms of Notch activation might be involved
on the different substrates, leading to the different magnitudes of
the response of HEK293 FLN1 to soluble (UPy-)DSLJAG1 on
Fc or FcJagged1 coatings. The stimulation by immobilized FcJagged1
leads to a series of feedback events at the level of the ligand and
receptor, for example, causing clustering of the receptors themselves,51 which might lead to a propensity of receptors
to stimuli from UPy-DSLJAG1. On the other hand, on Fc-coated
plates, the binding of (UPy-)DSLJAG1 might occur on unstimulated
receptors that do not differentiate between clustering, or lack of,
between DSLJAG1 molecules.

Although the UPy-modified
Jagged1-mimiciking peptide was found
to preserve a certain amount of activity in the soluble form, this
is not immediately applicable in tissue engineering that requires
solid materials. The findings in Figure 6 might be useful in applications that require,
for example, release of bioactives. However, these results require
further investigation to precisely ascertain the dependence of the
phenomena on the cell type and context. During our study, we incurred
into a variability of cell response to soluble additives, with different
cell populations of the same cell line responding to both immobilized
FcJagged1 and soluble (UPy-)DSLJAG1 with very different
intensities of Notch-signaling activity (Figures S6 and S7).

Based on these results, the creation of a
bioactive material suitable
for cardiovascular tissue engineering that activates Notch signaling
via a short Jagged1-mimicking peptide could better occur through the
design of multivalent peptide-bearing additives or by means of a system
that allows coupling of the full-length FcJagged1 extracellular domain
to the material surface.

4 Conclusions
Conjugation
of a UPy unit to a Jagged1-mimicking peptide allowed
for the assembly of the UPy-DSLJAG1 compound as an additive
into a supramolecular material in the solid state and as an aggregate
in aqueous solution via dynamic noncovalent interactions. Surface
analyses confirmed that direct mixing of UPy-DSLJAG1 into
solid UPy-PCL resulted in its surface exposure after film casting.
In vitro studies on cell models expressing Notch1 and Notch3 receptors
revealed that UPy-DSLJAG1 is not efficient as a solid additive
in achieving activation of the Notch/CSL pathway. The truncated DSLJAG1 peptide appears to have preserved Notch-activating properties
on our Notch1 receptor expressing cell model in the soluble form.
Furthermore, the conjugation of a UPy moiety to the Jagged1-mimicking
peptide sequence seems to increase its ability to target the Notch
receptor in the assembled state.
