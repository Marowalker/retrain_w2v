The
structure–adsorption behavior–dispersion property
relationship plays a key role in designing a dispersant or surfactant,
such as a coal–water dispersant and a water-reducing agent.
In this work, was classified into three fractions with narrow molecular
weight distributions via the ultrafiltration method. The adsorption
behavior of these three fractions was tested via a quartz crystal
microbalance with dissipation monitoring, which showed that the adsorption
amounts of the three fractions were far higher than that of sulfomethylated
lignin. Fraction-1, with the lowest molecular weight, exhibited the
greatest adsorption amount on a Au surface under salt-free conditions.
This result illustrates that the alkyl chain is more effective for
dispersants with low molecular weight to improve its adsorption amount.
Fraction-3, with the highest molecular weight, exhibited the greatest
adsorption amount on a Au surface under salt-added conditions. This
result further illustrates that both the alkyl chain and salt are
positive factors for improving the adsorption amount of dispersants.
More importantly, the dispersion stabilization of the TiO2 slurry was significantly improved using the alkAL-S fractions, especially
Fraction-3. Based on these results, the alkyl chain cross-linked of
lignosulfonate is a promising approach for the industrial applications
of lignin as an applicable dispersant.

1 Introduction
After cellulose, lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer
among all the renewable natural resources.1 In the purest sense, lignin is a three-dimensional, amorphous, and
polyphenolic material that originates from three primary precursors:
coniferyl, sinapyl, and p-coumaryl alcohols.2 Technical lignin, produced from soda pulping
processes, is difficult to be utilized efficiently because of its
low molecular weight and poor water solubility at a neutral pH.3,4 Therefore, technical lignin usually needs to be modified before
use in diverse industrial applications.3,5−8

It is a known fact that the molecular weight (Mw) and the sulfonic group content are the key factors
that influence the properties of technical lignin and its potential
for use as an excellent dispersant in cement,9,10 coal–water
slurry,11 pesticide suspension,12 and so on. To improve Mw, methods including formaldehyde condensation polymerization13,14 and graft copolymerization15−17 are commonly used. To increase
the sulfonic group content, methods including sulfonation,5,6 sulfomethylation,7,8 and graft sulfonation18 are used.

The adsorption behavior is the
main measurement used by researchers
to investigate the dispersion mechanism of lignosulfonate in the suspension
system. The conventional research methods used to study the adsorption
behavior include UV spectrophotometry19,20 and electrostatic
self-assembly.21,22 UV spectrophotometry is a widely
applied technology that investigates the amount of dispersants adsorbed
on the particle surface, but it cannot detect the conformation of
the adsorbed layer. When the electrostatic self-assembly method is
used, polycation electrolytes, such as poly(diallyl dimethylammonium
chloride), are introduced, and it is difficult to prepare a metastable
self-assembled film. Furthermore, both these methods suffer from the
inability to measure the adsorption behavior in real time. Thus, finding
a better way to investigate these dispersion mechanisms in real time
is critical. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring
(QCM-D) is a fundamental and efficient research method for better
detecting the adsorption amount in real time and conformation of the
adsorbed layer.23−25 Therefore, QCM-D was applied to test the adsorption
behavior in our paper.

The results of previous studies showed
that the adsorption amount
of a high-Mw lignin polymer is greater
than that of a low-Mw lignin polymer,
and the ionic strength could enhance the adsorption amount by shielding
the electrostatic repulsion between the sulfonic groups and enhancing
the hydrophobic effect on the Au surface.22,26 Here, an alkyl chain was introduced to sulfomethylated lignin (AL-S)
to improve the Mw of lignin via the alkyl
chain cross-linked polymerization method. This method is more efficient
and convenient to improve than the other reported methods for improving
the Mw of lignin.13−17 Ultrafiltration (UF) of lignosulfonate is an efficient
method to obtain lignin-based polymers with narrow Mw distributions.27−30 Therefore, a UF device was applied to purify and
classify alkyl chain cross-linked lignosulfonate (alkAL-S) to obtain
different fractions with narrow Mw distributions,
denoted as Fraction-1, Fraction-2, and Fraction-3, and the adsorption
behaviors of the three alkAL-S fractions on the Au surface were measured
by QCM-D. Unexpectedly, the effect of the alkyl chain on the adsorption
behaviors of the three fractions is distinct. The effect of ionic
strength on the adsorption behavior was further investigated. Moreover,
the dispersion stabilization of TiO2 was significantly
improved using the three fractions. Therefore, in our study, the adsorption
amount and dissipation factor could be readily improved by introducing
an alkyl chain into lignosulfonate, and excellent and suitable dispersants
could be designed for industrial applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Molecular Weight Distributions
of the alkAL-S
Fractions
The Mw distributions
of the initial AL-S and alkAL-S are presented in Figure 1a. The average Mw and the polydispersity index (PDI) are also given in Table 1. The molecular weight
of alkAL-S is remarkably increased via alkyl chain-bridged polymerization.
The Mw of alkAL-S (61,200 Da) is approximately
11.3 times higher than that of AL-S (5400 Da). The results of the
functional group content show that the phenolic group content of alkAL-S
decreased remarkably (from 2.21 to 0.51 mmol/g).

(AL-S) and alkyl chain cross-linked lignosulfonate (alkAL-S) (a),
and the three different alkAL-S fractions with narrow molecular weight
distributions (b).

samples	Mw (Da)	Mn (Da)	PDI	-OH (mmol/g)	SO3 (mmol/g)	
AL-S	5400	2600	2.08	2.21	1.81	
alkAL-S	61,200	19,800	3.09	0.51	1.62	
Fraction-1	5800	3900	1.49	1.12	1.87

Fraction-3	152,000	83,900	1.81	0.11	1.51	
The effect of the UF method on the Mw distribution of alkAL-S is shown in Figure 1b. The value PDI of alkAL-S
is wide, although
the Mw increased noticeably (see Figure 1a). Based on the
UF method, the Mw distribution of the
fractions separated by three membranes is very narrow and symmetric
(see Figure 1b). The
results of the Mw distribution are also
provided in Table 1. All the three fractions have a low PDI in the range of 1.49–1.81.
The average Mw’s of Fraction-1,
Fraction-2, and Fraction-3 are 5800, 43,600, and 152,000 Da, respectively.
The results are relatively equivalent to the membrane characteristics
applied to classify alkAL-S.

The functional group contents of
the alkAL-S fractions were assessed,
as shown in Table 1. Increasing the Mw, the functional group
contents of the three fractions decreased, including −OH, −SO3H, and especially −OH. The elemental analyses of the
three alkAL-S fractions were also investigated in our study (see Table 2). As expected, the
content of C and H increased, and the S content decreased with the
increasing Mw of fractions. The results
are consistent with the results of the functional group contents.

Fraction-3	52.56	6.336	0.09	5.329	
2.2 Structural Characterization
To better
elucidate the structural characteristics of the three alkAL-S fractions,
spectroscopic analyses, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), were performed
(see Figure 2). The
interpretations of the FTIR spectra are shown in Figure 2a. The broad band at approximately
3450 cm–1 corresponds to O–H elongation,31 and the peaks at 2937 and 2860 cm–1 are due to the methylene stretching vibrations of the alkyl chain
of C6H12Br2.13,32 As the Mw of the alkAL-S fractions increased,
the intensity of A3450 decreased, whereas
that of A2937 increased gradually; this
result is in agreement with the functional group content results.

Figure 2 Spectroscopic
analysis results of the three alkAL-S fractions:
(a) FTIR spectra of the fraction samples, (b) 1H NMR spectra
of the fraction samples.

The 1H NMR
spectra of the three fractions are presented
in Figure 2b. The signals
between 0.5 and 2.0 ppm are ascribed to aliphatic chain protons.33,34 The signal intensity of the aliphatic H exhibits a strong positive
correlation with the increasing Mw of
the alkAL-S fractions. The results are also consistent with the IR
results. Therefore, through the series of characterizations of the
alkAL-S fractions separated from the three membranes, the UF method
is a feasible and powerful technique to obtain alkAL-S fractions with
a very low polydispersity.

2.3 Film-Forming Properties
and Wetting Properties
on Au Surface
To investigate the effect of the alkAL-S fractions
with different Mw’s on the particle
distribution of aggregates, the film-forming morphology of the three
fractions on a Au surface was observed by atomic force microscopy
(AFM). As can be observed in Figure 3a–c, Fraction-1, with the lowest Mw, has the minimum surface roughness (root mean square,
RMS), and RMS increases gradually as the Mw of the three fractions increases. Moreover, the morphology shows
that the particle size gradually increases from Fraction-1 to Fraction-3.
These results illustrate that the aggregation level becomes higher
with the increasing Mw of the alkAL-S
fractions.

Figure 3 (a–c) Film-forming properties of the three alkAL-S fractions
on a Au surface (size: 1 × 1 μm); (d–f) wetting
properties of the three alkAL-S fractions on a Au surface.

The wetting properties of the three alkAL-S fractions on
a Au surface
were all assessed by contact angle measurements. As can be observed
in Figure 3d–f,
the contact angles of the alkAL-S fractions on Au gradually increase
from Fraction-1 to Fraction-3. This result indicates that the affinity
of Fraction-1 for the Au surface is relatively higher than that of
Fraction-2 and Fraction-3 for the Au surface.

2.4 Adsorption
Behavior Measurement by QCM-D
The adsorption behavior of
the three alkAL-S fractions on a Au
surface was investigated by QCM-D. QCM-D is an efficient tool that
provides information about the adsorption amount, adsorbed layer conformation,
and viscoelasticity changes.35 The adsorption
amount of the alkAL-S fractions could be detected by determining the
decrease in frequency (ΔF); the conformation
and viscoelasticity of the adsorbed layer could also be observed by
evaluating the changes in dissipation (ΔD).18 As shown in Figure 4a, we investigated the adsorption behavior
of the samples at a concentration of 1 g/L under salt-free conditions;
the adsorption amount of AL-S was the lowest because of its strong
hydrophilicity. The results showed that the adsorption amounts of
the three alkAL-S fractions increased compared with that of the straw
material AL-S. As proposed in Figure 6, an alkyl chain was introduced to the AL-S molecules
to improve the compatibility of the alkAL-S fractions. More importantly,
Fraction-1 exhibited the highest adsorption amount and dissipation
factor, which were even greater than that of lignosulfonate.23 The adsorption amount decreased with the increasing Mw of the alkAL-S fractions. This result occurred
mainly because of the structural difference among the three alkAL-S
fractions (see Figure 6). As seen from Figure 6, the size of the aggregates in Fraction-1 is smaller than that of
the other two fractions, and therefore, the alkyl chain more effectively
shields the electrostatic repulsions between the sulfonic groups in
Fraction-1 than in the other fractions. The desorption of the samples
is also investigated in Figure 4a, in which AL-S exhibits larger desorption amounts than the
three alkAL-S fractions.

fractions on a
Au surface under a salt-free condition by the QCM-D method. (a) Change

curves). (b) Changes in dissipation as a function of the change in
frequency.

dimensions: 3 × 3 μm; bottom image dimensions: 1 ×
1 μm).

Figure 6 Proposed adsorption mechanism of AL-S and the
three alkAL-S fractions
adsorbed on a Au surface under the salt-free condition.

The adsorption process of the three alkAL-S fractions was
estimated
by plotting the change in ΔD as a function
of the changes in ΔF, and the plot was called
the D–F curve (see Figure 4b). The slope of
the D–F curve could be used
to illustrate the conformation and viscoelasticity of the adsorbed
layer and the affinity of the sample to a Au surface.36,37 As illustrated in Figure 4b, the slope of the AL-S curve is larger than that of the
three alkAL-S fraction curves, and furthermore, the slopes of the
alkAL-S fraction curves increased from Fraction-1 to Fraction-3. These
results suggested that there was a more compact conformation and a
stronger affinity between Fraction-1 and the Au surface. The conformation
of the adsorbed layer of Fraction-3 is obviously looser than that
of the other two fractions.

As investigated in Figure 3, the aggregation levels of
the alkAL-S fractions become higher
with the increasing Mw of the alkAL-S
fractions, and the affinity of Fraction-1 for Au is relatively stronger
than that of Fraction-2 and Fraction-3, which makes Fraction-1 preferred
for adsorption on a Au surface to form a compact adsorbed conformation.
The adsorption morphology of the three alkAL-S fractions adsorbed
on a Au surface was also observed by AFM, as shown in Figure 5. We found that the conformation
and size of the nanoaggregates were different for each of the fractions.
A very compact adsorbed layer consisting of nanoaggregates was observed
for Fraction-1 (see Figure 5a). The aggregate sizes
of Fraction-2 and Fraction-3 were relatively larger than that of Fraction-1,
and the nanoaggregates of Fraction-1 were more compact than those
of the other two fractions, both of which contributed to the remarkable
adsorption amount and low viscoelasticity of Fraction-1 on a Au surface.

2.5 Effect of Ionic Strength on the Adsorption
Behavior
In our study, we also investigated the effect of
ionic strength on the adsorption behavior of the alkAL-S fractions
on the Au surface. A 0.5 M NaCl salt concentration was applied in
the sample solutions. As seen from Figure 7a, the adsorption amounts of all the three
alkAL-S fractions increased compared with those of the salt-free solution
and were even greater than those that were previously reported.24 This result occurred mainly because the salt
shielded the electrostatic repulsions between the sulfonic groups.22 We also noted that the adsorption amount of
Fraction-3 was the greatest, but the adsorption amount of Fraction-2
was lower than that of Fraction-1. The results may be explained as
follows. First, the Mw distributions of
the alkAL-S fractions are remarkably narrow and symmetric, which is
conducive to preparing the uniform nanoaggregates. Second, although
the particle size of Fraction-2 is larger than that of Fraction-1,
the nanoaggregates formed in Fraction-1 were more compact than those
in Fraction-2. Therefore, based on the above mentioned factors, the
adsorption amount of Fraction-1 is greater than that of Fraction-2
but lower than that of Fraction-3. The desorption process of all the
alkAL-S fractions was also investigated after the adsorption equilibrium
was achieved (see Figure 7a). We found that all the alkAL-S fractions exhibited larger
desorption amounts after rinsing compared with the salt-free solution.
This result occurs because the density and viscosity of the solution
increased after the NaCl salt was added, which makes the adsorbed
layer on the Au surface more viscoelastic than that achieved under
salt-free conditions.

on a
Au surface with a 0.5 M NaCl solution by the QCM-D method. (a) Change
in frequency and dissipation (the rinsing step is also shown in the
curves). (b) Changes in dissipation as a function of the change in
frequency.

The dissipation as a function
of changes in the frequency in the
adsorption processes of the three alkAL-S fractions was also estimated,
as shown in Figure 7b. Unexpectedly, the slopes of the three fraction curves are very
close. This result indicated that the conformation of the adsorbed
layers from Fraction-2 and Fraction-3 had become more compact. We
also compared the slopes of the curves obtained with the salt-free
and salt-added conditions. All the slopes increased after 0.5 M NaCl
was added, indicating that the conformations of the adsorbed layer
became looser, and the viscoelasticity of the layer increased.

The adsorption morphology of the three alkAL-S fractions after
0.5 M NaCl was added on the Au surface was also observed by AFM, as
shown in Figure 8.
The aggregation levels of the three fractions improved, and the height
of the adsorbed layer noticeably increased. These results further
indicated that NaCl could shield the electrostatic repulsions and
promote the aggregation of the alkAL-S fractions.

surface with a 0.5 M NaCl solution: (a) Fraction-1, (b) Fraction-2,
and (c) Fraction-3 (top image dimensions: 3 × 3 μm; bottom
image dimensions: 1 × 1 μm).

2.6 Dispersion Properties in TiO2 Slurry
The adsorption property plays an important role in the dispersion
properties of dispersants in suspension systems, such as TiO2. TiO2 is widely applied as a mineral oxide in pigments
and paints and as nanomaterials.38,39 Because of
their large surface areas, TiO2 particles easily form agglomerates,
which negatively affects their performance in industrial applications.
Therefore, dispersants are applied to improve the dispersion stabilization
of TiO2 particles, which is very important for their industrial
applications.

As seen in Figure 9, the dispersion property of the TiO2 slurry
was relatively improved using AL-S compared with that obtained with
no additives (blank). When the three alkAL-S fractions were applied
to the TiO2 suspension slurry, the dispersion stability
of the TiO2 slurries containing the alkAL-S fractions improved
significantly and was better than that of the TiO2 slurry
containing AL-S. We found that the Mw of
Fraction-1 was close to that of AL-S, but the adsorption and dispersion
properties of Fraction-1 were both better than those of AL-S. This
result occurred because the alkyl chain in Fraction-1 improved the
affinity for the Au surface and provided steric hindrance between
the TiO2 particles. On the other hand, Fraction-3 exhibited
the best dispersion property in TiO2 compared with the
other fractions because of its moderate sulfonic group content and
high Mw, which improved the steric hindrance
and electrostatic repulsion between the sample-coated TiO2 particles.

3 Conclusions
To summarize, alkyl chain cross-linked
lignosulfonate (alkAL-S)
was prepared from a pulping liquor and applied to classify and obtain
three different fractions with a narrow Mw distribution via a UF method. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), FTIR, and 1H NMR
measurements were performed to investigate the molecular structure
of these three fractions. We found that alkAL-S with different fractions
exists as nanoaggregates with different particle sizes. The adsorption
properties determined via QCM-D showed that the adsorption amounts
of the three fractions were far higher than that of AL-S. Fraction-1
exhibited the greatest adsorption amount on a Au surface under a salt-free
condition. This result illustrates that the alkyl chain is more effective
for a dispersant with a low Mw to improve
the adsorption amount. Fraction-3 exhibited the greatest adsorption
amount on a Au surface under a salt-added condition. This result further
illustrates that both the alkyl chain and salt are positive factors
to improve the adsorption amount of dispersants. More importantly,
the dispersion stabilization properties of the TiO2 slurry
were improved significantly using the three alkAL-S fractions, especially
Fraction-3. Based on these results, the alkyl chain cross-linking
of lignosulfonate is a promising approach for using lignin as an applicable
dispersant in industrial applications.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Wheat straw alkali lignin
(WAL) was supplied by Shuntai Paper Pulping Co., Ltd. (Shuntai, Hunan,
China). 1,6-Dibromohexane (C6H12Br2) with a purity of 97% was supplied by Energy Chemical (Shanghai,
China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade, including formaldehyde
(CH2O) of 37%, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium sulfite
(Na2SO3), potassium iodide (KI), and hexane.
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder was a commercial product
obtained from Kermel Chemistry Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).

4.2 Preparation of Alkyl Chain Cross-Linked Lignosulfonate
(alkAL-S)
WAL was dissolved in an alkaline NaOH solution
with a pH of approximately 10. Formaldehyde was added slowly to the
reaction solution at 70 °C for 20 min. Then, the temperature
was heated to 95 °C, and sodium sulfite was added subsequently.
Then, the reaction was maintained at 95 °C for 3 h. When the
temperature was cooled to 80 °C, a C6H12Br2 reagent and a trace amount of KI were added to the
reaction solution, and NaOH was used to maintain a pH of 12. The polymerization
reaction was stopped after the solution was refluxed at 80 °C
for 9 h. The sample was then extracted with hexane to remove the excess
C6H12Br2, and the polymer in the
aqueous solution was obtained.

4.3 UF of
alkAL-S To Obtain Different Fractions
The UF fractions were
obtained using an UF201 ultrafiltration apparatus
(Wuxi Membrane Science and Technology Corp., China). UF membranes
with molecular weight cutoffs of 10, 50, and 100 kDa were used in
our study. Finally, alkAL-S was classified into three fractions: Fraction-1
(10–50 kDa), Fraction-2 (20–100 kDa), and Fraction-3
(>100 kDa).

4.4 Structural Property Characterization
4.4.1 Mw Measurements
The Mw distributions of the UF fractions
were determined by aqueous GPC. The calibration standard was polystyrene
sulfonate with a Mw ranging from 2 to
150 kDa. The eluent was a 0.10 M NaNO3 solution introduced
with a flow rate of 0.50 mL/min. All the samples were dissolved and
diluted to achieve a 0.3 wt % concentration using double-distilled
water and filtered with a 0.22 μm filter. The UV absorption
at 280 nm was monitored with a Waters 2487 UV detector (Waters Co.,
Milford, MA).

4.4.2 Functional Group Content
and Elemental Analysis
The phenolic hydroxyl group (−OH)
content of the UF fractions
was detected by the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method.40 The detailed procedure was described in our
previous study.19 The sulfonic group (−SO3H) content of all the samples was determined by an automatic
potentiometric titrator (Type 809 Titrando, Metrohm Corp., Switzerland).5 The elemental analyses of all the fraction samples
were performed by an Elementar vario EL cube.

4.4.3 Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis
The FTIR spectra of
the UF fractions were measured with an Autosystem
XL/I-series/Spectrum2000 instrument (Thermo Nicolet Co., Madison,
WI). The measurement method using the potassium bromide pressed-disk
technique was followed.

4.4.4 1H NMR Spectroscopy
Analysis
The 1H NMR spectra of the three fractions
were recorded
with 30 mg of each sample dissolved in 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 at room temperature by a DRX-400 spectrometer
(Bruker Co., Ettlingen, Germany).

4.4.5 Film-Forming
Properties of the Different
Fractions
The three alkAL-S fractions were spun on a Au surface
with a mass concentration of 1 g/L. The film-forming properties were
studied by AFM.

4.4.6 Contact Angle Measurements
The
wetting properties of the alkAL-S fractions separated from the three
different membranes were measured by drop shape analysis (JC2000C1)21 using a mass concentration of 1 g/L on the Au
surface.

4.5 Adsorption Behavior Measurement
by QCM-D
The adsorption properties of the alkAL-S fractions
on the Au surface
were evaluated by QCM-D (instrument Q-Sense, Vastra Frolunda, Sweden).
The sample solutions, with a mass concentration of 1 g/L under the
salt-free and 0.5 M NaCl conditions, were added with a continuous
flow rate of 150 μL/min into the QCM-D chamber at 25 °C.

4.6 Dispersion Properties
The dispersion
stabilization properties of AL-S and the three alkAL-S fractions in
TiO2 slurries were investigated using Turbiscan Lab Expert
(Formulaction, L’Union, France). A 3 wt % TiO2 powder
was slowly mixed with the 0.5 wt % samples in deionized water. Then,
the TiO2 slurry was stirred at 1000 rpm for 10 min and
measured by Turbiscan. The scan rate was one scan every 2 min, and
the total scan time was 2 h.
