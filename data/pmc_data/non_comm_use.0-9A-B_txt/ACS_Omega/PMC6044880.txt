Injectable
scaffolds are of great interests for skin regeneration
because they can fill irregularly shaped defects through minimally
invasive surgical treatments. In this study, an injectable hydrogel
from biopolymers is developed and its application as wound dressings
is examined. Gelatin-based hydrogels were successfully prepared at
body temperature upon blending with low content of gellan, and the
synergetic effect on the gel formation was carefully characterized
through rheological methods. The electrostatic complexation between
gelatin and gellan was confirmed to contribute a continuous hydrogel
network. The obtained blend hydrogel demonstrates remarkable shear-thinning
and self-recovering properties. For antibacterial purpose, tannic
acid was incorporated into the blend hydrogel. In addition, tannic
acid-loaded blend hydrogel was verified to accelerate the wound healing
on the mice model, significantly than the control groups. Thus, this
paper presents a facile approach without chemical modification to
construct injectable gelatin-based hydrogels, which have great potential
as a wound dressing or tissue scaffold at body temperature.

Introduction
Wound healing is a
complex and coordinated process, which can be
enhanced by a desirable wound dressing material. During the healing
processes, the dressing material can absorb excess exudate, provide
the moist environment for cell regeneration, protect wounds from bacterial
attack, carry healing growth factors, and so on. Various wound dressing
materials, such as hydrogels, hydrocolloids, foams, films, and nanoparticles,
are commercially available and also being investigated.1−14 Among these materials, hydrogels are very attractive for the features
of fluid absorbent, physical barrier, and providing a moist scaffold
for skin regeneration.13,15 However, most hydrogels have
poor mechanical properties, slow degradation, and require a secondary
dressing to adhere on the skin.13,16

Injectable hydrogels
with shear-thinning and self-recovering properties
are of particular interest due to the unique merits of facile operation,
in situ moldability to wound beds, and self-mending their structures
and functionalities after damage.1,5,7−10,15,17−23 For examples, an injectable gel scaffold with interconnected microporous
structure was able to accelerate wound heal by facilitating the cell
migration.7 The building blocks were composed
of peptide RGD-decorated multiarmed poly(ethylene glycol)–vinyl
sulfone and two enzyme substrates.7 Recently,
Guo and co-workers synthesized electroactive injectable hydrogels
with hemostasis and adhesiveness based on functionalized chitosan
and poly(ethylene glycol) and applied them as wound dressings for
cutaneous wound healing.1

Gelatin,
which is derived from collagen, now is commonly used in
tissue engineering due to high abundance, low cost, biocompatibility,
biodegradability, and low antigenicity. As wound dressing materials,
gelatin contains the peptide sequences for the recognition of integrin
receptors in the cells, which are crucial for the cell adhesion.4,24 In addition, gelatin tends to form a nanofiber structure, which
is essential for skin regeneration. The nanofibers, due to large specific
surface area, high porosity, and good permeability, are able to biomimic
the extracellular matrix, which favors the cell adhesion, migration,
and proliferation. Nevertheless, pristine gelatin has low gelling
temperature (below 30 °C), which hampers its application at the
body temperature.25,26 Therefore, gelatin itself is
seldom found for skin regeneration. Strategies including chemical
modification and physical blending have been adopted to tune the gelling
condition of gelatin. For instance, gelatin has been chemically functionalized
with unsaturated methacryloyl groups,25 thiol groups,4 and chemically cross-linked
by cross-linking agents, such as genipin, glutaraldehyde, or periodate-oxidized
alginate.3,11,27 Compared to
chemical modification, physical blending is more appealing due to
eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and industrially capable. However,
up to now, few reports of gelatin-based injectable blend hydrogels
for wound healing have been reported.

In this paper, we introduced
an injectable blend hydrogel, based
on gelatin and gellan, with excellent shear-thinning as well as self-recovering
for wound healing. Gellan, a linear anionic polymer with a tetrasaccharide
repeating sequence (residual β-d-glucose, β-d-glucuronic acid, and α-l-rhamnose in a molar
ratio of 2:1:1), is approved by the FDA as food additives. It has
a gelling behavior, showing a phase diagram dependent of temperature
and/or concentration (from solution, fluid “weak gel”,
to true gel).28−30 Investigation on the gelatin behavior of gellan/gelatin
binary hydrogel was reported by several works;31−33 however, these
studies focus on the functional properties for food application. In
food industry, gellan is applied as an alternative to gelatin, giving
products acceptable by vegetarians and religions that forbid materials
from mammals.28 Herein, gelatin-based blend
hydrogel with very low content of gellan (≤0.5%) was prepared
for wound dressing; the synergetic effect of the gel formation was
carefully characterized by rheological methods, and the gelling mechanism
was proposed. The shear-thinning and self-recovering properties of
the blend hydrogels were found out. Tannic acid (TA), a kind of polyphenol
usually extracted from plants, is biocompatible toward mammalian cells
and active against bacteria; however, a high dose of TA on the wounds
can cause side effects.34 TA was incorporated
into the blend hydrogel. Our previous studies found that gelatin-based
carrier is suitable for the sustained release of polyphenol compounds.35,36 In addition, the effects of blend hydrogel on the wound healing
of dorsal skin were evaluated in a mice model. As it turns out, the
formulation of TA-loaded blend hydrogel is potent to accelerate wound
healing.

Experimental Section
Materials
Gelatin (from porcine
skin, Vetec reagent
grade, Type A, powder, gel strength ∼300 g Bloom) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Gellan gum (used for plant tissue culture) was
obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Japan). Tannic
acid (TA) of analytical reagent was acquired from Aladdin Industrial
Corporation. All aqueous solutions were prepared using Millipore water
(18 MΩ cm, Simplicity Model, Billerica, MA).

Preparation
of Blend Hydrogel
Blend hydrogel of gelatin/gellan
was prepared by mixing gelatin and gellan powder (10 wt % of gelatin
concentration and 0.3 wt % content of gellan) under gentle stirring
and heated at 85 °C in a thermostatic water bath until both biopolymers
were completely dissolved. Finally, the solution was cooled at room
temperature resulting in the formation of hydrogel.

To incorporate
TA into the hydrogels, the hydrogel was first heated, then cooled
to about 50 °C, and TA was added under vortex shaking to avoid
precipitates. The solution was further cooled down at room temperature
after TA was well dispersed. The obtained hydrogel was allowed to
stand for 12 h.

Characterization
Morphology of hydrogels
was uncovered
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) through a Quanta 250 FEG (FEI,
America). Solutions (20 μL) obtained by melting the hydrogel
were dropped onto a silicon slice and cooled at room temperature to
make a gel. Afterward, the sample was lyophilized. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 510P Fourier transform
in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 using KBr pellets,
and the resolution was 2 cm–1. ζ-Potential
measurements were performed on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS at 25 °C.

Rheological Properties
Rheological measurements were
performed on a rheometer (Anton Paar, MCR 302) with parallel plate
geometry (25 mm diameter). The parallel plate was carefully sealed
with silicon oil in case of water evaporation during measurement.
The gap between the probe and the plate was maintained at 1.0 mm for
the time sweep and frequency sweep experiments. Storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″)
as well as the complex viscosity (|η*|) were measured.

Time sweep experiments were conducted at a constant frequency of
1 Hz and strain range of 0.01–1000%. The samples were melted
at 85 °C and then about 1.0 mL of solution was added onto the
plate, which was settled at 70 °C, and a program of temperature
equilibrium at 37 °C was first run and then the time-sweep measurement
was started.

Frequency sweep experiments were conducted at frequency
range of
0.01–10 Hz and at a strain of 0.1% and 37 °C.

For
the temperature sweep experiment, G′
and G″ were monitored as a function of temperature
in the range of 10–45 °C at a heating rate of 1.0 °C
min–1. The samples were melted at 85 °C and
then about 1.0 mL of solution was added onto the plate and settled
at 10 °C for 30 min to obtain a hydrogel. Afterward, the temperature
sweep was conducted at a constant frequency of 1 Hz and strain of
1.0% automated controlled by the machine.

Strain sweep was performed
on samples from 0.1% to a maximum strain
of 1000% to determine the limit of the linear viscoelastic region.
The frequency was set at 1.0 Hz. The viscosity of the hydrogels was
measured as a function of shear rate at 25 °C.

Self-recovering
behavior was evaluated by continuous-step strain
measurements, alternate-step strains of 0.1% for 180 s and large strains
(100, 200, 300, 400, or 500%) for 30 s were applied. The frequency
was set at 1.0 Hz.

Antibacterial Assay
Antibacterial
activity of blend
hydrogel was assessed against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) using an agar disc diffusion test.
An aliquot of log-phase bacterial stock (105–106 CFU) was uniformly spread on an agar plate. Tested samples
were placed on top of the plate, and zones of inhibition were measured
after incubation for 12 h at 37 °C. Sample of TA was prepared
by dropping the TA solution (20 μL, 5 mg/mL) into a sterilized
filter paper (6 mm in diameter). TA-loaded hydrogels with a diameter
of 6 mm were cut by a tip (6 mm in diameter, 1.3 mm in height, the
bulk concentration of TA in the hydrogel is 5 mg/mL).

Wound Healing
The in vivo wound-healing effect was
estimated on a Balb/c mice model. All animal experiments were performed
according to the guidelines, principles, and procedures of the Xiangya
Laboratory Animal Center of Central South University (Changsha, China)
for the care and use of laboratory animals. The mice were randomly
divided into four groups with different treatments (n = 3): phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1×, Hyclone), TA (5 mg/mL),
blend hydrogel, and TA-loaded blend hydrogel. The mice, at 6–8
weeks of age, about 20 g, were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection
with 10% chloral hydrate, and the hair on their backs was shaved.
Then, a cross-shape wound was made by a scissor in length of 10 mm
on the dorsal skin back of the tested mice. Finally, the wounds were
added with 20 μL of samples using a 26-G syringe without secondary
dressing. The wound was photographed by placing a ruler along its
side to monitor the process of wound healing. The body weight was
also recorded at each 4 days.

Results and Discussion
Synergistic
Gel Formation of Gelatin/Gellan Mixtures
Synergistic gelation
behavior was observed in the mixture of gelatin
and gellan at 37 °C. Blends of gelatin and gellan (concentration
of gelatin is 10 wt % and that of gellan 0.3 wt %) form true gels,
which can self-support its own weight at 37 °C (Figure 1, inset image). In contrast,
gelatin and gellan alone could not form gels by visualization (Figure S1). It is found that the mixture of gelatin/gellan
is able to form gels within the range of 0.05–1.5% at body
temperature. Gellan itself is unable to form gels under the same concentration.
However, by increasing the concentration of gellan to 2%, gellan itself
can form gels at body temperature. Therefore, the concentration of
gellan for blend hydrogel is set at 0.3%, where the noncovalent interaction
between gelatin and gellan is preferable.

and the viscoelastic behavior as a function
of frequency (B) of blend hydrogels at 37 °C by rheological measurement.
The inset is the image of blend hydrogel at 37 °C.

The gelation kinetics of blend hydrogel at 37 °C
was further
investigated following a cooling procedure. As shown in Figure 1A, at the beginning, the melted
solution exhibits a very low moduli (G′ is
smaller than 1.0 Pa), though the value of G′
is larger than G″. This result is likely to
be consistent with the characteristic of weak gel, which is actually
a “structure liquid”, like normal solutions.28,37 However, abrupt increase of G′ was observed
at 150 s, indicating the sol–gel transition. At 300 s, G′ increased steadily and reached a plateau at 30
min. The final G′ of blend hydrogel is 1 magnitude
larger than G″, demonstrating the formation
of a true gel. Furthermore, the frequency sweep was performed to evaluate
the viscoelastic behavior at constant strain amplitude and within
a frequency range of 0.01–10 Hz. The hydrogel is stable and
exhibits constant G′ (linear viscoelastic
regime) up to ∼5 Hz (Figure 1B).

Effect of Gellan on the Rheology of Blend
Hydrogels
At 10%, gelatin is unable to form gels at body
temperature (G′ < G″),
whereas is able
to form gels at low temperature (G′ > G″, Figure 2). The crossover point of G′ and G″, termed as the melting temperature, is about 27
°C, as determined by rheometry. For gellan alone, at the low
concentration of 0.3%, it shows solution behavior (G′ < G″) at the temperature ranges
studied (Figures S1 and S2). On addition
of gellan into gelatin hydrogels, a small amount of gellan (<0.5%)
could make a big difference. The obtained blend hydrogels are resistant
to the temperature evolution (G′ is always
larger than G″ in the range of 10–45
°C), indicating that gellan plays an important role in the gelling
process of gelatin. It suggests the intermolecular complex formation
between gelatin and gellan forming another physical cross-linked network,
which is distinct from the network of gelatin alone.

Figure 2 Effect of gellan on G′ (solid symbols)
and G″ (open symbols) as a function of temperature
at a frequency of 1.0 Hz, strain of 0.1%, and a heating rate of 1.0
°C/min.

At 37 °C, G′ is smaller than G″ for
gelatin hydrogel in the absence of gellan,
indicating the solution behavior of gelatin at body temperature. However, G′ of blend hydrogels is steadily increased with
time. At 37 °C, the G′ of blend hydrogel
reaches to 120 Pa after 30 min (Figure 1A). The result suggests the network of blend hydrogel
is less thermosensitive than the network of gelatin alone.

Shear-Thinning
and Self-Recovering Properties of the Hydrogel
Figure 3A shows
the viscosity of blend hydrogel as a function of shear rate. The viscosity
decreases as shear rate elevates. Meanwhile, the shear-thinning behavior
is partly reversible after cessation of the shear. Polysaccharide
with rigid structure (e.g., xanthan gum and gellan) can be utilized
as a modifier for tuning rheological properties of synthetic polymers
and biopolymers.2,37,38 The rigid polysaccharide endows the hydrogel with desirable shear-thinning
properties.

alternate-step strain sweep (C, D) at 37 °C.

The hydrogels can also be extruded by a 26-G (0.45 mm in
outer
diameter) needle and can be moldable to various patterns (Figure S3). The blend hydrogels reassembled into
desired shapes within seconds upon cessation of shear. The result
is in accordance with the rheological test (Figure 3A). The good shear-thinning and self-healing
properties arise from gellan and it can be applied as injectable matrix
for cartilage tissue engineering.39−43

Furthermore, we assessed the self-recovering
of hydrogels by alternate-step
strain measurement. As shown in Figure 3B, G′ of hydrogel is changeless
in the strain range of 0.01–10%, whereas G′ decreases rapidly when the strain is more than 10% showing
that the hydrogel is broken. Hence, high-magnitude strain (100%) was
applied to damage the hydrogel network for 30 s; afterward, a low-magnitude
strain (0.1%) was applied to monitor the recovery of the hydrogel
structure. A strain deformation of 0.1% is within the linear viscoelastic
range. This process was performed in five cycles, as shown in Figure 3C. Under large strain, G′ dramatically decreases and becomes smaller than G″. Notwithstanding, the G′
restores its strength value immediately after strain changes to 0.1%.
In the first cycle, the healing efficiency of G′
is about 62% (121 Pa vs initial 194 Pa) in first 30 s and the healing
efficiency of G′ is about 89% (172 Pa vs initial
194 Pa) after a total 180 s. In the following cycles, the healing
efficiency of G′ reaches to 98% (169 Pa vs
initial 172 Pa). The data proves that the blend hydrogel has excellent
self-healing ability.

Furthermore, by applying increasingly
strains (up to 500%) to damage
the hydrogels, the restoring process of G′
is almost the same as that by constant strains of 100%. Mechanism
of self-recovering (also termed as self-healing) relies on the reversibility
of the cross-links, which be classified into two approaches, dynamic
covalent and noncovalent. In the blend hydrogels, the good self-healing
property of blend hydrogels is attributable to the noncovalent bonds
of building blocks, such as hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions.44

Gelation Mechanism
Complexation
of gellan with gelatin
was investigated by FTIR spectra (Figure 4); most of the bands for blend hydrogel are
similar as those for gelatin, which supports that gellan is fully
blended with gelatin. The peak at 1630 cm–1 for
the amide I band of gelatin shifts to 1631 cm–1 after
gellan blending, which indicates the occurrence of electrostatic complexation
between gellan and gelatin.45 In addition,
the peak of absorption bands around 3400 cm–1 (contributions
of −OH and −NH2 stretching) was also examined.
Blend hydrogel exhibits a lower frequency band centered at 3423 cm–1, whereas at 3438 cm–1 and 3434
cm–1 for gelatin and gellan, respectively. The peak
shifts to lower wavenumbers due to the dehydration of polymer chains.46,47 The results suggest the noncovalent interaction between gelatin
and gellan.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of gelatin (a), gellan (b), and blend hydrogels (c).

To determine the driving force
for the formation of blend hydrogels,
the ζ-potentials of the two biopolymer solutions were measured
as a function of pH (Figure 5). Gellan displays negative charges over the whole pH range
studied, and the absolute values of ζ-potential gradually decreased
as pH decreased, which can be attributed to protonation of the carboxyl
groups of the β-d-glucuronic acid of gellan molecules.
However, the ζ-potential of gelatin is positive when pH is smaller
than 7 and negative when higher than 7, displaying an isoelectronic
point (pI) between pH 7 and pH 8. The result is in good agreement
with the structure information provided by the supplier (gelatin of
type A has the pI of 7–9). These results show that gellan and
gelatin form electrostatic complexes due to which they have opposite
charges at neutral or acidic pH values.

Figure 5 ζ-Potentials of
gelatin and gellan as a function of pH.

To understand the electrostatic interaction, blend hydrogel
was
further prepared at pH 4.0 where the charges of two biopolymers are
changed. At pH 4.0, the blend hydrogel become fragile and it is found
that the G′ of the blend hydrogel obtained
at pH 4.0 is smaller than that obtained at the initial pH (Figure S4). At pH 4.0, gelatin carries more positive
charges than at the initial pH (about pH 5.4), while gellan has less
negative charges. By contrast, at acidified pH closing to the pKa (pKa of gellan
is about 3.5),48 and the intra- and intermolecular
interaction of gellan itself will increase, which may destroy the
complexation of gelatin and gellan. While at pH values apart from
the pKa, the intermolecular interaction
between positively charged gelatin with gellan is dominant, leading
to stronger gels.

By using SEM, we observed the blend hydrogel
has interconnected
porous structures as expected (Figure 6). The low incorporation of gellan doesn’t change
the morphology of gelatin hydrogels. The blend hydrogels are made
of nanofibers with pore size of 2–3 μm. Nanofiber-based
wound dressings have drawn great attention due to their merits of
large specific surface area, high porosity, and good permeability,
which promoting cell adhesion migration and proliferation.6,49 The porous structure is beneficial for rapid diffusion of nutrients
throughout the network, improving the efficacy in cell attachment,
proliferation, and migration.7,50,51

image of the blend hydrogel.

Influence of TA on the Rheology Properties of Hydrogel
Recent
studies showed protein–polysaccharide electrostatic
hydrogels are of interest to assemble functional gels due to the method
not requiring any denaturation or chemical cross-linking as opposed
to protein hydrogels.52 In our studies,
each component alone is unable to form gels, whereas the blends of
them do form gels under the experimental conditions. Thus, the blend
hydrogels have great potential to develop as functional biomaterials
to incorporate bioactive molecules.

TA was directly incorporated
into the blend hydrogel during the cooling process close to 50 °C.
TA has strong binding with gelatin. Homogeneous mixing is finely controlled
by vortex shaking to avoid precipitates. G′
of blend hydrogel after TA loading is higher than before due to the
cross-linking effect of TA (Figure S5).
Furthermore, the shear-thinning properties are also well maintained
(Figure S5). To understand the supramolecular
interaction of TA with gellan and gelatin, we attempted to cross-link
the two polymers by TA. Nevertheless, it is found that neither gelatin
(10%) nor gellan (0.3%) is able to form hydrogels at 37 °C in
the presence of TA up to a concentration of 40 mg/mL (Figure S6). The results suggest that the binding
between TA and gelatin or gellan cannot destroy the main structure
of the blend hydrogel, probably due to the low mass ratio of TA to
gelatin (1:20). In our studies, a small ratio of TA is applied to
avoid macroscopic separation, similar to films composed of gelatin
and TA.53 Previously, we found that soluble
polydisperse particles are formed at low ratios of tea polyphenol
to gelatin.36 It further suggests that
the blend hydrogel is an excellent reservoir for other active substances,
and cells as well.

Antibacterial Properties
An ideal
wound dressing should
protect the wound bed from pathogenic bacteria. The biopolymer-based
hydrogel is fragile to bacteria, which can induce inflammation and
cause unfavorable smell due to fermentation. TA exhibits a broad antibacterial
spectrum against either Gram-negative bacteria or Gram-positive bacteria.
The bacterial growth can be inhibited by TA using a multiple mode
of action involving destabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane, inhibition
of extracellular microbial enzymes, deprivation of the substrates
required for microbial growth or direct action on microbial metabolism
through inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, and so on54−56 Hence, herbal medicine TA can reduce the occurrence of antibacterial
resistance, which is a superiority over chemical antibiotics. Herein,
TA-loaded blend hydrogel was prepared and its antibacterial activities
were evaluated by the agar disc diffusion assay. Gram-negative bacterium
(E. coli), Gram-positive bacterium
(S. aureus), and drug-resistant bacteria
(MRSA) were used as model bacteria. The results showed that the TA-loaded
hydrogel inhibits the growth of all bacteria including S. aureus, E. coli, and MRSA, although the inhibition zone of TA-loaded hydrogel is
smaller than that of TA solution (Figure 7). As a negative control, blend hydrogel
has no inhibition activity on bacteria growth. The results indicate
that TA was sustained released from the blend hydrogel and exerted
long-term antibacterial efficacy. To verify the sustained release
property of TA-loaded hydrogel, in vitro release was performed using
a transdermal diffusion apparatus according to the paper57 and described in Supporting Information. The result confirms that TA-loaded hydrogel has
a sustained release of TA (Figure S7).
It is reported that complexation of polyphenols with gelatin can afford
adequate protection for gelatin against microbial degradation, which
plays an important role in the tanning industry.58 Owing to the antibacterial properties, the blend hydrogel
can reduce the growth of bacteria and prolong the shelf-life in storage
and half-life for therapy.

Wound Healing
The wound healing efficacy of the hydrogels
was evaluated in a mice model. Four groups of mice (treatment by PBS,
TA, hydrogel, and TA-loaded hydrogel) were tested. The wounds were
created into full-thickness cross-shape with about 10 mm in length.
The wounds were treated by the test samples only once and without
any other dressing put on the skin across the whole experiments. On
observation days, the wounds were recorded (Figure 8A). The change of length of wounds and body
weight was plotted as a function of time, as shown in Figure 8B,C. For TA-loaded hydrogel
group, the wounds reduced remarkably and completely diminished on
the 12th day. No scar was found, and the skin was fully covered with
hair. On the 12th day, the healing rate is 100% in terms of the decrease
ratio of the length of wounds. The area of wound closure was also
measured; TA-loaded hydrogel group has a fast recovery in the index
of area compared with other groups (Figure S8).

Figure 8 TA-loaded blend hydrogel promotes wound healing in a Balb/c mouse
model. (A) Representative images of wound closure during 12 day experiments.
Quantification of wound closure (B) and body weight (C) of mice during
the treatment.

In contrast, the group
treated by TA recovers slowly. On the 12th
day, the healing rate was 71% and scar was still observed. Furthermore,
an inflammatory response was indicated by observing fluids exuded
from the wounds. Also, the body weight of mice treated by TA was gradually
decreased. Total tannins from Entada phaseoloides (L.) Merr. were reported exerting a wound-healing promoting effect,
and the concentration of tannins is about 9.38–37.50 μg/mL.
When the concentration was higher than 37.5 μg/mL, tannins inhibited
the collagen synthesis in NIH3T3 cells.34 In this paper, 5.0 mg/mL of TA is applied as control. High concentration
of TA on the one hand could promote wound shrinkage but on the other
hand could hinder the healing rate by inhibiting the collagen synthesis;
the results were consistent with those observed.34 In Figure S8, the area of wound
of TA group on the 4th day was even larger than the beginning, which
probably results from the negative effect of high concentration of
TA.

For PBS group, on the 12th day, the healing rate is about
81% in
terms of the length ratio of wounds. Saline can promote the healing
process in part by the faster contraction, similar to the phenomena
found in the literature.12 For the TA-free
blend hydrogel group, the healing process was faster in comparison
to the PBS group. In our study, blend hydrogel is more efficacious
than PBS for healing (healing rate is 88% on the 12th day for blend
hydrogel), implying the role of hydrogel matrix, where gelatin has
a well-established effect on cell migration and proliferation.4,24 Therefore, TA-loaded hydrogel not only provides a sustained drug
delivery for minimizing the adverse effect of TA, but also facilitates
skin repair in a cooperative way.

In hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
and Masson’s trichrome
staining, the epidermal thickness, skin tissue formation, and collagen
deposition were evaluated (Figure 9). In TA-loaded hydrogel group, epidermal thickness
was 60 μm, which was significantly higher than other groups.
Scoring results of wound granulation tissue formation were 5, 4, 5,
and 8 for groups of PBS, TA, hydrogel, and TA-loaded hydrogel, respectively.
TA-loaded hydrogel group scores the highest value in the granulation
tissue formation. In the TA-loaded hydrogel group, collagen fibers
with parallel arrangement are more accumulated and collagen content
is also higher than other groups. In addition, more hair follicles
are observed. The results indicated that TA-loaded hydrogel group
has very effective skin regeneration and function restoration over
other groups.

at 12 day wound healing.

To gain insight of wound healing, we examined the cell cytotoxicity
and cell migration of blend hydrogels. L929 cells treated by blend
hydrogel are growing better than the control groups, showing higher
cell viability (Figure S9), suggesting
the good biocompatibility of blend hydrogels. Furthermore, cell proliferation
and migration are revealed across the scratched area by microscopy
images after 24 h incubation (Figure 10). The cells in the control group are more confluent
than those in the blend hydrogel group. The migration of the cells
occurs when the hydrogel is gradually dissolved during incubation.
The in vitro results imply that the blend hydrogel can be slowly degraded
in vivo, and the erosion can create space for cell growth and migration.

dotted lines indicate the wound scratch created using a pipette tip.

The investigation of wound healing
by blend hydrogel is preliminary,
and we further found the hydrogel did not show the same effect on
a round-shape of full-thick wounds (data not shown). The hydrogel
gradually lost water and adhered fiercely on the wound beds during
the healing, which delayed the healing process to some extent. The
obstacles might be circumvented by spaying saline or water, or covering
with other occlusive dressings.

Conclusions
Blending
with gellan is suitable to make gelatin a true gel under
body temperature. The mechanism of gelation is mainly attributed to
the electrostatic complexation. In particular, the blend hydrogel
exhibits good injectability with self-recovering property. The blend
formulation not only improves the thermal gelation property of gelatin,
but also makes dressings capable of fully conforming to wound beds.
The blend hydrogel is beneficial for sustained delivery of TA and
promoting cell adhesion and migration, supported by animal experiments.
Altogether, this unique blend hydrogel has a bright future for wound
healing and/or tissue engineering.
