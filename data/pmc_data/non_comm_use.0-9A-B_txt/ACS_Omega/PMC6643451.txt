This
work describes a new, equipment-free, generic method for the
determination of sulfur-containing compounds that is based on their
ability to slow down the photoreduction kinetics of gold ions to gold
nanoparticles. The method involves tracking the time required for
a red coloration to appear in the tested sample, indicative of the
formation of gold nanoparticles, and compare the measured time relative
to a control sample in the absence of the target analyte. The method
is applicable with minimal and simple steps requiring only two solutions
(i.e., a buffer and a gold solution), a source of light (UV or visible),
and a timer. The method responds to a large variety of sulfur-containing
compounds including thiols, thioesters, disulfides, thiophosphates,
metal–sulfur bonds, and inorganic sulfur and was therefore
applied to the determination of a variety of compounds such as dithiocarbamate
and organophosphorous pesticides, biothiols, pharmaceutically active
compounds, and sulfides in different samples such as natural waters
and wastewater, biological fluids, and prescription drugs. The analytical
figures of merit of the method include satisfactory sensitivity (quantitation
limits at the low μM levels), good recoveries (from 93 to 109%),
and satisfactory reproducibility (from 4.8 to 9.8%). The method is
easily adoptable to both laboratory settings and nonlaboratory conditions
for quantitative and semiquantitative analysis, respectively, is user-friendly
even for the minimally trained user, and can be performed with limited
resources at low cost.

Introduction
One
of the most salient features of noble-metal nanoparticles (NPs)
is their ability to undergo intense colorimetric transitions in response
to a change in their localized surface plasmon resonance due to size
or shape modifications.1 This property
has driven research in the use of nanoparticles as labels for a wide
range of optical sensing and analyte-recognition events,2,3 with improved sensitivity, selectivity, and multiplexing capabilities
as compared to conventional molecular probes.4

The key to the development of nanoparticle-based optical sensing
platforms is to design nanoparticles that disperse or aggregate in
the presence of the target analyte.5 This
is usually accomplished by tethering appropriate analyte–receptor
molecules on the NPs surface, analyte-mediated removal of stabilizers
from the NPs surface, or analyte-driven destruction of interparticle
bonds.6 Another approach is based on the
ability of the analytes to modulate the morphological properties of
nanoparticles during their formation and, thus, gives rise to specific
spectral changes as compared to nanoparticle suspensions prepared
in the absence of the analytes. This is accomplished when the target
analyte can interact with the precursor (noble) metal ions before
they are reduced to NPs. Such examples are the formation and growth
of noble-metal NPs as a function of the reducing power of phenolic
acids,7 antioxidant compounds,8 and b-agonists,9 the
inhibitory effect of DNA bases in the formation of AuNPs due to their
strong coordination with gold ions,10 and
the detection of mercury based on the formation of an amalgam between
mercury and gold.11 Enzymatic reactions
further expand the scope of analyte-modulated NPs formation by enabling
the detection of “inert” analytes that show no affinity
for metal nanoparticles or their precursor metal ions.12 For example, alcohol dehydrogenase has been
used to generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, which
can act as a reducing agent, changing the shape and size of AuNPs.13 In the same line of thinking, oxidase-based
biosensors have been employed to mediate the catalytic formation of
gold nanoparticles through the reduction of AuCl4– by enzymatically produced hydrogen peroxide.14 Another popular application is the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine
by acetylcholine esterase (AChE) to produce thiocholine, which acts
both as a reducing and a capping agent for AuCl4– and AuNPs, respectively. Inhibitors of AChE (such as nerve gases
or organophosphorous pesticides) can therefore be indirectly determined
by measuring the inhibition of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis to thiocholine.15−18 In all these approaches, a reducing agent, that is either separately
added to the solution or produced in situ from the enzymatic reaction
of the analyte, is necessary to ensure the reduction of noble-metal
ions to their respective nanoparticle species.

Except reducing
agents, several studies have shown that ultraviolet
and visible light can be also used to generate metal nanoparticles
in the presence of appropriate molecules that can bind to metal ions
and act as photosensitizers.19−23 However, only a limited number of studies have exploited this principle
for the development of new sensing strategies, i.e., using the influence
of the target analytes in the photochemical formation of NPs. Most
of these studies focus on silver ions due to their easy photoreduction
under UV or visible light. For example, Jung et al. (2013) used the
photoinduced reduction of silver ion bound to DNA bases for the detection
of bacterial genomic DNA.24 Our group reported
the determination of dissolved organic matter in natural waters based
on the formation of silver nanoparticles via photostimulated reduction
of silver ions by humic and fulvic acids under UV light.25 Recently, we have also exploited the influence
of biothiols in the UV-light-mediated photochemical reduction of silver
halide nanocrystals for the determination of biologically relevant
thiol species (cysteine, glutathione, and homocysteine) in body fluids.26 Pu et al. (2018) reported a biomolecule-templated
photochemical synthesis of silver nanoparticles and demonstrated its
use for the statistical discrimination among different proteins.27 With regard to gold ions, only one study, to
our knowledge, has been reported to exploit the influence of the target
analytes in the photochemical reduction of gold ions. Specifically,
biothiols were found to inhibit the formation of AuNPs, produced from
the combined effect of UV light and tryptophan as the reducing agent.
The inhibition was measured spectrophotometrically and used for the
determination of thiols in human plasma.28

In this work, we report a novel nanotechnology-based method
that
exploits, for the first time, the kinetics of the photochemical reduction
of gold ions to gold nanoparticles for sensing applications. The method
is based on recording the time delay in the photoinduced formation
of gold nanoparticles in the presence of sulfur-containing compounds
using a simple chronometer and the unaided eye as detectors (Figure 1). A wide range of
organic and inorganic compounds with different sulfur moieties such
as thiols, thioesters, disulfides, thiophosphates, metal–sulfur
bonds, and inorganic sulfur were found to slow down the photoreduction
kinetics of gold ions both under ultraviolet and visible light. On
the basis of this principle, we developed an equipment-free analytical
protocol for sulfur-containing compounds and demonstrated its practical
utility for a variety of sensing applications.

Results and Discussion
The formation
and controlled synthesis of gold nanoparticles from
aqueous gold solutions under the influence of light offers some distinct
advantages over chemical reduction (bottom-up) methods:29 (a) the reduction of gold ions is carried without
using strong reducing agents (e.g., borohydride) or harsh conditions
(e.g., boiling of the solutions) and (b) irradiation diffuses throughout
the entire mass of the solution, thus reduction occurs uniformly under
controlled reaction rate. Various light sources have been tested for
that purpose (such as UV, sunlight, laser, γ-irradiation), but
UV irradiation is the most frequently employed because it matches
the absorption band of Au3+ (about 323 nm).20,23

Previous studies have shown that when AuCl4– is irradiated with UV light, Au3+ is first
excited by
the incoming radiation and then reduced to Au2+, which
is unstable and disproportionates quickly to form Au+ and
Au3+.20,23 Then, Au+ either absorbs
another photon and photoreduced to Au0 or slowly disproprionates
to from Au0 and Au2+. The gold atoms, Au0, can get together to form gold nuclei and AuNPs, which may
further catalyze the disproportionation reactions.20,23 All these reactions require the presence of an additive, which serves
to accelerate or trigger the formation of AuNPs through different
chemical routes.16,17,20,23,29 Surfactants,
polymers, ethylene glycol, citrate, etc. have been used as sensitizers
of the photochemical reduction of gold ions to AuNPs.

In this
work, we report that sulfur-containing compounds can not
only affect the photochemical formation and growth of AuNPs but also
slow down the photoreduction kinetics of AuNPs formation. Figure 2 and the respective
UV–vis absorbance spectra (inset graphs) show the kinetics
of the photochemical formation of AuNPs under UV light irradiation
in the absence and presence of cysteine as a model sulfur-containing
compound. A video demonstration of the process in an aqueous solution
containing 50.0 μM of cysteine under ambient daylight is given
in the Supporting Information (the video
is at actual speed but cropped from 1:43 to 3.06 min). All the experiments
were carried out in the presence of citrate, which was necessary to
sensitize and accelerate the photoreduction of gold to AuNPs because
no AuNPs were formed in the absence of citrate, even at longer irradiation
times, i.e., >30 min under 40 W of irradiation at 254 nm. Citrate
could sensitize the photochemical formation of AuNPs either due to
the photoreduction of citrate to acetone-1,3-dicarboxylate and free
electrons, which reduce Aum+ (m = 1, 2, 3) to Au0 or due to the direct excitation
of the citrate–Au3+ complex that could reduce Au3+ through electron-transfer mechanisms.23

in the presence of 200.0 μM cysteine. Experimental conditions:
pH 4 (citrate citric acid buffer, 8.0 mM), λ = 254 nm, and 40
W.

Optimization of Gold Photoreduction
The photochemical
formation and growth of AuNPs from gold chloride solutions is a kinetic
phenomenon that continues even after exposure to irradiation has been
stopped. Depending on the experimental conditions (intensity of UV
irradiation, concentration of gold ions, presence of additives, etc.),
the formation and growth of AuNPs may continue for several hours after
stopping the irradiation until reaching an equilibrium.20 This phenomenon is not a limitation in our time-based
assay because the analytical signal is the time required for a colored
solution to appear; once the color becomes evident, the formation
of AuNPs is no longer monitored. To optimize the experimental conditions
of the assay, however, we used the absorbance of the solutions to
obtain (absorbance) measurements at a fixed time for all optimization
experiments. Therefore, the influence of incubation time (after UV
irradiation has been stopped) was the first parameter investigated.
We measured the absorbance of the blank and sample solutions at 525
nm after exposure for 1.5 min under UV light (254 nm, 40 W) and incubation
in the dark at room temperature for various time intervals. We irradiated
the samples for 1.5 min because according to the kinetic curves of Figure 2, both the sample
and the blank solutions show no significant increase in the absorbance
values, whereas at longer irradiation times, the absorbance of the
blank increases abruptly. In addition, the samples were kept in dark
to avoid exposure to ambient light, which can also induce the photoreduction
of AuCl4–.21 According to the results of Figure 3a, the net analytical signal (i.e., absorbance intensity
of the sample minus the absorbance intensity of the blank solution)
increases rapidly after 5 min of incubation at room temperature (∼25
°C) but dramatically decreases at longer times. This pattern
is obtained due to the faster formation of AuNPs in the blank sample
in the first 4 min of incubation, whereas in the presence of cysteine,
the formation of AuNPs slows down and becomes apparent only after
6 min (Figure 3a, inset);
hence, the difference in the net absorbance value reaches its maximum
after 5 min and decreases thereafter. When the same experiments were
performed in cold conditions (i.e., 4 °C), the reaction rate
decreased and the absorbance signal reached its maximum value after
12 min of incubation. These data suggest that temperature also affects
the kinetics of gold photoreduction. On the basis of these findings,
all the absorbance measurements were performed under fixed conditions
that involve exposure to UV light (40 W, 254 nm) for 1.5 min and incubation
at room temperature protected from ambient light exposure for 5 min.

Figure 3 Optimization
of gold photoreduction in the presence of 50.0 μM
cysteine as a model sulfur-containing compound and citrate as photosensitizer
at λ = 254 nm (40 W). Effects of (a) reaction time in the dark
(after UV irradiation), (b) AuCl4– concentration,
(c) solution pH, and (d) temperature on the net absorbance signal
intensity (ΔA) calculated as the difference
between the absorbance signal of the sample and the absorbance signal
of the blank at λ = 530 nm.

Following the optimization of reaction kinetics, we studied
the
influence of AuCl4– and citrate concentration,
pH, temperature, and wavelength of irradiation. The results of Figure 3b show that the net
absorbance signal increases significantly at AuCl4– concentration up to 1.0 mM due to a significant increase
in the absorbance of the blank solution (not shown). At higher gold
concentrations, the absorbance decreases dramatically for both the
sample and the blank solutions possibly because a higher amount of
energy is required to photoreduce the large concentration of gold
ions. Therefore, 1 mM of AuCl4– was used
throughout the experiments.

The concentration of citrate ions,
necessary to sensitize the photochemical
reduction of gold ions was found to depend on light intensity. A higher
amount of citrate was required with decreasing light intensity (i.e.,
increasing irradiation wavelength). In the working conditions (40
W of light intensity at 254 nm, in the presence of 50.0 μM of
cysteine), the optimum citrate ion concentrations was 5.0 mM, whereas
at higher citrate concentrations, the net absorbance signal intensity
declined possibly because citrate accelerated the photoreduction of
gold ion solutions.23

With regard
to pH, the acidic values (pH 3.5) were found to produce
the best results (Figure 3c). As the pH increases above the optimum (pH ≥ 3.5),
the net absorbance signal intensity exhibits a behavior, which seems
to be related to the pKa of the predominant
cysteine species. Specifically, the signal decreases to zero at pH
5, which is close to the isoelectric point of cysteine (i.e., 5.14)
and the pKa of citric acid (i.e., 4.74).
Then, the signal is reversed (i.e., the absorbance signal intensity
of the sample is higher than the absorbance signal intensity of the
blank) and gradually decreases up to the value of pH 8.0, which coincides
with the acid dissociation constant of the sulfhydryl group (pKa2 = 8.18). At pH above 8, the signal remains
relatively stable. The fact that the signal of the sample becomes
higher than that of the blank at pH values higher than 5 may suggest
that photoreduction of AuCl4– ions is
enhanced in the presence of charged species of cysteine and citrate
probably due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer reactions with the
predominant gold species at these pH values (possibly [AuCl(OH)3]− and [Au(OH)4]− ).30

Temperature was also found
to play a significant role in the photoreduction
of AuCl4–, both in the presence and the
absence of cysteine (Figure 3d). When the samples were irradiated at temperatures higher
than room temperature, the net analytical signal (ΔA at λ = 530 nm) decreased, suggesting that temperature accelerated
the reduction of AuCl4– ions. We attributed
these observations to the presence of citrate, which is known to be
an efficient reducing agent of gold at elevated temperatures. Therefore,
all the experiments were performed at room temperature.

We then
sought the optimum wavelength of irradiation at wavelengths
in the UV region (254, 312, and 365 nm) and under visible light (i.e.,
artificial and room light). We observed that the photoreduction was
feasible at all wavelengths, including ambient light, but longer irradiation
times were required with increasing wavelength (i.e., lower intensity).
For example, the formation of AuNPs in the presence of 200.0 μM
cysteine at room temperature and 40 W of UV irradiation at 254 nm
was evident after 6 min (Figure 2). When the same experiment was performed under room
light, it needed more than 1 h to obtain a measurable signal. The
experimental conditions and the selected (optimum) values are summarized
in Table S1.

Effect of UV Intensity
The influence of irradiation
intensity (from 8 to 40 W at 254 nm) as a function of cysteine concentration
was investigated under the optimum experimental conditions using time
as a metering unit. We monitored the formation of AuNPs with the unaided
eye (against a white background to facilitate the observation of the
colorimetric changes) and recorded the time required for a colored
solution to appear in the blank and the sample solutions. The timer
was manually started with exposure to irradiation and stopped upon
the appearance of a faint red–purple coloration indicative
of the formation of AuNPs. The time required for a colored solution
to appear as a function of cysteine concentration and for different
UV intensities is shown in Figure S1. These
results show that (a) the irradiation time, necessary for AuNPs to
produce an optically observable coloration, decreases with increasing
UV intensity and (b) the kinetics of AuNPs formation follow a linear
pattern with increasing cysteine concentration. We also observed that
the sensitivity of the method changes with irradiation intensity;
at lower light intensity (8 and 16 W), the method exhibits higher
sensitivity, whereas at higher light intensity (24, 32 and 40 W),
the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we concluded that any irradiation
intensity can be employed for the measurements, but dilute samples
(containing low concentrations of sulfur-containing compounds) can
be more conveniently analyzed using lower UV intensities to enable
easier discrimination and measurement of time. On the other hand,
concentrated samples (that contain high concentrations of sulfur-containing
compounds) can be analyzed under higher UV intensity to accelerate
the photoreduction kinetics and reduce the analysis time.

Timing and
Signal Acquisition
Although observations
with the unaided eye are simple to perform, they are not practical
for stand-alone applications because the user’s attention must
be fixed on the assay while it is running, so a user cannot do multitasking,
e.g., analyzing multiple samples or running other tests in parallel,
is not possible. In addition, it requires observation of colorimetric
changes, which may be influenced by the experience of the user or
its ability to perceive color. In these cases, the method may be limited
to semi-quantitative measurements. Coupling the time-based readout
with a digital camera for the measurement of the run time of the assay
can be used to overcome these limitations and provide a more accurate
timing of the observed colorimetric transitions.

To compare
the accuracy of the measurements between manual and video timing,
we prepared a calibration plot with increasing cysteine concentration
from 0 to 200 μM and recorded the time delay in the formation
of AuNPs both manually (with the unaided eye as detector) and with
a use of mobile phone camera. Video inspection enabled us to monitor
the assay time more easily because it did not require continues supervision
of the reactions, but the calculated net signal response (i.e., time
delay between the blank and the sample solutions) was similar to that
recorded by the unattended eye because in both methods, the change
in the color of the solutions was observed optically by eye inspection.
To minimize user intervention and accomplish more accurate timing,
we obtained video stills (as jpeg images) at different time intervals
and measured the color intensity (as RGB values) in each image using
digital image colorimetry. Figure 4 shows the mean gray intensity obtained from the digital
images (using the Image J software) at equally spaced time intervals
of 1 min for the blank and a sample solution. The change in the slope
of the curves signifies the formation of AuNPs and the distance on
the x-axis the net signal response (i.e., the time
delay in the formation of AuNPs in the blank and the sample solution).
As we can observe, the time delay in the formation of AuNPs is calculated
to be 1 min, which is higher than that observed with the unaided eye
(i.e., 0.6 min). Therefore, this approach could increase the usability
of the time-based approach in some settings and provide some improvement
to both sensitivity and reproducibility.

formation as determined using digital
image colorimetry. Inset photo: images at time intervals of 1 min.

Response to Sulfur-Containing
Compounds and Selectivity
The kinetics of the photochemical
reduction of gold ions in the presence
of various sulfur-containing compounds was investigated by irradiating
aqueous AuCl4– solutions containing 5.0
mM of citrate as photosensitizer. The obtained dose–response
plots (time vs concentration) are shown in Figure 5 for a variety of sulfur-containing compounds
such as pesticides (dithiocarbamates and organophosphorous), biothiols
(cysteine, glutathione, and homocysteine), sulfur-containing drugs
(inhibitors of metallo-lactamases), and sulfide ions. All these compounds
contain a variety of sulfur-containing moieties (see Table S2), which can bind to gold or gold nanoparticles such
as thiols (S–H), thioesters (P–S), disulfides (S–S),
metal–sulfur bonds (Me–S), sulfide (S2–), and thiophosphates (P=S) (the latter bonds are able to
interact weakly with metal ions via coordinative interactions).31,32 The analytical figures of merit for each compound (detection limits,
repeatability, and linear range) are also gathered in Table S2. With the exception of pesticides, which
typically exist at lower concentration levels in environmental samples,
the method offers adequate sensitivity for the determination of sulfur-containing
compounds in a variety of samples without the need for separate extraction
or preconcentration steps.

Figure 5 Calibration plots for various sulfur-containing
compounds. All
the curves were obtained at 40 W irradiation intensity at λ
= 254 nm except for the thiram curve, which was obtained at 8 W (λ
= 254 nm), and the sulfide curve, which was obtained under artificial
light in a pooled water sample prepared by mixing four commercial
bottled waters.

From the above discussion,
it is made clear that the method is
not selective for a specific class of sulfur-containing compounds,
but it may respond to a variety of compounds containing sulfur moieties.
However, each sample matrix may contain a different class of compounds.
For example, the predominant sulfur-containing compounds in biological
fluids are aminothiols, whereas environmental samples may contain
dithiocarbamate and organophosphorous pesticides. In that regard,
the method can be used to selectivity determine the total concentration
of a specific class of compounds in the tested sample. This is typical
in all the assays that are based on the colorimetric changes induced
in AuNP suspensions by sulfur-containing compounds. Moreover, from
the slopes of the calibration plots of Figure 5 and Table S2,
it can be inferred that the analytical response to each sulfur-containing
compound is not identical. This observation could be used to qualitatively
discriminate among different sulfur-containing compounds in a tested
sample. For example, the slopes of the calibration curves for organophosphorous
and dithiocarbamate pesticides are different for each pesticide category,
thus enabling to obtain a qualitative evidence of the presence of
either pesticides species in the real samples. Similarly, the method
could be used to assess the authenticity of drugs by comparing the
slope of the curve obtained with a standard pharmaceutical compound
or a genuine drug to that of an unknown drug sample (using variable
dilutions of both the standard and the unkown samples to obtain different
concentration levels), and obtain qualitative evidence of the adulteration
of the active ingredient or the presence of counterfeit additives.
With regard to biothiols, the calibration functions of cysteine and
homocysteine, which are the most abundant aminothiol species in blood
plasma (150–300 and 5–15 μM, respectively),33 have similar slope and intercept values; therefore,
the total concentration of cysteine and homocysteine can be determined
from one calibration function without the loss of accuracy. Further
improvement in selectivity can be accomplished by means of appropriate
extraction methods, which can relieve the sample from coexisting species
and imbue the assay with a high selectivity against a specific class
of compounds or analytes.34

Selectivity
is also influenced by the matrix of the sample. Because
the method employs Au ions and light to accomplish the photochemical
formation of AuNPs, selectivity may be influenced by coexisting species
that may complex Au ions or absorb the incident irradiation. This
may affect the selectivity of the assay and produce false-positive
or false-negative results. A specific experimental protocol, depending
on the sample matrix, was therefore optimized and developed for each
analyte and sample matrix. Details from the optimization study and
the optimized experimental procedure for each analyte and sample matrix
are given in the Supporting Information.

Method Application and Validation
The utility of the
method in the analysis of the real samples was examined for (a) the
determination of sulfur-containing active ingredients in drugs, (b)
the determination of total biothiols in artificial body fluids, (c)
the determination of pesticides in environmental waters, and (d) the
determination of sulfide in treated wastewater samples. The results
from the analysis of different samples for various sulfur-containing
compounds are gathered in Table 1. The recoveries were lying between 93 and 109% depending
on the sample matrix and target analytes with good reproducibility.
These data indicate that the developed assay can be reliably used
for the instrument-free determination of a variety of sulfur-containing
compounds in different matrices using a simple chronometer and the
unaided eye as detectors.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have described the development of a new nanotechnology-based
approach that uses, for the first time, the inhibitory effect of sulfur-containing
compounds in the kinetics of the photochemical formation of AuNPs.
The method involves tracking the time required for AuNPs to appear
in the tested sample, compared to that in a blank solution. On the
basis of this principle, a general analytical protocol was devised
and appropriately modified for each sample matrix and target analyte
to enable the determination of a wide variety of sulfur-containing
compounds of environmental, pharmaceutical, and biological interest.
The experimental protocol (and its modifications) described herein
are simple to perform and do not require instrumental detectors because
they can be operated by the unaided eye using a simple timer. The
only requirement is the ability of the user to see color and/or the
ability to count (i.e., time) to measure the quantity of the analyte.
The method could be fieldable because it does not require an external
light source; ambient light is well suited for triggering the photochemical
formation of AuNPs. The use of a camera can integrate multitasking
capabilities and further improve the accuracy and the reproducibility
of the measurements.

Experimental Section
Reagents
All the
reagents were of analytical grade
unless otherwise stated. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate trihydrate (min.
99.9%), PESTANAL analytical standards of dithiocarbamate fungicides
(Thiram and Propineb) and organophosphate pesticides (Phorate and
Methamidophos), zofenopril calcium, arginine, asparagine, aspartic
acid, l-cysteine, cystine, dl-homocysteine, glutamine,
glutamic acid, ammonium chloride, lactic acid, magnesium sulfate,
magnesium chloride hexahydrate, sodium sulfide, sodium chloride, sodium
sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, potassium
dihydrogen phosphate, citric acid, tri-sodium citrate, potassium chloride,
calcium chloride dehydrate, uric acid, d(+)-glucose, and
creatinine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). l-Glutathione (reduced), meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, d-(−)-penicillamine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and captopril were obtained from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe,
Germany). Glycine, histidine, lysine, and valine were supplied by
Serva Electrophoresis GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany). Finally, urea (>99.5%)
was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech AB (Uppsala, Sweden) and HPLC-grade
solvent from Fischer Scientific (Loughborough, U.K.).

Equipment
We used a UV illumination chamber (Vilber
Lourmat Bio-Link BLX Crosslinker) (4 W cm–2) to
illuminate the solutions with UV light (254, 312, and 365 nm) and
artificial light (Cool White tubes, 4000 K). The chamber ensures a
constant and controlled exposure of the solutions to light throughout
the experiments. We captured a video of the overall process using
a SAMSUNG S6 Edge mobile phone camera (16.0 Mpixel). Video stills
at time intervals of 1.0 min were saved in JPEG format (300 dpi).
We measured the mean intensity of the colored solutions in gray scale
using Image J software (US National Institute of Health). We measured
the signal intensity in gray scale because it was the simplest approach
to acquire the analytical signal and avoid data manipulation as well
as user intervention. To obtain absorbance measurements, we used matched
quartz cells of 1 cm path length in a Jenway (Essex, U.K.) 6405 UV/vis
spectrophotometer.

General Experimental Procedure
For
all the sulfur-containing
compounds, the general experimental procedure involves the sequential
addition of 5.0 mM citric acid–sodium citrate buffer pH 3.5
and 1.0 mM AuCl4– into an aliquot of
the sample to prepare a solution with a final volume of 2 mL. A blank
solution containing distilled water, instead of the sample, is prepared
in parallel. Both the blank and the sample solutions are irradiated
simultaneously under UV or visible light against a white background
to facilitate the observation of color development. All the reactions
take place at room temperature with no heat detected through feel
when the solutions are removed from the irradiation source. The formation
of AuNPs is inspected by the unaided eye or a camera operating in
video mode. The time delay between the formation of a red–purple
coloration in the blank and the sample solutions, indicative of the
formation of AuNPs, is used as analytical signal and correlated to
the concentration of sulfur-containing species in the sample. A graphical
layout of the general experimental procedure is shown in Figure 1.

Depending
on the target analyte and the sample matrix composition, some modifications
to the general experimental procedure are necessary. The detailed
experimental procedure for each sulfur-containing compound and sample
matrix is given in the Supporting Information.

Samples
Commercial drugs in different forms (tab, powder,
or cap) were purchased from local pharmacies and dissolved in the
appropriate solvent (water for acetylcysteine, d-penicillamine,
and dl-captopril, dimethyl sulfoxide for zofenopril, and
ethanol for meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) under stirring and ultrasound
irradiation. The solutions were then filtered to remove undissolved
excipients and diluted as appropriate with distilled water. Treated
wastewater was obtained from the local wastewater treatment plant
and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter to remove suspended solids.
Bottled waters were obtained from local stores and used as purchased.
Artificial urine solution (AUS) was prepared by mixing 1.1 mM lactic
acid, 170.0 mM urea, 25.0 mM sodium bicarbonate, 2.0 mM citric acid,
2.5 mM calcium chloride, 90.0 mM sodium chloride, 25.0 mM ammonium
chloride, 10.0 mM sodium sulfate, 2.0 mM magnesium sulfate, 7.0 mM
dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, and 7.0 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate
in distilled water and adjusting the pH at the value of 6.0.35 Standard cysteine solution was added to yield
a final concentration of 200.0 μM and mixed under stirring for
5 min.
