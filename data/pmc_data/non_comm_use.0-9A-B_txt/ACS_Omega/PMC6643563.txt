A novel tetraphenylethylene-based
ladder network (MP1) made by
polycondensation reaction from 4,4′,4″,4‴-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzene-1,2-diol)
and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile and its COOH-functionalized
analogue (MP2) were synthesized for the first time. Their structures
were confirmed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning), Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, and elementary analysis. MP1 exhibited a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area (1020 m2 g–1), whereas the
COOH-functionalized MP2 showed a much smaller surface area (150 m2 g–1) but displayed a more uniform pore
size distribution. Because of the high density of nitrile groups in
the network polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) and strong
interaction with quadrupole CO2 molecules, MP1 exhibited
a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 4.2 mmol g–1 at 273 K, combined with an isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) of 29.6 kJ mol–1. The
COOH-functionalized MP2 showed higher Qst of 34.2 kJ mol–1 coupled with a modest CO2 adsorption capacity of 2.2 mmol g–1. Both
network PIMs displayed high theoretical ideal adsorbed solution theory
CO2/N2 selectivities (51 and 94 at 273 K vs
34 and 84 at 298 K for MP1 and MP2, respectively). The high selectivities
of MP1 and MP2 were confirmed by experimental column breakthrough
experiments with CO2/N2 selectivity values of
23 and 45, respectively. Besides the promising CO2 capture
and CO2/N2 selectivity properties, MP1 also
demonstrated high sorption capacity for toxic volatile organic vapors.
At 298 K and a relative pressure of 0.95, benzene and toluene sorption
uptakes reached 765 and 1041 mg g–1, respectively.
Moreover, MP1 also demonstrated some potential for adsorptive separation
of xylene isomers with adsorptive selectivity of 1.75 for m-xylene/o-xylene.

1 Introduction
Organic
network polymers often exhibit excellent chemical stability,
large microporosity and tunable pore sizes, synthetic versatility,
and diversity in functionality, leading to great potential in a variety
of applications such as carbon capture and sequestration,1−4 catalytic reactions,5−8 emerging toxic organic vapor removal, and others.9,10 Porous
organic polymers (POPs) can be classified into several categories,
such as hyper-cross-linked polymers (HCPs),11,12 covalent organic frameworks (COFs),13−15 porous aromatic frameworks
(PAFs),16 conjugated microporous polymers
(CMPs)17−21 and polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs).22−28 For efficient CO2 capture, both high CO2 capacity
and CO2/N2 selectivity are required.3,11,12,29,30 CO2 capacity can be boosted by
introducing polar groups to enhance the interaction between the polymer
and CO2 molecules, especially by introducing the nitrogen
functionality; CO2/N2 selectivity can be improved
by fine tuning the pore size of the POPs.10,31−35

PIMs can be divided into soluble linear ladder polymers and
porous
cross-linked network materials.26,36,37 The prototype linear ladder PIM-1, first reported by Budd and McKeown
in 2004, was formed by polycondensation of 3,3,3′3′-tetramethyl
spirobisindane-5,5,6,6′-tetraol and tetrafluorophthalonitrile
using K2CO3 as the catalyst.22 A large number of soluble ladder PIMs were developed thereafter
for membrane-based gas separation, catalyst, sensor applications,
and so forth.23,38−42 The first network PIMs, phthalocyanine-based nanoporous
network polymers, were reported by Mckeown’s group in 2002
and exhibited a surface area of around 450–900 m2 g–1.37 Later, several
network PIMs were developed with good H2 storage properties
and catalytic activity.6,26−28,43−47

Tetraphenylethylene is a D2h molecule widely used as an aggregation-induced emission element
because of the inefficient packing in the resulting polymers caused
by the twisted structure of the tetraphenylethylene building block.48,49 This site of contortion has also been applied as the building block
of POPs and COFs to achieve materials with large porosity, unique
electronic properties, and so forth.48,50−56 In addition, tetraphenylethylene has been used as a soluble ladder
PIM in membrane-based gas separation applications.57 Endowed by the unique properties of this “kinked”
structure, we adopted this site of contortion to design a new network
PIM (MP1) and a COOH-functionalized derivative network PIM (MP2 made
by hydrolysis of MP1). Here, we report the potential of the pristine
network PIM and COOH-functionalized PIM for potential CO2 capture and some toxic volatile organic vapor removal. The general
synthetic procedures of intermediates, monomer, MP1, and MP2 are shown
in Scheme 1. The detailed
syntheses and characterizations of the intermediates and network PIMs
are listed in the Supporting Information. Their chemical structure identification, thermal and chemical properties,
porosity and pore size distributions, gas adsorption and separation,
as well as organic toxic vapor sorption properties are reported.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedure of Tetraphenylethylene-Based Network PIM (MP1)
and Its Carboxylated Polymer (MP2)
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization of MP1 and
MP2 Networks
The synthesis of the intermediate 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethane
(ii) followed a previously reported procedure, and a good yield was
obtained.59 Compound (ii) was further reacted
with BBr3 in dichloromethane solution to remove all methyl
groups and form intermediate (iii). Monomer (iii) octa-hydroxyltetraphenylethylene
has a functionality f = 4 when reacted with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile
(f = 2) with an equal functional group ratio using
the conventional PIM formation method by heating the mixture to 120
°C for 6 h. The resulting tetraphenylethylene-based network PIM
(MP1) was obtained in a very good yield. After drying, the MP1 was
ball-milled to a fine powder and further hydrolyzed in a concentrated
ethanol/KOH/water solution for 48 h with 100 times KOH excess. A hydrolyzed
network PIM with COOH functionalization was obtained and denoted as
MP2. This hydrolysis method has been widely used and studied for the
linear soluble carboxylic group-functionalized PIM-1.60 Elementary analysis results showed that the N content was
1.87%, which indicated that the MP1 was not fully converted (∼75%
of CN hydrolyzed to COOH and 25% converted to CONH2) because
the insoluble MP1 network impeded the accessibility of the catalyst
and the base. Similar to the hydrolysis of PIM-1, some byproducts
such as acetic amide can be formed at the same time.60−63 Their structures were analyzed and identified by solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR), as shown in Figures 1 and 2. MP1 and MP2 were completely
insoluble in a conventional organic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone,
chloroform, methanol, water, and others, indicating that these polymers
are highly cross-linked networks.

Figure 1 13C NMR of the monomer (iii)
and 13CP-MAS
spectra of MP1 and MP2. The NMR signals were obtained using MAS with
a frequency of 14 kHz.

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of MP1 and MP2; the disappearance of the CN bond
at 2240 cm–1 in MP2 is highlighted.

MP1 and MP2 displayed five types of broad carbon
peaks as shown
in Figure 1. The chemical
shift of CN carbon in MP1 was located at 94 ppm (Figure 1). After hydrolysis under the
basic condition, the majority of CN converted to COOH groups, which
exhibited a chemical shift of the carbon toward a lower field of 164.7
ppm in MP2. Moreover, the stronger electronic-withdrawing effect of
the COOH group moved the chemical shift of nearby carbon e from 108
ppm of MP1 to the same as carbon b of 113 ppm and immerged in the
broad peak of carbon b.

The hydrolysis of −CN to −COOH
groups was also confirmed
by their FT-IR spectra, as shown in Figure 2. The CN signal at 2240 cm–1 disappeared completely indicating full hydrolysis of the CN group
(figure insert in Figure 2). At the same time, strong bonds emerged in the signals of
2900–3600 cm–1 and 1660–1750 cm–1, suggesting the formation of COOH groups.

The
two network PIMs demonstrated high thermal stabilities; their
thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) spectra under a N2 atmosphere
are shown in Figure 3. MP1 and MP2 exhibited onset decomposition temperatures of 450 and
320 °C, respectively. After hydrolysis of CN to COOH, a weight
loss of about 10% was observed from 300 to 450 °C, which might
be caused by the decomposition related to the COOH group.

Figure 3 TGA of MP1
and MP2. The powder was heated at a ramp rate of 3 °C/min
from room temperature to 800 °C under a N2 atmosphere.

Similar to many other PIMs, MP1
and MP2 demonstrated completely
amorphous structures, as indicated by their wide-angle X-ray scattering
results illustrated in Figure 4. After hydrolysis, the main halo increased from 2 θ
of 12° of MP1 to 20.7° of MP2, corresponding to a decrease
in the average chain d-spacing from 7.38 to 4.29
Å. This result clearly suggests that the carboxylation in MP2
yielded much tighter average chain packing than in MP1. Moreover,
the shape of the spectra changed from a bimodal distribution in MP1
to an almost single-peak distribution in MP2, indicating a more uniform
distribution of micropores in the hydrolyzed MP2 than MP1.

Figure 4 Wide-angle
X-ray scattering spectra of MP1 and MP2 powders.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas
of
the tetraphenylethylene-based network PIMs were analyzed by nitrogen
adsorption isotherms measured at 77 K (Figure 5a). MP1 demonstrated a large microporosity
as indicated by high adsorption values at low relative pressure (p/p0 < 0.1). MP1 displayed
a BET surface area of 1020 m2 g–1, which
is in the range of most conventional POPs such as CMPs (522–1043
m2 g–1),17,64 PIMs (618–1760
m2 g–1),45 ALPs (412–1235 m2 g–1),35,65 and azo-COPs (435–1340 m2 g–1).66 The hydrolysis of CN in MP1 to COOH
in MP2 resulted in a significant decrease in the BET surface area
from 1020 to 150 m2 g–1. Their pore size
distribution, derived from nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT)
analysis of their N2 adsorption isotherms, clearly showed
a broader distribution in MP1 with ultramicropores of 5–7 Å
and a large fraction of micropores between 10 and 20 Å (Figure 5b). In MP2, the majority
of pores fall between 8 and 14 Å; no ultramicropores of less
than 7 Å could be detected in MP2 by N2 adsorption;
this could indicate the creation of smaller pores of less than 5 Å.
Overall, this qualitative analysis is consistent with the aforementioned
hydrolysis of CN to COOH that resulted in smaller pores and more uniform
chain packing, as supported by the wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)
results with an average chain spacing of 4.29 Å.

isotherms of MP1 and MP2

2.2 Gas Storage
and Separation
To evaluate
the gas sorption and separation capacity, the adsorptions of N2, CH4, and CO2 for MP1 and MP2 at 273
and 298 K are shown in Figure 6. The network polymers exhibited a high gas adsorption capacity.
For example, the CO2 adsorption capacity of MP1 was 4.2
mmol g–1 at 273 K at 1 bar pressure. This value
is in the range of the highest adsorption values among all previously
reported network polymers (Table 1), higher than PAF-1 (2.05 mmol g–1),16 COFs (1.02–2.23 mmol g–1),67 TCMPs (1.25–2.8
mmol g–1),68 and POM-IM
(1.2–3.3 mmol g–1)69 and comparable to network polymers with N-functionalized groups
such as imidazole- and azo- and Tröger’s base-based
POPs [BILPs (2.5–5.2 mmol g–1),33,34,70 ALPs (3.24–5.36 mmol g–1),31,35 and TBs (4.05–5.19 mmol
g–1)].31,71 The high CO2 sorption capacity may be attributed to the large surface area and
high concentration of the polar CN groups, which favor the affinity
of quadrupole CO2 molecules by dipolar–dipolar interaction.
After hydrolysis, the MP2 polymer exhibited a reduced CO2 adsorption capacity of 2.2 mmol g–1 at 273 K and
1.50 mmol g–1 at 298 K. However, this value is also
high among most of the COOH-functionalized network polymers such as
CMP1-COOH (1.60 mmol g–1),64 PAF-26-COOH (2.32 mmol g–1),72 PAF-33-COOH (1.94 mmol g–1),73 and [HOOC]25%-H2P-COF (2.18 mmol
g–1),74 indicating that
the COOH-functionalized MP2 PIM is a very promising CO2 adsorbent.

isotherms of MP1 at 273 K. (b) N2, CH4, and

isotherms of MP2 at 298 K.

Table 1 BET Surface Area, CO2 Sorption
Capacity, and Heat of Sorption of MP1 and MP2
 	 	CO2 sorption capacity, 0.15 bar, mmol g–1	CO2 sorption capacity, 1 bar, mmol g–1

MP2	190	1.06	0.55	2.22	1.50	34.2	
To determine the CO2 binding affinity of MP1 and MP2,
their CO2 isosteric heats of adsorption (Qst) were determined at infinite dilution loading and were
calculated from the CO2 adsorption data collected at 273
and 298 K using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation (Figure S1). The Qst value of CO2 at a very dilute concentration for MP1 and
MP2 is 29.6 and 34.2 kJ mol–1, respectively. The Qst value of MP1 is relatively high among those
of other POPs, which are in the range of 20–26 kJ mol–1 (e.g., HCP: 20.0–24.0 kJ mol–1 and MCTFs:
20.5–26.3 kJ mol–1) and comparable to those
of imidazole-based POPs (26–34 kJ mol–1).30 After hydrolysis, MP2 showed a much higher isosteric
heat of adsorption (Qst) than MP1 (34.2
vs 29.6 kJ mol–1); this is a high value among all
functionalized POPs, indicating a strong affinity for CO2 to MP2. This result has previously been reported by Dawson et al.
where the highest CO2Qst values
were obtained for −COOH-derived networks in a series of functionalized
polar CMPs.64

The CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities of MP1 and
MP2 at 273 and 298 K were obtained by two
methods: First, their selectivities were calculated using an ideal
adsorbed solution theory (IAST), shown in Figure 7, at an equilibrium partial pressure for
CO2/N2 of 0.15/0.85 bar in the bulk phase and
0.5 bar/0.5 bar for CO2/CH4. Second, the selectivity
for CO2/N2 was also carried out using a breakthrough
experiment at 298 K; detailed experimental procedures are shown in
the Supporting Information (Figure S4),
and the results are summarized in Table 2. From Table 2, the CO2/N2 selectivity obtained
by IAST for MP1 is 51 at 273 K and 34 at 298 K; these values are in
the range of PAF-56 (40), SNW-1 (50),75 BILP-10 (57), and BTAP-2 (36–58). Notably, when MP1 was hydrolyzed
to MP2, a significant enhancement was observed in CO2/N2 selectivity to 94 at 273 K and 84 at 298 K. These values
are high relative to all reported COOH-functionalized organic porous
materials to date, such as PAF-26-COOH (20), PAF-26-COOK (50), PAF-26-COONa
(53), and [HOOC]-H2P-COF (77).30 The CO2/CH4 IAST selectivity of MP1 and MP2
are 11.9–21.6 at 273 K, respectively. The CO2/CH4 sorption selectivity of 21.6 is also in the range of the
highest CO2/CH4 solubility selectivity reported
to date, higher than the functionalized CMP such as CBZ (13.2) and
IN (15).76 The selectivity of CO2/CH4 decreased to 8.1 and 11.3 for MP1 and MP2, respectively,
by increasing the temperature from 273 to 298 K.

Figure 7 (a) IAST selectivity
of MP1 and MP2 for CO2/N2 at different pressures
and temperatures. (b) IAST selectivity of
MP1 and MP2 for CO2/CH4 at different pressures

273 and 298 K, respectively.

b Breakthrough experiment selectivity
of MP1 and MP2 at 298 K.

CO2/N2 gas separation performance by breakthrough
experiments of MP1 and MP2 were conducted using a custom-made set
up (see the Supporting Information). At
a flow rate of 10 mL/min and a CO2/N2 component
ratio of 15/85, their breakthrough results at 298 K are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 (a) CO2/N2 breakthrough curves of MP1 and
(b) CO2/N2 breakthrough curves of MP2. The feed
of CO2/N2 was at 1 bar with a component ratio
of 15 mol % CO2/85 mol % N2 and a flow rate
of 10 mL/min at 298 K.

N2 appears at a shorter time (83 s) after introduction
to the column than CO2 (152 s) in MP1, yielding a CO2/N2 selectivity of 23. The COOH-functionalized
MP2 even exhibited a CO2/N2 selectivity of 45,
which is comparable to the potassium-doped porous carbon KNC-A-K (44).77 The loading amount of MP2 was about half of
MP1. The lower adsorption amount and higher CO2/N2 selectivity followed the same qualitative trend as calculated from
the IAST results. This result may be attributed to the more uniform
pore size distribution of MP2, as discussed from the aforementioned
NLDFT analysis and WAXD results.

2.3 Vapor
Sorption of MP1 and MP2
Highly
toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including benzene and its
derivatives, are common air and water pollutants. Physical adsorption
using organic porous materials could be a potential method for their
capture, and some previous work has been reported for network polyimides
and CMPs.10,78−82 Besides promising CO2/N2 separation
properties, the above network PIM (MP1) also demonstrated good organic
solvent adsorption properties, as shown in Figure 9 and Table 3.

VOC adsorption in MP1 reached as much as 765 mg g–1 (9.8 mmol g–1) for benzene and
1041 mg g–1 (11.3 mmol g–1) for
toluene, which are very high
values among POPs, such as PAF-11 (874 mg g–1),83 NPIs (728–1049 mg g–1),84 and BoCMPs (590–950 mg g–1).82 Meanwhile, MP1 also
showed potential for adsorptive separation of xylene isomers, in which
the absorption amount followed the sequence of m-xylene
> p-xylene > o-xylene, where
the
sorption capacity for m-xylene was 1.35 times higher
than o-xylene (Table 3).

3 Conclusions
Here,
we report a novel tetraphenylethylene-based network PIM (MP1)
and its corresponding COOH-based network PIM (MP2). MP1 exhibited
a high surface area of 1020 m2 g–1 and
a CO2 adsorption capacity of 4.2 mmol g–1 at 1 bar and 273 K. The high density of the polar CN groups displayed
strong dipolar interactions with the quadrupole CO2 molecules.
The CO2/N2 selectivity of MP1 based on IAST
was 51 at 273 K and 34 at 298 K. Notably, the COOH-based MP2 exhibited
lower BET surface area of 150 m2 g–1 combined
with much higher selectivity for CO2/N2 of 94
at 273 K and 84 at 298 K. Breakthrough results at 298 K also confirmed
that the COOH-functionalized MP2 showed higher CO2/N2 selectivity of 45 than MP1 with a value of 23. Besides the
high gas adsorption and separation performance, MP1 also showed a
very high volatile organic vapor adsorption capacity for toluene (1041
mg g–1) and m-xylene (1042 mg g–1), which suggests that MP1 may have some potential
in environmental applications for capture of VOCs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methanone
was synthesized according to a previously reported method.58 Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), anhydrous
tetrahydrofuran, potassium carbonate (K2CO3),
dichloromethane, diethyl ether, methanol, boron tribromide (BBr3), N,N-dimethylacetamide,
hydrochloride acid (HCl), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and ethanol were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

4.2 Characterization Methods
Liquid 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the monomer and intermediates
were characterized with a Bruker AVANCE-III NMR spectrometer with
a frequency of 400 or 500 MHz in CDCl3 or dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. 13C CP-MAS of the network PIMs were performed using a Bruker
AVANCE-III 400 MHz NMR instrument with a 3.2 mm rotor; the rotation
speed was kept at 14k rpm. High-resolution mass spectroscopy of the
monomer was conducted on a Thermo LC/MS system with LTQ Orbitrap Velos
detectors. Elemental analysis of the intermediates and polymers were
performed using a Thermo Flash EA2000 elemental analyzer. FT-IR spectra
were acquired using a Thermo Nicolet iS10 infrared micro-spectrometer.
TGA of the network PIMs was carried out using a TGA Q5000 analyzer.
The BET surface area of the polymers was measured by N2 adsorption at 77 K (Micrometrics ASAP 2020 with micropore option);
their pore size distributions were determined using the NLDFT model,
with software from Micrometrics. N2, CH4, and
CO2 adsorption isotherms were performed on a Micrometrics
ASAP 2050 instrument at 273 and 298 K up to 1 bar. Dynamic vapor sorption
of benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, and xylene isomers were measured
using a TA step isotherm vapor adsorption instrument (VTI-SA) at 25
°C; the relative pressure (p/psat) was gradually increased from 5 to 95% after sorption
equilibrium was reached for each data point. WAXD of the network powder
was performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with a scanning
rate of 0.5°/min from 6° to 70°.
