Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of biopolyesters that
accumulate as carbon and energy storage compounds in a variety of
micro-organisms. The marine purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodovulum sulfidophilum is capable of synthesizing
PHA. In this study, we cloned a gene encoding a class I PHA synthase
from R. sulfidophilum (phaCRs) and synthesized PhaCRs using a cell-free protein expression system. The specific activity
of PhaCRs increased linearly as the (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme A (3HB-CoA) concentration increased and
never reached a plateau, even at 3.75 mM 3HB-CoA, suggesting that
PhaCRs was not saturated because of low substrate affinity.
Size exclusion chromatography and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
analyses revealed that PhaCRs exists predominantly as an
active dimer even in the absence of 3HB-CoA, unlike previously characterized
PhaCs. The linear relationship between the PhaCRs activity
and 3HB-CoA concentrations could result from a low substrate affinity
as well as the absence of a rate-limiting step during PHA polymerization
because of the existence of predominantly active dimers.

Introduction
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)
are biopolyesters
that accumulate in many organisms in the presence of excess carbon
and limited nutrient sources. PHAs have attracted attention as an
alternative source to petroleum-derived plastics, and their properties,
such as biodegradability and biocompatibility, have been extensively
studied.1 PHAs require a cost-consuming
carbon source, such as sugars or plant oils. Therefore, many studies
have focused on photosynthetic organisms as hosts for PHA production
because carbon dioxide can be directly used as a carbon source.2,3 Most studies regarding PHA production via photosynthesis have been
carried out using oxygenic phototrophs, such as higher plants and
cyanobacteria.4−6 However,
high levels of photosynthesis-mediated PHA production have not yet
been achieved. Although anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria produce
higher amounts of PHA compared with plants and cyanobacteria,7,8 these bacteria, particularly marine photosynthetic bacteria, have
not been extensively studied.

PHA synthase (PhaC) is a key enzyme
involved in PHA biosynthesis, and it catalyzes the polymerization
of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to PHA. PhaC
has been categorized into four classes based on its subunit composition,
sequence similarity, and substrate specificity.9 Class I and II synthases consist of a single subunit, and
class II PhaCs are composed of two different phaC genes (phaC1 and phaC2) separated
by phaZ, which encodes PHA depolymerase. Class III
synthases are composed of two subunits, PhaC and PhaE, whereas class
IV synthases are composed of the subunits PhaC and PhaR. Classes I,
III, and IV preferentially use short-chain-length (three to five carbon
atoms) CoA thioesters, whereas class II synthases catalyze the polymerization
of medium-chain-length (more than six carbon atoms) CoA thioesters. Ralstonia eutropha (R. eutropha) H16 is one of the best-known PHA-producing bacteria and has a class
I PhaC. PhaC from the purple sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Allochromatium vinosum (A. vinosum) is categorized as a class III synthase whose biochemical properties
have been extensively studied.10−12 In our previous studies, we reported the in vitro specific activity
of class I PhaC from Aeromonas caviae (A. caviae)13 and class III PhaC and PhaE from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Synechocystis),14 using a cell-free protein expression system. These studies
demonstrated that the dimeric form of PhaC containing (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl (3HB)-CoA is an active form that catalyzes the
polymerization. Recently, crystal structures of the C-terminal domain
(residues 201–589) of PhaC from R. eutropha at 1.8 Å resolution were reported.15,16 These
analyses also revealed that the PhaC dimer is active during PHA polymerization.

Our previous study demonstrated that some species of marine purple
photosynthetic bacteria could accumulate PHA.8 All purple nonsulfur bacteria accumulated PHA in the absence of
nutrient deficiency, and some of them produced high-molecular-weight
PHA, unlike the well-known PHA-producing bacteria. Although these
PHA properties might be derived from the enzymatic characteristics
of PhaC, those from marine purple nonsulfur bacteria have not yet
been studied. Rhodovulum sulfidophilum, a marine purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium, was characterized
in our study. R. sulfidophilum can
synthesize PHA,17 and its genome has been
completely sequenced.18

In this work,
we discovered a phaC gene in the R.
sulfidophilum genome, and it was categorized as a
class I synthase, unlike those of A. vinosum and Synechocystis. We previously
reported that PHA production conditions and PHA compositions of purple
nonsulfur bacteria differed from those of purple sulfur bacteria and
cyanobacteria.8 Here, we characterized
PhaC from R. sulfidophilum (PhaCRs) in vitro using a cell-free protein expression system and
demonstrated that PhaCRs exists preferentially in a constitutively
active dimeric form even in the absence of a substrate, unlike the
well-known PHA-producing bacteria. Elucidating these intriguing properties
of PhaC from R. sulfidophilum will
contribute to industrial PHA production and to a better understanding
of the PHA polymerization mechanism.

Results
PhaC from R.
sulfidophilum and Cell-Free Synthesis
We
found two homologous genes encoding PhaC proteins (WP_042463846 and WP_042457276), which are composed of 599 and 585 amino acids, respectively, in
the R. sulfidophilum genome. The amino
acid residues of the two proteins share 35 and 33% identity to that
of PhaC from R. eutropha. PHA biosynthesis-related
genes are clustered in bacterial genomes.9 In the R. sulfidophilum genome, the phaP gene encoding Phasin and the phaR gene
encoding the PHA repressor protein are located downstream of the phaC gene encoding WP_042463846 (Figure 1A). The phaZ gene encoding
the PHA depolymerase is located next to the phaC gene,
and these genes are transcribed in opposite directions. The other phaC gene encoding WP_042457276 did not colocalize with any
PHA biosynthesis-related genes. We analyzed the promoter regions using
BPROM, a bacterial promoter prediction program.19 Recognition sites were found in the upstream region of
the phaC gene encoding WP_042463846 but were not found in the gene encoding WP_042457276. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analysis was carried out to determine the expression levels of two phaC genes (WP_042463846 and WP_042457276). The expression level of the phaC gene encoding WP_042463846 was 1844-fold higher than that of the other phaC gene encoding WP_042457276. This observation strongly supports that the phaC gene encoding WP_042463846 is an actively expressed gene.
Therefore, the phaC gene encoding WP_042463846 was used for further analysis and is hereafter referred to as PhaCRs.

The accession numbers are as follows: WP_043812714 (Rubrivivax gelatinosus), WP_009856865 (Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus), WP_011615085 (Ralstonia eutropha), WP_013502713 (Rhodopseudomonas palustris), KAI96413 (Rhodomicrobium udaipurense), ADP70651 (Rhodomicrobium vannielii), EPY03196 (Phaeospirillum fulvum), CCG41701 (Phaeospirillum molischianum), WP_027288919 (Rhodovibrio salinarum), and CAB65395 (R. rubrum). Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was used as an outgroup. (C) Amino acid sequence alignment of PhaC
from R. sulfidophilum, R. capsulatus, R. sphaeroides, and R. eutropha. The amino acid sequences
were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm. The amino acids of the catalytic
triad are shown in red boxes. The conserved Cys residues are shown
in blue boxes.

The phylogenetic tree was generated using PhaC amino
acid sequences from 14 purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacteria as
well as from A. caviae, R. eutropha, and Synechocystis (Figure 1B). As with R. sulfidophilum, almost all purple nonsulfur bacteria
have multiple homologous phaC genes in their genome.
PhaCs that exhibit a higher amino acid sequence identity compared
with that of R. eutropha were selected
for alignment analysis. PhaCRs is close to those of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (R. sphaeroides) and Rhodobacter capsulatus (R. capsulatus). The amino acid alignment of PhaC
from R. sulfidophilum, R. sphaeroides, R. capsulatus, and R. eutropha is shown in Figure 1C. For R. eutropha, C319, D480, and H508 form a Cys-His-Asp
catalytic dyad for the covalent catalysis. C319 is proposed to serve
as a catalytic nucleophile, D480 acts as the general base catalyst,
and H508 deprotonates C319 for nucleophilic attack from the HB-CoA
thioester. C331, D486, and H515 in R. sulfidophilum were conserved in all PhaCs, suggesting that these three amino acids
correspond to C319, D480, and H508 in R. eutropha; these amino acids are catalytic residues for PHA polymerization.

The genomic region of PhaCRs was cloned from the genomic
DNA extracted from R. sulfidophilum and was used for the cell-free synthesis. The PhaCRs expression
was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) (Figure S2), and the major band
was approximately 66 kDa, which corresponds to PhaCRs.
To purify PhaC, an N11 tag with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease
recognition sequence was inserted. After TEV treatment, PhaCRs was purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column.
A 36 mL reaction mixture yielded 2.8 mg of purified PhaCRs.

PhaCRs Polymerization
Activity
The purified PhaCRs was mixed with 100
mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.12 mM Triton X-100 and characterized
using a polymerization activity assay with 3HB-CoA. The polymerization
activity of various concentrations of PhaCRs (0.75, 7.5,
10, and 15 μM) was evaluated using 750 μM 3HB-CoA. The
polymerization activity was increased at 0.75 μM PhaCRs and showed similar levels at concentrations greater than 7.5 μM
(Figure 2A). Consequently,
the specific activity decreased as the PhaCRs concentration
increased (Figure 2B), unlike Synechocystis and A. caviae.20,21 In Synechocystis and A. caviae, the specific activity
is saturated at approximately 1000 μM 3HB-CoA.20,21 The effects of various 3HB-CoA concentrations on the polymerase
activity were evaluated using different concentrations of PhaCRs (Figure 3). The specific activity increased sequentially as the 3HB-CoA concentration
increased and was never saturated, even at 3750 μM 3HB-CoA.
These results indicate that this substrate is not sufficient to fully
activate PhaCRs. PhaCs from A. caviae(22) and Rhodospirillum rubrum(23) have been shown to use the C6-monomer
(3HHx-CoA) as a substrate; thus, 3HHx-CoA was used as a PhaCRs substrate. PhaCRs showed negligible activity toward 3HHx-CoA
(Figure 4), indicating
that 3HB-CoA is required for the polymerase reaction of PhaCRs.

The concentrations of 3HB-CoA and 3HHx-CoA were both 1.5 mM. The concentration
of PhaCRs was 7.5 μM.

Size Exclusion Chromatography and
Native PAGE Analysis of PhaCRs
The dimeric formation
of PhaC is important for its polymerization activity according to
previous studies.24,25 The multimerization of PhaCRs was evaluated at various 3HB-CoA concentrations by size
exclusion chromatography (Figure 5A). Four peaks were detected at 6.2, 6.7, 9.2, and
12.3 min. The peak at approximately 12.3 min corresponded to 3HB-CoA.
According to the calibration curve generated from the elution times
of the molecular standards, the molecular weights corresponding to
peaks with elution times of 6.2, 6.7, and 9.2 min were estimated to
be 185, 166, and 71 kDa, respectively. Interestingly, a peak shift
was not observed when 3HB-CoA was added, although a slight change
in the peak height was observed. Native PAGE analysis of each fraction
resulting from size exclusion chromatography was performed to verify
the multimer formation of PhaCRs (Figure 5B). Peak 1 (elution time of approximately
6 min) and peak 2 (elution time of approximately 9 min) fractions
contained dimeric forms of PhaC based on their corresponding molecular
weights. The peak 1 fraction also contained high-molecular-weight
aggregates owing to multimeric PhaC. The molecular weight of peak
2 at 9.2 min was estimated to be 71 kDa, which likely corresponds
to the PhaCRs monomer (67 kDa). Native PAGE analysis revealed
that the peak 1 fraction contained the dimeric form of PhaCRs. This apparent difference may be explained by the compact structure
of the PhaCRs dimer. As shown in Figure 5A, the elution times were almost identical
in the presence and absence of 3HB-CoA. These results indicate that
3HB-CoA is not required for PhaCRs dimerization.

profiles of PhaCRs. Concentrations of 3HB-CoA ranging from
0 to 750 μM were used for the analysis. The two peaks are labeled
peak 1 and peak 2. The PhaCRs concentration was 7.5 μM.
(B) Native PAGE analysis of samples collected from peaks 1 and 2.
The PhaCRs and 3HB-CoA concentrations were 75 and 225 μM,
respectively. Peak 1 and peak 2: dimeric PhaCRs; peak 3:
3HB-CoA.

The cysteine (Cys) residue plays an important role in PHA polymerization.
Two thiol groups from the Cys residues on each PhaC monomer are proposed
to be required for the catalytic site formation.26 In addition to C331, PhaCRs contains four Cys
residues (C452, C465, C479, and C483). Phylogenetic analysis revealed
that PhaCRs was close to those of R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides (Figure 1B). Amino acid sequences of R. sulfidophilum, R. capsulatus, and R. sphaeroides were compared
with that of R. eutropha (Figure 1C). C452, C479, and
C483 were conserved in three purple nonsulfur bacteria, and these
three Cys residues might affect PhaCRs dimerization. To
verify this possibility, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) was
used to reduce disulfide bonds, and the multimerization of PhaCRs was analyzed in the presence of 10 mM TCEP by size exclusion
chromatography (Figure S3). The high-molecular-weight
aggregation fraction (peak 1) was increased by TCEP treatment. However,
no significant peak shift was observed by treatment with TCEP, suggesting
that disulfide bonds are not required for dimerization because PhaCRs formed stable dimers even in the reduced state.

Discussion
In this study, we cloned
a class I PhaC from R. sulfidophilum and synthesized PhaCRs using a cell-free protein expression
system. We demonstrated that the properties of PhaCRs differ
from those of other well-known PHA-producing bacteria. Monomeric and
dimeric forms of PhaC exist as an equilibrium in vitro, and dimerization
is induced in the presence of a substrate.13,14,24 Surprisingly, size exclusion chromatography
and native PAGE analyses revealed that the dimeric form of PhaCRs was dominant even in the absence of 3HB-CoA (Figure 5). Although a minor fraction
of the PhaC dimer was previously observed in the absence of a substrate
in other bacteria,13,24 to the best of our knowledge,
the predominance of the PhaC dimer has not been described until now.
We discovered four conserved Cys residues among three purple nonsulfur
bacteria (C331, C452, C479, and C483) and demonstrated that PhaCRs exists as a dimer in the reduced state (Figure S3). The lack of PhaCRs monomers could be
due to the fast association of the monomers with dimers and the stable
formation of the dimer. Disulfide bonds are known to increase the
conformational stability of many proteins.27 Conserved Cys residues in PhaCRs might affect the stability
of the dimer, which would lead to the predominance of the dimeric
form. Cys residues also have important roles in sensing the changes
in the cellular redox status. Many thioredoxin target proteins whose
activities are controlled by the reduction of disulfide bonds have
been identified in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.28 In purple nonsulfur bacteria, the RegB/RegA two-component
system,29 the AppA/PpsR transcription factor
system,30 and the transcription factors
CrtJ and Fnr31 are known to be associated
with the redox-responding regulators via the thiol–disulfide
exchange reaction. The activity of PhaCRs might be controlled
by the redox state through the thiol–disulfide exchange between
conserved Cys residues. R. sulfidophilum has two homologous phaC genes in the genome, as
previously described. Although the expression level of the second phaC gene was quite low, it is still possible that PHA polymerization
is regulated through the PhaC heterodimers.

PhaCRs activity never reached a plateau, even at very high concentrations
of 3HB-CoA, as shown in Figure 3, suggesting that this substrate was not sufficient to fully
activate PhaCRs. As a result, the specific activity decreased
as the PhaCRs concentration increased (Figure 2B). The predominant dimeric
form could affect these PhaCRs properties. The PHA polymerization
process occurs in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.
Regarding PhaC from R. eutropha, the
chain initiation rate is slower than the chain elongation rate.32 The dimerization and binding of 3HB-CoA are
assumed to be the rate-limiting steps in the initiation of PHA polymerization.
Alternatively, PhaCRs exists predominantly as a dimer;
thus, dimerization does not appear to be the rate-limiting step. The
specific activity against 3HB-CoA never reached a plateau, even at
high concentrations of 3HB-CoA (Figure 3), suggesting that PhaCRs has a low affinity
for 3HB-CoA. The polymerization activity of PhaCRs might
follow a first-order reaction, which is proportional to the substrate
concentration because of the predominance of its constitutively active
dimeric form and its low substrate affinity.

PhaCRs and PhaC from purple nonsulfur bacteria were classified as class
I PhaCs (Figure 1).
By contrast, PhaCs from A. vinosum and Synechocystis belong to class III. We verified that
the whole genome sequences of PhaC from six purple sulfur bacteria
strains (Thioflavicoccus mobilis, Thiocystis violascens, Marichromatium
purpuratum, Thiorhodococcus drewsii, Thiocapsa marina, and Halorhodospira halophila) were available, and we
determined that, similar to A. vinosum, five of the six strains have class III PhaCs, with H. halophila being the exception. In our previous
study, certain differences in PHA production were found between purple
nonsulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria. Purple nonsulfur bacteria
synthesized PHAs even when grown in the absence of nutrient deficiency,
whereas purple sulfur bacteria synthesized PHAs only under nitrogen-limited
conditions. We also demonstrated that purple nonsulfur bacteria synthesized
3HB and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) copolymers, whereas purple sulfur
bacteria produced 3HB homopolymers. Different PhaC properties between
the purple nonsulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria could result
in differences in PHA production. Further analysis will be required
to clarify these issues. The results of our study will contribute
to a better understanding of PHA production.

Materials and Methods
Cloning PhaC
R. sulfidophilum genomic DNA was
isolated using a standard procedure.33 PhaC
was cloned using a two-step PCR method according to previous reports.34,35 The forward (FW) and reverse (RV) primer sequences for the first
PCR reaction are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. The first PCR program was identical to that of
our previous report,34 and the second PCR
reaction was conducted according to previous methods34,35 established for the N11 tag. The N11 tag is a modified version of
the natural polyhistidine tag.35 A TEV
protease recognition sequence was inserted to cleave the target PhaC
from its partner protein in N11-tagged constructs.36 Table S2 of the Supporting Information lists the tags used in this study. After the 10th PCR cycle, the
annealing temperature was changed to 64 °C, and the duration
of the extension was prolonged for 5 s per cycle. The last step was
incubating the reaction mixture at 72 °C for 7 min. The resultant
product was immediately cooled to 10 °C, and its concentration
was determined using a PicoGreen dsDNA quantification kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA).

Cell-Free Synthesis
of PhaC
The dialysis-mode cell-free protein synthesis method
was used in this study, according to the methods presented in the
literature.13,14,34,37 The internal solution (36 mL) was composed
of the buffers, substrates, template DNA, and enzymes required for
transcription and translation. The solution contained 55 mM HEPES-KOH
buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.7 mM dithiothreitol, 1.2 mM adenosine-5′-triphosphate
(pH 7.0), 0.8 mM cytidine triphosphate (pH 7.0), 0.8 mM guanosine-5′-triphosphate
(pH 7.0), 0.8 mM uridine-5′-triphosphate (pH 7.0), 80 mM creatine
phosphate, 250 μg/mL creatine kinase, 4.0% polyethleneglycol
(average molecular weight 8000 g/mL), 0.64 mM 3′,5′-cyclic
adenosine monophosphate, 68 μM l(−)-5-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic
acid, 0.05% sodium azide, 175 μg/mL Escherichia
coli total transfer RNA (tRNA), 210 mM potassium glutamate,
27.5 mM ammonium acetate, 10.7 mM magnesium acetate, 1.0 mM each of
the 20 amino acids, 6.7 μg/mL pK7-CAT plasmid, 93 μg/mL
T7 RNA polymerase, and 9.0 μL of S30 extract. The S30 extract
was prepared from the E. coli BL21
CodonPlus RIL strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as previously described.34 Cell-free giant-scale dialysis using a dialysis
membrane with a molecular-weight cutoff (MWCO) of 15 kDa (Spectra/Por
7, Pierce, Rockford, IL) was performed using previously reported reaction
conditions.13 The internal solution was
dialyzed in a dialysis tube (Spectra/Por 7, MWCO of 15 kDa) against
the external solution at 23 °C for 16 h while being shaken.38

Purification
of PhaC
To purify PhaC, 36 mL of the internal solution containing
PHARs with the N11 tag with a TEV protease recognition
sequence was purified using an ÄKTA Xpress FPLC (GE Healthcare,
Little Chalfont, U.K.), according to protocols presented in the literature.13 The buffers used for the purification were described
in our previous study.13 Briefly, the protein
solution was purified using a HisTrap (5 mL, Ni-NTA column, GE Healthcare).
To remove the tag, TEV was added to the eluted protein fraction at
a final concentration of 10 μg/mL.35 The protein in the flow-through fraction was loaded onto a HiLoad
16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) to concentrate the purified
protein. The purified protein yield was determined using a Bio-Rad
protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Bovine serum albumin (BSA)
was used as the protein standard. SDS-PAGE was performed using 15
to 20% precast Tris-HCl gels (DRC Co Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The gels
were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.

Specific Activity Assay for PhaC
The specific activity
of PhaC was determined by using the method of Gerngross et al.,39 with modifications.13 Briefly, CoA released during the PhaC-catalyzed reactions can be
measured using Ellman’s reagent, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB).40 The assay mixture (360
μL) contained 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.12 mM Triton
X-100, an appropriate amount of 3HB-CoA (35, 70, 350, 700, 1000, 1400,
or 2100 μM), and variable amounts of purified PhaC (0.75, 7.5,
10, or 15 μM). The reactions were initiated by the addition
of PhaC. DTNB was added to the mixture, and then, the absorbance was
measured at 405 nm. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required
to catalyze the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min. The specific
activity was determined from the CoA release ranging from 0 to 1 min
of the reaction because the reaction obviously lacked a lag phase.

Size Exclusion Chromatography and Native
PAGE
The reaction mixture consisting of PhaC, 3HB-CoA, and
100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) in a total volume of 10 μL
was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. For TCEP treatment, the reaction
mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence of
10 mM TCEP. The reaction mixtures were then loaded onto a TSKgel G2000
SWXL column (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 20 mM NaPi (pH
7.0) containing 200 mM Na2SO4 at 25 °C.
The reaction mixture containing PhaC was eluted with the same buffer
at a flow rate of 1 mL/min at 25 °C. The molecular weight was
determined from the calibration curve prepared using the following
molecular weight standards: alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, 7.7 min),
BSA (66 kDa, 8.4 min), ovalbumin (44 kDa, 9.1 min), C2 (16 kDa, 10.9
min), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa, 11.8 min).

Native PAGE was carried
out using precast gradient (4–12%) Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), according to standard protocols. The gels were visualized
by silver staining using a SilverXpress Silver Staining Kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA).

Phylogenetic Analysis
The phylogenetic tree was prepared based on the PhaC amino acid
sequences of the 13 selected purple photosynthetic bacteria and constructed
using Phylogeny (http://phylogeny.lirmm.fr/phylo_cgi/index.cgi).41−45 NJplot was used to display
the phylogenetic tree.46

Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis
RNA of R. sulfidophilum was extracted under growth conditions.
Total RNA was extracted from R. sulfidophilum cells using the RNAeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan). Using 1
μg RNA as the template, cDNA was synthesized by the QuantiTect
Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. The PCR was performed using a SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA), and the product was analyzed
by StepOne (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Yokohama, Japan), according
to the protocol. To determine the expression levels of the two phaC genes (WP_042463846 and WP_042457276), the following sets of primers were used: phaC (WP_042463846), phaC-F (5′-ATTGAGCCCGTCGATATCCT-3′) and phaC-R (5′-GCA
GAC CCA TCC CTA TTT CA-3′); phaC (WP_042457276), phaC2-F (5′-CCG CCT GGA TCA TGA AAT AC-3′), and
phaC2-R (5′-ACA TGG CGA AGA CGG TAA AG-3′); rpoD, rpoD-F (5′-CTT GTC CTC GAT GAA ATC GC-3′)
and rpoD-R (5′-GTC CGC AAG GTG ATG AAG AT-3′).
