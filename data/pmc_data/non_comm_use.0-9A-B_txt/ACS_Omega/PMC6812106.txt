A new
sustainable synthetic method for cellulose acetate was developed
by a combination of I2-catalyzed solid–liquid acetylation
of cellulose and a milling process reducing the crystallinity of cellulose
within a few seconds. Milled low-crystalline cellulose was acetylated
faster than the original cellulose with higher crystallinity. The
plausible factors of acceleration were the conversion of the hydroxy
group in hydrogen bonds into reactive ones and the efficient formation
of the catalytic species I+ by the enhanced formation of
I3– assisted by the amorphous domain
of the milled cellulose, while the morphological and structural changes
were ignorable.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Cellulose
is the most abundant polymer in nature, and we use cellulose
in a wide range of applications in our daily life as fibers and sheets
like papers. Cellulose may also be transformed into various materials
by chemical modifications.1−3 Cellulose acetate is a green polymer
fabricable only from naturally occurring abundant resources, and its
excellent mechanical properties allow wide applications in filters,
fibers, plastics, and so on.4

However,
typical esterification of cellulose requires long reaction
time, harsh conditions, or dissolution requiring specific solvents
such as ionic liquids, due to the low reactivity of cellulose originating
from the crystalline nature of cellulose and interchain packing by
the hydrogen bonding. Exploration of methods enhancing the reactivity
of cellulose is a crucial subject. A typical approach is homogeneous
reactions dissolving cellulose in solvents. Ionic liquids5−10 including CO2 switchable systems10 and organic solvents with additives11−13 were employed to dissolve
cellulose by reducing its crystallinity. However, these methods are
accompanied by side reactions, degradation of the cellulose skeleton
possibly lowering the performance of the resulting products, high
energy, or toxic solvents. These disadvantages give negative impacts
on the sustainability of cellulose acetate.14

We reached for an idea for a new sustainable route for cellulose
acetate combining the solid–liquid reaction of cellulose in
acetic anhydride catalyzed by I2 developed by Biswas et
al.15,16 (Scheme 1) and novel rapid decrystallization of cellulose by
dry milling with rotational mortars developed by Nishioka et al. finishing
in a few seconds.17,18 A unique feature of this I2-catalyzed esterification is the high conversion despite the
heterogeneous reaction under mild conditions. In heterogeneous solid–liquid
reactions, the state of the solid affects the reaction behavior, and
hence, we decreased the crystallinity of cellulose to increase the
reactivity by milling. The advantageous feature of this milling is
the fast and facile process without requiring additional reagents.18 Other procedures for decrystallization require
longer time, energy-consuming ball-milling for mechanical treatments,19−24 or chemical modifications or dissolution before regeneration.25−28

Scheme 1 Solid–Liquid Acetylation of Cellulose Mediated by I2
Treated cellulose with lower
crystallinity has higher activity
in hydrolytic degradation.23,24 Mechanochemically assisted
esterification of lignocellulose was also reported to improve the
efficiency of the heterogeneous esterification, probably due to the
decrease in the crystallinity and the promoted penetration of anhydrides.29 This work opened the possibility of the acceleration
of esterification of cellulose, while the highest efficiency stayed
below 35%. For the practical application of the reduction of crystallinity
to esterification, further advances are necessary.

In this work,
we investigated the cooperation of heterogeneous
acetylation and dry milling for the modification of cellulose. We
found that the milling reducing the crystallinity of cellulose accelerates
the heterogeneous acetylation of cellulose, leading to quantitative
conversion, thanks to both the release of the hydrogen bonds and the
sufficient formation of the catalytic species.

2 Results
and Discussion
Acetylation was carried out by a heterogeneous
reaction of solid
cellulose and acetic anhydride catalyzed by I2 (0.9 mol
% to OH) at 40 °C. The degrees of crystallization of low-crystalline
cellulose (LC) obtained by milling and the original crystalline cellulose
(CC) were 22 and 62%, respectively. Solids, partially insoluble in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were obtained by the reactions of LC and
CC for 6 h in 83 and 81% yields, respectively. The other parts were
oligomers soluble in the resulting liquid consisting of acetic anhydride
and acetic acid. The DMSO-soluble part was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see the Supporting Information). The products with lower degrees of substitution (DS) were partially
insoluble in DMSO-d6, and this 1H NMR analysis provides quantitative information on the soluble fractions.
The degrees of substitution (DSNMR) were 96 and 59% for
the products obtained from LC and CC, respectively. Accordingly, the
acetylation behavior was monitored by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopies
(Figure 1). The DSNMR of the product from LC was higher than the DSNMR of the product from CC, until the quantitative acetylation of LC
was attained at 6 h. The acetylation of CC was completed in 8–10
h. This analysis indicates that the formation of soluble cellulose
acetate is faster in the acetylation of LC. The IR spectroscopic analysis
was carried out by comparing the wavenumber of the stretching vibrational
absorption of C=O in the whole solid, which shifts to a lower
wavenumber by the hydrogen bonds by the residual hydroxy moieties.
This IR spectroscopic analysis evaluates the total environment of
the carbonyl groups regardless of the solubility. The wavenumber of
the C=O absorption for the product from LC saturated faster
than that for the product from CC, and the trend of the shift was
identical to that observed in the NMR spectroscopic analysis. This
analysis clearly indicates that the hydroxy group in LC was consumed
faster than that in CC. Both of the analyses indicate that the reaction
of LC proceeded faster than that of the original CC. This investigation
revealed that the milling in seconds shortened the reaction time in
hours.

Figure 1 (a) Time courses of degree of substitution determined by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of DMSO-d6 soluble fractions (DSNMR) and (b) time courses of the
wavenumber of the peak top of νC=O during
the acetylation of LC (circle) and CC (square) with acetic anhydride
catalyzed by I2 (9 mol % of OH).

We investigated the factors for this acceleration. The possible
factors of the acceleration we examined were the release of the hydrogen
bond of the hydroxy groups, fragmentation of the cellulose chain by
milling, morphological changes, improved affinity of LC toward acetic
anhydride, and the change in the activation behavior of acetic anhydride
with I2.

First, we found a difference in the hydrogen
bond of cellulose
as expected. Figure 2 illustrates the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of LC
and CC measured by the KBr method using carefully dried KBr.21 The absorption of the stretching vibration of
O–H bonds (νOH) for LC and CC had peak tops
at 3409 and 3391 cm–1, respectively, and the peak
for CC is broader by the shoulder at a lower wavenumber region. The
νOH absorption of the free hydroxy group is reported
to be observed at 3580 cm–1,28 and absorption bands observed below 3400 cm–1 were assigned to νOH of hydroxy groups with the
inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which were revealed by precedent
detailed works on the FTIR spectroscopic analysis of chemically regenerated25,26 or modified30 cellulose. This difference
clearly indicates the release of hydroxy groups from hydrogen bonds
by the dry milling process.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of LC (plain line) and CC (dotted
line); (a) whole
spectra, (b) magnified spectra of the νOH region
normalized by the maximum intensity in this region, and (c) magnified
spectra of 800–1500 cm–1 normalized by the
intensity of the peak at 897 cm–1.

In addition, the relative intensity ratios of the peaks at
1430
cm–1 toward 897 cm–1 support the
decrease in the crystallinity of LC (Figure 2c). The spectra normalized by the intensity
of the peaks at 897 cm–1 show that the absorption
at 1430 cm–1 in the spectrum of LC is significantly
weaker than that in the spectrum of CC in a similar manner with ball-milled
cellulose.21

Second, we also found
another difference in the behavior of the
activation of acetic anhydride with I2. The cellulose sources
were immersed in a solution of I2 in ethyl acetate at 40
°C for 1 h. Then, we measured the UV–vis spectra of the
supernatants after filtration (Figure 3). The spectrum of the supernatant originating from
LC shows an absorption peak at 300 and 360 nm indicating the formation
of I3–. As known, cellulose is not positive
to the iodine–starch reaction as can be confirmed again from
the spectrum of the supernatant originating from the original CC,
while starch is positive by capturing I3– in the helical secondary structure of starch. The weak but positive
iodine–LC reaction in a similar manner with the iodine–starch
reaction implies accidental formation of starch-like cavity by the
randomization of the well-defined cellulose fibril by the milling.
The active species of this acetylation is I+ serving as
a Lewis acid activating the carbonyl group of acetic anhydride, and
the formation of I3– led to enhanced
formation of I+ accelerating the acetylation.

spectra of supernatants of solutions of I2 in ethyl acetate
after the immersion of LC and CC and the solution
of I2 in ethyl acetate without cellulose.

The effects of the following factors were found ignorable.
We could
confirm that the fragmentation of cellulose and the change in the
affinity with acetic anhydride did not take place. The molecular weights
and the thermal behaviors of fully acetylated cellulose were almost
identical (Supporting Information), indicating
that mechanical fragmentation did not take place during the milling.
The absorbencies of acetic anhydride in LC and CC were identical 63
and 68 wt %, respectively.

The effect of the morphological change
was also ignorable. The
milling changed the fibril morphology of cellulose into the plate-like
morphology by compression, as observed in the scanning electron microscopy
images (Figure 4).
We recrystallized LC under humid conditions (80 °C, RF = 90%,
2 h) in a similar manner with a reported recrystallization process20 and prepared cellulose with the same morphology
with LC and a higher degree of crystallization (56%) comparable to
the original CC. Then, the rate of acetylation was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis (Figure 5). As a result, LC was acetylated faster
than recrystallized cellulose, attesting that the degree of crystallinity
is an important factor determining the rate of acetylation. The rate
of acetylation of recrystallized cellulose was almost comparable to
or slightly lower than that of nontreated CC, and this result clearly
indicates that the morphological change affected negligibly or negatively.
A possible negative effect is the reduction of the surface area by
compression during milling.

LC.

Figure 5 Rate of acetylation of CC (square), LC (circle),
and recrystallized
(triangle) cellulose with acetic anhydride catalyzed by I2 (18 mol % to OH) at 40 °C.

For these experiments, we found that the randomized alignment of
cellulose assisting the formation of active I+ and the
weakened hydrogen bonding are the important factors for this acceleration
of acetylation of cellulose.

3 Conclusions
We found
the significant acceleration of heterogeneous acetylation
of cellulose by simple milling of cellulose in seconds. Two plausible
factors for this acceleration are the release of the hydrogen bond
and the enhanced formation of catalytic I+ species. The
enhanced reactivity originating from the amorphous nature will also
have positive impacts on other functionalizations, and further studies
are ongoing.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Cellulose (ARBOCEL 600)
was obtained from J. Rettenmaier & Söhne GMBH + Co. KG
(Rosenberg, Germany). LC was prepared by milling at 10 °C with
a rotation speed of 180 rpm with a shear and cooling milling machine
based on KGW-G015 (West Co., Ltd., Japan), modified by Nishioka et al.(18) The radius of the mortars
was 45 mm. The clearance between upper and lower mortars was 10 μm.
The upper mortar was fixed and the lower mortar rotated around the
center. Samples were injected through a slot located on the upper
mortar. The distance between the slot and the center was 20 mm. The
samples were grinded in a region of mortars in the radial distance
between 20 and 45 mm. The injected samples were discharged out typically
in two to five rotations of the lower mortar after injection. Therefore,
the estimated processing time in the mill machine calculated from
the size of the mortar and the rotation speed is 1 or 2 s. Acetic
anhydride was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). I2, acetic anhydride, Na2S2O3, ethanol, and ethyl acetate were purchased from Kanto Chemical (Tokyo,
Japan). All of the reagents were used as received.

4.2 Measurements
1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a JEOL (Tokyo, Japan) ECX-400 (400 MHz) and ECX-500
(500 MHz) spectrometer. FTIR spectra were recorded on a JASCO (Tokyo,
Japan) FT/IR-460Plus spectrometer. Samples were molded as KBr disks
using KBr dried under reduced pressure with heating above 200 °C
before use. XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku (Tokyo, Japan)
RINT RAPID diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation. The degree
of crystallization was calculated from the intensities of the diffraction
of the 200 lattice at 2θ = 22.6° and the diffraction at
2θ = 18.5°.31 Thermogravimetric
analysis was conducted using Seiko Instruments (Chiba, Japan) EXSTAR
6000 TG/DTA 6200 instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere. Scanning
electron microscopy measurements were conducted on a Hitachi (Tokyo,
Japan) SU8000 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV.

4.3 Acetylation of Cellulose
Cellulose
(284 mg, 1.75 mmol-unit), acetic anhydride (1.90 g, 18.6 mmol), and
iodine (40 mg, 315 μmol) were added in a glass test tube. The
mixture was magnetically stirred at 40 °C. Then, saturated aqueous
solution of Na2S2O3 (4 mL) and ethanol
(25 mL) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min
to wash the solid. The solid was collected by vacuum filtration and
washed with hot water (ca. 85 °C) and ethanol.
Acetylated cellulose was isolated by overnight drying at 60 °C
under reduced pressure.
