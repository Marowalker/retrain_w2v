Ribonucleotide:protein
interactions play crucial roles in a number
of biological processes. Unlike the RNA:protein interface where van
der Waals contacts are prevalent, the recognition of a single ribonucleotide
such as ATP by a protein occurs predominantly through hydrogen-bonding
interactions. As a first step toward understanding the role of hydrogen
bonding in ribonucleotide:protein recognition, the present work employs
density functional theory to provide a detailed quantum-mechanical
analysis of the structural and energetic characteristics of 18 unique
hydrogen-bonded pairs involving the nucleobase/nucleoside moiety of
four canonical ribonucleotides and the side chains of three polar
amino-acid residues (arginine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) of proteins.
In addition, we model five new pairs that are till now not observed
in crystallographically identified ribonucleotide:protein complexes
but may be identified in complexes crystallized in the future. We
critically examine the characteristics of each pair in its ribonucleotide:protein
crystal structure occurrence and (gas phase and water phase) optimized
intrinsic structure. We further evaluated the interaction energy of
each pair and characterized the associated hydrogen bonds using a
number of quantum mechanics-based relationships including natural
bond orbital analysis, quantum theory atoms in molecules analysis,
Iogansen relationships, Nikolaienko–Bulavin–Hovorun
relationships, and noncovalent interaction–reduced density
gradient analysis. Our analyses reveal rich variability in hydrogen
bonds in the crystallographic as well as intrinsic structure of each
pair, which includes conventional O/N–H···N/O
and C–H···O hydrogen bonds as well as donor/acceptor-bifurcated
hydrogen bonds. Further, we identify five combinations of nucleobase
and amino acid moieties; each of which exhibits at least two alternate
(i.e., multimodal) structures that interact through the same nucleobase
edge. In fact, one such pair exhibits four multimodal structures;
one of which possesses unconventional “amino–acceptor”
hydrogen bonding with comparable (−9.4 kcal mol–1) strength to the corresponding conventional (i.e., amino:donor)
structure (−9.2 kcal mol–1). This points
to the importance of amino–acceptor hydrogen bonds in RNA:protein
interactions and suggests that such interactions must be considered
in the future while studying the dynamics in the context of molecular
recognition. Overall, our study provides preliminary insights into
the intrinsic features of ribonucleotide:amino acid interactions,
which may help frame a clearer picture of the molecular basis of RNA:protein
recognition and further appreciate the role of such contacts in biology.

1 Introduction
Ribonucleotide:protein
interactions play vital roles in the catalytic
activity of a number of enzymes where ribonucleotides (rNs) such as
adenosine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate act as cofactors.
Such enzymes include kinases, G-proteins, motor proteins, and chaperones.1,2 In contrast to RNA:protein recognition that primarily occurs at
the broad and nonspecific macromolecular interface, the interaction
of a single rN occurs at the specific, well-defined deep binding site
of a protein.3 Consequently, although RNA:protein
complexes involve significant van der Waals contacts at the interface
and a relatively smaller proportion of hydrogen-bonding contacts,
rN:protein interactions predominantly involve hydrogen bonding between
rNs and amino acid residues of proteins.4−7

Considerable effort was put forth
in the literature to understand
the structural principles of RNA:protein recognition. This resulted
in a number of studies that identified the noncovalent contacts between
RNA and protein residues in the crystal structures of RNA:protein
complexes.4,8−19 In addition to revealing the preponderance of van der Waals contacts,9,10,20,21 few studies specifically focused on the diversity of hydrogen bonds
at the RNA:protein interface. For example, Allers et al. revealed
that RNA:protein contacts mainly involve the interaction of hydrogen-bonding
edges of nucleobases and the amide or carbonyl groups of the protein
backbone.4 Similarly, Jeong et al.12 and Kim et al.13 carried
out a statistical analysis on the nature of hydrogen bonds between
amino acid residues and rNs in RNA:protein complexes and observed
a number of interactions involving polar or charged amino acids. Further,
Lejeune et al.15 observed that, in contrast
to DNA:protein hydrogen-bonding interactions that frequently involve
the phosphate groups, analogous RNA:protein contacts more commonly
involve nucleobase edges and the ribose sugar. Subsequent work by
Ellis et al.16 revealed that proteins complexed
with mRNA, tRNA, or viral RNA have greater propensity to form nucleobase-specific
contacts compared to those complexed with rRNA. On similar lines,
Morozova et al.17 suggested that RNA:protein
recognition through a small number of specific hydrogen-bonding contacts
depends on the uniqueness in shape and donor–acceptor locations
on each RNA nucleobase. Furthermore, the intrinsic structures and
strengths of π–π contacts22,23 and hydrogen-bonding interactions5,24,25 between nucleobases and proteins in specific nucleic
acid:protein complexes have been explored using quantum mechanical
methods.

In contrast to a substantial number of studies on RNA:protein
recognition,
very few studies have specifically focused on the characteristics
of an interaction of a single rN with a protein. Nevertheless, Kondo
et al. carried out a statistical analysis of 446 crystal structures
of rN:protein complexes in an attempt to understand the structural
principles of hydrogen-bonding contacts between rNs and proteins.3 The study revealed that the hydrogen-bonding
interactions of a nucleotide can occur with the amino acid side chains
as well as the peptide backbone of a protein. The interactions were
further classified based on the identity of the nucleobase edge (i.e.,
the Watson–Crick (W) edge, Hoogsteen (H) edge, or sugar (S)
edge that interacts with the protein, Figure 1a–d).

numbering of the amino acids considered for studying ribonucleotide:amino
acid hydrogen-bonding interactions in nucleotide:protein complexes.
The side-chain atoms of R, E, or Q, the amino acids that interact
with ribonucleosides, are marked.

Despite the existence of Kondo and Westhof’s classification
scheme,3 information on the intrinsic structure
and strength of rN:protein interactions is currently missing in the
literature. This stems from the fact that, although structure determination
techniques such as NMR, X-ray crystallography, and electron microscopy
provide useful information on the noncovalent interactions within
the macromolecular context, these techniques are unable to determine
the intrinsic (i.e., isolated) nature of interactions between the
two noncovalently bonded constituent entities (e.g., nucleobase:amino
acid pairs). Further, such techniques cannot determine the strength
of noncovalent interactions in the macromolecular as well as in the
isolated context. However, the structure and strength of such contributing
interactions can be quantified with reasonable accuracy and reliability
using nonempirical QM methods. Indeed, QM methods have played a pivotal
role in understanding the nature of contacts involved in RNA base
pairing,26−32 nucleobase:protein hydrogen bonding in DNA:protein complexes,5,33 and nucleobase:amino acid stacking in RNA:protein complexes.21 This suggests that QM calculations on rN:protein
complexes can contribute toward providing an improved understanding
of the RNA:protein interaction landscape.

As a first step toward
understanding the nature of rN:protein interactions,
our recent study carried out QM analysis on the pairs of RNA bases
and the side chains of aspartic acid (D) or asparagine (N) residues
occurring in rN:protein crystal structures.25 Through comparison of the crystal-structure geometries and isolated
(i.e., fully optimized) geometries of these complexes, our analysis
revealed the rich variability in the structure and strengths of rN:protein
hydrogen bonding. Although analogous studies involving other amino
acids can provide a comparative analysis of the role of amino-acid
side chains in determining the structure and strength of nucleotide:protein
contacts, such an analysis is currently missing in the literature.

To fill this void, in the present work, we extend the previous
efforts toward understanding the interaction landscape of nucleobases25−28,34−37 by analyzing the structure and
strength of hydrogen bonding between four canonical rNs and the side
chains of three polar amino acids, arginine (R), glutamic acid (E),
and glutamine (Q). Specifically, the analyzed pairs involve the interaction
of R, E, or Q through the amide (Amd), carboxylic (Car), or guanidinium
(Gnm) group of the amino acid side chains with one of the rN edges
(i.e., W edge, H edge, or S edge, Figure 1). These pairs are denoted as A/G/C/U:R/E/Q
W/H/S:Amd/Car/Gnm, depending on the identity of the nucleobase constituting
the rN (adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or uracil (U)), interacting
amino acid (R, E, or Q), nucleobase edge (W, H, or S), and the amino
acid side chain (Amd, Car, or Gnm, Figures 1 to 9). In addition
to the analysis of structure and strength of complexes in their crystal
structure occurrences (Table S1) and isolated
gas-phase or solvent (water)-phase optimized geometries, we propose
structures and reveal the strength of five hitherto unknown pairs
by modeling them based on other available pairs. Overall, our analysis
is expected to help derive a better understanding of the rules governing
the rN:protein interaction at the atomic level and thus contribute
toward further understanding the structural principles of RNA:protein
recognition.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Occurrence
of rN:Amino Acid Pairs in rN:Protein
Crystal Structures
The 16 unique rN:amino acid pairs considered
in the present work represent the rich diversity in combinations of
nucleobases and nucleobase edges that interact with proteins and form
rN:amino acid pairs (Table S1). Specifically,
in terms of the identity of the interacting nucleobase, eight pairs
involve A, one pair involves C, four pairs involve G, and three pairs
involve U (Figure 2). Alternatively, in terms of the interacting nucleobase edge, nine
pairs involve the W edge, six pairs involve the H edge, and one pair
involves the S edge.

Four of the pairs involve a single occurrence
in the crystal structure dataset,3 which
in turn include two pairs involving E, one pair involving Q, and one
pair involving R (Figure 2a). However, the remaining 12 pairs exhibit multiple occurrences3 and include 4 pairs involving E (Figure 2b), 5 pairs involving Q (Figure 2c), and 3 pairs involving
R (Figure 2b–d).
Structural superimposition of the heavy-atom coordinates of the multiple
crystal occurrences of each pair reveals the relative conformational
differences in each context (Figure 2).

Six of the total 16 pairs possess unique hydrogen-bonding
patterns
corresponding to each edge interaction and are thus designated as
“unimodal pairs” (Figure 2). In contrast, the remaining 10 pairs can be divided
into five categories where the two structures within each category
(designated with symbols I and II, Figure 2) interact through the same nucleobase edge,
albeit with different hydrogen-bonding patterns.3 These structures thus exhibit multimodality in nucleobase
edge interactions and are thus designated as “multimodal pairs.”

2.2 Hydrogen-Only Optimizations
Hydrogen-only
optimizations were carried out to identify the hydrogen bonds between
R, E, or Q and rNs within the native crystal environment. These calculations
reveal rich variability in hydrogen bonds among the six unimodal pairs
(Figure 3a). Specifically,
one of these pairs possesses a single N–H···O
hydrogen bond, one pair possesses donor-bifurcated hydrogen bonding,
and one pair possesses acceptor-bifurcated hydrogen bonding (Figure 3a). However, each
of the remaining three pairs possesses two conventional donor–acceptor
hydrogen bonds (Figure 3a). Due to variation in the nature of hydrogen bonds, these pairs
exhibit a wide range (−3.6 to −34.8 kcal mol–1) in binding energies (Figure 3a).

In contrast to the unimodal pairs, one structure
within each of the five multimodal pairs (Figure 3b) possesses either a single (N–H···O)
bond or acceptor-bifurcated hydrogen bond, whereas the other structure
invariably possesses two conventional donor–acceptor hydrogen
bonds (Figure 3b).
In terms of binding energies, the two structures of G:E W:Car (i.e.,
I and II, Figure 3b)
possess similar (i.e., within 0.4 kcal mol–1) interaction
energies, mainly since both structures possess two hydrogen bonds
of a conventional/bifurcated type. In contrast, due to a difference
in the number of hydrogen bonds, the two structures within each of
the remaining four multimodal pairs exhibit a significant (4.4 to
21.1 kcal mol–1, Figure 3b) difference in binding energies.

In addition to the above pairs, two unique variants could be derived
for G:E W:Car (II), depending on the initial positioning of the added
hydrogen atoms. Specifically, although the parent structure (G:E W:Car
(II)) possesses a hydrogen on the carboxylic oxygen that interacts
with the N1 of G, a pair of alternate structures (IIa and IIb) involves
attachment of the hydrogen atom to the carboxylic oxygen that interacts
with the N2 of G (Figure 4). Although structures II and IIa are similar in terms of
the planarity of the N2 amino group of G and the involvement of this
amino group as a hydrogen bond donor, structure IIb utilizes the amino
nitrogen as a hydrogen-bond acceptor where the amino hydrogens attain
a nonplanar orientation with respect to the nucleobase skeleton due
to pyramidalization. As a result, the nitrogen interacts with the
hydroxyl donor of the carboxylic group of E (Figure 4). Binding energies reveal that the “amino–acceptor”
structure (IIb) is 2.9 kcal mol–1 more stable than
the competing “conventional” structure (IIa). Regardless,
the structural similarity and close energetic separation suggests
that the interconversion between the conventional and amino–acceptor
structures may not require any significant geometrical or energetic
penalty. Consequently, such low-barrier interconversions may be helpful
in dynamics at the RNA:protein interface. Owing to their potential
importance in RNA dynamics, such interactions must be investigated
in detail in the future. Nevertheless, similar interactions have previously
been described in RNA base pairs38 and
more recently in contextual RNA:protein hydrogen bonding.25

2.3 Full Optimizations
Full optimizations
were carried out to reveal the intrinsic hydrogen-bonding characteristics
of the pairs in their free (i.e., isolated) forms. In the absence
of the macromolecular environment, full optimizations maximize the
number and strength of hydrogen bonds in each pair. Thus, the fully
optimized geometries represent the ideal geometries that would be
obtained in the gas phase in the absence of macromolecular effects.

On full optimization, 11 of the total 18 pairs (16 original pairs
and 2 G:E W:Car (II) variants (IIa and IIb)) retain the hydrogen-bonding
pattern present in the starting crystal structures (Figure 5). Except A:E W:Car (II), which
possesses a single hydrogen bond, all these pairs involve two strong
(i.e., N–H···N/O type) hydrogen bonds in the
crystal structures and fully optimized structures. However, due to
substantial changes in amino acid conformation on full optimization,
many of these pairs observe substantial (up to 1.757 Å in rmsd, Figure 6) deviation between
hydrogen-only-optimized and fully optimized geometries. Regardless,
due to significant stability provided by hydrogen bond(s), these pairs
possess high (−9.4 to −33.6 kcal mol–1, Figure 5) interaction
energies, which are comparable to the interaction energies of the
corresponding hydrogen-only-optimized pairs (−8.2 to −34.8
kcal mol–1, Figure 3).

In contrast, five pairs involve the formation
of additional hydrogen
bonds on full optimization (Figure 6). Due to greater change in structure resulting from
change in hydrogen bonding, these pairs possess higher (0.950–2.694
Å, Figure 6) rmsd
values between hydrogen-only-optimized and fully optimized structures
compared to the pairs that do not change in hydrogen bonding on full
optimization (0.395–1.757 Å, Figure 6). Further, these pairs possess a significantly
stronger interaction (−5.1 to −23.0 kcal mol–1, Figure 6) than that
of their hydrogen-only-optimized counterparts (−0.9 to −5.5
kcal mol–1, Figure 3), mainly due to an increase in the number of hydrogen
bonds.

On the other hand, two pairs (i.e., G:E W:Car (I and
II)) undergo
change in their hydrogen bonding pattern on full optimization. Specifically,
full optimization of these structures leads to breaking of hydrogen
bonds involving the amino group of G and formation of hydrogen bonds
involving O6 of G (Figure 7). Further, due to optimization of the hydrogen-bonding pattern,
the fully optimized geometries of these complexes possess significantly
higher binding energies (−24.2 to −24.4 kcal mol–1, Figure 7) compared to hydrogen-only-optimized geometries (−9.9
to −10.3 kcal mol–1, Figure 3).

Regardless of whether new hydrogen
bonds are formed or not on full
optimization, the hydrogen bonding A–H distances within the
retained hydrogen bonds of all 18 complexes are shorter in fully optimized
geometries (1.563–2.588 Å) than in the respective hydrogen-only-optimized
geometries (1.471–2.664 Å). Further, the average interaction
energy of the fully optimized geometries (−16.4 kcal mol–1) is higher than that of the hydrogen-only-optimized
geometries (−11.3 kcal mol–1, Figure 3–7). This suggests that the binding strength within the macromolecular
crystal geometries of the pairs is enhanced on an average by 5.1 kcal
mol–1 on full optimization.

Among the three
(R, E, and Q) amino acids considered, the average
interaction energy of pairs involving R (−26.7 kcal mol–1) is significantly greater than those involving Q
(−7.6 kcal mol–1) and E (−7.3 kcal
mol–1) as well as the previously studied pairs involving
D (−11.8 kcal mol–1) and N (−11.4
kcal mol–1). Alternatively, when the variation in
interaction energies among four different nucleobases is considered,
C possesses a higher average interaction energy (−33.6 kcal
mol–1) followed by G (−20.1 kcal mol–1), U (−17.6 kcal mol–1),
and A (−10.9 kcal mol–1).

Classification
of the optimized pairs in terms of the nature of
hydrogen bonds reveal that 13 pairs possess a conventional O/N–H···N/O
type of hydrogen bond (Figures 5 and 6) and one (A:E H:Car(I)) pair
possesses one N–H···O and one C–H···O
hydrogen bonds. Further, two (U:R S:Gnm and A:Q H:Amd) pairs possess
amino–donor bifurcated bonding, and one (U:R H:Gnm) pair possesses
acceptor-bifurcated hydrogen bonding. In addition, one (G:E W:Car
(IIb)) pair involves one conventional N–H···N/O
hydrogen bond and one amino–acceptor hydrogen bond. More importantly,
the binding of the amino–acceptor structure (−9.4 kcal
mol–1) is comparable to the corresponding conventional
structure (G:E W:Car IIb, −9.2 kcal mol–1). This reiterates the importance of amino–acceptor structures
in RNA:protein interactions involving the guanine nucleobase and suggests
that such interactions must be considered in detail in the future
while studying noncovalent interactions in the context of molecular
recognition.

2.4 Solvent-Phase Calculations
We reoptimized
the structures in implicit water to estimate the influence of bulk
solvent screening on their geometries and binding strengths. The structural
characteristics of the pairs optimized in the solvent phase do not
deviate significantly from their gas-phase counterparts (rmsd of 0.051–0.968
Å), although solvent-phase structures possess a slight change
in the A–H distances (1.579–2.397 Å, Figures 8 and 9) compared to their gas-phase counterparts (1.563–2.588 Å, Figures 5–7).

The interaction energies of the pairs in
the solvent phase (−1.1 to −12.7 kcal mol–1) are significantly reduced compared to the gas phase values (−5.5
to −33.6 kcal mol–1, Figures 5–9). Although
11 pairs possess small (1 to 6 kcal mol–1) reduction,
7 pairs show substantial (11 to 23 kcal mol–1) reduction
in gas-phase and solvent-phase interaction energies (Figures 8 and 9). Specifically, the lowest (1 kcal mol–1) reduction
in interaction energy on inclusion of solvent occurs in A:Q H:Amd
(II). However, the highest (23 kcal mol–1) reduction
occurs in C:R W:Gnm where the solvent-phase interaction energy (−10.6
kcal mol–1) is more than three times lower compared
to the gas-phase interaction energy (−33.6 kcal mol–1).

Our analysis further reveals that the difference in interaction
energies between each type of multimodal structure is smaller in the
solvent phase (0.1 to 11.2 kcal mol–1) compared
to the gas phase (0.6 to 15.2 kcal mol–1, Figures 5–9). This suggests that variable hydrogen-bonding
patterns through same nucleobase edge interactions become closer in
energy in the solvent phase. This may, in turn, lead to a greater
possibility of switching between such structurally similar interaction
states and may thus help in macromolecular dynamics during RNA:protein
recognition. The analogous role of multimodal base pairs in RNA dynamics
has previously been proposed in the context of RNA base pairing.39

Although the conventional structures (I
and II) of G:E W:Car possess
up to 15 kcal mol–1 higher interaction energy than
that of the amino acceptor structure (IIb) in the gas phase, the difference
is reduced to only 6 kcal mol–1 in the solvent phase
(Figures 8 and 9). More importantly, the amino–acceptor structure
possesses 1.0 kcal mol–1 stronger binding than that
of the third conventional structure (IIa) in the solvent phase (Figures 8 and 9). This reiterates our proposition from gas-phase calculations
that both conventional and amino acceptor structures may play an important
role in the stability of rN:amino acid interactions.

2.5 Modeled Interactions
We modeled five
additional interactions that have not been observed in the rN:protein
crystal structures (Figure 10). Specifically, we modeled C:E W:Car, U:E W:Car (I), and
U:E W:Car (II) based on the optimized structure of A:E W:Car. However,
A:R H:Gnm and A:Q W:Amd were modeled on the optimized geometry of
G:R H:Gnm and C:Q W:Amd, respectively.

modeled nucleobase:amino acid pairs. Optimized hydrogen-bond donor–acceptor
distances (Å) and IEFPCM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) are provided. (b) IEFPCM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)

distances (Å) for hydrogen-bonding interactions are provided.
(c) Superposition of the B3LYP/6-311+G(2df,p) fully optimized gas-phase
(red) and IEFPCM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) fully optimized solvent (water)-phase
(blue) geometries of the modeled structures; rmsd values (Å)
between the two sets of structures (parentheses) are provided.

All the modeled interactions remain stable both
in the gas phase
and solvent phase, which points toward their intrinsic stability (Figure 10). Further, the
structural characteristics of all five pairs remain similar in gas
and solvent phases (rmsd of 0.086–0.137 Å, Figure 10), and the hydrogen-bonding
pattern remains unaltered in both phases. However, as observed for
fully optimized structures derived from crystal structures, the interaction
energies of the modeled structures are reduced in the solvent phase
(−7.3 to −13.4 kcal mol–1) compared
to the gas phase (−13.8 to −20.0 kcal mol–1, Figure 10). Further,
since the magnitude of reduction in binding energies in the solvent
phase is variable and depends on the type of hydrogen bonds present
in each pair, the trend in the gas-phase relative stability of the
pairs changes on inclusion of the solvent (Figure 10). Regardless, the magnitude of stability
of the modeled interactions points toward their candidature for likely
occurrence in nucleotide:protein or RNA:protein complexes that might
be crystallized in the future.

2.6 Characteristics
of Hydrogen Bonds in the Optimized
Complexes
Analysis of each gas-phase optimized pair using
NBO analysis reveals that the average delocalization energy (E(2)) associated with n(A) → σ*(D–H)
charge delocalization of each hydrogen bond follows the order O–H···N/O
bonds (24.2 kcal mol–1) > N–H···N/O
hydrogen bonds (13.6 kcal mol–1, Table S3). A similar trend is obtained for the ρHBCP or ∇2ρHBCP values (0.049
or 0.115 a.u. for O–H···N/O bonds and 0.029
or 0.081 a.u. for N–H···O/N bonds, Table S3). Similarly, the average Δν
associated with O–H···N/O bonds (713.5 cm–1) is greater than that with N–H···O/N
hydrogen bonds (280.17 cm–1, Table S3). Further, a similar trend is observed in EHB values calculated from the Iogansen relationship
(EHBO – H···O/N (8.3 kcal mol–1) > EHBN – H···O/N (5.0 kcal mol–1)) and Nikolaienko–Bulavin–Hovorun
relationships (EHBO – H···O/N (8.7
kcal mol–1) > EHBN – H···O (4.6 kcal mol–1), Table S3).

To find a correlation between the hydrogen-bond energies
obtained from Iogansen relationships, Nikolaienko–Bulavin–Hovorun
relationships, and E(2) values from NBO analysis,
we added the hydrogen bond energies of all hydrogen bonds in each
pair to obtain ΣEHBIogansen, ΣEHBNBH, and ΣE(2) (Table S4 and Figure 11). ΣEHBIogansen and ΣEHBNBH values correlate with ΣE(2) energy for only three complexes where |ΣE(2) – ΣEHBIogansen| or |ΣE(2) – ΣEHBNBH| lies within 5 kcal mol–1 (Table S4). On the other hand, ΣEHBIogansen and ΣEHBNBH correlate very well within 13 of the 23
complexes with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94 and |ΣEHBIogansen – ΣEHBNBH| ranging from 0.0 to 2.6 kcal mol–1 (Figure 12 and Table S5). However, the remaining 10 complexes
show weak correlation where |ΣEHBIogansen –
ΣEHBNBH| ranges from 3.9 to 6.0 kcal mol–1 (Table S5).

of hydrogen-bonding energies of all hydrogen
bonds within each pair deduced using NBO analysis (ΣE(2)), the Iogansen relation (ΣEHBIogansen), and
Nikolaienko–Bulavin–Hovorun relations (ΣEHBNBH) with the gas-phase interaction energy.

pair calculated using the Iogansen relation (ΣEHBIogansen)
and Nikolaienko–Bulavin–Hovorun relations (ΣEHBNBH) for 13 pairs that show good correlation. See Table S5 for details.

In contrast, the gas-phase interaction energies (Egas phase) correlate well with ΣEHBIogansen for
10 of the 23 complexes (R2 of 0.92 and Egas phase – ΣEHBIogansen of
3 kcal mol–1), whereas the remaining complexes show
weak correlation (R2 of 0.52 and Egas phase – ΣEHBIogansen of
up to 21 kcal mol–1, Figure 13 and Table S6). Regardless, the contribution of the hydrogen-bonding energy (ΣEHBIogansen) to Egas phase ranges between 20
and 107% for all complexes (Table S4).
Similarly, the Egas phase correlates
with ΣEHBNBH for nine complexes (R2 of 0.92 and Egas phase –
ΣEHBNBH of up to 5 kcal mol–1),
although the remaining 13 complexes show weak correlation (R2 of 0.22 and Egas phase – ΣEHBNBH of up to 26 kcal mol–1, Figure 13 and Table S7). However, irrespective of the strength
of correlation, ΣEHBNBH contributes 21 to 120% to the Egas phase values (Table S4). In contrast, although ΣE(2) correlates
with Egas phase in 10 complexes (R2 of 0.94 and Egas phase – ΣE(2) of up to 4 kcal mol–1), the remaining 13 complexes show very weak correlation (R2 of 0.94 and Egas phase – ΣE(2) of up to 37 kcal mol–1, Figure 13 and Table S8). Out of these, seven complexes also
show correlation between Egas phase and ΣEHBIogansen values (Table S6). However, all three energies correlate with gas-phase interaction
energies for only one complex (A:Q H:Amd (II)).

In addition, we performed NCI-RDG analysis to provide a graphical
visualization of hydrogen bonds and distinguish them from other weak
interactions. Specifically, the plot of S and sign(λ2)ρ reveals troughs, which correspond to different noncovalent
interactions. The troughs corresponding to attractive interactions
(such as hydrogen bonds) lie in the region of negative sign(λ2)ρ, whereas repulsive interactions lie in the positive
region. NCI plots for representative complexes are provided in Figure 14, whereas those
for all the complexes are given in Figures S3 and S4. NCI plots reveal that O–H···N/O
hydrogen bonds appear in the region of higher ρ values followed
by N–H···O/N bonds. In addition to hydrogen
bonds, certain secondary interactions could be visualized in the NCI-RDG
plot, which could be ascribed to nonspecific dispersion contacts.
Overall, in conjunction with ρHBCP values obtained
from QTAIM analysis (Figures S1 and S2),
NCI-RDG analysis helps in characterization and confirmation of hydrogen-bonding
interactions in the studied pairs.

3 Conclusions
In the present work, we analyzed 23 hydrogen-bonded pairs derived
from canonical rNs and R, E, or Q residues of proteins. These include
16 pairs directly derived from crystal structures of rN:protein complexes,
2 additional alternate geometries of one pair that differ in the position
of the hydrogen atoms, and 5 modeled pairs.

Analysis of pairs
present in rN:protein crystal structures reveals
two categories of pairs, unimodal and multimodal. Although each unimodal
pair possesses a unique hydrogen-bonding pattern, the multimodal pairs
involve multiple hydrogen-bonding possibilities through the same interacting
nucleobase edge. Hydrogen-only optimizations reveal that all unimodal
pairs as well as one type of geometry of each multimodal pair possess
a single or bifurcated hydrogen bond. However, the second type of
geometry of each multimodal pair invariably possesses two conventional
donor–acceptor hydrogen bonds.

Gas phase and solvent-phase
full optimizations reveal three categories
of pairs: (i) pairs that retain the crystal-structure hydrogen-bonding
pattern on full optimization, (ii) pairs that form additional hydrogen
bonds on full optimization, and (iii) pairs that undergo complete
change in hydrogen-bonding patterns on full optimization. Further,
interaction energy calculations reveal that the average binding strength
of the pairs present within the macromolecular crystal environment
is enhanced on gas-phase optimization, although the binding strength
in the solvent phase is smaller compared to the gas phase. More importantly,
the difference in interaction energies between each type of multimodal
structure is smaller in the solvent phase compared to the gas phase.
This points toward the possibility of switching between such structurally
similar and energetically close interaction states, which may be significant
for the dynamics at the RNA:protein interface. Overall, structural
analysis of the pairs reveals significant variability in their geometrical
patterns and associated stabilities.

Our analysis further reveals
one example (G:E W:Car) where the
alternate positioning of the amino hydrogens leads to either amino–donor
or amino–acceptor optimized structures, which lie very close
in energy especially in the solvent phase. This suggests that both
these types of interactions may play a role in the stability of rN:amino
acid interactions involving guanine and should be considered in detail
in the future while studying the noncovalent interactions in the context
of molecular recognition.

Analysis of the five modeled pairs
reveals their intrinsic stability
both in the gas phase and solvent phase, although the binding strength
is reduced in the solvent phase compared to the gas phase. Regardless,
the stability of the modeled interactions points toward their candidature
for likely occurrence in the crystal structures of nucleotide:protein
or RNA:protein complexes.

The strength of hydrogen bonds within
each pair was analyzed in
terms of NBO analysis, vibrational frequency-based Iogansen relationships,
and QTAIM analysis-based Nikolaienko–Bulavin–Hovorun
relationships. These analyses reveal interesting correlations between
the interaction strengths estimated using different relationships
as well as their correlation with the gas-phase interaction energies.
In addition, NCI-RDG analysis provides a graphical visualization of
hydrogen bonds and helps distinguish them from other secondary interactions.

In conclusion, this study characterizes and highlights the rich
diversity of hydrogen-bonding interactions at the rN:protein interface.
Owing to their significant intrinsic strength, we propose that such
interactions should be analyzed in detail while performing molecular
dynamics simulations on rN:protein and RNA:protein macromolecular
complexes.

4 Computational Methods
4.1 Starting
Structures
A set of 16 X-ray
crystal structures of rN:protein pairs involving R, E, or Q and rNs
with resolution better than 2 Å and identified in a previous
study3 were extracted from the Protein
Databank (PDB, Table S1). rN:amino acid
pairs were isolated from these crystal structures using the Rasmol
program.40

4.2 Model
Building
The protein chain
connected to the interacting amino-acid moiety was removed, and the
backbone carbonyl and amide groups were capped with methyl groups.
Methyl capping eliminated the possibility of non-native interactions
between the rN and protein backbone that could potentially occur during
full optimizations of the isolated models in the absence of the rest
of the protein chain. Further, in analogy with previous work,25 the neutral states of both the side-chain carboxylic
group of E and amide group of Q were used for model building, whereas
the side chain of R was taken in its cationic state. Each rN was modeled
as a nucleobase truncating the sugar–phosphate backbone and
replacing it with a hydrogen atom, which was attached to the N9 atom
(purine) or N1 atom (pyrimidine). However, the sugar moiety was retained
in one pair since the interaction of the amino acid residue occurs
through the 2′ OH group of U. Here, the nucleotide was truncated
at the 5′ oxygen, which was capped with a hydrogen atom. Further,
the 3′ oxygen was capped with a methyl group. Furthermore,
hydrogen atoms absent in the crystal structures were added to each
pair to complete the atomic valences.

4.3 Gas-Phase
Calculations
4.3.1 Hydrogen-Only Optimization
and Full Optimization
Due to ambiguity in the positions of
hydrogen atoms added to complete
the atomic valencies, optimization of the hydrogens was carried out
first while fixing the positions of the heavy atoms to the coordinates
derived from crystal structures. This “frozen state”
optimization is denoted as “hydrogen only” optimization.
Each complex was then fully optimized after removing any crystallographic
constraints. Both hydrogen-only optimization and full optimization
were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level using Gaussian 09.41 This method was chosen in analogy with the previous
studies on hydrogen-bonded complexes involving RNA base pairs28−32,38 and base:amino acid complexes.25 The hydrogen-only optimized and fully optimized
geometries were then overlayed to estimate the root mean square deviation
(rmsd) values using the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) program.42

4.3.2 Interaction Energies
Basis set
superposition error (BSSE)-corrected interaction energies of both
hydrogen-only optimized and fully optimized complexes were calculated
at B3LYP/6-311+G(2df,p) using the counterpoise method using Gaussian
09.41 This method was chosen in analogy
with previous studies on hydrogen-bonded systems.25,31,32,43,44 Representative interaction energies were also calculated
using the B3LYP-D3/6-311+G(2df,p) method and compared with the energies
calculated using B3LYP/6-311+G(2df,p) to estimate the effect of dispersion
correction. The energies differ only by 2.7 to 3.7 kcal mol–1 (Table S2). More importantly, the trend
in relative energies does not change upon inclusion of the dispersion
correction.

4.4 Solvent-Phase Optimizations
and Interaction
Energies
The gas-phase optimized structures were reoptimized
in the solvent (water) phase at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) using the integral
equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM) method45 to mimic the solvent environment. These calculations
were carried out using Gaussian 09.37 Further,
the solvent-phase optimized geometries were superposed on the gas-phase
fully optimized geometries to analyze the relative structural deviations
using VMD.42

4.5 Analysis
of the Strength of Individual Hydrogen
Bonds in Gas-Phase Optimized Geometries
4.5.1 Natural
Bond Orbital (NBO) Analysis
To understand the characteristics
and relative strength of hydrogen
bonds occurring in the analyzed complexes, NBO analysis46 was carried out. Specifically, the magnitude
of charge transfer from the donor NBO i (i.e., nonbonding
(lone pair) orbital (n) located on the hydrogen bond
acceptor (A)) to the acceptor NBO j (i.e., antibonding
(σ*) orbital located on the donor–hydrogen (D–H)
bond) associated with each (D–H···A) hydrogen
bond was estimated using the second-order perturbation energy (E(2)), which was deduced from the following equation:  Here, qi is the
occupancy of the donor orbital, Ei and Ej are the energies (diagonal Fock matrix elements)
of orbitals i and j, and F(i, j) is the off-diagonal
NBO Fock matrix element. NBO analysis was carried out using Gaussian
09.41

4.6 Iogansen
Relationship
The strength
of each hydrogen-bonding interaction was further estimated in terms
of hydrogen-bond energy (EHB, kcal mol–1), which was calculated using the Iogansen relationship,47 which has been recently used to successfully
analyze hydrogen bonding in nucleobase pairs.48 Specifically,    Here, Δν is
the difference in
the vibrational frequency of the D–H bond stretching in the
isolated monomer (νmonomer) and hydrogen-bonded complex
(νcomplex). The vibrational frequency calculations
were carried out on the gas-phase fully optimized pairs and isolated
monomers using Gaussian 09.41

4.6.1 Quantum Theory Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM)
Analysis
The strength of hydrogen-bonding interactions within
the pairs was further analyzed using QTAIM analysis.48,49 Specifically, each hydrogen bond was characterized in terms of the
electron density (ρHBCP) and its Laplacian (∇2ρHBCP) at the hydrogen-bond critical point (HBCP). The wave functions
obtained for B3LYP/6-31g(d,p)-optimized geometries were used as input
for these calculations, which were carried out using the Multiwfn
program.50

4.6.2 Nikolaienko–Bulavin–Hovorun
Relationships
EHB was further
estimated for the three (i.e., N–H···O, O–H···O,
and O–H···N) types of hydrogen bonds using the
ρ values obtained from QTAIM analysis and the following Nikolaienko–Bulavin–Hovorun
relations:51      

4.6.3 Noncovalent
Interaction–Reduced Density
Gradient (NCI-RDG) Analysis
For each pair, the reduced density
gradient (S) was calculated from the electron density
(ρ) and its gradient (∇ρ) using the following relationship:52  

In addition, the three components
of
∇2ρ along the three principal axes of maximum
variation (i.e., λ1, λ2, and λ3) were recalculated as the eigenvalues of the electron density
Hessian matrix. Since λ2 < 0 (negative) for hydrogen
bonds, the product of the sign of λ2 and ρ
(i.e., sign(λ2)ρ) is used to characterize different
types of hydrogen bonds.52 NCI-RDG analysis
was performed using the Multiwfn program.50
