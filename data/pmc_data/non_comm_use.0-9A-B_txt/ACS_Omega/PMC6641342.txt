Hollow structures
and doping of rutile TiO2 are generally
believed to be effective ways to enhance the performance of lithium-ion
batteries. Herein, uniformly distributed Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals have been synthesized by a simple template-free
hydrothermal method. A topotactic transformation mechanism of solid
TiOF2 precursor is proposed to illustrate the formation
of rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals. Then, the Sn-doped
rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals are calcined and tested
as anode in the lithium-ion battery. They deliver a highly reversible
specific capacity of 251.3 mA h g–1 at 0.1 A g–1 and retain ∼110 mA h g–1 after 500 cycles at a high current rate 5 A g–1 (30 C), which is much higher than most of the reported work.

1 Introduction
Development
of high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with
wider work-temperature range, increased power density, and improved
safety is highly demanded for future portable electronics and electric
and hybrid vehicles.1,2 Among various anode materials,
TiO2 has been considered as a potential anode candidate
because of excellent Li-ion insertion/extraction reversibility with
a neglectable volume expansion (3–4%) and a high operating
voltage (>1 V vs Li+/Li),3−7 which reduces the excessive formation of solid electrolyte interphase
(SEI) on anodes. In addition, TiO2 is suitable for large-scale
application because of its natural abundance, low cost, and nontoxicity.8 Therefore, various polymorphs of TiO2 (rutile, anatase, brookite, and bronze) have recently been studied
as active materials for LIBs.9 Among them,
rutile TiO2 is the most thermodynamically stable form.10 Unfortunately, the lithium storage performance
of rutile TiO2 is still unsatisfactory, which is mainly
derived from its highly anisotropic diffusion of Li+ in
bulk rutile (10–6 cm2 s–1 along c-axis; 10–15 cm2 s–1 along ab-plane)11,12 and intrinsic limitation of storage capacity.13,14 To enhance the rate capacity, enormous researches have been devoted
to overcome its intrinsic disadvantages. One of those effective approaches
focuses on preparing nanosized hollow rutile TiO2 to shorten
the transport path for both Li+ ions and electrons in TiO2 nanostructures.15−17 The hollow interior also provides
an extra free space that can alleviate the structural strain and accommodate
the volume variation. It is associated with the repeated Li+ ions insertion/extraction process, leading to the improved cycling
stability.18,19 Another effective strategy is
to dope alien atoms (e.g., C, N, B, Fe, Nb, Mn, Sn, etc.) in TiO2.8,20−27 The doping method is attracting more attention because it not only
benefits the electron-transfer process but also offers more channels
for Li+ diffusion due to the slightly modified lattice
of the doped TiO2.24 Sn4+ is taken as an example because the theoretical capacity
of SnO2 (≈790 mA h g–1) is much
higher than that of rutile TiO2.28,2928,29 Sn(IV)-ion doping into rutile TiO2 at
the atomic level can anticipate improved electrochemical performance
with increased capacity and higher retention.

Although many
kinds of rutile TiO2 nanostructures with
different morphologies have been intensively investigated, synthesis
of hollow nanocrystals is still a great challenge by a template-free
method.30 Herein, we report the preparation
of Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals by a facile
template-free hydrothermal method. When measured as anode in lithium-ion
batteries, the Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals
exhibit a greatly improved electrochemical performance, including
a high specific capacity, an excellent rate property, and a long-life
cycling stability. This material showed a much enhanced capacity of
251.3 mA h g–1 after 150 cycles under 0.1 A g–1. Furthermore, a reversible capacity of ∼110
mA h g–1 after 500 cycles at 5 A g–1 (30 C) can still be retained and the Coulombic efficiency (CE) maintained
almost 100% during the 500 cycles, confirming the excellent rate property
of the Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals. The excellent
lithium-ion storage performance benefits from hollow nanostructures,
high crystallinity, and uniform Sn-ion doping.

2 Experimental
Sections
2.1 Preparation of the Sn-Doped Rutile TiO2 Hollow Nanocrystals
The Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals were obtained via a facile template-free
hydrothermal method. In a typical process, 4 mmol SnCl4·5H2O was dissolved in 20 mL tetrabutyl titanate
(TBOT) and vigorously stirred for 10 min. 4.5 mL HF solution (30%)
was then added drop by drop in it. The solution was then transferred
into a 40 mL Teflon tube and sealed into the autoclave, which was
heated to 200 °C for 24 h. The obtained products were washed
several times with ethanol and water after cooling to the room temperature.
Finally, they were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to remove the impurities.
To investigate its growth process, time-dependent experiments were
carried out for 10, 18, and 24 h, respectively. In addition, different
amounts (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mmol) of SnCl4·5H2O were also introduced to illustrate the formation of pure
Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals.

2.2 Electrochemical Characterization
Electrochemical measurements
were carried out by using LIR2032 coin
cells.31 The working electrode consisted
of active material, acetylene black (super-P) and poly(vinylidene
fluoride) with the weight ratio of 8:1:1. The assembly of the coin
cells was performed in a glove box full of Ar. The Celgard 2400 film
was used as separator. The electrolyte was composed of ethylene carbonate,
dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and ethylene methyl carbonate, with the
volume ratio of 1:1:1 as solvent and LiPF6 as solute with
the concentration of 1 mol L–1. The counter electrode
of the coin cells was mainly composed of pure lithium foil. The galvanostatic
charge/discharge curve of the coin cells was obtained on a LAND Cell
Test system in a setting voltage range (2001A, Wuhan, China). A CHI760D
electrochemical working station was used to carry out the cyclic voltammetry
(CV) tests in the same setting voltage range with the charge/discharge
test rate of 0.2 mV s–1. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) patterns were studied by using the same working
station in the CV tests. The frequency range was set from 100 kHz
to 0.01 Hz, with an amplitude of 5 mV. After the cycle performance
test, the coin cells were disassembled and washed with dimethyl carbonate
(DMC) to remove the electrolyte from the electrode surface. After
that, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 24 h before examination.

2.3 Characterization Methods
X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-obtained samples were recorded
on a Rigaku D/Max-γ A X-ray diffractometer with the scanning
rate of 4° min–1. Morphologies of the samples
were examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800),
transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL H-7000), and high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100). The element
analysis was carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS,
ESCALAB 250). The Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimeter 2000 analyzer
was used to measure the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific
surface area of the sample.

3 Results
and Discussion
The phase composition of Sn-doped TiO2 sample was confirmed
by XRD (Figure 1a). All of the diffraction peaks can be indexed
to rutile TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1276), and no other peaks
corresponding to SnO2 were observed in the XRD pattern,
preliminary indicating effective doping of tin in rutile TiO2 lattice. It is noted that the peaks slightly shifted to smaller
angles, as observed by Rogach et al.25,32 The lattice
expansion is attributed to a substitution of the Ti site in the rutile
by Sn due to a larger ionic radius of Sn4+ (55 pm) than
that of Ti4+ (42 pm).33Figure 1b–d shows
the typical TEM images of Sn-doped rutile TiO2 with a size
of 100–150 nm. The nanocrystals have clear hollow interior
voids, with some holes on their surfaces (Figure S1), which is possibly derived from the etching of HF solution.
The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern corresponding
to the single hollow nanocrystal demonstrates its single-crystalline
nature (inset in Figure 1e). The HRTEM image exhibits clear lattice fringes, indicating high
crystallinity of the nanocrystal (Figure 1e). The lattice spacing is ∼0.33 nm,
corresponding to the (110) plane of rutile TiO2.13

Actually, when no Sn precursor was added to the
starting solution,
only anatase TiO2 nanosheets were prepared (Figures 2a and S2). Incorporation of Sn element into TiO2 lattice
was accompanied with a phase transformation from anatase to rutile
(Figure 2b,c). When
2 mmol SnCl4·5H2O was dissolved in TBOT,
it is noticed that some hollow nanocrystals (labeled by arrow in Figure 2b) appeared in the
sample of anatase TiO2 nanosheets. The analysis of phase
composition reveals the coexistence of anatase and rutile TiO2 (Figure S2). Furthermore, the
anatase nanosheets were completely converted into Sn-doped rutile
hollow nanocrystals with the injection of 4 mmol SnCl4·5H2O, which was also supported by the XRD pattern in Figure S2. Only rutile TiO2 sample
was synthesized in the condition. However, excessive Sn precursor
easily resulted in phase separation of TiO2 and SnO2. As shown in Figure 2d–f, a large amount of SnO2 nanocrystals
uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of TiO2 nanosheets.
The emergence of TiO2 nanosheets instead of hollow nanocrystals
means that the rutile TiO2 returned back to anatase phase.
The corresponding XRD patterns in Figure S2 supported the reverse transformation and the appearance of SnO2. The quantum dots, uniformly deposited on anatase TiO2 nanosheets, were measured by HRTEM (Figure 2f). The lattice spacing was ∼0.339
nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of SnO2. Therefore,
a Sn precursor, however, with very narrow range of Sn4+ concentration, plays a crucial role in the formation of pure Sn-doped
rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals. In addition, for eliminating
the effect of Cl– for the formation of rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals, several kinds of metal chlorides were
introduced instead of SnCl4 in this reaction. As a result,
only anatase TiO2 products could be synthesized (Figure S3), which further illustrates the effect
of doping of Sn.

(b) 2 mmol, (c) 4 mmol, (d) 6 mmol, and (e) 8 mmol SnCl4·5H2O; (f) HRTEM image of SnO2 quantum
dots from (e).

To further validate the
Sn doping in rutile TiO2 hollow
nanocrystals, a STEM image of single nanocrystal was recorded (Figure 3a). The corresponding
EDS elemental mappings were conducted to reveal the elemental composition
and distribution status in the hollow nanocrystal. Figure 3b–d confirms that Sn
element was homogeneously dispersed in the TiO2 hollow
nanocrystal. As mentioned above, the as-obtained rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals have smooth surfaces and clear lattice fringes
(Figure S4). Therefore, it can be concluded
that the Sn element was well doped into the rutile TiO2 lattice.

is 100 nm.

The molar ratio of Sn element
in TiO2 sample was 8.7%,
as calculated by fitting of XPS spectra. The peaks centered at 487.0
and 494.9 eV can be indexed to Sn 3d peaks (Figure 4a),34,35 corresponding to Sn4+ bound to oxygen in the Sn-doped rutile TiO2.
Because of the structural similarity between the rutile SnO2 and TiO2 (Figure S5 and Table S1),10,14,36 the Sn elements
would occupy a part of the Ti sites in the doping process. In Figure 4b, the slightly asymmetric
spectrum of O 1s can be resolved into three peaks. The O 1s peaks
centered at 529.5 and 530.1 eV can be typically assigned to Ti–O
bond in the rutile TiO2 structure37,38 and the Sn–O bond,31 respectively.
The peak at 532.05 may result from the band of the adsorbed hydroxyl
(−OH) groups on the nanomaterial surface.31 Ti 2p peaks (Figure 4c) of the Sn-doped rutile TiO2 show two peaks,
corresponding to Ti4+ (Ti 2p1/2 at 464.6 eV
and Ti 2p3/2 at 458.7 eV).37−39 The UV–vis spectrum
of Sn-doped rutile TiO2 presented a narrowed band gap of
∼0.1 eV compared to that of pure rutile TiO2 (Figure S6), which was consistent with the theoretical
simulation (Figures S7 and S8).

To shed light on the formation process of the rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals, experiments were carried out at 200
°C
for different reaction times to monitor the morphology evolution of
nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 5a, solid nanocrystals were obtained for 10 h, which
were indexed to be TiOF2 (JCPDS No. 08-0060) by the corresponding
XRD pattern (Figure 5b). When the reaction time was extended to 18 h (Figure 5c,d), some new diffraction
peaks, corresponding to the rutile TiO2, also appeared
besides the peaks of TiOF2, indicating the conversion from
TiOF2 precursor to rutile TiO2. This is possibly
due to the hydrolysis of TiOF2.40−43 More importantly, a part of solid
TiOF2 nanocrystals transformed into hollow structures,
which still kept the similar external morphologies. The conversion
process reflected that the formation of hollow nanocrystals through
in situ transformation of TiOF2 precursor.43 The phase transformation from TiOF2 to rutile
TiO2 was completed within 24 h. Then, uniform TiO2 hollow nanocrystals were obtained (Figure 5e,f).

as-obtained products at
different time duration: (a, b) 10 h, (c, d) 18 h, and (e, f) 24 h.
The scale bar is 200 nm.

Furthermore, a sacrificial self-template mechanism was proposed
to illustrate the formation process of rutile TiO2 hollow
nanocrystals.44,45 First, the Sn-doped TiOF2 crystallites (Figures 6 and S9) were gradually hydrolyzed
to form Sn-doped TiO2 nanocrystals in a hydrothermal reaction.42 These primary nanocrystals uniformly deposited
on the surfaces of Sn-doped TiOF2 crystallites (Figure S10) and then formed TiO2 shells.
Because of the restriction from the template, the as-obtained rutile
TiO2 showed the same shape with the TiOF2 precursor.
The TiO2 shells became thicker with the increasing reaction
time, whereas the solid TiOF2 templates were continually
consumed inward. Finally, the TiOF2 precursor completely
disappeared. Therefore, the template-engaged topotactic transformation
mechanism is responsible for the formation of rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals.46,47 When no SnCl4 was
added in the reaction system, only anatase TiO2 nanosheets
can be obtained. Excessive SnCl4 easily led to the formation
of SnO2 quantum dots instead of doping in the rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals.

Sn-doped TiO2 hollow nanocrystals via the template-engaged
topotactic transformation
process from Sn-doped TiOF2 precursor.

The lithium storage properties of the Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals were then evaluated. Figure 7a shows the representative
discharge–charge
curves of the crystals during the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 150th cycle at
a voltage range from 0.01 to 3.0 V with a current rate of 0.1 A g–1. Two major voltage plateaus at ∼1.4 and ∼1.0
V vs Li/Li+ are presented in the first discharge curve,
consistent with other rutile TiO2 electrodes.22,48 The results were also supported by the CV results (Figure S11), which are related to the Li+ insertion
into the octahedral sites of the TiO6 octahedrons.49 Despite the two major peaks in the CV patterns,
some unknown peaks have also been observed, which are possibly derived
from some side reactions in the electrode. In addition, the absence
of peaks at ∼0.6 and ∼1.3 V, which are characteristic
of the dealloying process of LixSn and
the partially reversible reaction of SnO2 with Li+,50−53 thus, indicates the uniform doping of tin in the rutile TiO2 lattice. A high initial capacity of 596.9 mA h g–1 is exhibited in the initial discharge process, which is much higher
than the theoretical capacity of the pure rutile TiO2 (TiO2 + xLi + xe– → LixTiO2 (x ≤ 1)).8 The hollow structures
with a high specific surface area and a large pore volume (Figure S12) and doping of tin offer more active
sites for Li+ storage.18,54,55 In the following process, a capacity of 337.9 mA
h g–1 was obtained. The irreversible capacity loss
is about 43.4%. This can be derived from the deep trapping of inserted
Li+ after large volume strain in the crystal structure,
as well as the formation of SEI film.48 After the first several cycles, the specific capacity of the Sn-doped
rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals electrode is stabilized
(Figure 7b). In the
second charge/discharge cycle, a discharge capacity of 337.9 mA h
g–1 is delivered, followed by a charge capacity
of 333.9 mA h g–1, leading to a high Coulombic efficiency
(CE) of about 98.8%. The discharge capacity sustains at about 251.3
mA h g–1 after 150 cycles at a current rate of 0.1
A g–1, which is superior to most other nanostructured
rutile TiO2-based anode materials (Table S2). Because SnO2 has a higher theoretical
capacity than TiO2, Sn4+ doping in the rutile
TiO2 lattice naturally leads to an enhanced reversible
capacity (Li+ + SnO2 → Sn + Li2O; Sn + xLi → LixSn (x < 4.4)).51,53 In addition,
annealing treatment also benefited the increase in Li+ storage
property in the prepared Sn-doped TiO2 hollow nanocrystals
(Figure 7b). This is
due to the improved crystallinity and absence of side reactions, related
with the oxygen vacancies, after annealing. In comparison, the undoped
TiO2 nanosheets were also synthesized via a similar hydrothermal
method without SnCl4 in the reaction system, which exhibited
inferior electrochemical activity (Figure S13). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement is carried
out to study the charge-transfer impedance of Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals electrode (Figure 7c). The Nyquist plots of the annealed and
unannealed hollow nanocrystals are obtained with the amplitude of
5 mV and a frequency ranging from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. It is clear
that the semicircle of the annealed Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals is smaller than that of the unannealed ones,
demonstrating a smaller solid-state interface resistance of the sample
after annealing. Inset in Figure 7c shows an equivalent circuit. The small intercept
(Rs) at the Z/ axis represents the total resistance of the electrolyte, separator,
and electrical contacts.53 The semicircle
corresponds to R1, representing charge-transfer
impedance on the electrode–electrolyte interface.4 The sloping line, corresponding to W (Warburg impedance), indicates the diffusion of Li+ into
the active materials.2 The CPE1 is the constant phase-angle element, involving double-layer capacitance,
which is relevant with the surface property of the electrode.52C1 represents the
capacitance caused by Li+ transport process in the electrode
material.16 The R1 of annealed Sn-doped TiO2 hollow nanocrystals
was 64.11 Ω cm–2, which is much smaller than
that of unannealed electrode (160.9 Ω cm–2) and means well charge transport property on the electrode–electrolyte
surface. It is due to the doping of Sn4+ and high crystallinity.
The improved conductivity benefits the electrons and Li+ transport in the electrode.8 Meanwhile,
the hollow nanostructures can offer more sites for ions insertion.
Therefore, a high specific capacity can be expected.

curves of them during the 1st,
2nd, 5th, and 150th cycle; (b) cycle performances at 100 mA g–1 in the 0.01–3 V range of the annealed and
unannealed Sn-doped rutile TiO2; (c) electrochemical impedance
spectroscopies of annealed and unannealed Sn-doped rutile TiO2; (d) rate capabilities of the annealed and unannealed rutile
TiO2 at a current density ranging from 100 to 5000 mA h
g–1; (e) the cycling performance of annealed Sn-doped
rutile TiO2 at the rate of 5000 mA h g–1 (30 C, 1 C = 173 mA g–1).

The excellent rate behavior of the sample was further investigated
at different current rates (0.1–5 A g–1; Figure 7d). Ten charge/discharge
cycles were tested at each step from 0.1 to 5 A g–1. Obviously, the Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals
exhibited much more improved rate performances than unannealed sample
at each current rate. The specific capacities for Sn-doped rutile
TiO2 hollow nanocrystals are 313.4, 291.4, 256.5, 235.5,
and 201.4 mA h g–1 at the rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
1, and 2 A g–1, respectively. Moreover, even at
the highest current of 5 A g–1, a high capacity
of 155.6 mA h g–1 is still obtained. Furthermore,
the capacity can be returned to the initial value of 295.6 mA h g–1 after measuring at high current rate of 30 C, indicating
their good structural stability. To evaluate the cyclability at a
high current rate, the Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals
electrode was discharged–charged at 30 C over 500 cycles. It
is clear that this sample retained a reversible capacity of ∼110
mA h g–1 after 500 cycles at about 30 C (Figure 7e). The CE remained
almost 100% during the 500 cycles, indicating excellent stability
of the electrode. More importantly, the hollow structure of Sn-doped
rutile TiO2 nanocrystals was well maintained after 100
cycles under 1 A g–1, which further illuminates
the stability of the electrode56 (Figure S14). In comparison with the reported
rutile TiO2, the Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow
nanocrystals exhibited significant rate capabilities and cycling stability
(Table S2).

4 Conclusions
In summary, Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals
were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The
hollow nanostructures were transformed from solid TiOF2 nanocrystals by hydrolysis. Owing to tin doping, uniform hollow
structure, and high crystallinity, the TiO2 products demonstrated
remarkable rate capabilities and excellent long-life cycling stability
at a high current rate. They delivered a high reversible specific
capacity of 251.3 mA h g–1 at the current rate of
0.1 A g–1. Moreover, they still exhibited as high
as ∼110 mA h g–1 over 500 cycles at the current
rate of 5 A g–1 (30 C). These electrochemical performances
are superior to those of most rutile TiO2 reported so far.
Therefore, it is expected that the Sn-doped rutile TiO2 hollow nanocrystals will be a potential candidate as the anode material.
