A simple and cost-effective material
composed of polyacrylonitrile
nanofibers containing different concentrations of moringa (MR) leaf
extracts was fabricated for antimicrobial properties and wound dressing.
The fabricated materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy,
thermal gravimetric analysis, and Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy.
The antibacterial sensitivity of the developed polyacrylonitrile-moringa
extract nanofibers was evaluated against Staphylococcus
aureus and Escherichia coli by the agar diffusion method. A pronounced antibacterial activity
was observed with the increase in the incorporated moringa leaf extract
concentration within the polyacrylonitrile-moringa extract nanofibers
against the bacterial strains. The best antibacterial sensitivity
was observed for nanofibers containing 0.5 g of moringa leaf extract
which had an inhibitory zone of 15 mm for E. coli and 12 mm for S. aureus. Furthermore,
the cost-effective and biodegradable nanofibrous polyacrylonitrile–moringa
extract nanofiber was also used to conduct further studies regarding
wound dressing. The result reveals that the increase in the concentrations
of moringa leaf extract influenced the healing properties of the material.
For days 1, 4, and 7 of the wound dressing experiment, the % wound
closure of the rat was the highest for the nanofiber containing 0.5
g of moringa leaf extract (35, 87, and 95%, respectively) compared
to the positive control medical gauze (29, 75, and 93%, respectively).

1 Introduction
Polymer nanofibers have
been reported to have wide applications
in the field of nanotechnology.1,2 Nanofibers can be produced
by using a simple, versatile, and widely applied method known as electrospinning.3 The morphology of the nanofibers produced can
be influenced by parameters such as applied voltage, viscosity of
solution flow rate, and distance of the collector from the syringe.4−7 Nanofibers obtained via this method from different polymers have
proven to have potential applications in medicine8 and environmental applications9 such as electrochemical sensors for organochlorine pesticides,10 drug delivery, and food processing.11 Green synthesis and fabrication of nanofibers
with extracts from plants have also been explored.12−14 Recently, electrospun
nanofibers have been used as materials for wound dressing because
of high oxygen porosity of the materials and also the possession of
different pore sizes, high surface/volume ratio, and similar texture
to the natural extracellular matrix in the skin, which promotes the
wound healing process.15−17 Polymer nanofibers can be used either with or without
any additives or in combination with bioactive plant extracts.18,19

Some of these polymers have properties such as biocompatibility
and biodegradability. Biodegradable polymers could be classified into
synthetic and natural polymers. Both synthetic and natural biodegradable
polymers have been used for drug delivery, and some have been developed
for clinical applications. The ease of transformation of some of these
polymers into nanofibers has encouraged researchers to explore the
possible applications available for these nanomaterials.20 Polyacrylonitrile falls among the list of very
important polymeric materials because of its easy fiber formation
by electrospinning with unique mechanical, thermal stability, and
good solvent resistance properties.21 Biodegradability
property of some polymers can be improved by reacting them with other
biodegradable materials.22 The synthesis
and characterization of biodegradable composites of polyacrylonitrile
have been reported for various applications and can form composites
with other materials including the extract from various parts of plants.22−25 Polyacrylonitrile has also been used as good anode materials for
LIBs,26 electrodes for coin cell supercapacitors,27 as biocatalytic O2 reduction,28 degradation of rhodamine,29 and wound dressing.30

Plants with antiproliferative, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties
have been used in the treatment of wounds. Examples of such plants
are Aloe vera, Moringa
oleifera, and Kigelia africana. They are often delivered in the form of ointment on the affected
region.31 Bioactive plant extracts from
plants such as M. oleifera, a species
of monogeneric family Moringaceae,32,33 contains phytochemicals
such as phenolics, zeatin, kaempferom, quercetin, and amino acids.
Specifically, the protein isolates from the M. oleifera leaf, which is confirmed to be a biodegradable film consists of
niazirin, niazirinin, 4-[4′-O-acetyl-α-l-rhamnosyloxy) benzyl-isothiocyanate, and niaziminin A and
B.34,35 Traditionally, the plant has found applications
in pharmaceuticals such as cardiac and circulatory drugs and antipyretic,
antiulcer, antiinflammatory, antiepileptic, antispasmodic, diuretic,
antihypertensive, cholesterol lowering, hepatoprotective, antioxidant,
antidiabetic, antibacterial, and antifungal drugs.36,37

A wound is described as an injury either to the skin, underlying
tissues or organs which are caused by physical, chemical, thermal,
microbial, and immunological abuse.38,39 Furthermore,
the wound is usually accompanied by vasoconstriction which induces
homeostasis and release of inflammation mediators.40,41 Another major concerns with wound is the high risk of infections.
Bacterial organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus,Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus spp are a group of bacteria that often colonizes
the wound and cause infections within 48 h40,41 when exposed. Wound healing is therefore a biochemical and physiological
process of repairing the damaged tissue to its almost normal state.42 Wound healing is usually characterized by reformulations
and improvements in the components of the collagen fibers that increase
the tensile strength of the tissues.43−46

Nanofiber membranes of
different polymers such as polyvinylacetate,
poly(ε-caprolactone), and polyacrylonitrile have been used as
wound-dressing materials. The results showed that the nanofiber membranes
were high in mechanical strength and therefore facilitated the healing
process.47 An ideal polymer to be used
for wound dressing therefore must possess properties such as noncytotoxic,
biodegradable, impermeable to bacteria, hemocompatible, easy to remove,
and capable of maintaining the moisture content over the wound surface.48 Other properties are antibacterial activity,
odor-absorbing properties, ability to remove chronic wound fluid,
and effective wound-cleansing activity.48 Polyacrylonitrile with other polymers such as polyvinylchloride
was reported to exhibit strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and E. coli that can cause wound infections.46

However, the available skin substitutes used in wound healing causes
problems such as wound contraction, scar formation, and poor integration
with the host tissue.49 The properties
of nanofibers make them suitable for burns and wound healing. Their
large surface area also increases the close interaction of therapeutic
agents and exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with tissues and
provides the mechanism for sustained release and delivery of plant-derived
remedies, analgesics, antibiotics, and growth factors needed for burns
and wound healing.50

Therefore, this
study reports the fabrication and characterization
of polyacrylonitrile nanofibers containing different concentrations
of moringa leaf extracts for wound healing. The materials were characterized
by Fourier transmission infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron
microscope (SEM), XRD, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The
wound healing properties of different concentrations of moringa leaf
extracts in the nanofibers were investigated using animal models.
The antibacterial potentials of moringa leaf extract-functionalized
nanofibers against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria strains were investigated using
Agar diffusion methods.

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Spectroscopy and Morphology Characterization
Nanofibers
The results of FTIR spectroscopic characterization
of the functional groups present in the electrospun nanofiber of polyacrylonitrile
only and nanofibers with 0.5 g concentration of moringa leaf extract
are shown in Figure 1. The spectra for polyacrylonitrile nanofibers only show absorption
peaks at 2949–3014 cm–1 attributed to C–H
bonds in CH, CH2, and CH3,54 while another peak at 2245 cm–1 is the
characteristic peak confirming the presence of nitrile C≡N
bonds and nitrile groups present in polyacrylonitrile. Peaks observed
at 1736 and 1198 cm–1 are assigned to C=O
or CO, respectively.55 Other peaks observed
are CH stretching at 2933 and 1633–1546 cm–1 due to the amide I and amide II regions. Also observed is the amine
(C–N) stretch vibrational band around 1050 cm–1 and carbonyl group CHO stretching at 1756 cm–1, and the band at 1076 cm–1 is the C–O stretching
vibration confirming the presence of alcohols and carboxylic acid
groups in the moringa leaf extract present in the polyacrylonitrile
nanofiber. Similar peaks were observed in the spectra for the other
concentrations (graph not shown).

only and (b) polyacrylonitrile
+0.5 g MR leaf extracts.

The SEM morphology of the polyacrylonitrile nanofiber and
that
of polyacrylonitrile with different concentrations of moringa leaf
extracts were carried out to observe any change in morphology of the
polymer nanofibers. The SEM images of polyacrylonitrile only and polymer
containing 0.5 g of moringa leaf extracts are shown in Figure 2. The SEM image shows that
the morphology of the polymer nanofibers is cylindrical, smooth, and
evenly distributed. The morphology remains almost the same after the
incorporation of different concentrations of the leaf extract (SEM
images of other concentrations not shown). It was observed that as
the concentration of the leaf extract increases the viscosity of the
electrospinnable solution decreases, which gives rise to beaded nanofibers
as seen in Figure 2b.56

Figure 2 SEM morphology of 16 wt % (a) polyacrylonitrile
only and (b) polyacrylonitrile
with 0.5 g moringa leaf extract.

2.1.1 Thermal Analysis on Nanofibers
Thermogravimetry
was employed in order to determine the weight loss
pattern of the polyacrylonitrile and the composite fibers as a function
of temperature. Figure 3 shows the TGA curves of pure polyacrylonitrile and the polymer nanofibers
at different percentage loadings. About three-step degradation processes
have been identified, which are characterized by an exothermic reaction
typical of polyacrylonitrile for both the pure polymer nanofibers
and polymer nanofibers with different concentrations of moringa extracts.57 The three-stage degradation process involves
the following: (i) the formation of rings among adjacent CN functional
groups in the polyacrylonitrile structure. This process is reported
to increase the thermal stability of the compound58 and (ii) the decomposition of the rest fiber. In this stage,
the effect of the addition of the moringa leaf extract becomes conspicuous
as a slight temperature difference between the polyacrylonitrile and
its composite is observed. In the third stage (iii), the residue left
after the thermal decomposition showed increments which varied linearly
with the percentage of moringa extract loading. The thermal stability
of the nanocomposites showed improvement in the high-temperature region
even with the lowest moringa extract concentration. This indicates
a good interaction between polyacrylonitrile and the extract, thus
resulting in the enhancement in thermal stability.

16 wt % polyacrylonitrile nanofibers (A)

extract.

2.2 Wound
Healing Studies
In the wound
healing study, skin incisions on the rats dorsal with an area of 0.8
cm2 were treated using a commercial antibacterial gauze
(positive control, tagged F), nanofibers (negative control, tagged
A), and nanofibers having different concentrations of moringa extracts
incorporated (tagged B, C, D, and E). The % wound closure at 1, 4,
7, and 10 days of treatment is presented in Figure 4. The histology results (Figure 4) revealed that all groups
showed improved healing with the wounded skin being completely re-epithelialized
at day 11.

Figure 4 Wound closure (%) at 1, 4, 7, and 10 days after treatment (A–F,
where A is polyacrylonitrile nanofibers only, B–E are polymer
nanofibers with 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.5 g moringa extracts, respectively,
and F is the positive control). The data are expressed as mean ±
standard deviation from six independent experiments. *Statistically
significant (p < 0.05).

At day 1, among the rats treated with the nanofibers, E (group
E) showed the highest % wound closure among all other rat groups.
This was even higher than those treated with the commercial antibacterial
gauze, F. This trend was also observed at days 4 and 7. Interestingly,
among the group treated with the negative control nanofibers, A also
showed some wound closure property but not as much as those treated
with nanofibers with moringa extracts in groups B–E. This is
consistent with other reported literature.15,49 The percentage wound closure for all the groups A–F increased
gradually as the treatment time increases. For days 1, 4, and 7, the
% wound closure was the highest for group E (35, 87, and 95% respectively)
compared to the positive control at group F (29, 75, and 93% respectively)
and other groups (p < 0.05). At day 10, group
B showed the highest wound closure though not significant to groups
C, D, and E. Group A showed the lowest wound closure compared with
control and other groups (p < 0.05).

Figure 5 shows the
histological images of the wounded skin from different groups. The
images for that of groups A–E showed a concentration-dependent
healing process as group E showed the best wound healing ability with
complete re-epithelialization as well as almost completely healed
wound, and almost intact arrangement of collagenous fibers in the
dermis. As the concentration of the moringa extract content in the
nanofibers increased, there is a corresponding increase in the % wound
closure. This could be attributed to the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,36 and antimicrobial37 properties of the moringa extract which improved the wound healing
process of the injured rats. The result also showed that group A (which
is the group treated with only nanofibers) had the least healing process
observed.

nanofibers only, B–E are polymer nanofibers with 0.1, 0.15,
0.2, and 0.5 g moringa extracts, respectively, and F is the positive
control.

2.3 Antibacterial
Studies
The antimicrobial
properties of M. oleifera plant extracts
have been extensively studied and reported.36,37M. oleifera extracts also have a
potent inhibitory effect against multidrug-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus.59 The polyacrylonitrile
nanofiber mats (containing 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.5 g of M. oleifera and 16 wt % polymer) were evaluated for
their antibacterial properties against S. aureus and E. coli. The nanofiber mats loaded
with M. oleifera extracts (B–E)
exhibited concentration-dependent antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli as shown in Table 1 and Figure 6. The
nanofiber mat (E) loaded with 0.5 g of M. oleifera extracts exhibited the best antibacterial property compared to the
other nanofibers. The nanofiber mat (A) without M.
oleifera extracts incorporated had the least antibacterial
activity. The results indicated that the M. oleifera extracts still retained its antibacterial activity, and even enhanced
activities was observed despite been processed by electrospinning;
as a consequence, nanofibers B–E exhibited antibacterial activities.

3 Conclusions
In the present study, different
concentrations of moringa extracts
were incorporated into polyacrylonitrile nanofiber mats using the
electrospinning process. The fiber mats provided suitable, simple,
and cost-effective materials that were used in wound healing and antibacterial
experiments. The wound healing experiment showed that nanofibers with
different concentrations of moringa extracts (groups B–E) gave
better wound healing properties compared to the usage of only the
nanofiber (group A) because of the presence of the leaf extract with
active functional groups. It also showed that the healing properties
of the nanofibers (B–E) were a function of treatment time and
concentration of the moringa extract as there was gradual skin re-epithelialization
as the treatment days and concentration of the moringa extract increased,
respectively. The nanofiber with 16 wt % of polyacrylonitrile and
0.5 g of moringa extract (E) gave the best wound healing property
which was even better than the commercial gauze (Steri-tulle, Yangzhou,
CN). Similarly, the antibacterial studies showed that S. aureus and E. coli were susceptible to nanofibers with incorporated moringa extracts
(groups B–E). The antibacterial results also reflected concentration-dependent
activities as increase in the concentration of M. oleifera extracts loaded in the nanofibers resulted in increased antibacterial
activities. These antibacterial electrospun nanofiber mats have promising
potential for use as effective wound dressings.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials for Preparation and Characterization
of Fabricated Nanofibers
Polyacrylonitrile, moringa leaf,
ethanol, dimethyl formaldehyde, and other reagents used were of analytical
grade. Sixty Wistar rats were acquired from Animal house of the College
of Basic Medical Sciences, Cross River State University of Science
and Technology, Nigeria, including reagents such as ketamine hydrochloride,
diazepam, alcohol, iodine, aspirin, and distilled water. The fabricated
nanofiber were characterized by using a FT-IR spectrometer attached
to a PerkinElmer Auto Image Microscope System equipped with a liquid
nitrogen cooled MCT detector; morphological images were obtained by
using field emission scanning electron microscopy purchased from JEOL
JSM 5800 LV (Japan), and the thermal stability of the nanomaterials
were determined by using the TGA.

4.2 Fabrication
of Polyacrylonitrile Nanofibers
Containing Moringa Leaf Extract Nanofibers
The nanofibers
were fabricated by dissolving different concentrations of moringa
leaf extracts into 16 wt % polyacrylonitrile. Each products were labeled
A–E, where A is polyacrylonitrile nanofiber only amd B–E
are nanofibers containing 16 wt % polymer and 0.1, 0.15, 0.25 and
0.5 g moringa extract, respectively. The polymer solutions were taken
into 20 mL syringe with the needle and the tip of the needle being
connected to a high voltage power supply of 20 kV, and nanofibers
were collected on the aluminum foil collector plate at a distance
of 10 cm from the needle. Electrospinning was performed at room temperature
at a feed rate of 0.15 mL/h. The removal of the solvent and water
from the electrospun samples was carried out by drying the nanofibers
at room temperature for 24 h.

4.3 Wound
Healing Experiment
The experiment
involved 36 healthy Wistar rats with weights between the range of
150–200 g according to the methods reported in literature.51 The Wistar rats were allowed to familiarize
with their new environment for a week and were fed on standard rat
pellets and water ad libitum. The assembling of the rats was done
in six groups, namely, A, B, C, D, E and F, with six rats in each
group and housed in individual compartment of plastic cages. The caring
guidelines given in NIH for rats and laboratory animals were strictly
followed in the handling of the rats used for this study.52

4.3.1 Induction of Skin Lesion
on the Animals
The animals used for the study had no pre-existing
skin lesion.
Before the commencement of the surgical proceedings, the animals were
weighed individually and recorded. The anesthetics used were 10% ketamine
hydrochloride (Rotexmedica, 0.1 mL/kg body weight) and diazepam (0.1
mL/kg body weight) and were administered intramuscularly. An imaginary
line was drawn from the shavened right dorsolateral aspect of the
thoracic wall of the animals from the lower margin of the ear. The
area was cleaned with antisepsis. In the center of the shaved area,
a surgical skin lesion of 0.8 cm by 0.8 cm area of the skin was measured
and excised by exposing the dorsal muscle fascia with the aid of a
surgical scalpel. Care was taken to remove the panniculus carnosus.
100 mg/kg weight of aspirin was given to the rats for pain control.

4.3.1.1 Procedures for Wound Dressing
Scheme 1 represents
the wound dressing procedures used for this work. Rats in groups A,
B, C, D, and E had their wounds dressed with nanofiber patches, whereas
the wound of rats in group F was dressed with a commercial gauze (Steri-tulle,
Yangzhou, CN) which also served as our positive control. The nanofibers
used for group A rats contained only 16 wt % polyacrylonitrile nanofibers
with no moringa extract which was used as the negative control. The
nanofibers used for groups B to E rats contained 16 wt % polymer and
0.1, 0.15, 0.25 and 0.5 g moringa extract, respectively. The nanofibers
and the commercial gauze were secured over the wounds of the animals
as shown in Scheme 1. The dressing of the wound was carried out every 2 days. The area
of the wound was measured every 2 days. The percentage of wound closure
was determined by using eq 1. 1  where Ai is the
initial wound area and A is the wound area after
a fixed time interval.

Scheme 1 Schematic Diagram of Nanofiber Application
for Wound Healing
The capturing of the images of the skin wounds for the
whole process
in the study was done by using a digital camera (14.1 megapixels)
at a distance of 15 cm. The photos of the wound surface were imported
onto ImageJ software. The pictures were calibrated in millimeters
with the aid of a rule included into the image taken. The area around
the wound surface were drawn with a freehand tool on ImageJ and measured
in mm2.

4.4 Histological
Examination
The rats
used for the study were sacrificed at the 11th day under the use of
ether anesthesia. 10% buffered formalin was used to preserve and store
the specimens of the wound area. Slices of 5 μm were marked
with hematoxylin–eosin for the demonstration of skin architecture
of the rats, and Masson trichrome was used for the demonstration of
collagen fibers. The inspection of these sections was carried out
by using the Leica DM750 microscope with a digital camera attached.
Digital photomicrographs of the tissue sections were taken at 100×
magnification.

4.5 Antibacterial Activity
The antibacterial
sensitivity of the nanofibers (A–E) to S. aureus (S. aureus) and E.
coli (E. coli) using
the agar diffusion method. The choice of the bacterial organisms was
due to their relevance to wound infections. The Petri discs contained
20 mL of sterile Mueller–Hinton agar. The bacterial suspension
of approximately 1 × 106 cfu/mL was swabbed on the
solidified agar media and left to dry for 15 min. Thereafter, 5 mg
of the nanofibers was placed on each disc. The loaded discs were left
for 30 min at room temperature for compound diffusion. The plates
were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and closely monitored for the
development of clear zones around the nanofibers. The antibacterial
sensitivity was judged by the diameter of the zone of inhibition in
millimeters. The experiment was repeated twice, and 1 mg/mL streptomycin
was used as a positive control. The experiment was done twice, and
the antibacterial results treated with statistical software SPSS 21.0.
The antibacterial study was done according to the methods reported
in the literature.53
