Water is an ideal solvent for chemical transformations in environmentally
friendly and sustainable processes. An operationally simple, metal-free,
and green approach to the synthesis of oxindole-fused spirotetrahydrofurans
from 3-allyl-3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles in water is described. This method
requires only cheap methanesulfonic acid as a catalyst and eliminates
the need of complicated reagents. This atom- and step-economical transformation
is highly efficient, which provides a new approach for the construction
of oxindole-fused spirotetrahydrofuran molecules with potential pharmaceutical
interest.

Introduction
Spirooxindoles have
become important synthetic targets due to their
promising biological activities in various therapeutic fields.1 As an important subtype of spirooxindoles, the
3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindole unit constitutes the core
structures of a variety of alkaloids and pharmaceuticals with pronounced
and diverse bioactivity profiles (Figure 1).2,3 Moreover, oxindoles
with a five-membered ring fused at the C-3 position are considered
as potential candidates for drug discovery among spirooxindoles and
thus have attracted significant attention from chemists.4 Several synthetic methodologies have been developed
for the construction of such skeletons.5−11 However, all of them were carried out in organic solvents rather
than in the lowest-cost and most common and clean resource, water. If water could
be served as a solvent for the synthesis of those spirooxindole derivatives,
it would be even more easy and ideal from the viewpoint of green chemistry.12 Moreover, the approaches involve intermolecular
processes, which often require excess substrates and/or relatively
expensive supporting ligands and face low selectivity and competitive
reaction issues compared with their intramolecular counterparts.13

spirooxindole scaffold.

For instance, in 2007, the Schreiber group investigated an
elegant
approach to synthesizing 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindoles
via Lewis acid-mediated annulations of isatins in CH2Cl2.5 Despite great innovation, this
synthesis required 3–5 steps and involved the use of macrobead-bound
crotylsilanes, which are not easy to synthesize. Later, Franz and
co-workers applied the Sc-catalyzed asymmetric [3 + 2] allylsilane
annulation reaction to the synthesis of 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl
spirooxindoles in CH2Cl2; this method involved
the presynthesis of the ScCl3(THF)3 complex
and required the assistance of several other reagents, such as NaSbF6 and TMSCl.6 Another representative
approach to synthesizing 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindoles
was the catalytic asymmetric 1,6-addition of 3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles
to linear 2,4-dienals in CH2Cl2, which was presented
by Melchiorre and co-workers in 2013.7 Although
this protocol also provides a straightforward access to the desired
spirooxindoles, it needs an additional step to access suitable 3-hydroxy-2-oxindole
precursors and four steps to form another synthetic precursor 2,4-dienals.
Besides the above representative methods, several similar synthetic
strategies giving access to 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindoles
have also been disclosed.8−10 However, issues still exist,
such as using toluene,8 tetrahydrofuran
(THF),9 or CHCl310 as the solvents and the requirement of complicated
reagents or catalysts, and the scope might be impaired by the unavailability
of particular substrates such as substituted allenoates,8 vinyl cyclopropanes,9 and ynones.10 Other groups also made
significant contributions for the synthesis of 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl
spirooxindoles.11 However, the chemistry
has been investigated with limited substrate scope.

Given the
importance of 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindoles
and our interest in the synthesis of oxindole derivatives,14 we sought to develop an easy and clean synthesis
of this interesting scaffold that addresses the above challenges.
Specifically, we hoped to identify conditions that would (1) enable
the use of water, which is cheap, readily available, and nontoxic, as
a solvent, (2) proceed with metal-free catalysts in an intramolecular
process, and (3) not require complicated and expensive reagents, leading
to an organic waste-minimized protocol. Herein, we report the results
of our investigation of the acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization
reaction of allylated oxindoles in water. This reaction is an environmentally
benign process, and no byproduct is produced in this process. To the
best of our knowledge, the given approach represents the first example
of using water as the solvent in an intramolecular manner for the
synthesis of 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindoles and provides
the clearest and most atom-economical processes as alternatives to
traditional intermolecular reactions.

Results and Discussion
We began our studies by choosing 3-prenyl-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole 1a as the model substrate, which can be easily prepared from
the reaction of isatin with prenylzinc according to the procedure
described previously by our group.14 The
results are presented in Table 1. First, benzenesulfonic acid (BSA) was tested as the reaction
catalyst. We found that the reaction proceeded very slowly to give
a low yield of desired product 2a (entry 1). However,
allylated oxindole 1a was found to cyclize much faster
when catalyzed by p-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TsOH) in refluxing THF to afford product 2a in 55% yield (entry 2). In contrast to the previously reported intermolecular
reaction for the preparation of 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindoles,
which required the addition of a variety of additives or metal-based
catalysts to reach high reactivity of the transformations, this intramolecular
hydroalkoxylation would be preferable in terms of simplicity and atom-economy.
However, this transformation required 30 h to proceed with full conversion
and resulted in the formation of dehydration product 3a. To improve the reaction efficiency, we continued our investigation
with other possible catalysts and solvents for cyclization reactions
(entries 3–5). The results showed that this cyclization of 1a can be accelerated dramatically in 1,4-dioxane when acid p-TsOH was replaced by methanesulfonic acid (MSA), which
gave products 2a in 68% yield after 8 h (entry 5). Water
offers practical advantages over organic solvents and has a similar
boiling point to that of 1,4-dioxane, which prompted us to explore
the possibility of using water as a solvent for the synthesis of 2a. Fortunately, we found that desired product 2a could be readily obtained in 80% yield in the presence of MSA in
water and dehydration product 3a was not observed (entry
6). A decrease in the catalyst loading to 10 mol % resulted in a slightly
lower product yield and slightly longer reaction time (entry 7). To
our great delight, when the reaction was conducted under an air atmosphere,
the result was the same as that under a nitrogen atmosphere (entry
8). To simplify the operation, we decided to perform our process under
an air atmosphere. Although other acids such as H2SO4 and TfOH were also effective for the intramolecular process,
none of them gave higher reaction efficiency than that of MSA (entries
9 and 10). Therefore, the optimized conditions for this cyclization
reaction are as follows: 20 mol % MSA as the catalyst and H2O as the solvent at reflux under air. It must be mentioned that dehydration
product 3a was not observed in all cases in which water
was used as the solvent.

With conditions
for this transformation established, we next investigated
the scope and limitations of this method with various 3-prenyl-3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles 1b–w (Table 2). The initial investigation of the reaction
was focused on varying the substituents on the phenyl ring of 2-oxindoles
with a free N–H group. We targeted these N-free substrates
because many oxindole-containing bioactive compounds do not carry
a protecting group at N-1.15 Therefore,
from the synthetic point of view, the use of N-unprotected oxindole
is preferred.16 Pleasingly, the reaction
worked well for N-unprotected 2-oxindoles 1b–i, in which the phenyl ring was functionalized with electron-donating
or -withdrawing groups at various positions. The outcome of the reaction
did not depend much on the nature of the substituents because no obvious
yield changes were exhibited for the generation of 2b–i (entries 1–8). For example, N-unprotected
oxindole substrates with a weak electron-donating methyl (1b) and a strong electron-donating methoxy (1c) group
at the C-5 position led to corresponding products 2b and 2c in 70 and 72% yields, respectively (entries 1 and 2). Halogens
on the phenyl ring of oxindoles 1d–i were also compatible in this reaction, with corresponding products 2d–i obtained in 70–76% yields
(entries 3–8). However, the reaction time varied with the introduction
of halogens at different positions of the phenyl ring of the oxindole
core. For example, the 4- and 5-Br-substituted oxindoles (1f and 1g) gave cyclized products 2f and 2g in 6 h (entries 5 and 6), whereas the 6- and 7-Br-substituted
oxindoles (1h and 1i) required 8 and 12
h to reach complete conversion of the starting material into desired
products 2h and 2i, respectively (entries
7 and 8). The results indicated that the presence of a substituent
on the C-6 or C-7 position of oxindoles appears to show a slight deleterious
effect on reactivity. Additionally, the influence of various N-protecting
groups of oxindoles was investigated (entries 9–22). Small
substituents such as methyl groups on the N-atom of oxindoles (1j–p) reacted well to afford desired products 2j–p in 6–12 h (entries 9–15).
Other groups, such as ethyl, allyl, or benzyl groups, in place of
methyl groups on the N-atom were also tolerated (entries 16–22).
However, these substrates took a longer reaction time for completion
of the reaction. For example, when the N-methyl group (1j, entry 9) was changed into an ethyl group (1q, entry
16), the reaction time increased to 40 h. A similar tendency was observed
when the N-methyl protecting group at the oxindole framework was replaced
by an N-allyl group (1j vs 1t, 1k vs 1u, 1o vs 1v). In the
reaction with N-benzyl-substituted substrate 1w, full
conversion was observed after 70 h (entry 22). Nevertheless, corresponding
products 2q–w could still be obtained
in good yields. The best explanation of the increasing reaction time
with the increasing hydrophobicity of alkyl substituents might be
that stronger hydrophobicity reduced the solubility of oxindoles in
water, thereby requiring a longer time for completion. All of the
products were identified via NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS). The structure of product 2o was further determined
by single-crystal X-ray analysis (see the Supporting Information).

yield.

To assess the efficiency
and potential for applications of this
method, a gram-scale synthesis of spirocylic oxindole 2a was performed under the standard conditions (Scheme 1). Pleasingly, the reaction could be scaled
easily to 5 mmol and likely even larger without significantly compromising
the yield. Specifically, when 1.13 g of 1a was utilized,
0.79 g of product 2a was obtained in 70% yield (small
scale 82%, entry 8 in Table 1).

Scheme 1 Scaled-Up Synthesis
Mechanistically, we envisioned that these intramolecular
reactions
might occur through acid-catalyzed electrophilic addition (Scheme 2). Initially, MSA
was used as the catalyst and a proton is added to the less substituted
terminal alkene carbon so as to form carbocation I. The
formation of the Markovnikov intermediate is favored because carbocation I is significantly stabilized by its three alkyl substituents.
Then, the positively charged part of I combines with
the oxygen atom in the hydroxy group that is electron-rich to form
intermediate II. Finally, cyclized product 2 is formed from intermediate II via deprotonation.

Scheme 2 Proposed Reaction Mechanism
A reviewer suggested to test this hypothesis by performing the model reaction in the absence
of an acidic catalyst. Thus, a control experiment was carried out
by refluxing 1a in the absence of MSA. Under the standard
conditions, the reaction of 1a in water in the absence
of MSA for 6 h did not lead to any cyclized product 2a and 1a was recovered in almost quantitative yield,
suggesting that the proposed mechanism is applicable to explain the
observations in the present study.

Because of the success described
above, other 3-allyl-3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles,
such as 3′-ethyl-3′-phenyl-substituted allyl compound 4, were also investigated (Scheme 3). To our delight, these types of compounds
were also competent substrates in this reaction. With a slight change
in the conditions (using a small amount of dioxane as a co-solvent),
the corresponding 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindole 5 was obtained in synthetically useful yield by simply treating
compound 4 with MSA.

Scheme 3 Reaction Using Other 3-Allyl-3-hydroxy-2-oxindoles
Finally, we are pleased to
report our achievement involving the
use of acenaphthylenone instead of oxindole in this reaction to produce
related spiro-product 7 (Scheme 4). Tetrahydrofuran spirooxindole derivatives
possess attractive biological activities.2,3,5 We believe that the development of an efficient
approach to synthesizing their analogues would be useful for structure–activity
relationship studies. As expected, spiro-product 7 was
obtained with excellent yield when substrate 6 was subjected
to the same reaction albeit a longer reaction time was required compared
to that for oxindole substrates 1.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
developed a simple and sustainable MSA-catalyzed
method for synthesizing 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindole
derivatives from 3-allyl-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole derivatives. In this
synthesis process, water was used as the solvent and the reaction
was carried out under open air. Furthermore, this method requires
the addition of only one reagent, whereas previous methods for synthesizing
3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindole generally require the addition
of two or more reagents. Therefore, the approach is not only green
and economic but also facile and easy to scale up. As such, this environmentally
friendly method to synthesizing 3,2′-tetrahydrofuryl spirooxindole
derivatives holds promising potential for future applications in both
academic and industrial research.

General
Methods
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 400 and 100 MHz in CDCl3 with chemical
shift (δ) given in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard. Multiplicities were indicated: s (singlet),
d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), dd (doublet
of doublets), etc; coupling constants (J) were given
in hertz (Hz). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded using
electrospray ionization (ESI) and time-of-flight mass analysis.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Spiro-Compounds
To
a solution of allylated alcohols (0.5 mmol) in 10 mL of H2O was added MSA (0.1 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated
to reflux until thin-layer chromatography monitoring showed complete
consumption of the substrate. After refluxing, the mixture was cooled
to room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 5.0
mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried with
MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified
by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 5:1)
to afford the corresponding spiro-products.
