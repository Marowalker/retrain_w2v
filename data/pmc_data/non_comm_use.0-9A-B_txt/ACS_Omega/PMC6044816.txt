This
study represents the first example of protein hydrolysis at
pH = 7.4 and 60 °C by a metal-substituted polyoxometalate (POM)
in the presence of a zwitterionic surfactant. Edman degradation results
show that in the presence of 0.5% w/v 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate
(CHAPS) detergent, a Zr(IV)-substituted Wells–Dawson-type POM,
K15H[Zr(α2-P2W17O61)2]·25H2O (Zr1-WD2), selectively
hydrolyzes human serum albumin exclusively at peptide bonds involving
Asp or Glu residues, which contain carboxyl groups in their side chains.
The selectivity and extent of protein cleavage are tuned by the CHAPS
surfactant by an unfolding mechanism that provides POM access to the
hydrolyzed peptide bonds.

Introduction
On the basis of complete
sequencing of several genomes, 30% of
all proteins are estimated to be hydrophobic membrane proteins.1,2 The study of the structure and function of this large class of proteins
is essential as they are among the prime drug targets. In fact, 60%
of the current drug targets are located on the cell surface.3 The large size, structural complexity, and intrinsic
hydrophobicity of these biomolecules often complicate their structural
investigations by the existing experimental methods. Therefore, controlled
fragmentation of membrane proteins into smaller fragments remains
a key approach to facilitate their structural analysis.4 However, this requires the hydrolysis of the
peptide bond, which has an estimated half-life of between 350 and
600 years under physiological conditions.5−7 In addition,
as a result of their hydrophobic nature, membrane proteins are insoluble
in aqueous solutions, and denaturation is often encountered. Therefore,
the addition of surfactants is often essential to mimic a hydrophobic
environment and stimulate solubilization of membrane proteins. Generally,
the concentration of the surfactant should be maintained above the
critical micelle concentration (CMC),8 and
therefore, relatively high surfactant concentrations (usually in the
range of 0.5–1.0% w/v) are required.9

Proteolytic enzymes are often used to hydrolyze peptide bonds
in
proteins for many purposes in biochemistry, biotechnology, and proteomics.
However, they are very sensitive to the experimental conditions and
often undergo denaturation in the presence of surfactants, which results
in the loss of catalytic activity. Therefore, they are not suitable
for the hydrolysis of hydrophobic and membrane proteins. Consequently,
there is an urgent need for new synthetic proteases that are compatible
with surfactants and can eventually be used to hydrolyze membrane
proteins in an efficient and selective manner under mild reaction
conditions.

Several metal complexes have been shown to induce
hydrolysis of
peptide bonds in proteins;10−16 however, their catalytic ability under the conditions pertinent
to membrane proteins has been largely unexplored. PdII and
PtII complexes have been studied for the selective hydrolysis
of proteins in solutions containing surfactants;9,16 however,
very low pH conditions (2.5–2.9) were required to observe the
reactivity, which is disadvantageous as this often leads to pronounced
background cleavage and also results in denaturation of the protein
under study. More recently, a Ni(II)-containing complex has been shown
to cleave a terminal affinity tag from a recombinant fusion protein,
thus providing an interesting alternative for currently used techniques.17

Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of
inorganic metal–oxygen
clusters with a range of tunable properties.18−20 POMs are commercially
used as catalysts in a wide range of chemical reactions.21−24 Moreover, the biological activity of POMs has been reported with
respect to their antiviral, antibacterial, and anticancer properties.25−28 We have recently demonstrated that POMs exhibit reactivity toward
a range of biologically relevant molecules and their model systems.29−34 Recently, the ability of metal-substituted POMs to act as a novel
class of artificial peptidases has been introduced by our group. Zr(IV)-substituted
POMs have been proven to selectively cleave proteins, ranging from
a small, flexible polypeptide system, such as oxidized insulin chain
B,35 to larger protein systems with a defined
tertiary structure and surface charge, such as hen egg white lysozyme
(HEWL),36 human serum albumin (HSA),37,38 myoglobin,39 and cytochrome c.40 The hydrolytic experiments were performed in
aqueous solutions under physiological pH conditions; however, to develop
Zr(IV)-substituted POMs as artificial proteases for hydrophobic proteins,
their activity as catalysts in the presence of surfactants needs to
be established. We recently demonstrated that in the presence of anionic,
neutral, and zwitterionic surfactants, the Zr(IV)-substituted Wells–Dawson
POM, K15H[Zr(α2-P2W17O61)2] (1), preserves its catalytic
activity toward hydrolysis of the peptide bond in dipeptides.41 Diffusion Ordered NMR Spectroscopy (DOSY) has
shown that anionic and neutral surfactants do not exhibit any interaction
with 1, whereas a tertiary system is formed between the
dipeptide, POM, and the surfactant in the presence of zwitterionic
surfactants such as 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate
(CHAPS). The interaction between 1 and CHAPS occurs through
the positively charged ammonium group, whereas, at the same time,
the negative charge of the sulfonate group attenuates this electrostatic
interaction. Thereby, precipitation that typically occurs in the presence
of positively charged surfactants is prevented.41,42 However, the applicability of Zr(IV)-substituted POMs toward protein
hydrolysis in surfactant solutions is challenging because interactions
between the POM and the surfactant may shield POM binding to the protein,
which is largely electrostatic in nature. Moreover, the partial unfolding
of the protein caused by surfactants may affect the selectivity of
protein hydrolysis by altering POM/protein interactions, which are
proposed to occur according to the lock and key principle.25,43 Therefore, in this study, we explore the compatibility of 1 to act as a metalloprotease for the hydrolysis of HSA in
the presence of the zwitterionic surfactant, CHAPS (see Figure 1), which is widely used for
solubilizing membrane proteins.44,45 HSA consists of 585
amino acids and serves as an excellent model for studying the hydrolytic
activity of Zr-POMs in surfactant solutions. The protein has been
structurally well characterized, and its hydrolysis by the Zr-POMs
has been studied in detail. This offers the possibility to elucidate
the role of the detergents in the activity and selectivity of the
catalyst.

Results and Discussion
In the hydrolysis experiments, HSA (0.02 mM) was incubated with 1 in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) at 60 °C in the
presence of different concentrations of CHAPS (0.0–2.0% w/v).
To monitor the progress of the reaction, aliquots of the homogeneous
reaction mixture were first taken at different time intervals. Then,
the polypeptide fragments that were formed as a result of protein
hydrolysis were separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of multiple bands
on SDS-PAGE (see Figure 2) clearly indicate that 1 is able to hydrolyze HSA in
the presence of up to 2.0% w/v CHAPS, which is well above its CMC
(0.5% w/v) and above the range of surfactant concentrations that are
typically used for solubilization of membrane proteins (0.5–1.0%
w/v).9 Interestingly, an increase in CHAPS
concentration led to a gradual decrease in the number and intensity
of the bands in SDS-PAGE. Longer incubation times resulted in more
intense bands, which is consistent with the increasing yields of protein
fragmentation (see Figure S1). Our previous
studies have shown that no hydrolysis of HSA was observed in the absence
of the Zr-POMs.37,38 In the presence of the lacunary
Wells–Dawson K10[α2-P2W17O61]·20H2O POM, no hydrolysis
was observed either, indicating that the presence of Zr(IV) is essential
for the hydrolytic activity. Moreover, when the ZrCl4 salt
was used, limited hydrolysis yields and the formation of insoluble
Zr(IV) gels were observed, emphasizing the need of the POM as a Zr(IV)-stabilizing
and protein-recognizing ligand.

Edman degradation of polypeptide
fragments observed in SDS-PAGE
unambiguously confirmed that, in the presence of 0.5% CHAPS, HSA was
hydrolyzed by 1 at seven distinct sites: Cys62–Asp63,
Gly71–Asp72, Asp107–Asp108, Lys313–Asp314, His367–Glu368,
Ser470–Asp471, and Ala511–Asp512 visible on the gel
(see Figures S2 and S3 and Table S1). Remarkably, all of the hydrolyzed
peptide bonds in HSA were upstream from either the Asp or the Glu
amino acid, both of which contain a carboxyl group in their side chains.
This is in full accordance with our previous findings, which showed
that, in the absence of surfactants, proteins were mainly hydrolyzed
next to Asp or Glu residues that were located in the positive patches
of proteins. The high selectivity of Zr(IV) toward hydrolyzing peptide
bonds that involve Asp and Glu residues can be rationalized by two
explanations: (i) the anchoring of the carboxyl group side chain to
Zr(IV), or (ii) by the ability of the deprotonated carboxyl group
to accept a proton from the coordinated water molecule, making it
a more effective nucleophile.46 Interestingly,
CHAPS plays a significant role in tuning the reactivity and selectivity
of 1 toward HSA hydrolysis. In the absence of CHAPS,
the cleavage was observed at four peptide bonds (Arg114–Leu115,
Ala257–Asp258, Lys313–Asp314, Cys302–Glu303),
whereas seven cleavage sites were observed in the presence of CHAPS.
Interestingly, all cleaved peptide bonds are located in the vicinity
of a positively charged surface patch that can electrostatically interact
with the negatively charged POM surface (Figure 3). With the exception of the hydrolysis site,
Lys313–Asp314, which is observed both in the absence of CHAPS
and in the presence of 0.5% CHAPS, the surfactant is clearly responsible
for altering the selectivity and generating an increase in the number
of cleavage sites. Surfactants are known to break noncovalent interactions
in proteins,47 and it is likely that this
results in the opening of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of
HSA, making the potential X–Asp cleavage sites more accessible
for hydrolysis.

charged
surface areas are shown in red, and positively charged surface areas
are shown in blue. Asp residues in Asp–X bonds that are hydrolyzed
are shown in yellow. The image was created using PyMol molecular visualization
system software.

Circular dichroism (CD)
measurements shown in Figure 4 show a clear indication that
CHAPS interacts with HSA in such a way that the α-helical content
of HSA gradually lowers from 1.0% CHAPS onward, indicating a partial
unfolding of the protein. In addition, Figure S5 shows that, under a constant CHAPS concentration and increasing
concentrations of 1, a slight decrease in α-helix
takes place, indicating that interactions between 1 and
HSA take place in the surfactant solution.

μM) in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4,

It has been known that 1 undergoes equilibria in solution
and that different species can be present depending on the experimental
conditions, such as concentration, pH, temperature, or incubation
time. The monomeric 1:1 species, which is presumed to be the catalytically
active species, is a very elusive species due to the fast equilibria
between the different POMs (see Figure 1). However, we were recently able to isolate a noncovalent
complex formed between the structurally analogous Zr-Keggin POM and
HEWL. The single crystal X-ray structure of the complex showed that
the monomeric Zr-Keggin POM was exclusively present in the co-crystal
with the protein, giving the first full structural evidence for the
existence of the catalytically active form.48 Furthermore, the structural model showed that the POM initially
binds to positively charged patches on the surface of the protein.
The interaction types vary from water-mediated hydrogen bonds to direct
electrostatic interactions, but overall, the interaction seems to
be directed by the electrostatic attraction between the negatively
charged POM ligand and the positively charged amino acid side chains.48

To study the influence of increasing CHAPS
concentrations on solution
speciation of the POMs, 31P NMR spectroscopy was further
applied (see Figure S6). In the absence
of CHAPS, 1 is present as the dimeric species (Zr1-WD2),
whereas upon an increase in % CHAPS, a gradual conversion takes place,
in which 1 partially transforms into α2-P2W17. As α2-P2W17 is hydrolytically inactive, this conversion could
explain the gradual decrease in reactivity observed upon an increase
in % CHAPS. In addition, 31P NMR measurements were taken
to understand the interaction behavior between 1 and
HSA in the presence of 0.5% CHAPS (see Figure S7). The dimeric species of 1 (Zr1-WD2) is predominantly
present in solution in the absence of HSA. However, upon increasing
concentrations of HSA, a gradual disappearance of the signal corresponding
to 1 is observed. This clearly demonstrates that in the
presence of 0.5% CHAPS, 1 interacts with HSA to form
a POM/HSA complex with a longer correlation time and consequently
a faster T2 relaxation.49

Tryptophan
(Trp) fluorescence quenching is a powerful tool to study
binding of different molecules to a protein, and it was further used
to study the interaction between 1 and HSA in the presence
of CHAPS. HSA contains only one Trp residue at position Trp-214, and
the overall protein emission is dominated by this residue, which absorbs
at the longest wavelength and displays the largest extinction coefficient.
Energy absorbed by phenylalanine (Phe) and Tyr residues is often efficiently
transferred to the Trp residues in the same protein.50 In a first step, the effect of the CHAPS on the Trp fluorescence
of HSA was investigated (see Figure S8).
In these steady-state fluorescence experiments, the concentration
of HSA was kept constant, whereas the concentration of CHAPS was increased
from 0 to 5% w/v. Interestingly, it was found that the emission wavelength
at the maximum intensity decreased from 342 to 328 nm as a result
of the added CHAPS. The more hydrophobic environment, which is created
by the addition of CHAPS, results in the shift in the emission maximum
to lower wavelengths.50

Subsequently,
the effect of the presence of 0.5% w/v CHAPS on the
quenching of the Trp fluorescence of HSA by 1 was examined
(see Figure 5). The
concentrations of HSA and CHAPS were kept constant, whereas the concentration
of 1 was increased stepwise.51 Effective quenching of Trp fluorescence by 1 was observed
in the presence of CHAPS, indicating that the presence of the surfactant
does not hinder POM/protein interactions. Analysis of the data by
the Tachiya model (see Experimental Section and Figure S10) revealed that quenching
of Trp fluorescence was a result of the binding of multiple Zr1-WD2
molecules to HSA.52 Although the value
of the quenching constant (Kq) of Trp
by 1 in the presence of the surfactant is slightly lower
(3.0 × 105 M–1) than the Kq in the absence of the surfactant (5.1 ×
105 M–1), the model revealed that more
POM was bound per HSA unit when the surfactant was present (Table S2). This is in accordance with the more
“open” 3D structure of the protein caused by the surfactant,
making the interaction sites more accessible for POM binding.

concentrations of Zr1-WD2 ([HSA] = 10–5 M, [CHAPS]
= 0.5 wt %, pH = 7.4). From top to bottom, the concentration of Zr1-WD2
was increased stepwise from 0 to 10–5 M with increments
of 10–6 M.

Conclusions
In conclusion, in this study, we have demonstrated
that a metal-substituted
POM, K15H[Zr(α2-P2W17O61)2] (1), selectively hydrolyzes
a relatively large protein, HSA, in the presence of a zwitterionic
surfactant, CHAPS, under physiological pH conditions. The POM catalyst
preserves its hydrolytic activity in the presence of surfactant concentrations
well above those that are typically used for solubilizing hydrophobic
proteins. Most importantly, in the presence of the surfactant, 1 acts as a site-selective agent, hydrolyzing HSA exclusively
at peptide bonds containing amino acid residues that contain carboxyl
groups in their side chain. The hydrolyzed Asp and Glu peptide bonds
are either located in the positive patches of the protein or contain
positively charged amino acids such as Lys and His, which aid electrostatic
interaction with the negatively charged POM surface. Interestingly,
this study revealed that by partially unfolding the 3D structure of
proteins, surfactants can be used as a means to tune the selectivity
of hydrolysis by making the potential cleavage sites more accessible
to the POM catalyst. We are currently investigating the hydrolysis
of water-insoluble proteins in surfactant solutions. These findings
may be an important step forward in developing Zr-substituted POMs
as a potential class of metalloproteases for the hydrolysis of hydrophobic
and membrane proteins.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
α-/β-K6P2W18O62·14/19H2O,53 α2-K10P2W17O61·20H2O,53 and K15H[Zr-(α2-P2W17O61)2]·25H2O54 were prepared according to
published procedures.
HSA was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich in the highest available
purity (≥99%) and was used without further purification.

Hydrolysis Study
Solutions containing HSA (0.02 mM)
and K15H[Zr-(α2-P2W17O61)2]·25H2O (1 mM) with different
% w/v of CHAPS (0–10% w/v) were prepared in phosphate buffer
(10 mM, pH 7.4). Samples were incubated at 60 °C, and aliquots
were taken at different time increments and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Electrophoresis
SDS-PAGE was performed on a 16% (w/v)
polyacrylamide resolving gel (Tris–HCl buffer, 1.5 M, pH 8.8)
and a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel (Tris–HCl, 0.5 M,
pH 6.8). Each sample (15 μL) was mixed with the sample buffer
(5 μL) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. A total of 10 μL
of the resulting solution was loaded onto the gel. A PageRuler prestained
protein ladder (10–170 kDa) was used as a molecular mass standard.
An OmniPAGE electrophoretic cell was used with an EV243 power supply
(both produced by Consort). Two SDS-PAGE gels were run at the same
time in a Tris–Glycine-SDS running buffer with the maximum
voltage set to 200 V, a constant current set to 70 mA, and the maximum
power set to 50 W. The total running time was approximately 1.5 h.
SDS-PAGE gels were visualized with silver staining, and an image of
each gel was taken using a GelDoc EZ Imager (BioRad).

Edman Degradation
SDS-PAGE gels were blotted onto a
PVDF membrane (using a BioRad Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Transfer Kit) and
stained with Coomassie blue. Coomassie-stained protein bands were
cut from the membrane, destained in methanol, and washed with ultrapure
water to remove any remaining salts before Edman degradation on a
capillary Procise 491cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems).55

31P NMR Spectroscopy
To study the stability
of the Zr-POM with increasing % of the surfactant, solutions containing
K15H[Zr-(α2-P2W17O61)2]·25H2O (1 mM) and increasing
% w/v of CHAPS (0–2%) in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4, 10%
D2O) were prepared. To study the effect of increasing concentrations
of HSA on the stability of Zr-POM in the presence of a specific w/v
% of the surfactant, solutions containing K15H[Zr-(α2-P2W17O61)2]·25H2O (2 mM) and HSA (0, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.5 mM) in a certain w/v
% of the surfactant (0.5% CHAPS) in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4)
were also prepared. 31P NMR spectra of the different samples
were recorded after mixing and after incubation at 60 °C at different
time increments by using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer. As
an external standard, 25% H3PO4 in D2O in a sealed capillary was used.

CD Spectroscopy
To study the effect of increasing %
of the surfactant on the secondary structure of HSA, solutions containing
HSA (5 μM) and increasing % w/v of CHAPS (0–5%) in phosphate
buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) were prepared. To study the effect of increasing
concentrations of Zr-POM on the secondary structure of HSA in the
presence of a specific % surfactant, solutions containing HSA (5 uM)
and K15H[Zr-(α2-P2W17O61)2]·25H2O (0–25 μM)
in a certain % surfactant (0.5% CHAPS) in phosphate buffer (10 mM,
pH 7.4) were also prepared. CD measurements were performed at RT using
a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter, and each sample was separately
measured in a quartz cell with an optical path length of 1 mm. Scans
were recorded in the far-UV wavelength region (λ = 200–260
nm), where peptide bond absorption takes place. For each CD measurement,
a baseline correction was performed by subtracting the spectrum of
the respective buffer solution with its specific % surfactant from
the spectrum of the protein.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Steady-state
fluorescence
experiments were recorded on a Photon Technology Quanta Master QM-6/2005
spectrofluorimeter. Quartz cuvettes with a 10.0 mm optical path length
were used. Spectra were recorded in a buffered 10 μM protein
concentration solution (phosphate buffer, pH = 7.4) at room temperature
monitoring the emission from 305 to 400 or 420 nm, with a maximum
at approximately 330 nm. Excitation of the sample took place at 295
nm to avoid excitation of tyrosine residues. The emission and excitation
slit widths were opened at 0.37 mm (resolution of 1.0 nm). The following
concentrations of the used surfactants in the absence of POM were
measured: 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0% w/v. The Zr1-WD2 POM concentration
was increased stepwise from 0 to 10 μM with increments of 1.0
μM and in the presence of 0.5% w/v of surfactant. The analysis
of the results for the Zr1-WD2 POM in the presence of SDS was carried
out with the help of a derived Stern-Volmer equation56 1  where F0 is the
unquenched fluorescence intensity, F the fluorescence
in the presence of the quencher, and [Q] the concentration of the
quencher.

The fluorescence data of the Zr1-WD2 POM in the presence
of CHAPS were analyzed using a different equation because we expect
the number of bound molecules to be higher than 1. For this reason,
the Tachiya model,52eq 2, is used 2  where F0 is the
unquenched fluorescence intensity, F the fluorescence
in the presence of the quencher, [Q] the concentration of the quencher,
[M] the concentration of the protein, and m the number
of binding sites.
