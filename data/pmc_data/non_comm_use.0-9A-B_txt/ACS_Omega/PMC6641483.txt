We
report here the growth and functional properties of silicon-based
nanowhisker (NW) diodes produced by the vapor–liquid–solid
process using a pulsed laser deposition technique. For the first time,
we demonstrate that this method could be employed to control the size
and shape of silicon NWs by using a two-component catalyst material
(Au/Cu ≈ 60:1). During the NW growth, copper is distributed
on the outer surface of the NW, whereas gold sticks as a droplet to
its top. The length of NWs is defined by the total amount of copper
in the catalyst alloy droplet. The measurements of the electrical
transport properties revealed that in contact with the substrate,
individual NWs demonstrate typical I–V diode characteristics. Our approach can become an important
new tool in the design of novel electronic components.

==== Body
Introduction
Quasi-one-dimensional
and two-dimensional objects are the basis
for most of the modern microelectronic and nanoelectronic devices.1−3 As such, silicon nanowires or nanowhiskers (NWs) are unique one-dimensional
nanostructures with a high aspect ratio, which makes them crucially
important for various applications including semiconductor logics,
memory, solar energy cells, sensors, and nanoelectromechanic devices.4−9 NW production requires a reliable control of multiple parameters,
such as the diameter, height, crystal orientation, concentration of
doping impurities, and so forth.

One of the established methods
for the NW growth is the vapor–liquid–solid
(VLS) technique. A metal catalyst deposited on a single crystal silicon
substrate forms a eutectic liquid alloy droplet, which creates an
area with minimal energy on the surface. Placed in a NW-forming environment,10 these droplets absorb both the material from
the substance-reach atmosphere and the drifting atoms from the surface.
Once the metal–silicon alloy gets to the saturated state, the
silicon atoms begin to diffuse through and crystallize underneath
the droplets, forming the NWs.11 The NW
body is formed by pure silicon with traces of the catalyst material.
The VLS technique also allows a precise doping of NWs during the growth
(including catalyst doping11,12). Gold is one of the
most common catalyst materials applied in this process. It can also
be used as a basis for a double-component alloy.13 In particular, the Au/Cu alloy was applied to fabricate
germanium14 or IV–V semiconductor15 NWs. The unique features of the VLS process
enable us to control the NW structure and functionality by changing
such parameters as the substrate temperature,16 the amount of growth substance in the reaction chamber atmosphere,17 and so forth. This approach employs the growth
of self-organized structures, where each NW might act as a separate
electronic component. This results in a dramatic decrease of the size
of the produced devices and significant simplification of the fabrication
process. Silicon NWs can be produced via the VLS technique by chemical
vapor deposition,18,19 electron-beam evaporation,20 molecular beam epitaxy,21 magnetron sputtering,22 and pulsed laser
deposition23,24 (PLD). Among these technologies,
PLD is the most flexible one in terms of plasma energy range (10–100
eV) and growth speeds. Also, PLD provides a unique opportunity of
precise multielement codeposition with low dopant atomic concentrations
(<1%).

A successful application of semiconducting NWs as
a universal electronic
component requires a precise control of the NW doping type and structure.25 As an effective tool for manipulating functional
properties, doping could have various side effects on the NW surface
geometry, leading to an unstable growth, nonsymmetric side expansion,
formation of a jagged surface,26,27 and so forth. The key
feature of our work is the use of the two-component Au/Cu alloy catalyst
for PLD growth of silicon NWs, with gold as the main catalytic metal
and copper as the doping element, where Cu is used to control the
geometrical form without contaminating the NW structure. This opens
a new way to the controlled growth of the NWs, giving new insights
into precise doping of Si NWs and showing that the alloy catalyst
has a great potential in controlling the shape of PLD-produced NWs.

Results
and Discussion
In this study, the growth of NWs was performed
by PLD in two steps
according to the VLS technique: the formation of metal catalyst clusters
on the substrate (n-type monocrystalline silicon (111)) was followed
by the catalyst-assisted growth of the NWs at p-type silicon target
sputtering. The catalyst droplets were seeded by simultaneous codeposition
of gold and copper, at the 60:1 ratio (see the Supporting Information).

The diameter of NWs is proportional
to the size of the initial
Au/Cu catalyst cluster. The latter depends directly on the substrate
temperature, which is normally set in the range of 500–600
°C. Atomic force microscopy images of metal clusters formed at
different temperatures are shown in Figure 1a,b,d. Single cluster profiles (Figure 1c) clearly demonstrate
the way to control the cluster size: higher temperatures lead to the
formation of bigger volume droplets separated by larger gaps between
them.

Figure 1 Atomic force micrographs of Si(111) substrates (6.5 × 6.5
μm) after the deposition of catalyst clusters at T = 500 (a), 550 (b), and 600 °C (d); panel (c) shows the typical
profiles of metal clusters for different deposition temperatures.

The catalyst cluster arrangement
selected in our work for the next
growth step corresponds to the substrate temperature of 600 °C.
As shown on the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) in Figure 2a,b, NWs grow in different
sizes and shapes depending on the type of the catalyst droplet. For
the pure Au catalyst, the growth resulted in short conically shaped
NWs (50–800 nm in height) oriented along the normal to the
Si(111) substrate surface, with the same cone-base diameter as the
initial droplet size. Meanwhile, with the Au/Cu catalyst, the NWs
developed into elongated pillars with clearly shaped facets growing
in {011} directions and topped with a spherical metal cap (Figure 2b). Part of the VLS
mechanism connected with atom inflow from the substrate surface is
demonstrated in Figure 2c–e. The image obtained by secondary electrons (Figure 2c,e) shows the geometrical
outline of the surface with step-morphology terraces created by the
Au/Cu catalyst droplet migration, similarly to the works.28,29 The elemental contrast revealed by backscattered electrons in Figure 2d displays a sharp
boundary between the Si NW body and the Au/Cu droplet. The row of
silicon droplets on the side surface is left by the flow of the silicon
adatoms from the substrate to the solid–liquid interface at
the top (Figure 2e).

(in yellow). SEM of single NW growth in the ⟨111⟩ direction
in secondary (c,e) and backscattered (d) electron modes. The row of
silicon clusters on the facets (e) marks the Si atom upflow from the
substrate.

The in-plane growth of NWs (formed
under ultrahigh vacuum conditions
and at the base pressure of about P ≈ 10–8 Torr) could be explained by the influence of the
hydrogen passivating layer produced after the hydrofluoric acid substrate
treatment30 (Figure 3a,b). The in-plane NWs could be used as building
blocks for nanooptical and nanoelectronical devices,31 as well as for stretchable electronics.32 The planar growth mode could be easily transformed into
vertical one by a proper choice of laser plasma energies.

Figure 3 SEM micrographs:
(a,b)—NW growth along the ⟨011⟩
direction and (c,d)—NW growth along the ⟨111⟩
direction. The droplets are pseudocolored (in yellow).

The energy of the silicon particles in the plasma
was decreased
by elevating the deposition chamber pressure to 5 mTorr with the introduction
of pure argon (99.999% purity). The produced NWs were aligned vertically
(Figure 3c,d) with
the average distance of ∼1.5–2.0 μm and the NW
diameter in the range of 100–280 nm. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) data confirm that silicon NWs have a single crystalline
structure with a very high degree of lattice perfection growing parallel
to the ⟨111⟩ direction (Figure 4c–e). Inside the NWs, TEM also revealed
defects common for cubic structures. For example, one observes coherent
twin boundary, 60° around the ⟨111⟩ direction (Figure 4e) close to the Si/Au
interface. Although the TEM data allow us to estimate the metal cluster
(002) interplanar distance inside the NWs (Figure 4d): d002 ≈
2A, which might correspond either to AuCu (d002 = 1.93A) or to Au (d002 = 2.04A).

corresponding maps of the elemental distribution for O, Al, Si, Cu,
and Au. Note that Cu and Au are mostly concentrated in the top metal
droplet. Part of the Cu atoms are evenly distributed over the side
facets.

The nanostructure and distribution
of different chemical elements
in an NW was controlled by high-angle annular dark-field scanning
TEM (HAADF-STEM) with elemental mapping via energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy. It shows the presence of Au and Cu in the top droplet
as well as on the side facets of Si NWs (Figure 4j,k). Remarkably, gold and copper do not
mix and display a different surface distribution. A small fraction
of the Au metal that escapes the cap forms gold nanoclusters sparsely
distributed on the side walls of the NWs. A similar segregation of
Au clusters on the sidewall of faceted Si nanowires was previously
reported.28 Copper also outflows the catalyst
droplet, but in a much more intensive way, forming a cluster network
on the facets (see Figure 4a,b for comparison). This could be connected to the well-known
high mobility of Cu and to its ability to form epitaxial films on
silicon {011} surfaces.33 It is important
to mention that the metal clusters on the surface are sparsely distributed
but still lead to a weak leakage current.

Volt–ampere
characteristics (I–V curves)
of the fabricated NWs were measured by the two-probe
method. The SEM image of an individual NW brought into the mechanical
contact with the tungsten probe is shown in Figure 5c. The electron-beam-induced current (EBIC)
image in Figure 5d
was obtained at a negative external bias field, and higher brightness
corresponds to a higher current and concentration of carriers. Thus,
p-type silicon NWs grown on a n-type substrate without any additional
impurity dopants exhibited an increased current at the NW-substrate
boundary, indicating that the most applied voltage occurs at the interface.
This fact evidences the existence of the p–n junction at the
interface and of p-type doping NW.

Figure 5 (a,b) Diode I–V curve
of the p-type NW on the n-type substrate and the equivalent circuit.
A weak leakage current flows through the metal clusters at the side
facets, which is taken into account as resistor R1 in the equivalent
circuit. (c) Microphotographs of the tungsten probe contact with the
individual NW in secondary electron mode. (d) EBIC image of the investigation
area shows the contrast meaning the electrical shorting of the circuit
through the NW.

The curves obtained by
the I–V measurements from
a single NW are characteristic for p–n
diodes (Figure 5a),
demonstrating a weak rectifying character in the correspondence with
the EBIC data. The curve is nearly linear at small values of applied
voltage in both current directions, indicating a presence of an Ohmic
shunt marked as R1 in the inset. The shunt defines the conductance
at all reverse biases when the p–n junction current is limited
by a high barrier, but it becomes less than the diode resistance at
sufficiently high forward bias voltages.

For a further enhancement
of electronic component reliability,
NW oxidation and current leakage along the side surface can be prevented
by applying a dielectric layer. For that, 8 nm of alumina was deposited
by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method34 onto the side facets of NWs without breaking the vacuum.35 Chemical elemental distribution maps (Figure 4g,h) revealed that
aluminum oxide had grown conformally onto the silicon surface, whereas
no continuous Al2O3 layer was formed on the
gold droplet. Such area-selective deposition is typical for the chemical
reactions used in ALD: a gold surface inhibits ALD growth as it lacks
hydroxyl groups.

Conclusions
We experimentally demonstrated
that silicon NW growth via a VLS
process can be effectively controlled by doping of a gold catalyst
with copper. The two metals play different roles in NW formation:
Au–Si eutectic facilitates the transfer of silicon atoms at
the growth interface, while Cu stabilizes the side facets and makes
it possible to control the formation of the NWs. The height of the
NWs depends on the silicon deposition rate and the number of NW nucleation
clusters.

The as-grown NWs demonstrate an I–V characteristic specific for p–n
junctions and can
be directly used as individual components in electronic circuits.
The layout of the NW configuration on a substrate can be directly
controlled by lithographic processing, and isolating coatings, as
demonstrated in the paper, can be fabricated by atomic layer deposition.
Thus, the growth technique described in the paper can be effectively
used for manufacturing modern nanoelectronic devices.
