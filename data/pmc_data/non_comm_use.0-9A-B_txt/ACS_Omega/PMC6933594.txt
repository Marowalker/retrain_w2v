Screening target microorganisms from a mutated recombinant
library
plays a crucial role in advancing synthetic biology and metabolic
engineering. However, conventional screening tools have several limitations
regarding throughput, cost, and labor. Here, we used the fluid array
platform to conduct high-throughput screening (HTS) that identified Escherichia coli ‘TesA thioesterase mutants
producing elevated yields of free fatty acids (FFAs) from a large
(106) mutant library. A growth-based screening method using
a TetA-RFP fusion sensing mechanism and a reporter-based screening
method using high-level FFA producing mutants were employed to identify
these mutants via HTS. The platform was able to cover >95% of the
mutation library, and it screened target cells from many arrays of
the fluid array platform so that a post-analysis could be conducted
by gas chromatography. The ‘TesA mutation of each isolated
mutant showing improved FFA production in E. coli was characterized, and its enhanced FFA production capability was
confirmed.

Introduction
Free fatty acids (FFAs) have attracted
a lot of attention because
of their potential as a controllable and renewable energy source.1,2 FFAs are also useful in the production of biofuels, cosmetics, lubricants/solvents,
and pharmaceutical drugs. The corn-based production of FFAs is problematic
because it competes with food production, increases refinery costs,
decreases land-use efficiency, and raises environmental concerns.
However, microbial-based FFA production shows potential in terms of
its economic cost, quick production time, and smaller space requirements.3−6 Because Escherichia coli is a commonly
used industrial organism, various approaches have been suggested that
may improve the microbial production of FFAs.

Over the last
decade, the overexpression of the rate-limiting enzyme
and deregulation of the degradation pathway have been implemented
to increase the microbial-based production capacity of FFAs and their
precursors, leading to 21.5 g/L of FFA with 0.5 g/L/h productivity.7−12 Microbial FFAs are mainly synthesized from acyl-ACP (acyl carrier
protein) by the enzyme thioesterase I (TesA).5 The enzymatic characteristics of TesA have been thoroughly characterized;
therefore, several previous studies have used it to increase the cellular
production of FFAs.13−16 However, Jiang and Cronan17 reported
that the overexpression of the enzymatic component in the fatty acid
synthesis (FAS) pathway does not guarantee maximum FFA production
in E. coli. Therefore, it is required
to ensure optimal activity from key enzymes and components in the
FAS pathway and subsequently improve production yields.

To find
an alternate FFA production method that relieves the dependence
on the excess expression level of ‘TesA, which requires signal
sequence-deficient E. coli acyl-CoA
thioesterase I, we previously found a ‘TesA mutant using a
conventional high-throughput screening (HTS) approach. We screened
a ‘TesA mutant library to identify mutants that produce more
FFAs than the wild-type (WT) enzyme.16 The
isolation of desired mutants from a large mutant library is typically
labor-intensive. Therefore, a two-step selection system was applied:
(1) FFA-dependent tetracycline resistance for the growth-based enrichment
of the desired mutants and then (2) selective isolation through FFA-dependent
RFP expression with FACS-Calibur. However, only a few samples from
the mutant library could be isolated during the growth-based enrichment
phase because of competitive growth in the antibiotic’s presence.
Still, the growth of mutants that possibly display suboptimal FFA
production can be affected by competitive crosstalk in the over-populated
condition.18 Therefore, this screening
method requires compartmentalization to avoid such crosstalk.

Several microfluidic approaches have been implemented to overcome
difficulties with compartmentalization and achieve complete coverage
of large mutant libraries. These methods have several benefits when
applied to HTS as an alternative to conventional experimental methods.19−22 Screening a library of more than 103 microbial mutants
has never been achieved using a microfluidic platform due to the trade-off
between the compartmentalized environment of HTS and the difficulties
associated with the selective isolation of desired mutants. We previously
described a fluid array platform that had been specifically designed
for the HTS of a large, microbial random mutation library.22 The simplicity of device fabrication and the
ease of identifying extraordinary samples mean that the fluid array
platform was successful in several different HTS applications that
involved the growth-based and reporter-based screening of a microbial
mutant library.23,24

This current study combines
the previously mentioned fluid array
screening approach and two-step screening (cell enrichment in tetracycline-containing
medium and RFP expression dependent on cellular FFA production). This
resulted in the isolation of ‘TesA mutants that display higher
FFA production than WT ‘TesA. We applied a hybrid screening
procedure that used both reporter-based and growth-based screening
simultaneously. In addition, we employed the fluid array platform
against the random mutant library in an isolated microenvironmental
culture condition to avoid the exclusion of suboptimal mutants. The
selected ‘TesA mutants were tested to confirm that cells expressing
mutants produced higher amounts of FFAs than cells expressing WT ‘TesA.

Experimental Methods
Materials and Reagents
The fluid array platform was
fabricated with two types of oil with different specific gravities
(SG) to compartmentalize the aqueous solutions: hydrocarbon oil (hexadecane,
SG = 0.76, Sigma-Aldrich, Korea) and fluorinated oil (FC-40, SG =
1.61, Sigma-Aldrich, Korea). Cells were cultured in Luria Bertani
broth (LB, Sigma-Aldrich, Korea) supplemented with antibiotics such
as ampicillin (Amp, 75 μg/mL), chloramphenicol (Cm, 50 μg/mL),
and tetracycline (Tet, 50 μg/mL) (all purchased from Bioshop
Canada Inc.). An LB agar plate (1% w/v Agar, Becton Dickinson) was
prepared for colony formation.

HTS with the fluid array used
M9 minimal medium (Minimal salt 5×, Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% (w/v) glucose, an appropriate antibiotic concentration,
and 0.3 mM of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) for the growth-based screening of the mutant library. Yeast
extract 1 g/L (w/v) and trace elements were also added. The trace
elements consisted of 2.4 g of FeCl3·6H2O, 0.3 g of CoCl2·6H2O, 0.15 g of CuCl2·2H2O, 0.3 g of ZnCl2, 0.3 g of
Na2MO4·2H2O, 0.075 g of H3BO3, and 0.495 g of MnCl2·4H2O per liter. The pH was maintained at 7.0 with 100 mM of sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).

According to the previous report22 and
product sheet of the fluorinated oil, the limit of solubility of fluorinated
oil toward distilled water is 0.02% (v/v) at theoretical maximum.
Therefore, to prevent the aqueous phase of the fluid array shrinking,
FC-40 oil was mixed with distilled water (0.1% v/v) using a rotary
shaker at 60 °C prior to the screening experiment. After the
overnight stirring, the distilled water was not thoroughly mixed with
the oils; thus, the final concentration of water in the oil was estimated
to be approximately 0.02% (v/v). The distilled water saturated with
fluorinated oil was used to prepare LB broth and M9 minimal medium
for microbial experiments in this study.

Preparation of the Bacterial Cells and GC Analysis of the FFAs
E. coli MG1655 was the parental
strain for all strains used in this research. The cell concentration
was determined by measuring the optical density at a wavelength of
600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer (Libra S22, Biochrom
Ltd, Cambridge, UK). For HTS, the ‘TesA mutant library and
fatty acid biosensor (FAB) cells harboring the biosensor plasmid pFAB
were prepared as described previously.16

GC analysis was conducted to analyze microbial FFA production
in a precise, quantitative manner. The selected cells were cultivated
in LB medium and diluted 1:100 in the previously described M9 minimal
medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose. When the OD600 reached around 1.0, IPTG was added to reach a final concentration
of 0.3 mM for the induction of ‘TesA expression. After 48 h
of incubation that resulted in microbial FFA production, 500 μL
of each culture was stored at −20 °C until analysis. Next,
50 μL of 6 N HCl, 500 μL of ethyl acetate, and 50 μL
of 1 g/L methyl nonadecanoate (Sigma-Aldrich) were added in sequence
as an internal standard. FFAs were extracted from the cultures by
vortexing for 30 s and centrifuging for 2 min. An additional 500 μL
of ethyl acetate was added, and the same extraction procedure was
repeated. Extracted FFAs were methylated by adding 100 μL of
MeOH: 6 N HCl (9:1, v/v) and 100 μL of TMS-diazomethane (Sigma-Aldrich).

The FFA analysis was performed with a GC system (Agilent 7890A)
equipped with a flame ionization detector and DB-5 column (30 m ×
0.25 mm, Agilent Technologies). The FFA concentrations were measured
by comparing each peak with the external standards composed of C10–22 fatty acid methyl esters (Sigma-Aldrich). An oven
temperature of 60 °C was maintained for 2.5 min, increased to
250 °C at 20 °C/min, and maintained for 4 min. Finally,
the temperature was increased to 325 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min,
which was maintained for 5 min.

Statistical Modeling of the Library Coverage and Optimal Seeding
Condition
Two different genetic screening tools that are
similar to a dual-selection system were simultaneously employed in
this fluid array screening process to obtain mutants of ‘TesA
with increased functionality. In our previous research,16 the first screening tool was considered growth-based.
It used the modified genetic circuit for the FFA-dependent tetracycline
resistance gene (tetA) expression, which differentiates
the cellular doubling time to enable the enrichment of cells that
overproduce FFA. The second screening tool was reporter-based and
employed an FFA-sensing reporter system. It showed a dose–response
of fluorescence intensity caused by the presence of intracellular
fatty acids. Optimal experimental conditions of FFA-dependent growth
and RFP expression were previously investigated.

To adequately
cover the mutant library, we constructed a statistical formula (presented
below) derived from the Poisson distribution.25 According to eq 1, P is defined as the probability of covering the whole mutation
library, f is the number of mutants in the library
represented by collected colonies, and N is defined
as the amount of coverage required to get P. 1  

For the 106-random mutation
library of ‘TesA,
an experiment with an initial seeding number of 30 cells per chamber
and 20 fluid array devices was carefully designed after considering
the library coverage. Therefore, according to the above equation (eq 1), the experiment screened
approximately 1.8 × 106 samples, which statistically
covered >95% of the mutation library. Thirty cells were initially
seeded and incubated for 20 h to ensure the differentiation and enrichment
of cells whose growth was FFA-dependent. In addition, the incubation
time enhanced the fluorescence signal from the FAB biosensor plasmid.

In terms of throughput, the 20 fluid array chips prepared and used
in parallel covered >95% of the ‘TesA mutant library. It
was
assumed that 30 unique, initially seeded library cells resulted in
the growth of only a few mutants because the enrichment from FFA-dependent
tetracycline resistance was used as the first selective pressure.
As a second screening method, we measured the fluorescence intensity
in the fluid array device chambers generated by RFP, which corresponded
to the intracellular FFA concentration in a quantitative manner. Samples
with the highest fluorescence intensities (top 1%) were selected.
The cells in the samples were isolated and named as UFM. The fatty
acid production from at least five individual colonies per chamber
was analyzed by GC.

Fabrication of the Fluid Array Device
The microwell
in the fluid array device was 100 μm in diameter and 150 μm
deep having 3000 arrays in a single device (3 × 3 cm). The spacing
between individual arrays on a device was redesigned from 4 ×
2 to 3 × 2 matrices based on the recovery efficiency of the glass
capillary extraction process in our previous work.22 The SU-8 (Microchem 2075, Newton, MA, USA) master mold
was fabricated using standard photolithography processes. The processed
surface of a Si-wafer was silanized using trichloro(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)
silane (Sigma-Aldrich, Korea) in a vacuum jar for 1 h. Polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS, Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit, Dow Corning, Midland, MI,
USA) was then cast, cured, and peeled off to prepare the fluid array
devices. To ensure that the environment was fully moisturized, the
demolded PDMS devices were dipped in distilled water for several hours,
resulting in a fully hydrated state (i.e., the highest solubility
of water into PDMS). This ensured that the aqueous fluid in the microwell
remained stable without apparent volume shrinkage over 24 h. During
long-term incubation (>12 h), the fluid array device was half-dipped
in oil and half-dipped in water to minimize array chamber drying.

Experimental Setup and Data Analysis
An inverted fluorescence
microscope (IX-71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera
(Clara, Andor, Belfast, Northern Ireland) and 1.5×, 10×,
and 20× objective lenses was used to acquire all fluorescence
images from the fluid array device. The images were automatically
acquired using a microscope stage controller (MAC5000/Bioprecision2,
Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY, USA) with a multidimensional
acquisition function from the Metamorph 7.1 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) image software. The fluorescence intensities of the images
were then performed with high-throughput analysis using a custom-made
m-file in MATLAB R2014a (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Image J (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA) and OriginPro 8 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA)
were used for additional data analysis and necessary image processing.
A manually controlled probe positioner (PB50, MS Tech, Hwaseong, Korea)
was used to fix capillary tubes to extract target cells. Target cells
were extracted with fused-silica capillary tubes (CAT no. #1068150011,
Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ, USA) with 25.3 μm inner
diameter and 360 μm outer diameter (OD) and commercially available
insulin syringes with OD = 200 μm.

Experimental Protocol for Screening
The screening procedure
was introduced in our previous work22 and
is shown in Figure 1. The demolded PDMS fluid array devices were treated with oxygen
plasma under 15 sccm of O2 and 70 W for 30 s (Cute-MP,
Femto Science, Hwaseong, Korea). The mutation library in the medium
(M9 minimal, SG: 1.0) with 0.3 mM of IPTG was deposited on the plasma-treated
device to fill all microwell chambers. After removing the residual
medium on the device by the PDMS slab, the device was then placed
onto a Petri dish filled with fluorinated oil (FC-40, SG: 1.61). The
mutant library with approximately 30 cells in each chamber was incubated
for 24 h, and the fluid array device was integrated with the high-throughput
image analysis based on the fluorescent intensity from pFAB of the
mutant library. The device was then flipped over to another Petri
dish filled with hydrocarbon oil (hexadecane, SG: 0.76) to retain
the aqueous volume of the fluid array from the dehydration, so that
top 1% of selective extractions of extraordinary mutants can be performed
using glass capillary tubes for post-analysis of mutant cells. Because
the recovery of the isolated cells was already optimized in the previous
work,22 the isolated mutants were cultured
in fresh medium. Finally, we identified the mutated region of ‘tesA of the isolated mutants for further investigation of
the effects of mutations on FFA production.

Results and Discussion
Isolation of Mutants Producing High Levels of FFA
Several
sensing systems were previously utilized to detect and quantify the
production level of various biochemicals.26,27 To screen mutants overproducing FFAs in the ‘TesA mutant
library, we used a previously constructed FFA biosensor composed of
a TetA-RFP fusion protein under FadR-regulated promoter. In E. coli, the FadR acts as an acyl-CoA-responsive
transcriptional regulator that binds DNA to inhibit the expression
of several genes involved in fatty acid degradation pathway.28 As FFAs can be converted into acyl-CoAs, the
intracellular concentration of acyl-CoAs is well correlated with FFAs
in E. coli.26 In the FAB, high level of acyl-CoAs releases of the protein from
its DNA-binding sites and increases the expression of TetA-RFP under
a FadR-repressed promoter, resulting in high tetracycline resistance
and red fluorescence.16 This FFA biosensor
was employed to selectively isolate highly functional ‘TesA
mutants.16,29 For the screening approach, the fluid array
platform exploited growth-based screening using FFA-dependent tetracycline
resistance during enrichment and reporter-based screening using FFA-dependent
RFP expression. This study used this combined screening approach to
integrate two genetic screening tools into a one-step screening approach.
As previously discussed, we determined that using 30 individual mutant
cells per chamber was appropriate for the FFA-dependent cell growth
in medium containing tetracycline to cover the 106 mutant
library. After incubation in the fluid array platforms and data analysis,
the capillary extraction of cells in the chamber was conducted. Each
cell broth was extracted in descending order of fluorescence signals
produced from each chamber depending on RFP expression (Figure 1). Finally, 18 samples (UFM
1–18) were chosen based on the hybrid screening strategy, and
their FFA production was analyzed by GC (Figure 2). The isolated cells were incubated repeatedly
and compared to the fluorescence signal of the negative control (MG1655)
in visualized images (Figure 3). Mutants showing a higher fluorescent signal also showed
increased FFA production according to the results of GC analysis.

Figure 2 (Left)
All 18 of the isolated mutants were identified as UFM, then
the FFA production yield was analyzed by normalization against FFA
production of E. coli MG1655 expressing
WT ‘TesA. Each UFM strain had mutations in the ‘TesA
gene. (Right) The average FFA production yields were measured by GC
analysis for (i) the mutants selectively extracted by order of fluorescence
intensity and (ii) the randomly extracted 20 mutants.

mutants
and the WT ‘TesA control. (b) Quantified fluorescence intensities
of the four ‘TesA mutants.

To examine possible correlations between the screening
performance
of the fluid array and FFA production levels, the selected mutants
were categorized into two separate groups. The first group consisted
of 18 mutants collected from the top <1% of the chambers that showed
the highest fluorescence intensities from the fluid array device,
and another group of 20 randomly selected samples was used as a comparison
group. The average titer of FFAs from the first group was significantly
higher than that of the second group (Figure 2). The results of the first group with the
higher titer of FFA validated the screening approach used in this
study.

Genetic Identification of the Isolated Mutants
DNA
sequencing was conducted to characterize the ‘TesA mutations
in each mutant as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. The GC analysis data in Figure 2 were plotted against the relative FFA production
levels compared to WT ‘TesA. ‘TesA mutations showed
significant changes in the amino acid sequence of ‘TesA. We
found that some mutations overlapped with our previous findings and
we discovered new ‘TesA mutants that almost doubled FFA production.
The substitution of aspartic acid for glycine at the 74th amino acid
in ‘TesA increased FFA production (Figure 2). This result was consistent with a previous
study showing that a substitution mutation at D74 to G produced 1.5-fold
more FFA.16 D74 resides in an N-terminus
loop (residues 75–80) that moves when ‘TesA interacts
with its substrates. Therefore, Asp 74 might regulate the loop’s
movement during catalysis.30 Therefore,
we hypothesized that substituting at the 74th amino acid influences
the interaction between substrates and ‘TesA, resulting in
higher FFA production. No research has been reported on the 171st
amino acid of ‘TesA; however, it might be involved in increased
FFA production as previously hypothesized.16 A change in 122nd residue of ‘TesA might influence the movement
of F121, which surrounds the substrate-binding crevice, changing the
substrate affinity as a result.30,31 Mutants harboring L7Q,
L4I, and I6V exhibited an approximately 1.4-fold increase in FFA production.
Although the roles of these residues have not been characterized,
mutations in the N-terminal of ‘TesA typically affect its activity.32 It is difficult to explain how two mutations
(i.e., V144A and L51R) can improve FFA production because they have
been neither identified nor examined in previous studies. Mutations
in noncatalytic residues have been known to alter substrate specificity
and ligand binding, driven by structural changes in the protein.33 Therefore, V144A and L51R mutations may act
similarly.

Over the last decade, altering substrate specificity,
enhancing
its activity, and deregulating its allosteric regulation have led
to increases in the production of desired products.34−36 Cells containing
mutations at L7, L51, D74, and V144 have accounted for 33.3, 16.6,
and 11.1% of the 13 mutants isolated from the ‘TesA library,
respectively. This result indicates that the combined screening approach
selectively supports the growth of FFA-overproducing cells in the
fluid array chamber and can identify ‘TesA mutants with enhanced
functionality.

Effect of ‘TesA Mutations on FFA Production
Throughout the fluid array platform screening, several genetic mutants
of ‘TesA were characterized by DNA sequencing the isolated
cells. To confirm that the increase in FFA production was caused by
mutations in ‘TesA (but not by mutations in genes on the same
chromosome such as FAS or acetyl-CoA carboxylase), we verified FFA
production when mutations were introduced into WT MG1655. After transformation
with a plasmid that harbors specific mutations (I6V, L7Q L51R, or
D74G), GC analysis of those mutations showed 1.3–1.7-fold increased
FFA production above that of WT ‘TesA (Figure 4). These results indicate that the isolated
‘TesA mutants directly increase FFA production compared to
the WT ‘TesA without any concerns regarding other mutations
on the chromosomal DNA. With the exception of our earlier work,16 no studies have reported the overproduction
of FFA caused by amino acid alterations in ‘TesA. Therefore,
the ‘TesA mutants with increased functionality identified in
the current study provide proof that combining the fluid array device
and biotechnological approaches can accelerate the production of FFA-derived
chemicals and biofuels.

four mutations. The

Conclusions
Conventional HTS approaches for microbial
screening suffer from
difficulties in compartmentalization and throughput. Our previous
research has attempted to overcome such limitations by applying two
different screening pressures that were genetically designed. In this
study, we utilized a hybrid screening approach composed of two screening
strategies: growth-based screening and reporter gene-based screening.
A random library of 106 mutants was prepared and screened,
resulting in the identification of several ‘TesA mutants that
overproduce fatty acids, showing an almost two-fold increase compared
to the WT ‘TesA. Four mutants (‘TesA with I6V, L7Q,
L51R, and D74G) accounted for approximately 70% of isolated mutants,
indicating that the screening system used in this study successfully
isolated FFA-overproducing cells from the large mutant library. Finally,
we believe that the HTS application used in this study and the isolated
‘TesA mutants may introduce a new direction for the microbial
production of fatty acids throughout the random engineering of the
target gene.
