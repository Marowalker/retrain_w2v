Solvation free energies
of methylated nucleobases were calculated
in pure and hydrated 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [Emim][Ac],
ionic liquid, and pure water using classical molecular dynamics simulations
using multistate Bennett’s acceptance ratio method. The calculated
solvation free energies in pure water were compared with the previous
experimental and theoretical findings and found to be in agreement.
We observe that the solvation free energy of methylated nucleobases
is more in the pure ionic liquid compared to that in the pure water
and on changing the mole fraction of water in the ionic liquid, the
solvation free energy decreases gradually. Comparing the Coulombic
and van der Waals contribution to the solvation free energy, electrostatic
contribution is more compared to that of the latter for all nucleobases.
To obtain the atomistic details and explain the solvation mechanism,
we calculated radial distribution functions (RDFs), spatial distribution
functions (SDFs), and stacking angle distribution of cations to the
nucleobases. From RDFs and SDFs, we find that the acetate anions of
the ionic liquid are forming strong hydrogen bonds with the amine
hydrogen atoms of the nucleobases. These hydrogen bonds contribute
to the major part of the Coulombic contribution to the solvation free
energy. Stacking of cations to the nucleobases is primarily due to
the van der Waals contribution to the solvation free energy.

Introduction
Nucleobases are the
nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic biomolecules,
which are the main constituents of DNA. They are involved in a variety
of nonbonded interactions, like electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic,
and π–π stacking. They are used in many applications,
such as molecular therapeutics, biomimetics, as coordination polymers,
in electronics, and photonics.1−3 They are also utilized in the
agricultural and chemical industries as well.4 Uracil and its derivatives are used as anticancer and antiviral
drugs.5,6 Even though their applications are vast,
they are poorly soluble in water. On the other hand, an alternate
solvent like ionic liquids (ILs) can be used to enhance the solubility
of these molecules. ILs, composed of organic cations and organic as
well inorganic anions with a unique molecular structure, become popular
due to their exceptional solvation abilities. These consist of both
charged as well as hydrophobic domains, which can affect the solubility
of solutes. An increased solubility of the hard-to-dissolve molecular
crystal, 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene, was observed in hydrous
ionic liquid, tetramethylammonium fluoride, as compared to that in
other solvents.7 A phenomenal increase
in solubility of nucleobases was found in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
acetate, [Emim][Ac] and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, and [Bmim][Ac]
relative to water.8,9 In these systems, the hydrogen
bonding between the acetate anion of the ionic liquid and amine groups
of nucleobase is the primary factor of dissolution mechanism. The
aromatic hydrogen atoms of imidazolium cation also form weak hydrogen
bonds with the carbonyl oxygen atom and ring nitrogen atoms of nucleobases.
Norman et al. studied the solvation structure of uracil in [Emim][Ac]
at different solvent/solute ratios using neutron diffraction techniques.10 These ionic liquids are viscous, and the viscosity
further increases upon addition of nucleobases, which affects the
solubilizing capacity of solvent toward more quantity of nucleobases.
The cosolvents are added to overcome this problem; on adding moderate
amount of water to ionic liquids, solubility of nucleobases is not
affected but the viscosities of the resultant mixtures decrease significantly.11 In many applications, the cosolvents alter the
intermolecular interactions that affect the solubility of sparingly
soluble compounds. The solvation nature of the solvent toward a particular
solute can be understood by assessing a thermodynamic quantity, solvation
free energy. The link between solvation free energy and solubilizing
nature of a particular solvent can be understood by investigating
molecular level interactions that can happen during the solvation
process. Several studies reported the solvation free energies of pharmaceutical
drugs,12−16 amino acid analogues,17−21 nucleic acid bases,22−30 and other organic molecules13,31−34 in various solvents using different analytical methods. These methods
include free-energy perturbation,35 thermodynamic
integration,36 Bennett and multistate Bennett’s
acceptance ratio (MBAR),37,38 and quantum mechanics
(QM)-based39,40 and classical models.41 The nucleobases are involved in a variety of
nonbonded interactions, like electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic,
and π–π stacking. The presence of neutral and ionic
cosolvents affects these interactions. Recently, Jumbri et al. calculated
the solvation free energies of parent nucleobases in imidazolium-based
bromide ionic liquids with changing alkyl chain length of the cation
using the Bennett acceptance ratio method.30 They found that the values of solvation free energy of nucleobases
were more negative in ionic liquid compared to those in pure water.
The polar bases prefer to solvate by short alkyl chains of IL, and
the less polar bases show better solubility in ILs with long alkyl
chains. The stability of DNA duplex increases in hydrated ionic liquids
compared to that in the aqueous solution.42 The direct chemical modification to the DNA is called DNA methylation.
This methylation process can affect dynamics of many biorelevant processes.
The methylated nucleobases can be simple models to study the solvation
dynamics of chemically modified biomolecules. So far, there is no
study on solvation free energy of methylated nucleobases in pure and
hydrated ionic liquids. It is essential to understand the thermodynamics
and solvation mechanism of methylated nucleobases in pure and hydrated
ionic liquids to improve and tune their solubility.

In this
study, we report the solvation free energies of methylated
nucleobases in pure and hydrated ionic liquids of [Emim][Ac] with
changing mole fractions of water using classical molecular dynamics
simulations. Experimental results for solubility of nucleobases are
available in this ionic liquid with changing mole fraction of water.
In our study, N9 nitrogen atom is methylated in adenine and guanine;
N1 nitrogen atom is methylated in thymine, cytosine, and uracil. These
nitrogen atoms are linked to deoxyribose sugar in DNA; so methylated
nucleobases represent the mimic of nucleobases in DNA, which may help
us in understanding the stability of DNA in hydrated ionic liquid.
Along with structural properties, Coulombic and van der Waals contributions
to the solvation free energy are also calculated to quantify the major
interactions contributing to the solubility of these nucleobases.
We investigate the molecular interactions between solute and solvent
molecules using the center of mass (COM) along with atom–atom
radial and spatial distribution functions (SDFs). The probability
distributions of the stacking angle of Emim cation with nucleobases
are calculated, which provide the information about the stacking of
cation with nucleobases. The objective of the work is to understand
the solvation and solubility of methylated nucleobases in IL from
the thermodynamic point of view, and the atomic level interactions
of anion and cation of IL with nucleobases in the form of Coulombic
and van der Waals contribution. From these contributions, it is evident
that the stacking of cation with methylated nucleobases is also responsible
for solubility of nucleobases in this ionic liquid. We choose this
ionic liquid due to its good solubility nature toward nucleobases.
Even though it is viscous, it is well known that adding a moderate
amount of water to the ionic liquid can decrease the viscosity of
the ionic liquid without affecting the solubility. The experimental
solubility data of pristine nucleobases in this ionic liquid with
changing mole fraction of water was available for the comparison.
By knowing the key interactions between solute and solvent, which
leads to more solubility, we can design nontoxic, biodegradable, and
amino acid-based ionic liquids (Table 1).

Results and Discussion
Solvation free energy is a thermodynamic quantity, which can describe
the solubility of a solute in a particular solvent. We calculated
this quantity for methylated nucleobases in pure water, pure IL, and
various mole fractions of hydrated ILs. The obtained solvation free-energy
values of methylated nucleobases in pure water are tabulated in Table 2. To check the reliability
of our results from the method we used, the results from the previous
methods and experiments are also listed for comparison including those
from similar models. Experimental values for solvation free energies
are available for comparison only for methylated adenine and methylated
thymine. For both bases, the calculated solvation free energies in
our work are overestimated by ∼1 kcal mol–1, as compared to the experimental values.43 Our reported solvation free-energy values are in close agreement
with previously calculated values using AM1/SM2 method except for
methylated adenine.23 The results are qualitatively
in agreement with previously calculated solvation free energies using
QM/molecular mechanics (MM) method except for the same base.44 Among all nucleobases, m-guanine has more negative
solvation free energy (−22.6 kcal mol–1),
whereas m-thymine and m-uracil have less and almost similar values
(−13.4 and −13.9 kcal mol–1). The
results show the following trend in solvation free energy: m-guanine
> m-cytosine > m-adenine > m-uracil > m-thymine. This
trend indicates
that m-guanine is more soluble in pure water when compared to other
nucleobases and m-thymine is less soluble. From the previous study,
less polar bases had lower solubility30 as compared with others. The trend in solvation free energy for
pure bases in water found in the early study was: guanine > cytosine
> thymine > uracil > adenine.30 Overall
the bases, guanine, cytosine, and uracil, follow a similar trend in
solvation free energy, whereas the pattern is changed for methylation
of adenine and thymine (Figure 1).

The solvation free energies of methylated
nucleobases in pure as
well as hydrated ionic liquids with changing mole fraction of water
and in pure water are shown in Figure 2. The convergence of solvation free-energy values is
shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S1. The standard deviations for solvation free energies are within
1 kcal mol–1 for all nucleobases throughout all
mole fractions and are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S2). All methylated nucleobases show more
negative solvation free energies in pure ionic liquid when compared
to water; this is in agreement with the previous study on solvation
free energies of parent nucleobases in pure imidazolium-based ionic
liquids.30 The nucleobases are polar and
more soluble in ionic liquids whose polarity is more than water. The
solvation free energy trend for the nucleobases in the pure ionic
liquid is similar to the values of bases in the pure water: m-guanine
> m-cytosine > m-adenine > m-uracil > m-thymine. The difference
between
free energies of nucleobases in pure ionic liquid and pure water also
follows the same trend. This trend is based on the number of polar
sites available on methylated nucleobases. m-Guanine has more number
of polar sites among all nucleobases: each of NH2, NH,
and C=O groups. Cytosine contains one each of NH2 and C=O groups; adenine has one NH2 group; thymine
and uracil have each one NH and two C=O groups. Even though
m-adenine has only one NH2 group, it is more polar than
m-uracil and m-thymine, because it also has three unprotonated nitrogen
ring atoms, which can form polar interactions. m-Guanine and m-cytosine
also have two and one unprotonated nitrogen ring atom, respectively.
Although m-thymine and m-uracil are having the same number and type
of polar groups, m-uracil has slightly more negative solvation free
energy. The reason for this is that a methyl group in m-thymine is
attached close to the C=O group, which prevents interaction
of C=O group with the solvent molecules, whereas there is no
methyl group nearby C=O group in m-uracil that can freely interact
with the solvent molecules. The acetate anions of the ionic liquids,
which are good hydrogen bond acceptors compared with the water, are
the primary interacting entities with the nucleobases. They form hydrogen
bonds with the amino groups of the nucleobases. Emim cation has acidic
hydrogen atoms that can form hydrogen bond with C=O groups
and unprotonated nitrogen ring atoms of nucleobases. The interaction
of these polar sites with the solvent molecules is discussed explicitly
in the following paragraphs. As we go from the pure ionic liquid to
the pure water with changing mole fraction of water, the solvation
free energies increase for all nucleobases. In the case of m-guanine,
a steady increase of solvation free energy is observed with changing
mole fraction. For remaining nucleobases, the increase in solvation
free energy is found up to Xw = 0.4; however,
from Xw = 0.4 to 0.8 the change in solvation
free energy is less significant, followed by a sudden change in values
after Xw = 0.8.

Figure 2 Solvation free energy
of methylated nucleobases with changing mole
fraction of water.

The values of relative
solubility of nucleobases in pure ionic
liquid and hydrated ionic liquids as compared to those in pure water
are shown in Figure 3. The solubility values of methylated nucleobases in pure and hydrated
ionic liquids are presented in this figure considering the solubility
in pure water as the reference. This property can be used to compare
the solubility of nucleobases with experimental values. The relative
solubility is high for methylated nucleobases in pure ionic liquid,
and it decreases with increasing mole fraction of water. This fact
is in agreement with the experimental solubility measurements of parent
nucleobases in pure and hydrated ionic liquids.11 We also calculated the Coulombic and van der Waals contribution
to the solvation free energy, and the values are shown in Figure 4. van der Waals contribution
to the solvation free energy of nucleobases in pure water is insignificant,
and electrostatic interactions play a dominating role. Nucleobases
are soluble in pure water due to hydrogen bonding interactions between
polar sites of nucleobases and solvent. In the case of pure and hydrated
ionic liquids, the contribution from Coulombic interactions is more
compared to van der Waals contribution; the hydrogen bonding plays
a significant role in solubilizing the nucleobases. van der Waals
contribution is due to the stacking (π–π) interactions
of Emim cations to the nucleobases. The contribution from Coulombic
interaction also follows the same trend (mG > mC > mA > mU
> mT) as
that of solvation free energy for nucleobases. As discussed in the
introduction, the stability of the DNA duplex in hydrated ionic liquids
can be explained by using the relative solubility, which is derived
from solvation free energy of methylated nucleobases. Relative solubility
of mG and mC nucleobases is more compared to that of mA and mT in
pure and hydrated ionic liquids. As a result, G–C base pair
is more prone to be solubilized in hydrated ionic liquids, which will
destabilize DNA duplex. However, A–T base pair, responsible
for stabilizing DNA, has less solubility.

methylated nucleobases in pure and hydrated
ionic liquids with reference to pure water with changing mole fractions

Figure 4 Coulombic and van der Waals contribution to
the solvation free
energy of methylated nucleobases with changing mole fractions of water.

To understand the solvation environment
of nucleobases with changing
mole fractions of water, we calculated several radial distribution
functions (RDFs). The radial distribution functions of the center
of mass (COM) of cation with the COM of nucleobase with number integrals
are shown in Figure 5. We observe the minima for first peaks of Emim cations and nucleobases’
RDFs between 0.45 and 0.5 nm. The RDF peak heights for the first solvation
shell of mA and mG are more than the second solvation shell peak heights,
whereas, for mT, mC, and mU, the second solvation shell peak heights
are more than the first solvation shell peak heights. Emim cations
interact with mA and mG nucleobases through stacking interactions;
however, this stacking interaction is relatively less in the case
of mT, mC, and mU nucleobases. Calculated coordination numbers (CNs)
are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S3). The CNs of cations around mA and mG are close to one except Xw = 0.4 for mA; at least one Emim cation is
involved in stacking interaction with the nucleobase. The CNs of cation
around mT, mC, and mU bases are less compared to those around other
two bases. These numbers correlate to the van der Waals contribution
to the solvation free energy: ∼7 kcal mol–1 for both mA and mG. This value is ∼5 kcal mol–1 for mT, mC, and mU bases. The radial distribution functions of the
COM of acetate anion with the COM of nucleobase with number integrals
with changing mole fractions of water are shown in the Supporting
Information (Figure S2). We observe the
extension of the first solvation shell of acetate anion around nucleobases
between 0.6 and 0.8 nm for all nucleobases. The CNs are high for mA
and mG, as these bases are bigger in size and having more polar sites
compared with mT, mC, and mU. These numbers decrease with the increase
in mole fraction of water. The corresponding RDFs for water and nucleobases
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). In general, the CN increases with increasing mole fraction
of water and more number of anions come close to the nucleobases.
The corresponding spatial distribution functions (SDFs) of cation,
anion, and water around nucleobases are shown in Figure 6 for Xw = 0.2 and 0.8. SDFs of the remaining mole fractions are shown
in the Supporting Information (Figure S4). Cations are distributed above and below the plane of nucleobase
primarily due to the stacking interaction. However, the distribution
of anion is found near the amine groups of nucleobases as a result
of the hydrogen bonding. As we move from pure ionic liquid to pure
water, we find the decrease in this distribution as contrary to increase
in water distribution. In intermediate concentrations, both acetate
ion and water molecules compete with each other for the hydrogen bonding
with amine groups of the nucleobases.

integrals of COM of methylated
nucleobase and COM of Emim cation with changing mole fractions of

(C) m-adenine, (D) m-uracil, and (E) m-thymine. Color schemes are
as follows: magenta cation, green anion, orange water.

The interactions between nucleobase and solvent
molecules are primarily
governed by the hydrogen bonding interactions. There are two types
of amine groups present in nucleobases: primary amine (exocyclic NH2 group) and secondary amine (ring NH group). The primary amine
group interacts with solvents differently compared with secondary
amine. These amine groups can undergo hydrogen bonding with both water
and acetate anion. The atom–atom RDFs between primary amine
hydrogens and acetate oxygen atoms and primary amine hydrogens and
water oxygen atoms for mA, mG, and mC nucleobases are shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S5). The
first minima for all RDFs are found at around 0.25 nm. The peak height
represents a strong hydrogen bonding interaction between primary amine
and acetate groups. This height for RDFs involving acetate oxygen
atoms decreases with increasing mole fraction of water. For mG, we
do not see the well-defined first peak for Xw = 0.2 and 0.4 as for mA and mC; however, it appears from Xw = 0.6. Moreover, for mG, the peak height is
less compared to that of mA and mC nucleobases due to the presence
of a secondary amine group close to the primary amine group. The atom–atom
RDFs between secondary amine hydrogens and acetate oxygen atoms and
secondary amine hydrogens and water oxygen atoms for mT, mG, and mU
nucleobases are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S6). In this case, we also observe the first minima
at around 0.25 nm. The peak heights are more when compared to that
in the case of primary amine hydrogen atoms; the hydrogen bonding
interaction is stronger with secondary amines compared with primary
amines. The height of first peaks of RDFs for acetate oxygen atoms
with secondary amine hydrogens decreases with increase in mole fractions
of water. Overall, we could not establish any trend in interaction
between secondary amine group of nucleobases and the water molecules
due to competition for preferential hydrogen bonding with the acetate
anion.

We also present atom–atom RDFs between oxygen
atoms of nucleobases
and water hydrogen atoms. The corresponding RDFs are shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S7). In
this case, we observe the first minima at 0.25 nm except in a few
cases. For all bases, the peak heights increase with increase in water
mole fractions as compared with pure water. Atom–atom RDFs
between oxygen atoms of methylated nucleobase and Emim acidic hydrogen
atoms have been calculated and are also shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S8). The first minima, in this
case, are very broad and can be found around 0.4 nm. The peak heights
are less compared to those in the RDFs involving water hydrogen atoms,
indicating very weak hydrogen bond interaction. The RDFs between ring
nitrogen atoms of nucleobase and Emim acidic hydrogens and ring nitrogen
atoms and water hydrogen atoms are shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S9). We observe first minima at
0.35 nm in the case of Emim acidic hydrogens, which shows a moderate
hydrogen bonding between ring nitrogen atoms and Emim hydrogens. The
peak height is not significant and vanishes with increasing mole fraction
of water for mA and mG; however, the peak height is more for mC. The
first minima are observed at 0.25 nm in the case of water hydrogens.
In all cases, the peak height increases up to Xw = 0.8, contrary to that for pure water.

As mentioned
earlier, another important interaction between Emim
cation and methylated nucleobase is the stacking interaction; the
aromatic rings of cations can stack with the nucleobase aromatic rings.
We calculated the probability distributions of the stacking angle
of Emim cations with methylated nucleobases. The schematic representation
of angles and COM–COM distance (R) between
Emim cation and methylated nucleobase used in the calculation is shown
in Figure 7. We define R as the distance between the center of masses of nucleobase
ring atoms and cation ring atoms. ni and nj are the normal vectors to the planes of nucleobase
and Emim cation ring, respectively. These vectors are the cross product
of two vectors, which are lying in the plane of nucleobases and the
cation ring. The vectors in the plane are defined from the center
of mass of base and cation to any of the ring atoms. The representation
of these vectors are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S10). θ is the angle between the
normal vector (ni) to the plane of nucleobase
and the vector R. α is the angle between normal
vectors ni and nj that represents the stacking angle between nucleobase and cation.
We calculated the distribution of angle α only when it satisfies
two conditions: (a) R < 0.45 nm, which is the
position of minimum of COM–COM RDF of cation and nucleobase,
(b) the angle θ should be in between 0 < θ < 60°
or 120 < θ < 180°. If the angle θ is not in
the range mentioned above, then it is considered that the cation is
not in the proper stacking position. The distribution of angle α
with a bin width of 5° for all nucleobases with changing mole
fractions of water is shown in Figure 8. We see the probability distribution of angle α
is more at ∼15 and ∼165° for all nucleobases and
all mole fractions. The distribution at ∼15° represents
the stacking of cation to the nucleobase from the top, whereas the
distribution at ∼165° represents the stacking of cation
to the nucleobase from the bottom. We see the probability distribution
of the stacking angle is more in the case of m-adenine and m-guanine
as compared to that in remaining nucleobases. The reason is mA and
mG have purine rings that consist of both six-membered and five-membered
rings fused together, whereas other nucleobases have six-membered
pyrimidine ring. The corresponding stacked structures indicated in Figure 8A–J are extracted
from the trajectory and are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S11). The excess and significant solvation
free energy in the case of pure and hydrated ionic liquid is coming
from van der Waals interaction that is the stacking of the Emim cations
with the methylated nucleobases; cations play a major role in the
solubility of methylated nucleobases in pure and hydrated ionic liquids.

Conclusions
In this study, we have
calculated the solvation free energy of
methylated nucleobases in pure ionic liquid [Emim][Ac] hydrated ionic
liquids with changing mole fractions of water and in pure water. The
solvation free energies in pure water are in good agreement with previous
experimental and theoretical calculations. The free energies of nucleobases
follow the trend: mG > mC > mA > mU > mT both in pure
ionic liquid
and in pure water. Relative solubility of methylated nucleobases in
pure and hydrated ionic liquids with reference to pure water are also
calculated, which is more for nucleobases in the pure ionic liquid
as compared to that in hydrated ionic liquids. It decreases with increasing
mole fractions of water. The order of solvation free energy in pure
water changed only for adenine and thymine when we are going from
pristine to methylated nucleobases. The methylation of nucleobases
can cause changes in the electronic structure of the nucleobase, which
reflects in the charges of atoms in the nucleobases due to electron-donating
methyl group. However, the difference between solvation free energies
of adenine, thymine, and uracil in pristine and methylated (current
study) nucleobases is very small when compared to that of guanine
and cytosine. A small structural modification can cause the change
in the order of these three nucleobases. Coulombic contribution to
the solvation free energies is more compared to the van der Waals
contribution in pure and hydrated ionic liquids, whereas in pure water,
the Coulombic contribution plays a major role than the negligible
van der Waals contribution. Reported solvation free energies and relative
solubility of methylated nucleobases may help in understanding the
stability of DNA duplex in hydrated ionic liquids. The center of mass
and atom–atom RDFs and SDFs were calculated to interpret the
solvation environment of nucleobases in pure and hydrated ionic liquids.
The CN values of Emim cations around nucleobases is more for mA and
mG compared to that for mT, mC, and mU. The number of acetate anions
around nucleobase decreases, but the CN of water increases with addition
of more water to IL. In SDFs, we see the distribution of cation above
and below the plane of nucleobase that indicates the stacking of cation
with nucleobases. The distribution near the carbonyl oxygen atoms
and ring nitrogen atoms of base represents the weak hydrogen bonding
of acidic hydrogen atoms of Emim with these atoms. The distribution
of anion and water close to the amine hydrogens of nucleobases represents
the hydrogen bond between these groups. From the peak heights of the
corresponding RDFs, it is evident that acetate anions of the ionic
liquid form a strong hydrogen bond with the secondary amine hydrogens
compared with primary amine hydrogens of nucleobases. As the mole
fraction of the water is increased, the strength of the hydrogen bond
gets weak and water molecules compete with acetate anions to form
hydrogen bonds with amine groups of nucleobases. The acidic hydrogens
of Emim cation also form a weak-to-moderate hydrogen bonding with
the carbonyl oxygen atoms and ring nitrogen atoms of nucleobases.
The probability distribution of the stacking angle of Emim cations
with nucleobases is calculated and it is found that the stacking angle
distribution is more at ∼15 and ∼165°. The stacking
conformations corresponding to these stacking angles were extracted
and it was found that the distribution at 15° represents the
stacking of cation to the nucleobase from the top, whereas the distribution
at 165° represents the stacking from the bottom. Overall, the
solubility of methylated nucleobases is more in pure and hydrated
ionic liquids as compared to that of pure water, which is evident
from the solvation free energies. More than 95% of the solvation free
energy is coming from the Coulombic interactions in the case of pure
water as solvent. However, van der Waals contribution is very small
and negligible. Hydrogen bonding of acetate anion and water molecules
with the amine groups of methylated nucleobases correspond to the
Coulombic part of the solvation free energy, which is equivalent to
the Coulombic contribution of the solvation free energy in pure water.
The stacking of cation with nucleobases corresponds to the excess
solvation free energy in the form of van der Waals interaction.

Computational
Methodology
We performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations,
where all
interactions were modeled using conventional potential energy function,
the sum of bonded and nonbonded energy terms. Bonded energy is comprised
of bond stretching, bending, and dihedral potentials. Nonbonded energy
constitutes van der Waals interactions and electrostatic interactions,
which are represented by the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential and Coulomb
potential, respectively.      kr, kθ, and kφ are coefficients for bond stretching, bending, and
dihedrals, respectively; rij, εij, and σij are the site separation distances between atoms i and j, well depth of the LJ potential
energy profile, and distance at which LJ interaction is zero. respectively. qi and qj are the partial charges of atoms.

The methylated nucleobases, Emim cation, and acetate anion were
optimized followed by the Merz–Kollman charge calculation45 using density functional theory method employing
B3LYP exchange correlation functional. 6-31g(d) and 6-311+g(2d,p)
basis sets were used for methylated nucleobases and ionic entities,
respectively, using Gaussian 09 software package.46 The ball and stick models of the five bases and ions of
IL with the atom names are shown in Figure 1. The charges for atoms were obtained using
restrained electrostatic potential47 method
and these were scaled to 0.8 for Emim and acetate ions; the scaling
produced good density (1.078 g cm–3) compared to
that from experimental48 data (1.099 g
cm–3). Water was modeled with extended simple point
charge model;49 IL and methylated nucleobases
were modeled with generalized AMBER force field50 using Antechamber module of AMBERTools.51 The details of the number of ions and water molecules used
in different mole fractions of systems are provided in Table 1.

The starting coordinates
of all systems were prepared using packmol
software package.52 The systems were first
minimized using the steepest descent minimization algorithm for 2000
steps. Then, we heated the systems to 600 K within a span of 1 ns
and cooled back to 300 K within the same span of simulation time to
get a homogeneous mixture of water and the ionic liquid. Then, the
systems were equilibrated within NVT ensemble for 2 ns, followed by
an NpT simulation for 5 ns. Again, the systems were equilibrated for
another 20 ns in NVE ensemble using the equilibrated average box length
obtained from NpT simulation. The average size of the simulation box
lengths for all nucleobases with changing mole fractions of water
is incorporated in the Supporting Information (Table S1). The final coordinates from NVE simulation were
used for free-energy simulations. The time step used in each simulation
was 2 fs. We used velocity rescale method53 for controlling temperature and the Berendson barostat54 for controlling pressure of the system, with
coupling constants 0.1 and 1.0 ps, respectively, for the initial equilibration
simulations. In the final free-energy simulations, we used stochastic
dynamics using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat55 with a coupling constant of 1.0 ps. Electrostatic interactions
were treated with particle mesh Ewald56 method with a cutoff of 1.2 nm, and van der Waals cutoff was taken
to be 1.2 nm. All simulations were performed using Gromacs 5.0.457 simulation package. We employed multistage free-energy
perturbation approach with the multistate Bennett’s acceptance
ratio (MBAR) method.37,38,58,59 We used coupling parameter λ to control
the LJ and the electrostatic interactions between solute and solvent.
The coupling parameter for LJ interactions was changed from 0 to 1
in six stages (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0), and electrostatic
interactions were changed in four stages (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0),
keeping the LJ interaction to 1. Each window of λ was equilibrated
for 16 ns under NpT ensemble. Relative solubility of methylated nucleobases
in pure and hydrated ionic liquids with pure water was calculated
using the following equation60,61  where c1,i and c1,water correspond to the
molar concentration of methylated nucleobase in solvent i (pure and hydrated ionic liquid) and water, respectively. μ1,waterres,∞ is the residual chemical potential of nucleobase infinitely diluted
in water, and μ1,ires,∞ is the residual chemical
potential of nucleobase infinitely diluted in pure and hydrated ionic
liquid. The residual chemical potential is defined as the difference
between the chemical potentials of solute in the solution phase and
gas phase. In the case of the pure solvent, this difference is equal
to the solvation free energy of the solute. In our case, we assumed
the hydrated ionic liquid mixtures as pure solvents to calculate the
relative solubility of nucleobases in hydrated ionic liquid with water.  β is the reciprocal
of kBT, kB is
the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
μ1,ires was computed using python implementation
of MBAR (pyMBAR), https://github.com/choderalab/pymbar.
