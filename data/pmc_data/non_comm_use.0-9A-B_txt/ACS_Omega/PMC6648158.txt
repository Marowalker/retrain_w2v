There is an increasing focus on the
part of academic institutions,
funding agencies, and publishers, if not researchers themselves, on
preservation and sharing of research data. Motivations for sharing
include research integrity, replicability, and reuse. One of the barriers
to publishing data is the extra work involved in preparing data for
publication once a journal article and its supporting information
have been completed. In this work, a method is described to generate
both human and machine-readable supporting information directly from
the primary instrumental data files and to generate the metadata to
ensure it is published in accordance with findable, accessible, interoperable,
and reusable (FAIR) guidelines. Using this approach, both the human
readable supporting information and the primary (raw) data can be
submitted simultaneously with little extra effort. Although traditionally
the data package would be sent to a journal publisher for publication
alongside the article, the data package could also be published independently
in an institutional FAIR data repository. Workflows are described
that store the data packages and generate metadata appropriate for
such a repository. The methods both to generate and to publish the
data packages have been implemented for NMR data, but the concept
is extensible to other types of spectroscopic data as well.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Recent
studies have examined the rationale for greater sharing
of primary research data among scientists, including in chemistry.1 A number of benefits have been suggested including
research integrity and replicability and reuse by peers. Some prominent
cases of data manipulation and fraudulent data have been uncovered
in recent years,2,3 the expectation is that upon publishing
the primary research data associated with an experiment, it becomes
more difficult to manipulate data in a way that cannot be detected.
The ease with which data can be manipulated or manufactured varies
by technique, and although some attempts can be detected by human
inspection, others would undoubtedly escape even simple algorithmic
techniques. Upon the discovery of manipulated data, the crystallography
community recently recommended that CIF data can be accompanied by
structure factors in an attempt to reduce fraud.4 Structure factors had been considered of minimal importance
once the CIF format for crystal structures became standard for publishing
and sharing crystal data, but it is now realized that these parameters
are less susceptible to manipulation than the processed data recorded
in the CIF files. Because of the cultural norms in the crystallography
community, the expected deposit of CIF files has resulted in relatively
straightforward methods to store both CIF and structure factors, to
validate the formats and the data using tools such as checkCIF, and
to display the data in both publications and interactively via online
publication.

Another proposed benefit of making primary data
available is the
utilization of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) approaches
to process data, to enhance existing methods for the prediction of
properties of chemical structures, to develop new materials, to discover
new drugs, and so on.5 Ultimately, the
goal of these AI/ML techniques would be to understand the science
well enough to propose new scientific theories. Whether the latter
is feasible, the use of AI/ML techniques requires a large quantity
of data in an understandable and reusable format.

Archiving
and sharing of analytical raw data are also pivotal for
the development of new signal processing algorithms aimed at extracting
information that has been elusive to existing methods. For instance,
although the Fourier transform (FT) method has proved to be the gold
standard for the processing of NMR data because of its computational
performance and robustness, it also has well-known limitations such
as poor resolving power, leakage artifacts (i.e. Gibbs
oscillations), and phase and baseline distortions. There are presently
many other alternatives to the FT method that can overcome these deficiencies
or new ones that might be developed in the future. Those new methods
could potentially uncover new information (i.e., new signals invisible
to old methods) that can be used to, for example, prove or discard
a chemical structure as inferred with different methods. Obviously,
this can be only done if the primary acquired data is preserved. Furthermore,
even raw data is generally stored with some loss of information. For
example, NMR data is acquired by accumulating many scans to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. However, only the final averaged FID is
kept, whereas all the individual transients are thrown away. Although
this is usually not a concern, there are some advanced processing
techniques that could be used to take advantage of the information
contained within the individual scans.6

For experimental data other than that for crystal structures,
instruments
have the ability to export in standard formats. For spectroscopic
data, JCAMP-DX is a veritable common export format for data sharing,
although it has yet to achieve widespread adoption.7 Although the format has some disadvantages in the nonstandard
ways in which instrument manufacturers have added custom parameters,
it is still useful for understanding the basic data. However, there
are two disadvantages with using export formats for spectroscopic
or instrumental data. First, the exported data may be processed data
and hence subject to manipulation. Second, the steps to generate the
data objects for publications either as selected lists of peaks for
the experimental section in the body of the article or as figures
in the body of the article or in the supporting information are labor intensive and result in some loss of
information. Once those traditional publishable objects have been
prepared, it would be an additional human effort to generate and organize
the machine-readable data files for submission as supporting information. Although many publications allow submission
of supporting information data files, most
publications do not require the raw data. There have been few other
incentives for researchers to do the extra work to prepare the data
files for publication, but most do not. This situation is changing.
For instance, a new NMR file format has been recently proposed, NMReData,8 although its scope is limited to structure characterization
of small molecules (i.e., NMR assignments). This format is essentially
an extension of the existing structure data format (SDF) and includes
the so-called NMR record, which is a compressed folder that, in addition
to the NMReDATA file, contains all related 1D and 2D spectra including
the raw data such as the FIDs and all the acquisition and processing
parameters.

Funding agencies are starting to issue policies
that require researchers
to preserve and share the research data collected during the course
of a research grant. Government funding agencies, for example in the
United States, U.K., EU, and Australia, as well as private foundations,
such as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Wellcome Trust, and Gates
Foundation, are mandating that research data in support of journal
articles be published in a reusable form. In addition, while data
repositories have been common in discipline specific areas for many
years and in fact have appeared and disappeared, more generic data
repositories such as Figshare,9 Data Dryad,10 and Dataverse11 are
now available for researchers to store their experimental details.
Data journals are also being established to allow researchers to publish
and get credit for data collection. These include, for example, Data
Science,12 Nature Scientific Data,13 MethodsX,14 and SoftwareX.15 When publishing in these data journals, researchers
can get credit in the form of a citation for data and/or software
publication and at the same time also get credit for publishing a
traditional article describing the results and conclusions of the
research. Community norms are still emerging as to how these publications
will be treated in terms of scientific recognition.

The rigor
with which researchers actually comply with funding agency
mandates is now a subject of much debate in the research data community.
Neylon has proposed that the focus shifts from development of data
sharing policies to culture change.16 His
argument is that although policies are important, they focus on changing
individual behavior. Given the barriers to data sharing, such as lack
of understanding of how to go about sharing data and the need to commit
extra human and funding resources to sharing data, a change in culture
to promote data sharing would help to motivate researchers to change
their individual behavior.

Even though one might agree that
an ideal state would be for all
primary research data in support of scientific publication to be made
publicly available, there are still constraints even in a digital
environment with vast amounts of inexpensive storage available. A
typical organic synthesis article might include three or four NMR
experiments for each of 30–40 substances. Generating the supporting information file consisting of graphical
representations of the NMR data with headings, structure diagrams,
and sampling parameters is particularly time-consuming. Furthermore,
such documents can grow to be very large, there are examples now of supporting information approaching or even exceeding
1000 pages.17 An alternative approach would
facilitate ways in which the researcher can organize and store the
FID files as a package for submission as a dataset or a fileset. Because
the FID files are the basis for both the data package and the graphical
SI data, a workflow that allowed for the generation of both forms
of SI at the same time would remove one of the barriers to submission
of full/raw data. Although this approach is consistent with the general
concept that content should be stored in canonical form and rendered
as appropriate at the time of delivery to the user,18 it also achieves one of the hallmarks of publication—that
the reader has the option if they wish for a static representation
of what the author intended, while at the same time, the interested
reader, whether human or machine, has access to both a more interactive
and/or a lossless version of the same data.

2 Results
and Discussion
The Mpublish project aims to address the twin
challenges of increasing
the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability
(FAIR) of spectroscopic research data19 and facilitating the preparation of such data for publication using
automated workflows. The first two sections will describe two key
features of the Mpublish project, that is,an automated workflow for the author to prepare the
data for publication and

a signing system
for the publisher, which allows the
reader to review the data while addressing reuse and interoperability
of the data.



The last section will describe
how deposition in the Imperial College
Data Repository ensures data FAIRness.

2.1 Preparation
of Primary Research Data for Publication
Using an Automated Mpublish Workflow
The Mpublish author
workflow has been implemented as a plugin of the Mnova software platform20 and is now being integrated into the Mgears
automation system within Mnova. Although this limits its use to researchers
and scientists that have licensed access to the Mnova software for
the processing of their NMR, LC/GC/MS, and optical spectroscopic primary
data, the Mnova software does have the advantage that it is widely
adopted by the chemistry research community.

The Mpublish workflow
generates a complete package ready to be submitted to a specific journal
from primary datasets (.mnova or raw data files) that has been satisfactorily
processed, analyzed, and annotated within the Mnova platform (see
further details on the Mpublish author workflow in Supporting Information and Figure S1). Using the Mpublish
user interface, the author will be able toeasily select the data they want to publish, either
by following a system of file masks, which match the organization
of the data on disk, or by following a system of multiselection or
a specific metadata field on the spectral database (Figure S2),

choose a journal
template,

enter author information (name,
organization, etc.).



Subsequent execution
of the Mpublish author functionality will
run an automated process (implemented as an Mnova script based on
ECMAScript)21 and will generateindividual spectrum figures with
the corresponding file
title, acquisition parameters, and peak list (multiplicity, chemical
shifts) templated to the selected journal (Figure 1),

an ODT (open
document text) file including all the processed
data (figure, peak list, etc.), and

a
folder containing the primary raw data used to generate
these processed and analyzed data (subfolder and files renamed and
reorganized to identify the datasets and match them with the titles
included in the automatically generated aforementioned ODT zip file).



Figure 1 1H NMR spectrum ready for publication.

The automatically generated ODT
file22 can be edited and used to prepare
the final supporting information (SI) file
intended for submission along
with the manuscript and along with inclusion of experimental procedures
and other appropriate data. The preparation of NMR data for the SI document is thus greatly facilitated by use
of the Mpublish automation.

Overall, the advantages of the Mpublish
workflow aresimultaneous generation
of a folder including the NMR
data (zip file) along with an SI document
(ODT file) presenting and describing the data (figure, peak list)
in line with a selected journal template,

easy modification of the SI document (to
satisfy referee comments, to change the template) by
using the Mpublish user interface, which will allow to select/remove
data and modify author information and journal template, and

generation of primary data available in
machine-actionable
form, enabling data mining and aggregation.



2.2 Signing System Allowing Reusability and Interoperability
of Primary Research Data
A second aspect of the Mpublish
project is the ability for the publisher (e.g., the data repository
owner) to cryptographically “sign” a dataset, which
will be possible for the reader to review using Mnova software, without
the cost associated with the software license. This will allow the
reader to analyze the research data more extensively than with a static
PDF.

2.2.1 Publisher’s Perspective
To enable
this feature, the publisher has to provide Mestrelab with
a public key, which will be used to sign the data and compose an Mnova
publication text file (mnpub). The mnpub file will point to the primary
research data (mnova or zip file) and hold both the signature and
the public key information. An mnpub file will have to be created
for each dataset that the publisher would like to make freely available
for review using Mnova software. To this end, the publisher must use
an RSA key pair: (i) the public key is sent to MestreLab to allow
them to generate a certificate file (.mncrt), which is then made available
to the publisher and (ii) the publisher uses their private RSA key
to “sign” the dataset, which generates a signature.
Overall, the mnpub file will be composed with the signature, the certification
file (mncrt) and a URL to the signed dataset (see example of mnpub
file).22 The process is simple and can
be executed with very little overhead by the publisher (see Supporting Information for further details).
The procedure can be fully automated as a part of the submission process
and will not require any additional input from the authors. For example,
as described in the last Section 2.3, the procedure can be implemented
in a data repository submission web service where the authors only
need to upload an mnova file or a zip file, with the mnpub file generated
automatically by the web service.

2.2.2 Reader’s
Perspective
The
reader can freely download Mnova software (a purchased license is
only needed for general use) and open the .mnpub file. This file will
be read by Mnova and verified with the public key information contained
in the mnpub file. If the verification is successful, the dataset
pointed by the URL field of the mnpub file will be retrieved for use
within Mnova with full functionality, without the need for a license.
The reader will be able to review, reprocess, and reanalyze the research
primary data, benefiting from all the functionality available within
the Mnova software package, albeit only for the digitally signed dataset.
This effectively makes such signed data open for review and reproduction
independently of access to licensed (in this example analytical chemistry)
software applications. The impact of such submission of primary research
data associated with articles is that it becomes available for detailed
review by a wide range of stakeholders such as article reviewers,
editors, data curators, publishers, peers, the general public and
artificial intelligence, and machine learning systems. Metadata associated
with the primary research data as generated by the original instrument
and then uploaded to the relevant repository also facilitates subsequent
automated or workflow machine processing of the data on as large an
aggregated scale as needed.

2.3 FAIR-Enabling
Mpublish Data23 by Deposition in a Data
Repository
Although the
Mpublish procedure provides an excellent mechanism for making complete
NMR data readily and appropriately available, the procedure also needs
to include mechanisms for ensuring it adheres as completely as possible
to the FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoperable,
and reusable).11 Indeed, enclosing the
data with the rich toolkit provided by Mnova addresses in large measure
the I of FAIR. The other attributes can be accomplished by deposition
into a data repository, a process that also includes generating metadata
and registering it appropriately to ensure standardized publication.
Here, we look at the steps taken to achieve this as implemented in
the Imperial College Mpublish pilot project.24,25

2.3.1 Data Granularity
The first task
is to decide upon appropriate granularity for the metadata. Mnova
files (generated from Mnova 11.0+ or using the automated Mpublish
workflow described above) can be generated for entire collections
of spectra in a single file containing many molecules, or they can
be restricted to just a single molecule, containing if necessary spectra
for different experiments and nuclei. We strongly favor the latter
approach, because metadata for single molecules can be generated far
more easily and transparently, and we believe also more usefully than
for molecule collections. This is largely based on the availability
of the InChI molecular identifier26 and
the possibility of generating it for a specific molecule using a simple
machine processable workflow procedure. We in fact apply it using
OpenBabel27 in which every file submitted
to the data repository is automatically screened by OpenBabel, and
if molecular content is identified, then both an InChI string and
an InChI key are generated from it.

In our recommendations,
every NMR spectrum submitted for deposition is accompanied by a suitable
molecular connection table in the form of standard files such as the
MDL molfile (.mol) or the ChemDraw .cdx or .cdxml files (Figure S5). This is essential if raw filesets
such as folder collections produced directly by instruments are submitted
(in the form of a compressed ZIP archive). Connection tables can also
be embedded in the Mnova files resulting from the primary processing
of such instrumental data, but currently, OpenBabel is not capable
of extracting such information from this format and hence in practice,
these too require separate inclusion of a molecule description file.
We suggest that the best practice is in fact to provide both the raw
instrument archive as a .zip archive (for reusers who choose to use
different software) together with the Mnova superset, which includes
both the FID and all analysis of the far more “user-friendly”
frequency domain spectrum (including solvent reference, annotations,
assignments, phase and baseline correction, etc.). Optionally, other
processed data formats such as the open standard JCAMP-DX or NMReData
noted above can also be provided for further interoperability and
even a visual format such as PDF to allow readers the option of access
to the traditional format currently found in most supporting information files.

2.3.2 Metadata
Further metadata is also
generated in a workflow manner (Figure S5), as implemented in the data repository.25 A minimal set would include the following:1. The ORCID identifier for the depositor
along with any further such identifiers for appropriate collaborators.
For the repository,28 we use ORCID as an
intrinsic part of the login process and so its inclusion in the metadata
records is automatic, as is the affiliation of the depositor.

2. The deposition date and
time are also
recorded automatically, together with the identity of the formal publisher
of the data, which can be the research institution as in the example
here.

3. A title and description
are recorded,
these being part of the Dublin Core metadata elements.29 Although these can have any value, we favor
including the systematic name of the molecule as part of the title
field and a brief description of the experimental procedures used
to prepare the compound in the description field.

4. We include a license for reuse and
if necessary, reanalysis, in our case the CC0 creative commons license,30 this directly addressing the R of FAIR.

5. A much less frequently
applied but
what we consider crucial metadata component is a declaration of a
so-called resource map enabling object reuse and exchange (ORE),31 which addresses the A of FAIR. This in turn
would allow any machine-driven automated procedures for retrieving
the data files on a scale larger than a human would adopt.

6. A media type is also declared
for specific
files in any uploaded fileset. For the Mpublish project, these include
chemical/x-mnova for the basic Mnova files and chemical/x-mnpub, which
is automatically generated using the cryptographic keys, which control
the single-use license on which Mpublish is based.



Once assembled, the metadata is then formulated against
the DataCite metadata schema (V 4.1).32 The metadata specific to the molecule is accommodated in the <subjects> element of the schema, an extensible
component
where subject-specific terms can be appropriately defined. An example
is shown in Figure 2 where the subjectScheme attribute is included to avoid clashes with
any other domains, which may accidentally use the same vocabulary.
In this example, an InChI identifier is included. To assist molecule
discovery, we normally include data for a single molecule so that
only one InChI identifier need be included and deprecate including
data for multiple different molecules in the same dataset.

Figure 2 <subject> element deriving from the DataCite
V 4.1 schema, populated with InChI metadata.

With this approach, control over the dictionary used in the <subject> element is highly desirable, because
uncontrolled
and undeclared extensions would inhibit the deployment of discovery
tools. To this end, a Data Interest Group in chemistry has been established
and regular meetings scheduled to promote communal agreement.33 The first proposal includes that shown in Figure 2. Other more NMR
specific extensions could in future include, for example, a richer
set of NMR-related metadata declaration, such the NMR nucleus studied,
the accepted name of any pulse sequence used in the experiment, solvent,
temperature, and so forth. Workflows specific to extract this information
automatically would also need to be developed. The repository used
to construct this demonstrator also supports the concept of hierarchical
collections, which serve to organize the data associated with a project
into subcollections. Subject element metadata for such top-level collections
would not normally be included if they contain no explicit molecule-based
datasets.

The DataCite registration API is then used to register
the metadata
with DataCite,34 a global aggregator of
such content. In return, DataCite responds with a persistent identifier
for the metadata taking the form of a Digital Object Identifier or
DOI. This is deliberately consistent with the DOI schemes used for
journal articles, allowing the development of synergies between the
two. The metadata itself can be downloaded as an XML file from the
landing page for any collection or dataset using a link, which includes
the DOI of the data: https://data.datacite.org/application/vnd.datacite.datacite+xml/10.14469/hpc/4751

If a more readily human-readable presentation is desired;
then,
the option of a style-based transform of this file is available. We
also anticipate text-based presentations of the metadata will become
available directly from the equivalent DataCite page, as invoked by: https://search.datacite.org/works?query=id:10.14469/hpc/4751

An example of early use of Mpublish deposition in a published
article18 illustrates how the article can
formally cite
the data (as references 3535 and 3618 in this case) and in turn how the article can
itself be cited via the metadata describing the data thus establishing
bidirectional linking.

2.3.3 Discovery and Findability
The final
aspect of FAIR-enabling the Mpublish data addresses F, the findability.
The registration of the metadata with DataCite allows the search interface
provided there to be used to discover data with the appropriate properties.
Machine processable examples are included below to illustrate this.1. https://search.datacite.org/works?query=media.media_type:chemical/x-mnpub* uses the media type declaration to discover all datasets registered
with this type.

2. https://search.datacite.org/works?query=media.media_type:chemical/x-mnpub*+AND+subjects.subjectScheme:inchikey+AND+subjects.subject:XZYDALXOGPZGNV-UHFFFAOYSA-M+AND+media.media_type:chemical/x-gaussian* shows how the media type can be combined with two Boolean AND operations
to restrict the search to datasets where a specified InChIKey has
also been registered and is also accompanied by a Gaussian computation
output. This search only specifies that both media types must be present
in the fileset but not necessarily that the two are related.

3. https://search.datacite.org/works?query=contributors.nameIdentifiers.nameIdentifier:*0000-0002-8635-8390+AND+media.media_type:chemical/x-mnpub* illustrates how the search can be combined with a restriction to
those Mpublish datasets associated with a specific researcher as defined
by their ORCID.

4. We note
that the above syntax is not
human-friendly and hence the need for development of more accessible
forms of the search interface that can take advantage of these rich
searches.

5. https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?search_text=10.14469 allows the discovery of datasets assigned the DOI prefix (Imperial
College) linked to journal publications registered with the Crossref
metadata store, as one example of the synergies noted above.



The inclusion of an ORE resource map in
the collected
metadata allows the results of a search of the above type to then
be scripted to allow direct retrieval of specific files on as large
a scale as necessary. It is important to note that knowing just the
DOI of any published fileset does not automatically enable this, a
DOI normally points to what is called a landing page from which further
parochial navigation is required to allow access to individual files
is needed. Normally, a human performs this navigation (because it
is rarely standard in any predictable sense), but with data, it is
essential to have a formal declaration that a machine can traverse
automatically. Thus, the A of FAIR ideally relates both to visual
access by a human and also to applications such as data mining by
machines. One example18 of the use of an
ORE map to automatically retrieve and display data based only on knowledge
of the DOI and the desired media type is based on the JSmol molecular
visualizer. Such a feature could in principle also be developed for
more specific spectroscopic tools such as Mnova.

2.3.4 FAIR Compliance.
FAIR compliance
can be evaluated using an objective, automated, and community-governed
framework.36 The evaluation37 for the repository used here25 is based on the features described above. We recommend
that any repository providing access to FAIR-enabled data such as
described here should be submitted to such an evaluation.

3 Conclusions
The Mpublish tools available
within the Mnova NMR analysis program
allow the workflow generation of publication-ready supporting information (SI) files, which can be submitted
to a publisher and/or a data repository. Both the original primary/raw
data and the generated SI files can be
integrated with cryptographic license keys to allow access to individual
datafiles without the requirement of first obtaining full commercial
licenses. Further workflows can be used to generate a set of standardized
metadata describing the datasets. The registration of such metadata
with a global aggregating agency such as DataCite in return for association
with a persistent identifier (a DOI) can transform the data into a
rich resource where all four attributes of FAIR data are at least
partially addressed. These include the provenance of the data and
unique descriptors of the molecule associated with the spectra to
enhance findability via rich searches of the indexed metadata. A metadata
resource map allows rich (machine) access, a toolkit facilitates interoperability,
information is included in the metadata about any associated data
relating to other aspects such as computational simulations and models
and an appropriately declared license facilitates reuse. We suggest
this model for spectroscopic publication could serve as a starting
point for extension to many other forms of molecular spectroscopy
and instrumentally generated primary or raw data.

Although ideally
FAIR data might imply software agnostic and software
independent tools, realistically the generation of FAIR data must
take into account tools available now for researchers to prepare and
publish research data. The methods described above do not purport
to be a complete solution, they are merely an attempt to suggest some
usable tools that can achieve the goals of FAIR data now for a specific
type of data and to describe an approach, which could be extended
to other types of data by other researchers in related domains.
