With
the aim of revealing the catalytic role of atypically coordinated
(3His-1Glu) active site mononuclear non-heme Fe(II)-dependent quercetin
2,4-dioxygenase (Fe-2,4-QD) and the electronic effects of the model
ligands on the reactivity toward dioxygen, a set of p/m-R-substituted
carboxylate-containing ligand-supported Fe(II)-3-hydroxyflavonolate
complexes, [FeIILR(fla)] (LRH: 2-{[bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino]methyl}-p/m-R-benzoic acid; R: p-OMe (1), p-Me (2), m-Br (4), and m-NO2 (5); fla: 3-hydroxyflavonolate), were synthesized and
characterized as structural and functional models for the ES (enzyme–substrate)
complexes of Fe-2,4-QD. [FeIILR(fla)] show relatively
high enzyme-type reactivity (dioxygenative ring opening of the coordinated
substrate fla, single-turnover reaction) at low temperatures (30–65
°C). The reaction shows a linear Hammett plot (ρ = −1.21),
and electron donating groups enhance the reaction rates. The notable
difference on the reactivity can be rationalized from the electronic
nature of the substituent in the ligands, which could tune the reactivity
via tuning Lewis acidity of the Fe(II) ion, electron density, and
the redox potential of fla. The properties and the reactivity show
approximately linear correlations between λmax or E1/2 of fla and the reaction rate constant k. This work sheds light not only on understanding of electronic
effects of the ligands and the property–reactivity relationship
but also on the role of the catalytic reaction by Fe-2,4-QD.

Introduction
Mononuclear non-heme
Fe(II)-dependent enzymes (MNHEs) act pivotal
roles in the O2 metabolism, catalyze an amazing variety
of oxidative reactions, and have potential medical and pharmaceutical
applications.1 Generally, the Fe(II) ion
in the active sites of MNHEs is coordinated by two histidine imidazoles
and a carboxylate group of Glu or Asp in a “facial triad”
mode. However, atypical coordination modes, such as the three histidine
imidazoles 3His mode [as observed in diketone dioxygenase (Dke1)2 and cysteine dioxygenase (CDO)3], or three histidine imidazoles and a carboxylate 3His-1Glu
mode [as observed in acireductone dioxygenase (ARD)4 and quercetin 2,4-dioxygenase (2,4-QD)5], were also reported recently. The active site structure–function
relationship of different active site MNHEs is very interesting and
fascinating. Compared with the well-studied typically coordinated
MNHEs, biomimetic research of the atypically coordinated MNHEs, especially
those bearing the 3His-1Glu mode and the structure–function
relationship of different active site MNHEs, remains largely undeveloped.

In the initial step of the quercetin catabolism, 2,4-QD activates
dioxygen to catalyze the oxygenative O-heterocycle
ring opening reaction of flavonoid quercetin (3′,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavonol,
QUE) to the corresponding phenolic carboxylic acid esters and release
carbon monoxide (Scheme 1).6

Scheme 1 Reaction of QUE with Dioxygen Catalyzed
by 2,4-QD
The fungal 2,4-QD7−9 is the only known Cu(II)-dependent dioxygenase (Cu-2,4-QD)
and has a mononuclear type II Cu(II) reaction center. The active site
of 2,4-QD from Aspergillus japonicas comprises two distinct coordination environments. In the first case,
the Cu(II) is coordinated by a carboxylate group of Glu73, three histidine
imidazoles, and one water molecule to form a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal
geometry, whereas another exhibits a distorted tetrahedral geometry
without the binding of Glu73.7 In the enzyme–substrate
(ES) complex, the Cu(II) active site shows a distorted square pyramidal
geometry, in which a deprotonated substrate 3-hydroxyflavonolate (fla)
is bound to Cu(II) via the 3-hydroxy group with the displacement of
the water molecule.10 The mutation of Glu73
induces a loss of enzyme activity,7 implying
that the Glu73 carboxylate group acts an essential catalytic role.10

The bacterial 2,4-QD from Bacillus subtilis(5,11,12) is an FeII-dependent dioxygenase (Fe-2,4-QD).
It has an atypically coordinated
mononuclear non-heme Fe(II) active site, which also exhibits two distinct
structures similar to that of Cu-2,4-QD.5 In the N- or C-terminal cupin motif, the Fe(II) active site shows
a distorted trigonal bipyramidal or a square pyramidal geometry involving
three histidine imidazoles, a water molecule, and one Glu69 (2.10
Å) or Glu241 (2.44 Å, weakly coordinated).5

So far, a lot of Cu-2,4-QD models have been reported,13−16 though other metal-based models, especially those containing iron,
are still rare,16e,17–24 Currently, only five structurally characterized Fe–fla complexes—[FeIII(fla)(L1)]ClO4 (L1: N-propanoate-N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine)
(Figure 1a),17 [FeIII(4′-MeOfla)3],18 [FeIII(fla)(salen)] (salenH2: 1,6-bis-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2,5-diaza-hexa-1,5-diene) (Figure 1b),19 [FeIII(fla)2Cl(MeOH)],20 and [FeIILH(fla)] (LHH: 2-{[bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino]methyl}benzoic acid) (Figure 1d)21a—have been reported, though their oxidation states
are not the same as that in the ES adduct of the FeII-2,4-QD
except [FeIILH(fla)]. There are only three examples
of Fe(II)–fla complexes to mimic FeII-2,4-QD: [FeII(fla)(L1)],17 [(6-Ph2TPA)FeII(fla)]ClO4 (6-Ph2TPA: N,N-bis((6-phenyl-2-pyridyl)methyl)-N-((2-pyridyl)methyl)amine) (Figure 1c),22 and [FeIILH(fla)].21a However,
[FeII(fla)(L1)]17 and [(6-Ph2TPA)FeII(fla)]ClO422 are not crystallographically characterized,
and the reactivity of [FeII(fla)(L1)]17 toward dioxygen is lower and requires higher
temperatures (65–80 °C) relative to [FeIILH(fla)]. Besides, [(6-Ph2TPA)FeII(fla)]ClO4 reacts with O2 to give a diiron(III) μ-oxo
complex [(6-Ph2TPAFeIII(fla))2(μ-O)](ClO4)2.22 No enzyme-type
dioxygenation reactivity study has been done for this complex. Thus,
[FeIILH(fla)] is the only crystallographically
characterized FeII–fla complex with a higher enzyme-type
dioxygenation reactivity reported previously by our group.21a

model complexes.
(d) Structures of the model complexes (M: Fe) in this work.

Most of the reported 2,4-QD model
complexes are supported by polyamine
ligands. The role of the active site carboxylate group of Glu of the
enzyme has not received much attention, and little attempts have been
made to design carboxylate-containing ligands. Up to now, there are
only three types of carboxylate-containing ligand-supported ES model
complexes of 2,4-QD. They are [MII(fla)(L1)]
(M: Mn, FeII/III, Co, Ni, Cu),17 [MIILR(fla)] (M: Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn; LRH: 2-{[bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino]methyl}-p/m-R-benzoic acid; R: p-OMe, p-Me, -H, m-Br, and m-NO2) (Figure 1d),21,23,24 and [CuIILn(fla)] (L1/2H: 2/3-((bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino)methyl)benzoic
acid; L3/4H: 2/3-((bis(2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)amino)methyl)benzoic
acid).21a,25

Generally, the active site residues
of the enzyme and their substituent
groups, with the aid from the second coordination sphere, are important
factors to stabilize the intermediates, tune the catalytic activity,
and the conformation of the enzyme via influencing the coordination
geometry of the metal cofactor. There are some reports about the biomimetic
studies that focus on the electronic substituent effects of the substrate
fla on the reactivity.13−16,19,26,27 However, as we know, there are only two
reports that focus on the electronic effects of the substituent group
of the model ligands of Co(II) and Ni(II) ES model complexes on their
reactivities.23,24 No report focused on the electronic
effects of the substituent group in the model ligands of Fe(II) ES
model complexes on their reactivities has been published yet.

With an aim to investigate the electronic substituent effects of
the model ligands on the chemical functions of Fe-2,4-QD and the active
site structure–function relationship of different active site
MNHEs, we synthesized and characterized a set of structural and functional
FeII–fla ES model complexes [FeIILR(fla)] (R: p-OMe (1), p-Me (2), m-Br (4), and m-NO2 (5)) (Figure 1d) ([FeIILH(fla)] (3) has already been reported in
our previous paper21a) of Fe-2,4-QD using p/m-substituted carboxylate-containing
ligands. A detailed investigation on their structures, physicochemical
properties, electrochemical properties, and dioxygenation reactivity
is presented.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Structural
Characterization
The ligands
LRH (Figure 1d) were synthesized based on the reported methods.23 The reaction of FeII(OAc)2 with the
neutral ligand LRH and flavonol (flaH) under N2 gave the corresponding complexes [FeIILR(fla)]
(R: p-OMe (1), p-Me
(2), m-Br (4), and m-NO2 (5)). No additional base was
added during the reaction, and the acetate ions (AcO–) were proposed to act as proton acceptors. All complexes are relatively
stable under air in the solid state, but very sensitive to air in
solution (see below). Thus, their single crystals suitable for X-ray
crystallographic analysis cannot be obtained successfully. Only a
single crystal of one of the oxidized dioxygenation products, salicylate
(sal) complex [FeIIILOMe(sal)]·H2O (1′), was obtained during recrystallization
of [FeIILOMe(fla)] (1) by slow
diffusion of ether into the dichloromethane solution of 1 without N2 protection at room temperature. The structure
is shown in Figure 2. The crystallographic data and the selected bond lengths and angles
are summarized in Tables S1 and S2, respectively.

Figure 2 ORTEP
(50% ellipsoid) representation of [FeIIILOMe(sal)]·H2O (1′). For
clarity, hydrogen atoms and free solvent molecules are omitted.

1′ crystallizes
in the monoclinic P2(1)/n space
group. It has a mononuclear structure,
and the FeIII ion is coordinated by O(4) (carboxylate)
and O(6) (2-hydroxylate) of sal, O(1) (benzoate) of LOMe, and three nitrogen atoms of LOMe to form a distorted
octahedral geometry. The axial positions are occupied by O(6) and
N(3) atoms (amine nitrogen atom).

The bond lengths of Fe–O(1)
(benzoate of LOMe) is 1.940(3) Å, which is shorter
than those of the resting
FeII-2,4-QD (2.10 Å)5 and
the nonsubstituted derivative [FeIILH(fla)]
(2.0256(18) Å)21a but close to that
of [FeIII(fla)(L1)]ClO4 (1.909(5)
Å).17 The bond lengths of Fe–O(4)
and Fe–O(6) (oxygen atoms of salicylate) are 1.962(3) and 1.878(3)
Å, respectively. The average Fe–O bond length is 1.93
Å, which is similar to that of [FeIII(fla)(L1)]ClO4 (1.97 Å).17 The
average Fe–N bond length is 2.16 Å, which is also close
to those of [FeIII(fla)(L1)]ClO4 (2.15
Å)17 and [(6-Ph2TPAFeIII(fla))2(μ-O)](ClO4)2 (2.21 Å)22 but shorter than those
of native Fe-2,4-QD (2.26 Å)5 and
[FeIILH(fla)] (2.23 Å).21a Both the color and the charge balance indicate that the
Fe ion is +3 state, as also proved also by BVS (bond valence sum)
calculation (2.89).28

The eventually
produced crystals of the enzyme-type dioxygenation
reaction product sal complex [FeIIILOMe(sal)]·H2O (1′) during recrystallization of [FeIILOMe(fla)] (1) without N2 protection at room temperature are likely an indication that [FeIILOMe(fla)] (1) very easily reacts
with O2 even under air at room temperature, which is consistent
with its high enzyme-type reactivity (see below).

Although suitable
single crystals of [FeIILR(fla)] cannot be obtained,
they are proposed to have a mononuclear
structure bearing a distorted octahedral geometry, similar to that
of the nonsubstituted derivative [FeIILH(fla)],21a as proved by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR), ESI-MS, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic
results that will be depicted below.

Spectroscopic and Redox
Properties of the Complexes
Infrared Spectroscopy
The FT-IR
spectra of both solid
and ethanol solution state samples of the complexes were measured
(Table 1, Supporting Information, Table S3 and Figure S1).
As a typical example, the FT-IR spectra of 1 in both
states are shown in Figure S1. The spectra
between the ethanol solution and solid state samples of each complex
are quite similar, suggesting that all complexes keep their monomeric
structure [FeIILR(fla)] in solution, which coincides
with ESI-MS and EPR results (see below). The ν(C=O) (C=O
stretching vibration) of the bound carbonyl group of fla appears around
1550 cm–1 (ca. 50 cm–1 red-shifted
compared with free flavonol (1602 cm–1)), which
is close to those of reported fla complexes.13−16,26 In both states, each complex displays the asymmetric νas(COO–) and symmetric νs(COO–) stretching frequencies of the carboxylate
group of LR around 1615 and 1420 cm–1, respectively. The difference Δν between νas(COO–) and νs(COO–) is in the range of 190–200 cm–1, which is a clear evidence to prove that the carboxylate group of
ligand in all complexes has a monodentate coordination mode in both
states.29

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
All complexes
display an
intense π → π* transition band of the coordinated
fla30 in dimethylformamide (DMF) around
400 nm [400 nm (ε = 9.59 × 103 M–1 cm–1) for 1, 399 nm (ε = 1.03
× 104 M–1 cm–1) for 2, 396 nm (ε = 1.16 × 104 M–1 cm–1) for 4, and 394 nm (ε = 1.03 × 104 M–1 cm–1) for 5] (Figure 3a and Table 1). The λmax values are comparable
with that of [FeIILH(fla)] (3)
(398 nm)21a but blue-shifted 2–17
nm than those of models [FeII(fla)(L1)] (402
nm),17 [FeIII(4′-MeOfla)3] (411 nm),18 [FeIII(fla)(salen)] (407 nm),19 and [(6-Ph2TPA)FeII(fla)]ClO4 (415 nm),22 which could be explained by a combination effect
of the carboxylate negative charge in the model ligands and a lower
charge of the Fe(II) versus Fe(III) ion. Compared with free fla (458
nm for Me4Nfla22 and 465 nm
for Kfla31), all λmax values
are blue-shifted (ca. 60 nm), which are similar to those of the enzymatic5,10,12 and other synthetic model systems.13−27

Besides, an order of −OMe
(1) > −Me
(2) > −H (3)21a > −Br (4) > −NO2 (5) was observed for the λmax values
of fla
in the complexes, which correlates linearly with the Hammett constants
σ of the substituent groups of the ligands (R = 0.99) (Figure 3b). The stronger electron donating groups induce less blue shift
(lower energy) of the λmax values of fla. These results
demonstrate that the λmax values of fla are influenced
by the substituent groups in the ligands through the benzoate, Fe(II),
and “charge delocalization conduit”, as indicated by
wine-red color in Scheme 2.7,23,24 All complexes
also show an absorption shoulder around 485 nm, which is probably
due to the charge transfer between Fe(II) and ligand and an intense
absorption band around 280 nm from the supporting model ligand.

Scheme 2 Dioxygenation Reaction Products of [FeIILR(fla)]
in DMF
ESI-MS Spectroscopy
Because [FeIILR(fla)] was quite sensitive to
air in solution, we observed only a
peak cluster attributable to the oxidized species [FeIIILR(fla)]+ as a main peak at m/z (pos.) = 655.1 for 1, 639.3 for 2, 703.2 for 4, and 670.3 for 5 (Figure 4). Furthermore, no
oxo- or fla-bridged dimeric species were observed.

Figure 4 ESI-MS spectra of (a)
[FeIILOMe(fla)] (1), (b) [FeIILMe(fla)] (2), (c) [FeIILBr(fla)] (4), and
(d) [FeIILNO2(fla)] (5) in CH3OH (samples were prepared in a glove box but measured
under air). Insets: Experimental and calculated isotope patterns of
the species [FeIIILR(fla)]+ (line:
experimental; column: calculated).

The very good agreement of the m/z values and the isotope distribution patterns of the peak
clusters
between the experimental and calculated data strongly suggest that
[FeIILR(fla)] is easily auto-oxidized to [FeIIILR(fla)]+ by air but keep their monomer
structures even after auto-oxidation in solution, which are in line
with the results of the solution obtained using FT-IR and EPR (see
below).

EPR Spectroscopy
The X-band EPR spectra of the complexes
[FeIILR(fla)] were all silent under N2 at 100 K (Figure 5A, black line spectra), indicating that the valence of the iron ion
is +2. The results resemble that of native Fe-2,4-QD.5,11,12

(d) [FeIILNO2(fla)] (5). Line (A): under N2, (B): exposed to air 2 min, and
(C): after the reaction with O2.

Cyclic Voltammetry
The results of cyclic voltammetry
(CV) of [FeIILR(fla)] are summarized in Table 1. All redox potentials
are reported versus SCE. The cyclic voltammogram of 1 is shown in Figure 6a as a typical example. All complexes display a quasireversible redox
couple attributable to the one-electron redox process between FeII and FeIII with E1/2 = −0.114 V for [FeIILOMe(fla)] (1), −0.098 V for [FeIILMe(fla)]
(2), −0.049 V for [FeIILBr(fla)] (4), and −0.029 V for [FeIILNO2(fla)] (5). The E1/2 values are comparable with that of [FeIILH(fla)] (3) (E1/2 = −0.094 V).21a An order of −OMe
(1) < −Me (2) < −H (3)21a < −Br (4) < −NO2 (5) was observed for the E1/2 values of FeIII/II of the complexes.
Besides, the values also correlate linearly with Hammett constants
σ (R = 0.98) (Figure 6c). Obviously, the order can be explained
by stronger electron-donating groups that induce higher electron density
on the Fe(II) ion, thus leading to easier oxidation of the Fe(II)
ion.

(b) under a slightly aerobic condition. (c) Plot of E1/2 of FeIII/II vs σ. (d) Plot of E1/2 of fla/fla• vs σ.

Intriguingly, when the solution
of [FeIILR(fla)] in DMF was made to contact
with air slowly, a new quasireversible
redox couple arose at E1/2 = +0.120 V
for [FeIILOMe(fla)] (1) (Figure 6b), +0.126 V for
[FeIILMe(fla)] (2), +0.216 V for
[FeIILBr(fla)] (4), and +0.231
V for [FeIILNO2(fla)] (5), then vanished slowly. Under anaerobic conditions, this redox couple
was not observed. The redox couple emerged during the slow reaction
with O2 can be assigned to the one-electron redox process
between fla and flavonoxy radical fla•.21a The E1/2 values
of fla/fla• redox couples are comparable with that
of [FeIILH(fla)] (3) (E1/2 = +0.130 V)21a and exhibit
remarkable differences among them. Besides, an order of −OMe
(1) < −Me (2) < −H (3)21a < −Br (4) < −NO2 (5) was observed, and
the E1/2 values are also correlate the
linear relationship with Hammett constants σ (R = 0.92) (Figure 6d). The order implies that the bound fla is more readily oxidized
in the order of −OMe (1) > −Me (2) > −H (3)21a > −Br
(4) > −NO2 (5), as
also
confirmed by experiments (see below). The order of E1/2 of fla/fla• can be ascribed to the
electronic nature of the substituent in the ligands, which could tune
the redox potential of fla via tuning Lewis acidity of the Fe(II)
ion and the electron density of fla. The stronger electron donating
group, the weaker Lewis acidity of the Fe(II) ion, the weaker interaction
between the Fe(II) ion and fla, the larger electron density on the
fla moiety, the lower redox potentials of fla, and the easier oxidation
of the bound fla.

Reaction with Dioxygen (Enzyme-Type Dioxygenation
Reactivity)
Aerobic treatment of [FeIILR(fla)] in DMF
at 70 °C for 8 h gave the primary products O-benzoylsalicylic acid (HObs) [m/z (pos.): 243.1 (M + H)+] (2.4–17%) and CO (over
64% for 1); then, HObs was hydrolyzed to produce salicylic
acid [m/z (neg.): 137.1 (M –
H)−] (81–97%) and benzoic acid [m/z (neg.): 121.1 (M – H)−] (67–82%) by a small amount of water presented in the solvent.
The benzoic acid was further converted to an amide derivative, N,N-dimethylbenzamide [m/z (pos.): 150.1 (M + H)+] (10–16%)
(Scheme 2) by the solvent
DMF. These products were identified by LC–MS (Figure S2) and 1H NMR21a and summarized in Table S4. Conversions
of the complexes are over 99%. As the products of the oxygenative
ring opening reaction of the bound fla are similar to that catalyzed
by the native enzyme, [FeIILR(fla)] display
an enzyme-type reactivity.

The dioxygenation reaction processes
of the bound fla of [FeIILR(fla)] were followed
by monitoring the absorption change ca. 400 nm band in DMF at 30–65
°C. The kinetic data, activation parameters, and reaction conditions
are summarized in Tables 2 and S5. As a typical example,
the time-dependent absorption spectral change and time trace during
the dioxygenation reaction of [FeIILOMe(fla)]
(1) are shown in Figure 7a. The initial reaction rate (vint, M s–1) was calculated from the initial
straight line part of the plot of ΔA versus
time (Figure 7a, inset). Figure 7b,c show that the vint correlates linearly with the initial concentrations
of both [FeIILR(fla)]0 and [O2]0, thus, vint = k[FeIILR(fla)][O2]. The
second-order rate constants k were calculated through
dividing vint by both [FeIILR(fla)]0 and [O2]0.

Therefore,
the apparent second-order reaction rate constants k were calculated to be 8.71–150 × 10–2 M–1 s–1 at 50 °C (ΔH⧧ = 59–67 kJ mol–1, ΔS⧧ = −57 to −64
J mol–1 K–1) (Table 2, Supporting Information, Table S5 and Figure S3). Till now, only two examples
of Fe(II)–fla complexes [FeII(fla)(L1)]17 and [FeIILH(fla)] (3) (39.8 × 10–2 M–1 s–1 at 50 °C and 179 ×
10–2 M–1 s–1 at 70 °C)21a showing a dioxygenation
reactivity have been reported. [FeII(fla)(L1)] is not structurally characterized and exhibits a relatively lower
reactivity (only 58.6 × 10–2 M–1 s–1 even at 80 °C) and requires a higher
temperature (65–80 °C).17 Compared
to it, our model complexes [FeIILR(fla)] show
a higher enzyme-type reactivity at a lower temperature (30–65
°C), which could be rationalized by the electron donation effect
of the substituted benzoate group in the ligand. These results further
demonstrate that our model complexes are good functional models of
Fe-2,4-QD.

It is noteworthy that the dioxygenation reactivity
of [FeIILR(fla)] shows a great difference and
follows a substituent
dependent ranking, −OMe (1) > −Me (2) > −H (3)21a > −Br (4) > −NO2 (5) (Figure 7, Table 2). The Hammett
plot
is linear, and the reaction constant is ρ = −1.21 (R = 0.89) (Figure 7d), implying that the electron donating groups quicken the
reaction rates remarkably. The notable difference on the dioxygenation
reactivity could be rationalized by the electronic nature of the substituent
in the ligand, which could tune the reactivity through varying the
electron density of fla via the benzoate, Fe(II) ion, and “charge
delocalization conduit”. Namely, the stronger electron donation
to the Fe(II) ion by the electron donating group via the benzoate
group makes Lewis acidity of the Fe(II) ion weaker; thus, the electron
density on the fla moiety in the complexes is larger and the redox
potential of fla is lower, so the fla moiety can be oxidized easier
by O2.

It should be pointed out that the order of
dioxygenation reactivity
looks to be in line with the order of λmax but inverse
of the order of the redox potential E1/2 (fla/fla•) in the complexes, and they all correlate
with Hammett constants σ linearly. Thus, the plots of k versus λmax and E1/2 (fla/fla•) gave an approximately linear
correlation as shown in Figure 7e (R = 0.60) and 7f (R = 0.37). These results imply that the properties
and the reactivities of [FeIILR(fla)] were affected
by the electronic nature of the substituent in the ligand through
the benzoate, Fe(II) ion, and “charge delocalization conduit”,
and there are some relationships among them. The stronger the electron-donating
group in the ligand, the lower the energy of the π →
π* transition, the lower the redox potential of fla, and the
higher the dioxygenation reactivity. As the first example of a set
of structural and functional ES models of atypically coordinated 3His-1Glu
active site mononuclear non-heme FeII-dependent Fe-2,4-QD,
which focus on the electronic effects of the ligand on the enzyme-type
reactivity; this study will supply critical insights into the role
of Fe-2,4-QD and their property–reactivity relationship.

Dioxygenation Reaction Mechanism
As mentioned above,
when the ESI-MS spectra of [FeIILR(fla)] were
recorded under the air, we only observed a peak cluster assignable
to the oxidized species [FeIIILR(fla)]+ as a main peak (Table 1 and Figure 4). After
the EPR samples of the [FeIILR(fla)] solution
were exposed to air for 2 min at room temperature, we observed a typical
mononuclear Fe(III) EPR signal around g = 4.3 (Figure 5B, red line spectra).
Ca. 10% Fe(II) ions were converted to Fe(III) (according to the g = 4.3 signal height). All these results demonstrate that
the Fe(II) ions in [FeIILR(fla)] were very easily
oxidized to Fe(III) by O2 to form the Fe(III)–fla
species [FeIIILR(fla)]+ (A) and superoxide radical O2•– first. The O2•– was verified by
NBT2+ (nitroblue tetrazolium) and DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) methods. A new monoformazan (MF+, the
reduction product of NBT2+) absorption band rose at 530
nm (Figure 8a, red
line spectra for 1) when excess NBT2+ was
added to a [FeIILR(fla)] solution (0.5 mM in
DMF) under O2.32 Notably, when
a solution of [FeIILR(fla)] (4 mM) and 2 equiv
DMPO in DMF was exposed to air at room temperature, an EPR signal
of DMPO–OOH appeared at g = 2.0069 (a = 12 G). As a typical example, the EPR spectrum of 1 with DMPO under air is shown in Figure 8b.

Figure 8 (a) Spectral change of [FeIILOMe(fla)] (1) (0.5 mM in DMF) in the presence
of excess NBT under O2 (red line) and N2 (black
line) at room temperature.
(b) EPR spectrum of 1 in the presence of 2 equiv DMPO
under air at room temperature.

After the dioxygenation reaction, a peak cluster assignable
to
the enzyme-type reaction products salicylate (sal) or benzoate (ben)
complexes was observed at m/z (pos.)
= 556.4 ([FeIIILOMe(sal)]H+) for 1, 645.1 ([FeIIILMe(ben)2]H+) for 2, 604.2 ([FeIIILBr(sal)]H+) for 4, and 571.1 ([FeIIILNO2(sal)]H+) for 5 in the ESI-MS spectra. On the other hand, EPR signals assignable
to typical mononuclear Fe(III) appeared around g =
7.66, 4.27, and 2.06 (Figure 5C, blue line spectra).

In the light of all experimental
results, a possible dioxygenation
reaction mechanism was proposed and shown in Scheme 3. First, [FeIILR(fla)]
and one O2 molecule react quickly to form [FeIIILR(fla)]+ (A) and O2•–. Then, there are two possible pathways from A in the
next step. One pathway a: direct reaction of intermediate A with another O2 molecule to form an endoperoxide intermediate
[FeIIIL(fla–O2)]+ (B) slowly. Another pathway b: the reaction of A with
another O2 molecule through an electron transfer process
from fla to O2 to produce flavonoxy radical species [FeIIILR(fla•)]2+ (C) and another O2•– slowly. There are also two possible pathways
from C in the next step. One pathway c: the O2•– attacks the fla• moiety in C to generate
an alkylperoxide adduct D. Then, an intramolecular cyclization
reaction takes place and an endoperoxide intermediate B is formed. Another pathway d: a FeIII-superoxide adduct E is formed by the coordination of O2•– to FeIII in C. Then, a Fe(III)–alkylperoxide intermediate F is produced by the intramolecular radical coupling. From F the same endoperoxide intermediate B can also
be generated. Once B is formed, the dioxygenated products
complex [FeIIILR(Obs)]+ (G) is engendered by releasing CO. No direct evidence is available
to conclude the accurate reaction pathways, path a or path b and path
c or path d at this moment. However, the observed redox couple of
fla/fla•, the reduction of NBT2+, and
DMPO–OOH EPR signals mentioned above may support the reaction
pathway b and pathway d, which involves a flavonoxy radical species,
intermediate C and FeIII–OO•– species E, respectively. Nevertheless, the possibility
of pathway a also could not be excluded. The reaction mechanism of
all the complexes are the same and also close to those of the nonsubstituted
derivative [FeIILH(fla)] (3)21a and Fe-2,4-QD.5,11,12

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have successfully synthesized and characterized
a set of structural and functional ES models of Fe-2,4-QD, [FeIILR(fla)] based on p/m-R-substituted carboxylate-containing ligands (R: p-OMe (1), p-Me (2), m-Br (4), and m-NO2 (5)). The model complexes exhibit a relatively high
enzyme-type dioxygenation reactivity at low temperature. The dioxygenation
reactions display first-order dependence versus both initial concentrations
of the complexes and dioxygen. In addition, the reactivity is varied
notably with the substituent group R and follows the ranking of −OMe
(1) > −Me (2) > −H (3)21a > −Br (4) > −NO2 (5). The Hammett plot
shows
a linear relationship (ρ = −1.21), and electron donating
groups progress the reaction rates. The electronic nature of the substituent
in the ligand tunes the properties and the reactivity of the complexes
remarkably, and there are some correlations between k with the λmax of the π → π*
transition or the redox potential of the fla moiety in the complexes,
respectively. That is to say, the key role of the substituent group
is to tune Lewis acidity of Fe(II), the electron density, and the
redox potential of fla by electron donation via benzoate, Fe(II) ion,
and “charge delocalization conduit”. As far as we know,
this is the first example of a set of the ES models of Fe-2,4-QD,
which faithfully reproduce the atypically coordinated 3His-1Glu coordination
environment of the mononuclear non-heme FeII-dependent
Fe-2,4-QD active site structurally and functionally and will provide
crucial insights into the role of Fe-2,4-QD and the active site structure–function
relationship of different active site MNHEs.

Synthesis of the Model Complexes [FeIILR(fla)]
Ligands LRH (R: p-OMe, p-Me, m-Br, m-NO2) were synthesized based on the reported
methods.23 Complexes were synthesized using
a similar method. A solution
of LRH (0.1 mmol in 1.0 mL dry CH3OH) was added
dropwise to a solution of FeII(OAc)2 (17.4 mg,
0.1 mmol, in 2.0 mL dry CH3OH) under a nitrogen atmosphere
at room temperature. After stirring for 30 min, a solution of flavonol
(23.8 mg, 0.1 mmol, in 1:1 CH3OH/CH2Cl2) was added dropwise to the above solution with strong stirring.
The mixture was stirred for 1 day under N2. The [FeIILR(fla)] was isolated as dark red powder by filtration.
