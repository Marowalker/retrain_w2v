The bifunctional catalytic efficacy
of alumina-supported gold nanoparticles
(Au/Al2O3) was investigated for the synthesis
of a series of 2-amino-3-aryl-imidazopyridines through the chemoselective
reduction of the corresponding 2-nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in high isolated yields. This highly efficient
protocol was initially applied for the synthesis of 2-nitro-3-aryl
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines via the reaction between
2-aminopyridine and nitroalkenes catalyzed by the present catalytic
system Au/Al2O3. Moreover, the heterogeneous
surface γ-Al2O3 was also found to catalyze
this pathway in a comparable manner. However, only Au/Al2O3 was further proved as the appropriate catalytic system
for the selective transfer hydrogenation of the synthesized 2-nitro
imidazopyridine derivatives into the corresponding 2-amino-3-aryl
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines using NaBH4 as
a hydrogen-donor molecule. In addition, the one-pot two-step reaction
between nitroalkenes and aminopyridines in the presence of Au/Al2O3–NaBH4 provided directly the
fast and facile synthesis of 2-amino-3-aryl imidazopyridines, highlighting
a useful synthetic application of the catalytic protocol.

Introduction
The imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine core is one of the
most important class of biologically active nitrogen-containing heterocyclic
molecules that display a wide range of applications in drug synthesis,
medicinal chemistry, and materials science.1 Therefore, significant synthetic strategies have been directed toward
the preparation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives,
such as condensation, multicomponent, intramolecular cyclization,
tandem reactions, and oxidative couplings, using 2-amino pyridines
as key precursors.2−6 Beyond the most common synthetic approaches starting with diketones
or enones and 2-amino pyridine, the condensation between the latter
and nitroalkenes have received significant attention in the last years.7−18 On the basis of this reaction, numerous synthetic procedures have
been proposed for the synthesis of 3-nitro imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives; however, studies on the synthesis of the corresponding
regioisomers 2-nitro imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines are
limited.19−21 In specific, the Fe(NO3)3-catalyzed
C–H amination under ambient air has been initially proposed
(Scheme 1, i);19 moreover, an alternative visible-light-assisted
process using eosin Y as the photocatalyst under an open atmosphere
has also been developed (Scheme 1, ii).20 Recently, metal–organic
framework MIL68 has been proposed as the first heterogeneous catalyst
for the synthesis of 2-nitro-3-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
via the oxidative amination of 2-aminopyridines and nitroalkenes using
air as oxidant; however, the presence of formic acid as a co-catalyst
is required to accelerate this transformation (Scheme 1, iii).21

Scheme 1 Synthetic Approaches for the Synthesis of 2-Nitro- and 2-Amino-3-aryl
Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
Together with the nitro derivatives, the amino-substituted
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines represent an important core
of molecules with
high biological and medicinal properties. In particular, imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives bearing amino groups in the 2-position
of the imidazole ring exhibit potent anticancer and antiviral activities,22−26 as well as are valuable building blocks in drug discovery.27−29 Although several approaches provide access to the 3-amino substituted
derivatives,30−37 synthetic pathways for 2-amino-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
have been rarely reported in the literature. So far, Hamdouchi et
al.38−40 described the synthesis of substituted 6-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl)imidazopyridines
via the subsequent cyclization and N-alkylation of key cyanamide prepared
from 2-chloropyridines with different bromo acetophenones under basic
condition. Recently, Chang and co-workers reported an alternative
synthetic approach via I2/KI-mediated oxidative cyclization
of N-aryl amidines (Scheme 1).41 In addition,
Hajra et al.19 developed an oxidative diamination
reaction of nitroalkenes with 2-aminopyridines to form 2-nitro-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines
catalyzed by Fe(NO3)3. In this paper, only the
reduction of 2-nitro-3-phenylimidazopyridine to the corresponding
2-amino derivative was tested using Zn dust and NH4Cl in
acetic acid at 80 °C (Scheme 1).

Given the importance of this type of transformation
and in terms
of sustainability, the use of more eco-friendly, inexpensive, and
widely abundant catalyst for the synthesis of 2-amino-3-aryl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives continues to be a long-standing goal
of chemical research. In this respect, it is interesting that heterogeneous
catalysis offers advantages associated with catalyst recovery and
reusability, easy separation, and waste minimization. In light of
our ongoing research on developing sustainable catalytic processes
to construct N-heterocyclic organic molecules of high biological interest,42,43 and on the metal nanoparticle-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation processes
of nitroarenes into amines,44−47 herein we elaborate the synthesis of 2-amino-3-arylimidazo-[1,2-a]pyridines using Au/Al2O3 as a catalyst
and NaBH4 as a reducing agent in ambient conditions (Scheme 1). Our protocol also
provides access to a library of the corresponding 2-nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with excellent isolated yields and selectivity.
To the best of our knowledge, the use of Au/Al2O3 catalytic systems for the synthesis of both 2-nitro- and 2-amino-3-arylimidazo-[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives has not been reported yet (Scheme 1).

Results and Discussion
For the catalytic reductions, we employed commercially available
supported gold nanoparticles Au/TiO2, Au/Al2O3, and Al/ZnO, as well as the oxides TiO2 (Degussa),
ZnO, Al2O3, and SiO2. The commercial
catalyst Au/TiO2, Au/Al2O3, and Au/ZnO
feature a ca. 1 wt % Au loading and exhibit an average AuNPs size
of about 2–3 nm. The commercially available copper (I), copper
(II), silver (I), zinc (II), gold (I), and gold (III) salts were used
without further purification. The used nitroalkenes were prepared
according to the literature procedure48 starting with nitroalkane and the corresponding carbonyl compounds
through a condensation reaction (for detail experimental, see the Supporting Information). To optimize the reaction
conditions, 2-aminopyridine 1 and (E)-1-methyl-4-(2-nitrovinyl) benzene 2 were selected
as model substrates. The reaction was carried out in a sealed tube
with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) as the solvent at 80 °C under air
atmosphere for 24 h (Scheme 2). It is worth noting that a control experiment in the absence
of catalyst shows the formation of the Michael adduct 3 as the major product accompanied by small amount of the corresponding
2-nitro-4-methylphenyl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 4 in 13% relative yield, as measured by 1H NMR
of the crude reaction mixture (Table 1, entry 1). The structure of the adduct 4 was determined using two-dimensional homonuclear correlation spectroscopy 1H COSY (see the Supporting Information, Scheme S1). Furthermore, cyclization reaction of the adduct 3 in the presence of CuBr leads to the corresponding 3-nitro-4-methylphenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 5 (Scheme 2), and its structure was determined by 1H NMR and further confirmed with that given in the literature
(Scheme S2).16 Addition of small amount of D2O to the NMR tube solution
results in the disappearance of the NH peak at 5.23 ppm, as well as
the multiplicity change in the peak from quartet to triplet that corresponds
to the benzylic proton H2 at 5.65 ppm (see Scheme S3). Moreover, we studied the model reaction
in the presence of different copper salts, such as Cu(ClO4)2, Cu(OTf)2, CuBr2, Cu(NO3)2, Cu(OAc)2, and CuBr (Table S1, entries 1–6). In all the cases, mixtures
of the corresponding adduct 3 and the regioisomer 5 were mainly observed by 1H NMR. On the other
hand, using the corresponding Au(I) and Au(III) salts, AuCl3 and Ph3AuNTf2, low yields of 4 were obtained (Table S1, entries 7 and
8), whereas the reaction in the presence of AgOTf resulted in only
traces of product 4 (Table S1, entry 9). Similarly, the reactions using the corresponding Zn(II)
salts were studied, resulting in low to moderate yields of 4 (Table S1, entries 10–12), whereas
no reaction was observed with common Lewis acids such as AlCl3 or BF3·Et2O (Table S1, entries 13 and 14).

a Reaction
conditions: pyridin-2-amine 1 (0.35 mmol), (E)-1-methyl-4-(2-nitrovinyl)benzene 2 (0.3 mmol), catalyst
(% mol), and DCE (2 mL) at 80 °C
for 24 h. Seventy milligrams of γ-alumina was used.

b Based on the consumption of 2 determined from the crude 1H NMR mixture of the
reaction.

c Relative yields
of 3 and 4 were determined by 1H NMR from the
crude reaction mixture.

Next, we switched the catalyst to a series of different gold-supported
catalysts, such as the commercially available Au/TiO2,
Au/Al2O3, and Au/ZnO nanoparticles. Interestingly,
a remarkable increase in the yield of 4 was observed when Au/Al2O3 was used (Table 1, entry 4). Thus, subsequent experiment in the absence
of Au was performed to define the catalytic role of the γ-Al2O3 surface. Remarkably, γ-alumina promotes
most efficiently the coupling reaction providing 2-nitro-3-(p-tolyl)imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine 4 in 87%
relative yield (Table 1, entry 7). This finding indicates that the support γ-Al2O3 catalyzes also the imidazopyridine synthesis,
whereas Au nanoparticles seem to have no significant influence on
the reaction process. However, to support such a hypothesis, further
kinetic studies on the reaction profile vs different sizes and wt
% of the gold nanoparticles should be performed. On the contrary,
using the rest of the supported gold catalysts, the product 4 was formed in only 10–17% relative yields, calculated
by the 1H NMR of the crude reaction mixture (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). For comparison,
a series of different oxides including silica, TiO2 (Degussa),
and ZnO were also examined to evaluate their catalytic activities;
however, lower yields of 4 were obtained (Table 1, entries 5, 6, and 8). Encouraged
by these results, in the next set of experiments, we evaluated the
acid–base surface properties of γ-Al2O3 on the model reaction. It is noteworthy that the treatment
of γ-Al2O3 with aqueous hydrochloric acid
(HCl 0.3 M) increases its catalytic activity, resulting in quantitative
yield of 4, whereas the treatment of γ-Al2O3 with KOH resulted in considerable decrease in yield
of 4 (Table 1, entries 9 and 11). Moreover, increase in the acidity of
HCl solution resulted in a gradual drop in the yield of 4 (Table 1, entry 10).
It is worth noting that the present reaction did not occur when HCl
or KOH into the reaction was added to the solution in the absence
of alumina (Table 1, entries 12 and 13). Finally, the presence of CH3COOH
does not lead to a significant conversion or selectivity, as shown
in Table 1, entry 14.
The above results support the finding that γ-Al2O3 catalyzes the synthesis of 2-nitro-3-phenyl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine
under the present heterogeneous conditions.

Among the solvent
studied herein, 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) was
found to promote the synthesis of 2-nitro-3-phenyl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine 4 in a higher yield (Table S2,
entry 1). On the contrary, in the case of other aprotic and nonpolar
solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl carbonate, acetone, chloroform,
and toluene, the Michael adduct 3 was formed as the major
product (Table S2, entries 2–7).
Exceptionally, acetonitrile (MeCN) was found to accelerate the synthesis
of 4 as well, although in moderate yield of 65% (Table S2, entry 8). Interestingly, in the case
of a protic solvent such as methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH), the
corresponding 2-alkoxy-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine derivatives 6 and 7 were unexpectedly formed (Scheme 3 and Table S2, entries 9 and 10), and their structures were determined
by 1H NMR. Further studies on the structure limitation
of the synthesis procedure of 2-alkoxy-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine
derivatives under the present conditions are under investigation.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 2-Alkoxy-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine Products 6 and 7 via the Reaction between 1 and 2 Catalyzed by γ-Al2O3 in MeOH and EtOH, Respectively
With these optimized conditions, we further explore the
scope of
this catalytic transformation by incorporating a wide range of nitroalkenes 2 and 8–18 to gain direct
access to a library of 2-nitro-3-aryl imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines
derivatives 19–33 in high isolated
yields (Scheme 4).
For the synthetic procedure of nitroalkenes and their structure, see
the Experimental Section and the Scheme S4 in the Supporting Information. For
the present heterogeneous conditions, Au/Al2O3 (70 mg) was initially used as the catalyst for testing this optimization,
as shown in Scheme 4. The values not in parentheses correspond to the isolated yields
of each product. Regardless of the electronic nature of the phenyl
rings of the nitrostyrenes, bearing even electron-donating (Me, MeO)
or electron-withdrawing (Cl, COOMe) groups, the desired 2-nitro-imidazopyridine
derivatives were formed in good to high isolated yields and regioselectivity
(Scheme 4). In addition,
naphthyl and heterocyclic aromatic substituted nitroalkenes 17 and 18 give the corresponding product 29 and 30 in high yields of 91 and 90%, respectively.
Moreover, the reaction between 3-methyl-2-amino pyridine (1′) and different nitrostyrenes was analyzed and the corresponding
substituted imidazopyridines 31–33 were formed in good isolated yields (Scheme 4). These results indicate the broad generality
of the present catalytic heterogeneous methodology toward the regioselective
synthesis of 2-nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines. The structures
of the above synthesized imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines 19–33 were determined by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HR-MS. For comparison, the same catalytic reactions
were accomplished using γ-Al2O3 as a catalyst
(70 mg) in DCE at 70 °C within 24 h. In all cases, good to high
isolated yields (Scheme 4, values in parentheses) further support the importance of the synthesis
of the present heterogeneous catalytic system.

Scheme 4 Regioselective Synthesis
of 2-Nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines 19–33 Promoted by Au/Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3
Furthermore, we explore the scope of this catalytic transformation
by studying the selective reduction of the synthesized 2-nitro-derivatives
(19–33) to the corresponding 2-amino-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines
(38–52) through a gold-catalyzed
transfer hydrogenation process (Scheme 5). For this reason, the reduction of 19 and 20 was initially studied in the presence of NaBH4 as the reducing agent and in the absence of catalyst. In
both cases, the corresponding N-hydroxylamines 34 and 35 were formed as major products, accompanied
by unidentified products as observed from the 1H NMR of
the crude reaction mixture (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). Incorporation of the Au/Al2O3 catalytic system led to the formation of the
corresponding amines 38 and 39 in quantitative
yields of up to 99% (Table 2, entries 3 and 4). For comparison, using Au/Al2O3 in the presence of 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS)
as the reducing agent, under ambient conditions, the corresponding
nitroso-compounds (34 and 35) and N-hydroxylamine derivatives (36 and 37) accompanied by a mixture of unidentified products were observed
(Table 2, entries 5
and 6). Noteworthy, the 2-nitroso-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives 34 and 35 have not
been detected in the literature yet. However, different methodologies
for the synthesis of 3-nitroso-2-aryl-imidazo-[1,2-a]pyridines have been reported.49−51 Based on these encouraging results,
the Au/Al2O3–NaBH4 heterogeneous
catalytic system was used for the in situ reduction of the initially
synthesized 2-nitro imidazopyridine derivatives (19–33) under ambient conditions and short reaction time (1 h).
As shown in Scheme 4, the corresponding 2-amino-3-aryl imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines
(38–52) were formed in good to high
isolated yields in the range of 80–98%. From the synthetic
point of view, this two-step process for the synthesis of a series
of 2-amino-3-aryl[1,2-α]imidazopyridines 38–52, starting from 2-aminopyridine and nitrostyrene in the
presence of Au/Al2O3 and NaBH4, has
not been reported in the literature so far (Scheme 5). All the structures of the 2-amino-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were determined by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HR-MS.

As mentioned in the introduction
section, the approaches to synthesize
2-amino-imidazopyridine derivatives include different retrosynthetic
scenarios;38−41 however, only one example has been reported in previous study, which
referred to the reduction of 20 to the corresponding
2-amino derivative 39, using Zn dust and NH4Cl in acetic acid, at 80 °C (as shown in Scheme 1). The main aim of that study was to synthesize
the 2-nitro-aryl derivatives using Fe(NO3)3 as
a catalyst.19 Herein, to further support
the present proposed synthetic methodology, a one-pot two-step laboratory-scale
procedure was performed for the direct synthesis of 39 starting from 2.5 mmol of 2-aminopyridine (1) and 2
mmol of nitrostyrene (2), without the isolation of the
initially formed 2-nitro-imidazopyridine 20 (Scheme 6). Thus, after the
formation of 20 (monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC)), the solvent DCE was evaporated and MeOH was added to the appropriate
amount of NaBH4 for the reduction process. After the completion
of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the mixture was filtered over
a short path of silica to hold the catalyst, the solvent was evaporated,
and the produced amine 38 was purified with column chromatography
and isolated in good total yield of 79% (see Experimental
Section). This one-pot process supports undoubtedly the synthetic
importance of the present catalytic methodology. Importantly, no byproducts
were observed during the catalytic procedure.

Scheme 6 One-Pot Two-Step
Synthesis of 2-Amino-3-tolyl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine 4 with the Au/Al2O3–NaBH4 Catalytic
System
Because of the heterogenicity
of the present catalytic system,
Au/Al2O3 can be easily separated from the reaction
mixture by simple filtration and can be reused for the next catalytic
reaction. To that end, the recyclability and stability of the catalyst
were examined. First, the synthesis of 2-nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 4 was tested in the above-described
conditions and the catalyst could be used twice without any significant
loss of its catalytic activity. However, in the third run, 64 and
36% relative yields of 4 and intermediate 3 (Figure 1A) were
observed, respectively, whereas 3 was formed as the major
product in the fourth run. It is noteworthy that 3 does
not yield the imidazopyridine regioisomer 5 in the presence
of Au/Al2O3, although it yields the desired
product 4, as shown in Scheme S5. On the basis of these results, we can hypothesize that 3 was formed through a noncatalytic reaction between 1 and 2 due to the possible gradual deactivation of the
catalyst, as also described above (Scheme 2). Consequently, the reduction of 4 to the corresponding amine 38 was studied using Au/Al2O3 as a catalyst and NaBH4 and methanol
as solvents at rt. Under the present reductive conditions, the catalyst
was found to be active even after five recycle runs, as shown in Figure 1B (yields >95%).
Herein, after each catalytic cycle, the reaction mixture was centrifuged
and the catalyst was separated, washed with methanol, dried for 2
h at 100 °C, and used for the next reduction process. These results
enhance the synthetic approach of the present catalytic protocol for
the regioselective synthesis of 2-amino-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines.

study of the Au/Al2O3 catalyst
(experimental conditions: 70 mg of catalyst, 0.35 mmol of 1, 0.3 mmol of 2, 1 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), heating
at 80 °C, t = 24 h). (B) Recycling study of
the Au/Al2O3–NaBH4 catalyst

On the basis of our experimental
results, further experiments were
carried out for structure limitation propose and mechanistic studies.
(a) The use of aliphatic nitroalkene (E)-3-methyl-1-nitrobut-1-ene
(53) in place of nitrostyrenes did not yield the desired
imidazopyridine derivative (Scheme 7). (b) In addition, the use of α-ethyl-substituted
nitrostyrene 54, instead of nitrostyrene 2, did not promote the transformation (Scheme 7). These observations exclude the use of
aliphatic and α-substituted nitro alkenes, although they support
the necessity of a phenyl-substituted nitrostyrene in the convenient
synthesis of 2-nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine derivatives.
(c) The use of methyl propiolate 55 yields a mixture
of unidentified products; however, the use of other conjugated compounds,
such as trans-cinnamic methyl ester 56 in place of nitrostyrene 2, showed no reactivity under
the present conditions (Scheme 7). These results indicate the necessity of the conjugated
nitroalkenes in the synthesis of imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine.

Scheme 7 Structure Limitation Studies for the Synthesis of 2-Nitro-imidazopyridine
Derivatives
Thus, a plausible
mechanistic pathways for the synthesis of 2-nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines
is proposed. Initially, the surface of Au/Al2O3 adsorbs the 2-aminopyridine and nitroalkene substrates via the amino
and nitro groups, respectively. This adsorption is probably enhanced
by the nature of Al2O3 as the Lewis acid, as
well as by a gold electronic complexation with the nitro group. In
the first part of the mechanism, a hydrogen atom transfer and/or an
electron transfer mechanism can occur, leading to the generation of
anionic intermediate I, as shown in Scheme 8. After that, I was transformed into the cyclized reduced form II,
which, after protonation from the surface presumably, is oxidized
to the desired imidazopyridines product (Scheme 8). In the second part of the mechanism, a
transfer hydrogenation process occurs for the selective reduction
of the produced 2-nitroderivative to the corresponding 2-amino imidazopyridine
derivative (Scheme 8). The latter pathway also found support in our previous mechanistic
studies on the reduction of nitroarenes to anilines, in which a proposed
Au–H species are responsible for this selective reduction transformation.46

Scheme 8 Plausible Mechanism for the Synthesis of
2-Nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine
and 2-Amino-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine Catalyzed by Au/Al2O3
Conclusions
In conclusion, Au/Al2O3 represents an efficient
bifunctional catalyst for the regioselective synthesis of 2-amino-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-a]-pyridines. First, the corresponding 2-nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-a] pyridine derivatives were formed through a stepwise reaction
between 2-amino pyridine and appropriate nitroalkene. The catalyst
could be used twice without any significant loss of its activity.
Importantly, γ-Al2O3 as a heterogeneous
surface can also catalyze the above process. Second, the chemoselective
reduction of the synthesized 2-nitro derivatives was performed using
Au/Al2O3 in the presence of NaBH4 in ambient conditions. The second catalytic pathway was found to
be more efficient, and the catalyst can be used at least five times
without significant decrease in its activity. Thus, a series of substituted
2-amino-3-arylimidazo[1,2-α]pyridines were prepared—for
the first time—under mild conditions using the present catalytic
methodology in excellent yields through a fast and clean process.

purification. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on Millipore
precoated silica gel plates (0.20 mm thick, particle size 25 μm).
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on an Agilent 500
{1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz)}. Chemical
shifts for 1H NMR were reported as δ values and coupling
constants were measured in hertz (Hz). The following abbreviations
were used for spin multiplicity: s = singlet, br s = broad singlet,
d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, quin = quintet, dd = double
of doublets, ddd = double doublet of doublets, and m = multiplet.
Mass spectra (HRMS) were determined on an electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) by using a ThermoFisher Scientific (Bremen,
Germany) model LTQ Orbitrap Discovery MS at a flow rate of 10 μL/min
using a syringe pump. The infusion experiments were run using a standard
ESI source operating in a positive ionization mode. Source operating
conditions were a 3.7 kV spray voltage and a 300 °C heated capillary
temperature.

General Synthesis of Nitroalkenes 2 and 8–18
All the nitroalkenes
were synthesized
according to the literature procedure.48 To a solution of ammonium acetate (12.5 mmol) in acetic acid (10
mL), aldehyde (5 mmol) and nitroethane (15.5 mmol) were added. The
mixture was heated at reflux for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled
at room temperature and then poured into ice-water to form the solid
mixture of product that was isolated by filtration through a short
path of silica. The organic solvent was then evaporated under vacuum
and each residue was separated by column chromatography using silica
gel to give the corresponding products in good to high isolated yields.
All the spectroscopic data were compared to those in the literature.48

Synthesis of 2-Nitro-3-aryl-imidazopyridines
from β-Nitrostyrenes
and 2-Aminopyridines
To a sealed tube, which contains 0.3
mmol of β-nitrostyrene and 0.35 mmol of 2-aminopyridine, were
added 1 mL of DCE as a solvent and 70 mg Au/Al2O3 as a catalyst. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for
24 h. The reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
and the slurry was filtered under pressure through a short pad of
silica to withhold the catalyst with the aid of dichloromethane (DCM)
and EtOAc. The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum and purified by
column chromatography on a silica gel using a gradient mixture of
EtOAc–hexane to afford the corresponding products in good yields.

Synthesis of 3-Nitro-2-aryl-imidazopyridines from β-Nitrostyrenes
and 2-Aminopyridines
To a sealed tube, which contains 0.3
mmol of β-nitrostyrene and 0.35 mmol of 2-aminopyridine, were
added 1 mL of DCE as a solvent and Cu(NO3)2 as
a catalyst (20% mol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C
for 24 h. The reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC). After the completion of the reaction, the slurry was filtered
under pressure through a short pad of silica to withhold the catalyst
with the aid of DCM and EtOAc. The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum
and purified by column chromatography on a silica gel using a gradient
mixture of EtOAc–hexane to afford the corresponding products
in good yields.

Catalytic Reduction of 2-Nitro-3-aryl-imidazo[1,2-α]pyridines
with NaBH4 in the Presence of Au/Al2O3
Gold catalyst Au/Al2O3 (1 mol % Au)
was placed in a 5 mL glass reactor (vial), followed by the addition
of methanol (1 mL), nitro compound (0.1 mmol), and NaBH4 (0.4 mmol); the reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature
for a selected time. The reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC); after the completion of the reaction, the slurry was filtered
under pressure through a short pad of silica to withhold the catalyst
with the aid of methanol (∼5 mL). The filtrate was evaporated
under vacuum to afford the corresponding products in pure form.

One-Pot Two-Step Laboratory-Scale Procedure for the Synthesis
of 38
To a sealed tube, which contains 2 mmol
of β-nitrostyrene 2 and 2.5 mmol of 2-aminopyridine 1, were added 10 mL of DCE as a solvent and 250 mg of Au/Al2O3 as a catalyst. The reaction mixture was stirred
at 80 °C for 24 h. The reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC). After the completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated
and the residue was used for the second pathway. Then, 10 mL of MeOH
was added as a solvent, as well as 10 mmol of NaBH4 in
portions. The reaction progressed under stirring for appropriate time;
after the completion of the reaction, the slurry was filtered under
pressure through a short pad of silica to withhold the catalyst with
the aid of methanol (∼10 mL). The filtrate was evaporated under
vacuum and the corresponding product 38 was purified
by column chromatography on silica gel using a gradient solvent mixture
of EtOAc/hexane from 10:1 to 1:3 (79% yield).
