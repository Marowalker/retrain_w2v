Genistin
and its aglycone genistein of isoflavone are naturally
occurring in plants. The aim of this study is to develop an experimental
animal model of enterohepatic circulation to investigate the metabolic
biotransformation of genistin and genistein in rats. A paired-rat
model was developed in which the drug was administered intravenously
to the donor rat whose bile duct was cannulated into the duodenum
of the untreated recipient rat. The blood sample was collected from
the jugular vein of the donor and recipient rats after genistin administration.
The results demonstrate that genistein was detected in both the donor
and recipient rats after genistein administration (50 mg/kg, iv) in
the donor rat, which suggested that the enterohepatic circulation
of genistein occurred. The same phenomenon happened again in the biotransformation
after genistin administration (50 mg/kg, iv) in the donor rat. Genistein
was detected in the recipient rat’s blood sample after treatment
with β-glucuronidase, which suggested that enzymatic hydrolysis
occurred in the transformation of genistin into genistein. In conclusion,
the research revealed the metabolic pathway of the glucuronidation
of genistin into genistein.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Genistein
(4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), one of the major
isoflavones in soybeans, Sophora japonica seeds,1 and botanical herbs such as Pueraria montana Radix.2 Genistin (genistein-7-d-glucoside) is a glycoside form
of genistein found in soy-derived foods. These isoflavones have been
proven to be beneficial in the treatment of osteoporosis,1 diabetes,3 and menopausal
symptoms.4

The biotransformation
mechanism of isoflavones has been previously
described in animal experiments and human subjects, such as a previous
study, demonstrating that genistin mainly underwent phase II biotransformation
of methylation, glucosylation, glucuronidation, sulfonation, and acetylation
in rats.5 The multiple complex metabolites
of genistein-7-glucuronide, 4′-glucuronide, 7-sulfate, 4′-sulfate,
4′,7-diglucuronide, 7-glucuronide-4′-sulfate, and genistein
have been observed in human plasma after ingestion of genistein and
its glucoside in healthy young women.6 The
malonylglucoside conjugation pathway is common for the isoflavones.
Malonylgenistin is a metabolite of genistin in which the hydroxy hydrogen
is replaced by a malonyl group. However, the malonylglucoside conjugates
may not be the major metabolic product for the isoflavones.7 Not only in the phase II biotransformation of
genistein but also in its biliary excretion,8 it is suggested that genistein and genistin may possibly go through
the pathway of enterohepatic circulation. A potential metabolic pathway
of genistin and genistein is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Potential metabolic pathway of genistin and
genistein. The glucoside
of genistin can be degraded by the sugar group into genistein by the
enzyme β-glucosidase. CYP: cytochrome P450; UGT: UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase;
and SULT: sulfotransferase.

Enterohepatic circulation represents the circulation that is utilized
when a substance is absorbed through the portal vein into the liver.
The substance is then excreted with biliary acids, bilirubin, or other
substances from the liver as bile into the duodenum. Afterward, these
substances are moved into the small intestine and absorbed by enterocytes
and transported back to the liver. Enterohepatic circulation may be
significantly affected by the chemical and physical characteristics
of the substance itself. The formation of metabolites no matter whether
phase I or phase II during absorption is also affected by enterocytes
and hepatocytes during their circulation through the biliary system
and intestinal tract.9 A previous report
demonstrated that a double peak phenomenon was found in genistein,
which suggests an enterohepatic circulation phenomenon.10 In addition, our previous report indicates that
genistein has been detected in bile juice, and the distribution ratio
of bile-to-blood (AUCbile/AUCblood) is 1.85
± 0.42, which suggests the biliary excretion of genistein.11 After treatment with the P-glycoprotein inhibitor
cyclosporine, the bile-to-blood distribution ratio decreased, which
suggests that the biliary excretion of genistein may be related to
the P-glycoprotein transport system.11 An
additional survey with the keywords “enterohepatic circulation
and genistein” in PubMed found nine articles. However, no article
was found referring to the enterohepatic circulation of genistin and
its aglycone.

Based on the above survey, we hypothesized that
genistin and genistein
may undergo enterohepatic circulation through biotransformation. To
investigate this hypothesis and the potential mechanism of the enterohepatic
circulation of genistin and genistein, a paired-rat experimental design
utilizing donor and recipient rats was used. The aim of this study
was to develop a validated analytical system to monitor the analytes
of genistin and genistein from the donor and recipient rats. Based
on these analytical data, the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic circulation
of genistin and genistein were evaluated.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Method Validation
2.1.1 Linearity and Limit of Detection
The calibration curves
of genistein and genistin in rat plasma were
obtained through a validated chromatographic system over the concentration
range of 0.05–50 μg/mL. The concentrations of genistein
and genistin were linearly related to the peak area in the chromatogram
(r2 > 0.995).

2.1.2 Recovery
The extraction recovery
of genistein and genistin in rat plasma was 97–99 and 89–98%,
respectively (Supporting Information Table S1). The results demonstrated that the values were all within the acceptable
range and the method was accurate and precise.

2.1.3 Stability
Stability data of genistein
and genistin in rat plasma are summarized in Supporting Information Table S2. The relative standard deviation (RSD)
of genistein and genistin were within ±20%, and the results indicated
that the three analytes in plasma were stable for 4 h at room temperature
and for 12 h in the autosampler condition after preparation.

2.1.4 Precision and Accuracy
In interday
analyses, the precision and accuracy of genistein ranged from 2.27
to 12.1 and −6.21–15%, respectively, and the precision
and accuracy of genistin ranged from 2.37 to 18.2 and −9.80–14.1%,
respectively. In intraday analyses, the precision and accuracy of
genistein ranged from 5.61 to 11.3 and −7.76–18.2%,
respectively, and the precision and accuracy of genistin ranged from
4.88 to 14.0 and 4.98–17.1%, respectively (Supporting Information Tables S3 and S4). Thus, the intraday and interday
accuracy and precision were found to be acceptable for genistein and
genistin analyses in support of further pharmacokinetic studies. The
data demonstrated excellent reproducibility.

2.2 Pharmacokinetics and Enterohepatic Circulation
of Genistein
The analytical data demonstrated in Figure S1A shows the chromatogram of blank rat
plasma. No discernible peak was observed. Figure S1B shows the chromatogram of rat plasma spiked with genistein
(1 μg/mL) and an internal standard (7.5 μg/mL). Figure S1C shows the chromatogram of the plasma
sample obtained 45 min after genistein (50 mg/kg, iv) administration
in the donor rat. Figure S1D shows the
chromatogram of the plasma sample obtained at 10 min in the recipient
rat. The mean plasma concentration–time profiles of genistein
administration (50 mg/kg, iv) are shown in Figure 2. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
by the WinNonlin program, and the data are demonstrated in Table 1. The maximal concentration
was 16.93 μg/mL and detected at the initial time point. Afterward,
the concentration was gradually decreased, indicating a one-compartment
model. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was lower than half an hour, indicating a rapid decrease in the
systemic circulation, and the genistein concentration was lower than
undetectable limit at approximately 2 h after genistein administration
(50 mg/kg, iv).

Figure 2 Concentration–time curve of genistein administration
(50
mg/kg, iv) in the donor rat. Genistein was detected in the plasma
of both the donor and recipient rats (n = 6).

a Data are expressed as the mean ±
SEM (n = 6). The enterohepatic circulation is represented
as the AUC ratio (AUCrecipient/AUCdonor).

To monitor the enterohepatic circulation
of genistein, the genistein
level was detected in the recipient rat at 10 min after genistein
administration (50 mg/kg, iv). However, the highest concentration
of genistein was approximately 0.2 μg/mL, and the level of genistein
approached the detection limit at up to 30 min. The area under the
concentration curve (AUC) of the donor and recipient rats was 460.5
± 92.9 and 2.91 ± 1.26 min μg/mL, respectively. The
enterohepatic circulation of genistein is defined as the AUC ratio
of recipient and donor (AUCrecipient/AUCdonor). Based on the experimental model, the enterohepatic circulation
of genistein was 2.91/460.5 = 0.63% (Table 1).

Enterohepatic circulation occurs
through biliary excretion and
intestinal reabsorption, which may involve phase II metabolic conjugation
and deconjugation. Compared to resveratrol, an aglycone of flavonoids,12 the enterohepatic recirculation was assessed
using the ratio of AUC0–t of the
bile-recipient rat relative to the bile-donor rat. The data demonstrated
that the enterohepatic recirculation of resveratrol and resveratrol
glucuronide were calculated to be 24.7 ± 15.1 and 24.0 ±
8.5%, respectively. The enterohepatic circulation of resveratrol was
higher than that of genistein. A potential explanation is the different
experimental model used to measure the aglycone resveratrol reflected
hepatobiliary excretion from the bile duct but not the systemic circulation.
Another explanation of the poor enterohepatic circulation may be that
the enterohepatic recirculation contributes to the overall systemic
circulation and complex metabolism.9 The
third explanation is that the motility of the gastrointestinal tract
may be markedly reduced during anesthesia and consequently the drug
absorption is also reduced.13 The phenomena
of poor bioavailability and poor enterohepatic circulation agree with
the terpene lactones of the leaf extracts of Ginkgo
biloba.14

2.3 Pharmacokinetics and Enterohepatic Circulation
of Genistin
Genistin preserves its hydrophilic characteristics
more than genistein does because of the presence of a glycoside, which
may shorten the retention time in the chromatogram. The analytical
data demonstrated in Figure S2A show the
chromatogram of blank rat plasma. No discernible peak was observed. Figure S2B shows the chromatogram of rat plasma
spiked with genistin (1 μg/mL), an internal standard (7.5 μg/mL),
and genistein (1 μg/mL). Figure S2C shows the chromatogram of the plasma sample obtained 45 min after
genistin (50 mg/kg, iv) administration in the donor rat. Both genistin
and genistein were detected in the donor rat. However, both genistin
and genistein were not observed in the recipient rat (Figure S2D), which suggests that genistin underwent
deglucosidation and was conjugated to produce genistein glucuronide.
The chromatogram of Figure S2E shows the
recipient plasma sample collected at 45 min after genistin administration
(50 mg/kg, iv), and the plasma sample was incubated 1 h with β-glucuronidase.
These data suggested that genistin first underwent deglucosidation,
followed by conjugation with glucuronide. To monitor the total levels
of genistein and genistin and their glucuronide products, glucuronidase
was used for enzymatic hydrolysis. These data demonstrated that both
genistin and genistein were detected after treatment with β-glucuronidase.

The pharmacokinetic curve of genistin in the donor rat after genistin
administration (50 mg/kg, iv) showed that the concentration of genistin
gradually decreased, which suggests that genistin is initially distributed
into a central compartment (Figure 3). The elimination half-life was approximately 30 min,
and the concentration of genistin in the donor rat decreased at a
regular elimination rate (Table 2). This pharmacokinetic behavior can be explained by
a one-compartment model with rapid equilibrium with the tissue compartment.
The elimination phenomenon of genistin in the donor rat of the enterohepatic
circulation experimental model is in agreement with the metabolic
disposition of chloramphenicol.15 However,
another experiment with colchicine exhibited slow equilibration with
peripheral tissues, which describes a two-compartment model in the
donor rat.16

curve of genistin administration (50
mg/kg, iv) in the donor rat. Genistein was detected in the plasma
of both the donor and recipient rats (n = 6).

A previous report demonstrated that the bioavailability
of genistein
was higher for aglycone than that for its glycoside.17 However, genistin was undetectable in the recipient rat,
which may be explained by the level of genistin being lower than the
detection limit in this analytical system. Another explanation may
be that genistin has been metabolized via phase II conjugation to
produce its metabolite. To investigate the possible mechanism of phase
II metabolism, the plasma concentration of genistein was determined
by enzymatic hydrolysis. Both donor and recipient plasma samples were
treated with β-glucuronidase and incubated in a 37 °C water
bath for deconjugation. The results demonstrated that genistein was
detected in the plasma of both donor and recipient rats when treated
with β-glucuronidase (Figure 3). These data suggested that the level of phase II
genistein glucuronide was higher than that of genistein itself, which
suggested the high efficacy of enzymatic glucuronidation.18 The UDP-glucuronosyltransferases serve as versatile
and important conjugation enzymes in the phase II biotransformation
of xenobiotics.19 The results agree with
the previous report in which liquid chromatography coupled to a single-quadrupole
mass spectrometry was used to detect genistein and its metabolites.20 Genistein glucuronide was the predominant metabolite,
and only small amounts of sulfate conjugate and aglycone were observed.20 These data reflect the previous report that
the total genistein was composed of mixed conjugates of glucuronide
and sulfate conjugation.21 Genistein deconjugation
may occur in multiple targets, such as genistein-7-β-d-glucuronide and genistein-4′-β-d-glucuronide.22

The manner of hepatobiliary excretion
for the flavonoids suggests
that these phytochemicals potentially undergo enterohepatic circulation.23,24 The experimental results indicated that genistein (Figure 2) was detected in the recipient
and donor rats following genistein administration (50 mg/kg, iv),
which is consistent with the previous reports of other flavonoids,
such as fisetin, genistein, biochanin A, apigenin, and chrysin.23,24

3 Material and Methods
3.1 Chemicals
and Reagents
Genistein,
genistin, and β-glucuronidase (EC3.2.1.31, type H-1, 330 000
units/g solid also containing sulfatase activity) from Helix pomatia and ornidazole as internal standards
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The solvents and
reagents for chromatography were purchased from Spectrum (NJ) and
Macron (Hamilton, PA). The standard solutions of genistein and genistin
were stored in methanol at −20 °C. Triple deionized water
from Millipore (Bedford, MA) was used for all preparations.

3.2 Liquid Chromatography
The high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a chromatographic
pump (LC-20AT; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), an on-line injector (SIL-20C)
equipped with a 10 μL sample loop to inject the sample and a
photodiode array detector (SPD-M20A). Genistein, genistin and an internal
standard were separated with an Agilent ZORBAX SB-phenyl column (150
× 4.6 mm id particle size 5 μm). The mobile phase for the
genistein group was water and acetonitrile (61:39, v/v) at a flow
rate of 0.8 mL/min. The mobile phase for the genistin group was also
water and acetonitrile (68:32, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.
The optimal photodiode-array detection for genistein and genistin
was set at a wavelength of 254 nm.

3.3 Method
Validation
3.3.1 Calibration Curve
All calibration
curves were required to have a correlation value of at least 0.995.
Calibration standards of plasma samples were prepared by adding known
amounts of genistein and genistin (10 μL) into the blank rat
plasma (40 μL) to give a range of 0.05–50 μg/mL.
These mixtures were supplemented with 150 μL of internal standard
solution (10 μg/mL).

3.3.2 Precision and Accuracy
The intraday
and interday variabilities for genistein and genistin were determined
by quantitating six replicates at concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5,
1, 5, 10, and 50 μg/mL using the HPLC method described above
on the same day and six consecutive days, respectively. The accuracy
(% bias) was calculated from the nominal concentration (Cnom) and the mean value of observed concentrations (Cobs) as follows: accuracy (% bias) = [(Cnom – Cobs)/Cnom] × 100. The precision (relative
standard deviation: RSD) was calculated from the observed concentrations
as follows: precision (% RSD) = [standard deviation (SD)/Cobs] × 100. The same data were used to determine
both accuracy and precision.

3.3.3 Recovery
Recovery was assessed
at three different concentrations (0.05, 5, and 50 μg/mL) by
comparing the peak area of postextraction spiked samples with that
of a standard solution.

3.3.4 Stability
The
short- and long-term
stabilities were evaluated to determine the stability of genistein
and genistin in plasma samples under different conditions, including
room-temperature stability, autosampler stability, and freeze–thaw
stability. All stability tests were performed at three different concentrations:
low (0.05 μg/mL), medium (5 μg/mL), and high (50 μg/mL).
The room-temperature stability was conducted on analytes at room temperature
for 4 h. The long-term stability was evaluated after storage of the
samples at −80 °C for 2 weeks. The autosampler stability
was evaluated by analyzing analytes in the sample injector at 8 °C
for 12 h. The freeze–thaw stability of the analytes was assessed
by a comparison of plasma samples after three freeze–thaw cycles
with a frozen temperature (−80 °C) and a thawing temperature
(25 °C) on consecutive days.

3.4 Experimental
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley
rats (220–280 g) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center
at National Yang-Ming University. All experimental protocols involving
animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC number: 1080113) of the National Yang-Ming
University. Laboratory rodent diet 5001 (PMI Feeds, Richmond, IN)
was used for food. Rats were housed with a 12 h light/dark photoperiod
cycle and given ad libitum access to food and water. The experimental
animal model for enterohepatic circulation is shown in Figure 4. The bile duct of the donor
animal was cannulated proximal to the liver with a 15 cm section of
polyethylene tubing (Intramedic PE-10, ID 0.28 mm; OD 0.61 mm, Sparks,
MD), the other end of which was inserted through the bile duct into
the duodenum of the recipient rat. To balance the fluid losses and
gains in the donor and recipient rats, the bile duct of the recipient
rat was also cannulated to channel bile back to the donor rat. The
animals were divided into two groups, the genistein group (50 mg/kg,
iv) and the genistin group (50 mg/kg, iv). Following a 1 h period
of stabilization, the drug was administered to the donor rat through
a femoral cannula. The blood samples (150 μL) were collected
through the donor’s and recipient’s carotid cannulas
at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min.

Figure 4 Experimental
animal model for enterohepatic circulation. The donor
rat received the drug and the recipient rat did not receive any drug.
The cannulation demonstrated that a PE-10 at the common bile duct
of the donor rat cannulated to the duodenum of the recipient rat.
The cannulation of (b) demonstrated that a PE-10 at the common bile
duct of the recipient rat cannulated to the duodenum of the donor
rat.

3.5 Sample
Preparation
Each collected
blood sample was transferred to a heparinized microcentrifuge tube
and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 10 min. The plasma (50 μL)
was then mixed with 150 μL of internal standard solution (10
μg/mL). The denatured protein precipitate was separated by vortex
for 20 s and finally centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 10 min at
4 °C.

3.6 Deconjugation
For genistein deconjugation,
aliquots (50 μL) of plasma sample were incubated with 10 μL
of β-glucuronidase in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h. Following
incubation, the internal standard solution was added to denature the
protein precipitate.

3.7 Calculation and Statistical
Analysis
The WinNonlin Standard Edition (version 1.1, Scientific
Consulting
Inc., Apex, NC) was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic data, and
the results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation.

4 Conclusions
The present study demonstrated
a paired-rat experimental model
to reveal that genistein was detected in both the donor and the recipient
rats after genistein administration (50 mg/kg, iv) in the donor rat.
The AUC ratio represents the enterohepatic circulation of the analytes,
and the data demonstrated that the recipient and donor AUC ratio (AUCrecipient/AUCdonor) was approximately 0.63%. Genistein
was detected in the recipient rat’s blood sample after treatment
with β-glucuronidase, which suggested that enzymatic hydrolysis
occurred in the transformation of genistin into genistein. The research
demonstrated that genistin was hydrolyzed by β-glucosidase into
genistein and then went through phase II biotransformation by UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase
to produce genistein glucuronide.

Data are expressed as the
mean + SEM (n = 6).
Significant differences were observed between the donor and recipient
groups.
