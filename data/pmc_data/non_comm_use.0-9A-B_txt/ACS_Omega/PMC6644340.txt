The
performance of semiconducting polymers strongly depends on
their intra- and intermolecular electronic interactions. Therefore,
the morphology and particularly crystallinity and crystal structure
play a crucial role in enabling a sufficient overlap between the orbitals
of neighboring polymers. A new solution-based in situ polymerization
for the fabrication of native polythiophene thin films is presented,
which exploits the film formation process to influence the polymer
crystal structure in the resulting thin films. The synthesis of the
insoluble polythiophene is based on an oxidative reaction in which
the oxidizing agent, iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate
(FeTos), initially oxidizes the monomers to enable the polymer chain
growth and secondly the final polymers, thereby chemically doping
the polythiophene. To exploit the fact that the doped polythiophene
has a different crystal packing structure compared to the undoped
polythiophene, we investigate the structural effect of this inherent
doping process by varying the amounts of FeTos in the reaction mixture,
creating polythiophene thin films with different degrees of doping.
The structural investigation performed by means of grazing incidence
wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) suggests that the strongly doped
polymer chains aggregate in a π-stacked manner in the film formation
process. Moreover, this π-stacking can be maintained after the
removal of the dopant molecules. GIWAXS measurements, molecular dynamics
simulations, and spectroscopic analysis suggest the presence of polythiophene
in a novel and stable crystal structure with an enhanced intermolecular
interaction.

Introduction
Semiconducting polymers
are the subject of intense research because
of their highly attractive applications in organic electronic devices.1−3 The charge carrier transport in the conjugated polymers takes place
either along the conjugated backbone of a single polymer chain (intramolecular)
or through the overlapping orbitals of neighboring molecules (intermolecular).
While the intramolecular transport requires an elongated and planarized
backbone for an outstretched conjugated system, the intermolecular
transport depends on the overlap of the orbitals and therefore on
the geometry of the backbone aggregation, i.e., the crystal structure.
Hence, the electronic properties of semiconducting polymers are strongly
dictated by their morphology and crystallinity.4,5 Thin
films of semiconducting polymers, however, are often amorphous or
semicrystalline, creating a need for methods to enhance their crystallinity.
Changing the molecular structure of the polymers is the most common
approach to induce crystallinity. The addition of, for example, electronically
insulating alkyl side chains to the backbone strongly increases the
tendency of semiconducting polymers to crystallize, leading to a significant
improvement of their electronic properties. Moreover, the side chains
enhance the polymer solubility, enabling an easier processing from
solution. One of the most investigated semiconducting polymers that
was designed accordingly is the polythiophene (PT) derivative poly-3-hexylthiophene
(P3HT).

In this letter, we present how crystallization and intermolecular
interaction of polythiophene (PT) can be steered by the choice of
processing route instead. We introduce a solution-based in situ polymerization
which employs iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate hexahydrate
(FeTos) as an oxidizing agent and a chemical dopant in the same fabrication
step. The included doping process additionally has a strong effect
on polymer aggregation, inducing a new and stable PT crystal structure
that leads to an enhanced chromophore interaction within the semiconducting
thin films. Since the dopant is rinsed out after the synthesis, no
electronically inactive material remains incorporated in the insoluble
thin films.

Results and Discussion
We choose to perform the oxidative
polymerization reaction with
FeTos, as it is well-established in the in situ synthesis of high-performing
poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) thin films.6 In our study, bithiophene (BT) serves as a monomer molecule
for the polymerization of polythiophene. We perform the in situ polymerization
from a metastable reaction mixture of both BT and FeTos. While within
the dilute solution the reaction is prevented by the close redox potentials
of the two reactants, the polymerization only starts during the processing,
when the concentration of the reactants is significantly increased
by the drying of the solvent.7,8 The reaction mechanism
can be divided into two subsequent steps.9 Initially, iron(III) ions oxidize the monomer molecules to radical
cations which subsequently polymerize. Depending on the employed amount
of oxidizing agent, the already synthesized polymer chains are further
oxidized by excess iron(III) ions in a second step. Effectively, this
further oxidation is a chemical doping of the chains, introducing
free charge carriers into the conjugated molecules.9 The positive charges on the chain are stabilized by the
anions of FeTos, the tosylates, which are electrostatically attached
to it. Simulations show that the tosylates align perpendicular to
the polythiophene backbones.10 We are interested
in fabricating an insoluble semiconducting material with improved
performance, exploiting the doping procedure during the processing.
We therefore spin coat the metastable mixture and subsequently rinse
out all residual monomers and oxidant molecules. It is known that
the choice of washing solvent has a strong effect on the electronic
properties of the obtained PT.11 While
rinsing in acetonitrile leaves the polymer chains in their doped and
therefore in conducting state, ethanol additionally de-dopes the PT
and removes the previously electrostatically attached tosylate counter
ions, leaving PT in its semiconducting, unsubstituted state. Hence,
we are able to obtain doped and undoped PT in the final thin films,
depending on the last rinsing step, but using the same reaction mixtures.
For an improved intermolecular interaction, the thin films of semiconducting
PT are thermally annealed at 200 °C for 10 min right after the
washing procedure.

To investigate the effect of the doping process
occurring during
the film formation step on the nanostructure of the final PT films,
we vary the molar fraction of FeTos 1  with nFeTos and nBT as the amounts of FeTos and BT in the reaction
mixture, respectively. We employ fractions ranging from 0.25 to 0.75.
Afterwards, we investigate the properties of both processing routes
with conducting (acetonitrile-rinsed) and semiconducting (ethanol-rinsed
and annealed) PT films separately. First, we analyze the electronic
and structural properties of the conducting PT films by means of four-point
probe measurements, UV/vis spectroscopy, and grazing incidence wide-angle
X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Thereafter, we show the effect of the process
on the structure (GIWAXS) and the electronic interaction (UV/vis absorbance
and emission spectroscopy) of the semiconducting PT chains.

We performed four-point probe measurements on the conducting PT
films to show that the final doping level is controlled by the amount
of FeTos in the reaction mixture. Figure 1a displays the in-plane electrical conductivities
which we employ as a measure for the doping levels of the films. All
conductivities are in the range of 0.1–0.8 S cm–1 and thereby several orders of magnitude above the conductivity of
semiconducting, undoped PT (10–8–10–4 S cm–1).12,13 Hence, rinsing in acetonitrile
definitely leaves the PT thin films in their doped, conducting state.
The achieved conductivities are of the same dimension as for the doped
PT thin films synthesized in situ with other oxidizing agents.7 Furthermore, the conductivity shows a drastic
increase with increasing molar fraction XFeTos in the reaction mixture.

polythiophene thin
films. (a) In-plane conductivities of films synthesized from the reaction
mixtures with varied molar fractions of FeTos obtained by four-point
probe measurements. (b) Schematic depiction of the proposed lamellar
structure of doped PT and tosylate ions, and the given crystal lattice
distance corresponds to lamellar backbone spacing, orientation of
tosylate according to simulations found in the literature.10 (c) The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS pattern
of films synthesized with FeTos molar fractions of 0.33 (FeTos deficiency)
and 0.75 (FeTos excess), Bragg diffraction of lamellar ordering is
encircled in white.

While it is around 0.1
S cm–1 for low XFeTos (0.25 and 0.33), it rises up to 0.8 S
cm–1 beyond a fraction of 0.5. Thus, we divide the
investigated films into two different regimes. The films prepared
from the reaction mixtures with XFeTos below 0.5 are from now on referred to as synthesized under iron
deficiency, as they show a strongly decreased doping level in comparison
to those synthesized under iron excess (XFeTos larger than 0.5). This is additionally supported by the UV/vis absorbance
spectra of the conducting thin films (see Figure S1), which show a strong rise in the absorbance band of the
doped thiophene chromophores with respect to the π–π*
absorbance band of the undoped molecules with increasing XFeTos, supporting that the increased conductivity is indeed
caused by a higher fraction of oxidized thiophenes and not, for example,
by a change in film quality or polymer chain length.

We investigate
the structural effect of the doping level on the
thin film morphology by performing GIWAXS measurements. Figure 1c shows the obtained 2D images
of the conducting films obtained from the reaction mixtures with XFeTos of 0.33 and 0.75, respectively. Both scattering
patterns exhibit two broad signals centered at q =
1.4 and 1.8 Å–1 (real space distances d = 4.5 and 3.5 Å). These peaks are in agreement with
what has been observed for doped, conducting PT synthesized via an
oxidative polymerization e.g., as nanoparticles or in bulk.14−16 At a high doping level (XFeTos = 0.75),
however, an additional Bragg signal arises at q =
0.77 Å–1 (d = 8.2 Å),
implying the development of an additional new crystal plane. Yamamoto
et al. first found that the bulk PT changes its packing motif beyond
a critical level of doping with iodine.16 According to their findings, a high dopant concentration results
in a structural rearrangement of the molecules. The polythiophene
backbones arrange in a π-stacked fashion, with the planar molecules
parallel to each other. A lamellar structure evolves, in which the
dopant molecules are located in between these PT π-stacks. Later,
this effect has been explained by the tendency of oligothiophene cations
to form π-stacked dimers.17,18 These dimers develop
a chemical bond between the two parallel-arranged backbones, resulting
in an additional stabilization of the positive charges. If a large
number of positively charged oligothiophenes is present in a system,
they even form π-stacked crystal structures.17,18 Chaalane et al. performed density functional theory calculations
of tosylate-doped oligothiophenes to predict the orientation of the
tosylate anions with respect to the polymer backbones. They found
the sidewise arrangement to be most stable, with an intermolecular
distance of 3.56 Å between the sulfur atoms of polythiophene
and tosylate, respectively.10 Therefore,
we propose the formation of a similar crystal structure for the PT
thin films synthesized under iron excess in our study. The highly
doped PT chains arrange in a lamellar structure, giving rise to the
new Bragg peak arising in the GIWAXS pattern for XFeTos = 0.75. It is therefore assigned to a lamellar distance
of 8.2 Å between the polythiophene layers, with tosylate anions
sandwiched in between as depicted in Figure 1b.

In the following, we discuss the
structure and properties of the
semiconducting PT films obtained from the same synthesis by subsequent
rinsing with ethanol. Usually, semiconducting native PT is known to
exhibit only a short-range order, with the backbones aggregating in
a herringbone (HB) fashion as displayed in Figure 2d. The HB packing motif, induced by the electrostatic
repulsion of the π-orbitals, leads to a poor overlap of the
π-orbitals. Therefore, the intermolecular electronic interaction
in unsubstituted PT is weak when compared to its substituted, π-stacked
derivatives such as P3HT.

polythiophene
thin films. (a) Two-dimensional GIWAXS scattering pattern of films
obtained with FeTos molar fractions of 0.33 (FeTos deficiency) and
0.75 (FeTos excess). (b) Radially integrated scattering intensity
in the vertical and (c) horizontal directions. The marked peaks correspond
to the π-stacked crystal structure. (d) Schematic depiction
of the two crystal structures of the semiconducting PT: herringbone
(green box) and π-stacking (beige box).

Figure 2a
shows
the 2D GIWAXS images we measured for semiconducting PT films synthesized
under iron deficiency (XFeTos = 0.33,
left image) and strong iron excess (XFeTos = 0.75, right image), respectively. Both patterns show three sharp
rings at scattering vectors q = 1.40, 1.63, and 1.98
Å–1. While these rings are isotropic for XFeTos = 0.33, meaning the crystallites have
no favored orientation with respect to the sample surface, they show
a strong anisotropy in the case of XFeTos = 0.75. Here, the peak intensity is increased in a vertical direction.
On the basis of the positions of the rings, we assign them to the
main Bragg peaks of polythiophene HB crystals.16,19,20 Since these peaks are assigned to lattice
distances perpendicular to the backbone axis, the anisotropy in the
excess film is interpreted as HB crystallites with polymer backbones
oriented preferably parallel to the substrate plane.12,21

For further analysis of the crystal structures, we radially
integrate
the intensities of the GIWAXS pattern in vertical (Figure 2b) and horizontal directions
(Figure 2c). The vertical
cuts of both samples show the three distinct peaks, which match the
HB crystal structure. Additionally, a small peak arises at q = 1.08 Å–1 (d =
5.8 Å) when iron excess is employed in the synthesis. In the
horizontal cuts there is an even larger difference between the two
samples. In the horizontal direction, the PT synthesized with XFeTos = 0.75 exhibits a new peak at approximately q = 1.76 Å–1 (d =
3.6 Å). From these two new peaks, we conclude that an additional
crystal structure is present in the PT thin films for iron excess.
On the one hand, the three most prominent peaks of both samples fit
to the natural herringbone structure that is known for unsubstituted
polythiophene. For PT synthesized under iron deficiency, this seems
to be the only crystal structure present within the final semiconducting
film. The second sample, prepared under iron excess, on the other
hand, shows two additional peaks, one in each of the respective cuts,
which is present after washing out the tosylate ions and annealing
the film. From the examination of the conducting films, we know that
the samples with iron excess contain π-stacked PT structures
forming a lamellar structure with the tosylate ions. Since the processing
prior to the washing is identical, we analogously propose a π-stacked
structure for the semiconducting PT. The detected new lattice distance
of 3.6 Å is close to the calculated intermolecular distance for
tosylate-doped oligothiophenes (3.7 Å)10 and also in the same range as the π-stacking distances of
both P3HT (3.8 Å)22 and PEDOT (3.4
Å).23 The small peak arising in the
vertical direction is consequently interpreted as the side-by-side
distance between the backbones. Hence, the difference between the
lamellar spacing in the conducting PT processed with iron excess (8.2
Å) and the backbone distance in the semiconducting PT processed
with iron excess (5.8 Å) must arise from the removal of the tosylate
ion in the ethanol-washing process and a resulting shrinkage of the
intermolecular distance. The proposed crystal structure is schematically
displayed in Figure 2d.

To our knowledge, this is the first reported π-stacked
crystal
structure of undoped, semiconducting, unsubstituted polythiophene.
The GIWAXS data clearly show that in the presented processing route
the doping of the polymer backbones during the film formation has
a strong effect on the resulting PT thin film structure. Beyond a
critical level of doping, the polymer chains rearrange into a lamellar
structure of alternating cationic PT π-stacks and layers of
tosylate counter ions in between. However, contrary to the findings
of Yamamoto et al. for bulk PT, the induced π-stacking stays
intact after the tosylate is removed by rinsing with ethanol. The
π-stacked crystal structure is maintained even after thermal
annealing at 200 °C, indicating a certain stability. Using molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, we can confirm the feasibility of the discussed
structures of PT without the presence of tosylate. We simulate a crystal
of 100 PT 10-mers. The calculations show that if the PT chains are
constrained to the crystal plane separations observed in the experiment
(5.8 and 3.6 Å), but are nevertheless free in rotation around
the backbone, all the PT chains tilt in the same direction and form
π-stacks. When removing the constraints, the vertical PT stacks
slide in position and tilt in an alternating fashion, resulting in
a typical herringbone structure with the calculated separations (unit
cell parameters a = 7.10 Å and b = 5.71 Å) agreeing well with the experimental values here and
in the literature (a = 7.81 Å and b = 5.56 Å).19,20 This indicates that the herringbone
structure exhibits a strong global minimum, while a π-stacked
structure is possible if the movement of the polymer chains is prevented
due to the polymer chains being embedded in the densely packed films
(see Figure S2).

Finally, we perform
absorbance and emission spectroscopy measurements
on the semiconducting thin films to investigate the effect of the
altered crystal structure on the intermolecular interaction of the
PT chains. Figure 3 shows the spectra of the semiconducting PT films. The UV/vis absorbance
of all investigated thin films expands from the ultraviolet region
to beyond 600 nm. As the plot shows, the maximum of the absorbance
shifts from 465 to 500 nm for PT synthesized under iron excess. Moreover,
the intensity decreases in the low wavelength region, while the intensity
of the shoulders increases at higher wavelengths. We assume that the
absorption properties of PT are very similar to those of the well-investigated
P3HT, since their backbones are composed of the same thiophene chromophores.
Therefore, we can interpret the spectra as a superposition of the
amorphous contributions of the disordered PT chains in the higher
energy section and the vibronic transitions of the aggregated thiophene
chromophores of elongated, ordered polymer chains at higher wavelengths.24 Hence, the fraction of ordered PT backbones
in the films increased when synthesized under iron excess.

Figure 3 Normalized
absorbance and emission spectra of semiconducting PT
films polymerized in situ with varied molar fractions of FeTos (see
legend). Each absorbance spectrum is normalized to its respective
maximum, emission spectra are normalized to the intensity of the 0−1
transition. Arrows indicate a decrease in amorphous contributions
and an increase of vibronic transitions in the absorbance spectra
and a decrease of the 0–1 transition in the emission spectra.
Excitation wavelength for all emission measurements is 500 nm.

Moreover, the relative increase
of the vibronic shoulders compared
to the amorphous contribution induces the shift of the absorbance
maximum, although the positions of the single absorbance bands seem
to remain unchanged. Thus, the chemical constitution of the semiconducting
polymers is not altered by the different synthetic parameters.

The emission spectra give further insight into the character of
the chromophore interaction. All spectra exhibit the most intense
emission band at around 620 nm and a second strong emission at 670
nm. With increasing fraction of FeTos, the relative intensity of the
first band decreases. Moreover, the spectra are slightly redshifted
at higher fractions. The energy of the different emissions as well
as the ratio between the single emission bands is comparable to those
of aggregated but not fully crystallized P3HT, with the thiophene
chromophores surrounded by the π-system of the other backbones.24 This is plausible, as PT is the backbone of
P3HT and therefore features very similar electronic properties. The
decreasing ratio of the 0–0 to 0–1 emission is a clear
indication of an increased order within the films. The redshift on
the other hand suggests an increased interaction between the chromophores
of neighboring polymer chains. Therefore, the synthesis under iron
excess appears to have two effects: firstly, the overall order within
the thin film increased, while secondly, the new π-stacked crystal
structure results in an increased intermolecular interaction between
the backbones compared to the purely HB packed PT.25,26

Combining the results of the four-point probe measurements,
the
GIWAXS data and spectroscopic analysis, we draw a model of how the
doping process influences the crystal structure of the in situ polymerized
PT. Figure 4 schematically
depicts the processes of the BT polymerization and the following doping
as well as the resulting crystal structures of the differently doped
chains. In the first part of the film forming process, the monomers
are oxidized by the iron ions and subsequently polymerize. Although
the oligothiophenes become insoluble beyond a certain chain length,
they still possess enough mobility to undergo additional oxidation
by excess iron. Therefore, it is possible to control the resulting
doping level by variation of the molar fraction of FeTos in the reaction
mixture. Beyond a critical doping level, the doped polythiophene chains
form cationic π-stacks. In the final doped films obtained after
acetonitrile rinsing, these are arranged in a layered structure with
layers of the tosylate counter ions in between. Opposite to that,
the undoped chains aggregate in their natural HB motif. After dedoping
and removal of the tosylate ions from the highly doped chains, the
PT chains originally in the lamellar configuration retain their π-stacking
motif, despite it usually not being their equilibrium crystal structure.

structures present in PT films synthesized with FeTos. The two-step
process of BT polymerization and subsequent doping with excess FeTos,
which results in semiconducting PT chains aggregating in the herringbone
motif, while highly doped PT arranges into π-stacked lamellae.
Finally, dedoping of the lamellae results in a stable π-stacked,
semiconducting PT crystal structure.

In summary, we presented a solution-based in situ polymerization
process for unsubstituted semiconducting polymers that offers the
possibility to exploit the involved doping process for influencing
the type of crystal structure and aggregation of the polymer chains.
We show that upon variation of the amount of oxidizing agent in the
reaction mixture, the level of doping of the resulting films can be
tuned. Aside from an increase in conductivity of the resulting conducting
PT films, we are also able to show that an increased doping level
has a sustainable impact on the structure. The GIWAXS measurements
confirm the formation of a π-stacked lamellar structure beyond
a critical level of doping. This π-stacking of the PT backbones
is preserved in the crystallites even after dedoping and removal of
the tosylate counter ions. This results in a new crystal structure
of unsubstituted semiconducting polythiophene and, as shown by the
spectroscopic analysis, in an increased intermolecular interaction.
Here, native polythiophene (PT) serves as a model polymer for this
process, which should be transferable to other conjugated polymers
of similar chemical architecture.

Methods
Thin Film Preparation
The in situ polymerization was
performed by spin coating the metastable reaction mixture of 2,2′-bithiophene
(Alfa Aesar) and iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate hexahydrate
(Aldrich) in 1-propanol (synthesis grade, Roth). The precleaned glass
substrates were coated with thin layers of polypropylene (Aldrich)
by spin coating from 1-chlorobenzene (synthesis grade, Roth) to increase
the adhesion of the polythiophene films during the posttreatment steps.
All chemicals involved were used without further purification. The
metastable reaction mixture was spin coated with 2000 rpm for 60 s
at a substrate temperature of 90 °C. Afterwards, the films were
rinsed in either acetonitrile (doped polythiophene films) or ethanol
(undoped polythiophene) for 30 min. Finally, the undoped PT films
were annealed at 200 °C for 10 min in ambient atmosphere. For
each experiment, the sum of the molar concentrations of PT and FeTos
in the reaction mixture was kept constant upon variation of the ratio
between them. Nevertheless, the overall concentration was set to match
the resulting thickness required for each experimental method.

Four-Point
Probe Measurements
The voltage was detected
for a current sweep between 1.0 and −1.0 μA, the sheet
resistance was obtained by linear regression. The film thickness necessary
for the conductivity calculation was determined by profilometry. The
concentration of the reaction mixtures was 0.2 mol L–1.

Grazing Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering
The GIWAXS
measurements were performed at the beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced
Light Source with an X-ray wavelength of λ = 0.124 nm (energy
of 10 keV).27 The scattered intensity was
detected with a Pilatus 2D detector at a sample-to-detector distance
of 299 mm. The incident angle between the beam and the sample was
0.16°. The solid angle corrected 2D pattern as well as the radially
integrated intensities were obtained with the GIXSGUI 1.6 software
of Argonne National Laboratory, taking into account the necessary
corrections.28 The concentration of the
reaction mixtures was set to 0.7 mol L–1.

UV/vis
Spectroscopy
The absorbance was obtained by
performing transmission and reflection measurements with an integrating
sphere. The luminescence spectra were obtained by spin coating onto
polypropylene coated silicon substrates and measured in reflection.
All emission spectra were measured with an excitation wavelength of
500 nm. The concentration for both experiments was 0.2 mol L–1.

MD Simulations
Molecular dynamics simulations were
performed with Gromacs using the Gromos 53a6 force field.29,30 For the simulations, united-atom force field topologies were used,
and the visual analysis of the molecular structure and trajectories
was carried out with VMD.31 The structure
file for the model of a PT 10-mer was generated with JME,32 based on which a force field file was created
using the Automated Force Field Topology Builder and Repository.33 We enhanced the model by calculating partial
charge distribution and the potential energy surface (PES) of the
dihedrals between individual thiophene rings ourselves with Gaussian
09, rev. E.01.34 We used the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p)
level for theory in all quantum chemical calculations. Tight convergence
criteria were requested in geometry optimization. We utilized the
symmetry of the molecule, so that the PES for the first dihedral was
also used for the last and so on. We adjusted the model used for MD
simulations to replicate the PES calculated by the quantum chemical
calculations by rotating the molecule around the angle in question
with enforced rotation. The potential energy of this process was determined
with the Gromacs tool gmx energy. We implemented the new dihedrals
with Ryckaert–Bellemans potentials.35 Simulations were performed locally and on the Jureca Supercomputer.36 Further information on the model system is given
in the Supporting Information.
