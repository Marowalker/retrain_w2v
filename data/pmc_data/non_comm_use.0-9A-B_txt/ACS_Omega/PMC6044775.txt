Amyloid
peptides can misfold and aggregate into amyloid oligomers
and fibrils containing conformationally similar β-sheet structures,
which are linked to the pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative
diseases. These β-sheet-rich amyloid aggregates provide common
structural motifs to accelerate amyloid formation by acting as seeds.
However, little is known about how one amyloid peptide aggregation
will affect another one (namely, cross-seeding). In this work, we
studied the cross-seeding possibility and efficiency between rat islet
amyloid polypeptide (rIAPP) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP)
solution with preformed aggregates at different aggregation phases,
using a combination of different biophysical techniques. hIAPP is
a well-known peptide hormone that forms amyloid fibrils and induces
cytotoxicity to β-cells in type 2 diabetes, whereas rIAPP is
a nonaggregating and nontoxic peptide. Experimental results showed
that all different preformed hIAPP aggregates can cross-seed rIAPP
to promote the final fibril formation but exhibit different cross-seeding
efficiencies. Evidently, hIAPP seeds preformed at a growth phase show
the strongest cross-seeding potential to rIAPP, which accelerates
the conformational transition from random structures to β-sheet
and the aggregation process at the fibrillization stage. Homoseeding
of hIAPP is more efficient in initiating and promoting aggregation
than cross-seeding of hIAPP and rIAPP. Moreover, the cross-seeding
of rIAPP with hIAPP at the lag phase also reduced cell viability,
probably because of the formation of more toxic hybrid oligomers at
the prolonged lag phase. The cross-seeding effects in this work may
add new insights into the mechanistic understanding of the aggregation
and coaggregation of amyloid peptides linked to different neurodegenerative
diseases.

Introduction
Misfolding and aggregation of human islet
amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP,
also known as amylin) into amyloid fibrils, followed by subsequent
deposition of these amyloid fibrils into pancreatic islets, are the
neuropathological hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D).1 hIAPP is a 37-residue peptide hormone synthesized by the
pancreatic β-cells with physiological circulating concentrations
ranging from 1.6 to 20 pM in nondiabetic people.2 Amyloid formation by hIAPP is believed to be associated
with β-cell death and dysfunction, the failure of islet transplantation,
and the development of T2D. The hIAPP fibrillization process usually
exhibits a typical three-stage sigmoidal kinetics,3−5 starting with
a lag phase where hIAPP monomers slowly accumulate into small seeds
(commonly termed as small nucleus), followed by a growth phase where
the small seeds act as catalysts to interact with monomers and rapidly
grow into larger aggregates via peptide addition, and finally reaching
an equilibrium phase where most of the aggregates convert into mature
fibrils.6−8 hIAPP aggregates not only increase their sizes and
change their morphologies with time but also undergo the complex structural
transition from random coil → α-helix → β-sheet
with an increase in the β-sheet content.9,10 Because
the formation of nucleus seeds is a rate-determining step for hIAPP
aggregation, the hIAPP fibrillization process is modeled using a seeding-dependent
aggregation mechanism. This mechanism is also a general feature of
amyloid formation by other amyloid peptides (e.g., Aβ, α-synuclein,
and tau protein).11 Moreover, small hIAPP
seeds are often found to be highly toxic to cultured pancreatic islet
β-cells and to islets.12,13 Therefore, the study
of seeding-induced amyloid aggregation and toxicity mechanisms is
fundamentally and (pre)clinically important for therapeutic and prevention
strategies against T2D.

In general, seeding a protein/peptide
solution with preformed homogeneous
aggregates can dramatically change (usually enhance) the growth rate
of amyloids. Jarrett et al.12,13 conducted comparative
kinetic studies of Aβ aggregation to demonstrate their nucleation-dependent
polymerization mechanisms. They found that the addition of Aβ
preformed fibrils into initially soluble Aβ solutions eliminated
the nucleation time and thus led to a rapid aggregation. Kayed et
al.14 utilized a variety of biochemical
methods to study the nucleation–polymerization process for
hIAPP amyloid formation in the presence of the preformed hIAPP seeds.
Come et al.15 studied the aggregation of
a fragment of the prion protein (PrP) containing residues 96–111
in the absence and presence of PrP96–111 seeds.
The seeded groups significantly reduced the lag-phase time and promoted
fibril formation. All of these in vitro studies showed that the preformed
homologous seeds indeed accelerate amyloid formation through bypassing
the lag phase.16

In vivo studies
further confirmed that amyloid proteins/peptides
can spread the pathology between cells and tissues, and in some cases,
they stimulate the disorder features when implemented into animal
models through homogeneous seeding.17 Luk
et al.18,19 found that an inoculation of synthetic α-synuclein
fibrils into wild-type mice can elicit a massive formation and subsequent
cell-to-cell transmission of pathological α-synuclein via the
murine central nervous system. Consequently, such amyloid pathology
accumulation generated a progressive loss of neurons and culminated
in motor deficit in originally healthy mice. Kane et al.20 performed the seeding experiment by injecting
Alzheimer brain extracts intracerebrally into the Aβ precursor
protein (APP) transgenic mice. A sharp contrast between the profuse
presence of Aβ plaques in a tissue-injected mice group and the
nonexistence of Aβ deposits in an uninjected mice group showed
that Aβ can be seeded in vivo. Holmes et al.21 developed a Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based
biosensor to study the onset and progression of tau pathology using
tau seeds in transgenic mice. They found that tau seeds can transmit
from cell to cell via neural connections. All of these in vivo data
indicated that seeding likely acted as an infectious agent to self-propagate
different amyloid diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD),20 Parkinson disease,18 and tauopathies.21

In a broader
view, the seeding process could be homologous or heterologous.
Several studies22−24 reported the binding and coaggregation of different
amyloid peptides, a process known as cross-seeding. Because most of
the amyloid peptides share similar aggregation kinetics and structures,
it is possible that amyloid seeding induces both homologous and heterologous
amyloid formation. For example, α-synuclein fibrils could induce
tau aggregation25,26 in AD22,23 and huntingtin aggregation in Huntington disease.27 Similarly, intravenous injection of preformed fibrils of
hIAPP or Aβ into hIAPP transgenic mice can act as seeds to stimulate
hIAPP amyloids in the islet of Langerhans, and this finding supports
that both seeding and cross-seeding can occur at local islets via
blood.26 To clarify the molecular requirements
for peptide compatibility and the mechanisms behind them, a range
of amyloid peptides were paired to study their cross-seeding behaviors
in vitro. Kapurniotu and co-workers28,29 studied the
aggregation kinetics of amyloid fibrils formed by pure Aβ40, pure hIAPP, and mixtures of both peptides at a molar ratio
of 1:1. They found that both nucleation and fibrillization of Aβ–hIAPP
mixtures were delayed as compared with the aggregation kinetics of
pure Aβ or pure hIAPP. They concluded that the cross-seeding
of Aβ–hIAPP and the homoseeding of Aβ and hIAPP
likely occur in a competitive manner. Mandal et al.30 performed multidimensional NMR to study the interaction
between Aβ and α-synuclein in a membrane-mimic environment.
Aβ and α-synuclein appeared to strongly interact with
each other and mutually promote their respective amyloid fibrillization.
Giasson et al.31 also observed that the
coincubation of α-synuclein and tau led to a synergistic fibrillization
promotion of both peptides. Growing evidence from clinical studies32,33 also showed the coexistence of different amyloid protein aggregates
in one disease and of different amyloid diseases in the same individual,
suggesting a direct interaction between different amyloid peptides.34

On the other hand, not any two different
amyloid peptides can cross-seed
each other. Aβ fibrils efficiently cross-seeded hIAPP in solution,
whereas hIAPP fibrils did not cross-seed Aβ effectively, with
only 2% of cross-seeding efficiency.35 Similarly,
transthyretin decreased Aβ deposition and suppressed cognitive
deficits in AD mouse models.36,37 It seems that the cross-seeding
efficiency depends on the structural similarity between seeds and
the other amyloid aggregates. It is likely that targeting peptides
adopt a structure, at least partially identical to seeds, for amyloid
growth. Although the results collected from literature point to the
more complex mechanisms for amyloid cross-seeding, which remain to
be answered, they also suggest that the cross-seeding is generally
specific, and some cross-seeding barriers could exist because of the
mismatch of sequences and structures between different amyloid peptides.

Completely different from hIAPP, rIAPP does not form amyloid peptides
and is nontoxic to β-cells, although rIAPP differs from hIAPP
only at six residues (H18R, F23L, A25P, I26V, S28P, and S29P)38 (Scheme 1). Our previous molecular dynamics simulation39,40 showed that hIAPP and rIAPP can interact with each other to form
hybrid structures via peptide elongation and lateral association.
An exploration into this contrast amyloidogenic property between two
nearly same sequences could be a big step toward a better understanding
of amyloidosis and finding potential amyloid-prevention methods. In
our previous work,41 we studied the cross-sequence
interaction between full-length hIAPP37 and rIAPP37. Our previous data showed that when coincubating rIAPP37 with hIAPP37, both in freshly prepared monomer states,
rIAPP initially inhibited hIAPP aggregation at both lag and growth
phases, but once the aggregation-promoting hIAPP nuclei or oligomers
were formed, they could recruit and cross-seed rIAPP to promote final
fibril formation. However, little is known about how different hIAPP
seeds interact with rIAPP and about the toxicity of hIAPP/rIAPP complexes. Different from our previous work, here, we studied the homoseeding
of hIAPP and the cross-seeding of rIAPP with preformed hIAPP seeds
at different aggregation stages using combined experimental methods.
The results showed that hIAPP seeds formed at different stages can
not only seed hIAPP but can also cross-seed rIAPP, but the homologous
seeding of hIAPP itself was more effective than the heterologous seeding
of hIAPP with rIAPP. The different seeding and cross-seeding efficiencies
also reflect a fact that there exists a cross-seeding barrier probably
due to the mismatch of cross-seeding structures.

Results and Discussion
Cross-Seeding of rIAPP
and Homoseeding of hIAPP by Different
hIAPP Seeds
Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence aggregation assays
were used to assess the seeding of hIAPP and the cross-seeding of
rIAPP in the presence of different preformed hIAPP aggregates. The
assays were performed by adding freshly prepared hIAPP (25 μM)
or rIAPP (25 μM) to the ongoing incubation (preaggregated) hIAPP
solution (25 μM) at different time points (0, 2, 6, 10, and
14 h). This design is equivalent to using different hIAPP seeds formed
at three different aggregation stages to seed the same species of
hIAPP or cross-seed different species of rIAPP. ThT fluorescence intensities
(excitation at 450 nm and emission at 490 ± 10 nm) were recorded
every 2 h to monitor aggregate formation. As a control, pure hIAPP
aggregation exhibited a typical sigmoidal nucleation–polymerization
curve, starting with a lag phase of 0–4 h, followed by a rapid
growth phase from 4–20 h, and ending at a stable plateau with
a maximum ThT intensity of ∼52 after 20 h. Pure rIAPP under
the same incubation conditions did not aggregate in solution, as evidenced
by the absence of any ThT signal.41

First, we studied the cross-seeding behavior of rIAPP in the presence
of different hIAPP seeds obtained from the nucleation, growth, and
final equilibrium phases. Figure 1a (red line) shows that when coincubating both freshly
prepared hIAPP (25 μM) and rIAPP (25 μM) together at 0
h, the lag time was prolonged to ∼6 h, whereas the growth rate
was almost unchanged between 6 and 10 h and then increased after 10
h. Finally, the maximal ThT intensity reached a stable plateau of
∼61, which is ∼22.2% higher than that of pure hIAPP
without adding rIAPP. Similarly, adding rIAPP to a seeded hIAPP solution
at 2 h also increased the lag time to 5 h and promoted fibril formation
with the maximum ThT intensity of ∼64 (Figure 1b). This result indicates that the introduction
of rIAPP to the hIAPP solution at the nucleation stage slows down
the seed formation and early aggregation of hIAPP, but once hIAPP
seeds are formed, they can cross-seed rIAPP to form more fibrils.
Then, we examined the cross-seeding of rIAPP using the hIAPP seed
solution at the growth phase. In Figure 1c, 15 min after the addition of rIAPP to
the 6-h-seeded hIAPP solutions, the aggregation rate was accelerated,
as indicated by immediate ThT signal enhancement followed by a deeper
slope at the growth phase. A similar burst of cross-seeding was also
observed when adding rIAPP to a 10-h-seeded hIAPP solution, but the
growth rate seemed not to change much (Figure 1d). Finally, when adding rIAPP to the preformed
hIAPP fibrils at a final plateau stage of 14 h, the cross-seeding
between rIAPP and hIAPP still occurred, but the acceleration of aggregation
was much less than those found for preformed hIAPP aggregates at the
nucleation and growth phases (Figure 1e), indicating that hIAPP aggregated states before
the formation of large hIAPP fibrils are the major causative agent
of cross-seeding. Moreover, in all cross-seeding tests containing
the same amount of hIAPP and rIAPP (25 μM), because rIAPP alone
does not aggregate and form amyloid fibrils, during the cross-seeding
process, any increase in the final ThT intensity does not result from
hIAPP fibrils alone but instead results from new hybrid hIAPP/rIAPP
fibrils.

by adding freshly prepared rIAPP (25 μM) to different hIAPP
seeds preform at different time points, and homoseeding by adding
freshly prepared hIAPP (25 μM) to different hIAPP seeds preform
at different time points of (a) 0 h, (b) 2 h, (c) 6 h, (d) 10 h, and
(e) 14 h, respectively. Arrows indicate the time point to add freshly
prepared hIAPP or rIAPP. Error bars represent the average of three
replicate experiments.

To further quantitatively compare the cross-seeding efficiency
induced by different hIAPP seeds that were preformed at different
aggregation stages, we summarized the increase in final ThT intensities
for all cross-seeding tests relative to the final ThT intensity of
pure hIAPP alone. As shown in Table 1, different preformed hIAPP aggregates can all cross-seed
rIAPP to promote final fibril formation but they also exhibited different
cross-seeding efficiencies. hIAPP aggregates, which were preformed
at a growth phase of ∼6 h, showed the strongest cross-seeding
potential to rIAPP. Evidently, the coaggregation and the cofibrillization
of hIAPP and rIAPP were accelerated, leading to a 36.2% increase in
amyloid fibrils, as reflected by the final ThT intensity enhancement.
The cross-seeding between freshly prepared rIAPP and hIAPP aggregates
preformed at the nucleation phase still led to 22–29% increase
in the total amount of amyloid fibrils. Early hIAPP aggregates may
contain more disordered structures, so the cross-seeding activities
were reduced because of a greater extent of structural mismatch between
hIAPP seeds and rIAPP. This is also confirmed by the delay of lag
phase due to cross-seeding, where the introduction of rIAPP clearly
interferes with the nuclei formation of hIAPP. Using hIAPP (proto)fibrils
as the seeds where β-sheet structures dominate, the cross-seeding
activity was not as effective as the optimal one. It is possible that
hIAPP protofibrils or fibrils offer fewer active surface sites, particularly
hydrophobic aggregation sites, to interact with rIAPP because these
active sites have already been preoccupied by hIAPP.

curves in Figure 1.

monomers (25 μM) were added to the pure hIAPP solution (25 μM)
seeded at different time points of 0–14 h.

c Using the 0–4 h of pure hIAPP
aggregation as a lag phase, the addition of rIAPP (hIAPP) monomer
to the seeded hIAPP solution induces the increase (decrease) of the
lag phase.

d Using the final
ThT plateau of pure
hIAPP aggregation as an indicator of fibrils being formed, the addition
of rIAPP (hIAPP) monomer to all seeded hIAPP solution induces the
increase in final fibril formation.

In parallel, we also examined the seeding behavior
of hIAPP for
comparison using the same cross-seeding protocols and conditions.
We added freshly prepared hIAPP monomers to hIAPP solutions seeded
at different times and then monitored the aggregation kinetics changes
before and after adding hIAPP monomers by recording ThT signals. In Figure 1a, the addition of
25 μM hIAPP to another 25 μM hIAPP solution at 0 h is
equivalent to the incubation of freshly prepared 50 μM hIAPP
monomers at 0 h, whose aggregation curve should be different from
that of 25 μM hIAPP itself, as shown in Figure 1a. As compared to a control group of 25 μM
hIAPP, the double concentration group of 25 hIAPP + 25 hIAPP (50 μM)
exhibited faster nucleation at the lag phase and more fibrils being
formed at the final phase. Moreover, homoseeding in the 25 hIAPP +
25 hIAPP group is more efficient than cross-seeding in the 25 hIAPP
+ 25 rIAPP group. In both cases of the homoseeding initiated at the
nucleation phase, the hIAPP aggregation showed faster kinetics with
a short lag phase of 2 h. This is different from cross-seeding that
leads to a prolonged lag phase. In the other cases of mixing hIAPP
monomers with preformed hIAPP seeds at the growth and equilibrium
phases, there were immediate burst aggregations, followed by a faster
aggregation to achieve higher ThT plateaus. These home-seeding data
showed trends similar to the cross-seeding data, but the final ThT
intensities of homoseeding mixtures were always higher than those
of cross-seeding mixtures at the same peptide concentrations. It is
also possible that both coaggregation and homoseeding can occur at
the same time, leading to a faster aggregation process. Moreover,
we also found that there were no statistical differences in the final
ThT intensity for all homoseeding groups, which is another distinctive
feature between hIAPP homoseeding and hIAPP/rIAPP cross-seeding. The
homoseeding efficiency of hIAPP itself appears not to be necessarily
relied on the preaggregated state of homoseeds, although its seeding-induced
aggregation rate still does. By contrast, the cross-seeding process
involves a critical step for rIAPP being converted into an amyloidlike
structure, and this transformation is believed to largely depend on
the hIAPP-seed condition. From the sequence perspective, the high amyloidogenic property of the hIAPP (20–29)
region has been demonstrated. Peptide fragments from this hIAPP (20-29),
for example, 22NFGAILSS29,4222NFGAIL27,43 and 24GAILSS2944 can independently assemble into amyloid fibrils similar to full-length
hIAPP fibrils. Differently, for the rIAPP peptide, the presence of
three proline residues located in the 24–29 region (GPVLPP)
is believed to disrupt the amyloidogenic property and reduce the β-sheet
formation.45,46 The presence of hIAPP seeds may
alter the folding pathway of rIAPP and drive rIAPP to be incorporated
into hIAPP seeds. It is also possible that the N-terminal β-sheet
of hIAPP aggregates could serve as a template interface either to
recruit and accommodate rIAPP with a conformationally similar N-terminal
β-sheet (not the C-terminal 20–29 region) or to facilitate
the structural transition of rIAPP to partially fold into compatible
β-sheet structures.

A comparison of homoseeding and cross-seeding
ThT data reveals
some similarities and differences. First, hIAPP at different aggregation
phases can always seed hIAPP monomers and cross-seed rIAPP monomers,
but the homoseeding/cross-seeding efficacies seem to be more dependent
on the aggregation-prone intermediate species. The population of hIAPP
intermediate species, not those species at the initial nucleation
and final equilibrate phases, is more critical to achieve high coaggregation
and homo-/cross-seeding. These hIAPP intermediate species are largely
partially folded with some solvent-exposed hydrophobic moieties that
promote intermolecular interactions with hIAPP or rIAPP. Second, homoseeding
is more efficient in initiating and promoting aggregation than cross-seeding.
This is not surprising because mismatch sequences between hIAPP and
rIAPP increases energy barriers for efficient cross-interactions.

Cross-Seeding Induces Structural Changes in Amyloid Aggregates
To gain further insights into cross-seeding, we monitored the structural
changes of cross-seeded hIAPP/rIAPP aggregates using atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and circular dichroism (CD) under the exact same
conditions used in ThT tests. Figure 2 shows the representative AFM images of the cross-seeding
of fresh rIAPP monomers with hIAPP solutions seeded for different
times. As a control, AFM images of pure hIAPP aggregation (25 μM)
showed typical amyloid morphologies at different aggregation phases,
confirming the conversion of small oligomers into higher-order amyloid
fibrils. The widths of most hIAPP fibrils were similar and ranged
between 8 and 12 nm. CD spectroscopy images in Figure 3 also showed that pure hIAPP experienced
a typical structural transition from the initial random coil to the
β-sheet structure, as indicated by the appearance of the two
peaks at 195 and 215 nm, both of which corresponds to the β-sheet
structure. For comparison, when coincubating equimolar hIAPP and rIAPP
monomers at 0 h, it is clear that the lag phase was prolonged to 4
h, during which a large amount of spherical aggregates of 1–2
nm diameters were predominated. Therefore, the prolonged lag phase
indicates the occurrence of coaggregation between hIAPP and rIAPP.
After that, short, thin protofibrils and long, thicker mature fibrils
were observed at 8 and 16 h, respectively. Their morphologies were
almost identical to those of pure hIAPP (proto)fibrils. Moreover,
upon cross-seeding rIAPP by preformed hIAPP seeds at different time
points of 2–14 h, AFM images in all cases consistently showed
the morphological changes from small aggregates, low density protofibrils,
to highly dense fibrils, and the final morphologies of cross-seeded
fibrils were found to be similar to those of homoseeded fibrils. Height
profiles obtained from the AFM images showed that all amyloid fibrils
exhibited similar heights of 5–15 nm. The AFM results were
also supported by our recent simulation work39 that hIAPP/rIAPP assemblies reflected a polymorphic nature of cross-seeding
species, that is, hIAPP can cross interact with rIAPP to form hybrid
amyloid aggregates and fibrils via two pathways of peptide elongation
and lateral association.

Figure 2 AFM images for pure hIAPP (25 μM, the
first row) and cross-seeding
of hIAPP (25 μM)/rIAPP (25 μM) captured at different time
points of 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 h. The notation of “hIAPP + rIAPP
at 0, 2, 6, 10, and 14 h” indicates the different time points
to add freshly prepared rIAPP monomers to the seeded hIAPP solution.
The height analysis for the final amyloid fibrils for each group is
also provided.

rIAPP was added to the seeded hIAPP solution at 0, 2, 6, 10, and 14
h. The signals of cross-seeding groups were subtracted by a background
signal produced by pure rIAPP. (b) Final secondary structure distribution
of pure hIAPP (25 μM) and the cross-seeding of hIAPP (25 μM)/rIAPP
(25 μM) using the CDSSTR method.

Additionally, we conducted CD experiments for secondary structure
characterization of the fibrils generated through cross-seeding. Considering
that rIAPP has the same concentration of hIAPP and rIAPP itself mainly
adopts random coil conformations, in the cross-seeding cases studied,
we found that the adsorption spectra of cross-seeding samples were
largely dominated by a strong negative peak at ∼197 nm, corresponding
to major random coil conformations. This makes the other combined
secondary structures difficult to characterize, particularly a characteristic
peak of β-sheet at ∼195 nm. To address this issue, all
raw CD curves of cross-seeding samples recorded at the end of the
reaction (24 h) were corrected by subtracting a control curve of pure
rIAPP. In this way, the corrected curves should present a linear superposition
of hIAPP conformations and transformed rIAPP conformations. In Figure 3, the CD spectrum
of the final hIAPP fibrils showed a positive peak at ∼192 nm
and a negative valley at ∼210 nm, confirming the β-sheet-rich
structure of pure hIAPP. Upon cross-seeding with rIAPP, all corrected
CD curves not only shifted their positive peaks to ∼195 nm
with enhanced magnitude but also deepened the negative peaks. The
continuous shift and the increase in the peaks indicate that cross-seeding
continues to develop β-sheet-rich fibrils. On the basis of the
entire CD spectrum, we performed CDpro analysis to obtain the final
secondary structure content of pure hIAPP and cross-seeded hIAPP/rIAPP
samples using the CDSSTR (Circular dichroism standardized stepwise
treatment regimen) method (Figure 3b). As compared with the pure hIAPP group containing
∼46% of α-helix and ∼30% of β-sheet after
20 h incubation, all cross-seedings of hIAPP/rIAPP groups incubated
at different time points resulted in higher β-sheet of 37–51%
and lower α-helix of ∼31–37%. This suggests that
the cross-seeding of hIAPP/rIAPP induces an increase in β-sheet
content at the expense of structural conversion of α-helical
or random structures. Moreover, considering the two facts that (1)
pure rIAPP peptides do not produce any ThT signal and (2) the same
amount of hIAPP (25 μM) was used in all tested cross-seeding
cases, any increase in the final ThT intensity actually does not result
from hIAPP fibrils but instead results from new hybrid hIAPP/rIAPP
fibrils (Figure 1).
Second, because rIAPP always retains its random coil conformation,
the difference in CD spectrum between the hIAPP/rIAPP mixtures and
pure hIAPP is likely induced by the incorporated rIAPP (Figure 3). Taken together, collective
data from ThT, AFM, and CD analyses confirm the occurrence of cross-seeding
between hIAPP and rIAPP.

Cross-Seeding Increases Cell Toxicity
To examine whether
the cross-seeding aggregates are innocuous, we conducted a cell viability
experiment using the MTT assay with the RIN-m5f cell line (Figure 4). To establish a
baseline, the absorbance of the RIN-m5f cell media alone was measured,
and the value was set as 100% of cells being viable. When incubating pure
hIAPP (25 μM) with cell culture media for 48 h, the cell viability
decreased to 65% of that of the control, confirming that hIAPP aggregates
are toxic to cells. By contrast, pure rIAPP (25 μM) presented
very low cytotoxicity to cells, as evidenced by the 97.5% cell viability
during 48 h of cell culture. In all cross-seeding tests, the cell viability was reduced as compared with that of the
control, but the extent of cell viability showed an increasing trend
as a function of time point for adding rIAPP to the seeded hIAPP solution.
Specifically, when introducing rIAPP to the hIAPP solution at early
aggregation time points of 0, 2, and 6 h, the cross-seeding aggregates
ultimately led to a high toxicity ranging from 58 to 52%. As confirmed
by ThT and AFM, the cross-seeding of rIAPP with hIAPP at the lag phase
(0–2 h) extends the nucleation stage and thus produces the
more predominant oligomers that are highly toxic and also prolongs
their lifetime. In comparison, when using the hIAPP fibrillar aggregates
preformed at the later aggregation stages (14 h) to cross-seed rIAPP,
the cell viability was ∼60%, which was slightly lower than
the 65% cell viability induced by pure hIAPP. It is generally accepted
that small, soluble amyloid oligomers are the most toxic species as
compared with insoluble final amyloid fibrils.47 When adding rIAPP monomers to the preformed hIAPP protofibrils,
hIAPP/rIAPP oligomers are unlikely to form because of the absence
of hIAPP oligomers. Instead, hIAPP protofibrils will recruit rIAPP
monomers to form large hIAPP/rIAPP protofibrils. Such a cross-seeding
effect would reduce the formation of the potential toxic hIAPP/rIAPP
oligomers but promote the formation of less toxic hybrid hIAPP/rIAPP
fibrils, both of which lead to the increase in cell viability.

Conclusions
hIAPP and rIAPP have completely opposite
aggregation propensities,
with only six residue differences in their sequences. hIAPP is known
as the causal agent to induce T2D via its strong aggregation and toxic
properties, whereas rIAPP is not. The cross-seeding of these two different
peptides is fundamentally important for understanding the mechanism
of hIAPP aggregation linked to T2D but remains elusive. To address
this unexplored fundamental issue, here, we have studied the effect
of cross-seeding between rIAPP monomers and different hIAPP seeds
on aggregation kinetics, structure, and toxicity in vitro. In all
cases of cross-seeding, the hIAPP solution containing different preformed
seeds can indeed cross-seed rIAPP to promote final amyloid fibril
formation. But, the cross-seeding activity was strongly depended on
hIAPP seeds. Specifically, hIAPP seeds formed at the growth phase
exhibited the best cross-seeding capacity for rIAPP where the coaggregation
and cofibrillization of hIAPP and rIAPP were accelerated, whereas
hIAPP fibrillar seeds exhibited poor cross-seeding capacity. For the
toxicity tests, all cross-seedings of rIAPP with different hIAPP seeds
induced a higher cell toxicity than pure hIAPP. Particularly, in the
case of using hIAPP seeds formed at the nucleation stage to cross-seed
rIAPP, the lag phase was retarded, which elevated the production of
more toxic intermediates and thus caused the highest cell toxicity.
Moreover, the comparison of homo- and cross-seeding aggregation kinetics
showed that the homoseeding of hIAPP is more efficient to promote
amyloid aggregation than the cross-seeding of hIAPP and rIAPP. This
study demonstrates the cross-seeding between strong-aggregation hIAPP
and nonaggregation rIAPP, which may provide some clues to better understand
the mechanisms of amyloidogenesis.

Methods and Materials
Reagents
1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP, ≥99.9%),
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.9%), 10 mM phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4), 10 mM NaOH, and ThT (98%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). hIAPP (1-37) (≥95.0%) and
rIAPP (1-37) (≥95.0%) were purchased from American Peptide
Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). All other chemicals were of the highest grade
available.

Peptide Purification and Preparation
Both IAPP peptides
were obtained in a lyophilized form and stored at −20 °C
as arrived. To prepare the monomeric peptide solution, 1.0 mg of each
preaggregated peptide was dissolved in HFIP for 2 h, sonicated for
30 min to remove any preexisting aggregates or seeds, and centrifuged
at 14 000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The top peptide (80%)
solution was then extracted, subpackaged, frozen with liquid nitrogen,
and then dried using a freeze-dryer. The dry peptide powder was lyophilized
at −80 °C and used within 1 week. Purified hIAPP powder
(0.2 mg) was aliquoted in 30 μL of 10 mM NaOH solution and sonicated
for 1 min to obtain a homogenous solution. The initiation of hIAPP
(25 μM) aggregation in solution was accomplished by adding 30
μL of the obtained NaOH–hIAPP solution to 2 mL of 10
mM PBS buffer. Then, for the hIAPP/rIAPP solution mixed in different
stages, we used the same protocol to prepare initial pure hIAPP solutions
at the beginning and added 30 μL of fresh NaOH–rIAPP
solutions to each pure hIAPP solution at 0, 2, 6, 10, and 14 h. All
solutions were incubated at 37 °C.

ThT Fluorescence Assay
ThT fluorescence assay is considered
to be a standard method to detect the formation of amyloid fibrils
because ThT can specifically bind to the β-sheet structure of
protein fibrils and gives a strong fluorescence emission. A ThT solution
(2 mM) was prepared by adding 0.033 g of ThT powder into 50 mL of
deionized (DI) water. The resultant 250 μL of the 2 mM ThT solution
was further diluted in 50 mL of Tris buffer (pH = 7.4) to a final
concentration of 10 μM. The peptide solution (60 μL) was
added into the 10 μM ThT–Tris solution (3 mL) at each
time point. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using an LS-55 fluorescence
spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Waltham, MA). All measurements were
carried out in aqueous solution using a 1 × 1 cm2 quartz
cuvette. The ThT fluorescence emission wavelengths were recorded between
470 and 500 nm with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm. Each experiment
was repeated at least three times, and each sample was tested in quintuplicates.

CD Spectroscopy
The secondary structures of hIAPP and
rIAPP in solution were examined by CD spectroscopy using a J-1500
spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Japan) in the continuous scanning
mode at room temperature. Peptide solutions incubated for 20 h (160
μL for each time point) were placed into a rectangular quartz
cuvette of a 1 mm pathlength without dilution. The spectra were recorded
between 250 and 190 nm at a 0.5 nm resolution and a 50 nm/min scan
rate. All spectra were corrected by subtracting the baseline and averaged
by three successive scans for each sample.

Tapping-Mode AFM
The morphology changes of peptides
during fibrillization were monitored by tapping-mode AFM. The sample
(20 μL) used in both ThT fluorescence assay and CD spectrum
test was taken for the AFM measurement at different time points to
correlate the hIAPP or rIAPP morphology changes with their growth
kinetics. A peptide solution was deposited onto a freshly cleaved
mica substrate for 1 min, rinsed three times with 50 mL of DI water
to remove the salts and loosely bound peptide, and dried with compressed
air for 5 min before AFM imaging. Tapping-mode AFM imaging was performed
in air using a Nanoscope III multimode scanning probe microscope (Veeco
Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a 15 μm E scanner. Commercial
Si cantilevers (Nanoscience) with an elastic modulus of 40 N m–1 were used. All images were acquired as 512 ×
512 pixel images at a typical scan rate of 1.0–2.0 Hz with
a vertical-tip oscillation frequency of ∼160 kHz. Representative
AFM images were obtained by scanning at least six different locations
of different samples.

Cell Culture
Rat insulinoma (RIN-m5F)
cells (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) were used as model pancreatic β-cells and cultured
in 75 cm2 T-flasks in sterile-filtered RPMI-1640 medium
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC, Manassas,
VA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The flasks
were incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at
37 °C. Cells were then cultured to confluence and harvested using
a 0.25% Trypsin–EDTA (1×) solution (Lonza, Walkersville,
MD). The cells were counted using a hemocytometer and plated in a
96-well tissue culture plate at 50 000 cells per well in 100
μL of medium, which allow them to attach inside of the incubator
for 24 h.

MTT Toxicity Assay
MTT-based cell toxicity assays were
performed to assess the cytotoxicity of hIAPP and rIAPP assemblies.
A 96-well plate with cells was split into seven groups, with each
group containing 12 replicates. The first group containing cells only
in the medium was used as a positive control. NaOH–hIAPP solutions
diluted by the cell medium were added to groups 2–7 to achieve
the 25 μM final concentrations. The cells were then incubated
for another 48 h. During the first 24 h, we used the same protocol
to prepare NaOH–rIAPP solutions and added them to each pure
hIAPP incubation solution (groups 3–7) at 0, 2, 6, 10, and
14 h. MTT (5 mg) was dissolved in sterile PBS solution (1 mL). Then,
we mixed this MTT–PBS solution with 10 mL of the cell medium.
The original cell medium was removed, and 100 μL of this MTT–PBS-medium
solution was added to each well. The cells were incubated for 4 h
at 37 °C to convert MTT to formazan crystals. After that, the
entire 100 μL of the MTT–PBS-medium solution was removed
from each well. Formazan crystals formed at the bottom of each well
were dissolved by adding 100 μL of DMSO per well and were thoroughly
mixed. The cells were incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C
and mixed again to ensure that the formazan was fully dissolved. The
plates were placed in a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski,
VT), and the absorbance was read at 540 nm to determine the formazan
content. The sample absorbance was then compared with the control
groups to determine cell viability. All statistical data were expressed
as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis of all data
was performed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s
test. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
