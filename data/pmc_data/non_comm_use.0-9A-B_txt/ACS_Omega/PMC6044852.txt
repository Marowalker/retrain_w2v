The convergent and
enantioselective synthesis of a highly potent
human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta agonist is
presented. More specifically, the thiazoline structure, which constitutes
the biosynthetically distinctive core structure of pulicatin (a secondary
metabolite of symbiotic bacteria), was synthesized from a commercially
available and inexpensive chiral pool of l-threonine.

1 Introduction
Pulicatin
A is a secondary metabolite that was recently isolated
from the cone snail-associated symbiotic bacteria, Streptomyces sp. CP32, and possesses a relatively
simple but unique stereogenic 5-methyl-arylthiazoline core (see Figure 1).1 Two similar core structures, namely the aryldihydrothiazole
and the arylthiazole cores, are also present within the pulicatin
series and are of particular importance in the discovery of novel
bioactive scaffolds, as the symbiotic Streptomyces sp. CP32 isolated from Conus pulicarius biosynthesizes small-molecule allelochemicals as a defensive mechanism
in marine bioenvironments.2−4

Figure 1 Structures of pulicatins A, C, D, E, and
F, anithiactins A–C,
and PPAR δ agonists 1 and 2.

In addition, a further class of
arylthiazole derivatives, namely
the anithiactins (Figure 1), was identified from a different marine source, and the
total syntheses of anithiactins A–C were investigated as part
of the ongoing research into the discovery of novel secondary metabolites
from the marine-derived Streptomyces sp.5,6

In the context of drug targets, the
nuclear receptor peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) has recently received
attention as a re-emerging target for the treatment of diseases, such
as metabolic syndromes,7−12 as its activation alters glucose and lipid metabolism through transcriptional
regulation and results in beneficial pharmacological effects.13,14 For example, Endurobol (GW501516, 1, Figure 1) is a well-known effective
and potent PPARδ agonist, which is currently in late-phase clinical
trials.15−18 Because of its highly selective and potent activity compared to
other PPARδ agonists, the development of novel synthetic routes
toward target 1 and its analogs has received growing
attention to allow its use in both structural and biological studies.19−23 Indeed, our group previously reported one of the shortest synthetic
routes toward compound 1 and generated a series of different
analogs with the aim of discovering novel agonists.20

2 Results and Discussion
During the course
of our studies into the investigation of marine-derived
natural products24 and synthetic agonists
toward PPARδ, where we aimed to develop safer and more effective
drug leads, we discovered that the bioactive natural products pulicatins
C–F and anithiactins A–C (see Figure 1) contain the same phenylthiazole core structure
as PPARδ agonist 1.

We also found that pulicatin
A contains a biosynthetically distinctive
thiazoline structure, which is essentially the enantiospecifically
reduced form of the 5′-methylthiazole moiety. Thus, inspired
by the fact that these thiazoline and thiazole analogs are produced
from the same biological system, we designed a novel scaffold consisting
of the stereogenic 4,5-dihydrothiazole core. More specifically, during
our investigations into novel anti-obesity drugs, we synthesized 2 based on the structure of 1.

Previously,
the synthesis of a series of optically pure 2-aryl-4,5-dihydrothiazole
analogs without the 5-methyl substituent was carried out using aryl
nitriles and methyl cysteine as the starting materials, and the antibacterial
activities of these compounds were examined.25 However, to date, neither the enantiospecific synthesis of the 2-aryl-5-methyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole
core nor the extended scaffold 2 has been explored.

Thus, we herein present the first enantiospecific synthesis of
the highly potent PPARδ agonist 2 containing the
novel thiazoline scaffold, in addition to the preliminary in vitro
pharmacological studies of this compound toward PPAR subtypes.

From a synthetic point of view, the main challenge in the preparation
of 2 involves the construction of the two thiazoline
stereocenters. We therefore began the synthesis of 2 from l-threonine (Scheme 1), a readily available and cheap amino acid. Thus, one of
the two stereocenters in the final product originates from l-threonine, whereas the other is constructed during the formation
of the thiazoline ring using either diethylaminosulfur trifluoride
(DAST) or methyl N-carbamate (Burgess reagent).

Scheme 1 Preparation of 2
As indicated in Scheme 1, the initial stage of preparation involved acetonide
protection
of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-l-threonine methyl ester with 2,2-dimethoxypropane (DMP) in the presence
of a catalytic amount of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF3·Et2O) in CH2Cl2 at
room temperature to give oxazolidine 3 in 91% yield.
The ester group of 3 was then reduced by LiBH4 in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/methanol to afford alcohol 4 in 84% yield.26 A subsequent
Appel reaction of the hydroxy group of 4 with CBr4 and PPh3 in CH2Cl2 gave
brominated product 5 in 41% yield.

The coupling
of 5 with 4-mercapto-2-methylphenol was
then carried out in the presence of Cs2CO3 in
acetonitrile at room temperature over 12 h to give 6 in
61% yield. Etherification of the resulting phenol group with ethyl
bromoacetate in the presence of Cs2CO3 in acetonitrile
then afforded 7 in 96% yield. Subsequent deprotection
of both acetonide and Boc groups of 7 was achieved in
a single step using excess trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dimethylformamide
(DMF) at 50 °C over 24 h followed by column chromatographic purification,
to give alcohol-amine 8 in 64% yield.27 Subsequently, the introduction of a thioamide group into 8 was carried out using 2-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylcarbonothioyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione
(11) in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in CH2Cl2 to
give the desired thioamide 9 in 43% yield.28

To complete the novel synthesis of 2, formation of
the thiazoline ring from 9 was performed using DAST in
CH2Cl2 at −78 °C over 2 h to provide
the corresponding thiazoline 10 in 79% yield.29 Use of Burgess reagent in the place of DAST
was also possible in this step to give thiazoline 10 in
64% yield;30 however, a longer reaction
time and a higher temperature were required. Finally, saponification
of 10 using 2 M LiOH in a mixture of THF/water provided
the desired product 2 as a pale yellow solid in 91% yield.
Thus, the first enantiospecific synthesis of the novel scaffold 2 was accomplished over nine steps in an overall yield of
3.6%. Further details regarding the synthetic route and characterization
of the final product can be found in the Supporting Information.

We also compared the stereochemistry of
some additional products
based on that of compound 2 (see Figure 2 below). To synthesize a substance exhibiting
the same stereochemical structure, l-threonine methyl ester
hydrochloride was treated with triethylamine (TEA) and 11 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature to give thioamide 12 in 50% yield (Scheme 2). Subsequently, the thiazoline ring was generated
using DAST in CH2Cl2 to give the cyclized product 13 in 69% yield.

Figure 2 Experimental CD spectra of compounds 2 and 13.

Scheme 2 Preparation of Pulicatin Derivative 13
Thus, the absolute configurations
of thiazolines 2 and the single isomer of 13 were determined by measuring
the specific optical rotations of the two products and carrying out
circular dichroism (CD) experiments (Figure 2). The obtained results were compared with
the literature value for a similar compound bearing the (4R,5S)-pulicatin A configuration (see Figure 1).1 The 1H-1H correlated spectroscopy
(COSY), nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of compound 2 (see the Supporting Information and Figure 3) were also recorded to confirm the stereochemistry
of this product.

Figure 3 Key HMBC, COSY, and NOESY correlations for compound 2.

The biological activities of the
two key scaffolds, that is, GW501516
(1) and the synthesized 2, were then examined
through screening of their agonist activities toward PPARδ.
As shown in the Supporting Information,
the novel scaffold 2 displayed highly potent human peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor delta (hPPARδ) activity (EC50 = 6.2 nM) in a cell-based cotransfection assay.

3 Conclusions
We successfully synthesized the novel hPPARδ
agonist 2 in a convergent and enantioselective manner
using a chiral
pool of l-threonine, a naturally occurring amino acid, as
the starting material. The developed synthetic protocol for the preparation
of the thiazoline structure involved simple and high-yielding chemical
transformations. Following preliminary in vitro pharmacological studies,
we could also conclude that scaffold 2 displayed highly
potent hPPARδ activity. Further investigation into the preparation
of synthetic derivatives of 2 and related structure–activity
relationship studies are ongoing, and the results will be reported
in due course, with the aim of developing a novel hPPARδ agonist
for medicinal purposes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General
All reactions were monitored
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), performed using 0.2 mm silica
gel plates (Merck 60 F254) and visualized by UV light (254
nm) and stain solutions, such as KMnO4 and p-anisaldehyde, with heating. Medium pressure liquid chromatography
(MPLC) was carried out on a CombiFlash Rf system with RediSep Rf using
flash column cartridges packed with silica gel. The purity of the
target compounds was determined to be >95% by analytical high-performance
liquid chromatography using dual different wavelength UV detector
(254 and 280 nm). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer
at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C. Chemical
shifts (δ) were reported in parts per million (ppm) relative
to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard, and coupling constants
were expressed in hertz. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained using
a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 spectrometer, and mass spectra were measured
with a JEOL JMS 700 high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) at the
Korean Basic Science Institute (Daegu). Melting points were determined
using MP90 Melting Point System with open capillaries, and optical
rotations were measured on an AutoPOL I automatic polarimeter. CD
spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter.

Commercially available
reagent grade chemicals, such as N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-l-threonine methyl ester and l-threonine methyl ester hydrochloride, were used as received without

4.5 In Vitro
Transfection Assay
The monkey
kidney cells, CV-1, were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% resin-charcoal-stripped fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin
in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 in air) at 37 °C.
CV-1 cells were seeded at 6 × 103 cells per well in 96-well culture
plates and then grown to 70% confluence before transfection. The cells
were washed with serum-free medium and then transfected with a plasmid
mixture containing human PPAR expression vector, β-galactosidase,
and TK-PPRE-Luc vector by SuperFect reagent (QIAGEN). The 24 h post-transfected
cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and incubated with freshly
delipidated 5% FBS DMEM supplemented with either compounds or DMSO
vehicle for 24 h. After incubation, cell lysates were obtained using
cell lysis buffer, and a luciferase activity was determined upon substrate
addition using a Microlumat Plus Luminometer (Berthold). The luciferase
activity was normalized with b-galactosidase activity using
an ONPG buffer. All of the assays were performed in triplicate.
