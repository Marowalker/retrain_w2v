This article highlights the effects from
composite manufacturing parameters on fiber-reinforced composite laminates
modified with layers of piezoelectric thermoplastic nanofibers and
a conductive electrode layer. Such modifications have been used for
enabling in situ deformation measurement in high-performance aerospace
and renewable energy composites. Procedures for manufacturing high-performance
composites are well-known and standardized. However, this does not
imply that modifications via addition of functional layers (e.g.,
piezoelectric nanofibers) while following the same manufacturing procedures
can lead to a successful multifunctional composite structure (e.g.,
for enabling in situ measurement). This article challenges success
of internal embedment of piezoelectric nanofibers in standard manufacturing
of high-performance composites via relying on composite process specifications
and parameters only. It highlights that the process parameters must
be revised for manufacturing of multifunctional composites. Several
methods have been used to lay up and manufacture composites such as
electrospinning the thermoplastic nanofibers, processing an inter
digital electrode (IDE) made by conductive epoxy–graphene resin,
and prepreg autoclave manufacturing aerospace grade laminates. The
purpose of fabrication of IDE was to use a resin type (HexFlow RTM6)
for the conductive layer similar to that used for the composite. Thereby,
material mismatch is avoided and the structural integrity is sustained
via mitigation of downgrading effects on the interlaminar properties.
X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy analyses
have been carried out in the material characterization phase. Pulsed
thermography and ultrasonic C-scanning were used for the localization
of conductive resin embedded within the composite laminates. This
study also provides recommendations for enabling internally embedded
piezoelectricity (and thus health-monitoring capabilities) in high-performance
composite laminates.

1 Introduction
Various
industries such as aerospace and renewable energy sectors intensively
use polymer composite materials for their lightness and tailorable
design as well as their outstanding mechanical properties. However,
aviation safety regulations and reliability assurance of the structural
integrity are crucial factors in driving the use of such materials
in aircraft and turbine blade structures. To satisfy both, nondestructive
inspection (NDI) of the structure is carried out, which is complicated,
costly, and inefficient than that for metallic structures because
of the multiple material structure of the composites. Moreover, existing
NDI techniques are unable to detect zero-thickness interlaminar bond
defects (so-called kissing and weak bonds) likely to occur in composite
adhesively bonded joints1−3 or composite laminate manufacturing.4 Therefore, development of new in situ health-monitoring techniques
is required. Smart composites have been developed for structural or
internal deformation and damage measurement in various fields such
as optoelectronics,5−11 pulsed power systems,12−14 temperature and vapor/liquid
sensing,15−20 energy harvesting,21−25 and transistors
and inverters.20,26−31 In such composites,
addition of electric, dielectric, or other functional materials and
fillers enhances the electrical properties32,33 as
well as mechanical properties.34

Piezoelectric sensing has been gaining increased interest for electric
measurement of deformation in structures for years but its low durability,
low capability for complex parts, and limited strain-to-failure resistivity
lessen its possibilities to be considered for long-term applications.35,36 Fiber optic sensing proposes a continuous and real-time health monitoring
of composite structures. Its lightness, stability, nonelectromagnetic
reactivity, robustness, and allowance to be used on large structures
make this candidate highly promising in detections.37 Despite the advantages, fibers have relatively low mechanical
strength and can irreversibly be damaged and malfunctioned. This may
lead to life-span mismatch between optical fibers and high-performance
composite laminates in applications.

For piezoelectric materials,
the elastic strain energy of the body can be related to their dielectric
energy. Thus, a proportionality can be established between the mechanical
deformation of the material and an electrical signal change, for example,
change in voltage.38 Categorized as polymers,
they can make ideal candidates to reduce material mismatch in bonding
with polymer composites (the foundation of the current paper). However,
because of their particular crystallographic structure, piezoelectric
materials are highly anisotropic, which means that the electrical
properties vary with the orientation of the crystal.39 Thus, it is necessary to give orientation to the properties
required for directional tailoring. The current research work represents
a novel, rapid technology applicable to large structures that use
electrospinning technique to produce ultrathin unidirectional polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers and embed such materials onto the laminates
in situ. Introduction of thermoplastic veils and films has already
proven durable and thermally stable candidates for the purpose of
interlaminar toughening in composite laminate manufacturing (e.g.,
see ref (4)). However,
their thickness is at the level of ply thickness, for example, 200
μm, and therefore, addition to the overall thickness of the
structure is considerable. Also, such introduction of veils is not
fully automated yet and can also have significant increasing effect
on the overall weight of a laminated structure (if added over each
ply). The proposed technology in the current article will have almost
zero weight and thickness penalty at its scale-up.

PVDF is a
fluoropolymer thermoplastic resulting from the polymerization of vinylidene
difluoride.39 PVDF is chemically stable
that prevents from chemical reaction when this material is introduced
into a system and shows good resistance to oxidation and UV light.40 This polymer is naturally piezoelectric and
belongs to the electroactive polymer family.39 PVDF has a semicrystalline polymorphic structure with five phases
of α, β, γ, δ, and ε. The first three
phases are the most commonly used in in situ measurement applications.41 The PVDF polymer chain is composed of two types
of groups: CF2 fluorine group (electrically negative) and
CH2 hydrogen group (electrically positive). Depending on
the localization of these groups along the chain, an electrical dipole
moment is generated (approximately 5–8 × 10–30 C.m). Thus, its use is appropriate for sensor and actuator development.42

The electrospinning process is commonly
used to produce PVDF nanofibers. The purpose of this study was to
rapidly produce highly oriented PVDF nanofibers and lay up over high-performance
thermoset composite laminates for enabling internal in situ measurement
in composite aircraft structures. During the curing process of the
laminates, the PVDF material undergoes high temperature (>Tm) and constant pressure for a certain duration
depending on the composite process specifications. As a result, PVDF
may undergo a new phase transformation. The variation of the piezoelectric
response of the material after PVDF being subjected to temperature
treatments has already been reported.43 Therefore, the loss of performance of the material under temperature
treatment has quantitatively been evaluated.

According to a
study on stretched PVDF, the transformation of α phase into
β phase seems to be more affected by the stretching ratio than
the stretching temperature.44 Because of
the use of aerospace prepregnated thermoset composite pre-pregs for
manufacturing composite laminates, heat energy at relatively high
temperature (>120 °C) is required for the curing to be effective,
for example, approx. 180 °C for carbon fiber pre-pregs. Reticulation
occurs between polymer chains, which leads to strongest bonds within
the structure and solidification of the material. The melting temperature
of the PVDF material is 171–175 °C, which means that during
curing, the PVDF fibers will be partially molten. This means that
the piezoelectric capability of PVDF fibers may still be valid after
high-temperature exposure. The study in this article aims to present
what piezoelectric capabilities can be left at the postprocess stage,
where the material is solidified for high-performance structural applications.
The paper is divided to a number of sections to address such aim: section 2 presents data for
the materials used in this study and the manufacturing steps to develop
an integrated composite laminate-PVDF-inter digital electrode (IDE).
The section also provides theoretical background for definition of
an IDE layout and discusses limitations with the manufacturing steps
taken. Characterization and microscopy techniques used on the postprocessed
manufactured laminates are also explained. Section 3 presents the results obtained from the techniques
described in the latter section and discusses the possibility of the
presence of piezoelectric phases pre- and post-manufacturing. Section 4 presents data from
pulsed thermography and ultrasound NDI techniques and in connection
with the results presented in section 5 discusses the effect of manufacturing steps on the
mechanical performance of such an integrated multimaterial laminate.

2 Materials and Manufacturing
The current research addresses aerospace and renewable energy applications,
which means that the relevant standards must be followed for the manufacturing
choices: type of fibers and resin, stacking sequence, curing cycles,
and so forth. To do so, the materials (as described below) were processed
according to composite process specifications provided in product
datasheet.45

2.1 Materials
The following structural grade
materials were selected. Table 1 presents the materials and the reason they were chosen. The
materials were then processed according to the specifications provided
by the suppliers, for example, Hexcel. The relevant standards used
for such processes45 were followed to ensure
reliability of processes.

a All of these materials were chosen for their high quality, innovative,
and reliable aspects for the manufacturing steps taken during the
project.

The composite laminates were manufactured
using unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced thermoset polymer pre-pregs
made of high-toughness resin (M21). Each cured ply had the thickness
of approximately 0.125 mm (cured using an autoclave according to the
specifications of the supplier). The plies were stacked to make quasi-isotropic
configuration, and the PVDF and conductive layer were added just below
the upper ply. The laminate was then vacuum-bagged and heated at 180
°C for a duration of 2 h under 7 bar constant pressure.

2.2 Integrated Composite Laminate
Definition
The stacking sequence of the composite laminate
was chosen to be symmetric and quasi-isotropic, [−45/+45/90/0]s, which enables producing composite samples with approximately
homogenized isotropic properties. Figure 1 schematically shows the main composition
of the laminate. The PVDF layer was set to be embedded just one layer
beneath the upper ply of the laminate. That would introduce sufficient
justification of internal embedment of an in situ measurement capability
rather than a severe consideration, for example, embedment in the
middle layer.

Figure 1 Quasi-isotropic stacking sequence of integrated
composite laminates.

2.3 Polymer-Based
IDE Layout Definition
The IDE layer plays a central role
in the laminate for a health-monitoring purpose. The two types of
unimorph electrodes (d33 and d31) were initially considered. However,
because of the porous morphology of the piezoelectric, a reliable
electrode with a d33 configuration appeared to be too risky. FibroTend
layer is ultrathin (∼250 nm to 1 μm) and composed of
numerous fibers, which would easily let a conductive resin flow through
it during the curing cycle, leading to short circuits. Therefore,
the simple d33 configuration was abandoned for a d31 configuration.
The main difficulty was to make sure that the IDE would be an integrated
part of the laminate to serve structural integrity (i.e., not acting
as an external object/defect) by an effective bonding between the
IDE and the pre-pregs. This aspect is novel and such introduction
has rarely been exercised. The IDE layout was developed using graphene
mixing in a resin (RTM6) similar to that of the composite laminate
(M21) over the PVDF layer (Figure 1). Therefore, curing of the resin from both pre-preg
and the IDE was done simultaneously to produce strong bonding as the
layout was then an integrated part of the structure. However, a drawback
in such an integration technique was that the layout resin was allowed
to flow during autoclave processing and as such, there was no control
on its change of geometry. To avoid possible short circuits during
such a flow, the authors took a theoretical step for design of the
IDE layout with the widest possible spacing according to the recommendations
provided in the following section.

2.3.1 Design of the IDE Layout for Composite Integration
According to studies done on piezoelectric ceramic materials, the
IDE layout strongly influences the performance of a measurement system.46 Referring to the definition of the IDE layout
in the previous section, it has been shown that the following relationships
should be considered for optimizing the IDE layout performances46 1  where 2  

Another study with
a metal IDE on a piezoelectric polymer [poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)]
confirms that w must be maximized and s must be minimized.47 The piezoelectric
FibroTend layer provided in this study has a minimum thickness of
∼250 nm, which allowed for calculating the thickness of the
electrode fingers 3  

Thus: we = 0.8 . 250 = 200 nm.

Moreover, the
samples were initially designed following the ASTM 7264 standard for
the four-point bending mechanical testing after manufacturing. This
led to a sample size of 13 mm × 90 mm × 2 mm with a potential
electrode width of w = 10 mm. Thus, with a least
restrictive w/s ratio of 6, the
finger spacing was s = 1.7 mm.

According to
the choice of the resin dispersion method, the nanoscale dispersion
appeared difficult to achieve. Therefore, the electrode layout was
scaled up to a millimeter scale with larger electrode fingers (we) and larger finger spacing (s). Also, s should be minimized compared to w which should be maximized. The electrode is placed/printed
at the center of the length of the sample, and the length of the electrode
is limited to fit with the span of the upper clamping fixtures used
for applying the mechanical load. This condition is required to ensure
that the electrode is not damaged because of the introduction of localized
stress from the fixtures in contact with the sample. Therefore, the
dimensions of the sample were reviewed for the specific purpose of
integrating with the composite laminate and recommended as below (shown
in Figure 2).

Figure 2 Schematic of the scaled-up
IDE electrode layout
for composite integration.

The width of the sample was increased to 30 mm with the electrode
width w of 20 mm. The electrode finger width we was set at 1.5 mm and the spacing between
the fingers to 3 mm. This scale-up led to the following ratios: we/hp = 12 and w/s = 6.67.

2.3.2 Conductive Resin
Graphene was supplied
in a powder form by Cambridge Nanosystems (Table 1) for mixing the powder into the epoxy resin.
Therefore, the laboratory risk assessment imposed a use limited to
1 g of powder. It has been shown that the increasing weight percentage
of graphene in the resin has an increasing effect on the electrical
conductivity of the resin. Several studies with different polymer
and graphene types show a similar specific trend: conductivity increases
significantly with graphene content up to reaching a threshold circa
2 wt % graphene filler.48

Accordingly,
the conductivity of the resin examined in this study was increased
via high shear mixing of graphene nanopowders composing of•40 g of HexFlow RTM6 epoxy resin
and

•0.8 g of CamGraph G1 A graphene
powder,

which result in an approximately 2 wt
% concentration of graphene in the epoxy resin. Trials on high shear
mixing and ultrasonic exfoliation were carried out to avoid/mitigate
the presence of high agglomeration. There was no control on reagglomeration
during the composite laminate manufacturing process; however, the
authors emphasize that the current research has mainly been focused
on the effect of composite processing on the presence of piezoelectric
phases rather than reagglomeration.

2.4 Laminate Manufacturing
The following
steps have been followed to manufacture the modified integrated composite
laminate:(1) Cutting
pre-pregs at the neat size of the final sample (30 mm × 90 mm),
with the relevant orientation of 0°, 45°, or 90°.

(2) Stacking of the pre-preg
pieces in the quasi-isotropic order (Figure 1).

(3) Deposition of the conductive resin using jet printing.

(4) Finishing the laminate
with the last eighth ply on which the piezoelectric FibroTend had
already been deposited via electrospinning, as shown in Figure 3. This ply must be integrated
with the layer of piezoelectric nanofibers directly in contact with
the electrode to have a close electrical circuit.

(5) All samples were placed and layed
up with the FibroTend layer on top for autoclave processing. In addition
of the required release films for vacuum-bagging, a metal plate was
placed on top of the samples to ensure uniform pressurization during
the curing process. Standard curing cycle as specified in the Hexply
specifications45 (shown in Figure 5) was conducted. Hexcel provides
two standard curing cycles for laminates composed of Hexply M21 T700
CF–epoxy pre-preg having thicknesses of <15 mm: one with
a heat-up rate at 1 °C/min and a second at 3 °C/min. The
curing cycle with a heat-up rate of 1 °C/min was selected for
this study so as to limit the flow of the conductive electrode resin.
Viscosity and the resin flow decrease with the duration, whereas temperature
constantly increases. The trend in viscosity changes after 100 min
according to the Hexply specifications, that is, it embarks on a sharp
increase with time. A lower heat-up rate enables to moderate the viscosity
drop until the resin reticulates for times <100 min and thus significantly
reduces the chance of high resin flow and thus short circuits in the
IDE layout.

To assess the influence of
the laminate modification (i.e., addition of a FibroTend layer and
an electrode), eight additional samples were also manufactured with
no FibroTend-IDE layer. These samples are referred to as reference
samples in this paper.

2.5 Characterization of PVDF Materials
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
characterization techniques were used for analysis of the morphology
and crystal phases of five categories of samples, which are labeled
and tabulated in Table 2.

2.6 Postmanufacturing
Analysis
The integrated laminates were also analyzed after
manufacturing using the characterization techniques described above.
The objectives were to understand the IDE pattern localization, the
FibroTend piezoelectric characteristics after curing, the electrical
capability of the cured graphene–epoxy resin, and the effects
of such multimaterial integration taken in this study on the mechanical
properties. Pulsed thermography, ultrasonic C-scanning, XRD, FTIR
spectroscopy, and electrical resistance testing were used for post
integration stage of the study.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Raw Material Characterization
This section
presents data from the characterization and microscopy techniques
described in section 2. Four techniques were used for the morphology analysis and crystal-phase
characterization.

FEI/Philips XL30 SEM was used to visually
analyze the sample quality, homogeneity, and morphology. Estimation
of the contamination level and composition was also carried out using
EDXS in the scanning electron microscope. Samples for such measurements
were vacuumed at 25 °C and gold-coated on the surface by an approx.
5–10 nm thickness layer. X-ray measurements were carried out
using a Siemens D5005 X-ray diffractometer to determine the piezoelectric
phases. The samples for such a measurement were different in size
and shape according to Table 2; however, all samples were cleaned off under vacuum for 30
min. FTIR spectroscopy was also carried out using Jacson FTIR 6200ATR
ZnSe, and the samples were treated under vacuum for 5 min each.

3.1.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy
Powder sample exhibited a homogeneous sphere size with average
diameter of approximately 100 μm, as shown in Figure 4a. The Finetex sample showed
an unaligned mat of fibers (Figure 4b), with average fiber diameter of ∼150 nm.
Some beading and significant variation in the thickness of the fibers
can also be observed, as well as no overall trend in orientation as
shown in Figure 4b.
The FibroTend 1 bundled fiber sample (stretched by 100 mm, 25%) showed
different fiber sizes (Figure 4c), with many in excess of 2 μm in diameter (average
diameter ≈ 2.3 μm). The FibroTend 2 sample (stretched
by 320 mm, 300%) clearly showed significantly more damaged and broken
fibers (Figure 4d),
resulting from those that did not survive the stretching electrospinning
process. At present, there is no mechanism for removing these fibers,
but as can be seen in Figure 4d, they pose a relatively minor surface contamination compared
to the bulk of the sample. The average fiber diameter was expectedly
lower (<1.5 μm) for the stretched sample FibroTend 2 than
for FibroTend 1.

Figure 4 SEM images
of (a) PVDF
raw powder, (b) Finetex, (c) FibroTend 1, and (d) FibroTend 2.

The FibroTend samples were significantly thicker
than the fibers observed from the Finetex sample. Also, because of
the bundled nature of the samples supplied by Munro Technology Limited,
it was not possible to observe the overall trends in fiber alignment.

3.1.2 Energy Dispersive
X-ray Spectroscopy
EDXS spectra were collected from the PVDF
powder, Finetex, and FibroTend 1 and 2, and analysis was performed
multiple times per sample to generate a robust statistical distribution.
FibroTend 3 was processed precisely identical to FibroTend 2, however,
on an aluminum substrate and thus was not characterized. Results from
the powder indicated a carbon:fluorine ratio of between 4:1 and 2:1,
indicating significant sample contamination, as the expected result
was a 1:1 ratio of carbon to fluorine (PVDF unit cell is −C2F2H2−). Finetex gave a C/F ratio
of 56.5:43.5 based on a relatively large area scan, much closer to
the expected values. However, looking at relatively small areas gave
much lower values for fluorine content, as low as 15%. That might
be explained by a higher detection of the carbon tape on which the
Finetex is stuck depending on the sample regions studied (sign of
inhomogeneity of the mat porosity). Spectroscopy of the FibroTend
fibers (1 and 2) resulted in a wide range of results across the sample,
ranging from 10 to 50%, indicating a wide margin of error, perhaps
resulting from thin material samples, or contamination resulting from
handling of the fibers.

The disparity between small-scale and
large-area measurements indicated that in certain areas of the fiber,
carbon-based contamination has occurred to increase the apparent percentage
of carbon observed. This contamination can come from the manufacturing
process, manipulation, and detection of the carbon tape on which the
sample is stuck for being analyzed. As no sample exceeded a fluorine
ratio of 50%, it can be assumed that this is an accurate assumption.
No peak that could be attributed to any other atomic element than
carbon, fluorine, or gold (coating) was identified. In particular,
no nitrogen was observed in any of the spectra of the prepared fibers,
indicating that a negligible amount of solvent was present.

3.1.3 X-ray Diffraction
For determination of the PVDF phase present in the material, an XRD
analysis was carried out.49−52Figure 5 depicts a typical
XRD patterns of the three α, β, and γ phases in
a PVDF material, with both peak angles and (hkl)
planes.52

Figure 5 XRD patterns
of the three α, β, and γ phases, with both peak
angles and (hkl) planes.52

Before analyzing the spectrums
in details, it is necessary to highlight a technical limitation of
performing XRD on PVDF FibroTend nanofibers provided. The amount of
material required to produce a valid data is hardly compatible with
the nanoscale of the fibers. Therefore, the following procedure was
employed:Powder: sufficient
amount of the material and reliable method. Reliable data were obtained.

Finetex: after several attempts, a full
A4 sheet of PVDF has been folded and stuck on a glass holder. The
result is acceptable. However, a higher uncertainty of the measurement
should be taken into account because of the less dense sample (it
is difficult to compress the folded sheet).

FibroTend 1, 2, and 3: a full A4 amount of PVDF nanofiber has been
doubled and folded on a glass holder. The quality of the measurement
is similar to that of the Finetex.



Fibers
could have been grinded into powder; however, the risk of the phase
change was likely. Therefore, this option was not considered. For
the three types of PVDF samples, the spectrum obtained presented a
similar structure: significant (high intensity) peaks between 17°
and 23°, limited (medium intensity) peaks between 24° and
41°, and a flat and nonsignificant (low intensity) shape elsewhere,
as displayed in Figure 6. The measurement was carried out from 10° to 60°, but
only a magnified view between 14° and 42° is presented for
readability of the report. Note that FibroTend 1 and 2 spectrums are
not displayed in the figure as no significant difference can be identified
with the FibroTend 3 spectrum. It implies that the level of electrospinning
stretching between +25 and +300% leads to the same crystal composition.

Figure 6 XRD phase spectrums of three forms of analyzed
PVDF, ranging from
14° to 42°.

It can be noticed that some peaks are particularly distinct (high
and sharp), whereas others are broader. When a peak is broad, it is
difficult to associate a single value of angle, as in such cases,
the uncertainty of the spectrum reading and the inaccuracy of the
conclusion increases. From these three graphs, Table 3 can be extracted. It gathers 2θ angles
associated with the peaks observed from each spectrum. They are sorted
by the PVDF phase they represent.

Table 3 Summary of XRD Phase Results for PVDF Powder,
Finetex, and FibroTend

Because the reliable quality
of the powder spectrum, it can be concluded that it is composed of
α and/or β phases. Some characteristic peaks from those
two phases (at 20.1° and 26.8°) are very close to each other,
which leads to an ambiguous reading of the spectrum. Regarding Finetex
and FibroTend, spectrums are poor; only few peaks on each spectrum
can be analyzed. In addition, these peaks are really broad, which
does not allow us to conclude with a high certainty that both samples
made of the stretched fibers are composed of the β crystal phase.
In the Finetex spectrum, only β phase characteristic peaks (20.8°
and 36.5°) seem to fit with the peaks obtained. Thus, the PVDF
sheet must be mainly composed of β crystal phase. For FibroTend,
the result is less apparent. The single broad peak obtained can be
associated with the three crystal phases (20.1°, 20.3°,
and 20.2°). No certain conclusion can be made from this spectrum.

The three XRD spectrums are not sufficiently reliable to status
on the crystal phase composition of PVDF powder, Finetex, and FibroTend.
Therefore, further characterization was carried out. Using a second
analytical technique such as Raman spectroscopy or FTIR spectroscopy
technique would allow us to remove the doubt on powder (α and/or
γ) and FibroTend (β and/or α) phase composition
and confirm the β phase composition of Finetex. Also, unlikely
to XRD phase analysis, an interest of the FTIR analysis is to be quantitative.
It enables us to understand better the proportion of each phase within
the material.

3.1.4 FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR wavenumbers (cm–1) analyzed in some previous studies for PVDF material are studied.44,50,51,53−55 The absorbance
band 840 cm–1 can be associated to both β
and γ phases because of their really close vibrational frequencies.
However, a shoulder of the 840 cm–1 peak at 833
cm–1 can be observed for the γ phase only.50 To distinguish more clearly those two β
and γ phases, further comparisons should be considered such
as peaks at 1275 cm–1 (for β) and 1234 cm–1 (for γ), which are specific to each phase.
In Figure 7, the most
interesting characteristic peaks for distinguishing α, β,
and γ crystal phases are displayed.

and γ PVDF crystal phases.50

spectrums obtained present similar overall spectrums. Figure 8 displays the FTIR attenuated
total reflectance ZnSe spectrums of the five forms of PVDF analyzed.
Most of the peaks are between 550 and 1450 cm–1.
Below 550 cm–1, the quality of the measurement is
too dependent on the device, which makes it unreliable. Above 1450
cm–1, all spectrums are flat with limited peaks.

Figure 8 FTIR spectrums
of the five forms of PVDF analyzed, selected range from 550 to 1450
cm–1.

It can be observed that the trend in the appearance of the peaks
is the same for the five spectrums. However, the powder spectrum seems
slightly different to the other four, with some peak shifts (around
870, 1070, or 1180 cm–1) and higher additional peaks
at approx. 612, 760, 795, 1207, or 1384 cm–1. The
powder is the raw material and has not been stretched unlike the other
samples. To understand better the impact of electrospinning on the
PVDF phase, it is required to compare the powder composition (initial
raw material) with the highly stretched, processed fibers (e.g., FibroTend
3). Previously, the XRD results in Figure 6 and Table 3 showed that the level of electrospinning stretching
between +25% (FibroTend 1) and +300% (FibroTend 2, 3) leads to the
same crystal composition. This has also been stressed herein by the
FTIR data. Table 4 tabulates
each spectrum wavenumbers in association with the peaks observed.

To conclude, the PVDF powder is mainly composed of α phase,
with some potential traces of β and γ phases. This is
in agreement with the XRD results, so the powder crystal composition
can be considered as confirmed and reliable for further studies. Finetex
spectrum displays two peaks (840 and 1175 cm–1),
which are common to both β and γ phases. However, there
is a distinct peak at 1275 cm–1 and no peak at 1234
cm–1, which are corresponding to the singular peaks
distinguishing the β phase from the γ phase. This leads
to the conclusion in agreement with the XRD results that the Finetex
sample is mainly composed of the β crystal phase. Regarding
the FibroTend, many peaks corresponds to β or γ phases.
However, β peaks are more dominant (higher than the other representative
peaks and more distinct). Therefore, it can be considered that the
FibroTend fibers are mainly composed of β phase, though some
γ phase is remaining. These results from XRD and FTIR spectroscopy
are logical with the manufacturing process that the PVDF powder, Finetex,
and FibroTend undergo and are schematically shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 PVDF crystal phases related
to electrospinning
process; *in the case of FibroTend electrospinning PVDF powder was
diluted in DMF.

FibroTend was stretched
up to an average fiber diameter of ∼1.5 μm, whereas Finetex
was stretched up to ∼150 nm. The α phase is the easiest
to produce and the most chemically stable and inert phase, which is
a strong interest for commercialization purpose of raw PVDF powder.
The β phase can be achieved after mechanical stretching, such
as electrospinning. This process stretches and aligns polymer fibers
and leads to a reorganization of the polymer chain. Both Finetex and
FibroTend are mainly composed of this process. The γ phase remains
from the dissolution of the raw PVDF powder into dimethylformamide
(DMF), preliminary of the electrospinning. The efficiency of the process
is not 100%, which justifies why not all of the material is made of
β phase and explains the lower traces of γ phase remaining
in Finetex.

3.2 Postprocessed Material Characterization
Once composite pre-pregs,
PVDF, and the conductive IDE layer were layed up, the laminate was
cured to integrate the layers. A new set of XRD and FTIR analysis
was then carried out to understand the impact of the curing parameters
(temperature, duration, and pressure) on the PVDF crystal phase and
to identify any piezoelectric remnant phases as curing-linked modification
of the phases may lead to reduction of piezoelectricity capability.

3.2.1 X-ray Diffraction
XRD phase analysis on the integrated composite laminates was carried
out. However, for this study, the FibroTend layer embedded between
composite plies (having had ∼200 μm thickness) was too
thin (∼250 nm) and the amount of material was not sufficient
for determining the crystal phase. As seen in Figure 10, no peak previously observed with the raw
PVDF material (Figure 6) was detected. Figure 10 shows that the integrated and the reference (with no PVDF-IDE
layers) samples have similar spectrums. This confirms that only the
main laminate structure (carbon fiber and epoxy resin) contributes
to the detections. A slight increase (∼3%) of the main peak
(around 25.5°) was observed for the integrated sample. This is
due to the detection of graphene present in the conductive resin forming
the conductive layer.56,57

composite
laminates.

3.2.2 FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR spectroscopy was
performed on the integrated and reference samples. Similar to XRD
results, no characteristic peak previously seen with the PVDF raw
material (Figure 8)
can be observed on the integrated sample spectrum, displayed in Figure 11. Also, no significant
difference can be observed between the integrated and reference sample
spectrums, except a lower intensity of the integrated sample spectrum.
This attributes to the presence of additional conductive resin absorbing
energy provided for the analysis, which lessen the output energy detected.

Figure 11 FTIR spectrums of both modified and reference
composite
laminates.

To conclude, postmanufacturing material characterization with XRD
and FTIR techniques did not allow us to identify the PVDF FibroTend
crystal phase. A new set of experimentations will be highly valuable
to understand better the impact of the curing features on the PVDF
piezoelectric crystal phase, and also, samples with a thicker FibroTend
layer may provide a clearer spectrum.

3.2.3 Electrical Resistance Characterization
Even though the conductive resin from the IDE layout has flown
during the processing, an electrical resistance was able to be measured,
using a coarse range of 1–100 MΩ. The resistivity was
approximately 2.5–35 MΩ comparable to that of the layer
cured for initial trials outside the laminate. This clearly shows
that there is either no or slight short circuit because of resin flow
or contact with carbon fibers during laminate embedment and curing.
The IDE design recommendations in section 2.3 were then able to efficiently enable internal
conductive layer embedment. As aforementioned, such an embedment technology
is highly advantageous and superior to current state-of-the-arts as
the conductive nanoparticles have been distributed inside a thermoset
polymer resin which is identical to the polymer matrix of the composite.
Such a similarity should provide enhanced structural integrity via
avoiding bond degradation due to material mismatch. NDI and mechanical
testing have followed the manufacturing step to investigate the enhancements.
The following sections presents their results.

4 NDI Data
The NDI data
are presented in this section only for the composite laminates post
cure, the two types of integrated laminate (internally embedded with
PVDF-conductive layers) and the reference laminate (only carbon composite
pre-pregs). NDI was carried out on the samples prior to mechanical
testing.

4.1 Pulsed Thermography
Two types of comparisons were achieved with the two samples:1. On the integrated sample,
comparison of a region with the central conductive resin and a region
without it (at samples runways/corners) and

2. comparison between samples with and without FibroTend-conductive
layers.



The pulsed thermography examinations
showed that the thermal diffusivity behavior is different in regions
containing or not containing the conductive resin, within a sample
containing the FibroTend layer (Figure 12). This is due to a difference in thermal
conductivity of the two samples linked to the presence of graphene
nanomaterials, which in this case is enhanced by the conductive resin
(Figure 13). The difference
can be distinguished clearly in figures showing the 1st and 2nd derivatives
of the thermal decay behavior (Figures 13c,d and 14), respectively,
representing the rate and acceleration of the decay with respect to
time. This qualitative analysis is to highlight that flash thermography
may be interesting to assess the quality of the manufacturing (e.g.,
curing state) based on the NDI response of the rein-based electrode
layout.

flashing of the
samples: (a) reference sample and (b) integrated laminate sample (with
FibroTend-conductive layer) (dimensions of the sample: 30 × 90

4.2 Ultrasonic
C-Scanning
Figures 14 and 15 show ultrasound C-scanning
images of the reference and integrated samples, respectively. Results
for all samples per each type were consistent. Therefore, one representative
sample per each type only is shown below.

Figure 15 Image
of transmission
contrast of the integrated sample (width of samples: 30 mm).

The contrast in Figure 14 is not as high
as that in Figure 15, where the conductive layer is present in the integrated laminate.
The right edge in both samples and two left corners in the integrated
laminate show high contrast which attributes to the carbon composite
pre-preg been bent damaged during manufacturing. Transmission in Figure 14 is within a 40–85%
range, whereas in Figure 15, the transmission rises up to 100%, especially in the central
region encompassing the conductive layer. According to the literature,
epoxy resin has a high transmission coefficient (0.955) compared to
any other element composing the sample, for example, carbon and graphene.58 This comparison highlights a difference in the
composition between the two samples, that is, depending on the composition
of the laminate, the intensity of the image can vary.

5 Effect on the Mechanical Properties
The samples were tested mechanically post NDI using standard four-point
bend testing.59 The integrated samples
were not symmetric because of the presence of eccentric PVDF-conductive
layers (Figure 1).
Therefore, two sets of experiments were carried out considering the
two dissimilar sides of the sample:Five integrated samples were tested with the FibroTend facing up
(maximum strain on FibroTend).

Five integrated
samples were tested with the FibroTend facing down (minimum strain
on FibroTend).



For the reference samples,
even though the composition was symmetric, the manufacturing-induced
defects can be considered that may induce slight unsymmetrical properties,
for example, the downside of the laminate is not directly exposed
to heat during curing as it is laid on the table/fixture of the oven,
and heat is mainly reached via conductivity from the exposed faces
of the sample. Thus, on the same principle, samples were tested faced
up and samples faced down to provide a comparative study. For all
samples, the load-deflection curves were extracted. Figure 16 shows typical results for
the reference samples. The tests were proven consistent via providing
repeatable data. For each sample, a maximal load followed by a sudden
drop corresponding to the occurrence of macroscopic interlaminar delamination
damage was observed (highlighted within a red circle in the figure).
Data at such point are presented in Figure 17 for the integrated and referenced samples
faced up and down. Facing up and down did not give any definite conclusions
for the load-carrying capacity in bending as the load was higher for
the faced-down integrated samples and vice versa for the reference
ones. However, faced-down samples exhibited higher deflection.

Figure 16 Typical
four-point bending load-deflection curve for reference samples.

Figure 17 Average
load vs deflection values obtained with four-point bending test.

Even if the standard deviations are not negligible, a general tendency
can be observed. The orientation of the sample seemed to significantly
influence the flexural behavior. Samples facing down reached a maximal
deflection around 8–9 mm, whereas samples facing up (as depicted
in Figure 1) reached
a higher range around 11–12 mm. This difference may be explained
by the manufacturing parameters such as the aforementioned nonsymmetric
curing. The unsymmetrical integrated samples with FibroTend and the
conductive layer show advantageous bending properties in terms of
failure load when facing down and disadvantageous ones when facing
up, compared to their respective reference samples. However, whatever
the side of testing (either facing up or down), the integrated samples
fail at a lower deflection than that for the reference samples. Also,
it can be seen that the difference of maximal deflection is more important
between the integrated and reference samples when samples are facing
down than when they are facing up. This attributes to the maximal
strain occurring in the sample at the outer surface undergoing tensile
stresses, opposite to the loading pin surface, as epoxies are more
susceptible to tensile damage than compressive. However, it has been
shown in the literature that sudden drop points in lateral loading
(such as that in four-point bend tests) corresponds to extensive interlaminar
delamination occurring between internal layers (herein composite plies).60

When the FibroTend layer was on the outer
side (facing floor), this additional polymer layer associated with
conductive resin played a more important role. It confirms that the
FibroTend and/or the graphene–epoxy resin are a disadvantage
for the laminate properties in terms of maximal deflection. This observation
is supported by the visual assessment of the samples after failure.
The modified samples facing floor always delaminate and break at the
FibroTend layer interface.

Thus, it can be concluded that the
FibroTend layer and, in particular, the conductive resin additiondecreases the maximal deflection
achievable,

increases the failure load
when located at the outer face (facing floor), and

decreases the failure load when located at the inner
face (facing ceiling).



It can be assumed
that the conductive resin plays a larger role than the FibroTend layer
for decreasing the mechanical properties of the laminate. The conductive
epoxy has minor mechanical strength compared to the PVDF nanofibers
and its volume fraction is more important than the 0.2 gsm of FibroTend
embedded. Thus, a reduction of the conductive resin quantity used
for the IDE would be of interest in terms of both the IDE manufacturing
as detailed in Design of the IDE Layout for Composite
Integration section as well in ensuring satisfying mechanical
properties. Nevertheless, because of the significant standard deviation
of the results, a larger campaign of mechanical testing would be of
interest to confirm these observations.

This first mechanical
testing in this study allows us to raise a crucial topic: to what
extend the FibroTend layer and the conductive resin play a mechanical
role in the flexural toughness of the laminate: delamination, bonding,
interlaminar shear, and failure propagation mode are as many points
of interest for a further work. Independent of the electrical aspect
of the targeted health monitoring in this study, the additional elements
within the laminate must not reduce significantly the mechanical performances.
If due to health monitoring, the mechanical performances of the laminates
are less advantageous, their use might be questioned at the material
selection step of the structure design.

6 Conclusions
This research highlights the
importance of requiring new process cycles for addition of internal
piezoelectric capability and conductive layers. It proposes to use
a polymer system for the conductive layer (RTM6) similar to the composite
(M21) to reduce material mismatch and improve bonding between the
layer and plies. Raw material characterization before laminate manufacturing
showed reliable and satisfying piezoelectric results for PVDF powder,
Finetex, and FibroTend:XRD
and FTIR techniques gave in-agreement PVDF crystal phase,

SEM showed satisfying morphology: homogeneous
shape and expected size of fiber diameter,

EDXS highlighted a carbon-based contamination level slightly higher
than expected.



Regarding the manufacturing
of a high-performance laminate modified with a piezoelectric FibroTend
layer and a conductive resin electrode, main challenges experienced
were as follows:achieving a
satisfying conductive resin mixture: homogeneous mixing, graphene
safety requirements, and appropriate viscosity;

depositing conductive resin on pre-preg to form an IDE
layout with similar resin: print, thickness, and accuracy; and

curing laminate without the conductive resin
to flow: accuracy of the electrode layout depends on it.



Postprocessing analyses were promising:In terms of conductive resin localization,
pulsed thermography and ultrasonic C-scanning showed accurate localization.
In both cases, a significant difference in thermal decay or transmittance
was observed between a zone of the modified laminate with and without
the conductive resin.

Graphene–epoxy
resin (2 wt %) showed efficiency after curing as an electrical resistance
was measured.

Four-point bending tests
revealed the influence of the FibroTend layer and conductive resin
on the flexural properties of the modified laminate. Compared to the
reference samples, modified samples experienced a higher delamination
(localized at the FibroTend layer) with lower flexural strength.
