Fungi
of the genus Fusarium can produce secondary
metabolites such as naphthopyrones and naphthoquinones that are toxic
and expected to threaten the food and feed safety. In this study,
the occurrence of rubrofusarin, rubrofusarin isomer, and their quinone
forms in grains was identified and confirmed using ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbital ion trap
mass spectrometry (Q-Orbitrap MS). The quantitation of these compounds
in grain samples was also investigated using Q-Orbitrap MS. The results
showed the concentrations of rubrofusarin ranged from 3.278 to 33.82
μg/kg, from 0.815 to 61.86 μg/kg, and from 7.362 to 47.24
μg/kg for the maize, rice, and wheat samples, respectively.
By comparison, the abundances of their quinone forms were relatively
lower, and the concentration of quinone form of rubrofusarin isomer
was relatively higher than that of quinone form of rubrofusarin. These
compounds were also confirmed to coexist with other known Fusarium mycotoxins. The data-dependent tandem mass spectra
obtained from the Q-Orbitrap MS were validated to provide a wealth
of valuable information that allowed for advanced data interpretation
for solid confirmation of these compounds in grains. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study that concerns the occurrence
and quantitation of rubrofusarin, rubrofusarin isomer, and their quinone
forms in grains.

==== Body
Introduction
The
fungal genus Fusarium contains numerous species
that can infect a wide variety of cereal crops in the field and cause
plant diseases such as ear rot and head blight.1 Species of the genus Fusarium can produce
a great number of toxic metabolites during crop growth and storage
under specific climatic conditions.2,3 These include
the most common mycotoxins such as the trichothecenes, the fumonisins,
and zearalenone (ZEN), for which regulatory limits and standard detection
methods have been established in many countries.4−6 However, several
other toxic metabolites produced by Fusarium spp.
are expected to coexist with these well-investigated mycotoxins, and
may bring a potential issue relating to food and feed safety. And,
therefore, the identification of these unnoticed toxic metabolites
in food and feed deserves some attention.

Ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with
high-resolution mass spectrometry is one of the recently developed
and powerful analytical approach that has been used for the detection
of mycotoxins in a wide variety of matrices.7−10 Compared with the traditional
instrumental methods like liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet,
fluorescence detector and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry,11−13 one of its advantage is the use of full-scan acquisition mode, which
allows for the retrospective analysis of samples for screening other
nontargeted analytes besides the targeted mycotoxins. High-resolution
mass spectrometry has proved to be effective in the tentative identification
of a variety of potential risk substances in food and feed.14,15 And, therefore, it provides the possibility for screening the unnoticed
fungal toxic metabolites in food and feed during the routine detection
of mycotoxins.

Rubrofusarin and aurofusarin, produced by a variety
of Fusarium spp., are naphthopyrones and naphthoquinones
classes
of polyketides that contain a variety of fungal and plant metabolites
that have biological activities.16 Previous
studies demonstrate that rubrofusarin has anti-estrogenic effects17 and can inhibit the activity of human DNA topoisomerase
II-α.18 Aurofusarin is observed to
be cytotoxic in mammalian cells19 and can
generate oxidative stress and induce DNA damage.20 Therefore, rubrofusarin and aurofusarin are expected to
contribute to the overall toxicity of respective Fusarium mycotoxin mixtures. Recently, it is reported that the occurrence
of aurofusarin is prevalent in different types of cereal-based food
and feed commodities.21−23 However, none of the studies reported the occurrence
of rubrofusarin in food and feed, as it is usually considered as one
intermediate in fungal biosynthetic pathways (e.g., the aurofusarin
pathways in Fusarium graminearum)24 and cannot be accumulated during the growth
of fungi.25 This precludes the comprehensive
understanding on the potential risks of Fusarium mycotoxins
in food and feed.

In this study, the occurrence of rubrofusarin
in grains was identified
and confirmed using hybrid quadrupole orbital ion trap mass spectrometry
(Q-Orbitrap MS). And together with rubrofusarin, its isomer and quinone
forms were also found in grains. The quantitative and qualitative
methods of these compounds were also investigated. These results indicated
the co-occurrence of rubrofusarin, rubrofusarin isomer, and their
quinone forms with the Fusarium mycotoxins like deoxynivalenol
(DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) in grains.

Results and Discussion
Rubrofusarin
and Its Isomer Produced by F. graminearum
F. graminearum is one of
the species of genus Fusarium that could produce
rubrofusarin.26 Therefore, the metabolites
of F. graminearum were first analyzed
to investigate the production of rubrofusarin. Out of our expectation,
the extracted ion chromatogram of m/z 273.0757 ([rubrofusarin + H]+) revealed two ion peaks
besides those of rubrofusarin (Figure 1a,b). The product ions of these two precursor ions
were both identical with those of rubrofusarin standard (Figures S1a–c and S2), indicating one
isomer of rubrofusarin could also be produced by F.
graminearum. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study to report the discovery of rubrofusarin isomer, and
its structure is still unclear.

Figure 1 UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap MS analysis of rubrofusarin
and its isomer in
the metabolites of F. graminearum (a),
rubrofusarin standard (b), and representative real grain sample (c,
rice sample).

The production of rubrofusarin
and its isomer during the growth
of F. graminearum on maize matrix was
further dynamically investigated. The yields of these two metabolites
were expressed as the corresponding peak areas. The results showed
an increasing accumulation of rubrofusarin throughout the 30 days
of cultivation, whereas the production of rubrofusarin isomer reached
the maximum after 10 days of cultivation and then decreased gradually
to less than 10% of the maximum level (Figure 2). These results indicated that it was the
rubrofusarin isomer but not the known rubrofusarin that could not
be accumulated during the growth of F. graminearum. The decline of rubrofusarin isomer might provide new insights into
the biosynthesis of metabolites using rubrofusarin as an intermediate.

Figure 2 Production
of rubrofusarin and its isomer by F.
graminearum growing on maize matrix.

Occurrence of Rubrofusarin and Its Isomer
in Grains
Because rubrofusarin could be accumulated during
the laboratory culture
of F. graminearum, it raised our concerns
that whether rubrofusarin and its isomer existed in the real grain
samples. The “dilute-and-shoot” sample preparation and
full scan data acquisition using UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap MS had been previously
validated and applied to the multianalysis of mycotoxins in grains
in our previous studies.27 The advantage
of this approach was to allow for the retrospective analysis of the
samples for the screening of substances in the in-house database.
And, therefore, we reprocessed the raw data of naturally contaminated
grain samples using an in-house database containing rubrofusarin.
The screening results showed the presence of rubrofusarin in grains,
which could be confirmed by the well match of identification criteria
(Figures 1c and S1d). Although, for rubrofusarin isomer, the
weak ion peak indicated its presence, the abundance was too low to
trigger a data-dependent MS2 (ddMS2) scan to
make a confirmation. The low abundance of rubrofusarin isomer in grains
was possibly attributed to its decline during the growth of fungi,
as discovered above.

Occurrence of Quinone Forms of Rubrofusarin
and Its Isomer in
Grains
As one type of naphthopyrone, rubrofusarin was expected
to be oxidized to its quinone form with a formula of C15H10O6 and theoretical m/z of 287.0555 ([M + H]+).25 To validate this, rubrofusarin standard was dissolved in
methanol solution (methanol/water = 1:1, v:v) and then subject to
oxidation by purging filtered air bubble in the solution. The solution
was diluted and then subject to mass detection after 2 days oxidation.
The extracted ion chromatogram revealed an ion peak with m/z 287.0555 ([M + H]+, Figure 3a), indicating the generation
of quinone form of rubrofusarin. The major product ion had a formula
of C13H8O5 (m/z 244.0370, Figure S3a), which
was consistent with the quinone form of product ion from rubrofusarin
(C13H10O4, m/z 230.0574, Figure S1). These
results confirmed that it was the oxidation product of rubrofusarin
(quinone form). The oxidation of rubrofusarin could also be observed
during the instrumental analysis due to the presence of oxygen in
the extraction solution and mobile phase. And, therefore, it was possible
to investigate the quinone form of rubrofusarin isomer in the cultures
of F. graminearum. The extracted ion
chromatogram of m/z 287.0555 revealed
three ion peaks (Figure 3b), and the fragment ions were all identical with those of quinone
form of rubrofusarin, indicating they were the corresponding oxides
(Figure S3b–d). The quinone form
of rubrofusarin could not be separated from rubrofusarin isomer under
the present chromatographic condition. This explained why three ion
peaks but not four could be observed on the chromatogram.

Figure 3 UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap
MS analysis on the oxidation products of rubrofusarin
and its isomer in the rubrofusarin standard (a), metabolites of F. graminearum (b), and representative real grain
sample (c, rice sample).

A screening of quinone forms of rubrofusarin and its isomer
was
further carried out and the result confirmed their presence in the
real grain samples (Figures 3c and S3e,f). The relative intensity
revealed a comparable abundance of these two quinone forms, which
was contrary to the relative lower concentration of rubrofusarin isomer
in grains, indicating it could be more easily converted to its quinone
form compared with rubrofusarin.

Method Validation for the
Quantitation of Rubrofusarin in Grains
The presence of rubrofusarin,
rubrofusarin isomer, and their quinone
forms raised an urgent concern on their contamination levels in grains.
However, to date, no method has been reported for the quantitation
of these compounds. Considering the wide applicability of the previously
developed approach for a multianalysis of mycotoxins based on UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap
MS,27 it was directly utilized for the
quantitation of these compounds in grains. The method validation was
performed for rubrofusarin due to the lack of reference standards
for other compounds.

The calculated limit of detections (LODs)
of rubrofusarin were 1.6, 5.3, and 0.8 μg/kg for maize, wheat,
and rice matrix, respectively. The LOD for wheat matrix was much higher
than that for maize and rice matrixes. This was to some extent attributed
to the strongest ion suppression effect (40%) in wheat compared with
30 and 20% in maize and rice, respectively (Figure S4). And, therefore, the matrix-matched calibration curves
were established in the range of 0.2–100 μg/L for the
maize and rice matrix, and 0.8–100 μg/L for the wheat
matrix (Figure S4), which revealed a good
linearity with correlation coefficients greater than 0.999.

The mass resolution and accuracy were importance indexes that excluded
the mass interference of co-eluting compounds and guaranteed the specificity
and accuracy of quantitative results. And, therefore, the real mass
resolution and mass accuracy were observed for each determination.
The results revealed the real mass resolution of Q-Orbitrap MS proliferated
greatly with the increasing level of rubrofusarin spiked in the blank
matrix extracts (Figure S5). The minimum
mass resolution (full-width at half-maximum, RFWHM) was 54 000, 50 000, and 63 000 for
the maize, wheat, and rice matrix, respectively. This indicated the
co-eluting compounds with a mass difference less than 5.3 mmu relative
to rubrofusarin (A and A + 1, approximately 20 ppm for m/z of 272.0723 and 273.0757) would interfere with
its quantitation in the matrix samples. Therefore, a mass accuracy
tolerance of 20 ppm was used to extract the ion chromatogram of m/z of 272.0723 and 273.0757. The results
revealed that no obvious interfering components could be observed
around the ion peak of rubrofusarin in these three blank matrixes
(Figure S6). Furthermore, the obtained
mass accuracy of rubrofusarin was within ±1 ppm for all three
matrixes. These results were consistent with other studies using Q-Orbitrap
MS analyzers that had been validated to provide accurate quantitative
results.28,29

The mean recoveries (n = 9) ranged from 84.7 to
105.4% for all three matrixes with relative standard deviation (RSD)
in the range from 1.4 to 8.4% (Table 1). These results were in good agreement with the guideline
ranges (80–110%, RSD < 10%) imposed by Commission Decision
No. (EC) 2002/657.30

Quantitation of Rubrofusarin, Rubrofusarin
Isomer, and Their
Quinone Forms in Grains
The concentrations of rubrofusarin
isomer and their quinone forms were estimated by their peak areas
relative to rubrofusarin in the corresponding grain sample. Totally,
61 (29%) maize samples, 104 (80%) rice samples, and 70 (35%) wheat
samples were determined to be rubrofusarin positive, and the concentration
ranged from 3.278 to 33.82 μg/kg, from 0.815 to 61.86 μg/kg,
and from 7.362 to 47.24 μg/kg for the maize, rice, and wheat
samples, respectively (Figure 4). Rubrofusarin isomer could only be detected in trace in
rice and wheat samples and the concentration was below the LOD (not
shown). The quinone forms of rubrofusarin and rubrofusarin isomer
were observed to be positive only in the rice and wheat samples. The
estimated concentration of quinone form of rubrofusarin isomer ranged
from 0.8928 to 12.85 μg/kg (40 samples) and 0.2749–10.72
μg/kg (36 samples) for rice and wheat samples, respectively,
which were relative higher than those of quinone form of rubrofusarin
(Figure S7). These results indicated the
predominating occurrence of rubrofusarin and quinone form of rubrofusarin
isomer in the grains.

Comparison Between Rubrofusarin and the Known Mycotoxins in
Grains
The concentrations of the known mycotoxins including
trichothecene toxins, ZEN, fumonisins, aflatoxins, and OTA are summarized
in Table S1. Fumonisins, trichothecene
toxins, and aflatoxin B1 were the most prevalent mycotoxins found
in maize, wheat, and rice samples, respectively. The mean concentrations
of fumonisins B1, DON, and aflatoxin B1 were 2588, 1856, and 8.252
μg/kg for maize, wheat, and rice samples, respectively. Rubrofusarin,
DON, and ZEN could all be produced by F. graminearum; however, the significant correlation (p < 0.05)
between rubrofusarin and DON and ZEN could only be observed in wheat
samples (Figure 5).
The ratios of rubrofusarin to DON and ZEN were relatively higher in
rice samples compared with those in wheat and maize samples. These
results indicated that the generation of rubrofusarin might deserve
more attention in rice samples. However, further investigations of
high incidence of F. graminearum in
rice were necessary to confirm this observation.

rubrofusarin, DON, and ZEN in rice (a), wheat
(b), and maize (c) samples, respectively. The linear regression was
fitted for the wheat samples.

Fragmentation Studies of Rubrofusarin Using Q-Orbitrap MS
The Q-Orbitrap operating in ddMS2 mode provides accurate
masses of product ions and therefore offers a higher level of confidence
in analyte identification than a triple quadrupole mass analyzer in
the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) mode. The ddMS2 spectra
of rubrofusarin collected in this study revealed a mass accuracy within
±5 ppm for the rubrofusarin standard, spiked blank matrix, and
rubrofusarin-positive samples. The normalized collision energy setting
of 60 was selected to collect the standard ddMS2 spectra,
and the mass within the range of 180–273 were selected as the
characteristic fragment ions of rubrofusarin. Totally, 10 fragment
ions with relative higher abundance (>5%, 5 ions > 10%) were
screened
out (Table S2). The predicted formulas,
possible structures, and generation mechanisms are illustrated in Figure 6. Fragmentation begun
by the protonation of oxygen atom in rubrofusarin (m/z 273.0757), and this process could generate three
types of protonated products. These included the protonation of oxygen
in the methoxy group (ion 1A), the phenolic hydroxy group (ion 2A),
and the carbonyl group (ion 3A); the corresponding radical form could
also be generated (ions 1B and 3B). The i-cleavage
of ions 1A and 1B led to the loss of methoxy group and the formation
of [C14H11O4]+ ion A (m/z 243.0652) and [C14H8O4•]+ ion (m/z 240.0417), respectively. [C14H11O4]+ ion A could further undergo
rearrangement and cleavage to lose phenolic hydroxy, methylene, and
C3H4O, which corresponded to the formation of
[C14H11O3]+ ion (m/z 227.0703), [C13H9O4]+ ion (m/z 229.0495), and [C11H7O3]+ ion (m/z 187.0390), respectively.
The a-cleavage of ion 1B leaded to the loss of methyl
group and the formation of [C14H10O5•]+ ion (m/z 258.0523). [C14H10O5•]+ ion could further undergo i-cleavage and loss of carbonyl group to form [C13H10O4•]+ ion A (m/z 230.0574), which subsequently lost
one molecular H2O to form [C13H8O3•]+ ion (m/z 212.0469, i-cleavage). Ion 2A could undergo a-cleavage
and then re reaction to loss HCO and form [C14H11O4]+ ion B (m/z 243.0652). [C14H11O4]+ ion B could further lose HCO and the methoxy
group to form [C12H9O2]+ ion (m/z 185.0579). The i-cleavage of ion 2A would loss one molecular H2O to form [C15H11O4]+ ion (m/z 255.0652), which would
lose the methoxy group to form [C14H11O3]+ ion (m/z 227.0703).
Ion 3A would undergo either a-cleavage and then rd reaction or a-cleavage and then rearrangement
and i-cleavage to lose HCO and form [C14H11O4]+ ion C (m/z 243.0652). Ion 3B could undergo either subsequent a-cleavage, rearrangement, and i-cleavage
or rearrangement, a-cleavage, rearrangement, and i-cleavage to form [C13H10O4•]+ ion B (m/z 230.0574). These results indicated a wealth of information
could be obtained from the ddMS2 spectra that allowed for
advanced data interpretation to provide solid confidence for the identification
of the rubrofusarin in grains.

The good mass accuracy and full
mass scan by Q-Orbitrap MS were
validated to be useful for the retrospective analysis of unnoticed
fungal metabolites in grains, as illustrated by the identification,
confirmation, and quantitation of rubrofusarin, rubrofusarin isomer,
and their quinone forms in this study. These toxic metabolites were
confirmed to be co-occurrence with the regulated Fusarium mycotoxins like DON and ZEN. And, therefore, the contribution of
these compounds should be considered when assessing the overall toxicity
of Fusarium mycotoxins in grains. However, further
data including the detailed toxicity and occurrence levels in grains
are necessary to evaluate the exposure risk of these compounds from
diet intake.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Materials
Rubrofusarin was purchased
in neat form from Abcam (Shanghai, China). HPLC-grade acetonitrile
and methanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).
MS-grade formic acid and ammonium formate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Positive- and negative-ion solutions used to calibrate
the Q-Orbitrap MS were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.
(San Jose, CA). MilliQ water (18.2 MΩ) was used in all solution
preparation.

Standards Preparation
Stock standard
solutions (200
μg/mL) of rubrofusarin were prepared by dissolving 1.0 mg of
the standard in 5 mL of acetonitrile. A working standard solution
of 2.0 μg/mL was prepared by diluting the stock standard solution
with water/extraction solution (1:1, v:v; extraction solution consist
of 70:29:1 acetonitrile/water/acetic acid, v:v:v). Stock solutions
and working standard solutions were stored at −20 °C.

Eleven standard solutions of rubrofusarin (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25,
0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/L) were prepared
by successive dilution of the working standard solutions with water/extraction
solution or water/matrix-matched extraction solution (1:1, v:v), respectively.

Sample Preparation
Maize, wheat, and rice samples were
collected from Heilongjinag, Shandong, Hebei, and Sichuan province
of China after grain harvest. A total of 540 samples including 210
maize, 200 wheat, and 130 rice samples were analyzed. As previously
described,31 bulk grains were milled and
filtered through a 40-mesh sieve. A volume of 20 mL of extraction
solution was added to 5.00 ± 0.05 g of ground sample in Nunc
50 mL centrifuge tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA).
Samples were extracted for 30 min using a high-speed vortex mixer
(2000 rpm, Targin, VX-III, China) and followed by centrifugation for
5 min at 5000 g, 25 °C. A 500 μL portion of the extract
was transferred to a 1.5 mL polyethylene tube (Corning Inc., Corning,
NY), followed by the addition of 500 μL water. The tube was
vortexed for 15 s and the mixture was filtered through a 13 mm ×
0.2 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) syringe filter (Pall Life Sciences,
Ann Arbor, MI). The filtrate was directly transferred into an autosampler
vial (CNW, Shanghai, China).

Recovery Studies
Three blank samples
were selected
for maize, wheat, and rice matrix. Spiking solution volumes of 100
μL were added to the blank samples to achieve spiking levels
of LOQ, 20, 40, and 100 μg/kg for wheat, maize, and rice matrixes,
respectively. The spiked blank samples were subject to extraction
procedure as mentioned for the sample preparation described above.

Limit of Detection and Quantitation Studies
The LOD
and LOQ values were determined using blank samples spiked with different
concentrations of rubrofusarin. LOD and LOQ were calculated as the
minimum concentration of rubrofusarin that produced chromatographic
peak areas with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and 10, respectively.

UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap MS Analysis
A Dionex ultrahigh-performance
chromatograph coupled with a quadrupole orbital trap mass spectrometer
(Q-Orbitrap MS, QExactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA)
was employed for all the analysis. The UHPLC method was performed
on a Waters CORTECSTM UPLC C18 column (100 mm × 2. 1 mm, 1. 6
μm) using a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The mobile phases were
MilliQ water containing 0.1% formic acid and 0.1% ammonium formate
(A) and HPLC-grade methanol containing 0.1% formic acid and 0.1% ammonium
formate (B). The multistep elution procedure was performed as follows:
0–2 min, 90% B; 2–3 min, 90–80% B; 3–4
min, 80–79% B; 4–5 min, 79–74% B; 5–7
min, 74% B; 7–10.5 min, 74–40% B; 10.5–16.5 min,
40–25% B; 16.5–17 min, 25–5% B; 17–20
min, 5% B; 20–21 min, 5–90% B; and 21–24 min,
90% B. The column temperature was set at 40 °C and the injection
volume was set at 2 μL.

The Q-orbital trap MS was equipped
with a heated electrospray ionization probe and a collision cell to
carry out higher-energy collision dissociation-based tandem MS experiments
(MS2). The Q-Orbitrap MS was operated in either full-scan
MS or full-scan data-dependent MS2 (ddMS2) mode
for quantitative or qualitative analysis. The instrument was tuned
and the mass accuracy was calibrated each week and any time when mass
accuracy of analyte exceeded 1 ppm. The instrument and data collection
parameters are listed in Table S3.

F. graminearum Cultivation
Strain of F. graminearum was previously
isolated from the grain samples and stored on potato dextrose agar
medium in our laboratory. For the culture on the maize powder, 1 mL
of spore suspension (about 1 × 106 spores/mL) was
added to 50 g autoclaved blank maize powder in a 250 mL conical flask
and the moisture content was adjusted to 30% (w:w). The matrix medium
was kept at 28 °C for the indicated time (totally 30 days) and
then subject to solvent extraction as described above for the sample
preparation after lyophilization.

Data Analysis
From the raw data, analytes were identified
by their retention time (tR) precursor
ions, A + 1, and A + 2 isotopes, MS/MS mass spectra, and prediction
of molecular composition from the extracted ion chromatogram using
the Xcalibur Qual Browser (V. 3.0 SP1.48, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
San Jose, CA) with a mass accuracy (δM) tolerance
of 5 ppm. The δM for a measured ion was calculated
by dividing the difference between the theoretical and measured m/z by the theoretical m/z and expressed as part-per-million (ppm)  Screening and quantitation of the
analytes
were carried out using Trace finder software (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
San Jose, CA). Mass Frontier (V. 7.01 SR1, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
San Jose, CA) software was used to predict the molecular structures
in the fragmentation studies.
