A novel
metal organic framework (MOF)-based composite was synthesized
on a Cu substrate via a two-step route. An amorphous iron oxide/hydroxide
layer was first deposited on a Cu foil through a sol–gel process;
then, Fe-NH2-Mil-101 was grown using both the iron oxide/hydroxide
matrix, which provided the Fe3+ centers needed for MOF
formation, and 2-aminoterephthalic acid ethanol solution. This innovative
synthetic strategy is a convenient approach to grow metal oxide/hydroxide
and MOF composite films. Structural, chemical, and morphological characterizations
suggest that the obtained composite is made up of both the α-FeOOH
goethite and the NH2-Mil-101 phases featuring a hybrid
heterostructure. The electrochemical features of the composite structure
were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The
impedance behavior of the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 films
indicates that they can be used as efficient high surface area metal
hydroxide/MOF-based electrodes for applications such as energy storage
and sensing.

Introduction
Metal organic framework (MOF)-based hybrid
composites are promising
platforms for the development of innovative electrochemical systems
such as supercapacitors, batteries, and sensors.1−4 The combination of individual
components in a common matrix makes it possible to optimize specific
chemical–physical properties guaranteeing multifunctionality
and versatility of the composite.5,6 In particular,
MOF/metal oxide (MO) hybrid materials have been researched with the
aim of developing next-generation electrodes for lithium and/or sodium
batteries and for photo-electrochemical water splitting devices.7−10 In these systems, MOFs offer flexible coordination networks characterized
by high surface areas, low densities, and tunable pore sizes.11−13 Additionally, appropriate functionalities can be added to the MOF
organic building blocks through postsynthetic modifications in order
to modulate MOF properties.14,15 Despite their advantages,
pure MOFs are not usually used for electrochemical applications because
of their poor chemical stability and low electrical conductivity,
which reduce their energy storage capabilities.3,16 For
this reason, MOFs are usually used as precursors of composite carbon–MO
electrodes as they can be converted, through thermal annealing, into
MO nanoparticles and into porous carbon networks.17−19 In particular,
transition MOs (such as Fe2O3, CoO, Cu2O, RuO2, and TiO2), are efficient active electrodes
capable of performing reversible conversion reactions guaranteeing
accurate redox potential control.20−22 In addition, the hybrid
nanostructures of the MOs embedded in a carbon matrix improve the
electrochemical performances compared to those of pure oxides because
of short-ion diffusion and their increased conductivity.23,24 Among the various transition MOs, iron oxides have been widely employed
as anode materials because of them being environmentally friendly
and characterized by high theoretical capacity, high corrosion resistance,
and wide working potential ranges.25,26 Several iron
oxide and hydroxide systems have been developed with different morphologies,
porosities, and crystalline degrees.27−29 Amorphous or low crystalline
iron oxide or FeOOH porous materials can be used as highly efficient
electrodes, especially if defect sites increasing ion mobility and
improving electrolyte diffusion are inserted into the crystal lattice.30−32

The most common synthetic methods to achieve iron oxide-based
electrodes
are sol–gel routes and MOF pyrolysis.33,34 In particular, Fe-Mil-88 and Fe-Mil-101 are the MOF precursors usually
used for pyrolysis.35,36 These precursors collapse after
pyrolysis, shaping conductive mesoporous carbon shells around the
iron oxide core, thus overcoming the problem of the low conductivity
of the MOF coating.37 On the other hand,
it is important to develop synthetic routes that, unlike previous
methods,35,36 do not require high temperatures to obtain
low-impedance hybrid composite films consisting of transition MOs
coated with undecomposed MOFs. In fact, this approach could lead to
new and efficient electrode materials capable of exploiting the structural
versatility and high surface area of MOFs. To this aim, it is important
to understand the effects of surface chemistry and synthetic conditions
on the direct growth of MOFs on the electrode surface38,39 and to evaluate how the obtained coating affects the electrochemical
properties. For this reason, in this study, we describe the growth
of a novel MOF-based hybrid film on a copper foil, consisting of Fe-NH2-Mil-101 embedded in α-FeOOH matrix. The adopted synthesis
is made up of two reaction steps: the first is the sol–gel
deposition of amorphous iron oxides/hydroxides; the second is the
direct growth of Fe-NH2-Mil-101 on the iron oxide/hydroxide
film using a solution containing the MOF organic building block only,
namely, 2-aminoterephthalate acid. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) showed promising electrochemical features for the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 hybrid system in terms of charge transfer resistance,
capacitance, and diffusion resistance.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101
Composite
Figure 1 shows the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
images of the sol–gel deposited amorphous layer (Figure 1a) and of the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite (Figure 1b,c) obtained through a 4 h MOF-growth process. Figure 1d shows the morphology
of the bare copper foil. The sol–gel deposited iron oxide/hydroxide
film is a homogenous and continuous layer characterized by a “bunch”
morphology, typical of iron oxide materials (Figure 1a). NH2-Mil-101 growth into the
amorphous matrix increases the layer porosity (Figure 1b) through the formation of agglomerated
clusters of rod-like crystals (Figure 1c), the typical shape of crystalline α-FeOOH
(goethite). Note that the films obtained through an 8 h MOF-growth
process led to a poor substrate coverage, likely because long reaction
times determine too much FeOOH consumption, which reduces the adhesion
between the copper substrate and the MOF crystals, thus favoring MOF
crystal dispersion in the ethanol solution.

iron oxide/hydroxide layer deposited via sol–gel
on a Cu foil, (b) low and (c) high-magnification SEM images of the
α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite; and (d) bare Cu foil
surface.

To understand the nature of the
features observed in the FE-SEM
images, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping of the characteristic
elements was also performed. Figure 2 compares the morphological images of FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 films (Figure 2a) with the distribution of carbon, iron, and copper (Figure 2b,c,–d, respectively).

the intensity of C Kα (b), Fe Kα (c), and Cu Kα
(d) signals of the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite.

From Figure 2, it
is evident that the higher carbon signal corresponds to the agglomerated
structures, suggesting that they contain carbon-rich species such
as NH2-Mil-101 crystals. As expected, in these regions,
the intensity of the copper signal is low because of the agglomerated
structures covering the substrate. The iron signal is present throughout
the analyzed area, but its intensity is lower in the areas corresponding
to the agglomerates. All these observations suggest that the agglomerated
structures are rich in MOF crystals, whose main component is carbon
and in which the density of iron atoms is lower than that of the FeOOH
ones. The areas without the MOF-based structures, which show a lower
carbon concentration, are mainly constituted of the unreacted iron
oxide film.

The lattice structure of the obtained films was
investigated by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The XRD pattern of the sol–gel
FeOOH layer does not show any peak except for the two peaks at 2θ
= 43.3° and 2θ = 50.4° related to the Cu substrate.
According to the low temperature used for the postdeposition annealing
(150 °C), this finding implies that the layer is amorphous. On
the other hand, after the NH2-Mil-101 growth, new features
are observed in the diffraction pattern (Figure 3). In particular, in the range 2θ =
5–7°, a convolution of several contributions can be assigned
to the Mil-101 film, related to (333), (511), and (531) crystallographic
planes. In addition, a weak and noisy signal at 2θ ≈
17° is found and can be attributed to (222) and (422) planes
of the same structure (Mil-101).40,41 We notice
that, unlike the measurement on powders, specific features are not
visible in the 2θ range between 2° and 5° because
of the low amount of material, the copper foil roughness, and the
high background caused by the reflection at grazing angles. As additional
contributions, the peaks at 2θ = 22.2°, 26.4°, and
36.4° can be assigned to the (110), (021), and (111) planes of
crystalline α-FeOOH (goethite), respectively, likely formed
during the growth of the NH2-Mil-101 film.42

Further information on the nature of the obtained
composite was
obtained through scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)/transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analyses performed upon scratching a portion
of the sample on the TEM grid. Low- and high-magnification STEM images
reported in Figure 4a,b show the contrast difference between the dark and bright zones
suggesting the presence of different density components. The darker
zones (gray arrow), characterized by faceted contours, indicate the
presence of a lower density component and are, therefore, attributable
to the MOF matrix. The brighter areas (green arrow), which have less-defined
shapes are because of the higher density component probably related
to iron oxide. The TEM morphology in Figure 4c shows, in addition to the agglomerated
small grains, the presence of well-defined isolated squared crystals
of about 200 nm-size each. The sample composition (Figure 4d) was assessed through electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. The presence of similar
amounts of Fe and N is consistent with the NH2-Mil-101
molecular formula.

gray arrows indicate bright and dark areas, respectively; (d) estimated
sample composition from EELS measurements.

Complementary information on the nature of the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 film was obtained by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR). Figure 5 shows
the spectra of the sol–gel deposited film (green) and the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite (dark). The spectrum of the sol–gel
layer is consistent with the presence of iron oxides/hydroxides. The
most intense signal is the broad band at 3430 cm–1 assigned to the −OH stretching vibrations of iron hydroxides
and adsorbed water.42 Signals at 860 and
at 660 cm–1 are because of the Fe–O stretching
modes typical of iron oxides and hydroxides.42 The sharp peak at 2430 cm–1 is likely because
of CO32–, which is typically formed by
the reaction of FeOOH with atmospheric CO2,43 whereas the peaks in the 1660–1560 cm–1 region are because of the −OH bending vibrations.42,44 Note that, as expected for inorganic compounds, oxide/hydroxide
signals are much weaker than the MOF ones. In fact, the IR spectrum
of the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 film shows much stronger
signals, mainly due to the terephthalate ligand. In particular, the
signals at 1590–1510 and at 1300–1400 cm–1 are typical of the COO– asymmetric and symmetric
stretchings of the terphthalate ligands.41,45,46 However, the presence of unreacted terephthalic
acid molecules is also detected through the signal at 1690 cm–1.45,47 The doublet at 3220 and 3140
cm–1 is assigned to the N–H asymmetric and
symmetric stretches of the amino group. In addition, in the 1700–1100
cm−1 region, the signals due to the C–C and
C–N deformation vibrations of the aminoterephthalic acid aromatic
ring are also present.41 Finally, the weak
and broad shoulder at 3430 cm–1 can be associated
to the −OH stretching of FeOOH and adsorbed water.

sol–gel on a Cu foil and the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101
composite (dark).

Information on the chemical
nature of the composite surface was
obtained through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 6 shows the high resolution
XPS spectral region of the composite components: Fe 2p3/2, O 1s, C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s. The Fe 2p3/2 signal (Figure 6a) consists of two
main components at 709.0 and 711.4 eV indicating the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+, respectively.47,48 A third low band is because of the Fe2+ shake-up at about
715 eV. The Fe3+ component can be because of both the α-FeOOH
and NH2-Mil-101 phases, while the Fe2+ component
is likely because of amorphous FeO.49 The
shape of the C 1s band (Figure 6b) is the result of the contribution of different species.
The most intense peak in this region is observed at 285.0 eV, and
it is typically associated with aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon
atoms and to the “adventitious” carbon. The featured
peak at 288.9 eV is characteristic of the carboxylic groups. However,
the position of this peak is intermediate between the value (289.3
eV) reported for the COOH groups of terephthalic acid45 and the typical values (288.6–288.2 eV) reported
for the carboxylate (COO–) groups.45,47 This feature can be, therefore, the result of the contribution of
two components at 289.3 and at 288.6 eV due to adsorbed terephthalic
acid and the terephthalate ligands of the MOF, respectively. This
result is consistent with the FTIR outcomes, which suggests the presence
of free terephthalic acid besides the terephthalate ligand of the
NH2-Mil-101 framework. The last component at around 286.1
eV can be associated to the adventitious C–O species and to
the C–N atoms of the aminoterephthalic/terephthalate species.
As expected, a N 1s signal at 400.2 eV (Figure 6c) is also present because of the aforementioned
aminoterephthalic/terephthalate species. The spectrum of O 1s (Figure 6d) shows a main component
at 532.1 eV and two shoulders at 529.2 and 533.9 eV. The main component
is consistent with the presence of hydroxides and the carboxylate
groups of the MOF. The weak signal at low binding energies (529.2
eV) can be assigned to MOs, while the shoulder at 533.9 eV is likely
because of adsorbed water.

Electrochemical Behavior of the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 Composite
EIS is considered as a powerful
tool
to get insight into the electrochemical behavior of the MOF-based
composite system.50,51Figure 7a compares the Nyquist plots (real part vs
imaginary part of the impedance) of the bare Cu foil, amorphous sol–gel
iron oxides/hydroxides (top inset), and the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite (bottom inset).

mV superimposed ac voltage in the frequency range 104 to
10–1 Hz in 0.1 M KCl electrolytic solution containing
5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–. The insets
are the magnified region of the Nyquist plots of the iron oxide/hydroxide
film (top inset) and the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite
(bottom inset) and (b) equivalent circuit model used to fit the Nyquist
plots: an ESR is connected in series with a CPE in parallel with the
charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a
Warburg element (W).

All plots display a semicircular
arc in the high frequency region
and an almost straight line in the low frequency region. The beginning
of the semicircle is the equivalent series resistance (ESR), which
represents the combined resistance of the electrolyte, active material/substrate
interface, and the substrate. The semicircle is because of the double
layer capacitance, described by the constant phase element (CPE) by
taking into account the nonideality of the capacitor, in parallel
with the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/electrode interface
(Rct). The straight line is related to
the diffusion resistance of the ions within the electrode material
and is represented by a Warburg element (CPE with 45° phase)
in series with Rct. This peculiar shape
can be fitted based on the equivalent circuit model shown in Figure 7b.52 The resulting fitting parameters are reported in Table 1. Except for the ESR
values, the iron oxide/hydroxide film and the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite present similar circuit parameters, as
expected from the very similar impedance curves shown in Figure 7a. In fact, ESR reduces
after the sol–gel deposition of the iron oxide/hydroxide film
(40 → 22 Ω) and increases after the formation of the
hybrid NH2-Mil-101 structure (22 → 44 Ω) because
of the lower conductivity of the MOF. However, the Rct of the iron oxide/hydroxide films and the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 samples is almost the same (∼1100 Ω),
and it is significantly lower than the one for the Cu foil (∼5000
Ω). Moreover, the CPE values of the iron oxide/hydroxide film
and the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 are similar (∼50–65
μF s(n–1)) and obviously
higher than those of the Cu foil (∼2 μF s(n–1)) because of their larger surface area.
Also, the value of n indicates that the capacitive
behavior of the Cu foil (n = 0.885) is close to that
of an ideal capacitor (n = 1), while both the iron
oxide/hydroxide film and α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 (n ≈ 0.67) behave like a nonideal capacitor because
of their porous nature. Finally, the value of the Warburg coefficient AW of the iron oxide/hydroxide film and α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 suggests an easier diffusion of ions within the electrode.
Therefore, the α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite electrode
offers the synergistic properties of the two components (α-FeOOH
and MOF) without deteriorating the electrochemical features of the
classical iron oxide/hydroxide electrodes.

Conclusions
A novel two-step synthetic
strategy was developed to grow Fe-based
NH2-Mil-101 composite films on Cu foil at low temperature
(80 °C). An amorphous iron oxide/hydroxide layer deposited via
sol–gel was used to provide, directly on a Cu electrode surface,
the Fe3+ centers needed for the MOF growth. A porous α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 composite film was then grown using an ethanol solution
containing the organic building block only (2-aminoterephthalic acid).
The proposed synthetic approach is fast, makes use of mild conditions,
and so, it is a convenient protocol to develop hybrid MO/MOF films.
EIS measurements have shown that, despite the poor conductivity of
the MOF resulting in a high ESR value, both iron oxides/hydroxides
and α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101 have similar circuit parameters.
In particular, both systems behave like nonideal capacitors with a
value of charge transfer resistance of about 1100 Ω, which is
lower than that of the Cu benchmark. Despite the insulating character
of NH2-Mil-101, α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101’s
unique impedance behavior makes it a promising electrode capable of
combining the structural and chemicophysical MOF properties with the
typical electrochemical characteristics of iron hydroxide materials.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate, 2-aminoterephthalic
acid, ethanol, acetone, isopropanol acetylacetone, methoxyethyelene,
potassium chloride, and potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

Sol–Gel Deposition
of Amorphous Iron Oxide/Hydroxide
Layer
Iron oxide/hydroxide layer was deposited on copper
foil through sol–gel deposition using iron(III) nitrate as
the precursor and 2-methoxyethanol as the solvent. First, Fe(NO3)3 × 9H2O was solubilized in a
solution of 2-methoxyethanol and acetylacetone in a molar ratio of
10:1. The latter solution (0.2 M) was stirred and kept at room temperature
for 2 h. Then, the precursor solution (15 mL) was dropped on the copper
foil and cleaned with a mixture of acetone/isopropanol/ethanol in
a spin-coater at a spinning rate of 1000–2000 rpm for 30 s.
Four spin-coating steps were repeated to increase the layer thickness.
In addition, a drying treatment at 100 °C was carried out after
each cycle to allow a suitable adhesion on the surface. The sample
was, then, annealed at 150 °C (heating rate of 5 °C/min)
for 4 h to eliminate the organic components without inducing film
crystallization.

Growth of α-FeOOH/NH2-Mil-101
Films
Composite films were directly grown from solution on
the amorphous
oxide/hydroxide layer, which act as the source of Fe3+ ions.
In particular, the samples of iron oxide/hydroxide layer deposited
on the Cu foil were dipped into 2-aminoterephthalic acid (0.16 g)
and ethanol solution (15 mL). The system was kept under reflux for
4 or 8 h in an 80 °C oil bath. Samples were then washed in ethanol
and dried under N2 flow.

Characterization
FE-SEM (Zeiss Supra35 FE-SEM) was
used to observe sample morphology. EDX analyses were performed using
an INCA-Oxford windowless detector.

Transmission FTIR measurements
were recorded on JASCO FTIR 430, using the KBr pellet technique, with
100 scans collected per spectrum (scan range 560–4000 cm–1, resolution 4 cm–1).

XPS
spectra were run using a PHI 5600 multitechnique ESCA-Auger
spectrometer equipped with a standard Mg Kα X-ray source. Analyses
were carried out with a photoelectron take-off angle of 45° (relative
to the sample surface) with an acceptance angle of ±7°.
The XPS binding energy scale was calibrated by centering the C 1s
peak because of hydrocarbon moieties and “adventitious”
carbon at 285.0 eV.

XRD patterns were collected with a D8 Discover
(Bruker AXS) diffractometer
equipped with a high-precision goniometer (0.0001°), a thin-film
attachment (long soller slits), and a Cu Kα source. The acquisitions
were done using grazing incidence geometry with an incident angle
of 0.4°.

TEM and STEM analyses were done in bright and
dark field, respectively.
Measurements were performed after scratching the sample on a Cu-lacey-C
grid using a JEOL JEM 2010 F microscope operating at 200 kV. EELS
analyses were performed using the Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF 2001).

EIS analysis was performed at room temperature by using a VersaSTAT
4 Potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, USA) and a three-electrode
setup with samples (1 cm2 immersed area) as working electrodes,
a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode.
A 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– was used as the supporting electrolyte. EIS measurements were recorded
at 0 V versus open circuit potential with a 10 mV superimposed ac
voltage in the frequency range 104 to 10–1 Hz. EIS spectra were fitted by using EIS spectrum analyser software.
