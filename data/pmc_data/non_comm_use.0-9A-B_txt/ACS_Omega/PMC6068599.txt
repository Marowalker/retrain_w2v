Antigen recognition
by antibodies plays an important role in human
biology and in the development of diseases. This interaction provides
a basis for multiple diagnostic assays and is a guide for treatments.
We have developed dihydropyridine-based fluorophores that form stable
complexes with double-stranded DNA and upon recognition of the antibodies
to DNA (anti-DNA) provide an optical response. The fluorophores described
herein have advantageous optical properties compared to those of the
currently available dyes making them valuable for research and clinical
diagnostics. By studying a series of novel fluorophores, crucial parameters
for the design were established, providing the required sensitivity
and specificity in the detection of antibodies. Using these DNA–fluorophore
complexes in a direct immunofluorescence assay, antibodies to DNA
are specifically detected in 80 patients diagnosed with an autoimmune
disease, systemic lupus erythematosus. Positivity indicated by emission
change of α-(4′-O-methoxyphenyl)-2-furyl
dihydropyridine strongly correlates with other disease biomarkers
and autoimmune arthritis.

1 Introduction
Antibodies
are proteins of key importance that provide defense
against cancer, bacteria, and viruses.1 However, in autoimmune diseases, antibodies attack one’s
own cells and tissues.2 To prevent the
disease development, autoimmune antibodies have to be diagnosed early
and a treatment has to be started.

Among others, antibodies
to nuclear components of cells (antinuclear
antibodies) and to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are distinctive biomarkers
of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic autoimmune disease
with multiple manifestations, and life-threatening damage to human
organism.3,4 Recent studies point at the broad range
of autoimmune conditions that involve highly reactive anti-double-stranded
DNA (a-dsDNA) antibodies as well.5

Detection of antibodies is currently performed either by indirect
immunoassays or by direct detection methods.6 The indirect methods are usually carried out by variants of the
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and are widely used.7 Direct detection can be done by fluorescence
microscopy, surface plasmon resonance, or fluorometry.8−10 ELISA is highly sensitive but time demanding and rather costly.
The direct methods are simpler in handling, more accurate in target
quantification, and inexpensive compared with ELISA.8−10

The key to successful detection of any antibody is a properly
designed
and highly pure antigen.10 Synthetic oligonucleotides
represent an emerging class of antigens for the detection and study
of autoimmune antibodies. We and others recently proved the utility
of rationally designed dsDNA molecules in the diagnostics of SLE.10−12 Using these antigens and the commercially available dye Eva green,
we were able to detect the antibody–DNA interaction by a simple
fluorometry assay (Figure 1).10 Several studies addressed
the issue of the DNA sequence recognition by the antibodies.10−14 Nevertheless, new dyes with improved properties for the direct immunofluorescence
are on demand. In particular, high optical sensitivity to DNA and
antibodies would be advantageous to increase specificity of the assay.

principle of the immunofluorescence assay; (b) commercially
available DNA binding dyes and novel fluorophores used in this work.
Eva green (1), thiazole orange (2), and novel dihydropyridines (DHPs 3–8).

DNA origami is an exciting research and diagnostic tool that
allows
for sensitive detection of a broad range of targets.15 Origami can be folded into the various shapes, ranging
from a nanobox to flat sheet, by adding a set of synthetic oligonucleotide
primers to the large viral DNA strand.15 Reaching a size of 100 nm, DNA origami has a plethora of binding
sites for fluorophores, small drugs, and biomolecules, being hence
an excellent tool to enhance the recognition and detection efficacy
per sample volume.15 Specifically, a complex
of DNA origami with noncovalent DNA binding dye can be used as an
antigen for the detection of anti-DNA antibodies in biofluids (Figure 1a). Upon the antibody
binding, a fluorophore molecules get released from the DNA origami,
providing a simple fluorescence read out for the assay.16

We aimed at developing novel fluorophores
with advantageous properties
in the direct detection of human antibodies. To address this, we designed,
synthesized, and tested novel derivatives of dihydropyridine (DHP; Figure 1b). DHP is a parent
of a class of molecules that effectively recognizes proteins.17 In particular, DHPs are well known in pharmacology
as L-type calcium channel blockers, used in the treatment of hypertension.
Our rationale for choosing the DHP scaffold is that the fine tuning
of the substitution pattern allows for the optimization of the DNA/protein
recognition and of its optical properties. DHP analogues were additionally
decorated with planar aromatic moieties and hydrophilic substituents
that can provide stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds with large
DNA origami.10,16 In this article, we describe
the design and synthesis of these new fluorophores and prove their
ability to specifically detect human antibodies to DNA in blood samples.

2 Results and Discussion
Optical sensitivity of organic
molecules to their microenvironment
is a fundament of multiple tests. However, several biological phenomena
require a fine tuning of the sensor’s optical properties. A
particularly challenging task is to develop a fluorophore that allows
for a sensitive and specific detection by interaction with antigen
and antibodies. Commercially available fluorophores are developed
to effectively recognize either DNA or proteins, but none allow us
to monitor the switch in recognition of these two biomolecules.

In this study, our goal was to develop a fluorescent molecule that
would allow us to form a bright complex with well-defined DNA origami
structures able to bind and detect anti-dsDNA antibodies. To address
this, we started with a scaffold that is well known to bind to proteins,
dihydropyridine (DHP). By chemical functionalization we achieved the
required sensitivity and specificity of a DHP–furan derivative
and proved its efficacy in a direct immunofluorescence assay.

For the fluorophore design, we used available knowledge on DNA
binding by organic molecules, which combine π–π
interactions and hydrogen bonding.15,16 Furthermore,
extending the aromatic system is known to increase the fluorescent
quantum yield and redshift the emission wavelengths.18 Therefore, we functionalized position 4 of the DHPs (shown
in Figure 1) with several
aromatic residues, potentially influencing optical properties and
biorecognition. For compound 3, we introduced additional
aromatic substituents at the furan, resulting in compounds 6, 7, and 8 (Figure 1). Methyl groups were removed in several
fluorophores to study the effect on DNA and antibody recognition.

Owing to their medical significance, the synthesis of DHP derivatives
has been widely explored.19,20 A straightforward scaffold
diversification was developed for the rapid preparation of all of
the designed fluorophores. The synthesis of the fluorophores is shown
in Scheme 1. In brief,
boronic acids 9 were reacted with furfurals 11 resulting in derivatives 12–13.
Incubation of products 12–13, along
with commercially available aldehydes 15–18, with 3-aminocyclohex-2-en-1-one (14) and
3-oxo-N-arylbutanamides (19) provided
the DHPs 3–8 in up to 87% yields
(see the details on synthesis and characterization in Supporting Information, Chapter 2).

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Dihydropyridines 3–8
R1 = 2-furyl (3, 15), 2-naphthyl (4, 16), styryl (5, 17), α-Br-2-furyl (6, 18), α-Ph-2-furyl (7, 12), and α-(4′-O-methoxyphenyl)-2-furyl
(8, 13). R2 = H or Me. IPA =
isopropyl alcohol.

Novel fluorophores were
evaluated in three steps. First, optical
properties and biorecognition of each fluorophore were investigated.
Second, the fluorophores with optimal performance were screened against
a panel of dsDNA probes to obtain the brightest complex. Third, the
selected fluorophore–DNA complexes were tested in a direct
immunofluorescence assay of a-dsDNA in human samples.

Individual
fluorophores were analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy
and fluorometry. As expected, the substitution pattern had a strong
effect on the optical properties of the fluorophores, for example,
fluorescence maximum for compounds 3 vs 8 shifted from 430 to 470 nm in 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
pH 7.2 (Supporting Information, Chapter
2). Quantum yields also varied dramatically, with highest values for
the fluorophore complexes 4, 5, and 8 (0.17–0.40). The molar extinction was similar for
all of the dyes and somewhat lower than for previously used thiazole
orange, 2 (Supporting Information, Table S1).

In general, all of the fluorophores showed
increased fluorescence
in the presence of calf thymus DNA (CTD) (Supporting Information, Figure S1). However, compounds 3–4, without DNA, showed no response to the addition
of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Remarkably, compound 3 nicely discriminated the DNA (CTD) over a protein (BSA; Supporting
Information, Table S1). Fluorescence intensity
of compound 3 was slightly increased with CTD and quenched
by 2-fold upon addition of 1 mM BSA (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Among all dyes, compound 4 and 8 gave highest brightness (FB) with CTD.

Although compound 3 showed good discrimination of
antibodies in SLE-positive sera vs controls, it had a relatively weak
fluorescence compared to that of compounds 7 and 8 bound to DNA (Supporting Information, Table S1). Moreover, its absorbance maximum was below 380
nm, which is not suitable for screening by a conventional plate reader.

To gain more information on the fluorophore–DNA complexes,
we applied a model dsDNA, a 30-mer fragment of the human genome. Using
short dsDNA allowed us to perform thermal denaturation (Tm) and circular dichroism (CD) studies (Figure 2a,b). These well-established
methods reveal the stability of the DNA duplex and its structure in
the presence of different concentrations of the fluorophores.21,22 Eva green and thiazole orange were used as controls. It was surprising
that the dyes had a relatively small effect on the thermal stability
of model dsDNA (change in Tm ± 1.5
°C, with a measurement precision of ±0.5 °C). Similarly
to Eva green and thiazole orange, CD studies indicated that DHP derivatives 3–5 had little effect on the secondary
structure of dsDNA (Supporting Information, Chapter 3). A possible interaction mode of fluorophores with DNA
could be an intercalation.18 However, the
observed lack of fluorescence quenching and unchanged CD and Tm profiles for compounds 3–5 vs DNA exclude the potential intercalation.18

TEM characterization of prism A incubated with no dye (c), and with
250 mM dye 8 added during annealing. For every sample, two chosen
representative TEM images are shown with a scale bar of 200 nm. This
image gallery confirms the stability of the prism A in the presence
of the dye.

To study the effect of
the dyes on the stability of large DNA origami,
we applied agarose gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Supporting Information, Figures S5,S6 and 2c,d). For these studies, we selected
two representative dyes, 3 and 8, and prism
A. Agarose gel of prism A incubated with no dye, 3, or 8 in increasing concentrations of 50, 250, and 500 mM, revealed
a faster migration of the front band. This is evident of proper folding
of the prism A in all cases (Supporting Information, Figure S6A). TEM images also confirm a well-defined structure
for prism A when dyes 3 and 8 are added
(see Supporting Information Figure S6E for 3–prism A TEM).

We aimed at finding the optimal
DNA antigen to form a bright and
stable complex with fluorophores 5 and 8. We chose 5 and 8 due to their high brightness
and affinity toward dsDNA (see Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2). Recent studies show that large
well-defined three-dimensional (3D) DNA origami structures are advantageous
in terms of brightness in the direct immunofluorescence assay.10,16,23 Following this lead, we screened
five previously reported origami structures: box, platform, ring,
and two prism variants (Figure 1b).10,24−26 Annealing of
origami was done as previously described,10 and the dye of interest was added during the thermal ramp at 65
°C (see Supporting Information Chapter
4 for details). The resulting complexes were studied by fluorometry
in PBS buffer (Supporting Information, Figure S6B) and upon addition of human sera containing antibodies
to DNA (Figure 3; SLE1–2).
In the absence of sera, prism A and CTD formed bright complexes with 5, whereas 8 had the brightest signal when bound
to platform and prism A. The discrimination of binding by fluorescence
was highest for 8, reaching 4.7-fold change of intensity,
compared with 2.1-fold change showed by 5 (Supporting
Information, Figure S6B).

Figure 3 Immunofluorescence screening
of DNA origami vs fluorophores 5 and 8.
Fluorescence intensities of SLE sera
and controls (human anticardiolipin plasma, HCl, and human normal
plasma, HNP), upon incubation with 5, 8,
and their complexes with DNA origami prism A, calf thymus DNA (CTD),
and DNA origami box. The assay was carried out in 100 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2% BSA, using excitation/emission wavelengths
of 360/440 nm (5) or 380/470 nm (8). Each
measurement has been done in duplicates. P value
is given for the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of all
groups.

We carried out the direct immunofluorescence
detection using 1
nM prism A, with an excess of fluorophore (5 or 8 at 250 nM) and 2 μL human plasma in 10 μL incubation
buffer (1 g BSA, 200 μL Tween-20 in 1 L 1× PBS). The samples
were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h and then analyzed by fluorometry,
as shown in Figure 1a. Antibodies to phospholipid cardiolipin often cross-react with
dsDNA.27 Therefore, we included anticardiolipin
positive serum as a control along with healthy patient samples (HCl
and HNP, respectively). As can be seen in Figure 3, both fluorophores showed increased fluorescence
in the presence of origami and CTD. Fluorescence of the complex formed
by compound 8 and prism A decreased significantly when
adding SLE1 or SLE2 compared to that of the control sera (Supporting
Information, Figure S7). However, using
CTD as the DNA scaffold led to a positive response in HCl. Complexes
of compound 5 with all origami structures were generally
less sensitive to adding SLE sera than those of compound 8 (Figure 3).

To evaluate the role of the 3D dsDNA structure on the fluorophore
and a-dsDNA recognition, we repeated the experiments for the origami
staple strands in the absence of the scaffold strand, resulting in
no dsDNA origami formation (Supporting Information, Chapter 4). In this case, the fluorescence intensity by the dyes
was approximately threefold lower than that for the assembled DNA
origami structure. Dyes 5 and 8 were also
tested without DNA, in which case the sera had no effect on their
fluorescence properties (Supporting Information, Figure S7B).

We studied binding kinetics and stoichiometry
of prism A with fluorophores 5 and 8 by
fluorescence (Supporting Information, Figures S8,S9 and Table S4).28 According
to fluorescence titration studies, KD values
for 5 and 8 vs prism
A were 2 and 1.1 μM, respectively, which is in the similar range
as that for previously reported DNA binding dye Eva green.29 For antibody binding, KD values for 5 and 8 were approx.
50-fold lower than that for prism A, 40 and 26 nM, respectively (Supporting
Information, Table S4).

When the
complexes of 5 and 8 with prism
A were subjected to interaction with monoclonal anti-dsDNA antibody,10KD values were also
within the expected low nanomolar range, 1.25 and 0.24 nM for 5–prism A and 8–prism A, respectively
(Supporting Information, Table S4).30 For the negative control (monoclonal antibody
to β2-microglobulin10), no binding
was observed confirming the specificity of the DNA antigens toward
anti-dsDNA antibody (Supporting Information, Figure S10).

Binding stoichiometry was studied by binding isotherms
following
the described protocol.28 For 5 and 8, the binding ratio of prism A was estimated as
300 mole equivalent of a fluorophore, ±3%. In all of the experiments,
the results were consistent upon varying the host concentrations.28

The goal of our final study was to explore
the properties of compound 8–DNA prism A as a
diagnostic tool for antibody detection
in SLE. Compound 8 and prism A have been selected on
the basis of the high sensitivity to adding SLE sera and superior
quantum yield vs that of 5 (Supporting Information, Table S1). We used a cohort obtained from Odense
University Hospital, Denmark, containing 80 adult SLE and 60 healthy
control (HC) samples. We benchmarked the performance of compound 8–prism A to a commercial ELISA assay. For this study,
the patient samples were selected on the basis of the diagnosed SLE
and positivity to antinuclear antibodies determined by a clinical
lab. The median age of the SLE-positive patients was 44.7 years and
84% were females. For the experiments, patient sera were diluted 1:100
with standard ELISA diluent. To achieve the required sensitivity and
specificity, the molar ratio 8/prism A was optimized
for the assay and kept at 250:1 (Supporting Information, Figure S11A). Incubation with dye/dye–prism
complex was carried out at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Samples were analyzed
by fluorometry using excitation of 370 nm (8) or 480
nm (Eva green).

We analyzed the position of fluorescence maximum
and their intensities
for compound 8–DNA prism complex in the presence
of human sera (Figure 4; Supporting Information, Tables S6–S9). The mean wavelength for fluorescence maximum was 422 nm, which
is 8 nm shorter compared to the emission of the complex of compound 8–prism A in the absence of serum. Minimum and maximum
values for the emission shift upon incubation were 0 and −12
nm, respectively.

and ELISA.

intensity at maximum upon incubation of the complex 8–prism A with sera; (c) Change in absorbance values determined
by ELISA as a response to incubation with sera. The data is presented
for SLE and healthy controls (HC; number of patients: 80 (SLE) and
60 (HC)). The arms on each boxplot are values Q1 – 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR) and Q3 + 1.5 × IQR. Data points for each measurement
are mean values for two independent measurements with deviation of
the results <3%.

As for the intensity
at emission maximum, 250 nM of compound 8 in SLE sera
had intensity of 18 ± 2 arb. units (Supporting
Information, Figure S7A). Upon adding 1
nM prism A solution, the intensity increased to 69 ± 2 arb. units.
As in the preliminary assay, we observed quenching of fluorescence
upon incubation of the compound 8–prism A complex
with SLE sera; mean intensity for these samples were reduced to 43
± 21 arb. units with a rather big deviation among individual
samples (Supporting Information, Table S8). We observed a minimum intensity of 17 (quenching) and up to 100
for some samples. Testing healthy controls (HC) gave a cut-off value
for the positivity by this assay, which was the fluorescence intensity
change −8 units. In total, 32 SLE samples were found to be
positive by both wavelength shift and quenching of fluorescence intensity.
However, only 32% positive samples overlapped when the two types of
positivity were compared with each other. We carried out sandwich
ELISA for SLE samples (n = 80), as a control for
the assay. In this case, 46% were positive; only 45% of the positives
overlapped for the immunofluorescence assay and ELISA.

Having
tested healthy controls (n = 60), we observed
a somewhat similar performance of the fluorescence assay using the
prism A/8 complex and the commercial ELISA kit (Figure 4, data for HC cohort).
The total number of false positives by ELISA was 6 (10%) vs 4 (7%)
for our immunofluorescence assay.

To better understand the predictor
role of the a-dsDNA detected
by compound 8–prism A, we performed correlation
analyses of the obtained antibody levels with clinical features of
the patients. The analysis was done for the immunofluorescence and
ELISA. Double positivity by emission intensity and wavelength (n = 32) did correlate much stronger with arthritis than
the result provided by ELISA for these samples (one-way ANOVA test; p = 3.3 × 10–5 compared to 0.68,
respectively; Supporting Information Table S11 and Figure S12). We also observed a correlation of a-dsDNA
levels determined by the novel immunofluorescence assay with positivity
to anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies (p = 0.014).

Our result can be further rationalized in terms of polyclonal features
of the antibodies. It is common that only 40–70% of the SLE-positive
subjects develop high level of a-dsDNA.3,6 Therefore,
our results of ELISA lie within the expected range of positivity (46%).
It is also well documented that ELISA reveals the broad range of antibodies.
In turn, the compound 8–prism A complex in the
fluorescence assay might be more specific to the antibodies with high
affinity.10 Effective removal of the dye
molecules from the antigen, leading to an optical effect, requires
high affinity of the antibody to dsDNA which is confirmed by the low
dissociation constant of prism A–antibody complex in the presence
of 8 (KD 0.24 nM). This is
also in agreement with the stronger correlation of the a-dsDNA determined
by compound 8–prism A with clinical features vs
ELISA. It is also worth mentioning that ELISA for a-dsDNA is of IgG
type only, whereas immunofluorescence also detects other antibody
types (IgM, IgA). This could affect the results and correlations with
clinical features as well. Lastly, it is remarkable how the substitution
in the organic fluorophores allows for the fine tuning of its performance
in sensing an antibody. This makes us believe that merging organic
synthesis with emerging diagnostic needs could be a new paradigm for
assay development, which could positively affect the research and
clinical management of difficult conditions such as SLE.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, in this study, we prepared and
studied new fluorophores
for the detection of human antibodies in serum. In the homogeneous
immunofluorescence assay, novel DNA–fluorophore complexes show
the required features of specificity and sensitivity. This allowed
us to screen 80 patient samples diagnosed with an autoimmune disease,
SLE, and to define new clinical correlations for the determined antibody
levels.

Further development of simple and reliable diagnostic
methods for
human antibodies have a potential to open up for new possibilities
for using organic fluorophores as effective diagnostic tools. In particular,
we believe that this simple time- and cost-effective immunofluorescence
approach has much to offer to the rapidly developing field of antibody
analysis in biofluids.
