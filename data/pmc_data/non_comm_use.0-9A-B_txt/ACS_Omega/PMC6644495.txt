Perovskite-based
solar cells are promising because of their rapidly
improving efficiencies but suffer from instability issues. Recently,
it has been claimed that one of the key contributors to the instability
of perovskite solar cells is ion migration-induced electrode degradation,
which can be avoided by incorporating inorganic hole-blocking layers
(HBLs) in the device architecture. In this work, we investigate the
operational environmental stability of methylammonium lead iodide
perovskite solar cells that contain either an inorganic or organic
HBL, with only the former effectively blocking ions from migrating
to the metal electrode. This is confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
measured on the electrodes of degraded devices, where only electrodes
of devices with an organic HBL show a significant iodine signal. Despite
this, we show that when these devices are degraded under realistic
operational conditions (i.e., constant illumination in a variety of
atmospheric conditions), both types of devices exhibit nearly identical
degradation behavior. These results demonstrate that contrary to prior
suggestions, ion-induced electrode degradation is not the dominant
factor in perovskite environmental instability under operational conditions.

Introduction
The favorable electronic
and optical properties of hybrid lead
halide perovskites have enabled the remarkable performance increase
in solar cells based on such materials, which currently have reached
a maximum efficiency of 22.7%.1 Device
stability, however, remains a major factor impeding their commercialization,
where lifetimes of more than 25 years are required.2 Previous studies have investigated the degradation of device
performance because of environmental factors such as oxygen,3−5 moisture,6−9 and heat,10,11 and explanatory models have been
proposed for some scenarios.12,13 At the same time, device
degradation under inert (nitrogen atmosphere) operating conditions
is a widely observed but not conclusively explained phenomenon.14,15 In one popular model, it is claimed that device degradation originates
predominantly from metal electrode corrosion: mobile halide ions,
such as iodide, migrate through the active material and the adjacent
electron extraction layer toward the metal cathodes, such as silver.16−20 This could then give rise to the formation of insulating silver
iodine,21,22 which would inhibit the extraction of charges,
increase series resistance, and enable the formation of an undesirable
dipole interface layer.17,23 This hypothesis is
often accompanied by the claim that a buffer layer of a dense electron-transporting
material, such as ZnO, TiOx, or SnO2, could serve as an “ion-blocking layer” and
prohibit the migration of ions and thus improve the stability of perovskite
solar cells.24−27 Although such studies have demonstrated increased device shelf life
(dark storage) stability, few studies featuring full device degradation,
under constant illumination and both inert and non-inert atmospheres,
as well as employing rigorous compositional analysis to conclusively
prove either of these two claims have been presented to date.27

In this work, we compare the environmental
stability of methylammonium
lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells that contain
inorganic ZnO nanoparticle-based hole-blocking layers (HBLs) against
reference devices that employ the commonly used bathocuproine (BCP)
as the HBL. While both types of devices show a similar initial photovoltaic
(PV) performance, the inorganic HBL effectively blocks mobile iodide
ions from reaching and reacting with the metal electrode. This is
not the case for devices with an organic HBL, in which a significant
amount of iodine is detected by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (PES).
Characterizing the environmental stability of the two types of devices
under illumination allows us to probe the role of ion-induced electrode
degradation on the stability of the devices in various atmospheres.
We find that both types of devices show very similar degradation dynamics,
revealing that suppressing ion-induced electrode degradation does
not improve the operational stability of these cells.

Results and Discussion
To investigate the effect of ion-induced electrode degradation
on the operational stability of perovskite solar cells, we study the
degradation of complete cells using MAPbI3 in the inverted
indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/MAPbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PCBM)/HBL/Ag architecture, as displayed in Figure 1. We fabricate two
types of perovskite solar cells: one with the commonly used organic
BCP and another with ZnO nanoparticles as HBL, with all other layers
fabricated in an identical fashion. In order to provide the best possible
comparison of the degradation behavior between devices with the two
HBLs, our first step was to optimize the thickness of the ZnO layer to
achieve comparable initial PV performance of the two types of
devices with similar charge extraction efficiency and recombination.
ZnO nanoparticles were deposited via spin-coating at various spin
speeds, and the resulting device performance was measured under AM
1.5G solar illumination and is displayed in Figure 2. As the spin speed decreases
(and thus the ZnO layer becomes thicker), the device performance first
increases up to approximately 8 nm of ZnO thickness and then decreases
with further increases in ZnO thickness. At this thickness, both short-circuit
current density (JSC) and fill factor
(FF) are maximized, whereas the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is largely independent of HBL thickness. At this optimal
thickness, the ZnO devices possess comparable performance to the BCP
reference devices. Typical J–V curves for both device types are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).

(b) energy diagram, and (c) electron-transporting
layer/HBL materials used.

One sample with BCP as the HBL was fabricated in the same batch for
direct comparison. Error bars represent the standard deviation. An
optimal value of 8 nm was found for ZnO nanoparticle layer’s
thickness.

As mentioned before, previous
work has suggested that one of the
primary degradation mechanisms in perovskite-based devices is due
to migration of ions toward, and subsequent reaction with, the metal
electrodes. In the case of the devices in this study, this would be
the migration of iodide to the silver electrode, which could then
react with the silver to form the insulator AgI.16,19,28 To examine whether the ZnO HBL did effectively
block iodide migration, both ZnO and BCP devices were degraded in
an inert environment and under constant solar illumination for 14
h, and afterward, the Ag electrodes were removed via a tape and characterized
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This allowed us to look
for the presence of iodine in the electrodes. We note that because
XPS experiments are performed in ultrahigh vacuum, volatile iodine
cannot be detected, so only the species of bound iodide, such as in
metal iodides, would be detected. The I 3d signals for both the ZnO
and BCP device electrodes are displayed in Figure 3a. While the BCP devices show a clear and
strong I 3d signal, indicating that iodide has indeed reacted with
the electrode, the ZnO devices, in contrast, show no presence of iodine.
This confirms that on the timescale of the degradation experiment,
a ZnO HBL effectively blocks the migration of iodide ions into a metal
electrode, most likely due to the layer’s higher density when
compared to BCP. Figure 3b shows the excess iodine signal measured by XPS depth profiling,
of degraded devices, from which the electrodes were peeled off. Similar
to the results of Figure 3a, significant excess of iodine is detected in the PCBM extraction
layer of the BCP device, whereas there is a far smaller iodine excess
for the ZnO device. This result suggests that the inorganic HBL not
only blocks iodide from reaching the metal electrode but also prevents
Ag from penetrating into the PCBM layer during the thermal evaporation
of the electrode, which in turn could also react with I ions. This
mechanism has also been reported to be detrimental to the device performance.29 These results confirm that the incorporation
of an inorganic HBL can suppress ion migration-induced electrode degradation,
whereas the organic HBL allowed for this degradation to take place.

degraded devices, showing the I 3d (iodine) signal. (b) Excess iodine
in the Ag/HBL/PCBM layer, obtained by XPS conducted after etching
via argon beam. After approximately 60 s of etching, the interface
with the perovskite film is reached.

Figure 4 displays
the degradation behavior of the BCP devices under exposure to AM 1.5G
solar illumination in the three different atmospheres: N2, dry air, and humidified N2 [30% relative humidity (RH)]with
an additional period at 10–12 h where the cells were left to
rest in the dark to investigate possible performance recovery.14 We chose to compare three different degradation
environments to eliminate the possibility that the difference in degradation
dynamics would be associated with the different HBLs, rather than
the ion-induced electrode degradation. Devices were held in the open-circuit
condition while not being measured. During the 14 h measurement period,
we observe a moderate to severe decrease across all PV parameters,
with VOC being the least affected and JSC the strongest. For the inert and dry air
environments, VOC retains above 90% of
its initial value after 14 h. The devices exposed to water dipped
below 90% of VOC after approximately 3
h of measurement. JSC and FF plummet in
all cases, falling to ∼60 and 20% of their initial values for
N2/dry air and 30% RH, respectively, and are the primary
reasons for the steep loss in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Interestingly,
there appears to be little difference between the degradation behavior
in inert and dry air environments, with devices exposed to humidity
degrading markedly faster than both. Additionally, exposure to humidity
appears to affect the various pixels on each device differently, as
evidenced by the jagged trend lines and significantly wider error
margins.

Figure 4 Evolution of PV parameters (open-circuit voltage, short-circuit
current, efficiency, and FF) for devices with BCP as the HBL, degraded
in N2, dry air, and humidified N2 (30% RH) atmospheres
over 14 h. From 10 to 12 h, the devices were left in the dark, in
order to test the reversibility of the degradation. The shaded region
represents the standard deviation for the measurement.

The degradation behavior for the experimental devices
employing
ZnO as the HBL, under identical degradation conditions, is displayed
in Figure 5. Overall,
the results are very similar to the BCP devices, with a relatively
stable VOC and strongly degraded JSC and FF. Just like the reference devices,
the effects under N2 and dry air atmospheres are identical,
and exposure to water again degrades the devices both more quickly
and less uniformly. The overall amount of degradation is slightly
reduced for the ZnO devices, with the PCE falling to roughly 40% rather
than 30% of their initial values. This is, however, only a slight
improvement and could very easily be due to natural variation between
the devices.

Figure 5 Evolution of PV parameters (open-circuit voltage, short-circuit
current, efficiency, and FF) for devices with ZnO as the HBL, degraded
in N2, dry air, and humidified N2 (30% RH) atmospheres
over 14 h. From 10 to 12 h, the devices were left in the dark, in
order to test the reversibility of the degradation. The shaded region
represents the standard deviation for the measurement.

Combining the degradation behavior with the XPS
measurements of
the electrodes yields two main conclusions. First, degradation for
devices under constant illumination with the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/[BCP or ZnO]/Ag is not
driven by an oxygen-related mechanism, as devices in both inert and
dry air atmospheres displayed similar degradation characteristics.
Aristidou et al. proposed that oxygen-related perovskite decomposition
proceeds by the generation of photoexcited electrons within the perovskite
crystal.3 Because PCBM is known to extract
electrons from MAPbI3 on shorter timescales than chemical
reactions can occur,30 the presence of
PCBM at the perovskite interface possibly prevents oxygen-related
degradation by withdrawing photoexcited electrons rapidly after their
formation. The presence of moisture accelerates the degradation, regardless
of the HBL used. With several vulnerable components, the root cause
of the rapid decay in moisture is difficult to isolate. For example,
while water is known to have a significant impact on perovskite stability2,31−33 and also might facilitate the diffusion of volatile
products inside the perovskite,26,34 PCBM has also been
shown to undergo strong irreversible degradation in the presence of
water.35

The second overall conclusion
is that in contrast to the prevailing
view, ZnO HBLs do not significantly alter the degradation characteristics
when compared to the more common HBL BCP.21 XPS measurements of degraded device electrodes did confirm that
ZnO hinders the reaction of iodide ions with the electrode on the
timescale of the experiment; however, there was no meaningful difference
between the ZnO and BCP device performance deterioration. Han et al.36 found similar iodide infiltration into the silver
electrode through the hole-transport layer Spiro-OMeTAD in their devices,
accompanied with a dramatic loss in PCE. They suggested that replacement
of the silver contact with a more chemically inert electrode, such
as Cu or C, could improve the device stability by preventing this
modification. Our results suggest that this iodide infiltration, and
subsequent modification of the electrode into a more insulating species,
cannot be the dominant factor in the observed overall performance
loss. Lee et al. previously showed that the removal and re-evaporation
of the silver electrode in degraded devices did partially restore
the device performance;19 however, a significant
reduction in JSC remained. This suggests
that an additional irreversible degradation mechanism is present.

In a study related to our work, Back et al. demonstrated that a
layer of titanium suboxide (TiOx) placed
between the PCBM and the silver electrode could effectively increase
the device stability.27 Indeed, on similar
timescales (∼10 h) to our experiments, devices with a TiOx layer maintained ∼80% of their initial
PCE, compared to 50% with our ZnO HBL. This seemingly contradictory
result can be explained by two factors. First, their reference devices
contained no HBL on top of the PCBM. It is widely known that directly
evaporating metallic contacts onto organic films can damage and thereby
harm the film stability.37 Therefore, the
TiOx layer will increase the device stability
simply by protecting the PCBM during thermal evaporation. Second,
Back et al. held their devices at the maximum power point, which has
been shown to slow the degradation significantly when compared to
devices held at VOC.38 Once this difference is accounted for, the stability for
devices containing TiOx and ZnO nanoparticle
blocking layers is extremely similar. In another study using a similar
device structure, Akbulatov et al. demonstrated strongly enhanced
stability when replacing PCBM with a perylene diimide derivative in
encapsulated devices degraded in nitrogen under illumination. They
attributed the strong degradation to the accumulation of volatile
methylammonium iodide within the PCBM layer, subsequent reaction of
iodide with the silver electrode, and the resulting formation of PbI2 inside the perovskite layer.20

Taken all these results together, a plausible explanation
for the
observed deterioration of the device performance is obtained by considering
the effects of ion migration not on the electrode, but instead on
the perovskite active layer. While the ZnO layer prevents iodide infiltration
into the electrode, the diffusion of volatile components out of the
perovskite layer into PCBM should still be possible (and would remain
undetectable by XPS) and has been previously shown to initiate significant
degradation, for example, by way of passivating the perovskite at
the crystal grain boundaries.20,26,28,39 Passivation at the boundaries
in turn isolates each individual grain, leading to difficulties in
conduction and charge extraction. This conclusion is supported by
the specific mechanism of degradation observed in our study, with
the primary drivers of PCE deterioration being a loss of JSC and FF, the two parameters associated with conductivity
and charge extraction efficiency. Additionally, recently, Zhao et
al. showed that the ion-induced degradation of charge extraction layers
can also be a major cause for device instabilities.40 Our results indicate that even without the iodide migration-induced
degradation of the electrode, the above-mentioned degradation pathways
can still take place and strongly affect the device stability.

Conclusions
To summarize, we investigated the role of ion-induced electrode
degradation in inverted perovskite PV devices under realistic operational
conditions. We find that, contrary to what was previously suggested,
suppressing degradation by blocking ion migration to the electrode
does not necessarily improve the device stability significantly under
operational conditions. Although it has been shown that this degradation
mechanism plays a significant role in determining the long-term dark
storage stability of devices, its significance is diminished once
more prominent degradation processes are present under full illumination.
We propose that it is not ion-migration induced electrode corrosion,
but rather the diffusion of volatile products out of the perovskite
active layer and into the PCBM layer, that causes strong and irreversible
degradation under operational conditions. Further research is required
to elucidate the exact role that ion migration plays in affecting
the device performance and stability; however, this work shows that
the scope of such research must encompass a thorough examination,
under realistic operating conditions, of both the perovskite active
layer and the other device components.

Experimental Methods
Device
Fabrication
If not stated otherwise, all materials
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. To fabricate devices, prepatterned
indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (Psiotech Ltd., 15
Ω sq–1) were first cleaned sequentially with
acetone and 2-propanol, followed by 10 min oxygen plasma treatment.
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios Al 4083, Heraeus) was spin-coated onto the clean
ITO substrates and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air.
For the perovskite layer fabricated by the lead acetate trihydrate
recipe, CH3NH3I (GreatCell Solar) and Pb(Ac)2·3(H2O) (3:1, molar ratio) were dissolved
in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) with a concentration of 40 wt % with the addition of hypophosphorous
acid solution (6 μL mL–1 DMF). The perovskite
solution was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s in a dry box (RH <
0.5%). After drying for 5 min, the samples were annealed at 100 °C
for 5 min. Subsequently, the samples were transferred to a N2-filled glovebox. PCBM (Solenne BV) in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL–1) was dynamically spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 45 s
and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. BCP was fully dissolved in
2-propanol (0.5 mg mL–1) and dynamically spin-coated
at 4000 rpm for 30 s. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized following
an adapted procedure of Pacholski, which is briefly described in Supporting Note 1.41 The resulting nanoparticles were further characterized by UV–visible
absorbance and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figures S2
and S3, Supporting Information). TEM characterization
was carried out by JEOL 2010 TEM (200 kV) equipped with a Gatan camera.
Single or multiple layers of ZnO were cast from colloidal solution
to obtain layers of different thicknesses. To complete the device,
80 nm silver electrodes were deposited via thermal evaporation under
high vacuum.

Device Characterization and Degradation
To properly
assess the degradation of the perovskite solar cells, each device
was identically prepared, stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox, and
transferred to a sealed environmental box without exposure to ambient
air. A constant flow of either nitrogen, nitrogen and oxygen (80:20,
v/v), or humidified nitrogen (30% RH) was connected to an environmental
box. The oxygen percentage was controlled by adjusting the relative
flow rate of O2 to N2 and monitored by a zirconia
sensor (Cambridge Sensotet, Rapidox 2100) continuously before being
connected to the environmental box. All of the devices were operated
under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight at 100 mW cm–2 irradiance
(Abet Sun 3000 Class AAA solar simulator) for 10 h (in open-circuit
condition) and then “rested” in the dark for 2 h before
another 2 h measurement period, bringing the total experiment time
to 14 h. This rest period was performed in response to Nie et al.,
who demonstrated that short rest periods could “heal”
degraded devices.14 The J–V measurements were performed with a Keithley
2450 source measure unit. The cells were scanned from forward bias
to short circuit and back at a rate of 0.5 V s–1 after being held under illumination at 1.2 V for 2 s. The light
intensity was calibrated with a Si reference cell (NIST traceable,
VLSI) and corrected by measuring the spectral mismatch between the
solar spectrum, the spectral response of the perovskite solar cell,
and the reference cell. The mismatch factor was calculated to be approximately
11%.

X-ray PES and Depth Profiling
The perovskite devices
investigated by PES measurements were fabricated and degraded as described
above. The Ag electrodes were peeled off and transferred into an ultrahigh
vacuum chamber of the PES system (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi)
for XPS measurements. XPS measurements were performed using an XR6
monochromated Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6
eV) and a pass energy of 20 eV. Depth profiles were performed on the
remaining layers of the devices using a Magsic Ar etching source.
