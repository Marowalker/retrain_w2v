The electron-transport
layer in planar perovskite solar cells plays
an important role in improving photoelectric conversion efficiency.
At present, the main electronic transmission materials in perovskite
solar cells include TiO2, ZnO, WO3, ZrO2, SnO2, ZnO2, etc. This work mainly
studies the electron-transport characteristics of six different electron-transport
layers in perovskite solar cells. Based on the density functional
theory, the electron-transport model of a solar cell doped with formamidinium
iodide lead compound perovskite under six different electron-transport
materials was constructed, and their effective electron mass and the
mobility of carriers were obtained by optimizing the structure and
theoretical calculation. The results show that the mobility of electrons
in TiO2 crystal is slightly higher than that of FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 carriers. Because of their high matching degree, it can be
reasonably explained that titanium dioxide has been widely used in
perovskite solar cells and achieved higher photoelectric conversion
efficiency. In addition, the mobility of carriers in WO3 and SnO2 crystals is also high, so they also have great
advantages in carrier transport. Due to its abundant, nontoxic, and
low-pollution content, TiO2 has become the most widely
used electronic transmission layer material for solar cells. Furthermore,
we have explored eight new semiconductor materials that have not yet
been used in perovskite solar cells as the electron-transport layer.
The calculation results show that Ta2O5 and
Bi2O3 are promising materials for the electron-transport
layer. This study provides a theoretical basis for seeking better
electronic transmission materials for solar cells in the future.

1 Introduction
In the past 10 years, sensitized solar cells that use perovskite
doped with formamidine iodide lead as an optical absorption layer
have become a hot spot in the field of solar cells due to their low
cost and high conversion efficiency.1−6 Lately, Newport has been authorized by the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory of the United States to update the certification of perovskite
solar cells with a maximum efficiency of 23.7%.7 The mechanism of electron–hole pairs excitation
after absorbing photons in perovskite solar cells has been reported
in many references.8−10 Theoretically, the main ways to improve the efficiency
of dye-sensitized solar cells are as follows: (1) increase the absorption
of light by sensitizer, (2) improve the transport efficiency of electron
and hole, and (3) reduce the recombination of charge. One of them
is to improve the electron-transfer efficiency of electronic transmission
materials and the electron-transport layer plays an important role
in n–i–p perovskite solar cells. However, different
electronic transmission materials have different transmission efficiencies.
Jun Hong Noh and colleagues reported that perovskite solar cells using
TiO2 thin film mesoporous structure as the electron-transport
material can achieve an efficiency of 12.3% under standard solar light.11 Kim and his co-workers reported the photovoltaic
characteristics of perovskite solar cells with nanostructure ZrO2 as the electron-transport material.12 A method of gradually injecting electrons into ZnO via exciplex
intermediates at the surface was reported in ref (13). So far, the main materials
used for electronic transmission are TiO2, ZnO, WO3, ZrO2, SnO2, ZnO2, and so
on. Among these electron-transport layer materials, TiO2 is one of the ideal materials in the structure of perovskite solar
cells. Waleed Abu Laban et al. analyzed the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction by means of the Mott–Schottky
method and expounded the operation mechanism of CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 in a solar cell.14

To find a kind of electron-transfer material
that matches the carrier
rate of the photosensitive absorber for improving the photoelectric
conversion efficiency (PCE), many researchers have focused on the
properties of nanoporous TiO2 films immersed in electrolytes15−25 due to their unique role in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
Others have tried to use different electron-transport materials to
match the band structure of the doped organic–inorganic perovskite
materials (CH3NH3PbI3) and ((NH2CH=NH2)PbI3) to increase the
carrier transport rate.26−32 Giles E. Eperon et al. obtained 20.3% efficiency of four-terminal
series batteries by mechanically stacking with FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 material.33 At present, there is no theoretical analysis
of the electron-transport characteristics of the perovskite FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3, nor is there a density functional theory (DFT) used to analyze
the effective electron mass and carrier transfer efficiency of FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 and six kinds of commonly used electron-transfer materials.
In this paper, we theoretically model, optimize, and study the effective
mass and carrier mobility of six kinds of electron-transport layer
materials, which is helpful in exploring new electronic transport
materials in the future.

2 Structural Model
The structure of perovskite solar cells is shown in Figure 1. They usually consist of back
electrode, hole-transport layer (HTM), perovskite absorption layer,
electron-transport layer (such as titanium dioxide), TiO2 dense layer, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) cathode layer, and
glass substrate. When the absorption layer of perovskite absorbs sunlight,
free electron-hole pairs are produced. The free electrons diffuse
to the perovskite/titanium dioxide interface and are injected into
the conduction band of TiO2, propagating in the TiO2 layer and reaching the back electrode, and then flowing through
the external circuit to the metal electrode. When free electrons are
excited into the perovskite conduction band, holes are generated in
the perovskite valence band and diffused into the perovskite/hole-transport
layer interface and then injected into the HTM valence band. Holes
travel in the hole-transport layer and reach the metal.

Figure 1 Structure of
perovskite solar cell electrode, where they bind to
free electrons to complete the loop. Next, we focus on the electron-transport
layer and carrier transport properties of planar perovskite solar
cells. Also, the structure and electron density of bulk (FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3) and
TiO2 are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 shows the bonding and charge distribution of FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 and
TiO2. The gray and blue portions of the figure
are the probability distributions of electrons on both sides of the
equilibrium position. According to quantum mechanics theory, the position
of electrons is random and therefore cannot accurately describe the
position of electrons. Therefore, statistical methods can only be
used to predict the probability of occurrence at a certain location,
so the gray and blue portions represent the probability. Different
colors represent different orbits, and the same color represents the
same orbit, which can also be said to be the probability of electrons
appearing. Gray/blue indicates how the two orbits overlap, showing
different colors to distinguish, and the density of the electron cloud.
Gray and blue are the probabilities of the emergence of electronic
clouds, many of which are electronic clouds that are generally considered
to be more active. According to Figure 2a, the electron density around FA and Cs is relatively
small, and the charge density is quite different from that of adjacent
atoms. The electron density distributions of lead ions and iodide
ions are not much different, and the bonding types between atoms are
mainly covalent bonds or metal bonds. It can be seen that the distribution
of electronic states is related to the atomic gap and structure from
the structure of TiO2 shown in Figure 2b. The unbonded part is the boundary with
a lower electron density. The difference of electron density between
oxygen and titanium bond regions is large, and the bonding type is
ionic bond.

The lattice matching parameters
in Figure 3 of the
two crystal interfaces are as follows:

All the mismatch
ratio of lattices interface are less than 4%, except that of FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3@ZnO, which is about 8%.

3 Computational Methods
The structure of the doped formamidinium lead iodide perovskite
oxide (FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3) and TiO2 was constructed by Material Studio
software. The electron density of states, energy band structure, and
optical properties are calculated by Dmol3 package. Also,
the details of the calculations were as follows: the exchange-correlation
effects were treated by Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) version
of Perdew-Wang-1991(PW91),34 and the basis
set was 4.4 double Numerical plus d-functions basis (DND), the qualities
were selected as “fine”, SCF tolerance is at 10–4 eV/atom, the other sets were the default.

All
planar heterostructures of FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3/(TiO2, ZnO,
WO3, ZrO2, SnO2, ZnO2)
and eight new semiconductor crystals were constructed by Visualizer
module in Material Studio software,35 as
shown in Figure 3.
The band gaps of TiO2/ZnO/WO3/ZrO2/SnO2/ZnO2 and eight new semiconductor crystals
were calculated using CASTEP module.36−38 The exchange-correlation
effects were still treated by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
function in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).35 The cutoff energy of plane wave basis set is
340 eV, and the parameters of convergence tolerance are as follows:
energy 10–5 eV/atom and maximum force 0.01 eV/Å.
The calculation and optimization structure in this paper are based
on the principle of lowest energy. Also, the quantum effects are taken
into account in both CASTEP and DMOL3 computational modules.
Moreover, the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) is an empirical
describing function, which attributes the electron–electron
interaction to exchange-correlation energy (EXC). The main parameters
calculated in this paper are band gaps and elastic modulus, which
do not involve additional magnetic field.

4 Results
and Discussion
4.1 Calculation Results of
Six Crystals
The effective mass of electrons directly affects
the efficiency of
electron transport in the electron-transport layer, which, in turn,
affects the conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. The effective
mass of electrons depends on the K state and band structure of electrons.
According to the theory of solid physics, if the band width is wider,
the effective mass is smaller. The band gaps of the above six crystal
structures were calculated by first principles and is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Band structure of six
crystals.

According to the theory of solid-state
physics. The holes appear
at the top of the valence band. The electrons appear at the bottom
of the conduction band. The effective masses of electrons and holes
can be determined from the curvature of the dispersion curve at the
extreme value. Since the effective mass is inversely proportional
to the second derivative of energy, the smaller the extreme value
of the curve, the heavier the electron or hole. The effective mass
of carriers indicates the mobility of carriers under the action of
external electric fields. If the effective mass is light, it shows
that the carrier mobility is very high, and the corresponding material
conductivity will be large. The effective mass of electrons is relative
to the mass of free electrons. It contains the physical effects of
all interactions between electrons and the surrounding environment.
The electron (or hole) of crystal can be considered as a particle
(as quantum wave packet) with momentum P = ℏk (k is the quasi-momentum of crystal
electrons or holes) and energy. That is, the electrons or holes in crystals
are free particles with effective masses, and their effective masses
are, respectively, me* and mh*. According to the solid physics,
we can estimate the effective mass (m*) of carriers
near the bottom of the conductive band or the top of the valence band
by fitting the dispersion relation.37 1  

Here ε(k) is the band
edge eigenvalue and k is the wave-vector.
The unit of  is . The value of effective mass depends on
the second derivative near the bottom of the conduction band and the
top of the valence band from formula 2. Therefore,
the function ε(k) = A + Bk + Ck2 was fitted using the
parameters near the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the
valence band.39 Because of , the effective
mass can be obtained through
below formula 2  The effective
mass electrons and holes can
be calculated by adding the corresponding parameters, as shown in Tables 1 and 2.

If the effective mass is very small, the carrier mobility
is very
high and the corresponding material conductance is relatively large.
The effective mass of electrons depends on the band structure and
the electrons in the K states. From Tables 1–3, it can
be seen that the transmission efficiency of most crystals along the z-axis is higher than that along the x-axis
and y-axis except for ZnO2 and ZrO2 with a large electronic effective mass. Therefore, we have
constructed the plane heterojunction structure of perovskite FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 and electron-transport layer (TiO2, ZnO, WO3, ZrO2, SnO2, and ZnO2) according
to the lattice parameters shown in Figure 3.

In
semiconductor materials, the coherent wavelength of thermally
activated electrons or holes is much longer than the lattice constant
at room temperature and is close to that of phonon. The electron–phonon
coupling can lead to scattering in the low-energy region,38,39 which can be optimized by the deformation potential (DP) theory
proposed by Bardeen and Shockley.45 Through
the effective mass approximation, the DP theory has been widely used
to study the carrier mobility in two-dimensional materials. 3  where me* is the effective mass along the
transmission direction, md is the average
effective electron mass along the other two directions perpendicular
to the transmission direction  (where α, β
are x, y, or z)
and T is the temperature. E1i = ΔEg/(Δl/l) is the
deformation potential constant and ΔEg is the displacement of the band edges (the bottom of the electron
conduction band and the top of the hole valence band) caused by strain.
The elastic modulus along the z-axis and the uniform
deformation along the y-axis are calculated to simulate
the lattice distortion induced by strain activation. For the 2D model,
the in-plane stiffness can determined as C2D = [∂2ω/∂δ2]/S0, here ω is the total energy of the supercell,
δ is the applied uniaxial strain, and S0 is the area of the equilibrium supercell. The elastic modulus
follows the z-axis of the Forcite Code. In the y–z plane, the lattice constants
of the crystals FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3, TiO2, ZnO, WO3, ZrO2, SnO2, and ZnO2 along the
transmission direction, i.e., z-axis, are 12.8, 3.77,
4.63, 5.42, 5.29, 4.73, and 4.96 Å, respectively. Using formula 3, we obtain the carrier mobility of the above crystals,
as shown in Tables 4 and 5.

The carrier mobility
can be estimated by means of another way according
to the refs (46, 47), which reads 4  where ρ is the mass density and Sl is the sound velocity. The other parameters
in eq 4 are same as those
in formula 3. Using formula 4, we have calculated the carrier mobility such as in Tables 6 and 7.

Using formulas 3 and 4, we have calculated
the mobility of carriers and obtained the carrier
mobility of the seven crystals along the x-axis and z-axis, respectively, as shown in Tables 3–6. The results
obtained by the two methods are basically consistent. The calculated
results of ZnO carrier mobility are in good agreement with refs (48, 49). It was also reported that the mobility
of mesoporous TiO2 structure was 10–5 cm2/(V s) in the above references. It is well-known that
the mobility of carriers is an important characteristic parameter
of semiconductor materials. Theoretically, the carrier mobility of
inorganic semiconductors is 102–106 cm2/(V s). Because the carrier mobility of titanium dioxide in
a two-dimensional space is much higher than that of the mesoporous
structure, the above calculation results are relatively reliable (Figure 5).

4.2 Exploration of New Transport Materials
There are many other new semiconductor materials, such as Ta2O5, Bi2O3, Nb2O5, Pr2O3, Sb2O3, V2O5, In2S3, ZnS2, and so on, which have not yet been used in perovskite solar
cells as the electron-transport layer. They have attracted much attention
because of their good physical or chemical properties. Ta2O5 has a strong corrosion resistance and ductility, Bi2O3, Nb2O5, and V2O5 have better heat resistance, and In2S3 is a new type of two-dimensional material with wide spectral
response and photoelectric detection performance. Most of these materials
have good stability and are widely used in electronic devices or high-temperature
superconducting materials. There are a lot of literatures exploring
their relevant characteristics.50−55 In this section, we explore the band gap structure, optical absorption
properties, and electron mobility along the x-axis
and y-axis of eight crystals. The crystal structure
is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Planar heterostructures of FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3/(Ta2O5, Bi2O3, Nb2O5, Pr2O3, Sb2O3, V2O5, In2S3, and ZnS2). The lattice
matching parameters in (A) of the two crystal interfaces are abbreviated
as: 1 × 2 × 3/2 × 5 × 3, which means: FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 (a × 1; b × 2; c × 3) @ Ta2O5 (a ×
2; b × 5; c × 3), the
following three items are the crystal type, crystal name, and crystal
face information in turn. Also, those of other supbparts are the same
as those for (A). The heterojunction we constructed the layer-structure
as a crystal and kept constant volume with the vacuum as 0.

The band gaps of the above eight crystals were
calculated by first
principles and are shown in Figure 7. The carrier mobility can be estimated according to
the band gap structure. If the curve at the top of the valence band
(VB) is relatively flat, it indicates that the effective mass of electrons
is relatively large, and vice versa even from the top-of-the-price
curve in Figure 7.
The curves of V2O5 and In2S3 at the top of the valence band (VB) is relatively flat, but the
curves of Ta2O5 and Bi2O3 fluctuate considerably. Furthermore, we calculate the band gap by
considering the quantum effect and spin–orbit coupling (SOC)
with the CASTEP package of Material Studio 2017. The precision parameter
settings remain unchanged with the Dmol3, and the results
are shown in Tables 3 and 8. Comparing the results of the two methods
with those of the refs (40−44) and (56−63), we find that the band width will change to narrower. However, it
cannot calculate the other properties of crystal when considering
SOC. Comparing the results of the above references, we find that the
results obtained by DMOL3 package are reliable; in this
part, we use the results of the DFT energy gap to study the electron-transport
characteristics of the electron-transport layers in perovskite solar
cells.

5 Conclusions
The
speed of carrier transmission in the electron-transport layer
plays an important role in improving the power conversion efficiency
of solar cells. It is well-known that the dye molecule absorbs the
incident light, and the ground-state electron changes to the excited
state when the solar light is irradiated to the organic–inorganic
lead iodide perovskite. The unstable excited dye molecules rapidly
inject electrons into the TiO2 conduction band. The free
electrons propagate in the electron-transport layer and reach the
back electrode and then flow through the external circuit to the metal
electrode. The high mobility of electrons in the transport layer can
realize charge separation and reduce the charge recombination as soon
as possible, which is helpful to improve the photoelectric conversion
efficiency of solar cells. At present, the commonly used electronic
transmission materials are TiO2, ZnO, WO3, SnO2, ZrO2, ZnO2, and so on. Based on the
structure of the electron-transport layer of perovskite solar cells,
the electron-transport characteristics of six different materials
have been studied in this paper. First, the crystal structures of
perovskite and titanium dioxides were constructed by Studio software,
and the density distribution of electronic states in the crystal was
investigated by first principle. Then, the energy band structures
of six kinds of crystals are calculated, and according to the distribution
of the energy-level curves at the top of the valence band and the
bottom of the conduction band, the effective mass of the six kinds
of holes and electrons are obtained. It is found that the effective
mass of the electrons along the y-axis and x-axis is similar. In most of the above crystals, the transmission
speed of electrons along the z-axis is slightly higher
than that along the x-direction. On this basis, FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3/(TiO2, ZnO, WO3, ZrO2, SnO2, ZnO2) plane heterostructures along the z-axis are constructed and their electron mobility along
the z-axis and x-axis are calculated.
The mobility of the carriers along the z-axis and
the x-axis of the six electron-transport materials
are shown in Tables 4–7, respectively. From the above parameters,
we found that the mobility of electrons in TiO2 is slightly
higher than the carrier mobility of FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3. This can reasonably
explain the reason why TiO2 is widely used in perovskite
solar cells and which can perovskite solar cells to achieve the high
power conversion efficiency. In addition, from the data in Tables 4–7, the mobility of carriers in WO3 and
SnO2 crystals are also high. Therefore, they also have
advantages in carrier transport. Due to its abundance, nontoxicity,
and low pollution content, TiO2 has become the most widely
used electronic transmission layer material for solar cells (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Band structure of part
crystals after considering SOC.

Furthermore, we have explored eight new semiconductor materials
that have not yet been used in perovskite solar cells as the electron-transport
layer. Using the above method of calculating the carrier mobility,
the data in Table 8 are substituted into formula 4. We can calculate
the carrier mobility of these eight crystals, which is show in Table 7. The order of the
electron mobility along the x-direction from large to small is Ta2O5 > Nb2O5 > Bi2O3 > Sb2O3 > Nb2O5 > ZnS2 > In2S3 > V2O5, and that along y is Ta2O5 > Bi2O3 >
Sb2O3 > Nb2O5 >
Pr2O3 > In2S3 >
ZnS2 > V2O5, which can be shown
as Figure 9. Ta2O5 and Bi2O3 have good heat
resistance and a relatively good electron-transfer
rate. They are mostly used in electronic ceramics, electrolyte materials,
photoelectric materials, high-temperature superconducting materials,
catalysts, and so on.

Figure 9 Carrier mobility of eight crystals.

Comparing the calculation results in Tables 3 and 8, it is found
that the band gaps of ZnO, WO3, SnO2, ZnS2, and ZnO2 change obviously when considering the
spin and orbit coupling (SOC). We further analyze the energy band
structure in Figure 8. When considering the spin and orbit coupling, the band gap moves
to the other energy value or the band width changes. The band gap
of the ZnO, ZnS2 becomes three band gaps. Also, the band
structure of WO3 moves to the energy value from −7.44
and −20.23 eV and the SnO2 moves between −8.93
and −17.94 eV. The band gaps are 12.78 and 8.99 eV, respectively.
The band gap of ZnO2 is similar to the band gap structure
of ZnO and ZnS2. It can be shown that the main contribution
to the band gap structure when considering the SOC is a heavy element.
Then, we calculate the optical absorption properties of these crystals.
The absorption spectra are shown in Figure 10. The absorption of light is mostly concentrated
in the range of 100–500 nm. The absorption spectra range of
Nb2O5 and V2O5 is distributed
in 300–800 nm. However, carrier mobility of V2O5 is relatively low. Although the electron-transport materials
are not the main optical absorption layer, it still contributes to
the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Considering the factors of
electron-transmission characteristics and spectral absorption, Ta2O5 and Bi2O3 are promising
materials for the electron-transport layer. Considering the factors
of electron-transmission characteristics and spectral absorption,
Ta2O5 and Bi2O3 are promising
materials for the electron-transport layer. This study provides a
theoretical basis for finding better electronic transmission materials
for solar cells in the future.
