Tensile deformation behavior of three
random propylene–ethylene
copolymers with the same molecular weight and different contents of
counit was investigated at different temperatures from room temperature
to close to melting point via tensile tests, step-cycle tests, and
in situ wide-angle X-ray diffraction techniques. Upon stretching,
the original crystalline lamellae must be destroyed, generating new
highly oriented ones. A critical stress has been suggested, under
which the original crystallites can be destructed. The propylene–ethylene
copolymer samples in pure γ-form transformed gradually into
α-form during tensile stretching. This crystalline transition
proceeded via a destruction (melting) of the original γ-form
crystals followed by recrystallization of the freed polymeric chain
segments into α-form along stretching direction. This result
provides a marker for investigating the critical stress mentioned
above. Such critical stresses triggering the destruction of γ-form
crystals for the propylene–ethylene copolymers of different
ethylene counit contents were successfully calculated. It turned out
that this critical stress depended on the ethylene counit content
and stretching temperature. Samples with less ethylene counits show
higher critical stress because of a lower degree of insertion of the
ethylene counits into the crystalline unit cell than samples with
higher ethylene counit content. The critical stresses remained constant
when the samples were stretched at low-temperature region, whereas
they decreased significantly at high stretching temperatures close
to the melting points due to strong thermal distortion of the crystalline
lattices, making the crystallites less stable.

Introduction
Semicrystalline polymers
are normally composed of layerlike crystalline
phase and entangled amorphous chains in between.1 Understanding of the microstructural evolution of semicrystalline
polymers during tensile stretching is of both scientific and industrial
relevance. Upon investigating the macroscopic recovery properties
in several typical semicrystalline polymers, it was concluded that
a semicrystalline polymer can be regarded as interpenetrated networks
of hard crystalline skeleton and amorphous entangled soft network.2−5 Through a so-called “step-cycle” test, a separation
of the total strain into elastic part and plastic one can be achieved.6 Surprisingly, the recovery properties of semicrystalline
polymers change in a characteristic way at four critical strains (A–D),
reflecting microstructural evolution in the systems. Macroscopically,
the systems show onset of plastic strain at A, a sudden increase in
plastic strain at B, a plateau for elastic strain at C, and finally
a decrease in elasticity at D. According to above-mentioned interpenetrated
network model, these characteristic critical strains can be understood
as a result of isolated intralamellar crystalline block slips (A),
a change into a collective block slips (B), crystalline block disaggregation
(melting)–recrystallization-induced fibrillation (C), and disentanglements
(D), which is also confirmed by true stress–strain relationship
investigations and in situ wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements.6−12 Specially, the position of critical strain C is determined by the
interplay between the stability of crystalline blocks and the state
of amorphous entangled network.2 Only if
the stretched amorphous entangled network reaches certain strain can
it generate a critical stress, leading to a destruction of the crystalline
blocks followed by recrystallization with polymeric chains aligned
along the stretching direction forming crystalline fibrils. This two-phase
model explains the mechanical response of semicrystalline polymers
with sufficient crystallinity. A change of the position of critical
strain at C toward larger value was discovered in a low-crystallinity
ethylene/octane copolymer13 that led to
a more general three-phase model, taking into account the heterogeneity
of the distribution of the crystalline phase. In such system, disaggregation
(melting)–recrystallization process of crystalline blocks was
delayed due to the heterogeneous strain distribution in the system.
In addition, an elasticity reinforcement in large-deformation regime
at elevated stretching temperature for propylene–ethylene copolymer5 in step-cycle test also occurred due to slippage
of fibrils after depletion of unoriented crystals.

Isotactic
polypropylene (iPP) is a widely used commercial polymer
with various polymorphs, including monoclinic (α), trigonal
(β), orthorhombic (γ), and one smectic mesophase.14−21 The mechanical behavior of iPP is closely related to that of crystalline
polymorphs obtained under specific conditions. However, γ-form
can only be generated under some tough conditions, such as crystallization
at high pressure22 for iPP, leading to
the lack of investigation on the deformation mechanism. In fact, iPP
samples containing γ-form with the unique nonparallel structure
can prevent chain slips within crystals under stress except for the
(001) transverse slips.23,24 Besides, γ-form
prepared under high pressure reveals an enhanced strength and a strongly
reduced evolution of the dislocation density compared to the α-form.25 For propylene–ethylene random copolymers,
crystallization of γ-form can proceed at high temperature under
atmospheric pressure because the stereo and regio defects in the chain
made forming a low-energy ordered structure by chain tilting in copolymer26 at an advantage. De Rosa et al. demonstrated
that the amount of γ-form in polypropylene was determined by
the concentration27 and distribution28 of defects. γ-Form tends to develop in
the sample with random distribution of defects. They have also investigated29 the influence of chain microstructure on the
crystallization of polypropylene. The crystallization kinetics increased
with increasing the concentration or rr defects and decreasing the
molecular weight. Finally, they concluded that the amount of γ-form
increased with increasing crystallization temperature, comonomer concentration,
and content of rr stereodefects. The influence of catalyst and stereoirregularities
on the formation of γ-form has also been studied in previous
research,30−33 and all of them concluded that γ-form was promoted at high
temperature and systems with more defects.

The transition from
γ-form to α-form under tensile
deformation has also been investigated in recent years.34−40 Auriemma et al.41 proved the existence
of a continuum of disordered modifications in oriented γ-form
and calculated the fraction of bilayers similar to γ-form or
α-form at different stretched ratios. The structural disorder
originated from the random succession of bilayers of chains. Some
of the bilayers of chains were arranged like γ-form, whereas
others like α-form. So, the network was composed of continuum
of structural disorder. De Rosa et al.40,42 investigated
the relationship between the elastic properties and concentration
of rr defects. At the same time, they found43 that γ-form can transform into mesophase at very high deformation
and the mesomorphic phase can transform back to α-form upon
releasing the tension only for some elastic samples due to the enthalpic
contribution. The orientation mode of γ-form with unique structure
during stretching was first named “cross-β” by
Auriemma et al.44 because the perpendicular
orientation of chain axis with respect to the stretching direction
was very similar to the configuration of stretched silks.45 Actually, the cross-β orientation was
first proposed in this system where part of the chains of silk protein
orientated perpendicular to the stretching direction. In 2006 and
2007, De Rosa et al. described structural-mechanical phase diagram36 for isotactic polypropylene and demonstrated
that39 the mechanical behavior, including
the elastic modulus, ductility, toughness, and strength, can be tuned
by changing the concentration of rr stereodefects and ethylene counits.
Recently, they have investigated35 the
influence of temperature on the deformation of disordered γ-form
and proposed that γ-form transformed into mesophase at room
temperature and into α-form at 60 °C, which was due to
the increase of mobility of chains in amorphous matrix at a high temperature.
In 2006, Hsiao et al.46 investigated the
elastic behavior of propylene–ethylene copolymer, which was
composed of α-form. In addition, Mao et al.47 analyzed the transition behavior of γ-form during
stretching. The c axis always had a tilt angle with
respect to the fiber axis in the cross-β configuration. They
also found48 that larger lamellar crystals
in α-form were generated at higher stretching temperature, whereas
stretch-induced mesophase composed of tiny β-form was obtained
under larger stress at lower stretching temperature. They investigated38 the partial melting and recrystallization behavior
of uniaxial stretched γ-form of propylene–butene copolymer
and found that the survived crystals could serve as seed. Besides
the above work, Boger et al.49,50 also studied the phase
transition behavior and orientation of elastic polypropylenes.

Despite that a large body of literature reports on the transition
of γ-form to α-form in tensile stretched propylene–ethylene
random copolymers have been published, the actual micromechanical
mechanism of such transition remains not being fully revealed. Of
particular interest is the exact quantification of the critical stress
for the destruction of the original γ-form crystals during stretching.
The purpose of this work is thus to investigate the deformation behavior
of pure γ-form in random propylene–ethylene copolymers
with different contents of counits with special attention on quantifying
the critical stress for the destruction of γ-form crystallites.
The fibrillation point (critical point C) shown in step-cycle tests
was in correspondence with the transition point of γ-form to
α-form verified by WAXD measurements. The critical stress for
the onset of the destruction of γ-form crystallites was calculated.
It turns out that the transition point and critical stress of destructing
the original γ-form during stretching depend on the content
of counits and stretching temperature.

Results and Discussion
The polymorph of random propylene–ethylene copolymer during
isothermal crystallization depends strongly on the crystallization
temperature and stereodefects in the samples.27−29,39,51 The relationship between
the fraction of γ-form (fγ) and isothermal crystallization temperature is illustrated in Figure S2 in Supporting Information. The formation
of γ-form favors high crystallization temperature and high concentration
of counits. Figure S2 shows that fγ increased with crystallization temperature
and reached maximum (100%) at the highest temperature. At low temperature,
the crystallization of α-form is kinetically favored, leading
to a large amount of α-form. At high crystallization temperature,
chain folding26 of very long sequence-attached
noncrystallizable units with rich defects is very difficult. Chain
tilting in producing γ-form is an effective way to form a low-energy
three-dimensional ordered structure as the critical nucleus sequences
increase with temperature. The “defects”31,52,53 include the concentration of
counits and [rr] stereodefects, which shorten the average length of
the crystallizable sequences and the kinds of counit that lead to
different inclusions in the crystal. In this system, the content of
γ-form was the highest for iPPcoE16 at the same crystallization
temperature, indicating that the amount of defects was the largest
for iPPcoE16. According to the isothermal crystallization results,
pure γ for iPPcoE6, iPPcoE12, and iPPcoE16 was prepared by isothermal
crystallization at 90, 65, and 55 °C, respectively. The WAXD
curves of iPPcoE12 in pure α-form and pure γ-form are
shown in Figure 1 as
an example. As most diffraction peaks of the two polymorphs overlap
each other, the only difference is the two specific diffraction peaks,
(117)γ at 20.1° and (130)α at
18.8°.

Figure 1 Integrated one-dimensional (1D) WAXD curves of iPPcoE12 in pure
α-form (iPPcoE12-α) and pure γ-form (iPPcoE12-γ).

The differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) melting curves for
pure γ-form of the three samples are shown in Figure 2. For pure γ-form, one
melting peak located near the isothermal crystallization temperature
was observed. The melting temperature increased with decreasing content
of ethylene counits.51 The other broader
one located at lower temperature was due to the secondary crystallization54 during cooling from isothermal crystallization
temperature down to room temperature.

of iPPcoE6, iPPcoE12,
and iPPcoE16.

Because ΔHf (heat of fusion)
of γ-form for copolymers differs from its homopolymer counterpart
due to the different partitioning levels of ethylene counits in the
crystalline structure, the crystallinity was calculated by fitting
the one-dimensional WAXD curves into several Gaussian peaks53 instead of using DSC measurements. To further
investigate the difference between the pure γ crystallinity
measured by WAXD, lamellae thicknesses (dc) derived from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data for isotropic
samples at different temperatures are shown in Figure 3. The crystallinity continued decreasing
during heating because some unstable crystals melted at low temperature.
The lamellar thickness dc apparently increased
with increasing temperature. The increase of dc can be understood as a result of melting of the thinner lamellae
at elevated temperatures. In addition, dc for a sample with high content of ethylene counits was always higher
at the same temperature. The relatively higher
thickness of the lamellae was due to the participation55,56 of continuous long-chain segments of sample with high ethylene content
in the crystal during crystallization. The detailed 1D WAXD curves,
1D-SAXS curves, and correlation function curves for iPPcoE12-γ
are shown in Figure S3 in Supporting Information.

from SAXS data (right) of pure γ-form of iPPcoE6,
iPPcoE12, and iPPcoE16 as a function of temperature.

To investigate the recovery properties of pure
α-form and
pure γ-form, step-cycle tests have been carried out at different
temperatures. The variations of plastic strain and elastic strain
with total strain obtained from step-cycle tests at 25 °C for
iPPcoE12-α and iPPcoE12-γ are shown in Figure 4 as an example. In the beginning
of stretching, both elastic strain and plastic strain increased. The
recovery property for iPPcoE12-γ was better because its elastic
strain was higher than that of iPPcoE12-α at the same total
strain. The orthorhombic unit cell of γ-form contains nonparallel
bilayers, which are composed of 31 helices. For stretched
γ-form at small strain, crystallized chain segments tended to
move toward perpendicular to the fiber axis because chains lay diagonally
in ab-plane perpendicularly to the c axis. Such orientation
in this configuration was certainly unfavored so that the elastic
property was better in the beginning. The deformation mechanism changed
from crystalline block slip to disaggregation (melting)–recrystallization
process at critical point C, where elastic strain started to decrease
and plastic strain increased at a larger slope. The critical point
C for iPPcoE12-α was at around 0.8, whereas for iPPcoE12-γ
it was at 0.6, indicating the difference in the deformation mechanism
between the two crystalline polymorphs. For a deeper investigation,
tensile tests were carried out at different temperatures for the two
polymorphs.

Figure 4 Variation of plastic (εH,p) and elastic (εH,e) parts with total strain in step-cycle tests for iPPcoE12-α
and iPPcoE12-γ stretched at 25 °C.

Figure 5 shows
the
critical strain at point C as a function of crystallinity when stretched
at 25 and 60 °C for samples possessing pure α-form and
pure γ-form crystallites. The critical strain at point C for
sample with pure α-form was always located at 0.8 independent
of the stretching temperature and content of counits. Similar results
reported that critical point C was both 0.7 for form I in two P1B-based
copolymers with different contents of counits at room temperature,7 which was caused by the same interaction between
the entanglement amorphous chain and the crystalline blocks. However,
the strong dependence of the critical point C for samples with pure
γ-form crystallites on the stretching temperature and content
of counits has been observed for random propylene–ethylene
copolymers. To find the relationship between the critical point C
and the onset of destruction of original γ-form crystallites,
in situ WAXD measurements during stretching for samples with pure
γ-form have been carried out.

of crystallinity stretched
at 25 and 60 °C.

Selected two-dimensional (2D) WAXD patterns of iPPcoE12-γ
stretched at 25 °C are given in Figure 6 as an example. Raw 2D WAXD patterns and
1D WAXD curves during stretching are given in Figures S4 and S5 in Supporting Information. The isotropic
diffraction circles transformed into highly oriented diffraction points
during tensile tests. In addition, the diffraction point of (130)α in the meridian was observed at larger strain, indicating
the destruction of original γ-form crystallites followed by
recrystallization of the freed polymeric chain segments into α-form
by drawing. However, it was difficult to precisely judge transition
point by the appearance of (130)α in 1D WAXD curves
due to the weak intensity of the peak at the starting point. The evolution
of strong reflection peak of (008)γ may be regarded
as a signature to judge the transition point due to the following
reasons. In cross-β orientation mode with c axis parallel to fiber axis, (008)γ arc orientated
along the equatorial direction. For further stretching, the intensity
of the (008)γ arc became weaker, whereas the diffraction
arc close to meridian in the same plane became stronger at larger
strain, indicating that the meridian diffraction arc was not originated
from (008)γ. Because the transition from γ-form
to α-form has already started at larger strain indicated by
the diffraction point of (130)α and content of γ-form
continued decreasing, the meridian diffraction arc with increasing
intensity observed in (008)γ plane can only be due
to (040)α because they shared the same diffraction
peak, as shown in Figure 1. To quantify the orientation behavior of the plane (008)γ/(040)α, the orientation degree was
calculated using the Hermans orientation equation57  where ϑ denotes the angle
between the
normal direction of the plane and the reference axis. ⟨cos2 ϑhkl⟩ derived
from azimuthal scattering intensity distribution is defined as58  where I(ϑ) is the scattering
intensity along angle ϑ. It is important to note that the orientation
degree in the present case assumes values in the range of −0.5
≤ S ≤ 0. For a perfect orientation
of the lattice planes with their normal perpendicular to the stretching
direction, the order parameter is −0.5, whereas overall random
orientation gives 0.

Figure 7 depicts
the selected azimuthal scattering intensity curves of (008)γ/(040)α and the calculated orientation degree as
a function of strain for iPPcoE12-γ stretched at 25 °C.
For the sake of clarity, only the data from 180° to 360°
were shown. At lower strain, the diffraction intensity of (008)γ arc in equatorial direction increased, which was in
accordance with the cross-β orientation mode of γ-form.
For further stretching, the intensity of the arc close to meridian
increased, whereas the arc in equatorial direction decreased. The
degree of orientation weakened in the beginning because most crystalline
chains oriented perpendicular to the fiber axis. After the occurrence
of γ-form to α-form transition, more chains in α-form
orientated along the stretching direction, leading to a quick increase
of the orientation at larger strain. Therefore, the position of the
turning point in the plot of orientation degree was chosen to judge
when the transition started.

(008)γ/(040)α (left) and degree

°C.

All of the critical strains at
point C obtained from step-cycle
tests (details in Figures S7–S9)
and transition point derived from WAXD data (details in Figure S6) for samples with pure γ-form
of iPPcoE6, iPPcoE12, and iPPcoE16 are summarized in Figure 8. One finds a surprising coincidence
between the macroscopic critical point in mechanical tests and microscopic
transition point from γ-form to α-form. Macroscopically,
critical point C derived from step-cycle tests was defined as the
strain at which elasticity reached a plateau value due to change of
deformation mechanism from crystalline block slip to disaggregation
(melting)–recrystallization. For pure γ-form of random
propylene–ethylene copolymer, transition from γ-form
to α-form can only be achieved by stretching. The recovery property
for crystalline blocks started to decline once the transition occurred
because transition from γ-form to α-form was an irreversible
process. In addition, the elasticity of the stretching-induced α-form
was worse than that of γ-form in cross-β orientation mode.
Different from the α–β transition in poly(butylene
succinate), which occurred much later than lamellae-to-fibril transition,59 crystals in γ-form transformed into fibrils
in α-form, where chains were oriented along the stretching direction
via disaggregation (melting)–recrystallization. Therefore,
the critical point C derived from the step-cycle tests was strongly
influenced by the destruction of the original crystals in different
situations. As shown in Figure 8, larger critical strain was needed at higher stretching temperature,
which was similar to the crystal transition behavior of sPP.60 Besides, transition process occurred much earlier
for samples with less content of counits.

Figure 8 Critical point C obtained
from step-cycle tests and transition
point derived from WAXD data as a function of stretching temperature.

Clearly, destruction (melting)
of the original γ-form crystallites
during stretching requires a critical stress under which the crystallites
are no longer stable. The critical stress cannot be read directly
from the true stress–strain curves because the total stress
includes contributions from all components in the system, whereas
only those acting directly on the crystallites are responsible for
the transition. To investigate the critical stress of destruction
of the original γ-form crystallites at the transition point,
the Gaussian model of Haward and Thackray61,62 was employed. The model (shown in Figure S10 in Supporting Information) was composed of a Hookean elastic spring
in a series with an Eyring dashpot and a rubbery spring in parallel,
which can effectively describe all basic macroscopic effects occurring
during stretching of semicrystalline polymers. The crystalline phase
including the lamellar and block coupling was represented by the Hookean
elastic spring attached with Eyring dashpot.63 The rubbery spring stood for entangled network of amorphous chains.
Although the model did not consider three-phase structure in low-crystallinity
samples, it can still be applied to our case for the following reason.
In a three-phase structure, the above-mentioned coupling can be regarded
as the coupling between crystalline lamellar stacks. The rubbery spring
can still represent mechanical response of the stretched entangled
network. Figure S11 in Supporting Information
shows the estimation of the Hookean elastic constant E and the rubber elastic constant G on a plot of
true stress as a function of λ2 – 1/λ
(λ represents the draw ratio). The system was regarded as a
rubber filled with crystalline particles. And the effect of crystallinity
was reduced by using the Einstein relation.64 The critical stress of network at the transition point was defined
as  where αc is the crystallinity
measured by WAXD. Thus, the effect of crystallinity on the critical
stress was removed. The data of all of the Haward and Thackray plots
are shown in Figure S12 in Supporting Information.
Recently, Wang et al.65 have proposed that
the deformation of some copolymers deviated from the model due to
the strain-induced crystallization at very large strain. In fact, this effect scarcely occurred in our case, and the deformation
behavior abided by this model in the experimental draw ratio is shown
in Figure S12. As a comparison, the critical
stress of original α-form at the critical point calculated by
the Gaussian model of Haward and Thackray will also be discussed in
the following part.

Figure 9 shows the
critical stress of network for the destruction of α-form, which
is a quite stable polymorph as no polymorph transition occurs during
tensile tests. The deformation behavior of α-form was not influenced
by stretching temperature and content of counits. The destruction
of the original crystallites or the fibrillation process was controlled
by a constant critical stress of 3.1 MPa, indicating the same interplay
between the crystalline blocks and amorphous network in the samples
of pure α-form for the three copolymers.

Figure 9 Critical stress of network
of α-form calculated by the Gaussian
model of Haward and Thackray as a function of stretching temperature.

The critical stress of network
for samples in γ-form at the
transition point as a function of stretching temperature is given
in Figure 10. Unlike
the deformation behavior of α-form, the critical stress for
the destruction of γ-form kept constant at low temperature and
declined at high temperature. The critical stresses for the destruction
of γ-form for iPPcoE6, iPPcoE12, and iPPcoE16 were 2.1, 1.8,
and 1.7 MPa, respectively. The results indicated that higher critical
stress was needed to destruct the crystallites in γ-form for
samples with lower counit content. Although the chain sequence in
the molten state for each copolymer is the same, the deformation behavior
for pure α-form and γ-form differs a lot. It has been
reported52,66−68 that part of ethylene
chain went into crystalline region in propylene–ethylene copolymers,
which was confirmed by solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectra.
Besides solid-state NMR technique, the average length of isotactic
polypropylene (⟨Liso⟩ =
2[mm]/[mr] + 2)40 is also related to the
different degrees of inclusion of stereodefects and constitutional
defects in the crystals of iPP. Even though it is not clear whether
the different crystalline polymorph has an effect on the concentration
of defects in the lattice, the more extensive crystallization process66 indeed leads to a higher ethylene concentration
in the lattice. Pure α-form was prepared by a rapid cooling
process, whereas pure γ-form was prepared by a long crystallization
process at high temperature. We may conclude that the different thermal
history brought about the variations in the concentration of ethylene
in the lattice. The level of defects in the crystalline region for
pure α-form remains low for all of the three copolymers due
to the rapid crystallization. And the critical stress is higher than
that for pure γ-form. For pure γ-form, the concentration
of defects in crystalline region is highest for iPPcoE16 with the
highest content of counits. Samples with more defects in the unit
cell were much easier to be destroyed in the cross-β orientation
mode during stretching. The critical stress for the transition was
lower for samples in pure γ-form with higher content of ethylene
counits.

Figure 10 Critical stress of network of γ-form calculated by the Gaussian
model of Haward and Thackray as a function of stretching temperature.

Besides, the deformation temperature
had an influence on the phase
transition. As shown in Figure 10, for all three samples, the critical stress of the
destruction of γ-form during stretching kept constant at low
temperature and decreased at high temperature. The decreasing crystallinity
was excluded due to the following possible reasons. First, the effect
of crystallinity was removed in the calculation of critical stress.
In addition, the crystallinity continued decreasing with increasing
stretching temperature, which is shown in Figure 3, and only at higher temperature, the critical
stress started to decline. This result indicates that the crystallites
became less stable, requiring smaller stress to perform the destruction
process at high temperature. Temperature-dependent full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of the WAXD diffraction peak of (008)γ results
shown in Figure 10 may help to understand the situation. First of all, melting of unstable
crystallites with smaller size during heating would result in a decrease
in the FWHM as on average the size of the crystallites increases.
However, the FWHM of (008)γ diffraction peak for
iPPcoE6 shown in Figure 11 started to increase at 65 °C. Clearly, at high temperatures,
distortion of the crystalline lattice due to thermal motion of the
chain segments dominated the diffraction behavior, resulting in a
strong peak broadening. And the situations were similar for other
samples, including iPPcoE12 and iPPcoE16. We may conclude that destruction
of the original γ-form crystallites at high temperature can
proceed under lower stress due to the deterioration of the crystalline
order of polymer chains during heating.

Conclusions
In summary, stretching-induced destruction of
γ-form crystallites
in random propylene–ethylene copolymers with the similar molecular
weight occurred at the onset of lamellae-to-fibril transition, which
was evidenced by the fact that critical strain at point C and onset
strain of polymorph transition were located at the same position.
The critical stress of network for the destruction of original γ-form
crystallites was obtained, which depends strongly on the stretching
temperature and content of counits. The critical stress at the transition
point was higher for samples with lower counit content due to the
less partitioning of ethylene counits in the crystalline phase. In
addition, high stretching temperature made the critical stress lower
because the crystalline structure became less stable due to thermal
distortion of the crystallized segments.

history. Samples with pure α-form were prepared by quenching
the melt into water bath at room temperature. Samples with pure γ-form
were obtained by quenching the melt into water or oil bath at selected
isothermal crystallization temperature for sufficiently long time.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements have
been carried out on isotropic films before stretching. Besides, another
group of samples in pure γ-form with a different processing
method have been prepared for studying the critical stress for destructing
original γ-form crystallites of different thickness. The details
of preparation method, the raw data, and the final results for the
second group of samples are shown in Supporting Information (Figures S13–S16), which provide solid evidence to support our conclusion.

The DSC measurements were carried out with a DSC1 STARe System
(Mettler Toledo, Switzerland), which had been calibrated for temperature
and melting enthalpy using indium as a standard under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 K/min.

The SAXS measurements
were carried out on a modified Xeuss system
of Xenocs, France, equipped with a semiconductor detector (Pilatus
100 K, DECTRIS, Switzerland) attached to a multilayer focused Cu Kα
X-ray source (GeniX3D Cu ULD, Xenocs SA, France), generated
at 50 kV and 0.6 mA. The sample-to-detector distance was 1063 mm,
and the wavelength of X-ray was 0.154 nm. Each SAXS pattern was collected
in 30 min and background-subtracted. For the prepared films before
stretching, Lorentz correction was performed on the one-dimensional
scattering intensity curves due to the isotropic distributed stacks
of parallel lamellar crystallites. The correlation function K(z) was derived from inverse Fourier transformation
of the experimental intensity distribution I(q) as follows  which was used for calculating the thicknesses
of crystalline lamellae (dc), amorphous
layers (da), and the long period (dac) of the samples composed of two-phase layerlike
systems.69 The weight crystallinity measured
by WAXD was less than 50%, so the smaller value obtained from the
correlation function was assigned to dc, and da was then obtained as da = dac – dc.

The “Dog bone” tensile
bars with dimensions of 10
× 5 × 0.5 mm3 were obtained with the aid of a
punch. The tensile tests were carried out using a portable tensile
testing machine (TST 350, Linkam, U.K.) at different temperatures.
Optical images of the sample were employed to measure the strain of
the sample during testing. The Hencky measure of strain εH is used as a basic quantity of the extension, which is defined
as  where b0 and b are the widths of undeformed
and deformed areas, respectively.
In step-cycle experiment, the sample was stretched step-by-step at
a constant speed. After each step, inverse movement of the clamps
was performed to contract the sample until a stress of zero was achieved.
Then, the sample was stretched again at this given speed, until it
re-reached the point at which it left the initial curve. A stepwise
stretching of the sample with loading–unloading cycles was
combined in the process. The imposed strains were therefore decomposed
into a quasi-elastic (recoverable) part and a quasi-plastic (irreversible)
part. Details of step-cycle tests are shown in Figure S1 in Supporting Information.

In situ synchrotron
WAXD measurements during tensile tests at 20
μm/s were performed at beamline 1W2A, BSRF, Beijing. The wavelength
of X-ray radiation is 0.154 nm, and the sample-to-detector distance
is 166 mm. A 2D MAR CCD X-ray detector with a resolution of 2048 ×
2048 (pixel size = 79 μm) is used to acquire 2D WAXD patterns.
The primary X-ray beam was first positioned at the middle of the horizontally
placed sample strip. All of the WAXD patterns were collected within
100 s after every step under load and background-subtracted.
