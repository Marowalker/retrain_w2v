Lignin, a major component of lignocellulosic
biomass, is a valuable
source of phenolic and aromatic compounds. It is, therefore, vital
to develop strategies to selectively deconstruct lignin to valuable
chemicals. This study focuses on the kinetics of depolymerization
of lignin and the production of phenols via a microwave-assisted catalytic
process at mild conditions of 80 °C in dimethyl sulfoxide/water
medium. Four different catalysts used in this study, viz., Fe2O3, LaFeO3, ZrO2, and zeolite-Y
hydrogen (ZYH), were characterized for structure, specific surface
area, and surface morphology. The molecular weight reduction of lignin
and the evolution of phenolic monomers and oligomers were monitored
using various techniques, and the rate constants of lignin degradation
in the presence of different catalysts were determined using a continuous
distribution kinetics model, assuming scission of the lignin macromolecule
at any random position. The rate constants (min–1) followed the trend: ZYH (26 × 10–4) ≈
LaFeO3 (25 × 10–4) > ZrO2 (22 × 10–4) > Fe2O3 ≈ no catalyst (16 × 10–4).
Vanillic
acid (15 mg g–1) and methyl phenol (17 mg g–1) were the major phenolics obtained with LaFeO3, whereas coniferaldehyde (13 mg g–1) was
the major phenolic compound with Fe2O3. Vanillin
was produced at ca. 11 mg g–1 with both Fe2O3 and ZYH. LaFeO3 is shown to be a promising
catalyst for both molecular weight reduction of lignin and the production
of monomeric phenols, whereas the use of Fe2O3 results in the formation of only phenols, possibly via specific
end-chain depolymerization. The selectivities of the monomeric phenols
were higher with these two catalysts, whereas with ZYH and ZrO2, the selectivities of the oligomers were better. The reusability
of the catalysts and the effect of catalyst loading on kinetics of
lignin depolymerization were also evaluated.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Lignin
is the third major component of lignocellulosic biomass
with an aromatic backbone. It provides structural rigidity to plants
and has a cross-linked heterogeneous structure consisting of three
major phenolic monomers, viz., coniferyl, sinapyl, and coumaryl alcohols.
The amount of these monomers and the different linkages between them
vary according to the source of lignin. Paper and pulp industries
largely utilize the kraft pulping process for digestion of biomass
to produce paper, with lignin as the major by-product. An estimated
70 million tons of kraft lignin, also known as alkali lignin, is produced
annually worldwide as a low-cost product in addition to being burnt
within the industry to generate process heat.1 The conventional methods of lignin fragmentation can be classified
into thermal cracking, hydrolysis, catalytic reduction, and oxidation
reactions.2 The production of platform
aromatic compounds such as vanillin, syringaldehyde, and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde has been carried out by heterogeneous catalytic
oxidation of lignin. Vanillin has a wide range of applications as
a flavoring agent, antioxidant additive, antifoaming agent, vulcanization
inhibitor, and chemical precursor for pharmaceutical and agrochemical
industries.3

The alkaline oxidation
of lignosulfonates in air for the production
of vanillin is the only method implemented in the industry using lignin
as a raw material. It involves the reaction of lignin at high pH (14),
moderate temperature (ca. 150 °C), and high pressure (10 bar).4 The conversion of lignin using various oxide-based
catalysts in aqueous or alcoholic media in the presence of oxygen
under pressure is shown to produce 3–5% of vanillin.5 The yield increased slightly to 5.3% when Cu-doped
mixed oxide catalysts such as LaCo1–xCuxO3 and LaFe1–xCuxO3 were
used.6,7 Noble metal catalysts such as Pt- and Pd-supported
on CeO2, Al2O3, and modified carbon
were utilized at 353–458 K and 0.1 MPa O2 pressure
to increase the yield of vanillin up to 30%.8 These catalysts were used in a flow reactor at 80 °C for the
oxidation of vanillyl alcohol into vanillin with a conversion of 88–100%
and a selectivity of 92–98%. Transition-metal oxides such as
Co3O4, Co-ZIF-9, and noble metal (Pt and Pd)-supported
on carbon have been shown to be active for the oxidation of lignin
model compounds like aromatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes.9−12 Importantly, there are significant challenges involved in the oxidation
of whole lignin to chemicals, which include non-selective production
of products, requirement of strong oxidizing agents, and severe operating
conditions. Non-conventional methods of lignin oxidation such as mechanical,
electrochemical, sonochemical, and microwave-assisted processes are
used to carry out the reactions under milder conditions and to control
the production of hydroxyl radicals via Fenton effect.13

Microwave irradiation provides selective,
volumetric, and rapid
heating without significant thermal gradients in the reaction mixture
compared to conventional heating. This unconventional mode of heating
is reported for selective oxidation of lignin and its model compounds
in polar solvents such as water and acetonitrile in the presence of
H2O2. Microwave-assisted oxidation of the lignin
model compound, apocynol, was carried out using different types of
mesoporous silica (MCM-41, HMS, SBA-15, amorphous silica).14,15 The surface hydroxyl groups and the internal pore structure of the
silica materials were found to play a crucial role in the catalytic
performance. Some of the existing studies in the literature on microwave-assisted
and conventional catalytic conversion are summarized in Table 1.14−23

Solid acid catalysts such as zeolites, oxides, mixed
oxides, heteropoly
acids, and phosphates are important functional materials in the petroleum
industry. Solid acid catalysts are less toxic and less corrosive compared
to conventional acids such as H2SO4 and HCl.
The catalysts used in this study, that is, LaFeO3, Fe2O3, ZrO2, and ZYH, are selected based
on their total acidity which are 0.23, 0.38,0.41, and 0.51 mmol g–1, respectively.24−26 Zeolites are an important class of crystalline aluminosilicate materials,
whose acidity can be tuned by varying the Si/Al ratio in the framework.27 Even though the surface acid–base properties
are inherent and characteristic of oxides such as ZrO2,
the combustion-synthesized samples exhibit low acid–base site
distribution owing to the defect-free and crystalline nature of nanocrystals
of zirconia formed at high temperatures. Furthermore, LaFeO3 and α-Fe2O3 exhibit high value of dielectric
constant (ε′), that is, 400 and 250, respectively, at
a frequency of 1 kHz.28,29 The dielectric losses of Fe2O3 and LaFeO3 are around 2.5 and 2,
respectively, at frequencies between 1 kHz and 1 MHz.29,30 Therefore, these materials are potential candidates as catalysts
in the presence of microwave irradiation.

Dhar and Vinu31 reported the utilization
of polar solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for better conversion
of kraft lignin to phenolic monomers and dimers using microwaves.
DMSO has a polarity of 0.44 and the ability to completely solubilize
kraft lignin.32 The addition of water up
to 1:1 (v/v) to DMSO increases its polarity to 0.72, while fully solubilizing
kraft lignin in the solvent. This study aims to evaluate the effects
of polar organic–aqueous mixture such as DMSO/H2O on molecular weight reduction of kraft lignin, its depolymerization
kinetics, and the production of phenols using microwaves. Metal oxides
and zeolite have been used as catalysts to study the effect of different
properties such as total acidity and microwave-absorbing capacity
on the type of phenolics produced.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Catalysts
The
X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the catalysts depicted in Figure 1 show the nanocrystalline
nature of the synthesized powders.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the catalysts (a) ZYH,
(b) ZrO2, (c)
Fe2O3, and (d) LaFeO3.

Commercial zeolite-Y hydrogen (ZYH) exhibits the
diffraction peaks
of the faujasite structure in accordance with JCPDS no. 39-0218. The XRD profile
of ZrO2 can be indexed with JCPDS no. 80-0965, and it exhibits
the tetragonal phase of zirconia. The diffraction peaks of Fe2O3 are indexed to the hexagonal phase of α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 89-596). The XRD pattern of LaFeO3, indexed according to JCPDS no. 37-1493, exhibits an ideal
cubic perovskite structure. The dominant plane reflections such as
(533), (111), (104), and (121) were used to determine the crystallite
sizes of ZYH, ZrO2, Fe2O3, and LaFeO3, respectively. The crystallite sizes of these catalysts were
calculated using Debye–Scherrer equation33 and are listed in Table 2. The crystallite sizes of the catalysts are in the
range of 16–25 nm.

The average
pore diameter, pore volume, and crystallite size of
the catalysts are listed in Table 2. Figure 2 depicts the pore size distribution of the catalysts used in this
study. It is evident that ZYH exhibits a high pore volume with low
pore diameter, which reflects its microporous nature. Its micropore
area is 321 m2 g–1, and the external
surface area is 27.3 m2 g–1. On the basis
of the average pore diameter, it is evident that LaFeO3, Fe2O3, and ZrO2 are mesoporous
in nature. These materials exhibit hysteresis similar to those usually
found in solids consisting of aggregates of particles forming slit-shaped
pores with uniform size and shape. This is evident from their adsorption–desorption
isotherms available in the Supporting Information. Experimental adsorption isotherms with different shapes have been
reported in the literature for various gas–solid systems, and
they provide preliminary information about the pore structure of the
adsorbent. The specific surface areas of the catalysts, LaFeO3, Fe2O3, and ZrO2, synthesized
by combustion method are in accordance with the literature.34

The surface morphologies of the
catalysts are depicted in Figure 3. The combustion
synthesized samples are spongy in nature with numerous pores present
on the surface of the particles because of the release of gases during
the combustion process. Zeolite-Y is a molecular sieve with a three-dimensional
pore structure. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of ZYH
reveals a polygonal morphology.

2.2 Molecular
Weight Distribution (MWD) of Lignin
Degradation Products
The reaction samples containing unreacted
lignin, depolymerized lignin, and the low-molecular-weight products
were subjected to gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The detector
response in Figure 4a shows that peaks corresponding to the formation of low molecular
weight compounds are found in the chromatogram from catalytic experiments.
MWD of lignin- and microwave-treated samples is shown in Figure 4b. The overall MWD
shifts toward the low-molecular-weight region (2500–15 000
g mol–1), which is due to lignin depolymerization
by random cleavage of etheric C–O bonds and end-chain unzipping
of monomers to form low-molecular-weight products. Figure 5 depicts the change in number
average molecular weight (Mn) and weight
average molecular weight (Mw) of lignin
at different conditions. The Mn and Mw of lignin decrease with the increase in reaction
time because of the formation of lignin degradation products, whose
identity is described in Section 2.4. The highest decrease in Mw and Mn was observed with LaFeO3 and ZYH catalysts at a reaction time of 120 min. After 120 min,
no significant change in the Mw of lignin
was observed. It is also evident that the use of catalysts significantly
decreases the Mw of lignin compared to
the control experiment without any catalyst.

catalysts. (c) Kinetic plot for lignin degradation.

2.3 Kinetics of Lignin Depolymerization
The rate of depolymerization of lignin was analyzed using a continuous
distribution kinetics model. Reaction 1 describes
the chain scission of lignin of chain length x, which
is treated as a continuous variable. The rate constant, k(x), denotes the first-order depolymerization of
lignin, which is dependent on the chain length x. 1  

The population balance rate
equation
for the above reaction can be written as follows35−37 2  

In eq 2, Ω(x,x′) represents the stoichiometric
kernel, which describes the probability of cleavage of lignin chains
of length x′ to form products of chain length x and (x′ – x). It also characterizes the mode of cleavage of the lignin chain.
For the cleavage of etheric C–O or C–C bonds at any
random position along the chain, Ω(x,x′) = 1/x′.35−37 The integro-differential rate eq 2 can be solved analytically by converting it to an
ordinary differential equation by using the moment operator defined
as35−37 3  

The zeroth moment and first moment of the MWD can be obtained
by
setting j = 0 and j = 1, respectively. Equation 2, after the application
of moments, is transformed to35−37 4  

The rate of change
of zeroth moment and first moment can be expressed
as 5  

The zeroth moment, p(0)(t), and the first moment, p(1)(t), denote the molar and
mass concentrations of lignin,
respectively. Equation 5 is solved using the initial condition: p(0)(t = 0) = p0(0) to obtain the rate of change
of molar concentration, which is given by 6  

As the mass concentration is constant, one can divide both
sides
of eq 6 by p0(0) to express
it in terms of Mn and k′ (=kMn0). 7  

The use of catalysts
resulted in much better degradation rate compared
to lignin degradation in the solvent, which is evident from Figure 5c. The rate constant, k′, follows the trend: LaFeO3 (25 ×
10–4 min–1) ≈ ZYH (26 ×
10–4 min–1) > ZrO2 (22
× 10–4 min–1) > Fe2O3 (16 × 10–4 min–1) ≈ no catalyst (16 × 10–4 min–1). Ansaloni et al.38 reported
the production of low-molecular-weight products such as vanillin and
acetovanillone during the wet aerobic oxidation of industrial lignin
using LaFeO3. The low rate of molecular weight reduction
of lignin observed with Fe2O3 and ZrO2 can be partly attributed to the low specific surface area of the
catalysts and the amphoteric nature of these oxides. High depolymerization
rates observed in the presence of LaFeO3 and ZYH are attributed
to multiple factors such as high dielectric constant of the former,
and high Brønsted acidity and high micropore area of the latter.
It is worthwhile to mention that the rate constant denotes the depolymerization
of lignin in terms of overall reduction in its molecular weight, whereas
it does not account for the production of low-molecular-weight products
via specific end-chain scission mechanism. Therefore, the formation
of low-molecular-weight phenols can be expected when Fe2O3 is used as a catalyst.

2.4 Formation
of Phenolics and Their Characterization
The samples withdrawn
at different time intervals during the microwave-assisted
conversion of lignin in DMSO/water media were analyzed using liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for identification of low-molecular-weight
compounds. Importantly, without the use of catalyst, no detectable
phenolic monomer or oligomer were produced in significant concentration. Figure 6 depicts the chromatograms
of the lignin degradation products obtained using various catalysts.

Figure 6 Chromatograms
of lignin degradation products from catalytic solvolysis
experiments using (a) Fe2O3, (b) LaFeO3, (c) ZrO2, and (d) ZYH. The peaks detected include (1)
solvent, (2) m/z 274, (3) vanillin,
(4) coniferaldehyde, (5) m/z 350,
(6) methyl phenol, (7) vanillic acid, (8) m/z 226, (9) m/z 408, and
(10) m/z 366.

Vanillin (m/z 152 g mol–1) was identified as a major product at a retention
time of 1.42 min
when Fe2O3, ZrO2, and ZYH were used
as catalysts. The other by-products obtained along with vanillin in
the presence of Fe2O3 were coniferaldehyde (m/z 178 g mol–1) and
oligomers of m/z 274 and 350 g mol–1. The mass spectra of the monomers are available in
the Supporting Information. Vanillic acid
(m/z 168 g mol–1), the oxidation product of vanillin, was produced only when LaFeO3 and ZYH were used as catalysts. Other than vanillic acid,
methyl phenol (or cresol) (m/z 108
g mol–1) and a dimer of m/z 350 g mol–1 were also observed with
LaFeO3. The production of methyl phenol indicates the possible
demethoxylation of lignin with this catalyst. When ZrO2 was used as the catalyst, vanillin and oligomers with m/z 226 and 408 g mol–1 were observed.
Other than the dimer peaks and vanillin, the production of coniferaldehyde
in trace amount (0.8 mg g–1) was also observed when
ZrO2 was used as the catalyst. When ZYH was used as the
catalyst, the oligomers had m/z of
226 and 366 g mol–1, as indicated in Figure 6d.

Lignin degradation
in DMSO/water media takes place by the scission
of etheric β-O-4 and C–C α–β linkages.31 The dehydrating capacity of DMSO results in
the production of hydroxyl ions from both water and lignin.39 These hydroxyl ions are responsible for the
oxidation of lignin to vanillin in the presence of catalysts such
as Fe2O3, ZYH, and ZrO2. The production
of vanillic acid is due to further oxidation of vanillin by the water
present in the reaction media, which is attributed partly due to the
high surface acidity and specific surface area of ZYH and the polar
nature of LaFeO3. Duan et al.40 reported the formation of vanillin and coniferyl alcohol by low-temperature
microwave-assisted deconstruction of lignin using ethanol as a solvent.
The formation of coniferaldehyde in the presence of Fe2O3 can be attributed to the loss of water because of microwave
heating in the presence of DMSO. A significant number of dimers/oligomers
with m/z 227, 274, 350, 366, and
408 were observed in LC/MS. Establishing the exact structure of the
dimers/oligomers requires a detailed characterization of the compounds
by LC/MS–MS, which is beyond the scope of this study.

The major products such as vanillin, vanillic acid, methyl phenol,
and coniferaldehyde were quantified by using high-pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC). Figure 7 depicts the concentration profiles of the monomers with different
catalysts along with their molecular structure. With the Fe2O3 catalyst, the yield of vanillin increased from 7 mg
g–1 at a reaction time of 60 min to 13 mg g–1 at 120 min. Even with ZYH, a significant concentration
of vanillin (ca. 12 mg g–1) was obtained at 120
min. The production of vanillin is reported in several studies in
the literature with the use of metal oxides such as Co3O4, MnO2, and mixed oxides of Co–Mn
as catalysts.2 It is important to note
that high yields of vanillin to the tune of 60 wt % are reported in
aqueous media at high oxygen partial pressures at 7 h only from the
lignin model compound such as vanillyl alcohol, and not from lignin.41 The yields of vanillin from lignin with the
use of organic solvents such as CH3OH and CH3CN were low in conventional heating systems with noble metal catalysts
such as Pd/Al2O3.5 In microwave-assisted reactions, the yield of vanillin was ca. 10
wt % in alkaline media using organosolv lignin and La/SBA-15 as a
catalyst.21 In addition to vanillin, in
this study, reasonable yield of vanillic acid (15 mg g–1) at 120 min was observed with LaFeO3 as a catalyst. The
yield of vanillic acid reported in the literature is low, in alkaline
or aqueous media using La/SBA-15 or Co3O4 as
catalysts.10,22 It is also evident from Figure 7b,d that LaFeO3 aids in complete oxidation of vanillin to vanillic acid as
compared to ZYH. Moreover, the formation of methyl phenol up to 17
mg g–1 was observed only in the case of LaFeO3, which shows its efficacy toward demethoxylation of monomeric
units of lignin.

using (a)
Fe2O3, (b) LaFeO3, (c) ZrO2, and (d) ZYH.

The production of different
aldehydes such as syringaldehyde and p-hydroxy benzaldehyde
was reported during oxidation of
lignin using perovskite-type oxides in alkaline media.38 In this study, the yield of coniferaldehyde
was 12 mg g–1 when Fe2O3 was
used as the catalyst. Deepa and Dhepe42 carried out lignin depolymerization over solid acid catalysts such
as zeolites and sulfated zirconia for the production of aromatic monomers.
The molecular weights of products were in the range of m/z 100–200 g mol–1 when
Raney Ni-supported on acidic zeolites were used as catalysts. Zeolites
hindered the reaction between the parent lignin and other more reactive
lignin fragments and reduced the production of high-molecular-weight
oligomers. The yields of vanillin and coniferaldehyde were low (0–3
mg glignin–1) when ZrO2 was
used as the catalyst. On the basis of the total yield of quantified
phenols, the activity of the catalysts toward lignin depolymerization
can be ranked as follows: LaFeO3 (32 mg g–1) > Fe2O3 (23 mg g–1)
> ZYH
(18 mg g–1) > ZrO2 (4 mg g–1). Comparison of this trend with that of the rate constants of depolymerization
with these catalysts shows that even though the rate of molecular
weight reduction of lignin is low with Fe2O3, the use of this catalyst yields more monomeric phenols as compared
to ZYH or ZrO2. LaFeO3 outperforms all of the
other catalysts, both in terms of molecular weight reduction of lignin
and the formation of monomeric phenols.

The selectivities of
the monomers and oligomers were calculated
based on the area % of the LC/MS chromatograms. The use of catalysts
with high surface acidity, such as ZYH and ZrO2, led to
higher selectivity toward oligomers (60–70%) compared to phenolic
monomers (30–40%). On the other hand, high polarity oxides
such as LaFeO3 and Fe2O3 favored
the formation of phenolic monomers, with high selectivity of 80% recorded
with LaFeO3. Among all of the catalysts, the selectivity
of total phenolic monomers was low (ca. 30%) with ZrO2.

2.5 Quantification of Phenolic Alcohol Groups
Lignin is composed of different chromophoric groups such as phenolic
−OH, α-carbonyl, conjugated double bonds, and quinones.
The hydroxyl group (−OH) content is an important indicator
of lignin reactivity, as they give lignin its potential to be utilized
in a variety of technical applications such as thermosets, rubbers,
polymer blends and composites, polyurethane foams, and dispersants.
The concentration of total phenolic −OH groups from various
experiments is reported in Table 3. When 1:1 (v/v) DMSO/water-solubilized sample was
subjected to microwave irradiation, there was an increase in free
phenolic −OH content to 0.16 mmol g–1 because
of the formation of phenolic oligomers by lignin deconstruction. This
is because of the increased polarity of the DMSO/water mixture as
compared to pure DMSO. The highest concentration was obtained when
Fe2O3 was used as the catalyst. This is also
in line with the HPLC analysis, which showed maximum yield of vanillin
and coniferaldehyde. Other than Fe2O3, the use
of ZYH and LaFeO3 resulted in higher amount of vanillic
acid and oligomers, and hence, the total phenolic −OH content
in these samples is ca. 0.24 mmolOH/glignin.
With ZrO2, lowest total yield of free phenolic groups was
observed, which also substantiates the low yield of monomers and oligomers.

2.6 Characterization of the Spent Catalysts
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the spent catalysts
are depicted in Figure 8. The spent catalysts were separated by vacuum filtration from the
product mixture and dried at 105 °C for 4 h. Recycled LaFeO3, after the first experiment, shows a strong broad absorption
peak at 3316 cm–1 which corresponds to −OH
stretch. The sharp peaks at 1648 and 1028 cm–1,
corresponding to C=O and C–O stretch, respectively,
show that the carboxyl groups are adsorbed onto the surface of LaFeO3 after the reaction. Recycled Fe2O3 exhibits
a peak at 1028 cm–1, which corresponds to the O–H
deformation band. The peaks at 1138 and 1251 cm–1 are due to medium-to-strong O–C stretching vibrations. Spent
ZrO2 exhibits peaks at 1155 and 1473 cm–1 corresponding to C–O–C stretching vibrations. This
proves that deconstruction of lignin occurs on the surface of the
catalysts, and the moieties like C–O, O–H, and C=O
are the possible species getting adsorbed on the active sites.

2.7 Effect of Catalyst Reusability and Loading
on Lignin Depolymerization Kinetics
In order to evaluate
the activity of the used catalysts, spent LaFeO3 and ZYH
were used for lignin degradation reaction. These two catalysts were
selected to study the reusability as the use of these resulted in
higher rate of depolymerization in the first run. As outlined in Section 2.6, the catalysts
were simply separated from the reaction mixture and dried without
subjecting them to the regeneration process for the removal of surface-adsorbed
functional groups. Figure 9 depicts the kinetic plots comparing the activities of fresh
and spent LaFeO3 and ZYH for molecular weight reduction
of lignin. It is evident that the activities of the reused catalysts
are significantly lower than the fresh catalysts. The rate constant
of depolymerization, k′, decreased to 12 ×
10–4 from 25 × 10–4 min–1 for recycled LaFeO3, whereas for ZYH, k′ decreased to 10 × 10–4 from
26 × 10–4 min–1. This suggests
that suitable regeneration such as calcination of the catalysts has
to be performed in order to eliminate the surface-adsorbed moieties
such as C–O, O–H, and C=O, which hinder further
adsorption of lignin intermediates for reaction.

of molecular weight reduction of lignin
using (a) fresh and reused LaFeO3 and (b) fresh and reused
ZYH.

Catalyst loading is also an important
parameter, which affects
the rate of depolymerization and the evolution of products from lignin.
The rate of depolymerization of lignin was found to increase with
the increase in catalyst loading of LaFeO3 and ZYH, and
the kinetics are shown in Figure 10. The rate constant, k′, increased
to 141.5 × 10–4 min–1 when
2 g L–1 LaFeO3 was used as compared to
25 × 10–4 min–1 at 1 g L–1 loading. In the case of ZYH, k′
increased to 42 × 10–4 min–1 for 2 g L–1 loading from 26 × 10–4 min–1 for 1 g L–1. This shows
that significant enhancement in molecular weight reduction can be
achieved with high catalyst loading. This is also expected because
increase in overall mass of the catalyst will enhance the availability
of active sites, and hence, the rate of reaction. Interestingly, multifold
increase in the rate constant of lignin degradation was observed with
LaFeO3 as compared to ZYH at 2 g L–1 loading,
which can be attributed, atleast partly, to the greater influence
of dielectric nature of the catalyst, as compared to characteristics
such as specific surface area or acidity.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the microwave-assisted
deconstruction of lignin
in the DMSO/water medium was investigated for the first time using
catalysts such as Fe2O3, LaFeO3,
ZrO2, and ZYH. The activities of catalysts for the depolymerization
of lignin were analyzed using the change in MWD of lignin and the
evolution of low-molecular-weight phenols. The maximum change in MWD
was observed when ZYH and LaFeO3 were used as catalysts.
The rate constant of depolymerization based on molecular weight reduction
with different catalysts followed the trend: LaFeO3 ≈
ZYH > ZrO2 > Fe2O3 ≈
no catalyst.
The yield of total phenolic monomers followed the trend: LaFeO3 (32 mg glignin–1) > Fe2O3 (23 mg glignin–1) > ZYH
(18 mg glignin–1) > ZrO2 (4
mg glignin–1). The total phenolic −OH
content in the solution was quantified, and it was high when Fe2O3 was used (0.49 mmolOH/glignin) followed by LaFeO3 and ZYH (0.24 mmolOH/glignin). These major results showed that LaFeO3 is
a promising catalyst for both lignin deconstruction to low-molecular-weight
fragments via random chain scission and the formation of phenolic
monomers, whereas Fe2O3 is effective toward
the formation of phenols without significantly affecting the molecular
weight of lignin. The major phenolic compounds quantified in this
study include vanillin, vanillic acid, coniferaldehyde, and cresol.
A number of oligomers of molecular weight 226, 274, 350, 366, and
408 g mol–1 were identified. The observations also
show that the use of catalysts with higher dielectric constant, that
is, LaFeO3 and Fe2O3, leads to the
production of phenolic monomers with selectivity (70–80%) as
compared to acidic catalysts such as ZYH and ZrO2, which
promote the formation of oligomers with high selectivity (60–70%).
On the basis of FTIR analysis of the spent catalysts, it is deduced
that C–O, O–H, and C=O groups of the lignin macromolecule
are likely to be involved in the surface reactions. Furthermore, these
surface-adsorbed species lead to reduction in activity of the catalyst
when it is reused, suggesting the need for regeneration. Multifold
increase in rate of depolymerization was observed when the loading
of LaFeO3 was doubled.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Alkali (or kraft) lignin,
vanillin, vanillic acid, cresol, coniferaldehyde, commercial zeolite-Y
hydrogen (ZYH) (Si/Al = 30:1), and precursors for catalyst synthesis
such as lanthanum nitrate, iron nitrate, zirconyl nitrate, and glycine
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Pvt. Ltd. DMSO was purchased from
Merck, India. All of the reagents and catalysts were used as received.
Lignin used in this study is shown to contain high amount of coniferyl
alcohol-type monomeric units as compared to coumaryl and sinapyl-type
monomers via analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometric
study.43

4.2 Catalyst
Synthesis and Characterization
LaFeO3 (lanthanum
ferrate), Fe2O3 (ferrous oxide), and ZrO2 (zirconium oxide) were synthesized
by the solution combustion method using stoichiometric amounts of
lanthanum nitrate, ferrous nitrate, and zirconyl nitrate as precursors,
respectively, and glycine as the fuel. Combustion synthesis of LaFeO3, Fe2O3, and ZrO2 was carried
out at 300 °C according to standard procedures.34 All of the catalysts were calcined at 600 °C in air
ambience for 3 h prior to use in experiments. Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) profiles of the catalysts were recorded in a D8 Discover (Bruker)
diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 8°
min–1. The pore size distribution
of the catalysts was obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 porosimeter.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected at
77 K, and specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined
using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
methods, respectively. FTIR spectra of the catalysts were obtained
using an Agilent Cary 660 FTIR spectrometer in the wavenumber range
of 700–4000 cm–1 in the attenuated transmittance
and reflectance mode at a resolution of 2 cm–1.
The surface morphologies of the catalysts were characterized using
a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800 SEM).

4.3 Microwave Reactor Setup
A Microsynth
(Milestone Inc.) laboratory scale microwave reactor was used in this
study. The reactants were taken in a 500 mL round-bottom borosilicate
flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The round-bottom flask was fitted
inside the microwave reactor. The contents were thoroughly mixed during
reaction using a stirrer. The microwave was operated at 2.5 GHz with
a power range of 0–1200 W. The maximum microwave power and
temperature were set at 600 W and 80 °C, respectively. Samples
were withdrawn at regular time intervals between 0 and 120 min. An
infrared sensor detected the temperature of the glass vessel containing
the reaction mixture and controlled the power delivery to maintain
isothermal condition.

4.4 Sample Preparation and
Kraft Lignin Oxidation
Kraft lignin (5 g L–1) was solubilized in 300
mL of 1:1 (v/v) of DMSO/water mixture. The catalyst was added at 1
g L–1 to the reaction mixture for a majority of
the experiments, whereas 2 g L–1 loading was also
used for a selected few experiments. The preheating time and reaction
temperature were set at 30 min and 80 °C, respectively, based
on the volume (300 mL), vapor pressure, and boiling point of the solvent.
Although fast heating rates can be achieved by setting higher microwave
power, this can lead to localized hot spots in the reaction mixture
and degradation of lignin during the preheating period. The temperature
of the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 °C for 120 min with
continuous agitation. Samples were withdrawn at regular intervals
of time. The reaction vessel was cooled down to ambient temperature
after 120 min, and the solution was filtered to separate the catalyst,
which was subjected to further characterization.

4.5 Molecular Weight Analysis of Lignin Degradation
Products
The MWD of the lignin samples collected at different
time intervals was analyzed using a GPC (Agilent 1260 Infinity series).
The GPC consisted of a Polar Gel-M Column (7.5 × 300 mm), Rheodyne
injector with 50 μL sample loop, and a variable wavelength detector
set at 280 nm. DMSO was used as the mobile phase at 0.5 mL min–1. The column was calibrated using 12 poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) standards with molecular weight ranging from 500 to
3 × 106 g mol–1 to determine the
number average molecular weight (Mn),
weight average molecular weight (Mw),
and polydispersity index. The calibration curve was fitted to a first-order
polynomial with a regression coefficient of 0.99, which is shown in
the Supporting Information. Ringena et
al.44 reported the Mw and Mn of kraft lignin in DMSO/H2O/LiBr to be 9900 and 1300 g mol–1, respectively,
using pullulan standards. In this study, the Mw of lignin, calculated using PEG standard in DMSO/LiBr, is
8500 g mol–1.

4.6 Identification
and Quantification of Phenolics
The lignin degradation products
such as monomeric phenols and oligomers
were identified using LC/MS (Agilent 6120 Series Single Quadrupole
LC/MS). A Zorbax C-18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, pore size ≈
1.8 μm) was used. The mobile phase was a mixture of 75:25 (v/v)
water/acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min–1 in the isocratic elution mode. A variable wavelength detector was
set at 280 nm. The mass scan range was 500–1000 g mol–1. The identified products were quantified using a HPLC (Shimadzu
Prominence LC 2010AD) with a C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm) and
photodiode array detector. The mobile phase used for HPLC was a mixture
of 75:25 (v/v) water/acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min–1 in the isocratic elution mode. Pure compounds, viz.,
vanillin, vanillic acid, cresol, and coniferaldehyde, were injected
at different concentrations to obtain standard calibration curves.

4.7 Analysis of Phenolics Using Ionization Difference
Ultraviolet Spectrophotometry (IDUS)
This analysis was performed
using Δε-IDUS to quantify the phenolic alcohol groups
in the reaction mixture. The analysis principle is based on the bathochromic
and hyperchromic shifts in the absorption spectrum of lignin based
on ionization of the hydroxyl groups at alkaline conditions. This
is
valuable to understand the extent of depolymerization of lignin by
the catalysts. Aqueous buffers of pH 12 and pH 6 and a solution of
0.2 M NaOH were prepared. Kraft lignin solution was prepared at a
concentration of 10 g L–1 with 1:1 (v/v) DMSO/water
as the solvent. Standard calibration curves were plotted using solutions
of lignin in DMSO/water with concentrations between 0.1 and 5 g L–1. The analysis of phenolic groups in microwave-treated
samples was carried out by diluting 50 μL of the reaction mixture
with 4.95 mL of pH 6 and pH 12 buffer solutions to final concentrations
between 0.1 and 5 g L–1. The solutions were then
analyzed in a UV-spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 230–400
nm. The neutral (pH 6) spectrum of each sample was subtracted from
its alkaline (pH 12) spectrum to calculate the difference in absorbance
maxima at 300 and 360 nm. The total phenolic −OH content was
calculated according to standard correlations reported by Gartner
et al.45 and Zakis.46
