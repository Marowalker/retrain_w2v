Titanium silicate molecular sieve (TS-1) and acetic acid
efficiently
catalyze the oxidation of furan and furan derivatives to the corresponding
maleic acid (MA) in very good yields using hydrogen peroxide as an
oxidizing agent. The effect of various solvents, the effect of temperature,
reaction time, concentration of hydrogen peroxide, and quantities
of the catalyst on the MA yield was studied. With the best conditions,
MA is the sole product obtained after a fast and simple purification
by filtration and evaporation. Compared to the previously reported
methods, this work is a good compromise between the different reaction
parameters and offers a good alternative to the production of biosourced
MA.

1 Introduction
Four carbon 1,4-diacids
are at the center of intensive research.
Maleic (MA), malic, fumaric (FA), and succinic (SA) acids are among
the top 12 biobased molecules of the DOE’s list. They are widely
used in the chemical industry, through an important panel of applications,
for example, production of paints and coating, (un)saturated polyester
resins, plasticizers, copolymers, lubricant additives, and preservatives
in food and beverages.1,2 They can be used to replace products
from the petroleum-derived feedstock, such as phthalic anhydride or
adipic acid. MA is also particularly interesting as a key building
block because of its ability to be transformed into 1,4-diacids mentioned
previously and other products like maleic anhydride, butanediol, and
tetrahydrofuran (Scheme 1).3,4

Scheme 1 Outline of Potential Chemical Derivatives from Maleic
Acid
As MA is the hydrated form of maleic anhydride
the most widespread
derivative, the MA market can be studied through maleic anhydride
production. Currently the production of maleic anhydride is estimated
to be more than 2000 kt per year. Industrial production of maleic
anhydride primarily needs petrochemical fossil resources. The most
important processes are a selective vapor-phase oxidation of butane,5,6 insaturated C4 (butene),7,8 and benzene,9 using O2 as an oxidant. The main byproducts
of these transformations are CO and CO2. Then maleic anhydride
is converted into MA by hydration processes. In previous years, the
price of maleic anhydride ranges from 1.5 to 2.00 $ per kg.

Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are biomass-derived
molecules. These compounds are obtained by dehydration under acidic
conditions of sugars such as xylose or arabinose contained in hemicelluloses
and lignocellulosic agro residues. Currently, annual production of
furfural is estimated around 250–400 ktons, mainly produced
in China.10

Many research groups
have explored oxidation of furfural and HMF
to MA or maleic anhydride under various conditions with homogeneous
or heterogeneous catalysis in a gas or liquid phase.

In the
liquid phase of several oxidation processes, it is often
hydrogen peroxide which is used as an oxidant.11−14 Hydrogen peroxide is regarded
as an ideal oxidant in terms of atom economy, availability, and green
metrics, so it is particularly relevant as a green oxidant for safe
industrial processes in a continuous flow mode.15 The main disadvantage of hydrogen peroxide is its instability
and the risk of an explosion from concentrated solutions by disproportionation.
By comparison, when oxygen is used as an oxidant, the temperature
between 363 and 383 K and a high pressure of 10–20 bar will
be needed.16−22

The specifications of the transformation are very complex.
This
still remains a challenge for the industrialization of a process.
Selectivity, yield, reaction time, energy, stability, and recyclability
of the catalyst, weight percentage of furan derivatives, and industrial
hygiene are among the criteria that need to be adequately controlled.
Previous results only partially achieved the objectives; there remains
a lot of work to do.

For example, Shi et al. reported the optimum
yield (49%) and selectivity
of MA (52%) obtained with the mixture of heteropolyacids and copper
nitrate H3PMo12O40 + Cu(NO3)2 (ratio: 2/1) as catalysts. The oxidant is oxygen, with
a pressure of 20 atm. The solvent is water, temperature is 371 K,
and reaction time is 14 h. However, MA extraction of the reaction
mixture and recyclability of the catalyst were not reported.18

In 2014 and 2017 Fagundez et al. reported
the selective aqueous-phase
oxidation of furfural to MA using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant
and titanium silicalite as a catalyst.23,24 Under optimal
reaction conditions, MA was obtained in a high quantity. For example,
a 78% yield of MA was reported using an H2O2/furfural molar ratio of 7.5, with a furfural/TS-1 wt % ratio of
1.0 at 323 K during a 24 h period of the reaction time. Furfural (4.6
wt %) was used. Moreover, 92% of MA was reported, using a two-step
sequence of reactions conducted with two catalysts TS-1 and Amberlyst
70 consecutively. In this case, the H2O2/furfural
molar ratio was 4.4, at 323 K and the reaction time was 52 h. Although
Ti leaching was observed, the catalyst was reused for six runs without
noticeable deactivation. In addition, interesting results have been
reported by Wang et al. who demonstrated efficiency and selectivity
of furfural oxidation with formic acid to get 2(5H)-furanone with a small amount of SA and MA.11 Recently, with a different protocol and conditions, Zhang et al.
have demonstrated the possibility to get an excellent selectivity
and yield of MA by oxidation of furfural using formic acid as a solvent
and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. However, a small amount of furfural
(1.5 wt %) was used, and the effect of the furfural concentration
was not reported. Best conditions were observed in a sealed tube with
a H2O2/furfural molar ratio of 6 at 60 °C
in 4 h which yielded 95% MA.12 Among the
latest contributions in this line of research, this year, Yang et
al. reported the synthesis of MA from furfural in the presence of
a KBr/graphitic carbon nitride catalyst and hydrogen peroxide under
optimized conditions a very good yield of 70% MA is obtained.25

Other research teams have reported MA
production with an acidic
catalyst in a liquid phase, but MA was produced in lower yields with
a mixture of products.13,14 Various representative oxidation
methods are summarized in Table 1, clearly showing the advantages and disadvantages
of each.

In the liquid phase, these transformations often follow
Baeyer–Villiger’s
oxidation mechanisms, which were recently demonstrated with high efficiency
on levoglucosenone derived from biomass with different biocatalysts
in an aqueous or organic and aqueous phase. The catalysts are based
on organic acid such as m-CPBA or acetic acid26,27 enzyme28−30 or metal-zeolite31 and
even without organic solvents and without catalysts.32

Because Taramasso and co-workers have reported the
preparation
of a titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1, MFI structured) molecular sieve,
this catalyst has exhibited very interesting properties in order to
facilitate a series of oxidation reactions.33 TS-1 enables oxidation under mild conditions, and it is produced
in an industrial scale and is robust and relatively cheap. After use,
pyrolysis of TS-1 at 823 K regenerates its catalytic properties. TS-1
is one of the most efficient solid catalysts, useful in developing
sustainable chemical processes.

In this work, we report that
TS-1 combined to acetic acid is a
very efficient method for oxidation of biomass derivatives such as
furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural and furan, to produce MA. The conditions
of the double catalytic system have been optimized with furfural to
get the highest yield of MA. The use of acetic acid is an advantage
because it is a less corrosive acid than other organic acids such
as formic acid or p-toluene sulfonic acid, AcOH pKa = 4.7 versus HCOOH pKa = 3.7 or APTS pKa = −6.5.
In addition, acetic acid is more cost effective economic and can be
biobased. Parameters such as the H2O2/furfural
ratio, the catalyst amount, and the temperature have been studied.
Finally, a good compromise has been reached between the criteria like
reaction time, yield, and furfural concentration leading to MA as
the sole product (Table 1).

2 Results and Discussion
The solvent
effect is an important parameter during chemical transformations.
The solubility of the reagents and the products as well as the miscibility
of the different liquid phases play a significant role on the selectivity,
kinetics, and the yield of the products. The effect of different physicochemical
properties such as the boiling temperature, polarity, ability to form
hydrogen bonds, and so forth, was tested via a selection of solvents.
As previously reported, and in addition to the role of the solvent
in TS-1, this chemistry is crucial in relation to its effects on kinetics.
It assists the sorption/desorption of reagents/products in TS-1 (passive
role) and participates in the catalytic cycle, through interactions
with polar species involved in it (active role).36 To compare the solvent effect, all the other parameters
of the reaction were kept constant (concentrations, temperature, stirring).
To do this, we used a Radleys Carousel Station device which allows
a six batch simultaneous reaction in parallel under the same conditions
(Table 2).

e 5-OHF = 5-hydroxy-furan-2(5H)one.

As we can see in Table 1, after a reaction time of 4 h at 80 °C, almost
all the
solvents gave a low yield of MA between 4 and 16%. By contrast, a
very good result was observed with acetic acid, which gave 59% of
yield, followed by cyclohexane which gave 43%. It is remarkable that
after 4 h of reaction most of the solvents with the exception of acetic
acid and cyclohexane gave a higher yield of 5-hydroxy-furan-2(5H)one (5-HFO) than MA, meaning that the oxidation reaction
is slower, less selective, and partial. With the exception of water
aprotic solvents like acetone, acetonitrile and ethylacetate seem
to favor the formation of 5-HFO (entries 5, 6, 8, 9). In the particular
case of dimethylsulfoxide, the latter is in competition with furfural
in the oxidation reaction and dimethylsulfone was obtained exclusively.
Note that with organic solvents immiscible with the aqueous phase
of hydrogen peroxide, a very good or total conversion of furfural
was observed (entries, 8, 9, 10). MA is very soluble in the aqueous
phase37 (443 g L–1 at
25 °C); therefore, a complete oxidation of furfural into MA leads
to the enrichment of this phase. However, the intermediate oxidation
products are more soluble in the organic phase. In the case of 5-HFO,
its migration and its concentration in the organic phase explains
the measured yields for this product when an immiscible solvent is
used. The production of 5-HFO is evidence of the oxidation reaction
mechanism, which certainly starts with a Baeyer–Villiger oxidation.
We will see later further evidence in favor of this hypothesis.

Acetic acid and acetonitrile are two solvents often reported and
described as the best in the conversion and oxidation of HMF and furfural
to maleic anhydride under homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis conditions,17,19,20 and acetic acid is found to be
a particularly effective solvent in the presence of a vanadium catalyst
to obtain MA.21,22

On the basis of these initial
results, we investigated the optimal
conditions for the transformation of furfural in the presence of acetic
acid and TS-1 using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.

Several
oxidant species are present under these conditions. Hydrogen
peroxide reacts with acetic acid to give peracetic acid.38,39

The mixture of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid should
be a
stronger oxidizing system than hydrogen peroxide alone because the
oxidation potential is pH-dependent following the Nernst equation
(E = E0 – 0.059
pH). Moreover, it has been established that Ti(IV) center in the TS-1
catalyst is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in several Ti-hydroperoxo
and Ti-peroxo species which act as strong oxidizing agents (Scheme 3).40

Note that formic acid is released during processing.
The peracid
of formic acid can therefore, also partially participate in the oxidation
process (Scheme 2).

and Ti-Hydroperoxo,

The comparative study of MA obtained in the
presence or absence
of the catalyst TS-1 in acetic acid, clearly demonstrates the gains
obtained by this double catalyst system. The result observed after
1 h of the reaction is particularly interesting; the yield of MA is
almost twice as high as the reaction carried out without TS-1, and
it is slightly higher than the yield of MA obtained in 4 h of the
reaction without TS-1. TS-1 in the presence of acetic acid has an
effect on both the kinetic parameters and global yield of the reaction.
Under these conditions, the catalytic contribution of TS-1 is essential.
The conversion of furfural is very fast in all cases, after half an
hour of reaction time almost all the furfural was consumed, 83% in
AcOH and 96% in the mixture of AcOH and TS-1. There is no more furfural
after 1 h of the reaction. Traces of 5-hydroxy-furan-2(5H)-one and other secondary intermediates were observed but not quantified.

In comparison with other oxidation methods, it is important to
note that under our conditions, no cis trans isomerization of MA was
observed.41 It is well known that acidic
conditions with heating catalyze the reversible addition of protons
which induce a free rotation of the central C–C bond and the
formation of more stable FA.

First the effect of the amount
of the TS-1 catalyst was studied
at 80 °C, in the presence of 8 equiv of 35% aqueous hydrogen
peroxide in acetic acid (Table 3, entries 1–4). Without TS-1, 42% of MA was produced
after a reaction time of 4 h. When an amount of 0.9 wt % of TS-1 is
added, the yield of MA increases by 7 or 49% MA. Doubling the amount
of the catalyst to 1.8 wt % further increases the yield of MA to 60%.
In view of these results, the mass quantity of the catalyst was further
doubled to 3.6 wt %, but after 4 h of reaction a near equivalent yield
of MA at 61% was observed. As we have seen in the comparative study
of oxidation of furfural in the presence or absence of catalyst TS-1
in acetic acid. The conversion of furfural and the yield of MA are
more rapidly achieved in the presence of TS-1 (Figure 1 and Table 3, entry 4). However, increasing the amount of the catalyst
above 1.8 wt % does not make it possible to increase the yield of
MA beyond 60%. We can conclude that a small amount of the 1.8 wt %
catalyst is sufficient to achieve the maximum MA yield in a reasonable
time.

Figure 1 Comparison of the MA yield (blue and red lines) and furfural conversion
(green and purple lines) depends on the catalytic system AcOH vs AcOH
and the TS-1 catalyst. Reaction conditions: 2.6 mmol of furfural,
14.0 mmol of H2O2 (35% aq. sol.), equivalent
to H2O2/furfural mole ratio = 5.4, with and
without 0.1 g of catalyst TS-1, 3.8 mL AcOH, 80 °C, 4 h.

The effect of the reaction temperature has also been
studied. Increasing
the temperature from 60 to 100 °C makes it possible to obtain
the maximum yield of MA more quickly. For example, with 8 equiv of
hydrogen peroxide at 100 °C in 1 h, 48% of MA will be obtained,
more than double the amount of MA obtained at 60 °C in 1 h (Table 3, entries 5 and 7).
Note that the maximum yield of MA is 62% even after 4 h of the reaction
at 100 °C. The extension of the reaction time to 8 h does not
increase the yield, but no byproduct or degradation of MA has been
observed, which provides good information on the stability of MA under
these conditions. No isomerization to FA occurs.

Finally, we
studied the effect of the variation with the equivalent
number of hydrogen peroxide (Table 3, entries 1–15). Based on the stoichiometry
of the reaction, at least 3 equiv of hydrogen peroxide were required
to oxidize furfural to MA. Nevertheless, when a little more than 4
equiv of hydrogen peroxide were used, a maximum of 32% of MA was obtained.
We know that hydrogen peroxide begins to decompose quite rapidly by
disproportionation into water and oxygen when the temperature reaches
60 °C. Therefore, we can expect a loss of the oxidant by degradation
under our conditions. However, it should be noted that hydrogen peroxide
under such conditions has finally been determined as being much more
stable than expected. An excess of the oxidant is still necessary.
In fact when the experiment is performed at 100 °C, 10 equiv
H2O2 will be of an adequate amount and necessary
to achieve the maximum possible yield of MA in 2 h (Table 3, entry 14). Working with 6
equiv of the oxidant leads to a good yield of MA, between 52 and 59%,
which means that a decrease in the amount of hydrogen peroxide below
this amount is not appropriate. Because hydrogen peroxide is relatively
inexpensive, in order to be sure of getting the maximum MA yield,
a good compromise is to use 8 equiv of hydrogen peroxide. Finally,
we can conclude that the greater the amount of the TS-1 catalyst and
the higher the amount of the oxidant and temperature, the faster the
MA is produced to a maximum yield of 60%. Note that even under the
harshest conditions, 100 °C and 10 equiv of hydrogen peroxide,
the maximum yield is achieved without overoxidation and without isomerization
of the MA formed.

Because titanium silicalite (TS-1) is a heterogeneous
catalyst,
the process for purifying the MA obtained consists of a simple filtration
followed by evaporation of the reaction medium. The purification process
is crucial when taking into account an industrial process. It must
be the simplest and most economical possible. Our method is very relevant
from this point of view.

Although a small amount of the catalyst
was used, rather than systematically
discarding it, we tried to recycle it. However, during the reaction,
the magnetic bar used for stirring crushed and divided the catalyst
into very fine particles, which resulted in the end of the transformation
to obtain a paste that could be filtered on Celite to separate the
reaction mixture, but not completely on sintered glass. Nevertheless,
at least 50% of the catalyst TS-1 was recovered after filtration,
leaving us no choice but to add a new catalyst to complete and restart
a new cycle. The centrifugation of the reaction mixture could have
been a solution but it is not adapted to a simple industrial process,
so we have discarded it. In addition, knowing that TS-1 tends to slowly
lose some of its titanium, we gradually added a portion of the fresh
catalyst during the cycles; this allowed us to maintain a maximum
yield from the transformation by saving a complete new addition. This
could be observed over 4 cycles while maintaining the maximum yield
of MA using the optimum conditions at 80 °C, 8 equiv of hydrogen
peroxide, 1.8 wt % of the catalyst for 4 h. Note that under these
conditions the amount of hydrogen peroxide remaining is less than
0.015 mol dm–3 or 0.5% of the initial hydrogen peroxide,
which was not a problem during small-scale evaporation. On an industrial
installation, continuous evaporation should be provided to avoid concentration
of residual hydrogen peroxide and add a control system.

Because
the catalyst was being ground during the reaction its macroscopic
appearance changed, and from this we wanted to know if morphological
differences also appeared on the microscopic scale. We therefore,
analyzed catalyst samples before and after the reaction by electron
microscopy. In order to eliminate any traces of organic residues after
the reaction, we carried out a heat treatment at 823 K of the catalyst
used before.

As can be seen from the electron microscopy images,
we cannot distinguish
any difference in morphology between the catalyst before and after
the reaction. No chemical degradation was detectable, so the structural
integrity was therefore preserved (Figure 2).

after recycling
followed by pyrolysis at 823 K, 6 h.

The method was extended to other furan derivatives,
under optimized
oxidation conditions of furfural with 1.8 wt % TS-1, with 8 equiv
of 35% aqueous hydrogen peroxide, at 80 °C for 4 h (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Oxidation of Different
Furan Derivatives under Optimized Reaction
Conditions Obtained with Furfural
In all cases the oxidation leads to the formation
of MA but in
variable proportions, which is significant for the reaction mechanism.
The best yield was obtained with 2(5H)-furanone which
gave 76% of MA. The use of furan also resulted in a good MA yield
of the order of 58%. With furfuryl alcohol only 49% of MA will be
obtained. Considering that furfuryl alcohol must first be oxidized
to furfural, it requires an additional oxidant equivalent compared
to furfural, which could explain the difference in the yield observed
with furfural. With HMF which has an additional carbon, it would require
at least two additional oxidant equivalents, the yield of MA observed
was even lower at 44%. However, with diformylfuran and furoic acid,
which are, respectively, the oxidized species of HMF and furfural,
the yields of MA were 36 and 19%. These latter results indicate that
these compounds are most likely not oxidation intermediates in the
reaction sequence while the 2(5H)-furanone is very
likely to be one, signifying a mechanism for its formation (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Possible Pathway
and Mechanism of Oxidation of Furfural to MA
[O] is an oxidizing
agent, for
example, hydrogen peroxide, peracid or titanium silicalite (hydro)
peroxo species. Pathway I: refs;23,42−47 pathway
II: refs;34,48 pathway III: ref (23); and pathway IV: refs.12−14

Based
on the oxidation mechanisms described in the literature,
four types of reaction paths are conceivable (Scheme 5). Routes 123,42−47 and 234,48 resulting from furoic acid as the first
oxidized species of furfural are unlikely, in fact the yield of MA
obtained from furoic acid is 19%. While following path 2 the yield
obtained from furan (58%) made it possible to speculate on the hypothesis
of a mechanism involving furan as an intermediate associated with
the formation of singlet oxygen generated from peroxo and hydroperoxo
titanium species. This path 2 is also excluded because furoic acid
is an upstream precursor in this reaction sequence. On the other hand,
paths 323 and 412−14 involving a
Baeyer–Villiger oxidation step seem more in agreement with
our results. The most convincing element in favor of path 4 being
the very good yield obtained from 2(5H)-furanone
(76%). Because no intermediate of path 3 between furfural and 5-hydroxy-furan-2(5H)-one has been tested or observed, we cannot exclude this
reaction mechanism. At this stage of our investigation, we therefore,
believe that MA obtained is essentially derived from reaction path
4.

3 Conclusions
We have developed an effective
method for the production of MA
from furfural and other furan derivatives, which are biobased products.
The oxidant used was hydrogen peroxide, which is a green oxidant.
The developed method is composed of a double catalytic system consisting
of acetic acid and TS-1 titanium silicalite. Note that acetic acid
is a cheap industrial product and less corrosive compared to other
organic acids such as formic acid; moreover, acetic acid can be biosourced
from the fermentation of sugar, ethanol, or cornstarch. Titanium silicalite
(TS-1) is also produced industrially. TS-1 is advantageous because
it is robust and selective for oxidation; moreover, it can be filtered
and regenerated by pyrolysis, which facilitates the purification step
and may allow some recycling. We have demonstrated that a small amount
of this 1.8 wt % catalyst is sufficient with this method. This catalytic
system is very effective in accelerating the reaction. In 4 h the
total conversion of furfural was observed and a high yield of 62%
MA was obtained as the only product without the mixing with FA. A
furfural mass proportion of 4.3 wt % was used, which is relatively
important compared to certain mass percentages reported in the literature.
For all these reasons, we believe that this method is a good compromise
between the different parameters, time, temperature, and wt % mass
of furan derivatives and catalyst, while maintaining very good yields
of MA which can meet the industrial challenge of the production of
biosourced MA and is part of a sustainable development context. Based
on these results, we are currently working on the development of a
continuous flow of MA production.

4 Methodology of Experiments
All of the
reagents are of analytical purity grade and were used
without further purification. All products or solvents and reagents
were purchased either from Fischer Scientific or Merck.

4.1 Preparation and Characterization of TS-1
Catalyst samples were prepared with a slight modification of the
procedure described by Taramasso and others.33,49 ,50 Optimum Ti insertion of [Ti]/([Ti] + [Si])
= 0.025 or 2.5% was targeted. Characterizations by X-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) are in agreement with TS-1 characteristics of
the literature data. Additional information for catalyst preparation
and procedures for characterizations are provided in the Supporting Information.

4.2 Analytical Methods
All products were
analyzed and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). Calibration curves were obtained from a commercial sample
with the exception of 5-hydroxyfuranone which was prepared following
the procedure described by Kumar and Pandey.34

4.3 General Procedures for Furfural Oxidation
Typically, 2.6 mmol of furfural, hydrogen peroxide (aq. 35%) with
a H2O2/furfural molar ratio between 4 and 10
(0.9–3.2 mL), and TS-1 as a catalyst (0–0.2 g) was stirred
in 2.8–4.1 mL of solvent depending on the quantity of hydrogen
peroxide used at a temperature between 333 and 373 K during 1 to 4
h. After this, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
filtered and evaporated, or filtered and diluted with water in a volumetric
flask prior to HPLC analyses.

Furfural conversion and product
yields were calculated according the following formulas:    

nsubstrate0 corresponds to the mole
quantity of furfural
initially loaded into the reactor, and nsubstrate and nproduct refer to the number of
moles of furfural and products in the reaction mixture at a given
time. The HPLC chromatographic factor of the organic products was
calculated by analyzing solutions with known concentrations of the
different organic products. Additional information is available in
the Supporting Information.
