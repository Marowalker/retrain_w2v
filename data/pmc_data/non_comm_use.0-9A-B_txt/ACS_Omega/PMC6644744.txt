γ-Alumina-supported
catalysts with varying copper loadings
(5–25 wt %) were prepared by incipient wet impregnation and
characterized by various characterization techniques. These catalysts
were tested for the selective hydrogenation of octanal in a mixture
containing 10 wt % octanal and 2 wt % octene diluted in octanol. The
reactions were carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor
in a down flow mode with varying pressures, liquid hourly space velocities,
and hydrogen (H2)-to-aldehyde molar ratios. The catalyst
activities were assessed over a temperature range between 100 and
180 °C using hydrogen gas as the hydrogen source. The results
obtained showed that under these experimental conditions, copper preferentially
hydrogenates the aldehyde and the copper content exhibited no significant
influence on the catalyst activity or product selectivity. Kinetic
modeling revealed that both octanal and octene hydrogenation were
first-order reactions, although octene conversion was very low until
octanal conversion had reached a significant level. The activation
energy for octanal hydrogenation is higher than the octene hydrogenation.
A maximum octanal conversion of >99% was obtained at 160 °C,
and the best selectivity toward octanol of 99% was achieved at 100
°C (53% conversion). The pressure played a small role with regards
to octanal conversion and selectivity toward octanol, whereas it exhibited
a significant influence on the octene conversion. Increasing the hydrogen-to-aldehyde
ratio was found to have a direct influence on both octanal and octene
conversion.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Catalytic
hydrogenation has been one of the most widely studied
chemical reactions to date.1 This is mainly
because of its wide range of industrial applications including the
commercial production of organic compounds. For example, aldehydes,
the primary product from the hydroformylation of alkenes, have very
little industrial importance. They are typically converted to alcohols,
which are sought after mostly for the preparation of plasticizers
and detergents.2 Dehydration of these alcohols
produces alkenes. Industrially, 1-heptene is converted to the more
lucrative 1-octene by Sasol using this route. Separation and recycling
of any unreacted alkenes is most easily facilitated when mixed with
the alcohol because of a greater difference in their relative boiling
points.

Generally, the reduction of C=C bonds is thermodynamically
favored compared to that of C=O bonds by approximately 35 kJ
mol–1.3,4 The chemoselective hydrogenation
of carbonyl bonds over C=C bonds from the hydroformylation
product stream would enable the production of valuable alcohols as
well as recycling of the unreacted alkene back into the feedstock.

A wealth of processes and applications in the petrochemical industry
is based on catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons by
heterogeneous catalysts.5 Platinum group
metals such as platinum, rhodium, and palladium have traditionally
been employed for these reactions because they require fairly mild
reaction conditions. Nonprecious metals such as nickel (Raney nickel)
have also been used as economical alternatives.6 The disadvantages of the latter, however, are lower conversions
and more stringent reaction conditions. Industrially, the deciding
factor is activity versus cost. To date, the vast majority of the
literature dealing with the selective hydrogenation of aldehydes over
alkenes reports cases in which the double bond and the aldehyde group
are present in the same molecule. Most research has therefore focused
on the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes
to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols5,7−9 in batch processes.10−14

The present research effort, however, has focused
on hydrogenating,
selectively, a saturated aldehyde in a mixture containing an alkene
using a liquid-phase, high-pressure, continuous flow fixed-bed system.
For the hydrogenation of aldehydes, the desired product is the primary
alcohol. It is believed that the catalyst binds hydrogen and the unsaturated
substrate and facilitates their union as described by the accepted
Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism.15 The
“theory of electronic effects” describes how the electronic
structures of the catalyst active site and of the reactant molecules
influence the catalyst activity and the substrate behavior, respectively.16−18 Both can act as either electron donors or acceptors. Besides electronic
effects, spacial geometry, thermodynamics, reaction conditions, and
interaction of hydrogen with the catalyst surface can influence the
catalytic activity.18−20 According to the “band theory”, the
d and s bandwidths of transition metals overlap.21 The positively charged metal ions have closed electron
shells in which electrons, with partially occupied d-bands, are not
tightly bound to the nucleus and thus are mobile.22,23 This results in variation in the degree of occupancy of the d-band.24 Copper has the electron configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s1, that is, a full d-band and an unpaired electron
in the s-band. Because the presence of unpaired electrons in the d-band
is essential to hydrogen chemisorption, copper does not readily adsorb
hydrogen and is therefore a very mild hydrogenation catalyst.24−26

The term electronic metal support interactions (EMSI) has
been
recently coined to describe the origin of excellent catalytic performance
which results as a consequence of the contact between highly dispersed
metal particles and reducible oxides, such as ceria.24−26 From this, the change of the chemical properties of metal sites
can be considered to be the result of perturbations in their electronic
properties due to bonding interactions with the support.24−26 The interaction of metal particles of subnanometer size down to
single atoms with an oxide carrier has been extensively described.
It was concluded, on the basis of the most conceptual aspects of the
EMSI effect,24−26 that as the size of the deposited particles increases,
the metallic character is recovered, whereas the effect of the support
is strongly attenuated.24−26 In that case, the modifications
induced by the support are limited to the interfacial atoms or the
perimeter of the particles.24−26 However, for metal nanoparticles,
a direct electronic modification of the deposited phase should be
considered as a result of the strong EMSI. Furthermore, the bonding
interactions between the metal and oxide can also modify the properties
of the oxide, generating new active sites. Thus, the properties of
both metal and oxide entities can be altered at the interface, resulting
in unique interfacial activities.21,24,26

Chemisorptive differences between copper and
traditional hydrogenation
catalysts have been well-documented and could possibly be responsible
for the selectivity and/or for the preference of copper catalysts
toward C=O hydrogenation.24 The
use of supported copper oxide catalysts in the hydrogenation of a
2 wt % octene and 10 wt % octanal mixture diluted in octanol was therefore
investigated in this study. The influence of various parameters such
as reaction temperature, pressure, hydrogen-to-aldehyde molar ratio,
and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) was investigated. The effectiveness
of these catalysts to preferentially hydrogenate the aldehyde over
the alkene was assessed and is discussed. Kinetic modeling of octanal
and octane hydrogenation is also reported.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
2.1.1 Powder X-ray Diffraction
Figure 1a–f displays
the diffraction patterns of the γ-alumina support and 5, 10,
15, 20, and 25 wt % supported Cu catalysts, respectively. The diffraction
patterns of the support material and the low copper loadings (≤10
wt %) show very broad humps characteristic of the low crystallinity
or amorphous γ-alumina material (JCPDS 10-425). No visible diffraction
lines due to CuO were observed. Similar observations have been reported
in the literature.27−29 One cannot, however, rule out the presence of the
CuO phase because it could be present as very small crystallites at
the detection limit of the instrument (<4 nm), which would render
the phase undetectable by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Sagar et al. confirm
this conclusion and state that CuO was present in a dispersed amorphous
state, at copper loadings less than 10 wt %.29 This was also supported by the high catalyst surface area measurements
from Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), which decreased as
Cu loading increased (Table 1). Youssef et al. also report the absence of peaks due to
the crystalline CuO phase in the XRD patterns of catalysts with ≤10
wt % Cu. They attributed this to well-dispersed amorphous CuO structures.30 The crystalline tenorite CuO phase (JCPDS 5-0661)
was observed in catalysts containing higher Cu loadings, and the intensities
of these reflections were found to increase with increasing copper
loading which agreed with the findings of Park and Ledford.31 The XRD patterns of all CAI catalysts after
temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and post catalytic testing
have been included in Figures S1 and S2. For 5 and 10 wt % after TPR, Cu could not be determined because
of the absence of the CuO and Cu0 reflections in the XRD
traces.32

which has undergone reduction at 220 °C, in a flow of hydrogen
(50 mL min–1) for 12 h.

b Used catalyst refers to that which
has undergone catalysis till 180 °C, hydrogen pressure of 50
bar, LHSV = 18 h—1, and H2-to-aldehyde
ratio of 1.5 mol.

2.1.2 In Situ XRD
Because for hydrogenation
reactions, the metallic copper constitutes the active catalyst phase,
whereas CuO is regarded as the catalyst precursor,26 it is important to understand the reaction between H2 and CuO. In situ XRD was therefore carried out on the calcined
CAI 25 catalyst, initially under a flow of hydrogen to investigate
the phase transformation from CuO to metallic Cu (Figure 2A).

Figure 2 (A) In situ XRD of calcined
CAI 25 in a hydrogen environment (reduction)
and (B) in situ XRD of reduced CAI 25 in an air environment (reoxidation).

The initial room temperature scan
showed the presence of tenorite
CuO peaks with characteristic d-spacing values of
2.75, 2.52, 2.32, and 1.86 Å between 30° and 50° 2θ,
as well as those for the amorphous alumina support. Upon increasing
the temperature, the disappearance of the CuO phase and introduction
of the metallic Cu phase (JCPDS 4-0836) between 220 and 240 °C
is observed. These include the characteristic d-spacing
values of 2.08, 1.80, and 1.28 Å between 40° and 80°
2θ. Beyond 240 °C, no further phase change is seen up to
320 °C. There was no evidence of an intermediate Cu+ species. Even upon cooling to 90 °C in the presence of hydrogen,
no phase change was observed. Reoxidation of this reduced catalyst
was thereafter carried out in the air (Figure 2B). Initially, the metallic Cu phase was
observed, but as the temperature was increased, a phase change to
cuprite Cu2O (JCPDS 5-0667) occurred between 240 and 260
°C. The CuO phase was observed once the sample was cooled to
room temperature. However, the complete reoxidation to CuO was not
observed after 2 h, and the presence of Cu+ and Cu0 was still evident at the end of the experiment. Similar findings
were made by Pacchioni, who found that temperatures as high as 600
°C were needed to yield purely the CuO phase.26 The CuO peaks after the experiment appear much broader
than those for the original calcined catalyst. This could possibly
be attributed to sintering of the metal and/or loss of crystallinity.

2.1.3 Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission
Spectroscopy
The copper content of each catalyst, as determined
by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES),
is shown in Table 1. An insignificant variation of the copper content in the fresh,
activated, and used catalyst indicated that no leaching of the active
metal species occurred during hydrogenation. This emphasizes the strong
interaction between the alumina support and the copper metal, evident
from TPR results (Table 2). The higher the temperature at which complete reduction occurs,
the stronger the interaction between CuO and the support. There is
no leaching of copper observed after the reduction of the catalysts
(Table 1).

2.1.4 Temperature Programmed Reduction
Table 2 shows the
temperatures at which reduction of CuO occurs, as well as the degree
of reducibility of the metal oxide present. As the metal loading increased,
an increase in the degree of reducibility from 51.0 to 87.8% was observed.
As can be seen by these values, there is still some unreduced CuO
present. For the 5 and 10 wt % catalysts, it is more likely that the
majority of CuO is reduced to Cu2O and only a small fraction
is reduced further to Cu0. Unfortunately, this could not
be confirmed by XRD because of the poor crystallinity, but this can
be seen from the calculated oxidation states.

In support of
this was the change in the catalyst color with copper loading (Table 1). The higher the
copper loading, the darker the catalyst, and bulk CuO was found to
be formed in the gray and black catalysts.32

For CAI 5, only one reduction peak was observed at 238 °C
and it could be assigned to amorphous bulk CuO or isolated Cu ions.29 This peak was observed to shift to 220 °C
(lower temperature region) for CAI 10. Here, the presence of highly
dispersed CuO particles was seen. Upon increasing the copper loading
further (≥15 wt %), two reduction peaks, namely, a and b were
observed in the TPR patterns (Figure 3). This suggests the presence of two copper species.
The area of b increases with copper loading, whereas that of a reaches
a maximum at 10 wt % Cu. Friedman et al. demonstrated that CuO/γ-Al2O3 catalysts reach saturated monolayer coverage
between 4 and 5 wt % Cu per 100 m2 g–1 of alumina.33 The gamma alumina used
in the present study has a surface area of 235 m2 g–1, so CuO monolayer saturation would occur above 10
wt % Cu. Above this loading, the formation of crystalline CuO is observed,
which is confirmed by the XRD results (Figure 1). Peak a occurs because of the reduction
of well-dispersed CuO.29,34 Highly dispersed Cu would provide
a larger reactive surface area for hydrogenation which, therefore,
would take place at a lower temperature. The second reduction peak,
b, however, is attributed to the bulk CuO present on the support.32 The intensity of peak b is found to increase
with copper loading and also broadens and shifts to higher reduction
temperatures. This could be attributed to the increase in CuO crystallinity.
The XRD of the reduced catalysts (Figure S2) showed the formation of metallic copper, indicating that Cu2+ was reduced to Cu0, which is the active phase
for hydrogenation.35 This observation could
only be made on catalysts with a copper content higher than 10 wt
% and is in agreement with the results obtained from the in situ XRD
in a reducing “hydrogen” environment.

2.1.5 Temperature
Programmed Desorption
γ-Alumina has an isoelectric
point of 7 and is therefore considered
amphoteric. Experimentally, the support used in this study was found
to possess surface acidity (Table 3) with the majority of the acid sites being strong
acid sites. From the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments,
all CAI catalysts exhibit weak (<250 °C), medium (250–400
°C), and strong acidic sites (>400 °C). There is a direct
correlation in the magnitudes of the weak and strong acidic sites
with respect to copper loadings. Auroux et al. found the monolayer
coverage to completely alter the surface of the support in terms of
hydroxyl density and acidity.36 As the
loading of CuO increased, a slight increase in total acidity was observed
up to 10 wt % Cu and then a decrease was seen with increasing Cu loading
(Table 3). A shift
to more medium strength acid sites was also observed with the introduction
of CuO. Camiloti and co-workers attributed the desorption of ammonia
at low temperatures to Lewis acid sites,37 which are essential to hydrogenation reactions because they behave
as electron-pair acceptors. The specific acidity of the catalysts
increased very slightly with copper loading. The absence of weak acid
sites and increased number of strong acid sites in the used catalyst
could be due to the presence of coke on the surface of the catalyst
after the reaction.

2.1.6 N2O Pulse Chemisorption
Youseff et al. highlighted
the importance of the metal surface area
and metal dispersion of supported metallic catalysts for their catalytic
performance.30 The metal surface area and
% dispersion was calculated as described in Section 2.2.2, and the results have been included
in Table 2. Here, an
increase in copper surface area and dispersion was observed to a maximum
of 66 m2 g–1 and 10.3% for CAI 10, respectively,
which is considered the saturation point for CuO monolayer formation.
Thereafter, a decrease in the copper surface area and dispersion was
observed because of the formation of CuO crystallites. Average Cu
crystallite size was seen to increase with copper loading. With regards
to the amount of N2O chemisorbed on the catalyst surface
(Table 2), the catalysts
used in this study can be ranked as follows: CAI 10 > CAI 15 >
CAI
25 > CAI 20 > CAI 5. The dispersion of copper is decreased and
with
increase in the copper loading. The crystallite size of copper is
increased with increase in copper loading. With decrease in the metal
dispersion, the shift of medium acidic sites to strong acidic sites
suggests that because of the large crystallites of copper, the coverage
of alumina surface with copper is decreased and thus increased the
number of strong acidic sites of the catalyst.

2.1.7 Physisorption
Table 1 includes the BET surface areas
and pore volumes of the γ-Al2O3 support
and catalysts. The general trend observed is that a decrease in both
surface area and pore volume occurs with an increase in Cu loading.
Similar observations were reported by Dow and co-workers.34 The decrease in both surface area and pore volume
can be attributed to CuO particles occupying space on the surface
and in the support micropores.38 Unsupported
CuO has a much lower surface area than the high surface area alumina
support used. The decrease in the catalyst surface area and pore volume
which occurred in used catalysts can be attributed to clogging of
the pores with the feed and product molecules, whose presence was
confirmed by infra-red (IR) analysis. The activated catalysts showed
higher surface area when compared to the fresh catalyst, which indicates
that there would be some agglomeration of Cu particles after reduction,
which increases the surface area of the catalysts.

The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms for the support and all
catalysts (Figure S3A) can be classified
as type IV30 and are typical for the mesoporous
material.39 These catalysts show the H1-type
hysteresis loop which is usually associated with porous materials
with well-defined cylindrical-like pore channels or uniform sphere
agglomerates. As Cu loading increases, however, there is a change
in the hysteresis shape toward type H4, which implies materials with
narrow slit pores, including those in the micropore region.39 The activated catalysts showed a similar pattern
in the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms. It is observed
that as the metal loading increases, the average pore widths of the
catalysts decrease (Figure S3B). These
results complement the BET pore volume results, which show a decrease
in pore volume as the metal loading increases. This confirms the “plugging”
effect of CuO particles. This is most likely to occur because of clogging
of the pores by the metal oxide. Once again the data confirm that
the catalysts are mesoporous because their internal width lies between
2 and 50 nm. After reduction, there is no drastic change in the pore
size distributions of the catalysts.

2.1.8 Infra-red
Analysis
The IR spectra
for all catalysts were similar (Table S1). No real distinction between CuO and support could be made for
fresh or used catalysts because of the overlapping of peaks in the
400–800 cm–1 region. CuO exhibits characteristic
stretching between 400 and 600 cm–1 and those representing
the ionic character of the Al–O bond of γ-Al2O3 occur at around 500 and 818 cm–1.40,41 A shift of the bands from 818 to 795 cm–1 and
491 to 528 cm–1 was observed with the introduction
of CuO onto the alumina support. A shift closer to the initial values
was observed with an increase of the copper loading. The used catalysts
showed more interesting spectra and are discussed here. Strong, broad
bands between 3200 and 3500 cm–1 indicate the presence
of hydrogen-bound O–H stretching, and these were observed for
all used catalysts. The stretching vibration of the alcohol C–O
functional group occurs around 1057 cm–1 but is
only seen on CAI 20 and not on the other catalysts, indicating efficient
desorption of the octanol product from the catalyst surface. Strong
peaks between 2900 and 2800 cm–1 occur because of
the presence of methylene CH2 groups and are characteristic
of C–H aliphatic stretching of alkanes.42 The scissoring peak observed around 1410 cm–1 is characteristic of the C–H bending of alkanes. Both these
peaks suggest the presence of octane on the catalyst surface, which
was confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry after
washing off the products from the catalyst surface with acetone. For
all catalysts, alkene stretching and bending vibrations between 1620
and 1680 cm–1 are absent. The C=O bands representing
aldehydes between 2830 and 2695 cm–1 are also not
present.

2.1.9 Electron Microscopy
The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the fresh catalysts (Figure S4) show a rough surface morphology for
all copper loadings. The particle shapes and sizes are irregular.
As copper content increases (>15 wt %), the formation of larger
and
longer particles is observed. This could be due to the agglomeration
of CuO particles and the formation of “bulk” CuO which
is in agreement with the TPR results. For the catalysts containing
20 and 25 wt % Cu, more platelike, rigid structures are observed,
which could result in increased crystallinity. This observation is
confirmed by results obtained from TPR. Upon reduction, a change to
a smoother surface morphology was observed. The rigid, platelike agglomeration
of metallic Cu is seen. The used catalysts appear very similar to
the activated ones, although very small holes in the catalyst surface
can be seen. Figure 4 displays the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs
of the catalysts. They show both irregularly shaped and rodlike structures.
As the copper loading increases, the rodlike particles appear more
defined in shape and are longer. The rods can therefore be attributed
to CuO and the smaller particles to the alumina support.

2.2 Catalytic Testing
The primary product
formed from the hydrogenation of octanal is octanol, whereas that
for octene is octane. This investigation was undertaken to determine
whether the copper catalysts would preferentially hydrogenate octanal
in a mixture with octene and to determine the effect of copper loading
on the reaction system. For simplicity, the conversion of reactants
was based on the moles of either octanal or octene fed, compared to
the moles of unreacted feed leaving the reactor. It was also assumed
that octene formed octane, whereas numerous side reactions were considered
for the octanal hydrogenation.

Octanol was used as a diluent
because there is a large exotherm associated with the hydrogenation
of octanal which was therefore kept at 10 wt %. Octanol was also considered
to have no significant effect on the reaction because it is the product
of octanal hydrogenation. If the octanol diluent had any effect, according
to the Le Chateliers principle, one would see a drop in aldehyde conversion,
which was not seen in this study. A much smaller quantity of octene
(2 wt %) was used because it represents a byproduct. Figure 5A shows the variation of octanal
conversion with temperature for supported Cu catalysts with various
loadings. These reactions were all carried out at a pressure of 50
bar, LHSV of 18 h–1, and hydrogen-to-aldehyde molar
ratio of 1.5. For all copper loadings, the octanal conversion increased
as the reaction temperature increased and reached a plateau at 160
°C. At 100 °C, CAI 10 showed the highest catalytic activity
(53%) and CAI 5 the lowest (35%) with regards to octanal conversion.
This could possibly be linked to the high metallic surface area associated
with CAI 10 (66 m2 g–1) determined by
N2O pulse chemisorption. The activity of CAI 15 and CAI
25 was very similar (46 and 47%, respectively), with CAI 20 showing
a similar activity as CAI 5 (38%). The same trend was observed when
the temperature was increased to 120 °C, whereas at 140 °C,
conversions for all catalysts were relatively constant between 97
and 98%. Above 140 °C, conversions of >99% were obtained for
all catalysts. In contrast, Nagaraja et al., reported variation in
furfural conversion with copper loading in the vapor phase at 180 °C.43

Figure 5 Effect of reaction temperature on (A) the conversion of
octanal,
(B) the conversion of octene, and (C) the hydrogen conversion using
CAI catalysts with varying copper loadings. All reactions were carried
out between 100 and 180 °C at a pressure of 50 bar and hydrogen-to-aldehyde
molar ratio of 1.5.

The relative catalyst
activities at low temperatures can also be
attributed to the number of medium acid sites of each catalyst (Table 3). CAI 10 contains
the most medium acid sites, whereas CAI 5 contains the least and hence
a significant difference in activity is observed. CAI 15 and CAI 25
contain a similar number of medium acid sites. These sites can be
considered as Lewis acid sites and hence are electron-pair acceptors.
For this reason, catalysts with more Lewis acid sites facilitate the
hydrogenation of octanal to octanol, and the trend was also observed
with the amount of N2O adsorbed onto the catalyst surface
(Table 2). The octene
conversion (Figure 5B) followed a similar trend with temperature, although no plateau
was reached up to a reaction temperature of 180 °C. The thermodynamic
equilibrium constant for octanal hydrogenation (3.12 × 1012) is higher than that for octene hydrogenation (1.28 ×
1011). Thus, copper clearly preferentially hydrogenated
octanal over octene.

The relative reactivity of C=O and
C=C bonds could
be dependent on the adsorption of these groups onto the active Cu
site. The low heats of adsorption of simple gases (CO, H2, and N2O) on copper (<10 kcal mol–1) suggest dipole interactions rather than covalent bond formation.
The higher polarization of the C=O bond (C+–O–) could explain the high chemisorption rates of carbonyl
groups and hence the higher reactivity. Steric effects hindering the
approach of the functional group toward the catalyst active site on
the surface in liquid reactions are expected and well-known for olefins
(Lebedev’s rule). Figure 5C shows the hydrogen conversion during the reactions.
The d-electrons in copper are readily thermally excited to sp-states
which could potentially lead to unpaired electrons in the d-band.25 This would facilitate stronger and more efficient
hydrogen adsorption at higher temperatures, which is observed from
the increase in conversion. The data obtained confirm that all reactions
took place in a hydrogen-rich environment and hydrogen conversion
follows the same trend as the catalyst activities.

2.2.1 Product
Selectivity over Cu/Al2O3 Catalysts
During the catalytic hydrogenation
of octanal, a number of possible reactions could occur. The main,
desired reaction is the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to yield
octanol. The selectivity toward octanol for each catalyst is shown
in Figure 6. A maximum
octanol selectivity of 98% was obtained for CAI 10 at 100 °C.
A steady decrease in the selectivity to octanol with increasing temperature
is observed, reaching 93% at 180 °C. This small decrease in selectivity
to octanol (5%) indicates that these catalysts specifically direct
the primary reaction toward the formation of the alcohol. Metal loading
had no significant effect on the selectivity toward octanol.

Figure 6 Effect of temperature
on the selectivity toward octanol using CAI
catalysts with varying copper loadings.

The major side reactions that could occur include aldol condensation
of two octanal molecules to yield the C16 aldol, as shown in Scheme 1. This reaction can
be catalyzed both by an acid and a base and catalysts supported on
amphoteric alumina can promote the reaction.44 The C16 diol can then be dehydrated to a C16 α,β-unsaturated
aldehyde, which upon further hydrogenation yields the saturated 2-hexyldecanol
(Scheme 2).45−48 The other major side reaction involves the reaction between an octanal
and octanol molecule over acidic sites, which results in a C16 hemiacetal
intermediate. Upon dehydration and reaction with another octanol molecule,
one sees the formation of the C24 acetal. This product could then
undergo cracking to form dioctyl ether and alcohols (Scheme 3). Alternately, the C16 hemiacetal
could undergo dehydrogenation and produce octyl octanoate. The C16
diol was by far the major byproduct formed, followed by the C24 acetal.
At higher temperatures, an increase in selectivity to 2-hexyl decanol
was observed, possibly due to the increased activity of Brønsted
acid sites. This observation confirms that the alumina support does
facilitate the aldol condensation reaction.

2.2.2 Product
Selectivity at Isoconversion
The byproduct selectivity of
the catalysts obtained at isoconversion
of 97% (140 °C) is summarized in Figure S5. A similar product profile was obtained for all copper loadings.
The major byproduct observed was the aldol condensation product termed
the C16 diol. The selectivity to the C16 diol increased slightly with
copper loading until 20 wt %; thereafter, a slight decrease was observed.
The increase in the C16 diol selectivity is in correlation with the
decrease in the metal dispersion of copper. Decrease in the metal
dispersion facilitates the feed to contact with the Bronsted acidic
site of the alumina support, which increases the aldol condensation.
The CAI 25 catalyst promoted the formation of a C24 acetal and alcohol
byproducts. This could possibly be attributed to the presence of more
Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface (Table 3).

2.2.3 Time
on Stream
A time on stream
experiment was carried out with the CAI 5 catalyst to determine the
stability of the catalysts. A temperature of 140 °C, LHSV of
18 h–1, hydrogen-to-aldehyde molar ratio of 1.5,
and pressure of 50 bar was used for the reaction. The results (Figure S6) show that the catalyst was stable
over the duration the experiment (30 h).

2.2.4 Effect
of LHSV
Figure 7 shows the results obtained
for CAI 5 with variation of the space velocity at 140 °C, a hydrogen-to-aldehyde
molar ratio of 1.5, and a pressure of 50 bar. As expected, both the
conversion of octanal and octene decrease with an increase in LHSV.
A slight increase in selectivity to octanol was observed with an increase
in LHSV. The results also show that a significant rise in octene conversion
occurs only after maximum octanal conversion is realized. This observation
implies that the C=O groups adsorb preferentially to the active
sites of the catalyst.

of octanal
and octene using CAI 5 at a temperature of 140 °C, hydrogen-to-aldehyde
molar ratio of 1.5, and pressure of 50 bar.

2.2.5 Kinetic Modeling of Octanal and Octene Hydrogenation
Octanal and octene were cofed to the packed-bed reactor (PBR) containing
the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst particles. For each experiment,
0.7651 g of catalyst was used, over which the liquid mixture, containing
octanal and octene in octanol was fed. Hydrogen gas was cofed such
that the molar ratios between the substrates and the hydrogen were
maintained. The molar feed ratios of octanal/octene/hydrogen were
kept constant at 1:0.221:1.5.

The residence time in the reactor
was varied by varying the octanal feed rate from 0.0064 to 0.63 mol
h–1, giving space times of 0.075–0.0.0076
gcat h mL–1, where the space time (τ)
for the PBR is defined as for heterogeneous systems20,21  where mcat is
the catalyst mass in the reactor and υ is the volumetric flow
rate. The simultaneous conversion of both octanal and octene, given
in Table S2, was calculated for each space
time. In the table, Al represents the aldehyde, octanal and ENE the
octene.

There are certain assumptions that may be made when
developing
the reaction model for this process. First, it has previously been
shown that the interaction of the octanal with the active sites on
the catalyst is significantly stronger than the interaction of the
octane.49 As a result of the dominance
of the octanal absorption, octene does not react when any significant
amounts of the aldehyde are present in the reactor. This is confirmed
by the measured data (Table S2) where it
is seen that the octene conversion is very low until the conversion
of octanal has reached a significant level. The reaction rate equation
that best fits the data will depend on whether or not there are significant
mass transfer limitations in the system, specifically the mass transfer
of hydrogen from the gas phase to the liquid phase. In the presence
of mass-transfer limitations, the observed rate becomes essentially
the rate of mass transfer which is first order in the hydrogen partial
pressure.50 Similarly, if the rate-limiting
step is the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface,
the rate expression becomes first order in the hydrogen concentration.

This is in agreement with findings of various other authors.50−52 However, in similar reaction systems, where it could be assumed
that the adsorbed hydrogen was essentially at equilibrium and that
the rate-determining step was the addition of the second hydrogen
atom to the organic molecule, the rate expression was determined to
be first order in both the hydrogen partial pressure and the organic
concentration.50

For the system employed
in this study, the high hydrogen partial
pressure (50 atm) means that the liquid concentration of hydrogen
will be constant and therefore gas to liquid mass transfer of the
hydrogen will not control the rate. Additionally, this, together with
the fact that excess hydrogen is fed to the reactor, makes it likely
that the hydrogen concentration on the catalyst surface is maintained
at a constant value. This is in agreement with previous studies on
similar systems.51−54

It may be expected that the high hydrogen partial pressure
and
the consequently resulting high dissolved hydrogen concentration may
inhibit the reaction by blocking the access of the organic substrate
to the catalytic active sites. However, if it is accepted that the
reaction mechanism occurs via a dual-site mechanism, as proposed in
the literature,51 then hydrogen will not
inhibit the reaction.

Combing these assumptions that the reaction
occurs via a dual-site
mechanism with addition of the second hydrogen atom to the substrate
as the rate-controlling step, that gas to liquid mass transfer is
not limiting, and that, therefore, the adsorbed hydrogen is constant,
the rate expression will take the form  where i is the substrate
(octanal or octene), k is the lumped rate constant
for i, and θi is
the fraction of vacant sites which are available for the adsorption
of the substrate i. In the case of octanal, which
adsorbs preferentially on the surface, this rate expression may be
simplified to a first-order rate equation  where CAl,0 is
the feed concentration of octanal, that is, 0.00063 mol cm3 and XAl is the conversion of octanal.

Given that octene is excluded to a large extent from the surface
by octanal, the reaction of octene does not occur until octanal has
undergone significant conversion, as can be seen in Figure 7. The number of active Cu sites
available for octene adsorption depends on the number of sites occupied
by octanal. The concentration of unreacted octene in the fluid phase
is related to the initial octanal concentration and the octanal conversion.
The adsorbed octene concentration, in turn, depends on this fluid
phase concentration. Although it is recognized that these relationships
are nonlinear, as a first approximation of the total relationship,
it is assumed that the fraction of vacant sites available for octene
adsorption may be related to the octanal conversion. Given these constraints,
the rate equation for the octene becomes  

As octanal absorbs preferentially on the catalyst,
the sites available
for octene absorption are limited by the presence of unreacted octanal.
Expressed mathematically, the fraction of sites available for octene,
assuming that the rate of adsorption is fast enough to limit the number
of vacant sites, is  

The fraction
of the surface of the catalyst covered by octanal
will depend, via the adsorption equilibrium, on the concentration
of octanal in the fluid phase  and following from above, when XAl = 0, θAl = 1 so k′CAl,0 = 1.  

From the rate model  

To determine
whether this proposed model fits the measured data
and to determine the values of the two lumped constants, the values
of the constants in the rate expression were optimized using multidimensional
unconstrained nonlinear minimization (Nelder–Mead) in MATLAB
while solving the differential equation using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta
method. In each case, a standard mole balance was used to predict
the change in conversion with space time  

The results of fitting the
model to the measured data are shown
in Figure 8. It can
be seen that the measured data are well-represented by the models
proposed. The values of the rate constants are kAl = 141 cm3 (g·h)−1 and kENE = 9.5 cm3 (g·h)−1. When compared to the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes, such as citral and crotonaldehyde, octanal hydrogenation
showed a lower rate constant.50−52 This shows that the hydrogenation
of octene is inherently slower than the hydrogenation of octanal.
In attempting to fit alternative kinetic models,50−52 particularly
where rate equations were first order in both hydrogen and the substrate
or where the reaction was negative order in the substrate, it was
found that none of these alternatives fitted the data as well as the
reaction first order in the substrate alone.

Figure 8 Model fit for the conversion
of octanal and octene vs space time.

2.2.6 Effect of Hydrogen-to-Aldehyde Molar Ratio
Figure 9A shows
the conversion of octanal, and Figure 9B shows the conversion of octene with respect to the
hydrogen-to-aldehyde molar ratio and reaction temperature for CAI
5, at a constant pressure of 50 bar. No significant change in conversion
is observed for the hydrogen-to-aldehyde molar ratio of 0.5 across
the temperature range. For ratios of 1 and 1.5, however, a significant
effect was observed. An increase in the conversion of both reactants
was seen with an increase of both the hydrogen-to-aldehyde ratio and
the temperature. The highest selectivity toward octanol is observed
at a ratio of 1. Hydrogen deficiency at ratios smaller than 1 would
result in self-condensation of the unreacted molecules remaining adsorbed
on the catalyst surface55,56 to yield byproducts
such as the C16 aldol, the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, the
C16 diol, and the C24 acetal. These bulky products could block the
active catalyst sites and hinder the hydrogenation reaction. At higher
ratios, the excess hydrogen would favor further hydrogenation of the
α,β-unsaturated aldehyde to 2-hexyl decanol, as shown
in Scheme 2, and of
the C16 aldol to the C16 diol.

Figure 9 Effect of hydrogen-to-aldehyde molar ratio
on (A) octanal conversion
and (B) octene conversion at a temperature of 140 °C, pressure
of 50 bar, and LHSV of 18 h–1 with CAI 5.

2.2.7 Effect
of Pressure
The effect of
pressure on octanal conversion, octene conversion, and selectivity
to octanol and byproducts was investigated using the CAI 5 catalyst
between 120 and 160 °C. The results obtained are summarized in Figure 10A–C. With
regards to octanal conversion, pressure appears to have no significant
effect, unlike the temperature, which shows an increasing trend. This
indicates that no gas to liquid mass-transfer problems existed within
the system. Similar findings with regards to the effect of pressure
on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol have been made.57 Reaction pressure did, however, seem to have an influence
on the octene conversion. Above 120 °C, a proportional rise in
octene conversion was observed with pressure and reaction temperature.
No significant effect was observed on the selectivity toward octanol
with increasing pressure.

Figure 10 Effect of pressure on (A) octanal conversion,
(B) octene conversion,
and (C) octanol selectivity. Reactions were all undertaken between
20 and 50 bar pressure at a temperature of 140 °C, hydrogen-to-aldehyde
molar ratio of 1.5, and LHSV of 18 h–1 with CAI
5.

3 Conclusions
Cu preferentially hydrogenated octanal over octene in a mixture
consisting of 10 wt % octanal and 2 wt % octene in octanol between
120 and 180 °C. Preferential hydrogenation can also, therefore,
take place in a mixed feed, whereas all previous reports were on the
selective hydrogenation of functional groups within α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes. The copper content, however, had no impact on the conversion
of either feed or selectivity toward octanol at temperatures greater
than 120 °C, unlike in α,β-unsaturated aldehyde systems.
The catalyst activity was found to be dependent on the number of sites
of medium acid strength present, whereas surface area and pore volume
had no significant effect. It was also seen that temperature directly
influenced the conversion of both octanal and octene. An increase
in conversion was observed with increasing temperature, although this
resulted in a decrease in selectivity toward octanol. The major byproduct
formed was the C16 diol, which resulted from the aldol condensation
between two octanal molecules. An increase in LHSV resulted in a decrease
in octanal and octene conversion with a consequent increase in selectivity
toward octanol. Kinetic modeling showed that both the hydrogenation
of octanal and octene was first-order reactions. A significant rise
in octene conversion occurred only after maximum octanal conversion
was realized, and this observation implied that the C=O groups
adsorb preferentially to the active sites of the catalyst. The hydrogen-to-aldehyde
molar ratio influenced the conversion of both reactants and the selectivity
toward octanol. A stoichiometric amount was deemed necessary for high
conversions with a 50% excess resulting in maximum conversion. The
pressure at which the reaction was carried out was found to have no
significant effect on octanal conversion or selectivity toward octanol,
which indicated that no gas-to-liquid mass transfer problems existed
in the system. A decrease in pressure, however, was found to disfavor
octene conversion.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
Cu/Al2O3 catalysts with varying copper loading of 5, 10, 15,
20, and 25 wt % were prepared by wet impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with aqueous solutions of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98–103%).58 From here on, the catalysts will be referred
to as CAI 5–CAI 25, with the number denoting the copper wt
% loading. The γ-Al2O3 catalyst support
(Alfa Aesar) was finely ground prior to impregnation. The mixtures
were allowed to stir for 6 h, after which the water was evaporated
with stirring. The catalysts were then oven-dried at 110 °C,
followed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 8 h. A temperature
ramp of 1.6 °C min–1 was used for calcination.
The feed used for all catalytic work was prepared as 10 wt % octanal
and 2 wt % octene with octanol as a diluent. All solvents were obtained
from Sasol.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
The weight
percentage of copper loading of all catalysts was determined by ICP–OES
using PerkinElmer Precisely Optical Emission Spectrometer Optima 5300
DV. Prior to analysis, the catalyst samples were digested with concentrated
nitric acid. The standards were prepared from a 1000 ppm ICP standard
(Polychem).

Powder XRD was carried out using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE
XRD diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406
Å). The samples were analyzed as fine powders. The diffractometer
operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scanning rate of 0.5° min–1 slit (in 2θ) and divergence slit and scatter
slit widths of 1°. The data obtained from powder XRD were used
to calculate the mean crystallite size of the catalyst using the Scherrer
equation.59 The Scherrer constant (k) for the instrument was 0.98. In situ XRD during hydrogenation
was carried out with 5% H2 in N2 at a flow rate
of 30 mL min–1. The temperature was ramped at a
rate of 1 °C min–1 till 350 °C and thereafter
was cooled to 100 °C at the same rate. The reoxidation was thereafter
carried out by initially flowing N2 for 2 h at 100 °C
to purge any H2 present. Thereafter, air was used at a
flow rate of 30 mL min–1 and a temperature ramp
of 1 °C min–1 until 350 °C.

IR spectra
were recorded using PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR fitted
with a Universal ATR Sampling Accessory equipped with a diamond crystal.
The powdered sample was placed on the crystal and a force (120 gauge)
was applied to ensure proper contact between the sample and the crystal.

H2 TPR, NH3 TPD, and N2O pulse
chemisorption were carried out with a Micromeritics 2920 AutoChem
II Chemisorption Analyzer. For both H2 TPR and NH3 TPD, the catalyst sample was placed on quartz wool located in a
U-shaped quartz tube. Prior to both analyses, the samples were pretreated
with argon flowing at a rate of 30 mL min–1 until
350 °C at a rate of 20 °C min–1. For H2 TPR, the pretreated sample was then subjected to 5% H2 in argon flowing at a rate of 30 mL min–1, whereas the temperature was linearly increased from 90 to 600 °C
at a rate of 10 °C min–1. The hydrogen consumption
was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The amount
of hydrogen consumed was used to determine the degree of reducibility
and oxidation state for each catalyst.

For NH3 TPD,
the pretreated sample was reduced with
5% H2 in argon and thereafter treated with helium for 1
h to remove excess hydrogen. NH3 (4.1%) in the helium gas
mixture was then passed through the system and allowed to adsorb onto
the surface of the catalyst for 30 min. Helium gas was then passed
through at a flow rate of 30 mL min–1, whereas the
temperature was linearly increased from 100 to 1000 °C at a rate
of 10 °C min–1. The amount of ammonia desorbed
was monitored using a TCD.

A Cu metal surface was evaluated
by a novel technique combining
TPR measurement with N2O oxidation. The technique consists
of three steps: the usual TPR measurement; the oxidation of the Cu
surface by N2O; and the subsequent TPR measurement. The
surface Cu oxidized by N2O was determined as a ratio of
the peak area of the second TPR profile to that of the first one.
It was found that bulk oxidation gradually proceeds after surface
oxidation even at 30 °C. After the surface oxidation, Cu2O produced by N2O oxidation varied with N2O exposure time (t) and had a linear correlation
with t1/2 at temperatures below 100 °C.
The linear correlation in the parabolic plot proves that bulk oxidation
proceeds through the diffusion process and the Y intercept
corresponds to the surface oxidation. Both the dispersion and the
Cu metal surface area of the sample were calculated from the intercept
in the parabolic plot for Cu2O produced by N2O oxidation. For the N2O pulse chemisorption, the pretreated
sample was reduced with 5% H2 in argon and thereafter flushed
with helium to remove excess hydrogen. N2O (10%) in the
helium mixture was pulsed over the catalyst sample at a temperature
of 80 °C to obtain peak saturation with time. The amount of N2 produced was quantified using a TCD. The saturated peaks
were used to estimate the amount of N2O chemisorbed on
the surface of the catalyst (VT). Nitrogen
produced by each injection is described by the equation  

The stoichiometry
factor Fs relating
the moles of copper reacting per mole of nitrogen produced is therefore
2. It is thereafter assumed that the nitrogen produced behaves as
an ideal gas under analysis conditions and occupies 22 414
cm3 (STP) mol–1. This constant is termed
the molar gas volume, V0. The number of
molecules of copper is given by the Avogadro’s constant NA (6.022 × 1023), and the atomic
cross section of copper ACu was taken
to be 6.80 × 10–20 m2 atom–1. The specific surface area SACu in m2 gCu–1 is therefore calculated as follows60  

The percent copper dispersion,
% DCu, was calculated using VT, Fs, and Vo (defined previously).
The molar mass of copper, Mo,Cu, was taken
as 63.54 g mol–1, whereas the mass percent of copper
present in the sample % MCu was determined
by ICP–OES. The metal dispersion is therefore calculated as
follows60  

The average copper particle
size (φav) can also
be calculated using the following equation8,29  where SACu is the copper metal
surface area and ρCu is the density of copper (8.92
g cm–3).

The specific surface area and pore
volumes of the catalysts were
determined by BET nitrogen physisorption analysis using a Micromeritics
Gemini instrument. Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed overnight
at 200 °C under nitrogen flow using Micromeritics FlowPrep 060.
The degassed samples were cooled to room temperature before further
analysis.

N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms,
as well as pore
size distribution data were obtained using Micromeritics ASAP 2020.
The samples were also degassed at 200 °C overnight prior to analysis.

The SEM analysis was carried out on Zeiss Ultra plus field emission
SEM with a secondary electron detector and was analyzed with Smart
SEM software. Prior to analysis, the samples were mounted on aluminum
stubs with double-sided carbon tape. These samples were coated with
gold by a Polaron E5100 coating unit. Energy-dispersive spectrometry
was carried out using a JEOL JSM-6100 scanning microscope fitted with
a Bruker EDX detector and was analyzed using Esprit 1.8 software.
These samples were carbon-coated using a JEOL JEE-4C vacuum evaporator
prior to analysis.

Cyro-TEM images of the various supported
copper oxide catalysts
were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1010 electron microscope. The images
were captured using ITEM software. Sample preparation involved suspension
of the catalyst in an acetone/water mixture, after which it was placed
on a formvar-coated copper grid.

4.3 Catalytic
Testing
Gas/liquid mixed
phase reactions were carried out over a solid catalyst in a continuous
(plug) flow fixed-bed reactor operated in a down flow mode. The reactor
tube was grade 316 stainless steel with an internal diameter of 14
mm and a length of 265 mm. The catalyst pellet sizes ranged between
300 and 600 μm. A catalyst volume of 3 mL (ca. 1.2 g) was diluted
with an equal volume of 24 grit carborundum. The mixture was packed
between two layers of glass wool in the isothermal zone of the tube.
The remainder to the tube was packed with carborundum, with glass
wool lining at the two ends of the reactor tube. Once packed, the
reactor tube was fitted into a solid stainless steel block. The tube
was secured by bolts, which were torqued using a torque wrench. An
electrically heated jacket, equipped with a temperature controller
and a thermocouple, was used to heat the reactor tube. The temperature
of the catalyst bed was monitored with a coaxially centered sliding
thermocouple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed. The complete
setup was pressure-tested for leaks prior to the startup of the reactor.
The composition of the feed used for all reactions consisted of 2
wt % octene and 10 wt % octanal diluted with octanol. The feed entered
the reactor via a LabAlliance Series II isocratic pump. The liquid
products formed were collected in a 500 mL catchpot and the excess
hydrogen gas exited through a Ritter Drum-Type (TG1-model 5) wet gas
flow meter. The pressure within the system was maintained by a Tescom
back pressure regulator positioned before the sampling point. Prior
to each experiment, the catalyst underwent activation in a nitrogen
atmosphere at 200 °C for 4 h and reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere
at 220 °C overnight. The gas flow rate was regulated by calibrated
nitrogen and hydrogen Brooks flow meters. The mass balance for all
samples was 100 ± 1%. The liquid products obtained were collected
at regular intervals and were analyzed on PerkinElmer Clarus 500 GC
equipped with a flame ionization detector using a Petrolite column.
All data points were obtained in duplicate within an error of ±2%.
