The effect of organic cation doping with aziridinium
(Az+) on the material properties of CsPbI3 was
investigated
by applying first-principles calculations. The results showed that
the phase stability is greatly improved by incorporating the organic
cation Az+ at the A site of CsPbI3. However,
the band gap of CsPbI3 is further enlarged from 1.76 to
2.27 eV when 12.5% of Az doping is used. The optical absorption coefficient
of Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 is also decreased
in the visible light region. The reasons of the improved phase stability
and the enlargement of band gap arising from the organic cation doping
are revealed. Our calculated results can provide theoretical guidance
for improving the phase stability of halide perovskites.

Introduction
Lead halide perovskites have attracted
extensive attention as promising
photovoltaic candidates for solar cell applications during the past
10 years. The reason that makes halide perovskites suitable for photovoltaic
applications is their excellent optoelectronic properties, such as
tunable band gaps, high absorption coefficients, small effective masses,
high carrier mobility, and long electron–hole diffusion length.1−4 Since their first successful implementation in dye-sensitized solar
cells in 2009,5 the power conversion efficiencies
(PCE) have rapidly increased from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.2% in 2019.6 Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) are the most
promising photovoltaic materials.7,8 However, in
view of the nature of the organic cations, the structural stability
of hybrid perovskites is usually poor,9 which is the main factor for hindering commercial applications.
An alternative approach to solve this issue is the replacement of
these organic cations with an inorganic Cs cation for developing all-inorganic
halide perovskites.10 The cubic phase of
CsPbI3 possesses a direct band gap of 1.73 eV,11,12 making it a promising photovoltaic material. However, the cubic
phase can only be stable at temperatures over 300 °C, and it
can easily convert to an undesirable nonperovskite δ-phase at
room temperature.13

Great efforts
have been made to improve the stability of CsPbI3. Partial
substitution of the iodine ion with the smaller
bromine ion has been proven to be a feasible method for improving
the phase stability.14 However, the incorporation
of Br can lead to an increase in the band gap of CsPbI3, which is undesirable for solar cell applications.15 Our previous study has indicated that the band gap of CsPbI3 can be effectively tuned from 1.03 to 2.14 eV by applying
strain.16 Recently, the phase stability
of the CsPbI3 perovskite can be significantly improved
via organic cation doping.17 The results
suggested that dimethylammonium cation (DMA+) is a more
efficient dopant in stabilizing CsPbI3 than ethylammonium
(EA+) and guanidinium (GA+).17 A moderate amount of DMA+ can substitute partial
Cs+ of CsPbI3, forming the double-cation Cs1–xDMAxPbI3.18 The calculated results
have revealed that 12.5% of Cs doping can slightly enhance the optical
absorption of MAPbI3, which makes it a possible candidate
for highly efficient perovskite solar cells.19 A three-membered cyclic organic cation-based lead halide perovskite
(CH2)2NH2PbI3 was proposed
to be a potential absorber material for photovoltaics due to its good
stability and lower band gap.20 The ionic
radius of aziridinium ((CH2)2NH2,
Az) is between those of MA and FA.20 The
previous calculated results further suggested that substitution of
the Az cation at the A site can enhance the stability of the MA1–xAzxPbI3 perovskite and tune the band gap.21 Therefore, it is important to investigate whether Az doping can
increase the stability of CsPbI3, and the effect of Az
cation on the structural stability and electronic and optical properties
of the CsPbI3 perovskite needs to be further explored for
evaluating the photovoltaic performance.

In this work, the effect
of cation replacement with Az on the properties
of CsPbI3 was investigated by applying first-principles
calculations. The results show that Az doping can apparently improve
the phase stability of CsPbI3. The results indicate that
the structural distortion of CsPbI3 arising from Az doping
is the main factor for the enhanced phase stability. At 12.5% dopant
content, CsPbI3 exhibits an apparently blue-shifted band
gap from 1.76 to 2.27 eV and reduced the optical absorption in the
visible light region.

Results and Discussion
The CsPbI3 perovskite
is a cubic structure with space
group Fm3̅m at high temperatures.13 The calculated lattice parameter of CsPbI3 is 6.26 Å, which agrees with the experimental value
(6.29 Å).13 Therefore, the optB86b-vdW
functional can give an accurate lattice parameter for CsPbI3. In order to obtain 12.5% of Az doping, a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell
containing eight formula units of CsPbI3 was used, and
one Cs+ ion was replaced by Az+, as shown in Figure 1. Az has a larger
ionic radius than Cs; the substitution of Cs by Az should lead to
the expansion of the volume. Interestingly, the volume contraction
is observed when Cs is replaced by Az, as listed in Table 1. Moreover, the Pb–I
bonds become longer in the Az-doped CsPbI3, but the Pb–I–Pb
angles are found to get smaller. A previous study17 has showed that octahedral rotation distortion can reduce
the extra space around the Cs cation, and it also explains the reason
why the Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 perovskite
has a smaller cell volume with respect to the pure CsPbI3. In addition, the Coulomb interactions between the Cs cation and
the inorganic framework PbI6 are increased, which is beneficial
for the improved phase stability of CsPbI3.

The structural stability of halide perovskites can
be assessed
by the Goldschmidt’s tolerance factor t(22) 1  where RA is the
A-site cation radius, RB is the B-site
cation radius, and RX is the X-site anion
radius. The perovskite structure is stable when the tolerance factor
is in the range of 0.81–1.11.23 For
CsPbI3, the tolerance factor is 0.81, which approaches
the lower limit of the requirement. The result also indicates that
the phase stability of CsPbI3 is poor. Given that the tolerance
factor of CsPbI3 is on the margin of the stable perovskite
structure, increasing the tolerance factor of CsPbI3 is
an effective method to improve its phase stability. The ionic radius
of Az+ is 2.27 Å,20 which
is larger than that of Cs+. The tolerance factor of Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 is 0.82, which is conducive
to improve the phase stability. In addition, the octahedral factor
μ (RB/RX)24 is another important parameter to
predict the structural stability of halide perovskites. The value
of the octahedral factor μ is 0.54 for pure and Az-doped CsPbI3, which locates in the range of 0.44–0.90.24

In light of the relatively large ionic
radius of Az, it is necessary
to assess whether the organic cation Az can be incorporated into the
lattice of CsPbI3 in terms of stability. The formation
energies of pure and Az-doped CsPbI3 can be defined as
follows 2  where x is
the replacement ratio of Cs by Az. E(Cs1–xAzxPbI3), E(CsI), E(AzI), and E(PbI2) are the total energies of Cs1–xAzxPbI3, CsI, AzI, and
PbI2, respectively. The calculated formation energy of
CsPbI3 is 0.17 eV/f.u. The results show that the calculated
formation energy of Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 is −0.01 eV/f.u., which indicates that the phase stability
is apparently enhanced. However, the formation energy is only about
−10 meV, which is not low enough to guarantee the phase stability
at high temperatures. In the words, the short-term stability of Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 can be improved, but
it still suffers long-term instability. Recently, the calculated results
revealed that the phase stability of CsPbI3 can be significantly
improved by large organic cation doping.17

The band gap of the absorber material is very crucial as it
is
related to photovoltaic performance of the device and also determines
the optical absorption in the visible light region. The band gap of
CsPbI3 is 1.31 eV by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) calculation, which is lower than its experimental value.11,12 Our calculated data is well consistent with the reported results.25,26 In order to gain more accurate band gap, HSE06 calculations were
further employed. The band structure of CsPbI3 is shown
in Figure 2a. It can
be seen that CsPbI3 is a direct band gap semiconductor
with a value of 1.76 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental
value (1.73 eV).11,12 Importantly, the value of the
band gap of CsPbI3 rapidly increases from 1.76 to 2.27
eV after Az doping. The electronic structures of halide perovskites
were affected by structural distortion, and the key factor is the
Pb–I–Pb angles.27 Our results
have showed that the enlargement of the band gap can be ascribed to
the larger structural distortion for Az-doped CsPbI3. It
can be observed from here that there is no benefit of Az doping in
CsPbI3 as the band gap increases beyond the ideal value
for photovoltaics. However, Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 may be an ideal material for tandem solar cells due to its
larger band gap.

Figure 2 Band structures of (a) CsPbI3 and (b) Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 at the HSE06 level.

The density of states (DOS) and partial DOS of
pure and Az-doped
CsPbI3 are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that Cs/Az cations do not contribute
to the band edge states. The valence band maximum of pure and Az-doped
CsPbI3 is mainly dominated by the I-5p orbital, while the
conduction band minimum is contributed by the Pb-6p orbital.

Figure 3 Calculated
density of states (DOS) and partial DOS (PDOS) of (a)
CsPbI3 and (b) Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 at the optB86b-vdW level.

We also compared the optical absorption of Az-doped
CsPbI3 at a doping content of 12.5% with that of the pure
CsPbI3. We used an optB86b-vdW functional along with the
scissors correction
to obtain an accurate band gap as that of the HSE06 functional. The
band gap is usually underestimated in PBE calculations and overestimated
for the dielectric properties. Based on the scissors correction, we
compared the optical absorption of Az-doped CsPbI3 with
that of the pure structure CsPbI3, as shown in Figure 4. Due to the larger
band gap, Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 exhibits
a blue-shifted onset with respect to the pure CsPbI3. Although
the optical absorption coefficient is apparently decreased in the
visible spectrum, a slight absorption advantage for ultraviolet light
can be observed. The reduced optical absorption can be ascribed to
the wider band gap. In general, considering the improved phase stability,
the photovoltaic performance of Cs0.875Az0.125PbI3 is expected to be further improved.

coefficients for pure and Az-doped CsPbI3.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our calculated results indicate
that the structural
stability of CsPbI3 can be improved by Az doping. However,
the Az-doped CsPbI3 shows blue-shifted band gap and reduced
optical absorption in the visible spectrum. Further analyses reveal
that the structural distortion of a perovskite material is the main
reason for the improved phase stability and decreased optical properties.
Our work can provide theoretical insight to further explore better
phase stability of the CsPbI3 perovskite.

Computational Methods
Our calculations were carried
out by employing density functional
theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP).28 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) version of the generalized gradient approximation29 (GGA)-based DFT methods using the projector
augmented plane wave (PAW) was adopted.30 The energy cutoff of the plane wave basis was set to 500 eV. The
optB86b-vdW functional was used to account for dispersion interactions
in the halide perovskites.31,32 The criterion of 1
× 10–5 eV for the total energy convergence
was required. The atomic coordinates were fully optimized until the
residual forces were smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. For CsPbI3, a 6 × 6 × 6 k-point mesh was used for structural optimization.
A 3 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh was used for the CsPbI3 supercell. It is well known that the GGA-PBE functional usually
underestimates the band gaps of halide perovskites. In order to obtain
the band gap more accurately, Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE06) hybrid functional was applied.33,34 In the HSE06
method, the screened parameter was set to 0.2 A–1, and 20% of the screened Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange was used
with the PBE functional.
