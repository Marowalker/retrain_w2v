1-Propionyl-5-dimethylaminonaphthalene
(8, 1,5-Prodan)
and two derivatives where the amino group is constrained in a seven-membered
(9) and five-membered (10) ring are prepared.
All three exhibit strong fluorescence and similar degrees of solvatochromism.
Their fluorescence is strongly quenched in alcohol solvents. Because
the amino group in 9 and especially 10 is
forced to be coplanar with the naphthalene ring, the similar photophysical
behavior of all three suggests that emission arises from a planar
excited state (planar intramolecular charge transfer).

Introduction
Prodan (6-propionyl-2-dimethyaminonaphthalene), 1,
is a highly fluorescent molecule whose Stokes shift varies strongly
with solvent polarity.1 Its excited state
has a dipole moment that is nearly double that of the ground state
because of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the amino group.2−5 The nature of the emissive excited state has been the subject of
many studies. In nonpolar environments, fluorescence is thought to
occur from a locally excited (LE) state whose structure is similar
to that of the ground state. In fact, the LE state may be the second
excited state (S2).6 In polar
solvents, the excited state relaxes through ICT. Studies in micelles7 and reverse micelles8−11 are particularly insightful because
both states are present as a result of partitioning between the heterogeneous
environments. Whether the ICT state is accompanied by twisting about
the dimethyl amino group (N-TICT) or possibly the propionyl group
(O-TICT) is still debated.12−14 Calculations tend to support
a planar ICT (PICT) excited state where neither group twists.15,16 The related compound, dimethylaminobenzonitrile (Dmabn, 2, Figure 1), is known
to emit from a twisted ICT (TICT) excited-state. The strongest evidence
for this conclusion comes from the behavior of constrained Dmabn derivatives.
Compound 3 locks the amino group in a small ring, and
it shows only LE emission.17,18 Compound 4 locks the amino group in an orthogonal orientation, and it shows
ICT emission.18,19

Figure 1 Structures of Prodan (1),
Dmabn (2),
and two constrained derivatives 3 and 4.

We have taken a similar approach
to elucidating the structure of
the emissive ICT state in Prodan. Derivatives (Figure 2) with a forced planar amino group (5)20 or propionyl group (6)21 show a fluorescence behavior
that is similar to Prodan, while the twisted derivative 7 does not fluoresce.22 Thus, the behavior
of the three model compounds suggests that Prodan emits from a PICT
state and not from a TICT state.

Figure 2 Structures of constrained Prodan derivatives 5–7.

Of the several regioisomers
of Prodan, the 1,5-derivative (Figure 3) should be a strong
fluorophore. While a derivative with an ethanoyl group was reported
by Turro and Sames et al.,23 others bearing
a cyclopenta[b]-ring fusion have been studied extensively
by Brummond et al.24,25 The fused ring was not expected
to significantly perturb the inherent photophysical behavior. The
latter derivatives fluoresce nearly as strongly as 2,6-Prodan. Moreover,
they absorb at shorter wavelengths, and they show large Stokes shifts.
Unlike 2,6-Prodan, they are quenched in protic solvents. This research
group has made a number of derivatives for bioconjugation studies.26

Figure 3 Structures of 1,5-Prodan (8), constrained
derivatives 9 and 10, and the dansyl group.

1,5-Prodan bears a striking similarity
to the dansyl chromophore
(Figure 3). Both have
a dimethylamino electron-donating group in the 1-position and an electron-withdrawing
group in the 5-position. The dansyl group is often used in the fluorescence
tagging of proteins.27,28 The solvatochromism seen in these
dansyl-tagged biomolecules has been interpreted assuming that the
dansyl group emits from a TICT excited state.29,30 We wondered if 1,5-Prodan might also emit from a TICT state. This
paper reports the preparation of 1,5-Prodan (8) and two
derivatives (9, 10) where the amino group
is locked in a ring structure and compares their photophysical behavior.

Results
and Discussion
Compounds 8–10 were prepared
using the routes
in Scheme 1. The synthesis
of the parent compound 8 follows the same route as our
synthesis of Prodan.31 In the synthesis
of 9, we were hoping that the carboxylic acid produced
from the Michael addition of acrylic acid would cyclize adjacent to
the amino group. Heating this acid in polyphosphoric acid at 120 °C
did generate some of this isomer, but it mostly gave the methylamino
precursor via a retro-Michael addition. The intramolecular Friedel–Crafts
reaction of the carboxylic acid chloride is conducted at 40 °C,
and cyclization occurs at the α-naphthalene position of the
adjoining ring. The preparation of 10 makes use of an
initial Bartoli indole synthesis.32,33

Scheme 1 Preparation
of 8–10
The absorption and emission behavior of 8–10 are consistent with that of the reported cyclopentane-fused 1,5-Prodan
derivative. Brummond et al. found that the latter has fluorescence
quantum yields that are about 60% of those for 2,6-Prodan (1) across a range of aprotic solvents.24 The relative quantum yields for 8–10 were determined
in toluene using anthracene (Φ = 0.30) as a reference. They
are 0.42 ± 0.03, 0.40 ± 0.07, and 0.12 ± 0.01, respectively.
The remaining reported yields in Table 1 are relative to these assignments. The absorption
maxima of these compounds varies little with solvent: 332 ± 3
nm, 339 ± 3 nm, and 351 ± 3 nm for 8–10, respectively. Fluorescence spectra of 8–10 are
shown in Figures S1–S3.

Relative
to 8, constraining the amino group in a 7-membered
ring (9) has little impact on the quantum yields and
the absorption and emission positions. For the five-membered ring
(10), however, both the absorption and emission maxima
are significantly shifted to the red. One consequence of the emission
red shift is that the fluorescence quantum yield is reduced because
of the smaller energy gap between the excited state and the ground
state. The origins of the red shifts in 10 are addressed
in the computational modeling section (vide infra). All three compounds
show strong fluorescence quenching in alcohols.

Despite the
red-shifting in 10 relative to 8 and 9, all three show a similar ICT in the excited
state. The displacement of electron density from the amino group to
the carbonyl group gives rise to an increase in the molecular dipole
moment. Higher polarity solvents are better able to stabilize the
excited state, and, as a result, emission occurs at longer wavelengths.
The degree of charge transfer is reflected in the magnitude of the
solvatochromism. Figure 4 shows the solvatochromic behavior for 8–10.
In these graphs, the emission maximum (wavenumbers) is plotted versus
Reichardt’s ET(30) parameter.34 The latter is a composite scale used to characterize
both the solvent polarity and the effect of solvent H-bonding. For
Prodan and derivatives, multilinear regression analysis shows that
their solvatochromism depends primarily on the polarity of the solvent
but also slightly on the solvent acidity (H-bond donating ability).35−37 The three plots in Figure 4 are roughly linear for the aprotic solvents. The slopes of
the best-fit lines are shown in Table 2. While the plots for 8 and 9 are linear with the protic solvents included, the plot for 10 is not. The deviations with the protic solvents are probably
related to the extreme quenching in 10. One explanation
for the deviation in the plot is that the H-bonding deactivation distorts
the population of excited species, leaving only those of higher energy
(more poorly H-bonded) to fluoresce. Alternatively, finding an emission
maximum for a nearly completely quenched chromophore is problematic.
While comparisons of 10 with 8 and 9 require some caution, there is no significant difference
between the slopes for these compounds in aprotic solvents. Because
the magnitude of the slopes is a reflection of the increase in the
dipole moment of the excited state, all three must experience a similar
degree of charge transfer in their excited states. Fluorophores 9 and 10 can only form a PICT excited state because
the ring systems do not allow orthogonal twisting.

We have found
that certain 2,6-Prodan derivatives are strongly
quenched in alcohol solvents. In the excited state, the H-bonding
interaction with the carbonyl becomes stronger as a result of the
ICT. H-Bonding interactions with two solvent molecules have been implicated
in the quenching mechanism,38 and the magnitude
of quenching can be used as a sensor of solvent acidity.38,39 In Figure 5, the
order of magnitude quenching is captured by taking the log10 of the ratio of Itol/I where I refers to the fluorescence intensity maximum
for a given solvent and Itol is the intensity
in toluene. These values are plotted versus Catalán’s
solvent acidity parameter, SA, a measure of the H-bond donating ability
of the solvent. The intensity in toluene, where there is no H-bond
induced quenching, is used as a reference. The plots are approximately
linear over the range of alcohol solvents. The slopes are shown in Table 3 together with previous
results with several 2,6-Prodan derivatives (Figures 2 and 6). The slopes
for 8–10 are within the standard error of each
other with an average of 2.3. The slopes for 1, 5–6 are also tightly clustered, but their average is
much smaller (0.70). The slopes for 22–24 also
fall close together, but their average (2.1) is much closer to that
for 8–10. The clustering behavior for these three
sets of compounds suggests that the H-bonding interactions are similar
within each set and by extension that the charge densities of the
carbonyl groups in the excited states are also similar. The stronger
quenching for 22–24 relative to 1, 5–6 was ascribed to the carbonyl group being
slightly twisted out of the plane of the naphthalene ring.37 In compounds 23–24, the tert-butyl group forces the nonplanarity, while in 22, it is the seven-membered ring. Evidently, these slight
structural deviations turn on an efficient deactivation channel to
the ground state with H-bonded complexes. With compounds 8–10, a similar deviation arises from the steric interaction with the
peri-H (vide infra). The similarity in the H-bond quenching behavior
of 8–10 corroborates their comparable levels of
charge transfer in the excited states.

Structures for the
ground and excited states were determined using
computational modeling. As with our previous work with 2,6-Prodan
derivatives, we used the semiempirical AM1 method employing a high
level of configurational interactions and a solvation method.20−22 More recent TDDFT calculations are in agreement with the AM1 results.16Figure S4 shows that
the calculated solvatochromism tracks the experimentally observed
values in a linear fashion. The SM5C solvent model captures two-thirds
to three-fourths of the experimental solvatochromism. A recent study
showed similar but better results with a COSMO model (∼85%).40 This model was less effective here.

The
values from several specific structural features are collected
in Table 4. The behavior
of the carbonyl and amino portions are most revealing. In the ground
state, both the carbonyl group and the amino group are twisted out
of plane by ∼50° and ∼40°, respectively. In
the excited state, the carbonyl becomes nearly planar (∼10°),
while the amino group is less twisted (∼20°). These changes
in dihedral angles are also accompanied by changes in bond lengths.
Partial π-bonding occurs between the naphthalene ring and the
amino N and carbonyl C with a decrease in the carbonyl bond order.
The N atom also becomes less pyramidal. The charge-transfer characteristic
of the excited state is shown by the N atom decrease and the carbonyl
oxygen increase in the negative charge. The similarity in these behaviors
for all three compounds further supports the postulate of a PICT excited
state.

The
unusual behavior of 10 with respect to its absorption
and emission positions is also captured by the computational results.
The emission maximum for 10 is predicted to be shifted
to the red by 900 cm–1 and its absorption by 850
cm–1. The other noticeable feature in the table
is that the amino group in 10 is barely twisted in the
ground state (about half as much) and essentially planar in the excited
state (vs 20°). The excited state dipole moment is slightly greater
for 10. The enforced planarity of the amino group in 10 is likely responsible for its differing behavior relative
to 8 and 9. The greater conjugation of the
amino group leads to a slightly higher energy highest occupied molecular
orbital and a lower energy lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (Figure S8).

Conclusions
The
photophysical behavior of two constrained derivatives (9 and 10) was compared with that of 1,5-Prodan
(8). The former fluorophores can only emit from a PICT
excited state because the amino group is locked in a seven- and five-membered
ring, respectively. The change in the emission maxima in response
to solvent polarity (solvatochromism) is a reflection of the excited-state
dipole moment and hence the degree of ICT. Amino group twisting should
result in a large ICT because of the resulting electronic decoupling
with the aromatic system. However, all three show a similar level
of solvatochromism in aprotic solvents. Further, ICT also results
in increased H-bonding with the carbonyl oxygen in the excited state.
With these three chromophores, H-bonding gives rise to efficient quenching.
As also seen with 7,22 orthogonal
twisting should give rise to very strong quenching. However, all three
show similar sensitivity to H-bond-induced quenching. The planarity
enforced by the five-membered ring in 10 gives rise to
red-shifting of the absorption and emission maxima, resulting in a
smaller quantum yield. Despite this difference in the behavior of 10, the solvatochromism and H-bond quenching results suggest
a PICT excited-state structure for all three. By extension, these
results cast suspicion on dansyl being a member of the class of TICT
chromophores.

Experimental Section
General Information
NMR spectra were obtained with
an Agilent DD2-400 or Varian Mercury VX-400 spectrometer. High-resolution
ESI-MS were acquired with a Bruker Apex-Qe instrument. All solvents
were of spectrophotometric grade. Reagents were obtained from Acros
Organics or Sigma-Aldrich. Absorption and fluorescence data were collected
using a fiber optic system with an Ocean Optics Maya CCD detector
using a miniature deuterium/tungsten lamp and a 366 or 405 nm LED
light source, respectively. Solution cells were thermostated at 23 °C.
Fluorescence spectra were reported after the following manipulations:
(1) the electronic noise was subtracted from the raw emission intensity
and (2) the wavelength scale was converted to wavenumbers, and the
net intensity was multiplied by λ2/λmax2 to account for the effect of the abscissa-scale conversion.
The resulting intensity was divided by the spectral response of the
Hamamatsu S10420 CCD. AM1/SM5C semiempirical calculations were conducted
using AMPAC 9.1 from Semichem, Inc. Keywords employed were AM1, SDC.I.

reaction was stirred for 15 min after the addition was complete. Propionyl
pyrrole (920 mg, 7.48 mmol) was added slowly keeping the temperature
below −60 °C. The cooling bath was removed, and the mixture
was allowed to warm to −45 °C. Water (200 mL) was added,
and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with CH2Cl2 (100 mL ea). The combined organic layers were dried over
CaCl2, and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The residue
was purified by silica gel chromatography using a gradient elution
with ethyl acetate in hexanes (0 → 10%). Fractions containing
the compound were combined, concentrated, and distilled under high

3-((5-Bromonaphthalen-1-yl)(methyl)amino)propanoic
acid, 15, (5.14 g, 16.7 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (45 mL). Dimethylformamide (DMF; 20 drops)
was added followed by the dropwise addition of oxalyl chloride (6.64
g, 52.7 mmol). The reaction was stirred at 0 °C under CaCl2 drying for 1.5 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the
remaining oxalyl chloride was removed under high vacuum. The residue
was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (75 mL), and aluminum
chloride (6.7 g, 19.9 mmol) was added. The mixture was heated to reflux
for 3 h. The reaction was allowed to cool and then it was quenched
with aq NaHCO3 (12.5 g/300 mL) with stirring. The aq phase
was extracted with 10% CH2Cl2/hexanes (2 ×
75 mL ea) and once with 20% CH2Cl2/hexanes (75
mL). The combined organic layers were washed with ice-cold water (100
mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in
vacuo. The fraction boiling between 160 and 210 °C at 0.2 Torr
gave crude 7-bromo-1-methyl-2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,8-bc]azepin-4(1H)-one, 16, (1.3 g, 25%)
which was used without further purification. 1H NMR (400

7-Bromo-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphtho[1,8-bc]azepine (17)
7-Bromo-1-methyl-2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,8-bc]azepin-4(1H)-one, 16, (3.89
g, 13.4 mmol) was dissolved in diethylene glycol (64 mL). To this
solution was added powdered KOH (3.0 g, 53.5 mmol), hydrazine hydrate
(5.3 mL, 109 mmol), and water (1.3 mL). The mixture was heated to
145 °C for 30 min under N2. A Dean–Stark trap
was inserted, the mixture was heated to 180 °C for 4 h, and 1.5
mL of fluid was collected. The reaction was allowed to cool and then
poured into water (250 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted five times
with CH2Cl2 (50 mL ea). The combined organic
layers were diluted with hexanes (300 mL) and then washed four times
with ice-cold water (125 mL ea). The organic phase was dried over
MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The first aqueous
layer was neutralized with NH4Cl and salted out with NaCl.
The organic phase that separated was allowed to evaporate, and the

6-Bromo-1H-benzo[g]indole, 18, (2.01 g, 8.17 mmol) was dissolved
in dry DMF (10 mL). The solution was cooled in an ice-water bath,
and NaH (0.90 g, 60% in oil, 22.5 mmol, washed with hexanes) was added
in several portions. The reaction was stirred for 30 min before adding
CH3I (2.26 g, 9.55 mmol). Stirring was continued overnight.
The reaction mixture was added dropwise to a rapidly stirred solution
of NaCl (60 g) and NH4Cl in water (350 mL). Stirring was
continued for several hours until the solution cleared leaving an
oily residue. The aqueous solution was decanted. The residue was taken
up in CH2Cl2 (175 mL). The decanted solution
was extracted twice with CH2Cl2 (50 mL ea).
The organic solutions were combined, washed twice with water (150
