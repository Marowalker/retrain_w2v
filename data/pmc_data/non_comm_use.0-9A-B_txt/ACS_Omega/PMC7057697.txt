Carbonic
anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a membrane-bound enzyme associated
with tumor hypoxia and found to be over expressed in various tumor
conditions. Targeting CAIX catalytic activity is proven to be efficient
modality in modulating pH homeostasis in cancer cells. Proteoglycan-like
(PG) region is unique to CAIX and is proposed to serve as an antenna
enhancing the export of protons in conjunction with facilitated efflux
of lactate ions via monocarboxylate transporters. Moreover, the PG
region is also reported to contribute to the assembly and maturation
of focal adhesion links during cellular attachment and dispersion
on solid supports. Thus, drug targeting of this region shall efficiently
modulate pH homeostasis and cell adhesion in cancer cells. As the
PG region is intrinsically disordered, the complete crystal structure
is not elucidated. Hence, in this study, we intend to sample the conformational
landscape of the PG region at microsecond scale simulation in order
to sample the most probable conformations that shall be utilized for
structure-based drug design. In addition, the sampled conformations
were subjected to high-throughput virtual screening against NCI and
Maybridge datasets to identify potential hits based on consensus scoring
and validation by molecular dynamics simulation. Further, the identified
hits were experimentally validated for efficacy by in vitro and direct
enzymatic assays. The results reveal 5-(2-aminoethyl)-1,2,3-benzenetriol
to be the most promising hit as it showed significant CAIX inhibition
at all levels of in silico and experimental validation.

Introduction
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a membrane-bound,
zinc metalloenzyme
with extracellular catalytic domain involved in catalyzing reversible
hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2) to bicarbonate (HCO3–) and proton (H+) ions.1−4 The expression of CAIX is very much limited in normal tissues to
gastric epithelium.1,5 However, its overexpression has
been reported in various tumor conditions including breast,6 lung,7 cervix uteri,8,9 colon/rectum,10−12 oral cavity,13,14 gallbladder,15 ovary,16 liver,17 brain,18 and pancreas.19 Overexpression of CAIX in tumor cells favors
cellular survival at an acidified extracellular environment as it
modulates pH homeostasis and thereby promoting ATP synthesis, cell
proliferation, and migration.1,2,20−24 Matured CAIX comprises four domains: an N-terminal proteoglycan-like
domain (PG), catalytic domain (CA), transmembrane helical segment,
and a short intracytoplasmic tail.25,26

The
proteoglycan-like domain (38–112 residues) of CAIX is
an intrinsically disordered region that spans the extracellular region
of the cell.25−27 It gets the name as it shares significant similarity
with the keratan sulfate attachment domain of aggrecan; however, no
studies have shown the occurrence of glycosaminoglycan chains on the
PG domain.25−27 The PG region has mainly been reported to be involved
in cell–cell adhesion and facilitation of pH homeostasis.28−30 It also plays a significant role in tumor invasion.31 The expression of CAIX remains basal in most cells but
shoots up in hypoxia-induced tumor cells.32 Moreover, this region does not occur in any other isoform. All these
factors make the PG region a viable hotspot for specific targeting
of cancer cells. As the PG region is intrinsically disordered, determining
the complete 3D structure still remains as a challenge.

Intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) are a group of proteins
that lack a well-defined structure but are biologically active and
functional.33−38 IDPs are usually characterized by many specific features like low
overall hydrophobicity, high net charge, and higher flexibility.33 Earlier studies have shown that 25–30%
predicted eukaryotic proteins are partially disordered and 70% of
the signaling proteins to harbor disordered regions.39,40 IDPs under controlled conditions show specific functions, which
may complement ordered proteins and domains.33 In the absence of controlled conditions, these IDPs get involved
in multiple roles manifested as various pathogenic conditions in humans.41,42

IDPs are usually very dynamic in nature and mostly have random
coil conformations,43−45 and many of these IDPs have a good level of conformational
propensities along their sequences.46−48 These unfolded regions
can also act as a specific recognition site for target binding49,50 and also could interact with different partners to adopt distinct
conformations.50,51 In general, X-ray crystallography
methods are used to determine the protein structure in an atomic level;
however, in the case of IDPs, the inherent higher flexibility makes
the structure prediction more challenging. NMR studies do provide
some insights into conformational changes in IDPs with higher limitations.52 Hence, molecular dynamics simulation methods
becomes the preferred choice due to the vast availability of efficient
algorithms and optimal force fields. Many of the earlier studies have
clearly demonstrated the efficiency of MD methods in analyzing the
conformational changes in IDPs.53,54 In the current scenario,
molecular modeling, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics studies
have become an integral part of computational drug designing.55−60

There is a paucity of studies providing structural insights
into
the CAIX proteoglycan region (IDP) compared to the catalytic site.
Recent studies have also shown a monoclonal antibody M75 to selectively
target an epitope at the proteoglycan region.61 There is an earlier study on peptides targeting the proteoglycan
region based on phage display and biopanning.62 Moreover, our group has also shown oligopeptides derived from M75
antibody to be efficient inhibitors of CAIX in HeLa cells.63 As the proteoglycan-like region is unique to
CAIX, it becomes essential to know about its conformational landscape
for designing selective inhibitors targeting the tumor cells. Hence,
in this study, in order to design chemical moieties targeting the
PG-like region, we performed an extensive microsecond scale simulation
of the complete PG-like region to sample the conformational landscape.
Further, a consensus virtual screening and scoring of multiple conformations
were performed to decipher the most potential and specific inhibitors
from NCI and Maybridge databases targeting the PG-like region. Moreover,
the identified inhibitor was validated for efficacy in modulating
the CAIX activity in vitro. This study is first of its kind to propose
chemical inhibitors targeting the PG-like region of CAIX.

Results and Discussion
Molecular
Modeling of PG Domain Seed Structure
The
most optimal structure of the PG domain as predicted by I-TASSER was
chosen based on the significant C-score (−1.53) and was refined
by the FG-MD tool. However, this refined structure showed only 39.6%
of residues to be in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot.
Hence, this model was loop refined using modeller9v12 and was also
optimized to remove the steric clashes within residues. Further, the
loop-refined model was again geometry optimized using ModRefiner.
In addition, the model was also refined using WHATIF program to remove
atomic clashes (bumps) by rotating the side chain torsion angles (chi1,
chi 2, and chi 3). The loop refinement, ModRefiner and WHATIF-based
optimizations, were iteratively repeated until the most plausible
seed structure was achieved. The final most optimal structure showed
94.3% residues in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot. Similarly,
this structure also showed Verify 3D score of 82.3%, which is of allowed
range for a plausible model. Additionally, WHATCHECK analysis was
also performed to infer the stereochemical quality, wherein almost
all the parameters ensured the plausibility and overall quality of
predicted model. Further, this model was subjected to molecular dynamics
simulation.

Microsecond Molecular Dynamics Simulation
of PG Domain
As the net charge of the seed structure was
calculated to be −23,
therefore, 23 Na+ ions were added to neutralize the simulation
system prior to initiation of microsecond scale production run. On
trajectory analysis, the potential energy of the system was found
to stabilize at around −4.98 × 105 kJ/mol in
500 steps. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) plot across 1 ms
time scale simulation inferred the system to undergo extensive conformational
changes until 750 ns and tend to have minimal changes after 750 ns
(Figure 1a). Further,
the time-dependent radius of gyration plot (Rg) infers the overall
compactness of the PG domain to be fluctuating till 750 ns and tends
to lower after this time scale (Figure 1b); however, it did not tend to relax. Similarly, the
root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) plot infers all the residues to
be highly fluctuating (Figure 1c). Moreover, the time-dependent secondary structure element
formation inferred the majority of residues to remain in coil formation
throughout the simulation (Figure 1d). Also, this analysis infers a typical physiological
behavior, as expected for a disordered protein.

ns. (c) Gyration plot representing the level of compactness of the
protein attained during the production run of 1000 ns. (d) Time-dependent
secondary structure analysis, which shows the coil formation throughout

Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and Free Energy Landscape
(FEL) Sampling
PCA analysis was performed to ensure higher
conformational sampling efficiency. The projection generated for eigenvectors
V1 and V2 showed the molecular movement to be in same direction with
least cosine values. The PCA projection generated corresponding to
eigenvalues were used to perform FEL analysis. Based on free energy
landscaping, the coordinates in different clusters were analyzed to
identify most optimal conformations. Here, 100 conformations per cluster
(from four clusters) were chosen in accordance to the timeframe corresponding
to the eigenvalue coordinates in FEL and were proceeded for further
analysis (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Four minimal energy clusters with representative structure
from
each cluster after FEL analysis.

Geometric Clustering
Additionally, geometric clustering
was performed to identify a similar group of structures sampled during
the MD simulation. A backbone RMSD cutoff of 1 Å was chosen to
determine cluster membership. All clusters were mutually exclusive,
so a structure can only be a member of a single cluster. The structure
with the largest number of neighbors in each of the cluster was taken
as the cluster representative. The geometric clustering yielded a
total of 96,719 clusters with the highest of five conformations and
the lowest of one conformation grouped to a single cluster (cutoff
of 1 Å RMSD). Thus, a total 97,119 conformations of the PG region
were obtained.

Fishing of the Most Minimal Conformation
of the PG Domain with
Crystallized Fragment as Bait
In PCA, eigenvalues were used
to perform FEL analysis, by which the coordinates corresponding to
the time interval with minimal energy were identified and proceeded
for further analysis. In the case of geometric clustering, the Gromos
method was used with a cutoff of 1 Å in order to identify the
cluster membership. By this method, 96,719 clusters were identified,
and the mid-average conformation from each cluster was sampled. These
two approaches were implemented in order to sample varied conformations
from the MD run, and this in turn shall aid in identifying the most
approximate conformation of the PG domain. Further, the datasets resulting
out of PCA and geometric clustering were used to fish the most optimal
conformation with crystallized 9-mer fragment of the PG-like domain
as bait using the Kpax tool. This resulted in a total of six conformations,
which showed structural alignment with the crystallized fragment (<2.0
Å RMSD) (Figure 3). The entire conformational fishing protocol was automated through
an in-house developed pipeline and has made it publicly available
in GitHub (https://github.com/inpacdb/Kpax_automation_script).

from FEL and geometric clustering.

High-Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS) of the Sampled PG Domain
Conformations and Consensus Scoring
The optimized crystal
fragment of PG epitope and six conformations obtained after fishing
of minimal conformation were subjected to virtual screening versus
NCI and Maybridge compounds (Table 1). The virtual screening results were compared to find
the ligands that showed higher binding affinity across all the conformations
in a consensus manner. The resultant topmost hit, namely, 5-(2-aminoethyl)-1,2,3-benzenetriol,
based on its binding affinity and commercial availability was subjected
to in silico ADMET predictions and was proceeded to validation by
MD simulation and in vitro studies (Figure 4).

The topmost hit 5-(2-aminoethyl)-1,2,3-benzenetriol)
showed hydrogen-bonded
interactions at the epitope representing regions (LPGEEDLPG), though
the docking was conducted in blind mode (without defining the active
cavity). The optimal docked complex amongst the six conformations
was found to be the component of geometric clustering with a significant
docking score of −6.38 kcal/mol and a prime/MM-GBSA score of
−40.87 kcal/mol. The compound showed hydrogen-bonded interactions
with Glu 86, Leu 89, and Glu 87 of the epitope on the modeled conformation.

ADME Predictions and FAF-Drug 4 Profiling of the Top Hit
The identified top hit was subjected to in silico ADME predictions
using Qikprop 3.5 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2012). The
compound showed a molecular weight of 169.1 Daltons, volume of 594.5,
SASA of 379, dipole of 3.4, hydrogen bond donor of 5, hydrogen bond

Metab of 6, human oral absorption of 2, rule of 5 zero violation,
and rule of 3 zero violation. It also showed significant physiochemical
properties to be within the allowed range to be considered as a potential
hit. Further, GSK 4/400 Rule (FAF-Drug 3) and Pfizer 3/75 Rule were
also implemented to evaluate the drug safety profiling, wherein the
compound was found to be fit with higher confidence (Figure 5).

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Top Hit–PG
Complex
Further, the protein–drug complex simulation
was carried
out for PG–Top hit complex for 1 ms was implemented using the
GROMACS package with GROMOS 53a6 as a force field. On RMSD trajectory
analysis, it could be inferred that the backbone atoms fluctuate (Figure 6a) in the holo form but remains in proximity to Apo form wherein the RMSD for the small molecule remained stable and
was in complex with the PG domain with least perturbations (Figure 6b). Similarly, in
the case of comparative analysis of the root-mean-square fluctuation
(RMSF) plot with the Apo form, it could be inferred
that the residues in the holo form is less fluctuating
(Figure 6c) across
1 ms of production run. Moreover, the intermolecular hydrogen bond
formation during the 1 ms simulation was analyzed, and the results
infer that five hydrogen bonds remain unperturbed during the entire
production run (Figure 6d). Further, the secondary structure analysis also inferred that
there are not much changes incurred on post-binding of the ligand
to the PG domain.

PCA analysis was also
performed to ensure high sampling efficiency.
The eigenvectors V1 and V2 were compared for the protein–ligand
complex, and free energy landscape was also plotted based on PCA analysis.
The coordinates for best clusters were identified, and the average
structure corresponding to such coordinates at a particular time scale
was proceeded for further analysis. The projection generated for eigenvectors
V1 and V2 at the minimum energy value of 1.22 kJ/mol for the coordinate
(0.4373,–0.1602) was chosen as the most optimal complex (Figure 7).

and neutral potential, respectively.

Cell Viability Assessment of Small Molecule Using Presto Blue
The identified top hit that showed higher binding affinity in inhibiting
CAIX was further checked for the impact on cell viability in HeLa
cells. The results infer a dose-dependent activity on increasing the
concentration. The top hit (targeting PG domain) showed 52% of inhibition
of viability at a concentration of 400 μM (Figure 8), and thus the IC50 was finalized as 400 μM/100 μL.

Figure 8 HeLa cells showed 52%
of viability when treated with 400 μM
concentration of top hit for 48 h (Student’s t test was used for statistical analysis: *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
when compared with control).

Cell Lysate-Based CAIX Activity Assay To Validate Small Molecule
The CAIX activity on drug treatment was assayed functionally by
recording the time course acidification of HeLa cell lysate following
addition of saturated CO2 solution. The acidification time
was also noted for control (untreated) and acetazolamide (AZM; a known
inhibitor of CAIX) treated cells (identified drug) (Figure 9a). From the experiments performed,
it was observed that NSC-298534 could reduce the acidification rate
at 400 μM of concentration when compared to the untreated. Further,
dose dependency was checked using 750 μM of concentration, which
also inferred that the compound could reduce the acidification rate
(Figure 9b). Further,
statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA (repeated measures
implementing Greenhouse–Geiser), which inferred that p value 0.5 > 0.05 is not statistically significant for
400 μM and 0.000 < 0.05 for 750 μM is statistically
significant.

Cell Adhesion Assay in HeLa Cells on Treatment
with Top Hit
On treatment of top hit (400 μM) to HeLa
cells, the cell
adhesion ratio was found to be significantly reduced than the control
cells (Figure 10).
The compound showed a reduction of 76% cells to be non-adherent at
400 μM, wherein the known drug AZM showed only 43% non-adherent
cells.

Conclusions
This
study is the first of its kind to propose a sample of the
conformational changes of the PG-like region in CAIX at microsecond
scale simulation. Further, on trajectory analysis, six optimal conformations
were sampled based on FEL and geometric clustering. Further, these
conformations were subjected to HTVS, wherein, based on consensus
scoring and binding pose analysis, the most potential hit and the
most plausible conformation of the PG region were predicted. Further,
this complex was cross-validated in terms of binding affinity at microsecond
scale simulation. The results inferred the higher order of significance
in terms of hydrogen-bonded interactions and stable protein–ligand
contacts. The resultant topmost hit (5-(2-aminoethyl)-1,2,3-benzenetriol)
was also experimentally validated in vitro to assess the impact of
drug treatment on extracellular acidification rate and cell adhesion
and on direct enzyme. The results infer that the proposed hit to be
in effective in targeting CAIX activity at the cellular and at the
direct enzyme levels. Thus, in this study, we propose a strategic
approach to sample the optimal conformations of disordered proteins
by coupling FEL and geometric clustering methods, which shall be adopted
for other disordered proteins. Recently, targeting the PG-like region
has been proposed to be a promising approach for modulating CAIX-mediated
pH homeostasis in cancer cells. The ligand molecule proposed in this
study shall pave way for future studies on lead optimization and in
vivo validations.

Computational Methods and Experimental Section
Molecular
Modeling of PG Domain for Starting Structure
As the 3D structure
of the entire PG region is not yet crystallized,
in this study, we intend to probe its conformational landscape at
physiologically simulated conditions. To start with, the protein sequence
of the PG region was BLASTP64 analyzed
to identify suitable templates for homology modeling. As there were
no significant hits, the starting structure of PG for MD simulation
was modeled using the I-TASSER server65 and was refined by the FG-MD tool.66 Prior
to simulation, the starting structure was also refined to fix the
stereochemical errors using Modeller9v1267,68 and ModRefiner.69

Microsecond Molecular Dynamics
Simulation of PG Domain
Further, to understand the conformational
landscape of the modeled
and refined structure of the PG-like region, MD simulation was performed
using the Gromacs package.70 As the PG
domain is highly disordered, extended MD simulation for 1 ms time
scale was performed with GROMOS 53a6 as a force field,53 which is highly utilized for studying intrinsically
disordered proteins due to it efficient handling of hydration states.
To start with, the refined PG structure was used as seed conformation
and placed in a cubic box with SPC water as a solvent. The protein
was centered with a distance of 0.9 Å from the boundary of the
box. Further, the system was neutralized by adding counterions. Following
which, the system was stabilized in a step by step manner by cycles
of steepest descent minimization. The coulombs and van der Waals contacts
in the protein were restrained with maximum iterations of 1000 steps
with cutoff values of 0.9 and 1.0 nm, respectively. Later, the system
was equilibrated under the NVT and NPT ensemble using Leap-frog integrator
for 100 ps simultaneously maintaining the Berendsen temperature coupling
and Parrinello–Rahman pressure coupling for 300 K and 1 atm,
respectively. A particle mesh Ewald method was implemented to calculate
long-range electrostatic interactions using a grid size of 10 ×
10 × 10 (grid spacing of 1.0 Å).70 Finally, the production run was performed for 1 ms time scale, and
trajectories were analyzed for conformational landscape.71−73 The XMGRACE software was used for generating the plots from final
trajectory (http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/).

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Free Energy Landscape
(FEL) Sampling
PCA and FEL analysis were performed to ensure
high sampling efficiency of the conformational landscape of the PG
domain and also to extract the slow and functional motions of the
PG domain.74 Initially, in order to calculate
the PCA, covariance matrix C was plotted and the
elements Cij in the matrix C is represented as follows:  

Here, Xi and Xj are defined as the instant coordinates of the ith and jth atom, respectively, and the
average coordinate of the ith and jth atom is defined by [Xi] and [Xj] ensembles, respectively. Further,
diagonalization of the obtained covariance matrix C was performed. Subsequently, eigenvalues and vectors were determined
for performing the PCA.74 In general, eigenvectors
determine the direction of the motions, and the eigenvalues show the
magnitude of the motions through the direction. Further, FEL analysis
was performed to understand the conformational changes of the PG domain
based on PCA obtained.75,76 Free energy ((ΔG(X)) is calculated by the equation as
follows:  

Here, KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute
temperature, and P(X) is the probability
distribution of the conformation ensemble
along the principle components.75,76 Thus, based on the
free energy values of the conformations, the stable and transient
states of the PG domain were sampled.

Geometry-Based Clustering
of PG Conformations
Similarly,
geometric clustering was also performed to group ensembles of conformations
sampled during MD simulation. An RMSD cutoff 1 Å was chosen to
determine cluster membership. All clusters were mutually exclusive,
so a structure can only be a member of a single cluster. The structure
with the largest number of neighbors in each of the clusters is taken
as the cluster representative.70,77

Fishing of Energy Minimal
Conformation of the PG Domain
A database comprising 97,119
conformations was created from 400 conformers
resulting from the best four PCA clusters (top 100 from each cluster)
along with representative conformations of each cluster (96,719 conformers)
from geometric clustering. Further, the crystallized PGEEDLPG epitope
from M75 antibody in complex with the PG epitope (PDB ID 2HKF)61 was structurally superimposed to each conformer in the
database created, and the RMSD was calculated using FAST protein structure
alignment and database search tool named Kpax.78 An in-house developed shell script was utilized to develop
a pipeline for iterative aligning of each conformer in the database
with the epitope and to automate the reporting of RMSD scores. The
optimal conformers were fished based on the structural closeness of
epitope with the conformer scored in terms of least RMSD values. Further,
these conformers were used for virtual screening and consensus scoring
studies.

High-Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS) of Multiple Conformers
of the PG Domain
The optimized crystal complex (PG epitope)
and six conformations obtained after fishing of optimal conformations
were used to generate receptor grid using Glide79,80 ((grid-based ligand docking with energetics) Schrödinger,
LLC, New York, NY, 2012)) so as to perform virtual screening of NCI
(National Cancer Institute; https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/ncidb2.2) and Maybridge compounds (http://www.maybridge.com/). Initially, the ligands were prepared
and filtered using standard methods (application of Lipinski rule
of five and removal of reactive functional groups) using LigPrep (Schrödinger,
LLC, New York, NY). Further, a high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS)
protocol of Schrödinger suite was used for virtual screening
and scoring of ligands.81−86

During the HTVS process, the van der Waals radius scaling
was set to 1.0 Å to allow a free of scaling to soften the nonpolar
regions of the receptor and rest of other atoms. Further, the geometry-optimized
small molecules were successively docked to the receptor, ensuring
a flexible sampling with not more than 300 atoms and 50 rotatable
bonds.85,86 The final energy based favorable conformation
was selected from 100 poses generated per docking and was finalized
based on the docking score and H-bond score. During the screening
process, successive elimination of ligand hits was performed through
three filtering modes provided by Schrödinger suite: 50% of
HTVS hits were passed to standard precision (SP), and 50% of the best
hits from SP were passed to extra precision (XP) mode. This extensive
sampling and advanced scoring will result in highly enriched hits.85,86 Finally, the top scoring ligands were (10%) chosen as best hits
and subjected to prime MM/GBSA scoring and were in accordance to the
score.85,86 This process was repeated for the PG epitope
and for all the six sampled conformations. The ligands obtained for
each conformation were cross-compared using in-house scripts to identify
the ligand that is synonymous in terms of binding affinity with all
the conformations and were proceeded for further ADMETox prediction,
MD analysis, and experimental validation.

top hit ligand was subjected to in silico ADME predictions using Qikprop
3.5 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2012). The compound was
also checked for significant physiochemical properties within the
allowed range to be considered as a potential lead. Further, GSK 4/400
Rule (FAF-Drug 3) and Pfizer 3/75 Rule were also implemented to evaluate
the drug safety profiling and toxicity,87 wherein the compound was found to be fit with higher confidence.85

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Small-Molecule
PG Complex
Further, the PG domain–drug complex that
showed the most
significant binding affinity in terms of docking score, prime MM/GBSA,
and number of H-bonds was subjected to MD simulation53 for 1 ms adhering to a similar protocol as followed in
the case of the Apo form.

Culturing of HeLa Cells
for in Vitro Experiments
HeLa
Cells (procured from NCCS, Pune) were cultured in DMEM high glucose
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Invitrogen,
India). Further, these cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C till full confluency is attained and were
further used for in vitro experiments.63 The top hit NSC-298534 (catalog #151564) and acetazolamide (catalog
#A6011) were procured from Sigma.

Cell Viability Assay Using
Presto Blue
The cells were
seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well
plate with 100 μL of culture media and incubated at 37 °C
using a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h. The cells were then
treated with varying concentrations of the small molecule in fresh
medium and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator
for 48 h.63,88 Cytotoxicity was tested by adding 10 μL
of Presto Blue and measured at an excitation wavelength of 560 nm
and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Cell viability (or cell survival)
was calculated as (test OD/control OD) × 100.63

CAIX Functional Assay in HeLa Cells
To perform this
assay, intact HeLa cells were suspended in isotonic buffer (130 mM
NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 20 mM Hepes). Further, the pH of the isotonic
buffer was adjusted to 8.0 at 4 °C before suspending cells. The
cells in the buffer were then exposed to varying concentrations of
the small molecule for 20 min at 37 °C.63 Further, 1.5 mL of the suspension was added to a stirred reaction
vessel, and the pH change was monitored with a Hannah pH meter63,89 with respect to time after adding 0.5 mL of 100% CO2-saturated
water. The rate of acidification was analyzed by plotting the pH change
with respect to time in seconds.63,90−92

Direct Enzymatic Assay Using CO2 as a Substrate
CAIX direct activity assay procedure was adopted from a protocol
described by Chirică et al.93 This
assay is based on the monitoring of pH variation due to the catalytic
conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate in the presence of the
CAIX. Bromothymol blue was used as the indicator of pH variation.
The assay was performed in an ice bath by adding 100 μL ice-cold
CO2 saturated water to 100 μL mixtures of containing
25 mM Tris-SO4 with CAIX enzyme (cat. #10107-H08H) treated
with small molecule.63 The catalytic activity
was quantified in terms of the Wilbur–Anderson unit (WAU).
One Wilbur–Anderson unit (WAU) of activity is defined as (T0 – T)/T, where T0 (non-enzymatic reaction) and T (enzymatic reaction) are recorded as the time (in seconds)
required for the pH to drop from 8.3 to the transition point of the
dye in control (buffer without enzyme) and in the presence of enzyme
and and in drug co-treated conditions.63,94−96

Cell Adhesion Assay in HeLa Cells
HeLa cells at a density
of 25 × 103 cells/well were pretreated with an inhibitor
for 15 min before being plated onto a gelatin-coated 24-well plate
and were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Further, 4% paraformaldehyde
was used to fix the attached cells to the surface.63 A Nikon ECLIPSE
TS2-Fl microscope was used to capture the microphotographs,
and the number of attached cells was quantified using NIH Image J
software. Based on these images, differential analysis was performed
for treated and untreated conditions.63
