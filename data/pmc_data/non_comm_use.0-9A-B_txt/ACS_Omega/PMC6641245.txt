In this work, we have explored a
simple and facile approach to
prepare optically active helical polyamides. The hydroxyl groups of l-TA and d-TA were protected by O-alkoyl
ester, and the resulting enantiomers, l-2,3-di-O-acetyl-tartaric acid (l-ATA) and d-2,3-di-O-acetyl-tartaric acid (d-ATA) crystals, were obtained.
A pair of aliphatic homochiral polyamides of PA-l and PA-d are prepared using l-ATA, d-ATA, and achiral
1,11-undecanediamine as building blocks via interfacial polycondensation.
PA-l and PA-d display negative and positive mirror
circular dichroism (CD) spectra images in both solution and solid
state. Moreover, the polyamides in solid state display different CD
signals and stronger optical activity compared to those in ethanol
and even the related chiral monomers in solid state, which was due
to the helical conformation of the polyamides in solid state. Scanning
electron microscopy results indicated that the aggregations of PA-l express left-handed helical sense, whereas those of PA-d express right-handed helix. In addition, the induced CD signals
from the chiral conformation of the backbone become weaker when increasing
the temperature from 0 to 60 °C in dilute solution. Either of
the polyamides displays relatively stable CD images in solid state
when elevating the temperature from 0 to 90 °C.

Introduction
The development of
artificial optically active helical polymers
attracts the particular interest of synthetic polymer scientists because
of a wide variety of potential applications, including chiral separation,1−6 asymmetric catalysis,7−9 and enantioselective crystallization,10 to name but a few.11 However, there are several limited factors restricted to the practice
applications of the optically active polymers, such as complicated
and tightly controlled polymerization processes, inadequate monomers,
and expensive chiral catalysts or initiators.12−15 In addition, the practical applications
of optically active polymers are commonly in solid phase.16−21 Therefore, a facile preparation of the optically active materials
and the evaluation of chiral information in solid state are of great
significance. Polyamides have been widely utilized in industry due
to their high tensile strength, high elongation, excellent abrasion
resistance, and high resistance to chemicals.22 And the interfacial polycondensation is one of the important methodologies
used to synthesize polyamides for its tolerance of impurities and
nonequivalence of reactants, short reaction time, and mild reaction
temperature.23−26 In fact, optically active polyamides have received considerable
attention in recent years, whereas only few reports have characterized
the chirality of the polyamides in solid state.27 Furthermore, the developments of the polymer with desired
chirality through introducing chiral atoms into the backbone are very
limited, especially aliphatic linear polymers.

Yokoyama and
co-workers prepared poly(p-benzamide)s
bearing a chiral side chain on the nitrogen atom, which exhibited
circular dichroism (CD) signals in solution, and the helical conformations
were investigated by the study of oligo(benzamides) with different
molecular weights and narrow polydispersity.28 However, the chain-growth condensation polymerization employed in
the reports is restricted to construct π-conjugated polymers.29 Mallakpour and co-workers30 employed aromatic isophthalic acid composed of m-substituted
chiral group and diisocyanates as monomers to synthesize polyamides,
which displayed optical activity in solution. In 2014, Akagi and colleagues31 prepared the films of PA610 and PA6T with one-hand
spiral morphologies by interfacial polymerization via a water layer
and a chiral nematic liquid crystal layer, whose chirality could affect
the swirling directions of the spiral morphology of the polyamides.
But no literature was reported to illustrate that the helical films
of PA610 and PA6T could retain the one-hand spiral morphologies after
reprocessing. Bou and co-workers developed tartaric acid-based polyamides
synthesized by polycondensation of bis(pentachlorophenyl)tartrates
with diamines activated as N,N′-bis(trimethylilyl)
derivatives under rigorous exclusion of moisture conditions and relatively
long polycondensation time (3–4 days), and the tartaric acid-based
polyamides display specific rotation in solution but does not report
about the optical activity in solid phase.32,33

In this work, the successful preparation of optically active
polyamides
with no detectable amounts of racemization has been realized by introducing
chiral pools in the backbone via a facile method. The linear aliphatic
polyamides with optical activity were prepared from naturally occurring l/d-tartaric acid and 1,11-undecanediamine, which can
be developed through fermentation from light wax. The optical activities
of the resulting polyamides PA-l and PA-d were studied
in both solution and solid state and compared to their responding
monomers. Moreover, the aggregations of the polymers in solid state
were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). And the thermostability
of the chirality of the polyamides was studied in both solution and
solid state.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of Monomers
and Polyamides
The preparation
of monomers and polymers is illustrated in detail in Supporting Information. The monomers l-2,3-di-O-acetyl-tartaric acid (l-ATA) and d-2,3-di-O-acetyl-tartaric acid (d-ATA) are silky white
crystals due to the high purity of ATAs obtained in this work. And
the two enantiomers display no differences in the melting point, as
illustrated by the 1H NMR and IR spectra shown in Supporting
Information (Figures S1 and S2).

Schematic illustration of the preparation of PA-l and PA-d is shown in Scheme 1. The two monomers d-ATA and l-ATA were
used as building blocks to prepare aliphatic linear polyamides with
1,11-undecanediamine. To avoid the change of the configuration of
the intermediates and obtain the high stereotactic polyamides, interfacial
polycondensation was employed.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Preparation
of PA-l and PA-d
IR, 1H NMR, and elemental analyses corroborated
the
chemical structure anticipated for the polyamides. The IR spectra
of PA-l and PA-d (Figure S3) are very similar, showing the typical acetoxy group (1764 cm–1 for C=O; 1200 and 1060 cm–1 for C–O–C; 1370 and 2931 cm–1 for
CH3) as well as amide group (1664 cm–1 for C=O; 3300 and 1550 cm–1 for N–H)
and methylene stretching (2850 cm–1). 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed the chemical structure of PA-l and PA-d, exhibiting the expected area and multiplicity
with no trace of any other signal detected in the spectra (Figure S4). And the results of the elemental
analysis of the polymers are illustrated in Table 1.

The molecular weight of the polyamides
was evaluated by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) (Figure S5), and the
results are shown in Table 1. The number-average molecular weights (M̅n) of PA-l and PA-d are 50 100
and 51 300 g/mol, respectively, and the polydispersity indexes
(PDIs) are both less than 3.4.

The solubilities of both PA-l and PA-d were assessed
in an assortment of representative solvents, and the results are compared
in Table S1. These polyamides with polar
ester side groups favor solubility in organic solvents, due to the
side groups disrupting the intermolecular associations. Specifically,
PA-l and PA-d display similar solubility patterns
irrespective of the configuration of the ATA segments. These polyamides
are soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl
pyrrolidone (NMP), and dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature.
As a result, DMF can be used as the solvent when the molecular weight
is determined via GPC. The solubilities of PA-l and PA-d in ethanol were 9.48 and 10.25 mg/mL at 20 °C, respectively,
so that their CD spectra could be tested in dilute ethanol.

Configuration
of the Monomers and the Polyamides
Table 2 shows that the specific
optical rotation ([α]D20) of l-ATA in water is −17.8 and −19.8° in ethanol at
20 °C and that of d-ATA is +22.9° in water and
+25.4° in ethanol at 20 °C, which indicates that ATAs derived
from l-TA and d-TA are of opposite chirality. To
make a further study of the configuration of the l-ATA and d-ATA, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was employed to
characterize the chirality of the monomers in ethanol and in the solid
state at 20 °C. Figure 1 shows that l-ATA displays the same negative Cotton
effect with l-TA at about 215 nm, and d-ATA the
same positive Cotton effect with d-TA, which indicates that
the configuration of the acylated tartaric acid did not change during
the reaction. Therefore, we name the monomers l-(−)-2,3-di-O-acetyl-tartaric acid (l-ATA) and d-(+)2,3-di-O-acetyl-tartaric acid (d-ATA), which are chirally
pure enantiomers with different configurations. Moreover, the CD spectra
of l-ATA in ethanol have the same negative Cotton effect
at around 215 nm with that in the solid state. And d-ATA
displays similar CD signals in ethanol and solid state. The results
demonstrate that the conformations of the monomers d- and l-ATA in solution and in the solid state have not influenced
these CD signals significantly. It was reported that the tartrate
molecule prefers a planar zigzag conformation, and the conformation
with intramolecular hydrogen bonding attached to the same chiral carbon
atom is energetically favored.34 Therefore,
the relatively stable CD signals in both solution and solid state,
thanks to the contribution of a planar T-conformer of tartrate molecule,
do not change much in different phases.

We measured the specific optical rotations
([α]D20) of the polymers in different
solvents, which are illustrated
in Table 3. The choices
of the solvents were restricted to DMSO, NMP, and hexafluoroisopropanol
(HFIP) because the polymers could not be soluble in water and slightly
soluble in ethanol (Table S1). Table 3 shows that the [α]D20 values of PA-l are −13.0, −6.7,
and −1.8° in DMSO, NMP, and HFIP, respectively, and +12.8,
+6.9, and +2.0° for PA-d. Essentially, [α]D20 for a chiral species is a composite of the response
of the multiple conformations.35 As a result,
optical rotations of chiral molecules in solution states are solvent-dependent.
In the case of PA-l and PA-d in solution, hydrogen-bonded
interactions between the isotropic solvents and the polymers play
critical roles in their optical rotation. When the molecules of the
nonchiral isotropic solvents combine with the polymers, the intermolecular
and intramolecular interactions among the polymers themselves become
weaker and then the possibility of forming different conformations
increases obviously, which is responsible for the decrease in the
asymmetry of the polymers.36,37 The polar protonic
solvent of HFIP tends to hydrogen-bond with polymers the most among
the three solvents, and DMSO the least due to its nonprotonic nature
and being less polar than NMP. As a result, the polyamides in HFIP
display the least value of [α]D20, and
the largest in DMSO among the three solvents. Nevertheless, PA-l and PA-d display opposite specific optical rotation
values regardless of the type of solvents.

To make a further investigation of the optical activity of the
polyamides influenced by both intrinsic chirality of the tartrate
units and the conformations of the main chain, UV–CD spectra
of the polyamides were researched and compared to the corresponding
optical activity monomers. Figure 2 shows the CD spectra and PA-l and PA-d at 20 °C in ethanol (2.08 × 10–6 mol/mL, calculated as constitutional repeating unit), which were
prepared at the same concentration that of l-ATA and d-ATA (Figure 1). Both the polyamides exhibit characteristic mirror positive and
negative CD spectra images in ethanol, and the CD signals are weaker
than the corresponding monomers. The Cotton effect of the l-ATA is negative at 215 nm, whereas that of the PA-l is
negative at 208 nm. The CD signals of polyamides have an opposite
reversal at 195 nm, where the corresponding monomers do not show any
such absorption (abs) tail. The less intense Cotton effect of polymers
compared to the monomers results in flexible linear backbones, which
tend to be less ordered in dilute ethanol, leading to intramolecular
compensation of asymmetry.36 Meanwhile,
the UV absorption of the polyamides (about 3.1 abs) is much stronger
than that of the responsive monomer (about 0.4 abs), which is because
the UV absorption of amide groups is stronger than that of ester and
carboxyl groups. Again, the absorption of UV–CD spectra of
the polyamides in far-ultraviolet regions are dominated by the n−π*
(λmax = 220 nm) and π–π* (λmax = 200 nm) transitions of amide groups (Figure S6).38,39 Tartaric acid derivatives containing
the carbonyl group (C=O) were expected to exhibit CD spectra
within the range of the n−π* transition (200–230
nm).40 Thus, the differences of the CD
signals of polymers between the corresponding monomers are due to
the amide groups of the polymers and the conformations of the polymers.
Furthermore, there are other evidences support this claim.

Figure 2 UV–CD
spectra signals of PA-d and PA-l at 20 °C in
ethanol (c = 2.08 × 10–6 mol/mL
of the repeat unit) and solid state prepared
from ethanol solution (the thickness of the film was evaluated by
the equal UV-abs to that in ethanol).

Interestingly, the CD spectra of the polyamides in solid
state
vary clearly from those in solution state. Taking PA-l for
example, Figure 2 shows
that the CD signals of PA-l in solid film state display clear
splits observed with crossovers at 215 and 197 nm, whereas a weak
split with a crossover at 199 nm was observed in solution. Furthermore,
the negative ellipticities at 205 nm (−50 mdeg) of PA-l in film state are much more intense than those in ethanol at 210
nm (−13 mdeg) when the similar UV absorption was measured.
According to the exciton coupling theory, the split of the CD signal
is related to the interaction between the adjacent chromophores.41 In our case, the chiral pools of ATA segments
induced the neighbor amide group to a chiral chromophore.42 The weak split in dilute ethanol is due to the
less intermolecular aggregation and disordered conformation. And the
enlarged optical activity in solid state results from the induced
chiral amide groups displaying high enantiopurity for the same twisted
direct of the amide groups in the backbone.42 Meanwhile, the chiral PA-d displays mirror opposite CD
images to PA-l in both ethanol and solid state (Figure 2).

In fact,
several reports supported that the amplification of chirality
could be associated with the helical structure.43−46 And the deduction was confirmed
by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the morphologies of PA-l and PA-d in solid film state obtained from ethanol
solution. Figure 3 shows
SEM images of the PA-l (a) and PA-d (b) films by
casting the polymers in ethanol. Interestingly, the helical sense
morphologies with left-handed and right-handed directions for PA-l and PA-d were observed from the SEM images, which
indicate the aggregations of the polyamides that preferred helical
conformation.

Figure 3 SEM images of the PA-l (a) and PA-d (b)
films.

The interactions of noncovalent
bonds always play critical roles
in the stabilization and conformation of the polyamides, where carbonyl
oxygen atom and amide hydrogen atom readily form intermolecular hydrogen
bonds. It is indicated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) that PA-l and PA-d are partly crystallized (Figure S7). Polymers crystallized because the chains can pack together
in a regular manner.47 Repulsion by the
adjacent substituents and the same configuration of the chiral carbon
atoms in the main chain are responsible for the single-handed twisted
of the backbone, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds maintain the conformation.

Thermostability of the Optical Activity of the Polyamides
UV–CD spectra were used to study the thermostability of
PA-l and PA-d in ethanol when increasing the temperature
from 0 to 65 °C. Figure 4 shows that the characteristic λmax of PA-l and PA-d red-shifts from 206 to 210 nm for the first
Cotton effect, whereas the CD intensity rather expresses stability
in ethanol, which was related to the substituted ester groups. On
the other hand, the reversal of the CD signals from 193 to 200 nm
for the second Cotton effect varies obviously when increasing the
temperature from 0 to 65 °C. Taking PA-d in ethanol
for example, the ellipticity is −20 mdeg at 195 nm at 0 °C,
whereas it decreases to −4 mdeg at 200 nm when increasing the
temperature to 65 °C (Figure 4). In a word, the λmax red-shifts
about 5 nm and the magnitude of the ellipticity increases about 16
mdeg when heating from 0 to 65 °C. And similar changes occurred
in PA-l, in which the ellipticity intensity increased about
20 mdeg and red-shifted about 2 nm around 190 nm. In fact, the variety
of CD Cotton effects from 190 to 200 nm may be related to the induced
chiral chromophores of the amide groups in the backbone of the polyamides.
Meanwhile, the UV absorption improves from 2.7 to 4.1 abs, which is
induced from the π–π* electron transition of amide
groups.45

Figure 4 UV–CD spectra of PA-l and
PA-d in ethanol
when increasing temperature from 0 to 65 °C.

A part of UV absorption chromophores and chiral pools are
released
from the inside of the coiled chain when warming the solution. Meanwhile,
the flexible backbones tend to be less ordered, which is responsible
for the intramolecular compensation of asymmetry. Combining these
factors together, the CD signals derived from the chirality of the
ATA segments are rather stable in temperature, whereas the induced
CD (ICD) signals derived from the chiral conformation of the backbone
are themo-related.

The UV–CD images of PA-l in
solid state vary slightly
when the environmental temperature was changed in the range of 0–90
°C. Figure 5 shows
that CD images kept rather stable in the ellipticity and the characteristic
λmax. The characteristic λmax red-shifts
slightly from 222 to 223 nm, and the ellipticities at 208 nm increased
from −10 to −8.9 mdeg when the temperature elevated
from 0 to 90 °C. In a word, both the characteristic λmax at 222 nm red-shifts and the absolute value of ellipticities
at 208 nm increases slightly. The results suggest that the chirality
of the polymers is thermodynamically stable in solid state. In fact,
crystalline polymers could have rather stable conformation when the
intermolecular interactions of the noncovalent bonds are not broken
at certain elevated temperature.

PA-d in solid
state when increasing the temperature from 0 to 90 °C.

Conclusions
In
summary, we employed bio-based monomers l-ATA, d-ATA, and 1,11-undecanediamine as building blocks for the polycondensation
of novel optically active materials via a facile method. In addition, l-ATA and d-ATA derived from naturally occurring l-TA and d-TA are chiral enantiomers. PA-l and PA-d display opposite and intensive optical activity
in both solution and solid phase, which has not been reported in previous
studies. The CD spectra were greatly influenced by the secondary structures
of the polymers in solution and the film state. Furthermore, the aggregations
in solid film increased the optical activity of the polymers resulting
from the single-handed helical conformation. The induced CD signals
derived from the chiral conformation of the polyamides are related
to the temperature in solution. However, the chirality of the polyamides
is rather stable in solid state when varying temperature. The polyamides
are more soluble in organic solvents than the traditional nylons,
which may open applications in the membrane field, such as separation
membranes, coatings, polymer blends, and composites, to name but a
few. Consequently, the polymers are expected to be highly facile chiral
packing materials because of their low cost, high optical activity,
and thermostability in solid state.

and Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The
data were collected in the 2θ range of 3–55° at
2°/min.
