Supercapacitors,
also known as electrochemical capacitors, are
attracting much research attention owing to their high power density,
long-term cycling stability, as well as exceptional safety compared
with rechargeable batteries, although the globally accepted quantitative
benchmarks on the power density, cycling stability, and safety are
yet to be established. However, it should be noted that the supercapacitors
generally exhibit low energy density, which cannot satisfy the demands
where both high energy density and power density are needed. To date,
various methods have been employed to improve the electrochemical
performances of supercapacitors. Among them, introducing redox additives
(or redox mediators) into conventional aqueous electrolyte is regarded
as one of the most promising strategies. The redox additives in aqueous
electrolyte are widely demonstrated to be able to increase the charge
storage capability via redox transformation and thus enhance the electrochemical
performances. Herein, we present a brief review on the classification,
state-of-the-art progress, challenges, and perspectives of the redox
additives in aqueous electrolyte for high performance supercapacitors.

Introduction
Growing
research attention has been paid to the various kinds of
energy storage systems in recent years owing to the concerns of the
depletion of fossil fuel reserves and associated burgeoning demand
for the renewable energies such as solar energy and wind energy. Supercapacitors,
also known as electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors, have
been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for energy storage
with fantastic properties of high power density, long-term cycling
stability, as well as exceptional safety,1 although the globally accepted quantitative benchmarks on the power
density, cycling stability, and safety are yet to be established.
However, it should be noted that the supercapacitors generally exhibit
unsatisfactory and much lower energy density than rechargeable batteries,2 and thus extensive research efforts are devoted
to increasing the energy density of supercapacitors. Practically,
a combination of batteries and supercapacitors for balancing both
energy and power densities is proposed to satisfy the demands where
both high energy density and power density are needed.

Generally,
the energy density of a supercapacitor is determined
by both the electrode materials and the electrolyte. From the perspective
of electrode materials, the most widely investigated electrode materials
are carbon-based materials in which the charges are stored by the
oppositely charged ion double layers formed at the electrode/electrolyte
interface (known as electrical double-layer capacitors, EDLCs).3 Owing to this intrinsic charge storage mechanism,
the EDLC electrodes deliver low specific capacitances of generally
100–150 F g–1. Thus, the most widely adopted
method now-a-days is to seek for electrode materials beyond carbon
with rich redox reaction sites on/near the surface (known as pseudocapacitance),
which will deliver much higher specific capacitance than carbon. Besides,
battery-type electrodes also demonstrate much higher specific capacitance
via diffusion-controlled redox reactions.4 However, their capacitances are limited by the slow diffusion rate
and moderate electrolyte penetration.

Electrolyte has also been
identified as one of the key components
of supercapacitors, and various kinds of electrolytes have been developed,
including liquid electrolyte and solid/quasi-solid-state electrolyte
(SSE).5 The SSE (including gel electrolytes
and inorganic solid-state electrolytes) can act as both an ionic conduction
medium and separator, and thus one of the major advantages using SSE
is the simplification of packaging and fabrication processes. The
liquid electrolyte can further be divided into aqueous electrolyte
and nonaqueous electrolyte, of which the aqueous one is the most widely
adopted in the literature owing to its high ionic conductivity and
excellent safety properties. However, it should also be pointed out
that the aqueous electrolyte also delivers some significant disadvantages
such as narrow voltage window. To solve this issue, a new concept
such as the water-in-salt is suggested which can expand the voltage
window up to 3.0 V without water splitting.6 Besides, it is generally supposed that the electrolyte should be
electrochemically inert in which no redox reactions occur.5 Inspired by the pseudocapacitive electrodes with
rich redox reactions on/near the surface of electrodes that can provide
additional capacitance, a growing number of researchers are beginning
to pay attention to the redox electrolyte to achieve the enhanced
specific capacitances.7 For carbon electrodes,
considering the various redox states of electrolyte additives and
the redox transformation of electrolyte species, the capacitance of
the full devices may be several times higher than that without redox
additives in the electrolyte. If the pseudocapacitance or battery-type
electrodes are used to replace carbon electrodes, the specific capacitances
and corresponding energy densities of the devices can be further increased.8 Regarding the calculation of overall energy density
of supercapacitors including the mass of redox additive, the globally
accepted standards are yet to be established. However, it should be
pointed out that if the redox additive electrolyte serves as the ionic
charge carriers, the total charge storage capability may depend on
the formula mass of the redox species.7 Albeit with the aforementioned advantages, the redox additives in
the electrolyte often lead to the degradation of cycling stabilities
as many redox electrolytes act as a shuttle, thus thwarting the very
same purpose for which they have been added, which limit their practical
applications.

Herein, in this mini-review, we will give a brief
review on the
classification, state-of-the-art progress, challenges, and prospects
of the redox additives in the aqueous electrolyte.

Classification
and Development of Redox Additives in Aqueous
Electrolyte
Adding redox additives into the aqueous electrolyte
has been proven
to be an effective method to improve the electrochemical capacitive
performance of supercapacitors besides the commonly used electrode-modifying
method. The mechanism of energy storage with redox additive in aqueous
electrolyte is pretty complex. Taking the carbon electrode for example,
the general mechanism for electrochemical capacitance enhancement
by the redox additive in the electrolyte can be schematically illustrated
in Figure 1.7 The total electrochemical reactions include the
following processes: (i) the redox species (O and R for oxidized and
reduced states) enter into the hydrophilic pore of the carbon electrode
(processes 1 and 1′); (ii) the redox species reach transition
states (O* or R*) (processes 2 and 2′); (ii) the transition
states are converted to adsorbed states (Oads and Rads) (processes 3 and 3′); (iv) the electrons transfer
between the adopted states (processes 4 and 4′); and (v) probably
without invoking adsorption (processes 5 and 5′) in the bulk
electrolyte. Generally speaking, the pore size distribution of the
carbon electrode plays a vital role in the electrochemical energy
storage performance. Taking aqueous electrolyte with iodide-based
redox additive (the size of I3– solvated by four
water molecules is 1.8 nm) for example, it is regarded that the mesopore
(2–50 nm) is the most adapted for the electrosorption process.9

Several selection criteria should
be considered for the practical
applicability of redox additives in aqueous electrolyte. The standard
redox potential is an important criterion which can guide the balancing
of redox activities in the electrolytes and electrodes. Besides, the
solubility in water, toxicity, safety, material cost, and environmental
influence should also be considered.

Currently, for different
aqueous electrolytes, various kinds of
redox additives have been developed. According to their chemical compositions,
the as-reported redox additives in aqueous electrolyte for supercapacitors
can be generally divided into two catalogs: inorganic and organic
redox additives. Based on the number of redox species, the redox additives
can be catalogued to single and dual redox additives. Also, from the
perspective of pH values, the redox additive can be classified into
redox additives in acidic electrolyte, in alkaline electrolyte, and
in neutral electrolyte, respectively. In the following parts, we will
focus our discussion on the classification of inorganic and organic
redox additives.

State-of-the-Art Progress on Redox Additives
in Aqueous Electrolyte
Inorganic Redox Additives in Aqueous Electrolyte
The
first reported redox additive of aqueous electrolyte was proposed
by Tanahashi et al. in 2005 by mixing the solution of 5.0 M H2SO4 (50.0 mL) and 1.0 × 10–1 M AgNO3 (1.0 mL), which was inspired by the results that
Cu-deposited activated carbon fiber cloth (ACFC) could make a contribution
to the enhancement of capacitance via redox transition reactions.10 Owing to the pseudocapacitance associated with
the redox reaction of the Ag+/Ag redox couple, the ACFC
electrodes exhibit a maximum specific capacitance of 248 F g–1 which is 300% higher than that without the AgNO3 additive.
Later in 2007, Li et al. investigated the electrochemical behaviors
of porous carbon electrode with the introduction of Cu2+ and Fe2+ into H2SO4 electrolyte,
which delivered a significantly improved specific capacity of 223
mAh g–1 at a current density of 0.1 A g–1.11 The mechanism can be expressed as 1   2  These redox additives generally utilize the
reversible conversions of metal ions at different valence states and
are thus restricted to work only in acidic and neutral electrolytes,
which cannot be effectively applied in alkaline electrolyte together
with the high performance pseudocapacitive and battery-type electrodes.

Different from the metal ion redox additives, Na2MoO4 is a typical redox additive which can work in various aqueous
electrolytes. By adding 0.1 M Na2MoO4 into 1
M Li2SO4 solution, the specific capacitance
of the AC//AC supercapacitor was increased to 121 F g–1 from 103 F g–1 in the voltage range of 1.6 V owing
to the pseudofaradaic contribution. Moreover, the potentiostatic floating
of the capacitor at 1.6 V could work stably for 120 h in the Li2SO4 + Na2MoO4 electrolyte.
The Na2MoO4 additive has also been demonstrated
to work effectively in acidic electrolyte. For instance, Sun et al.12 investigated the electrochemical capacitive
performance of N-doped porous carbon in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte with the addition of different amounts of Na2MoO4. It was found that by tuning the amount of Na2MoO4 in the electrolyte a high gravimetric specific
capacitance of 841 F g–1 was achieved at a high
specific current of 15 A g–1, which was 375.1% of
that in pure H2SO4 electrolyte, and a high value
of 440 F g–1 was still maintained at a much higher
specific current of 35 A g–1. Introducing another
redox additive to construct dual redox additives with different potentials
can simultaneously contribute to the enhanced energy storage capability.
In this regard, Xu et al.13 introduced
KI into the Li2SO4 + Na2MoO4 electrolyte to form dual redox additives. For a nanoporous carbon
electrode, by optimizing the molar ratio and concentration of redox
additives as well as the voltage window of the device, the resultant
specific capacitance enhancement of 17.3 times can be achieved compared
to that without redox additive added in a two-electrode configuration.
The increase of specific capacitance is attributed to the synergistic
effect of Na2MoO4 and KI, as demonstrated in Figure 2. The faradaic capacitance
resulting from the redox additive in the electrolyte is correlated
with the chemical affinity between carbon materials and adsorbed ions,
which might lead to the formation of complexes with substance of (MoxIyO4x)n−Cz during the electrochemical reactions and thus promote
the redox reactions of Mon+ and In– at the interface of the carbon electrode
and electrolyte ions and edge site carbon atoms.

between Na2MoO4 and KI in the mixed electrolyte
and (b) GCD curves at various current densities. (Reproduced with
permission from J. Power Sources2017, 341, 448–456).13

Except for acting as a coadditive
in the electrolyte, KI has also
been tested as an aqueous electrolyte salt for a supercapacitor with
a carbon electrode and exhibits exceptionally high electrochemical
performance.14 Owing to the stable redox
reactions resulting from the various oxidation states of iodine from
−1 to +5, an extremely high specific capacitance of over 1840
F g–1 can be achieved which is several times higher
than that in conventional H2SO4 electrolyte.
The detailed mechanisms are described as follows: 3   4   5   6  Inspired by the above-mentioned results, the
same authors9 further investigated the
influence of alkali metal species (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium,
and cesium iodides) on the electrochemical capacitive performances
and found that among all these alkali metal iodides RbI exhibited
the highest specific capacitance of 2272 F g–1,
while LiI displayed the lowest value of 300 F g–1. The difference is caused by many factors such as ion/ion and ion/solvent
interactions, ion mobility and polarizability, hydration effects,
as well as faradaic reactions of iodide species. Additionally, KI
has also been investigated as a single redox additive in acidic, alkaline,
and neutral electrolytes, respectively. For instance, Wang et al.15 reported the electrochemical capacitor with
aqueous KI–KOH electrolyte, which demonstrated superior electrochemical
performance with improved specific capacitance, lower self-discharge
rate, and low-temperature stability compared with that with pure KOH
electrolyte. Similar to the KI additive, KBr has also been found as
an effective redox additive in aqueous electrolyte for supercapacitors.
Tang et al.16 investigated the electrochemical
capacitive properties of functioning carbon nanotube electrodes and
discovered that the maximum energy density in 1 M Na2SO4+ 0.5 M KBr electrolyte was 4 times larger than that in 1
M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The enhanced performance
is attributed to the Br–/Br3– conversion.

It is known that VO2+/VO2+ species
exhibit well reversible redox reactions at the electrode–electrolyte
interface and are applied in vanadium redox flow batteries extensively.
VOSO4 as the source of VO2+ was thus introduced
as a promising redox additive to evaluate the electrochemical performance.
Very recently, Wang and co-workers17 studied
the electrochemical performance of vanadium oxide nanoribbons/3D-graphene
composites (VOx-3DG) in the aqueous electrolytes
of KCl and VOSO4 + KCl. They observed that both the capacitance
and stability could be significantly improved in VOSO4 +
KCl electrolyte compared with those in KCl electrolyte. By optimizing
the electrolyte, the capacitance of the VOx-3DG electrode after 500 galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD)
cycles was 7.2 times higher than the initial value. The improvement
is attributed to the dual role of VOSO4 during the GCD
process, namely, the capacitance increase by its redox reactions and
the facilitation of vanadium oxide electrodeposition over the electrode
surface.

Besides, the aforementioned inorganic redox additives,
K3Fe(CN)6 and K4Fe(CN)6, are the most
widely used redox additives in aqueous electrolyte for supercapacitors
and have attracted considerable attention in recent years. The first
example of K3Fe(CN)6 as a redox additive was
proposed by Su et al. in 2009.18 By adding
0.1 M K3Fe(CN)6 into 1 M KOH as electrolyte
and using Co–Al-layered double hydroxide (Co–Al LDH)
synthesized via a homogeneous precipitation method as a battery-type
electrode, an initial discharge specific capacitance of 712 F g–1 was obtained, while the value was only 226 F g–1 in pure KOH electrolyte. The high reversibility of
the Fe(CN)63–/Fe(CN)64– ion pair at the electrode/electrolyte interface coupled
with the redox transition of Co(II)/Co(III) in the Co–Al LDH
electrode is believed to be the key factor to improve the electrochemical
performance. As revealed by CV at a slow scan rate, the hexacyanoferrate
(II) or (III) ions can interact with Co–Al LDH, and the hexacyanoferrate
ions play the role of “electron shuttle” in the charge/discharge
processes of the Co–Al LDH. The corresponding schematic illustration
of the energy storage mechanism is shown in Figure 3. Furthermore, the Fe(CN)63–/Fe(CN)64– is also demonstrated
to be able to work in neutral electrolyte. For instance, by combining
laser-scribed AC with K3Fe(CN)6 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the electrochemical capacitive
performances were significantly improved. A specific capacitance of
364.6 mF cm–2 was delivered, which was 13 times
higher than that using nonscribed AC electrodes and acetonitrile-based
electrolyte (28 mF cm–2). As discussed above, Fe(CN)63–/Fe(CN)64– can work as a redox additive in various electrolytes and is compatible
with both EDLC electrode and battery-type electrode. Notably, constructing
an asymmetric supercapacitor is regarded as an effective method to
improve the energy density of the device. In this fashion, Nagaraju
et al.8 assembled an asymmetric supercapacitor
with cauliflower-like nickel selenide nanostructures as a cathode
and commercially available AC as an anode in the 1 M KOH + 0.02 M
K3Fe(CN)6 electrolyte. The device exhibited
a high energy density of 32.8 W h kg–1 at a power
density of 677 W kg–1 and 98% capacity retention
after 5000 cycles. The results successfully demonstrate the practical
applicability of a K3Fe(CN)6 redox additive.

electrode. (Reproduced with permission from Phys. Chem. Chem.

Organic Redox Additives
in Aqueous Electrolyte
Compared
with inorganic redox additives in the electrolyte, organic redox additives
have also attracted considerable research attention owing to the structure
diversity. Hydroquinone (HQ) is the first reported organic redox additive
that can work effectively in acidic electrolyte.19 By adding 0.38 M HQ into 1 M H2SO4 (HQ/H2SO4) as electrolyte, the specific capacitances
of four different types of carbon electrodes were at least two times
higher than those without HQ in electrolyte. Initially, the increase
is attributed to the additional pseudocapacitive contribution arising
from the quinone/HQ faradaic reactions. Further investigation20 demonstrated that when constructing the hybrid
AC//AC supercapacitors using the HQ/H2SO4 electrolyte
the anode exhibited a battery-type behavior, while the cathode displayed
a pseudocapacitive hydrogen electrosorption process besides the conventional
EDLC behavior. As a consequence, specific capacitances of 5017 F g–1 for the anode and 477 F g–1 for
the cathode and high energy density of 30.6 Wh kg–1 could be achieved.

To further increase the electrochemical
capacitive performance of HQ/H2SO4, several
methods have been developed. One is introducing another suitable redox
additive to form a dual redox electrolyte to create a tunable redox
shuttle that controls the electron transfer processes. It has been
recently reported21 that adding Keggin-type
phosphotungstate anions into HQ/H2SO4 gives
rise to significantly increased specific capacity and energy density
(40.3 mAh g–1 and 20.0 Wh kg–1) compared with those using a single redox electrolyte (11.4 mAh
g–1 and 4.1 Wh kg–1). Another
method is to modify the molecular structure of HQ. In this way, Gastola
et al.22 prepared the brominated hydroquinone,
dibromodihydroxybenzene (2,5-dibromobenzene-1,4-diol, HQBr), and investigated
its electrochemical performance as a redox additive in KOH electrolyte.
The introduction of bromine into the hydroquinones should change their
physicochemical properties (conductivity, reactivity, mobility, etc.),
and the density function calculations and experiments have confirmed
these expectations. Consequently, when using the optimum HQBr and
KOH contents in the electrolyte, the AC electrodes delivered a high
specific capacitance of 314 F g–1. The outstanding
performance can be attributed to the complex redox activity of the
hydroquinone/quinone couple and Br– conversions,
as demonstrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Several reaction pathways of 2,5-dibromobenzene-1,4-diol during
supercapacitor operation. (Reproduced with permission from J. Power Sources2016, 326, 587–594).22

However, it should be noted that the above-mentioned organic redox
additives are generally composed of small molecules with large HOMO–LUMO
gap (HLG) and thus possess poor electronic conductivity which will
finally result in the low power density of supercapacitors. To overcome
the obstacles, Xiong and coauthors23 designed
an indole-based conjugated macromolecule consisting of a 5,6-dihydroxyindole/5,6-quinoneindole
motif as a redox additive in acidic electrolyte. When coupling the
electrolyte with interconnected porous and honeycomb-like carbon electrodes,
the supercapacitor delivered a high specific capacitance of 205 F
g–1 at an ultrahigh current density of 1000 A g–1. An energy density of 8.8 Wh kg–1 with the maximum power density of 153 kW kg–1 as
well as excellent cycling stability over 20 000 cycles were
achieved. These outstanding performances could be attributed to the
lowered HLG (HLG of 5,6-dihydroxyindole/5,6-quinoneindole of ca. 5.0
eV, while 2.5 eV for the indole-based conjugated macromolecule containing
5,6-dihydroxyindole/5,6-quinoneindole motifs) and increased structural
stability due to higher delocalization energy.

Conclusions and
Perspectives
In summary, introducing redox additives into
aqueous electrolyte
has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the electrochemical
capacitive performance of supercapacitors. The classification and
state-of-the-art progress of the redox additives in aqueous electrolyte
for high performance supercapacitors are briefly discussed. The as-discussed
redox additive in aqueous electrolyte and their electrochemical performances
can be summarized in Table 1.

Despite the above-mentioned
progresses of redox additives in aqueous
electrolyte, several issues still remain and should be addressed to
meet their practical applications. A common challenge for most of
the redox additives is the redox shuttling effect which can cause
a severe self-discharge process (SDP).24 Suppressing the SDP is of great importance as it is closely related
with the energy efficiency of supercapacitors. However, little attention
has been paid to such issues. As pointed out by Chen et al.,24 the primary reason for the fast SDP is the migration
of redox electrolyte between two electrodes. It takes 11 524
s for supercapacitor voltage to decrease from 0.8 to 0.3 V (4.33 ×
10–5 V/s) using the 1 M H2SO4 as electrolyte. However, the time decreases to only 1462 s (3.42
× 10–4 V/s) for the same voltage drop when
using 0.4 M HQ + 1 M H2SO4 as electrolyte. Taking
HQ as an example, as schematically shown in Figure 5, during the charge process, the HQ is transformed
to BQ and adsorbed on the surface of the anode. After that, the obtained
BQ diffuses to the cathode and is finally reduced to HQ, causing severe
SDP. Considering the different mechanisms of redox additives, two
strategies are suggested to suppress the redox shuttling effect: (1)
using ion-exchange membrane to block the migration of the redox species
and (2) choosing special redox additives that can be converted into
insoluble species and deposited onto the electrode during the charge
process.

Another challenge is
the aging of the supercapacitors during the
charge–discharge process. Platek et al.25 investigated the aging mechanism of KI redox electrolyte
and discovered that the test method, galvanostatic cycling, and potentiostatic
floating could influence the aging process in different perspectives.
The float test triggered the redox-based side reactions, while the
cycle test changed the structure of the carbon electrode to accelerate
the aging process. Besides, some other special challenge should be
considered for a special redox additive such as a collector corrosive
issue of the bromine-based redox additive.

Last but not least,
some perspectives will be suggested. First,
most of the redox additives are just tested by coupling with EDLC
electrodes at the present. To further increase the energy density
of the device, pseudocapacitive or battery-type electrodes should
be a better choice. Second, although the aqueous electrolyte possesses
higher ion conductivity than an organic or solid-state electrolyte,
the narrow water-splitting window of 1.23 V will greatly hinder the
improvement of energy density. Therefore, designing a redox additive
that can extend the water-splitting window is of great importance.
Third, from an environmental perspective, seeking for an environmentally
friendly and low-cost redox additive will also show a huge development
prospect. Fourth, for practical application, the redox additive with
some special functions such as low- and high-temperature tolerance
properties should be of particular concern.
