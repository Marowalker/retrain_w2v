Herbal medicine has
been used to countermine various diseases for
centuries. However, most of the therapeutic targets underlying herbal
therapy remain unclear, which largely slow down the novel drug discovery
process from natural products. In this study, we developed a novel
computational pipeline for assisting de novo identification of protein
targets for herbal ingredients. The pipeline involves pharmacophore
comparison and reverse ligand–protein docking simulation in
a high throughput manner. We evaluated the pipeline using three traditional
Chinese medicine ingredients such as acteoside, quercetin, and epigallocatechin
gallate as examples. A majority of current known targets of these
ingredients were successfully identified by the pipeline. Structural
comparative analyses confirmed that the predicted ligand–target
interactions used the same binding pockets and binding modes as those
of known ligand–target interactions. Furthermore, we illustrated
the mechanism of actions of the ingredients by constructing the pharmacological
networks on the basis of the predicted target profiles. In summary,
we proposed an efficient and economic option for large-scale target
exploration in the herb study. This pipeline will be particularly
valuable in aiding precise drug discovery and drug repurposing from
natural products.

Introduction
Herbal
medicines show a wide range of therapeutic effects in countermining
cancers, virus infections, inflammations, hypertension, and so on.1 The power of herbal therapeutics has attracted
increasing attentions. Each year, an increasing number of publications
described the mechanism of action (MOA) underlying herbs such as ginseng,2 echinacea,3 green
tea,4 and ginger.5 Some herbal ingredients such as pancratistatin6 and paclitaxel7 have been applied
in cancer therapy.

In addition to the conventional “wet-lab”
experimental
approaches, computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) serves as an attractive
complementary option in the efficient and economic drug design.8 For instance, docking-based methods have shown
their impressive performance in large-scale structure-based virtual
screening for candidate drugs.9 Most of
docking approaches screen pool of ligands against a defined protein
cavity to identify the best fitting pose. On the other hand, the reverse
docking methods search for putative protein targets that bind to a
single ligand.10 It has been acknowledged
that biologically active herbal ingredients may exert therapeutic
effects through a mode involving multiple targets and low dosage.11 Hence, the reverse docking methodology meets
the requirements of current mechanistic investigation toward herbal
medicine. Previous studies have proposed reverse docking as a viable
direction in the network exploration of herbal medicine12 and in systematic understanding of drug pharmacology
and toxicology.13 Up-to-date, only a few
tools such as INVDOCK,12 TarFisDock,14 and idTarget15 are
available for rapid identification of protein targets for a ligand.
These tools are powerful while having several disadvantages: (1) They
are either limited by small cavity database or constrained by the
long computing time. (2) It is challenging to determine a proper threshold
value to filter out those potential false ligand–receptor interactions.
(3) They are inconvenient to be implemented or updated locally, which
largely hinders their use in practical applications.

Here, we
introduce a novel computational pipeline for large-scale
identification of protein targets for a given ligand. We evaluated
the pipeline efficiency using three well-studied herbal ingredients,
namely, acteoside,16 epigallocatechin gallate
(EGCG),17 and quercetin18 as examples. Furthermore, we illustrate the possible molecular
basis of MOA underlying these herbal ingredients on the basis of their
predicted protein target profiles.

Results
Large-Scale
Target Search of Herb Ingredients
Overall,
the computational pipeline identifies 151, 143, and 128 nonredundant
targets for aceteoside, quercetin, and EGCG, respectively. In this
study, we further refined the target lists by the vina score threshold
of −8.5 kcal/mol for later target analyses. The refined targets
were most likely ingredient targets, and they were listed in a descending
order of the estimated binding ability in Supporting Information Tables S1–S3. For aceteoside, 38 out of
151 predicted targets owned a vina score stronger than the threshold,
including 10 cancer-related targets and 2 asthma-related targets (Supporting Information Table S1). Among the 38
targets, there are 4 known targets for aceteoside and 30 predicted
targets. These results are in agreement with current applications
of aceteoside in antiallergic (asthmatic) and anticancer therapy.19,20 In the same way, we refined 20 and 19 high binding affinity targets
for quercetin and EGCG, respectively. Some of these targets have been
aimed at countermining various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer
disease, and some psychiatric disorders (Supporting Information Tables S1–S3). Among the 20 refined targets
of quercetin, there are 7 known targets and 13 predicted targets.
Among the 19 refined targets of EGCG, there are 7 known targets and
12 predicted targets.

Target Validation by Flexible Binding Analysis
Because
the pipeline preset a large pocket size for high throughput docking
simulation, it’s thus necessary to evaluate the capability
of the Autodock Vina in locating the correct binding site. For this
purpose, we chose the top five predicted protein targets in this study
and downloaded the corresponding known ligand–target complexes
from the PDB database, if available, as reference to evaluate the
binding modes of the predicted ingredient–target complexes.
These selected targets consisted of nine acteoside–target complexes,
seven quercetin–target complexes, and eight EGCG–target
complexes in the predicted list (Supporting Information Tables S1–S3). Of the total 24 predicted ingredient–target
complexes, 16 cases (9/9 for acteoside, 6/7 for quercetin, and 5/8
for EGCG, respectively) had highly similar binding modes with the
known ligand–target complexes (Table 1).

a The comparison of protein pockets
and docking modes were undertaken on the selected top five protein
targets of each ingredient docking list in Supporting Information Tables S1–S3.

As illustrated in Figure 1, both the original ligands (blue color)
and ingredients (red
color) were well aligned in the same protein pockets.

Figure 1 Binding comparison between
ingredients and known ligands with four
predicted targets. The first column of (a–d) illustrates the
binding mode similarity. The red one stands for the ingredient, and
the blue one stands for known ligand in the original PDB file. The
second column of (a–d) illustrates the key residues in the
ligand–protein complexes determined by the commercial software
Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). The third column of (a–d)
shows the key residues in the ingredient–protein complexes.

For instance, quercetin has very
similar binding pose with SGFR
and cGMP-specific 3,5-cyclic phosphodiesterase (PDE5A) as that of
adenosine-5′-diphosphate and 5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-8-(3-methylbutyl)-4-oxo-4H-chromen-3-yl 6-deoxy-α-l-mannopyranoside
(7CA) (Figure 1b,d).
However, in some cases, the best predicted binding site is not at
the known ligand-binding pocket in the PDB structures. For example,
the top prediction of quercetin with serine/threonine-protein kinase
(Chk1) is not in the known pocket; however, the binding affinity between
quercetin and the known pocket is comparable with that of between
quercetin and the new pocket. This finding suggests Chk1 may have
multiple binding sites, and the quercetin–Chk1 interaction
is non-specific.

We have settled the parameters to generate
maximum 20 output conformations
for each docking, to increase the possibility to sample the correct
pocket during blind docking. We have checked whether the docked structure
was able to reproduce the X-ray conformation by checking the root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) between top score conformation and native conformation
from docking of 64 proteins and its corresponding cocrystallized ligands.
There are 23 in 64 cases that the rmsd between top score conformation
and native conformation are smaller than 0.6 nm, and 38 in 64 cases
that the rmsd between top score conformation and native conformation
are smaller than 0.8 nm. It can see the ability of Autodock Vina to
find the correct binding site, and conformation in the top score conformation
is still challenging, but it is still one of the best method to find
the binding conformation efficiently based on the best of my knowledge.
Because the docking is a large approximation and the diversity of
the vina score training data set is limited, it is still necessary
to further validate the result with molecular dynamic (MD) simulation
or wet experiment. Because the vina score cannot guarantee that the
predicted target is a true target, the MD simulation, which is physical
based and more rigid, is important to further validate before doing
experimental validation.

Target Refinement Using MD Simulation
The MD simulation
is helpful to determine the best binding conformation for the predicted
ingredient–target interactions. In almost all cases, the predicted
ingredient–target binding remained relatively stable after
100 ns MD simulation (Supporting Information Figure S1). Further replicated MD simulations consolidated the robustness
of the simulation outcome (Supporting Information Figure S2). The protein target did not experience large conformation
changes after two independent MD simulation, even they started from
random initial velocities. We determined the binding free energy after
MD for the predicted ingredient–target complexes in the Table 2 using the tool G_mmpmsa.

Comparatively, the known protein targets were selected in priority
(Table 1). At the same
time, we summarized the critical residues that contribute to free
energy in Supporting Information Table
S4. The snapshots after 100 ns MD simulation for the three test cases
are shown in Figure 2. The MD simulation analysis provides an ensemble of conformations
for the detailed interactions between the ingredients and target proteins
with more accurate free binding energy. This is helpful for further
precise drug redesign.

Understanding Pharmacology of Herb Ingredients via Target Network
Targets
of Acteoside and Their Pharmacological Activities
Of total
151 targets predicted for acteoside, 4 are known targets
and 34 are highly potential targets. For instance, the NOS2 (or iNOS)
is a known target of several approved or experimental drugs indications
such as inflammatory disease, endocrine disorder, and antithrombotic
therapy as documented in the DrugBank.21 For instance, we predicted acteoside–NOS2 interaction with
an Autodock Vina score of −10.3 kcal/mol. The binding position
and binding mode were similar to that of the known protoporphyrin–NOS2
interaction (PDB_ID: 4nos) (Figure 2a). The
acteoside–NOS2 interaction was also supported by previous work
that acteoside could inhibit enzymatic activity of NOS2 and 5-lipoxygenase.22 The cAMP-specific 3,5-cyclic phosphodiesterase
4B (PDE4) is an known target of acetoside’s analog plantamajoside.23 It ranked top 2 in the predicted targets of
acetoside. The aldose reductase (AKR1B1) is another known therapeutic
target, which is related to the acteoside’s anti-diabetic activity.24 In the predicted target list, the inosine-5-monophosphate
dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) owned a high binding affinity with acteoside
(vina score: −9.5 kcal/mol). The IMPDH2 is a known target of
immunosuppressive agents such as the approved drug mycophenolate mofetil
and mycophenolic acid.25 The predicted
acteoside–IMPDH2 interaction may explain the immunomodulatory
activity of acteoside in vitro.26

Via mapping the 151 predicted targets to the KEGG pathway by the
DAVID webserver,27 we explored the possible
synergistic effects of acteoside (Supporting Information Table S5). Of the 151 predicted targets, 53 are related to metabolism,
20 are related to cancer, and 18 are related to the PI3K-Akt signaling
pathway. In particular, 10 predicted targets are involved in the prostate
cancer (path: hsa05215), including GSK3B and CDK2 that own predicted
affinity better than the cutoff −8.5 kcal/mol. These results
partially help to understand the cancer cell cycle arresting effects
of acteoside.28 Seventeen predicted targets
are related to the biosynthesis of antibiotics, and seven are involved
in the measles pathway (path: hsa05162). Interestingly, it is noted
the Tibetan herb “Ye-Xin-Ba” which contains acteoside
was used to treat measles.29 Besides, four
potential targets are related to the Alzheimer’s disease, which
may be responsible for the memory enhancement effect of acteoside.30 The possible pharmacology network is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Pharmacology network
of acteoside by mapping the potential targets
to the KEGG pathways.

During construction of the pharmacological networks, we highlight
targets that have predicted binding affinity stronger than the threshold
for aceteoside because we care more about the pharmacological effects
of the more relevant targets: targets of quercetin and their
pharmacological activities. The pipeline predicted 143 targets
for quercetin, including 7 known therapeutic targets and 13 highly
potential targets. The cGMP-specific 3,5-cyclic phosphodiesterase
(PDE5A, PDBID: 2h44) is on the top of potential targets in Supporting Information Table S2. This result is consistent with the previous
finding that extraction of red onion peel could inhibit phosphodiesterase
5A (PDE5A), and the activity was mainly caused by flavonoid quercetin.31 Because PDE5A is strongly related to erectile
dysfunction,31 quercetin may serve as the
potential lead in countermining male sexual dysfunction. We also predicted
three known therapeutic targets for cancer therapy: the serine/threonine-protein
kinase Chk1 whose activity could be decreased by quercetin,32 serine/threonine-protein kinase pim-1 (PIM1)
whose activity was inhibited by quercetin (IC50: 1.1 μm)33 and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src
(SRC) whose activity was inhibited by (64.0 ± 4.24)% using 50
μm quercetin.34,35 Besides, quercetin owned the
phytoestrogen-like activity, which is likely via the interaction with
the estrogen receptor β.36,37

We mapped the
143 predicted targets into the KEGG pathway database.
Many targets are related to the metabolic pathways (43 targets), cancer
pathways (23 targets), PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (21 targets), Ras
signaling pathway (20 targets), and so on. In particular, 13 protein
targets are involved in the tuberculosis (path: hsa05152), including
2 high-affinity binding proteins SRC and JAK2. This finding may partially
explain the quercetin’s ability in combating tuberculosis.38 The possible pharmacology network is shown in Supporting Information Figure S6.

Targets of
EGCG and Their Pharmacological Activities
Overall, the pipeline
predicted 128 targets for EGCG, including 6
known therapeutic targets and 11 highly potential targets. Of these
targets, the β-secretase 1 (BACE1), a Alzheimer disease-related
protein, owned high affinity with EGCG (vina score:–9.9 kcal/mol).39 This result agreed with prior findings that
green tea catechins was an inhibitor of BACE1 and may partially explain
the potential application of catechins in Alzheimer’s disease
treatment.40 Moreover, the proto-oncogene
serine/threonine-protein kinase pim-1 (PIM1),41 histamine N-methyltransferase, peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), macrophage metalloelastase (MMP12), and
glutathione S-transferase A3 (GSTA3) are all known targets of EGCG.

The tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, cytoplasmic (WARS, PDBID: 1r6t) is on the top of
predicted targets in Supporting Information Table S7. Previous study found the WARS expression downregulated
by EGCG.42 Literature surveillance also
suggested that WARS was likely the target of l-tryptophan,43 a drug used in promoting serotonin production,
helping healthy sleep, relieving depression, strengthen pain tolerance,
and controlling weight.44 Interestingly,
green tea can promote healthy sleep, as well as mental and emotional
well-being.45 EGCG, as a major activity
ingredient of green tea, may contribute a lot to green tea’s
antifatigue effect.46

We mapped the
128 predicted targets of EGCG into the KEGG pathway
database. Many targets are related to the metabolic pathways (44 targets),
cancer pathways (19 targets), PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (18 targets),
and so on. The possible pharmacology network is illustrated in Supporting Information Figure S4.

Conclusion
Thousands of years’ practice of herbal medicine has provided
valuable clues for safe and better drug development. However, there
still is a huge demand of information such as herb ingredient–target
interactions for aiding rational drug discovery. The docking method
is an economical and practical way to potentially understand MOA of
herb by simulation of ligand–receptor binding. In this study,
we proposed a novel computational pipeline for high throughput ligand
target search against the user-defined structure database. Comparing
with the current existing reverse docking packages, the new pipeline
has several advantages: (1) the pipeline is flexible in controlling
scope of target search by self-defining the protein structure database.
This keeps the pipeline unrestrained in dealing with various simulation
jobs without largely increasing maintenance cost. (2) The pipeline
is comparatively more efficient. Combination of pharmacophore comparison
and flexible docking allows large-scale target screening to be done
in a reasonable computational cost. (3) The core components of the
pipeline are two state-of-art tools, PharmMapper and Autodock Vina,
that can be easily accessed on-line or downloaded. In case the PharmMapper
fails, we further introduced an alternative target search method on
the basis of ligand similarity, whose core is a freeware LiSiCA, to
help narrowing down the target pool. Hence, the pipeline can be easily
updated accompanying with the component software update. (4) The optional
MD simulation on selected docking results further refines the predicted
targets, thus largely reducing the false positives.

Using this
pipeline, we predicted the potential targets of three
herbal ingredients, acteoside, quercetin, and EGCG, in human structural
proteome. Upon the predicted targets, we explored the possible MOAs
underlying these three ingredients by demonstrating KEGG pathway enrichment
analyses. Furthermore, we built the molecular interaction network
for each ingredient to aid better understanding of pharmacological
activities.

However, the computational pipeline is still far
away from perfectness.
For instance, the pipeline is constrained in search of protein targets
with well-solved structures. The pipeline highly relies on the performance
of PharmMapper. Its background pharmacophore database and online interactive
job submission have become the bottleneck of the pipeline. Although,
we introduced a ligand-based target search method as an alternative
choice to PharmMapper, the method is also limited by the availability
of ligand–protein complexes, for example, the complete ligand–protein
interactome extracted from the PDB. Hopefully, with the dramatical
increase in 3D structures of ligand–protein interactions every
year and the consistent enrichment of PharmMapper background database,47 this weakness is expected to be countermined
in the future.

Instead of exploring target network of isolated
compounds, it would
be more interesting to research several compounds within an herb or
from the same source of plant. This is because several ingredients
from one herbal may exert a synergic effect or adding effect by acting
on multiple pathways. In the future, we can search protein targets
with our current pipeline for several herbal ingredients from one
herb to explore the underlying herb curing mechanisms in a more efficient
and systematic way.

Nevertheless, the reverse docking strategy
introduced in this study
provides an alternative and practical way to rapidly identify the
possible protein targets within acceptable computational time. It
would be useful in aiding current pharmacological understanding of
novel compounds in a systematic manner. Furthermore, it will prompt
the modernization process of herbal medicine by identifying potential
ingredient–target interactions.

Materials and Methods
Computational
Pipeline for Reverse Docking
The computational
pipeline consists of two major steps (Figure 4): the pharmacophore-based target filtering
and reverse docking simulation.

Figure 4 Reverse docking pipeline proposed in this
study. The computational
pipeline consists of three major stages. In the first stage, the PharmMapper
sever is used to narrow down the protein pool by the pharmacophore
matching. In the second stage, reverse docking by Autodock Vina is
used for selecting target candidates by structure-based virtual screening
simulation. Finally, MD simulation is used to refine and validate
the candidate targets.

Generation of Potential Target Pool by PharmMapper
The target
filter step helps to filter out the unlikely targets from
the original protein structure pool by pharmacophore comparison. We
used an on-line tool PharmMapper (http://lilab.ecust.edu.cn/pharmmapper/index.php)48 for rapid prediction of potential
targets by comparing the query ligand against the predefined pharmacophore
models. Following the guidelines of PharmMapper, we uploaded the chemical
structures via the job submission form of the website. The default
running parameters were adopted. The server outputs a list of potential
ligand targets subject to the top mapping scores. In this study, we
selected the top 300 PDB structures of human proteins as potential
target pool for further prediction.

As an alternative solution
to PharmMapper, we have developed a tool that can be used for inverse
protein target searching based on deep neural network model and word2vec
techniques.49 The protein pocket and ligand
was converted into vectors as input, and a densely fully connected
neural network was used to do the training over the PDBBIND database.
The resulted model (we named it DeepBindVec here) shows high efficiency
and relative high accuracy (AUC above 0.9 in test set) and indicates
that it’s suitable for inverse protein target searching and
has potential to replace PharmMapper server in our pipeline. It is
independent of protein–ligand binding complex structure; thus,
it has the potential to overcome the limitation of LigandScout50 which is the core of PharmMapper. When using
the DeepBindVec as core to do inverse target searching, we named it
IVS2vec, deposited in the gitlab (https://gitlab.com/llb671205/densely-fully-connected-neural-network/tree/master). We also proposed a ligand-based target search method to help narrowing
down the target pool as another alternative solution to PharmMapper.
The principle of the method is that ligands having similar structures
may have similar protein binding abilities. The core components of
the ligand-based target search method are a freeware LiSiCA51 (http://insilab.org/lisica/) and user-defined ligand–protein interaction database. The
LiSiCA applies the clique algorithm to measure the 2D and 3D similarities
between query ligand and target ligands by the Tanimoto coefficients
in large scale. The background ligand–protein database can
be created by extracting user-interested ligand/cofactor–protein
interactions from the protein data bank (PDB), which includes about
total 14 761 ligand–protein complexes. Alternatively,
the user can download the prebuilt ligand–protein interaction
data set, the PROTEUS data set, from insilab server (http://insilab.org/datasets/) for convenience. The PROTEUS data set was created upon the entire
PDB data. Underlying the ligand-based target search is a database
of known ligand–protein interactions. We converted the ligand
from the PDB format into the MOL2 format using the openbabel.52 Then, we wrote a python script to remove the
redundant ligands from the file. By doing so, we built the nonredundant
relation database between ligand and protein targets. For user convenience,
we deposit the demo package of the method at the GitHub page (https://github.com/haiping1010/LBTS). To be noted, several previous studies utilized the similar ligand-based
target search method in prediction of potential drugs for PDE4 and
PDE5.53 In this study, we chose the PharmMapper
approach, instead of ligand-based target search method, as the component
of the reverse docking pipeline for better illustration.

Target Refinement
by Reverse Docking Using Autodock Vina
We used Autodock Vina54 to simulate ligand–target
interaction in large scale. The simulation starts by selecting the
receptor mass center as the pocket center using the python module
pdb_centermass.py of pdbTools_0.2.1.55 We
set a large cavity volume space (126 Å in x, y, z dimension) as the pocket space. The
simulation was initialized by converting the input PDB file format
to PDBQT file format using the AutoDockTools.56 The exhaustiveness was set to 8, the num_modes was set to 9, and
the energy_range was set to 3. We adopted the default scoring function
and optimization algorithm of Autodock Vina, which have been well
discussed in a previous article.54 The
simulation eventually outputted a list of ligand–protein interactions
in a descending order of binding affinity. In this study, we selected
the most likely targets for further validation by setting a binding
energy threshold value of −8.5 kcal/mol. The choice of the
proper threshold value is a tradeoff between true positive rate and
precisions. In our case, we only focus on the potential targets that
can bind with the acquired ligand with relatively high affinity. If
the cutoff is very low (such as −6 kcal/mol), then the precisions
would be very low, many nonbinding protein targets will be chosen
incorrectly. While if the cutoff is very high (such as −10
kcal/mol), the true positive rate would be low, and many binding protein
targets will not be identified.

It should be noted that the
docking method can be used to do the reverse-docking on all available
PDB structures without the import from PharmMapper. There are more
than 30 000 human proteins deposited in the PDB database. It
would take about 3–4 days to finish all of the blind docking
with ∼60 CPU cores. If we only focus on the disease-related
therapeutic target (about 2000–3000), it would be completed
within 1 day by this reverse docking with 10–20 CPU cores.
Also, if we focus on the adverse drug reaction (about several hundred),
the time that is needed to finish the reverse docking would be shorter.
Thus, the pipeline can be flexible without the importing from pharmMapper.

Prediction of Protein Targets for Herb Ingredients Using the
Computational Pipeline
Acquisition of Herb Ingredients
In this study, we used
three herb ingredients acteoside, quercetin, and EGCG as examples
for pipeline evaluation. Acteoside is a bioactive ingredient of traditional
chinese medicine (TCM) drug Herba Cistanches. It also often exists
in the species of the Lamiales order.57 Acteoside has several pharmacological properties including being
antioxidant, immunosuppressive, and anti-inflammatory.58 Quercetin is a widely distributed flavonoid
in nature; its potential applications include but are not limited
to anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-asthmatic.17 EGCG is a type of catechin.59 EGCG is a major active component in green tea and has potential
therapeutic activity in many disorders such as cancer and chronic
fatigue syndrome.18 We retrieved structures
of these three herbal ingredients from the PubChem database.60 Before further use, we converted the downloaded
*.sdf files to *.pdb format by the UCSF Chimera.61

Prediction of Ingredient Targets
We submitted the three
herbal ingredients to the PharmMapper server for PDB wide target prediction,
achieving a list of 300 potential targets for each ingredient. We
downloaded protein structures from the PDB database. We cleaned the
structures by removal of cocrystalized ligands and addition of hydrogen
bonds using the VMD62 or the UCSF chimera61 via TCL or python scripts, respectively. Then,
we simulated the ingredient–receptor binding by docking each
ingredient against the predefined pockets of the potential protein
pool using Autodock Vina. The reverse docking process took about 24
h of computational time under a Linux system with seven CPU cores
(1064 Hz/core) for each ingredient. The outcome of docking simulation
was a list of PDB IDs, sorted in descending order of binding affinity.

Refinement of Ingredient Targets by Classical MDs
To
further refine the ingredient–target interactions for accurate
complex conformation, we carried out MD simulation using the Gromacs
program with AMBER-14SB force field.63,64 In this study,
we selected three binding complexes for MD simulation as examples:
NOS2 (PDBID 4nos) with acteoside, PDE5A (PDBID 2h44) with quercetin, and WARS (PDBID 1r6t) with EGCG. The
starting protein structures were downloaded from the PDB structure
database.65 The topology of ligand was
generated by ACPYPE,66 which relies on
Antechamber.67 The partial charges of ligand
were calculated with R.E.D development sever using the Gaussian method.68,69 First, we created a cubic box and put the ligand–receptor
complex at the center. A minimum distance from the protein to box
edge was set to 1 nm. We filled the cubic box with TIP3P water molecules70 (the numbers of water molecules are 42 271,
18 513, 27 676, respectively) and then added counter
ions (the numbers of sodium ions are 1, 4, 3, respectively) to neutralize
the total charge using the Gromacs program tool.71 Eventually, the three systems contained 140 399,
60 885 and 89 260 total atoms, respectively. We used
the particle mesh Ewald method72 for calculation
of electrostatic interactions under the periodic boundary conditions.
A cutoff of 14 Å was set in quantifying van der Waals nonbonded
interactions. Covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained
by applying the LINCS algorithm.73 We performed
the MD simulation with parameters of 50 000 energy minimization
steps with a step-size of 0.01 nm, 100 ps simulation with isothermal–isovolumetric
ensemble (NVT), and 100 ps simulation with an isothermal–isobaric
ensemble (NPT) for water equilibrium. This was followed
by a 100 ns NPT production run (step size 2 fs) with
initial velocities from the previous NPT equilibrium
step. The Parrinello–Rahman barostat and modified Berendsen
thermostat were used for simulation with a fixed temperature of 308
K and a pressure of 1 atm. For each of the three complexes, we demonstrated
two replicated simulations with random initial velocities to check
the robustness of MD. We measured the rmsd of final protein conformations
of two MD replicates. A small rmsd value indicates the robustness
of the MD simulation. Although MD simulation is expensive compared
with docking, it is still much cheaper than experimental validation.
The MD simulation can also be conveniently carried out on this academic
free webserver (http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/MDWeb/).74
