In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) determined
by
a neuro-evolutionary approach combining differential evolution (DE)
and clonal selection (CS) are applied for estimating interfacial tension
(IFT) in water-based binary and ternary systems at high pressures.
To develop the optimal model, a total of 576 sets of experimental
data for water-based binary and ternary systems at high pressures
were acquired. The IFT was modeled as a function of different independent
parameters including pressure, temperature, density difference, and
various components of the system. The results (total mean absolute
error of 3.34% and a coefficient of correlation of 0.999) suggest
that our model outperforms other habitual models on the ability to
predict IFT, leading to a more accurate estimation of this important
feature of the gas mixing/water systems.

Introduction
The interfacial tension (IFT) is a parameter
defined for fluids
in pure and mixed conditions, and in addition to the surface of the
fluid, it depends on the soluble mass. These properties of fluids
cause their outer layer to act as elastic sheets, which can lead to
the adhesion of two levels of fluid.1 The
IFT plays an important role in processes such as extraction, distillation,
absorption, heat transfer in welding conditions, and mass transfer
during extraction.2

Although IFT
measurements are of interest, measuring it in a laboratory
setup requires an expensive experimental device and a complex interpretation
method. Therefore, it is important to apply a reliable method that
provides an accurate estimate of IFTs. So far, many efforts have been
made to predict the IFT of pure mixtures and fluids based on statistical
thermodynamics, including the parachor method,3−5 the corresponding
states principle,6,7 perturbation theory,8,9 density functional theory,10,11 and gradient theory.2,12−14 However, it was proven that some precise mathematical
models are able to predict IFT with higher accuracy than conventional
methods.15,16 Therefore, the necessity of using accurate
mathematical models to predict the IFT of different types of fluids
is undeniable. A significant number of previous studies were devoted
to the modeling of IFT between H2O and other compounds
in binary and ternary systems; an overview of these studies is presented
in Table 1.

The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is a
good alternative
to conventional methods of IFT prediction.15,36−38 ANNs are flexible computing tools inspired by the
behavior of biological neurons.39 They
are organized in a layered structure (called network architecture)
formed of artificial neurons. The type of activation function for
the neurons and the way in which they are interconnected indicate
the type of network. Distinctively from other classical approaches
commonly used in modeling, ANNs require a training procedure. In the
current work, feed-forward multilayer perceptron ANNs trained and
determined by differential evolution (DE) and clonal selection (CS)
are used. DE is an efficient evolutionary algorithm inspired by the
Darwinian principle of evolution, and CS is an optimization procedure
simulating the response of the vertebrate immune system when attacked
by pathogens. Simple, hybridized with other optimizers, or in combination
with ANNs, these algorithms were successfully applied to solve a wide
variety of problems.40 Examples from the
chemical engineering area include prediction of conversion rates and
molecular weights of polymerization processes,41,42 removal of toxic compounds,43−46 pharmaceutical freeze-drying modeling and monitorization,47,48 thermal characteristics of PVC/clay nanocomposite foams,49 protein secondary structure prediction,50 and design of optimally loaded supercavitating
hydrofoils.51

Based on the advantages
that ANN can bring, the focus of this work
is on accurately and efficiently predicting IFT from the available
literature. Thus, the necessity of performing complex and difficult
laboratory experiments is reduced. For this purpose, a series of 576
IFT data for different water-based binary and ternary systems were
extracted from the literature18,22,31,35,52,53 and used to determine IFT as a function
of pressure, temperature, density difference, and various components
of the system being modeled. To the authors knowledge, this is the
first study about tackling the issue of IFT prediction in water-based
binary and ternary systems using ANNs determined by a neuro-evolutionary
approach combining DE and CS.

Study Framework
Database
To model the IFT in water-based binary and
ternary systems at high pressures, the available literature was investigated.
The search was carried out on Google Scholar, Web of Science, ACS,
RSC, Scopus, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and Springer Link, and 41 articles
were identified with the search words “interfacial tensions”,
“IFT”, “binary system”, and “ternary
system”. After a careful analysis of the published materials,
a set of binary and ternary systems containing water were identified,
and the experimental conditions under which the IFT was measured,
collected, and processed were obtained. Table 2 presents a summary of the gathered data
that were further used for modeling purposes. The supplementary Excel
file (Table S1) contains the total experimental
data employed in this work.

Modeling Procedure
In this work, the models were determined
based on a neuro-evolutive technique that combines ANNs with DE and
CS. ANNs represent the model of the process and the role of DE and
CS was to determine the optimal architecture (number of layers and
number of neurons in each layer) and the optimal parameters (weights,
biases and type of activation function for each neuron). Although
inspired from different sources, both DE and CS have a similar structure:
a population of potential solutions is updated/evolved (though a series
of steps) until a stop criterion is reached. In this work, for both
DE and CS, the stop criterion is represented by the number of iterations
reaching a prespecified value.

The main difference between the
two algorithms is represented by the steps used to evolve the individuals
in the population. In addition, while the population of DE is fixed,
the CS population varies depending on the number of cloned solutions
added and on the number of weak individuals eliminated. The strongness
of the individuals is measured by a function which in the DE case
is named the fitness function and in the CS case the affinity function.
As it represents the same aspect and it is implemented using the same
relation (eq 1), it will
be further referred to as the fitness function. 1  where MSEtrain represents the mean
squared error computed in the ANN training phase.

The steps
used by DE to evolve the individuals are mutation, crossover,
and selection. In the mutation phase, a mutation operator is applied
to each individual to generate a mutated one. In the crossover phase,
characteristics from the parents (current and mutated individuals)
are combined to form a child. All of the generated children form the
trial population. In the selection phase, the trial population is
compared with the current one and the individuals with the best fitness
are selected to form the new generation. The mutation variant used
in the current DE version is rand/2 (2 differential terms with the
base vector randomly chosen) and the crossover version is binomial.
To eliminate the need for manually setting the control parameters
(that direct the magnitude and direction of search), an auto-adaptation
approach is employed.

The steps used by CS to evolve the individuals
are selection, cloning,
hypermutation, and receptor editing. In the selection step, the best n individuals are selected to be cloned. After that, the
selected individuals are cloned several times (set based on the parameters
of the algorithm). In the hypermutation step, some parameters (genes)
are mutated. This introduces new genetic material and creates diversity.
In the reception editing phase, the worst solutions are removed and
a set of newly generated individuals is added to the population.

To raise the quality of the initial solutions, the optimizers start
with, and after the individuals are randomly generated, the opposition
based principle is applied.54 In the current
approach, the individuals represent ANNs in an encoded form. The encoding
is necessary to transform the ANN into a structure that the optimizers
can work with: vector with real numbers. In this work, a direct encoding,
where a one-to-one mapping between the genotype (individual) and phenotype
(ANN) exists, is applied.

Distinctively from other approaches,
where multiple optimizers
are included in the neuro-evolutive process, in this work, the algorithms
are run in the serial mode. First, DE is applied to determine a set
of solutions. After that, the best solution is selected and it is
used as a starting point for the CS algorithm. In this manner, CS
performs a local search around a single solution and not around multiple
solutions as it would happen when it is included in the DE algorithm
(hybridization). Figure 1 presents a general schema of the overall modeling approach.

Figure 1 General schema
of the neuro-evolutive approach.

To model the considered process, the main important
characteristics
of the systems must be identified and included as inputs. The independent
variables of the process are pressure, temperature, and density difference.
As the gathered data included both binary and ternary systems with
various components (H2O, CO2, H2,
N2, CH4) and in various proportions, additional
inputs for the ANN were added. In all of the systems, the aqueous
phase is represented by H2O,and therefore, this information
is not included in the model. As a result, only the information about
the gaseous phase was added (substance type and quantity).

After
that, all of the gathered data was processed (normalized,
randomized and split into groups) to be included in the neuro-evolutive
approach. The normalization step was based on the min–max approach55 and has the role of scaling all of the features
and speeding up the training time. The randomization implies setting
a random order for all of the data so that the training and testing
are applied on randomly chosen points. From the available data (576
points), 75% were selected for training and the rest (25%) for testing.

DE and CS optimizations are procedures that simulate the natural
processes by using random numbers. Therefore, a set of 25 simulations
were performed with each algorithm. The settings used for the DE algorithm
are as follows: number of iterations: 500, number of individuals in
the population: 40 and for CS, number of iterations: 100, number of
individuals in the population: 20, number of clones for each individual:
10, percent of newly added individuals: 10, mutation factor: 80. For
DE, the control parameters are automatically adjusted using a self-adaptive
procedure. Regarding the ANN, the following limits were imposed: the
maximum number of hidden layers: 2, the maximum number of neurons
in each hidden layer: 20. All of these parameters were set based on
a series of preliminary tests.

Results
The statistics of the simulations performed
with the proposed approach
are listed in Table 3, where the architecture is indicated using the following notation

The mean absolute error (MAE) computed from the testing
data for
the best solution is 5.34% (in the case of DE) and 3.34% (in the case
of CS). This indicates that CS was able to perform a good local search
and to improve the DE intermediary solution. A point-by-point comparison between the experimental data and
outputs generated by DE and CS solutions for a small set of testing
data (25 points) is given in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Point-by-point comparison between the experimental data
and the
outputs generated by the DE and CS solutions for 25 testing points.

As can be observed, there are very small differences
between the
experimental data and the values generated by the ANN found by the
CS algorithm. Due to the flexibility of the ANN model and its generalization
capabilities, it can be efficiently used to determine IFT for a variety
of binary and ternary systems containing water. The mathematical relations
describing the ANN are represented by eqs 2–15. These equations
can be used to predict IFT for any conditions considered as inputs
in the model. Although the ANN has a good generalization capability,
the error of the predictions (in comparison with the real experimental
values) depends on whether an interpolation or extrapolation is performed.
In the case of interpolation (when the inputs values are in the same
interval as the training data), the error is similar to the reported
testing error. In the case of extrapolation (when the input values
are outside the interval of the training data), the predictions are
prone to higher errors. 2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15  In eqs 2–5, the CO2_value,

indicate the quantity of each compound in the system. The sum of all
of the quantities for these compounds must be 1.22

Discussion
Given that the coefficient of interaction
in binary and ternary
systems is dependent on temperature, it is necessary to investigate
IFT at various temperatures. For this purpose, different isotherms
have been measured in binary and ternary systems in the range of pressures
0.5–45 MPa. The results for the binary and ternary systems
are displayed in Figures 3–8. The relative
standard deviation (σ(γ)/γ) of the IFT at each instance
was 0.3%; in all instances, it was <0.9%. Generally, the relative
uncertainty of IFT of all instances is 0.8%, and the relative uncertainty
for combining all instances at 95% confidence is 1.7%. As shown in Figures 3–8, the IFT for all binary and ternary studied systems
is reduced as the temperature and pressure increase. These results
agree with previous studies of binary and ternary systems,56−58 and the developed ANN model accurately predicts this behavior. For
the (H2O + CO2) system, in the stuides by Chiquet
et al. (2007), Kvamme et al. (2007), Georgiadis et al. (2010), and
Chow et al. (2016), a sudden change in gradient is observed and this
is due to IFT dependence on pressure,27 the aspect which is fully gathered by the current model that accurately
predicts this change in gradient.

The dependence of pressure, temperature, and IFT
of the (CH4 + N2) + H2O system is
relatively simple.
At constant gas composition and temperature, the reduction of IFT
by increasing the pressure with different slopes at all pressures
can be observed. At constant gas composition and pressure, the IFT
decreases by increasing the temperature. At constant pressure and
temperature, increasing the methane content results in the reduction
of IFT18 and the current model accurately
captures this behavior. The current model also accurately predicts
the dependence of IFT on component concentration in ternary systems.
At constant pressure and temperature, enhancing the carbon dioxide
and nitrogen content leads to IFT reduction so that this behavior
is properly predicted by the model. Also, the current model accurately
predicts the complex temperature and pressure dependence of ternary
systems with high CO2 concentration.

The MAE between
the experimental data and the outputs of the determined
ANN model (described by eqs 2–15) is 3.34% for all of the
576 instances; this aspect can also be observed from Figures 3–8, and the model closely follows the experimental data. Table 4 summarizes the IFT values using
empirical and ANN models in this study and previous studies. As can
be seen, compared with previous studies, the current ANN generates
more accurate IFT values. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
ANN model is able to describe IFT in water-based binary and ternary
systems with various components. One of the main advantages of the
proposed model is simplicity and lower parameters compared to other
models. For example, Georgiadis et al.22 employed more than one model to express the dependence of pressure
on the temperature in the (H2O + CO2) system,
while in the present study, one model is used for predicting the dependence
of pressure on temperature in the mentioned system and in the other
systems studied. In addition, the current model considers a greater
variety than other models because it can cover a wide range of variables,
systems, and components.

Conclusions
An optimal ANN determined using DE and
CS algorithms is proposed
for the IFT determination of water-based systems. A total amount of
576 IFT values for 15 water-based binary and ternary systems at high
pressure were considered for correlating the pressure, temperature,
density difference, and various components of the system with IFT.
75% of the data was employed for training the ANN and 25% for testing
the predictive ability of the model. This chosen model can predict
the data with a MAE of 3.34% and a coefficient of correlation of 0.999.
The results indicate that the determined model is a very accurate
tool that can correlate the IFT of a wide variety of compounds such
as CO2, H2, N2, and CH4 in a wide range of pressure, temperature, and density difference
values.
