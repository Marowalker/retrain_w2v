Poly(glycerol sebacate)
(PGS) has increasingly become a desirable
biomaterial due to its elastic mechanical properties, biodegradability,
and biocompatibility. Here, we report microfibrous core–shell
mats of polycaprolactone (PCL)–PGS prepared using wet–wet
coaxial electrospinning. The anticoagulant heparin was immobilized
onto the surface of these electrospun fiber mats, and they were evaluated
for their chemical, mechanical, and biological properties. The core–shell
structure of PCL–PGS provided tunable degradation and mechanical
properties. The slowly degrading PCL provided structural integrity,
and the fast degrading PGS component increased fiber elasticity. Young’s
modulus of PCL–PGS ranged from 5.6 to 15.7 MPa. The ultimate
tensile stress ranged from 2.0 to 2.9 MPa, and these fibers showed
elongation from 290 to 900%. The addition of PGS and grafting of heparin
improved the attachment and proliferation of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells. Core–shell PCL–PGS fibers demonstrate
improved performance as three-dimensional fibrous mats for potential
tissue-engineering applications.

Introduction
The engineering of
biomimetic three-dimensional scaffolds requires
the precise design of tissue-engineering elements beyond the physical
space where cells can attach, proliferate, and migrate. Engineered
scaffolds should have adequate mechanical properties to withstand
the forces acting on a tissue or an organ; thus, the choice of materials,
processing methods, and chemical structure play a major role. The
materials used must also be biocompatible to avoid an adverse immunological
reaction and to facilitate seamless progression of healing and regeneration.
Biodegradability and its rate are also essential design components.
The ideal scaffold should degrade at a rate similar to the healing
rate of the tissue or organ.1−4

Electrospinning has been used extensively for
various biomedical
applications. Synthetic, natural polymers, and their blends have been
used in electrospinning, wherein fibers are spun into woven or nonwoven
three-dimensional scaffolds. Electrospinning allows for a controlled
design of the fiber size from micro to nanofibers, fiber alignment,
control of pore size and porosity, and the use of monofilament and
coaxial fiber structures, with the encapsulation of various agents
(cells, growth factors, small molecules, nanoparticles, etc.). Post-electrospinning
modification of fibers relying on fiber surface chemistry
allows for immobilization and further functionalization of electrospun
scaffolds to promote tissue regeneration and repair.5−10 Both wet–dry and wet–wet electrospinning techniques
can be implemented. Wet–dry electrospinning relies on a volatile
solvent that evaporates during the electrospinning process, leaving
dry polymeric fibers at the collecting plate, whereas in wet–wet
electrospinning, the fibers are collected in a coagulation bath that
is miscible with the spinning solvent but does not dissolve the polymer.
Wet–wet electrospinning also permits the use of nonvolatile
solvents in the electrospinning process.11,12

Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) was initially designed for soft
tissue
engineering due to this polymers’ excellent recovery from deformation.13−17 PGS is a synthetic biocompatible elastomer that can be easily synthesized
from glycerol and sebacic acid and degrades by surface erosion.13,18,19 However, PGS prepolymer has low
viscosity, and thus an additional chemical or physical process is
needed to cure this polymer into solid materials. In one study, acrylated
PGS was used with PEO followed by cross-linking,20 whereas another study used thermal curing of PGS and poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) blends to prepare core–shell nanofibers.21 Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a semicrystalline
and aliphatic polyester that degrades slowly in vivo by either chemical
hydrolysis of its ester bonds to caproic acid and its oligomers or
through enzymatic hydrolyosis.22−24 The high tensile strength, good
elongation properties, excellent biocompatibility, and ease of chemical
and physical modification has made PCL useful for a wide range of
biomedical applications.23,25 PCL and PGS have been
combined as blends and as core–shell microfibers. Elastomeric
microfibers of nonacrylated PGS were fabricated using wet–dry
electrospinning by blending with PCL to increase the viscosity of
PGS.26 This study demonstrated that the
addition of PGS to PCL improved the utility of microfibers for the
growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Recently, Masoumi et al.27 fabricated aligned PGS/PCL
microfibers to induce human aortic VIC’s
proliferation and maturation. Moreover, a study combining electrospinning
with soft lithography was used to fabricate PGS/PCL electrospun patterned
fibers to mimic the complex anisotropic and multiscale architecture
of a cardiac tissue.27

In this study,
for the first time, core–shell fiber mats
of PCL–PGS were prepared using wet–wet coaxial electrospinning
without chemically or physically curing PGS.

Heparin, a widely
used polysaccharide-based anticoagulant drug,
was immobilized on the surface of the resulting PCL–PGS mats.28,29 We hypothesized that wet–wet coaxial electrospinning would
facilitate the fabrication of PCL–PGS microfibers and that
the resulting core–shell fibers would provide structural properties
that resembled those of a natural extracellular matrix of a wide range
of tissues and organs, depending on the PCL–PGS combination
used. Heparin was also used to enhance surface properties of PCL–PGS
mats and thus allow better cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration.
The core–shell structure should also allow the encapsulation
of cells, growth factors, and small molecules to guide the regeneration
process.

Materials and Methods
Materials
PGS prepolymer was synthesized
on the basis
of previous reports’ processes.27,30 Briefly, 1:1
molar ratio of sebacic acid and glycerol were reacted at 120 °C
under high vacuum (≈50 mTorr) for 24 h. Polycaprolactone (PCL,
MW 80 000), 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), hexamethylenediamine,
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl amino propyl) carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS), tributylamine, and isopropanol were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri). Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs), endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2), and bullet kit
were purchased from Lonza (MD). Lyophilized United States Pharmacopeia
(USP) heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa was obtained from Celsus
Laboratories Inc (Cincinnati, OH). Heparan sulfate (HS) disaccharide
standards (Table S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)) were purchased from
Iduron (Manchester, U.K.). High-performance liquid chromatography
grade ammonium acetate, calcium chloride, acetic acid, and acetonitrile
were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Springfield, New Jersey). Escherichia coli expression and purification of the
recombinant Flavobacterium heparinum heparin lyase I–III (Enzyme Commission (EC) #s 4.2.2.7, 4.2.2.X,
4.2.2.8) were performed in our laboratory, as previously described.
BIOPHEN Heparin Anti-IIa and Anti-Xa kits were purchased from ANIARA
Diagnostica (West Chester, OH).

Fabrication of PCL–PGS
Mats
PCL–PGS core–shell
solutions were prepared by dissolving 13% (w/v) PCL in the TFE solution
as the shell solution and 0, 40, 60, 80% (w/v) PGS in TFE as the core
solution. The shell and core solutions were then mechanically stirred
using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature to form homogeneous solutions.
The core–shell fibers were fabricated, as previously described,31 using a coelectrospinning process with a coaxial
spinneret (MECC, Ogori, Fukuoka, Japan). The diameter of the inner
needle and outer needle were 0.94 and 2.50 mm, respectively. The distance
between the spinneret tip and aluminum collector electrode was fixed
at 15 cm. The flow rates of the shell and core solutions were 180
and 30 μL/min, respectively. After electrospinning core–shell
fibers, the weight percent (wt %) of 13% PCL–0% PGS (w/v) core–shell
fiber was 100%, 13% PCL–40% PGS (w/v) was 66.1% PCL and 33.9%
PGS, 13% PCL–60% PGS (w/v) was 56.5% PCL and 43.5% PGS, and
13% PCL–80% PGS (w/v) was 49.4% PCL and 50.6% PGS. The PCL–PGS
mixture solutions were used as controls. Mixture fibers were prepared
by dissolving 13% (w/v) PCL in a TFE solution and mechanically stirred
using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature to form homogeneous solutions.
The corresponding weight percent (wt %) of PGS was then added into
the PCL solution, as in core–shell fibers (0, 40, 60, and 80%).
The mixture solution of PCL and PGS was placed into a 10 mL syringe
and connected to the spinneret (MECC, Ogori, Fukuoka, Japan). The
internal diameter of the needle was 0.94 mm. The distance between
the spinneret tip and the aluminum collector electrode was fixed at
15 cm. The electrospinning solution was fed at 30 μL/min. The
scaffolds were marked with 13PCL, 13PCL–m-40PGS, 13PCL–m-60PGS,
and 13PCL–m-80PGS, respectively. The applied voltage for both
core–shell and mixture fibers was optimized at 15 kV. All electrospun
fibers were collected into a water coagulation bath to remove TFE,
washed with water, and freeze-dried under vacuum.

Fiber Mat Characterization
For morphological evolution
of fiber mats, a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)
(FEI–Versa, Hillsboro) was used. For SEM observation, the samples
were sputter-coated by a thin layer of gold and palladium. Prior to
cross-sectioning, the mats were immersed in liquid nitrogen. The presence
of PCL and PGS was confirmed by a Bruker D8-discover X-ray diffractometer
using graphite-monochromated Cu Kα radiation. Thermal properties
of PGS–PCL scaffolds were determined using a differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC) 8500 (Perkin-Elmer). Preweighted scaffolds were
sealed in aluminum pans and were heated at 10 °C min–1. The samples were then subjected to six heating and cooling cycles
between −80 and 100 °C under nitrogen condition. The presence
of heparin was confirmed by its enzymatic digestion, followed by disaccharide
analysis using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
(Agilent 6300 Ion Trap LC/MS Systems; CA). The LC separation was achieved
using an Agilent Poroshell 120, EC-C18 column, (2.1 mm × 100
mm, 2.7 mm) at 55 °C on the Agilent 1200 LC system. The full-scan
(200–900 Da) MS analysis was under negative ionization mode,
with a skimmer voltage of −40.0 V, a capillary exit of −40.0
V, and a source temperature of 350 °C. Liquid nitrogen was used
as the drying and nebulizing gas at a flow rate of 8 L/min and a pressure
of 40 psi, respectively. Data analysis was performed using Agilent
ChemSolution software.

Mechanical Properties
For mechanical
measurements of
the electrospun mats, a uniaxial elongation test was performed using
an Instron 5800 (Plansee, Franklin, MA) load frame with
a 100 N load cell. Specimens were cut to a rectangular shape (15 mm
× 5 mm × 0.3 mm, n = 3); the crosshead
speed was set constant at 10 mm/min during the uniaxial test. Young’s
modulus was calculated from the 0–15% strain region in the
stress–strain curve. Ultimate strength (UTS) and ultimate elongation
were measured from the highest peak of the stress–strain curve.

Degradation Analysis
Electrospun mats were cut into
15 mm × 5 mm × 0.2 mm rectangular strips and subjected to
accelerated degradation (n = 3) by incubation in
5 mL of 1 mM NaOH solution at 37 °C for different time periods
(2, 4, 8, and 12 days). After incubation at each degradation time
point, the scaffolds were washed gently with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.4) and water and then freeze-dried under vacuum. The degraded
sample was weighed (Wt), and the sample
percentage mass loss calculated as ((WoWt)/Wo ×
100) on the basis of the initial mass (Wo) of each sample before incubation.

Covalent Immobilization
of Heparin on PCL–PGS Mats
A previously described
method was used to introduce amine groups
onto 13PCL–80PGS core–shell mats.28 Briefly, 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.2 mm mats were immersed
into 10% (w/v) 1,6-hexanediamine solution prepared in isopropanol
for 3 h at room temperature. Then, the aminolyzed mats were washed
in deionized water for 48 h and freeze-dried under vacuum. The amine
groups containing 13PCL–m-80PGS mixture-fiber mats were incubated
with 300 mg of EDC and 450 mg of NHS in the presence of 10 mL of 30
mg/mL heparin solution in 10 mL of deionized water and kept at room
temperature for 24 h to obtain heparin-immobilized 13PCL–m-80PGS
mats. After the reaction, the fiber mat was washed with 1% Triton-X
100 aqueous solution and deionized water several times and freeze-dried
under vacuum.

Procedures of Anti-IIa and Anti-Xa Assays
The 13PCL–80PGS
core–shell fibers with surface-immobilized heparin were thoroughly
washed with water to remove all leachable heparin prior to measuring
anti-IIa and anti-Xa activities. The wells without mats were used
as blank controls. Briefly, heparinized mats and nonheparinized fiber
mats (∼2.5 mg, n = 3) were placed in a 96-well
plate. All samples and reagents were preincubated at 37 °C for
10 min. The fiber mats were mixed with reagent 1 from the BIOPHEN
kits to start the assay at 37 °C. Reagents 2 and 3 and 20% acetic
acid were added at 2, 4, and 5 min for anti-IIa and 6 min for anti-Xa.
The absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a plate reader (Spectramax
M5, MD). All samples and blanks were determined in triplicate. For
calculations, the mean of blank A405 was
subtracted from the mean of each sample.

In Vitro Cell Culture Evaluation
HUVECs were cultured
in EBM-2 supplemented with growth factor kit and maintained at 37
°C and 5% CO2. Prior to cell seeding, the scaffolds
were cut into 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.2 cm and sterilized in
70% ethanol for 10 min, followed by 10 min of UV exposure. HUVEC cells
were seeded at 150 000 cells per mat. The cells were allowed
to attach for 1 h; then, 200 μL of fresh medium was added
to each well. The WST-1 cell proliferation assay kit was used according
to the manufacturer’s instructions to quantitatively evaluate
proliferation on seeded mats (n = 5), (Cayman, MI).
Cells seeded on tissue culture plates (TCPs) served as the control.
At predetermined time points (1, 3, 5, and 10 days), the medium was
removed, samples washed with PBS twice to remove unattached cells,
100 μL of fresh medium was added, and then 10 μL of WST-1
solution was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The medium
(100 μL) was then transferred to a 96-well plate and absorbance
was measured at 450 nm. For cell attachment and cell spreading observations,
seeded mats were fixed with 70% ethanol overnight and then observed
using FE-SEM at each predetermined time point.

Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as mean
values ± standard deviations (SD). Statistical analysis was performed
using the statistical software Origin 8.0. Significant differences
between groups were measured using a t-test, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results and Discussion
Three-dimensional PCL–PGS
structures have already been widely
used in various tissue-engineering applications. PGS is an elastomeric
polymer that has great potential in improving physical and chemical
properties of scaffolds but presents challenges due to its low viscosity
and the need for curing to solid polymer. PCL can provide for improved
stability when added to PGS fibers. Electrospinning for the preparation
of PGS and PCL composite fibers relied on both wet–wet monofilaments
(Figure 1) and wet–wet
coaxial electrospinning.31 The mass fractions
of PCL and PGS present in the mixture fibers and core–shell
fibers are shown in Table 1.

fibers: 13PCL (100%), 13PCL–m-40PGS, 13PCL–m-60PGS,
and 13PCL–m-80PGS.

The morphology of electrospun mats composed of mixture fibers and
core–shell fibers was determined using scanning electron microscopy
(Figure 2). Both mixture
and core–shell fibers exhibited uniform and smooth surface
morphology. The anticipated fiber structure for core–shell
and monofilament fibers could be observed. The cross section of core–shell
fiber mats shows two distinct layers of the PCL shell and PGS core,
whereas that of the mixture in the monofilament fiber mats shows only
a single layer. The mean diameter of fibers was calculated using 30
different regions of each mat; the diameter varied depending on the
PGS content and electrospinning technique (Figure 3a). The diameter of the mixture fibers of
13PCL alone was 520 nm, as PGS was added (13PCL–m-40PGS, 13PCL–m-60PGS,
and 13PCL–m-80PGS) the diameter did not change significantly,
as follows: 1.10, 1.13, and 1.10 μm, respectively. However,
when examining core–shell fibers, the diameter significantly
increased as PGS content increased. We found that the diameter of
13PCL–0PGS was 1.55 μm, whereas that of 13PCL–40PGS,
13PCL–60PGS, and 13PCL–80PGS was 3.09, 4.42, and 5.54
μm, respectively.

(h) 13PCL–60PGS, and (i) 13PCL–80PGS).

DSC was used to determine the thermal properties
of the electrospun
PCL–PGS mats. The relevant thermograms of the PCL–PGS
fibers with different blend ratios are shown in Figure 3b. The thermograms exhibit a main melting
peak at Tm = 57.8 °C, which is consistent
with PCL. The melting temperature (Tm)
of pure PGS was calculated to be 12.4 °C. Notably, electrospun
mats of both core–shell and mixture fibers exhibited two distinct Tm, indicating presences of both PGS and PCL
within the blended mats. The presence of two distinct peaks indicates
that PGS and PCL are not fully miscible and phase separation might
occur after the electrospinning process. On increasing the PGS blend
ratio, the main melting peak shifted slightly to lower temperature.
The crystallinity of the blend fibers is known to decrease with an
increasing PGS/PCL blend ratio; the PGS prepolymer is fully amorphous
above 35 °C. Thus, increasing the PGS content of the blend nanofiber
causes a decrease in crystallinity of the fibers. It should be pointed
out that low crystallinity is extremely important for good elasticity
and biodegradability of a potential implant material.

The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern of the PGS prepolymer exhibits
two peaks at 19 and 23 °C. Although the signals are rather weak,
this is quite remarkable as the prepolymer is generally thought to
be an amorphous polymer. In the case of the PCL-only fibers, two peaks
are observed at 21 and 23 °C. The XRD patterns of the blend fibers
are summarized in Figure 3c. The patterns exhibit three peaks, which constitute the
two major peaks of the PCL spectrum and a peak at 2Θ = 19 °C,
which can be assigned to the PGS portion. The presence of heparin
was confirmed by its enzymatic digestion, followed by disaccharide
analysis using LC/MS. Results show (Figure S1, SI section) that heparin is externally
accessible in all electrospun mats. However, fibers containing PGS
showed higher heparin peak intensity compared to that of fibers containing
PCL alone. A standard for heparin peak intensity and compositions
are included in the SI section (Figure S1 and Table S1, respectively).

Stress–strain curves for all ratios of the core–shell
and mixture mats were next examined. In the mixture-fiber mats (Figure 4c), the addition
of PGS resulted in a significant increase in the ultimate tensile
strength (UTS). Young’s modulus and extension had very little
to no changes (Figure 4b,d, respectively). In contrast, the addition of PGS in the core–shell
fibers resulted in a significant increase in Young’s modulus
extension (Figure 4b,d, respectively). Addition of PGS resulted in the decrease of UTS
in the core–shell fiber mats. The stress–strain curves
(Figure 4a) showed
a small linear region followed by a significant deformation of the
core–shell mats. Fiber morphology and diameter also play an
important role in the mechanical properties of electrospun mats (Figure 2). The addition of
different PGS ratios had no effect on the fiber diameter in the mixture
mats; thus, Young’s modulus and elongation did not change significantly.
However, a different trend was observed in core–shell mats;
with the PGS ratio increase, the fiber diameter increased and this
resulted in an increase in Young’s modulus and extension.

and (h) 13PCL–80PGS).

The degradation of mixture and core–shell mats showed
linear
degradation profiles for both the PCL and PCL–PGS mats (Figure 5). Under accelerated
conditions for 12 days, PCL-only mats showed a 15.7% mass loss, whereas
the mixture mats (13PCL–m-80PGS) showed a higher degradation
rate with a 45.9% mass loss and the core–shell mats (13PCL–80PGS)
showed a 26.3% mass loss. Previous in vivo studies reported PGS implants
of having a linear 70% mass loss within 35 days,19 whereas PCL implants degraded slowly over more than 2 years,
depending on the polymer molecular weight.32 In an accelerated degradation study of PCL scaffolds using 5 M NaOH,
a mass loss of about 15% was reported in 1 week.33

(b) 13PCL–80PGS, and (c) 13PCL in 1 mM NaOH. Error bars represent
the standard deviation.

The anticoagulant activities of the core–shell and
mixture
mats, with and without surface-bound heparin, were examined using
anti-Factor Xa and anti-Factor IIa assays (SI, Table S2). These amydolytic assays measure
the ability of heparin on the surface of the fiber to inhibit the
blood coagulation cascade proteases Factor IIa (thrombin) and Factor
Xa. In this assay, if heparin is present on the fiber it binds to
antithrombin, a serine protease inhibitor, which inactivates either
Factor IIa or Factor Xa, preventing them to act on their
amidolytic substrate to afford a colored product, p-nitrophenol. The core–shell 13PCL–80PGS–heparin
and the mixture mat 13PCL–m-80PGS–heparin fibers, when
present in the reaction media, completely inhibited color formation,
confirming that active heparin anticoagulant was present on the surface
of these fibers.

HUVECs were seeded on mixture and core–shell
mats and cultured
for 1, 3, 5, and 10 days. A quantitative analysis of cell attachment
by the WST-1 assay is shown in Figure 6. All mats showed good cell metabolic activity. By
day 3, the heparinized mixture and core–shell mats showed significantly
higher cell activity than that of nonheparinized mats. This trend
continued through day 10. HUVEC cells grown on tissue culture plates
were used as a positive control. Heparinized PCL-alone mats showed
slight increase in cell activity compared to that of nonheparinized
PCL-alone mats. The difference in cell activity was much more pronounced
when heparinized fiber mats contained PGS. As in previous studies,
the PCL–PGS mats supported the viability, attachment, proliferation,
and spreading of various types of cells, including those of HUVECs.
Electrospun PCL has a hydrophobic surface due to the lack of functional
groups and thus does not promote cell adhesion. The addition of PGS
decreases the contact angle and hydrophobicity of PCL, leading to
enhanced cell attachment and spreading.26 The heparin immobilized on the surface is capable of interacting
with a great number of proteins related to cell adhesion, proliferation,
or osteogenic differentiation.34

Conclusions
In this study, core–shell fibers of PCL
(shell) and PGS
(core) were prepared using wet–wet coaxial electrospinning.
Then, the heparin was immobilized on the surface of the PCL/PGS scaffold.
Fabricated scaffolds were evaluated for their chemical, mechanical,
and biological properties. The core–shell structure of PCL
with PGS allows controlled degradation of the scaffold. Slowly degrading
PCL will provide structural integrity and mechanical support, whereas
the fast degrading PGS component will increase the elasticity, maintaining
the mechanical properties of the tissue-engineered construct. The
PGS–PCL scaffolds showed tunable mechanical properties so that
Young’s modulus changed from 5.56 to 15.7 MPa, ultimate tensile
stress changed from 2.04 to 2.91 MPa, and elongation changed from
291 to 907%. The addition of PGS and the grafting of heparin improved
cell attachment and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs). The scaffolds provide the potential applications in
tissue engineering.
