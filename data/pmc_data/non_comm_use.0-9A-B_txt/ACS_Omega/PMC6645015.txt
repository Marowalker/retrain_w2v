Herein,
we improved the performance of Si/graphite (Si/C) composite
anodes by introducing a highly adhesive co-polyimide (P84) binder
and investigated the relationship between their electrochemical and
adhesion properties using the 90° peel test and a surface and
interfacial cutting analysis system. Compared to those of conventional
poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF)-based electrodes, the cycling performance
and rate capability of P84-based Si/C anodes were improved by 47.0%
(372 vs 547 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles at a 60 mA
g–1 discharge condition) and 33.4% (359 vs 479 mAh
g–1 after 70 cycles at a 3.0 A g–1 discharge condition), respectively. Importantly, the P84-based electrodes
exhibited less pronounced morphological changes and a smaller total
cell resistance after cycling than the PVdF-based ones, also showing
better interlayer adhesion (Fmid) and
interfacial adhesion to Cu current collectors (Finter).

Introduction
The progressing fossil
fuel depletion and global climate change
pose a serious threat to humankind, thus requiring internationally
coordinated efforts and attention. Electric vehicles (EVs) and energy
storage systems (ESS’s) have gained tremendous attention as
one of the promising greenhouse gasses solution.1−3

However,
the successful implementation of EVs and ESS’s
relies on high-energy-density battery systems. Although lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) based on carbon anode materials (graphite, 372 mAh
g–1 for LiC6) and transition-metal-oxide
cathode materials (e.g., lithium cobalt oxide, LiCoO2)
have been commercialized to power mobile electrical devices, their
current energy density is still too low to satisfy the high-level
requirements of large-scale applications such as EVs and ESS’s.

Although silicon has received much attention as a promising anode
material due to its high theoretical energy density (4200 mAh g–1 for Li22Si5 or Li4.4Si), environmental friendliness, and low cost,4−8 it has not been successfully implemented in commercialized
LIBs because of suffering from large volume changes (>300%) during
alloying and dealloying. Moreover, the stresses accompanying these
changes cause mechanical failure and result in severely degraded electrochemical
performances of Si electrodes.

Consequently, Si/graphite (Si/C)
composite anodes (Si/C anodes),
wherein Si constitutes only a portion of the active material, have
been proposed as an alternative to pure Si anodes.9,10 This
approach exhibits certain advantages because even if the theoretical
anode capacity increases infinitely, the total theoretical capacity
of the battery soon reaches saturation because of the limited theoretical
capacity of the cathode.11

We have
recently succeeded in enhancing the performance of Si-based
anodes by using mussel-inspired and co-polyimide-based adhesive polymeric
binders, hierarchical Si composites, adhesive Cu current collectors,
and adhesive conductive additives.4,5,12,13 Still, the demand for
battery-suitable high-loading Si/C-based anodes requires further progress
in this direction. However, as shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information), the importance of active material
loading in Si/C anodes has been underestimated by current studies.

P84 is a highly adhesive, soluble, and thermally stable co-polyimide-based
binder, exhibiting outstanding intrinsic properties compared to those
of conventional polymeric binders and thus improving the performances
of battery constituents (anodes, cathodes, and separators), enhancing
the cycling performances of Si-based anodes and the high-temperature
electrochemical performances of cathode materials and increasing the
thermal stability of LIBs that contain layers of ceramic composite
separators.7,14−16

Herein,
we used P84 in high-loading Si/C-based anodes (∼4.0
mg cm–2) and investigated their electrochemical
and mechanical properties. Specifically, electrochemical properties
such as electrochemical stability, cycling performance, rate capability,
and impedance were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and alternating
current impedance spectroscopy, with the corresponding data recorded
using a battery cycler. The mechanical properties of the above anodes
were evaluated using the 90° peel test and a surface and interfacial
cutting analysis system (SAICAS).

Result and Discussion
The uniformity of Si/C anodes was characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX). Figure 1 shows
that the electrode surface featured uniformly distributed microsized
graphite particles, with the gaps between them filled by nanosized
Si, confirming that Si/C anodes exhibited good surface uniformity.

Figure 1 (a) SEM
image of the P84-based Si/C anode surface and (b) EDX elemental
mapping relevant to (a) (blue = Si, red = C).

PVdF- and P84-based Si/C anodes were precycled, and the obtained
results were compared. As depicted in Figure 2, P84-based Si/C showed a higher discharge
capacity than that of PVdF-based Si/C (P84-based Si/C: 900.6 mAh g–1 for charging and 602.5 mAh g–1 for
discharging; PVdF-based Si/C: 658.7 mAh g–1 for
charging and 523.8 mAh g–1 for discharging). In
contrast, the former electrode exhibited a lower Coulombic efficiency
than that of the latter one (66.9 vs 79.5%, respectively), which seemed
to be closely related to the irreversibility of the reduction reaction,
as is discussed below.

Figure 2 Potential profiles of P84- and PVdF-based Si/C anodes
recorded
during precycling.

Electrochemical stabilities
were probed by CV, with both electrodes
showing almost identical profiles from open circuit voltage (OCV)
to 0.9 V vs Li/Li+, whereas P84-based Si/C exhibited a
more intense reduction peak below 0.9 V vs Li/Li+ (Figure 3). As suggested in
previous studies, this behavior is related to the intrinsic properties
of imide-based polymeric materials, i.e., the C=O groups of
the imide ring in P84 react with Li+ during charging.7,17 Interestingly, P84-based Si/C showed a stronger oxidation peak than
that of PVdF-based Si/C. The above results were in good agreement
with those of previous precycling tests relevant to Figure 1, revealing that P84-based
Si/C showed higher discharge and charge capacities than those of PVdF-based
Si/C and implying that the irreversible reduction reaction played
a positive role in Si/C anodes.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of P84-
and PVdF-based Si/C anodes
recorded at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1.

CV profiles of PVdF-based Si/C anodes and P84-based
Si/C anodes
at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th scans were drawn and compared. As shown
in Figure 3, the magnitude
of the current peaks increased with cycling due to activation of more
material to react with Li in each scan.18 Furthermore, the first scan shown in Figure 3 differs from those due to a “formation”
effect, corresponding to the filming of the electrode during the first
Li discharging.

For graphite anodes, the main reactions are
believed to be the
solvated Li intercalation (at potentials from ∼0.8 to ∼0.2
V vs Li/Li+) and the reversible formation of subsequent
stages of LixC6 (at potentials
from ∼0.2 to ∼0.005 V vs Li/Li+).19 The stepped voltage profile of Si can be observed
in a high-temperature experiment (415 °C) to form four intermediate
equilibrium phases. In contrast, at a mild temperature (25 °C),
lithiation shows a single gradually sloping plateau (∼0.1 V
vs Li/Li+) and large hysteresis between lithiation and
delithiation.20 This is because the lithiation
process results in the formation of a metastable amorphous LixSi phase instead of the equilibrium intermetallic
compounds.20 Considering the overlapping
voltage plateau region of graphite (∼0.2 to ∼0.005 V
vs Li/Li+) and Si (∼0.1 V vs Li/Li+)
during lithiation, delithiation voltage plateau should be carefully
considered to distinguish the role of each active material.

As depicted in Figure 4, the P84-based Si/C anodes showed two overlapping peaks at
∼0.27 and ∼0.32 V and a broad shoulder peak at ∼0.5
V during charging (delithiation) until the 20th scan. In contrast,
PVdF-based Si/C showed a peak shape similar to that of the P84-based
Si/C anodes up to the 5th scan and showed a single peak at ∼0.27
V without the ∼0.5 V wide shoulder peak from the next scan.
Considering the fact that the PVdF-based Si/C showed a rapid capacity
decrease due to Si pulverization (Figure 5), a long-lasting single peak at ∼0.27
V corresponds to graphite, whereas the other peaks at ∼0.32
and ∼0.5 V correspond to Si. The peak characteristics of Si
are in good agreement with those in the previous study.21

Figure 4 CV profiles of (a) P84-based Si/C anodes and (b) PVdF-based
Si/C
anodes during 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th scans recorded at a scan rate
of 0.1 mV s–1.

Figure 5 Electrochemical performances of P84- and PVdF-based Si/C anodes:
(a) cycling performance (charge rate = 60 mA g–1, discharge rate = 60 mA g–1). (b) Rate capabilities
determined by varying the discharge rate from 60 mA g–1 to 3.0 A g–1 while maintaining the charging rate
at 60 mA g–1.

Subsequently, we investigated the effect of polymeric binders
on
the cycling performance and rate capability of Si/C anodes.

As shown in Figure 5a, P84-based Si/C showed better cycling performance than that of
PVdF-based Si/C, with the respective capacity retentions after 100
cycles equaling 93 and 72% (P84-based Si/C: initial discharge capacity
= 586 mAh g–1, discharge capacity at 100th cycle
= 547 mAh g–1; PVdF-based Si/C: initial discharge
capacity = 511 mAh g–1, discharge capacity at 100th
cycle = 372 mAh g–1). Furthermore, P84-based Si/C
exhibited a capacity retention of 88% after 200 cycles (Figure S1, Supporting Information; discharge
capacity at 200th cycle = 516 mAh g–1).

Furthermore,
we investigated the cycling performance of P84-based
Si/C anodes at different active material loadings and current densities
(Figure S2, Supporting Information), revealing
that the electrode with the lowest loading (1.0 mg cm–2) showed the best performance during high-current-density charging
(0.3 A g–1). In contrast, Si/C anodes with the highest
loading (4.0 mg cm–2) showed poor cycling performance
and a low discharge capacity of ∼400 mAh g–1. As depicted in Figure 5a, a low current density (60 mA g–1) was
required for the high-loading Si/C anodes (4.0 mg cm–2) to achieve a discharge capacity (∼600 mAh g–1) exceeding that of graphite (372 mAh g–1). Considering
the importance of high-loading anodes (Table S1, Supporting Information) and the fact that long-term ESS’s
utilize charging at a rate of C/12, one can infer that the high-loading
P84-based Si/C systems with a stable cycling performance and high
discharge capacity (Figure 5a, charging rate = C/10) are suitable for practical applications.22,23

As shown in Figure 5b, P84-based Si/C showed a better rate capability than that
of PVdF-based
Si/C, with the above electrodes maintaining 81 and 70% of the initial
discharge capacity, respectively, after 70 cycles at 5C (P84-based
Si/C: initial discharge capacity = 586 mAh g–1,
discharge capacity at 70th cycle = 479 mAh g–1;
PVdF-based Si/C: initial discharge capacity = 511 mAh g–1, discharge capacity at 70th cycle = 359 mAh g–1).

After precycling, the interfacial resistances of unit cells
comprising
P84-based and PVdF-based Si/C anodes were measured and compared. In
general, the total cell resistance (Rtotal) comprises bulk resistance (Rb), solid–electrolyte
interphase (SEI) resistance (RSEI), and
charge transfer resistance (Rct), i.e., Rtotal = Rb + RSEI + Rct.24−26 To explore the origin of electrochemical properties of LIB cells
in practice, Rtotal should be closely
monitored because, in general, the LIB cells having smaller Rtotal revealed the improved rate capability
and cycle performance.16,26−31 As shown in Figure 6, we fitted the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results using
an equivalent-circuit model based on the fact that the SEI was composed
of multiple layers.32 The unique feature
of this model is the separation of (1) all Ohmic resistant components
lumping into R1 and (2) Faradaic nonlinear
components into the R2, R3, and R4. To be more specific, R1, (R2 + R3), and R4 represent Rb, RSEI, and Rct, respectively. The calculated resistance
is listed in Table S1. The Rtotal of P84-based Si/C cells was much smaller than that
of PVdF-based Si/C cells, in agreement with the improved cycling performance
and rate capability of the former electrodes. Taking this into account,
it can be inferred that P84 effectively prevents Si pulverization
and produces thin SEI layers with a smaller resistance.

Figure 6 Impedance spectra
of unit cells containing P84- and PVdF-based
Si/C anodes after precycling.

As shown in Figure 7, the initial morphologies of PVdF- and P84-based Si/C anodes
were
different due to the inherent differences in the physical and chemical
properties of constituent polymeric binders. However, the above anodes
showed opposite surface morphology changes after cycling, i.e., cycled
PVdF-based Si/C anodes featured larger numbers of deep big cracks
than those in pristine ones, whereas cycled P84-based Si/C anodes
exhibited less surface cracks than those in pristine ones. Because
newly formed cracks consume large electrolyte amounts for SEI formation
on the fresh active material surface and form dead active Si materials,
cracking can decrease electrode capacity and increase interfacial
resistance during cycling,33,34 in agreement with our
previous experimental results discussed above.

of (a–d) P84-based Si/C anodes
and (e–h) PVdF-based Si/C anodes before and after the 10th
cycle relevant to Figure 5a.

Adhesion inside electrode composites
as well as between the electrode
composite and current collectors significantly affects the electrode
cycling performance.35−38 To investigate the effect of polymeric binder type on the adhesion
properties of Si/C, they were evaluated using the 90° peel test
and SAICAS.

As shown in Figure 8a, P84- and PVdF-based Si/C anodes showed typical adhesion
strength
profiles, with the former showing a higher adhesion strength than
that of the latter (0.0594 and 0.0346 kN m–1, respectively).5,8 On the basis of Griffith’s theory of cracking, however, the
material fracture is originated due to the presence of microscopic
flaws in the bulk material, i.e., if microscopic flaws are present
in the material, the fracture stress increases and the materials can
be easily fractured and/or torn apart in spite of the inherent mechanical
strength.39 That is, the adhesion strength
measured by the peel test cannot represent the adhesion properties
of the Si/C anodes properly. In view of the above, the specific adhesion
properties of Si/C anodes were evaluated using SAICAS.

Figure 8 (a) Adhesion strength
profiles of P84- and PVdF-based Si/C anodes

(Finter) and (c) interlayer adhesion strength
(Fmid, measured at 15 μm from the
surface) of P84- and PVdF-based Si/C anodes. (d) Finter of P84- and PVdF-based Si/C anodes after 10 cycles
relevant to Figure 5a.

SAICAS allows one to determine
the adhesion properties of Si/C
anodes at a specific position by adjusting the blade depth relative
to the electrode surface. For convenience, the interlayer adhesion
(Fmid) in Si/C composites was measured
at 15 μm from the surface, with the interfacial adhesion between
Si/C composites and Cu current collectors denoted Finter.

As depicted in Figure 7b,c, P84-based Si/C anodes (Fmid = 0.2422 ± 0.01 kN m–1, Finter = 0.2728 ± 0.004 kN m–1)
showed better adhesion properties than those of PVdF-based Si/C anodes
(Fmid = 0.2214 ± 0.02 kN m–1, Finter = 0.2214 ± 0.001 kN m–1).

After cycling performance tests relevant
to Figure 5a, both
anodes were disassembled after 10
cycles and their Finter values were measured
and compared. In both cases, Finter decreased
after cycling, with this decrease being less pronounced for P84-based
Si/C (92.9% of the initial Finter value,
from 0.2728 ± 0.004 to 0.2534 ± 0.01 kN m–1) than for PVdF-based Si/C anodes (83.7% of the initial Finter value, from 0.2214 ± 0.001 to 0.1854 ±
0.01 kN m–1). This result is closely related to
the larger mechanical strength of P84, which is less prone to swelling
than PVdF.6,17

Thus, SAICAS-determined adhesion properties
revealed that the firm
interlayer adhesion of the Si/C anode composite and its interfacial
adhesion to Cu current collectors contributed to its enhanced performance.

Conclusions
Herein, we showed that highly adhesive and soluble co-polyimide
polymeric binders (e.g., P84) can improve the electrochemical properties
of Si/C anodes such as cycling performance and rate capabilities,
additionally facilitating the anode preparation process. Because of
the inherent physical properties of P84, P84-based Si/C anodes showed
better adhesion properties (Fmid and Finter) and less pronounced adhesion decrease
upon cycling than those of PVdF-based Si/C ones, which resulted in
the enhanced cycling performances and rate capabilities of the former
electrodes. Moreover, P84 diminished the severe morphological changes
induced by charging/discharging and achieved a smaller total cell
resistance after cycling.

Experimental Section
Electrode Preparation
Si/C anodes were prepared by
coating a slurry of 5 wt % Si (30–50 nm, Nanostructured &
Amorphous Materials), 75 wt % graphite (CGB-20, Nippon Graphite, Japan),
10 wt % conductive carbon (Super-P Li, IMERYS, Switzerland), and 10
wt % polymeric binder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP,
Sigma-Aldrich) onto Cu current collector foil (11 μm, Iljin
Materials, Republic of Korea) using a doctor blade technique. Two
polymeric binders were used, namely, PVdF (Mw = 350 000, KF-1300, Kureha Battery Materials Co.,
Japan) and P84 (Mw = 150 000, HP
Polymer GmbH, Germany) dissolved in NMP. The cast slurry was dried
in air at 80 °C for 2 h and roll-pressed using a gap-control-type
roll-pressing machine (CLP-2025, CIS, Republic of Korea). The loading
and thickness of Si/C anodes were controlled as ∼4 mg cm–2 and 30 μm in both cases.

Morphological
Analysis of Si/C Anodes
The elemental
distributions and surface morphologies of the prepared electrodes
were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (MIRA
LMH, TESCAN and FE-SEM, S4800, Hitachi) coupled with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; Genesis XM2, EDAX Inc.).

Cell Assembly
Si/C anodes were cut into disks (diameter
= 12 mm) and assembled into 2032-type coin half-cells using Li metal
(thickness = 200 μm, diameter = 16.2 mm; Honjo Metal Co., Japan)
as the counter electrode. Polyethylene separators (thickness = 20
μm, diameter = 18 mm; ND420, Asahi Kasei) were employed, and
1.15 M lithium hexafluorophosphate in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate
(3:7, v/v) containing 5 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate (ENCHEM, Republic
of Korea) was used as an electrolyte. Cell assembly was conducted
in an argon-filled glove box with a dew point below −60 °C.

Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical properties
of Si/C anodes were probed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using an impedance
analyzer (VSP, Bio-Logic). The prepared 2032-type unit cells (Si/C
half-cell) were scanned at a rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in
a potential range of 0.005–1.5 V vs Li/Li+, starting
from the open circuit voltage (OCV).

The assembled cells were
aged for 12 h and then cycled between 0.005 and 1.5 V in constant
current mode at a rate of 0.06 A g–1 and 25 °C
in both charge and discharge modes using a charge/discharge cycler
(PNE Solution, Republic of Korea).

After the above cycling,
the total cell impedance was measured
using an impedance analyzer (VSP, Bio-Logic) in a frequency range
of 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz.

To evaluate the cycling performance, cells
were subjected to 100
cycles at a current density of 0.06 A g–1 at 25
°C. Furthermore, to evaluate rate capabilities, the discharge
current densities were varied from 0.06 to 3 A g–1, with the charging current density maintained at 0.06 A g–1.

90° Peel Test
A 20 mm × 20 mm anode sample
was attached to 3 M adhesive tape, and peel strength was measured
using a micro material tester (Instron 5848, Instron Company). The
adhesive tape was removed by peeling at an angle of 90° and a
constant displacement rate of 10 mm min–1, with
the applied load being continuously measured to construct force/displacement
plots.

SAICAS Measurements
The interlayer adhesion of the
Si/C composite (Fmid) and the interfacial
adhesion between Si/C anodes and Cu current collectors (Finter) were characterized by SAICAS (Daipla Wintes Co.,
Ltd.) utilizing a 1 mm wide boron nitride blade fixed at a shear angle
of 45°. For measuring Fmid, the blade
was positioned 15 μm from the anode surface. During the test,
the blade moved in the horizontal direction at 0.2 μm s–1, maintaining a vertical force of 0.2 N.
