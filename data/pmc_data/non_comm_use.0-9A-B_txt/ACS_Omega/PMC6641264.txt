Here,
we present how replacing the usual inorganic counter ion
with a pharmaceutically active aromatic one can greatly affect the
interfacial as well as bulk properties of ionic liquids (ILs). We
have synthesized a series of novel drug-based ILs, namely, 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium
diclofenate ([Cnmim][DF]; n = 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) abbreviated as DF-ILs, wherein DF– is a well-recognized analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug. We show strong synergistic interactions between Cnmim+ and aromatic DF– attributed to reduced electrostatic repulsions and increased hydrophobicity
from their incorporation, reflecting a 300-fold smaller critical aggregation
concentration than that of their Cl– analogue [Cnmim][Cl]. Interfacial properties for such strongly
associating systems are discussed and clearly established to have
remarkably improved properties than those of their Cl– analogues. The decreasing polarity of the cybotactic region of pyrene
with increase in the chain length “n”
indicates an increased extent of packing of cationic head groups in
the Stern layer. DF– ion seems to play a vital role
in the formation of the resulting aggregates, as probed by small angle
neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The thermodynamical
insights of the aggregation process have been studied using isothermal
titration calorimetry and temperature-dependent conductivity experiments.
Unilamellar vesicles are formed at extremely low concentration, and
also it is the first report that puts into picture the formation of
vesicles for [C6mim][DF] with such a short chain.

1 Introduction
The
interest in ionic liquids (ILs) from past decades is motivated
by their environment friendly alternative to traditional organic solvents
due to their extraordinary physiochemical properties, such as high
conductivity, low vapor pressure, thermal stability, wide potential
window, liquid–liquid extraction.1−3 From the first reported
IL, there is growing interest in improving the properties of ILs by
fine-tuning of the head group, variation of the counter ion, as well
as fictionalization of the hydrophobic part preparing ILs with enhanced
properties over those of conventional ionic surfactants.4−9 A large amount of work is reported in the area of ILs, documenting
their remarkable improved properties and still sparking a considerable
interest.10−15 Since then, ILs emerge into three generations classified according
to their specific properties and characteristics.16,17

ILs in first generation are well documented with their unique
physical
properties, such as decreased vapor pressure and high thermal stability.18 Progressing to the next stage that is called
the second generation of ILs will be by retaining the core desired
features, with modified properties produced by both physical and chemical
alterations.19−21 In this regard, various surface-active ILs having
different cations, such as morpholinium, pyridinium, imidazolium,
pyrolidinium, nicotine, and amino acids, have been extensively studied
to explore their interfacial and micellar behavior.4,11,18,22−26 However, the ILs having imidazolium cation, [Cnmim]+ are being more broadly explored for their
behavior.4−8,11,13,18 In this regard, aggregation behavior of
the series of ILs [Cnmim][Cl] and [Cnmim][Br] with n = 4–12
have been well reported in aqueous medium using various techniques.7,27,28 The aggregation of [C4mim][BF4] is well reported, although it is having too
short an alkyl chain to exhibit micellization, which is a good achievement
in this field.22,29 Rao et al. characterized the
surfactant properties of a new class of ILs having hydrophobic amino
acid counter ion and dodecylsulphate as anion, which is called amino
acid ILs (AAILs), using conductivity, surface tension (ST), fluorescence,
transmission electron microscope (TEM), and dynamic light scattering
(DLS).5 The properties of AAILs are reported
to be superior to those of conventional surfactants with similar alkyl
chains, and their aggregation behavior was suggested to be altered
depending upon the type of amino acids governed by entropic parameters.
On similar lines, recently Singh et al. have synthesized, characterized,
and investigated the self-assembly behavior of new ester-functionalized
surface active ILs based on nicotine [CnENic][Br] (n = 8, 10, and 12), with bromide counter-ions.15 These ILs are found to have lower critical micellar
concentration (cmc) than that of homologous ILs or conventional cationic
surfactants and also reported to be noncytotoxic toward C6 glioma
cell line for their possible deployment in diverse biomedical applications.

Heading toward the next generation, third generation ILs have been
explored for their biological activity and broadening their applicability
as potentially valid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).16,30−33 Solid forms of APIs are often known to suffer from poor solubility,
and also polymorphic conversion influences their therapeutic effects.11 APIs with IL properties (API-ILs) are largely
discussed in the above stated context and have been proven to have
the highlighted advantages.30,34−36 Thus, it is important to design novel API-ILs having pharmaceutical
importance and also to study their physiochemical properties in detail.
As far as we know, there are only few reports on the development of
novel API-ILs, with their detailed micellar and interfacial behavior.
In this regard, Viau et al. synthesized and investigated the micellization
behavior of [Cnmim]+ (n = 4, 6, and 8) and ibuprofenate anion in their aqueous
solutions, using ST, conductivity, NMR self-diffusion, and DLS techniques.34 In their later study, they also studied the
aggregate structures using DLS, cryogenic-TEM, 1H NMR measurements,
and atom-scale molecular dynamics simulations.35 Recently, the IL transdermal system has been developed
for the treatment of pain and inflammation, for which nonclinical
and clinical results showed the safety and tolerability of the product,
proving to be a great success in this field.37

Although API-ILs have potential of a very promising pharmaceutical
strategy, various aspects, such as toxicity and biodegradability of
ILs, are yet to be considered.38 The environmental
fate of ILs is now opening doors to expand the number of studies on
toxicity and biodegradability of ILs. In some cases, imidazolium-based
ILs (used in the present study) were also reported to be toxic; however,
at the same time, these ILs were also verified to have remarkable
inhibitory results, such as low concentrations of C16mimCl
that strongly inhibited growth of multidrug-resistant Candida tropicalis. Gathergood et al.39 proposed that toxicity is significantly reduced
with the insertion of an oxygen atom in the side chains of the imidazolium
cation and enhances primary biodegradability.40 Despite the fact that cytotoxicity increases with the elongation
of the alkyl chain some exceptions were also reported.41,42 Moreover, the physical and chemical (lipophilic and/or unstable
nature) characteristics of anions that constitute IL-API also influence
the cytotoxicity.43 Costa and his co-workers
evaluated bioassays on the basis of inhibition of human carboxylesterase
2 and Vibrio fischeri to judge the
ecotoxicity of some selected IL-APIs.44 Interesting results were drawn; accordingly, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
salicylate may be considered practically harmless, although it is
slightly toxic than its starting material; benzalkonium salicylate
and cetylpyridinium salicylate were slightly toxic.44 Thus, by exchanging the inorganic anion with one having
pharmaceutically active species may result in decrease of cytotoxicity
of employed ILs. Both cation and anion structures play an important
role in determining the toxicity, and future studies (including our
own research group) now involve the cytotoxicity study of IL-API,
which is to be used in higher stages of drug development.

In
the case of micelles, vesicles, bilayers, and so forth, transformation
among these various self-assembled structures upon exchanging the
inorganic counter ion by pharmaceutically important ions have also
been a wide area of research.4,6,30,34−36 Vesicles gained
much importance due to their widespread applications in drug–gene
delivery, bioseparation, sensitivity for cosmetic industry and nanostructured
systems, and sensing.45 However, because
of their ease of preparation, long-term stability, low cost, and ease
of storage, catanionic vesicles are well deployed in the pharmaceutical
industry.46 However, to date, toxicity
as well as low entrapment efficiency of catanionic vesicles greatly
limit their further possibility in the field of the drug-delivery
system.45 Therefore, it is of great interest
to minimize toxicity, enhance the entrapment efficiency, and lessen
the tedious chemical synthesis so as to discover an excellent drug-delivery
application.45 Here, we have synthesized
the highly viscous prodrug liquid by simple mixing of an equimolar
amount of diclofenac sodium salt (DFNa) and 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium
chloride in butanol by removing NaCl with filtration. By this method,
we have synthesized a series of novel DF-ILs (Scheme 1), namely, 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium diclofenate
([Cnmim][DF]; n = 6,
8, 10, 12, and 14), wherein DF– is a well-recognized
analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Scheme 1 Structure
of DF-ILs, [Cnmim][DF]
Thus, the property of ILs can be fine-tuned
for their use as API
simply by replacing inorganic anions (Cl–, Br–, BF4–, etc.) with anions
having pharmaceutical importance. The motive of the present work is
to investigate the effect of DF– on the micellization
and aggregation behavior of imidazolium-based cations. Another fundamental
interest of this study lies in the fact that substitution of DF– may affect micellization and structure of resulting
aggregates. It is also interesting to compare the properties of synthesized
ILs with those of other reported homologous amphiphilic ILs [Cnmim][Cl]. However, their pharmaceutical potential
is yet to be discovered and will constitute a part of our future studies.

The interfacial behavior of [Cnmim][DF]; n = 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, has been largely discussed in
terms of various parameters, such as ST at critical aggregation concentration
(cac), that is, γcac, adsorption efficiency (pC20), the ST reduction effectiveness (Πcmc), saturation adsorption (Γmax), and minimum
surface area per molecule (Amin). The
improved properties of these DF-ILs by comparing with [Cnmim][Cl] have also been highlighted. The degree of
counterion binding (β) and various thermodynamic parameters,
such as standard free energy of aggregation (ΔG°agg), standard enthalpy of aggregation (ΔH°agg), and standard entropy of aggregation
(TΔG°agg)
have been evaluated and discussed using conductivity and isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. Information about micropolarity
using pyrene as probe is provided by steady state fluorescence. Morphology
of the formed unilamellar vesicles (ULVs) have been well characterized
and discussed using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and TEM
after a preliminary visual inspection and turbidity measurements.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Micellization: cac
The micellization
of synthesized DF-ILs was studied by ST (γ), conductivity, and
fluorescence measurements. The change in γ as a function of
DF-IL concentration (C) viz. [Cnmim][DF] (n = 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) at
298.15 K is shown in Figure 1. It is observed from Figure 1 that with gradual addition of DF-ILs γ decreases
initially up to a certain concentration and then remains constant.
The initial decrease in γ clearly indicates that DF-IL molecules
are adsorbed at the air/solution interface. A constant value of γ,
regarded as the breakpoint in γ versus C plots,
is referred as cac, confirming the formation of micelles. The absence
of any minimum at the breakpoint just denied the presence of any surface
active impurity in the synthesized DF-ILs.47 Further purity of these DF-ILs was confirmed by high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) and 1H NMR.

Figure 1 Plots of ST (γ)
as a function of concentration (C) of DF-ILs ([Cnmim][DF]) in aqueous
solution at 298.15 K. Inset shows the variation of ln cac versus
number of carbon atom (n) of the alkyl chain of DF-ILs
([Cnmim][DF]).

Similarly, cac values are also obtained from conductivity
and fluorescence
measurements from their obvious changes and are provided in Table 1 together with corresponding
cac values of [Cnmim][Cl] (Cl analogue)
reported elsewhere.8 If we compare their
cac values from Table 1, it is observed that cac values of DF-ILs are much smaller than
those of their corresponding Cl– analogues. Moreover,
the cac values of DF-ILs are even much lower than those of the ILs
associating an aromatic ibuprofenate anion and [Cnmim+; n = 4, 6, 8] cation.34 Thus, we may propose that our newly synthesized
DF-ILs are best in terms of their reduced cac. Further, on considering
the effect of alkyl chain length (n) on cac values,
a linear relationship between ln cac and “n” was observed, as shown in inset of Figure 1. The cac value decreased by a factor of
60 on going from n = 6 to 14, indicating a considerable
enhancement in the spontaneity of aggregation with an increase in
the chain length.5 It is well reported
in the literature that electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
play a vital role in the formation of micelles and vesicles.6,48 The huge decrease in cac values of DF-ILs may be due to the following
two reasons. First, the electrostatic repulsions between positively
charged imidazolium headgroups of Cnmim+ are well screened by negatively charged aromatic diclofenate
(DF–) due to their poor hydration as compared to
that of the heavily hydrated small Cl–. These decreased
electrostatic repulsions enhance adsorption of Cnmim+ at the air/liquid interface before aggregation
as well as facilitate an early formation of aggregates.6 Second, the increased hydrophobicity from the
incorporation of the DF– aromatic group can also
be responsible for decreased cac values. DF– has
a weak tendency to be moved away from the palisade layer of aggregates
because of the hydrophobic effect, which plays a crucial role in promoting
vesicle formation (discussed later on). The explanation of reduced
cac may also be explained on the basis of π–π interaction
owing to the aromatic counter ion DF–. It is also
well established in our previous study that there are strong π–π
stacking interactions between the oppositely charged moieties, contributing
a synergic effect to aggregation.49

Plots of specific conductance (κ)
as a function of DF-IL
concentration (C) at 298.15 K measured by conductivity
are shown in Figure 2, and in these plots, the intersection point is regarded as cac.
Thus, evaluated cac values are found to be in fair agreement with
the values observed from ST (Table 1). The free counter-ions are responsible for the conductivity
of aqueous solution before the formation of aggregates. But when aggregates
are formed after cac, the free counter ions bind at the stern layer
of the aggregates, decreasing the conductivity of the solution. Because
the sensitivity of conductivity depends upon the degree of counter-ion
binding phenomenon, it is unable to depict the cac of [C6mim][DF]. There may be three possible reasons for these observations
(i) there is no aggregation for [C6mim][DF], (ii) even
before micellization, DF– remains partially associated
with C6mim+ due to their ion–pair complex
formation tendency; (iii) extensive hydration of C6mim+ due to its smaller size, which weakens the hydrophobicity
of C6mim+. The absence of aggregation is ruled
out because aggregation is confirmed by SANS and TEM measurements.
Moreover, all of the studied DF-ILs are speculated to form ion–pair
complexes similar to those of C6mim+; however,
they show a sharp break point.

12 in aqueous solution at 298.15 K. Inset shows similar plots for n = 10 and 14 analogue.

2.2 Counter-Ion Binding and Effect of Temperature
The degree of counter-ion binding (β) can be estimated from
electrical conductivity measurements using the equation β =
1 – α. Here, the degree of counter-ion dissociation (α)
can be obtained by Frahm’s method, that is, from the ratio
between the slopes of conductivity curves above and below the cac.
The values of β for DF-ILs at different temperatures are summarized
in Table S1 in Supporting Information.
The β values of DF-ILs are found to be larger than those of
their corresponding Cl– analogues. Because the degree
of hydration of smaller sized Cl– is more as compared
to that of larger aromatic DF–, this in turn weakens
Cl– binding to aggregates. Also, it is worth mentioning
here that β decreases with increasing n in
DF-ILs, which is in accordance to general observations.50

Further, to know the temperature dependence
of cac, it is determined at three different temperatures in the range
298.15–318.15 K, as shown in Figure S1. It can be concluded from the summarized values in Table S1 that cac values decrease with increasing temperature.
Two opposite processes may alter the cac values, the predominant factor
will finally decide the observed trend. First, with increasing temperature,
the hydration degree of DF– may decrease, facilitating
aggregate formation, and this should decrease cac values. Second,
intensification of molecular thermal motion with increasing temperature
may destroy the ordered water structures surrounding the hydrophobic
group which disfavors aggregation and hence increases cac values.
The increase in cac values being dependent on temperature (Table S1) indicate the predominant role of the
first process in aggregation. Moreover, β values are found to
decrease with increasing temperature, reflecting that the stronger
thermal motion of DF– plays a predominant role in
weaker hydration.

2.3 Interfacial Parameters
The capability
of an amphiphile to decrease the ST can be measured by two interfacial
parameters: (i) the efficiency of adsorption at air/solution interface
(pC20) and (ii) the effectiveness of ST
reduction (Πcac). pC20 is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of C20, where C20 stands for the
concentration of amphiphile required to reduce the ST of pure solvent
by 20 mN m–1.51,52 1  As can be seen from Table 2, pC20 values
increases by increasing the alkyl chain length (n), and these higher pC20 values are suggestive
of amphiphiles with higher adsorption efficiency.4 Furthermore, on comparing pC20 values with those of other ILs, it is quite clear that pC20 values are higher for newly synthesized DF-ILs.4−18,22−29,34−36 The higher
pC20 of DF-ILs reveals their enhanced
efficiency to adsorb at the air/solution interface on increasing the
hydrophobicity either by increasing the alkyl chain length or by introducing
aromatic counter ion (DF–). The Πcac, which is known as surface pressure at cac, defined as 2  where γ0 is the ST of double
distilled water and γcac is the ST at cac. The higher
Πcac of DF-ILs than those of their Cl– analogues reflected the changed monolayer composition as well as
compactness in case of the former, confirming that the monolayer at
the air/solution interface not only contains imidazolium cations (Cnmim+) but also Cnmim+DF– ion pairs. Furthermore,
as can be seen from Table 2, γcac of DF-ILs decreased from n = 6 to 14, indicating the greater efficiency of C14mimDF
in reducing ST at the air/solution interface. Moreover, their γcac values are quite lower than those of their Cl– and Br– analogues.7,27,28 Moreover, low γcac values for DF-ILs
represent an interface that is densely packed. This was demonstrated
by estimating the maximum surface excess concentration (Γmax) and the minimum surface area of molecule (Amin) at the air/solution interface. Γmax and Amin are calculated by applying
the Gibbs adsorption isotherm.53 3   4  where
dγ/d ln c is the maximum slope
obtained in the plots of γ
versus log[C]. NA, R, C, and T are Avogadro’s
number, gas constant, concentration of surfactant, and temperature
(K), respectively. The value of “m”
represents the number of solute species whose concentration varies
with the IL’s concentration at the interfacial layer and is
taken as 2. The summarized Γmax values in Table 2 clearly depict that
on increasing n in the [Cnmim][DF] series Γmax values increase and consequently Amin values decrease. This indicates that the
interactions between oppositely charged Cnmim+ and DF– were electrostatic, accompanying
hydrophobic interactions, and indicative of Cnmim+DF– ion pairing under cooperative
interactions. Thus, the synergic effect between the positively charged
imidazolium ring and negatively charged DF– moieties
is resultant from both π–π stacking and electrostatic
attraction, in addition to hydrophobic interactions.49 It is previously reported that DF– intercalated
in the hydrophobic microdomain near the imidazolium ring.49 Because of this penetration of DF–, the electrostatic repulsion between imidazolium rings significantly
screened, resulting in decrease of Amin, that is, increase in the packing of molecules, which in turn leads
to the formation of vesicles (discussed later on).

2.4 Micropolarity: I1/I3 Ratio of Pyrene
To investigate
the microenvironment of the self-assembly, fluorescence studies were
performed using pyrene as an extrinsic fluorescence probe because
pyrene molecules bind preferentially to the hydrophobic region of
the self-assemblies. Relative intensities of the vibronic bands (I1/I3) of pyrene
fluorescence in the aqueous solutions of various DF-ILs as a function
of concentration are plotted in Figure 3. For all of the DF-ILs, the respective I1/I3 ratios remain constant
initially and then decrease rapidly until cac is reached. After cac,
the I1/I3 ratios
again remain almost constant with further increase in the concentration
of DF-ILs. The solubilization of pyrene in hydrophobic regions of
aggregates, as a consequence of aggregation, leads to decrease in I1/I3. The concentration
corresponding to the middle point of the transition is considered
as cac and is provided in Table 1. The obtained values of cac are in good agreement
with those obtained from other methods within limits of the technique
used. The I1/I3 values upon aggregation for different DF-ILs follows the order:
[C14mim][DF] (1.86) > [C12mim][DF] (1.75)
=
[C10mim][DF] (1.75) > [C8mim][DF] (1.49)
≈
[C6mim][DF] (1.46), which indicates the decreasing polarity
of the cybotactic region of pyrene. The cybotactic region is assumed
to be the region around the solute molecule where the ordering of
solvent molecules is modified by the presence of solute and the I1/I3 ratio of pyrene
is very much sensitive to the polarity of cybotactic region.54 The variation can be analyzed in terms of the
increased extent of packing of cationic head groups in the Stern layer
of aggregates while going from [C6mim][DF] to [C14mim][DF]. The observations are in line with variation in the degree
of counter-ion binding (β) for the studied DF-ILs, indicating
the increased compactness of vesicular structures. With increase in
the alkyl chain length, the aggregates become more and more compact
due to greater hydrophobic interaction between DF– and the alkyl chain. The I1/I3 ratio for [C14mimDF] is 1.77, which
is found to be close to that of water (1.86), suggesting that the
pyrene molecules are partly exposed to the bulk; this is only possible
if the probe molecules are solubilized in nonspherical aggregates
like a flat bilayer or highly compact vesicular structures.55 A similar explanation of high I1/I3 values for sodium 2-dodecylnicotinate
was reported by Roy et al.55 Dey et al.
also reported similar kind of results for sodium-N-(11-acrylamidoundecanoyl)-glycinate and l-alaninate.56

plots
for n = 10, 12, and 14 analogue.

2.5 Thermodynamics Properties of Micellization
The standard Gibbs free energy of aggregation ΔG°agg for DF-ILs at different temperatures was calculated
using the following equation51 5  where β, R, T, and Xcac are degree of counter
ion binding, gas constant, temperature, and cac of DF-ILs expressed
in terms of mole fraction, respectively. ΔG°agg is negative at all temperatures, indicating
spontaneity of the processes, and becomes larger with increase in
the alkyl chain length (Table S1). The
hydrophobic forces of attractions between the alkyl chain lengths
increase upon increasing their lengths, which in turn favors the formation
of aggregates. Moreover, the obtained values ΔG°agg for DF-ILs are higher than those of their chloride
analogue, indicating that the process of aggregation is more feasible
in the case of the former.27,57−60 This again justifies the important role of weakly hydrated aromatic
DF– in acceleration of the aggregation process by
increasing the hydrophobicity and at the same time decreasing the
electrostatic repulsion between headgroups as compared to that in
heavily hydrated Cl–. The enthalpy of aggregation
ΔH°agg was calculated by applying
the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation. 6  The obtained ΔH°agg values
are found to be negative for all of the studied
DF-ILs and become more negative with increasing temperature, which
is in accordance with results of conventional ILs/surfactants (Tables S1).61,62 The negative
ΔH°agg indicates that the process
of micellization is exothermic in the investigated temperature range.6 The entropy of aggregation (ΔS°agg) was calculated using the following equation 7  The entropy of aggregation is found to be
positive for all studied temperatures, and its magnitude decreases
with increase in temperature (Table S1).
The aggregation process is mainly driven by entropy initiated by the
highly ordered caged water structure molecules around the IL monomers.
The contribution of entropy toward aggregation decreases upon increasing
the temperature because water molecules become less ordered around
the hydrophobic domain of DF-ILs at higher temperatures.

ITC
is very useful to understand the reorganization of IL monomers into
aggregates, which relies only on determining the heat evolved during
the molecular interaction. ITC, in addition to conductivity, was also
employed to determine cac, ΔG°agg, ΔH°agg, ΔS°agg (Table 3), and the calorimetric titration curves of DF-ILs as a function
of concentration (C) at 298.15 K are presented in Figure 4. The enthalpy changes
in the aqueous IL solution are dependent upon various factors, such
as degree of counterion binding (β), aggregation number (Nagg), and the dilution of micelles.63 However, the enthalpy changes after cmc are
mainly contributed by dilution of added micelle or electrostatic repulsion
between the forming micelles.

The shapes of enthalpy curves reveal
very interesting results:
(i) the first plateau in the enthalpy curve of [Cnmim][DF] (n = 6, 8, and 10) is sloped,
which is more pronouncedly sloped for n = 6, (ii)
whereas the enthalpograms for n = 12 and 14 are relatively
flat; (iii) the second plateau is almost similar and flat in all studied
ILs. In the case of shorter chain ILs, cmc is quite high as a result
of higher concentrations used in the injected solution and so the
behavior of the solution in the sample cell cannot be assumed to be
ideal. Moreover, the enthalpy curves for n = 6 and
8 could be classified as type B; that is, change is less sharp, in
which the micelle–micelle interactions commence to impact the
enthalpy changes.64 The enthalpy curves
for n = 10, 12, and 14 could be classified as type
A, wherein heat changes sharply between the two plateaus.64

The graphical extrapolation method is
adopted, as mentioned elsewhere,
to obtain ΔH°agg and cac values.17 Thus, the obtained cac values are used in eq 5 to evaluate ΔG°agg, and these values are used in the
Gibbs–Helmholtz equation to calculate ΔS°agg. The evaluated ΔG°agg values are in accordance with those observed from conductivity
measurements; however, ΔH°agg obtained from conductivity and ITC techniques differed in magnitude.
The difference arises due to contribution of a different physiochemical
process other than that of the aggregation in the ITC experiment involving
enthalpy change.65 Although ΔH°agg values differ in magnitude, their
variation trend is similar. The variation of β with increase
in n [Cnmim][DF] follows
the reverse order to that of enthalpy change. This indicates that
the enthalpy changes are not controlled only by the screening of electrostatic
repulsions between ionic head groups which are known to give rise
to exothermic changes. Thus, possible π–π interactions
between DF– ion and the Cnmim+ head group and also hydrophobic interactions due
to hydrophobic nature of DF governs the total enthalpy change. As
observed from Table 3, aggregation of studied DF-ILs is an entropy-driven phenomenon because
of its greater contribution to the variation in ΔG°agg.

3 Morphology: Size and Shape
of Aggregates
3.1 Phase Behavior by Visual
Inspection and Turbidity
Measurements
In conventional ILs (first generation), the
counter ion bound at the stern layer cationic micelles and reduced
the electrostatic repulsions among the surfactant headgroup thus facilitating
the aggregation. Exchanging the heavily hydrated small inorganic ions
(Cl– and Na+) with the poorly hydrated
aromatic diclofenate (DF–) may endow an additional
π–π stacking interaction between the imidazolium
headgroup and diclofenate rings. Owing to the synergistic interactions
already discussed, we may expect that the morphology of resulting
aggregates of the DF-ILs should be different from that of chloride
analogues. First, we looked upon the phase behavior of the above synthesized
DF-ILs by visual inspection, and the results are further evidenced
by turbidity measurements. Considering this, a series DF-ILs and their
chloride analogues at a concentration 10 times that of cac were prepared
and the typical image sequence for this is shown in Figure 5. It clearly depicts that the
solution of CnmimCl is transparent over
a range of alkyl chain lengths from n = 6 to 14,
whereas the synthesized DF-ILs turn out to be turbid, with a bluish
color arising, which seems to be quite interesting. This infers that
these cloudy solutions may contain larger aggregates, above tens of
nanometers. The vesicles appear to be stable for weeks (no aggregation
within the vesicular solution detectable, as evidenced from visible
inspection). Figure S2 represents the turbidity
versus C curve for the synthesized DF-ILs in aqueous
solution. The characteristic feature of these curves is an abrupt
increase in turbidity as C is increased progressively.
This behavior signalizes aggregation after attaining a particular
concentration corresponding to cac, and these obtained values of cac
are in good agreement with those obtained from other techniques (Table 1). Thus, following
these initial qualitative evaluations, the fine details of these aggregates
were probed by SANS and TEM measurements

representation of structural transitions
of [Cnmim][Cl] to [Cnmim][DF], where n = 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14.

3.2 SANS
Measurements
The SANS scattering
curves for the synthesized DF-ILs at a concentration 10 times that
of cac and their associated fits are shown in Figure 6a.

Figure 6 (a) Representative SANS data patterns and (b)
variation of ULV’s
thickness (t) versus number of carbon atoms (n) of alkyl chain for DF-ILs ([Cnmim][DF], n = 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14).

The absence of any correlation peak and scattering
on a log–log
scale at a low Q range suggested the formation of
ULVs for all of the synthesized DF-ILs in these concentration regions
(Figure 6a). A slope
of −2 on a log–log scale corresponds with the formation
of ULVs. Further, the absence of the multilamellar structure is confirmed
from the fact that scattering data do not show any Bragg peak coming
from the repetition of lamella.49 The thickness
of the vesicles is decided by cutoff in the higher-Q region, and thus evaluated thicknesses of vesicles are plotted and
listed in Figure 6b.
The thickness (t) of the vesicles increases from
1.5 to 3.8 nm, as the alkyl chain length increases from n = 6 to 14. On comparing the Cl– analogues of DF-ILs,
it is found that they form only prolate micelles and not vesicles
even at their much higher concentration than that used in the present
study.29,66 The role of specificity of the counter-ion
interactions with the headgroup of ionic surfactants to generate vesicles
can be better explained in light of Collin’s law.67−69 Cosmotropic ions undergo strong hydration owing to high surface
charge density, whereas the opposite is true for chaotropic ions (weak
hydration). Imidazolium rings of ILs have large surface areas and
thus are regarded as chaotropic. Cl– is assumed
to be cosmotropic due to concentration of negative charge on a small
atom, whereas DF– is considered to be chaotropic
because the charge is localized on a larger aromatic moiety. Thus,
DF– ions may interact with the imidazolium headgroup
more sturdily than Cl– and as a result dehydration
of the head group and the counterion occurs following Collin’s
law. Moreover, DF– has more hydrophobicity, favoring
the strong binding of DF– to the alkyl chain of
Cnmim+ and deep penetration
into the interior of the palisade layer of the ULVs releasing water
molecules. Furthermore, dehydration of the head group and counter
ion during binding decreases the area of headgroup (a) and increases packing parameter (P), facilitating
the vesicle formation.70 Thus, following
this the synthesized DF-ILs result in spontaneous formation of vesicles,
whereas their Cl– analogues are no longer in appropriate
conditions even at higher concentrations to form vesicles.67,68

To facilitate interpretation of the data, the measured bilayer
thickness of the vesicles for each DF-IL given along with the extended
chain length calculated using Tanford’s formula are plotted
in Figure 6b.71 It is clearly depicted from Figure 6b that the measured bilayer
thickness of DF-IL is approximately equal to the double of the fully
extended chain length of Cnmim+. Thus, it may be concluded that the alkyl chains at either end do
not form looped conformations in bilayers of vesicles. In salt free
vesicles (no Na+ and Cl+), DF– is a full-time counter-ion worker deeply penetrated in the bilayer.
The rigidity of DF– appears to prevent looped conformations
and thus promotes a bilayer spanning conformation having thickness
approximately equal to double that of the extended chain length. It
is important to mention here that in our previous study the reported
bilayer thickness of the mixed system of C12mimBr + DFNa
and C14mimBr + DFNa was 1.46 and 1.73 nm, respectively,
even lower than that of the extended chain length of Cnmim+.49 Flexible
ILs, especially long saturated alkyl chains, can form looped conformation
in aggregates.72 So, in a mixed system,
due to the presence of counter-ion Cl– and Na+, the DF– moieties are partially inserted
into the vesicle bilayer and the coiling of the flexible Cnmim+ chain leads to the formation
of looped conformation having smaller thickness. However, in the present
study, exchanging the counter-ion Cl– by DF– (removing Na+ and Cl–) leads to the transformation from prolate micelles to vesicles,
with thickness comparable to the double of that of the extended chain
length of Cnmim+. So, only
exchanging the Cl– with DF– leads
to the spontaneous formation of vesicles at extremely low concentration
and these formed vesicles are also known as salt-free vesicles.

It is also significant to compare ULV bilayer thickness of the
studied ILs with the thickness of other IL mixed systems reported
earlier. In this regard, our own research group monitored the ULV
thickness of ILs using SANS measurements in a mixed system of CnmimCl (where n = 8, 10, and
12) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate (SDBS).73 ULVs are formed in the range of 0.2–0.8 mole fraction
of sodium dodecyl sulfate (XSDBS) at a
total concentration of 100 mM. In each of these studied mixed systems,
the bilayer thickness measured by SANS was found to be quite lower
than the double of that of extended chain lengths of 8, 10, and 12
carbon-atom chains. These results further support the above mentioned
coiling and looping phenomenon; that is, the absence of rigidity in
one component easily leads to looping of chains and results into smaller
“t” values. Interestingly, Thakkar
et al. have examined the aggregation behavior of salt-free catanionic
vesicles of 1-alkyl-3-methyl-imidazoliumoctylsuphate (CnmimC8SO4, where n = 8 and 12), using SANS and the bilayer thickness close to their
corresponding extended chain lengths.74 Further, these results support our hypothesis of full time chain/organic-moiety
counter-ion workers; that is, on removing the inorganic counter-ions,
the shell thickness increases, which is also observed in our present
study. As explored by SANS measurements, [C6mim][DF] surprisingly
forms vesicles even though possessing a very small alkyl chain of
six carbon atoms. It is important to mention here that no studies
have yet reported anything that puts into picture the formation of
vesicles of such short alkyl chains.

3.3 TEM Measurements
The TEM technique
was used to visualize the actual morphology of the aggregates. Figure 7 is a series of TEM
images of aggregates of synthesized DF-ILs at a concentration two
times that of cac.Moreover, the high-resolution TEM images are provided
in Figure S3. The aggregates were confirmed
to be vesicles by observing a void likely enveloped with a bilayer
in the case of all of the studied ILs. Torn bilayers can be observed
in Figure 7, leaving
a hole on the vesicles. This was presumably caused by the evaporation
of encapsulated water upon drying the samples. Vesicles are first
assembled in an ordered arrangement and then fused together to provide
different shapes (dried form), depending upon the alkyl chain length.
Moreover, it is interesting to note that the formed vesicles of [C6mim][DF] having sizes of 20–30 nm are arranged in an
elliptical-shaped structure, like that of the leaf of a mango tree,
along with some rod-shaped structure, whereas the vesicles of [C8mim][DF] having sizes of 25–35 nm are engrafted in
the shape of a leaf of grass, although the vesicles of [C10mim][DF] and [C12mim][DF] are simply embedded in the rod-shaped
structure, having sizes of 40–50 and 12–21 nm, respectively.
Interestingly, the vesicles of [C14mim][DF] having sizes
of 20–51 nm are self-assembled in the form of beautiful bouquet.

enlarged TEM image of the area enclosed by dashed lines.

4 Conclusions
NSAID-based
DF-ILs, [Cnmim][DF] (n = 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) have been synthesized and investigated
for their interfacial and bulk behavior in aqueous solution. DF-ILs
are found to have 70–305-fold smaller cacs than those of their
Cl– analogues. The synthesized ILs have better interfacial,
thermodynamics, and bulk properties in terms of pC20, Πcac, Γmax, Amin, β, ΔG°agg, etc. than those of their Cl– analogues.
All of these improved properties and lower cac values are mainly because
of three reasons: (i) The electrostatic repulsions between Cnmim+ are effectively screened by
aromatic DF–, which is due to weak hydration of
DF– as compared to that of the smaller Cl–. (ii) The aromatic DF– offer π–π
stacking between oppositely charged Cnmim+ and DF–, contributing a synergic
effect to the aggregation. (iii) The total hydrophobicity of molecules
are increased due to the insertion of aromatic DF–. ULVs are formed at an extremely low concentration by only exchanging
counter-ion Cl– with DF–, as evaluated
by SANS and TEM measurements. The chaotropic ion–chaotropic
ion interactions due to surface charges and hydrophobic interactions
are attributed to the binding of the DF– ion to
the Cnmim+ head group, as per
Collins’ law. Moreover, the alkyl chains at either end in the
bilayer of vesicles do not form looped conformation in bilayer thickness.
The rigidity of DF– appears to prevent the looped
conformations and thus promotes a bilayer spanning conformation having
thickness approximately equal to double that of the extended chain
length. Interestingly, these formed vesicles are grouped into various
shapes (dried forms) depending upon the alkyl chain length analyzed
by TEM images. Moreover, this is the first report that puts into picture
the formation of vesicles for such a short six carbon alkyl chain.
