The
interaction of water and hydrophilic sites with hydroxyl, carboxyl,
and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) in lignite
molecules was studied by density functional theory. The adsorption
of water molecules on the lignite surface initially resulted in the
formation of hydrogen bond-driven stable rings by three to four water
molecules, followed by the formation of three-dimensional water clusters
like a ″patchwork″. Aqueous layer thickness obtained
from the water cluster size was 0.4–0.6 nm, which was consistent
with the experimental data. Thus, pore-filling water beyond this range
was less affected by the OFGs on the surface. Calculation of the adsorption
energy predicts that the water clusters were primarily formed in the
hydrophilic sites with three OFGs (site 1, including a carbonyl group,
an alcoholic hydroxyl group and an etheroxy group in tetrahydropyran),
then in COOH, and in O–H. For isolated hydroxyl groups, the
interaction between the hydroxyl group and water molecules was weaker
than that between the water molecules. When the water cluster was
located at the hydrophilic sites with two or more OFGs, the adsorption
energy of lignite–water interaction was higher than that of
water–water interaction. Investigating the thermodynamics of
the adsorption process at a molecular scale will help in understanding
both drying and resorption process of dried lignite during industrial
production.

Introduction
Lignite
has a high moisture content of 30–70 wt % on a wet
basis.1 The moisture content in lignite
is classified in various ways,2,3 and the widely accepted
classification is based on parameters such as monolayer-adsorbed water,
multilayer-adsorbed water, capillary water, and bulk water.4−6 These classifications were based on the outcomes of adsorption experiments
and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy.
The occurrence of water was related to its local physicochemical environment
and affected the desorption energy consumption during drying or pyrolysis
process.

Scientific and rational molecular structure is an important
foundation
for molecular-level scientific research. Mathews and Chaffee7 provided a comprehensive review of the molecular
structure of coal. The first lignite model was published by Wender
in 1976 (Figure 1a)8 and is still the most widely accepted model because
of its small molecular weight, rich oxygen-containing functional groups
(OFG), and good representation. Molecular simulation of the adsorption
of some water molecules into porous carbon materials9−11 can be found in literature. Feng et al.12−15 used carbon nanotubes, graphene
oxide, and small molecules with different OFGs as lignite monomers
to investigate the interaction between OFG and water (nH2O@OFG) and found that the interaction energy between
water and carboxyl molecules (nH2O@carboxyl)
was the largest, followed by the interaction with phenolic hydroxyl,
carbonyl, and benzene, which was similar to the results obtained by
Wu et al.16 (interaction of 1H2O@OFG carboxyl > phenolic hydroxyl > carbonyl > alcoholic
hydroxyl
> ether). Wu et al. also accurately demonstrated the hydrogen bonds
(HB), van der Waals interactions, and steric repulsion by reduced
density gradient isosurface. Vu et al.17,18 used lignin
molecule to investigate the lignite–water interactions and
found a significantly reduced mobility of water molecules in local
to the lignin hydroxyls owing to hydrogen bond (HB) formation. Xiao
et al.19 studied the HB interactions between
the organic oxygen/nitrogen monomers of lignite and water molecules;
water cage clusters and water film clusters were formed around the
OFGs and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic plane in the organic oxygen
and nitrogen monomers, respectively.

electrostatic potential (ESP),

of ESP ranging from −6.2 e–2 to 6.2 e–2. Colored balls represent C atom in dark gray, H atom
in light gray, and O atom in red; the corresponding isovalue is 0.1
au. (For an interpretation of the references to color in this figure
legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

The water cluster size is dependent on the physicochemical
structure
of the materials.20−23 Do et al.20,21 suggested that water molecules
are adsorbed around the OFGs in the form of clusters, and water is
adsorbed into the micropores when the concentration of this water
cluster is high enough. An ab initio investigation of water cluster
suggested that the smaller clusters with n = 4, 5,
or 8 could be used as the basic building blocks for generating larger
clusters.23 In our previous dynamic vapor
sorption experiment of lignites,22 we fitted
our adsorption/desorption isotherms with the D.D model20,21 and found that the critical size of water clusters penetrating and
residing in the lignite micropores was six to seven water molecules.

In this study, hydrophilic sites on the lignite surface with 1,
2, and 3 OFGs were chosen, and the water clusters were developed local
to the hydrophilic sites as the occurrence of water in the experiments.
Based on the experimental results, the cluster size was estimated
at seven water molecules. Compared with OFGs, nonpolar functional
groups, such as alkanes and benzene rings, have much weaker interactions
with water24 and only acted as a “chemical
environment” for nH2O@lignite in
this study.

Results and Discussion
Electrostatic Potential Distribution in the
Molecular Model
of Lignite
The electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution,
which is used to predict the reactive sites of electrophilic and nucleophilic
reactions, is shown in Figure 1. The ESP varies from −6.2 e–2 to
6.2 e–2 on moving from blue to red. The ESP around
the oxygen atom was low, while that around the hydrogen atom connected
to the oxygen atom was high. The HB donor and acceptor in the lignite
molecule were distributed on the OFGs, and the lignite molecule could
simultaneously behave as a HB donor and acceptor during the HB formation.
The choice of hydrophilic sites of lignite was based on the analysis
of ESP distribution.

Formation of Water Clusters on the Hydrophilic
Sites of Lignite
The adsorption of water on lignite is essentially
based on the
weak interaction between the molecules, including HBs and van der
Waals interactions. During the formation of a HB, the oxygen atom
in both OFGs and water can serve as HB acceptors, while the hydrogen
atoms connected to the oxygen atom in OFGs and water molecules can
act as donors. The hydroxyl groups on the lignite surface would be
dissolved by the nonfreezing water nearby, and there might be a rapid
proton–proton exchange that would increase the mobility of
the hydroxyl groups. A similarity between the protons in hydroxyl
groups and those in nonfreezing water could be observed in an NMR
analysis,25 which meant that OFGs and water
molecules played similar roles in the formation of HBs.

The
most important OFGs in lignite are the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.
Thus, single hydroxyl and carboxyl group, as well as multiple OFGs
were selected to explore the formation of water clusters on the hydrophilic
sites on the lignite surface.

Water Clusters near the
Hydroxyl Group (O–H) in Lignite
Molecular Model
In lignite with low moisture content, the
water molecules around the hydrophilic sites are not evenly distributed
on the surface of the coal molecule but in the form of water clusters,
like a “patchwork”,26,27 patched together
at the active site. Therefore, the configuration of the water molecules
in this study was mainly in the form of water clusters.

First,
we chose a hydroxyl group that was spatially away from other OFGs
(labeled O–H; Figure 2). Water molecules were added one by one near O–H to
optimize the structure. The size of the water cluster was six to seven
water molecules, as obtained by fitting the experimentally obtained
lignite moisture desorption isotherm.28 The optimized structure of nH2O@O–H
(n = 1–7) is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Formation of water cluster on the hydrophilic
sites of O–H,
labeled as nH2O@O–H (a to g correspond
to n = 1–7).

The first water molecule was connected to a hydrogen atom from
the hydroxyl group, and the hydroxyl group acted as an electron donor.
Because of the chainlike connection, the HB length was 1.88 Å.
The oxygen atom from the hydroxyl group of the second water molecule
formed a HB, and the hydroxyl group of the second water molecule acted
as an electron acceptor. During this, the hydroxyl group acted both
as an electron donor and an acceptor and directly adsorbed two water
molecules to form two HBs. In the commonly accepted adsorption mechanism,6,20 water molecules directly adsorbed with OFGs are considered as the
monolayer water (primary adsorption), and the monolayer water adsorbs
further water molecules to form the multilayer water (secondary adsorption).
Our study reveals that the number of the monolayer water molecules
directly adsorbed with an OFG was more than one water molecule, especially
for the carboxyl group. A HB was also formed between the two water
molecules; thus, the addition of the second water molecule introduced
two HBs, and finally the three oxygen atoms formed a cyclic trimer.
The lengths of the HBs were between 1.81 and 1.86 Å, which was
lower than that of the HB of 1H2O@O–H. When a third
water molecule was added, the four oxygen atoms formed a cyclic tetramer;
the length of the HB was further reduced to 1.70–1.75 Å.
Since the strength of the HB is related to its length for the same
type of HBs, the interaction should be stronger with the water molecule
added in it.

When the fourth water molecule was added, the hydroxyl
oxygen acted
as an HB acceptor of two HBs, resulting in an increase in the length
of the original HB to 2.04 Å. There were also HBs between the
two donors, and the lengths of the HBs between them were close to
that of a cyclic trimer. However, the length of the HB of the hydroxyl
group (HBO–HD) as an electron donor and the HB close
to it reduced to 1.69 Å, which meant that these two were the
strongest HBs in this water cluster. Although the configuration of
the oxygen atoms was not destroyed, the water cluster transformed
to a three-dimensional (3D) structure and the length of different
HBs also changed significantly.

After the addition of the fifth
and sixth water molecules, a relatively
regular triangular prism-shaped cavity was obtained. On the upper
and lower surfaces of the triangular prism, the lengths of the two
HBs were close to each other, ensuring the symmetry of the structure.
Both the hydroxyl groups and water molecules had 3 HBs connected to
other molecules, and they served as both HB donors and acceptors.
The strongest HB was HBO–HD, as mentioned above,
and the HB parallel to HBO–HD.

The addition
of the sixth water molecule transformed the triangle
on the bottom of the original triangular prism to a quadrilateral,
while the triangle on the upper bottom surface was retained. However,
the HB in the upper position corresponding to the insertion position
extended to 2.53 Å, thus weakening the interaction. The length
of the HBO–HD further decreased to 1.65 Å.

In summary, when the hydroxyl group acted as a hydrophilic site,
with the increasing number of water molecules, the HBs were affected
by the newly added water molecules; the length of the original HBs
changed first, and then some water molecules were rearranged, resulting
in the destruction of the original HBs. Therefore, the configurational
optimization of water cluster resulted in the global (and not local)
optimization of the entire water cluster, which was also an important
reason for the nonlinear increase in the adsorption energy.

Isomers were involved in the adsorption of water molecules on OFGs
in lignite, including the hydroxyl group, which has HB donor and acceptor.
Each water molecule could act as HB donor and acceptor, too. There
could be various types of isomers involved in the adsorption of water
molecules, especially multiple water molecules with OFGs, to form
larger water clusters. In this study, there were some empirical choices
in the process of water cluster construction. When adding water molecules,
the maximum possible number of HBs were formed to increase the adsorption
energy and obtain a more stable configuration. At the same time, isomers
were explored, and the lowest-energy structures among the isomers
are shown in this work.

Water Clusters near Carboxyl Groups in the
Molecular Model of
Lignite
Water clusters near the carboxyl groups in the molecular
model of lignite are shown in Figure 3. The parameters of hydrogen bond length are given
in Figures S1–S3. When a water molecule
was present near the carboxyl group, the carbonyl oxygen and hydrogen
atoms on the carboxyl group acted as HB donors and acceptors, respectively,
and formed a cyclic trimer with the water molecules. Similar to the
adsorption of water molecules near the hydroxyl group, the addition
of the second water molecule formed a cyclic tetramer and the addition
of the third water molecule formed a 3D cluster. The difference lay
in the two oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group, and the carbonyl group
also acts as a HB acceptor. Unexpectedly, when six water molecules
were adsorbed, the size of the water cluster was larger, and it interacted
with another OFG close to it. Therefore, the size and configuration
of the water clusters were related to the local density of sites and
their relative location, and not the overall site density.22

COOH, labeled
as nH2O@COOH (a to g corresponds to n = 1–7).

Water Clusters Located in the Hydrophilic Sites with Two or
More OFGs
The water cluster located in the hydrophilic sites
with multiple OFGs was studied. The hydrophilic site with three OFGs
(site 1, containing a carbonyl group, an alcoholic hydroxyl group,
and an etheroxy group in tetrahydropyran) in the initial configuration
of lignite molecules was selected. When water clusters were adsorbed
near a hydroxyl group (different from the hydroxyl group discussed
in Figure 2), the change
in the configuration of the lignite molecules was similar to ″folding″,
and the water molecules interacted with the two other OFGs. Thus,
the water clusters interacted with multiple OFGs. In fact, the first
added water molecule already had three HBs. The formation of water
clusters in site 1 is shown in Figure 4. When the water cluster reaches a certain size after
being adsorbed near the carboxyl group, it also interacted with the
surrounding OFGs (Figure 3f).

as nH2O@site 1 ((a–g) corresponds
to n = 1–7).

Thermodynamic Calculation of the Adsorption Energy of Water
Clusters on Lignite
The desorption energy (ΔEs) for desorbing water as isolated water molecules
is expressed as 1  where the molecular energies of lignite
and
single water molecule are expressed as El and EH, respectively. The energy of
lignite and n water molecules after adsorption is expressed as El+nH. EBSSE is the
corrected energy for basis set superposition error, and the EBSSE
given by the basis sets presented here is performed using the counterpoise
method. Generally, EBSSE could reduce
the bond energy, even though the value is small, making the calculated
value closer to the experimental value. Moreover, it had been mentioned
in several papers that the BSSE must be corrected for calculations
on van der Waals molecules.29

The
desorption energy of water molecules near O–H is shown in Figure 5. Both the total
energy of all the water molecules and the average energy of every
water molecule are given in Figure 5a. The total adsorption energy of water on the lignite
molecules increased from 4.51 to 62.43 kcal/mol with increasing number
of adsorbed water molecules. The average adsorption energy of each
water molecule was in the range 4.51–9.93 kcal/mol; in the
water cluster with three to seven water molecules, the average adsorption
energy was higher (8.86–9.93 kcal/mol).

Figure 5 Adsorption energy of
water cluster near O–H site with (a)
the number of the water molecules and (b) the number of HB.

The HB of the first two water molecules adsorbed
is directly formed
by the lignite molecules, and the subsequent HBs gradually increased
with HBs between the water molecules. The number of HBs between the
water and lignite molecules was between one to three throughout the
process. The increase in the average adsorption energy of each water
molecule indicated that the interaction between lignite and water
was weaker than that between the water molecules when water molecules
were adsorbed near O–H. This could be because each water molecule
had two hydroxyl groups, which could form further HBs, and the increase
in the HBs directly determined the adsorption energy between the water
clusters and lignite molecules. Figure 5b shows the total and average adsorption energies with
the number of total HBs formed in the lignite–water molecular
structure, and the adsorption energy of one HB was in the range 4.45–6.65
kcal/mol.

The average adsorption energy of each water molecule
adsorbed near
COOH at the early stage was also higher (7.68–10.59 kcal/mol),
as shown in Figure 6. This could be attributed to the fact that COOH itself contained
more HB acceptors and donors. This result also confirmed that the
interaction of nH2O@COOH was stronger
than of nH2O@OH during adsorption.

Figure 6 Adsorption
energy of water cluster besides the COOH site with (a)
the number of the water molecules and (b) the number of HB.

The adsorption energy of water clusters located
in site 1 is shown
in Figure 7. The adsorption
energy of 1H2O@site 1 was higher than that of nH2O@site 1 (n > 2) and that of nH2O@COOH (n < 3) was also
higher than that of nH2O@COOH (n > 3), which meant that the lignite–water interaction
is stronger than the water–water interaction during the adsorption
at COOH and site 1. This is consistent with the literature.30 However, for O–H, the water–water
interaction was stronger than the lignite–water interaction.
Most OFGs formed one HB with the water molecules, and the secondary
water molecules affected the primary adsorbed water molecules. However,
the energy of the primary adsorbed water molecule was not necessarily
the highest and was dependent on the length of the HB and configuration
of the water cluster.

Figure 7 Adsorption energy of water cluster in the hydrophilic
region with
(a) the number of the water molecules and (b) the number of HB.

The average adsorption energy of 1H2O@site 1 was the
highest (10.96 kcal/mol) and much higher than those of 1H2O@OH (4.51 kcal/mol) and 1H2O@COOH (9.36 kcal/mol). However,
the total adsorption energy of nH2O@site
1 (n > 2) was not obviously higher than those
of nH2O@OH and nH2O@COOH.
Thus, the most significant superiority of site 1 was at the start
of the adsorption process. The average adsorption energy of each HB
was slightly lower than that of nH2O@COOH,
because of which the total adsorption energy was determined by the
number of HBs.

Comparing of Model Calculation and Experimental
Result
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed
that the
size of the clusters was 0.4–0.7 nm. For example, the farthest
distance between the atoms in hydroxyl group and water cluster was
0.48 nm, and the longest distance in the water cluster was 0.59 nm.
The NMR analysis reveals that the nonfreezable water forms mono- or
bilayers, providing a shield of thickness in the range of 0.3–0.6
nm.25 Hence, the water cluster size in
this study was reliable.

The experimental adsorption energy
was in the range 10.85–12.35 kcal/mol for hard lignite (as
determined in our previous study)31 and
10.4–14.0 kcal/mol for soft lignite.32 Site 1 and COOH had a higher primary adsorption energy, and the
highest average adsorption energy of nH2O@OFGs was 10.96 kcal/mol, which was close but lower than the experimentally
obtained value. This might be because the actual adsorption processes
are much more complex than the simulated adsorption on a single hydrophilic
site.

The desorption results showed that the local density of
hydrophilic
sites had the most significant effect on water desorption and resorption
process. Hence, it was better to reduce the density of hydrophilic
sites when drying; reducing the carboxyl groups could also be effective.
During the decomposition of OFGs in the thermal treatment33,34 (Figure 8), the OFGs
had an obvious reduction at 240 °C for 20 min and 320 °C
for 10 min, and the reduction of carboxyl group at 320 °C for
10 min was larger than that at 240 °C for 20 min. When drying,
both the residue water content and OFGs should be taken into account
to reduce the resorption of the drying products. Combining with the
drying kinetics and pyrolysis analysis from our previous study,35,36 it is clear that drying at 300 °C could reduce the water content
and OFGs and prevent heat loss from lignite pyrolysis, and thus, may
be a good choice.

Figure 8 Reduction of OFGs in the thermal-treated process.33,34 Temperatures of different OFGs that start to decompose are also
provided.

Conclusions
The
interaction between lignite and water molecules was explored
by DFT and compared with our previous experimental results. Different
hydrophilic sites with single OFG (hydroxyl and carboxyl) or multiple
OFGs in the lignite molecular model were selected for water adsorption.
During the growth of the water cluster, the configurational optimization
of the water cluster was the global (and not local) optimization of
the entire water cluster, which was also an important reason for the
nonlinear increase in the adsorption energy. The interaction between
lignite and water was weaker than that between water molecules when
water molecules were adsorbed near O–H. When water clusters
were around COOH and site 1, more HBs between water molecules and
lignite molecule were formed, and the interaction between lignite
and water was stronger than that between the water molecules. Estimation
of the adsorption energy reveals that the water clusters are primarily
formed in site 1, then in COOH, and lastly in O–H.

Methods
Lignite Molecular
Model and Calculation Methods Selections and
Properties of Lignite Molecular Model
The first lignite model
was published by Wender in 1976 (Figure 1a).8 This model
has the following advantages. (1) The molecular weight of this model
is small, with the formula of C47H54O13, which can greatly improve the calculation efficiency. (2) It is
rich in OFGs, i.e., alcoholic hydroxyl groups, phenolic hydroxyl groups,
carboxyl groups, carbonyl groups, ether bonds, and benzofuran, which
cover all the common functional groups with just over a hundred atoms,
are present. (3) The oxygen content of this model is about 20%, which
is close to that obtained experimentally (23–25%). (4) This
model has good representation. With low degree of condensation, abundant
OFGs, various fat side chains, etc., this model is consistent with
the basic characteristics of lignite molecules and is widely accepted
(studies based on this model have been cited nearly 150 times).

The comparison of the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of
the model and experiment is shown in Figure S4. The peak position of oxygen-containing functional groups (wavenumber
< 2500 cm–1) from FTIR of this model is in agreement
with that of experiment, but the composition of coal in experiment
is always complex with different organics and minerals. The most obvious
differences were located in the range of wavenumber of 2500–4000
cm–1, and the wavenumber of 3000–3600 cm–1 is assigned to –OH from quartz in the sample.
But this model is consistent with the basic characteristics of lignite
molecules and is widely accepted; therefore, this model was used to
study the adsorption of water by lignite molecules in this study.

Calculation Software and Calculation Method
The molecular
thermodynamic calculations were performed using the quantum chemical
software Gaussian 09. The hybrid DFT method, B3LYP, and the basis
set 6-31G(d) were used. The desorption energy obtained were corrected
by zero point and basis set superposition error. Lower stabilization
energy of water clusters might be obtained by more accurate methods
and higher level of basis set, but the computation time for obtaining
a stable structure will be much longer (months for a single calculation);
it was quite difficult to obtain stable 7H2O·OFGs
structures. Considering that the overall trends in the energetics
remain unaltered with the change in the basis set or the level of
theory,23 this basis set was chosen for
this study.
