Hybrid poly(ether
sulfones) (PES)–TiO2 electrospun
mats are used as selective filters to remove lead and zinc ions from
water. Presence of TiO2 is functional to trigger fiber’s
surface charge that allows for better performances in terms of ionic
adsorption with respect to bare PES mats. Temperature increase promotes
a speed up of ion removal. Ability of electrospun mats to retain adsorbed
ions is proven by washing procedures, which confirm the lack of released
Pb2+ in solution, even after sonication. To detect presence
of metal ions in aqueous solutions, water-soluble porphyrins are used
as chemosensors, which are able to provide fast, in-field, and real-time
analysis. In particular, cationic H2T4 metalation, occurring both
in solution or at transparent glass surface, allows for a straightforward
spectrophotometric (UV–vis) detection of metal ions in solution.

Introduction
Water
shortening is a global problem threatening modern society,
and, consequently, there is a worldwide urgency to provide solutions
allowing for treatment and reuse of the reclaimed wastewater. Heavy
metals, such as Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, As, and Zn, are environmental
pollutants extensively existing in water; they can be discharged into
the water sources from various human activities, especially from industrial
one. Even at trace levels, they are poisonous to human health because
of their nonbiodegradability and bioaccumulation in the human body
and therefore causing various diseases and disorders.1 In particular, lead, in both its forms Pb2+ and
Pb4+, is one of the extremely toxic heavy metals, even
at low concentrations.2,3 Hence, it seems a priority to
treat lead contaminated wastewaters before releasing them into the
environment. Removal of lead is achieved by one or more of the methods
like chemical precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange, ultrafiltration,
reverse osmosis, electrodeposition, solvent extraction, foam floatation,
complexation/sequestration, filtration, and evaporation.4 Among all these techniques, adsorption is considered
a very effective and economical process for metal ions removal from
wastewaters due to availability of several low-cost, easily accessible
and more important there is no release or use of secondary pollutants.

Fibrous electrospun mats represent an innovative solution to face
out water pollution:5,6 in fact, electrospinning is an
easy and highly versatile technique, which allows for fabrication
of one-dimensional micro/nanofibers characterized by very high surface
area, porosity, and tailored mechanical properties.7 Use of fibrous mats to eliminate metal ions from water
have been recently proposed,5,8 and potentialities of
electrospuns mats as sorbent materials to be used for water treatment
purpose have been discussed in many papers,9 especially by considering the versatility of electrospinning technique
in fabrication of polymeric and ceramic materials in nanofibrous form.5 Moreover, electrospun mats can be obtained as
self-supporting veils, which can be additively manufactured to conventional
membranes and filters to provide them additional functionalities.
Different polymers are under investigation, and contaminants removal
is achieved by exploiting the ability of these polymer-based materials
to interact with polluting species by dispersive forces, electrostatic
or chemical interactions, depending on the nature of used polymers
and/or presence of functional molecules attached onto fibers surface.8 To our knowledge, few papers report about use
of poly(ether sulfone) (PES) electrospun nanofibers for water contaminants
removal, whereas most of the literature data refer to copolymer electrospun
mats based on, for example, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)/poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA)10 or nylon-6 and polycaprolactone.11 Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) thermally cross-linked
with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) fibrous mats has been tested for removal
of copper(II) ions in water;12 poly(vinyl
chloride) fibers are used to remove Cu(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II);13 aminated polyacrylonitrile nanofiber mat’s
ability to remove Ag(I), Cu(II), Pb(II), and Fe(II) from aqueous solution
was studied.14 Many other polymeric mats
have been studied for water treatment applications,15 but poly(ether sulfone) is particularly appealing since
it is conventionally employed as material in water filter fabrication.16,17 As to the use of these mats for water treatments, recent work reported
about their use to remove and/or degrade organic dyes18 by combination of electrospinning techniques with physical
vapor deposition19 or chemical bath deposition.6 Semiconducting oxides are generally coupled to
polymeric fibers: electrospinning is often combined with nanostructures
deposition techniques or oxide nanoparticles are dispersed into micro–nanofibers.

In this work, hybrid poly(ether sulfone)–TiO2 (PES–TiO2) electrospun mats are tested as sorbent
filter to remove lead and zinc from water. The role of TiO2 to improve sorption performance has been demonstrated as well as
the ability of fibrous mats to retain metal ions.

Another important
result is also represented by the possibility
to perform a fast and real-time determination of residual lead (or
zinc) in solutions to estimate mats removal performances by using
cationic porphyrins as molecular probes.20 Porphyrins represent a multitopic class of organic compounds, which
can be promptly exploited in sensing:21 as for heavy metal detection in water, metal ions can be coordinated
by pyrrolic nitrogens of porphyrin core by forming a metallated derivative,22 whose presence in solution induces significant
spectral modifications in the wavelength region between 350 and 700
nm, allowing for detection of metal ions at concentration below parts
per million (ppm).23 Herein, porphyrins
are used both in solution or immobilized on transparent glass:24 the latter approach benefits any detrimental
effect deriving from dispersion of molecular probe (even if in micromolar
concentration) in water.

Noteworthy, most of the reported approaches
to estimate the adsorption
efficiency make use of inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP),
which is a conventional procedure to determine mat’s uptake
capability. Accordingly, the possibility to use UV–vis spectroscopy
for indirect determination of metal ion concentration after treatment
paves the way to alternative strategies for in-field and real-time
water analysis.

Results
PES and PES–TiO2 Electrospun Mats
Self-supporting veils of PES-based
electrospun mats are tested as
filters to remove lead from water. Figure 1a shows a typical scanning electron microscope
(SEM) image of PES polymeric fibers, which are dimensionally uniform
(mean diameter 500 nm) and bead-free.

Figure 1 SEM images of PES (a) and PES–TiO2 (b) polymeric
fibers; (c) energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of PES–TiO2 mats (Au signal is due to surface metallization).

PES–TiO2 mats are obtained by
adding Ti-isopropoxide
(TIIP) to PES dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF)/toluene solutions
(Figure 1b); presence
of titanium precursor in the mats is confirmed by EDS analysis (Figure 1c).

Amorphous
hydrous oxide precipitate (TiO2·nH2O) formation inside fibrous mats is promoted
by hydrolysis and condensation of TIIP25 due to water presence in the environment and solvent solution. Thermal
treatments of mats at 100 °C (overnight) induce a partial loss
of water but cannot lead to crystallization. Figure 2 shows UV–vis spectra of electrospun
solution characterized by a strong absorption at ∼λ =
350 nm, attributed to TiO2 band–band transition.26

Pb2+ Removal Using PES and PES–TiO2 Fibrous
Mats
Residual Pb2+ ion concentration
in aqueous solutions treated with bare PES mats is measured in real
time by UV–vis spectroscopy after addition of H2T4 (1 μM).
Experiments were conducted by placing 20 cm2 fibrous mats
in a beaker and by pouring 20 mL of Pb2+ containing aqueous
solution at pH = 7.

Presence of Pb2+ metal ions in
solution promotes H2T4 metalation and related formation of the metal
derivative (PbT4), as clearly indicated by Soret band splitting in
two components, at λ1 = 423 nm and λ2 = 476 nm, respectively. By studying metalation kinetic of H2T4 by
varying the metal ions concentration in water, it is possible to estimate
the residual ions concentration after spontaneous adsorption into
the fibrous mats. Accordingly, H2T4 (1 μM) Soret band spectral
modifications caused by porphyrin complexation in presence of lead
ions in water are used as reference. Spectra are recorded by gradually
increasing Pb2+ concentration in aqueous solution, 15 min
after each addition (Figure S1, Supporting
Information), and the intensity ratio between component at λ1 and λ2 (I476/I423)
is plotted upon increasing Pb2+ concentration.

Pb2+ concentration decrease, induced by water treatment
with electrospun mats, is provided by UV–vis spectrophotometric
measurements after H2T4 addition to Pb(NO3)2 5 μM solution before (red line) and after (green line) mat
dipping (Figure 3a).

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis
absorption spectra of [H2T4] = 1 μM (black
line) with [Pb2+] = 5 μM (red line) and after 1 h
dipping of PES mats (green line); (b) schematization of dipping and
control procedures.

Upon decreasing metal
concentration, the metalation process is
slowed down and intensity ratio I476/I423 changes;
in particular, I476/I423 ratio varies from 2.5
(before fiber dipping) to 1.2 after dipping of PES mats. Therefore,
an evident decrease of the amount of Pb2+ in solution is
achieved after 1 h. In agreement with spectral variations of reference
solutions (Figure S1, Supporting Information),
residual Pb2+ concentration (after 1 h fibers dipping)
can be estimated to be <3 μM (∼50%). The efficiency
of the proposed sensing approach is remarkable: in fact, Pb2+ concentration is fast determined (15 min) without any water treatment
to get rid of sorbent material (Figure 3b).

It is reasonable to assume that Pb2+ is adsorbed by
PES fibers because of dispersive forces.27 Accordingly, to better highlight the importance of system electrostatics,
pH responsive fiber’s surface charge is achieved by adding
titanium isopropoxide (TIIP) to PES solution to obtain hybrid PES–TiO2 fibers.28,29 TiO2 has an isoelectric
point (IEP) of about 6,30 hence, surface
charge becomes more negative upon increasing solution pH. To validate
this assumption, PES–TiO2 mats are dipped in H2T4
5 μM solutions having pH = 5 and 8; this approach is suggested
by the use of TiO2 sols, in textile industry, to improve
dyeing of cotton fabrics.31

H2T4
is a cationic porphyrin whose affinity toward negatively charged
surface has been largely proven.27 At pH
> 7, fiber surface charge is negative, whereas at pH < 7, it
is
positive. Consequently, H2T4 adsorption on mats should change upon
varying solution pH (Figure 4); as expected, mats dipping at pH = 5 (Figure 4a) lead to a less significant porphyrin immobilization
on surface than that observed at pH = 8 (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 (a) UV–vis absorption spectra of [H2T4]
= 5 μM before
(black line) and after 5 h (red line) and 20 h (blue line) PES–TiO2 fibers dipping at pH = 5. (b) UV–vis absorption spectra
[H2T4] = 5 μM before (black line) and after 5 h (red line) and
20 h (blue line) PES–TiO2 fibers dipping at pH =
8.

Presence of TiO2 in
PES mats promotes an adsorption
of Pb2+ (at pH = 7) higher than that observed for bare
PES mats, as evident in Figure 5 that points to a variation of I476/I423 from 2.5 (red line) to 0.3 (green line) after mats dipping (corresponding
to a Pb2+ concentration of ∼1 μM), more significant
with respect to that observed after treatment with bare PES mats.

Figure 5 UV–vis
absorption spectra of [H2T4] = 1 μM (black
curve) after addition of [Pb2+] = 5 μM (red curve)
and after 1 h PES–TiO2 mats dipping (green curve)
at T = 20 °C.

To conclude, PES–TiO2-based fibrous mats
are
proven effective as filter to remove Pb2+ from water. Upon
increasing dipping time up to 24–48 h, it is possible to decrease
Pb2+ concentration down to 0.25 μM (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

Temperature increase
from 20 to 35 °C promotes an almost total
removal of lead in less than 5 h (Figure 6).

Figure 6 UV–vis absorption spectra of [H2T4] =
1 μM (gray dotted
line) after addition of [Pb2+] = 5 μM (red line)
and after 1 h (green line) and 5 h (blue line) mats dipping at T = 35 °C.

To demonstrate the ability of the fibrous mats to retain
adsorbed
lead, they are washed/sonicated with water after Pb2+ adsorption.
To determine presence of Pb2+ in washing solution, H2T4
1 μM is added as chemosensor (Figure 7).

Figure 7 UV–vis absorption spectra of [H2T4] =
1 μM (black
line) at T = 20 °C: after addition of [Pb2+] = 5 μM (red line), after treatment with PES–TiO2 mats (blue line), and after addition to washing solution
of Pb2+ adsorbed mats (green line).

UV–vis spectra confirm the decrease of lead concentration
after mats dipping in [Pb2+] = 5 μM solution (blue
line). H2T4 addition to fibers washing solution (green line), resulting
from 3 h sonication, does not reveal presence of any appreciable trace
of Pb2+ ions as pointed by the shape of Soret band, perfectly
superimposable to the signal of free porphyrin reference (black line).

Zn2+ Removal Using PES and PES–TiO2 Fibrous
Mats
H2T4 solutions cannot be used to detect Zn2+ presence in sub-millimolar concentration (Figure S3, Supporting Information) due to an unfavorable metalation
kinetic.32 However, we can demonstrate
the capability of H2T4 layers, deposited on glass slides, to detect
zinc presence by exploiting the fast metal insertion into the cavity
of distorted porphyrin immobilized on glass surface (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Dipping of H2T4-treated
glass in a zinc nitrate control solution (5 μM) causes modification
of the Soret band of deposited H2T4, which appears red shifted, broader,
and less intense than that observed for reference glasses.33,34 In presence of Zn2+ ions, the band centered at λ
= 433 nm (attributed to free porphyrin immobilized on surface) shows
a new component at λ = 446 nm due to formation of ZnT4 and modification
of Q-band (inset) region, where a new band at λ = 575 nm appears
(red line).

The same control is performed on same solution after
treatment with PES–TiO2 mats: the lack of significant
spectral modification suggests a scarce ability of mats to retain
Zn2+ ions, even after long treatment times. In fact, [Zn2+] concentration in solution does not seem significantly changed
even after 24 to 48 h of mats dipping (Figure 8a, green and blue line, respectively).

Figure 8 (a) UV–vis
absorption spectra of H2T4 on glass (black line):
after dipping in Zn2+ solution [5 μM] (red line)
and after dipping in the solution of Zn2+ treated with
mats for 24 h (green line) and for 48 h (blue line) at T = 20 °C. (b) UV–vis absorption spectra of H2T4 on glass
(black line): after dipping in Zn2+ solution (5 μM)
(red line) and after dipping in the solution of Zn2+ treated
with mats for 1 h (green line) and for 5 h (blue line) at T = 35 °C. Q-bands region is shown in the insets.

On the contrary, if mats treatment
is executed at 35 °C, Zn2+ ions are almost totally
removed from solution after 5 h
(Figure 8b). By observing
porphyrin Soret band evolution, before and after fibers dipping, an
evident shift of Soret maximum as well as modification of Q-bands
(inset) is now observable. After 1 h treatment, Zn2+ concentration
in solution is still slightly decreased (green line), but after 5
h, zinc is almost completely removed, as indicated by the position
of Soret and Q-bands pattern (blue line), similar to that associated
to free base on glass.

Similar results are obtained when same
approach is used to detect
Pb2+ adsorption on fibers (Figure 9), performed by operating both at 20 °C
(Figure 9a) and 35
°C (Figure 9b).

Figure 9 (a) UV–vis
absorption spectra of H2T4 on glass (black line):
after dipping in Pb2+ (5 μM) solution (red line)
and after dipping in the solution of Pb2+ treated with
mats for 24 h (green line) and for 48 h (blue line) at T = 20 °C. (b) UV–vis absorption spectra of H2T4 on glass
(black line): after dipping in Pb2+ (5 μM) solution
(red line) and after dipping in the solution of Pb2+ treated
with mats for 1 h (green line) and for 5 h (blue line) at T = 35 °C. Q-bands region is shown in the inset.

At 20 °C, Pb2+ concentration is completely removed
in about 48 h, whereas at 35 °C, the same results are achieved
in about 5 h. Noteworthy, treated glass response agrees well with
that provided by the use of H2T4 1 μM solution as Pb2+ ion sensor.

Selective Removal of Zn2+ and
Pb2+ in
Solution Using PES and PES–TiO2 Fibrous Mats
H2T4 (1 μM) Soret band modification after addition to aqueous
solutions containing both Pb2+ 5 μM/Zn2+ 5 μM in which PES–TiO2 mats were dipped
for 24–48 h is reported in Figure 10a. Noteworthy, broadening of band component
centered at λ = 423 nm indicates formation of both ZnT4 and
PbT4. In fact, Pb2+ presence promotes Pb2+ to
Zn2+ transmetalation, leading to formation of ZnT4 (not
formed in absence of Pb2+). Band narrowing (observed after
48 h) indicates a concentration decrease of both Zn2+ and
Pb2+ ions.

Figure 10 (a) UV–vis absorption spectra of [H2T4] = 1 μM
solution
(black line) at T = 20 °C: after addition to
Pb2+ (5 μM)/Zn2+ (5 μM) solution
(red line) and after addition to Pb2+/Zn2+ solution
treated with mats for 24 h (green line) and for 48 h (blue line).
(b) UV–vis absorption spectra of H2T4 on glass (black line)
at T = 20 °C: after dipping in Pb2+ (5 μM)/Zn2+ (5 μM) solution (red line) and
after dipping in Pb2+/Zn2+ solution treated
with mats for 24 h (green line) and for 48 h (blue line). Q-bands
region is shown in the inset.

Using H2T4 deposited on glass to monitor the ionic residual
concentration,
we can confirm the partial removal of both ions as indicated by increased
intensity and narrowing of component at λ = 433 nm and presence
of component at λ = 500 and 575 nm attributable to PbT4 and
ZnT4 species, respectively (Figure 10b). These results point to a decreased selectivity,
at T = 20 °C, of PES–TiO2 mats
toward adsorption of Zn2+ and Pb2+ when both
species are present in solution.

Different adsorption performances
are achieved if temperature is
increased to T = 35 °C, as shown in Figure 11.

spectra of H2T4 (1 μM) solution
(black line) at T = 35 °C: after dipping in
Pb2+ (5 μM)/Zn2+ (5 μM) (red line)

with PES–TiO2 mats for 1 h (green line) and for
5 h (blue line). (b) UV–vis absorption spectra of H2T4 on glass

and after dipping in Pb2+/Zn2+ solution treated
with PES–TiO2 mats for 1 h (green line) and for
5 h (blue line). Q-bands region is shown in the inset.

Figure 11a shows
H2T4 (1 μM) Soret band modification behavior after addition
in Zn2+/Pb2+ solution, before and after treatment
with PES–TiO2 mats. It is clear how high temperature
promotes ZnT4 formation via Pb2+–Zn2+ transmetalation; in fact, a clear red shift of H2T4 Soret band associated
with metalated derivative is well evident (red line). After 1 h dipping
of PES–TiO2 mats, a remarkable decrease of the component
at λ = 476 nm is due to a faster adsorption of Pb2+ with respect to Zn2+ (green line), while the other component
remains still red shifted with respect to free base reference. After
5 h, Pb2+ is almost totally removed and, for this reason,
transmetalation is slowed down. However, presence of low concentration
of PbT4 is indicated by a Soret band intensity (now centered at λ
= 423 nm) lower than that referred to porphyrin-free base (black line).
Validation of hypothesis of a reduced adsorption of Zn2+ with respect to Pb2+ is provided by spectral analysis
of H2T4 deposited on glass (Figure 11b). In this case, an evident modification of the Soret
band shape, after 1 h mats dipping, clearly indicates the presence
in solution of [Zn2+] = 5 μM (see Figure 8 for comparison), whereas Pb2+ concentration is dramatically reduced and estimated close
to ∼1 μM. By prolonging dipping time, [Zn2+] slightly decreases by formation of a well discernible component
at λ = 432 nm having same intensity as that at λ = 450
nm associated to ZnT4. Spectral changes in Q-bands region confirm
the invariance of [Zn2+] as indicated by predominance of
component at λ = 575 nm (green line) whose intensity slightly
decreases after 5 h (blue line).

Discussion
Lead
selective adsorption provided by the investigated polymeric
mats is significantly higher on PES–TiO2 fibers
(Figure 5) than on
PES ones (Figure 3).
Modulation of PES–TiO2 surface charge by varying
pH (from 5.5 to 8) is verified by adsorption performances toward cationic
H2T4 (Figure 4). In
fact, TiO2 IEP (∼6) triggers surface charge from
positive (below IEP) to negative (above IEP).25 Hydroxylated bridging groups and terminal groups on oxide surface,
which can be positively charged (−OH–H+)
or negatively charged (−O–), are progressively
deprotonated upon increasing pH, forming negative surface charge.
These functional groups are responsible for coordinative interactions
with metal ions that “interfere” with protonation equilibrium  At neutral
pH, ion complexation is responsible
for both physisorption and chemisorption on PES–TiO2 fibers.35 The overall surface charge
of fibers, at neutral pH, favors binding of metal ions to hydrous
amorphous oxide through interaction at the solid surface–solution
interface. Accordingly, these processes are triggered by many factors
that influence the resulting surface complexing constant. In particular,
stability of aqua ions and their acidity need to be accounted for.
In fact, divalent metal ions undergo hydrolysis in water; thus, this
equilibrium in homogeneous solution can compete with formation of
hydroxo complexes at solid surface.36

Noteworthy, working at room temperature (≈20 °C), PES–TiO2 fibers show a high selectivity toward Pb2+ rather
than Zn2+; no significant decrease of Zn2+ concentration
in solution is observed even if dipping time of PES–TiO2 mats is prolonged up to 48 h. Zn2+ ions are hydrolyzed
at pH higher than Pb2+, and this condition can explain
their lower affinity toward amorphous TiO2 surface.37,38 Upon increasing temperature, Zn2+ adsorption is increased
due to the endothermic nature hydrolysis and surface adsorption onto
TiO2 surface; thus, this evidence supports the role of
chemisorption process in both Pb2+ and Zn2+ ions
adsorption on PES–TiO2 mats surface, since generally
physisorption should decrease upon increasing temperatures. In fact,
adsorption at surface hydroxyl sites can be discussed in terms of
formation of coordination bond, resulting from an electron lone pair
donation of surface oxide ion to metal ions. Of course, electrostatic
nature of adsorption process is supported by considerations about
hydration energy and stability of an aqua ion in solution (proportional
to Z/r ratio), which can be invoked
to explain Zn2+ reduced adsorption36 on TiO2 surface. In particular, it has to be remarked
how chemical reactivity of the aqua ions is connected with stability
of the intermediate products formed during ion coordination of water
molecules exchange with ligands (i.e., M(H2O)52+); in the present case, Zn2+ penta-coordination
tendency can explain its inertia.

Conclusions
A
combined adsorption–detection approach to treat heavy
metal ions dispersed in water has been proposed. The presented results
have been shown in the preliminary study aimed to demonstrate ability
of PES–TiO2-based mats to work as heavy-ion sorbent.
The approach proposed to monitor Pb2+ and Zn2+ removal is based on the use of porphyrins as molecular probes, which
are able to reveal ion concentration below ppm. The presented approach
allows for a real-time detection and removal of trace lead in wastewater
without the requirement of expensive and complex instrumentation,
such as atomic absorption spectroscopy or inductively coupled plasma
(ICP) spectroscopy.

Electrospun PES-based fibrous mats are validated
as effective sorbent
material to be used in water without any drawback related to their
dispersion and contamination in solution. After treatment, in fact,
they can be easily removed out from solution, and any filtration or
purification procedure is further required. Addition of titanium isopropoxide
to PES electrospun solution leads to hybrid PES–TiO2 mats, whose negative surface charge, easily modulated by pH, promotes
an enhanced adsorption of metal ions with respect to bare PES. A remarkable
difference in term of affinity toward Zn2+ and Pb2+ ions is observable at room temperature (T = 20
°C). In particular, PES–TiO2 mats are able
to drop Pb2+ concentration without interference of Zn2+ ions. On the contrary, upon increasing temperature (T = 35 °C), both species are readily removed out from
water. In particular, ion removal is almost complete (>90%) at
35
°C, after 5 h dipping (corresponding to a removal of ∼1.3
mg/g for Pb2+ and 0.5 mg/g for Zn2+).39

This behavior remarks the importance of
aqua ion’s coordination
chemistry to rationalize selective adsorption of metal ions on hydroxylated
surface, thus pointing to a more complex phenomena description rather
than mere system electrostatics.

Noteworthy, ability of PES–TiO2-based electrospun
fibrous mats to absorb lead and zinc ions present in water has been
investigated using cationic H2T4 as metal ion chemosensor. Homogeneous
(in 1 μM aqueous solution) and heterogeneous (onto glass surface)
H2T4 core metalation both provide clear spectroscopic evidences to
sense metal ions presence in water (at sub-micromolar concentration).
For this reason, very low metal ion (Pb2+ and Zn2+) initial concentrations (∼1 ppm) are used to confirm the
ability of H2T4 probes used both as diluted solution and deposited
monolayers on glass, to detect residual ion concentration at sub ppm
level. Such values are much lower than those conventionally used (>100
ppm) to calculate sorption capability and, in this regard, it is also
important to remark that sorption capability depends on initial metal
ion concentration. In fact, it has been demonstrated that an increase
in the initial metal ion contributes to overcome mass transfer resistance
between solid/solution interfaces.40,41

The
fabricated mats are extremely stable in water, easy to handle,
and robust, thus allowing for a prolonged use (up to complete removal
of ionic species) without any release of both fibrous material as
well as adsorbed species.

In this perspective, we believe that
the proposed hybrid PES–TiO2 mats represent scalable
and versatile solutions for application
in water remediation. Their ability to adsorb heavy metal ions represents
a specific functionality that can be combined also to photocatalytic
properties of the material to obtain active membranes for wastewater
treatment.

Experimental Section
Materials
Commercial poly(ether
sulfone) (PES) with
a molecular mass of about 20 000 Da was chosen for membrane
production. Dimethylformamide (DMF), toluene, titanium isopropoxide
(TIIP), and acetylacetone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (H2T4), Pb(NO3)2, and Zn(NO3)2 were used
without further purification. All stock solutions were prepared by
dissolving the solid in ultrapure water obtained from the Elga Purelab
Flex system by Veolia.

H2T4 stock solution (1 × 10–4 M) was prepared
by dissolving the solid in ultrapure water at pH 7. H2T4 1 μM
solutions (ε422 = 2.34 × 105) were
prepared directly in cuvettes by adding microliter aliquots of the
stock solution to 2.5 mL of water (pH = 7).

Pb(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2 stock solutions
(1 × 10–3 M) were prepared
in ultrapure water at pH = 7 directly from the solid.

Fibrous Mats
Preparation
PES solutions were obtained
by dissolving 2.5 g of polymer in a DMF/toluene (1:1) solution: the
mixture was stirred continuously for 3 h at 40 °C. A second solution
was prepared by mixing 2.5 mL of toluene, 1.5 mL of TIIP, and 1 mL
of acetylacetone and stirring for 3 h under nitrogen flow. This latter
solution was slowly added to former polymer solution and stirred overnight
under nitrogen flow. Then, it was loaded into a 10 mL syringe mounted
on a peristaltic pump (flow rate 20 μL/min) and electrospun:
distance between the needle tip and collector was kept at 15 cm and
voltages were set at +18 and −3 kV, respectively.

Metals Adsorption
Lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) and zinc nitrate
(Zn(NO3)2) were dissolved
in deionized water at room temperature. Electrospun fibers (20 cm2, weight ≈ 40 mg) were dipped in 20 mL of resulting
solutions (pH = 7) where initial concentration of Pb2+ and/or
Zn2+ ions was set at 5 μM. Dipping time is varied
from 1 h up to 48 h and temperature from 20 to 35 °C.

After
dipping, 2.5 mL aliquots of treated solutions were analyzed by adding
25 μL of H2T4 stock solution to estimate residual metal concentration.
No filtration is required for any solution withdrawals.

Spectrophotometric
Metal Ion Detection in Water Using H2T4 in
Solution or Immobilized on Glass
H2T4-treated glass was used
to directly monitor metal residual concentration in treated solution,
thus avoiding porphyrin dispersion in water. Microscopic glass slides
(Forlabs; Carlo Erba, cut into 2.5 cm2 pieces) were sonicated
in water, isopropyl alcohol, and ultrapure water before use.

H2T4 deposition is achieved by dipping glass slides into H2T4 solutions
(10 μM) at pH 5.5 for 45 min: afterward glass slides were rinsed
with water to remove the excess of porphyrin. The amount of H2T4 deposited
on glass has been spectroscopically calculated by desorption experiments
(in sodium dodecyl sulfate solution at 10%w) and estimated
to be ∼3 × 10–7 M.

UV–visible
spectra were obtained on a JASCO V-560 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. All of the measurements were performed at room
temperature and under an atmospheric pressure. UV–vis spectra
of H2T4 deposited on glass were recorded from λ = 700 to 350
nm (data pitch 0.5 nm; band width 2.0 nm; scanning speed 100 nm/min)
before and after dipping (time ranging from 1 to 48 h) in the water
containing the residual Pb2+ and/or Zn2+ after
fibers PES–TiO2 treatment.

SEM analysis was
performed using a Field Emission Supra ZEISS VP
55 microscope equipped with an Oxford 10 mm2 SDD Detector
for energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).
