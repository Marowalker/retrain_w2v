Numerous
anti-mucin 1 (anti-MUC1) antibodies that recognize O-glycan core structures have already been developed. However,
most of them show low specificities toward O-glycan
structures and/or low affinity toward a monovalent epitope. In this
study, using an MUC1 glycopeptide library, we established two novel
anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibodies (1B2 and 12D10) with designed carbohydrate
specificities. Compared with previously reported anti-MUC1 antibodies,
1B2 and 12D10 showed quite different features regarding their specificities,
affinities, and reactivity profiles to various cell lines. Both antibodies
recognized specific O-glycan structures at the PDT*R
motif (the asterisk represents an O-glycosylation
site). 1B2 recognized O-glycans with an unsubstituted O-6 position of the GalNAc residue (Tn, T, and 23ST), whereas
12D10 recognized Neu5Ac at the same position (STn, 26ST, and dST).
Neither of them bound to glycopeptides with core 2 O-glycans that have GlcNAc at the O-6 position of
the GalNAc residue. Furthermore, 1B2 and 12D10 showed a strong binding
to not only native MUC1 but also 20-mer glycopeptide with a monovalent
epitope. These anti-MUC1 antibodies should thus become powerful tools
for biological studies on MUC1 O-glycan structures.
Furthermore, the strategy of using glycopeptide libraries should enable
the development of novel antibodies with predesigned O-glycan specificities.

Introduction
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a
high-molecular-weight membrane-associated glycoprotein.
The extracellular domain of MUC1 includes a variable number of 20-amino-acid
tandem repeats and high-density O-glycosylation.
MUC1 is expressed on the surface of the apical site of normal epithelial
cells. In tumor cells, several changes of MUC1 occur. For example,
in these cells, MUC1 is expressed all over the cell surface, exhibits
increased expression, and its glycosylation pattern also changes.1,2 Previously, O-glycan profiles of MUC1 were analyzed
using human milk and tumor tissue,3 advanced
breast cancer patients’ serum,4 and
normal breast epithelial cell lines and breast carcinoma cell lines.5,6 The obtained results showed that breast cancer cells had a lower
level of core 2 O-glycans of MUC1 than normal breast
epithelial cells. Conversely, glycans with Neu5Ac or an unsubstituted
state at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue were
expressed at higher levels in breast cancer cells than in normal breast
epithelial cells.

To study MUC1 glycosylation, monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) that
have high specificity for O-glycan structures are
powerful tools. Indeed, many anti-MUC1 antibodies have already been
established. For example, human milk fat globule 1 (HMFG1),7 PankoMab,8 VU-2G7,9 and KL-610 were produced
using human mammary milk fat globule, desialylated MUC1 from human
breast cancer, MUC1 glycopeptide, and human lung adenocarcinoma as
antigens, respectively. Thus, cells, mucins, and synthesized glycopeptides
were used as the antigens of MUC1 antibodies. Several anti-MUC1 antibodies
recognized not only the core peptide but also O-glycans.
More than 10 years ago, it was difficult to determine the precise
carbohydrate epitopes that the anti-MUC1 antibodies recognized. In
our previous study, an MUC1 glycopeptide library was developed; using
this library, we elucidated the PDT*R motif with a 23ST carbohydrate
structure to be epitope of the anti-MUC1 antibody KL-6.11 Another anti-MUC1 antibody 5E5 also showed the
glycan–peptide specificity (Tn and STn at the GST*A region).12 In addition, high-throughput analysis of glycan
specificities using a glycan microarray has been developed in recent
years13−15 and applied to the analysis of the epitopes of various
anti-MUC1 antibodies. The binding analysis of anti-Tn monoclonal antibodies
with the array of synthetic saccharides and glycopeptides determined
the detailed glycan specificities.16 However,
most of them did not have apparent glycan specificities. Furthermore,
they showed tandem-repeat-dependent binding and weak binding to monovalent
epitopes, despite being strongly bound to the antigen with multivalent
epitopes.17 As a reason for these characteristics,
it was considered that most of the previously reported anti-MUC1 antibodies
were produced using the cells or mucin glycoproteins as antigens,
which include various glycan structures. In some cases, synthesized
MUC1 glycopeptides were used as antigens,12 but anti-MUC1 antibodies with well-predesigned glycan specificity
have not been reported.

To overcome the problems associated
with this, in this study, we
generated two novel anti-MUC1 antibodies with predesigned epitopes
using synthesized MUC1 glycopeptides as antigens and an MUC1 glycopeptide
library and native MUC1 for antibody screening (Figure 1 and Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report describing the generation of antibodies with a predesigned
glycan specificity of the core region of O-glycans
at the site of attachment in the immunogen and strong affinity to
a monovalent epitope as well as tandem-repeating multivalent MUC1
glycoproteins.

Results
Design
of Carbohydrate Specificities for Novel MUC1 Antibodies
Previous
studies that have reported on MUC1 O-glycan
analysis of various samples derived from breast cancer and normal
cells3−6 are summarized in Table 2. Figure 2 presents
the biosynthetic pathway focused on the glycans at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue. MUC1 O-glycans
of milk serum and a normal breast cell lines contained an abundance
of core 2 glycan structures. On the other hand, MUC1 O-glycans of tumor tissue and cancer cell lines contained glycans
with no sugar substitution (Tn, T, and 23ST) or Neu5Ac (STn, 26ST,
and dST) at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue.
We focused on the difference in MUC1 glycans between normal and tumor
tissues and attempted to generate two novel anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibodies
that strictly recognize the glycans at the O-6 position
of the GalNAc residue. The criteria for the two novel antibodies are
that neither of them recognizes the core 2 structure; one antibody
recognizes glycans with an unsubstituted O-6 position
of the GalNAc residue (Tn, T, and 23ST) and the other antibody recognizes
glycans with Neu5Ac at the same position (STn, 26ST, and dST).

b MUC1 was
expressed as recombinant
protein in T-47D cells.

The MUC1 core peptide (HGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPA) contains five putative O-glycosylation sites. The PDT*R region (asterisk indicates
a glycosylated amino acid) is known to be immunodominant, and many
anti-MUC1 antibodies recognize this region.18 In this study, we also focused on this region and designed two types
of glycopeptides: PDT*R-23ST-20-mer and PDT*R-STn-20-mer.

Generation
of Anti-MUC1 Monoclonal Antibodies
As immunogens,
MUC1 glycopeptides (PDT*R-23ST-20-mer and PDT*R-STn-20-mer) were conjugated
with carrier proteins, immunogen-1 (PDT*R-23ST-20-mer–bovine
serum albumin (BSA) conjugate) and immunogen-2 (PDT*R-STn-20-mer–keyhole
limpet hemocyanin (KLH)). To obtain high-affinity antibodies against
a monovalent epitope, we performed screening by capture enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using biotinylated PDT*R-23ST-20-mer or
biotinylated PDT*R-STn-20-mer.

Using immunogen-1, we selected
four hybridoma clones (1B2, 2A2, 7B6, and 13H5) that bound to PDT*R-23ST-20-mer
(Table 3A). Among
them, 7B6 and 13H5 bound to the nonglycosylated peptide (MUC1 peptide
40-mer) and did not have designed specificity. The rest of the antibodies
(1B2 and 2A2) did not bind PDT*R-23ST6SL-20-mer containing GlcNAc
at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue. Furthermore,
1B2 showed a stronger binding to the native MUC1 protein fraction
from the breast cancer cell lines (T-47D) than 2A2. We finally selected
1B2 (IgG2a, kappa) as an anti-MUC1 antibody recognizing glycans with
an unsubstituted O-6 position of the GalNAc residue.

In a similar way, anti-MUC1 antibodies recognizing
Neu5Ac at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue
were selected. Using
immunogen-2 (PDT*R-STn-20-mer–KLH conjugate), we selected four
hybridoma clones (12D10, 3F12, 12H5, and 13E8) that bound to PDT*R-STn-20-mer
(Table 3B). Among
them, 3F12 bound the nonglycosylated peptide (MUC1 peptide 40-mer)
and did not have designed specificity. The remaining antibodies (12D10,
12H5, and 13E8) did not bind to either PDT*R-23ST6SL-20-mer containing
GlcNAc at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue
or the nonglycosylated peptide (MUC1 peptide 40-mer). Out of these
three antibodies, 12D10 showed the strongest binding to the native
MUC1 protein fraction from the breast cancer cell lines (T-47D). 12D10
did not bind the glycopeptide (GVT*S-STn-20-mer) that was glycosylated
at a different site from PDT*R by capture ELISA (Figure S1). We finally selected 12D10 (IgG1, kappa) as an
anti-MUC1 antibody recognizing the glycans with Neu5Ac at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue.

Characterization of Novel Anti-MUC1 Antibodies
(1B2 and 12D10)
The glycan specificities, affinities, and
tandem-repeat dependence
of 1B2 and 12D10 were compared with those of the already-known anti-MUC1
antibodies. The glycan specificity of anti-MUC1 antibodies was assessed
in detail by competitive ELISA using the MUC1 glycopeptide library
(Table 4 and Figure S2). Both 1B2 and 12D10 recognized the
glycans attached to the PDT*R motif of the MUC1 peptide. One of these
antibodies, 1B2, bound to glycans with an unsubstituted O-6 position of the GalNAc residue (Tn, T, and 23ST) but did not bind
to glycans in which this position was substituted, such as core 2
glycans or STn. The other antibody, 12D10, bound to glycans with Neu5Ac
at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue (STn, 26ST,
and dST) but neither to core 2 glycans nor to glycans with an unsubstituted O-6 position of the GalNAc residue. We also investigated
the glycan specificity of several previously reported anti-MUC1 antibodies
(PankoMab, VU-2G7, and KL-6). VU-2G7 bound to the PDT*R motif with
any glycan but did not show obvious glycan specificity. As reported
previously, KL-6 bound to the glycans containing 23ST attached to
the PDT*R motif but did not distinguish between core 1 and core 2.
PankoMab recognized the glycans with the unsubstituted O-6 position of the GalNAc residue attached to the PDT*R motif, as
well as 1B2. However, PankoMab showed more cross-reactivities with
core 2 glycans than 1B2 (Figure S2).

Table 4 Glycan Specificities of Anti-MUC1
Monoclonal Antibodies Determined by Competitive ELISAa
a Specificities of anti-MUC1 antibodies
are presented as cross-reactivity (%). Various glycopeptides were
used as competitors against PDT*R-23ST-20-mer for 1B2, PankoMab, VU-2G7,
and KL-6 and against PDT*R-STn-20-mer for 12D10.

The binding affinities (KD) for synthetic
100-mer glycopeptides or native MUC1 were measured by Biacore. Anti-MUC1
antibodies were injected over glycopeptides or a native MUC1 immobilized
sensor chip. The kinetic constants were calculated using a bivalent
binding model (Table 5A). For synthetic glycopeptides (PDT*R-Tn-100-mer peptide or PDT*R-STn-100-mer
peptide), 1B2 and 12D10 showed much higher affinities (KD of 0.4 and 1.7 nM, respectively) than PankoMab and VU-2G7
(KD of more than 180 nM). For native MUC1,
1B2 and 12D10 also had higher affinities than the previously reported
antibodies. For a monovalent epitope, the affinities of anti-MUC1
antibodies including KL-6 were estimated using the IC50 values from competitive ELISA (Table 5B). 1B2, 12D10, and KL-6 showed a strong binding to
monovalent MUC1 glycopeptides (IC50 of 1.2, 2.6, and 7.5
nM, respectively), but PankoMab and VU-2G7 bound more weakly (IC50 of more than 280 nM).

Table 5 Binding Affinities
of Anti-MUC1 Antibodies
a Biacore analysis
of KL-6 was not
performed because purified KL-6 was not available.

MUC1 contains a tandem repeat of
20 amino acids (HGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPA).
Therefore, to investigate the tandem-repeat dependence of the binding
of anti-MUC1 antibodies, we synthesized MUC1 glycopeptides with different
lengths (PDT*R-Tn-20-, 40-, 60-, and 100-mer and PDT*R-STn-20-, 40-,
60-, and 100-mer) and tested the reactivities of anti-MUC1 antibodies
by ELISA. For 100-mer glycopeptides, 1B2 and 12D10 demonstrated ELISA
signals higher than 1.0 at an antibody concentration of 10 ng/mL,
whereas PankoMab and VU-2G7 needed an antibody concentration of more
than 500 ng/mL to obtain the same ELISA signals. Furthermore, PankoMab
and VU-2G7 bound in a tandem-repeat-dependent manner because these
antibodies showed increased ELISA signals depending on the length
of the MUC1 glycopeptides. In contrast, 1B2 and 12D10 bound in a tandem-repeat-independent
manner (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Tandem-repeat
dependence of anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibodies. The
binding of MUC1 antibodies to MUC1 glycopeptides with different lengths
was determined by ELISA. The concentrations of MUC1 antibodies used
in ELISA are presented under the graph. *1: tested using PDT*R-Tn;
*2: tested using PDT*R-STn.

Although the tandem-repeat dependence of KL-6 was not investigated,
it was suggested that KL-6 bound strongly to a monovalent epitope
because the IC50 of KL-6 (7.5 nM) as determined by competitive
ELISA was comparable to that of 1B2 and 12D10 (Table 5B).

Comparison of Reactivity of Anti-MUC1 Antibodies
to Cell Lines
We investigated the reactivity of anti-MUC1
antibodies to several
cell lines and examined its relationship with the expression levels
of MUC1 and glycosyltransferases. Five human cell lines were used
in this study. These included breast cancer cells (T-47D) and mammary
epithelial cells (184A1) derived from human mammary gland, as well
as lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3), mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells
(H292), and lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) derived from
human lung.

First, we checked the expression levels of MUC1
protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) (Figure 4). We found correlations between the protein
and mRNA expression levels of MUC1. T-47D showed the highest expression
levels of MUC1 among these five cell lines.

Figure 4 (A) Quantification of
MUC1 protein in cell lines was performed
using CA15-3 ELISA. CA15-3 is presented as unit per milligram of protein
of the cell lines. (B) The mRNA level of MUC1 was determined by reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

We also investigated the expression levels of glycosyltransferases
(C2GnT1, ST6GalNAc1, ST6GalNAc2, and ST3Gal1) in Figure 5. C2GnT1, ST6GalNAc1, and ST6GalNAc2
are important enzymes for the synthesis of branched glycans at the O-6 position of the GalNAc residue. C2GnT1 generates core
2 O-glycans. ST6GalNAc1 and ST6GalNAc2 are involved
in the synthesis of STn and 26ST. On the other hand, ST3Gal1, which
catalyzes the addition of Neu5Ac to the O-3 position of Gal, contributes
to the synthesis of 23ST.

Figure 5 Relative transcript abundance of glycosyltransferases
in cell lines
was determined by RT-PCR analysis. Data were normalized by the amount
of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. Relative
expression level was less than 0.01; N.D.: not detected.

C2GnT1 was most highly expressed in 184A1 but hardly
expressed
in T-47D. The expression levels of ST6GalNAc1 and ST6GalNAc2 varied
from cell to cell. ST3Gal1 was highly expressed in all of the cell
lines tested.

The binding of anti-MUC1 antibodies to cell lines
was examined
using a flow cytometer (Figure 6). PankoMab and VU-2G7 bound only to T-47D, which showed the
highest expression level of MUC1, but hardly bound to the other cell
lines. This could have been due to the weak affinity of these antibodies,
which require multivalent epitopes for strong binding.

Figure 6 The binding of MUC1 antibodies
to cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis
enabled the creation of histograms of MUC1 antibodies binding to cells
(filled green), and each histogram was overlaid for comparison with
isotype control antibodies (filled magenta).

In contrast, KL-6 bound to all of the cell lines. KL-6 strongly
bound to monovalent MUC1 glycopeptide containing 23ST regardless of
the substitution status at the O-6 position of the
GalNAc residue. Because the expression levels of ST3Gal1 were high
in all of the cell lines, O-glycans containing the
23ST structure (KL-6-reactive O-glycans) were expected
to be abundant in these cell lines.

A novel anti-MUC1 antibody,
1B2, showed a strong binding to T-47D
and H292, weak binding to 184A1, and no binding to A549. Although
the specificity of 1B2 was similar to that of PankoMab, the reactivity
to H292 differed between 1B2 and PankoMab. The high affinity showed
by 1B2 to monovalent MUC1 glycopeptide was probably due to the much
lower expression level of MUC1 or density of the essential epitope
in the MUC1 tandem-repeat in H292 than that in T-47D.

Another
novel anti-MUC1 antibody (12D10) showed strong binding
to T-47D and Calu-3, weak binding to H292, and no binding to 184A1
and A549. Interestingly, in T-47D and Calu-3, the expression levels
of ST6GalNAc1 and ST6GalNAc2 were higher than that of C2GnT1 (Table 6). There could be
competition between ST6GalNAc and C2GnT1 regarding the synthesis of
branched O-glycans at the O-6 position
of the GalNAc residue, although the localization of these enzymes
in Golgi and the expression level of Cosmc (C1GalT1-specific chaperon)
should be also considered.19,20 This suggested that
the O-glycan structures containing the Neu5Ac at the O-6 position
of the GalNAc residue (STn, 26ST, and dST), which are essential for
the binding of 12D10, might be abundant in T-47D and Calu-3.

Table 6 Relationship between Ratio of Glycosyltransferase
Expression Levels and Relative Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI)
As described above, the characteristics
of binding of novel anti-MUC1
antibodies (1B2 and 12D10) to various cell lines appeared to be different
from those of already-known anti-MUC1 antibodies such as PankoMab
and VU-2G7.

Discussion
In O-glycan structures, there are various kinds
of tumor-related antigens and differentiation antigens, and substantial
research about these antigens has been conducted using monoclonal
antibodies over the last 30 years.21,22O-Glycan antigens are generally divided into two types. One group
(sialyl-LewisA, LewisX, and sialyl-LewisX) is located at the nonreducing terminal and commonly located
in glycolipids.23,24 The other group (Tn, STn, and
T) is located at the core region and unique to O-glycans.25,26 The study of monoclonal antibodies against glycan antigens on the
nonreducing terminal has advanced because the isolation and detection
of glycolipids was well developed compared with those of glycoproteins,
and isolated glycolipids are useful tools for epitope determination
because they retain immunogenicity.27 Furthermore,
using purified glycolipids or synthesized glycolipids as immunogens,
it is possible to obtain anti-glycolipid monoclonal antibodies with
a prospectively designed epitope recognition.28

However, it has been difficult to generate anti-glycan antibodies
that recognize the unique structures at the core region of O-glycans. This is because of the difficulty of purifying O-glycans and the complex epitopes that often contain a
peptide portion coupled with O-glycans.18,27 If O-glycans are released from peptides, the immunogenicity
is sometimes lost.27

Previously,
two monoclonal antibodies, MLS102 (anti-STn) and MLS128
(anti-Tn), were raised using colorectal cancer cells (LS 180) as the
immunogen.29,30 In these previous studies, antibody
screening was performed using a solid-phase immunoassay utilizing
immobilized glycopeptides prepared from the cells. The epitopes of
these antibodies were determined to be ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM)31,32 because a large amount of OSM could be prepared for the determination
of the epitope. Another group reported monoclonal antibodies (TKH1
and TKH2) directed to O-linked STn epitope by immunizing mouse with
OSM.33 However, it was generally difficult
to reveal the precise epitopes and the specificities of antibodies
recognizing both O-glycan and peptide using limited
amounts of the naturally occurring glycoproteins having heterogeneous O-glycoforms.

To overcome this difficulty, synthetic
glycopeptide libraries of
MUC1 have recently been developed.34 A
microarray on which the glycopeptide library is immobilized makes
it easier to determine the epitope of MUC1 antibodies in a high-throughput
manner.13−16,35 To accelerate O-glycan research further, it is desirable to generate anti-O-glycan antibodies with prospectively designed specificity
in the same way as anti-glycolipid antibodies. However, in the past,
whole cells and mucins were mostly used as immunogens,7,8 so it has been difficult to make antibodies that recognize the core
region structure of O-glycans with defined specificities.
Actually, many anti-MUC1 antibodies recognized the core region structure
of O-glycans attached to the PDT*R motif, but most
of them exhibited unclear glycan specificities. VU-2G7, which was
established using the glycopeptide PDT*R-Tn-60-mer, required O-glycan attached to PDT*R for its binding, but did not
have clear specificity (Table 4).

In addition, PankoMab, which was established using
desialylated
MUC1 as the immunogen, showed specific binding to tumor cells. Clinical
trials of PankoMab for the treatment of cancer are now underway.36 In our study, PankoMab recognized glycans attached
to the PDT*R region, especially O-glycan with an
unsubstituted O-6 position of the GalNAc residue.
As another example of a known anti-MUC1 antibody, KL-6 was established
using human lung adenocarcinoma as immunogen, and its antigen is a
useful diagnostic marker of interstitial pneumonia. KL-6 was shown
to bind to the glycan containing the 23ST structure in both core 1
and core 2.11 The binding of PankoMab and
VU-2G7 was found to occur in a tandem-repeat-dependent manner (Figure 3). This might be
due to the effect of the avidity because the binding affinities of
all of these antibodies were weak against monovalent glycopeptides
(Table 5). It was reported
that another anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibody, SM3, which was generated
with a partially deglycosylated MUC1 as an immunogen, recognized PDTR
motif.37,38 SM3 showed a tumor-specific histological
staining pattern.37 More interestingly,
overexpression of C2GnT1 in T47D cells (normally making core 1-based
structures) resulted in the loss of binding of SM3 to MUC1, accompanied
by a decrease in the GalNAc/GlcNAc ratio, indicative of a switch to
core 2 structures. Therefore, loss of the SM3 binding to MUC1 is apparently
due to the core 2 branch masking the polypeptide PDTR motif recognized
by SM3.39 Thus, SM3 showed interesting
features; however, it was also reported that the binding of SM3 was
found to occur in a tandem-repeat-dependent manner.17 To study the alteration of MUC1 core glycans, it was necessary
to establish novel MUC1 antibodies with high specificity and strong
affinity for a monovalent glycopeptide epitope distributable in the
natural heterogeneous MUC1 glycoprotein.40

Using a synthetic MUC1 glycopeptide library, in this study,
we
produced a new class of MUC1 monoclonal antibodies with prospectively
designed specificities. Previously, it was reported that the core
2 glycans decreased in human breast cancer. Therefore, as a model
study, we designed two kinds of monoclonal antibodies that do not
bind to core 2 glycans. One monoclonal antibody recognizes glycans
with an unsubstituted O-6 position of the GalNAc
residue (Tn, T, and 23ST), whereas the other recognizes glycans with
Neu5Ac at the same position (STn, 26ST, and dST); neither of these
mAbs binds to core 2 O-glycans.

To obtain mAbs
with a strong binding affinity toward both glycans
and immunodominant peptide structures, several important points should
be borne in mind: (a) the monovalent (20-mer) synthetic MUC1 glycopeptides
were used as immunogens, (b) the antibody was screened by capture
ELISA using biotinylated glycopeptides, and (c) the reactivities not
only to glycopeptides but also to native MUC1 were evaluated. After
cell fusion, several hybridoma clones that exhibited binding to the
immunogen glycopeptides were obtained, but some clones showed a lack
of specificity for O-glycan structures and/or bound
weakly to native MUC1. It has been reported that MUC1 derived from
T-47D includes large amounts of short form-based O-glycans (Table 2).
Therefore, it was important to test not only O-glycan
specificities using synthetic glycopeptides but also binding reactivities
using native MUC1 or macromolecular MUC1 models40 in the antibody-screening step for the antibodies with
designed glycan specificities.

Finally, we established two novel
MUC1 antibodies, 1B2 and 12D10.
The epitope of 1B2 was found to be similar to that of PankoMab, which
recognized core glycans with an unsubstituted O-6
position of the GalNAc residue and did not bind to glycopeptides with
core 2 O-glycans. However, 1B2 showed higher glycan
specificity than PankoMab (Figure S2).
In addition, the binding of 1B2 occurred in a tandem-repeat-independent
manner, which differed from that of PankoMab. The epitope of 12D10
was the core glycans with Neu5Ac at the O-6-position of the GalNAc
residue. 12D10 did not bind to the MUC1 glycopeptide with core 2 O-glycans. Although numerous MUC1 antibodies have already
been studied, no MUC1 antibody with the same glycan specificity as
12D10 has been reported.

Several anti-MUC1 antibodies that recognize
sites other than the
PDT*R motif have been reported. For example, anti-MUC1 antibody (MY.1E12)
was obtained using human milk fat globule (HMFG) as an immunogen and
shown to recognize GVT*S-23ST. However, its binding affinity was weak
(KD of 140 nM), and its glycan specificity
was not fully elucidated.41 Another anti-MUC1
antibody (5E5) was obtained using MUC1 60-mer peptides with five GalNAc
per tandem repeat (MUC160-Tn15) as an immunogen. This antibody recognized
GST*A with Tn or STn, which was not substituted at the O-3 position
of the GalNAc residue, and 5E5 was considered to be a tandem-repeat-dependent
antibody.12

X-ray analysis of glycopeptide
and antibody crystal structures42 and NMR
analysis of glycopeptides43 help to know
the conformation properties. Both
of which can be useful to gain further understanding of the molecular
recognition between anti-MUC1 antibodies (1B2 and 12D10) and glycopeptides.

In this study, the reactivities of anti-MUC1 antibodies to several
cell lines were examined. Among existing anti-MUC1 antibodies tested,
PankoMab and VU-2G7 showed little or no binding to the cell lines
with a low expression level of MUC1. This is probably because these
antibodies showed low binding affinities to a monovalent glycopeptide
epitope.

In contrast, KL-6 with high affinity to a monovalent
glycopeptide
epitope bound to all of the tested cell lines. KL-6 recognized not
only core 1 but also core 2 O-glycans including the
23ST structure. Furthermore, ST3Gal1, which is important for the synthesis
of 23ST, was highly expressed in all of the cell lines. These features
might have contributed to the broad binding profiles of KL-6 against
various cell lines.

The novel anti-MUC1 antibodies (1B2 and
12D10) showed different
profiles from known anti-MUC1 antibodies (PankoMab, VU-2G7, and KL-6)
regarding the reactivities to cell lines. This result reflects the
characteristics of 1B2 and 12D10 with high glycan specificity and
high affinities to monovalent epitopes. Therefore, it is expected
that 1B2 and 12D10 may become useful tools for the biochemical studies
of MUC1 O-glycans.

To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report about the
generation of antibodies with predesigned glycan specificity of the
core region of O-glycans at the site of attachment
in the immunogen and strong affinity to a monovalent epitope as well
as tandem-repeating multivalent MUC1 glycoproteins. The strategy reported
here might also be applicable to the generation of antibodies against O-glycan core structures of various mucin-type glycoproteins
other than MUC1. The carbohydrate antigens Tn and STn are expressed
in most carcinomas; however, it has been reported that many important O-glycan core structures lack a corresponding antibody,44 and there is a need to develop novel antibodies
with improved specificities targeting STn or Tn attached at the target
immunodominant peptide.45 Recently, a combinatory
antibody–antigen microarray assay for high-content screening
of phage antibodies was reported.46 Our
strategy also should make it possible to develop novel antibodies
against O-glycan core structures that could not be
obtained by previous approaches using cells or glycoproteins as immunogens.

Materials
and Methods
Anti-MUC1 Antibodies
PankoMab (Glycotope, Germany),
VU-2G7 (MONOSAN, Netherlands), and KL-6 (EIDIA, Japan) were purchased
as reagents. PankoMab and VU-2G7 were used as purified antibodies;
however, KL-6 was not available as a purified antibody.

Cell Lines
Human breast cancer cells (T-47D), human
lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3), human mucoepidermoid carcinoma
cells (H292), and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549)
were purchased from American type culture collection (ATCC) and cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
Human mammary epithelial cells (184A1) were purchased from ATCC and
cultured in mammary epithelial cell basal medium supplemented with
bovine pituitary extract, epidermal growth factor, insulin, and hydrocortisone
in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Preparation of Native MUC1
Fraction from T-47D Supernatant
T-47D was cultured for 3
days in FBS-free medium. The medium was
harvested and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000g and
filtered over 0.22 μm bottle-top filters. Then, the medium was
changed to 50 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 7.4) and concentrated
using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-100
membrane (Millipore, Germany). Next, the native MUC1 fraction was
biotinylated using NHS-PEG4-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.

Synthesis of Glycopeptides
All of the glycopeptides
were synthesized as reported previously.11,34,39 The glycopeptides used in this study are
summarized in Table 1.

Preparation of Immunogen-1 (PDT*R-23ST-20-mer–BSA Conjugate)
To Raise Anti-MUC1 Antibodies Recognizing O-glycans
with an Unsubstituted O-6 Position of the GalNAc Residue
HGVTSAPD (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc) TRPAPGSTAPPA (PDT*R-23ST-20-mer)
was modified by sulfo-SMCC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to make maleimide-activated
glycopeptide. The sulfhydryl groups were introduced to BSA by the
reaction with sulfo-LC-SPDP (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sulfhydryl-activated
BSA was incubated with the maleimide-activated glycopeptide. The reaction
mixture was dialyzed against distilled water and then freeze-dried
(immunogen-1: Figure 1).

Preparation of Immunogen-2 (PDT*R-STn-20-mer–KLH Conjugate)
To Raise Anti-MUC1 Antibodies Recognizing O-glycans
with Neu5Ac at the O-6 Position of the GalNAc Residue
HGVTSAPD
(Neu5Acα2-6GalNAc) TRPAPGSTAPPA (PDT*R-STn-20-mer) was incubated
with Imject Maleimide-activated KLH (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction
mixture was dialyzed against distilled water and then freeze-dried
(immunogen-2: Figure 1).

Generation of Anti-MUC1 Antibodies
Female Balb/c, 4–6
week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of
the immunogen emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (Difco,
Franklin Lakes, NJ). The immunization was repeated with the immunogen
emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant three times at 3
week intervals.

Hybridomas were generated by fusing the spleen
cells with P3U1 murine myeloma cells following the standard protocol.
The hybridomas were cultured in medium containing hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine.
Supernatants were collected from the cloned hybridoma cultures and
examined for reactivity to MUC1 glycopeptides by capture ELISA, as
described in the later sections, and then hybridomas were cloned by
limiting dilution. Antibodies purified by protein A affinity chromatography
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were used for the detailed characterization
of anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibodies (1B2 and 12D10). The isotype of
monoclonal antibodies was determined using a Mouse Immunoglobulin
Isotyping ELISA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Assessment
of the Binding Activity of Developed Antibodies to
MUC1 Glycopeptides
Anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Shibayagi,
Japan) was diluted (10 μg/mL) into 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH
7.5), and 35 μL of aliquots was added to each well of a 384-well
MaxiSorp plate (Nunc, Waltham, MA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C.
After being washed, the plate was blocked with 90 μL of Block-Ace
(DS Pharma Biomedical, Japan) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
Then, 15 μL of anti-MUC1 antibodies was added and incubated
for 3 h at room temperature. After being washed, 15 μL of biotinylated
peptides (0.01 ng, PDT*R-23ST-20-mer or PDT*R-STn-20-mer) and streptavidin–horseradish
peroxidase (HRP, 2 ng, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was placed in each
well of the plate and the plate incubated overnight at 4 °C.
After another wash, the plate was incubated with 25 μL of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) Plus-substrate-Chromogen (DAKO, Santa Clara, CA) as the substrate
solution for HRP for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 25 μL of 0.5 M sulfuric acid, and
the absorbance at 450 nm was determined using an EnVision Multilabel
plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).

Assessment of the Specificity
of Developed Antibodies Using
Competitive Inhibition ELISA
Anti-mouse IgG (Shibayagi) was
diluted (10 μg/mL) into 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), and
35 μL of aliquots was added to each well of a 384-well MaxiSorp
plate (Nunc) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After being washed,
the plate was blocked with 90 μL of Block-Ace (DS Pharma Biomedical)
and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Then, 15 μL of anti-MUC1
antibodies was added and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. After
being washed, 15 μL of biotinylated peptide (0.01 ng, PDT*R-23ST-20-mer
or PDT*R-STn-20-mer), competitor (MUC1 glycopeptides), and streptavidin–horseradish
peroxidase (2 ng) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C.
After another wash, the plate was incubated with 25 μL of TMB
Plus-substrate-Chromogen (DAKO) as the substrate solution for HRP
for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition
of 25 μL of 0.5 M sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 450 nm
was determined by an EnVision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer).

Assessment of the Binding Affinity of Anti-MUC1 Antibodies
The binding affinity of anti-MUC1 antibodies was measured with
a Biacore T100 surface plasmon resonance instrument (GE Healthcare,
England) and is expressed as the equilibrium constant (KD). Biotinylated MUC1 glycopeptide (PDT*R-23ST-100-mer
or PDT*R-STn-100-mer) or the biotinylated native MUC1 fraction was
immobilized on an SA chip (GE Healthcare). Anti-MUC1 antibodies were
injected over the MUC1 glycopeptide- or native MUC1 fraction-immobilized
surfaces. Three kinetic parameters, the association rate constant
(ka), the dissociation rate constant (kd), and the equilibrium dissociation constant
(KD), were obtained with BIAevaluation
3.1 software (GE Healthcare) using a bivalent binding model. The KD value (KD = kd/ka) was used to
evaluate the binding affinity of the antibodies.

Evaluation
of the Tandem-Repeat Dependence of Anti-MUC1 Antibodies
The
tandem-repeat dependence of anti-MUC1 antibodies was analyzed
by ELISA as described in later sections. Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was diluted (10 μg/mL) into 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), and 35 μL of aliquots was added to each well of a
384-well MaxiSorp plate (Nunc) and incubated overnight at 4 °C.
After being washed, the plate was blocked with 90 μL of Block-Ace
(DS Pharma Biomedical) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
Then, 15 μL of biotinylated MUC1 glycopeptides (PDT*R-Tn-20-,
40-, 60-, 100-mer or PDT*R-SRn-20-, 40-, 60-, 100-mer) was placed
in each well of the plate and the plate was incubated overnight at
4 °C. After being washed, 15 μL of anti-MUC1 antibodies
was added. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the plate was
washed again, supplemented with 15 μL of HRP-labeled anti-mouse
IgG (GE Healthcare), and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After
a further wash, the plate was incubated with 25 μL of TMB Plus-substrate-Chromogen
(DAKO) as the substrate solution for HRP for 30 min at room temperature.
The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 M sulfuric acid and
the absorbance at 450 nm was determined using an EnVision Multilabel
plate reader.

Quantification of MUC1 Protein in Cell Lines
The protein
fraction of cell lines was extracted using Protein and RNA Extraction
Kit for mammalian cells (Takara Bio, Japan), in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. The quantification of MUC1 protein
in the extracted protein fractions was determined using CA15-3 ELISA
(Abcam).

Quantification of Transcript Levels of MUC1 and Glycosyltransferases
in Cell Lines
RNA was extracted from the cell lines using
Protein and RNA Extraction Kit for mammalian cells (Takara Bio), in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. A reverse
transcription reaction was carried out using SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-time quantitative PCR
was implemented using the specific primers listed in Table S1 and SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio) on an ABI
7500 Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The expression
levels of glycosyltransferase and MUC1 were normalized against the
housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
The primers for GAPDH were from the Human Housekeeping Gene Primer
Set (Takara Bio).

Flow Cytometry
Cells were grown
in DMEM with 10% FBS.
After 48 h of growth, the cells were trypsinized and washed once in
PBS containing 10% FBS. Cells (1.0 × 106) were resuspended
in 200 μL of anti-MUC1 antibody solutions. After 2 h of incubation
on ice, the cells were incubated in 200 μL of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled
anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h on ice. After three
washes, the cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 10% FBS.
The analysis was performed with FACS Aria (BD Biosciences), and flow
cytometric data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TOMY Digital
Biology, Japan).
