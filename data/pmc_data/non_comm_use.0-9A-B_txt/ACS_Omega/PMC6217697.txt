Formaldehyde
(FA), as a reactive carbonyl species and signaling
molecule, plays an important role in living systems. Here, an FA-responsive
probe with fast response and great selectivity is designed based on
aggregation-induced emission. The probe is prepared by functionalizing
tetraphenylethene (TPE) with two amine groups. FA is detected based
on the solubility differences between the amine-functionalized TPE
and the corresponding Schiff bases after reaction with FA. The probe
exhibits a limit of detection of 40 nM and a response time of ∼90
s. Furthermore, its ability to detect both endogenous and exogenous
FA is demonstrated in living cells with high specificity. Moreover,
the probe is also introduced to image endogenous FA in real time with
fast response. These results suggest that our probe holds great potential
for tracking FA in living systems under various physiological conditions
as well as related biomedical applications.

Introduction
Formaldehyde (FA) is
a common hazardous molecule that can be generated
from various natural and anthropogenic sources. As a reactive carbonyl
species, it can also be endogenously generated via various biological
processes, including one-carbon metabolism, metabolite oxidation,
demethylation events, epigenetic modifications, and so forth.1−4 FA is also an important signaling molecule that is involved in promoting
proliferation and mediating memory formation. However, aberrant elevations
of FA concentrations are associated with various pathological states
such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.5−7 Therefore, FA is delicately balanced between production and consumption
in biological systems to maintain proper cellular functions. For instance,
the intracellular concentration of FA was maintained in the range
of 1.5–4.0 μM.8 Because of
its significance in physiological and pathological processes, it is
essential to develop new methods to track FA concentrations in living
cells.

Fluorescent probes are emerging as powerful tools for
tracking
trace small molecules in living systems.9−12 Currently, there are mainly two
types of reactivity-based probes for detecting intracellular FA, which
were designed by harnessing the relatively strong electrophilicity
of the carbonyl group. The first type was designed by masking aldehyde
fluorophores with a homoallylamine moiety. FA was detected based on
a 2-aza-Cope rearrangement which subsequently hydrolyzed to aldehyde
fluorophores with activated fluorescence.13−16 A self-immolative linker was
further incorporated to improve design versatility.17,18 However, the reaction kinetics of these probes toward FA is rather
slow, and several hours (2–3 h) are generally required to obtain
a decent signal-to-background ratio. Their long response time severely
hindered real-time tracking of FA fluctuation in biological systems
as the half-life of FA is approximately 90 s in organisms.19 Alternatively, smart designs of FA probes with
fast kinetics were developed based on the photoinduced electron-transfer
mechanism by using the reactions between FA and hydrazine or amines.20−22 Though displaying rapid responses in vitro within 10 s to 30 min,
these probes suffered from less desirable selectivity and were susceptible
to interfering reactions with other aldehydes such as acetaldehyde.
Moreover, these probes displayed a rather sluggish response to FA
in living cells. Because of the transient and reactive nature of FA,
it is still highly desirable to develop fluorescent probes that can
monitor FA fluctuations in living cells with fast response, high sensitivity,
and great selectivity.

Herein, we develop a novel strategy for
designing a fluorescence
probe for FA based on the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) that
features fast response, favorable selectivity, and high sensitivity.
Molecules with typical AIE attributes, nonemissive in dilute solution
but highly emissive in the aggregated status, have been widely introduced
for bioimaging and biosensing.23−25 We envision that the decreased
aqueous solubility of Schiff bases as compared to that of amine groups
can be utilized to design a fluorescent probe for FA based on the
AIE phenomenon. On the basis of this rationale, we design the FA-responsive
AIE probe, AIE-FA, by introducing two FA-reactive amine groups in
tetraphenylethene (TPE), a well-known AIE luminogen (Scheme 1). The two amine groups not
only function as the reactive moieties for FA but also increase its
aqueous solubility. AIE-FA is nonfluorescent in the dissolved state.
Upon condensation with FA, the amine groups are converted to Schiff
bases, resulting in poor solubility and the formation of aggregated
products, which turns on the fluorescence signals because of the restriction
of the intramolecular rotation-induced energy dissipation pathway.26 To our knowledge, this is the first time that
AIE is used in the design of fluorescence probes for detection and
imaging of FA. It is demonstrated that AIE-FA exhibits ultrafast response
kinetics, high sensitivity, and great selectivity toward FA in vitro.
Live cell studies reveal that AIE-FA is capable of imaging endogenous
and exogenous FA in living cells. Additionally, the ability of AIE-FA
to image endogenous FA in real time is also demonstrated. These advantages
may endow our AIE-FA probe with great potential for long-term tracking
of FA concentrations in living systems under different physiological
conditions.

Imaging
Results and Discussion
In Vitro
Characterizations
On the basis of the above
rationale, two probes for FA were synthesized by functionalizing TPE
with one amine moiety (TPE-NH2) and two amine moieties
(AIE-FA) (Scheme S1). The intermediates
and final compounds were confirmed with 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy (MS) (Figures S1–S8). After synthesizing these two probes, we began to examine that
the fluorescence emission spectra of AIE-FA and TPE-NH2 were obtained in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), with different
volume fractions of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). AIE-FA displayed an
evident fluorescence peak at 530 nm when the volume fraction of DMSO
was smaller than 10% (Figure S9). In contrast,
there appeared a distinct fluorescence emission peak at 490 nm when
the volume fraction of DMSO was smaller than 30% for TPE-NH2 (Figure S10). The emergence of fluorescence
emission peaks was due to the AIE phenomenon. These results indicated
that AIE-FA was in the dissolved state when the volume fraction of
DMSO was larger than 10%, while the volume fraction of DMSO should
be larger than 30% for TPE-NH2 to be in its dissolved state.
Then, their responses toward FA were investigated. AIE-FA was essentially
nonfluorescent in PBS buffer, supplemented with 10% DMSO, attributed
to the two hydrophilic amine groups which improved its aqueous solubility.
However, upon addition of 15 μM FA, there was a ∼12-fold
fluorescence enhancement at 530 nm (Figure 1a). This was probably because the amine groups
were converted to less aqueous soluble Schiff bases upon a condensation
reaction with FA, which activated fluorescence due to a typical AIE
phenomenon. The AIE characteristics of the product were further investigated
via measuring fluorescence emission in a PBS/DMSO binary system. There
was gradual increase in fluorescence as the volume fractions of PBS
increased, displaying a typical AIE phenomenon (Figure S11).27 In addition, there
was also a slight red shift and increase in absorbance after reaction
with FA, shifting from 325 to 350 nm (Figure S12). This bathochromic shift was probably due to the formation of Schiff
bases which extended the π-conjugated structure. These results
indicated that AIE-FA could be a potential FA probe. By contrast,
TPE-NH2 exhibited only a 1.7-fold increase in fluorescence
in PBS, supplemented with 30% DMSO (Figure S13). Therefore, AIE-FA was chosen for further studies because of its
better aqueous solubility and larger fluorescence enhancement.

spectra of AIE-FA and AIE-FA + FA (15 μM).
(b) Selectivity of AIE-FA toward different relevant species in PBS,
supplemented with 10% DMSO: (1) CH3CHO (5 μM), (2)
CHOCHO (5 μM), (3) CH3COCHO (15 μM), (4) H2O2 (100 μM), (5) cysteine (1.0 mM), (6) glutathione
(10 mM), (7) NaCl (100 mM), (8) KCl (50 mM), (9) NaHSO3 (200 μM), and (10) FA (15 μM).

The selectivity of AIE-FA toward FA was then investigated.
AIE-FA
was treated with various possible interfering substances in physiological
conditions including acetaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, hydrogen
peroxide, cysteine, glutathione, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride.
The fluorescence spectra were then obtained. There was negligible
fluorescence increase at 530 nm for all of the tested substances,
except for acetaldehyde, which exhibited an approximately 2.2-fold
fluorescence enhancement at concentrations of 5 μM (Figure 1b). Particularly,
the negligible fluorescence enhancements at 530 nm upon incubation
with physiological relevant concentrations of KCl and NaCl implied
that AIE-FA was stable without appreciable aggregation. In contrast,
treatment with FA at 15 μM resulted in a ∼12-fold fluorescence
enhancement. These results indicated that AIE-FA exhibited high selectivity,
holding great potential in detecting FA in physiological conditions.

Then, pH effects on AIE-FA and its response to FA were also investigated.
AIE-FA was essentially nonfluorescent in pH ranging from 6.8 to 9.0.
After reacting with FA, a distinct fluorescent enhancement was observed
in the pH range of 4.0–9.0 (Figure 2a). The slight decrease in fluorescence for
pH smaller than 6.8 might be due to the slow hydrolysis of the Schiff
base at acidic conditions.28,29 These results indicated
that our probe could be introduced to detect FA in physiological pH.
The reversibility of AIE-FA toward FA was also investigated by
adding NaHSO3 to the reaction product of AIE-FA and FA.
The fluorescence intensity decreased by ∼90%, suggesting that
the reaction between AIE-FA and FA was reversible (Figure S14 in
the Supporting Information). Afterward,
the response times of AIE-FA toward various concentrations of FA (0,
0.5, 5.0, and 15 μM) were then studied by recording the fluorescence
signals at 530 nm in real time. The fluorescence emission was rapidly
increased upon the addition of FA, reaching a plateau within 90 s
for 15 μM FA (Figure 2b). This rapid response might be attributed to fast reaction
kinetics between amine moieties and FA.15 This rapid reaction rate would permit our probe to track transient
FA in biological systems.

or without FA (10 μM) in buffers with different pH values (pH

10% DMSO. (b) Real-time fluorescence responses of AIE-FA (10 μM)
to different concentrations of FA (0, 0.5, 5.0, and 15 μM).

After demonstrating that AIE-FA
afforded a fast response and excellent
selectivity toward FA, its ability to quantify FA concentrations was
then investigated. As shown Figure 3a, the fluorescence signals exhibited dynamic increase
in response to increasing concentrations of FA in the range of 100
nM to 15 μM. A signal-to-background ratio as high as ∼12
was achieved across this concentration range. This dynamic range spanned
over the intracellular FA concentrations of 1.5–4.0 μM,
indicating its potential in imaging intracellular FA.8 Moreover, a linear correlation between the fluorescence
signals to the FA concentration was obtained in the range of 100 nM
to 1 μM with a detection limit estimated to be 40 nM (Figure 3b). Such a low detection
limit implied that the AIE-FA afforded the highest sensitivity for
FA detection among existing fluorescence probes.13−16

in PBS, supplemented with 10% DMSO. (b) Fluorescence intensity at
530 nm as a function of FA concentrations and linear fit between the
fluorescence intensity and the concentration of FA (inset).

Reaction Mechanism Validation
To confirm the reaction
mechanism, the reaction product of AIE-FA with FA was first verified
with 1H NMR. The signals related to the protons on the
amine groups of AIE-FA (chemical shift = 5 ppm) disappeared after
reaction with FA (Figure 4a,b). Meanwhile, downfield was also observed for the ortho-
and metaprotons on the amine-substituted aromatic rings of AIE-FA
after reaction. These results indicated that the amine groups reacted
with FA (Figure 4a,b).
The reaction products of AIE-FA and FA were further confirmed by ESI
analysis. There appeared a new peak upon reaction with FA, corresponding
to the Schiff base derivatives, (calcd for C28H22N2 [M + H]+m/z, 387.2; found, 387.2). These results provided clear evidence that
AIE-FA reacted with FA via a typical condensation reaction (Figure S15).

FA Imaging in Living Cells
Having demonstrated that
AIE-FA could detect FA with fast response, high sensitivity, and high
selectivity in vitro, its ability to track endogenous FA in living
cells was then investigated, using HeLa cells as a model cell line.
First, the cytotoxicity of the AIE-FA was studied with a WST-1 assay.
The cells had over 90% viability for concentrations of AIE-FA up to
30 μM for 24 h, indicating that AIE-FA is highly biocompatible
(Figure S16). Then, AIE-FA was introduced
to detect endogenous and exogenous FA in HeLa cells. AIE-FA (10 μM)
was incubated with HeLa cells for 1 h, and fluorescent images were
then acquired with confocal microscopy after washing twice with PBS.
There was evident fluorescence emission from the HeLa cells, indicating
that AIE-FA could detect endogenous FA (Figure 5a1–a3 and S17). Afterward, the ability of AIE-FA to detect exogenous FA was demonstrated
by adding 5.0 μM of FA to AIE-FA incubated HeLa cells. There
was an approximately twofold enhancement in fluorescence as compared
to that of the cells without the addition of FA (Figures 5b1–b3 and S18). These results indicated that AIE-FA could
detect both endogenous and exogenous FA in living cells. Moreover,
the inhibitory experiment was also performed to test probe specificity.
Sodium bisulfide (NaHSO3) was chosen as the inhibitor because
it could react with carbonyl of FA.19,20 There was
a dramatic decrease in the fluorescence signal for HeLa cells pretreated
with NaHSO3 (200 μM) (Figure 5c1–c3). This was due to the consumption
of intracellular FA by NaHSO3. In addition, the colocalization
assay using Lyso-Tracker red revealed that AIE-FA did not specifically
localize in lysosomes (Figure S19 in the Supporting Information). All together, these results indicated that AIE-FA
could track FA in living cells with high sensitivity and high specificity,
holding great potential for interrogation of the roles of FA in biology.

To investigate whether
AIE-FA could image endogenous FA in real
time, confocal fluorescence images were obtained at different time
points after the addition of AIE-FA (Figure 6). There was no fluorescence signal before
the addition of AIE-FA. With the addition of AIE-FA, there was evident
fluorescence enhancement within 30 s. The fluorescence signals were
gradually increased and became stable in ∼5 min (Figure S20
in the Supporting Information). This rapid
increase in fluorescence indicated that AIE-FA could readily diffuse
into cells and reacted with FA, generating fluorescence signals. The
saturated fluorescence signal within 5 min indicated that our probe
could rapidly reflect the endogenous FA concentrations. These results
demonstrated that our probe could monitor FA concentrations in living
cells with fast response and high sensitivity.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed an AIE-based fluorescence sensing
strategy for ultrasensitive and ultrafast detection of FA. By utilizing
the aqueous solubility differences between amine-functionalized AIE
and the Schiff base-modified AIE after reaction with FA, a highly
sensitive and rapid assay for FA was readily achieved. The probe was
demonstrated to possess rapid response, great selectivity, and high
sensitivity toward FA in vitro. The ability of AIE-FA to image both
endogenous and exogenous FA with high sensitivity and specificity
was also demonstrated in living cells. Moreover, AIE-FA exhibited
a fast response toward FA in real time in living cells. We believe
that AIE-FA would hold great potential in sensing FA concentrations
in living systems under various physiological conditions.

In Vitro Assay
and Cytotoxicity Study
A stock solution
of AIE-FA (100 μM) was prepared with PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4), supplemented
with 10% DMSO. A stock solution of TPE-NH2 (100 μM)
was prepared with PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) TPE-NH2 and AIE-FA
with final concentrations of 10 μM were used throughout the
in vitro experiments. A final concentration of 10 μM was used
for FA, unless otherwise indicated. PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) was used for
all of the dilutions. Fluorescence spectra were recorded in the range
of 390–710 nm, with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. The
excitation and emission slit widths were both 5 nm.

The cytotoxicity
of AIE-FA against HeLa cells was studied using a WST-1 cell proliferation
and cytotoxicity assay following the kit protocol. Briefly, cells
were incubated with various concentrations of AIE-FA (0–30
μM) for 24 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and treated
with WST-1 in PBS for 4 h. Cell viability was determined by measuring
the absorbance at 450 nm with a Microplate Reader.

Fluorescence
Imaging of Living Cells
HeLa cells were
grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin
(100 U/mL), and penicillin (100 U/mL) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were cultured on a 35 mm Petri dish
with a 10 mm bottom well in a folate-free RPMI-1640 medium for 24
h, and then the dishes were washed with PBS three times.

For
imaging endogenous FA, AIE-FA (10 μM) was added to HeLa cells
and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Images were obtained after washing
twice with PBS. For imaging exogenous FA, AIE-FA (10 μM) was
first added to HeLa cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently,
the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 5.0 μM FA
for another 0.5 h at 37 °C before imaging acquisition. To perform
the inhibition experiment, NaHSO3 (200 μM) was first
added to HeLa cells. Then, the cells were incubated with AIE-FA (10
μM) for 1 h before imaging acquisition. The imaging experiments
were performed with three passages of cells, and three fields were
imaged for each sample. For imaging endogenous FA in real time, one
fluorescence image was obtained before the addition of AIE-FA. Then,
fluorescence images were obtained at various time points (0, 30, 90,
180, 270, and 330 s) after the addition of AIE-FA. For colocalization
assay, the prepared cells were incubated in 1 mL cell growth medium
supplemented with Lyso-Tracker red for 20 min. After washing with
PBS three times, AIE-FA was incubated with HeLa cells for 10 min,
and then confocal fluorescence images of Lyso-Tracker red was obtained
with an excitation wavelength of 559 nm and a collection channel of
590–640 nm. All of the fluorescence images were acquired using
an oil objective lens of 100×, on an inverted confocal laser
scanning fluorescence microscope equipped with an Olympus FV1000 confocal
scanning system (Olympus IX81). An Ar+ laser (405 nm) was
used as the excitation source, and a band pass filter (480–570
nm) was used for acquiring fluorescence images of cells incubated
with AIE-FA. Maximum intensity projections were acquired for all of
the imaging experiments. For imaging analysis, three ROIs of designated
sizes were analyzed with ImageJ software.
