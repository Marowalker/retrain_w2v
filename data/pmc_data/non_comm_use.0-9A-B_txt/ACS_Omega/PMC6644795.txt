The nanoscale interpenetrating network
of active layer plays a
key role in determining the exciton dissociation and charge transport
in all small-molecule nonfullerene solar cells (AS-NFSCs). However,
fabricating interpenetrating networks in all small-molecule blends
remains a critical hurdle due to the uncontrolled crystallization
behavior of small molecules. In this study, we proposed that the balanced
crystal size between the donor and the acceptor is an essential prerequisite
to construct optimal interpenetrating networks. We also provided a
solvent additive strategy to reduce the gap of crystal size between
the donor and the acceptor in S-TR:ITIC all small-molecule blend system
through manipulating the solution state and film-forming kinetics.
As a result, the crystal size of S-TR decreased and the crystal size
of ITIC increased, leading to nanoscale interpenetrating networks.
This optimized morphology improved the exciton dissociation efficiency
and suppressed the bimolecular recombination, achieving almost double
power conversion efficiency compared to the reference device. This
work demonstrates that manipulation of the balanced crystal size of
donor and acceptor may be a key to further boost the efficiency of
AS-NFSCs.

Introduction
All small-molecule
nonfullerene solar cells (AS-NFSCs), based on
the binary blend of small-molecule donors (SMDs) and nonfullerene
small-molecule acceptors (NFAs), are of interest due to lots of virtues
over conventional polymer/fullerene devices including easily tunable
energy levels, well-defined chemical structure, high purity, and stable
batch quality.1−5 Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of AS-NFSCs have
reached ∼10%, with high short-circuit current density and open-circuit
voltage.4 However, as far as we know, the
PCE of the state-of-the-art AS-NFSCs is still lower than those of
their polymeric counterparts.6−8 The restriction to obtain high
device performance may be the lack of optimal phase separation. As
we know, the ideal morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) should
involve interpenetrating network of phase-separated domains with large
interfacial areas between donor and acceptor, and the dimension should
be comparable to the exciton diffusion length.9−11 However, in
comparison with the case of polymer/fullerene or polymer/polymer-based
solar cells, achieving a bicontinuous phase structure in AS-NFSCs
is very challenging due to narrower processing windows because small
molecules are more sensitive to casting conditions.4,12,13

Typically, the phase-separation process
occurs either by a spinodal
decomposition mechanism or nucleation and growth mechanism. The bicontinuous
phase separation structures could be selectively controlled by spinodal
decomposition in the blend systems with dynamic symmetry.14−16 However, for the blend systems contained conjugated molecule, the
phase separation dynamic process is usually prone to be asymmetric due
to the large difference between intermolecular interaction and/or
crystallinity of the two components, resulting in a large number of
complex and uncontrollable phase morphologies.16,17 Furthermore, owing to the strong π–π interaction
among donor and acceptor molecules, the phase-separation process usually
is accompanied by crystallization. When phase separation and crystallization
occur simultaneously, the final morphology is mainly determined by
the competition of crystallization between the donor and the acceptor.16,18 Fortunately, regulating the crystallization behavior of both donor
and acceptor is an efficient way to control the morphology in crystallization/crystallization
blend system.

It is known that the balanced crystallization
between donor and
acceptor is an important premise to fabricating bicontinuous phase-separation
structures or interpenetration networks. According to this principle,
the polymer donors with high crystallinity appear to match better
with fullerene acceptors due to the easy crystallization of fullerene.
However, for the NFAs (usually, NFAs have low crystallinity compared
to fullerene), polymer with weak crystallinity should be selected
as the donor to achieve good device performance. For example, PffBT4T-2OD
(high crystallinity) can yield a PCE of 10.8% when blended with fullerenes.
However, blending PffBT4T-2OD with SFPDI2 (NFAs) could only result
in a low PCE of ∼3%. Alternatively, great enhancement in PCE
can be achieved by reducing the crystallinity of the polymer.19−21 Similar phenomenon can be found in all the polymer blend systems
as well. Ma et al. synthesized a series of donor–acceptor polymers
with different crystallinity by introducing different building blocks
and side chains. They found that when the crystallinity of the donor
and acceptor were resemble, the interpenetrating network could be
obtained and a PCE of 6.0% could be achieved.22

Although the works about morphology control in AS-NFSCs blend
systems
are rarely reported, and how the crystallinity of both donor and acceptor
affects the phase separation structure of the blend is also obscure.4,23 Furthermore, the variation trend in the crystallinity of the donor
and acceptor is prone to follow the same trend, i.e., their crystallinities
are simultaneously enhanced or reduced by using the traditional processing
strategies, such as thermal annealing23 and solvent vapor annealing.4 There is
lack of novel processing strategies to independently control the crystallinity
of SMDs and NFAs, for example, suppressing the crystallinity of one
component and enhancing the crystallinity of the other component at
the same time.

In this work, we proposed that the balanced crystal
size between
the donor and the acceptor is an important prerequisite to construct
the interpenetrating network for AS-NFSCs. Additionally, the independent
control of the crystallinity for the donor and the acceptor was also
realized by tuning the solution state and film-forming kinetics. Here,
BDTT-S-TR (S-TR) was selected as the donor and ITIC was chosen as
the acceptor. Due to the large difference in the crystal size between
S-TR and ITIC in the blend system, i.e., the crystal size of S-TR
(LD) is 16 nm and the crystal size of
ITIC (LA) is 0, the phase separation was
dominated by the crystallization of S-TR, thus forming a grain-like
phase-separation structure. To balance the crystal size, the solvent
additive chloronaphthalene (CN) was well selected: on one hand, the
crystallinity of S-TR was suppressed due to the increased nucleation
barrier in the solution, resulting in a decreased LD (13 nm). On the other hand, the crystallization of ITIC
was retarded during the film-forming process, which reduced the disturbance
of S-TR on the self-organization of ITIC, leading to an enlarged LA (9.2 nm). The balanced crystal size between
S-TR and ITIC induced the formation of interpenetrating network. The
optimized morphology facilitates the dissociation of exciton and suppresses
the bimolecular recombination during charge transport process, leading
to an improved device performance. Our work raised the principle for
how to optimize the morphology of AS-NFSCs and also provided a method
to individually control the crystallinity of the donor and the acceptor,
which could extend the ideal pair of SMDs and NFAs.

Results and Discussion
Due to the tremendous difference in the crystallinity between S-TR
and ITIC, the morphology of pristine S-TR:ITIC blend film is dominated
by the crystallization of S-TR, which suppresses the aggregation of
ITIC, leading to a grain-like phase-separation structure. This structure
is not suited for the exciton dissociation in S-TR phase, and also
leads to a poor charge transport in the ITIC phase. To fabricate an
interpenetrating structure, a balanced crystal size between S-TR and
ITIC should be obtained. Here, we adopted CN as a solvent additive
to decrease the crystal size of S-TR and enhance the crystal size
of ITIC because of the optimized solution state and film-forming kinetics,
resulting in an optimal interpenetrating network structure.

Balancing Crystal
Size To Fabricate Interpenetrating Network
Herein, we adopted
a small-molecule material S-TR with high crystallinity
as the donor and ITIC with low crystallinity as the acceptor; the
molecular structures and energy levels are displayed in Figure 1A. The UV–vis absorption
spectrum of S-TR:ITIC film is shown in Figure 1B. The blend film has a very broad absorption
from 400 to 780 nm. The absorption around 420–650 nm is mainly
attributed to S-TR and the absorption around 650–780 nm is
mainly caused by ITIC (Figure S1A).8,24 After adding CN, two obvious differences appears. First, the absorption
shoulder peak centered at 586 nm gradually blueshifts to 575 nm, indicating
a decreased aggregation of S-TR. Second, the intensity of absorption
shoulder peak around 706 nm gets stronger than the film without CN,
which means increased crystallinity of ITIC. The changed aggregated
states were also confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.
According to the PL spectroscopy of the neat films (Figure S1B), it is clear that the peaks centered at 701 and
770 nm are the signals of S-TR and ITIC, respectively. As shown in Figure 1C, the emission intensity
of S-TR decreases, whereas that of ITIC increases, suggesting that
the opposite aggregated state changes in S-TR and ITIC after adding
CN. Usually, the changed trend of aggregated state for donor and acceptor
in the NFSM-OSC blend system is always similar when the film undergoes
the traditional post-treatment.4,25 The opposite change
tendency we observed in this experiment is rarely reported before,
and we will discuss the mechanism in detail in the following sections.

structures and energy levels of S-TR and ITIC. (B)
UV–vis absorption spectra and (C) PL spectroscopy of S-TR:ITIC
blend films processed without and with different contents of CN.

The changed aggregated states
are usually induced by crystallization,
so we characterized the molecular packing and crystal texture by grazing
incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) as shown in Figure 2.26 For the pure S-TR film, not only a strong (100) diffraction
signal located at 0.32 Å–1 along the vertical
(qz) axis, but the (200),
(300), and (400) diffraction patterns could also be observed (Figure 2A), revealing the
highly crystalline structure on lamella stacking and a strong preference
for edge-on orientation. For the ITIC film, a weak lamellar (100)
peak located at 0.50 Å–1 and a π–π
stacking (010) diffraction signal located at 1.50 Å–1 were observed along the qz axis as shown
in Figure 2B, which
indicates that ITIC has a weak crystallinity and adopts both edge-on
and face-on orientation in the film.27

patterns of (A) neat S-TR, (B) neat ITIC films, and S-TR:ITIC
blend films processed without CN (C), with 1% CN (D), 3% CN (E), and
5% CN (F).

For the S-TR:ITIC blend film,
the GIWAXS (Figure 2C) shows obvious diffraction patterns of
S-TR, whereas the diffraction of ITIC could not be observed. It indicates
that S-TR crystallized in a similar manner as in the neat S-TR film
in the blend system. However, the crystallization of ITIC is totally
inhabited after blending with S-TR. The crystal sizes for both S-TR
and ITIC were calculated as well (Figure S2). Ade et al. have demonstrated that the crystal size affects the
exciton dissociation and charge transport. Hence, the deep analysis
of crystal size could provide additional details about the relationship
of morphology performance at a nanolength scale.28,29 As shown in Table 1, the crystal size of S-TR (LD) is 16.4
nm, whereas the crystal diffraction signal of ITIC was hardly observed
and the crystal size of ITIC (LA) could
be regarded as 0 nm. For a suitable donor–acceptor blend system,
one primary requirement is the formation of a continuous pathway with
appropriate size for both donor and acceptor. However, in the S-TR:ITIC
blend film, the aggregation of ITIC was inhibited, which is detrimental
for electron transport. Considering the balanced charge transport,
it is necessary to reduce the difference in the crystal size between
S-TR and ITIC. As is well known, the use of CN as processing additives
has emerged as a powerful approach to optimize crystallization in
the bulk heterojunction blend system.30−33 However, the crystallinity of
both donor and acceptor in the reported blend systems always shows
the same variation trend. Take poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT)/N,N-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
diimide (EP-PDI) blend system for instance, the solubility of EP-PDI
and P3HT molecules in the CN solvent is much better than that in chlorobenzene
(CB). Adding CN effectively facilitated the dispersion of EP-PDI molecules
into the P3HT domains, thus inhibiting the crystallization process
of both P3HT and EP-PDI.30 However, in
P3HT/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester blend system,
the addition of CN could promote the formation of a highly crystalline
structure of both donor and acceptor due to the higher vapor pressure
(0.029 mm Hg).33 Surprisingly, CN could
have an opposite effect on the crystallinity of S-TR and ITIC in our
work. It is obvious that the crystallinity of S-TR was decreased,
whereas that of ITIC was enhanced after adding CN, as shown in Figure 2D–F. Furthermore,
the gap in the crystal size between LD and LA was reduced, as shown in Table 1, with LD gradually reduced from 17.2 to 15.1 nm; nevertheless, LA increased from 0 to 12.9 nm, and we will discuss
this phenomenon in the following paragraphs.

The crystallization of donor and/or acceptor governs
the morphology
in many blend systems.34,35 Here, the morphology of S-TR:ITIC
blend films was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figure S3, it is clear that S-TR is more prone to form grain-like
crystals in neat S-TR film, and ITIC tends to form wire-like crystals
in neat ITIC film. In S-TR:ITIC blend film (Figure 3A,a), only a grain-like morphology could
be observed. With increase in the content of CN, the grain-like crystals
gradually disappear. Meanwhile, more wire-like crystals begin to emerge,
thus forming interpenetrating network (Figure 3C,c). When excessive CN exists, large crystals
form and the interpenetrating structure is destroyed again (Figure 3D,d). The changed
morphology should be attributed to the variation in the crystallinity
of both S-TR and ITIC. If the crystallization of S-TR is dominant,
a large and discontinuous phase separation structure would form due
to the strong self-aggregation of S-TR. If the crystallization of
S-TR is restrained and the crystallization of ITIC is promoted, the
crystal size between S-TR and ITIC would be more balanced. Therefore,
the competitive crystallization between S-TR and ITIC would promote
the formation of an interpenetrating structure. Importantly, not only
the morphology but also the carrier mobility indicates the formation
of the complete network. By using the space-charge-limited current
method, the charge-carrier mobilities can be well characterized (as
shown in Figure S4), and the obtained data
are summarized in Table 1.36 For the blend system, the value of
μh decreases to 1.35 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 from
that of 2.36 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1. In contrast, the mobility of electron in
these thin films increases from 1.13 × 10–5 to 3.82 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1. As a result, the lowest μh/μe ratio (3.53) occurs at a CN loading at 3%. The
balanced hole and electron transport indicates the formation of an
interpenetrating network, which should be ascribed to the reduced
difference in the crystal size between the donor and the acceptor.37

Transmission resonant soft X-ray
scattering (RSoXS) was used to
study the phase separation as well.29,38,39 To provide high materials contrast between S-TR and
ITIC, we select the photon energy as 284.2 eV.23 The average scattering sector profiles of the blend films
processed without and with 3% CN are shown in Figure 4. The film without CN shows a peak at q = 0.11 nm–1. We estimated the length
scale of phase separation (ξ) of those referential binary blends
using ξ = 2π/qmode.40 The length scale of 57 nm is found for the film
fabricated without CN. Combined with the GIWAXS, it suggested that
the phase separation in S-TR:ITIC blend system is mainly driven by
the crystallinity of S-TR. However, for the film processed with CN,
no clearly quantifiable peak could be observed in the measured q range, which indicates ξ is too small to be captured.
It is believed that the competitive crystallization between S-TR and
ITIC suppressed the appearance of a large-scale phase separation.
In addition, the relative phase purity can be achieved by calculating
the total scattering intensity through the integration of the scattering
profiles over the q range and taking film thickness
into account.29,40,41 The blend film processed without CN shows a purity of 1, and it
should be noted that the purity of S-TR:ITIC film without CN set to
100% here is only for comparison. Surprisingly, after adding CN, the
phase purity of the blend film dropped to 0.69. Generally, it is suggested
that a high average purity could reduce the bimolecular recombination,
thus improved device performance was obtained. However, if the domain
size is larger than the diffusion length of exciton, which
means the domain purity is too pure (i.e., have insufficient nanomorphology),
and the insufficient percolation pathways usually results in reduced
device performance.42,43 Apparently, in the S-TR:ITIC
blend system, the crystal size of S-TR is too large, which induces
too pure domain. After adding CN, the crystallinity of S-TR and ITIC
was adjusted, thus obtaining an optimized purity, which leads to a
trade-off between exciton diffusion and charge transport.

Optimized Film-Forming
Kinetics Leading to Balanced Crystal
Sizes of Donor and Acceptor
A common approach to optimize
BHJ morphology is to adjust the film-forming kinetics, which has profound
impacts on the film structure, including phase separation, crystallinity,
molecule orientation, and so on. Although lots of research has been
conducted on film-forming kinetics, the process remains a “black
art”, which has not been completely understood. The increased
knowledge about the spin-coating process allows us to optimize the
processing method more efficiently, providing a precise control over
the phase-separation structure.44−46 As we know, the in situ grazing
incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), grazing incidence small-angle
X-ray scattering, and optical experiments are widely applied to gain
insight into the real-time structure evolution during the film-forming
process.44,45 Recently, Richter et al. developed an in
situ photoluminescence (in situ PL). By evaluating the degree of PL
quenching, we can monitor the phase-separation and crystallization
process during the film-forming process.46

Here, we revealed the impacts of CN on the film-forming kinetics
by tracking the PL intensity of both donor and acceptor during the
spin-coating process. According to the PL spectra of pure S-TR and
ITIC film (shown in Figure S2), the PL
emission peak centered at 700 nm corresponds to the aggregation of
S-TR and the signal around
at 780 nm originates from aggregated ITIC. Hence, we recorded the
change in these emission peaks (in situ PL as shown in Figure S5) to monitor the aggregated behavior
of S-TR and ITIC during the spin-coating process. As shown in Figure 5, the PL spectra
of the blend films processed without and with CN were measured. For
the film processed without CN (Figure 5a), as the main solvent, i.e., CB, evaporates, the
PL intensity of both S-TR and ITIC drops, consistent with a decreasing
average distance between S-TR and ITIC (step I: about 0–9 s).47 Then, both S-TR and ITIC show a sharp “dip”
in the PL intensity followed by a recovery, termed here as step II
(about 9–12 s). In this process, the recovery is attributed
to the continuous evaporation of CB. The concentration of the solutes
increases up to the saturated solubility, resulting in aggregates
and phase separation of the solutes. In step III (about 12–24
s), the PL intensities of S-TR and ITIC reach plateaus, which is believed
to be the increased phase purity balanced with the decreased distance
between fluorophores and quenchers. In step IV, the PL intensity decreases
rapidly first and then lowers slowly. We attributed the rapid decrease
in early step IV (from 24 to 37 s) to enhanced crystallinity, which
causes an increase in the exciton diffusion length, leading to an
improved dissociation efficiency of exciton. However, in late step
IV (37 s to the end), the morphology evolution ends with the complete
evaporation of CB, and the gradual decrease in the PL intensity maybe
attributed to the degradation of the film under strong illumination.
It is distinct that the precipitation of S-TR and ITIC occurs at almost
the same time at step II by analyzing the kinetics process. As a result,
S-TR with a high crystallinity would inhibit the aggregation of ITIC
to a certain extent, resulting in a small crystal size of ITIC.

Figure 5 PL spectra
of S-TR:ITIC blend films processed without CN (A) and
with 3% CN (B). The PL intensity (obtained from in situ PL spectra)
vs time recorded during the spin-coating process (a) without CN and
(b) with 3% CN.

In the blend system with
CN, the change tendency of PL intensity
is similar to that in blend system without CN during steps I and IV
process as shown in Figure 5b. Surprisingly, it is different in steps II and III, especially
regarding the PL intensity of ITIC. As we can see, in step II (about
10–19 s), as CB evaporates, S-TR forms aggregate, thus its
PL intensity increases quickly and then reaches a maximum. However,
only a portion of ITIC aggregates and forms crystal nucleus. Although
most of ITIC disperses in the solvent, accordingly, the PL intensity
of ITIC does not reach the maximum. In early step III (about 19–48
s), the PL intensity of ITIC remains constant, whereas in late step
III (about 48–90 s), the PL intensity increased rapidly. This
phenomenon can be attributed to the evaporation of CN, which promotes
the dispersed ITIC to continue to aggregate.

Through a careful
analysis, the working mechanism of CN for optimizing
the morphology in the S-TR:ITIC blend system mainly has two aspects.
First, CN is a selective processing additive, which has a lower solubility
for S-TR (as shown in Table S1). As a result,
S-TR would precipitate out first, i.e., the crystallization of S-TR
and ITIC occurs at different stages, which reduces the interference
of S-TR to the crystallization of ITIC. Second, the film-forming process
was prolonged from about 30–200 s due to the lower volatilization
rate, providing sufficient time for ITIC to self-organize. These two
changes we mentioned above must be the reason for the increased ITIC
crystal size after adding CN. In addition, it is found that adding
CN reduces the S-TR aggregated degree in the solution (the PL peak
of S-TR blueshifts after adding CN as shown in Figure S6), which may inhibit S-TR from nucleating during
the film-forming process, leading to a decreased crystal size.

The study of the film-forming kinetics using in situ PL spectra
is proposed for giving the selection criteria of additive to balance
the crystal size of the donor and the acceptor in AS-NFSCs. First,
the additive has a higher solubility for donor and acceptor than the
main solvent. Second, the additive should have selective solubility
for the component with weak crystallinity. Lastly, the volatilization
rate of the additive should be slower than that of the main solvent.

Relationship between Morphology and Device Performance
To
explore the influence of film morphology on the photoelectronic
property, photovoltaic devices were prepared. The photovoltaic parameters
of the S-TR:ITIC devices processed without and with different contents
of CN are summarized in Table 2 and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the external quantum
efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Figure 6. The device parameters of the S-TR:ITIC
BHJ layers as-cast shows a poor short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), with the power conversion
efficiency (PCE) of only 1.75%. Fortunately, the S-TR:ITIC BHJ layers
processed with CN exhibits a significant enhancement. After adding
3.0% CN, the corresponding device shows a PCE max of 3.59%, an improvement
of about 2 times compared to that of the device without adding CN,
with a JSC of 7.24 mA cm–2, a VOC of 1.00 V, and a FF of 0.50.

The EQE curves are
shown in Figure 6B.
The relative magnitudes of the EQE spectra correlate
well with the JSC values determined from
the J–V curves.48 Although the addition of CN promotes a blueshift
in the UV–vis spectra of S-TR, a prominent improvement can
be observed in the wavelength ranging from 350 to 780 nm after adding
CN. Quantitative analysis of this effect has been performed by integrating
the product of EQE, in which the spectra in the range of 320–620
and 620–780 nm refer to these quantities as JSC:S-TR and JSC:ITIC, respectively
(Table 2). It is found
that both JSC:S-TR and JSC:ITIC exhibit a great increase after adding 3.0% CN.
The increased JSC:S-TR must be partly
caused by the increased exciton dissociation efficiency due to the
blueshifted absorption spectra and the decreased crystallinity of
S-TR. It should be noted that the crystal size correlates with the
smallest pure domain size, which should match with the typical exciton
diffusion length. As we mentioned above, LD was reduced from 16.4 to 14.5 nm after adding CN, promoting the
exciton generated in the S-TR phase to diffuse to the interface and
dissociate. The increased JSC:ITIC may
mainly results from the increased crystal size of ITIC, which promoted
the formation of the electron pathways and enhanced the electron mobility.

The other important reason for the improvement of both JSC:S-TR and JSC:ITIC
is the suppressed bimolecular recombination. The light-intensity dependencies
of the device performances were studied as well to identify the charge
recombination origin. The relationship between JSC and light intensity follows the relation JSC ∝ PS (P is the light intensity and S is the exponential factor). If there is no bimolecular recombination, S factor should be 1, whereas if the bimolecular charge
recombination occurs, S is smaller than 1. As shown
in Figure 6C, the data
are plotted on a log–log scale, and S in the
devices were calculated as 0.89, 0.92, 0.96, and 0.95 for the films
processed without CN and with different contents CN, respectively.
This indicates that the bimolecular recombination was minimized after
adding CN. Without the addition of CN, LA is too small and no continuous pathway is formed for electron transport.
The mismatch in crystal size between S-TR and ITIC could lead to an
imbalance in the carrier transport (μh/μe = 208.9). After adding CN, the crystal size between the donor
and the acceptor became more symmetric, forming an interpenetrating
network. As a result, a balanced charge transport was obtained (μh/μe = 3.53). Balancing the charge mobility
between the hole and the electron is an effective way to reduce bimolecular
recombination, which also agrees well with the remarkable increase
in FF. We also analyze VOC as a function
of light intensity, as shown in Figure S7. It is obvious that the slope for the device with CN (1.59kT/q) is smaller than that of the device
without CN (1.87kT/q), suggesting
that the optimized morphology could effectively reduce the interfacial
trap-assisted recombination and accordingly result in enhanced device
performance.49

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated that balancing the crystal size between the
donor and the acceptor is a crucial premise for fabricating the interpenetrating
network in the S-TR:ITIC blend system. The crystal size of S-TR was
decreased and that of ITIC was increased, which should be attributed
to the optimized solution state and film-forming kinetics. The nucleation
barrier of S-TR in a solution was increased and the disturbance of
S-TR on the self-organization of ITIC during the film-forming process
was reduced. The regulated crystal size can effectively promote the
formation of the interpenetrating network, which facilitated the exciton
dissociation and suppressed the bimolecular recombination, resulting
in an improved PCE. Additionally, three criteria for processing additive
for reducing the gap of crystal size between the donor and the acceptor
have been identified: (i) additive has a higher solubility for the
donor and the acceptor than the main solvent; (ii) additive should
have selective solubility for the component with weak crystallinity;
(iii) the volatilization rate of the additive should be slower than
that of the main solvent. Our work demonstrated the precondition for
fabricating the interpenetrating network in AS-NFSCs and provided
the approach for regulating the crystal size by using additive strategy.

Experimental
Section
Materials
BDTT-S-TR (S-TR) and ITIC were purchased
from Solarmer Materials Inc. Anhydrous solvents chlorobenzene (CB)
and chloronaphthalene (CN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All
of the chemicals were used without further treatment.

PSCs Fabrication
Organic solar cells were fabricated
in the following configuration: indium tin oxide (ITO)/S-TR:ITIC/MoO3/Al. We used UV–ozone to treat the cleaned ITO glass
substrates for 25 min and then spin-coated ZnO layer on the top of
the ITO glass. Subsequently, the ZnO layer was dried at 200 °C
for 60 min. The S-TR:ITIC solution containing different contents of
CN with a total concentration of 12 mg mL–1 was
spin-cast on top of the ZnO layer and the thickness of the active
layer was about 140 nm (the solution temperature was 100 °C).
Finally, MoO3 (10 nm) layer and Al (100 nm) layer were
deposited on top of the active layer in turn by thermal evaporation
in a vacuum of 4 × 10–4 Pa. Finally, four solar
cells were fabricated per ITO glass substrate, each with an active
area of 7.2 mm2.

Characterization
The absorption
of the sample was recorded
by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (AvaLight-Hal) with a halogen
lamp source. The fluorescence spectra of the pure and the blend films
were recorded by spectrometer (Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer with
a 380 nm solid state laser excitation light source). The in situ fluorescence
spectra were recorded using a homemade instrument, which contained
a spin-coater (WE!NVIEW) and a spectrometer (Ocean USB2000+).

The morphology of the S-TR:ITIC film was characterized by using atomic
force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
The AFM was employed to study the surface topography of the films.
The images were recorded by the combined use of SPI3800N AFM (Seiko
Instruments Inc., Japan) with a Si tip (the spring constant is 3 N
m–1). In our work, the AFM was performed in the
tapping mode. The TEM experiments were performed by using a TEM-1011
(JEOL Co., Japan), and the accelerating voltage is 100 kV.

The
phase purity was analyzed by a RSoXS transmission measurement,
which was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the advanced light source
(ALS). The films for RSoXS measurement were prepared on a PSS-modified
Si substrate, and the fabrication process is the same as those used
for device fabrication. Then, the film was transferred by floating
in water to a Si3N4 membrane (Norcada Inc.).
The two-dimensional scattering patterns were recorded on an in-vacuum
CCD camera (Princeton Instrument PI-MTE). The sample detector distance
was calibrated from the diffraction peaks of poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-2-vinyl pyridine), and it had
a known spacing of 391 Å. The beam size at the sample was 100
× 200 μm2.

The crystallinity of the blend
film was analyzed using a grazing
incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), which was performed
at the beamline 7.3.3 advanced light source (ALS; Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory). The films were prepared on a Si substrate, and
the fabrication process is the same as that used for device fabrication.
The 10 keV X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of 0.12–0.16°,
selected to maximize the scattering intensity from the samples. A
photon-counting detector (Dectris Pilatus 2M) was employed to detect
the scattered X-rays, and used silver behenate (AgB) to calibrate.

We use a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source to measure the
current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated
solar simulator, and the irradiation intensity is 100 mW cm–2. We use a lock-in amplifier at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz during
illumination with a monochromatic light from a xenon lamp to measure
the external quantum efficiency (EQE).
