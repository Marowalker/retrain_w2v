Boron-dipyrromethene
(BODIPY) dyes have been extensively investigated
in recent years for a variety of bioanalytical and bioimaging applications.
The success of these applications relies on the stability of BODIPYs,
particularly under acidic conditions. In this work, the stability
of a series of 4,4′-disubstituted BODIPYs (−F, −CN,
−Ph, −Me, −OMe) toward addition of excess trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) was studied systematically and comprehensively through 11B and 1H NMR, UV–vis, fluorescence, thin
layer chromatography, mass spectrometry, and infrared. The results
indicate that 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 is the most
stable among this series and remains unchanged even 3 days after addition
of excess TFA. On the other hand, 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5 are the
least stable, toward addition of TFA, and the 4,4′-diphenyl
and 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPYs 1 and 4 were found to have intermediate stability. The experimental analysis
and comparison with theoretical calculations indicate that the 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 has the greater aromaticity of the series, as evaluated
by the BLA parameter, decreased charge on boron, and upon TFA addition
it forms an unusually stable BODIPY 2···TFA
complex. On the other hand, all other BODIPYs decompose within hours
after TFA addition. Computational modeling demonstrates that 4,4′-dicyano
substitution increases aromaticity and stabilizes the B–N bond,
resulting in the most stable compound from the series studied.

1 Introduction
4,4-Difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene
fluorophores (known as boron dipyrromethenes
or BODIPYs) have many desirable photophysical properties for bioanalytical
and bioimaging applications, including sharp absorption and emission
bands in the visible spectral region, high fluorescence quantum yields,
and high molar extinction coefficients.1,2 Compared to
other commercially available fluorescent dyes (such as cyanines, rhodamines,
and oxazines), BODIPY dyes generally display higher solubility, higher
cell membrane permeability, lower cytotoxicity, and are photochemically
more stable.3 Therefore, BODIPY dyes are
finding multiple applications in biology and medicine, for example,
in molecular imaging, biological labeling, and theragnostic. These
applications often require the covalent attachment of fluorescent
dyes to target groups or affinity ligands, such as peptides, antibodies,
and nanoparticles, under strong acidic or basic conditions, and/or
high temperatures.4 As a result, many commercially
available dyes, including some BODIPYs, are unstable to typical conjugation
procedures and conditions, decomposing during the conjugation or purification
processes, for example, during high-performance liquid chromatography
using even a small percentage of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for elution,
limiting their practical use for these applications. Therefore, we
conducted a comprehensive study on the stability of a series of BODIPY
dyes bearing different substitutions at boron, in the presence of
excess TFA.

Although many BODIPYs functionalized at boron have
been recently
reported, including F-BODIPYs,1,5−9 Cl-BODIPYs,10−13 H-BODIPYs,14 C-BODIPYs,15−20 O-BODIPYs,21−26 OH-BODIPYs,27,28 and CN-BODIPYs,29−32 their stability and reactivity have not yet been comprehensively
investigated. In 2011, Yan et al.33 reported
that a 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY was more stable under both acidic
(using di or trichloroacetic acid) and basic conditions (using ammonium
hydroxide) than the corresponding 4,4′-difluoro, 4,4′-dimethyl,
and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPYs, using 11B NMR. More
recently, Rumyantsev’s group34,35 studied the
kinetic stability of a series of 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPYs in both
aqueous and nonaqueous solutions and found a relationship between
the dissociation rate with the solution acidity and the charge on
nitrogen. We have recently reported36 that
cyano substitution at the boron atom significantly increases BODIPY
stability under acidic conditions, particularly for the 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPYs.
Interestingly, Ortiz’s et al.17 have
demonstrated that 4,4′-dicyano substitution also enhances the
lasing stability of 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPYs in thin films.

Despite the spectacular increase on BODIPY literature in recent
years, studies on BODIPY stabilities in aqueous and organic solutions
have lagged behind, although these are important for further practical
applications of this type of dye, especially the effects of substituents
on boron on BODIPY stability.37 Herein,
we report a comprehensive study on the stability of a series of 4,4′-disubstituted
BODIPYs (Scheme 1)
under strong acidic conditions. We used several experimental methods,
including 11B NMR, 1H NMR, thin layer chromatography
(TLC), UV–vis, fluorescence, mass spectrometry (MS), and infrared
(IR), as well as computational modeling, to gain insights into the
properties of the BODIPYs, aimed at identifying spectral characteristics
and exploring the reasons behind the observed differences in stabilities.
On the basis of existing previous research,3,33−35 we chose 4,4′-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-phenyl-BODIPY 1 as the model compound and examined the effect of disubstitution
at the boron atom, with cyano 2, methyl 3, phenyl 4, and methoxy 5 groups, on the
stability under excess TFA in organic (CHCl3 or CH2Cl2) solutions.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of BODIPYs 1–5
2 Results
and Discussion
The present study focuses on the investigation
of BODIPY stability
upon addition of TFA. All BODIPYs were analyzed in air at room temperature.
If no TFA was added, all BODIPYs from the series studied showed no
decomposition after 3 days in CDCl3 or CH2Cl2 solutions under air.

2.1 NMR Studies
The
stability of BODIPYs 1–5 in CDCl3 solutions upon
addition of 10 equiv of TFA was investigated by 1H NMR
and 11B NMR spectra over a period of 2 days (1H NMR) and 3 days (11B NMR).

2.1.1 11B NMR
The 11B NMR spectra are shown in Figures S1–S5 of the Supporting Information.
Different behaviors were observed
for the different BODIPYs in this series. 4,4′-Difluoro-BODIPY 1 was stable within the first 1 h but the characteristic triplet
peak at 0.69 ppm gradually broadened over time, and additional peaks
were observed upfield after 5 h of TFA addition (Figure S1). In contrast, the characteristic singlet in the 11B NMR spectrum of 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 observed at −16.87 ppm, slightly shifts to −16.60
ppm upon addition of TFA and remains unchanged after that for up to
the 3 day period investigated (Figure S2). We believe that this slight change in the chemical shift is due
to the formation of a hydrogen-bonded BODIPY 2···TFA
complex (see below, Sections 2.1.2, 2.3, and 2.6). On the other hand, the 11B NMR spectra for
4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 (Figure S3) and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5 (Figure S5) changed immediately upon addition
of TFA. In both cases, the original singlet peaks at −0.78
and 2.57 ppm for 3 and 5, respectively,
immediately disappeared upon addition of TFA, indicating complete
degradation of these BODIPYs. New peaks were observed in the 11B NMR spectra of 3 and 5 upon addition
of TFA, downfield shifted in the case of 3 and upfield
shifted in the case of 5, indicating the formation of
multiple boron degradation products. For 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4, the characteristic singlet at −0.10 ppm significantly
broadened upon TFA addition, but it was still present after 3 days,
and no noticeable new peaks were observed (Figure S4).

On the basis of the 11B NMR spectra results,
BODIPY 2 is the most stable compound, remaining unchanged
even 3 days after addition of 10 equiv of TFA. 4,4′-Difluoro-BODIPY 1 and 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4 exhibit intermediate
stability, with some of the compound appearing to remain in the solution
3 days after addition of TFA, whereas 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5 are the
least stable, decomposing immediately upon addition of TFA. This is
in general agreement with previous stability studies of a series of
4-bora-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-2,6-diethyl-8-methyl-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacenes with 4,4′-difluoro,
4,4′-diphenyl, 4,4′-dimethyl, and 4,4′-dimethoxy
substitution.33 The 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY
remained stable for 3 days upon addition of 50 equiv of dichloroacetic
acid, whereas the 4,4′-difluoro analog partially decomposed
after 1 day and the 4,4′-dimethyl analog completely decomposed
over 6 h. In the presence of 10 equiv of dichloroacetic acid, the
4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY decomposed over a period of 12 h, giving
the corresponding 4,4′-diacetate product. These BODIPYs completely
decomposed within 4 h when TFA was used. Interestingly, the authors
of this paper reported that the 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY was more
stable than the corresponding 4,4′-difluoro compound under
the acidic conditions. In the case of TFA, the 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY
decomposed within 3 h, whereas the 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY remained
stable for 4 h.33

To further understand
the observed NMR spectra and trends, the 11B NMR chemical
shifts of all studied BODIPYs were calculated
in chloroform using the density functional theory (DFT) method at
the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level (Table 1). In agreement with previous results,36 cyano substitution results in a significant shift to negative
δ values, which can be explained by the significant decrease
in the charge on the boron atom, qB (Table 1). A similar tendency
can be observed for all other BODIPYs: the smaller the charge on the
B atom, the greater the upfield shift. The agreement between calculated
and observed values is good, within 0.5 ppm for most BODIPYs, with
the exception of 3 and 5, where the calculated
shift differs from the experimental value by 1–1.5 ppm. Furthermore,
the calculated 11B chemical shifts for the 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2···TFA complexes bearing one or two TFA molecules
hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen atoms of the CN groups are −17.95
and −17.14 ppm, respectively. These results indicate that upon
addition of TFA to BODIPY 2, such complexes could form,
as observed experimentally with a slight downfield shift in the boron
chemical shift (Figure S2). These complexes
are further discussed below in Sections 2.1.2, 2.3, and 2.6.

To gain insight about potential degradation
products being formed
upon addition of TFA in the case of BODIPYs 1, 3, 4, and 5, the 11B
NMR chemical shifts of a series of possible intermediates and products
of the reaction of BODIPYs with TFA were calculated (Table S1, Supporting Information). Compounds of the type BX3 (trivalent boron) and BX4 (tetravalent boron)
were chosen with the intent to cover a wide variety of possibilities.
No peaks that could correspond to a trivalent boron compound were
observed in the experimental spectra with the only exception of 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3, where a downfield peak around 55 ppm was observed (Figure S3, Supporting Information), indicating
a possible BMe2(O2CCF3) product.
On the other hand, multiple tetravalent compounds could explain the
observed NMR spectra. For example, the tetravalent products that could
be formed from addition of TFA to BODIPY 1, e.g., [BF2(O2CCF3)2]−, [BF(O2CCF3)3]−, [B(O2CCF3)4]−, BODIPY-F-O2CCF3, and BODIPY-(O2CCF3)2, all show peaks between −1 and
1 ppm, thus fitting the experimental results, 3 days after the addition
of TFA. Because addition of TFA causes broadening of the peaks, several
boron-containing products likely exist in the NMR solutions of BODIPYs 1, 3, 4, and 5.

2.1.2 1H NMR
The 1H NMR spectra are
shown in Figures S6–S20 of the Supporting
Information. In the case of 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1, the characteristic singlets corresponding to the 1,7- and
3,5-methyl groups and the 2,6-hydrogen atoms changed 1 h after addition
of TFA. This is consistent with the 11B spectra data suggesting
stability of BODIPY 1 over a period of about 1 h. On
the other hand, the 1H NMR data confirmed the stability
of 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 with all characteristic
peaks remaining singlets for up to 2 days and no changes in the chemical
shifts. In the case of 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3,
4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4, and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5 all characteristic peaks disappeared immediately upon addition
of 10 equiv of TFA, indicating the lower stability of these three
BODIPYs relative to 1 and 2. These results
are consistent with the conclusions drawn from the 11B
spectra with the exception of the 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4, which appears to be less stable than suggested by the 11B NMR results, as a result of the observed broadening of
the 11B NMR signal.

Interestingly, for all investigated
compounds, a new peak appears at around 10 ppm for BODIPYs 1, 2, and 5 and around 11 ppm for BODIPYs 3 and 4. This peak also appears in the spectrum
of BODIPY 2, which otherwise remains unchanged. Analysis
of computer-simulated 1H NMR spectra of different possible
compounds suggests that these peaks could be due to several possible
species, including TFA (ca. 10 ppm), TFA dimer (calculated chemical
shift of 13.8 ppm), and to a complex between protonated dipyrromethene
(DPMH+) and TFA anion (calculated chemical shift of 13.0
ppm). The 1H NMR spectra of TFA at 0.3, 0.7, 1.7, and 3.3
M concentrations in CDCl3 were also obtained experimentally
and are shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S21.

In the case of BODIPY 2, the observed
peak at ca.
11 pm is most likely due to a hydrogen-bonded complex between 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 and TFA, as also observed in the 11B NMR spectrum
(Table S2, Supporting Information). The
calculated chemical shift for such a complex between 2 and one molecule of TFA is 12.1 ppm, whereas a complex of 2 with two molecules of TFA has a calculated chemical shift
of 11.9 ppm. The energetics of formation of such complexes is analyzed
in Sections 2.3 and 2.6 of this paper. An analogous complex between
4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1 and one TFA (calculated
shift of 11.3 ppm) might be responsible for the observed peak for
this compound. However, our calculations indicate that the hydrogen-bonded
complexes for BODIPYs 4 (6.69 ppm) and 5 (16.7 ppm) do not generate peaks in this region. Therefore, because
BODIPYs 3–5 decompose rapidly upon addition of
TFA, the observed new downfield peaks for these compounds are likely
due to the complex between protonated dipyrromethene (DPMH+) and TFA anion.

2.2 TLC
TLC analysis
on silica gel plates
was performed using dichloromethane/hexane 1:1 for elution, 3 days
after the addition of TFA, following the 11B NMR experiments.
A schematic representation of the results obtained is depicted in Figure S22 of the Supporting Information. For
4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1, several spots were observed,
most of higher polarity than the starting compound. One of the spots
had the same Rf value (Rf = 0.71) as 1, and a co-spot with starting
material indicated that it was starting BODIPY 1. These
results indicate that 1 partially decomposes in the presence
of TFA, producing several products. On the other hand, the TLC plate
for 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 showed only one single
spot with the same Rf value as the original
BODIPY 2 (Rf = 0.11), indicating
that this compound remained stable 3 days after addition of TFA, in
agreement with the NMR results. In contrast, for 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5, no starting
BODIPY was observed by TLC, indicating complete decomposition of the
original compounds, into more polar products in the case of 3 and less polar products in the case of 5. For
4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4 several spots were observed
by TLC, one of them with the same Rf value
as the starting BODIPY (Rf = 0.84), indicating
that some of 4 still remains 3 days after addition of
TFA. These results are in agreement with the NMR data, also suggesting
the unusually high stability of BODIPY 2. 4,4′-Difluoro-BODIPY 1 and 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4 demonstrate
intermediate stability, whereas 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5 are the
least stable of the series studied.

2.3 Absorption
and Emission Studies
Fluorescence
emission spectra (Figures S23–S27, Supporting Information) and normalized UV–vis absorption
spectra (Figures S28–S32, Supporting
Information) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained 3 days after the
addition of 10 equiv of TFA. Excess amount of triethylamine was added
to the samples to neutralize the excess TFA, and the neutralized spectra
were also obtained. The 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 is
the only compound, for which no obvious changes were observed in both
the absorption and emission spectra. Only a slight decrease in emission
intensity was observed, maybe as result of the formation of a BODIPY 2···TFA complex (see below and Section 2.6), as suggested by the NMR
experiments. In contrast, all other BODIPYs from the studied series
showed pronounced fluorescence quenching and significant broadening
of the main absorption band, along with slight change of the maximum
absorption and emission wavelengths. Furthermore, a distinct absorption
wavelength shift from ca. 500 to 450 nm was observed in the UV–vis
spectra of 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5 upon neutralization with excess amount of triethylamine,
indicating the formation of dipyrromethene (DPM). For 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1 and 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4, no such
wavelength change was apparent. The characteristic BODIPY shoulder
peak at 475 nm suggests that some 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1 and 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4 remained
unchanged, in agreement with the TLC results and NMR results.

The slight decrease in the fluorescence of 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 might be due to formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex between
this compound and TFA. The existence of such complex was also suggested
in the NMR sections above. To analyze this complex, we performed time-dependent
(TD) M06-2X/6-31+G(d, p) calculations of BODIPY 2 and
BODIPY 2···TFA. The results demonstrate
that [BODIPY 2···TFA] is fluorescent with
maximum absorption and emission wavelengths very similar to BODIPY 2 (431 vs 432 nm for absorption and 470 vs 472 for emission).
The oscillator strengths are also similar but these parameters alone
are not enough to predict the experimental quantum yields, which could
depend on different de-excitation paths. The formation of this complex
could explain the observed fluorescence even 3 days after the addition
of TFA to BODIPY 2. As mentioned in the NMR section,
this could also explain the slight shift in the 11B NMR
spectrum for BODIPY 2 as well as the downfield peak observed
in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 upon addition
of TFA.

The calculated forms and energies of the frontier molecular
orbitals
of the studied BODIPYs are given in Figure S33, Supporting Information. As can be expected and in agreement with
previous studies, substitution at the boron atom does not significantly
change the character and the energies of the orbitals.36 The most pronounced difference is observed for
cyano substitution: it stabilizes both the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital by about
0.3–0.4 eV when compared to 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1. The lower HOMO level obtained for BODIPY 2 also suggests higher stability of this compound toward oxidation.

2.4 Mass Spectrometry Studies
High-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) (electrospray ionisation time-of-flight (ESI-TOF))
analysis was performed 3 days after the addition of 10 equiv of TFA
to the series of BODIPY compounds (Figures S34–S38, Supporting Information). The peaks corresponding to [M+H]+, [M+Na]+, and [M+K]+ for 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2, were clearly identified in the mass spectrum of this compound.
This result further confirms the high stability of BODIPY 2 under these conditions. For 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1, the [M+Na]+ peak was also identified, indicating that
some of this BODIPY remains. However, for the 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3, 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4, and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5, no molecular ion peak was observed. In these cases, only
the peak corresponding to dipyrromethene (DPM) was found, suggesting
that these compounds are unstable under TFA and/or the mass analysis
conditions. These results are in agreement with the NMR, TLC, UV–vis,
and fluorescence data above. It is possible that in the case of 4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4, any remaining BODIPY decomposes during the mass analysis.
Similarly, BODIPY-(OCOCF3)2, which is suggested
by previous studies to be a product of the reaction between BODIPYs
and TFA,33,34 was not identified from mass spectrometry
analysis; it is possible that this compound decomposes during mass
analysis as well.

2.5 Infrared (IR) Studies
The transmittance
IR spectra were taken before and immediately after the addition of
2 equiv of TFA to 10 mM BODIPY solutions in dichloromethane (Figures S39–S44, Supporting Information).
The lower amount of TFA was chosen to reduce the rate of the reaction.
For 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5, the fingerprint region changed dramatically, indicating
that both compounds were unstable under these conditions, in agreement
with the NMR data. As discussed in Section 2.1.1, these dramatic changes could be due
to several possible species, including a complex between protonated
dipyrromethene and TFA anion or TFA dimer. Upon addition of TFA to
4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4, a new sharp peak around
1700 cm–1 appeared, which might be due to the formation
of a complex or byproduct, as mentioned above. Nevertheless, the fingerprint
area changed only slightly and good overlap was observed with the
IR spectrum of the starting BODIPY 4. In the case of
4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1 and 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2, there was good overlap of the entire fingerprint region
with the original IR spectra. According to the IR results, 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5 are unstable
immediately upon addition of 2 equiv of TFA. The other three compounds
remain stable, especially 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1 and 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2, in agreement with
the NMR results.

2.6 Computational Insights
on Stability Trends
On the basis of 1H NMR, MS,
and UV–vis studies,
we identified dipyrromethene (DPM) as a product of BODIPY decomposition
reactions in the presence of excess TFA. Therefore, we investigated
several parameters that evaluate the strength of the B–N bond.
Independently of the mechanisms of decomposition of BODIPYs, the conversion
of BODIPY to DPM must involve breaking of the B–N bond. The
simplest measure of the strength of this bond is its length (rB–N in Table 2). As can be seen, with the exception of
4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5, the bond length is in
good agreement with the trend of the observed stabilities under TFA:
the shorter the B–N bond, the higher the stability. This is
in agreement with Groves et al.,11 who
used the B–N bond length to explain different stabilities in
4,4′-difluoro-, diethyl-, and dimethoxy-BODIPYs. Their calculations
showed that the dimethoxy-BODIPY had the longest B–N bond length
of the three compounds, whereas the difluoro had the shortest. Although
their BODIPYs are different from our series, we observe similar behavior,
with the difluoro-BODIPY 1 displaying a shorter bond
length than the dimethoxy-BODIPY 5. These authors also
used the frequency of the symmetric B–N stretching and the
ionicity of the B–N bond (calculated as the difference between
the B and N atomic charges) to explain the observed stability. Our
results are shown in Table 2. Although there does not seem to be a good correlation with
the observed stability trend of the entire series, both of these parameters
clearly indicate that the most stable B–N bond is the one in
4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2.

a ΔEB–N is
calculated at CISD/aug-cc-pVDZ level in vacuum. All other parameters
are calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level in chloroform.

To get more insight into the strength
of the B–N bond, we
calculated the energy necessary to elongate this bond by 0.2 Å.
The value of 0.2 Å was chosen arbitrarily, so it would not be
too large but enough to demonstrate the differences in the bond strength.
The data are presented in Table 2. The dicyano substitution results in slight strengthening
of the B–N bond compared with the 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1, whereas methyl, phenyl, and methoxy substitutions destabilize
the bond. With the exception of 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5, this trend does not contradict the observed stabilities;
however, CN results in higher stability compared to F.

The reason
for the greatest stability of the B–N bond in
4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 might be better explained
with the greatest aromaticity of the BODIPY core in this compound.
The fact that 4,4′-dicyano substitution leads to smaller bond-length
alternation (BLA) parameters and greater aromaticity was first noticed
by Ortiz et al.17 In their paper, the authors
used this parameter to explain the enhanced fluorescence and photostability
of 4,4′-dicyano-substituted BODIPYs. In the present study,
BLA demonstrates that 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 has
the greatest aromaticity among the entire series studied. Thus, its
B–N bond is predicted to be the strongest. The BLA values are
small but they are comparable and in agreement with Ortiz et al.17 The observed trend in BLA fits with experimentally
observed stabilities, again, with the exception of 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5.

In addition, the observed BODIPY stability correlates
with the
mesomeric effect of the substituents on boron: electron-withdrawing
substituents on boron that decrease its charge lead to higher stability
BODIPYs compared with electron-donating substituents. Comparison with
the Hammett substituent mesomeric constants (M)38 (Table 2) shows a correlation with the observed differences in stabilities.
The strong electron-withdrawing CN group decreases the charge on boron
leading to the most stable BODIPY, whereas the most electron-donating
group OMe increases the boron charge and leads to the least stable
BODIPY.

In their study, Rumyantsev et al.34,35 proposed a
mechanism for the reaction of a series of 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPYs
in the presence of different acids (TFA, TClA, HCl, and H2SO4). It was suggested that the reaction begins with an
attack of the acidic proton on the F atom and the formation of a hydrogen-bonded
complex [BODIPY···HA] followed by dissociation to form
[BODIPY···H]+ cation and A– (fast stage). In the second stage of the reaction (slow stage),
the B–N bond of the cation is broken to produce DPM and BF2+. Finally, protonated DPM forms a [DPMH+···A–] complex (fast stage). Our
findings above are in agreement with Rumyantsev’s second step
of the reaction. The B–N bond of 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 is the most stable among the studied BODIPYs making it the
hardest to break.

The proposed first step of Rumyantsev’s
mechanism is in
agreement with our analysis of possible hydrogen-bonded complexes
between the BODIPYs and TFA. As discussed above, our NMR and fluorescence
data for 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 indicate the formation
of a [4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2···TFA]
hydrogen-bonded complex immediately after the addition of TFA. Indeed,
the formation of this hydrogen-bonded complex is energetically favorable
(ΔG = −3.71), as can be seen from Table 2, where the Gibbs-free
energy for the hydrogen-bond formation is calculated for BODIPYs 1, 2, and 5. Furthermore, we also
calculated the Gibbs-free energy for the formation of a possible BODIPY 2···(TFA)2 complex, with each TFA
hydrogen bound to the nitrogen atom of the CN group on the tetrahedral
boron. The formation of such complex is not as favorable (ΔG = +10.84), and although the difference in energy is not
large, the diTFA complex is less likely to be present, mostly due
to the decrease of entropy.

On another hand, the effect of hydrogen
bonding on the B–N
bond length is very interesting. The B–N bond lengths decrease
by about 0.02 Å in all three compounds suggesting higher stability
toward TFA addition. The HOMO level is also stabilized upon hydrogen
bonding. This is especially pronounced for −F and −CN
substitutions, where HOMO is lowered by around 0.3 eV. These two effects
might explain the observed higher stabilities of 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 and 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1 compared
with the other three BODIPYs on this series and also suggest higher
stability toward oxidation.

In summary, on the basis of the
presented calculated data and the
observed 11B and 1H NMR, MS, IR, UV–vis,
and fluorescence spectra and TLC data, we believe that different BODIPYs
most likely undergo different mechanisms of decomposition. For some
of them, the mechanism might be the one described by Rumyantsev at
al.34,35 For the other compounds, other mechanisms
might predominate. Most importantly, for 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2, the reaction likely stops with the formation of an unusually
stable hydrogen-bonded complex with one molecule of TFA. These results
could assist in the design and synthesis of BODIPYs that are stable
under acidic solutions.

3 Conclusions
The
stability of a series of 4,4′-disubstituted 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-phenyl-BODIPYs
(−F, −CN, −Ph, −Me, and −OMe) toward
addition of excess TFA, under air at room temperature, was studied
systematically using several experimental techniques (11B NMR, 1H NMR, MS, IR, TLC, UV–vis, and fluorescence)
and computational modeling. In the absence of TFA, all BODIPYs in
the series studied showed no decomposition after 3 days in CDCl3 or CH2Cl2 solutions under air. However,
upon addition of excess TFA, all experimental methods (11B and 1H NMR, MS, IR, TLC, UV–vis, and fluorescence)
indicated that 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 is the most
stable compound, forming an unusually stable complex with TFA that
remains unchanged for at least 3 days after addition of TFA. Several
experimental techniques, including NMR, TLC, and IR, point toward
the conclusion that 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPY 1 and
4,4′-diphenyl-BODIPY 4 exhibit intermediate stability,
with some of the compounds remaining in the solution 3 days after
addition of TFA. All methods also show that 4,4′-dimethyl-BODIPY 3 and 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5 are the
least stable toward addition of TFA. Furthermore, mass spectrometry
and UV–vis indicate that one product of decomposition of BODIPYs
is dipyrromethene.

Comparison with the theoretically predicted 11B NMR
and 1H NMR shifts of different potential intermediates
and products indicates that several possibilities exist. BODIPY-(OCOCF3)2, which is suggested by previous studies to be
a product of the reaction between 4,4′-difluoro-BODIPYs and
TFA,33 is a potential intermediate, whereas
boronium cations and BR2TFA do not appear to be formed
by NMR.

The performed analysis and the comparison with theoretical
calculations
suggest that different BODIPYs from the series studied most likely
follow different mechanisms of deboronation, especially 4,4′-dimethoxy-BODIPY 5. However, independently from the mechanism, the reaction
involves breaking of the B–N bond to form DPM. Our results
show that 4,4′-dicyano substitution stabilizes this bond, resulting
in the most stable compound from the series studied. This is demonstrated
by the B–N bond length, by the energy necessary to elongate
the B–N bond, and by the bond-length alternation (BLA) parameter.
BLA clearly indicates that 4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 is the most aromatic among the studied compounds possessing the
highest B–N bond order. It is concluded that the strong electron-withdrawing
substituent on boron (−CN) leads to higher stability under
the strong acidic conditions compared to electron-donating substituents.
Our data suggest that the most stable BODIPY 2 likely
exists in the form of a hydrogen-bonded complex of unusual high stability
after the addition of TFA.

The performed experimental and computational
studies show that
4,4′-dicyano-BODIPY 2 is highly stable in TFA
solution. This characteristic of this fluorescent dye is very important
for its future applications, especially for its covalent attachment
to peptides, antibodies, and other molecules for bioanalytic and bioimaging
purposes.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Instrumentation
All of the chemical
reagents were purchased from VWR or Sigma-Aldrich and used without
further purification. The reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography
(TLC) using precoated silica gel plates (0.2 mm, polyester backed,
60 Å) and UV lamp. Column chromatography with silica gel (60
Å, 230–400 mesh) and preparative TLC plates (60 Å,
20 × 20 cm2, 210–270 μm) were used for
the purifications. NMR spectra were collected using a Bruker AV-400
or AV-500 spectrometer at 300 K (operating at 400 or 500 MHz for 1H, 125 MHz for 13C NMR, and 128 MHz for 11B NMR) in CDCl3 (7.26 ppm, 1H and 77.0 ppm, 13C) and BF3·OEt2 was set as reference
(0.00 ppm) for 11B NMR. Mass spectra were collected at
the LSU Department of Chemistry Mass Spectrometry Facility using QSTAR
XL ESI-TOF. The IR spectra were collected using a Bruker α spectrometer.
All samples were scanned as dried ground samples by evaporating the
solvents. BODIPYs 1,22−242,22,23,31 and 5(22,23,31) were prepared as previously reported
in the literature.

4.2 Computational Methods
The geometries
of all compounds and complexes were optimized without symmetry constraints
using the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level.39−41 The stationary points
on the potential energy surface were confirmed with frequency calculations.
The bond elongation energies were studied at the CISD/aug-cc-pVDZ
level.42 The NMR chemical shifts were calculated
at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level using the gauge-independent atomic
orbital method.43−47 This method is suggested for effective but reliable NMR results.48,49 Our previous work on NMR spectra of BODIPYs has also demonstrated
the reliability of this method.36 The atomic
charges were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level using the NPA
scheme.50−52 The absorption and emission spectra for BODIPY 2 and its hydrogen-bonded complex [BODIPY 2···TFA]
were calculated using the TD-DFT method53 and the M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) level,54 as
recommended by Jacquemin at al.55,56 The solvent effects
were taken into account using the polarized continuum model.57,58 The bond dissociation energies were calculated in vacuum. The optimized
geometries, NMR shifts, NPA charges, and IR spectra were calculated
in chloroform. The absorption and emission spectra of BODIPY 2 and [BODIPY 2···TFA] were calculated
in THF. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program
package.59

4.5 Stability
Study of BODIPY Analogs in the Presence
of Excess TFA
Ten equivalents of TFA (1 M in deuterated chloroform)
were added to each BODIPY solution at a concentration of 30–80
mM, prepared by dissolving 5–13 mg (0.014–0.032 mmol)
in deuterated chloroform (0.4 mL) in an NMR tube. After TFA addition,
the NMR tube was shook to mix the reagents. 1H NMR and 11B NMR spectra were obtained at time intervals up to 2 and
3 days. After 3 days, the samples were also analyzed by MS (ESI-TOF),
TLC, UV–vis, and fluorescence spectrometry. The IR spectra
were obtained on 10 mM solutions of BODIPYs 1–5 in dichloromethane, immediately after addition of 2 equiv of TFA
(100 mM in dichloromethane).
