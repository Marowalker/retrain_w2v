We have designed a flexible electrochemical
transducer film based
on PEDOT–titania–poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PTS) for the
simultaneous detection of neurotransmitters. PTS films were characterized
using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy,
scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, four probe
electrical conductivity, ac-impedance, and thermomechanical stability.
The electrocatalytic behavior of the flexible PTS film toward the
oxidation of neurotransmitters was investigated using cyclic voltammetry
and differential pulse voltammetry. The fabricated transducer measured
a limit of detection of 100 nm ± 5 with a response time of 15
s and a sensitivity of 63 μA mM–1 cm–2. The fabricated transducer film demonstrated for the simultaneous
determination of epinephrine, dopamine, ascorbic acid, and uric acid
with no interference between the analyte molecules. Further, transducer
performance is validated by performing with real samples. The results
suggested that the fabricated flexible PTS transducer with superior
electrocatalytic activity, stability, and low response time can be
explored for the sensing of neurotransmitters and hence can be exploited
at in vitro and in vivo conditions for the early detection of the
various diseases.

Introduction
Design and development
of flexible, stretchable, and biocompatible
electrochemical sensor platforms in rolled-up forms are receiving
overwhelming importance for the live monitoring of the transitory
release of biomarkers by living tissues/cells which can be applied
for futuristic medical diagnostics.1−3 The advancement of real-time
and selective detection of various analytes faces many challenges
using conventional analytical techniques such as fluorescence, chromatography
which remains limited because of their high cost, tedious operation,
dependence on the pretreatment of extraction or derivatization, and
postprocessing steps leading to additional costs to the entire process.4,5 In this respect, electrochemical sensors are widely recognized for
its simple instrumentation, simple analysis of the data, accurate
reproducibility, and specificity for various chemically and biologically
relevant analytes and are exclusively placed to facilitate the miniaturization
of a clinical laboratory.6−9 Transducers endowed with high electrical stability,
sensitive electrochemical performance, and excellent cellular compatibility
are receiving tremendous importance for the assembly of highly efficient,
sustainable, light weight, and flexible electrochemical sensors.10−12 Recent advancements in the field of hybrid conductive polymer nanotechnology
processes have paved a great attention to the development of high-performance
organic electronic devices because of its synergistic properties arising
from the molecular-level mixing of these two components.13,14 In these systems, an intimate contact is established between polymer-inorganic
nanoparticles which may help to increase the interfacial area resulting
in an enhancement in the charge concentration, mobility, and also
the electrical conductivity. In addition, self-organization, ordered
structure, crystallinity, well-defined morphologies, and interactions
between the semiconducting polymer nanoparticle in the nanolevel also
play pivotal role in the properties of these hybrid nanocomposites.15,16 In this respect, hybrid conductive nanocomposite originated from
the hierarchical networks of organic–inorganic nanoparticles
deposited on flexible films having biocompatible features along with
the channels of electron-transfer mediators and electron collectors
is receiving keen research interest.17−19

Nanostructured
conductive polymers gifted with tunable size, shape,
spatial arrangement with large surface area, shortened pathways for
charge/mass/ion transport, and also exhibiting exciting features such
as flexibility, lightweight, and processability are making itself
available for use in various applications.20 There is a wider interest in the use of nanostructured conducting
polymers in the field of electrochemistry for improved performance
of electrochemical detection of various biologically and environmentally
important analytes. Because the recognition element attachment and
target molecules can cause perturbations in the chain conformation
of conducting polymer films, a binding event can be converted to an
electrical signal which can be further amplified for readable measurement.21 Electropolymerization has also been applied
for the modification and detection of various analytes because it
can enhance the selectivity, sensitivity, homogeneity, strong adherence
to the electrode surface, and excellent chemical stability.22,23 Among the range of nanostructured conducting polymers such as polyaniline,
polypyrrole, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT has been
a viable candidate as a functional material for a wide range of applications
because of its tunable structural, optical, and electronic properties
such as side chain functionalization, optical transparency, low band
gap, electrical conductivity, flexibility, ease of preparation, thermal
stability, and also widely known for its bioconjugation.24−26 Our group has developed biotemplate-aided PEDOT nanospindles, which
were used as an electrochemical transducer for the detection of various
analytes. The high current response toward electrocatalytic oxidation
is attributed to the shape of the PEDOT nanospindles which facilitate
the smooth transfer of charge carriers from end to end.27 The literature shows that the development of
hybrid conductive nanocomposite can enhance the electrocatalytic performance
toward various analytes by contributing through shortened electron-transfer
pathways and by enhancing charge concentration and mobilities.28,29

Among the semiconductor metal oxides, nanotitania receives
prime
importance because of its high chemical, thermal, and optical stability,
nontoxicity, low cost, and corrosion resistance.30 In recent times, hierarchical titania nanostructures have
been synthesized and investigated as active materials in various applications.
These structures are proficient enough in contrast to other nanodimensions
by providing enhancement in ions/charge transport through the scattering
effect. Because of their largely owned micron-sized structure which
includes nanoscale primary units, such as nanorods, nanoparticles,
and nanosheets, helps to increase the final properties of the material
in the nanocomposites.31−33 These metal oxides can be easily synthesized and
can present the vision of very low cost and highly performing materials
for device applications. There is currently a significant usage in
the hybrid nanocomposites/films as the electrode materials in electrochemical
transducers for improved performance of electrochemical detection
of various biologically and environmentally relevant analytes. For
instance, metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au etc.), conducting polymers (PEDOT,
PANI, and PPy) and its composites are frequently deposited onto the
conventional electrodes to improve the electrochemical responses by
promoting the electron/ion transport through its highly conductive
nanostructured pathways, as well as facilitate the immobilization
of analyte molecules and other biologically relevant molecules. The
induction of these hybrid systems can potentially enhance the catalytic
property, selectivity, and sensitivity of the electrochemical sensor
device.34−36

Flexible electrochemical devices are of great
interest because
of excellent properties such as lightweight, flexibility, and portability
which even are wearable and implantable and are expected to bring
revolution in the arena of electrochemical sensors.37 There are several polymer candidates such as polyethylene
terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polycarbonate, polystyrene,
polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS), and so forth, reported to be used as
flexible substrates for various applications.38 Among these, PDMS belongs to the group of polymeric organosilicon
compounds that are commonly referred to as silicones and are widely
used in functional devices, medicine, and cosmetics. PDMS offers a
high degree of deformability and conformability on diverse surfaces
with varied textures and geometries, portraying themselves as practically
viable candidates for use as active flexible electrode materials.
Incorporating hybrid nanocomposites onto flexible PDMS substrates
through a simple solution blending process provides opportunities
for many bendable substrates, in particular, as electrodes in sensors.
Advantages of flexible PDMS electrodes including its lightweight,
controllability in thickness, high portability, and resistance to
mechanical impact tension, torsion, and bending are well-suited for
the fabrication of biochip, medical product, and minimally invasive
implantable device applications.39−41 Liu et al., developed
a flexible Au nanotubes/PDMS electrode for the
real-time monitoring of nitric oxide release from mechanically sensitive
human umbilical vein endothelial cells.42 However, sensitivity and mechanical stability of the developed sensor
was not much efficient in detecting very weak signals from cells triggered
by stretch strains. In another report, same group overcame the problem
by relying on a hierarchical percolation network of carbon nanotube
and Au nanotubes, which prevailed over important constraints. Its
hybrid structure enabled the performance of the sensor with excellent
and reproducible properties for real-time monitoring of very weak
transient chemical signals.43

Epinephrine
commonly known as adrenaline is present in the central
nervous systems and belongs to the family of neurotransmitters. It
has been estimated that the physiological concentration of epinephrine
in human adult is 10 ng/L.44a,44b It was discovered
in the year 1901 and later developed by Stolz and Dalkin in 1904.
The main function of epinephrine (EP) is to act as a messenger in
scheming the routine functions of the nervous system and its inadequacy
can lead to an altercation of the blood pressure level, heart beats
and will deplete the regular metabolic activities in the human body.
It is also widely recognized as a type of hormone, which is responsible
for a cycle of events in the nervous system and the occurrence is
universally called as “fight or flight” response. Hence
its determination is important for diagnosis of various diseases and
mental disorders and is been used as a pharmaceutical drug to treat
these disorders.45−47 Therefore, it is highly recommended and is of great
significance for the perceptible quantification of EP at physiological
pH in human body fluids. Our group has actively involved in the transducer
performance of various neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin
using electrochemically prepared PANI and PEDOT with metal nanoclusters
such as Au, Ag, and so on, using modified commercial glassy carbon
electrode.48,49 In the present work, we have
fabricated flexible transducer for sensing neurotransmitters based
on conducting polymer nanocomposite for the first time.

There
are several reports based on electrodes modified with conducting
polymer and its composites for the determination of EP. A report by
Hong Zhou et al., discussed about
the molecularly imprinted polypyrrole-modified glassy carbon electrodes
(GCE) for the electrochemical sensing of EP. Here, they have measured
a linear range detection of EP from 10–3 to 10–7 M.50 In another report
by Tsele et al., an electrode material of MWCNT functionalized with
polyaniline doped with metal oxide nanoparticles of titania and ruthenium
oxide have been developed and modified the gold electrode with their
active material. They have found a linear detection limit in the range
of micromolar concentration.51 Further
Ghanbari et al., developed an electrochemical sensor using a polypyrrole-based
nanocomposite heterostructured electrode modified with glassy carbon
electrode for the sensing of EP. They also found a linear detection
limit in the micromolar range.52 All of
these developed electrodes show good response toward the EP through
modification of conventional electrodes such as Au and GCE.

Even though there are numerous reports available for the transducer
performance of EP. In all of the cases, the developed materials are
modified with conventional electrodes such as glassy carbon, platinum,
gold, indium tin oxide, and fluorine tin oxide electrodes. It is noteworthy
to mention that all of these electrodes are manufactured using highly
sophisticated instrumentation, with precursor materials of very high
cost and the fabrication is seemingly a time-consuming process. Furthermore,
all of these possess the limitations of high rigidity, brittleness,
difficult for large area production, less fatigue resistance, and
damping characteristics, thus possessing some significant shortcomings
for use in flexible electronics. Hence, in this aspect, the developed
flexible electrode meet the requirements to be used as flexible electrode
in this device.

Herein, we report fabrication and property evaluation
PEDOT–titania–PDMS
nanocomposite films and further assessing its electrocatalytic oxidation
of EP. The fabricated flexi electrodes also offered distinct voltammograms
for simultaneous determination of EP with other interfering analytes.

Results
and Discussion
Titania was prepared by one-pot hydrothermal
method from titanium
butoxide using HCl, as shown the Scheme 1a. Here, the rate of hydrolysis of titanium
butoxide was carried out under acidic conditions (pH = 1) for the
formation of well-defined titania nanostructures. The slow hydrolysis
of titanium precursor leads to the formation of titanium(IV) complex
ions and resulting in the formation of hierarchical titania complex.
The residue containing titanium tetra hydroxide was calcined at 450
°C to obtain nanotitania. Particle size and zeta potential of
the titania was measured to be 40–60 nm ± 5 nm and +15
mV, respectively, and the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface
area calculated as 122.7 m2/g by BET method. The prepared
nanotitania exhibited a mixed phase of anatase and rutile, and the
formation of mixed anatase and rutile crystalline phase of titania
was prepared and well-characterized from our group.53,54

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation Illustrating the Preparation of Titania,
PEDOT, PT, and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PTS) Films
Nanospindles of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
was prepared by
a liquid crystalline biotemplate approach as reported earlier from
our group.27 Here, we are using 3-pentadecylphenol-4-sulfonic
acid (PDPSA) as biosurfactant. 3-PDPSA forms an adduct with the monomer
EDOT by an acid–base reaction which can easily form columnar
liquid crystalline phase. Formation of liquid crystalline phase was
confirmed by polarized light microscopy. PEDOT–PDPSA was prepared
by oxidative chemical polymerization of EDOT using ammonium persulfate
as an oxidative initiator at ice cold conditions (Scheme 1b). This liquid crystalline
phase can form self-template during the polymerization. Interestingly,
we have observed that the formed polymer (PEDOT) mimics ordering of
the mother template in the nanometer regime. Formation of nanospindles
was further confirmed by microscopic analysis [scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy
(AFM)] and are discussed more in detail in the morphology part.

PEDOT–titania (PT) hybrid nanocomposites were prepared by
the same procedure as the preparation of PEDOT. However, the polymerization
of liquid crystalline template of EDOT–PDPSA was conducted
in the dispersion of titania (Scheme 1b). The structure of PEDOT, titania, and the interaction
between the PEDOT and titania was confirmed by FTIR spectra.

The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of titania,
PEDOT, and PT3 nanocomposites are shown in Figure S1a–c. The structural FTIR spectral bands of titania
at 400–700 cm–1 are related to the Ti–O
and Ti–O–Ti stretching modes which confirms the formation
titania nanoparticles and are shown in Figure S1a. Figure S1b shows the FTIR spectra
of PEDOT showing the bands at 1518, 1483, and 1339 cm–1 which are ascribed to the stretching modes of C=C and C–C
in the thiophene ring, respectively. Further, the vibration modes
of the C–S bond in the thiophene ring were established from
the bands at 978, 842, and 691 cm–1. The stretching
modes of the ethylenedioxy group and ethylenedioxy ring deformation
mode were confirmed from the spectral bands at 1213, 1093, and 920
cm–1 correspondingly. The doping of the PEDOT is
confirmed from the band at 1622 cm–1. The formation
of PEDOT was confirmed from the vanishing of the 890 cm–1 band which is related to the C–H bending mode of EDOT monomer.
The bands at about 1200, 1145, and 1085 cm–1 are
assigned to the stretching modes of C–O–C bonds in the
ethylenedioxy groups, and the band around 920 cm–1 is due to the ethylenedioxy ring deformation mode. The stretching
of the quinoidal structure in the thiophene ring was confirmed from
the vibration bands at 1514 and 1332 cm–1 which
are ascribed to the stretching modes of C=C and C–C
in the thiophene rings, respectively. It can be observed from the
FTIR spectra (Figure S1c) that PT3 showed
a shift in the characteristic bands of titania and PEDOT suggest its
various interactions established between titania and PEDOT in the
PT nanocomposite. Hence, the structural observations made from FTIR
imply the effective interface between the PEDOT and titania existing
in PT nanocomposites, and the results are strengthened by the observation
made by other researchers.55

The
photophysical properties of the TiO2, PEDOT, PT3,
and PTS3 were studied by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy
in ethanol and are shown in Figure S2a–d. Titania nanoparticles showed absorption maximum at 330 nm, and
the UV–visible spectra of PEDOT exhibited bands at 380 nm because
of π–π* and PTs exhibited a broad strong absorption
band at 800–900 nm which is attributed to the polaron−π*
transition. This indicates that PEDOT is in a bipolaronic state as
well as the formation of a sufficient number of charge carriers in
the nanocomposites. The UV–visible spectra of hybrid composites
PT3 and the PTS3 film showed the π–π* band as well
as the onset of the free carrier tail is shifted to higher wavelengths
at 826 nm, revealing the presence of the metallic state. PT3 and PTS3
exhibiting free carrier tail with a polaron band revealed the presence
of a high density of charge carriers because of PEDOT and titania
interactions. This is further supported during the measurement of
electrical conductivity.

TEM, SEM, and AFM microscopic analyses
were carried out for getting
an insight in to the morphology of the prepared titania, PEDOT, PT3,
and PTS3. TEM images of titania exhibited dandelion flowerlike hierarchical
structures, consisting of large number of tiny titania nanorods protruding
from the center with an average diameter of 10–15 nm (Figure 1a and inset). The
presence of anatase and rutile was confirmed by the presence of fringes
in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) pattern
(Figure 1b), which
showed a lattice spacing of 0.32 nm corresponding to the rutile phase
of (110) plane and 0.35 nm which corresponds to the anatase phase
of (101) plane, suggesting the nanorod growth direction along the
[001].56 The corresponding selected area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is shown in the inset of Figure 1b confirming the
crystalline nature of the hierarchical titania, which supports the
fast electron transport for enhancing the better electrocatalytic
properties.

Figure 1 TEM (a,b), SEM (c), and AFM (d) images of titania; SAED pattern
is shown in the inset of (b); TEM (e) and AFM (f) images of PEDOT,
SEM (g), AFM (h), and TEM (i,j) images of PT3 nanocomposite; and inset
of (j) SAED pattern of PT3. SEM (k) and 3D AFM (l) images of PTS3
inset of (l) shows the height profile of PTS3 film.

The SEM picture of the same is given in Figure 1c. AFM images of
the same (Figure 1d)
also confirmed the formation
of hierarchical titania architectures. The TEM pictures of PEDOT exhibited
nanospindles of 20–40 nm width and 100–200 nm lengths
(Figure 1e). SEM images
of PEDOT showing the formation of nanospindles are shown in Figure S3. AFM of PEDOT (Figure 1f) further supports the observations made
from SEM and TEM. Furthermore, SEM analyses of PT3 showed the formation
of self-assembled PEDOT nanospindles on titania nanorods to form hierarchical
nanosheet-like features (Figure 1g). The TEM images of the PT3 nanocomposite confirm
the self-assembly process of hierarchical nanosheets coupled with
PEDOT nanospindles (Figure 1i). HRTEM and SAED pattern of the PT3 nanocomposite confirm
the preservation of crystalline phase of titania in PT3 nanocomposite
(Figure 1j and inset).
The self-assembled structures of PT3 were further confirmed from AFM
analysis (Figure 1h).
The height profile of the PT3 nanocomposite showed an average height
of 6 ± 3 nm upon drop-casting on cleaned mica (inset of Figure 1h).

The surface
morphology of films is a very important factor for
device applications because a nonuniformity on the surface can cause
crash or curb with the upper layers and can cause serious problems
on the performance of the devices. The surface morphology of PTS3
film (PT3 nanocomposite blended with PDMS) was studied through SEM
and AFM analyses. SEM image of the PTS3 composite film showed particles
that are dispersed uniformly within the matrix which substantiate
the excellent contact of the particles within the films (Figure 1k). AFM was also
used to characterize the surface and also to estimate the grain size
and surface roughness and are shown in Figure 1l. The surfaces of the thin films were observed
as smooth, and the root mean square surface roughness of the films
was observed to be 5–10 nm for PTS3 film with an average thickness
of 1 mm. It is important to note the particles are at uniform height
(4 ± 2 nm, Figure 1l and inset). This PTS3-based film was further demonstrated for their
electrochemical applications.

The crystalline phase and composition
of titania, PEDOT, hybrid
PT3 nanocomposite, and PTS3 film were studied using X-ray diffraction
and are shown in Figure 2a–d, respectively. The prepared hierarchical titania nanostructures
(Figure 2a) exhibited
mixed phase of anatase (A) and rutile (R). The diffraction peaks at
around 25°, 27°, 35.8°, 38.8°, 42.8°, 44.3°,
48.4°, 53.9°, and 57.8° corresponds to the diffraction
peak of A(101), R(110), R(101), A(004), R(200), R(111), R(210), R(211),
and R(220) planes of titania, respectively, confirming the mixed anatase-rutile
form and are well-crystallized (JCPDS files # 21-1272, JCPDS no. #
21-1276). The mass fraction of anatase/rutile phase of nanotitania
was calculated from the relative X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) diffraction
intensities corresponding to the A(101) and R(110) peaks. XRD measurement
revealed that 70% of rutile and 30% of anatase phase of titania were
present in the prepared titania sample. The average crystallite size
of ∼30–50 nm was estimated from the full width at half
maximum using the Scherrer equation.54 The
as-prepared PT3 nanocomposites retained its highly crystalline nature
in the nanocomposite form (Figure 2b). The PTS3 film too exhibited crystalline nature
with less intense peak (Figure 2c). Figure 2d shows the XRD profile of PEDOT, which showed peaks at 2θ
= 6.2°, 12.2°, and 18.2°, and a broad peak at around
25.5° (d = 3.5 Å) which is attributed to
the crystalline nature of PEDOT with highly ordered π–π
interaction in the PEDOT chains.

Figure 2 XRD profiles of (a) TiO2, (b)
PT3, (c) PTS3 film, and
(d) PEDOT.

XRD results suggests the molecular
arrangement or interchain stacking
of PEDOT chains in the hybrid nanocomposite (PT3) which became more
ordered, and also the reduced interchain hopping distance resulting
in efficient charge transport, which can be attributed to the measured
hike in the electrical conductivity of the PT3 and PTS3 films, which
is discussed in the electrical conductivity section.

The electrical
conductivity of the as-prepared nanocomposites (PT)
and films (PTS) was measured using four-probe conductivity meter.
Electrical conductivity of PT nanocomposites studied with increasing
concentration of titania in PEDOT is shown in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information. It was observed that
by the incorporation of increasing amount of titania from 1, 2.5,
5, and 7.5 (wt %) within the PEDOT matrix, electrical conductivity
increased gradually from 40.9, 42.1, 78.1, and 54.3 S/cm, respectively,
and it was also observed that at a particular composition (PT3), the
electrical conductivity was observed to be maximum (78.1 S/cm) beyond
which the conductivity reduced, which can be because of the agglomeration
of titania in the matrix. Electrical conductivity variation of PTS
films with varying amount of PT in the PDMS matrix is shown in Figure S5. Maximum conductivity was measured
for PTS3 flexible film with a conductivity of 1.421 S/cm. Hence, PTS3-based
flexible films were used as the electrode material in transducer for
the evaluation of electrocatalytic oxidation of epinephrine. The enhancement
in the conductivity can be attributed to the well-dispersed PT particles
within the polymeric network. Beyond the percolation concentration,
particles tend to aggregate which is the reason for reduced conductivity.
The surface resistivity measurement is one of the key properties of
films for many device applications. The surface resistivity of PTS3
was measured in the range 2.48 × 108 Ω/sq. The
excellent electrical conductivity and low surface resistivity PTS3
film suggest its application toward as-conductive electrodes in device
applications.57

Figure S6 shows the electrical I–V characteristics of PDMS and
PTS films measured at room temperature using Keithley high resistivity
electrometer 6517B. Because of the comparatively insulating/amorphous
nature of PDMS, the film exhibits only a low conductivity(3 mS/cm).
By incorporating PT3 in the PDMS matrix, the electrical conductivity
increased significantly. The surface resistivity of the PTS films
are measured primarily in the parallel direction with respect to the
electrodes, and the I–V characteristics
are symmetrical and near-linear and PTS3 film exhibiting highest conductivity
(1.421 S/cm). The PTS3 film exhibited highest conductivity compared
to the other nanocomposite films which is mainly because of the well-dispersed-ordered
percolated structure in the PDMS matrix. Thus, the presence of highly
ordered hierarchical self-assembled PEDOT and titania structures of
PT3 in PDMS is expected to enhance the charge-transfer process through
its smooth nanostructured pathways.

Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy is a steady-state technique
to probe the electron transfer and the mechanism of the charge conduction
process at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Electrochemical impedance
measurements were carried out in a mixture of 5 mMK3[Fe(CN)6], 5 mM K4[Fe(CN)6] in 0.1 M KCl at
a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz at a particular open-circuit
potential. Nyquist plot of the PT and PTS electrodes at a particular
open-circuit potential is shown in Figure 3A,B. The plot of PT nanocomposites (Figure 3A(a–d)) was
almost vertical, with phase angles close to ∼90° in the
low-frequency region (inset of Figure 3A). This suggested that the PT electrodes displayed
a diffusion-controlled Warburg capacitive behavior. The absence of
a semicircular feature in the plot indicated that the electrochemical
behavior was not affected by charge-transfer limitations.58 The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the PT1, PT2, PT3, and PT4 electrodes was measured
as 45, 32, 9, and 19 Ω, respectively, which can significantly
enhance the ion-transfer kinetics at the electrode surface and expected
to improve its electrochemical performance. The Nyquist plot of the
flexible PTS1-, PTS2-, and PTS3-based films are shown in Figure 3B. The semicircle
observed in the high-frequency region of flexible films suggested
that there is high resistance compared to PT nanocomposites which
is arising from the insulative nature of PDMS, and thus there will
be small amount of charge-transfer hindrance between the electrode
and the current collector. PTS1, PTS3, and PTS4 exhibited an Rct of 120, 65, and 95 Ω, respectively.
The comparable electron-transfer conductance of PTS films compared
to that of conventional electrodes shows the high conductivity of
the flexible electrode, and this response is attributed to the good
contact produced during the electrode preparation and suggests its
applicability toward its usage as electrodes in various devices.

The equivalent circuit
of the plot containing the solution resistance
(RS), capacitance (Cdl), the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and Warburg impedance (W) is shown in
the inset of Figure 3B shows which symbolizes the efficient distribution of the charged
species arising from PEDOT and titania interface in the PTS3 film
to the interphase which results in the high electronic conductivity
of the film.

Mechanical stability of the prepared PTS films
was measured using
universal testing machine (Instron 3345) as per ASTM D 412 and ASTM
D624-86, respectively. Two specimens from each film were tested according
to the standard testing method (Figure S7a–d). The tensile strength of the film increased from 2.15, 6.5, 12.5,
and 16.18 ± 1.26 MPa for virgin PDMS, titania–PDMS (TP),
PEDOT–PDMS (PP), and PTS3, respectively, which represents the
good compatibility, reinforcement, and interfacial interaction between
the PDMS and PT, PP, and TP which may be responsible for the improved
strength of the composites blends than that of the PDMS film.

Thermal stability of titania, PEDOT, PT3, PDMS, and PTS3 films
were studies using thermogravimetric analysis and are shown in Figure S8a,b. The TG profile of titania (Figure S8a) exhibited almost stable profile.
PEDOT exhibited a three-step decomposition starting at 150 °C
because of the removal of moisture and volatile matter followed by
second-stage degradation at 330 °C which is attributed to the
loss of small fragments from sulfonate-anchored PEDOT and almost total
degradation at 450–500 °C. PT3 exhibited higher thermal
stability starting at 350 °C, which is due to the removal of
volatile molecules during the scission of the covalent bonding between
titania onto the PEDOT chain. The observed enhancement in the thermal
stability can also be related to a better dispersion of nanoparticles.
It was observed that with the incorporation of titania into the polymer
matrix leads to a less weight loss compared to bare PEDOT (Figure S8b,c). Thermal stability of the PDMS
and PTS3 films is shown in Figure S8d,e. Results suggest that the thermal stability of composite film PTS3
system increased as compared with the PDMS film. The onset degradation
temperature has delayed from 340 to 380 °C for PTS3 film compared
to PDMS, which suggested the higher thermal stability of the PTS3
film. All of these results suggest that the incorporation of PT nanocomposite
has a profound impact on the thermal stability of the PTS film which
is expected to be utilized for various applications in electronic
devices.

The electrochemical behavior of flexible PTS3 film
was studied
by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV response for the one electrode
reduction in 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6 in 1 M KCl with
a scanning rate of 50 mV s–1 is shown in Figure 4a. The PTS3 electrode
exhibited two broad redox peaks at +0.6 and −0.7 V, indicating
the presence of PEDOT and titania in the film. The electrochemical
stability of the modified flexi electrode was studied for 50 successive
scans using CV at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. There
was a minimal decrease in current response of the PTS3 film from the
first cycle compared after 50 cycles. The percentage of the current
drop obtained was less than 5%. Thus, the anodic peak currents remained
almost stable, indicating excellent electrode stability during repeated
CV scans and are not undergoing serious surface fouling.59

rate
50 mV/s, pH 7.4). (b) plot of Ipa vs square
root of the scan rate of PTS3 film.

The effective electroactive surface area of the modified
electrode
was studied by varying the scan rate and thereby analyzing the variation
in the anodic peak current by CV for the one-electrode reduction of
K3[Fe(CN)6] (5 mM in 1 M KCl). Figure 4b shows the peak current versus
square root of the scan rate plots of the PTS3 film electrode. The
plot of the oxidation peak current versus scan rate (ν) showed
a linear relationship, indicating that the oxidation peak current
increased linearly with the increasing scan rate. The anodic peak
current have a linear dependence against the square root of scan rate
with the correlation coefficient of 0.9901. From the plot of peak
current Ip versus the square root of scan
rate, the electroactive surface area was calculated using Randles–Sevcik
equation (eq 1). 1  where Ipa represents
the anodic peak current (A), n is the number of electrons
involved, A is the area of the electrode (cm2), D is the diffusion coefficient, C0 is the concentration of K3Fe(CN)6, and ν is the scan rate. For K3Fe(CN)6, n = 1 and D = 7.6 ×
10–6 cm/s. The effective electroactive surface area
can be calculated from the slope of the plot of Ipa versus ν1/2, and it was found to be
0.298 cm2 for PTS3 film-based flexible electrode. The higher
electroactive surface area of flexible electrode compared to that
of the conventional electrode can provide more efficient active sites
for the oxidation of analyte molecules.49

The PTS3 flexible electrode having highest electrical conductivity
and large electrocatalytic surface area was employed for studying
the electrochemical oxidation of EP. It has been observed that the
CV diagram measured an enhancement in current during the electrocatalytic
oxidation of EP at 0.15 V. The electrocatalytic oxidation of PTS3
toward EP was investigated by measuring the enhancement in anodic
current response in the presence of the analyte kept in the phosphate
buffer solution of pH 7.4. Experiments were performed with EP in the
concentration range of 20–1000 μM (10–6 M concentration) and are shown in Figure 5.

solution in
phosphate buffer solution (scan rate 50 mV/s, pH 7.4).

The comparable oxidation current of 2.5 μA
for PTS3 film
electrode toward the EP oxidation suggests enhanced electrocatalytic
behavior toward oxidation of EP compared with that of conventional
modified electrodes.60 The surface of PTS
is endowed with a large distribution of reduced and oxidized ions
where the reduced form of the film can mediate the electron transfer
for oxidation of analyte molecules.61 The
increase in the oxidation peak current values can be correlated with
the enhanced electrochemical activity of PTS3 toward EP. The hike
in the anodic current can be arising from the strong combination of
the electron-rich oxygen atom of titania and the presence of conjugated
π–π and reducible cation radicals present in PEDOT
film. Studies were also performed toward the oxidation of EP as a
function of scan rate effect (range 0.01–0.1 V s–1) at a constant concentration of EP (10–6 M) with
PTS3 film electrode and are shown in Figure 6a. The plots of peak current versus square
root of scan rate showed a linear relationship. The hike in the oxidation
peak current with the increasing scan rate and the suggested diffusion-controlled
process are shown in Figure 6b.

Figure 6 Cyclic voltammograms of (a) PTS5 film electrode at scan rate (range
10–100 mV/s) in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution containing
1 mL of 10–6 M of EP. (b) Plot of peak current vs
square root of scan rate plots of PTS5 film electrode, and (c) plot
of Ep was plotted against log ν
(phosphate buffer pH = 7.4).

The surface coverage (Γ) of EP on the surface of the
PTS3
electrode was calculated from the slope of the plot of peak current
(Ip) versus the square root of scan rate
using Laviron equation  where Ip is the
peak current in A, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant (9.65 × 104 C
mol–1), ν is the scan rate in V s–1, A is the area of the electrode in cm2, Γ is the surface coverage of the analyte (mol cm–2), R is the ideal gas constant (8.3144621 J K–1 mol–1), and T is
the temperature in K. Assuming that n ≈ 1,
the calculated surface coverage of EP on PTS3 film electrode was found
to be 1.167 × 10–9 mol cm–2, which is consistent with Mphuthi et al.59 and suggesting the formation of self-assembled monolayer of PT3
nanocomposite on the surface of PTS3 electrode, which provides the
efficient catalytic sites toward the oxidation of EP. On the basis
of the values of EP surface coverage observed, it can be confirmed
that the analyte molecules gets efficiently diffused on the PTS3 film
electrode, where the analyte molecules gets electrocatalytically oxidized.
The Tafel values were also calculated using the equation below, where Ep was plotted against log ν (Figure 6c).  

The measured potential
value for PTS3 electrode for EP was calculated
as 44.2 mV. The low Tafel value specifies the adsorption of the analyte
on the electrode surface caused by the electrode porosity. Tafel slopes
are widely acknowledged as an indication for the efficient electrocatalytic
performance of the electrode surface.62 The enhancement in peak current as the scan rate increases further
suggested that EP was oxidized by the diffusion process. Further,
the Tafel slope used for understanding the mechanistic pathway of
the oxidation of EP at the electrode surface using equation Below,
where the Tafel slope is defined by the transfer coefficient αa  

Assuming the rate-determining
step of the redox reaction in EP
involves a one-electron process (n = 1), a value
of 0.44 is obtained for the charge-transfer coefficient (α).
In PTS3, the percolated nanostructures along with low Tafel slope
indicates that the fabricated electrode have superior electrocatalytic
activity toward the EP. These results suggested that the PTS3 electrode
system enhances the adherence and the activity of the electrode surface
by providing a well-defined mass transport regime.

Further electrocatalytic
performance of the transducer PTS3 toward
detection of EP was studied using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV)
which is an effective and rapid electroanalytical technique that is
extensively utilized because of its minimization of background effects
and can therefore typically result in higher sensitivity in detecting
the analyte molecules. The electrocatalytic oxidation of EP was investigated
and is shown in (Figure 7a). Studies were carried out with varying concentrations of EP. Electrocatalytic
oxidation occurred at 0.15 V with a satisfactory linearity over a
range of concentrations from the range of 20–1000 μM
in phosphate-buffered solution of pH 7.4, and the calibration plots
of current versus concentration obtained are shown in Figure 7b. Results suggested that the
oxidation current peaks are directly proportional to the increase
in concentration of EP. The hike in the oxidation peak current with
increasing scan rate and further confirms the diffusion-controlled
process. The detection limit was calculated based on the relationship
LOD = 3.3 δ/m, where δ is the relative standard deviation
of the intercept of the y-coordinates from the line
of best fit, and m the slope of the same line. The
detection limit of 100 nM ± 5 was obtained for EP at PTS3 electrode.
The measurements with the flexible electrodes were repeated 5 times
for analyzing the transducer performance. The mechanism of the oxidation
of epinephrine in pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered solution has been be well-explained
by Kim et al. and Dias et al.63,64 The oxidation of epinephrine
to epinephrinechrome at the PTS3 electrode could be considered with
the start of reduction of epinephrinequinone to leucoepinephrinechrome
and then finally to the oxidation of leucoepinephrinechrome to epinephrinechrome.
This observed reaction mechanism (Figure S9) is well in accordance with the literature.61

Figure 7 (a)
DPV profile PTS3 film in presence of epinephrine solution in
phosphate buffer solution and (b) plot of EP concentration vs current
(scan rate 50 mV/s), phosphate buffer pH = 7.4.

There are several other analyte molecules such as ascorbic
acid
(AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA), which are well-known to get
electro-oxidized at potentials nearby the EP oxidation. To show the
selectivity of EP, it is very much essential for the selective detection
of EP in the presence of all of the nearby oxidizing analytes. Henceforth,
DPV was used for the selectivity of the PTS3 film electrode, where
the concentration of EP was increased from 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7,
0.8, and 0.14 mL and the concentration of AA, DA, and UA (0.3 mL,
10–3 M) were kept constant. In Figure 8, the flexible PTS3 electrode
showed separate oxidations peaks of AA (−0.03 V), EP (0.15
V), DA (0.15 V), and UA (0.3 V) with no significant interference between
the analytes, which shows the efficacy of the flexible electrode for
the simultaneous determination of interfering analyte molecules. Because
the oxidation potential peak of both EP and DA lies in the same range,
the potentials were deconvoluted from the area under the electrocatalytic
oxidation profile by fitting the DPV scans using the GRAMS 32 software.
This profile is shown in the inset of Figure 8, which shows well-resolved oxidation peaks
of EP and DA.

of AA,
EP, DA, and UA (scan rate 50 mV/s).

The efficient electron-transfer mechanism was further evaluated
by calculating the electrochemical band gap and is shown in Figure S10 and Table S1. The efficient electron transfer process observed with the present
PTS3 electrode system can be explained from the fundamental band alignment.
The mixed phase of titania is the core driving force for enhanced
transport of charge carriers in the composite electrode. In PTS electrode,
upon electrical excitation, the charge carriers will efficiently move
from the LUMO of PEDOT (∼−2.4 eV) which is higher than
that of the conduction band of titania (∼−4.2 eV), and
this will create an energy barrier for the back electron transport.
The effective interaction of the PEDOT chains on the surface of hierarchical
titania can enhance the amount of charge carriers on the surface of
the electrode. PEDOT alone can be considered as neutral soliton (electrochemical
band gap of 2.72 eV), where it possesses less mobility of the electrons
along the polymer backbone. To provide more charge carriers, titania
in the PTS (low electrochemical band gap of 2.23 eV) will provide
a pathway for the π electrons in the form of intermediate bands
similar to soliton band for efficient transport of charges, and they
can become more stable as they can be delocalized over the polymer
chain which leads to the formation of solitons and polarons that facilitates
the electronic conductivity in PTS electrode system.65 The CV and DPV profiles of PTS3 electrode in the absence
of analyte do not show any oxidation peaks corresponding to any particular
analyte (Figure S11). The comparison of
polymer-based electrodes for the determination of EP is given in Table S2.

The analytical performance of
the PTS3-film-modified electrode
was further applied for the determination of pharmaceutical samples
(adrenaline injection) via standard addition method. The samples were
diluted using 0.1 M phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.4) before the
analysis.

Briefly, the adrenaline injection sample was diluted
50 times with
0.1 M phosphate buffer solution and spiked with different concentrations
of epinephrine. The recovery values are summarized in Table 1, which shows that the recoveries
are in the range of 95–100%. These results clearly indicate
that the PTS3 flexi electrode can be employed for the quantification
of adrenaline with appropriate recoveries for practical applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Titanium tetrabutoxide
(Alfa Aesar), ethylenedioxythiophene
(EDOT), epinephrine hydrochloride, dopamine hydrochloride, ascorbic
acid, uric acid, potassium ferricyanide, 3-pentadecylphenol, and potassium
ferrocyanide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Pvt. Ltd.,
India; ammonium persulfate (APS, Merck), potassium dihydrogen phosphate
(Merck), polydimethyl siloxane-PDMS (Dow Corning, Sylgard 184 silicone
elastomer kit), sodium hydroxide, tetrabutyl ammonium hexaflourophosphate
(Merck), acetonitrile (Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd.), isopropyl alcohol (Fischer
Scientific), distilled water, and ethanol. All of the chemicals were
used as received. PDPSA was prepared as reported earlier from our
group.50

Preparation of Titania
(TiO2) Using Hydrothermal
Method
In a typical synthesis process, 0.5 mL (1.4 ×
10–3 M) titanium(IV) butoxide was dissolved in equal
volume of concentrated HCl (11 N) and distilled water (5 mL each)
by magnetic stirring. The clear transparent solution formed was transferred
into an autoclave hydrothermal pressure vessel with a total volume
of 25 mL. The sealed pressure vessel was then kept in a furnace for
3 h at 140 °C. Later, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature.
Then, the product was washed repeatedly with water through centrifugation
and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for overnight and finally
calcined at 450 °C.

Preparation of Polyethylenedioxythiophene–Titania
(PT)
Composite by Oxidative Chemical Polymerization
PDPSA [2 g
(6 × 10–3 mol)] is added to 30:70 ethanol–water
mixture (30 mL of ethanol and 70 mL of water) and stirred the solution
for 20 min at 60 °C. EDOT [2.5 mL (1.75 × 10–2 mol)] was added upon stirring at room temperature using a magnetic
stirrer for 30 min. Titania (0.1 g) (PT1) dispersed in water was added
to the above solution. Then, 5 g (2.19 × 10–2 M) of APS in 25 mL of water was added dropwise to the above solution
for 30 min. Later, the solution was stirred for 24 h in ice cold conditions.
The product was isolated by centrifugation and washed with distilled
water repeatedly and dried in an oven at 50 °C under vacuum for
12 h. Other PT nanocomposites were prepared via similar procedure
by varying the amount of titania from 0.1, to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 g, and
are designated as PT1, PT2, PT3, and PT4, respectively.

Preparation
of PTS Films
In a typical procedure, 2
g of PDMS, 1 g of PT nanocomposites, and 0.2 g of curing agent were
stirred well using a mechanical stirrer in a beaker. Then, the solutions
were casted into a Petri dish and kept at 30 °C for 24 h for
the formation of PTS films. PTS films casted from different PT compositions
are prepared and are designated as PTS1, PTS2, PTS3, and PTS4, respectively.

Characterization Techniques
The surface morphology
of the samples was studied using various microscopic techniques SEM,
TEM, and AFM. Zeiss EVO 18 cryo-SEM with variable pressure working
at 20–30 kV was used for the SEM analysis. HRTEM was performed
in an FEI Tecnai S Twin microscope with an accelerating voltage of
100 kV. For TEM measurements, the sample solutions were dispersed
in the solvent and sonicated well under an ultrasonic vibrator. Then,
the sample solutions were allowed to settle for a while and drop-casted
on the top solution on a Formvar-coated copper grid using micro pipette
and dried at room temperature before observation. AFM images were
obtained under ambient conditions to that of TEM, whereas the samples
were drop-casted onto a microscopic cover glass using a Bruker Multimode
AFM-3COCF (Germany) operating in the tapping mode. FTIR measurements
were made with a fully computerized Nicolet impact 400D FTIR spectrophotometer.
Samples were mixed thoroughly with potassium bromide before they were
compressed into pellets for the measurements. Powder X-ray diffraction
studies were performed with an X-ray diffractometer (Philip’s
X’pert Pro) with Cu Kα radiation (l =
0.154 nm) with the step size and the scan rate of 0.02° and 10°/min,
respectively, by employing an X’celarator detector and a monochromator
at the diffraction beam side. Powder samples/films were used by employing
a standard sample holder. Cyclic and differential pulse voltammetric
(CV, DPV) studies and impedance analysis were carried out using a
CHI6211B electrochemical analyzer, in a three-electrode/one-compartment
electrochemical cell in which the flexible electrode was used as the
working electrode and a platinum wire was used as counter electrode.
All of the potentials were recorded using Ag/AgCl as the reference
electrode and purged with nitrogen gas before all measurements. The
working electrode, PTS3 film of square dimension, was contacted with
a copper wire via a conducting copper tape. The active area of the
working electrode was 0.25 cm2. Electrical conductivity
measurements of the pellets/films (1 mm thickness) were performed
with a standard four-probe conductivity meter using a Keithley 6221
programmable current source and a 2128A nanovoltmeter. Surface resistivity
measurements of the films were made using Keithley electrometer 6517B.
The tensile properties of the films were measured on a universal testing
machine (Instron 3345) as per ASTM D 412 and ASTM D624-86, respectively.
Particle size as well as the zeta potential measurements were carried
out in a Nano ZS Malvern instrument employing a 4 mW He–Ne
laser (I = 632.8 nm) and equipped with a thermostat
sample chamber. The BET surface area measurement technique was performed
using Micrometrics Gemini 2375 Surface Area Analyzer, U.S.A., via
nitrogen (N2) adsorption using the multipoint method after
degassing the nanocrystalline titania powders in flowing N2 at 200 °C for 2 h.

Electrochemical Sensing of Epinephrine
Electrochemical
sensing of analytes was studied using flexi PTS3 as the working electrode
and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and platinum as the counter
electrode by CV and DPV. All of the measurements were carried out
in the physiological pH of the phosphate-buffered solution (pH = 7.4)
at room temperature. The measurements toward the detection of EP were
repeated 5 times for analyzing the transducer performance. Briefly,
the phosphate-buffered solution was prepared by adding 39.5 mL of
0.1 M NaOH to 50 mL of 0.1 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated a flexible electrochemical
transducer based on PEDOT–titania nanocomposite in the PDMS
film and demonstrated its application for the selective sensing of
epinephrine. The enhanced current response of the PTS3 electrode was
attributed to the efficient electron-transfer process between titania
and PEDOT and the synergy between the PEDOT–titania nanocomposites.
The flexible electrode film exhibited high thermomechanical stability
along with excellent electrical conductivity and low ac-impedance.
The electrodes were found to be electrochemically stable, which showed
simultaneous detection of ascorbic acid, dopamine, and uric acid with
excellent sensitivity and response time. The high electrical conductivity,
electrochemical stability, and electrocatalytic property of the fabricated
flexible transducer suggested its application as an electrode for
nanodevices and sensors which can be used in high technological areas.
