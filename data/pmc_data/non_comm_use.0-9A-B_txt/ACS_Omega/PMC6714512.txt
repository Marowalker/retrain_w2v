The
enhancement of red emission of YVO4:Eu3+ nanocrystals
by Li+ codoping has been achieved. The effect
of Li+ codoping on the crystalline properties and the luminescence
of Eu3+ has been thoroughly studied. An increase of the
unit cell volume and crystallinity of the nanocrystals is observed
as the concentration of Li+ codoping increases. The lattice
expansion could be related to occupation of the interstitial sites
by the Li+ ions. The nanocrystals appear to be assemblies
of rodlike nanostructures along with cube-shaped rough nanostructures
of uniform size. The optimum concentration of Li+ codoping
for luminescence enhancement is found to be 5 at. % at which Eu3+ emission is increased by about 2.5 times. The fall in Eu3+ emission after codoping of Li+ (7–15 at.
%) is observed. Is it the increased crystallinity (i.e., the size)
or the lattice expansion that poses a limit to luminescence enhancement?
Annealing at 500 and 850 °C increased the luminescence emission
by threefold and fivefold, respectively. The samples are readily dispersible
in deionized water and incorporated easily in the flexible polymer
film made of polyvinylidene fluoride. The dispersion-in-water shows
bright red luminescence as low as 50 μg/mL. The emission intensity
of the dispersion decreases linearly with concentration with a slope
almost equal to unity. The dispersion and the flexible film do not
show luminescence degradation under the influence of oxidizing H2O2 medium. The oxidant-resistant nature with enhanced
luminescence could serve as a suitable red emitter for lighting and
display applications.

Introduction
Lanthanide-doped inorganic
luminescent materials have been extensively
studied for applications in optoelectronics as well as biomedical
applications including drug delivery and optical and magnetic imaging.1,2 The lanthanide-based inorganic nanoparticles are preferentially
studied over the organic dyes, lanthanide chelates, and quantum dots
because of the fact that the latter exhibited short luminescence lifetime,
poor photostability, intermittent blinking, and potential long-term
toxicity issues.3−5 Further, the inorganic nanoparticles have several
advantages—high chemical and photostability, narrow emission
bandwidths, large Stokes shift, absence of blinking, and long luminescence
lifetime of the Ln3+ ions, which is highly desirable for
sensitivity and bioimaging; the inorganic host provides a steady microenvironment
for the Ln3+ emitters; low cytotoxicity as the host matrix
trapped the Ln3+; and tunability of the Ln3+ emissions by designing the morphology and composition of the host
material.6,7 It is necessary that the Ln3+-doped luminescent nanomaterials be improvised to yield better emission
efficiency, longer lifetime, and excellent photostability. Therefore,
the choice of the material and devising a method to enhance luminescence
outcome is of paramount importance. In this context, yttrium orthovanadate
(YVO4) is an inorganic mixed metal oxide of great significance.
It is a self-activated blue emitting phosphor extremely beneficial
for lanthanide ion-activated luminescent materials which has found
potential applications in cathode ray tubes, solid state lasers, fiber-optics,
H2O2 sensors, upconversion luminescence, bioimaging
as well as red-emitting optical guide for magnetic fluid hyperthermia,
etc.8−15 Further, it has good thermal stability, low susceptibility to moisture,
excellent mechanical, physical and birefringence properties. It possess
high down-conversion efficiency owing to low phonon energy (2.8188
× 10–21 J).16 Trivalent
europium (Eu3+) ions are excellent activators for red light
generation in the YVO4 matrix since there is strong VO43––Eu3+ energy transfer
via exchange interaction which is favored by the overlapping of wave-functions
and the V–O–Eu bond angle of 170°.17−19 There are also reports on methods to enhance the luminescence emission
such as codoping with certain metal (mono-, di- or tri-valent) ions
in appropriate stoichiometry, tuning of synthetic parameters and morphological
variations.20−24 The enhancement is effective when the codopant acts as a sensitizer
or improves the crystallinity of the materials. The codoping of Li+ in the YPO4:Dy3+ system has improved
the crystallinity and emissions of Dy3+ including its near
infrared band at 872 nm.23 The presence
of Ce3+ increased the probability of non-radiative energy
transfer toward the activator in the GdPO4:Tb3+ systems owing to its sensitization effect.20 It was suggested that the
introduction of a small fraction of impurity metal ions into a codopant
lattice induces fast energy transfer from the host to activator ions.
Based on the above facts, it is anticipated that Li+ codoping
in the YVO4:Eu3+ system could, therefore, yield
a potential bright red emitting material for display and lighting
devices as well as bioimaging applications.

In this article,
we report the synthesis of YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ (x = 1–15
at. %) nanocrystals of uniform size by a hydrothermal method using
a water–glycerol (2:1 v/v) mixture as the solvent. YVO4:5Eu3+ refers to 5 at. % Eu3+-doped
YVO4. The use of glycerol can serve as a reaction medium
as well as a capping agent to prevent agglomeration and control the
formation of nanocrystals. Li+ codoping is found to enhance
the luminescence emission. The emissions from 5DJ (J > 0) levels of Eu3+ can be improved significantly after annealing at 500 and 850 °C.
Luminescent YVO4:Eu3+,Li+ nanocrystals
were incorporated into a flexible polymer film. The robustness of
the polymer film and dispersion-in-water toward oxidation is studied
after the particles are dispersed in H2O2 media.
The enhanced emission and resistance to oxidation showed that the
materials can be promising for applications in display devices.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Yttrium oxide (Y2O3, Sigma-Aldrich), europium oxide (Eu2O3, Sigma-Aldrich),
ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, Sigma-Aldrich),
lithium nitrate (LiNO3, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH, Merck), and glycerol (Merck) are used as received for the synthesis
of materials without further purification.

Synthesis of YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ (x = 0–15 at. %) Nanocrystals
The percentage of Eu3+ ion doping is 5 at. % and Li+ doping is 1–15
at. %. The Eu3+ (5 at. %)-doped
YVO4 sample is denoted as YVO4:5Eu3+. In a typical preparation, stoichiometric proportions of Y2O3, Eu2O3, and LiNO3 are
first dissolved in concentrated HNO3 to obtain their nitrates.
Excess acid, if any, is removed by addition of water followed by evaporation
to dryness three or four times. The salts are then dissolved in 40
mL of water–glycerol mixture (2:1 v/v). In another solution,
stoichiometric amounts of NH4VO3 and NaOH are
dissolved in 40 mL of water–glycerol mixture (2:1 v/v). The
molar ratio of NH4VO3/NaOH is 1:5. The two solutions
are mixed and stirred for about an hour. A clear transparent greenish
solution is obtained. This clear solution is transferred to a 100
mL Teflon lined autoclave and placed in a preheated oven at 150 °C
for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature automatically, the products
are collected by centrifugation. The products are washed with water
till the pH of the liquid becomes neutral and finally with acetone.
The products are dried at 40 °C for further analysis. Heat treatment
or annealing of samples is carried out at 500 and 850 °C, subjecting
to heat for 2 h. Further, the samples are heated at 500 °C to
study the effect of annealing treatment. TheYVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ is again annealed at 850 °C.

Preparation
of Flexible Polyvinylidene Fluoride Polymer Films
Containing YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+
About 0.5 g of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is dissolved completely
in the dimethylformamide solution with continuous stirring. After
complete dissolution of the PVDF, 10 mg of the powder sample is added
to the above PVDF solution and the mixture is sonicated for about
30 min to achieve uniform dispersion of the powder. Then, the dispersion
is poured on a cleaned corning glass surface placed on a level surface
and dried at 80 °C. Thus the flexible polymer film is peeled
off slowly from the surface of the glass after drying.

Characterization
X-ray diffractometry is used to identify
the crystal structure and phase purity of the synthesized materials.
The diffraction pattern was recorded from 15 to 75 in 2θ degree
at room temperature using a PANalytical (X’Pert Pro) X-ray
diffractometer with Cu Kα (1.54060 Å) radiation with a
Ni filter. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the nanocomposites
were obtained using Bruker D8 ECO ADVANCE. The average crystallite
sizes for the nanoparticles were calculated from the most intense
diffraction peak (200) using the Scherrer formula D = 0.9λ/β cos θ, where λ is the wavelength
of the incident X-ray, β is the full width at half maximum (fwhm)
in radian, and θ is the diffraction angle. The shape and size
of the nanostructures of the samples were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) carried out using a JEM2100 (JEOL) transmission
electron microscope. For TEM measurements the samples were ground
and dispersed in propan-2-ol. A drop of the dispersed particles was
placed over a carbon coated copper grid and evaporated to dryness
at room temperature. The photoluminescence spectra and decay curves
were recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 FL spectrophotometer equipped
with a 150 W Xe discharge lamp. All the measurements were performed
at room temperature.

Results and Discussion
XRD, TEM and Fourier Transform
Infrared Study
Crystal
structure and phase purity of YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ (x = 0–15 at. %)
nanocrystals have been determined by the XRD method. Figure 1a shows the XRD patterns of
YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ (x = 0, 5, 10 and 15 at. %) nanocrystals. The diffraction
peaks of the samples can be indexed as a pure tetragonal phase (space
group I41/amd and Z = 4) in agreement with the standard JCPDS no. 17-0341.
As shown in Figure 1b, the peak positions of (200) planes are also shifted to a slightly
lower 2θ as the concentration of Li+ codoping is
increased. According to Bragg’s law of diffraction, the position
of the diffraction peak of the diffraction angle is inversely related
to the d-spacing. Therefore, the shift toward the
lower diffraction angle indicates an increase in the d-spacing. The calculated lattice parameters, fwhm (fwhm in 2θ),
crystallite sizes and crystallinity of the 0, 5, 10 and 15 at. % Li+-codoped samples are presented Table 1. The volumes of the unit cell of the nanocrystals
are increased with the increase in the Li+-codoping concentration.
Here, we can obtain valuable information about the crystalline properties
of the nanocrystals. At coordination number 6, the ionic radii of
Y3+, Eu3+, and Li+ are 90.0, 94.7,
and 76.0 pm, respectively.25 The size of
the Li+ ion is smaller than that of the Y3+ ion.
It is expected that the unit cell volume will be decreased when Li+ substitutes the Y3+ sites in these nanocrystals.
But, the actual volume is increased with Li+ substitution.
The sample YVO4:5Eu3+ has a = 7.133 Å, c = 6.285 Å, and V = 319.85 Å3, whereas YVO4:5Eu3+,10Li+ has a = 7.139 Å, c = 6.291 Å, and V = 320.68 Å3. This could suggest that Li+ occupies the interstitial
sites rather than the Y3+ lattice sites similar to that.
in YPO4:Eu3+ as reported by Parchur et al.24,26 In Figure 1c, the
variation of the fwhm and unit cell volumes are presented. The fwhm
values are decreased with increasing Li+ ion codoping.
This is an indication of the increase of crystallinity of the nanocrystals
as the concentration of Li+ is increased. The relative
extent of crystallinity (Xc) can be calculated
by using an empirical relation between Xc and β(hkl), that is, β(hkl) ×  = KA, where
β(hkl) is fwhm (in degrees) of the most intense
peak and KA is a constant (0.24).27 The crystallinity of the Li+-codoped
YVO4:5Eu3+ samples are increased from 0.40 to
3.19 as shown in Table 1 with the increase of Li+ doping. Meanwhile, the calculated
crystallite size obtained for the 0, 5, 10, and 15 at. % Li+-codoped nanocrystals are 27, 38, 46, and 54 nm, respectively. It
is to be noted that the calculated crystallite size (D) may not give a true picture of the size of nanocrystals but it
may apparently suggest the fact. Consequently, the decrease of fwhm
as well as the increase of calculated crystallite size and crystallinity
could have indicated the favorable growth of the particle size as
the concentration of Li+ is increased.

The XRD
patterns of the as-prepared 500 and 850 °C annealed
YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples are shown
in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
It is obvious that the annealing does not affect the tetragonal phase
of YVO4 in these samples. However, the intensity and the
fwhm values of the peaks increase slightly. The increase in intensity
could be due increased crystallinity of the sample on removal of the
organic molecule and OH/H2O adsorbed on the nanoparticles.
The removal of the OH/H2O is also reflected in the corresponding
infrared spectra of the samples. The fwhm values for the as-prepared
500 and 850 °C annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples are 0.23°, 0.26°, and 0.33°, respectively.
There can be two possible reasons for the slight broadening of the
diffraction peaks after annealing: (a) decreased crystallite size,
and (b) increasing lattice strain. The decrease of the crystallite
size is not likely to occur since there is an increase of peak intensities
after annealing. As the crystallinity increases, it is expected that
the sharpness of the peak would also increase. Therefore, the peak
broadening could be ascribed to the increase of the lattice strain
in the nanoparticles as the annealing treatment transformed the morphology
of the nanoparticles due to reduction of the amorphous behavior and
assuming a nearly single crystalline nature.

Figure 2a–c
show the TEM images of YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+. The micrographs have evidently shown that the nanocrystals are
assemblies of rodlike nanostructures. In an effort to lower the strain
energy, the primary rodlike units may coalesce via an oriented attachment
mechanism.28 The rodlike units have lengths
of about 100–150 nm. Some cube-like rough nanostructures of
about 100 nm in dimensions can also be seen. These latter nanostructures
could be formed by reorganization of the elementary amorphous nanostructures
and they therefore appear rough. The inset of Figure 2c shows the selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern. Some of the bright spots in the pattern are indexed
to (200), (220), (112) and (420). The high resolution TEM (HRTEM)
image is shown in Figure 2d. The lattice spacing is found to be 3.56 Å which matches
with the (hkl) = (200) plane of the tetragonal phase
of YVO4.

Figure 2 (a–c) TEM and (d) HRTEM images of YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ nanocrystals. The inset of (c)
shows the
SAED pattern.

The TEM images and the SAED patterns
of the as-prepared YVO4:5Eu3+ sample are shown
in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).
The size of the particles
is about 50–80 nm. They have an irregular geometry and highly
rugged morphology. This rugged appearance could be due to reorganization
of the smaller primary nanoparticle units to form the bigger nanoparticles
of poor crystalline nature on hydrothermal ageing. The SAED patterns
also showed diffused rings of low intensity which indicates the poor
crystallinity of the as-prepared YVO4:Eu3+ nanoparticles.
A comparison of the TEM images for the YVO4:5Eu3+ and YVO:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples revealed that the
size of the nanoparticles increases and the morphology changes with
the addition of Li+ as a codopant. The results shown by
the micrographs are in conformity with the observations ruled out
from XRD analysis. Therefore, the addition of Li+ favors
the growth of the size of nanoparticles.

The TEM, HRTEM, and
SAED pattern of the 850 °C annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples are shown in Figure
S3 (Supporting Information). The sizes
of the nanoparticles are in the range of 100–150 nm. That is,
there is no appreciable change in the sizes of the nanoparticles after
annealing at 850 °C as compared to the as-prepared sample. However,
the morphology of the nanoparticles is drastically changed. The nanoparticles
are no longer a coalescence of rodlike units, as in the case of the
as-prepared sample, but single crystalline nature of the nanoparticles
is observed. From the HRTEM image, the lattice spacing is observed
to be 3.43 Å which corresponds to the (hkl)
= (200) plane. The SAED pattern also consists of intense bright spots
aligned along a line. These observations suggest the enhancement of
crystallinity of the sample after the annealing treatment.

The
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the as-prepared
and annealed (500 and 850 °C) YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples are shown in Figure 3. All the spectra contain two main absorption
bands in the 400–1000 cm–1 region—a
weak one at 451 cm–1 corresponds to the antisymmetric
bending ν4 mode (A2u) originating from
the Y–O vibration and an intense broad band covering 550–1000
cm–1 centered at 781 cm–1 corresponding
to symmetric stretching ν3 (A2u + Eu) originating from the V–O vibration of the VO4 group.29 The other vibrational
bands in the 1000–4000 cm–1 range are assigned
to C–O stretching (1064 cm–1), O–H
bending (1644 cm–1), CH2 deformation
(1359 and 1477 cm–1), and O–H stretching
(3360 cm–1).30,31 In a peculiar manner,
the intensity of the bands due to the O–H groups is diminished
with increasing annealing temperatures. This could be ascribed to
the loss of O–H and H2O adsorbed on the nanoparticles.
However, the bands due to C–O and CH2 groups do
not show any significant decrease in the intensity for 500 °C
annealing. When it is annealed at 850 °C, the C–O and
CH2 bands are also diminished which implies the partial
removal of the solvent (glycerol) from the surface of the nanoparticles.

YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples.

Photoluminescence Study
Figure 4a shows the excitation spectra of the as-prepared,
500 and 850 °C annealed samples of YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ when the emission wavelength is monitored at 618
nm. Here, a strong excitation band is observed broadly in the 230–350
nm regions. The broad excitation band consists of peaks at 275 (shoulder)
and 315 nm which are due to O–V CT transitions. These transitions
arise from the transition of O2– (2p) → V5+ (3d) orbitals in the VO4 unit. According to the
molecular orbital theory, the two peaks of CT transitions in the VO4 group namely at 275 and 320 nm are due to 1A2(1T1) (ground state) → 1E(1T2), 1B1(1E) (excited states) transitions.17 The
low intensity bands in the 360–410 nm region of wavelengths
correspond to f–f transitions of the Eu3+ ion.32Figure 4b shows the emission spectra of the as-prepared YVO4:5Eu3+ sample after excitation at 320 and 395 nm. Compared
to direct excitation at 395 nm, the emission intensity of Eu3+ (618 nm) on excitation at 320 nm is about 4-fold higher. The low
emission intensity on direct excitation is due to the Laporte forbidden
nature of f–f transitions. Emissions from Eu3+ are
displayed, whereas no significant emission from the host can be observed.
This indicates an efficient energy transfer from the host VO43– to Eu3+ ion. Figure 4c shows the emission spectra of the YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ (x = 0–15 at. %) samples after excitation at 320 nm.
The emission intensity of Eu3+ increases upto 5 at. % of
Li+ codoping and then decreases with increasing concentration
of the Li+ ion. Beyond 5 at. % Li+ codoping,
the emission intensities show a decrease. The inset shows the integrated
area intensities of the 618 nm emission when the samples are excited
at 320 nm. It is observed that the integrated area is maximum in 5
at. % Li+ codoping. However, no significant change of peak
positions is observed. The change will be large when the 4f energy
levels of Eu3+ are strongly affected by the crystal field.
It is already established that the Eu3+ ion is highly useful
in probing its site symmetry or crystal environment.32 The intensity ratio I(5D0–7F2)/I(5D0–7F1) is a determining
factor of the Eu3+ site symmetry. In a highly symmetric
environment, the intensity value is close to 1 whereas if Eu3+ is located in a low symmetry site, the ratio approaches 10. In this
work, for excitation at 320 nm, the ratio is in the range of 6.3–5.4
and for direct excitation at 395 nm, the ratio is in the range of
7.1–5.6. The ratio is decreased with increasing Li+ (x = 0–15 at. %) concentration. This implies
that the site symmetry of Eu3+ is lowered on codoping with
the Li+ ion.

of YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ (x = 0–15%) after excitation at (c) 320
nm, and (d)
395 nm. The inset (c) shows the integrated area intensity with Li+ concentration.

The emission spectra
of the YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ after excitation at 395 nm are shown in Figure 4d. Similar to the
320 nm excitation, the maximum emission is observed for the 5 at.
% Li+-codoped sample. Similar to the 320 nm excitation,
the maximum emission is observed for the 5 at. % Li+ codoping.
Here, the increase in the luminescence emission intensity of Eu3+ in YVO4 on Li+ ion codoping may be
attributed to increased crystallinity. The increase in crystallinity
reduces the probability of non-radiative transition that arise from
defects and therefore, the probability of radiative transition is
increased. Such similar characteristics have been reported by Parchur
et al.23 Assuming that the distribution
density of the Eu3+ ion is uniform for the nanocrystals
obtained at different Li+ concentration, there are two
important factors that can be considered—(a) increasing unit
cell volumes and (b) increasing the crystallite size. These two factors
can probably affect the luminescence of Eu3+ as the concentration
of Li+ is increased. First, as the volume of the unit cell
in increased when the Li+ ion will occupy the interstitial
sites, the distance of separation of the adjacent Eu3+ ions
or the VO4–Eu3+ distance will be increased.
At lower concentration of Li+ up to 5 at. %, the separation
factor may be suitable for efficient energy transfer either by overlapping
of wave-functions or by affecting the V–O–Eu bond angle.
But beyond the 5 at. % Li+ codoping concentration, the
increased volume may distort or decrease the extent of overlapping
of wave-function due to increased separation and ultimately reduce
the efficiency VO4 → Eu3+ energy transfer.
And below 5 at. % Li codoping, the Eu3+–Eu3+ separation may be close enough to lose energy by cross relaxations
amongst them. Second, as the crystallite size is increased, more VO4 and Eu3+ will be seated deeper. At this condition,
the Eu3+ ion seated deeper may be less affected by the
excitation of VO4 and the probability of the VO4 → Eu3+ energy transfer may be decreased. These
combined factors may, therefore, be responsible for the sudden decrease
of the integrated area intensity of the Eu3+ emission as
the concentration of Li+ codoping is increased. The second
size factor may be ruled out by the use of a stronger excitation source
such as laser that could reach deeper seated activators or cathodoluminescence
with varying filament current may be helpful.

Figure 5a,b respectively,
shows the excitation and emission spectra of the as-prepared, 500
and 850 °C annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples. The samples are excited at 320 nm. In case of the
as-prepared sample, emission bands are observed at 540, 560, 581,
595, 618, 652, and 705 nm. The bands at 540 and 560 are due to the 5D1 → 7F1 and 5D1 → 7F2 transitions,
respectively. The green emission at 540 nm (5D1 → 7F1) exhibited an appreciably high
intensity. Those emission bands at 581, 595, 618, 652, and 705 nm
correspond to 5D0 → 7F0–4 transitions of the Eu3+ ion.32 The ratio of intensities of red to green (R/G)
emissions is found to be in the range of 17.6–23.31. The highest
R/G ratio is observed in the 5 at. % Li+-codoped YVO4:Eu3+ sample. After annealing at 500 and 850 °C,
the emission intensities of Eu3+ (618 nm) are enhanced,
respectively, by about threefold and fivefold than that of the as-prepared
sample. Further, well resolved emission spectral lines in the 380–520
nm regions can be observed in these annealed samples. These extra
emission bands due to 5D3 → 7FJ (418, 430, and 448 nm), 5D2 → 7FJ (467, 492, and 513 nm) transitions are observed in addition to those
bands observed in the as-prepared samples. The intensities of these
extra bands are also very much enhanced in the 850 °C annealed
sample. The enhancement in the luminescence intensity after annealing
could be the result of increased crystallinity owing to the loss of
quenching molecular species (organic glycerol and H2O molecules)
on the nanoparticle surface as well the particles may tend to achieve
single crystalline nature.

Figure 5 (a) Excitation and (b) emission spectra of the
as-prepared, 500
and 850 °C annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples.

The emission spectra
of the 500 °C annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ samples, after
excitation at 320 nm, are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). Similar to the as-prepared samples,
the emission intensity of Eu3+ increases upto 5 at. % Li+ codoping and then decreases as the Li+ concentration
is increased. The integrated area intensity of the Eu3+ emission at 618 nm is maximum at 5 at. % Li+ codoping.
In case of the as-prepared samples, the values of the integrated areas
for 7, 10, and 15 at. % Li+ codoping falls abruptly. However
in the annealed samples, the integrated area values are sufficiently
high. This suggests that the emission intensities of the 7, 10, and
15 at. % Li+-codoped samples are very much enhanced after
annealing. Despite this, the trend of luminescence enhancement with
Li+ concentration is similar to the as-prepared samples.
The intensity ratio of the 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions lies in the range of 6.2–5.4
for increasing Li+ concentration, which is very similar
to those of the as-prepared samples. For the as-prepared, 500 and
850 °C annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples, the intensity ratios are 5.54, 6.11, and 6.25, respectively.
This could suggest that the site symmetry of Eu3+ is lowered
slightly after annealing.

Decay of the 5D0 Level
of Eu3+
For any luminescent system which follows
the monoexponential
or one lifetime component decay process, it can be expressed as log10I = log10I0 – (t/2.303τ). Figure 6a,b show the plot
of log10I (I = intensity
at time t) versus time (t) for the
YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ (as-prepared, 500
and 850 °C annealed) sample after excitation at 320 and 395 nm,
respectively. The logarithmic plots can be fitted linearly and the
emission pathways follow first order exponential decay. Since for
excitation at 320 nm, the decay of the 5D0 level
of Eu3+ involves energy transfer from the host VO4, the decay profile is fitted using the following non-exponential
equation34 1  Here, b is related to the
energy transfer and diffusion co-efficient. The equation has only
one lifetime component, which is similar to the monoexponential profile. Figure 6c shows the luminescence
decay profile of the 5F0 level of Eu3+ for the as-prepared, 500 and 850 °C annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples after excitation at 320
nm. The emission is monitored at 618 nm. On 320 nm excitation, the
excitation electrons undergo non-exponential decay (i.e., non-radiative
energy transfer from VO4 to Eu3+). Here, the
decay curves are fitted using the non-exponential eq 1 and the lifetimes are listed in Table 2. The lifetime values
of the as-prepared YVO4:5Eu3+ sample after excitation
at 320 and 395 nm are, respectively, 710 and 657 μs. Upon Li+ codoping, the lifetime of the sample is increased. Further
on annealing, the lifetimes of the samples are also increased.

The as-prepared, 500 and 850 °C annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples have a lifetime of 1162, 1376, and
1464 μs, respectively. Some of the reported lifetime values
for the 5D0 level of Eu3+ in YVO4 systems are 460–740 μs.33,35−37 And for direct excitation at 395 nm, the monoexponential
equation: I = I0 e–t/τ is used to fit the decay
profiles shown in Figure 6d and their lifetimes are given in Table 2. The average lifetimes for the as-prepared,
500 and 850 °C annealed samples are, respectively, 951, 1256,
and 1278 μs. This indicates decrease in non-radiative transition
probabilities owing to increased crystallinity on annealing and removal
of defects/quenchers. The lifetimes are longer for excitation at 320
nm compared to the direct excitation at 395 nm. This is due to strong
energy transfer from the host to the activator.

The decay profiles
of the as-prepared YVO4:5Eu3+,xLi+ (x = 0–15
at. %) and 500 °C-annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples for the excitation at 320 and 395 nm are presented,
respectively,2 in Figures S5 and S6 (Supporting Information). Generally, for both
the excitation wavelengths used, the lifetimes of the samples increase
upto 5 at. % Li+ codoping. The lifetimes again decrease
at 7 at. % Li+ codoping and then increase toward 15 at.
% Li+ codoping. Their lifetime values are summarized in Table 2. Here, the lifetime
values exhibit an increasing trend from 7 to 15 at. % Li+ codoping, but their emission intensities exhibit a decreasing trend.
It is to be noted that, in the XRD pattern, the crystallinity increases
as Li+ codoping increases. And the TEM images also revealed
the favorable increase of particle size and enhanced crystallinity
with Li+ codoping. The increased crystallinity can have
positive influence on the efficiency of luminescence emission. The
lifetime values also suggest increased population of the excited in
the Eu3+ in the 7–15 at. % Li+-codoped
samples. But the lifetime values are lower than the 5 at. % Li+-codoped sample. This could be the result of the relative
position of Eu3+ in the nanocrystals with the increase
of the particle size. There is also another possible speculated reason.
The Li+ ion has 1s22s0 configuration,
that is, the 2s orbital is completely vacant. As the Li+ concentration increases, the proximity of Li+ to Eu3+ may increase. The hole in the Li+ ion in close
proximity to Eu3+ or in the Eu3+–Li+ pair may serve as a non-radiative trap to quench the luminescence
of Eu3+ even though the population of the electrons excited
may increase. As a result of these factors, the luminescence intensities
of Eu3+ fall as the concentration of Li+ increases
beyond 5 at. % codoping. The speculative reasoning may require further
experimental studies.

CIE Coordinates, Dispersion-In-Water and
Flexible Polymer Film
Formation
The color tone of the emitted light can be understood
by examining the CIE color coordinates. The CIE coordinates are obtained
by using the CIE color matching function calculator for the color
wavelength data ranging from 400 to 700 nm and the normalizing constant K = 1. The obtained coordinate values are (0.58, 0.29),
(0.59, 0.29), (0.58, 0.30), (0.61, 0.33), (0.60, 0.29), (0.58, 0.29),
and (0.57, 0.30), respectively, for 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at.
% Li+ codoping. Whereas, those of the 500 and 850 °C
annealed are, respectively, (0.59, 0.33) and (0.62, 0.33). The diagram
showing the CIE coordinates of the as-prepared and annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ is shown in Figure 7 (left). It is therefore obvious
that the samples exhibited a red emission.

Figure 7 (Left) CIE coordinates
of the as-prepared (green dot), 500 °C
(blue dot) and 850 °C (black dot) annealed YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ samples. (Right) Emission spectra of the
flexible polymer film (red line) and the dispersion in water (green
line). Inset: Digital photographs of the film and the dispersion.
Here, the film and the dispersion are excited at 320 nm.

In order to examine the possibilities of the samples for
flexible
display devices and bioimaging applications, the luminescence properties
of the PVDF polymer film and dispersion-in-water of the YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ sample are studied. Both the film
and the dispersion are excited at 320 nm to determine their emission
properties. The preparation of the flexible polymer film has been
explained in the Experimental Section. For
dispersion-in-water studies, 0.5–100 μg of the sample
per mL of water is dispersed. Here, a stepwise dilution method is
taken up to lower the concentration of dispersion. The representative
emission spectra of the film and the dispersion-in-water are presented
in Figure 7 (right).
The digital photographs in the insets show the flexible polymer film
and the red luminescence from the dispersion-in-water. As low as upto
0.5 μg dispersion gives a detectable/visible red emission. The
emission spectra of the different concentrations of the dispersion-in-water
are presented in Figure 8. The intensity of emission is observed to decrease linearly with
concentration of nanocrystals. This may suggest that the concentration
quenching effect in nanocrystals is an intrinsic effect dependent
on the concentration of the activator in the nanocrystals but independent
of the concentration of the nanocrystals in such a dispersion system.
In addition, the dispersion-in-water is also subjected to different
concentrations of H2O2 solution. The emission
spectra of the YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ sample
dispersed in H2O2 solution are presented in Figure 9a. Their luminescence
is not affected by the presence of H2O2 which
implies that the material is not chemically disturbed by the oxidizing
media.

dispersion-in-water. The excitation wavelength is 320 nm. (Right)

In the previous literatures, YVO4:Eu3+ and
EuVO4 nanoparticles are reported as potential candidates
for H2O2 sensing.12,37 The sizes
of the particle that have efficient sensing were in the range of 20–40
nm. Some of the other key factors that affect the response toward
the oxidant H2O2 are the defects, morphology,
and crystallinity of the nanoparticle systems. In our case the YVO4:Eu3+,Li+ nanoparticles have an average
size of 200 nm along a dimension and appears to be an assembly of
rodlike structures. The presence of Li+ may have imparted
different defect properties compared to YVO4:Eu3+ and EuVO4. In addition, there is a big difference in
the morphology and crystallinity of the nanoparticles as well as the
presence of organic (glycerol) molecule adsorbed on the surface. Thus,
it is highly possible that the larger size and low defects could be
the reason for less sensitivity of the YVO4:Eu3+,Li+ nanoparticles towards the oxidizing H2O2 media. Further, to study the robustness of the polymer
film under an oxidative environment, it is treated with H2O2 solution and their luminescence is studied. Three films
of (1 cm × 1 cm) are soaked separately in H2O2 solutions of three different concentrations for 1 h. After
this, they were removed and kept at room temperature for a few minutes.
The luminescence properties of the as-prepared film as well as the
H2O2 treated films were measured under excitation
at 320 nm. The emission spectra are presented in Figure 9b. It was observed that the
films are not wetted and their luminescence properties had not been
affected even after exposure to H2O2 media.

Conclusions
Single phase YVO4:Eu3+,Li+ nanocrystals
with an enhanced red emission have been synthesized successfully.
The optimum concentration is found to be 5 at. % for Li+ codoping. Further, annealing of the YVO4:Eu3+,Li+ nanocrystals at 500 and 850 °C enhanced the
crystallinity, luminescence emission, and the lifetime of Eu3+ emission. The heat treatment also improved the luminescence emission
from the 5DJ (J > 0) levels of Eu3+ as well as the lifetime of the 5D0 level of Eu3+, which has been attributed
to increased crystallinity. The lifetimes of the 5D0 level of Eu3+ for YVO4:5Eu3+ and YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ are, respectively,
710 and 1162 μs at 320 nm excitation. However, for direct excitation
at 395 nm, the lifetimes of the 5D0 level of
Eu3+ for the YVO4:5Eu3+ and YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ are 657 and 951 μs,
respectively. The longer lifetime of the sample upon excitation at
320 nm implies an efficient energy transfer from VO43– to Eu3+. The samples are readily dispersible
in deionized water and show bright red luminescence at as low as 50
μg/mL. The decrease of the emission intensity linearly with
the concentration of nanocrystals, may suggest that the concentration
quenching effect in the nanocrystals is an intrinsic effect dependent
on the concentration of the activator in the nanocrystals but independent
of the concentration of the nanocrystals in such a dispersion system.
The nanocrystals can also be readily incorporated into a flexible
polymer film. The red emission from the dispersion-in-water and the
polymer film are strongly resistant to the oxidizing H2O2 media. The resistance to oxidizing H2O2 may also be ascribed to the large size and decreased defects.
Further analysis such as the use of a strong laser excitation source
or cathodoluminescence may provide a clear insight into the luminescence
behavior of the nanocrystals. And the factors affecting the luminescence
such as the crystallite size and the lattice expansion may be clearly
understood. Therefore, YVO4:5Eu3+,5Li+ nanocrystals may be a promising luminescent material with a high
luminescence yield and high chemical stability.
