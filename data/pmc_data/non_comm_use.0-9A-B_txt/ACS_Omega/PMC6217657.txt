The development of
green and biodegradable electrical components
is one of the main fronts of research to overcome the growing ecological
problem related to the issue of electronic waste. At the same time,
such devices are highly desirable in biomedical applications such
as integrated bioelectronics, for which biocompatibility is also required.
Supercapacitors for storage of electrochemical energy, designed only
with biodegradable organic matter would contemplate both aspects,
that is, they would be ecologically harmless after their service lifetime
and would be an important component for applications in biomedical
engineering. By means of atomistic simulations of molecular dynamics,
we propose a supercapacitor whose electrodes are formed exclusively
by self-organizing peptides and whose electrolyte is a green amino
acid ionic liquid. Our results indicate that this supercapacitor has
a high potential for energy storage with superior performance than
conventional supercapacitors. In particular its capacity to store
energy was estimated to be almost 20 times greater than an analogue
one of planar metallic electrodes.

Introduction
The technological state
in which we are immersed has increasingly
required the synergistic use of environmentally friendly materials
and clean energy sources. This is the case, for example, of biotechnological
areas, which require materials that are both ecological and biocompatible.1−6 Another area for which the use of environmentally and/or biocompatible
materials is highly desirable is the area of sustainability and renewable
energies.7−10 In particular, for the specific case of energy storage, the biodegradability
of energy storage systems after their service lifetime would drastically
reduce the risks related to electronic waste.11−13 In addition,
the development of energy storage devices for biointegrated electronics
is necessarily based on biodegradable and nontoxic materials.5,6,14,15 In this direction, research involving natural biopolymers and small
biological molecules has yielded formidable results for the efficient
storage of electrochemical energy with direct applications in biomedical
electronics.7 In parallel, it has recently
been shown that peptide nanostructures exhibit semiconductor characteristics
that enable their use in the development of biocompatible devices
for energy storage.5 Advances in this field
have already been achieved.15,16 For example, it was
observed that the efficiency of supercapacitors with carbon electrodes
modified by peptide nanotubes was increased about 50-fold over the
pure carbon supercapacitor. This was attributed to the expansion of
the specific area of the electrode, where the hydrophilic channels
of the nanotubes allow greater contact with the electrolyte.15,16

Recently, Hamley and collaborators have synthesized and demonstrated
the high stability of bolaamphiphilic polypeptide nanosheets.17,18 Bolaamphiphiles, unlike typical amphiphiles that have a polar head
and a hydrophobic tail, present both hydrophilic ends separated by
a hydrophobic core. This gives these polypeptides very interesting
properties from both structural and energetic points of view. Examples
of this type of system were obtained by the self-organization of the
bolaamphiphilic polypeptides RFL4FR and EFL4FE, which are constituted by a hydrophobic core formed by a leucine
tetrapeptide (L4).17−19 In this sequences, the FR or
FE terminations play an important role; the phenylalanine residue
(F) is inserted to favor the π-interactions between the lateral
chains, whereas the polar residues, arginine (R), and l-glutamic
acid (E) were introduced to promote the interaction of the polypeptide
sequence with the medium. The resulting nanosheets were highly ordered
in the monolayer core, which gives them greater stiffness than those
observed in conventional amphiphilic-based nanostructures.17,18 In addition to the remarkable structural stability, these bolaamphiphilic-based
nanosheets are capable of stabilizing a high surface density of charges
in contact with the medium.17−19 In alkaline solution the termination
of each polar group is −COO and −NH3 so that
the sequences EFL4FE and RFL4FR assume a net
charge of −2e and +2e, respectively
(see Figure 1).

representation of the bolaamphiphilic polypeptides
and their net charge. At left, the ionic pair that constitutes the
supercapacitor electrolyte. At the middle, the computational cell
showing the stabilized structure of the nanosheet (in this case specifically
the EFL4FE) in the ionic liquid [Ch][Gly]. The hydrophobic
core of the nanosheet is represented in gray, the charged groups in
red, and the ionic pairs in white and green. It is possible to observe
a slight permeation of the cations on the negatively charged surface
of the nanosheet. Analogous representation can be obtained for the
RFL4FR system. More details about XFL4FX nanosheets
in [Ch][Gly] ionic liquid are shown in the Supporting Information material.

Considering the high charge densities on the EFL4FE
and RFL4FR nanosheet surfaces, in this study, we propose
to employ such nanosheets as novel electrode materials in electric
double-layer capacitors. These electrodes, formed only by amino acids,
are naturally completely biodegradable. However, in order to obtain
a biologically safe energy storage device, it is desirable that we
make use of a nontoxic electrolyte. For this function, we choose a
cholinium-based ionic liquid that is readily biodegradable and nontoxic.20,21 By associating the cholinium cation with an amino acid anion, we
further guarantee the low toxicity of the resulting liquid, making
it practically harmless. Among the various cholinium-based ionic liquids
recently investigated, we chose the one that employs glycine as the
anion, [Ch][Gly] (see Figure 1), because it presents the best balance of desirable properties:
toxicity, viscosity, and ionic conductivity.20,21 In addition, this liquid is strongly alkaline (pH 10.3 at 5 mM),
a desirable feature here, because we wish to stabilize the protonation
state of the surface polar charged groups of the nanosheets while
maintaining the charge density approximately constant.

Results and Discussion
The supercapacitor proposed here consists of an EFL4FE nanosheet as a positive electrode and a RFL4FR nanosheet
as a negative electrode as shown in Figure 2. Both nanosheets were prepared to have an
approximate area of 17.8 nm2 in the ionic liquid which
corresponds to a surface charge density of 57.6 μC cm–2. This density can be considered high because typical values employed
for electrochemical supercapacitor studies are 1 order of magnitude
lower.22−25 A biophysical system of interest for comparison here are the lipid
membranes, for which a charge unbalance at the interface with the
aqueous electrolytic solutions is observed, of about 0.01 μC
cm–2.26 The separation
between charged surfaces of the nanosheets is about 10.5 nm, whereas
the separation between the neutral surfaces (the outer ones, in contact
with the vacuum) is 17.1 nm. As can be seen in Figure 2, the charge on the electrodes is distributed
in a well-defined plane so that this device can be modeled as a parallel
plate capacitor. Thus, the conventional Poisson equation formalism27,28 used in previous studies to obtain drop potential, specific capacitance,
and energy density can be safely used here.

and positive (blue) electrodes
in red and blue, respectively. [Ch][Gly] ionic liquid is presented
in white and green. The red and blue stripes indicate negatively and
positively charged electrode surfaces, respectively.

The stability of both the EFL4FE and
RFL4FR nanosheets in the ionic liquid [Ch][Gly] was confirmed
by preliminary
simulations, and the results are presented in the Supporting Information. In short, it has been found that the
polypeptides EFL4FE and RFL4FR interact in one
direction by their side chains via hydrophobic contacts, whereas in
the orthogonal direction they interact by a mesh of hydrogen bonds.
In addition, the surface polar groups exposed to the ionic liquid
interact by intense electrostatic forces. This interpeptide network
bonds associated with the interaction with the liquid are the factors
that confer stability to the nanosheets. The stability observed in
[Ch][Gly] is strictly analogous to that occurring in the aqueous environment,19 except that on the surface of the ionic liquid,
there is a strong ionic interaction that leads to the formation of
a double electric layer. It is precisely this feature that makes these
nanosheets attractive and viable for use in energy storage devices.

The malleability of the highly charged surface of the nanosheets
gives the supercapacitor a mass distribution significantly different
from those observed in planar supercapacitors based on flat electrodes
such as graphene, graphite, or gold. Figure 3 shows the mass density profiles for the
charged nanosheets in contact with the ionic liquid. Clearly, it is
possible to observe a higher density of cations at the interface of
the negatively charged electrode (in red), whereas the opposite is
observed for the positively charged electrode (in blue). However,
the most interesting thing to note here is that both electrodes allow
a semipermeation of the ions on their surface, characterized by the
overlap between the density profiles of the nanosheets and the ionic
liquid. This semipermeation is similar to that occurring in porous
electrodes, where a much larger surface area is available for electrode–electrolyte
interaction, greatly favoring the storage properties of the supercapacitor.34−36

density profiles (kg m–3). The mass distributions
related to the nanosheets are in darker colors (negative electrode
in red and positive electrode in blue). The lighter curves refer to
the ion distributions, where light blue and light red refer to the
cation [Ch]+ and the anion [Gly]−, respectively.
At right, van der Waals and Coulomb components of the interaction
energy (kJ mol–1) and the hydrogen bond occurrence
at the electrode–electrolyte interface are shown. In the plots,
the bars refer to the nanosheet–ion interactions, with the
blue bar being associated with the [RFL4FR]/[Gly] interactions,
whereas the red bars to the [EFL4FE]/[Ch] interactions.

The intense interaction between
the electrode and electrolyte can
be described in energetic and structural terms through the analysis
of the formation of hydrogen bonds with the interfaces. Such analysis
is done through the correlation between the pairwise interaction energy
and the hydrogen bond occurrence in the interface electrode–electrolyte.
It is not a thermodynamically rigorous treatment because the pairwise
energies do not consider the entropic contributions for the interaction,
taking into account only the enthalpic part. However, it is possible
to obtain important information about the behavior of the electric
double layer, which is strongly ruled by interactions between the
nanosheet charged surface and their corresponding counterions. In
the bar plots of Figure 3, we observed that, as expected, the electrostatic contribution is
much more relevant for the formation of the electric double layer
than that of the van der Waals contribution. Its magnitude is approximately
an order of magnitude superior, easily observed by comparing the vertical
scales of plots. The blue bars refer to the interaction between the
glycine anion and the [RFL4FR] positively charged electrode, [RFL4FR]/[Gly]. This interaction, of −694 kJ mol–1 (per polypeptide), is significantly larger than its corresponding
[EFL4FE]/[Ch], of −492 kJ mol–1. These values are related to the number of charged sites in each
peptide-ion interagent system and are also consistent with the number
of hydrogen bonds formed at each interface. The total number of electrode/counterion
hydrogen bonds at each interface was 282 and 45 for [RFL4FR]/[Gly] and [EFL4FE]/[Ch], respectively. The strong
interaction at the interface associated with the large number of hydrogen
bonds formed between the electrode and electrolyte are remarkable
features that may be exploited to increase or adjust the capacitance
of the device. The first aspect to be observed is the large difference
between the interactions that occur at both the positive and negative
interfaces. As we will see later, this difference has a strong impact
on the properties of the supercapacitor, conferring it a great asymmetry
and therefore directly affecting its capacitance. Another aspect concerns
the effects of pseudocapacitance, which characterizes electrode materials
that have the electrochemical signature of a capacitive electrode,
that is, exhibiting a linear dependence of the charge stored with
the width of the potential window but where charge storage originates
from different reaction mechanisms, such as redox reactions and charge
transfers. Such effects are related to Faradaic reaction groups containing
oxygen or nitrogen and have been reported as an increase factor of
the total capacitance.34,37 Possibly these effects could
be obtained for the polypeptide electrode supercapacitors through
variations of pH, for example.

The excess charge on the polypeptide
electrodes induces a redistribution
of charges near its surface. This spatial charge density, which is
directly related to the potential through the supercapacitor, is given
at the top of Figure 4. We can observe that the charge density distribution, ρ(z), suffers severe oscillations inside the electrodes (within
the blue and red stripes), which does not occur for typical planar
electrodes (such as graphene, graphite, gold, etc.).22−25,38,39 These oscillations originate from the hydrophilic carbonyl oxygen
and amino hydrogen sites distributed along the polypeptide chain,
which are responsible for the electrostatic interpeptide interactions
in the nanosheet. It is interesting to note that the potential drop
inside the electrodes contributes to the total potential drop across
the supercapacitor.

At bottom, the electrostatic potential (V) through the supercapacitor.
The dashed lines indicate the reference for the calculation of the
electrode potentials (ΔΦ+ and ΔΦ–), in relation to the ionic liquid bulk in the center
of the supercapacitor. The red and blue stripes indicate the position
and thickness of each electrode, negative and positive, respectively.

The electrostatic potential, Φ(z), through
the supercapacitor can be obtained by numerical integration of the
one-dimensional Poisson equation27,28  

Figure 4 presents
the electrostatic potential profile. This potential decreases linearly
outside the limits of the supercapacitor and becomes constant in its
interior near the center region, around 30 nm. In the vicinity of
the electrodes it presents characteristic peaks related to the formation
of the electric double layer. With the exception of the potential
difference observed inside the electrodes, the general behavior of
the potential across the supercapacitor is compatible with that observed
for typical graphene-based supercapacitors. The potential difference
in electrodes (half-cell potential) was determined as the difference
between potentials at the electrode and in the bulk region    

Thus, the potential difference across the supercapacitor
is given
by  

From Figure 4, we
obtain ΔΦ+ = 1.8 V, ΔΦ– = −1.3 V, and ΔΔΦ = 3.1 V. Here, it is
important to note that despite the large surface charge density stabilized
on the polypeptide electrode surfaces, the potential difference across
the supercapacitor presents a typical value, lying within the electrochemical
window of the conventional ionic liquids, that is, less than 6 V.40

The specific capacitance of the electrodes, C+ and C–,
depends on the
surface charge density at the electrode (σ) and the potential
drop from the electrode to bulk. As mentioned before, the surface
charge density is taken as the average total charge on the electrode
divided by its surface area (resulting in 57.6 μC cm–2). Thus, the integral specific capacitance can be calculated as C = σ/Φ.27,28 From this relation,
we obtain that the electrode specific capacitances are C+ = 33.1 μF cm–2 and C– = 43.0 μF cm–2. The total
specific capacitance through the electrode is obtained by  which results in CT = 18.7 μF cm–2.

The observed difference between C+ and C– reflects the inherently asymmetric
nature of this supercapacitor. This asymmetry originates from two
different sources whose effects are strongly coupled and inseparable:
the considerable structural difference of ions [Ch]+ and
[Gly]− and the chemical composition of the electrodes
consisting of two different polypeptides. As we saw before, the anion-positive
electrode interaction is significantly higher (about 40%) than the
cation-negative electrode interaction. The higher interaction of the
ionic liquid with the positive electrode promotes a higher concentration
of charges on its surface, resulting in a greater potential difference
and, therefore, a lower electrode capacitance. This explains the unusual
fact that C– is larger than C+, although the opposite is usually observed.
It is been shown that because of the asymmetry of cation-negative
electrode and anion-positive electrode in flat electrodes/ionic liquid
supercapacitors a larger value occurs for the positive electrode capacitance
rather than the negative one.22−24,38,41

The specific capacitances obtained
for this polypeptide supercapacitor
are relatively high. For example, the electrode capacitance is considerably
higher than those reported for graphene-based supercapacitors with
conventional ionic liquid as the electrolyte. Kim et al. investigated
a graphene supercapacitor using a mixture of [EMIM][BF4]/acetonitrile
as the electrolyte and found that C+ and C– have the values of 3.62 and 3.28 μF
cm–2, respectively, at a potential difference similar
to that employed here, 2 V.25 For total
capacitance, the value found is also higher. The authors found a value
of 2.6 μF cm–2 for the total capacitance using
pure [EMIM][BF4] as the electrolyte.23−25,42 Slightly smaller values (in the range 1.9–2.3) were obtained
when graphene was replaced by graphene oxide.23 Similar results, for a large diversity of graphene-based/ionic liquids
supercapacitors, were found for the total capacitance, all presented
values ranging from 3 to 8 μF cm–2.23,28,36,38,43−51

Higher values for total specific capacitance were obtained
only
when confinement effects were present, as in the case of electrolytes
in the slit or pores52−56 or when morphological variations, such as edge effects and roughness
on the electrode surface, were considered.55,57 In these cases, the specificities of the electrode change dramatically
the electrolyte–electrode interaction because of the change
in ion mobility. Thus, the results found here are consistent with
this fact, that is, the polypeptide electrode surfaces are malleable
and rough and allow a semipermeation of the counter-ions, dramatically
favoring the access of the ions to the charged sites of the electrode
which implies in increasing the capacitance of the device.

In
order to examine the influence of the polypeptide electrode
on the supercapacitor properties, we performed a simulation for a
planar gold electrode supercapacitor using the same electrolyte, [Ch][Gly].
For a physically justified comparison, we use the same total potential
difference found for the polypeptide supercapacitor, 3.1 V. The details
of this simulation are given in the Supporting Information and the results of interest are presented in Figure 5. It is important
to note here that classical simulations of metal surfaces, including
gold, can be tricky depending on what phenomena one wishes to reproduce.58 However in this work, we employ a gold potential
model that is suitable to describe the interaction between the gold
surface and biological systems,59−61 so it is expected that the double
electric layer of amino acid ionic liquid is also well described here.

Figure 5 Planar
supercapacitor with gold electrodes. At top, a molecular
representation of the supercapacitor with the electrolyte [Ch][Gly]
showed in green and white and the electrodes in yellow. The total
charge of the electrode was distributed in the atomic layer in contact
with the liquid. Mass density (kg m–3), charge density
distribution (e nm–3), and the electrostatic potential
profile (V) are showed in this order from top to bottom.

The analysis of the mass density profiles, charge
density distribution,
and electrostatic potential reveals that the flat gold electrode supercapacitor
presents typical behavior and similar properties to the supercapacitors
reported in previous studies.12,22,62,63 For instance, the oscillatory
and out-of-phase behavior of the ion distribution in the electric
double layer can be observed in mass density profiles. Furthermore,
we see that the charge density distributions near to the electrode
surfaces present higher probabilities for the ions with opposite charge
of the electrode and also that the potential at the negative electrode
has a higher magnitude than that at the positive electrode, leading,
as expected, to a higher capacitance of the positive electrode. For
this Au–[Ch][Gly]–Au supercapacitor, the values for
the capacitances C–, C+, and CT were 9.3, 3.8, and
2.7 μF cm–2, respectively. This value for CT is 7 times lower than that obtained for the
polypeptide electrode supercapacitor.

Conclusions
In
this study, we use self-organized charged polypeptide nanosheets
as electrodes to an electric double-layer supercapacitor. This polypeptide
supercapacitor presents some distinct characteristics such as the
semipermeation of ions inside the electrode surface and a greater
capacitance of the negative electrode in relation to the positive
electrode. However more importantly, it presents a total capacitance
that is 7 times greater than its analogue using planar metallic electrodes.
In terms of energy density (u = C(ΔΔΦ)2/2V, where V is the volume of the supercapacitor) the difference in
performance of the two supercapacitors is even greater. The stored
energy density in the polypeptide supercapacitor is 16.7 J cm–3, whereas the gold-based one presents a density of
only 0.9 J cm–3. This impressive result is certainly
a motivating factor for future experimental and computational investigations.
Among the important aspects which have yet to be elucidated is, for
example, the reduction of the alkalinity of the ionic liquid, desirable
to render the device fully biocompatible. However, the variation of
pH by means of the dilution of the ionic liquid can lead to the loss
of efficiency of the supercapacitor. Our preliminary tests, with small
molar fractions of water in the electrolyte, indicate that the effect
of pure water on the electrolyte is drastic with water permeating
inside the nanosheet electrodes, leading to the loss of the double
electric layer structure and a great reduction in the capacitance
(see Supporting Information). Another important
aspect of it is the investigation of the performance of the supercapacitor
considering the asymmetry of the supercapacitor. As the lower capacitance
(C+) dominates the total capacitance (CT), therefore, the development of strategies
to increase C+ is crucial to increase
the capacitance of the supercapacitor.

The device proposed here
presents a high potential for energy storage
using only biodegradable organic matter. It consists of a prototype
for a new class of supercapacitors that can serve as a basis for important
applications in several areas, particularly in the development of
devices for biointegrated electronics.

Computational Details
The study of this supercapacitor was carried out through atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations. Nanosheets and the ionic liquid were
modeled using the CHARMM36-based force field.29 In particular, for the ionic liquid we used a Canongia Lopes–Pádua
refined model.30−32 The cells were equilibrated for 10 ns in NPT ensemble to get a consistent mass density at the bulk
region. In the production stage we have performed a sampling for 50
ns with a 70 nm vacuum slab in the NVT ensemble.
Properties were calculated from simulations considering a time-step
of 2 fs with coordinates collected every 1.0 ps, which gives a total
of 25 000 frames for statistical analysis. All molecular dynamics
simulations have been performed with the GROMACS 2016 program.33 Further details can be found in the Supporting Information.
