ZnSe
microspheres with various Ag and Mn doping levels were prepared
by the hydrothermal method using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Na2SeO3 as precursors and N2H4·H2O as the reducing agent. The
effects of Ag and Mn doping on the phase composition, morphology,
and optical and electrical properties of the final products were systematically
investigated. A remarkable change in morphology from microspheres
with a cubic sphalerite structure to rodlike structure was observed
by Ag doping, while the pristine structure was nearly unchanged via
Mn doping. Moreover, the band gap of ZnSe microspheres could be tunable
in a broad range via controlling the Ag and Mn doping concentration,
and ZnSe with high electrical properties could be obtained by doping
with an appropriate concentration. The first-principle plane-wave
method was carried out to explain the above mentioned experimental
results.

1 Introduction
ZnSe
(Eg = 2.7 eV) is an important
II–VI wideband gap semiconductor. It is widely used in light-emitting
devices, solar cells, and photodetectors because of its high excitation
energy and excellent photoelectric performance.1−4 It is well-known that the microstructure
of the ZnSe governs the photoelectric characteristics of devices.
The optical and electrical properties of semiconductor materials are
the main factors that determine the performance of devices. At present,
it is the most widely used way to regulate the photoelectric characteristics
of semiconductors through morphology regulation or doping treatment.
On the one hand, researchers have conducted extensive investigations
on the controllable synthesis of ZnSe with different structures, such
as nanowires,5−7 hollow spheres,8−11 and microspheres.12−15 On the other hand, the doping
technique by introducing donor impurities or acceptor impurities into
the host lattice is one of the most effective ways to achieve regulatory
effects, and it can accurately control the transport properties of
the semiconductor by adjusting the type of doping element and the
doping concentration. However, the self-compensation effect of II–VI
semiconductors often leads to unipolar conductive behavior, such as
only n-type doping or p-type doping, which is also the main factor
limiting the application of optoelectronic devices. Effective n-type
and p-type doping are required in practical device applications, so
controllable doping of semiconductor materials is particularly important.
Up to now, most studies have mainly doped ZnSe by different types
of elements. For example, ZnCl2 powder was used as the
doping source to realize n-type doping of ZnSe nanowires by means
of thermal evaporation.16 In addition,
p-type ZnSe nanowires were successfully prepared using zinc arsenide
as the doping source.17 However, because
of the self-compensation effect of ZnSe, it produces unipolar conductive
behavior, there are still some problems such as low doping concentration,
poor controllability for ZnSe doping, and the complicated experimental
operation process, which become the main factors limiting the application
of optoelectronic devices.18 In addition,
the mechanism of the change of optical and conductive properties of
ZnSe caused by doping has not been studied deeply in theory. Therefore,
it is of great importance to reach a facile and controllable doping
of ZnSe and understand its underlying doping mechanism. Therefore,
we used a simple two-step hydrothermal method to achieve the doping
of ZnSe by Ag and Mn. At the same time, the effects of different doping
elements on the optical and electrical properties of ZnSe were discussed,
and the first principle was used to compare the photoelectric properties
of ZnSe before and after doping, and gave a certain mechanism explanation.

In this paper, ZnSe microspheres were synthesized by the hydrothermal
method using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and
Na2SeO3 as the precursor and N2H4·H2O as reducing agent.19 The effects of different doping amounts (Ag, Mn) on the
phase composition, morphology, optical and electrical properties of
the final product were investigated. When 10 mL of N2H4·H2O was added, the hydrothermal reaction
was carried out at 180 °C for 4 h, the final products were mainly
ZnSe microspheres of the cubic sphalerite structure; several rodlike
structures occurred in the Ag-doped ZnSe sample, while Mn-doped ZnSe
retained the microsphere structure. Compared with the pure ZnSe sample,
the band gap of Ag:ZnSe showed a red shift as the Ag doping concentration
increases, while the band gap of Mn:ZnSe showed a blue shift with
the increase of Mn doping concentration. Doping with appropriate concentration
can improve the electrical properties of ZnSe. Moreover, the first-principles
plane-wave method was adopted to analyze the energy band structures
of pure ZnSe, Ag:ZnSe, and Mn:ZnSe,20 which
provided an explanation for the intrinsic mechanisms governing the
evolution of the optical and electrical properties of ZnSe via Ag
or Mn doping.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology and X-ray Diffraction
Figure 1 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pure ZnSe, Ag:ZnSe, and
Mn:ZnSe samples. When Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Na2SeO3, and N2H4·H2O are used as the Zn source, Se source, and reducing agent,
respectively. ZnSe synthesized in NaOH medium by hydrothermal reaction
at 180 °C for 4 h exhibits a microsphere-like morphology, as
shown in Figure 1a,b.
However, the morphology of the sample changes after doping with Ag.
When doped with 3.125% Ag, the Ag:ZnSe sample shows a rodlike structure
in addition to a spherical structure (Figure 1c), which may arise from the hydrazine hydrate
with strong reducibility and silver nitrate with strong oxidation.
The reaction of hydrazine hydrate and silver nitrate in the solution
act as an effective source of the Ag element, N2H4·H2O and AgNO3 first react and to form
the Ag element, resulting in a decrease in the content and concentration
of free Ag+ and hydrazine hydrate in the solution. The
appearance of the rodlike structure is attributed to the change in
the content and concentration of reducing agent.21−23 For the Mn:ZnSe
sample, as shown in Figure 1d, ZnSe doped with Mn also shows a spherical shape. Compared
with the morphology of pure ZnSe, the only difference is that the
surface of Mn-doped ZnSe microspheres is much rougher.

SEM images of (a,b) ZnSe microspheres,
(c) 3.125% Ag-doped ZnSe, and (d) 3.125% Mn-doped ZnSe.

As shown in Figure 2, pure ZnSe, Ag:ZnSe, and Mn:ZnSe samples have the
cubic structure
and peaks from(111), (220), (311), (400), and (331) planes are in
agreement with the peaks referred to in the JCPDS card no. 37-1463.
Both Ag:ZnSe and Mn:ZnSe samples show all major peaks of pure ZnSe.
Moreover, the additional peaks represented by the black diamond suit
correspond to Ag2Se, which are well matched to JCPDS card
no. 24-1041, some of which correspond to reflection planes (020),
(112), (121), (122), and (220). The diffraction peaks of Ag:ZnSe doped
with different proportions of Ag+ show a small angular
shift, which may be caused by the lattice expansion caused by Ag+ substitution of Zn2+.24−26

of synthesized pure ZnSe, Ag- and Mn-doped
ZnSe samples confirming that all structures have a cubic structure.

For the Mn:ZnSe sample, in addition
to the cubic phase of ZnSe,
the peaks expressed by black club suit indicate the presence of MnSe,
which are well consistent with JCPDS card no. 27-0311. The diffraction
peak of the corresponding ZnSe in the Mn:ZnSe sample also shows a
small angular shift (Supporting Information Figure S1b), which may be caused by Mn2+ replacing part
of Zn2+ into the lattice of the material resulting in lattice
expansion.27

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the
chemical composition and the effect of doping on ZnSe. As can be seen
from Figure 3a, all
elements of Ag, Zn, and Se can be detected. The binding energies of
Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 are at 1021.3 and 1044.5
eV (Figure 3b), which
correspond to Zn2+.22 The Se
element in Figure 3c presents an asymmetric broad peak that can be fitted to two peaks
with binding energies at 53.8 and 54.6 eV, which are assigned to Se
3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively.23 In Figure 3d, the binding energy peaks of the Ag element at 367.9
and 374 eV are attributed to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively.24 The radius of Ag+(1.26 Å) is slightly larger than that of Zn2+(0.74 Å), indicating that Ag+ has the possibility
of replacing Zn2+ into the lattice of the material. In
addition, the diffraction peak in XRD shifted to a small angle because
of the lattice change, which show that part of Ag+ substituted
for Zn2+ is incorporated into the lattice of ZnSe.

Figure 3 (a) XPS spectrum
of ZnSe and Ag:ZnSe (3.125%); (b–d) high-resolution
spectrum of Zn 2p, Se 3d, and Ag 3d, respectively.

As shown in the Figure 4, the peak of the Mn element occurs in the
XPS spectrum of
Mn:ZnSe. The binding energies of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 are at 1021.4 and 1044.5 eV (Figure 4b), which correspond to Zn2+.
The Se element in Figure 4c is fitted to two peaks with binding energies at 53.8 and
54.6 eV, respectively, which are attributed to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively. The peak at 641.8 eV is attributed
to Mn 2p3/2 (Figure 4d), and the valence state of the corresponding Mn element
is +2.28,29 The radius of Mn2+ is 0.80 Å,
and the radius of Zn2+ is 0.74 Å, the results show
that Mn2+substituted Zn2+ doping into the ZnSe
lattice would cause lattice malformation, and confirm to the result
of the diffraction peak of Mn:ZnSe shifts to a small angle in the
XRD diagram, which also demonstrate that Mn2+ partially
replaces Zn2+ into ZnSe lattice.

and Mn:ZnSe (3.125%); (b–d) high-resolution
spectrum of Zn 2p, Se 3d, and Mn 2p, respectively.

2.2 Optical Analysis
As shown in Figure 3a, the absorption
edge of pure ZnSe is at 502 nm, and the corresponding band gap is
2.47 eV, which is shifted by 0.23 eV from bulk ZnSe (Eg = 2.7 eV), which is due to the agglomeration of microspheres
as seen in SEM images. Compared with the absorption edge of pure ZnSe,
the absorption edge of the Ag:ZnSe sample decreases with the increase
of the molar concentration of Ag doping (Figure 5a). While the absorption edge of the Mn:ZnSe
sample becomes larger as the molar concentration of Mn doping increases
(Figure 6a).

spectra and (b) Tauc plots of ZnSe and Ag-doped
ZnSe with varying Ag concentration.

Figure 6 (a) UV–visible spectra and (b) Tauc plots of ZnSe and Mn-doped
ZnSe with varying Mn concentration.

The Tauc relation was used to obtain the band gap of samples.
Compared
with the band gap of pure ZnSe (2.47 eV), with the increase of Ag
doping molar concentration, the band gap of Ag:ZnSe can be adjusted
to 2.56 eV when the Ag doping concentration reaches 9.375% (Figure 5b). While the band
gap of the Mn-doped ZnSe sample decreased, and the band gap of Mn:ZnSe
can be modulated to 1.9 eV when the Mn concentration is 9.375% (Figure 6b) (Supporting Information Table S1).

2.3 First-Principles
Calculation
In order
to facilitate the analysis of the influence of doping on the electronic
structure of ZnSe, the electronic band structure of the pure ZnSe
crystal was first calculated, as shown in Figure 7a, where the Fermi level shifts at zero point.
As can be seen from Figure 7a, ZnSe is a direct-band gap semiconductor material, and the
valence band top and the conduction band bottom are located at the
Γ point of the Brillouin area. Figure 7b shows the energy band structure of ZnSe
after 3.125% Ag doping. Compared with the energy band diagram of pure
ZnSe, it can be found that the Fermi level of crystal shift downward
into the valence band after Ag doping, together with new energy levels
near the Fermi level, which are associated with the localized Ag states
hybridized with ZnSe bulk states. Therefore, Ag-doped ZnSe produces
a p-type semiconductor.

Figure 7 (a) Band structure of pure ZnSe and (b) 3.125%
Ag-doped ZnSe. Red
dashed line is Fermi energy.

We also evaluated the evolution of band structures with increasing
the doping concentration of Ag. As shown in Figure 8, where three different concentrations of
3.125, 6.25, and 9.375% of Ag are plotted, the Fermi level shifts
downward steadily indicating an increasing hole concentration. With
heavily doped Ag, there exists clear band splitting and new levels
in the valence band, whereas the conduction bands keep almost the
same for the three doped cases.

Figure 8 (a) Band structure of 3.125% Ag-doped,
(b) 6.25% Ag-doped and (c)
9.375% Ag-doped ZnSe. Red dashed line is Fermi energy.

Concerning the effect of Mn doping, as can be seen
from Figure 9, the
introduction
of Mn causes significant states splitting while the Fermi level maintains
within the mid of the band gap. However, the Mn doping forms new flat
levels in the conduction band around 1.5 eV. Such new empty states
can host the light excited carriers which can explain the observed
increase in light absorption.

Figure 9 (a) Band structure of pure ZnSe and (b) 3.125%
Mn-doped ZnSe. The
black (red) lines correspond to spin up (down) states.

Similarly, we compare the band structures with
respect to the increase
of the Mn doping concentration from 3.125 % to 9.375% (Figure 10). The direct band gap characteristic
of ZnSe is maintained after doping Mn element. In the conduction band,
the localized levels associated with Mn broadens, leading to significant
splitting of the spin-up and spin-down states of host ZnSe.

structure of 3.125% Mn-doped, (b) 6.25% Mn-doped and (c)
9.375% Mn-doped ZnSe. Red dashed line is Fermi energy.

2.4 Electrical Property
The I–V measurement of pure
ZnSe, Ag- and Mn-doped
ZnSe was carried out at room temperature using the Keithley Source
Meter, the device structure was as shown in Figure S2. It is obvious that a nonlinear rectifying characteristic
behavior occurs because of the metal/semiconductor junction (Figures 11 and 12). Compared with that of pure ZnSe, it is observed
that a much higher current from films of Ag:ZnSe when the doping molar
concentration is above 3.125%, especially when the doping concentration
reaches 6.25%, the current of Ag:ZnSe increases dramatically, and
reaches to more than 2 orders of magnitude at 5 V when the doping
concentration increased to 9.375%.

Figure 11 I–V characteristics of
pure ZnSe and Ag:ZnSe samples with different doping ratios at room
temperature.

Figure 12 I–V characteristics of
pure ZnSe and Mn:ZnSe samples with different doping ratios at room
temperature.

Figure 10 shows
the current of pure ZnSe and Mn:ZnSe with different doping molar concentrations
of Mn. The similar phenomenon can be found and the current of Mn:ZnSe
increases with the increase of doping concentration, and the current
rises to the highest one when the doping concentration increased to
9.375%. It confirms that the conductivity of the sample can be enhanced
by appropriate doping treatment.

3 Conclusions
ZnSe, Ag- or Mn-doped ZnSe were synthesized by the hydrothermal
method. The results showed that different concentrations of doping
sources could cause significant changes in the morphology, optical
and electrical properties of the composite. The doping of Ag led to
the formation of rodlike structure, while Mn:ZnSe maintained the original
microsphere morphology of ZnSe. Compared with pure ZnSe, optical properties
indicated that the band gap caused by Ag doping increased, while the
band gap caused by Mn doping decreased with the increase of doping
concentration. In addition, compared with the electrical properties
of pure ZnSe, the doping of Ag and Mn caused an increase in the current
of ZnSe. When the doping concentration was 9.375%, the current of
Mn:ZnSe exhibited the highest. Through the theoretical calculation
of the first-principle plane-wave method, the abovementioned experimental
results were explained from the perspective of the energy band. These
results indicate that controlled doping of ZnSe is expected to expand
its application in optoelectronic devices.

4 Experimental
Section and Computational Details
ZnSe microspheres were
synthesized using the protocol we previously
reported.16 Typically, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O(0.03M) and sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) (0.03M) were chosen as source materials and
10 mL of hydrazine hydrate(N2H4·H2O) was used as reducing agent. With the alkaline medium of NaOH (0.67
M), the reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 4 h to synthesize
ZnSe microspheres. For the synthesis of Ag:ZnSe and Mn:ZnSe samples,
the protocols were similar to that of ZnSe microspheres mentioned
above. The only difference was that the proper amount of AgNO3 or Mn(NO3)2·4H2O was
added as source materials together with the as-synthesized ZnSe to
obtain various doped molar concentrations of Ag- or Mn-doped ZnSe
(3.125, 6.25, and 9.375%). The structure of ZnSe, Ag- or Mn-doped
ZnSe were explored by scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, 7800F)
and XRD. The optical properties and the I–V characteristics of samples were carried out by the UV–vis
spectrophotometer and Keithley Source meter 2400, respectively.

Our first-principles calculations were carried out by using Vienna
ab initio simulation package (VASP) package.17 The GGA-PBE functional was adopted to describe the exchange–correlation
interaction and a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was used. All the
structures were fully relaxed until the forces exerted on each atom
are less than 0.005 eV/Å. The relaxed lattice constant of bulk
ZnSe is 5.754 Å. To simulate the doped ZnSe, we built a 2 ×
2 × 2 supercell together with a 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack
grid for k-point sampling. The doping of Ag or Mn
atoms was modeled by directly substituting Zn atoms with Ag or Mn
atoms, respectively.
