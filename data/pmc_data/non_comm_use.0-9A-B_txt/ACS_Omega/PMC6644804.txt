Promoting
the production of industrially important aromatic chloroamines
over transition-metal nitrides catalysts has emerged as a prominent
theme in catalysis. This contribution provides an insight into the
reduction mechanism of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) to p-chloroaniline (p-CAN) over the γ-Mo2N(111) surface by means of density
functional theory calculations. The adsorption energies of various
molecularly adsorbed modes of p-CNB were computed.
Our findings display that, p-CNB prefers to be adsorbed
over two distinct adsorption sites, namely, Mo-hollow face-centered
cubic (fcc) and N-hollow hexagonal close-packed (hcp) sites with adsorption
energies of −32.1 and −38.5 kcal/mol, respectively.
We establish that the activation of nitro group proceeds through direct
pathway along with formation of several reaction intermediates. Most
of these intermediaries reside in a significant well-depth in reference
to the entrance channel. Central to the constructed mechanism is H-transfer
steps from fcc and hcp hollow sites to the NO/–NH groups through
modest reaction barriers. Our computed rate constant for the conversion
of p-CNB correlates very well with the experimental
finding (0.018 versus 0.033 s–1 at ∼500 K).
Plotted species profiles via a simplified kinetics model confirms
the experimentally reported high selectivity toward the formation
of p-CAN at relatively low temperatures. It is hoped
that thermokinetics parameters and mechanistic pathways provided herein
will afford a molecular level understanding for γ-Mo2N-mediated conversion of halogenated nitrobenzenes into their corresponding
nitroanilines; a process that entails significant industrial applications.

1 Introduction
Aromatic haloamine compounds
are important intermediates that are
extensively deployed in the manufacturing of various prominent chemicals,
most notably, drugs, pesticides, and pigments.1 The main preparation routes of these amines utilize metal–acid
systems or selective hydrogenation to the analogous haloanilines (HANs)
over noble-metal catalysts such as platinum and palladium.2−4 However, several parameters have hindered a mass-scale utilization
of these approaches in the production of HANs. These factors encompass
high operating cost and low selectivity toward the formation of HANs.
The latter is mainly attributed to hydrodehalogenation reactions that
also result in the formation of aniline (AN) and nitrobenzene (NB).5 Various factors may contribute to the catalytic
hydrogenation of Mo2N-based materials. The selectivity
underpinning reaction kinetics toward the synthesis of the desired
haloamine is greatly influenced by the synthesis conditions, most
notably, the Mo and N-precursors and other operational conditions
(deployed solvents, temperature, and pressure).1,6,7 The catalyst-assisted hydrogenation reduction
of aromatic molecules, in which molecular hydrogen plays a vital role
as a reducing agent, has attained considerable interest. This is owing
to the generation of less quantities of acid wastes when compared
with homogeneous chemical reduction reactions (i.e., the traditional
Bechamp reaction) or with the metal–acid system.8 In general, surface-mediated reduction of haloamines
outperforms homogeneous gas phase and acid-based reduction based on
generating less acidic wastes.9 Additionally,
the production of hydrogen chloride (HCl) from the hydrodechlorination
reaction affects the catalytic activity of the reactor.10 Thus, it is essential to improve heterogeneous
catalysts that enforce the occurrence of selective hydrogenation of
the nitro groups to the corresponding amino groups.

Recent related
developments have decreased the rate of inhibiting
the hydrodehalogenation during the reduction of halonitrobenzene via
the use of a variety of metal catalysts. For instance, an activated
carbon decorated with Pd nanoparticles of a size larger than 25 nm
in a 500 mL reactor was found to be highly selective toward the hydrogenation
of halogenated nitrobenzene of about 99.90%.11 Ma et al. investigated the influence of using Ir nanoparticles as
a support in activated carbon catalyst (Ir/C) for the hydrogenation
of halogenated nitrobenzene. They reported that high selectivity (>99%)
to p-chloroaniline (p-CAN) was accomplished
with a particle size of (<3 nm) Ir nanoparticles.12 Furthermore, a study of gas-phase hydrogenation of ortho-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB) to ortho-chloroaniline over Pd/Al2O3 catalyst
promoted by several alkali metals was reported by Vishwanathan et
al.13 It was revealed that the selectivity
of the reduction of o-CNB depends on the polarity
of the N=O bond in the −NO2 group.

However, the use of noble metals such as Pt and Pd is undesirable
due to the high cost and low catalytic stability, in which active
sites could be readily blocked under high pressure of deployed hydrogen.14 It is well established that transition-metal
nitride catalysts exhibit high catalytic performance in an array of
hydrogenation reactions. The partial hydrogenation of acetylene over
two unsupported phases of β-Mo2N and γ-Mo2N has recently been investigated.15

These synthesized catalysts were prepared by the temperature-programmed
reaction of MoO3 with N2 + H2. It
was found that high selectivity (77–90%) toward ethylene formation
could be attained over both β-Mo2N and γ-Mo2N crystallite phases. However, trivial amount of green oil
formation has been detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy over
γ-Mo2N in particular.

Cárdenas-Lizana
et al.16 stated
that a 100% selectivity of haloanilines was obtained during liquid-phase
hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB), over the crystal-phase Mo nitride catalysts. Furthermore,
they performed a reaction over alumina-supported palladium as a benchmark
catalyst. Nonselective behavior toward the production of nitrobenzene
(NB) and aniline (AN) from a combined hydrodechlorination/hydrogenation
has been detected. In another experimental work carried out under
atmospheric pressure at 493 K by the same group, p-CAN was the only intermediate from the −NO2 group’s
reduction via a reaction rate constant of k = 2.0
min–1.17 From theoretical
point of view, a computational study reported adsorption energies
and reaction barriers for the elementary steps involved in the p-CNB reduction paths over two sites of Pd catalysts, namely,
terrace and step.18 Their findings suggested
that the reaction barriers of the involved reactions are about the
same over Pd(111) and Pd(211) surfaces. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this contribution is the first to explore the reaction
pathways encountered during the p-CNB reduction over
the transition-metal nitride surface γ-Mo2N(111)
via the state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Routes for the formation of several reaction intermediates such
as chloronitrosobenzene (CNSB), chlorophenylhydroxylamine (CPHA),
dichloroazoxybenzene (CAOB), dichloroazobenzene (CAB), and dichlorohydrazobenzene
(CHAB) have comprehensively been reported. These intermediates are
highly toxic and resist oxidative decomposition, and, thus, their
formation should be minimized. The accumulation of these compounds
on the surface of the catalyst generally hinders the formation of p-CAN.5 This study has a 2-fold
aim: (i) to report reaction pathways for the reduction mechanism and
(ii) to predict kinetics parameters for all scanned steps. Thermokinetic
parameters reported herein should be instrumental in the pursuit to
formulate novel γ-Mo2N-based catalyst tailored for
specific industrial applications pertinent to sustainable chemical
treatment of halonitrobenzenes.

2 Computational
Details
All geometrical optimizations and energy and vibrations
calculations
were carried out by the DMol3 code19 using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient
approximation as the exchange–correlation functional.20 Localized double-numerical basis sets along
with polarization functions21 afford the
atomic environments. A Monkhorst–Pack k-points
mesh of (1 × 3 × 1) was used in the integration of the irreducible
part of the Brillion zone. In all calculations, we set the thermal
smearing at 0.01 Hartree. The convergence thresholds for energy, forces,
and displacements were 2 × 10–5 Ha, 4 ×
10–3 Ha/Å, and 5 × 10–4 Å, respectively, along with a global cutoff of 4.2 Å.
Dispersion correction term (DFT-D2) has also been implemented.22 The γ-Mo2N(111) surface as
reported in our previous work23 was found
to be the most energetically stable plane based on the ab initio atomistic
thermodynamic approach. This plane was constructed by a periodic four-layer
slab with a (2 × 2) supercell and a vacuum layer of 12 Å
to avoid interactions between periodic configurations along the z-direction. During the calculations, all the layers and
the adsorbates were allowed to fully relax. A test on one reaction
(i.e., two structures) using a global cutoff at 5.0 Å and 1 ×
5 × 1 k-points mesh changed its reaction energy
only marginally by ∼4%.

The transition states (TSs) were
derived by the linear synchronous
and quadratic synchronous transit method.24 Vibrational frequencies yield activation enthalpies and entropies
as a function of selected temperatures based on the Arrhenius formula: k(T) = A exp(−Ea/RT). The two kinetic parameters
(the A-factor and activation energy, Ea) were estimated by fitting reaction rate constants, k(T), with the inverse of temperature (1/T) according to the conventional transition-state theory
(TST).25

We calculated the adsorption
energies of γ-Mo2N/species systems according to  where Esurface+species refers to the energy of the studied system and Esurface+fixed species denotes the energy of a noninteracting
system in which the chemical species is fixed in the middle of the
slab separated from the surface by at least 6 Å. Finally, the
activation barriers represent the difference in energy between optimized
transition structures and reactants in each investigated step.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Molecular Adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene Over the γ-Mo2N(111)
Surface
While searching for the most energy preferable adsorption
site
of p-CNB over the γ-Mo2N(111) surface,
various orientations have been examined. The nature of the interaction
of the p-CNB molecule is primarily based on the position
in which the phenylene and nitro groups contribute in the adsorption
process. Consequently, the role of orientations in the molecular adsorbates
via the phenylene (flat) and nitro (upright) groups were often regarded
to be of prominence.4 Attempts to optimize
a physisorbed state along multiple rotations always converge to either
a vertical or a horizontal structure. The physisorbed energies of p-CNB over the γ-Mo2N(111) surface are
listed in Table 1,
whereas the side and top views of all the feasible geometries are
shown in Figure 1.
In the A1 configuration, the physisorption of p-CNB
occurs when both O atoms of the nitro group are directly adsorbed
at the top of two Mo atoms via double Mo–O bonding with an
average distance of 2.15 Å, yielding an adsorption energy of
−27.5 kcal/mol. The structure of A2 configuration depicted
in Figure 1 infers
that when the phenylene group is positioned flat to the 3-fold face-centered
cubic (fcc) (i.e., molybdenum vacant site), the adsorption occurs
only through a single Mo–O bond with a distance of 2.3 Å
with an associated adsorption energy of −32.1 kcal/mol.

A6	phenylene group of p-CNB adsorbs parallel on N-top site	–29.1

vertically on Mo-bridge site	–4.2	
When the p-CNB molecule is positioned horizontally
and above the 3-fold hexagonal close-packed (hcp) nitrogen vacant
site, another adsorption structure can be obtained, namely, the A3
configuration. In this configuration, all of the C atoms of the phenylene
group are bounded to the surface Mo atoms through atomic distances
of ∼2.26 Å with an adsorption energy of −22.0 kcal/mol.
A4 and A6 structures entail very similar adsorption energies of −28.8
and −29.1 kcal/mol, respectively, in which the p-CNB is placed at the top of a surface N atom. In the A5 structure,
the nitro group is linked to the surface via two O atoms at the top
of two neighboring Mo atoms, i.e., the phenylene group is perpendicularly
positioned above the γ-Mo2N(111) plane. The formed
two Mo–O bonds amount to 2.27 Å, with an estimated adsorption
energy of −38.5 kcal/mol, indicating genuine chemical bonds.
However, when the nitro group was initially situated upright at the
top of a surface nitrogen atom (A7), the p-CNB molecule
directly desorbed with a height of ∼4.01 Å following full
optimization. This could be attributed to the repulsion between the
two negatively charged N and O entities. This phenomenon incurs the
highest adsorption energy of only −4.2 kcal/mol. In a comparison
with other systems, DFT calculations were utilized to estimate the
adsorption energies of p-CAN over several Pd surfaces
(including steeped, flat) and clusters. Adsorption energies were found
to reside in the range of −39.2 to −61.11 kcal/mol.26

The overall aim of the hydrohalogenation
process is to convert
the nitro group (−NO2) of p-CNB
into an amine group (−NH2) while leaving the chlorine
atom at the para site of the phenyl ring. Careful inspection of the
geometries in Figure 1 reveals that the horizontal-like adsorbed A2 structure is a structurally
suitable to undergo hydrogenation of the nitro group. This adsorption
mode is most likely to happen on the catalyst surface because it affords
the lowest adsorption energy. Furthermore, the flat-like configuration
of A2 makes it more geometrically oriented toward surface-mediated
hydrogenation of its nitro group. For these reasons, we elect to consider
the A2 configuration as the initial structure in the hydrohalogenation
mechanism of the p-CNB molecule.

3.2 Mechanisms of Chloronitrobenzene Hydrogenation
to Chloroaniline
Literature presents various reaction routes
for the hydrogenation of p-CNB molecule into p-CAN over a wide array of potential catalysts. Herein,
guided by the experimental results16,27 and in view
of the previously suggested analogous mechanisms,12,18 we investigate the reduction mechanism of p-CNB
into p-CAN mediated by the γ-Mo2N(111) surface. To survey plausible formation of side products, various
routes were inspected, depending on which bond is easier to break,
the C–Cl bond or the N=O bond.28Scheme 1 depicts
the proposed pathways for the surface-assisted conversion of p-CNB into p-CAN. The direct reduction
mechanism proceeds via the formation of nitroso and hydroxylamine
compounds (via mechanism A). However, throughout condensation–reduction,
the formation of azoxybenzene and azobenzene intermediates (mechanism
C) takes place. Furthermore, the formation of the undesired toxic
intermediates (i.e., azoxybenzene and azobenzene) must be suppressed
during the hydrogenation mechanism. Further hydrogenolysis of the
substituted position in the parent p-CNB molecule
or intermediates leads to the formation of aniline (AN) and nitrobenzene
(NB),29 although not to a large extent.

arrows refer to the direct
reduction (mechanism A), dashed arrows depict (mechanism B), whereas
plain arrows represent the condensation reduction routes (mechanism
C).

3.2.1 Direct Dissociation Pathways
Reduction
of p-CNB to p-CAN involves subsequent
fission of N–O bond by which chloronitrosobenzene (CNSB) and
chlorophenylhydroxylamine (CPHA) compounds are formed as byproducts.
Two possible pathways feature hydrogen-induced detachment reactions
(i.e., mechanisms A and B), whereas a third potential mechanism involves
a self-condensation route (mechanism C). Acquiring detailed potential
energy surfaces for these three alternate routes determines the most
kinetically preferred route for the experimentally observed products
of the hydrogenation process.

3.2.1.1 Mechanism A
It is very experimentally
challenging to determine to what extent the prehydrogenation of p-CNB contributes to the N–O bond rupture in reference
to thermal fission process (i.e., noncatalytic process). The calculated
adsorption energy of the p-CNB molecule over prehydrogenated
surface was −7.3 kcal/mol. This value is substantially lower
than the corresponding adsorption energy of the p-CNB molecule over
the neat surface at −22.0 kcal/mol (for the A3 structure later).
However, based on the facile process dictating the dissociative adsorption
of hydrogen molecules,30 it is expected
that active sites of the Mo2N(111) surface are prehydrogenated
at the temperature of the experiment.

This has motivated us
to investigate the dissociation pathway in which the N–O bond
is cleaved directly without the involvement of adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Figure 2 displays the potential
energy profile for the direct N–O bond fission. The calculated
reaction energy for the reaction ClC6H4NO2* (D1) → ClC6H4NO* + O* is slightly
exothermic by 2.8 kcal/mol; nevertheless, it associated with a sizable
energy barrier of 47.7 kcal/mol via the transition state structure
(TSD). Clearly, such a high barrier hinders the occurrence
of the direct surface-assisted N–O bond scission at the experimental
temperature of 493 K.16 This finding correlates
with the high barrier computed (37.1 kcal/mol) for the corresponding
direct fission of the N–O bonds in the case of nitrobenzene
(C6H5NO2) reduction to aniline (C6H5NH2) over Pt catalyst.31

Figure 2 Reaction energy and activation barrier (in kcal/mol) for
the direct
fission of the N–O bond.

Figure 3 shows
the
structures, reaction, and activation energies for all the steps involved
in Mechanism A, whereas Figure 4 depicts the corresponding potential energy surface in reference
to the initial reactant. The direct dissociation pathway via hydrogen
transfer from the surface proceeds by several elementary steps initiated
by hydrogenating the first O atom of the nitro group (−NO2). This process weakens the relatively strong N–O bond
(70.7 kcal/mol)32 and thus facilitates
the subsequent N–O bond dissociations. Hydrogen-transfer reactions
from different adsorption sites, i.e., top of N atom and 3-fold hcp
vacant site have been investigated. We found that hydrogen transfer
from the N top site requires a significantly higher barrier in reference
to the analogous transfer from the 3-fold hcp N-hollow site, 13.3
versus 25.3 kcal/mol. The dependency of the catalytic hydrogenation
capacity of Mo2N largely depends on the existence of nitrogen
vacant sites, as we demonstrated in our previous work on the selective
hydrogenation of acetylene to ethene over Mo2N surfaces.33 Starting with the first atomic H* transfer to
the O atom in p-CNB via the reaction (1) ClC6H4NO2* (M1) + H* → ClC6H4NO2H*, the computed reaction energy was found
to be 8.1 kcal/mol above the entrance channel. The corresponding activation
barrier amounts to 13.3 kcal/mol characterized by the transition structure
TS1 as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Structures of the intermediates and transition states for the steps
involved in the conversion of p-CNB to p-CAN on γ-Mo2N(111) (mechanisms A (black) and B
(red) arrows). Activation barriers and reaction energies are computed
in reference to reactants in each step. All values are in kcal/mol.

Figure 4 Potential energy surface for the conversion
of p-CNB to p-CAN on γ-Mo2N(111) (mechanisms
A (black) and B (red) dotted lines). All energies are in reference
to M1.

To demonstrate the catalytic capacity
of the γ-Mo2N(111), we have considered the homogeneous
uncatalyzed first step
hydrogenation step of the NO site in the parent p-CBN molecule. H transfer from a hydrogen molecule to the NO site
was found to incur a sizable barrier of 59.2 kcal/mol. This value
significantly overshoots the analogous catalyzed H transfer step at
13.3 kcal/mol.

Upon the hydrogenation of the first N–O
bond into N–OH,
its length stretches from 1.25 to 1.36 Å, marking its activation.
Subsequent to this step, the second reaction (2A) ClC6H4NO2H* (M2) + H* → ClC6H4NO* + H2O* proceeds with an energy barrier of 23.1 kcal/mol
(TS2A) forming adsorbed chloronitrosobenzene (CNSB) ClC6H4NO* as an intermediate and water molecule. This reaction
is exothermic with energy of 42.0 kcal/mol (M3A). Desorption of H2O* from surface into a gas-phase water molecule requires only
10.0 kcal/mol. Although this path would expedite the deoxygenation
in comparison with the direct N–O fission route (23.1 versus
47.7 kcal/mol), further hydrogenation is necessary to complete the
catalytic cycle into p-CAN. We accordingly presumed
that, after water desorption, the initial configuration of ClC6H4NO* and the adsorbed atomic H remain in the same
initial state as in reaction (2A).

In the transition structure
TS3A (reaction (3A) ClC6H4NO* (M3A) + H* →
ClC6H4NOH*), an adsorbed H* migrates into the
oxygen atom in the ClC6H4NO* radical. This step
results in the formation
of the adsorbed ClC6H4NOH (M4A), in which the
N–O bond elongates by 19% in reference to the analogous distance
in M3A. This reaction is exothermic by 8.9 kcal/mol, with a modest
hydrogenation barrier of 14.2 kcal/mol via TS3A. Subsequent hydrogen
transfer into the adsorbed ClC6H4NOH* moiety
via reaction (R4A), ClC6H4NOH* (M4A) + H* →
ClC6H4NHOH* (M5) affords the adduct moiety of
ClC6H4NHOH (M5). This step ensues in an exothermic
reaction by 12.0 kcal/mol and occurs via an activation barrier of
25.3 kcal/mol characterized by TS4A. In the next step (R5), a water
molecule is eliminated through the movement of a surface H* atom into
the hydroxyl group of the M5 adduct. The activation barrier for this
step amounts to 16.2 kcal/mol via TS5.

Finally, an adsorbed p-CAN molecule is produced
through the attachment of an H* atom to the NH group in ClC6H4NH* (M6) as revealed in reaction (6). The reaction ClC6H4NH* (M6) + H* → ClC6H4NH2* (M7) completes the reduction mechanism of p-CNB into p-CAN. This final H* transfer
is accomplished through the transition-state structure that signifies
a reaction barrier of 12.5 kcal/mol (TS6). The adsorbed p-CAN in the M7 configuration resides in a well-depth of 28.3 kcal/mol
in reference to M6. Consequently, it is inferred that the hydrogenation
step of chlorophenylhydroxylamine (CPHA, M5) in reaction (R4A) incurs
the highest activation barrier and is most likely to resemble the
rate-limiting step. The overall reaction in mechanism A, as given
in Figure 4, is exothermic
by 20.2 kcal/mol.

3.2.1.2 Mechanism B
This mechanism differs
from mechanism A with regard to the nature of reactions (2)–(4). Figure 3 represents the structure
of elementary reactions in the hydrogenation of p-CNB (mechanism B, in red arrows). Figure 4 depicts the corresponding potential energy
surface. In reaction (2B) ClC6H4NO2H* (M2) + H* → ClC6H4NO2H2*, the second O’s atom of the nitro group is hydrogenated
via another hydrogen transfer step termed as the double H-induced
dissociation, in which the nitro group is doubly hydrogenated to N(OH)2 group before the dissociation of the first N–OH bond.
This step requires an energy barrier of 19.0 kcal/mol (TS2B). The
reaction energy of the new synthesized intermediate ClC6H4NO2H2* (M3B) is found to be slightly
endothermic by 3.3 kcal/mol. After double hydrogenation of the nitro
group, the hydrogen transfer from the 3-fold hcp vacant site to the
hydroxyl’s group in M3B liberates a water molecule, in analogous
reactions to those illustrated in mechanism A, i.e., via the reaction
(3B) ClC6H4NO2H2* (M3B)
+ H* → ClC6H4NOH* + H2O*.
One of the OH group in the ClC6H4NO2H2* intermediate departs the M3B moiety simultaneously
with the movement of an adsorbed H* atom forming adsorbed ClC6H4NOH*
(M4B) adduct, as characterized by the transition structure TS3B via
a very sizable activation barrier of 55.8 kcal/mol. This elementary
step appears to be exothermic by 23.0 kcal/mol. The desorption energy
of released water molecule is predicted to be 18.9 kcal/mol, leaving
behind an adsorbed ClC6H4NOH* adduct. The next
step (ClC6H4NOH* (M4B) + H* → ClC6H4NHOH* (M5)) features a hydrogen transfer into
the OH group via TS4B. Barrier for this step stands at 38.7 kcal/mol.
Comparing the activation energies required for the corresponding steps
in both mechanisms A and B, it is obvious that the activation energy
of the mechanism A is generally lower than that in the analogous steps
in mechanism B (23.1/14.2/25.3 versus 19.0/55.8/38.7 kcal/mol); nonetheless,
the barrier for the opening step in mechanism B is slightly lower
than that of mechanism A (i.e., 23.1 versus 19.0 kcal/mol). By reaching
the M5 intermediate, the rest of the steps are the same as in mechanism
A.

3.2.2 Aniline Formation via
Indirect Reaction
Pathway (i.e., Condensation Pathway, Mechanism C)
Another
expected reduction route proceeds through the formation of dichloroazoxybenzene
(CAOB) as an important intermediate in the surface-assisted coupling
of ClC6H4NO* (the structure M3A in mechanisms
A). The structure of dichloroazobenzene (Cl2C12H8N2*) (CAB) is generated by another hydrogen
transfer reaction of dichloroazoxybenzene (Cl2C12H8N2O*), (CAOB). Furthermore, dichlorohydrazobenzene
(Cl2C12H8N2H2*) (CHAB) is the final moiety before the production of p-CAN by breaking the azo bonds. The latter term refers to the (−N=N−)
bond in which two halophenylene rings are linked. Figure 5 displays the configurations
involved in the condensation pathways that constitute unimolecular
and bimolecular reactions of mechanism C. Figure 6 depicts the potential energy surface for
the condensation pathway. Table 2 lists the activation barriers and the reactions energies
for all the elementary steps involved in the condensation pathway.

The first four reactions are exactly the same
as in mechanisms
A and B. Thus, we commence tracking mechanism C by the step that leads
to the generation of chlorophenylhydroxylamine (structure M2C Figure 5) via the presence
of adjacent preadsorbed ClC6H4NO* and ClC6H4NHOH* adducts (M1C). In the structure of M2C
formed via the reaction (ClC6H4NO* + ClC6H4NHOH* (M1C) → ClC12H8N2O* + H2O*), an azo bond accompanies the elimination
of a water molecule. The formation of the dichloroazoxybenzene (CAOB)
(ClC12H8N2O*) intermediate is exothermic
by 29.0 kcal/mol. Most intermediates in the condensation pathway are
linked with the surface via bonding O atoms with a Mo surface site.
Desorption of H2O into a gas-phase water molecule requires
a desorption energy of 29.2 kcal/mol. Although this coupling reaction
is noticeably exothermic, it demands a sizable barrier of 53.3 kcal/mol
(TS1C). Clearly, such a high barrier presents a bottleneck for the
condensation pathway and indicates that the condensation route is
highly unlikely to proceed kinetically via flat placed molecules.
The barrier of TS1C is in well accord with the analogous barrier for
the corresponding step encountered in the condensation pathway over
the Pd3/Pt(111) surface (i.e., 52.12 kcal/mol).34 Considering the near-flat initial ClC6H4NO* + ClC6H4NHOH* structures,
the activation barrier of TS1C is increased by ∼8.0 kcal/mol
compared with the near-vertical structures depicted in Figure 5.

The reduction reaction
of dichloroazoxybenzene (M2C) in the reaction
(R2C) Cl2C12H8N2O* (M2C)
+ H* → Cl2C12H8N2OH* was found to be endothermic by 58.4 kcal/mol (M3C), with a very
sizable activation energy 69.6 kcal/mol via (TS2C). This high barrier
is attributed to the energy required for breaking the surface Mo–O
bond in the M2C configuration. Upon hydrogen transfer, the N–O
bond is stretched by 0.10 Å in reference to the N–O bond
in the M2C structure. A third hydrogen transfer reaction generates
dichloroazobenzene (CAB) (M4C) via the reaction (R3C): Cl2C12H8N2OH* (M3C) + H* → Cl2C12H8N2* + H2O*.
This step proceeds via a considerable activation barrier of 54.6 kcal/mol
through (TS3C) in reference to the M3C intermediate. The formed dichloroazobenzene
(M4C) consequently reacts with an adsorbed H* atom, resulting in the
formation of the Cl2C12H8N2H* intermediate (M5C) through reaction (R4C). This step requires
an energy barrier of 60.2 kcal/mol via transition state structure
(TS4C) and releases an excess energy of about −32.6 kcal/mol.
The next step in the proposed mechanism is a reaction (R5C) in which
dichlorohydrazobenzene moiety can be generated as a result of hydrogen
transfer from 3-fold fcc vacant site. This reaction was found to be
exothermic reaction by 19.4 kcal/mol (M6C), with an estimated barrier
of 23.0 kcal/mol as represented in the transition structure (TS5C).
Fragmentation of dichlorohydrazobenzene into adsorbed p-CAN molecule and ClC6H4NH* radical proceeds
by the attachment of hydrogen atom to the N atom in dichlorohydrazobenzene
reaction (R6C). This reaction is highly exothermic by 47.1 kcal/mol
and necessitates a high activation energy of about 58.7 kcal/mol over
M7C through the transition structure TS6C, correspondingly. A p-CAN molecule forms via attachment of a surface H* with
the NH group in the ClC6H4NH* moiety (M7C) along
the reaction (R7C) with an activation barrier of 34.6 kcal/mol (TS7C).
All in all, the high activation barriers for these reactions could
be attributed to the strong N–O and N–N bonds that are
broken during the course of the mechanism.

Finally, it is of
interest to shed some light on the barrier for
a plausible chlorination of p-CNB to nitrobenzene
(NB). We therefore investigate the dechlorination reactions of p-CNB into nitrobenzene via the fission of the C–Cl
bond (ClC6H4NO2* → C6H4NO2* + Cl*). Figure 7 portrays the optimized structures involved
in this reaction. Our findings indicate that the direct fission of
the Cl–C bond is associated with a high energy barrier of 58.0
kcal/mol. This high barrier supports the experimental observation
of Perret et al.,27 who tested two crystallographic
phases of molybdenum nitride, namely, β-Mo2N and
γ-Mo2N. They concluded that both the studied crystals
promoted the selective nitro group reduction into amino group and
suppressed the dehalogenation step.

3.3 Reaction Rates and Kinetics
Both
β and γ phases of Mo2N display similar adsorption
sites. The unit cells for both surfaces only differ in their c-lattice, and, hence, our calculated kinetics for the γ
phase should resemble the experimental values for the γ phase.35 We predict the thermokinetic parameters for
the hydrogenation reaction of the p-CNB molecule
in the molybdenum nitride system. Table 3 reports the Arrhenius parameters and the
activation barriers for the reactions in mechanisms A and B, whereas Figure 8 demonstrates the
Arrhenius plots for reactions in the forward directions involved in
direct dissociation routes. A useful feature of the reaction rate
parameters provided in Table 3 is to assess the relative importance of the potentially competing
reactions. For instance, based on the reaction rate constants reported
in Table 3, reaction
(R2A) largely predominates the competing reaction (R2B).

By plotting the residence time (τ) in the plug
flow reactor
(PFR) against ln (1/1 – X), where X is the conversion of p-CNB, Cárdenas-Lizana
et al.16 attained the overall consumption
rate of ∼2.0 min–1 (i.e., 0.033 s–1) for p-CNB at 493 K and τ between 1800 and
7800 s. Now, we are in a position to compare our kinetic analysis
with the experimentally obtained overall rate constant.16 Inspection of the potential energy surface in Figure 4 reveals that the
overall activation barrier for the reduction of p-CNB into p-CAN corresponds to the R2A reaction
with a net activation barrier of 31.2 kcal/mol (i.e., the height of
TS2A in reference to M1). By considering a typical value of the A factor at 1.0 × 1013 s–1, we obtain an overall consumption rate for p-CNB
at 0.018 s–1 (at 493 K). Clearly, our computed rate
constant for the conversion of p-CNB correlates very
well with the experimental finding of Cárdenas-Lizana et al.
(0.018 versus 0.033 s–1).

Following the formation
of the M3A structure, all the intermediates
and transition states reside below the entrance channel. Thus, the
formation of p-CAN from p-CNB could
be modeled based on the two opening reactions (R1) and (R2A). Herein,
we consider a simplified plug flow reactor (PFR) model to compute
the conversion (X) of p-CAN from p-CNB. Central to this simplified treatment is the assumption
that all the reactions are treated as unimolecular reactions in view
of the great excess of p-CNB in reference to inlet
H2 in the experimental conditions (i.e., 0.99 versus 0.01).
The simplified PFR model utilizes the specified experimental conditions
by Cárdenas-Lizana et al. These conditions comprise a reactor
volume of 8.0 × 10–5 m3 (with an
internal diameter of 0.015 m) and an inlet molar flow rate of p-CNB at 8.0 × 10–8 mol/s. The initial
concentration of p-CNB was fixed at 0.24 mol/m3. The model consists of design PFR differential equations  that
relate to the change in the molar
flow rate (f) of the three considered species (M1,
M2, and M3A), with the PFR’s volume (V) and
the rate of the reaction (r) along the reaction sequence  The reactions are considered to be elementary
with respect to the concentration (C)  Rate constant
values at 493 K for reactions
(R1) and (R2) are taken from Table 2. The reverse reaction (R2A) was added to account for
the fast reaction in the backward direction (i.e., activation energy
is only 5.5 kcal/mol). Figure 9a contrasts our modeled X values with their
analogous experimental values for τ between 1800 and 7800 s.
The latter can be varied by adjusting the reactor’s volume
in reference to the volumetric flow rate. Our computed X values slightly overshoot the corresponding experimental estimates.
Nonetheless, our simplified PFR model reasonably reproduces the experimental
profile pertinent to the consumption of p-CNB. Figure 9b,c portrays the
computed concentrations of species and conversion/selectivity (S) down the length of the PFR reactor. The latter signifies
the ratio for the molar flow rate of species M3A to the inlet molar
flow rate of M1. It serves to provide an estimate for the fraction
of M1 that is converted into M3A. As elaborated earlier and based
on the facile nature of all the subsequent reactions (R3A–R6),
we envisage that the calculated S value for the intermediate
M3A largely represents the analogous value for p-CAN.

and experimental conversion values. (b) Calculated

4 Conclusions
In this study, via density
functional theory (DFT-D2) calculations,
we map out mechanisms underlying the selective hydrogenation of p-CNB to p-CAN over the γ-Mo2N(111) surface catalyst. The two most energetically favorable
adsorption sites are found when chloronitrobenzene is flat and upright
positioned to the Mo-hollow fcc and the N-hollow hcp of γ-Mo2N(111) surface, respectively. We establish that the reduction
of p-CNB to p-CAN proceeds through
the direct and indirect (condensation) pathways; however, the direct
pathway systematically requires lower activation barriers. Based on
the TST theory, reaction rate constants are evaluated for the reactions
involved in direct pathways (mechanisms A and B). The reduction process
involves several steps of H* transfer from the surface (mainly at
fcc and hcp sites) into NO moieties. The high barrier for direct fission
of the C–Cl bond clearly hinders the formation of an aniline
molecule. The hydrogenation of chloronitrosobenzene is considered
to be the rate-limiting step with an energetic barrier of 55.8 kcal/mol.
Desorption of water molecules entails lower desorption energies. Mechanisms
and kinetic analyses (via a simplified PFR’s model) presented
herein illustrate the pathways for the experimentally observed hydrogenation
of the nitro group at relatively low temperatures. Our findings systematically
provide a comprehensive understanding into the selective catalysis
of such large aromatic molecules and reveal the promising role of
γ-Mo2N surface in producing commercially important
organic amino compounds.
