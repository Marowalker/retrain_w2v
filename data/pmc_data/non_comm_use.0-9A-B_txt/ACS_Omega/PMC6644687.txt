A SiOC
membrane with high oxidative stability for gas separation
was tailored by utilizing vinyltrimethoxysilane, triethoxysilane,
and 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane as Si precursors. Amorphous SiOC
networks were formed via the condensation of Si–OH groups,
the hydrosilylation of Si–H and Si–CH=CH2 groups, and a crosslinking reaction of Si–CH3 groups, respectively. The crosslinking of Si–CH3 groups at temperatures ranging from 600 to 700 °C under a N2 atmosphere was quite effective in constructing a Si–CH2–Si unit without the formation of mesopores, which
was confirmed by the results of N2 adsorption and by the
gas permeation properties. The network pore size of the SiOC membrane
calcined at 700 °C under N2 showed high oxidative
stability at 500 °C and was appropriate for the separation of
large molecules (H2/CF4 selectivity: 640, H2/SF6: 2900, N2/CF4: 98).
A SiOC membrane calcined at 800 °C showed H2/N2 selectivity of 62, which was approximately 10 times higher
than that calcined at 700 °C because the SiOC networks were densified
by the cleavage and redistribution reactions of Si–C and Si–O
groups.

Introduction
A simple, energy-conserving,
high-performance separation system
is possible via membrane-based separation (permeance, selectivity,
and stability). This process has the potential to replace conventional
separation processes, such as distillation and adsorption. Thus, many
types of materials have been used in membrane development: polymer,1,2 zeolite,3−5 amorphous silica,6,7 and carbon
molecular sieves.8,9 Amorphous silica membranes have
been studied intensively due to a microporous structure that can withstand
1000 °C with a high degree of chemical stability. However, the
network pore sizes of conventional amorphous SiO2 membranes
are only suitable for the separation of small molecules such as H2/N2 and H2/CH4, and silica
networks are easily densified under a hydrothermal atmosphere, which
results from the condensation of Si–OH groups, particularly
at high temperatures.10,11

The ability to introduce
organic functional groups into an amorphous
silica structure enlarges the network pore size, which improves hydrothermal
stability.12−14 These attributes make the silicon oxycarbide (SiOC)
structure a good candidate for tailoring the pore size of a network
with a high degree of stability. The SiOC structure is generally derived
from the SiC structure in polydimethylsilane (PMS),15−17 polycarbosilane,18−22 and polysilastyrene,23 followed by electron
beam irradiation20,22 and oxidation curing.16−19 Lee and Tsai15 evaluated the effect of
heat treatment on the gas permeation properties of SiOC membranes,
which were prepared via the pyrolysis of PMS at temperatures ranging
from 300 to 600 °C under an Ar atmosphere. A SiOC membrane fabricated
at 600 °C showed H2 permeance of 4.9 × 10–9 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1 with a H2/N2 permeance ratio
of 41 at 200 °C. A trend was confirmed whereby H2 permeance
is largely decreased as the temperature of heat treatment increases
due to a densification of the PMS structures. The optimization of
pyrolysis conditions can be used to tailor the thermally stable SiOC
networks for H2 separation, but further efforts are required
to tailor a looser network structure.

In 2014, our research
group fabricated SiOC membranes by utilizing
triethoxysilane (TRIES), vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS), and 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane
(TMDSO) as Si precursors via sol–gel processing.24 A SiOC membrane calcined at 400 °C under
a N2 atmosphere showed a loose network structure, but the
chemical structure and gas permeation properties of SiOC membranes
calcined at high temperatures have not been verified. Several papers
have reported the introduction of Si–CH2–Si
units via a crosslinking of the Si–CH3 groups above
600 °C under an Ar atmosphere, and surprisingly these studies
reported no change in the SiOC structures that were created even after
calcination at 900 °C.25 However,
no study has focused on tailoring the SiOC structure for use in a
molecular sieving membrane via a crosslinking of the Si–CH3 groups at high temperature.

In the present study, a
SiOC network structure with high oxidative
stability for gas separation was tailored by utilizing VTMS, TRIES,
and TMDSO as Si precursors. Figure 1 shows a schematic image of the formation of an amorphous
SiOC structure. First, silsesquioxane (SQ, RSiO1.5) networks
were formed by the hydrolysis and polymerization reactions of VTMS
and TRIES. Then, TMDSO was introduced into SQ networks via hydrosilylation.
After gelation of the film, crosslinking reactions of Si–CH3 groups at high temperatures were conducted to control the
network pore size for gas separation. The effects of calcination temperatures
on the SiOC network structures and on the gas permeation properties
of SiOC membranes were evaluated according to single-gas permeation
properties. The oxidative stability of SiOC membranes was also evaluated
by measuring the time courses of gas permeance during air treatment
at 500 °C. The SiOC structure was characterized via solid-state
NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and N2 adsorption
experiments.

network.

Results and Discussion
Characterizing the SiOC
Structure
In the present study,
a Pt catalyst was added to the SQ sol derived from TRIES and VTMS
to introduce TMDSO into the SQ network via hydrosilylation. The effect
of the Pt catalyst on the reactivity of the Si–H groups in
TMDSO was evaluated via FT-IR. Figure 2 shows the FT-IR spectra ranging from 500 to 4000 cm–1 for uncalcined SiOC films, which were prepared by
coating SiOC sols with/without a Pt catalyst onto a Si wafer. The
antisymmetric stretching vibration bonds of Si–O–Si
(va Si–O–Si) appeared between 1000 and 1150
cm–1 26−29 for both samples, which indicated that the hydrolysis
and condensation reactions had formed siloxane networks regardless
of the absence or presence of a Pt catalyst.

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra for uncalcined
SiOC films prepared from a SiOC sol
with/without the addition of a Pt catalyst.

The two split peaks appearing at 2100 and 2320 cm–1 were assigned to the Si–H symmetric stretching vibration
bonds (vs Si–H). The Si–H peaks that appeared
at 2250 and 2140 cm–1 were derived from TRIES28,30,31 and TMDSO,32,33 respectively. The SiOC film prepared from the sol without a Pt catalyst
showed two types of Si–H peaks, whereas that with a Pt catalyst
showed a weak Si–H peak derived from TMDSO. Peaks at 1600 and
1410 cm–1 assigned to Si–C=C stretching
vibration bonds (v Si–C=C)34 were decreased in the film prepared with a Pt catalyst. Thus, we
concluded that the hydrosilylation of Si–H groups and Si–C=C
groups in eq 1 had proceeded
with the addition of a Pt catalyst to the SQ sol at a low temperature
(40 °C or less).35 1  Since the Si–C=C groups
in VTMS
and the TRIES-derived Si–H groups in TRIES–VTMS hybrid
polymers are located separately via the formation of Si–O–Si
bonds caused by the hydrolysis and condensation of Si–OCH3 and Si–OC2H5 groups, the reactivity
of intermolecular hydrosilylation between the Si–C=C
groups in VTMS and the TRIES-derived Si–H groups might be low.
TMDSO can only be introduced in the SQ structure via hydrosilylation,
which means that the Si–H groups in TMDSO could preferentially
react with the Si–C=C groups in VTMS.

The peak
at 1260 cm–1 was assigned to the CH3 symmetric
bending vibration bonds (δs CH3) derived
from Si–CH3, and the peak at 2963
cm–1 was assigned to the CH3 asymmetric
stretching vibrations (vas CH3) in Si–CH3 in TMDSO and/or in the methoxy and ethoxy groups, respectively.26,33,36 These peaks were definitively
detected in the SiOC film prepared from the sol with a Pt catalyst,
which was consistent with the results from the introduction of TMDSO
in the SQ structure. Both samples showed peaks at 3000 and 3600 cm–1 corresponding to the OH groups of Si–OH and
to the adsorbed water.25

Figure 3 shows the
thermogravimetry (TG) curve and mass signal (m/z) for SiOC gel under a He atmosphere. A weight loss of
approximately 5% was confirmed for temperatures ranging from 200 to
600 °C, which likely were caused by condensation from the Si–OH
groups.37 The resultant weight loss of
approximately 5% was confirmed at temperatures ranging from 600 to
800 °C, and two mass peaks (m/z = 2, 16) corresponding to H2 and CH4 were
detected. Thus, we concluded that the crosslinking reactions of Si–CH3 groups expressed in eqs 2 and 3 occurred at 600 and 800 °C,
respectively, under an inert atmosphere.25,31,38−41 2   3  The
SiOC gel showed no weight loss at temperatures
ranging from 800 to 1000 °C, which indicated a completion of
the related reactions and decomposition of the crosslinking units.
The SiOC gel showed a residual weight of approximately 90% even after
heat treatment at 1000 °C.

rate, 10 °C min–1; flow rate, 300 mL min–1).

Figure 4 shows the
solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning
(CP MAS)-NMR signals of SiOC gels ranging from −50 to 250 ppm
(a) and a highly magnified version that ranged from −15 to
15 ppm (b). The signal detected at 6.0 ppm of uncalcined gel was assigned
to Si–C2H4–Si linking units42−44 that were formed via hydrosilylation with a Pt catalyst. Another
intense signal at approximately 0.3 ppm that corresponded to the −CH3 groups derived from TMDSO40,45 was detected
in uncalcined gel.

Figure 4 Solid-state 13C CP MAS-NMR spectra ranging
from −50
to 250 ppm (a); a highly magnified version ranging from −15
to 15 ppm (b) for uncalcined and calcined SiOC gels (500–800
°C, N2 atmosphere) (* corresponds to the spinning
side bands).

These signals showed
no differences when a sample was calcined
below 500 °C, but a downfield signal shift occurred when the
temperature was raised above 600 °C. The sample calcined at 600
°C showed an intense signal at −0.6 ppm that was assigned
to the −CH2– groups in the Si–CH2–Si linking units46,47 and was caused
by the crosslinking reaction of Si–CH3 groups, as
expressed in eqs 2 and 3. The signal at 6.0 ppm that was assigned to the
Si–C2H4–Si unit was decreased
above 600 °C due to cleavage of the Si–C2H4–Si unit.

The sample calcined at 800 °C
showed a signal at −7.6
ppm that was assigned to the Si–CH3 groups formed
by the cleavage of crosslinking units.47 The broad signal at around 130 ppm with spinning side bands (176
and 84 ppm) was assigned to the aromatic carbon atoms,45,48,49 and the formation of a free-carbon
phase at 800 °C was indicated by the partial decomposition of
Si–CH3 groups and/or organic linking units.41,47

Figure 5 shows
the
solid-state 29Si MAS-NMR spectra of SiOC gels using the
same samples measured for the 13C CP MAS-NMR spectra. The
signals appearing at approximately −17.1, −65.5, −101,
and −110 ppm in the uncalcined sample can be ascribed to (SiC2)2O (DTMDSO unit),50 SiO3C (T unit),39,47 SiO3(OH) (Q3 unit),51 and SiO4 (Q4 unit),39,47 respectively. The ratio
of the Q3 unit decreased as the temperature increased from
the condensation of Si–OH groups. The signals of Si–CH3 groups decreased when a sample was calcined at 700 °C
and almost disappeared at 800 °C. In the same temperature range,
however, the signals of T units increased.

Figure 5 Solid-state 29Si MAS-NMR spectra for both uncalcined
and calcined SiOC gels (500–800 °C, N2 atmosphere).

The peak areas of the ratios for
DTMDSO and T units
at each heat-treated temperature are summarized in Table 1. Gaussian distribution fitting
was used to conduct the deconvolution in each peak. The peak area
ratio of DTMDSO units was defined as DTMDSO/(Q
+ T + DTMDSO) in the SiOC structure, and the ratio decreased
with increase in the calcination temperature. The difference in the
peak area ratio of T units was defined as T/(Q + T + DTMDSO), and this value was small for samples calcined below 700 °C.
The peak area ratio of T units was increased, however, when a sample
was calcined at 800 °C. In their study, Babonneau et al.41 noted a similar phenomenon wherein D units (SiO2C2) in the SiOC structure derived from tetraethoxysilane
(Si(OEt)4) and diethoxydimethylsilane ((CH3)2Si(OEt)2) changed to T units, which was caused
by the cleavage and redistribution reaction of Si–C and Si–O
bonds39,52−55 during heat treatment under temperatures
that ranged from 400 to 600 °C under an argon atmosphere.

Effect of Calcination Temperatures on Microporous Structure
and Gas Permeation Properties
Figure 6 shows the N2 adsorption isotherms
at 77 K (a) and the specific surface areas as a function of calcination
temperature (500–800 °C) (b). The specific surface areas
for SiOC gels were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method for relative pressures (p/p0) ranging from 0.1 to 0.3.

Figure 6 N2 adsorption
isotherms at 77 K (closed symbols: adsorption,
open symbols: desorption) (a) and the specific surface areas calculated
using the BET method as a function of calcination temperature (b).

The adsorption isotherm of uncalcined
gel showed low nitrogen adsorption
volumes and resembled a type II isotherm. The introduction of TMDSO
into the networks could have acted as a “large pendant”
unit, which could have blocked micropore access by N2,
which would suggest nonporous properties. The SiOC gel samples calcined
above 500 °C, however, showed highly adsorbed volumes at low
relative pressures and large increases in the specific surface areas.
The volume of adsorbed N2 for the SiOC sample calcined
at 500 °C continued to increase in relative pressures that ranged
from 0.1 to 1.0, suggesting the presence of mesopores in its structure.

The SiOC gel calcined above 600 °C, however, showed a type
I adsorption isotherm, which indicated the formation of fewer mesopores. Table 2 summarizes the pore
volume of uncalcined and calcined SiOC gels (500–800 °C,
N2 atmosphere) via the micropore (MP) analysis and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) methods. Mesopore volume using the BJH method clearly decreased
as heat treatment temperatures increased from 500 to 600 °C.
This was likely caused by the crosslinking reaction of Si–CH3 groups in TMDSO, which would have resulted in a decrease
in the formation of mesopores. There was no large difference in micropore
volume using the MP method for SiOC gels calcined at 500–700
°C, and a SiOC gel calcined at 800 °C showed the smallest
pore volume. This was likely caused by a densification of the SiOC
structure that resulted from a redistribution of the Si–C and
Si–O bonds.39,52−55

Figure 7 shows the
gas permeance at 200 °C as a function of the molecular size for
SiOC membranes calcined at 500–800 °C under a N2 atmosphere. A SiOC membrane calcined at 500–700 °C showed
approximately the same levels of permeance for He, H2,
CO2, and N2, irrespective of the calcination
temperature. For example, a SiOC membrane calcined at 500 °C
showed high H2 permeance of 8.9 × 10–7 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1 with H2/N2, H2/CF4,
H2/SF6 selectivities of 5.9, 240, and 1400,
respectively. Figure S1 shows the temperature
dependence of gas permeance for a SiOC membrane calcined at 500 °C
under a N2 atmosphere. The permeances of He and H2 were approximately independent of temperature, and N2, CH4, CF4, and SF6 molecules showed
the Knudsen-type permeation behavior; permeance slightly increased
with decreasing temperature. The permeance of CO2 increased
with decreasing temperature, which is a surface diffusion mechanism,
since CO2 molecules are adsorptive and have a strong affinity
with the SiOC structure.24 Gas selectivity
for small molecules (H2/N2 selectivity: 5.9)
was controlled by the Knudsen diffusion through network pores and
for large molecules (H2/CF4: 240, H2/SF6: 1400) by molecular sieving.

Figure 7 Molecular size dependence
of gas permeance at 200 °C for SiOC
membranes calcined at 500–800 °C under a N2 atmosphere.

A SiOC membrane calcined
at 700 °C showed smaller values for
CH4, CF4, and SF6 permeances compared
with that calcined at 500 °C; a SiOC membrane calcined at 700
°C showed higher selectivity for large molecules (N2/CF4, 98; H2/CF4, 640; H2/SF6, 2900).

Organic crosslinking reactions of Si–CH3 groups
occurred when a membrane was heat-treated at 700 °C under a N2 atmosphere, and the formation of SiOC networks via organic
crosslinking reactions decreased the occurrence of mesopores that
CF4 and SF6 are able to permeate, which narrowed
the pore size distribution. This trend was consistent with the elimination
of mesopores in the SiOC structure via organic crosslinking reactions
based on the results of N2 adsorption property.

A
SiOC membrane calcined at 800 °C showed smaller values of
He and H2 permeances compared with that calcined at 500–700
°C, which demonstrated that He permeance was higher than that
of H2. A SiOC membrane calcined at 800 °C showed H2/N2 selectivity of 62, which was approximately
10 times higher than that calcined at 700 °C due to the densification
of SiOC networks.

Figure 8 shows a
schematic image of the formation of a SiOC network and the effect
of calcination temperature on a SiOC network. First, TMDSO was introduced
into the SQ networks via the hydrosilylation of Si–H and Si–C=C
groups. No significant change was noted in the chemical structure
of the SiOC network, however, before heat treatment at 500 °C.
Then, when heat treatment reached 600–700 °C, a crosslinking
of Si–CH3 groups occurred, which is known to prevent
the formation of mesopores based on the results of N2 adsorption
and gas permeation properties. At higher temperatures (>800 °C),
a free-carbon phase was formed by the partial decomposition of organic
groups,38,44 and the SiOC structure began to densify,
which likely was a result of the cleavage and redistribution reactions
of the Si–C and Si–O groups.39,52−55

Evaluating the Oxidative Stability and Structure of an SiOC
Membrane
Figure 9 shows the time courses of single-gas permeance and gas selectivities
(He/N2 and N2/CF4) for the SiOC membrane
calcined at 700 °C during exposure to air at 500 °C. Molecular
size dependence on gas permeance at 200 °C before/after air treatment
(500 °C, 15 h) is shown in Figure 10. Although the value of each permeance gradually
increased in the initial stages of exposure to air, each permeance
reached a steady state after exposure to air for 15 h. Air-treated
SiOC membranes showed high selectivity for large molecules. For example,
the permeance of N2 increased slightly from 8.9 ×
10–8 to 1.1 × 10–7 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1 with
a slight decrease in N2/CF4 selectivity from
66 to 49, confirming the oxidative stability of the SiOC structure
for the separation of large molecules.

Figure 9 Time course of single-gas
permeance and gas selectivities (He/N2 and N2/CF4) at 500 °C for a SiOC
membrane calcined at 700 °C during exposure to air at 500 °C.

Figure 10 Molecular size dependence of gas permeance
at 200 °C for a
SiOC membrane calcined at 700 °C before/after air treatment (500
°C, 15 h).

Following air treatment,
SiOC membranes showed a trend whereby
the values for permeance of gas with a large molecular size increased
significantly compared with gases of smaller molecular size. This
is because large molecules, such as CF4 and SF6, could only permeate large pores (few grain boundaries) in the membranes
before air treatment. As described in Experimental
Section, in the present study, an amorphous SiOC layer was
fabricated on the SiO2–ZrO2 intermediate
layer with a pore size distribution in the range of 1–5 nm.56 Thus, SQ sol cannot completely cover large pores
in the intermediate layer, resulting in the formation of a few large
spaces with pore sizes larger than 0.6 nm (grain boundaries), where
CF4 and SF6 can permeate via the Knudsen diffusion.

Even though SiOC networks were quite stable against an oxidative
atmosphere, the partial oxidation of Si–CH3 groups
enlarged the SiOC network, which could have decreased the level of
molecular sieving for larger molecules. Small molecules, such as He
and H2, easily permeate loose SiOC networks, irrespective
of air treatment, so that the ratio of He and H2 permeance
was less affected by air treatment.

Figure 11 shows
the solid-state 29Si MAS-NMR spectra of a SiOC gel calcined
at 700 °C before/after air treatment at 500 °C under N2. The decrease in D units could have been caused by the oxidation
of Si–CH3 to SiO2, which would be consistent
with the increased gas permeance during the initial stage of exposure
to air. On the other hand, there were no large changes in T units
even after air treatment, which indicates the oxidative stability
of the resultant SiOC structure. The peak ratios of D units (DTMDSO/(Q + T + DTMDSO)) and T units (T/(Q + T +
DTMDSO)) were 0.07 and 0.26, respectively, and there was
no change in the T peak ratio of the SiOC gels before/after air treatment.

Conclusions
A
SiOC membrane with high oxidative stability for gas separation
was tailored by utilizing VTMS, TRIES, and TMDSO as Si precursors.
Amorphous SiOC networks were formed by the condensation of Si–OH
groups via hydrosilylation of Si–H and Si–CH=CH2 groups and by the crosslinking reaction of Si–CH3 groups. The effects of calcination temperatures on the SiOC
network structure and on the gas permeation properties of SiOC membranes
were evaluated, and the oxidative stability of SiOC membranes was
evaluated by measuring the time courses of gas permeance during air
treatments at 500 °C.

The results of N2 adsorption
and gas permeation properties
showed that the crosslinking of Si–CH3 groups at
temperatures ranging from 600 to 700 °C under a N2 atmosphere during the formation of the Si–CH2–Si
unit were quite effective in preventing the formation of mesopores.
The network pore sizes in SiOC membranes calcined at 700 °C were
appropriate for the separation of large molecules (H2/CF4 selectivity: 640, H2/SF6: 2900, N2/CF4: 98). A SiOC membrane calcined at 800 °C
showed H2/N2 selectivity of 62, which was approximately
10 times higher than that calcined at 700 °C because of the densification
of SiOC networks caused by the cleavage and redistribution reactions
of Si–C and Si–O groups.

A SiOC membrane calcined
at 700 °C showed oxidative stability
at 500 °C because the differences were insignificant for molecular
sieving properties before/after air treatment at 500 °C for 15
h. Each permeance value gradually increased during the initial stages
of exposure to air, but a steady state was reached after exposure
to air for 15 h.

Experimental Section
Preparation of the SiOC
Sol and Membranes
The SiOC
sol was prepared via the following process. First, SQ networks were
formed by subjecting VTMS and TRIES to hydrolysis and polymerization
reactions via the sol–gel method. VTMS and TRIES were dissolved
in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and hydrolyzed with water and HCl diluted
by IPA and then stirred for 1 h at 50 °C. Then, TMDSO was introduced
into the SQ networks via hydrosilylation at 25 °C for 1 h using
a mixture of hydrogen hexachloroplatinate(IV) hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) as a catalyst. The molar ratio
of the Si precursors and the mixture was VTMS/TRIES/TMDSO = 1:3:1
and Si/H2O/HCl/Pt = 1:120:0.1:1.6 × 10–3, with the Si precursor maintained at 3.0 wt %.

SiOC membranes
were fabricated using porous α-alumina tubes (porosity, 50%;
average pore size, 1 μm; outside diameter, 10 mm; tube length,
100 mm, Nikkato, Co., Japan). First, an α-alumina particle layer
was fabricated by coating two types of α-alumina particles (large
particles, 2.7 μm; small particles, 0.2 μm) with SiO2–ZrO2 (Si/Zr = 1:1) colloidal sols as a
binder to smooth the surface of the porous α-alumina tubes.
The intermediate layer was then fabricated by coating SiO2–ZrO2 (Si/Zr = 1:1) colloidal sols onto the α-alumina
layer with calcination at 500–800 °C under an air atmosphere
for 10 min. Finally, to promote gas separation, the top layer amounted
to a coating of the SiOC sol followed by calcination at 500–800
°C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Characterization
of SiOC Films and Gels
Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) measurement of the SiOC films coated onto a silicon
wafer was conducted at room temperature using a FT-IR spectrometer
(FT/IR-4100, Jasco, Co., Japan). SiOC gel powders were prepared by
drying at 40 °C under an air atmosphere and were calcined at
500–800 °C under nitrogen for 1 h. Thermogravimetric-mass
spectrometric (TG-MS) analysis was performed via TG-MS (TG-DTA-410S,
Rigaku Co., Japan) under a helium atmosphere, and the temperature
was ramped up at a rate of 10 °C min–1 to a
level of 1000 °C. Before TG analysis, the sample was maintained
at 150 °C under a helium atmosphere at a flow rate of 300 mL
min–1 for 2 h to remove the adsorbed water. The
N2 adsorption isotherms for SiOC gels were measured at
77 K using a BELMAX (BELL Co., Japan). Prior to N2 adsorption
measurement, the uncalcined SiOC gel was pretreated at 100 °C
under vacuum for 24 h, and SiOC gels calcined at 500–800 °C
were pretreated at 200 °C under vacuum for 12 h.

Solid-state 13C CP MAS-NMR, and 29Si MAS-NMR were recorded using
a NMR spectrometer (Varian 600PS, Agilent Inc.). 13C CP
MAS-NMR measurements were conducted at 150.9 MHz using 13C–1H dipolar couplings. The spectra were acquired
with a 90° pulse of 3.2 μs with the recycle delay set at
70 s for 360 scans. The peak position was referenced to the signal
of hexamethylbenzene. A 6 mm diameter zirconia rotor contained gel
samples that were spun at 7 kHz.

29Si MAS-NMR measurements
were conducted at 119.2 MHz
with the recycle delay set at 70 s for 400 scans. The peak position
was chosen in reference to the signal of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt. The 29Si NMR spectra were also
obtained using a 6 mm diameter zirconia rotor spun at 7 kHz.

Single-Gas
Permeation Measurement and Testing for Oxidation
Stability
Single-gas permeation (50–500 °C) and
oxidative stability measurements of SiOC membranes were performed
using the experimental apparatus shown in Figure 12. High-pure, single-probe gases (He, H2, CO2, N2, CH4, CF4, and SF6) were fed to the outside (upstream) of the membrane
at atmospheric pressure, and the permeate side (downstream) was evacuated
using a vacuum pump. Each permeance value was calculated using the
observed pressure difference between the upstream and downstream values
of the membrane, and the permeation rate was obtained via a calibrated
critical nozzle located between the permeation cell and a vacuum pump.24

Figure 12 Schematic diagram of the single-gas permeation measurement
and
oxidative stability testing.

The oxidative stability of the SiOC membrane was evaluated
by measuring
the time course of gas permeance (He, N2, CH4, and CF4) at 500 °C during air treatment. The air
treatment was conducted at 500 °C by feeding air into the membrane
module for a specified time interval, and the changes were noted for
each level of permeance during the air treatment.
