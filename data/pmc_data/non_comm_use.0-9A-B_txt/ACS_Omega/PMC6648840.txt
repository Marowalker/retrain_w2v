We report a facile method for the
synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles
(nZnOs) by rapidly heating a paste of zinc nitrate and sucrose on
the hot plate at 500 °C. The transmission electron microscopy
images revealed the spherical shape of the nZnO with an average size
of 35 nm. The band gap and the specific surface area of the nZnO were
measured to be about 3.32 eV and 80.11 m2/g, respectively.
The nZnO was utilized for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl
orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) in water under the ultraviolet
(UV-B) light and sunlight irradiation. Photocatalysis was performed
in two types of water matrices, viz., the deionized water and the
simulated fresh drinking water. Almost a complete degradation of MO
and MB was obtained within 30 min of UV-B light irradiation. Under
sunlight irradiation, more than 95% of the MO solution underwent degradation
within 30 min. The photocatalytic stability of the nZnO was examined
for five cycles, and a similar activity was found throughout the cycles.
The photocatalytic generation of the hydroxyl radical (•OH) was confirmed by the terephthalic acid photoluminescence tests.
Moreover, the synthesis methodology was validated by triplicating
the nZnO synthesis. Every time, the nZnO demonstrated a similar photocatalytic
activity, which confirmed the robustness of the synthesis procedure.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is one
of the most extensively studied semiconductor-type
metal oxides.1 As a semiconductor material,
ZnO has wide-band gap of 3.37 eV and an exciton binding energy of
60 meV.2 In addition to the semiconductor
property, ZnO has intriguing piezoelectric,3 oxidizing,4 and antibacterial properties.5−7 Moreover, because of the cheaper price, abundance, and high chemical,
as well as physical robustness, ZnO is widely used in a number of
applications. For example, ZnO is used in transparent electrodes of
the dye-sensitized solar cells,8 piezoelectric
nanogenerators,9 sensing,10 as fillers in numerous products,11 ultraviolet (UV) light absorbers in personal care products,12 light-emitting diodes,13 UV photodetectors,14 and photocatalysis.15−18 As a photocatalyst, ZnO and its nanocomposites demonstrate excellent
ability toward the degradation of organic pollutants in water under
the UV light illumination.19−23 Organic pollutants undergo degradation on the ZnO surface through
the redox processes driven by the electronic excitation between valence
and conduction bands (CBs).24 Also, ZnO
has the ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the
UV light irradiation, which can degrade organic pollutants and inactivate
or inhibit microorganisms in water.

Recently, the photocatalytic
degradation of organic pollutants
has drawn tremendous attention because of its advantages over other
methods, viz., adsorption, precipitation, filtration, coagulation,
biological treatment, and so forth.25 For
instance, photocatalytic processes usually do not require chemicals
and do not produce any secondary pollutants; photocatalytic processes
have the ability to degrade hazardous organic pollutants to mineralization,
whereas most of the other techniques transfer pollutants from one
place to another.26 Moreover, the photocatalyst
can be used for multiple cycles without the loss of the activity.
As ZnO demonstrates excellent photocatalytic activity, it could potentially
be used as an efficient and viable photocatalyst for the degradation
of organic pollutants in water. However, the photocatalytic activity
of ZnO is obtained when the particles are in the nanoscopic size range
(1–100 nm) in contrast to the macroscopic or bulk size. Therefore,
there is a need for the synthesis of high-quality zinc oxide nanoparticles
(nZnOs) via a facile method that avoids the use of harsh chemicals
and rigorous experimental procedures.

Various chemical and physical
methods have been reported for the
synthesis of nZnO thus far.27 Some of the
commonly employed methods include the sol–gel,28,29 combustion,30,31 hydro/solvothermal,32−35 laser ablation,36 chemical vapor deposition,37 microemulsion techniques,38 and the microwave-assisted synthesis.39 In addition, there are physical top-down techniques, such
as mechanical or mechanochemical milling, where the bulk ZnO is converted
into nZnO.40 A large number of methods
for the synthesis of nZnO require expensive and hazardous substrates,
rigorous experimental conditions, tedious techniques, and sophisticated
instruments. Moreover, sometimes, the nZnOs are not efficient enough
for the desired photocatalytic applications. Therefore, it is important
to develop a simple, fast, and low-cost method for the synthesis of
high-quality and photocatalytically active nZnO. Recently, the combustion
synthesis has become a very popular and effective technique to synthesize
metal oxide nanoparticles because of the versatility, simplicity,
and rapidity of the process.41 In combustion
synthesis, a mixture of metal salt as an oxidizer (e.g., metal nitrates)
and fuels (e.g., urea, glycine, and hydrazides) is heated to a high
temperature. When heated to a temperature, the mixture undergoes a
self-sustained reaction to produce uniform metal oxide nanoparticles
while burning away the fuel in the form of CO2, H2O, and other gases. Utilizing the combustion synthesis technique,
many types of single and mixed metal oxide nanoparticles have been
prepared.42,43 For the synthesis of nZnO, different types
of organic compounds and plant extracts have been used as fuels.44 However, there are some drawbacks of these methods.
For example, the plant extracts containing metallic and nonmetallic
impurities can modify the desired properties of the nZnO by doping
it with the metallic and nonmetallic elements. Also, the utilization
of plant extracts for the large-scale synthesis of engineered nanoparticles
may not be a viable method, and it is still under questions.45 Other organic compounds, such as urea and thiourea,
usually make nZnO doped with nitrogen and sulfur, which may be undesired
and can alter the desired catalytic property of the nZnO. Therefore,
for the preparation of high-quality nZnO through the combustion synthesis
method, a highly pure and cheap fuel is necessary. In this regard,
sucrose could potentially be used as a fuel because of its low price
and availability in the form of high purity. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no report for the synthesis of nZnO utilizing sucrose as
the fuel in the combustion synthesis. Additionally, there is no report
for the synthesis of nZnO that can be completely performed using a
hot plate within 30 min period of time.

Herein, we report a
simple and fast method for the synthesis of
nZnO by rapidly heating a paste of zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O] and sucrose (C12H22O11) at 500 °C on the hot plate. The
as-synthesized nZnO was thoroughly characterized by the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray powder diffraction
spectroscopy (XRPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–visible
absorption spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR). The nZnO demonstrated very good performance toward the photocatalytic
degradation organic pollutants, viz., methyl orange (MO) and methylene
blue (MB), in water under the UV-B light and sunlight irradiation.
The photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radical (•OH) was confirmed through the terephthalic acid (TA) photoluminescence
(PL) tests. The reproducibility of the synthesis method and the stability
of the nZnO were also studied to evaluate the potential application
of the nZnO for the photocatalytic water treatment.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Unless
otherwise mentioned,
all chemicals were used as received. Sucrose (C12H22O11 > 99.5%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O ≥ 98%], sodium hydroxide
(NaOH ≥ 98%), and TA [C8H6O4 = 98%] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MO (C14H15N3O3S > 98.0%) and MB (C16H18ClN3S > 98%) were obtained from TCI America
and Consolidated Chemical, respectively. A Fisher Scientific 11-600-49sh
Isotemp Analog Hot Plate Stirrer was used as the heating source for
the synthesis of nZnO. Throughout the nZnO synthesis period, the hot
plate was preheated to its highest capacity and the hot plate surface
temperature was measured to be about 500 °C. An UV box reactor
(UVP Ultraviolet Cross-linker, model CL-1000), having UV-B fluorescent
tube lamps, was used for the photocatalytic degradation of MO and
MB. The UV reactor shined the light from the top only. The intensity
of light on the surface of the reaction was measured to be 21 500
lux. The intensity of light was measured by using a digital Light
Meter LX1330B. The UV-B lamp generated light of 302 nm wavelength,
as specified by the vendor of the lamp. Syringe filters with polypropylene
housing and PTFE membrane material with 0.45 μm pore size were
obtained from VWR, which were used to filter the reaction mixture.
Milli-Q water (>18.20 MΩ cm resistivity) was obtained from
the
Milli-Q (Advantage A-10) water filter system. The simulated fresh
drinking water (FDW) was prepared following the Nanotechnology Enabled
Water Treatment (NEWT) protocol. In detail, 252 mg/L NaHCO3, 147 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 124 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 95 mg/L Na2SiO3·9H2O, 12 mg/L NaNO3, 2.2 mg/L NaF, and
0.18 mg/L NaH2PO4·H2O were dissolved
in the deionized water (DIW) to achieve the simulated FDW.

2.2 Characterization Techniques
UV–vis
spectra were obtained by using an Agilent Cary 50 Conc UV–visible
spectrophotometer. A quartz cuvette of 10 mm path length was used
as the sample holder for the UV–vis studies. Solid-state UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy of the nZnO thin film was carried out with
the aid of the same UV–visible spectrophotometer. A thin film
of nZnO was formed on the microscopic glass slide to obtain the solid-state
UV–vis spectra. A paste of nZnO was prepared in ethanol using
liquid hand soap as the surfactant. A thin film of nZnO was formed
on a glass slide by the doctor blading technique. The wet thin film
on the glass slide was then heated on a hot plate at 500 °C for
about 30 min to burn off the surfactant and any other organic impurities.
Afterward, the hot plate was turned off to cool it down under the
ambient conditions. For the UV–vis spectra of the nZnO suspension,
a suspension of nZnO in ethanol (0.125 mg nZnO/mL) was prepared by
bath sonication. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and HRTEM
experiments were performed using a Hitachi H-7650 and JEOL JEM3200FS
microscope, respectively. Acceleration voltages of 80 and 300 kV were
used for the Hitachi H-7650 and JEOL JEM3200FS microscope, respectively.
Carbon-filmed copper grids with 200 mesh (Electron Microscopy Sciences)
were used for TEM imaging. For the TEM imaging, a suspension of the
nZnO in ethanol (0.125 mg nZnO/mL) was prepared by bath sonication
and a drop of this suspension was deposited onto the grid and air-dried
before imaging. SEM image and the EDX experiments were carried out
using a Hitachi S-3400N Type II scanning electron microscope (SEM)
equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. A carbon tape
was used as the substrate for the SEM imaging. The XRPD spectrum was
obtained by using a Bruker D8 DISCOVER X-ray diffractometer with Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). A Micromeritics ASAP 2020
surface area and porosity analyzer was used for the nitrogen adsorption
isotherms and to obtain the specific surface area of the nZnO.

2.3 Synthesis of nZnO
A Fisher Scientific
11-600-49sh Isotemp Analog Hot Plate Stirrer was used as the heating
source for the synthesis of nZnO. Throughout the nZnO synthesis period,
the hot plate was preheated to its highest capacity. Although the
hot plate was heated to its highest capacity, the temperature was
measured to be about 500 °C at the surface of the hot plate.
In detail, in a 150 mL glass beaker (Kimax), 1200 mg (3.51 mmol) of
sucrose and 3569.88 mg (12 mmol) of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O salt were mixed with 3 mL of DIW. The beaker
was put on the preheated hot plate. Within 1–2 min, the mixture
turned into a viscous solution and immediately after the viscous solution
started to decompose generating brownish yellow gases. After 3–4
min, a blackish brown foam was obtained from the decomposition of
zinc nitrate salt. Because the decomposition of zinc nitrate salt
formed NO2 and NOx gases, the
hot plate was placed in a fume hood with proper ventilation. Afterward,
the blackish brown hot foam/powder was transferred from the beaker
to the same bare hot plate. The powder was stirred by a spatula. While
heating at this high temperature in air, the blackish powder turned
into yellowish-white powder of nZnO. The carbon in the powder combusted
away in the form of carbon dioxide. After 20 min of heating on the
hot plate, the nZnO powder was allowed to cool down. For cooling,
the hot plate was turned off and normal ambient cooling was utilized.
The amount of nZnO obtained was about 810 mg, which was stored under
ambient condition for the characterization as well as the photocatalytic
applications.

2.4 MO and MB Photodegradation
Experiment
Photocatalytic degradation of MO and MB was carried
out in a glass
beaker (Pyrex) with 150 mL of capacity and dimensions of diameter
× height = 28 mm × 98 mm. MO and MB solutions having the
concentrations of 3 and 6 ppm (mg/L) were used for the photocatalytic
experiments, respectively. In the photodegradation experiments, 25
mg of the catalyst was homogeneously dispersed in 25 mL of MO or MB
solution by 10 min of bath sonication in dark. The bath sonication
facilitated the homogeneous dispersion of the nZnO as well as helped
in the establishment of the adsorption–desorption equilibrium
between the nZnO and the dye. The mixture was illuminated under the
UV-lamps in the box reactor while stirring the mixture. At a regular
interval of 5 min, 1 mL of the sample was withdrawn and filtered through
a syringe filter for UV–vis spectroscopic analysis. The characteristic
absorption maxima of MO and MB centered at 464 nm and 665 were used
for the calculation of percent degradation, respectively. Same experimental
conditions were utilized for the photocatalysis of MO under the sunlight
illumination. Direct sunlight was utilized for the photocatalysis
of MO in deionized and FDW matrices. For the cyclic stability experiments,
the catalyst used in the first cycle was centrifuged and used in the
same way for the subsequent cycles for the degradation of MO. The
sample was taken from the centrifuged (4000 rpm, 5 min) supernatant
so as to minimize the loss of the catalyst.

2.5 TA PL
Test for the Detection of Hydroxyl Radicals
The detail experimental
procedure was similar to that of the photocatalytic
MO or MB degradation tests. In this case, 25 mL of 5 × 10–3 M sodium terephthalate solution was used instead
of the MO or MB solution. A stock solution of 5 × 10–3 M sodium terephthalate was prepared by the reaction of a required
amount of TA with stoichiometric amount of NaOH in water. In every
5 min, 1 mL of the sample was withdrawn and filtered through the syringe
filter. The fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out on the filtrate
with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm to determine the fluorescence
emission intensity of hydroxy terephthalate at 425 nm.

3 Results and Discussion
Because of the versatile applications
of nZnO, there is a need
for the synthesis of high-quality nZnO employing a simple and fast
method. This report demonstrates a fast method for the preparation
of photocatalytically active nZnO by rapidly heating a paste of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and sucrose at 500 °C
on the hot plate (Figure 1). On the basis of the previous studies, the proposed mechanism
for the formation of nZnO can be explained as follows:46 while heating on the hot plate, the mixture
of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and sucrose
dissolves and becomes concentrated to form a uniform viscous paste
(Figure 1a). While
further heating, the Zn(NO3)2·6H2O starts to decompose rapidly to form NO2 (brownish gas),
N2, CO2, H2O, and other nitrogenous
gases, which blow the melted viscous paste and cause it to swell to
form the blackish brown color foam (Figure 1b). Meanwhile, the sucrose undergoes partial
carbonization through the dehydration and polymerization. The resulting
foam-like composite is considered to contain nZnO embedded in a partially
carbonized sucrose foam, eq 1.37 1   2  

Figure 1 Scheme
showing different stages for the synthesis of nZnO. (a)
Viscous mixture of zinc nitrate and sucrose; (b) zinc nitrate decomposition
into a foam-like structure of ZnO decomposed sucrose; (c,d) further
heating of the foam at the hot plate to burn away the carbon; (d,e)
pure nZnO when hot and after cooling; and (f) nZnO in a vial and a
typical TEM image of the nZnO.

Further heating of this partially carbonized foam with the
embedded
nZnO at elevated temperature causes the oxidation of the carbon to
CO2 leaving nZnO (eq 2, Figure 1c–e).
It was observed that the nZnO looked yellowish white (Figure 1d) in color when hot and it
turned to white when cooled down to room temperature (Figure 1e). Because of the oxygen vacancies
in the ZnO crystal, when hot, it appears the color yellowish white
and when cooled down to the room temperature, it appears white color
because of the filling up of the oxygen vacancy. The advantage of
the method is that the experimental conditions are simple, fast, and
scalable. Moreover, the methodology does not require any expensive
or hazardous reagents. The method can potentially be adapted to prepare
a wide variety of other metal and mixed oxide nanoparticles.

The rapid industrialization and increasing population growth are
posing a continual threat to the environment by polluting the air,
water, and soil with numerous organic and inorganic contaminants.
In regard to the aquatic environment, freshwater sources are being
contaminated with numerous organic pollutants that are reported to
be toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic to human beings and aquatic
organisms. As a result, freshwater is not only becoming increasingly
scarce but also hazardous to human health almost everywhere in the
world. The utilization of nZnO for the photocatalytic degradation
of organic pollutants in water could be considered as a viable and
sustainable method for the purpose of water treatment. Therefore,
a facile synthesis method of nZnO, as reported in this study, could
accelerate the overall photocatalytic water treatment processes.

3.1 TEM and HRTEM Images of the nZnO
TEM images were obtained
to visualize the size, shape, and the dispersity
of the as-synthesized nZnO. The TEM images (Figure 2b,c) revealed that the nZnOs are predominantly
spherical in shape and highly monodisperse with the smooth surface.
It could be observed that the nZnO tended to aggregate, which could
be attributed to the high surface area of nZnO.47 The size distribution histogram, obtained by measuring
the size of more than 100 randomly picked nanoparticles by the ImageJ
software, demonstrated that the nZnOs have an average size of about
35 nm (Figure 2d).
Although the size of the nZnO varied from 15 to 55 nm, the majority
of the particles was in the size range of 32–40 nm. A digital
photograph of the nZnO is shown in Figure 2a.

vial; (b,c) TEM images
of nZnO with varying magnifications; (d) size distribution of the
nZnO based on the TEM image; (e) HRTEM image of the nZnO showing the
crystalline structure of the (100) lattice plane; and (f) FFT image
of the nZnO obtained from the HRTEM image.

The crystalline nature of the nZnO was further analyzed by
the
HRTEM (Figure 2e).
Clear lattice fringes can be seen, which indicates the highly crystalline
structure of the nZnO. The interplanar spacing of 2.8 Å further
corresponds to the (100) lattice plane of the nZnO.48 The crystalline nature of the nZnO surface was also characterized
by the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analysis obtained from the
HRTEM image of the nZnO (Figure 2f). The FFT analysis not only confirmed a good crystallinity
but also determined the hexagonal wurtzite-type crystalline structure
of the nZnO.49,50

3.2 SEM Image
and the EDX Spectrum of the nZnO
The morphology and the elemental
composition of the as-prepared
nZnO were further studied by the SEM image and EDX spectrum (Figure 3), respectively.
As shown in Figure 3a, the nZnO particles were seen to be aggregated with powder-like
morphology. A porous morphology of the nZnO was also found from the
SEM image.

Figure 3 (a) Typical SEM image of the nZnO, (b) EDX spectra of the nZnO
showing the elemental composition, and (c) SEM backscattered electron
image of the nZnO and the zinc and oxygen X-ray EDS mapping.

To determine the qualitative information
of the nZnO, the EDX spectrum
was obtained (Figure 3b). The EDX spectrum generated strong peaks corresponding to zinc
and oxygen, indicating a high purity of the as-synthesized nZnO. A
small peak corresponding to carbon originated from the carbon tape
that was used as the substrate for the analysis. The SEM backscattered
electron image of the nZnO and the X-ray EDS elemental mapping image
of the nZnO are shown in Figure 3c. As the EDS spectral analysis, the EDS elemental
mapping image showed the presence and abundance of zinc and oxygen
in the nZnO sample. This further confirmed the purity of the nZnO
that was synthesized in this report.

3.3 XRPD
Pattern and the BET Surface Area of the
nZnO
The XRPD spectrum was obtained to determine the crystalline
properties as well as the crystallite particle size of the nZnO. As
shown in Figure 4,
the diffraction pattern and the sharp peaks clearly indicate the crystalline
nature of the as-prepared nZnO. Moreover, the diffraction peaks at
2θ = 31.66°, 34.20°, 36.10°, 47.36°, 56.47°,
62.63°, 66.20°, 67.81°, 68.99°, 72.40°, and
76.90° are characteristic to the (100), (002), (101), (102),
(110), (103), (200), (112), (201), (004), and 202 lattice planes of
the nZnO, respectively.51,52 This type of XRPD pattern
is characteristic to the polycrystalline hexagonal wurtzite crystal
structure of the nZnO (zincite, JCPDS 5-0664).53 From the XRPD pattern, it could be observed that the intensity
of the ZnO (101) diffraction peak is somewhat stronger than the other
peaks. This indicates that the nZnOs have a preferential orientation
toward (101) crystallographic direction.54 The absence of any other undesired peaks in the XRPD pattern indicates
the high purity of the nZnO, which is also confirmed by the EDX elemental
analysis.55

Figure 4 XRPD patterns showing
the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure
of the nZnO.

The average crystallite
size of nZnO was further calculated by
utilizing the Debye–Scherrer’s formula (eq 3) from the XRD peak width of (101).56 3  where d is the crystallite
size, k is the shape factor (0.9), λ is the
wavelength of Cu Kα X-ray radiation (1.54 Å), θ is
the Bragg diffraction angle, and β is the full width at half-maximum
of the respective diffraction peak. Applying the Debye–Scherrer
formula, the average crystallite size of the nZnO was found to be
28.9 nm. The crystallite size, obtained from the XRPD analysis, was
found to have somewhat deviated from the average particle size measured
by the TEM analysis. The crystallite size, measured from the XRPD
analysis, is assumed to be the size of a coherently diffracting domain,
and it is not necessarily the same as the particle size determined
from the TEM images.

The nZnO was further characterized by the
nitrogen gas adsorption
studies to obtain the specific surface area, pore size, and the pore
volume. The BET specific surface area of the nZnO was measured to
be about 80.11 m2/g, which is comparable or higher than
the reported values.57,58 Additionally, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
pore volume and pore diameter of the nZnO were measured to be about
0.098 cm3/g and 54.48 Å, respectively.

3.4 UV–Visible and FTIR Spectrum of the
nZnO
The UV–vis spectrum of the nZnO suspension in
ethanol (0.125 mg/mL) and the nZnO thin film on the glass substrate
is shown in Figure 5a. The nZnO in suspension and in the form of thin film generated
similar UV–vis absorption spectrum. In both cases, a sharp
absorption band centered at 375 nm was obtained. The absorption band
at 375 nm is characteristic to the intrinsic band gap absorption of
the nZnO because of the excitation of electrons from the valence band
to the CB (O 2p → Zn 3d).59 On the
basis of the absorption band at 375 nm, the band gap energy was calculated
according to eq 4. 4  where E is the energy (J), h is Planck’s
constant (h = 6.626
× 10–34 J s), c is the speed
of light (2.998 × 108 m s–1), and
λ is the wavelength of the maximum absorption (375 nm).60,61

Figure 5 (a)
UV–visible absorption spectra of the nZnO thin film
and nZnO suspension in ethanol and (b) FTIR spectrum of the nZnO.

A band gap energy of 3.32 eV was
obtained for the nZnO, which is
similar to the band gap energy of the zinc oxide reported elsewhere.62,63 Moreover, Figure 5a shows that there are significant absorptions in the visible range
and an absorption tail reaching to 800 nm. The origin of this absorption
and tail could be assigned to the scattering of the light by nZnO
in colloidal suspension or in the thin film. Therefore, from the UV–vis
spectrum, it is confirmed that the nZnO has a high absorption coefficient
in the UV region (<400 nm) of the electromagnetic radiation.

The FTIR spectra of the nZnO are shown in Figure 5b. A strong peak at 415 cm–1 was observed, which is characteristic to the Zn–O stretching
vibrational mode of the hexagonal ZnO nanoparticles.60,64 This further confirms the formation of ZnO nanoparticles by this
method. A less intense peak at ∼3400 cm–1 can be attributed to the O–H stretching vibrations originated
from the chemically bound OH group or the adsorbed moisture on the
nZnO surface.

3.5 High-Resolution XPS Analysis
of the nZnO
The elemental composition and the purity of the
nZnO were characterized
by the XPS analysis. From the XPS survey spectrum, it was found that
the nZnO was mainly consisting of Zn and O while having a trace of
C (Figure 6a). Binding
energies characteristic to the ZnO, Zn (2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d), Zn LMM,
Zn LMN, O KLL, and O 1s, were observed in the XPS spectrum.65,66 The carbon peak may have originated from the adventitious contamination
of the XPS instrument.54

Figure 6 (a) XPS survey spectrum
of the nZnO, and high-resolution XPS spectrum
of the (b) Zn 2p, (c) O 1s, and (d) Zn 3p electrons.

The Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks at 1022.5
and 1045.6 eV can be assigned to Zn element in ZnO, respectively.54−56 The Zn 3p3/2 and Zn 3p1/2 binding energy of
the nZnO sample can be attributed to the peaks at 88.1 and 91.1 eV,
respectively.67 The binding energy of O
1s can be attributed to the peak at about 531 eV.54,55 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s can be resolved into two
peaks at 531.2 and 532.8 eV, which are characteristic to the Zn–O
and the OH on the surface of ZnO, respectively.68 The OH group may have originated from the breaking of Zn–O–Zn
bond and the formation of Zn–OH bond, during the high-temperature
synthesis under the ambient conditions. Therefore, from the XRD and
XPS analyses, it could be inferred that the as-synthesized nZnO was
highly pure.

3.6 Photocatalytic Degradation
of MO and MB by
UV Light
The photocatalytic performance of the nZnO was evaluated
by the degradation of MO and MB in water under UV and sunlight illumination.
As mentioned above, the photocatalysis of MO and MB was done in DIW
and simulated FDW matrices. The time-dependent percent degradation
of MO and MB was calculated by using eq 5. The UV–visible spectroscopy was utilized to
monitor the degradation of MO and MB. 5  where Co and Ct represent the initial and
time-dependent concentrations of MO and MB, respectively and Ao and At represent the initial and time-dependent absorbance of MO
and MB, respectively.

Figure 7a shows the time-dependent UV–vis spectrum of
6 ppm MO solution in DIW during its photocatalytic degradation in
the presence of nZnO. As shown in Figure 7a, the concentration of MO gradually decreased
with respect to the time of photocatalysis. The absorption maxima
at 464 and 275 nm disappeared almost completely after 30 min of catalysis,
which suggested the degradation of MO in water.

Figure 7 (a,d) Time-dependent
UV–vis spectra of the 6 ppm MO and
MB solution during the photocatalytic degradation; (b,e) time-dependent
percent degradation of MO and MB; and (c,f) pseudo-first-order kinetics
of the photocatalytic degradation of MO and MB.

The time-dependent percent degradation of 3 and 6 ppm MO
solution
is shown in Figure 7b. It was found that the 3 ppm MO solution in DIW completely decolorized
within 15 min of photocatalysis, whereas it took about 25 min to completely
decolorize the 6 ppm MO solution in DIW. It is typical that it takes
longer time to degrade pollutants of higher concentration compared
to the lower concentration. The percent degradation of MO in FDW was
found to be little slower compared to the one in DIW. For example,
it took about 40 min to completely degrade the 6 ppm MO solution in
FDW, whereas it took about 25 min in DIW. The presence of dissolved
ions could be attributed to this slower photocatalytic activity. Also,
it was observed that the extent of MO adsorption was higher in DIW
compared to the FDW (Figure 7b). In the absence of the nZnO, the MO solution did not undergo
any decolorization under the UV light irradiation, which indicated
the robustness of MO against the photodegradation. Moreover, in the
absence of light, nZnO showed less than 10% decolorization of the
MO solution (6 ppm in DIW) after 30 min (data not shown here), which
is mainly due to adsorption. On the other hand, a complete decolorization
of MO solution (6 ppm in DIW) was observed after 30 min in the presence
of nZnO and UV light (Figure 7b), which indicated that the degradation of MO happened photocatalytically.

The time-dependent UV–vis spectra and the percent degradation
of MB are shown in Figure 7d,e, respectively. Both 3 and 6 ppm MB solution show almost
complete decolorization in about 30 min period of photocatalysis.
The MB solution, in the absence of the nZnO, did not show any degradation
under the UV light irradiation. Therefore, it confirmed that the nZnO
was responsible for the degradation of MB under the UV light irradiation.

The experimental result for the photocatalytic degradation of MO
and MB by nZnO was further analyzed by the pseudo-first-order kinetic
model. The pseudo-first-order rate equation is represented as follows 6  where k represents the rate
constant (min–1) of the reaction and Ct and Co represent
the concentration of the MO and MB at time t and
at the beginning of the reaction, respectively.

As shown in Figure 7c,f, the −ln(Ct/Co) versus the time (t) graph followed the linear
trends, which suggested that the kinetics
of the MO and MB degradation followed the pseudo-first-order reaction
mechanism. A linear relationship between −ln(Ct/Co) and
reaction time (t) further indicate that the photocatalytic
reaction followed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model.69 The apparent rate constants (kapp) of the photocatalytic degradation of MO were calculated
to be 2.49 × 10–1, 1.95 × 10–1, 2.90 × 10–1, and 1.04 × 10–1 min–1, respectively, for 3 ppm MO in DIW, 6 ppm
MO in DIW, 3 ppm MO in FDW, and 6 ppm MO in FDW solution. Likewise,
the rate constants of MB degradation were calculated to be 1.26 ×
10–1, 1.15 × 10–1, 1.23 ×
10–1, and 9.64 × 10–2 min–1, respectively, for 3 ppm MB in DIW, 6 ppm MB in DIW,
3 ppm MB in FDW, and 6 ppm MB in FDW solution.

3.7 Photocatalytic
Degradation of MO by Sunlight
The photocatalytic performance
of the nZnO was further evaluated
by the degradation of 6 ppm MO solution in DIW and FDW by the sunlight
irradiation. As shown in Figure 8a–c, the nZnO effectively degraded 6 ppm MO
solution in DIW and FDW matrices and the percent degradation reached
to almost to 100 within 30 min of sunlight irradiation. The degradation
of MO in DIW was found to be faster compared to the FDW matrix (Figure 8b,c). Also, no degradation
of MO solution was found in the absence of nZnO. The performance of
the nZnO under sunlight irradiation can be attributed to the presence
of 4–5% of UV light in solar radiation. Also, the fast-catalytic
activity under sunlight irradiation was due to the extremely high
intensity of the sunlight in compared to the UV light used in this
study. The average intensity of the UV light in the box reactor was
about 22 000 lux, whereas the sunlight had an average intensity
of about 100 000 lux.

Figure 8 (a) Time-dependent UV–vis spectrum for
the photocatalytic
degradation of 6 ppm MO in DIW under sunlight irradiation, (b) time-dependent
percent degradation of 6 ppm MO solution in DIW and FDW, and (c) pseudo-first-order
kinetics of the photocatalytic degradation of MO.

The sunlight irradiated photocatalytic degradation of MO
followed
the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics and the rate constants (kapp) was calculated to be 1.71 × 10–1 and 1.13 × 10–1 for the 6
ppm MO in DIW and 6 ppm MO in FDW, respectively.

The photocatalytic
activity of the nZnO for the degradation of
MO and MB, studied in this report, is summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 Photocatalytic
Degradation of MO and
MB by the nZnO in Different Water Matrices and in Different Types
of Light Illumination
pollutants	concentration	water matrix	light source	rate constant
(min–1)	
MO	3 ppm	DIW	UV	2.49 × 10–1	
MO	6 ppm	DIW	UV	1.95 × 10–1	
MO	3 ppm	FDW	UV	2.90 × 10–1	
MO	6 ppm	FDW	UV	1.04 × 10–1	
MB	3 ppm	DIW	UV	1.26 × 10–1	
MB	6 ppm	DIW	UV	1.15 × 10–1	
MB	3 ppm	FDW	UV	1.23 × 10–1	
MB	6 ppm	FDW	UV	9.64 × 10–2	
MO	6 ppm	DIW	sun	1.71 × 10–1	
MO	6 ppm	FDW	sun	1.13 × 10–1	
From the above photocatalysis experiments,
it could be concluded
that the as-prepared nZnO is highly active in the degradation of organic
compounds, viz., MO and MB in DIW as well as FDW matrices. Therefore,
it could be suggested that the nZnO could effectively be used for
the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds in water by the
use of both the UV and the sunlight.

3.8 Cyclic
Stability of the nZnO and the Validity
of the Method To Prepare nZnO
The cyclic stability of the
nZnO was determined by conducting the photocatalytic degradation of
MO for 5 cycles over a period of 2 weeks. A mixture of 25 mL of MO
solution (6 ppm) and 25 mg of nZnO was irradiated for 30 min under
UV light. Afterward, the mixture was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10
min to obtain the clear supernatant, which was analyzed by UV–vis
spectroscopy to determine the percent degradation of MO. The centrifuged
nZnO was used similarly for the following cycles. Figure 9a shows the photocatalytic
activity of the nZnO for 5 cycles. The results reveal that the nZnO
is fairly active throughout the cycles over the period of study. In
every cycle, the nZnO degraded more than 96 percent of the MO. Therefore,
from this study, it could be suggested that the nZnO, synthesized
in this study, could potentially be utilized as a robust and long
lasting photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants from
wastewater.

Figure 9 (a) Cyclic stability of the nZnO for 5 cycles of MO degradation
and (b) photocatalytic activity of nZnO prepared in three independent
trials.

In order to validate the synthesis
methodology, the nZnO was prepared
in three independent trials that were utilized for the degradation
of 6 ppm MO solution in DIW. As can be seen from Figure 9b, the nZnO prepared in all
three trials has the similar activity for the degradation of 6 ppm
MO in solution. These results further validated the robustness of
the methodology for the synthesis of nZnO.

The robustness of
the synthesis methodology was further evaluated
by preparing nZnO from zinc nitrate salts obtained from two different
vendors, viz., the Sigma-Aldrich and the Fisher Scientific. The nZnO,
prepared from the zinc nitrate salts of Sigma-Aldrich and the Fisher
Scientific, was utilized for the degradation 6 ppm MO solution in
DIW and compared (Figure 10).

Figure 10 (a) Photocatalytic activity of nZnO prepared form Zn(NO3)2·6H2O obtained from different
vendors,
viz., Sigma-Aldrich and the Fisher Scientific, and (b) comparison
of the photocatalytic activity of the nZnO with the commercial nZnO.

It was observed that the nZnO,
synthesized from the Zn(NO3)2·6H2O obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich
and the Fisher Scientific, had a similar activity for the degradation
of 6 ppm MO solution in DIW (Figure 10). Therefore, it could be concluded that a highly photocatalytically
active nZnO can be prepared, following the method mentioned in this
study, irrespective to the vendors of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. Additionally, the photocatalytic performance
of the nZnO, prepared in this study, was compared with the commercially
available nZnO obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Figure 10b). It was found that the photocatalytic
activity of the commercial nZnO was much faster compared to the nZnO.
The difference in the performance could be because of the difference
in the particle size, shape, crystallinity, and the purity of the
commercial nZnOs and the nZnO.

3.9 Determination
of the ROS Generated in the
Photocatalytic Process
The photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl
radicals (•OH) was determined by the TA PL technique.70,71 The sodium slat of TA reacts with the photocatalytically generated •OH to form 2-hydroxyterephthalate, which demonstrate
strong fluorescence emission band centered at 425 nm when excited
at a wavelength of 315 nm (Figure 11). Qualitatively, the stronger the fluorescence intensity,
the higher the amount of the •OH generation at the
interface of water and the catalyst.

Figure 11 Reaction of terephthalate with the photocatalytically
generated •OH radical to form 2-hydroxyterephthalate.

The results of the TA PL tests
are shown in Figure 12. Figure 12a shows
the time-dependent fluorescence emission spectrum
of 2-hydroxyterephthalate catalyzed by the nZnO, whereas Figure 12b shows the time-dependent
fluorescence emission spectrum of 2-hydroxyterephthalate solution
under UV light illumination (without the nZnO). For the nZnO catalyzed
reaction, it could be seen that the fluorescence emission intensity
increased at a much higher rate compared to the uncatalyzed reaction.

Figure 12 (a)
Time-dependent fluorescence spectra of the 2-hydroxyterephthalate
solution catalyzed by the nZnO; (b) time-dependent fluorescence spectra
of the 2-hydroxyterephthalate solution only (without the nZnO); and
(c) fluorescence emission intensity at 425 nm vs graph.

Figure 12c shows
the fluorescence intensity of 2-hydroxyterephthalate at 425 nm with
respect to the time of photocatalytic reaction. It can be seen that
the fluorescence intensity for the nZnO catalyzed reaction increased
very rapidly up to 10 min and afterward it became slow gradually.
The gradual slowing of the fluorescence intensity could be attributed
to the gradual decrease in the concentration of TA in the solution
and thereby limiting the reaction between the •OH
and the TA. However, at the end of 30 min, the fluorescence intensity
was still increasing. In compared to the uncatalyzed reaction, the
nZnO catalyzed reaction generated a much higher amount of •OH, which can be seen from Figure 12c. The nZnO catalyzed reaction generated about 38 times
more •OH compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. This
result is complying to the photocatalytic degradation of MO and MB
that is discussed above. Moreover, the TA fluorescence results indicate
that the nZnO can generate hydroxyl radicals under the UV-B light
illumination. The photocatalytic generated highly reactive and short-lived •OH have the ability to nonselectively degrade the organic
pollutants in water.

3.10 Proposed Mechanism for
the Photocatalytic
Degradation of Organic Pollutants
On the basis of the findings
of these studies and the results if the previous mechanistic studies,
the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds on nZnO occurs,
as shown in Figure 13. The photons of the incident light couple with the oscillating valance
band (VB) electrons in the nZnO causing the excitation of electrons
(e–) to the CB while leaving holes (h+) on the VB. These holes (h+) on the VB then oxidize organic
or inorganic species. Holes (h+) on the VB can also oxidize
the hydroxyl (OH–) ions to hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which can nonselectively and effectively degrade
organic pollutants in water.

Figure 13 Proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic generation
of ROS by
the nZnO followed by the degradation of organic pollutants.

On the other hand, the excited
electrons (e–)
on the CB have the ability to generate ROS [such as superoxide radical
anions (O2–) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH)] in water. These short-lived, very active, and
nonspecific ROS eventually initiate a series of reactions, which can
degrade persistent and harmful organic pollutants. The successive
degradation of organic pollutants may lead to the mineralization,
which is the formation of harmless gases, viz., CO2 and
H2O.

4 Conclusions and Summary
In conclusion, we report a simple and fast method for the synthesis
of nZnO of about 35 nm in size by heating a paste of zinc nitrate
hexahydrate and sucrose on the hot plate. The as-prepared nZnO exhibited
good photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO and MB in water.
The nZnOs were found to be almost equally active in degrading MO and
MB in deionized as well as simulated FDW matrices. The photocatalytic
generation of hydroxyl radical was also confirmed by the TA PL tests.
The stability of the nZnO was studied for 5 cycles over a period of
2 weeks, which demonstrated no loss of the catalytic activity. The
method described in this study can be utilized for the synthesis of
nZnO, which in turn could potentially be applied for the photocatalytic
degradation of organic pollutants in water. The significance of this
report is the simplicity and robustness of the method for the synthesis
of nZnO, which could be adapted for the synthesis of a wide variety
of other metal and mixed metal oxide nanoparticles for a wide spectrum
of applications.
