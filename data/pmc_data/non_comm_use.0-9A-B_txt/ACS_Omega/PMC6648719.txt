Intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) lack an ordered 3D structure.
These proteins contain one or more intrinsically disordered protein
regions (IDPRs). IDPRs interact promiscuously with other proteins,
which leads to their structural transition from a disordered to an
ordered state. Such interaction-prone regions of IDPs are known as
molecular recognition features. Recent studies suggest that IDPs provide
structural plasticity and functional diversity to viral proteins that
are involved in rapid replication and immune evasion within the host
cells. In the present study, we evaluated the prevalence of IDPs and
IDPRs in human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) proteome. We also
investigated the presence of MoRF regions in the structural and nonstructural
proteins of HTLV-1. We found abundant IDPRs in HTLV-1 bZIP factor,
p30, Rex, and structural nucleocapsid p15 proteins, which are involved
in diverse functions such as virus proliferation, mRNA export, and
genomic RNA binding. Our study analyzed the HTLV-1 proteome with the
perspective of intrinsic disorder identification. We propose that
the intrinsic disorder analysis of HTLV-1 proteins may form the basis
for the development of protein disorder-based drugs.

1 Introduction
Structurally,
proteins are heterogeneous entities consisting of
folded regions with variable conformational dynamics and disordered
regions that do not have well-folded structures. Intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs) are proteins that lack an ordered 3D structure. They
contain one or more intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs).1−3 Several studies have indicated that IDPs and proteins containing
IDPRs are abundant in nature with ∼25–30% of eukaryotic
proteins being mostly disordered and >50% of the disordered eukaryotic
proteins possessing long-disordered regions.2,4 Functions
of IDPs and IDPRs typically complement the functions of ordered proteins
and domains. IDPs and IDPRs have been identified as key players in
many critical cellular processes, such as being the component of macromolecular
complexes wherein their conformational flexibility helps mediate interactions
with binding partners.5 Because of the
conformational plasticity, IDPs can act as hubs in the interaction
networks and accomplish several functions in cell signaling and regulation.2,3 IDPRs are relatively long (>30 residues) stretches of disordered
regions that flank globular domains on one or both ends.1,3,6 IDPs and IDPRs are also being
implicated in various human diseases.7 It
has been recognized that disordered regions can be a new and attractive
target for drug design.8 IDPs typically
interact with binding partners through short sequence motifs called
molecular recognition features (MoRFs), making them capable of undergoing
a disorder-to-order transition.9−12 IDPRs are enriched in amino acids that have a high
mean net charge (that promote a strong electrostatic repulsion) and
a low mean hydropathy (that lower the compaction of the polypeptide).
Such amino acids are termed as “disorder-promoting amino acids”
and include Gln, Ser, Pro, Glu, and Lys. Similarly, amino acids that
have a low mean net charge and high mean hydropathy are termed as
“order-promoting amino acids”, such as Cys, Trp, Ile,
Tyr, Phe, Leu, Val, Asn, His, and Met. However, there are some amino
acids that are intermediate between disorder- or order-promoting amino
acids, such as Ala, Gly, Thr, Arg, and Asp.1 Because IDPs lack structural conformation under physiological conditions,
they exist as the heterogeneous ensemble and are capable of rapidly
changing conformation upon binding. In addition to this, IDPs are
unable to crystallize; therefore, computational tools have provided
an advantageous approach for analyzing IDPs/IDPRs.

Various studies
have indicated that the prevalence of IDPs in the
viral proteome is similar to eukaryotes; however, the prevalence of
IDPs is higher in RNA viruses.13 The disordered
nature of viral proteins is well suited for viral life-cycle and physiology.
A large number of viruses have a small genome that encodes for only
a few proteins, and the intrinsically disordered nature of viral protein
enables them to interact with and modulate a wide range of host proteins
and pathways. The IDPRs also reduce the drastic effect of the mutation
on the structure and function of IDPs, which are highly prevalent
in RNA viruses.14 Most of the IDPs from
viruses contain MoRF regions that regulate the functionality of the
viruses. These MoRFs are very crucial for the viral proteins that
interact with host proteins to take over the cell for viral replication.15,16

The intrinsically disordered nature of the proteome of human
T
lymphotropic virus type 1 virus (HTLV-1) has not been studied till
date. In the present study, we analyzed the prevalence of IDPs in
HTLV-1 proteome and evaluated the MoRF regions. HTLV-1 was the first
virus found to be linked with human malignancy and it has evolved
to persist in the host for decades despite a vigorous virus–specific
host immune response. A better understanding of IDPs/IDPRs and MoRF-based
interactions of HTLV-1 proteins might assist in the development of
novel compounds that could alter the protein–protein interactions
and, therefore, can be implicated for the treatment of HTLV-1 infestation.
In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in
HTLV-1 proteome using well-established computational methods as used
earlier by several groups.15−23 Further, we have correlated the degree of structural disorder with
functionality of HTLV-1 proteins. This study provides an unconventional
direction that might help elucidating the molecular mechanisms of
virus–host interaction.

2 Results and Discussion
HTLV-1 is a single-stranded retrovirus, about 100 nm in diameter,
which expresses various proteins capable of inducing oncogenicity.24 According to an estimate, about 1 out of 25
HTLV-1 infected individuals develop malignancy, once the proviral
DNA is integrated into the host genome upon transmission.25 The complex retroviral genome codes for viral
structural proteins (Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env glycoproteins), regulatory
proteins (Rex and Tax), and accessory proteins (p12, p13, and p30).24 The negative strand of the proviral mRNA encodes
for basic leucine-zipper factor (HBZ).24,26 The complete
genome structure of the HTLV-1 virus is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Gene structure of HTLV-1
virus.

Despite its obvious threat, no
disorder analysis has been reported
for HTLV-1 proteins till date. Additionally, complete structures of
only protease (PDB ID: 4YDF; protease in complex with 3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidines
inhibitor), capsid p24 (PDB ID: 1QRJ), and Env (PDB ID: 1MG1) have been solved
so far. Only partial structures for matrix p19 (PDB ID: 4ZNY; residue 119–129
in complex the human TSG101-UEV domain), rex (PDB ID: 1EXY; residues 1–16
bound to it RNA aptamer), and tax (PDB ID: 2AV1; residue 11–19 bound to human
class I MHC HLA-A2 mutated at E63Q and K66A) are available. Therefore,
computational tools may provide more advantage for analyzing the disorder
propensities of the HTLV-1 proteins.

2.1 Compositional
Profiling
The IDPs
tend to differ in the composition of amino acids when compared with
structured/ordered proteins. Hence, a simple protein sequence analysis
termed as “compositional profiling” can provide a lot
of information about the nature of a protein. Table 1 shows that matrix protein p19 (MA), nucleocapsid
(NC), HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), p30, and Rex proteins were found to
be fairly enriched in disorder-promoting amino acids compared with
order-promoting amino acids, suggesting that they are likely to form
IDPRs. In addition to this, the compositional profiles of all HTLV-1
structural proteins and nonstructural proteins were compared with
a set of disordered proteins obtained from DisProt database (Figure 2A,B respectively).
Individual comparative analysis is discussed below.

Figure 2 Compositional profiling
analysis. (A) Structural proteins present
within HTLV-1. (B) Nonstructural proteins present within HTLV-1. The
amino acid composition of HTLV-1 proteins is compared with a set of
disorder proteins (black bars) that was obtained from DisProt database.
Positive values correspond to amino acid residues that are found abundantly
in specific HTLV-1 proteins. The negative values correspond to amino
acid residues that are depleted within the specific HTLV-1 protein.
Amino acids were placed from most order-promoting to most disorder-promoting,
respectively.

2.2 Per-Residue
Disordered Propensity and MoRF
Analysis
The per-residue disorder propensity analysis of
HTLV-1 proteins was carried out by using predictors, such as PONDR
VSL2, PONDR VL-XT, PONDR-FIT, IUPred, and RONN, all of which have
been assessed by CASP.27−29 The overall output of each predictor used was taken
into consideration to determine the overall propensity of forming
an IDPRs. Tables 2 and 3 show the physiochemical properties and the per-residue
disorder profile of each HTLV-1 protein, respectively. The molecular
weight (MW) and pI shown in Table 2 were predicted using the ProtParam tool available
in ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). Consistent with the compositional profiling analysis, per-residue
propensity analysis also shows that the proteins—MA, NC, HBZ,
p30, and Rex had several IDPRs within their sequence. Also, the p13
protein and the C-terminal domain of the Tax regulatory protein were
predicted to contain IDPRs. The PONDR-FIT versus JRONN plot further
showed the likelihood of forming disordered regions for NC, HBZ, Rex,
p13, p30, and MA proteins (Figure 3A).

PONDR-fit vs JRONN plot analysis represents the co-relation of disorder
content between PONDR-FIT (y-axis) and JRONN (x-axis) predictors. The plot distinguishes proteins as highly
ordered [IDP score <10% (and <0.1), yellow field], moderately
[IDP score between 10 and 30% (and between 0.1 and 0.3), light blue
field], and highly disordered [IDP score >30% (and >0.3), purple
area].
(B) CH–CDF analysis of structural and nonstructural proteins
present within HTLV-1. From the corresponding figure, the co-ordinates
for each protein were calculated using the output of two binary classifiers,
where the x-axis co-ordinates represent the average
vertical distance of the corresponding protein from the boundary line
in the CH-plot and the y-axis represents the average
vertical distance of the CDF curve from the CDF boundary in the CDF
plot. Additionally, four quadrants were depicted: quadrant 1 (Q1),
proteins predicted to be disordered by CH plot, but ordered by CDF
plot; quadrant 2 (Q2), proteins predicted to be ordered by both methods;
quadrant 3 (Q3), proteins predicted to be disordered by CDF plot,
but ordered by CH plot (e.g., putative molten globules and mixed proteins);
and quadrant 4 (Q4), proteins predicted to be disordered by both methods,
including proteins with extended disorders.

a Regions highlighted in bold correspond
to disordered regions having more than 30 amino acids at a stretch.

MoRF regions are short molecular
sites present within a long-disordered
region capable of undergoing a transition from partial disordered
to ordered state.9−11,30 Such transitions occur
upon binding to protein interactors or other molecular interactors
that are important for cellular recognition, signaling, and regulation.9−12,30 In our study, MoRF regions were
predicted by using the ANCHOR algorithm that is based on a pair-wise
estimation energy approach and developed from IUPred disorder predictors.31Table 3 shows the MoRF regions predicted by the ANCHOR algorithm.
In-depth analysis of individual proteins is discussed below.

The intractability of HTLV-1 proteins was evaluated by using Viruses.STRING
database that provides both experimental and predicted protein–protein
interaction information.32 The result of
the Viruses.STRING analysis is shown in Supporting Information Figure S1.

2.3 Evaluation
of Disorder Propensities by Binary
Classifiers
With respect to the per-residue propensity analysis,
the overall status of the proteins as “ordered” or “disordered”
was predicted by using binary classifiers. A combination of the outputs
of two classifiers, that is, CH (charged-hydropathy) and CDF (cumulative
distribution frequency), was used to generate the CH–CDF plot.
The CH-plot analysis can differentiate proteins with random coils
and pre-molten globules from molten globules and well-structured proteins.33,34 On the other hand, the CDF-plot analysis can differentiate between
all disordered conformations, that is, distinguishing molten globules
and mixed proteins from well-structured proteins.34,35 The CDF-plot analysis is more sensitive to protein disorders compared
with the CH-plot analysis due to the inclusion of various protein
attributes other than the charge and hydropathic properties.34 The location of a given protein on the CH–CDF
plot gives information about its overall physical and structural characteristics.
The CH–CDF plot depicted in Figure 3B shows that the HTLV-1 proteins—HBZ,
NC, Rex, and p30 fall in quadrant 4, indicating that they are likely
to be IDPs as a whole. On the other hand, the HTLV-1 proteins—p13
and MA fall in quadrant 3, indicating that they are mixed proteins
and are likely to contain both disordered regions as well as ordered
regions. Additionally, these proteins have a characteristic low net
charge and low hydropathy, the features that are similar to those
of unstructured proteins. The remaining HTLV-1 proteins fall in quadrant
2, indicating that they are mostly structured/ordered proteins.

2.4 Analysis of Structural Proteins of HTLV-1
The complex HTLV-1 genome codes for several structural proteins
include Gag, Pro, Pol (UniProt ID P14078), and the Env glycoproteins gp62
(UniProt ID P14075).24 The Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein is further
classified into a gene cluster that includes numerous proteins. The
Gag protein functions in the assembly of the virus and takes part
in the infectivity on the host.36 The Gag
protein is made up of three independent proteins: matrix protein (MA;
responsible for anchoring of the Gag polyprotein to the plasma membrane),
capsid protein (CA; important for the oligomerization of Gag during
assembly and core formation during virus maturation), and nucleocapsid
protein (NC; interacts with the genomic RNA signals and encapsulates
the viral genomic RNA). All of the three proteins are cleaved by a
retroviral protease protein, which is encoded by the pro gene.37−40 Also, the Pol polyprotein is cleaved by a protease into reverse
transcriptase (RT)/RNase H (p49 and p62 subunit) and integrase (IN),
which are required for the replication and integration of the viral
genome.24,41,42Figure 4 shows that per-residue disorder
propensity analysis of gag-pro-pol polyprotein and its cleavage into
its respective products.

Figure 4 Intrinsic disorder predisposition of Gag-Pro-Pol
polyprotein. Disorder
propensities were generated by PONDR VLXT, PONDR VSL2, PONDR-FIT,
IUPred (long), and IUPred (short) and are depicted by black, red,
green yellow, and dark yellow lines, respectively. Dark red dashed
lines represent the average of all disorder predictor’s scores
used in this analysis. Blue dotted lines represent MoRF binding regions
predicted using ANCHOR. Colored bars at the top of the plot show the
localization of the individual proteins. Corresponding cleavage sites
leading to the generation of mature individual proteins are shown
in gray bars.

2.4.1 Matrix
Protein p19 (MA)
HTLV-1
is an encapsulated virus whose envelope contains the viral MA within
the inner membrane. The MA is crucial for anchoring of the Gag polyprotein
to the plasma membrane38 and plays a role
in the genomic RNA packaging.43 Its ability
to anchor relies on the N-terminal myristoylation and the presence
of basic amino acids, like Lys and Arg that stabilize the binding
of the Gag polyprotein to the acidic plasma membrane surface.38,40 The basic amino acids are probably clustered in one region, even
though distributed throughout the primary sequence of the MA protein.
The HTLV-1 MA contains eight basic amino acids that individually do
not have any role in the attachment but as a whole, and they help
in the anchoring of the Gag polyprotein to the plasma membrane.38,40 In fact, it has been reported that none of the basic residues is
important for Gag targeting but nearly all are crucial for subsequent
stages of production, events leading to budding of the virus particles,
and infectivity.38 Thus, such an association
is required for the final assembly and budding of the virus particles.

The HTLV-1 MA, consisting of 129 amino acid residues, has a MW
of ∼14.2 kDa and mean predicted percent of intrinsic disorder
(PPIDmean) of 42.63% (Table 2). The PPIDmean was obtained from the output of five predictors
used in our analysis (PONDR VLXT, PONDR VSL2, PONDR FIT, IUPred Long,
and IUPred short). The compositional profiling analysis of MA, when
compared with a set of disordered proteins, showed that MA is enriched
in several order-promoting amino acids (e.g., Ile, Tyr, Leu, and His)
but depleted in two disorder-promoting amino acids (i.e., Glu and
Lys). Additionally, MA was found to be highly depleted in Val, Asn,
Met, Thr, Asp, and Gly but highly enriched in Gln, Pro, and Ser when
compared with DisProt proteins (Figure 2A). A detailed amino acid composition of HTLV-1 MA
is shown in Figure 5A.

blue color represents order-promoting amino acids, and yellow color
represents amino acids that are indifferent to disorder or order.

The disorder propensity analysis
of HTLV-1 MA is illustrated in Figure 6A. In the figure,
on combining the output scores of all the predictors, the mean analysis
showed the presence of two disordered regions—[1–14]
and [89–129], where the longest disordered region was 41 residues
long [89–129]. Interestingly, the CDF-plot analysis (Figure 3B) predicted this
protein to be disordered, whereas the CH-plot analysis predicted this
protein to be ordered. Thus, an agreement can be made that this protein
is characterized by low mean net charge and low hydropathy but it
might contain other characteristics that favor unstructured assembly.

red, green yellow, and dark yellow lines, respectively. Dark red dashed
lines represent the average of all disorder predictor’s scores
used. Blue dotted lines represent MoRF binding regions predicted using
ANCHOR.

The ANCHOR analysis showed the
presence of three ANCHOR indicated
binding sites (AIBS): [63–70], [82–90], and [123–129]
(Figure 6A). One region
was filtered out due to insufficient criteria [48–48]. Interestingly,
AIBS—[82–90] partially coincides with the longest disordered
region—[89–129] predicted by the mean analysis. Also,
it is interesting to note that this region is the MA–CA cleavage
site, which suggests that the flexibility in this region is required
for protease binding and cleavage. A recent cryo-EM analysis indicated
that the HTLV-1 Gag virus-like particles (VLPs) lattice is less ordered
compared with HIV Gag VLPs, which could be due to disordered regions
in HTLV-1 MA.44

2.4.2 Capsid
Protein p24 (CA)
Like any
other retroviruses, HTLV-1 is enveloped and packaged with two genomic
RNA within a spherical core structure. This core structure is formed
by the ∼24 kDa CA. The HTLV-1 CA protein functions in the Gag
oligomerization during assembly and in the formation of the spherical
core that encapsulates the genomic RNA-nucleocapsid complex.39 Initially, the HTLV-1 CA is synthesized as a
domain of the structural Gag-polyprotein. As the Gag assembles on
the plasma membrane along with other viral proteins and RNA, acquiring
the outer membrane for budding from the infected cells, the CA protein
is cleaved into a newly folded mature virion by a viral protease protein.37 The mature CA that forms the core folds into
two independent domains, N-terminal domain (NTD; stretching between
15 and 127 amino acid position) and the C-terminal domain (CTD; stretching
between 131 and 206 amino acid position), which are joined by a linker
peptide (128AKD130 residues).37,39 The NTD residues form a β-hairpin upon cleavage, which is
further stabilized by the formation of salt bridges between the conserved
P1 and a Asp/Glu residue from helix 3.37 This refolded CA protein was postulated to be important for the
CA–CA interface, crucial for the formation of the spherical
core, and is required for initiating replication in the next infectivity.37 Mutational analysis showed that the CTD region
is not involved in the Gag–Gag interaction, whereas NTD mutation
impairs virion morphogenesis, and thus considered essential for VLP
formation.37

The HTLV-1 CA consists
of 214 amino acids and has a MW of ∼24 kDa and PPIDmean of 24.76% (Table 2). The compositional profiling analysis of HTLV-1 CA, when compared
with a set of disorder proteins, showed that it is enriched in several
order-promoting amino acids (i.e., Trp, Leu, and His) and depleted
in several disorder-promoting amino acids (i.e., Ser, Glu, and Lys)
(Figure 2A). However,
HTLV-1 CA was found to be highly enriched in Pro and Gln that are
disorder-promoting amino acids. A detailed amino acid composition
of HTLV-1 CA is shown in Figure 5B.

Mean disorder propensity analysis of HTLV-1
CA showed the presence
of five disordered regions—[1–33], [93], [95–106],
[166], and [209–214], with the longest disordered region being
33 residues long [1–33] (Figure 6B). With respect to the CH–CDF plot analysis,
HTLV-1 CA was predicted to be fully ordered protein (Figure 3B). This prediction is supported
by an NMR study that predicted HTLV-1 CA to be more rigid compared
with HIV CA.45

The ANCHOR analysis
of HTLV-1 CA (Figure 6B) showed the presence of three AIBS—[18–23],
[57–68], and [116–122]. Also, three regions were filtered
out due to their small sizes, [41–44], [148–148], and
[150–152]. The AIBS—[18–23] is present within
the longest disordered region—[1–33] as predicted by
the mean analysis. The presence of disordered regions and AIBS suggests
that CA might exhibit some degree of flexibility. As a polyprotein,
during cleavage and after cleavage, this flexibility might help it
to form a rigid structure using the Pro1-Asp54 salt bridge.46

2.4.3 Nucleocapsid
Protein p15 (NC)
The
retroviral particle, NC, is an important component of the capsid as
it encloses the dimeric genomic RNA. It is critical for recognition
and packaging of the viral genome and hence considered a suitable
target for antiretroviral therapy. The HTLV-1 NC is a neutral protein
characterized by a basic NTD and a negatively charged CTD.47 Two zinc-finger binding domains (i.e., ZF1 and
ZF2) are present at positions 11–28 and 34–51.47 The NC of HIV plays a critical role in the binding
and packing of RNA and also has strong chaperone activity that helps
in reverse transcription and integration of the viral genome. However,
the HTLV-1 NC nonspecifically binds to genomic RNA and exhibits very
poor chaperone activity.48 It has been
reported that zinc-finger binding domains can interact with each other,
while NTD can interact with the CTD via electrostatic interactions
when NC is not bound to RNA. Such an intramolecular interaction is
postulated to control the binding of this protein to DNA and impairing
chaperone properties of this protein.47

The HTLV-1 NC consists of 85 amino acids with a MW of ∼9.4
kDa. PPIDmean predicted an average of 91.76% disordered
region in the protein (Table 2). The compositional profiling analysis of the HTLV-1 NC,
when compared with a set of disorder proteins, showed that NC is enriched
in several order-promoting amino acids (e.g., Cys, Trp, Leu, and His)
and depleted in several disorder-promoting amino acids (e.g., Ser
and Glu) (Figure 2A).
Additionally, the HTLV-1 NC was found to be depleted in Ile, Tyr,
Phe, Val, Asn, Met, and Ala and highly enriched in Pro when compared
with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino acid composition of the HTLV-1
NC is shown in Figure 5C.

Disorder propensity analysis of the HTLV-1 NC shows the
presence
of two disordered regions, that is, [1–16] and [24–85],
with the longest disordered region being 62 residues long [24–85]
(Figure 6C). As a whole,
the CH–CDF plot (Figure 3B) analysis predicted this protein to be fully disordered.
The disordered and flexible nature of the NC might enable the intramolecular
interaction of the protein to preclude it from functioning as a better
chaperone. The disordered nature of the NC might also be responsible
for its inability to bind with the packing signal on the HTLV-1 genomic
RNA.

The ANCHOR analysis showed the presence of two AIBS—[64–75]
and [80–85] (Figure 6C). One region was filtered out due to insufficient criteria
[19–19]. Interestingly, both the AIBS coincide with the longest
disordered region predicted [47–105] by the mean analysis of
the predictors used.

2.4.4 Protease
HTLV-1
protease is a homodimeric
aspartic protease that consists of 125 amino acid residues and has
a high sequence similarity with other retroviral proteases. It is
encoded in a reading frame spanning from the 3′-end of the gag region to the 5′-end of the pol region (Figure 1),
where its synthesis occurs by ribosomal frameshifting. Structurally,
this protein has an active site motif similar to other retroviral
proteases and has homology in sequences flanking the active region
as well.49 Upon maturation, this protease
cleaves the Gag precursor into MA, CA, and NC proteins, as well as
Pol precursor into RT and IN proteins.41 This indicates the crucial role of HTLV-1 protease in viral replication.

Reports suggest that the C-terminal extension of this protein is
key to the dimerization in the absence of a ligand.50 The flexibility of the C-terminal tail allows the protease
to switch between a compact structure and a more freely opened structure.50 The HTLV-1 protease consists of 125 amino acids
and has a MW of ∼13.6 kDa. The average percentile of disorder
region is quite low with a PPIDmean of 20%.

The compositional
profiling analysis of the HTLV-1 protease showed
that it is enriched in several order-promoting amino acids (i.e.,
Ile, Leu, and Val) and depleted in several disorder-promoting amino
acids (i.e., Ser, Glu, and Lys) (Figure 2A). Additionally, the HTLV-1 protease was
found to be depleted in Trp, Tyr, Phe, His, Asn, Met, and Gly and
highly enriched in Gln and Pro when compared with DisProt proteins.
A detailed amino acid composition of protease is shown in Figure 5D.

Disorder
propensity analysis of the HTLV-1 protease showed the
presence of two disordered regions, that is, [1–19] and [120–125],
with the longest disordered region being 19 residues long [1–19]
(Figure 6D). As a whole,
the CH–CDF analysis predicted this protein to be fully ordered
(Figure 3B). The ANCHOR
analysis showed no AIBS present whatsoever.

2.4.5 Reverse
Transcriptase
The HTLV-1
RT protein is essential for the replication of the viral genome, making
it a potential drug target. This protein has not been fully characterized
yet; however, a recent study has suggested that Pol encodes for IN,
a large subunit of reverse transcriptase p62 (RTp62), and a small
subunit of reverse transcriptase p49 (RTp49).51

RTp49, the small subunit, consists of 439 amino acids with
a MW of ∼49 kDa. The disordered region present within this
protein is predicted to be fairly low with a PPIDmean of
9.13% (Table 2). The
compositional profiling analysis of the HTLV-1 RTp49 showed that it
is enriched in several order-promoting amino acids (e.g., Trp, Leu,
and His) and depleted in two disorder-promoting amino acids (i.e.,
Lys and Glu) (Figure 2A). Additionally, the protein was depleted in Val, Asn, Met, Arg,
Asp, Gly, and Ala and highly enriched in Gln and Pro when compared
with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino acid composition of the HTLV-1
RTp49 is shown in Figure 5E. Disorder propensity analysis of the protein is illustrated
in Figure 6E. The mean
analysis showed the presence of four disordered regions, that is,
[1–17], [72–89], [203–205], and [437–439],
with the longest disordered region being 17 residues long [1–17]
and [72–89]. However, as a whole, the CH–CDF analysis
predicted this protein to be fully ordered (Figure 3B). The ANCHOR analysis showed the presence
of one AIBS, that is, [21–32] (Figure 6E).

RTp62, the large subunit, consists
of 585 amino acid residues with
a MW of ∼65.5 kDa. The disorder regions present within this
protein are predicted to be fairly low with a PPIDmean of
6.49% (Table 2). The
compositional profiling analysis of the HTLV-1 RTp62 shows that it
is enriched in several order-promoting amino acids (i.e., Trp, Leu,
and His) and depleted in two disorder-promoting amino acids (i.e.,
Lys and Glu) (Figure 2A). Additionally, the protein was found to be depleted in Val, Asn,
Met, Asp, Gly, and Ala and highly enriched in Gln and Pro when compared
with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino acid composition of the HTLV-1
RTp62 is shown in Figure 5F. Disorder propensity analysis, illustrated in Figure 6F, showed the presence of three
disordered regions, that is, [1–17], [72–89], and [204–206],
with the longest disordered region being 18 residues long [72–89].
However, as a whole, the CH–CDF analysis predicted this protein
to be fully ordered (Figure 3B). The ANCHOR analysis showed the presence of one AIBS, that
is, [21–32] (Figure 6F).

2.4.6 Integrase
The
Pol also encodes
for IN that consists of 295 amino acid residues and has a MW of ∼33
kDa. In general, IN is a retrovirus enzyme that mediates the integration
of the viral DNA into the host’s genomic DNA.52 However, currently, limited information is available for
HTLV-1 IN. The disordered propensity of this protein was predicted
to be fairly low with a PPIDmean of 17.96% (Table 2). The compositional profiling
analysis of the HTLV-1 IN showed that it is enriched in several order-promoting
amino acids (e.g., Cys, Trp, Leu, His, Asn, and Arg) and depleted
in two disorder-promoting amino acids (i.e., Glu and Lys) (Figure 2A). Additionally,
the protein was found to be depleted in Phe, Val, Met, Asp, and Gly
and moderately enriched in Gln, Ser, and Pro when compared with DisProt
proteins (Figure 2A).
A detailed amino acid composition of the protein is shown in Figure 5G.

Disorder
propensity analysis of the HTLV-1 IN showed the presence of six disordered
regions, that is, [1–10], [41–49], [91–98], [148–152],
[214], and [276–295], with the longest disordered region being
20 residues long [276–295] (Figure 6G). As a whole, the CH–CDF analysis
predicted this protein to be fully ordered (Figure 3B). The ANCHOR analysis showed the presence
of two AIBS, that is, [227–232] and [253–276] (Figure 6G). Three regions—[31–33],
[72–76], and [165–167] were filtered out as they did
not meet the criteria. The AIBS—[276–295] partially
coincides with the disordered region [276–295], as predicted
by the mean analysis.

2.4.7 Envelope Glycoprotein
(Env)
The
HTLV-1 Env is encoded by the gene env (gp62) and
is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereupon maturation
it is cleaved to a ∼46 kDa surface membrane protein (SU) and
a ∼21 kDa transmembrane protein (TM).40Figure 7A shows the
disorder propensity of Env glycoprotein and its cleavage products—SU
and TM, respectively. Colored bars at the top of the plot represent
the location of various proteins encoded within the Env.

Figure 7 Intrinsic disorder
predisposition of envelope glycoprotein. Disorder
propensities were generated by PONDR VLXT, PONDR VSL2, PONDR-FIT,
IUPred (long), and IUPred (short) and are depicted by black, red,
green yellow, and dark yellow lines, respectively. Dark red dashed
lines represent the average of all disorder predictor’s scores
used. Blue dotted lines represent MoRF binding regions predicted using
ANCHOR. Colored bars at the top of the plot show the localization
of the individual proteins. Corresponding cleavage sites leading to
the generation of mature individual proteins are shown in gray bars.

and (C) TM.

2.4.8 Surface
Membrane Protein
The HTLV-1
SU protein consists of 292 amino acid residues and has a MW of ∼32
kDa. It contains three domains: an NTD (characterized by a α-helix
and a highly variable β-sheet), a central domain (characterized
by a Pro-rich region followed by a helix-turn-helix domain), and a
C-terminal domain (characterized by a conserved-PPI/FS-motif) that
are separated by hinges.40,53 The percentage of disorder
region within SU was predicted to be fairly low with a PPIDmean of 8.21% (Table 2). The compositional profiling analysis of the SU protein showed
that it is enriched in several order-promoting amino acids (i.e.,
Cys, Trp, Tyr, Leu, and His) and depleted in three disorder-promoting
amino acids (i.e., Glu, Lys, and Gln) (Figure 2A). Additionally, the SU protein was found
to be depleted in Met, Arg, Asp, Gly, and Ala and highly enriched
in Ser and Pro when compared with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino
acid composition of the SU protein is shown in Figure 5H. Disorder propensity analysis showed the
presence of two disordered regions, that is, [165–172] and
[283–292], with the longest disordered region being 10 residues
long [283–292] (Figure 7B). As a whole, the CH–CDF analysis predicted this
protein to be fully ordered (Figure 3B). The ANCHOR analysis showed no AIBS whatsoever (Figure 7B).

2.4.9 Transmembrane Protein
The HTLV-1
TM protein contains two domains, an N-terminal trimeric coiled-coil
formed by the leucine-zipper-like region and a C-terminal domain that
is structurally distinct from other retroviruses.54 Studies have suggested that the leucine-zipper-like region
is important for the fusion process, whereas the C-terminal domain
is crucial for the postfusion steps required for the virus’s
infectivity.53 The TM protein consists
of 176 amino acid residues with a MW of ∼19 kDa. The disorder
propensity of TM protein was predicted to be fairly low with a PPIDmean of 2.84% (Table 2). The compositional profiling analysis of the TM protein,
when compared with a set of disorder proteins, showed that it is enriched
in several order-promoting amino acids (i.e., Cys, Trp, Leu, His,
and Arg) and depleted in three disorder-promoting amino acids (i.e.,
Glu, Lys, and Pro) (Figure 2A). Additionally, the TM protein was found to be depleted
in Phe, Leu, Met, Thr, and Asp and enriched in Gln and Ser when compared
with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino acid composition of the TM
protein is shown in Figure 5I. Disorder propensity analysis showed the presence of one
disordered region of 5 residues long [172–176] (Figure 7C). As a whole, the CH–CDF
analysis predicted this protein to be fully ordered (Figure 3B). The ANCHOR analysis showed
no AIBS whatsoever (Figure 7C).

2.5 Analysis of Nonstructural
HTLV-1 Proteins
Besides the structural proteins (Gag, Pol,
and Env), the complex
retrovirus HTLV-1 also encodes for nonstructural proteins that typically
constitute the regulatory and accessory proteins. HTLV-1 uses alternative
splicing and internal initiation codons to generate these nonstructural
proteins, which lies within the pX region of the viral genome, that
is, between the env and the 3′LTR (Figure 1).24,55

The HTLV-1 nonstructural proteins are encoded within four
ORFs present within the pX region. The ORF I and ORF II produce an
alternative spliced form of mRNA that encodes four accessory proteins,
p12I, p27I, p13II, and p30II.56−58 These accessory proteins have been reported to be critical for the
viral infectivity and for maintaining a high viral load, activation
of the host cell, and regulation of gene transcription.24,55,56 HTLV-1 genome encodes for two
regulatory proteins—Rex and Tax within the pX ORF III and ORF
IV that share a common doubly spliced transcript.59−61 The ORF III
encodes for Rex protein that is primarily responsible for the nuclear
export of unspliced or singly spliced viral RNA.24 The ORF IV encodes for Tax protein that potentially activates
transcription, not only from the viral promoter (Tax-responsive elements)
but also from the enhancer elements of many cellular genes involved
in the host cell proliferation.24,62 The Tax protein has
oncogenic capabilities essential for HTLV-1 transformation of the
primary human T-cells.62,63

The minus strand (−)
of the HTLV-1 proviral genome also
encodes for several isoforms (generated from unspliced and spliced
mRNA) of the HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper factor (bZIP), denoted as
HBZ. Reports suggest that HBZ interacts with cellular factors like
Jun B, c-Jun, Jun D, cAMP response element binding (CREB), and CREB
binding protein (CBP)/p300 to modulate both the viral and cellular
gene expression.26,64 It was also reported that HBZ
plays a crucial role in T-cell proliferation.64

2.5.1 HTLV-1 Basic Leucine-Zipper Factor (HBZ)
The minus strand of HTLV-1 genome encodes for spliced HBZ (206
amino acid residues) and unspliced HBZ (209 amino acid residues) proteins,
denoted as sHBZ and usHBZ, respectively. The only difference between
sHBZ and usHBZ is of seven amino acids present within the NTD, which
are responsible for the short life span of usHBZ compared with sHBZ
in Adult T-cell Lymphoma cells.64 Both
forms of HBZ contain three domains: an N-terminal activation domain
(AD), a central domain, and a basic ZIP domain.64 Two −LXXLL– like motifs are present within
the N-terminal AD, which are known to bind to CBP/p300, thereby inhibiting
the recruitment of HTLV-1 promoter.65 The
HBZ bZIP binds to CREB/CREB2, which abolishes the Tax-responsive elements
and results in the suppression of Tax-mediated transcription forms.26 It has been reported that sHBZ can induce proliferation
via the first exon of the sHBZ transcript, whereas usHBZ is unable
to induce proliferation.66 Additionally,
HBZ can interact with c-Jun/JunB and suppress c-Jun/JunB-mediated
signaling by abrogating its DNA binding capability.67 On the other hand, HBZ can activate transcription by forming
heterodimers with JunD that binds to Sp1 transcription factor and
enhances the transcription of telomerase RT.68 Another important finding was the inhibition of the classical NF-κβ
pathway, critical for innate immunity and inflammatory responses,
by HBZ. The HBZ selectively suppresses p65-mediated classical NF-κβ
pathway without inhibiting alternative NF-κβ signaling
by (i) binding to p65 (abolishing its DNA binding capability) and
(ii) increasing the production of PDLIM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for
p65.69 This is crucial for HTLV-1 virulence,
survival, and infectivity. Recent reports suggest that transgenic
expression of HBZ increases Foxp3+ Treg cells and effector/memory
T cells, leading to the development of T cell lymphoma and systematic
inflammatory diseases.70 HBZ can also enhance
TGF-β signaling, critical for the development of Treg. These
findings suggest that HBZ is crucial for HTLV-1 proliferation, virulence,
survival, and infectivity.71

The
sHBZ protein consists of 206 amino acids residues and has a MW of
∼6.5 kDa. The average disorder propensity of the protein was
found to be very high with a PPIDmean of 81.06% (Table 2). The compositional
profiling analysis of the protein shows that it is enriched in two
order-promoting amino acids (i.e., Leu and Arg) and depleted in two
disorder-promoting amino acids (i.e., Ser and Pro) (Figure 2B). Additionally, the sHBZ
protein was found to be depleted in Ile, Tyr, Phe, His, Val, Asn,
Thr, Asp, and Ala and highly enriched in disorder-promoting amino
acids (Lys, Gln, and Glu) when compared with DisProt proteins. A detailed
amino acid composition of the sHBZ protein is shown in Figure 8A.

represents disorder-promoting amino acids, blue color represents order-promoting
amino acids, and yellow color represents amino acids that are indifferent
to disorder or order.

Detailed disorder propensity analysis of the sHBZ protein
showed
the presence of one disordered region, that is, [32–189] that
was 158 residues long (Figure 9A). As a whole, the CH–CDF analysis predicted this
protein to be fully disordered (Figure 3B). It is interesting to note that the disordered region
encompasses the NTD of HBZ that through its tandem (−LXXLL−)
domains interacts with transcription factor—CREB and also binds
to KIX-domain of coactivator—p300/CBP.26,72,73

Figure 9 Disorder predisposition of nonstructural proteins
within the HTLV-1
genome. (A) HBZ, (B) P12I, (C) p13, (D) p30II, (E) Rex, and (F) Tax.
Disorder profiles were generated by PONDR VLXT, PONDR VSL2, PONDR-FIT,
IUPred (long), and IUPred (short) and are depicted by black, red,
green yellow, and dark yellow lines, respectively. Dark red dashed
lines represent the average of all disorder predictor’s scores
used in this analysis. Blue dotted lines represent MoRF binding regions
predicted using ANCHOR.

The ANCHOR analysis showed the presence of three AIBS, that
is,
[1–30], [43–51], and [200–206] (Figure 9A). Three regions were filtered
out [99–103], [121–124], and [161–162] due to
their small size. The binding region [43–51] coincides with
the disordered region predicted by the mean analysis and also coincides
with second −LXXL– (44–53) motif. Because most
of the interactions and functions of HBZ are mediated through its
NTD, it was expected for this region to be intrinsically disordered.
A recent study has also supported these results, which provided evidence
of the intrinsically flexible nature of the HBZ NTD.74

2.5.2 P12
The p12
protein is generally
localized in cellular membranes, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum
and the Golgi bodies.75 The amino acid
analysis suggested the p12 to be a highly hydrophobic structural protein,
which is characterized by at least 32% Leu and 17% Pro.75 The p12 protein is highly conserved and contains
four Pro-rich Src homology 3 (SH3) binding domains, a motif critical
for interaction with proteins involved in intracellular signaling.
A di-Leu motif (−DXXXLL−) at amino acid position 26–31
and two transmembrane domains at positions 12–30 and 48–67
have also been identified. The p12 protein interacts with interleukin-2
receptor (IL-2R), drastically affects its surface expression, and
increases transcriptional activity of the signal transducers and activators
of transcription-5 (STAT5). The ability of p12 to lower the threshold
of T-cell activation and IL-2 production and the ability to increase
responsiveness to IL-2 by STAT5 activation suggests that p12 amplifies
physiological stimulations and it is involved in the proliferation
of infected cells in a microenvironment depleted in antigens and growth
factors.76,77 The p12 protein has been reported to bind
to free MHC class I heavy chains that subsequently fail to bind to
β2-microglobulin and translocated back to the cytosol,
where they are degraded by the proteasome. This binding contributes
to evasive measures of HTLV-1 from the host’s immune response.

The p12 protein consists of 99 amino residues and has a MW of ∼9.9
kDa. The disorder propensity of the p12 protein was found to be fairly
low with a PPIDmean of 8.08% (Table 2). The compositional profiling analysis of
the protein showed that it is enriched in three order-promoting amino
acids (i.e., Trp, Phe, and Leu) but depleted in three disorder-promoting
amino acids (i.e., Lys, Gln, and Glu) (Figure 2B). Additionally, the protein was depleted
in Ile, Tyr, His, Val, Asn, Asp, Thr, Gly, and Ala and highly enriched
in Ser and Pro when compared with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino
acid composition of the p12 protein is shown in Figure 8B. The disorder propensity analysis of p12
is depicted in Figure 9B.

Mean analysis of the disorder predictors showed only one
disordered
region that was 8 residues long [92–99] (Figure 9B). In addition, the CH–CDF analysis
predicted this protein to be fully ordered, as a whole (Figure 3B). The ANCHOR analysis showed
no AIBS whatsoever.

2.5.3 P13
The p13
protein consists of
87 amino acid residues and has a MW of ∼10 kDa. It consists
of a short leading sequence (between 1 and 5 amino acid position),
a positively charged amphipathic α-helix with an N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting signal between 22 and 31, a transmembrane
domain at position 30–40, a flexible hinge region between 42
and 48, and a C-terminus β-hairpin homologous to an α-bungarotoxin
binding peptide at position 65–75.76,78 The C-terminus of the p13 protein also contains multiple −PXXP–
motifs. Though p13 protein is usually localized in the inner membrane
of mitochondria, at a high level it might be localized even in the
nucleus, especially when co-expressed with Tax, suggesting its potential
role in modulating the apoptosis and transcriptional regulation.78 Because of its mitochondrial localization, p13
was proposed to function in mediating K+ influx, inner
mitochondrial membrane potential, and electron transport chain activity,
which subsequently affects Ca2+ and ROS production.78 Modulation of ROS level has been proposed to
provide life-long persistence to HTLV-1 within the host cells.78 At a high level, the p13 protein is ubiquitinated
by Tax, leading to its translocation into the nucleus, thereby hampering
Tax-mediated viral gene transcription.78,79

The
disorder propensity of the p13 protein was found to be quite high
with a PPIDmean of 51.72% (Table 2). The compositional profiling analysis of
the p13 protein showed that it is enriched in several order-promoting
amino acids (i.e., Trp, Leu, His, and Arg) but depleted in three disorder-promoting
amino acids (i.e., Lys, Gln, and Glu) (Figure 2B). Additionally, the protein was depleted
in Phe, Asn, Asp, Gly, and Ala and highly enriched in Thr, Ser, and
Pro when compared with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino acid composition
of the p13 protein is shown in Figure 8C.

The mean analysis of the p13 protein showed
only one long disordered
region that was 45 residues long [43–87] (Figure 9C). Interestingly, the CH–CDF
analysis predicted this protein to be disordered by CDF analysis,
whereas the CH analysis predicted this protein to be ordered (Figure 3B), suggesting that
although this protein is characterized by low mean net charge and
low hydropathy, this protein might contain other characteristics that
favor disordered structure. The ANCHOR analysis showed no AIBS whatsoever.

2.5.4 P30
The P30 protein consists of
241 amino acid residues and has a MW of ∼26.8 kDa. The p30
protein is highly basic with a net positive charge. It contains three
nuclear localization signals (NLS1 between 66 and 73; NLS2 between
91 and 98; and NLS3 between 200 and 241 amino acid position) along
with an Arg-rich nucleolar localization/retention (NoRS) domain between
73 and 78 position. The P30 protein also contains a Rex-binding domain
between 131 and 164, a p300-binding domain between 131 and 161, and
a DNA-binding domain between 100 and 179, which represses LTR-mediated
transcription.24,75,76 Although the exact role of p30 is still unknown, few reports have
postulated its function in cellular processes like cell cycle, DNA
repair, and mRNA export.24 It has also
been reported that the p30 protein promotes virus latency to escape
host immune responses by retaining tax/rex mRNA and preventing their export into the cytoplasm, which subsequently
decreases the expression of these two positive regulators of HTLV-1
replication.80 This, in turn, favors cell
proliferation and clonal expansion of the infected cells. The P30
protein is also known to interact with many host proteins, such as
ATM, REG-gamma, p300, TIP60, PU1, and MRN complex, to regulate viral
and cellular gene expression, to modulate the cellular environment,
and to facilitate viral persistence and transformation.81

The average disorder propensity of the
p30 protein was found to be quite high with a PPIDmean of
52.69% (Table 2). The
compositional profiling analysis of the p30 protein, when compared
with a set of disorder proteins, showed that the protein is enriched
in several order-promoting amino acids (e.g. Cys, Trp, Phe, Leu, His,
and Arg) but depleted in three disorder-promoting amino acids (e.g.,
Lys, Gln, and Glu) (Figure 2B). Additionally, the protein was depleted in Ile, Tyr, Val,
Asn, Met, Asp, Gly, and Ala and highly enriched in Ser and Pro when
compared with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino acid composition
of the p30 protein is shown in Figure 8D. The mean analysis of the p30 protein showed two
disordered regions, that is, [75–155] and [197–241],
with the longest disordered region being 81 residues long [75–155]
and the second longest disordered region being 45 residues long [197–241]
(Figure 9D). Additionally,
the CH–CDF analysis predicted this protein to be fully disordered,
as a whole (Figure 3B). The disordered nature of the p30 protein might enable it to interact
with various host proteins and viral RNA at the same time and act
as a multifunctional protein required for HTLV-1 persistence. The
ANCHOR analysis showed two AIBS, that is, [152–163] and [172–190].
One region was filtered out [116–117] (Figure 9D). Region [152–163] was partially
present within the disordered region as predicted by the mean analysis.

2.5.5 Rex
HTLV-1 encodes a regulatory
protein—Rex that actively transports unspliced and singly spliced
mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.24,82 The HTLV-1 Rex is a positive regulator phosphoprotein that consists
of 189 amino acid residues and has a MW of ∼21 kDa. It is found
predominantly within the nucleus, nucleoli, and nucleolar speckles
of infected HTLV-1 cell lines.24,82,83 The Rex protein contains multiple functional domains that help in
the HTLV-1 replication and pathogenesis. The protein constitutes an
NLS corresponding to the N-terminal residues (1–19), which
is highly rich in Arg.82 This stretch of
positive residues also acts as the RNA binding domain, where it binds
to the Rex responsive elements (RxRE) of the viral unspliced mRNA.82,84,85 This binding is a crucial step
for transactivation of mRNA export. The Rex protein also contains
two flanking multimerization domains corresponding to positions [57–66]
and [106–124]. Multiple Rex proteins can bind to a single mRNA
via protein–protein interactions and protein–RNA interaction
prior to export.82 An AD, Leu-rich domain
containing a nuclear export signal (NES), is also present within the
Rex protein at the central region. NES is a Leu-rich motif that can
interact with numerous other proteins via protein–protein interactions.82

The disorder propensity of the Rex protein
was found to be rather high with a PPIDmean of 79.36% (Table 2). The compositional
profiling analysis of the Rex protein showed that the protein is enriched
in two order-promoting amino acids (e.g., Trp and Arg) but depleted
in two disorder-promoting amino acids (i.e., Lys and Glu) (Figure 2B). Additionally,
the protein was found to be depleted in Ile, His, Val, Asn, Asp, Gly,
and Ala and highly enriched in Gln, Ser, and Pro when compared with
DisProt proteins. A detailed amino acid composition of the Rex protein
is shown in Figure 8E. Disorder propensity analysis of the Rex protein is illustrated
in Figure 9E. The mean
of disorder predictors used showed the presence of two disordered
regions, that is, [1–28] and [68–189], with the longest
disordered region being 122 residues long [68–189]. As a whole,
the CH–CDF analysis predicted this protein to be fully disordered
(Figure 3B). The ANCHOR
analysis showed the presence of five AIBS, that is, [25–65],
[80–92], [106–117], [143–155], and [168–174]
(Figure 9E). Region
[25–65] partially coincides with the smaller disordered region
as predicted by the mean analysis, whereas [80–92], [106–117],
[143–155], and [168–174] coincide with the longer disordered
region predicted by the mean analysis. The data presented here are
supported by a computation analysis of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated
Rex protein, which predicted unphosphorylated Rex protein to be fully
disordered protein.86

2.5.6 Tax
The HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein
is the major detrimental protein, which aids in the activation of
viral and cellular gene expression and triggers uncontrolled cell
proliferation and transformation.24 The
HTLV-1 Tax protein consists of 353 amino acid residues and has a MW
of ∼39.5 kDa. It is predominantly found in the nucleus due
to the presence of NLS within its N-termini. It can be present in
the cytoplasm, from where it gets translocated to the nucleus and
activates viral LTR-mediated transcription via binding to the Tax-responsive
elements (TxRE).24,62 The Tax protein mediates viral
gene transcription by interacting with CREB/activating transcription
factor and forming a complex with TxRE, where it regulates LTR’s
transactivation both positively as well as negatively. Such interactions
repress expressions of the cellular genes, such as p53, cyclin A,
and c-my.87 Additionally, Tax also interacts
with activators involved in the SRF pathway such as activator protein
1 (Sap1). Upon stabilization of these complexes, Tax recruits transcription
initiation co-activators–CBP/p300 and P-CAF. Tax is involved
in various cellular functions within the HTLV-1 infected cells, rendering
viral persistence and neoplastic transformation.87,88 Upon ubiquitination, Tax binds to NF-κβ essential modulators
(NEMO and IKKγ), TAK1, and MAP3K, thereby activating and stimulating
IKK activity and subsequently resulting in the activation of NF-κβ
pathway.62 Tax stimulates cell proliferation
from G1 phase to S phase through Rb hyperphosphorylation and activation
of E2F transcription activators. Additionally, it activates CDK6 by
interacting with CDK4, CDK6, and CDK inhibitors.62,87 It is also known that Tax promotes DNA damage by suppressing the
expression of DNA polymerase β and human telomerase RT, essential
for DNA repair.87 Interestingly, Tax contains
a PBZ binding motif (PBM, consisting of four amino acid sequences)
at the C-terminus, which is thought to be important for transformation
and proliferation. Tax PBM has been demonstrated with three PDZ containing
proteins (hDLG, MAGUK, and pro-IL16) in humans, all of which are involved
in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression.87

The disorder propensity analysis showed that the
Tax protein contains a limited number of disordered regions with a
PPIDmean of 11.33% (Table 2). The compositional profiling analysis of the Tax
protein showed that Tax is enriched in several order-promoting amino
acids (e.g., Cys, Trp, Phe, Leu, and His) but depleted in two disorder-promoting
amino acids (i.e., Lys and Glu) (Figure 3B). Additionally, Tax was found to be depleted
in Val, Asn, Met, Arg, Asp, and Ala and highly enriched in Pro when
compared with DisProt proteins. A detailed amino acid composition
of the Tax protein is shown in Figure 8F. The mean analysis of the disorder predictors used
showed three disordered regions to be present in the Tax protein,
that is, [1–3], [89–94], and [324–353], with
the longest disordered region being 30 residues long [324–353]
(Figure 9F). However,
the CH–CDF analysis predicted this protein to be fully ordered
(Figure 3B). The ANCHOR
analysis predicted no AIBS whatsoever.

3 Conclusions
Most of the HTLV-1 proteins analyzed in this
study contained disordered
region and are known to involve in diverse mechanisms of virus survival
and immune evasion. Specifically, IDPRs, having more than 30 amino
acids at a stretch, were predicted in HTLV-1 bZIP factor, p30, Rex,
and structural nucleocapsid p15 proteins, which are involved in diverse
functions such as virus proliferation, mRNA export, and genomic RNA
binding. Additionally, as a whole, these proteins were predicted and
classified as IDPs, where disorder percentile was not below 50 percent.
Very limited study has been carried out concerning the mechanisms
of the HTLV-1 pathogenesis. The present study provides novel insights
from the unique perspective of intrinsically disordered regions of
HTLV-1 proteins that might help elucidating the molecular mechanisms
of virus–host interaction. The disordered proteins or the proteins
containing IDPRs, which have highly dynamic nature and flexibility,
play a significant role in disease development and progression. As
disordered regions are attractive and challenging drug targets, strategies
should be developed to find small inhibitors against IDPRs that could
serve as effective antivirals. The occurrence of intrinsic disorder
in HTLV-1 proteins strongly suggests that disorder needs to be seriously
considered in the drug discovery process against HTLV-1 infection.8,89,90 Also, a detailed biophysical
study of the HTLV-1 disordered proteins could provide a platform to
develop novel antiviral therapeutics.

4 Methods
4.1 Retrieval of Sequences
A total of
eight protein sequences of HTLV-1 were retrieved from UniProt database
for disorder analysis (namely, P14075—envelope glycoprotein
gp62, P14078—Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein, P0C745—HTLV-1
basic zipper factor, P0CK16—accessory protein p12I, P0CK17—accessory
protein p30II, P0C206—Rex, P14079—Tax and C6L855—p13
protein). All the sequences belong to HTLV-1 virus isolate Caribbean
HS-35 subtype-A.

4.2 Compositional Profiling
Compositional
profiling, performed using Composition Profiler, was used to study
the disordered nature of the HTLV-1 proteins. Compositional profiling
was performed by calculating the fractional difference in the composition,
(CX – Corder)/(Corder), for each amino acid within
the query protein set (i.e., HTLV-1 proteins) and a set of reference
proteins (i.e., disordered proteins obtained from DisProt Database).91 In (CX – Corder)/(Corder), CX represents the content of a given amino acid
in the query protein or the DisProt protein and Corder represents the standard value for a set of ordered
proteins from PDB Select 25.91,92

4.3 Analysis
of Per-Residue Disorder Propensity
Several disorder predictors
are available online, out of which,
the predictors of the PONDR family (e.g. PONDR VLXT, PONDR VSL2B,
and meta-predictor PONDR FIT), IUPred, and RONN were used to evaluate
the disorder propensities of the HTLV-1 proteins.28,29,93−95 Among these, PONDR VSL2B,
which is based on two predictors (one optimized for long disordered
regions whereas another optimized for short disorder regions) combined
by an independent meta-predictor, has the best accuracy for the prediction
of disordered regions of various lengths.29 PONDR VLXT, although not known to be the most accurate predictor,
is very sensitive to local sequence peculiarity where disordered binding
sites are usually associated.27 PONDR FIT
meta-predictor consists of six individual predictors (PONDR VLXT,
PONDR VSL2, PONDR VL3, IUPred, FoldIndex, and TopIDP) and its accuracy
is better than each of its component predictors.95 IUPred prediction is based on the ab initio approach that
uses statistical interaction potential. IUPred short has a comparatively
better prediction accuracy due to its ability to predict missing residues
in X-ray structures.93 The outputs of the
following predictors were in the form of score value between 0 and
1 for individual residues of a particular protein. Residues with output
values above 0.5 were considered as disordered. Per-residue disorder
propensity analysis for each individual protein was interpreted.

Additionally, for further illustration of the disorder propensities
of the HTLV-1 proteins, the PONDR FIT–JRONN plot was constructed.94,95 In the corresponding plot, HTLV-1 proteins were segregated as highly
ordered (disorder score < 0.1, percentage of disordered < 10%),
moderately disordered (disorder score between 0.1 and 0.3, percentage
of disordered between 10 and 30%), and highly disordered (disorder
score > 0.3, percentage of disordered > 30%).

4.4 Disorder Propensity Analysis by Binary Classifiers
Additionally, binary classifiers were used to determine the overall
status of a protein as “ordered” or “disordered”
as a whole. A combination of the outputs of two classifiers was used,
that is, CH and CDF, to obtain the CH–CDF plot. In the CH–CDF
plot, the X-axis represents the average vertical
distance of the CDF curve from the CDF boundary line and the Y-axis represents the vertical distance of the corresponding
protein in CH plot from the CH boundary line.33−35

4.5 MoRF Analysis
The MoRF regions were
predicted by using the ANCHOR algorithm31 that is based on the pair-wise estimation energy approach developed
for IUPred disorder predictors. Binding sites predicted by this approach
are generally termed as AIBS. This analysis was performed for all
HTLV-1 proteins.
