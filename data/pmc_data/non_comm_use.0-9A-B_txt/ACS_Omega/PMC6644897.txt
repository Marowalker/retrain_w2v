Nanomaterial-loaded
thermoplastics are attractive for applications
in adaptive printing methods, as the physical properties of the printed
materials are dependent on the nanomaterial type and degree of dispersion.
This study compares the dispersion and the impact on the dielectric
properties of two common nanoparticles, nickel and iron oxide, loaded
into polystyrene. Comparisons between commercial and synthetically
prepared samples indicate that well-passivated synthetically prepared
nanomaterials are dispersed and minimize the impact on the dielectric
properties of the host polymer by limiting particle–particle
contacts. Commercial samples were observed to phase-segregate, leading
to the loss of the low-k performance of polystyrene.
The change in the real and imaginary dielectric was systematically
studied in two earth abundant nanoparticles at the concentration between
0 and 13 vol % (0–50 wt %). By varying the volume percentage
of fillers in the matrix, it is shown that one can increase the magnetic
properties of the materials while minimizing unwanted contributions
to the dielectric constant and dielectric loss. The well-dispersed
nanoparticle systems were successfully modeled through the Looyenga
dielectric theory, thus giving one a predictive ability for the dielectric
properties. The current experimental work coupled with modeling could
facilitate future material choices and guide design rules for printable
polymer composite systems.

Introduction
The development of
printable electronics that incorporate components
composed of nanoparticles embedded in polymer matrices requires a
uniform nanoparticle dispersion, which will not phase-segregate under
the printing conditions. The incorporation of nanoparticles (<100
nm) to modify polymer properties has been an active area of research
for more than a decade.1−7 Research in the early days focused on the mechanical property enhancements,
although more recently, the use of nanomaterials in plastics has attracted
attention for electronic applications particularly in flexible electronic
applications. The dielectric properties of nanoparticle-loaded plastics
can modify the dielectric properties of polymers for both high and
low dielectric applications.8−13 Maintaining low-k performance in polymers is critical
for insulating electrical interconnects in high-density, high-speed,
and high-frequency microelectronic devices, where increased resistance
and capacitive coupling in the circuit lead to signal delays and electrical
cross talk at interconnects.11,14−18 Contact and noncontact printing of modified inks for two-dimensional
printing19 and adaptation of additive manufacturing-based
fused deposition modeling (FDM)20,21 using nanopolymer blends22,23,32 require that the composite maintains
uniform distribution of spherical nanoparticles to avoid a low percolation
threshold, increase the dielectric breakdown strength and operational
frequency which scales with particle loading, and have minimal impact
on the polymer dielectric.25−29 The impact on the electrical, mechanical, and optical properties
of the polymer depends directly on the material type, surface passivation,
and degree of dispersion.

For printed electronics, the dielectric
properties of the nanocomposite
are critical to maintain the low-k properties of
the polymer.14 Studies have shown that
incorporation of uniform and small-sized nanoparticles in a dielectric
insulator matrix such as a polymer can broaden the operational frequency
range of the polymer dielectric, improve its dielectric breakdown
strength and electromagnetic shielding capability, and improve the
mechanical properties.16−22 These studies have shown that incorporation of nano- to micron-sized
particles leads to a rise in the dielectric constant with increasing
particle volume fraction primarily because of phase segregation,30−35 leading to interfacial polarizations at the particle–polymer
interface.34,36,37 Although the behavior is accounted for using effective medium theory
models, the role of phase segregation is not predictable in most cases.38−44

This study investigates the use of earth abundant (cheap and
widely
used) nanoparticles (Ni and Fe3O4) in a known
low-k dielectric polymer [polystyrene (PS)] to investigate
the impact on dielectric properties of incorporating Ni and Fe3O4 nanoparticles sourced from commercial (com)
and synthetic (syn) methods. The nanoparticles were loaded into 280
kDa PS at increasing volume fractions and analyzed through dielectric
spectroscopy, electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray, and magnetic
measurements to evaluate the particle distribution and dielectric
properties as a function of loading level. The study demonstrates
that the use of synthetically prepared nickel (Ni) and iron oxide
(Fe3O4) nanoparticles of sizes under 50 nm (diameter)
into PS to approximately 50% by weight outperforms commercially sourced
materials. The dielectric properties of the studied nanocomposite
system show that the properties can be systematically manipulated
with incorporation of up to 15 vol % loading when synthetically prepared
materials are employed. The composites exhibit minimal increase in
permittivity and loss tangent. The frequency-dependent behavior can
be modeled using effective medium theories. The use of surface-passivated
nanoparticles enhanced the ability to reduce aggregation, allowing
uniform blending. The composites were formed into printable filaments
without inducing aggregation as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) cross-sectional analysis. Nanoparticle composites that maintain
their dispersity in the filaments are adaptable to FDM manufacturing
of flexible electronics.

From an additive manufacturing outlook,
the use of well-passivated,
smaller nanoparticles leads to better phase dispersity in the polymer
and has a lower probability of clogging print heads during FDM printing
in comparison to larger-sized particles. Although nanoparticle–polymer
composites using gold, silver, and high-k ceramics
have been reported,24,45,46 the use of earth abundant materials as used in this study is important
if scale-up FDM printing methods are to become routine for flexible
electronics. The results of the current study are believed to be extendable
to other nanoparticle systems whether for optical properties (quantum
dots), magnetic properties (nanomagnets), or high-k applications (ceramics).

Results and Discussion
Using solution
blending methods, com and synthetically prepared
Ni and Fe3O4 nanoparticles were dispersed in
PS (280 kDa) to achieve nanocomposites containing 0–15 vol
% (Table 1). A volume
percentage of 15% is approximately a weight percentage of 50%. Higher
loadings were not studied, as the nanocomposite was observed to become
brittle above 15 vol %. Because nanoparticle miscibility in PS is
anticipated to be influenced by the preparative route, the nanoparticles
were selected from a com and a syn source. It is important to note
that the com sample is a representative sample but does not represent
all possible com sources. The sourcing of the com sample was to allow
quantities to be obtained at a cost comparable to syn preparative
routes for the materials under study.

In Figure 1, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) of the isolated nanoparticles, size dispersity
plots for the nanoparticles, and representative 8 mm × 1 mm nanocomposite
disks are shown. Analytical data on the nanoparticles including X-ray
powder diffraction, 300 K field sweep magnetization susceptibility
plots, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S3).
The studied Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibit the
same crystallographic phase, but comparison of the syn and com samples
reveals that the com samples are nonspherical, exhibit aggregation,
and are 50% larger (3.5 times larger volume) in size with a broader
size dispersity. The magnetic susceptibility of the com sample is
larger, consistent with the size difference.47−51 The Ni nanoparticles are spherical and exhibit nearly
identical size and size dispersities; however, the com sample is the
strongly magnetic face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, whereas the syn
sample is the weakly magnetic hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The surface
passivation and ligand content are different between the four samples,
as measured by TGA (Table 1). As shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3), the ligand content from TGA measurements in syn-Fe3O4 is 28.0 wt % oleic acid (OA)/oleylamine (OAm),
com-Fe3O4 is 7.6 wt % polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),
syn-Ni is 7.33 wt % OAm/tri-octylphosphine (TOP), and com-Ni has <3.66
wt % ligand content (ligand is proprietary). The com variants (com-Ni
and com-Fe3O4) featured a lower degree of ligand
bound to the surface in comparison to the synthesized particles.

is shown (inset).

The observed PS glass-transition
temperature (Tg) for the nanocomposites
at 0 vol % and at 15 vol % nanoparticle
exhibits similar Tg values (Tg = 108 °C), suggesting no impact on the polymer
melting behavior (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The results are consistent with the literature on similar
sized nanoparticles when dispersed in polymer matrices, where no significant
change in Tg is reported.52−54 The decomposition temperature of the nanocomposite increases with
increasing particle loading as shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). In consistent with this result, previous
studies have observed an increased thermal stability in nanoparticle-loaded
polymers.55−57

Nanoparticle Dispersion in Nanocomposites
The nanocomposites
shown in Figure 1 are
uniformly optically dense, exhibiting a linear increase in Ms with increasing volume fraction (Supporting Information, Figure S2), and the powder
X-ray diffraction (pXRD) shows a decrease in PS’s signal intensity
as the concentration of the nanoparticle increases (Supporting Information, Figure S6). The distribution of the
nanoparticles in PS was analyzed using small-angle X-ray (Figure 2) and cross-sectional
SEM–energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Figures 3 and 4).

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on the highest and lowest
nanoparticle
loadings for both the syn and com samples were performed to investigate
the microstructure of the formed composites. Of these samples, only
the synthetically prepared materials could be fully analyzed. The
nanocomposites formed using syn nanoparticles (Ni and Fe3O4) show a clear peak in the I versus q SAXS plot, which is indicative of ordering of particles
on the length scales probed (2π/q). From the
SAXS data, the interparticle spacing (d) can be extracted
from the length of the scattering vector q using
the lowest angle primary peak (q*) because d = 2π/q*, where d = 2r + 2l (r is
the nanoparticle radius and l represents the passivant
length). In the SAXS data for syn-Fe3O4 (r = 5.5 nm), q* occurs at a q of 0.25 nm–1 (d = 25.1 nm) for
the 0.69 vol % and a q* of 0.565 nm–1 (d = 11.1 nm) for the 10.9 vol %. For the syn-Ni
samples (r = 12 nm), at the lowest concentration
(0.49%), no definable q* is observed in the q range probed. At high concentration (8.5 vol %), the scattering
peak sharpens and occurs at 0.023 nm–1 corresponding
to d = 27 nm. The I versus q SAXS plot (Figure 2) for the com samples (Ni and Fe3O4)
does not show any peaks in the scattering pattern, resulting in the
inability to analyze particle distribution. Earlier studies concluded
that phase segregation of the nanoparticles leads to unidentifiable
scattering features.58,59

The experimental SAXS data
on the synthetically prepared systems
can be interpreted in terms of the degree of dispersion in the polymer
when the particle size is considered. syn-Fe3O4 is 11 nm (r = 5.5 nm) with a shell of 2l ≤ 5.6 nm for the OAm [l = 1.5–2.5
nm60,61/OA (l = 2.8 nm62)] passivating shell depending on the trans to
gauche content in the ligands, surface packing, and degree of passivation.
If Fe3O4 is aggregated, we anticipate an interparticle
spacing (d) between 11 and 17 nm.63 The
SAXS data for syn-Fe3O4 show at 10.9 vol %,
and the interparticle spacing is consistent with a description as
being aggregated within the composite. The low-concentration (0.69
vol %) syn-Fe3O4 sample can be considered on
average more dispersed based on the larger interparticle distance
observed in the SAXS data. For the Ni sample, the same conclusion
can be made because the Ni nanoparticle would be expected to have
a minimum interparticle distance of 30 nm reflecting the syn-Ni diameter
24 nm with a passivant shell of ≤6 nm (2l).
The measured interplanar distance of 27 nm in the SAXS data for the
10.5% Ni fits to a model where Ni is aggregated if we assume the primary
peak (q*) is observed. As the SAXS pattern arises
from a combination of the form factor (particle shape and size) and
structure factor (particle arrangement), calculations were performed
(Supporting Information) to verify that
the peak positions in the SAXS data that provide insight into the
structure factor (interparticle spacing calculated previously) for
the synthesized samples are not affected by the form factor. As shown
in the Supporting Information (Figure S7A),
the form factor for the spherical nanoparticles (taking into
account  the polydispersity) does not shift the peak position,
validating the interparticle spacing analysis carried out earlier.
On the other hand, the polydispersity of the com-Fe3O4 nanoparticles produces a form factor that does not have pronounced
peaks and therefore leads to a featureless SAXS profile for the nanocomposite
(Supporting Information, Figure S7B).

In Figures 3 and 4, the SEM–EDS images of the nanocomposites
are shown to evaluate the particle dispersity within the composite
through elemental distribution. It is believed that for the syn samples,
the particle distribution is random at low concentration, and at higher
concentrations, aggregation arises because of magnetic and electrostatic
(Hamaker constant) interactions, in accordance with the SAXS results.
The magnetic interactions should dominate the interparticle attraction,
as reported for Fe3O4 nanoparticles in solution.64 For the com samples, poor solubility results
in nonstatistical distributions. Attempts to analyze individual particle–particle
spacing were not made because of available SEM resolution limits,
sample thickness, and the inability to obtain high-resolution TEM
images of the prepared nanocomposites. In Figures 3 and 4, the EDS–SEM
images are shown for the lowest and highest composition com- and syn-Fe3O4 and Ni nanocomposites. Backscattering SEM is
available in the Supporting Information (Figure S10). Inspection of the SEM line scans and images reveals
that aggregation and sedimentation occur for all types of nanoparticles
with increasing volume fraction in the PS composites with the syn
samples showing lower aggregation behavior.

A more thorough
analysis of the dispersion of Ni in PS can be obtained
by imaging the concentration-dependent sedimentation (Figure 4). The com-Ni samples exhibit
visible aggregation (striping) at 0.62 vol %, whereas the syn-Ni sample
appears to be uniformly dispersed throughout the nanocomposite range
studied. Sedimentation within initially cast films is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S11). Multiple
possible arguments can be made for the difference in behavior including
surface passivation differences and magnetic moment differences between
the samples. For the nanocomposites, it is believed that the observed
aggregation differences in com and syn reflect primarily the difference
in magnetic moment for the samples, as evidenced by the highest magnetic
saturation sample, com-Fe3O4, exhibiting a higher
degree of aggregation than the syn-Fe3O4 sample.
This is also evident in the Ni samples where the fcc structure (com)
shows more significant aggregation than the hcp (syn) structure reflecting
their respective moments.

Dielectric Properties
The dielectric
properties of
the prepared nanocomposites were analyzed by measuring the capacitance
of the nanocomposites as a function of frequency to assess the real
(ε′) and imaginary (ε″) components of the
complex permittivity.65,66 In Figure 5, the frequency dependence of the real permittivity
(ε′) is plotted for the nanocomposites and fits in Figure 6 to the Looyenga
model. The imaginary permittivity is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S12), and the loss tangent
is plotted in Figure 7.

Real Permittivity
The real permittivity
corresponds
to the absorptive or storage ability and is observed to be frequency-dependent,
exhibiting a lower dielectric value with increasing frequency and
a positive correlation to particle volume fraction in all four nanocomposite
systems (Figure 5).
The greater increase in the ε′ for the syn-Ni system
versus the com-Ni system can be attributed to the presence of a higher
surface passivation level and the polarizable nature of OAm/TOP for
syn-Ni. It has been reported that polarizable functional groups respond
to electrical fields and enhance the measured ε′ value
at lower frequencies.67,68 In comparison, pure PS is frequency-independent
with a real (ε′) permittivity of 2.45 consistent with
reported values (2.4–2.7).17,33,69

Earlier nanocomposite studies indicate that
the dielectric properties of a nanocomposite can be fit by effective
medium theories for well-dispersed nanoparticles in the polymer.70−74 This is achieved when the nanoparticle size is on the order of polymer
entanglement regime,34,37 and the surface passivation leads
to miscibility between the phases. The developed dielectric models
can be subdivided into three categories depending on the degree of
material–material, material–host, material–field
interactions (group 1 vs group 2) and additional shape and orientation
effects (group 3).73 Dielectric models
in group 1 are used for describing the permittivity frequency response
for a noninteracting spherical filler in a matrix. We anticipated
that for our nanocomposite system that uses spherical nanoparticles
below 50 nm in a low-k host polymer matrix with low
volume fractions (<0.15), group 1 models would fit the best. When
the nanomaterials aggregate in the polymer, the dielectric properties
cannot be adequately modeled because of the inhomogeneity of the sample.

Comparison of the fits of the real permittivity data at 1 MHz to
the various effective medium models are shown in the Supporting Information (Tables S1 and S2). Inspection of the
χ2 values indicates that the analyzed group 1 and
2 models are within the statistical error. Following from the work
of Araújo et al.,73 the Looyenga
model is used for further analysis and has the lowest χ2 for the tested models. The Looyenga model does not use any
geometry assumption (shape or size) of the inclusion in the matrix
unlike other dielectric models (almost all group 1 and group 2 models
in the Supporting Information (Table S1)
including Maxwell–Garnett and Sillars and some group 3 including
the Jaysundere–Smith) and uses a “virtual sphere”
of a host matrix to which small increments of a second material with
different permittivities are added.75−77 This makes the Looyenga
model more applicable to systems where inclusion shape and size might
not be the same throughout the host matrix.75−77 Many other
effective medium models are based under the assumption of spherical
inclusions and/or a certain volume fraction (very low or very high),
which limit their application. On the basis of this information, and
from the particle distribution of the inclusions seen in the EDS elemental
mapping, the Looyenga model was anticipated to be quite applicable.
The real permittivity (ε′) is fit to the Looyenga effective
medium theory, where75−77 1  where ε′, εm′, and εf′ correspond
to the real dielectric constant of the composite, matrix, and filler,
respectively, and vf corresponds to the
volume fraction of the nanoparticle. The Looyenga model does not make
any shape assumptions for inclusions.75−77 The ε′
for the nanocomposites is fit to eq 1, as shown in Figure 6. The experimental value for vf = 0.0935 of the com-Fe3O4 (ε′
= 2.26) is below pure PS (εm′ = 2.45) and is believed to be due to
the presence of encapsulated bubbles (ε′ = 1 for air)
lowering the observed dielectric value. As such, it is treated as
an outlier but is included in the data set as it is within one standard
deviation. Form the fit, the real permittivities for the nanoparticle
filler, εf′, are 9.34 ± 1.25 (syn-Ni), 7.46 ± 0.78 (com-Ni), 4.12
± 0.16 (syn-Fe3O4), and 5.69 ± 0.65
(com-Fe3O4). The values of εf′ and χ2 for the alternative models (Supporting Information, Table S1) are available in the Supporting Information (Table S2). From the various other
models, only the group 1 and group 2 models give reasonable permittivity
values that are close to the Looyenga model results. The group 3 models
that include additional variables (see the Supporting Information, Table S1) are unable to fit accurately to the
data set for the samples. Most of the group 3 models were developed
for interacting high-k fillers loaded at high volume
fractions (≫10%) and therefore were not expected to model the
systems in this work accurately. The larger value for the Ni samples
is consistent with the metallic character of Ni and consistent with
our early analysis of Ni permittivity.78

Imaginary Permittivity
As shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S11), incorporation
of synthesized nanoparticles into PS exhibits a linear increase in
ε″ with increasing volume percentage. The imaginary component
of the dielectric for PS is negligible,79 and therefore, any change in ε″ reflects an increasing
contribution from nanoparticle absorptivity. The ε″ value
for increasing volume fraction of com-Ni and com-Fe3O4, where significant sedimentation is observed, scales nonlinearly
and can be empirically fit to a power-law behavior with n ≈ 2 (Supporting Information, Figure
S13). The empirical fit to the power law is speculated to reflect
contributions from the highly polarizable groups present in the PVP
surface passivation layer of com-Fe3O4. In this
case, the passivation layer is non-negligible, and therefore, the
ε″ value is anticipated to scale as a surface to
volume ratio with increasing volume fraction reflecting the ligand
layer and greater interfacial polarization. Further studies are underway
to evaluate the passivant-dependent contributions to the dielectric
scaling behavior.

Loss Tangent (tan δ)
In low-k applications, the ε′ (imaginary dielectric)
is an important
parameter; however, the loss tangent (tan δε = ε″/ε′) is also critical as the low-k dielectric capacitance influences the performance of the
electronic component through heating. The loss tangent, tan δε, describes how “lossy” a material is
in terms of dissipation of electrical energy. A low loss material
has a tan δε below 1.32,80 The frequency-dependent loss tangent (ε″/ε′)
for the nanocomposites is plotted in Figure 7. The nanocomposites are low loss materials
over the entire compositional range with the exception of the com-Fe3O4 nanocomposite. Both com samples exhibit the
largest frequency sensitivity. At low frequencies, the nanoparticle
ligands in the nanocomposite have sufficient time to polarize, which
is seen in the upward trend in both ε′ and ε″
as the frequency decreases to 0.1 Hz.33,81 Electrode
polarization could also have led to this observed behavior.82

FDM Filament
To evaluate potential
FDM printing compatibility,
printable filament (∼2.5 wt % from the TGA analysis of the
filament) was produced using the low magnetic syn-Ni and the strongly
magnetic com-Ni nanoparticles embedded in PS. The filament is formed
using a heated extruder to process the film three times, yielding
a fiber ready for printing applications. Although the fiber was not
used in the printer, the cross-sectional distribution of Ni in the
fiber was analyzed by SEM. As shown in Figure 8, the syn-Ni filament looks black to the
eye, whereas the com-Ni filament appears to be a lighter shade, which
arises from the better dispersity of syn-Ni versus com-Ni in the polymer.
Cross-sectional analysis of the filaments indeed shows that the overall
nanoparticle distribution is more homogeneous for syn-Ni than com-Ni
in both backscattered electron (BSE) mode and EDS mode. The application
of these fibers for FDM printed low-k insulators
in electronic architectures is underway.

Conclusions
A systematic investigation into the incorporation
of well-characterized
monodisperse nanoparticles under 50 nm (diameter) of iron oxide and
nickel into PS was carried out in this work. The results demonstrate
that the PS composite could be a viable candidate for FDM printable
materials, when the nanoparticles are uniform. The polymer nanocomposites
are observed to be well fit to the Looyenga model up to 50 wt % for
well-dispersed syn systems but fail to fit for com systems that tend
to aggregate. The agreement to the Looyenga model reflects the high
dispersity of nanoparticles in the polymer, as evidenced by the SEM–EDS
cross-sectional analysis.

The data from the current study suggest
that one can load PS with
small monodisperse nanoparticles up to 40–50% wt % (∼10
vol %) and still maintain a low-k composite system
with low losses even when using a metallic filler such as nickel.
This is possible when the materials are well formed and passivated.
Unlike certain previous work, our results show that incorporating
small nanoparticles that have higher surface area compared to micron
fillers did not lead to increased dielectric losses in the nanocomposite
even when a metallic nickel filler was used. The dielectric components
(ε′ and ε″) for the nanocomposite decreased
with increasing frequency before reaching a constant value excluding
the syn-Ni nanocomposite at the highest volume fraction. As a proof
of principle, nanocomposite filaments amenable to FDM printing were
produced and shown to maintain their nanoparticle dispersions.

The low loss behavior for the nanocomposites over a wide frequency
range for the syn metallic and metal oxide fillers having small sizes
and tight size distributions loaded up to physically attainable limits
(∼50 wt %) was surprising. In comparison to the literature,
all the syn materials show better performance. The observation of
better performance when synthetically prepared materials with well-defined
size, size dispersity, and surface passivated nanoparticles 
are used as polymer fillers should provide parameters for preparing
nanocomposites for FDM printed technologies.

Synthesis of
Nanoparticles
syn Iron Oxide (syn-Fe3O4)
Spherical
magnetite (11 ± 0.9 nm) nanoparticles passivated by OA/OAm were
synthesized by following a previously established route.83 In brief, 500 mg (0.00142 mol) of Fe-acac was
dissolved in 18 mL (0.0547 mol) of OAm and 20 mL (0.0628 mol) of OAc.
The solution was heated to 180 °C, and 2 mL (0.0225 mol) of n-methylpyrrole was rapidly injected. The temperature was
held at 180 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature.
To isolate Fe3O4 from the reaction mixture,
MeOH was added until the solution became opaque, and the resultant
nanoparticles were removed by applying a magnetic field. The magnetically
separated Fe3O4 nanoparticles were redispersed
in toluene, reprecipitated by the addition of MeOH, and dried under
vacuum.

syn Nickel Nanoparticles (syn-NiNPs)
Spherical hcp-Ni
(20 nm) nanoparticles, passivated by TOP, were prepared by combining
3.0 g (0.012 mol) of nickel acetate, 72 mL (0.23 mol) of 1-ODE, and
12 mL (0.036 mol) of OAm added to a 250 mL round-bottom flask. The
solution was degassed under vacuum at 110 °C until no gas evolution
was observed and back-filled with N2. To the solution,
5.4 mL (0.012 mol) of TOP was added, and the temperature of contents
increased to 245 °C. NiNPs were observed to begin forming in
solution at 200 °C as observed by the solution color turning
black. When the temperature reached 245 °C, the contents were
removed from the heating mantle and immediately cooled to room temperature.
The reaction was poured into a centrifuge tube, and the nickel nanoparticles
were precipitated by the addition of 10 mL toluene, followed by 30
mL of MeOH. The resulting solution was centrifuged for 5 min. After
removing the supernatant, the pellet was redispersed in toluene. To
precipitate the NiNPs, excess MeOH was added, followed by isolation
through centrifugation before drying under vacuum.

Nanoparticle–PS
Composites
The nanoparticle–polymer
composites were prepared with particle loadings between 0 and 15 vol
% (Table 1) by blending
chloroform dispersed PS and nanoparticles dispersed in chloroform
with the assistance of sonication at 40 °C. The polymer composite
is formed by slow solvent evaporation to form a viscous solution,
cast onto a flat glass surface to form a film, and then further dried
under vacuum for 24 h. To minimize bubble formation in the cured nanopolymer
composite film during the vacuum drying step, a multistep drying procedure
is followed, wherein initially the sample is heated using an oven
from 25 to 80 °C (10 °C/h) over 6 h, held at 80 °C
for 12 h, followed by vacuum drying at 110 °C for 12 h to fully
cure the polymer composite. To ensure adequate material for dielectric
measurements and cross-sectional analysis by SEM imaging, an 8 mm
× 1 mm disk is formed from the above nanoparticle–polymer
film by punching 5/16th in. disks from the polymer composite, stacking
four disks, and hot pressing in an aluminum mold at 185 °C at
a force of 15 000 pounds for 10 min.

Filament Formation
A low volume fraction printable
filament for the syn-Ni and com-Ni samples was prepared by extruding
precast and dried nanocomposite films using a Filabot EX2 Filament
Extruder operating at 220 °C. The extruded filament was broken
up and extruded 3 times to improve homogeneity.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Nanoparticle samples
were drop-cast, from toluene dispersion, onto 300 mesh carbon-coated
copper grids and left to dry under vacuum overnight. The TEM images
were recorded using a JEM-ARM200cF electron microscope at a 200 kV
acceleration voltage.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM–EDS
imaging
analysis of cross sections of the composite cast film, pressed disks
and extruded filament was performed on cleaved samples mounted onto
a carbon tape and placed on 45°/90° (Ted Pella 16104) low
profile aluminum mount to allow cross-sectional imaging. The mounted
samples were carbon-coated (4 nm) using a Balzers Mini deposition
system MED 010 prior to SEM imaging to prevent charging. SEM imaging
was performed on a FEI Nova NanoSEM 400 operating at 20 kV with a
spot size of 4.0. The images were collected with an Everhart–Thornley
detector (ETD), a BSE detector, or an Oxford INCA X-Sight EDS detector.
The BSE mode and EDS mapping were used to identify the dispersion
of nanoparticles within the polymer for the lowest and highest volume
fractions of nanoparticles.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
TGA was
performed on a TA
Instruments Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer. The samples were heated
at a rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 100 °C and
held for 5 min before continuing to ramp at 10 °C/min to 550
°C. Measurements were performed under nitrogen to prevent further
oxidation.

Magnetic Measurements
Magnetic properties
were studied
with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer,
MPMS-XL (Quantum Design). Field-dependent magnetization was measured
at 300 K, with the applied field varying from 0 to 1 T and back.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
Measurements
were carried out at the highest loading levels for the nanocomposite
using a TA Q250 calorimeter. The samples were subjected to a heat/cool/heat
experimental procedure: ramp at 10 °C/min to 300.00 °C;
ramp at 10 °C/min to 50.00 °C; and ramp at 10 °C/min
to 300.00 °C.

Dielectric Spectroscopy
The dielectric
spectroscopy
was performed on the composite disks (8 mm × 1 mm) on a Novocontrol
impedance dielectric spectrometer (Rohde & Schwarz ZVA), and a
parallel-plate geometry and an Alpha-A modular analyzer were utilized
to calculate the capacitance and conductivity of each sample. WinDETA
software provided the calibration protocols and experimentation setup.
The measurements were taken at 1.5 V, for each frequency, and averaged
three times for each data point. Measurements were taken over 10 Hz
steps over the frequency range chosen.

Powder X-ray Diffraction
The pXRD patterns for Ni nanoparticles
and for all volume percent nanocomposites were acquired on a Rigaku
Ultima III diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα source. Because
of the presence of Fe fluorescence, the Fe3O4 composites were analyzed on a PANalyticial X’pert Pro (Cu
Kα source with a filter for the removal of iron fluorescence).
Data were collected at room temperature in the 2θ range of 10–80°.

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
SAXS measurements were
performed between 0.1 and 3.7° (2θ) in transmission mode
on 8 mm × 1 mm disks of the nanocomposite using a Bruker Nanostar
instrument with a Cu Kα source (λ = 0.154 nm). The sample
was placed in an aluminum sample holder. Intensity versus scattering
vector (q) plots, where q = 4π/λ
sin(θ), were generated by integrating over a 1 mm × 1 mm
area of the detector (600 s averaging time).
