A two-step technology
using nontoxic and eco-friendly chemicals
is developed for the durable setting of densely/highly crosslinked
proteins, such as wool and hair. Currently, most technologies for
morphological modification are effective only for materials from non-highly-crosslinked
proteins and cellulose. Before their morphological change, only water
is needed to interrupt hydrogen bonds and ionic linkages, which stabilize
the relative positions of molecules in non-highly-crosslinked proteins
and cellulose. However, highly crosslinked proteins contain disulfide
crosslinks, which are insusceptible to water. Thus, the controlled
cleavage of disulfide bonds is required for creating new morphologies
of highly crosslinked protein materials, such as hair and wool. Herein,
cysteine and citric acid (CA) were used for the two-step setting of
highly crosslinked proteins. This recipe showed better morphological
change and less mechanical loss than commercial hair styling products.
A reaction between CA and keratin was proposed, and verified via NMR
and Raman spectra and titration. This technology could be a prospective
alternative to achieve durable hair setting, anticrease finishing
of wool textiles, and other durable morphological changes needed for
highly crosslinked proteins.

==== Body
Introduction
The durable or semidurable
setting of natural macromolecules, as
an effective approach to modify the appearance and performance properties
of macromolecular materials, has been a topic attracting growing attention
from both academic and industrial scientists.1,2 For
example, in the textile industry, cotton, silk, and wool textiles
should be set for antiwrinkle or durable-press effects;3 and in the cosmetic industry, hair should be
set for durable and semidurable styling purposes.

Currently,
most processing technologies targeting durable or semidurable
morphological changes are effective for materials based on non-highly-crosslinked
proteins and cellulose, but not for materials based on highly/densely
crosslinked proteins. The difference stems from the disparity between
their molecular structures. To ensure the newly formed morphologies
are durable, intermolecular interactions between the molecules in
the original proteinous or cellulosic materials should be disrupted.
In non-highly-crosslinked proteins and cellulose, hydrogen bonds and
ionic linkages stabilize intermolecular positions, and can be easily
interrupted by water molecules.4 However,
in highly crosslinked proteins, disulfide bonds that dominate the
intermolecular interactions are insusceptible to water,5 and thus render conventional setting methods
for non-highly-crosslinked proteins and cellulose ineffective. Without
breaking the strong internal disulfide crosslinks among keratin molecules,
new morphologies could not be effectively formed by merely applying
external crosslinks. Therefore, the controlled cleavage of disulfide
bonds became the premise of effective setting of new morphologies
of highly crosslinked protein materials.6 So far, not much work has been reported on the high-efficiency setting
of wool textiles or human/animal hair using only crosslinking steps
under mild conditions. Hair setting was taken as a typical example
to verify the effectiveness of the two-step process. In the first
step, hair was chemically reduced by reductants, typically thioglycolates,
to break the intermolecular disulfide bonds, rendering the keratin
molecules capable of sliding by each other.7 In the second step, the reduced hair was treated with hydrogen peroxide
to rebuild the broken disulfide bonds, or formaldehyde to crosslink
the keratin molecules in their new positions, to set the designated
hair styles.

However, these chemicals are usually toxic or environmentally
hazardous,
and could easily contact the scalp during operation. Thioglycolates,
including acetate thioglycolate and ammonium thioglycolate, usually
at around 8% in the first step perming solution,5 are toxic, carcinogenic, erosive, and flammable with potential
to generate poisonous hydrogen sulfide gas.8,9 A
number of occupational health problems, especially the impairment
of reproductive systems, have increasingly been reported.10 Hydrogen peroxide for hair setting could cause
irritation to eyes, skin, throat, and respiratory airway.11 Moreover, formaldehyde was usually used at concentrations
higher than the allowed upper limit,12,13 and has caused
the most occupational health problems worldwide.14−16

Therefore,
safer and greener chemicals are needed for hair setting
and other treatment for highly crosslinked proteins. Cysteine and
citric acid (CA) could be optimal candidates for the first-step cleavage
of disulfide bonds and second-step rebuilding of new disulfide bonds,
respectively, for stabilization of new morphology. Cysteine is a standard
amino acid with a thiol group, and thus, has strong reducibility.17 Application of the environmentally friendly
reductant could meet the requirements for sustainable development
of material industry.18 CA is fermented
from corn or potato starch on an industrial scale.19 More than 66% of the production of CA is used in beverages
and food processing, indicating the general safety of CA.20

Cysteine has shown effectiveness in reducing
the disulfide bonds
in hair keratin21 in the first step of
hair styling. However, in some research, cysteine was reported to
be less effective than thioglycolic acid for hair perming, due to
poorer penetration into the hair cortex.22,23 However, it could be assumed that with slower reaction with hair,
the loss of hair strength as a side effect of the reduction could
be better controlled. Furthermore, as has been proven, with extra
swelling of hair, cysteine reduction could substantially enhance the
reduction efficiency,24 and subsequently,
setting efficiency.25

Nontoxic CA
crosslinking has the potential to be used in the second
step of hair styling to rebuild the disulfide bonds at new positions
to restore the mechanical robustness of hair.26,27 CA crosslinking of protein fibers and protein nanoparticles remarkably
improved the linkages improving the performance properties, such as
the tensile properties and water stability.28−30 Furthermore,
in vitro assessment proved that the CA crosslinking of proteins is
cytocompatible.31 However, to the best
of our knowledge, there has been no report regarding the crosslinking
of hair keratin using CA for durable hair styling.

In this research,
green and nontoxic chemicals, cysteine as a reductant
combined with swelling agent urea, were used for reduction, and CA
subsequently was used for crosslinking in hair setting. The setting
efficiency, as well as the dry and wet tensile properties of hair
treated with the nontoxic approach were compared with those of hair
treated with commercial products. Reduction and crosslinking were
quantitatively analyzed via titration to verify their occurrence.
The reaction between CA and hair keratin was characterized by NMR
and Raman spectroscopy.

Results and Discussion
Reaction Mechanism and
Crosslinking Degree
The detailed
reaction steps of the reduction of hair keratin using cysteine and
the crosslinking between hair keratin and CA are demonstrated in Figure 1. As shown in step
1, the −SH in cysteine exchanged with the −S–S–
in keratin and weakened the interaction among the keratin, thus rendering
the keratin molecules capable of sliding alongside each other.

Figure 1 Scheme of hair
setting reactions, including reduction of hair and
crosslinking between hair and CA.

After endowing new shapes to the reduced hair, CA was added
to
create new intermolecular bonds and fix the new morphology of the
hair. The possible reaction steps between CA and hair keratin catalyzed
with SHP are shown in step 2. Under temperatures as high as 180 °C,
two carboxyl groups could react to form an anhydride, releasing one
molecule of water. Subsequently, acylation between the anhydride and
SHP produces a molecule of intermediate (1), which could be substituted
by nucleophilic groups, such as −OH, −SH, and −NH2, in the reduced keratin, generating an ester group (2) and
releasing a molecule of SHP and a carboxyl group in the CA. Till now,
one carboxyl group in the CA has formed an ester group with hair keratin
and two are still available for reaction. The two carboxyl groups
could again form another ester group with another nucleophilic group
in the same keratin molecule or another keratin molecule. The reactions
lead to intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinking. Regarding
that in one CA molecule, only one carboxyl group participates in the
reaction with keratin, the two other free carboxyl groups and the
hydroxyl groups could then form hydrogen bonds with amine groups,
hydrogen groups, and carboxyl groups in keratin molecules to enhance
the intermolecular or intramolecular interactions. The newly formed
ester groups are stable, whereas the hydrogen bonds might be easily
destroyed under wet conditions.

NMR
Figure 2 shows the NMR spectra of the
original hair, air oxidized
hair, and hair crosslinked with CA with concentrations of 5, 10, 20,
and 30%. All of the CA crosslinked hair had obvious peaks at 74 ppm,
indicating the presence of carbon atoms, which are connected to the
hydroxyl groups in the CA molecules,3 whereas
the original hair and air oxidized hair did not. The difference suggests
the occurrence of a reaction between the hair and CA in the treated
hair. The peaks between 170 and 180 ppm representing carbonyl groups
in keratin existed in all of the groups of hair.34 However, among all of the sample groups, there was no significant
difference in the intensity of the carbonyl peak. This could be because,
compared to the number of carbonyl groups in original hair keratin,
the amount of carbonyl groups increased due to reacted CA molecules
was negligible.

Figure 2 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of original hair, CA-0%
group
(air oxidized hair, hair treated under the same conditions without
using CA), and hair crosslinked with 5, 10, 20, and 30% CA (reduction:
5% cysteine based on the weight of hair, 2 M urea, pH 9.5; crosslinking:
180 °C, 4 min).

Raman Spectra
In Figure 3, the peak at around 650 cm–1, indicating
formation of thioester group (−COS−),35−37 existed only
in the spectra of hair crosslinked with CA at concentrations of 5–30%,
but not in that of original hair and air oxidized hair. It could be
inferred that the −COOH groups in CA reacted with the −SH
groups in reduced hair keratin. Moreover, the peak at around 1000
cm–1,21,38,39 representing cysteine-S-sulfonate bonds (−S–O−)
most probably in cysteic acid, could be observed in the 5–30%
CA crosslinked hair cortex spectra, and not in that of the cortex
of untreated and 0% CA treated hair. This sulfur–oxygen bond
was also formed via oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in reduced keratin.
Both peaks of 650 and 1000 cm–1 inferred that crosslinking
with CA might boost oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. However, the mechanism
remains unclear.

fiber surface)
of original hair, CA-0% group (air oxidized hair, hair treated under
the same conditions without using CA), and hair crosslinked with 5,
10, 20, and 30% CA (reduction: 5% cysteine based on the weight of
hair, 2 M urea, pH 9.5; crosslinking: 180 °C, 4 min). The dot
lines indicating peaks at around 1000 and 650 cm–1 represent the cysteine-S-sulfonate bonds (−S–O−)
and thioester groups (−COS−), respectively.

Efficiency of Nontoxic Hair Setting
Hair is composed
of about 80% keratin. The morphology of hair is stabilized due to
fixation of the relative positions of keratin molecules by disulfide
crosslinking, which is attributed to the existence of about 18% of
cysteine in its amino acid composition.5 To modify the morphology of hair, disulfide bonds should be cleaved
to allow keratin molecules to slide alongside each other under external
force. After new shapes are induced, the intermolecular interactions
among keratin should be re-established.

All chemicals employed
in the reduction and crosslinking for hair perming were nontoxic.
In the first step, urea was used to break the hydrogen bonds, salt
linkages, and Van der Waal’s force, thus swelling the hair
with tight structures. Under this circumstance, the reductant, cysteine,
could penetrate the interior of the hair. With pH adjusted to about
9, cysteine has a strong reducing capability, and could effectively
break the disulfide bonds throughout the entire hair. In the second
step, new covalent bonds between carboxylic groups in CA and functional
groups, such as amine groups, hydroxyl groups, and thiol groups in
keratin could be created. Consequently, the keratin molecules in their
new positions, and subsequently, the new morphologies of hair were
stabilized.

Figure 4 demonstrates
the effect of the concentration of CA on perming efficiency (PE) after
using the green approach, and comparison with commercial perming product.
The average PE increased remarkably from 5 to 60% as the concentration
of CA increased from 0 to 20%, but did not increase as the concentration
of CA increased to 30%. CA-0% groups indicate that the hair was oxidized
in air and no external crosslinking was applied. The commercial product
using hydrogen peroxide oxidation led to a PE of 45%, similar to the
result of perming using 10% CA in crosslinking.

Figure 4 Effect of CA concentration
on PE using CA as the crosslinking agent
in the second step. A commercial perming product with the highest
PE among 10 was selected as the control. A CA-0% group (air oxidized
hair, hair treated under the same conditions without using CA) (reduction:
5% cysteine based on the weight of hair, 2 M urea, pH 9.5; crosslinking:
180 °C, 4 min. Commercial products were applied following the
suppliers’ instructions.) Above each bar, different letters
“a”–“d” are labeled to indicate
significant differences among the data points.

The perming results were highly affected by the amounts of
functional
groups that participated in building new covalent bonds during crosslinking
or oxidation. When the CA concentration was 0, only oxygen in the
air could oxidize the sulfhydryl groups into disulfide bonds. However,
the oxidation was insufficient to transform all of the sulfhydryl
groups. By introducing CA in the second step of hair perming, extra
connections among keratin molecules via re-formation of the thioester,
ester, and amino groups between −COOH groups in CA and the
−NH2, −OH, and −SH groups of reduced
keratin, in addition to the disulfide bonds formed due to air oxidation.
The maximum PE% reached at a CA concentration of 20% might be due
to occupation of all of the functional groups in keratin molecules,
rendering further addition of CA into the system ineffective. Changes
in the amount of the functional groups −COOH, −SH, and
−NH2 were quantified to verify this assumption.

Mechanical Properties of Hair Fibers after Perming
Figure 5 shows that
with similar PE, the % retention of dry and wet tensile strength and
strain of hair treated by the commercial product were both lower than
that of hair treated by 10% CA. The better retained mechanical properties
of hair could be due to the more effective recovery of intermolecular
interactions induced by CA crosslinking, compared to hydrogen peroxide
oxidation. Figure 5 also demonstrates that the average % retention of dry and wet tensile
strength increased remarkably from 34 to 77% and from 24 to 67%, respectively,
as the concentration of CA increased from 0 to 20%, and then decreased
to 60 and 59%, respectively, as the concentration of CA increased
to 30%. The average % retention of dry and wet tensile strain increased
remarkably from 32 to 126% and from 36 to 130%, respectively, as the
concentration of CA increased from 0 to 20%, and then decreased to
101 and 105%, respectively, as the concentration of CA increased to
30%. Compared to the dry state, wet tensile strength was always lower,
whereas wet tensile strain was always higher. The difference between
dry and wet hair was acceptable, and was attributed to interruption
of the hydrogen bonds among the keratin backbones by water molecules.

2 M urea, pH 9.5; crosslinking: 180 °C, 4 min). Above each bar,
different letters a–f and A–E are labeled to indicate
significant differences among the data points.

The tensile strength and strain of hair decreased and could
not
fully recover after the cleavage of the disulfide bonds. Rebuilding
of the disulfide bonds and other intermolecular forces by either oxidation
or crosslinking could recover the tensile properties of hair with
variable recovery extents. Air oxidation played a major role when
0% CA was used in the second step of perming. The resultant % retention
of tensile properties was low due to a low re-establishment of crosslinking.
As more CA was added for hair perming, additional intermolecular bonds,
including thioester, ester, and amino groups between −COOH
groups were formed in CA and −NH2, −OH, and
−SH groups in reduced keratin. Therefore, the tensile properties
of the hair fibers could be more effectively recovered. However, a
further increase in CA concentration to 30% decreased the tensile
strength and strain due to over-crosslinking.40

To verify the reduction and crosslinking reactions, and effect
of crosslinking on the PE, the changes in the amounts of −SH,
−NH2, and −COOH on hair keratin are shown
below. However, due to limitations of the characterization approaches,
change in the −OH amount, which was also important for the
reaction, was not measured in this research.

Change in the Amounts of
Functional Groups in Hair before and
after Setting
In Figure 6, the concentration of sulfhydryl groups in hair increased
from 17 μmol g–1 to nearly 238 μmol
g–1 after reduction using cysteine. With cysteine
reduction and air oxidation (CA-0%), the −SH concentration
significantly decreased to 168 μmol g–1. Oxygen
in the air oxidized about 30% of the total sulfhydryl groups into
disulfide groups. The corresponding PE, percentage retention of tensile
strength, and percentage retention of tensile elongation were 5, 34,
and 36%, respectively. The insufficient perming effectiveness was
due to the insufficient reconnection of disulfide bonds of air oxidation.

Figure 6 Concentration
of sulfhydryl group (−SH) in untreated hair,
CA-0% group (air oxidized hair, hair treated under the same conditions
without using CA), and hair permed with 5, 10, 20, and 30% CA. Above
each bar, different letters a–g are labeled to indicate significant
differences among the data points.

By increasing the CA concentration to 30%, the −SH
concentration
gradually and remarkably dropped to 22 μmol g–1 (20% CA) and 19 μmol g–1 (30% CA), which
is very close to the amount of −SH in the untreated hair. The
corresponding PE, % retention of tensile strength, and % retention
of tensile elongation increased to 59, 77, and 126%, respectively.
It could be inferred that with the addition of 20% or more CA, a majority
of −SH groups generated from cysteine reduction could participate
in the reactions. The results verified that reconnection of intermolecular
linkages induced by CA crosslinking played a major role in the setting
of hair.

Figure 7 indicates
that as the CA concentration increased, the amount of carboxyl groups
in the hair gradually increased from 5 to 32 mmol g–1. Not all three carboxyl groups in one CA molecule could react with
the functional groups in keratin due to steric hindrance, leaving
two or one carboxyl groups unreacted. Figure 4B shows the amount of amine groups gradually
decreased from 1.6 to 0.7 mmol g–1.

Figure 7 Concentration of −COOH
and −NH2 in untreated
and CA crosslinked hair samples. CA-0% group (air oxidized hair, hair
treated under the same conditions without using CA) (reduction: 5%
cysteine based on the weight of hair, 2 M urea, pH 9.5; crosslinking:
180 °C, 4 min). Different letters a–e and A–D are
labeled to indicate significant differences among the data points.

When the CA concentration was
0, the amount of carboxyl and amine
groups did not change significantly, as shown in Figure 7. It could be inferred that
the amine groups did not participate in the reactions of reduction
and air oxidation, and the perming effect could be attributed only
to the re-formation of disulfide bonds. As the CA concentration increased,
the acylation reaction between amine groups and carboxyl groups led
to a decrease in the amount of amine groups. When the CA concentration
was 5, 10, and 20%, about 25, 44, and 56% of amine groups participated
in the reaction, resulting in perming efficiencies of 27, 45, and
59%, respectively. As the concentration of CA further increased to
30%, the PE did not increase, probably because all of the amine groups
capable of reacting with carboxyl groups in CA were consumed.

Application
of the Nontoxic Hair Styling Product for Hair Straightening
High efficiency in straightening and good retention of mechanical
properties of hair could also be observed when using the same nontoxic
cysteine/CA hair styling product to straighten natural curly hair. Table 1 demonstrates that
the straightening efficiency % and retention of mechanical properties
of natural curly hair using the nontoxic cysteine/CA hair styling
product were better, compared with the best of the 10 commercial hair
straightening products. The commercial product used a relaxer in the
first step and neutralizer in the second step of hair straightening.
The alkaline solution used in the first step had a pH at around 13
and caused hydrolysis of the keratin backbones as well as disulfide
bonds. The neutralization in the second step could mainly help rebuild
the disulfide bonds. On the other hand, in the nontoxic cysteine/CA
formula, the keratin backbones were not as severely damaged due to
the much lower pH in the first step. In addition to the rebuilding
of the disulfide bonds, CA could effectively react with −SH,
−OH, −COOH, and −NH2 groups in the
keratin, leading to more durable straightening results and stronger
hair fibers.

Conclusions
To manipulate highly crosslinked proteins, cysteine and CA, two
naturally occurring chemicals that could be fermented from dextrose
and starch, respectively, were used for the reduction and crosslinking
of proteins, respectively. Hair styling was used as an example of
setting of highly-crosslinked proteins. Cysteine was effective in
breaking the disulfide bonds, and this was indicated by the significantly
increased amount of sulfhydryl groups after reduction. CA was efficient
in crosslinking keratin, which was indicated by the changes in the
amounts of −SH, −COOH, and −NH2 groups.
The reaction between CA and hair was verified using solid-state NMR.
The peak at 74 ppm only present in the spectra of the CA crosslinked
hair indicated a carbon atom connecting with the hydroxyl group in
CA. The Raman spectra of CA crosslinked hair also showed peaks at
650 cm–1, representing thioester groups, which formed
between the −SH groups in the reduced hair and −COOH
groups in CA. Compared to the commercial products using hazardous
chemicals, our technology showed higher curling/straightening efficiencies
and better retention of mechanical properties of hair. In summary,
this two-step technology could be promising for achieving durable
hair setting, anticrease finishing of wool textiles, and other morphological
changes for highly crosslinked proteins.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Long straight hair with a length of around
30 cm was collected from a 30 year old Asian female. Natural curly
hair with length of around 20 cm was collected from a 50 year old
African American female. Cysteine, sodium carbonate, CA, sodium hypophosphite
(SHP), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and glycerol were purchased
from EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ. Urea was purchased from Oak
Chemical, Inc., West Columbia, SC. 5,5′-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB) was purchased from G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO. The
purity of the chemicals was considered in all the calculations of
concentrations. SHP is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the FDA
and has been used as a food additive for decades.41,42 Cysteine is safe and has been widely used in personal care products,
including cosmetics, for decades.43,44 Urea has been
accepted as an effective swelling agent for keratin materials.45,46

Hair Setting
Before setting, the hair was shampooed,
rinsed, and dried. Hair setting included two steps, swelling/reduction
and crosslinking. The straight hair was rolled up onto a glass rod
to obtain curls. In the first reduction step, the hair was treated
with an aqueous reduction solution composed of 10% of the freshly
prepared cysteine solution in 2 M urea solution with pH adjusted to
9.5 using sodium carbonate. The use of 2 M urea solution was selected
after careful initial experiments. Using a higher concentration of
urea caused the hair to be destroyed easily due to accidentally prolonging
step 1; while using a lower concentration meant the hair could not
be effectively swollen to facilitate the necessary reduction of disulfide
bonds in the interior hair fibers, leading to ineffective perming
of the hair (data not shown). The reduced hair was rinsed with distilled
water three times at an infinite liquor ratio at room temperature,
and then heated at 80 °C until the weight became constant. The
crosslinking agent containing 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt % CA was prepared
with SHP at 50 wt % CA. The hair on the rod was soaked in the crosslinking
solution and oscillated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The hair
was dried at 80 °C for 10 min. The soak–dry procedure
was repeated several times until the weight became constant. The final
pick-up of crosslinking solution on the hair was controlled in the
range of 90–100 wt %, based on the dry weight of the hair bundle.
At last, the hair bundles were heated at 180 °C for 4 min to
conduct the crosslinking. Straightening followed the same procedures
and recipes, except that the hair was straightened under tension instead
of curled on rods.

PE was calculated based on the change in
hair length before and after perming treatment, as shown in eq 1. 1  After curling or straightening,
the hair was rinsed in distilled water at room temperature three times,
wiped with a paper towel to remove free water, and dried under the
environmental conditions of 21 °C and 65% relative humidity for
at least 24 h before any measurement or testing. Hair perming and
straightening basically used the same procedures. Using the nontoxic
cysteine and CA, perming of straight hair was discussed in detail,
followed by the straightening results of naturally curly hair.

Tensile
Properties
The fineness of the hair fibers
was measured in terms of denier, which is the weight of 9000 m of
fibers in grams. The weight of known lengths of hair fibers was measured
to calculate the denier of the fibers. Before testing the dry tensile
properties, the hair was first conditioned to determine the wet tensile
properties, the hair was soaked in water for at least 30 min before
testing. The tensile properties of the fibers in terms of breaking
tenacity and breaking elongation were tested using an Instron tensile
testing machine (model 4400; Norwood, MA) according to ASTM standard
D-3822. In the test, a gauge length of 1 in. and crosshead speed of
18 mm min–1 were used. For each condition, about
30 specimens were tested for each fiber sample. The wet strength of
keratin fibers was determined immediately after immersing the fibers
in water at room temperature for 30 min.

Titration of Sulfhydryl
Groups, Carboxyl Groups, and Amine Groups
To verify the reaction
between hair keratin and CA, the change
in the amounts of −SH, −COOH, and −NH2 groups was determined using titration. A solid-phase assay for total
thiol group content was carried out according to the colorimetric
reaction method described by Yoshimizu et al.32 About 30 mg of ground hair was suspended in 1.0 mL of reaction buffer
consisting of 8 M urea, 10 mM DTNB, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.2 M Tris–HCl,
pH 8.0. Samples were incubated at room temperature in a N2 atmosphere for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 9000 rcf for 10 min.
The absorbance of the supernatant at 412 nm was determined using a
UV/vis spectrophotometer (model DU 720; Beckman Coulter Inc. Brea,
CA). The concentration of thiol groups was calculated based on eq 2. Three replica experiments
were conducted for each data point. 2  wherein A is the value of
absorbance, V is the volume of reaction buffer, and m is the weight of hair samples.

Based on our previous
study,33 carboxyl group and amino group
content in the hair sample were determined via titration using a Mettler
Toledo SevenMulti S47 pH/conductivity meter equipped with an Inlab
Expert Pro electrode and an Inlab 730 probe for pH and conductivity
measurements, respectively (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH). About 1
g of ground and delipidized crosslinked and original hair sample was
precisely weighed, and dispersed in 20 mL of standardized 0.05 mol
L–1 HCl, in which the carboxylic and amino groups
in the hair sample were protonated. Standardized 0.05 mol L–1 NaOH solution was used. Conductivity and pH values were recorded
after addition of about 0.2 mL NaOH solution each time. Three replica
experiments were conducted for each data point.

Raman and NMR
Spectra
Raman and solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy
were used to detect new groups to verify the occurrence
of a reaction between hair keratin and CA. The hair samples were embedded
in epoxy resin, cured, and then microtomed to a thickness of 1.5 μm,
and mounted on slide glasses. All Raman spectra were recorded 20 μm
under the surface of hair on a Raman spectroscope (inVia H 18415;
Renishaw, Illinois, IL). The laser excitation was provided by an argon
ion laser at a cross slit of 100–200 μm with a power
of 30–50 mW at a wavelength of 632 nm. Solid-state 13C NMR was performed on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer (Bruker
BioSpin, Billerica, MA). Each keratin sample was scanned for 8 h to
obtain good signals.

Statistical Analysis
All of the
data points were compared
using the one-way analysis of variance with the Scheffé test
with a confidence interval of 95%. A p value smaller
than 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. Standard
deviations are shown by the error bars in the figures, and the data
in the figures labeled with different numbers or characters indicate
significant differences among them.
