We
present aptamer-based sensing using a coupled acoustic-gravitational
(CAG) field, which transduces a change in the density of a microparticle
(MP) to a change in the levitation coordinate. A large density of
the MP is initially induced by the binding of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
on the MP through sandwich hybridization with aptamer DNA molecules.
Targets added to the system interact with the aptamer DNA molecules
to form complexes, and the duplex between the aptamer and the probe
DNA molecules is dissociated. This leads to the release of AuNPs from
the MP and a decrease in its density. As the target concentration
increases, the levitation coordinate of the MP increases. From the
levitation coordinate shift, we can determine the target concentration.
The detection limits for adenosine triphosphate, dopamine, and ampicillin
as test targets are 9.8 nM, 17 nM, and 160 pM, respectively. The dissociation
constants for the aptamer–target complexes are quantitatively
determined from the dependence of the levitation coordinate on the
target concentration. This scheme is a useful analytical tool not
only for the trace analyses of targets but also for the evaluation
of aptamer–target interactions.

Introduction
Aptamers, which are
single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules comprising
10–100 nucleotides, can selectively bind targets such as metal
ions, small organic molecules, peptides, proteins, and cells with
high affinity and specificity. Aptamers are mostly identified by in
vitro selections, that is, the systematic evolution of ligands by
exponential enrichment (SELEX). Aptamers allow versatile designs of
efficient analytical methods, which have many advantages over antibody-based
systems, for example, high thermal stability, ease of handling and
synthesis, low immunogenicity, low toxicity, and reusability.1−5 For these reasons, aptamers have received much attention in various
fields such as clinical diagnosis, forensics, food safety, and environmental
science, and various bioanalytical schemes have been proposed based
on aptamer chemistry.

Aptamer-based sensing often utilizes the
conformation changes of
aptamer molecules, which can be classified into simple binding, folding,
and structure switching.5 In the simple
binding methods, the binding between aptamers and targets is detected
in the form of changes in electrochemical signals, fluorescence intensity,
mass, and refractive index.6−8 The aptamer folding is modified
by the formation of an aptamer–target complex, which changes,
for example, the fluorescence intensity.9,10 Stojanovic
et al. reported a fluorescence sensor for cocaine using aptamer folding.11 In this method, the ends of the aptamer molecules
were labeled with a fluorophore and quencher. Whereas the fluorescence
signal was observed in the absence of cocaine because the fluorophore
and quencher were located apart, the fluorescence decreased in the
presence of cocaine because the aptamer folding owing to the cocaine
complex formation forced the fluorophore and quencher to come together.
However, this detection scheme is limited to the cases where the head–tail
contact of the aptamer is induced by its complexation. In contrast,
structure switching, which uses the duplex dissociation between the
aptamer and complementary DNA by the interaction of the aptamer with
the target, allows more versatile designs of biosensing.6,12,13 Lu et al., for example, proposed
a detection scheme for human thrombin using this approach and demonstrated
a detection limit at the nanomolar (nM) level.14 Graphene oxide, which acts as a fluorescence quencher,
effectively adsorbs single-strand aptamer DNA. The complexation of
a target with the aptamer causes the desorption of the aptamer from
the graphene oxide surface. This entire process enhances fluorescence.
Structure switching also involves the duplex dissociation between
the aptamer and complementary DNA molecules in the presence of a target.
This approach was applied to various detection schemes also.

The schematic design and sensitivity of aptamer-based sensors largely
rely on the stability of the aptamer–target complex. A number
of methods have been developed for the determination of the dissociation
constants (Kd) of aptamer–target
complexes, which include surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and electrophoresis.15−18 Win et al. determined the Kd values
for the codeine–aptamer complexes using a direct coupling SPR
assay.19 Two most stable aptamers, with Kd = 2.50 and 4.00 μM, were found from
the sequences generated using an iterative in vitro selection process.
Lee et al. reported an aptamer DNA-based SPR biosensor for the retinol
binding protein 4 (RBP4).20 The label-free
RBP4 detection was performed using SPR with an aptamer-immobilized
gold chip. Gong et al. reported the determination of Kd for a thrombin–aptamer complex using microchip
capillary electrophoresis, in which the peak ratio of free and bound
aptamers is used to obtain Kd.21

We demonstrated the label-free sensing
of DNA and microRNA molecules
based on the levitation coordinate shifts of a single microparticle
(MP) in a combined acoustic–gravitational (CAG) field.22,23 MPs are levitated in the CAG field at different coordinates according
to their acoustic properties (density and compressibility). The density
change of the MP, which was induced by the binding of gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) through DNA or RNA sandwich hybridization, caused the levitation
coordinate shifts of the MP in the CAG field.22,23 This method allowed the zeptomole (zmol) detection of DNA and microRNA.
We also evaluated the kinetics involved in the avidin–biotin
reaction in the CAG field.24 Thus, this
approach is efficient not only for highly responsive sensing applications
but also for the evaluation of the reaction involved in detection
schemes. The utilization of aptamers is expected to enhance the usefulness
of this method and significantly extend its applicability. In this
paper, we propose a highly versatile detection scheme based on the
MP levitation in a CAG field using aptamer DNA molecules. Aptamer
DNA mediates the binding between an MP and AuNPs through sandwich
hybridization. The interaction between the target and aptamer induces
the dissociation of the duplex, and AuNPs are released from the MP.
Thus, the density of the MP becomes lower, and its levitation coordination
thereby shifts according to the target concentration. Further, this
method allows the quantitative evaluation of the complexation between
the aptamer and target molecules from the levitation behavior of the
MP.

Result and Discussion
Sensing Principle
The levitation
coordinate of an MP, z, in the CAG field is given
by22−28 1   2   3  where λ is the ultrasound wavelength, Eac is the average ultrasound energy density, a is a device-dependent parameter, V is
the voltage applied to the transducer, g is the gravitational
acceleration, and ρ and γ are the density and compressibility
of the medium (water in the present case), respectively. The prime
represents the corresponding properties of the MP. Eq 1 suggests that z is a function of the particle density and compressibility. Thus,
any change in the acoustic properties of the MP can be evaluated from
the shift of z.

Figure 1 shows the relationship between V and z of PMMAs with different densities, that is,
1.188 and 1.265 g cm–3. Because Eac is proportional to V2,
as indicated by eq 3,
a decrease in V lowers the levitation coordinate
of the MP. When the acoustic radiation force becomes smaller than
the threshold value (Vth), the MP is no
longer levitated. The levitation coordinate difference between the
PMMAs with different densities increases with decreasing V and is, therefore, maximized at Vth.
The solid curves represent the results of curve-fitting based on eq 1 with a as the fitting parameter. The compressibility was assumed to be
the same for both PMMAs (γ′ = 1.54 × 10–10 Pa–1). Curve fitting yielded a = 0.0408 and 0.0388 for low- and high-density PMMAs, respectively.
Because the a values determined for different MPs
almost agreed with each other, the average value, a = 0.040, is applied to the results as discussed below.

Figure 1 Relationships
between the voltage applied to the transducer (V)
and the levitation coordinates of PMMAs with different
densities: (A) 1.188 and (B) 1.265 g cm–3. Solid
curves were calculated using eq 1 with the fitting parameter a = 0.0408 and
0.0388 for A and B, respectively. Vth represents
the threshold V values for the PMMAs, below which
the particles do not levitate.

As shown in our previous work, the levitation coordinate of an
MP is dominantly determined by its density rather than compressibility
when the density of the MP is modified by the binding of the AuNPs.24,25 The AuNP possesses two orders of magnitude smaller compressibility
than the polymer MP, and therefore, the contribution from the former
to the entire compressibility is negligible even though AuNPs cover
the entire surface of the MP.25 In this
study, AuNP-bound PMMAs were prepared through complementary hybridization
between the aptamer DNA and probe DNA anchored on the particles as
illustrated in Figure 2. When the AuNP-bound PMMAs are treated with the target molecule,
the aptamer DNA interacts with the target and the duplex between the
aptamer and probe DNAs is dissociated. The release of AuNPs from the
AuNP-bound PMMA lowers its density, and thereby, z increases according to the amount of target added to the system.
Magnetic levitation (MagLev) is also an efficient method for measuring
the density of a particle.29 MagLev has
higher density resolution (10–2–10–6 g cm–3) than the present acoustic levitation.
However, magnetic levitation requires a paramagnetic medium, such
as Mn2+ or Gd3+, and, therefore, has limited
applicability to biological reactions. In addition, MagLev is typically
applied to millimeter (mm)-sized materials. Because AuNP-binding induces
a larger density change on smaller particles, the use of microparticle
is advantageous for sensitive sensing of AuNP binding. From these
standpoints, acoustic levitation is suitable for the present purpose.

Figure 2 Schematic
representation of aptamer-based sensing in the CAG field.

In this study, all of the measurements were conducted at V = 7.5 V, that is, Eac = 2.25
J m–3. Although a lower value of V is advantageous for high sensitivity, this voltage was selected
to obtain stable levitation; at lower voltage, the levitation coordinate
was changed with time. Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information shows the calculated relationship between the
number of AuNPs bound on a PMMA (nAuNP/PMMA) and the difference in z between the bare and AuNP-bound
PMMAs (Δz) at V = 7.5 V. A
linear relationship was confirmed in the range of nAuNP/PMMA = 0–6000. As noted above, a decrease
in the density of the AuNP-bound PMMA is induced by the aptamer–target
complexation in this study. Therefore, the target concentration can
be determined from a decrease in Δz. The linear
relationship shown in Figure S1 confirms
the reasonability of the principle of the present approach.

Aptamer-Based
Sensing of Target Molecules
Adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular
metabolism.30−33 The shortage of ATP causes various diseases such as angiocardiopathy,
hypoglycemia, ischemia, and Parkinson’s disease. Dopamine (DA) is a vital neurotransmitter
that plays a significant role in the functioning of our memory, behavior,
sleep, and cognition.34−36 The low concentration of DA is related to Parkinson’s
disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.
Therefore, the efficient sensing of these compounds of physiological
importance is strongly required in biomedical monitoring. Further,
ampicillin (AMP) is widely used to treat infectious bacterial diseases
such as pneumonia, gonorrhea, bronchitis, and venereal diseases because
of its broad spectrum and low cost.37,38 However, there
are several side effects such as skin rashes, dizziness, and diarrhea.
Thus, the development of the effective sensing of AMP is also a crucial
task.

Aptamer-mediated AuNP-bound PMMAs were treated with various
concentrations of the target, that is, ATP, DA, or AMP. The interaction
between the aptamer and target induces the dissociation of the binding
between the PMMA and AuNP, and Δz decreases
as a result. Figure 3 shows the relationships between the logarithmic concentration of
ATP, DA, and AMP (log c) and Δz of the PMMA. The levitation of the PMMA was repeatedly measured
five times; the error bars in Figure 3 are given based on the standard deviations (σ).
The errors in the Δz measurements originate
from the deviations of the PMMA size, difference in the ratio of the
AuNP-binding between PMMAs, and the instability of the acoustic field.
The first factor becomes marginal as the size of the MP increases.
In contrast, the sensitivity is higher for smaller MPs because a larger
density change is induced by binding of AuNPs. Hence, the size of
MP should be optimized taking these two different size dependencies
into consideration; the present size (d ∼
10 μm) was thus determined.24 We
confirmed that the acoustic field instability comes not from a temperature
change but from a change in the acoustic resonance conditions in the
entire instrumental system. It was difficult to keep exactly the same
resonance conditions for different measurements; the deviations of
Δz mainly arise from this factor. Evidently,
Δz decreases with increasing log c in a sigmoidal manner. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined
from 3σ for Δz of the probe PMMA in the
absence of the target. The details for the determination of LOD are
given in Figure S2 and related descriptions
in Supporting Information. The LODs for ATP, DA, and AMP were 9.8
nM, 17 nM, and 160 pM, respectively. This means that 3.2 × 108 ATP, 5.5 × 108 DA, and 5.0 × 106 AMP molecules are detectable per single PMMA.

Figure 3 Relationships between
the logarithmic concentration target (log c) and
Δz for ATP (blue), DA (red),
and AMP (black). The red dashed line represents the average maximum
Δz at rPMMA/AuNP = 10,000.

Figure 4 shows FE-SEM
images of AuNP-bound PMMAs designed for ATP detection. The particles
are compared after reactions with 1 nM and 1 mM ATP. Almost no AuNPs
are seen on the PMMA after the reaction with 1 mM ATP, whereas a number
of AuNPs remain on the PMMA when treated with 1 nM ATP. Thus, the
FE-SEM observation revealed that AuNPs bound on the PMMA were effectively
released by the duplex dissociation caused by the reaction of the
aptamer with ATP. In this work, the number ratio of AuNPs to PMMA
in a sample solution (rAuNP/PMMA) was
maintained at 10,000. The surface coverage of AuNPs on the PMMA should
be 25% assuming the complete reaction between AuNPs and PMMA. However,
as shown in Figure 4, the number of AuNPs on the PMMA was smaller than that expected
from the complete binding. This arises from the incomplete binding
of AuNPs as well as the loss of AuNPs during the sample preparation
for FE-SEM such as filtering, washing, and sputtering. Therefore,
the use of FE-SEM for determining of the number of AuNPs bound on
a PMMA was not appropriate. We evaluated the actual number of AuNPs
bound on a PMMA (nAuNP/PMMA) from Δz. At rAuNP/PMMA = 10,000, the
measured Δz was 71 ± 5.2 μm. The
linear relationship between Δz and nAuNP/PMMA shown in Figure S1 is represented by the equation Δz = 1.48 × 10–2nAuNP/PMMA. From this relation, we confirmed that nAuNP/PMMA = 4736 ± 338 for Δz = 71 ± 5.2
μm. This indicates that the reaction ratio of AuNPs was 47%
under the present condition. The surface coverage of AuNPs on the
PMMA is thus 12% at rAuNP/PMMA = 10,000.
Thus, the present scheme shown in Figure 2 works well, as expected.

and (B) c = 1 mM.

Application to a Blood Sample
The present method was
applied to the determination of ATP in swine blood. The blood was
diluted 104 times with water. The known amounts of ATP
were spiked to the diluted blood. AuNP-bound PMMAs mediated by the
ATP-aptamer DNA molecules (rAuNP/PMMA =
10,000) were added to the diluted blood and spiked samples, and Δz values were measured for resulting PMMAs in the CAG field. Figure 5 compares the calibration
graphs obtained for the diluted blood and for aqueous ATP standard
solutions. The Δz values were converted into
the ratio of the aptamer molecules that reacted with ATP. This value
was plotted against the logarithmic concentration of ATP in this figure.
The plots for the standard solutions prepared in water almost overlapped
with that prepared in diluted swine blood, suggesting that the blood
matrices did not interfere with the present detection scheme.

Figure 5 Calibration
graphs for ATP in swine blood. Black open circles;
standard solutions prepared in water. Red solid circles; standard
solution prepared in diluted swine blood.

From the calibration graph, the ATP concentration in the diluted
swine blood was determined to be 17.6 nM; the original blood contained
176 μM ATP. The concentration of ATP was also determined by
a luciferase assay to validate this concentration; this method also
requires 104 times dilution of the blood sample. The luminescence
measurement gave 202 μM ATP in the original blood. The agreement
between these two values indicates that the present scheme is applicable
to real samples without pretreatments.

The incubation time of
4 h in the present method can be a disadvantage
for practical purposes. We did not attempt to reduce the incubation
time because applications are not the main purpose of the present
work. Our previous work24 indicates that
the long incubation time originates from the low diffusion nature
of the particles and that the reduction of the time results in incomplete
reactions (in the present case, the incomplete dissociation of AuNPs
from PMMA). However, because the reproducibility rather than incomplete
reactions is crucial in practical analyses, the incubation time can
be substantially reduced. This is a task for facilitating practical
applications.

Equilibrium Model in Aptamer Sensing
As shown in Figure 2, AuNPs, which are
bound on the PMMA through hybridization by the aptamer DNA, are released
by the interaction between the aptamer and its target molecule. Therefore,
the sensitivity of the present scheme is determined by the balance
between the sandwich hybridization strength and the stability of the
aptamer–target complex. Figure 6 summarizes the equilibria involved in the present
scheme. The present results were analyzed using this equilibrium model.
The amount of capture DNA anchored on the PMMAs (A) was fluorometrically
determined to be 1.6 × 107 molecules per particle
using FITC-labeled complementary DNAs. All the capture DNA molecules
can be involved in the interparticle hybridization. In contrast, only
one reporter DNA molecule on an AuNP takes part in the interparticle
hybridization in the presence of the aptamer, and the rest remain
free after the completion of the interparticle hybridization. Because
of the dominant population of AuNPs over PMMAs in a reaction solution,
AuNP-bridged PMMA aggregation was not observed. Therefore, the concentration
of C depicted in Figure 6 can be considered to be equal to that of AuNPs. Figure S3 shows the relationship between log K1 and the number of AuNPs bound on a PMMA at rAuNP/PMMA = 10,000. As shown above, because nAuNP/PMMA = 4736 ± 338, K1 was determined to be 1.58 × 1020 M–2.

Figure 6 Equilibrium models of aptamer-based sensing. (A)–(F) represent
(A) capture probe DNA anchored on PMMA, (B) aptamer, (C) AuNP with
probe DNA, (D) duplex between the aptamer and probe DNA molecules,
(E) target, and (F) aptamer–target complex.

Figure 7 shows
the
relationship between log c and the reaction ratios
for three aptamer-target combinations. The sigmoidal curves shown
in Figure 7 were calculated
assuming K2 = 1.00 × 10–11 M for AMP and 1.58 × 10–13 M for DA and K2 = 3.98 × 10–14 M for
ATP. Because the dissociation constant of the aptamer and the target, K3, is given by K3 = 1/(K1K2), its values are 6.33 × 10–10, 4.00 ×
10–8, and 1.59 × 10–7 M–1 for AMP, DA, and ATP, respectively. All of these
dissociation constants are larger than the corresponding reported
values.39−41 The affinity between the target and the aptamer DNA
as well as the strength of the DNA duplex formation is influenced
by the buffer salt concentration and/or composition.42−45 For example, Baldrich et al. reported that the structure of thrombin-binding
aptamer (TBA) depends on the types of salt added to the system.42 Although the TBA–thrombin complex was
stable in the presence of KCl, the addition of Na+ or Mg2+ disrupted the formation of the complex. On the other hand,
Munzar et al. reported that the hybridization affinity of the aptamer–complementary
DNA duplex increases with the increasing concentration of ions in
the buffer.44 Thus, the aptamer–target
complexation and formation of an aptamer duplex depend on various
factors involving types and concentrations of salts. Therefore, a
simple comparison of the dissociation constants for the aptamer–target
complexation is difficult. The results discussed here indicate that
the present method can be an efficient tool for the evaluation of
the aptamer–target complexation.

Figure 7 Relationships between
the logarithmic target concentration (log c) and
the reaction ratios of aptamers-targets calculated
from Δz shown in Figure 3. Symbols: ATP: blue dots, DA: red dots,
and AMP: black dots. Curves represent the results of calculation assuming K1 = 1.58 × 1020 M–2, K2 = 1.00 × 10–11 for AMP, 1.58 × 10–13 for DA, and 3.98 ×
10–14 M for ATP.

Basically, 1:1 aptamer–target binding was assumed for the
explanation of the experimental results shown in Figure 6. However, it was reported
that the ATP aptamer has two binding sites.45,46 A calculation was also attempted by considering 1:2 (aptamer: ATP)
complexation for ATP, as shown in Figure S4. Evidently, the calculated curve departs from the experimental plots
and cannot explain the experimental results better than the 1:1 binding
assumption. Thus, the 1:1 complexation between the ATP and aptamer
is reasonable in the present case.

Conclusions
We
proposed aptamer-based sensing for ATP, DA, and AMP as test
targets using the CAG field. In this scheme, the duplex of aptamer–complementary
DNA is dissociated through aptamer–target complexation, and
Δz in the CAG field decreases as a result.
The detection limit ranges from picomolar (pM) to nanomolar (nM) depending
on the affinity between the aptamer and the target. This scheme also
allows us to evaluate the dissociation constants of the aptamer–target
complexes without labeling. This is another advantage of the present
scheme.

Aptamer DNAs have been developed for inorganic ions
(K+, Hg2+, and so on), organic molecules (cocaine,
ibuprofen,
and so on), large biomolecules (peptides and proteins), and microorganisms
(bacteria and cells). The present sensing scheme was designed so that
the aptamer crosslinks the two probe DNA molecules anchored on the
PMMA and AuNP to yield the AuNP-bound PMMA. This scheme can be extended
to any similar system simply by changing the sequence of aptamer and
complimentary probe DNA molecules. Further, simultaneous detection
of multiple targets is possible using MPs of different sizes, as reported
in the case of microRNA detection in our previous work.23 Simultaneous detection is necessary to provide
reliable diagnoses under conditions such as inflammation, fungal infection,
and toxin accumulation. Thus, the application of the present scheme
to a wide range of fundamental and practical fields, including biochemistry,
environmental science, and medical diagnoses, is expected.

Experimental
Section
The instrument used in this study was basically the
same as that
employed in our previous work.22−28Figure S5 shows a photo of the instrumental
setup. The levitation of an MP was measured in a silica glass cell
(of 30 mm length, 8 mm width, and 12.62 mm height) with a rectangular
channel (of 3.0 mm width and 1.5 mm height) pasted on a transducer
(2 cm × 2 cm lead zirconate titanate, resonance frequency of
500 kHz, Fuji Ceramics). The resonance frequency was 453 kHz under
experimental conditions. A diluted MP suspension was introduced into
the cell, and a single MP was entrapped by the acoustic radiation
force. The levitation coordinate of the particle was measured at a
constant voltage of V = 7.5 V supplied to the transducer.

Two types of polymethyl methacrylate MPs (PMMAs) were used to study
the effect of their density on the levitation coordinate. PMMA with
a density of 1.265 g cm–3 was purchased from GreenChem
Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Carboxyl-functionalized PMMA (C-PMMA; 9.57 ±
0.21 μm diameter, 1.188 g cm–3 density) was
purchased from Microparticle GmbH (Berlin, Germany). The carboxyl
group density of the C-PMMA was 20 μmol g–1. The particle concentration of the C-PMMA in the stock solution
was determined to be 1.88 × 108 mL–1 by counting the number of particles contained in 2 μL aliquots
of the suspension using a microscope. The carboxyl-functionalized
AuNPs with a 100 nm diameter were purchased from Cytodiagnostics (Burlington,
Canada). The carboxyl group density of the AuNPs was 255 μmol
g–1. The concentration of AuNPs was determined to
be 1.92 × 1011 mL–1 by UV–vis
spectrometry, which was developed by Fernig et al.47 The probe and aptamer DNA were purchased from Fasmac Co.,
Ltd. (Kanagawa, Japan). ATP, DA, and AMP were selected as the aptamer-target
molecules. The aptamer DNA sequences were determined by referring
to the literature.39−41Table 1 summarizes the sequences of nucleotides (probe and aptamer DNA molecules)
used in this work. The amino-terminated DNA probes were covalently
conjugated onto the C-PMMAs and carboxyl-functionalized AuNPs by the
condensation reaction using 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethyl carbodiimide
and N-hydroxysuccinimide. Swine blood containing
sodium citrate as the anticoagulant was purchased from KAC Co. (Kyoto,
Japan). The blood was diluted 104 times with water and
then used for the determination of the ATP concentration.

Aptamer DNA was added to a 10 μL aliquot
of a capture DNA-anchored
PMMA suspension. The mixture was diluted to 300 μL with tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.4, containing 140 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2)
and shaken for 4 h. The reporter DNA-anchored AuNPs (170 μL)
were then added to the mixture. The mixture was diluted to 1 mL with
tris–HCl buffer and left to stand for 4 h. The mixture was
sonicated every 15 min. The number ratio of PMMAs to AuNPs (rAuNP/PMMA) was maintained constant at 10,000
for all of the experiments. The AuNP-bound PMMA suspension was added
to the aptamer–target solution. Thereafter, the mixture was
diluted to 1.5 mL with tris–HCl buffer and left to stand for
4 h. The mixture was sonicated every 15 min. The number ratio of the
aptamer DNA to the AuNP-bound PMMA was maintained constant at 11,000
for all the experiments. Thus, the number ratio of PMMA/AuNP/aptamer
was 1:10,000:11,000.

For comparison purpose, the concentration
of ATP in the blood sample
was determined by a luciferase assay using an ATP determination kit
(BA100) purchased from Toyo B-Net (Tokyo, Japan). Luminescence was
measured using a luminometer, Luminescencer Octa (ATTO, Tokyo).

JSM-7500F (JEOL, Japan) was used to observe the field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of PMMAs. The FE-SEM
was operated at 6 kV. High-resolution images were obtained using secondary
electron detection. The samples were coated with Pt/Pd.
