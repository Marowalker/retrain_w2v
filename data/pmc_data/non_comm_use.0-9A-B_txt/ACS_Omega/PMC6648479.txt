A facile
formulation of fast-drying fluorescent ink made from nanostructured
fluorescent silica nanocrystals is presented. The rheostable viscous
ink suitable for screen printing was developed by careful selection
of organic vehicle components, which was later printed onto various
rigid and flexible substrates. Photoluminescence studies of the printed
film confirmed that the formulated ink composition did not show noticeable
influence on the excitation property of the fluorescent silica. The
developed cost-effective and fast-curing fluorescent silica ink with
desirable luminescent property makes it a suitable candidate for information
encryption, optical devices, and energy conversion applications.

Introduction
In recent years, fluorescent nanoparticles
have attracted much
attention in emergent fields such as nanobiotechnology, photonics,
and optoelectronics.1,2 Commonly used fluorescent materials
are organically modified silica, hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic
polymers, semiconducting organic polymers, quantum dots, carbonaceous
nanomaterials such as carbon dots, carbon nanoclusters, and nanotubes,
metal particles, and metal oxides.3,4 However, when
considering limitations such as low detection efficiency, complicated
processing, and toxicity, hybrid structures formed of an organic dye
molecule-incorporated inorganic matrix are highly recommended.5 This core–shell architecture has an added
benefit of designing new geometries by incorporating multiple functionalities
into a single nanoparticle.6,7 Of various inorganic
matrixes, the silica matrix has been widely studied because of its
biocompatibility nature. Moreover, silica can act as a mechanically
and chemically stable vehicle, thereby protecting the encapsulated
dye from external perturbations.8,9 Fluorescent silica nanoparticles
have pertinent applications in the field of information technology,
biotechnology, and medicine owing to their tunable size, optical transparency,
high hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity.10 Recently, fluorescent inks have also been used
as security markers with the objective of preventing theft and forgery.11,12

Recent advances have been focussed on organic fluorophore-encapsulated
hybrid structures because of their increased brightness and photostable
matrix compared to the single organic dye. Incorporation of dyes into
the silica matrix can be easily achieved with either covalent bonding13 or noncovalent bonding14 of the dye with the silica matrix. Considering several advantages,
the noncovalent approach is the most preferable way to encapsulate
the fluorophores inside the sol–gel-derived colloidal silica
matrix.15 The well-known Stöber
method was traditionally chosen for sol–gel synthesis of monodisperse
nanomicrometer-sized silica particles. In such a typical process,
the molecular precursor of silica is initially reacted with water
in an alcoholic solution and then the resultant molecules are assembled
together to build larger complex structures.16

Several modifications were carried out to achieve size-controlled
synthesis of silica nanoparticles.17,18 In 2005, Ow
et al. successfully synthesized nanometer-sized fluorescent silica
nanoparticles through a modified Stöber route, in which a core–shell
architecture consisting of a fluorophore-rich center was capped within
a siliceous shell.19 With the aid of a
similar core–shell architecture, silica nanoparticles incorporated
with fluorescent dyes were also developed subsequently by Burns et
al. for chemical sensor applications.20 In an interesting work published in 2013, Yoo and Pak synthesized
size-controlled fluorescent silica nanoparticles through a reverse
(water in oil) microemulsion method.21 Because
the dye-doped silica nanoparticles are susceptible to leakage and
irreversible photodestruction when dispersed in organic solvents,
controlling their dye leakage is highly crucial in security applications.
In the present study, a double-layer approach was developed to reduce
the dye leakage, wherein the fluorophore molecules are encapsulated
in the silica matrix. Here, the second outermost silica layer, created
by the condensation of alkoxy silane, will successfully incorporate
the organic fluorophores into the silica double layer through electrostatic
attraction.

For practical printed tag applications, screen printing
is a widely
adopted strategy. Development of a colloidal fluorescent ink is a
challenge because the ink’s vehicle contains dispersants, solvents,
and binders, whose presence can eventually lead to photodegradation.
In general, fluorescent inks provide a platform for a wide range of
applications in domains such as information storage, bioimaging, smart
packaging, and nanoelectronics.22 For the
past few years, carbon dots and functionalized carbon dots, and coumarin
derivative fluorescent ink were extensively studied.23 In 2012, low toxic and biocompatible carbon dot-based fluorescent
ink was formulated and its distinct fluorescent properties were studied.24 Gao et al. reported green route synthesis of
nitrogen-doped carbon dots, and their performance as fluorescent ink
and electrocatalysts were demonstrated.25 Metal-free water-soluble graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots as
invisible security ink was developed by Song et al. for data security
applications.24 Recently, nitrogen-doped
graphene dots and magnesium–nitrogen-embedded carbon dots were
reported for anticounterfeiting and copper metal sensing applications,
respectively.26,27 For anticounterfeiting applications,
inkjet printing of colloidal photonic crystals was extensively studied.28−30

So far, no serious attempts were made toward formulating leak-free
core–shell based fluorescent silica - ink having stable
luminescence  and low toxicity. Herein, we report the formulation
of a stable screen-printable fluorescent ink by choosing fluorescent
double-layered silica nanoparticles as the filler, Butvar as the binder,
and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the dispersant. The presently
adopted core–shell architecture-based ink is advantageous because
it prevents cluster formation. Owing to its stable fluorescence and
good solubility in ethanol medium, our quick-dry fluorescent ink can
find applications in the field of printable fluorescent tags.

Materials
and Methods
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99%), 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTS, 98%), fluorescein (free acid, C12H20O5), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 28–30 wt %
ammonia), cyclohexane (C6H12, 99%), 1-hexanol
(C6H5OH, 98%), poly vinyl butyral (PVB) (registered
trademark of Solutia, Inc. as Butvar), and SDS were purchased from
Aldrich Chemicals Co. Brij35 [a polymer of ethylene glycol and dodecyl
ether ((C2H4O)23C12H25OH)] was received from Merck Chemicals. All the raw materials
and solvents were used as received without any further purification.

Synthesis
of Fluorescent Double-Layered Silica Nanoparticles
Fluorescent
double-layered silica nanoparticles were synthesized
in a reverse microemulsion method.21 A
reverse microemulsion (water in oil, W/O) is an isotropic and thermodynamically
stable single-phase system that consists of water, oil, and surfactant,
which is highly stable than normal emulsion method. The water droplets
were first stabilized by surfactant molecules and then get dispersed
in the bulk oil phase, which serves as reactors for the synthesis
of nanoparticles. In brief, Brij35 (5.4 g, 1.6 mmol) was added with
38.5 mL of cyclohexane and 8 mL of 1-hexanol, and the solution was
kept under sonication until a transparent clear solution was obtained.
Deionized water (1.7 mL) was added and sonicated further for 15 min.
To the clear solution, 0.5 mmol of TEOS was added and stirred for
30 min. Prior to hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS, aqueous fluorescein
(0.4 mL of 1 × 10–2 M, 1.6 μmol) was
mixed to the reverse microemulsion. In the microemulsion, TEOS was
initially hydrolyzed by adding ammonia and later condensed in the
presence of fluorescein to generate fluorescein-doped silica nanoparticles.
Without breaking the microemulsion system, APTS (0.5 mmol) was then
added into the above reaction mixture before removing excess fluorescein,
where APTS has been hydrolyzed and condensed on the surface of the
fluorescein-doped silica nanoparticles. This sequential process helped
the formation of the second layer of silica and finally yielded the
core–shell structured double-layered silica nanoparticles.
The synthesized double-layered silica nanoparticles have good solubility
in aqueous medium and were separated from ethanol by centrifugation.
The microemulsion was then destabilized by adding acetone, centrifuged,
and washed with ethanol four to five times to obtain fluorescent double-layered
silica nanoparticles.

Formulation and Screen Printing of Fluorescent
Silica Ink
A stable dispersed fluorescent ink can be developed
by judiciously
blending the double-layered silica nanoparticles with a suitable surfactant,
binder, and carrier solvent.31 In the present
work, 60 wt % fluorescent silica, PVB (Butvar), and SDS and ethanol
were chosen as the filler, binder, and surfactant, respectively. Here,
the ink formulation was begun with mixing of 2 wt % dispersant (w.r.t
filler) with ethanol in order to enhance the dispersion process. The
process was carried out for 10 min on a magnetic stirrer. Later on,
fluorescent silica nanoparticles were added and stirred continuously
for another 6 h, followed by the addition of the binder. The whole
solution was stirred again for 24 h to derive a homogeneous viscous
ink. The ink was screen-printed with the desired pattern with the
aid of a screen mesh having 350 counts. The customized screen mesh
in the present study was created by coating the screen in photoemulsion
and curing the areas which are required, and the surplus emulsion
was washed off to obtain the desired pattern.32

Characterization
The nanoparticles and the core–shell
structure were analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) (FEI Tecnai G2 30S-TWIN, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). The
rheological characteristics of the ink were measured using a Rheo
plus32 rheometer (Anton Paar, Ashland, VA, USA) operating in both
rotational and oscillation modes. Screen printing was done through
semiautomatic screen printer (EKRA, Germany) which operated at a printing
speed of ∼30 cm/s. The ink was screen-printed on various substrates,
and the surface morphology was analyzed by using a scanning electron
microscope (Zeiss EVO 18 Cryo SEM, Jena, Germany). The surface roughness
of the printed film was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
(MultiMode, Bruker, Germany). UV–vis spectra of the solution
state were recorded with a UV spectrophotometer (UV-1800 Shimadzu)
in the range of 200–900 nm. The absorption properties of the
printed pattern were characterized using a UV–vis near-infrared
source (Ocean Optics). Excitation and emission spectra of the solution
and film states were recorded with a Spex-Fluorolog FL22 spectrofluorimeter
equipped with a double grating 0.22 m Spex 1680 monochromator and
a 450 W Xe lamp as the excitation source.

Results and Discussion
Microstructural
Analysis of Fluorescent Double-Layered Silica
Nanoparticles
As described earlier, the fluorescent double-layered
silica nanoparticles were developed by the coupling of fluorescein
species as a core in core–shell architecture. One of the principal
merits of this procedure is that the size of the silica nanoparticles
can be effectively tailored by changing the water-to-surfactant ratio.
These cores can act as nuclei for the growth of the silica shell,
thereby protecting the encapsulated dyes.19 For a screen-printable stable dispersed ink, uniform particle size
distribution is more preferred because of microstructural homogeneity
considerations. Prior to the ink formulation, particle size and morphology
analyses were carried out by TEM. Sample preparation was done by suspending
double-layered silica nanoparticles in ethanol medium, and the particle
size and morphology were studied. TEM analysis of the abovementioned
monodispersed solution was carried out by drop-casting it onto a copper
grid, and the microscopic images are depicted in Figure 1. TEM images clearly show the
spherical morphology of the fluorescent nanoparticles, and the average
particle size of double-layered silica nanoparticles comes around
70–80 nm, which is in the desirable range to maintain the colloidal
stability of the ink suspension.33 Thin
mesoporous shells are uniformly coated over the silica core surface
at a thickness of ∼15 nm. The peculiar architecture effectively
protects the fluorescein dye molecules within the matrix and was developed
in a uniform and orderly fashion.

silica nanoparticles
in ethanol medium, under different magnifications.

The security features inscribed using invisible
fluorescent inks
have widespread applications in passports, bank notes, and credit
cards. Maintaining the fluorescence intensity in the printed ink is
a challenge because the ink contains other organic components such
as solvents, dispersants, binders, and homogenizers. The formation
of double-layered silica nanoparticles with encapsulated dye molecules
and their journey into a flatbed printed structure are schematically
shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Schematic
description of the synthesis of screen-printable fluorescent
double-layered silica ink.

Ink printability is a function of both physical and chemical
properties
of the filler, additives, and solvents employed in the ink formulation.
In the typical formulation of ink, the role of SDS is to effectively
disperse the filler nanoparticles in the solvent and thereby improve
the colloidal stability of the ink. It will also help to decrease
the coagulation of the ink. Ethanol acts as a vehicle for the uniform
distribution of the filler and also controls the drying rate of the
formulated ink. Because of the high volatile nature of ethanol, it
facilitates the drying rate compared to aqueous-based screen-printable
inks.34,35 As is obvious, the purpose of the binder
is to uniformly distribute the filler nanoparticles in the polymer
matrix and to increase the adhesion of the fluorescent ink onto the
substrate to which it is printed. Ideal proportional mixing of the
filler, binder, and dispersants enables uniform printing and better
adhesion of the printed pattern. In a stable ink suspension, the particle
size and hence the mass of the dispersed filler phase should be as
low as possible so that its kinetic energy is too small to overcome
the electrostatic repulsion between charged layers of the dispersing
vehicle phase. Hence, along with particle size, viscosity is a critical
property of any ink for high-precision smooth printing. The rheological
analysis of the formulated ink is given in Figure 3. For effective screen printing, the viscosity
should be in the range of 1–10 Pa s.36,37 From viscosity and shear stress plots, shown in Figure 3a, it is clear that with increased
shear rate, the viscosity of the ink gets decreased. With the addition
of SDS, colloidal stability of the formulated ink was maintained and
the formulated ink showed a viscosity of 12 Pa s at a lower shear
rate of 10 s–1 which further got decreased to about
9 Pa s at a higher shear rate. By increasing the shear rate, viscosity
becomes substantially thinner and hence causes the ink to flow readily
because of its pseudo-plastic behavior, which is clearly visible in
the depicted plot. Another dynamic property of the ink is its viscoelastic
nature, defined by the elastic/solid-like (storage modulus, G′) and viscous/liquid-like (loss modulus, G″) (see Figure 3b) behaviors. From the figure, it is clear that the
value of G″ is higher than G′ in the given range of strain. This further confirmed the
liquid-like behavior of the formulated ink, which is necessary to
perform high aspect ratio screen printing.38,39 Hence, the viscosity and dynamic viscoelastic properties of the
ink are proved to be feasible for screen printing.

Figure 3 (a) Variation of viscosity
with the shear rate. The inset given
is the photographic image of the developed highly viscous ink and
(b) dynamic viscoelastic properties of the developed double-layered
fluorescent silica ink.

The photographic image of the viscous ink and printed patterns
is shown in Figure 4. Fine screen printing can be achieved through a leveling process,
and it depends upon certain factors such as rheology, surface tension,
and flow time characteristics of the ink and also the mesh size and
quality of both squeegee and screen.40 During
the screen printing process, the ink was forced to flow through the
screen mesh openings, thereby producing high shear rates. As it passes
through, the ink obtained its lowest viscosity, and once the screen
is removed, the mechanical shear forces cease, and at the same moment,
the ink is deposited onto the substrate. Thus, several patterns corresponding
to the screen mesh could be printed on various flexible and rigid
substrates. Figure 4a shows the NIIST-CSIR emblem screen-printed on a flexible Mylar
film under visible light. It is worth noting that the printed pattern
shows stable green emission under UV light (365 nm), as seen in Figure 4b. Figure 4c shows the bright fluorescence
of the formulated ink under handheld UV light.

ink printed on a flexible Mylar
substrate, (b) under a handheld UV lamp, showing bright green emission,
and (c) fluorescent ink under UV light.

Quality of printed films was examined through scanning electron
micrographs, as depicted in Figure 5. The current ink formulation facilitates fast and
natural drying of printed patterns typically less than 20 s because
of the high volatile nature of the solvent chosen, ethanol, compared
to aqueous-based screen-printable inks. The printed ink was found
to be cured within seconds soon after the screen printing process,
and this helps to produce a homogenized film without much porosity.
This is clearly visible from scanning microscopy images. Figure 5a shows the low-resolution
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of printed film, where the
agglomerates of modified nanoparticles formed micron-sized spherical
particles. From the high-magnification images of Figure 5b,c, it is evident that the
filler particles were uniformly distributed, thus making the printing
more or less uniform. However, along with uniform distribution, a
fractional amount of porosity could be found in the microstructure,
which might be as a result of high evaporation of organic solvents
used in the ink preparation. Figure 5d shows the cross-sectional microstructure of the fluorescent
ink printed on the Mylar film. The cross-sectional image clearly presents
a clear morphological distinction between the printed film and the
substrate, with a thickness of the printed layer around 15 μm.
The thickness was found to be uniform throughout the layer, which
further implies the homogeneity of the printed pattern.

Figure 5 (a) High-resolution
surface image of the printed layer, (b,c) low-magnification
surface images, and (d) cross-sectional image of the printed film
showing thickness of the printed layer.

Figure 6 illustrates
the surface topographies of the screen-printed film. A clear microstructure
of the printed fluorescent silica layer is clearly visible from the
3D AFM images. A typical 3D image of the printed film shows minor
bumps and valleys, which can be minimized by using a hard flood, while
holding the screen off the platen and also using a soft stroke during
printing.34,36 The unevenness of the printed film was measured
from kurtosis topography, and a value of around 2.30 was obtained.
If the surface has relatively high mountains and low valleys, the
kurtosis value is less than 3, which is typically referred as platykurtoic.41 A kurtosis value greater than 3 signifies the
surface contains high peaks and low valleys, and the distribution
curve is called as leptokurtoic. As seen, the present screen-printed
fluorescent silica layer surface is platykurtoic. From AFM images,
the average surface roughness (Ra) and
the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of
the film were estimated and were found to be 87.3 and 107 nm, respectively.
These values were in good agreement with the earlier reports on screen-printable
inks.34,36 Profile symmetry information was obtained
from the skewness value of the film. Because bumps and valleys are
predominant in the developed film, the expected skewness moment is
negative. The present film gained a skewness of around −0.237,
confirming the bumps and valleys nature of the film.34 The obtained surface roughness and skewness are good enough
for screen-printing applications.

film in the
tapping mode.

Fluorescent studies of
the as-synthesized double-layered silica
nanoparticles and the printed surface with a suitable excitation wavelength
spectrum were carried out. Both nanoparticles and the printed surface
emit bright fluorescence with discrete peak emission. Absorption and
emission properties of the synthesized fluorescent silica nanoparticles
and the developed film are presented in Figure 7a,b, respectively. The absorption spectra
of double-layered nanoparticles show bright and strong emission, confirming
the successful doping of the dye within the silica matrix. The maximum
emission wavelength of double-layered silica nanoparticles obtained
is at 519 nm, which is more or less in concordance with earlier reports.21 However, the emission intensity of the fluorescent
printed pattern obtained was lower compared to that of the corresponding
fluorescent silica nanoparticles. A similar trend was observed for
excitation spectra of the printed film and fluorescent silica nanoparticles.
Emission spectra of both powder and film were obtained upon excitation
at a wavelength of 470 nm. As shown, the strongest fluorescence emission
is observed for fluorescent double-layered nanoparticles at a wavelength
of 530 nm upon excitation. The same excitation wavelength was used
to excite the fluorescent silica-printed film on the Mylar substrate,
where the emission was obtained at a wavelength of 525 nm. The emission
wavelength and corresponding intensity of the printed film were slightly
altered. The intensity discrepancy in both absorption and excitation
spectra is mainly due to the additional components such as the binder
and dispersant added for the formulation of rheostable ink. These
additives are indispensable but may reduce the intensity counts of
the film, showing less absorption and emission intensity compared
to core–shell-structured fluorescent silica nanoparticles.42 However, it is clear that the intensity of emission
spectra of the printed film was not significantly affected by the
ink components, which further confirms the fluorescence stability
of the developed film to be similar to core–shell architecture.
For practical applications, photostability of the printed film should
be investigated through continuous irradiation. The normalized fluorescence
data plotted against irradiation duration carried on for 180 min are
shown in the inset of Figure 7b. Emission intensity was found to be decreased by 26% of
its initial value at 60 min. After 180 min of continuous irradiation,
the apparent drop was only 28%, as shown in the figure. These studies
unveil the excellent photostability of the printed film over time,
which is ideally suited for practical applications.

Conclusions
UV-readable fluorescent inks have potential
applications in optical
reading systems, intelligence information, and automatic identification
systems. However, sustaining the fluorescence at the printed level
requires a lot of optimization in synthetic chemistry and ink formulation.
With the aim of developing a fast-curing fluorescent ink, we synthesized
fluorescent silica nanoparticles through a modified Stöber
method. Morphology and particle size of synthesized particles were
analyzed through TEM micrographs. The rheostable viscous ink of fluorescent
silica was formulated by choosing ethanol as the solvent system, whereas
SDS and Butvar were used as the dispersant and the binder, respectively.
The microstructure, surface roughness, and emission properties of
the developed ink were measured. Even though the printed film got
less intensity than corresponding fluorescent nanoparticles, the peak
position of the film was not much affected. Hence, the developed ink
provides promising applications in the fields of automatic identification,
optical devices, and information encryption.
