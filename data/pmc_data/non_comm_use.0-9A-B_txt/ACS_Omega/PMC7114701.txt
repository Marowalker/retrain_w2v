As-
and Cl-containing impurities are highly detrimental to sulfided
catalysts in hydrotreating processes. To prevent the irreversible
loss of activity of the main sulfide catalysts by As and Cl contaminants,
a protective double-layered guard bed catalyst is applied. Two types
of mesoporous silica supports (SBA-15 and MCF) were used to obtain
sorption-catalytic materials. The high specific surface area of the
supports allowed for a significant increase in access to the active
catalyst centers. The NiMo/SBA-15/Al2O3 and
NiMg/MCF/Al2O3 sorption-catalytic materials
demonstrated high activity and stability over 48 h for the simultaneous
removal of As and Cl. The catalytic materials allowed for reducing
the concentrations of As and Cl to less than 0.1 ppm in the diesel
fraction under the following conditions: 5.0 MPa pressure, 2.0 h–1 LHSV, 300 L/L H2-to-substrate volume ratio,
and 360 °C.

1 Introduction
Global
industry is gradually moving to the refining of heavy oil,
which contains numerous impurities and undesirable components, such
as metals, asphaltenes, resinous substances, sulfuric species, arsenic
substances, and others.1−4 Traditionally, the reduction of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing
substances in oil cuts has been realized by hydrotreating processes.5,6 Hydrotreating represents one of the most important catalytic processes,
and the annual sales of hydrotreating catalysts represent close to
10% of the total world market for catalysts.7 Hydrotreating implies a variety of hydrogenation processes, which
saturate aromatics and remove impurities from different oil cuts.8−16 Some of the oils of Russia and Venezuela contain up to 5 ppm As,
described by the general formula RR′R″As.17−22 Chlorine contaminants are presented in inorganic and organic forms
that destructively affect the processes of oil refining due to catalyst
deactivation and pipeline corrosion.23−26 Generally, the inorganic contaminants
are removed in the desalter, but organochlorine compounds (as well
as arsenic compounds) remain in the crude oil. In some cases, the
oil can be contaminated artificially with the compounds used in the
refining to accelerate the extraction from oilfields by cleaning oil
wells.27 Such compounds have to be removed
before the contaminants destroy the refining equipment. The hydrotreating
catalysts can be poisoned by arsenic and chlorine compounds and almost
cannot be reactivated during the periodic regenerations.4,10,11,20 Hydrotreating processes of oil cuts usually require the application
of a guard bed catalyst to protect the main catalyst bed from the
destructive formation of solid deposits in the upper part of a reactor.28,29 The guard bed allows for contaminant removal, a uniform distribution
of oil cuts over the reactor, and favorable hydrodynamic conditions
for the process.

To avoid the irreversible poisoning of hydrotreating
catalysts
by different contaminants and to improve the hydrodynamic conditions,
guard bed catalysts should be applied.30,31 The potential
supports that can provide a high adsorption capacity, effective filtration,
and decent mechanical strength as pellets are mesoporous materials.
Mesoporous materials (unlike zeolites) are preferred because of their
highly ordered pores and high surface area, which does not restrict
the diffusion and adsorption of large molecules.16,32−38 These characteristics are highly advantageous for a wide range of
applications, particularly in hydrotreating catalysis, because the
material pore size exceeds the size of the molecules of middle distillates,
and in particular, arsenic compounds.39−42 Moreover, the controlled medium
acidity of these materials would not cause cracking reactions. The
typical route of mesoporous materials and the catalysts situated on
them is shown in Scheme 1. After the micelle formation, inorganic hydroxides are precipitated,
followed by the template removal and wetness impregnation method.
During the hydrotreating process, Ni and Mo oxides are converted into
sulfides.

Scheme 1 Typical Catalyst Synthesis Route
In the course of previous study, three different mesoporous
aluminosilicates
were applied as the supports of guard bed catalysts: SBA-15, TUD,
and MCF.43,44 The catalytic tests demonstrated that the
Ni–Mo sorption-catalytic materials based on SBA-15, TUD, and
MCF exhibited a high activity toward arsenic removal in the model
diesel fraction. It was shown that the materials based on the acidic
supports (with aluminum content) did not fundamentally change the
catalytic properties of the samples. The high acidity led to coking
and the premature loss of activity of the materials. The optimal temperature
range for the arsenic removal was demonstrated as 360–380 °C
(mild conditions). The Ni–Mg SCMs based on the MCF mesoporous
materials allowed for the high removal of chlorine from middle distillates
under similar conditions.

In the current study, we describe
the application of new nickel-molybdenum
catalysts based on SBA-15 mesoporous materials and investigated their
activity for arsenic removal under various reaction conditions, using
straight-run diesel as a model fraction and triphenylarsine as a model
As contaminant. The combined hydrocatalytic removal of arsenic and
chlorine contaminants was performed using a fixed-bed reactor with
double-layered catalysts under the following conditions—360
°C, 5 MPa H2, LHSV = 2 h–1, and V(H2)/V(substrate) = 300:1.
The chlorine contaminant was ortho-dichlorobenzene,
serving as a model compound in the diesel fraction.

FTIR, 29Si (MAS) NMR, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm, X-ray
diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses
were used to characterize the samples.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Chemicals
The following precursors
were used for the preparation of micromesoporous aluminosilicates:
the triblock copolymer Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20, a molar weight of 5800, Aldrich), tetraethoxysilane
(EtO)4Si (Merck), ammonium metatungstate (NH4)6H2W12O40·H2O (>85% WO3, Aldrich), nickel nitrate Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (>98%, Aldrich), boehmite
(Pural SB, Sasol), and distilled water.

2.2 Sorption-Catalytic
Material Synthesis and
Catalytic Tests
The mesoporous materials of the types SBA-15
and MCF were obtained according to the following methods.45,46 The granulated supports (extrudates) were initially prepared using
boehmite as a binder and a dilute solution of HNO3 by an
extruder (d = 0.8 mm). The extrudates were dried
at 95 °C for 3 h, 150 °C for 3 h, and then calcined at 550
°C for 3 h. The resulting supports contained 35 wt % mesoporous
silica and 65 wt % γ-Al2O3 (after calcination).

The SBA-15/Al2O3 support was impregnated
with Ni and Mo salts via a double-stage method to obtain As-SCM (14.0
wt % MoO3 and 8.0 wt % NiO). The sources of the transition
metals included ammonium heptamolybdate [(NH4)6Mo7O24]·4H2O and nickel nitrate
hexahydrate Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. For
the preparation of nickel-promoted SCMs, SBA-15 was first impregnated
with MoO3 using an ammonium heptamolybdate solution in
0.5 M citric acid, dried overnight at 95 °C, and calcined at
550 °C for 6 h. This step was then followed by the introduction
of NiO using a nickel nitrate solution in 0.5 M citric acid, followed
by drying and calcination at 550 °C for 6 h.

The MCF support
was impregnated with Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O
in two stages via wetness impregnation to obtain Cl-SCM.
The synthesis route was the same as that for As-SCM except for the
impregnation part—in this case, the salts were dissolved in
distilled water without citric acid. The reagents for the impregnation
were calculated to obtain magnesium and nickel oxides in calcined
catalysts in the amounts of 10 and 5 wt %, respectively.

The
arsenic removal was studied using the straight-run diesel fraction
with the following properties: density at 20 °C—854 g/cm3, fractional composition: 50%—306 °C and 80%—320
°C, sulfur content—3650 ppm, and As content—5 ppm
(by addition Ph3As). The catalytic experiments were performed
in a flow laboratory setup under a hydrogen atmosphere (Figure S1). The catalytic experiments were performed
with the following parameters: catalyst volume—10 cm3; temperature 340–380 °C; LHSV of the diesel fraction,
1.0–4.0 h–1; hydrogen pressure, 4.0–6.0
MPa; and V(H2)/V(diesel
fraction) = 300:1.

The composition of SCMs and products were
analyzed by atomic emission
spectroscopy with inductively coupled plasma (AES–ICP) on a
Thermo Scientific ICAP 6300 DUO instrument.

2.3 Characterization
The textural characteristics
of the samples were determined by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption
(77 K) using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Prior to the analysis,
the samples were evacuated at 350 °C for 6 h. The specific surface
area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method at a relative partial pressure of P/P0 = 0.2. The pore size distribution was calculated
according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model
using the adsorption data.

The crushing strength of the catalysts
was determined in accordance with ASTM D6175 on a HOUNSFIELD H5KS
tensiometer (Tinius Olsen).

29Si NMR spectra were
recorded using a Bruker AVANCE-II
400 spectrometer at a magnetic field of 9.4 T, which corresponds to
an operating frequency of ν 29Si = 79.5 MHz. The
spectra of air-dried samples were recorded with a π/2 pulse
length of 6 μs, a cycle delay of 30 s, and a spinning rate of
5 kHz. The chemical shifts were referenced to TMS (Si(CH3)4).

For TEM, an LEO912 AB OMEGA microscope with
an electron tube voltage
of 100 kV was used. Typically, at least 300 particles were measured
to calculate the average slab length, , and stacking layer number, , where Li is the length of slab i, Ni is the number of
layers in slab i, Xi is the
number of slabs with length Li, and Yi is the
number of slabs with Ni layers.

The X-ray powder diffraction analysis was carried
out using a Rigaku
D/Max 2500 diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation) in the range of
5–100° 2θ, with a goniometer rotation speed of 2°
2θ min–1.

The XPS analysis was performed
on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD. To excite
the photoelectrons, aluminum anode X-ray radiation was used (Al Kα
= 1486.6 eV) with a tube voltage of 12 kV and an emission current
of 20 mA.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Material Characterization
According
to the results obtained by the low-temperature adsorption–desorption
of nitrogen, the silica materials acquired in the study exhibit a
large SBET (up to 850 m2/g)
and pore volume (0.6 cm3/g for SBA-15 and 1.6 cm3/g for MCF) (Table 1). All SCMs exhibit nitrogen isotherms with the same shape as those
of the support, but a drastic reduction in the specific surface area
and pore volume was observed. This decrease can be attributed to not
only the presence of Ni and Mo particles partially blocking the porous
network but also the increase in the density of the materials after
the incorporation of Ni, Mo, and Al2O3. The
same holds for the mechanical strength study: the incorporation of
Ni and Mo reduces the support strength by half. When the Ni–Mg
metal component was used in the catalyst, the strength was significantly
improved because of the MgO binding ability.

The nitrogen
sorption isotherms of calcined materials are shown
in Figure 1. The isotherms
for both SBA-15 and MCF materials belonged to type IV isotherms. According
to the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption–desorption technique,
the resulting SBA-15 mesoporous silica had a specific surface area
of 810 m2/g and an average pore size of 5.5 nm. The average
pore size of MCF was about 14 nm. The small-angle XRD reflections
for the samples SBA-15 and MCF showed that both materials had an ordered
mesoporous structure. The reflection for the SBA-15 sample was at
0.8°, which corresponds to an interplanar distance of 5.8 nm,
whereas for the MCF sample, the reflection was 0.35°, which corresponds
to 13.3 nm. Thus, two methods were in agreement in the structure determination.

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
and small-angle XRD patterns of SBA-15 and MCF materials.

The TEM micrographs clearly demonstrate the presence of mesopores
in the SBA-15 and MCF materials. The average pore sizes found with
the low-temperature adsorption–desorption of nitrogen are in
good agreement with the TEM data (Figure 2).

Figure 2 TEM images of SBA-15 (A), NiMo/SBA-15/Al2O3 (B), and MCF (C,D).

The 27Si NMR spectra for samples MCF and SBA-15 are
shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). The spectra are quite similar because of the amorphous nature
of silica materials. The three resonances at ca. 90, 100, and 110
ppm can be assigned to the Q2, Q3, and Q4 sites, respectively, where n in Qn (n = 0–4) denotes the number of neighboring
silicon atoms that are connected via an oxygen bridge. The Q3 sites come from the structure units including Si(OSi)3(OH), and the Q2 sites come from Si(OSi)2(OH)2. Thus, it can be seen that the different textural characteristics
of the samples are not related to their nature.

The composition
of SCMs was determined by ICP–AES. The results
are shown in Table 2. The contents of NiO and MoO3 in As-SCM are 6.8 and 11.6,
respectively, while the contents of NiO and MgO in Cl-SCM are 4.5
and 9.9, respectively. These results provide the almost quantitative
deposition of metals.

NiMg/MCF/Al2O3	56.4	29.2	4.5	 	9.9	
3.2 As Removal Procedure
For the catalytic
tests in flow mode, SCM NiMo/SBA-15/Al2O3 was
chosen because it showed the greatest activity in removing arsenic-containing
compounds during the preliminary studies.44 The comparison of the catalytic activities of different SCMs based
on mesoporous materials and Al2O3 is shown in
the Supporting Information (Table S1).

Based on the data presented, the optimal temperature for reducing
the arsenic content in middle distillates can be considered as 340–380
°C. Carrying out the reaction at higher temperatures can indeed
lead to a more complete decomposition of arsenic-containing compounds;
however, this condition can also lead to the side processes, such
as cracking, aromatization, and so forth.

The hydrotreating
process of middle distillates to remove arsenic
compounds was carried out in a flow-type laboratory setup (Figure
S1, Supporting Information). In the continuously
heated feed tank E-1, 500 mL of the diesel fraction containing arsenic
(in the form of triphenylarsine) in an amount of 5 ppm was placed.
Next, in the M-1 mixer heated to 150 °C, the diesel fraction
was fed at a given speed, as well as hydrogen, through the regulator.
From the M-1 mixer, the hydrogen and feedstock entered the R-1 reactor.
After reaching the set temperature, the output mode was operated for
3 h.

As follows from the analytical data, at a temperature of
340 °C,
the amount of arsenic in the product decreases to less than 1 ppm
(Figure 3). Further,
the pressure in the system was varied to a temperature of 360 °C
and LHSV of 2 h–1. In this case, a decrease in the
content of arsenic in the product to less than 1 ppm was also observed.
At a pressure of 6 MPa, a temperature of 360 °C, and an LHSV
of 2 h–1, the content of arsenic decreased to 0.09
ppm, which is comparable to the value obtained at a temperature of
360 °C (5 MPa, 1 h–1). Then, the LHSV varied
from 1 to 4 h–1 at a fixed pressure of 5 MPa and
a temperature of 360 °C. The largest degree of As removal can
be achieved at an LHSV of 1 h–1, and a decent removal
is at 2 h–1. The results of all the tests on the
catalytic removal of As are presented in Figure 2. It can be seen that the residual content
of arsenic does not exceed 1 ppm in all samples.

Figure 3 Comparative tests of
Ni–Mo/SBA-15/Al2O3 under the different
technological conditions.

The synthesized SCMs based on mesoporous materials such as SBA-15
show a high activity in reducing the arsenic content in the diesel
fraction. In addition, the hydrotreatment under mild conditions (340–380
°C, 5 MPa H2, and LHSV—1–4 h–1) leads to the almost complete removal of arsenic from the diesel
fraction.

3.3 As and Cl Removal Procedure
In this
process, the sorption of chlorine and arsenic compounds occurs in
the pores of the catalyst of the guard bed. The process was carried
out on SCMs that contain the active components (Ni–Mo) and
(Ni–Mg) on the mesoporous supports. SCM NiMg/MCF/Al2O3 was used to absorb chlorine, and NiMo/SBA-15/Al2O3 was used to absorb arsenic. These catalysts
were placed in a flow reactor in the form of two layers. The preparation
stage for the SCMs consists of 5 cm3 of NiMg/MCF/Al2O3 extrudate (top) and 5 cm3 of NiMo/SBA-15/Al2O3 extrudate (bottom). The total volume of the
guard bed catalyst was 10 cm3. The technological scheme
of the setup is shown in Figure 3 (the same as in the As removal).

The tests showed
that after 16 h at 360 °C, 5 MPa, and LHSV = 2 h–1, the removal process for arsenic and chlorine compounds occurs almost
quantitatively (Figure 4). After 4 h of the process, the contents of arsenic and chlorine
decrease to levels of 0.3 and 0.5 ppm, respectively, which fully meet
the requirements detailed in the technical specifications. Generally,
the activity of the SCMs increases with the time in stream, reaches
the maximum between 12 and 16 h, and then remains nearly constant
during the experiments. This observation indicates that the stability
of NiMo/SBA-15/Al2O3 and NiMg/MCF/Al2O3 SCMs under the experimental conditions is sufficient
to remove As and Cl contaminants from middle distillates.

Figure 4 Dependence
of the As and Cl removal on reaction time.

3.4 Catalyst Characterization
The sulfidation
process occurs during the catalytic removal of As (and Cl in the combined
process) as the autosulfidation with sulfur-containing substances,
including dibenzothiophene and others. The Ni–Mo/SBA-15/Al2O3 SCM after As–Cl removal was characterized
by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). The HRTEM images of the sorption-catalytic
materials after catalytic As-removal are shown in Figure 2B. The parallel lines running
across the nanoparticles correspond to typical MoS2-layered
structures. The crystalline structure with a periodicity of ∼1–2
Å corresponds to the NiSx structure.
The length and stacked-layer number of the MoS2 particles
in the sample were analyzed, and the results are shown in Figure 5. The average values
were estimated by counting more than 100 crystallites. The average
number of layers per slab N̅ is close to 5
with an average length of L̅ = 4.6 nm. The
size of the sulfide particles partially correlates with the porous
structure of the support. The multistacked crystallites are primarily
located in the mesopore channels. The average pore size of SBA-15
is approximately 10 nm, which is enough for the large crystallites.
This result reveals that the Ni–Mo particles of the SCM are
essentially the same as those in conventional sulfided catalysts,
so the catalyst poisoning (sorption of As) would be effective as well.

Figure 5 Particle
length and number of slab distributions for the sulfided
catalyst NiMo/SBA-15/Al2O3.

To obtain more information on the metal sulfide active phases,
XRD was performed. The wide-angle X-ray pattern of the supported NiMo
catalyst after As–Cl removal is shown in Figure 6A. The wide-angle X-ray pattern of the sulfided
sample exhibits broad reflections belonging to the MoS2 phase. However, no signals belonging to nickel sulfide are observed.
The absence and broadening of certain reflections associated with
the sulfided phases suggest that the supported Ni and Mo sulfide species
on SBA-15 were less than 5 nm. This hypothesis was confirmed by HRTEM
of the samples after catalysis. Statistical analysis of the sulfided
MoS2 particles shows that the average length of the sulfides L̅ was equal to 4.6 nm.

Figure 6 XRD patterns of (A) NiMo/SBA-15/Al2O3 and
(B) NiMg/MCF/Al2O3 after catalysis.

The X-ray pattern of the supported NiMg/MCF/Al2O3 catalyst after As–Cl removal is shown in Figure 6B. No chloride phase
was detected because of the low concentration. The broad reflections
belong to the γ-Al2O3 phase and the MgAl2O4 spinel.47 No signals
associated with the nickel phase are observed as well.

To examine
the state of the Ni, Mo, Mg, and S species on the supports
after catalysis, XPS was performed on samples Ni–Mo/SBA-15/Al2O3 and NiMg/MCF/Al2O3. The
results are reported in Table 3. For both SCMs, the Ni 2p3/2 and S 2p binding
energies are the same and are equal to 852.6 ± 0.3 and 161.9
eV, respectively, indicating that the states of Ni and S are not modified
by the nature of the catalyst. With regard to molybdenum, the deconvolution
of the Mo XPS spectrum yields Mo4+ corresponding to MoS2 via a completed sulfidation process. Arsenic possesses a
low photoionization cross section, and along with the low concentration,
the absence of As peaks seems to be correct. In the case of NiMg/MCF/Al2O3, the Mg spectrum indicates the formation of
a certain oxide (according to the XRD analysis, it belongs to the
MgAl2O4 spinel).

The elemental analysis of SCMs after catalysis was performed by
ICP–AES. The data are presented in Table 4. The analysis demonstrated that the sorption
of As and Cl substances is almost complete. It is important that the
guard bed shows a long catalyst life. There is no activity loss in
the combined As–Cl removal. The good catalyst life of the double-layered
guard bed is one of the key factors for practical applications.

4 Conclusions
The
SCMs based on SBA-15 and MCF mesoporous silica demonstrated
a high efficiency in As and Cl removal. The results obtained from
this work clearly showed that Ni–Mo and Ni–Mg SCMs containing
mesoporous materials displayed excellent catalytic properties for
a long time under mild conditions (T = 360 °C
and P = 5.0 MPa H2) and can be used with
the guard bed technology. Thus, this guard bed catalyst had an advantage
in the reduction of impurities. As a result, it can be used to prevent
irreversible poisoning of the main hydrotreating catalysts.
