In this study, Co-doped TiO2 was prepared successfully
using a solvothermal method with trimesic acid (H3BTC)
as an organic framework to form the Co-doped Ti metal–organic
framework (Co-doped Ti-MOF). By thermally decomposing the Co-doped
Ti-MOF in air, the framework template was removed, and porous Co-doped
TiO2 was obtained. The crystal structure of the material
was analyzed using X-ray diffraction. The morphology was examined
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focused ion beam SEM.
The large specific surface area was determined to be 135.95 m2 g–1 using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
theory. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy verified the presence
of Ti–O–Ti and Co–O vibrations in the as-prepared
sample. Furthermore, the results of UV–vis spectroscopy showed
that doping with Co remarkably improved the absorption ability of
Ti-MOF toward the visible-light region with a band gap energy of 2.38
eV (λ = 502 nm). Steady-state photoluminescence and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy were conducted to illustrate the improvement
of electron transfer in the doped material further. The optimum power
conversion efficiency of solar cells using 1 wt % Co-doped TiO2 as an electron transport layer was found to be 15.75%, while
that of solar cells using commercial dyesol TiO2 is only
14.42%.

1 Introduction
In
the past few years, the development of renewable and clean energy
resources, such as wind power, biomass power, hydropower, and solar
energy, has been considered as a viable solution to satisfy ever-increasing
energy demands. Among such energy sources, solar energy, which is
the most abundant and benign resource, can be utilized for generating
electricity without producing greenhouse gases, harmful byproducts,
and noise pollution.1,2 Depending on the photosensitive
material layer used, there are three major types of solar cells. Crystalline
silicon cells form the first generation of solar cells, which have
high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability but are expensive
to manufacture. The second generation includes thin-film solar cells,
which are more cost-effective but also less efficient than the first-generation
cells. The third-generation solar cells include organic thin-film/polymer
solar cells, dye-sensitized/perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and quantum
dot solar cells.3−5 Notably, PSCs have received considerable attention
owing to their high PCE; abundant elemental constituents; and low-cost,
low-temperature, and scalable fabricating process.6−11

Typically, a single PSC has a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)
substrate/hole
block layer/electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite layer/hole transport
layer (HTL)/metal electrode structure. ETLs can be fabricated from
different materials, such as TiO2, SnO2, Al2O3, ZnO, or ZrO2. Among these photocatalysts,
TiO2 is one of the best semiconductors for use as an electron
transport material (ETM) in PSCs, owing to its superior structural
stability, safety, and low cost.12−14 However, the band gap
energy of commercial TiO2 is approximately 3.3 eV (λ
= 380 nm), which lies in the range of ultraviolet radiation. This
relatively large band gap causes difficulty in exciting and injecting
the electrons, which leads to inefficient electron transportation
and consequently poor electrical conductivity.

One way to address
this issue is to dope the semiconductor with
metals to reduce the band gap; this enhances sunlight absorbance as
well as the transportation of electrons in TiO2 from the
perovskite layer. Moreover, metal-doped TiO2 slows down
the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs owing
to the influence of the trap states and the electronic structure of
TiO2. Among the various metallic dopants (e.g., Ni, Mg,
Co, Fe, Ca, and Zn), Co has been considered as a suitable candidate
for incorporation in TiO2 structures as it considerably
reduces the band gap energy of TiO2, leading to increased
light absorption. More importantly, doping with Co facilitates the
generation of massive distortions and the accompanying defects resulting
from the presence of Co atoms in TiO2 lattices.15−18 Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are constructed
using various metal ions and organic linkers, have been utilized in
various fields including catalysts, supercapacitors, purification,
sensors, and gas storage19−23 owing to their unique properties, such as a well-ordered porous
structure, high thermal stability, ultralow density, and large internal
surface area.24−27 As a consequence, MOFs and MOF-derived materials have been widely
employed as a new strategy for the future design of enhanced PSCs.
For instance, ZIF-8 materials have been used as an interlayer between
the TiO2 and perovskite layer in order to increase the
grain size and smooth morphology of the perovskite.25 Meanwhile, some innovative materials such as Zr-MOF, In-MOF,
and POM@Cu-BTC were used as an HTL modifier to enhance efficiency
and stability for PSCs.28−30 For ETL fabrication, nTi-MOF
was incorporated with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl
ester (PCBM) to achieve outstanding performance and excellent durability.27

Hence, in this study, Co-doped TiO2 with MOFs as a template
for the optimized contents was prepared using the solvothermal method.
Co-doped Ti-MOFs were constructed in such a way that Ti, Co clusters,
and organic linkers would be stitched together. Subsequently, the
frameworks were removed by calcination in air to convert Ti to TiO2. The obtained material had a porous structure, both internally
and on the surface, and was applied to PSCs as a porous ETL that is
compared with commercial dyesol TiO2.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a presents
the XRD patterns of TiO2 and Co-doped TiO2 powder
recorded from 20 to 70°. The XRD peaks at 25.847, 38.298, 48.402,
54.451, 55.645, and 63.095° were assigned to the characteristic
peaks of TiO2 anatase (ICSD, no. 75-1537). A graphitic
carbon reflection at a 2θ of 23° was observed in the samples
after annealing, which was presumably derived from the calcination
of the organic linker at 400 °C.31,32 There were
no impurity peaks in the patterns of Co-doped TiO2 when
compared with those of pure TiO2, implying that the doping
with Co2+ ions did not change the original TiO2 structure. However, the peak positions shifted slightly to the left
owing to the presence of the dopant, indicating the substitution of
Co2+ ions in the TiO2 lattice.33,34 Moreover, the increase in peak sharpness and intensity that was
observed in the pattern of the Co-doped TiO2 implies an
enhancement of crystal growth. The crystalline sizes of the TiO2 and Co-doped TiO2 particles were estimated to
be 9 and 10 nm, respectively, by using the Debye–Scherrer equation
with the width of the (101) planes. Besides, the peaks in the range
of 10–12° (the inset in Figure 1a) were supposed to be the formation of crystalline
Ti-BTC as mentioned in previous research studies.27,35

Figure 1 (a)
XRD patterns and (b) FTIR spectra of TiO2 and 1
wt % Co-doped TiO2. Inset shows XRD of Ti-BTC.

The FTIR spectra of TiO2 and Co-doped TiO2 were analyzed and are shown in Figure 1b. The peaks at 3600 and 1620 cm–1 were attributed to the O–H stretching and H–O–H
bending vibrations of the adsorbed water molecules, respectively.
The weak peak that appeared at 2920 cm–1 was assigned
to the C–H stretching vibration of the residual organic groups.
The strong absorption indicated by the prominent peaks between 450
and 500 cm–1 characterized the vibrations of Ti–O–Ti
bonding. The slight shift in this peak to the right in the Co-doped
TiO2 sample indicated the presence of Co–O bonds
due to the replacement of Co2+ at the Ti4+ sites
in the TiO2 lattice. This may cause charge neutrality oxygen
vacancies, leading to lattice defects.36

Figure 2a illustrates
the optical absorption spectra of undoped and 1 wt % Co-doped TiO2 particles in the range of 200–800 nm obtained by UV–vis
measurement. It can be observed that the onset of the absorption spectra
of TiO2 and 1 wt % Co-doped TiO2 appeared around
385 and 502 nm, respectively, implying a redshift when using the Co
dopant. According to the equation Eg =
1240/λonset, the band gap energies of TiO2 and 1 wt % Co-doped TiO2 were 3.22 and 2.38 eV, respectively.
These values were fitted with the absorption spectra, as shown in Figure 2b. The decrease in
the band gap energy of the doped sample could be assigned to the defect
structure (oxygen ion vacancies) due to the substitution of Co2+ at Ti4+ sites in the original TiO2 lattice, which introduced additional energy states near the valence
band.36,37 As a result, the enhanced electron charge
transfer between the conduction and valence bands of 1 wt % Co-doped
TiO2 was expected to achieve a more effective injection
from the perovskite layer to the ETM.

Figure 3a illustrates
that a smooth ETL could be derived by spin coating as-prepared 1 wt
% Co-doped TiO2 paste, which was comparable with commercial
dyesol TiO2. Figure 3b shows the surface morphology and pore structure of 1 wt
% Co-doped TiO2. The results show that the Co-doped TiO2 particles prepared based on the MOF structure using the BTC
template had a highly porous structure both inside and on the surface
owing to the removal of the template. The elemental maps of C, O,
Ti, and Co shown in Figure 3c confirm that Ti and Co were uniformly distributed in the
material. Moreover, the EDX elemental spectrum in Figure 3d shows that the cobalt content
of the selected area matched well with its theoretical loadings (i.e.,
1 wt %). The small amount of carbon present in the sample is in line
with the XRD result.

Figure 4a shows
the PL spectra of the perovskite films using TiO2 and Co-doped
TiO2 as the ETM at the wavelengths ranging from 700 to
860 nm with light excitation at 540 nm. The intensity of the photoluminescence
peak at 760 nm decreased substantially in Co-doped TiO2 compared to the TiO2 sample, suggesting that cobalt doping
can reduce the recombination of electron–hole pairs on the
surface of TiO2.16 The EIS curves
are performed to further probe the improvement in charge transport
and charge recombination behavior due to doping cobalt as shown in Figure 4b. The charge transport
resistance (Rtrans) and charge recombination
resistance (Rrec) of devices using undoped
and 1 wt % Co-doped TiO2 were determined from the diameter
of the semicircle of the associated Nyquist plot. The significant
decrease in Rtrans and Rrec confirmed the advantages of the dopant in boosting
electron transport and alleviating electron–hole recombination,
in agreement with UV and PL measurements.

The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of TiO2 and Co-doped TiO2 at 77.418
K (in Figure 5) exhibit
a capillary condensation
phenomenon in the pores at a relative pressure above 0.45, indicating
the presence of a porous interior structure. Using the same synthesis
method, Co-doped TiO2 was found to have a larger specific
surface area than TiO2 (BET values of 135.95 and 111.94
m2 g–1). The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) distribution curves (in Figure S2) show that the average pore diameters of the Co-doped TiO2 and TiO2 particles were 6.79 and 4.74 nm, respectively,
while the pore volumes of Co-doped TiO2 and TiO2 were 0.25 and 0.14 cm3 g–1, respectively.

Table 1 summarizes
the photovoltaic parameters of the devices that use dyesol TiO2, the prepared TiO2, and Co-doped TiO2 samples as different ETLs by reverse scan. Compared with the PSCs
using dyesol and the prepared TiO2, the cells using 1 wt
% Co-doped TiO2 not only achieved the highest performance
(average PCE of 15.34% and maximum PCE of 15.75% accompanied with Jsc of 24.078 mA cm–2 and FF
of 64.949%) but also showed excellent reproducibility, which was comparable
with dyesol (in Figure S3). The remarkably
enhanced performance of 1 wt % Co-doped TiO2 was ascribed
to two factors: (i) its interior and surficial morphologies obtained
from thermal decomposition of the MOF template and (ii) improvement
in electron transfer by doping with Co, as mentioned earlier. However,
a further increase in the Co concentration over 1 wt % resulted in
deterioration of the performance of the PSCs, as shown in Figure 6, probably owing
to the formation of secondary impurity phases (or incorporation of
Co ions at the interstitial sites) as explained in previous research.37

The hysteresis of PSCs is demonstrated through the
difference of J–V curves
between reverse and forward
scanning directions (in Figure 7), and the key photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that
the PCEs of dyesol TiO2 and 1 wt % Co-doped TiO2 devices in reverse–forward sweeps were found to be 15.75–15.60%
and 14.42–14.02%, respectively. This presents the negligible
hysteresis behavior, implying the efficient electron transfer from
perovskite.27

3 Conclusions
By using the solvothermal
method, Co-doped TiO2 samples
were synthesized successfully. PSCs were also fabricated using the
Co-doped TiO2 samples as efficient ETLs. Compared with
commercial dyesol TiO2, the solar cells based on the prepared
materials exhibited enhanced performance. An excellent PCE of up to
15.75% was obtained with an open-circuit voltage of 1.027 V, a current
density of 24.078 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 64.95%.

(MABr), methylammonium hydrochloride (MAHCl), and titanium nanoparticle
paste (18NR-T) were procured from Great Cell Solar Co.

4.2 Preparation of Co-Doped TiO2 Powder
Co-doped
TiO2 particles were synthesized using a solvothermal
method, as illustrated in Figure S1. Trimesic
acid (H3BTC) was dissolved in methanol by stirring to obtain
a transparent and homogeneous mixture. Then, titanium(IV) isopropoxide
was added in drops to the mixture for 20 min. The determined amounts
of CoCl2·6H2O in methanolic solution were
slowly added to the mixture and stirred for 30 min. Afterward, the
obtained blend was transferred to an autoclave and treated at 150
°C for 24 h. Subsequently, the solid Co-doped Ti-BTC was washed
with the cosolvent (deionized water/ethanol) several times and collected
through centrifugation. Finally, the Co-doped TiO2 powder
was obtained after drying at 60 °C and calcination at 400 °C
for 5 h in air to remove the organic residues.

4.3 Preparation
of Co-Doped TiO2 Paste
Co-doped TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing the as-prepared
particles with ethanol, water, and acetic acid using ball milling
for 24 h. Subsequently, α-terpineol and ethyl cellulose were
added to the mixture and ultrasonicated for 1 h. The paste was obtained
after evaporating the solvent while stirring at 80 °C.

4.4 Solar Cell Fabrication
To fabricate
the solar cell, the FTO substrates were thoroughly cleaned using an
ultrasonic bath for 20 min with acetone, isopropanol, deionized water,
and ethanol. A TiO2 blocking layer with titanium diisopropoxide
bis(acetylacetone) in ethanol (1:10 v/v ratio) was applied on the
washed FTO, using a spin-coater at 2000 rpm for 40 s. After spinning,
the substrates were placed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min
and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room
temperature, the porous layer with Co-doped TiO2 paste
in the solvent mixture (3.5:1 wt/wt of α-terpineol/2-methoxy
ethanol) (1 wt % paste:5 wt % solvent mixture) was deposited on the
FTO/block-TiO2 film by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 20
s. Subsequently, the film was annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The
perovskite layer was deposited by performing a two-step spin-coating
procedure inside a glovebox under a N2 atmosphere. In the
first step, a 1.3 M PbI2 solution (600 mg of PbI2 dissolved in 950 μL of DMF and 50 μL of DMSO) was spin-coated
at 2000 rpm for 30 s. In the second step, a 1 mL solution of FAI (60
mg), MABr (6 mg), and MAHCl (6 mg) in isopropanol was coated onto
the PbI2 layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s (loading time, 20 s).
Then, the film was placed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min.
A spiro-OMeTAD solution (84 mg of spiro-OMeTAD dissolved in 1 mL of
chlorobenzene, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine,
and 17.5 μL of LI-TSFI (520 mg of LI-TSFI in 1 mL of acetonitrile))
was applied onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Finally,
100 nm of Au metal as a cation electrode was deposited on top of the
film by thermal evaporation.

4.5 Measurements and Characterization
The crystal structures of the materials were analyzed using X-ray
diffraction (XRD; Rigaku DMAX 2200, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15406 nm) at scan rates of 0.2° min–1 (in 5–15° range) and 5° min–1 (in 20–70° range). Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis;
Agilent 8453, USA) light absorption was used to assess the absorption
properties of the prepared materials. The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR; Vertex 70, Bruker, Germany) spectra of the material were recorded
to verify the doping-induced presence of the functional groups. The
morphology and structure of the particles were determined using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4700, Japan) with energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) and focused ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM; Hitachi, Japan). The
steady-state photoluminescence (PL; QuantaMaster TM 50 PTI, USA) spectra
were determined to reveal the enhancement by cobalt doping. Also,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS; Bio-Logic Science Instruments,
France) was carried out in dark conditions with frequencies from 20
mHz to 200 kHz, a bias of 0 V, and an amplitude of 20 mV. The specific
surface area of the materials was confirmed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption
measurements based on Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory,
performed using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. A sun simulator
(Polaromix K201, Solar simulator LAB 50, McScience K3000) with an
irradiance of 100 mW cm–2 was used to provide simulated
solar irradiation.
