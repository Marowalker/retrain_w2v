This
work highlights a facile green route for the one-step synthesis
of iron oxide core–double-shell nanoparticles (NPs) and aluminum
phosphide (AlP) nanosheets by pulsed laser ablation of the mineral
turquoise target from Nishapur in the presence of an ethanol solvent.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron
diffraction pattern, and field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray mapping revealed
the formation of NPs with a typical core@double-shell structure in
which crystalline α-Fe2O3 (iron oxide)
formed the core, while SiO2 (quartz) and (K, H3O)Fe3(SO4)2(OH6) (jarosite)
participated as the inner and outer shell, respectively. However,
the application of laser ablation on the turquoise phase of the target
led to the formation of AlP nanosheets which was confirmed by the
X-ray diffraction patterns and FESEM images. Strong absorption of
the vein-ablated species in the UV region (250–360 nm) was
the characteristic feature of α-Fe2O3 and
jarosite phases, while the absorption band at 250–300 nm for
the turquoise-ablated species was related to the presence of Cu compound
species and also the α-Fe2O3 phase in
the sample. Photoluminescence emission spectra for the vein-ablated
species depicted a peak centered at 370 nm, while a peak located at
364 nm was ascribed to the turquoise-ablated species. In particular,
these hybrid NPs with high purity and stability may offer new opportunities
for bio-applications such as anticancer agents and water/wastewater
applications.

Introduction
Recently, multifunctional
materials due to their wide range of
applications have attracted considerable attention.1 In hybrid nanostructures, different physical and chemical
properties of multiple components were integrated, which shows higher
device performance regarding their characteristic single components.2 Different hybrid materials were synthesized with
versatile structures and various components such as core–shell
and double-shell structures (Fe2O3@SiO2, Cux@Auy, Fe@Fe2O3@Si–C–O),3 doped metal oxides,4 noble metal-supported oxides,5 hierarchical
oxide heterostructures (TiO2/Fe2O3, ZnO/Fe2O3),6 and
so forth. Among the hybrid materials, iron oxide core–shell
or double-shell nanostructures motivated fundamental research because
of their potential applications in different areas including heavy
metal removal by adsorption or reduction,3c,7 drug
or biomolecules transport,8 pigment synthesis,9 hyperthermia,10 catalysis,11 as bio- and chemosensors,12 fine ceramics,13 and magnetic
resonance imaging.14 There have been various
synthetic strategies to fabricate iron oxide core–shell or
double-shell nanostructures such as the selective etching strategy,15 microemulsion,16 Stober
methods,17 and the ship-in-bottle approach.18 However, the methods listed above suffer from
the purity of the surface of nanostructures. While this impurity somewhat
blocks the benefit of bioconjugations of their surface. These approaches
usually are time-consuming
and require multiple high-temperature experimental steps. Additionally,
most of the procedures are not green processes because of the use
of toxic preservatives or chemical precursors; therefore, a well-established,
direct, and environmentally friendly process for the synthesis of
iron oxide hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) is still absent.

Liquid
phase-pulsed laser ablation (LP-PLA) is a unique and efficient
technique for the synthesis of complex nanostructures in a clean manner.19 The LP-PLA method has received considerable
attention in recent years as a simple and easily operable synthesis
technique for preparing the various nanomaterials free of contaminants.20 Ultrapure elements,21 oxide and non-oxide synthetic compositions,20a,22 and polymers and alloys23 are usually
used as the targets for the synthesis of different nanostructures
through the LP-PLA method. Minerals are not commonly used as targets
in the LP-PLA approach because of the presence of multiphase structures
in the mineral samples. Turquoise is a precious mineral which belongs
to a group of inorganic materials with at least six recognized members.24 The general formula of the turquoise group was
written as AB6(PO4)n(PO3)(OH)2n−1(OH)8·4H2O, wherein the A position was filled with
Cu2+ or Fe2+ as the most common constituent,
while Fe3+ and Al3+ are situated at the B position.25 Turquoise might also have veins running through
it. The wide veins on the surface of turquoise are undesired for high-quality
designing of jewelry pieces. The vein of Persian turquoise as our
mineral target encompasses three main phases of pyrite, quartz, and
jarosite.26 Inspired by this, with the
hypothesis of copossessing of iron oxide and silica, synthesis of
crystalline core–double-shell NPs through one-step LP-PLA approach,
low-cost Persian turquoise with wide veins, inappropriate for jewelry
applications, is proposed as a candidate for the ablation target without
any manipulation.

In this work, to the best of our knowledge,
for the first time,
as-prepared nanostructures from the laser ablation of Nishapur turquoise
in ethanol medium performed using Ce:Nd:YAG laser in the fundamental
wavelength (1064 nm) were studied. The hematite@quartz@jarosite core–double-shell
NPs, also produced for the first time through the laser ablation of
the vein phase of turquoise, consist of crystalline iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) core, silicon oxide (SiO2) inner
shell, and jarosite ((K,H3O)Fe3(SO4)2(OH6)) outer shell. Laser ablation of the
turquoise phase of the target also led to the synthesis of AlP nanosheets.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis, field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) in combination with energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping, high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM), and selected-area electron diffraction pattern
(SAED) were utilized for phase and morphological studies, while UV–vis–NIR
and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy used for characterization
of the optical properties of the synthesized nanostructures from laser
ablation of Nishapur turquoise in ethanol.

Results and Discussion
A schematic of the setup applied for the laser ablation experiments
is shown in Figure 1a. The laser beam was irradiated on the surface of the target going
through the 0.01 m height of the ethanol solvent. The composition
of the vein and turquoise phase of the target before and after the
laser ablation were characterized by XRD and is shown in Figure 1b. The vein of the
target before laser ablation was mostly composed of jarosite (JCPDS
file no. 00-036-0427), hematite (JCPDS file no. 00-033-0664), and
SiO2 (JCPDS file no. 00-046-1045), which were consistent
with the previously reported results of studies on Iranian turquoise.26 After laser ablation of the vein, the identified
phase was jarosite; however, the most four main peaks ascribed to
(101), (012), (021), and (113) planes showed lower intensity relative
to the intact vein target. This decreased intensity of the jarosite
phase after laser ablation of the vein was due to the lower crystallinity
of the as-synthesized product relative to the vein target produced
during the ablation process. The full width at half maximum (fwhm)
of peaks related to the (012) and (113) planes for the vein before
and after laser ablation was not meaningfully changed. A weak peak
related to the main peak ((104) planes) of the Fe2O3 phase, as well as two weak peaks corresponding to (101) and
(110) of the SiO2 phase were seen in the XRD pattern of
the dried solution produced after laser ablation. The presence of
iron in EDX analysis (Figure S1) and iron-containing
NPs in FESEM images (Figure 2h) confirmed the presence of the iron-containing phase in
the vein-ablated species. In the XRD of the turquoise phase of the
sample before laser ablation, the turquoise crystalline phase (JCPDS
file no. 96-500-0102) besides Fe2O3 (JCPDS file
no. 00-033-0664) and AlP (00-012-0470) phases were characterized.
After laser ablation of the turquoise phase, the most intensive peaks
of the turquoise phase, that is, the ones related to (111), (11̅1),
and (123) planes completely disappeared, while the three most intensive
peaks of the AlP phase, that is, the ones related to (111), (220),
and (311) planes were observed. In addition, the two most intensive
peaks of the Fe2O3 phase, that is, the ones
corresponding to (104) and (110) were identified.

and Fe2O3 NPs produced from the laser ablation
of the turquoise phase of the target. For the synthesis of all products,
ethanol as the liquid medium and laser wavelength was adjusted at
1064 nm.

Figure 2 FESEM images of the surface of target: (a,e)
overall top-view (before
(a) and after (e) laser ablation); (b,f) surface of the vein phase
(before (b) and after (f) laser ablation); (c,g) surface of the turquoise
phase (before (c) and after (g) laser ablation); (d,h) back-scattered
electron mode image of the turquoise phase (before (d) and after (h)

of iron-contained synthesized NPs on the surface of the turquoise
phase after the laser ablation process; for all of the irradiated
samples, morphological studies were done after 150 min noncontinuous
laser irradiation in the ethanol environment by Ce:Nd:YAG laser in
1064 nm wavelength.

The morphology of the
surface of the target before and after 150
min laser ablation (15 runs of 10 min laser irradiation) was studied
by FESEM, as depicted in Figure 2. The effect of the laser pulses irradiated on the
surface of the turquoise target in the ethanol medium could be compared
considering Figure 2a,e for the untreated and irradiated targets, respectively. These
overall views of the surface of the target could demonstrate the formation
of holes with different depths on the surface of the target (Figure 2e); the deep hole
is related to the intense ablation for 150 min (9 × 104 shots) in the vein phase versus the shallow cavity which indicated
mild ablation on the surface of the turquoise phase. The higher resolution
FESEM images of the vein and turquoise phases of the target before
laser ablation are shown in Figure 2b,c, respectively. The morphology of fragmented particles
of SiO2, Fe2O3, and jarosite constituted
in the vein phase is shown in Figure 2b, while an integrated surface structure of the turquoise
phase is observed in Figure 2c. The surface structures of the veins and turquoise phases
after laser ablation are also depicted in Figure 2f,g, respectively. Considering the FESEM
images of the surface of the target after laser ablation (Figure 2f,g), the ablation
dynamics of these two phases (vein and turquoise phases) during the
laser ablation were different. Regarding the ablation of the vein
phase by laser, through the formation of new phases, microreliefs
were formed on the surface of the vein phase. The microreliefs were
therefore modified by repeating the ablation procedure, and the craters
were observed in the formed septums and valleys of the vein phase
of the target. These reformed irregular microreliefs on the vein phase
of the stone, after 150 min of noncontinuous irradiation, formed irregular
microchannels and are shown in Figure 2f. It could be understood from the FESEM image of the
vein of the target after laser ablation that the deformation of the
surface and the formation of the pore-like structure and incomplete
pores were arising from laser-induced heating of the ablation target,
subsequent melting, and resolidification of the surface (Figure S2a,b). Resolidified materials were seen
over the surface of the vein phase in these images. EDX analysis of
different regions from the vein phase (Figure S1a–c) clearly revealed the presence of Fe and Si in
the vein phase. On the other hand, the FESEM image from the turquoise
surface after 150 min of noncontinuous irradiation showed an irregular
geometrical structure, without any effect of melting and resolidification
(Figure 2g). For a
more detailed study, EDX analysis and mapping were performed on the
turquoise phase of the target before and after laser ablation, respectively
(Figures S1d and S3), and confirmed the
presence of Cu, Al, P, Fe, and O as the major components of the turquoise
phase. However, additional EDX analyses showed that no quantities
of Si were present in this region in the accuracy range of the EDX
apparatus. These data were in good agreement with mineralogical analysis
using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) images from Nishapur
turquoise.27 The micro-fragmented particles
of SiO2, Fe2O3, and jarosite of the
vein phase were more exposed to phase transformation during the ablation
compared to the turquoise of the integrated structure. Basically,
because of the observed NIR optical band of the turquoise phase in
9300 cm–1 (∼1075 nm) resulting from the Fe(II)
band,24 the reflectance of the turquoise
phase in the NIR region (1064 nm laser wavelength) is higher than
that of the vein phase. This lower absorption in the turquoise phase
led to lower ablation efficiency of the turquoise phase (shown in Figure 2e) and led to the
change of ablation dynamics in this phase during laser ablation. The
surfaces of the turquoise phase before and after laser ablation (150
min noncontinuously irradiation) are illustrated in the back-scattered
electron mode FESEM images (Figure 2d,h). After laser ablation of the target, ablated products
in the form of nano- and microparticles transferred into the ethanol
environment, while some of the as-prepared particles already remained
on the surface of the stone target (Figure 2h).

The laser ablation product study
was conducted by selective laser
irradiation on the surface of the target. After 10 min of irradiation
on the vein phase, the liquid environment (ethanol) changed from colorless
to dark brown liquid. The color changes were attributed to the formation
of nanostructures containing iron oxide species. The turquoise phase
of the target was also exposed for 10 min to the laser pulses. FESEM
micrographs of the iron-containing NPs, prepared from the laser ablation
of the vein, as well as AlP nanosheets produced from the laser ablation
of the turquoise phase of the target are depicted in Figure 3a,b,c, respectively. The presence
of Cu compound-ablated species in the suspension produced from laser
ablation of the turquoise phase is seen in Figures 3c and S5a. Regarding
the size distribution of AlP nanosheets, in the applied laser fluence
of 178.3 J/cm2, broad-peak Gaussian extrapolation was adjusted
(inset in Figure S4b). The mean lateral
size of AlP nanosheets is measured as 30 nm, while the lateral size
of these nanosheets present in the solution was in the range of 30–210
nm. Iron-containing NPs were the bright spheres observed in Figure 3a. For the iron-containing
NPs (inset in Figure S4a), the same trend
was also seen. Most of the iron-containing NPs were synthesized in
relatively small size with the mean size around 20–30 nm; however,
substantial 20–550 nm size particles still existed in the suspension.
These broad-peak Gaussian distributions were also reported in other
laser-synthesized nanostructures.28 The
size of NPs depended on the gained fluency of the surface, which in
return depended on the temperature distribution produced on the target.
Subsequent pulses have produced different fluences on the surface;
in fact, the energy per pulse sensed by the surface depended on the
changing pulsed laser modifications of the solid surface as the ablation
continues.29 When the target was irradiated
initially on the nonprocessed surface, the temperature distribution
on the surface of the target was different from the same distribution
produced upon the laser pulses on the processed target. For the initially
stable pulses, the temperature profile was smooth. As a result, the
energy density (the laser fluence) on the surface of the target was
stable, which led to the narrow size distribution of NPs. During 10
min laser irradiation, the solid surface of the target absorbed the
short laser pulses and melted. Because of the heat transfer from this
molten layer of the target to the surrounding liquid layer, this liquid
layer heated up. As a result of the high pressure of the adjacent
layer that contacted the surface of the target, the microchannels
were formed. After the formation of these channels during 150 min
of noncontinuous irradiation on the surface (Figure 2f), numerous hot spots located at the channels
altered the temperature profile and changed the fluence distribution,
thus finally leading to the synthesis of NPs with more broad size
distribution. Furthermore, in nanosecond laser ablation, multiple
size distribution occurred because of the radiation-related target
heating effect. In the nanosecond laser ablation, because of the electron–phonon
relaxation process,30 the lattice temperature
started to increase. When the absorbed energy on the target was sufficiently
high, the nanoclusters and atoms were formed. These ablated nanoclusters
and atoms tended to agglomerate during or after the laser pulse irradiation.
In nanosecond laser ablation, the target itself was heated by the
laser-produced plasma and also by the radiation as a direct consequence
of the heat diffusion time being much shorter than the laser pulse.
This later condition resulted in slow cooling of particles and thus
led to the agglomeration of these particles.31 The radiation-related target heating effect was strong in the nanosecond
and microsecond radiations, wherein the ablated crater was surrounded
by the heat-affect zone, leading to the release of large droplets
of the materials.32

and iron-silicon of the particle shown in (e), respectively, EDX mapping
images for iron oxide-silicon oxide LP-PLA generated core–double-shell
particles produced in ethanol, showing the oxidized iron core and
also silicon oxide shell.

The FESEM image in combination with the EDX line scan on a single
particle is shown in Figure 3d–f. EDX mappings of the same particle regarding the
presence of O and Fe–Si were also shown in Figure 3d,f, respectively. The FeOx@SiOx core–shell
structure is clearly distinguishable by the defined phase boundary
formed with a decrease of silicon with a simultaneous increase of
iron in the center. This trend of iron and silicon variations correspondent
with the presence of oxygen, depicted in FESEM and EDX (line and mapping)
results, confirms the iron oxide enrichment in the core and silicon
oxide in the shell. The diameter of the core and the thickness of
the shell for some core–shell structure of these particles
have been shown in Figure S2c,d. Considering
the FESEM images, the core size of these particles changed from 60
to 410 nm and the shell size (inner and outer shell together) changed
from 20 to 150 nm.

For a more detailed analysis of the particle,
HRTEM analysis was
done on the prepared particles. While FESEM images could not recognize
more than two layers (recognition of first and second shell aside),
HRTEM images disclosed the presence of two shells and a core. In fact,
the outer shell was composed of two different compositions revealed
by electron diffraction of the particles, showing the formation of
core–double-shell particles. Figure 4a showed a bright-field HRTEM image, confirming
the formation of multiple size distributions of particles with a core–double-shell
structure by 1064 nm laser ablation in ethanol. The measurement on
TEM images indicated that the typical core and shell (inner and outer
together) sizes were in the range of 5–205 and 2–145
nm, respectively. The multiple size distributions of particles illustrated
using FESEM images were discussed (Figure S4a) in the previous section. A particle with a core-double-shell structure
is shown in Figure 4b, in which the outer shell was formed within an identical thickness,
although the inner shell was not formed with equal thickness. The
dark core was FeOx with about 202 nm diameter
and the mean thickness of the inner shell of SiOx was 82 nm; however, the thinner bright outer shell showed
a thickness of 3 nm. To identify the specific compositions of the
as-synthesized core–double-shell particles, also evaluation
of the crystallinity, inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) was redrawn
(Figure 4c) and also
SAED characterization from different areas of the sample was done
(Figures 4d and S6a,b). The radial profile (circular integration
of intensity in reciprocal space) of the diffraction patterns is shown
in Figures 4e and S6c,d. For the core, a lattice fringe of 0.27
nm corresponding to the (104) planes of α-Fe2O3 (bottom left inset in Figure 4c) was characterized, while for the inner shell, the
measured lattice fringe was 0.25 nm (was marked at the upright of
the inset in Figure 4c) which is related to (110) planes of SiO2. The lattice
fringe of 0.57 nm on the top-left inset in Figure 4c illustrated a characteristic interlayer
spacing of 0.57 nm for the jarosite phase (JCPDS file no. 00-036-0427)
corresponding to (003) planes. The SAED patterns (Figures 4d and S6a,b) showed the crystalline planes of the α-Fe2O3 core ((202), (223), (4̅2̅4), (5̅01),
(5̅1̅5)), and SiO2 inner shell ((101), (202),
(211), (002), (400), (311) planes), and jarosite outer shell related
to (511), (431), (217), (330), (4̅3̅8), ((4̅05),
(146), and (407) planes), which were in good agreement with HRTEM
inverse FFT images.

Optical Properties of Laser-Synthesized
Particles and Nanosheets
The optical absorption properties
of laser-synthesized particles
and turquoise phase-ablated species at room temperature were studied
by UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy (Figure 5a). As shown in Figure 5a, the spectrum of the suspension containing
AlP nanosheets and Cu compounds showed broad absorption in the range
of 250–300 nm with the maximum peak at 270 nm. Because of the
presence of Cu-ablated specious in the turquoise phase of the target
after the laser ablation of the turquoise phase (Figures S5a and 3c), the absorption
spectrum for this sample was intensified in the UV region. The UV
absorption of Cu compounds usually was in the visible region and changed
to the UV region with quantum confinement effect enhancement.33 In addition, UV absorption of the sample was
observed because of the direct-charge transfer transition of O2– 2p → Fe3+ 3d of α-Fe2O3 in the turquoise phase-ablated species. However,
in Figure 5a, the same
spectrum accomplished on the vein phase-ablated species was seen;
for the vein phase-ablated species containing the core–double-shell
particles, there is a strong absorption region including 250–360
nm corresponding to the direct-charge transfer transition of O2– 2p → Fe3+ 3d of α-Fe2O3. Another strong absorption in the visible region
due to an indirect transition of Fe3+ 3d → 3d was
seen.34 Furthermore, because ofthe presence
of the jarosite phase, UV absorption for the vein phase-ablated species
sample was strong and broad.35

nanostructures produced from laser ablation of the turquoise stone
target in the ethanol environment from bottom to top: ethanol as the
baseline, turquoise phase-ablated species containing α-Fe2O3 and Cu compounds besides AlP nanosheets, and
vein phase-ablated species containing α-Fe2O3@SiO2@jarosite core–double-shell NPs, (b)
PL spectra from bottom to top: the vein phase of the target before
laser ablation, vein phase-ablated species after 10 min laser ablation
of the vein phase in ethanol, turquoise phase of the target before
laser ablation, and turquoise phase-ablated species containing α-Fe2O3 and Cu compounds besides AlP nanosheets produced
from 10 min laser ablation of the turquoise phase of the target.

Figure 5b depicts
the PL spectra of both laser-generated nanostructures from the 10
min laser ablation of the turquoise mineral in ethanol (vein and turquoise)
and the target (vein and turquoise phases) before ablation. All samples
were excited at 270 nm at room temperature. The emission band centered
at 370 nm (3.35 eV) is observed in the vein phase-ablated species
prepared from laser ablation of the vein phase of the turquoise stone.
This luminescence is due to electron transition within α-Fe2O3 and can be observed even with the bare eye at
room temperature. The emission band centered at 364 nm (3.41 eV) is
observed in the turquoise phase-ablated species, which indicated the
copper compound emission in these ablated species. The presence of
these compounds was previously illustrated using the FESEM image in
combination EDX analysis (Figures 3c and S5a). The presence
of α-Fe2O3 can intensify the emission
band in the UV region. The UV emission peak in 364 nm for the turquoise
phase-ablated species was related to the recombination of electron–hole
pairs in free excitons.36 These PL properties
of the suspension were in agreement with the PL emission of Cu compounds
and also α-Fe2O3 emission bands in the
UV region.36,37 The blue emission band of the
sample (led to show the blue color of these compounds) is seen, as
shown in Figure S4, when this sample was
excited at 430 nm at room temperature. The PL spectrum of the turquoise
phase-ablated species in Figure S4 showed
the emission band located in 462 nm (led to the blue color emission)
and 492 nm related to cyan color (a deep greenish-blue color) emission
and also a weak peak in 504 nm corresponding to green color emission
of these turquoise phase-ablated species. Intriguingly, the fwhm of
the emission spectra for both nanostructures synthesized from laser
ablation of the vein and the turquoise phase of the target (i.e.,
vein phase and turquoise phases after LP-PLA) is narrower than the
nonablated samples (i.e., vein and turquoise phases before LP-PLA).
Basically, when the size of the nanostructures is less than 30 nm,
the PL phenomenon is observed because of the quantum confinement effect.38 For the bulk material, the PL spectra are not
observable because of the forbidden optical transition.39 In the current study, the effect of the size
of the turquoise phase-ablated species and the core–double-shell
NPs needs to be considered. Furthermore, the narrower spectrum in
the turquoise phase-ablated species and core–double-shell NPs
indicates higher uniformity of these nanostructure emission energies
and thus higher size uniformity of these nanostructures compared to
the untreated turquoise and vein-phase structures.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the presented work describes a suitable one-pot,
one-step, “green” synthesis route for the selective
laser synthesis of high-purity core–double-shell magnetic NPs
and AlP nanosheets from the selective laser ablation of the mineral
turquoise target in the ethanol environment. HRTEM and SAED analyses
show that these core–double-shell NPs are composed of the hematite
core and quartz inner shell and jarosite outer shell. Regarding the
TEM images, the mean diameter of the hematite core is measured as
27 nm, while the mean quartz shell thickness is 9 nm. However, the
nanosheet formation has been confirmed using FESEM images with a lateral
size of 30–210 ± 6 nm. UV–vis–NIR absorption
for core–double-shell NPs shows strong absorption in the UV
region (250–360 nm) because of α-Fe2O3 and jarosite and phases, while turquoise phase-ablated species
have a peak located at 270 nm related to the presence of Cu compounds
in the turquoise phase. The PL emission of core–double-shell
NPs at 370 nm is due to the electronic transition within the iron
oxide (α-Fe2O3), while for the turquoise
phase-ablated species, it is located at 364 nm and related to the
presence of Cu compounds and α-Fe2O3 phases
in the turquoise phase.

Methods
LP-PLA Conditions and Sample
Preparation
A Ce:Nd:YAG
laser with a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm, the repetition rate
of 10 Hz, and pulse duration of 10 ns with Gaussian beam distribution,
pulse energy of 350 mJ/pulse (178.3 J/cm2), with the irradiation
time of 10 min were used for laser synthesis experiments. The turquoise
target used in our experiment was obtained from the Nishapur (Iran).
This target is composed of two phases of different colors on the surface,
and the light brown veins were surrounded by the turquoise phase surface.
The laser was made to irradiate from the top of the cylindrical container
to the target at the bottom of the container to avoid reflections
through the glass walls. Pure ethanol (Merck, 99%) filling up to 0.01
m height on the top of the target surface was used as a liquid environment
for laser ablation experiments. The laser ablation experiments were
performed in two steps. In the first step, the laser beam was directed
on the vein of the turquoise surface and the related suspension was
collected and dripped to Si wafer followed by drying for morphological
and structural characterization. In the second step, the laser beam
was conducted on the turquoise surface, and as performed in the first
stage, the relevant solution was collected and dripped to the Si wafer
followed by drying for morphological and structural characterization.

Instrumentation
UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy
was carried out on the separated supernatant of the ablation product,
with a T80+ model spectrometer manufactured by PG Instruments Ltd.
(United Kingdom), PL emission was recorded using PL spectroscopy (Gilden
Photonics, Scotland), and XRD patterns were obtained using a Phillips
X’pert MPD powder diffractometer with radiation of Co Kα
(wavelength = 0.179 nm, Netherland). The morphology of the nanostructures
was characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM, MIRA3TESCAN-XMU, Czech Republic). HRTEM images and SAED patterns
were taken using FEI Titan 80–300 LB (200 kV, America).
