To investigate the potential role of immunotherapies
in the cellular
and molecular mechanisms associated with ovarian cancer (OC), we applied
a comparative proteomic toll using protein identification combined
with mass spectrometry. Herein, the effects of the protein aggregate
magnesium-ammonium phospholinoleate-palmitoleate anhydride, known
as P-MAPA, and the human recombinant interleukin-12 (hrIL-12) were
tested alone or in combination in human SKOV-3 cells. The doses and
period were defined based on a previous study, which showed that 25
μg/mL P-MAPA and 1 ng/mL IL-12 are sufficient to reduce cell
metabolism after 48 h. Indeed, among 2,881 proteins modulated by the
treatments, 532 of them were strictly concordant and common. P-MAPA
therapy upregulated proteins involved in tight junction, focal adhesion,
ribosome constitution, GTP hydrolysis, semaphorin interactions, and
expression of SLIT and ROBO, whereas it downregulated ERBB4 signaling,
toll-like receptor signaling, regulation of NOTCH 4, and the ubiquitin
proteasome pathway. In addition, IL-12 therapy led to upregulation
of leukocyte migration, tight junction, and cell signaling, while
cell communication, cell metabolism, and Wnt signaling were significantly
downregulated in OC cells. A clear majority of proteins that were
overexpressed by the combination of P-MAPA with IL-12 are involved
in tight junction, focal adhesion, DNA methylation, metabolism of
RNA, and ribosomal function; only a small number of downregulated
proteins were involved in cell signaling, energy and mitochondrial
processes, cell oxidation and senescence, and Wnt signaling. These
findings suggest that P-MAPA and IL-12 efficiently regulated important
proteins associated with OC progression; these altered proteins may
represent potential targets for OC treatment in addition to its immunoadjuvant
effects.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Ovarian cancer (OC) represents
the most lethal of gynecological
malignancies being often diagnosed at a late stage.1,2 The
majority of patients experience difficulties over the course of treatment,
with a 5 years survival rate of 35% when diagnosed late.3 Because no evident symptom is present at an early-stage
OC, the disease can rapidly progress to an incurable form.4−11 Importantly, patients are generally responsive to the treatments;
however, through several mechanisms, they develop resistance to chemotherapy
and OC grows wildly.12 New promising strategies
to overcome chemoresistance and increase chemosensitivity have been
developed for OC treatment, including immunotherapies.

We evaluated
the effect of two immunotherapeutic agents from the
proteomic standpoint. The immunomodulatory agent termed protein aggregate
magnesium-ammonium phospholinoleate-palmitoleate anhydride (P-MAPA)
is a natural biopolymer extracted from the Aspergillus
oryzae. Experimentally, P-MAPA exhibits a number of
antitumor responses in different in vivo models of cancer,11,13,14 and specifically in OC, P-MAPA
potentiated the effects of cisplatin, thereby enhancing TLR signaling
in immune cells and attenuating tumor growth.11 Another tested agent was interleukin-12 (IL-12), a cytokine secreted
by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which is involved in the differentiation
of naïve T cells into a polarized Th1 immune response.15,16 Treatment with IL-12 promotes tumor regression and reduces the potential
of tumor outgrowth in patients with recurrent OC;16,17 although IL-12 therapy results in an OC refractory state, the major
challenge is related to its high cellular toxicity.18 Although these immunotherapies have demonstrated to be
quite effective in the treatment of OC with regard to the tumor microenvironment,
their exact role on OC cells in terms of protein synthesis and secretion
is far from being understood; certainly, there must be other particular
functions in addition to those related to the immune system.

Identifying successfully signaling pathways that coordinate tumor
cell metabolism, protein–protein interactions, secretion of
molecules and factors, and activity of specific enzymes is needed
to discover new chemical agents and further modify the OC aggressiveness.
Thus, proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry (MS) may provide
a wide body of information considering proper candidates for OC development
and treatment.10,19−21 Large or small
molecules are definitely recognized to be involved in intra- or intercellular
processes, in which one molecule can possibly be sharing different
signaling mechanisms in the same tumor cell.

Although there
are important studies reporting the use of mass
spectrometry in the diagnosis of cancers, including the monitoring
strategies for OC,10,22,23 none has shown the concurrent role of immunotherapies in predicting
clinical outcomes from the “omics” standpoint. To further
strengthen this issue, we studied the effects of immunotherapeutic
agents, P-MAPA and IL-12, directly on human ovarian cancer SKOV-3
cells through proteomic profiling.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Influence of Low-Dose Administration of P-MAPA
and IL-12 in SKOV-3 Cells’ Viability
The global behavior
of OC cells in response to different conditions of treatment is crucial
for designing future strategies. We previously reported an immunostimulatory
effect of P-MAPA in an in vivo OC model,11 while IL-12 is a well-known inductor of polarized Th1 immune response.15,16 Despite the consistent effects on the tumor microenvironment, the
direct effect of these compounds in cancer cells is uncertain, and
understanding how they act in OC in a safe dose regimen may be greatly
beneficial for patients. Although several proteomic approaches in
animal models with OC have recently been tested, little is known about
the effects of P-MAPA and IL-12 on this disease. The effects of P-MAPA
and IL-12 were first tested using three different doses and four exposure
times (Figure 1A).
After an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay, cell viability was reduced by P-MAPA at a dose of 25
μg/mL (∼ 25% reduction), by IL-12 at a dose of 1 ng/mL
(∼ 25% reduction), and by the association of P-MAPA with IL-12
(∼ 30% reduction) after 48 h (Figure 1B) (see details in Experimental Section, Section 4.3). We then performed a global proteomic
analysis in OC cells treated with P-MAPA, IL-12, and P-MAPA associated
with IL-12, reporting an extensive catalogue of differentially expressed
proteins that are affected by these immunotherapies. The majority
of proteins described herein are involved in key cellular processes
and signaling pathways, such as metabolic processes; catalytic functions;
structural activity; protein, DNA, and RNA binding; and transcription/translation
regulatory activity. The variety of biological functions impacted
by these agents makes them interesting candidates as potential alternatives
to OC treatment.

100 μg/mL) in four different periods (0, 24, 48, and 72 h).
(B) Cell viability (%) after exposure to three different doses of
IL-12 (0.5, 1, and 2 ng/mL) in four different periods (0, 24, 48,
and 72 h). Colored line of the selected dose is highlighted. (C) Cell
viability (%) was assessed by MTT (1 × 103 cells)
after exposure to standardized doses of treatments (25 μg/mL
P-MAPA, 1 ng/mL IL-12, or both) at 48 h. The results are expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). *p <
0.05 vs control.

2.2 Label-Free Proteomic Analysis of SKOV-3 Cells
Treated with P-MAPA and IL-12
Samples were fractionated with
reverse-phase columns to separate protein mixtures, and label-free
analysis was performed on peptides by their charges and hydrophobicity.
This analysis identified a total of 896 proteins among control, P-MAPA,
IL-12, and P-MAPA + IL-12 groups. We reported a total of 636 molecules
in the control, 719 in the P-MAPA group, 709 in the IL-12 group, and
740 proteins in the P-MAPA + IL-12 group, while 532 were commonly
found in all tested groups (Figure 2). General intersections showing the proteins that
are present in one or more groups were represented and varied with
the treatment. Figure 3 shows the interaction between up- and downregulated proteins with
the highest confidence (0.900) after P-MAPA therapy compared with
the control. We found a total of 770 proteins in these groups, while
585 were coexpressed. In the P-MAPA group, there were 50 downregulated
and 21 upregulated proteins (Table 1) compared with the control, considering the differential
expression by at least ±1.5-fold change. The great majority of
upregulated molecules are proteins related to protein localization
to the membrane, epithelial cell differentiation, SRP-dependent cotranslational
protein targeting the membrane, and translational initiation. Otherwise,
the downregulated proteins are involved in protein peptidyl-prolyl
isomerization, intracellular transport, error-free and -prone translesion
synthesis, and the TRIF-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway.

Figure 4 shows the
up- and downregulated protein networks with clusters of strong confidence
(highest confidence: 0.900) between the proteins produced by the SKOV-3
cells after IL-12 treatment versus the control group. A total of 762
proteins were identified, and 583 of them were coexpressed in the
two groups. Based on differential expression by at least a factor
of ±1.5 in the IL-12 group relative to the corresponding control
group, we reported 85 downregulated proteins (Table 2), which are involved in different biological
processes and molecular function: cytoskeleton organization, cellular
component organization or biogenesis, structural molecule activity,
protein-containing complex binding, and actin filament binding. Conversely,
from the 30 upregulated proteins, we found some of them involved in
a number of cellular events, such as intracellular transport, chromosome
and organelle organization, chromatin silencing, structural molecule
activity, and protein heterodimerization.

The combinatory treatment of P-MAPA and IL-12 versus
the control
group showed the up- and downregulated protein network with a very
strong confidence relationship (0.900) (Figure 5). We found a total of 817 proteins, with
559 of them being differentially expressed by at least a factor of
±1.5 in the P-MAPA + IL-12 group relative to the corresponding
untreated group. Among the 31 upregulated proteins, most of them were
involved in different biological processes and molecular functions
including canonical glycolysis, doxorubicin and daunorubicin metabolic
processes, trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase activity,
ketosteroid monooxygenase activity, androsterone dehydrogenase activity,
phenanthrene 9,10-monooxygenase activity, and aldo-keto reductase
(NADP) activity (Table 3). We found 76 downregulated proteins, with proteins involved in
translational initiation, SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting
the membrane, nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated
decay, mRNA catabolic process, cellular component biogenesis, nucleosomal
DNA binding, structural molecule activity, protein-containing complex
binding, cytoskeletal protein binding, and structural constituent
of ribosome.

2.3 P-MAPA and IL-12 Differentially Alter Cellular
Function-Related Proteins in SKOV-3 Cells
To provide another
view of which categories the differentially expressed proteins belong
to, gene ontology (GO) annotation was carried out. We used PANTHER
classification to demonstrate the molecular function, cellular component,
biological processes, and protein class whereby specific treatment
was able to alter. The result was a large and complex molecule network
for each treatment. The main protein functions that differentially
varied after treatments with P-MAPA, IL-12, and P-MAPA + IL-12 are
summarized in Figures 6–8, respectively.
The proteins differentially regulated by P-MAPA, IL-12, and P-MAPA
+ IL-12 treatments were the most closely related to molecular functions
such as binding, catalytic activity, and structural molecule activity.
With regard to biological processes, the majority of these proteins
were involved in a metabolic process, biological regulation, and cellular
component organization or biogenesis, being represented mostly by
chaperones, cytoskeletal proteins, enzyme modulators, and hydrolases.
Importantly, modulation of key processes that allow cancer cells to
have a metabolic advantage and increased capacity to regulate cell
binding with other tissues might be an important feature of all treatments.

We observed increased expressions of hybrid ubiquitin-ribosomal
protein L40 (RPL40) and ubiquitin-ribosomal protein s27a (RPS27a)
after the treatment with P-MAPA (2.9-fold increase), IL-12 (1.94-fold
increase), and P-MAPA + IL-12 (2.6-fold increase). It has long been
documented that ubiquitin targets proteins for proteasome degradation
or nondegradation signaling.24 Anticancer
drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil, trichostatin A, and paclitaxel, often
lead to overexpression of ubiquitin, which causes increased susceptibility
to apoptotic cell death in a number of tumor cell lines.25 In this process, the aggregation of ubiquitylated
proteins in the nucleus is an important event, and this transport
can be facilitated by ubiquitin binding to either RPS27a or RPL40.25 In colorectal cancer cells, upregulation of
the UBA52 gene, which encodes the ubiquitin-RPL40
hybrid protein, is related to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis induction
via activation of the RPL40-MDM2-p53 pathway, resulting in increased
expression of the tumor-suppressor p53.26 Additionally, all treatments were able to upregulate polyubiquitin-B
and -C, in which the chains are highly related with caspase-8 activation
mediated by tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)
and, consequently, sensibilization of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis.27 Since
chemoresistance and tumor aggressiveness are common challenges in
the treatment of OC, the combined use of traditional chemotherapeutics
and adjuvant components capable of modulating ubiquitination and promoting
cell death might improve the therapy efficacy.

Among proteins
that were downregulated by P-MAPA, IL-12, and P-MAPA
+ IL-12 treatments were myosin-9 (1.9-, 2.03-, and 2.5-fold decrease
vs the control group, respectively), T-complex protein 1 (2.08-, 2.24-,
and 3.08-fold decrease), and prohibitin-2 (2.24-, 2.07-, and 2.34-fold
decrease). Myosin-9 is a heavy chain of myosin IIA and is involved
in cytokinesis, maintenance of cell shape, and cell motility.28 It has been suggested as a possible target for
anti-invasive treatment in the breast cancer cell line MCF-729 and in gastric cancer.30 Its overexpression has been related to both decreased overall survival
and disease-free survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)30 and also in lung adenocarcinoma.31 T-complex 1 protein is involved in a number
of biological processes, particularly in cytoskeletal organization
and cell-cycle progression,32 and many
studies found these proteins to be strictly related to tumor progression.33,34 Particularly, in ESCC, a T-complex protein 1 subunit expression
increased cell migration and invasion via regulation of α-actin
and β-tubulin, and its silencing has been suggested as a possible
treatment alternative.35 Notably, prohibitins
have been shown to be involved in cancer cell growth and survival,
resistance to chemotherapy, immune response, and metastasis through
a number of mechanisms, including p53-related transcriptional regulation,
TGF-β signaling pathway modulation, and Ras/ERK pathway activation.36,37 In ovarian epithelial tumors, prohibitin-2 is thought to induce
cancer cell growth and increase the susceptibility of malignant transformation,38 while prohibitin-1 promotes survival of cancer
cells, acting as an antiapoptotic factor.39 Furthermore, cytoplasmic expression of prohibitin-2 is involved
in hormone-related growth of breast cancer cells because it upregulates
the estrogen-signaling pathway.40 Prohibitin-1
and prohibitin-2 are overexpressed in colorectal cancer, and serum
concentration of these proteins, also elevated in colorectal cancer
patients, was suggested as a potential biomarker for this disease.41 Prohibitin-2 clustering with glucose-related
protein 75 (GPR75)/mortalin is related to increased cell proliferation
and tumorigenesis in metastatic cells.42 To determine whether P-MAPA and IL-12 are capable of slowing
down the tumor cell motility (as they were already proved to reduce
migratory/proliferation capacity of cells), novel approaches based
on timing and tumor features (subtype, grading, and staging) should
be taken into consideration during OC treatment.

Among proteins
that were simultaneously and significantly altered
after treatments with IL-12 or the association P-MAPA + IL-12, we
observed upregulation of cofilin-2 (2.41- and 2.46-fold increase vs
the control group, respectively). Cofilin-2, which is known as the
actin depolymerization factor, is a member of the cofilins family,
being crucial modulators of actin dynamics.43 The role of human cofilin-2 (protein and gene) is controversial
in cancer. Important data suggest that cofilin-2 is downregulated
in pancreatic tumor tissues44 and that
the ability of actin depolymerization by cofilin is associated with
mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis induction
in cancer cells.45 Additionally, cofilin-2
translocation to mitochondria and interaction with Drp1 constitute
key events for mitochondrial fission and apoptosis induced by erucin
in breast cancer cells.46 On the other
hand, studies have suggested that cofilin-2 expression may play a
role in malignant progression, modulating cancer cell proliferation,
invasion, and metastasis.47−49 Since we previously reported
a reduction in cell viability after exposure to all treatments, we
believe that increased cofilin-2 levels might hamper the ovarian tumor
growth by disrupting the cell metabolism, thus inducing cell death
and diminishing metabolic activity.

The most positive effects
of treatments with IL-12 and P-MAPA +
IL-12 seem to be associated with downregulated proteins: 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase (6PGD) (2.51- and 2.35-fold decrease vs the control
group, respectively), Hsc70-interacting protein (2.44- and 2.38-fold
decrease), plectin (2.04- and 2.61-fold decrease), and myosin light
chains (2.66- and 2.34-fold decrease). 6PGD is an enzyme of the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway, which is involved in anabolic biosynthesis,
glycolysis, and redox homeostasis in cancer cells, thus providing
metabolic advantages to cellular survival and proliferation.50,51 The activity of this enzyme is upregulated in a number of cancers
and has been implicated in chemoresistance of ovarian and other tumors.52 Inhibition of 6PGD selectively targeted breast
cancer cells, sparing normal breast cells53 and increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy in cervical cancer through
AMPK-independent inhibition of RhoA and Rac1 activities.54 In addition, suppression of 6PGD sensitized
cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment via
the AMPK-dependent pathway, thus restoring its therapeutic efficacy.52 In the highly aggressive anaplastic thyroid
carcinoma, 6PGD inhibition is associated with resensitization to doxorubicin
treatment by decreasing levels of NADPH, NADH, and enzymatic activity
of sirtuin-1.55 Briefly, the disruption
of cancer cell metabolism provided by downregulation of 6PGD might
be a highly positive effect of treatment with IL-12 and association
of P-MAPA and IL-12, including chemosensitivity restoration.

Modulating the tumor ability for signaling and interacting with
normal cells is an important aim of alternative therapy. In this context,
treatment of OC cells with IL-12 and P-MAPA + IL-12 significantly
reduced the levels of the carboxyl terminus Hsc70-interacting protein
(CHIP). Notably, CHIP seems to have dual functions in cancer, with
some studies reporting its role as a tumor suppressor and others as
an oncogene.56 Decreased CHIP expression
in ER-positive breast cancer and pancreatic cancer tissues is related
with poor prognostic and short survival of patients.56,57 Additionally, CHIP levels are inversely correlated with tumor malignancy
in gastric cancer.58 Conversely, CHIP promotes
the downregulation of Profilin-1 in breast cancer cells, thus possibly
playing a role in cell migration and metastasis.59 A number of studies have been implicating CHIP in the modulation
of the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), tumor-suppressor p53, and
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1).60−62 In esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, high CHIP expression is correlated with increased
number of metastatic lymph nodes.63 Xu
and colleagues64 reported CHIP activation
of MAPK and AKT signaling activities and upregulation of E-cadherin,
which led to epithelial–mesenchymal transition and enhanced
migration and invasion potential of cells.

Cellular dynamics
is a fundamental characteristic for cellular
proliferation and, consequently, for tumor growth. Decreased levels
of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) and plectin after IL-12 and
the combination of P-MAPA and IL-12 may be able to impair cancer cell
dynamics, directly by avoiding cell proliferation and reducing their
aggressiveness. The MLC phosphorylation seems to be an important marker
for cancer cell functions, including cell growth, adhesion, and migration.65,66 Leiomyosarcomas with high proliferative activity present increased
MLC phosphorylation,67,68 which is majorly measured by
MLC kinase (MLCK) expression. In fact, the blockage of MLCK activities
by a pharmacological inhibitor decreases breast cancer cell growth.69,70 The expression of phosphomimetic MLC is able to increase the proliferative
rate calculated by Ki-67 expression.69 Another
important protein to control cellular dynamics is plectin, playing
key roles in cytoskeleton anchoring, signal transduction, and even
in apoptosis induction.71−73 Katada and colleagues74 observed that plectin expression is significantly
higher in tumor tissues compared with nontumor tissues in head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Overexpression of this protein
has also been reported in colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and
prostatic cancer.75−77 Additionally, its upregulation is directly associated
with poor prognosis and increased frequency of recurrence. Plectin
also activates ERK 1/2 kinases to promote migration and invasion of
HNSCC cells.74 The depletion of plectin
is able to impair cellular proliferation and migration in the MCF-7
breast cancer cell line78 and in PC3 prostate
cancer cells.79

Finally, treatment
with P-MAPA and the association of P-MAPA and
IL-12 significantly reduced the levels of the key protein vimentin
(1.64- and 2.52-fold decrease vs the control group, respectively).
Vimentin is an intermediate filament found in various mesenchymal
cells in a wide variety of tissues, responsible for the maintenance
of cell and tissue integrity.80 In platinum-resistant
ovarian cancer cell lineages, the reduction of vimentin levels by
miRNA let-7g overexpression resulted in reduced epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), decreased their migratory potential, and restored
sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy.81 High expression of vimentin has also been implicated in poor prognosis
in a number of other cancer types, such as breast cancer, prostate
cancer, colorectal cancer, and nonsmall-cell lung cancer.82−85 Its upregulation is further associated with decreased disease-free
survival and increased lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer.85 Vimentin is a key factor for epithelial plasticity
and cytoplasm architecture maintenance during the epithelial–mesenchymal
transition, and its overexpression confers elevated cancer cell motility,
directional migration, and metastasis.82,86,87 In the MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line, the depletion
of vimentin promoted reorganization of the cytoskeleton and decreased
cell proliferation and motility.87 We believe
that the association of P-MAPA with IL-12 is important to disassemble
part of the cytoskeleton that regulates tumor cell aggressiveness.

In summary, our present findings reveal important mechanisms by
which immunotherapy with P-MAPA and IL-12 may impact OC progression
and aggressiveness. The wide variety of targets exhibited herein shows
that these treatments are able to attack OC cell malignant functions
through different regulatory mechanisms. Future studies associating
these therapies with OC standard chemotherapy (e.g., taxanes and platinum
derivatives) could also bring an important approach regarding the
use of these compounds as adjuvant therapeutics.

3 Conclusions
We described a number of
important changes in several protein signatures
that are modulated by P-MAPA and IL-12 therapies in ovarian cancer
SKOV-3 cells. While P-MAPA and IL-12 alone were efficient to upregulate
structural proteins (e.g., related to tight junctions), they downregulated
molecules involved in cell signaling that are associated with cancer
progression. Combinatory therapy with P-MAPA and IL-12 was the most
efficient to distinctively regulate proteins involved in metabolic
processes, such as energy and mitochondrial processes, cell oxidation,
and senescence; inhibition of these activities may render cancer cells
more vulnerable to structural instability, apoptosis, and metabolical
dysfunctions. This approach provides reliable insights into the cellular
regulation associated with OC progression and, alternatively, suggests
the therapeutic use of P-MAPA and IL-12 as a complementary strategy
for OC treatment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Cell Line and Culture
Human OC cell
line, SKOV-3, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Rockville, MD). During the experiment, SKOV-3 cells were incubated
with RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% anti-anti solution (100 mg/mL penicillin
G, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)).
Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2, and the culture medium was changed every 2–3
days.

4.2 P-MAPA and IL-12 Treatments
To determine
the better dose–response effect, three different doses of P-MAPA
(25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) were used in accordance with Fávaro.13 Initially, 5 mg of P-MAPA was diluted in 1 mL
of saline to achieve a stock solution of 5 mg/mL; this solution was
then diluted in the cell culture medium to obtain the proper concentrations.
For the treatment with recombinant (rh)IL-12, doses of 0.5, 1, and
2 ng/mL were used in the culture medium in accordance the method of
Su and colleagues.88 To combine P-MAPA
with IL-12, the most representative dose and incubation time were
chosen after performing the MTT assay. The saline solution was used
as a solvent vehicle control and administered in the same procedures
for treatments.

4.3 MTT Assay
SKOV-3 cells were seeded
in a plate at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well. Cellular
activity or toxicity was first evaluated using the three concentrations
of both treatments, P-MAPA and IL-12, after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure.
All analyses were performed in three technical and biological replicates.
MTT solution was added to the wells for 4 h, and the crystals were
diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) under agitation. The concentration
was determined by an Epoch microplate reader (BioTek Instruments,
Highland Park, PO) at 540 nm, with the reference curve fixed at 650
nm. The percentage (%) of crystal formation was calculated based on
the control group as the reference. After the testing assay, we determined
the doses of 25 μg/mL P-MAPA and 1 ng/mL IL-12 and set the period
of treatment at 48 h. Since the study proposed to globally identify
proteins involved in potential signaling pathways that are modulated
by the treatments, we defined doses and periods capable of decreasing
10–30% cell viability; higher doses could bias the results
because the increased cell death might result in loss of important
proteins.

4.4 Protein Quantification
After treatments,
the proteins were extracted from SKOV-3 cells in biological triplicate
from each experiment and were quantified in triplicate using a colorimetric
method described by Bradford (BioRad Protein Assay Kit; Cod. 500-0001).
Bovine serum albumin (0.1% BSA) was used as the reference protein.
After quantification, individual samples were transferred to Eppendorf
LoBind tubes and diluted with 0.9% (m/v) saline solution until reaching
the concentration of 50 μg/40 μL for each sample.

4.5 In-Solution Trypsin Digestion
All
samples were subjected to the protocol for trypsin digestion. First,
50 μg of lyophilized proteins was diluted in 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate, and 25 μL of RapiGest SF surfactant (code 186001861,
Waters Corporation) was added to the samples for 60 min at 37 °C.
Then, samples were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT) and 45 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature (RT) for 20
min. Enzymatic digestion was performed using trypsin (1:100; enzyme/sample)
solubilized in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.8) for 18 h.
Hydrolysis was stopped by adding 1% (v/v) formic acid to the samples
for 1 h. Samples were incubated for 90 min at RT and then centrifuged
at 14 000g for 30 min at 6 °C. Supernatants
were removed into a new tube and subjected to desalting columns Peptide
Cleanup C18 Spin (code 5188-2750 Agilent Technologies). After peptides
were dried in vacuum (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific), they were dissolved
in 3% acetonitrile (ACN) with 0.1% formic acid solution before analysis.

4.6 Peptide Sequencing for Mass Spectrometry
Label-free analysis was performed using a liquid nanocromatograph
(Ultimate 3000 LC Dionex, Germering, Germany) coupled to a quadrupole-orbitrap
model mass spectrometer Q-Exactive (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen,
Germany). The chromatograph was equipped with a binary system of pumps
and an automatic sample applicator. The mobile phase consisted of
0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water LCMS (solvent A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic
acid in 80% (v/v) ACN (solvent B). The peptides were loaded in a precolumn
C18, 30 μm × 5 mm (code 164649, ThermoFisher Scientific),
and desalting was carried out in an isocratic gradient of 4% B for
3 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Then, peptides were fractioned
using the analytical column Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ, 3 μm, 120 Å,
105 mm (code 1PCH7515-105H354-NV, PICOCHIP) using a linear gradient
of 4–55% B for 30 min, 55–90% B for 1 min, maintained
at 90% B for 5 min, and recalibrated at 4% B for 20 min (flow rate
of 300 nL/min). Positive ionization was obtained in a Nanospray ion
source (PICOCHIP) with the DDA method. Mass spectra were acquired
in the mass range of m/z 200–2000,
resolution of 70.000, and 100 ms for injection time. The fragmentation
chamber was conditioned with collision energy between 29 and 35%,
with resolution of 17.500, 50 ms of injection time, 4.0 m/z of MS/MS isolation window, and dynamic exclusion
of 10 s. All samples were quantified in biological and technical triplicate.
Spectrometry data were acquired using Thermo Xcalibur software (version
4.0.27.19, ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.).

4.7 Data Analysis
For proteomic analyses,
the raw data.RAW was subjected to software PatternLab (version 4.0.0.84;
Carvalho and colleagues)89 to identify
and determine which proteins were differentially expressed. The parameters
used were the Swiss-Prot database (Homo sapiens taxonomy), trypsin as the proteolytic enzyme, permission of two
lost cleavages, fixed modifications of cysteine carbamidomethylation
and methionine oxidation as variable modification, and tolerance errors
of MS 40 ppm and MS/MS 0.0200 ppm. The false discovery rate (FDR)
was set at ≤1%. We used only proteins obtained in all three
runs, and the spectral counts for each protein were normalized by
the weighted average of replicates of each sample. Missing data were
analyzed by multiple imputation according to Royston,90 and the standard errors were computed according to the
“Rubin rules”.91 Only proteins
that showed statistical significance at p < 0.05
and a protein ratio less than 1.5-fold change or greater than 1.5-fold
change were used. Results were compared using Student’s t test to set the differences between the groups (p < 0.05). Additional analyses of cellular components,
molecular function, and biological processes were determined through
Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary Relationship (PANTHER) (http://pantherdb.org/) classification,
and network interactions between proteins were obtained using STRING
software (http://string-db.org/) under the basic parameters of cutoff score of 0.900 (highest confidence),
evidence as network edges, and PPI enrichment p-value
of <1.0 × 10–16.
