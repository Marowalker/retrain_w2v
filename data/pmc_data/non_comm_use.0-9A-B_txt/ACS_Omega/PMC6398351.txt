Dendrimers
are interesting candidates for various applications because of the
high level of control over their architecture, the presence of internal
cavities, and the possibility for multivalent interactions. More specifically,
zwitterionic dendrimers modified with an equal number of oppositely
charged groups have found use in in vivo biomedical applications.
However, the design and control over the synthesis of these dendrimers
remains challenging, in particular with respect to achieving full
modification of the dendrimer. In this work, we show the design and
subsequent synthesis of dendrimers that are highly charged while having
zero net charge, that is zwitterionic dendrimers that are potential
candidates for biomedical applications. First, we designed and fully
optimized the synthesis of charge-neutral carboxybetaine and sulfobetaine
zwitterionic dendrimers. Following their synthesis, the various zwitterionic
dendrimers were extensively characterized. In this study, we
also report for the first time the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
as an easy-to-use and quantitative tool for the compositional analysis
of this type of macromolecules that can complement techniques such
as nuclear magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatography. Finally,
we designed and synthesized zwitterionic dendrimers that contain a
variable number of alkyne and azide groups that allow straightforward
(bio)functionalization via click chemistry.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Dendrimers
are multivalent (macro)molecules in which the repeat units are not
connected in a linear fashion, but form a well-defined, branched three-dimensional
architecture of nanometer size.1−4 As a result, they possess a distinct molecular architecture
that consists of a central core, branches, and terminal functional
groups present at the outer surface of the macromolecule. Because
of their unique, highly defined 3D structure, dendrimers have found
use in a wide variety of applications ranging from dyes5 to catalysts,6 and
from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents7 to sensors for small molecules.8 Furthermore, the high level of control over dendritic architectures,
the presence of internal cavities and the possibility for multivalent
binding have made dendrimers ideal candidates for carriers in biomedical
applications.3,4,9 Therefore,
over the past years, the use of dendrimers for gene and drug delivery
has been extensively reported.9−12 However, most commonly used dendrimers, which include
PPI (poly(propylene imine)) and PAMAM (poly(amido amine)),13 by themselves are not biocompatible and can
induce cytotoxic effects.10,14 As a result, for in
vivo use the exterior of dendrimers needs to be modified with, for
instance, polyethylene glycol15−17 or charged groups18−23 to reduce their toxicity.

While such dendrimers modified with
charged groups have found use in biomedical applications such as drug
delivery, sensing, and MRI contrast agents,21−30 the design and control over the synthesis of these dendrimers remains
challenging and is still subject to further optimization. So far,
only partially zwitterionic dendrimers (ZIDs) (modification of either
only the interior or of the exterior of the dendrimer), or dendrimers
with nonpermanent, pH-sensitive charged groups (i.e. protonated amines)
have been reported.21−30

Given these limitations, it is therefore still highly relevant
to design and characterize dendrimers that are highly charged, yet
could intrinsically have a zero net charge, that is ZID. We expect
that the complete charge neutrality of such ZIDs can further diminish
undesired interactions within a living system, thus making them more
suitable for in vitro and in vivo applications, just like their larger,
but less well-defined polymer counterparts, zwitterionic polymers.21,31,32 Building blocks for such a new
type of zwitterionic materials should allow for a high density of
oppositely charged moieties, creating a strong zwitterionic character,
while remaining overall neutral. In addition, their inherently multivalent
nature should, in principle, allow that ZIDs are functionalized in
a controlled manner with multiple functional groups, including for
example biorecognition elements. Within this project, specifically
PPI dendrimers were found to be interesting candidates because of
their high density of quaternizable amine groups and commercial availability.1,13 Furthermore, they have been found to more stable than PAMAM dendrimers,
which can undergo retro-Michael reactions (β-eliminations) at
high temperature or pH, which may be detrimental during the synthesis
of the ZID.33,34

Here, we report the first
synthesis of a series of ZIDs as well as their characterization. We
prepare second and third generation ZIDs with a near-equal number
of positively charged (quaternary) nitrogen atoms and negatively charged
carboxylates, so as to make an electrically neutral oligocarboxybetaine.
Of course, such carboxylate moieties could be functionalized—for
example via standard NHS/EDC chemistry—but only with concomitant
loss of charge neutrality, which for such relatively small molecules
would easily increase the interaction with biomolecules. To thus allow
for a precisely controlled functionalization of intrinsically charge-neutral
ZIDs, we subsequently developed a synthetic strategy that allows incorporation
of a specific number of clickable azido or alkyne functional groups.
In this work, we also present for the first time the use of X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for the quantitative compositional
analysis of such three-dimensional oligomers and show the power of
this technique for the analysis of the chemical composition of large
organic molecules. Because of their highly branched nature, dendrimeric
building blocks have a large number of functional groups that all
need to be converted during the synthesis. However, from an analytical
perspective, it is often far from trivial to accurately determine
this degree of conversion. To complement limitations with conventionally
used analytical methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
mass spectrometry (MS), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and infrared
(IR), we thus invoked XPS. This technique, traditionally used for
surface analysis, allowed us to precisely determine the nature and
electronic environment of specific elements in the relevant functional
group (nitrogen atoms in our case), from which we could accurately
determine the overall conversion.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
Milli-Q water was purified
by a Barnsted water purification system, with a resistivity of <18.3

3 Methods
3.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
1H NMR measurements were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE
III NMR at 400 MHz, 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100
MHz. For the 1H–15N HMBC (heteronuclear
multiple bond correlation) measurements settings of 600 and 60 MHz
were used, respectively, on a 600 MHz Bruker AVANCE III Ultrashield
Plus equipped with a cryoprobe. Chemical shifts are reported in parts
per million (ppm) and are referred to the methyl signal of the sodium
salt of 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid-d6 (δ = 0).

3.2 Infrared
IR analyses
were performed on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with platinum attenuated
total reflection accessory.

3.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Samples for dendrimer analysis were prepared by concentrating the
dendrimers (in Milli-Q water) and dropcasting 3 μL of this suspension
onto a piece of Si(111) (Siltronix, N-type, phosphorus doped), which
was cleaned by rinsing and sonicating for 5 min in semiconductor grade
acetone followed by oxygen plasma treatment (Diener electronic, Femto
A) for 1 min at 100% power. The dropcast samples were subsequently
dried in vacuum overnight before XPS measurements were started. XPS
spectra were obtained using a JPS-9200 photoelectron spectrometer
(JEOL, Japan) with monochromatic Al Kα X-ray radiation at 12
kV and 20 mA. The obtained spectra were analyzed using CASA XPS software
(version 2.3.16 PR 1.6). In C 1s and N 1s narrow-range spectra, the
positions are set to 285 and 400 eV for the C–C and N–C
signals, respectively.

3.4 Gel Permeation Chromatography
The polymer molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) were
determined using GPC (Agilent G5654A quaternary pump, G7162A refractive
index detector), where a PSS SUPREMA Combination medium (P/N 206–0002)
1000 Å single porosity column was employed (0.05% NaN3 in Milli-Q water as eluent, 1 mL/min). Dendrimer in Milli-Q solutions
were freshly prepared. Twenty microliters was used for each analysis.
An Agilent PL2080-0101 PEO calibration kit was used for calibration
purposes.

3.5 Mass Spectrometry
MS data were recorded
on an exactive high-resolution MS instrument (Thermo Scientific) equipped
with an electrospray ionization (ESI) probe. The MS was calibrated
daily using ProteoMass LTQ/FT-hybrid ESI Pos. Mode Cal Mix and Pierce
ESI Neg. Ion Cal. solutions. Thermo Xcalibur Browser software (version
4.0.27.19) was used for instrument control, data acquisition, and
data processing.

3.6 Synthesis of 2 PPI-Me
A solution of 0.500 g of 1 PPI G3 dendrimer
(0.296 mmol) in 10 mL Milli-Q water was prepared. A 100 mL 3-neck
round bottom flask with a cooler and a stirring bar was flushed with
argon by applying 3 vacuum–argon cycles, ending with a final
argon refill. Under argon overpressure, 20 mL Milli-Q water, 6.35
mL formaldehyde (37% aqueous solution; 75 mmol, 15 equiv per PPI primary
amine), and 6.12 mL formic acid (150 mmol, 30 equiv per PPI primary
amine) were added. The mixture was cooled on ice before the 1 PPI G3 in 10 mL Milli-Q water was added dropwise. The reaction
mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature, after which the
setup was closed under argon and refluxed using an oil bath for 5
continuous days to assure full conversion.

Afterwards, the mixture
was cooled on ice and the pH was increased to 11 by the slow addition
of a saturated NaOH solution. The solution became cloudy because the
methylated dendrimers were less water soluble after deprotonation
at this concentration. The aqueous solution was extracted with DCM
for three times. The combined organic layers were washed with water
and dried over Na2SO4. After evaporation of
the solvent, 0.474 g (0.22 mmol) of a yellow oil was obtained with
a yield of 80%.

For the synthesis of 2 PPI-Me G2
and G4, the amounts were adjusted in order to retain 15 equiv of formaldehyde
and 30 equiv formic acid per PPI primary amine.

3.7 Synthesis of 3 PPI-CB1
2 PPI-Me
(0.200 g; 0.094 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL aqueous NaOH solution
at pH 10 by stirring in a 10 mL round bottom flask. Sodium iodoacetate
(2.08 g; 10 mmol) was added and the solution was stirred at room temperature
in the dark for 3 days. Afterward, the pH was adjusted to ∼7
using an HCl solution to assure compatibility with the dialysis membrane
and the volume of the mixture was increased to 10 mL by addition of
Milli-Q water. The mixture was dialyzed against 500 mL Milli-Q water
for 3 days with three medium exchanges. After evaporation of the solvent
and lyophilization, 0.238 g of a fluffy white powder was obtained
with a yield of 68%.

For the synthesis of 3 PPI-CB1
G2 and G4 with sodium iodoacetate, the amounts were adjusted in order
to retain 4 equiv of sodium iodoacetate per 2 PPI-Me
tertiary amine.

3.8 Optimization Menschutkin
Alkylation of Methylated Dendrimers Using Different Alkyl Halides
To optimize the conversion of the alkylation reaction, we tested
different dendrimer sizes and alkylation agents and studied the results
by XPS N 1s high-resolution scans (see Figures S2 and S3). For the sodium salts sodium bromoacetate, sodium
bromoethane sulfonate, and sodium bromopropane sulfonate, a similar
procedure as described for sodium iodoacetate was used, keeping the
same equivalents: 0.200 g of 2 PPI (0.094 mmol) was dissolved
in 3 mL aqueous NaOH solution at pH 10 by stirring in a 10 mL round
bottom flask. The alkyl halide sodium salt (10 mmol) was added and
the solution was stirred at room temperature in the dark for 3 days.
Afterward, the pH was adjusted to ∼7 using an aqueous HCl solution
to assure compatibility with the dialysis membrane and the volume
of the mixture was increased to 10 mL by addition of Milli-Q water.
The mixture was dialyzed against 500 mL Milli-Q water for 3 days with
three medium exchanges. After evaporation of the solvent and lyophilization,
the products were obtained with various yields and conversions (see Figure S3).

For the reaction with protected
acids or methyl iodide instead of free acetates (tert-butyl iodoacetate, tert-butyl bromoacetate, methyl
iodoacetate, methyl bromoacetate), an adjusted protocol was followed,
using the same equivalents. For solubility reasons, acetonitrile was
used as a solvent instead of aqueous NaOH solution. Afterward, the
solvent and other volatiles were evaporated in vacuo and a deprotection
step was performed before purification. To this end, tert-butyl-protected CB1 dendrimers were stirred in 50 mmol trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) in 15 mL acetonitrile (3.3 M) at room temperature for 3
days, followed by evaporation of solvent, TFA, and tert-butanol. After dissolving the product in Milli-Q water, the pH was
adjusted to ∼7 using a NaOH solution before purification by
dialysis. Deprotection of methyl-protected CB1 dendrimers was achieved
by refluxing in a pH 10 NaOH solution for 3 days, and the pH was adjusted
to ∼7 using an HCl solution before purification by dialysis.
The dendrimer solutions were dialyzed against 500 mL Milli-Q water
for 3 days with three medium exchanges. After evaporation of the solvent
and lyophilization, the products were obtained with various conversions
(see Table 1 and Figure S3).

3.9 Synthesis of Alkyne-Functionalized PPI Dendrimer 4a
1 PPI G3 (50 mg, 0.029 mmol) was dissolved
in 5 mL dry acetonitrile by stirring in an argon-flushed 25 mL round
bottom flask. Then, 9 μL (0.062 mmol, n = 2),
13 μL (0.093 mmol, n = 3), or 26 μL (0.186 mmol, n = 6) of triethylamine
was added and the solution was cooled on ice. A solution of 13.5 mg
(0.060 mmol, n = 2), 20.3 mg (0.090 mmol, n = 3), or 40.5 mg (0.180 mmol, n = 6) of alkyne-NHS in 5 mL dry acetonitrile was slowly
added to the 1 PPI G3 solution while stirring vigorously
to assure an even distribution of the functional click handles over
the dendrimers. The mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature
and stirring was continued overnight under argon. The solvent and
triethylamine were removed by rotavap and oil pump vacuum until a
viscous colorless oil was left. About 10% of the crude was purified
using dialysis as described before for MS analysis purposes. From
this fraction, an average yield of ∼90% could be calculated.
The rest of the crude product was used for the next reaction step
without further purification.

3.10 Synthesis
of Alkyne-Functionalized PPI-Me 5a
The functionalized
dendrimer 4a was methylated as described before for compound 2, using the same equivalents, conditions, and purification
by extraction (note: after extraction there were still some minor
impurities present in NMR, which were fully removed after extensive
dialysis in the next modification step). This led to methylated, functionalized
dendrimers with typical yields of ∼70%.

3.11 Synthesis of Alkyne-Functionalized PPI-CB1 6a
The methylated, functionalized dendrimers were alkylated using
sodium iodoacetate as described previously for compound 3. This yielded alkyne-modified ZID with typical yields of 30% (not
taking into account that the conversion in the last step is not quantitative).

3.12 Synthesis of Azide-Functionalized PPI Dendrimer 4b
1 PPI G3 (50 mg; 0.029 mmol) was
dissolved in 5 mL dry acetonitrile by stirring in an argon-flushed
25 mL round bottom flask. Then, 13 μL (0.093 mmol, n = 3) or 26 μL (0.186 mmol, n = 6) of triethylamine was added and the solution was cooled
on ice. A solution of 50.8 mg (0.090 mmol, n = 3) or 101.6 mg (0.180 mmol, n = 6) of azide-PEG-NHS
in 5 mL dry acetonitrile was slowly added to the 1 PPI
G3 solution while stirring vigorously to assure an even distribution
of the functional handles over the dendrimers. The mixture was allowed
to warm up to room temperature, and stirring was continued overnight
under argon. The solvent and triethylamine were removed by rotavap
and oil pump vacuum until a viscous colorless oil was left. The crude
product was used for the next reaction step without further purification.

3.13 Synthesis of Azide-Functionalized PPI-Me 5b
The functionalized dendrimer 4b was
methylated as described before for compound 2, using
the same equivalents, conditions, and purification by extraction (note:
after extraction there were still some minor impurities present in
NMR, which were fully removed after extensive dialysis in the next
modification step). This led to methylated, functionalized dendrimers
with an average yield of ∼89%.

3.14 Synthesis
of Azide-Functionalized PPI-CB1 6b
The methylated,
functionalized dendrimers were alkylated using sodium iodoacetate
as described previously for compound 3. This yielded
alkyne-modified ZID with an average yield of ∼68%.

3.15 Synthesis of Biotin-Functionalized PPI Dendrimer 7
A solution of 21.6 mg (0.0055 mmol) alkyne-functionalized
ZID 6a (n = 3) in 1.6 mL Milli-Q water
was prepared. Next, 0.2 mL of a 1 mg/mL solution (0.001 mmol) of
copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate in Milli-Q water was mixed with 0.2
mL of a 200 mg/mL solution (0.2 mmol) of sodium ascorbate in Milli-Q
water. This mixture was added to the dendrimer 6a solution
after which 10.8 mg (0.024 mmol) azide-PEG3-biotin was added. The
solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was
dialyzed (MWCO 1000–5000 Da) against 500 mL Milli-Q water for
3 days with three medium exchanges. After evaporation of the solvent
and lyophilization, 20.6 mg of a fluffy light yellow powder was obtained.

4 Results and Discussion
Previously, PAMAM22,23 or PPI dendrimers22 and polyethyleneimine
polymers35 have been modified to become
exteriorly zwitterionic by reacting only the outer primary amines
with zwitterionic monomers in order to reduce their cytotoxicity.
Alternatively, Hu et al. investigated the interior zwitterionic modification
of both PPI and PAMAM dendrimers for drug delivery purposes by first
acetylating the outer amines and subsequently reacting the inner tertiary
amines with 1,3-propane sultone in DMF.19 However, the conversion of their last step was only moderate (below
50%), probably because their solvent of choice was not compatible
with the formed highly zwitterionic product, leading to premature
precipitation before the fully zwitterionic product could be formed.
A drawback of partial zwitterionic modification is the relatively
low density of charges and—more importantly—the presence
of unreacted amines that can be protonated, leading to an overall
positively charged dendrimer.

To introduce zwitterionic character
to the PPI dendrimer, several synthetic routes can be followed. However,
not all will necessarily lead to an uncharged final product. For example,
Carr et al. have reported the synthesis of zwitterionic crosslinkers
for hydrogels by performing a Michael addition on a secondary amine-containing
monomer with a protected acid (which was deprotected in the end),
followed by N-alkylation using methyl iodide.20 While this approach could also be applied to PAMAM or PPI dendrimers,
it would lead to an overall charge of −2 (meaning two noncompensated
carboxylate negative charges), regardless of the size of the initial
dendrimer (see Supporting Information,
Figure S1). Apart from being a conceptual concession, this would likely
be detrimental for their performance in biological systems,36 as it could attract positively charged biomaterials.
As a result, we rather aim for the design of fully zwitterionic, charge-neutral
dendrimers, and for this it is crucial that the installation of the
negatively charged group occurs simultaneously with the creation of
the positivity charged group (in case of PPI dendrimers, this is the
ammonium group). This means that before introduction of the negatively
charged group by alkylation, all amine groups in the PPI dendrimer
need to be tertiary in nature (thus becoming quaternary upon alkylation;
see Figure S1). To assure this, we choose
the first step in the modification of the PPI dendrimer to be the
double methylation of the outer, primary amines using the Eschweiler–Clarke
reaction, as this can be run to full conversion to yield dendrimers
with tertiary amines only (Scheme 1).37,38 In contrast, direct alkylation
of both the primary and tertiary amines of the PPI dendrimer with
an appropriate alkyl halide (that also provides a negative charge)
would make the dendrimers over-alkylated and thus bearing an overall
negatively charged, as the alkylation agent would alkylate the primary
amines up to three times. Via the Eschweiler–Clarke reaction
this is prevented, and the dendrimers can subsequently be made truly
zwitterionic by reacting all the tertiary amines with an alkyl halide
with a protected or free anionic group, possibly followed by a deprotection
step (Scheme 1).39 For the synthesis of ZIDs, we chose to work
with PPI generation 3 (G3) dendrimers (in line with the definition
by Meijer and co-workers, a PPI dendrimer with 16 end groups is called
a third-generation dendrimer40) because
of their size and the trade-off between the stability under relevant
conditions as mentioned before and low number of defects (as the latter
increases with generation growth).41

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Zwitterionic PPI-CB1 Dendrimers (Colors for the Different
Compounds Are Also Used in the Results & Discussion Section To Label Experimental Data to the Appropriate Compound)
4.1 Synthesis of Zwitterionic
Dendrimer 3 PPI-CB1
As explained above, the
first step in the synthesis of the zwitterionic PPI-based dendrimers
is the methylation of the primary amine groups under Eschweiler–Clarke
conditions, leading to intermediate 2 PPI-Me (Scheme 1).

This first
intermediate, 2, was subsequently characterized using
NMR, IR, and MS. The 1H NMR spectrum of intermediate 2 showed the appearance of a new, sharp singlet at 2.48 ppm
with corresponding integrals that could be assigned to the installed
methyl groups, while the existing methylene peaks of the dendrimer
showed the expected downfield shift (peak a in Figure 1b). Furthermore, IR spectroscopy also showed
the presence of methyl groups as indicated by C–H bending vibrations
at 1456 cm–1 for intermediate 2. Indirectly,
the intensity decrease of the N–H stretch (3360 and 3280 cm–1) and N–H bend (1592 cm–1) bands also indicated the disappearance of the primary amines of
starting material 1 (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 IR (a) and 1H NMR results (b) with
corresponding peak assignment (c) of 1 (PPI—red), 2 (PPI–Me—green)
and 3 (PPI-CB1—blue); and DOSY (d) results of product 3 PPI-CB1. Full assignment of NMR and IR spectra is provided
in the Supporting Information.

Dendrimer 2 can be converted into
a ZID, by reacting it with an appropriate alkylating agent that also
features a negatively charged group (Scheme 1). Initially, we selected sodium iodoacetate
as the alkylation agent to introduce both the positive and negative
charges in a single step. After the reaction, all dendrimer backbone
peaks showed a downfield shift in the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 1b). In addition,
a new peak was observed at 3.97 ppm, corresponding to the CH2 group of the carboxybetaines (peak e in Figure 1b,c). The presence of the carboxylate group
was also confirmed by the C=O stretch peak at 1600 cm–1 in the IR spectrum (Figure 1a). Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) also indicated that
all the assigned signals belonged to one macromolecular structure
by showing the same diffusion coefficient (Figure 1d). Applying the Stokes–Einstein equation
to the data obtained by DOSY, we estimate the hydrodynamic diameter
for 3 to be 3.2 nm (Table S1), which is
in agreement with values reported in the literature for related dendrimers
of similar mass.42,43

GPC data also confirmed
the estimated mass and desired monodispersity of product 3. The observed molecular weight (Mw,
4.1 × 103 g/mol) was in reasonable agreement with
the proposed molecular weight at full conversion (3877), keeping in
mind that the Mw of the zwitterionic,
dendritic structure 3 was calculated using a linear,
nonzwitterionic calibration system. The measured polydispersity (PDI)
of dendrimer 3 was low (1.102), especially given the
multiple consecutive modification steps that led to 3.

Determining the exact conversion of this second reaction
step was found to be challenging because IR is not a quantitative
technique and 1H NMR signals became broad, preventing accurate
integration. Therefore, we initially used 1H–15N HMBC to indirectly measure the 15N NMR spectrum
of compound 3 PPI-CB1 (Figure S10). The indicative methyl 1H peak at 3.28 ppm (also visible
in Figure 1b) was found
to correlate with multiple 15N NMR peaks. This implied
that after modification still different N atoms were present, which
suggests the presence of unreacted tertiary amines and incomplete
conversion.

To be able to quantify this conversion, we made
use of the unique information that XPS can provide about the conversion
from tertiary to quaternary amines, as XPS can reveal the electronic
configuration of the nitrogen atoms. XPS provides both quantitative
and qualitative information on the elemental composition and chemical
environment of elements on a surface. The binding energy of the core
electrons of an element is measured, and from the obtained spectra,
the amount of the element present can be calculated.44,45 XPS is generally used to investigate the chemical composition of
ca. the top-10 nm of surfaces and is not employed as a standard characterization
method for organic molecules. However, following earlier research
in our labs that focused on the extensive characterization of polymers
that are covalently bound to surfaces46−48 or that are strongly
adsorbed onto surfaces,49 we hypothesized
that this technique might also provide unique information in the characterization
of large (meaning: nonvolatile) but well-defined compounds. We therefore
used the technique to characterize organic macromolecules by dropcasting
and drying them from solution on a silicon surface.

In Figure 2 the XPS C 1s and
N 1s narrow-range scans are displayed. By scanning the element peaks
with high resolution, valuable quantitative information about the
chemical state of the element involved can be obtained, which can
be related to the electronic effects of its substituents and thereby
its chemical structure. After methylation, the C 1s scan of intermediate 2 showed solely C–C (285.0 eV)
and C–N (286.0 eV) carbon species, in
accordance with the structure of 2. In contrast, after
alkylation with sodium iodoacetate, an additional peak in the C 1s
narrow scan is visible at 287.7 eV, which points to the presence carboxylate
carbons (−C(=O)–O. Furthermore,
the C–N peak also broadened because
of the increase in the variation of this type of carbon. More importantly,
the XPS N 1s scans provided us with unique information about the fraction
of quaternary nitrogen atoms. Before alkylation, structure 2 shows one sharp peak for tertiary amines (400.0 eV). After alkylation,
compound 3 showed an additional major peak at 403.0 eV,
corresponding to quaternary amines. The ratio of these two peaks shows
that a conversion of approximately 80% was achieved when reacting 2 with sodium iodoacetate.

Figure 2 Narrow scan XPS C 1s (left) and N 1s (right)
data of 1 (top), 2 (middle), and 3 (bottom).

Unfortunately, the quantitative
information about the chemical state of N as obtained by XPS was unique
with respect to the accuracy it offered in determining the degree
of conversion. Such accuracy could not be achieved—and hence
not compared—with results obtained by other, well known, techniques
(e.g., NMR or MS).

As the conversion of the last step was not
100%, there will be tertiary amines left that can be protonated under
physiological conditions, which will lead to dendrimers that are not
permanently charge-neutral as the carboxylate group is needed to compensate
for the positively charged amine. Furthermore, because it is known
that the performance of zwitterionic materials is enhanced with an
increase in hydration of the brush that is linked to its charge density,50 we set out to systematically explore a range
of reaction conditions to optimize this last reaction step.

XPS provided a very powerful and sensitive method to systematically
screen conditions under which the last reaction step could be improved.
In particular, we used XPS (Table 1, Figures S2, S3, and S4) to study the influence of the following parameters:

4.1.1 Steric Hindrance within the Dendrimer
Generations 2,
3, and 4 of the PPI dendrimer were reacted with sodium iodoacetate.
Steric hindrance within the dendrimer was found not to play a significant
role because the conversion did not increase significantly with decreased
dendrimer size (Figure S2).

4.1.2 Solvent Effect
The use of both methyl- and tert-butyl-protected carboxylates allowed us to use an aprotic
polar solvent because both the reactant and the intermediate product
(before deprotection) are soluble in such a solvent, enhancing the
stability of the alkyl halide precursors. We indeed observed an increase
in conversion up to roughly 90% when using protected acids (e,f),
possibly due to the stability of the halide precursors in an aprotic
solvent. However, when using this approach, an extra deprotection
is necessary, which then needs to be quantitative to yield a charge-neutral
ZID (e,h).

4.1.3 Reactivity
We
found a clear difference in conversion when comparing sodium iodo-
and bromoacetate (87% vs 54%) in water, which is in line with expectation
as iodide is a better leaving group in this reaction (a,b). However,
the corresponding reactions with protected acids in organic solvents
showed no significant difference when comparing halide leaving group
(e–h). We postulate that due to the lack of (water-induced)
competitive elimination reactions and the long reaction time (3 days),
in this case both groups eventually reach the same high conversion.

4.1.4 Nature and Size of the Anionic Group
We evaluated both the nature of the anionic head group, which was
either a carboxylate or a sulfonate group, as well as the carbon spacer
length between the opposite charges of the zwitterion pair. We chose
to synthesize CB1 (carboxybetaine, one-carbon spacer) ZID because
it does not allow for Hofmann elimination (resulting in loss of C2H3COO–), in contrast to CB2 (carboxybetaine,
two-carbon spacer) species.51 On top of
that, we compared SB2 and SB3 (sulfobetaine, with two- and three-carbon
spacers, respectively) to study steric effects caused by the precursor.
We indeed found a lower conversion when using the slightly bigger
SB3 compound (c,d). Unfortunately, the precursor for SB1 was not available.

To further evaluate the effect of sterics, we also reacted an ∼80%
converted ZID with methyl iodide as a small, strong alkylation agent,
resulting in near 100% conversion toward quaternary amines (Figure S4). This suggests that indeed for steric
reasons it is practically hard to reach full conversion (for 2, a 93% conversion of the 30 N atoms effectively means that
28 N atoms will be quaternized). While the final product after reaction
with methyl iodide is fully quaternized, it is no longer charge-neutral,
likely thus on average +2, and therefore we did not use it as such
for further studies.

Overall, from this comparative study, we
concluded that the sodium iodoacetate reaction on 1 was
most efficient. For this reaction, the highest conversion was obtained
without the need for an additional deprotection step. A reaction efficiency
of 87% implies for an N30-molecule like 3 that
typically 26 tertiary N atoms have been converted to quaternary N
atoms. As a result, under physiological conditions likely one or two
N atoms will be protonated. The determination of the precise charge
and charge distribution under these conditions are topics of future
investigations in our labs.

4.2 Synthetic
Design of Functional, Zwitterionic Dendrimers
In order to
use the ZIDs for biological or biomedical applications, functional
groups at the dendrimer’s periphery that allow easy modification
are needed. In order to do this, fast, easy, orthogonal and water-compatible
chemistry is required. Given the intrinsic multivalent nature of the
PPI dendrimers, introduction of a functional group can be achieved
through reaction with a predefined number of amine groups of the dendrimer,
provided that both the installed bond and the functional group are
compatible with the conditions of the subsequent reaction steps that
alkylate and add the zwitterionic moieties (Scheme 1). On the basis of these provisions, we relied
on the reaction of PPI with activated esters to form amide bonds to
introduce a new functional group of choice. We chose to functionalize
the dendrimers with alkyne and azido groups as they allow for a range
of click chemistries (Scheme 2).52

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Alkyne-Functionalized
Zwitterionic PPI-CB1 Dendrimers
Note: n = 3 is shown as example, but other degrees of functionalization
are possible; this synthesis was also performed with n = 2 and n = 6; see Supporting Information for details.

To install
an alkyne click handle, PPI dendrimer 1 was first reacted
with a predetermined number of equivalents of an NHS-activated ester
featuring an alkyne group connected with a short linker (forming intermediate
product 4a). The formed product was directly reacted
toward the fully methylated intermediate 5a, using the
Eschweiler–Clarke conditions previously established for the
nonfunctional dendrimer 3 (Scheme 1). Finally, the functionalized, ZIDs with
an alkyne (6a) handle were obtained through reaction
with sodium iodoacetate (again following procedures previously employed
in the synthesis of 3).

In the 1H NMR
spectrum (Figure S11) of the reaction product 6a, we observed characteristic signals for the alkyne groups
(3.33 ppm), as well as for the formed amide bonds (CH2 next
to the amide, 3.36 ppm). On the basis of NMR integration, an average
degree of incorporation of 2.9 for 6a (n = 3) could be determined. To confirm with another technique and
to obtain information about the distribution of the number of functional
groups per dendrimer, we used MS. Unfortunately, the ESI–MS
of methylated intermediate 5a led to fragmentation due
to rearrangements within the dendrimer, most probably due to ionization53 or methylation.54 This prompted us to isolate intermediates 4a (both n = 2 and n = 3) for MS analysis to study
the distribution of functional groups over the ZID. MS data nicely
showed a fairly small range of distribution of n =
2 and n = 3 with the desired number of n as center of the distribution (Figures S20 and S21). The final product 6a itself could not be
measured, which we attribute to ionization difficulties of the highly
ZIDs; unfortunately, also with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time
of flight we were unable to get signal.

GPC confirmed the estimated
mass and desired PDI of products 3 and 6a (both for n = 2 and n = 3). The
observed molecular weight was in good agreement with the molecular
weight at full conversion. As also observed for 3, the
PDIs of all three products; 1.102 (3), 1.193 (6an = 2), and 1.138 (6an = 6) were rather low, which is even more remarkable as these are
macromolecules that underwent several consecutive modification steps
(Figures S22, S23 and S24).

To quantify
the incorporation of the functional groups, XPS again proved to be
a valuable technique. Because the carbonyl–carbon that forms
upon forming the amide bond gives a signal that is found at a sufficiently
high binding energy (∼288 eV) to be discerned as a separate
peak in C 1s XPS spectra, it is possible to determine the relative
number of C=O carbons
present in the dendrimer.

In Figure 3 the XPS C 1s data confirm an average incorporation
of 2 and 3 alkyne groups by showing a similar
amount of carbonyl–carbon signals (n = 2 carbonyls
out of 128 carbons in total = 1.6% theoretically, 1.9% is observed)
(n = 3 carbonyls out of 132 carbons in total = 2.2%
theoretically, 3.6% is observed) at 288.2 and 288.1 eV in the upper
graphs for intermediate structure 5a. Furthermore, both
C 1s scans of compound 6an = 2 and n = 3 show a similar transformation upon alkylation as described
before for compound 3 (Figure 2).

Figure 3 XPS narrow scan C 1s data of 5a (top) and 6a (bottom) of n = 2 (left)
and n = 3 (right) alkyne-modified dendrimer. For
reference, a characteristic part of the modified dendrimer is shown.

To extend the versatility of click
reaction-based dendrimer modification, we also synthesized ZIDs with
azide groups. By reacting PPI dendrimer 1 with an NHS-activated
ester that was linked to an azide group via a short oligo(ethylene
oxide) chain (NHS-EO8-azide) group, azide-functionalized
intermediate 4b was formed. This intermediate 4b was further reacted following procedures previously employed in
the synthesis of both 3 and 6a to eventually
yield product 6b (see Figure 4 and Scheme S3 in Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Proposed schematic structure of azide-functionalized zwitterionic
PPI-CB1 dendrimer 6b (n = 3). Please
note that this dendrimer was also synthesized with n = 2 and n = 6.

In the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S13) of reaction product 6b (n = 3), we observed characteristic signals for the ethylene glycol
spacers (3.69 ppm), as well as for the formed amide bonds (3.37 ppm).
DOSY indicated that all the assigned signals, including the functional
groups, belonged to one macromolecular structure by showing the same
diffusion coefficient (Figure 5), confirming that the low-molecular weight functional groups
were successfully linked to the high-molecular weight dendrimer. We
also observed a trend in increased diffusion constant with increasing
size and expected molecular weight of the ZID (Figure 5): applying the Stokes–Einstein equation,
the hydrodynamic diameters for 3, 6a, and 6b were estimated to be 3.2, 4.1, and 5.1 nm, respectively
(Table S1). Unfortunately, dynamic light
scattering proved to be impossible to use as a complementary technique
to determine the dimensions of our dendrimers, which is most likely
the result of the relatively small size of the dendrimers. As a result,
we also could not determine the zeta potential to get more insight
into the charge distribution within the dendrimer structures.

Figure 5 DOSY spectra
of unmodified PPI-CB1 dendrimer 3, alkyne-modified 6a PPI-CB1, and azide-modified 6b PPI-CB1 (both n = 3). In the functionalized dendrimers, the most indicative 1H signal is labeled by a star (*). In all three spectra, the
signals in the highlighted band correspond to the ZID, and the signals
at 4.8 and 0.0 ppm represent water and TMS, respectively. Furthermore,
theoretical molecular weights (at full conversion) are given.

Unfortunately, though not fully
unexpectedly, in the IR spectrum, the alkyne and azide signals could
hardly be discerned for 6a and 6b (both n = 2 or n = 3) because the abundance of
these groups in the large dendrimer is relatively low (namely only
2 or 3 alkyne or azide groups per 4000–5000 g/mol structure).
Fortunately, because of the modularity of the synthetic route (Scheme 2), the synthesis
of functional dendrimers with a higher number of functional groups
(reaction with 6 equiv instead of 2 or 3 equiv) was straightforward.
For these n = 6 dendrimers, it was possible to observe
by IR spectroscopy the alkyne and azide groups at 2115 and 2106 cm–1, respectively (Figure S19). Hence, these IR measurements provided further experimental evidence
for the successful incorporation of the functional alkyne and azide
moieties.

As a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate
that our installed click handles can indeed be used for (bio)functionalization,
we introduced a biotin moiety onto the alkyne-containing ZID 6a (n = 3) by reacting the latter with an
azide-functionalized PEG-biotin derivative as shown in Scheme S4. NMR data nicely showed the corresponding
signal for the proton in the formed triazole at 8.13 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum after extensive dialysis, providing evidence
that the biotin was successfully coupled to the ZID (see Figures S15 and S16).

5 Conclusions
In this work, we showed the design and optimized synthesis of (nearly)
charge-neutral, multivalently clickable ZID. The effect of different
parameters on the conversion toward a fully zwitterionic system was
established, leading to an optimized synthesis protocol. In this optimization
study, XPS, which so far was mainly employed for surface characterization,
proved to be a very valuable technique to analyze macromolecules by
providing information about the degree of conversion in these highly
functional dendrimer structures. Furthermore, we developed a modular
synthetic approach to incorporate a variable number of alkyne or azide
functional groups, which allow for covalent (bio)functionalization.
Proof-of-principle coupling of an azide-biotin conjugate by click
chemistry showed that the ZID indeed can be further functionalized.
The fact that multiple, or ultimately even different, functional groups
can be incorporated will further enhance the (bio)applicability of
this kind of ZIDs.
