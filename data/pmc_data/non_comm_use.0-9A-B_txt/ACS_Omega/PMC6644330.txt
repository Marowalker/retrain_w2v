We describe a simple miniature shake-flask
method to measure the
octanol–water partition coefficient of an organic compound.
Partition between water and octanol is performed in an NMR tube; the
aqueous phase is analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy using
a benchtop low-field NMR instrument. Neither pre-equilibration of
solvents nor isolation of the two phases is required. The procedure
is fast and easy enough to be used in a students’ laboratory.
Scope and limitations as well as possible sources of error are discussed

Introduction
A compound’s octanol–water
partition coefficient
(KOW) is a measure of its hydrophilicity/lipophilicity.1 Initially, it was considered in drug and pesticide
discovery and design, but now it is an important characteristic of
any chemical because it determines to a large extent a chemical’s
fate both inside a living organism2 and
in the environment.3,4 For example, biological properties
such as bioaccumulation and toxicity are largely determined by KOW. Therefore, under the European Union’s
chemicals legislation REACH, KOW has to
be determined for every substance manufactured or imported in 1 ton
or more per year. KOW is defined as the
equilibrium ratio of the compound’s concentrations in a two-phase
system of 1-octanol and water. 1  where cOequil = concentration
of the compound under consideration (analyte A)
in 1-octanol in the equilibrium and cWequil = concentration of the analyte in water in the equilibrium.

More exactly, in the partition equilibrium, the octanol phase is
a saturated solution of water in octanol, and the aqueous phase is
a saturated solution of octanol in water.

The KOW values of organic compounds
span many orders of magnitude, and this is one reason why often the
decadic logarithm of KOW (log KOW, also called log P) is listed
rather than KOW itself; a more fundamental
reason is shown below. Log KOW values
are typically between −3 (very hydrophilic) and +10 (extremely
hydrophobic).

Although it is possible to measure KOW of a compound A indirectly by observing its high-performance
liquid
chromatography retention time,5 measurement
according to eq 1 is
the most direct and is considered still the most accurate, though
it presents several pitfalls as discussed early.6,7 In
the simplest case, it requires preparing a solution of the analyte
in either water or 1-octanol, adding the other solvent, achieving
equilibration by shaking, allowing phase separation, and quantifying
the concentrations by any suitable analytical method (“shake-flask
method”). Because compounds differ widely in their solubilities
and analytical properties, various analytical methods have been used,
such as acid/base titration, ultraviolet (UV) photometry, gas chromatography
analysis, and other chromatographic techniques.2,8−10

By contrast, 1H NMR spectroscopy,
though in principle
applicable for most organic compounds, notably for those without UV
absorption, was rarely used for KOW measurements,
probably because quantifying 1H signals of a solute in
the presence of a large excess of water or octanol seems difficult.
To circumvent this problem, deuterated water (D2O) and
perdeuterated 1-octanol (1-octanol-D18) were used, and
the quantification required adding internal standards or using a special
double NMR tube.11 Deuterated solvents
and internal standards were avoided by using the protons in water
and octanol themselves as calibration standards, however, this method
requires varying the excitation pulse angle and applying solvent suppression,
techniques that are available in present-day high-field NMR instruments.12 Stein et al. proposed a special “localized”
NMR method observing analyte concentrations in slices both above and
below the phase boundary in an NMR tube, thus avoiding actual separation
of the two phases.13

In the present
work, it is demonstrated that KOW can
be determined experimentally by 1H NMR
spectroscopy using even a low-field (42.5 MHz) compact (“benchtop”)
NMR instrument that may be available in or affordable for a small
laboratory.14,15 There is no need for special
hardware or software, for deuterated solvents or internal standards.
The method requires low amounts of analyte and 1-octanol (up to 1
and 2.5 mL, respectively, altogether for five parallel runs); it is
simple and fast, in that it involves neither pre-equilibration of
the solvents nor isolation of the two phases.

Method Basics
According to the KOW definition, the
equilibrium concentrations of analyte A in both the aqueous and octanol
phases should be measured. However, when starting with a solution
of A in water and then equilibrating with octanol, it suffices to
measure the concentrations of A in the aqueous phase before and after
equilibration. By mass balance, the equilibrium amount of A in octanol
is given as the difference between the initial amount of A in water
and its equilibrium amount in water. If the volume of the octanol
phase equals that of the aqueous phase, then a corresponding statement
holds for the concentrations; the equilibrium concentration of A in
octanol is the difference between its initial concentration in water
and its equilibrium concentration in the aqueous phase 2  where cWinit is the initial concentration
of A in water.

Because the peak area of an 1H NMR
signal (integration)
is proportional to the concentration of the protons causing it (and
so to the concentration of the compound of interest), we can replace
the concentrations by 1H signal integrations 3  

Absolute integrations, however, are not usually displayed
by NMR
instruments. Moreover, integrations before and after equilibration
may differ because of magnetic-field drift. Such a change in the signal
integration, if any, should be the same for both the signal of interest
and the water signal. For these reasons, we use relative integrations
(RIs), that is, integrations standardized against the integration
of the water peak, RI = I/Iwater. Of course, Iwater is proportional
to the water concentration in the aqueous phase which should be nearly
constant before and after equilibration, as long as the concentrations
of the analyte and 1-octanol in the water phase are low. This means
that water is used as the internal standard.

Equation 3 thus transforms
into eq 4 4  where RIWinit = relative
NMR signal integration of compound
A in water before equilibration with 1-octanol and RIWequil = relative
NMR signal integration of compound A in the aqueous phase after equilibration.

The experiment thus consists of dissolving an amount of compound
A in water in an NMR tube, taking an 1H NMR spectrum, adding
an equal volume of 1-octanol, mixing the phases intensely in the NMR
tube, allowing for phase separation, and again taking an NMR spectrum
of the aqueous (lower) phase (Figure 1). A characteristic peak of compound A is integrated
against the water peak in both spectra (Figure 2). Thus, the first spectrum provides RIWinit, the second
provides RIWequil, and KOW as a first approximation is
calculated according to eq 4.

1-octanol layers upon equilibration.

after equilibration with 1-octanol (bottom).

Representative Procedure
A total of 200 μL (micropipette)
of a water-miscible organic
compound such as acetone and 500 μL of water are mixed in an
NMR tube, and an 1H NMR spectrum is recorded. 1-Octanol
(500 μL) is added, the NMR tube is inverted at least 40 times
for equilibration (shaking should be avoided to prevent emulsification),
the phases are allowed to separate (approximately 5 min), and again
an 1H NMR spectrum (of the aqueous phase) is taken. In
both spectra, the acetone singlet at δ = 2.2 ppm is integrated
against the water peak at δ = 4.8 ppm, whose relative intensity
is set to 1.000 in each spectrum. In a measurement of acetone, RIWinit and RIWequil were found
to be 0.197 and 0.124, respectively (Figure 2), resulting in KOW = 0.589 and log KOW = −0.23.

It is advisable to repeat the steps of phase mixing, phase separation,
and spectrum recording to ensure that partition equilibrium was achieved. Figure 3 shows that in an
experiment with methanol 10 inversions were not enough to approach
the partition equilibrium, while 20 inversions were sufficient. As
in this experiment, we usually performed five parallel side-by-side
runs.

runs (black) and mean (red) after 10, 20, and 30 inversions of the
NMR tube.

In most
cases, after equilibration, the volume of the octanol phase
does not equal that of the aqueous phase, and therefore, the assumption
of equal volumes (used in derivation of eqs 2–4) is not justified.
This is due to the following two effects:(i) The mutual solubility
of water and
1-octanol: while the solubility of octanol in water is very low, the
equilibrium solubility of water in octanol at room temperature is
reported to be about 5 mass percent.17,18 In fact, mixing
equal volumes of water and 1-octanol without any compound A results
in a 5% higher volume of the octanol than that of the aqueous phase
after equilibration, corresponding to a factor of 1.05 in KOW or an additive term of log 1.05 = 0.02 in
log KOW.

(ii) The volume of the analyte is considerable
(up to 200 μL vs 500 μL of water and 500 μL of octanol),
and its near complete stay in the water phase or near complete migration
into the octanol phase may change the volume ratio extensively. In
the worst case, 200 μL of the analyte migrates almost completely
into the octanol phase, leading to a volume ratio of 0.7 mL/0.5 mL,
that is, a factor of 1.4 in KOW or an
additive term of log 1.4 = 0.146 in log KOW (neglecting any possible volume contraction or expansion on mixing
the analyte with solvents).



Both effects
are corrected for by taking the phase volume ratio
into account as a factor in KOW determination
or its logarithm as an additive term for log KOW, eqs 5a and 5b. The phase volume ratio is easily measured using
a ruler as the ratio of the final phase column heights in the NMR
tube. 5a   5b  

The results obtained
according to eq 5b are
shown in Table 1, column
7.

As any equilibrium constant, a compound’s octanol–water
partition coefficient is described by a Boltzmann-type equation, it
is governed by the corresponding free enthalpy difference, that is,
by its free enthalpy of transfer from water to octanol, ΔGtransfer 6a  or 6b  

According to eq 6, KOW depends exponentially on ΔGtransfer, or log KOW depends linearly
on ΔGtransfer. The fundamental reason
for preferring log KOW over KOW itself is the linear
dependence of log KOW on an energy variable
(eq 6b) that in turn
is the sum of energy contributions from structural motifs present
in a molecular structure. Thus, log KOW increases linearly with the number of hydrophobic structural elements
such as methylene groups, benzene rings, and chlorine atoms in a molecule.

Discussion
Method
Basics
Instead of first postulating equal phase
volumes and later introducing the actual phase volume ratio as a correcting
factor, we may retain the volume ratio inherent in the definition
of KOW from the beginning 7  where n stands for the analyte’s
quantity (measured, e.g., in mmol) and v for a phase
volume.

Then, replacing nOequil by nWinit – nWequil and replacing each n by RI as above directly lead
to eq 5a.

Because
the phase volume ratio in an NMR tube is easily measured
using a ruler and is explicitly taken into account in this method,
it is not critical to set the phase volume ratio to a predetermined
value, for example, 1:1. This obviates the need to mutually pre-equilibrate
water and octanol and renders the exact amounts of water and octanol
used uncritical, while the exact amount of analyte A (within its limit
of solubility) does not matter either.

Scope and Limitations
The method requires the analyte
to be sufficiently soluble in water. An NMR signal has to be obtained
that can be integrated against the strong water peak with sufficient
accuracy. A general lower limit of water solubility cannot be given
because the required solubility depends on an analyte’s molecular
mass; number of H atoms in the molecule; and number, chemical shift,
and multiplicity of 1H NMR signals, as well as its log KOW. Moreover, even after equilibration with
1-octanol, the analyte’s remaining concentration in the aqueous
phase has to be high enough for an integrable peak to be observed.
A related limitation is the instrument’s sensitivity: at the
low KOW limit, the difference RIWinit – RIWequil becomes very
small, whereas at the high KOW limit,
RIWequil is
close to zero. Therefore, in the Magritek Laboratory manual,14 only water-miscible liquids of log KOW between −0.51 and +0.43 (measured) or between
−0.34 and +0.46 (literature values) appeared as examples (column
3 in Table 1). In our
experiments, also methyl acetate, n-propanol, and
butanone, compounds fitting in this log KOW range, provided good results.

To extend the amenable log KOW range to the lower side, we subjected 1,4-dioxane,
methanol, DMF, acetamide (a solid), and DMSO to the procedure; the
results were close to the respective literature values for the former
three compounds, whereas acetamide and DMSO showed some deviations.
By contrast, log KOW of the amino acids
glycine, alanine, and proline (zwitterions) could not be measured,
as these did not migrate to any detectable extent from water to octanol,
in concordance with their literature log KOW values of between −3 and −2.19,20

In the direction to higher log KOW,
we tried pyridine, 2-butanol, ethyl acetate, isobutanol, 1-butanol,
methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), diethyl ether, and 2-methyl-THF.
While the first five compounds gave reasonable results, the KOW values of MTBE, diethyl ether, and 2-methyl-THF
were unreproducible because of low solubility combined with high volatility
(the two ethers) or overlapping of the NMR signal with the water peak
(2-methyl-THF).

Larger deviations from the literature were observed
for an acid
(acetic acid) and a base (pyridine). In such cases of partially ionized
compounds, the quantity measured is called log D,
describing the overall distribution of the neutral and the ionized
species, in contrast to log P that describes the
partition of a single species. Ionization depends on both pH and concentration.
For these exploratory experiments, we used unbuffered solutions. Moreover,
in the present method, concentrations are far higher than recommended
for precision measurements (final concentration of acetic acid here
∼0.7 M in the aqueous phase and ∼0.3 M in the octanol
phase versus no more than 0.01 M in either phase, according to the
relevant US Environmental Protection Agency and Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development guidelines).21,22 While for single-species compounds KOW is independent of the concentration, a high concentration favors
the well-known association of acetic acid in nonpolar solvents to
hydrogen-bonded dimers. A corresponding association may also play
a role for acetamide.23

In all previous
variations of the shake-flask method that analyze
one phase only, mutually pre-equilibrated samples of water and 1-octanol
are used to avoid uncontrolled volume changes. Initially, in our experiment,
we waived this precaution for experimental ease, which was justified
by this effect being small compared to the volume effect of the analyte
in most cases. Theoretically, the analyte effect on the phase volume
ratio could be minimized by using a far lower amount of the analyte.
However, in practice, the concentration of the analyte cannot easily
be reduced owing to limited sensitivity of the NMR instrument because
even with the amounts used here the analyte’s NMR signals are
of rather low intensity compared to that of the water peak. Therefore,
in our final procedure, we adjust for both effects by explicitly taking
into account the phase volume ratio (eq 5), easily measured in an NMR tube. For a
thorough discussion of the role of the phase volume ratio in KOW measurement, see ref (10).

In the case of
an alcohol, the signal of all OH protons coincides
with the water peak in the initial spectrum, whereas in the equilibrium
spectrum, some OH protons escape measurement by the alcohol partially
evading into the octanol. This can be corrected for by diminishing,
in the evaluation of both spectra, the water peak by the contribution
of alcohol OH protons, as taken from the observed characteristic NMR
signal of the analyte. For methanol, this correction increased log KOW by 0.04; for ethanol, n-propanol,
and isopropanol, the correction amounted to 0.02; and for t-butanol, it was 0.01. For these alcohols, their corresponding
corrections are included in Table 1, whereas for the other butanols, the corrections were
less than 0.01 and are therefore not included in Table 1. The corresponding correction
for NH2 protons in acetamide was +0.03, and for the COOH
protons of acetic acid, it was less than +0.01.

Sources of
Error
Being a variation of the shake-flask
method, our procedure is in principle subject to potential errors
as described for the shake-flask method in ref (6).

A problem specific
to the present NMR method is the use of the water peak as the internal
standard. After all, we know that the water concentration in the aqueous
phase is not constant. Before equilibration, the aqueous phase contains
up to 29 vol % of the analyte, whereas after equilibration, part of
the analyte and some water are removed in exchange for 1-octanol,
with its OH protons adding intensity to the water signal.

Another
source of error and a severe limitation of the method is
the uncertainty in the NMR peak integration, particularly for peaks
of very different intensities, such as the water peak and the analyte
peak in cases of higher KOW. In addition,
unfortunately eqs 4, 5a, and 5b by their very form
are highly sensitive to measurement errors because of RIWequil, a number
often close to zero, appearing as the denominator. This follows immediately
from the definition of KOW and is therefore
a problem in all KOW determinations for
compounds of very high KOW. Similarly,
for compounds of very low KOW, the numerator
becomes close to zero.

Furthermore, coarseness of the integration
display results in coarseness
of log KOW. For example, a measurement
of isobutanol gave RIWinit = 0.052 and RIWequil = 0.005, resulting in log KOW = 0.97. Had RIWequil been found as 0.004 or 0.006 (the nearest
possibilities with a three-decimal digit display), log KOW would have been found as 1.08 or 0.88, respectively.

Possible Improvements
For compounds with more than
one 1H NMR peak, each peak may be considered separately,
or an average log KOW may be calculated.
However, in many such cases, one peak is more suitable than others.
For example, in 2-propanol, the CH3 doublet is integrated
more reliably than the CH septet; therefore, the log KOW given in Table 1 for 2-propanol is derived from the methyl signal only.

Of course, the method is not restricted to using a low-field instrument.
On the contrary, we expect the method to become even more useful when
profiting from a high-field instrument’s better resolution
and higher sensitivity, which will alleviate some of the limitations
and errors mentioned above. However, even with a compact NMR instrument
as used here, improvement may be achieved if absolute intensities
rather than relative (to water) intensities were displayed. This would
liberate us from using H2O as the internal standard, allowing
treatment of less water-soluble compounds or allowing measurement
in D2O rather than in H2O, both with the effect
to broaden the range of amenable log KOW to higher values.

Conclusion
Within its limitations
(compounds of log KOW roughly between
−1 and +1 and sufficient water solubility),
this miniature shake-flask method is well-suited for fast and easy
experimental log KOW measurement, in particular,
in an educational setting.

Experimental Section
All compounds
were commercial samples of >99% purity except acetamide
(98%) and were used as received. Water was Millipore water of resistivity
18.2 MΩ·cm and 1-octanol was the ACS reagent of ≥99%
purity, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The NMR instrument used was
a Magritek Spinsolve carbon benchtop of 42.5 MHz 1H frequency,
and the NMR tubes were standard thin-wall tubes of size 5 mm ×
178 mm. For integration, the Mnova software (which comes with the
instrument) was used with integrals displayed to three decimal places.
All operations were done in an air-conditioned laboratory at 20–21
°C. The temperature inside the NMR probe, according to Magritek,
is ∼27.5 °C, but the corresponding error can be neglected
because the measurement is fast (≤10 min) and the mass exchange
across the phase boundary in the NMR tube is slow. For the effect
of temperature on log KOW, see the literature.1,6,8,24,25
