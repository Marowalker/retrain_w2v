We demonstrate an all-carbon-based, flexible, conformal movement-capturing
device capable of precisely monitoring biomechanical movements of
both humans and robots. Mechanically robust, metal-free electrodes
form a unique component of the device responsible for qualitatively
and quantitatively transducing biomechanical movements without any
signal artifacts. Importantly, the device withstands and operates
in a wide dynamic range for both stretching (25% strain) and bending
(140°) actions with minimal cycling hysteresis (2.0), high repeatability
(>100 cycles), low creep, and humidity-independent rapid response
(∼200 ms). Furthermore, the device qualitatively distinguishes
movements such as bending of finger, knuckle, and wrist and also provides
quantitative information on the extent of such movements. We establish
that single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded in ultralow concentration
(0.016 wt %) within an elastomeric matrix undergo three-dimensional
conformational changes during biomechanical movements that are subsequently
transduced as signals. In addition, such CNT–elastomer strips
exhibit enhanced stretchability (>100%) and elasticity (∼77%)
in comparison to those of pure elastomers, leading to a wider dynamic
working range of the device. Furthermore, seamless integration of
a versatile gesture tracker on ubiquitous platforms, such as human
skin, kinesiologic tapes, gloves, and robotic arms, is achieved, thereby
catering to applications ranging from healthcare monitoring and physiotherapy
to robotics and wearable technologies.

1 Introduction
Kinesiologic
monitoring of human motion has been garnering increasing
attention in diverse areas, such as wearable technologies, personalized
point-of-care health monitoring systems, military, and robotics.1−3 Furthermore, several physiotherapeutic restorative procedures such
as stroke rehabilitation and prosthetic compatibility demand precise
and point-of-care kinesiologic monitoring and tracking of various
gestures. There has also been a paradigm shift in computing, toward
technologies employing gesture tracking as input. Such gestures are
often composed of multiaxial movements, such as bending, flexing,
and twisting of various limbs. A device capable of achieving such
kinesiologic movement capture has to exhibit a wide dynamic working
range, high sensitivity to movements, ability to distinguish different
types of movements, and quantify the extent of movement in addition
to biocompatibility, minimal invasiveness, mechanical robustness,
and ease of use.

Toward this end, technologies aimed at capturing
human motion are
predominantly based on either micro-electromechanical systems (MEMSs)4−6 or electrically conducting polymer composites (ECPCs)7−10 or optical motion-capture techniques.11 Although MEMS technologies rely on engineering novel architectures
with Si as a platform, ECPCs pertain to a class of devices fabricated
on stretchable platforms. The latter class also includes elastomeric
composites with conductive fillers, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
fabricated on a variety of substrates, resulting in piezoresistive
ECPCs capable of capturing human motion.12−17 Such polymer-based platforms exhibit high degree of mechanical robustness
but suffer from poor sensitivity toward precisely detecting mechanical
movement. Furthermore, the performance of such devices exhibits a
strong dependence on their ambience, such as relative humidity (RH)
and temperature, resulting in ambiguity in the interpretation of the
signals. In contrast, MEMS-based platforms are very sensitive and
precise and are not affected by environmental conditions but are limited
by their dynamic working range and challenges in direct interfacing
with the epidermal layer. Importantly, designing electrical contacts
to both these classes of devices (MEMS and ECPCs) has been a persistent
challenge due to the ineffectiveness and failure of the contacts when
exposed to physical actions, such as stretching and bending. Optical
motion-capture techniques provide real-time precision but require
dedicated environments and a host of cumbersome facilities and thereby
are not currently adaptable for personalized applications. Thus, a
singular, biocompatible device exhibiting conformal attachment to
the epidermal layer of skin and possessing the ability of detecting
and precisely quantifying the movement of the associated limbs without
compromising on the sensitivity and dynamic range is highly desirable.

Addressing this demand, we report a kinesiologic, bodily movement-capturing
device composed of a CNT–elastomeric strip that is capable
of precisely tracking multidirectional and multiaxial movements associated
with human limbs over a wide dynamic range (150%), exhibits instantaneous
response (∼200 ms), and has high reliability and reproducibility
with low creep and minimal hysteresis (2.0 for more than 100 cycles).
We demonstrate the real-time qualitative and quantitative tracking
of hand gestures that employ a combination of modes, such as stretching
and bending. Furthermore, the device not only distinguishes different
types of actions but also provides signals that can be quantitatively
assigned to the extent of such actions. Thereby, the device generates
signals that can be used to differentiate actions that employ the
same set of musculoskeletal joints, such as holding a pen or a bottle
or clenching a fist. We show that the CNTs, oriented as three-dimensional
(3D) random networks at a near-percolation threshold concentration
in the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix, undergo distinct conformational
changes under a mechanical stress. Such conformational changes in
the CNTs are transduced using CNT-immobilized yarns embedded in elastomers
and are used as contacts for signal read-out, thereby overcoming the
challenges associated with electrical contacting of such elastomeric
devices. Finally, we demonstrate integration of the device onto a
variety of platforms, such as human skin, kinesiologic tapes, robotic
arms, and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) gloves.

2 Results
Realization of a kinesiologic, movement-capture device involves
symbiotic integration of various critical processes and materials,
as illustrated in Figure 1a. PDMS is chosen as the device platform due to its biocompatibility,
mechanical robustness, and chemical inertness. CNTs with high-aspect
ratios (>105) and high surface areas (∼1000 m2/g) were utilized as a functional component of the device.
Uniform dispersion of the functional component (CNTs) in the viscoelastic
matrix (PDMS) is critical for achieving reliable and reproducible
performance of device. Considering the viscous nature of monomeric
PDMS, direct dispersion of CNTs proved to be a challenge. This was
overcome by employing methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as an intermediary
medium for dispersing CNTs, thereby ensuring a solvent-mediated dispersion
of CNTs into monomeric PDMS. The choice of MIBK as the intermediary
medium originates from its similarity in the solubility parameter
to CNTs,19−21 which ensured their minimal structural damage and
maximum dispersion in the PDMS matrix. Significantly, such an approach
also resulted in a substantially lower percolation threshold of CNTs
(0.016 wt %) compared to that in previous reports.22 These low loading levels correspond to the weight fraction
of CNTs in the PDMS matrix and resulted in an electrical conductivity
of ∼3 × 10–6 S/cm. Subsequent cross-linking
and curing resulted in the formation of free-standing, flexible, and
mechanically robust CNT–PDMS strips (Figure 1a). The uniform dispersion of CNTs in the
final device is reflected as a systematic decrease in transmittance
of the CNT–PDMS strips because CNTs are known to be perfect
blackbody absorbers in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum23 (see the Figure S1, Supporting Information). Finally, incorporation of a transducer involved
interlacing through the CNT–PDMS strips, resulting in the final
device.

Importantly, the transducer also serves as flexible and mechanically
robust electrodes during measurements and has been easily integrated
onto a variety of substrates, in contrast to other reports involving
copper wire and silver paste contacts24 and gold electrodes.25 Thereby, the signal
read-out is facilitated without any motion-induced artifacts from
the electrodes. In addition, the presence of any metallic component
often leads to false read-outs and failure of the device due to resistive
changes produced in the metallic films and contacts, during the mechanical
movements. In fact, this is the primary mechanism operating in metal-film-based
resistive strain gauges that exhibit a limited dynamic working range.
In sharp contrast, we demonstrate the working of our device without
any metallic component and thereby overcome all of these shortcomings
to constituting an important advancement toward wearable components.

The final device thus fabricated (Figure 1a) is a synergistic combination of the mechanical
robustness of the elastomeric matrix and the conductive functionality
of CNTs. Furthermore, the device is composed of (a) a 3D network of
randomly oriented, interconnected CNTs that are embedded in PDMS and
(b) uniformly coated CNTs immobilized on synthetic yarns. The CNTs
form a uniform, conformal coating on the multiply cellulose thread,
as indicated in the SEM image (see Figures 1a and S2). Such
a CNT-based coating results in constriction of the thread diameter,
owing to strong π–π-based van der Waals interactions
between the CNTs, resulting in the final diameter of the CNT thread
to be ∼200 μm (40% reduction in diameter). Significantly,
the CNT thread is also electrically conductive, as demonstrated in Figure S3, Supporting Information.

Owing
to the flexible and elastomeric nature of the constituents,
the device could be twisted and contorted into a variety of shapes,
such as an S-shape involving combination of two opposing 180°
bends (Figure 1a-i)
and a U-shape involving a 360° bend (Figure 1a-ii), without any loss of device integrity.
Furthermore, a variety of physical actions, such as holding a bottle
(Figure 1b-i) and using
a forceps (Figure 1b-ii), can be carried out without any hindrance or restriction from
the device. Importantly, all of these aspects apply uniformly to every
part of the device unlike previous reports12 wherein the contact for signal acquisition has to be preserved in
a rigid environment to prevent contact-induced signal distortions.
All of the above-mentioned features are corroborative in nature and
point to mechanical integrity of the device during various modes of
movement exhibited by humans, machines, and their interfaces.

Importantly, the device conformally attaches to a variety of soft
and hard surfaces, such as the epidermal layer of human skin, NBR
gloves (Figure 1b-i,ii),
kinesiologic tapes (Figure 1b-iii,iv), plastic-based robotic arms (Figure 1b-v,vi), glass and silicon surfaces, an aspect
critical for versatile usage ranging from humans to robots. Although
van der Waals in nature, a medical adhesive assisted the attachment
and prevented any slippage during the measurements. The device remained
adherent and retained its configuration and functionality for over
a month on all of these surfaces.

The electrical resistance
across the device was monitored using
the CNT thread as a transducer during repeated movements at the desired
locations. Systematic measurements were carried out by bending the
robotic arm and monitoring the changes in resistance produced during
the movements. A highly reproducible and reversible change in the
resistance (40 kΩ) across the device, pertaining to the normal
(Figure 1b-v) and bent
states of the robotic arm (Figure 1b-vi), was observed during such measurements. In addition,
the response from the device reverts back to the original state upon
relaxation of the robotic arm, indicating minimal fatigue and hysteresis
(Figure 1c). Detecting
humanlike movements in real time, generated artificially on differing
platforms, signifies an important step toward the development of robots,
artificial muscles, and robot-assisted surgeries in healthcare.

Extending this for detecting human motion, the device could be
conformally attached at specific locations on a human hand, such as
the proximal interphalangeal (IP) joint, metacarpophalangeal (MP)
joint, and carpometacarpal (CM) joint. These proximal joints are predominantly
involved in dexterity and gesturing and thus are of interest for the
proposed applications. The angle of bending is defined as the angle
described by the joint in moving from its normal configuration (Figure 2a-i) to the bent
configuration (Figure 2a-ii). The tracking signal constituted a resistance change and is
monitored both during the course of movements and in the final positions.
Specifically, a smooth, continuous decrease in resistance by ∼80
kΩ is observed during the bending of the IP joint across a maximum
permissible angle of 140° (Figure 2a). Consequent relaxation to the normal configuration
resulted in restoration to the original value (4160 kΩ). Repeated
cycling of the device (over 100 cycles) through the action of the
IP joint produces precise, highly reproducible, and consistent signals.
Such uninterrupted, in situ motion capturing demonstrated with our
device indicates its substantial advantage over conventional MEMS
platforms that are capable of detecting only the initial and final
positions and not the intermediary states.

joints. (d) Variations in the signal generated by bending the same

ambient humidity conditions (44 and 92%). (f) Evolution of signals

Extending the versatility of the gesture tracking device,
it is
observed that action of other joints, such as MP (Figure 2b) and CM (Figure 2c), on the same hand produces
distinctly different signals that are both indicative of the site
of bending and proportional to the angle of bending. Thus, distinctly
different signals are obtained across the three joints investigated
(IP, MP, and CM joints), in spite of their proximity to each other.
Common to all of these signals is the fact that the resistance decreases
upon bending of the joint and is restored to its initial value upon
relaxation of the joint. The absence of any hysteresis during repeated
measurements indicates no mechanical fatigue of the device and augurs
well for its long-term usability. Importantly, the magnitude of resistance
change is observed to be strongly associated with the extent of mechanical
movement occurring at a particular joint. The three joints tested
here bend to different extents (maximum bending of 140, 90, and 80°
for IP, MP, and CM joints, respectively; Figure S4, Supporting Information) and correspond to the bending of
finger, knuckle, and wrist. Accordingly, changes in resistance pertaining
to these movements are 80 kΩ (IP), 20 kΩ (MP), and 25
kΩ (CM), respectively, and are thus proportional
to the extent of biomechanical movement. Furthermore, the device exhibits
the ability to distinguish between differing extents of movement occurring
across a given joint. This is illustrated with experiments performed
by bending the IP joint to differing extents ranging from 30 to 140°
(Figure 2d). It is
to be noted that these angles correspond to gestures such as holding
a bottle (30° bending), using a forceps (90° bending), and
a clenched fist (140° bending). Distinctly different changes
in resistance from the device (signals) located at the IP joint are
observed corresponding to each of the gestures made, with the magnitude
of the signal being proportional to the extent of bending. Thus, gesturing
of a clenched fist produces a higher change in the resistance (55
kΩ) as compared to that from holding a bottle (10 kΩ)
or using a forceps (5 kΩ), correlating to the associated bending
angles. Thus, a unique ability to qualitatively distinguish between
the type of action and simultaneously quantify the extent of action
at the site of various musculoskeletal joints is demonstrated.

Additional advantage of the device lies in its robustness to its
immediate ambience, specifically humidity. Although the absolute value
of resistance is inherently dependent on the ambient humidity, the
response of the device to biomechanical movements is observed to be
invariant to the humidity levels ranging from RH 40 to 90% (Figure 2e). The CNT thread
is able to reliably transduce the signals from the CNTs embedded in
PDMS, thereby retaining the device performance without the requirement
of any additional packaging. Thus, the tracking signal (resistance
change) is independent of the ambient humidity, exhibiting distinct
advantages over that from previous reports that either exhibited a
humidity-dependent response or required additional packaging to shield
it from ambience.12 Such a humidity-invariant
response is particularly important for applications related to direct
interfacing with skin, which experiences profuse variations in humidity.26

Real-time movement capture also demands
the generation of instantaneous
response across a wide dynamic working range. To evaluate this aspect,
the evolution of signal during both the bending of the biomechanical joints (IP,
MP, and CM) and their subsequent relaxation to the normal position
was analyzed (Figure 2f). The response time of the device is defined as the time delay
between the start of the movement and the stabilization of the signal.
It is observed that the response time of the device is independent
of the initial and final states during the action and is determined
by the extent of action occurring at the joint. Thus, the bending
of finger involving the largest arc length (9.7 cm) produces the quickest
time for response and restoration (∼300 ms), whereas the bending
of wrist involving the smallest arc length (5.5 cm) exhibits the slowest
response and restorative time (∼550 ms) (Figure 2f). The action of knuckle also follows this
trend with an arc length of 6.3 cm and a response time of ∼400
ms. Significantly, experiments carried out with robotic arms, capable
of faster movements, generate a quicker response from the device (∼200
ms) (Figure 1c). It
is to be noted that all of the measurements were carried out in time
steps of 50 ms. The response time ranging from 300 to 550 ms is of
similar order, as observed in a previous report.27 Although the response of our device is 1 order of magnitude
slower than the best reported value,12 the
ease of fabrication, absence of metallic contacts as electrodes, and
extensive packaging are the significant advantages for commercial
realization of the technology.

The various capabilities of the
device demonstrated here can be
directly correlated to the structural organization of CNTs in the
PDMS matrix and the resulting architecture of the device. A variety
of approaches were adopted to understand the nature of distribution
and networking of CNTs in the PDMS matrix. First, a 3D volume element
(15 × 15 × 15 μm3) of the device was reconstructed
from two-dimensional (2D) images generated on the basis of contrast
difference between iodine-doped CNTs28 (see Figure S5, Supporting Information) and PDMS,
through four-dimensional X-ray microscopy (Figure 3a). Thus, the darker areas of the volume
element correspond to the presence of iodine-doped CNTs and the lighter
areas correspond to the carbon framework of the elastomeric matrix.
As shown (Figure 3a),
the dark and light areas of the reconstructed volume element show
a 3D, continuous, interpenetrating structure, indicative of homogenous
distribution of CNTs in the PDMS matrix. Furthermore, the relatively
equal proportion of the light and dark areas indicates the absence
of any significant phase separation or domain formation. The high-aspect
ratio (>105) and specific surface area (∼1000
m2/g) of the CNTs are critical to achieve such high volume
coverage
by CNTs, in spite of their low weight fraction (0.016 wt % CNTs).

and spectroscopic 3D structure. (a) Four-dimensional

of regions occupied by the (a) filler (yellow), (b) matrix (black),
and (c) homogenous filler–matrix interface (red).

Second, more detailed aspects of the CNT distribution
are investigated
through confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy that relies on the distinctly
different vibrational signatures of the CNTs and PDMS. The characteristic
peaks including radial breathing mode, D-band, and G-band are observed
for CNTs at 182, 1344, and 1580 cm–1, respectively.
Similarly, the peaks centered at 2940, 717, and 500 cm–1 are attributed to C–H stretching, Si–C symmetric stretching,
and Si–O–Si stretching modes, respectively (Figure 3b). Thus, confocal
spectroscopic mapping based on the peaks centered at 1580 cm–1 (G-band, Figure 3c) and 2940 cm–1 (C–H stretching, Figure 3d) are carried out.
The randomly distributed nature of the CNT network mimicking polymeric
chains is evident from such spectral mapping. Furthermore, the CNTs
are seen to branch out from each other while remaining connected at
discrete parts in a fractal-like geometry. In fact, the spatial distribution
of the CNTs in the PDMS matrix resembles dendritic structures with
a dense core and arms spreading out in all three directions (see Figure S6, Supporting Information). In addition,
Raman spectra collected at different points of the spectral map indicate
a large area that is primarily composed of the interface between CNTs
and PDMS (Figure 3c).
This further confirms the fractal-like distribution that provides
it a large interface area with PDMS. Thereby, seamless integration
into each other, an aspect critical for the low fatigue and mechanical
reinforcement, is observed in the device.

Having spectroscopically
and microscopically established the 2D
network structure of CNTs, the analysis was extended to confocally
image a 3D volume element of the device (20 × 20 × 10 μm3). Such an analysis is critical for correlating the observed
properties to the 3D microscopic structure of the device. Confocal
2D spectral maps taken at different depths of the sample (see Figure S7, Supporting Information) were overlapped
to generate a 3D distribution profile of CNTs in the device (Figure 4a). This reveals
the continuous nature and fractal geometry of the CNTs extending across
all three dimensions of the device. The spectral maps taken at different
depths (1 μm apart) of the sample are combined to illustrate
the nature of such continuous, fractal-like geometric distribution
of CNTs. Represented three dimensionally (Figure 4b), it reiterates the microstructure distribution
of CNTs that traverses all such confocal layers in a continuous fashion
and thereby electrically interconnects all of these layers.

Figure 4 Quantitative
and spectral mapping of CNTs. (a) Overlapped spectral
confocal images based on the G-band (1580 cm–1)

size of 1 μm. (b) Three-dimensional representation of confocal
spectral maps with the z axis color bar pertaining
to various depths of the device. (c) Confocal laser scanning images
of the device corresponding to 0.016 wt % of CNTs, recorded at sample
depths of (i) 4 μm, (ii) 40 μm, (iii) 80 μm, and
(iv) 100 μm. (d) CNT coverage at different depths of the device.

Finally, quantification of the
CNT coverage is carried out through
confocal transmission microscopy (Figure 4c). The images collected at different depths
are analyzed (ImageJ-FlaxLac_2,5) to form 2D binary black and white
images. Because CNTs are known to be blackbody absorbers,23 any black region corresponds to CNTs and optically
transparent region corresponds to elastomeric matrix. Thereby, the
CNT coverage in each confocal layer is quantified by estimating the
proportion of black area to the total area sampled (Figure 4d). The CNT volume coverage
is found to be ∼65% irrespective of the sampling depth (see Table S1 and Figure S8a, Supporting Information). Besides indicating the uniformity of CNT dispersion, this also
indicates the high volume fraction coverage of CNTs (∼65%)
that has been achieved at low loading levels (0.016 wt %). Reinforcing
these observations, the cross-sectional SEM images indicate a homogenous,
continuous, networked structure of CNTs when dispersed in PDMS (Figure S8b, Supporting Information). Importantly,
there is no phase separation or segregation of the CNTs and PDMS in
the strip, an aspect critical for the effective functioning of the
device. Thus, the use of CNTs with high-aspect ratios (>105) is absolutely essential because the percolation threshold
of the
filler varies inversely with its aspect ratio, that is, spherical
conductive fillers, such as activated carbon and carbon black, would
be required in much higher concentrations to establish continuous
conductive pathways in comparison with fibrous structures, such as
nanotubes (see Figure S6, Supporting Information).

Combined analyses of all of these approaches reinforce the
importance
of high-aspect ratio CNTs and the importance of the methodology adopted
for device fabrication. Thus, even though the CNTs are employed at
an ultralow, near-percolation threshold concentration (0.016 wt %),
the effectiveness of the dispersion ensures their uniform and three
dimensionally continuous, interlinked networking through the elastomeric
matrix, thereby providing an exceptionally high volume coverage (∼65%).

Such homogeneous blending of CNTs and PDMS is reflected in the
exceptional enhancement of the mechanical properties of the device
compared to that of pristine PDMS. Tensile testing of the device indicates
a substantial increase in both the Young modulus and the ultimate
tensile strength (UTS) of the device when compared to those of pristine
PDMS (Figures 5a and S9a). Specifically, the Young modulus is enhanced
by 77% from 1.3 MPa (pure PDMS) to 2.3 MPa (device) with the UTS increased
by over 100%. Concurrently, the yield strain of the device is observed
to increase by 25%. Addition of CNTs produces a reinforcement effect
on the PDMS matrix, which can be attributed to two synergistic effects:
(a) extended polymerization of the monomeric dimethylsiloxane through
free-radical stabilization by CNTs29,30 and (b) enhanced
dispersion of CNTs and PDMS due to their similar solubility parameters.17−19 Thus, the cumulative effect of CNT addition results in (a) increased stretchability
(high UTS and high yield point), leading to a wider dynamic working
range of the device, and (b) enhanced elastic reversibility (high
Young’s modulus), resulting in its low creep, low fatigue,
and higher repeatability and reusability. Considering that such significant
enhancements are generated due to addition of ultralow concentration
(0.016 wt % and 65 vol %) of CNTs, a strong correlation between the
3D, structurally interconnected pathways of CNTs in the PDMS matrix
and the mechanical reinforcement is conclusively established. It is
to be noted that similar strain sensors employing CNTs work at significantly
higher filler loading that could lead to self-aggregation-induced
degradation of mechanical properties. Therefore, the high-aspect ratio
(>105) of CNTs and their seamless integration into PDMS
operate symbiotically to mechanically reinforce the device.

of the normal and stretched states of the device. The compressive
stress (blue arrows) generated due to the tensile stress (green arrows)
results in increased contacts of the dispersed CNTs with the CNT thread,
leading to reduced resistance.

Reproducible operation and reliable signal generation form
an important
aspect of such biomechanical motion-capture devices. Quantification
of these aspects was carried out by repeated cyclic tensile testing
of the device using a custom-built jig (see Section 4 for details) and simultaneously monitoring its electrical response (Figure 5b). Unlike real-time
biomechanical tracking, such testing enabled quantifiable and reproducible
loading–unloading tensile stress–strain cycles to be
carried out on the device to gauge its performance (Figure 5c). The device exhibits a highly
uniform response over 100 loading–unloading cycles with a standard
deviation (SD) of 2.0 (Figure 5d). We also note that a device fabricated with a shorter CNT
thread length (transducing element) provided a low SD of 0.06 with
a relative SD of 0.47% (see Figure S9b,c, Supporting Information). This confirms the absence of any mechanical fatigue
or failure due to repeated usage and is in excellent agreement with
the enhanced elasticity and UTS values reported here.

Critical
factors determining the performance of the device are
the length and configuration of the transducing CNT thread. As described
previously, a longer length of CNT thread interlaced through the CNT–PDMS
strip provides a larger magnitude of response, pointing to a direct
correlation between the response and interaction length. Using a shorter
CNT thread invariably results in configurational changes, resulting
in inability to decouple the two effects. However, experiments conducted
with shorter CNT thread lengths (50% shorter) and close-spaced configuration
exhibit a lower value of resistance (83% lower) (see Figure S9b,c, Supporting Information) in the normal configuration.
Furthermore, the response to biomechanical movement from such a device
is also smaller. Given that the electrical resistance of the CNT thread
depends only on its length and cross section (ohmic) and is invariant
to mechanical movements, the response of the device is also observed
to follow this behavior (see Figure S3b, Supporting Information). Furthermore, this also confirms that the CNT
thread by itself does not play a direct role in the biomechanical
tracking and reinforces that the movement-capturing mechanism involves
the CNTs embedded in the PDMS matrix.

To understand the underlying
mechanism of signal generation, we
carry out in situ electromechanical measurements by measuring the
changes in resistance across the device during its tensile testing
(Figure 5e). The relative
change in the resistance (ΔR/R) exhibits a bimodal behavior with extension (Figure 5f). The first part consists of a linear change
up to an extension of 7 mm (∼26% strain). Subsequently, a saturation-like
behavior up to an extension of 12 mm is observed, beyond which the
device fails (∼40% strain). Any tensile testing is accompanied
by the generation of a simultaneous compressive stress in the transverse
direction. Poisson’s ratio indicates the extent of generation
of such compressive stress (Figure 5g). We observed a similar constriction of the device
during the tensile stretching, owing to the positive Poisson ratio
of the PDMS matrix (0.5 for PDMS). Driven by this compressive stress,
the three dimensionally networked, randomly oriented CNTs embedded
in the PDMS matrix reorient and reconfigure (see Figure S6, Supporting Information). Such an effect is observed
to produce aligned CNTs in elastomeric matrices, such as PDMS and n-butyl nitrile, at higher elongations.31 In our device, because the CNTs are present at concentrations
very close to the percolation threshold, such reconfigurations of
the CNT networks are manifested as changes in the resistance across
the CNT–PDMS strip. The CNT thread traversing through the CNT–PDMS
strip captures and transduces such changes in electrical resistance
that are consequently observed as signals during the experiments.
Because the reconfiguration of CNT networks is directly proportional
to the compressive stress generated, the response in this regime is
expected to exhibit a linear dependence, as is seen in the first part
of the response curve (Figure 5f). Compressive stress beyond this regime (∼26% strain)
does not result in any appreciable change in the CNT network, leading
to saturation of the signal generated, as seen in the latter part
of the response curve (Figure 5f). This bimodal behavior is exactly reproduced in our in
situ experiments as noted above, confirming the mechanism. Such a
mechanism operating in this device is thus a symbiotic combination
of (a) high Poisson’s ratio, resulting in changes to the electrical
pathway in the device, and (b) the dedicated and precise transduction
of these signals by the CNT thread, operating simultaneously during
the biomechanical movement. Finally, the saturation domain pertains
to the region where the CNT thread embedded in the composite is likely
to feel the effect of the tensile stress and therefore does not produce
an appreciable response. Any subsequent stretching (>40% strain)
results
in either the mechanical failure of the device or the electrical breakdown
of the percolation pathway, both of which are irreversible in nature.
The proposed mechanism is further confirmed by control experiments
carried out with a pure CNT thread, where no such changes are observed.

Strain sensors based on thin films of aligned CNTs operate based
on buckling of the film parallel to the strain axis and are operationally
similar to the structural deformation of open-mesh geometries. Although
operational under high strain12 (280%),
these devices are extremely difficult to fabricate, require careful
packaging to remove ambient effects, and demand extensive electrode
fabrication for contacting. In contrast, the device reported here
performs under varied humidity conditions without the need for any
additional packaging or electrode fabrication and is thus implementable
directly on wearable platforms. This has been demonstrated through
measurements of our device on platforms ranging from human skin and
kinesiologic tapes to robotic arm and NBR gloves. Other reported CNT-based strain sensors largely
operate on their preferential alignment during strain. We note that
the device in our case is also driven by Poisson’s ratio, although
the mechanism of capturing the reconfiguration of the CNT network
is completely unique. The CNT thread embedded in the device is able
to precisely capture minor reconfigurations of the CNT network due
to mechanical deformation. Furthermore, our device operates at significantly
lower loading of CNTs (0.016 wt %) compared to that in any other previous
report,32−35 to the best of our knowledge. This is also responsible for low creep
and fast response observed in our device. Furthermore, the final device
does not exhibit any sensitivity to the ambient conditions, such as
temperature and humidity levels, in contrast to that in other reports.12−14 In addition, the integration of the CNT thread onto the elastomeric
platform provides a facile method for the measurement of signal and
easy interfacing with a variety of surfaces, such as skin, fabric,
robot, and gloves.

A comprehensive comparison of the performance
and attributes of
our device with those reported in the literature is given in Table 1. Although nanocarbons
form the predominant choice of the active material, metals and their
composites remain the only choice of the electrodes and contacts.7,12−14,16,22,24,35,37−39 Furthermore, considering
that most of these devices target wearable applications, there are
substantially few investigations on the effect of ambient humidity
and temperature on the performance of these devices.12,13,22,38 Exceptional device performance, sensitivity, and response time have
been achieved through a variety of lithographic and nonlithographic
procedures, with the weight fraction of the active material ranging
from 0.5 to 50 wt %. In contrast, this report presents the first metal-free, all-carbon device exhibiting
fast response time, humidity-invariant response, and excellent reproducibility
for ∼25% strain along with excellent versatility for integration
into arbitrary platforms. The stretchability and mechanical robustness
of our device require improvement, which is being currently pursued
through engineering the PDMS curing conditions and the optimization
of dispersion parameters of CNTs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a versatile movement-capturing device
employing CNTs as both the functional and transducing components that
has been seamlessly integrated onto a variety of ubiquitous platforms.
The response from the biomechanical tracking device has been shown
to be highly specific to the site of movement and the nature of gesturing.
Furthermore, the device enables real-time, continuous, quantitative
tracking of movement with signals being directly corroborative of
the extent of movement occurring at each musculoskeletal joint. In
addition, we have demonstrated an environment-independent response
from the device, enabling its direct integration for various applications
ranging from physiotherapeutic recuperation and wearable technologies
to robotics and defence, where real-time feedback on the type and
extent of movement is essential.

4 Experimental
Section
All chemicals and materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and
were used directly without any purification, unless mentioned otherwise.

4.1 Synthesis and Dispersion of CNTs and CNT Thread
CNTs
were synthesized through the water-assisted chemical vapor
deposition18 technique with high purity
(∼99%, specific surface area ∼1000 m2/g),
uniformity (length ∼350 μm, diameter ∼2 nm), and
high-aspect ratio (>105). The CNTs were dispersed by
probe
sonication (31% power at 30 °C temperature using PKS-750FM; PCI
Analytics Pvt. Ltd.) in 4-methyl-2-pentanone (MIBK). Immobilization
of CNTs on a commercial multiply synthetic yarn was carried out by
dip-coating from aqueous, conductive CNT-ink (0.1 wt %), prepared
using sodium deoxycholate as a stabilizing agent. The yarn was subsequently
dried (100 °C, 30 min) and washed with ethanol to remove the
stabilizing agent to result in a CNT-immobilized conductive synthetic
yarn (CNT thread). The conductivity of the CNT thread was estimated
from two-probe measurements. Iodine doping of as-prepared SWCNTs was
carried out by placing SWCNTs in an iodine vapor atmosphere at 100
°C for 12 h.

4.2 Fabrication of CNT–PDMS
Device
The CNT–MIBK dispersion was added to a preweighed
base elastomer
(Sylgard 184; Dow Corning) and mixed thoroughly to ensure uniformity
and dispersion. The resulting CNT–MIBK-prepolymer slurry was
mixed with the curing agent (10:1 ratio). The resulting dispersion
was mixed thoroughly and carefully poured into the premade molds for
curing. Curing was carried out following the same protocol as that
for pure PDMS to yield free-standing CNT–PDMS elastomeric strips.

4.3 Device Fabrication
The CNT–PDMS
strips were fabricated with varying compositions of CNTs in PDMS.
On the basis of percolation theory, the composite with the highest
loading (0.016 wt %) of CNTs in PDMS was chosen to be the device.
The CNT thread was interlaced through the CNT–PDMS strips,
thereby establishing a contact between the CNTs immobilized on the
thread and the CNTs embedded in the elastomer. Thus, the CNT threads
can be visualized as metallic wires with significantly higher flexibility
and elasticity. Therefore, our approach involved utilizing such conductive
strands to form serpentine pathways in the PDMS elastomeric matrix,
similar to metallic/semiconductor pathways in strain gauges.

4.4 Material Characterization and Mechanical Testing
Micro-Raman
spectroscopy was carried out using a WiTeC micro-Raman
spectrometer equipped with a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet
532 nm excitation laser source. Peak intensities were integrated over
1580 cm–1 (tangential G-band of CNTs) and 2940 cm–1 (asymmetric stretching mode of C–H) to elucidate
the spatial distribution of CNTs and PDMS, respectively. Confocal
single-point depth profiling was carried out over a depth of 10 μm
to ascertain the distribution of CNTs in the PDMS matrix. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy was carried out using AXIS Supra, Kratos Analytical,
Shimadzu, employing an Al Kα source. Absorption spectrophotometry
was carried out using UV-3600, Shimadzu, in the transmission mode
with a pure PDMS sample as the reference. Confocal laser scanning
microscopic imaging in transmission mode was carried out using a FV500
TIEMPO FLUOVIEW microscope. Optical images through a sample thickness
of 200 μm were obtained in a confocal fashion from top to bottom
at sequentially decreasing focal planes. Mechanical testing was conducted
using an Instron 3366 universal tensile machine (American society
for testing and materials (ASTM) D3039), with a capacity of 10 kN
and at a strain change of 0.1 mm/min. Secondary electron microscopy
was carried out using FEI Quanta 200 SEM. Four-dimensional X-ray imaging
was carried out on a 3D volume element, using Xradia Versa 520, Zeiss.
Tensile and bending modes were performed using a custom-built tensile
tester and bending tester-jig that were designed according to the
requirements posed by the composites and confined to ASTM D3039 standards.
The tensile tester consisted of a fixed clamp and a movable clamp,
held in the same plane, onto which the sample was fixed. The movable
clamp was used for repeated tensile testing of the sample. The entire
assembly was fabricated in SS 301 grade steel. The SD for such repeated
testing was calculated through established data analytical methods,
given by  where X represents individual
data points, Xm represents their mean,
and n is the total number of data points.

4.5 Electrical Measurements
KEITHLEY
2110 digital multimeter (DMM), interfaced to computer, was used for
electrical measurements. Two-probe resistance of the CNT thread during
various stages of its fabrication was measured using a Bio-Logic SP-300
electrochemical workstation. The flexibility and mechanical robustness
of the CNT thread enabled treating it exactly like a normal thread.
Thus, either end of CNT threads was twisted across a battery and an
light-emitting diode (LED), respectively, to complete the circuit,
resulting in glowing of the LED. Both the current–voltage measurement
and the demonstration were absolutely invariant for all possible configurational
changes of the CNT thread, such as bending, twisting, stretching,
and winding.

4.6 Real-Time Movement Capturing
The
device was conformally attached to various substrates at arbitrary
sites of measurement using a medical adhesive (to prevent slippage).
Accordingly, the performance of the device was evaluated by directly
interfacing on human skin. Biomechanical movements were also tracked
by attaching the device on NBR gloves and kinesiologic tapes that
were worn on a human hand. Biomechanical movements at various joints
on the human hand, such as the proximal IP joint (finger), MP joint
(knuckle), and CM joint (wrist), were monitored.
Hand movements were artificially simulated using a commercially procured
robotic arm (Robotic Hand, KidzLabs). The signals in all of these
cases were monitored with the help of a KEITHLEY 2110 DMM, at time
intervals of 50 ms interfaced with a computer for automated data acquisition.
The two ends of the CNT thread formed the electrodes for all such
measurements. Measurements were continuously acquired while bending
the joints to various extents.
