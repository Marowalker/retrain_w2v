Amphiphilic molecules
such as surfactants, lipids, and block copolymers
can be assembled into bilayers and form vesicles. Fluorescent membrane
labeling methods require the use of dye molecules that can be inserted
into the bilayers at different stages of synthesis. To our knowledge,
there is no generalized method for labeling preformed vesicles. Herein,
we develop a versatile protocol that is suitable to both surfactant
and lipid preformed vesicles and requires no separation or purification
steps. On the basis of the lipophilic carbocyanine green dye PKH67,
the methodology is assessed on zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine vesicles.
To demonstrate its versatility, it is applied to dispersions of anionic
or cationic vesicles, such as a drug administrated to premature infants
with respiratory distress syndrome, or a vesicle formulation used
as a fabric softener for home care applications. By means of fluorescence
microscopy, we then visualize the interaction mechanisms of nanoparticles
crossing live cell membranes and of surfactants adsorbed on a cotton
fabric. These results highlight the advantages of a membrane labeling
technique that is simple and applicable to a large number of soft
matter systems.

1 Introduction
Amphiphilic
molecules such as double-tailed surfactants, lipids,
or block copolymers can assemble in aqueous solutions into bilayers
and form various structures including liquid-crystal smectic or cubic
phases, multiconnected sponge analogues, or closed vesicles. Membrane
composition, structure, and elastic properties have earned widespread
attention because membrane-based colloids are implemented in many
industrial and medical applications.1 In
chemistry, vesicles enter into topical home care and personal care
formulations through their ability to adsorb onto various substrates.2 In nanomedicine, an important application relates
to drug delivery and the use of liposomes as nanocarriers in anticancer
chemotherapies.3 Under the impetus of biology,
there has been recently a significant increase of novel fluorescence
techniques that allow the visualization of membranes via optical microscopy
and follow complex phenomena in real time.4−7 The interest for fluorescence
microscopy has further increased with the recent discovery of super-resolution
imaging techniques that allow to go beyond the diffraction limit with
optics.8

In this context, it is important
to control the membrane labeling
techniques. For surfactants, the mono- and bilayer labeling takes
advantage of fluorescently tagged amphiphiles9−11 or solvatochromic
surfactant dyes,12 the latter having the
property to change the emission wavelength depending on their environment.
With surfactants, however, it is often found that the dye insertion
modifies the overall assembly properties, inducing a disruption of
micellar or membrane structures. With lipids, the most common labeling
methods are based on lipid film hydration5,6,13,14 or electroformation5,15 in which a small proportion of fluorescently modified lipids is
added beforehand. This technique is suitable for the production of
giant unilamellar vesicles and has shown excellent results.5−7,13 The previous methods are however
not suitable for living cell membranes or preformed vesicles. Here,
we use the term “preformed vesicles” to describe surfactant
or lipid compartments obtained using various chemical or biological
processes and which structure must be preserved upon staining. Preformed
vesicles are, for instance, present in cosmetics or home care formulations.16−18 In biology, they are found in lung fluids or they are the exosomes
secreted by live cells associated with regular trafficking functions.19−21 In recent literature, we have not found any vesicle labeling protocol
that is simple enough and suitable for a broad range of amphiphilic
molecules, including surfactants and lipids. After evaluating several
biology-based staining methods, we show here an easy and versatile
solution to this problem.

In cellular biology, membrane labeling
is commonly achieved using
lipophilic carbocyanine dyes.22,23 These dyes intercalate
spontaneously and noncovalently into the bilayers, thanks to their
aliphatic pending chains, and rapidly stain the outer cellular membrane
through lateral diffusion.24,25 With time, the dye
molecules also spread to intracellular organelles as a result of lipid
exchange. Some of the well-known examples are the carbocyanine fluorescent
dyes PKH (e.g. PKH26 and PKH67) and DiO, DiI, DiD, and DiR which cover
the visible and infrared emission spectrum.21,22,26−28 Direct labeling using
lipophilic dyes can however lead to significant issues. To speed up
the insertion of fluorescent molecules into the membrane, large concentrations
of lipophilic molecules and the use of specific solvents are prescribed,
leading to further complex separation protocols.20,21,27 For preformed vesicles, the difficulty is
augmented because the vesicles and the nonsolubilized dye aggregates
have comparable sizes and densities. In such cases, more sophisticated
separation techniques based on sucrose gradient or on chromatography
are to be implemented.21

Herein,
we develop a versatile labeling membrane protocol that
is suitable to both surfactant and lipid preformed vesicles and requires
no separation or purification steps. The methodology is based on direct
staining using the PKH67 lipophilic green dye (Scheme 1). The protocol design and optimization are
first assessed using dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) preformed
vesicles. The DPPC vesicle features such as the size and charge are
thoroughly investigated and found to be in agreement before and after
the labeling treatment. The protocol is then extended to two types
of vesicle dispersions: (i) an exogenous pulmonary surfactant drug
administrated to premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome
and (ii) a vesicle formulation used as a conditioner in home care
applications. These vesicles differ by their surface charges, the
former being anionic and the latter being cationic. In the end, we
show the benefits of such a staining protocol in two applications,
namely, the role of pulmonary surfactant in the particle internalization
in live cells and the surfactant deposition on cotton fabric.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structure of PKH67 Amphiphilic Dye
The
molecule is made of fluorescent
head groups Z1 and Z2 emitting in the green
(502 nm) emission and two aliphatic chains that are inserted into
the bilayer (see Materials and Methods for
details).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 PKH67 Behavior in Polar Solvents
Dynamic light scattering
was used to study the PKH67 dye solubility
in solvents such as ethanol, deionized (DI) water, phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and Diluent C. In ethanol, no aggregates nor micelles
are observed with light scattering, indicating a good solubility in
this medium. Diluent C is the commercially available solvent for carbocyanine
PKH dyes. It is used primarily to maintain the cell viability while
maximizing the dye solubility in the culture medium. As Diluent C
components may change the vesicle properties (it contains surfactants,
proteins and complexing agents), its use requires post-labeling treatment
such as purification and separation steps. Alternative solvents to
Diluent C are water and PBS, the latter being the reference buffer
in many biological studies. Figure 1a–c displays the intensity distributions of
5 μM PKH67 dispersions in DI water, PBS, and Diluent C, respectively.
The size distributions are obtained from the deconvolution of the
scattered light autocorrelation function and reveal the existence
of nanometer (for DI water and Diluent C) to micrometer (for PBS)
sized aggregates. Obtained by fitting, the continuous lines show maxima
at 400 nm, 1.40 μm, and 430 nm. The results suggest that the
dyes are partially soluble in either of the solvents, a result that
is explained by the hydrophobicity of the fluorescent molecule (Scheme 1). From the aggregate
sizes, it is inferred that the PKH67 solubility in DI water is comparable
to that in Diluent C and better than that in PBS. Because the membrane
labeling efficiency is linked to this solubility, we conclude that
DI water can be an alternative solvent to Diluent C for staining vesicles.

dispersions using (a) DI water, (b) PBS, and (c) Diluent C as a solvent.

2.2 Incorporating
PKH67 Dyes into Lipid Vesicles
Systematic studies were performed
by mixing DPPC vesicles at a
concentration of 1 g L–1 in DI water together with
dye dispersions of increasing concentrations. We followed the scheme
displayed in Figure 2 for the sample preparation and increased the PKH67 molar concentration
from 0.2 to 5 μM. These concentrations correspond to a dye-to-lipid
ratio varying between 1:300 and 1:7000. It was found that at a ratio
of 1:1400, the dyes did not alter the vesicular structure and the
vesicles were fluorescent. The vesicle properties prior and after
labeling were further examined using fluorimetry, light scattering,
and microscopy.

Figure 2 Schematic representation of the protocol used for labeling
DPPC
vesicles in DI water.

Figure 3a
shows
the fluorescence excitation (λex = 490 nm) and emission
(λem = 502 nm) spectra for a 50 nM PKH67 aqueous
suspension and for a PKH67/DPPC dispersion prepared in DI water as
described above. In particular, the dye-to-lipid ratio was set at
1:1400. The fluorescence signal observed for DPPC/PKH67 is 40 times
higher than that of PKH67 alone at the same concentration. The low
fluorescence level found for pure PKH67 dispersion is explained by
the phenomenon of aggregation-caused quenching.29,30 Aggregation-caused quenching takes place when poorly soluble molecules
associate with micelles and aggregates, resulting in concentration-induced
emission quenching. In contrast, the strong signal obtained in the
presence of lipids suggests that the dyes have been incorporated in
the membranes and are spatially dispersed. There, the distance between
the dye molecules is estimated at 30 nm, preventing the self-quenching
to take place. In both cases, the emission occurs at the same wavelength,
showing that the presence of DPPC molecules does not alter the PKH67
photophysical properties.

Figure 3 (a) Fluorescent excitation and emission spectra
of a 50 nM PKH67
aqueous dispersion in the presence and absence of DPPC vesicles. The
lipid concentration is 50 mg L–1 and the temperature
is 25 °C. The arrow indicates that with DPPC, the fluorescence
signal is enhanced by a factor 40. (b) Dynamic light scattering size

(e) Merge of (c,d) showing colocalization.

Labeled and unlabeled vesicles were further studied using
dynamic
light scattering, zeta potential measurements, and optical microscopy. Figure 3b displays the size
distribution obtained for a 1 g L–1 dispersion with
and without PKH67. In the two experiments, the distribution peak is
around 0.8–1 μm. In dilute solutions, the vesicles observed
in 60× phase-contrast microscopy are identified as separated
and immobile objects adsorbed at the glass surface (Figure 3c). With fluorescence, the
vesicles appear as bright spots colocalized with those observed in
phase contrast (Figure 3d). An analysis of the merge image (Figure 3e) leads to the result that more than 80%
of the treated vesicles have been labeled and that their size is not
modified by the staining. These findings confirm that the above protocol
is efficient and does not change the overall vesicle geometry.

2.3 Labeling Biological Lipid and Industrial Surfactant
Vesicles
The previous method was applied to vesicles of different
origin and surface charge. Vesicles made from biological lipids coming
from the pulmonary surfactant drug Curosurf or those made from the
commercial double-chain surfactant TEQ were assessed. We recall that
Curosurf is a lung fluid substitute used for the treatment of respiratory
distress syndrome.31−33 Its composition comprises a wide variety of lipids
(Scheme 2) which impart
an average negative charge to the membrane (Table 1). The TEQ surfactant in turn is a quaternary
ammonium esterquat entering topical softener formulations. In Supporting Information S1 and S2, cryogenic transmission
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) images confirm that both Curosurf biological
lipids and TEQ esterquat surfactants associate locally into bilayers
with a thickness of 4–5 nm and that on a larger scale, the
bilayers form unilamellar and multivesicular vesicles.31Figure 4a,b display the size distributions for PKH67-labeled and PKH67-unlabeled
Curosurf and TEQ dispersions, respectively, obtained from light scattering
at 1 g L–1. In this assay, the Curosurf vesicle
size is controlled via extrusion through a 100 nm pore polycarbonate
membrane.34 The data indicate that there
is a good superimposition of the distributions for the two dispersions.
Electrophoretic mobility experiments show that the zeta potential
remains unchanged with and without labeling, the values being around
−20 and +60 mV for Curosurf and TEQ, respectively (Table 1). In Figure 4c–e,f–h, phase-contrast
and fluorescent microscopy images of native nonextruded Curosurf and
TEQ are presented. The figures reveal well-contrasted spherical objects
of average size 1 μm. As for DPPC, the vesicles appear as bright
spots colocalized with those observed in phase-contrast mode. Of them,
85% are fluorescent and their size distribution remains unchanged.
These findings confirm that the staining protocol developed for zwitterionic
DPPC vesicles can be extended to anionic lipids from biological origin
and to cationic surfactants coming from an industrial source. In the
next sections, we take advantage of this labeling technique to investigate
the interaction mechanisms of nanoparticles crossing live cell membranes
and of surfactants adsorbed on cotton fabric.

2.4 Role of Pulmonary Surfactant
in the Cellular
Uptake of Nanoparticles
When inhaled, nanoparticles are able
to reach the respiratory zone and enter in contact with the alveolar
region.35−37 Various scenarios of nanoparticles passing from the
alveolar spaces toward the blood circulation have been examined, and
in some instances, translocation has been demonstrated.37,38 Our research group has recently explored the behavior of 50 nm particles
and of surfactant substitutes in controlled physicochemical conditions.
Three types of surfactant mimetics, including the exogenous substitute
Curosurf, were assessed together with aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide,
and latex nanoparticles.34 The result that
emerged from this survey (particles were selected to display different
shapes and surface charge densities39)
was the observation of the spontaneous nanoparticle/vesicle aggregation
induced by Coulomb attraction. The aggregation was strongly enhanced
for oppositely charged species. Labeling pulmonary surfactant vesicles,
as shown previously, represents hence an opportunity to further study
the aggregate structure. Figure 5a displays a high magnification view of a silica/Curosurf
aggregate observed under phase-contrast (Figure 5a1), green (Figure 5a2), and red (Figure 5a3) emission. In this assay, the particles
are aminated and fluoresce in the orange-red at 590 nm because of
the rhodamine molecules present in the silica structure. The experimental
conditions are a total concentration of 1 g L–1,
a volumetric lipid-to-nanoparticle ratio of 2, and a temperature of
37 °C.34 The merge image of Figure 5a2,a3 exhibits an
excellent superimposition of the green and red channels over the entire
object, indicating that the aggregates contain both fluorescent species
(Figure 5a4). These
results, together with those of Supporting Information S3, ascertain that the aggregates are made of vesicles and
particles and that both are intertwined at the micron scale (Figure 5b).

Figure 5 (a) Silica nanoparticle/Curosurf
aggregate observed under phase-contrast
(a1), green (a2), and red (a3) illumination. The silica fluoresce
in the orange-red at 590 nm and the vesicles are labeled with a green
fluorescent dye (PKH67) emitting at 502 nm. The merge image of the
red and green signals is shown in (a4). (b) Schematic representation
of a nanoparticle/Curosurf aggregate derived from optical microscopy.

epithelial cells incubated with silica nanoparticle/Curosurf aggregates

(d) Three-color merge images showing cells (d1), plasma membrane (d2),
and cytoplasm (d3). The bars in (d2,d3) are 2 and 4 μm, respectively.
(e) Schematic representation of a cell with adsorbed and internalized
silica nanoparticles.

In the alveolar spaces, inhaled nanoparticles enter first
in contact
with the lipid monolayer at the air–liquid interface and then
with the hypophase.40,41 This interaction leads to an
aggregate formation comparable to the one discussed previously and
is susceptible to modify the fate of the nanoparticles toward the
alveolar cells located beneath the hypophase. In particular, the lipids
are expected to mitigate the protein adsorption.42 Here, the double labeling permits to visualize the vesicle
and particle localization following the cellular uptake. A549 lung
epithelial carcinoma cells were incubated for 4 h with the nanoparticle/vesicle
aggregates shown in Figure 5a. Because of their size and density, the aggregates sedimented
at the bottom of the Petri dish36,43 and enter in contact
with the cell layer. Figure 5c exhibits confocal images of a cluster of five cells in bright
field (Figure 5c1)
and in green and red fluorescence (Figure 5c2,c3, respectively). The nuclei are stained
in blue with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Figure 5d exhibits the merge
image of the three fluorescent signals, together with close-up views
of the plasma membrane and of the cytoplasm. These images demonstrate
that in the presence of lipid membranes, the particles are internalized
in the cells in a significant amount (see Supporting Information S4 for additional data). In this respect, the vesicular
membrane seems not to have a protective role toward cells, as it is
the case with supported lipid bilayers.31 Yellow patches associated with nanoparticle/vesicle colocalization
are essentially visible at the outer cellular range, but not internally
or in a lesser amount. This suggests that after passing through the
outer lipid barrier, a separation of the two components occurs and
that the preformed aggregates break. Figure 5e illustrates schematically this process.
To our knowledge, it is the first time that assays using membranes
of biological origin reveal a separation mechanism for the organic
and inorganic species in cells.

2.5 Double-Chain
Surfactant Deposition on Cotton
Fibers
Recently, we show that the PKH67-labeled vesicles
made from the TEQ double-tailed surfactant could also be used to decipher
the interaction mechanism with cellulose nanocrystals.17 Obtained from natural cellulose,44 cellulose nanocrystals are rod-shaped particles
in the form of 200 nm laths. Being negatively charged, these anisotropic
particles interact strongly with the TEQ cationic vesicles and form
mixed aggregates comparable to those obtained with the silica nanoparticles
and discussed in the previous section. Examples are given in Supporting Information S5.

To evaluate
the performances of a home care product such as a fabric softener,
it is more convenient to use the actual fabric materials for deposition
assessment. Pertaining to the deposition on cotton, important issues
are the amount of adsorbed surfactants and the morphology of the deposited
layer, questions to which labeled vesicles could provide an answer.45−48 In a typical experiment, a 1 × 1 cm2 piece of woven
cotton fabric is treated with a dispersion containing TEQ fluorescent
vesicles at 1 g L–1 during 10 min and then rinse
with DI water. The PKH67 concentration was set at 6 μM for these
assays, which is slightly higher than for DPPC and Curosurf vesicles. Figure 6a displays a phase-contrast
microcopy view of a treated fabric submerged in water. There, the
200 μm sized yarns are recognizable and separated by large voids.
Additional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data confirm the woven
structure (Supporting Information S6).
In the emission mode (Figure 6b), the fibers exhibit an intense fluorescence signal, illustrating
that TEQ surfactants have been adsorbed on the cellulose substrate
in a significant manner. The bright spots (arrows) are assigned to
large TEQ vesicles coating the cellulose substrate. The vesicle adsorption
is explained by Coulomb attraction between the cationic vesicles and
the anionic fibers. Control experiments performed with unlabeled surfactant
show that in the present conditions, the fibers are not fluorescent
and appear dark (Supporting Information S7). An analysis of the distribution of the fluorescence signal along
the fiber cross section shows an enhanced signal on the edges, the
intensity showing an M-shaped signal (Figure 6c,d and the inset in 6c). Such M-shaped signals are characteristic from fluorescence emission
arising from the fluorescent surfaces or interfaces.6,49 Concerning the nature of the absorbed layer, it could come either
from supported lipid bilayers or from a supported vesicle layer. In
the first scenario, the fibers would be coated with a single or with
a stack of surfactant bilayers, whereas in the second scenario, the
vesicles remain intact and stick to the cellulose fibers. Figure 6b,d actually suggest
that both scenarios are here plausible. These two types of surfactant
depositions are schematically presented in Figure 6e. In conclusion, the present technique allows
a direct visualization of surfactants adsorbed on cotton fabric and
should permit to assess the formulation deposition performance.

vesicles are indicated with yellow arrows. The inset in (c) displays
the fluorescence profile along the line A depicted in (d). The fluorescence
maxima are ascribed to the fiber edges. (e) Schematics of surfactant
deposition on cotton fibers assuming either supported lipid bilayer
or supported vesicle layer models.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we report
a fluorescent labeling technique based
on the spontaneous insertion of lipophilic molecules into membranes
made either from surfactants or lipids. The protocol is derived from
methods developed for live cell imaging. Thanks to an accurate dosage
of the dye molecules in solution, here the PKH67 lipophilic green
fluorophore, issues related the removal of the excess dyes or to the use of a specific solvent are avoided.
The PKH67 concentration is namely adjusted to that of the lipids in
a way that the fluorescence signal remains high and that at the micron
scale, the vesicular structures are not altered by the dye insertion.
Optimum ratios are in the range of one dye molecule per 1400 lipids.
The vesicular resilience upon dye addition is evaluated on DPPC vesicles
using light scattering, zeta potential, and fluorescent microscopy.
With the above dye-to-lipid ratio, we ensure moreover that phenomena
such as aggregation-caused quenching do not occur and mitigate the
fluorescence intensity. As anticipated, we also found that separation
and centrifugation techniques usually necessary to remove the dye
excess are not required here. To demonstrate its versatility, the
protocol is applied to two other vesicular systems, a lipid drug administrated
to premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (Curosurf)
and a surfactant formulation used as a fabric conditioner. In Curosurf,
the vesicles are negatively charged, whereas in the surfactant formulation,
they are positively charged. Interestingly, the amounts of dye added
to optimize the fluorescence signals depend slightly on the system
or on the electrostatic charge, around 1 μM for a lipid or surfactant
solution at 1 g L–1. To complete this study, we
illustrate the benefits of this labeling method in evaluating the
internalization of silica nanoparticles in cells after their interactions
with Curosurf vesicles. With the fabric softener formulation, we also
investigate the deposition of surfactant on cotton fibers. In both
examples, we are able to visualize using fluorescence microscopy the
fate of the vesicles after their interactions with live cells or with
cotton. These results allow us to establish the interaction patterns
specific to each system and to assign the relevant nanoscale interaction
mechanisms thanks to fluorescence microscopy.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 PKH67 Fluorescent Dye
Developed for
live cells, PKH linkers are lipophilic molecules that incorporate
spontaneously into the lipid bilayer. Their photophysical properties
cover the visible and infrared emission spectrum and the molecules
are described as nontoxic effects toward cells.20,22,26 The 1 mM PKH67 solution in ethanol was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The molecule is made of two
fluorescent head groups and two aliphatic chains. Its chemical structure
as provided by the supplier is shown in Scheme 1. PKH67 fluoresces in the green, its excitation,
and emission wavelengths being at 410 and 502 nm, respectively. More
information can be found in the website in Supporting Information S5 and S7.

4.2 Phospholipids
and Surfactants
DPPC
(Scheme 2a) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. It is a phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid with a
gel-to-fluid phase-transition temperature of 41 °C.50 For vesicle preparation, DPPC was initially
dissolved in methanol at 10 g L–1. After a 30 min
solvent evaporation at low pressure and 60 °C, a lipid film was
formed on the glass surface. It was hydrated with the addition of
DI water at 60 °C and stirred at atmospheric pressure for another
30 min. DI water was added to obtain a 1 g L–1 dispersion.
In these conditions, DPPC was found to form uni- and multilamellar
vesicles.

Curosurf, also called poractant Alfa (Chiesi Pharmaceuticals,
Parma, Italy), is an extract of whole mince of porcine lung tissue
purified by column chromatography.33,51 It is indicated
for the rescue treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in premature
infants and administered intratracheally at a dose of 200 mg kg–1. Curosurf was kindly provided by Dr. Mostafa Mokhtari
and his team from the neonatal service at Hospital Kremlin-Bicêtre,
Val-de-Marne, France. Curosurf is produced as an 80 g L–1 phospholipid and protein suspension where the phospholipids are
assembled in the form of multilamellar anionic vesicles. It contains,
among others, PC lipids, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylglycerol (PG),
and the membrane proteins SP-B and SP-C.32,34,40,52 Some of the
lipids present in Curosurf are displayed in Scheme 2b (Supporting Information Table S1). According to the manufacturer, the pH of Curosurf is
adjusted with addition of sodium bicarbonate at pH 6.2.53 In the conditions used in this work, Curosurf
is organized in anionic vesicles with a large size distribution (50
nm to 2 μm), as shown by cryo-TEM.54 The gel-to-fluid transition of Curosurf membranes was measured and
found at TM = 29.5 °C (Supporting Information S8).

The esterquat
cationic surfactant ethanaminium, 2-hydroxy-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methyl-esters with
saturated and unsaturated C16–18 aliphatic
chains (Scheme 2c),
abbreviated as TEQ hereafter, was provided by Solvay. Its gel-to-fluid
phase-transition temperature is observed at 60 °C, and the counterions
associated with the quaternized amines are methyl sulfate anions.17 TEQ is a cationic surfactant widely used in
the industry as the main component of hair and fabric conditioners.
It forms unilamellar and multivesicular vesicles in water, as shown
by cryo-TEM in Supporting Information S2.17

4.3 Silica
Nanoparticles
The positively
charged silica particles were synthetized using the Stöber
synthesis.31,55 Briefly, fluorescent silica seeds
were prepared in three steps. The rhodamine derivative rhodamine red
c2 maleimide (Aldrich) was first covalently bound to silica precursor
(3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (MPS, Aldrich). The rhodamine–MPS
compound was then mixed with a tetraethyl orthosilicate silica precursor
(TEOS, Aldrich) and the Stöber synthesis was performed. With
this approach, the dyes were covalently bound to the silica matrix.
In a third step, a nonfluorescent silica shell was grown with TEOS
to increase the particle size and prevent leakage of the dyes out
of the particles. Functionalization by amine groups was then performed,
resulting in a positively charged coating.55 Aminated silica was synthesized at 40 g L–1 and
diluted with DI water at pH 5. The hydrodynamic and geometric diameters
were determined as DH = 60 nm and D0 = 41.2 nm, respectively. The fluorescence
properties were characterized using a Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (Agilent),
with leading excitation and emission peaks at 572 and 590 nm, respectively.
A particle identity card displaying UV–vis spectrometry, fluorimetry,
TEM, and light scattering data is provided in Supporting Information S9.

4.4 Cellulose
Fibers
Woven cotton fabric
(1 × 1 cm2) was used to investigate the softener surfactant
deposition onto fibers. The fabrics are made of cotton yarns of diameters
300 ± 100 μm, each of them being constituted of approximately
20 cotton fibers of diameter 10–20 μm. A representative
SEM image of the woven cotton fabric used in this work is provided
in Supporting Information S6. All fabrics
were first treated with DI water for 10 min and dried at 35 °C
under air circulation before use.

4.5 Vesicle
Labeling
The 1 mM commercial
PKH67 stock solution in ethanol was first diluted 10 times using pure
ethanol. The diluted stock (2 μL) was then mixed rapidly with
100 μL of DI water and vortexed for 10 s. It was then added
to 100 μL of a DPPC or Curosurf vesicle aqueous dispersion at
the concentration of 2 g L–1. The final dye concentration
was then 1 μM. Rapid vortexing for ca. 10 s was followed to
ensure the dye insertion in the lipid membranes. The dispersion was
let to rest in the dark for 10 min. For labeling TEQ vesicles, the
dye concentration used was six times larger than the previous one.
In particular, 2 μL of the PKH67 stock solution was rapidly
mixed with 100 μL of DI water and vortexed for ca. 10 s. This
solution was then added to 100 μL of a TEQ vesicle dispersion
at a concentration of 2 g L–1 and the mixture was
vortexed.

4.6 Sample Preparation
To evaluate the
PKH67 solubility, solutions were prepared at 5 μM in different
solvents, such as ethanol, PBS, Diluent C, and water. Diluent C is
a commercial product developed for cell labeling. It contains glycerol
(50%), Triton X100 (0.15 wt %), bovine serum albumin (200 mg L–1), dithiothreitol (1 mM), ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) (0.1 mM), NaCl (250 mM), and Tris–HCl (10 mM).
Pertaining to the vesicles, Curosurf, DPPC, and TEQ dispersions were
prepared at room temperature using DI water and a concentration of
2 g L–1. Before use, the dispersions were characterized
by dynamic light scattering and ζ-potential measurements. In
some cases, the dispersions were extruded through a polycarbonate
membrane following a protocol described in ref (34) to reduce the vesicle
size dispersity. To study the interaction of silica nanoparticles
with lipids, we use the method of continuous variation developed by
Job to determine the stoichiometry of binding (macro)molecular species
in solutions.56 The method is here combined
with static and dynamic light scattering, leading to Job scattering
plots.17,34,53,57 In brief, stock solutions (1 mL) were prepared in
the same conditions of pH and concentration (1 g L–1) and mixed at the volumetric ratios X = VLP/VNP = 2, where VLP and VNP are the
volumes of the surfactant and particle solutions. The particle and
lipid concentrations (0.66 and 0.33 g L–1, respectively)
correspond to identical surface area concentrations in membrane and
in silica.34

4.7 Deposition
of Labeled TEQ Vesicles on Cotton
Fabrics
PKH67 (10 μL) was dispersed in 1500 μL
of DI water and mixed rapidly with vortex. This mixture was then added
in 1500 μL of TEQ prepared at 1 g L–1 and
mixed rapidly with the vortex. Cotton fabric (0.03 g) cut in small
pieces was immersed for 10 min in this dispersion.

4.8 Cell Culture
Adenocarcinomic human
alveolar epithelial cells A549 (ATCC reference CCL-185) were grown
in T75-flasks in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Exponentially growing cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. When the cell confluence
reached 80%, cell cultures were passaged using trypsin–EDTA.
All products used in cell culture came from Gibco, Life Technologies.

4.9 Light Scattering
The scattering intensity IS and hydrodynamic diameter DH were measured using the Zetasizer NanoZS spectrometer
(Malvern Instruments, Worcestershore, UK). A 4 mW He–Ne laser
beam (λ = 633 nm) is used to illuminate the sample dispersion,
and the scattered intensity is collected at a scattering angle of
173°. The second-order autocorrelation function g(2)(t) is analyzed using the cumulant
and CONTIN algorithms to determine the average diffusion coefficient DC of the scatterers. The hydrodynamic diameter
is then calculated according to the Stokes–Einstein relation, DH = kBT/3πηDC, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature,
and η the solvent viscosity. Measurements were performed in
triplicate at 25 °C after an equilibration time of 120 s.

4.10 Zeta Potential
Laser Doppler velocimetry
(Zetasizer, Malvern Instruments, Worcestershore, UK) using the phase
analysis light scattering mode and a detection at an angle of 16°
was performed to determine the electrophoretic mobility and zeta potential
of the different studied dispersions. Measurements were performed
in triplicate at 25 °C, after 120 s of thermal equilibration.

4.11 Phase-Contrast and Fluorescence Optical Microscopy
Images were acquired on an IX73 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped
with a 60× objective. An Exi Blue camera (QImaging) and Metaview
software (Universal Imaging Inc.) were used as the acquisition system.
The illumination system “Illuminateur XCite Microscope”
produced a white light, filtered for observing a green signal in fluorescence
(excitation filter at 470 nm—bandwidth 40 nm and emission filter
at 525 nm—bandwidth 50 nm). Thirty microliters of the vesicle
dispersion (DPPC, Curosurf or TEQ) or nanoparticle/vesicle dispersions
(silica particles/Curosurf or nanocellulose/TEQ) were deposited on
a glass plate and sealed into a Gene Frame dual-adhesive system (Abgene/Advanced
Biotech). In the case of DPPC and Curosurf vesicles, the glass slides
were coated using a cationic polymer (PDADMAC) to improve their adhesion
properties based on electrostatic interaction. Images were digitized
and treated by the ImageJ software and plugins (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).

4.12 Confocal Microscopy
Images were
acquired on an LSM 710 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 40×
immersion objective and a temperature and carbon dioxide content controller.
The A549 cells (ATTC) were first seeded on a glass slide in a six-well
plate at 200 000 cells per well. After 48 h of growth in complete
white DMEM, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated 4 h at 37
°C with a silica/Curosurf dispersion. The concentrations are
0.1 g L–1 for the particles and 0.015 g L–1 for Curosurf in white DMEM. Cells were then fixed with PFA and nuclei
were stained in blue with DAPI. Finally, slides were sealed into a
Gene Frame dual-adhesive system (Abgene/Advanced Biotech). Images
were digitized and treated by the ImageJ software and plugins (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).

4.13 Absorbance and Fluorescence Measurements
A UV–visible spectrometer (SmartSpecPlus from BioRad) was
used to measure the absorbance of PKH67 aqueous dispersions at 0.05
and 2 μM. The fluorescence properties of PKH67 at 0.05 and 2
μM and of DPPC/PKH67 at 0.05 g L–1/0.05 μM
were characterized using a Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (Agilent) with
PMT at 860, 980, and 860, respectively.
