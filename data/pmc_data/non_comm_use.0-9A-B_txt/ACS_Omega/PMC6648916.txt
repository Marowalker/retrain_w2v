The detection of
partial discharge by analyzing the decomposition
components of SF6 gas in gas-insulated switchgears plays
an important role in the diagnosis and assessment of the operational
state of power equipment. Recently, the application of transition
metal-modified MoS2 monolayer dioxide in gas detection
has received wide attention. In this paper, first-principle density
functional theory calculations were adopted to study the gas-sensitive
response of Co-MoS2 monolayer to SOF2 and SO2F2. It is found that the conductivity of the Co-MoS2 monolayer has been effectively enhanced after Co atom doping
on the MoS2 monolayer. After gas adsorption, electrons
transfer from the Co-MoS2 monolayer to the gas molecules,
resulting in significant reduction of conductivity of the adsorption
system. The calculation results reveal that the Co-MoS2 monolayer is sensitive and selective to SOF2 and SO2F2 gases. This study provides the theoretical possibility
of using Co-MoS2 as a gas sensor for SOF2 and
SO2F2 gas detection.

1 Introduction
It is well known that
SF6 has excellent insulation and
arc extinguishing capability, which makes it a widely used insulating
medium using in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS).1,2 Because
of the critical role of SF6-insulated GIS in power systems,
its running stability is crucial for the entire power system. However,
partial discharge inevitably occurs when potential insulation faults
exist in GIS during the design, production, and long-term operation
process.3−5 Research showed that SF6 will decompose
into fluoride (SFx, x = 1–5) under strong energy of partial discharge. Then, the
unstable SFx will quickly react with trace
of H2O and O2 present in GIS to various decomposition
products, including the main components: SOF2 and SO2F2.6−8 These decomposition products can significantly accelerate
the corrosion of the insulation medium and further reduce the electrical
insulation strength of GIS.7−9 In addition, continuous partial
discharge may turn into flashover or destructive discharge and even
lead to sudden breakdown of GIS without timely handling.10,11 Therefore, detecting and analyzing the type and concentration of
SF6 decomposition products is of great significance for
diagnosing the type and damage degree of partial discharge. Thanks
to high sensitivity and fast response of gas sensors, it can be an
effective method to detect the SF6 decomposition products.12−14

In recent years, two dimensional-layered MoS2 nanomaterials
have attracted much attention because of its large specific surface
area, high surface activity, good thermal conductivity, and strong
chemical stability.15−17 The semiconductor properties and high specific surface
area of the MoS2 monolayer, makes it a promising material
for gas detection.18−20 Recently, studies showed that MoS2 monolayer
sensors can effectively detect NH3, NO2, H2, and other gases.21,22 However, because of
the limited gas sensing properties of intrinsic MoS2, surface
modification is usually adopted,23 such
as metallic and nonmetallic nanoparticles doping: Au, Pt, Ni, and
Si.24−26 Previous study results showed that surface modification
significantly improves the sensitivity and selectivity of MoS2-based materials to gas molecules.27−29 Liu et al.
found that Si-doped MoS2 has obvious sensing properties
for H2 at room temperature even at a low gas concentration
of 0.5%.30 According to previous studies,
Co is one of the most used doping atoms among transition metals, which
shows outstanding performance in enhancing the adsorption, gas sensitivity,
and catalytic ability of MoS2.31,32 In addition, Co doping on MoS2 is easy to be prepared,
which makes it to be widely used as an adsorbent and gas sensor.33,34 However, as far as we know, the Co-MoS2 monolayer has
not been reported for its application in SF6 decomposition
product detection.

In this study, the first-principles density
functional theory (DFT)
was used to study the gas sensing properties of Co-MoS2 to SOF2 and SO2F2 by analyzing
the adsorption structure, adsorption energy, charge transfer, density
of states (DOS), charge density difference (CDD), and molecular orbital.
The theoretical analysis explains the effect of Co doping on the response
performance of the MoS2 monolayer to SOF2 and
SO2F2. This study not only puts forward an application
of Co-MoS2 material in the SF6 decomposition
components detection but also provides a theoretical foundation for
the gas sensor design.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Simulation Structure of the Co-MoS2 Monolayer
The structure of Co-MoS2 is built
based on the perfect MoS2 monolayer. The most stable configuration
for the Co-MoS2 monolayer has been thoroughly studied. Figure 1 and Table 1 show the optimized geometry
and corresponding structural parameters of the most stable configuration
of the Co-MoS2 monolayer. The Co atom locates at the top
of the MoS2 monolayer protruding out of the MoS2 surface, which forms stable chemical bonds with three adjacent S
atoms labeled as S1, S2, and S3 with bond lengths of 2.114, 2.089,
and 2.114 Å, respectively. The structure of MoS2 away
from the Co doping site is almost unchanged after Co atom doping. Eads of Co-MoS2 is −0.325 eV,
and 0.144 e of electrons transfers from the Co atom to MoS2.

(a) top view; (b) side view.

system	dCo-S1/Å	dCo-S2/Å	dCo-S3/Å	QCo/e	ECo/eV	
Co-MoS2	2.114	2.089	2.114	0.144	–0.325	
To understand the adsorption
properties of the Co atom on the MoS2 monolayer, the total
DOS (TDOS) was analyzed as shown in Figure 2. For the TDOS, it
can be seen that the TDOS of the Co-MoS2 monolayer shifts
left after Co doping. Because of the contribution of Co doping, the
TDOS increases significantly around the Fermi level, signifying the
conductivity of the MoS2 improves. For the partial DOS
(PDOS), it is found that the change of TDOS is mainly contributed
by strong hybridization of the 3p orbital of the S atom and the 3d
orbital of the Co atom in the interval of −3 to −2 and
1 to 2 eV.

Figure 2 TDOS and PDOS of intrinsic MoS2 and Co-MoS2 monolayers: (a) TDOS; (b) PDOS.

The electron transfer behavior was analyzed based on the
molecular
orbital theory as shown in Figure 3. For the distribution of the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO),
the HOMO and LUMO are mainly located around the Co doping site, indicating
that Co doping benefits the electron transfer. Eg of the intrinsic MoS2 monolayer is 2.058 eV, and
it dramatically reduces to 0.387 eV for the Co-MoS2 monolayer.
Therefore, the electrons in the valence band are more likely to jump
and effectively improve the electrical conductivity of the intrinsic
MoS2 monolayer.

2.2 Adsorption
of SOF2 on the Co-MoS2 Monolayer
To
analyze the adsorption performance
of the Co-MoS2 monolayer to the target SOF2 molecule,
a large number of potential structures have been built and optimized
to obtain the most stable adsorption structure. Two typical adsorption
structures, labeled as P1 and P2, are obtained as shown in Figure 4. Its corresponding
adsorption parameters are presented in Table 2.

Figure 4 Adsorption structures of SOF2-adsorbed
Co-MoS2 monolayer: (a) P1 structure; (b) P2 structure.

Table 2 Adsorption Parameters
of the SOF2-Adsorbed Co-MoS2 Monolayer by P1
and P2, Respectively
position	Eads/eV	Q/e	Eg/eV	d/Å	
P1	–1.468	–0.026	0.330	Co–S 2.043	
P2	–1.765	–0.491	0.800	Co–F 1.842	
 	 	 	 	Co–S 2.187	
For the P1 structure given in Figure 4a, though the SOF2 molecule has
not directly bonded to the surface of the Co-MoS2 monolayer, Eads still reaches −1.468 eV during the
adsorption process, which means that the adsorption structure is relatively
stable. The distance from the S atom of SOF2 to the Co
atom is 2.043 Å, and −0.026 e transfers from Co-MoS2 to SOF2. Because of the strong adsorption energy
between the SOF2 molecule and Co-MoS2, its interaction
belongs to chemical adsorption. By comparing Eg before and after gas molecule adsorption, Eg has only decreased 0.057 eV, indicating that the conductivity
of the Co-MoS2 system is almost unchanged before and after
adsorption.

For the P2 structure given in Figure 4b, it is found that one S–F bond in
SOF2 breaks and interacts with the Co atom of Co-MoS2 by forming Co–S and Co–F bonds upon SOF2 adsorption. The bond lengths of Co–S and Co–F
are 2.187 and 1.842 Å, respectively. The charge transfer from
Co-MoS2 to the SOF2 molecule is −0.491
e based on the Milliken population results. In addition, Co-MoS2 shows strong interaction with SOF2 with an Eads of −1.765 eV, which is significantly
larger than that in the P1 structure. Comparing with Eg (0.387 eV) of Co-MoS2, it increases to 0.800
eV after SOF2 molecule adsorption, indicating that SOF2 adsorption leads to the conductivity of the Co-MoS2 system.

To understand the electronic behavior and analyze
the gas sensitivity
of Co-MoS2 to SOF2, the TDOS, PDOS, and CDD
were further analyzed. Because of the main contribution of the outmost
orbitals of the interacted atom in the adsorption process, only the
F 2p, S 3p, and Co 3d orbitals were discussed in the PDOS, as seen
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 TDOS and PDOS
of the SOF2-adsorbed Co-MoS2 monolayer: (a)
TDOS; (b) PDOS.

As shown in Figure 5a, the TDOS slightly
moves to the right side, and the TDOS near the
Fermi level drops between 0 and 1 eV after SOF2 adsorption,
indicating a reduction in the conductivity of Co-MoS2-based
material. According to the distribution of PDOS in Figure 5b, this change of TDOS is mainly
because of the obvious hybridization of the S 3p orbital of SOF2 and the Co 3d orbital in the range of −6 to −4
eV and the hybridization of the F 2p orbital with Co 3d from −2
to −1 eV. The analysis of TDOS and PDOS confirms that it is
a strong interaction between SOF2 and Co-MoS2 monolayers.

To further analyze the change of the electron
distribution, the
CDD of the P2 structure was studied as shown in Figure 6, where the acquisition and loss of electrons
are represented by red and blue, respectively. It can be seen that
two F atoms of SOF2 get a large number of electrons. According
to the results of Mulliken population analysis, the obtained quantity
of electrons by two F atoms reaches −0.780 e. On the contrary,
Co and Mo atoms lose during gas adsorption. Therefore, it further
verifies that the conductivity of the Co-MoS2 monolayer
decreases after SOF2 adsorption.

2.3 Adsorption of SO2F2 on
the Co-MoS2 Monolayer
In order to obtain the most
stable adsorption structure of SO2F2-adsorbed
Co-MoS2, single SO2F2 was set to
approach the surface of the Co-MoS2 monolayer from different
initial approaches sites. After geometry optimization, two typical
adsorption structures were obtained as shown in Figure 7, labeled as P1 and P2. Table 3 shows Eads, Q, and Eg of SO2F2-adsorbed Co-MoS2 by P1
and P2.

Figure 7 Adsorption structures of the SO2F2-adsorbed
Co-MoS2 monolayer by P1 and P2: (a) P1 side view; (b) P1
top view; (c) P2 side view; and (d) P2 top view.

Table 3 Adsorption Parameters of the SO2F2-Adsorbed Co-MoS2 Monolayer by P1
and P2, Respectively
structure	Eads/eV	Q/e	Eg/eV	d/Å	
P1	–0.881	–0.636	0.540	Co–F1 1.841	
P2	–2.390	–1.062	1.040	Co–F1 1.798	
 	 	 	 	Co–F2 1.864	
For the P1 structure shown in Figure 7a, it can be seen
that one S–F bond
of SO2F2 breaks during the adsorption process.
The dissociated F atom builds a bond with the Co atom with a bond
length of 1.841 Å, and the dissociated SO2F gas keeps
away from the surface of Co-MoS2. SO2F2 gas gets −0.636 e from Co-MoS2, and the adsorption
process releases 0.881 eV. Because of the obvious charge transfer
and strong adsorption energy, Co-MoS2 adsorbs on the surface
of Co-MoS2 by a stable structure. Eg of SO2F2-adsorbed Co-MoS2 is 0.540 eV, which is distinctly larger than that of Co-MoS2 (0.387 eV). As a result, SO2F2 adsorption
leads to the decrease of conductivity.

For the P2 structure
shown in Figure 7b,
it is found that both of the F atoms dissociate
from SO2F2 and form two stable Co–F bonds
by lengths of 1.798, 1.864 Å, respectively. The dissociated SO2 was away from the surface of Co-MoS2. In the process,
a large amount of electrons transfer from the Co-MoS2 monolayer
to SO2F2. Meanwhile, Eads of the P2 structure is up to −2.390 eV, exhibiting
it as a strong interaction. Moreover, Eg increases sharply from 0.387 to 1.040 eV after adsorption. We conclude
that P2 is the most stable adsorption structure by comparing the adsorption
property of Co-MoS2 to SO2F2 in P1
and P2 structures.

To further analyze the adsorption behavior
of SO2F2 gas on the Co-MoS2 monolayer,
the TDOS, PDOS were
also discussed as shown in Figure 8. After SO2F2 adsorption, the
TDOS is apparently shifted to the right side, signifying that the
energy level of the electron filling increases, which is favorable
for the free movement of electrons. The TDOS increases between −1
and 0 eV, but decreases to zero in the range of 0.3–1 eV. According
to the distribution of PDOS, its can be found that the change of TDOS
is mainly owing to the orbital hybridization of the F 2p orbital and
the S 3p orbital of Co-MoS2 in the range of −4.8
to −3.5 and −2 to −1.5 eV. In addition, the Co
3d orbital hybrids with F 2p range from −1.5 to 0.8 eV.

Figure 8 TDOS and PDOS
of SO2F2 adsorbed on the Co-MoS2 monolayer:
(a) TDOS; (b) PDOS.

The CDD of the P2 structure
is shown in Figure 9, where red and blue represent acquisition
and loss of electrons, respectively. During the strong chemical interaction
between SO2F2 and Co-MoS2, the O
atoms and the F atoms of the SO2F2 molecule
receive a large amount of electrons, and the electron density surrounding
the S atom of SO2F2 decreases. Milliken population
analysis shows that the F atom and O atom receive 0.947 and 0.608
e of electrons, respectively, while the S atom loses 0.493 e of electrons.
In general, SO2F2 acts as an electron acceptor
during the adsorption process.

2.4 Comparison
of SOF2 and SO2F2 Adsorbed on the
Co-MoS2 Monolayer
The adsorption properties of
the Co-MoS2 monolayer to
SOF2 and SO2F2 gases are compared
below. For adsorption structures, SOF2 was completely bonded
onto the surface of Co-MoS2 by a stable chemical bond while
two F atoms of SO2F2 break away from the gas
molecule and builds a new bond with the Co atom, and the dissociated
SO2 gas adsorbs on the surface of MoS2 by weak
interaction. Because of the strong electronegativity of the F atom,
SO2F2 receives more electrons from the Co-MoS2 during the adsorption process. In addition, the redistribution
of electrons leads to change of the DOS. The DOS shows different change
rules for different gas molecules adsorption, indicating that the
adsorption of these two types of gases causes a difference change
in the conductivity of Co-MoS2. It builds up the theoretical
basis for gas sensors to sensitively detect different gases. Generally,
Co-MoS2 shows a better gas sensing property to SO2F2 than SOF2.

3 Conclusions
In this study, Co-MoS2 has been proposed as the gas-sensing
material to adsorb the characteristic decomposition components of
SF6 under partial electric discharge: SOF2 and
SO2F2. The adsorption energy, charge transfer,
energy gap, and CDD of all potential adsorption structures were calculated
to analyze the adsorption mechanism based on the density functional
theory. Following are the conclusions:1 The doped Co atom builds a stable adsorption
structure with MoS2 by interacting with three adjacent
S atoms. Because of the strong chemical activity of the Co atom, the
DOS near the Fermi level become continuous after Co doping, and the
conductivity of the Co-MoS2 monolayer is greatly improved
comparing with intrinsic MoS2.

2 SOF2 and SO2F2 adsorb on the Co doping site of Co-MoS2 by chemical
adsorption. The gas molecules act as electron acceptors, and the Co-MoS2 monolayer plays electron donors role in the adsorption process.
Co-MoS2 possesses different degrees of change in the electrical
conductivity to different gas molecules adsorption. As a result, Co-MoS2-based material is sensitive to SOF2 and SO2F2, which builds up the theoretical basis for gas
sensors to sensitively detect different gases.



4 Computational Details and Methods
All calculations
were calculated based on the DFT with Tkatchenko–Scheffler
dispersion correction. An MoS2 monolayer was built with
a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell, including 32 S atoms and 16 Mo atoms,
which is large enough to explore its adsorption to monomolecular gases.35,36 In addition, a vacuum thickness of 15 Å was set to avoid the
interaction between different layers.37 The exchange and correlation energy were calculated by the general
gradient approximate with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof,
which has been widely used in DFT calculations.38−41 The self-consistent field (SCF)
approximation was calculated by double numerical basis set plus polarization
functions (DNP).42,43 The Brillouin zone k-point sampling was sampled by 5 × 5 × 1.44 All of the optimized structures have an energy accuracy
of 2 × 10–5 Ha, and a maximum force of 4 ×
10–3 Ha/Å.45 The
SCF convergence accuracy was set to 1 × 10–6 Ha. In addition, the DIIS size was set to 6 to speed up the convergence
of SCF.

The adsorption energy of Co on the MoS2 monolayer
is
defined by eq 1, where ECo-MoS2, EMoS2, and Eco are
the total energy of Co-MoS2, MoS2, and Co, respectively.
The adsorption energy of the Co-MoS2 monolayer to gas molecules
is defined by eq 2.46ECo-MoS2/gas, ECo-MoS2, and Egas represent the total energy
of the Co-MoS2 monolayer after gas molecules adsorption,
the Co-MoS2 monolayer, and the free gas molecules before
adsorption, respectively. 1   2  

The charge transfer Q during gas adsorption was
calculated using the Mulliken population analysis obtained by eq 3, where Qiso and Qads are the carried
charge of gas molecules (or Co atom) before and after adsorption. Q > 0 means that electrons transfer from gas molecules
to
the surface of the Co-MoS2 monolayer. 3  

The energy gap of the molecular orbital
was calculated through
the energy levels of the HOMO and the LUMO, as defined in eq 4. It determines the probability
of charge movement in the adsorption system composed of the gas molecules
and the Co-MoS2 monolayer. The wider the gap is, the more
energy is required for electrons transferring from the valence band
to the conduction band. 4
