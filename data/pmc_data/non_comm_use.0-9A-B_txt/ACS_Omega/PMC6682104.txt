The adsorption ability
of porous carbons toward contaminants is
closely related to the porous structures and the working functional
groups. In this aspect, two porous carbons, with the potential use
as adsorbents for CO2 and iodine, were prepared from polycyclotrimerizations
(PCTs) of flexible bisphenyl A dicyanate (BPAC) and rigid binaphthalenyl
dicyanate (BNC) cyanate ester monomers. Primarily, PCT reactions of
BPAC and BNC generated the respective nonporous c-BPAC and c-BNC precursors,
which contain high amounts of nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms. Further
KOH activations of c-BPAC and c-BNC produced the respective porous
a-BPAC and a-BNC carbons, which mainly contain oxygen heteroatoms.
The a-BNC derived from rigid BNC contains both micro- and mesopores
and is high in adsorbing both CO2 (6.3 mmol/g) and iodine;
in contrast, the microporous a-BPAC is lower in adsorbing CO2 (3.9 mmol/g) and iodine. The effects of molecular flexibility of
the starting cyanate ester on the micro- and mesopore distribution
as well as the CO2 and iodine adsorption behaviors of the
porous carbons are therefore probed in this study.

Introduction
The immense scientific
and commercial value of porous organic polymers
is illustrated by their ubiquity as key materials in several potential
application fields, such as heterogeneous catalysis,1,2 sensors,3 organic electronics,4 and gas storage5,6 and separation.7,8 The interconnected porous structures endowed the polymers with the
capability of an accommodating guest molecule and meanwhile, tailored
modifications through inherent functional groups, which offered porous
carbons the specific binding sites for targeted recognition. Among
various family members9−19 of porous organic polymers, nitrogen-doped porous carbons (NPCs)20,21 have been under considerable research studies for the past three
decades ever since the finding that the basic nitrogen heteroatoms22 can interreact strongly with the acidic CO2 gas to result in the enhanced adsorption capacity.

Radioiodine (129I and 131I) has been identified
as one of the most hazardous species in terms of detrimental radiological
effects on health and environment in the case of accidental release.
Previously, several porous polymers23−36 with a microporous structure had been developed and demonstrated
as efficient absorbents for iodine. Among them, a charged porous aromatic
polymer25 was shown to exhibit an excellent
uptake of 2760 mg/g, as one of the highest values reported to date,
due to the high affinity of its inherent ionic bond, phenyl ring,
and triple bond toward iodine. Moreover, two NPCs37,38 also were characterized to be good adsorbents for iodine in view
that the beneficial polar interaction between nitrogen-containing
functional groups and iodine.

Mesoporous carbons with a pore
size in between 2 and 50 nm are
of great interest regarding their potential application in adsorbing
large organic molecules; in contrast, microporous carbons with an
enlarged specific surface area are more suitable for the adsorption
of volatile organic molecules, hydrogen storage, and CO2 capture. In this aspect, micropores39−41 are crucial for maximizing
CO2 uptake at ambient conditions, and microporous carbons42 with small (< 0.8 nm) and large micropores,
by activation of the polymeric materials with KOH, were reported to
adsorb CO2 with high capacity (4.6 mmol/g) at 23 °C.
The combination of meso- and micropores is nevertheless necessary
for some applications in considering that mesopores can be beneficial
in transporting and accommodating larger adsorbate molecules, whereas
micropores are essential for adsorption of small molecules. In this
regard, KOH activation43 was employed to
develop microporosity and to increase the surface area of mesoporous
carbons. Therefore, micro- and mesoporous carbons44,45 having the specific surface area, total pore volume, and volumes
of micropores and mesopores were synthesized, using different phenolic
molecules and formaldehyde as precursors, through carbonization and
the high-temperature KOH activation process.

The polycyclotrimerization
(PCT)46 reaction
of aromatic cyanate esters is unique in considering that the reaction
brings three cyanate (−OCN) groups together to form a one-sixth-electron s-triazine ring as a cross-linking point in the resulting
cross-linked network of polycyanurates (PCs). In the presence of small-mass
porogens or polymeric templates, a variety of porous PCs47−69 with the desired pore sizes had been prepared and identified as
adsorbents for CO2. PCT of bisphenol E dicyanate in the
presence of inert porogen45 afforded mesoporous
PCs after carbonization at elevated temperature. Meso- and macroporous
PC networks48−51 also were fabricated through copolymerization of cyanate esters
with different soft block copolymer templates, which can be hydrolytically
and thermally removed afterward. More recently, microporous PCs52−55 with pore sizes less than 2 nm were successfully prepared through
the uses of specially designed rigid cyanate ester. Thus, the first
microporous PC54 with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area (SBET) over 530 m2/g was constructed from tetrafunctional tetrakis(4-cyanatophenyl)silane
cyanate ester through high-temperature solution condensation. To implement
this design strategy, two micro- and macroporous PCs with tetrahedral
and triangular pyramidal shapes55,56 were synthesized. Moreover,
the use of ionic liquid porogens70 during
PCTs resulted in porous carbons with pore sizes in between 20 and
180 nm. As the member of NPC family, porous PCs are promising materials
for CO2 capture in considering the favorable dipole–quadrupole
interaction71−74 between nitrogen and CO2 molecules.

As indicated
above, previous efforts47−69 in the preparations of PC-based porous carbons always used porogens
for the creation of porous structures during the thermal curing stage.
To avoid the potential complications arising from the porogens, we
thus attempted to prepare PC-based porous carbons without porogens.
In this work, flexible bisphenyl A dicyanate (BPAC) and rigid binaphthalenyl
dicyanate (BNC) (Scheme 1) were cured through PCTs to generate the cured c-BPAC and c-BNC
as precursors to afford the respective a-BPAC and a-BNC porous carbons,
through carbonization and KOH activation. Without the use of porogens
during PCT, c-BPAC and c-BNC are nonporous materials with both nitrogen
and oxygen heteroatoms. In contrast, the KOH-activated a-BPAC and
a-BNC are porous carbons with micro- and mesoporous structures and
a high fraction of oxygen heteroatoms. For a-BNC, the inherent mesoporous
structures make it an excellent adsorbent for CO2 (6.3
mmol/g) and iodine (489.05 mg/g) while the low mesopore content of
a-BPAC resulted in its lower adsorption capacities toward CO2 (3.9 mmol/g) and iodine (331.33 mg/g). We reasoned that molecular
flexibility of the starting BPAC and BNC cyanate esters affects the
porous structure of the resulting a-BPAC and a-BNC, which constituted
the main focus of this study. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis (EA) confirmed
the chemical structures of the cyanate esters. Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to investigate the
thermal curing behavior of the cyanate esters. The micro- and mesoporous
structures, surface areas, and CO2 and iodine adsorption
behaviors of the activated porous carbons were investigated using
the BET method, Raman and UV–vis spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS).

Products
Results and Discussion
The starting cyanate ester of BPAC (or BNC) was prepared from the
substitution reaction between BPA (or BN) and BrCN (Scheme 1) in the presence of triethyl
amine as the acid scavenger. To eliminate spurious impurities, the
crude products of BPAC and BNC were needed to be purified by recrystallization
from cyclohexane. Chemical structures of BPAC and BNC were identified
by 1H NMR (Figure S1), FTIR
(Figure S2), and EA.

Primarily, BPAC
and BNC were subjected to cumulative thermal curing
at each designated temperature for 2 h, forming cross-linked PCs of
c-BPAC and c-BNC, respectively. The thermal curing behavior of BPAC
and BNC can be successfully identified by DSC and FTIR spectra (Figure 1). The DSC scan of
pure BPAC (Figure 1a) resulted in a broad curing exotherm in the temperature range from
210 to 345 °C with a curing enthalpy of 304 kJ/mol. The curing
enthalpy of BPAC decreased as the curing temperature increased from
150 to 215 °C, and eventually, the exothermic peak completely
disappeared for BPAC after the final curing stage at 290 °C,
which suggested that the curing reaction of BPAC was completed by
the cumulative curing process. FTIR spectra (Figure 1c), recorded after 2 h of heating at each
designated temperature, also correlate with the DSC results. By the
cumulative curing process, the −OCN stretching peak at 2258
cm–1 gradually disappeared, and at the same time,
the characteristic absorption peaks of the s-triazine
ring at 1568 and 1369 cm–1 gained their intensities
along the curing process. In contrast, the DSC thermogram of BNC is
not so informative as that of BPAC because its curing exotherm (Figure 1b) was partially
overlapped with the melting endotherm to result in lowering the curing
enthalpy (114 kJ/mol). Despite the inconclusive DSC results, the corresponding
FTIR spectra (Figure 1d) can be used to demonstrate the success of the curing reaction.
After the final curing stage at 240 °C, the FTIR spectrum exhibited
the characteristic absorption of the s-triazine ring
at 1560 and 1365 cm–1 and no sign of the cyanate
−OCN stretching peak at 2224 cm–1.

of (a) BPAC and (b) BNC (heating rate = 10 °C/min)
and FTIR spectra of (c) BPAC and (d) BNC after cumulative heating
at different curing temperatures for 2 h.

The Raman spectra of a-PBAC and a-BNC (Figure 6a) contain two strong peaks of a D-band at
1350 cm–1 and a G-band at 1595 cm–1. The D-band is typically originated from the disorder and imperfect
structures in the turbostratic carbon layers, whereas the G-band is
due to vibrations of in-plane displaced carbon atoms in the graphite
crystallites. The intensity ratio between the D and G bands75,76 provides information regarding the degree of graphitization of the
carbon materials. The higher one is the ID/IG ratio, and the lower one is the degree
of graphitization. With a lower ID/IG value (0.96), a-BNC should also be higher
in the degree of graphitization than a-BPAC with a higher ID/IG value (1.05).
X-ray diffraction spectra of a-BPAC and a-BNC (Figure S6b) resembled to each other with both exhibit two
broad, diffuse bands at 2θ = ∼24° and 43°.
These two bands are typical of a well-developed graphitic structure
that the stacking peak at 24° corresponds to the (002) plane
of graphite while the peak at 43° is due to the (100) plane of
graphite.77 Results from Raman and XRD
spectra indicate the graphitic nature of the porous a-BNC and a-BPAC.

Without the participation of porogen during PCT reactions, the
cured c-BPAC and c-BNC are essentially nonporous materials (Figure S7a) with low capture capacity toward
CO2 (<0.6 mmol/g at 25 °C, Figure S7b). In contrast, KOH activation of the cured PCs
resulted in porous a-BPAC and a-BNC, which own superior capture capability
(>3.9 mmol/g at 25 °C) and varied heteroatom contents. Heteroatom
contents of the cured and porous carbons were evaluated from EA (Table 1). Before KOH activation,
nitrogen contents (7.61– 10.07 wt %) of c-BPAC and c-BNC are
only slightly lower than the oxygen contents (11.49–13.29 wt
%), but after KOH activation, the resulting a-BPAC and a-BNC own high
oxygen (28.53–30.09 wt %) but low (1.93–3.13 wt %) contents.
The low nitrogen content in the porous carbons can also be verified
by XPS spectra.

Activated Products

The XPS spectra (Figure 2) of the cured and
activated products revealed three major
peaks due to the C 1s (at 284 eV), N 1s (at 399 eV), and O 1s (at
532 eV) photoelectrons. For a-BPAC and a-BNC, the tiny N 1s peaks
are consistent with the above EA results (Table 1) that nitrogen contents of a-BPAC and a-BNC
are much lower than those of the cured c-BPAC and c-BNC, respectively.
Previous study78,79 on various PCs (including c-BPAC)
concluded that thermal decompositions of PCs begin with hydrocarbon
chain scission and the accompanied cross-linking reaction, followed
by decyclization of the s-triazine ring, which liberates
volatile cyanuric acid and the corresponding phenyl esters. During
the present high-temperature KOH activation, decomposition of the
cured PCs should proceed with both thermal and chemical pathways in
which the thermally induced liberation of volatile cyanuric acid is
responsible for lowering the nitrogen content while the chemical agent
KOH acted to oxidize the graphitized carbons to result in large gain
of oxygen heteroatoms in the activated carbons.

Figure 2 XPS of the cured and
activated products.

Optimum curve fitting
of the C 1s and O 1s peaks (Figures S3 and S4) was conducted to identify the functional
groups present in the activated carbons (Table 2). From the deconvoluted O 1s spectra, we
concluded that quinone (531.3 eV), C=O (532.3 eV), C–O
(533.3 eV), C–OH (534.2 eV),80−82 and adsorbed H2O (535.9 eV) are all present over the surface of the activated carbons.
Most notably, a-BNC contains 17.04% of the quinone group, which is
essentially absent in a-BPAC. The quinone group of a-BNC may preferably
interreact with acidic CO2 to result in its superior CO2 adsorption character.

Nitrogen
sorption analysis was conducted at −195 °C
to resolve the sorption isotherms (Figure 3a) of the activated carbons. The sorption
isotherm of a-BPAC (Figure 3a) exhibited a steeper rise of nitrogen uptake, beginning
at the low relative pressure range of P/P0 < 0.01, than the sorption isotherm of a-BNC, which
may be due to a higher micropore content of a-BPAC compared to a-BNC.
Anyway, unambiguous determination can be obtained from CO2 sorption at −78 °C (inset, Figure 3b). The porous parameters, including the
BET surface area (SBET) and total pore
volume (Vtotal), calculated from the nitrogen
isotherms indicated that a-BPAC owns higher values of SBET and Vtotal compared to
those of a-BNC (SBET, 1136.5 m2/g vs 1080.2 m2/g; Vtotal,
0.58 cm3/g vs 0.51 cm3/g). The pore size distribution
(Figure 3b) evaluated
from nitrogen sorption at −195 °C was combined with the
results from CO2 sorption at −78 °C (inset, Figure 3b) with the purpose
of evaluating the structural difference between a-BNC and a-BPAC.
The most noticeable observation in Figure 3b is that a-BNC contains both micropores
and well-defined mesopores, with pore sizes of 7.3 and 11.7 nm, respectively,
whereas a-BPAC contains a large fraction of micropores, which resulted
in its high Vtotal value.

isotherms recorded at −195
°C and (b) mesopore (determined from N2 sorption at
−195 °C) and micropore (inset, determined from CO2 sorption at −78 °C) size distributions of a-BPAC
and a-BNC.

The CO2 capture behaviors
of the cured (Figure S7b) and activated
products (Figure 4)
were measured up
to 1.0 atm at 25 °C. The cured c-BPAC and c-BNC are nonporous
materials, and thus, they are inferior in CO2 capture (<0.6
mmol/g) to the porous a-BPAC and a-BNC. The CO2 capture
capability of a-BNC is extremely high at 6.3 mmol/g, which is higher
than most of the reported values. Even for the less efficient a-BPAC,
the resolved CO2 capture is still high at 3.9 mmol/g. In
considering the beneficial parameters of SBET and Vtotal, a-BPAC should be superior
in CO2 capture to a-BNC. Nevertheless, the CO2 capture capability of a-BPAC is dramatically behind a-BNC (6.3 mmol/g
vs 3.9 mmol/g). Accordingly, we suggested that pore size distribution
is the key factor controlling the CO2 capture ability.
In contrast to the predominant microporous a-BPAC, a-BNC contains
both micropores and mesopores. The large mesopores present in a-BNC
are therefore responsible for the efficient adsorption of CO2 gas, rendering an excellent CO2 capture value of 6.3
mmol/g.

Figure 4 CO2 capture using a-BNC and a-BPAC samples (at 25 °C
and 1 atm).

Presumably, the micro-
and mesopore formations of the activated
carbons are closely related to thermal stability of the PC precursors.
Previous study83 concluded that micropores
are more stable and more sustainable to high-temperature treatment
compared to mesopores. Therefore, more stable PCs are more sustainable
to the high-temperature KOH activation process, which should generate
stable microporous carbons, whereas less stable PCs tend to form less
stable mesoporous carbons after KOH activation. TGA analyses (Figure 5) provided valuable
information regarding thermal stabilities of the cured and activated
products. As judged from the on-set decomposition temperature and
the residual char yield at 800 °C, the cured c-BPAC is much more
stable than the cured c-BNC. After KOH activation, this stable c-BPAC
tends to form microporous a-BPAC, whereas the less stable c-BNC results
in porous a-BNC containing both meso- and microporous structures.

Figure 5 TGA thermograms
of the cured and activated products.

Disregarding the potential influence of the chemical structure,
a densely packed cross-linked network should be regarded as the more
stable structure compared with the loosely packed cross-linked network.
In this aspect, we attempted to assess the preformed c-BPAC and c-BNC
network structures by computer simulations using Materials Studio
software. The models were constructed by connecting s-triazine rings with three neighboring bisphenyl A or three binaphthalenyl
substituents without considering the mutual penetration of the networks.
After successive geometry and molecular mechanic optimizations, the
energy-minimized structures of the preformed c-BPAC and c-BNC networks
are presented in Figure 6a,b, respectively. In the case of c-BPAC,
it takes four monomeric subunits to form a cycle with a size of ∼1.97
nm, but for c-BNC, a larger cycle with a size of ∼7.42 nm and
19 monomeric subunits was resolved. The results suggested that the
simulated preformed structure of c-BPAC is a densely packed preformed
network consisting of 27 monomeric subunits within a unit cell of a = 5 nm, b = 5 nm, and c = 5 nm, whereas the simulated c-BNC structure contains a loosely
packed network consisting of 63 monomeric subunits within a larger
unit cell of a = 10 nm, b = 10 nm,
and c = 10 nm. The distinctive network structures
of c-BNC and c-BPAC are associated with the molecular flexibility
of starting cyanate esters used to construct the network. When connect
with each other to form a cycle, the rigid BNC monomers can only adopt
minute adjustment on their molecular orientation, which takes more
monomeric subunits to construct the cyclic building motifs of the
loosely packed c-BNC network. In contrast, the flexible BPACs can
take a higher degree of molecular adjustment, thus taking less monomeric
subunits to form a small cycle in the densely packed c-BPAC network.
In consequence, molecular flexibility of the cyanate esters directly
affects packing density and thermal stability of the cured PCs, which
in turn determines the porous structures formed in the KOH-activated
porous carbons.

within
a unit cell of a = 5 nm, b = 5 nm,
and c = 5 nm and (b) c-BNC within a unit cell of a = 10 nm, b = 10 nm, and c = 10 nm.

Iodine Adsorption of a-BNC and a-BPAC
The iodine adsorption was measured by using porous adsorbents (30
mg) immersed in different amounts (3 and 10 mL) of iodine solution
in hexane (2 mg/mL). When iodine was dissolved in the nonpolar hexane
solvent, the solution became violet in color (Figure 7a), but further treatment of a-BNC turned
the solution into colorless, which indicated that iodine in the solution
had been consumed by the a-BNC adsorbent. A quantitative view can
be obtained from tracing the UV–vis absorption peak of iodine
at 523 nm (Figure 7b). The absorbance of the peak at 523 nm decreased significantly
within the initial 1/2 h, which correlated with the efficient iodine
adsorption by a-BNC. Actually, removal efficiencies of a-BNC and a-BPAC
(Figure 7c) reached
their maxima within the initial 2 h, and after that, the removal efficiencies
remained at constant values for the rest of the experimental period.
Removal efficiency of the high iodine-loaded (10 mL) solution is lower
than that of the low iodine-loaded solution (3 mL). Overall, a-BNC
is a better adsorbent for iodine than a-BPAC (Figure 7d) in considering that a-BNC is higher in
maximum adsorption capability with a value of 489.05 mg/g than a value
of 331.33 mg/g for a-BPAC. The large mesopores of a-BNC are suggested
to be more efficient in accommodating iodine molecules than the small
micropores of a-BPAC, which resulted in the higher iodine adsorption
capacity of a-BNC compared to a-BPAC.

Conclusions
Porous carbons of a-BPAC
and a-BNC, as efficient adsorbents for
CO2 and iodine, were prepared from PCTs of the flexible
BPAC and the rigid BNC, respectively, through carbonization and KOH
activation. PCTs of BPAC and BNC can be driven to complete by a cumulative
heating process according to the results from DSC and FTIR analyses.

The KOH-activated a-BPAC and a-BNC have their functional groups
and porous structures essentially different from the c-BPAC and c-BNC
precursors. KOH activation converted the nonporous PC precursors into
porous carbons with a high oxygen content. Both a-BPAC and a-BNC exhibit
high SBET (1136.5 m2/g for
a-BPAC and 1080.2 m2/g for a-BNC) and Vtotal (0.58 cm3/g for a-BPAC and 0.51 cm3/g for a-BNC). Owing to the inherent mesoporous structure,
a-BNC exhibits excellent adsorption ability (6.3 mmol/g) to CO2, which is comparatively higher than that (3.9 mmol/g) of
the microporous a-BPAC. The mesopores in a-BNC also make a-BNC superior
in an iodine adsorbent to the microporous a-BPAC. The influence of
molecular flexibility of the starting cyanate ester on the micro-
and mesopore distribution, and CO2 and iodine adsorption
behaviors of the porous carbons were therefore assessed in this study.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Bisphenol A (BPA), 1,1-bi-2-naphthol (BN),
phenol, formaldehyde, oxalic acid catalyst, cyanogen bromide (BrCN),
and iodine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical and were used
directly. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was refluxed over sodium and benzophenone
under a nitrogen atmosphere for more than 2 days before distillation
use. Triethylamine was distilled from CaH2 under a nitrogen
atmosphere before use.

Synthesis of BPAC and BNC
Synthesis
of BPAC and BNC
followed the same procedures,84,85 and the selected synthesis
of BPAC was detailed as follows: the solution of BrCN (1.39 g, 13.14
mmol) in THF (2 mL) was slowly added dropwise into the solution of
BPA (1 g, 4.38 mmole) in THF (16 mL) at ice-water temperature under
a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixtures were then cooled to −30
°C, and freshly distilled triethylamine (1.83 mL, 13.14 mmol)
was added dropwise into the vigorously stirred mixtures. The reaction
was continued for 2 h; after that, the white salt was filtered, and
500 mL of ice water was added to precipitate the crude product. The
whole resultant solution mixtures were then stayed in the ice water
for 3 h to allow decomposition of the unreacted BrCN. The solid precipitate
was collected and dried in a vacuum oven before recrystallization
from cyclohexane to obtain the final product (1.036 g, 85%). BPAC: 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ):

Preparation of Cured c-BPAC and c-BNC
Thermal PCT reactions
of BPAC and BNC were carried out by cumulative heating at each of
the designated temperatures for a period of 2 h. The designated temperatures
are 150, 215, and 290 °C for BPAC and are 140, 175, and 240 °C
for BNC.

Synthesis of Activated Carbons: a-BPAC and a-BNC
Carbonizations
of a-BPAC and a-BNC were carried out using c-BPAC and c-BNC, respectively,
as starting PC precursors to work with. The c-BPAC and c-BNC precursors
were mixed with aqueous KOH solution (200 g/L) with a weight ratio
of 1–4, and the whole solution mixtures were further stirred
at room temperature overnight. The resulting solution mixtures were
then distilled to remove the solvent, and the brown residue was dried
in vacuum at 70 °C for 24 h. Carbonization of the c-BPAC/KOH
and c-BNC/KOH mixtures was carried out in a nickel crucible placed
within a tube furnace by heating the mixtures to the target temperatures
of 600 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min and held for 2
h at 600 °C under nitrogen gas flow. After cooling down to room
temperature, the black residues were washed with distilled water to
remove excess KOH. Further purification of the activated carbons was
carried out by washing with distilled water and acetone. The resulting
activated carbons were dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h.

1H NMR spectra were recorded
by an Inova 500 instrument using DMSO-d6 as the solvent. FTIR spectra of all samples were recorded using
a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrophotometer and a typical KBr disk method
with 32 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm–1. The dynamic thermal curing behavior of the samples was monitored
at elevated temperatures using a cell mounted in the temperature-controlled
compartment of the FTIR spectrophotometer. The dynamic curing behavior
of all samples (5–7 mg) was also studied by DSC using a TA
Q-20 DSC apparatus, with a heating scan from 30 to 350 °C at
20 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal stabilities
of all samples were measured using a TA Q-50 TGA apparatus, with heating
from 30 to 800 °C at 20 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Jobin–Yvon
T6400 micro-Raman apparatus with a He–Cd laser as the excitation
source (325 nm). XPS was obtained from Thermo Scientific Theta Probe
using Mg Kα radiation from the double anode at 50 W. The related
binding energies of all samples in the high-resolution spectra were
calibrated by using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. EA was measured using
Thermo Flash 2000 to determine the C, H, N, and O contents. The N2 adsorption isotherms were determined using an ASAP 2020 analyzer
at −195 °C, whereas the CO2 adsorption isotherm
was evaluated at −78 °C. The CO2 uptake isotherms
were determined using an ASAP 2020 analyzer at 1 bar and 25 °C.
The samples of porous carbons were degassed at 150 °C for 8 h
prior to measurement. The BET method was used to measure the specific
surface areas, pore size distributions, and pore volumes from the
adsorption branches of the isotherms. UV–vis spectra were obtained
from Jasco Model V-770. Removal efficiency was calculated from the
following equation  where Ao and At are the absorbance of the iodine peak at 523
nm at the beginning and time t after reacting with
the adsorbent, respectively.
