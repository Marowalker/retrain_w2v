Most antibacterial
agents demand their action in the form of a
liquid for compatibility and ease of use in biosystems, which are
mainly composed of biological fluids. Controlling the colloidal stability
of metal oxide nanocolloids, in parallel with minimizing the effect
of using a large amount of surfactant on their biocidal activity and
cytotoxicity, remains a challenge. Here, we address the stability
of nanocolloids of ZnO and CuO in the presence of polymer surfactants
and the influence of the surface capping on their antibacterial activity
and cytotoxicity. The metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized
sonochemically in a single step and tested against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus to validate their biocidal
efficacy. Cytotoxicity studies were performed on human alveolar epithelial
cells. Polyethylene glycol- and polyvinyl alcohol-capped NPs are observed
to show the minimum cytotoxicity whereas polyethylene imine-capped
and pristine metal oxide NPs are toxic to the mammalian cells. The
cytotoxic and antibacterial properties of the stable nanocolloids
displayed an inverse relation, highlighting the role and significance
of the polymer capping. The nontoxic biocidal nanocolloids showed
an effective antibacterial efficacy of 99.9% in 2 h.

Introduction
Metal oxides are the
most explored class of inorganic materials
owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, controllable
particle size, low synthesis cost, and high stability.1 The use of metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), termed MONPs,
has drawn immense attention in the biomedical field as a result of
their biocompatibility, comparatively low toxicity, and reduced bacterial
resistance.2−4 Their role as biocidal agents flourished, as they
are considered biologically benign materials, which are relatively
less hazardous to the environment and human health. CuO and ZnO, being
constituted by essential elements, are more biocompatible than other
metal oxides and their toxicity is lower than, for example, silver-
or nickel-based NPs. However, the presence of heavy elements raises
the issues of cytotoxicity of these MONPs at higher concentrations.
In addition, the stability of the NPs toward agglomeration is an important
concern from the point of its applicability.5−8 Considering the primary issue
of stability, the profound effect of the size of the NPs on the antibacterial
activity of the MONPs renders importance to the stability of the NPs
in solution.9 The use of a surfactant or
capping agent proved to significantly prolong the lifespan of NPs
in suspension by avoiding agglomeration.10,11 In addition, during synthesis, the presence of surfactant molecules
in the reaction cell leads to the formation of smaller NPs, as nucleation
occurs in the surfactant matrix, with immediate capping of the NPs
by surfactant molecules, preventing further growth.

The cytotoxic
nature of MONPs is also a matter of concern because
of their potential effects on the human health and the environment.12,13 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered the primary mechanistic
pathway for the cellular oxidative stress resulting in biocidal activity
of MONPs, and are therefore used to determine the level of toxicity.14 The current work focuses on both issues by synthesizing
colloidal solutions of metal oxides in the presence of polymers as
surfactants and studying their biocidal and cytotoxic properties.
As most biological processes occur in an aqueous environment, the
application of MONPs in the suspended colloidal form is crucial for
better assimilation and functioning of these agents in biosystems.
Colloidal solutions of NPs, termed nanocolloids, are thus most suitable
for biological fluids. In order to achieve nanocolloids with higher
stability and a homogenous dispersion of NPs, ultrasound-assisted
synthesis was found to be an effective technique.4 Although nanocolloids of CuO and ZnO are widely exploited
in varied areas of nanoscience, their application as antibacterial
agents in the colloidal form was seldom explored.15−18 Khashan et al. tested the antibacterial
activity of CuO suspension prepared by laser ablation of the copper
metal pellet and reported a synergistic effect of the CuO NPs with
the antibiotic amoxicillin.19 Mahapatra
et al. prepared a CuO suspension by dispersing the as-synthesized
CuO NPs in water in the absence of surfactants and conducted antibacterial
and cytotoxicity studies.20 To our knowledge,
there are no reports in the literature of antibacterial and cytotoxicity
assays conducted on stable CuO/polymer nanocolloids with CuO NPs fabricated
in situ in the polymer matrix using ultrasonication. In the case of
ZnO, despite countless reports on its antibacterial activity, only
recently the biocidal properties were collated by our group following
a one-step synthesis of colloidal ZnO by the sonochemical method,28 providing the highest stability of ZnO NPs reported
so far.

Many studies addressed the toxic effects of CuO and
ZnO NPs, suggesting
possible hazardous effects in humans and other organisms.21 Although a large amount of toxicity data was
collected, a debate is still open about the properties of these MONPs,
in particular regarding their biological reactivity and adverse outcome
pathways that are evoked. The size and shape of the NPs, as well as
their crystalline structure, significantly influence the toxic behavior.
Smaller and round-shaped ZnO NPs tend to display higher toxicity than
bigger and rod-shaped particles.22,23 Similarly,
for CuO NPs, the small size of the particles was pointed out as a
main driver of cell toxicity, determining both higher bioavailability
and enhanced intracellular reactivity, finally determining significant
cytotoxic and genotoxic effects.24−26 In a previous study,
we investigated not only the antibacterial efficacy but also the cytotoxic
properties of differently synthesized CuO and ZnO NPs, which were
observed to depend on the size and shape and, perhaps even more interestingly,
on their crystalline structure.27

The adverse effects of MONPs on nontarget cells and organisms vary
according to the modalities by which the NPs interact with the biological
systems; for example, size, shape, and agglomeration are able to modulate
differently the endocytosis mechanism.28 At the same time, the protein corona effect can be modulated by
the NP physicochemical characteristics as well as by the medium in
which NPs are dispersed.29 Doped or coated
MONPs were seen to induce different toxicities in human cells, and
it was put in relation to the decreased dissolution or to the more
or less bioavailability, according to the surface identity acquired
by the NPs.30 These modalities change according
to the physicochemical properties of the NP, and today there is very
active investigation aimed at lowering the adverse biological effects
of MONPs by controlling the influencing factors, for example, the
NP size, shape, and surface properties. Toxicity and biocompatibility
studies on polymer-capped MONPs are therefore of high relevance.

The current study reports the first attempt, to the best of our
knowledge, to synthesize MONP colloids by a facile one-step sonochemical
method and concomitantly characterize their biological activity. Stability
issues in the formed suspensions are obviated by using optimal amounts
of polymer that serves as the capping agent. The surfactant-stabilized
nanocolloids are compared with their pristine MONP counterparts, and
the biocidal properties are discussed, along with the aspects related
to the toxicity.

Results and Discussion
Optical and Morphological
Characterization
The surfactant-stabilized
synthesis of ZnO and CuO nanocolloids was achieved in a single step
using the well-established ultrasound technique.31 Three water-soluble surfactants were used—polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and polyethylenimine (PEI)
in different weight ratios with respect to the precursor metal acetate.
As the stability of a colloid grows with the amount of the capping
agent surrounding the NP in the liquid matrix, a substantial amount
of surfactant was used to impart maximal stability to the synthesized
colloids; weight ratios of the surfactant to metal acetate were optimized,
as mentioned in Table S1. Increasing the
amount of surfactant above 30 wt % with respect to the metal salt
precursor hindered complete formation of MONPs in the matrix. This
was evidenced by the appearance of a translucent turbid liquid after
addition of ammonia instead of opaque white (ZnO) or dark brown (CuO)
colored colloids, indicating an incomplete reaction. The formation
of CuO was not achieved in the PVA matrix because of the formation
of a green-colored Cu(II)–PVA complex,32,33 which inhibited the hydrolysis of Cu2+ ions in the solution.
As shown in Table S1, the amount of PEI
is restricted to 5 wt % because of its basic nature, which raises
the pH of the solution above 9. This leads to dissolution of the as-formed
metal oxide NPs, impeding formation of a nanocolloid.

The crystallinity
and structure of the synthesized metal oxides with different surfactants
were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 1). The peaks of ZnO and CuO correspond to
the planes of hexagonal zincite and monoclinic tenorite, respectively,
and match the Joint Committee for Powder Diffraction Studies (JCPDS)
files no. 70-2551 and 41-0254, respectively. The bulk amount of polymer
in the reaction mixture did not affect the crystallinity of the NPs.
The formation of ZnO and CuO NPs in the polymer matrix was further
confirmed by recording UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure S1). The pristine ZnO shows an absorption
peak at 364 nm, while the surfactant-capped NPs exhibit peaks at lower
wavelengths, indicating smaller particles. ZnO–PVA displayed
absorption peaks at 344 and 357 nm, ascribed to ZnO NPs and ZnO–PVA
complex, respectively.31 Similarly, absorption
peaks at 346 and 361 nm were observed for ZnO–PEG and ZnO–PEI,
respectively; the higher absorption wavelength of the latter, indicating
larger particles, can be imputed to the significantly lower amount
of surfactant used. UV–vis spectra of the CuO colloids revealed
a broad absorption region centered at 298, 287, and 276 nm for CuO,
CuO–PEG, and CuO–PEI, respectively (Figure S1). Thus, we can state that the blue shift in the
absorption spectra of the polymer-capped NPs with respect to their
pristine forms affirms that NPs with a smaller average size were formed
in the presence of the capping agent.

with (i) PEI, (ii)
PEG, and (iii) PVA and (iv) pristine and (b) CuO-capped with (i) PEI

The stability of the NPs in the colloid can be estimated
from the
zeta potentials, which assess the surface charge on the nanoparticle.
Higher zeta potentials imply increased charge, and thus stronger electrostatic
repulsion, preventing the colloidal NPs from coming in contact with
each other and minimizing agglomeration. The zeta potentials of the
polymer-capped ZnO and CuO NPs are depicted in Figure 2. The lower values observed for the PEI-capped
NPs imply that they are less stable. ZnO–PEG and CuO–PEG
exhibited good stability over a period of 40 days, compared to the
other surfactant-stabilized nanocolloids, in agreement with the zeta
potentials observed for these samples. The pristine ZnO and CuO NPs
synthesized in the absence of surfactant agglomerate and precipitate
within 1 h of sonication.

Antibacterial Activity
and Mechanism
The antibacterial
properties of the polymer-capped ZnO and CuO nanocolloids are demonstrated
against two types of bacterial strains: Escherichia
coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus
aureus (Gram-positive). The killing kinetics for both
strains of bacteria were monitored by the culturing (CFU/mL) method.
The biocidal activity of the synthesized nanocolloids (tested at a
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL) is represented in Figures 3 and 4. For E. coli, CuO–PEG and ZnO–PVA demonstrated
99.9% bacterial killing after 120 min of exposure, while CuO–PEI
and ZnO–PEG were less active. ZnO, ZnO–PEI, and CuO
showed 1, 1, and 2 log reduction, respectively, after 180 min exposure
to the bacteria. Similarly, for S. aureus, CuO–PEG showed complete reduction after 120 min, whereas
the same was observed for ZnO–PVA and CuO–PEI after
180 min of exposure. ZnO, CuO, and ZnO–PEI were found to exhibit
lower antibacterial efficacy. The higher resistance of S. aureus, compared with E. coli, is ascribed to the thick peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall of S. aureus, making it less susceptible to the action
of the MONPs.34,35 Therefore, the observed higher
antibacterial activity of CuO than ZnO was also validated previously
and is in accordance with the present study.36

The most plausible mechanism for
the effective biocidal activity
of the metal oxides is believed to be the generation of ROS, which
are a class of free radical species of oxygen.37,38 These strong oxidants cause oxidative stress in the cell, damaging
the cellular components and leading to cell disruption and death.39 Assuming that a similar mechanism is responsible
for the activity observed, correlation between generated ROS and the
particle size of the NPs is developed. Electron spin resonance (ESR)
is a widely used tool for detection of free radicals, in particular
for measurement of ROS using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap.40 DMPO captures •OH and superoxide anions, giving a quadrant signal
arising from DMPO-OH and DMPO-OOH, respectively. Using equal concentrations
of DMPO and the samples, comparison is based on the intensity of the
quartet signal. The higher the signal intensity, the higher is the
production of ROS by the NP. Figure 5 presents the quartet ESR signals and signal intensities
of the ROS generated by the nanocolloids. The relative amounts of
ROS produced by the samples are: CuO–PEG > ZnO–PVA
>
CuO–PEI > ZnO–PEG > CuO > ZnO–PEI >
ZnO. The
ESR results favor the biocidal activity rendered by the capped metal
oxide colloids, wherein higher ROS accounts for faster killing of
the bacteria by the nanocolloid. Thus, the bacterial survival rate
is observed to decrease with the increase in total ROS concentration.

CuO NPs in the surfactant matrix and (b) integrated area depicting
signal intensity of the generated ROS.

Having affirmed that the expected mechanism of ROS generation
is
indeed responsible for the effective antibacterial potency of the
nanomaterials, the source and enhancement in its production are further
elucidated in detail. The primary source of ROS formation is the presence
of lattice defect sites in the nanomaterial; these sites serve as
active spots for adsorption of water molecules and their dissociation,
generating oxygen radicals.27,41 The present study in
which metal oxide nanocolloids were synthesized using ultrasound supports
this finding. The acoustic energy from the sonication process during
nucleation of the metal oxide crystal introduces defects and dislocations,
yielding a highly perturbed nanocrystal.31,42 The size of the NP also has a profound effect on the amount of ROS
generated by the nanomaterial. Compared to the bulk particle, the
NP has a higher surface area and thus higher surface reactivity for
ROS production.43 The particle sizes of
the NPs reported here, along with the ESR signal intensity of the
ROS, are in accordance with the observed bactericidal efficiency of
these nanocolloids. A Table S2 summarizes
the average particle sizes and the corresponding zeta potential values.
The lowest particle sizes of ∼6 and ∼7 nm are displayed
by CuO–PEG and ZnO–PVA, respectively (Figures 6 and S2). These samples indeed show the highest ROS production and clearly
exhibit the best antibacterial efficacy among the NPs. Pristine ZnO
and CuO, without stabilizing agents, have the largest particle size,
which might be responsible for their reduced antibacterial activity.

Cytotoxicity of the Nanocolloids
Cytotoxicity was measured
in human A549 cells exposed to the colloidal ZnO and CuO NPs for 3
and 24 h; results are shown in Figure 7. It is clear that with the exception of CuO–PEI,
which revealed higher toxicity than pristine CuO, all colloidal ZnO
and CuO NPs are less cytotoxic than the corresponding pristine NPs
after both 3 h (Figure 7a,b) and 24 h (Figure 7c,d).

Cell viability was measured by the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] MTT assay. (a,b) Effects of ZnO and CuO NPs after 3 h exposure
and (c,d) effects of ZnO and CuO NPs after 24 h exposure.

The polymer capping of the ZnO NPs resulted in
less effective modulation
of the cytotoxicity, as after 24 h exposure all ZnO nanocolloids were
strongly cytotoxic at concentrations ≥20 ppm, while no effects
were measured for pristine and surfactant-capped ZnO exposure to ≤10
ppm (Figure 6c). After
3 h of exposure, the ZnO nanocolloids demonstrated lower cytotoxicity
with respect to pristine ZnO (Figure 6a); it is noteworthy that ZnO–PVA did not induce
any decrease in cell viability even at the highest concentration tested,
confirming PVA capping as the most promising approach for safer ZnO
NPs.

Regarding CuO, stabilization with PEI conferred an augmented
cytotoxic
potential to the NPs, as demonstrated by the significant and concentration-dependent
decrease in cell viability at both 3 and 24 h exposures (Figure 6b,d). On the contrary,
CuO–PEG was only slightly cytotoxic, as a significant decrease
in cell viability was observed only after 24 h exposure at very high
(50 ppm) concentration (Figure 6d). After 3 h, pristine CuO was already cytotoxic, while CuO–PEG
was not, and during the 3 h, it even induced a slight increase in
cell metabolism (Figure 6b). After 24 h exposure, the cytotoxicity of CuO was significantly
rescued by PEGylation (Figure 6d), as cell viability did not significantly decrease even
with respect to the control until the highest exposure concentration
of 50 ppm.

From the toxicity studies, we can conclude that the
polymer stabilization
of the NP suspensions was very effective in modulating the cytotoxic
properties of CuO, while for ZnO it was less effective. PEI coating
makes the CuO NPs more cytotoxic, while PEGylation renders them safer.

The higher cytotoxicity of the MONPs with PEI as the surfactant
is in accordance with the significantly lower amount of surfactant
used, leading to increased exposure of the NPs to the cell surface.
Moreover, PEI was recognized as an agent that promotes cell penetration
and is commonly used as a gene delivery agent owing to its high transfection
efficiency; it is also known to interact with the negatively charged
cell surface, promoting its attachment to the cell and cell uptake.44,45 The fact that at 3 h of exposure, PEI is able to enhance the cytotoxic
properties of CuO NPs but not those of ZnO NPs can be justified by
the following claim. According to the proton-sponge effect, it can
induce a lysosomal escaping effect, which finally may determine an
increase of MONPs free in the cytoplasm, where they can induce oxidative
damages to the intracellular membrane systems. It was demonstrated
that in the water aqueous environment, sonochemically synthesized
CuO NPs produce more ROS than ZnO NPs. If in the presence of PEI,
they are released from the endolysosomal compartments, without massive
dissolution (and it likely occurs during short-term exposure, e.g.
3 h), CuO NPs may induce higher oxidative damages to protein and lipid
membrane domains, culminating in a significant decrease in cell viability.
At prolonged exposure time (24 h), the extracellular and intracellular
dissolution of CuO and ZnO NPs become the main determinant of the
induced toxicity, masking the effect of the polymers used. This is
particularly relevant for ZnO NPs, which dissolve easier than CuO
ones, ending up in comparable cytotoxic effects of ZnO colloidal suspensions
produced with the different polymers. However, the speculations need
additional experimental evidences to be proved and are of interest
for future study. The novel nanomaterial CuO–PEI, which combines
the high surface reactivity of the CuO NPs with the unique properties
of the PEI surface coating, could potentially be useful in selective
killing of human cells undergoing uncontrolled proliferation.

Regarding the safety of the antibacterial metal oxide nanocolloids,
the results highlight CuO–PEG as the most promising material
capable of preserving cell viability, followed by ZnO–PVA.

It is interesting to note that, with the exclusion of the PEI-capped
NPs, the cytotoxicity follows an inverse relation with the antibacterial
activity and ROS generation capacity of the MONPs in a cell-free environment.
To explain these interesting experimental results, more research on
the toxicity mechanisms in both bacterial and human cells is required.

At the moment, based on the literature, we can speculate that PEG
surface coating of the CuO NPs could have influenced their cellular
internalization and successive intracellular reactivity. It is known
that PEG functional coating of different NPs determines their cellular
uptake and internalization.46,47 In addition, on account
of its biocompatibility, PEGyaltion of NPs is a reported strategy
to minimize the nanotoxicity of the particles, with diminished impact
on cell viability. This is because PEG on the surface prevents the
particle opsonization by the proteins present in the body fluids or
in the cell culture media, which has been seen to enhance NP uptake
by receptor-mediated endocytosis (thus preventing phagocytosis by
specialized immune cells).48 Hence, also
in the present work, PEGylation may have determined a lower internalization
of CuO NPs in human cells, justifying the low toxicity even in the
presence of highly reactive NPs. On the contrary, it is demonstrated
that the mechanism at the base of the antibacterial activity of CuO
NPs is related to the contact at the cell surface level and the consequent
oxidative stress leading to the cell death. Together with the high
capability of mammalian cells to efficiently buffer oxidative stress
by a complex intracellular enzymatic system,49,50 the current results may justify the increased safety of CuO–PEG
toward mammalian cells, while being strongly toxic toward bacterial
cells.51,52

The less effective results achieved
with polymer coating of ZnO
NPs, including PEGylation, with respect to CuO NPs, may be attributed
to the different cytotoxic mechanism of these two metal oxides. For
CuO, a significant role in the toxicity toward mammalian cells is
played by the particle surface reactivity—PEGylated CuO showed
the lowest cytoxicity, followed by the PEI-coated and pristine CuO
NPs. For ZnO, on the other hand, a major role was attributed to the
Zn ion dissolution both extra- and intracellularly.53 The intracellular dissolution of the ZnO NPs, which determines
the cytotoxicity of the ZnO, increases with the concentration of the
NPs and shows a profound effect at concentrations higher than 10 μg/mL.54 The solubility product constant (Ksp) of CuO is around 10–22 at room temperature,
meaning that there are effectively no ions of Cu2+ in the
solution (the concentration of Cu ions is 10–11 M).
On the other hand, the Ksp of ZnO is much
higher—around 10–10, yielding 10–5 mol per liter of Zn2+. This significant solubility could
explain the higher cytotoxicity of ZnO.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have demonstrated antibacterial and cytotoxic
studies conducted on stable ZnO and CuO nanocolloids synthesized using
a high amount of surfactant. The sonochemical method reported is unique
and feasible to scale up preparation of metal oxide nanocolloids for
wide use as antibacterial agents. The present results confirm the
crucial role of polymer capping in mitigating the effect of NPs on
mammalian cells, while still exhibiting notable antibacterial effects.
The current study also affirms the role and significance of the type
of polymer used as the capping agent in deciding the overall cytotoxicity
of the samples. PEI is observed to enhance toxicity, whereas PEGylation
of the NPs reduces the toxic effect. Finally, solubility of the MONPs
is a decisive factor in their cytotoxicity—ZnO is much more
soluble than CuO, offering a plausible explanation of the higher toxicity
of ZnO–PEG relative to CuO–PEG.

Experimental Section
Zn(II) acetate dihydrate, Cu(II) acetate monohydrate, poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) MW = 88–98 K, PEG MW = 6 K, and PEI branched
50% w/v in H2O MW = 75 K were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received without further purification. The precursor salts
and polymers were separately dissolved in deionized water. The two
solutions were mixed together to obtain a total volume of 100 mL.
The concentration of metal ions was maintained at 0.01 M, and the
weight ratios of the metal acetate to polymer were 1:5 for Cu(acetate)·H2O/PEI and Zn(acetate)·2H2O/PEI and 1:30 for
the rest. The obtained solution of metal ions with the dissolved polymer
was irradiated with an ultrasonic probe (Ti-horn@20 kHz, 100 W cm–2). The temperature was allowed to rise, and upon reaching
60 °C, ∼0.2 mL of an aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide
(28–30%) was introduced into the reaction mixture to achieve
a pH of ∼8. Completion of the reaction was indicated by color
change—from colorless to white and from bluish-green to dark
brown for ZnO and CuO, respectively, confirming the formation of MONPs
in the colloidal polymer matrix. Sonication was continued for 30 min,
and the mixture was chilled in an ice bath to maintain a reaction
temperature of 25 °C. Pristine ZnO and CuO in suspension were
synthesized by following the same procedure in the absence of polymers.

Characterization
XRD patterns for ZnO and CuO were
obtained using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-107 X-ray diffractometer using
Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) as the source. Zeta potential
was performed on a Nano ZS Malvern Zetasizer instrument. High-resolution
transmission electron microcopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained using
a JEOL JEM-2100 model operated at an accelerated voltage of 200 kV.
The absorption spectrum of the ZnO–PVA nanofluid was recorded
on a CARY Bio 100 spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). The metal
oxide concentration in the colloid was determined by inductively coupled
plasma analysis. The amount of generated ROS was determined by ESR
using a 121 Bruker EPR 100d X-band spectrometer with DMPO as a spin
trap. To 80 μL of the colloidal sample, 20 μL of DMPO
(0.01 M) was added, and the solution was drawn by a syringe into a
gas-permeable Teflon capillary. The capillary was folded twice, inserted
into a narrow quartz tube open at both ends, and placed in the ESR
cavity. The blank was measured by replacing the sample with deionized
water.

Antibacterial Assay
The antibacterial activities of
the synthesized metal oxide colloids with different capping agents
were tested against two common strains of bacteria, namely Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus. The antibacterial activity of these different nanocolloids was
investigated using the colony-forming units per mL (CFU/mL) method.
Strains of both bacteria were aerobically grown by incubating overnight
at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) broth. Following incubation, 0.2
mL aliquots were transferred to 10 mL of fresh LB broth and incubated
at 37 °C for a further 3 h. The culture was further diluted 3-fold
in LB broth to yield a bacterial suspension with a density of 105 CFU/mL. Time-kill experiments were conducted by adding 500
μL of nanocolloid solution (0.5 mg/mL) to 500 μL of bacterial
suspension. The suspensions were shaken on a rotary shaker at 200
rpm and simultaneously incubated at 37 °C. After every 30 min,
100 μL aliquots were taken from each sample, diluted 10-fold
in 10% LB medium, and transferred to nutrient agar plates. The plates
were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and counted for viable bacteria.

Cytotoxicity
Aqueous NP suspensions used for cytotoxicity
studies were obtained by diluting the stock colloidal suspensions
in the cell culture medium to obtain final concentrations of 1, 10,
20, 25, and 50 μg/mL of ZnO and CuO. The suspensions of pristine
ZnO and CuO were obtained by diluting the NP powders in ultrapure
(MQ) water to obtain stock suspensions of 2 mg/mL, which were sonicated
for 30 min in an ultrasonic bath (Sonica Ultrasonic Extractor, Soltec,
Italy). Aliquots from the stock solution were prediluted in MQ water
(20-fold intermediate stock solution of NPs) and added to microplate
wells containing serum-free OptiMEM medium to achieve the same NP
test concentrations used for the colloidal suspensions.

The
cell viability assay was performed following routine procedures established
in our lab, as reported by Moschini et al.25 Human alveolar epithelial cells, ATCC A549 (American Type Culture
Collection), were routinely maintained in culture. For cell viability
assays, cells were seeded (8 × 105) in six multiwell
plates and exposed to NP suspensions for 3 and 24 h. Untreated cells
were used as the control. At the end of treatments, cells were rinsed,
and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]
was added over 3 h to a final concentration of 0.0625 mg/mL in OptiMEM
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The medium was removed, and the
purple MTT reduction product (formazan crystals) was dissolved in
DMSO. The absorbance of each sample, proportional to cell viability,
was measured with a MultiskanAscent multiplate reader spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) at 570 nm using 690 nm as the
reference wavelength. Cell viability was expressed as OD mean percent
(±SE). Statistical differences were tested by one-way ANOVA followed
by Dunnett’s test after evaluating the homogeneity of the variances
among the treatment groups with the Levene test. Otherwise, for groups
whose variances were found to be nonhomogeneous, statistical differences
were tested with the Student’s t-test followed by Bonferroni’s
test.
