Mercury (Hg) is one
of the main water contaminants worldwide. In
this study, we have developed both whole-cell and cell-free biosensors
to detect Hg. Genetically modified plasmids containing the merR gene
were used to design biosensors. Firefly luciferase (LucFF) and emerald
green fluorescent protein (EmGFP) genes were separately introduced
as a reporter. Both constructs showed a detection limit of 1 ppb (Hg)
in Escherichia coli and the cell-free
system. We found that higher concentrations of Hg become detrimental
to bacteria. This cytotoxic effect shows an anomalous result in high
Hg concentrations. This was also observed in the cell-free system.
We found that EmGFP fluorescence was decreased in the cell-free system
because of a change in pH and quenching effect by Hg excess. Once
the pH was adjusted to 7 and a chelating agent was used, the EmGFP
fluorescence was partially restored. These adjustments can only be
done in the cell-free system after the GFP expression and not in whole
cells where their number has been decreased because of toxicity. Therefore,
we suggest the use of the cell-free-system, which not only reduces
the total experimental time but also allows us to perform these postexperimental
adjustments to achieve higher sensitivity. We would also recommend
to perform more measurements at a time with different dilution factors
to bring down the Hg concentration within the measurable limits or
to use some other chelating agents which can further reduce the excess
Hg concentration.

Introduction
Mercury and most of
its compounds are extremely toxic. In many
areas worldwide, it is well-known as a water contaminant. When up
taken, it causes health hazards such as gastrointestinal, neurological,
and renal organ disorders.1 Thus, it is
necessary to monitor the mercury levels in drinking water regularly.
In general, physicochemical methods and high-end analytical techniques
are used for the quantitative analysis of mercury,2−4 although frequent
use of these methods is not possible because they are costly and non-eco-friendly.5 Atomic absorption spectroscopy or inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies, USA) can be
used as alternative methods, but they are very expensive and need
special operational expertise. Thus, there is a stern need for an
effective, low-cost, and user- and eco-friendly monitoring system
for the detection of mercury contaminants at low concentrations. Biosensors
can be a better option offering a reduced cost and quick measurement.
So, it is apparently the most favorable way to assess the bioavailability
of mercury in water samples. Biosensors can have an electronic or
an optical readout system. Bacteria propose plethora for the development
of whole-cell and cell-free biosensors for detection of different
contaminants in the environment.6 A different
strategy for making a microbial biosensor has been developed using
a reporter gene connected to a regulatory promoter, where the regulatory
gene has been isolated from the genetically encoded resistant system
that allows the microbes to grow in an unfavorable environment.6

In recent years, cell-free transcription/translation
has been used
as an important tool to perform protein expression-based sensing.7,8 The key advantage of this technique lies in the faster expression
of recombinant proteins, and additionally, it allows for rapid screening
and product development without performing time-consuming bacterial
culture methods.9,10 A cell-free biosensor can have
many advantages over a whole-cell biosensor, as it simplifies and
optimizes the construction of operon circuits for detection of specific
heavy metals.11 It is less time-consuming
because in a whole cell biosensor, various enzymes have to be tested,
and genetic modifications are always tricky and require considerable
time.12 As the cellular growth and expression
are correlated, the analyte-dependent changes in growth kinetics can
be overruled by using a cell-free system. In cell-free expression
systems, different pathways can also be encoded by adding DNA (plasmid/genomic)
at relative concentrations.13 In this study,
the cell-free expression has been used for heavy metal sensing. merR,
the transcriptional activator gene of the Pseudomonas sp. K-62 strain,14 mediated expression
of the MerR transcriptional activator protein, which has been considered
to grow cells on mercury. Active site prediction for mercury and then
docking15 were performed using the MerR
protein and Hg2+ to confirm their interaction computationally.
This study aimed to construct both whole-cell and cell-free (plasmid-mediated)
luminescence/fluorescence-based sensors for cost-effective and sensitive
detection of mercury, where luciferase (LucFF) and emerald green fluorescent
protein (EmGFP genes are used as reporters separately.6,14 Thus, both recombinant DNA constructs (pRLucMer19 and pRGfpMer19)
were synthesized to sense mercury in liquid solutions in both cell-free-
and whole-cell-based biosensors. The limit of detection (LOD) for
both constructs has been compared in our studies.

Results
Active Site
Prediction and Docking Analysis
To confirm
the binding of Hg to the MerR protein, a computational study was performed.
Active site prediction and docking analysis confirms the wet lab study
results. Active site prediction for mercury binding to the MerR protein
was performed by PASS algorithm. It was found that Hg2+ binds to the MerR protein at cysteine residues. Docking was carried
out with autodock 4.2, and a +2 charge was assigned to Hg manually
after the protein database (PDB) file preparation. In the case of
Hg 201, cysteine residues at the C-terminus (position 146 and 154)
show interaction with Hg2+ (Figure 1). The estimated free energy of binding is
−5.63 kcal/mol and the final docked energy is −7.33
kcal/mol, whereas in the case of Hg 202, the estimated free energy
of binding is +5.11 kcal/mol and the final docked energy is +3.46
kcal/mol.

was assigned to Hg manually after PDB file preparation.

Construction of pRLucMer19 and pRGFPMer19
The plasmid
constructs were prepared according to the schematic diagram (Figures 2 and 3). The designed plasmid constructs were used as whole-cell
biosensors, where the merR gene and its promoter and operator were
placed in such an orientation that the reporter genes (firefly LucFF
or EmGFP) can be transcribed. Different restriction enzymes were incorporated
in pRLucMer19 and pRGfpMer19 (Figures 2 and 3). The restriction digestion
(Figure 3) pattern
confirmed the measure of the inserts.

Whole-Cell Biosensing
Luminometric Response of
pRLucMer19 to Mercury
In this
experiment, the pRLucMer19 plasmid-containing Escherichia
coli cells were grown in the presence of different
mercury concentrations as an inducer, and their luminescence was measured.
The LucFF activity showed linearity in the range of 1 to 104 ppb (ppb denotes parts per billion). These results revealed that
the MerR/mercury complex effectively binds to the LucFF operator and
activates the gene. The signal-to-noise ratio of the luminescence
for pRLucMer19 for the lowest mercury concentration (1 ppb) was also
found to be more than the required values (>2). Figure 4 represents the linear graph
for mercury
induction. This result of the microbial whole cell biosensors shows
that the detection of mercury contaminants can be used at low or medium
concentrations. After adding the substrate, the LucFF activity has
to be measured immediately, a fact that restricts multiple sample
measurements. To avoid this and get rid of substrate addition, EmGFP
has been introduced as a reporter. This will help us avoid manual
intervention and automatization.

Figure 4 Mercury concentration-dependent induction
and expression in E. coli containing
pRLucMer19. Luminescence was plotted
against mercury concentration. The mean and standard deviation of
three separate experiments have been plotted. The X-axis indicates the concentration of Hg (ppb) on the log scale. The
inset picture shows the linearity curve (R2 = 0.97) with the values from 10 to 10 000 ppb.

Fluorometric Responses of pRGfPMer19 to Mercury
We
confirm the proper orientation and placement of gene in pRGFPMer19.
As a result, the MerR protein is activated in the presence of mercury,
and the GFP gave a fluorescence signal even at 1 ppb (Figure 5). A linearity curve was obtained
for the range of 1–104 ppb (Figure 6). The expression of the reporter is always
associated with cell growth and the total number of cells. At higher
mercury concentrations, the cells were damaged, and hence fluorescence
started to reduce. Figure S2 shows the
fluorescence expression of the reporter gene (EmGFP) when both the
whole-cell biosensor (Figure S2A) and the
cell-free biosensor (Figure S2B) were induced
with other divalent cations (Cu2+ and Cd2+).
The fluorescence emission in the presence of Cu2+ and Cd2+ was found to be much lower than that of Hg2+.
The response was found to be selective against Hg2+.

and its measurement using fluorescence spectroscopy
when E. coli cells containing pRGfpMer19
plasmid was induced by 1 ppb mercury concentration in the whole-cell
biosensor system. The EmGFP expression was compared with the expression
of pRLucMer19 to confirm the specificity when incubating with mercury
and water.

was plotted against the mercury concentration. The mean and standard
deviation of three separate experiments have been plotted. The inset
picture shows about the linearity range of mercury (R2 = 0.99). The X-axis indicates the concentration
of Hg (ppb) on the log scale.

Cell Fate Study at Higher Concentration of Mercury
Fluorescence-Activated
Cell Sorting
Figure S3 shows the
dot plot of forwarding and side scatterings
of treated (with mercury) and untreated samples by using the FlowJO
(BD, Bioscience, USA) software at pH 7. Figure S3 denotes samples untreated (A) and treated with 1 to 105 ppb of mercury (B to H). An additional experiment at different
pH values was performed to check whether the toxic effect was given
by low pH conditions or by mercury (Hg). The Hg purchased from Sigma
comes in nitric acid (HNO3) solution. So, to keep mercury
soluble at higher amounts, the pH was reduced to around 1. To rule
out the effect of pH shock on the bacterial cell, we performed the
following experiment. Under three pH conditions (pH = 1, 4, and 7),
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed to check
the cell killing/viability. Propidium iodide dye was used for the
assay (Figure S4).

From the flow
cytometric results, it is clear that side scattering, which indicates
the internal complexity or granularity, is increased significantly
when treated with a higher concentration of mercury. At the same time,
the Forward Scattering (FSC) population of the samples markedly decreased at the higher concentration of mercury,
indicating a decrease in the size. In the case of different pH conditions
(pH = 1, 4, and 7), the side scattering values were increased at pH
= 4 and pH = 7 but not in the case of pH = 1. This comparative data
(for different pH ranges) reveals the effect of mercury toxicity and
the pH effect. At very low pH values (pH = 1), it seems that there
is an effect on the viability of the cells, whereas at pH = 4 and
7, only mercury toxicity effect was observed on the bacterial cell.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The cells were incubated
in the presence of different concentrations of mercury, and then their
structures were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
The electron micrographs (Figure S5) show
us that there is a clear change in the surface morphology of E. coli cells with the increase of the mercury concentration.

Cell Killing Assay
The bacterial cell killing assay
was performed on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plates, and the results
are summarized in Figure S6. Different
concentrations (1 to 105 ppb) of mercury were incubated
with E. coli cells containing the recombinant
plasmid pRLucMer19 and pRGfpMer19. It was fully in concurrence with
the data obtained through the SEM analysis. An initial (1 to 103 ppb) increase was seen in a number of colonies, which were
observed and counted after incubation. Afterward, a regular decrease
was seen up to 104 ppb, and no colony was found at 105 ppb concentration. It is clear that the toxicity of Hg2+ is the main reason for the decreased expression of the reporter
gene in the whole-cell-based sensors. It is not clear why a similar
effect was observed in the cell-free system too, where no cell growth
is associated with the expression.

To avoid this dependency
and to reduce the total experimental time, we have used the cell-free
transcriptional-translation system.

Cell-Free Biosensing
Fluorometric
Responses of pRGfPMer19 to Mercury
Experiments
were performed to check the fluorometric response of the pRGfpMer19
plasmid only using a cell-free expression system, and it also showed
sufficient induction in the presence of a concentration regime of
1 ppb to 105 ppb (Figure 7). At the higher concentration of Hg, the whole cell
and cell free systems showed a decrease in reporter gene expression. We wanted to investigate the reason
behind the decrease in both cases.

Figure 7 EmGFP expression and its measurements
using fluorescence spectroscopy
when the pRGfpMer19 plasmid was induced by different mercury concentrations
(1–105 ppb) in the cell-free transcription and translation
system (Promega). A universal peak of fluorescence was observed at
530 nm. The inset picture shows about the linearity range of mercury
(R2 = 0.99).

Fluorescence Quenching of EmGFP Because of Hg Concentration
and pH Difference
To analyze the decreased fluorescence with
the increased concentration of mercury, we took the purified EmGFP
and studied the quenching effect of the mercury itself. As the concentration
of mercury was increased, the fluorescence intensity of the EmGFP
molecule decreased (Figure 8). To resolve this, we looked at the changes associated with
Hg2+solution addition. At first, we checked the pH of the
resultant solution. At higher concentrations (104 and 105 ppb), the pH of the solutions was shifted to 1.5. Thus, we
neutralized the pH and was able to recover the EmGFP fluorescence
even at a higher concentration (104 ppb) of Hg (Figure S7). Moreover, the metal ion-induced quenching
of fluorescence is known.

Figure 8 Fluorescence quenching of EmGFP in the presence
of different concentrations
of mercury (Hg). Purified EmGFP was kept in PBS (0.01 M, pH = 7.4)
buffer. Purified green fluorescent protein (EmGFP) was incubated with
mercury at different concentrations to check the quenching effect
of the EmGFP expression.

Removal of Excess Hg Using EDTA as Chelating Agent
So, in the next phase, we wanted to remove the Hg excess to recover
the GFP fluorescence at higher concentrations of Hg. We thus added
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to chelate out the untreated
Hg from the solution (Figure 9). The fluorescence intensity was recovered significantly,
and it was found that 15 mM EDTA was optimum for maximum EmGFP fluorescence.

solution. EDTA was added to chelate out the untreated Hg from the
solution. The fluorescence intensity can be recovered significantly,
and it was found that 15 mM EDTA was optimum for maximum EmGFP fluorescence.

Discussion
Every
day there is an increase in environmental pollution because
of the dispense of heavy metals such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), copper
(Cu), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), antimony
(Sb), and so forth. Mostly, they contaminate the groundwater and subsequently
play a key role in causing human health hazards. Among these, mercury
is one of the major contaminants. Many new technologies have been
developed in the last decade for the detection of mercury.16,17 Previously, mercury-based whole-cell biosensors were reported with
different reporter genes capable of detecting different mercury concentrations.18 Among these, the microorganism-based method
has gained popularity, where the contaminant-induced expression of
the LucFF gene and subsequent luminescence production is measured
for sensing applications. Still, there are many disadvantages of the
whole-cell and LucFF-based biosensors.19 So, the aim of our work is to overcome the drawbacks. Thus, we started
with the previously reported merR gene.14 Before the wet experiments, we performed the theoretical and computational
studies on Hg2+ binding to the MerR protein. The docking
results showed that due to a negative (low) free energy, Hg2+ binds to Cys residues between positions 146 and 154, whereas due
to a positive (high) energy, Hg2+ is unable to bind to
the MerR region in the case of Hg 202. These in silico results confirm
the interaction between MerR and Hg2+ in the Pseudomonas sp. K-62 strain. As the MerR protein
structure from Pseudomonas sp. K-62
strain is not available in the PDB, this computational study will
help recognize the functional and binding capabilities of the same
proteins/genes from different biological sources.15 The detection system is based on induction of the merR
gene that depends on the microbial growth, which in turn activates
the reporter gene (LucFF). Firefly LucFF requires both luciferin and
adenosine 5′-triphosphate as substrates to produce a luminescent
signal. Firefly LucFF is very sensitive and has broad dynamic ranges.
Using the merR regulatory gene and LucFF, we can achieve the detection
limit of 1 ppb. Cell lysis is required to allow the substrate and
LucFF enzyme to react under cytosolic conditions. The main demerit
of LucFF is, unlike fluorescent reporter proteins, it does not allow
to develop live cell assays and is restricted to a single data point
in each experiment.20 The automation is
hindered because of the step required for the addition of substrate
for the LucFF assay. Moreover, the signal associated with luminescence
measurement is transient, and it is very critical to measure just
after the addition of the substrate. The time delay for the later
samples results in the diminished signal. Thus, it restricts the use
for multiple measurements. So, we have replaced our LucFF reporter
gene by EmGFP and reconstructed the plasmid pRGfpMer19 from pRLucMer19,
where we have replaced the Luc gene with EmGFP.

While studying
the sensitivity at higher mercury concentrations,
we found that after a certain value, the cell-based biosensors show
much lower effective concentration. It was reported that this was
due to the mercury-induced cell death.21,22 It was supported
by the cell-killing assay, FACS analysis, and the deformed granular
structures of the cells were visualized by SEM. This has been overlooked
for a long time where everyone is interested to achieve a lower detection
limit,23 but still, there are constraints
or limitations as the microbes tend to behave differently at higher
concentrations. In the whole cell, the Hg2+-induced toxicity
showed a killing effect. To check whether the effect of cell killing
is due to very low pH or due to Hg, FACS at different pH levels was
performed, which clearly indicated that bacterial cells deteriorated
at high Hg concentrations (105 ppb) (Figure S3).

Growing the cells is also time-consuming
and requires multiple
steps. To minimize the total time of production and detection and
to eliminate the dependency of cell growth, we used a cell-free transcription
and translation system. Both the plasmids in the cell-free medium
also showed linearity and a LOD of 1 ppb. The cell-free system reduced
the measurement time drastically, as the laboratory-based cell culture
was completely avoided by this method.

Thus, we have reduced
the total assay time from 4 to 1 h. In this
continuation, our study reports the new strategy based on green fluorescent
and LucFF-based whole cell and a cell-free biosensor (Figure S1) for detection of mercury, where we
can achieve the sensitivity of 1 ppb with 1 h time for reporter gene
or incubation. EmGFP with increased sensitivity also provided stability
to the measurement system (Table S1).11,24−26

GFP is very sensitive, and its fluorescence
is dependent on many
factors; but at higher concentration of Hg, the GFP fluorescence was
still at a lower level than expected, and linearity was lost. Therefore,
we continued to work on purified GFP protein and evaluated the effect
of Hg2+ on it and how its fluorescence can be recovered.27 The pH adjustment partially recovers the EmGFP
fluorescence where the use of EDTA as a chelating agent recovered
further by removing the excess Hg ions from the solution27 (Figure S2). Thus,
the metal ion-induced quenching28 of GFP
was minimized. This method would be helpful as it could be used to
remove Hg from industrial or clinical waste after quantification by
the Luc- and GFP-based biological sensors.29−32 We, therefore, present a complete
process of biomonitoring and bioremediation in a single protocol.
Further in continuation, we would like to design a portable device
for heavy metal detection, in which we can detect various heavy metals
simultaneously by varying different specific cell-free constructs.
As the cell-free transcription/translation system does not require
any cellular culture at all and allows for postexperimental changes
in pH and removal of Hg2+ excess, it can be revised as
an automated system.

Conclusions
The designed microbial
and cell-free biosensor presented here using
the merR regulatory gene is one of the new strategies to detect mercury
contaminants by tailoring microbial genetic systems that opens up
an excellent platform for microorganism-based biosensing. Two recombinant
DNA constructs, pRLucMer19 and pRGfpMer19, were designed and synthesized
to sense mercury contaminants in water. Both the constructs showed
high sensitivity to detect mercury. The GFP-based construct reduced
the substrate addition step in comparison to the LucFF-based system.
While using this technique, we have considered the cellular responses
to the concentration of the contaminants, which we generally overlook.
The contaminant itself becomes toxic to the cellular system, which
results in false estimation. To avoid this, we have come up with the
cell-free system, which has been found to be a better choice for the
quantification of the contaminant, as it is independent of the cellular
response against the contaminants. Moreover, this cell-free system
allows us to get rid of the cell culture, and thus the total experimental
time is drastically reduced. In summary, we can say that merR gene-based
biosensors can be developed for the detection of a broad concentration
range of mercury contaminants in water using these constructs and
a cell-free system.

Methods
Proposed Binding Sites
and Docking
Prior to wet lab
experiments, an initial bioinformatic study was done to ensure binding
of the MerR protein (from Pseudomonas K-62 strain) to Hg2+. PASS algorithm was used to calculate
the center of mass of the active site, and docking was carried out
with autodock 4.2, and a +2 charge was assigned to Hg manually after
file preparation. Cysteine residues at the C-terminus (positions 146
and 154) show interaction with Hg2+.

Bacterial Strains
and Media
Plasmids were maintained
in E. coli DH5α33 and were cultured at 37 °C in LB media (Himedia, USA),
which includes yeast extract (0.5%) along with tryptone (1%) and NaCl
(0.5%) with antibiotic ampicillin (Merck, USA) (100 mg/mL) as a selection
marker. Pseudomonas sp. K-62 was a
gift from Masako Kiyono (Tokyo, Japan). The plasmid containing E. coli strain was grown at 25 °C in the defined
media of tryptic soy broth. Subculturing was done by adding the primary
culture from the log phase having an optical density (OD) of 0.4.

Construction of pRLucMer19 and pRGfpMer19
Isolation
of plasmids, including Pseudomonas Sp.
K-62 plasmids, were done using the Qiagen miniprep kit (CA, USA).
The mammalian vector, pGL3 basic, was procured from Promega (WI).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, ligation, transformation,
and other required techniques were performed using standard protocols.34 PCR was performed according to Bio-Rad using
the forward primer 285Xho forward-5′-ATATACTCGAGAGATCTTGGTGCAGGCCGA-3′
and the reverse primer-719Hindrev-5′-TATTAAGCTTATACGTTGGCCCTTTTGA-3′
to generate an insert, which includes the merR gene, promoter, and
the operator region. This insert was finally cloned into the pGL3
basic vector (Promega) to construct pRLucMerR19.

Second, PCR
was performed according to Bio-Rad using the forward primers 5′-ATACCATGGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCT-3′&
5′-ATTATCTAGATTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3′as reverse primer
to get an insert, which was cloned into the EmGFP vector (Promega)
for construction of pRGfpMer19. The whole work plan and sensing principle
are shown in (Figure 1), as a pRSET-EmGFP vector was double-digested with NcoI and Xba
I (New England Biolabs, USA) to make compatible ends to ligate with
the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to make pRGFPMer19. Then, this construct
was double-digested with XhoI and HindIII to clone the merR gene along
with the promoter and operator. Chemical analyses of mercury compounds
were done, and the standard methods of the American Public Health
Association35 were followed.

Treatment of
Mercury and Activity Assays for LucFF
E. coli DH5α cells having the
constructs, pRLucMer19 and pRGfpMer19, were cultured in 5 mL of 100
mg mL–1 ampicillin-containing LB media for 16 h
at 37 °C. Subculturing was done, and mercury solutions (Merck,
USA) of different concentrations (1 to 105 ppb) were added
to the media of the subculture at the log phase (OD = 0.4) at 600
nm. After 1 h, the cells were withdrawn and lysed with the lysis buffer
as provided by the manufacturer (Promega). Thereafter, centrifugation
was performed to get the supernatants. Finally, luminescence was measured
using a luminometer (Berthold, Germany).

Calculations36
Induction
of the plasmid construct (sensor) by mercury can be expressed as the
normalized luminescence given by the following equation  where luminescence produced by the
plasmid
construct (pRLucMer19) in different mercury concentrations is denoted
by SLS, and uninduced luminescence of the same plasmid
is defined by SLB. The correction factor is denoted as
CF, and it accounts for the possible interference of the sample turbidity,
color, and change in microbial growth kinetics due to the addition
of the substrate, which has to be quantified. The CF is determined
by the luminescence produced by the microbial culture (termed as the
control) without (LB) and with (LS) induction of the substrate and
denoted by the expression by CF = LB/LS.

Fluorescence Analysis
To check the effect of mercury
exposure on the EmGFP activity, a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Agilent, USA) was used. An excitation wavelength of 488 nm was used
for scanning, and an emission wavelength range of 500–600 nm
was used to check EmGFP activity. The filter bandwidth was adjusted
at 0.5 nm. The bandwidth of the excitation and emission filters was
set up to ±5 nm. For copper and cadmium ions, cadmium acetate
(Qualigens) and cupric sulphate extrapure (SD fine chemicals) were
used.

Cell-Free Protein Expression
Cell-free induction of
MerR was done by PURExpress Kit (NEB, USA) at different concentrations
of mercury solution. Plasmid pRLucMer19 was induced with six concentrations
of mercury (Merck, USA) solutions (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10 000,
and 100 000 ppb). Concentrations of plasmids and reagents were
kept according to the manufacturer manual (New England Biolabs). These
experiments were also followed for pRGfpMer19.

SEM
The treated
(with mercury) and untreated E. coli recombinant cells were prepared for the SEM
study. For SEM samples, the thickness may be up to 1 cm3. Fixation was done in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Merck, USA) and 2% paraformaldehyde
(Merck, USA) made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (Merck, USA) buffer (pH
7.2). After that, the samples were dehydrated by ethanol series by
immersing in 50% and 70% ethanol for 10 min and in 100% ethanol for
20 min. After dehydration, the samples were gold coated and viewed
under a Zeiss EV040 scanning electron microscope.

FACS
The internal complexity in terms of granularity
of bacterial cells was measured by a flow cytometer (BD FACSVERSE,
BD Bioscience, USA) after treatment with increasing concentration
of heavy metal. The E. coli cells (109 cfu/mL) were grown overnight and treated with mercury at
a final concentration range of 1 to 105 ppb for 1 h. Then,
the forward and side scatterings of the treated cells were analyzed
by a flow cytometer. The untreated bacteria were used as the control
here.

Cell Killing Assay
LB agar plates were used to check
the growth of recombinant E. coli cells
after addition of mercury (Hg) at a broad range of concentrations
(1 to 105 ppb). All plates were incubated for 10 h followed
by colony counting for each plate. Four dilutions (10×, 100×,
1000×, and 10 000×) of bacterial culture were maintained
to get distinguished bacterial colonies. Colonies were counted manually.

Fluorescence Quenching of EmGFP Due to Mercury
To check
the fluorescence quenching of EmGFP by mercury, fluorescent spectroscopy
was performed. Purified EmGFP was kept in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, 0.01 M, pH = 7.4) buffer. Purified green fluorescent protein
(EmGFP) was incubated with mercury at different concentrations to
check the quenching effect of the EmGFP expression. The protein (1
μg) was incubated with different concentrations from 1 to 105 ppb for 1 h of incubation time.

pH Effect
Hg solutions
were made in three pH buffers:
first was in very low pH (1 because of HNO3), second in
pH 4, and third in neutral pH 7. All pH conditions were used to take
fluorescence data to compare.

Removal of Excess Hg Using
EDTA as the Chelating Agent
EDTA was used to chelate the
excess amount of Hg in the solution.
Different concentrations (1, 10, 15, and 100 mM) of EDTA were used.
Out of these concentrations, significant data was obtained at a 15
mM concentration of EDTA.

for mercury, luminescence measured by mercury concentration-dependent
induction and expression with pRLucMer19 plasmid using cell-free transcription
and translation kit, EmGFP expression and its measurements using fluorescence
spectroscopy when induced with different cations (Hg2+,
Cu2+, and Cd2+) at 100 μM concentration
to whole-cell and cell-free biosensors, dot plot of forward and side
scatterings of treated (with mercury) and untreated samples, dot plot
of forward and side scatterings of treated (with mercury concentration
of 105 ppb) samples, scanning electron micrographs for
mercury incubated different cells, bacterial cell killing assay with
an initial increase (up to 10 ppb) followed by a decrease (up to 105 ppb) in a number of bacterial cells, effect of pH on GFP
expression shown at low pH (1.5) and neutral pH (7) as neutralization
of the pH was done, and recovery of the EmGFP fluorescence even at
higher concentration (104 ppb) of Hg (PDF)
