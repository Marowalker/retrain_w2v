Hydrogen bonding interaction plays
a crucial role in liquid systems.
Methanol, ethanol, and acetone are the most commonly used solvents
to extract isoflavones from soybeans. The structural and electronic
properties of the molecular clusters of naturally occurring glycitein
with solvents were investigated using the density functional theory
method employing the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ approach. The influence of the
solvent was carried out by using the polarized continuum model (PCM).
The geometry optimization, vibrational frequencies, and topological
parameters have been assessed at the same level of theory. From the
molecular structure and thermodynamic point of view, the most stable
structures are formed by the interaction between the carbonyl group
of glycitein and MeOH or EtOH. For acetone–glycitein, the strongest
interaction is formed by the interaction of the hydroxyl group of
glycitein with the carbonyl group of acetone. All the hydrogen bonds
in the MeOH/EtOH/acetone–glycitein complexes are closed-shell
interactions. This study can help increase the efficiency of extraction.

1 Introduction
Soybeans
contain a wide range of isoflavones, such as daidzein,
glycitein, genistein, and so forth. Soy isoflavones are naturally
occurring polyphenol compounds and structurally similar to estradiol.
Soybeans contain 3 mg g–1 (dry weight) of isoflavones.1 Meanwhile, isoflavones are similar to the antioxidant
flavonoids that are found in other vegetables, plants, and flowers.
Among all the soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein are the major
portions of isoflavones in soybeans. Daidzein and genistein from soybeans
are a source of phytoestrogens for humans. On the other hand, most
of the natural estrogenic substances show weak activities. As a result,
they have been widely investigated for their important health-enhancing
properties such as prevention of sex hormone-dependent cancer, improvement
of bone health, and so forth.2 For instance,
genistein has many health benefits as an antioxidant, inhibitor to
regulate cell divisions and cells survival, antiangiogenetic agent,
and so forth.3,4 Their estrogenic activities have
been demonstrated to bind to estrogen receptors from different animals,
such as mice, rats, sheep, and so forth.5

Meanwhile, glycitein (C16H12O5, 7,4′-dihydroxy-6-methoxyisoflavone) is about 5–10%
of the total soy isoflavones.6 Thus, it
is essential to assess the chemical and physical activity of glycitein.
One of the studies showed that glycitein is much weaker in estrogenic
activity than other soy isoflavones.1 In
contrast, glycitein actually has a stronger estrogenic response on
an equal amount basis in the mice uterine enlargement assay.7 However, there are a variety of impurities in
soy which can influence the quality of the isoflavones during production.
Therefore, removal of the impurities below the acceptable level is
required. One of the commonly employed separation method is extraction,
and isoflavones are normally extracted from foods with methanol, ethanol,
acetonitrile, and so forth.8−10 The extraction can be carried
out either at room temperature or above.11 Meanwhile, hydrogen bonding interactions between solute and polar
organic solvents play a crucial role in the extraction reaction.12 However, few studies have been focused on the
extraction mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
are one of the effective methods to obtain the conformation, electronic
structures, and inter/intramolecular interactions of isoflavones,
such as daidzein, genistein, and so forth.13,14 On the other hand, the intermolecular interaction in solvents, namely,
hydrogen bonding interaction, has a great influence on the extraction
process.15 The main aim of this study is
to calculate the hydrogen bonding interaction between glycitein and
methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), or acetone in the extraction reaction
from a theoretical point of view.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Conformational Analysis
The framework
and atom numbering of glycitein are presented in Figure 1. There are two phenyl rings
(I and III) and one heterocyclic ring (II) in glycitein. They contain several functional groups:
−OCH3, −OH, and −C=O. The optimization
of the glycitein monomer at the B3LYP-D3 DFT functional level converged
to eight different conformers when one rotates the −OaCH3, −ObHb, or −OeHe functional groups (Figure 2). Then, it can be noticed that all the eight
conformers have nonplanar structures, and they can be divided into
two groups: Ob–Hb···Oa intramolecular hydrogen bonded structures (Figure 2, A, B) and non-hydrogen-bonded
structures (Figure 2, C–H). Meanwhile, there is a torsion angle between the II and III rings as seen in Figure 1. In a previous study, the
conformational absolute minimum of glycitein by rotating the II and III rings was found with a torsion angle
of 40° (B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)).16 In this
study, the torsion angles were calculated to be 40.9°–41.9°
for all eight conformers. As a result, the coplanarity between the II and III rings is lost, whereas the coplanarity
remains between the I and II rings. In the
most stable conformers [glycitein (A) and glycitein (B), Figure 2], the hydroxyl group
Ob–Hb interacts with the Oa carbonyl atom to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond. This makes
the glycitein (A) and glycitein (B) conformers at least ∼19
kJ mol–1 more stable than the non-hydrogen-bonded
conformers. Meanwhile, the geometric difference between glycitein
(A) and glycitein (B) is the orientation of the −OeHe group. Glycitein (A) is only slightly about 0.8 kJ
mol–1 more stable than glycitein (B). In contrast,
the rotational barrier between the two conformers is much higher about
14.3 kJ mol–1. However, different orientations of
the −OeHe group are unlikely to affect
the relative stability of the molecular interaction between glycitein
and various solvents in this work, and the strongest interaction is
the one between carbonyl oxygen and solvents. Meanwhile, the EtOH
monomer has two conformers: a trans-conformer and
a gauche-conformer.17 The gauche-conformer is about 0.3 kJ mol–1 [B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ, corrected with zero-point vibrational energy
(ZPVE)] more stable than the trans-conformer. Thus,
only the most stable glycitein (A) and the gauche-EtOH conformer will be used to study the molecular interaction in
this study. The notations “glycitein” and “EtOH”
in the following text will refer to glycitein (A) and gauche-EtOH, respectively.

level. Relative electronic energies are listed.

Glycitein interacts with solvents (such as MeOH, EtOH, and acetone)
during extraction as either a hydrogen bond acceptor or a hydrogen
bond donor. When it acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor, there are five
different docking sites for the hydrogen atom of MeOH, that is, Oa, Ob, Oc, Od, and Oe (Figure 1). The labels
of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms are in white, gray, and red
colors, respectively. The Ob atom together with the Oe atom belongs to the hydroxyl groups of the glycitein molecule.
The Ob and Od atoms, on the other hand, belong
to an ether group while Oc is derived from a carbonyl group.
As a hydrogen bond donor, the two hydroxyl groups, −ObHb, and −OeHe, can donate
their hydrogen atoms to a hydrogen bond acceptor, such as acetone.
The most stable structures of the MeOH–glycitein complexes
at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ level are presented in Figure 3. The MeOH molecule acts as a hydrogen bond
donor and acceptor in MeOH–glycitein (A). MeOH is the hydrogen
bond donor approaching to glycitein in MeOH–glycitein (B–E),
while MeOH is the hydrogen bond acceptor in MeOH–glycitein
(F). The binding energy (BE) is one of the most effective indicators
to reveal the relative stability of a structure. BE of a stable interacted
complex is often negative. The lower BE means a stronger molecular
interaction. Meanwhile, ZPVEs are quite large about 4.6–6.6
kJ mol–1 for the studied systems, and basis set
superposition errors (BSSEs) vary from 6.8 to 9.9 kJ mol–1 (Table S1, Supporting Information). The
binding energies in Figure 3 were calculated at ambient conditions (298.15 K and 1 atm)
at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ level and corrected with ZPVE and BSSE. Based
on the binding energies, the strength as a hydrogen bond acceptor
can be sorted as Oc > Ob > Oe > Oa > Od. This indicates that the carbonyl
oxygen
is the best hydrogen bond acceptor, and this is in line with previous
studies: (i) the O–H···O=C (carbonyl
oxygen) hydrogen bonding interactions are about 9.6–11.0 kJ
mol–1 (B3LYP/6-31+G(d)) more favorable than the
O–H···O (ester oxygen) hydrogen bonding interaction
in the MeOH−α-hydroxyester systems, where α-hydroxyester
is methyl glycolate, methyl lactate, or methyl α-hydroxyisobutyrate;18 (ii) the O–H···O=C
(carbonyl oxygen) hydrogen bonding interaction is about 9.7 kJ mol–1 also more stable than the corresponding O–H···O
(ester oxygen) hydrogen bonding interaction in the MeOH–methyl
lactate system.19 All these imply that
the most favorite docking site for the incoming MeOH is the carbonyl
group oxygen Oc.

the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ level. BEs (corrected with ZPVE and BSSE) are
given in brackets. Hydrogen bonds between MeOH and glycitein are represented
by dashed lines. The labels of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms
are in white, gray, and red colors, respectively.

Meanwhile, the strength as a hydrogen bond donor is sorted as OeHe > OaHa. Thus, for the
EtOH–glycitein and acetone–glycitein systems, only the
most stable structures formed between EtOH/acetone and the Oc or OeHe group of glycitein were studied. The
most stable structures of the EtOH–glycitein and acetone–glycitein
complexes at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ level are presented in Figure 4. This demonstrates
that the driving force for extracting glycitein is the hydrogen bonding
interaction between the solvent (a hydrogen bond donor, such as MeOH
and EtOH) and carbonyl oxygen Oc of glycitein, or between
the solvent (a hydrogen bond acceptor, such as acetone) and the hydroxyl
group OeHe of glycitein.

lines.

2.2 Solvent
Effects and Their Influence on the
Hydrogen Bond
In order to study the effects of solvents on
the electronic energies, geometrical parameters, and IR frequencies
of the glycitein-containing complexes, the most stable conformers
of the MeOH–glycitein, EtOH–glycitein, and acetone–glycitein
structures were fully optimized within the polarizable continuum model
(PCM) at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ level of theory. The calculated geometrical
parameters and interaction energies of the most stable conformers
of MeOH–glycitein, EtOH–glycitein, and acetone–glycitein
in different solvents are present in Table 1. The relative permittivity (ε) values
of acetone, ethanol, and methanol are 20.493, 24.852, and 32.613,
respectively.20 The structure is stabilized
in the solvent, and it is due to immersion in the solvent. The stabilized
energy (ΔES) can be calculated as
follows 1  where E(solvent) is the electronic energy in the solvent, and E(gas) is the electronic energy in the gas phase.
Meanwhile,
the major components of the hydrogen bonding interaction energy are
electrostatic and charge-transfer; thus, the effect of the solvent
polarity on the hydrogen bond is expected.21 In this study, the polarity of the solvent plays an important role
in extraction, and this is due to the hydroxyl groups of glycitein.
MeOH–glycitein is stabilized by 38.2 kJ mol–1 (in the MeOH solvent), 37.5 kJ mol–1 (in the EtOH
solvent), and 36.8 kJ mol–1 (in the acetone solvent)
as compared with the electronic energy in the gas phase, whereas the
EtOH–glycitein complex is stabilized by 37.4–38.8 kJ
mol–1 in the three solvents. In contrast, the acetone–glycitein
complex is favored by 44.2–45.7 kJ mol–1 in
the three solvents. It should be mentioned that the dipole moments
of the three complexes were found to be 1.86, 2.87, and 5.96 D for
MeOH–glycitein, EtOH–glycitein, and acetone–glycitein,
respectively, at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ level of theory (gas phase).
To summarize, the PCM model indicates that acetone–glycitein
is stabilized more than EtOH–glycitein and MeOH–glycitein.
This is due to the higher dipole moment of the former when the solvent
effects of MeOH, EtOH, and acetone solvents were taken into account.
For the glycitein-containing complexes, BEs were obtained at −39.1
to −36.2 kJ mol–1 in the gas phase. This
is much more stable than some MeOH-containing hydrogen bonded systems
(gas phase), where MeOH–dimethylamine (DMA), MeOH–trimethylamine
(TMA), and MeOH–dimethylether (DME) were obtained to be about
−21.2 to −19.7 kJ mol–1 (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ).22,23 Meanwhile, BEs were calculated to be −34.6 to −32.7
kJ mol–1 in the three solvents. This means that
the monomers in the three solvents bind to each other slightly less
favored than the monomers in the gas phase bind to each other.

kJ mol–1. Δṽ = ṽmonomer – ṽdimer (in
cm–1). Δr(OH) = rdimer – rmonomer (in Å), is the change in the OH bond length upon complexation.
QTAIM parameters [ΔE(H), ρ(BCP), ∇2ρ(BCP)] are given in au. Dipole moment is given in debye.

The OH-stretching vibrational
frequencies of MeOH, EtOH, and glycitein
monomers are red-shifted (Δṽ = ṽmonomer – ṽdimer) by about 11–20 cm–1 in
the three solvents when compared with the values in the gas phase.
The corresponding OH bond lengths are increased by 0.001–0.002
Å in the three solvents. Meanwhile, the C=O stretching
vibrational frequencies of acetone and glycitein are also red-shifted
by 36–56 cm–1 in the solvent, and the C=O
bond distances are elongated by 0.006–0.007 Å in the three
solvents as well. On the other hand, there is a change in the hydrogen
bond length during complexation. Thus, it leads to a red shift between
the free and the hydrogen-bonded vibrational transitions. The quantity
of red shift is commonly used to justify the relative strength of
the hydrogen bonding interaction.24,25 The B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ-calculated
red shifts of the OH-stretching fundamental transition upon complexation
and the corresponding changes of the OH bond are listed in Table 1. The red shifts of
the OH-stretching vibrational frequencies are 255–298 cm–1 in the gas phase as compared with the monomer (gas
phase). The corresponding red shifts are significantly increased to
282–428 cm–1 in the three solvents. This
is because the strength of the hydrogen bond dramatically increases
in the three solvents. Upon complexation, the changes of the OH bond
length of the glycitein-containing complexes vary from 0.012 to 0.020
Å. These are similar with the previous studies in the O–H···O
hydrogen bonded system. In the study of the MeOH–DMA and MeOH–TMA
complexes (gas phase), the OH bond lengths in the O–H···O
hydrogen bonds were calculated to be elongated by 0.016–0.018
Å during complexation.22 However,
the NH bond distances in the N–H···N hydrogen
bonds (gas phase) were only increased by 0.003–0.004 Å
(QCISD/aug-cc-pVTZ) in DMA–DMA and 0.005 Å [CCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12]
in DMA–TMA upon hydrogen bond formation.25,26 Consequently, comparable red shifts were also found in MeOH-containing
complexes (gas phase): MeOH–TMA (333 cm–1, local mode model), MeOH–DME (234 cm–1,
B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ), and MeOH–DMA (301 cm–1, local mode model).22,23

The most stable conformers
of glycitein and MeOH–glycitein
in both the gas phase and the MeOH solvent were used to simulate the
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra. The
first 200 singlet → singlet spin-allowed excited states were
calculated, and the max absorption wavelengths λmax, the electronic excitation energies, and the oscillator strengths f were obtained using time-dependent (TD)-DFT at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ
level. The simulated 200–350 nm UV–vis spectra are displayed
in Figure 5. The simulated
spectra were formed because of the electronic transitions from the
highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) to the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbitals (LUMOs). The five important frontier molecular
orbitals of glycitein (in the MeOH solvent): HOMO – 2, HOMO
– 1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO + 1, are illustrated in Figure 6. It is clear that
the five frontier molecular orbitals are the π and π*
molecular orbitals locating at the I, II, and III rings of glycitein (in the MeOH solvent).
One can notice that it is the π → π* transitions
taking place in the UV–vis region with high extinction coefficients.
The max absorption wavelengths λmax of glycitein
were calculated to be 271.63 nm (gas phase) and 270.49 nm (in the
MeOH solvent). The max absorption wavelengths λmax of MeOH–glycitein were calculated to be 271.62 nm (gas phase)
and 273.54 nm (in the MeOH solvent). Moreover, the experimental UV–vis
spectral data for glycitein were λmax 257 nm (in
the MeOH solvent).1 Our calculated λmax is slightly larger than the experimental value, and this
may be due to the DFT method used which overestimates the UV–vis
spectra. Moreover, our calculations show that the max absorption is
mainly formed by three excitations: +0.66(HOMO → LUMO + 1),
+0.14(HOMO – 1 → LUMO + 1), and 0.15(HOMO – 1
→ LUMO). The interacting site in MeOH–glycitein is the
carbonyl group of glycitein. The interaction only has a slight effect
on the π and π* molecular orbitals located at the I, II, and III rings of glycitein.
Thus, the max absorption wavelength is only marginally influenced
by the hydrogen bonding interaction.

2.3 Nature of Hydrogen Bond: Quantum Theory of
Atoms in Molecules Analysis
The topological quantum theory
of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) was unitized to analyze the chemical
bond between two neighboring atoms. Then, the parameters to describe
the nature of a chemical bond, such as, bond critical points (BCPs),
ring critical points (RCPs), cage critical points (CCPs), electron
density ρ(r) and Laplacian ∇2ρ(r) at BCPs, and atomic charge Δq(H) and atomic energy [ΔE(H)] of
the hydrogen bond donor atom, were calculated with the AIM2000 program
package. The QTAIM topological plots of the most stable MeOH–glycitein,
EtOH–glycitein, and acetone–glycitein conformers with
BCPs, RCPs, and electron density paths are displayed in Figure 7. The corresponding parameters
in the gas phase and the solvents are listed in Table 1. Moreover, the strength of a hydrogen bond
can be classified as follows: (a) weak hydrogen bond: ΔE(H) < 0.019 au, ∇2ρ(r) > 0; (b) medium hydrogen bond: 0.019 au < ΔE(H) < 0.038 au, ∇2ρ(r) > 0; and (c) strong hydrogen bond: ΔE(H) > 0.038 au, ∇2ρ(r) <
0.27

Figure 7 QTAIM topological plots of the most stable
MeOH–glycitein,
EtOH–glycitein, and acetone–glycitein conformers (gas
phase) obtained at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ level. The BCPs, RCPs, and
CCP are represented by the red, yellow, and green balls, respectively.

As seen in Table 1, the Laplacian of total electronic densities, ∇2ρ(r), at BCPs are all positive, 0.137–0.177
au. This indicates that the electronic charges are depleted in the
interatomic path. Thus, the hydrogen bonding interactions are classified
as closed-shell molecular interactions. According to the abovementioned
classification, the O–H···Oc and
Oe–He···O hydrogen bonds
are strong hydrogen bonds [ΔE(H) = 0.041–0.061
au] in both the solvents and the gas phase. Moreover, the strengths
of the studied hydrogen bonds increase in solvents. However, the dielectric
constants of the three solvents are very close to each other, so the
increase in the strength of the hydrogen bond seems very close in
the three solvents as well.

For a hydrogen bond, the electron
density ρ(BCP) and the
Laplacian of charge density ∇2ρ(BCP) at BCPs
should be in the range 0.002–0.040 au and 0.014–0.139
au, respectively.28,29 For the studied systems in Table 1, ρ(BCP) and
∇2ρ(BCP) were calculated to be in the ranges
0.024–0.028 and 0.137–0.177 au, respectively. However,
the ∇2ρ(BCP) values are higher than the upper
range of the Laplacian criteria for a hydrogen bond.28,29 The ∇2ρ(BCP) values for the interactions
between benzoic acid/cis-pinonic acid–sulfuric
acid were also calculated to be exceeding the upper range of hydrogen
bond criteria.30 This is due to the formation
of strong hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, there is also a charge
transfer (CT) when a hydrogen-bonded complex is formed, leading to
a decreased charge on the hydrogen atom.31 The quantity of CT reveals a part of the stabilization energy of
the hydrogen bonded system, and it determines the electron delocalization
interaction between the two interacted systems.32 This means that the more electron transfer it does, the
more stable the system is. In this study, there are about 0.09–0.11
electrons from the hydrogen bond acceptor to the donor. The results
of Δq(H) demonstrate that the hydrogen bond
strengths in the gas phase are greater than the ones in the solvent.

3 Concluding Remark
In the present study, DFT
has been used to investigate the naturally
occurring isoflavonoid compound, glycitein. The hydrogen bonds were
analyzed using the B3LYP-D3 level of theory at the cc-pVTZ basis set.
The effects of various solvents (methanol, ethanol, and acetone) on
the hydrogen bond between glycitein and various solvents were investigated.
This study aimed to determine the electronic energies, geometric parameters,
solvent effects, and so forth of the molecules in question. The results
obtained from DFT and the topological parameters suggest that the
most stable clusters are found to be stabilized by hydrogen bonds
formed with the hydroxyl group of glycitein and the carbonyl group
of acetone or with the carbonyl group of glycitein and MeOH/EtOH.
The UV–vis adsorption spectra were calculated with TD-DFT to
investigate the electronic properties. The analysis of the solvent
effect demonstrated that the polar solvent stabilizes the complexes.
The changes of the OH bond lengths are larger in the three solvents
because of the polar environments.

4 Methodology
All the computations have been performed using the Gaussian 09
Revision E.01 software package20 Because
of the excellent computational time and electronic properties (such
as electronic structures, vibrational frequencies, and so forth),
the DFT method has been used. The B3LYP-D3 approach was carried out.
This approach is a hybrid functional of the DFT method, and it contains
the Becke’s three-parameter nonlocal exchange functional with
the correlation functional of the Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP)
method and the Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction.33 Previous studies on small hydrogen-bonded molecular
clusters were found to offer very accurate electronic energetics,
vibrational frequencies, structural information, and so forth.24,34−38 Moreover, the Dunning’s correlation consistent triple-zeta
basis set (cc-pVTZ) was used throughout the computational process.
Vibrational frequencies of the optimized structures were computed
at the same level of theory to confirm the nature of stationary points.
The corresponding ZPVE correction and thermodynamic corrections were
added to electronic energies. Meanwhile, BSSE was added to BEs by
using the typical counterpoise method.39 For UV–vis calculations, the electronic maximum absorption
wavelengths λmax of glycitein and MeOH–glycitein
in the MeOH solvent were computed using the TD-DFT method at the B3LYP-D3/cc-pVTZ
level.

Several different solutions (methanol, ethanol, and acetone)
to
investigate the influence of the solvent on hydrogen bonds were used,
and the corresponding effects were compared with those in the gas
phase. The solvation effects were calculated considering the cavity
of series of spheres by the aid of the means of the self-consistent
reaction field method with the integral equation formalism variant
model.40 The analysis of the electronic
charge density (ρ), its Laplacian ∇2ρ
at BCPs, changes in atomic charge Δq(H), and
changes of atomic energy ΔE(H) at the H atom
was performed by making use of the theory of molecular structure to
investigate the nature of hydrogen bonds. The topological QTAIM was
performed using the “output = WFN” option for the AIM
keyword as implemented in Gaussian 09 Revision E.01 and AIM2000 software.
