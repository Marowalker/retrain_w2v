In
this study, bare CdS nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by solvothermal
method using CdCl2(3-methylbenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone)2 as a single-source molecular precursor in the presence of
ethylene glycol. Further, these CdS NPs were used for the preparation
of binary (CdS–TiO2) and ternary (CdS–TiO2/Pd) heterogeneous nanocatalysts. Characterization of the
as-prepared nanocatalysts has been carried out using different techniques
such as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–visible diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence studies. The peak
observed at 2θ = 39.5° in XRD confirms the successful doping
of noble metal (Pd) on the surface of CdS–TiO2 nanocatalyst,
which is well supported by Raman analysis. From FESEM and TEM analyses,
mixed morphology has been observed and elemental composition was confirmed
by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping. Furthermore,
the as-prepared bare CdS NPs, binary CdS–TiO2, and
ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd heterogeneous nanocatalysts
were used for the reductive transformation of various nitroaromatic
compounds to their corresponding aromatic amines at room temperature.
It has been observed that among all of the catalysts, ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd heterogeneous nanocatalyst has excellent catalytic property
to reduce all nitroaromatic compounds in very short time span.

1 Introduction
Over
the past few decades, pollutants from organic compounds such
as nitroaromatic compounds and organic dyes have drastically increased
due to the growth in industrialization. These industries include pigment,
dye, explosive, fungicidal, plastic, pharmaceutical, and pesticide
industries. Wastewater contains a large amount of organic and inorganic
pollutants, which are directly released into the aquatic environment.1−5 The derivatives of nitroaromatic compounds are highly toxic, more
stable in aqueous solution, and are not easily degradable. Therefore,
they are very harmful to the environment as well as human health.
Due to the properties of amino derivatives such as low stability,
low toxicity, and high biodegradation rate, the reduction of nitroaromatic
compounds into aminoaromatic compounds becomes very essential.6−8 Further, aromatic amino derivatives are very important industrial
intermediates for pharmaceuticals, anticorrosion, dyestuffs, agrochemicals,
etc.9−14

Earlier, researchers have carried out selective conversion
of nitroaromatic
derivatives into their aminoaromatic derivatives using noble-metal
catalysts, such as Pt, Ag, Au, Pd, etc.15−19 Also, use of many transition metals such as Co, Ni,
Cu, and Fe along with reducing agents like sodium borohydrate, hydrazine
hydrate, formic acid, hydrosilane, etc., which exhibit high catalytic
activity for the conversion of nitroaromatic derivatives, has been
reported.9,18,20−26 Noble-metal-based catalysts have shown excellent catalytic activity
toward nitro reduction compared to transition-metal catalysts at ambient
condition. However, the use of noble-metal nanoparticles (NPs) as
a catalyst increases the cost of the material and its ease of aggregation
hinders the large-scale industrial applications.1,5,27−29 To overcome this problem,
fabrication of noble-metal-based transition-metal heterogeneous catalysts
is found to be very selective for transformation of nitro derivatives
into their corresponding amino derivatives. Some of the examples are
Au/CeO2, Pd/ZnO, Pd/rGO/Fe3O4, Au/TiO2, Au/Fe3O4, Pd-P25-OV, and Ag/Fe3O4. To date, various noble- and non-noble-metal-based
transition-metal oxide semiconductors such as CuCo2O4/RGO, Fe3O4@Cu, Cu2O/TiO2, etc. have been reported for the reduction of nitroaromatic
compounds to their corresponding aminoaromatic compounds.7,13,28,30−35

In view of the above discussion, it is apparent that the catalyst
containing a noble-metal and transition-metal oxide/sulfide can be
a better choice for such kind of organic transformations. Therefore,
in the present investigation, a ternary heterogeneous nanocatalyst
which includes metal oxide (TiO2-n-type) and metal sulfide
(CdS-p-type) along with noble metal (Pd) has been designed, for the
reduction of nitroaromatic derivatives to their respective aminoaromatic
derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, nitro reduction using ternary
(CdS–TiO2/Pd) heterogeneous nanocatalyst has not
been studied yet. In the present work, the synthesis of ternary heterogeneous
nanocatalyst (CdS–TiO2/Pd) was carried out by two-step
solvothermal route. The use of solvothermal method for the synthesis
of bare nanoparticles as well as binary and ternary nanocomposites
has been reported in the literature by various researchers.36−38 Further, it has been used for the reduction of nitroaromatic derivatives
to respective amines at room temperature (RT) using NaBH4 as a reducing agent.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Precursor
The
precursor CdCl2(3-MebenztsczH)2 was prepared
by reacting CdCl2 with 3-methylbenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone
and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy techniques.

The IR spectra of precursor and ligand are shown in Figures S1 and S2, respectively. The bands at 3319 and 3300
cm–1 in the spectrum of complex are assigned to
υNH2 assym and sym vibrations, respectively,
whereas the band at 3164 cm–1 is attributed to υNH. The bands at 1560 and 950 cm–1 are due
to υC=N and υC=S,
respectively. The band due to υC=N at 1560
cm–1 is found to be at lower wavenumber compared
to the band observed in the ligand spectrum at 1599 cm–1. Figures S3 and S4 show the 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of the precursor.
In the proton NMR, a singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to methyl protons,
whereas a multiplet in the region 7.1–8.2 ppm is due to −C6H5 + NH2 groups. NH– proton is
observed at 11.4 ppm. In the 13C{1H} NMR spectra,
the signals due to >C=S and >C=N are observed
at 177.7
and 142.7 ppm, respectively. The aromatic ring carbon atoms are observed
in the region 138.2–124.5 ppm. The −CH3 group
signal is observed at 20.5 ppm.

2.2 Phase
and Structural Features
2.2.1 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Analysis
Figure 1 shows the
XRD patterns of bare TiO2 (a), CdS (b), CdS–TiO2 (c), and CdS–TiO2/Pd (d) nanocatalysts.
The bare TiO2 NPs show the peaks at 2θ = 25.02, 37.7,
48.0, 55.3, and 62.7° with (101), (004), (200), (211), and (204)
planes, respectively, indicating the anatase phase of TiO2 NPs (JCPDS File No. 021-1272). The peaks observed at 2θ =
24.7, 26.5, 28.3, 36.6, 43.9, 47.9, and 51.8° corresponding to
(100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) planes clearly
indicate the successful formation of hexagonal bare CdS NPs (JCPDS
File No. 041-1049), as shown in Figure 1b. Further, Figure 1c shows the sharp intense diffraction peaks of CdS–TiO2 catalyst similar to those of bare hexagonal CdS NPs (JCPDS
File No. 041-1049) along with diffraction peaks of TiO2 (JCPDS File No. 021-1272). The diffraction peaks due to CdS–TiO2 cannot be distinguished as they overlap with each other.
However, an additional peak at 2θ = 39.5° with (111) plane
of Pd (JCPDS File No. 046-1043) is observed in the pattern of CdS–TiO2/Pd ternary nanocatalyst, which corresponds to metallic Pd
(Figure 1d). This confirms
the formation of CdS–TiO2/Pd ternary nanocatalyst.39 The average crystallite size calculated using
the Scherrer formula40 is found to be 30.12
nm for (b), 27.81 nm for (c), and 27.69 nm for (d).

TiO2 NPs (a), bare CdS NPs (b),

2.2.2 FTIR spectroscopy
Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of
bare CdS NPs and their binary and ternary heterogeneous nanocatalysts.
The bands observed at 673, 619, and 574 cm–1 are
assigned to Cd–S stretching in the case of as-prepared bare
CdS NPs and their binary and ternary heterogeneous nanocatalysts,
respectively. Similarly, the Ti–O vibration peaks are observed
in the vicinity of 400–800 cm–1 for the as-prepared
binary and ternary nanocatalysts.41−44

CdS–TiO2 (b), and ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd (c) heterogeneous
nanocatalysts.

2.3 Shape
and Morphology of Nanocatalysts
Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
studies were performed to determine the shape, elemental details,
and morphology of the as-prepared nanocatalysts. Figure S5 shows the FESEM image of bare CdS nanoparticles. Figures 3 and 4 show the FESEM images of binary and ternary nanocatalysts
along with their elemental mapping. In all of the cases, mixed spherical–triangular
morphology is observed. From elemental mapping, the presence of Cd,
S, Ti, and O is seen (Figure 3). However, along with these elements, the presence of Pd
is also observed in the elemental mapping of ternary nanocatalyst
(Figure 4). The energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDAX) spectra of binary and ternary nanocatalysts and their
corresponding atomic weight percentages (inset) are shown in Figures S6 and S7,
respectively. Figure 5 shows the TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
patterns of the binary nanocatalysts. The TEM images along with SAED
pattern, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and histogram of the as-prepared
ternary nanocatalysts are shown in Figure 6. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image confirms
the coexistence of CdS, TiO2, and Pd. The three prominent
lattice fringes with spacings of 0.25, 0.24, and 0.20 nm correspond
to (102), (004), and (200) crystal planes of CdS, TiO2,
and Pd respectively. From the histogram, it is observed that the maximum
average number of as-prepared ternary nanocatalysts is in the range
of 5–9 nm.

2.4 Optical Properties
2.4.1 UV–Vis
Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
(DRS)
Figure 7A,B shows the UV–vis DRS images of as-prepared bare CdS NPs
(a), binary CdS–TiO2 (b), and ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd (c) nanocatalysts and their corresponding band gaps. The
as-prepared nanocatalyst shows a broad visible absorption in the region
450–600 nm. It has been observed that the absorption bands
of CdS–TiO2/Pd and CdS–TiO2 are
slightly red-shifted compared to bare CdS NPs. This shift toward the
visible region may be due to the photosensitizing effects of Pd and
CdS.45 The optical energy band gap of as-prepared
nanocatalysts was calculated using Tauc’s plot.46 The optical band gap of bare CdS NPs is calculated
to be 2.28 eV, binary CdS–TiO2 is 2.25 eV, while
for the ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd nanocatalyst, it is
observed to be 2.21 eV. With introduction of noble-metal Pd in ternary
nanocatalyst, the decrease in the indirect band gap was observed because
Pd-induced materials are more active materials than CdS–TiO2 and bare CdS NPs.

energy band gaps

(a), binary CdS–TiO2 (b), and ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd (c) nanocatalysts.

2.4.2 Photoluminescence (PL)
Photoluminescence
totally depends on electron–hole pair recombination. Generally,
the phenomenon takes place as lower the electron–hole pair
recombination, lower is the PL intensity and higher is the photocatalytic
activity.47,48 The PL spectra of the as-prepared bare CdS
NPs (a), binary (CdS–TiO2) (b), and ternary (CdS–TiO2/Pd) (c) nanocatalysts excited at 350 nm are shown in Figure 8. Compared to the
intensity of bare CdS NPs, it has been observed that CdS–TiO2 nanocatalysts have a slightly lower intensity, whereas ternary
CdS–TiO2/Pd has the lowest intensity of them all,
indicating that the electron–hole pair recombination is reduced
effectively as the lifetimes of photogenerated carriers are elongated
due to the synergistic effect of CdS and Pd.45,46,49

CdS NPs (a), binary

2.5 Raman
Analysis
The Raman spectra
of as-prepared bare CdS NPs are shown in Figure S8, while those of binary (CdS–TiO2) and
ternary (CdS–TiO2/Pd) nanocomposites are presented
in Figure 9. The strong
peaks observed at 302 and 593 cm–1 belong to CdS
nanoparticles 1LO and 2LO bands, respectively. The Raman band observed
at 287, 609 (for CdS), 141, 387 and 501 cm–1 (for
anatase TiO2) correspond to CdS–TiO2 binary
nanocomposites (Figure 9a). Similarly, the peaks observed at 290, 609 (for CdS), 144, 390,
and 503 cm–1 (for TiO2) can be attributed
to ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd nanocomposites (Figure 9b). The absence of
sharp peak at 640 cm–1 (for PdO) indicates that
only Pd is doped on the surface of CdS–TiO2.36,50−54

2.6 Catalytic Reduction of
Nitro Compounds
The catalytic reduction of nitro compounds
was carried out in a quartz
cuvette at RT and monitored using a UV–vis spectrophotometer,
as shown in Figure 10. The catalytic activities of bare CdS NPs, CdS–TiO2, and CdS–TiO2/Pd nanocatalysts were evaluated
for the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds such as 4-nitrophenol
(4-NP), 2-nitrophenol (2-NP), 4-nitroaniline (4-NA), 2-nitroaniline
(2-NA), and O-nitrophenylenediamine (O-NPDA). The UV–vis spectra
for all nitroaromatic compounds were recorded in the presence of NaBH4 (without catalyst), and it has been proved that there is
no drastic effect of NaBH4 on the reduction of nitro compounds,
as shown in Figure S9a–e; however,
after introducing a small amount of as-prepared ternary heterogeneous
nanocatalyst, the catalytic reduction takes place in a very short
time span. The reduction of 2-NP to 2-AP in the presence of as-prepared
ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd heterogeneous nanocatalyst shows
absorption peak at 420 nm indicating the formation of 2-nitrophenolate
ion, which was further diminished within 2 min resulting in the formation
of new absorption peak at 291 nm, confirming the successful reduction
of 2-NP to 2-NA. Similarly, the reduction of 4-NP, 2-NA, 4-NA, and
O-NPDA using as-prepared ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd heterogeneous
nanocatalyst shows maximum absorption peaks at 400, 412, 380, and
398 nm, respectively, with the formation of their corresponding intermediates
(-phenolate ion), as shown in Figure 10a–e. For comparison, the catalytic reduction
of these nitro compounds was also performed for bare CdS NPs and binary
CdS–TiO2 nanocatalysts, which remain unaffected
even after 30 min, as shown in Figures S10a–e and S11a–e, respectively. It has been observed that
ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd heterogeneous nanocatalyst has
the highest catalytic activity for reduction of nitro compounds compared
to bare CdS and binary CdS–TiO2 nanocatalysts.

such as 2-NP (a), 4-NP (b), 2-NA (c), 4-NA (d), and O-NPDA (e), using
ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd heterogeneous nanocatalyst.

The graphs of C/C0 and ln(C/C0) vs time55,56 were plotted for as-prepared
ternary CdS–TiO2/Pd
heterogeneous nanocatalyst, where C is the concentration
at different time intervals and C0 is
the initial concentration, which are shown in Figure 11a,b. The rate constant (k) calculated using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood57 expression and the slopes of ln C/C0 observed show pseudo-first-order
kinetics for CdS–TiO2/Pd for all nitroaromatic compounds,
and the rate constants (k) are 0.1956, 0.0432, 0.3015,
0.1808, and 0.1845 min–1 for 2-NP, 4-NP, 2-NA, 4-NA,
and O-NPDA, respectively. Also the linear regression coefficients
(R2) are calculated and presented in Table 1.

2-NA	0.3015	0.97	
O-NPDA	0.2936	0.99	
The results obtained in the present work are compared
to those
reported in the literature as given in Table 2. It is observed that the as-prepared ternary
CdS–TiO2/Pd heterogeneous nanocatalyst prepared
in this work shows the highest catalytic activity in less time for
the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds compared to some of the catalytic
activities reported.

2.6.1 Mechanism
of Catalytic Reduction of Nitro
Derivatives
Figure 12 shows the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band
(CB) of TiO2 captured by Pd metal.67 Further, the holes left in the valence band (VB) of CdS flow to
Pd due to high Fermi energy level of Pd, where they recombine with
the stored electrons in Pd. Then, the electrons present in the CB
of CdS gives rise to reduction of nitroaromatic compounds. The higher
Fermi energy level of Pd leads to more charge separation between VB
of TiO2 and CB of CdS, resulting in more photocatalytic
activity of CdS–TiO2/Pd. The overall solid-state
Z-scheme system with CdS–TiO2/Pd heterogeneous nanocatalyst
supports the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation due
to the vectorial electron transfer of TiO2–CdS-Pd.67,68 The valance band (VB) and conduction band (CB) energy levels of
TiO2 and CdS are shown in Figure 12. The conduction bands of TiO2 and CdS are −4.2 and −3.9 eV (vs vacuum), respectively.69,70

2.7 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
The chemical compositions and states of CdS–TiO2/Pd were studied by XPS analysis. Figures 13 and 14 show the
XPS images of as-prepared CdS–TiO2/Pd nanocatalyst
before and after conversion of nitroaromatic compounds to aminoaromatic
compounds, respectively. The binding energies of chemical states of
elements Cd(3d5/2, 3d3/2), S(2p3/2, 2p1/2), Ti(2p3/2, 2p1/2), O(1s),
and Pd(3d5/2, 3d3/2) match well with the literature
values.71−75 In ternary nanocatalyst, the presence of all of the elements, Cd,
S, Ti, O, and Pd, can be seen before and after catalytic reduction
of nitroaromatic compounds.

In a two-neck round-bottom
flask, 0.05 g of presynthesized CdS NPs was taken in 50 mL of ethylene
glycol. This mixture was sonicated for 40 min and, further, it was
refluxed under stirring. During refluxing, 0.025 g of PdCl2 followed by a pinch of NaBH4 were added. Then, to the
above refluxing solution, 0.3 mL of titanium isopropoxide was added
dropwise using a syringe. The final reaction mixture was refluxed
at 200 °C for 2 h under inert atmosphere. After 2 h, the reaction
mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The obtained blackish
green product was washed (four to five times) and centrifuged using
methanol and dried under vacuum (Scheme 1).

3.6 Catalytic Reduction of
Nitroaromatic Compounds
In a typical experiment, aqueous
solution of nitroaromatic compounds
(1 mM, 200 μL) was taken in a quartz cuvette. To this, freshly
prepared NaBH4 (10 mM, 1 mL) solution was added. Further,
300 μL (0.001 g/mL) of catalyst was added to this reaction mixture
followed by 1 mL of deionized water. The progress of the reaction
was monitored by recording the absorption spectrum of reaction mixture
at room temperature using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450
PC Shimadzu) in the range of 200–800 nm. The reductive transformation
of 4-NP, 4-NA, 2-NP, 2-NA, and O-NPDA to their corresponding amines
was studied using bare, binary, and ternary nanocatalysts.

4 Conclusions
In summary, it is concluded that CdS–TiO2/Pd
ternary heterogeneous nanocatalyst has been successfully synthesized
via two-step solvothermal route in 2 h. Certainly, this catalyst plays
an important role in the reduction of nitroaromatic derivatives to
their corresponding aminoaromatic derivatives. The efficiency trends
were observed as: 2-NP > O-NPDA > 2-NA > 4-NA > 4-NP.
For comparison,
the nitro reduction was also carried out in the presence of bare CdS
and binary CdS–TiO2 catalysts under similar conditions
and they are found to be less effective for the reduction of nitroaromatic
compounds. Thus, it is found that CdS–TiO2/Pd is
the best heterogeneous nanocatalyst for the reduction of nitroaromatic
compounds, which can be attributed to large charge separation due
to the presence of palladium metal.
