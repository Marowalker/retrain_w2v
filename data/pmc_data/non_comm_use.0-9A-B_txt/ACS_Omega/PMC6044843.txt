To
identify novel antitrypanosomal agents based on Janadolide,
a potent macrocyclic polyketide–peptide hybrid, a macrolactonization
strategy was explored. We prepared des-tert-butyl
Janadolide and evaluated its antitrypanosomal activity. Our findings
suggest that the tert-butyl group is necessary for
the desired bioactivity.

Introduction
Parasitic infectious
diseases such as trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis
are a threat to human and animal health, mainly in tropical and subtropical
regions. Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), a neglected infectious
disease, is caused by protozoan parasite Trypanosoma
brucei. The current treatment for trypanosomiasis
includes suramin and pentamidine in the first phase, whereas melarsoprol,
nifurtimox, and eflornithine are used in the second phase of the disease.1 However, none of them is ideal, as they often
cause unwanted side effects and require lengthy treatment periods.
Moreover, the effectiveness of these drugs is compromised because
of emergence of drug resistance. Thus, there is a need for the development
of new chemotherapeutic agents to tackle this disease. In search of
compounds with unique structures, the Suenaga group isolated a very
potent antitrypanosomal natural product called Janadolide 1 from Okeania sp., which is a marine cyanobacterium.2 It is a 23-membered macrocyclic depsipetide and
a rare polyketide–peptide hybrid containing a tert-butyl group. A very few related polyketide–peptide natural
products, virginiamycin, surfactin, and streptogramins, were isolated
and characterized from the nature.3 The
absolute structure of 1 was determined with the help
of various spectral methods supported by degradation and chemical
modifications.2 As part of our broader
research activity on macrocyclic natural products,4 we became interested in the Janadolide scaffold, to access
the natural product and its analogues as possible antiparasitic lead(s).

Results
and Discussion
The planned strategy to access the Janadolide
natural product is
described in Scheme 1. We envisioned the target compound 1 through a macrolactonization
strategy5 from corresponding hydroxyl ester 2 in which all of the desired amino acids and functionalities
are in place. Hydroxy ester 2 could be accessed from
two key fragments, proline fragment 3 and tetrapeptide 4. Compound 3 was planned from 5 using stereoselective operations, which in turn
could be accessed by following documented procedures starting from
abundantly available geraniol. Tetrapeptide fragment 4 could be stitched using known amino acid derivatives.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic
Analysis
of Janadolide
Our synthesis commenced
with the preparation of fragment 4, Boc-l-val 6 was coupled with H2N-gly-OMe using EDC and HOBt
in dichloromethane to afford
dipeptide 7 in 84% yield.6 Methyl ester in 6 was hydrolyzed using lithium hydroxide
and coupled with Me-NH-l-ala-OMe using 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid
hexafluorophosphate (HATU) to give tripeptide 8 in 68%
yield. One more peptide coupling with Me-NH-l-leu-OMe gave
tetrapeptide 4, which on Boc deprotection resulted in
desired compound 9 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Tetrapeptide Fragment 4
For accessing proline
fragment 3, known compound 10 was prepared
from geraniol in three steps.7 Aldehyde 10 was subjected to the MOM-Wittig
reaction to give enol ether, which on treatment with the Jones reagent
underwent two steps to furnish carboxylic acid 5 in excellent
yield. Essentially, the reaction was completed in less than 20 min
at 0 °C. Evan’s chiral auxiliary coupling followed by
stereoselective installation of the methyl group resulted in compound 12 in 88% yield over two steps.8 Auxiliary hydrolysis and coupling of H2N-l-pro-OMe
was carried out using HATU and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in dimethylformamide (DMF) to furnish
key component 13 (Scheme 3). It is the key intermediate with the desired methyl
stereochemistry and olefin geometry to be used for total synthesis
of Janadolide and its analogues.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Compound 13
Thus, compound 13 was reacted with 2.2 equiv of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone
(DDQ) in a 5:1 mixture of dichloromethane and phosphate buffer (pH
= 7) at 0 °C to obtain aldehyde 14, in which deprotection-allylic
oxidation took place in one-pot operation (Scheme 4). Aldehyde 14 was treated with tert-butylmagnesium chloride to furnish proline fragment 3 in 62% yield. At this stage, both the diastereomers were
inseparable by silica gel column chromatography. We therefore decided
to go forward with the mixture, expecting that the separation of diastereomers
would become possible at a later stage. The methyl ester in compound 3 was hydrolyzed to acid, followed by coupling of the resulting
acid with tetrapeptide 9, gave hydroxyl ester 2 in 78% yield over two steps. Again, methyl ester hydrolysis in compound 2 gave seco-acid, which is ready for macrolactonization. Unfortunately,
the seco-acid did not form the required macrocycle under a variety
of conditions such as Shiina,9 Yamaguchi,10 or Mitsunobu11 lactonizations
(even temperature
and solvent variations did not help).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Des tert-Butyl Janadolide
At this point, we assumed that the failure of cyclization
could
be because of the bulky tert-butyl group, which is
adjacent to the macrocyclization point. For this purpose, compound 13 was carefully treated with 1.1 equiv of DDQ in CH2Cl2 and phosphate buffer to get allylic alcohol 15 in 76% yield. Addition of DDQ was done in one portion to
avoid the oxidation of allylic alcohol to aldehyde. Compound 15 on hydrolysis followed by coupling with tetrapeptide 9 provided the required cyclization precursor. Seco-acid was
prepared by hydrolysis of 16, which under Shiina lactonization
conditions using 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic anhydride (MNBA), 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP), and DIPEA in refluxing CH2Cl2 furnished
macrocyclic des-tert-butyl Janadolide 17 in 34% isolated yield. The desired macrocycle formation was indicated
by deshielding of the hydroxyl-attached methylene proton from δ
4.14 to 4.57 ppm (due to macrocyclic lactone). In addition, N-methyl signals are separated by ∼0.2 ppm, as observed
by product
NMR analysis, whereas they are together in the case of the acyclic
precursor. This kind of separation is also seen in the natural macrocycle,
suggesting the desired product formation. The authenticity of the
product was further confirmed by 13C NMR and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS). It is worth mentioning that no detectable
epimerization took place as we have observed only single set of signals
in the final compound NMR (1H and 13C). All
of the spectral details are available in the Supporting Information. Thus, we have accomplished the synthesis of a
close analogue of natural Janadolide 17, a 23-membered
macrocycle, with all of the desired functionalities (except the tert-butyl group) in place.

Having synthesized the
Janadolide analogue for the first time,
we became interested in evaluating its potential antiparasitic activity.
Because our Janadolide analogue lacks the tert-butyl
group, it allowed us to test the role of this group in the antitrypanosomal
activity. Bioactivity assays were carried out as previously reported12 to monitor parasite viability in the presence
of the Janadolide analogue and estimate the IC50 value
for parasite killing. Assay details are given in the Supporting Information. Suenaga et al. had reported very potent
antitrypanosomal activity of Janadolide (IC50 47 nM) against T. brucei GUT at 3.1 strain.2 Here, we have tested the Janadolide analogue against the T. brucei 427 strain. Interestingly, our Janadolide
analogue exhibited only a moderate killing activity (IC50 = 3.96 μM), in comparison to that of pentamidine and oligomycin,
for which we obtained IC50 values of 1 and 74 nM, respectively
(Table 1). The weaker
activity could be attributed to the absence of 1,3 strain in the newly
synthesized molecule.

Table 1 Antitrypanosomal
Activity
compound	IC50	standard deviation	
pentamidine	0.9 nM	±0.39 nM	
oligomycin	74.3 nM	±3.8 nM	
compound 17	3.96 μM	±0.46 μM	
Conclusions
Briefly, we have explored the macrolactonization
strategy to construct
a 23-membered cycle toward total synthesis of natural product Janadolide.
However, our attempts on cyclization in the vicinity of the tert-butyl group were unsuccessful. We also demonstrated
that the tert-butyl group is vital for potent antitrypanosomal
activity. Total synthesis of this natural product and its analogues
by alternate strategies, followed by structure–activity relationship
studies, will be the subject of future work.

General Information
All reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under a
positive pressure of argon or nitrogen, unless otherwise mentioned,
with magnetic stirring. Air-sensitive reagents and solutions were
transferred via a syringe or cannula and were introduced to the apparatus
via rubber septa. All reagents, starting materials, and solvents were
obtained from commercial suppliers and used as such without further
purification. Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography
(TLC) with 0.25 mm precoated silica gel plates (60 F254). The TLC
spots were visualized under a UV lamp or using staining solutions
such as phosphomolybdic acid, para-anisaldehyde,
2,4-DNP solution, KMnO4 solution, ninhydrin solution, or
Iodine adsorbed on silica gel, followed by heating with a heat gun
for ∼15 s. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel
(100–200 or 230–400 mesh size). Deuterated solvents
for NMR spectroscopic analyses were used as received. All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a 200, 400,
or 500 MHz spectrometer. Coupling constants were measured in hertz.
All chemical shifts were quoted in ppm, relative to CDCl3 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), using the residual solvent peak as
a reference standard. The following abbreviations were used to explain
the multiplicities: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet,
m = multiplet, br = broad. HRMS (ESI) were recorded on an ORBITRAP
mass analyzer (Thermo Scientific, Q Exactive). Mass spectra were recorded
with ESI ionization in an MSQ LCMS mass spectrometer. Infrared (IR)
spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
as a thin film. Chemical nomenclature was generated using Chem Bio
Draw Ultra 14.0. Melting points of solids were measured in a Buchi
B-540 melting point apparatus. Optical rotation values were recorded
on a Jasco P-2000 polarimeter at 589 nm.

Antitrypanosomal Assay Protocol
Trypanosoma
brucei parasites (427 strain) were maintained in in
vitro culture using modified HMI-9 media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum. For determining the antitrypanosomal activity
of the Janadolide analogue and other standard inhibitors, a modified
version of the previously reported protocol for the whole-cell-based
dose-dependent bioactivity assay was employed.12 Briefly, the test compounds were serially diluted in 100
μL of cell culture medium and seeded in 96-well plates, in triplicate,
to a final concentration ranging from 10 μM to 10 nM. To this,
another 100 μL of cell culture medium containing ∼2000
parasites was added. After incubating the cultures for 72 h, under
optimal growth conditions, the viability of parasites was checked
by treating the cultures for 1 h with 10 μM resazurine dye.
Resazurine will be irreversibly reduced by live cells into resorufin,
which when excited at 570 nm emits fluorescence at 585 nm. The IC50 values were calculated from the dose-dependent percentage
inhibition obtained for each test compound. Pentamidine and oligomycin,
which have potent antitrypanosomal activity, were used as positive
indicators for parasite killing, and 1% DMSO-treated parasite cultures
were used as negative controls in the assay.
