Silica
nanoparticles (SiO2NPs) from renewable sources
can be used in very different materials, such as paints, membranes
for fuel cells, Li-ion batteries, adsorbents, catalysts, and so on.
Brazil is the world’s largest producer of sugarcane and generates
huge amounts of sugarcane waste ash (SWA), which is a Si-rich source.
This study investigates a method to produce highly pure SiO2NPs from SWA. The SiO2NPs were characterized by inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, scanning and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction analyses, specific surface
area and pore distribution, UV and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
and thermogravimetric analyses and applied as an adsorbent material
in the removal of acid orange 8 (AO8) dye from aqueous solution. The
SiO2 content was 88.68 and 99.08 wt % for SWA and SiO2NPs, respectively. TEM images of SWA and SiO2NPs
exhibit drastic alterations of the material size ranging from several
micrometers to less than 20 nm. The SiO2NPs showed a specific
surface area of 131 m2 g–1 and adsorption
capacity of around 230 mg g–1 for acid orange 8
dye. Furthermore, the recycling of the SiO2NPs adsorbent
after AO8 adsorption was very satisfactory, with reuse for up to five
cycles being possible. The results indicate that it was possible to
obtain highly pure silica in a nanosize from the waste material and
produce an adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and the possibility
of reuse.

Introduction
Adding value to agroindustrial
solid wastes, produced on a large
scale, is a challenge for sustainable and green chemistry. Innovative
and creative ways to reduce waste and the contamination of the environment,
minimizing environmental impacts, have been targeted in the 21st century.1−3 The largest agroindustrial by-products of the world are rice husk
and straw, corn cobs, wheat straw, and sugarcane bagasse. Among these
by-products, sugarcane bagasse and rice husk and straw can be highlighted
because of their high silicon content, being important renewable sources.4,5 However, only rice husk and ash are frequently found in the literature
as renewable sources to produce value-added materials based on silicon,
such as, silica nanoparticles (SiO2NPs).6−10

There are still few studies about the use of
sugarcane bagasse
and ash as raw materials for the production of SiO2NPs,
opening up opportunities for this material.4,11,12 In this sense, Brazil plays an important
role, as it is the largest producer of sugarcane in the world, producing
about 657 million tons per year,13,14 specially
utilized to produce sugar and ethanol, generating straw and bagasse
as main wastes. These wastes are burned as fuel in boilers that generate
the water vapor used in the production of sugar and ethanol and in
energy cogeneration processes. After burning, about 3–12 million
tons of ash/year are generated; this ash has negligible costs and
is easily overlooked in landfills. Handling and improper disposal
in places such as soil, water, and air can lead to pollution, which
causes environmental problems and human health, especially when the
silica present in the ash is in crystalline form. Ash from sugarcane
residues presents Si as the main chemical element generally above
70% by mass.15 Therefore, the development
of new studies related to the use of this raw material rich in Si
for the production of SiO2NPs is fundamental. They have
a wide range of applications in paints,16 biopolymers,17 membranes for fuel cells,18 Li-ion batteries,19 catalysts,20 stationary phases for chromatographic
columns,2 and adsorbents,21−23 among other applications.24

Adsorption
has an important functionality in the environment, being
considered one of the most promising techniques for treating waste
water. The preparation of adsorbents utilizing agroindustrial waste
generates a material known as green adsorbent. A good green adsorbent
must be low cost and have satisfactory adsorption properties and the
possibility of reuse.25 Among the green
adsorbents found in the literature, the main ones are activated carbon
and biochar produced from agroindustrial waste.26 However, SiO2NPs produced from agroindustrial
solid waste have also been applied as green adsorbents.21−23 The success of the adsorption in wastewater processes depends on
many factors, such as the high degree of porosity, the extensive internal
surface area, and the favorable chemical surface of the adsorbents.
Several studies already use SiO2NPs for the adsorption
of organic contaminants with success.21−23,27

Thus, in this study, SiO2NPs were produced from
sugarcane
waste ash (SWA) and characterized by different techniques. These nanoparticles
were applied as an adsorbent material for the removal of acid orange
8 dye from aqueous solution. The adsorption capacity and the reuse
cycles of SiO2NPs were also evaluated.

Results and Discussion
Chemical
and Structural Properties of SWA and SiO2NPs
SWA
raw, obtained by burning of sugarcane waste, can
contain a lot of different impurities, especially salt and carbon
species. The pretreatment procedure was performed aiming to eliminate
excess salts, organic compounds, and low-solubility elements through
washing and to eliminate particles with a size of more than 0.6 mm
by sieve.28

After this pretreatment
procedure, silicon was extracted from SWA by reaction with sodium
hydroxide under heating at 400 °C, as adapted from the literature.29 At 400 °C, sodium hydroxide is melted,
which increases silicon extraction. This procedure helps to increase
silicon purity, liberating elements which can be in the structure
of ash, making them more soluble. This procedure of extraction generates
silicon in the form of silicate, and after extraction, this silicate
was solubilized in deionized water, filtered, and saved for the preparation
of SiO2NPs. Sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) solution density was estimated as 1.23 g cm–3 (determined by weighing ten times 1 mL of the solution mentioned
and calculating the average) and its Si composition, as determined
by gravimetric analyses, was estimated as 5.42 wt % (following the
procedure as described in the literature30).

SiO2NPs can be prepared by a wide variety of
methods,
including the sol–gel method, hydrothermal synthesis, flame
synthesis, and the reverse microemulsion technique, and the functionalization
of SiO2NPs may be performed by grafting or co-condensation
methods. In the co-condensation, the SiO2NPs preparation
and functionalization occurs in a single step and involves the hydrolysis–condensation
reaction.20,31,32

In this
study, the sodium silicate solution obtained was utilized
to prepare SiO2NPs, the production of SiO2NPs
is based on hydrolysis (production of silanol groups) and condensation
(formation of siloxane) reaction using sulfuric acid in a biphasic
medium in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).20,33

CTAB is a classical micelle maker and helps to control the
size
of nanoparticles, to prevent agglomeration, and to modify their surface
as described in the literature.20,31,32 This way, the co-condensation procedure using sulfuric acid generates
a white solid with low dispersion in both media and easily removed
by centrifugation.

After the separation of SiO2NPs
by centrifugation, the
composition of elements present in SWA and SiO2NPs obtained
was determined by ICP–OES, (Table 1) and the morphology of SWA and SiO2NPs was determined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy
(SEM and TEM), as shown in Figure 1.

a SiO2 was determined by
gravimetric analyses. Only metals and oxide metals were determined.
The analytical technique has 1.0% of error.

ICP–OES is an analytical technique capable
of detecting
trace metals and elements in high concentrations; the weight percentage
of Si was determined by classical gravimetric analyses,34 whereas the other elements were analyzed directly
by ICP–OES. The content of SiO2 determined in sugarcane
ash was 88.68 ± 0.87 wt % and in the prepared SiO2NPs was 99.08 ± 0.99 wt %. These results demonstrate a significant
purification of sample that generates high pure SiO2NPs.
The amount of Al2O3 decreased from 1.026 wt
% (ash) to 0.997 wt % (silica), which is a slight decrease compared
to Fe2O3, from 1.688 wt % (ash) to 0.363 wt
% (silica) and TiO2, from 0.686 wt % (ash) to 0.063 wt
% (silica). The amount of (PO4)3– and
NiO was the same for ash and silica samples.

The elements CaO,
K, MgO, MnO, and Na, which were present in the
ash and were absent from the SiO2NPs. High purity of SiO2NPs was also observed in energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
analyses (Figure S1), as shown in the Supporting Information.

The SEM image of SWA shown in Figure 1A reveals a heterogeneous material
with irregular
shapes. Sizes between 5 and 500 μm and a high roughness were
observed, which are associated with the release of organic matter
during the bagasse burning process for the generation of energy in
the sugar-alcohol industry. The morphologies obtained from the SWA
sample are similar to those observed by Batra et al.35 and Faria et al.36Figure 1B shows a TEM image
of a single ash; its relatively big size makes it difficult to be
analyzed by TEM.

In contrast, Figure 1C,D shows TEM images of the SiO2NPs obtained; a drastic
alteration of the material size and form prepared can be observed
compared to the original ash. The size range from several micrometers
for ash decreases to less than 20 nm for SiO2NPs, but nanoparticles
with a large distribution of size are not observed. However, no defined
form is observed for synthesized nanoparticles, but it is possible
to see that they do not present nanoparticles bigger than 50 nm, which
is very similar to the size of the SiO2NPs reported by
Rafiee et al.,37 Hassan et al.,38 Le et al.,39 Bahrami
et al.,40 and To et al.,41 for SiO2NPs obtained from rice husk.

Therefore,
this method, using a micellar environment in the process
of synthesis of nanoparticles, is very effective to control the size;
nevertheless, nonuniform SiO2NPs were generated. However,
these results demonstrate that nanoparticles made of silica from SWA
produce nanoparticles with the same form as others produced from rice
husk or commercial reactants.40−42

The crystallographic properties
of SWA also change when compared
to SiO2NPs, as shown in Figure 2. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the SWA
shows only peaks relative to crystalline silica, being very similar
to the quartz pattern, whereas SiO2NPs have a pattern that
is very similar to amorphous silica.43,44 In fact, when
an organic material with a high percentage of silicon is burned, as
reported for sugarcane waste, with the aim of generating energy, it
can generate amorphous or crystalline silica; high temperatures (900–1000
°C) generate crystalline silica, while quartz in a crystalline
form is formed in the case of SWA.45

Figure 2 X-ray diffraction
analyses (XRD) patterns of the SWA (blue) and
SiO2NPs (black) samples.

The synthesis of SiO2NPs generates amorphous silica,
as can be seen by a band with a maximum peak at θ = 22°,43 while the crystalline form of silica can be
highly toxic, promoting silicosis; the amorphous form is almost inoffensive,
being even used for drug delivery,21 which
provides another possible application for the obtained SiO2NPs.

As already mentioned, SiO2NPs (Figure 1C,D) have a size that is much
smaller than
SWA (Figure 1A,B);
consequently, a significant increase of the specific surface area
is expected, which confirmed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) analyses as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of
the SWA
(▲ adsorption and △ desorption) and SiO2NPs
(• adsorption and ○ desorption) samples. Inset: Pore
size distribution of the SWA (△) and silica nanoparticle samples
(○).

In the BET measurements,
an isotherm type II can be observed for
the SiO2NPs with a hysteresis of H3 type, associated to
slit-shaped pores formed by aggregates of platelike particles, resulting
in a large pore size distribution, that is, type IIb isotherm.46,47 The absence of a plateau in the relative pressure close to 1 in
the SiO2NPs isotherm shows the presence of macropores,
and the hysteresis loop observed between the adsorption–desorption
branches is the indication of mesopores.46−49 The sugarcane ash isotherm, in
turn, has isotherm type III, because of a weak adsorbent–adsorbate
interaction. The absence of hysteresis loop between the adsorption–desorption
branches in the SWA isotherm indicates the absence of mesopores. Therefore,
the mesoporous structure of the SiO2NPs was evaluated through
the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (inset in Figure 3).

In Figure 3 (inset),
in the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm results,
a wide pore size distribution between 7 and 50 nm can be observed
for the SiO2NPs sample, which indicates mesoporous materials,
along with a small distribution of pores above 50 nm, which also suggests
the presence of macroporous materials in the structure of nanoparticles.

Thus, these results suggest the coexistence of mesopores and macropores.
The average pore diameter from the desorption isotherm branch of SiO2NPs was 22 nm (mesoporous materials), as calculated by the
BJH model (Table 2).
However, the SWA sample presented only a microporous structure, because
it did not present the distribution of pores above 2 nm.

The textural properties of the SWA and silica nanoparticle
samples
are reported in Table 2. The specific surface area of samples was calculated by the BET
method, and the average pore diameter and pore volume were calculated
by the BJH method. The surface area and pore volume of SiO2NPs were about 23 and 35 times larger than the values found for the
SWA, respectively.

The pore volume and surface area of SiO2NPs in this
study are higher than those found by Yan et al.,50 where wet-SiO2 sample was dried by a method
similar to that used here. The SiO2NPs surface area was
similar to that reported by Affandi et al.,51 and Bahrami et al.40 for silica obtained
from bagasse ash and rice husk ash, respectively.

Adsorption
Study of the SiO2NPs Adsorbent
The adsorption
of pollutants is one of the most common applications
of SiO2NPs; this material has been extensively utilized
to adsorb heavy metals, emerging pollutants, dyes, and others, in
drinking water.52−54 The adsorption kinetics study can provide multiple
information about the velocity of adsorption, the mechanism involved
in binding to the adsorbent, and the adsorption capacity of the material.
In this case was utilized acid orange 8, an azo dye, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Effect of time on removal
of acid orange 8 by silica nanoparticle
adsorbent. Conditions: 25 °C; initial concentration: 150 and
200 mg L–1; adsorbent mass: 1.0 g L–1.

Figure 4 presents
the effect of AO8 adsorption as a function of time, in terms of percentage
of AO8 removed, for two initial concentrations of the dye. It was
observed that the removal percentage in 5 min was around 46 and 50%
for Ci = 200 and 150 mg L–1, respectively, while the removal percentage in 30 min was around
63 and 80% for Ci = 200 and 150 mg L–1, respectively.

The adsorption capacity was
constant only after 4 h, where the
removal percentage was around 89 and 95% for Ci = 200 and 150 mg L–1, respectively.

The velocity of adsorption depends, generically, of physicochemical
characteristics of the adsorbate, adsorbent, and solution; in this
case, CTAB (the stabilizer) plays an important role. Considering the
methodology utilized, it is expected to find CTAB on the surface of
the nanoparticles, which worked as an agent of size control in the
synthetic procedure and as a stabilizer, as can be seen in other publications.21,23

This surfactant has a positive charge and therefore shows
affinity
for anionic species, as AO8 at pH ≈ 5, the pH of deionized
water, is utilized in an adsorption study. This negative charge in
AO8 comes from the sulfonate group (R-SO3–) present in the structure, which has a pKa lower than—2.55

However,
the electrostatic mechanism is not the only interaction
expected between AO8 and SiO2NPs, CTAB has a long alkyl
chain with 16 aliphatic carbons, generating hydrophobic regions around
the surface of the nanoparticles. AO8, in turn, has three aromatic
rings in its structure, with two being connected naphthalene-like,
suggesting a polar molecule with nonpolar regions. These characteristics
of AO8 suggest the possibility of π–π packing among
the molecules and, consequently, the formation of multilayers in the
process of adsorption.

The presence of both molecules CTAB and
AO8, on the surface of
the SiO2NPs, can be observed by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), as can be seen in Figure 5, where the IR spectra of SiO2NPs, AO8 dye, and SiO2NPs after AO8 adsorption are presented.55

Figure 5 FTIR–attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectra
of the (a)
SiO2NPs, (b) acid orange 8 dye, and (c) SiO2NPs + AO8 dye Ci = 200 mg L–1. Inset: Regions of the spectrum of dye adsorption on SiO2NPs.

Analyzing every component separately, Figure 5a presents the FTIR
spectrum of SiO2NPs, where the presence of four main bands
of silica is observed;
at 799 and 446 cm–1, the bands correlate with symmetric
stretching of siloxane groups (Si–O–Si), the very strong
band at 1058 cm–1 is assigned to Si–O–Si
asymmetric stretching, and that at 965 cm–1 is due
to OH bending, from silanol groups.

Bands related to the presence
of CTAB are observed on SiO2NPs, at 2850 and 2922 cm–1, due to CH2 symmetric and asymmetric stretching,
respectively.8,11,56−58

Figure 5b shows
the spectrum of AO8, where peaks between 1660 and 375 cm–1 are observed; however, no peak around 2900 cm–1 appears, enabling the AO8 signals of CTAB to be distinguished.

Figure 5c shows
the spectrum of SiO2NPs after AO8 adsorption, where intense
peaks of silica are observed, along with less intense bands of organic
molecules. It is possible to observe the peaks of CTAB around 2900
cm–1 and the peaks of AO8 with lower intensity between
1660 and 375 cm–1. Some regions of the spectra in Figure 5 were expanded; in
these expansions, it is not possible to observe apparent shifts of
peaks, which suggests a nonchemical interaction between SiO2NPs and AO8; however, it is possible to see a mixing of vibrational
modes of each species, that is, special spectrum (c) shows vibrational
modes of silica overlaying AO8 modes. The assignment of all peaks
can be observed in Table S1.

The
interaction between CTAB and AO8 can be also investigated utilizing
thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). TGA can be used to quantify organic/inorganic
materials present in a sample as well to distinguish the presence
of different materials or to observe alterations in the thermal behavior
of species when they interact with a surface. We were able to observe
these points in our study. Figure 6 shows TG and derivative TG (DTG) curves of CTAB, SiO2NPs, SiO2NPs after AO8 adsorption and AO8 dye
(see Tables S2–S4 and Figure S2).

Figure 6 TG and DTG curves of (A) CTAB, (B) SiO2NPs, (C) SiO2NPs + AO8 (Ci = 50 mg L–1), (D) SiO2NPs +
AO8 (Ci =
100 mg L–1), (E) SiO2NPs + AO8 (Ci = 150 mg L–1), (F) SiO2NPs + AO8 (Ci = 200 mg –1), (G) SiO2NPs + AO8 (Ci =
400 mg L–1), and (H) AO8 dye. The measures were
performed under an oxygen atmosphere.

The TG curve of CTAB (Figure 6A) shows a significant weight loss between 180 and
300 °C (86.55%, DTG at 239 °C) and a second loss between
300 and 490 °C (12.41%, DTG at 435 °C), leaving 1.04% of
residue and inorganic impurities related to the purity of reactant
purchased.

As already shown by FTIR spectra, SiO2NPs have CTAB
on their surface, and the TGA curve for SiO2NPs (Figure 6B) shows this CTAB
decomposition at a higher temperature, when it is bound to the SiO2NPs (DTG at 256 °C) than isolated CTAB (DTG at 239 °C).
This increase in the decomposing temperature is related to a higher
thermal stabilization of the molecules by electrostatic charges pairing
between CTAB and the SiO2 surface. Figure 6B also shows the unbound CTAB on the silica
surface (DTG at 215 °C) due to hydrophobic–hydrophobic
interactions of interconnected CTAB; both effects have already been
observed in other publications.59

After the complete decomposition of organic material on the surface
of SiO2NPs, a residue of 64.74% was obtained, as can be
seen in Figure 6B.

Two different behaviors can be highlighted in the TGA curves of
the interaction between SiO2NPs with different concentrations
of AO8. First, it is possible to see a shift in DTG band at 256 °C
to high temperatures, with the increase in the concentration of AO8
(Figure 6C–G);
this can be explained by analyzing the DTG of AO8 dye pure (Figure 6H). AO8 shows a weight
loss at 327 °C, which influences the weight loss related to CTAB,
making the DTG band shift to higher temperatures, where the loss observed
an average of both molecules.

The second point is related to
the mass residue of the sample after
AO8 adsorption; for SiO2NPs (Figure 6B) without AO8, a final residue of inorganic
material (SiO2) of 64,74% was observed, after the adsorption
of AO8 solution at a concentration of 50 mg L–1,
which increases to 69.95% (Figure 6C), suggesting the presence of less organic materials
and, consequently, a relative larger quantity of SiO2.
The quantity of inorganic residue decreases with increasing amount
of AO8 adsorbed; all of the results obtained are presented in Table S2.

These TGA results show an initial
substitution of CTAB weakly binding
to the nanoparticle surface by AO8.59 This
initial decrease indicates that each molecule of AO8 replaces more
than one CTAB, which is a linear replacement until Ci = 100 mg L–1 (63.97% of residue),
when it starts to form multilayers of dye saturating the surface after
200 mg L–1.

This mechanism of multilayer formation
proposed by TGA results
agrees with kinetic results, presented in Figure 7 (see Figures S5 and S6), and the isotherm results, presented
in Figure 8 (see Figure S7), both calculated by UV–visible
spectroscopy, utilizing the peak with λmax = 489
nm.

Figure 7 Pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order model kinetics plot
for the removal of AO8 by the silica nanoparticle adsorbent. Conditions:
25 °C; initial concentration: 200 mg L–1; adsorbent
mass: 1.0 g L–1.

Conditions: 25, 35, and 45 °C; time: 4 h; adsorbent mass: 1.0
g L–1. Inset: Different models of isotherms plotted
for experimental data obtained at 25 °C.

Figure 7 presents
the kinetic results of the adsorption of a solution of AO8 in an initial
concentration of 200 mg L–1 at 25 °C from 0
to 24 h. It is possible to observe that AO8 adsorption occurs very
fast in the first hour, with 65% of dye being adsorbed, and saturation
occurring after 4 h. Considering the kinetic models tested, pseudo
first-order, and pseudo second-order (details of the equation are
presented in Supporting Information in
eqs S1 and S2), it is possible to observe a better adjustment to the
pseudo second-order model (see Figure S6 and Table S5).

Kinetic models are
important for describing the mechanism associated
with the process of adsorption of the analyte to the adsorbent and
are not associated with stoichiometry in the system.60

A pseudo first-order model depends basically on the
analyte concentration
and temperature. A pseudo second-order model, according to the model
proposed by Ho and McKay,61 applied to
the process of adsorption/chemisorption, depends not only on the process
of binding the analyte to the adsorbent but also to the diffusion
of this analyte in the particle and/or film, which indicates the organization
of the analyte on the surface of the particle. In our case, this process
can be related to the process of the formation of multilayers on the
surface of the nanoparticle. The calculated qe values were close to those found experimentally (Table S5).

Adsorption isotherms, in turn,
describe the relationship between
the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed by the adsorbent (qe) and the concentration of the adsorbate remaining in
the solution after the system reaches equilibrium (Ce) at a constant temperature. In this study, the Langmuir,62 Freundlich,63 and
Liu60 isothermal models are presented in
the inset of Figure 8. On the basis of the isotherm parameters of Table S6, the Liu model presented the best values of coefficient
of determination adjusted (Radj.2), confirming that this is the best model to explain the equilibrium
adsorption of AO8 by the silica nanoparticle adsorbent.

While
the Langmuir model is an excellent model applied for processes
involving formation of monolayers of molecules on the surface of particles/films
in a finite and defined number of adsorption sites, the Freundlich
model has a better application for nonhomogenous processes, over heterogeneous
surfaces, and is not limited to monolayers or any uniform distribution.
Finally, the Liu model can be applied to a system which has characteristics
of both systems before cited.

In the model proposed by Liu,
the active sites on the adsorbent
do not have the same energy, which makes the adsorbent a preferential
site for adsorption, leading to saturation, different to that which
occurs in the Freundlich isotherm model.64

In our case, the Liu model shows a better plot than the other
models
(Figure 8, inset),
which indicates the formation of multilayers of AO8 over SiO2NPs, as well as a plateau, suggesting the saturation of adsorption. Figure 8 also presents a
temperature effect in the process of adsorption, it is possible to
see a relative increase in the capacity with an increase in the temperature,
indicating an endothermic process, as reported in other publications.46

Finally, the recycling of SiO2NPs was tested, aiming
to evaluate how many times it could be used until its adsorption capacity
is lost. As observed in Figure 9, SiO2NPs can be used up to five times, adsorbing
more than 90% of AO8; after five times, its capacity decays exponentially,
possibly due to the partial removal of CTAB on the surface of nanoparticles
because of the process of adsorption and the isolation of nanoparticles.59

Figure 9 Recycling of SiO2NPs after AO8 adsorption, Ci = 20 mg L–1 at 25 °C
for 2 h
(see Figures S8 and S9).

Nevertheless, these results
were shown to be adequate for this
material to be inexpensive and indicate the possible utilization of
these nanoparticles to concentrate analytes in low concentrations,
opening up the possibility to utilize solid phase extraction cartridges,
filters, or other materials, aimed at remediation or analytical applications.

Conclusions
This study utilized SWA for the first time,
to successfully produce
SiO2NPs, and this process generated nanoparticles with
high purity (>99% of SiO2). In the preparation, cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide was utilized as a stabilizer and size-controller. SiO2NPs were characterized by TEM, which showed the presence of
very small nanoparticles (<20 nm), and by the BET method, which
presented a specific surface area of 131 m2 g–1, about 23 times higher than the raw sugarcane ash. Kinetic and isotherm
results, in addition to thermogravimetric analyses, indicated that
AO8 adsorbed to SiO2NPs, forming multiple layers. Furthermore,
the SiO2NPs showed great adsorption capacity, around 230
mg g–1 and with the possibility of reuse, making
it possible to reuse this for up to five cycles, adsorbing more than
90%. The results indicate that it was possible to obtain a good green
adsorbent, from a renewable source, at low cost. Besides the application
as an adsorbent material, these highly pure SiO2NPs have
the potential for application in catalysts, biopolymers, paints, among
others.

deionized water (resistivity > 18.2 MΩ cm) obtained from
a Milli-Q
deionizer (Elix Millipore). SWA, utilized in this study, was donated
by Cosan S. A., Brazil. Sodium hydroxide micropearls (>99%), hydrochloric
acid (35–37%), and n-butyl alcohol (>99%)
were purchased from Synth, Brazil. Sulfuric acid (95–97%) and
CTAB (≥98%) were purchased from Merck, Germany. Acid orange
8 (AO8) dye (65%) was purchased from Aldrich, United States of America.

Characterization
The chemical compositions of SWA and
SiO2NPs were analyzed gravimetrically (for Si composition)
and by ICP–OES. Briefly, silica composition was determined
adapting the procedure from the literature,34 where 100 mg of the sample (SWA or SiO2NPs) was placed
in a melting pot and calcined at 1000 °C; this sample was titrated
with hydrofluoric acid, until complete dissolution of silica, and
evaporated; and SiO2 was estimated using the residual mass.
The other elements were determined by ICP–OES, model Spectro
Arcos from Ametek. SEM images were recorded on a tabletop microscope
from Hitachi, model TM3030, at a typical acceleration voltage of 5.0
kV. TEM images were registered using a microscope from JEOL, model-JEM-2100.
TEM samples were prepared by dispersing a small amount of sample in
water (∼1 g L–1) and sonicated in high shear,
and then, 1 μL of suspension was placed onto a copper grid covered
by a carbon thin film and dried in air. XRD were performed using a
diffractometer Rigaku Multiflex with a Cu anode using Co Kα
radiation at 40.0 kV and 20.0 mA over the range (2θ) of 5–80°
with a scan time of 0.5° min–1. The specific
surface area and pore distribution of samples were analyzed by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C
using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. UV–visible spectra
of the samples were obtained in a spectrophotometer Varian, model
Cary 1E, using quartz cuvettes with a 1.0 cm path length and scanning
sample from 200 to 600 nm. FTIR was performed using a spectrometer
from Bruker, model Alpha, operating in ATR mode. The spectra were
obtained using 200 cumulative scans, range 375–4000 cm–1. Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded in a thermogravimetric
analyzer TGA/SDTA from Mettler Toledo. Then, ∼10.0 mg was weighed
and analyzed under an oxygen atmosphere with a flow of 50.0 mL min–1, using an alumina-port sample heated to 900 °C
with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. To obtain
TG curves of SiO2NPs after an interaction with AO8, the
nanoparticles were isolated by centrifugation, dried for 5 h at 100
°C, and analyzed. All curves were obtained under the oxygen atmosphere.

Pretreatment of the SWA
Around 200 g of SWA was added
to 1000 mL of 0.10 mol L–1 HCl and kept under shaking
for 2 h. The suspension was then filtered and washed with deionized
water. The solid was oven-dried at 120 °C overnight, the SWA
was sieved (particles ≤ 0.60 mm), and the fraction with smaller
particles was saved.28

Preparation
of Sodium Silicate Solution from SWA
The
washed SWA was mixed with NaOH solid (1:1.5, w/w) and heated in a
muffle at 400 °C for 1 h. Then, 100 mL of deionized water was
added to the mixture and refluxed for 4 h. Then, the mixture was filtered
to separate the solid residue of the sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) solution.29,33,37,38 This procedure is illustrated
in Scheme S1, Supporting Information.

Surfactant-Mediated Synthesis of SiO2NPs from the
Obtained Sodium Silicate
Utilizing a 500 mL round bottom
flask, 4.5 g of CTAB was dissolved in a mixture composed of 100 mL
of water and 100 mL of butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) and heated to 60 °C.
To this emulsion/biphasic system, 40 mL of sodium silicate solution
obtained previously was added, under constant stirring. Finally, a
0.5 mol L–1 sulfuric acid solution was added to
this solution, dropwise, until the pH decreased to 4, and the resulting
gel was aged at 60 °C for 8 h. The aged SiO2NPs in
the gel were washed with distilled water, filtered, and oven-dried
at 120 °C.39 This procedure is illustrated
in Scheme S2, Supporting Information.

Adsorption Study
The adsorption studies of AO8 dye
were conducted at different initial dye concentrations, ranging from
50 to 1000 mg L–1. The experiments in batch were
performed at 25, 35, and 45 °C. SiO2NPs samples (adsorbent
dose = 1.0 g L–1) were added to the dye solution
and shaken at 100 rpm for different times from 0 to 24 h. All experiments
were performed in triplicate. Analytical curves (Figure S10) were prepared to follow the analysis of aqueous
solutions containing known amounts of the analyte standard. The concentration
of AO8 was determined by using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
at its maximum absorbance wavelength (489 nm). To measure the absorbance
of samples after adsorption, they were centrifuged at 1560 G, the
supernatant was removed, and then, their absorbance was measured.
The amount of dye removal was expressed as the removal percentage
of AO8 and calculated by eq 1 1  where Ci and Cf are the initial and
final concentration of
AO8, respectively. The amount of AO8 adsorption as a function of time
and at equilibrium, qt and qe (mg g–1), respectively,
were calculated using the following eqs 2 and 3 2   3  where Ci, Cf, and Ce (mg L–1) are concentrations of AO8 at initial, final, and
equilibrium, respectively, V (L) is the volume of
AO8 solution, and m (g) is the mass of the adsorbent.65 Recyclability experiments were performed, similarly
to the adsorption studies, using the same SiO2NPs sample
repeatedly, renewing dye solution with constant concentration.
