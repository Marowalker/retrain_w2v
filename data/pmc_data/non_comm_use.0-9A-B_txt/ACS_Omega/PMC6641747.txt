Pure
and Tb-doped nanocrystalline
KY3F10 specimens were synthesized by coprecipitation, and portions of the
samples underwent further heat treatment at 600 °C in a fluorinated
atmosphere. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns acquired at 30
keV allowed to determine both long- and short-range ordered structures
by Rietveld and pair distribution function (PDF) analyses, respectively.
PDF examination of the as-synthesized sample allowed to discern a
slight deviation from the basic cubic building unit because the Y–F
bond lengths could be explained in S.G. I4/mmm with cell parameters a = 8.1520(9)
Å and c = 11.5876(29) Å, whereas Rietveld
analysis could equally well fit both the cubic and tetragonal descriptions
for the heat-treated specimens. Also, PDF revealed that the as-synthesized
sample exhibited less structural coherence than the heat-treated one.

Introduction
Luminescent
nanoparticles have been intensively studied recently
due to their potential applications in high-performance magnets, luminescent
devices, catalysts, photovoltaics, radiation detectors, and solid-state
dosimeters, among other functional materials.1−3

In previous
works,4−6 the synthesis of KY3F10 nanocrystals—doped
with rare-earth ions—from coprecipitation in aqueous solutions
of NH4HF2 was optimized and studied in detail.
Studies of nanocrystalline KY3F10 doped with
Tb (Tb:KY3F10) have shown satisfactory thermoluminescence
properties, qualifying this material to be used in high-dose radiation
dosimetry.4 The analysis of Tb:KY3F10 nanocrystals structure over multiple length scales
is of utmost importance because their electronic structure, surface
energy, and chemical reactivity are directly related to the crystal
structure. Besides, structural effects can occur in the nanoparticles
due to their small sizes because surface driving forces can induce
an additional pressure, causing disorder and fluctuations in the crystalline
field as well as contraction or expansion in the unit cell7 and even changes in the crystalline structure.8,9

Another interesting aspect of this compound—not being
the
main subject of this work though—is its electrical conductivity,
especially at high temperatures.10 Its
conduction mechanism has been described in terms of anion Frenkel
defects to explain the fluorine vacancy mobility.10,11

Arguably, these detailed structural variables can only be
procured
by X-ray or neutron diffraction techniques.12 In this work, we have applied the so-called pair distribution function
(PDF) analysis13 in combination with Rietveld
method to probe both the average and local structure of Tb:KY3F10. This approach allows us to first study the
average structure (by Rietveld method) and then compare it with the
information acquired from a short-range structural probe (PDF analysis).
The PDF is more sensitive to local distortions of the structure and
very sensitive to the range of structural coherence in the material.
The combination of these techniques allows us to obtain a very detailed
picture of the structure of Tb:KY3F10.

In this study, because the luminescence efficiency improves after
heat treatment,5,14−16 two batches
were analyzed: as synthesized (AS) and heat treated (HT). Pure and
Tb-doped KY3F10 were investigated in parallel,
probing both local and average structures to verify if partial substitution
by Tb and synthesis route had any influence in the crystalline order.

Methods
The average crystal structure was first probed through Rietveld
refinement of the powder diffraction data. However, as it is well
known, Rietveld analysis is based solely on the Bragg peaks, so if
the sample being analyzed has very broadened peaks, as for nanocrystalline
materials for example, or there is an important contribution of diffuse
scattering to the diffraction profile, Rietveld analysis may not be
the best choice. To overcome such situation, a method called pair
distribution function (PDF), first described by Zernike and Prins,13 can be applied. This kind of analysis has proven
to be a powerful tool to study the atomic arrangement of nanocrystals
and materials that exhibit substantial disordering.

PDF analysis
permits the simultaneous analysis of Bragg peaks and
diffuse scattering. To achieve this, the information contained in
the whole reciprocal space, over a wide range of the scattering vector Q⃗, must be extracted and therefore a Fourier transform
of the diffraction data needs to be performed for the obtention of
the pair distribution function G(r).17

Crystal Structure Description
The KY3F10 structure under ambient conditions
presents a face-centered cubic crystal structure (fluorite-type structure)
belonging to the Fm3̅m space
group, with a = 11.553(1) Å.18 The structure description is shown in Table 1.

K	K+	8c	1/4	1/4	1/4	
a Z = 8.

b Every site is represented by its
multiplicity (m) and Wyckoff position (W).

The structure has been traditionally described as
a 2 × 2
× 2 fluorite superstructure, with two ionic groups [KY3F8]2+ and [KY3F12]2– alternating along the three crystallographic directions.10,11,18,19 However, as pointed out in refs (18, 20), and (21), the basic
unit of the structure is a square antiprism composed of a central
atom of yttrium linked to two squares of fluorine atoms, one of them
containing four F1 atoms and the other containing four F2 atoms (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Basic unit of the structure.
A central Y atom linked to eight F
atoms. The coordination polyhedron is a square antiprism.

The basic cluster assemblage is composed of six
antiprisms. However,
there are two alternative ways of describing the arrangement, centered
around either an empty cube or an empty cuboctahedron (see Figure 2). In either case,
the basic formula of the assemblage is [Y6F20]2–.18,20

Figure 2 Two alternative views
of the basic assemblages [Y6F20]2– composed of six cubic antiprisms: (a)
around an empty cube formed by eight F1 atoms and (b) around an empty
cuboctahedron formed by 12 F2 atoms. Potassium atoms are omitted for
clarity.

The antiprisms around empty cubes
share edges, and those around
empty octahedra share corners. The fluorine atoms link contiguous
antiprisms; F1 is shared by three, whereas F2 is shared by two, as
can be seen in Figure 2. The empty cubes are located on the vertices and the middle of the
faces of the unit cell, whereas the empty cuboctahedra are situated
at the center of the unit cell and on the middle of its edges. The
three-dimensional representation of the structure can be described
as layers of [Y6F20]2– empty
cube-centered assemblages stacked along a, b, and c axes (see Figure 3 (top)). The potassium atoms are distributed
along channels running parallel to the a, b, and c axes. See Figure 3 (bottom) for the global structure.

Figure 3 KY3F10 global structure along [1 0 0] on
top and along [1 1 0] at the bottom part. The connections between
the [Y6F20]2– assemblages
are shown with the unit cell highlighted inside the rectangles.

Results and Discussion
Previously,
emission properties studies depending on the dopant
combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of rare-earth-doped
KY3F10 were carried out as described elsewhere.5,6 It was shown using Rietveld analysis that crystallite sizes remain
around 8–14 nm after thermal treatments and that luminescence
efficiency strongly increases, reaching up to 20%. Such behavior comes
from the ion distribution within the nanoparticle, which plays a very
important role in the luminescence dynamics. The crystallite size
growth induces an ion-concentration gradient toward the surface of
the nanoparticle, which is responsible for the increase in the luminescence
efficiency. Besides, when doped with Tb (Tb:KY3F10), the material also exhibits interesting thermoluminescence properties,
allowing its use in high-dose radiation dosimetry, as discussed elsewhere.4 Such properties may come from local and average
structure features that need to be investigated in detail. So first,
the average structure was studied using Rietveld analysis. As a reference,
the values from inorganic crystal structure database crystallographic
information file (ICSD CIF) File No. 40964318 were used. Cell parameters (a), atomic positions,
and isotropic atomic displacement parameters (Uiso) were refined.

The model was refined for the cubic
space group Fm3̅m, according
to the atomic distribution
described in Table 1. Three samples were analyzed: Tb:KY3F10 as
synthesized, Tb:KY3F10 heat treated, and a pure
KY3F10 heat treated. The pure sample was analyzed
for comparison with the doped samples, to probe possible structural
distortions stemming from the dopant. The results are summarized in Table 2, and the fits can
be visualized in Figure 4.

powder diffraction profiles. The profiles were calculated with Rietveld
refinement for the (a) as-synthesized Tb:KY3F10, (b) heat-treated Tb:KY3F10, and (c) pure
KY3F10 samples. Below the profiles (gray solid
line) is the difference between calculated and experimental values.
The position of the Bragg peaks is given by the vertical bars at the
bottom of the plots.

b The values are compared with the
ones of ICSD CIF file No. 409643.18

In Figure 4, it
can be seen that the cubic structure gives a good fit to the experimental
data. Table 3 shows
that almost all values are comparable to that of the reference ICSD
CIF file No. 409643.18 For the doped samples, Uiso values for Y and F1 are higher when compared
to the values for the pure heat-treated sample and for the CIF file.
These higher Uiso values can be explained
by the presence of the dopant Tb, which occupies Y position. Because
Tb has an ionic radius slightly bigger than Y (1.040 Å for Tb
and 1.019 Å for Y22), one should expect Uiso to increase. Later, Tb was included in the
model; however, no significant improvement in the Rietveld refinement
was observed, which implies that the effect of the dopant Tb on the
average structure can be neglected.

Local Structure
Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis
is particularly sensitive
to distortions that might occur locally. The local structure probed
by the experimental PDF shows that the average structure does not
reflect the local ordering. A “split” in the first PDF
peak is observed, which is not reproduced by the average structure
(pointed out by the arrows in Figure 5). Since the PDF plots were obtained using a Qmax of
20 Å−1, this permits us to discard that the
observed split might be due to a nonreliable G(r) attainment, as ripples effect from the termination of
the data at finite Q. Also, NIST Si 640d standard
PDF data were modeled up to 500 Å to obtain Qdamp and Qbroad (parameters
that describe experimental resolution effects). The PDF data modeling
for the standard leads to values of 0.002857 and 0.002897 for Qdamp and Qbroad,
respectively. In the PDF modeling, cell parameters, isotropic atomic
displacement parameters, atomic positions, and correlated atomic motion
effects (in PDFgui,23 these effects can
be modeled through delta2 parameter) were refined.

Figure 5 Experimental (symbols)
and calculated (black solid line) atomic
pair distribution functions G(r)
of synchrotron powder diffraction data. Below the functions (gray
solid line) is the difference between calculated and experimental
values. PDF modeling was performed through PDFgui23 using the cubic structure for (a) Tb:KY3F10 as-synthesized, (b) Tb:KY3F10 heat-treated,
and (c) pure KY3F10 heat-treated samples. The
arrows indicate a mismatch in the first PDF peak.

The split clearly indicates the existence of at least one
additional
yttrium–fluorine interatomic distance, which can be observed
for the three samples. As performed in the average structure analysis,
a pure KY3F10 heat-treated sample was analyzed
because one could state that the Tb doping could be locally distorting
the structure. However, as can be seen in Figure 5, the pure sample also presents the splitting,
which permit us to rule out the fact that the doping process is causing
a local distortion.

This observation, the deviation from the
reported average structure,
is therefore an intrinsic characteristic of the crystal structure
that is not affected by the doping. It should be mentioned that it
might be relevant to understand the conductivity properties of the
undoped sample and other applications in the doped compounds. This
anisotropy might affect the distribution of Frenkel pairs, which ultimately
explains the conduction mechanism of KY3F10 as
reported by Ayala et al.10

To fit
the deviations from the ideal cubic symmetry observed, compatible
space groups were sought. On the basis of the Bilbao Crystallographic
Server (www.cryst.ehu.es),24 the MAXSUB tool was used to find
possible compatible lower-symmetry space groups. Only two noncubic
space groups were found: I4/mmm (No.
139) and R3̅m (No. 166). Both
symmetries were tested, but the rhombohedral was discarded because
it did not improve the fitting. Therefore, the tetragonal space group
was kept for modeling the local deviations. This new tetragonal structural
description implies only subtle changes. Global features still hold,
and only local variations of symmetry and ion redistributions in different
sites must be considered (see Table 3). Here, it is worth to mention that a tetragonal cell
for Eu-doped KY3F10 has been recently described.3

This tetragonal symmetry involves a different
unit cell definition;
the c axis remains the same, but  and  are reformulated according to  and , respectively.

Also, this implies that the new at parameter
is equal to . The atomic distribution can be found in Table 3.

Basically, now yttrium atoms are
split in two crystallographic
sites and fluorine atoms are accommodated in three sites. Potassium
atoms remain in a unique position with fixed coordinates. The local
distribution of the antiprisms comprising the assemblages can be appreciated
in Figure 6. Now the
coordination polyhedra are pictured in different grayscales to distinguish
the two sites for yttrium. Also, the three types of fluorine sites
are pictured differently. Y1 yttrium atoms are linked to four F1,
two F2, and two F3 atoms, whereas Y2 yttrium atoms are linked to four
F1 and four F3 atoms. A consequence of this new description is that
the assemblages exhibit a slight distortion. In Figure 6, the geometry in relation to the unit cell
can be appreciated. Another outcome of this change of symmetry consists
in a new distribution of Y–F distances. In the cubic case,
there were two distances, whereas in the tetragonal description, there
are five distances: Y1 linked to F1, F2, and F3, and Y2 linked to
F1 and F3. The potassium atoms remain in fixed positions.

Figure 6 Assemblage
of [Y6F20]2– inside the tetragonal
cell. Antiprisms with different inner yttrium
atoms are colored differently: Y1, dark gray; Y2, light gray.

Consequently, the experimental
PDF was modeled again considering
the tetragonal structure. As can be seen in Figure 7, the split in the first PDF peak was better
modeled for all samples and the refinement improved within the first
10 Å range.

Larger r ranges
of the experimental PDF were also
successfully fitted using the tetragonal symmetry; in Figure 8 it is possible to see the
experimental PDF fitted up to 100 Å.

The cell parameters obtained using the cubic
structure are comparable
to the ones reported in the literature (11.553 (1) Å18), especially considering high r ranges, which can be better visualized for the heat-treated samples
(Tables 5 and 6). For the as-synthesized sample, the unit cell
parameter obtained using the cubic symmetry oscillates around 11.5477
Å.

Comparing the Rwp values
of the as-synthesized
sample for the PDF refinements, it is possible to see that when a
larger range is considered, the Rwp values
for both cubic and tetragonal symmetries are prone to converge. This
may suggest a more locally distorted structure for the as-synthesized
sample. On the contrary, the Tb-doped heat-treated sample does not exhibit
such behavior, the Rwp differences are
maintained throughout the different fitting ranges, and the tetragonal
model fits better than the cubic one.

This behavior indicates
that when the local structure distortion
fades away, as r increases, the average cubic symmetry
describes better the structure. Perhaps a better way to understand
this local structure variation is by analyzing the distortion ratio,
or deviation from the cubic symmetry, defined by c/a√2. Indeed, a value equal to 1 would indicate
a purely cubic symmetry, whereas progressively larger values of this
ratio would point out at more important deviation from cubic symmetry.
In Figure 9, these
distortion ratios are shown.

Figure 9 Distortion ratio evolution with fitting r range
of the PDF for the three samples.

By analyzing the three sets of data, a tendency to get smaller
distortions as the range increases seems to emerge. For a range value
of 10 Å, the three specimens present a high distortion ratio
to regularly descend afterward. However, the heat-treated samples
exhibit a smaller distortion rate and, bearing in mind the associated
errors, decrease following the same path, but always with a difference
between 0.0001 and 0.0002 units in the distortion ratio. This might implicate that the as-synthesized sample is composed of
very small tetragonal domains up to larger r domains,
compared to those of the heat-treated ones, and only for larger r values, it exhibits more distinctly the average cubic
symmetry.

Also, it should be noticed that the Rwp value for the as-synthesized sample is always higher
than that of
the heat-treated one. This could be possibly attributed to the presence
of other defects in the nontreated specimen that the model is not
considering.

In terms of the interatomic distances, it is possible
to see that
the distance differences between yttrium/potassium and fluorine are
similar, as presented in Table 7. This can be explained by the coordination polyhedra that
were kept, when lowering the symmetry to tetragonal. In this sense,
differences lie in the edges of each coordination polyhedron, leading
to a slightly distorted square antiprism and consequently to a slightly
distorted [Y6F20]2– assemblage.
The local distribution of assemblages in the tetragonal symmetry can
be appreciated in Figure 6, where the two different antiprisms containing Y1 and Y2
are clearly differentiated by different grayscales. All this comprises
a very small distortion of the tetragonal lattice in respect to the
cubic one; the differences between the symmetries are small and can
only be quantified by analyzing locally the interatomic distances
within clusters (distances ≈ 9 Å). This distortion is
so small that only one work cited earlier3 has reported it.

(see Table 8).

a The lattice constants
are expressed
in Å, the Debye–Waller factors in Å2,
and the Rietveld statistics factors in percent.

This indicates that small tetragonal
domains must be within the
nanoparticles, as PDF analysis has shown. However, this corresponds
to such a small distortion that the average structure can be described
by the cubic symmetry. This is corroborated by the distortion ratios
shown in Table 8 and Figure 9, where distortion
ratio tends to 1 for the heat-treated samples, whereas for the as-synthesized
sample, it agrees with the ratio found in the PDF analysis: 1.0049
(3) (see Table 4) versus
1.0049 (10) for Rietveld.

Conclusions
High-energy synchrotron
diffraction data gave access to the atomic
pair distribution function, G(r),
and revealed for all samples studied an unambiguous split of the Y–F
bond length that indicated a clear divergence from the usually adopted
cubic Fm3̅m space group, which
could be better explained in terms of tetragonal symmetry (S.G. I4/mmm).

The PDF refinements for r varying from 10 to 100
Å did show that the nanocrystalline Tb-doped sample presented
a distortion from the cubic symmetry defined as c/a√2 that steadily declined to reach a minimum
threshold at approximately 10 nm. This value of 1.0049 (3) considering
the error margin was corroborated by Rietveld analysis that provides
values for the long-order or average structure. The heat-treated,
pure, and Tb-doped samples presented a similar behavior with a progressive
decrease to 1.0023 (1) for 10 nm range and 1.0007 (1) for the average
structure obtained from Rietveld analysis and arguably could be equally
well described within Fm3̅m for the long range or average order. The nanocrystalline specimen
presented a more pronounced deviation from the cubic symmetry, as
compared to the heat-treated ones, and even for the average structure,
the more adequate symmetry describing the arrangement should be considered
as tetragonal. This fact is important because it may have implications
on the interpretation of luminescence properties of rare-earth-doped
KY3F10.

This work highlights the potential
of PDF analysis, being capable
of providing clues to detect subtle local symmetry distortions from
the average structure usually obtained from conventional methods,
such as Rietveld analysis, and provides a good example of the possibilities
opened to materials science applications.

Finally, as this work
has been done at room temperature, it is
worth mentioning that further work on this subject is under way. Synchrotron
experimental data at higher energies and at different temperatures
are already collected and will be the subject of a future publication.

Experimental
and Data Treatment
Synthesis
Tb:KY3F10 (0.4 mol
%) was obtained by coprecipitation.25,26 Under stirring,
the rare-earth oxides (99.9%, Y2O3 and Tb2O3; Aldrich) were dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric
acid (37%) and then a boiling aqueous solution of potassium fluoride
(99.9%, KF; Merck), 200% excess, was slowly added. After this, a boiling
ammonium hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution (98%, NH4HF2; Aldrich), 100% excess, was added. The resulting solution
was maintained at 80 °C with continuous stirring for 2 h. The
nanocrystals were washed and separated by centrifugation and dried
on a hot plate at 40 °C for 48 h. A portion of the obtained white
powder was treated at 600 °C in a resistive furnace for 6 h under
argon (99.995%; White Martins) and hydrofluoric acid (99.99%; Matheson)
flow in a 2:1 proportion. The pure KY3F10 sample
was synthesized in the same way as the Tb:KY3F10 sample (0.4 mol %), and the only difference is that just Y2O3 was dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid.

Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction
Room-temperature powder
diffraction data were collected at a photon energy of 30 keV in the
materials science powder diffraction (MSPD) beamline at ALBA Synchrotron
light source. The specimens were introduced in 0.8 mm diameter Lindemann
capillary tubes and kept rotating during the acquisition. The detector
system used was a Mythen II27 of six modules.
The profile was measured over 1.005–123.693° angular range
(0.3–26.8 Å–1, in Q-range) with resolution . Three samples were measured: as-synthesized
and heat-treated Tb-doped KY3F10 and a pure
heat-treated KY3F10 sample.

Data Processing
For the PDF analyses, the programs
PDFgetX328 and PDFgui22 were used for converting the X-ray diffraction data to
atomic pair distribution functions and PDF data modeling, respectively.
Rietveld analysis was accomplished with the help of TOPAS 4.2.29 Crystal structure drawings were executed with
ATOMS.30
