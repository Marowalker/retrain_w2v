The
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are well-known mediators that
are activated in tumor progression. MMP2 is a kind of gelatinase in
extracellular matrix remodeling and cancer metastasis processes. MMP2
secretion increased in many types of cancer diseases, and its abnormal
expression is associated with a poor prognosis. We fabricated a nanocomposite
that sensed MMP2 expression by a red and blue light change. This nanocomposite
consisted of an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP), MMP2-sensitive peptide,
and CuInS2/ZnS quantum dot (CIS/ZnS QD). An UCNP is composed
of NaYF4:Tm/Yb@NaYF4:Nd/Yb, which has multiple
emissions at UV/blue-visible wavelengths under 808 nm laser excitation.
The conjugated CIS/ZnS QD showed the red-visible fluorescence though
the FRET process. The two fluorophores were connected by a MMP2-sensitive
peptide to form a novel MMP2 biosensor, named UCNP@p-QD. UCNP@p-QD
was highly biocompatible according to cell viability assay. The FRET-based
biosensor was employed in the MMP2 determination in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it was administrated
into the tumor-bearing mouse to check MMP2 expression. UCNP@p-QD could
be a promising tool for biological study and biomedical application.
In this study, we demonstrated that the CIS/ZnS QD improved the upconversion
intensity through a near-infrared-induced FRET process. This nanocomposite
has the advantage of light penetration, excellent biocompatibility,
and high sensitivity to sense MMP2. The near-infrared-induced composites
are a potential inspiration for use in biomedical applications.

Introduction
Cancer metastasis is
one of the deadliest symptoms in cancer-related
diseases. The extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling occurs during
cancer metastasis, which assists tumor growth and cancer cell dissemination.1,2 The matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) family plays the pivotal role
in ECM remodeling, leading to cancer cell invasion.3 In general, the active MMP2 is responsible for degrading
type IV collagen. However, in tumorigenesis, abnormal MMP2 expression
is associated with cancer cell motility and angiogenesis.4−6 MMP2 overexpression significantly promoted the lymphatic metastasis
in oral cancer patients.7 Administration
of MMP2 microRNA could be an adjuvant to inhibit mouse glioma in radiotherapy.8 An MMP2-sensitive paclitaxel prodrug could maintain
anticancer activity by increasing permeability, cancer cell targeting,
and retention effect.9 A self-assembly
nanodrug that conjugated an amphiphilic molecule and antitumor drug
by an MMP2-sensitive peptide was suggested to have the potential in
clinical translation to increase the biocompatibility and reduce the
side effects of drug accumulation.10 A
photosensitizer therapeutic agent was conjugated with MMP2-cleavable
peptide and then modified with PEG to form a self-assembled and redox-responsive
system for fluorescent monitoring and photodynamic therapy.11 The pterostilbene compound that blocked the
MMP2-induced signal pathway suppressed the oral cancer cell invasion.12 The MMP2 antibody labeled with the Cy5 probe
could be used in in vivo animal imaging.13 Thus, an MMP2-senstive probe has potential in
cancer metastasis theranostics.

Lanthanide-doped upconversion
nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been extensively
investigated according to its unique photochemistry.14 By NIR excitation, UCNP emits an antistoke type and split
emissions at UV/visible spectra. Upconversion luminescence is triggered
by sensitizer (Yb3+) and emitters (Er3+ and
Tm3+) under 980 nm irradiation.15 Moreover, a core/shell UCNP emits upconversion luminescence by an
808 nm laser.16 After PEG coating, UCNP-based
nanomaterial can catch protein for bioanalytical applications.17 The core/shell UCNP coated with iron and organic
compounds shows a tumor-specific targeting ability.18 Yao et al. showed that an UCNP-assisted liposome drug delivery
system could overcome drug resistance and release drug by a NIR trigger.19 A CdTeS QD has been shown to have potential
for biosensor detection of MMP2 secretion in vitro and in vivo.20 The copper
indium sulfide (CIS) QD is more biocompatible than other QDs.21 CIS QD is a I–III–V ternary semiconductor.22 CIS QD has the dramatic advantages in tunable
photoluminescence and high quantum yield. However, the hydrophobic
property limited its bioapplication. The cytotoxicity of CIS/ZnS QD
with chitosan coating has been determined by long-term incubation
with C. elegans.23 The
silica-encapsulated CIS/ZnS QD remains an excellent optical property
with hydrophilic ability.24

Optical
imaging is a considerable strategy in medical diagnostics
because of its noninvasiveness, sensitivity, and convenience. However,
the tissue penetration is an Achilles’ heel for the optical
diagnostic tool.25 The penetration depth
increased depending on increasing wavelength, except the 900–1000
nm.26 The penetration of laser light at
808 and 980 nm reached 3.4 and 2.2 cm, respectively.27 The decrease of penetration depth at 900–1000 nm
was due to water absorption, suggesting that the 808 nm irradiation
has potential in biomedical application.28 This study demonstrated a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based
(FRET) nanocomposite consisting of UCNP, MMP2-sensitive peptide, and
CIS/ZnS QD, named UCNP@p-QD. The core/shell UCNP contributed NIR-induced
upconversion energy to CIS/ZnS QD with red-visible emission. We showed
that UCNP@p-QD was a biocompatible nanocomposite, and it responded
to the MMP2 protein in oral cancer cells and the animal tumor model.

Results
and Discussion
In this study, we developed a FRET-based nanocomposite
that detected
MMP2 expression in vivo. This nanocomposite consists
of UCNP and CIS/ZnS QDs, which were linked by an MMP2-sensitive peptide
(Figure 1a). UCNP@p-QD
has FRET-induced red fluorescence by 808 nm irradiation. This nanocomposite
revealed the blue fluorescence in the presence of MMP2. At first,
we fabricated a core/shell type NaYF4:Yb/Tm@NaYF4:Yb/Nd UCNP. The core was NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ that emitted multifluorescence under NIR irradiation. The
data of the hexagonal β-NaYF4 database (JCPDS 16-0334) were
compared with NaYF4:Yb,Tm and NaYF4:Yb,Tm. The
diffraction peaks were similar to those of the standard peaks (Figure 1b). UCNPs were uniform
in aqueous solution of which the diameter was approximately 20 nm
(Figure 1c). Doped
with Yb3+ and Nd3+, the core/shell type, which
formed a hexagonal structure, was in response to 808 nm excitation.
In order to graft the MMP2-sensitive peptide, UCNP was modified with
primary amine on the SiO2 layer.29 The SiO2 absorption was revealed at 1100 cm–1 compared to ligand-free UCNP (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). The absorption of UCNP@p at the Si–O–Si
(1100 cm–1), N–C=O (1660 cm–1), and C–O (1100–1350 cm–1) corresponded
with the standard curve of UCNP and peptide. The SiO2-coated
UCNP showed the size of 25 nm ±1 nm (Figure 1d). The N-terminal part from UCNP embedded
a cysteine residue, to which the QD conjugated through disulfide linkage.30 X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the CIS/ZnS showed
the major peaks corresponding to the standard diffraction patterns
of CIS crystal (JCPDS No. 85-1175) and ZnS crystal (JCPDS No. 77-2100)
at 27°, 47°, and 55° (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). The CIS/ZnS QD is a stable and biocompatible
nanoparticle that is appropriate to bioapplication.23 The distance between QD and UCNP was close to 10 nm that
was FRET allowed between donor and acceptor. UCNP@p-QD was approximate
to 30 nm in size (Figure 1e). CIS/ZnS QD with size of 3.5 nm ± 0.2 nm was surrounded
around the UCNP@p (inset, Figure 1e). The EDS analysis indicated that QDs were bound
tightly with UCNP (Figure S1c, Supporting Information), in which the elements of QDs, such as In, S, and Cu, were located
next to the elemental cluster within Nd and Yb. Moreover, the elements
of UCNP and CIS/ZnS QD were identified from the conjugated structure
using elemental mapping (Figure 1f). According to the elemental distribution, the fluorine
(F), yttrium (Y), and neodymium (Nd) elements of UCNP appeared in
the core, while the indium (In) of CIS/ZnS QD was distributed in the
periphery (Figure 1g).

the same proportions in EDS mapping analysis.

UCNP showed antistoke shift fluorescence under 808 nm laser
irradiation
(Figure 2a). The Nd3+ ion was a sensitizer, in which the electron was excited
from the ground state to the excited state.31 Meanwhile, a nonradiative energy transfers to the excited level 2F5/2 of Yb3+. The excited state of Tm3+ has four energy relaxations at wavelengths of 340, 360,
450, and 475 nm. 340 and 360 nm were due to the electronic transition 1I6 → 3F4 and 1D2 → 3H6. The blue-visible
light was contributed by transitions of 1D2 → 3F4 and 1G4 → 3H6. QD has a broad absorption below 500 nm and
has red fluorescence emission at 625 nm (Figure 2b). QD showed an orange emission under UV
irradiation (inset, Figure 2b). To develop not only high penetration of excitation source
but also a red shift, the fluorophore is desired for clinical use.
UCNP acted as a donor that was excited by 808 nm irradiation. The
acceptor CIS/ZnS QD that was excited by the upconversion fluorescence
was a red fluorophore. The FRET process was manifested by the fact
that the fluorescence intensity of the UV and visible-light spectrum
showed a gradual decrease depending on increasing QD concentration
(Figure 2c). To delineate
the FRET dynamic change, we focused on the wavelengths at 475 and
600 nm, to which UCNP and QD contributed, respectively (Figure S2a, Supporting Information). The red fluorescence
revealed at 25 mg/mL of QD conjugation implied a threshold of FRET-induced
red fluorescence. Furthermore, the zeta-potential analysis indicated
that the positive charge of UCNP@p decreased by the increasing QDs
(Figure S2b, Supporting Information). Since
the CIS/ZnS QD was hydrophobic, it dissolved in organic solvent rather
than in H2O. We then modified the UCNP@p-QD synthesis process
by PEGlyation onto the surface of the QD.32 PEGlyation was carried out by methyl-PEG4-thiol and carboxy-PEG12-thiol, which increased the hydrophilicity and minimized
nonspecific binding (Figure S2c, Supporting Information). The 2853 and 2925 cm–1 were from the methylene-stretching
group of PEG. The emission of UCNP@p-QD with 808 nm irradiation is
similar to QD under UV excitation. The PEGlyated UCNP@p-QD has orange
fluorescence at wavelength of 550 nm (Figure 2d). Obviously, there is about a 100 nm blue
shift after PEGlyation. Park et al. suggested that cation exchange
could promote a blue shift in emission.33 Ryu et al. suggested that the addition of surfactant could contribute
to the blue shift.34 In our experimental
result, the surface reconstruction of UCNP@p-QD led to an apparent
blue-shift emission. The blue-shift mechanism should be further demonstrated.

(d) The normalized PL spectra of QD, UCNP@p-QD, UCNP@p-QD*, UCNP,
and UCNP*. The attached symbol (*) indicated UCNP@p-QD decorated with

for unconjugated QD (360 nm excitation).

We soaked 10 μg of UCNP@QD into 1 mL of PBS at different
pH values of 2, 4, 7, 9, and 12, respectively (Figure S3a, Supporting Information). Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) showed that the hydration radii between pH 4 and pH 9 were not
obviously changed, implying that UCNP@p-QD was stable in biological
solution. UCNP@p-QD (0.2 mg/mL) was incubated with different concentration
of MMP2 (Figure S3b, Supporting Information). The 600 and 475 nm emissions delineated a FRET change that originated
from QD and UCNP, respectively. The fluctuations showed that the FRET-induced
fluorescence (600 nm) gradually decreased; meanwhile, upconversion
fluorescence (475 nm) increased depending on increasing rhMMP2 (Figure 3a). The recovery
of upconversion fluorescence indicated that MMP2-sensitive peptides
were digested, and then QDs were separated from UCNP. The FRET-induced
and upconversion fluorescence were simultaneously detected at the
interval of 10–5 to 10–2 pg/mL.
In the concentration of 10–1 mg/mL, the intensity
of upconversion fluorescence reached a plateau, and the FRET-induced
red fluorescence declined to the zero, indicating that the 0.2 mg/mL
of UCNP@p-QD could be the effective dose. In time-dependent rhMMP2
digestion, the FRET was consistently expressed until the cleavage
time reached 60 min (Figure S3c, Supporting Information). Not only the increase of upconversion fluorescence but also the
decrease of FRET-induced fluorescence showed exponential fluctuations.
The FRET-induced fluorescence severely decreased between 0 and 20
min. The upconversion fluorescence intensity was retrieved serially
along with reaction time until a plateau at 100 min (Figure 3b). The FRET elimination of
UCNP@p-QD showed the presence of rhMMP2. This implied the UCNP@p-QD
could be employed in clinical MMP2 detection such as a blood specimen.

Figure 3 Photoluminescence
analysis showed the FRET change of UCNP@p-QD
in the presence of rhMMP2 under 808 nm irradiation. The blue line
indicated the visible fluorescence of UCNP at 475 nm, and the red
line indicated the FRET-induced florescence at 600 nm. (a) UCNP@p-QD
was incubated with different concentrations of rhMMP2. The concentration
of rhMMP2 was 0, 10–6, 10–5, 10–4, 10–3, 10–2,
10–1, and 1 pg/mL, respectively. (b) The time-lapse
PL analysis showed that UCNP@p-QD was incubated with 1 pg/mL of rhMMP2.
The checkpoint was 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min.

The cell viability analysis showed that UCNP@p-QD
could be biocompatible
to oral cancer cells (Figure S4a, Supporting Information). The high dose of UCNP@p-QD reduced 5% viabilities of FADU and
OEC-M1. This implied that 83 μg/mL of dosage was safe to FADU
and OEC-M1 cells rather than 250 μg/mL. The 808 nm laser showed
a little phototoxicity (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). Moreover, a high dose of UCNP@p-QD showed little
toxicity to Cal27 cells (Figure S4c, Supporting Information). To our knowledge, CIS/ZnS QD was safe for C. elegan.23 The cover of the QD might reduce certain cytotoxicity from UCNP@p
because the increasing UCNP@p revealed toxicity (Figure S4d, Supporting Information). Thus, UCNP@p-QD was
biocompatible to cells.

The extracellular UCNP@p-QD showed red
emission under 808 nm irradiation.
After MMP2 digestion, the UCNP@p showed blue upconversion fluorescence
(Figure 4a). To detect
the MMP2 in the cell model, constituted MMP2-overexpressing cells
(Cal27/MMP2) and their cognate cells (Cal27/VC) were cultured for
UCNP@p-QD detection. Cal27/MMP2 overexpressed the MMP2 protein not
only in cytoplasm but also in the culture medium.35 The FRET-induced red fluorescence showed in Cal27/VC but
also in Cal27/MMP2 (Figure 4b). The UCNP@p-QD accumulated around Cal27/VC cells, indicating
there was no MMP2 expression; oppositely, the FRET-induced fluorescence
was significantly reduced in Cal27/MMP2. Moreover, UCNP@p-QD showed
the same consequence in OEC-M1 and FADU cells (Figure S5, Supporting Information), which were MMP2-null
and MMP2-overexpressing cells, respectively.35 This result indicated that UCNP@p-QD could be detected in extracellular
MMP2. The effective penetration is usually an obstacle for scientists
to develop the photodependent biosensors, so the high penetrating
infrared has attracted the attention of investigators.

Figure 4 (a) Schematic illustration
indicating the FRET change of UCNP@p-QD
in the presence of MMP2. (b) In vivo MMP2 sensitivity
of UCNP@p-QD was performed in Cal27/VC and Cal27/MMP2. The FRET change
showed FRET-induced fluorescence (600 nm) and upconversion fluorescence
(475 nm) were discriminately expressed by MMP2 alternation. Dynamic
tracking of UCNP@p-QD performed in the mouse tumor model. The scale
bar represents 50 μm. (c) By intratumoral injection, UCNP@p-QD
was administrated into Cal27/VC (left side of mice) and Cal27/MMP2
(right side of mice) induced tumors. FRET-induced images were detected
at 1 h, 8 h, 16 h, and 48 h under 808 nm irradiation. (d) FRET change,
focusing on 475 and 600 nm, was observed from a tumor section that
was stained with propidium iodide (PI). These tumor sections were
prepared from NO.1 mouse. The scale bar represents 50 μm.

In order to take an in
vivo image, we refitted
an  optical imaging system to employ the upconversion luminescence
detection (Figure S6a, Supporting Information). Under 808 nm irradiation, the FRET-induced fluorescence was detected
on the separated dorsal side within 1 h (Figure 4c; column 1H). Distribution of UCNP@p-QD
was visualized uniformly in tumor and its adjacent part. Additionally,
the RFP-harbor Cal27/VC cell could be specifically examined on the
left dorsal side (Figure S6b, Supporting Information). The FRET-induced fluorescence significantly decreased over time
in Cal27/MMP2-induced tumors (1H to 48H). Finally, the FRET-induced
fluorescence almost disappeared from the Cal27/MMP2-induced tumor
part (Figure 4c; column
48H). Although there is a little FRET-induced fluorescence from Cal27/MMP2-induced
tumor (Figure 4c; NO.3),
most UCNP@p-QDs were significantly degraded by MMP2. The harvested
tumors showed the similar size and pathological feature between Cal27/VC-
and Cal27/MMP2-induced tumors (Figures S6c and S6d, Supporting Information). Because the blue-visible filter is
not equipped in an in vivo imaging system, the tumor
sections were examined using a multiphoton microscope (Figure 4d). The UCNP@p-QDs were shown
ubiquitously in the Cal27/VC tumor tissue. Oppositely, the upconversion
fluorescence was detected in the Cal27/MMP2 tumor. Hence, UCNP@p-QD
detected not only rhMMP2 protein in vitro but also
MMP2 expression in the cell model and animal tumor imaging.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated a FRET-based nanocomposite comprising
an 808 nm-induced upconversion nanoparticle, the core/shell type of
CIS/ZnS quantum dot, and the MMP2-sensitive peptide, named UCNP@p-QD.
Upconversion fluorescence from UCNP was excited by 808 nm laser irradiation
which is known for low phototoxicity and high penetration. Consequently,
the upconversion fluorescence transferred to CIS/ZnS QD and showed
red fluorescence at 600 nm. We demonstrated that NIR laser energy
was transferred to FRET-induced fluorescence though an antistokes
shift and then a stokes shift process. This improved the poor upconversion
fluorescence of UCNP by using CIS/ZnS QDs. The in vitro experiment characterized that UCNP@p-QD was susceptible to rhMMP2
proteinase with high sensitivity and selectivity. Because the FRET-based
UCNP@p-QD was biocompatible in cell viability assay, we employed UCNP@p-QD
in determining MMP2 expression in the cell model. Furthermore, the
biosensor was used to monitor the MMP2-induced tumor in an in vivo
mouse tumor model. The FRET-based nanocomposite would be worthy to
further investigate by replacing other specific enzyme-sensitive peptides
in clinical diagnostics.

Preparation of NaYF4:Yb/Tm@NaYF4:Yb/Nd
The core particles,
NaYF4:Yb/Tm, were synthesized by
the coprecipitation method under high-temperature reaction. Amounts
of 0.4 mL of Tm(CH3CO2)3·H2O, Yb(CH3CO2)3·4H2O, and Y(CH3CO2)3·H2O were dissolved in a mixture of OA (6 mL) and ODE (14 mL)
at 120 °C for 30 min. The dissolved salts immediately cooled
to room temperature, and methanol solution with NH4F (0.15
g) and NaOH (0.1 g) was added with vigorous stirring. The reaction
mixture was heated to 290 °C for 2 h and was returned to room
temperature. Nanoparticle precipates were washed with cyclohexane
by centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 5 min and were resuspended with methaonl.
The shell precusors were syntheized by Nd(CH3CO2)3 (0.48 mmol), Yb(CH3CO2)3 (0.48 mmol), and Y(CH3CO2)3 (1.28
mmol) as well as the process of NaYF4:Yb/Tm synthesis.
The core NaYF4:Yb/Tm particles were embedded in NaYF4:Yb/Nd nanoparticles in methanol with NH4F (0.15
g) and NaOH (0.1 g). The reaction was performed at 290 °C for
2 h, and the core–shell upconversion nanoparticles were obtained
in cyclohexane after ethanol washing.

Preparation of UCNP@p-QD
The core–shell types
of UCNPs consisting of NaYF4:Yb/Tm (core) and NaYF4:Yb/Nd (shell) were synthesized by the modified coprecipitation
method.36 The UCNPs were then coated with
a silica shed and surface modified with an amino group. The MMP2-sensitive
peptide was conjugated to UCNP through the amino group. The core/shell
quantum dot that consists of CuInS2 (core) and ZnS (shell)
was prepared by a modified hydrothermal method.23 UCNP@p was conjugated with the CIS/ZnS QD in DMSO/chloroform
solution (1:5) for 24 h conjugation because of disulfide binding.35 The folic acid (10 nM) was further conjugated
onto UCNP@p-QD using the NHS/EDC method. The upconversion nanoparticles
were coated with silica shed using a modified microemulsion method.
The water-soluble NaYF4:Yb/Tm@NaYF4:Yb/Nd particles
were reconsitiued by alcohol-diluted HCl washing that removed the
OA and ODE ligands and were dissolved in the mixture of IGEPAL CO-520
(1 mL) and cyclohexane (10 mL) with vigorous stirring for 4 h. Subsequently,
the pH value was adjusted by NH4OH (0.1 mL) solution, and
the reaction was stirred for one additional hour. Finally, the tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%, 30 μL) was slowly added into the reaction
mixture by the speed of 40 μL per hour for further 24 h stirring.
The silica-coated nanoparticles were modified with an amino group
by adding APTES (0.1 mL). The nanoparticles were collected by methanol
precipation using centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 20 min. The MMP2-senstive
peptide with a sequence of CSGAVRWLLTA was activated for 2 h by a
mass proporation of peptide, NHS, and EDC of 5:1.5:1, respectively,
in DMSO. Active peptides were grafted onto the amino group of silica-coated
nanoparticles by the NHS/EDC method to form the peptide-grafted upconversion
nanoparticle (UCNP@p). The UCNP@p was dissolved in DMSO. To manifest
the FRET process, UCNP@p (0.5 mg/mL) was conjugated with a different
concentration of QD in DMSO/chloroform solution (5:1).

Surface Modification
of UCNP@p-QD
CIS QD was synthesized
using the DDT, on which the ZnS was coated to form a core/shell type
nanoparticle. Since the DDT was hydrophobic, the CIS/ZnS QDs were
dissolved in chloroform before use. UCNP@p-QD (100 mg) was PEGlyated
using methyl-PEG4-thiol (100 ng) and carboxy-PEG12-thiol (500 ng) in DMSO/chloroform solution (1:10) for 30 min. The
UCNP@p-QD was then washed by chloroform DMSO washing and was dissolved
in ddH2O. The photoluminescence of nanoparticles was detected
by Fluoromax 3. The morphology was determined using the JEM-2100F
(TEM, Japan) and JEOL transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Japan).
The electron gun of TEM and HRTEM worked at 80 and 200 keV, respectively.
Zeta potential of conjugated nanocomposite was characterized at room
temperature (RT) by a Malvern Zetasizer 3000.

Cell Culture
Oral
cancer cell lines were cultured in
a growth medium with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin–glutamine.
The cell lines were cultured according to ATCC instruction. The cells
were incubated in a CO2 incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cal27 and FADU were purchased from the ATCC
cell line bank. The control vector (VC), pLAS3w.RFP-C.Ppuro, was purchased
from RNAicore facility (Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Cal27/MMP2 overexpressed
MMP2 due to the lentiviral infection, at which the viruses were prepared
by pLAS3W::MMP2.puro. Cal27/VC was introduced to the similar lentivirus
DNA backbone that replaced the MMP2 reading frame with the frame of
the red fluorescent protein (pLAS3w.RFP-C.Ppuro). The opposite Cal27/VC
stable cell line expressed the RFP protein due to administration of
the pLAS3w.RFP-C.Ppuro-prepared lentivirus infection (RNAicore, Academia
Sinica, Taiwan).

Cytoxicity Assay of UCNP@p-QD
The
stable cell lines
of Cal27/VC and Cal27/MMP2 were performed in MMP2 sensing.35 Cytotoxicity was evaluated by an alamar-blue
assay using SpectraMax M2.37 An aliquot
of 2000 cells was added in a 96-well plate. An aliquot of UCNP@p-QD
was added with serial dilution (250, 83, 27, 9, 3, and 1 μg/mL)
for 72 h of incubation. The cytotoxic data were assessed from six
independent tests with the standard deviation.

In Vitro and in Vivo MMP2
Detection
To perform the sensing ability of UCNP@p-QD, rhMMP2
was employed in dose- and time-dependent verification at 37 °C
incubation. The aliquot of rhMMP2 was added in 0.2 mg/mL of UCNP.
In dose-dependent experiment, the rhMMP2 was serially diluted with
1, 10–1, 10–2, 10–3, 10–4, 10–5, and 10–6 pg/mL. The 10–3 pg/mL of rhMMP2 was employed in
a time-lapse FRET change. The time course of the FRET change was carried
out with 0.2 mg/mL of UCNP@p-QD with 1 pg/mL of rhMMP2. To depict
the FRET change, we focused on the fluorescence emission at 475 and
600 nm, which were donated from UCNP and UCNP@p-QD, respectively.
The data of three individual tests showed the means with standard
derivation.

To explore in vivo MMP2 sensitivity
of UCNP@p-QD, an MMP2-overexpressing stable cell line was employed
compared to its cognate cell. Aliquot 20000 cells were seeded onto
the coverslips for overnight incubation, and the UCNP@p-QD (10 μg/mL)
was added for a further 12 h incubation. The cell and tissue images
were obtained using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope with multiphoton
laser supplement.

Detection of MMP2 in the Mouse Xenograft
Tumor Model
The animal experiments was approved by Academia
Sinica Institutional
Animal Care and Utilization Committee. The 5 × 106 aliquot of Cal27/VC and Cal27/MMP2 cells was subcutaneously injected
on both opposite dorsal sides of the NSG mouse at 6-weeks old.38 After 4 weeks of tumor growth (62.5 mm3 of tumor volume), UCNP@p-QD (20 mg/mL) was administrated on both
tumors by intratumoral injection. The real-time images were obtained
using In-Vivo Xtreme (Bruker, Germany), with an additional 808 nm
infrared diode laser module (1.50 W). The RFP acquisition was detected
at 600 nm using 540 nm excitation. Xenograft tumors were harvested
using a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded method. The tumor section
was stained with propidium iodide (1 μg/mL) according to instruction.
The images were obtained by confocal microscopy.
