N-Alkylation
of 2-azidobenzenesulfonamide with 5-bromopent-1-ene
gave an N-pentenyl sulfonamide, which underwent intramolecular
aminohydroxylation to give an N-(2-azidoaryl)sulfonyl
prolinol, a precursor for the synthesis of a pyrrolobenzothiadiazepine.
The attempted N-alkylation of 2-azidobenzamide gave a separable mixture
(∼1:1) of a benzotriazinone and a quinazolinone in a 72% combined
yield. Other primary alkyl halides (3 examples) gave similar mixtures
of benzotriazinones and quinazolinones. Benzylic, allylic, and secondary
and tertiary alkyl halides (5 examples) gave only benzotriazinones
in moderate yields. The results of mechanistic studies show the likely
involvement of nitrene intermediates in the quinazolinone pathway
and a second pathway involving a dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylsulfide-mediated
conversion of 2-azidobenzamide into benzotriazinones.

Introduction
Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) 1 are a class
of natural products that have attracted a great
deal of interest1 because of their ability
to function as sequence-selective DNA-interactive molecules.2−4 PBD derivatives have entered phase II clinical trials as antitumor
compounds5 and have also attracted attention
as antibiotics with a novel mode of action.6 Pyrrolo[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzothiadiazepines (PBTDs) 2 are attracting interest as PBD analogues,7 non-nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitors,8 antischistosomals,9 and Glut-1 transporter inhibitors (compound 3)10 and are emerging as a potential treatment for
chronic leukemia (compound 4).11−13

Almost all approaches toward the synthesis of PBDs and PBTDs
use l-proline-derived starting materials, meaning that the
de novo
synthesis of the pyrrolidine ring is a rare approach to the PBDs and
a very rare approach to the PBTDs. Metathesis,14 intramolecular lactam formation,15 reductive cyclization,16,17 cyclization–elimination,18 and ring contraction of 1,2-thiazines10,19 are approaches to the PBDs that involve five-membered ring construction.
Only the latter has been applied for the synthesis of PBTDs. With
this in mind, we became interested in using intramolecular aminohydroxylation
to construct a functionalized pyrrolidine derivative, which would
then act as a precursor to the PBTDs or PBDs. Intramolecular aminohydroxylation
of alkenes is an area of recent interest in heterocyclic synthesis
and has been used to access simple prolinol derivatives.20−22 Using this, our initial hypothesis (Figure 1) was that the N-(pent-4-en-1-yl)azidobenzenesulfonamide 5 and N-(pent-4-en-1-yl)azidobenzamide 6 would undergo aminohydroxylation to yield N-arylazido-substituted prolinols 7 and 8, respectively, which could then be used to synthesize PBDs and PBTDs.

aim of the current work.

Results and Discussion
We synthesized N-(pent-4-en-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide 5 from the reaction
of 2-azidobenzenesulfonamide 9 with 5-bromopentene (21%)
or from the reaction of 2-azidobenzenesulfonyl
chloride 10 with pent-4-en-1-amine (63%), as shown in Scheme 1. Pent-4-en-1-amine
was synthesized from 5-bromopentene.23 The
sulfonyl chloride 10 was synthesized using diazotization
and azidation of 2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid 11 followed
by the treatment of 2-azidobenzenesulfonic acid 12 with
thionyl chloride.10,24 2-Azidobenzenesulfonamide 9 was synthesized by reacting the sulfonyl chloride 10 with ammonia or from the diazotization and azidation of
2-aminobenzenesulfonamide 15, which was produced from
2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride 13 via the sulfonamide 14.10,24

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Aminohydroxylation
Precursor 5
Reagents and conditions:
(a)
NH3 (aq); (b) Pd/C, NH2NH2; (c) (i)
NaNO2, HCl (aq) and (ii) NaN3, NaOAc (aq); (d)
5-bromopentene, base, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); (e) (i) NaNO2, HCl (aq) and (ii) NaN3, NaOAc (aq); (f) SOCl2, reflux; (g) pent-4-en-1-amine;23 and (h) NH3 (aq).

For the intramolecular
aminohydroxylation, we found that Oxone
in the presence of tosic acid as an electrophilic oxidant system,
as reported previously by Togo20 for nonazido
substrates, worked well for our azido substrate 5. The
desired prolinol 7 (Scheme 2) was produced over repeated attempts in
an 83–95% yield. As far as we are aware, this is the first
reported example of such a reaction having been performed with an
azide group present.

Scheme 2 Intramolecular Aminohydroxylation to Form
PBTD Precursor 7
In our previous studies,10,25 we reported
the synthesis
of the Glut-1 transporter-inhibiting triazolo-PBTD 3 as
a single enantiomer from the enantiopure version of alcohol 7, which we derived from l-prolinol. The formation
of racemic alcohol 7 gave us the opportunity to provide
a sample of racemic 3. Thus, as shown in Scheme 3, alcohol 7 was
oxidized to give aldehyde 16 (96%), which was converted
into alkyne 17 using the Bestmann–Ohira reagent 18. Intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition occurred spontaneously
to furnish the racemic PBTD derivative 3 in a 70% yield
from aldehyde 16.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Triazolo-PBTD 3
With a successful PBTD system
in hand (Figure 1,
X = SO2), we next attempted
to synthesize the analogous PBD system using the same approach (Figure 1, X = CO). 2-Azidobenzoyl
chloride was prepared in two steps from anthranilic acid26−28 and converted into secondary amide 6 by reaction with
pent-4-en-1-amine.23 Attempted intramolecular
aminohydroxylation failed to deliver the desired N-arylazido substituted 8. As shown in Scheme 4, we also attempted to form
compound 6 by the reaction of 2-azidobenzamide 20 with 5-bromopentene 19 in DMSO in the presence
of a base, a reaction that had worked with 2-azidobenzenesulfonamide
(Scheme 1). This did
not produce N-(pent-4-en-1-yl)benzamide 6 but instead led to some unexpected results (also shown in Scheme 4). Thus, under a
variety of conditions, we observed the formation of a mixture of benzotriazinone 21 and quinazolinone 22. The use of anhydrous
DMSO as the solvent, sodium carbonate as the base, and a temperature
of 95 °C allowed an optimized combined yield of 72% (isolated
yields of 39% for compound 21 and 33% for compound 22) with 4% recovery of the starting material 20 and the formation of 15% of the reduced product, 2-aminobenzamide 23.

Scheme 4 Formation of Benzotriazinone 21 and Quinazolinone 22
We decided to explore
this process in more detail (Scheme 5) with respect to the substrate
scope of the organohalide. The reaction of 2-azidobenzamide with 4-bromobutene
gave benzotriazinone 26 (35%) and quinazolinone 24 (29%), whereby the expected quinazolinone 25 underwent a facile double-bond migration to give conjugated 24. The recovered starting material 20 (8%) and
2-aminobenzamide 23 (14%) were also present and were
also formed in all other reactions shown in Scheme 5. 1-Bromobutane and 1-bromopropane gave benzotriazinones 27 and 28, respectively, again as mixtures with
the respective quinazolinones. Benzyl bromide, 2-bromopropane, and
bromocyclohexane did not form quinazolinones, giving only benzotriazinones 29–31, respectively. 2-Bromo-2-methylpropane
behaved unexpectedly and gave benzotriazinone 32 in a
30% yield, a reaction that is discussed later. The identical benzotriazinone 32 was formed in a 36% yield from the reaction of 2-azidobenzamide
with 3-bromo-2-methylprop-1-ene. Attempts to optimize these reactions
further were unsuccessful: other solvents (see below) did not react;
other bases (Et3N, DBU, DABCO, and pyridine) and/or reduced
temperatures gave reduced yields; and increased temperatures gave
increased degradation resulting in reduced yields of benzotriazinones
and quinazolinones, together with higher yields of the reduced product
2-aminobenzamide 23. (Bromomethylene)dibenzene was unreactive
toward the azide but was converted into benzophenone 33, whereas trityl bromide was unreactive and furnished triphenyl methanol 34.

Scheme 5 Reaction of Alkyl Halides with 2-Azidobenzamide
Scheme 6 shows our
suggested mechanism for the formation of quinazolinones. We consider
that nitrene 35 (path A) reacts with the alkyl halide
to form intermediate 36 (path A1), which undergoes
hydrogen radical extrusion to form imine 37. Cyclization
gives the dihydroquinazoline species 38, and loss of
hydrogen would form the final quinazolinone. This pathway also explains
the formation of 2-aminobenzamide due to nitrene 35 abstracting
hydrogen from the reaction medium (path A2). Generation
of nitrenes from aryl azides in solvents at temperatures below 100
°C,29,30 including DMSO,31 is known. There is an alternative route whereby nitrene formation
is preceded by N-alkylation of the amide nitrogen to give compound 6 (see earlier for structure and synthesis). However, we saw
no evidence for the formation of compound 6 using thin-layer
chromatography (TLC). Compound 6 also failed to give
quinazolinones under our reaction conditions. Quinazolinones are important
and well-known heterocycles32−36 that are synthesized by a variety of routes including an iron-catalyzed
intramolecular C–N bond formation from N,N-disubstituted 2-azidobenzamides36 and from dihydroquinazolinones formed from 2-aminobenzamides
and aldehydes using DMSO as a mild oxidant,37,38 providing some precedent for our suggested mechanism. We speculated
that our process may occur via the formation of 2-aminobenzamide 23 from the azide and subsequent reaction with the alkyl halide
to give intermediate 39, which could then form species 36. However, when 2-aminobenzamide was used as the starting
material in the place of 2-azidobenzamide, the reaction was not seen.
We also thought it was possible that DMSO could generate an aldehyde
from the alkyl halide and that this aldehyde was reacting with either
starting material 20 or with 2-aminobenzamide 23 (paths B and A2b in Scheme 6). We exclude these two paths because (i)
the introduction of the relevant aldehyde into the system had no influence
and (ii) our reaction was very sensitive to water (anhydrous DMSO
was necessary) and the paths B and A2b both generate water.
Path B also supposes the formation of an N-acyl imine
by the reaction of 2-azidobenzamide with an aldehyde, a conversion
that we have been unable to achieve. Thus, it appears that 2-azidobenzamide 20 forms nitrene 35 under our reaction conditions
and goes on to form quinazolinones via path A1 and 2-aminobenzamide 23 via path A2. The secondary amide 6 did not react in this way. Interestingly, when we subjected a tertiary
amide, compound 40 (Scheme 7), to the same reaction conditions, we isolated
the disubstituted dihydroquinazolinone 41, in line with
the literature precedent for tertiary amides.36

Scheme 6 Mechanisms to Explain Quinazolinone Formation
Scheme 7 Formation of a Dihydroquinazolinone
Scheme 8 shows our
mechanism for the formation of benzotriazinones 26–32. 3-Substituted 1,2,3-benzotriazin-4-ones are useful targets
in medicinal chemistry39−41 and as synthetic intermediates.42,43 The most common route to 3-substituted 1,2,3-benzotriazin-4-ones
is diazotization of the relevant N-substituted anthranilamide.39−42 For our mechanism, we suggest that compound 42 (Scheme 8) is an intermediate.
When this readily available44 compound
was used as the starting material in our reaction, the same benzotriazinones
could be isolated. N-Alkylation of benzotriazinone 42 is a known route to N-alkyl benzotriazinones.45 2-Azidobenzamide 20 has an azide
group, which can be stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond
that renders the azide susceptible to nucleophilic attack followed
by alkylation. Such processes have precedent in azide chemistry.46−49 Loss of the azide terminal nitrogen is then facilitated, allowing
the formation of a diazonium species, which can cyclize to give intermediate 42. As discussed previously, we were able to isolate significant
quantities of benzophenone 33 from the reaction mixture
when (bromomethylene)dibenzene was used as the alkyl halide. We also
isolated triphenyl methanol when trityl bromide was used. DMSO was
the only solvent in which we observed a reaction [dimethylformamide
(DMF), nitromethane, chloroform, and toluene gave no reaction]. This
leads us to suggest that ketones or aldehydes plus dimethylsulfide
form from the known reaction of alkyl halides and DMSO,50 and so, we favor dimethylsulfide as the nucleophile,
as shown in Scheme 8. This process consumes 2 equiv of alkyl halide, which is consistent
with our observation that excess alkyl halide is needed (see Experimental Section). An alternative mechanism
for benzotriazinone formation is for N-alkylation to precede the nucleophilic
attack at the azide, but this would involve N-alkylation of the amide
nitrogen as discussed and dismissed for the quinazolinone mechanism
shown in Scheme 6.

Scheme 8 Proposed Mechanism for Benzotriazinone Formation
The unexpected formation of benzotriazinone 32 (see Scheme 5) from 2-bromo-2-methylpropane
can be explained by a combination of the mechanisms shown in Schemes 6 and 8. Thus, as shown in Scheme 9, alkoxysulfonium salt formation and elimination would
generate 2-methylpropene, a process that has precedent.51,52 The interception of a free radical species by benzotriazinone 42 would generate the free radical intermediate 43, which could then react with 2-methylpropene to form intermediate 44, which would yield benzotriazinone 32 after
the loss of a hydrogen radical.

Scheme 9 Proposed Mechanism to Account for
the Formation of Benzotriazinone 32
Conclusions
A new approach to the
synthesis of pyrrolobenzothiadiazepine nucleus
has been presented that relies upon the formation of a racemic proline
derivative using the previously unreported intramolecular aminohydroxylation
of an N-alkenylated 2-azidobenzenesulfonamide. We are currently working
to expand the scope of this process by applying it to other N-alkenylated
2-azidobenzenesulfonamide substrates. Attempts to form the corresponding
N-alkenylated 2-azidobenzamides led to mixtures of benzotriazinones
and benzoquinazolines, which were formed from an unusual process that
allowed us to hypothesize a nitrene-based pathway to the benzoquinazolines
and a pathway to the benzotriazinones that involves the conversion
of an azide into a diazonium via nucleophilic attack on the azide.
Our work offers some useful and interesting mechanistic insights into
organoazide chemistry and organosulfur chemistry.

in the literature.
The methods that we used to access racemic (16) and (3) are methods that we developed previously to produce enantiopure
(16) and (3).10,25 Enantiopure
compound (7) is also known10,25 but was previously
accessed using chemistry different from the new method that is reported
for racemic (7) below. The synthesis of benzotriazinones
(28),54 (29),44 and (30)54 have been reported previously but with no data and via a different
route. Other routes to 2-ethylquinazolin-4(3H)-one,55 2-propylquinazolin-4(3H)-one,55 and 2-(1′-propen-1′-yl)-quinazolinone
(24)56 have been reported.

at reflux in a 2 M solution of (COCl)2 in dichloromethane
(5.0 mL, 10.0 mmol) with a drop of DMF under an inert atmosphere of
nitrogen for 5 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature before
the crude acid chloride was concentrated, and the residue was washed
with dichloromethane (2 × 20 mL) to give crude 2-azidobenzoyl
chloride as a dark brown solid. One portion of a solution of potassium
carbonate (1.10 g, 8.00 mmol) in water (10 mL) was added to a stirring
solution of 5-amino-1-pentene23 (170 mg,

dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL) and was added slowly to this solution.
The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h before
the organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was washed
