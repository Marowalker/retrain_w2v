Nanocomposite
hydrogels have found a wide scope in regenerative
medicine, tissue engineering, and smart drug delivery applications.
The present study reports the formulations of biocompatible nanocomposite
hydrogel films using carboxymethyl cellulose-hydroxyethyl cellulose-acrylonitrile-linseed
oil polyol (CHAP) plain hydrogel and Na-montmorillonite (NaMMT) dispersed
CHAP nanocomposite hydrogel films (NaCHAP) using solution blending
technique. The structural, morphological, and mechanical properties
of resultant nanocomposite hydrogel films were further investigated
to analyze the effects of polyol and NaMMT on the characteristic properties.
The synergistic effect of polyol and nanofillers on the mechanical
strength and sustained drug-release behavior of the resultant hydrogel
films was studied, which revealed that the increased cross-link density
of hydrogels enhanced the elastic modulus (up to 99%) and improved
the drug retention time (up to 72 h at both pHs 7.4 and 4.0). The
release rate of cisplatin in nanocomposite hydrogel films was found
to be higher in CHAP-1 (83 and 69%) and CHAP-3 (79 and 64%) than NaCHAP-3
(77 and 57%) and NaCHAP-4 (73 and 54%) at both pHs 4.0 and 7.4, respectively.
These data confirmed that the release rate of cisplatin in nanocomposite
hydrogel films was pH-responsive and increased with decrease of pH.
All nanocomposite hydrogel films have exhibited excellent pH sensitivity
under buffer solution of various pHs (1.0, 4.0, 7.4, and 9.0). The
in vitro biocompatibility and cytotoxicity tests of these films were
also conducted using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide) assay of human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) and human breast
cancer (MCF-7) cell lines up to 48 h, which shows their biocompatible
nature. However, cisplatin-loaded nanocomposite hydrogel films effectively
inhibited the growth of human breast MCF-7 cancer cells. These studies
suggested that the proposed nanocomposite hydrogel films have shown
promising application in therapeutics, especially for anticancer-targeted
drug delivery.

Introduction
Cancer is a life-alarming
disease responsible for an alarming rate
of death worldwide. The regular treatment of cancer includes surgical
procedure, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.1 Chemotherapy is the utmost effective remedy for introducing the
anticancer drugs into the patient at targeted point to eliminate the
malignant cells.1 Among the abundant anticancer
drugs, cisplatin (cisdiammine dichloroplatinum(II)) is the first-generation
platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug, which is beneficial for the
cure of gastrointestinal, head, neck, ovarian, breast, genitourinary,
and lung cancers.2 However, the use of
cisplatin in cancer therapy is still limited because of its nonspecific
biodistribution and severe side effects, including neurotoxicity,
ototoxicity, myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting.3 In this regard, several attempts have been made to develop
more efficient drug carriers such as polymeric micelles, dendrimers,
liposomes, lipoprotein-based biodegradable nanoparticles, and hydrogels.4 Among these, hydrogels have emerged as the smart
vectors and a promising alternative. These smart systems release the
drug at the site of application in a sustained manner, due to their
stimuli (temperature, pH, electric field)-responsive behavior.

Cellulose is one of the most important biodegradable polymers easily
available in the market, and it could be considered as a possible
candidate for fabricating hydrogels. Cellulose has been widely used
in the textile, paper, and agriculture and food industries besides
being used in specific-purpose biomaterials, such as hemodialysis
devices, wound dressing, tissue engineering, and drug delivery due
to its biocompatible, biodegradable, and nontoxic nature.5−7 However, due to its insolubility in water for fabrication of hydrogel,
there is a large interest toward its derivatives. Various cellulose
byproducts are derived from cellulose via chemical reactions, such
as cellulose acetate, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl
cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), methylcellulose, and cyanoethyl
cellulose. Among the various derivatives, HEC and CMC had been produced
extensively and are water-soluble biomaterials.8 However, CMC cannot be used as it tends to form intramolecular
rather than intermolecular cross-links. For this reason, CMC, in its
sodium salt form (NaCMC), has been used along with HEC, whose introduction
avoids the formation of intramolecular cross-links because of the
presence of polar functional (−OH) groups that enhances their
in vivo degradation.9 HEC exhibits stability,
suspension, dispersing ability, etc. The hydrogel films fabricated
from CMC and HEC have many inherent advantages such as good film-forming
capacity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and natural abundance.
Therefore, these hydrogels can be used to deliver a number of therapeutics
(proteins, vaccines, enzymes, drugs).10 However, CMC- and HEC-based hydrogels are associated with poor mechanical
properties, extensive swelling, rapid rupture, and fast in vitro biodegradability,
which minimize their efficiency during the course of application.
Hence, several methodologies have been established to improve and
strengthen their inter/intramolecular interactions via increasing
their cross-link density within the hydrogel structure through physical
blending, interpenetrating networks, and the incorporation of different
nanofillers.11,12 The utilization of nanofillers
led to the development of highly stable nanocomposite hydrogels. Among
various nanofillers, Na-montmorillonite (NaMMT), a smective-type clay,
is composed of an expandable 2:1 type of alumino silicate clay mineral,
which has a layered structure and also a relatively high cation exchange
capacity, large specific surface area, good swelling capacity, and
high platelet aspect ratio.13 The literature
reveals that the use of low-cost nanoclay in the hydrogel matrix induces
higher mechanical, thermal, hydrophilic, and organophilic properties
in resultant nanocomposites. In addition, NaMMT is a versatile material
for the preparation nanocomposite hydrogels for new drug-delivery
systems, to promote the effective loading of drugs and their release
rate reveals that the use of low-cost nanoclay in the hydrogel matrix
induces higher mechanical, thermal, hydrophilic, and organophilic
properties in resultant nanocomposites.14−16 For instance, Wang et
al. reported quaternized chitosan/montmorillonite-based composites
with enhanced drug encapsulation efficiency and decreased the drug
release rate.17 Iliescu et al. prepared
nanocomposite beads based on montmorillonite and sodium alginate as
drug carriers.18 The literature further
reveals that the delivery of cisplatin through various hydrogels exhibits
short retention time.15−17 Thus, there is a need to develop hydrogels that can
induce higher retention time for the delivery of cisplatin. In view
of this, we have developed Na-montmorillonite-dispersed nanocomposite
hydrogels to investigate the delivery of cisplatin and its retention
time.

Considering the synergistic contribution of natural polymers
and
NaMMT in the development of biomaterials, our hypothesis in the present
study was to disperse the NaMMT into the HEC. The CMC matrix shows
controlled water uptake capacity and drug release rate, through illuminating
the drug release time of the nanocomposite hydrogel films. To validate
this hypothesis, we report a facile method to fabricate a novel nanocomposite
hydrogel film using HEC, CMC, acrylonitrile (AN), sustainable polyols
(cross-linking agents), and NaMMT (nanofillers) via solution blending
technique for controlled release of cisplatin. The effect of concentration
of 3 and 6 mg of NaMMT on the assembly, morphology, mechanical and
swelling properties, biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and drug release
profile of these films was investigated by Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
tensile strength techniques, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assays of normal human embryonic kidney
(HEK-293) and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines, and UV–vis
spectrometry. Cisplatin can be taken as a model drug to prove that
these nanocomposite hydrogel films are applicable for targeting chemotherapy.
The prolonged and sustained release rate of cisplatin from the nanocomposite
hydrogel films in the present study is found to be higher than that
of others hydrogels for cisplatin delivery,3,19−22 which can be attributed to the selection of sustainable (biodegradable,
biocompatible) polymers and Na-montmorillonite dispersion that showed
efficiently drug delivery.

Results
Synthesis and Formulation
of CMC-HEC-AN-LP (CHAP) and NaCHAP
Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
The facile strategy is via solution
blending for the preparation and formulation of plain and nanocomposite
hydrogel films, using biodegradable and biocompatible CMC-HEC-AN,
linseed oil polyol (LP), and NaMMT as matrix, cross-linker, and nanofillers,
respectively, as per reaction scheme (Scheme 1). The interactions between different polar
functionalities of CMC, HEC-AN, and polyol led to the formation of
a stable CHAP hydrogel network. The processed hydrogel was further
stabilized through the dispersion of NaMMT nanofillers in CHAP matrix
solution (Scheme 1),
resulting in the formation of NaCHAP nanocomposites. The solutions
of these hydrogels were cast in Petri plates and placed in an vacuum
oven at 27 °C for 4–5 days to obtain their respective
films of around ∼75 μm thickness. The tensile strength
test on these films was conducted on universal testing of machine,
which shows that the nanocomposite hydrogel films have superior mechanical
strength (Figure 3).
These films (plain and nanocomposite hydrogels) were used for further
studies.

FT-IR Spectroscopy of CHAP
and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Films
The FT-IR spectra (Figure 1a) of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, and NaCHAP-3 confirm
the successful formation of plain and nanocomposite hydrogels. The
absorption peaks at 1544 and 1404 cm–1 are assigned
to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of COO– groups,
while the peak at 1376 cm–1 is attributed to −OH
bending vibration.23 The peak at 1745 cm–1 in CHAP-3 and NaCHAP-3 is attributed to the stretching
of C=O bond, which confirms the formation of ester linkage
and signifies the cross-linking between polymer matrix and polyol.24 The absence of this peak (1745 cm–1) in CHAP-1 reveals the lack of cross-linking within the hydrogel
structure.24 The absorption band with multiple
peaks in the range of 1121–1017 cm–1 is attributed
to the formation of ether bonds in CMC backbone.25 The band at 2928 cm–1 is due to C–H
stretching vibration. The shifting of −OH bands (CHAP-1) from
3268 to 3260 cm–1 (CHAP-3) and 3254 cm–1 (NaCHAP-3) is due to the presence of electrostatic interactions
between the −OH groups of NaMMT and those of CMC, HEC, and
polyol.26 In addition, the two vibrational
peaks at 3314 and 3268 cm–1 in the case of CHAP-1
merged after the incorporation polyol and NaMMT into the CHAP matrix
and appeared at 3254 cm–1 of −OH groups,
which indicate the occurrence of chemical interaction between −OH
groups of polyol and NaMMT. These results suggest the formation of
hydrogen bonding between CHAP hydrogel and NaMMT, resulting in the
formation of nanocomposite (NaCHAP) hydrogels. The additional absorption
peaks at 2111 and 2100 cm–1 (C≡N group) were
pragmatic in NaCHAP-3, CHAP-3, and CHAP-1, indicating superficial
AN grafting on CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel films.27

patterns

XRD Analysis of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
Figure 1b represents
the XRD patterns of CMC, CHAP-3, and NaCHAP-3 nanocomposite hydrogel
films. XRD patterns were recorded in the range of 5–60°
(2θ). CMC exhibits a broad peak at about 20.2°, which indicates
that the CMC possesses an amorphous structure.28 However, the diffraction patterns of CHAP-3 and NaCHAP-3
show the presence of a prominent peak at 25.2°, which exhibits
a positive blue shift of 5.2°, i.e., from 20.2 to 25.2°,
can be corroborated to the incorporation of HEC and polyol within
the amorphous structure of CMC, resulting in the formation of amorphous
structure of CHAP-3 and NaCHAP-3. In addition, the presence of additional
sharp peaks at 17, 28, and 33° in CHAP-3 and NaCHAP-3 indicates
grafting of acrylonitrile into CHAP-based polymer matrix.27 However, the NaCHAP-3 exhibits a decrease in
the intensity of the sharpness of the peak at 25.2° after the
dispersion of NaMMT within the polymer matrix, which indicates the
presence of strong interaction between the −OH groups of NaMMT
and those of CHAP hydrogels.17 The X-ray
diffractogram of NaCHAP-3 (nanocomposite) corresponds to a full width
at half-maximum of 0.145, having an average particle size of 63 nm,
calculated by Scherrer equation. The particle size of around 60–70
nm calculated with XRD is in good agreement with transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis.

SEM of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Films
The internal morphologies of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, and NaCHAP-3
films were
recorded on SEM at two different magnifications, as shown in Figure 2. The surface morphology
of CHAP-1 (Figure 2a,a″) exhibits a relatively smooth and continuous structure,
whereas the surface of CHAP-3 shows pores and a highly cross-linked
structure (Figure 2b,b″). This can be attributed to the presence of a considerable
amount of polyol (10 mL) on the surface of CMC/HEC, which resulted
in the formation of a cross-link structure of polymer matrix with
increased mechanical strength.29 On the
other hand, the surface morphology of NaCHAP-3 (Figure 2c,c″) shows a homogeneous distribution
of NaMMT, implying good interaction between NaMMT and CMC/HEC/AN/PO,
which is ascribed to the good compatibility achieved through the physical,
chemical, and hydrogen bondings between CMC, HEC, AN-PO, and NaMMT.

and 500× (a and a″); CHAP-3 at 500× and 1000×
(b and b″); and NaCHAP-3 at 20 000× and 5000×
magnification (c and c″).

TEM of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
The
size and distribution pattern of NaMMT nanoparticles within the
polymer matrix were studied at different magnifications using TEM.
The transmission electron micrographs of NaCHAP-3 (Figure S1) reveal that the nanoparticles of NaMMT are well
dispersed within the polymer (CHAP) matrix and show spherical globular
morphology of relatively uniform size in accordance with the particle
size as estimated in the previous XRD section by the Scherrer equation
(60–70 nm). The brighter region represents polymer matrix,
while the dark spots are of NaMMT nanoparticles. The dispersion of
dark-phase nanoparticles embedded within the bright polymer (CMC/HEC/AN/PO)
reveals the grafting of polymer matrix on the surface of exfoliating
NaMMT nanoparticles through hydrogen bonding besides the other strong
electrostatic interactions between the functionalities of filler and
matrix of nanocomposite hydrogels.30 This
suggests that the exfoliated NaMMT nanoparticles act as a physical
cross-linker,17 which enhances the stability
and tensile strength of nanocomposite hydrogels.

Tensile Strength
of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
The mechanical
properties of CHAP NaCHAP hydrogel films were studied
in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus. These tests were
performed on CHAP and NaCHAP films at room temperature (25 °C).
The stress–strain curves (Figure 3a) of these films
confirmed that the nanocomposite hydrogel films exhibit significantly
superior mechanical properties compared to the CHAP hydrogel film.
These curves (Figure 3a) show that the robustness of nanocomposite hydrogel films increases
with increased loading of NaMMT (3 and 6 mg). The tensile strength
tests show an increasing trend, viz., 22.27, 22.96, 24.86, and 26.42
MPa, respectively, for CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4 films,
while the % tensile stresses of the CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4
films were found to be 8.88, 23.59, and 48.43%, respectively, higher
than CHAP-1. The increase in tensile strength and % tensile-stress-bearing
ability of nanacomposite hydrogel films can be attributed to the higher
intermolecular interactions of nanofillers and polymer matrix as well
as chain entanglement of the polyol with those of CMC/HEC molecules.
On the other hand, the incorporation of NaMMT further improved the
intermolecular interactions, consequently resulting in the increase
of % tensile strength of nanocomposite films, i.e., NaCHAP-3 (23.59%)
and NaCHAP-4 (48.43%) as compared to CHAP-3 (8.88%).31 The stress–strain curves for nanocomposite (NaCHAP-3
and NaCHAP-4) hydrogel films are linear in nature, while those of
plain hydrogel (CHAP-1 and CHAP-3) films are parabolic in nature.

curves of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4
(a). Tensile stress and elastic modulus of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3,
and NaCHAP-4 (b). The error bars in the graph represent standard deviations
(n = 5).

In addition, the elastic moduli of these films were determined
using the slopes of the linear region of the stress–strain
curves (Figure 3b),
recorded in increasing order (3.63, 4.07, 5.01, and 6.34 GPa, for
CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4 respectively) of these films,
and similar linear increase in % elastic modulus of these films was
observed, i.e., 17, 45, and 99%, compared to CHAP-1. These results
are in good agreement with those of % tensile strength. These investigations
confirmed that the nanocomposite hydrogel films present superior mechanical
properties to plain hydrogel films, which can be ascribed to the strong
electrostatic/physical interactions of fillers (NaMMT) with polymer
matrix (CHAP) through their polar functionalities.

Swelling Ratios
of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
Swelling
capacity of hydrogels is one of the important characteristics
that reveals their ability to retain and absorb solvents containing
fertilizers, reagents, and drugs along with an ability for their controlled
release, which make them potential candidates for application in the
field of drug delivery.32 Thus, the swelling
behaviors of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4 hydrogel films
were investigated using phosphate buffer solutions of pHs 1.0, 4.0,
7.4, and 9.0 at room temperature (25 °C) (Figure 4a–c). These films show higher swelling
ratios at pHs 7.4 and 9.0 without affecting stability, while in acidic
medium (pHs 1.0 and 4.0), they exhibit a lower swelling ratio. The
swelling ratios of hydrogel films increase on moving from acidic to
slightly alkaline pH (Figure 4a). This change in pH sensitivity
of the CHAP and NaCHAP films can be attributed to the hydrophilicity
of the −OH groups in the hydrogels network. At low pH (pHs
1.0 and 4.0), most of the carboxylate anions were protonated, eliminating
the anion–anion repulsion, leading to a remarkable decrease
in swelling ratio24 (Figure 4a), while at higher pH (pHs 7.4 and 9.0),
some of the carboxylate groups were ionized, causing electrostatic
anion–anion repulsion, which leads to the improvement in the
swelling ratios of these hydrogel films.24

Figure 4 Swelling
ratios of CHAP and NaCHAP at pHs 1.0, 4.0, 7.4, and 9.0
(a). Swelling ratios of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4 at
pHs 4.0 and 7.4 (b, c). The error bars in the graph represent standard
deviations (n = 3).

Among all of these hydrogel films, the CHAP-1 film exhibits
the
highest swelling ratio at pHs 4.0 and 7.4, i.e., 58.99 and 33.99%
(CHAP-1) > 46.66 and 27.00% (CHAP-3) > 42.59 and 24.55% (NaCHAP-3)
> 38.07 and 21.34% (NaCHAP-4) respectively (Figure 4b,c). The augmentation in the swelling behavior
of CHAP-1 can be attributed to the presence of free −OH groups
of CMC and HEC, which interact with water molecules, making the hydrogel
more hydrophilic, which helps in imbibing the large amount of water.33 However, the reduction in the swelling ability
of CHAP-3 can be due to the generation of more cross-linking points
through the introduction of polyol segments within the hydrogel networks.
This led to the formation of a rigid and highly cross-linked structure,
reducing the available free space within the hydrogel.34 However, in the case of nanocomposite hydrogels
(NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4), the presence of NaMMT further increases the
cross-linked structure and reduces the spaces of microchannels and
pores of hydrogels, resulting in the decrease of swelling ratio compared
to plain hydrogels.31 However, the mechanical
stability of nanocomposite hydrogels increases and attained the optimum
swelling ratio.

Equilibrium Water Swelling Studies of CHAP
and NaCHAP Nanocomposite
Hydrogel Films
The equilibrium swelling behaviors (%EWS)
of CHAP and NaCHAP hydrogel films was studied at pHs 4.0, 7.4, and
9.0 and room temperature (25 °C). It was noted that CHAP-1 has
higher values of %EWS than CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4 hydrogels
(Table S2). In the case of CHAP-3, the
reduction in %EWS may be due to the loss of hydrophilicity of the
hydrogel induced by the addition of polyol, which acts as a cross-linker.
On the other hand, the NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4 nanocomposite hydrogels
exhibit a decrease in %EWS. The presence of NaMMT in nanocomposite
hydrogels led to the formation of more cross-linked structure that
reduces the free space of pores and microchannels, which led to decrease
in %EWS and further increase of the loading of NaMMT in nanocomposite
hydrogels.31

Degradability Study
Hydrolytic
Degradation of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Films
The biodegradability of CHAP and NaCHAP hydrogels films
strongly influences the release of drug into their target side without
inducing any toxicity.35 Thus, the hydrolytic
degradation of these hydrogel (CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4)
films was investigated at pH 7.4 (Figure S2a), which involves the hydrolysis of the functional groups enhancing
the possibility for the formation of labile bonds.34 The hydrolytic degradability studies revealed that initially
the hydrogel films showed a rapid increase in weight through swelling,
followed by a weight loss due to the deswelling and degradation of
hydrogel films. It was observed that there was successive weight loss
after attaining %EWS. The degradability test confirmed that initially
the mass loss started in the CHAP-1 films, followed by CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3,
and NaCHAP-4. The decrease in weight of these films was recorded at
a regular interval of time for a period of 28 days, which confirms
the degradation process of these films. The presence of hydrophilic
groups in CHAP-1 led to the improvement in the water uptake ability
of the film, which enhances the autocatalytic degradation.25 However, the higher hydrolytic degradability
stability of CHAP-3 than CHAP-1 is due to the presence of polyol,
which improves the cross-linked structure of hydrogels. The NaCHAP-3
and NaCHAP-4 films presented higher strength in the solution of pH
7.4, which start to decompose only after 72 h. The improvement in
the degradation stability of nanocomposite hydrogels can be confirmed
by the formation of strong electrostatic interactions between polar
functional groups like −OH, −COO, etc., of CMC/HEC and
polyol with those of Na-montmorillonite.

Soil Burial Degradation
of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Films
A soil burial study was conducted on CHAP and NaCHAP
nanocomposite hydrogel films for 42 days in beakers containing 30%
moist soil. The humidity of the soil can be maintained by adding water
on every second day to overcome the loss of water occurring through
evaporation.25 The CHAP and NaCHAP films
of 1 cm × 1 cm dimensions were charged in various soil-containing
beakers. The mass loss in films after immersing in soil was studied
by weighing the samples on a Sartorius analytical balance (with accuracy
of ±0.0002) before and after degradation at a given time interval
(i.e., 1, 2, 3, 7, 14,..., 42 days) (Figure S2b). The weight loss occurred primarily in the case of CHAP-1 and CHAP-3
films after 72 h, while the NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4 films showed degradation
only after 144 h, much slower than the degradation of plain hydrogel
films. This can be due to the presence of Na-montmorillonite nanofillers,
which induces the cross-linked network of NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4 nanocomposite
films that restricts the movement of polymer chains and leads to reduced
degradation rate compared to CHAP-1 and CHAP-3 films. The initial
weight loss and insignificant mechanical strength in CHAP-1 and CHAP-3
are also evident from storage and loss modulus compared to those of
NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4 films (Figure 3). The increased water absorption capability of CHAP-1
helps to induce a more flexible structure of plain hydrogel films
containing CMC/HEC, which might enhance the phenomenon of autocatalytic
degradation.25

In Vitro Cell Assay of
CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Films
The MTT assay studies of (%) cell viability have indicated
that the CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel films do not cause
any numerical deterioration in cell viability up to 48 h treatment
(Figure 5a). Different
concentrations of the resultant hydrogel films were used to investigate
the toxicity on human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, and it was
observed that these hydrogel films have biocompatible properties.
In the case of CHAP-1 and CHAP-3, there is only 15 and 9% cytotoxicity
(i.e., ≥ 85 and 92% cell viability) compared to that of control
(100% cell viability) at 100 μg/mL after 48 h incubation. However,
the (%) cell viability decreases with increased concentration, i.e.,
at 200 μg/mL, and shows marginal toxicity (28–22%) with
72–77% cell viability. The NaMMT-modified nanocomposite hydrogel
films (NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4) have ≥81.44 and 73.33% cell viabilities
at 200 μg/mL, which demonstrated that the (%) cell viability
of the nanocomposite hydrogel films increased after the dispersion
of NaMMT in CMC-HEC-AN-polyol polymer matrix.36 From the graph (Figure 5a), it has been confirmed that these hydrogels did not show
any significant toxicity even at higher doses (200 μg/mL). In
addition, the morphology of the cell with CHAP and NaCHAP (CMC-HEC-AN-polyol
biopolymer-modified NaMMT) disks treatment was studied using an inverted
microscope system, which scanned the entire probes. The study on cellular
morphology shows no alteration in the original morphology of cells
used in the case of hydrogels in comparison to that of control cells
even at the highest dose of treatment (i.e., 200 μg/mL) after
48 h, suggesting that the interaction of both CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite
hydrogel films with HEK-293 cells did not have negative effect on
cell life and morphology (Figure 5b). The MTT assays indicate that these hydrogels are
found to be biocompatible at these tested concentrations (i.e., 25–200
μg/mL). The inspiring biocompatibilities of CHAP and NaCHAP
suggested that the resultant nanocomposite hydrogel films can be successfully
applied for drug-delivery systems.

Drug Loading of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
Cisplatin was selected as a model drug to assess both drug loading
and controlled release behavior of nanocomposite hydrogel films. The
method used for drug loading onto the hydrogel films has been described
in the previous characterization section. In all of the cases (CHAP-1,
CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4), the hydrogel films were dispersed
in drug solution of known concentration for 72 h. The transparent
hydrogel films in the swollen states in pH 4.0 and 7.4 drug appeared
yellow with a more tightly compact form upon complexation with cisplatin.
The loading of cisplatin drug in CHAP-1 hydrogel showed a higher %
(17 and 30.03%) loading compared to CHAP-3 (14 and 27.27%), NaCHAP-3
(10.71 and 23.42%), and NaCHAP-4 (7.14 and 21.44%) after 72 h at both
pHs 4.0 and 7.4, which can be attributed to the higher swelling behavior
and interactions of drug molecules with the polar functional groups
of constituent moieties of CHAP-1 and CHAP-3, whereas the loading
of cisplatin was found to be comparatively slightly lower in the case
of NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4 at both pHs (4.0 and 7.4). The slightly lower
loading of cisplatin drug in nanocomposite hydrogels is due to the
random distribution of NaMMT nanofillers into the CHAP polymeric matrix,
which resulted in the formation of highly cross-linked structures,
thereby reducing the free space within the polymer matrix, which led
to the reduction of the penetration of drug molecules. Furthermore,
these hydrogel films showed higher drug loading at pH 7.4 than at
pH 4.0, due to higher degree of swelling at pH 7.4.

Drug Release
of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
The in vitro
cisplatin release profile was investigated by dispersing
the cisplatin drug-loaded CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4 hydrogel
films in the phosphate buffer solutions of pHs 4.0 and 7.4 for a defined
period of time (Figure 6a,b). From the graph, it has been observed that in vitro the release
showed a biphasic pattern; the initial release was attributed to the
burst release, which disappears within a limited hours; the continuing
elongated pattern showed a linear sustained release. The drug release
data demonstrated that these nanocomposite hydrogels films act as
an optimal device for a sustained release of anticancer drug. The
sustained release phase could have been due to the cross-linked porous
and polar structure of hydrogel, achieved via dispersion of NaMMT
nanofillers and polyol, a cross-linker into the polymer matrix, which
reduces the diffusion process for the drug entrapped within the inner
part of hydrogels and act as a drug reservoir for cancer treatment.
It is observed from Figure 6a,b that the amount of drug release was found to be much higher
(CHAP-1 (83%) > CHAP-3 (79%) > NaCHAP-3 (77%) > NaCHAP-4
(73%)) at
pH 7.4 than at pH 4.0 (CHAP-1 (69%) > CHAP-3 (64%) > NaCHAP-3
(57%)
> NaCHAP-4 (54%)), which lasted less than 72 h, exhibiting a pH-dependent
behavior.

Figure 6 Drug release kinetics of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4
nanocomposite hydrogel films at pH 7.4 (a) and pH 4.0 (b). The error
bars in the graph represent standard deviations (n = 4).

Initially, during the first 2
h, the burst release of drug from
CHAP-1 (38 and 24%) and CHAP-3 (20 and 22%) film at pHs 7.4 and 4.0,
respectively, was approximately observed. The subsequent increase
in the drug releasing rate at pH 7.4 can be attributed to the poor
electrostatic interaction between the drug molecules and hydrogels
at high pH.33 The decrease in the release
behavior of cisplatin at pH 4.0 was consistent with the results from
the swelling studies at low-pH solutions. In addition, the higher
drug release rates of CHAP-1 and CHAP-3 films compared to those of
NaCHAP-3 and NaCHAP-4 at both pHs 4.0 and 7.4 can be assigned to the
higher swelling ability due to more porous and flexible structure,
which led for the faster and higher release rate of the drug. Due
to the porous structure of this film, cisplatin is more weakly complexed
to the carboxylate group of CMC/HEC, whereas in the case of NaCHAP-3
and NaCHAP-4, after the burst phase in the first few hours, the release
of cisplatin exhibited a tendency to decrease with the increase of
the NaMMT content in the hydrogel composition.31 The sustained release rate can be attributed to the intermolecular
interaction formed by the dispersion of Na-montmorillonite nanoparticles
within the polymer matrix. In the present study, it was found that
the release rate of cisplatin loaded in (CHAP) hydrogel and Na-montmorillonite-based
nanocomposite hydrogel films (NaCHAP) was sustained at pHs 4.0 and
7.4. Although other workers have reported the delivery of cisplatin
through hydrogel, the retention time for the same is not sufficiently
high (only 15, 18, and 24 h, Table S3)
compared to the present nanocomposite hydrogels, which found a reasonably
high retention time (72 h). The prolonged sustained and higher efficient
release rates of cisplatin from nanocomposite hydrogels in the present
study were found to be higher than those of the previously reported
system (Table S3), which can be attributed
to the selection of sustainable (biodegradable, biocompatible) polymers
and Na-montmorillonite dispersion that showed high efficiency in drug-delivery
systems.

In Vitro Antiproliferative Efficacies of CHAP and NaCHAP Nanocomposite
Hydrogels
MTT assay on breast cancer (MCF-7) cells after
treatment indicated that CHAP and NaCHAP hydrogels did not induce
significant antiproliferative effect in the dose range of 10–160
μg/mL (Figure 5c). Different concentrations (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 160 μg/mL)
of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4 hydrogel films were used
to investigate the antiproliferative effect on human breast cancer
(MCF-7) cells, and no significant difference in cell viability after
the addition of disks compared to control was observed (Figure 5c). Although CHAP-1 and CHAP-3
were found to be slightly cytotoxic (i.e., 30 and 37%) at higher concentration
(160 μg/mL), which is maximum cytotoxicity compared to all of
the studied hydrogels. In our study, we have found that the cell viability
is approximately ≥70% at 160 μg/mL, which was relatively
high, indicating that the resultant hydrogel films had no significant
growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells without cisplatin.

In Vitro Antiproliferative
Efficacies of Cisplatin-Loaded CHAP
and NaCHAP Nanocomposite Hydrogels
The anticancer activities
of free cisplatin and cisplatin-loaded CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite
hydrogel films against MCF-7 cells were examined through MTT assay.
The MTT assay on MCF-7 cells after treatment indicated that cisplatin-loaded
CHAP and NaCHAP hydrogel samples show significant antiproliferative
effect in the dose range of 50–200 μg/mL (Figure 5d). The biocompatibilities
of CHAP and NaCHAP were first examined before the incorporation of
cisplatin. The CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogels were found
to be nontoxic (200 μg/mL), which indicate high biocompatibility,
and did not affect the results of the cell viability in the cisplatin
carriers. To evaluate the antiproliferative effect of free cisplatin
and cisplatin-loaded CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel films,
we fixed the concentration of cisplatin at 0.75 mg/mL. Different concentrations
(50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL) of CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and
NaCHAP-4 hydrogel films were used to investigate the antiproliferative
effect on breast cancer (MCF-7) cells up to 48 h (Figure 5d). The nanocomposite hydrogels
CHAP-1 (54%), CHAP-3 (57%), NaCHAP-3 (59%), and NaCHAP-4 (63%) showed
a slow decline of cancer cells (half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) 139.14, 169.52, 159, and 176 μg/mL), respectively),
after being incubated for 48 h. In contrast, cisplatin (Figure S4) shows anticancer activity at lower
doses (IC50 123.24 μg/mL) that killed 56% cancer
cells (44% cell viability) and left only 18% of the cell viability
at high concentration (IC50 176 μg/mL). Overall,
the cytotoxic effects of the treated hydrogels (CHAP and NaCHAP) were
lesser than those of the cisplatin-free drug. This can be due to the
fact that the nanocomposite hydrogels exhibit lower antiproliferative
activity compared to free cisplatin, which can be attributed to the
sluggish internalization of the polysaccharide-based hydrogels into
the cell and the slow release pattern of cisplatin,37 while the higher cytotoxicity of the cisplatin-free drug
can be attributed to the fast release of cisplatin due to the unmodified
drug carrier.37 The results after 48 h
of incubation suggest that the CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogels
provided an increased growth inhibition of human breast cancer cells,
indicating a sustained release of cisplatin with time.

Conclusions
The CHAP and Na-montmorillonite-dispersed sustainable polymer nanocomposite
hydrogel (NaCHAP) films were synthesized using CMC-HEC-AN-LP via solution
blending techniques. The study revealed that the unique characteristic
properties are associated with the introduction of NaMMT in the CHAP
matrix, which resulted in the enhanced stability of nanocomposite
hydrogels inducing restricted hydrophilicity in swelling ratio measurement
and tensile strength. The in vitro cytotoxicity test of CHAP plain
hydrogel and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogels indicated that they are
highly biocompatible and nontoxic, which is suitable to be used in
drug-delivery systems. The release rate of cisplatin in nanocomposite
hydrogels was found to be higher in CHAP-1 (83 and 69%) and CHAP-3
(79 and 64%) than in NaCHAP-3 (77 and 57%) and NaCHAP-4 (73 and 54%)
at pHs 4.0 and 7.4, respectively. The in vitro cytotoxicity of cisplatin-loaded
nanocomposite hydrogels test indicates that these films effectively
inhibited the growth of human breast MCF-7 cancer cell line. These
results suggested that in future, CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel
films find promising platforms to construct pH-responsive controlled
anticancer (in vivo, in the form of capsules) drug-delivery systems.

Synthesis of CMC-HEC-AN-Polyol
(CHAP) and CMC-HEC-AN-Polyol-NaMMT
(NaCHAP) Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
The CHAP and NaCHAP
nanocomposite hydrogel films were primed via a simple solution blending
technique.27 CMC (2%) and HEC aqueous solutions
(2%) (20 mL each) were charged in a 200 mL beaker, followed by the
addition of 5 mL of acrylonitrile (AN), different concentrations of
1% linseed oil polyol (Table S1) as cross-linking
agent, and different amounts (3 and 6 mg) of NaMMT dispersed in CHAP
aqueous solution under sonication for 1 h to confirm the complete
dispersion of NaMMT, followed by 72 h stirring by a magnetic stirrer.
The prepared nanocomposite hydrogels were discharged into a Petri
dish kept at room temperature (25 °C) until the films were obtained.
Plane CHAP hydrogel films were also prepared using a similar method.
CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel thin films (∼75 μm
thickness) were cut into 1 cm × 1 cm dimensions to use them for
further studies.

FT-IR Analysis
The CHAP and NaCHAP
were dried at room
temperature (25 °C) for 48 h to obtain the constant weight. The
chemical structures of these hydrogel films were investigated using
FT-IR spectra recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 using an FT-IR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Cetus Instruments,
Norwalk, CT, Central Instrumentation facility, Jamia Millia Islamia).

SEM and TEM Analysis
The morphologies of dried and
swelled CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel films were investigated
by SEM (environmental scanning electron microscope model FEI Quanta
200 F with Oxford EDS system IE 250 X Max 80). The nanocomposite hydrogel
films were primarily swelled in media of different pHs (4.0 and 7.4)
for 72 h. The interior structure of the swollen films was analyzed
after freeze drying by tumbling in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized
for 24 h to ensure the complete drying and to retain the porous structure
without any split. Prior to their measurement, the freeze-dried samples
were attached to brass holders coated with a thin film of gold for
120 s in a chemical vapor deposition machine. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the size and shape of NaMMT-dispersed
nanocomposite hydrogels (NaCHAP). The images of NaCHAP polymer solutions
were obtained by a transmission electron microscope (a model Philips
Morgagni, 268) operating at 80 kV (AIIMS, New Delhi, India). The crushed
and powdered films were dispersed in distilled water. The dilute suspensions
of these films were initially sonicated for 30–60 min under
ice–water bath for sonication; therefore, numerous droplets
of sonicated suspension were deposited onto a standard carbon-coated
copper grid. The grid was then stained with uranyl acetate solution
(2 wt %) for 30 s overnight for air drying in a vacuum oven at 25
°C. The grid was then placed in the TEM hole for image acquisition.

Mechanical Strength and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Studies
The tensile strength analysis of CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel
films was investigated at room temperature (25 °C) using break
stress and strain tests conducted on the films of 25 mm gauge at a
crosshead speed of 5 mm/min, by Instron universal machine (model no.
8871). These tests were repeated three times on both CHAP and NaCHAP
films, and the average values were recorded. X-ray diffraction of
these samples was conducted on a Siemens X-ray diffractometer model
D5000 equipped with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (k = 1.5406) within the angle range 2θ = 5–60°. The
diffractometer was functioned with 1° diverging, receiving slits
at 50 kW and 40 mA, and a continuous scan was recorded.

Swelling and
Equilibrium Swelling Ratios Measurement
The swelling performances
of CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel
films were measured at 25° for 96 h. These films were taken in
30 mL test tubes containing solutions of pHs 1.0, 4.0, 7.4, and 9.0.
After assigned time intervals (10, 20, 30, 60, 120,..., 5000 min),
the inflamed films were cautiously taken out of these solutions, sponged
with a filter paper (Whatman, 41 number) for removing the additional
water present on the surface, and then weighed again. These films
were again restocked with new solutions in a parallel way. The swelling
ratios of these nanocomposite hydrogel films were calculated using
the equation27 1  where Ws and Wd are the weights of the swollen and dehydrated
CHAP and NaCHAP films, respectively.

The equilibrium water contents
(%EWS) of CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel films were calculated
after 72 h. The % EWS was recorded only after the swollen samples
further swelled and attained equilibrium. The %EWS of the enflamed
sample was calculated using the following equation27 2  where Wwet and Wdry are the weights of swollen and dehydrated
CHAP and NaCHAP films, respectively.

Biodegradability Studies
Hydrolytic
Degradation
The degradability experiments
on CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel films were conducted at
pHs 4.0 and 7.4 and 25 °C. The weight loss of swollen nanocomposite
hydrogel films was frequently studied at specified intervals of times
(i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,..., 28 days) using gravimetric technique.
The average values of three tests were recorded. The degradability
ratio was obtained by the difference of mass loss of CHAP and NaCHAP
films by using the following equation39 3  where We and Wt signify the mass loss of nanocomposite hydrogel
films and their original equilibrium swollen states and at time t at different pH solutions, respectively.

Soil Burial
Test
The soil burial study on CHAP and
NaCHAP films was conducted in temperate soil for 42 days. The soil
used was obtained from Indian Agricultural Institute (PUSA, New Delhi,
India). Beakers were charged with 30% moist soil with slightly acidity
(pH 6.7).6 Different specimens of size
1 cm × 1 cm were charged in separate beakers containing soil,
and the weight loss was carefully measured using a Sartorius analytical
single pan balance (with sensitivity of ±0.0001 g) at different
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5,..., 42 days) time intervals for 42 days.

Cell Culture
In Vitro
Cytotoxicity Assay
The MTT assay is generally
used to validate the biocompatibility/viability/antiproliferative
properties of any biological and synthetic material in vitro.40 Thus, the cytotoxicities of CHAP and NaCHAP
nanocomposite hydrogel films on two different (normal human embryonic
kidney (HEK-293) and human breast cancers (MCF-7) cells) cell lines
were evaluated under in vitro condition. These cells were procured
from National Centre for Cell Sciences (Pune, India). The cell line
with epithelial morphology is commonly used for the determination
of biocompatibility and cytotoxicity study. The cells were cultured
in T-25 and T-75 culture flask in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, HiMedia), which contains 10% fetal bovine serum and
pencillium/streptomycin (HiMedia), at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in humidified chamber (Nuaire CO2 incubator) under MTT
assay. The MTT is a metabolic substrate that reduces in amount by
the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase enzyme that further forms
formazan crystals after association with live cells in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) solution. The OD of the live cells was measured at 570 nm by
a UV spectrophotometer. Further, the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity
of CHAP and NaCHAP were evaluated through MTT assay.

MTT Assay
of Nanocomposite Hydrogel Films
To attain
the MTT assay for the evaluation of biocompatibility and cytotoxicity,
the CHAP and NaCHAP nanocomposite hydrogel films were crushed into
powder by using a sterilized mortar and pestle. The crushed samples
were dispersed in aqueous solutions to prepare the working solutions
of 1 mg/mL concentration. Before its treatment with cells, the aqueous
solution was sonicated at a very high speed for 1 h. The T-75 flask
of cells was harvested using 0.25% trypsin, and the cells were counted
on a Neubauer chamber. A total of 1 × 104 cells/well
were sowed in a flat-bottom 96-well plate (150 μL/well) for
24 h. Both cell (HEK-293 and human breast cancer (MCF-7)) lines after
24 h were treated with hydrogel doses ranging from 50 to 200 and 10
to 160 μg/mL, respectively, for 48 h. After 48 h of treatment,
the medium was isolated and the cells were cultivated with 20 μL/well
of MTT solution for 4 h at 37 °C, resulting in the formation
of Formazan crystals, through mitochondrial reduction of MTT. These
crystals were soothed upon treatment with DMSO solutions of 150 μL/well,
and absorbance was recorded at 570 nm after 15 min of incubation through
the iMark Microplate Reader (BioRad). The %cytotoxicity
and biocompatibility were measured as a fraction of control.

Cisplatin-Loaded
Nanocomposite Hydrogels
The in vitro
loading of cisplatin onto the hydrogels (CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3,
and NaCHAP-4) was carried out at pHs 4.0 and 7.4. The dry nanocomposite
hydrogel films (1 cm × 1 cm) were weighed and soaked in 10 mL
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pHs 4.0 and 7.4) containing cisplatin
drug (6 mM) at a given pH for 72 h. The amount of cisplatin loaded
onto the hydrogel films was measured by UV spectroscopy (a Lambda
950 UV–vis spectrophotometer; PerkinElmer). The complexed hydrogel
films were washed with respective PBS before drying. The maximum loading
of cisplatin was determined after 72 h of treatment, i.e., on turning
the transparent films into light yellow. The supernatant liquid of
the drug solution was analyzed at wavelengths of 301 and 308 nm at
pHs 4.0 and 7.4, respectively. The % drug loading was calculated using
the following equation41 4  

Cisplatin Release from Nanocomposite Hydrogels
The
in vitro release experiments on the cisplatin-loaded plain and nanocomposite
hydrogels (CHAP-1, CHAP-3, NaCHAP-3, and NaCHAP-4) films were carried
out by placing them in 10 mL of PBS (pHs 4.0 and 7.4) in a test tube
for 72 h at room temperature. At certain time intervals (10 min, 30
min, 60 min,..., 72 h), 3 mL of the solution was withdrawn and the
same amount of respective fresh PBS solution was added back to the
beaker to maintain a constant volume. The amount of cisplatin released
was analyzed by measuring the absorbance of the solutions at 301 and
308 nm at pHs 4.0 and 7.4 in a UV–vis spectrophotometer at
the above-mentioned intervals of time. A standard calibration curve
was derived from the absorbance spectra for different concentrations
of standard solutions of cisplatin drug. The drug release studies
were performed in triplicate, and their average value was derived
using the following equation42 5
