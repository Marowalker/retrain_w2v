This work aims to investigate the
electromagnetically induced transparency-like (EIT-like) metamaterial
for high water cut emulsions’ detection in the terahertz band.
The electromagnetic responses of the selected metamaterial covering
emulsions exhibit red-shifted resonant frequency with increasing water
volume from 60 to 98%. Three numerical models coinciding with theory
analysis were built based on the extracted resonant frequencies at
the transmission peak and dips to predict water concentration. The
results show that the built models accurately predicted the water
content with absolute errors less than 0.26, 0.41, and 0.24%, respectively.
The EIT-like resonance is introduced by coupled bright and dark modes,
making it similar to a weakened plasma resonance. Consequently, the
permittivity-dependent frequency would help develop both economically
feasible and socially beneficial sensors for high water content prediction.

1 Introduction
Determining
the water content is significant in evaluating crude oil dehydration,
logging, refining, and exportation.1,2 So far, many
conventional approaches have been employed to determine the water
content of oil–water emulsions in different situations according
to specific needs, such as the microwave technique, the ray, the capacitance,
the Karl Fischer titration method, and near-infrared spectroscopy.3−7 In recent years, requirements for accurate high water content measurement
in oil have been more and more exigent and attracted widespread attention
in theoretical and experimental work. An open measurement method was
proposed to accurately measure water content using a suitable electromagnetic
wave with the right wavelength based on Rayleigh scattering, which
was further proved to be applicable to oil-wells whose water content
is more than 80%.8 An all-optical detection
method based on a noncontact laser source and receiver was introduced
to measure water content from 0 to 100% in crude oil. The theoretical
values of the effective medium model agreed with the experimental
results.9 In addition, terahertz (THz)
spectroscopy, as a new noncontact technique, has been proposed for
predicting subtle changes of water in emulsions owing to the sensitivity
of the THz wave to the fluctuations of water dipole moments occurring
on the picosecond (ps) timescale.10−14 THz time-domain spectroscopy has been used to measure
the water content ranging from 50.05 to 100% in crude oil and to characterize
the distribution of oil, air, and water simultaneously.1 Subsequently, combined with 3D printing technology,
oil–water mixtures with water content from 1.8 to 90.6% were
measured and analyzed with the THz parameters.15 However, THz waves are strongly attenuated by a water layer,
which is a practical limitation in detecting water content for high
water cut emulsions. As a result, to accurately detect high water
cut emulsions in the THz range, a sensing system without suffering
large attenuation effects in the polar liquids is required.

Metamaterials are a new type of artificially fabricated material
with exotic properties such as super lensing, negative refraction,
cloaking, and sensitive sensing.16,17 These properties
are mostly derived
from their ability to support resonance, which is mainly determined
by geometrical parameters. Recently, metamaterials have been employed
as sensitive sensors for chemical and biological detection because
their spectral resonance frequency substantially depends on the dielectric
condition of surrounding media,18−20 which provides a new solution
for us to overcome the limitation mentioned above in oil–water
emulsion measurement by THz spectroscopy. Despite these advances,
they still suffer from low quality factors (Q-factors)
because of the existing radiative losses, which is less than 10 typically.21−23 Thus, their wider utilization in many aspects is limited by the
sensing capabilities and filter performance.

In the past few
years, the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT), as a concept of quantum mechanics, has been introduced to metamaterial
design to overcome the radiative loss problem and become a fascinating
research topic.24,25 EIT is a well-known quantum interference
effect that bases on extraordinary dispersive properties of an atomic
medium in three-level atomic systems. This phenomenon leads to an
extremely narrow band transparency window in the original absorption
spectrum by dramatically changing the dispersion properties of the
system. As EIT stems from coupled resonances, analogous effects can
be realized using classical oscillator systems such as spring-mass
or RLC oscillators (capacitance-inductance-resistance
coupled oscillators). Thus, considerable attention has been paid to
the EIT-like effect in plasmatic metamaterials, whose spectral response
can be explained as being either the result of engaging “trapped
mode” resonances or by the destructive interference between
the so-called bright and dark mode resonances. These metamaterials
can overcome the limitation and realize an EIT-like effect in normal
environment where a significant difference in Q-factors
or full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the two resonance modes is
required in developing the analogy to the EIT effect.26 Recently, research studies on EIT-like metamaterials have
been performed by introducing a graphene layer in the metamaterials
and achieve independent amplitude modulation of the transmission peaks
in the THz regime.27−30

As a consequence, focusing on the high water cut oil–water
emulsion, a method was introduced in this paper to detect the water
content of oil–water emulsions using a THz metamaterial sensor.
To gain the EIT-like effect, a planar symmetric metamaterial sensor
was first designed and simulated without varying the lateral distance
between the resonators. As the sensing performance of the metamaterial
depends strongly on the relative spacing position between the two
modes, the simulated transmission spectra with varying spacing distances
were investigated to choose the optimum parameter for the designed
sensor. It is shown that, because of the coupling strength modulation
of the bright and dark modes, the sensing performance can be significantly
impacted by the altering separation between the two modes. In addition,
analyses of the electromagnetic responses with 5 μm thick oil–water
emulsion overlayers on the selected metamaterial were made to demonstrate
the sensing ability of water concentration. The THz transmission data
illustrate the resonance shifting effects as water concentration increasing
from 60 to 98%, from which the numerical expression used to predict
the water content with high accuracy was then extracted. The results
pave an avenue for THz metamaterials in terms of high water concentration
sensing.

2 Results and Discussion
The sensitivity
(Δf/Δn) and Q-factors of the EIT-like metamaterial sensor, associated
with the coupling degree between the radiative and dark modes, can
be also determined by their spatial separation.34,35 Δf and Δn represent
the shift of resonance frequency and the change of the refractive
index resulted from the covering thin layers, respectively. Here,
the transmission spectra of the designed metamaterial were simulated
by displacing the U-shaped resonators (USRs) gradually from d = 0 to 40 μm as depicted in Figure 1a. It is clear that the coupling strength
between the USR and I-shaped cut-wire (ICW) diminishes with the decreasing d, leading the fading EIT-like response to less transparency.
When the USR moves downward from d = 40 to 10 μm,
the transparency window gradually shrinks without a notable frequency
shift. However, from d = 10 to 0 μm, the transparency
window changes with a notable frequency shift. During the simulating,
the surrounding environmental materials were selected as air (εair = 1) and oil (εoil = 2.33), respectively,
making Δn remain constant and thus sensitivity
is proportional to frequency shifts (Δf) between
the two surroundings. Then, the frequency shifts and the corresponding Q-factors were evaluated to explore the effect of d on the sensing parameters of THz metamaterials. The sensitivity
of the metamaterials becomes higher first and then keeps stable when d increases from 0 to 40 μm. The Q-factors, rather, exhibit a downward tendency with an increase of d. Considering the abovementioned two parameters, metamaterial
with d = 14 μm acted as the sensor to investigate
the responses of oil–water emulsions in the next section.

Figure 1 (a) Simulated
transmission spectra of coupled USR and ICW with different spacing
distances. (b) Frequency shifts with surrounding environments of air
and oil, respectively, and Q-factors vs the distance
between the coupled USR and ICW.

A series of simulated THz transmission spectra of oil–water
emulsions with high water cut for analysis have been shown in Figure 2. As the water content
is gradually raised from 60 to 98%, the simulated EIT resonance is
observed to shift lower in frequency because of the change in the
dielectric configuration of the surrounding area and the amplitude
of the transmission peak is also found to decrease as a result of
changes in the resonant matching conditions.

Figure 2 Simulated transmission
spectra of the designing structure covered by 5 μm thick oil–water
emulsions whose water content varies from 60 to 98%.

The resonant frequency (f) with
the covering emulsions can be calculated by f = f0(εeff/ε0)−1/2 where f0 is the resonant
frequency without the target material while εeff and
ε0 are the effective dielectric constants with and
without the target material in the metamaterial sensor, respectively.
The total effective dielectric constant can be given by εeff = ε1 + Aε + ε3, which is made up of three parts: ε1 is
the dielectric constant due to flux within the substrate, Aε should be due to flux within the overlayer, and
ε3 is the fringing flux in air where A is a scaling constant. Assuming ε1 and ε3 do not change by the addition of the overlayer, then f can be further given as: f = f0((ε1 + Aε
+ ε3)/(ε1 + Aεair + ε3))−1/2.17,36 Thus, the red shift of the EIT peak is due to the increase of the
ambient dielectric constant.

The extracted resonant frequencies f at the transmission peak and dips from the FDTD (Finite-Difference
Time-Domain) simulation results, as well as
the corresponding emulsion water contents α, for the characterized
emulsions are shown in Figure 3a, indicating that the emulsions’ resonant frequencies
can be characterized as functions of water concentration (solid line).
Then, the water concentration of the oil–water mixture can
be deduced from the resonant frequencies of the EIT peak as well as
dips with the following formula  where the corresponding values of a, b, c for the predicting models built by the frequencies
at transmission peak and dips are presented as a table in Figure 3a and all the correlation
coefficients (R) exceeded 99.9%. Moreover, to verify
the predicting accuracy of the model, the transmission spectra were
simulated for emulsions with a water content range of 62–99%,
from which the frequencies of EIT-like resonant peak and dips were
derived. As indicated in Figure 3b, the predicted water concentrations were then calculated
using the models built above and were listed as Table 1.

Meanwhile, the absolute errors of the approach are
presented in Figure 3b as well, where the horizontal axis and the vertical axis represent
the true water content in simulation and the water content predicted
by the EIT-like metamaterial sensor, respectively. Agreement is shown
between the predicting and the standard data with absolute errors
less than 0.26, 0.41, and 0.24% for predicting models at ω1, ω2, and ω3, respectively.
These data illustrate that THz EIT-like metamaterial has a higher
detecting performance on comparing with the ultrasound method whose
detection error is 0.5%.37 The results
demonstrate that the THz EIT-like metamaterial can work as an efficient
sensor for high water concentration measurement of oil–water
emulsions.

In order to understand the predicting models further,
the distribution of induced currents at ω1, ω2, and ω3 are shown in Figure 4a. The ICW element is directly excited by
the external field, whereas the USR is further excited by the near-field
coupling of the ICW. The resonances of USR at ω1 and
ICW at ω3 are caused by the interaction between the
induced currents in the two coupling units. However, at the resonance
ω2, both the USR and ICW are simultaneously excited
because of the resonance detuning and result in the strong EIT-like
effect. The radiation ability of the whole system was weakened because
of the out-of-phase current oscillation, which lead to the sharp transparency
window in the transmission spectra.38

of frequency and dielectric constant for oil–water emulsions

It has been known that the resonant
frequency at the transmission peak and dips, f, is
related to ε by f = f0((ε1 + Aε + ε3)/(ε1 + Aεair + ε3))−1/2. The extracted resonant
frequencies for the transmission peak and dips are shown in Figure 4b as functions of
dielectric constant, which agree with the fitting line. The frequencies
decrease with the augment of dielectric constant, which depends on
the water concentration of the emulsions. The nonlinear relationship
between the dielectric constant and water concentration is shown in Figure 4c and can be written
as the following formulation39  

Accordingly, combining the above equations,
the formulas to predict water concentration of oil–water mixtures
with high accuracy can be obtained as follows      

In brief, our results demonstrate the
feasibility of performing characterization of water content in oil–water
emulsions with high water cut using THz EIT-like metamaterials, overcoming
the current limitations imposed by the strong attenuation of THz waves
by polar liquids.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
because of the unique properties of metamaterials whose resonance
frequencies are sensitive to the changes in permittivity in the surrounding
environment, simulations of 5 μm thick oil–water emulsions
containing 60–98% water were performed using THz metamaterial,
whose Q-factors substantially reduce, whereas sensing
sensitivity amplifies with increasing distance between the bright
and dark modes. A red shift of the EIT-like resonant frequency is
observed with increasing water volume for the 5 μm thick oil–water
emulsion as the sample material. In addition, the resonance frequencies
at the transmission peak and dips are on a downward trend with increasing
water concentration of emulations, which is closely related to the
dielectric constant. The numerical expressions whose predicting absolute
errors are less than 0.26, 0.41, and 0.24% in the actual water content
range of 60–99% have been built about the resonance frequencies
and particular water content at ω1, ω2, and ω3, respectively. The results verify the ability
of this approach to accurately determine the water content of emulsions
for high water cut emulsions without suffering large attenuation effects
in water in the THz regime. Furthermore, the metamaterial could be
potentially coupled with a microfluidic system for in situ sensing
for oil–water two-phase flow.

4 Methods
The THz metamaterial was first designed in this work. The dark
mode is similar to a metastable energy level, which is necessary for
the realization of an EIT medium in an atomic system.31,32 The EIT-like THz metamaterial consisting of a coupled symmetrical
USR and ICW resonator has been proposed and designed as shown in Figure 5b, in which 3 μm
quartz (relative permittivity εquartz = 3.75) and
0.1 μm lossy gold with a conductivity of δgold = 4.56 × 107 s/m were selected as the substrate
and covering material. The geometric parameters a, b, w, m, g, l, and t are 30, 50,
10, 17, 31, 90, and 5 μm, whereas the periodicity in the x and y directions is Px = Py = 100 μm in free space. The spacing of the two coupling
elements is denoted as d (d = 14
here), which will be discussed in the next section. Meanwhile, the
electric wall, magnetic wall, as well as open boundary conditions
in the x, y, and z directions were utilized. During the simulating, the hexahedral
grids with an accuracy of −60 dB in the time domain solver
were applied to create an improved mesh.

Figure 5 (a) Simulated transmission
spectra of the designed EIT-like metamaterial as well as the coupling
units (90-USR, USR, and ICW) and the illustration of a unit cell schematic
is shown in (b). (c–f) show the distribution of induced currents
at resonance frequencies of 90-USR, USR, ICW, and EIT-like, respectively.

The transmission spectra of the
designed EIT-like metamaterial and the coupling unit cells were simulated
by CST Microwave Studio and are shown in Figure 5a. As expected, when a plane wave with its
electric orientation parallel to the y axis normally
irradiates on the metamaterials along the z axis,
the 90° rotating USR (90-USR) and ICW are excited strongly by
incident light and inspire a strong plasmon resonance at 1.098 and
1.118 THz, whereas there is no resonance peak for USR between 0.1
and 1.6 THz. Although the spectral resonant frequencies of 90-USR
and ICW elements are similar, the Q-factors of the
USR are much different from that of ICW, which lays the foundation
of the achieving of EIT-like metamaterial. When the USR substructure
is combined with the ICW structure, it demonstrates two splitting
transmission dips (denoted as ω1 and ω3) as well as a sharp transmission peak (denoted as ω2) in the transmission spectrum and an EIT-like transparency
window with 56.95% transmission appears at 1.132 THz in the transmission
spectrum. The fwhm of the EIT-like resonance peak is 0.034 THz, and
the corresponding quality factor (Q = ω2/fwhm) reaches 33.3.

As depicted in Figure 5c,d, to interpret the discrepant
resonance characteristics, the distribution of the induced surface
currents in the 90-USR and ICW resonator elements was plotted at their
resonant frequencies. The current in the 90-USR structure is circulating
current, while it is the dipole current in the ICW structure. However,
owing to the equal
length of the top and bottom arms of 90-USR, the symmetrical currents
in the two arms cancel each other, making the net dipole moment excited
from the external E-field, which is mainly contributed from the left
arm of 90-USR. Thus, the effect length of the left arm of the 90-USR
element is slightly shorter than that of the ICW one, leading the
90-USR to a thinner fwhm of resonance because the radiation damping
increases with the particle size.33 The
distribution of induced surface currents of USR at 1.098 THz is presented
in Figure 5e where
no circulating currents form. Therefore, there is no direct electrical
dipole coupling with the incident wave, and it can be considered as
a dark mode, whereas the ICW which is excited strongly by propagating
waves could serve as the bright mode. The concomitant circulating
currents and dipole moment in Figure 5f reveal the simultaneous excitation of both USR and
ICW for the designed structure. The LC resonance in the dark mode
is excited by the constructive interference between electrical and
magnetic surface currents whose coupling strength depends on the phase
difference between the magnetic and the electric excited in the ICW.34

The media used in simulations were 5 μm
thick oil–water emulsions whose water content ranged from 60
to 98%. The density and dielectric constant of water are 1000 kg/m3 and 78, respectively, whereas they are 920 kg/m3 and 2.33 for oil.
