A great interest has been shown in
the injectable scaffolds for
cartilage tissue regeneration because it can fill irregularly shaped
defects easily through minimally invasive surgical treatments. Herein,
we developed a new injectable three-dimensional (3D) alginate hydrogel
loaded with biodegradable porous poly(ε-caprolactone)–b-poly(ethylene glycol)–b-poly(ε-caprolactone)
microspheres (MPs/Alg) as the calcium gluconate container to cross-link
alginate. Suspensions of chondrocytes/alginate and porous microspheres
turned into a gel because of the release of calcium gluconate; thus,
the injectable composite hydrogels give a 3D scaffold to fit the defects
perfectly and integrate the extracellular-matrix-mimicking architecture
to efficiently accommodate cartilage cells in situ. Tissue repair
in a full-thickness cartilage defect model was controlled at 6, 12,
and 18 weeks after the implant by micro-CT and immunohistochemistry
to evaluate the healing status. The defect in the MPs/Alg+
cells group achieved an almost complete repair at 18 weeks, and the
repaired chondrocytes regained a normal tissue structure. Moreover,
the MPs/Alg+ cells-treated group increased the quality of tissue formed,
including the accumulated glycosaminoglycan and the uniformly deposited
type II collagen. The results point out the promising application
of the injectable MPs/Alg-chondrocytes system for cartilage tissue
engineering.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
self-repairing ability of articular cartilage after damage is very
limited because of the low metabolic and biosynthetic activities of
mature chondrocytes and the nonavailability of chondrogenic cells.1−3 Many strategies have been applied to enhance the cartilage defect
repair with the ultimate aim of filling the defects with the same
morphological and functional repaired cartilage tissue. Osteochondral
allografting, periosteal and perichondral tissue grafting, chondrogenic
cell transplantation, and subchondral drilling have been widely employed
in preclinic and clinic trials.4 The concept
of tissue engineering has been used to develop cell-based repair biomaterials.5−8 Numerous studies using chondrocytes or cells with chondrogenic potential
(mesenchymal stem cells and adipose stem cells) have suggested that
different biomaterials can support the proteoglycan-containing tissues
and the formation of type II collagen (COL II).9,10 Specific
extracellular matrix components of the articular cartilage, such as
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen, play critical roles in supporting
chondrogenesis and regulating the expression of the chondrocytic phenotype.11,12

Injectable scaffolds have been paid particular attention for
cartilage
tissue engineering because of their ability to fill irregularly shaped
defects by minimally invasive procedures. The injectable tissue engineering
system has applications in numerous materials. The scaffold of an
injectable tissue engineering system must possess physical properties
that allow it to be injected via a syringe or catheter.13−15 However, when implanted in the body, the scaffold materials should
maintain a desired form or shape in defect location without diffusion
or movement, acquiring more significant mechanical properties.16 Hydrogels are a class of materials that meet
the requirements for a successful injectable tissue engineering system.
Many methods have been employed to prepare injectable in situ forming
hydrogels, including photopolymerization,17,18 enzymatic cross-linking,19,20 and chemical cross-linking
with cross-linker agents (such as glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide, genipin,
adipic dihydrazide, etc.).21−24 Unfortunately, photopolymerization usually needs
a photosensitizer and prolonged irradiation, which limit its applications.
On the other hand, toxic chemical cross-linkers are the major obstacles
for chemical cross-linking to the use of injectable in situ forming
scaffolds.25 It is worth mentioning that
alginate is most commonly used as an instant hydrogel for bone tissue
engineering because of its hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.26,27 Alginate hydrogel with different shapes can be prepared by cross-linking
at normal temperature in the absence of organic solvents. Chondrocytes
encapsulated within calcium alginate hydrogels have shown a great
promise as engineered scaffolds to repair articular cartilage, with
the chondrocytes secreting cartilage markers, such as GAGs and COL
II.28

On the other hand, most injectable
hydrogels have limitations such
as having sufficient mechanical stability and durability to support
cell proliferation/differentiation before the formation of new tissue.
One of the attempts to overcome this challenge was to use biodegradable
microparticles, which have also been applied as injectable matrices
for tissue regeneration and cell delivery.29Mixtures
of hydrogel and microspheres were widely used in cartilage repair;30 however, a simple mixing of these results in
ignoring some properties like strength moduli and environmental responsibility.

Porous biodegradable microparticles are viewed as a useful tool
for the delivery of proteins,31 antitumor
drugs,32 and temporal templates for various
tissue regeneration applications.33,34 Porous microparticles
made from block polymers, such as poly(d,l-lactic
acid) (PDLLA) and poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), were generally prepared by a water-in-oil-in-water
(w/o/w) double-emulsion solvent evaporation technique in tissue engineering.35−37 However, PDLLA and PLGA had some disadvantages, including the possibility
of acute or chronic inflammatory responses, potential localized pH
decreases because of the relative-acidity-degraded byproducts, and
a retarded clearance rate.38,39 To overcome these limitations,
amphiphilic poly(ε-caprolactone)–b-poly(ethylene
glycol)–b-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL–PEG–PCL,
abbreviated to PCEC) polymers were synthesized in our study and applied
to prepare porous microspheres, which were loaded with calcium gluconate
crystals as the cross-linker to cross-link alginate. The microspheres
can release calcium gluconate once combined with an alginate solution.
In this respect, we developed a novel hybrid injectable alginate hydrogel
with porous PCEC microspheres as a container of calcium gluconate
(MPs) and used the respective hydrogels as models for three-dimensional
(3D) scaffolds for in vitro and in vivo experiments. The suspension
of the calcium gluconate/alginate mixture loaded with porous PCEC
microspheres can be injected into a cartilage defect site and cross-linked
in situ under normal physiological conditions for about 3 min with
the release of calcium ions, thereby eliminating the need for invasive
implantation procedures and retrieval surgeries (the preparation procedure
of the hybrid hydrogel and cartilage defect repair in rabbit is shown
in Figure 1). More
specifically, the mechanical strength and the degradation rate of
the scaffold may be controlled by the incorporation of porous PCEC
microspheres. Furthermore, calcium gluconate may further enhance the
cartilage tissue repair with calcium supply.40,41 This injectable hybrid hydrogel may yield synergetic effects, such
as good mechanical strength, shape-persistent ability, stabilization
of the microspheres, and biological performance. We would expect that
this hybrid scaffold has a special advantage in cartilage and bone
engineering. Furthermore, this is an unexplored biomaterial system
so far to the best of our knowledge.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of Porous
PCEC Microspheres
The PCEC copolymer was synthesized by ring-opening
polymerization of ε-CL and PEG 4000. PCEC was successfully synthesized
by characterization with 1H NMR, as shown in Figure S1. The porous PCEC microspheres were
prepared by a double-emulsification/solvent evaporation method with
ammonium bicarbonate as the porogen. We tuned the molecular weight
of the PCEC polymers to control their structural and morphological
characteristics. As shown in Figure 2, for 30, 50, and 60 kDa PCEC polymers, the average
diameters of the microspheres were 124 ± 23, 203 ± 35, and
218 ± 40 μm, respectively. The porous structure is homogeneous,
and the pores were interconnected. With increasing molecular weight,
the microspheres became spherical, and a more porous structure could
be obtained. On the other hand, when the molecular weight of the polymer
increased, the pores become smaller (pore sizes of microspheres made
of 30, 50, and 60 kDa were ∼10, ∼8, and ∼7 μm,
respectively). Considering the more optimized morphology for cell
growth, we chose the polymer with a molecular weight of 50 kDa to
prepare porous microspheres.

the porous PCEC microspheres
made from PCEC copolymer with different molecular weights. A-1, B-1,
and C-1 are the magnifications of A-1, B-1, and C-1, respectively.

Next, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) of the microspheres (50
kDa) was observed, as shown in Figure 3A-2,A-3. The average diameter of the open pore was
about 8 μm in the dry state. The pores may be larger than 8
μm in the wet state, which was suitable for cell growth in the
inner sides of the microspheres (Figure 3A-1). The wrinkling of the microspheres in
the dry state is due to their hydrophilicity (amphiphilicity the PCEC
polymer). The porosity of the PCEC microspheres was greater than 90%,
indicating a highly interconnected porous structure.

(B-1–B-3) porous PCEC microspheres loaded with calcium gluconate
on the surface; and (C-1–C-3) porous PCEC microspheres loaded
with calcium gluconate in the holes.

2.2 Porous PCEC Microspheres as the Container
of Calcium Gluconate
Considering the insolubility of calcium
gluconate in EtOH, we have investigated the preparation method of
calcium gluconate deposited in porous PCEC microspheres. Porous PCEC
microspheres were first soaked in EtOH, and a 3% calcium gluconate
solution was added. This process was performed three times. Calcium
gluconate deposited on the surface of the porous PCEC microspheres
was observed by upright microscope and SEM (Figure 3B-1–B-3). Energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) scans obtained from the loaded calcium gluconate
crystals showed that the weight percentage of calcium is 10.09% (Figure 4A). In another situation,
porous PCEC microspheres were soaked in a 3% calcium gluconate solution
first. Then, the calcium gluconate solution was decanted, and EtOH
was added to deposit the calcium gluconate particles in the pores
of the microspheres. This process was also performed three times. The
holes of the porous PCEC microspheres were loaded with calcium gluconate,
thereby decreasing the transmittance of light (Figure 3C-1), and the microspheres became satiated
(Figure 3C-2,C-3).
EDX analysis suggested that a trace amount of calcium element was
deposited on the surface of the microspheres (Figure S2). To demonstrate calcium gluconate in the holes,
we used liquid nitrogen to facilitate cryo-fracturing of the microspheres.
As shown in Figure 4B, the broken microspheres were rough, and the calcium gluconate
crystals were in the holes of the microspheres. EDX scans demonstrated
that calcium gluconate was successfully loaded in the interior of
the porous microspheres. The percentage of calcium in the holes was
lower than that on the surface because of the interference of microspheres.
Furthermore, to quantify the calcium content, the microspheres were
soaked in water to release the whole loaded calcium ions. The amounts
of calcium gluconate deposited on the surface or inner holes of porous
PCEC microspheres measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
spectrometer (ICP-AES) were 96 and 183 μg/mg, respectively.
Considering that the calcium gluconate crystals loaded on the surface
of the microspheres tend to fall off and the time to form hydrogel
when mixed with an alginate solution was short (∼30 s), we
chose the other one (loaded in the inner pores of the microspheres)
for further study.

and (B) in the holes of porous PCEC microspheres.

2.3 Characterization of Porous PCEC Microspheres/Alginate
Hybrid Hydrogel
Calcium gluconate crystals loaded in the
pores of the microspheres (50 mg) were mixed with a 1.5% alginate
solution (0.75 mL). After homogenizing the mixture, these crystals
can release calcium ions when contacting with water to cross-link
alginate. The gel formation time was only ∼3 min, leaving enough
time to conduct the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Figure 5 displays the cross-sectional
morphology of the prepared porous PCEC microspheres/alginate hybrid
hydrogel (MPs/Alg). The hybrid hydrogel had interconnected pores of
mean diameter ∼195 μm, and the pores were partly incorporated
with the microspheres. The compressive modulus of the MPs/Alg hybrid
hydrogel scaffold was investigated. The mechanical properties of the
MPs improved significantly when they blended with the alginate hydrogel.
The MPs/Alg hybrid hydrogel displayed an increased compressive modulus
of 123.6 kPa on addition of PCEC microspheres, compared to that of
the alginate hydrogel itself (18.7 kPa).

C) the magnification of the cross section
of porous PCEC microspheres/alginate hydrogels (scale bars were 100
μm).

2.4 Cell
Morphology on PCEC Microspheres/Alginate
Hydrogel
Chondrocytes have a good tolerance to the calcium
alginate scaffold because of the inert alginate scaffold maintaining
their morphology and phenotype as reported.42 To assess the porous PCEC microspheres and the MPs/Alg hydrogel
for the cultivation of chondrocytes, articular chondrocytes were seeded
and cultured on the two scaffolds for 3 days. Then, SEM was used to
observe the chondrocytes grown on the scaffolds to evaluate cell morphology
and proliferation. Figure 6A, B shows chondrocytes growing on PCEC microspheres and MPs/Alg
hydrogel, respectively. It was found that the chondrocytes were first
anchored on the superficial area of both scaffolds and kept their
spherical morphology. Furthermore, the production of GAG is a critical
feature of cartilage cells, which plays an important role in the phenotype
regulation of the chondrocytes. As Figure 6C displays, the GAG amount of chondrocytes
culture on the microspheres/alginate hydrogel increased significantly
over time. This indicates that the microspheres/alginate hydrogel
was compatible and supplied a microenvironment, which facilitates
the proliferation of chondrocytes.

PCEC microspheres/alginate hydrogel cultured with cartilage cells

after 1, 3, and 7 days of culture with cartilage cells on the microspheres/alginate
hydrogel.

2.5 In Vivo
Formability and Absorption of Hybrid
Scaffold
To examine the application potential of using the
PCEC microspheres/alginate hydrogel for injectable therapy, the PCEC
microspheres, alginate, and hybrid scaffold were implanted into mice
for in vivo formability and degradability. The PCEC microspheres/alginate
hydrogel could be successfully administered by injection through a
syringe, instead of a surgical procedure. The scaffolds with diameter
of up to 1 cm were collected into a suspension solution for injection.
The PCEC microspheres/alginate hydrogel could pass through an 18 G
needle without eliciting a clogging problem in the needle during the
injection. Tissue mounds were formed immediately after the injection
(Figure 7C-1–C-3).
However, the microspheres cannot be concentrated in one place and
may diffuse to other sites after implantation (Figure 7A-1–A-3), which may cause inflammation
and embolization.43Also,
an 1.5% alginate adhesive solution is not stable enough to fix a circle
under the subcutaneous tissue (Figure 7B-1–B-3).

Figure 7 Fixed shapes of (A-1–A-3) porous
PCEC microspheres, (B-1–B-3)
2% alginate solution, and (C-1–C-3) porous PCEC microspheres/alginate
hydrogels after subcutaneous injection in Wistar rats.

After implantation for 1 week, the Alg and MPs/Alg
scaffold had
no obvious loss (Figure S3B-1,C-1). Over
time, progressive absorption of the implanted composite occurred.
The materials (Alg and MPs/Alg scaffold) became relatively small at
2 weeks compared to the state at 1 week (Figure S3B-2,C-2), indicating that part of the implanted composite
has been absorbed. However, the Alg group needed shorter time to be
absorbed by the body, and the remaining Alg scaffold was significantly
smaller compared to the hybrid scaffold at 3 weeks (Figure S3B-3,C-3). Thus, the longer time required for the
degradation of the MPs/Alg scaffold was suitable for cartilage tissue
engineering. Furthermore, the shape of the MPs/Alg hydrogel remained
unchanged during the implantation process. However, it is difficult
to observe the formability and absorption of PCEC microspheres (Figure S3A-1–A-3).

2.6 In Vivo
Study of the PCEC Microspheres/Alginate
Hydrogel in Rabbit Cartilage Defects
The ability of the scaffold
to improve cartilage regeneration was evaluated by the reconstruction
of full-thickness cartilage defect on the left knees of rabbits. The
images of different treated groups are presented in Figure S4. During postoperative period, the rabbits did not
show significant inflammation and rejection response. Their incised
skins healed gradually, and all animals remained in good health. Then,
we assessed the cartilage regenerative capability by micro-CT reconstruction
evaluation, histological score analysis, and immunohistochemical assessment.

2.6.1 Micro-CT Reconstruction Evaluation
In the animal experiment,
a full-thickness cartilage defect was used
as the defect model, which stretched deep beneath the tidemark, without
penetrating the subchondral bone plate.44 Thus, this defect model involved the cartilage and part of the subchondral
bone. As shown in the 3D (Figure 8A) and two-dimensional (2D) (Figure 8B) reconstruction images, the newly regenerated
tissue generally grew from the margin of defects to the central areas.
After 18 postoperative weeks, the defects treated with MPs/Alg hydrogel
and MPs/Alg hydrogel with cells supplement were mainly covered with
a new cartilage and a subchondral bone. On the contrary, the regeneration
of defects in other four groups appeared depressed, and there was
still a blank zone after 18 weeks. Then, we isolated the defect areas
as the region of interest (ROI) (Figure 8C). The regenerated cartilage and bone were
indicated by blue and gray, respectively. It is worth noting that
the defect in the MPs/Alg+ cells-treated group was almost repaired,
and a regenerated matching cartilage layer was formed.

Figure 8 Micro-CT images acquired
from (A) 3D reconstruction (red circles
indicated the defect areas), (B) 2D reconstruction in longitudinal
view (red squares indicated the defect areas), and (C) 3D reconstruction
of the repaired cartilage defect of different groups (the newly grown
cartilage and bone are indicated by blue and gray, respectively) after
operation at different periods.

2.6.2 Semiquantitative Histological Scoring Analysis
As the repair efficacy is an important feature of defect substitutes,
the regeneration percentage of bone tissue is generally marked. Because
the defect sections were treated as ROI, the quantitative data about
the volume of cartilage and subchondral bone could be analyzed. The
percentage of newly grown bone volume in the MPs/Alg group progressed
from 43.8% at 6 weeks to 89.9% at 18 weeks after implantation (Figure 9A). Moreover, 96.7%
of the osteochondral tissue was regenerated by MPs/Alg+ cells at 18
weeks, which spread the largest volume of the defect compared to that
of blank, MPs, Alg, and cells groups.

Figure 9 (A) Volume of newly formed bone tissue
and (B) histological scoring
for reparative tissues in different groups at 6, 12, and 18 weeks
after operation. (*p < 0.05).

The histological score assessment was evaluated from five
aspects,
as shown in Table S1. The score of the
MPs/Alg+ cells group was better (i.e., lower) than that of other groups
at determined time points after operation (Figure 9B); however, there was no significant difference
between the MPs/Alg group and the MPs/Alg+ cells group. The results
indicated that the scaffold alone played an important role in the
cartilage regeneration. The structure of the scaffold had space for
the growth of cartilage cells. Moreover, the characteristics of the
scaffold may enhance the immigrated MSC cells to chondrogenic differentiation.
Along with the cell proliferation, the scaffold degraded and was absorbed
by the body, and a new cartilage was formed instead of scaffold.

2.6.3 Histological Immunohistochemical Evaluation
By
H&E staining analysis, 6 weeks after treatment with the MPs/Alg+
cells, the newly formed cartilage cells were uniformly distributed
without orderly aligning in the defects, whereas few newly formed
tissues appeared in the control group (Figure 10A). A group of scaffold-treated defects
could be observed in some chondrocytic cells. It is interesting that
the MPs/Alg+ cells group regrew a layer of cartilage, which highly
expressed GAG (Figure 10B) and COL II (Figure 10C). The group of MPs/Alg also showed the recovered hyaline
cartilage and the subchondral bone. In contrast, defects in control
or those transplanted with Alg, MPs, or cells only showed a limited
repair, resulting in a negligible expression of GAG and COL II. Over
time, a number of fibrocartilage cells appeared in control, MPs, and
cell groups. The Alg-group-induced repair tissues exhibited an irregular
link with the original cartilage compared to that of the MPs/Alg+
cells and MPs/Alg groups. However, the Alg-treated group was superior
to the MPs and cells groups. It is worth noting that the MPs/Alg+
cells-treated group displayed even a normal regenerated subchondral
bone and chondrocytes. Meanwhile, it is difficult to distinguish the
interface between the repaired cartilage and the host cartilage through
the homogeneous staining of COL II and GAG. The MPs/Alg group had
a relatively thinner newly regenerated cartilage, and the junction
of this cartilage and the host cartilage was irregular. The MPs/Alg
hydrogel with cell supply showed a successful repair in the full-thickness
cartilage defect. Thus, the injectable MPs/Alg hydrogel has been demonstrated
to be an effective carrier for chondrocytes and worthy of further
investigation toward the desired clinical application. The MPs/Alg
hydrogel will also be evaluated as a carrier for other cells to regenerate
other tissues in the future.

cartilage boundary; RC and HC represent repaired cartilage and host
cartilage, respectively.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we demonstrated the feasibility of calcium gluconate
cross-linked alginate hydrogel prepared using biodegradable porous
microsphere as the cross-linker carrier as an injectable hybrid scaffold.
This injectable scaffold may be useful to meet different shape defects
and regrow cartilage layers by a minimally invasive approach. The
hybrid hydrogel has desirable features, such as interconnected pores,
enhanced compressive modulus, good formability, and reasonable degradability.
Chondrocytes seeded on the hydrogel could proliferate well and maintain
their chondrogenic property. Then, the reparative ability of the porous
PCEC microspheres/alginate hydrogel was assessed in repairing full-thickness
cartilage defects in a rabbit model. The results indicated that the
porous PCEC microspheres/alginate hydrogel is a suitable substrate
for cartilage tissue engineering.

4 Experimental
Sections
4.1 Materials
Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mn = 4000), ε-caprolactone (ε-CL),
stannous octoate (Sn(Oct)2), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA,
average Mn = 30 000–70 000)
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company. Calcium d-gluconate
monohydrate was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corp., Shanghai,
China. Alginate, ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), dichloromethane, phosphate buffer saline, and sodium hydroxide
were acquired from Kelong Chemicals, Chengdu, China. Deionized water
(18.2 MΩ cm) obtained from Milli-Q Gradient System was used
in all of the preparations.

For the animal experiment, we purchased
54 New Zealand White rabbits (male; initial weight: 2–2.5 kg)
from the Experimental Animals Center of Sichuan Province, China. They
were separated into six groups evenly on the basis of the different
time points. A total of 36 Wistar rats (male; weight: 200 g), purchased
from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd., were used to investigate the
formability and absorption of the scaffolds in vivo. All animal studies
were approved by the animal care and use committee of the State Key
Laboratory of Biotherapy, Sichuan University.

4.2 Preparation
of PCEC Copolymer
PCEC
copolymers with different designed molecular weights were synthesized
by ring-opening polymerization of poly(ε-caprolactone) (ε-CL)
and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mn = 4000)
catalyzed by Sn(Oct)2 at 130 °C in accordance with
our previous reports.45 The obtained PCEC
copolymers were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Bruker
400 spectrometer, German) and GPC (HLC-8320GPC, EcoSEC, TOSOH, Japan).

4.3 Preparation of Porous PCEC Microspheres
Porous PCEC microspheres were fabricated by a w/o/w double-emulsion
method. In brief, 3.75 mL of 5% NH4HCO3 solution
was injected into 12 mL of 62.5% PCEC methylene chloride solution
using a Powergen 700 homogenizer at 5000 rpm for 3 min. Then, the
first w/o emulsion was poured into 450 mL of 0.5% PVA solution immediately
and re-emulsified using an overhead propeller (LR-400A, Fisher Scientific
Co.) at 1500 rpm for 8 h. After methylene chloride was evaporated,
the obtained microspheres were separated by a filter net, etched with
NaOH, washed with distilled water, and lyophilized by a lyophilizer.
The morphologies of the microspheres were observed by a digital image
system (Nikon E 600 Microscope with a Nikon Digital Camera DXM 1200,
Nikon Corporation, Japan) and SEM (JSM-5900LV, JEOL, Japan).

4.4 Calcium Gluconate Deposited in PCEC Microspheres
Porous
PCEC microspheres were soaked in a 3% calcium gluconate
solution for 3 h. Then, the entire calcium gluconate solution was
decanted, and EtOH was added to deposit calcium gluconate in the pores
of PCEC microspheres. The above process was conducted three times.
Initially, when the microspheres were soaked in EtOH with the reverse
sequence, calcium gluconate was loaded on the surface of the microspheres.
The obtained calcium gluconate-loaded microspheres were lyophilized.
The morphologies of the calcium gluconate deposited in the microspheres
were observed by SEM, and elemental analysis was performed by an EDX
setup installed in the SEM. The amounts of calcium gluconate were
measured by ICP-AES (SPECTRO ARCOS, Spectro, Germany).

4.5 Preparation and Characterizations of PCEC
Microspheres/Alginate Hydrogel
First, 10 mL of 1.5% stock
alginate solution was prepared. Then, 50 mg of calcium d-gluconate
monohydrate-loaded microspheres were mixed with the alginate stock
solution (0.75 mL) while homogenizing the mixture to obtain a homogeneous
distribution of microspheres and calcium ion cross-linking. The cross-sectional
morphologies of the microspheres/alginate hydrogel were analyzed by
SEM after lyophilization. The mechanical properties of the PCEC microspheres/alginate
(MPs/Alg) hydrogel were measured by an Instron 5500 mechanical tester
(Instron Cor.).

4.6 Cartilage Cells Culture
on the PCEC Microspheres
and Hybrid Microspheres/Alg Hydrogel
Primary articular cartilage
cells were obtained from the knee joints of newborn rabbits. The cartilage
layers were isolated and cut into small pieces, and 0.2% collagenase
II was used to digest the cartilage slices. To obtain the chondrocytes,
the digested cell suspension was filtered and centrifuged. The primary
chondrocytes were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
with 100 U/mL of penicillin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 μg/mL
of streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. When the chondrocytes
were cultured to passage 3, they were digested to grow on scaffolds;
1.0 × 104 chondrocytes were added into the sterilized
microspheres and the hybrid hydrogel in 24-well culture plates. The
cell-seeded plates were kept in an incubator for predetermined times.
Then, the chondrocytes/scaffolds composites were fixed in 10% formalin
solution, dehydrated in graded ethanol series, and observed by SEM.
The GAG contents for different time intervals were also analyzed.

4.7 In Vivo Formability and Absorbability Investigation
The formability and biocompatibility of the microspheres/alginate
hydrogel were in vivo carried out by implanting the scaffolds into
the back subcutaneous tissue of Wistar rats. Cobalt-60 irradiation
of 25 kGy for 2 h (Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences) was applied
to sterilize the porous microspheres in this study. The alginate solution
was filtrated by a 0.22 μm filter membrane for sterilization.
The microspheres, alginate solution, and their mixture were separately
injected into the back subcutaneous tissue of the rats. Then, three
rats in each group at each time point were sacrificed by an overdose
of chloral hydrate. The residual scaffolds in the subcutaneous tissues
were photographed to record the formability and absorption of scaffold
and tissue appearance around the treated site.

4.8 Cartilage
Defect Repair in Vivo
The
cartilage defect experiment in vivo was carried out in our previous
study.46 Briefly, we created full-thickness
defect (thickness: 3 mm; diameter: 4 mm) through the articular cartilage
and subchondral bone of the patellar groove using an electric drill.
The cartilage defects in the left leg of New Zealand White rabbits
were treated with nothing, microspheres, alginate hydrogel, cartilage
cells, microsphere/alginate hydrogel, and microsphere/alginate hydrogel
with cell supplement (each group, n = 9). The animals
were given antibiotic for 1 week postoperatively, housed at a constant
temperature (22 °C), and given food and tap water. Joint samples
were gathered at predetermined time points after operation and processed
for micro-CT reconstruction and histological analysis. A micro-CT
scanner (Y. Cheetah, YXLON International GmbH, Germany) was used to
reconstruct the cartilage defect and analyze the results. The scan
settings were as follows: X-ray voltage = 56 kV, X-ray current = 61
μA, scaling coefficient = 50, and voxel resolution = 0.012 mm.
The scan images were then reconstructed to create a 3D geometry using
VGStudioMax software. For histological examination, the tissues underwent
a series of processes and were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin
(H&E), Safrannin-O (Saf-O), and Collagen type II (COL II).
