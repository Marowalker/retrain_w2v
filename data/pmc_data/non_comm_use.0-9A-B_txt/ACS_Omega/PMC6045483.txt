The
synthesis of atomically thin boron sheets on a silver substrate
opened a new area in the field of two-dimensional systems. Similar
to hydrogenated and halogenated graphene, the uniform coating of borophene
with fluorine atoms can lead to new derivatives of borophene with
novel properties. In this respect, we explore the possible structures
of fluorinated borophene for varying levels of coverage (BnF) by using first-principles methods. Following the
structural optimizations, phonon spectrum analysis and ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations are performed to reveal the stability of the
obtained structures. Our results indicate that while fully fluorinated
borophene (BF) cannot be obtained, stable configurations with lower
coverage levels (B4F and B2F)
can be attained. Unveiling the stable structures, we explore the mechanical,
electronic, and thermal properties of (BnF). Fluorination significantly alters the mechanical properties of
the system, and remarkable results, including direction-dependent
variation of Young’s modulus and a switch from a negative to
positive Poisson’s ratio, are obtained. However, the metallic
character is preserved for low coverage levels, and metal to semiconductor
transition is obtained for B2F. The heat capacity at a
low temperature increases with an increasing F atom amount but converges
to the same limiting value at high temperatures. The enhanced stability
and unique properties of fluorinated borophene make it a promising
material for various high-technology applications in reduced dimensions.

Introduction
Following the realization
of graphene and revealing its novel mechanical,
electronic, and optical properties,1 great
amounts of theoretical and experimental studies have been devoted
to investigate alternative two-dimensional (2D) materials.2 In this quest, various 2D monoelemental structures
beyond graphene (such as silicene,3,4 germanene,5 stanene,6 phosphorene,7 antimonene,8 and borophene9,10) have been realized. The main focus of these studies is not only
to explore new systems but also to integrate these materials into
next-generation nanoscale applications and to enhance the performance
of these devices by tuning their intrinsic properties.

Among
2D monoelemental structures, the recent synthesis of an atomically
thin boron sheet (i.e., borophene) on an Ag(111) substrate with a
buckled triangular structure9 has aroused
increasing interest because of its exceptional properties. Contrary
to all-known bulk boron allotropes that are semiconductors at ambient
conditions, borophene presents metallic behavior with strong anisotropy.9 Furthermore, buckled borophene has been predicted
to display novel mechanical properties. As an example, the Young’s
modulus is reported to be 170 GPa·nm along the corrugated direction
and 398 GPa·nm along the uncorrugated direction,9 which is even higher than that of graphene (340 GPa·nm).11 The system also has a negative Poisson’s
ratio because of the out-of-plane buckling.9 A theoretical investigation on thermal properties indicates that
the thermal conductivity of borophene is also anisotropic and low
because of the strong phonon–phonon scattering, and negative
thermal expansion coefficients are obtained for both directions.12,13 In a computational study, large optical anisotropy with high optical
transparency is reported.14

In addition
to the buckled phase, planar boron sheets with periodic
holes are also grown epitaxially on an Ag(111) substrate,10 and various stable phases with novel properties
are theoretically predicted.15−18 A comprehensive search on the possible structures
indicates that orthorhombic 2D phases of boron can have a distorted
Dirac cone and possess massless Dirac fermions with strongly direction-dependent
quasiparticle group velocities.19 Borophene
sheets can also display an intrinsic superconducting behavior at low
temperatures15,20 which can be modified by strains
and dopings.21 The anisotropic high bending
flexibility makes borophene an ideal candidate for fabricating flexible
electronic devices.22 These extraordinary
properties suggest borophene as a promising material for various technological
applications.23−25

Chemical modification, particularly hydrogenation,
is one of the
well-known methods to tailor the intrinsic properties of 2D materials
and even new derivatives can be formed.26−29 Besides hydrogenation, halogenation
(especially with fluorine atoms) is another way of coating 2D materials
because of their high electronegativity. Therefore, structural, electronic,
and mechanical properties of halogenated graphene,30−33 silicene,34 germanene,35,36 arsenene,37 and tin38 have been investigated
in detail. Fully fluorinated graphene (fluorographene, CF) has been
synthesized and found that CF is a high-quality insulator with an
optical gap of ∼3 eV.39 Furthermore,
it has high thermal and chemical stabilities and reported to be mechanically
stiff but stretchable.39 Bilayer fluorinated
graphene is investigated theoretically as well and compared with graphane
and fluorographene.40 In addition to graphene,
recently, the effect of halogenation on the electronic properties
of silicene is studied and a band gap opening upon halogenation is
reported.34 For germanene, the interaction
with halogen atoms enhances the spin–orbit coupling and quantum
spin hall effect can be realized at ambient conditions.35 For the diatomic 2D structures, chlorination
of AlN nanosheets is studied based on first-principles methods, and
it is shown that half-chlorination (saturation of only Al sites) converts
the semiconducting system into a half-metallic ferromagnet.41 Furthermore, although 2D BN is an insulator,
decoration with fluorine can make it a ferromagnetic half-metal or
an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with a narrow band gap.42

As in-plane bonds resulting from sp2 hybridizations
are in general stronger than the out-of-plane bonds, buckled triangular
borophene is less stable than planar porous borophene polymorphs where
two- and three-center bondings are balanced. Therefore, the interaction
with halogen atoms not only modifies the intrinsic properties of borophene
but can also enhances the stability by the occupation of out-of-plane
bonding states. Despite its importance, to the best of our knowledge,
only the interaction of single halogen atoms/molecules with borophene
is studied,43 and halogenation has not
been explored yet. With this motivation, in this work, we investigate
the possible fluorinated derivatives of borophene and analyze the
mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties of the stable systems
by using ab initio methods. Starting from the interaction of a single
F atom with borophene, we study BnF (n = 1, 2, and 4) structures with single- and double-sided
coverages and consider various possible geometries. The level of coverage
is defined by Θ (%) = 1/n, referring to the
ratio of one F atom to n C atoms in percentage. The
stability of the obtained structures is tested by phonon spectrum
analyses and high-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations. While B4F and B2F systems result
in stable configurations, fully fluorinated borophene (BF) is found
to be unstable at ambient conditions. The mechanical properties of
thermodynamically stable systems are analyzed, and remarkable results,
including a drastic change in Young’s modulus and a switch
from a negative to positive Poisson’s ratio, are obtained.
Additionally, electronic structure calculations indicate a metal to
semiconductor transition at a high level of coverage. Finally, thermal
properties are explored, and the variations of heat capacity and entropy
with Θ are revealed.

Results and Discussions
Atomic Structure and Stability
We start with the structural
optimization of monolayer-buckled borophene (i.e., borophene) which
is shown in Figure 1a. The calculated lattice constants of borophene are |a| = 1.62 Å and |b| = 2.87 Å, which are in
good agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical results.9,14,44 Borophene has a buckled triangular
structure where the adjacent rows of boron atoms are alternately raised
up or lowered down (along b) with a buckling height, h = 0.91 Å. The B–B bond length along b(dB–Bb) is 1.87 Å, whereas it is
1.62 Å along a (dB–Ba). The bond
angle θ = 100.1° indicates that the atomic orbitals of
borophene possess sp3-like hybridization to enhance the
stabilization. High h induces strong anisotropy,14,28,45 and the corrugated structure
makes the surface chemically reactive. Some of the in-plane antibonding
states of borophene are occupied, which tends the system to donate
electrons and also induces structural instability.46,47

Dark and light pink represent boron atoms which are on the downward
and upward planes, respectively, and blue represents F atoms. Lattice
constants (a,b), dihedral angle (θ), and the buckling height
(h) are shown.

Before investigating the fluorination of borophene, we first
examine
the interaction of a single F atom with borophene. Understanding the
adsorption process of a single atom is crucial to reveal the fluorinated
derivates. In our previous study, by taking a large 7 × 4 supercell
(with lattice parameters of 11.30 and 11.45 Å), we showed that
F strongly binds to the borophene surface and the top of the B atom
on the upper layer (T-site) is the most favorable adsorption site.43 The obtained energy barriers along the diffusion
paths are very high (1.26 eV along a and 0.84 eV along b), indicating low possibility of migration. Moreover, F2 dissociates spontaneously without an activation barrier on
the borophene surface, suggesting that adsorption of F is an exothermic
process.43 Here, we repeat these calculations
for a 2 × 2 supercell (B8F with Θ = 12.5%) where
F–F interactions become significant. Considering the symmetry
of borophene, five different F adsorption sites are investigated and
presented in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Similar to single-atom adsorption, an F atom always prefers the
T-site. The Eb is calculated as 5.42 eV,
and the increase in Eb with respect to
single F adsorption indicates an attractive interaction between the
F atoms at this level of coverage. We further investigate the possible
adsorption sites for two F (with Θ = 6.25%) and four F atoms
(with Θ = 12.5%) in a 4 × 4 supercell. We find that increasing
the number of F atoms does not change the adsorption site of F. The
resulting structures and obtained Eb values
are summarized in Figures S2–S4 and Table S1 (Supporting Information). Accordingly, for high coverage levels,
we only consider the T-site for the adsorption of F atoms.

Inspired
by the studies on hydrogenation of borophene46,48−50 (i.e., borophane) and using the F atom adsorption
results, we increase the level of F coverage gradually and investigate
the structural properties and energetics of BnF. The obtained results are summarized in Table 1. We first consider B4F(s), single-sided fluorination of borophene with Θ = 25%.
One-sided coverage corresponds to the case when borophene is on a
substrate or on another 2D system. Among the possible geometries,
the lowest energy and stable (see below) configuration are obtained
and presented in Figure 1b. In this case, the F atoms are located on top of alternating B
atoms along both directions. Upon relaxation, its h increases by 0.3 Å compared to the pristine borophene and dB–F is calculated as 1.35 Å. The
attractive interaction between F atoms increases Eb when compared to the cases with lower Θ. We also
try the possibility of B2F(s) by attaching F atoms to each
B atom on the upper layer (see Figure S5, Supporting Information for initial configurations). It is found that the
calculated Eb reduced down to 1.32 eV
and also the structure is significantly distorted because of a strong
repulsive F–F interaction. Thus, a stable B2F(s)
structure with Θ = 50% cannot be obtained.

bond lengths along a and b (dB–Bb and dB–Bb in Å) are listed.
“s” and “d” in parenthesis indicate single-
and double-sided coverages, respectively. Only the results for stable
configurations are reported.

As a next step, we investigate B2F(d), the double-sided
fluorination of borophene with Θ = 50%, as presented in Figure 1c. The armchair B–B
bonds are weakened in this configuration, and dB–B becomes nonuniform and increases to 1.75–1.84
Å. The situation for dB–Bb is more complicated, and
it increases (decreases) for B atoms with (without) F. Furthermore, h becomes 1.70 Å, which is significantly larger than
that of bare borophene, resulting from the considerable modification
of B–B bonds. The dB–F is
calculated as 1.35 Å, which remained the same as B4F(s). The Eb reduced to 5.02 eV but still
high, indicating a strong binding.

Finally, double-sided full
fluorination of borophene (BF) similar
to the proposed structure of borophane (BH)46,49 is investigated and three possible initial configurations are presented
in Figure S6 (Supporting Information).
BH is a stable configuration46 with each
boron atoms being passivated by hydrogen atoms, resulting in a full
coverage (Θ = 100%). The hydrogenation of borophene has remarkably
increased the lattice constant along a by 0.26 Å,46 compared to the pristine structure.9 Accordingly, dB–Ba in borophane
is significantly stretched (0.32 Å), whereas h is almost preserved.46 Contrary to BH,
the optimized configurations for BF cannot be obtained. Either the
structure of borophene is drastically distorted or the F atoms form
a cluster and do not bind to B atoms. Our results indicate that dB–Ba is too small to accommodate F atoms on each
B atom, and the repulsive F–F interaction at this level of
coverage induces instability in this geometry. As a final effort,
considering the lattice expansion in BH and the possibility of a structural
phase transformation upon fluorination, we consider a 2 × 2 supercell
(to remove the possible constraints)
and gradually increase the lattice constants while optimizing for
each case. Interestingly, we notice two geometric transitions upon
expansion along the uncorrugated direction, and two possible BF phases
are obtained. In the first phase, namely, a buckled honeycomb structure
is obtained at |a| = 4.63 Å and |b|
= 5.72 Å. dB–B becomes almost
uniform along both directions and calculated as 1.86 Å. The h slightly increases and becomes 0.93 Å. The details
of the transition are presented in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). In the second phase, namely, a buckled
rectangular (almost square) structure (Figure S11, Supporting Information) is obtained at |a| =
5.23 Å and |b| = 4.76 Å. dB–B also becomes uniform and elongates to 1.97
Å, whereas h decreases and measured as 0.86
Å. Last, it should be noted that Ef > 0 for all considered cases, revealing that fluorination with
varying
Θ is an exothermic process and can be achieved without an energy
barrier.

Even though the structural optimization and binding
(or formation)
energies give an idea about the possible BnF structures, they do not guarantee the thermodynamic stability.
In this respect, we analyzed the phonon spectra of optimized BnF systems, which are the candidate-fluorinated
derivatives of borophene. The phonon dispersions of stable configurations
including the pristine borophene are shown in Figure 2. The unit cell of borophene contains only
two atoms; hence, its phonon spectrum is characterized by three acoustic
and three optical phonon branches. The acoustic branches are the in-plane
longitudinal acoustic, the transverse acoustic, and the out-of-plane
acoustic (ZA) modes. As seen in Figure 2a, there is a small imaginary frequency in ZA along
the Γ–X direction, which implies that
the free-standing borophene is prone to instability against long-wavelength
transversal waves, which clarifies the stripe formation along the
armchair direction in the synthesis of borophene.9

Figure 2 Calculated phonon dispersion curves and atomic configurations for
AIMD simulations at 1000 K (a–d) bare borophene, (b–e)
B4F, and (c–f) B2F. Lower panels show
the snapshots of the atomic configurations for AIMD simulations at
1000 K for the related structures.

The phonon dispersion curves of B4F(s) and B2F(d) are illustrated in Figure 2b,c for 2 × 1 and 2 × 2 unit cells, respectively.
All frequencies are positive excepting the lowest ZA mode which exhibits
a slight softening around Γ-point. The absence of phonon modes
with a negative frequency suggests the stability of the considered
structures. When the phonon spectra of unstable structures of B2F(d) are examined, negative frequencies are the ZA modes,
corresponding to the out-of-plane vibrations (see Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information). Such phonon modes are
eliminated for the configuration, which is shown in Figure 2c, by placing F atoms along
a zigzag direction at alternate sites that reconfigures B atoms along
the corrugated direction. We also examine a lower level of coverage,
namely, B4F(d) structure (Θ = 25%), but phonon spectrum
analysis indicates that this configuration is not stable (see Figure
S12, Supporting Information). In a similar manner, BF phases obtained
upon structural transition (see above) are not stable configurations
(see Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information).

Following the phonon analyses, we tested the thermodynamic
stability
of the structures at finite temperatures by using AIMD calculations.
We consider a 6 × 3 supercell and perform AIMD calculations at
increasing temperatures starting from 200 K and reaching up to 1000
K in 2.5 ps total simulation time. The snapshots from AIMD simulations
are shown in Figure 2d–f. As expected, bare borophene preserves its initial structure
at high temperatures. Similarly, both B4F(s) and B2F(d) remain stable exempting the small fluctuations due to
the temperature effect (see Figure 2e,f). Furthermore, neither cluster formations nor local
defects in the structures occur, which also indicates the stability
of fluorinated derivatives of borophene even at high temperatures.
Finally, AIMD results reveal that the BF phase with the honeycomb
phase is not stable even at 200 K, although the softening in the phonon
dispersion has been reduced (see Figure S10, Supporting Information). These results point out that a stable BF structure
similar to borophane could not be obtained as fluorination results
in drastic structural alternations leading to phase transitions (see
above) which induce instability at ambient conditions. It should be
also noted that our results do not fully exclude the possibility of
obtaining BF with different phases and/or geometries. Various unstable
configurations of halogenated derivatives of monoelement 2D systems
are also reported,30,31,51 indicating that the stability strongly depends on the geometry,
structure, and level of coverage.

Mechanical Properties
After revealing the stable configurations,
the mechanical properties of pristine and fluorinated borophene structures
[B4F(s) and B2F(d)] are investigated. First,
the elastic tensors are computed and nonzero elastic constants (c11, c12, c22, and c66) are
listed in Table 2.
The elastic tensors are then used to calculate the mechanical response
of the system, namely, Young’s modulus (Y),
shear modulus (G), and Poisson’s ratio (ν).
Young’s moduli of pristine borophene along a and b are calculated as Ya = 376.21 N/m and Yb = 149.45 N/m, respectively, and they are in good agreement
with previously reported results.9,44,52 Interestingly, for both B4F(s) and B2F(d), while Ya dramatically decreases, an increase in Yb is noticed. The amount of change is proportional
with Θ. When compared to bare borophene, dB–Ba increases in B4F(s) and becomes 1.82 Å. This
elongation in bond length results in the reduction of Ya. In a similar manner, for B2F(d), dB–Ba is also elongated and becomes
1.75 and 1.84 Å. Nonuniformity in addition to elongation further
reduces Ya. On the other
hand, dB–Bb becomes nonuniform upon fluorination
and calculated as 1.72 and 2.05 Å for B4F(s) and 1.68,
1.82, and 2.41 Å for B2F(d). The contraction of B–B
bonds corresponding to B atoms without F induces an increase in Yb. It should be noted that
anisotropy in mechanical response still remained. When compared with
BH, hydrogenation leads to a reduction in Y along
both directions unlike fluorination as no contraction in bond lengths
is obtained.52G also
decreases with increasing Θ in parallel with hydrogenation;
however, the amount of reduction in BnF is less drastic than BH. A summary of the mechanical properties
of the currently studied systems and the available data in literature
are presented in Table S2 (Supporting Information) for comparison.

and Poisson’s Ratios (ν) of Bare Borophene, B4F(s), and B2(d)

B2F(d)	130.12	200.76	6.17	57.35	129.93	200.46	0.03	0.05	
Similar to phospherene,53 borophene
also has a negative Poisson’s ratio (ν).9,52 Consistent with previous theoretical and experimental studies, we
obtain negative νa and νb values. As in the case of BH, interestingly,
ν becomes positive along both directions upon fluorination.
While νb remains constant at 0.05,
νa decreases from 0.07 to 0.03 for
B4F(s) and B2F(d), respectively. The decrease
in νa with increasing Θ can
be correlated with structural deformations along the corrugated direction.
Last, when compared, the calculated values for ν are smaller
than that reported for borophane.

Electronic Properties
Next, we examine the electronic
properties of bare borophene and BnF.
The resulting electronic band structures are presented in Figure 3. Our results indicate
that pristine borophene is metallic along the Γ–X and S–Y directions,
which are parallel to a. On the other hand, buckling
along b results in energy differences of 4.24 and 9.63
eV along the Y–Γ and X–S directions, respectively (Figure 3a). These results are in good
agreement with the literature, confirming the strong anisotropy in
electronic properties.9,14 We find that a low level of F
coverage does not alter the metallic behavior of borophene; however,
anisotropy in electronic conduction can be altered.43 For B4F(s), while metallic behavior is retained,
energy differences between the band levels in the vicinity of Fermi
level significantly decrease compared to its bare counterpart (Figure 3b). This will affect
the possible interband transitions and can be interesting for the
optical transitions in the mid-/near-infrared and visible spectral
range. On the other hand, in B2F(d), the metal to semiconductor
transition is obtained with an indirect band gap opening of 0.40 eV
between the X–S path and
the Γ-point, as shown in Figure 3c. The metal to semiconductor transition can be explained
by the saturation of pz orbitals of B
atoms (occupation of out-of-plane bonding states) upon fluorination.
In line with the tendency of borophene to donate electrons, Bader
charge analysis confirms the charge transfer from B to F atoms upon
adsorption. The accepted charges by F atoms are calculated as 0.81|e| and 0.78|e| for B4F and B2F, respectively. The calculated values are larger than the
case of BH where 0.72|e| is transferred to H atoms.46 The charge distribution analysis also confirms
the charge localization on F atoms and ionic nature of the B–F
bond.43,54 As electronic band gaps are underestimated
at the density functional theory–generalized gradient approximation
(DFT–GGA) level, we repeat the electronic band structure calculations
by the HSE06 hybrid functional. While the metallic band structures
are not modified, the indirect band gap of B2F(d) is corrected
to 0.89 eV. As the electronic structure of BnF strongly depends on the structure, different geometries of
coverage and tensile/compressive strain can lead to an indirect to
a direct band gap feature. When compared with borophane, BH is semimetallic
with asymmetric Dirac cones. Most of the states around the Fermi level
of borophene are removed after hydrogenation, and the remaining states
originating from the in-plane px and py orbitals
lead to band states with linear dispersion.46,48−50 However, for BnF, the
out-of-plane pz orbitals
dominate the states around the Fermi level leading to metallic and
semiconducting states instead of Dirac cones.

dotted lines. The Fermi level is set to 0 eV and shown by dashed,
green lines.

Thermal Properties
In the final section, we present
the results on the thermal properties of bare and fluorinated borophene.
2D materials possess novel thermal properties and have shown a great
potential for various applications including thermoelectric energy
generation. Thermal rectification, negative thermal resistance, and
tunable thermal conductivity are reported for 2D systems and their
heterostructures.55−58 For borophene, a very low anisotropic thermal conductivity (14.3
W/mK) which could be useful for thermoelectric and thermal insulation
applications is reported.12,13 Additionally, remarkable
negative thermal expansion coefficients are calculated along both
directions.12 In this section, the specific
heat values at a constant volume (CV) and entropy (S) are calculated using the
expressions59 which are summarized in the Supporting Information. For the sake of comparison,
the results of graphene are also presented in the Supporting Information, and the obtained quantities are found
to be in agreement with the theoretical results and experimental data.60

As expected, CV increases with temperature and converges to a constant
value of 24 J K–1 mol–1 for both
pristine borophene and BnF, as shown in Figure 4. This limiting value
is higher than that obtained for graphene (see Figure S13, Supporting Information).60CV for bare borophene
at room temperature is slightly lower than those of B4F(s)
and B2F(d). Depending on Θ, CV slightly increases at low temperatures in
parallel with the increase in entropy. Higher CV of BnF than
bare borophene at low temperatures can be due to the higher phonon
density of states that arise by the weak coupling between F and B
atoms rather than the stiff bonds between B atoms.

heat at a constant volume (CV) with temperature for bare borophene,
B4F(s), and B2F(d). The inset shows the variation
of entropy (S).

Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the possible
fluorinated derivatives
of borophene and explored their mechanical, electronic, and thermal
properties. We showed that F atoms strongly bind on top of B atoms
in the upper layer and adsorption is an exothermic process. Revealing
the interaction of a single F atom with borophene, we studied the
possible BnF (n = 1,
2, and 4) structures considering single- and double-sided coverages.
The stability analyses performed by a phonon spectrum and high-temperature
AIMD calculations indicated that while B4F (25% coverage)
and B2F (50% coverage) resulted in stable configurations,
BF (100% coverage) could not be obtained. A full coverage together
with applying a tensile strain led to a geometric transition from
a triangular to hexagonal or a rectangular borophene structure. However,
this BF phases could not remain stable at ambient temperatures. When
compared with pristine borophene, the Young’s modulus of BnF drastically decreases (up to 70%) along
the uncorrugated a-direction, on the other hand increases
(although less significantly) along the corrugated b-direction.
In addition, a switch from a negative to positive Poisson’s
ratio was obtained upon fluorination. We showed that while the metallic
character is maintained at low levels of coverage, increasing the
F concentration resulted in a metal to semiconductor transition. Finally,
the fluorination of borophene increased the specific heat with respect
to bare borophene at low temperatures. Our results revealed stable
fluorinated derivatives of borophene with versatile properties and
enhanced stability, suggesting the BnF
systems as promising new 2D materials for various nanoscale applications.

Computational
Methodology
The first-principles calculations based on DFT61,62 are performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).63 We use projector-augmented wave potentials64 with 500 eV kinetic energy cutoff, and the exchange–correlation
potential is described by the GGA with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional.65 The energy band gap,
which is underestimated in this scheme, is corrected by the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE) hybrid functional,66,67 constructed by mixing
25% of nonlocal Fock exchange with 75% of PBE exchange and 100% of
PBE correlation energy. The conjugate gradient method is used to optimize
the atomic positions and lattice constants without any constraint.
The convergence criteria for total energy and atomic forces between
sequential steps have been set to 10–5 eV and
0.01 eV/Å, respectively. The Brillouin zone for the primitive
unit cell has been sampled by using a 25 × 19 × 1 Γ-centered
Monkhorst–Pack scheme.68 For larger
supercells, the k-point sampling has been scaled
accordingly. A vacuum spacing of 15 Å is placed along the nonperiodic
axis to eliminate interactions between periodic images.

To test
the thermodynamical stability of the obtained structures,
a phonon spectrum is calculated by using the density functional perturbation
theory69 implemented in VASP.70 Furthermore, the stability at high temperatures
is tested by using AIMD simulations. All AIMD calculations are performed
in 6 × 3 supercells, with the temperature starting from 200 K
and then gradually being increased up to 1000 K. The time step used
for the integration of equations of motion is set to 1 fs, and the
total time for the simulation is 2.5 ps.

The binding energy
(Eb) and formation
energy (Ef) per F atom are calculated
using the following expressions, Eb =
[ET(borophene) + mF·ET(F) – ET(BnF)]/mF and Ef = [mF2·ET(F2) + ET(borophene) – ET(BnF)]/mF, where ET(borophene), ET(F), ET(F2), and ET(BnF) are the total energies of pristine borophene, single F atom, F2 molecule, and fluorinated borophene (at different compositions),
respectively. mF and mF2 are the number of F atoms and F2 molecules, respectively. Accordingly, Eb > 0 indicates that the adsorption is energetically favorable,
and Ef > 0 implies that fluorination
is an exothermic
process.
