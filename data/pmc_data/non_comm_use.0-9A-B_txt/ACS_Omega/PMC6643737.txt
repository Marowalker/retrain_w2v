Glucosinolates, which are unique
to Brassicaceae vegetables, have diverse biological
activities, including antimicrobial,
antioxidant, and anticancer actions. In this study, we applied hydrophilic
interaction chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC–MS/MS)
to the simultaneous quantification of 22 glucosinolates in 12 Brassicaceae vegetables, including pak choi, choy sum, Chinese
cabbage, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, Kai Lan, Brussels sprouts,
rocket salad, daikon radish, red cherry radish, and watercress. Significant
differences in concentration and composition of glucosinolates were
observed among these vegetables. Cabbage had the highest level of
total glucosinolates (μg/g dry weight: 19 551.2 ±
1317.7), whereas Kai Lan had the lowest level (7611.3 ± 868.4).
Aliphatic and indole glucosinolates were the major components in the
12 vegetables ranging from 76 to 100%, except watercress (37%). On
the basis of the content of glucosinolates, the 12 vegetables were
well distinguishable and classified according to their morphological
taxonomy. This study presents a HILIC–MS/MS approach for quantification
of glucosinolates, and demonstrates the potential of glucosinolate
profiles for Brassicaceae species identification.

==== Body
Introduction
Glucosinolates are
secondary plant metabolites that occur naturally
in the family Brassicaceae,1 which are a group of sulfur-containing glucosides having a common
core structure with a β-d-thioglucose group, a sulfonated
aldoxime moiety, and a variable side chain (=R) derived from amino
acids. Depending on the variable R group, glucosinolates can be categorized
into three major classes: aliphatic, indole, and aromatic glucosinolates.2 To defend against attacks by harmful organisms,
glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed by the endogenous enzyme myrosinase
into various breakdown products, including isothiocyanates, nitriles,
thiocyanates, epithionitriles, and oxazolidinethiones.3 Because of its characteristic aroma, glucosinolate-containing
plant material is commonly used in the biofumigation for plant protection
against soil-borne pathogens in agriculture and horticulture.4 Recently, glucosinolates have been of interest
for their diverse biological activities, ranging from antimicrobial,
antioxidant, and anticancer actions.1,5−7

Brassicaceae vegetables are widely distributed
and consumed in Asia, and include species such as Brassica
oleracea (e.g., cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage,
broccoli, and Kai Lan), Brassica rapa (e.g., pak choi, choy sum, and Chinese cabbage), Nasturtium officinale (e.g., watercress), Raphanus sativus (e.g., daikon radish and red cherry
radish), and Eruca sativa (e.g., rocket
salad).8 Evidence indicates that the concentration
and composition of glucosinolates may vary among and within individual Brassicaceae species.9 Considering
the enormous potential of biodiversity, screening of glucosinolate-enriched Brassicaceae species is of particular interest for nutritionists,
agribusiness, and consumers at large. Moreover, recent studies indicate
that species classification based on the secondary metabolites has
emerged as an effective chemotaxonomic tool, providing detailed biochemical
information about the differences and similarities among plant species.10 So far, there are only a handful of studies
on quantification of glucosinolates in cruciferous or Brassica species; thus, it is interesting to explore the potential of use
of quantitative glucosinolate profiles for the chemotaxonomic classification
of Brassicaceae species.

To date, more than
130 glucosinolates have been reported in Brassicaceae vegetables;11 however,
only a small portion of them (<10%) have been quantified because
of the difficulties in trace-level determination of most glucosinolates
using routine analytical methods. In general, reversed-phase liquid
chromatography (RPLC) coupled to diode-array detector (DAD) or mass
spectrometry (MS) is the most frequently used method for quantification
of glucosinolates.12,13 In a recent study,14 a total of 12 glucosinolates were measured in
9 Brassica crops using RPLC–DAD, which is
the largest number of glucosinolates quantified in an individual study
so far. Owing to their biochemical properties, high volume of consumption,
and health effects, it is thus time to develop more sensitive and
selective methods for quantification of glucosinolates in vegetables.
In 2007, Wade et al. for the first time applied hydrophilic interaction
liquid chromatography (HILIC) for quantification of glucosinolates,
but only three glucosinolates were measured in their study including
glucoraphanin, glucoriberin, and sinigrin.15 HILIC utilizes a gradient of increasing aqueous content to elute
analytes from a hydrophilic stationary phase, which is a more appropriate
analytical method for analysis of polar components.16,17 Thus, it is a more effective technique than RPLC for separation
of glucosinolates because of their highly polar nature.

In this
study, we established an analytical method based on HILIC–MS/MS
to quantify and compare the glucosinolate profiles across 12 commonly
consumed Brassicaceae vegetables in Asia, including
cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, Kai Lan, pak choi,
choy sum, Chinese cabbage, watercress, daikon radish, red cherry radish,
and rocket salad. Moreover, the potential use of glucosinolate profiles
for Brassicaceae species classification was explored
(Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
Method Validation
In this study,
an analytical method
based on HILIC–MS/MS was developed for the quantitative analysis
of glucosinolates. Compared to the previously reported HILIC method
for determination of limited glucosinolates,15 our present method allowed simultaneous quantification of a panel
of 22 glucosinolates using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
mode, with a powerful separation in a relatively short analysis time
(Figure 2). The optimized
MRM conditions of 22 glucosinolates are shown in Table 1. In the validation process
for the new method, we examined its limit of detection (LOD), limit
of quantification (LOQ), linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery
(Table 2). LODs under
the present chromatographic conditions, measured with a signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) of 3, ranged from 0.001 to 0.028 μg/g dry weight.
LOQs, measured with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10, ranged from
0.003 to 0.093 μg/g dry weight. The calibration curves and correlation
coefficients were determined using a linear regression model. Good
linear regression with r2 > 0.997 was
obtained in all relevant ranges. For intrabatch and interbatch precision
and accuracy, the relative standard deviation (RSD) values ranged
from 2.00 to 9.24 and 3.33 to 9.95%, respectively. The mean recoveries
were from 76.46 to 120.14% with RSD less than 9.07%. These results
indicated that the newly developed method was satisfactory with acceptable
precision, accuracy, reproducibility, and recovery.

Glucosinolate
Profiles
A total of 22 glucosinolates
were quantified in this study, including 14 aliphatic glucosinolates
(sinigrin, glucoiberin, glucocheirolin, glucoraphasatin, glucosativin,
glucoerucin, glucoraphenin, glucoraphanin, gluconapin, progoitrin,
epiprogoitrin, glucoalyssin, glucobrassicanapin, and gluconapoleiferin),
4 indolic glucosinolates (glucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin,
and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin), and 4 aromatic glucosinolates (glucotropaeolin,
gluconasturtiin, glucobarbarin, and glucosinalbin) (Table 1). Of these, 17 glucosinolates
with available standards were absolutely quantified in the 12 vegetables
examined and 5 glucosinolates without available standards were semiquantified.
In this study, the five glucosinolates without available standards
were tentatively identified on the basis of the specific MSn patterns of glucosinolates (Supporting Information Table S1). Briefly, glucosinolates can produce
specific MS2 fragmentations at m/z 195, 241, 259, and 275, and furthermore, the most abundant
MS2 fragmentation of m/z 259 gives rise to MS3 fragmentations at m/z 139 and 97.18 Two
isomers, neoglucobrassicin and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, which exhibit
identical molecular masses, were differentiated by comparison with
reported MS2 fragmentation ions ratio and elution sequence
during reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.19 The concentrations of glucosinolates were determined
from the experimental peak area by analytical extrapolation in a standard
calibration curve, and expressed as μg/g of dry weight. In the
semiquantified analysis, glucoraphasatin and glucosativin were quantified
as glucoerucin equivalents, gluconapoleiferin was quantified as glucobrassicanapin
equivalent, and neoglucobrassicin and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin were
quantified as glucobrassicin equivalents (Table 1).

Different Glucosinolates among 12 Brassicaceae Vegetables
The expression of 22 glucosinolates
in the 12 Brassicaceae vegetables is shown in Figure 3 and Supporting Information Table S2. As shown in Figure 3, we found that the concentration and composition
of
glucosinolates varied significantly among 12 vegetables. Of the 12
vegetables examined, cabbage had the highest level of total glucosinolates
(in μg/g dry weight: 19 551.2 ± 1317.7), while Kai
Lan had the lowest level of total glucosinolates (in μg/g dry
weight: 7611.3 ± 868.4) (Supporting Information Table S2). This agrees with the concentrations of total glucosinolates
in previous reports.14,20,21 Moreover, we noted that aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates were
the major components in the 12 vegetables representing 76–100%
of total glucosinolates, except watercress (37%) (Figure 1). Specifically, aliphatic
glucosinolates constituted 61% of total glucosinolates in rocket salad.
The indolic glucosinolates accounted for the major components in Brassica vegetables, including pak choi, choy sum, Chinese
cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli, ranging
from 54 to 82%. For daikon radish and red cherry radish, subspecies
of R. sativus, the contents of aliphatic
and indole glucosinolates were almost equal (40–59%). These
results are in accordance with a recent finding that aliphatic and
indolic glucosinolates are the major components in Brassicaceae vegetables,1 although our study investigated
a more comprehensive range of Brassicaceae vegetables
and a wider range of glucosinolates.

GBB, glucobarbarin; and GSB, glucosinalbin.

As shown in the more detailed data in Supporting Information Table S2, glucoraphanin, gluconapin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin,
4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, and gluconasturtiin were the 5 most common
glucosinolates found in all 12 vegetables. Sinigrin and glucoiberin
were the most predominant glucosinolates in Kai Lan, Brussels sprouts,
cabbage, and cauliflower, whereas glucobrassicanapin and glucoalyssin
were the most predominant glucosinolates in choy sum, pak choi, and
Chinese cabbage. It was also noted that glucocheirolin was detected
only in cabbage and Kai Lan. Glucoerucin was a major glucosinolate
in rocket salad but was also detected in white radish, red cherry
radish, cabbage, and cauliflower. The highest concentration of glucoraphenin
and glucoraphasatin was observed in white radish and red cherry radish,
whereas notably glucoraphenin was found only in white radish and red
cherry radish. The concentrations of glucosativin, glucoerucin, glucoraphanin,
glucobarbarin, and glucosinalbin were detected in relatively higher
quantities in rocket salad as compared to those in other vegetables.
Furthermore, glucosinalbin was present only in rocket salad. In contrast
to other Brassicaceae vegetables, gluconasturtiin
was the predominant glucosinolate in watercress. In brief, the major
profiles of the 22 glucosinolates quantified in the 12 vegetables
were consistent with previous studies that focused on these vegetables.14,20,22

In addition to dry weight,
we also determined fresh weight concentrations
of glucosinolates in μg/g (Supporting Information Table S3). As noted, dry and fresh weights of
glucosinolates showed similar glucosinolate patterns in the 12 vegetables.

Chemotaxonomic Classification
The botanical taxonomic
status of the family Brassicaceae is quite complex
as different concepts for the classification and status of the Brassicaceae species and subspecies exist.23 With the development of DNA sequencing methods, biological
systematic analysis has increasingly been based on DNA sequence analysis.24 In addition to genetic taxonomy, phytochemical
taxonomy has been shown to be able to provide supplementary information
in species identification in the last decade.25 Following a previously reported protocol,26 we investigated the potential use of glucosinolate profiles as reference
markers for chemotaxonomic classification of the 12 Brassicaceae vegetables using both hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal
component analysis (PCA). HCA dendrogram showed the division of the
12 vegetables into 4 major branches on the basis of the average concentrations
of glucosinolates in each individual vegetable (Figure 4a). Vegetables in branch I belong to the Brassica genus and were further divided into two species, B. rapa and B. oleracea. As shown here, the results of glucosinolate-based chemotaxonomic
classification were closely aligned with the morphology-based classification.
To further explore the relationship among the 12 vegetables across
3 different batches, PCA, an unsupervised pattern recognition method,
was performed using the same data. A two-dimensional PCA score plot
was utilized to depict the general variation of glucosinolate profiles
among the 36 samples (12 vegetables × 3 batches). As shown in Figure 4b, the samples were primarily divided into four clusters according
to their species. The clustering pattern is consistent with the classification
from the HCA tree. These findings demonstrate that glucosinolate-based
chemotaxonomic classification can be used to distinguish different Brassicaceae species.

analysis. (b) Principal component analysis.

In summary, in this study, we established a new, reliable,
and
precise analytical method for the quantitative analysis of glucosinolates
using HILIC–MS/MS, and described the accumulation patterns
of 22 glucosinolates in 12 Brassicaceae vegetables.
Significant variations in the concentrations and compositions of glucosinolates
were observed among different Brassicaceae vegetables.
On the basis of the content of 22 glucosinolates, the 12 vegetables
can be divided into 4 clusters, which is consistent with morphological
taxonomy. The findings demonstrate that phytochemical taxonomy has
the potential to be used for distinguishing among Brassicaceae species by identifying variants of chemotaxonomic markers like glucosinolates.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
Acetonitrile,
methanol, formic
acid, and ammonium formate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). The 10 glucosinolate standards including glucocheirolin,
progoitrin, glucoraphenin, epiprogoitrin, glucobrassicanapin, glucoalyssin,
glucobrassicin, gluconasturtiin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, and glucobarbarin
were purchased from Cfm Oskar Tropitzsch GmbH (Marktredwitz, Germany).
Another seven glucosinolate standards including sinigrin, glucoiberin,
glucotropaeolin, glucoraphanin, gluconapin, glucoerucin, and glucosinalbin
were purchased from ChromaDex (Santa Ana, CA). Distilled water was
purified “in-house” using a Milli-Q purification system
(Bedford, MA).

Sample Collection and Preparation
On the basis of earlier
studies in Singapore27,28 and vegetable-consumption patterns
in the Asian region, 12 commonly consumed Brassicaceae vegetables, including B. rapa subsp. chinensis (pak choi), B. rapa var. parachinensis (choy sum), B.
rapa subsp. pekinensis (Chinese cabbage), B. oleracea var. botrytis (cauliflower), B. oleracea var. capitata (cabbage), Brassica olearacea var. italica (broccoli), Brassica olearacea var. alboglabra (Kai Lan), B. oleracea var. gemmifera (Brussels sprouts), E. sativa (rocket salad), R. sativus (daikon
radish), Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus (red cherry radish), and N. officinale (watercress), were included in this study (Figure 1). Three batches of these 12 vegetables were
purchased from three local supermarkets in Singapore. The fresh vegetables
(whole tissue) were washed using tap water and then snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried vegetables were
ground into a fine powder and stored at −80 °C before
analysis. For glucosinolates extraction, 100 mg of freeze-dried samples
was treated with 1 mL of 70% methanol (v/v) containing 150 ng/mL of
internal standard (glucosinalbin or glucoraphenin) and incubated at
70 °C for 10 min. After being cooled in an ice bath, the extracts
were centrifuged at 15 000g for 15 min, and
the supernatants were collected. The extraction procedure was repeated
twice with 70% methanol (v/v) to give a final extract containing 50
ng/mL of internal standard. The supernatants were then combined and
evaporated until dry at 40 °C. The dried samples were reconstituted
in 3 mL of 70% acetonitrile (v/v) and filtered through a 0.22 μm
nylon filter for analysis. Samples were extracted and analyzed in
triplicates, and data were represented as mean ± SD (n = 3).

Glucosinolate Profiling and Identification
Agilent
1290 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography system (Waldbronn,
Germany) coupled to a 6540 quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-ToF) mass
detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with an electrospray
ionization source was used for glucosinolate profiling and identification.
The separation of glucosinolates was achieved on a Waters ACQUITY
UPLC BEH HILIC column (2.1 × 100 mm2, 1.7 μm).
The mobile phase consisted of A (30% acetonitrile containing 10 mM
ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid) and B (95% acetonitrile containing
10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid). The linear gradient was
as follows: 0–1 min, 100–100% B; 1–5 min, 100–95%
B; 5–8 min, 95–80% B; 8–12 min, 80–15%
B at a column temperature of 35 °C with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min.
The autosampler was cooled at 4 °C, and 5 μL of the extract
was injected. Electrospray ionization was performed in negative ion
mode with the following source parameters: drying gas (N2) temperature 200 °C with a flow rate of 14 L/min, nebulizer
gas pressure 30 psi, sheath gas temperature 400 °C with a flow
rate of 11 L/min, capillary voltage 3000 V, and nozzle voltage 800
V. The MS/MS analysis was carried out to study the structures of glucosinolates.
Moreover, the commercial standards were analyzed to support the identification
of glucosinolates.

Glucosinolate Quantification
Quantitative
analysis
of glucosinolates was performed on an Agilent 1290 ultra-high-performance
liquid chromatography system (Waldbronn, Germany) coupled to a 6490
Triple Quadrupole (QQQ) mass detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) equipped
with iFunnel Technology and an electrospray ionization source. Separation
of glucosinolates was achieved using the same method as in Q-ToF analysis.
Mass spectra were recorded in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
mode. Data acquisition and processing were performed using MassHunter
software version B.05.00 (Agilent Technologies, CA).

Method Validation
The proposed quantitative method
was validated for its limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification
(LOQ), linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery, according to
Food and Drug Administration guidelines for biological methods as
in our previously published report.29 Briefly,
accurately weighed standards were dissolved in 70% acetonitrile separately
and diluted to provide a series of standard solutions with gradient
concentration to make the calibration curves. All of the solutions
were stored at −20 °C. Method precision was studied by
injecting the same mixed sample solution six times consecutively,
both on the same day for intraday variation and on three consecutive
days for interday variation. To check the reproducibility, six independently
prepared samples from the mixed vegetable powder were analyzed. The
recoveries were evaluated by spiking three defined amounts of glucosinolate
standards (approximately equivalent to 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 times the
concentration of the matrix) into the mixed vegetable sample in triplicates
and were extracted and quantified as described earlier.

Statistical
Analysis
Independent measurements in triplicates
were used for each sample in all statistical analyses. Values below
the LOD were assigned as a proxy value of an LOD/2 as usual.30 The data were diagnosed in histogram plots to
be skewed and were therefore transformed into log 2-scale to
meet the assumption of normality before statistical analysis. The
differences in glucosinolate concentrations among the 12 vegetables
were examined using one-way analysis of variance. Both hierarchical
cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were
applied to identify similarities of glucosinolate profiles in 12 examined
vegetables. In HCA, the between-groups linkage method as the amalgamation
rule and the squared Euclidean distance as the metric were applied
to establish clusters. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics 24 and SIMCA 14. A two-sided p <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
