Saponins are potential
wide-spectrum antitumor drugs, and copper(I)
catalyzed azide–alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is a suitable
approach to synthesizing saponin-like compounds by regioselective
glycosylation of the C2/C3 hydroxyl and C28 carboxylic groups of triterpene
aglycones maslinic acid (MA) and oleanolic acid (OA). Biological studies
on the T-84 human colon carcinoma cell line support the role of the
hydroxyl groups at C2/C3, the influence of the aglycone, and the bulky
nature of the substituents in C28. OA bearing a α-d-mannose moiety at C28 (compound 18) focused our interest
because the estimated inhibitory concentration 50 was similar to that
reported for ginsenoside Rh2 against colon cancer cells and it inhibits
the G1–S phase transition affecting the cell viability
and apoptosis. Considering that triterpenoids from natural sources
have been identified as inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
of activated B cell (NF-κB) signaling, docking studies were
conducted to evaluate whether NF-κB may be a potential target.
Results are consistent with the biological study and predict a similar
binding mode of MA and compound 18 to the p52 subunit
from NF-κB but not for OA. The fact that the binding site is
shared by the NF-κB inhibitor 6,6-dimethyl-2-(phenylimino)-6,7-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxathiol-4(5H)-one supports the
result and points to NF-κB as a potential target of both MA
and compound 18.

Introduction
Cancer
is the second cause of death and morbidity in developed
countries. According to the World Health Organization, about 8.8 million
people worldwide died from cancer in 2015, which represents nearly
one in six of all global death and an estimated economic cost of $1.16
trillion.1 Distribution of cancer is associated
with socioeconomic development, the countries with a high human development
index (HDI) being responsible for 41% of the cases, whereas low-HDI
countries for only less than 6%. Despite this fact, the transition
of low-income countries to higher development will have profound effects
on the scale and profile of the cancer.2 Among the different cancers, colorectal cancer shows a strong correlation
with lifestyle, and it can be considered as a marker of developmental
transition and adoption of a western lifestyle.2,3 This
is one of the three most common cancers expected in United States
and is rising rapidly in low-income and middle-income countries.3,4

Saponins are secondary metabolites that are gaining increasing
attention as potential wide-spectrum antitumor drugs because apart
from provoking membrane permeabilization when administrated at high
concentrations, at low concentrations, they show cytostatic, proapoptotic,
and antimetastatic effects on tumor cells.5,6 From
a chemical point of view, saponins consist of a nonpolar polycyclic
part, referred to as aglycone or sapogenin, attached to one or more
sugar side chains (i.e., glycone). On the basis of the chemical character
of the aglycone and the number of directly bound sugar chains, saponins
are divided into steroidal and triterpenoid saponins and categorized
into monodesmosides (one chain), bisdesmosides (two chains), or trisdesmosides
(three chains). Naturally occurring triterpenoid saponins mainly contain
aglycones with 30 carbon atoms, the most commonly core structures
being pentacyclic oleananes and tetracyclic dammaranes, and their
antitumor activity has been proven.6,7 The degree
of structural diversity and the fact that minor structural changes
in the molecules may lead to a major difference in activity make the
prediction of the biological activity from the structure–activity
relationship a real challenge. Additionally, the isolation of saponins
from plant material is difficult and time-consuming and the synthesis
on industrial scale is far from trivial.8 In this context, β-hederin (oleanolic acid 3-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-α-l-arabinopyranoside) has been a source of inspiration to synthesize
different families of new active compounds.9,10

Interestingly, pentacyclic triterpenes present in the skin of the
fruit of Olea europaea have been proposed
to have a positive effect on colon tumors and, among them, maslinic
acid (2α,3β-dihydroxyolean-12-ene-28-oic) (MA) and oleanolic
acid (3β-hydroxyolean-12-ene-28-oic) (OA) stand out.11−15 The bioactivity of these triterpenes is not limited to antitumor
activity but includes cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative,
antileukemic, antithrombotic, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antihyperlipidemic,
immunomodulating, antiviral, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal activities.16−18 The low toxicity and the broad bioactivity spectrum of MA and OA
make them attractive compounds for chemical modifications to improve
the potency, selectivity, and/or pharmacokinetic parameters.18 Thus, OA and, to a lesser extent, MA have been
modified in three “active portions”: the hydroxyl groups
at C2 and/or C3, the C12–C13 double bond, and the C28 carboxylic
group, many of the resulting molecules showing improved antitumor
activity.19−25 However, the poor water solubility of triterpenoids is a key factor
that limits their clinical application as therapeutic agents and PEGylation
and glycosylation have been demonstrated to be successful strategies
that improve water solubility and preserve the biological activity.26−28

Pentacyclic triterpenes and triterponoid saponins probably
act
at multiple levels although the target molecules are still being identified.
Cumulative experimental and epidemiologic lines of evidence suggest
a link between inflammation and cancer, and recent studies have demonstrated
the relevance of chronic inflammation in colorectal cancer development.29 Of particular importance is the function of
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Among them, the tumor necrosis
factor activates nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
B cell (NF-κB), inducing the expression of various genes that
stimulate tumor-associated inflammation, including cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2).29 In this context, the fact that
triterpenoids from natural sources such as ginsenosides, glycyrrhizin,
betulin, lupeol, and avicins have been identified as inhibitors of
NF-κB signaling may be one of the keys to understand their effect
at cellular level.30 This observation is
especially relevant when taking into account that aberrant NF-κB
regulation has been observed in many cancers, including colon, lung,
breast, and prostate, that are the main contributors to the statistics
of cancer worldwide, and the inhibition of NF-κB has been identified
as a promising option to improve anticancer therapy.31−33

Herein, we describe the glycosylation of the triterpenes from
olive
fruit MA and OA by means of click chemistry to yield a short library
of synthetic mono- and bidesmosides and their evaluation against the T-84 cell line (human colorectal
carcinoma derived from lung metastasis) and docking with NF-κB.

Results
and Discussion
Chemistry
The cytostatic, proapoptotic,
and antimetastatic
effects of saponins on tumor cells make them potential wide-spectrum
anticancer drugs.5,6 However, the degree of structural
diversity and the fact that minor structural changes in the molecules
may lead to major differences in the activity are obstacles for the
systematic study of saponins. Because the pentacyclic triterpenes
MA and OA have been proposed to have a positive effect on colon tumors
and click chemistry is a very powerful tool in drug discovery, we
envisaged the glycosylation of MA and OA via the copper(I)-catalyzed
azide–alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) as a feasible
approach to synthesizing synthetic oleanane-type triterpenoids that
may be biologically active.11−15,34,35 The rationale behind this strategy is that besides the general benefits
of click chemistry the 1,2,3-triazole formed in CuAAC is more than
a passive linker because it can form π–π interactions
with aromatic rings and hydrogen bonds through the N(2) and N(3) nitrogen
atoms, contributing to the interaction with the target molecule.34,35

Our efforts were focused on the derivatization of the C2/C3
hydroxyl groups and the C28 carboxylic group, which according to the
literature are “active portions” of the molecule.19 β-d-Lactose (Lac), α-d-mannose (Man), and β-d-glucose (Glc) were linked
to aglycones MA and OA to obtain both monodesmoside- and bidesmoside-like
saponins. Commercial MA (1) and OA (2) were
chemoselectively propargylated in dimethylformamide (DMF)/K2CO3 at room temperature for 40 h to yield the corresponding
esters 3 and 4 (Scheme 1). When the propargylation of MA was carried
out in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/NaOH, bispropargylated compound 5 was obtained, as expected from the reported low reactivity
of the OH group at C3.19 Alternatively,
an azide group was introduced at these positions by acylation with
chloroacetic anhydride, followed by nucleophilic displacement of the
chlorine atom by azide to yield compounds 6 and 7 (Scheme 1). The counterparts clickable azide (8–11) and alkyne (12–14) sugars
derived from monosaccharides Man and Glc, disaccharide Lac, and trivalent
mannosylated dendron (Scheme 2) were synthesized following methodologies previously reported.36,37 Click assembly of complementary clickable triterperne (3–7) and sugar (8–14) partners was carried out in DMF using copper complex (EtO)3P·CuI as a soluble catalyst and under microwave irradiation
(800 W, 80 °C, 15 min) to improve the yield and reduce the reaction
time.20,38 Saponin-like compounds 15–29 were thus obtained with good yield (Scheme 3), and their structure was confirmed by NMR
(Figures S4–S20). This short library
comprises monodesmoside- and bidesmoside-like saponins with subtle
differences derived from the aglycone (i.e., MA vs OA) as the pairs 15–18, 16–19, or 17–20 as well as others more
divergent consequence of the increasing complexity of the glycone
(monosaccharide, disaccharide, or trivalent dendron), its number (monodesmoside
vs bisdesmoside), and its position (ring A vs C28) (Scheme 3).

In

activities on the human colon carcinoma T-84 cell line expressed as
the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values resulting
from the mean ± standard deviation of at least five independent
measurements in the micromolar range.

Biological
Assays
Saponins commonly found in herbs
and in formulations traditionally used in Chinese medicine have been
reported to exhibit promising anticancer potential.39 Among them, the triterpenoid saponins ginsenoside Rh2 and
Rg3 and saikosaponin A show in vitro antiproliferative activity against
colon cancer cells with the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) ranging from 100 to 20 μM.39 This
fact led us to assay compounds 1 (MA), 2 (OA), and 15–29 on the T-84 cell
line, a human colon carcinoma cell line derived from a lung metastasis
of colorectal carcinoma. Their antiproliferative activity was evaluated
by colorimetric quantification with sulforhodamine B.40,41 Results are included in Scheme 3. According to IC50, compounds can be grouped
into three categories: (i) those with an attractive IC50, including MA and compound 18 with values of 50.2 ±
0.9 and 45.06 ± 0.6 μM, respectively, (ii) those with IC50 within the interval 60–90 μM, OA being at the
border with IC50 89.4 ± 3.4 μM, and (iii) those
with IC50 > 90 μM and considered as inactive.
This
different behavior of MA and OA has been reported in the literature
for cancer cell lines EMT-6 (breast) and SW480 (colon), and this has
been explained by the additional α-oriented hydroxyl group at
C2 in MA (Scheme 3).22 The analysis of the synthetic oleanane-type
triterpenoids revels that the modification of both hydroxyl groups
of MA yielded compounds 27–29 with
low antiproliferative activity, which is in the same order as that
of compounds 24–26 obtained from
the poorly active OA aglycone. These results support the role of the
hydroxyl group at C2 of MA and suggest that the modification of the
hydroxyl group at C3 confers some antiproliferative activity to those
compounds derived from OA (compounds 24–26) and partially compensates the effect of the substitution
at C2 of MA (compounds 27–29).

The C28 carboxyl group has been identified as one of the “active
portions” of the molecule, and amide derivatization at C28
of β-hederin, a triterpenoid saponin whose aglycone is OA, results
in highly cytotoxic compounds.9,19 Hence, the modification
of C28 was envisaged as a synthetic approach to converting MA and
OA into more toxic synthetic oleanane-type triterpenoids. Compounds 15–20 were synthesized, and their biological
activity was found to be dependent on both the aglycone and the bulky
nature of the substituent (Scheme 3). Thus, compounds 15–16 derived from MA are inactive, whereas their counterparts 18–19 from OA are active, with IC50 of
45.6 and 65.3 μM, respectively. The steric effect of the substituents
is revealed by compounds 18–20 whose
biological activity ranges from 45.6 μM for compound 18, with a single Man residue linked by the anomeric position, to the
inactive compound 20, bearing a trivalent dendron. In
addition, compound 19, with a Glc residue linked by C6
to test a different orientation of the glycopyranoside ring, is less
active than compound 18. These results suggest that the
modification of C28 disturbs the interaction of MA with its target,
whereas it confers antiproliferative activity to OA by promoting either
the interaction with different targets or an alternative interaction
with the same target as MA.

Compound 18 is more
active than MA despite being derived
from OA, in agreement with other authors who reported similar results
for the PEGylated OA and MA.26,27 This fact attracted
our interest, and further biological studies were carried out. Thus,
to evaluate the effect of oxidative stress on the biological effect
of compound 18, the survival rate of T-84 cells in the
presence or absence of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) was determined by the sulforhodamine B colorimetric
assay.42 NAC is an antioxidant frequently
used as a tool for investigating the role of the reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in biological processes.43,44 As shown in Figure 1, NAC does not confer
protection to T-84 carcinoma cells lines treated either with compound 18, MA, or OA, discarding the oxidative stress as the main reason responsible for the biological
action.

Figure 1 Effect of NAC on the survival of the human colon carcinoma T-84
cell line. Cells were treated with either compound 18, OA, or MA alone (−) or in combination with 2 mM NAC (+).
Values are normalized by their control counterparts. Symbols * and
** denote a significant difference with control (−) or control
(+) groups, respectively, p < 0.05.

This result was expected because according to bibliography
MA exerts
a dual activity acting as a copper chelator and a scavenger of free
radicals, whereas in vitro studies with several breast cell lines
have shown the protective effect of OA on MCF10A cells (nontumoral
cell line) by reducing the ROS levels in the basal state.45−48 In contrast to our results, it has been reported that NAC reverses
the inhibitory effect of OA in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but
this discrepancy can be rationalized when considering that the authors
of the study concluded that OA triggered a new autophagic cell death
pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.49

Because the cell cycle machinery is one of the most
important chemotherapeutic
targets, we evaluated the cell cycle distribution of T-84 cells by
flow cytometry after 24 h of induction with three different concentrations
(0.5, 1, or 2 times the corresponding IC50 value) of compounds 18, MA, or OA.50,51 Results are depicted in Table 1, and the representative
flow cytograms are included in the Supporting Information as Figure S1.

The percentages
of control cells (i.e., untreated) after 24 h were
2.2% in sub-G1, 46.1% in G0–G1, 19.9%
in S, and 31.8% in G2–M. In general, the three compounds
assayed provoked an effect on the cell cycle distribution in a dose-dependent
manner to yield an increase in the sub-G1 phase and a decrease
in S and G2–M phases, although each compound showed
particular features. When cells were treated with compound 18 at a concentration of 0.5 × IC50, the cell cycle
distribution remained as that of the control cells and concentrations
of 1 × IC50 and 2 × IC50 provoked
a similar effect, yielding an increase in G0–G1 (67%) and a decrease in S and G2–M phases
(around 4–5 and 23%, respectively), without important changes
in the sub-G1 population. MA
led to appreciable changes in the cell cycle even at 0.5 × IC50, with a dose-dependent G0–G1 accumulation (61.8 and 73.6%, respectively) and a reduction in the
percentage of cells in the two other phases. The treatment with MA
at 2 × IC50 yielded an increase of sub-G1 (12.6%) and G0–G1 (55.4%) and a reduction
in S and G2–M phases, in agreement with the data
reported for HT-29 and Caco-2 colorectal cells.12−14,52,53 Analogous to MA, OA
induction also provoked changes in the cell cycle at 0.5 × IC50, but unlike MA, the main feature of the cell cycle was the
marked dose-dependent increment of sub-G1, from 3.1% (0.5×)
to 45.8% (2×) accompanied by an initial increment in G0–G1 at 0.5× that lowered to reach at 2×
the values of the control cell and an overall reduction of S and G2–M phases.

These results show that MA, OA, and
compound 18 are
able to inhibit G1–S phase transition. However,
although the three compounds increased the sub-G1 fraction
at 24 h, the values induced by OA are especially significant and in
agreement with the reported induction of apoptosis and inhibition
of cell proliferation.54 Interestingly,
whereas OA induces a large extent of apoptosis at a concentration
2 × IC50, the cell-cycle profile of the cells treated
with compound 18 remains almost invariant. To confirm
whether the fraction of sub-G1 cells was due to apoptosis
promotion, the viability of cells induced for 48 h with different
concentrations of 18, MA, and OA was evaluated by flow
cytometry with annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
and propidium iodide (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Effects of compound 18, MA, and OA on the viability
of T-84 cells induced with 0.5, 1, or 2 times the IC50 value
for 48 h. Percentages of viable cells (VI), necrotic cells (NE), early
apoptotic cells (EA-AP), late apoptotic cells (LA-AP), and total apoptotic
cells (total-AP) are shown. The experiment was repeated independently
three times yielding similar results. Symbol * denotes p < 0.05 vs
control cells (i.e., untreated).

The treatment with compound 18 reduced the cell
viability
from 92.9% for the control group to 64.9 and 60.63% for the cultures
treated with 1 and 2 times the IC50, respectively. This
reduction of the viability was associated with an increase in the
fraction of cells in necrosis, early apoptosis, and late apoptosis,
the total apoptosis being increased from 3.8% for the control group
to 25.2 and 27.1% for the cultures treated with 1 and 2 times the
IC50, respectively, revealing that both cell viability
and apoptosis remain almost unaffected when the dose of compound 18 is doubled. However, cultures treated with MA or OA experienced
a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability, concomitant with an
increment of total apoptosis that was more accentuated with MA. MA
induced 48.6 and 75% of total apoptosis at 1× and 2×, respectively,
whereas OA induced 27.3 and 40.2%, respectively. These results are
in agreement with the studies that demonstrate that MA and OA, either
alone or in combination with MA, inhibit cell proliferation, causing
apoptotic death in HT-29 cells and that OA does not lead to apoptosis
in other cell lines, such as the colon carcinoma HCT-15, despite the
success of 3-O-acetyloleanolic acid on HCT-116.11,12,54−58

Docking Studies
Recent studies have
demonstrated the
importance of chronic inflammation in colorectal cancer development.
Although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood, NF-κB
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) have been identified as potential therapeutic
targets.29−33,59 Triterpenoids from natural sources
such as ginsenosides, glycyrrhizin, betulin, lupeol, and avicins have
been identified as inhibitors of NF-κB signaling, and this may
be one of the keys to understand their effect at cellular level.30 Additionally, MA has been reported to suppress
COX-2 expression at concentrations that also lower the activity of
NF-κB, suggesting that the effect on NF-κB may lead to
the downregulation of different genes, including COX-2.60,61 In this context, we hypothesized that the biological effect of MA
and compound 18 might be a consequence of the interaction
with NF-κB and envisaged docking as the approach to put to test
the hypothesis.

The docking approach is not exempt of difficulty
because, despite the fact that the output results are ranked by a
scoring function, the identification of the correct solution may be
far from trivial, and for this reason, it is customary to assess the
goodness of the scoring function by redocking ligands that have been
cocrystallized with the target.62 However,
to the best of our knowledge, no structure of NF-κB bound to
molecules similar to MA has been reported and an additional difficulty
is the fact that NF-κB is a family of homo- and heterodimeric
proteins resulting from the association of five different subunits
(p50/p105 (NF-κB1), p52/p100 (NF-κB2), RelA (p65), c-Rel
(v-Rel being the viral oncogenic version), and RelB), the two main
NF-κB dimers being p50:RelA and p52:RelB heterodimers.63 Hence, as a preliminary step, the binding of
MA and OA to the entire surface of p50:RelA (protein data bank (PDB)
code 1vkx) and
p52:v-Rel (PDB code 3do7) was computed. Calculations did not reach any solution for p50:RelA,
and the scoring function of the docking of MA and OA on p52:v-Rel
revealed two significant solutions for MA and one for OA (Table 2).

The graphical analysis of the solutions revealed that MA is predicted
to bind both p52 and v-Rel, the former being the best solution, whereas
OA shares the binding mode of MA with subunit v-Rel (Figure S2). The fact that only the experimental antiproliferative
activity of MA was significant led us to hypothesize that binding
to v-Rel was not biologically relevant. This hypothesis was put to
test by docking 6,6-dimethyl-2-(phenylimino)-6,7-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxathiol-4(5H)-one (BOT), a newly
discovered NF-κB inhibitor with antiproliferative effect.64 The solution with the highest score predicted
the binding of BOT to p52 in the same site as MA, supporting the hypothesis
that the binding to p52 is biologically relevant (Figure S3).

The docking of compound 18 to
the entire surface of
p52:v-Rel also predicted the binding to p52, at the same site as MA
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 Left: poses

(PDB accession code 3do7). Subunit v-Rel is shown in green, subunit
p52 in purple, and DNA in yellow. Right: alignment of the top score

is shown as a surface colored according to the hydrophobicity on the
Kyte–Doolittle scale, ranging from dodger blue, for the most
hydrophilic, to white and orange red, for the most hydrophobic.

The analysis of the interactions
(Table 3) reveals that
MA and compound 18 share the hydrophobic interactions
of the triterpenic aglycone with
Lys119 and Gln157 and the salt bridge between the carboxyl group at
C28 and an Arg residue. Compound 18 also forms three
additional hydrogen bonds, one between the hydroxyl groups in position 3 of the
mannose ring and two between nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring and
Lys153, suggesting that not only the carbohydrate but also the triazole
linker plays a role in the interaction.

Table 3 Analysis
of the Interactions between
p52 and MA and Compound 18a
a HB = hydrogen bond, HI = hydrophobic
interaction, SB = salt bridge.

The Kd of the interaction was estimated
from the computed values of ΔG (Table 2). Although these estimated
values may differ considerably from the experimental dissociation
constants, they make the evaluation of the relative affinity possible.
The docking results of MA predict a lower affinity for v-Rel than
for p52, and this low affinity is shared by OA, being consistent with
the poor antiproliferative activity of OA. Interestingly, the Kd values predicted for MA and compound 18 are 0.34 and 0.08 μM, respectively, suggesting that
compound 18 is more related to MA than to OA, as supported
by the cytometric study.

Conclusions
CuAAC is a suitable approach for the regioselective
modification
of the C2/C3 hydroxyl and C28 carboxylic groups of the triterpene
aglycones MA and OA to yield a short library of saponin-like compounds.
The cytotoxicity assays reveal different behaviors of OA and MA and
suggest that the modification of the hydroxyl group at C3 of these
compounds confers some antiproliferative activity to the compounds
derived from OA. The cytotoxicity of the compounds resulting from
the click modification of the C28 carboxyl group is dependent on the
aglycone and on the bulky nature of the substituent, those derived
from OA that link a monosaccharide (Man or Glc) being active. In particular,
OA bearing a Man moiety at C28 (compound 18) is the most
cytotoxic on the human colon carcinoma T-84 cells, and it may have
potential pharmacological interest, with IC50 in the range
of that reported for ginsenoside Rh2. Biological assays show that
although compound 18 is derived from the poorly active
OA aglycone, it shares with MA the effect on the cell cycle, inhibiting
DNA replication and G1–S phase transition, and unlike
OA, it does not promote apoptosis to a large extent. Docking experiments
suggest that the biological activity may be related to the binding
to NF-κB. Both MA and compound 18 share with BOT
the binding mode to the p52 subunit of NF-κB, and the predicted
affinities are in agreement with the experimental IC50 values.

Experimental
Section
General Chemistry Methods
All reagents and solvents
were used as obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise indicated.
All microwave reactions were performed in a Milestone Star Microwave
Labstation at 500 W. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed
on Merck Silica Gel 60 F254 aluminum sheets, and TLC plates were stained
with ceric sulfate (1% w/v) and ammonium sulfate (2.5% w/v) in 10%
(v/v) aqueous sulfuric acid or ethanolic sulfuric acid (10% v/v). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature
on a Varian Direct Drive (400 or 500 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts
are given in ppm and referenced to the signal of the residual protonated
solvent (1H: δ = 2.50 for DMSO-d6, 13C: δ = 39.10 for DMSO-d6). Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were recorded
with a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. Melting points were measured
with a Gallenkamp melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Optical
rotations were recorded on a PerkinElmer 341 polarimeter at room temperature.
IR spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer spectrum two Fourier transform
infrared attenuated total reflection spectrometer.

Synthetic Procedures
General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Mono Alkynyl Derivatives
of MA and OA (3 and 4)
To a solution
of MA or OA (96%, 1 mmol) in DMF (20 mL) was added propargyl bromide
(80 wt % toluene, 9.3 mmol) and potassium carbonate (2.5 mmol). The
obtained suspension was stirred at room temperature for 40 h, and
the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in
CH2Cl2 (30 mL) and washed successively with
H2O, 5% HCl solution, and H2O. The organic layer
was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered,
and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude was
purified by column chromatography.

Compound 3
Column chromatography (CH2Cl2/MeOH,
20:1) yields 3 as a white
solid (327 mg, 75%). The spectroscopic data match those reported in
the literature.20

Compound 4

Synthesis
of Dialkynyl Derivative of MA (5)
To a solution
of MA (96%, 825 mg, 1.68 mmol) in DMSO (8 mL) was added
propargyl bromide (80 wt % toluene, 37.2 mmol) and NaOH (40% solution,
8 mL). The obtained suspension was stirred at room temperature for
40 h. The resulting mixture was diluted with Et2O/toluene
1:1 (50 mL) and washed with H2O (3 × 25 mL). The organic
layer was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered,
and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude was
purified by column chromatography (Et2O/hexane, 1:2), yielding 5 as a white solid (350 mg, 70%). The spectroscopic data match

Bioassays
Cell
Lines and Culture
Human colorectal carcinoma line
T-84 was supplied by the Department of Cell Cultures of the Granada
University Scientific Instrumentation Centre. This line was cultured
at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity with Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 10 mL/L penicillin–streptomycin 100×,
and 2 mM l-glutamine. Culture media and respective supplements
were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain).

In Vitro
Antiproliferative Assay
To calculate the IC50 values
of the compounds, T-84 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates, and after 24 h, they were induced with increasing concentrations
of one of the compounds from 15 to 29 for
3 days. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 10% cold trichloroacetic
acid (4 °C) and stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B in 1% HOAc.
The colorant was solubilized with 10 mM Tris-base, pH 10.5, and optical
density values were determined by colorimetry at 492 nm (Multiskan
EX, Thermo Electron Corporation). IC50 values were calculated
from the semilogarithmic dose–response curve by linear interpolation.
For the study of the induction of oxidative stress, cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of compounds 18, MA, and
OA in the presence or absence of 2 mM NAC for 3 days. Then, the cultures
were processed for colorimetric quantification by the sulforhodamine
B assay, as described above.

Cell Cycle Analysis
T-84 cells were seeded in six-well
plates, and after 24 h, they were induced with 0.5, 1, or 2 times
the IC50 value of 18, MA, or OA for 24 h.
Then, cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed
with 70% cold ethanol, and incubated with a DNA extraction solution
(0.2 M Na2HPO4, 0.1 M citric acid, pH 7.8) for
15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then centrifuged, washed with PBS,
and resuspended in 250 μL of a solution of propidium iodide
(40 μg/mL) and RNAse (100 μg/mL) for 30 min at 37 °C
in the dark. Finally, samples were analyzed in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).
Results were analyzed using FlowJo software (v 7.6.5, Tree Star, Inc.).

Apoptosis Assays with Annexin V
Cell viability was
determined by flow cytometry using the annexin V–FITC kit (Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA). T-84 cells were seeded in six-well plates, and after
24 h, they were induced with 1 or 2 times the IC50 values
of 18, MA, and OA for 48 h. Cells were then detached
with PBS–ethylenediaminetetraacetate, washed twice with cold
PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. Cells were
stained following the manufacturer’s protocol, and then samples
were analyzed in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Results were analyzed
using FlowJo software (v 7.6.5, Tree Star, Inc.).

Statistical
Analysis
SPSS 24 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago,
IL) was used for the statistical analysis. Results were compared with
the Student’s test, one- or two-way analyses of variance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data were graphically
represented using Microsoft Excel 2010 software (Microsoft Corporation).

Docking
Coordinate Preparation
Ghemical 2.95 was used to generate
three-dimensional coordinates of MA, OA, BOT, and compound 18 and for geometrical minimization by molecular mechanics with the
tripos 5.2 force field until the gradient energy was lower than 0.001
kJ/mol.65 The X-ray coordinates of the
NF-κB1 p50:p65 and NF-κB2 p52:v-Rel complexed with DNA
were extracted from the protein data bank (PDB codes 1vkx and 3do7, respectively),
and they were prepared for docking with Dock Prep, a tool implemented
in Chimera, that deletes water molecules and ions, repairs truncated
side chains, adds hydrogens, and assigns partial charges.66

Docking
Docking was carried out
at Swiss-Dock sever
in accurate mode and without defining the region of interest (blind
docking).67 Results were clustered and
ranked by their fullfitness scores, a parameter that accounts for
the total energy of the system calculated with the CHARMM22 molecular
mechanics force field and that includes the solvation free energy.62,68 Analysis of the results was carried out with the help of UCSF Chimera,
Poseview, and protein–ligand interaction profiles.66,69,70Kd values were estimated from the ΔG computed
during the docking by applying the expression ΔG = RT ln Kd, where R is the ideal gas constant (0.0019872 kcal/(mol
K)) and T is the temperature (298 K).
