In
the search of therapeutic agents for emerging drug-resistant
parasites, the synthesis of newer classes of 8-quinolinamines has
emerged as a successful chemotherapeutic approach. We report synthesis
of 8-quinolinamines bearing 5-alkoxy, 4-methyl, and 2-tert-butyl groups in the quinoline framework and their amino acid conjugates
as broad-spectrum anti-infectives. 8-Quinolinamines exhibited potent
in vitro antimalarial activity [IC50 = 20–4760 ng/mL
(drug-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum D6 strain) and IC50 = 22–4760 ng/mL (drug-resistant P. falciparum W2 strain)]. The most promising analogues
have cured all animals at 25 mg/kg/day against drug-sensitive Plasmodium berghei and at 50 mg/kg/day against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis infections in Swiss
mice. The in vitro antileishmanial activities (IC50 = 0.84–5.0
μg/mL and IC90 = 1.95–7.0 μg/mL) comparable
to standard drug pentamidine were exhibited by several of the synthesized
8-quinolinamines. At the same time, very promising antifungal activities
(Candida albicans—IC50 = 4.93–19.38 μg/mL; Candida glabrata—IC50 = 3.96–19.22 μg/mL; Candida krusei—IC50 = 2.89–18.95
μg/mL; Cryptococcus neoformans—IC50 = 0.67–18.64 μg/mL; and Aspergillus fumigatus—IC50 = 6.0–19.32
μg/mL) and antibacterial activities (Staphylococcus
aureus—IC50 = 1.33–18.9 μg/mL;
methicillin-resistant S. aureus—IC50 = 1.38–15.34 μg/mL; and Mycobacterium
intracellulare—IC50 = 3.12–20
μg/mL) were also observed. None of the 8-quinolinamines exhibited
cytotoxicity and therefore are a promising structural class of compounds
as antiparasitic and antimicrobials.

Introduction
Infectious diseases
are a leading cause of death worldwide. Malaria
is one of the most prevalent protozoan parasitic diseases caused by Plasmodium species, particularly Plasmodium
falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale. The disease spreads through vector
female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. A fifth species causing malaria in humans, Plasmodium
knowlesi, has recently emerged. P.
knowlesi is distributed across South-East Asia and
often misdiagnosed by microscopy as P. malariae. P. knowlesi causes a serious form
of malaria, resulting in severe infection with a rate of 6–9%
and a case fatality rate of 3%. Malaria causes considerable morbidity
and mortality and is associated with approximately 800 000
deaths worldwide each year.1 Despite global
effort to control malaria, the disease remains endemic in several
parts of the world. According to the 2017 World Health Organization
report, 212 million new cases of malaria worldwide in 91 countries
have been reported and around 1.2 billion are at high risk. The disease
is highly endemic in the African countries, where it causes significant
mortality among the vulnerable children and pregnant women.2 At the same time, according to the WHO, leishmaniasis,
a parasitic infectious disease, affects every year an estimated 1.3
million people from 98 nationalities, mainly in developing countries
of the tropical and subtropical regions, but also around the Mediterranean
area, including southern Europe.3,4 Leishmaniasis is the
second most lethal parasitic infection with about 30 000 annual
deaths, considering that the number of cases is certainly underevaluated,
as leishmaniasis is a reportable disease in only 33 countries. This
infection is due to a protozoan parasite of the Leishmania genus, transmitted to its mammal hosts (humans, dogs, monkeys, and
rodents) by the bite of an infected Phlebotominae sand fly. Similarly,
increasing numbers of multidrug-resistant microbial pathogens have
become a serious problem, particularly during the last decade and
provide an impetus for the search and discovery of novel antibacterial
and antifungal agents.5 Therefore, an urgent
need for new treatments is necessary because of the spread of drug
resistance to current medications.

In an attempt to develop
compounds that exhibit promising antimalarial,
antileishmanial, and antimicrobial activities, we have previously
observed that 8-quinolinamine is a versatile class of compounds that
exhibit a broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities
such as antimalarial, antileishmanial, and antimicrobial.6−18 We have earlier reported several ring-substituted 8-quinolinamines
possessing remarkable antimalarial activities. For instance, compounds
containing alkoxy groups (OC5H11 and OC8H17) at the C-5 position and the alkyl group (C2H5) at the C-4 position of antimalarial drug primaquine
(PQ) exhibit in vitro and in vivo biological efficacy higher than
chloroquine (CQ) against both CQ-sensitive (CQS) and CQ-resistant
(CQR) strains (IC50 = 9.4 and 9.7 ng/mL, respectively).10 We have also reported synthesis of a series
containing metabolically stable bulky alkyl groups at the C-2 position
of the quinoline ring in PQ. The most promising analogue, 2-tert-butylprimaquine, displayed potent in vitro antimalarial
activity (IC50 = 39 ng/mL), which was superior to that
of CQ (IC50 = 113 ng/mL).11 Similarly,
we have reported antimalarial activities of 4,5-disubsituted-8-quinolinamines
and their amino acid conjugates.10,13,17,18 Trouet et al. have
earlier proposed that linking PQ to small peptides reduces its toxicity
and increases its activity.19 Later, Carroll
et al. have reported peptide derivatives of PQ as potential antimalarials
possessing blood schizontocidal activity against Plasmodium
berghei in mice.20 Upon
the basis of these observations, we synthesized and evaluated amino
acid conjugates of PQ and other ring-substituted 8-quinolinamines.
Several analogues display high in vitro and in vivo antimalarial activity
and in vitro antileishmanial and antimicrobial activities.18 In continuation of our research on the structural
diversification of 8-quinolinamines, herein, we have synthesized hybrid
derivatives in which the quinoline ring is substituted at the C-2
position with a 2-tert-butyl group, while the C-4
position of the ring is either unsubstituted or has a methyl group.
The C-5 position of the ring in these cases is substituted with an
alkoxy group or with a phenoxy group (45–55).
The amino acid conjugates (90–123) of the 5-alkoxy-2-tert-butyl group containing 8-quinolinamines (45–49) were subsequently synthesized wherein both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
amino acids were placed at the side chain terminal amino group. Herein,
we report synthesis, antimalarial, antileishmanial, and antimicrobial
activities of the synthesized 8-quinolinamines and their amino acid
conjugates.

Results and Discussion
With a view to prepare the target
quinoline derivatives, the key
intermediates 6-methoxy-8-nitroquinolines (1–11) were synthesized by adopting the literature methods.6−8 5-Alkoxy/aryloxy-6-methoxy-8-nitroquinolines (1–5 and 11) were synthesized by reaction of corresponding
4-alkoxy-6-methoxy-2-nitroanilines with acrolein via Skraup synthesis
in the presence of arsenic(V) oxide and o-phosphoric
acid at 100 °C, whereas compounds 6–10 were
prepared by the reaction of respective nitroanilines with methylvinylketone
in the presence of o-phosphoric acid at 100 °C.
The 8-nitroquinolines (1–11) upon direct ring
alkylation via silver-catalyzed radical oxidative decarboxylation
of trimethylacetic acid in the presence of ammonium persulfate in
CH3CN and 10% H2SO4 at 80 °C
produced 2-tert-butyl-5-alkoxy/aryloxy-6-methoxy-8-nitroquinolines
(12–22). The nitroquinolines (12–22) were converted to the requisite 2-tert-butyl-4,5-disubstituted-N8-(4-amino-1-methylbutyl)-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamines
(45–55) in three steps following the previously
published procedure (Scheme 1).9−11

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 2-tert-Butyl-4,5-disubstituted-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamines
(45–55)
Reactions and conditions:
(i)
(CH3)3CCO2H, AgNO3, (NH4)2S2O8, 10% H2SO4, CH3CN, 80 °C, 15 min; (ii) Raney
Ni, H2, EtOH, 45 psi, 45 min; (iii) 2-(4-bromopentyl)-1,3-isoindolinedione,
Et3N, 120 °C, 16 h; and (iv) NH2NH2·H2O, EtOH, 120 °C, 6 h.

First, catalytic hydrogenation of 12–22 with
Raney nickel in absolute ethanol gave 2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-4/5-substituted-8-aminoquinolines
(23–33). Condensation reaction of (23–33) with 2-(4-bromopentyl)-1,3-isoindolinedione in the presence of
triethylamine (TEA) at 120 °C provides 2-[4-(2-tert-butyl-4/5-substituted-8-quinolylamino)pentyl]-1,3-isoindolinediones
(34–44), which upon hydrozinolysis with hydrazine
hydrate in the presence of ethanol at 80 °C for 24 h afforded
4/5-substituted-2-tert-butylprimaquine derivatives
(45–55). 2-tert-Butyl-5-alkoxy-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamines
(45–49) upon condensation reaction with N-α-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected amino acids in
the presence of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in dichloromethane
(CH2Cl2) for 4 h gave the protected amino acid
derivatives (56–99) in excellent yields.12 The reactive amino group present at the side
chain was protected by a Boc group in the cases of Lys and Orn. At
the same time, Arg was protected by a dicarbobenzyloxy (di-Cbz) group
on the guanido group, while amino acid His was protected by a Nπ-benzyloxymethyl group on the imidazole ring. The
remaining coupled amino acids required no protection on the side chain.
A combination of hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Ile, Phe, Ala, and
Trp) and hydrophilic amino acids (Lys, Orn, Arg, d-Arg, Pro,
and His) was conjugated with a view to examine the role of their side
chains in bioactivity.

The removal of the side chain N-Cbz group of the
protected Arg amino acid derivatives was accomplished using 10% Pd/C
in MeOH. The final Boc protection in the presence of 4 N HCl in MeOH
proceeded smoothly to afford the free amino group containing 8-quinolinamine
amino acid conjugates (90–123) (Scheme 2).13

Antimalarial Activity
Determination
of in vitro antimalarial
activity was based on the assay of plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) activity.21 The antimalarial activities
of all synthesized analogues are reported as IC50 values
against CQS (D6) and CQR (W2) strains of P. falciparum in Table 1. Among
the analogues, the most effective was N4-(2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-5-(pentyloxy)quinolin-8-yl)-pentane-1,4-diamine
(R = OC5H11, R1 = H, 46), which exhibited potent antimalarial activity with IC50 of 20 ng/mL for D6 strain and 22 ng/mL for W2 clone of P. falciparum. In the same test, standard drugs CQ
produced IC50s of 15.0 ng/mL (D6 clone) and 140 ng/mL (W2
clone) and artemisinin (ART) produced IC50s of 11.0 ng/mL
(D6 clone) and 9.0 ng/mL (W2 clone).

a IC50 is the concentration
(μg/mL) that affords 50% inhibition of growth; NC, not cytotoxic
up to 4760 ng/mL (4.76 μg/mL). NA, not active. Selectivity index
is the ratio of IC50 in Vero cells to IC50 in P. falciparum (D6 or W2).

Other notable analogues of the series, 47 [R = OC6H13, R1 = H, IC50 = 42 ng/mL
(D6 strain), IC50 = 42 ng/mL (W2 strain)], 48 [R = OC7H15, R1 = H, IC50 = 50 ng/mL (D6 strain), IC50 = 37 ng/mL (W2 strain)], 49 [R = OC8H17, R1 = H, IC50 = 53 ng/mL (D6 strain), IC50 = 40 ng/mL (W2 strain)], 55 [R = OPh(3,4-Cl2), R1 = H, IC50 = 140 ng/mL (D6 strain), IC50 = 130 ng/mL (W2
strain)], 92 [R = OC5H11, R1 = H, R2 = Lys, IC50 = 110 ng/mL (D6
strain), IC50 = 52 ng/mL (W2 strain)], 99 [R
= OC6H13, R1 = H, R2 =
Lys, IC50 = 90 ng/mL (D6 strain), IC50 = 36
ng/mL (W2 strain)], 111 [R = OC7H15, R1 = H, R2 = Arg, IC50 = 390 ng/mL
(D6 strain), IC50 = 240 ng/mL (W2 strain)], and 120 [R = OC8H17, R1 = H, R2 = Met, IC50 = 160 ng/mL (D6 strain), IC50 =
150 ng/mL (W2 strain)], also produced potent in vitro antimalarial
activities (Table 1). The remaining analogues of the series were either moderately active
or did not show any inhibition of P. falciparum. It is important to note that 8-quinolinamines produced higher inhibition
of drug-resistant W2 strain compared to drug-sensitive D6 of P. falciparum, clearly amplifying the significance
of this class in drug-resistant malaria. We observed potent antimalarial
activity by 8-quinolinamines (46–49) that contains
an alkoxy group (ranged between C5 and C8) and a 2-tert-butyl group. The addition of a methyl group at the C-4 position
compounds 46–49 results in a dramatic loss of
activity (compounds 50–54). The conjugation of
compounds (45–49) with an amino acid generally
results in the loss of antimalarial activity; however, basic amino
acids (Lys and Arg)-conjugated compounds 92, 99, and 111 displayed promising antimalarial activity,
though to a degree less than their nonconjugated counterparts.

All analogues were also evaluated for cytotoxicity up to the highest
test concentration of 4760 ng/mL in a panel of four cancerous cell
lines (SK-MEL, KB, BT-549, and SK-OV-3) and two noncancerous mammalian
cells (VERO and LLC-PK1) using the neutral red assay procedure as
described earlier,22,23 and none showed any cytotoxicity,
thereby exhibiting a selectivity index ranged between >216 and
>1.2
for the protozoan parasitic infection.

The most promising 8-quinoliamines
were then evaluated for the
blood-schizontocidal antimalarial activity against P. berghei (sensitive strain) in a rodent model (Table 2).10 Briefly, testing was conducted at various concentrations
orally in Swiss mice (six mice per group). The concentrations tested
were 100, 50, 25, and 10 mg/kg/day × 4 (oral). The compounds
were administered on days 0–3 after infection. The results
were compared to a positive control group of mice treated with CQ
at the suppressive dose of 10 mg/kg/day × 4 (oral) and a negative
control group of mice where no treatment for the infection was administered,
and in this case, 100% mortality is observed within 6–8 days,
with a mean survival time of 6.2 days. Except for 8-quinolinamine 51 that was inactive, all other analogues (46–50, 92, 99, 111, and 121) produced 100% cure at the primary tested dose of 100 mg/kg against P. berghei infection in mice. Upon evaluation at
the subsequent lower dose of 50 mg/kg, compounds 46–49 and 111 produced 100% cure with all treated animals
surviving on day 60 (termination of experiment), while remaining compounds 50, 92, 99, and 121 produced suppressive activity. Analogues 46–49 also produced curative activity at the lower dose of 25 mg/kg, while
the remaining tested compounds were inactive with no animals surviving
at the termination of the experiment on day 60. None of the analogues
(46–49) were curative at the lowest test concentration
of 10 mg/kg but produced suppressive activity with few surviving animals
(Table 2). Analogues 46–49 were then tested in vivo against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium yoelli nigeriensis.10 Compounds 46 and 47 cured 100%
mice at a dose of 100 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. The same compounds
were suppressive at the lowest tested dose of 25 mg/kg. At the same
time, analogues 48 and 49 were suppressive
at the tested dose of 100 and 50 mg/kg, while they were inactive at
the lowest tested dose of 25 mg/kg (Table 2). The in vitro results corroborated by the
in vivo antimalarial results further confirmed the advantage of synthesized
8-quinolinamines in drug-resistant malaria chemotherapy. We noted
that the presence of the pentaloxy group at the C-5 position of the
quinoline ring along with a 2-tert-butyl group provide
optimum activity, while the introduction of a methyl group at the
C-4 position results in a dramatic loss of activity. In the cases
of amino acid-conjugated 8-quinolinamines, the attachment of basic
amino acids, especially Lys, results in enhanced antimalarial activity.

a The term “curative”
indicates complete elimination of malaria parasites from the body,
and animals survive up to day D + 60. The term “active”
or “suppressive” indicates that all of the treated animals
show negative parasitaemia up to D + 7. However, by D + 60, some mice
die, and some survive with complete elimination of parasitaemia. The
term “inactive” indicates that the treated animals show
positive parasitaemia either on D + 4 or D + 7 and usually die by
D + 14.

Antileishmanial Activity
Antileishmanial activity of
the 8-quinolinamines was tested in vitro against a culture of Leishmania donovani promastigotes by alamarBlue assay.24,25 It was interesting to note that 8-quinolinamine analogues, 47–49, 50, 52–53, 95, 97–98, 102–103, 105, 113–114, and 116 exhibited strong antileishmanial activities, with IC50 values ranging between 0.84 and 5.9 μg/mL (Table 3). The activity was comparable
to the standard drug pentamidine (IC50 = 1.4 μg/mL)
used as the positive control. Their IC90 values ranged
from 1.95 to 22 μg/mL as compared to IC90 of 6.0
μg/mL for pentamidine. However, analogues were less potent than
amphotericin B (IC50 = 0.1 μg/mL and IC90 = 0.3 μg/mL). The notable examples that produced potent activities
are 52 (IC50 = 1.77 μg/mL, IC90 = 2.55 μg/mL), 53 (IC50 = 0.84 μg/mL,
IC90 = 1.95 μg/mL), 95 (IC50 = 3.5 μg/mL, IC90 = 6.5 μg/mL), 97 (IC50 = 4.0 μg/mL, IC90 = 6.5 μg/mL), 105 (IC50 = 3.5 μg/mL, IC90 =
7.0 μg/mL), 113 (IC50 = 3.8 μg/mL,
IC90 = 7 μg/mL), and 114 (IC50 = 3.8 μg/mL, IC90 = 7 μg/mL).

a IC50 and IC90 are the sample concentrations

to vehicle control.

It is
interesting to note that most active antileishmanial compound 53 (R = OC7H15, R1 = CH3) produced very weak antimalarial activity, hence providing
a high degree of selectivity for leishmania infection. Interestingly,
an exact opposite trend for activity was noted for leishmania when
compared to malaria. In these cases, higher activity was observed
for compounds that possess a methyl group at the C-4 position. The
same trend was also observed for conjugated 8-quinolinamines, wherein
almost all basic amino acid conjugates were inactive as antileishmanials
while those with hydrophobic amino acids displayed high activity (Table 3).

Antifungal
Activity
The antifungal activities of the
8-quinolinamines against the opportunistic yeast Candida
albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Cryptococcus
neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus along with the positive control amphotericin B are summarized in Table 4. IC50s,
MICs, and MFCs were determined according to the National Committee
for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) methods.26−28

a IC50 = the concentration
(μg/mL) that affords 50% growth inhibition. MIC, minimum inhibitory
concentration (the lowest concentration in μg/mL that allows
no detectable growth). MFC, minimum fungicidal concentration (the
lowest concentration in μg/mL that kills the organism). NA,
no activity at the highest test concentration of 20 μg/mL.

Analogue 48 exhibited
a broad spectrum of antifungal
activities among all 8-quinolinamines tested and produced fungicidal
action against C. albicans (IC50 = 4.93 μg/mL, MIC = MFC = 10 μg/mL), C. glabrata (IC50 = 3.96 μg/mL,
MIC = MFC = 5.0 μg/mL), C. krusei (IC50 = 4.44 μg/mL, MIC = MFC = 5.0 μg/mL), C. neoformans (IC50 = 2.07 μg/mL,
MIC = MFC = 2.50 μg/mL), and A. fumigatus (IC50 = 6.0 μg/mL). Analogues 49, 52, and 53 also exhibited promising activity
against all the fungal strains with MICs as low as 5.0 μg/mL.
Several other compounds produced promising antifungal effects with
IC50 values in the range of 0.58–6.8 μg/mL
against C. neoformans. These compounds
also exhibited MICs in the range of 1.25–5.0 μg/mL against C. neoformans with MFC values in the range of 2.5–5.0
μg/mL (Table 4). Compounds 50 and 53 turned out to be
highly effective against C. neoformans with IC50 of 0.58 and 0.67 μg/mL, respectively.
These values are comparable to standard drug amphotericin used in
the experiments. In a nutshell, the presence of the C-5-heptyloxy
group with or without a C-4 methyl group at the 8-quinolinamine structure
exhibited potent antifungal activity while the attachment of amino
acids to the quinoline side chain produced inactive analogues.

Antibacterial
Activity
The antibacterial activities
of the 8-quinolinamines against Staphylococcus aureus (SA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Mycobacterium intracellulare are reported in Table 5, including the positive control ciprofloxacin. Susceptibility of
SA and MRSA to test compounds was determined according to the procedure
as described by the NCCLS.27,28

a IC50 = the concentration

Susceptibility
of M. intracellulare was done using
the modified alamarBlue procedure of Franzblau et
al.29 Most of the analogues (46–50, 52–53, 55, 94–98, 101–103, 105, 108, 112–116, 119, and 121) exhibited potent antibacterial activity against SA (IC50 = 1.33–9.04 μg/mL, MIC = 2.5–10.0 μg/mL,
MBC = 5.0–20.0 μg/mL). Compounds 49, 50, 52–53, 55, 95, 98, 103, 105, and 112–116 were bactericidal at 5.0 and 10.0 μg/mL
against SA (Table 5). Several analogues (46–50, 52–53, 55, 94–98, 101–106, 108, 112–116, 120, and 122–123) exhibited high antibacterial activity
against MRSA (IC50 = 1.38–10.48 μg/mL and
MIC = 5.0–10.0 μg/mL). Compounds 47–48, 50, 52–53, 55, 98, and 114–115 were bactericidal at 5
and 10 μg/mL against MRSA (MBC). Analogues 47–53, 55, 93–98, 100, 102–103, 108, 114–115, and 118 showed activity against M.
intracellulare (IC50 = 3.12–14.95
μg/mL and MIC = 5.0–20.0 μg/mL). Compounds 47–48 and 52–53 were bactericidal
against M. intracellulare at 5.0 and
10.0 μg/mL (Table 5). It can be seen that analogues (47–48, 52–53, 98, 103, and 114) displayed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities
by exhibiting promising inhibition of all strains at a low micromolar
concentration. In these cases, both 8-quinolinamines and their amino
acid analogues displayed activity. The choice of amino acid did not
impact much with reference to activity as both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
amino acid conjugates showed antibacterial activity.

Conclusions
We have synthesized new 8-quinolinamines and examined their biological
activity. Analogues 46–49 produced potent antimalarial
activity in vitro against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains
of P. falciparum. The same compounds
were 100% curative against drug-sensitive P. berghei and multidrug-resistant P. yoelli nigeriensis infection in mice. The reported quinolinamines also produced potent
in vitro activity against L. donovani with IC50 as low as 0.84 μg/mL. At the same time,
very promising and potent activities were observed against opportunistic
pathogenic infections such as C. neoformans, SA, and MRSA (IC50s ≥
0.58, ≥1.33 and ≥1.38 μg/mL, respectively). None
of the analogues exhibit any cytotoxicity at the highest test concentration,
confirming their selectivity for the pathogenic infections. As evident
from the abovementioned discussion, many 8-quinolinamines besides
exhibiting potent antimalarial activity also exhibit potent antileishmanial
and antimicrobial activities and therefore provide impetus to develop
this class of quinolines as a broad-spectrum anti-infective. The results
of this study confirm the importance of the 8-qunolinamines class
of compounds in the treatment of parasitic infections and microbial
infections. The most promising analogues reported herein forms a panel
for further optimization and preclinical studies.

available from commercial suppliers and used without any purification
unless otherwise stated. Various heterocycles, solvent, and other
reagents were purchased from commercial sources such as Sigma-Aldrich,
Alfa Aesar, Merck, TCI, Avra, and Chem-Impex. Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 spectrometer.
Chemical shifts of the given data for 1H NMR were reported
as δ values, and coupling constants were in hertz (Hz). The
following abbreviations were used for spin multiplicity: s = singlet,
d = doublet, t = triplet, dd = double doublet, m = multiplet, q =
quadruplet, td = triplet of doublet, dt = doublet of triplet, br s
= broad singlet, and if splitting patterns could not be interpreted
easily, they are reported as multiplet (m). Thin layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on Merck precoated silica gel plates (0.25 mm,
60 Å pore size) impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254
nm). Visualization on TLC was observed under UV light (254 nm) or
staining with iodine or Dragendorff’s reagent solution. Synthesized
compounds were isolated by automated flash chromatography on silica
gel (200–400 mesh). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were
recorded on Bruker maXis.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 5-Substituted-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-nitroquinolines 12–22
5-Substituted-6-methoxy-8-nitroquinolines (1–11, 1.0 mmol) in CH3CN (5 mL) were dissolved, and the reaction
mixture was heated to 80 °C. Silver nitrate (0.6 mmol), trimethylacetic
acid (3.0 mmol), and 10% H2SO4 (10 mL) were
then added to the reaction mixture. A freshly prepared solution of
ammonium persulfate (3.0 mmol) in water (10 mL) was added drop wise
to the preheated mixture (80 °C) during 10 min. The heating source
was then removed, and reaction proceeded with the evolution of carbon
dioxide. After 15 min, the reaction mixture was poured onto ice and
made alkaline by adding 30% aqueous NH4OH solution. The
reaction mixture was extracted with ethylacetate (4 × 50 mL),
and combined extracts were washed with brine solution (2 × 10
mL) and dried over Na2SO4, and the solvent was
removed under vacuum to afford oil, which upon column chromatography
over silica gel (230–400 mesh) afforded products. For products 12–16, elution was done in EtOAc/hexane (1:99), while
products 17–21 were eluted in EtOAc/hexane (3:97),
and compound 22 was isolated in EtOAc/hexane (2:98).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 5-Substituted-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamines 23–33
A solution of 5-substituted-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-nitroquinolines
(12–22, 5.0 mmol) in 95% absolute alcohol (15
mL) was hydrogenated over Raney nickel (T1 grade) at 45 psi in a Parr
hydrogenator for 45 min. The catalyst was removed by filtration, and
the filtrate was evaporated under vacuum to afford 5-alkoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamines.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of 2-[4-(5-Substituted-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolylamino)pentyl]-1,3-isoindolinediones 34–44
To a stirred solution of 5-substituted-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolamine (23–33, 1.0 mmol) and 2-(4-bromopentyl)-1,3-isoindolinedione (3.0 mmol),
TEA (3.0 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir
at 120 °C for 16 h. The residue was purified on silica (230–400
mesh) using EtOAc/hexanes (60:40) to afford product as viscous oil.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of N8-(4-Amino-1-methylbutyl)-5-substituted-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamines 45–55
To a solution of 2-[4-(5-substituted-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolylamino)pentyl]-1,3-isoindolinedione
(34–44, 1.0 mmol) in 95% ethyl alcohol (25 mL)
was added hydrazine hydrate (25 mmol), and the mixture was heated
under reflux for 8 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure,
and the residue was diluted with water (25 mL). The reaction mixture
was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 20 mL),
and evaporation of the solvent under reduced under pressure gave the
desired product.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Amino
Acid Conjugates
of N8-(4-Amino-1-methylbutyl)-5-alkoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamines 90–123
To an ice-cooled stirred solution of N8-(4-amino-1-methylbutyl)-5-alkoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamines (45–49, 1.0
mmol) and d/l-Z/Boc-amino acid (1.1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (15 mL), DCC (1.1 mmol) was added. The reaction
mixture was allowed to attain room temperature, and stirring was continued
for another 4 h. The reaction mixture was kept in a refrigerator overnight,
and the separated 1,3-dicyclohexylurea was filtered. The filtrate
was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (3–5
mL) followed by water (2–5 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to
afford the crude product, which was purified by flash column chromatography
on silica gel (230–400 mesh) using CH3OH/CHCl3 (2:98) to afford N8-(4-amino-1-methylbutyl)-5-alkoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-methoxy-8-quinolinamine-amino acid conjugates
(56–89) as viscous oil.

For the Arg-conjugated
derivative, first carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) on the side chain was removed.
To a mixture of side chain Cbz-protected amino acid-linked derivatives
(1 mmol), glacial acetic acid (1 mL) was added 10% Pd–C (200
mg) in methanol (30 mL). A slow stream of hydrogen gas was bubbled
through the reaction mixture for 1 h. The catalyst was removed by
filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuum to afford
the product.

To a mixture of the Boc-amino acid-linked derivative
(1 mmol) was
added a solution of 4 N HCl in MeOH, and the reaction mixture was
stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. The removal of the solvent
afforded the product.

Assay for in Vitro Antimalarial Activity
A suspension
of red blood cells infected with D6 or W2 strains of P. falciparum (200 μL, with 2% parasitemia
and 2% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% human
serum and 60 μg/mL amikacin) is added to the wells of a 96-well
plate containing 10 μL of test samples diluted in medium at
various concentrations. The plate is placed in a modular incubation
chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, CA) and flushed with a gas mixture of
90% N2, 5% O2, and 5% CO2 and incubated
at 37 °C for 72 h. Parasitic LDH activity, as a measure of growth,
is determined by using Malstat reagent (Flow Inc., Portland, OR) according
to the procedure of Makler and Hinrichs.21 Briefly, 20 μL of the incubation mixture is mixed with 100
μL of the Malstat reagent and incubated at room temperature
for 30 min. A 1:1 mixture (20 μL) of NBT/PES (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) is then added, and the plate is further incubated in the dark
for 1 h. The reaction is then stopped by the addition of 100 μL
of a 5% acetic acid solution. The plate is read at 650 nm using the
EL-340 Biokinetics Reader (BioTek Instruments, Vermont). IC50 values are computed from the dose response curves. ART and CQ are
included in each assay as the drug controls. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
(0.25%) is used as vehicle control.

Cytotoxicity Assay
The in vitro cytotoxicity studies
were performed against four human cancer cell lines (SK-OV-3, SK-MEL,
KB, and BT-549) and two noncancerous mammalian kidney cell lines (LLC-PK1
and VERO).22,23 All cell lines were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

The assay was
performed in 96-well tissue culture-treated microplates, and targeted
peptides were tested up to a highest concentration of 10 μg/mL.
The cells (25 000 cells/well) were seeded to the wells of the
plate and incubated for 24 h for confluence. The 8-quinolinamine samples
were added and plates again incubated for 48 h. The number of viable
cells was calculated through a modified version of neutral red uptake
assay. The marketed drug doxorubicin was used in study as a positive
control, while DMSO was used as the negative control.

Assay for
Blood-Schizontocidal Activity Evaluation Against P.
berghei and P. yoelli nigeriensis Infection in Mice
The method used for screening of the
synthesized compounds for their blood-schizontocidal activity is based
on a comparison of responses by groups of treated and control mice,
six in each group, after infection with P. berghei or P. yoelli nigeriensis.10 Test animals (Swiss mice of either sex, approximately
15–20 g and same age) were housed in metal-topped cages and
given a standard laboratory diet and water ad libitum. To check factors
such as changes in the infectivity of the strain or in the susceptibility
of the host or to detect technical errors, a group of infected animals
treated with CQ diphosphate at dose levels (10 mg/kg/day × 4),
producing definite increases in the survival time, is included as
a positive control in every experiment. In each experiment, the test
compounds were administered in graded doses of 100, 50, 25, and 10
mg/kg. The compounds showing curative activity at 10 mg/kg were further
selected for screening at lower doses. On day “0”, groups
of six mice each were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 × 107 infected erythrocytes from a donor mouse. Four hours later,
mice were administered test compounds/CQ/vehicle orally. A total of
four doses were given orally on days D “0”, D + 1, D
+ 2, and D + 3. The tail blood smears were made on days D + 4 and
D + 7, stained with Giemsa, and examined microscopically. The minimum
dose that completely suppressed parasitaemia on days D + 4 and D +
7 was termed as the minimum effective dose, and the minimum dose that
cleared the parasitaemia for up to 60 days was termed as the curative
dose. The terms “curative”, “active”,
and “inactive” are used to describe the biological activities
exhibited by the tested compounds. The term “curative”
indicates complete elimination of malaria parasites from the body,
so that relapse cannot occur up to day D + 60, and all mice survived.
The term “active” indicates that the treated animals
show negative parasitaemia up to D + 7. However, by D + 28, 50% or
more mice show a negative and the remaining mice may show a positive
test result for parasitaemia. The term “inactive” indicates
that the treated animals show a positive test result for parasitaemia
either on D + 4 or D + 7 or on both D + 4 and D + 7 and animal usually
dies by D + 14.

Assay for in Vitro Antileishmanial Activity
Antileishmanial
activity of the compounds was tested in vitro against a culture of L. donovani promastigotes. They were grown in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco Chem. Co.)
at 26 °C. A 3 day-old culture was diluted to 5 × 105 promastigotes/mL. Drug dilutions (50–3.1 μg/mL)
were prepared directly in cell suspension in 96-well plates. Plates
were incubated at 26 °C for 48 h, and growth of leishmania promastigotes
was determined by alamarBlue assay as described earlier.24,25 Standard fluorescence was measured on a FLUOstar Galaxy plate reader
(BMG Lab Technologies) at an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and an
emission wavelength of 590 nm. Pentamidine and amphotericin B were
used as the standard antileishmanial agents. IC50 and IC90 values were computed from dose curves generated by plotting
percent growth versus drug concentration.

Assay for in Vitro Antimicrobial
Activity
The antifungal
activities of the compounds against C. albicans ATCC90028, C. glabrata ATCC90030, C. krusei ATCC6258, C. neoformans ATCC90113, and A. fumigatus ATCC
90906 were determined according to modified NCCLS methods.26−28 The antibacterial activities of synthesized compounds were evaluated
against SA (ATCC29213), MRSA (ATCC33591), and M. intracellulare (ATCC23068). SA and MRSA susceptibility to test compounds was determined
using NCCLS methods,27,28 and M. intracellulare susceptibility to the synthetic compounds was tested by using the
modified alamarBlue procedure of Franzblau et al.29

The test compounds were serially diluted in 20% DMSO/saline
and transferred in duplicate to 96-well flat-bottomed microplates,
and inocula were prepared by correcting the OD630 of microbe suspensions
in an incubation broth [Sabouraud Dextrose (Difco) for fungi, cation-adjusted
Mueller–Hinton (Difco) at pH 7.3 for non-mycobacterial bacteria,
and 5% alamarBlue (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) in Middlebrook
7H9 broth with OADC enrichment, pH 7.3 for M. intracellulare] to afford the following: fungi 1.5 × 103, non-mycobaterial
bacteria 5 × 105, and M. intracellulare 2.0 × 106 CFU/mL. The drug controls [Ciprofloxacin
(ICN Biomedicals, Ohio) for bacteria and amphotericin B (ICN Biomedicals,
Ohio) for fungi] were used in each assay of tested peptides. All organisms
were read at either 530 nm using the BioTek PowerWave XS plate reader
(BioTek Instruments, Vermont) or 544ex/590em (M. intracellulare) using the POLARstar
Galaxy plate reader (BMG Lab Technologies, Germany) prior to and after
incubation: SA/MRSA at 35 °C for 16–20 h, fungi at 35
°C for 70–74 h, and M. intracellulare at 37 °C and 10% CO2 for 70–74 h. The MIC
value was defined as the lowest test concentration that allows no
detectable growth (for M. intracellulare, no color changes from blue to pink). For all 8-quinolinamines, minimum
fungicidal or bactericidal concentrations were determined by removing
5 DL from each clear (or blue) well, transferring to agar and incubating,
as mentioned previously. The MFC and MBC for tested compounds were
defined as the lowest test concentration that kills the organism (exhibited
no growth on agar plates).
