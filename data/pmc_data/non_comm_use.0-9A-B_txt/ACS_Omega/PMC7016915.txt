Hyperbolic
metamaterials demonstrate exotic optical properties
that are poised to find applications in subdiffraction imaging and
hyperlenses. Key challenges remain for practical applications, such
as high energy losses and lack of hyperbolic properties in shorter
wavelengths. In this work, a new oxide–metal (ZnO–Au)
hybrid-material system in the vertically aligned nanocomposite thin-film
form has been demonstrated with very promising in-plane two-phase
ordering using a one-step growth method. Au nanopillars grow epitaxially
in the ZnO matrix, and the pillar morphology, orientation, and quasi-hexagonal
in-plane ordering are found to be effectively tuned by the growth
parameters. Strong surface plasmon resonance has been observed in
the hybrid system in the UV–vis range, and highly anisotropic
dielectric properties have resulted with much broader and tunable
hyperbolic wavelength regimes. The observed strain-driven two-phase
in-plane ordering and its novel tunable hyperbolic metamaterial properties
all demonstrate strong potential for future oxide–metal hybrid-material
design toward future integrated hybrid photonics.

Introduction
Optical metamaterials
with epsilon near-zero (ENZ) permittivity
and hyperbolic dispersion can be created in nanostructures that consist
of periodic arrangements of negative permittivity. The periodic nature
of these structures creates photonic band gaps in which certain wavelengths
of electromagnetic radiation are not permitted to propagate within
the material. One way to achieve this structure is through directly
embedding arrays of metallic nanowires into a dielectric medium, which
is expected to create ENZ permittivity1,2 and lead to
hyperbolic dispersion.3,4 The exciting realization of ENZ
in the visible range could lead to exotic functionalities including
light squeezing by subwavelength waveguides,5,6 light
tunneling,7 and invisible cloaking.8 Nanowire arrays present large aspect ratios,
which lead to uniaxial anisotropy and hyperbolic dispersion, in which
one direction of the material behaves like a metal and in the other
direction it behaves as a dielectric.3,9 Hyperbolic
metamaterials were first theorized and created for optical imaging
beyond the diffraction limit,9 but new
research has led to applications in high Tc superconductivity10,11 and as a potential platform for
studying the fundamental physical phenomenon.12−15

Much effort has been devoted
toward the realization of metallic
nanoarray structures for metamaterial application with techniques
such as electrochemical deposition,16 e-beam
lithography,17 and the anodic aluminum
oxide (AAO) template method.18,19 Although promising,
the AAO template and lithography methods are typically limited by
material selection, tedious multistep growth methods, and scalability.19 It was also reported that hyperbolic dispersion
and ENZ permittivity are strongly correlated with the anisotropy and
ordering of the metallic nanowire array. Thus, it is important to
precisely control the metamaterials on a nanoscale for highly tunable
properties. Another critical need is to produce metamaterials with
hyperbolicity in shorter wavelength regimes (e.g., visible), while
the demonstrated hyperbolic metamaterials are mostly in the longer
wavelength regime (e.g., infrared).

Recent efforts are focused
on oxide–metal hybrid metamaterials
in vertically aligned nanocomposites (VANs) form, grown through a
one-step pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. VANs have demonstrated
their potential in nanoscale metamaterial design through robust material
selection and highly anisotropic optical properties.20,21 The unique vertical strain coupling along the two-phase interface
has led to unique multifunctionalities.22−26 However, extensive work on morphology tuning and
strain engineering has been focused on oxide–oxide VAN systems
and related properties.22,27−29 The work on strain engineering and morphology tuning in oxide–metal
systems is scarce.30,31

In this work, a new oxide–metal
hybrid metamaterial (ZnO–Au)
in the VAN form has been demonstrated using PLD. As illustrated in Figure 1, the Au nanopillars
grow uniformly and epitaxially in the ZnO matrix. In this study, Au
was selected as the plasmonic metallic nanostructure in the metamaterial
and ZnO was selected as the matrix due to its well-known dielectric
response and piezoelectric properties. ZnO was also selected for other
properties such as nontoxicity, earth abundance, and enhanced photocatalytic
properties.32 The proposed morphology tuning
can be achieved by varying the growth parameters such as oxygen partial
pressure and laser deposition frequency. Through the morphology and
in-plane ordering control, it is expected to achieve tunable optical
responses such as hyperbolic behavior and wavelength range, anisotropic
complex dielectric properties, and plasmonic wavelength. Thus, detailed
microstructural analysis including transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) mapping are conducted to couple with the optical properties
measured by optical transmittance and ellipsometry.

the ZnO–Au VAN grown on c-cut Al2O3 and

A high degree of morphological control is possible through changing
oxygen background and frequency in pulsed laser deposition.

Results and Discussion
One of the
challenges for growing a high-quality ZnO–Au
VAN was the vastly different crystal structures between Au (FCC) and
hexagonal ZnO (Wurtzite, HCP). This was surmounted by growing the
ZnO–Au VAN on the α-Al2O3 substrate.
There have been no reports for growth of the oxide–metal VAN
in oxygen ambient due to metals hazarding a chance of oxidation upon
ablation in an oxygen ambient. Oxidation was determined not to occur,
as there was no presence of Au–oxide peaks in any X-ray diffraction
(XRD) scans in Figure 2e or 3e or any diffraction spots besides those
from Au, ZnO, or sapphire in selective area electron diffraction (SAED)
patterns in Supporting Information Figure S1a,b. Interestingly, successful growth required an oxygen ambient. When
growth was performed in vacuum, this led to irregular morphology and
films that would easily wipe away caused by poor adhesion, possibly
due to high laser plume kinetic energy. The use of a background pressure
could create confinement of the plasma plume and modulation of kinetic
energy, leading to more regular film growth and morphology. Formation
of the ZnO–Au VAN is believed to follow a general three-step
mechanism, similar to other oxide–metal VANs.21 A diagram of the formation mechanism can be found in Supporting
Information Figure S2. Following the diagram
in Supporting Information Figure S2, ZnO
and Au adatoms arrive at the Al2O3 substrate
and undergo surface diffusion. Second, initial nucleation begins.
Owing to the different surface energies, Au nucleates as 3D islands
and ZnO as 2D layers. Growth continues in this manner, with Au 3D
island forming nanopillars and ZnO growing layer by layer to form
the matrix. Finally, ZnO–Au forms as a pillar-in-matrix vertically
aligned nanocomposite.

For optimized vertical nanopillar growth, 50 mTorr oxygen background
pressure created absolute vertical growth, as seen in Figure 2a.1. The 50 mTorr film shows
strong hexagonal faceted Au nanopillars arranged in hexagonal long-range
order, seen in the STEM plan-view image in Figure 2a.5. The mesoscale quasi-hexagonal ordering
is more obvious in the low-resolution STEM image in Supporting Information Figure S3. EDS-mapping was performed on the 50
mTorr sample in Figure 2a.2,a.4 to show there was no significant interdiffusion between Au
and ZnO. To further confirm this, high-resolution STEM was performed
in Figure 2a.3. This
image was taken from the ⟨101̅0⟩ zone axis of
the sapphire substrate and shows the cross-section atomic arrangement
of Au and ZnO with a distinct heterointerface.

Background pressure
was further increased to investigate the effect
of kinetic modulation on the nanopillar morphology. Films were grown
at 100 and 200 mTorr, as seen in Figure 2b.1,c.1. The average pillar diameter was
calculated by measuring the diameter of pillars in STEM plan-view
images in Figure 2a.5,b.2.
The measured diameters were then plotted as a histogram in Figure 2d, and the average
diameter was taken as the mean value of the histogram. This method
is adopted from techniques used to calculate grain size distributions.33,34 The histogram indicates that the average pillar diameter increases
from ∼15 nm at 50 mTorr to ∼18 nm at 100 mTorr. For
the film grown at 200 mTorr in Figure 2c.1, the cross-section image shows that nanopillars
became randomly orientated and the plan-view image in Figure 2c.2 illustrates the irregular
shape and loss of hexagonal ordering. In this case, the average diameter
was difficult to calculate due to the irregular shape of the nanopillars.
Based on STEM images coupled with the pillar diameter histogram data,
the lower background pressure leads to a more uniform nanopillar distribution
(Figure 2a.5), while
the higher background pressure leads to a wider diameter distribution
(Figure 2b.2,c.2).
The pillar alignment is denoted in Figure 2a.1–c.1 with yellow arrows. Upon increasing
to 100 mTorr, the nanopillar alignment appears tuned from vertical
to slightly tilted. Increasing further to 200 mTorr, the pillars become
more randomly orientated in the ZnO matrix. Overall, it is suggested
here that lower background pressure leads to more uniform and vertically
aligned pillar morphology.

X-ray diffraction was conducted to
investigate the microstructure
and epitaxial quality of the ZnO–Au VAN. Scans of θ–2θ
were performed for films deposited under different oxygen background
pressures and shown in Figure 2e. These scans show highly textured growth with the preferred
out-of-plane direction for ZnO is (0002) and for Au is (111), growing
parallel with the (0006) plane of Al2O3. The
ZnO–Au VAN was found to have an epitaxial relationship of Au(111)
∥ ZnO(0002) ∥ Al2O3(0006). To
overcome the vastly different lattice structure, Au rotates to (111)
orientation to match both the underlying substrate and the matrix.
This (111) plane is the close-packed plane for the face-centered cubic
lattice with 6-fold symmetry but a different plane stacking sequence
compared to the structure of the ZnO matrix or the Al2O3 substrate. The hexagonal shape of the (111) orientation of
Au is also evidenced in the highly faceted Au pillar shape as seen
in plan-view images. Moreover, the in-plane epitaxial relationship
is determined from the plan-view SAED pattern and the cross-section
SAED pattern in Supporting Information Figure S1 and found to be Au {220} ∥ ZnO {11̅00} ∥
{12̅10}.

To investigate the strain states of the films,
the out-of-plane d-spacing was calculated and is
plotted in Figure 2f. For ZnO matrix, increasing
the background pressure decreased the d-spacing value from the bulk
value of (0002), which indicated an increased compressive strain.
For Au nanopillars, increased background caused d-spacing values to
decrease toward the bulk value of (111), which indicated a decreased
tensile stress. Interestingly, the tendency of the lattice parameter
to decrease with the background pressure corresponded to an increased
nanopillar diameter and tuned orientation. This lattice strain tuning
could be related to the morphology seen in Figure 2a–c. At 50 mTorr, the Au nanopillars
are in a high strain state and growth is vertically aligned with both
local and long-range hexagonal ordering. Au nanopillars in the 200
mTorr are in a low strain state and have random ordering with little
to no hexagonal ordering. Based on the observed morphologies, the
tendency of Au to grow into highly ordered, hexagonally faceted structures
is believed to be driven by high strain and a desire to reduce interfacial
energy with the ZnO matrix.

In parallel to tuning oxygen pressure,
a set of the laser frequency
study was conducted and is summarized in Figure 3. Cross-section STEM images are shown for
each frequency of Figure 3(a.1) 2 Hz, (b.1) 5 Hz, and (c.1) 10 Hz. Corresponding plan-view
STEM images are shown for Figure 3(a.2) 2 Hz, (b.2) 5 Hz, and (c.2) 10 Hz. A red hexagon
in Figure 3c.2 in the
plan-view image denotes the quasi-hexagonal in-plane ordering. EDS-mapping
combined with STEM was performed on the plan-view 10 Hz sample to
further show the distinct two-phase growth of Au and ZnO as seen in Figure 3c.4–6 with
the corresponding HAADF appearing in Figure 3c.3. The EDS-mapping confirms the sufficiently
low interdiffusion similar to that of the background pressure series.
High-resolution TEM was conducted on the 10 Hz sample to demonstrate
the hexagonal shape and faceted nanopillars, shown in Figure 3c.7, as well as the in-plane
atomic arrangement. The six sides of the pillar are indexed as {220}
family of planes.

To understand the effect of frequency on epitaxial
quality and
microstructure, a detailed XRD study was performed with scans shown
in Figure 3e and out-of-plane d-spacing values were calculated in Figure 3f. The average diameters were calculated
by a similar method as highlighted above and plotted as a histogram
in Figure 3d. The films
grown had diameters of 27, 18, and 15 nm for deposition at 2, 5, and
10 Hz, respectively. As the frequency is increased, statistically
the diameter of Au nanopillars is decreased. This is observed from
plan-view STEM images in Figure 3a.2–c.2. It is suggested here that increasing
the pulse frequency will shorten the diffusion length of impinged
adatoms. The increased frequency will impede the ability of adatoms
to reach thermodynamic equilibrium, creating disorder and strain in
the film. This is observed with XRD scans in Figure 3e and the calculated d-spacing
in Figure 3f. For the
2 Hz film, ZnO d-spacing is close to the bulk value
of (0002), but as the frequency is increased to 5 and 10 Hz, the d-spacing decreases, indicating an increase in compressive
stress. Conversely, the d-spacing of (111) Au at
2 Hz is greater than the bulk value and gradually increases with frequency,
indicating an increase in the out-of-plane tension of nanopillars.

The advantage of the film grown in this report is the inherent
anisotropy and strain engineering, which leads to hyperbolic dispersion
and epsilon near-zero permittivity. Strong plasmonic resonance is
expected at the ZnO/Au interface, making the ZnO–Au hybrid
material useful for different types of gas sensors and energy harvesting.35,36 Due to the excellent epitaxial quality, as seen in XRD scans above
for the deposited ZnO–Au VAN, the optical properties are expected
to be enhanced as compared with other metallic nanowire arrays and
ZnO–Au nanocomposites. To directly observe plasmonic resonance
of the ZnO–Au VAN, UV–vis transmittance spectra were
obtained. The results of the films deposited at different background
pressures are shown in Figure 4a, and those for a different laser frequency are shown in Figure 4b. There is an obvious
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) caused by Au in the transmittance
spectra, occurring at around 600 nm. The red shift of the plasmon
resonance in the case of background pressure spectra in Figure 4a correlates with the randomization
of nanopillar orientation and caused by a broadening of the absorption
edge. The transmission (T%) overall decreases for
films at a higher background pressure, possibly due to more light
being scattered and absorbed by the film because of an increased pillar
size and changed orientation. Optical band gap values were calculated
via a Tauc method to investigate the effect Au inclusion had on the
ZnO optical band gap. The band gaps calculated for oxygen pressure
are shown in Supporting Information Figure S4a. There is no obvious trend in the optical band gap tuning with respect
to background pressure tuning.

Figure 4 UV–Vis transmission (%T) spectra of the
ZnO–Au VAN in the range of 200–1500 nm with changes
in (a) oxygen background pressure and (b) laser frequency. Insets
on each graph are models depicting each nanocomposite. The minimum
in the graph represents the plasmonic response of Au and was measured
and recorded for each film on the respective graph.

Transmission spectra were also obtained for films deposited
at
a different laser pulse frequency and are presented in Figure 4b. There is a plasmon resonance
dip occurring at around 600 nm due to the Au nanopillars. The absorption
edge slightly broadens as the frequency is increased, possibly due
to an increased number of Au nanopillars. The surface plasmon minima
also broaden with the increasing background pressure, possibly caused
by a higher level of strain. Optical band gaps were calculated for
frequency variation films and are plotted in Supporting Information Figure S4b. As frequency increases, the optical
band gap decreases. The ZnO–Au film deposited at 10 Hz has
a higher density of pillars than the film deposited at 2 Hz. A higher
density of pillars could create more interfaces, increasing the amount
of light that is scattered and decreasing the optical band gap.

The hyperbolic properties observed in optical metamaterials are
a direct result of the isofrequency surface of extraordinary waves,
which is given by the following formula4  The hyperbolic dispersion and ENZ permittivity
of the ZnO–Au VAN were investigated through spectroscopic ellipsometry.
The real part of the dielectric function, related to the permittivity
of the film, is presented in Figure 5. Representative isofrequency curves, which determine
the photonic density of states that can be supported within the material,
are shown in each graph. The regions are color-coded to their corresponding
surface of either a hyperboloid of two sheets (blue shaded color)
or a hyperboloid of one sheet (red shaded color). Data was measured
from 210 to 2500 nm at three different angles of 30, 45, and 60°.
The data were fitted with a uniaxial model to discern the in-plane
and out-of-plane components of the dielectric function. A B-spline
model was used on both in-plane and out-of-plane, and a reasonable
mean square error (MSE) <5 occurred for all films. Ellipsometry
parameters psi and delta are shown in the Supporting Information. The anisotropy axis is shown for each experimental
setup in (a), (b), (c), and (d) with subscripts ∥ and ⊥
indicating, respectively, the components parallel (in-plane) and perpendicular
(out-of-plane) to the anisotropy axis.

Figure 5 Real parts of ε∥
and ε⊥ are graphed for
(a) 50 mTorr, (b) 200 mTorr, (c) 2 Hz, and (d) 10 Hz. Regimes of hyperbolicity
are marked on the graphs in both red and blue, corresponding to the
respective isofrequency curves of either a hyperboloid of two sheets
(blue) or a hyperboloid of one sheet (red). The polarization of the
beam experiment with respect to the microstructure of each film is
shown in (a), (b), (c), and (d). The parallel and perpendicular directions
of permittivity are marked on the cross-section STEM image.

The ZnO–Au films grown in this work all
have hyperbolic
dispersion and ENZ points across many different ranges, but most interestingly,
they all have it in the shorter wavelength (visible) regime. The permittivity
of the film deposited at 50 mTorr is shown in Figure 5a, and the permittivity of the 200 mTorr
film is shown in Figure 5b. The film grown at 50 mTorr shows hyperbolic dispersion in the
visible spectrum and in the near-infrared regime up to the far end
of the measured spectrum. In the 50 mTorr film, ε∥ (in-plane component) behaves mostly as a dielectric material except
for in the visible regime from around 500 to 700 nm, where ε∥ is driven negative, caused by the surface plasmon
resonance. The perpendicular component ε⊥ (out-of-plane)
has a permittivity with strictly metallic behavior. The 50 mTorr film
in the visible regime has hyperbolic dispersion with an isofrequency
surface of a hyperboloid of two sheets (blue shaded color), and in
the near-infrared regime, the surface is tuned to become a hyperboloid
of one sheet (red shaded color). The 50 mTorr film also has three
ENZ points, two in the parallel direction in the visible regime at
520 and 625 nm and the perpendicular component has one ENZ point in
the visible regime at 715 nm. The hyperbolic properties of the 50
mTorr film correlate well with the overall hexagonal ordered, vertically
aligned morphology. Vertically aligned Au metallic nanopillars cause
the perpendicular permittivity to be negative, and the ZnO dielectric
media is expressed in the parallel component having positive permittivity.
When Au nanopillar morphology is tuned by growth at 200 mTorr to be
randomly arranged in Figure 5b, this leads to an increased number of epsilon near-zero
(ENZ) points in the visible and infrared spectra. The parallel component
has ENZ points of 657, 835, and 1762 nm, while the perpendicular component
has ENZ points at 744 and 1468 nm. It is also possible to change the
hyperbolic isofrequency surface in the long range (above 1500 nm)
from a hyperboloid of one sheet in the 50 mTorr film to a hyperboloid
of two sheets in the 200 mTorr film. The 200 mTorr film has an interesting
parallel component with almost near-zero permittivity for the entire
measured spectrum regime. It oscillates between being slightly negative
and slightly positive while crossing zero permittivity at three different
points, though it never has a permittivity outside of ±3. A material
with epsilon near-zero permittivity and hyperbolic dispersion across
a broad-spectrum range is of particular interest for subdiffraction
imaging or other hyperbolic metamaterial application.37

The effect of frequency tuning on hyperbolic dispersion
was also
investigated. The permittivity of the film grown at 2 Hz is shown
in Figure 5c, in which
the film only has a small hyperbolic regime in the visible spectrum
and the perpendicular component has ENZ points at 515 and 697 nm.
Upon increasing laser frequency, the number of ENZ points increases
and the film demonstrates hyperbolic dispersion in the near infrared.
The perpendicular component has ENZ points at 542, 595, 716, and 1348
nm. Tuning pulse laser deposition frequency changes the size and number
of hyperbolic regimes, but it does not tune the overall isofrequency
surface geometry. As compared with the background pressure series
of films, the pulse laser frequency series does not have as good of
hyperbolic properties, but the series does have significant epsilon
near-zero permittivity points.

Parallel systematic tuning experiments
of pulsed laser frequency
and oxygen background pressure were designed to investigate the effect
on strain states and morphology in the ZnO–Au VAN structure,
as per Figure 1. Frequency
dependence was selected as one of the studies because it is well-known
to affect the oxide–metal VAN diameter,30 where the diameter of nanowires has been highly correlated
with optical properties.38 Conversely,
background pressure was studied because its effect on the oxide–metal
VAN has not yet been studied. Individual Au nanopillars in the matrix
grown at high strain states were shown to have beautiful, faceted,
hexagonal structure and long-range quasi-hexagonal in-plane order.
Of the two series of films of oxygen background pressure and laser
frequency, each series demonstrated an ability to tune the hyperbolic
properties of the films in unique ways. There are a few key conclusions
that can be surmised when considering the background pressure series
and the pulse laser frequency series. Overall, the background pressure
series shows broader hyperbolic properties in both shorter and longer
wavelengths compared with the pulse laser frequency series, which
is ideal for tunable hyperbolic metamaterial application. Changing
the background pressure from 50 to 200 mTorr allows the isofrequency
surface to be tuned. The easily controllable isofrequency curve in
the visible and infrared regimes is something not previously demonstrated.
Manipulating the isofrequency surface is important because it is useful
in an application for focusing in hyperlenses and subdiffraction imaging.39 In the pulse laser frequency series, by changing
the deposition frequency from 2 to 10 Hz, this created a hyperbolic
regime in the infrared and increased the number of epsilon near-zero
permittivity points. Overall, the background pressure series demonstrated
superior hyperbolic metamaterial properties and wider application
when compared with the pulse laser frequency series. The key issue
facing the hyperbolic metamaterial in their application includes small
hyperbolic regimes, controllability, and lack of properties in visible
regimes. The background pressure series solves most of these key issues;
it demonstrates broad hyperbolicity in both short and long wavelengths,
and through manipulation of morphology and the quasi-hexagonal in-plane
ordering in these films, it is possible to easily control metamaterial
properties.

Conclusions
Two-phase ZnO–Au VAN films have
been grown through a simple,
self-assembly one-step PLD method. ZnO–Au nanocomposites morphology
demonstrated beautiful, vertically aligned Au pillars with quasi-hexagonal
in-plane ordering that were embedded in a ZnO matrix. The effect of
PLD parameters on film morphology and strain was investigated through
different experimental growth series, an oxygen background pressure
series, and a pulse laser frequency series. Background pressure showed
an ability to tune the orientation and ordering of the Au nanopillars,
while pulse frequency was able to tune the size of pillars. High strain
states lead to a small pillar size and a high degree of quasi-hexagonal
in-plane ordering, while low strain states induce decreased ordering
and a large pillar size. The ZnO–Au VAN due to its anisotropy
and strain-driven hexagonal-closed packed ordering demonstrates interesting
hyperbolic dispersion and epsilon near-zero (ENZ) permittivity in
both the visible and near-infrared regimes. Plasmonic properties are
shown to be easily controlled through morphology. As well, the ZnO–Au
VAN was found to have excellent epitaxial quality, lending to enhanced
optical properties, potential energy, and sensor application. Future
work will focus on the application of the ZnO–Au VAN in the
sensor and metamaterial technologies.

Experimental Section
Thin-Film
Growth
ZnO–Au vertically aligned nanocomposite
films were grown through pulsed laser deposition on c-cut Al2O3 (0001) in two series, an oxygen background pressure
series and a pulse laser frequency series. Across all series, deposition
was performed with a KrF excimer laser (Lambda Physik Complex Pro
205, λ = 248 nm), and the substrate temperature was kept constant
at 500 °C. The laser beam was focused with an incident angle
of 45° with a laser energy of 420 mJ. The target–substrate
distance was kept constant at 4.5 cm and measured before each deposition
to ensure accuracy. A nanocomposite target composed of 1:1 Au/ZnO
developed through solid-state sintering was used for laser ablation.
Before deposition, the chamber was pumped down to around 10–6 mTorr before an oxygen pressure was inflowed. For the background
pressure series, deposition occurred from 50 to 200 mTorr with a constant
pulse frequency of 5 Hz. The pulse laser frequency series maintained
a constant pressure of 100 mTorr, while laser frequency repetition
was varied from 2 to 10 Hz. The reference sample between the two series
was deposited at 5 Hz and 100 mTorr. After all depositions, the chamber
was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 15 °C/min.

Microstructure
Characterization
Film morphology was
characterized through XRD, TEM, and STEM coupled with EDS-mapping.
XRD scans of θ–2θ were conducted using a Panalytical
X’Pert X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Bright-field
TEM, STEM, SAED patterns, and EDS-mapping were performed in an FEI
Talos F200X TEM. Samples for electron microscopy were prepared, for
both cross-section and plan-view, via a standard grinding procedure,
which entails manual grinding, polishing, dimpling, and a final ion
milling step to achieve electron transparency (PIPS 691 precision
ion polishing system, 5 keV for the cross-section sample, and 4–4.5
keV for the plan-view sample).

Optical Measurements
Ellipsometry experiments were
carried out on an RC2 spectroscopic ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam Company).
Three angles 30, 45, and 60° were measured from a spectrum range
of 210–2500 nm. Psi and delta data obtained from ellipsometry
experiments and then fit with a uniaxial model coupled with the B-spline
model were used to discern anisotropic permittivity properties of
the ZnO–Au VAN, and an agreeable mean square error (MSE) <5
was obtained for all film models. Normal incident depolarized transmittance
(T%) was measured using an optical spectrophotometer
(Lambda 1050 UV–vis spectrophotometer).
