A mutually correlated
green protocol has been devised that originates
from a sustainable production of β-Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles
which is used for an efficient catalytic synthesis of versatile substituted
tetrazoles, under mild reaction conditions in water via a simple,
one-pot, eco-friendly method. The synthesis is followed by derivatization
into a highly fluorescence active compound 9-(4-(5-(quinolin-2-yl)-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole that
can be used at tracer concentrations (0.1 μM) to detect as well
as quantify hydrogen peroxide down to 2 μM concentration. The
nanocatalyst was synthesized by a simple, proficient, and cost-effective
methodology and characterized thoroughly by UV–vis absorption
and Fourier transform infrared spectra, N2 adsorption/desorption,
high resolution transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction
pattern, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric
analysis. Broad substrate scope, easy handling, higher efficiency,
low cost, and reusability of the catalyst are some of the important
features of this heterogeneous catalytic system. The strong analytical
performance of the resultant derivative in low-level quantification
of potentially hazardous hydrogen peroxide is the key success of the
overall green synthesis procedure reported here.

1 Introduction
Sustainable
synthesis of nitrogen rich heterocycles has attracted
growing interest over a decade. In this regard, tetrazoles, a group
of five-membered ring compounds containing four nitrogen atoms, have
received wide attention in recent years because of their vast and
extraordinary activity in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry1−4 (Scheme 1). They
also have a similar implementation in the field of industrial chemistry,
chemistry of materials (including light sensitive agents, polymers,
energy materials, various explosives, etc.),5−9 and coordination chemistry.10,11 Furthermore, tetrazoles have a wide range of agricultural applications,12,13 for instance, they are used to control unwanted herbs and fungi
and help to regulate the plant growth.

Scheme 1 Potent Molecules
Bearing Tetrazole Skeleton
Because of these wide range of applications, development
of an
efficient synthetic route for tetrazole-based compounds is in vogue.
In this context, numerous synthetic strategies are reported in the
literature. After the pioneering work by Hantzsch and Vagt,14 a variety of modified procedures were developed,
but majority of them were based on the addition of azides to the nitrile
groups,15−20 while some groups have also used isocyanide,21 primary alcohols, aldehydes22 and so forth, in different toxic organic solvent media. All the
reactions were carried out under homogeneous conditions using stoichiometric
amount of metal catalysts,23,24 Lewis acids25−27 or ionic liquids.28 Besides, there are
a plethora of contributions related to diverse types of homogeneous
catalytic systems reported in literature.29−33 However, use of expensive ligands and toxic organic
solvents, probability of metal contamination in the products, application
of additives, and finally lack of reusability of the catalyst demand
serious attentions. An efficient greener alternative where the catalyst
can be reused through an environment-friendly manner is therefore
welcome. Very recently, some heterogeneous catalytic systems34−38 have also been developed to overcome these drawbacks. Till now,
heterogeneous transition metal catalyzed synthetic pathways are one
of the most interesting as well as challenging areas. In this context,
nickel as a transition metal catalyst, creates a promising center
of attraction toward the researchers. Nanoparticles (NPs), having
unusually huge surface area and large number of active sites, can
efficiently catalyze several organic reactions providing the advantages
of high atom economy, mild reaction conditions, simplified isolation
of product, easy recovery, and recyclability of the catalysts.39−41 Considering the ongoing attempts and increasing awareness to develop
simple, environment-friendly, economic, and profitable synthetic methods,
nickel-based NPs can serve as a powerful alternative.42,43 Incidentally, several reports are available in the literature regarding
the synthesis of tetrazole compounds catalyzed by diverse type of
nickel-based NPs.44−48 Moreover, aldoxime derivatives have captured the attention of synthetic
organic chemists during the past few years49−51 because of
their good reactivity and less toxic nature and the fact that they
can be prepared very easily. Very recently, Patil,52 Babu,53 and Matsugi54 have reported, respectively, the homogeneous
Cu(OAc)2, InCl3, and DPPA catalyzed synthesis
of 5-substituted 1H-tetrazoles from aldoxime and
sodium azide.

On the other hand, the past decade has witnessed
a surge in the
sensing application of several materials for ultratrace sensing of
hydrogen peroxide because of multiple reasons.55−58 It is one of the most powerful
oxidizing agents and is a proficient generator of reactive oxygen
species.59,60 H2O2 has immense applications
in the industrial and medicinal fields.61,62 Additionally,
H2O2 is produced by all living cells upon reduction
of O2 by NADPH oxidase63,64 and by several
other mechanisms also.65−68 Such production is believed to get enhanced with aging and other
ailments.69−71 Moreover, it may enter the body system with certain
beverages like instant coffee or sanitized water. Sensing of H2O2 in different samples of environmental, industrial,
and biological importance at trace scale is therefore required together
with suitable remediation methods. An extensive study of H2O2 sensing methods have been done by several researchers.57,72−76 The most popularly selected methods involve electrochemical techniques
which entail special laboratory setup and requirements.77,78 Reports on spectral methods of H2O2 sensing
are in severe dearth in recent days, despite their easy handling and
measurement conditions.79,80

In this context,
we hope to introduce here a novel and efficient
synthetic strategy of designing recyclable heterogeneous nickel hydroxide
NPs to surmount several aforementioned obstructions in the synthesis
of 5-substituted 1H-tetrazoles starting from aldoximes
and sodium azide in water under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 2). Using our protocol,
we finally end up in designing 9-(4-(5-(quinolin-2-yl)-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole (compound 6) as a spin off. Only 0.1 μM concentration of this
compound is potent enough for spectrofluorimetric sensing of trace
concentrations of H2O2. The overall synthesis
methods and the sensing experiments have been performed in green solvent
media utilizing hassle free techniques and hazard free reagents. A
comparison of the present sensing method as well as the efficacy of
the catalytic activity of the Ni(OH)2 NPs with the literature
is presented in Tables S1 and S2 respectively
in the Supporting Information.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
Ni(OH)2 NPs
Nickel hydroxide NPs were prepared
by refluxing nickel
acetate and sodium hydroxide in ethanol in the presence of catalytic
amount of acetic acid for 1.5 h (Scheme 3). The hydroxide NP formation in this case
is assisted by acetic acid, which helps to generate nanodimensional
mesoporous Ni(OH)2 NPs.81,82 The instantaneous
hydroxide precipitation due to the addition of NaOH in the medium
is hindered by the presence of acetic acid; hence, a slow rate of
hydroxide formation results in the generation of multiple nucleation
sites with small particles in the nanostate. A molar ratio of 2.5:1
of alkali to acid in the medium was found to be most suitable for
the generation of nanodimensional particles in the solution.82 For characterization, the as-synthesized NPs
were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (DRS)-UV and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), N2 adsorption/desorption, and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA).

Scheme 3 Schematic Diagram for the Synthesis of Ni(OH)2 NPs
2.1.1 PXRD
and N2 Adsorption/Desorption
Isotherm
The phase composition and form of the newly synthesized
nickel hydroxide were examined by PXRD analysis (Figure 1a). All the diffraction peaks
are in good agreement with the hexagonal β-Ni(OH)2 with lattice constants a = 3.12 and c = 4.6 Å (JCPDS no. 14-0117). Figure 1b represents the PXRD pattern of the reused
β-Ni(OH)2 NPs (after fifth cycle). The specific surface
area and porous nature of Ni(OH)2 NPs were measured from
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) gas-adsorption measurements.
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of the porous nickel
hydroxide NPs is shown in Figure 2a, and the corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution plot is given in Figure 2b. The catalyst shows an isotherm similar
to type IV, characteristic of mesoporous materials, and the hysteresis
loop is of type H1. The BET specific surface area of the material
was found to be 160.5 m2 g–1. The average
pore diameter according to the BJH plot calculated from the N2 desorption isotherm was 3.87 nm, indicating that the sample
has mesoscale pores.

spectral density (PSD) curve of β-Ni(OH)2.

2.1.2 DRS-UV
and FTIR Spectral Analysis
Figure 3a shows absorption
spectrum of the β-Ni(OH)2 in the UV and visible region.
β-Ni(OH)2 showed an absorption maximum at 245 nm
which is attributed to band gap absorptions in β-Ni(OH)2.83 The absorption spectra exhibit
three bands at 312, 386 nm, and a broad band centered at 670 nm for
β-Ni(OH)2, which are governed by the d–d transitions.
The FTIR spectra of the synthesized β-Ni(OH)2 NPs
are shown in Figure 3b. The strong absorption at 521 cm–1 is due to
Ni–O–H bending and Ni–O stretching vibrations.
The band at 1632 cm–1 is assigned to the bending
vibration for absorbed water molecule. The sharp peak at 3645 cm–1 corresponds to the stretching vibration mode of nonhydrogen-bonded
hydroxyl groups. The broad band centered at 3429 cm–1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of water molecules
in the nickel hydroxide material.

and (b) FTIR spectra of β-Ni(OH)2 NPs.

2.1.3 Field-Emission SEM (FESEM)
and High Resolution
TEM (HRTEM) Analysis
Figure 4 shows the SEM images of Ni(OH)2 NPs. The
images indicate good uniformity of the Ni(OH)2 material,
and these NPs have an uniform average size below 10 nm. Figure 5a represents the HRTEM images
of β-Ni(OH)2. Here, the NPs are in 5–10 nm
range in diameter (Figure 5b) while the pore diameter is in 3–4 nm range. The
average particle size was estimated from the PSD plot (Figure 5b) and was found to be 7.6
nm. Mesopores are created during nucleation and agglomeration of the
NPs and are generated out of the interconnected NPs forming interparticle
spaces. TEM image of recycled β-Ni(OH)2 (after third
run) is given in Figure 5c.

2.1.4 Thermogravimetry (TG)–Differential
Thermal (DTA) Analyses
The thermal behavior of β-Ni(OH)2 NPs was investigated using TG and DT measurement (Figure 6). The TG curve showed
that β-Ni(OH)2 started to decompose slowly after
100 °C. The major weight loss happened between 220 and 450 °C.
The total weight loss was measured to be 32.44% (calculated value
32.51%). The DT curve showed an endothermic peak with a maximum located
at 296 °C, corresponds to endothermic behavior during the decomposition
of β-Ni(OH)2 to NiO. The thermal decomposition process
can be represented as  

Figure 6 TG–DTA
of the β-Ni(OH)2.

2.2 Synthesis of Tetrazoles from Aldoximes and
Sodium Azide Using Ni(OH)2 NPs
A number of reactions
were performed to optimize the reaction conditions with variation
of diverse factors, viz., amount of catalyst, solvent, base, and temperature
for the representative reaction of benzaldehyde oxime (1a) and sodium azide. The whole scenario is presented in Table 1. The reaction cannot be performed
without any catalyst (Table 1, entry 1), which clearly indicates its synthetic importance.
Then, the reaction was performed with the variation of solvents, bases,
and temperature. The reaction gave poor-to-moderately good yields
in DMF, toluene, p-xylene, and dioxane and in neat
condition (Table 1,
entry 2–6). However, among all the solvents, best yield was
obtained from the water medium. It was also found that K2CO3 produced the best result amongst Cs2CO3, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, and K3PO4 (Table 1, entry 10–13). Because the reaction was not proceeding
at room temperature, all the reactions were carried out under refluxing
conditions (Table 1, entry 8–9). Overall, the best yield resulted with 4.32 mol
% of Ni(OH)2 NPs in water after refluxing at 100 °C
for 10 h under air (Table 1, entry 7).

b Yields are obtained by gas chromatography.

After the attainment of the
optimum conditions, we tried to explore
the scope and efficacy of the newly generated catalyst and methodology
to furnish the diversely substituted tetrazoles. It is found that
aromatic aldoximes efficiently underwent this reaction to produce
excellent product yields. The concise results are clearly represented
in Table 2. This protocol
is equally compatible with the substrates having both electron donating
(−Me, −OH, −OMe) as well as electron withdrawing
(−Cl, −Br, and −NO2) groups, giving
well-to-excellent product yields. All the o-, m-, and p-nitro benzaldehyde oximes underwent
this reaction efficiently giving the corresponding 5-substituted tetrazoles
(Table 2, 2c, 2d, 2e) in good-to-excellent yields.
Next, chloro- and bromo-substituted benzaldehyde oxime smoothly reacted
with the azide to furnish the corresponding tetrazoles (Table 2, 2f, 2g, 2h) with very good yields. These observations undoubtedly
signify the sensitivity and compatibility of this protocol. Next,
3,4-dimethoxy benzaldehyde oxime provided 5-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1H-tetrazole (Table 2, 2i) in 91% yield. Furthermore, a variety of
hydroxyl-substituted benzaldoximes also went through these reaction
conditions providing the respective products (Table 2, 2k, 2l, 2m) with very good yields.

c 12 h was required.

d 15 h time was required.

Next, the applicability of this technique was extended
for the
reaction between heterocyclic aldoximes and azide. Table 3 clearly represented the results.
Furan-2-carbaldehyde oxime, thiophene-2-carbaldehyde oxime, and pyridine-2-carbaldehyde
oxime effortlessly underwent this reaction to produce 3a, 3b, and 3c with 89, 91, and 93% yields.
Likewise, quinoline-2-carboxaldehyde oxime and indole-3-carbaldehyde
oxime gave the products (Table 3, 3d, 3e) with very good yields.

After achieving the remarkable success
in application of our methodology
in case of aromatic as well as heterocyclic aldoximes, we tried to
extend the scope in case of aliphatic aldoximes also. The results
are summarized in Table 4. Formaldehyde oxime and heptanal oxime efficiently reacted with
sodium azide to give the respective tetrazoles (Table 4, 4a, 4b) with
moderate-to-good yields (75 and 72% yields). (2E)-Cinnamaldehyde
oxime underwent this reaction with complete retention of configuration
giving the corresponding (E)-5-styryl-1H-tetrazole (Table 4, 4c) as a sole product (selectivity ratio of E/Z is equal to 100:0). Once more, this
observation evidently highlights the specificity of our methodology.

The synthetic importance of our
current catalytic protocol was
further examined through the synthesis of 9-(4-(5-(quinolin-2-yl)-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)-phenyl)-9H-carbazole (compound 6). The synthetic pathway is represented in Scheme 4. Herein, 9-(4-iodophenyl)-9H-carbazole (compound 5) was prepared from
carbazole and 1,4-diiodo benzene with 85% yield. Thereafter, an efficient
C–N cross-coupling reaction between 2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-quinoline
(Table 3, 3d) and compound 5 produced compound 6 with
89% of yield.

Scheme 4 Schematic Route of Compound 6
The compound 6 was found to have potential spectral
features for sensing applications. The UV–vis absorption spectrum
showed a prominent λmax at a wavelength of 292 nm
with a considerable absorption intensity of a 0.057 μM solution
(solution B) (Figure 7). The same solution upon excitation at this wavelength shows an
emission maximum at λem = 384 nm. The fluorescence
yield (φf) of the compound was calculated using a
standard comparative method and was found to be 0.09% against a standard
tryptophan solution.

Figure 7 UV–vis absorption spectra of compound 6 in
the presence of hydrogen peroxide.

2.3 Spectral Sensing of Hydrogen Peroxide
The absorption intensity at the λmax position of
292 nm of the aforesaid solution of compound 6 (solution
B) shows a gradual increase with increasing concentration of H2O2 solution (2–19 mM) (Figure 7). This UV–vis absorption
of the compound at this wavelength corresponds to n → π*
transitions, which originate from the nonbonded electron pairs of
nitrogen to the antibonding π orbitals of the aromatic moiety.
On treatment with H2O2, some oxidative reactions
generate bond cleavage,84,85 resulting in higher
concentration of nonbonded electron density, and hence, a gradual
increase in the absorbance value is observed (Figure 7). The fluorescence emission of solution
A (higher concentration of compound 6 was required for
emission quenching studies as compared to UV–vis absorption
spectral studies) was measured upon instantaneous addition of H2O2, which shows a reverse trend with increasing
H2O2 concentration in the range 2–16
mM. This is an obvious observation as the π conjugation decreases
due to bond disruptions with increasing oxidation by H2O2 (Figure 8). The resulting Stern–Volmer plot (inset of Figure 8) shows a steady increase in
the F0/F value with increasing
H2O2 concentration with a slope of 39 M–1 L (KSV), indicating steady
state interactions of the species with the fluorophore. The effect
is also observed in the fluorescence lifetime of the compound, which
suffers slight decrease (from 3.42 to 2.96 ns) upon oxidation with
H2O2 (Figure 9).

Figure 8 Fluorescence spectra and S–V plot of compound 6 in the presence of H2O2.

Figure 9 Fluorescence decay of compound 6 and H2O2-treated compound 6 with time.

The most interesting part of the
emission-based experiments was
observed when a much lower concentration of H2O2 was used to treat the solution of compound 6 (solution
A). Instant addition of H2O2 solutions at lower
concentrations (2.4–14.2 μM) could not create observable
changes in the emission spectrum of solution A. However, a remarkable
hike in the emission intensity of solution A treated with H2O2 of such low concentration was observed, if the solutions
were allowed to rest for some time in the dark. Figure 10 shows a spectacular increase
in the emission intensity of solution A treated with 4.8 μM
H2O2 with increasing time interval. This observation
is particularly important as the lower limit of detection of H2O2 becomes even lower, and enhanced emission intensities
are observed instead of quenching which has much less specificity
for analytes. The reason behind such observations depends on the fact
that H2O2 initiates free radical reactions which
involve many rearrangement steps, thereby reassembling the fragments
of oxidation in a way that creates larger population of fluorophores
and hence enhanced emission intensity with increasing time.

Figure 10 Fluorescence
spectra of compound 6 and H2O2-treated
compound 6 with increasing intervals
of time.

We have measured the emissions
of solution A containing 2.4–14.2
μM H2O2 after keeping the systems in the
dark for 3, 24, and 90 h (Figure 11) and plotted their respective F0/F versus concentrations (inset of Figure 11) to obtain the
slopes which showed an increasing trend in magnitude (−0.021,
−0.022, and −0.037) with time. This reveals that higher
sensitivity of the method is expected with longer duration of rest.
The limit of detection for H2O2 observed here
is compared with some literature reports in Table S1.

Figure 11 Fluorescence spectra of compound 6 and H2O2-treated compound 6 after 3 h (A),
24 h
(B), and 90 h (C). I0/I vs [H2O2] plots are the given inset.

The cyclic voltammogram (Figure 12) clearly indicates
the redox activity of compound 6. It is notable that
the reduction peaks (−1.66 and
−1.007 V) appear along with oxidation peaks (1.468 and 1.664
V), which supports that the compound is easily oxidizable by hydrogen
peroxide with reduction potential (1.776 V). Therefore, it can also
be deduced that H2O2 undergoes easy reduction
to H2O during this redox process.

of compound 6.

The viability of the results is further strengthened by performing
the mass analysis using electrospray ionization (ESI–MS) technique. Figures S22 and S23 represent the ESI–MS
spectra of the compound 6 and H2O2-treated compound 6, respectively. The results are summarized
in Table 5. The results
clearly indicate that compound 6 undergoes different
types of oxidative bond cleavage upon treatment with H2O2.84,85 The compound 6 (C28H18N6), initially having a base peak
at m/z 439 for the [M + H]+ species undergoes elimination of N2 (“A”
in Figure S22) to generate a peak at m/z 410. With H2O2-treated compound, the base peak now comes at m/z 410. The most plausible products of oxidative bond cleavage
result in elimination of mass fragments with m/z 284 (for [C18H12N4]+•), 242 (for [C18H12N]+), 154 (for [C10H6N2]+•), and 128 (for [C9H6N]+) from compound 6 which can be clearly observed in the ESI–MS spectrum
(in Figure S23).

After getting excellent results upon application
of our newly synthesized
nanocatalyst, a preliminary investigation was undertaken to realize
the mechanism. The conversion of benzaldoxime to benzonitrile in the
absence of sodium azide was checked in the presence of the nickel
hydroxide nanocatalyst, which did not take place under refluxing conditions
in water. After 24 h, we get back the corresponding aldoxime without
formation of benzonitrile. This observation clearly indicates that
nitrile formation is not necessary in our methodology. The most probable
reaction pathway is represented in Scheme 5.52−54 Initially, the Ni(OH)2 NPs bind with the oxygen atom of the aldoxime to activate the C=N
bond. Then, azide ion undergoes cycloaddition with the activated imine
bond. The cycloaddition between the C=N bond of aldoxime and
azide takes place readily and form an intermediate. After removing
the catalyst followed by acidic work-up, the desired product 5-substituted-1H-tetrazole was obtained.

Mechanism
2.4 Recyclability
and Reusability of the Ni(OH)2 Nanocatalyst
Recyclability,
recommencement, and
thermal strength are the most important traits of a heterogeneous
catalyst. Hence, to estimate the possibility to recover and reuse
the nanocatalyst a model reaction between benzaldoxime and sodium
azide was performed under optimal reaction conditions. At the end
of the reaction, the catalyst was recovered through centrifugation,
followed by washing with water, ethyl acetate, and finally ethanol.
Then, the catalyst was dried at 80 °C for activation. Figure 13 represents that
the catalyst can be reused successfully for six times without noticeable
loss in the product yields. This fact is established by PXRD pattern
(Figure 1b, after the
fifth cycle), HRTEM (Figure 5c, after the third run) and FTIR (Figure S24, after the sixth cycle) study of the reused catalyst.

chart of the β-Ni(OH)2 NPs.

In a wider perspective, our newly generated methodology will
make
available a podium for the design of a sustainable and efficient synthetic
route for 5-substituted 1H-tetrazoles. In nut shell,
our catalytic system offers far better results as compared to other
literature reports. This fact is clearly supported by the comparative
study with the literature reports (Table S2, Supporting Information).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have developed an efficient green and atom-economic
novel synthetic route for the synthesis of 5-substituted 1H-tetrazoles starting from various aromatic, heterocyclic,
as well as aliphatic aldoximes under mild reaction conditions in the
presence of highly active and thermally stable, considerably recyclable
Ni(OH)2 NPs in water as a green solvent. The catalyst showed
excellent catalytic activity because of its nanocrystalline nature,
small particle size, large surface area, and good thermal stability.
The synthetic protocol proffers various advantages, viz. good-to-excellent
product yields, easy separation of catalyst, simple work-up, and eco-friendly
methodology. Besides, using this protocol as one of the key steps,
a fluorescent probe 9-(4-(5-(quinolin-2-yl)-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)-phenyl)-9H-carbazol was synthesized which is used at trace concentrations
for the “turn on” spectral sensing of hydrogen peroxide
at low concentrations. To the best of our familiarity, reports regarding
the heterogeneous Ni(OH)2 NPs catalyzed synthesis of 5-substituted
1H-tetrazoles from aldoximes are in severe dearth.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Ni(OAc)2·4H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), H2O2 (Merck), and
all other chemicals required for this study were used as received.
All solvents were used after distillation and drying, following the
standard procedure.

4.2 Instruments and Apparatus
Hermle
microprocessor-controlled high-speed table-top centrifuge (model Z
36 K) was used for centrifugation. The FTIR spectra of the samples
were recorded in the range 400–4000 cm–1 on
a PerkinElmer FTIR 783 spectrophotometer after pelletization using
KBr. TEM images were obtained using a JEM 2100 transmission electron
microscope. The surface morphology of the nanocatalyst was analyzed
using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss EVO40, UK) equipped with
an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry facility. Surface area, pore
size distribution, and mesopore volume were determined by N2 porosimetry using Quantasorb Nova 4000e and 4200e porosimeters and
Quanta chrome Novawin11.0 software upon sample outgassing in vacuo
at 120 °C for 2 h. Specific surface area was calculated by applying
the BET model. Pore size distributions and mesopore volumes were calculated
by applying the BJH model to the desorption branch of the isotherm.
PXRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer
fitted with a Lynx Eye high-speed strip detector and a Cu Kα
source (1.54 Å, 8.04 keV). TGA was done using a Mettler Toledo
TGA/DSC1 Star System under a N2 purge gas (60 cm3 min–1). The fluorescence study was done using
a PerkinElmer LS-55 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a quartz cell
with a 1.0 cm optical path length. The UV–vis absorption spectral
study was performed using an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer.
HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorocube 01-NL and 291 nm HORIBA nano-LED, IBH
DAS-6 decay analysis software was used for time correlated single
photon counting (TCSPC) lifetime spectroscopy. A Bioanalytical System
EPSILON electrochemical analyzer was used for the cyclic voltammetric
(CV) measurements. The measurements were carried out in the methanol
medium, with a three-electrode assembly consisting of a glassy carbon
disk working electrode, a platinum auxiliary electrode, and an aqueous
Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All the ESI–MS spectra were recorded
in a WATERS Xevo G2-SQTof instrument. The reactions were performed
in a 10 mL round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser under air.
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-analysis was performed on TLC silica
gel 60 F254. The products were purified using silica-gel
(60–120 mesh) column chromatography. NMR spectra were recorded
on a 400 MHz NMR instrument using CDCl3 and DMSO-D6 as solvents. The 1H chemical shifts
are reported in ppm relative to TMS. Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen
contents of all products were examined utilizing a PerkinElmer 2400
Series II CHN analyzer.

4.3 Synthesis of Nickel Hydroxide
NPs
To an ethanolic solution of Ni(OAc)2·4H2O (1.2 mmol, 40 mL), ethanolic solution of NaOH (2.5 mmol,
20 mL)
was added. Then, after addition of 0.15 mL glacial acetic acid to
it, the resulting mixture was refluxed for 1.5 h. After cooling, the
as-synthesized NPs were separated from the solution through centrifugation
at 6000 rpm for 8 min followed by redispersion in ethanol till the
pH becomes neutral. Finally, the catalyst was dried in an oven at
60 °C for 3 h. Scheme 3 represents the schematic diagram for the synthesis of Ni(OH)2 NPs.

4.4 General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Tetrazoles
A mixture of benzaldehyde oxime (1.0
mmol), NaN3 (1.5
mmol), K2CO3 (3.0 mmol), and Ni(OH)2 NPs (4 mg, 4.32 mol %) in water (3 mL) was refluxed for 10 h under
air. Then, after cooling to room temperature and separation of the
catalyst, the reaction mixture was treated with 5 mL HCl (4.5 M) followed
by extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The organic part
was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 (anhy.),
and evaporated to leave the crude product, which was purified by column
chromatography over silica gel with hexane/ethyl acetate as the eluent
to furnish pure 5-phenyl-1H-tetrazole (2a, yield 98%) as a white solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-D6): δ 8.04–8.03 (m, 2H), 7.45–7.44
(m, 3H).

4.5 Synthesis of 9-(4-Iodophenyl)-9H-carbazole (Compound 5, Scheme 4)
Compound 5 was prepared
following our previously reported methodology.86 A mixture of carbazole (1 mmol), 1,4-diiodo benzene (1
mmol), NaOH (1.2 mmol) and biogenic CuO NPs in DMF was heated at 120
°C for 15 h. Then, after cooling, the reaction mixture was taken
in ice cold water and extracted using ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL).
The organic part was separated, collected and washed with brine, dried
over Na2SO4 (anhy.), and evaporated to leave
the crude product that was purified by column chromatography to furnish
compound 5 (yield 85%) as a white solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.01 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.77 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.30–7.24
(m, 4H), 7.19–7.15 (m, 4H).

4.6 Synthesis
of 9-(4-(5-(Quinolin-2-yl)-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole (Compound 6, Scheme 4)
A mixture of 9-(4-iodophenyl)-9H-carbazole
(compound 5, 1 mmol), 3d (1 mmol), K2CO3 (2 mmol), N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine (20 mol %), and CuI (10 mol %) in p-xylene was refluxed for 16 h under air. Then, after cooling
to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure
and the reaction mixture was taken for solvent extraction using water
and ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The organic part was separated,
collected and washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 (anhy.), and evaporated to leave the crude product, which was purified
by column chromatography over silica gel with hexane/ethylacetate
(95:5) as eluent to furnish compound 6 (yield 89%) as
a yellowish white solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.36 (dd, J = 16.8, 8.4 Hz, 2H), 8.16
(d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H), 8.08 (d, J =
8.0 Hz, 2H), 8.03 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.87 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.79–7.75 (m, 1H), 7.61 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 1H), 7.54 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H),

4.7 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Water-Soluble
Tetrazoles
A mixture of formaldehyde oxime (1.0 mmol), NaN3 (1.5 mmol), K2CO3 (3.0 mmol), and Ni(OH)2 NPs (4 mg, 4.32 mol %) in water (1.5 mL) was refluxed for
18 h. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the water
phase was acidified to pH < 1 with concentrated HCl. Then, the
solution was extracted with excess ethyl acetate for five times. Thereafter,
the combined organic phase was dried under reduced pressure, and the
solid mass was washed with the solvent containing ethyl acetate/hexane
mixture (10:90) and then recrystallized from ethyl acetate yielding
1H-tetrazole as colourless solid.

4.8 Spectral Sensing of Hydrogen Peroxide
Compound 6 shows a characteristic UV vis absorption
spectrum with a prominent λmax at 292 nm. It was
dissolved in spectroscopic grade methanol to obtain a 0.114 μM
solution (A) for fluorescence studies and a 0.057 μM solution
(B) for UV–vis absorption spectral studies. A stock solution
of 490 mM H2O2 was prepared for sensing applications.
Portions of this stock solution (0.01 mL) were added to 2 mL of the
solution A for fluorescence spectral studies, and 0.01 mL portions
were added to 2 mL of solution B for UV–vis absorption spectral
studies. Further for increasing the sensitivity of the fluorescence
sensing method, 1000 times diluted H2O2 solution
(490 μM) was added and the emissions were recorded at increasing
intervals of time.

4.9 TCSPC Lifetime Spectroscopy
The fluorescence
lifetime of the above-mentioned solution of compound 6 and that of H2O2-treated solution were measured
by the TCSPC method using a nanosecond laser diode (291 nm) as the
light source. An IBH DAS-6 decay analysis software was used for deconvoluting
the fluorescence decay pattern. The mean fluorescence lifetimes for
the decay curves obtained from the two sets were calculated from the
respective decay times. The following equation was used to calculate
the average lifetime from the relative contribution of the components. 1  where
τi represents the decay time of
the sample, τav is
the average decay time, and ai indicates the coefficient of the ith component.

4.10 Cyclic Voltammetry
A 0.114 μM
acetonitrile solution of compound 6 was taken for CV
studies against tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte.
