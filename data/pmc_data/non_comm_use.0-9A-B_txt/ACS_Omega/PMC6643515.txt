Herein,
we report a convenient synthesis of unprecedented aza-diketopiperazines
(aza-DKPs). The strategy is based on selective diversification of
bicyclic aza-DKP scaffolds by click reaction, N-acylation, and/or
N-alkylation. These scaffolds containing either azido or amino groups
were obtained by a key Rh(I)-catalyzed hydroformylative cyclohydrocarbonylation
reaction of allyl-substituted aza-DKP. The methodology is readily
amenable to the parallel synthesis of original aza-DKPs to enlarge
the chemical diversity of aza-heterocycles.

Introduction
Small heterocyclic
scaffolds are of central importance in the development
of novel pharmacological probes and/or drug candidates.1 However, a recent literature analysis over the
last 30 years has shown that an average of only five new ring systems
per year have emerged.2 Therefore, to enlarge
the chemical diversity of scaffolds, we decided to design and to synthesize
novel aza-diketopiperazines (aza-DKPs) with potential applications
in medicinal chemistry. By contrast to the well-known 2,5-diketopiperazines
(2,5-DKPs),3 aza-DKPs have been much less
exploited and few synthetic approaches have been reported to date.4−10 Recently, we have shown that aza-DKPs were obtained following a
deprotection/cyclization process with a higher yield than 2,5-DKPs.10 In addition, the replacement of one Cα-stereogenic
center by a nitrogen atom resulted in a significant improvement of
both the water solubility and the microsomal stability of this scaffold
as compared to the 2,5-DKP analogue.10 We
have also described more complex aza-DKPs readily obtained following
a novel domino cyclohydrocarbonylation (CHC)/addition process.9 This methodology enabled the rapid and efficient
synthesis of novel three-dimensional (3D)-shaped bicyclic and tricyclic
aza-DKP scaffolds containing sp3-hybridized carbon atoms
and controlled stereocenters. Moreover, the analysis of their 3D molecular
descriptors and “drug-likeness” properties highlighted
not only their originality in the chemical space of aza-heterocycles
but also their higher likelihood of successfully progressing through
the hit-to-lead process.9b

Herein,
we report the synthesis of novel 6,6-bicyclic aza-DKPs
showing two points of diversification at N-2 and C-3 positions of
the scaffold (Figure 1). Cyclic systems fused to a 2,5-DKP showed interesting biological
activities.11−13 The ability to place the different substituents in
a structurally rigid three-dimensional arrangement should allow for
increased selectivity toward biological targets. The N-2 and C-3 positions
were selected as diversification points, as they are strategic sites
of functionalization for 2,5-DKPs. For instance, the N-2 position
has been used as an anchor for the design of conjugated molecules
between integrin ligands and paclitaxel for the synthesis of antitumor
agents.14 In some 2,5-DKPs-based compounds
such as chaetocin A15 or E- and N-cadherin
inhibitors,16 the C-3 position is functionalized
by an amido or alcohol groups. Therefore, in the strategy described
herein, we have studied the possibility to introduce in this position
both hydroxy- or amino-methyl groups as a starting point for the elongation
of an O-alkyl or peptidic chains. The aminomethyl moiety was readily
obtained from an azide derivative, which also allowed the formation
of triazole rings. The latter are appealing in medicinal chemistry
because they have been described as mimics of transoid amide bond
which, like the aza-DKP backbone, allows to increase the metabolic
stability of the synthetized molecules while maintaining biological
features.17

Figure 1 General structure of
novel bicyclic aza-DKPs and selected examples
of known biologically active 2,5-DKPs.

Thereby, we herein report an unprecedented strategy for selective
diversification of aza-DKPs to rapidly access mono- or disubstituted
aza-DKPs. The strategy relies on the preparation of two aza-DKP bicyclic
scaffolds encompassing at C-3 position either a hydroxymethyl (5) or an azidomethyl (8) moiety (Figure 2). Thereafter, subsequent functionalization
of these two scaffolds was evaluated and allowed access to N-acyl-,
triazole-, or amido-substituted aza-DKPs. To introduce a second point
of diversification, the alkylation at N-2 was also investigated, leading
to novel difunctionalized aza-DKPs. We anticipate that the strategy
described herein will be useful to facilitate the parallel synthesis
of complex aza-DKPs to enrich the chemical diversity of the existing
chemical libraries.

to functionalize.

Results and Discussion
To access scaffolds 5 and 8 displaying
two sites of potential derivatization, we envisioned a straightforward
synthetic approach starting from N-protected-O-benzyl-l-serine
methyl ester (Figure 2). The key step of the process is based on the preparation of the
allyl-substituted aza-DKP precursor8 enabling
the straightforward synthesis of the desired bicyclic aza-DKP scaffolds
by cyclohydrocarbonylation reaction.9

Bicyclic
Alcohol Functionalized Aza-DKP 5
To readily
access this scaffold, the α-amino group of the commercially
available O-benzyl-l-serine methyl ester was protected with
the acid-sensitive p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting
group through a reductive amination in the presence of p-methoxybenzaldehyde leading to alkylated amino ester 1 in 91% yield (Scheme 1). The latter was then reacted with bis(trichloromethyl)-carbonate
and allyl t-butyl carbazate 2, obtained
in one step from commercially available t-butyl carbazate,
to provide semicarbazide intermediate. The subsequent N-Boc deprotection
and cyclization were then attempted by treating crude semicarbazide
with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/H2O (95:5). Unfortunately,
in these conditions, only the products arising from the simultaneous
N-Boc and N-PMB deprotections were observed without ulterior cyclization.
This result is consistent with our previous findings that demonstrated
the necessity of starting from N-alkylated linear semicarbazide to
initiate the cyclization toward aza-DKP.8 Similar result was obtained in diluted acidic conditions (5% of
TFA in dichloromethane (DCM)), attesting the highly acid-sensitive
character of the PMB-protecting group. To circumvent this issue, a
boiling-water-catalyzed neutral N-Boc cleavage method was applied.18 The crude semicarbazide was dissolved in a mixture
H2O/1,4-dioxane (6:1) and heated to reflux for 18 h. Under
these conditions, N-Boc group was removed selectively and the cyclization
occurred spontaneously to provide aza-DKP 3 in 67% overall
yield (two steps from 1).

Scheme 1 Preparation of Aza-DKP
Scaffolds 5 and 8
The allyl derivative 3 was then submitted
to a Rh(I)-catalyzed
cyclohydrocarbonylation (CHC) process to readily access bicyclic aza-DKP 4. As previously reported, the CHC was performed under classical
conditions, i.e., the use of syngas (H2/CO) in the presence
of Rh(I) catalyst, BiPhePhos, and CSA in tetrahydrofuran (THF).9 However, in these conditions, a mixture of the
desired bicyclic derivative 4 and the hydroxylated intermediate
at C-6 position were obtained. Then, to facilitate the purification
and to increase the yield of the reaction, the subsequent conversion
of the hydroxyl derivative into aza-DKP 4 was attempted.
However, regardless of the time, the temperature or the nature of
the acid (CSA or PPTS), the full conversion of alcohol intermediate
into aza-DKP 4 was never observed. To circumvent this
limitation, we then envisaged a two-step process that involved the
methoxylated derivative at the C-6 position and its subsequent elimination
under acidic condition to provide the desired enamide 4. Therefore, the Rh(I)-catalyzed cyclohydrocarbonylation of aza-DKP 3 was achieved in MeOH/THF (10:1), leading to the methoxylated
derivative at the C-6 position, which was directly subjected to acidic
conditions (PPTS) to give exclusively the enamide 4 in
71% yield. Finally, the simultaneous reduction of the alkene and the
removal of the benzyl-protecting group were performed by catalytic
hydrogenolysis of 4 in the presence of Pearlman’s
catalyst. Thereby, scaffold 5 was obtained in excellent
yield (95%), ready to be further functionalized.

Bicyclic Azido
Functionalized Aza-DKP 8
To design original
aza-DKPs via both click chemistry and reduction/N-acylation
sequence from an azido derivative, aza-DKP scaffold 8 was efficiently obtained in a three-step process starting from bicyclic
compound 5 (Scheme 1). The primary alcohol was first converted into the
tosylate 6 followed by nucleophilic substitution in the
presence of NaN3 providing azido 7 in excellent
yield (93%). The PMB group was then easily removed from 7 by heating at 40 °C in TFA/H2O/TIS (95:2.5:2.5)
to give the deprotected aza-DKP 8 in good yield (79%),
ready to react via a copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition.

The efficient and robust process herein developed led to the synthesis
of both scaffolds 5 and 8 in 41% overall
yield (five steps) and 28% overall yield (eight steps), respectively.
Noteworthy, this process was readily amenable to gram-scale production
of both platforms for their subsequent functionalization.

Attempts To
Functionalize Aza-DKP Scaffold 5
We then turned
our attention to the diversification of both scaffolds 5 and 8. First, we examined the reactivity of
primary alcohol 5 toward classical O-alkylation conditions
(Scheme 2). The use
of NaH or inorganic bases (K2CO3, Cs2CO3) in the presence of alkylating agent (allyl bromide
or iodomethyl-cyclopentane) failed to provide the desired alkylated
analogues. Regardless of the tested conditions, only the dehydration
reaction was observed, leading to alkene 9 quasi-quantitatively.19 To avoid dehydration reaction, the alkylation
of 5 was tested under base-free conditions by employing
silver salts (Ag2O) and alkyl halide in DCM.20 However, alcohol 5 proved to be
unreactive toward these conditions (results not shown).

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of Dehydroalanine-Containing Aza-DKP 9 from
Aza-DKP 5 and 6
The alkylation was then envisaged following a Mitsunobu
reaction.
Compound 5 was reacted with PPh3 and DIAD
in the presence of 4-fluorophenol in THF. Unfortunately, as observed
above, alkene 9 was quantitatively obtained. Finally,
we tried an alternative strategy through tosylate derivative 6, obtained during the synthesis of scaffold 8. However, the reaction of 4-methoxyl phenol in the presence of NaH
or Cs2CO3 in dimethylformamide (DMF) led exclusively
to the dehydroalanine derivative 9. Taken together, these
results demonstrate that the O-alkylation of serine system in the
presence of a strong base or via alcohol activation remains difficult
due to the high propensity of the α-proton (H-3) to undergo
elimination. However, it is noteworthy that dehydroalanine-containing
aza-DKP 9 could be a useful substrate for further functionalization
including Michael addition as well as chemoselective ligation.21

Derivatization of Aza-DKP Scaffold 8 via Click
Chemistry
Owing to the difficulty to functionalize platform 5, we then focused our attention on the derivatization of
aza-DKP scaffold 8 under copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition conditions (CuAAC) to introduce a triazole moiety as
a bioisostere of the amide bond (Scheme 3).17 Treatment
of azido 8 with CuSO4, sodium ascorbate, and
phenylacetylene in THF/H2O (1:0.8) at 25 °C for 4
h led to triazole-substituted aza-DKP 10a in excellent
yield (95%). This reaction was also successfully applied to other
terminal alkynes substituted by heteroaryl group including thiophene
and pyridine providing triazoles 10b and 10c in 95 and 76% yields, respectively.

Scheme 3 Functionalization
of Aza-DKP Scaffold 8
Derivatization of Aza-DKP Scaffold 8 via Reduction
and Subsequent N-Acylation
Taking advantage of the azido
moiety, a first functionalization was envisaged following a two-step
reduction/acylation process (Scheme 3). Therefore, azide 8 was submitted to
catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of H2/Pd in MeOH
to provide amine intermediate quantitatively, which was straight way
engaged in the N-acylation step after a simple filtration to remove
the catalyst. Thereby, the primary amine was easily coupled with acyl
chloride bearing aromatic and aliphatic groups affording amides 11a–c with yields ranging from 77 to 93%.
To enrich the chemical diversity around bicyclic aza-DKPs, commercially
available amino acid building blocks including Boc-(l)- and
Boc-(d)-phenylalanine were also introduced via acylation
under classical peptidic coupling conditions to provide diastereomers 11d and 11e in good yields (84 and 96%, respectively).
These examples supplied information on the potential epimerization
at the C-3 position all along the synthesis of azido 8, as only diastereomers 11d and 11e were
obtained with only slight erosion of enantioselectivity (dr ratio
94:6 and 93:7, respectively). Finally, to envision the functionalization
at N-2 position before the acylation of the primary amino group, the
latter was efficiently protected by tert-butoxycarbonyl
group in the presence of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate
(11f, 94%).

N-Alkylation of Monofunctionalized Aza-DKP 11a
Aiming to access difunctionalized scaffolds,
the reactivity of
free nitrogen-containing aza-DKP (N-2) toward N-alkylation conditions
was then explored starting from N-acylated compound 11a. Various bases including K2CO3, Cs2CO3, t-BuOK, or BEMP were evaluated in
the presence of propargyl bromide in DMF and using tetrabutylammonium
iodide (TBAI). As previously reported by Luthman et al. for the N-alkylation
of free nitrogen-containing 2,5-DKPs, best conditions were obtained
using the sterically hindered iminophosporane base (i.e., BEMP).22 Thereby, after 4 h at room temperature, the
propargylic derivative 12a was isolated in 75% yield
(Scheme 4). To evaluate
the scope and limitation of the reaction, these conditions were then
applied to diverse alkylating agents (R group, Scheme 4). Compared to the more reactive propargyl
bromide, the alkylation of aza-DKP 11a with n-butyl bromide (12b) and Boc-aminopropyl bromide (12c) was sluggish, with only a partial conversion of 11a in a nearly 1:1 ratio after 6 h at room temperature for
both alkylating agents. Whereas the extension of reaction times or
heating did not improve the conversion of 11a, the addition
of 3 equiv of base and alkyl bromide proved to be beneficial and led
to compounds 12b and 12c in 62 and 60% yields,
respectively. Nevertheless, the reaction performed in the presence
of sterically demanding isobutyl bromide led to a lower yield after
48 h regardless of the amount of base and alkyl bromide (12d, 10%). This low-yield alkylation can be ascribed to the steric hindrance
of isobutyl bromide along with its propensity to undergo dehydrohalogenation
(−HX) in the presence of base. Finally, the 4-fluorobenzyl
group was introduced efficiently under the same conditions without
the need of additional base or alkylating agent providing compound 12e in excellent yield (89%).

Scheme 4 Access to Disubstituted
Aza-DKPs by N-Alkylation of Scaffold 11a
Overall, this methodology allows access to novel
disubstituted
bicyclic aza-DKPs bearing functionalities such as propargyl or amino
groups able to react with various commercial building blocks to further
extend the chemical diversity of this scaffold. Noteworthy, this is
a rare example of alkylation of secondary amine containing aza-urea
moiety.23

Conclusions
In
this article, we described an efficient and versatile approach
for selective diversification of mono- and disubstituted bicyclic
aza-DKPs to enlarge the chemical diversity accessible around this
scaffold. The synthetic route involved azido scaffold 8 obtained in eight steps in 28% overall yield from the commercially
available O-benzyl-l-serine methyl ester.
Then, we took advantage of the double reactivity of the azido moiety
to access various unprecedented aza-heterocycles such as (1) triazole-containing
aza-DKPs and (2) acylated aza-DKPs obtained after the reduction of
the azido function and subsequent N-acylation. To prepare disubstituted
scaffolds, we have evaluated the possibility to alkylate the benzoylated
intermediate. The use of sterically hindered iminophosporane base
allowed us to generate various disubstituted bicyclic aza-DKPs. All
attempts to alkylate scaffold 5 having led to the formation
of the dehydroalanine 9, it will be interesting to evaluate
the reactivity of this new compound with various nucleophiles.

dropwise (over 10 min) a solution of 1 (1.00 g, 3.04
mmol, 1 equiv) and DIEA (0.578 mL, 3.34 mmol, 1.1 equiv) in a mixture
of anhydrous THF/DCM (2:1, 12 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 25 min. A solution of 2 (0.549
g, 3.19 mmol, 1.05 equiv) and DIEA (0.578 mL, 3.34 mmol, 1.1 equiv)
in anhydrous THF (6 mL) was then added dropwise and the mixture was
heated at 40 °C overnight. The mixture was evaporated in vacuo,
partitioned between EtOAc (150 mL) and H2O (50 mL), and
the aqueous layer was re-extracted twice with EtOAc (2 × 150
mL). The combined organic layers were washed successively with an
aqueous solution of citric acid (5%, 100 mL), a saturated solution

tert-Butyl-(S)-((1,4-dioxooctahydropyridazino[1,2-a][1,2,4]triazin-3-yl)methyl)-carbamate (11f)
To a solution of 8 (0.100 g, 0.446 mmol,
1 equiv) in dry MeOH (5 mL) was added 10 wt % Pd on carbon (10 mg)
under argon. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature
under a hydrogen atmosphere for 3 h. The reaction mixture was filtered
over a pad of Celite, which was washed twiced with MeOH (2 ×
10 mL). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the resulting residue
was straight away engaged in the next step. To a solution of the crude
mixture in dry DCM (5 mL) was added Boc2O (0.114 mL, 0.533
mmol, 1.2 equiv) at room temperature under argon. The reaction mixture
was stirred at this temperature for 1 h under argon. The resulting
mixture was diluted with DCM (20 mL) and H2O (10 mL) and
the aqueous layer was extracted three times with DCM (3 × 15
mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (30 mL), dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo.
