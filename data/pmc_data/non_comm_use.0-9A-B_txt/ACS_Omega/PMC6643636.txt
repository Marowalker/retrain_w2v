Removal
of chloride from CoCl2 with TlPF6 in acetonitrile,
followed by addition of excess nitrosobenzene,
yielded the eight-coordinate cobalt(II) complex salt [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2, shown by single-crystal X-ray
analysis to have a distorted tetragonal geometry. The analogous treatment
of the bipyridyl complex Co(bpy)Cl2 yielded the mixed-ligand
cobalt(II) complex salt [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2, whose single-crystal X-ray structure displays
a trigonal prismatic geometry, similar to that of the iron(II) cation
in the previously known complex salt [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3](FeCl4)2. The use of TlPF6 to generate
solvated metal complex cations from chloride salts or chlorido complexes,
followed by the addition of nitrosobenzene, is shown to be a useful
synthetic strategy for the preparation of azodioxide complex cations
with the noncoordinating, diamagnetic PF6– counteranion. Coordination number appears to be more important than d electron count in determining the geometry and metal–ligand
bond distances of diphenylazodioxide complexes.

Introduction
In addition to nitric
oxide itself,1 organic derivatives of nitric
oxide have been studied as ligands
for transition metals.2 Nitrosobenzene
(PhNO), the prototypic nitrosoarene, exists as the dimer cis-Ph(O)NN(O)Ph in the solid state but is primarily monomeric in solution.3 Nevertheless, solution-phase chemistry has been
used to prepare complexes of metals with Ph(O)NN(O)Ph as a chelating
ligand. Structurally characterized examples include the Fe(II) complex
cation salt [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3](FeCl4)2, prepared by Nicholas and co-workers,4 and the Ca(II) complex salt [Ca{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}(H2O)2(THF)3]I2, from Hanusa and co-workers.5 In addition, Whiting and co-workers have prepared
and characterized the related neutral Sc(III) diarylazodioxide complex
[Sc{Ar(O)NN(O)Ar}(H2O)2(OTf)3], where Ar = 2-methoxyphenyl and Tf = SO2CF3.6

Structural measurements
of both free3 and Fe(II)-coordinated4b Ph(O)NN(O)Ph
indicate significant π-delocalized character and suggest the
possibility that it may behave as a redox-active ligand, such as 2,2′-bipyridyl
(bpy)7 or the catecholate/semiquinone ligands
studied by Pierpont and co-workers.8 Resonance
structures of cis-Ph(O)NN(O)Ph illustrating this
delocalization are shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Resonance Structures of cis-Ph(O)NN(O)Ph
The presence of the paramagnetic
Fe(III) anion FeCl4– in Nicholas’
azodioxide complex salt [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3](FeCl4)2 presented difficulties
for the investigation of the cation’s electronic structure
via magnetic measurements or electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.4b As transition metal complexes of redox-active
ligands have been used to catalyze a variety of organic reactions,9 we were motivated to investigate the synthesis
of azodioxide complex cations with diamagnetic, redox-stable counteranions,
both homoleptic species analogous to Nicholas’ compound and
heteroleptic complexes containing both Ph(O)NN(O)Ph and the known
redox-active ligand bpy.

Results and Discussion
In hopes
of isolating azodioxide complex cations with diamagnetic,
redox-stable counteranions, we wished to remove Cl– from the reaction mixture, to avoid the formation of paramagnetic
complex anions with chlorido ligands, of the form MClxy-. Winfield and
co-workers10 generated the salt [Fe(NCMe)6](PF6)2 by the treatment of FeF2 with PF5 in acetonitrile. Based on this result,
we sought to prepare acetonitrile-solvated metal cations M(NCMe)62+ with the PF6– counterion in situ and then displace coordinated acetonitrile with
diphenylazodioxide. In contrast to Winfield’s strategy, we
prepared M(NCMe)62+ by removal of Cl– from chloride salts: suspensions of anhydrous metal chlorides MCl2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) in acetonitrile were treated with stoichiometric
amounts of TlPF6 in solution to precipitate Cl– as insoluble TlCl, followed by the addition of a PhNO solution with
stirring to displace coordinated acetonitrile.

Thus far, Co
is the only metal to yield a crystallographically
characterizable azodioxide complex in this type of reaction: after
stirring at room temperature for 12 to 48 h, filtration of the reaction
mixture and removal of acetonitrile solvent from the filtrate in vacuo, followed by recrystallization from dichloromethane/hexane,
yielded black crystals of the novel Co azodioxide complex [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 (Scheme 2). Based on UV–visible spectroscopy,
some residual PhNO (in the solid state, its dimer) remains after recrystallization,
and elemental (CHN) analysis suggests the presence of a material with
a lower mass percentage of carbon, likely [Co(NCMe)6](PF6)2. Traces of TlCl or TlPF6 in the product
may also result in lower mass percentages of carbon, hydrogen, and
nitrogen, given the high atomic mass of thallium. A somewhat purer
product, with CHN values closer to (though still notably different
from) the theoretical ones, can be obtained by selecting the larger
crystals formed in the recrystallization step, leaving behind the
more powdery and less pure coprecipitate. Because of the presence
of some impurities, the yield, molar absorptivities, and magnetic
moment reported below for this compound are estimates only.

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2
In contrast with Nicholas’
six-coordinate, trigonal prismatic
[Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3]2+, the Co complex cation
[Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4]2+ is eight-coordinate, with
a roughly tetragonal coordination geometry. A coordination number
of 8 is very unusual for Co(II). The only monometallic, eight-coordinate
Co(II) complexes thus far characterized are dodecahedral (Ph4As)2[Co(NO3)4], prepared by Bergman
and Cotton,11 dodecahedral [CoL2](ClO4)2, where L = 2,11-diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane,
prepared by Krüger and co-workers,12 and the crown ether complex cations [Co(12-crown-4)2]2+ and [Co(benzo-12-crown-4)2]2+, prepared
as salts of various polyiodide anions by Meyer and co-workers,13 both of which display square antiprismatic coordination.

The [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4]2+ cation has a distorted
tetragonal coordination geometry, with idealized C4 symmetry assuming free N-phenyl bond rotation (Figure 1). Table 1 shows that the average N–N
and N–O bond lengths in [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4]2+ are similar to those observed in free Ph(O)NN(O)Ph, [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3]2+, and [Ca{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}(H2O)2(THF)3]2+, though the N–N bond
lengths in the complexes are slightly shorter than those in free Ph(O)NN(O)Ph.
The Co–O bond lengths in [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4]2+ are significantly longer than the Fe–O bond lengths
in [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3]2+ but considerably shorter
than the Ca–O (azodioxide) bond lengths in [Ca{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}(H2O)2(THF)3]2+. The chelate
rings in [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4]2+ are not planar,
instead assuming a puckered “envelope” conformation
with the Co atom lying outside of the plane of the N and O atoms,
in contrast to the Fe and Ca complexes, which both contain planar
chelate rings.

The similarity in metrical parameters for free Ph(O)NN(O)Ph
and
Ph(O)NN(O)Ph coordinated to Fe or Co suggests that the electronic
environment of this species does not vary drastically upon coordination.
The significant difference in metal–ligand bond lengths between
[Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3]2+ and [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4]2+ is thus proposed to be primarily due to steric,
as opposed to electronic, reasons: the Co–O bonds are elongated
to accommodate a larger number of ligands around the Co(II) center.
The still greater Ca–O bond length in seven-coordinate [Ca{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}(H2O)2(THF)3]2+ may reflect
a greater ion-dipole component to the bonding of Ph(O)NN(O)Ph to an
alkaline earth metal, compared to the greater covalent character of
its bonding to transition metals with valence d orbitals.

The IR spectrum of [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 is also indicative of similarities between free
and bound Ph(O)NN(O)Ph. Lüttke14 studied the N–O stretching frequencies of azodioxides and
found that aromatic trans-azodioxides display N–O
stretching frequencies between 1248 and 1299 cm–1, while aromatic cis-azodioxides display two N–O
stretching frequencies each between 1342 and 1409 cm–1. In our hands, the IR spectrum of solid cis-Ph(O)NN(O)Ph
(obtained in ATR mode) shows a strong, broad band at 1390 cm–1 and two weaker bands at 1458 and 1485 cm–1, the
latter of which may be due to C–C stretching within the phenyl
rings. In contrast, [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 displays a somewhat less strong, broad band at 1370 cm–1 and weaker bands at 1460 and 1484 cm–1. The similarity of the N–O stretching frequencies between
free and bound Ph(O)NN(O)Ph is consistent with a fairly small effect
of coordination on the electronics of the ligand. Further evidence
for this small effect consists of the observation by Nicholas and
co-workers4b of bands at 1374, 1462, and
1481 cm–1 in the IR spectrum of [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3](FeCl4)2.

The UV–visible
absorption spectrum of [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 in acetonitrile shows peaks
with λmax values of 293 nm (ε = 4.03 ×
104 M–1·cm–1)
and 305 nm (ε = 4.62 × 104 M–1·cm–1). An additional peak with λmax = 282 nm (ε = 5.36 × 104 M–1·cm–1) may be due to residual PhNO as an impurity,
as the UV–visible spectrum of pure PhNO in acetonitrile displays
a strong peak at this wavelength. Residual PhNO may also give rise
to the peak at 285 nm in the UV–visible spectrum of [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3](FeCl4)2 as measured by Nicholas’
group.4b The Beer–Lambert law plots
for absorbance vs concentration at each peak wavelength were linear,
suggesting that the Ph(O)NN(O)Ph ligands do not dissociate in solution
to a significant extent, as such dissociation would be expected to
be concentration-dependent.

The magnetic susceptibility of [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 was measured at 22 °C,
and an effective
magnetic moment of 3.81 μB was calculated using the
list of diamagnetic corrections compiled by Bain and Berry.15 This value is near the 3.87 μB predicted for a complex with three unpaired electrons assuming spin-only
contributions to the magnetic moment, consistent with a Co(II) complex.
The presence of some residual PhNO dimer, a diamagnetic compound,
likely leads to a lower apparent magnetic moment than the true value
for [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2.

After preparing the homoleptic azodioxide complex [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2, we sought to prepare
a complex containing both Ph(O)NN(O)Ph and the known redox-active
ligand bpy. We chose the tetrahedral Co(II) complex Co(bpy)Cl2, whose preparation was reported by Iqbal and co-workers,16 as a synthon for a heteroleptic bpy/azodioxide
complex. Treatment of this blue complex with 2 equiv of TlPF6 in acetonitrile to remove Cl– as insoluble TlCl,
followed by addition of excess PhNO, yields the six-coordinate complex
cation salt [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2 (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2
Filtration of the
reaction mixture of Scheme 3, followed by removal of acetonitrile solvent in vacuo and recrystallization from dichloromethane/diethyl
ether yielded garnet-red crystals of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2 suitable for analysis by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Thermal ellipsoid plot
of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2, with thermal ellipsoids drawn to 50% probability
and hydrogen atoms removed for clarity. Molecules of the recrystallization
solvent dichloromethane are present in the lattice.

We propose that the reaction proceeds by initial
replacement of
Cl– by solvent to form [Co(bpy)(NCMe)n]2+, where n = 2 or 4,
based on the immediate appearance of a peach color upon addition of
TlPF6 to the blue Co(bpy)Cl2. This is notably
different from the light pink color observed upon addition of TlPF6 to a solution of the simple salt CoCl2 in acetonitrile,
suggesting that bpy remains coordinated to the Co(II) center prior
to the addition of PhNO.

The [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2]2+ cation has
a trigonal prismatic geometry, similar to [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3]2+, with idealized C2v symmetry assuming free N–phenyl bond rotation. Table 1 shows that the N–N
and N–O bond lengths in [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2]2+ are similar to those in free Ph(O)NN(O)Ph and other diarylazodioxide
complexes. Interestingly, the Co–O bond lengths in this complex
are very close to the Fe–O bond lengths in [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3]2+, despite the differing d electron
counts of the transition metals in these complexes: d6 for Fe(II) and d7 for Co(II).
However, the average metal–azodioxide oxygen bond length does
increase significantly from these six-coordinate complexes to the
seven-coordinate, d0 complex [Sc{Ar(O)NN(O)Ar}(H2O)2(OSO2CF3)] and the
eight-coordinate, d7 complex [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4]2+. The number of crystallographically characterized
azodioxide complexes remains small, thus making it difficult to determine
a general trend, but from the limited number of structures known,
coordination number, rather than metal or d electron
count, seems to be the primary determinant of metal–ligand
bond distance in azodioxide complexes, with the seven-coordinate,
alkaline earth complex [Ca{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}(H2O)2(THF)3]2+ an exception, as mentioned
above.

The trigonal prismatic coordination geometry of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2 is very unusual for cobalt.
Most previously reported monometallic, trigonal prismatic cobalt complexes
contain complicated, hexadentate ligands, such as clathrochelates17 or pseudoclathrochelates.18 To the best of our knowledge, the only other structurally
characterized trigonal prismatic cobalt complexes containing only
bidentate ligands are the semiquinone complexes Co(NO2phen)(3,6-DBSQ)2 and Co(dafl)(3,6-DBSQ)2, where 3,6-DBSQ = 3,6-di-tert-butylsemiquinone, NO2phen = 5-nitro-1,10-phenanthroline,
and dafl = 4,5-diaza-fluoren-9-one.8d

Considerable experimental and theoretical work has been done on
trigonal prismatic transition metal complexes, particularly d0 species. The famous permethyl species W(CH3)6, whose synthesis was first reported in 1973,19 was initially proposed to display octahedral
coordination geometry,20 but its solid-state
structure was later determined to be a distorted trigonal prism with C3v symmetry.21 Its gas-phase structure was also shown to be a trigonal
prism, with either C3v or D3h symmetry.22 The adoption of non-VSEPR trigonal prismatic
geometries by six-coordinate d0 complexes
has been studied computationally at various levels of theory.23

Albright and co-workers23a developed
a theoretical rationale for d0 non-VSEPR
structures, using the hypothetical CrH6 molecule as a model
system. They showed that, in the Oh geometry, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs), t1u-symmetry bonding combinations
of metal p orbitals with hydrogen, are close in energy
to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs), t2g-symmetry nonbonding metal dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals. These two sets of frontier orbitals can mix via
a second-order Jahn–Teller effect to yield a trigonal prismatic D3h geometry, in which two occupied
MOs are stabilized relative to Oh. Further distortion to C3v symmetry allows for additional stabilization. While the calculations
of Albright and co-workers predicted that a D3h structure would be more stable for W(CH3)6 than C3v, later calculations by Kaupp,23b which accounted for electron correlation, did predict a ground-state C3 structure for W(CH3)6, with the WC6 heavy-atom skeleton displaying C3v symmetry, consistent with
experiment.21

The observed trigonal
prismatic geometry of this compound and [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3](FeCl4)2 may be understood in light
of the fact that cis-azodioxides are isolobal, by
the analogy of Hoffmann,24 with dithiolene
dianions R2C2S22–. Transition metal tris(dithiolene) complexes M(S2C2R2)3, where M is a metal from group
5, 6, or 7, and which can be neutral, cationic, or anionic, are known
to frequently display trigonal prismatic coordination,25 and the relative energy orderings of their MOs
are dependent on the identity of the metal and the charge of the complex,
due to the heavily metal–ligand delocalized character of the
MOs. Depending on the metal and charge, a dithiolene ligand may be
considered as the closed-shell dianion R2C2S22–, the radical monoanion R2C2S2–, or the neutral, closed-shell
species R2C2S2. Similarly, one may
envision that formally neutral Ph(O)NN(O)Ph may behave, in certain
complexes, as the radical monocation [Ph(O)NN(O)Ph]+ or
the closed-shell dication [Ph(O)NN(O)Ph]2+. Theoretical
studies of the electronic structures of [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3]2+ and [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2]2+ are currently in progress to clarify the character of Ph(O)NN(O)Ph
in these complexes.

The infrared spectrum of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2 shows a set of overlapping peaks
in the N–O
stretching region,14 with greatest intensity
at 1370 cm–1, 1444 cm–1, and 1478
cm–1. It is similar in this respect to the IR spectra
of free cis-Ph(O)NN(O)Ph, [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2, and [Fe{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}3](FeCl4)2,4b all of which display
a strong peak between 1370 and 1390 cm–1 and two
less intense peaks between 1458 and 1485 cm–1, though
for [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2, the lowest-frequency peak in this region is no longer the most
intense.

The UV–visible absorption spectra of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2 in acetonitrile show two peaks,
with λmax values of 246 nm (ε = 1.38 ×
104 M–1·cm–1)
and 304 nm (ε = 2.26 × 104 M–1·cm–1). The peak at 304 nm is in a very similar
position to that observed for [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 at 305 nm and may reflect charge transfer between
the Co center and the azodioxide. The peak at 246 nm likely corresponds
to a bpy ligand-centered π → π* transition, as
the UV–visible spectra of free bpy in acetonitrile show a peak
at 237 nm (ε = 2.78 × 104 M–1·cm–1).

The magnetic susceptibility
of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2 was measured at 22 °C, and an
effective magnetic moment of 4.74 μB was calculated.
This value is in the range of magnetic moments commonly observed for
Co(II) complexes with three unpaired electrons.26 An orbital angular momentum contribution to the magnetic
moment is clearly present, as the spin-only magnetic moment predicted
for a complex with three unpaired electrons would be only 3.87 μB. Octahedral and tetrahedral Co(II) complexes are well-known
to have substantial orbital angular momentum contributions to their
magnetic moments,27 and the trigonal prismatic
Co(II) complex [Co(PccBF)](BF4), where PccBF– is the hexadentate ligand fluoroborotris(2-carboxaldoximo-6-pyridyl)phosphine,
has been shown to have a solid-state magnetic moment of 4.91 μB.28

Conclusion
The
eight-coordinate cobalt complex salt [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 and the trigonal-prismatic [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2 have been prepared and structurally
characterized. Theoretical work is in progress to gain further insight
into the electronic structure of these new cobalt complexes with unusual
coordination geometry. Further experimental work will focus on the
examination of the mixed bpy/azodioxide complex for possible redox
activity and catalytic ability.

Methods
General Experimental
Considerations
Unless otherwise
indicated, operations were performed under anhydrous and anaerobic
conditions (a dry nitrogen atmosphere), using standard Schlenk line
and glovebox (MBraun Labstar Pro) techniques. Glassware was dried
in an oven at 160 °C prior to use. NMR spectra were acquired
using a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer. Infrared spectra data
were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 2 spectrometer, with the samples
as neat solids, in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. UV–visible
spectra were obtained in acetonitrile solution in gastight cuvettes
(path length 1.2 cm) on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer. Magnetic
susceptibility measurements were performed using a Sherwood Scientific
MK 1 magnetic susceptibility balance. Elemental analysis was performed
by Galbraith Laboratories, Inc. (Knoxville, TN). Nondeuterated solvents
were deoxygenated by sparging with dry nitrogen and then dried via
passage through activated alumina in an MBraun MB-SPS solvent purification
system. CD3CN was degassed via the freeze–pump–thaw
method and dried over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. Reagents
were obtained from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher, Strem,
TCI) and used without further purification.

Safety Note
These
synthetic procedures involve the
use of thallium(I) hexafluorophosphate (TlPF6). Thallium
compounds are highly toxic when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through
the skin. While the syntheses described are performed in a glovebox
or sealed Schlenk tube, due to the air-sensitivity of nitrosobenzene
and the cobalt complex products, extreme caution should be taken when
disposing of thallium-containing waste material in a fume hood.

Synthesis of [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2
In the glovebox, 0.206 g (1.58 mmol) anhydrous CoCl2 was suspended in 30 mL acetonitrile and stirred. To this
stirred suspension was added a solution of 1.11 g (3.17 mmol) TlPF6 in 5 mL acetonitrile. A white precipitate of TlCl was immediately
observed, along with the appearance of a light pink color in solution.
After 15 min, a solution of 1.30 g (12.1 mmol) PhNO in 20 mL acetonitrile
was added, and the solution was stirred for 2 days at room temperature.
The reaction mixture was then filtered through a fritted-glass funnel
to remove TlCl, and solvent was removed from the filtrate under vacuum
to yield the crude product. The crude product was dissolved in a minimal
amount of dichloromethane and placed in the glovebox freezer at −30
°C overnight, after which some unreacted PhNO dimer crystallized.
The supernatant was removed from the PhNO dimer crystals and transferred
into another vessel. Hexane was gently layered on top of the supernatant,
and the mixture returned to the freezer for an additional 2.5 days,
yielding black crystals of [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 suitable for X-ray diffraction. The crystals were removed
with a spatula from a powdery coprecipitate and put under vacuum,
yielding 0.50 g [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 (0.41 mmol, 26%). UV–visible spectra in acetonitrile:
λmax (nm) (ε [M–1·cm–1]): 282 (5.36 × 104), 293 (4.03 ×
104), 305 (4.62 × 104). FT-IR spectrum
(solid-phase): ν (cm–1) 1484, 1460, 1370 (broad),
1167, 951, 833 (strong), 765, 690, 666, 557 (strong). Elemental analysis:
34.26% C, 2.79% H, 8.86% or 8.68% N (two measurements performed) (theoretical:
47.81% C, 3.34% H, 9.29% N).

Synthesis of Co(bpy)Cl2
The procedure reported
by Iqbal and co-workers16 was followed
with minor modification. In the glovebox, 1.57 g (9.92 mmol) 2,2′-bipyridyl
(bpy) was dissolved in 30 mL acetonitrile and stirred. To this stirred
solution was added 1.28 g (9.86 mmol) solid anhydrous CoCl2. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature,
during which time a blue precipitate formed. The solvent was removed
under vacuum, and the resulting blue powder was rinsed with diethyl
ether and dried under vacuum to yield the blue solid Co(bpy)Cl2 (0.74 g, 26%), used without further purification.

Synthesis
of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2
In the glovebox, 0.517 g (1.79 mmol) Co(bpy)Cl2 was suspended in 50 mL acetonitrile and stirred. To this
stirred suspension was added a solution of 1.31 g (3.75 mmol) TlPF6 in 10 mL acetonitrile. A white precipitate of TlCl was immediately
observed, concomitant with the appearance of a peach color in solution.
After 15 min, a solution of 1.15 g (10.7 mmol) PhNO in 25 mL acetonitrile
was added, and the mixture was stirred for 2.5 days at room temperature.
Further color changes during the course of the reaction were not observed
due to the deep green color of PhNO. The reaction mixture was then
filtered through a fritted-glass funnel to remove TlCl, and solvent
was removed from the filtrate under vacuum to yield the crude product.
The crude product was dissolved in a minimal amount of dichloromethane
and placed in the glovebox freezer at −30 °C for 1.5 days,
after which point unreacted PhNO dimer crystallized. The supernatant
was removed from the PhNO dimer crystals and transferred into another
vessel. Diethyl ether was gently layered on top of the supernatant,
and the mixture was returned to the freezer for 2.5 days, yielding
garnet-red crystals of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2 (0.25 g, 0.27 mmol, 15%). This paramagnetic
complex does not give visible peaks in its 1H NMR spectrum
(CD3CN). When such a spectrum is taken, small amounts of
free PhNO can be seen, as was confirmed by spiking experiments in
which additional PhNO was added to a sample of [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2. The level of this PhNO
impurity is not large, as no signals for PhNO can be observed in the
UV–visible or IR spectra under the peaks due to the main product.
UV–visible spectra: λmax (nm) (ε [M–1·cm–1]): 246 (1.38 × 104), 304 (2.26 × 104). FT-IR spectrum (solid-phase):
ν (cm–1) 3606 (broad), 3534 (broad), 2316,
2289, 1604, 1577 (weak), 1478, 1444, 1370 (broad), 1318, 1249 (weak),
1158, 1118 (weak), 1028, 954, 824 (strong), 766, 738, 689, 667, 652,
555 (strong). Elemental analysis: 38.81% C, 2.65% H, 10.29% N (theoretical:
43.75% C, 3.02% H, 9.00% N).

Spectral Analysis of PhNO
Commercial
PhNO was analyzed
by UV–visible spectroscopy in acetonitrile solution, and by
IR spectroscopy in the solid state, for comparison with the spectra
of the complexes [Co{Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}4](PF6)2 and [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2. Note that solid “PhNO” is actually predominantly
the dimer cis-Ph(O)NN(O)Ph, while in solution it
exists predominantly as the PhNO monomer.3 UV–visible spectra in acetonitrile: λmax (nm) (ε [M–1·cm–1]): 218 (1.25 × 105), 237 (8.70 × 103), 282 (1.69 × 105). FT-IR spectrum (solid-phase):
ν (cm–1) 3064, 1485, 1458, 1390 (strong, broad),
1191, 1158, 950 (strong), 924, 777 (strong), 761 (strong), 689 (strong),
665 (strong), 616, 590, 490.

Spectral Analysis of 2,2′-Bipyridyl
Commercial
2,2′-bipyridyl was analyzed by UV–visible spectroscopy
in acetonitrile, and by IR spectroscopy in the solid state, for comparison
with the UV–visible and IR spectra of the complex [Co(bpy){Ph(O)NN(O)Ph}2](PF6)2. UV–visible spectra
in acetonitrile: λmax (nm) (ε [M–1·cm–1]): 237 (2.78 × 104),
275 (2.44 × 104). FT-IR spectrum (solid phase): ν
(cm–1) 3055 (weak), 1739 (broad), 1578 (strong),
1558 (broad), 1451 (strong), 1415 (strong), 1250, 1139, 1084, 1054
(weak), 1040, 992, 894 (weak), 755 (strong), 653, 519 (strong).
