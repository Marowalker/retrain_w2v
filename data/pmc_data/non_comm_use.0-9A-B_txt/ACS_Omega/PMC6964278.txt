Janus kinases (JAKs) are enzymes
involved in signaling pathways
that affect hematopoiesis and immune cell functions. JAK1, JAK2, and
JAK3 play different roles in numerous diseases of the immune system
and have also been considered as potential targets for cancer therapy.
In the present study, the susceptibility of the oral JAK inhibitor
tofacitinib against these three JAKs was elucidated using the 500-ns
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations based
on MM-PB(GB)SA, QM/MM-GBSA (PM3 and SCC-DFTB), and SIE methods. The
obtained results revealed that tofacitinib could interact with all
JAKs at the ATP-binding site via electrostatic attraction, hydrogen
bond formation, and in particular van der Waals interaction. The conserved
glutamate and leucine residues (E957 and L959 of JAK1, E930 and L932
of JAK2, and E903 and L905 of JAK3) located in the hinge region stabilized
tofacitinib binding through strongly formed hydrogen bonds. Complexation
with the incoming tofacitinib led to a closed conformation of the
ATP-binding site and a decreased protein fluctuation at the glycine
loop of the JAK protein. The binding affinities of tofacitinib/JAKs
were ranked in the order of JAK3 > JAK2 ∼ JAK1, which are
in
line with the reported experimental data.

1 Introduction
Janus
kinases (JAKs) are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which are
classified into four members consisting of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2.
JAKs are involved in the growth, development, survival, and differentiation
of different types of cells. In particular, JAKs play a major role
in hematopoiesis and in controlling the cytokine-dependent immune
systems.1,2 Cytokine binding to its receptor activates
JAKs, which in turn phosphorylates tyrosine within the cytoplasmic
domain of the receptor, and then activates signal transducers and
activators of transcription (STAT), promoting dimerization and translocating
to the nucleus for turning on the gene expression.3,4 JAK1,
JAK2, and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed in lymphoid cells of mammals,
while JAK3 is expressed in hematopoietic cells.5,6 JAK1
is crucial for a different family of cytokine receptors employing
gp130 as a co-receptor.7,8 JAK2 is associated with hormone-like
cytokines, and it transduces signals through some interferons (IFNs)
and gp130-containing receptors. JAK3 is characterized by its exclusive
association with cytokine receptors that contain a common γ
chain (cc).9 JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 are potential
targets for the treatment of hematological disorders such as acute
leukemia, myeloproliferative disorder, and lymphoproliferative disorder,10−14 while TYK2 is involved in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases
such as a primary immunodeficiency hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome.15,16 In this work, we focus on hematological disorders, therefore only
JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 inhibitors are mentioned.

Dysregulated
JAK-STAT functionality can lead to various immune
diseases and cancers.17 Therefore, JAK1,
JAK2, and JAK3 have been characterized as attractive targets for the
development of anticancer drugs. The first-generation JAK inhibitors
(e.g., ruxolitinib and tofacitinib approved by the FDA for the treatment
of myeloproliferative and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively) bind
to the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain, blocking
several downstream signaling cascades.9 Ruxolitinib is a potent inhibitor for JAK1 and JAK2 by interfering
with the recruitment of STATs to cytokine receptors. Additionally,
tofacitinib has been reported to potentially inhibit JAK1/2/3 as well
as Tyk2 with even higher efficiency.9,18

The
complexation between tofacitinib and JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, and
JAK3) has been studied experimentally and theoretically. The three-dimensional
(3D) structures of JAK1 and JAK3 in complex with tofacitinib were
crystallized,19,20 while the X-ray structure of
JAK2 was co-crystalized with pyrrole-3-carboxamide.21 They have sequence identity from CLUSTALW22 in a range of 46–55% and sequence similarity of
61–71% (see Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information). By superimposition on the three complexes (Figure 1A), the active conformation
of JAKs, in which the activation loop (A loop) is closed into the
active site, is found in the ligand-bound form.9 The amino acid sequences in the glycine-rich loop (G loop),
hinge region, catalytic loop, and A loop are conserved to some extent
(Figure 1B). These
conserved regions have a sequence identity of 65–78% (Figure S1).22 The
proline residue in the hinge region of JAKs could introduce the rigidity
into this region.23 The half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of tofacitinib against JAKs was in
the range of 1.7–3.7, 1.8–4.1, and 0.75–1.6 nM
for JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3, respectively.20,24−26 On the other hand, another type of Janus kinase, TYK2, showed the
IC50 values for tofacitinib to be higher than the above-mentioned
three types of JAKs, with the values being 16 and 34 nM.26,27 The last 2 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that
the residues E903 and L905 of JAK3 strongly stabilize the tofacitinib
binding.28 The pharmacophore model of docked
tofacitinib with JAK3 showed one hydrogen bond (HB) donor, two HB
acceptors, and one hydrophobic interaction.29

binding at the active site of JAKs and its chemical structure (D).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the tofacitinib
susceptibility
(Figure 1C,D), including
binding patterns, intermolecular interactions, and binding affinity
against the three JAKs in terms of drug–target interaction
using MD simulations extensively performed up to 500 ns with three
randomly selected initial velocities (1.5 μs in total for each
complex). In addition, the protein motion of apo and holo forms of
JAK (without and with tofacitinib bound) was calculated using principal
component analysis (PCA). The obtained information could be used as
theoretical guidance for further developing novel anti-JAK(s) drug
candidates.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 System
Stability of Simulated Models
The stability of the tofacitinib/JAK
complexes was considered in
terms of root-mean-square displacement (RMSD, Figure 2) plotted along the simulation time of 500
ns. In each system, the RMSD results from the three independent simulations
showed similar patterns. The RMSD values of JAK1 and JAK2 complexes
continuously increased at the first 50 ns and stably maintained at
a fluctuation of ∼2.0–3.5 Å, whilst RMSD values
of JAK3 complexes continuously increased at 150 ns and maintained
at a fluctuation of ∼2.50–3.50 Å until the end
of simulation time. The change in the fluctuation pattern of JAK1
and JAK3 complexes was lower than that of JAK2. The RMSD value of
JAK2 was increased after 300 ns and reached equilibrium at ∼350
ns for simulations (run1 and run3). Although the situation was different
in run2, the high fluctuation was found in a similar pattern upon
simulation time. Thus, the last 150 ns MD trajectories of each system
(considered as an equilibrium state, which was also supported by the
number of hydrogen bonds and contact atoms involved in the drug–protein
interactions plotted upon simulation time in Supporting Information Figures S3 and S4) were used for further analysis.

initial velocities.

2.2 Key Binding
Residues
To investigate
the key binding amino acids involved in tofacitinib binding to the
three JAKs, the ΔGbind,residue calculations
based on the MM/GBSA method were performed on the 100 snapshots taken
from the last 150 ns of all simulations. The energy contributions
of a particular residue and drug orientation at the binding pocket
of the three focused JAKs are displayed in Figure 3. The negative and positive ΔGbind,residue values represent the ligand stabilization
and destabilization, respectively. The contributions from the residues
839–1045 in JAK1, 839–1000 in JAK2, and 815–990
in JAK3 are presented. Note that ΔGbind,residue values of tofacitinib binding with each JAK from the three independent
simulations were not significantly different.

the binding of tofacitinib from

inside the binding pocket drawn from the MD snapshot. The lowest and
highest energies are ranged from dark magenta to yellow, respectively.
The electrostatic and van der Waals (vdW) energy contributions are
given in (B) using the data derived from the average three independent
simulations.

The hydrophobic residues V889,
F958, L959, and L1010 of JAK1, V863
and L983 of JAK2, and V836 and L956 of JAK3 exhibited the energy contribution
of <−1.0 kcal/mol (Figure 3A). Interestingly, tofacitinib was strongly stabilized
by leucine residue located in the hinge region, in which the binding
energies were observed as follows: −1.92 ± 0.01 kcal/mol
from L959 of JAK1 (light pink), −1.66 ± 0.10 kcal/mol
from L932 of JAK2 (green), and −1.50 ± 0.27 kcal/mol from
L905 of JAK3 (green). In addition, L828 (green) and L956 (magenta)
from JAK3 gave the binding free energies lower than L855 (green) and
L983 (light magenta) from JAK2 as well as G882 (green) and L1010 (pink)
from JAK1. These findings agree well with a previous study reporting
that the two hydrophobic regions, pyrrolopyrimidine and piperidine
rings, of tofacitinib can tightly interact with L905, L956, and L828
of JAK3.28 It was mentioned that the hydrophobic
interaction plays an important role in tofacitinib/JAK1(3) complexation,
especially hydrophobic residues V889, F958, L959, and L1010 of JAK1.28,30,31 In agreement with these former
studies, our calculations revealed that the pyrrolopyrimidine and
piperidine rings of tofacitinib were sandwiched between the hydrophobic
residues of the N-terminal lobe, including (i) V889, A906, V938, and
F958 for JAK1, (ii) V863 and V911 for JAK2, and (iii) V836, V884,
L905, and A853 for JAK3. In addition, the methyl group of the piperidine
ring pointed toward the C-terminal lobe, making van der Waals contacts
with S963 and L959 for JAK1, L932 and S936 for JAK2, and C909 for
JAK3.

Apart from hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions
and hydrogen bond formations with the glutamate located in the hinge
region also played an important role in stabilizing tofacitinib. Strong
electrostatic contributions for drug binding were observed as follows:
−2.17 ± 0.03 kcal/mol from JAK1 E957 (light pink); −2.23
± 0.06 kcal/mol from JAK2 E930 (light pink); and −2.08
± 0.03 kcal/mol from JAK3 E903 (pink) (Figure 3A). As shown in Figure 3B, the electrostatic contribution (ΔEelec + ΔGsolv,polar) of E957 in JAK1, E930 in JAK2, and E903 in JAK3 showed the energy
contribution value less than van der Waals contribution (ΔEvdw + ΔGsolv,nonpolar). Since these glutamic residues in three types of JAKs are the acidic
amino acid, they can form interaction with some basic groups of pyrrolopyrimidine
and piperidine rings (such as imino group).28 The number of HBs of all systems along simulation times are summarized
in Figure S3. They exhibited very strong
HBs with the pyrrolopyrimidine core structure of tofacitinib as shown
in Figure 4A (99.9
± 0.0 and 94.8 ± 0.2% for JAK1 E957 and L959; 99.9 ±
0.0 and 89.7 ± 1.7% for JAK2 E930 and L932; 100 ± 0.0 and
80.9 ± 1.2% for JAK3 E903 and L905). This finding is consistent
with previous studies showing that E957 of JAK1, as well as E903 and
L905 residues of JAK3, played an important role in stabilizing the
core structure of pyrrolopyrimidine binding at the ATP-binding site.28,32 Moreover, the pyrrolopyrimidine core structure of the other first
analogues of the drug, including ruxolitinib,33 oclacitinib,34 and baricitinib35 was also strongly stabilized by hydrogen bonding
in the hinge region of JAKs in a manner similar to tofacitinib binding.36

Figure 4 Percentage of hydrogen bond occupation with the two important
residues,
glutamate, and leucine, in the hinge region of JAKs. The data were
derived from the last 150 ns of the three different simulations determined
using the criteria between the hydrogen bond donor (HD) and hydrogen
acceptor (HA) as follows: (i) ≤3.5 Å for distance and
(ii) ≥120° for the angle.

2.3 Solvent Accessibility and the Number of Surrounding
Atoms
To characterize the solvent accessibility toward the
ligand-binding pocket, the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)
calculation on the amino acid residues within the 3.5 Å sphere
of tofacitinib was performed. The obtained results are summarized
in Figure 5A. It can
be seen that the SASA values for the JAK1 and JAK2 complexes of ∼200–500
Å2 were somewhat higher than that for the JAK3 system
(by ∼100 Å2). Without drug binding (apo form),
more water molecules were detected at the active site as seen by enhanced
SASA values to ∼600–900 Å2 for JAK2/3
and ∼500–800 Å2 for JAK1. From the plot
of radial distribution function (RDF) in Supporting Information Figure S5, there are ∼0.9 and ∼0.5
water molecules stabilized by the N19 nitrogen of tofacitinib,
as seen by a sharp peak at 3.5 Å in JAK1 and a board peak at
3.3 Å in JAK1 and JAK2/3, respectively. A similar phenomenon
was found in the simulations of JAK1 and JAK3, including crystal waters
in the systems. Note that a water molecule was detected close to this
nitrogen in the crystal structures of tofacitinib/JAK1 and tofacitinib/JAK3
with a distance of 2.5 and 3.0 Å.

Figure 5 (A) SASA on the residues
and (B) number of surrounding atoms within
the 3.5 Å sphere of tofacitinib from the three independent simulations.

Furthermore, the number of surrounding atoms of
tofacitinib (using
the criteria of any atom within the 3.5 Å sphere of the ligand)
were counted. Figure 5B shows that the number of surrounding atoms around tofacitinib was
ranked in the order of JAK3 (∼18 atoms) > JAK1 ∼
JAK2
(∼15 atoms). For % occupation in the number of contact atoms
in Figure S6, in JAK2 and JAK3 tofacitinib
showed the contact atoms with all four conserved regions (G loop,
hinge, catalytic loop, and A loop), while no contact atom with the
catalytic loop was detected in JAK1. Instead, drug contacted with
K908 of JAK1 nearby the G loop (69%). Again, the glutamate and leucine
residues at the hinge region (JAK1 E957 and L959; JAK2 E930 and L932;
JAK3 E903 and L905) strongly supported the drug binding (>70%).
Interestingly,
all three atom types (carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen) of L828 in the
G loop and the oxygen atom of A966, the residue adjacent to the DFG
motif in the activation loop (Figure S1), could contact with tofacitinib in JAK3. The residue A966 has hydrophobicity
more than G993 in JAK2.36 These findings
suggested that the binding pocket residues in JAK3 were close-packed.
In other words, tofacitinib was deeply buried and fitted well in the
ATP-binding site of JAK3 greater than the others.

2.4 Binding Affinity of Tofacitinib
End-point
ΔGbind calculations with MM-PBSA,
MM-GBSA, QM/MM-GBSA (PM3 and SCC-DFTB methods treated on ligand atoms),
and solvated interaction energy (SIE) were applied to predict and
compare the binding affinity of tofacitinib/JAK complexes on the same
series of 100 MD snapshots used in ΔGbind,residue calculation. The ΔGbind values
averaged over the three different simulations are given in Table 1 in comparison to
the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of tofacitinib
from the previous studies.

b The inhibitory activities of tofacitinib
against the kinase activity of JAK2 and JAK3 from this study were
determined by the enzyme-based assay, where the IC50 curves
are shown in Figure S7.

Both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA approaches
gave the same order of ΔGbind as
follows: JAK3 (−19.04 and −24.47
kcal/mol) < JAK1 (−16.93 and −20.61 kcal/mol) ∼
JAK2 (−15.34 and −19.34 kcal/mol). Overall, the estimation
of binding affinity from the QM/MM-GBSA method is significantly better
than MM-GBSA.38 In our study, both PM3/MM-GBSA
and SCC-DFTB/MM-GBSA methods also gave the similar phenomena of binding
free energies with the MM/PB(GB)SA as ΔGbind of JAK3 (−26.88 and −40.15 kcal/mol) <
JAK1 (−21.69 and −31.75 kcal/mol) ∼ JAK2 (−18.24
and −28.55 kcal/mol). The ΔGbind results predicted from the SIE method also gave the highest binding
affinity for the tofacitinib/JAK3 complex. The obtained information
suggested that the drug could inhibit this protein target more efficiently
than JAK1 and JAK2, in correspondence with the magnitude of experimental
ΔGbind values (JAK3 −10.18
to −12.44 kcal/mol < JAK1 −9.67 to −11.96
kcal/mol ∼ JAK2 −9.68 to −11.92 kcal/mol) converted
from IC50 values (JAK3 of 0.75–34 nM < JAK1 of
1.7–81 nM ∼ JAK2 of 1.8–80 nM).20,24,26,27

2.6 Motion of Proteins
PCA or covariance
analysis is a statistical method used to identify the most relevant
collective motions along MD trajectories.39 Among the three complexes, the tofacitinib/JAK3 system with the
lowest binding free energy was chosen to investigate the motion of
apo and holo proteins. The last 150 ns MD trajectories were used for
PCA analysis. The PCA screen plot of PC modes is plotted in Figure 6A. The covariance
matrix of atomic fluctuation data was diagonalized to build a two-dimensional
(2D) projection on the first two PCs (Figure 6B). The first principle component PC1 is
shown in Figure 6C.

Figure 6 (A) PCA
screen plot of PC modes and (B) the 2D projection of two
PC modes, PC1 and PC2, derived from MD trajectories of the JAK3 apo
form (left) and the tofacitinib/JAK3 complex (right). (C) PC1 Porcupine
plot of the apo form and holo form of JAK3, where the arrow head indicates
the direction of motion, while the length indicates the amplitude
of motion.

The first twenty PC mode values
showed the accumulated variances
of apo and holo forms in Figure 6A. Tofacitinib bound at the ATP-binding site of JAK3
could increase the percentage of variances of PC1 from 12.32 to 21.66%
with a lower distribution in 2D projection on the first two PCs (Figure 6B). In Figure 6C, the G loop region of the
apo JAK3 protein was flipped away to the upper site with a high amplitude.
Interestingly, when the ATP-binding site of JAK was accommodated by
tofacitinib, the motion of the JAK3’s G loop was flipped into
the binding site resulting in a closed conformation, similar to the
motion of Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, driven
by butoxy mansonone G binding.40 Thus,
a high fluctuation of protein motions likely observed in apo JAK can
be dramatically reduced upon tofacitinib binding with a consequence
of structural change from open conformation to closed conformation.

3 Conclusions
In this research, the drug–target
interactions of tofacitinib
with the three JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3) at the molecular level
were extensively studied using 500 ns MD simulations with three different
initial velocities (1.5 μs in total). The obtained results revealed
that tofacitinib interacted with all kinds of JAKs at the active site.
The two important Glu and Leu residues of JAK1 (E957 and L959), JAK2
(E930 and L932), and JAK3 (E903 and L905) in the hinge region strongly
stabilized tofacitinib binding via the formation of two strong hydrogen
bonds. Most of the key binding residues provided the ligand stabilization
through the vdW interaction, whilst such Glu highly contributed to
tofacitinib via electrostatic attraction. Tofacitinib fitted well
within the active site of all protein targets, in particular JAK3,
as clearly seen by the higher number of surrounding atoms. All MM-PB(GB)SA,
QM/MM-GBSA, and SIE binding free energy calculations predicted that
the binding affinity of tofacitinib toward JAK3 was greater than that
toward the other two JAKs, in good agreement with the reported IC50 values. Additionally, tofacitinib binding could feasibly
reduce the fluctuation of the protein motion, in particular at the
glycine loop of proteins, inducing the closed conformation. Our results
provided a better understanding of how tofacitinib inhibits JAKs at
the molecular level, and the trajectories from this study can be further
used for finding more potent inhibitors against JAKs such as pharmacophore-based
virtual screening.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Computational Methods
4.1.1 System Preparation
The 3D structures
of JAK1 and JAK3 were obtained from the protein data bank (PDB codes: 3EYG(19) and 3LXK(20)). All missing residues (residues 946–950
in JAK1 and 1038–1044 in JAK3) were completed using the SWISS-MODEL.41 The obtained homology model was then validated
by the Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK.42 The Supporting Information in Figure S2 showed that both models were mostly found in the favored region
with a value of 92.6% for JAK1 and 92.1% for JAK3. Since there is
no co-crystal structure of the JAK2-tofacitinib complex, the pyrrole-3-carboxamide
in JAK2 (PDB code: 4D0X(21)) was replaced by tofacitinib via superimposition
with the tofacitinib/JAK1(3) complex using the UCSF Chimera package.43 The protonation states of all ionizable amino
acids were characterized using PROPKA 3.0.44

4.1.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Each tofacitinib/JAK complex was prepared by all-atom MD simulations
with three different initial velocities using the pmemd CUDA in AMBER1645 in periodic boundary conditions with the isobaric-isothermal
(NPT) ensemble. Details of simulations were as described for other
biological systems.46−48 The FF14SB49 and GAFF50 force fields were applied for protein and tofacitinib,
respectively. To generate the partial charges of inhibitor, the 3D
structure of tofacitinib was optimized by the HF/6-31(d) level of
theory as per previous studies51−53 using the Gaussian09 program.54 The electrostatic potential (ESP) charges and
restrained ESP (RESP) charges of the ligand were generated using parmchk
of AMBER16. The systems were soaked in the boxes of explicit water
using the TIP3P model (∼10 750 molecules for JAK1, ∼10 696
molecules for JAK2, and ∼10 439 molecules for JAK3).
The time step was set as 2 fs at a constant pressure of 1 atm.55 The short-range cutoff of 12 Å was used
for nonbonded interactions, while long-range electrostatic interactions
were treated by Ewald’s method.56 Temperature and pressure were controlled by the Berendsen algorithm.57 The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain all
covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms.58 The simulated models were heated up to 310 K with the relaxation
time for 100 ps. The temperature was controlled by a Langevin thermostat
with a collision frequency of 2.0 ps. Finally, the unrestrained NPT
simulation was performed for 500 ns. The MD trajectories were recorded
every 500 steps for analysis. The RMSD analysis of each system was
performed using all atoms. The intermolecular HB occupation, SASA,
the number of contacts, and the motion of proteins were evaluated
using the CPPTRAJ module.59 Besides, the
MM-PB(GB)SA and QM/MM-GBSA ΔGbind and ΔGbind,residue were calculated
by the MM/PBSA.py module.60 Note that in
the QM/MM approach, tofacitinib was quantum-mechanically treated by
the semiempirical method PM3 and the self-consistent-charge density-functional
tight-binding method (SCC-DFTB),61 whereas
the remaining region was described by molecular mechanics using the
FF14SB force field. The same sets of MD snapshots were used to predict
the ΔGbind based on the solvated
interaction energy (SIE) method.62 SIE
is an end-point physics-based scoring function for predicting binding
affinities in aqueous solution, which is calculated by an interaction
energy contribution, desolvation free energy contribution, electrostatic
component, and nonpolar component.62

4.2 Experimental Section

The IC50 of tofacitinib
toward the kinase activity of
JAK2 and JAK3 were measured using the ADP-Glo Kinase Assay Kit (Promega).
The reaction contains 2.5 ng/μL of JAK2 (Sigma-Aldrich, SRP0171)
or JAK3 (Sigma-Aldrich, SRP0173) with 5 μM ATP and 2 ng/μLpoly(glu·tyr)
in a buffer (40 mM Tris–HCI pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2,
and 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin). The reactions were incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 5 μL of the ADP-Glo reagent
was added and incubated for 40 min. After that, 10 μL of kinase
detection reagent was added and incubated at room temperature for
30 min. Finally, the luminescence measurement of the ATP product was
performed using a microplate spectrophotometer (Synergy HTX Multi-Mode
reader, BioTek, Winooski, VT). All assays were performed in triplicate.
The inhibition (%) of tofacitinib was calculated in comparison to
control the reaction with no inhibitor. The data were analyzed using
GraphPad Prism 7.0 software.
