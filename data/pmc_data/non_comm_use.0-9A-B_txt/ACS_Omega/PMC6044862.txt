The current article
describes the synthesis, characterization,
and application of a designed hybrid fluorescent BTD–coumarin
(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-coumarin) derivative (named BTD-Lip). The use of BTD-Lip for live-cells staining showed
excellent results, and lipid droplets (LDs) could be selectively stained.
When compared with the commercially available dye (BODIPY) for LD
staining, it was noted that the designed hybrid fluorescence was capable
of staining a considerable larger number of LDs in both live and fixed
cells (ca. 40% more). The new dye was also tested on live Caenorhabditis elegans (complex model) and showed
an impressive selectivity inside the worm, whereas the commercial
dye showed no selectivity in the complex model.

Introduction
Selective and stable
small-molecule fluorophore development is
of paramount importance for furthering diagnostics, chemical biology,
medicine, and many other life sciences applications.1 Stability for long periods with no photobleaching is among
highly desirable features for new fluorescent dyes. The challenge
of developing new fluorescent compounds for cell imaging begins with
the molecule design, meaning the new structure must be capable of
transposing the cellular membrane and selectively stain a specific
cell component or organelle inside the highly complex cellular environment.2 Afterward, stable and bright emissions are also
mandatory for a precise subcellular localization and for dynamics
studies.3 Commercially available dyes typically
show fast photobleaching and have low chemical- and photostabilities.

Lipid droplets (LDs) are pivotal structures for life maintenance.4 BODIPY and Nile Red are the commonest commercially
available fluorophores used for LD staining inside live cells, although
their limitations such as leakage, photobleaching, blinking, low stabilities,
and fade-off are very well-known drawbacks,5 as very recently reviewed.6 On balance,
only some LDs are stained using these two fluorophores, therefore
limiting many studies and escaping both the distribution and the dynamics
of other lipid types7 such as glycerolipids,
grycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and others.8 In other words, a large number of LD structures are not
stained using the commercial dyes. LDs are known to be essential for
energy supply and are associated with many health issues from obesity
to neurodegenerative diseases as a straight consequence of lipid metabolism
deregulation. The fast dynamics associated with LD (and lipid structures)9 is another drawback to monitor their live flux,
and many types of lipid-based structures8 usually escape detection therefore turning LD detection and quantification
an even more challengeable task. Another drawback of such a limitation
is that misleading conclusions may be reached because many lipid structures
escape from the detection when commercial dyes are used. In this sense,
to the best of our knowledge, there is no lipid marker (fluorescent
small molecules) capable of staining a large number of lipid types
to follow their dynamics and to quantify the formed structures.

From cells to complex organisms, the gap and the challenges are
even higher. The complexity increase has, as a consequence, the need
for more selective and stable fluorophores capable of precise responses
to fulfill the gap among these two astonishing worlds. Hence, the
observed results inside live cells cultures will not necessarily return
similar results when model organisms such as Caenorhabditis
elegans are used. Caenorhabditis elegans has been regarded as a platform for integrating chemical and biological
research studies10 because of its attractive
features such as (i) it is a multicellular organism (a nematode worm),
(ii) it is transparent and facilitates fluorescence detection, (iii)
it has organs and differentiated tissues, and (iv) 50–80% of
its genes are homologues to humans.10 The
use of such model organisms for lipid detection studies are fundamental,
especially considering that lipid storages are known to be physiologically
regulated therefore requiring intact animals11 for precise evaluations. Nearly 400 genes have been identified in C. elegans related to lipid storage, and these genes
proved to have human homologues.12 At this
point, one could fairly conclude that only cellular studies of lipids
are not enough for a deep comprehension on the actual roles and consequences
of lipid deregulations.

To come through these limitations, few
fluorogenic small-molecule
dyes have been developed in recent years trying to surpass such boundaries
and aiming at specific lipid staining.7,13−16 Some of these small molecule dyes were indeed tested and compared
against C. elegans,13,17,18 but displaying severe limitations such as
lack of sensitivity or lack of selectivity in the living nematode.
Those new fluorophores likewise require several synthetic steps, showed
some leakage, and stained most lipids observed with commercial dyes,
typically LD. Bearing in mind that live cells and the worm C. elegans also have other lipid types,19 these lipids will likely escape detection when
such dyes are used.

2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BTD) fluorophores
are a new class of stable
emitters capable of transposing the cell membrane and with high chemical-
and photostabilities, as we have recently highlighted.20 By using BTD-based fluorophores, some interesting
applications were described. For instance, tumor cells under hypoxic
condition were labeled,21 ligand trafficking
in artificial and living cell systems could be probed,22 and other applications are found.23−27 Among these new applications, selective LDs staining was described
by us28 and by others.29 We have shown the potential of BTD fluorophores for selective
mitochondrial staining,30 for dynamic and
endocytic internalization studies,28 and
others,31,32 as we have recently highlighted.20 In this perspective, we envisaged the synthesis
of a fluorescent BTD–coumarin hybrid (named BTD-Lip) aiming at a stable lipid probe for live cell imaging and to test
it in the complexity of the nematode C. elegans for lipid detection and quantification. Herein, we disclose our
findings.

Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 shows the
synthesis of the new BTD–coumarin fluorescent hybrid compound.
The designed structure should, in principle, overcome the aforementioned
drawbacks because of the highly desirable chemical- and photophysical
properties of fluorescent BTD derivatives, as reviewed elsewhere,33,34 therefore improving the beneficial photophysical properties of lipophilic
coumarin derivatives.17 The use of hybrid
derivatives is indeed an elegant strategy gaining attention in recent
years.35

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the
Fluorescent BTD–Coumarin Hybrid (Named BTD-Lip)
Note the structure was designed
to have improved photophysical properties because of the donor–acceptor
molecular architecture and to improve the stability of the lipophilic
coumarin moiety.

For the new BTD hybrid structure,
we used a p-methoxyphenyl
group on one side of the BTD core aiming at taking advantage of its
electron donation property. BTD is known to be an efficient electron
acceptor,33 and therefore this push–pull
arrangement may facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)
in the excited state. On the other side, a coumarin group was attached
in accordance with the strategy of hybrid fluorophores, as explained
before. Although several lipophilic groups could be used to tune this
feature, the coumarin core would also extend the π-conjugation
and help in the ICT process. The coumarin scaffold has a lipophilic
character36 and is capable of undergoing
an efficient ICT with the adequate substituent, as recently demonstrated
by Rendina and co-workers.36 In the current
work, the coumarin is attached in the BTD extending the π-conjugation
and substituted at its C7-position (coumarin as reference), that is,
a position known to facilitate a light-up effect and ICT of fluorescent
coumarin derivatives.36 Tian and co-workers37 also used the lipophilic character of a C7-substituted
coumarin to design a structure to intracellular stain of liposomal
structures. In another example, Raić-Malić and co-workers38 linked triazole groups specifically at the C7-position
of the coumarin core to improve its physicochemical properties. With
the benefit of the available knowledge, we could therefore expect
the new designed structure BTD-Lip to display improved
lipophilic character with improved photo- and physicochemical properties.

As depicted from Scheme 1, the hybrid compound BTD-Lip was obtained in
two steps and had its photophysical properties evaluated. Table 1 summarizes the obtained
results and Figure S1 (in the Supporting Information file) shows the UV–vis, fluorescence emission, and Stokes
shift (cm–1) versus ETN values for the
tested solvents (solvatochromic method39,40) plots of
the new fluorescent BTD-Lip. Overall, results show the
high stability of the designed compound, as indicated by its large
values of Stoke shifts (118–181 nm) and molar extinction coefficients
(log ε 3.42–3.96). The large Stoke shifts are likely
a consequence of the efficient ICT, as noted for coumarin derivatives
bearing this feature.41 This effect is
also a consequence of the push–pull architecture42 of the designed structure. The efficient push–pull
observed in the BTD-Lip structure facilitates the ICT,
and therefore large Stokes shift may be noted in such cases.43

An evaluation
of the probe using an aqueous soluble lipophilic
environment, that is, using sodium dodecyl sulfate below and above
the critical micellar concentration (CMC, 8 mmol L–1)44 was also performed (Figure S5). As depicted from Figure S5, the fluorescence intensity increases (light up) after the CMC is
reached, indicating an affinity for lipophilic regions as will be
discussed and showed in the cellular experiments.

To be sure
about the low cytotoxicity of BTD-Lip,
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
experiments were performed and showed that the hybrid BTD fluorescent
derivative is indeed noncytotoxic for the cells (Figure S2). Afterward, BTD-Lip also had its capacity
as a selective cell marker initially tested against Caco-2 cancer
cell lineage (Figure 1).

effectiveness in both live and fixed Caco-2 cancer cells. (A–D)
show the live samples, whereas (E–H) show fixed samples. (A,E)
show the fluorescent aspect of LDs (arrows) using the commercially
available BODIPY (green emission), whereas (B,F) LDs stained with BTD-Lip. (D,H) show the normal morphological aspects of the
cells by phase contrast microscopy. (C,G) show the overlay between
(A,B) and (E,F), respectively, with yellow emission (red plus green),
showing the match of the LDs using the commercial BODIPY and the developed BTD-Lip. The letter “N” indicates the cells’
nuclei. Scale bar of 25 μm.

The designed dye was tested using a considerably less-concentrated
solution (3 μM) when compared with the commercial dye BODIPY
(12 μM) used to stain LD (see the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information file for details).

To confirm the precise subcellular localization of BTD-Lip and to confirm the selective LD staining, an additional assay was
performed using the LD marker BODIPY, a widely commercially available
dye used to stain lipids. The analyses show that the spherical organelles
stained by BTD-Lip are in fact LD (Figure 1). The fluorescent pattern and distribution
obtained using the commercial BODIPY (in both live and fixed cells)
proved to be close to that with BTD-Lip. The fluorescent
overlay images (Figure 1C,G) showed a yellow emission, that is, a perfect match of the combination
of the green and red emissions using BODIPY and BTD-Lip. The distribution of the LD stained with BTD-Lip is
however slightly different from those using BODIPY. BTD-Lip clearly stained considerably more spherical structures than those
observed by using BODIPY. This feature shows that BTD-Lip has the affinity to other lipid structures rather than those stained
by the commercial dye, a known limitation when BODIPY or Nile Red
is used.6 Looking at the dots in yellow
color (Figure 1), one
may see that their number and distribution are very similar to that
of BODIPY staining pattern. Looking at the dots in red color however
one sees that these dots are much more distributed and in higher number
than those observed in yellow color. This difference indicates that BTD-Lip was capable of staining much more lipid bodies than
those stained by BODIPY. The hybrid dye showed therefore strong affinity
with other lipid categories found in mammal cells, which BODIPY is
unable to stain. Lipids found in mammal cells can be grouped in different
categories such as fatty acyls, glycerolipids, grycerophospholipids,
polyketides, sterol lipids, phenol lipids, sphingolipids, and saccharolipids,
and these molecules have profound structural differences. It is likely
that BTD-Lip is capable of associating with a more diverse
lipid structures, and this feature provides the ability to stain other
lipid bodies in the mammal cells, especially considering that the
structure was designed to be lipophilic. The bright emission of BTD-Lip with neither photobleaching nor blinking allowed a
precise quantification of the LD structures found in the cytosol of
the cells (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Lipid structure quantification from fluorescent profile of live
and fixed Caco-2 cancer cells stained with BTD-Lip and
with commercially available BODIPY.

In live cells, BTD-Lip stained ca. 32% more
LD than
BODIPY, whereas in fixed cells BTD-Lip stained ca. 40%
more lipid structures when compared with the commercial dye. These
results rendered BTD-Lip as a superior LD marker, and
it can be used to follow the dynamics of lipid structures in live
cells including other lipid-based structures (fatty acyls, glycerolipids,
sphingolipids, and saccharolipids), a feature not possible using the
widely used BODIPY. The water solubility of BTD-Lip was
2.5 mg mL–1 at room temperature, meaning that at
the given concentration used at the cellular experiments (3 μM),
the dye was completely soluble, as expected. Its lipophilic character
is in this sense the key toward lipid affinity and not its solubility.

BTD-Lip also had its capacity to be used associated
with different dyes evaluated (Figure 3). In the experiment, BTD-Lip was tested
alongside the commercially available DAPI (for nuclei staining and
blue emission) and BODIPY (green emission). A bioorthogonal analysis
was also performed to ensure BTD-Lip was inside the cells
rather than in their surface (Figure 3D). The orthogonal analyses afforded 50 images in the Z-axis. The images were staked and then a three-dimensional
(3D) projection was performed with all of the 50 images. The 3D projection
was transversally cut in two different points, that is, the inner
area of the cut 3D projection from the horizontal and vertical orthogonal
planes (see Experimental Section for more
details).

cells with BODIPY and BTD-LIP, respectively. (C) Overlay

images. The white arrow is indicating a cell nucleus (stained with
DAPI—blue emission) position in the orthogonal projection,
and the yellow arrow is indicating the LD position. The same feature
is visualized in the right side of the image (secondary orthogonal
projection). The white dashed lines indicate the transversal planes
from the cut. Scale bar of 25 μm.

The analyses confirmed that all spherical structures located
in
the cells’ cytoplasm were positively stained by BODIPY (Figure 3A) and BTD-Lip (Figure 3B). This
assay had established that these spherical structures are in fact
LD. This assay also revealed that both fluorescent agents have the
same homogeneous distribution inside of the lipid structures, producing
therefore a fluorescent signal colocalized in the spatial fluorescent
signal overlap (Figure 3C) as an orange (red + green) emission. The orthogonal analyses of
the cells demonstrated that the spherical structures stained using
BODIPY or BTD-Lip are truly located inside the cells’
cytoplasm (Figure 3D).

Because of the high fluorescence intensity and wide distribution
of the LD stained using the hybrid BTD-Lip, an analysis
of distribution could also be realized and compared with the commercial
BODIPY (Figure 4).

staining, and the red asterisks show no background staining. (A2,B2)

of both dyes.

The analyses showed interesting
results. Figure 4A,B
shows several lipid bodies dispersed
in the peripheral region in the cytoplasm. The fluorescence intensity
analyses in the same image provide a remarkable evidence of higher
intensity of the fluorescent signal produced by BTD-Lip against the low fluorescence intensity produced by the commercial
dye (Figure 4, panels
A1 and B1). These results are in agreement with the previous observation
(Figure 2). The intensity
analyses also showed a medium staining in the background produced
by using BODIPY. The stained background is represented by the granularity
in the frame outside the cells area (Figure 4, panel B1) indicated by white asterisks.
No background staining was contrariwise produced by using BTD-Lip (Figure 4, panel
B2), as noted in the red asterisks. In this case, no granularity in
the frame outside the cell area could be noted, indicating the higher
efficiency of the designed hybrid probe. The intensity result was
also plotted in a 2D histogram (Figure 4, panels B1 and B2) to show clear-cut differences between
the fluorescence intensities of both compounds.

To gain insights
on the generality of BTD-Lip as the
selective LD marker, additional cancer cell lineages have been tested
(Figure 5), that are
MCF-7 (breast cancer cells) and MDA-MB-231 (invasive human breast
adenocarcinoma cells).

Reference scale bar of 25 μm.

Encouraged by the superior results that we obtained using BTD-Lip, we tested its ability against the complex live model, C. elegans (Figure 6).

designed probe BTD-Lip (panel (B), red emission). (B)

inside in the worm body as may be observed in the boxes at bottom
and right sides. (C,D) Normal morphological aspects of the samples

The BODIPY staining pattern observed
in the C. elegans shows the lipids
bodies positively stained but displaying an unspecific
staining background distributed all along worm body (Figure 6A). The fluorescent pattern
observed in the nematodes stained with BTD-Lip, however,
was much more intense and highly specific (Figure 6B). No background staining could be observed
in the worm. An accurate lipid body staining showing several spherical
structures dispersed inside of all nematode body with a slight accumulation
in the posterior region of the worm body (Figure 6B) was clear-cut using the hybrid designed
dye. The inner position of the lipid bodies stained with BTD-Lip are clearly identified in the orthogonal projection (Figure 6B2). These regions are known
to be lipid-rich, therefore confirming the high affinity of BTD-Lip for lipid structures even inside live complex models.

Finally, results obtained herein were reproduced once more using
a stock solution stored for 30 months. No degradation was noted in
the structure of BTD-Lip standing at an ambient temperature
at the laboratory facility. The commercial dye, as described by the
manufacturer, may be kept at −20 °C and cannot be frozen
again.

Conclusions
In summary, a new fluorescent hybrid BTD-coumarin
dye (BTD-Lip) was successfully synthesized, characterized,
and tested as a superior
marker for lipid structures, especially LDs. The new compound proved
to be chemically stable and photostable and does not undergo degradation
from excited states.

Using the designed probe, a considerable
larger number of lipid
structures could be stained when compared with the commercial dye
independent of whether live or fixed cells were used. When a complex
model (C. elegans) was tested, superior
results were once more obtained, and the designed probe stained only
the region known to be lipid-rich, whereas the commercial dye showed
no selectivity. The knowledge gained by this work may be the basis
for the development of new hybrid BTD-based structures for selective
cellular staining and for complex live models such as C. elegans. The designed structure indeed prevailed
where commercial dyes fell short.

(1H NMR) and carbon (13C NMR) were obtained

on the case, as indicated in the legends.

Cellular Staining Procedures
Cell
Cultures
MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma cell),
MDA-MB-231 (human breast invasive adenocarcinoma cell), and Caco-2
(human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma) cells were used. All
cell lineages were maintained in an appropriate culture medium as
recommended by the American Type Culture Collection, supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum along with 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100
μg mL–1 streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Fluorescent Assays
Cells were seeded
on 13 mm round
glass coverslips on the bottom of a 24-well plate, allowed to adhere
overnight, and washed three times with a serum-free medium for the
removal of nonadherent cells. After reaching confluence, the cells
were separated into two samples (live samples and fixed samples).
The live samples were incubated for 30 min in 3 μM solution
of BTD-Lip at 37 °C. These samples were washed three
times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1× (pH 7.4) at room
temperature and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min. The samples
were washed again thrice in PBS 1× (pH 7.4) at room temperature,
and the coverslips were mounted over glass slides using ProLong Gold
Antifade (Invitrogen, OR, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. The fixed samples were first washed thrice in PBS
1× (pH 7.4) and then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min. After
a fixative procedure, the samples were washed thrice in PBS 1×
(pH 7.4) at room temperature and incubated for 30 min in 3 μM
solution of BTD-Lip at 37 °C. The samples were washed
thrice in PBS 1× (pH 7.4) at room temperature, and the coverslips
were mounted over glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen,
OR, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The
negative control was performed by the incubation of the samples using
0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was the diluent used. The samples
were analyzed using a Leica Confocal Microscopy TCS SP5 and excited
using 488 nm wavelength laser emission. All assays were performed
in triplicates, and it was performed thrice for each cell sample under
the experimental condition.

Neutral Lipid Staining
with Commercial BODIPY
The staining
procedures with BODIPY were performed with the same cell groups (live
and fixed cells) as described above. Briefly, the cells samples were
incubated with BODIPY using DMSO solution (12 μM) during 30
min at room temperature. After the incubation of samples, the cells
were washed thrice in PBS, and the samples were mounted over glass
slides by using antifade agent Prolong Gold (Invitrogen, OR, USA),
according to the manufacture’s recommendations. The samples
were analyzed using a Leica Confocal Microscopy TCS SP5 and excited
using 488 nm wavelength laser emission. All assays were performed
in triplicate, and it was performed thrice for each cell sample and
experimental condition.

Lipid Structures Quantification
Alipid quantification
by using ImageJ free software was performed. The images obtained from
BODIPY- and BTD-Lip-stained samples were adjusted to
the same color threshold values. Also, the images were treated by
a level of adjustment to maximize the background removal. The particle
analysis tool with the range of circularity setup of 0.25–1.00
was applied. The in situ option shows that overlay outlines were selected
in the software to be a possible visual inspection of the automatic
selection. The adjustment described above was able to include all
lipids structures from the images.

Cell Viability Assay
The viability tests were performed
with MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), MDA-MB-231 (human
breast Invasive ductal carcinoma), and Caco-2 (human colon epithelial
cancer cell line). The cells were incubated with the BTD-Lip at 100 μM for 24 h and analyzed by standard MTT assays, following
the manufacturer’s recommendations (R&D System Inc, MN,
USA). Briefly, 3 × 103 of each cell line were seeded
in a 96 well plate and maintained overnight a 37 °C. These sample
tests were incubated in 100 μM of BTD-Lip solution
for 24 h. The cells incubated with the solvent agent DMSO (down to
0.1%) at the same conditions and maintained only in the culture medium
were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The samples
were incubated with 150 μL of MTT solution (0.5 mg mL–1) in the cell culture medium for 4 h in the dark at 37 °C. MTT
is reduced by metabolically active cells to insoluble purple formazan
dye crystals that were accumulated inside the cells’ cytoplasm.
The MTT solution was removed and 200 μL of DMSO was added in
all samples to solubilize the formazan dye crystals. The plate was
read in spectrophotometer Spectramax M5 (Molecular Devices, CA, USA),
and the optimal wavelength for absorbance was 570 nm. The MTT assay
was performed in triplicate and also made three independent assays.
The cell viability inhibition was determined by evaluation of MTT
result obtained for test samples compared with the control samples
in the same conditions, following the expression {survival % = [(tested
sample – blank)/(control sample – blank)] × 100}.

C. elegans Maintenance and Staining
Procedures
The nematodes were maintained in the nematode
growth medium (NGM agar medium) inoculated with Escherichia
coli (NA22 strain) in petri dishes. The worms were
seeded and kept at 22 °C for 30 days. The M2 medium was added
to the petri dishes, and the M2 medium and worms were collected and
transferred to plastic tubes (1.5 mL) and centrifuged at 2348g for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded, and this process
was repeated twice. The worms were incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min and the samples were submitted to freeze (in N2) and thaw (in water at room temperature). The samples were washed
thrice in M2 medium and incubated for 2 h with BTD-Lip (3 μM) or in BODIPY (12 μM). The samples were washed
thrice in M2 medium and put over glass slide containing poly-l-lysine at 0.1%. The samples were mounted by using Prolong Gold antifade
agent. The images acquisitions were performed by using the Leica TSC-SP5
confocal microscope. The assays involving C. elegans were performed in triplicate, and the experiments were repeated
thrice.

Orthogonal Analysis from Cell Samples and C.
elegans
Samples were used to produce 50 images
in the Z-axis. The images were stacked, and a 3D
projection with all 50 images was performed. The 3D projection was
transversally cut in two different points. The software module of
the orthogonal analysis (LAS-AF, Leica) created two new images, which
show the inner area of the cut 3D projection from the horizontal and
vertical orthogonal cut planes.

Photostability Assay
A 10 μM solution of BTD-Lip was placed in a
96-well plate. The fluorescence measurements
were recorded every 5 min for a total period of 6 h (Ex/Em = 480/610/695)
under a tungsten halogen light source constant irradiation. The values
were represented as means (n = 3) and fitted to a
nonlinear regression one-phase exponential decay using GraphPad Prism
5.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, (San Diego CA, USA).
