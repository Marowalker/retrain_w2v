Tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) 6-O-sulfamate-based
anticancer agents, inspired by the endogenous steroid 2-methoxyestradiol
and its sulfamate derivatives, are further explored for antiproliferative
and microtubule disruptor activity. Based on recently designed C3-methyl
C7-methoxy-substituted THIQ derivatives, compounds with mono- and
dichloro-substitutions on the pendant N-benzyl ring
were synthesized and evaluated. Although improved antiproliferative
activity was observed, for example, 4a versus 4b and 4b versus 8c, it was relatively modest.
Compound 8c, a 2′,5′-dichlorobenzyl derivative
was, however, identified as a promising antiproliferative agent with
in vitro activities exceeding that of the parent steroid (e.g., GI50 90 nM in DU-145 cells) and was highly potent against a range
of tumor cell lines (e.g., GI50 26 nM for OVCAR-3). 8c inhibited the polymerization of tubulin in vitro with an
IC50 only twofold less potent than combretastatin A-4 and
inhibited colchicine binding to tubulin. Tubulin polymerization assays
showed the parent THIQ 4a to be only a very weak inhibitor,
but a striking potency difference was seen between compounds with
C2′ methoxy and chloro substituents, whereas this was much
smaller when these substituents were positioned at C5′. To
confirm the target in atomic detail and because 8c is
a racemic mixture, an achiral parent THIQ 6-O-sulfamate
derivative 10 was successfully cocrystallized with the
αβ-tubulin heterodimer. The derivative 10 binds at the colchicine site on tubulin, the first example of this
compound class investigated in such detail, with its sulfamate group
interacting with residues beyond the reach of colchicine itself, similar
to a recently reported quinazolinone sulfamate derivative, 6a. The structure also suggests that for racemic C3-methyl-substituted
THIQ derivatives, such as 8c, the (S)-enantiomer is likely
to be preferentially accommodated within the colchicine site for steric
reasons. The results further confirm the potential of nonsteroidal
THIQ sulfamate derivatives for oncology and suggest that the mechanism
of microtubule destabilization for the THIQ compound class is to prevent
the curved-to-straight conformational transition of tubulin required
for polymerization.

==== Body
Introduction
In previous studies, we described N-benzyl-substituted
tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) derivatives as novel microtubule disruptors
with potential therapeutic application for the treatment of cancer.1−5 These compounds were designed to mimic the 2-substituted estratriene
class of microtubule disruptors derived from the endogenous steroid
2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) and, in particular, its sulfamate derivatives
(e.g., 2a (STX140), Figure 1).6−10 Incorporation of a phenolic 3-O-sulfamate group
is generally observed to be highly beneficial for both activity and
oral bioavailability, and STX140 is an optimized anticancer agent
with both 3-O- and 17-O-sulfamate
groups.11 Agents possessing such sulfamate
esters have reached multiple clinical trials in oncology and elsewhere,
primarily for hormone-dependent diseases.11,12 The sulfamoyl group can serve in diverse roles.12

Figure 1 Design of dichlorobenzyl-substituted THIQ-based microtubule disruptors 7 and 8.

STX140 was developed primarily for hormone-independent cancer
applications,
and the nonsteroidal THIQ core was used as a mimic of the steroidal
AB-ring system from which steroidomimetics were constructed. Such
compounds have markedly better physicochemical properties than 2ME
and even STX140 but can maintain in vivo potency. Substitution of
the THIQ nucleus at C6 and C7, with those groups requisite for activity
in the steroidal series, was thus desirable. Attachment at N2 of a
group projecting into the area of space occupied by the steroidal
D-ring and bearing an H-bond acceptor known to be required for optimal
activity completed the prototypical steroidomimetic design.1,2,11 Further optimization led to THIQs
methylated at C3 forcing a more favorable conformation of the steroidal
D-ring mimic by steric repulsion (THIQs of type 3 and 4, Figure 1).3 Related THIQ core chimeric microtubule
disruptors possessing the trimethoxy aryl motif common to many tubulin
colchicine site binders were designed and then further optimized.4,5 As a result, the best compounds in both series displayed nanomolar
in vitro activities, making them equipotent or better than the steroidal
derivatives that underpinned their design.3−5 Most recently,
we designed another steroidal AB-ring mimic by using a dihydroquinazolinone
(DHQ) core structure.13 The most potent
DHQs derived from this series were also sulfamates of type 6 (Figure 1) with the
best compounds again displaying nanomolar in vitro activities.

Like the steroids, the most potent heterocyclic derivatives were
found to disrupt the polymerization of tubulin and inhibit the binding
of [3H]colchicine to tubulin. THIQ sulfamates also inhibit
carbonic anhydrases (CA) II,4 an interaction
believed to contribute to the high oral bioavailability observed for
the steroid derivatives,14,15 and CAIX,16 which affords extra targeting of hypoxic tumors.
In addition, the activity of nonsteroidal THIQ derivatives mirrors
that of the steroidal series, with compounds capable of inhibiting
the growth of taxane-resistant cancer cells17−19 and human umbilical
vein endothelial cell proliferation (a commonly used marker for antiangiogenic
activity),20,21 thus supporting the idea that
these small-molecule agents work in a similar manner to 2ME and its
bis-O-sulfamate derivative 2a (STX140).

Very recently, the mechanism of these heterocyclic sulfamate esters
in the destabilization process of microtubule polymerization was investigated
for the first time in atomic detail. The crystal structure of the
most potent DHQ sulfamate of type 6, the N-(2′,5′-dimethoxybenzyl) derivative 6a, in complex with tubulin revealed molecular details to support further
strategies for structure-based optimization. Interestingly, the sulfamate
group was shown to play a role in binding at the colchicine site of
tubulin. The mechanism of microtubule destabilization, at least for
this particular DHQ 6a, was established as preventing
the curved-to-straight tubulin conformational transition required
for microtubule formation.13,22

DHQ derivatives,
although highly effective, are not charged at
the linking N-atom. THIQ derivatives likely have more developmental
potential, their charged nature in particular affording better solubility
via salt formation at the N2 position. Moreover, they have been shown
to be orally active in vivo when dosed in an aqueous buffer, with
some being as potent as STX140.4 It was
thus of interest to explore the potential for further optimization
of such derivatives via new substitutions in the pendant aryl ring
and, moreover, if this THIQ class could also be cocrystallized with
the αβ-tubulin heterodimer, such that atomic level information
could be obtained, for further structure–activity relationship
(SAR) development. In the present work, we explore the replacement
of methoxy groups present in the steroidal D-ring mimic of C3-methylated
THIQs with chloro substituents to determine whether such less polar
and more lipophilic H-bond acceptors improve microtubule disruptor
potency (Figure 1).
Therefore, we introduced 2′,3′-, 2′,4′-,
and 2′,5′-dichlorobenzyl groups at N2 to explore SAR
in a focused series of phenols and their sulfamate esters and explored
their antiproliferative and antitubulin activities.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
The candidate THIQs were synthesized in two
steps starting from (±)-6-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-THIQ 9.3N-Benzylation
using dichlorobenzyl halides, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 140 °C
for 18 h gave phenols 7a–c in moderate yields.
The target sulfamates 8a–c were synthesized using
sulfamoyl chloride as a solution in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA)23 (Scheme 1).

Biology
All six compounds were evaluated
at the US
National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the full 60-cell-line assay that
allows activity across a wide range of cancer types to be assessed
(Tables 1 and 2). The in vitro activities of these compounds against
DU-145 prostate and MDA MB-231 breast cancer cell line proliferation
are shown in Table 1. Data from both cell lines are in strong agreement. Overall, compounds
in this small series of N2-dichlorobenzyl C3-methyl-substituted THIQs
exhibit activities in the micromolar and nanomolar ranges. Phenols 7b–c are only about 3–5-fold less active than
their corresponding sulfamates 8b–c against the
proliferation of DU-145 prostate cancer cells and MDA MB-231 breast
cancer cells. The exception is phenol 7a that proved
to be more than 10-fold less active than its corresponding sulfamate, 8a. GI50 values of the sulfamates 8a–c range between 90 nM (8c; DU-145) and 551 nM (8a; MDA MB-231). The best THIQ 8c of this small
SAR screening set proved slightly more potent or very similar to previously
reported THIQs, 4a–b.3 However, data from the NCI-60-cell-line panel for 4a–b against DU-145 and MDA-MB 231 cells suggested that 8c is significantly more potent than 4a, but only about
as potent as 4b. Overall, the antiproliferative activity
was significantly improved when the 2′-methoxy group was replaced
with a 2′-chloro substituent. However, no further enhancement
was observed when the 5′-methoxy group too was replaced with
a 5′-chloro substituent. As these (±)-C3 methyl-substituted
THIQs adopt a steroid-like conformation with the substituent at C5′
pointing into the same area of space as the steroidal C17 β-hydroxyl
group,1−3 it seems likely that the substituent at C2′
will sterically interact with the two hydrogens at C1. Therefore,
only relatively small one-atom substituents such as chlorine seem
well tolerated at the C2′ position. Note that the hydrogen
and fluoro substituents at C2′ in combination with a C5′
methoxy group were also very well tolerated.3 It seems that the only marginally larger C2′ methoxy group
could already force too much of an angle between the THIQ B-ring and
the pendant N2-benzyl ring, resulting in a less favorable overall
conformation, leading to a decrease in activity (4a;
MDA MB-231: 2.1 μM). However, there seem to be less restrictions
for the second H-bond acceptor at C5′ and more space might
be available around that binding site. Note, of course, that in all
cases here, the activities of racemic mixtures are being compared,
with all usual caveats, but vide infra for further discussion on this
point.

cell lines.

b GI50 values for 4a–b are taken from the literature.3

Additionally,
data from six more tumor cell lines are presented
along with the mean activity across the whole panel (MGM value; Table 2). The trend that
emerged for these THIQ derivatives against the proliferation of DU-145
prostate cancer cells and MDA MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro
was essentially confirmed across the whole NCI 60-cell-line assay.
It also confirms the potential of these N-dichlorobenzyl
compounds against a broad range of cancer phenotypes with 8c, in particular, proving highly active (e.g., 26 nM in OVCAR-3; MGM
= 129 nM). Over the whole 60-cell-line panel, compound 4b was slightly more potent (MGM = 102 nM; Table 2). Additionally, the trend mentioned above
with regard to 4a–b and 8c seems
to hold well. Overall 4b and 8c were about
4–5 times more potent than 4a.

To confirm
the target for these, we established the activity of
the sulfamoylated compounds, 8a–c as microtubule
disruptors, alongside the established potent clinical microtubule
disruptor, combretastatin A-4 (CA-4), initially in tubulin
polymerization assays and alongside the previously reported THIQ sulfamate, 10(5) (Table 3). Gratifyingly, the 2′,5′-dichlorobenzyl
derivative 8c very effectively inhibited the assembly
of tubulin, with an IC50 of 0.98 μM, being only about
2-fold less potent than CA-4. The IC50 in
these tubulin-based assays, as is typical with antitubulin agents
with potent cytotoxic activity, far exceeds the antiproliferative
GI50 dose, at least in part because the GI50 values refer to the concentration in the media, not in the cells.
Inhibition of colchicine binding to tubulin for these compounds was
also determined relative to CA-4 for further proof of
targeting, with 8c being the overall best THIQ derivative
to date showing 67% inhibition at 5 μM (Table 3). It is reasonable to propose that these
novel THIQs can, at least partially, be assumed to disrupt normal
dynamic tubulin polymerization by interacting at the colchicine site.
Also, this provides further evidence that methoxy groups as polar
H-bond acceptors are not an essential requirement in the D-ring mimic.
Overall, the tubulin assays showed a striking difference in potency
between compounds with methoxy and chloro as the C2′ substituents
(4a vs 4b), whereas the difference in potency
is much smaller when these substituents are positioned at C5′
(4b vs 8c). But also, here, the C5′
chloro compound 8c displayed an improved IC50 and inhibition of colchicine binding than the corresponding C5′
methoxy compound, 4b.

As in previously published work
on DHQs,13 we employed X-ray crystallography
to determine the atomic level
binding mode of a THIQ derivative within the αβ-tubulin
heterodimer (Figure 2A). To avoid complications that would arise from using the racemic
sulfamate, 8c, we chose a highly potent nonracemic THIQ,
[2-(3′-bromo-4′,5′-dimethoxybenzyl)-7-methoxy-6-sulfamoyloxy-1,2,3,4-THIQ—STX3451, 10], without the C3-methyl group chiral center that had been
optimized earlier5 and which is not too
dissimilar to 8c in its antitubulin activities (Table 3). STX3451 exerts
antiproliferative and antimitotic effects, inducing apoptosis and
involving autophagic processes in MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast and
A549 epithelial lung carcinoma cells24 and
also induces cell death effectively in NF1 tumor cell lines.25 It is therefore somewhat more attractive as
a potential development candidate than 8c. Compound 10 was soaked into crystals formed by a protein complex composed
of two αβ-tubulin heterodimers, the stathmin-like protein
RB3 and tubulin tyrosine ligase (termed T2R-TTL),26 and we solved the T2R-TTL-10 complex structure using X-ray crystallography to 2.4 Å resolution
(Figures 2 and 3B, 4A; Table 4) (PDB ID 6HX8). STX3451 binds to the tubulin colchicine
site22 at the intradimer interface created
by residues from the strands βS8 and βS9 the helix βH8
of β-tubulin, and the loop αT5 of α-tubulin (Figure 4A). STX3451 is well
accommodated within the binding site, displaying an extended “steroid-like”
conformation. These data now provide the second cocrystal structure
of an antitubulin agent that possesses a sulfamate group and the first
one where the steroidal AB-ring system is mimicked by a THIQ core. Figure 4B shows a comparison
of the new THIQ sulfamate binding mode within the colchicine site
with that of the earlier DHQ sulfamate 6a.13

The C-ring of STX3451 is buried
into a hydrophobic pocket formed
by the β-tubulin residues: βVal238, βCys241, βLeu242,
βLeu255, βMet259, βAla316, βIle318, βAla354,
βThr376, and βIle378 (Figure 4A). Moreover, the 4′-methoxy oxygen
of the C-ring forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the main chain
amide and carbonyls of βCys241, βGly237, and βVal238.
The A-ring of STX3451 is stacked between the side chains of βAsn258
and βLys352, and further stabilization is provided by hydrogen
bonds between the sulfamate moiety and the side chains of βLys352,
βAsn349, and αSer178, the main chain amide of αVal181,
and the main chain carbonyl group of βAsn349. Compared to the
DHQ derivative 6a(13) (PDB ID 5OSK), which possesses
an amine group in the B-ring, no water-mediated interaction to the
carbonyl groups of the side chain and main chain of αAsn101
and αThr179 is observed for STX3451 (Figure 4B). Moreover, the 3′-bromo substituent
of the C-ring in STX3451 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the
main chain carbonyl of βVal238, a space that is otherwise occupied
by the 2′-methoxy group in 6a (Figure 4B).

Recently, THIQ compound
(±)-11 (Figure 3A), which is the same as 10 but with an
additional (±)-C3 methyl group as in the
present 8c compound series, was synthesized and evaluated.5 As it was found to be similar to 10 (STX3451) in antitubulin assays (IC50 2.4 μM, 50%
inhibition of colchicine binding5 vs IC50 1.3 μM and 49%, respectively) (Table 3, but note the very slightly different assay
conditions), we would suggest that the additional (±)-C3 methyl
group of the present series should, in principle, be well accommodated,
as presumably also the 2′,5′-dichloroaryl motif. This
former feature was not an issue in the DHQ 6a instance
(see Figure 4B) because
a planar carbonyl group occupies the C3 position. A closer inspection
of the C3 environment in the tubulin-STX3451 crystal structure reveals
that there may be enough space to accommodate both enantiomers of
compound 11 (Figure 3A). However, we modeled compound 11 in
both the (R)- and (S)-configurations into the STX3451 structure without
energy minimization and inspected the C3 environment of both the enantiomers
(Figure 5). The model
suggests that the (S)-enantiomer likely binds without any structural
rearrangements, whereas the (R)-enantiomer would clash into helix
βH8, thereby requiring structural adaptations to get accommodated
into the pocket or even preventing binding. For these reasons, we
expect that administration of the racemate would preferentially select
for the (S)-enantiomer binding to tubulin. It is tempting to view
the respective antitubulin IC50 values of (±)-11 and 10 in the light of this (2.4 and 1.3 μM)
and speculate that (R)-11 might be a very weak inhibitor
or even totally inactive. The antitubulin activity of racemic 3-methyl-substituted
THIQs, such as 8c, may therefore actually be an underestimate
if the (R)-enantiomer is not accommodated or only binds weakly in
the colchicine site because of the structural adaptations necessary.
Exploration of this possibility must however await the resolution
of the isomers but, given the greater development potential of the
achiral THIQ sulfamate 10, this has not been pursued.
Further development of these THIQs through medicinal chemistry might
include the introduction of a (±)-C4 hydroxyl group as it could
attract a water-mediated interaction to the carbonyl groups of the

We further compared the binding
mode of STX3451 10 with that of colchicine by superimposition
of both β-tubulin
chains of their tubulin-ligand complexes (Figure 6; PDB ID 4O2B; rmsd of 0.428 Å over 393 Cα-atoms of chains B). Tubulin undergoes a “curved-to-straight”
conformational change when polymerized into microtubules,22,27 involving an overall compaction of the colchicine binding site through
mainly the βT7 loop and βS8 strand of the β-tubulin
chain.22 As already observed for the DHQ
derivative 6a,13 both compound
poses show similarity and reveal that the respective A rings and associated
methoxy groups of STX3451 and colchicine are very well superimposed,
whereas the more flexible C ring of STX3451 is more extended. Both
compounds, STX3451 and 6a, share a unique and common
polar interaction with the sulfamoyl group of the main chain of αVal181.
As a result of the different shapes of the molecules (STX3451 vs colchicine),
major conformational changes of both the αT5 and βT7 loops
are observed (Figure 6). In summary, the results have established STX3451 10 as a tubulin-binding ligand at the colchicine site in atomic detail.
They also imply that 10, similar to other colchicine-site
ligands,22,28 achieves microtubule destabilization mechanistically
by preventing the curved-to-straight conformational transition.

Conclusions
THIQ sulfamate-based
microtubule disruptors have been further explored.
Racemic N2-dichlorobenzyl C3-methyl-substituted THIQs showed excellent
in vitro activities in the NCI-60-cell-line assays and antitubulin
properties. Chlorine substitution for methoxy was found to be effective,
and 8c in particular exhibits antiproliferative activity
in the 90 nM range, inhibiting tubulin assembly and interfering effectively
with the colchicine site. To explore tubulin binding at the atomic
level without the complication of chirality, a parent THIQ STX3451 10 was cocrystallized successfully with the αβ-tubulin
heterodimer. STX3451 binds more deeply in the colchicine site than
colchicine itself, and the sulfamate group is involved in binding
through specific interactions with β-tubulin residues beyond
those accessed by colchicine. This is the first example of a THIQ
derivative bearing a sulfamate ester bound to tubulin to be explored
in such detail. With subtle differences, 10 adopts a
broadly similar binding pose to a related DHQ derivative. Structural
implications derived from the ligand are that C3 methyl group substitutions,
as in the dichlorobenzyl derivatives, can be accommodated in the colchicine
site. Modeling of (R)-11 and (S)-11 into
the STX3451-tubulin structure further revealed that the (S)-enantiomer
might be mainly responsible for the tubulin activity of such racemic
C3 methyl-THIQ sulfamates as the C3 methyl group of the (R)-enantiomer
would sterically clash with tubulin residues. Most likely, mechanistically
microtubule destabilization by STX3451 is via prevention of the curved-to-straight
conformational transition of tubulin, as shown for colchicine and
the STX3451-related quinazolinone DHQ derivative. With the usual caveats
with regard to chirality, such compounds of this THIQ class are worthy
development candidates for oncology.

Experimental Section
Tubulin
Assays
Bovine brain tubulin was prepared as
previously described31 and used in the
studies presented. Assembly IC50’s were determined
as fully described elsewhere.32 In brief,
1.0 mg/mL (10 μM) tubulin was preincubated with varying compound
concentrations without GTP for 15 min at 30 °C. Reaction mixtures
were placed on ice, and GTP (final concentration, 0.4 mM) was added.
Mixtures were transferred to cuvettes held at 0 °C in a recording
spectrophotometer. Baselines were established at 0 °C and increase
in turbidity was followed for 20 min following a rapid (<30 s)
jump to 30 °C. Concentrations of compound required to reduce
the turbidity increase by 50% were determined. Inhibition of the binding
of [3H]colchicine to tubulin was described fully previously.33 Reaction mixtures contained 0.1 mg/mL (1.0 μM)
tubulin, 5.0 μM [3H]colchicine, and a potential inhibitor
at 5.0 μM. Compounds were compared to CA-4, a particularly potent
inhibitor of colchicine binding to tubulin.34 Mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, a time point at
which colchicine binding in control reaction mixtures is generally
40–60% complete.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure
Solution
Crystals of T2R-TTL were generated as
previously described.25,35 Crystals were soaked for 3 h
at 20 °C in a reservoir solution
(10% PEG 4K, 16% glycerol, 30 mM MgCl2, 30 mM CaCl2, and 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid/imidazole pH 6.7) containing 5 mM of compound 10 (STX3451) and
subsequently transferred into a reservoir supplemented with 20% glycerol
before cryo-cooling in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at
the Swiss Light Source (beamline X06DA, Paul Scherrer Institut, Villingen
PSI, Switzerland) with images indexed and processed using XDS.36 Structure solution using the difference Fourier
method and refinement were performed using PHENIX37 and model building was carried out iteratively using Coot
software.38 The atomic coordinates and
structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) under accession number 6HX8 (T2R-TTL-STX3451).

(Loughborough, UK) and were used as supplied. Petroleum ether (PE)
used for crystallization was of fractions 40–60 °C. DMA
and DMF were purchased from Aldrich and stored under a positive pressure
of N2 after use. Sulfamoyl chloride was prepared using
an adaptation of Appel and Berger methodology39 and was stored in the refrigerator as a solution in toluene under
a positive pressure of N2, as described by Woo et al.40 An appropriate volume was freshly concentrated
in vacuo immediately before use. Compound 9 was synthesized
according to a literature procedure.3 Reactions
were performed at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Flash
column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (MatrexC60). 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Mercury VX 400 NMR
spectrometer and a Bruker AVIII HD 400 spectrometer at 400 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AVIII HD 400 spectrometer
at 100 MHz. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm)
relative to the solvent residual peaks as internal standards. 1H NMR: 7.26 ppm (CDCl3); 2.05 ppm (acetone-d6). 13C NMR: 29.84 ppm (acetone-d6). High resolution mass spectrometry was performed using
