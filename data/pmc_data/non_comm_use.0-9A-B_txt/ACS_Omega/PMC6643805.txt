Aldehydes
may be present in wines as a result of metabolic processes
during wine fermentation or through oxidation and extraction from
wood during wine aging in oak barrels. Apart from acetaldehyde, the
most abundant aldehyde in wine, other aldehydes such as furfural and
more recently vanillin have shown to contribute to the formation of
more stable pigments. The copigmentation effect of phenolic molecules,
including flavanols and anthocyanins themselves, has been previously
evaluated in wine and model solutions, and even the effect of aldehydes
related to wine aging has been documented at different pHs and molar
ratios. The copigmentation phenomenon is observed by hyperchromic
effects and bathochromic shifts of λmax, and, in
the same time, the presence of larger molecular weight pigments, potentially
less susceptible to degradation, was followed up. This experimental
work intended to evaluate the potential of five different aldehydes,
all of which are safe for human consumption and are used in the food
industry, to the formation of pyranoanthocyanin-like and polymeric
pigments in the model solution.

==== Body
1 Introduction
There are different metabolic pathways in which ethanal, also called
acetaldehyde, can be produced during winemaking. The first pathway
is from the pyruvate coming from glucose as a part of the glycolysis
pathway1 or coming from malic acid as a
part of the maloalcoholic fermentation.2 Another pathway is from ethanol through the reversible acetaldehyde–ethanol
step with activity from the cytosolic and mitochondrial alcohol deshydrogenases.3 Finally, ethanal can also be directly produced
by the chemical peroxidation of ethanol that takes place during wine
oxidation during the process of barrel aging or when microoxygention
is applied.4

Despite the way in which
acetaldehyde is produced, this metabolite
and pyruvate may produce vitisins from their condensation with anthocyanins,
process that varies in function of the fermentative yeast strains
used for winemaking.5 Vitisins A and B
are one type of stable pigments formed in red wines by cycloaddition
with pyruvate and acetaldehyde, respectively, during fermentation
and during wine aging. Acetaldehyde can also participate in the formation
of other stable pigments such as vinyl-pyranoanthocyanins (portisins)
and flavanol-anthocyanins ethyl-linked adducts.6 Important to mention is that acetaldehyde can also produce
adducts from the reaction with sodium bisulfite added to wine, reducing
the ability of acetaldehyde to produce stable pigments.

Besides
the fact that acetaldehyde is a metabolite present in wines
during fermentation and wine oxidation, there may be other aldehydes
in wine coming from amino acids when the amount of molecular oxygen
is excessive;7 the aldehydes formed through
this chemical process studied by these authors are methional from
methionine and phenylacetaldehyde (PHAC) from phenylalanine. The presence
of aldehydes from oxidation-related and oak aging-related processes
has been previously reported;8 regarding
the first process, the aldehydes found in wines are methional, benzaldehyde,
PHAC, hexenal, heptenal, octenal, and nonenal; with regards to the
oak aging process, the aldehydes found are furfural, 5-methylfurfural,
5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and syringaldehyde (SYRN).8 The concentration of the aldehydes in wines depends on
different factors such as the age of the wine and the type of aging.
PHAC for example has been found at concentrations of 11 μg/L
in young red wines and up to 78.7 μg/L in Port wines and 91.2
μg/L in red wines with long aging.9 Vanillin, in another example, has been reported in concentrations
at sub-threshold without having an impact in the aroma profile of
wines but, enough to react with other compounds to produce color changes
and reducing their impact in wine.10

It has been reported that furfural can replace acetaldehyde in
the polymerization process in the condensation of (+)-catechin and
anthocyanins observed in wines aged in oak barrels,11 and it has also been shown that methylfurfural reacts with
malvidin-3-O-glucoside to form furanic aldehyde adducts.12 The aldehydes, mainly acetaldehyde, are believed
to form a carbocation as a result of the protonation of the carbonyl
group under acidic conditions.13 This reaction
is followed by the nucleophilic addition to flavanols or to anthocyanins
units.

The presence of phenolic aldehydes could also change
the color
of anthocyanins by copigmentation phenomena in a similar way that
other possible copigments such as hydroxycinnamic acids14 or flavonoids including flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins
through noncovalent interactions such as the intermolecular interaction
and the self-association.15

Beyond
the fact that some of the before-mentioned aldehydes have
a negative contribution to aroma profile of red wines, an experimental
design was conducted with different aldehydes, all of which are safe
for human consumption and are used in the food industry as flavoring
agents, in order to evaluate their contribution to color modification
of red wine model solutions with special interest in the production
of pyranoanthocyanin-like pigments and polymeric pigments. The aldehydes
selected for the evaluation were cinnamaldehyde (CINN), PHAC, phenylpropionaldehyde,
SYRN, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (HMBZ) in which the structures
are shown in Figure 1. SYRN and HMBZ may also be present in wines because these aldehydes
could be extracted from the oak barrels during wine aging16 together with coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde.
All of these five aldehydes have a phenolic moiety that, associated
with anthocyanins, are expected to affect the absorption properties
of the pigments and thus the color that these molecules may have.

aldehydes used in the experimental design. Names and aroma
profiles are listed above each 2D structure. Aldehydes abbreviations
used along the experiment: CINN—cinnamaldehyde; PHAC—phenylacetaldehyde;
PHPR—3-phenylpropionaldehyde; SYRN—syringaldehyde; HMBZ—4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Color Evolution
The change in color
was monitored with instrumental color measurements; the spectrophotometric
technique recorded the variations in absorbance at different wavelengths
(420 nm—yellow, 520 nm—red, and 620 nm—blue).
During the month that the experiment spanned, the percentage at these
three maximum absorbance wavelengths remained steady for the control
(Figure 2A). On the
other hand, variations in the color have been observed when using
different aldehydes. The use of 3-phenylpropionaldehyde (PHPR) decreased
the percentage of red, whereas on the other hand, blue and yellow
increased over time. CINN and PHAC have the largest amount of yellow
among all aldehydes and the lowest contribution from red; regarding
blue fraction, CINN decreases over time, whereas PHAC increases it.
SYRN and HMBZ had the greater values for red percentage after the
control with a slight decrease toward the end of the evaluation; SYRN
has similar values for yellow percentage than the control, whereas
HMBZ has slightly higher values; regarding the blue content, both
aldehydes have larger percentage of blue with a trend to increase
it with SYRN and to decrease with HMBZ toward the end of the evaluation.
These changes in color measurements with different absorption wavelengths
may be attributed to the interaction of the phenolic aldehyde molecules
and the anthocyanins in the model solutions. The shifts observed are
different among the samples.

percentage of yellow,
red, and blue measured with UV–vis; (B) CI; (C) hue (N); (D) visual representation of the CIE L*a*b* coordinates used to show
the changes in color during the span of the evaluation. Mean values
(n = 3). Different letters denote a significant difference
for each solution with 95% confidence level (LSD test).

The measurement of these three fixed absorption
wavelengths also
allowed us to follow up the changes in color intensity (CI) and hue
(N) shown in Figure 2B,C, respectively. As it can be seen, the control has
a steady CI and N during the experiment, whereas
the addition of phenolic aldehydes produces changes in these two parameters.
The aldehydes PHPR, PHAC, and SYRN increase CI over time; on the other
hand, CINN and HMBZ had a decreasing trend. Nonetheless, CI values
are higher than the control after 4 weeks for the trials with aldehydes
as a result of the increased absorptions in yellow and blue fractions.
The pronounced gain in yellow percentage by addition of CINN and PHAC
(Figure 2A) has resulted
in an increase of N three times higher than the control
with a trend to have larger N values over time; SYRN
and HMBZ had N values similar to the control with a slight increase
over time (Figure 2C). Having larger N values is generally related
to wine ageing processes where red wine pigments may undergo copigmentation
phenomena with phenolic compounds found in wine, yielding molecules
with lower maximum absorbance wavelength (ca. 505 nm), toward brick-red
hue.20 Shifts in the maximum absorbance
wavelength of a pigment, toward higher wavelengths, are known as the
bathochromic effect also named the bluing effect in wines.21

The values from the CIE L*a*b* coordinates allowed us to
build up a color palette chart
(Figure 2D) that shows
the evolution of color over the span of the experiment. The lightness
(L*) is larger for PHAC followed by PHPR after one
week, and it has similar values for PHPR, CINN, and PHAC at the end
of the evaluation; higher lightness values may be related to lower
color stability because lightness decrease in wine samples over time
indicates higher color stabilization;22 these authors correlate the decrease in L* with
an addition of oenological tannins, increasing the amount of pigments
in the wine. The reduction of stability observed in the experimental
trials, and therefore an increase in L* values, might
be explained by the fact that aldehydes in excess promote the precipitation
of pigments in wine model solutions.

The CIE L*a*b* values for the control trial
were considered as initial reference
conditions for determining differences among samples after 4 weeks.
Absolute color difference (ΔEab*), variations in lightness (ΔL*), chroma (ΔCab*), and hue (Δhab*) are shown
in Table 1. Positive
values for ΔA520 are the effect
of having fortified CI as a consequence of the addition of copigments
and an increase in absorbance at 520 nm known as the hyperchromic
effect or fortified CI;23 this hyperchromic
effect may be the result of shifting the anthocyanin molecule equilibrium
toward the flavylium-colored form.24 The
smaller the ΔEab*, the less the color variation observed
between samples; in this way, HMBZ had the least color variation from
the control, whereas PHAC had the greatest. The change in color in
all samples having aldehydes was perceived by the human eye, and this
can be explained analytically because the value for ΔEab* was greater than 3 CIE L*a*b* units, which was experimentally determined with red wines
and a panel of observers with normal color vision.25 In terms of lightness (ΔL*), PHPR
and CINN had positive variation because of an increase in L*, whereas the others had negative values for lower L* values. The greater variation in hue (Δhab*) was observed in CINN and PHAC. Another study observed a bathochromic
effect at low pH values (1–3) for vanillic, syringic, and conyferil
aldehydes and also a hyperchromic effect at higher pH values (from
3 to 5); the molar ratio of pigment/copigment also showed to have
an influence on the hyperchromic effect being the molar ratio 1:100
the one having greater effect.26

From the overall results of the color evolution assessment,
those
obtained with SYRN and HMBZ are interesting because N is steadier with respect to the control and have, at the same hand,
larger CI, positive chroma values and hyperchromic effect under this
concrete pH value and aldehyde concentration. These two aldehydes,
unlike the rest, have multiple functional groups (see Figure 1).

2.2 Anthocyanins
Analysis by High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
The number of anthocyanins,
including the nonacylated, the acetyl-, p-coumaroyl-,
and caffeoyl-derivatives, decreased in all cases when aldehydes were
present in the model media after 4 weeks (Figure 3A1) in the same time that some precipitates
began to appear in the bottom of the vials; SYRN experienced less
pigment reduction, whereas on the contrary, PHPR yielded the lowest
concentration of pigments after the evaluation and it had coloring
matter deposited in the vials. A full scale chromatogram from the
samples shown in Figure 3A1 is given in Figure 3A2 to zoom in on the images and stress out the peaks present in the
trials even though their concentration is low. The DAD signal and
mass spectra (MS) from the HPLC–DAD–ESI/MS analysis
allowed the identification of the peaks observed on Figure 3A2 at full scale. The following
anthocyanins were identified in all six samples: delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, petunidin-3-O-glucoside, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, malvidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside, petunidin-3-O-(6-caffeoyl)-glucoside,
and malvidin-3-O-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside.
Besides these peaks, other peaks with unidentified nature are also
reported in samples PHAC, PHPR, SYRN, and HMBZ (Table 2). In the case of PHAC, the unidentified
peaks had maximum absorbance wavelengths between 502 and 515 nm, lower
than those of monomeric anthocyanins but similar to the range of absorption
seen for the vitisins.27,28 One of these peaks, labeled peak
1 in Table 2 had a
molecular ion [M]+ at (m/z) 593 and fragment ion with at (m/z) 431 (Figure 3B1)
which may potentially correspond to the intramolecular interaction
of a malvidin-3-O-glucoside moiety and the PHAC molecule;
this peak has a λmax of 508 nm (Figure 3B2) and tR of 16.62 min.

and at full scale (A2); the DAD signals correspond to the measurement
after 4 weeks. The mass spectrum relative abundance (B1) and DAD signal

DAD signal at 525 nm (C2) for peak identified as potential anthocyanin
dimer condensed with HMBZ with tR of 13.326
min.

Regarding trials PHPR,
SYRN, and HMBZ, the unidentified peaks found
had higher λmax, toward bluish tonality. The weight
of the ions [M]+ of these unidentified peaks resembles
that of polymeric pigments as well as the shift of wavelengths as
a result of a bathochromic effect.20 A
second peak, peak 2 (Table 2), with [M]+ at (m/z) 1094 and λmax at 542 nm found in the trial HMBZ
is similar to that reported for the formation of an oligomeric unit
from the reaction of malvidin-3-O-glucoside and (+)-catechin
in the presence of vainillic aldehyde;10 such pigment formed had [M]+ at (m/z) 917 and λmax 549 (purple color); the
vainillic aldehyde was found to form an aryl linkage. In the current
case study, the reaction may have taken place between two anthocyanin
units because the [M]+ got for peak 2 was at (m/z) 1094 and would potentially correspond to two
anthocyanins moieties linked by one moiety of HMBZ; a second fragment
ion at (m/z) 331 suggests that one
of these moieties correspond to a molecule of malvidin-3-O-glucoside. The mass spectrum relative abundance and the DAD signal
at 525 nm for this peak are shown in Figure 3C1,C2, respectively. Nonetheless, the molecular
ions give information regarding the nature of the components; the
techniques used do not allow the identification of molecular structures
produced.

3 Conclusions
The
color evolution after the addition of phenolic aldehydes in
model wine solution has happened through different mechanisms, and
it is visible to human eye. The addition of aldehydes contributed
to diminish the concentration of pigments in solution to a different
extent and to precipitate coloring matter; what is not, yet clear
is the nature of the interaction of the aldehydes and the anthocyanins
to produce such effect. On the other hand, some aldehydes have apparently
contributed to the formation of pyranoanthocyanin-type pigments with
lower λmax and larger hue values, whereas others
have contributed to having a bathochromic effect after forming pigments
with larger λmax and potential oligomeric/polymeric
conformation. In this way, besides polymerization, the copigmentation
phenomena may have happened intermolecular wise. The further study
of the effect of phenolic aldehydes on the yeast metabolism and, therefore,
on the color stabilization during wine fermentation would provide
further information on this type of stable pigment occurrence.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Model Wine Solution
The model media
were prepared by using a hydro-alcoholic solution (14% v/v ethanol)
with pH 3.5 adjusted by the addition of tartaric acid using a magnetic
stirrer. Natural grape color powder—enocyanin—(EV-12
Red Shade, E-163) from the company Secna (Valencia, Spain) was added
to the model solution to have a concentration of 100 mg/L anthocyanins.

Five different aldehydes were used in the experimental design,
CINN 98+% A14689 (Alfa Aesar, Germany), PHAC 95% A14263 (Alfa Aesar,
Germany), PHPR P0217 (TCI, Germany), SYRN S29672 (Merck, Germany),
and 4-hydroxy-3-metoxybenzaldehyde 99% (Aldrich, Germany). The model
solution was then divided into six different treatments in the function
of the aldehydes used: (1) control (CTRL), (2) CINN, (3) PHAC, (4)
PHPR, (5) SYRN, and (6) 4-hydroxy-3-metoxybenzaldehyde (HMBZ). Each
model solution is having aldehydes in a molar ratio of 1:10 with respect
to the pigment molar concentration; the molar concentration for enocyanin
considers the molecular weight of the malvidin-3-O-glucoside as a reference. The solutions were kept in a 100 mL brown
glass flask at constant 20 °C in the dark with a headspace of
10 mL. Each week, for 1 month, 2 mL of each sample was taken from
each flask and filtered with 0.45 μm methylcellulose membrane
to perform anthocyanins evolution with HPLC–DAD/MS–ESI
and color determinations with UV–vis spectrophotometry. No
measurements for intake of oxygen were determined during the experimentation.

4.2 Color Determination
The color of
the trials has been determined with the use of a UV–visible
spectrophotometer 8453 from Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA)
with a photodiode array detector and the use of a 1 mm path length
cuvette. The absorption at three different wavelengths (420, 520,
and 620 nm) was used to compare CI and hue (N) in
all trials after sample collection. The results are also expressed
as the percentage of yellow (Y %), red (R %), and blue (B %) fractions
present in each sample, obtained from the different absorption signals.17 The percentage obtained is the relative ratio
of each absorbance to the sum of all them.

The color differences
were monitored with the ΔEab as
the Euclidian distance between two points in the CIE Laboratory coordinates.
These coordinates were also used to evaluate quantitative differences
in L* (lightness), Cab* (chroma) and
qualitative differences of hab (hue).18 All CIE L*a*b* values were also determined with the same spectrophotometer
from Agilent Technologies. The formulae used for the calculations
are          

4.3 HPLC Analysis
HPLC with a diode array
detector and electrospray ionization coupled to MS (DAD–ESI/MS)
has been used to identify and characterize known anthocyanins in control
trial as well as the follow up the evolution of anthocyanin profile
in all other trials; an Agilent Technologies 1100 (Palo Alto, CA,
USA) chromatograph with a column RP Kinetex C18 (100 × 4.6 mm;
2.6 μm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used for this purpose.
Two solvents were used: solvent A (water/formic acid 95:5 v/v) and
solvent B (methanol/formic acid 95:5 v/v) with the following gradient
of solvent B (0.8 mL/min): from 20 to 50% from time 0 to 27 min; 50%
from time 27 to 28 min; and finally from 50 to 20% from time 28 to
29 min until reaching a steady state. The malvidin-3-O-glucoside has been used as an external standard at a wavelength
of 525 nm for the quantification of all pigments,19 whereas the identification was carried out with MS positive
scanning from 100 to 1500 m/z from
time 0 to 23 min. The conditions for the electrospray ionization (ESI)
used are as follow: drying gas (N2) flow rate 10 mL/min;
temperature 350 °C; nebulizer pressure 380 Pa (55 psi); and capillary
voltage 4000 V. Detection limit was set to 0.1 mg/L.6

4.4 Statistical Analysis
Means and standard
deviations were calculated, and differences examined using ANOVA and
the least significant difference (LSD) test. All calculations were
made using PC Statgraphics v.XI software (Graphics Software Systems,
Rockville, MD, USA). Significance was set at P <
0.05.
