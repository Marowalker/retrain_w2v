The molecule 1-methyl-5-nitroindoline
(MNI) demonstrates to be
a suitable probe to detect the change of structure of liquid water
by varying temperature. The relationship of the peak wavenumber of
the first absorption band of this probe with temperature clearly shows
a minimum at 43 °C that indicates a change of structure in the
liquid water at ambient pressure. The plot of the MNI wavenumber peak
absorption against the heat capacity of liquid water shows a temperature
range (35–45 °C) that resembles the crossover temperature
proposed by Mallamace et al. (Faraday Discuss. 2013,167, 95) from thermodynamic measurements
(42 ± 5 °C). The crossover temperature range includes the
so-called phase-transition temperature at 34.6 °C and 0.05 atm
measured by Dougherty et al. (J. Phys. Chem. A2006,110, 7577–7580) and matches
the temperature measured from solvatochromism by Catalán and
Gonzalo (43 °C) (Chem. Phys. Lett., 2017,679, 86–89) as the origin of a structural
change in liquid water.

==== Body
Introduction
The molecule 1-methyl-5-nitroindoline
(MNI) (Scheme 1) is
a molecular probe that does not change
its structure when varying the temperature of liquid water, in which
it is dissolved. Its solvatochromic dependence against solvent dipolarity
(SdP) and solvent polarizability (SP) allows us to propose it as a
suitable molecular probe to determine whether structural changes occur
in the liquid water when changing temperature.

Scheme 1 1-Methyl-5-nitroindoline
The structural changes suffered
by liquid water at ambient pressure
are reported for the first time in 1892 by Röntgen,1 when he tried to explain some of the anomalies
reported for liquid water: “it may be found in the assumption
that the liquid water consists of aggregate of two species of differently
constituted molecules”. Röntgen proposed that thermoelectricity
of molten metals could lead to the conclusion that “molecular
transformations can be generated in simple liquids by temperature
changes”. In 2006, with measurements of depolarization Raman,
Dougherty and Howard2 proposed the existence
of a (weak-continuous) transition of phase for liquid water at 34.6
°C and 0.057 atm. This structural change was attributed by the
authors to a change from a tetrahedral coordinate water structure
(ca. HOH angle of 109.47 °C) to another of locally planar water
structures (HOH angle of 120 °C—hexagonal planar), which
would dominate above 34.6 °C. Dougherty2 and Howard also drew the conclusion that “water is a structured
liquid with distinct local structures that vary with temperature”.
The structure of water could be interpreted in terms of different
clusters that vary with temperature, which is one concept of the many
models traditionally defended from theoretical calculations.3 The size of the clusters and the fractions of
hydrogen bonds unbroken decrease with temperature. Wernet et al.4 concluded from X-ray absorption spectroscopy
and X-ray Raman scattering that most of the liquid water molecules
at ambient pressure exhibit two hydrogen-bonded configurations and
on heating liquid water from 25 to 90 °C about 10% of the molecules
change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen-bonded configurations.
These models3,4 involve the rupture of the intermolecular
hydrogen bonds of water. However, Fernández-Serra and Artacho5 challenged the latter evidence by Wernet et al.
(both experiments and theory) because of first principles calculations
(ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at ambient conditions).
These authors defend that there is no need to invoke the breaking
of hydrogen bonds with temperature; the experiments are interpreted
in terms of elongated hydrogen bonds with temperature but unbroken
within the whole temperature range.

Mallamace6 et al. reported that the
isothermal compressibility [KT(T,P)] and the coefficient of thermal expansion
[αp(T,P)] exhibit
a crossover temperature at 315 ± 5 K (42 ± 5 °C). The
parameter KT(T,P) shows a minimum at 315 K; and at the same temperature
and at [αp(315)] = 0.44 × 10–3 K–1, these authors found a “singular and
universal expansivity point”. In agreement with Mallamace et
al., Catalán and Gonzalo7 reported
the solvatochromic behavior of some pure molecular probes in liquid
water from 15 to 90 °C at ambient pressure. The results confirmed
a crossover temperature at 43 °C from the SdP, solvent basicity
(SB), and SP of liquid water. The pure solvent scales used by Catalán
and Gonzalo7 prove the existence of an
internal structural change in liquid water at 43 °C for the reason
that they show a bilinear behavior, an evidence of a change in the
dipole moment, polarizability and basicity of water at about 43 °C.
This is a non-uniform change, however, weak and continuous, in the
structure of liquid water. The crossover is described adequately by
the molecular probes DMNAF and ttbP9 for the liquid water dipolarity,8,9 by anthracene and ttbP9 for the liquid water polarizability,10 and by MNI and 5-nitroindoline (NI) for the
liquid water basicity.11

A recent
review by Nilsson and Petterson12 emphasizes
the cause–effect relationship between the so-called
anomalies of liquid water and their structural origin, all the evidence
reported points out to two classes of local structural environments
that are temperature-dependent.

In this current paper, another
molecular probe, the molecule MNI,
is employed from −15 to 95 °C to provide evidence of the
structural change of liquid water at 43 °C and of electrolyte
aqueous solutions. The solvatochromism of the MNI molecule depends
on the dipolarity and polarizability of the medium, and for water
as a solvent, these two intermolecular interactions are crucial to
understand the change of the liquid water structure with temperature.

Results
and Discussion
Recently, we have shown that liquid water
exhibits7 a unique change of structure
at about 43 °C, which
is recorded because of a clear change of its SP10 and SdP9 by varying the temperature
and also to a minor extent with the change of its SB.11 Only the SP, SdP, and SB scales clearly exhibit a bilinear
behavior with temperature. It is important to emphasize that liquid
water exhibits a large solvent acidity (SA)7,13 that
decreases linearly with the increase of temperature, and it does not
show any sign of structural change at about 43 °C.

It is
known that the solvatochromic parameters for a given solvent
(SP, SdP, SA, and SB) are assessed using suitable spectroscopic probes.9 Also, in order to measure a given solvatochromic
parameter for a solvent it is necessary to use a molecular probe sensitive
to the corresponding solvatochromic property and its corresponding
homomorph, which allow us to discount other spurious solvatochromic
contributions, which are not assigned to the solvatochromic property
under study. The question raised in this work deals with determining
the structural change of water by using only one molecular solvatochromic
probe, which can evaluate whether liquid water undergoes or not a
change in its structure as it was recently reported.7 Actually, MNI is the homomorph molecule used in our solvent
scales for subtracting the solvatochromic contributions because of
the dipolarity and polarizability interactions of the molecule NI.
The NI molecule has demonstrated to be an excellent probe for SB.11

In view of the behavior shown by the liquid
water,7 it seems clear that this molecular
probe should be very
sensitive to the SP and the SdP of the liquid water in a way that
would allow us to quantify how these magnitudes were varying with
the temperature of water. To this end, it is important to note that
we have recently shown14 that there are
chromophores whose first electronic transition should be cataloged
as a transition π (localized) → π* (delocalized).
This electron transition arises from the excitation of an electron
belonging to a π electron pair on a nitrogen atom with amine
hybridization in the molecular structure and therefore strongly localized,
to a π* orbital delocalized along the molecular skeleton. Consequently,
this π (localized) → π* (delocalized) electronic
transition involves a strong electronic delocalization on photoexcitation,
and it will be shifted bathochromically with the increase in the polarizability
of the medium.15 This above-mentioned transition
could also localize part of the charge at other resonant centers of
a given structure and could cause variations in the dipolarity of
the compound by transferring π charge from the amine nitrogen
atom to the rest of the molecular skeleton.

The MNI can be regarded
as good molecular candidate, Scheme 1, because of the rigidity of
its molecular structure and the existence of a significant charge
delocalization from the π-electron lone-pair of the nitrogen
at the amino group to the nitro group substituted at a resonant position.
This charge delocalization involves a significant sensitivity for
MNI to the environment polarizability and dipolarity (Figure 1 and eq 1).

Figure 1 Absorption spectra of MNI in liquid water at
20, 40, and 60 °C.
The peak wavenumber for this absorption band is employed to account
for its solvatochromism.

The solvatochromic behavior of MNI (Figure 1) has been shown to conform to eq 1(14) 1  With n = 132, r = 0.984, and sd = 234 cm–1.

From this eq 1, the
MNI solvatochromism does not depend on the SA nor on the SB; the first
absorption band for MNI shifts bathochromically as both parameters
SP and SdP increase their value. By analyzing the behavior expected
for MNI in liquid water when changing the temperature the conclusions
are as follows: (a) given that when temperature decreases below 43
°C the liquid water has a lower value of polarizability, see
Figure 1 of ref (7), and barely changes its dipolarity, see Figure 2 of ref (7), it is clear that in this
section (−15 to 43 °C) as the temperature decreases, the
MNI probe will shift its first absorption band hypsocromically, and
(b) provided that above 43 °C water increases its polarizability,
see Figure 1 of the ref (7), and very significantly decreases its dipolarity, see Figure 2 of
ref (7), MNI should
exhibit a much larger hypsochromism on increasing the temperature
of liquid water from 43 up to 95 °C. Consequently, both temperature
ranges above and below 43 °C the MNI will increase its wavenumber
so that it will show the location of the temperature at which the
structural change of liquid water occurs. Taking into account also
the results provided by eq 1, the increase in the wavenumber of the first MNI absorption
band should be higher below 43 °C, because of the change in polarization
(dipolarity plus polarizability), than the increase in the wavenumber
of MNI above 43 °C.

The results shown in Figure 2, which collect the peak wavenumber
data for the first absorption
band of MNI measured between −15 and 95 °C, clearly show
that within this temperature range water only changes its structure
around 43 °C. These results clearly validate the above-mentioned
information and contribute to confirm the excellent solvatochromic
behavior of the MNI probe.

Figure 2 Relationship of the first absorption band of
the MNI probe in liquid
water vs temperature. The MNI solvatochromism shows a minimum at 43
°C. The red line denotes the fit of the data experimental values
against temperature to a polynomial of order 3, ν̅abs (cm–1) = 22 308.7 – 6.2T + 0.089T2 – 0.00029T3.

The heat capacity (Figure 3) (cf. ref (16)) is also proposed in biochemistry17 to
exemplify changes in the structure of proteins with temperature, cf.
temperature-induced conformational phase transitions in proteins. Figure 4 shows the dependence
of the MNI probe in water at different temperatures with the corresponding
heat capacity of the water at the same temperatures. Both the MNI
solvatochromism and the heat capacity must exhibit a parallel behavior
as it is seen in Figure 4. Two main trends are observed: on the one hand, two linear dependencies
almost parallel between 0 and 35 °C and between 45 and 94.4 °C,
that is, as the heat capacity increases, the maximum absorption of
the MNI moves to the blue, at higher wavenumbers; a second tendency
adds a different behavior between 35 and 45 °C, in which as the
heat capacity increases the maximum of the probe moves to the red,
this locus of temperature 35–45 °C can be interpreted
as a crossover or transition stage between two water structures, a
smooth and continuous transition, a non-uniform change in the structure
of the water. It must be borne in mind that the solvatochromism of
MNI depends mainly on the polarizability (−4837 SP) compared
with dipolarity (−2818 SdP), besides the polarizability of
the water in that section increases, with a point of change at 43
°C, and the dipolarity of the water decreases with a point of
inflection also at 43 °C. The slight increase in polarizability
between 35 and 45 °C compensates the decrease in SdP, and as
a result, the MNI peak–wavenumber shows an almost flat range
in Figure 2. This locus
of 35–45 °C interconnects the data values by Catalán
and Gonzalo,7 who propose a point of structural
change at 43 °C, with the thermodynamic data by Mallamace et
al.,6 who propose a crossover temperature
range for liquid water at ambient pressure at 42 ± 5 °C,
and with the pioneering data of Dougherty and Howard2 who proposes a structural transition-phase temperature
in water at 34.6 °C (and a vapor pressure of 0.05 atm).

Figure 3 Heat capacity
of liquid water with temperature at ambient pressure.

Figure 4 Wavenumber of the peak absorption of the MNI molecule
in liquid
water vs the heat capacity at constant pressure of liquid water, at
the same temperatures. The temperature range 35–45 demonstrates
to be a crossover in which the peak absorption wavenumber decreases
as the heat capacity increases, to the converse of what happens from
0 to 35 °C and from 45 to 94.4 °C.

It would be interesting to find out whether the MNI probe
modifies
its solvatochromic behavior in aqueous solutions of electrolytes,
either acids or bases, and therefore to infer information that can
be compared with other heat-capacity data of the bibliography.

Structure of
water and electrolyte aqueous solutions
As mentioned above,
a change of the structure of liquid water was
first reported by Röntgen in 1892.1 In 2006, Dougherty2 and Howard tentatively
reported the feasible change, from a tetrahedral (hexagonal) structure
to a planar (hexagonal) structure at ca. 35 °C. When electrolytes
dissolved in water, they will affect its molecular structure, and
therefore, the change of structure with temperature will change as
well as the solvatochromism of MNI. The probe MNI has been dissolved
in liquid water at different concentrations of KOH and HCl (Figure 5), in order to check
the feasible variations in its solvatochromism and in the structure
of water and therefore to be compared with the results already reported
for the corresponding values of heat capacity (Figure 6, cf. ref (16)). As discussed above, the heat capacity measurements
with temperature correlate well with the solvatochromism of the MNI
probe for pure liquid water. Alexandrov18 reported that as the molality of KOH increases to ca. 0.5 M, non-linear
behavior in pure liquid water becomes a linear relationship for the
heat capacity against temperature. This represents a progressive change
in the response of the heat capacity with the molality of KOH and
a corresponding change in the structure of liquid water. The changes
are already seen even at low concentrations of 0.1 m. As reported by Alexandrov,18 “the
aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide have analogues type of dependence
for heat capacity at low concentrations”, the temperature at
the minimum of the curve decreases when concentration increases. The
temperature at the minimum of the heat capacity dependence reaches
a temperature equal to 0 °C at a solution molality of 0.455 mol/kg.

Figure 5 Solvatochromism
of MNI (peak maxima from the first absorption band)
with temperature in pure water (black) and in water solutions with
KOH or HCL, as indicated within the figure.

Figure 6 Heat capacity values extracted from ref (16) for pure liquid water, KOH 2 and 4% water solutions
(2% is 0.50 M and 4% is ca. 1.0 M), and HCl 2 and 4% water solutions
(2% is 0.55 M and 4% is ca. 1.1 M).

Figure 6 shows
data
values for the heat capacity of both KOH water solutions and HCl water
solutions.16 At 2% (ca. 0.5 M) of KOH the
linear behavior is achieved; at 4% of KOH the linear behavior is kept
up, and the heat capacity values are smaller with increasing the concentration
of KOH. The same occurs for the HCl water solutions, Figure 6, but at 2% HCl concentration
the linear relationship is not so clear, there is still a minimum,
though it can be due to an experimental error.

From the solvatochromism
of the MNI molecule in Figure 5, similar conclusions with Figure 6 can be drawn. In
KOH 0.6 M the minimum disappears, a linear relationship is shown,
and it tentatively represents only one liquid water structure for
all the temperature range investigated. Even a tiny concentration
of KOH (10–4 M) perturbs the solvatochromic curve
with temperature, the maximum wavenumber is shifted to the red, a
minimum is still present, at about 46.8 °C (obtained by the fit
of the experimental data to a polynomial of order 3, 22 278.5
– 6.19028T + 0.09177T2 – 3.65378 × 10–4T3). The curve becomes flatter at 0.422 M, with a minimum
at 46.2 °C—an apparent minimum is shown at ca. 40 °C,
probably due to an experimental error in the measurements. At 0.6
M of KOH, no minimum can be found in the solvatochromism of MNI with
temperature, in good correlation with the heat capacity measurements;
this is a sign of a unique liquid structure at 0.6 M KOH water solutions.
For the HCl water solutions, some differences are pointed out: first,
a tiny amount of HCl does not perturb significantly the structure
of water, ca. from 10–4 to 0.01 M, the curves as
close to that in pure water. This could be feasible because the acidic-species
contribution (H+) is embedded adequately into the liquid
molecular structure; some slight modifications are happening, however,
as the minimum is red-shifted from 44.6 in liquid water to 44.9 and
46.2 °C for the HCl solutions 10–4 and 10–2 M, respectively. Finally, the water solution for
HCl 0.6 M shows a minimum at 41.1 °C (Figure 5). The heat capacity for the 2% concentration
of HCl also shows a kind of minimum at ca. 50 °C (Figure 6). A concentration 1 M of HCl
(ca. 4% HCl) might have depicted a linear relationship for the MNI
solvatochromism, without any minimum, in agreement with the heat capacity
in Figure 6. To the
reverse, MNI is not able to probe at 1 M concentration of HCl, the
absorption spectra show an isosbestic point at 382 nm when changing
the temperature, and those changes are not reversible with temperature.
A feasible explanation lies in the fact that most probably, the −N–CH3 site gets protonated, and tentatively the methyl group could
be eliminated. For instance, N,N-dimethylacetamide exhibits a pK(NH3+) of −0.28;19 actually,
it is reported19 that for the −NH3+ → −NH2 equilibrium,
pK(NH3+) for acetamide and
urea in water solutions increases with temperature, and as a matter
of fact, it gets closer to 0.0. Therefore, for 1 M HCl in water solution,
about 50% of the MNI molecules get protonated at the nitrogen site.

Conclusions
The MNI probe describes adequately the origin
of the structural
change of liquid water at 43 °C, and by plotting its solvatochromism
against the corresponding heat capacity values for liquid water against
temperature, a crossover temperature ranging from 35 to 45 °C
is found.

In addition, the MNI solvatochromism accounts for
the changes in
liquid water described by heat capacity values. At KOH 0.6 M water
solution, the MNI solvatochromic relationship with temperature shows
no minimum in good agreement with the corresponding heat capacity
values. Furthermore, even a small quantity of KOH affects the liquid
water structure. To the reverse, an amount of HCl acid from 0.0001
to 0.01 M added to water hardly changes the structure of liquid water,
the amount of H+ cation and Cl– anion
gets embedded in the liquid water without any severe change in the
solvatochromism of MNI, and from that, the structure of water does
not change significantly.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ultrapure
water of Milli-Q quality is used.
The molecule MNI is synthesized as described elsewhere10 and purified using silica-gel chromatography
(eluent: hexane/dichloromethane/ethylacetate, 55:30:15). KOH water
solutions were prepared from potassium hydroxide from Aldrich. HCl
water solutions were prepared from hydrochloric acid fuming 37% from
Fluka.

Characterization
All the UV–vis absorption spectra
for MNI in pure water solutions were recorded on a Cary 5 spectrophotometer
from −15 to 94.4 °C. The concentration used was 1.19 ×
10–6 M, and the extinction coefficient in liquid
water at 451 nm and at 20 °C is log ε = 4.23. No aggregation
effects are monitored. Figure 2 of this paper shows a good resolution of the peak absorbance
against temperature from −15 to 94.4 °C. All the measurements
were recorded with the Cary 5 spectrometer (using quartz cells with
an optical path-length of 10 cm) that exhibits for this range of data
values (22 422 cm–1—ca. 446 nm to
22 183 cm–1—451 nm) a standard deviation
of 0.008 nm for a series of 10 measures at each wavelength peak. Those
absorption spectra for MNI in electrolyte water solutions were recorded
using a Shimadzu 2100 spectrophotometer from 5 to 88 °C (by using
quartz cells with an optical path-length of 1 cm). A thermostat Fisons-Haake
D8 GH was used for controlling temperature within ±0.1 °C.
