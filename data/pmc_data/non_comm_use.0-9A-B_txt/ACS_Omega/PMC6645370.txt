Yolk–shell-type polystyrene@microporous
organic network
(Y-PS@MON) materials were prepared by the Sonogashira coupling of
tetra(4-ethynylphenyl)methane and 1,4-diiodobenzene on the surface
of PS@SiO2 and by the etching of SiO2. The diameter
of PS yolk spheres and the thickness of MON shells were 150 and ∼10
nm, respectively. The thickness of the void space between the PS yolk
and the MON shell was ∼30 nm. Y-PS@MONs were used as templates
for the synthesis of MoS2/C composite materials. Because
of the microporosity of the MON shells and the void space between
the yolk and the shell, MoS2 precursor compounds were efficiently
incorporated into Y-PS@MONs. The heat treatment under argon resulted
in the formation of hollow MoS2/C composites. The contents
of MoS2 in the composites were systematically controlled
by changing the amounts of precursor. MoS2/C with 58 wt
% of MoS2 showed the best energy storage performance with
a capacitance of 418 F/g at a 0.5 A/g current density as an electrode
material of a coin cell supercapacitor, which is attributable to its
hollow structure, high surface area, and the good distribution of
the sliced MoS2 in the carbon matrix. Also, the MoS2/C-58 composite showed excellent retention of capacitances
during 5000 cycles.

Introduction
Template synthesis
is one of the efficient methods to prepare tailored
functional materials.1,2 The performance of the functional
materials is critically dependent on their morphologies and structures.
For example, hollow materials have been extensively engineered1,2 and applied as electrical energy storage materials.2 The thin thickness of shells can maximize the utilization
of active materials and can induce fast energy storage kinetics because
of the facile diffusion of electrolyte solutions. The morphology and
structure of functional materials can be controlled through the engineering
of template materials.

Inorganic materials such as silica have
been extensively engineered
and used as templates.3−5 Compared to inorganic materials, the engineering
of organic templates has been relatively less explored;6−9 especially, porous organic templates are rare,6,7 whereas
nonporous polymer beads have been used as templates.8,9 The porosity of organic templates is beneficial to the incorporation
of precursors into the templates. Moreover, the organic templates
can be converted to carbon materials through heating under inert gases.10,11 Thus, porous organic templates can be versatile for the synthesis
of inorganic material/carbon composites which have been applied as
energy storage materials in supercapacitors or batteries.

Microporous
organic networks (MONs) have been synthesized by various
synthetic approaches.12−17 On the basis of their microporosities and high surface areas, MONs
have been applied for various purposes, including as adsorbents18 and catalysts.19 The
beneficial properties of MONs make them promising materials as templates.6,7 However, the engineering of efficient templates based on MON chemistry
was less explored.6,7 For example, the void space in
yolk–shell-type materials can be utilized for the incorporation
of precursors to tailor functional materials.20 Although yolk–shell-type inorganic materials have been engineered,20 as far as we are aware, organic ones with microporous
shells have not been reported. During our exploration on template
synthesis using polystyrene (PS) beads, we found that PS gradually
disappeared through heat treatment even under argon. Similar results
were reported in the literature.21,22 By contrast,
conventional MONs were converted to carbon materials under the same
conditions. Thus, we have designed a synthesis scheme for yolk–shell-type
PS@MON (Y-PS@MON) materials to engineer hollow inorganic material/carbon
composites such as hollow MoS2/C materials.

MoS2 materials with a unique layered structural motif
have been applied as energy-related materials including electrocatalysts
and electrode materials.23 Recently, the
pseudocapacitive property of MoS2,24−32 which is comparable to that of expensive RuO2,33 has attracted significant attention from scientists.
Mo species on the surface of MoS2 plate join in energy
storage events through changing oxidation states in a range of +2
to +6. Although MoS2 alone showed poor performance in supercapacitors
because of its intrinsic low conductivity and facile stacking behavior,
its carbon composites showed synergistic enhancement of electrochemical
performance for supercapacitors, compared to carbon- or MoS2-only materials.34−42 It can be reasoned that MoS2 with a high theoretical
capacitance (>1000 F/g)37,38 enhances the capacitance
and carbon enhances the conductivity and cycling stability of composites.
To achieve the high performance of MoS2/C composites, the
sliced MoS2 with a few layers should be well-distributed
in the carbon matrix. Moreover, a hollow structure is beneficial to
the utilization of active sites. Although there have been efforts
to engineer efficient MoS2/C composites,34−42 more exploration is required to improve capacitances and stabilities.
To achieve this, the development of efficient organic templates is
required.

In this work, we report the preparation of Y-PS@MONs,
their application
as templates for the engineering of MoS2/C composites,
and electrochemical performances as energy storage materials in coin
cell supercapacitors.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a,b shows
the synthesis scheme for Y-PS@MON and hollow MoS2/C composites
and the thermal decomposition properties of PS yolk and Y-PS@MON.

Figure 1 (a) Synthesis
scheme for Y-PS@MON, control hollow carbon material,
and MoS2/C composites and (b) thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) curves of PS and Y-PS@MON.

Nanosized PS spheres with an average diameter of 150 nm were
prepared
by radical polymerization in the presence of a polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) surfactant (Figure 2a). The PS spheres were coated with silica layers through
the hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in the presence of
an ammonia catalyst. The silica layers showed an undulated surface
and a thickness of ∼30 nm (Figure 2b). For the successful coating of silica
on the surface of PS, the use of 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)·2HCl
(AIBA) as an initiator was critical because the surface of PS spheres
generated by AIBA has positive charges, matching well with the negative
characteristics of silica precursors.43 The MON networks were formed on the surface of PS@SiO2 through the Sonogashira coupling of tetra(4-ethynylphenyl)methane44 with 1,4-diiodobenzene. The thickness of the
MON layers on PS@SiO2 was ∼10 nm (Figure 2c).

(b) PS@SiO2, (c) PS@SiO2@MON, (d) Y−PS@MON,
(e) PS@(NH4)2MoS4@MON, and (f) MoS2/C-68.

The silica layer in PS@SiO2@MON was etched by the treatment
of HF solution to form yolk–shell-type Y-PS@MON materials (Figure 2d). The materials
were investigated by TEM. As shown in Figure 2d, the void space between the PS yolk and
the MON shell was clearly observed. The thickness of the void space
layers was ∼30 nm, replicating the domains of silica layers
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

Considering the microporosity of the MON shells and the
void space
in Y-PS@MONs, we incorporated a MoS2 precursor compound
(NH4)2MoS446 into Y-PS@MONs. As shown in Figure 2e, the precursors were added to the void space and
micropores of the MON shells. The heat treatment of PS@(NH4)2MoS4@MON under argon resulted in the formation
of hollow MoS2/C composites (Figure 2f). The diameter and the shell thickness
of the hollow MoS2/C were 235 and 30 nm, respectively.

The physical and chemical properties of the materials were further
characterized by the analysis of N2 isotherm curves, powder
X-ray diffraction studies (PXRD), and solid-state 13C nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Figure 3).

Figure 3 (a) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm curves
and (b) pore size distribution diagrams [based on the density functional
theory (DFT) method] of Y-PS@MON, PS@(NH4)2MoS4@MON, and MoS2/C-68. (c) Solid-state 13C spectra of PS and Y-PS@MON.

The surface areas of PS and PS@SiO2 were measured
as
33 and 37 m2/g, respectively. Through MON coating, the
surface area of PS@SiO2@MON increased to 250 m2/g. After SiO2 etching from PS@SiO2@MON, the
surface area of Y-PS@MON further increased to 300 m2/g
(Figure 3a). The micropores
and mesopores of Y-PS@MON were clearly observed in the pore size analysis
based on the DFT method (Figure 3b). The micropores and mesopores disappeared in PS@(NH4)2MoS4@MON, and the surface area dropped
to 7 m2/g, indicating the successful incorporation of (NH4)2MoS4 into Y-PS@MONs. The surface area
of MoS2/C-68 (with 68 wt % MoS2) was measured
as 23 m2/g. The PXRD study showed the amorphous character
of Y-PS@MON, matching with the conventional properties of MON materials
prepared by the Sonogashira coupling of organic building blocks in
the literature46−48 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy
on Y-PS@MON showed
the existence of PS yolk and MON shells (Figure 3c). In the control 13C NMR spectrum
of PS particles, the 13C peaks at 40 and 45 ppm were assigned
to alkyl moieties. The aromatic 13C peaks appeared at 126
and 145 ppm. The additional small 13C peak at 165 ppm (indicated
by asterisks in Figure 3c) is attributable to the initiator which exists at the end of polymer
chains. Y-PS@MON showed clear 13C peaks of MON shells.
The 13C peak of benzyl carbon of tetra(4-ethynylphenyl)methane
building blocks appeared at 64 ppm. The 13C peaks of internal
alkyne of MON shells were observed at 85–95 ppm, matching well
with the spectra in the literature.49 The
aromatic 13C peaks of MON shells overlapped with those
of PS yolks. These observations support the expected chemical structure
of Y-PS@MON materials.

The contents of MoS2 in the
MoS2/C composites
were controlled by screening the amount of precursors and analyzed
by combustion elemental analysis. We increased the amount of (NH4)2MoS4 with a fixed quantity of Y-PS@MON
(50 mg) from 57 mg to 86, 114, and 142 mg to form MoS2/C
with 49, 58, 68, and 84 wt % MoS2, respectively. The corresponding
composites were denoted as MoS2/C-49, MoS2/C-58,
MoS2/C-68, and MoS2/C-84, respectively. As the
contents of MoS2 increased, the overall contrast of the
materials in the TEM images became darker (Figures 2f and 4a–d).

Figure 4 TEM images

and (c) MoS2/C-84, and (e) high-resolution (HR) TEM image
of MoS2/C-58. See Figure 2f for the TEM image of MoS2/C-68. (f) Normal
and (g) TEM images of microtomed control hollow carbon materials obtained
through the heat treatment of Y-PS@MON.

In a control experiment, the heat treatment of Y-PS@MON at
700
°C for 3 h under argon without the loading of precursor compounds
resulted in the formation of a hollow carbon material with a surface
area of 817 m2/g (Figures 4f,g and S3 in the Supporting Information). The inner PS yolks did not maintain their original spherical morphology
when heating at 700 °C but were disassembled, matching well with
the known properties of PS materials in the literature.21,22 (Refer to the TGA curves of PS and Y-PS@MON in Figure 1b.) Thus, the heating of PS@(NH4)2MoS4@MON at 700 °C resulted in
hollow MoS2/C composites. The hollow structure of MoS2/C-58 was further confirmed by microtoming studies, indicating
the inner void space of the MoS2/C materials (Figure S4
in the Supporting Information). HRTEM studies
showed the unique layered structure of MoS2 with an ∼0.65
nm interlayer distance (Figures 4e and S5 in the Supporting Information). The disordered MoS2 domains with 3–5 layers
were distributed over the MoS2/C-58 materials (Figure 4e).

The analysis
of N2 sorption isotherm curves showed that
as the MoS2 contents in MoS2/C increased, the
surface areas of MoS2/C-49, MoS2/C-58, MoS2/C-68, and MoS2/C-84 decreased from 330 m2/g to 304, 23, and 14 m2/g, respectively (Figure 5a,b). Interestingly, while
MoS2/C-49 and MoS2/C-58 significantly maintained
micro- and mesoporosities, the degree of porosity decreased in the
cases of MoS2/C-68 and MoS2/C-84 because of
the increased amount of MoS2.

isotherm curves

DFT method), (c) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, and
(d) PXRD patterns of the MoS2/C composites.

The electronic surroundings of Mo and S in the
MoS2/C
composites were characterized by XPS. As shown in Figure 5c, the 3d5/2 and
3d3/2 orbital peaks of Mo appeared at 228.8 and 232.1 eV,
respectively. The 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbital peaks
of S were observed at 161.7 and 162.9 eV, respectively. These observations
match well with those of MoS2 in the literature.23 According to Raman spectroscopy, as the amount
of MoS2 in the MoS2/C composites increased, ID/IG ratios increased
from 0.769 (MoS2/C-49) to 0.817 (MoS2/C-58),
0.824 (MoS2/C-68), and 0.838 (MoS2/C-84) (Figure
S6 in the Supporting Information). The
PXRD studies showed main peaks at 2θ of 14.1, 33.1, 39.8, and
58.9°, corresponding to the (002), (100), (103), and (110) diffraction
peaks of known MoS2 (JCPDS# 37-1492). As the contents of
MoS2 increased, the (002) peaks became sharper because
of an increased number of layers (Figures 5d and S5 in the Supporting Information).

Considering the sliced and well-distributed
MoS2 material
in the hollow MoS2/C composites, we studied the electrochemical
performance of the MoS2/C composites as energy storage
materials in symmetrical coin cell (CR2032-type) supercapacitors.
(Refer to Experimental Section for detailed
cell fabrication and the inset of Figure 6f.) The results of electrochemical studies
are summarized in Figure 6.

MoS2/C electrodes. Photograph of the coin cell supercapacitor
of the MoS2/C-58 electrode and Nyquist plots of the supercapacitor
before and after 5000 cycles are given in the inset of (f).

We conducted cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge
cycles of symmetrical coin cell supercapacitors in 0.5 M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte in a voltage range of −0.5
to +0.5 V. As shown in Figures 6a,b and S7 in the Supporting Information, MoS2/C-58 showed the best performance among the MoS2/C composites, with a maximum capacitance of 418 F/g at a
current density of 0.5 A/g. MoS2/C-84 showed very poor
capacitances (13 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g) because of the
overloaded MoS2 in the composites and resultant poor conductivity,
matching with the conventional results of MoS2-only materials
in the literature.24−32,34−42 Compared to MoS2/C-84, MoS2/C-68 showed increased
capacitances (304 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g). However, it
showed poor rate performance at high current densities. MoS2/C-58 showed the optimized performance, which can be attributed to
its high surface area, the microporosity of materials, and an optimal
distribution of MoS2 in the composites. When the content
of MoS2 was further reduced to MoS2/C-49, the
capacitance decreased to 320 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g,
compared to MoS2/C-58. In the CV curves of MoS2/C, the reversible redox peaks corresponding to the redox contribution
of MoS2 were observed in the range −0.2 to +0.2
V besides the typical electrostatic double-layer capacitive behavior
of carbon materials (Figure 6a). In comparison, the control hollow carbon material without
MoS2 showed conventional rectangular CV curves and a capacitance
of 135 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g (Figure 6a,b).

MoS2/C-58 showed a
good rate performance with capacitances
of 418, 333, 290, 262, 250, 239, and 235 F/g at current densities
of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 A/g, respectively (Figure 6b). When the scan rates increased from 10 to 100 mV/s, the CV curves
of MoS2/C-58 retained the mixed contribution of pseudocapacitive
property of MoS2 and the typical double-layer capacitive
behavior of carbons (Figure 6c). The charge–discharge curves of MoS2/C-58
showed slight curvatures, matching with the redox behaviors observed
in its CV curves (Figures 6d and S7 in the Supporting Information). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Nyquist plots of the
MoS2/C composites and hollow carbon materials showed that
as the contents of carbon increased, the charge-transfer resistances
increased gradually from 20 Ω (hollow carbon material) to 23
(MoS2/C-49), 37 (MoS2/C-58), 65 (MoS2/C-68), and 325 Ω (MoS2/C-84) (Figure 6e). It has been reported that
the pseudocapacitive materials including MoS2 often suffer
from poor cycling stability and thus should be assisted by secondary
composite materials.24−32,34−42

Figure 6f shows
the cycling performance of MoS2/C-58, revealing the gradual
increase of specific capacitances from 300 to 384 F/g at a current
density of 2 A/g after 5000 cycles. The Nyquist plots of MoS2/C-58 before and after 5000 cycles showed charge-transfer resistances
of 37 and 29 Ω, respectively (inset of Figure 6f). The gradual increase of the specific
capacitance of MoS2/C-58 during cycling is attributable
to the increased conductivity of materials, which is a common observation
in the performance of supercapacitors based on the MoS2/C composite materials24−32,34−42 (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). According to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM analyses,
MoS2/C-58 retrieved after the cycling test showed complete
retention of its original hollow morphology (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). The capacitance, rate
performance, and cycling stability of MoS2/C-58 are superior
or comparable to those of the recent MoS2/C composite materials.35−42 In our surveys, the capacitances of MoS2/C in the recent
literature35−42 were mostly reported in a range of 189–276 F/g at a current
density of 1 A/g. Recently, Ji et al. reported a capacitance of 472
F/g at a current density of 1 A/g.38 In
comparison, MoS2/C-58 showed a capacitance of 333 F/g at
a current density of 1 A/g. (Refer to Table S1 in the Supporting Information.)

The good electrochemical
performance of MoS2/C-58 can
be ascribed to the following points: First, the sliced MoS2 materials with 3–5 layers were distributed over the carbon
materials to maximize the utilization of active sites. Second, MoS2/C in our work has a hollow structure to induce efficient
electrochemical events over materials. Third, MoS2/C-58
maintained the high surface area and microporosity because of the
harmonized relative amounts of MoS2 and carbon. Fourth,
the pseudocapacitive property of MoS2 and the double-layer
capacitive behavior of carbon materials co-contributed to the energy
storage events, in addition to the stabilization effect of carbon
materials toward the redox behavior of MoS2.

Conclusions
This work shows that versatile organic templates can be engineered
based on MON chemistry and can be applied to develop high-performance
composite materials. Yolk–shell-type PS@MONs were prepared
by the formation of MON layers on PS@SiO2 and successive
silica etching. Because of the existence of void space in Y-PS@MON
and the microporosity of the MON shells, the MoS2 precursors
were easily incorporated into Y-PS@MON. For the incorporation of MoS2 precursors into Y-PS@MON, the MON layers were critical because
of their microporosities. PS particles without MON layers were not
efficient in the engineering of MoS2/C composites (Figure
S10 in the Supporting Information). The
heating of PS@(NH4)2MoS4@MON resulted
in hollow MoS2/C composites. As energy storage materials
for supercapacitors, MoS2/C-58 with the optimized contents
of MoS2 showed high capacitances up to 418 F/g at a 0.5
A/g current density, excellent rate performances with 235 F/g at a
10 A/g current density, and cycling stabilities during 5000 cycles.
We believe that the yolk–shell-type organic templates with
MON shells can be further applied to engineer more various inorganic
material/carbon composite materials.

Synthesis Procedure for PS@SiO2
Colloidal
PS nanospheres with positive surface charges and PS@SiO2 were prepared by the synthesis procedures in the literature.43 In our work, the following procedures were applied.
Distilled water (200 mL) was added to a 250 mL Schlenk flask, and
the solution was bubbled with argon for 30 min. PVP (Mw: 40 000, Aldrich Chem. Co., 25 mg), styrene (1.5
mL, 13 mmol), and divinylbenzene (0.030 mL, 0.27 mmol) were added.
The reaction mixture was heated at 40 °C for 30 min. After AIBA
(25 mg, 0.092 mmol) was added, the mixture was then heated at 70 °C
with stirring for 24 h. After being cooled to room temperature, a
white solution of colloidal PS spheres was obtained.

The colloidal
PS sphere solution (50 mL) was added to a 500 mL round-bottom flask.
After ethanol (350 mL) was added, the solution was stirred for 10
min. After ammonia solution (28–30%, 10 mL) was added, the
solution was stirred for 30 min. TEOS (0.50 mL, 2.2 mmol) was added
dropwise for 40 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at
room temperature. After a 1:5 mixture of methylene chloride and hexane
(900 mL) was added, the resultant PS@SiO2 particles were
retrieved by centrifugation, washed with hexane and acetone, and dried
under vacuum.

Synthesis Procedure for Y-PS@MON
PS@SiO2 (0.20 g), (PPh3)2PdCl2 (8.4 mg,
0.012 mmol), and CuI (2.3 mg, 0.012 mmol) were added to a flame-dried
50 mL Schlenk flask. After triethylamine (TEA, 30 mL) was added, the
solution was sonicated at room temperature for 2 h. After tetra(4-ethynylphenyl)methane44 (48 mg, 0.12 mmol) and 1,4-diiodobenzene (79
mg, 0.24 mmol) in TEA (10 mL) were added, the reaction mixture was
heated at 90 °C with stirring for 48 h. After the solution being
cooled to room temperature, the resultant PS@SiO2@MON particles
were retrieved by centrifugation, washed with methanol, methylene
chloride, and acetone, and dried under vacuum. The obtained PS@SiO2@MON (0.35 g) was added to a 50 mL Falcon tube. After the
diluted HF solution [25 mL, a mixture of 48–51% HF solution
(5 mL), water (10 mL), and methanol (10 mL)] was added, the reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Caution: HF solution is extremely toxic and should be very carefully handled
with special gloves. The resultant Y-PS@MON particles were retrieved
by centrifugation, washed with water, methanol, and acetone, and dried
under vacuum.

Synthesis Procedure for the MoS2/C Composites
A MoS2 precursor (NH4)2MoS4 was prepared by the synthesis procedures
in the literature.45 In our work, the following
procedures were applied.
After Na2MoO4·2H2O (5.0 g, 21
mmol), ammonia solution (28–30%, 30 mL), and water (10 mL)
were added to a 100 mL flask, the reaction mixture was stirred for
30 min. FeS (20 g, 0.23 mol) was added to a second flask. In a third
flask, CuSO4·5H2O (10 g, 40 mmol) was dissolved
in water (150 mL). The outlet of the flask with FeS was connected
to the flask with Na2MoO4 which was connected
to the flask with CuSO4. HCl (1 M) was slowly added to
the flask with FeS to generate H2S gas. The temperature
of the Na2MoO4 solution was gradually increased
to 60 °C. After the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h, it
was cooled to 0 °C using an ice bath, inducing the growth of
crystals. The crystals of (NH4)2MoS4 were collected, washed with ether, and dried under vacuum.

For the preparation of MoS2/C-68, Y-PS@MON (50 mg) and
methanol (15 mL) were added to a 50 mL Schlenk flask. The reaction
mixture was refluxed for 1 h. After the solution being cooled to room
temperature, (NH4)2MoS4 (114 mg,
0.438 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was
refluxed overnight. After methanol was removed by an evaporator, the
solid was dried under vacuum, washed with distilled water (100 mL),
and then dried under vacuum. In a furnace, PS@(NH4)2MoS4@MON was heated at 700 °C for 3 h (increasing
temperature for 2 h and maintaining the temperature for 3 h). After
being cooled to room temperature, MoS2/C-68 was collected.
For the preparation of MoS2/C-49, MoS2/C-58,
and MoS2/C-84, 57 (0.21 mmol), 86 (0.33 mmol), and 142
mg (0.547 mmol) of (NH4)2MoS4 were
used, respectively. Other synthesis procedures were same as those
for MoS2/C-68.

Cell Supercapacitors
For the engineering of two working electrodes,
a mixture of MoS2/C (80 mg), carbon black (10 mg), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP, 100 mg), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 10 mg, 77 mg of
13 wt % PVDF in NMP) was ground in a mortar. The resultant slurry
was loaded on one side of two titanium foils (0.94 cm × 0.74
cm, 0.127 mm thickness, Alfa Aesar Co.) using a spatula. The two electrodes
were dried at 80 °C in an oven for 1 h and at 110 °C in
a vacuum oven overnight. The loading amount was calculated at 1.57
mg/cm2. The cells were assembled using CR2032-type components.
After one working electrode plate was located on the cap of CR2032
cell, 0.5 M Na2SO4 (80 mg) was loaded on the
electrode plate. The separator (filter paper, No. 20 Hyundai Micro,
HD20 MN.020. 5–8 μm) was placed on the electrode plate.
The other working electrode plate was located on the separator. The
active materials on both Ti electrodes were directed to the separator.
Na2SO4 (0.5 M, 80 mg) was loaded on the electrode
plate. After a space disc and a spring were located on the electrode
plate, the cell was assembled using the other cap of the CR2032 cell
and a crimper. The next day the electrochemical tests were conducted
using an electrochemical workstation (WonATech, ZIVE SP). Specific
capacitances were calculated using the following equation: Ccell = I/[(ΔV/Δt)m], where I is the applied current (A), ΔV/Δt is the slope of the discharge curve after an IR drop at
the beginning of the discharge curve, and m is the
total mass of the electrode materials (g). The specific capacitance
of the single electrode was obtained by the equation Cs = 4Ccell.50
