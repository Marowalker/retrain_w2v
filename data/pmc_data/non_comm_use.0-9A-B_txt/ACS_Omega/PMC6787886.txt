Bisphenol A (BPA) is not only a widely
used chemical but also a
toxic pollutant, and its biodegradation in an aqueous environment
is hard due to its near insolubility in water. While the enzyme tyrosinase
can oxidize BPA in organic solvents, it does so only very slowly.
In the present study, we have found that in toluene the catalytic
activity of tyrosinase deposited onto coated mesoporous carbon is
significantly enhanced when the support is precoated with polyethylenimine.
The resultant enzymatically formed o-quinone is both
easily recoverable and potentially useful monomer. As a particular
example, the o-quinone readily reacts with diamine
in toluene to form poly(amino-quinone) polymers, which are suitable
for anticorrosion, energy storage, or biosensor applications.

1 Introduction
Bisphenol
A (BPA; Scheme 2) is
one of the highest volume industrial chemicals used as
a starting material to produce polycarbonate and epoxy resins.1 However, BPA is identified as a xenoestrogen;
as a result, in 2012, it was banned in the United States for use in
baby bottles due to its reproductive and developmental toxicity.2,3 Therefore, it is desirable to convert it into o-quinones, which easily react with nucleophiles to form polymers
for anticorrosion,4 energy storage,5−7 and biosensor8,9 and so on. In previous efforts,
Fremy’s salt was used for the oxidation of phenolic compounds.10 However, this salt is unstable, releases flammable
gases, and oxidizes extensively aromatic amines and phenols into quinones
unselectively. Regio- and chemoselective oxidations of BPA under mild
conditions have been a longstanding research goal.11

The enzyme tyrosinase (also called polyphenol oxidase;
EC 1.14.18.1)
may overcome these challenges and be a good candidate for regio- and
chemoselective oxidations of BPA under mild condition. Tyrosinase
catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenols to catechols and subsequent
dehydrogenation to o-quinones.12 Dopamine and l-tyrosine are easily oxidized by
oxygen under tyrosinase catalysis in aqueous solution. BPA has poor
solubility in water but is readily soluble in an organic solvent;13 for example, it is over an order of magnitude
more soluble in toluene than in water.14−16 Meanwhile, there is
an extra benefit that the cosubstrate oxygen has nearly 40-fold higher
solubility in toluene than in water.15 While
we have used tyrosinase deposited onto glass beads to catalyze the
oxidation of various phenols in organic solvents, the resultant enzymatic
activity toward BPA is negligible, in part due to a low available
surface area, which severely restricts the loading capacity of the
carrier.17 Therefore, in this study, we
have explored mesoporous carbon (MC) as immobilization support to
enhance tyrosinase activity toward BPA in organic solvents.

The mesoporous carbon substrate has large surface area, high pore
volume, and well-controlled pore size distribution allowing for high
loading efficiency of the tyrosinase. Furthermore, it is a stable
platform with high corrosion resistance and good thermal and mechanical
properties. However, there is a certain degree of the conformational
change of enzyme during the enzyme adsorption onto the carbon materials,
which resulted in the loss of biological activity.18 The combination of polymers with mesoporous carbon might
change its surface properties and create a biocompatible nanocomposite.
In this work, several types of polymers are used for coating the surface
of mesoporous carbon. Compared with the bare carrier, polyethylenimine
(PEI)-coated mesoporous carbon as a tyrosinase immobilization platform
improves over an order of magnitude higher enzymatic activity than
just the mesoporous carbon. BPA is successfully converted into 4,4′-(1-methylethylidene)bis(1,2-benzoquinone),
which could be used as a monomer to react with diamine to form poly(amino-quinone)
polymers for applications in anticorrosion, energy storage, and biosensors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effects of the Immobilization
Material on
the Tyrosinase Biocatalysis Ability
To study the tyrosinase
catalysis in an organic solvent, we initially employed p-cresol as a model substrate, which is more easily oxidized than
BPA.19 Its chemical structure is much simpler
than BPA, as shown in the inset of Figure 1B. We investigated the tyrosinase-catalyzed
oxidation reaction by monitoring the oxidation product of p-cresol. No significant formation of the enzymatic oxidation
product was detected with 10 mg mL–1 free tyrosinase
suspended in toluene. It is likely due to the decreased conformational
mobility of the enzyme structure and the free form of tyrosinase inactivation
in an organic solvent.20 The use of immobilized
enzyme instead of free form represents the most common method for
improving enzyme stability toward organic solvents. The immobilized
enzyme has more rigid conformation, which prevents unfolding of the
enzyme and malformation of its active site.21 First, we precipitated the tyrosinase onto the glass beads. The
enzymatic oxidation rate (defined as Vo) is the amount of the oxidation product increased per min and per
mg immobilized enzyme (measured by absorption spectra). The UV–vis
instrument can accurately measure the enzymatic oxidation rate (Vo) of up to 0.001 μM min–1 mg–1. The enzymatic oxidation rate of the immobilized
tyrosinase on glass beads was 0.02 μM min–1 mg–1 for p-cresol with 6% water
in toluene but not detectable for BPA even with over 6% water in toluene.
The limited surface area (around 0.24 m2 g–1) of glass beads might result in a low loading efficiency of the
tyrosinase.

Figure 1 (A) Vo values of tyrosinase immobilized
on mesoporous carbon and PEI-coated mesoporous carbon (the weight
ratio of mesoporous carbon/PEI is 1:1) with different water contents.
(B) Vo values of tyrosinase immobilization
onto PEI/mesoporous carbon (the weight ratio mesoporous carbon/PEI
are 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, respectively) catalyzed oxidations of p-cresol as substrate in toluene. p-Cresol
concentration for these reactions is 50 mmol L–1. Error bar means standard deviation. Vo is the amount of the oxidation product increased per min and per
mg immobilized enzyme, measured by the absorption spectra. Inset:
chemical structure of p-cresol.

Mesoporous carbon was chosen as a support to immobilize the tyrosinase
due to its large surface area (500–1000 m2 g–1).22 In this experiment,
the specific surface area of mesoporous carbon was 582 m2 g–1. When 5 mg mL–1 mesoporous
carbon was mixed with 50 mmol L–1p-cresol or 0.2 mmol L–1 BPA in aqueous solution,
it was found through UV–vis measurements that over 90% BPA
and p-cresol were adsorbed from aqueous solution
to mesoporous carbon. However, compared with aqueous solution, less
than 5% BPA and p-cresol were adsorbed from toluene
to mesoporous carbon; this makes the detection of BPA reactions easier.
However, Figure 1A
indicates that the reaction product was still not detectable even
when 8% of water was added to the toluene. During the adsorption process,
it is possible that a certain degree of conformational change in the
tyrosinase resulted in the loss of biological activity.18

Our experiments show that only mesoporous
carbon is not readily
biocompatible. Coating polymers onto carbon materials could change
its surface properties and create a biocompatible nanocomposite.23,24 Polyethylenimine (PEI), a cationic polymer, is used in encapsulating
protein antigen and DNA via electrostatic attraction.25,26 After PEI was identified as the potential candidate of the coating
material, from 1 to 8% of water was added to the toluene to test the
immobilized tyrosinase activity. Adequate water content in the reaction
medium is crucial.27 As shown in Figure 1A, higher water percentages
led to greater rates of enzymatic oxidation. However, after adding
6% water, the rate of enzymatic oxidation leveled off and decreased
slightly. After optimizing the water content, the weight ratio between
PEI and mesoporous carbon as an enzyme immobilization platform was
then investigated. The rate of enzymatic oxidation increased until
the weight ratio was 1:1 (PEI/mesopourous carbon) and then decreased
with a 2:1 ratio (Figure 1B). Therefore, the optimized condition includes a 1:1 PEI/mesoporous
carbon weight ratio for the immobilization platform with 6% of water
in the reaction medium.

2.2 Physical Characterization
of PEI/Mesoporous
Carbon and Tyrosinase Immobilization onto PEI/Mesoporous Carbon
The surface of the PEI-coated mesoporous carbon was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. Figure 2A demonstrates the
ordered pore morphology of unmodified mesoporous carbon. After PEI
was coated onto the mesoporous carbon (Figure 2B), the surface appeared rougher. This alteration
supports the conclusion that the PEI had been coated onto the surface
of the mesoporous carbon. Figure 2C shows the SEM image of the samples after immobilization
of tyrosinase onto the PEI/mesoporous carbon. The TEM images were
used for confirming the SEM results. Figure 2D,E (the enlarged view) shows uniformly distributed
spherical pores of mesoporous carbon, and its edge is very clear.
After PEI was coated onto the mesoporous carbon (Figure 2F), the edge of the nanocomposite
appears rougher. Subsequently, after immobilization of tyrosinase
onto the PEI/mesoporous carbon (Figure 2G), its edges become even rougher than the bare nanocomposite.

(H) The corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore
size distribution of MC, PEI/MC, and PEI/MC with tyrosinase.

Figure 2H shows
the pore size distribution for mesoporous carbon and the nanocomposite
by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The average
pore size of mesoporous carbon is 22 nm with a specific surface area
and pore volume of 582 m2 g–1 and 2.1
cm3 g–1, respectively. After coating
PEI on the mesoporous carbon surface, the pore size remains unchanged,
while the surface area and pore volume decreased to 505 m2 g–1 and 1.9 cm3 g–1, respectively. This suggests that the mesoporous carbon had been
coated by PEI, which slightly reduced the surface area and pore volume.
After tyrosinase immobilization onto the PEI-coated mesoporous carbon
surface, its surface area and pore volume further decreased to 200
m2 g–1 and 1.3 cm3 g–1, respectively, indicating that the tyrosinase had been immobilized
onto the surface of coated mesoporous carbon.

2.3 Coating
Materials Influence the Immobilized
Tyrosinase Biocatalysis Ability
To understand the role played
by the PEI coating, several different polymers were also used as coating
materials. Table 1 shows
that the rates of enzymatic oxidation after tyrosinase immobilization
onto poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated mesoporous carbon, polyacrylate
(PAL)-coated mesoporous carbon, diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DEAE-cellulose)-coated
mesoporous carbon, cellulose-coated mesoporous carbon, carboxymethyl-cellulose
(CM-cellulose)-coated mesoporous carbon, bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated
mesoporous carbon, and lysozyme-coated mesoporous carbon were 0, 0.089,
0.092, 0.086, 0.037, 0.062, and 0.054 μM min–1 mg–1, respectively. The relative deviation numbers
indicated that the reproducibility of the experimental procedure was
reliable.

Table 1 Oxidation of p-Cresol
by Tyrosinase Immobilized on Mesoporous Carbon or Coated Mesoporous
Carbon
We divided the coating material
into three groups for a better understanding. The three traditional
polymers can be categorized based on the charges on their surface:
PEI (positive charge), PEG (neutral), and PAL (negative charge). Table 1 shows that the rate
of enzymatic oxidation after tyrosinase immobilization was highest
for the PEI-coated mesoporous carbon. The electrostatic attractions
likely assist the coating of the positively charged PEI onto the negatively
charged mesoporous carbon. The abundant amine groups on PEI (where
the positive charges are from) could also electrostatically attract
the negative charges of tyrosinase (as shown in Scheme 1). In this way, high catalytic efficiency
of the immobilized tyrosinase could be achieved. PAL, an anionic polymer
with negatively charged carboxylic groups in the main chain, had the
next highest rate of oxidation. Even though PAL is a negatively charged
polymer, previous studies have found that PAL can bind with mesoporous
carbon to form a hydrogel28−30 through hydrogen bonding. The
photograph of Scheme 1F also verified this. The retained water in the hydrogel could be
beneficial for keeping the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase. However,
there was electrostatic repulsion between PAL and the tyrosinase,31 limiting its catalytic efficiency. In the case
of PEG, which is a neutral polymer, it was found that the catalytic
efficiency of the immobilized tyrosinase was undetectable after PEG
coating onto the mesoporous carbon. The PEG coating did not improve
the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized tyrosinase, possibly due
to the fact that there was not enough tyrosinase loaded onto the surface,
as PEG was used to as a steric barrier for avoiding proteins sticking
onto the surface of the materials in the previous research.32,33

Carbon
The
brown dots represent the
coating materials in the scheme.

The second
polymer coating group consists of three differently
charged cellulose, and their chemical structures are shown in Table 1. Table 1 also shows that the rate of
enzymatic oxidation after tyrosinase immobilization was highest for
the positively charged DEAE-cellulose, corroborating the results from
the first polymer screening. The negatively charged CM-cellulose-coated
mesoporous carbon had the lowest activity among the cellulose coatings,
possibly due to electrostatic repulsion.34 Neutral cellulose-coated mesoporous carbon had similar activity
to PAL, likely due to its ample hydroxyl groups, which could create
a similar hydrogen-bonding network to maintain the catalytic efficiency
of the immobilized tyrosinase.35 These
results indicate that electrostatic attraction plays an important
role in immobilizing tyrosinase, while other factors, such as hydrogen
bonding or steric barrier, are also vital for immobilization efficiency.

In addition to using synthetic polymers as coating materials, we
also used proteins to coat mesoporous carbon as previous reports showed
that protein coatings could provide a biocompatible surface for immobilizing
enzymes.36,37 Two common proteins, lysozyme and bovine
serum albumin (BSA), were selected for coatings on the surface of
mesoporous carbon. Table 1 shows that the rates of enzymatic oxidation were similar
for both lysozyme and BSA. Lysozyme (molecular weight: 14.3 kDa) is
thermally stable and its isoelectric point is 11.35.38 Thus, lysozyme likely played a similar role as PEI in creating
a layer-by-layer structure of negative and positive charges. BSA (molecular
weight: 66.5 kDa) is a serum albumin protein and its isoelectric point
is 4.7.39 It is possible that the positively
charged residues on the BSA surface interacted with the surface of
mesoporous carbon, allowing the BSA to be stably adsorbed.40 As both BSA and lysozyme could be coated onto
mesoporous carbon by a positively charged subdomain, their ample hydroxyl
and amino groups could create a hydrogen-bonding network to maintain
the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized tyrosinase. The oxidation
rates of lysozyme-coated mesoporous carbon had a slightly higher activity
than those of BSA-coated mesoporous carbon. These results corroborate
that electrostatic attraction plays the main role in immobilizing
tyrosinase.

2.4 Oxidation of BPA Using
the Immobilized Tyrosinase
After optimizing the experimental
conditions with p-cresol, the tyrosinase immobilization
onto PEI/mesoporous carbon
was used as a biocatalyst for the oxidation of BPA in toluene. The
rate of enzymatic oxidation for BPA (10 mmol L–1) in toluene with 6% water was 0.039 μM min–1 mg–1. The rate of enzymatic oxidation for BPA
is lower than that for p-cresol due to its stronger
steric hindrance. Furthermore, the rates of enzymatic oxidation for
BPA (10 mmol L–1) in chloroform, acetone, ethanol,
and methanol with 6% water were 0.021, 0, 0, and 0 μM min–1 mg–1, respectively. As shown in Table 2, compared with the
ozone oxidation of BPA, chemical oxidation of BPA, photocatalytic
oxidation of BPA, and electrochemical oxidation of BPA, the enzyme
oxidation of BPA shows both high selectivity and almost an order of
magnitude higher efficiency. More importantly, tyrosinase oxidation
of BPA is the safest method among all of them. After 60 min of reaction
with the immobilized tyrosinase, BPA was converted into 4-[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methyl-ethyl]-1,2-benzoquinone
and 4,4′-(1-methylethylidene)bis(1,2-benzoquinone) (o-quinone product) as oxidation products determined by liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (Figure 3). The ratio between the two
products was approximately 1:1 (Figure 3A). After 10 h of reaction, the mass spectrometry results
showed that all of the oxidation product was the o-quinone product (Figure 3B). Furthermore, NMR has been tested for BPA and bisquinone
(Figure S1). In the 1H NMR spectrum
of the bisquinone [1H NMR, 6.44 (2H, dd, J = 10.3 and 0.7 Hz, H6), 6.48 (2H, dd, J = 2.4 and
0.7 Hz, H3), 6.65 (2H, dd, J = 10.3 and 2.4 Hz, H5)],
the signals of 4-substituted phenol were not observed, but only signals
of a 1,2-quinone moiety and a singlet methyl group were observed.
Together with the data of the high-resolution mass measurement, this
compound was identified as the bisquinone derivative of bisphenol
A.

The reaction mechanism is
shown in Scheme 2. The o-quinone product
is stable in toluene solution as a monomer; in contrast,
it is prone to aggregation in aqueous solution.41 Therefore, this strategy of converting BPA in toluene solution
to o-quinone will allow controllable polymerization
and potentially can be very useful for future applications.

Scheme 2 Possible
Reaction Pathways for Bisphenol A Oxidation by Immobilized
Tyrosinase under Oxygen
This o-quinone product has four carbonyl groups,
which may further react with a variety of nucleophiles in various
pathways. Well-known nucleophiles, such as amines, may react with
the o-quinone to form adducts either by the Michael
addition or Schiff base reactions, as shown in Scheme 3. Therefore, in this study, we used 4,4′-(1-methylethylidene)bis(1,2-benzoquinone)
and hexamethylenediamine to study the cross-linking chemistry, and
the reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 4D. After adding hexamethylenediamine into
4,4′-(1-methylethylidene)bis(1,2-benzoquinone) in toluene,
the color changed from yellow to purple (Figure 4C), indicating that a reaction had taken
place, and the poly(amino-quinone) with a honeycomb-like nanostructure
was formed (as shown in Figure 4A). Figure 4B shows the SEM image of the polymer showing lots of nanopores on
the surface of this polymer, resulting in a rough surface. Figure 5A shows the branched
polymer formed when trilysine, a short peptide with an amino group,
reacted with 4,4′-(1-methylethylidene)bis(1,2-benzoquinone)
in toluene (the reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 5B). In this way, the 4,4′-(1-methylethylidene)bis(1,2-benzoquinone)
serves as another condensing reagent like the commonly used carbodiimide
reagents (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride).
Because it has quinone groups on both sides, it can covalently bind
to amino-functionalized surfaces on one side and bind to peptides
(enzymes) on the other side; thus, it can be used for anchoring peptides
on surfaces conveniently. Scheme 4 shows an example with the commonly used sepharose
particle as an anchoring substrate. This bisquinone enriches the immobilization
method for proteins or peptides as bifunctional reagents. Furthermore,
polymers with quinone groups can easily adhere to metals and alloys4,42 and can be used for anticorrosion application, as well.

3 Conclusions
This work developed a method
to selectively oxidize BPA under mild
conditions. The model enzyme (tyrosinase) was directly immobilized
onto the surface of mesoporous carbon via physical adsorption ability.
The rate of enzymatic oxidation was improved by coating the mesoporous
carbon with various polymers. Among these coating materials, PEI resulted
in the highest rate of oxidation due to its ability to form a charge
sandwich structure to protect tyrosinase. The final oxidation product
of BPA is 4,4′-(1-methylethylidene)bis(1,2-benzoquinone), which
can be used as a monomer to form the poly(amino-quinone) polymers
by the Schiff base reactions. It can be anticipated that potentially
it could be used as a BPA replacement in many of current applications.
This research also develops an effective coating strategy, which can
make mesoporous carbon a promising immobilization platform for applications
in biocatalysis, biosensing, and drug delivery and will facilitate
the development of high-catalytic-efficiency enzyme bioelectronic
devices and biofuel battery.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
BPA, para-cresol (p-cresol), and other chemicals were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich, and their purity was higher than 99%. Mushroom
tyrosinase (50 kU) was from Sigma-Aldrich as a solid with a specific
activity of 2430 unit mg–1 (1 unit is defined as
the enzyme activity resulting in an increase in absorbance at 280
nm of 0.001 at pH 6.5 at 25 °C in a 3 mL reaction solution containing l-tyrosine). Polyethylenimine (PEI, Mn 1200), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mn 1500), polyacrylate (PAL, Mn 1250),
diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DEAE-cellulose, microgranular), carboxymethyl-cellulose
(CM-cellulose, microgranular), cellulose (fiber), hen egg-white lysozyme
(Mw: 14.4 kDa), and bovine serum albumin
(BSA, Mw: 66 kDa) were also from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Instrumentations
Scanning electron
microscope images were obtained by a high-resolution SEM (Zeiss Merlin,
Germany) with a resolution of 0.8 nm at 15 kV and 1.4 nm at 1 kV.
Transmission electron microscope images were obtained from an FEI
Tecnai multipurpose TEM (ThermoFisher Scientific). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS, Agilent
6000 series) was used to monitor the mass of the product. Absorption
spectroscopy was detected by a UV–vis spectrophotometry (TheromFisher
nanodrop 2000c).

4.3 Preparation of PEI/Mesoporous
Carbon Nanocomposite
and Immobilization of Tyrosinase
Mesoporous carbon was synthesized
using 22 nm silica nanospheres as template. The synthesis of monodisperse
silica nanospheres (22 nm) was based on the so-called “Stober
method” reported by our previous method.43 In short, tetraethoxysilane, l-lysine, and H2O were mixed together with a weight ratio of 1:0.01:78. The
above-mixed solution was stirred for 12 h under 80 °C to obtain
22 nm silica nanospheres. Mesoporous carbon was synthesized using
the obtained 22 nm silica nanospheres as template according to our
previously reported procedure.43 The procedure
was as follows: 1.0 g dried silica spheres were impregnated with a
0.5 mM Ni(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous
solution and then dried at 45 °C. After being ground in an agate
mortar, these silica particles were pressed into pellets. Then, silica
pellets were immersed into the preliminarily polymerized polystyrene,
followed by heating the composite at 160 °C for 24 h to allow
the impregnation of polystyrene into the interstices of the silica
template. Thereafter, the composite was allowed to undergo pyrolysis/carbonization
at 950 °C for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere and cooled down
to room temperature. The silica spheres were removed from the composite
using a 20% hydrogen fluoride solution for 24 h and drying at 120
°C to yield the final graphitized ordered mesoporous carbon.

To form the PEI-coated mesoporous carbon, 20 mL of 5 mg mL–1 mesoporous carbon was mixed with 20 mL of 5 mg mL–1 PEI and stirred at room temperature for 18 h. Then the sediment
was separated by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 25 min, washed with
deionized water thrice, recovered by decantation, and dried at room
temperature for 3 h to obtain the final PEI/mesoporous carbon nanocomposite.

Solid tyrosinase (2 mg) was dissolved in 0.2 mL of 50 mmol L–1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.0, and then
10 mg of PEI/mesoporous carbon was added. The sticky mixture was spread
on a watch glass and left to dry at room temperature for 2 h. The
tyrosinase immobilization onto other materials was prepared following
a similar protocol.

4.4 Monitoring of Tyrosinase
Activity
The time course for tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation
of p-cresol or BPA in organic solvents was monitored
using a UV–vis
Nanodrop 2000C spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the
following procedure. p-Cresol (1 mL of 50 mmol L–1) in an organic solvent was added into a 5 mL round-bottom
flask, followed by the addition of 5 μL of 50 mmol L–1 PBS (pH 7.0) and 1 mg of the immobilized tyrosinase, and the suspension
was mixed using a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm and 25 °C. Aliquots
of the liquid were periodically withdrawn, and their absorption spectra
were recorded in the range of 400–600 nm.
