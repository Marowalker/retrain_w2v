Lithium
manganese oxides have received much attention as positive
electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. In this study, a post-spinel
material, CaFe2O4-type LiMn2O4 (CF-LMO), was synthesized at high pressures above 6 GPa,
and its crystal structure and electrochemical properties were examined.
CF-LMO exhibits a one-dimensional (1D) conduction pathway for Li ions,
which is predicted to be superior to the three-dimensional conduction
pathway for these ions. The stoichiometric LiMn2O4 spinel (SP-LMO) was decomposed into three phases of Li2MnO3, MnO2, and Mn2O3 at 600 °C and then started to transform into the CF-LMO structure
above 800 °C. The rechargeable capacity (Qrecha) of the sample synthesized at 1000 °C was limited
to ∼40 mA h·g–1 in the voltage range
between 1.5 and 5.3 V because of the presence of a small amount of
Li2MnO3 phase in the sample (=9.1 wt %). In
addition, the Li-rich spinels, Li[LixMn2–x]O4 with x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.333, were also employed for the synthesis of CF-LMO.
The sample prepared from x = 0.2 exhibited a Qrecha value exceeding 120 mA h·g–1 with a stable cycling performance, despite the presence of large
amounts of the phases Li2MnO3, MnO2, and Mn2O3. Details of the structural transformation
from SP-LMO to CF-LMO and the effect of Mn ions on the 1D conduction
pathway are discussed.

Introduction
The demand for high-power
lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high-energy
densities has been increasing in response to efforts to realize the
widespread use of pure electric vehicles and stationary energy storage
systems. Lithium manganese oxide LiMn2O4, which
crystallizes into a spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group, has been regarded as a candidate material
for the positive electrode of these LIBs, owing to its environmental
friendliness and the natural abundance of the element Mn.1−5Figure 1a shows a
schematic of the crystal structure of the LiMn2O4 spinel (SP-LMO), in which Li+ ions occupy the tetrahedral
8a site and Mn3+/Mn4+ ions occupy the octahedral
16d site in cubic close-packed arrays of O2– ions.4,5 Bond valence sum analyses on SP-LMO indicated that the Li+ ions at the 8a site exhibit a three-dimensional (3D) conduction
pathway during charge and discharge reactions.6

Figure 1 Crystal
structures of (a) SP-LMO with 0 ≤ x ≤
0.333 and (b) CF-LMO. The space groups of SP-LMO and CF-LMO
are Fd3̅m and Pnma, respectively.

SP-LMO is known to undergo
structural transformation into the CaFe2O4-type
LiMn2O4 (CF-LMO)
structure with the Pnma space group at high pressure
(HP) of 6 GPa, which is referred to as a post-spinel structure.7 As illustrated in Figure 1b, CF-LMO possesses so-called double rutile
chains formed by distorted MnO6 octahedra through edge-sharing
or corner-sharing.7−13 Furthermore, CF-LMO indicates a one-dimensional (1D) conduction
pathway for Li+ ions coordinated by eight O2– ions. According to first-principles density functional theory calculations,11−13 the mobility of the Li+ ions in CF-LMO is higher than
that in typical LIB materials, such as SP-LMO, probably as a result
of lower electrostatic repulsions and lower diffusion barriers in
the lattice. Nevertheless, little is known about the actual electrochemical
performance of CF-LMO, although Yamaura et al.7 demonstrated a limited discharge profile; that is, the voltage of
the CF-LMO/Li cell decreased almost linearly from 3.0 to 1.0 V versus
Li+/Li, with a discharge capacity (Qdis) of ∼15 mA h·g–1. Moreover,
Mamiya and co-workers showed structural and electrochemical properties
of CF-LMO compounds, which were prepared by an ion-exchange method
from CF-type NaMn2O4.14−16 However, electrochemical
properties of ion-exchange synthesized compounds would differ from
those of solid-state synthesized equivalents because of residual parent
ions and/or vacancies in the lattice.17,18

We thus
again synthesized CF-LMO samples by the HP method SP-LMO,
and examined their electrochemical properties across the entire voltage
range between ∼0 and 5.3 V. This information was expected to
be useful for understanding the inter-relationship between the crystal
structure and electrochemical properties of various lithium manganese
oxides19 and for the subsequent development
of high-power LIB materials with high-energy densities. The conversion
of SP-LMO into nearly single-phase CF-LMO is expected to occur at
a pressure of 6 GPa and at a temperature of 1000 °C, based on
the previous report.7 However, we investigated
the temperature dependence of the synthesis from room temperature
(RT) to 1000 °C because the mechanism of the transformation and
electrochemical properties of intermediate phases have been not clarified
yet. Moreover, we also employed “Li-rich SP-LMO” compounds
as a starting material for the HP synthesis. This is because a slightly
Li-poor phase was obtained in the previous solid-state synthesized
CF-LMO.7 As shown in Figure 1a, the Mn3+/Mn4+ ions
at the 16d site can be substituted by Li+ ions, forming
a series of spinel compounds with the general formula of Li[LixMn2–x]O4 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.333.4,5 Hereafter, we denote the samples as SP-LMO(x =
XXX), where XXX represents the value of x in Li[LixMn2–x]O4. Both HP and high-temperature (HT) treatment on SP-LMO(x > 0) could clarify effects of Li+ ions at
the
16d site on the structural transformation and electrochemical properties
of CF-LMO. Consequently, CF-LMO indicated a rechargeable capacity
(Qrecha) of ∼40 mA h·g–1 in the voltage range between 1.5 and 5.3 V, whereas Qrecha exceeds 380 mA h·g–1 in the voltage range between 0.02 and 3.0 V. The value of Qrecha in the voltage range between 1.5 and 5.3
V was increased by employing samples with x >
0.
The mechanism of the transformation and its electrochemical properties
via the 1D and 3D pathways are discussed and compared.

Results
Characterization
We first characterized SP-LMO samples
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Figure S1 shows the XRD patterns of the SP-LMO(x =
0), SP-LMO(x = 0.1), SP-LMO(x =
0.2), and SP-LMO(x = 0.333) samples. The SP-LMO(x = 0.333) sample was the only sample that did not consist
of a single phase; instead, it was a mixture of the spinel and Li2MnO3 phases. This is clearly indicated by the change
in the cubic lattice parameter (ac) of
the spinel phase, which was determined by Rietveld analyses with the
software RIETAN-FP20 (Figure S2).

Table 1 summarizes synthetic conditions of samples, such as
applied pressures and heating temperatures. The SP-LMO and Li2MnO3 samples were subjected to the HP/HT treatment
in the pressure range between 6 and 12 GPa, and in the temperature
range between RT and 1000 °C. Hereafter, the samples are represented
as HP(XXX, YYY °C), where XXX and YYY correspond to the SP-LMO(XXX)
or Li2MnO3 precursor for the HP/HT treatment
and the heating temperature during the synthesis, respectively. Only
samples #2 and #3 are denoted as HP(x = 0, 6 GPa,
1000 °C) and HP(x = 0, 8 GPa, 1000 °C),
respectively.

Figure S3 shows the XRD patterns of
the HP(x = 0, 6 GPa, 1000 °C) and HP(x = 0, 8 GPa, 1000 °C) samples, to clarify the required
pressure for the transformation. The HP(x = 0, 6
GPa, 1000 °C) sample retained the spinel structure, even after
it was heated at 1000 °C. In addition, the HP(x = 0, 8 GPa, 1000 °C) sample indicated broad diffraction lines,
although it was assigned as the CF-LMO structure. The required pressure
for the transformation seemed to be above 8 GPa, which was slightly
greater than the reported value (=6 GPa).7 Hereafter, we fixed the applied pressure to 12 GPa for all samples.

Particle Morphology
Figure 2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the SP-LMO(x = 0), HP(x = 0, 200 °C), HP(x = 0, 600 °C), and
HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) samples. The SEM images of
the HP(x = 0, RT), HP(x = 0, 400
°C), and HP(x = 0, 800 °C) samples are
shown in Figure S4. The primary particles
of the SP-LMO(x = 0) sample appear smooth and flat
with an average size of ∼5 μm. The application of HP/HT
caused individual primary particles to aggregate together to form
large secondary particles with an average size of ∼10 μm.
The only exception is the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C)
sample, the primary particles of which are isolated from each other
with their average size decreasing to ∼2 μm. Similar
changes in the particle morphology and size were previously observed
for HP/HT treated Li[Li1/3Ti5/3]O4.21 In fact, its particle morphology and
size drastically changed above 400 °C, accompanied with a transformation
from the spinel to the columbite structure.21 Hence, the SP-LMO(x = 0) sample is expected to
undergo a structural transformation above 800 °C.

SP-LMO(x = 0), (b) HP(x = 0, 200
°C), (c) HP(x = 0, 600
°C), and (d) HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) samples.

Crystal Structure
Figure 3 shows the
XRD patterns of the HP(x = 0, RT), HP(x = 0, 200 °C), HP(x = 0, 400 °C), HP(x = 0, 600 °C),
HP(x = 0, 800 °C), and HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) samples. The HP(x = 0, RT),
HP(x = 0, 200 °C), and HP(x = 0, 400 0C) samples retain the spinel structure, although individual
diffraction lines become broader as the heating temperature increases.
The ac values of the HP(x = 0, RT), HP(x = 0, 200 °C), and HP(x = 0, 400 °C) samples were calculated to be 8.2311(3),
8.2250(3), and 8.2236(5) Å, respectively, which are slightly
lower than the initial ac [=8.2404(1)
Å] of the SP-LMO(x = 0) sample. The HP(x = 0, 600 °C) sample no longer has the spinel structure
and consists of a mixture of three phases; that is, Li2MnO3 with the C2/m space
group, MnO2 pyrolusite (rutile) with the P42/mnm space group, and Mn2O3 bixbyite with the Pbcn space group.
The CF-LMO phase makes its appearance in the HP(x = 0, 800 °C) sample where it exists alongside the former three
phases. Transformation from the SP-LMO to the CF-LMO structure is
achieved in the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample, as
predicted by the results of the SEM observations. However, the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample still comprises a mixture of
the CF-LMO and Li2MnO3 phases. To clarify the
details of the crystal structures of the HP(x = 0,
YYY °C) samples, we performed Rietveld analyses on the XRD data
obtained at the synchrotron radiation facility. The results of the
HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample are presented in Figure 3g and Table 2. Furthermore, the results of
the HP(x = 0, 400 °C), HP(x = 0, 600 °C), and HP(x = 0, 800 °C) samples
are summarized in Figure S5 and Tables S1–S3. We assumed the full occupancies
(gs) of Li, Mn, and O atoms except for the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample. The weight fractions of the
Li2MnO3, MnO2, and Mn2O3 phases were 31.8, 24.1, and 44.1%, respectively, in
the HP(x = 0, 600 °C) sample [see Figure 3h]. The total Li/Mn ratio is
calculated to be 0.49 by using these weight fractions, which is consistent
with the initial Li/Mn ratio (=0.50). This supports the validity of
the full gs of Li and Mn atoms in the HP(x = 0, 600 °C) sample. The weight fraction of the CF-LMO
phase is limited to 35.2% in the HP(x = 0, 800 °C)
sample but increases to 90.9% in the HP(x = 0, 1000
°C) sample. The presence of the Li2MnO3 phase in HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) unambiguously
means a decrease in g at the Li (4c) site [g(Li)] in the CF-LMO structure. Because it is difficult
to determine the value of g(Li) from the XRD data,
we assigned a fixed value of g(Li) = 0.75 based on
the initial Li/Mn ratio (Table 2). The lattice parameters of the CF-LMO phase are determined
to be ao = 8.8146(3) Å, bo = 2.8299(1) Å, and co = 10.6247(5) Å, all of which are comparable with those for
solid-state synthesized CF-LMO,7 but are
slightly different from those for ion-exchange synthesized CF-LMO.16

We performed
magnetic susceptibility (χ) measurement of the HP(x = 0, 1000
°C) sample to clarify its chemical composition. Figure S6 shows the temperature dependence of χ under
a magnetic field of 10 kOe. An approximately linear feature, that
is, Curie–Weiss characteristic, was observed above 200 K, and
then χ was fitted with a following equation 1  where N is the number
density
of Mn ions, μeff is the effective magnetic moment
of Mn ions, kB is the Boltzmann’s
constant, T is the absolute temperature, θ
is the Weiss temperature, and χ0 is the temperature-independent
term. The μeff, θ, and χ0 values
were determined to be 4.22(4) μB, −192(4)
K, and 1.8(6) × 10–4 emu·mol–1, respectively. The μeff of 4.22 μB corresponds to that of spinel-structured Li0.7Mn2O4.22 This supports
the validity of the Rietveld analysis of the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample, in which we assumed the Li composition
of CF-LMO phase as 0.75. Further neutron diffraction measurements
could clarify the g(Li) value in the CF-LMO phase.

Figure 4 shows the
XRD patterns of (a) HP(x = 0.1, 1000 °C), (b)
HP(x = 0.2, 1000 °C), (c) HP(x = 0.333, 1000 °C), and (d) HP(Li2MnO3, 1000 °C). The HP(x = 0.1, 1000 °C) sample
consists of a mixture of four phases: CF-LMO, Li2MnO3, MnO2, and Mn2O3, as is
the case with the HP(x = 0, 800 °C) sample [Figure 3e]. The compositions
of the HP(x = 0.2, 1000 °C) sample and HP(x = 0.333, 800 °C) sample are similar; however, the
XRD intensities of the MnO2 phase increase with x. Incomplete transformation to the CF-LMO structure is
probably caused by the stability of the Li2MnO3 phase. As seen in Figure 4d, Li2MnO3 retains its monoclinic structure
even after HP/HT treatment at 12 GPa and 1000 °C.

The results of the Rietveld analyses
of the HP(x = 0.1, 1000 °C) sample are presented
in Figure 4e and Table 3. These structural
parameters are slightly different
from those for the single-phase of Li2MnO3,23 MnO2,24 and Mn2O3,25 indicating
the presence of defects and/or dislocations in the sample. The results
of the Rietveld analyses of the HP(x = 0.2, 1000
°C) and HP(x = 0.333, 1000 °C) samples
are summarized in Figure S7 and Tables S4 and S5. As seen in Figure 4f, the weight fraction of the
CF-LMO phase decreases with x; for instance, the
weight fractions of the CF-LMO, Li2MnO3, MnO2, and Mn2O3 phases are 23.5, 27.4, 25.2,
and 23.9%, respectively, in the HP(x = 0.333, 1000
°C) sample. The deviation from Li/Mn = 0.50 in the initial SP-LMO
sample stabilizes the Li2MnO3 phase, resulting
in the decrease in the weight ratio of the CF-LMO phase.

Electrochemical Properties
Figure 5 shows the
charge and discharge curves of
the Li cells with the HP(x = 0, RT), HP(x = 0, 200 °C), HP(x = 0, 600 °C), HP(x = 0, 800 °C), and HP(x = 0, 1000
°C) samples. The cells were operated in the voltage range between
1.5 and 5.3 V. The voltage of the HP(x = 0, RT)/Li
cell rapidly increases from 3.2 to ∼4.0 V at the beginning
of the charge reaction, after which the voltage remains almost constant
at ∼4.0 and 4.2 V. The latter voltage plateau corresponds to
a two-phase reaction between two cubic phases with different ac values.1−3 The charge capacity (Qcha) is 164.5 mA h·g–1 at the first
cycle, while the subsequent Qdis reaches
249.0 mA h·g–1, because of the excess discharge
reaction between the cubic and tetragonal phases at ∼2.9 V.1 The overall electrochemical reaction of LiMn2O4 can be represented by 2  

Figure 5 Charge and discharge curves of Li cells with the (a) HP(x = 0, RT), (b) HP(x = 0, 200 °C),
(c) HP(x = 0, 600 °C), (d) HP(x = 0, 800 °C), and (e) HP(x = 0, 1000 °C)
samples, operated in the voltage range between 1.5 and 5.3 V. The
charge and discharge curves of the first cycle are indicated as red
lines. The dQcha/dV (or
dQdis/dV) curves of the
initial second cycles of the HP(x = 0, RT) and HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) samples are shown in (f,g), respectively.
(h) Charge and discharge curves of the HP(x = 0,
1000 °C)/Li cell operated in the voltage range between 0.02 and
3.0 V. The values of Qdis and Qcha as a function of the number of cycles are
shown in the inset.

Because the theoretical
capacity (Qtheo) for the one-electron
transfer reaction is calculated to be 148.2
mA h·g–1, the charge reaction at the first
cycle includes side reactions such as the decomposition of the electrolyte
at high voltages. The charge and discharge curves after the second
cycle resemble those in the first cycle, as seen for the dQcha/dV (or dQdis/dV) curves shown in Figure 5f. The characteristic behavior
of SP-LMO can be observed in the charge and discharge curves of the
HP(x = 0, 200 °C)/Li cell; however, Qcha (Qdis) drastically
decreases cycle-by-cycle. This is probably because of defects in the
crystal lattice, as understood by the decrease in ac.

The charge and discharge curves of the HP(x =
0, 600 °C)/Li cell are significantly different from those of
the HP(x = 0, RT)/Li and HP(x =
0, 200 °C)/Li cells [Figure 5c]. The voltage rapidly increases from ∼3.1
to ∼4.5 V at the beginning of the charge reaction, after which
the voltage remains constant at ∼4.5 V. The Qcha is 43.9 mA h·g–1, which is
∼100 mA h·g–1 lower than those of the
HP(x = 0, RT) and HP(x = 0, 200
°C) samples. The subsequent discharge and charge curves do not
indicate the plateau at ∼4.5 V, but exhibit an almost monotonic
voltage change with Qcha (or Qdis). The Qrecha is limited
to ∼40 mA h·g–1, although stable cycleability
is obtained until 30 cycles. The electrochemical properties of the
HP(x = 0, 800 °C) and HP(x =
0, 1000 °C) samples are similar to that of the HP(x = 0, 600 °C) sample; that is, only the charge curve at the
first cycle differs from the subsequent charge curves, and the charge
(discharge) voltage changes almost monotonically with Qcha (Qdis). Moreover, as shown
in Figure 4g, the oxidation
peak at 4.58 V was only observed in the charge curve of the first
cycle. This indicates that the impurity phases of Li2MnO3, MnO2, and Mn2O3 do not
strongly influence the electrochemical properties of the HP(x = 0, 600 °C), HP(x = 0, 800 °C),
and HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) samples. Note that the
Li2MnO3 phase is essentially electrochemically
inactive because of the difficulty in further oxidizing the Mn4+ ions unless an oxygen loss from the lattice.26 In addition, MnO227 and Mn2O328 are electrochemically active only for nanosized compounds.

As shown in Figure S8, the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample maintains the CF-LMO structure
even after the cycling test. This result differs from that of ion-exchanged
synthesized CF-LMO compound, which decomposed into an amorphous-like
phase after the cycle test.16 Two main
diffraction lines at 2θ = 24.612° and 25.434° shift
to lower (=24.558°) and higher (=25.488°) diffraction angles,
respectively, after the cycling test. This supports that the CF-LMO
phase participates in the electrochemical reactivity of the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample.

The performance of the
samples as a negative electrode was also
investigated. Figure 5h shows the discharge and charge curves of the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C)/Li cell operated in the voltage range between
0.02 and 3.0 V. Figure S9 shows the discharge
and charge curves when the discharge cutoff voltage was set to 1.0
V. These electrochemical measurements were performed using a copper
mesh as a current collector, to avoid the formation of Li–Al
alloys at ∼1.0 V.29 The discharge
curve of the first cycle maintains a constant voltage at ∼0.5
V, whereas the charge curve of the first cycle indicates a monotonic
change until ∼1.2 V. The Qdis and Qcha of the first cycle are 1209 and 387.5 mA
h·g–1, respectively. This electrochemical property
reminds us of the conversion reaction to form the metal and the Li2O phase.30 In the case of the LiMn2O4 composition, the conversion reaction is represented
by 3  where Qtheo is
calculated to be 1040 mA h·g–1. The difference
between the observed Qdis and Qtheo was attributed to the decomposition of
the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder during the first cycle.
The Qdis (or Qcha) value rapidly decreases cycle–by-cycle, as seen in the inset
of Figure 5h. Because
the average particle size of the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C)
sample (=∼2 μm) is too large to allow the conversion
reaction to take place,30 the large volume
change during the discharge and charge reactions is considered to
degrade the electrical contact between the particles. Note that the Qdis (or Qcha) value
was limited to ∼15 mA h·g–1, when the
conversion reaction is excluded (Figure S9).

Figure 6 shows
the
charge and discharge curves of the Li cells with (a) HP(x = 0.1, 1000 °C), (b) HP(x = 0.2, 1000 °C),
and (c) HP(x = 0.333, 1000 °C), operated in
the voltage range between 1.5 and 5.3 V. The charge and discharge
curves of the HP(x = 0.1, 1000 °C) sample are
similar to those of the HP(x = 0,1000 °C) sample.
However, its Qcha (or Qdis) is approximately twice as large as that of the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample. The Qcha and Qdis values are slightly
increased for the HP(x = 0.2, 1000 °C) sample;
that is, Qcha = 107.8 mA h·g–1 and Qdis = 125.9 mA h·g–1 for the first cycle. As shown in Figure 4f, the weight fractions of
the CF-LMO, Li2MnO3, MnO2, and Mn2O3 phases are 37.2, 19.4, 22.1, and 21.3%, respectively,
in the sample. This weight ratio is comparable with that in the HP(x = 0, 800 °C) sample, for which the Qcha (Qdis) value was limited
to ∼40 mA h·g–1 [Figure 5d].

Figure 6 Charge and discharge curves of the Li cells
with (a) HP(x = 0.1, 1000 °C), (b) HP(x = 0.2,
1000 °C), and (c) HP(x = 0.333, 1000 °C),
operated in the voltage range between 1.5 and 5.3 V. The charge and
discharge curves of the first cycle are indicated as red lines. For
the HP(x = 0.2, 1000 °C) sample, the dQcha/dV (or dQdis/dV) curves of the initial second
cycles are shown in (d). Cycling performance of the four different
HP(XXX, 1000 °C) samples is plotted in (e).

Comparison of the dQcha/dV (or dQdis/dV) curves
clarified the differences in the electrochemical properties between
the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) and HP(x = 0.2, 1000 °C) samples. Namely, as shown in Figure 6d, one oxidation peak at 3.42
V and two reduction peaks at 2.92 and 3.47 V are observed for the
HP(x = 0.2, 1000 °C) sample. Contrary to this,
as seen in Figure 5g, one oxidation peak at 3.21 V and only one reduction peak at 2.88
V were observed for the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample.
This implies that the respective electrochemical reactions that the
two HP(1000 °C) samples undergo differ from one another. In any
case, the cycling performance of the four different HP(XXX, 1000 °C)
samples is quite stable, as seen from Figure 6e. Capacity fading is hardly observed in
all the HP(XXX, 1000 °C) samples, although the respective Qcha (or Qdis) values
are different.

Figure S10 shows the
rate performance
of the HP(x = 0.1, 1000 °C) sample. Qdis of ∼40 mA h·g–1 is obtained at the current of 1.0 mA, although the Qdis values decrease with increasing the applied current.
The current of 1.0 mA corresponds to 200 mA·g–1 based on the weight of the active material.

Discussion
The value of Qrecha observed for the
HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample was limited to ∼40
mA h·g–1, which was significantly lower than Qtheo based on the reaction in eq 2 (=308 mA h·g–1). This was attributed to the presence of a small amount of the Li2MnO3 phase in the sample; however, its quantitative
influence was unclear. Thus, an Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was performed
to clarify the effects of Mn ions on the 1D conduction pathway. Because
CF-LMO exhibits the 1D conduction pathway along the bo-axis, the presence of Mn ions would obstruct the diffusion
of Li+ ions. The illustration at the top of Figure 7a shows that the Li+ ions surrounded by Mn ions are immobile, and that only the Li+ ions at either end of the channel are mobile. We employed
two variables of p and q for the
MC simulation, where p (%) is the ratio of Mn ions
in a certain channel and q (nm) is the length of
this channel obtained by 10n × bo. Thus, when p = 0, 100% of
relative capacity should be obtained. Figure 7a shows the results of the MC simulation,
with p ranging from 0 to 90% and for q between 101bo and 105bo. As p increases,
the value of Qrela exponentially decreases
except for q = 101bo. The SEM observations indicated that the average size of
the primary particles of the HP(1000 °C) sample is ∼2
μm [Figure 2d].
Moreover, the Rietveld analysis clarified that the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample contained 9.1% of the Li2MnO3 phase in coexistence with CF-LMO, as shown in [Figure 3f and Table 2]. Applying p = 10% and q = 102bo, the value
of Qrela is calculated to be 17.3%, which
is comparable with the ratio of the actual Qrecha to Qtheo (=13.0%).

Figure 7 (a)Results
of the MC simulation to clarify the effects on Mn ions
in the 1D conduction pathway. (b)Charge and discharge curves of the
SP-LMO(x = 0.333)/Li cells, where SP-LMO(x = 0.333) possesses a 3D conduction pathway for Li+ ions. SP-LMO(x = 0.333) contains 12.1 wt
% of Li2MnO3 as an impurity.

Finally, we investigated the electrochemical properties
of a spinel
compound with a 3D conduction pathway for Li+ ions. Figure 7b shows the charge
and discharge curves of the SP-LMO(x = 0.333)/Li
cell operated in the voltage range between 3.0 and 5.0 V. As shown
in Figure S1d, the Li2MnO3 phase is present as an impurity (12.1 wt %) in the SP-LMO(x = 0.333) sample. Thus, the nominal composition of the
SP-LMO(x = 0.333) sample is represented as Li[Li0.21Mn1.79]O4, and its Qtheo at 3.0–5.0 V was calculated to be 56 mA h·g–1.5 The value of Qrecha of the SP-LMO(x = 0.333)
sample was determined to be 45 mA h·g–1, thereby
indicating that approximately 80% of the value of Qrecha could be attributed to the 3D conduction pathway
in the spinel structure. This means that electrochemical properties
of compounds with 3D conduction pathway are not influenced by the
presence of immobile ions such as Mn ions.

Conclusion
We
examined the crystal structures and electrochemical properties
of the CF-LMO samples that were synthesized from SP-LMO. Rietveld
analyses clarified that the transformation from SP-LMO (Fd3̅m) to CF-LMO (Pnma) does
not proceed directly. Instead, it is a multistep process involving
the formation of three intermediate phases; that is, Li2MnO3 with C2/m, MnO2 with P42/mnm, and Mn2O3 with Pbca. Subsequent
to HT treatment, the Li2MnO3 phase (with a weight
ratio of 9.1 wt %) continued to exist in the HP(1000 °C) sample.
The presence of this small amount of Li2MnO3 significantly affected the electrochemical performance of the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample. That is, in the voltage range
between 1.5 and 5.3 V, the value of Qrecha was limited to ∼40 mA h·g–1, although
this value was expected to exceed that of Qtheo, that is, 300 mA h·g–1, for the electrochemical
reaction involving two-electron transfer. The MC simulation quantitatively
explained the small value of Qrecha of
the HP(x = 0, 1000 °C) sample; that is, the Qrela exponentially decreases as a consequence
of the increase in the number of Mn ions in the Li+-ion
conduction pathway. The presence of Mn ions did not similarly degrade
the electrochemical properties of the material with the 3D conduction
pathway, indicating that elimination of the Li2MnO3 phase is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties
of CF-LMO.

Experimental Section
Sample Preparation
The SP-LMO samples
were prepared
by a two-step solid-state reaction technique to obtain well-developed
{111} crystal facets.5 Reagent grade LiOH·H2O and MnO2 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.),
both in powder form, were mixed with a mortar and pestle and then
pressed into a pellet with a diameter and thickness of 23 and ∼5
mm, respectively. The pellets were heated at 1000 °C under flowing
oxygen and were annealed at 700 °C for 24 h, 600 °C for
24 h, and 500 °C for 48 h, without cooling them down to RT between
successive steps. The obtained SP-LMO samples were characterized by
XRD measurements using Fe Kα radiation (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker AXS,
Inc.), SEM (S-3600N, Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Ltd.), and electrochemical
charge and discharge tests in a nonaqueous lithium cell. Single-phase
Li2MnO3 was also synthesized by a solid-state
reaction technique, namely, by heating stoichiometric amounts of LiOH·H2O and MnO2 powder at 900 °C for 12 h in air.

The CF-LMO samples were synthesized using a Walker-type HP equipment
at Osaka Prefecture University. Approximately 60 mg of the SP-LMO(x = 0), SP-LMO(x = 0.1), SP-LMO(x = 0.2), or SP-LMO(x = 0.333) samples,
respectively, was packed into a Pt capsule, which was installed into
a (Mg,Co)O pressure medium with an octahedral shape (Mino Ceramics
Co., Ltd.) with a side length of 14 mm. The (Mg,Co)O octahedron was
set in the corner consisting of WC anvils with eight truncations (Fuji
Die Co., Ltd.), and compressed up to 6, 8, or 12 GPa at RT. After
reaching the desired pressure, the (Mg,Co)O octahedron was heated
at 200, 400, 600, 800, or 1000 °C for 30 h. Details of these
HP syntheses were described elsewhere.19,21,31,32

XRD, SEM, and Magnetic
Analyses
The HP/HT synthesized
samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, and magnetic analyses. The
sources of X-rays for the XRD measurements were both conventional
Fe Kα and synchrotron radiation. The synchrotron XRD measurements
were performed at the BL5S2 beamline in the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation
Center using a two-dimensional detector, PILATUS 100K (Dectris Ltd.).
The samples were packed into borosilicate glass capillaries with a
diameter of 0.3 mm (W. Müller Glas Technik). The wavelength
of the X-rays was determined to be 0.799436(2) Å using standard
silicon powder (NIST 640d). Rietveld analyses were conducted with
the software RIETAN-FP.20 The schematics
of the crystal structures were drawn by the software VESTA.33 χ of the HP(x = 0, 1000
°C) sample was measured in a field-cooling mode under a magnetic
field of 10 kOe (MPMS, Quantum Design).

Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical reactivities
were examined in the lithium cell by using a nonaqueous electrolyte
comprising 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC)
and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solution (EC/DMC = 3/7 by volume, Kishida
Chemical Co. Ltd.). The working electrodes were prepared by mixing
75 wt % SP-LMO or HP(XXX, YYY °C) samples, 20 wt % acetylene
black (Denka Company Ltd.), and 5 wt % PTFE (Du Pont-Mitsui Fluorochemicals
Co., Ltd.). The current collector consisted of aluminum or copper
mesh with a diameter and thickness of 16 mm ϕ and ∼1
mm, respectively. Two sheets of the porous polyethylene membrane (TonenGeneral
Sekiyu K. K.) were used as a separator. The lithium cells were operated
at a current of 0.05 mA (≃0.05 mA·cm–2) at 25 °C. The voltage range was 1.5–5.3 V for evaluation
as the positive electrode and 0.02–3.0 V for evaluation as
the negative electrode. We employed these voltage ranges to clarify
the whole electrochemical properties of the samples. The discharge
cutoff voltage of 1.5 V was also employed for lithium-excess manganese
oxides.34 Details of the preparation of
the electrodes and the conditions under which the electrochemical
measurements were carried out are described elsewhere5,21,32

MC Method
The
effect of Mn ions on Li-ion movement
via the 1D conduction pathway was evaluated by the MC method. First, p amount (%) of Mn ions was randomly placed in the 1D conduction
pathway with a length of q nm. Assuming that Li+ ions surrounded by Mn ions are immobile, the relative capacity
(Qrela) was calculated iteratively with
respect to each p value. The calculations were repeated
10 000 times to determine the average value of Qrela and its standard deviation. Details of the calculation
are provided in a schematic illustration.
