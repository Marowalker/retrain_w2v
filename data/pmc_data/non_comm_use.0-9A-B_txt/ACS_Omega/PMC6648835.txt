Two new triptycene-based azobenzene-functionalized
polymers (TBAFPs) have been synthesized using the well-known
Pd-catalyzed
Sonogashira cross-coupling polycondensation reaction between 2,6-diethynyltriptycene
and (meta or para) dibromo-azobenzenes.
Enhancement of the fluorescent emission intensity was observed upon
trans → cis isomerization of −N=N― linkage
in TBAFPs. The cis-lifetime of TBAFP1 is
rather long (greater than 2 days). The resulting materials were tested
as a potential chemosensor for the detection of picric acid (PA)—a
water pollutant as well as chemical constituent of explosives used
in warfare. PA was found to interact strongly with TBAFPs, which led to significant quenching of the latter’s fluorescence
emission intensities. The binding constants are in the order of 105 M–1. TBAFPs were also able
to detect PA in nanomolar concentrations.

Introduction
In recent decades,
research related to polymers derived from monomers
with azobenzene functional groups have attracted considerable attention.1−10 Azobenzene can exist in either trans or cis form with regard to
the −N=N― linkage with the former being thermodynamically
more stable than the latter. The azobenzene unit undergoes photoisomerization
because this chromophore is photoresponsive. Therefore, one of the
most exciting properties of azobenzene-functionalized polymers is
their photoresponsive nature, which is due to photoinduced isomerization
of azo units. The potential applications of azo-polymers are, thus,
mainly due to their unique ability to photoisomerize, photo-orient,
and show refractive effect changes induced by light.2,11 These materials are, therefore, recognized as promising candidates
for applications such as optical data storage,12,13 rewritable holograms,14 reversible photomechanical
systems,15 holographic media for high-capacity
data storage,16 as adsorbents with tunable
pore size for CO2 capture,17 and light-triggered drug release.18 Photochromic
properties of azobenzene were also applied in the design of molecular
machines,19 nanodimensional vehicles,20 molecular scissors,21 molecular pedals,22 molecular sunflower,23 molecular lift,24 and host–guest recognition.25 Azo-polymers
may have the azobenzene chromophore incorporated either in the side
chains26 or in the polymer main chain.27

Triptycene is the smallest member of a
class of aromatic compounds
known as “iptycene” in which three or more arene rings
are integrated via a bicyclo[2.2.2]octatriene bridgehead unit.28 Iptycene-based monomers are “exceptionally
stable” and are reported to yield “high-performance
polymers”.29 Potential applications
of iptycene-based polymeric materials include but are not limited
to fluorescent sensors (for detection of trace quantities of explosives),30 thermally stable interlayer dielectric materials
(for use in integrated circuits),31 low
dielectric constant materials (for use as insulators),32 and as structural materials (with improved mechanical
properties).29,33 More recently, triptycene-based
porous network polymers are being projected as materials for selective
capture and storage of small gas molecules such as H2 and
CO2.34,35 The rigid three-dimensional framework
of iptycene motifs generate internal free volume in such polymers
resulting in the aforementioned favorable properties.29

Picric acid (PA) belongs to the family of nitroaromatic
compounds
(NACs).36 Nitrated aromatic molecules such
as TNT, DNT, and others are chemical components of certain explosives.37 PA was also used extensively for this purpose
in the last century.38 PA is also a useful
industrial chemical employed in pharmaceutical and dye industries.39 PA is highly soluble in water, and its extensive
use may lead to contamination of ground water and soil. This is a
matter of environmental concern because PA toxicity may cause human
health-related issues such as eye/skin irritation, anemia, lung damage,
and even cancer.40 Therefore, development
of probes to detect PA at very low concentrations is an active area
of research. Till date, various highly sensitive probes have been
designed to sense PA in low concentrations and these are based on
small molecules,41 nanomaterial,42 gels,43 polymeric
networks, and even metal organic frameworks.44 Most sensors detect PA using fluorescence spectroscopy.45,46 PA has an electron-deficient aromatic ring (due to the presence
of electron-withdrawing nitro groups) that interacts with electron-rich
fluorescent sensors rendering them nonfluorescent. This method of
PA detection is most convenient because it is economical and a rapid
testing technique.43,47

Herein, we report for the
first time, two triptycene-based linear
polymers bearing azobenzene chromophores as integral units of the
main chain. We have christened these polymers triptycene-based azobenzene-functionalized
polymers (TBAFPs). These polymers are soluble in organic
solvents and are fluorescent in nature. To the best of our knowledge,
photoresponsive properties of triptycene-based azo-polymers have not
been explored till date. Therefore, we have studied their photophysical
properties in solution. Additionally, application of these polymers
in sensing PA has been studied. It has been observed that using TBAFPs, trace quantities of PA can be detected with high sensitivity.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of Monomers
2,6-Diethynyltriptycene
(DET) monomer (1) was prepared using a previously reported
synthetic protocol using the Sonogashira coupling reaction between
2,6-dibromotriptycene and trimethylsilylacetylene.48

(E)-1,2-Bis(4-bromophenyl)diazene
(2) was prepared by reacting 4-bromoaniline with KMnO4 and FeSO4 in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent (Scheme 1).49 Using the similar reaction conditions, (E)-1,2-bis(3-bromophenyl)diazene (3) was obtained in
high yield (90%). Both molecules (2 and 3) were obtained as orange-colored solids, and these were characterized
using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopies that
confirmed their purity. The presence of azo-linkage (−N=N−)
was confirmed by the presence of a band centered at 1472 cm–1 in the respective FTIR spectrum (Supporting Information, Figure S1). All signals in the 1H and 13C{1H}NMR spectra of 2 and 3 were correctly assigned (Supporting Information, Figures S2 and S3). In the 13C NMR spectra of 2 and 3, the peaks at 151 and 153 ppm were assigned
to the carbon nuclei attached to the azo (−N=N−)
functional group (Figures S4 and S5).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Monomers
Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Polymers
Pd/Cu-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction is one of the
most convenient and widely used method to yield C–C bonds between
aryl halides and terminal acetylenes.50 2,6-DET (1) and dibromo azobenzene monomers (2 or 3) were reacted in the presence of catalytic
amount of Pd(PPh3)4 to yield the desired polymers
(TBAFP1 and TBAFP2) in high yields (>90%)
(Scheme 2). In these
reactions carried out at 70 °C, dimethylformamide was used as
the solvent, triethylamine (TEA) as the base, and cuprous iodide as
the cocatalyst. TBAFPs are macromolecules that have triptycene
and azobenzene units linked via ethynyl bridges. Although TBAFP1 is orange in color, TBAFP2 was obtained as a reddish
brown solid. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of TBAFPs were obtained from their respective
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis (Table 1 and Figures S6 and S7) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (polystyrene was used as the standard).
In case of TBAFP1, the dispersity (D̵M = 2.44) corresponds to 16 repeating units (Pn = 16). On the other hand, for TBAFP2 having
relatively lower Mn, the dispersity (D̵M = 2.55) corresponds to nine repeating
units (Pn = 9). TBAFPs were
found to be easily soluble in halogenated (CDCl3 and CH2Cl2) as well as nonhalogenated (tetrahydrofuran
and toluene) solvents (solubility chart of TBAFPsTable S1). The excellent solubility exhibited
by these polymers was attributed to the presence of the bulky and
rigid triptycene units that inhibits efficient packing of polymer
chains.29

°C at a scan rate 10 °C/min(N2 gas flow rate

d Char weight
calculated at 800 °C.

The structure of polymers TBAFP1 and TBAFP2 were confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In the
FT-IR spectra of TBAFPs (Figure 1), the characteristic peak due to the azo
(−N=N−) linkage was observed at 1468 cm–1. The presence of −C≡C– linkages in the polymer
backbone was confirmed from the presence of the weak band appearing
at 2210 cm–1. Additionally, absence of ≡C–H
stretching band also confirmed the successful Sonogashira polycondensation
reaction between DET and dibromoazobenzenes (2 and 3) leading to the formation of new C(sp2)–C(sp)
bonds.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of TBAFP2 (top), TBAFP1 (middle),
and DET (bottom).

Furthermore, the structures
of the polymers (TBAFP1 and TBAFP2) were
also confirmed by 1H NMR
spectroscopy. In the NMR spectra of TBAFPs (Figure 2) recorded in CDCl3 as the solvent, the signal at around δ = 5.50 ppm corresponds
to the characteristic bridgehead protons of the triptycene unit. In TBAFP1, the protons in the phenyl ring that are in ortho position
with respect to the azo (−N=N−) group appear
at 7.92 ppm. The remaining hydrogen nuclei bonded to the aromatic
ring of triptycene and azobenzene unit are shifted upfield and appear
in the range 7.60–7.00 ppm. Similarly, all signals appearing
in the spectrum of TBAFP2 were assigned precisely (Figure 2). A broad feature
in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern (Figure 3) indicated the amorphous nature of TBAFPs. Incorporation of rigid and bulky triptycene units
in the main polymeric chain prevents their efficient interchain interactions
and packing, which results in the observed amorphous nature of TBAFPs.

Morphological Analysis of TBAFPs
Figure 4 shows field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs of the TBAFPs. These polymers appear as nail-shaped nanorods with one broad end
that gradually tapers to a relatively much narrower end. The diameter
of the “nail-head” is in the range between 100 and 200
nm. The length of these nanonails varied between 400 and 500 nm. It
can be observed that the broad ends of the “nanorods”
exhibit flat cross-sections. There was no marked difference in the
morphologies of TBAFP1 and TBAFP2.

Figure 4 FESEM images
of TBAFPs.

Thermal Property of TBAFPs
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of these polymers was performed to gauge their thermal
stability (Figure 5). The thermal degradation temperature (Td at 10% weight loss) for the polymer, TBAFP1 (470 °C)
is higher than that for TBAFP2 (214 °C), and this
may be due to the relatively higher molecular weight in case of the
former. The char yields of both polymers are slightly greater than
64% at 800 °C (Table 1). The presence of rigid and robust triptycene motifs in the
polymer chains result in the high thermal stabilities observed for TBAFPs reported herein.29 Differential
scanning calorimetery (DSC) traces were recorded for TBAFPs (Supporting Information, Figures S8 and
S9). The polymers are amorphous in nature as evident from PXRD pattern
therefore, no such characteristic phase transitions were observed.

of polymers (TBAFP1 and TBAFP2).

Optical Properties of Polymers (TBAFP1 and TBAFP2)
Ultraviolet (UV)–visible
absorption
spectra were recorded by dissolving TBAFPs in THF (concentration
= 10–7 M). UV–visible absorption spectra
of TBAFP1 and TBAFP2 show absorbance maximum,
λmax at 391 and 316 nm, respectively (Figure 6), which are attributed to
π–π* transitions in these polymers. Comparison
of the spectra (Figure 6) clearly suggests that TBAFP1 has better extended conjugation
along the main chain than TBAFP2.

Figure 6 Normalized UV–visible
absorbance spectra of polymers TBAFP1 and TBAFP2 in THF.

Photoinduced Isomerization
of Polymers
Polymers reported
herein were dissolved in THF solvent and subjected to UV irradiation.
The photoisomerization of TBAFPs (Scheme 3) was monitored by observing the change in
intensity of the band in their respective UV–vis spectrum that
corresponds π–π* electronic transition. It is well
known that azobenzene derivatives may exist as trans and cis isomers
(with respect to the azo double bond). In the more stable state, the
azo linkages are in the trans orientation for which π–π*
electronic transition has a lower energy relative to that for the
cis form (less stable). In case of TBAFP1, the band observed
at 391 nm is due to π–π* transition in azobenzene
chromophore in the more stable trans form (Figure 7a). Upon irradiating the TBAFP1 solution with UV radiation (300 nm), the intensity of the π–π*
absorption band at 391 nm was observed to decrease gradually with
the increased irradiation time (Figure 7a). After 20 min of UV irradiation, the π–π*
absorbance band shifted to a shorter wavelength and was then observed
at 320 nm (Figure 7a). We attribute this spectral change to trans → cis isomerization
of the azo linkages in the polymer (TBAFP1) main chain
upon exposure to UV radiation. The blue shift of λmax corresponds to considerable decrease in the extent of conjugation
in the cis-form.

Figure 7 Spectral changes in the absorption spectra of (a) TBAFP1 and (b) TBAFP2 in dilute THF solution
upon UV irradiation
of 300 nm (concentration = 10–7 M in THF).

Scheme 3 Photoisomerization of TBAFP1 under UV Irradiation
In case of TBAFP2, the strong absorption
band centered
at 316 nm corresponds to the π–π* transitions of trans-azobenzene units in the polymer main chain (Figure 7b). The intensity
of this band also decreased when a THF solution of TBAFP2 was irradiated with UV light (300 nm) leading to photoinduced trans
to cis isomerization (Figure 7b). The band appears at relatively shorter wavelength in the
cis-form (than that due to trans-azobenzene units)
because of further decrease in degree of conjugation in the main chain.
The rate constants of photoinduced isomerization of TBAFPs were estimated from the first order kinetics expression ln[(A0 – A∞)/(A0 – At)] = kexpt where A0, At, and A∞ are the absorbance
at t = 0 (before irradiation), t, and t = ∞, respectively, and kexp is the rate constant.51 First-order rate constant for trans–cis photoisomerization
of polymer TBAFP1 and TBAFP2 were observed
to be 5.53 × 10–4 s–1 and
13.5 × 10–4 s–1, respectively
(Figure S10, Supporting Information).

Photoinduced Fluorescence Enhancement with Trans–Cis
Isomerization
Before exposure to UV radiation, dilute solution
of TBAFPs (THF as solvent and concentration = 10–7 M) shows very weak fluorescence upon excitation at
320 nm (Figure 8, at t = 0 min). This is also indicated from the very low quantum
yields (trans-TBAFP1: λem = 403 nm and Φ = 0.0087, TBAFP2: λem = 425 nm and Φ = 0.0048). The fluorescence emission
spectra for these polymers were again recorded after irradiating solutions
of TBAFPs with UV radiation. A noticeable increase in
the fluorescence intensity was observed with UV irradiation [Figure 8a,b]. Fluorescence
enhancement upon photoisomerization (from trans → cis) has
been previously reported by others.52−56 These instances of fluorescence enhancement may be
due to nonplanar/twisted geometry in the cis isomer in which photoinduced
electron transfer is inhibited due to reduced extent of conjugation
of the nitrogen lone pair of electrons and the π electrons of
the fluorophore.51 Moreover, enhanced fluorescence
emission in macromolecules containing an azobenzene unit has also
been attributed to aggregation such as self-assembled bilayer aggregates.54,56−59 In case of TBAFP1, a 20 min UV irradiation resulted
in the fluorescence intensity increase by 20 times relative to that
before its exposure to UV light [Figure 8a]. An appreciable increase (seven times)
in the quantum yield of TBAFP1 was observed after its
exposure to UV radiation (λex = 320 nm, λem = 386 nm and Φ = 0.06). This implies that upon isomerization
of azobenzene units from the trans to the cis form, there is an enhancement
of fluorescence for this material. Change in the quantum yield value
of TBAFPs upon photoisomerization has been shown in Figure S11. Similarly, in case of TBAFP2, the quantum yield improved to 0.0478 (λem = 425
nm), which is around 16 folds relative to the very weakly fluorescent TBAFP2 in its trans form [Figure 8b]. Weakly fluorescent TBAFP1  and TBAFP2 in the trans form have average radiative
lifetime ⟨τ⟩ of 1.12 and 1.21 ns, respectively
(Figure 8c). TBAFPs emitted enhanced fluorescence after photoisomerization.
The lifetime decay plots of these fluorescent TBAFPs after
20 minutes of UV irradiation are shown in Figure 8d. The average radiative lifetime ⟨τ⟩
was observed to be 2.94 and 2.42 ns for TBAFP1 and TBAFP2, respectively. The fluorescence quantum yield measurements
were performed using quinine sulfate as the reference in 1 N H2SO4 solution (Φ = 0.546).

Thermal Cis-to-Trans Isomerization
The thermal cis–trans
isomerization of azobenzene units is reported to be fast.60,61 However, the rate of thermal back-isomerization from cis-form to
trans-form is also dependent on the nature and conformation of the
compound.62,63 The energy barrier for this thermal cis–trans
isomerization is around 90 kJ/mol.11,61 Therefore,
the thermodynamically unstable cis form relaxes back to stable trans
form even at room temperature, rendering a relatively smaller cis-lifetime
of few hours in case of azobenzene. On the other hand, for practical
applications such as data storage and photochromic memory, a “two
stable state system” is desired.61,64 Attempts have
been reported in the past to increase the cis-isomer’s lifetime.
For example, the inclusion of azobenzene motifs in the main chain
of a polyurethane enhances the cis-life by up to 4 days.65 Bulky substituents were incorporated to prevent
the thermal back isomerization of azo motifs, which increased the
half-life by more than 5 days.66 Conformational
ring strain in azobenzene contained macrocycles was responsible for
higher cis lifetime up to 19.7 days.62 Similarly,
cyclic peptides bearing azobenzene units have been reported to have
a cis lifetime of nearly 40 days.67 These
representative examples reiterate that the cis–trans isomerization
of azo linkages present in the polymeric main chain is usually associated
with large degree of geometric changes in the overall molecular configuration.
In case of TBAFPs reported herein, the presence of bulky
and rigid triptycene motif in these polymers are anticipated to improve
the cis-lifetime of the azo linkages. Interestingly, very slow thermally
driven cis–trans isomerization was observed even after keeping
samples (previously treated with UV light) in dark for 2 days (Figure 9a). In case of TBAFP1, an improvement in quantum yield (Φ = 0.08) (Figure 9b) was observed after
incubation of the cis isomer in dark for 2 days at 25 °C. The
quantum yield was relatively less (Φ = 0.06) before thermal
cis-to-trans isomerization.

spectra of
UV-irradiated TBAFP1 (THF solution) after 2 days of dark
incubation.

Interaction of TBAFPs with PA
TBAFPs are fluorescent in the cis
form after photoisomerization. Additionally, TBAFPs have
electron-rich arene rings of triptycene as well
as nitrogen-rich azo (−N=N−) linkages in the
polymer framework. In this context, PA (a NAC) is relatively electron
deficient due to the presence of three electron-withdrawing nitro
groups in the arene ring. Therefore, it was expected that the relatively
electron-rich polymer framework of TBAFPs would have
facile interactions (hydrogen bonding/π–π/dipole–dipole
interactions) with PA.43,47,68−71 With these premises in mind, we were curious to study the host–guest
interaction between these polymers (TBAFPs) and PA. The
fluorescence emission of TBAFPs was quenched in the presence
of PA with an excellent binding affinity. TBAFPs were
dissolved in THF and solution concentration was 2 × 10–7 M in THF. For host–guest interaction between TBAFPs and PA, absorbance titration experiments were performed between
cis-form of TBAFPs upon incremental addition of PA [Supporting Information, Figure S12]. In case
of the fluorescence titration experiment, a steady decrease in the
fluorescence intensity (fluorescence quenching) of TBAFPs was observed (Figure 10) with the gradual addition of PA (concentration ranging from
10–7 to 4 × 10–6 M). This
behavior may be attributed to the efficient interaction of electron-rich TBAFPs with electron-poor PA. In order to estimate the extent
of complexation, the corresponding binding constants were calculated
using the modified Benesi–Hildebrand (B–H) equation
for the formation of 1:1 complex (eq 1). 1  

Figure 10 Fluorescence quenching of (left) TBAFP1 (2 ×
10–7 mol L–1) and (right) TBAFP2 (2 × 10–7 mol L–1) in the presence of PA as quencher in THF.

In the above eq 1,
“F0” is fluorescence intensity
of the TBAFPs in the absence of a quencher. The fluorescence
intensity of TBAFPs in the presence of a quencher is
“F”. The concentration of the quencher
(PA) is represented by [Q]. The constant A is associated
with the emission quantum yield of the complexed and uncomplexed polymer. K is the binding constant of TBAFPs with PA.

Fluorescence quenching data revealed an excellent fit for 1:1 complexation
between polymer TBAFPs and PA (Figure 11). The corresponding binding constant (K) for 1:1 complexation between polymers and PA were calculated
to be 3.39 × 105 and 1.18 × 105 for
polymers, TBAFP1 and TBAFP2, respectively.
Interestingly, TBAFP1 shows considerably higher fluorescence
quenching (78%) relative to TBAFP2 (57%), which clearly
suggests its higher affinity toward PA. This inference was also supported
by the higher magnitude of binding constant value calculated for TBAFP1.

Figure 11 B–H fluorescence plot of 1:1 complexation between
(left)
PA and polymer TBAFP1 and (right) PA and polymer TBAFP2 recorded in THF.

Additionally, the quenching effect of TBAFPs by PA
(as quencher) was studied by using the well-known Stern–Volmer
equation: F0/F = 1 + Ksv·[Q], where F0 is the initial fluorescence intensity of TBAFPs in
the absence of PA and F is the corresponding fluorescence
intensity after adding PA having a concentration of [Q], and Ksv is the quenching coefficient of TBAFPs for PA.

Using a plot of F0/F (relative fluorescence intensity) versus [Q], Stern–Volmer
quenching constant (Ksv) was estimated
from the slope of the linear plot (Figure 12). In case of titration of TBAFP1 and TBAFP2 with PA, Ksv was measured to be 537 000 and 243 000, respectively
(Figure 12 and Table 2), indicating that TBAFPs interact efficiently with PA.

plots for the quenching of fluorescence of

TBAPF2	1.18 × 105	2.4 × 105	151	
The PA “detection
limit” of TBAFPs was
also obtained from the fluorescence quenching plots (Figure 12). The limit of detection
(LOD) was calculated using the following equation 2  where “SD” is standard deviation
and “B” is the slope of the curve equations.42

The detection limits for PA were observed
to be 144 and 151 nM
for TBAFP1 and TBAFP2, respectively. These
data suggest that fluorescent TBAFPs may be used for
detecting PA present in ultra-trace quantities.

Conclusions
In summary, we report herein, two new triptycene-based polymers
(TBAFPs) containing photoisomerizable azobenzene groups
in polymer main chain. The synthesis utilized Sonogashira cross-coupling
reaction of DET with two different monomers bearing azobenzene functional
groups. The UV–vis absorption spectra suggested that TBAFP1 has higher extended conjugation compared to TBAFP2. SEM images of TBAFPs indicate that these have well-defined
morphology resembling that of nanodimensional nails. The photoinduced
isomerization of azo groups (solution of TBAFPs in THF)
resulted in noticeable fluorescence emission enhancement. Upon UV
irradiation, the material obtained with azobenzene units in cis-orientation
had considerably higher life-time (up to 2 days) suggesting that the
cis- to trans-thermal isomerization was rather slow. The photo-switchable
and fluorescence-emitting properties of TBAFPs under
UV irradiation makes them promising candidates for various potential
applications. Additionally, the fluorescent material obtained after
UV-light irradiation was found to interact efficiently with PA. LOD
estimation projects TBAFPs as potential chemosensor materials
for detection of PA in nanomolar concentration. Thus, new polymers
reported herein enrich the library of materials that exhibit strong
interaction with PA and TBAFPs may have useful applications
in the sensing of nitroaromatics.

General Synthesis of TBAFPs
Dibromoazobenzene
monomer (2 or 3) (68 mg, 0.2 mmol), monomer 1 (DET) (60 mg, 0.2 mmol), CuI (2 mg, 0.02 mmol)), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)
palladium(0) (12 mg, 0.01 mmol) were taken in a 25 mL Schlenk flask
in the glove box. Subsequently, 8 mL (1:4) mixture of freshly distilled
TEA and dry DMF was added under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction
mixture thus obtained was stirred at 70 °C for 72 h. The resulting
reaction mixture after cooling to room temperature was poured into
methanol and vigorously stirred to yield a brown-orange precipitate,
which was filtered through a glass frit (G-4) and washed several
times with methanol. The solid residue on the glass frit was redissolved
in a small amount of DCM to obtain a clear reddish-yellow filtrate.
The resulting solution was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and
reprecipitated in methanol. This precipitate was again filtered on
the glass frit and subsequently dried overnight under vacuum to afford
an orange-colored solid as the target polymer.

4H), 7.34–7.17 (m, 2H), 7.145–6.96 (m, 2H), and 5.52–5.42
(m, 2H). FT-IR (KBr): 3054, 2957, 2918, 2858, 2210, 1699, 1512, 1468,
1412, 1188, 1160, 1102, 1009, 951, 894, 851, 742, and 656 cm–1.

TBAFP2
Yield: 81 mg, 90%; Mn = 4.2k Da, D̵M = 2.55. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.14–7.98 (m, 2H),
7.94–7.82 (m, broad, 6H), 7.68–7.48 (m, 4H), 7.47–7.31

Polymer Characterization
(1H NMR, FTIR,
TGA, and DSC). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
400 MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 solution of TBAFPs containing tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. IR
spectra of the TBAFPs were recorded using Shimadzu IR
Affinity-1 spectrometer. TGA data were obtained using SDT Q600 (TA
Instruments) at a scan rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen flow
(100 mL/min). Thermal properties of TBAFPs were also
tested by using DSC (TG-DSC, STA 449 F3 Jupiter NETZSCH, Selb, Germany)
with a heating or cooling rate of 10 °C/min–1.

GPC Analysis
Agilent PL-GPC 50 integrated GPC spectrometer
was used to determine molecular weights and polydispersities of TBAFPs using THF as the eluent. Polymer solutions (sample
concentration 1 mg/mL) were prepared in THF. The molecular weights
of the polymers were determined using a standard calibration curve
based on polystyrene standards and flow rate used was 1.0 mL/min at
25 °C.

Photophysical Investigations (UV–Vis
Absorption, Life
Time Decay Plots, and Fluorescence Spectroscopies)
UV–vis
spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV- 2550 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Fluorescence spectra were recorded using the Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4
spectrofluorometer. UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectra
of polymer solutions (10–7 M polymer concentration
in toluene) were measured using a 1 cm quartz cell. Lifetime decay
plots of TBAFPs were recorded on a HORIBA Scientific
Deltaflex (Modular Fluorescence Lifetime System).

Microscopic
Analysis (FE-SEM Investigation)
For sample
preparation, the following protocol was adapted. A suitably sized
silicon wafer was cleaned using acetone (HPLC grade) and then rinsed
with water (double distilled). The polymer solution (concentration
10–5 M in toluene) was dropcasted on the precleaned
silicon wafer. The films thus obtained because of solvent evaporation
were allowed to dry at room temperature for 1 h to remove any residual
solvent. FE-SEM images of the dropcasted films (of TBAFPs) were captured using a Carl Zeiss ultra plus field emission scanning
electron microscope. For high resolution imaging, a very thin layer
of gold was deposited on the surface of the polymer sample using a
Quorum Q150RS vacuum sputter to increase the electrical conductivity.
