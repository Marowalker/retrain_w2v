A palladium-catalyzed
synthesis of arylglyoxylic amides by the
reaction of arylglyoxylates and N,N-dialkylamides in the presence of a 2,3-dihalopyridine has been realized
for the first time. An anticipated 2,3-diaroylpyridine did not form
in this reaction. The current study unveils an unprecedented role
of 2,3-dihalopyridine toward this amidation. Our mechanistic study
reveals that the arylglyoxylate could react with halopyridine to form
a traceless activated pyridyl ester of arylglyoxylic acid, which upon
subsequent reaction with amino surrogate, N,N-dialkylamides could form the arylglyoxylic amides.

Introduction
In the tabulated list
of important functional groups available
in any standard organic chemistry tutorial, the amide group would
occupy a prominent position, not only as the backbone of proteins
but also as an ubiquitous component of unnatural materials.1 Historically, amides have been prepared from
carboxylic acids and amines, especially via activation of carboxylic
acids in the presence of a coupling agent.2 An α-functionalized carboxylic acid may exert dissimilar reactivity
toward amidation, which often could remain unnoticed (Scheme 1).3 Amide formation from arylglyoxylic acids containing an electron-withdrawing
α-carbonyl functionality has been in line with the victory.
The arylglyoxylic amides represent a key structural unit of many natural
compounds and pharmaceuticals displaying a broad spectrum of biological
activities.4 Among the various methods
to prepare them,2 the most privileged method
involves condensation of arylglyoxylic acids and amines using commonly
used coupling agents.5 However, amide formation
directly from arylglyoxylic acid and amines often causes impediment,6 as amines could undergo condensation with arylglyoxylic
acids to form α-imino carboxylic acids. The synthesis of arylglyoxylic
amides have also been reported using Cu(II)-catalyzed7,8 and tetrabutylammonium iodide-catalyzed reactions.9 Therefore, the advent of a new coupling agent that could
facilitate arylglyoxylic amide preparation could be an incremental
advance in amide chemistry.

Scheme 1 Arylglyoxylic Amides
Previously, we demonstrated decarboxylative
C- or N-acylation of
arylglyoxylic acids under transition-metal-catalyzed or -free conditions.10 During on-going investigation, we recently found
that arylglyoxylic amides could be prepared from arylglyoxylic acids
and N,N-dialkylamides in the presence
of 2,3-dihalopyridines under palladium-catalyzed conditions. The crucial
role of 2,3-dihalopyridines is proposed to be associated with the
formation of vulnerable activated pyridyl ester of arylglyoxylic acid.
The use of weak nucleophilic N,N-dialkylamides as amine surrogates appears to be essential for the
formation of activated ester under the palladium-catalyzed condition.
A premature mechanistic study reveals that the activated ester upon
reaction with N,N-dialkylamides
could deliver arylglyoxylic amides.

Results and Discussion
Our initial investigation on palladium-catalyzed regioselective
acylation of 2,3-dibromopyridine using arylglyoxylates in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) via decarboxylation
paved the way to the serendipitous synthesis of arylglyoxylic amides.
Thus, heating the mixture of phenylglyoxylate 1a and
2,3-dibromopyridine A1 in the
presence of Pd(OAc)2, P(o-tol)3, and CuI in DMA 2a, used as a solvent, gave arylglyoxylic
amide 3a unexpectedly (Table 1, entry 1). Rather, the formation of 2,3-dibenzoylpyridine
was the expected outcome. Exclusion of CuI gave a similar conversion
to 3a (entry 2). The yield was improved in the presence
of a more electrophilic palladium-catalyst, Pd(TFA)2 (entry
3). Reducing the amount of 2a in combination with the
use of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent had
an adverse effect (entry 4). A catalytic amount of 2,3-dibromopyridine
had a detrimental effect (entries 5–6). Lowering the temperature
was found to be ineffective (entries 7–8). The use of free
acid in the presence of a base was not beneficial (entries 9–10).
However, the use of (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl (TEMPO)
as a radical quencher did not affect the yield of 3a suggesting
a nonradical pathway (entry 11). The product arylglyoxylic amide was
not formed in the absence of palladium (entry 12).

We further explored the scope of
other pyridine substrates that
could help promote the formation of arylglyoxylic amides (Scheme 2). Similar to 2,3-dibromopyridine,
2,3-dichloropyridine A2 also
produced 3a in 64% yield under the reaction condition.
While a mono-bromopyridine (2- or 3-bromopyridine) A3–A4 and its derivative A5 gave 3a in varying yields along with the formation of their corresponding
benzoylpyridines, mono-chloropyridine A6 failed to give 3a. Likewise, pyridine itself
or its derivative lacking any bromo-substituent A7–A13 failed to give 3a. These substrates collectively unravel
the requirement of mono-bromopyridines or 2,3-dihalopyridines as coupling
additives for effective formation of 3a. Interestingly,
1,2-dibromobenzene A14 did not
give 3a under the optimized condition.

Scheme 2 Additive Screening
Next, we explored the substrate
scope of arylglyoxylates that could
participate in the reaction (Scheme 3). The arylglyoxylates containing both electron-rich
and electron-poor substituents reacted with 2a yielding
arylglyoxylic amides 3b–3n in good-to-excellent
yields. The arylglyoxylates containing substituents at the 2-position
afforded 3b–3c in 79–84% yield. An arylglyoxylate
containing an OMe group at the 3-position delivered 3d in 78% yield. Furthermore, the arylglyoxylates bearing electron-donating
groups at the 4-position afforded 3e–3h in 62–81%
yield. However, acids having electron-withdrawing groups at the 4-position
yielded 3i–3j in moderate yields. Interestingly,
halogen groups that are otherwise often incompatible in metal-catalyzed
reactions were tolerated to give 3k–3l in 45–54%
yield. Moreover, when 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid was exposed
to 2a, the product 3m was isolated in excellent
(88%) yield. Heteroarylglyoxylic acids, 2-oxo-2-(thiophen-2-yl)acetic
acid and 2-(furan-2-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid were also viable substrates
giving 3n and 3o, respectively, in 61–66%
yields.

Scheme 3 Substrate Scope of Arylglyoxylic Acids
To demonstrate further the greater synthetic potential
of the protocol,
different acyclic or cyclic acetamides were screened (Scheme 4). It was found that when 1a reacted with lower amount of 2a (4 equiv)
in the presence of mesitylene as solvent also gave 3a in comparable (65%) yield. Other N,N-dialkylacetamide such as N,N-diethylacetamide 2b, N,N-diisopropylacetamide 2c, and N,N-dibenzylacetamide 2d worked well affording 3p–3r in 59–69%
yields. Interestingly, cyclic acetamides were also found to be workable
substrates. N-Acylpiperidines 2e–2f reacted smoothly with 1a to give the desired arylglyoxylic
amide 3s in excellent yields. Likewise, N-acetyl pyrrolidine 2g, morpholine 2h,
and N-methyl piperazine 2i were also
viable substrates yielding 3t–3v in 71–79%
yields. Notably, N,N-dimethyl-2-phenylacetamide 2j also worked under the reaction condition to give product 3a in 78% yield. Similarly, N,N-dimethyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)acetamide 2k underwent reaction
furnishing the product 3a in moderate yield. However, N,N-dimethylbenzamide 2l did
not undergo the reaction under the optimized condition. Central to
this investigation was the ability of various weak N,N-dialkylamides to serve as amino surrogates to
form arylglyoxylic amides.

Scheme 4 Substrate Scope of Tertiary Alkylamides
To understand the possible
pathway to the formation of 3a, the identification of
any putative intermediate that could form
in this reaction and undergo subsequent reaction to form 3a was sought (Scheme 5). As benzoylpyridines were isolated as minor sideproducts when monobromopyrdines
were used as additives (path A), we envisaged that benzoylpyridines
could be the possible intermediates to the formation of 3a (Scheme 5). However,
a control experiment involving the reaction of analytically pure 2-benzoylpyridine 3aa under optimized condition did not afford 3a (eq 1). Furthermore, N,N-dimethyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)acetamide 3ab could be a possible intermediate11 in this reaction, which could be generated in the reaction of N,N-dialkylacetamide and 2-bromopyridine
(path B). However, the attempted reaction of 3ab and 1a under the optimized condition did not give 3a (eq 1). These two experiments precluded the formation arylglyoxylic
amides from any putative intermediate proposed herein. Moreover, control
experiments excluding either 2a or 1a performed
under the optimized condition did not yield any isolable intermediate
(eqs 2 and 3).

Scheme 5 Control Experiments
On the basis of the mechanistic information available
with the
cross-decarboxylative acylation of aryl halides using arylglyoxylic
acids12 and our own observations, we propose
herein the following plausible reaction mechanism (Scheme 6). Initially, an oxidative
addition of palladium(0) could occur at the 2-position of 2,3-dibromopyridine
yielding I. However, palladium insertion at the 3-position
of 2,3-dibromopyridine is not ruled out. Evidence for the formation
of intermediate I warranted trapping the proposed intermediate.
Thus, reaction of 1a and 2a under the standard
condition in the presence of an additional amine, morpholine 2j gave two aminated products of 2,3-dibromopyridine 3ac and 3ad as opposed to 3a (Scheme 7). The regiochemistry
of morpholine substitution in compound 3ac is not known.
It is important to note that only a limited data were obtained for
compounds 3ac and 3ad. However, 3ac and 3ad were not formed in the absence of palladium
and ligand. This rules out the possibility of SNAr reactions in this
case.

Scheme 6 Plausible Reaction Mechanism
Scheme 7 Evidence for the Formation of Intermediate I
This experiment reveals that
a strong nucleophile like morpholine 2j could react with I to form 3ac and 3ad. However,
in the absence of any other nucleophile, 1a could react
with the intermediate I to generate
the intermediate II, which upon decarboxylation following
a conventional pathway could form 2-benzoylpyridine. If decarboxylation
is not facilitated under the condition, inadvertent reductive elimination
of palladium(0) could occur with concomitant formation of the key
pyridyl ester III. Amine nucleophile, which could be
generated in situ from DMA in the presence of phenoxide IV, could react with the activated pyridyl ester III to
deliver 3a. While the proposed activated pyridyl ester
of arylglyoxylic acid is unprecedented, the preparation of aryl carboxamides
from pyridyl ester via activation to pyridinium salts13 could be a reasonable evidence of the proof-of-concept.
However, further study is required to confirm the hypothesis.

In conclusion, a palladium-catalyzed amidation of arylglyoxylic
acids with N,N-dialkylamides in
the presence of halopyridines has been developed. The salient features
of this work may include (a) clear distinction from the previous reports
of arylglyoxylic amide preparation, (b) use of weak nucleophilic N,N-dialkylamides as amino surrogates,
and (c) novel activation of arylglyoxylic acids in the presence of
halopyridines. Various other α-functionalized amides via activated
pyridyl ester, their applications to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals,
and detailed understanding of the mechanism could be a subject of
intensive future research.

Experimental Section
General
Unless
stated otherwise, all reagents and solvents
were obtained from commercial sources and used as it is. All reactions
were carried out in a screw capped tube. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl3 as a solvent
using a 400 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard. Coupling constants (J values) are described
in Hz. Silica gel (60–120#, 100–200#, and 230–400#)
was used to perform column chromatography. High-resolution mass spectra
(HRMS) were obtained by the use of electron spray ionization and time-of-flight
mass analyzer. IR spectra are stated in cm–1 units.

All substituted α-oxocarboxylic
acids were prepared using the literature protocol.14

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Potassium
Salts of the
α-Oxocarboxylic Acids (1a–1n)
Following
a literature procedure,15 a solution of
potassium tert-butoxide (1 mmol) in ethanol (1 mL)
was added drop-by-drop to a solution of α-oxocarboxylic acids
(1 mmol) in ethanol (1 mL) over 30 min. After complete addition, the
reaction mixture was stirred for another 2 h at room temperature.
A gradual formation of a precipitate was observed. The resulting solid
was collected by filtration, washed with ethanol (2 × 10.0 mL)
and diethyl ether (10.0 mL), transferred to a round-bottom flask,
and dried under vacuum to give corresponding potassium salts of α-oxocarboxylic
acids.2

cooled down to room temperature, and the residue was diluted with
ethyl acetate (10 mL), washed with saturated sodium carbonate solution
(10 mL), and extracted with EtOAc (20 mL × 2). The combined organic
layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified through column
chromatography [100–200# silica, ethyl acetate/hexane = 3:7/4:6]
to afford the desired α-ketoamides product.
