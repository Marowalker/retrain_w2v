The solvent-induced topological and structural diversities of two
Co(II) complexes, namely, [Co(L)2(SCN)2] (Co1) and [Co2(L)2(SCN)(OAc)3] (Co2) (L = 8-methoxyquinoline), were comparatively
analyzed. Certain proportions of L, Co(OAc)2·4H2O, and NaSCN were mixed and dissolved in CH3OH
at 60 °C to obtain complex Co1. Complex Co2, an asymmetric dinuclear compound, was obtained by simply replacing
CH3OH with CH3CN as the solvent. The Co(II)
ion in complex Co1 was coordinated by the N4O2 mode provided by two L ligands and two SCN– anions. The two Co(II) ions in Co2 were in the N2O4 and NO5 coordination environment
and were linked by two μ2-OAc– bridges
and one rare μ3-OAc– bridge. Weak
interaction analysis revealed that complexes Co1 and Co2 exhibited 6-connected shp and 14-connected fcu nets, respectively.
Magnetic studies showed that Co1 demonstrated single-ion
magnet behavior under 2000 Oe. These behaviors are indicative of clearly
field-induced single-ion magnetic behavior with Ueff = 34.7(2) K and τ0 = 2.7(2) ×
10–7 s under 2000 Oe dc field, respectively. By
contrast, Co2 lacked frequency dependence under zero-field
conditions. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicated that
two complexes were stable in N,N-dimethylformamide.

Introduction
The design and synthesis of complexes with desirable clusters and diverse facilities
have drastically progressed over the past decade. The molecular structure
in the solid can be controlled to generate functional molecules with
newfangled topological structures and prospective properties.1 Three main approaches for regulating the synthesis
of complexes with different structures and functions exist: (1) the
change of metal ions with specific functions (Scheme 1).2 For
example, a monoelectron metallic ion is a prerequisite for the construction
of a magnetic material. (2) The change of different organic ligands.
Organic ligands play an important role in the formation of complexes.
The most important parameters for consideration in ligand selection
are coordinating ability, mode, flexibility/rigidity, and geometry.3 (3) The change of bridging and end-group ligands.4 Nevertheless, producing products with completely
different structures through solvent-induced methods, wherein the
reaction solvent is varied and other conditions, such as metal ions,
ligands, and bridging ligands, are held constant, is difficult and
rare.

Scheme 1 Solvent-Induced Synthesis of Complexes Co1 (Left) and Co2 (Right)
Recently, great progress has been made in 3d-based single-ion magnets
(SIMs),5,6 especially mononuclear cobalt complex. The
first example of field-induced Co-based SIM was published by Pardo
and his co-workers.7 This advancement is
an important deviation from former works on nanoparticles and provided
a new way of thinking about quantum magnetism.8−10 The Co(II)
ion has been studied more deeply because of its strong magnetic aeolotropism.
In 2014, the slow relaxation behavior was inspected with easy-plane
anisotropy, and the appearance was expounded by Gómez-Coca.11,12 The aeolotropism of the metal ions that form clusters clarifies
the entire magnetic behavior. Previous work has advanced from Mn12 clusters of mixed valence to mono-valent clusters containing
aeolotropic 3d metals, namely, because these clusters can construct
isomorphic structures with different magnetic aeolotropism.13−16 Numerous compounds based on these divalent Co(II) complexes exhibit
single-molecule magnetism.17−21 Therefore, a large amount of Co(II) complex is designed and synthesized
by various methods. According to the relevant principles, chemists
have designed and modified ligands, metal ions, and bridging ligands
in various ways to facilitate the construction of a wide range of
Co(II) single-molecule magnet (SMM).22 However,
there are rare examples of the construction of molecular materials
in which solvents induce different magnetic behaviors.

Herein, the rare solvent-induction synthesis of two structurally
different Co(II) complexes, namely, [(Co(L)2(SCN)2)] (1) and [Co2(L)2(SCN)(OAc)3] (2), was realized through the reaction of 8-methoxyquinoline
(L), NaSCN, and Co(OAc)2·4H2O at 60 °C
with different solvents. Specifically, complexes Co1 and Co2 were prepared using methanol and acetonitrile as solvents,
respectively. Both solvents are not involved in the products. Complexes Co1 and Co2 form 6-connected shp and 14-connected fcu nets,
respectively. Magnetic studies on two complexes show that Co1 exhibited SIM behavior under 2000 Oe dc field and that Co2 lacked frequency dependence under 0 Oe. Comparing the experimentally
obtained electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra with the simulated
spectra revealed that the fitting of the simulated data (D > 0) is better than that of experimental data (D < 0). The results of ESI-MS indicate that complexes Co1 and Co2 are stable in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).

Results and Discussion
Crystal Structure
X-ray results suggest that Co1 is a neutral uninuclear complex and crystallizes in the
monoclinic space group C2/c (Table S1a), in which the six-coordinated Co(II)
cores are surrounded by two N,O-chelated 8-methoxyquinolines and two
N atoms from two SCN– anions (Figure 1a). The two 8-methoxyquinoline and two SCN– ligands are cis to each other. By contrast, Co2 crystallizes in the P21/c space group with the monoclinic crystal system (Table S1a), which contains two six-coordinated
Co(II) ions. Both Co ions are connected by one 8-methoxyquinoline
ligand and two bridging μ2-CH3COO– anions. In addition, Co1 is surrounded
by one N,O-chelated 8-methoxyquinoline ligand and four O atoms from
three CH3COO– anions. Co2 is surrounded by one N,O-chelated 8-methoxyquinoline ligand, one
SCN–, and three O atoms from three CH3COO– anions (Figure 1b). Co···Co are bridged by three CH3COO– anions. Calculated results obtained
using SHAPE suggest that the geometry of the six-coordinative Co(II)
in Co1 and Co2 can be viewed as octahedral
in geometry (Tables S3–S5). The
distance between the Co(II) ion and ligand N atoms is approximately
2.08 Å. In Co1, the distances between the Co(II)
ion and SCN– N atoms are 1.999 and 2.004 Å
and those between the Co(II) ion and ligand O atoms are 2.309 and
2.371 Å. In Co2, the distances between Co and O
are within the limit of 1.988–2.255 Å and those between
Co and N are within the limit of 2.047–2.153 Å (Table S1b).

Figure 1 Complexes Co1 (a) and Co2 (b)’s
structures.

The supramolecular weak interaction of Co1 involves
C–H···N/S and π···π.
The distances of this supramolecular weak interaction are all within
a reasonable range (Figure S1a,b and Table S2). Thus, Co1 come down to a 6-connected shp net (Figure 2a) with distances of 5.22–6.03 Å between
the centers of Co(I). The supramolecular weak interaction of Co2 contains C–H···π and π···π
with distances that are all within a reasonable range (Figure S1c,d and Table S2). Thus, Co2 forms a 14-connected fcu net (Figure 2b) with length distances
of 10.68–12.25 Å between the centers of Co(II).

Thermal Analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was
accomplished to inspect the thermostabilization of Co1 and Co2. The crystals were heated up to 800 °C
in nitrogen gas with a heating speed of 5 °C/min. The first weight
loss platform (34.1%) experienced by Co1 from the temperature
extent of 30–250 °C, which accorded with the loss of the
coordinative ligand (calcd 32.3%). Co2 did not have free
solvents. The first weight loss platform of 17.8% experienced
by Co2 from the temperature extent of 30–180 °C,
which accorded to the loss of one coordinative SCN– and one coordinative CH3COO– (calcd
17.4%) (Figure S2b). The thermal behavior
and formula of Co1 and Co2 are consistent.

Magnetic Properties
The dc magnetic susceptibilities
of Co1 and Co2 were tested over the temperature
extent 2–300 K under 1000 Oe (Figure S3a,c). At 300 K, the χmT values are
2.97 cm3·K·mol–1 for Co1 and 5.75 cm3·K·mol–1 for Co2, which are bigger than the estimated 1.875
cm3·K·mol–1 for every uncorrelated
Co2+ ion value (S = 3/2) and indicate
the orbital contribution of Oh Co(II).23 These values are likely
due to the considerable magnetic aeolotropism of Co1 and Co2. At low temperature, χmT reduces slightly up to ca. 100 K (Co1) and 80 K (Co2) before experiencing a shallow minimal value at ca. 14
K (Co1) and 33 K (Co2), and a peak is finally
observed at 7 K for Co1, then quickly decreases to approximately
2.3 (Co1) and 3.7 (Co2) cm3·K·mol–1 at 2 K, respectively. The results of 1/χm versus T at 100–300 K according to
the Curie–Weiss law obtained calculated Curie values (C) of 2.98 and 5.94 cm3·K·mol–1 for Co1 and Co2, respectively. The Weiss
values (θ) of Co1 and Co2 are −0.75
and −8.89 K (Figure S3a,c), respectively.
The C constants are regular for Oh Co(II), negative θ constants
indicate intracluster AF coupling for Co2, and the contribution
of orbital from Co(II) ion is for Co1 and Co2. The M–H for complexes Co1 and Co2 was measured at 5 T (Figure S3b,d). The magnetization curves of Co1 and Co2 under Leigh magnetic intensities
of field suddenly increase before tardily increasing to 2.86 and 4.30
NμB at 2 K under 5 T, which exhibits that Co1 and Co2 express sizeable magnetic aeolotropism.

In order to understand the magnetic aeolotropism, the PHI program24 is used to fit the magnetic anisotropy of χmT versus T and M versus H curves at different temperatures by the
aid of an aeolotropic spin Hamiltonian (with gx = gy)  where D = axile ZFS factor, E = orthotropic ZFS factor, Ŝ =
polarization operator, B = magnetic detection, g = Landé parameter, and μB = Bohr
magneton. The best-fitting values are gx = gy = 2.69, gz = 2.21, D = +36.61 cm–1, E =
−1.02 cm–1, and TIP = 8.5 × 10–4 cm3·mol–1 with a residual of 2.03
× 10–3. In the fitting process, the symbol
of the D value is found to be critical and a good
fit is obtained with the positive D.

HF-EPR Studies of Co1
A high-frequency
EPR (HF-EPR) instrument is integrant, which further confirmed the
magnetic aeolotropism of Co1. HF-EPR instruments were
collected over the frequency range of 60–259 GHz in the interest
of getting a conclusive admeasurement of the ZFS factors.25 As the D values (36.61 cm–1) are going beyond the frequency extent in the instruments
(235 GHz—10 cm–1), between Kramers doublets mS = ±1/2 and mS = ±3/2, no transitions are inspected (Figure 3a). The HF-EPR spectrum of Co1 contains three symbols, representative for a spin S = 3/2 arrangement with huge and plus D values.
All EPR spectra indicates that the intra-Kramer transitions originate
in the lowest doublet mS = ±1/2 multiplied
by ΔmS = ±1, which confirms
the frequency dependence by observing the field of the inflection
point (Figure 3b).
HF-EPR spectra of Co1 could be well imitated by using
the D value measured by the SQUID instrument (Figure 3). The D value is affirmed to be plus. For Co1, the imitation
is made using the D factor achieved by SQUID (+36.62
cm–1), and the zero field splitting parameter E and the intrinsic g value are adjusted
at the same time, which provides an axial g-tensor
[gx = gy = 2.50(2), gz = 2.18(2)] and |E| = 5.32(5) cm–1 (|E/D| ≈
0.145). If the sign of the D value is set to a minus
value, a reasonable analog spectrum cannot be obtained (Figure 3a). It is worth noting that
because of the large D value and the limitations
of the technique, the transition between Kramers doublets mS = ±1/2 and mS = ±3/2 has not been observed, as shown by several single nuclear
Co(II) complexes.26 The obtained Hamilton
parameters are not extremely accurate, but the forward symbol of the D value has been clearly confirmed, which further indicates
existing plane magnetic aeolotropism of Co1.

line, D < 0) for complex Co1 at 2
K with experimental HF-EPR spectra (black line); (b) resonance field
vs microwave frequency of Co1. Solid lines represent
the linear fits. The vertical dotted lines represent the frequency
used to obtain the spectrum (170 GHz).

The dynamical magnetic characterizations of Co1 and Co2 were tested by instruments of ac magnetic susceptibilities.
Complex Co1 does not exhibit frequency dependence of
χ″ at zero dc-field from the 9 to 997 Hz frequencies
range (Figure 4a).
This discovery shows that moments are not blocked above 2 K. Under
the 2000 Oe static magnetic field, nevertheless, Co1 exhibits
the strong temperature and frequency dependence, that is, nonzero
χ″. From 2 to 6 K, the χ″ peaks can be observed,
indicating the presence of SMM behavior of Co1 (Figure 4b). By contrast, Co2 (Figure 4c) does not exhibit any χ″ symbol in the zero dc-field
at the frequencies of 1, 10, and 997 Hz above 2 K. No virtual components
were obtained.

Figure 4 Temperature-dependent χ′ and χ″ ac-susceptibilities
of Co1 at 0 (a) and 2000 Oe (b) dc-field, and ac-susceptibilities
of Co2 under 0 Oe dc-field (c).

The Cole–Cole data (Figure 5a–c) were modeled by using a universal Debye
model, and the fitted factors τ and α are listed in Table S6. For Co1, factor α
is within the limit of 0.05–0.15, which encompasses representative
CoII-based SMMs and reveals a single magnetic relaxation.
Temperature-dependent relaxation time was obtained under the assumption
of the Orbach process in accordance with the Arrhenius law (τ
= τ0 exp[Ueff/kBT]). The energy hill and attempt
time are Ueff = 34.7(2) K and τ0 = 2.7(2) × 10–7 s under 2000 Oe dc
field (Figure 5d),
respectively.

Figure 5 Frequency-dependent χ′/χ″ (Hdc = 2000 Oe) (a,b) and Cole–Cole plots (c) for Co1. The plots of ln τ vs T–1 under an optimum dc field for Co1, and the solid lines
demonstrate the fitting (d).

The monometallic contorted Oh CoII in complex Co1 can be ascribed
to the huge axial zero-field splitting (D = 36.61
cm–1 procured by magnetic data fitting), and ac
susceptibility instruments announce an aeolotropism fill of Ueff = 23.9 K. Complex Co2 also
shows contorted Oh coordinative
configuration about the Co centers, Co1···Co2 are bridged by three CH3COO– anions with the distance of 3.413 Å, the different coordinative
configuration, the structural distorted degree, and the ligand field
strength affect the anisotropy of CoII ions, and significant
easy-plane zero-field splitting prohibits any SMM behavior.

ESI-MS Analyses of Co1 and Co2
The stability of Co1 and Co2 in solution
was analyzed through ESI-MS. A small amount of the complexes was dissolved
in DMF, and the solution was diluted with acetonitrile (Figures 6 and S6). In the positive mode, the highest intensity peaks in Co1 and Co2 correspond to [CoL2] and [Co2L2], respectively. This correspondence suggests
that the core structures of Co1 and Co2 remain
intact in solution. The peaks at m/z = 422.08 and 349.03 are ascribed to [CoL(SCN)(C3H7NO)2]+ (b, calcd 422.08)
and [CoL(SCN)(C3H7NO)]+ (a, calcd 349.03), respectively, which both contain the CoL
core structure of Co1 (Table S7 and Figure S4). By contrast, the main peak for Co2 is at m/z = 613.04 and is assigned
to [Co2L2(CH3COO)3]+ (c, calcd 613.04). This peak is derived
from the dissociation of the terminal group of SCN–, and some peaks are similar to the main peak, like m/z = 539.01 and 585.05; they are assigned to [Co2L2(CN)(CH3COO)(OH)]+ (f, calcd 539.03) and [Co2L2(CH3COO)2(CH3O)]+ (e, calcd 585.05). A strong peak with the relative intensity of 0.955
at m/z = 527.03 attributed to [Co2L(CH3COO)3(C3H7NO)]+ (d, calcd 527.03) from the dissociation
of one L and one SCN– (Table S7 and Figure S5) is also present, and there are also some
peaks that dissociate one ligand, m/z = 453.97 and 499.03; they are assigned to [Co2L(CH3COO)3]+ (h, calcd 453.97)
and [Co2L(CH3COO)2(CH3O)(C3H7NO)]+ (g, calcd 499.03). In the negative mode, only the metal salt fragment
[Co(SCN)3]− (m/z, 232.86, calcd 232.86) is present regardless of the ion
source voltage (Figures S6–S8 and Table S8).

Conclusions
In summary, complexes Co1 and Co2 are
obtained through solvent-induced reaction. These complexes are structurally
different. For example, a rare μ3-OAc– bridge is present in Co2. Magnetic studies on complexes Co1 and Co2 indicate that Co1 exhibits
no frequency dependence at 0 Oe dc-field conditions and exhibits SIM
behavior at 2000 Oe. Given these characteristics, Co1 is an interesting addition to Co SIM families. Complex Co2 lacks frequency dependence under zero dc-field conditions. This
research provides an actual example of the construction of structurally
different complexes through the simple alteration of the reaction
solvent. It also illustrates that the solvent-induced method has considerable
potential for producing complexes with unique structures and properties.
This facile method provides a new avenue for the synthesis of multifunctional
molecules.

Experimental Section
Materials and Measurements
Commercial general solvents
and reagents were used without further purification. The Fourier transform
infrared spectra were collected with KBr pellets in the extent of
400–4000 cm–1 on a phycoerythrin spectrum
spectrometer. Elemental analyses (C, H, N, and S) were tested on a
vario MICRO cube 2400. The thermal analysis was performed on LABSYS
thermogravimetry–differential thermal analysis at a heating
speed of 5 °C/min in N2. The diffraction data for
complexes 1 and 2 were gathered in Φ
and ω scan modes on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer (λ
= 0.71073 Å, Mo Kα radiation). The compound structures
were worked by the immediate means, which succeeded by the difference
Fourier synthesis method, and then the whole-matrix least square technique
on the F2 was refined by the SHELXL.27 The hydrogen atom is placed in the calculative
position, and the equidirectional refinement is performed using a
horse-riding model. Table S1 provides an
overview of the X-ray crystallography data and refinement details
of these complexes. The CCDC numbers are 1874410 (Co1) and 1874411 (Co2). Temperature- and magnetic field-related
magnetic susceptibility measurement by using QD MPMS SQUID-XL-5 magnetometer
has been implemented. The tested polarization rate is
checked to the diamagnetism of the constituent atoms. In the sample,
for preventing the free movement of the grains, the silicone grease
is used for embedding. The diamagnetic checks for all compounds were
reckoned using Pascal’s constants, and silicone grease is used
for embedding in samples that prevent free movement of particles.28 ESI-MS data were tested at 275 °C with
Thermo Exactive. The injection speed is 0.3 mL/h in the range of 200–2000 m/z.
