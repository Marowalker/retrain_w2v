Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a key regulator of mitosis and a recognized
drug target for cancer therapy. Inhibiting the polo-box domain of
PLK1 offers potential advantages of increased selectivity and subsequently
reduced toxicity compared with targeting the kinase domain. However,
many if not all existing polo-box domain inhibitors have been shown
to be unsuitable for further development. In this paper, we describe
a novel compound series, which inhibits the protein–protein
interactions of PLK1 via the polo-box domain. We combine high throughput
screening with molecular modeling and computer-aided design, synthetic
chemistry, and cell biology to address some of the common problems
with protein–protein interaction inhibitors, such as solubility
and potency. We use molecular modeling to improve the solubility of
a hit series with initially poor physicochemical properties, enabling
biophysical and biochemical characterization. We isolate and characterize
enantiomers to improve potency and demonstrate on-target activity
in both cell-free and cell-based assays, entirely consistent with
the proposed binding model. The resulting compound series represents
a promising starting point for further progression along the drug
discovery pipeline and a new tool compound to study kinase-independent
PLK functions.

==== Body
Introduction
Polo-like kinase (PLK1) is a key regulator of cell cycle progression
and is a member of a family of closely related multifunctional kinases
comprising PLK1, PLK2, PLK3, and PLK4. During mitosis, PLK1 has many
crucial functions, from timely mitotic entry to successful cytokinesis
and is critical for bipolar spindle formation and for correct chromosome
segregation. In clinical terms, PLK1 is dysregulated in a wide range of human tumors, and
its level of expression correlates with a poor prognosis.1 In addition, numerous cell-line studies demonstrate
that PLK1 overexpression induces a transformed phenotype in noncancer
cell lines, and inhibition of PLK1 can selectively kill tumor cells.2−6 Drug discovery approaches to targeting protein kinases have traditionally
focussed around the kinase active site, and such inhibitors of PLK1
show some promise in the clinic.7,8 However, accompanying
toxicity and the potential for the emergence of resistance are likely
to limit the use of such agents. The development of protein–protein
interaction (PPI) inhibitors provides an alternative and potentially
more selective approach and one, which lends itself well to targeting
PLK1 due to the modular nature of the enzyme. PLK1 is composed of
two main structural elements: a kinase domain, which phosphorylates
a great many proteins during mitosis, and a polo-box domain (PBD),
comprising two polo-box units, which provides spatio-temporal regulation
through interaction with its substrates.9,10 These two
domains are joined by a linker of approximately 50 residues. The kinase
domain has been crystallized in the presence and absence of bound
inhibitors and shows similarity to many other kinases.11 The PBD has been crystallized in the presence
and absence of bound phosphopeptides, and, in contrast, it has a unique
structure, shared only with other members of the PLK family.12 The PBD offers both the phosphopeptide binding
groove and the more recently described tyrosine pocket10,13−15 as possible sites for small-molecule inhibition and
potentially a means to overcome some of the problems of kinase inhibitors.
In the last few years, studies on a number of small-molecule inhibitors
of the PBD of PLK1 have been published.16−21 However, recent work has raised questions over the mechanism of
action for some of these inhibitors, casting doubt over the suitability
for further development.22 Here, we describe
a novel drug-like series for the inhibition of the PLK1 PBD. We characterize
key members of the series using a panel of cell-free, biophysical,
and cell-based assays to show on-target activity, alongside the use
of molecular modeling to inform synthetic chemistry and improve physicochemical
properties.

Results and Discussion
Fluorescence Polarization Screen Identifies Inhibitors of the
PLK1 Polo-box Domain
A fluorescence polarization (FP) assay
was developed to identify compounds that inhibit the binding of a
consensus phosphopeptide to the PBD domain of PLK1. The assay was
then used to screen a diverse library of approximately 86 000
compounds as described previously.23 Some
of the primary hits were not reproducible or were identified as pan
assay interference compounds (PAINS)24 (Table S1). In some cases, highly fluorescent
compounds (Table S1) also generated false
positives. These compounds were excluded from further development.
After removing these spurious results, the screen yielded a hit rate
of 0.06% leaving 53 remaining compounds as robust primary hits. The
primary hits contained a number of promising chemical scaffolds including
the recently reported Poloppins.23 In this
paper, we focus on the series of compounds derived from compound 1 (Table 1).

Table 1 FP Results for the Primary Hit Compound 1 and a Set of Its Commercially Available Analoguesa
a All values represent the mean of
three independent experiments ± standard deviation. ND = Not
detectable.

Following confirmation of activity by repeat screening in the FP
assay, a number of commercially available analogues were purchased
for all primary hits, to generate early structure–activity
relationship (SAR) data. We used the clusters generated in the library
design stage to randomly select analogues of each hit molecule. These
analogues were then tested by FP (Table 1 and Figure S1). The LHSpT peptide, a minimal phosphopeptide recognizing the PLK1
PBD,25 was included as a positive control.
All of the compounds in Table 1, with the exception of compound 5, showed dose-dependent
inhibition of phosphopeptide binding in the FP assay (Figure S1). Further, additional compound 1 analogues were purchased and tested in the FP assay; however,
at a concentration of 50 μM, none showed activity above 10%
inhibition in the assay and the inherent poor aqueous solubility of
these compounds prevented testing at higher concentrations (Table S2). Compound 1 remained the
most potent of the compounds tested. Compounds 2 and 5 indicate the importance of the terminal phenyl ring, while
compounds 3 and 4 highlight the methyl substituent
and the sulfur atom in the benzothiazinone, respectively (Table 1).

Molecular Modeling Informs Synthetic Chemistry To Improve Solubility
Despite the promising results from FP screening, we were unable
to further characterize the compounds in biophysical or cell-based
assays due to the observed poor solubility. To remedy this problem,
we attempted to improve the physicochemical properties of compound 1 to generate compounds that retained activity while showing
increased aqueous solubility. To aid in this process, we generated
binding modes for compound 1 using molecular docking
with Glide. The predicted pose can be seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Binding mode of compound 1 to the polo-box domain
(PBD) of PLK1 (PDBID 3BZI) predicted by Glide docking. The protein is displayed as atom colored
space filling with gray carbons and the ligand is displayed as atom
colored balls and sticks with green carbons. Only polar hydrogen atoms
are displayed, and a selection of residues are labeled.

Compound 1 was docked to two PLK1 PBD structures (PBDID 3BZI and PDBID 3P37). Interestingly,
the compound is not predicted to bind to the His 538/Lys 540 pincer,
which binds the phosphate group of the phosphopeptide binding partners.9,26 This is in line with the difficulty in disrupting the strongly bound
network of water molecules in this region.10 The predicted binding modes for the two structures show an excellent
overlap, and in both cases, the molecule is predicted to lie in the
phosphopeptide binding groove by stacking on the residue Trp 414 and
extends into a cryptic hydrophobic pocket lined by Tyr 417, Tyr 421,
and Tyr 485. This pocket has previously been implicated in the binding
of artificial peptide analogues14 and more
recently a subset of natural PLK1 substrates.15 The high Glide XP Scores of −11.7 and −12.1 kcal/mol
alongside the MM-GBSA scores of −95.3 and −92.9 kcal/mol
were encouraging, and the predicted binding mode was in line with
the SAR derived from the compounds in Table 1, increasing its credibility. In particular,
the terminal phenyl ring fills the cryptic hydrophobic pocket, the
methyl group is positioned in a small cavity between Leu 119, Val
415, and Tyr 485, and the sulfur atom lies on the hydrophobic surface
formed from the sidechain of Trp 414. Using this model, we designed
and synthesized a series of close analogues of compound 1 that were predicted to show improved solubility without having a
deleterious effect on the activity. Notably, changes around the terminal
phenyl ring (one edge of which is solvent-exposed in the putative
binding pose) were predicted to be tolerated. The docking mode suggests
that changes to the ortho, meta, and para positions should all be
allowed (see Figure 1). For ease of synthesis, we focused on changes to this end of the
molecule by amide coupling a number of commercially available amines
to a commercially available acid. Compounds were selected with high
similarity to compound 1 but with an increased polar
atom count. No changes were made to the sulfone group, alkyl chain,
or amide groups, which link the two ends of the molecule together.
These orient the molecule, and the sulfone is predicted to make a
hydrogen bond with the protein backbone. The solubility of these analogues
is shown in Table 2, where the turbidity of compounds in aqueous solution is used to
indicate solubility.

Table 2 Solubility of a Set of Compound 1 Analogues Designed to Increase Aqueous Solubilitya
a Turbidity was experimentally determined
by measuring absorbance at 625 nm at 250 μM, and values are
relative to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). All turbidity values are the
mean of three independent experiments ± standard deviation.

Compounds 6 and 9 showed a substantial
improvement in solubility through increased polarity around the terminal
phenyl ring, Crucially, this increase in solubility enabled further
characterization of compound 9 (Figure 2A).

Figure 2 Optimized soluble analogue, compound 9, is active
in FP (A) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (B) assays. (C)
Activity of the isolated enantiomers of compound 9 in
the FP assay. For FP assays, values are the mean of three independent
experiments ± SD. A representative experiment is shown for ITC.
The experiment was carried out in duplicate.

Compound 9 was more active in the FP assay with an
IC50 of 36 μM. The improved aqueous solubility for
compound 9 also allowed us to determine a Kd of 20 μM using isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) (Figure 2B),
which is consistent with the results of the FP assay. As a part of
an ongoing campaign to test the predicted binding mode in Figure 1 and improve the
binding affinity, we designed and tested a number of further analogues,
and among them, compounds (−)–9 and (+)–9, the pair of enantiomers comprising compound 9, are a racemic mix (Table 3).

Table 3 FP Results for a Set of Compound 1 Analogues Designed to Test the Predicted Binding Mode and
Improve the Binding Affinitya
a All IC50 values were
measured by FP, and values represent the mean of three independent
experiments ± standard deviation. ND = not determinable. * Stereochemistries
were assigned arbitrarily.

In the FP assay, (−)–9 showed an increase
in potency over the parental compound (24.4 μM), while (+)–9 was considerably less potent, showing only mild
activity (Figure 2C).
The predicted binding mode can accommodate both enantiomers, consistent
with some activity for both compounds in the assay, but in one case,
the methyl group is solvent-exposed and in the other, it contacts
the protein. This data is thus commensurate with the predicted binding
mode. Additional analogues added further confidence to the predicted
binding mode (Table 3). For example, the para position of the phenyl ring can accommodate
a number of substitutions (compounds 12 and 13), consistent with its lack of protein contacts in the predicted
binding mode. The importance of the 3-thiomorpholinone heterocycle
is underlined by a lack of measurable affinity for compound 16 and this is also in line with the predicted binding mode,
where the amide hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen in the ring make hydrogen
bonds with the backbone of residue Trp 414. When compound 15 is docked, the binding mode is maintained, but the bond between
the sulfone group and the thiomorpholinone ring is rotated such that
it still stacks on Trp 414 but no longer makes hydrogen-bonding contacts
with the backbone. This is in line with its slightly reduced activity
(111.5 vs 73.1 μM). Compound 16 loses the stacking
as well as the hydrogen-bonding contacts and is inactive. Conversely,
converting the 3-thiomorpholinone ring to a 3-morpholinone ring (compound 10) retains activity, consistent with its lack of protein
contacts. Although compound 11 appeared to have improved
potency, neither of the isolated enantiomers, (−)–11 and (+)–11, matched this improvement. The reason
for this observation was not clear, so this compound was not taken
further.

Improved Soluble Analogue Shows on-Target Activity in Cell-Based
Assays
With excellent solubility and in vitro evidence for
target engagement from the FP and ITC assays (Figure 2), compound 9 was tested for
cell-based activity alongside the isolated enantiomer pair, (−)–9 and (+)–9. The compounds
were tested in a high-content mitotic index assay designed to identify
molecules, which are able to cause a mitotic arrest (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 Dose-dependent increase in mitotic arrest with chromosome congression
defects is caused upon treatment with Compound 9 and
its enantiomers. (A) Cells were treated with Compound 9 and its enantiomers, compounds (−)–9 and (+)–9 (at 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 0 μM)
and corresponding DMSO controls for 12 h. Mitotic cells scored as
phospho-histone H3-stained cells per 2000 Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei
in a high-content screening platform as described earlier.27 Each bar is a mean of three replicates ±
standard error of the mean (SEM). The data presented is representative
of two independent experiments. (B) HeLa cells were treated with compound (−)–9/DMSO for 12 h, as shown in A. The cells
were fixed and stained for DNA and β-tubulin. Mitotic cells
were identified by microscopy and scored under three categories: (a)
misaligned chromosomes and monopolar spindles, (b) misaligned chromosomes
and bipolar spindles, and (c) aligned chromosomes and bipolar spindles.
The quantification of the cellular phenotype is shown in the histogram.
(C) Representative maximal-intensity projection images of cells in
each category (as in B) showing DNA in blue and spindle microtubules
in red. The scale bar is 3 μm.

Small-molecule inhibition of PLK1 by either kinase inhibitors28−31 or inhibitors of the polo-box domain23 has been shown to inhibit timely progression through mitosis, giving
rise to an increased mitotic index. Compound 9 and (−)–9 both showed a robust increase in mitotic
arrest (4-fold), while (+)–9 gave a much milder
effect, confirming that (−)–9 is the active
enantiomer as predicted by the FP assay results (Figure 2C). In addition, examination
of the images from high-content analysis revealed cells arrested in
prometaphase with misaligned chromosomes, a phenotype characteristic
of inhibition of PLK1 via the PBD (Figure S2). Closer examination and quantitation of the mitotic phenotype by
confocal microscopy confirmed that the predominant phenotype was arrested
in prometaphase with a bipolar spindle and noncongressed chromosomes
(Figure 3B,C). This
phenotype has been consistently reported as a direct result of inhibition
of the PBD, and it is distinct from the monopolar phenotype seen when
PLK1 kinase activity is directly inhibited either by small molecules
or by depletion of the protein using RNA interference.26,32 Thus, these observations provide strong support that compound (−)–9 is an inhibitor of the PLK1 PBD both in
a cell-free setting and within the cellular milieu.

We sought further evidence that the action of compound (−)–9 was through inhibition of the PBD of PLK1 by examining localization
of the PLK1 protein in compound-treated cells. Using a previously
described HeLa cell line with a doxycycline-inducible overexpression
of GFP-tagged PLK1,15 we looked at localization
of the fluorescently tagged protein in mitosis. Mutations of the PBD
at residues His 538 and Lys 540 within the phosphopeptide binding
groove or at residues Tyr 421, Leu 478, and Tyr 481 within the tyrosine
pocket have been shown to disrupt the interaction of PLK1 with critical
mitotic substrates and result in loss of GFP-PLK1 from the kinetochores.15 This phenotype was recapitulated upon treatment
of cells with compound (−)–9, showing a
clear decrease in kinetochore localization of GFP-PLK1 (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Treatment with compound (−)–9 causes
mislocalization of PLK1 from kinetochores in mitotic cells. (A) Cells
expressing GFP-PLK1 were treated with compound (−)–9 or DMSO for 9.5 h after double thymidine release. The cells were
fixed, stained for DNA (Hoechst) and kinetochores (CREST antisera),
and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Prometaphase mitotic
cells were identified based on DNA morphology, and 1 μm confocal
Z-stacks were taken for each cell. Quantification of GFP-PLK1 intensity
on CREST-stained kinetochores was carried out using ImageJ. The data
is represented as the Whisker maximum to minimum plot with a horizontal
bar indicating mean GFP-PLK1 intensity on kinetochores. Statistical
analysis was done using a nonparametric, Mann–Whitney two-tailed
test with a 95% confidence interval, **p = 0.0037.
8 cells were analyzed for DMSO and 7 for compound (−)–9. (B) Representative maximal-intensity projection images of cells
showing CREST-stained kinetochores (red), GFP-PLK1 (green), and DNA
(blue) used for quantification of GFP-PLK1 intensity in Figure 4A. The scale bar is 5 μm.

While this provides strong evidence that this compound can inhibit
the PBD of PLK1 in cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that these
compounds may also inhibit the PBD of other PLK family members. Indeed,
a sequence alignment of the PBD of the PLK family suggests that achieving
selectivity for PLK1 will be challenging but possible. The overall
sequence identity with the PLK1 PBD is 38.67% for PLK2 and 39.01%
for PLK3, but the key contact residues have a high similarity (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Sequence alignment of the PBDs of the PLK family. Sequences of
human PLK1 residues 410–603, PLK2 residues 503–685,
and PLK3 residues 463–646 were taken from UniProt. PLK4 and
PLK5 were excluded from the analysis as they have markedly different
structures and functions. The alignment was performed by Clustal Omega
using default parameters. Residues in the phosphopeptide binding groove
and cryptic hydrophobic pocket are highlighted in bold. Residues in
the phosphopeptide binding groove and cryptic hydrophobic pocket with
complete conservation across the PLK family are in red and those which
differ are in blue.

In particular, selectivity may be achievable by targeting the Thr
477/Leu 478 (TL) pair at the end of the cryptic hydrophobic pocket,
which are TV in PLK2 and GI in PLK3. In addition, the pair of residues
Arg516/Phe535 are lysine and tyrosine in PLK2 and PLK3. Measuring
the selectivity of this series across the PLK family should be the
focus of future work.

Conclusions
This paper describes screening for PPI inhibitors and subsequent
hit identification and optimization of a promising new compound series
for inhibition of the PBD of PLK1. Protein–protein interactions
have long been considered challenging targets for drug discovery,
and to address this, we started with a PPI-focused library of approximately
86 000 commercially available compounds. Many of the primary
hits from FP screening were false positives, highlighting the need
for thorough validation and awareness of common liabilities. Due to
the nature of PPIs, poor compound solubility can be a problem as many
small-molecule inhibitors have significant hydrophobic character and
derive their binding affinity from nonpolar interactions.33 In this case, poor solubility of the primary
hit precluded the initial advancement of the series, but we were able
to use molecular modeling to generate a predicted binding pose, which
guided the introduction of small structural changes designed to improve
solubility. It is worth noting that such improvements may be easier
to achieve in PPIs than traditional
targets, due to the inherent solvent exposure of the inhibitors.34 Sequence analysis suggests that achieving selectivity
for PLK1 over PLK2 and PLK3 may be challenging but should be achievable
by targeting specific residues that differ between these domains.

Thus, we have combined computational techniques, synthetic chemistry,
and a robust FP assay for the design, synthesis, and characterization
of analogues, with small structural changes, to successfully remedy
the solubility problems and facilitate further development of the
compound series. This initial campaign has resulted in a cell-permeable,
small-molecule series with low molecular weight and evidence of target
engagement in both cell-free and cell-based assays. Further work will
be required to identify whether this is a PLK1-specific or pan-PLK
inhibitor. However, we propose that this series may be a good candidate
for further elaboration towards chemical probe development and/or
a cancer drug discovery program.

Methods
Library Design
The small-molecule library for high
throughput screening (HTS) was design and assembled in-house from
commercial vendors (Table 4).

The complete set of approximately 3 million compounds was filtered
aggressively using the FILTER program (OpenEye). We employed the REOS
substructure filters,35 OpenEye’s
FILTER filters, and a set of physicochemical property filters developed
for PPI inhibitors (Table 5).

Table 5 Limits on the Physicochemical Properties
Used to Filter the HTS Library

hydrogen bond acceptors	0	10	
hydrogen bond donors	0	6	
clog P	–5.0	6.0	
rotatable bonds	0	10	
chiral centers	0	4	
These criteria are wider than those typically used to generate
screening libraries,36 and these are based
on recent studies.37,38 This filtering step removed approximately
50% of the compounds from consideration. The next stage was then selection
of a diverse subset of the remaining compounds. This process was performed
using directed sphere exclusion39 with
Canvas (Schrödinger, LLC). Each compound was assigned radial
fingerprints40 with daylight atom types
and a radius of 4. The compound similarity was assessed using the
Tanimoto metric.41 Compounds were then
selected iteratively, with the requirement that no selected compound
had a Tanimoto similarity greater than 0.8 to any previously selected
compound. This process yielded a set of approximately 43 000
compounds. Each of these compounds was defined as the center of a
cluster, and another molecule with a Tanimoto similarity greater than
0.8 to the cluster center was randomly selected for each cluster.
This ensures that some basic SAR will be present in the primary screening
data. This led to the selection of approximately 86 000 compounds.
An additional 12 000 peptide-mimic compounds were also tested,42 bringing the screening library to 98 000
compounds.

Protein Preparation
A region of the human PLK1 cDNA
sequence (residues 345–603) was amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and cloned into a pGEX-6P1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) to generate a recombinant protein in C41 strain Escherichia coli.43 Bacteria
were disrupted using an Emulsiflex c5 homogenizer (Avestin), and lysates
were passed onto a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Sepharose column
in the presence of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, and 1 mM DTT. Bound fractions were cleaved on the column at
4 °C overnight with PreScission protease (GE healthcare). Purified
fractions were polished by gel chromatography using a Sephadex G25
(GE healthcare) column, collected and concentrated. Fractions were
tested by Western blotting using the PLK1 antibody (Invitrogen 33–1700)
to validate protein purification.

Fluorescence Polarization Assay
The HTS was conducted
using a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay, as described in Narvaez
et al.23 All peptides and phosphopeptides
were synthesized using standard chemistry (Designer Bioscience Ltd.,
Cambridge, U.K.). The fluorescently labeled probe was the phosphopeptide
sequence MAGPMQSpTPLNGAKK with N-terminal TAMRA. FP measurements were
carried out in 384-well, low-volume, black, flat-bottom polystyrene N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) microplates (Corning 3820) using
a PHERAstar Plus plate reader (BMGLabtech). The final assay volume
of 45 μL contained a 10 nM labeled probe peptide, 84 nM PBD,
and varying concentrations of the competitor. Assays were carried
out in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) plus 0.03% tween.
FP values were obtained in millipolarization units at an excitation
wavelength of 540 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Compounds
were screened at an average concentration of 125 μM. All of
the hits identified in the primary screen were then reanalyzed at
a range of concentrations to generate dosimetry curves. DMSO controls
were run alongside all experimental compounds, and % inhibition was
normalized to these controls. The unlabeled LHSpT peptide was used
as a positive control. % inhibition values were calculated using GraphPad
Prism.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
ITC measurements were
performed in duplicate, as described in Narvaez et al.23 In all titrations, protein PBD345–603
was used at 25 μM and buffered in HEPES (50 mM, pH 7.4), NaCl
(200 mM), and DTT (1 mM). Protein was diluted into a buffer with DMSO
at 5% (v/v). Compounds were prepared by diluting from DMSO stock into
the same buffer containing DMSO at 5% (v/v). Great care was taken
to match the concentration of DMSO in the ligand and protein samples
as closely as possible. In a typical experiment, protein (25 μM)
was loaded in the sample cell, and a total of 20 injections of 8 μL
were made at 2 min intervals from a 200 μL syringe rotating
at 1000 rpm and loaded with the ligand solution (0.5 mM). In all titrations,
an initial injection of 2 μL ligand was made, and these data
were discarded during data analysis. The thermodynamic parameters
were obtained by fitting the data to a single-site binding model with
a stoichiometry of 1. ITC experiments were performed at 20 °C
with a MicroCal ITC200 instrument, and all data were analyzed with
the software implemented in Origin (version 7).

Turbidity Assay
50 mM compound stock solutions in DMSO
were diluted to 250 μM in dH2O. 50 μL of the
diluted compounds was aliquoted into flat-bottom 96-well plates and
incubated at room temperature for 20 min before absorbance at 625
nM and it was read using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader. Absorbance
readings were normalized to DMSO controls.

Binding Pose Prediction
Before analysis, all structures
were prepared using Schrödinger’s Preparation Wizard44 using the default settings to check all protonation
states as well as the orientations of asparagine, glutamine, and histidine
residues. All water molecules were deleted prior to the analysis.
Molecular docking was performed using Schrödinger’s
Glide 4.045 with the PDB structures 3BZI(43) and 3P37.13 These structures have the PLK1 PBD
cryptic pocket in an open state, as we believed that this hydrophobic
pocket would be important in binding small-molecule inhibitors. For
the grid generation and ligand docking procedures, the default Glide
settings were used. All structures were docked and scored using the
Glide extra-precision (XP)46 and rescored
using an MM-GBSA method.47

Cell Culture
HeLa FlpIn T-REx cells (a kind gift from
Professor Steve Taylor, University of Manchester) were cultured at
37 °C under 5% CO2 in DMEM with GlutaMAX (Life Technologies),
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, Zeocin (Invitrogen) at 0.05
mg/mL, and Blasticidin (InvivoGen) at 4 μg/mL. All GFP-PLK1
HeLa FlpIn T-REx cell lines were generated and maintained as described
in Sharma et al.15 Doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich)
at 0.1 mg/mL was used for induction of the GFP-fusion protein.

Mitotic Index (MI) Assay
HeLa FlpIn T-REx cells were
arrested in early S-phase in growth media containing 2 mM thymidine
(Sigma) for 16 h. Cells were then released for 8 h in thymidine-free
media, and these were then arrested again with thymidine for 16 h
followed by the release in thymidine-free media. Cells were treated
for 12 h with DMSO or compounds, and then these were fixed in 3.7%
formaldehyde (Agar Scientific). Cells were permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100, and then these were incubated with anti-phospho-histone
H3 (Ser10) antibody (Abcam ab5176). The cells were washed with PBS,
and then these were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Invitrogen A11034) in the presence of 4 μg/mL Hoechst 33342
(Invitrogen H3570). Cells were washed in PBS, and then these were
imaged on an Arrayscan VTi HCS instrument (Thermo Fisher) using the
Target Activation V4 BioApplication. Mitotic cells were scored as
phospho-histone H3-stained cells per 2000 Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei,
as described in Ibbeson et al.27

Immunofluorescence (IF) and Image Analysis
Cells were
fixed on a coverslip with 4% formaldehyde (Agar Scientific) for 10
min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-100 (Fisher), 0.1%
Tween-20 (NBS Biologicals) in 1× PBS (PBS-Triton-Tween) for 10
min and blocked with 1% BSA (Fisher Scientific) in PBS-Triton-Tween
for 30 min. CREST antisera (Europa FZ90C-CS1058) was diluted 1:1000
in the blocking solution, and cells were incubated in humidified chambers
for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with blocking
solution, and the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, 1:500) for 30 min. Cells
were washed thrice in the blocking solution and mounted in the 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) containing medium (Vectashield). The samples were stored in
dark at 4 °C before microscopy. The fixed cell images were captured
using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 63× or 100×
1.4 NA/oil objective with Z-stacks of confocal slices taken at 1 μm
intervals. Pixel intensities were never saturated; laser exposure
and detector settings were identical between samples across an experiment.
The ImageJ software was used for image analysis. CREST staining was
used as a mask to determine the average GFP-PLK1 staining intensity
in CREST-stained kinetochores.
