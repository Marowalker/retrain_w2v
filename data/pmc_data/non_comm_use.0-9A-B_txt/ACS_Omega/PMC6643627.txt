The complex structure of activated
carbon can be described as a three-dimensional network of graphene
layers oriented in random directions. In this work, we propose a new
model of the microporous structure, taking into account the degree
of activation. We derive a structural relation between porosity, skeletal
density, specific surface area, and the number of graphitic blocks
per unit volume. In addition, we present a new approach to evaluate
the interdependency between porosity and specific surface area by
combining high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy
and subcritical nitrogen adsorption. Finally, we propose a structural
metric that predicts the relation between the volumetric storage capacity
and the gravimetric storage capacity of supercritical methane at room
temperature.

1 Introduction
Adsorbed
natural gas is an energy-efficient technology for storing natural
gas (NG) at low pressure and room temperature. Storing natural gas
by adsorption offers several advantages over liquefied natural gas
and compressed natural gas technologies. The adsorbent materials used
in NG storage and transport offer advantages such as decreasing the
operating pressure of the gaseous fuel tank at a given gas density
and increasing the NG storage capacity at a given pressure. Activated
carbon is an adsorbent material with various applications in water
treatment, medical poisoning, chemical purification, and gas separation,
capture, and storage.1−5 Porosity is created in carbonaceous or lignocellulose materials
through physical or chemical activation.6−8 During physical activation,
porosity is created when gasifying agents (CO2, O2, steam, etc.) remove carbon atoms from the structure. For chemical
activation, impregnation with chemicals (H3PO4, ZnCl2, KOH, K2CO3, etc.) is used
to create the porosity.9−11 Several models have been historically developed to
describe microporosity in activated carbon. Kaneko et al. used the
graphitic microcrystallite model to describe the changes in specific
surface area as a function of thickness and size of the graphitic
microcrystallite wall.12 However, activated
carbon is a nongraphitizing carbon, and X-ray diffraction experiments
show that activated carbon (AC) does not have meaningful crystallite
components.1

The Advanced Research
Projects Agency-Energy of the United States Department of Energy (DOE)
has initiated a research program known as MOVE: Methane Opportunities
for Vehicular Energy. The program aims to develop materials for natural
gas storage at low pressure and room temperature. The DOE has defined
storage metrics to assess the performance of sorbents; the target
for gravimetric storage density is 0.5 g/g, and the target for volumetric
energy density is 12.5 MJ/L. Activated carbon, covalent organic frameworks,
and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are the leading materials
used for adsorbed natural gas storage, reaching approximately 50%
of the gravimetric storage target and 75% of the volumetric storage
target.13−24 In the present work, we develop a model of activated carbon that
takes into account the degree of activation by comparing the structural
data of a high-surface-area (2800 m2/g) carbon with complete
activation and a low-surface-area (700 m2/g) carbon with
partial activation. While most research in this field focuses on gravimetric
and volumetric storage capacities separately, this work investigates
the interdependency between these two parameters.

2 Results and Discussion
The proposed model of activated carbon
takes into account the degree of activation. A complete activation
method results in a single layer of graphene sheets (N = 1) oriented in random directions and in surface area larger than
2630 m2/g. Figure 1 shows the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
micrograph of a fully activated carbon with a KOH/C ratio of 3:1.
A further aggressive activation results in the decrease of the size
of the graphene sheet and an increase in the specific surface area.
The extra surface area compared to an infinitely large graphene sheet
results from edge sites of truncated graphene sheets. It has a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of 2800 m2/g and granular porosity of
0.79. This is typical of high-end activated carbons. A partial activation
method results in partial activation (N > 1) with
a combination of graphene layers and nonactivated components resulting
in a lower surface area of 900 m2/g and a granular porosity
of 0.52. These smaller values are consistent with the lack of activation. Figure 2 shows the pore size
distribution (PSD) for each sample calculated using quenched solid
density functional theory (QSDFT). A fully activated carbon has a
bimodal pore size distribution with peaks at 7.5 and 20 Å. On
the other hand, a partially activated carbon has a narrower distribution
of pore sizes, with the main peak at 7.5 Å.

of 3 K (fully activated carbon, N = 1). Left: STEM
micrographs of HS;0B (partially activated carbon, N > 1).

carbon (red) and a partially activated carbon (blue).

Table 1 defines the parameters used in this model. The area occupied
by one carbon atom in a graphene sheet is the area of the unit cell
(detailed derivation is provided in the Supporting Information) 1  Theoretical skeletal density of activated
carbon is 2  The
number of carbon atoms in a square graphene sheet with side L is 3  These
areas are geometric surface areas and not derived from subcritical
nitrogen isotherms. The planar contribution is 4  The edge contribution is 5  The total geometrical surface area is the sum of the planar ∑planar and the edge ∑edge contributions. 6  The
porosity is defined as the volume fraction of pores in activated carbon 7  Figure 3 shows the edge and the planar contributions
to the specific surface area. The total surface area is the sum of
the planar and edge contributions. The planar surface area, which
has been extensively reported for graphene,25is constant and independent of the average graphene length. The edge
contribution decreases and becomes negligible for L larger than 100 Å. For a fully activated carbon (N = 1), the total surface area decreases by increasing the average
graphene length and it will reach 2626 m2/g for large L. Figure 4 shows the total specific surface area for partially activated carbon
with multilayers (N > 1) and its dependency on
the degree of activation. A complete activation method results in
a single layer of graphene sheets (N = 1) oriented
in random directions and in surface area larger than 2626 m2/g. A partial activation results in a combination of graphene layers
and nonactivated graphitic components (N > 1).
For N = 2, the total surface area reaches 1313 m2/g for large L (for N =
3, it reaches 980 m2/g; for N = 4, it
reaches 656 m2/g; for N = 5, it reaches
525 m2/g; for N = 6, it reaches 438 m2/g; and for N = 7, it reaches 375 m2/g). Table 2 shows
the average length of a graphene sheet and the average number of graphitic
components per unit volume.

Previously proposed models for microporosity
in activated carbon treat surface area and porosity as two independent
variables. By fixing the limits of the length of the graphene sheet
(L) between 100 and 180 Å, and by modifying
the average number of graphene layers in graphite (N), we compute the relation between porosity and specific surface
area. Figure 5 shows
the relation between porosity and surface area for L = 100 Å up to L = 180 Å.

Figure 5 Relation between specific
surface area and porosity.

The specific surface area and porosity are two dependent
variables considering the degree of activation in microporous carbon.
We determine the average length of a graphene sheet (L) and the average number of graphitic blocks per unit volume using eqs 10 and 11, respectively. In eq 10, the experimental
surface area is determined from subcritical nitrogen adsorption and
the average number of graphene layers in graphite from high-resolution
STEM. Table 2 shows
that sample 3 K has an average length of 100 Å and sample HS;0B
has an average length of 180 Å. These results are consistent
with high-resolution STEM. Using the experimental porosity measured
from subcritical nitrogen adsorption, we find that sample 3 K has
6.5 × 1024 graphitic blocks per cubic meter while
sample HS;0B has 1.2 × 1024.

Chahine et al.
have shown that the gravimetric excess
adsorption is directly proportional to the specific surface area.26,27 However, for gas storage application, gravimetric and volumetric
storage capacities are the metrics of interest. Figure 6 shows the excess adsorption, gravimetric
storage capacity, and volumetric storage capacity as a function of
porosity for two different models. The first model treats the porosity
and the specific surface as two independent variables, while the second
model treats them as dependent ones. The first model shows that the
excess adsorption is independent of the porosity; the gravimetric
storage capacity increases by increasing porosity, while the volumetric
storage capacity decreases by increasing porosity. By treating the
porosity and surface area as two dependent variables, the gravimetric
excess adsorption and the gravimetric storage capacities increase
by increasing porosity. However, the volumetric storage capacity reaches
a maximum of 101 g/L at ϕ = 0.73. This is consistent with experimental
results, showing that high specific surface area does not directly
reflect on the volumetric storage capacity since a high surface area
comes with a high porosity.15,16 Consequently, the maximum
theoretical volumetric storage capacity is 101 g/L at 35 bar and 298
K for activated carbon powder.

Figure 6 Relation between gravimetric and volumetric
storage capacities at 35 bar and 298 K, treating specific surface
area and porosities as two independent variables (top) and as two
dependent variables (bottom).

Figure 7 shows
the interdependency between gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities
for the two models. Experimental adsorption measurements are consistent
with the second model, treating porosity and surface area as dependent
variables. Table 3 shows
experimental excess adsorptions, gravimetric storage capacities, and
volumetric storage capacities of five activated carbon samples. Figure 6 (bottom) and Figure 7 (bottom) compare
the theoretical model with the experimental data. It shows that the
developed model is universal and predicts the interdependency between
gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities for any activated carbon
sample. The results are also applicable for metal organic frameworks.
Optimal activated carbon and MOFs (PCN-14 or NOT107, HKUST-1, and
Ni-MOF-74) do not have the highest surface area but an optimal porosity
between 0.65 and 0.75.16,30,31 Higher volumetric storage capacities are achieved by compressing
the activated carbon powder into monolith using a chemical binder.
The volumetric storage capacity for monolith is calculated using the
bulk monolith density instead of the apparent density in the case
of activated carbon or the single-crystal density in the case of MOFs.

3 Conclusions
In this article, we presented a model of microporosity that takes
the degree of activation in activated carbon into account. The interdependency
between porosity and specific surface area has been studied by combining
high-resolution STEM and subcritical nitrogen adsorption. This model
predicts the relation between the volumetric storage capacity and
the gravimetric storage capacity of supercritical methane at room
temperature. In addition, this model shows that the maximum theoretical
volumetric storage capacity is 101 g/L at 35 bar and 298 K for powder
activated carbon corresponding to a porosity of 0.73.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
O’Grady
and Wennerberg first patented chemical activation by potassium hydroxide
(KOH) in 1978.32 Activation by KOH is a
complicated process and consists of several consecutive and simultaneous
chemical reactions. The mechanism works for a variety of precursors
such as wood, anthracite, and petroleum coke. The completely activated
carbon sample “3 K” is prepared from corncob biomass
waste feedstock in a multistep process consisting of phosphoric acid
activation at 480 °C, followed by potassium hydroxide activation
at 800 °C in a nitrogen environment. The partially activated
carbon “HS;0B” is synthesized by the pyrolysis of poly(vinylidene
chloride). Further details of the synthesis and characterization of
these materials are provided by Romanos and Olsen.33−35

4.2 Structural Characterization
4.2.1 Subcritical
Nitrogen Adsorption
Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured
on an Autosorb instrument (Quantachrome). The total pore volume (Vtot) is measured at a pressure of 0.995 P/P0, while the specific surface
area ∑ is measured using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) theory in the pressure range of 0.01–0.03 P/P0, which is suitable for nanoporous
activated carbon. The intragranular porosity is calculated as follows 8  where ρskel = 2.23 g/cm3 is the theoretical skeletal density calculated using eq 6. The porosity ϕ is calculated
from the total pore volume (Vtot) using eq 1. 9  The apparent
density ρapp is determined using eq 2. Quenched solid density functional
theory (QSDFT) is used to calculate pore size distributions (PSDs).
A detailed description of QSDFT has been published in a previous study.35

4.2.2 Scanning Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Scanning transmission electron microscopy
was performed on a Nion UltraSTEM 100 with a third-generation C3/C5
aberration correction. 60 keV was used to avoid beam damage on carbon.
Samples were prepared by dispersing activated carbon grains in methanol
and depositing it on holey carbon support films.

4.3 Sievert Apparatus
The performance of a sorbent material
is assessed by measuring an excess adsorption isotherm and converting
it into volumetric and gravimetric storage capacities. Excess adsorption  is measured at 35 bar
and room temperature using a custom-built Sievert apparatus described
extensively in literature.36−38 The total gravimetric storage
capacity  is calculated from the excess
adsorption using the porosity of the sample, which is determined from eq 1. 10  The volumetric storage capacity  is determined by multiplying the
apparent density by the gravimetric storage capacity. 11  The apparent intragranular density is used
to calculate methane storage capacities. The void among activated
carbon particles is not taken into account. Consequently, the volumetric
and gravimetric storage capacities in this article represent the sorbent
performance and not the complete tank performance.
