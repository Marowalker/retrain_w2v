Atomistic simulations of three different proteins at
different
concentrations are performed to obtain insight into protein mobility
as a function of protein concentration. We report on simulations of
proteins from diluted to the physiological water concentration (about
70% of the mass). First, the viscosity was computed and found to increase
by a factor of 7–9 going from pure water to the highest protein
concentration, in excellent agreement with in vivo nuclear magnetic
resonance results. At a physiological concentration of proteins, the
translational diffusion is found to be slowed down to about 30% of
the in vitro values. The slow-down of diffusion found here using atomistic
models is slightly more than that of a hard sphere model that neglects
the electrostatic interactions. Interestingly, rotational diffusion
of proteins is slowed down somewhat more (by about 80–95% compared
to in vitro values) than translational diffusion, in line with experimental
findings and consistent with the increased viscosity. The finding
that rotation is retarded more than translation is attributed to solvent-separated
clustering. No direct interactions between the proteins are found,
and the clustering can likely be attributed to dispersion interactions
that are stronger between proteins than between protein and water.
Based on these simulations, we can also conclude that the internal
dynamics of the proteins in our study are affected only marginally
under crowding conditions, and the proteins become somewhat more stable
at higher concentrations. Simulations were performed using a force
field that was tuned for dealing with crowding conditions by strengthening
the protein–water interactions. This force field seems to lead
to a reproducible partial unfolding of an α-helix in one of
the proteins, an effect that was not observed in the unmodified force
field.

Introduction
The intracellular environment is densely
packed with macromolecules
like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars. The macromolecule concentration
in, for instance, Escherichia coli is
≈300–400 mg/mL,1 corresponding
to ≈40% of the intracellular volume.2,3 It
has been shown that a high concentration of macromolecules influences
the thermodynamics and kinetics of cellular processes.3−7 Most in vitro biochemical investigations are performed using dilute
solutions of up to 10 mg/mL. Despite this obvious difference, it is
commonly assumed, due to the lack of available data, that biochemical
quantities such as protein–ligand binding constants or enzymatic
reaction rates in vivo are comparable to the in vitro values. Under
in vivo conditions, steric effects and nonspecific interactions are
significant, however, and these constraints likely affect cellular
processes. Dynamics of biomolecules have been studied extensively
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments,8,9 and
this has led to models describing the internal protein dynamics as
a combination of intramolecular vibrations and overall tumbling.10 The typical rotational tumbling time for a small
protein of a few nanoseconds, which has emerged from NMR experiments,8,11 is not the same in a crowded environment.12 Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the diffusive properties
of proteins under conditions mimicking the interior of a cell is of
general interest for understanding cellular processes.

Diffusion
of macromolecules in the cytoplasm can be measured through
a variety of experimental techniques, including direct or indirect
optical techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS),13 single-particle tracking (SPT),14,15 fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP),16,17 or spectroscopic techniques such as pulse field gradient (PFG) NMR
via diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY).18 For example, the translational diffusion coefficient of green fluorescent
protein (GFP) in E. coli was measured
by FRAP to be reduced to 10% of the value in water.19,20

Theoretical models based on hard sphere (HS) models allow
investigation
of the steric effects on HS properties, due to increasing “macromolecular”
concentration.7 Such models explain the
excluded volume effect for simplified physical systems and can be
used to simulate diffusion-limited, reversible association reactions.21 Smooth hard spheres with only repulsive interactions
are likely not an accurate approximation of biomolecules, however,
since they do not capture effects, e.g., due to interactions between
cellular components or the role of water.22,23 More complex modeling studies have been applied to study the effects
of crowding,24,25 although these studies were still
performed without explicit water.

A number of full atomistic
simulations of proteins under crowding
conditions with explicit water have been published. Spiga et al. focused
on the effect of crowding by high concentrations of glucose on protein
dynamics and found significantly retarded protein dynamics and protein
dehydration.26 Yu and co-workers reported
on a model for a bacterial cytoplasm.27 From this work, they find that rotational as well as translational
diffusion decrease in a similar manner due to crowding. Water dynamics
in a crowded environment was addressed by the Feig group in multiple
studies. In one study, the structure of water around proteins was
investigated,28 while another focused on
water dynamics by studying proteins of different sizes.29 One further simulation study of Villin, a 36-residue
protein, under crowding conditions, showed that protein–protein
interactions led to protein rotational motion being retarded more
than translational motion.30 von Bülow
and co-workers have presented large simulations of concentrated protein
solutions to analyze dynamic properties.31 The findings from these papers will be discussed below.

An
issue that has recently come to the light is that traditional
additive force fields are not well suited to study proteins at high
concentrations30,32,33 or disordered proteins.34,35 Three solutions to
these problems have been proposed: to strengthen the interaction between
proteins and water by selectively strengthening the Lennard-Jones
(LJ) interactions,36 to strengthen the
water–water dispersion interaction34 or to weaken the Lennard-Jones interaction between the protein atoms.37,38 Best et al. proposed to replace the water model to use in conjunction
with the changed LJ interactions in the modified Amber force fields36 to TIP4P/200539 because
the standard TIP3P model40 is known to
have too fast kinetics.41 To validate this
combination of the protein force field (ffam-ws) and water model,
the free energy of hydration ΔGhyd of the amino acid side chains was evaluated alongside the diffusion
of amino acids in TIP4P/2005.42 It was
found that the ffam-ws + TIP4P/2005 combination is a good compromise
that predicts ΔGhyd as well as diffusion
constants reasonably well, but not perfectly.42 Nevertheless, we adopted this combination of models for the work
here, after we evaluated it against reducing dispersion coefficient
within proteins and organic liquids.38 A
further route was taken by von Bülow et al., who used a recent
Amber99 variant (Amber99SB*-ILDN-Q43−46) in combination with the dispersion-corrected
TIP4P water model.34 As a side note, we
would like to stress that evaluating force field predictive power
using protein simulations is likely less efficient than using organic
liquids.37,47−49

Using state-of-the-art
computers and efficient simulation software,50,51 we report here on simulations in atomistic detail to evaluate biomolecular
properties in conditions reminiscent of a physiological concentration.
Systematic studies of three proteins are presented at increasing protein
concentration and in three replicates. Mobility of biomolecules and
water is analyzed as a function of protein volume fraction and related
to the viscosity of the systems. The results are rationalized in terms
of overall and internal motion.10

Methods
Molecular Dynamics (MD) Setup
Three proteins were chosen
(Figure 1) for which
experimental rotational data are available from in vitro experiments,
ubiquitin52 (76 amino acids, total charge
0), 2k5753 (55 amino acids, total charge
−3 e), and 2kim54 (102 amino acids, total charge +7 e). The proteins
were simulated (using three replicas) at four different concentrations
using either 1, 2, 4, or 8 proteins in the same cubic box, which was
then filled with water. For ubiquitin, a further three simulations
were performed with 64 proteins at the same concentration as the eight-protein
simulation. The highest protein concentration corresponds to a water
mass fraction of less than 75%. An ionic strength of 0.15 M was obtained
by adding Na+ and anion Cl– to each box
(Table 1).

a SOL refers to the number of waters

For all simulations, the Amber99SB-ws force field
was used36 in combination with the TIP4P/2005
water model.39 Electrostatic interactions
were treated using
the particle mesh Ewald algorithm55 and
Lennard-Jones interactions with a cut-off of 1 nm. All covalent bonds
were constrained at their equilibrium length using the LINCS algorithm,56 allowing an integration time step of 2 fs. The
temperature was controlled at 310 K using the v-rescale algorithm57 and a coupling time of 0.5 ps. The pressure
was controlled at 1 bar using the Parrinello–Rahman algorithm58 with a time constant of 10 ps. Thirty-nine simulations
of 1 μs each were performed on parallel computers using the
GROMACS software.50,51

Hard Sphere Conformational Sampling
Conformations of
nonoverlapping “ubiquitin-like” hard spheres (HSs) were
generated for N = 2, 4, or 8 particles. Two radii
of gyration Rg = 1.2 and 1 nm were used
as the sphere size, the average sizes of the simulation boxes were
7.96, 7.94, and 7.91 nm (box edge, respectively). Then, random coordinates
for N HS particles were generated in cubic periodic
boxes with the edge indicated. This was done 100 000 times
to generate a reasonably sized sample. Distance analysis was performed
as described below for the MD simulations.

Translational Diffusion Coefficient
A mean square displacement
(MSD) analysis was performed to calculate the translational diffusion
coefficient.59 The diffusion coefficients
were extracted by a linear fit to the MSD by averaging blocks with
a length of 100 ns. Errors in the diffusion coefficients were estimated
by bootstrapping. The diffusion coefficient needs to be corrected
for finite-size effects60 through eq 1 1  where η is the viscosity, kB = 1.38 × 10–23 m2 kg/(s2 K), T = 310 K, and L =
7, 8, 9 × 10–9 m, respectively, for 2k57, ubiquitin,
and 2kim. Here, the shear viscosity is derived for each simulation
through the Einstein relation59,61 2  where V is the volume of
the simulation box and Pαβ is the off-diagonal components of the pressure. Statistics is improved
by taking the average over all six off-diagonal pressure tensor components.

Rotational Correlation Time and Internal Dynamics
To
estimate the rotational correlation time (global tumbling), each trajectory
of a protein was fitted rotationally and translationally to the initial
structure. From these trajectories, the autocorrelation functions Ci(t) were
calculated for all backbone amide (NH) vectors ri using 3  where P2 is the
second-order Legendre polynomial, P2(x) = (1/2)(3x2 – 1). Subsequently,
the order parameter (S2) and the internal
correlation time (τe) were derived by fitting to
the function10 4  for each NH vector ri. These two values (Si2, τei) were averaged
over all NH vectors to obtain ⟨S2⟩ and ⟨τe⟩, and these were
used in turn as the initial guess for calculating the overall tumbling
time τM by fitting the averaged correlation function 5  to the autocorrelation function of the original
trajectory averaged over the whole protein. This decomposition assumes
that the overall tumbling is isotropic, which need not be the case;
however, this assumption is applied commonly.10,62 The estimated overall tumbling time τM together
with order parameters Si2 and internal correlation
times τei obtained initially
were then used to minimize χ2 defined as 6  with respect to the 2N +
1 parameters Si2, τei, and τM. The tumbling time that is
proportional to the rotational diffusion coefficient through Drot = 1/6τM needs to be corrected
for finite-size effects63 through eq 7 7  

Results
Protein Stability
The mean square fluctuation of the
proteins was analyzed at the residue level to see the effect of crowding
on the stability of proteins (Figure 2). In the case of 2k57 and ubiquitin, the structures
of proteins are intact and also the internal dynamics of proteins
are not affected by crowding (Figure 2A,2B). However, for 2kim, the
region from residue 30 to 50, containing a loop and an α-helix, unfolds to some extent in the simulations at a low protein
concentration (Figure 2C). Upon comparing the simulation of 2kim using the amber99sb-ws
force field with a simulation using the standard Amber ff99SB-ILDN
force field,43,45,64 we note that no unfolding occurs with the original force field (Figure 2C,D) as visualized
in Figure 3. This may
indicate that the water–protein interactions were strengthened
too much in the ffam-ws force field.36 This
notion is consistent with the finding that there is less unfolding
as the water concentration decreases (Figure 2C).

field (green-red)
and the amber99sb-ws force field (cyan and yellow). The unfolding
region, residue 30–50, is highlighted in red and yellow, respectively.

Internal Protein Dynamics
The internal dynamics of
the proteins was analyzed based on the motions of the backbone NH
vectors using the Lipari and Szabo analysis10 (eq 4). Figure 4 shows the average order parameters S2 for the three proteins as a function of concentration.
In conjunction with this, Figure 5 shows the internal relaxation times τe. The plots show the typical shape where residues in loop regions
are more flexible with low S2 (Figure 4) and high τe (Figure 5)
than those in stable secondary structure elements. For ubiquitin,
the region around residue 50 is more labile at low protein concentration
than at high protein concentration (Figures 4B and 5B), this is,
however, not apparent in the root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs)
(Figure 2B) that are
low at all ubiquitin concentrations. The same region, around residue
30–50, in 2kim that showed large RMSF (Figure 2C) also has low order parameters (Figure 4C) and slow internal
tumbling (Figure 5C).

Overall Mobility
The shear viscosity η, the average
translational diffusion constants DP for
the proteins, and the overall tumbling times τM for
each system are tabulated in Table 2. The viscosity in the single protein simulations,
at low concentrations, is very similar as expected, at around 1.3
× 10–3 kg/(m s). For reference, the viscosity
for TIP4P/2005 has been estimated to be 0.855 × 10–3 kg/(m s),65 and the addition of protein
and salt increases the viscosity rather drastically to about a factor
of 7–9 going from pure water to physiological protein concentration
(Table 2). The viscosity
is notoriously difficult to compute because the pressure fluctuations
converge slowly.61 As a result, the computed
η for two ubiquitins and for two or four 2kim proteins are too
low despite averaging over three replicas of 1 μs. This has
an impact on the protein diffusion constants for these systems through eq 1 (Table 2), but the trends in Figure 6A are clear anyway.

for finite size effect according to eq 1. Experimental in vitro measurements of the global
tumbling times are shown in the first column for comparison.53

To be able to compare the dynamics for different proteins,
translational
diffusion constants DP were normalized
to be one at infinite dilution. DP/DP,0 is displayed as a function of protein volume
fraction in Figure 6B. At a biomolecular mass fraction of more than 20%, the diffusion
coefficient is reduced to 25–38% of dilute conditions (25%
for 2k57, 38% for ubiquitin, and 35% for 2kim). For comparison, the
gray line in Figure 6B shows the estimated decline in the diffusion coefficient for hard
spheres (HSs) modeled according to the Enskog theory66 8  where ϕ is the protein
volume fraction.

The average rotational tumbling times τM/τM0 and corresponding uncertainties
were obtained
from all of the proteins in each simulation and are displayed as a
function of biomolecular mass fraction in Figure 6C. At the highest concentration, we find
that the global tumbling time τM increases by a factor
of 21.9 ± 4.1 for 2k57, 11.5 ± 3.4 for ubiquitin, and 6.6
± 1.5 for 2kim. We note that the spread in the results, which
is different from the protein translational diffusion, is compatible
with NMR experiments.67 Mean square displacement
plots of simulations of 2, 4, 8, and 64 ubiquitins are provided in
the Supporting Information. Simulations
of 8 and 64 proteins have the same protein concentration, and the
fact that the results of both simulations are similar shows that the
size of the systems is sufficient.

Water Diffusion
The water diffusion coefficient DW is reduced by about 40% as the protein volume
fraction increases to that corresponding to physiological conditions
(Figure 6D). The HS
model overestimates the reduction of the diffusion coefficient for
water under crowding conditions slightly.

Protein–Protein and Protein–Water Interactions
Protein–protein hydrogen bonds were counted in all simulations
with more than one protein, to test for clustering (Table 3). A geometric criterion was
used where a hydrogen bond was counted when the donor–acceptor
distance was less than or equal to 0.35 nm, and the hydrogen-donor–acceptor
angle was less than or equal to 30°.68,69 In none of the cases is the number of hydrogen bonds larger than
1 on average, indicating that direct protein–protein interactions
are infrequent and transient only.

Intramolecular hydrogen bonds were evaluated using
the same criterion
to investigate concentration dependence (Table 4). 2k57 and ubiquitin have a number of hydrogen
bonds that do not depend on the concentration and has a low standard
deviation, indicating a stable secondary structure. For 2kim, the
numbers fluctuate significantly, and despite high standard deviation,
there are three to four fewer hydrogen bonds in the single protein
simulations than in the simulations at higher concentrations.

The number of protein–water hydrogen bonds
was determined
per protein as well (Table 5). For 2k57 and ubiquitin, the numbers are almost identical
at all concentrations. For ubiquitin, there is a slight drop in the
number of hydrogen bonds with concentration only, but for 2kim, the
picture is more complex. Although there are no intermolecular protein–protein
interactions (Table 3), the number of protein–water hydrogen bonds varies more
for 2kim than for the other proteins due to again the partial unfolding
that is also shown in Figures 2C and 3. The high number of protein–water
hydrogen bonds in single-molecule 2kim simulations coincides with
a reduced number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Table 4).

Radial distribution functions (RDFs) are provided
in Figures S6–S8. The plots give
center-of-mass
distance RDFs for simulations of two and eight proteins. Except for
one simulation of two proteins of 2kim (Figure S8), the probability of finding proteins close to each other
is larger at the highest concentration (eight proteins) than at the
lower concentration (two proteins), which is logical from the perspective
of reduced volume available to the proteins at higher concentrations.

Distance Analysis
We analyzed distances between protein
heavy atom at different concentrations for different cut-off distances
equal to 0.27, 0.57, and 0.87 nm in the same manner as Nawrocki et
al.70 We considered distances at 0.27 nm
to correspond to direct interactions and 0.57 and 0.87 nm for the
first and second hydration layers, respectively. Increasing the cut-off
leads to a significantly larger fraction of clustered proteins. A
comparison with a ubiquitin-like hard sphere model (Figure 7) shows that the clustering
cannot be explained by excluded volume as the largest clusters in
the MD simulation are populated to much larger fractions than the
HS model. We note that the radius used for the hard spheres was taken
somewhat ad hoc as the radius of gyration. Using a smaller radius,
corresponding to a lower concentration, leads to smaller and fewer
protein clusters (Figure 7). The analysis at the shortest distance, 0.27 nm, corresponds
to a strong hydrogen bond or salt-bridge. Apparently, this underestimated
the clustering significantly, and therefore the hydrogen bonding analysis
(Table 3) is not sufficient
to draw conclusion about clustering behavior. Rather than direct interactions,
long-range dispersion interactions between the proteins38,71 or simply the hydrophobic effect72 may
influence the clustering. Figures S17–S19 show that the clustering occurs rapidly during the time of simulations
and is reproducible in the three replicas of the protein simulations.

2kim, at three different concentrations for three different distances.
In addition, a similar analysis of a ubiquitin-like hard sphere (HS-ub1.2 and HS-ub1, see Methods) was performed. Colors indicate the distance criterion used. Blue:
0.27 nm, red: 0.57 nm, and green: 0.87 nm.

Discussion
It has been stated that water determines
the structure and dynamics
of proteins.22 However, this picture is
biased by the fact that most biochemical experiments are performed
under dilute conditions.20 Protein properties
depend on their environment, for instance, through electrostatic interactions
with other constituents of that environment73,74 and the charge distribution on biomolecular surfaces has been suggested
to affect macromolecular dynamics.67 Macromolecular
crowding has also been reported to alter the translational and rotational
diffusion of biomolecules in experimental studies.12,75,76 In this work, we employed molecular dynamics
simulations to study proteins at high concentrations to mimic crowding
effects. It is well established that MD simulations allow us to probe
protein–water interactions in spatial and temporal details
(see e.g., ref (77)). Furthermore, MD simulations allow us to analyze the internal dynamics78 as well as the diffusive properties of proteins62,79 in comparison with, in particular, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
experiments. The choice of proteins was guided here by the availability
of the experimental data for protein tumbling.

Simulations of
highly concentrated systems with conventional force
fields have been reported to lead to unphysical aggregation of biomolecules
due to strong protein–protein interactions.32,33 Here, we used the force field by Best et al.36 that has been tuned for simulations of high concentrations
of macromolecules, by strengthening the protein–water Lennard-Jones
interactions. The force field is used in conjunction with the TIP4P/2005
water model39 to obtain better kinetic
properties. The combination was validated in two additional papers,
one on hydration free energy of amino acids and diffusion of amino
acids42 and one comparing the Best et al.
force field36 to other approached for shifting
the relative strength of interactions toward stronger protein–water
interactions.38 As noted in the introduction,
alternative combinations of water models and protein force fields
have been applied as well.28,31

1ubq (76 AA), and 2kim (102 AA), are found here to be 6 times slower
for 2k57, 3.1 times slower for ubiquitin, and 3.0 times slower for
2kim at a physiologically relevant protein volume fraction compared
to the dilute conditions (Figure 6B). In other words, the slow-down of translational
diffusion is more than the factor of two reported for the mini-protein
Villin by Nawrocki et al.30 We do find
a slow-down of rotational tumbling (Figure 6C) comparable to that reported by Nawrocki
et al. for Villin.30 Protein concentration
is an important factor and our simulations were performed at a somewhat
higher concentration than those by Nawrocki30 or von Bülow,31 and therefore
we find stronger retardation of mobility. Experimentally, a range
of 4–17 times slow-down of translational diffusion has been
reported.17,19,20,80,81 The fact that our simulation
results are at the lower end of that range could be because there
are only weak protein–protein interactions in our simulations
(Figure 7). The clustering
observed may explain that the rotational tumbling is retarded more
than translational diffusion because direct interactions will hinder
rotational motion. A cellular environment is crowded by molecules
in a wide range of sizes and charge distributions, and transient interactions
between cellular components could affect diffusional properties,76 in line with the result on the Villin protein.30 The slow-down in diffusion found in this work
is correlated to the increase in viscosity (Figure 6A), although it is known that the Stokes–Einstein
relation between diffusion and viscosity holds approximately only82,83 since the particle size that enters the equation is not an exact
quantity. However, recent work by von Bülow suggests that the
Stokes–Einstein relation may be applied to proteins in solution
as well.31

The rotational diffusion
slow-down for the different proteins (Figure 6C) has a large spread,
a factor of 22 for 2k57, 11 for ubiquitin, and 7 for 2kim. These results
are compatible with the NMR data that show that translational- and
rotational diffusion may or may not be coupled, depending on the protein.67 For 2k57, the large increase in τM (Figure 6C
and Table 2) can likely
not be explained by the somewhat reduced hydration (Table 5), as was noted for protein
mobility in a crowded glucose solution,26 but rather by weak interactions as discussed above. It has been
noted before that the hydration properties may differ between proteins
of different sizes, leading to different diffusion properties.28,84 Harada et al. suggest a relationship between protein–water
interactions and viscosity, based on the Stokes–Einstein equation.28 Our results suggest that the increase of viscosity
with protein concentration is very similar to the three proteins studied
here (Figure 6A). Indeed,
the increase of the viscosity by a factor of 7–9 is very similar
to the factor of 8 reported from in vivo experiments.76 This suggests that the slow-down in rotation has another
cause, e.g., the charge distribution on the surface67 or weak dispersion interactions. We find that the rotational
diffusion of the proteins in our study seems to be size-dependent,
unlike the translational diffusion and viscosity (Figure 6A–C). At the highest
concentration of proteins, small proteins are slowed down more than
big proteins for an unknown reason. The effect of protein–protein
interactions on translational and rotational diffusion has previously
been investigated by the addition of high concentrations of either
synthetic polymers or protein crowders to dilute protein solutions
as an attempt to mimic the cellular environment.12 These results showed that synthetic polymers led to translational
diffusion being retarded more than rotational diffusion. However,
using protein crowders or cell lysate, the rotational diffusion was
retarded more than translational diffusion,12 these results seem to agree with the findings in this work (Figure 6B6,C).

The differences between our simulations and the
HS model predictions
for diffusion are small for both proteins (Figure 6B) and water (Figure 6D). The reasonable correspondence between
full atomistic MD and HS models suggests that the excluded volume
explains the drop in diffusion to some extent;24 however, interactions are important as well (Figure 7). Indeed, Brownian dynamics
simulations, where only steric effects are taken into account, form
a simple tool to test Enskog predictions for the effects of crowding.
It has been shown that the diffusion of simple hard sphere molecules
slows down as a function of molecular volume occupation in agreement
with Enskog theory.85 Hard sphere Brownian
dynamics simulation coupled with hydrodynamic interactions can in
principle be tuned to give a good estimate on slow-down of translational
diffusion as a function of crowding;24,86 however, these
techniques cannot give insight into the role of explicit waters or
into the rotational mobility of biomolecules.

McGuffee and Elcock
studied the effects of crowding in a cytoplasmic
model system of E. coli containing
the 50 most abundant proteins, but without explicit water.25 Steric forces with and without electrostatic
interactions cause different dynamics as shown by the difference in
the diffusion coefficient of GFP as one of the constituents of their
model, however, the GFP diffusion coefficient predicted by that model25 was still not correct when compared to measurements.17,19,20 The addition of an intramolecular
interaction by Lennard-Jones potential was used to obtain a correct
diffusion coefficient of GFP,25 however,
for this, the Lennard-Jones parameter had to be exaggerated since
the role of water was neglected.87 Skolnick
highlights in a review88 the importance
of hydrodynamic interactions for understanding biomolecular mobility
under crowding conditions. However, these models predict, for instance,
that the decay of translational diffusion is size-dependent, something
that seems to be at odds with our findings (Figure 6B) although the range of protein sizes studied
here is limited and crowders of different sizes and chemical composition
can have different effects. It should be noted that, in general, hydrodynamic
interactions need to be considered only when no explicit solvent is
present.86

It has been shown that
proteins become more stable under crowding
conditions effectuated through inert synthetic polymers, where only
the steric effects are important.89−92 However, when doing the measurement
in a cellular-like environment, it was found that electrostatic interactions
destabilize protein structures when opposite charges on the surface
attract each other.93 In some cases, electrostatic
interactions may stabilize the structures due to repulsive forces.5,94,95 These findings emphasize that
the effect of direct intermolecular interactions on stability is not
negligible. Few intermolecular protein–protein hydrogen bonds
were found in this study (Table 3), but solvent-separated interactions are important
(Figure 7), and there
is an effect of protein concentration on protein stability (Figure 2). It cannot be excluded
that due to the force field used for this study, the solute–solvent
interactions are strengthened so much that the proteins have the tendency
to bind to water more than to the other proteins and, as a result,
it seems that the region containing a loop and α-helix (residue
30–50) of the 2kim protein is destabilized (Figure 2C). This behavior was not observed
when the original Amber ff99SB-ILDN was used (Figures 2D and 3). Interestingly,
the stability increases when the protein concentration goes up for
both 2kim (Figure 2C) and ubiquitin (Figure 4B), in line with the experimental studies mentioned.89−92

Without a doubt, the relationship between protein stability
and
the environment or protein dynamics and the environment is very complex.28,31,70 Although MD simulations are ideally
suited to study large and complex systems of biomolecules, be it virus
particles96−99 or crowding effects27,28 in atomistic detail, it will
take considerable effort to tune force fields to become completely
transferable between different chemical environments.100,101 It may be necessary to consider long-range dispersion interactions
explicitly37,38,55,102 or to include higher-order terms of the
London dispersion forces to obtain more accurate simulations.103 However, to study the effect of crowding without
altering the van der Waals parameters, using a model with higher-order
dispersion coefficients103 or a polarizable
force field104,105 might give results closer to
experimental values, even though conventional force field improvement
is still on-going as well.106
