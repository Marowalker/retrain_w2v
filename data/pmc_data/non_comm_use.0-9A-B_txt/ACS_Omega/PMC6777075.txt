Herein,
we report the cooperative effect of Zr doping and vacuum
annealing on the carrier dynamics and interfacial kinetics of anodized
TiO2 nanotubes for light-driven water oxidation. After
evaluation of different Zr loads and different annealing conditions,
it was found that both Zr doping and vacuum annealing lead to a significantly
enhanced light harvesting efficiency and photoelectrochemical performance.
The substitution of Zr4+ by Ti4+ species leads
to a higher density of surface defects such as oxygen vacancies, facilitating
electron trapping on Zr4+, which reduced the charge recombination
and hence boosted the charge transfer kinetics. More importantly,
vacuum annealing promoted the presence of surface defects. Furthermore,
the mechanistic study through impedance spectroscopy revealed that
both charge transfer and surface conductivity are significantly enhanced
due the presence of an oxygen-deficient TiO2 surface. These
results represent an important step forward in the optimization of
nanostructured TiO2-based photoelectrodes, with high potential
in photocatalytic applications, including solar fuel production.

Introduction
One-dimensional nanostructures
have attracted significant interest
in the last years as advanced platforms for energy conversion and
storage,1,2 catalysis,3 and
sensing.4 The ordered material architecture
offers multiple advantages in terms of (i) unidirectional transport
pathways uninterrupted by interparticle connections, (ii) the possibility
to form surface electrical fields able to reduce recombination by
confining the injected electrons to the central zone of the tubes,
and (iii) improved penetration of the liquid/gas into the pores compared
to disordered architectures, which is beneficial for photoelectrochemical
and catalytic applications.5 Furthermore,
the size reduction to the nanometer scale leads to a higher surface-to-volume
ratio, which can be beneficial for applications involving surfaces
as catalytic and (photo)electrochemical applications.6

Several metal-oxide nanowire and nanotube architectures
deposited
on a conducting substrate for different applications have been reported,
with most studies focusing on titanium dioxide (TiO2) not
only for its promising functional properties but also as a relevant
model for mechanistic studies.7−9 Consequently, several strategies
have been explored to enhance the optoelectronic properties of TiO2 (e.g., light harvesting, conductivity, charge transfer kinetics,
recombination kinetics) aiming at boosting its performance for a particular
application. For example, doping with C, N, and S atoms has showed
enhanced optical absorption of TiO2 by decreasing the band
gap.4,10,11 Heat treatment
under reductive conditions (vacuum or H2) has been reported
as a successful method to increase the donor density concentration
of TiO2 through the introduction of a high density of oxygen
vacancies, serving as electron donors.4,11 Mechanistic
studies have shown that the improved electrical properties of oxygen-deficient
TiO2 synthesized under reducing conditions are related
to the effective suppression of carrier recombination coupled to enhanced
charge separation.12 Consistently, bulk
and surface conductivities in TiO2 nanotubes significantly
increase due to the presence of oxygen-deficient TiO2 nanolayers.13 Indeed, hydrogenated TiO2 also called
black titania has resulted in a highly successful strategy to extend
the optical absorption of this material to near infrared, significantly
enhancing its optoelectronic and catalytic properties.14,15

On the other hand, homovalent doping of TiO2 with
Zr
also yields enhanced performance, as widely documented in the literature.
It was found that Zr incorporation into TiO2 layers improved
the performance in hybrid perovskite solar cells leading to longer
carrier lifetimes and higher charge carrier densities, which have
been ascribed to reduced defect sites in the bulk or at the interfaces
of the perovskite.16 Similar surface passivation
effects on TiO2 have been attributed to ZrO2 nanolayers, in high-efficiency organic17 and dye-sensitized solid-state photovoltaic devices.6 ZrO2 coatings on TiO2 also enhance
optical scattering, which is beneficial for light harvesting increasing
the optical pathway.18

In the present
study, we report the combined effect of Zr incorporation
and vacuum annealing on the photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 nanotubes for light-driven water oxidation. We have found
that both Zr addition and vacuum annealing lead to the creation of
surface oxygen vacancies, which produce optical scattering and consequently
slightly enhanced light harvesting efficiency and more relevantly
induce surface stress and an anodic band shift, both beneficial effects
for enhanced photo-electrocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanotubes toward water oxidation.

Results and Discussion
The combined effects of both Zr-doping and vacuum-annealing treatment
on the optical and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 nanotubes are shown in Figure 1. The onset wavelength at 400 nm observed in the absorbance
measurement in Figure 1a perfectly agrees with the direct band gap of anatase TiO2. It is worthy to note that both vacuum annealing and Zr addition
produce a higher sub-band gap absorbance signal (at wavelengths >400
nm). We have ascribed this signal to optical scattering, as previously
reported for ZrO2-decorated TiO2 nanoparticles.19 The precise values of the band gap were determined
from the Tauc plots for direct optical transitions, as shown in Figure S1. The measured photocurrents, which
we ascribe to oxygen evolution,20,21 are significantly higher
upon Zr doping in both vacuum and air atmosphere. Additionally, the
highest performance is obtained under vacuum annealing conditions
(Figure 1b). The spectral
signature of the photocurrent was determined by incident photon to
current efficiency (IPCE), as shown in Figure 1c. Furthermore, the integrated photocurrents,
shown in Table S1, are consistent with
those reported in Figure 1b at 1.23 V versus RHE. The stability of the different photoelectrodes
was assessed by chronoamperometric experiments at 1.23 VRHE , as depicted in Figure 1d. The measurements show stable photocurrents (for 100 min)
of around 0.7 mA cm–2 for vacuum-annealed samples
and 0.45 mA cm–2 for air-annealed samples. Note
that the anodic transients observed in the air-annealed samples after
switching the light on are suppressed for the vacuum-annealed ones,
suggesting a significant reduction of surface recombination.

also shown for comparison), and (c) incident photon to current efficiency
(IPCE) and (d) chronoamperiometric tests at 1.23 V vs RHE to evaluate
the stability of the electrodes.

In order to explain the origin of the increased performance after
optimal Zr doping and annealing under vacuum conditions, a detailed
optical, morphological, and structural characterization was carried
out. First, the optimized Zr content on the TiO2 nanotubes
was determined after testing different Zr loads by varying the total
applied charge during the cathodic electrodeposition process (see
the Experimental Section for the detailed
procedure). The results are summarized in Figure S2a, finding that the optimized electrodeposited charge corresponds
to 2 mC. Consequently, throughout the rest of the manuscript, unless
otherwise specified, the optimized Zr-doped TiO2 nanotube
photoelectrodes are labeled as Zr:TiO2 NTs. Upon different
Zr additions, the highest sub-band gap absorbance (mainly related
to optical scattering) takes place for the optimized electrodeposited
charge (Supporting Information, Figure S2b), which is beneficial for light harvesting due to the enhanced optical
path in the nanotube film. This effect can partially account for the
slight increase in the absorbance in the 300–400 nm region
and the photocurrent and IPCEs shown in Figure 1c.

Figure 2 summarizes
the morphological analysis of the TiO2 nanotubes with and
without the optimal Zr addition for the two different thermal treatments
(air and vacuum). The characteristic parameters of the different nanotubes
are 150 nm tube diameter, 20 nm wall thickness, and around 1 μm
tube length. The surface density estimated by image analysis was ∼150
tubes/μm2. In all cases, the composition determined
by EDS analysis perfectly agrees with stoichiometric TiO2 (Supporting Information, Figure S3 and Table S2). The amount of Zr present in the samples is under the detection
limit of the EDS technique, and no Zr could be identified in any of
the tested Zr:TiO2 NT samples with this technique. It is
noted that practically identical microstructures are obtained for
the different thermal treatments, and consequently, the different
observed photocurrents in Figure 1b are not related to morphological differences between
the tested samples.

different thermal treatments under (a) air and (b) vacuum and with

tubular morphology from a representative region of the vacuum-annealed
Zr:TiO2 NTs.

The crystalline structure
of the materials was determined by XRD
(Supporting Information, Figure S4 and Table S3). All tested TiO2 samples heat-treated in the two different
atmospheres (air and vacuum) and independently of the Zr addition
exhibited the pure anatase phase (JCPDS card no. 21-1272) without
any trace of secondary phases. The diffraction peak associated with
the (101) planes is dominant in both undoped and Zr-doped samples,
as reported for other titania nanotubes.22 Note that, due to the small amount of Zr, the observation of peak
shifts or broadening effects in the XRD diffractograms is not straightforward.
On the other hand, higher-resolution structural information was obtained
with TEM analysis. Again, independent of the Zr addition or the atmosphere
during the heat treatment, the nanotubes presented a very similar
structure (Supporting Information, Figure S5a). Representative selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns
shown in Figure S5b clearly evidenced that,
in all cases, the hkl interplanar distances corresponded
to pure anatase,23 in good agreement with
the XRD results. Consistently, EDS analyses carried out in the TEM
chamber confirmed the stoichiometry of the samples as TiO2 (Supporting Information, Figure S6).

The negligible microstructural differences between bare and treated
TiO2 nanotubes cannot account for the remarkable differences
in performance observed in Figure 1. This suggests that the effect of both heat treatment
atmosphere and Zr doping should be confined to the surface of the
nanotubes. Consequently, a detailed surface characterization of the
TiO2 nanotubes in all tested conditions was carried out
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Figure 3 and Table S4. The survey spectrum reveals the presence of Ti, O, and
Zr. The shoulder located at 429 eV, inside the complex band associated
with the O 1s orbital, confirms the presence of O–2 ions, bonded with Ti4+ or Zr4+ to form the
associated oxide compounds (Figure 3b,c). Indeed, it has been reported that immediate oxidation
of Zr to ZrO2 takes place when electrodeposited Zr from
DMSO solution is in contact with air.24 The peaks associated with Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, located at 464 and 458 eV, respectively, confirm the 4+ state of
Ti associated with TiO2, as shown in Figure 3d. The presence of Zr at the surface of the
doped samples is also evidenced by the presence of two peaks located
at 184 (Zr 3d3/2) and 181 eV (Zr 3d5/2) confirming
the 4+ state characteristic of ZrO2 (Figure 3e). The amount of Zr was estimated as ∼0.3
at. % for all the Zr:TiO2 analyzed samples, which is at
the detection limit of the XPS instrument.25 The fact that Zr was bonded to oxygen in the 4+ state clearly supports
the partial substitution of Ti4+ by Zr4+ ions.
Indeed, the surface substitution of Zr4+ by Ti4+ species is expected due to their similar ionic radii (0.72 and 0.61
Å, respectively).26,27 Some authors have reported that,
even if the ionic radius of Zr4+ is slightly higher than
that of Ti4+, Zr can still be easily accommodated into
the TiO2 crystalline lattice.28 To alleviate the strain induced by the size difference between the
two ions, the lattice oxygen, particularly surface oxygen, escapes
from the lattice and leads to the formation of a surface hole trap.
This effect has been reported to improve the photocatalytic performance
of TiO2 nanotubes,28 in good
agreement with the results of Figure 1b. Furthermore, the incorporation of a higher amount
of the substitutional dopant (Zr) can induce excessive strain in the
crystal lattice of the host, favoring the presence of structural defects,
which can also act as recombination centers.19 Then these structural defects induced by excessive strain explain
the observed decrease in performance upon increasing the loaded charge
of Zr beyond 2 mC on the TiO2 nanotubes (Supporting Information, Figure S2). On the other hand, compared to pristine
TiO2 samples, the higher density of surface defects with
Zr addition is consistent with the increased optical scattering shown
in Figure 1a. Indeed,
the effect of the optimal Zr doping favoring the creation of defects
in TiO2 has been reported to facilitate electron trapping
on Zr4+ rather than on Ti4+ leading to reduced
charge recombination and subsequently boosting charge transfer kinetics
and hence performance.19,29

and vacuum atmospheres. XPS results on O 1s orbital for Zr:TiO2 NTs under (b) air and (c) vacuum. XPS results on analyzed
samples corresponding to (d) Ti 2p and (e) Zr 3d orbitals.

Regarding the use of reductive atmospheres (vacuum annealing
in
the present study), an increase in the water splitting performance
for anatase TiO2 nanotubes has been already reported under
hydrogen annealing.11,12 This enhancement of performance
has been associated with the creation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ species that acts as electron donor species.11,30 Compared to air-annealed samples, a slight decrease in the oxygen
concentration was detected in the vacuum-annealed samples by XPS (Supporting
Information, Table S4). This decrease of
oxygen can be attributed to a higher concentration of oxygen-deficient-related
surface defects, which enhance the water oxidation performance (Figure 1b). Previous studies
demonstrate that oxygen vacancies are more likely formed at the surface,
rather than within the bulk of TiO2, as suggested by our
structural, electrical, and surface characterization, but these defects
are not so mobile as the Ti3+ species, which can migrate
via interstitial positions.31 The optical
scattering and improved absorbance observed in Figure 1a for vacuum-annealed samples are also in
good agreement with previous reports where the use of reductive atmospheres
leads to the presence of defects (O2– vacancies, F+ color centers, and Ti3+ species
are the most common defects in the (101) planes of TiO2), which can enhance light absorption.22

Further mechanistic insights were extracted from impedance
spectroscopy
measurements in the dark and under illumination on Zr:TiO2 NTs after thermal treatment in air or vacuum. The raw data were
fitted to an equivalent circuit classically used in nanostructured
TiO2 architectures where transport and charge transfer/recombination
are coupled (Supporting Information, Figure S7). The outcome of this fitting procedure led to the determination
of transport resistance Rtr (linked to
electron conductivity), charge transfer resistance Rct (related to water oxidation catalysis), and capacitance C (related to the charge storage mechanism). These values
as a function of the applied potential are presented in the Figure 4. The capacitances
show an anodic shift under vacuum annealing and Zr addition, which
can be related to hole accumulation at the photoelectrode surface.
Furthermore, the charge transfer resistance Rct (Figure 4b,e) shows lower values for the vacuum-annealed Zr:TiO2 NTs, indicating the enhanced water oxidation kinetics at the surface
of the electrode, consistent with the enhanced catalytic activity
of slightly stressed surface, due to the presence of surface defects.28 On the other hand, Rtr (Figure 4a,d) decreases
in the vacuum-annealed Zr:TiO2 NTs, supporting that surface
conductivity is significantly enhanced due to the presence of an oxygen-deficient
TiO2 surface, in good agreement with a previous report.24 From the obtained Rct and Rtr values, the diffusion length
was also calculated for the analyzed samples and for all the cases
was in the order of several tens of micrometers (Supporting Information, Figure S8). Hence, the carrier diffusion is not
limiting the performance of our TiO2 nanotubes for water
oxidation. Therefore, the main responsible factors for the enhanced
performance are enhanced kinetics, although surface transport is also
improved under the cooperative action of Zr addition and vacuum annealing.
It is worthy to note that the series resistance (Rs) related to the resistance of the substrate and the
contacts is systematically below 12 Ω in all cases due to the
high conductivity of the metallic Ti substrate (Supporting Information, Figure S9).

Figure 4 Fitted parameters from the EIS analysis
in the dark and under illumination:
(a–c) transport resistance (Rtr), charge transfer resistance (Rct),
and capacitance (C), respectively, in bare TiO2 NTs; (d–f) same in Zr:TiO2 NTs. The lines
are guides for the eye.

Moreover, at the tested
potentials, the photoelectrode is driven
to reverse polarization, and the obtained capacitance (Figure 4c,f) shows the classical Mott–Schottky
behavior (vide infra in Figure 5) reflecting a large donor density of the n-type TiO2 nanotubes (Supporting Information, Table S5).5 The flat band potential is anodically
shifted upon vacuum annealing (Figure 5), which is consistent with the anodic shift of the
photocurrent onset potential for the optimal combination in Figure 1b, due to the higher
thermodynamic driving force for water oxidation as result of the hole
accumulation at the photoelectrode surface, and nicely explains the
enhanced water oxidation performance as a result of the cooperative
effect of both vacuum annealing and optimal Zr addition. However,
in contrast to previous studies where the use of reductive atmospheres
led to increased donor density,4,11 this quantity does
not significantly change in all tested conditions (Supporting Information, Table S5), confirming that the increased density
of oxygen vacancies measured by XPS is not translated into the TiO2 bulk. The thickness of the space charge layer (w) was also calculated for all tested TiO2 nanotubes (Supporting
Information, Figure S10), and the obtained
results are in the range of 1 nm, validating that the above described
morphology can accommodate such a band bending. We note that a specific
Mott–Schottky equation for a tubular structure was not used
in the present study.32 However, the present
results can be qualitatively valid to explain the observed performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the cooperative effects of
Zr incorporation and vacuum annealing are related to enhanced surface
activity of the TiO2 nanotubes, which results in improved
water oxidation performance, although the quantitative contribution
of vacuum annealing is more important than Zr addition. Both doping
and vacuum annealing lead to a slightly stressed surface and consequently
to a catalytically more active TiO2 surface, concomitant
to the creation of surface defects (oxygen vacancies), which enhance
transport. Vacuum annealing produces an anodic band shift, highly
beneficial for the accumulation of surface holes needed for water
oxidation. Furthermore, Zr doping and vacuum annealing induce optical
scattering, enhancing the optical pathway of incoming light and slightly
increasing light harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 nanotube
films. These results contribute to the understanding and design of
efficient photo-electrochemical cells for solar fuel production.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of TiO2 Nanotube Electrodes
TiO2 NT arrays were synthesized by a two-step electrochemical
anodization of Ti foil at room temperature. First, a 0.25 mm thick
Ti foil (>99.5% purity, Alfa Aesar) was cleaned with acetone and
deionized
(DI) water in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. Then the foil was subjected
to potentiostatic anodization for 30 min in a two-electrode electrochemical
cell with Pt foil as the counter electrode. A constant voltage of
60 V was employed for the anodization, and the electrolyte used was
0.12 M NH4F (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 5:100 (w/w) mixture of
DI water and ethylene glycol (EG). The Ti foil was taken out and was
ultrasonically cleaned in DI water for few seconds for the next round
of potentiostatic anodization under identical conditions, but now,
the time was 3 h. The anodized Ti foil was rinsed with DI water several
times and annealed in air at 450 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate
of 2 °C min–1 to obtain crystalline TiO2 nanotubes on the Ti foil. Alternatively, TiO2 nanotubes
with different Zr additions were obtained by electrodeposition using
an electrodeposition bath composed of 5 mM zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate
(C20H28O8Zr, Sigma-Aldrich) in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). The electrodeposition was carried out in a three-electrode
cell consisting of a TiO2 nanotube (as anodized) working
electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference
electrode. Cathodic deposition was performed potentiostatically at
−2.0 V versus Ag/AgCl by varying the total deposited charge
(2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mC). The film was then heated at 450 °C
for 2 h in air (ramping rate = 2.0 °C min–1). The TiO2 NT arrays (bare and Zr-doped) were annealed
a second time under vacuum conditions or in an air atmosphere for
comparison.

Structural, Optical, and Photoelectrochemical
Characterization
Morphological and compositional characterization
of the electrodes
was studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
with a JSM-7000F JEOL FEG-SEM system (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with
an INCA 400 Oxford EDS analyzer (Oxford, U.K.) operating at 15 kV
and a JEM-2100 JEOL transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating
at 200 kV. Prior to the FE-SEM experiment, the samples were sputtered
with a 2 nm thick layer of Pt. X-ray diffraction spectra were recorded
using a Rigaku Miniflex 600, (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan speed of
3° min–1. Surface analysis was carried out
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Specs SAGE 150 instrument.
The analyses were performed using nonmonochrome Al Kα irradiation
(1486.6 eV) at 20 mA and 13 kV, a constant energy pass of 75 eV for
overall analysis, 30 eV for analysis in the specific binding energy
ranges of each element, and a measurement area of 1 × 1 mm2. The pressure in the analysis chamber was 8 × 10–9 hPa. The data were evaluated using CasaXPS software.
The energy corrections of the spectra were performed considering a
reference value of C 1s from the organic matter at 284.8 eV. Optical
properties of the prepared films were also determined through UV–vis
spectroscopy of the electrodes recorded with a Cary 300 Bio spectrometer.
The absorbance (A) was estimated from transmittance
(T) and diffuse reflectance (R)
measurements as A = – log (T + R). The direct optical band gap was estimated
by the Tauc plot as , where n = 1/2 for direct
transitions.

The photoelectrochemical performance of the electrodes
was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry in the dark and under illumination
in a three-electrode cell consisting of a working electrode, a Ag/AgCl
(3 M KCl) reference electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and
1 M NaOH (pH 13.6) electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. The electrode area was 0.12 cm2 defined by an epoxy
frame. Alternatively, a 0.1 M Na2SO3 solution
was added to the electrolyte as a hole scavenger. The measurements
were carried out by using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat PGSTAT302,
and a 300 W Xe lamp was used for those experiments under illumination
conditions. The light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW/cm2 using a thermopile, and illumination was carried out through the
electrolyte. All the potentials were referred to the reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE) through the Nernst equation: VRHE = VAg/AgCl + VAg/AgCl0 +
0.059pH. Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements
were performed with a 150 W Xe lamp coupled with a monochromator and
an optical power meter. The photocurrent was measured at 1.23 V versus
RHE, with a 10 nm spectral step. IPCE was calculated through the expression , where Iph is
the photocurrent measured at a wavelength λ and P is the power of monochromatic light at the same wavelength. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed between 50
mHz and 1 MHz with 20 mV amplitude perturbation, with a step potential
of 64 mV in the anodic direction. The EIS data were analyzed with
ZView software (Scribner Associates). With the extracted capacitance
values from EIS, Mott–Schottky analysis was carried out using
the expression , where CSC represents
depletion capacitance, ϕSC = V – VFB is the voltage drop at the space charge region, V is the applied voltage, VFB is the flat band potential, ND is the
donor density, e is the elementary charge, ε0 is
the permittivity in vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity
of TiO2 (taken as 50),33k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the
absolute temperature, taken as 298 K. From this analysis, the values
of VFB and ND were extracted. The depletion layer width was calculated to validate
the employed model through the equation . Carrier diffusion length was calculated
by ,
where Rct is
the charge transfer resistance and Rtr is the transport resistance, both extracted from the EIS analysis.
