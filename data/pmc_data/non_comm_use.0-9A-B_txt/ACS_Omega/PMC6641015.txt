Three molybdenum(VI) cis-dioxo catalysts (8–10) were synthesized
with the goal of
developing stable and selective oxidation catalysts for sulfoxidation.
Their reactivities were investigated with a variety of substrates.
We have demonstrated the usefulness of these catalysts for the chemoselective
sulfoxidation of sulfides in the presence of reactive moieties, which
has important applications for total synthesis processes. Notably,
these catalysts are able to oxidize compounds analogous to sulfur
mustard and can be used as an alternative to sodium periodate or meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA)
for the oxidation of various organic sulfides without sacrificing
total conversion. As the catalysts are tolerant of water and hydrogen
peroxide, they allow for the design of completely green oxidation
reactions, particularly for sulfur-containing amino acids.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Molybdenum(VI)
dioxo complexes have been extensively studied. Much
of the interest in these compounds is derived from their oxygen atom
transfer chemistry and their relationship to biological oxotransferase
enzymes, which feature sulfur ligands.1,2 Consequently,
molybdenum(VI) dioxo catalysts are often used for epoxidation and
sulfoxidation reactions.1,3−8 Rao et al. reported on molybdenum(VI) dioxo complexes with ONS-type
ligands for the oxidation of olefins to epoxides (Figure 1).1 A similar ONO-type ligand system was used in the synthesis of sulfoxides
from sulfides (Figure 2).9,10

dioxo complex.

Recyclable, inexpensive,
and stable catalysts are desirable for
industrial and synthetic applications. Selective oxidation of sulfides
to sulfoxides is important. Sulfoxides are used prominently for the
Mislow–Evans rearrangement in organic synthesis, involving
a 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement to transform allylic sulfoxides to
allylic alcohols.11 This transformation
is used in the synthesis of various natural products of medicinal
value.11 One such application is in the
synthesis of β-lactam PS-5-type antibiotics, where the sulfoxide
is subjected to substitution with a methyl ester to allow for further
transformations. The oxidation of the sulfide, shown in Scheme 1, to the corresponding sulfoxide
is performed with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA), with yields ranging from 53 to 99%.12 In the work by Kita et al., this particular
step is conserved in the synthesis of optically pure (+)-PS-5 and
(+)-thienamycin.13 Solid peroxides such
as m-CPBA, because of safety concerns, are more difficult
to use on industrial scale than tBuOOH or H2O2, and m-CPBA generates chlorobenzoic
acid (CBA) as a byproduct. The byproducts of oxidation from tBuOOH and H2O2 are t-butanol and water, respectively, which are environmentally much
more friendly than CBA. In more complex total syntheses, great care
must be taken during retrosynthesis to ensure that an oxidation step
will not occur in the presence of other reactive functional groups.
This leads to roundabout synthetic designs or routes that must use
a large number of protecting groups that must then be deprotected.
Both of these approaches significantly decrease the overall yield
of a total synthesis.

for the Synthesis of
PS-5-Type Antibiotics11
Oxidation of sulfides has also been widely used
in industry, the
most general application being in the removal of sulfide impurities
from oil, known as oxidative desulfurization.14 More selective and efficient oxidative methods can allow industrial
use of milder oxidants and conditions, allowing for the reduction
of waste and toxic byproducts. A more specific application of sulfoxidation
is in the synthesis of chiral vinylglycine from methionine. Rapoport
and Afzali-Ardakani reported a synthesis of (l)-vinylglycine
in 1980 with an overall yield of 54%, which stands so far as the highest
reported overall yield and therefore the most widely used method for
the synthesis of vinylglycine.15−17 Chiral vinylglycine is useful
as an enzyme inhibitor16,18 and as a derivative for amide
functionality19 within enantiopure target
organic molecules. As such, vinylglycine is produced on industrial
scale. With a mild, direct sulfoxidation of methionine, it is possible
to eliminate the necessity of protection/deprotection of both the
carboxylic acid and amine functional groups. Removing these steps
greatly increases the overall yield and atom economy and decreases
excessive waste in the production of vinylglycine.

The ONS ligand
scaffold, shown in Figure 2, was reported by Topich and Lyon for molybdenum(VI) cis-dioxo complexes.20−23 The previously known complexes 8 and 9 have been shown to catalyze oxygen transfer to phosphines.20,21,23 However, no further investigations
into useful transformation or applications of these complexes have
been reported. As the types of molybdenum dioxo complexes are able
to catalyze oxygen transfer to sulfides,9,10 we investigated
the ability of these complexes for sulfoxidation. Herein, we report
the first synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of MoVI(O)2(H2sal-eta) (8), MoVI(O)2(H2sal-eta-p-Br) (9), and MoVI(O)2(H2sal-eta-o,p-Cl) (10). These catalysts
are able to oxidize sulfides to sulfoxides with excellent yield and
selectivity and are tolerant to the presence of various reactive moieties,
such as carboxylic acids, unprotected amines, and halides.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
The
synthesis of all three Mo(O)2(ONS) catalysts proceeded
smoothly, providing a high yield of pure complexes. The desired ONS
ligand can be synthesized directly from the condensation of the corresponding
salicylaldehyde derivative and cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol). As
shown in Scheme 2,
these ligands can oxidatively cyclize to the thermodynamically stable
five-membered dihydrothiazole. As the electron-withdrawing character
of the aromatic substituents increases, the amount of dihydrothiazole
formed increases because of the inductive effect at the imine carbon.
However, formation of this side product does not affect metalation
when the ligand is used crude. The tridentate linear ONS ligand metalates
preferentially over the bidentate dihydrothiazole. This results in
the precipitated complex being obtained analytically pure by 1H NMR after simple filtration and washing.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of the
ONS-Type Ligands and Their Dihydrothiazole Side
Product
Ligands 7, 11, and 12 are
highly soluble in chloroform and acetonitrile, but their molybdenum
complexes are less soluble and highly soluble only in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF). Therefore, 1H NMR analysis
had to be conducted in DMSO. Metalation of ligand 7 saw
the disappearance of the phenolic peak (10.6 ppm) and thiol peak (2.6
ppm) as these functional groups were now deprotonated and coordinated
to molybdenum. The inductive effect from the coordinated molybdenum
is the strongest for the protons alpha to the nitrogen, shifting each
peak downfield approximately by 0.5 ppm. The protons alpha to the
sulfur, however, shifted downfield only by 0.2 ppm. Complexes 9 and 10, with bromide and chloride aromatic
substituents respectively, experience a lesser deshielding effect
on the protons alpha to the nitrogen, with a shift of approximately
0.3 ppm downfield. The protons alpha to the sulfur for complexes 10 and 11 experience a greater effect from the
molybdenum, with downfield shifts of approximately 0.3 and 0.4 ppm,
respectively.

2.1.1 X-ray Crystallography Data
All
complexes were grown as single crystals in a vapor diffusion chamber
with DMF and ether. Complete information regarding software and data
collection can be found in the Supporting Information. The crystal structures are shown in Figure 3. The bond lengths calculated from the crystal
structures of complexes 8–10 conform
to the expected values for molybdenum(VI).

Figure 3 Catalyst 8 bond lengths in angstroms: Mo–O1
= 1.979, Mo–O2 = 2.341, Mo–O3 = 1.703, Mo–O4
= 1.694, Mo–N1 = 2.265, Mo–S1 = 2.411. Catalyst 9 bond lengths: Mo–O1 = 1.986, Mo–O2 = 2.313,
Mo–O3 = 1.715, Mo–O4 = 1.698, Mo–N1 = 2.265,
Mo–S1 = 2.413. Catalyst 10 bond lengths: Mo–O1
= 1.993, Mo–O2 = 1.702, Mo–O3 = 1.711, Mo–O4
= 2.298, Mo–N1 = 2.264, Mo–S1 = 2.410 [Oak Ridge thermal
ellipsoid plot (ORTEP) diagram; thermal ellipsoids at 50% probability;
and H atoms were omitted for clarity]. These crystal structures and
their corresponding data include a coordinated DMF molecule. This
DMF molecule is present from the conditions under which the crystals
were grown and is not present in the dry samples, as is evident from 1H NMR analyses.

2.1.2 UV–Vis Spectroscopy Data
UV–vis data were obtained by preparing a 0.2 mM solution of
catalyst 8 in DMSO. Maurya et al. had previously reported
that the H2sal-eta ligand has UV–vis peaks at 215,
255, and 316 nm, which were assigned to ϕ → ϕ*,
π → π*, and n → π* transitions, respectively.24Figure 4 shows the UV–vis spectrum of complex 9, which exhibits two distinct peaks at 360 and 270 nm. The broad
lower energy band at 360 nm can be assigned to the now-present ligand-to-metal
charge transfer25 overlapping with an n
→ π* transition of the ligand. The higher energy 270
nm peak still corresponds to the π → π* of intraligand
transitions.

2.2 Sulfoxidation
2.2.1 Substrates and Scope of Reaction
Development of the
reaction methodology was done with diethyl sulfide
as a substrate representative. It should be noted that all Mo(O)2(ONS-type) catalysts are sparingly soluble in most common
organic solvents, with the exception of DMSO and DMF. Therefore, each
reaction has at least two phases: solid, suspended catalyst and organic
substrate. For solvents, the organic substrates are insoluble in,
for example, diethyl sulfide in water, and the reaction becomes triphasic.
As seen in Table 1,
organic, aprotic solvents performed best when paired with tBuOOH, whereas H2O performed best with H2O2. Although the reaction is not selective when
performed neat with H2O2, it is selective with tBuOOH, as the organic peroxide can act as a solvent for
the substrate. Both of these conditions, H2O2 in water and tBuOOH neat without solvent, are noteworthy
because they are “green”, eliminating the need to use
volatile and toxic organic solvents.a

a Determined by NMR using diphenylmethane
as an internal standard; remaining percent values refer to unreacted
sulfide.

It was possible
to obtain over 90% sulfoxide yields with organic
solvent and water (entries 1, 3, and 7). However, for water-insoluble
sulfides, a slight excess of H2O2 was needed
to drive the reaction further (entries 6 and 7). As shown later, this
is not necessary for water-soluble sulfides. This eliminates the possibility
of loss of H2O2 into O2 and H2O by the molybdenum catalyst. This environmentally friendly,
or green, condition was tested with other simple sulfides to investigate
the scope of applicability. Table 2 summarizes these results. Simple dialkyl substrates
are tolerant of the green conditions. However, the aromatic sulfide
did not react at all, and only the starting sulfide was observed by
NMR after 8 h. Therefore, it was unsurprising that thiophene was also
inert to these reaction conditions. It is unclear why (chloromethyl)(methyl)sulfide
(Table 2, entry 4)
decomposed under the reaction conditions. However, by NMR, there were
no peaks corresponding to the sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, or hydrolysis
derivatives. The peaks that were observed could not be assigned to
any known, reasonable product. This substrate was successfully oxidized
under the conditions discussed later.

so this entry was run for 5 h.

c No reaction after 6 h.

Because of the narrow scope of the hydrogen peroxide conditions
with catalyst 8, we turned our attention back to the
high-yielding organic solvents. Table 1 (entries 1 and 3) shows acetonitrile and chloroform
as the best candidates. Further substrate testing with both solvents
revealed that chloroform was a superior choice for higher yields over
a wider variety of substrates. Four simple organic sulfides were subjected
to the chloroform/tBuOOH reaction conditions with
each molybdenum catalyst. The results are shown in Table 3. All catalysts performed equally
with all substrates, with the exception of a small drop in the conversion
of (chloromethyl)(methyl)sulfide with catalyst 9 (entry
8). The excellent conversion for the oxidation of (chloromethyl)(methyl)sulfide
is of particular importance as this sulfide is a model compound for
sulfur mustard, which is a highly toxic chemical warfare agent. It
is critical for the oxidation of sulfur mustards to be selective for
the sulfoxide without overoxidation to the sulfone as the sulfone
derivatives are nearly as toxic as the parent compounds.26

were performed with
1 mol % catalyst in CDCl3 with tBuOOH
(1 equiv) at room temperature for 30 min.

b Determined by NMR using diphenylmethane
as an internal standard; remaining percents were unreacted sulfide.

Three controls were performed
for the sulfoxidation reaction. First,
the reaction was performed in the absence of catalyst. Although sulfides
will oxidize in the presence of an equimolar amount of peroxides,
they must be stirred at least overnight or longer, and under noncatalytic
conditions, they do not show selective oxidation. This slow oxidation
is in stark contrast to the rapid 5–30 min completion times
in the presence of Mo(O)2(ONS-type) catalysts. Second,
the reaction was performed in the absence of peroxide to verify that
it was indeed the peroxide, not oxygen from the atmosphere, that was
participating in the reaction. Finally, an equimolar amount of peroxide
was stirred with catalyst 8 for 1 h (longer than the
length of most reactions), at which point it was analyzed by 1H NMR to determine whether the sulfur on the ligands of the
catalysts are oxidized at all, thereby potentially changing the active
catalyst species. However,
there was no change in the NMR, particularly focusing on those protons
alpha to the sulfur, so it can be concluded that the ligand structure
is not affected by the presence of peroxide. It is probable that the
peroxide instead changes the structure of the catalyst at the oxo
moieties, resulting in an oxo-peroxo structure. These types of structures
have been observed with other molybdenum dioxo catalysts in the presence
of peroxides.27,28

2.2.2 Achiral
Sulfoxide Intermediates in Total
Synthesis
Encouraged by our initial results, we sought to
broaden the substrate scope by examining more useful substrates from
a synthesis viewpoint. Sulfoxides are used in organic synthesis for
the Mislow–Evans rearrangement.11 In these preparations, it is necessary to oxidize the sulfide to
the sulfoxide. As such, it is extremely useful to have a mild oxidation
reaction that is tolerant of various functional groups to eliminate
the need for protecting the groups, which increases the number of
linear steps required in a synthesis sequence. Figure 5 shows two sulfides (5 and 14) used as precursors for the Mislow–Evans rearrangement
in total synthesis preparations11 and their
respective simplified model substrate structures. Only catalyst 8 was tested because all three catalysts have nearly identical
reactivity. Both substrates 13 and 15 were
successfully oxidized to their sulfoxide counterparts with catalyst 8. Substrate 15 was converted only to 85% sulfoxide
(17) in 30 min under the optimized conditions; however,
after reacting for 90 min, no remaining sulfide was present and 100%
conversion to the sulfoxide was observed by 1H NMR. Substrate 13 was synthesized from 4-acetoxy-2-azetidinone according
to the literature procedure.29 The resultant
sulfide 13 was converted to corresponding sulfoxide 16 in 61% yield under our standard reaction conditions.

and the structures from which they were derived.

2.2.3 Sulfoxide Pyrolysis in the Synthesis of
VinylGlycine
The next substrate we tested to examine the
versatility and tolerance of catalyst 8 was d-methionine. The first attempt to oxidize d-methionine was
done using the optimized CDCl3 conditions that were successful
for all previous organic substrates. However, no reaction was observed
under these conditions. Upon examination of the reaction vessel, the
reason became apparent. d-Methionine is not soluble in chloroform,
resulting in a suspension of the substrate. As we had previously noted,
the reaction works best when the substrate is dissolved in the liquid
phase. From the experiments performed during optimization, we noted
that reaction conditions with hydrogen peroxide, “green conditions”,
could work with varying degrees of success, depending on the substrate.
Therefore, we decided to test the reaction in D2O and H2O2 with d-methionine. Under these conditions,
100% of d-methionine was converted to the sulfoxide in 30
min. The 1H NMR showed that the catalyst was unreactive
toward the carboxylic acid and free amine. This result has promising
applications. Researchers trying to perform sulfoxidations late in
total synthesis preparations could use this methodology to achieve
direct sulfoxidation from sulfides without the need to protect and
deprotect various functional groups on their compounds, thus simplifying
their total synthesis and increasing their overall yield. More specifically,
the successful direct oxidation of d-methionine could greatly
improve the current method for the preparation of (R)-vinylglycine if the unprotected sulfoxide can be cleaved to give
(R)-vinylglycine directly. Various literature procedures
for the direct cleavage of sulfoxides15,30−33 have proven unsuccessful thus far for this direct cleavage. Unable
to achieve the direct cleavage of d-methionine sulfoxide,
we sought to improve upon the total yield of the synthesis of vinylglycine
reported by Rapoport (Scheme 3) and provide a more benign alternative to using NaIO4 using our sulfoxidation procedure. Indeed, we were able to
convert 18 to the corresponding sulfoxide (19) quantitatively.

3 Catalyst
Recyclability
Finally, the recyclability of complex 8 was tested.
As this complex did not hydrolyze in glacial acetic acid over 5 days,
we expected a low catalyst deactivation and therefore a good recyclability.
First, a basic sulfoxidation reaction was performed with methyl p-tolyl sulfide (run 1). For this reaction, the catalyst
loading was decreased to 0.5 mol % to slow down the reaction so that
consistent NMR data could be obtained over a longer reaction time.
All other reaction parameters followed the standard sulfoxidation
reaction protocol. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature
for 90 min, with points taken every 5 min for the first 30 min and
then every 20 min for the remaining time. After 90 min, most of the
catalyst had dissolved, and the reaction solution was filtered to
remove the remaining insoluble catalyst. This supernatant was then
subjected to another sulfoxidation reaction (run 2) with an additional
equivalent of sulfide and oxidant, without the addition of any more
catalyst. As shown in Figure 5, the catalyst remaining in the solution from run 1 was still
highly active, with total conversion dropping only to 85% in run 2
from 97% conversion at the end of run 1. The insoluble catalyst that
was isolated after run 1 was filtered and dried to yield 1.2 mg. A
third sulfoxidation reaction (run 3) was scaled so that the 1.2 mg
of insoluble catalyst was also 0.5 mol %. It is evident from the data,
shown in Figure 6,
that this insoluble catalyst is no longer useful as an active catalyst.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the soluble homogenous complex
is the active catalyst and that this soluble complex retains most
of its reactivity between subsequent reactions.

Figure 6 Recyclability of Mo(O)2(H2sal-eta) with methyl p-tolyl
sulfide. Diphenylmethane was used as an internal
standard in each reaction. Run 1: 1 equiv methyl p-tolyl sulfide, 1 equiv tBuOOH, 0.5 mol % catalyst 8, CDCl3, 90 min, RT. Run 2: filtered supernatant
from run 1, additional 1 equiv sulfide, additional 1 equiv tBuOOH, no additional catalyst. Run 3: dried solid residue
from run 1 (1.2 mg), sulfoxidation reaction scaled to 0.5 mol % catalyst
loading.

4 Conclusions
We have
synthesized three molybdenum(VI) cis-dioxo
catalysts based on the H2sal-eta ancillary ligand and confirmed
their structures. It has been shown that all three of these catalysts
are able to selectively oxidize substituted sulfides to sulfoxides
quickly and selectively, with low catalyst loading (0.5 mol %) and
in excellent yields. These catalysts are air and water stable, allowing
them to be stored for months without evidence of decomposition. These
catalysts are tolerant of olefins, free amines, amides, and halogens.
Sulfoxidation in the presence of chlorine allows these catalysts to
be used for the neutralization of mustard gas and other similar compounds.
With Mo(O)2(H2sal-eta), we have been able to
achieve direct, quantitative, green oxidation of d-methionine
without the need for protecting groups. The successful cleavage of
the sulfoxide group to the vinylidene would drastically increase the
overall yield in the production of (R)-vinylglycine.
As demonstrated by our model substrate studies, this sulfoxidation
method can also be applied to the total synthesis of useful compounds
that use achiral sulfoxide intermediates, which has the potential
to simplify the total synthesis of various compounds, significantly
increasing their overall yield and decreasing the cost of production.
Our recyclability investigations have also shown that these catalyst
types are durable, allowing them to retain most of their activity
through successive reactions.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
All NMR and kinetics experiments
were performed on a Bruker ARX400 NMR spectrometer. Elemental analyses
were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. UV–vis experiments
were performed in DMSO with an Agilent Technologies Cary 60 UV–vis
instrument, coupled with a Quantum Northwest temperature control unit
and using a 1 cm quartz cell. IR measurements were taken using a Thermo
Nicolet Nexus FT-IR. Electron spray ionization mass spectrometry was
performed by the interdepartmental mass spectrometry facility at Purdue
University.

5.2 General Sulfoxidation Procedure
To
a 20 mL vial were added MoVI(O)2L (1 mg, 0.01
equiv), sulfide (1 equiv), CDCl3 (1 mL), and diphenylmethane
as an internal NMR standard. To this stirred suspension, tBuOOH (5 M in decane, 1 equiv) was added. The reaction solution was
capped and stirred at room temperature under ambient atmosphere for
30 min, at which time the reaction solution was analyzed using NMR.

5.3 Synthesis of cis-MoVI(O)2(H2sal-eta) (8)
The
H2sal-eta ligand (7) was prepared according
to the previously reported literature procedure.24 The crude ligand was used directly in the next reaction
without further purification.b

The complex
was prepared by dissolving ligand 7 (1.206 g, 6.654 mmol)
and Mo(O)2(acac)2 (2.170 g, 6.654 mmol) in acetonitrile
(40 mL) to make a yellow solution. Slightly heating the reaction solution
at approximately 35 °C immediately gave a bright orange-red precipitate.
The reaction solution was stirred for 15 min to ensure complete metalation.
The resultant suspension was cooled to room temperature, filtered,
washed with acetonitrile and hexane, and dried under vacuum to give
the pure product (1.880 g, yield 92%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ (ppm) = 8.79 (s, 1H, imine =C–H),

from vapor diffusion with DMF and diethyl ether.

5.4 Synthesis of cis-MoVI(O)2(H2sal-eta-p-Br) (9)
Ligand 11 (500 mg, 1.922 mmol) and
equimolar Mo(O)2(acac)2 were dissolved in acetonitrile
(10 mL) to make a bright yellow solution. The reaction began to proceed
at ambient temperature but was gently heated at approximately 35 °C,
which greatly increased the reaction rate. As the reaction progressed,
a bright orange precipitate formed. The reaction suspension was cooled
to room temperature, filtered, washed with acetonitrile and cold methanol,
and dried under vacuum to give the pure product (680 mg, yield 92%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ (ppm)

5.5 Synthesis of cis-MoVI(O)2(H2sal-eta-o,p-Cl) (10)
Ligand 12 (500 mg, 1.999
mmol) and equimolar Mo(O)2(acac)2 were dissolved
in acetonitrile to make a bright yellow solution. The reaction solution
was gently heated at approximately 40 °C. The solution turned
dark, but no precipitate was observed, so pyridine (161 μL)
was added. A precipitate immediately began to form, and the reaction
solution was stirred for 1 h. The resultant suspension was cooled
to room temperature, filtered, washed with acetonitrile and cold methanol,
and dried under vacuum to give the pure product (448 mg, yield 60%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ (ppm)
= 8.80 (s, 1H, imine =C–H), 8.58 (d, J = 4.6 Hz, 1H, Ar), 7.82 (d, J = 2.7 Hz, 1H, Ar),

a It should be noted that because neat
reactions must be dissolved in a deuterated solvent before analysis,
the introduction of the solvent may have increased the overall yield
but cannot account for the total conversion observed as analyses were
performed promptly after the addition of deuterated solvent.

b The side product of the ligand synthesis
is the cyclized dihydrothiazole, which does not ligate to molybdenum.
