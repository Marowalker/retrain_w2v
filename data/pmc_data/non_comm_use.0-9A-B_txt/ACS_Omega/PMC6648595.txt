molecules. However, nonspecific displacement in the physisorption
systems is a non-negligible problem for the intracellular analysis.

of resisting nonspecific displacement of 3D MIL-100, the assay and
imaging of ATP in living cells were realized. Our results demonstrated
that the MIL/aptamer-FAM nanosensor not only shows high selectivity

for intracellular delivery and metabolite detection.

Introduction
Development of fluorescent
nanosensors for sensing biomolecules
is of great importance for clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.1−4 Recently, fluorescent probes physisorbed on nanomaterials have emerged
as a kind of useful and facile sensing platform, in which carbon nanomaterials,
such as carbon nanoparticles,5 single-walled
carbon nanotubes,6,7 and graphene oxide (GO),8−12 are the most universal carriers. In this platform, fluorophore-labeled
probes could be adsorbed on the surface of carbon nanostructures by
π-stacking and hydrophobic interactions, leading to fluorescence
quenching via fluorescence resonance energy transfer.8 Although specific desorption of the probes from the nanostructures
by target molecules has been well performed, the nonspecific probe
displacement in the physisorption system by nontarget molecules, especially
nontarget proteins, cannot be ignored.9−11 This is the particular
problem for intracellular analysis because there is a high concentration
of proteins in living cells. To solve this problem, several strategies,
such as using a reference probe as the internal standard10 or employing an aptamer beacon covalently linked
to GO,11 have been developed. Despite some
progress, their preparations are elaborate and fussy. Therefore, the
research on other materials capable of resisting nonspecific displacement
is still imperative.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
are an emerging class of
hybrid materials with infinite tunability constructed from the assembly
of metal ions or clusters and easily tunable organic linkers.13−16 Among them, the MIL (Materials of Institut Lavoisier) family built
from trivalent metal centers bridged by carboxylate ligands displays
enhanced stability, high porosity, large surface area, and intriguing
three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure,17,18 which made
it attractive for biological and biomedical applications.19−22 For example, some suitable iron(III) carboxylate MILs with nanoscale
dimension and nontoxic nature have been used as nanocarriers for drug
delivery19,20 and as analytical platforms for various
biomolecules.21,22 However, exploration of MILs
with in situ monitoring, intracellular analysis, and imaging remains
at a very early stage. Herein, we report, for the first time, the
3D porous MIL-100 with formula Fe3O(H2O)2(BTC)2F as an analytical platform for intracellular
sensing and imaging of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) without nonspecific
probe displacement in the physisorption system. In this approach,
the carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled ATP aptamer (denoted as Apt-F)
is bound to MIL-100 and the fluorescence of FAM is efficiently quenched
by the photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) effect.23 In the presence of ATP, Apt-F is released from MIL-100,
leading to the fluorescence recovery of FAM. Meanwhile, the aptamer
will not be disturbed by the nontarget molecules, especially nontarget
proteins, in living cells (Scheme 1). Therefore, intracellular ATP sensing and imaging
will be realized.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of MIL/Apt-F as a Nanosensor
Capable of Resisting
Nonspecific Displacement for ATP Imaging in Living Cells
As reported previously, ATP,
as the primary energy currency, plays
significant roles in cellular physiological processes and biochemical
reactions.24,25 Because of its great importance,
many approaches have been developed for ATP sensing,26−35 including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),26 enzyme-based,27,28 aptamer-based,8,10−12,29−32 and protein-based methods.35 Currently,
development of aptamer-based systems that are cell-permeable, against
enzymatic cleavage, and capable of resisting nonspecific displacement
is still facing a huge challenge for monitoring ATP in living cells.
For instance, when an aptamer/GO sensor is used in a biological matrix,
especially inside cells, the adsorbed aptamer might be displaced by
nontarget proteins, thus producing false-positive signals.9,10 In this work, we have fabricated an MIL/aptamer-FAM (denoted as
MIL/Apt-F) nanosensor with dramatic capability of resisting nonspecific
displacement providing a new kind of assay platform for ATP sensing
and imaging in living cells.

Results and Discussion
Construction and Characterization
of MIL-100 and MIL/Apt-F Nanosensors
MIL-100 was constructed
from biocompatible iron(III) and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic
acid (BTC) to form a 3D MTN-type zeolitic architecture bearing two
types of mesoporous cages of free apertures of ca. 25 and 29 Å
accessible through two pore windows of ca. 5.5 and 8.6 Å, respectively.37 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
showed that MIL-100 crystals were well dispersed with an average diameter
of about 120 nm (Figure S1A), and the energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectrum indicated the distribution of Fe, C, and O within
the nanocrystals (Figure S1B, the signal
of Cu was from the TEM grid). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns
of MIL-100 and its fresh powder immersed in the Tris-HCl buffer solution
for 24 h were in agreement with that of the simulated sample (Figure S2), suggesting its bulky phase purity
and buffer stability. N2 sorption isotherms (Figure S3) revealed the permanent porosity of
MIL-100, whose Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area is
820 m2/g. Because MIL-100 can adsorb single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) sequences, a noncovalent conjugate of MIL/Apt-F was constructed
by simple self-assembly of MIL-100 with ATP aptamer-FAM (Apt-F), which
is demonstrated by the appreciable decrease of ζ-potential (Figure S4) and in the amount of N2 sorption (Figure S3). Figure S5A shows that the fluorescence intensity of Apt-F
decreased with the increase of MIL-100 concentration, implying that
Apt-F was strongly adsorbed onto the surface of MIL-100, thus leading
to the quenching of the fluorescence of FAM. The fluorescence of 10
nM Apt-F was nearly completely quenched when the concentration of
MIL-100 reached 0.3 mg/mL and the Apt-F loading efficiency of MIL-100
is 33.3 nmol/g. To further explore the kinetics of the fluorescence
quenching, the time-dependent fluorescence intensity of Apt-F by MIL-100
as a function of incubation time was examined (Figure S5B). The fluorescence intensity decreased rapidly
with the increase of time and reached equilibrium around 5 min, suggesting
that MIL-100 can adsorb Apt-F effectively and quickly. Finally, the
stability of the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor under physiological pH range
and different Mg2+ ionic concentrations was tested (Figure S6). The results indicated that it was
stable at physiological conditions and had great potential for molecular
probing in living cells.

Fluorescence Sensing of ATP with MIL/Apt-F
After preparation,
the MIL/Apt-F conjugate was used as a fluorescent nanosensor for ATP
detection. Initially, Apt-F exhibited a strong fluorescence emission
in Tris-HCl buffer (Figure 1, curve a), while the fluorescence emission was greatly quenched
after the introduction of MIL-100 (Figure 1, curve b), suggesting that MIL-100 has the
excellent capabilities of binding ssDNA and quenching dye fluorescence,
which mainly results from the strong π-stacking interaction
between the unpaired nucleobases and the π-conjugated BTC ligand
as well as the enhanced PET effect by the high electron-accepting
ability of the Fe(III) centers.22 In the
presence of ATP, the ATP aptamer could target ATP, causing formation
of a duplex configuration with a large cross-sectional area and relatively
rigid structure,38 which would be released
from the surface of MIL-100, thereby leading to the fluorescence recovery
(Figure 1, curve c)
and increase in the amount of N2 sorption (Figure S3). In this sense, MIL/Apt-F can be used
as an excellent analysis platform for ATP detection. Figure 2A shows that the fluorescence
intensity was gradually enhanced with the increase of ATP concentration,
which was linear with ATP concentration in the range from 50 μM
to 0.4 mM (Figure 2B), with a detection limit of 31 μM, implying that the MIL/Apt-F
nanosensor was sensitive enough to meet the requirement for the detection
of intracellular ATP.39,40 The kinetics of MIL/Apt-F toward
ATP was examined by monitoring the fluorescence intensity as a function
of time. As shown in Figure 2C, the fluorescence intensity reached equilibrium in 60 min.
To evaluate the selectivity of the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor for ATP detection,
the fluorescence responses toward different targets were investigated. Figure 2D shows that the
sensor only displayed a small fluorescence response toward adenosine
monophosphate (AMP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP), guanosine triphosphate
(GTP), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) when they were at a high concentration
of 1.0 mM, while a large fluorescence enhancement was induced only
by 0.5 mM ATP under the same conditions, indicating a high selectivity
of this sensor toward ATP over other analogues.

conditions (λex = 485 nm): (a) Apt-F in Tris-HCl

Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2) with 0.3 mg/mL of MIL/Apt-F at room
temperature, where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of MIL/Apt-F at 520 nm before and
after treatment with ATP, respectively. Error bars were obtained from
three parallel experiments.

Nonspecific probe displacement in a physisorption system
by nontarget
proteins, thus producing false-positive signals, is particularly problematic
for intracellular analysis. Therefore, we tested the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor
responses to bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was chosen as the representation
of nontarget proteins. As shown in Figure 3A, the sensor has little response BSA, and
even its concentration reached 2 mg/mL. For comparison, a 2D sheet
MOF, Cu(H2dtoa),41 has been
applied as the adsorption material in this MOF/Apt-F system. As displayed
in Figure 3B, an obvious
fluorescence enhancement was observed in the presence of BSA, and
the fluorescence intensity reached the maximum value when BSA exceeded
0.5 mg/mL (7.5 μM), suggesting that nonspecific desorption of
ssDNA from Cu(H2dtoa) will occur, especially when the nontarget
proteins are at relatively high concentrations. In addition, compared
with MIL/Apt-F, the sensors based on GO had higher response toward
BSA (Table S1). It has been well known
that 3D MOFs can distinguish ssDNA from dsDNA more effectively than
2D layered materials.4,42 Similarly, in the MIL/Apt-F system,
the single-strand ATP aptamers can be close to the surface of MIL-100
and wrap around its 3D surface strongly because of their small cross-sectional
areas and flexible conformation.4 In the
presence of nontarget proteins, they would not be able to be close
enough to the surface of MIL-100 easily and further interact with
the aptamers strongly because of their large cross-sectional areas
and relatively rigid structures, whereas the small molecules, such
as ATP, can readily be close enough to interact with the aptamers.
Therefore, MIL-100 could well resist the nonspecific probe desorption.
Finally, we further measured the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor responses to
several possible interfering proteins in living systems, including
human serum albumin (HSA), thrombin, lysozyme, and cell lysis solution
(ATP was eliminated by the apyrase.43),
for the nonspecific desorption assay (Figure 3C). It has been found that the sensor displayed
a lower fluorescence response toward these proteins compared to ATP.
The above results demonstrated that the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor could
be applied as a highly selective platform for ATP detection in the
complex matrix, especially inside living cells and systems.

for all the detection in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM, pH 7.2) at room temperature.

Intracellular ATP Imaging
with the MIL/Apt-F Nanosensor
When the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor
was used for monitoring ATP in living
cells, we need to first culture it with cells in medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), a protein mixture.8 Therefore, the nonspecific desorption caused by FBS was
examined. As shown in Figure S7, there
was no obvious fluorescence enhancement in the presence of different
concentrations of FBS, suggesting that the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor is
highly stable and less susceptible to FBS in the medium. Furthermore,
the ATP aptamer could also be well protected by MIL-100 against enzymatic
cleavage during the cellular transit (Figure S8). The cytotoxicity of the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor on HeLa cells was
then evaluated using the MTT assay.36 As
indicated in Figure S9, HeLa cells still
retained cell viability >85% after they were treated with different
concentrations of the sensor. These results illustrated that the MIL/Apt-F
nanosensor has great potential for sensing and imaging ATP in living
cells.

Then, we incubated HeLa cells with the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor
and examined the cell imaging by confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM). In Figure 4A, we can see a significant fluorescence signal of the cells treated
with MIL/Apt-F, demonstrating successful intracellular aptamer delivery
and ATP imaging via the sensor. What’s more, it was clear that
the green fluorescence of FAM was present in the cytoplasm (Figure S10), which further indicated efficient
delivery of this nanosensor to the cytosol. Then the incubation time
was optimized to be 8 h by CLSM (Figure S11). To further confirm that the generation of fluorescence signal
was dependent on the endogenous ATP, the intracellular ATP level was
modulated through drug stimulation. As shown in Figure 4B, a remarkable fluorescence enhancement
was observed upon treatment of HeLa cells with Ca2+, a
well-known ATP inducer.44,45 In contrast, the fluorescence
intensity decreased dramatically when the cells were treated with
sodium azide that can induce an abrupt decrease of ATP concentration
(Figure 4C).46 Taken together, these results well demonstrate
that the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor is a viable tool to perform ATP imaging
in living cells and has high sensitivity for distinguishing the fluctuations
of the intracellular ATP level.

incubated with MIL/Apt-F. Scale bar: 50 μm.

Conclusions
In summary, an MIL/aptamer-based fluorescent
nanosensor for intracellular
ATP sensing and imaging is reported. The MIL/Apt-F nanosensor with
dramatic capability of resisting nonspecific displacement showed high
selectivity for the detection of ATP even in the complex biological
matrix. Moreover, because of its high functional stability, low cytotoxicity,
and desirable cell permeability, the MIL/Apt-F conjugate is able to
act as a “signal-on” nanosensor for specific imaging
of ATP in living cells. Considering the unique properties of the 3D
nanoscaled MIL, the new MIL/aptamer-based strategy holds great potential
for applications in the intracellular sensing of multiple analytes,
clinical diagnostics, as well as medical research.

Preparation of the MIL/Apt-F Nanosensor
MIL-100 was
synthesized according to the reported literature,21 and then the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor was prepared as follows:
0.3 mg of the synthesized MIL-100 was dispersed in 1 mL of Tris-HCl
buffer solution (20 mM, pH = 7.2; NaCl 137 mM, KCl 5 mM, and MgCl2 5 mM) by sonication. Then, 0.5 mL of the solution was mixed
with 10 nM ATP aptamer-FAM with oscillation for 10 min at room temperature
to form the MIL/Apt-F nanosensor.

Fluorimetric Measurements
In a typical assay, MIL/Apt-F
(0.3 mg/mL) was incubated with ATP (final concentrations ranging from
0 to 8.0 mM) or other biomolecules at ambient temperature for 1 h.
After reaction, the resulting solution was centrifuged, and the fluorescence
intensity of the supernatant was measured by recording the emission
wavelength from 508 to 620 nm with an excitation wavelength of 485
nm.

Cytotoxicity Assays and Cell Imaging
HeLa cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing
5% CO2. The cellular cytotoxicity of MIL/Apt-F toward HeLa
cells was evaluated using the MTT assay.36 To image endogenous ATP, the HeLa cells were pretreated with or
without 5 mM Ca2+ for 2 h or 10 mM sodium azide for 2 h
and then incubated with 300 μg/mL of MIL/Apt-F for 8 h. After
that, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline
solution and then imaged. The images were collected at 515–600
nm upon excitation at 488 nm.
