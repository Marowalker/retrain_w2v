Introduction
Solvent-involved reactions
have drawn considerable interest owing
to the rather low cost, relative stability, and low toxicity of solvents.
In the past decades, numerous procedures using dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)1 or tetrahydrofuran (THF) as versatile
reagents have been developed.2 Sulfoximines
have attracted a great deal of attention owing to their remarkable
biological activities3 and successful use
as ligands and auxiliaries in asymmetrical synthesis, structural units
in pseudopeptides, and directing groups for catalytic C–H functionalizations.4 Two regular routes for the preparation of sulfoximines
involve an oxidative imination of a sulfoxide and a nucleophilic substitution
of the corresponding sulfonimidoyl halide or sulfonimidate.5 Transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions
between aryl halides or pseudohalides and N-unsubstituted sulfoximines
have been established for the formation of N-aryl
sulfoximines in recent years.6 On the other
hand, hemiaminal ethers are the commonly found structural motifs in
many biologically active natural products and pharmaceutical agents.7 Although some traditional methods have been developed
for the construction of these skeletal structures, current interest
focused on the direct amination of C(sp33)–H bonds adjacent to an oxygen atom under transition-metal
catalysis or metal-free conditions.8 This
strategy circumvented the preinstallation of functional groups with
high atom and step economy. Despite the significant advancement, the
development of powerful and complementary transformations for sulfoximine
and hemiaminal ether synthesis is still desirable.

Benzofuroxan
(benzo[1,2-c]1,2,5-oxadiazole N-oxide,
BFX) derivatives exhibit a broad biological activity,
including antifungal, antileukemic, antibacterial, acaricidal, and
immunodepressive properties.9 The traditional
approaches used for the preparation of BFX included oxidation of o-nitroanilines and the tandem nucleophilic substitution/intramolecular
cyclization of o-chloronitrobenzene with sodium azide
in good yields.10 Hence, the BFX derivatives
have been utilized as synthetic intermediates to react with rich electron
species to produce heterocycle derivatives, through the Beirut reaction.11 Herein, we disclosed a direct imination of DMSO
to N-(2-nitro)phenyl dimethylsulfoximines using benzofuroxans
as aryliminating reagents (Scheme 1a).12 In the meantime, it
was also demonstrated that methanesulfonamides could be synthesized
in DMSO/H2O mixed solvent (Scheme 1b).13 It is important
to note that although DMSO has been employed as a multipurpose precursor
for carbon, sulfur, and oxygen sources for incorporation into target
molecules, only few examples act as −SO2Me source.14 Furthermore, we reported a novel protocol for
α-C–H amination with THF to hemiaminal ethers under ruthenium
catalyst with benzofuroxans as the nitro and nitrogen sources (Scheme 1c).

Scheme 1 Diverse
Transformations of Benzofuroxan with Different Solvents
Results and Discussion
Initially, we employed benzofuroxan 1a in DMSO as
a model reaction to screen the reaction conditions. As shown in Table 1, the reaction temperature
is vital to the transformation, but below 100 °C, the reaction
failed to produce the desired product (entry 1). When the reaction
was carried out at higher temperature, it showed that 135 °C
was suitable for this system (entries 2–4). We noted that the
starting material was not consumed completely for 8 h, then the reaction
time was examined, and good isolated yield was obtained for 16 h (entries
5–7). To our surprise, both sulfoximine 3a and
methanesulfonamide 4a could be formed in similar yields
when the reaction was proceeded in DMSO/H2O (3:1). Considering
the importance of methanesulfonamide in the fields of pharmaceuticals,
pesticides, and materials, the optimal conditions were also investigated.
It indicated that too much or too little water was detrimental to
the formation of 4a, and equivalent amounts of DMSO and
water afforded the best results (entries 8–11). After a few
attempts, the suitable condition to sulfoximine is DMSO solvent and
that to methanesulfonamide is DMSO/H2O (1:1) mixed solvent
at 135 °C for 16 h.

With optimized
reaction conditions available, we proceeded to evaluate
the scope of the reaction. As illustrated in Scheme 2, a wide range of benzofuroxans underwent
smoothly to furnish the corresponding products under the standard
conditions. Benzofuroxans with electron-rich and electron-poor substituents
were all compatible with this method (3b–3l). The substrates bearing a bulky tert-butyl
group delivered the product in good yield (3d). To our
delight, bromide- and iodide-substituted substrates can be smoothly
converted into the corresponding iminating products, which provided
opportunities for further coupling reactions under transition-metal-catalyzed
conditions (3i and 3j). In addition, the
substrates containing two substituents with the same or opposite electron
nature were also tolerated and showed little effect on the efficiency
(3c, 3h, 3k, and 3l). It should be noted that there was an interconversion of 1-oxide/3-oxide
tautomers of benzofuroxan derivatives through the transient formation
of an o-dinitroso intermediate; therefore, N-aryl sulfoximine isomers were obtained from asymmetrical
substrate.15 Interestingly, the C5 products
were the major products in most cases, irrespective of the C5- or
C6-substituted benzofuroxan (3b, 3d–3g, and 3i). The ratios of C4 and C5 products
were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. However, other
sulfoxide derivatives such as diethylsulfoxide, dipropyl sulfoxide,
and phenylmethyl sulfoxide were found to be unsuitable for this reaction,
and no corresponding products were detected. Moreover, this imination
reaction in a gram scale performed well and gave 3a in
satisfactory yield (3a). The structure of 3a was further confirmed by X-ray crystal diffraction measurements
(Figure 1).16 Following the above results, three examples
for methanesulfonamide synthesis were demonstrated under DMSO/H2O solvent. Both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
benzofuroxans could be successfully transformed to the corresponding
methanesulfonamides in good yields (4a–4c).

The reaction of benzofuroxan 1a and THF was explored
to search for suitable conditions (Table 2). Various commonly used transition-metal
catalysts were used to conduct this reaction. To our delight, we found
that RuCl3 could render the corresponding product in 10%
yield (entries 1–8). The reaction did not proceed without ruthenium
salt (entry 9). Encouraged by these results, a number of other ruthenium
catalysts were tested. The results showed that [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 displayed the highest catalytic activity
for this reaction, and 5a was isolated in 72% yield (entries
10–13). The effect of reaction time was further examined, and
the model reaction took place for 12 h, leading to the best yield
of 5a (entries 13–15). Lower temperature was disadvantageous
to this transformation (entry 16). Therefore, both ruthenium catalyst
and reaction temperature are crucial for this transformation.

Subsequently, the scope of benzofuroxans was investigated
for the
present transformation using THF as a standard substrate (Scheme 3). A set of substituted
benzofuroxans underwent ring-opening amination reaction smoothly (5b–5f). The symmetrical bisubstituted
benzofuroxans yielded the products in optimized conditions. It can
be inferred that the electron-donating groups are beneficial to the
transformation compared to the electron-deficient groups (5b and 5c). In addition, unsymmetric monosubstituted benzofuroxans
were applicable with excellent regioselectivity. Notably, these halide-substituted
substrates were compatible under standard conditions, providing the
possibility for further functionalization (5d–5f). Other cyclic ethers such as isochroman showed good reactivity
to render the corresponding product in medium yield (5g). However, tetrahydropyran did not generate the desired product.
Moreover, the exact structure of 5f was also confirmed
by X-ray crystal diffraction measurements (Figure 1).17

Raw material is C6-substituted
benzofuroxan; only the major isomer of the product is shown.

To illustrate the synthetic utility of the sulfoximine,
further
transformation is investigated in Scheme 4. Starting from N-(2-nitro)phenyl
dimethylsulfoximine 3a, the desired benzene-bridged aminosulfoximines 7 were prepared by a two-step reaction sequence. First, the
nitro group of 3a was reduced to afford aniline 6a; subsequent aniline reacted readily with aromatic aldehydes
to generate the target molecules 7 via reductive amination.
It is noteworthy that chiral benzene-bridged benzylaminosulfoximines
have been proved to be effective ligands for copper-catalyzed asymmetric
Mukaiyama aldol reactions.18

Scheme 4 Preparation
of Benzene-Bridged Benzylaminosulfoximines
To probe the mechanism, some controlled experiments were
carried
out (Scheme 5). The
deuterium-labeling experiments with DMSO-d6 demonstrated that dimethyl sulfoxide and methylsulfonyl moieties
came from DMSO (Scheme 5a,b). Subsequently, the model reaction was performed under an argon
atmosphere, and 4a was isolated in 86% yield (Scheme 5c). Additionally,
the isotopic labeling experiment using H218O
was conducted and 18O-labeled 4a was obtained
in 70% yield (Scheme 5d). These results proved that the additional oxygen atom in 4a originated from H2O. No product was detected
when 3a was subjected to H2O or DMSO/H2O; it suggested that 3a was not the intermediate
for the formation of 4a (Scheme 5e). Radical trapping experiments were performed
in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy or butylated
hydroxytoluene. The yields just decreased slightly, which suggested
that this should not be a radical pathway (Scheme 5f,g). Moreover, the reaction proceeded smoothly
under argon atmosphere (Scheme 5h).

Scheme 5 Controlled Experiments
On the basis of controlled experiments and earlier related
literature,
plausible mechanisms are proposed in Scheme 6. Initially, the nitrene intermediate A was formed through the retrocleavage of the furoxan ring
at the N–O bond (Scheme 6, eq 1). Dimethyl sulfoxide reacted with the nitrene intermediate
to yield the product 3a (Scheme 6, eq 2).19 Moreover,
the Ru catalyst activated the C(sp3)–H bonds adjacent
to the oxygen atom of THF and 5a was formed via the nitrene
insertion and protodemetalation process (Scheme 6, eq 3).20 The
possible mechanism for the formation of product 4a was
unclear at the present stage.

Scheme 6 Possible Mechanism
Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed diverse transformations based on
the reactions of benzofuroxans with DMSO or THF. The approach allowed
facile access to three types of molecular scaffolds: N-aryl dimethylsulfoximines, methanesulfonamides, and hemiaminal ethers.
The practical potential of the methodology was highlighted by transformation
of the sulfoximines into aminosulfoximines. Further investigations
on the synthetic applications and detailed mechanism are currently
underway in our laboratory.
