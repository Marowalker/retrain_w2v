Deep
eutectic solvents (DESs), featured as promising green solvents,
were applied to examine their effectiveness in pretreating raw ramie
fibers (RFs) for cellulose nanofibril (CNF) production. The pretreatment
performance of three DESs, i.e., choline chloride–urea (CU),
choline chloride–oxalic acid dihydrate (CO), and choline chloride–glycerol
(CG), was evaluated based on chemical composition analysis and structural
and morphological changes. CO attained the most dramatic morphological
changes of RFs, followed by CG and CU. Its high structural disruption
of RFs during the pretreatment process, shown in the results from
scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, could be
due to an outstanding ability to remove amorphous cellulose and noncellulosic
components from raw RFs, confirmed by the results of chemical composition
analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffractometry.
Overall, this study provided an innovative and effective pretreatment
process for fractionating raw cellulosic fibers, so as to promote
the subsequent preparation of CNFs.

Introduction
Cellulose particles
measuring 100 nm or less in at least one dimension
are referred to as nanocellulose. Due to its natural abundance, renewability,
biodegradability, mechanical durability, and chemical tunability,
nanocellulose is an ideal material to lay the foundation for a new
biopolymer composites industry.1,2 Depending on the cellulosic
sources and the production conditions, nanocellulose can be further
divided into four main categories of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs),
cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), bacterial cellulose (BC), and electrospun
cellulose nanofibers (ECNFs).3,4 Among them, CNCs and
CNFs are generated by the separation of cellulosic fibers into nanosize
fragments (top-down process),5,6 while BC and ECNFs are
produced by a buildup of nanofibers (bottom-up process) from low-molecular-weight
carbohydrates by bacteria7 or from cellulose
solution using an electrospinning technique,8 respectively. Here, we focus our attention on CNFs.

CNFs are
finer cellulose fibrils extracted from wood, plant, algae,
and bacterial source materials by mechanical processes, such as high-pressure
homogenization.9 However, the mechanical
separation of CNFs from cellulosic fibers especially consumes a large
amount of energy because of the cell wall recalcitrance, which results
from a rigid and crystalline structure of cellulose surrounded by
noncellulosic materials like hemicelluloses, lignin, pectin, and protein,
and which also makes cellulose resistant to liquid penetration.10,11 The isolation of CNFs generally requires two successive stages.
The first stage is a pretreatment of the source material by various
pulping and bleaching methods. The particular pretreatment involves
the isolation of individual intact fibers and the partial or complete
elimination of noncellulosic materials.12 The second stage is the mechanical treatment as well as biological
and chemical pretreatments, which involves the disintegration of the
above-mentioned “purified” cellulosic fibers into CNFs.13 However, when compared to the direct use of
raw cellulosic fibers, the pulping and bleaching pretreatments in
the first stage have many drawbacks, including the higher cost of
chemicals, the increased environmental burden (the use of toxic chemicals),
and the lower production yield of CNFs.14,15

In this
study, the ramie fibers (RFs) in their native state were
directly treated for CNF production without the pulping and bleaching
pretreatments. Ramie, which belongs to the Urticaceae family, is a perennial herbaceous plant and an important natural
fiber crop.16 Raw ramie consists of many
individual fibers, which are linked to each other to form a fiber
bundle structure; its main composition is cellulose and the noncellulosic
components such as hemicelluloses, pectin, lignin, waxes, and fats
bind the fiber bundles together.17,18

To facilitate
the disintegration of cellulose microfibrils into
thinner CNFs in the second stage, biological and chemical pretreatments
are usually applied that markedly weaken their interfibrillar hydrogen
bonding: enzymatic hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis,
TEMPO oxidation, carboxymethylation, organic solvents/ionic liquids,
etc.19,20 Unfortunately, biological processes are
expensive and time-consuming, and conventional chemical approaches
also can be costly and toxic. Thus, green and inexpensive chemicals
capable of loosening the cell wall structure are highly desired in
the preparation of CNFs. Recently, a new class of green solvents called
deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as media for biomass processing has
been presented.21,22 A DES usually consists of two
or three cheap and safe components that can associate with each other
to form a eutectic mixture, often through hydrogen bonding.23 Generally, DESs are featured by a melting point
below that of each individual component and being liquid at temperatures
below 100 °C. In most cases, DESs are prepared by mixing a quaternary
ammonium salt as a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) with a melt salt or
hydrogen bond donor (HBD).24 Choline chloride,
featured as a cheap, nontoxic, and biodegradable quaternary ammonium
salt, is often used to form a DES in combination with HBDs, such as
urea, oxalic acid dihydrate, or glycerol. DESs have been used as a
pretreatment for the nanofibrillation of bleached birch kraft pulp,25,26 waste board,27 NaOH-treated grass,28 degummed silk fibers,29 bleached polar kraft pulp,30 and degummed
RFs.31 However, to the best of our knowledge,
the use of DESs for the pretreatment of raw cellulosic fibers prior
to the isolation of CNFs has been rarely reported.

In this work,
DES was applied to examine its effectiveness in pretreating
raw RFs for CNF production. Three representative DESs, namely, choline
chloride–urea (CU), choline chloride–oxalic acid dihydrate
(CO), and choline chloride–glycerol (CG) were selected. Subsequently,
their pretreatment performances were evaluated based on chemical composition
analysis and structural and morphological changes.

Results and Discussion
Chemical
Composition
In this study, three different
DESs were evaluated comparatively for their efficiency in pretreating
raw RFs, and the chemical compositions of un-pretreated and pretreated
RFs are summarized in Table 1. Reaction time was one of the most important factors affecting
the efficiency of the DES pretreatment. Table 1 reflects that the contents of cellulose,
hemicelluloses, pectin, lignin, and water solubles in RFs changed
sharply from 0 to 4 or 6 h with prolonged reaction time and then showed
little changes when the reaction time exceeded 4 or 6 h. However,
no significant changes in the content of waxes were observed with
a further increase in reaction time. Consequently, 6, 4, and 6 h were
determined as appropriate reaction times of CU, CO, and CG treatments,
respectively. It needs to be pointed out here that the CO system could
not be investigated at 8 and 10 h, as the pretreated RFs formed a
highly viscous paste that could not be filtered. A similar observation
was made by Procentese et al.32

The solid
recovery larger than 76% was achieved for CU pretreatment
at 140 °C in this study, while approximately 73% was achieved
with CO at 100 °C and CG at 180 °C (Table 1). The results of this study can be compared
to the data reported by Hou et al.,33 who
investigated rice straw pretreatment using the choline chloride sequences
of DESs. The solid recovery as reported by Hou et al.33 was 78% of
their biomass for choline chloride–urea pretreatment
at 120 °C, being very similar to that obtained here; while 68
and 79.5%, which were slightly different from those obtained here,
were reported for choline chloride–oxalic acid dihydrate at
80 °C and choline chloride–glycerol at 120 °C, respectively.
As shown in Figure 1, both CU and CG pretreatments were quite effective in terms of fractionating
RFs. CU removed 69.23% hemicelluloses, 98.88% pectin, 27.30% lignin,
and 82.08% water solubles, while CG took away 86.89% hemicelluloses,
99.46% pectin, 8.83% lignin, and 91.34% water solubles. However, compared
to CU and CG, CO showed the lowest hemicellulose removal (0.95%),
slightly lower pectin removal (99.64%) and water soluble removal (76.22%),
and slightly higher lignin removal (45.23%). In this study, the content
of hemicelluloses in pretreated RFs was determined by the NaOH method,
which could detect all oligosaccharides containing hemicelluloses
and other oligosaccharides.34 Unlike CU
and CG, CO could induce cellulose hydrolysis during the pretreatment
of lignocellulosic biomass,35 which was
typical for the sulfuric acid hydrolysis of wood pulp for CNC production
and resulted in an increase in cellulose removal and a decrease in
“hemicelluloses” removal (shown in Figure 1). Similar results were reported
by Liu et al.34

Figure 1 Removal of individual
components in pretreated RFs.

FT-IR Analysis
FT-IR analysis was carried out to understand
the effect of DES pretreatment on the chemical structure of pretreated
RFs, and the results obtained from the IR analysis are shown in Figure 2 and Table S1.

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of raw RFs and pretreated
RFs.

The absorbance peaks near 3274
cm–1 correspond
to the free O–H stretching and bending vibrations of the OH
groups of cellulose and lignin.17 The peaks
at 2918 and 2850 cm–1 are due to the stretching
of C–H in cellulose and hemicelluloses.36 The sharp peak at 2918 cm–1 in raw RFs
became a little shoulder in pretreated RFs and the peak at 2850 cm–1 disappeared completely in pretreated RFs. The removal
of hemicelluloses during DES pretreatments, shown in Figure 1, caused these changes in the
peak positions. The peak located at 1733 cm–1 in
raw RFs and CO pretreated RFs is associated to the C=O stretching
vibration in hemicelluloses and lignin,37 or the carbonyl group in carboxyl and esters.38 This peak disappeared in the CU and CG pretreated RFs,
indicating the removal of hemicelluloses and lignin during the DES
pretreatment, while this peak occurred in the CO pretreated RFs, signifying
the esterification reaction between cellulose and oxalic acid during
the DES pretreatment. The bands around 1606 cm–1 in the spectra of all samples represent the O–H bending of
adsorbed water.39 The absorption bands
at 1418 cm–1 (CH2 bending), 1320 cm–1 (C–H bending), 1104 cm–1 (C–O vibration), 1018 cm–1 (C–O–C
stretching), and 895 cm–1 (C–H deformation)
are the typical bonds of cellulose.31,40,41 These bands were present in all of the spectra; however,
the CO-pretreated RFs exhibited stronger absorption intensities, which
could be attributed to the degradation of amorphous cellulose during
the DES pretreatment.34 This result is
consistent with the chemical composition analysis from Figure 1. The peak at 1242 cm–1 in raw RFs is attributed to the C–O stretching in lignins,42 and this peak shifted to lower values at 1202
cm–1 in pretreated RFs, which was regarded as a
reduction in the amount of lignin after the DES pretreatment.

Crystallinity
To determine the effect of DES pretreatment
on the crystallinity of pretreated RFs, XRD analysis was carried out. Figure 3a presents the XRD
patterns obtained for raw RFs and pretreated RFs, and the corresponding
CrIs were calculated and are presented in Figure 3b.

Figure 3 XRD patterns (a) and CrIs (b) of raw RFs and
pretreated RFs.

For real biomass, the measurement
of true cellulose crystallinity
is very difficult because conventional X-ray methods determine the
crystallinity of the entire material including amorphous cellulose,
hemicelluloses, and lignin. However, chemical and physicochemical
pretreatments can alter the crystal structure of the cellulose by
destroying the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in cellulose
chains, and X-ray measurements of CrI are still the best option for
evaluating their effects on biomass crystallinity.43 As shown in Figure 3b, the CrI of RFs was increased from 79.17 to 81.75% after
the CG pretreatment. This was unlikely to reflect an increase in cellulose
crystallinity but revealed only an increase in the proportion of cellulose
in RFs, shown in Table 1.32 However, the CrIs of CU and CO pretreated
RFs were slightly reduced to 77.42 and 77.65%, respectively. According
to previous reports,44,45 the CrI values of cellulose declined
sharply after the same pretreatment process. Putting these two results
together indicates that the relative contents of cellulose in RFs
increased after CU or CO pretreatments, owing to the removal of hemicelluloses,
pectin, and lignin. These results are in perfect accordance with the
results obtained in Table 1.

Morphology
Finally, based on the results from the chemical
composition analysis, FT-IR, and XRD, SEM and AFM were used to find
out the effect of the DES pretreatment on the cell wall ultrastructure
of RFs.

Figure 4A–L illustrates how the fiber morphology was changed from
macro- to microscale by DES pretreatment. When untreated, the cross
section of the harvested, chopped RFs was easily recognizable (Figure 4C), with single raw
fibers composed of individual microfibrils linked by hemicelluloses
and lignin.42 After DES pretreatments,
the digital photographs (Figure 4A,D,G,J) displayed a general trend toward a greater
abundance of long, thin, and individual fibers and a reduction in
the particle size. Especially, the CO-pretreated RFs exhibited the
maximum size reduction and their SEM image revealed the formation
of some transverse cracks on the biomass surface (Figure 4I), which might be due to the
dissolution of amorphous cellulose during the DES pretreatment. These
photographs also showed a color change from light yellow for raw RFs
to nearly white or light brown for pretreated RFs, which was similar
to the result obtained previously with thermochemical alkaline pretreatments.46 In the CU- and CO-pretreated RFs (Figure 4F,I), the coarse surface became
somewhat more loose with the attachment of some small particles, which
might be residual hemicelluloses and lignin aggregates after DES pretreatment.
The similar results explained by the relocalization of hemicelluloses
and lignin were reported during dilute acid pretreatment.47,48 In contrast, Figure 4L shows the surface of the CG-pretreated RFs, which produced the
smoothest and the cleanest surface. This result revealed the effective
removal of a vast majority of noncellulosic components (shown in Table 1) and the efficient
disintegration of bundle fibers into individual/discrete fibers.49 Overall, after DES pretreatments, a partial
lesion of the fiber bundle and a typical weakening of the cell wall
structure were observed in RFs.

Figure 4 Digital photographs and SEM images of
raw RFs and pretreated RFs.

AFM was used to get nanoscale morphological information on the
surface of ramie cell walls. Figure 5A shows the morphology of raw RFs. It clearly appeared
as aggregates of grains covering the surface. It was believed that
the grains mainly consisted of noncellulosic components such as lignin,
waxes, and hemicelluloses.50,51 It is well known that
lignin usually forms aggregates on the surface of plant cell walls
and exists in a grainy shape. Figure 5B–D shows the AFM images of pretreated RFs.
These images clearly revealed the appearance of bundles of cellulose
microfibers, all oriented in the same direction, indicating that most
of the noncellulosic components in RFs were removed after DES pretreatment
(shown in Figure 1).
However, some links oriented perpendicular to the microfiber bundle
were clearly deficient in the features of continuous microfibers (Figure 5B,D). It could be
suggested that these links were chains of residual hemicelluloses
in pretreated RFs.50,52 Particularly, the CO-pretreated
RFs formed a network structure (Figure 5C), which corresponded to a degraded surface in this
case.53 This observation is in agreement
with the SEM analysis from Figure 4I.

Figure 5 AFM images of raw RFs and pretreated RFs.

The findings obtained in this study by different analysis
methods
are summarized in Table 2, which included the comparisons of reaction time, physical changes
after pretreatment, biomass crystallinity, and structural and morphological
changes, along with viscosity of DES.54 Compared to other DESs, CO achieved a higher level of performance
because it exhibited the highest structural disruption, resulting
in the most dramatic changes in RF morphology. Moreover, it had the
lowest reaction temperature with the lowest viscosity among the DESs investigated, implying
less energy consumption and easy solvent handling during the pretreatment
process. Bundles of RFs were not observed after CO pretreatment, which
could be due to the fracturing behavior of long cellulose microfibrils
during the pretreatment process (shown in Figure 4I).

Potential Utilization Methods of Cellulose Nanofibrils
Due to its intrinsic properties, abundance, and renewability, nanocellulose
is involved in the fabrication of a variety of nanomaterials and nanocomposites,
including templating agents, hydrogels, aerogels, nanocellulose–nanocarbon
composites, nanocellulose–organic polymer matrixes, and nanocellulose–inorganic
nanoparticle composites.55 Its applications
include mechanical reinforcement, packaging, medical treatment, sensing,
electronics, energy storage, environmental remediation, catalysis,
and fire prevention. However, how to make better use of CNFs has always
been a concern.

According to Hietala et al.,56 cellulose nanofibers were prepared from sugar beet pulp,
and the reinforcing capability of the obtained nanofibers in the poly(vinyl
alcohol) matrix was studied. Interestingly, the sugar beet nanofibers
containing higher amounts of pectin and hemicellulose resulted in
better redispersion properties and a nanocomposite with better mechanical
properties. Laitinen et al.57 isolated
CNFs from recycled waste fibers by employing a Masuko grinder after
pretreatment with DES. In the following step, a combination of two
types of silylation agents and freeze-drying was used to fabricate
nanostructured aerogels. The obtained CNF aerogels exhibited excellent
absorption performances for cleaning oil and chemical spills. Kumar
et al.58 produced cellulose nanocrystal-reinforced
poly(vinyl alcohol)/silica glass hybrid scaffolds via a freeze-drying
method. The product showed a highly porous structure with an improved
mechanical performance by the addition of cellulose nanocrystals and
silica-based bioactive glass, making it suitable for bone tissue regeneration.
Moreover, recently, some new techniques have emerged to produce both
nanoscale and microscale fibers. These techniques include electrohydrodynamic
processing, centrifugal spinning, and pressurized gyration.59,60 With these techniques, polymer solutions produce micro/nanofibers
in the form of yarns. Since CNFs can be uniformly dispersed in a polymer
solution, they could be spun into fiber mats for preparing nanocomposites
by centrifugal spinning.

Conclusions
In this study, CO showed
the most dramatic morphological changes
of RFs during DES pretreatment, followed by CG and CU. The high capability
to remove amorphous cellulose and noncellulosic components such as
hemicelluloses, water solubles, pectin, and lignin from raw RFs contributed
to its high structural disruption of RFs during the pretreatment process.
This study demonstrated a green pretreatment process with great potential
for the preparation of CNFs from raw cellulosic fibers. A future goal
is to use the raw RFs pretreated with CO for preparing CNFs.

Experimental
Section
Materials
RFs were collected from Changsha Ramie Garden
of Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences. The raw material was air-dried, cut into short fibers (less
than 3 cm in length), and stored in an airtight container at room
temperature prior to use. Choline chloride (≥98%), urea (≥99.5%),
oxalic acid dihydrate (≥98%), and glycerol (≥99.5%)
were obtained from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. All other
chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available.

DES Synthesis
Three different DESs were tested: CU,
CO, and CG in molar ratios of 1:2, 1:1, and 1:2, respectively. The
DESs were synthesized by mixing the two constituents (HBA and HBD),
and then the mixture was heated and stirred in a closed flask at 100
°C in an oil bath to obtain a homogeneous liquid. The synthesized
DESs were stored in a desiccator prior to use.

DES Pretreatment
Two grams of ramie short fibers was
added into 200 g of DES, then the suspension was mixed for 2–10
h at a predetermined temperature (140 °C for CU; 100 °C
for CO; 180 °C for CG). The detailed reaction times used are
presented in Table 1 and the experimental results of different reaction temperatures
are shown in Table S2. After the DES pretreatment,
the mixture was taken away from the heating source (oil bath) and
200 mL of deionized water was added while mixing. Then, the suspension
was filtrated under vacuum and washed with deionized water until the
filtrate ran clear. Finally, the pretreated RFs were dried at 60 °C
and stocked in sealed plastic bags.

Characterization
The chemical composition of RFs was
tested according to the Chinese national standards (see the Supporting Information) of GB5883-8661 and GB5889-86,62 and
expressed as wt % content of waxes, water-soluble components, pectin,
hemicelluloses, lignin, and cellulose.17,49 Each sample
was tested at least three times. Besides, some values were calculated
as follows63 1   2  The functional
groups of RFs were analyzed
using a Nicolet IS10 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer
(Thermo Electron). The data were recorded over the range between 400
and 4000 cm–1 with 32 scans per spectrum and a 4
cm–1 resolution.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns were measured using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker,
Germany) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV
and 40 mA. The diffraction data of RFs were collected in the 2θ
range of 5–40° in steps of 0.02° at a scanning speed
of 4°/min. The crystallinity index (CrI) was measured by the
Segal method as follows (without a baseline substrate)64 3  where I200 is
the peak intensity of the main crystalline plane (200) diffraction
and Iam is the minimum diffraction intensity
at a 2θ angle close to 18°.

The surface morphology
features of RFs were observed using a JSM-6490LV
scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan). The samples were well
scattered on the conducting resin and coated with Au. SEM images were
recorded with a 20 kV acceleration voltage under standard conditions.
Additionally, a Multimode 8 atomic force microscope (Bruker) was used
to characterize slight changes in the surface morphology of the samples.
The scanasyst mode automatically optimized the imaging parameters
with a scan rate of 1 Hz. All images were acquired in air.
