A colorimetric
immunosensor based on
local surface plasmon resonance by gold nanoparticles is presented,
and its application for the detection of human immunoglobulin G (IgG)
is demonstrated. The color change of the colloidal solution is produced
by nanoparticle aggregation, a process that can be tuned by the presence
of the analyte once the nanoparticles are functionalized. In comparison
to common functionalization techniques, the procedure described here
is simpler, low-cost, and effective in binding antibodies upright
on the gold surface. The dose–response curve is similar to
that resulting in typical immunoassay platforms and is satisfactorily
described by the proposed theoretical model. Human IgG at concentration
levels of few hundreds of nanograms per milliliter can be detected
by eyes within a few minutes, thereby making the colorimetric immunosensor
proposed here a powerful tool in several areas, with urine test in
medical diagnostics being the most immediate.

Introduction
Nanoparticle-based
biosensors are often proposed due to their unique
optical properties.1,2 In recent years, considerable
efforts have been directed to develop low-cost, easy, and rapid colorimetric
diagnostics tools for point-of-care application or even for home use,1 for example, for glucose monitoring.3,4 The interaction of light with a metal nanoparticle may induce coherent
and nonpropagating oscillations of free electrons with a resonance
frequency, called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).5,6 The principal effects are the enhancement of the electromagnetic
fields near the nanoparticle surface and the appearance of a strong
extinction peak.7 For gold and silver nanoparticles,
the LSPR falls in the visible range, but gold is generally preferred
due to its biocompatibility,8 inertness,9 and surface chemistry.10 The LSPR depends on the local environment so that a change of the
local refractive index leads to an LSPR spectral shift and also to
a color variation of the colloidal solution.11,12 For their capability of probing a nanoscale region around their
surface, nanoparticles have been successfully employed in molecular
sensing.13−15 The colorimetric sensing based on gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) exploits the color change of the suspension from red to purple
as a result of surface plasmon coupling between nanoparticles, until
the transition from a dispersed to an aggregated state occurs.16−19 AuNP aggregation can be tuned by using biological mechanisms, such
as the antigen–antibody (Ab) interaction.20 To induce AuNP aggregation only in the presence of the
antigen, various strategies have been developed to immobilize properly
oriented antibodies (Abs) on the AuNP surface.21,22 The most used immobilization methods for Abs are based on the decoration
of the AuNP surface with bifunctional or mediator linkers, which often
require long chemical procedures;23−25 moreover, AuNPs suffer
from irreversible aggregation during functionalization with thiolate
ligands.26

Alternative strategies
to Abs for detecting proteins through the
color change of a colloidal solution of AuNPs include the Lac-PEGylation
of the gold surface for detecting Ricinus communis agglutinin,27 aptamer–protein
binding for the recognition of thrombin,28 and lactose-stabilized AuNPs for the assessment of the presence
of cholera toxin in stool.29 Although the
selectivity is satisfactory, all these methods for functionalizing
gold surfaces share long and complex procedures that inherently lead
to the lack of reproducibility.

Recently, we have shown that
Abs can be directly immobilized on
gold surfaces by using a UV light-induced approach, known as photochemical
immobilization technique (PIT).30,31 Briefly, the absorption
of UV light by nearby aromatic amino acids leads to the breakage of
selected disulfide bridges, and the subsequent reactive thiol groups
bind the gold substrate, providing strong anchoring sites. The effectiveness
of PIT has been already demonstrated in several applications to the
gold surface functionalization of quartz crystal microbalances.32−35

In this paper, we show that PIT is effective also with AuNPs,
turning
them into immunoprobes that aggregate in the presence of antigens.
The whole process is depicted in Figure 1, where the first step is AuNP functionalization
by means of UV-activated polyclonal antihuman immunoglobulin G (IgG),
and the aggregation ensues from the multiple binding sites (epitopes)
the antigens exhibit. Because polyclonal Abs and the presence of multiple
binding sites on the antigens are the main conditions for clustering,36 the antigens are symbolized by diamonds to highlight
the generality of the scheme in Figure 1, which is expected to work also with other proteins.
In this respect, although designed for the detection of IgG, the colorimetric
immunoassay and most of the results described in the following are
extendable to other targets.

Figure 1 Detection scheme. The Abs are strongly anchored
upright to AuNPs
as a result of PIT. Because of the presence of multiple binding sites,
the antigens act like linkers and clustering takes place.

Results and Discussion
The synthesized
AuNPs have been characterized by several techniques,
the first of which is absorption spectroscopy (Figure S1), whereas the scanning electron microscope (SEM)
images are reported in Figure 2a, which highlights the presence of quite regular spherical
monodisperse nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 40 nm. Figure 2b shows the UV–vis
absorption spectra of the same AuNPs (solid black line) that reveal
an LSPR band centered at 530.2 nm, as expected for spherical AuNPs
with 40 nm.37 Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements confirmed the AuNP size, providing a hydrodynamic
diameter of about 40 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.2 (Figure S2). The contribution to the intensity
at small hydrodynamics radii comes from the presence of the seeds
formed during nanoparticle synthesis. Nevertheless, the aggregation
process reported in Figure 3 suggests a negligible role played by these impurities in
the whole procedure. The mean ζ potential has been measured
to be −32 ± 1 mV, thereby confirming the existence of
electrostatic repulsion forces among the particles that prevent their
aggregation (Figure S3).

Figure 2 (a) SEM image of the
synthesized AuNPs. (b) UV–vis absorption
spectra of naked nanoparticles (solid black line) and the same after
AuNPs have been functionalized with anti-IgG (dashed red line).

Figure 3 Left panel: SEM images of clusters in solution
as a function of
human IgG. The trend of increasing size is clear until a maximum is
achieved at approximately 350 ng/mL. The subsequent increase to 500
ng/mL prevents AuNPs from forming larger clusters, and the hook effect
takes place, making the cluster size at 500 ng/mL smaller than that
obtained at 350 ng/mL. Right panel: (a) absorption spectra measured
at several human IgG concentrations. The absorption peak is red-shifted
as the concentration increases until a maximum is reached at 350 ng/mL.
At the higher concentration of 500 ng/mL, the peak is shifted toward
lower wavelength. (b) Hydrodynamic diameter measured by DLS shows
the same hook effect reported for the absorption as well as for the
cluster size. (c) Color change induced by particle aggregation. The
layer on the bottom of the cuvette observed at 350 ng/mL is due to
the precipitation caused by the large size of the clusters. This picture
was taken after overnight storage.

After the functionalization with IgG, the solution is centrifuged
and the AuNPs, which constitute the pellet, are resuspended in pure
water. The dotted red line in Figure 2b shows that the functionalized nanoparticles have
the same spectrum only red-shifted by Δλ ∼ 3.4
nm (dotted red line) as a consequence of the protein layer tethered
to the gold surface. The two spectra show the same overall shape and
intensity, thereby demonstrating a successful conjugation of the antibody
to the gold surface, which leads to no lack of AuNP during the centrifugation
and the subsequent change of the solvent.

Because the value
of Δλ can be related to the thickness
of the protein layer, the effectiveness of PIT as a functionalization
technique for AuNP can be further checked by estimating the average
number each nanoparticle binds. Following the discussion reported
by Pollitt et al.,38 we set d as the nanoparticle (gold) core diameter and s as
the dielectric coating thickness so that the fraction, g, of the total nanoparticle that is the shell is achieved by a simple
geometrical consideration, that is 1  In the Rayleigh approximation, the shift of
the resonance peak is38 2  where
λp is the free electron
oscillation wavelength (131 nm for gold), λmax,0 is
the wavelength of maximum absorption for uncoated colloids (530.2
nm for our AuNPs), ε is the relative permittivity (the subscripts
s and m refer to the shell and the surrounding medium, respectively),
and αs = (εs – εm)/(εs + 2εm) is the polarizability
of a sphere of shell dielectric constant, εs (2.02
by assuming the refraction index ns =
1.42 for the protein39), in a medium of
dielectric constant, εm (1.77 by assuming the refraction
index nm = 1.33 for the water). By inverting eq 2, we get g = 0.43, which in turn provides s ∼ 4 nm
through eq 1.

In
a wide range of concentrations, the refractive index is a linear
function of the concentration40 and, hence,
the absolute amount of adsorbed protein, Γ, can be determined
by the De Feijter formula41 3  where
dn/dC is the increment of the refractive
index due to concentration increase,
which assumes a typical value of 0.19 mL/g for protein.42 Thus, eq 3 provides Γ ∼ 200 ng/cm2, which corresponds
to approximately 40 Abs (Ab molecular weight approximately 150 kDa)
around a sphere with d = 40 nm. It is worth observing
that the mean area occupied by each antibody is approximately 10–12 cm2 whose square root is 10 nm, which
corresponds to the linear dimension of the Ab. This result is what
one would expect if the AuNPs are fully covered by antibodies, which
bind the gold surface as reported in our previous paper,31 that is, with one Fab well exposed and the other
Fab tethered to the surface together with Fc.

The formation
of a protein corona around the AuNP surface entails
an increase of the local refractive index, which leads to a red shift
of the resonance peak position. It is worth noticing that the absorption
spectrum of the functionalized AuNPs was recorded after only 5 min
of incubation; although short, this time is more than enough to reach
the equilibrium because no change in the absorption spectrum was observed
after 5 min (Figure S4). Furthermore, the
LSPR peak position was unchanged after both the centrifugation and
the blocking with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Figure S5), suggesting the effectiveness of PIT in AuNPs because
it provides both a stable attachment and a high surface coverage.

The behavior of AuNPs as a biosensor is described in Figure 3, where the left panel reports
the change of cluster size induced by the antigens (human IgGs) that
act as linkers between nanoparticles when grafted on their surface.
The structures reported in the left panel are representative of the
cluster size distributions, the latter being deducible by the SEM
images at lower magnification, reported in Figure S6, for several antigen concentrations. As clearly observable
in Figure 3, the presence
of the analyte promotes aggregation until the optimum concentration
of about 350 ng/mL is reached; after that, further increase of the
concentration hampers the aggregation. This is because beyond such
a value the AuNPs are saturated with the antigens, which do not bind
each other, thereby preventing nanoparticles from aggregating. Such
a dynamics is well-known in immunology as prozone or hook effect and
may give rise to false negative when the analyte concentration is
too high.43 This undesirable effect can
be easily overcome with a double measurement at two different concentrations
(serial dilutions) so that one can easily discriminate whether the
low signal arises from a concentration that is too low or too high.

The optical response of the solution in presence of the analyte
is reported in the right panel of Figure 3 together with the characterization by DLS.
In particular, Figure 3a shows the absorption spectra of the functionalized AuNPs at various
concentrations of human IgG. The spectra are collected after an incubation
of 15′, a time long enough to achieve a condition close to
the equilibrium (see Figure S7). Both the
LSPR peak position and width depend crucially on the amount of human
IgG added to the functionalized AuNPs, thus evidencing the high sensitivity
of the biosensor. The absorbance of the functionalized AuNPs is slightly
lower than that reported in Figure 2 because of the different approach used in removing
the supernatant after the centrifugation; in fact, for sensing purposes,
it is necessary to get rid of the whole supernatant to remove all
of the free Abs in the solution, and this operation unavoidably leads
to the removal of some AuNps. The aggregates are further characterized
by dynamic light scattering, and the intensity distributions of the
particle sizes confirm the hook effect observed in the absorption
spectra. The size of the cluster increases up to a maximum, which
corresponds to a concentration of human IgG of 350 ng/mL; after that,
it reduces (Figure 3b). Interestingly, the size measured by DLS is in good agreement
with that obtained by SEM analysis reported in the left panel of Figure 3, ranging from 42
nm for the bare functionalized AuNPs to a maximum of approximately
800 nm measured when a solution of 350 ng/mL human IgG is mixed with
AuNPs. The last SEM picture in the left panel of Figure 3 (bottom left) still confirms
to a large extent the decrease of the dimensions of AuNPs clusters
to 185 nm as measured by the DLS for larger values of human IgG concentration. Figure 3c reports a picture
of the cuvettes that shows the change of the color induced by the
analyte. In addition, in this case, the hook effect brings about a
return of the color toward red when the human IgG concentration is
larger than 350 ng/mL. At this concentration, the size of the cluster
is so high that particle precipitation occurs, manifesting itself
as a layer at the bottom of the fifth cuvette in Figure 3c.

By comparing the results
presented in Figure 3a,b, we obtain the relation between the red
shift and the dimension of the aggregate reported in Figure 4 (this figure also includes
additional measurements not shown in Figure 3 for the sake of clarity). After a rapid
increase, presumably corresponding to the formation of dimers, the
shift grows roughly linearly with the dimension of the aggregates.
The whole plot evidences the role played by the dipole–dipole
interaction occurring in a nanoparticle aggregate. The quantitative
description of such a process, which depends strongly on parameters
such as the separation distance between the AuNPs and their diameter,
requires numerical modeling, which goes beyond the scope of the present
work. However, the optical properties of gold nanoparticle aggregates
have been addressed in a number of papers, all of them reporting the
occurrence of LSPR red-shift when more particles interact.11,16,44−46 In particular,
it has been shown that a cluster made of 13 AuNPs with a diameter
equal to 40 nm and far apart by a distance that is 20% the diameter
gives rise to a shift that is approximately 2% the wavelength of maximum
absorption for uncoated AuNPs.47 The SEM
pictures shown in the left panel in Figure 3 are obviously taken in vacuum, and as such
the Abs are dried and their size is underestimated. However, from eq 1, we estimated the thickness
of the protein corona as s ∼ 4 nm; thus, by
neglecting the contribution of the linker, the separation distance
in our clusters is ∼8 nm, which corresponds to 20% of the diameter.
Moreover, the size of a cluster made of 13 AuNPs is approximately
150 nm (linear dimension). Strikingly, the plot shown in Figure 4 shows that such
an aggregate provides approximately 10–15 nm red-shift, a value
in excellent agreement with theory.47

Figure 4 Shift
of the wavelength of maximum absorption as a function of
hydrodynamic diameter measured by the DLS.

The shift of the resonance peak wavelength as a function
of human
IgG concentration is reported in Figure 5, which constitutes the dose–response
curve for the colorimetric immunosensor. At human IgG concentration
lower than 20 ng/mL, only a small shift (<2 nm) of the resonance
wavelength is observed, but at higher analyte concentrations, a significant
red-shift occurs, which is responsible for the color change from red
to purple visible in Figure 3c.

Figure 5 Shift of the wavelength of maximum absorption as a function of
analyte concentration (human IgG). The curve is the best fit achieved
with eq 5.

The peak in the dose–response signal and
the region around
it are referred to as hook point and zone of equivalence, respectively.
At concentrations below the hook point, the number of human IgG is
relatively low and aggregation is not optimized (small red-shift),
whereas at concentration of human IgG above the hook point, the binding
sites of the AuNPs tend to saturate again, resulting in a reduced
cross-linking and, hence, a small red-shift is observed again. Although
aggregation dynamics is a complex process and its quantitative description
would require sophisticated approaches of statistical mechanics, we
are able to capture the underlying physics by considering a very simplified
version of the system. Let us consider a colloidal solution made of
two species: functionalized AuNPs that have bound the analyte and
are therefore “saturated” (specie A) and those AuNPs
available to bind the analyte (specie B). The concentrations [A] and
[B] are linked by the relation [A] + [B] = [AuNP]0, the
right-hand side being the initial concentration of AuNP. At equilibrium,
we have 4  and 5  where K is the equilibrium
constant of the reaction B + IgG → A. Thus, the role played
by the analyte (IgG) is to shift the equilibrium between [A] and [B]:
the larger the [IgG], the smaller the [A] and, in turn, the larger
the [B]. The aggregation is a multiple-order complexation between
A and B, and its optical response depends almost linearly on its size
(see Figure 4). Thus,
we expect that the optical response will follow a power law in its
dependence on the product [A][B], that is 6  where R includes both the
nanoparticle concentration and the instrument response.

The
best fit of the experimental data with eq 6 provides Rn = (2000 ± 300)n nm (ng/mL)n, K = 260 ± 20 ng/mL,
and n = 6.3 ± 1.6 and is reported as a solid
line in Figure 5. The
agreement with the experimental data is more than satisfactory and
shows that eq 5, though
simple, is able to capture the essence of a complex process that includes
aggregation of gold nanoparticles and their response to the electromagnetic
field.

By taking three times the standard deviation (±3
nm), a limit
of detection <100 ng/mL (700 pM) can be inferred from the dose–response
curve, whereas the range of the positive response is 50–500
ng/mL. Although this range is of interest in a number of applications,48 in medical diagnostics the IgG concentration
can be much higher, reaching the value of hundreds of micrograms per
milliliter. This issue is addressed by carrying out serial dilution
of the sample, a procedure that is customary in immunoassay.49 The drawback of this procedure is the unfeasibility
of the one-step measurement, but the cost effectiveness of our system,
along with ease of use as well as prompt response, softens this drawback,
making the proposed immunosensor a suitable platform for mass screening.
Moreover, it has to be considered that the aggregation process can
be optimized by properly designing the protein corona,36 whereas the range of positive response of the
immunoassay can be tuned to a large extent by adjusting the concentration
of AuNP probes.50

To evaluate the
specificity of the immunosensor, we checked possible
cross-reactions with a similar protein, that is, the mouse IgG, which
is comparable to the Fc unit. To this end, 4 μL of a solution
containing 50 μg/mL mouse IgG was added to 1 mL of the sensing
solution containing approximately 6 × 1010 AuNPs/mL
(see the Materials and Methods). The absorption
spectra measured after 1 and 24 h incubation showed no change (see Figure S8), thereby demonstrating not only the
lack of any cross-reaction with mouse IgG, but also the long-term
stability of the functionalized colloidal solution.

Conclusions
In this work, we described a colorimetric immunosensor for the
detection of human IgG based on Ab-functionalized gold nanoparticles.
The specificity is inherently warranted by the presence of antibodies
acting as recognition biomolecules, whereas the performances in terms
of sensitivity and limit of detection allow its application in a number
of circumstances where fast response is required, even if it is of
“on–off” type. The stability of the colloidal
solution is noticeable thanks to the photochemical immobilization
technique we have adopted for the functionalization. The presence
of human IgG is visualized as a change of the color the solution undergoes
due to the formation of aggregates. Such a process is very similar
to that occurring in the agglutination tests and has been analyzed
by a simple theoretical model that captures the main features of the
dose–response curve, particularly the prozone effect. The possible
artifacts brought about by this effect can be easily overcome by serial
dilutions made affordable by the prompt response (few minutes) and
ease of use shown by the immunosensor proposed here. The positive
response range for IgG is 50–500 ng/mL, thereby making it suitable
for application to medical diagnostic in a number of circumstances,
for instance, for detecting proteinuria, a pathological condition
in which IgG concentration reaches values much larger than 1 mg/mL.51 Such a concentration can be easily detected
by our immunosensor with 1:1000 dilution (or more), which would fully
preserve the solvent characteristics and the nanoparticle stability.
The application of the whole procedure
to other analytes, but even the study of the role played by the diameter
of the nanoparticles in the aggregation process, will be the next
steps of this research.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Gold(III)
chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium
citrate, and bovine serum albumin
(BSA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Goat antihuman IgG, human
IgG, and IgG from mouse were obtained from ImmunoReagents, Inc. Ultrapure
water from Milli-Q system was used for all preparations.

Synthesis of
AuNPs
Spherical gold nanoparticles were
synthesized by modifying an already-existing protocol.38 A gold salt solution composed of 50 mL of ultrapure
water and 500 μL and 8 mg/mL of HAuCl4·3H2O was prepared and boiled under constant stirring. Thus, 6
mL of 10 mg/mL sodium citrate was added, and the resulting solution
was boiled for 2 min to achieve particles nucleation. After that,
4.8 mL of 8 mg/mL HAuCl4·3H2O was added
to induce particles growth, and the stirring of the boiling solution
was continued for 2 min. At the end of this process, the color of
the suspension turned dark red, with the absorption spectrum shown
in Figure S1, from which the optical density
of approximately 0.6 at 450 nm allowed us to estimate the AuNP concentration
as 6 × 1010 AuNPs/mL.52 Afterward, the AuNPs colloid was stored in the dark at 4 °C.

PIT-Functionalization of AuNPs
To remove impurities
present in the stock solution, 1 mL of AuNPs was centrifuged at 3000
g for 10 min; then, the supernatant was discarded and the AuNP pellet
was resuspended in ultrapure water. A solution of 50 μg/mL antihuman
IgG was prepared and irradiated for 1 min with a HERAEUS amalgam-type
NNI 40/20 lamp emitting at 254 nm with a power of 40 W. The lamp is
approximately 20 cm long and has a diameter of 1 cm so that the intensity
is about 0.7 W/cm2, very close to the surface. By considering
that the cuvette containing the antihuman IgG solution is located
at 1 cm from the lamp surface, the effective irradiation intensity
used for the antibody activation is about 0.3 W/cm2. A
volume of 20 μL of the irradiated antihuman IgG solution was
added to 1 mL of AuNPs, and the resulting mixture was incubated for
3 min. The amount of antihuman IgG present in the mixture was progressively
increased by adding 4 μL of the irradiated antibody solution.
The UV–vis absorption spectra showed red shift of the maximum
absorption wavelength as a result of the formation of the protein
corona. Only few spikes were necessary to stabilize the red shift;
thus, a total number of five additions, corresponding to 1 μg/mL
antihuman IgG concentration, were chosen to ensure the maximum coverage
of the AuNP surfaces. The unbound antibodies were removed from the
mixture by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min, and the antihuman
IgG functionalized AuNP pellet was resuspended in ultrapure water.
After that, 1 mg/mL BSA was added to the functionalized colloid to
block the AuNP surface from nonspecific adsorption.

Colorimetric
Immunoassay
Various amounts of human IgG
in the range of 5 ng/mL to 1 μg/mL were added to 1 mL of aliquots
of the antihuman IgG functionalized AuNPs, and the samples were incubated
at room temperature. Then, UV–vis absorption spectra from 400
to 700 nm were collected at different incubation times to study the
optical response of the system and how it changed in time.

Instruments
UV–vis absorption spectroscopy and
dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used here to characterize both
bare and antihuman IgG functionalized AuNPs and to study the optical
response of the functionalized colloid in presence of the antigen
human IgG. The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a
Jenway 6715 UV/vis spectrophotometer with 0.1 nm resolution and 0.2
nm spectral bandwidth. DLS measurements were conducted using a Zetasizer
Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments) equipped with a 633 nm He–Ne
laser and an avalanche photodiode detector placed at the detection
angle of 173°. The same instrument was able to perform ζ-potential
measurements based on laser Doppler microelectrophoresis.

The
morphology of the synthesized AuNPs was analyzed by a Zeiss ∑IGMA
field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with a nominal
resolution of ∼3 nm at 1 kV. SEM images of the sample surface
have been registered by recording secondary electrons (SEs) using
both an Everhart-Thornley and an In-Lens (IL) detector. The IL detector,
located inside the electron column of the microscope and arranged
rotationally symmetric around its axis, allows the collection of SE
with high efficiency. Therefore, the IL detector provides SEM images
with higher contrast that are used to obtain zoomed views of sample
portions with higher magnification. FESEM has also been used to image
the clusters made of the antihuman IgG functionalized AuNPs induced
by the human IgG.
